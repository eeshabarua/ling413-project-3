76,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
77,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
78,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,THOU couldst not look on me and live: so runs
79,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,The mortal legend--thou that couldst not live
80,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Nor look on me (so the divine decree)!
81,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"That saw'st me in the cloud, the wave, the bough,"
82,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"The clod commoved with April, and the shapes"
83,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Lurking 'twixt lid and eye-ball in the dark.
84,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Mocked I thee not in every guise of life,"
85,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Hid in girls' eyes, a naiad in her well,"
86,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Wooed through their laughter, and like echo fled,"
87,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Luring thee down the primal silences
88,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Where the heart hushes and the flesh is dumb?
89,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Nay, was not I the tide that drew thee out"
90,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Relentlessly from the detaining shore,"
91,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Forth from the home-lights and the hailing voices,"
92,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Forth from the last faint headland's failing line,"
93,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Till I enveloped thee from verge to verge
94,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,And hid thee in the hollow of my being?
95,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"And still, because between us hung the veil,"
96,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"The myriad-tinted veil of sense, thy feet"
97,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Refused their rest, thy hands the gifts of life,"
98,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Thy heart its losses, lest some lesser face"
99,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Should blur mine image in thine upturned soul
100,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Ere death had stamped it there. This was thy thought.
101,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,And mine?
102,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
103,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"The gods, they say, have all: not so!"
104,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"This have they--flocks on every hill, the blue"
105,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Spirals of incense and the amber drip
106,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Of lucid honey-comb on sylvan shrines,"
107,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"First-chosen weanlings, doves immaculate,"
108,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Twin-cooing in the osier-plaited cage,"
109,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,And ivy-garlands glaucous with the dew:
110,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Man's wealth, man's servitude, but not himself!"
111,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"And so they pale, for lack of warmth they wane,"
112,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Freeze to the marble of their images,"
113,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"And, pinnacled on man's subserviency,"
114,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Through the thick sacrificial haze discern
115,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Unheeding lives and loves, as some cold peak"
116,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Through icy mists may enviously descry
117,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Warm vales unzoned to the all-fruitful sun.
118,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,So they along an immortality
119,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Of endless-envistaed homage strain their gaze,"
120,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"If haply some rash votary, empty-urned,"
121,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"But light of foot, with all-adventuring hand,"
122,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Break rank, fling past the people and the priest,"
123,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Up the last step, on to the inmost shrine,"
124,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"And there, the sacred curtain in his clutch,"
125,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Drop dead of seeing--while the others prayed!
126,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Yes, this we wait for, this renews us, this"
127,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Incarnates us, pale people of your dreams,"
128,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Who are but what you make us, wood or stone,"
129,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Or cold chryselephantine hung with gems,"
130,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Or else the beating purpose of your life,"
131,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Your sword, your clay, the note your pipe pursues,"
132,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"The face that haunts your pillow, or the light"
133,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Scarce visible over leagues of labouring sea!
134,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"_O thus through use to reign again, to drink_"
135,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"_The cup of peradventure to the lees,_"
136,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,_For one dear instant disimmortalised_
137,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,_In giving immortality!_
138,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,So dream the gods upon their listless thrones.
139,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Yet sometimes, when the votary appears,"
140,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"With death-affronting forehead and glad eyes,"
141,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"_Too young_, they rather muse, _too frail thou art,_"
142,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,_And shall we rob some girl of saffron veil_
143,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,_And nuptial garland for so slight a thing?_
144,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,And so to their incurious loves return.
145,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
146,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Not so with thee; for some indeed there are
147,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Who would behold the truth and then return
148,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,To pine among the semblances--but I
149,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Divined in thee the questing foot that never
150,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Revisits the cold hearth of yesterday
151,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Or calls achievement home. I from afar
152,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Beheld thee fashioned for one hour's high use,"
153,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop.
154,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Long, long hadst thou inhabited my dreams,"
155,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Surprising me as harts surprise a pool,"
156,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Stealing to drink at midnight; I divined
157,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Thee rash to reach the heart of life, and lie"
158,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Bosom to bosom in occasion's arms.
159,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,And said: _Because I love thee thou shalt die!_
160,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
161,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,For immortality is not to range
162,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Unlimited through vast Olympian days,"
163,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Or sit in dull dominion over time;
164,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"But this--to drink fate's utmost at a draught,"
165,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip,"
166,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"To scale the summit of some soaring moment,"
167,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Nor know the dulness of the long descent,"
168,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,To snatch the crown of life and seal it up
169,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,Secure forever in the vaults of death!
170,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
171,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"And this was thine: to lose thyself in me,"
172,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Relive in my renewal, and become"
173,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"The light of other lives, a quenchless torch"
174,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,"Passed on from hand to hand, till men are dust"
175,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,And the last garland withers from my shrine.
176,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
177,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
178,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
179,ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON,
180,LIFE,LIFE
181,LIFE,
182,LIFE,
183,LIFE,"NAY, lift me to thy lips, Life, and once more"
184,LIFE,Pour the wild music through me--
185,LIFE,
186,LIFE,"I quivered in the reed-bed with my kind,"
187,LIFE,"Rooted in Lethe-bank, when at the dawn"
188,LIFE,There came a groping shape of mystery
189,LIFE,"Moving among us, that with random stroke"
190,LIFE,"Severed, and rapt me from my silent tribe,"
191,LIFE,"Pierced, fashioned, lipped me, sounding for a voice,"
192,LIFE,Laughing on Lethe-bank--and in my throat
193,LIFE,"I felt the wing-beat of the fledgeling notes,"
194,LIFE,The bubble of godlike laughter in my throat.
195,LIFE,
196,LIFE,"Such little songs she sang,"
197,LIFE,"Pursing her lips to fit the tiny pipe,"
198,LIFE,They trickled from me like a slender spring
199,LIFE,"That strings frail wood-growths on its crystal thread,"
200,LIFE,"Nor dreams of glassing cities, bearing ships."
201,LIFE,"She sang, and bore me through the April world"
202,LIFE,"Matching the birds, doubling the insect-hum"
203,LIFE,"In the meadows, under the low-moving airs,"
204,LIFE,And breathings of the scarce-articulate air
205,LIFE,When it makes mouths of grasses--but when the sky
206,LIFE,"Burst into storm, and took great trees for pipes,"
207,LIFE,"She thrust me in her breast, and warm beneath"
208,LIFE,"Her cloudy vesture, on her terrible heart,"
209,LIFE,"I shook, and heard the battle."
210,LIFE,
211,LIFE,"But more oft,"
212,LIFE,"Those early days, we moved in charmed woods,"
213,LIFE,"Where once, at dusk, she piped against a faun,"
214,LIFE,And one warm dawn a tree became a nymph
215,LIFE,Listening; and trembled; and Life laughed and passed.
216,LIFE,And once we came to a great stream that bore
217,LIFE,"The stars upon its bosom like a sea,"
218,LIFE,And ships like stars; so to the sea we came.
219,LIFE,"And there she raised me to her lips, and sent"
220,LIFE,"One swift pang through me; then refrained her hand,"
221,LIFE,"And whispered: ""Hear--"" and into my frail flanks,"
222,LIFE,"Into my bursting veins, the whole sea poured"
223,LIFE,Its spaces and its thunder; and I feared.
224,LIFE,
225,LIFE,"We came to cities, and Life piped on me"
226,LIFE,"Low calls to dreaming girls,"
227,LIFE,"In counting-house windows, through the chink of gold,"
228,LIFE,"Flung cries that fired the captive brain of youth,"
229,LIFE,And made the heavy merchant at his desk
230,LIFE,Curse us for a cracked hurdy-gurdy; Life
231,LIFE,"Mimicked the hurdy-gurdy, and we passed."
232,LIFE,
233,LIFE,"We climbed the slopes of solitude, and there"
234,LIFE,"Life met a god, who challenged her and said:"
235,LIFE,"""Thy pipe against my lyre!"" But ""Wait!"" she laughed,"
236,LIFE,"And in my live flank dug a finger-hole,"
237,LIFE,"And wrung new music from it. Ah, the pain!"
238,LIFE,
239,LIFE,"We climbed and climbed, and left the god behind."
240,LIFE,"We saw the earth spread vaster than the sea,"
241,LIFE,"With infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow,"
242,LIFE,And a silence that was louder than the deep;
243,LIFE,But on the utmost pinnacle Life again
244,LIFE,"Hid me, and I heard the terror in her hair."
245,LIFE,
246,LIFE,"Safe in new vales, I ached for the old pang,"
247,LIFE,"And clamoured ""Play me against a god again!"""
248,LIFE,"""Poor Marsyas-mortal--he shall bleed thee yet,"""
249,LIFE,"She breathed and kissed me, stilling the dim need."
250,LIFE,"But evermore it woke, and stabbed my flank"
251,LIFE,With yearnings for new music and new pain.
252,LIFE,"""Another note against another god!"""
253,LIFE,"I clamoured; and she answered: ""Bide my time."
254,LIFE,"Of every heart-wound I will make a stop,"
255,LIFE,"And drink thy life in music, pang by pang,"
256,LIFE,But first thou must yield the notes I stored in thee
257,LIFE,"At dawn beside the river. Take my lips."""
258,LIFE,
259,LIFE,"She kissed me like a lover, but I wept,"
260,LIFE,"Remembering that high song against the god,"
261,LIFE,"And the old songs slept in me, and I was dumb."
262,LIFE,
263,LIFE,"We came to cavernous foul places, blind"
264,LIFE,"With harpy-wings, and sulphurous with the glare"
265,LIFE,"Of sinful furnaces--where hunger toiled,"
266,LIFE,"And pleasure gathered in a starveling prey,"
267,LIFE,And death fed delicately on young bones.
268,LIFE,
269,LIFE,"""Now sing!"" cried Life, and set her lips to me."
270,LIFE,"""Here are gods also. Wilt thou pipe for Dis?"""
271,LIFE,"My cry was drowned beneath the furnace roar,"
272,LIFE,Choked by the sulphur-fumes; and beast-lipped gods
273,LIFE,"Laughed down on me, and mouthed the flutes of hell."
274,LIFE,
275,LIFE,"""Now sing!"" said Life, reissuing to the stars;"
276,LIFE,And wrung a new note from my wounded side.
277,LIFE,
278,LIFE,"So came we to clear spaces, and the sea."
279,LIFE,"And now I felt its volume in my heart,"
280,LIFE,"And my heart waxed with it, and Life played on me"
281,LIFE,"The song of the Infinite. ""Now the stars,"" she said."
282,LIFE,
283,LIFE,Then from the utmost pinnacle again
284,LIFE,"She poured me on the wild sidereal stream,"
285,LIFE,"And I grew with her great breathings, till we swept"
286,LIFE,The interstellar spaces like new worlds
287,LIFE,Loosed from the fiery ruin of a star.
288,LIFE,
289,LIFE,"Cold, cold we rested on black peaks again,"
290,LIFE,"Under black skies, under a groping wind;"
291,LIFE,"And Life, grown old, hugged me to a numb breast,"
292,LIFE,Pressing numb lips against me. Suddenly
293,LIFE,A blade of silver severed the black peaks
294,LIFE,"From the black sky, and earth was born again,"
295,LIFE,"Breathing and various, under a god's feet."
296,LIFE,A god! A god! I felt the heart of Life
297,LIFE,"Leap under me, and my cold flanks shook again."
298,LIFE,"He bore no lyre, he rang no challenge out,"
299,LIFE,"But Life warmed to him, warming me with her,"
300,LIFE,And as he neared I felt beneath her hands
301,LIFE,The stab of a new wound that sucked my soul
302,LIFE,Forth in a new song from my throbbing throat.
303,LIFE,
304,LIFE,"""His name--his name?"" I whispered, but she shed"
305,LIFE,"The music faster, and I grew with it,"
306,LIFE,"Became a part of it, while Life and I"
307,LIFE,"Clung lip to lip, and I from her wrung song"
308,LIFE,"As she from me, one song, one ecstasy,"
309,LIFE,"In indistinguishable union blent,"
310,LIFE,Till she became the flute and I the player.
311,LIFE,And lo! the song I played on her was more
312,LIFE,Than any she had drawn from me; it held
313,LIFE,"The stars, the peaks, the cities, and the sea,"
314,LIFE,"The faun's catch, the nymph's tremor, and the heart"
315,LIFE,"Of dreaming girls, of toilers at the desk,"
316,LIFE,"Apollo's challenge on the sunrise slope,"
317,LIFE,And the hiss of the night-gods mouthing flutes of hell--
318,LIFE,"All, to the dawn-wind's whisper in the reeds,"
319,LIFE,"When Life first came, a shape of mystery,"
320,LIFE,"Moving among us, and with random stroke"
321,LIFE,"Severed, and rapt me from my silent tribe."
322,LIFE,"All this I wrung from her in that deep hour,"
323,LIFE,"While Love stood murmuring: ""Play the god, poor grass!"""
324,LIFE,
325,LIFE,"Now, by that hour, I am a mate to thee"
326,LIFE,"Forever, Life, however spent and clogged,"
327,LIFE,And tossed back useless to my native mud!
328,LIFE,"Yea, groping for new reeds to fashion thee"
329,LIFE,"New instruments of anguish and delight,"
330,LIFE,"Thy hand shall leap to me, thy broken reed,"
331,LIFE,"Thine ear remember me, thy bosom thrill"
332,LIFE,"With the old subjection, then when Love and I"
333,LIFE,"Held thee, and fashioned thee, and made thee dance"
334,LIFE,"Like a slave-girl to her pipers--yea, thou yet"
335,LIFE,"Shalt hear my call, and dropping all thy toys"
336,LIFE,"Thou'lt lift me to thy lips, Life, and once more"
337,LIFE,Pour the wild music through me--
338,LIFE,

342,LIFE,VESALIUS IN ZANTE (See note at end)
343,LIFE,
344,LIFE,(1564)
345,LIFE,
346,LIFE,
347,LIFE,SET wide the window. Let me drink the day.
348,LIFE,"I loved light ever, light in eye and brain--"
349,LIFE,"No tapers mirrored in long palace floors,"
350,LIFE,"Nor dedicated depths of silent aisles,"
351,LIFE,But just the common dusty wind-blown day
352,LIFE,That roofs earth's millions.
353,LIFE,
354,LIFE,"O, too long I walked"
355,LIFE,"In that thrice-sifted air that princes breathe,"
356,LIFE,Nor felt the heaven-wide jostling of the winds
357,LIFE,And all the ancient outlawry of earth!
358,LIFE,Now let me breathe and see.
359,LIFE,
360,LIFE,This pilgrimage
361,LIFE,They call a penance--let them call it that!
362,LIFE,I set my face to the East to shrive my soul
363,LIFE,Of mortal sin? So be it. If my blade
364,LIFE,"Once questioned living flesh, if once I tore"
365,LIFE,"The pages of the Book in opening it,"
366,LIFE,See what the torn page yielded ere the light
367,LIFE,Had paled its buried characters--and judge!
368,LIFE,
369,LIFE,"The girl they brought me, pinioned hand and foot"
370,LIFE,In catalepsy--say I should have known
371,LIFE,"That trance had not yet darkened into death,"
372,LIFE,"And held my scalpel. Well, suppose I _knew?_"
373,LIFE,Sum up the facts--her life against her death.
374,LIFE,Her life? The scum upon the pools of pleasure
375,LIFE,Breeds such by thousands. And her death? Perchance
376,LIFE,"The obolus to appease the ferrying Shade,"
377,LIFE,And waft her into immortality.
378,LIFE,Think what she purchased with that one heart-flutter
379,LIFE,That whispered its deep secret to my blade!
380,LIFE,"For, just because her bosom fluttered still,"
381,LIFE,It told me more than many rifled graves;
382,LIFE,"Because I spoke too soon, she answered me,"
383,LIFE,Her vain life ripened to this bud of death
384,LIFE,"As the whole plant is forced into one flower,"
385,LIFE,All her blank past a scroll on which God wrote
386,LIFE,"His word of healing--so that the poor flesh,"
387,LIFE,"Which spread death living, died to purchase life!"
388,LIFE,
389,LIFE,"Ah, no! The sin I sinned was mine, not theirs."
390,LIFE,Not _that_ they sent me forth to wash away--
391,LIFE,"None of their tariffed frailties, but a deed"
392,LIFE,So far beyond their grasp of good or ill
393,LIFE,"That, set to weigh it in the Church's balance,"
394,LIFE,Scarce would they know which scale to cast it in.
395,LIFE,"But I, I know. I sinned against my will,"
396,LIFE,"Myself, my soul--the God within the breast:"
397,LIFE,Can any penance wash such sacrilege?
398,LIFE,
399,LIFE,"When I was young in Venice, years ago,"
400,LIFE,"I walked the hospice with a Spanish monk,"
401,LIFE,"A solitary cloistered in high thoughts,"
402,LIFE,"The great Loyola, whom I reckoned then"
403,LIFE,"A mere refurbisher of faded creeds,"
404,LIFE,"Expert to edge anew the arms of faith,"
405,LIFE,"As who should say, a Galenist, resolved"
406,LIFE,"To hold the walls of dogma against fact,"
407,LIFE,"Experience, insight, his own self, if need be!"
408,LIFE,"Ah, how I pitied him, mine own eyes set"
409,LIFE,"Straight in the level beams of Truth, who groped"
410,LIFE,In error's old deserted catacombs
411,LIFE,And lit his tapers upon empty graves!
412,LIFE,"Ay, but he held his own, the monk--more man"
413,LIFE,"Than any laurelled cripple of the wars,"
414,LIFE,"Charles's spent shafts; for what he willed he willed,"
415,LIFE,"As those do that forerun the wheels of fate,"
416,LIFE,"Not take their dust--that force the virgin hours,"
417,LIFE,Hew life into the likeness of themselves
418,LIFE,And wrest the stars from their concurrences.
419,LIFE,So firm his mould; but mine the ductile soul
420,LIFE,That wears the livery of circumstance
421,LIFE,And hangs obsequious on its suzerain's eye.
422,LIFE,"For who rules now? The twilight-flitting monk,"
423,LIFE,"Or I, that took the morning like an Alp?"
424,LIFE,"He held his own, I let mine slip from me,"
425,LIFE,The birthright that no sovereign can restore;
426,LIFE,And so ironic Time beholds us now
427,LIFE,"Master and slave--he lord of half the earth,"
428,LIFE,I ousted from my narrow heritage.
429,LIFE,
430,LIFE,For there's the sting! My kingdom knows me not.
431,LIFE,Reach me that folio--my usurper's title!
432,LIFE,"Fallopius reigning, _vice_--nay, not so:"
433,LIFE,"Successor, not usurper. I am dead."
434,LIFE,My throne stood empty; he was heir to it.
435,LIFE,"Ay, but who hewed his kingdom from the waste,"
436,LIFE,"Cleared, inch by inch, the acres for his sowing,"
437,LIFE,"Won back for man that ancient fief o' the Church,"
438,LIFE,"His body? Who flung Galen from his seat,"
439,LIFE,And founded the great dynasty of truth
440,LIFE,In error's central kingdom?
441,LIFE,
442,LIFE,"Ask men that,"
443,LIFE,And see their answer: just a wondering stare
444,LIFE,To learn things were not always as they are--
445,LIFE,The very fight forgotten with the fighter;
446,LIFE,Already grows the moss upon my grave!
447,LIFE,"Ay, and so meet--hold fast to that, Vesalius."
448,LIFE,"They only, who re-conquer day by day"
449,LIFE,"The inch of ground they camped on over-night,"
450,LIFE,Have right of foothold on this crowded earth.
451,LIFE,I left mine own; he seized it; with it went
452,LIFE,"My name, my fame, my very self, it seems,"
453,LIFE,"Till I am but the symbol of a man,"
454,LIFE,The sign-board creaking o'er an empty inn.
455,LIFE,"He names me--true! _Oh, give the door its due_"
456,LIFE,"_I entered by. Only, I pray you, note,_"
457,LIFE,"_Had door been none, a shoulder-thrust of mine_"
458,LIFE,"_Had breached the crazy wall""_--he seems to say."
459,LIFE,"So meet--and yet a word of thanks, of praise,"
460,LIFE,"Of recognition that the clue was found,"
461,LIFE,"Seized, followed, clung to, by some hand now dust--"
462,LIFE,Had this obscured his quartering of my shield?
463,LIFE,
464,LIFE,How the one weakness stirs again! I thought
465,LIFE,I had done with that old thirst for gratitude
466,LIFE,That lured me to the desert years ago.
467,LIFE,I did my work--and was not that enough?
468,LIFE,"No; but because the idlers sneered and shrugged,"
469,LIFE,"The envious whispered, the traducers lied,"
470,LIFE,And friendship doubted where it should have cheered
471,LIFE,"I flung aside the unfinished task, sought praise"
472,LIFE,"Outside my soul's esteem, and learned too late"
473,LIFE,"That victory, like God's kingdom, is within."
474,LIFE,"(Nay, let the folio rest upon my knee."
475,LIFE,I do not feel its weight.) Ingratitude?
476,LIFE,The hurrying traveller does not ask the name
477,LIFE,Of him who points him on his way; and this
478,LIFE,"Fallopius sits in the mid-heart of me,"
479,LIFE,"Because he keeps his eye upon the goal,"
480,LIFE,"Cuts a straight furrow to the end in view,"
481,LIFE,"Cares not who oped the fountain by the way,"
482,LIFE,But drinks to draw fresh courage for his journey.
483,LIFE,That was the lesson that Ignatius taught--
484,LIFE,"The one I might have learned from him, but would not--"
485,LIFE,"That we are but stray atoms on the wind,"
486,LIFE,"A dancing transiency of summer eves,"
487,LIFE,"Till we become one with our purpose, merged"
488,LIFE,In that vast effort of the race which makes
489,LIFE,Mortality immortal.
490,LIFE,
491,LIFE,"_""He that loseth_"
492,LIFE,"_His life shall find it"":_ so the Scripture runs."
493,LIFE,"But I so hugged the fleeting self in me,"
494,LIFE,"So loved the lovely perishable hours,"
495,LIFE,"So kissed myself to death upon their lips,"
496,LIFE,That on one pyre we perished in the end--
497,LIFE,A grimmer bonfire than the Church e'er lit!
498,LIFE,Yet all was well--or seemed so--till I heard
499,LIFE,"That younger voice, an echo of my own,"
500,LIFE,"And, like a wanderer turning to his home,"
501,LIFE,"Who finds another on the hearth, and learns,"
502,LIFE,"Half-dazed, that other is his actual self"
503,LIFE,"In name and claim, as the whole parish swears,"
504,LIFE,"So strangely, suddenly, stood dispossessed"
505,LIFE,"Of that same self I had sold all to keep,"
506,LIFE,A baffled ghost that none would see or hear!
507,LIFE,"_""Vesalius? Who's Vesalius? This Fallopius_"
508,LIFE,"_It is who dragged the Galen-idol down,_"
509,LIFE,_Who rent the veil of flesh and forced a way_
510,LIFE,"_Into the secret fortalice of life""_--"
511,LIFE,Yet it was I that bore the brunt of it!
512,LIFE,
513,LIFE,"Well, better so! Better awake and live"
514,LIFE,"My last brief moment as the man I was,"
515,LIFE,Than lapse from life's long lethargy to death
516,LIFE,Without one conscious interval. At least
517,LIFE,"I repossess my past, am once again"
518,LIFE,No courtier med'cining the whims of kings
519,LIFE,"In muffled palace-chambers, but the free"
520,LIFE,"Friendless Vesalius, with his back to the wall"
521,LIFE,"And all the world against him. O, for that"
522,LIFE,"Best gift of all, Fallopius, take my thanks--"
523,LIFE,"That, and much more. At first, when Padua wrote:"
524,LIFE,"""Master, Fallopius dead, resume again"
525,LIFE,"The chair even he could not completely fill,"
526,LIFE,And see what usury age shall take of youth
527,LIFE,"In honours forfeited""--why, just at first,"
528,LIFE,I was quite simply credulously glad
529,LIFE,"To think the old life stood ajar for me,"
530,LIFE,Like a fond woman's unforgetting heart.
531,LIFE,But now that death waylays me--now I know
532,LIFE,"This isle is the circumference of my days,"
533,LIFE,And I shall die here in a little while--
534,LIFE,"So also best, Fallopius!"
535,LIFE,
536,LIFE,For I see
537,LIFE,"The gods may give anew, but not restore;"
538,LIFE,"And though I think that, in my chair again,"
539,LIFE,I might have argued my supplanters wrong
540,LIFE,"In this or that--this Cesalpinus, say,"
541,LIFE,"With all his hot-foot blundering in the dark,"
542,LIFE,"Fabricius, with his over-cautious clutch"
543,LIFE,On Galen (systole and diastole
544,LIFE,"Of Truth's mysterious heart!)--yet, other ways,"
545,LIFE,It may be that this dying serves the cause.
546,LIFE,For Truth stays not to build her monument
547,LIFE,"For this or that co-operating hand,"
548,LIFE,"But props it with her servants' failures--nay,"
549,LIFE,"Cements its courses with their blood and brains,"
550,LIFE,A living substance that shall clinch her walls
551,LIFE,"Against the assaults of time. Already, see,"
552,LIFE,"Her scaffold rises on my hidden toil,"
553,LIFE,I but the accepted premiss whence must spring
554,LIFE,The airy structure of her argument;
555,LIFE,Nor could the bricks it rests on serve to build
556,LIFE,The crowning finials. I abide her law:
557,LIFE,A different substance for a different end--
558,LIFE,Content to know I hold the building up;
559,LIFE,"Though men, agape at dome and pinnacles,"
560,LIFE,"Guess not, the whole must crumble like a dream"
561,LIFE,But for that buried labour underneath.
562,LIFE,"Yet, Padua, I had still my word to say!"
563,LIFE,"_Let others say it!_--Ah, but will they guess"
564,LIFE,"Just the one word--? Nay, Truth is many-tongued."
565,LIFE,"What one man failed to speak, another finds"
566,LIFE,Another word for. May not all converge
567,LIFE,"In some vast utterance, of which you and I,"
568,LIFE,"Fallopius, were but halting syllables?"
569,LIFE,"So knowledge come, no matter how it comes!"
570,LIFE,"No matter whence the light falls, so it fall!"
571,LIFE,"Truth's way, not mine--that I, whose service failed"
572,LIFE,"In action, yet may make amends in praise."
573,LIFE,"Fabricius, Cesalpinus, say your word,"
574,LIFE,"Not yours, or mine, but Truth's, as you receive it!"
575,LIFE,"You miss a point I saw? See others, then!"
576,LIFE,Misread my meaning? Yet expound your own!
577,LIFE,"Obscure one space I cleared? The sky is wide,"
578,LIFE,And you may yet uncover other stars.
579,LIFE,For thus I read the meaning of this end:
580,LIFE,There are two ways of spreading light: to be
581,LIFE,The candle or the mirror that reflects it.
582,LIFE,I let my wick burn out--there yet remains
583,LIFE,To spread an answering surface to the flame
584,LIFE,That others kindle.
585,LIFE,
586,LIFE,Turn me in my bed.
587,LIFE,The window darkens as the hours swing round;
588,LIFE,"But yonder, look, the other casement glows!"
589,LIFE,Let me face westward as my sun goes down.

594,MARGARET OF CORTONA,MARGARET OF CORTONA
595,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
596,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
597,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"FRA PAOLO, since they say the end is near,"
598,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And you of all men have the gentlest eyes,"
599,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Most like our father Francis; since you know
600,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"How I have toiled and prayed and scourged and striven,"
601,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Mothered the orphan, waked beside the sick,"
602,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Gone empty that mine enemy might eat,"
603,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Given bread for stones in famine years, and channelled"
604,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"With vigilant knees the pavement of this cell,"
605,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Till I constrained the Christ upon the wall
606,MARGARET OF CORTONA,To bend His thorn-crowned Head in mute forgiveness . . .
607,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Three times He bowed it . . . (but the whole stands writ,"
608,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Sealed with the Bishop's signet, as you know),"
609,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Once for each person of the Blessed Three--
610,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"A miracle that the whole town attests,"
611,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"The very babes thrust forward for my blessing,"
612,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And either parish plotting for my bones--
613,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Since this you know: sit near and bear with me.
614,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
615,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"I have lain here, these many empty days"
616,MARGARET OF CORTONA,I thought to pack with Credos and Hail Marys
617,MARGARET OF CORTONA,So close that not a fear should force the door--
618,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"But still, between the blessed syllables"
619,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"That taper up like blazing angel heads,"
620,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Praise over praise, to the Unutterable,"
621,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Strange questions clutch me, thrusting fiery arms,"
622,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"As though, athwart the close-meshed litanies,"
623,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"My dead should pluck at me from hell, with eyes"
624,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Alive in their obliterated faces! . . .
625,MARGARET OF CORTONA,I have tried the saints' names and our blessed Mother's
626,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Fra Paolo, I have tried them o'er and o'er,"
627,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And like a blade bent backward at first thrust
628,MARGARET OF CORTONA,They yield and fail me--and the questions stay.
629,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And so I thought, into some human heart,"
630,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Pure, and yet foot-worn with the tread of sin,"
631,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"If only I might creep for sanctuary,"
632,MARGARET OF CORTONA,It might be that those eyes would let me rest. . .
633,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
634,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Fra Paolo, listen. How should I forget"
635,MARGARET OF CORTONA,The day I saw him first? (You know the one.)
636,MARGARET OF CORTONA,I had been laughing in the market-place
637,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"With others like me, I the youngest there,"
638,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Jostling about a pack of mountebanks
639,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Like flies on carrion (I the youngest there!),"
640,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Till darkness fell; and while the other girls
641,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Turned this way, that way, as perdition beckoned,"
642,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"I, wondering what the night would bring, half hoping:"
643,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"_If not, this once, a child's sleep in my garret,_"
644,MARGARET OF CORTONA,_At least enough to buy that two-pronged coral_
645,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"_The others covet 'gainst the evil eye,_"
646,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"_Since, after all, one sees that I'm the youngest_--"
647,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"So, muttering my litany to hell"
648,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"(The only prayer I knew that was not Latin),"
649,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Felt on my arm a touch as kind as yours,"
650,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And heard a voice as kind as yours say ""Come."""
651,MARGARET OF CORTONA,I turned and went; and from that day I never
652,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Looked on the face of any other man.
653,MARGARET OF CORTONA,So much is known; so much effaced; the sin
654,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Cast like a plague-struck body to the sea,"
655,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Deep, deep into the unfathomable pardon--"
656,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"(The Head bowed thrice, as the whole town attests)."
657,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"What more, then? To what purpose? Bear with me!--"
658,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
659,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"It seems that he, a stranger in the place,"
660,MARGARET OF CORTONA,First noted me that afternoon and wondered:
661,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"_How grew so white a bud in such black slime,_"
662,MARGARET OF CORTONA,_And why not mine the hand to pluck it out?_
663,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Why, so Christ deals with souls, you cry--what then?"
664,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Not so! Not so! When Christ, the heavenly gardener,"
665,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Plucks flowers for Paradise (do I not know?),"
666,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"He snaps the stem above the root, and presses"
667,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"The ransomed soul between two convent walls,"
668,MARGARET OF CORTONA,A lifeless blossom in the Book of Life.
669,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"But when my lover gathered me, he lifted"
670,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Stem, root and all--ay, and the clinging mud--"
671,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And set me on his sill to spread and bloom
672,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"After the common way, take sun and rain,"
673,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And make a patch of brightness for the street,"
674,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Though raised above rough fingers--so you make
675,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"A weed a flower, and others, passing, think:"
676,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"""Next ditch I cross, I'll lift a root from it,"
677,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And dress my window"" . . . and the blessing spreads."
678,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Well, so I grew, with every root and tendril"
679,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Grappling the secret anchorage of his love,"
680,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And so we loved each other till he died. . . .
681,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
682,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Ah, that black night he left me, that dead dawn"
683,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"I found him lying in the woods, alive"
684,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"To gasp my name out and his life-blood with it,"
685,MARGARET OF CORTONA,As though the murderer's knife had probed for me
686,MARGARET OF CORTONA,In his hacked breast and found me in each wound. . .
687,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Well, it was there Christ came to me, you know,"
688,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And led me home--just as that other led me.
689,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"_(Just as that other?_ Father, bear with me!)"
690,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"My lover's death, they tell me, saved my soul,"
691,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And I have lived to be a light to men.
692,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And gather sinners to the knees of grace.
693,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"All this, you say, the Bishop's signet covers."
694,MARGARET OF CORTONA,But stay! Suppose my lover had not died?
695,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"(At last my question! Father, help me face it.)"
696,MARGARET OF CORTONA,I say: Suppose my lover had not died--
697,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Think you I ever would have left him living,"
698,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Even to be Christ's blessed Margaret?
699,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"--We lived in sin? Why, to the sin I died to"
700,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"That other was as Paradise, when God"
701,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Walks there at eventide, the air pure gold,"
702,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And angels treading all the grass to flowers!
703,MARGARET OF CORTONA,He was my Christ--he led me out of hell--
704,MARGARET OF CORTONA,He died to save me (so your casuists say!)--
705,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Could Christ do more? Your Christ out-pity mine?
706,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Why, _yours_ but let the sinner bathe His feet;"
707,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Mine raised her to the level of his heart. . .
708,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And then Christ's way is saving, as man's way"
709,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Is squandering--and the devil take the shards!
710,MARGARET OF CORTONA,But this man kept for sacramental use
711,MARGARET OF CORTONA,The cup that once had slaked a passing thirst;
712,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"This man declared: ""The same clay serves to model"
713,MARGARET OF CORTONA,A devil or a saint; the scribe may stain
714,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"The same fair parchment with obscenities,"
715,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Or gild with benedictions; nay,"" he cried,"
716,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"""Because a satyr feasted in this wood,"
717,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And fouled the grasses with carousing foot,"
718,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Shall not a hermit build his chapel here
719,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And cleanse the echoes with his litanies?
720,MARGARET OF CORTONA,The sodden grasses spring again--why not
721,MARGARET OF CORTONA,The trampled soul? Is man less merciful
722,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Than nature, good more fugitive than grass?"""
723,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And so--if, after all, he had not died,"
724,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And suddenly that door should know his hand,"
725,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And with that voice as kind as yours he said:
726,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"""Come, Margaret, forth into the sun again,"
727,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Back to the life we fashioned with our hands
728,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Out of old sins and follies, fragments scorned"
729,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Of more ambitious builders, yet by Love,"
730,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"The patient architect, so shaped and fitted"
731,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"That not a crevice let the winter in--"""
732,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Think you my bones would not arise and walk,"
733,MARGARET OF CORTONA,This bruised body (as once the bruised soul)
734,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Turn from the wonders of the seventh heaven
735,MARGARET OF CORTONA,As from the antics of the market-place?
736,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"If this could be (as I so oft have dreamed),"
737,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"I, who have known both loves, divine and human,"
738,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Think you I would not leave this Christ for that?
739,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
740,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"--I rave, you say? You start from me, Fra Paolo?"
741,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Go, then; your going leaves me not alone."
742,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"I marvel, rather, that I feared the question,"
743,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Since, now I name it, it draws near to me"
744,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"With such dear reassurance in its eyes,"
745,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And takes your place beside me. . .
746,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
747,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Nay, I tell you,"
748,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Fra Paolo, I have cried on all the saints--"
749,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"If this be devil's prompting, let them drown it"
750,MARGARET OF CORTONA,In Alleluias! Yet not one replies.
751,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"And, for the Christ there--is He silent too?"
752,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"_Your_ Christ? Poor father; you that have but one,"
753,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And that one silent--how I pity you!
754,MARGARET OF CORTONA,He will not answer? Will not help you cast
755,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"The devil out? But hangs there on the wall,"
756,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Blind wood and bone--?
757,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
758,MARGARET OF CORTONA,How if _I_ call on Him--
759,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"I, whom He talks with, as the town attests?"
760,MARGARET OF CORTONA,If ever prayer hath ravished me so high
761,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"That its wings failed and dropped me in Thy breast,"
762,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Christ, I adjure Thee! By that naked hour"
763,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Of innermost commixture, when my soul"
764,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Contained Thee as the paten holds the host,"
765,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Judge Thou alone between this priest and me;
766,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Nay, rather, Lord, between my past and present,"
767,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Thy Margaret and that other's--whose she is
768,MARGARET OF CORTONA,By right of salvage--and whose call should follow!
769,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Thine? Silent still.--Or his, who stooped to her,"
770,MARGARET OF CORTONA,And drew her to Thee by the bands of love?
771,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Not Thine? Then his?
772,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
773,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Ah, Christ--the thorn-crowned Head"
774,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Bends . . . bends again . . . down on your knees,"
775,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
776,MARGARET OF CORTONA,Fra Paolo!
777,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"If his, then Thine!"
778,MARGARET OF CORTONA,
779,MARGARET OF CORTONA,"Kneel, priest, for this is heaven. . ."

1274,ORPHEUS,"There, solitary by the Stygian tide,"
1275,ORPHEUS,"Strayed her dear feet, the shadow of his own,"
1276,ORPHEUS,"Since, 'mid the desolate millions who have died,"
1277,ORPHEUS,Each phantom walks its crowded path alone;
1278,ORPHEUS,"And there her head, that slept upon his breast,"
1279,ORPHEUS,"No more had such sweet harbour for its rest,"
1280,ORPHEUS,Nor her swift ear from those disvoiced throats
1281,ORPHEUS,"Could catch one echo of his living notes,"
1282,ORPHEUS,"And, dreaming nightly of her pallid doom,"
1283,ORPHEUS,"No solace had he of his own young bloom,"
1284,ORPHEUS,But yearned to pour his blood into her veins
1285,ORPHEUS,And buy her back with unimagined pains.
1286,ORPHEUS,
1287,ORPHEUS,To whom the Shepherd of the Shadows said:
1288,ORPHEUS,"""Yea, many thus would bargain for their dead;"
1289,ORPHEUS,But when they hear my fatal gateway clang
1290,ORPHEUS,Life quivers in them with a last sweet pang.
1291,ORPHEUS,"They see the smoke of home above the trees,"
1292,ORPHEUS,The cordage whistles on the harbour breeze;
1293,ORPHEUS,The beaten path that wanders to the shore
1294,ORPHEUS,"Grows dear because they shall not tread it more,"
1295,ORPHEUS,The dog that drowsing on their threshold lies
1296,ORPHEUS,"Looks at them with their childhood in his eyes,"
1297,ORPHEUS,And in the sunset's melancholy fall
1298,ORPHEUS,"They read a sunrise that shall give them all."""
1299,ORPHEUS,
1300,ORPHEUS,"""Not thus am I,"" the Harper smiled his scorn."
1301,ORPHEUS,"""I see no path but those her feet have worn;"
1302,ORPHEUS,"My roof-tree is the shadow of her hair,"
1303,ORPHEUS,And the light breaking through her long despair
1304,ORPHEUS,The only sunrise that mine eyelids crave;
1305,ORPHEUS,For doubly dead without me in the grave
1306,ORPHEUS,"Is she who, if my feet had gone before,"
1307,ORPHEUS,"Had found life dark as death's abhorred shore."""
1308,ORPHEUS,
1309,ORPHEUS,"The gate clanged on him, and he went his way"
1310,ORPHEUS,"Amid the alien millions, mute and grey,"
1311,ORPHEUS,"Swept like a cold mist down an unlit strand,"
1312,ORPHEUS,"Where nameless wreckage gluts the stealthy sand,"
1313,ORPHEUS,Drift of the cockle-shells of hope and faith
1314,ORPHEUS,Wherein they foundered on the rock of death.
1315,ORPHEUS,
1316,ORPHEUS,So came he to the image that he sought
1317,ORPHEUS,"(Less living than her semblance in his thought),"
1318,ORPHEUS,"Who, at the summons of his thrilling notes,"
1319,ORPHEUS,Drew back to life as a drowned creature floats
1320,ORPHEUS,Back to the surface; yet no less is dead.
1321,ORPHEUS,And cold fear smote him till she spoke and said:
1322,ORPHEUS,"""Art thou then come to lay thy lips on mine,"
1323,ORPHEUS,And pour thy life's libation out like wine?
1324,ORPHEUS,"Shall I, through thee, revisit earth again,"
1325,ORPHEUS,"Traverse the shining sea, the fruitful plain,"
1326,ORPHEUS,"Behold the house we dwelt in, lay my head"
1327,ORPHEUS,"Upon the happy pillows of our bed,"
1328,ORPHEUS,And feel in dreams the pressure of thine arms
1329,ORPHEUS,Kindle these pulses that no memory warms?
1330,ORPHEUS,Nay: give me for a space upon thy breast
1331,ORPHEUS,Death's shadowy substitute for rapture--rest;
1332,ORPHEUS,"Then join again the joyous living throng,"
1333,ORPHEUS,"And give me life, but give it in thy song;"
1334,ORPHEUS,For only they that die themselves may give
1335,ORPHEUS,"Life to the dead: and I would have thee live."""
1336,ORPHEUS,
1337,ORPHEUS,Fear seized him closer than her arms; but he
1338,ORPHEUS,"Answered: ""Not so--for thou shalt come with me!"
1339,ORPHEUS,"I sought thee not that we should part again,"
1340,ORPHEUS,But that fresh joy should bud from the old pain;
1341,ORPHEUS,"And the gods, if grudgingly their gifts they make,"
1342,ORPHEUS,"Yield all to them that without asking take."""
1343,ORPHEUS,
1344,ORPHEUS,"""The gods,"" she said, ""(so runs life's ancient lore)"
1345,ORPHEUS,"Yield all man takes, but always claim their score."
1346,ORPHEUS,The iron wings of the Eumenides
1347,ORPHEUS,When heard far off seem but a summer breeze;
1348,ORPHEUS,But me thou'lt have alive on earth again
1349,ORPHEUS,Only by paying here my meed of pain.
1350,ORPHEUS,Then lay on my cold lips the tender ghost
1351,ORPHEUS,"Of the dear kiss that used to warm them most,"
1352,ORPHEUS,"Take from my frozen hands thy hands of fire,"
1353,ORPHEUS,"And of my heart-strings make thee a new lyre,"
1354,ORPHEUS,"That in thy music men may find my voice,"
1355,ORPHEUS,"And something of me still on earth rejoice."""
1356,ORPHEUS,
1357,ORPHEUS,"Shuddering he heard her, but with close-flung arm"
1358,ORPHEUS,Swept her resisting through the ghostly swarm.
1359,ORPHEUS,"""Swift, hide thee 'neath my cloak, that we may glide"
1360,ORPHEUS,"Past the dim warder as the gate swings wide."""
1361,ORPHEUS,"He whirled her with him, lighter than a leaf"
1362,ORPHEUS,Unwittingly whirled onward by a brief
1363,ORPHEUS,Autumnal eddy; but when the fatal door
1364,ORPHEUS,"Suddenly yielded him to life once more,"
1365,ORPHEUS,And issuing to the all-consoling skies
1366,ORPHEUS,"He turned to seek the sunlight in her eyes,"
1367,ORPHEUS,He clutched at emptiness--she was not there;
1368,ORPHEUS,And the dim warder answered to his prayer:
1369,ORPHEUS,"""Only once have I seen the wonder wrought."
1370,ORPHEUS,"But when Alcestis thus her master sought,"
1371,ORPHEUS,"Living she sought him not, nor dreamed that fate"
1372,ORPHEUS,For any subterfuge would swing my gate.
1373,ORPHEUS,"Loving, she gave herself to livid death,"
1374,ORPHEUS,"Joyous she bought his respite with her breath,"
1375,ORPHEUS,"Came, not embodied, but a tenuous shade,"
1376,ORPHEUS,In whom her rapture a great radiance made.
1377,ORPHEUS,For never saw I ghost upon this shore
1378,ORPHEUS,"Shine with such living ecstasy before,"
1379,ORPHEUS,Nor heard an exile from the light above
1380,ORPHEUS,Hail me with smiles: _Thou art not Death but Love!_
1381,ORPHEUS,
1382,ORPHEUS,"""But when the gods, frustrated, this beheld,"
1383,ORPHEUS,"How, living still, among the dead she dwelled,"
1384,ORPHEUS,"Because she lived in him whose life she won,"
1385,ORPHEUS,"And her blood beat in his beneath the sun,"
1386,ORPHEUS,They reasoned: 'When the bitter Stygian wave
1387,ORPHEUS,"The sweetness of love's kisses cannot lave,"
1388,ORPHEUS,When the pale flood of Lethe washes not
1389,ORPHEUS,"From mortal mind one high immortal thought,"
1390,ORPHEUS,"Akin to us the earthly creature grows,"
1391,ORPHEUS,Since nature suffers only what it knows.
1392,ORPHEUS,If she whom we to this grey desert banned
1393,ORPHEUS,Still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land
1394,ORPHEUS,"That for his sake she left without a tear,"
1395,ORPHEUS,Set wide the gates--her being is not here.'
1396,ORPHEUS,
1397,ORPHEUS,"""So ruled the gods; but thou, that sought'st to give"
1398,ORPHEUS,"Thy life for love, yet for thyself wouldst live."
1399,ORPHEUS,They know not for their kin; but back to earth
1400,ORPHEUS,"Give, pitying, one that is of mortal birth."""
1401,ORPHEUS,
1402,ORPHEUS,"Humbled the Harper heard, and turned away,"
1403,ORPHEUS,Mounting alone to the empoverished day;
1404,ORPHEUS,"Yet, as he left the Stygian shades behind,"
1405,ORPHEUS,"He heard the cordage on the harbour wind,"
1406,ORPHEUS,"Saw the blue smoke above the homestead trees,"
1407,ORPHEUS,And in his hidden heart was glad of these.

1933,A MEETING,"Note.--Vesalius, the great anatomist, studied at Louvain and Paris,"
1934,A MEETING,and was called by Venice to the chair of surgery in the University
1935,A MEETING,of Padua. He was one of the first physiologists to dissect the human
1936,A MEETING,"body, and his great work ""The Structure of the Human Body"" was an"
1937,A MEETING,open attack on the physiology of Galen. The book excited such
1938,A MEETING,"violent opposition, not only in the Church but in the University,"
1939,A MEETING,that in a fit of discouragement he burned his remaining manuscripts
1940,A MEETING,"and accepted the post of physician at the Court of Charles V., and"
1941,A MEETING,"afterward of his son, Philip II, of Spain. This closed his life of"
1942,A MEETING,"free enquiry, for the Inquisition forbade all scientific research,"
1943,A MEETING,and the dissection of corpses was prohibited in Spain. Vesalius led
1944,A MEETING,"for many years the life of the rich and successful court physician,"
1945,A MEETING,"but regrets for his past were never wholly extinguished, and in 1561"
1946,A MEETING,they were roused afresh by the reading of an anatomical treatise by
1947,A MEETING,"Gabriel Fallopius, his successor in the chair at Padua. From that"
1948,A MEETING,"moment life in Spain became intolerable to Vesalius, and in 1563 he"
1949,A MEETING,set out for the East. Tradition reports that this journey was a
1950,A MEETING,penance to which the Church condemned him for having opened the body
1951,A MEETING,"of a woman before she was actually dead; but more probably Vesalius,"
1952,A MEETING,"sick of his long servitude, made the pilgrimage a pretext to escape"
1953,A MEETING,from Spain.
