193,INDEX,The Path to Home
194,INDEX,
195,INDEX,
196,INDEX,"There's the mother at the doorway, and the children at the gate,"
197,INDEX,And the little parlor windows with the curtains white and straight.
198,INDEX,"There are shaggy asters blooming in the bed that lines the fence,"
199,INDEX,And the simplest of the blossoms seems of mighty consequence.
200,INDEX,"Oh, there isn't any mansion underneath God's starry dome"
201,INDEX,That can rest a weary pilgrim like the little place called home.
202,INDEX,
203,INDEX,Men have sought for gold and silver; men have dreamed at night of fame;
204,INDEX,In the heat of youth they've struggled for achievement's honored name;
205,INDEX,"But the selfish crowns are tinsel, and their shining jewels paste,"
206,INDEX,And the wine of pomp and glory soon grows bitter to the taste.
207,INDEX,"For there's never any laughter, howsoever far you roam,"
208,INDEX,Like the laughter of the loved ones in the happiness of home.
209,INDEX,
210,INDEX,"There is nothing so important as the mother's lullabies,"
211,INDEX,"Filled with peace and sweet contentment, when the moon begins to rise--"
212,INDEX,Nothing real except the beauty and the calm upon her face
213,INDEX,And the shouting of the children as they scamper round the place.
214,INDEX,For the greatest of man's duties is to keep his loved ones glad
215,INDEX,And to have his children glory in the father they have had.
216,INDEX,
217,INDEX,"So where'er a man may wander, and whatever be his care,"
218,INDEX,You'll find his soul still stretching to the home he left somewhere.
219,INDEX,"You'll find his dreams all tangled up with hollyhocks in bloom,"
220,INDEX,"And the feet of little children that go racing through a room,"
221,INDEX,With the happy mother smiling as she watches them at play--
222,INDEX,"These are all in life that matter, when you've stripped the sham away."
223,INDEX,
224,INDEX,
225,INDEX,
226,INDEX,
227,INDEX,Fine
228,INDEX,
229,INDEX,
230,INDEX,"Isn't it fine when the day is done,"
231,INDEX,"And the petty battles are lost or won,"
232,INDEX,"When the gold is made and the ink is dried,"
233,INDEX,To quit the struggle and turn aside
234,INDEX,"To spend an hour with your boy in play,"
235,INDEX,And let him race all of your cares away?
236,INDEX,
237,INDEX,"Isn't it fine when the day's gone well,"
238,INDEX,"When you have glorious tales to tell,"
239,INDEX,And your heart is light and your head is high.
240,INDEX,"For nothing has happened to make you sigh,"
241,INDEX,To hurry homewards to share the joy
242,INDEX,That your work has won with a little boy?
243,INDEX,
244,INDEX,"Isn't it fine, whether good or bad"
245,INDEX,"Has come to the hopes and the plans you had,"
246,INDEX,"And the day is over, to find him there,"
247,INDEX,"Thinking you splendid and just and fair,"
248,INDEX,"Ready to chase all your griefs away,"
249,INDEX,And soothe your soul with an hour of play?
250,INDEX,
251,INDEX,"Oh, whether the day's been long or brief,"
252,INDEX,"Whether it's brought to me joy or grief,"
253,INDEX,"Whether I've failed, or whether I've won,"
254,INDEX,It shall matter not when the work is done;
255,INDEX,I shall count it fine if I end each day
256,INDEX,With a little boy in an hour of play.

261,INDEX,Spoiling Them
262,INDEX,
263,INDEX,
264,INDEX,"""You're spoiling them!"" the mother cries"
265,INDEX,When I give way to weepy eyes
266,INDEX,"And let them do the things they wish,"
267,INDEX,"Like cleaning up the jelly dish,"
268,INDEX,"Or finishing the chocolate cake,"
269,INDEX,Or maybe let the rascal take
270,INDEX,"My piece of huckleberry pie,"
271,INDEX,Because he wants it more than I.
272,INDEX,
273,INDEX,"""You're spoiling them!"" the mother tells,"
274,INDEX,"When I am heedless to their yells,"
275,INDEX,And let them race and romp about
276,INDEX,And do not put their joy to rout.
277,INDEX,"I know I should be firm, and yet"
278,INDEX,I tried it once to my regret;
279,INDEX,I will remember till I'm old
280,INDEX,The day I started in to scold.
281,INDEX,
282,INDEX,"I stamped my foot and shouted: ""Stop!"""
283,INDEX,"And Bud just let his drum sticks drop,"
284,INDEX,"And looked at me, and turned away;"
285,INDEX,That night there was no further play.
286,INDEX,"The girls were solemn-like and still,"
287,INDEX,"Just as girls are when they are ill,"
288,INDEX,"And when unto his cot I crept,"
289,INDEX,I found him sobbing as he slept.
290,INDEX,
291,INDEX,That was my first attempt and last
292,INDEX,To play the scold. I'm glad it passed
293,INDEX,So quickly and has left no trace
294,INDEX,Of memory on each little face;
295,INDEX,But now when mother whispers low:
296,INDEX,"""You're spoiling them,"" I answer, ""No!"
297,INDEX,"But it is plain, as plain can be,"
298,INDEX,"Those little tykes are spoiling me."""

304,INDEX,
305,INDEX,
306,INDEX,"There's nothing cheers a fellow up just like a hearty greeting,"
307,INDEX,A handclasp and an honest smile that flash the joy of meeting;
308,INDEX,"And when at friendly doors you ring, somehow it seems to free you"
309,INDEX,"From all life's doubts to hear them say: ""Come in! We're glad to"
310,INDEX,"see you!"""
311,INDEX,
312,INDEX,"At first the portal slips ajar in answer to your ringing,"
313,INDEX,"And then your eyes meet friendly eyes, and wide the door goes flinging;"
314,INDEX,"And something seems to stir the soul, however troubled be you,"
315,INDEX,"If but the cheery host exclaims: ""Come in! We're glad to see you!"""

320,INDEX,Our House
321,INDEX,
322,INDEX,
323,INDEX,"We play at our house and have all sorts of fun,"
324,INDEX,An' there's always a game when the supper is done;
325,INDEX,"An' at our house there's marks on the walls an' the stairs,"
326,INDEX,An' some terrible scratches on some of the chairs;
327,INDEX,"An' ma says that our house is really a fright,"
328,INDEX,But pa and I say that our house is all right.

333,INDEX,An' he's all out of breath when the fightin' is through;
334,INDEX,"An' ma says that our house is surely a sight,"
335,INDEX,But pa an' I say that our house is all right.
336,INDEX,
337,INDEX,I've been to houses with pa where I had
338,INDEX,"To sit in a chair like a good little lad,"
339,INDEX,"An' there wasn't a mark on the walls an' the chairs,"
340,INDEX,An' the stuff that we have couldn't come up to theirs;
341,INDEX,An' pa said to ma that for all of their joy
342,INDEX,He wouldn't change places an' give up his boy.
343,INDEX,
344,INDEX,"They never have races nor rassles nor fights,"
345,INDEX,Coz they have no children to play with at nights;
346,INDEX,"An' their walls are all clean an' their curtains hang straight,"
347,INDEX,An' everything's shiny an' right up to date;
348,INDEX,"But pa says with all of its racket an' fuss,"
349,INDEX,He'd rather by far live at our house with us.

354,INDEX,A Plea
355,INDEX,
356,INDEX,
357,INDEX,God grant me these: the strength to do
358,INDEX,Some needed service here;
359,INDEX,The wisdom to be brave and true;
360,INDEX,"The gift of vision clear,"
361,INDEX,That in each task that comes to me
362,INDEX,Some purpose I may plainly see.
363,INDEX,
364,INDEX,God teach me to believe that I
365,INDEX,"Am stationed at a post,"
366,INDEX,"Although the humblest 'neath the sky,"
367,INDEX,Where I am needed most.
368,INDEX,"And that, at last, if I do well"
369,INDEX,My humble services will tell.
370,INDEX,
371,INDEX,"God grant me faith to stand on guard,"
372,INDEX,"Uncheered, unspoke, alone,"
373,INDEX,And see behind such duty hard
374,INDEX,My service to the throne.
375,INDEX,"Whate'er my task, be this my creed:"
376,INDEX,I am on earth to fill a need.

387,INDEX,"""Tell us a tale of pirates bold,"
388,INDEX,"Or fairies hiding in the glen,"
389,INDEX,"Or of a ship that's wrecked at sea."""
390,INDEX,"I fill my pipe, and there and then"
391,INDEX,Gather the children round my knee.
392,INDEX,
393,INDEX,I give them all a role to play--
394,INDEX,"No longer are they youngsters small,"
395,INDEX,"And I, their daddy, turning gray;"
396,INDEX,"We are adventurers, one and all."
397,INDEX,We journey forth as Robin Hood
398,INDEX,"In search of treasure, or to do"
399,INDEX,Some deed of daring or of good;
400,INDEX,Our hearts are ever brave and true.
401,INDEX,
402,INDEX,We take a solemn oath to be
403,INDEX,Defenders of the starry flag;
404,INDEX,"We brave the winter's stormy sea,"
405,INDEX,"Or climb the rugged mountain crag,"
406,INDEX,To battle to the death with those
407,INDEX,Who would defame our native land;
408,INDEX,We pitch our camp among the snows
409,INDEX,Or on the tropics' burning sand.
410,INDEX,
411,INDEX,"We rescue maidens, young and fair,"
412,INDEX,Held captive long in prison towers;
413,INDEX,"We slay the villain in his lair,"
414,INDEX,For we're possessed of magic powers.
415,INDEX,"And though we desperately fight,"
416,INDEX,"When by our foes are we beset,"
417,INDEX,We always triumph for the right;
418,INDEX,We have not lost a battle yet.
419,INDEX,
420,INDEX,"It matters not how far we stray,"
421,INDEX,"Nor where our battle lines may be,"
422,INDEX,We never get so far away
423,INDEX,That we must spend a night at sea.
424,INDEX,"It matters not how high we climb,"
425,INDEX,"How many foes our pathway block,"
426,INDEX,We always conquer just in time
427,INDEX,To go to bed at 9 o'clock.

431,INDEX,
432,INDEX,The Mother Watch
433,INDEX,
434,INDEX,
435,INDEX,She never closed her eyes in sleep till we were all in bed;
436,INDEX,On party nights till we came home she often sat and read.
437,INDEX,"We little thought about it then, when we were young and gay,"
438,INDEX,How much the mother worried when we children were away.
439,INDEX,"We only knew she never slept when we were out at night,"
440,INDEX,And that she waited just to know that we'd come home all right.
441,INDEX,
442,INDEX,"Why, sometimes when we'd stayed away till one or two or three,"
443,INDEX,It seemed to us that mother heard the turning of the key;
444,INDEX,"For always when we stepped inside she'd call and we'd reply,"
445,INDEX,But we were all too young back then to understand just why.
446,INDEX,"Until the last one had returned she always kept a light,"
447,INDEX,For mother couldn't sleep until she'd kissed us all good night.
448,INDEX,
449,INDEX,She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest;
450,INDEX,She seemed to fear the world might harm the ones she loved the best.
451,INDEX,"And once she said: ""When you are grown to women and to men,"
452,INDEX,"Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through; I may be different then."""
453,INDEX,And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care--
454,INDEX,That always when we got back home we'd find her waiting there.
455,INDEX,
456,INDEX,Then came the night that we were called to gather round her bed:
457,INDEX,"""The children all are with you now,"" the kindly doctor said."
458,INDEX,And in her eyes there gleamed again the old-time tender light
459,INDEX,That told she had been waiting just to know we were all right.
460,INDEX,"She smiled the old-familiar smile, and prayed to God to keep"
461,INDEX,"Us safe from harm throughout the years, and then she went to sleep."

468,INDEX,
469,INDEX,"I look into the faces of the people passing by,"
470,INDEX,"The glad ones and the sad ones, and the lined with misery,"
471,INDEX,And I wonder why the sorrow or the twinkle in the eye;
472,INDEX,But the pale and weary faces are the ones that trouble me.
473,INDEX,
474,INDEX,"I saw a face this morning, and time was when it was fair;"
475,INDEX,"Youth had brushed it bright with color in the distant long ago,"
476,INDEX,"And the goddess of the lovely once had kept a temple there,"
477,INDEX,But the cheeks were pale with grieving and the eyes were dull with woe.
478,INDEX,
479,INDEX,Who has done this thing I wondered; what has wrought the ruin here?
480,INDEX,Why these sunken cheeks and pallid where the roses once were pink?
481,INDEX,Why has beauty fled her palace; did some vandal hand appear?
482,INDEX,Did her lover prove unfaithful or her husband take to drink?
483,INDEX,
484,INDEX,Once the golden voice of promise whispered sweetly in her ears;
485,INDEX,She was born to be a garden where the smiles of love might lurk;
486,INDEX,"Now the eyes that shone like jewels are but gateways for her tears,"
487,INDEX,"And she takes her place among us, toilers early bound for work."
488,INDEX,
489,INDEX,"Is it fate that writes so sadly, or the cruelty of man?"
490,INDEX,What foul deed has marred the parchment of a life so fair as this?
491,INDEX,"Who has wrecked this lovely temple and destroyed the Maker's plan,"
492,INDEX,Raining blows on cheeks of beauty God had fashioned just to kiss?
493,INDEX,
494,INDEX,"Oh, the pale and weary faces of the people that I see"
495,INDEX,"Are the ones that seem to haunt me, and I pray to God above"
496,INDEX,That such cruel desolation shall not ever come to be
497,INDEX,Stamped forever in the future on the faces that I love.

502,INDEX,The Lost Purse
503,INDEX,
504,INDEX,
505,INDEX,I remember the excitement and the terrible alarm
506,INDEX,That worried everybody when William broke his arm;
507,INDEX,An' how frantic Pa and Ma got only jes' the other day
508,INDEX,When they couldn't find the baby coz he'd up an' walked away;
509,INDEX,But I'm sure there's no excitement that our house has ever shook
510,INDEX,Like the times Ma can't remember where she's put her pocketbook.
511,INDEX,
512,INDEX,When the laundry man is standin' at the door an' wants his pay
513,INDEX,"Ma hurries in to get it, an' the fun starts right away."
514,INDEX,"She hustles to the sideboard, coz she knows exactly where"
515,INDEX,"She can put her hand right on it, but alas! it isn't there."
516,INDEX,"She tries the parlor table an' she goes upstairs to look,"
517,INDEX,An' once more she can't remember where she put her pocketbook.
518,INDEX,
519,INDEX,"She tells us that she had it just a half an hour ago,"
520,INDEX,An' now she cannot find it though she's hunted high and low;
521,INDEX,"She's searched the kitchen cupboard an' the bureau drawers upstairs,"
522,INDEX,An' it's not behind the sofa nor beneath the parlor chairs.
523,INDEX,"She makes us kids get busy searching every little nook,"
524,INDEX,An' this time says she's certain that she's lost her pocketbook.
525,INDEX,
526,INDEX,"She calls Pa at the office an' he laughs I guess, for then"
527,INDEX,She always mumbles something 'bout the heartlessness of men.
528,INDEX,"She calls to mind a peddler who came to the kitchen door,"
529,INDEX,An' she's certain from his whiskers an' the shabby clothes he wore
530,INDEX,"An' his dirty shirt an' collar that he must have been a crook,"
531,INDEX,An' she's positive that feller came and got her pocketbook.
532,INDEX,
533,INDEX,"But at last she allus finds it in some queer an' funny spot,"
534,INDEX,"Where she'd put it in a hurry, an' had somehow clean forgot;"
535,INDEX,"An' she heaves a sigh of gladness, an' she says, ""Well, I declare,"
536,INDEX,"I would take an oath this minute that I never put it there."""
537,INDEX,An' we're peaceable an' quiet till next time Ma goes to look
538,INDEX,An' finds she can't remember where she put her pocketbook.

543,INDEX,The Doctor
544,INDEX,
545,INDEX,
546,INDEX,"I don't see why Pa likes him so,"
547,INDEX,And seems so glad to have him come;
548,INDEX,He jabs my ribs and wants to know
549,INDEX,If here and there it's hurting some.
550,INDEX,"He holds my wrist, coz there are things"
551,INDEX,"In there, which always jump and jerk,"
552,INDEX,"Then, with a telephone he brings,"
553,INDEX,He listens to my breather work.
554,INDEX,
555,INDEX,"He taps my back and pinches me,"
556,INDEX,Then hangs a mirror on his head
557,INDEX,And looks into my throat to see
558,INDEX,What makes it hurt and if it's red.
559,INDEX,Then on his knee he starts to write
560,INDEX,"And says to mother, with a smile:"
561,INDEX,"""This ought to fix him up all right,"
562,INDEX,"We'll cure him in a little while."""
563,INDEX,
564,INDEX,I don't see why Pa likes him so.
565,INDEX,Whenever I don't want to play
566,INDEX,"He says: ""The boy is sick, I know!"
567,INDEX,"Let's get the doctor right away."""
568,INDEX,"And when he comes, he shakes his hand,"
569,INDEX,"And hustles him upstairs to me,"
570,INDEX,And seems contented just to stand
571,INDEX,Inside the room where he can see.
572,INDEX,
573,INDEX,Then Pa says every time he goes:
574,INDEX,"""That's money I am glad to pay;"
575,INDEX,"It's worth it, when a fellow knows"
576,INDEX,"His pal will soon be up to play."""
577,INDEX,"But maybe if my Pa were me,"
578,INDEX,"And had to take his pills and all,"
579,INDEX,He wouldn't be so glad to see
580,INDEX,The doctor come to make a call.

585,INDEX,Lines For a Flag Raising Ceremony
586,INDEX,
587,INDEX,
588,INDEX,Full many a flag the breeze has kissed;
589,INDEX,Through ages long the morning sun
590,INDEX,Has risen o'er the early mist
591,INDEX,The flags of men to look upon.
592,INDEX,"And some were red against the sky,"
593,INDEX,"And some with colors true were gay,"
594,INDEX,"And some in shame were born to die,"
595,INDEX,For Flags of hate must pass away.
596,INDEX,"Such symbols fall as men depart,"
597,INDEX,Brief is the reign of arrant might;
598,INDEX,The vicious and the vile at heart
599,INDEX,Give way in time before the right.
600,INDEX,
601,INDEX,A flag is nothing in itself;
602,INDEX,It but reflects the lives of men;
603,INDEX,And they who lived and toiled for pelf
604,INDEX,Went out as vipers in a den.
605,INDEX,God cleans the sky from time to time
606,INDEX,"Of every tyrant flag that flies,"
607,INDEX,And every brazen badge of crime
608,INDEX,Falls to the ground and swiftly dies.
609,INDEX,Proud kings are mouldering in the dust;
610,INDEX,Proud flags of ages past are gone;
611,INDEX,Only the symbols of the just
612,INDEX,Have lived and shall keep living on.
613,INDEX,
614,INDEX,"So long as we shall serve the truth,"
615,INDEX,"So long as honor stamps us fair,"
616,INDEX,Each age shall pass unto its youth
617,INDEX,Old Glory proudly flying there!
618,INDEX,"But if we fail our splendid past,"
619,INDEX,"If we prove faithless, weak and base,"
620,INDEX,That age shall be our banner's last;
621,INDEX,A fairer flag shall take its place.
622,INDEX,This flag we fling unto the skies
623,INDEX,"Is but an emblem of our hearts,"
624,INDEX,"And when our love of freedom dies,"
625,INDEX,Our banner with our race departs.
626,INDEX,
627,INDEX,"Full many a flag the breezes kiss,"
628,INDEX,"Full many a flag the sun has known,"
629,INDEX,But none so bright and fair as this;
630,INDEX,None quite so splendid as our own!
631,INDEX,This tells the world that we are men
632,INDEX,Who cling to manhood's ways and truth;
633,INDEX,"It is our soul's great voice and pen,"
634,INDEX,"The strength of age, the guide of youth,"
635,INDEX,And it shall ever hold the sky
636,INDEX,So long as we shall keep our trust;
637,INDEX,But if our love of right shall die
638,INDEX,Our Flag shall sink into the dust.

649,INDEX,And the soldiers guard the stairs.
650,INDEX,Let me step in a house where the tiny cart
651,INDEX,"With the horses rules the floor,"
652,INDEX,"And rest comes into my weary heart,"
653,INDEX,For I am at home once more.
654,INDEX,
655,INDEX,"Give me the house with the toys about,"
656,INDEX,"With the battered old train of cars,"
657,INDEX,"The box of paints and the books left out,"
658,INDEX,And the ship with her broken spars.
659,INDEX,Let me step in a house at the close of day
660,INDEX,"That is littered with children's toys,"
661,INDEX,"And dwell once more in the haunts of play,"
662,INDEX,With the echoes of by-gone noise.
663,INDEX,
664,INDEX,"Give me the house where the toys are seen,"
665,INDEX,"The house where the children romp,"
666,INDEX,And I'll happier be than man has been
667,INDEX,'Neath the gilded dome of pomp.
668,INDEX,Let me see the litter of bright-eyed play
669,INDEX,"Strewn over the parlor floor,"
670,INDEX,And the joys I knew in a far-off day
671,INDEX,Will gladden my heart once more.
672,INDEX,
673,INDEX,"Whoever has lived in a toy-strewn home,"
674,INDEX,"Though feeble he be and gray,"
675,INDEX,"Will yearn, no matter how far he roam,"
676,INDEX,For the glorious disarray
677,INDEX,Of the little home with its littered floor
678,INDEX,That was his in the by-gone days;
679,INDEX,"And his heart will throb as it throbbed before,"
680,INDEX,When he rests where a baby plays.

689,INDEX,How far a word of kindness goes;
690,INDEX,One never sees
691,INDEX,How far a smile of friendship flees.
692,INDEX,"Down, through the years,"
693,INDEX,The deed forgotten reappears.
694,INDEX,
695,INDEX,One kindly word
696,INDEX,The souls of many here has stirred.
697,INDEX,Man goes his way
698,INDEX,"And tells with every passing day,"
699,INDEX,Until life's end:
700,INDEX,"""Once unto me he played the friend."""
701,INDEX,
702,INDEX,We cannot say
703,INDEX,What lips are praising us to-day.
704,INDEX,We cannot tell

716,INDEX,That's where I long to be;
717,INDEX,"There are all of the glorious things,"
718,INDEX,Meaning so much to me.
719,INDEX,There is where striving and toiling ends;
720,INDEX,There is where always the rainbow bends.
721,INDEX,
722,INDEX,"Under the roof where the children shout,"
723,INDEX,There is the perfect rest;
724,INDEX,"There is the clamor of greed shut out,"
725,INDEX,Ended the ceaseless quest.
726,INDEX,Battles I fight through the heat of to-day
727,INDEX,Are only to add to their hours of play.
728,INDEX,
729,INDEX,"Under the roof where the eyes are bright,"
730,INDEX,There I would build my fame;
731,INDEX,There my record of life I'd write;
732,INDEX,There I would sign my name.
733,INDEX,There in laughter and true content
734,INDEX,Let me fashion my monument.
735,INDEX,
736,INDEX,"Under the roof where the hearts are true,"

752,INDEX,"Romance is old, but it is lovely still."
753,INDEX,"Not he who shows his love deserves the jeer,"
754,INDEX,But he who speaks not what she longs to hear.
755,INDEX,
756,INDEX,There is no shame in love's devoted speech;
757,INDEX,Man need not blush his tenderness to show;
758,INDEX,"'Tis shame to love and never let her know,"
759,INDEX,To keep his heart forever out of reach.
760,INDEX,"Not he the fool who lets his love go on,"
761,INDEX,But he who spurns it when his love is won.
762,INDEX,
763,INDEX,"Men proudly vaunt their love of gold and fame,"
764,INDEX,"High station and accomplishments of skill,"
765,INDEX,"Yet of life's greatest conquest they are still,"
766,INDEX,"And deem it weakness, or an act of shame,"
767,INDEX,To seem to place high value on the love
768,INDEX,Which first of all they should be proudest of.
769,INDEX,
770,INDEX,Let loose the sails of love and let them take
771,INDEX,The tender breezes till the day be spent;
772,INDEX,Only the fool chokes out life's sentiment.

786,INDEX,Then the first thing that I knew
787,INDEX,"It was all swelled up, an' Pa"
788,INDEX,"Said: ""There's no use fussin', Ma,"
789,INDEX,Jes' put on his coat an' hat;
790,INDEX,"Doctor Johnson must see that."""
791,INDEX,
792,INDEX,"I was scared an' yelled, because"
793,INDEX,One time when the doctor was
794,INDEX,At our house he made me smell
795,INDEX,"Something funny, an' I fell"
796,INDEX,"Fast asleep, an' when I woke"
797,INDEX,Seemed like I was goin' t' choke;
798,INDEX,An' the folks who stood about
799,INDEX,Said I'd had my tonsils out.
800,INDEX,
801,INDEX,An' my throat felt awful sore
802,INDEX,"An' I couldn't eat no more,"
803,INDEX,"An' it hurt me when I'd talk,"
804,INDEX,An' they wouldn't let me walk.
805,INDEX,So when Pa said I must go
806,INDEX,"To the doctor's, I said: ""No,"
807,INDEX,"I don't want to go to-night,"
808,INDEX,"'Cause my hand will be all right."""
809,INDEX,
810,INDEX,"Pa said: ""Take him, Ma,"" an' so"
811,INDEX,I jes' knew I had t' go.
812,INDEX,An' the doctor looked an' said:
813,INDEX,"""It is very sore an' red--"
814,INDEX,Much too sore to touch at all.
815,INDEX,"See that picture on the wall,"
816,INDEX,"That one over yonder, Bud,"
817,INDEX,With the old cow in the mud?
818,INDEX,
819,INDEX,"""Once I owned a cow like that,"
820,INDEX,"Jes' as brown an' big an' fat,"
821,INDEX,An' one day I pulled her tail
822,INDEX,An' she kicked an' knocked the pail
823,INDEX,"Full o' milk clean over me."""
824,INDEX,Then I looked up there t' see
825,INDEX,"His old cow above the couch,"

828,INDEX,"""Bud,"" says he, ""what's wrong with you;"
829,INDEX,"Did the old cow kick you, too?"""
830,INDEX,"An' he laughed, an' Ma said: ""Son,"
831,INDEX,"Never mind, now, it's all done."""
832,INDEX,Pretty soon we came away

843,INDEX,I'd like to think when life is done
844,INDEX,"That I had filled a needed post,"
845,INDEX,That here and there I'd paid my fare
846,INDEX,With more than idle talk and boast;
847,INDEX,"That I had taken gifts divine,"
848,INDEX,"The breath of life and manhood fine,"
849,INDEX,And tried to use them now and then
850,INDEX,In service for my fellow men.
851,INDEX,
852,INDEX,I'd hate to think when life is through
853,INDEX,That I had lived my round of years
854,INDEX,"A useless kind, that leaves behind"
855,INDEX,No record in this vale of tears;
856,INDEX,That I had wasted all my days
857,INDEX,"By treading only selfish ways,"
858,INDEX,And that this world would be the same
859,INDEX,If it had never known my name.
860,INDEX,
861,INDEX,"I'd like to think that here and there,"
862,INDEX,"When I am gone, there shall remain"
863,INDEX,A happier spot that might have not
864,INDEX,Existed had I toiled for gain;
865,INDEX,That some one's cheery voice and smile
866,INDEX,Shall prove that I had been worth while;
867,INDEX,That I had paid with something fine

878,INDEX,"That ""maybe it couldn't,"" but he would be one"
879,INDEX,Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.
880,INDEX,So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin
881,INDEX,On his face. If he worried he hid it.
882,INDEX,He started to sing as he tackled the thing
883,INDEX,"That couldn't be done, and he did it."
884,INDEX,
885,INDEX,"Somebody scoffed: ""Oh, you'll never do that;"
886,INDEX,"At least no one ever has done it"";"
887,INDEX,"But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,"
888,INDEX,And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.
889,INDEX,"With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,"
890,INDEX,"Without any doubting or quiddit,"
891,INDEX,He started to sing as he tackled the thing
892,INDEX,"That couldn't be done, and he did it."
893,INDEX,
894,INDEX,"There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,"
895,INDEX,There are thousands to prophesy failure;
896,INDEX,"There are thousands to point out to you one by one,"
897,INDEX,The dangers that wait to assail you.
898,INDEX,"But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,"
899,INDEX,Just take off your coat and go to it;
900,INDEX,Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing

912,INDEX,them here
913,INDEX,To use their talents day by day the dreary lives o' men to cheer.

923,INDEX,By usin' every day the gifts God gave us when He sent us here.
924,INDEX,
925,INDEX,"Why should we keep our talents hid, or think we favor men because"
926,INDEX,"We use the gifts that God has given? The robins never ask applause,"
927,INDEX,"Nor count themselves remarkable, nor strut in a superior way,"
928,INDEX,Because their music sweeter is than that God gave unto the jay.
929,INDEX,"Only a man conceited grows as he makes use of talents fine,"
930,INDEX,Forgetting that he merely does the working of the Will Divine.
931,INDEX,
932,INDEX,"Lord, as the robins, let me serve! Teach me to do the best I can"
933,INDEX,"To make this world a better place, an' happier for my fellow man."
934,INDEX,If gift o' mine can cheer his soul an' hearten him along his way
935,INDEX,Let me not keep that talent hid; I would make use of it to-day.

1000,INDEX,"Oh, the suff'rin, I had was most dreadful t' bear!"
1001,INDEX,"I'm sorry, my dear, but I can't tell ye where."

1007,INDEX,"But the best I can say is that one tooth is gone,"
1008,INDEX,The censor won't let me inform ye which one.
1009,INDEX,"I met a young fellow who knows ye right well,"
1010,INDEX,"An' ye know him, too, but his name I can't tell."

1037,INDEX,
1038,INDEX,"These friends, unseen, unheard, unknown,"

1040,INDEX,They serve us in a thousand ways
1041,INDEX,Where we perhaps should friendless be;

1103,INDEX,Adjusted with a smile.

1108,INDEX,He cannot keep his self-control
1109,INDEX,When with a shovel full of coal
1110,INDEX,"He misses where it's headed for,"
1111,INDEX,And hits the furnace door.
1112,INDEX,
1113,INDEX,He measures with a careful eye
1114,INDEX,"The space for which he's soon to try,"
1115,INDEX,Then grabs his trusty shovel up
1116,INDEX,"And loads it in the bin,"
1117,INDEX,"Then turns and with a healthy lunge,"
1118,INDEX,"That's two parts swing and two parts plunge,"
1119,INDEX,"He lets go at the furnace fire,"
1120,INDEX,Convinced it will go in!
1121,INDEX,"And then we hear a sudden smack,"
1122,INDEX,The cellar air turns blue and black;
1123,INDEX,Above the rattle of the coal
1124,INDEX,We hear his awful roar.
1125,INDEX,From dreadful language upward hissed
1126,INDEX,"We know that father's aim has missed,"
1127,INDEX,And that his shovel full of coal

1768,INDEX,"Becoz I saw a piece of wood 'at's stickin' out all painted red."""
1769,INDEX,"""If mother knew,"" I said to him, ""you'd get a licking, I'll be bound,"
1770,INDEX,"But just clear out of here at once, and don't you ever snoop around."""
1771,INDEX,
1772,INDEX,"And as he scampered down the stairs I stood and chuckled to myself,"
1773,INDEX,As I remembered how I'd oft explored the topmost closet shelf.
1774,INDEX,It all came back again to me--with what a shrewd and cunning way
1775,INDEX,"I, too, had often sought to solve the mysteries of Christmas Day."
1776,INDEX,"How many times my daddy, too, had come upstairs without a sound"
1777,INDEX,"And caught me, just as I'd begun my clever scheme to snoop around."
1778,INDEX,
1779,INDEX,"And oh, I envied him his plight; I envied him the joy he feels"
1780,INDEX,Who knows that every drawer that's locked some treasure dear to him
1781,INDEX,conceals;
1782,INDEX,I envied him his Christmas fun and wished that it again were mine
1783,INDEX,To seek to solve the mysteries by paper wrapped and bound by twine.
1784,INDEX,"Some day he'll come to understand that all the time I stood and frowned,"
1785,INDEX,I saw a boy of years ago who also used to snoop around.

1848,INDEX,Sometimes they tie you down to tears
1849,INDEX,"And then repay you with a smile,"

1851,INDEX,"They tie you fast to chubby feet,"
1852,INDEX,And cheeks of pink and kisses sweet.

1854,INDEX,"""They fasten you with cords of love"

1919,INDEX,
1920,INDEX,"Before you came, my little lad,"
1921,INDEX,I used to think that I was good;
1922,INDEX,"Some vicious habits, too, I had,"
1923,INDEX,But wouldn't change them if I could.
1924,INDEX,I held my head up high and said:
1925,INDEX,"""I'm all that I have need to be,"
1926,INDEX,"It matters not what path I tread--"""
1927,INDEX,But that was ere you came to me.
1928,INDEX,
1929,INDEX,"I treated lightly sacred things,"
1930,INDEX,And went my way in search of fun;
1931,INDEX,"Upon myself I kept no strings,"
1932,INDEX,And gave no heed to folly done.
1933,INDEX,I gave myself up to the fight
1934,INDEX,"For worldly wealth and earthly fame,"
1935,INDEX,"And sought advantage, wrong or right--"
1936,INDEX,But that was long before you came.
1937,INDEX,
1938,INDEX,"But now you sit across from me,"
1939,INDEX,"Your big brown eyes are opened wide,"
1940,INDEX,"And every deed I do you see,"
1941,INDEX,"And, O, I dare not step aside."
1942,INDEX,"I've shaken loose from habits bad,"
1943,INDEX,"And what is wrong I've come to dread,"
1944,INDEX,"Because I know, my little lad,"
1945,INDEX,That you will follow where I tread.
1946,INDEX,
1947,INDEX,I want those eyes to glow with pride;
1948,INDEX,"In me I want those eyes to see,"
1949,INDEX,"The while we wander side by side,"
1950,INDEX,The sort of man I'd have you be.
1951,INDEX,And so I'm striving to be good
1952,INDEX,"With all my might, that you may know,"
1953,INDEX,"When this great world is understood,"
1954,INDEX,What pleasures are worth while below.
1955,INDEX,
1956,INDEX,I see life in a different light
1957,INDEX,From what I did before you came;
1958,INDEX,Then anything that pleased seemed right--
1959,INDEX,"But you are here to bear my name,"
1960,INDEX,And you are looking up to me
1961,INDEX,"With those big eyes from day to day,"

1969,INDEX,
1970,INDEX,
1971,INDEX,"Sure, they get stubborn at times; they worry and"
1972,INDEX,"fret us a lot,"
1973,INDEX,But I'd rather be crossed by a glad little boy
1974,INDEX,and frequently worried than not.
1975,INDEX,There are hours when they get on my nerves
1976,INDEX,"and set my poor brain all awhirl,"
1977,INDEX,But I'd rather be troubled that way than to be
1978,INDEX,the man who has no little girl.
1979,INDEX,
1980,INDEX,"There are times they're a nuisance, that's true,"
1981,INDEX,"with all of their racket and noise,"
1982,INDEX,But I'd rather my personal pleasures be lost than
1983,INDEX,to give up my girls and my boys.
1984,INDEX,Not always they're perfectly good; there are
1985,INDEX,"times when they're wilfully bad,"
1986,INDEX,But I'd rather be worried by youngsters of mine
1987,INDEX,than lonely and childless and sad.
1988,INDEX,
1989,INDEX,So I try to be patient and calm whenever they're
1990,INDEX,having their fling;
1991,INDEX,For the sum of their laughter and love is more
1992,INDEX,than the worry they bring.
1993,INDEX,And each night when sweet peace settles down
1994,INDEX,"and I see them asleep in their cot,"
1995,INDEX,"I chuckle and say: ""They upset me to-day, but"

2006,INDEX,He tells us children every day
2007,INDEX,Just what should now be done.
2008,INDEX,"He knows the way to fix the trusts,"
2009,INDEX,He has a simple plan;
2010,INDEX,But if the furnace needs repairs
2011,INDEX,We have to hire a man.
2012,INDEX,
2013,INDEX,"My father, in a day or two,"
2014,INDEX,Could land big thieves in jail;
2015,INDEX,"There's nothing that he cannot do,"
2016,INDEX,"He knows no word like ""fail."""
2017,INDEX,"""Our confidence"" he would restore,"
2018,INDEX,Of that there is no doubt;
2019,INDEX,But if there is a chair to mend
2020,INDEX,We have to send it out.
2021,INDEX,
2022,INDEX,All public questions that arise
2023,INDEX,He settles on the spot;
2024,INDEX,"He waits not till the tumult dies,"
2025,INDEX,But grabs it while it's hot.
2026,INDEX,In matters of finance he can
2027,INDEX,Tell Congress what to do;
2028,INDEX,"But, O, he finds it hard to meet"
2029,INDEX,His bills as they fall due.
2030,INDEX,
2031,INDEX,It almost makes him sick to read
2032,INDEX,The things law-makers say;
2033,INDEX,"Why, father's just the man they need;"
2034,INDEX,He never goes astray.
2035,INDEX,"All wars he'd very quickly end,"
2036,INDEX,As fast as I can write it;
2037,INDEX,But when a neighbor starts a fuss
2038,INDEX,'Tis mother has to fight it.
2039,INDEX,
2040,INDEX,In conversation father can
2041,INDEX,Do many wondrous things;
2042,INDEX,He's built upon a wiser plan
2043,INDEX,Than presidents or kings.
2044,INDEX,He knows the ins and outs of each
2045,INDEX,And every deep transaction;
2046,INDEX,"We look to him for theories,"

2059,INDEX,All the joys the soul has treasured--
2060,INDEX,"Glad to be where smiles aren't measured,"
2061,INDEX,Where I've blended with the gladness
2062,INDEX,"All the heart has known of sadness,"
2063,INDEX,Where some long-familiar steeple
2064,INDEX,Marks my town of friendly people.
2065,INDEX,
2066,INDEX,Though it's fun to go a-straying
2067,INDEX,Where the bands are nightly playing
2068,INDEX,And the throngs of men and women
2069,INDEX,"Drain the cup of pleasure brimmin',"
2070,INDEX,I am glad when it is over
2071,INDEX,That I've ceased to play the Rover.
2072,INDEX,And when once the train starts chugging
2073,INDEX,"Towards the children I'd be hugging,"
2074,INDEX,All my thoughts and dreams are set there;
2075,INDEX,Fast enough I cannot get there.
2076,INDEX,
2077,INDEX,"Guess I wasn't meant for bright lights,"
2078,INDEX,"For the blaze of red and white lights,"
2079,INDEX,For the throngs that seems to smother
2080,INDEX,"In their selfishness, each other;"
2081,INDEX,"For whenever I've been down there,"
2082,INDEX,"Tramped the noisy, blatant town there,"
2083,INDEX,Always in a week I've started
2084,INDEX,"Yearning, hungering, heavy-hearted,"
2085,INDEX,For the home town and its spaces
2086,INDEX,Lit by fine and friendly faces.
2087,INDEX,
2088,INDEX,Like to be where men about me
2089,INDEX,Do not look on me to doubt me;
2090,INDEX,"Where I know the men and women,"
2091,INDEX,"Know why tears some eyes are dimmin',"
2092,INDEX,Know the good folks an' the bad folks
2093,INDEX,An' the glad folks an' the sad folks;
2094,INDEX,"Where we live with one another,"
2095,INDEX,Meanin' something to each other.

2102,INDEX,The Dead Return
2103,INDEX,
2104,INDEX,
2105,INDEX,The dead return. I know they do;
2106,INDEX,"The glad smile may have passed from view,"
2107,INDEX,The ringing voice that cheered us so
2108,INDEX,In that remembered long ago
2109,INDEX,"Be stilled, and yet in sweeter ways"
2110,INDEX,It speaks to us throughout our days.
2111,INDEX,The kindly father comes again
2112,INDEX,"To guide us through the haunts of men,"
2113,INDEX,"And always near, their sons to greet"
2114,INDEX,Are lingering the mothers sweet.
2115,INDEX,
2116,INDEX,About us wheresoe'er we tread
2117,INDEX,Hover the spirits of our dead;
2118,INDEX,We cannot see them as we could
2119,INDEX,"In bygone days, when near they stood"
2120,INDEX,"And shared the joys and griefs that came,"
2121,INDEX,But they are with us just the same.
2122,INDEX,"They see us as we plod along,"
2123,INDEX,"And proudly smile when we are strong,"
2124,INDEX,And sigh and grieve the self-same way
2125,INDEX,When thoughtlessly we go astray.
2126,INDEX,
2127,INDEX,I sometimes think it hurts the dead
2128,INDEX,"When into sin and shame we're led,"
2129,INDEX,And that they feel a thrill divine
2130,INDEX,When we've accomplished something fine.
2131,INDEX,And sometimes thoughts that come at night
2132,INDEX,Seem more like messages that might
2133,INDEX,"Have whispered been by one we love,"
2134,INDEX,Whose spirit has been called above.
2135,INDEX,"So wise the counsel, it must be"
2136,INDEX,That all we are the dead can see.
2137,INDEX,
2138,INDEX,The dead return. They come to share
2139,INDEX,Our laughter and our bit of care;
2140,INDEX,"They glory, as they used to do,"
2141,INDEX,"When we are splendid men and true,"
2142,INDEX,"In all the joy that we have won,"
2143,INDEX,And they are proud of what we've done.
2144,INDEX,They suffer when we suffer woe;
2145,INDEX,All things about us here they know.
2146,INDEX,And though we never see them here
2147,INDEX,Their spirits hover very near.

2157,INDEX,"And then before an open fire he smokes his pipe, while in the blaze"
2158,INDEX,He seems to see a picture show of all his happy yesterdays.
2159,INDEX,"No ordinary film is that which memory throws upon the screen,"
2160,INDEX,But one in which his hidden soul comes out and can be plainly seen.
2161,INDEX,
2162,INDEX,"Now, I've been dreaming by the grate. I've seen myself the way I am,"
2163,INDEX,Stripped bare of affectation's garb and wisdom's pose and folly's sham.
2164,INDEX,"I've seen my soul and talked with it, and learned some things I never"
2165,INDEX,knew.
2166,INDEX,"I walk about the world as one, but I express the wish of two."
2167,INDEX,"I've come to see the soul of me is wiser than my selfish mind,"

2169,INDEX,
2170,INDEX,"I should have sold myself for gold when I was young long years ago,"
2171,INDEX,"But for my soul which whispered then: ""You love your home and garden so,"
2172,INDEX,You never could be quite content in palace walls. Once rise to fame
2173,INDEX,And you will lose the gentler joys which now so eagerly you claim.
2174,INDEX,"I want to walk these lanes with you and keep the comradeship of trees,"
2175,INDEX,"Let you and I be happy here, nor seek life's gaudy luxuries."""
2176,INDEX,
2177,INDEX,"Mine is a curious soul, I guess; it seemed so, smiling in my dreams;"
2178,INDEX,It keeps me close to little folks and birds and flowers and running
2179,INDEX,"streams,"
2180,INDEX,"To Mother and her friends and mine; and though no fortune we possess,"
2181,INDEX,The years that we have lived and loved have all been rich with happiness.
2182,INDEX,"I'm glad the snowdrifts shut me in, for I have had a chance to see"
2183,INDEX,How fortunate I've been to have that sort of soul to counsel me.

2193,INDEX,An aunt to come a visitin' or one to go and see
2194,INDEX,Is just about the finest kind of lady there could be.
2195,INDEX,"Of course she's not your mother, an' she hasn't got her ways,"
2196,INDEX,But a part that's most important in a feller's life she plays.
2197,INDEX,
2198,INDEX,"She is kind an' she is gentle, an' sometimes she's full of fun,"
2199,INDEX,An' she's very sympathetic when some dreadful thing you've done.
2200,INDEX,"An' she likes to buy you candy, an' she's always gettin' toys"
2201,INDEX,"That you wish your Pa would get you, for she hasn't any boys."
2202,INDEX,"But sometimes she's over-loving, an' your cheeks turn red with shame"
2203,INDEX,"When she smothers you with kisses, but you like her just the same."
2204,INDEX,
2205,INDEX,"One time my father took me to my aunty's, an' he said:"
2206,INDEX,"""You will stay here till I get you, an' be sure you go to bed"

2209,INDEX,"I did as I was told to, an' when Pa came back for me"
2210,INDEX,He said there was a baby at the house for me to see.
2211,INDEX,
2212,INDEX,"I've been visitin' at aunty's for a week or two, an' Pa"

2228,INDEX,An' when the kids recited them the folks would call them grand.
2229,INDEX,"If I'd been born a Whittier, instead of what I am,"
2230,INDEX,I'd write a poem now about a piece of bread an' jam.

2232,INDEX,"I'd tell how hungry children get all afternoon in school,"
2233,INDEX,"An' sittin' at attention just because it is the rule,"
2234,INDEX,An' lookin' every now an' then up to the clock to see
2235,INDEX,If that big hand an' little hand would ever get to three.
2236,INDEX,I'd tell how children hurry home an' give the door a slam
2237,INDEX,An' ask their mothers can they have a piece of bread an' jam.
2238,INDEX,
2239,INDEX,"Some poets write of things to eat an' sing of dinners fine,"
2240,INDEX,"An' praise the dishes they enjoy, an' some folks sing of wine,"
2241,INDEX,"But they've forgotten, I suppose, the days when they were small"
2242,INDEX,An' hurried home from school to get the finest food of all;
2243,INDEX,They don't remember any more how good it was to cram
2244,INDEX,Inside their hungry little selves a piece of bread an' jam.
2245,INDEX,
2246,INDEX,"I wish I was a Whittier, a Stevenson or Burns,"
2247,INDEX,"I wouldn't write of hills an' brooks, or mossy banks or ferns,"
2248,INDEX,"I wouldn't write of rolling seas or mountains towering high,"
2249,INDEX,"But I would sing of chocolate cake an' good old apple pie,"
2250,INDEX,"An' best of all the food there is, beyond the slightest doubt,"

2260,INDEX,And doff my hat as I pass her by;
2261,INDEX,"I reverence the furrows that mark her brow,"
2262,INDEX,And the sparkling love light in her eye.
2263,INDEX,"The little woman who stays at home,"
2264,INDEX,And makes no bid for the world's applause;
2265,INDEX,"Who never sighs for a chance to roam,"
2266,INDEX,But toils all day in a grander cause.
2267,INDEX,
2268,INDEX,"The little woman, who seems so weak,"
2269,INDEX,Yet bears her burdens day by day;
2270,INDEX,And no one has ever heard her speak
2271,INDEX,In a bitter or loud complaining way.
2272,INDEX,"She sings a snatch of a merry song,"
2273,INDEX,As she toils in her home from morn to night.
2274,INDEX,Her work is hard and the hours are long
2275,INDEX,But the little woman's heart is light.
2276,INDEX,
2277,INDEX,"A slave to love is that woman small,"
2278,INDEX,"And yearly her burdens heavier grow,"
2279,INDEX,"But somehow she seems to bear them all,"

2281,INDEX,"Her children all have a mother's care,"
2282,INDEX,Her home the touch of a good wife knows;
2283,INDEX,"No burden's too heavy for her to bear,"
2284,INDEX,"But, patiently doing her best, she goes."
2285,INDEX,
2286,INDEX,"The little woman, may God be kind"
2287,INDEX,To her wherever she dwells to-day;
2288,INDEX,The little woman who seems to find
2289,INDEX,Her joy in toiling along life's way.
2290,INDEX,May God bring peace to her work-worn breast
2291,INDEX,And joy to her mother-heart at last;
2292,INDEX,"May love be hers when it's time to rest,"
2293,INDEX,And the roughest part of the road is passed.
2294,INDEX,
2295,INDEX,The little woman--how oft it seems
2296,INDEX,God chooses her for the mother's part;
2297,INDEX,And many a grown-up sits and dreams
2298,INDEX,To-day of her with an aching heart.
2299,INDEX,For he knows well how she toiled for him
2300,INDEX,And he sees it now that it is too late;

2312,INDEX,"An' every bush with roses clad,"
2313,INDEX,"An' nature in her finest suit,"
2314,INDEX,An' all things as they used to be
2315,INDEX,In days before the war came on.
2316,INDEX,"Yet time has changed both him an' me,"
2317,INDEX,"An' I am here, but he is gone."
2318,INDEX,
2319,INDEX,The orchard's as it was back then
2320,INDEX,When he was just a little tyke;
2321,INDEX,The lake's as calm an' fair as when
2322,INDEX,We used to go to fish for pike.
2323,INDEX,There's nothing different I can see
2324,INDEX,"That God has made about the place,"
2325,INDEX,"Except the change in him an' me,"
2326,INDEX,An' that is difficult to trace.
2327,INDEX,
2328,INDEX,I only know one day he came
2329,INDEX,An' found me in the barn alone.
2330,INDEX,"To some he might have looked the same,"
2331,INDEX,But he was not the lad I'd known.
2332,INDEX,"His soul, it seemed, had heard the call"
2333,INDEX,As plainly as a mortal can.
2334,INDEX,"Before he spoke to me at all,"
2335,INDEX,I saw my boy become a man.
2336,INDEX,
2337,INDEX,I can't explain just what occurred;
2338,INDEX,I sat an' talked about it there;
2339,INDEX,"The dinner-bell I never heard,"
2340,INDEX,"Or if I did, I didn't care."
2341,INDEX,But suddenly it seemed to me
2342,INDEX,"Out of the dark there came a light,"
2343,INDEX,An' in a new way I could see
2344,INDEX,That I was wrong an' he was right.
2345,INDEX,
2346,INDEX,I can't help thinkin' o' the lad!
2347,INDEX,"He's fightin' hate an' greed an' lust,"
2348,INDEX,"An' here am I, his doting dad,"
2349,INDEX,Believin' in a purpose just.
2350,INDEX,"Time was I talked the joy o' play,"
2351,INDEX,But now life's goal is all I see;
2352,INDEX,The petty thoughts I've put away--

2359,INDEX,
2360,INDEX,
2361,INDEX,When mother baked an angel cake we kids would gather round
2362,INDEX,"An' watch her gentle hands at work, an' never make a sound;"
2363,INDEX,"We'd watch her stir the eggs an' flour an' powdered sugar, too,"
2364,INDEX,"An' pour it in the crinkled tin, an' then when it was through"
2365,INDEX,"She'd spread the icing over it, an' we knew very soon"
2366,INDEX,"That one would get the plate to lick, an' one would get the spoon."
2367,INDEX,
2368,INDEX,"It seemed no matter where we were those mornings at our play,"
2369,INDEX,"Upstairs or out of doors somewhere, we all knew right away"
2370,INDEX,"When Ma was in the kitchen, an' was gettin' out the tin"
2371,INDEX,"An' things to make an angel cake, an' so we scampered in."
2372,INDEX,"An' Ma would smile at us an' say: ""Now you keep still an' wait"
2373,INDEX,"An' when I'm through I'll let you lick the spoon an' icing plate."""
2374,INDEX,
2375,INDEX,"We watched her kneel beside the stove, an' put her arm so white"
2376,INDEX,Inside the oven just to find if it was heatin' right.
2377,INDEX,"An' mouths an' eyes were open then, becoz we always knew"
2378,INDEX,The time for us to get our taste was quickly comin' due.
2379,INDEX,"Then while she mixed the icing up, she'd hum a simple tune,"
2380,INDEX,"An' one of us would bar the plate, an' one would bar the spoon."
2381,INDEX,
2382,INDEX,"Could we catch a glimpse of Heaven, and some snow-white kitchen there,"
2383,INDEX,"I'm sure that we'd see mother, smiling now, and still as fair;"
2384,INDEX,And I know that gathered round her we should see an angel brood
2385,INDEX,That is watching every movement as she makes an angel food;
2386,INDEX,"For I know that little angels, as we used to do, await"
2387,INDEX,The moment when she lets them lick the icing spoon and plate.

2396,INDEX,Some have the gift of leadership and some the ways of life can teach.
2397,INDEX,And fame and wealth reward their friends; in jewels are their splendors
2398,INDEX,"told,"
2399,INDEX,But in good time their favorites grow very faint and gray and old.
2400,INDEX,But there are men who laugh at time and hold the cruel years at bay;
2401,INDEX,They romp through life forever young because they have the gift of play.
2402,INDEX,
2403,INDEX,"They walk with children, hand in hand, through daisy fields and orchards"
2404,INDEX,"fair,"
2405,INDEX,Nor all the dignity of age and power and pomp can follow there;
2406,INDEX,"They've kept the magic charm of youth beneath the wrinkled robe of Time,"
2407,INDEX,And there's no friendly apple tree that they have grown too old to climb.
2408,INDEX,They have not let their boyhood die; they can be children for the day;
2409,INDEX,"They have not bartered for success and all its praise, the gift of play."
2410,INDEX,
2411,INDEX,They think and talk in terms of youth; with love of life their eyes are
2412,INDEX,bright;
2413,INDEX,No rheumatism of the soul has robbed them of the world's delight;
2414,INDEX,"They laugh and sing their way along and join in pleasures when they can,"
2415,INDEX,And in their glad philosophy they hold that mirth becomes a man.
2416,INDEX,They spend no strength in growing old. What if their brows be crowned
2417,INDEX,with gray?
2418,INDEX,The spirits in their breasts are young. They still possess the gift of
2419,INDEX,play.
2420,INDEX,
2421,INDEX,The richest men of life are not the ones who rise to wealth and fame--
2422,INDEX,"Not the great sages, old and wise, and grave of face and bent of frame,"
2423,INDEX,"But the glad spirits, tall and straight, who 'spite of time and all its"
2424,INDEX,"care,"
2425,INDEX,Have kept the power to laugh and sing and in youth's fellowship to share.
2426,INDEX,"They that can walk with boys and be a boy among them, blithe and gay,"

2433,INDEX,
2434,INDEX,
2435,INDEX,You can learn a lot from boys
2436,INDEX,By the way they use their toys;
2437,INDEX,"Some are selfish in their care,"
2438,INDEX,Never very glad to share
2439,INDEX,Playthings with another boy;
2440,INDEX,Seem to want to hoard their joy.
2441,INDEX,And they hide away the drum
2442,INDEX,For the days that never come;
2443,INDEX,"Hide the train of cars and skates,"
2444,INDEX,"Keeping them from all their mates,"
2445,INDEX,And run all their boyhood through
2446,INDEX,With their toys as good as new.
2447,INDEX,
2448,INDEX,"Others gladly give and lend,"
2449,INDEX,"Heedless that the tin may bend,"
2450,INDEX,"Caring not that drum-heads break,"
2451,INDEX,Minding not that playmates take
2452,INDEX,To themselves the joy that lies
2453,INDEX,In the little birthday prize.
2454,INDEX,And in homes that house such boys
2455,INDEX,"Always there are broken toys,"
2456,INDEX,Symbolizing moments glad
2457,INDEX,That the youthful lives have had.
2458,INDEX,There you'll never find a shelf
2459,INDEX,Dedicated unto self.
2460,INDEX,
2461,INDEX,"Toys are made for children's fun,"
2462,INDEX,"Very frail and quickly done,"
2463,INDEX,"And who keeps them long to view,"
2464,INDEX,"Bright of paint and good as new,"
2465,INDEX,Robs himself and other boys
2466,INDEX,Of their swiftly passing joys.
2467,INDEX,So he looked upon a toy
2468,INDEX,When our soldier was a boy;
2469,INDEX,And somehow to-day we're glad
2470,INDEX,That the tokens of our lad
2471,INDEX,And the trinkets that we keep
2472,INDEX,"Are a broken, battered heap."
2473,INDEX,
2474,INDEX,Life itself is but a toy
2475,INDEX,Filled with duty and with joy;
2476,INDEX,Not too closely should we guard
2477,INDEX,Our brief time from being scarred;
2478,INDEX,Never high on musty shelves
2479,INDEX,Should we hoard it for ourselves.
2480,INDEX,It is something we should share
2481,INDEX,In another's hour of care--
2482,INDEX,Something we should gladly give
2483,INDEX,That another here may live;
2484,INDEX,We should never live it through
2485,INDEX,Keeping it as good as new.

2496,INDEX,The parcels hidden all about.
2497,INDEX,"Within a corner, gaunt to see,"
2498,INDEX,"There stands a barren Christmas tree,"
2499,INDEX,But soon upon its branches green
2500,INDEX,A burst of splendor will be seen.
2501,INDEX,"And when the busy tongues grow still,"
2502,INDEX,That now are wagging with a will
2503,INDEX,"Above me as I sit and rest,"
2504,INDEX,I shall be at my happiest.
2505,INDEX,The greatest joy man can receive
2506,INDEX,Is being Dad on Christmas eve.
2507,INDEX,
2508,INDEX,Soon I shall toil with tinsel bright;
2509,INDEX,"Place here and there a colored light,"
2510,INDEX,And wheresoe'er my fingers lie
2511,INDEX,To-morrow shall a youngster spy
2512,INDEX,"Some wonder gift or magic toy,"

2514,INDEX,The stockings on the mantle piece
2515,INDEX,"I'll bulge with sweets, till every crease"
2516,INDEX,That marks them now is stretched away.
2517,INDEX,There will be horns and drums to play
2518,INDEX,And dolls to love. For it's my task
2519,INDEX,To get for them the joys they ask.
2520,INDEX,What greater charm can fortune weave
2521,INDEX,Than being Dad on Christmas eve?
2522,INDEX,
2523,INDEX,"With all their pomp, great monarchs miss"
2524,INDEX,The happiness of scenes like this.
2525,INDEX,"Rich halls to-night are still and sad,"
2526,INDEX,Because no little girl or lad
2527,INDEX,Shall wake upon the morn to find
2528,INDEX,The joys that love has left behind.
2529,INDEX,"Oh, I have had my share of woe--"
2530,INDEX,Known what it is to bear a blow--
2531,INDEX,Shed sorrow's tears and stood to care
2532,INDEX,"When life seemed desolate and bare,"
2533,INDEX,Yet here to-night I smile and say
2534,INDEX,Worth while was all that came my way.

2546,INDEX,"He made them strong for climbing trees, he suited them for horns and"
2547,INDEX,"drums,"
2548,INDEX,And filled them full of revelries so they could be their father's chums.
2549,INDEX,But then He saw that gentle ways must also travel from above.
2550,INDEX,"And so, through all our troubled days He sent us little girls to love."
2551,INDEX,
2552,INDEX,"He knew that earth would never do, unless a bit of Heaven it had."
2553,INDEX,Men needed eyes divinely blue to toil by day and still be glad.
2554,INDEX,"A world where only men and boys made merry would in time grow stale,"
2555,INDEX,And so He shared His Heavenly joys that faith in Him should never fail.
2556,INDEX,"He sent us down a thousand charms, He decked our ways with golden curls"
2557,INDEX,And laughing eyes and dimpled arms. He let us have His little girls.
2558,INDEX,
2559,INDEX,"They are the tenderest of His flowers, the little angels of His flock,"
2560,INDEX,"And we may keep and call them ours, until God's messenger shall knock."
2561,INDEX,They bring to us the gentleness and beauty that we sorely need;
2562,INDEX,They soothe us with each fond caress and strengthen us for every deed.

2687,INDEX,"all with the dust are choking,"
2688,INDEX,"He dances there with a spirit gay,"
2689,INDEX,"And tints with gold what is drab and gray,"
2690,INDEX,And into the gloom of the night and day
2691,INDEX,He scatters his mirthful joking.
2692,INDEX,
2693,INDEX,He wins to courage the soul-tried men; he lightens
2694,INDEX,their hours of sorrow;
2695,INDEX,He turns their thoughts from the grief that is to
2696,INDEX,the joy that may come to-morrow.
2697,INDEX,"He mocks at death and he jests at toil, as one"
2698,INDEX,that is never weary;

2700,INDEX,Or the muddy trench that he's standing in;

2728,INDEX,In spite of the throngs who doubt him.

2769,INDEX,"Oh, I've sipped the cup of sorrow an' I've felt the gad of trouble,"
2770,INDEX,An' I know the hurt of trudgin' through a field o'errun with stubble;
2771,INDEX,"But a rougher road to travel had my father good before me,"
2772,INDEX,An' I'm owin' all my gladness to the tasks he shouldered for me.
2773,INDEX,"Oh, I didn't understand it, when a lad I played about him,"
2774,INDEX,But he labored for my safety in the days I'd be without him.
2775,INDEX,
2776,INDEX,"Oh, my kindly father never gave himself a year of leisure--"
2777,INDEX,"Never lived one selfish moment, never turned aside for pleasure--"
2778,INDEX,Though he must have grown aweary of the burdens he was bearin';

3128,INDEX,"And the faithful from the doubtful you would pick,"
3129,INDEX,It is not a mighty task; of yourself you've but to ask:

3136,INDEX,
3137,INDEX,
3138,INDEX,"I like to get to thinking of the old days that are gone,"
3139,INDEX,"When there were joys that never more the world will look upon,"
3140,INDEX,The days before inventors smoothed the little cares away
3141,INDEX,"And made, what seemed but luxuries then, the joys of every day;"
3142,INDEX,"When bathrooms were exceptions, and we got our weekly scrub"
3143,INDEX,By standing in the middle of a little wooden tub.
3144,INDEX,
3145,INDEX,"We had no rapid heaters, and no blazing gas to burn,"
3146,INDEX,"We boiled the water on the stove, and each one took his turn."
3147,INDEX,Sometimes to save expenses we would use one tub for two;
3148,INDEX,"The water brother Billy used for me would also do,"
3149,INDEX,"Although an extra kettle I was granted, I admit,"
3150,INDEX,On winter nights to freshen and to warm it up a bit.
3151,INDEX,
3152,INDEX,"We carried water up the stairs in buckets and in pails,"
3153,INDEX,"And sometimes splashed it on our legs, and rent the air with wails,"
3154,INDEX,"But if the nights were very cold, by closing every door"
3155,INDEX,We were allowed to take our bath upon the kitchen floor.
3156,INDEX,"Beside the cheery stove we stood and gave ourselves a rub,"
3157,INDEX,In comfort most luxurious in that old wooden tub.
3158,INDEX,
3159,INDEX,"But modern homes no more go through that joyous weekly fun,"
3160,INDEX,And through the sitting rooms at night no half-dried children run;
3161,INDEX,"No little flying forms go past, too swift to see their charms,"
3162,INDEX,With shirts and underwear and things tucked underneath their arms;
3163,INDEX,"The home's so full of luxury now, it's almost like a club,"
3164,INDEX,I sometimes wish we could go back to that old wooden tub.

3173,INDEX,"""A thousand joys I'll give away;"
3174,INDEX,I'll walk among the poor I find
3175,INDEX,And unto one and all be kind.
3176,INDEX,I'll place a wreath of roses red
3177,INDEX,Upon the bier of all my dead;
3178,INDEX,I'll help the struggling youth to climb;
3179,INDEX,In doing good I'll spend my time;
3180,INDEX,To all in need I'll friendly be
3181,INDEX,"The day that fortune smiles on me."""
3182,INDEX,
3183,INDEX,He never guessed that being kind
3184,INDEX,Depends upon the heart and mind
3185,INDEX,And not upon the purse at all;
3186,INDEX,"That poor men's gifts, however small,"
3187,INDEX,Make light some weary traveler's load
3188,INDEX,And smooth for him his troubled road.
3189,INDEX,He never knew or understood
3190,INDEX,The fellowship of doing good.
3191,INDEX,Because he had not much to spare
3192,INDEX,He thought it vain to give his share.
3193,INDEX,
3194,INDEX,"Yet many passed him, day by day,"
3195,INDEX,He might have helped along the way.
3196,INDEX,He fancied kindness something which
3197,INDEX,Belongs entirely to the rich.
3198,INDEX,"And so he lived and toiled for gold,"
3199,INDEX,"Unsympathetic, harsh and cold,"
3200,INDEX,Intending all the time to share
3201,INDEX,The burdens that his brothers bear
3202,INDEX,"When he possessed great wealth, and he"
3203,INDEX,Could well afford a friend to be.
3204,INDEX,
3205,INDEX,"His fortune came, but, oh, too late;"
3206,INDEX,The poor about him could not wait.
3207,INDEX,They never guessed and never knew
3208,INDEX,The things that he had meant to do.
3209,INDEX,Few knew how much he'd planned to give
3210,INDEX,If God had only let him live.
3211,INDEX,"And when at last his form was cold,"
3212,INDEX,All that he'd left on earth was gold.
3213,INDEX,A kindly name is something which
3214,INDEX,A man must earn before he's rich.

3225,INDEX,And so I sit at home at night
3226,INDEX,And teach my children what is right
3227,INDEX,And wise for them to do;
3228,INDEX,And when I'm on the job by day
3229,INDEX,I do my best to earn my pay.
3230,INDEX,
3231,INDEX,Though arguments may rage and roar;
3232,INDEX,I grease the hinges on my door
3233,INDEX,And paint the porches blue;
3234,INDEX,"I love this splendid land of ours,"
3235,INDEX,And so I plant the seeds and flowers
3236,INDEX,And watch them bursting through.
3237,INDEX,I never stand upon a box
3238,INDEX,To say we're headed for the rocks.

3245,INDEX,And dresses well his mate;
3246,INDEX,He keeps his children warmly clad
3247,INDEX,And lets them know they have a dad.
3248,INDEX,
3249,INDEX,The nation's safe as long as men
3250,INDEX,Get to their work and back again
3251,INDEX,Each day with cheerful smile;
3252,INDEX,So long as there are fathers who
3253,INDEX,Rejoice in what they have to do

3268,INDEX,How the man had gone astray.
3269,INDEX,
3270,INDEX,Not to him the dime I gave;
3271,INDEX,"Not unto the man of woe,"
3272,INDEX,"Not to him who should be brave,"
3273,INDEX,"Not to him who'd sunk so low,"
3274,INDEX,But the boy of long ago.
3275,INDEX,
3276,INDEX,Passed his years of sin and shame
3277,INDEX,"Through the filth that all could see,"
3278,INDEX,Out of what he is there came
3279,INDEX,One more pitiful to me:
3280,INDEX,Came the boy that used to be.
3281,INDEX,
3282,INDEX,"Smiling, full of promise glad,"
3283,INDEX,"Stood a baby, like my own;"

3286,INDEX,Out of which this wreck had grown!
3287,INDEX,
3288,INDEX,"Where, thought I, must lie the blame?"
3289,INDEX,Who has failed in such a way?
3290,INDEX,"As all children come he came,"
3291,INDEX,There's a soul within his clay;
3292,INDEX,Who has led his feet astray?
3293,INDEX,
3294,INDEX,As he shuffled down the hall
3295,INDEX,"With the coin I'd never miss,"
3296,INDEX,"What, thought I, were fame and all"

3312,INDEX,"This shag-bark hick'ry, many a time,"
3313,INDEX,"The little fellow tried t' climb,"
3314,INDEX,An' never a spring has come but he
3315,INDEX,Has called upon his favorite tree.
3316,INDEX,I wonder what they all will say
3317,INDEX,When they are told he's marched away.
3318,INDEX,
3319,INDEX,"I wonder what the birds will say,"

3325,INDEX,Waited each spring t' tell him all
3326,INDEX,They'd done an' seen since 'way last fall.
3327,INDEX,He was the first to greet 'em here
3328,INDEX,As they returned from year t' year;
3329,INDEX,An' now I wonder what they'll say
3330,INDEX,When they are told he's marched away.
3331,INDEX,
3332,INDEX,I wonder how the roses there
3333,INDEX,"Will get along without his care,"
3334,INDEX,An' how the lilac bush will face
3335,INDEX,The loneliness about th' place;
3336,INDEX,"For ev'ry spring an' summer, he"
3337,INDEX,"Has been the chum o' plant an' tree,"

3359,INDEX,
3360,INDEX,"They went from their homes at the summons for men,"

3363,INDEX,Each cheerfully shouldered a gun.
3364,INDEX,"They were ready to die for Old Glory on high,"

3378,INDEX,"So here's to the soldiers who never saw France,"
3379,INDEX,And here's to the boys unafraid!

3396,INDEX,An' where an orchestra's at work the while the folks are dining.
3397,INDEX,"Still others seek it at their play, while some there are who roam,"

3399,INDEX,
3400,INDEX,"I like to wear my oldest clothes, an' fuss around the yard,"
3401,INDEX,"An' dig a flower bed now an' then, and pensively regard"

3403,INDEX,An' do the little odds an' ends that aren't of consequence.
3404,INDEX,"I like to trim the hedges, an' touch up the paint a bit,"
3405,INDEX,An' sort of take a homely pride in keepin' all things fit.
3406,INDEX,An' I don't envy rich folks who are sailin' o'er the foam

3408,INDEX,
3409,INDEX,"If I were fixed with money, as some other people are,"
3410,INDEX,I'd take things mighty easy; I'd not travel very far.
3411,INDEX,"I'd jes' wear my oldest trousers an' my flannel shirt, an' stay"

3435,INDEX,"He isn't counting money, and he isn't planning schemes;"
3436,INDEX,He's at home with friendly people in the shadow of his dreams.
3437,INDEX,
3438,INDEX,"When he's lived through all life's trials and his sun is in the west,"
3439,INDEX,"When he's tasted all life's pleasures and he knows which ones were best,"
3440,INDEX,"Then his mind is stored with riches, not of silver and of gold,"
3441,INDEX,But of happy smiling faces and the joys he couldn't hold.
3442,INDEX,
3443,INDEX,"Could we see what he is seeing as he's dreaming in his chair,"
3444,INDEX,We should find no scene of struggle in the distance over there.
3445,INDEX,"As he counts his memory treasures, we should see some shady lane"

3447,INDEX,
3448,INDEX,"We should meet with friendly people, simple, tender folk and kind,"
3449,INDEX,That had once been glad to love him. In his dreaming we should find
3450,INDEX,All the many little beauties that enrich the lives of men
3451,INDEX,That the eyes of youth scarce notice and the poets seldom pen.
3452,INDEX,
3453,INDEX,Age will tell you that the memory is the treasure-house of man.
3454,INDEX,"Gold and fleeting fame may vanish, but life's riches never can;"

3466,INDEX,And who has every day to face a finer round of care
3467,INDEX,Than buying frills and furbelows for little folks to wear?
3468,INDEX,
3469,INDEX,"Oh, you may brag how much you know and boast of what you do,"
3470,INDEX,"And think an all-important post has been assigned to you,"
3471,INDEX,"But I've the greatest job on earth, a task I'll never lose;"
3472,INDEX,I've several pairs of little feet to keep equipped with shoes.
3473,INDEX,
3474,INDEX,"I rather like the job I have, though humble it may be,"
3475,INDEX,And little gold or little fame may come from it to me;
3476,INDEX,It seems to me that life can give to man no finer joy
3477,INDEX,Than buying little breeches for a sturdy little boy.
3478,INDEX,
3479,INDEX,My job is not to run the world or pile up bonds and stocks;
3480,INDEX,It's just to keep two little girls in plain and fancy frocks;
3481,INDEX,"To dress and feed a growing boy whose legs are brown and stout,"
3482,INDEX,And furnish stockings just as fast as he can wear them out.
3483,INDEX,
3484,INDEX,"I would not for his crown and throne change places with a king,"
3485,INDEX,I've got the finest job on earth and unto it I'll cling;

3498,INDEX,Than all earth's glistening jewels are.
3499,INDEX,Who holds his name above all price
3500,INDEX,And chooses every sacrifice
3501,INDEX,"To keep his earthly record clear,"
3502,INDEX,Can face the world without a fear.
3503,INDEX,
3504,INDEX,"Who never cheats nor lies for gain,"

3507,INDEX,No little voice within his breast
3508,INDEX,"Disturbs his slumber. Conscience clear,"
3509,INDEX,He falls asleep with naught to fear
3510,INDEX,And when he wakes the world to face
3511,INDEX,He is not tainted by disgrace.
3512,INDEX,
3513,INDEX,Who keeps his name without a stain
3514,INDEX,Wears no man's brand and no man's chain;
3515,INDEX,He need not fear to speak his mind
3516,INDEX,In dread of what the world may find.
3517,INDEX,He then is master of his will;
3518,INDEX,"None may command him to be still,"
3519,INDEX,"Nor force him, when he would stand fast,"
3520,INDEX,To flinch before his hidden past.
3521,INDEX,
3522,INDEX,Not all the gold that men may claim
3523,INDEX,Can cover up a deed of shame;
3524,INDEX,Not all the fame of victory sweet
3525,INDEX,Can free the man who played the cheat;
3526,INDEX,He lives a slave unto the last
3527,INDEX,Unto the shame that mars his past.

3551,INDEX,Not the man he is in the day's hot strife
3552,INDEX,"And the greed and grind of a selfish life,"
3553,INDEX,But the soul of the man he is to be.
3554,INDEX,
3555,INDEX,"He feels the throbbing of life divine,"
3556,INDEX,And catches a glimpse of the greater plan;
3557,INDEX,He questions the purpose and work of man.
3558,INDEX,In the hours of silence his mind grows fine;
3559,INDEX,He seeks to learn what is kept unknown;
3560,INDEX,He turns from self and its garb of clay

3586,INDEX,The green upon the hedge.
3587,INDEX,
3588,INDEX,"We've been shut up so long, it seems"
3589,INDEX,We've lost the glamour of our dreams.
3590,INDEX,We've narrowed down as people will
3591,INDEX,Till fault is all we see.
3592,INDEX,We need to stretch our souls in air
3593,INDEX,Where there is room enough to spare;
3594,INDEX,We need the sight o' something green
3595,INDEX,On every shrub an' tree.
3596,INDEX,
3597,INDEX,But soon our petulance will pass--
3598,INDEX,Our feet will tread the dew-kissed grass;
3599,INDEX,"Our souls will break their narrow cells,"
3600,INDEX,An' swell with love once more.
3601,INDEX,"And with the blue skies overhead,"
3602,INDEX,The harsh an' hasty words we've said
3603,INDEX,"Will vanish with the snow an' ice,"
3604,INDEX,When spring unlocks the door.
3605,INDEX,
3606,INDEX,The sun will make us sweet again
3607,INDEX,With blossoms at our feet again;
3608,INDEX,"We'll wander, arm in arm, the ways"
3609,INDEX,Where beauty reigns supreme.
3610,INDEX,"An' Ma an' I shall smile again,"
3611,INDEX,"An' be ourselves awhile again,"
3612,INDEX,"An' claim, like prisoners set free,"
3613,INDEX,The charm of every dream.

3619,INDEX,
3620,INDEX,
3621,INDEX,When father couldn't wear them mother cut them down for me;
3622,INDEX,"She took the slack in fore and aft, and hemmed them at the knee;"
3623,INDEX,"They fitted rather loosely, but the things that made me glad"
3624,INDEX,Were the horizontal pockets that those good old trousers had.
3625,INDEX,
3626,INDEX,"They shone like patent leather just where well-worn breeches do,"
3627,INDEX,"But the cloth in certain portions was considered good as new,"
3628,INDEX,And I know that I was envied by full many a richer lad
3629,INDEX,For the horizontal pockets that those good old knickers had.
3630,INDEX,
3631,INDEX,"They were cut along the waist line, with the opening straight and wide,"
3632,INDEX,And there wasn't any limit to what you could get inside;
3633,INDEX,"They would hold a peck of marbles, and a knife and top and string,"
3634,INDEX,And snakes and frogs and turtles; there was room for everything.
3635,INDEX,
3636,INDEX,"Then our fortune changed a little, and my mother said that she"
3637,INDEX,"Wouldn't bother any longer fitting father's duds on me,"
3638,INDEX,But the store clothes didn't please me; there were times they made me
3639,INDEX,"sad,"
3640,INDEX,For I missed those good old pockets that my father's trousers had.

3647,INDEX,
3648,INDEX,"Tuggin' at your bottle,"
3649,INDEX,"An' it's O, you're mighty sweet!"
3650,INDEX,Just a bunch of dimples
3651,INDEX,"From your top-knot to your feet,"
3652,INDEX,Lying there an' gooin'
3653,INDEX,"In the happiest sort o' way,"
3654,INDEX,Like a rosebud peekin' at me
3655,INDEX,In the early hours o' day;
3656,INDEX,Gloating over goodness
3657,INDEX,"That you know an' sense an' clutch,"
3658,INDEX,"An' smilin' at your daddy,"
3659,INDEX,"Who loves you, O, so much!"
3660,INDEX,
3661,INDEX,"Tuggin' at your bottle,"
3662,INDEX,"As you nestle in your crib,"
3663,INDEX,With your daddy grinnin' at you
3664,INDEX,"'Cause you've dribbled on your bib,"
3665,INDEX,An' you gurgle an' you chortle
3666,INDEX,Like a brook in early Spring;
3667,INDEX,"An' you kick your pink feet gayly,"
3668,INDEX,An' I think you'd like to sing.
3669,INDEX,"All you wanted was your dinner,"
3670,INDEX,"Daddy knew it too, you bet!"
3671,INDEX,An' the moment that you got it
3672,INDEX,Then you ceased to fuss an' fret.
3673,INDEX,
3674,INDEX,"Tuggin' at your bottle,"
3675,INDEX,"Not a care, excepting when"
3676,INDEX,"You lose the rubber nipple,"
3677,INDEX,But you find it soon again;
3678,INDEX,An' the gurglin' an' the gooin'
3679,INDEX,"An' the chortlin' start anew,"
3680,INDEX,An' the kickin' an' the squirmin'
3681,INDEX,Show the wondrous joy o' you.
3682,INDEX,But I'll bet you're not as happy
3683,INDEX,"At your dinner, little tot,"
3684,INDEX,As the weather-beaten daddy
3685,INDEX,Who is bendin' o'er your cot!

3690,INDEX,The Pay Envelope
3691,INDEX,
3692,INDEX,
3693,INDEX,Is it all in the envelope holding your pay?
3694,INDEX,Is that all you're working for day after day?
3695,INDEX,Are you getting no more from your toil than the gold
3696,INDEX,That little enclosure of paper will hold?
3697,INDEX,Is that all you're after; is that all you seek?
3698,INDEX,Does that close the deal at the end of the week?
3699,INDEX,
3700,INDEX,Is it all in the envelope holding his pay?
3701,INDEX,Is that all you offer him day after day?
3702,INDEX,Is that all he wins by his labor from you?
3703,INDEX,Is that the reward for the best he can do?
3704,INDEX,"Would you say of your men, when the week has been turned,"
3705,INDEX,That all they've received is the money they've earned?
3706,INDEX,
3707,INDEX,"Is it all in the envelope, workman and chief?"
3708,INDEX,Then loyalty's days must be fleeting and brief;
3709,INDEX,If you measure your work by its value in gold
3710,INDEX,The sum of your worth by your pay shall be told;
3711,INDEX,And if something of friendship your men do not find
3712,INDEX,"Outside of their envelopes, you're the wrong kind."
3713,INDEX,
3714,INDEX,"If all that you offer is silver and gold,"
3715,INDEX,You haven't a man in your plant you can hold.
3716,INDEX,"If all that you're after each week is your pay,"
3717,INDEX,You are doing your work in a short-sighted way;
3718,INDEX,For the bigger rewards it is useless to hope
3719,INDEX,If you never can see past the pay envelope.

3729,INDEX,In your cunning little nightie
3730,INDEX,"With your pink toes peeping through,"
3731,INDEX,With your eyes closed and your hands
3732,INDEX,"Tightly clasped, while daddy stands"
3733,INDEX,"In the doorway, just to hear the"
3734,INDEX,"""God bless papa,"" lisped by you,"
3735,INDEX,"You don't know just what I feel,"
3736,INDEX,As I watch you nightly kneel
3737,INDEX,By your trundle bed and whisper
3738,INDEX,Soft and low your little prayer!
3739,INDEX,"But in all I do or plan,"
3740,INDEX,"I'm a bigger, better man"
3741,INDEX,Every time I hear you asking
3742,INDEX,God to make my journey fair.
3743,INDEX,
3744,INDEX,"Little girlie, kneeling there,"
3745,INDEX,"Lisping low your evening prayer,"
3746,INDEX,Asking God above to bless me
3747,INDEX,"At the closing of each day,"
3748,INDEX,"Oft the tears come to my eyes,"
3749,INDEX,And I feel a big lump rise
3750,INDEX,"In my throat, that I can't swallow,"
3751,INDEX,And I sometimes turn away.
3752,INDEX,"In the morning, when I wake,"
3753,INDEX,"And my post of duty take,"
3754,INDEX,I go forth with new-born courage
3755,INDEX,To accomplish what is fair;
3756,INDEX,"And, throughout the live-long day,"
3757,INDEX,I am striving every way
3758,INDEX,To come back to you each evening

3765,INDEX,
3766,INDEX,
3767,INDEX,"We've never seen the Father here, but we have known the Son,"
3768,INDEX,The finest type of manhood since the world was first begun.
3769,INDEX,"And, summing up the works of God, I write with reverent pen,"
3770,INDEX,The greatest is the Son He sent to cheer the lives of men.
3771,INDEX,
3772,INDEX,Through Him we learned the ways of God and found the Father's love;
3773,INDEX,The Son it was who won us back to Him who reigns above.
3774,INDEX,"The Lord did not come down himself to prove to men His worth,"
3775,INDEX,He sought our worship through the Child He placed upon the earth.
3776,INDEX,
3777,INDEX,How can I best express my life? Wherein does greatness lie?
3778,INDEX,"How can I long remembrance win, since I am born to die?"
3779,INDEX,"Both fame and gold are selfish things; their charms may quickly flee,"
3780,INDEX,But I'm the father of a boy who came to speak for me.
3781,INDEX,
3782,INDEX,In him lies all I hope to be; his splendor shall be mine;
3783,INDEX,I shall have done man's greatest work if only he is fine.
3784,INDEX,"If some day he shall help the world long after I am dead,"
3785,INDEX,In all that men shall say of him my praises shall be said.
3786,INDEX,
3787,INDEX,"It matters not what I may win of fleeting gold or fame,"
3788,INDEX,My hope of joy depends alone on what my boy shall claim.
3789,INDEX,"My story must be told through him, for him I work and plan,"
3790,INDEX,Man's greatest duty is to be the father of a man.

3800,INDEX,And its little cheeks seem waxen

3833,INDEX,I am content to be your dad
3834,INDEX,And share with you each pleasant game.
3835,INDEX,I am content to hold your hand
3836,INDEX,"And walk along life's path with you,"
3837,INDEX,And talk of things we understand--
3838,INDEX,The birds and trees and skies of blue.
3839,INDEX,
3840,INDEX,"Though some may seek the smiles of kings,"
3841,INDEX,For me your laughter's joy enough;
3842,INDEX,I have no wish to claim the things

3845,INDEX,"Unmindful of life's bitter cares,"
3846,INDEX,"Together watch the clouds drift by,"
3847,INDEX,Or follow boyhood's thoroughfares.
3848,INDEX,
3849,INDEX,I crave no more of life than this:
3850,INDEX,Continuance of such a trust;
3851,INDEX,"Your smile, whate'er the morning is,"
3852,INDEX,Until my clay returns to dust.
3853,INDEX,If but this comradeship may last
3854,INDEX,Until I end my earthly task--
3855,INDEX,Your hand and mine by love held fast--
3856,INDEX,Fame has no charm for which I'd ask.
3857,INDEX,
3858,INDEX,I would not trade one day with you
3859,INDEX,"To wear the purple robes of power,"
3860,INDEX,Nor drop your hand from mine to do
3861,INDEX,Some great deed in a selfish hour.
3862,INDEX,For you have brought me joy serene
3863,INDEX,And made my soul supremely glad.
3864,INDEX,In life rewarded I have been;

3875,INDEX,"Dogs have a way of knowin' things,"
3876,INDEX,"An' when the dreaded cable came,"
3877,INDEX,He looked at mother an' he whined
3878,INDEX,"His soft, low sign of somethin' wrong,"
3879,INDEX,As though he knew that we should find
3880,INDEX,The news that we had feared so long.
3881,INDEX,
3882,INDEX,He's followed me about the place
3883,INDEX,An' hasn't left my heels to-day;
3884,INDEX,He's rubbed his nose against my face
3885,INDEX,As if to kiss my grief away.
3886,INDEX,There on his plate beside the door
3887,INDEX,You'll see untouched his mornin' meal.
3888,INDEX,I never understood before
3889,INDEX,That dogs share every hurt you feel.
3890,INDEX,
3891,INDEX,We've got the pride o' service fine
3892,INDEX,As consolation for the blow;
3893,INDEX,We know by many a written line
3894,INDEX,He went the way he wished to go.
3895,INDEX,We know that God an' Country found
3896,INDEX,Our boy a servant brave an' true--
3897,INDEX,But Pete must sadly walk around
3898,INDEX,An' miss the master that he knew.
3899,INDEX,

3902,INDEX,The hurt I feel I needn't tell--

3923,INDEX,You shall hear them gayly singing as the dreamboat's putting in.
3924,INDEX,
3925,INDEX,"Like the ripple of the water does the dreamboat's whistle blow,"
3926,INDEX,"Only baby ears can catch it when it comes the time to go,"

3929,INDEX,
3930,INDEX,"Oh, the little eyes are heavy but the little soul is light;"

3964,INDEX,"They are romping with their children in the fields of clover sweet,"
3965,INDEX,And devotedly they guard them from the perils of the street.
3966,INDEX,
3967,INDEX,"They are here in countless numbers, just as they have always been,"
3968,INDEX,And their glory is untainted by the selfish and the mean.

3983,INDEX,"I like to have them all alone, with no one near to hear or see,"
3984,INDEX,"Then as their little faults they own, I like to take them on my knee"

3987,INDEX,
3988,INDEX,"Within the world there's no such charm as children penitent and sad,"
3989,INDEX,"Who put two soft and chubby arms around your neck, when they've been bad."
3990,INDEX,"And as you view their trembling lips, away your temper starts to run,"
3991,INDEX,And from your mind all anger slips--forgiving them is so much fun.
3992,INDEX,
3993,INDEX,If there were nothing to forgive I wonder if we'd love them so;
3994,INDEX,"If they were wise enough to live as grown-ups do, and always go"

4043,INDEX,"They lift up my eyelids and tickle my nose,"
4044,INDEX,And scratch at my cheeks with their little pink toes;
4045,INDEX,And sometimes to give them a laugh and a scare
4046,INDEX,I snap and I growl like a cinnamon bear;
4047,INDEX,"Then over I roll, and with three kids astride"
4048,INDEX,I gallop away on their feather-bed ride.
4049,INDEX,
4050,INDEX,I've thought it all over. Man's biggest mistake
4051,INDEX,Is in wanting to sleep when his babes are awake;
4052,INDEX,When they come to his room for that first bit of fun
4053,INDEX,He should make up his mind that his sleeping is done;
4054,INDEX,He should share in the laughter they bring to his side
4055,INDEX,And start off the day with that feather-bed ride.
4056,INDEX,
4057,INDEX,Oh they're fun at their breakfast and fun at their lunch;
4058,INDEX,Any hour of the day they're a glorious bunch!
4059,INDEX,"When they're togged up for Sundays they're certainly fine,"
4060,INDEX,"And I'm glad in my heart I can call them all mine,"
4061,INDEX,But I think that the time that I like them the best

4082,INDEX,The glory of the fine.
4083,INDEX,"But, oh, when someone speaks to me,"

4095,INDEX,Whoever can he be.

4123,INDEX,"He liked the little ways I had, the simple things I said;"
4124,INDEX,"Sometimes he gave me words of praise, sometimes he stroked my head;"
4125,INDEX,"And when I'd done a thing worth while, the thought that made me glad"
4126,INDEX,"Was always that I'd done my best, and that would please my dad."
4127,INDEX,
4128,INDEX,I can look back to-day and see how proud he used to be
4129,INDEX,When I'd come home from school and say they'd recommended me.
4130,INDEX,"I didn't understand it then, for school boys never do,"
4131,INDEX,But in a vague and general way it seems to me I knew
4132,INDEX,"That father took great pride in me, and wanted me to shine,"
4133,INDEX,And that it meant a lot to him when I'd done something fine.
4134,INDEX,
4135,INDEX,"Then one day out of school I went, amid the great world's hum,"
4136,INDEX,"An office boy, and father watched each night to see me come."
4137,INDEX,And I recall how proud he was of me that wondrous day
4138,INDEX,"When I could tell him that, unasked, the firm had raised my pay."
4139,INDEX,"I still can feel that hug he gave, I understand the joy"
4140,INDEX,It meant to him to learn that men were trusting in his boy.
4141,INDEX,
4142,INDEX,I wonder will it please my dad? How oft the thought occurs
4143,INDEX,"When I am stumbling on the paths, beset with briars and burrs!"
4144,INDEX,"He isn't here to see me now, alone my race I run,"
4145,INDEX,And yet some day I'll go to him and tell him all I've done.
4146,INDEX,And oh I pray that when we meet beyond life's stormy sea
4147,INDEX,That he may claim the old-time joy of being proud of me.

4177,INDEX,The roses that ramble and twine on the wall were
4178,INDEX,planted by one that was kind
4179,INDEX,"An' I'm sure as I stand here an' gaze on them all,"
4180,INDEX,that his soul has still lingered behind.

4209,INDEX,Who nobly serves from day to day

4221,INDEX,"The poorest man can still be kind,"
4222,INDEX,And nobly live till life is through.
4223,INDEX,
4224,INDEX,These joys abound for one and all:
4225,INDEX,"The pride of fearing no man's scorn,"
4226,INDEX,"Of standing firm, where others fall,"

4477,INDEX,He couldn't use his driver any better on the tee
4478,INDEX,"Than the chap that he was licking, who just happened to be me;"
4479,INDEX,"I could hit them with a brassie just as straight and just as far,"
4480,INDEX,But I piled up several sevens while he made a few in par;
4481,INDEX,"And he trimmed me to a finish, and I know the reason why:"
4482,INDEX,He could keep his temper better when he dubbed a shot than I.
4483,INDEX,
4484,INDEX,"His mashie stroke is choppy, without any follow through;"
4485,INDEX,"I doubt if he will ever, on a short hole, cop a two,"
4486,INDEX,"But his putts are straight and deadly, and he doesn't even frown"
4487,INDEX,When he's tried to hole a long one and just fails to get it down.
4488,INDEX,"On the fourteenth green I faded; there he put me on the shelf,"
4489,INDEX,And it's not to his discredit when I say I licked myself.
4490,INDEX,
4491,INDEX,He never whined or whimpered when a shot of his went wrong;
4492,INDEX,"Never kicked about his troubles, but just plodded right along."
4493,INDEX,"When he flubbed an easy iron, though I knew that he was vexed,"
4494,INDEX,"He merely shrugged his shoulders, and then coolly played the next,"
4495,INDEX,While I flew into a frenzy over every dub I made
4496,INDEX,And was loud in my complaining at the dismal game I played.
4497,INDEX,
4498,INDEX,Golf is like the game of living; it will show up what you are;
4499,INDEX,If you take your troubles badly you will never play to par.
4500,INDEX,You may be a fine performer when your skies are bright and blue
4501,INDEX,But disaster is the acid that shall prove the worth of you;
4502,INDEX,"So just meet your disappointments with a cheery sort of grin,"
4503,INDEX,For the man who keeps his temper is the man that's sure to win.

4510,INDEX,
4511,INDEX,My Pa can hit his thumbnail with a hammer and keep still;
4512,INDEX,He can cut himself while shaving an' not swear;
4513,INDEX,If a ladder slips beneath him an' he gets a nasty spill
4514,INDEX,He can smile as though he really didn't care.
4515,INDEX,But the pan beneath the ice-box--when he goes to empty that--
4516,INDEX,Then a sound-proof room the children have to hunt;
4517,INDEX,For we have a sad few minutes in our very pleasant flat
4518,INDEX,When the water in it splashes down his front.
4519,INDEX,
4520,INDEX,My Pa believes his temper should be all the time controlled;
4521,INDEX,He doesn't rave at every little thing;
4522,INDEX,When his collar-button underneath the chiffonier has rolled
4523,INDEX,A snatch of merry ragtime he will sing.
4524,INDEX,But the pan beneath the ice box--when to empty that he goes--
4525,INDEX,As he stoops to drag it out we hear a grunt;
4526,INDEX,"From the kitchen comes a rumble, an' then everybody knows"
4527,INDEX,That he splashed the water in it down his front.
4528,INDEX,
4529,INDEX,Now the distance from the ice box to the sink's not very far--
4530,INDEX,I'm sure it isn't over twenty feet--
4531,INDEX,"But though very short the journey, it is long enough for Pa"
4532,INDEX,As he travels it disaster grim to meet.
4533,INDEX,"And it's seldom that he makes it without accident, although"
4534,INDEX,In the summer time it is his nightly stunt;
4535,INDEX,And he says a lot of language that no gentleman should know
4536,INDEX,When the water in it splashes down his front.
