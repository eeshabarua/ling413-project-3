59,PREFACE,PREFACE
60,PREFACE,
61,PREFACE,The four poems in this book are more closely related to one another
62,PREFACE,"than may at first appear.  They all owe their existence to the war,"
63,PREFACE,"for I suppose that, had there been no war, I should never have"
64,PREFACE,"thought of them.  They are scarcely war poems, in the strict sense of"
65,PREFACE,"the word, nor are they allegories in which the present is made to"
66,PREFACE,"masquerade as the past.  Rather, they are the result of a vision"
67,PREFACE,thrown suddenly back upon remote events to explain a strange and
68,PREFACE,"terrible reality.  ""Explain"" is hardly the word, for to explain the"
69,PREFACE,"subtle causes which force men, once in so often, to attempt to break"
70,PREFACE,"the civilization they have been at pains to rear, and so oblige"
71,PREFACE,"other, saner, men to oppose them, is scarcely the province of poetry."
72,PREFACE,"Poetry works more deviously, but perhaps not less conclusively."
73,PREFACE,
74,PREFACE,"It has frequently been asserted that an artist lives apart, that he"
75,PREFACE,must withdraw himself from events and be somehow above and beyond
76,PREFACE,"them.  To a certain degree this is true, as withdrawal is usually an"
77,PREFACE,"inherent quality of his nature, but to seek such a withdrawal is both"
78,PREFACE,ridiculous and frustrating.  For an artist to shut himself up in the
79,PREFACE,"proverbial ""ivory tower"" and never look out of the window is merely a"
80,PREFACE,"tacit admission that it is his ancestors, not he, who possess the"
81,PREFACE,faculty of creation.  This is the real decadence: to see through the
82,PREFACE,"eyes of dead men.  Yet to-day can never be adequately expressed,"
83,PREFACE,largely because we are a part of it and only a part.  For that reason
84,PREFACE,one is flung backwards to a time which is not thrown out of
85,PREFACE,"proportion by any personal experience, and which on that very account"
86,PREFACE,lies extended in something like its proper perspective.
87,PREFACE,
88,PREFACE,"Circumstances beget an interest in like circumstances, and a poet,"
89,PREFACE,"suddenly finding himself in the midst of war, turns naturally to the"
90,PREFACE,experiences of other men in other wars.  He discovers something which
91,PREFACE,"has always hitherto struck him as preposterous, that life goes on in"
92,PREFACE,"spite of war.  That war itself is an expression of life, a barbaric"
93,PREFACE,expression on one side calling for an heroic expression on the other.
94,PREFACE,It is as if a door in his brain crashed open and he looked into a
95,PREFACE,distance of which he had heard but never before seen.  History has
96,PREFACE,"become life, and he stands aghast and exhilarated before it."
97,PREFACE,
98,PREFACE,That is why I have chosen Mr. Aldington's poem as a motto to this
99,PREFACE,book.  For it is obvious that I cannot have experienced what I have
100,PREFACE,"here written.  I must have got it from books.  But, living now, in"
101,PREFACE,"the midst of events greater than these, the books have become reality"
102,PREFACE,"to me in a way that they never could have become before, and the"
103,PREFACE,stories I have dug out of dusty volumes seem as actual as my own
104,PREFACE,existence.  I hope that a little of this vividness may have got into
105,PREFACE,"the poems themselves, and so may reach my readers.  Perhaps it has"
106,PREFACE,"been an impossible task, I can only say that I was compelled to"
107,PREFACE,attempt it.
108,PREFACE,
109,PREFACE,"The poems are written in ""polyphonic prose,"" a form which has proved"
110,PREFACE,"a stumbling-block to many people.  ""Polyphonic prose"" is perhaps a"
111,PREFACE,"misleading title, as it tends to make the layman think that this is a"
112,PREFACE,prose form.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The word
113,PREFACE,"""prose"" in its title simply refers to the manner in which the words"
114,PREFACE,"are printed; ""polyphonic""--many-voiced--giving the real key."
115,PREFACE,"""Polyphonic prose"" is the freest, the most elastic, of all forms, for"
116,PREFACE,"it follows at will any, and all, of the rules which guide other"
117,PREFACE,"forms.  Metrical verse has one set of laws, cadenced verse another;"
118,PREFACE,"""polyphonic prose"" can go from one to the other in the same poem with"
119,PREFACE,no sense of incongruity.  Its only touchstone is the taste and
120,PREFACE,feeling of its author.
121,PREFACE,
122,PREFACE,"Yet, like all other artistic forms, it has certain fundamental"
123,PREFACE,"principles, and the chief of these is an insistence on the absolute"
124,PREFACE,adequacy of the manner of a passage to the thought it embodies.
125,PREFACE,Taste is therefore its determining factor; taste and a rhythmic ear.
126,PREFACE,
127,PREFACE,"In the preface to ""Sword Blades and Poppy Seed,"" I stated that I had"
128,PREFACE,"found the idea of the form in the works of the French poet, M. Paul"
129,PREFACE,Fort.  But in adapting it for use in English I was obliged to make so
130,PREFACE,many changes that it may now be considered as practically a new form.
131,PREFACE,The greatest of these changes was in the matter of rhythm.  M. Fort's
132,PREFACE,"practice consists, almost entirely, of regular verse passages"
133,PREFACE,interspersed with regular prose passages.  But a hint in one of his
134,PREFACE,poems led me to believe that a closer blending of the two types was
135,PREFACE,"desirable, and here at the very outset I met with a difficulty."
136,PREFACE,Every form of art must have a base; to depart satisfactorily from a
137,PREFACE,rhythm it is first necessary to have it.  M. Fort found this basic
138,PREFACE,rhythm in the alexandrine.  But the rhythm of the alexandrine is not
139,PREFACE,one of the basic rhythms to an English ear.  Altered from syllables
140,PREFACE,"to accent, it becomes light, even frivolous, in texture.  There"
141,PREFACE,appeared to be only one basic rhythm for English serious verse:
142,PREFACE,"iambic pentameter, which, either rhymed as in the ""heroic couplet"" or"
143,PREFACE,"unrhymed as in ""blank verse,"" seems the chief foundation of English"
144,PREFACE,"metre.  It is so heavy and so marked, however, that it is a difficult"
145,PREFACE,rhythm to depart from and go back to; therefore I at once discarded
146,PREFACE,it for my purpose.
147,PREFACE,
148,PREFACE,"Putting aside one rhythm of English prosody after another, I finally"
149,PREFACE,"decided to base my form upon the long, flowing cadence of oratorical"
150,PREFACE,prose.  The variations permitted to this cadence enable the poet to
151,PREFACE,"change the more readily into those of _vers libre_, or even to take"
152,PREFACE,"the regular beat of metre, should such a marked time seem advisable."
153,PREFACE,"It is, of course, important that such changes should appear as not"
154,PREFACE,only adequate but necessary when the poem is read aloud.  And so I
155,PREFACE,have found it.  However puzzled a reader may be in trying to
156,PREFACE,"apprehend with the eye a prose which is certainly not prose, I have"
157,PREFACE,never noticed that an audience experiences the slightest confusion in
158,PREFACE,"hearing a ""polyphonic prose"" poem read aloud.  I admit that the"
159,PREFACE,"typographical arrangement of this form is far from perfect, but I"
160,PREFACE,have not as yet been able to hit upon a better.  As all printing is a
161,PREFACE,"mere matter of convention, however, I hope that people will soon"
162,PREFACE,learn to read it with no more difficulty than a musician knows in
163,PREFACE,reading a musical score.
164,PREFACE,
165,PREFACE,So much for the vexed question of rhythm.  Others of the many voices
166,PREFACE,"of ""polyphonic prose"" are rhyme, assonance, alliteration, and return."
167,PREFACE,"Rhyme is employed to give a richness of effect, to heighten the"
168,PREFACE,"musical feeling of a passage, but it is employed in a different way"
169,PREFACE,"from that usual in metrical verse.  For, although the poet may,"
170,PREFACE,"indeed must, employ rhyme, it is not done always, nor, for the most"
171,PREFACE,"part, regularly.  In other words, the rhymes should seldom come at"
172,PREFACE,"the ends of the cadences, unless such an effect be especially"
173,PREFACE,desired.  This use of rhyme has been another difficulty to readers.
174,PREFACE,"Seeing rhymes, their minds have been compelled by their seeming"
175,PREFACE,"strangeness to pull them, Jack-Horner-like, out of the text and"
176,PREFACE,"unduly notice them, to the detriment of the passage in which they are"
177,PREFACE,"embedded.  Hearing them read without stress, they pass unobserved,"
178,PREFACE,merely adding their quota of tonal colour to the whole.
179,PREFACE,
180,PREFACE,"Return in ""polyphonic prose"" is usually achieved by the recurrence of"
181,PREFACE,"a dominant thought or image, coming in irregularly and in varying"
182,PREFACE,"words, but still giving the spherical effect which I have frequently"
183,PREFACE,spoken of as imperative in all poetry.
184,PREFACE,
185,PREFACE,"It will be seen, therefore, that ""polyphonic prose"" is, in a sense,"
186,PREFACE,an orchestral form.  Its tone is not merely single and melodic as is
187,PREFACE,"that of _vers libre_, for instance, but contrapuntal and various.  I"
188,PREFACE,"have analyzed it here with some care because, as all the poems in"
189,PREFACE,"this volume are written in it, some knowledge of how to approach it"
190,PREFACE,"is necessary if one is to understand them.  I trust, however, that my"
191,PREFACE,readers will speedily forget matters of technique on turning to the
192,PREFACE,poems themselves.
193,PREFACE,
194,PREFACE,"One thing more I wish to say in regard to ""Guns as Keys: and the"
195,PREFACE,"Great Gate Swings.""  I should be exceedingly sorry if any part of"
196,PREFACE,"this poem were misunderstood, and so construed into an expression of"
197,PREFACE,discourtesy toward Japan.  No such idea entered my mind in writing
198,PREFACE,"it; in fact, the Japanese sections in the first part were intended to"
199,PREFACE,convey quite the opposite meaning.  I wanted to place in
200,PREFACE,juxtaposition the delicacy and artistic clarity of Japan and the
201,PREFACE,artistic ignorance and gallant self-confidence of America.  Of
202,PREFACE,"course, each country must be supposed to have the faults of its"
203,PREFACE,"virtues; if, therefore, I have also opposed Oriental craft to"
204,PREFACE,"Occidental bluff, I must beg indulgence."
205,PREFACE,
206,PREFACE,I have tried to give a picture of two races at a moment when they
207,PREFACE,were brought in contact for the first time.  Which of them has gained
208,PREFACE,"most by this meeting, it would be difficult to say.  The two episodes"
209,PREFACE,"in the ""Postlude"" are facts, but they can hardly epitomize the whole"
210,PREFACE,"truth.  Still they are striking, occurring as they did in the same"
211,PREFACE,year.  I owe the scene of the drowning of the young student in the
212,PREFACE,"Kegon waterfall to the paper ""Young Japan,"" by Seichi Naruse, which"
213,PREFACE,"appeared in the ""Seven Arts"" for April, 1917.  The inscription on the"
214,PREFACE,"tree I have copied word for word from Mr. Naruse's translation, and I"
215,PREFACE,"wish here to express my thanks, not for his permission (as with a"
216,PREFACE,"perfect disregard of morals, I never asked it), but for his beautiful"
217,PREFACE,rendering of the original Japanese.  I trust that my appreciation
218,PREFACE,will exonerate my theft.

587,NAPLES,"hours, he and she, discussing the destiny of the Kingdom of the Two"
588,NAPLES,"Sicilies, and her voice is like water tinkling over stones, and her"

590,NAPLES,
591,NAPLES,"She counts his money for him, and laughs at his inability to reduce"
592,NAPLES,carotins to English sixpences.  She drives him out to Caserta to see

594,NAPLES,"people.  She is always before him, a mist of rose and silver, a"

596,NAPLES,
597,NAPLES,"In the evenings, by the light of two wax candles, the Admiral writes"
598,NAPLES,kind acknowledgements to the tributes of half a world.  Moslem and
599,NAPLES,Christian sweetly united to stamp out liberty.  It is an inspiring
600,NAPLES,"sight to see.  Rule Britannia indeed, with Slavs and Turks boosting"
601,NAPLES,up her footstool.  The Sultan has sent a Special Envoy bearing gifts:
602,NAPLES,"the _Chelenck_--""Plume of Triumph,"" all in diamonds, and a pelisse of"
603,NAPLES,"sables, just as bonds of his eternal gratitude.  ""_Viva il Turco!_"""
604,NAPLES,says Lady Hamilton.  The Mother of His Sultanic Majesty begs that the
605,NAPLES,Admiral's pocket may be the repository of a diamond-studded box to
606,NAPLES,"hold his snuff.  The Russian Tzar, a bit self-centred as most"
607,NAPLES,"monarchs are, sends him his portrait, diamond-framed of course.  The"
608,NAPLES,King of Sardinia glosses over his fewer gems by the richness of his
609,NAPLES,"compliments.  The East India Company, secure of its trade, has paid"
610,NAPLES,him ten thousand pounds.  The Turkish Company has given him plate.  A
611,NAPLES,grateful country augments his state by creating him the smallest kind
612,NAPLES,"of peer, with a couple of tuppences a year, and veneering it over by"
613,NAPLES,"a grant of arms.  Arms for an arm, but what for an eye!  Does the"
614,NAPLES,Admiral smile as he writes his reply?  Writes with his left hand that
615,NAPLES,"he is aware of the high honour it will be to bear this shield: ""A"
616,NAPLES,"chief undulated argent, from which a palm-tree issuant, between a"
617,NAPLES,"disabled ship on the dexter, and a ruinous battery on the sinister,"
618,NAPLES,"all proper.""  ""Very proper, indeed,"" nods Sir William, but Lady"
619,NAPLES,"Hamilton prods the coloured paper shield a trifle scornfully.  ""If I"
620,NAPLES,"was King of England, I would make you Duke Nelson, Marquis Nile, Earl"
621,NAPLES,"Aboukir, Viscount Pyramid, Baron Crocodile and Prince Victory.""  ""My"
622,NAPLES,"dear Emma, what a child you are,"" says Sir William, but the Admiral"
623,NAPLES,looks out of the window at the blood-red mountain and says nothing at
624,NAPLES,all.
625,NAPLES,
626,NAPLES,Something shakes Naples.  Shakes so violently that it makes the
627,NAPLES,"candles on the Admiral's writing-table flicker.  Earthquakes,"
628,NAPLES,"perhaps.  Aye, earthquakes, but not from the red, plumed mountain."
629,NAPLES,The dreadful tread of marching men is rocking the Bourbon Kingdom of
630,NAPLES,"the Two Sicilies, and the fanfare of Republican trumpets blows over"
631,NAPLES,the city like a great wind.  It swirls the dust of Monarchy in front
632,NAPLES,"of it, across Naples and out over the Chiaia to the sea."
633,NAPLES,
634,NAPLES,"The Admiral walks his quarter-deck with the blue bay beneath him, but"
635,NAPLES,"his eyes are red with the glare of Vesuvius, and the blood beats in"
636,NAPLES,and out of his heart so rapidly that he is almost stifled.  All
637,NAPLES,"Naples is red to the Admiral, but the core of crimson is the Palazzo"
638,NAPLES,"Sesso, in whose windows, at night, the silver stars flash so"
639,NAPLES,"brightly.  ""Crimson and silver,"" thinks the Admiral, ""O Emma, Emma"
640,NAPLES,"Hamilton!"""
641,NAPLES,
642,NAPLES,"It is December now, and Naples is heaving and shuddering with the"
643,NAPLES,force of the Earth shock.  There is no firm ground on which to stand.
644,NAPLES,Beneath the Queen's footsteps is a rocking jelly.  Even the water of
645,NAPLES,the bay boils and churns and knocks loudly against the wooden sides
646,NAPLES,of the British ships.
647,NAPLES,
648,NAPLES,"Over the satin-wood table, the Admiral and the Ambassadress sit in"
649,NAPLES,"consultation, and red fire flares between them across its polished"
650,NAPLES,"surface.  ""My adorable, unfortunate Queen!  Dear, dear Queen!""  Lady"
651,NAPLES,Hamilton's eyes are carbuncles burning into the Admiral's soul.  He
652,NAPLES,"is dazzled, confused, used to the glare on blue water he thinks he"
653,NAPLES,sees it now.  It is Duty and Kings.  Caste versus riff-raff.  The
654,NAPLES,roast-beef of old England against fried frogs' legs.
655,NAPLES,
656,NAPLES,"Red, blood-red, figures the weaving pattern, red blushing over blue,"
657,NAPLES,"flushing the fabric purple, like lees of wine."
658,NAPLES,
659,NAPLES,"A blustering night to go to a party.  But the coach is ready, and"
660,NAPLES,Lord Nelson is arrived from his ship.  Official persons cannot give
661,NAPLES,"the slip to other official persons, and it is Kelim Effendi who gives"
662,NAPLES,"the reception, the Sultan's Special Envoy.  ""Wait,"" to the coachman;"
663,NAPLES,"then lights, jewels, sword-clickings, compliments, a promenade round"
664,NAPLES,"the rooms, bowing, and a quick, unwatched exit from a side door."
665,NAPLES,Someone will wake the snoring coachman hours hence and send him away.
666,NAPLES,"But it will not be his Master or Mistress.  These hurry through dark,"
667,NAPLES,windy streets to the Molesiglio.  How the waves flow by in the
668,NAPLES,"darkness!  ""A heavy ground-swell,"" says the Admiral, but there is a"
669,NAPLES,lull in the wind.  A password in English--we are all very English
670,NAPLES,"to-night.  ""Can you find your way, Emma?""  Sir William is perturbed."
671,NAPLES,"But the Ambassadress is gone, gone lightly, swiftly, up the dark mole"
672,NAPLES,"and disappeared through a postern in the wall.  She is aflame,"
673,NAPLES,"scorching with red and gold fires, a torch of scarlet and ochre, a"
674,NAPLES,meteor of sulphur and chrome dashed with vermilion.
675,NAPLES,
676,NAPLES,"There are massacres in the streets of Naples; in the Palace, a"
677,NAPLES,"cowering Queen.  This is melodrama, and Emma is the Princess of Opera"
678,NAPLES,"Bouffe.  Opera Bouffe, with Death as Pulchinello.  Ho!  Ho!  You"
679,NAPLES,"laugh.  A merry fellow, and how if Death had you by the gizzard?"
680,NAPLES,"Comedy and Tragedy shift masks, but Emma is intent on her task and"
681,NAPLES,"sees neither.  Frightened, vacillating monarchs to guide down a"

683,NAPLES,"lanterns, cutlasses, pistols, and, at last, the night air, black"

685,NAPLES,
686,NAPLES,"They are afloat, off the trembling, quivering soil of Naples, and"

1443,PART I,"At the four corners, they have placed lanterns,"
1444,PART I,And now they come.
1445,PART I,"Six attendants,"
1446,PART I,"Three to sit on either side of the condemned man,"
1447,PART I,Walking slowly.
1448,PART I,"Three to the right,"
1449,PART I,"Three to the left,"
1450,PART I,And he between them
1451,PART I,In his dress of ceremony
1452,PART I,With the great wings.
1453,PART I,"Shadow wings, thrown by the lantern light,"
1454,PART I,"Trail over the red rugs to the polished floor,"
1455,PART I,"Trail away unnoticed,"
1456,PART I,For there is a sharp glitter from a dagger
1457,PART I,Borne past the lanterns on a silver tray.
1458,PART I,"""O my Master,"
1459,PART I,"I would borrow your sword,"
1460,PART I,For it may be a consolation to you
1461,PART I,"To perish by a sword to which you are accustomed."""
1462,PART I,"Stone, the face of the condemned man,"
1463,PART I,"Stone, the face of the executioner,"
1464,PART I,And yet before this moment
1465,PART I,"These were master and pupil,"
1466,PART I,"Honoured and according homage,"
1467,PART I,And this is an act of honourable devotion.
1468,PART I,"Each face is passive,"
1469,PART I,"Hewed as out of strong stone,"
1470,PART I,Cold as a statue above a temple porch.
1471,PART I,Down slips the dress of ceremony to the girdle.
1472,PART I,Plunge the dagger to its hilt.
1473,PART I,A trickle of blood runs along the white flesh
1474,PART I,And soaks into the girdle silk.
1475,PART I,"Slowly across from left to right,"
1476,PART I,"Slowly, upcutting at the end,"
1477,PART I,"But the executioner leaps to his feet,"
1478,PART I,Poises the sword--
1479,PART I,"Did it flash, hover, descend?"
1480,PART I,"There is a thud, a horrible rolling,"
1481,PART I,"And the heavy sound of a loosened, falling body,"
1482,PART I,Then only the throbbing of blood
1483,PART I,Spurting into the red rugs.
1484,PART I,For he who was a man is that thing
1485,PART I,"Crumpled up on the floor,"
1486,PART I,"Broken, and crushed into the red rugs."
1487,PART I,"The friend wipes the sword,"
1488,PART I,And his face is calm and frozen
1489,PART I,As a stone statue on a Winter night
1490,PART I,Above a temple gateway.

1500,PART II,"Peace,"" caparisoned in state, cleaving a jewelled ocean to a Dragon"
1501,PART II,"Gate.  Behind it, the quiet of afternoon.  Golden light reflecting"
1502,PART II,"from the inner sides of shut portals.  War is an old wives' tale, a"
1503,PART II,frail beautiful embroidery of other ages.  The panoply of battle
1504,PART II,"fades.  Arrows rust in arsenals, spears stand useless on their butts"
1505,PART II,"in vestibules.  Cannon lie unmounted in castle yards, and rats and"
1506,PART II,snakes make nests in them and rear their young in unmolested
1507,PART II,satisfaction.
1508,PART II,
1509,PART II,"The sun of Mid-Summer lies over the ""Land of Great Peace,"" and behind"

1513,PART II,
1514,PART II,
1515,PART II,"_Susquehanna_ and _Mississippi_, steamers, towing _Saratoga_ and"
1516,PART II,"_Plymouth_, sloops of war.  Moving on in the very eye of the wind,"
1517,PART II,with not a snip of canvas upon their slim yards.  Fugi!--a point
1518,PART II,"above nothing, for there is a haze.  Stop gazing, that is the bugle"
1519,PART II,"to clear decks and shot guns.  We must be prepared, as we run up the"
1520,PART II,"coast straight to the Bay of Yedo.  ""I say, fellows, those boats"
1521,PART II,"think they can catch us, they don't know that this is Yankee steam."""
1522,PART II,Bang!  The shore guns are at work.  And that smoke-ball would be a

1524,PART II,
1525,PART II,"Black with people are the bluffs of Uraga, watching the ""fire-ships,"""
1526,PART II,"lipping windless up the bay.  Say all the prayers you know, priests"
1527,PART II,"of Shinto and Buddha.  Ah!  The great splashing of the wheels stops,"
1528,PART II,a chain rattles.  The anchor drops at the Hour of the Ape.
1529,PART II,
1530,PART II,A clock on the Commodore's chest of drawers strikes five with a
1531,PART II,silvery tinkle.
1532,PART II,
1533,PART II,
1534,PART II,Boats are coming from all directions.  Beautiful boats of unpainted
1535,PART II,"wood, broad of beam, with tapering sterns, and clean runs.  Swiftly"
1536,PART II,"they come, with shouting rowers standing to their oars.  The shore"
1537,PART II,glitters with spears and lacquered hats.  Compactly the boats
1538,PART II,"advance, and each carries a flag--white-black-white--and the stripes"
1539,PART II,break and blow.  But the tow-lines are cast loose when the rowers
1540,PART II,"would make them fast to the ""black ships,"" and those who would climb"
1541,PART II,"the chains slip back dismayed, checked by a show of cutlasses,"
1542,PART II,"pistols, pikes.  ""_Naru Hodo!_"" This is amazing, unprecedented!  Even"
1543,PART II,"the Vice-Governor, though he boards the Susquehanna, cannot see the"

1546,PART II,
1547,PART II,"Rockets rise from the forts, and their trails of sparks glitter"

1551,PART II,"Bolt the gate, monkey-men, but it is late to begin turning locks so"

1554,PART II,
1555,PART II,Darkness over rice-fields and hills.  The Gold Gate hides in shadow.
1556,PART II,"Upon the indigo-dark water, millions of white jelly-fish drift, like"
1557,PART II,"lotus-petals over an inland lake.  The land buzzes with prayer, low,"
1558,PART II,dim smoke hanging in air; and every hill gashes and glares with
1559,PART II,"shooting fires.  The fire-bells are ringing in double time, and a"
1560,PART II,heavy swinging boom clashes from the great bells of temples.
1561,PART II,"Couriers lash their horses, riding furiously to Yedo; junks and"
1562,PART II,"scull-boats arrive hourly at Shinagawa with news; runners, bearing"
1563,PART II,"dispatches, pant in government offices.  The hollow doors of the"
1564,PART II,Great Gate beat with alarms.  The charmed Dragon Country shakes and
1565,PART II,"trembles, Iyéyoshi, twelfth Shōgun of the Tokugawa line,"
1566,PART II,"sits in his city.  Sits in the midst of one million, two hundred"
1567,PART II,"thousand trembling souls, and his mind rolls forward and back like a"
1568,PART II,"ball on a circular runway, and finds no goal.  Roll, poor distracted"
1569,PART II,"mind of a sick man.  What can you do but wait, trusting in your"
1570,PART II,"Dragon Gate, for how should you know that it is rusted."
1571,PART II,
1572,PART II,"But there is a sign over the ""black ships.""  A wedge-shaped tail of"
1573,PART II,"blue sparklets, edged with red, trails above them as though a Dragon"
1574,PART II,"were pouring violet sulphurous spume from steaming nostrils, and the"
1575,PART II,"hulls and rigging are pale, quivering, bright as Taira ghosts on the"
1576,PART II,sea of Nagato.
1577,PART II,
1578,PART II,"Up and down walk sentinels, fore and aft, and at the side gangways."
1579,PART II,There is a pile of round shot and four stands of grape beside each
1580,PART II,"gun; and carbines, and pistols, and cutlasses, are laid in the boats."
1581,PART II,Floating arsenals--floating sample-rooms for the wares of a
1582,PART II,"continent; shop-counters, flanked with weapons, adrift among the"
1583,PART II,jelly-fishes.
1584,PART II,
1585,PART II,"Eight bells, and the meteor washes away before the wet, white wisps"
1586,PART II,of dawn.
1587,PART II,
1588,PART II,
1589,PART II,"Through the countrysides of the ""Land of Great Peace,"" flowers are"
1590,PART II,"blooming.  The greenish-white, sterile blossoms of hydrangeas boom"
1591,PART II,"faintly, like distant inaudible bombs of colour exploding in the"
1592,PART II,woods.  Weigelias prick the pink of their slender trumpets against
1593,PART II,green backgrounds.  The fan-shaped leaves of ladies' slippers rustle
1594,PART II,under cryptomerias.
1595,PART II,
1596,PART II,Midsummer heat curls about the cinnamon-red tree-boles along the
1597,PART II,"Tokaido.  The road ripples and glints with the passing to and fro,"
1598,PART II,"and beyond, in the roadstead, the ""black ships"" swing at their"
1599,PART II,anchors and wait.
1600,PART II,
1601,PART II,"All up and down the Eastern shore of the bay is a feverish digging,"
1602,PART II,"patting, plastering.  Forts to be built in an hour to resist the"
1603,PART II,"barbarians, if, peradventure, they can.  Japan turned to, what will"
1604,PART II,"it not do!  Fishermen and palanquin-bearers, pack-horse-leaders and"
1605,PART II,"farm-labourers, even women and children, pat and plaster.  Disaster"
1606,PART II,"batters at the Dragon Gate.  Batters at the doors of Yedo, where"

1608,PART II,

1612,PART II,to go to Kiōto!  Then indeed would the Tokugawa fall.  The
1613,PART II,prisons are crammed with those who advise opening the Gate.  Open the
1614,PART II,"Gate, and let the State scatter like dust to the winds!  Absurd!"
1615,PART II,"Unthinkable!  Suppress the ""brocade pictures"" of the floating"
1616,PART II,monsters with which book-sellers and picture-shop keepers are
1617,PART II,delighting and affrighting the populace.  Place a ban on speech.
1618,PART II,"Preach, inert Daimios--the Commodore will _not_ go to Nagasaki, and"
1619,PART II,the roar of his guns will drown the clattering fall of your Dragon
1620,PART II,"Doors if you do not open them in time.  East and West, and trade"
1621,PART II,"shaded by heroism.  Hokusai is dead, but his pupils are lampooning"

1623,PART II,"Appoint two Princes to receive the Commodore, at once, since he will"

1627,PART II,Flip--flap--flutter--flags in front of the Conference House.  Built
1628,PART II,"over night, it seems, with unpainted peaked summits of roofs gleaming"

1630,PART II,a crescent about nine tall standards whose long scarlet pennons brush
1631,PART II,the ground.  Beat--tap--fill and relapse--the wind pushing against
1632,PART II,"taut white cloth screens, bellying out the Shōgun's crest of"
1633,PART II,"heart-shaped Asarum leaves in the panels, crumpling them to"

1636,PART II,"Sword-bearers, spear-bearers, archers, lancers, and those who carry"

2243,ROME,The blue sky of Italy; the blue sky of Rome.  Sunlight pouring white
2244,ROME,and clear from the wide-stretched sky.  Sunlight sliding softly over
2245,ROME,"white marble, lying in jasmine circles before cool porticoes,"
2246,ROME,"striking sharply upon roofs and domes, recoiling before straight"
2247,ROME,"façades of grey granite, foiled and beaten by the deep halls of"
2248,ROME,temples.
2249,ROME,
2250,ROME,"Sunlight on tiles and tufa, sunlight on basalt and porphyry.  The sky"
2251,ROME,"stripes Rome with sun and shadow; strips of yellow, strips of blue,"
2252,ROME,pepper-dots of purple and orange.  It whip-lashes the four great
2253,ROME,"horses of gilded bronze, harnessed to the bronze _quadriga_ on the"
2254,ROME,"Arch of Nero, and they trot slowly forward without moving.  The"
2255,ROME,horses tread the marbles of Rome beneath their feet.  Their golden
2256,ROME,"flanks quiver in the sunlight.  One foot paws the air.  A step, and"
2257,ROME,"they will lance into the air, Pegasus-like, stepping the wind.  But"
2258,ROME,"they do not take the step.  They wait--poised, treading Rome as they"
2259,ROME,"trod Alexandria, as they trod the narrow Island of Cos.  The spokes"
2260,ROME,"of the _quadriga_ wheels flash, but they do not turn.  They burn like"
2261,ROME,"day-stars above the Arch of Nero.  The horses poise over Rome, a"
2262,ROME,"constellation of morning, triumphant above Emperors, proud,"
2263,ROME,"indifferent, enduring, relentlessly spurning the hot dust of Rome."
2264,ROME,"Hot dust clouds up about them, but not one particle sticks to their"
2265,ROME,"gilded manes.  Dust is nothing, a mere smoke of disappearing hours."
2266,ROME,"Slowly they trot forward without moving, and time passes and passes"

2268,ROME,
2269,ROME,"People go and come in the streets of Rome, shuffling over the basalt"
2270,ROME,"paving-stones in their high latcheted sandals.  White and purple,"
2271,ROME,"like the white sun and the purple shadows, the senators pass,"
2272,ROME,followed by a crowd of slaves.  Waves of brown-coated populace efface
2273,ROME,"themselves before a litter, carried by eight Cappadocians in"
2274,ROME,"light-red tunics; as it moves along, there is the flicker of a violet"
2275,ROME,"_stola_ and the blowing edge of a palla of sky-white blue.  A lady,"
2276,ROME,going to the bath to lie for an hour in the crimson and wine-red
2277,ROME,"reflections of a marble chamber, to glide over a floor of green and"
2278,ROME,"white stones into a Carraran basin, where the green and blue water"

2280,ROME,"Claudia, Aqua Virgo, Aqua Marcia, drawn from the hills to lie against"

2283,ROME,as a lark drops notes backwards into the sky.  The lady lies against
2284,ROME,"the lipping water, supine and indolent, a pomegranate, a"
2285,ROME,"passion-flower, a silver-flamed lily, lapped, slapped, lulled, by the"
2286,ROME,ripples which stir under her faintly moving hands.

2288,ROME,"Later, beneath a painting of twelve dancing girls upon a gold ground,"

2294,ROME,Legionaries ravish Egypt for her entertainment; they bring her roses

2306,ROME,"at a street corner, and the oaths of the drivers mingle, and snap,"
2307,ROME,"and corrode, like hot fused metal, one against another.  They hiss"
2308,ROME,"and sputter, making a confused chord through which the squeal of a"
2309,ROME,"derrick winding up a granite slab pierces, shrill and nervous, a"
2310,ROME,"sharp boring sound, shoring through the wide, white light of the"
2311,ROME,"Roman sky.  People are selling things: matches, broken glass, peas,"
2312,ROME,"sausages, cakes.  A string of donkeys, with panniers loaded with red"
2313,ROME,"asparagus and pale-green rue, minces past the derrick, the donkeys"
2314,ROME,"squeeze, one by one, with little patting feet, between the derrick"
2315,ROME,"and the choked crossing.  ""Hey!  Gallus, have you heard that Cæsar"
2316,ROME,has paid a million _sestertii_ for a Murrhine vase.  It is green and

2326,ROME,"casting orange and purple striæ down upon the marble city, cool and"
2327,ROME,"majestic, between cool hills, white and omnipotent, dying of languor,"
2328,ROME,amusing herself for a moment with the little boats floating up the
2329,ROME,"Tiber bringing the good grain of Carthage, then relaxed and falling"
2330,ROME,"as water falls, dropping into the bath.  Weak as water; without"
2331,ROME,"contour as water; colourless as water; Rome bathes, and relaxes, and"
2332,ROME,"melts.  Fluid and fluctuating, a liquid city pouring itself back into"
2333,ROME,"the streams of the earth.  And above, on the Arch of Nero, hard,"
2334,ROME,"metallic, firm, cold, and permanent, the bronze horses trot slowly,"
2335,ROME,"not moving, and the moon casts the fine-edged shadow of them down"
2336,ROME,upon the paving-stones.
2337,ROME,
2338,ROME,
2339,ROME,"Hills of the city: Pincian, Esquiline, Cælian, Aventine, the crimson"
2340,ROME,"tip of the sun burns against you, and you start into sudden clearness"
2341,ROME,"and glow red, red-gold, saffron, gradually diminishing to an outline"
2342,ROME,"of blue.  The sun mounts over Rome, and the Arch of Augustus glitters"
2343,ROME,"like a cleft pomegranate; the Temples of Julius Cæsar, Castor, and"
2344,ROME,"Saturn, turn carbuncle, and rose, and diamond.  Columns divide into"
2345,ROME,"double edges of flash and shadow; domes glare, inverted beryls"
2346,ROME,hanging over arrested scintillations.  The fountains flake and fringe
2347,ROME,with the scatter of the sun.  The mosaic floors of _atriums_ are no
2348,ROME,"longer stone, but variegated fire; higher, on the walls, the pictures"
2349,ROME,"painted in the white earth of Melos, the red earth of Sinope, the"
2350,ROME,"yellow ochre of Attica, erupt into flame.  The legs of satyrs jerk"
2351,ROME,"with desire, the dancers whirl in torch-bright involutions.  Grapes"
2352,ROME,"split and burst, spurting spots and sparks of sun."
2353,ROME,
2354,ROME,"It is morning in Rome, and the bronze horses on the Arch of Nero trot"
2355,ROME,"quietly forward without moving, but no one can see them, they are"
2356,ROME,"only a dazzle, a shock of stronger light against the white-blue sky."
2357,ROME,
2358,ROME,"Morning in Rome; and the whole city foams out to meet it, seething,"
2359,ROME,"simmering, surging, seeping.  All between the Janiculum and the"
2360,ROME,"Palatine is undulating with people.  Scarlet, violet, and purple"
2361,ROME,togas pattern the mass of black and brown.  Murex-dyed silk dresses
2362,ROME,"flow beside raw woollen fabrics.  The altars smoke incense, the"
2363,ROME,"bridges shake under the caking mass of sight-seers.  ""Titus!  Titus!"
2364,ROME,"_Io triumphe!_""  Even now the troops are collected near the Temple of"
2365,ROME,"Apollo, outside the gates, waiting for the signal to march.  In the"
2366,ROME,"parching Roman morning, the hot dust rises and clouds over the"
2367,ROME,city--an aureole of triumph.  The horses on the Arch of Nero paw the
2368,ROME,"golden dust, but it passes, passes, brushing along their burnished"
2369,ROME,sides like wind.
2370,ROME,
2371,ROME,
2372,ROME,What is that sound?  The marble city shivers to the treading of feet.
2373,ROME,"Cæsar's legions marching, foot--foot--hundreds, thousands of feet."
2374,ROME,"They beat the ground, rounding each step double."
2375,ROME,"Coming--coming--cohort after cohort, with brazen trumpets marking the"
2376,ROME,"time.  One--two--one--two--laurel-crowned each one of you,"
2377,ROME,"cactus-fibred, harsh as sand grinding the rocks of a treeless land,"
2378,ROME,"rough and salt as a Dead Sea wind, only the fallen are left behind."
2379,ROME,"Blood-red plumes, jarring to the footfalls; they have passed through"
2380,ROME,"the gate, they are in the walls of the mother city, of marble Rome."
2381,ROME,"Their tunics are purple embroidered with gold, their armour clanks as"
2382,ROME,"they walk, the cold steel of their swords is chill in the sun, each"
2383,ROME,"is a hero, one by one, endless companies, the soldiers come.  Back to"
2384,ROME,"Rome with a victor's spoils, with a victor's wreath on every head,"
2385,ROME,"and Judah broken is dead, dead!  ""_Io triumphe!_""  The shout knocks"
2386,ROME,and breaks upon the spears of the legionaries.
2387,ROME,
2388,ROME,"The God of the Jews is overborne, he has failed his people.  See the"

2392,ROME,"Juno, and Minerva, and the rest, those gods are the best who bring"
2393,ROME,victory!  And the beasts they have over there!  Is that a crocodile?
2394,ROME,"And that bird with a tail as long as a banner, what do you call that?"
2395,ROME,"Look at the elephants, and the dromedaries!  They are harnessed in"
2396,ROME,"jewels.  Oh!  Oh!  The beautiful sight!  Here come the prisoners,"
2397,ROME,"dirty creatures.  ""That's a good-looking girl there.  I have rather a"
2398,ROME,"fancy for a Jewess.  I'll get her, by Bacchus, if I have to mortgage"
2399,ROME,"my farm.  A man too, of course, to keep the breed going; it will be a"
2400,ROME,"good investment, although, to be sure, I want the girl myself."
2401,ROME,"Castor and Pollux, did you see that picture!  Ten men disembowelled"
2402,ROME,on the steps of the altar.  That is better than a gladiator show any
2403,ROME,"day.  I wish I had been there.  Simon, oh, Simon!  Spit at him,"
2404,ROME,"Lucullus.  Thumbs down for Simon!  Fancy getting him alive, I wonder"
2405,ROME,"he didn't kill himself first like Cleopatra.  This is a glorious day,"
2406,ROME,"I haven't had such fun in years."""

2409,ROME,The bronze horses tread quietly above the triumphing multitudes.
2410,ROME,"They too have been spoils of war, yet they stand here on the Arch of"
2411,ROME,"Nero dominating Rome.  Time passes--passes--but the horses, calm and"
2412,ROME,"contained, move forward, dividing one minute from another and leaving"
2413,ROME,each behind.
2414,ROME,
2415,ROME,
2416,ROME,"You should be still now, Roman populace.  These are the decorations"
2417,ROME,"of the Penetralia, the holy Sanctuary which your soldiers have"
2418,ROME,"profaned.  But the people jeer and scoff, and comment on the queer"
2419,ROME,articles carried on the heads of the soldiers.  Tragedy indeed!  They
2420,ROME,"see no tragedy, only an immense spectacle, unique and satisfying."
2421,ROME,"The crowd clears its throat and spits and shouts ""_Io triumphe!  Io"
2422,ROME,"triumphe!_"" against the cracking blare of brazen trumpets."
2423,ROME,
2424,ROME,"Slowly they come, the symbols of a beaten religion: the Golden Table"
2425,ROME,"for the Shew-Bread, the Silver Trumpets that sounded the Jubilee, the"
2426,ROME,"Seven-Branched Candlestick, the very Tables of the Law which Moses"
2427,ROME,brought down from Mount Sinai.  Can Jupiter conquer these?  Slowly
2428,ROME,"they pass, glinting in the sunlight, staring in the light of day,"
2429,ROME,"mocked and exhibited.  Lord God of Hosts, fall upon these people,"
2430,ROME,"send your thunders upon them, hurl the lightnings of your wrath"
2431,ROME,"against this multitude, raze their marble city so that not one stone"
2432,ROME,"remain standing.  But the sun shines unclouded, and the holy vessels"
2433,ROME,"pass onward through the Campus Martius, through the Circus Flaminius,"
2434,ROME,"up the Via Sacra to the Capitol, and then...  The bronze horses look"
2435,ROME,"into the brilliant sky, they trot slowly without moving, they advance"
2436,ROME,"slowly, one foot raised.  There is always another step--one, and"
2437,ROME,"another.  How many does not matter, so that each is taken."
2438,ROME,
2439,ROME,
2440,ROME,The _spolia opima_ have passed.  The crowd holds its breath and
2441,ROME,quivers.  Everyone is tiptoed up to see above his neighbour; they
2442,ROME,"sway and brace themselves in their serried ranks.  Away, over the"
2443,ROME,"heads, silver eagles glitter, each one marking the passage of a"
2444,ROME,"legion.  The ""Victorious Legion"" goes by, the ""Indomitable Legion,"""
2445,ROME,"the ""Spanish Legion,"" and those with a crested lark on their helmets,"
2446,ROME,and that other whose centurions are almost smothered under the
2447,ROME,shining reflections of the medallions fastened to their armour.
2448,ROME,"Cohort after cohort, legion on the heels of legion, the glistening"
2449,ROME,"greaves rise and flash and drop and pale, scaling from sparkle to"
2450,ROME,"dullness in a series of rhythmic angles, constantly repeated.  They"
2451,ROME,"swing to the tones of straight brass trumpets, they jut out and fall"
2452,ROME,"at the call of spiral bugles.  Above them, the pointed shields move"
2453,ROME,"evenly, right to left--right to left.  The horses curvet and prance,"
2454,ROME,"and shiver back, checked, on their haunches; the javelins of the"
2455,ROME,horsemen are so many broad-ended sticks of flame.
2456,ROME,
2457,ROME,"Those are the eagles of the Imperial Guard, and behind are two golden"
2458,ROME,"chariots.  ""_Io triumphe!_""  The roar drowns the trumpets and bugles,"
2459,ROME,the clatter of the horses' hoofs is a mere rattle of sand ricocheting
2460,ROME,against the voice of welcoming Rome.  The Emperor Vespasian rides in
2461,ROME,"one chariot, in the other stands Titus.  Titus, who has subdued"
2462,ROME,"Judea, who has humbled Jehovah, and brought the sacred vessels of the"
2463,ROME,Lord God of Hosts back with him as a worthy offering to the people of
2464,ROME,"Rome.  Cheer, therefore, good people, you have the Throne of Heaven"
2465,ROME,to recline upon; you are possessed of the awful majesty of the God of
2466,ROME,the Jews; beneath your feet are spread the emblems of the Most High;
2467,ROME,and your hands are made free of the sacred instruments of Salvation.
2468,ROME,
2469,ROME,What god is that who falls before pikes and spears!  Here is another
2470,ROME,"god, his face and hands stained with vermilion, after the manner of"
2471,ROME,"the Capitoline Jupiter.  His car is of ivory and gold, green plumes"
2472,ROME,"nod over the heads of his horses, the military bracelets on his arms"
2473,ROME,seem like circling serpents of bitter flame.  The milk-white horses
2474,ROME,"draw him slowly to the Capitol, step by step, along the Via"
2475,ROME,"Triumphalis, and step by step the old golden horses on the Arch of"
2476,ROME,Nero tread down the hours of the lapsing day.
2477,ROME,
2478,ROME,
2479,ROME,"That night, forty elephants bearing candelabra light up the ranges of"

2481,ROME,illuminated elephants--and the light of their candles is reflected in
2482,ROME,"the polished sides of the great horses, above, on the Arch of Nero,"
2483,ROME,"slowly trotting forward, stationary yet moving, in the soft night"

2510,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2511,CONSTANTINOPLE,Empire of the East!  Byzantium!  Constantinople!  The Golden City of
2512,CONSTANTINOPLE,the World.  A crystal fixed in aquamarines; a jewel-box set down in a
2513,CONSTANTINOPLE,"seaside garden.  All the seas are as blue as Spring lupins, and there"
2514,CONSTANTINOPLE,"are so many seas.  Look where you please, forward, back, or down,"
2515,CONSTANTINOPLE,"there is water.  The deep blue water of crisp ripples, the long light"
2516,CONSTANTINOPLE,"shimmer of flat undulations, the white glare, smoothing into purple,"
2517,CONSTANTINOPLE,of a sun-struck ebb.  The Bosphorus winds North to the Black Sea.
2518,CONSTANTINOPLE,The Golden Horn curves into the Sweet Waters.  The edge of the city
2519,CONSTANTINOPLE,"swerves away from the Sea of Marmora.  Aquamarines, did I say?"
2520,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Sapphires, beryls, lapis-lazuli, amethysts, and felspar.  Whatever"
2521,CONSTANTINOPLE,"stones there are, bluer than gentians, bluer than cornflowers, bluer"
2522,CONSTANTINOPLE,"than asters, bluer than periwinkles.  So blue that the city must be"
2523,CONSTANTINOPLE,"golden to complement the water.  A geld city, shimmering and"
2524,CONSTANTINOPLE,"simmering, starting up like mica from the green of lemon trees, and"
2525,CONSTANTINOPLE,"olives, and cypresses."
2526,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2527,CONSTANTINOPLE,Gold!  Gold!  Walls and columns covered with gold.  Domes of churches
2528,CONSTANTINOPLE,"resplendent with gold.  Innumerable statues of ""bronze fairer than"
2529,CONSTANTINOPLE,"pure gold,"" and courts paved with golden tiles.  Beyond the white and"
2530,CONSTANTINOPLE,"rose-coloured walls of Saint Sophia, the city rounds for fourteen"
2531,CONSTANTINOPLE,"great miles; fourteen miles of onychite, and porphyry, and marble;"
2532,CONSTANTINOPLE,"fourteen miles of colonnades, and baths, and porticoes; fourteen"
2533,CONSTANTINOPLE,"miles of gay, garish, gaudy, glaring gold.  Why, even the Imperial"
2534,CONSTANTINOPLE,"_triremes_ in the harbour have gold embroidered gonfalons, and the"
2535,CONSTANTINOPLE,"dolphins, ruffling out of the water between them, catch the colour"
2536,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and dive, each a sharp cutting disk-edge of yellow flame."
2537,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2538,CONSTANTINOPLE,"It is the same up above, where statues spark like stars jutted from a"
2539,CONSTANTINOPLE,"mid-day sky.  There are golden Emperors at every crossing, and golden"

2541,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Hippodrome, facing the _triremes_ and the leaping dolphins, is a fine"
2542,CONSTANTINOPLE,chariot of Corinthian brass.  Four horses harnessed to a gilded

2544,CONSTANTINOPLE,"trampling upon space, facing out to sea on the currents of the"

2546,CONSTANTINOPLE,"they pause, one leg uplifted, seized and baffled by the arrested"
2547,CONSTANTINOPLE,"movement.  They are the horses of Constantine, brought from Rome, so"
2548,CONSTANTINOPLE,"people say, buzzing in the Augustaion.  ""Fine horses, hey?""  ""A good"

2559,CONSTANTINOPLE,dropping away altogether and going to sleep in a plane-tree behind
2560,CONSTANTINOPLE,the Hippodrome.

2562,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2563,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Constantinople is a yellow honey-comb, with fat bees buzzing in all"

2565,CONSTANTINOPLE,"humming from the Steppes of Tartary, from the long line of Nile-fed"
2566,CONSTANTINOPLE,Egypt.  Tush!  What would you!  Where there is gold there are always
2567,CONSTANTINOPLE,"men about it; to steal it, to guard it, to sit and rot under its"
2568,CONSTANTINOPLE,lotus-shining brilliance.  The very army is woven of threads drawn
2569,CONSTANTINOPLE,"from the edges of the world.  Byzantines are merchantmen, they roll"
2570,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and flounder in the midst of gold coins, they tumble and wallow in"
2571,CONSTANTINOPLE,"money-baths, they sit and chuckle under a continuous money-spray."
2572,CONSTANTINOPLE,"And ringed about them is the army, paid to shovel back the scattering"
2573,CONSTANTINOPLE,gold pieces: Dalmatians with swords and arrows; Macedonians with
2574,CONSTANTINOPLE,"silver belts and gilt shields; Scholarii, clad in rose-coloured"
2575,CONSTANTINOPLE,"tunics; Varangians, shouldering double battle-axes.  When they walk,"
2576,CONSTANTINOPLE,the rattle of them can be heard pattering back from every wall and
2577,CONSTANTINOPLE,"doorway.  It clacks and cracks even in the Copper Market, above the"
2578,CONSTANTINOPLE,clang of cooking pots and the wrangling whine of Jewish traders.
2579,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Constantinople chatters, buzzes, screams, growls, howls, squeals,"

2586,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2587,CONSTANTINOPLE,People pluck the strings of rebecks and psalteries; they shock the
2588,CONSTANTINOPLE,"cords of lyres; they batter tin drums, and shatter the guts of"
2589,CONSTANTINOPLE,kettle-drums when the Emperor goes to Saint Sophia to worship at an
2590,CONSTANTINOPLE,"altar of precious stones fused into a bed of gold and silver, and, as"
2591,CONSTANTINOPLE,"he walks up the nave between the columns of green granite, and the"
2592,CONSTANTINOPLE,"columns of porphyry, under the golden lily on the Octagonal Tower,"
2593,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the bells pour their notes over the roofs, spilling them in single"
2594,CONSTANTINOPLE,jets down on each side of the wide roofs.  Drip--drip--drip--out of
2595,CONSTANTINOPLE,"their hearts of beaten bronze, slipping and drowning in the noise of"
2596,CONSTANTINOPLE,the crowds clustered below.
2597,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2598,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2599,CONSTANTINOPLE,"On the top of the Hippodrome, the bronze horses trot toward the"

2601,CONSTANTINOPLE,"them, the spokes of the _quadriga_ wheels remain separate and single,"
2602,CONSTANTINOPLE,with the blue sky showing between each one.

2604,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2605,CONSTANTINOPLE,"What a city is this, builded of gold and alabaster, with myrtle and"

2608,CONSTANTINOPLE,fountains flow from the beaks of silver eagles.  All this splendour
2609,CONSTANTINOPLE,"cooped within the fourteen miles of a single city, forsooth!  In"
2610,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Britain, they sit under oaken beams; in France, they eat with"
2611,CONSTANTINOPLE,"hunting-knives; in Germany, men wear coats of their wives' weaving."
2612,CONSTANTINOPLE,In Italy--but there is a Pope in Italy!  The bronze horses pause on
2613,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the marble Hippodrome, and days blow over them, brushing their sides"

2615,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2616,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2617,CONSTANTINOPLE,"It is May eleventh in Constantinople, and the Spring-blue sea shivers"
2618,CONSTANTINOPLE,like a field of lupins run over by a breeze.  Every tree and shrub
2619,CONSTANTINOPLE,spouted over every garden-wall flouts a chromatic sequence of greens.
2620,CONSTANTINOPLE,"A long string of camels on the Bridge of Justinian moves, black and"
2621,CONSTANTINOPLE,"ostrich-like, against the sheen of water.  A swallow sheers past the"
2622,CONSTANTINOPLE,bronze horses and drops among the pillars on top of the curve of the
2623,CONSTANTINOPLE,Hippodrome; the great cistern on the Spina reflects a speckless sky.
2624,CONSTANTINOPLE,"It is race-day in Constantinople, and the town is turned out upon the"
2625,CONSTANTINOPLE,"benches of the Hippodrome, waiting for the procession to begin."
2626,CONSTANTINOPLE,"""Hola!  You fellows on the top tier, do you see anything?""  ""Nothing"

2633,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2634,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Away beyond, through the gates, flageolets are squealing, and"
2635,CONSTANTINOPLE,trumpets are splitting their brass throats and choking over the
2636,CONSTANTINOPLE,sound.  Patter--patter--patter--horses' hoofs on flagstones.  They
2637,CONSTANTINOPLE,are coming under the paved arch.  There is the President of the Games
2638,CONSTANTINOPLE,in a tunic embroidered with golden palm-branches; there is the
2639,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Emperor in his pearl-lappeted cap, and his vermilion buskins; and"
2640,CONSTANTINOPLE,"here are the racers--Green--Blue--driving their chariots, easily"
2641,CONSTANTINOPLE,standing in their high-wheeled chariots.  The sun whitens the knives
2642,CONSTANTINOPLE,"in their girdles, the reins flash in the sun like ribbons of spun"
2643,CONSTANTINOPLE,"glass.  Three-year-olds in the Green chariot, so black they are blue."
2644,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Four blue-black horses, with the sheen of their flanks glistening"
2645,CONSTANTINOPLE,"like the grain of polished wood.  The little ears point forward,"
2646,CONSTANTINOPLE,"their teeth tease the bits.  They snort and jerk, and the chariot"
2647,CONSTANTINOPLE,"wheels quirk over an outstanding stone and jolt down, flat and"
2648,CONSTANTINOPLE,"rumbling.  The Blue chariot-driver handles a team of greys, white as"
2649,CONSTANTINOPLE,the storks who nest in the cemetery beyond the Moslem quarter.  He
2650,CONSTANTINOPLE,"gathers up his reins, and the horses fall back against the pole,"
2651,CONSTANTINOPLE,"clattering, then fling forward, meet the bit, rear up, and swing"
2652,CONSTANTINOPLE,"inward, settling gradually into a nervous jigging as they follow"
2653,CONSTANTINOPLE,"round the course.  ""Blue!  Blue!  Go for him, Blue!"" from the North"
2654,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Corner.  ""Hurrah for the Blue!  Blue to Eternity!""  Slowly the"
2655,CONSTANTINOPLE,"procession winds round the Spina, and the crowd stands up on the"
2656,CONSTANTINOPLE,"seats and yells and cheers and waves handkerchiefs, sixty thousand"
2657,CONSTANTINOPLE,voices making such a noise that only the high screaming of the
2658,CONSTANTINOPLE,"flageolets can be heard above it.  The horses toss and twitch, the"
2659,CONSTANTINOPLE,"harness jingles, and the gilded eggs and dolphins on the Spina"
2660,CONSTANTINOPLE,coruscate in versicoloured stars.
2661,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2662,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2663,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Above the Emperor's balcony, the bronze horses move quietly forward,"
2664,CONSTANTINOPLE,and the sun outlines the great muscles of their lifted legs.
2665,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2666,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2667,CONSTANTINOPLE,"They have reached the Grand Stand again, and the chariots are shut"
2668,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and barred in their stalls.  The multitude, rustling as though they"
2669,CONSTANTINOPLE,"were paper being folded, settles down into their seats.  The"
2670,CONSTANTINOPLE,"President drops a napkin, the bars are unlocked, and the chariots in"
2671,CONSTANTINOPLE,"a double rush take the straight at top speed, Blue leading, Green"
2672,CONSTANTINOPLE,saving up for the turn at the curve.  Round the three cones at the
2673,CONSTANTINOPLE,"end, Blue on one wheel, Green undercutting him.  Blue turns wide to"
2674,CONSTANTINOPLE,"right himself, takes the outside course and flashes up the long edge"
2675,CONSTANTINOPLE,so that you cannot count two till he curves again.  Down to the Green
2676,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Corner, Blue's off horses slipping just before the cones, one hits"
2677,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the pole, loses balance and falls, drags a moment, catches his feet"
2678,CONSTANTINOPLE,"as the chariot slows for the circle, gathers, plunges, and lunges up"
2679,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and on, while the Greens on the benches groan and curse.  But the"
2680,CONSTANTINOPLE,"black team is worse off, the inside near colt has got his leg over a"
2681,CONSTANTINOPLE,"trace.  Green checks his animals, the horse kicks free, but Blue"
2682,CONSTANTINOPLE,"licks past him on the up way, and is ahead at the North turn by a"
2683,CONSTANTINOPLE,"wheel length.  Green goes round, flogging to make up time.  Two eggs"
2684,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and dolphins gone, three more to go.  The pace has been slow so far,"
2685,CONSTANTINOPLE,"now they must brace up.  Bets run high, screamed out above the rumble"
2686,CONSTANTINOPLE,"of the chariots.  ""Ten on the Green.""  ""Odds fifty for the Blue."""
2687,CONSTANTINOPLE,"""Double mine; those greys have him.""  ""The blacks, the blacks, lay"
2688,CONSTANTINOPLE,"you a hundred to one the blacks beat.""  Down, round, up, round, down,"
2689,CONSTANTINOPLE,"so fast they are only dust puffs, one can scarcely see which is"
2690,CONSTANTINOPLE,"which.  The horses are badly blown now, and the drivers yell to them,"
2691,CONSTANTINOPLE,and thrash their churning flanks.  The course is wet with sweat and
2692,CONSTANTINOPLE,"blood, the wheels slide over the wet course.  Green negotiates the"
2693,CONSTANTINOPLE,South curve with his chariot sideways; Blue skids over to the flagged
2694,CONSTANTINOPLE,"way and lames a horse on the stones.  The Emperor is on his feet,"
2695,CONSTANTINOPLE,staring through his emerald spy-glass.  Once more round for the last
2696,CONSTANTINOPLE,"egg and dolphin.  Down for the last time, Blue's lame horse delays"
2697,CONSTANTINOPLE,"him, but he flays him with the whip and the Green Corner finds them"
2698,CONSTANTINOPLE,"abreast.  The Greens on the seats burst upstanding.  ""Too far out!"
2699,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Well turned!""  ""The Green's got it!""  ""Well done, Hirpinus!""  The"
2700,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Green driver disappears up the long side to the goal, waving his"
2701,CONSTANTINOPLE,"right hand, but Blue's lame horse staggers, stumbles, and goes down,"
2702,CONSTANTINOPLE,"settling into the dust with a moan.  Vortex of dust, struggling"

2708,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2709,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2710,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Cool and imperturbable, the four great gilt horses slowly pace above"
2711,CONSTANTINOPLE,the marble columns of the Grand Stand.  They gaze out upon the
2712,CONSTANTINOPLE,lupin-blue water beyond the Southern curve.  Can they see the Island
2713,CONSTANTINOPLE,"of Corfu from up there, do you think?  There are vessels at the"
2714,CONSTANTINOPLE,Island of Corfu waiting to continue a journey.  The great horses trot
2715,CONSTANTINOPLE,"forward without moving, and the dust of the race-track sifts over"
2716,CONSTANTINOPLE,them and blows away.
2717,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2718,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2719,CONSTANTINOPLE,Constantinople from the Abbey of San Stefano: bubbles of opal and
2720,CONSTANTINOPLE,"amber thrust up in a distant sky, pigeon-coloured nebulæ closing the"
2721,CONSTANTINOPLE,"end of a long horizon.  Tilting to the little waves of a harbour, the"
2722,CONSTANTINOPLE,"good ships _Aquila_, _Paradiso_, _Pellegrina_, leaders of a fleet of"
2723,CONSTANTINOPLE,"galleys: _dromi_, _hippogogi_, vessels carrying timber for turrets,"
2724,CONSTANTINOPLE,strong vessels holding mangonels.  Proud vessels under an ancient
2725,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Doge, keeping Saint John's Day at the Abbey of San Stefano, within"
2726,CONSTANTINOPLE,sight of Constantinople.
2727,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2728,CONSTANTINOPLE,Knights in blue and crimson inlaid armour clank up and down the
2729,CONSTANTINOPLE,gang-planks of the vessels.  Flags and banners flap loosely at the
2730,CONSTANTINOPLE,"mast-heads.  There is the banner of Baldwin of Flanders, the standard"
2731,CONSTANTINOPLE,"of Louis of Blois, the oriflamme of Boniface of Montferrat, the"
2732,CONSTANTINOPLE,"pennon of Hugh, Count of Saint Paul, and last, greatest, the gonfalon"
2733,CONSTANTINOPLE,"of Saint Mark, dripped so low it almost touches the deck, with the"
2734,CONSTANTINOPLE,lion of Venice crumpled in its windless folds.
2735,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2736,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2737,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Saint John's Day, and High Mass in the Abbey of San Stefano.  They"
2738,CONSTANTINOPLE,need God's help who would pass over the double walls and the four
2739,CONSTANTINOPLE,hundred towers of Constantinople.  _Te Deum Laudamus!_  The armoured
2740,CONSTANTINOPLE,"knights make the sign of the cross, lightly touching the crimson and"
2741,CONSTANTINOPLE,azure devices on their breasts with mailed forefingers.
2742,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2743,CONSTANTINOPLE,"South wind to the rescue; that was a good mass.  ""Boatswain, what's"

2746,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2747,CONSTANTINOPLE,Fifty vessels making silver paths in the Summer-blue Sea of Marmora.
2748,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Fifty vessels passing the Sweet Waters, blowing up the Bosphorus."
2749,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2750,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Strike your raucous gongs, City of Byzantium.  Run about like ants"
2751,CONSTANTINOPLE,between your golden palaces.  These vessels are the chalices of God's
2752,CONSTANTINOPLE,wrath.  The spirit of Christ walking upon the waters.  Or is it
2753,CONSTANTINOPLE,anti-Christ?  This is the true Church.  Have we not the stone on
2754,CONSTANTINOPLE,"which Jacob slept, the rod which Moses turned into a serpent, a"
2755,CONSTANTINOPLE,portion of the bread of the Last Supper?  We are the Virgin's chosen
2756,CONSTANTINOPLE,"abiding place; why, the picture which Saint Luke painted of her is in"
2757,CONSTANTINOPLE,our keeping.  We have pulled the sun's rays from the statue of
2758,CONSTANTINOPLE,Constantine and put up the Cross instead.  Will that bring us
2759,CONSTANTINOPLE,"nothing?  Cluster round the pink and white striped churches, throng"
2760,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the alabaster churches, fill the naves with a sound of chanting."
2761,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Strike the terror-gongs and call out the soldiers, for even now the"
2762,CONSTANTINOPLE,"plumed knights are disembarking, and the snarling of their trumpets"
2763,CONSTANTINOPLE,mingles with the beating of the gongs.
2764,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2765,CONSTANTINOPLE,"The bronze horses on the Hippodrome, harnessed to the gilded"
2766,CONSTANTINOPLE,"_quadriga_, step forward slowly.  They proceed in a measured cadence."
2767,CONSTANTINOPLE,They advance without moving.  There are lights and agitation in the
2768,CONSTANTINOPLE,"city, but the air about the horses has the violet touch of night."
2769,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2770,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2771,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Now, now, you crossbowmen and archers, you go first.  Stand along the"
2772,CONSTANTINOPLE,"gunwales and be ready to jump.  Keep those horses still there, don't"
2773,CONSTANTINOPLE,let them get out of order.  Lucky we thought of the hides.  Their
2774,CONSTANTINOPLE,"damnable Greek fire can't hurt us now.  Up to the bridge, knights."
2775,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Three of you abreast, on a level with the towers.  What's a shower of"
2776,CONSTANTINOPLE,arrows against armour!  An honourable dint blotting out the head of a
2777,CONSTANTINOPLE,"heron, half a plume sheared off a helmet so that it leers cock-eyed"
2778,CONSTANTINOPLE,"through the press.  Tut!  Tut!  Little things, the way of war.  Jar,"
2779,CONSTANTINOPLE,"jolt, mud--the knights clash together like jumbled chess-men, then"
2780,CONSTANTINOPLE,leap over the bridges.
2781,CONSTANTINOPLE,Confusion--contusion--raps--bangs--lurches--blows--battle-axes
2782,CONSTANTINOPLE,"thumping on tin shields; bolts bumping against leathern bucklers.  ""A"

2785,CONSTANTINOPLE,"pelting, poking, panting, punching, parrying, pulling, prodding,"
2786,CONSTANTINOPLE,"puking, piling, passing, you never did see.  Stones pour out of the"
2787,CONSTANTINOPLE,"mangonels; arrows fly thick as mist.  Swords twist against swords,"
2788,CONSTANTINOPLE,"bill-hooks batter bill-hooks, staves rattle upon staves.  One, two,"
2789,CONSTANTINOPLE,"five men up a scaling ladder.  Chop down on the first, and he rolls"
2790,CONSTANTINOPLE,off the ladder with his skull in two halves; rip up the bowels of the
2791,CONSTANTINOPLE,"second, he drips off the ladder like an overturned pail.  But the"
2792,CONSTANTINOPLE,third catches his adversary between the legs with a pike and pitches
2793,CONSTANTINOPLE,him over as one would toss a truss of hay.  Way for the three ladder
2794,CONSTANTINOPLE,"men!  Their feet are on the tower, their plumes flower, argent and"
2795,CONSTANTINOPLE,"gold, above the muck of slaughter.  From the main truck of the ships"
2796,CONSTANTINOPLE,there is a constant seeping of Venetians over the walls of
2797,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Constantinople.  They flow into the city, they throw themselves upon"
2798,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the beleaguered city.  They smash her defenders, and crash her"
2799,CONSTANTINOPLE,soldiers to mere bits of broken metal.
2800,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2801,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Byzantines, Copts, Russians, Persians, Armenians, Moslems, the great"
2802,CONSTANTINOPLE,army of the Franks is knocking at the gates of your towers.  Open the
2803,CONSTANTINOPLE,"gates.  Open, open, or we will tear down your doors, and breach the"
2804,CONSTANTINOPLE,"triple thickness of your walls.  Seventeen burning boats indeed, and"
2805,CONSTANTINOPLE,have the Venetians no boat-hooks?  They make pretty fireworks to
2806,CONSTANTINOPLE,pleasure our knights of an evening when they come to sup with Doge
2807,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Dandolo.  At night we will sleep, but in the morning we will kill"
2808,CONSTANTINOPLE,"again.  Under your tents, helmeted knights; into your cabin, old"
2809,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Doge.  The stars glitter in the Sea of Marmora, and above the city,"
2810,CONSTANTINOPLE,"black in the brilliance of the stars, the great horses of Constantine"
2811,CONSTANTINOPLE,"advance, pausing, blotting their shadows against the sprinkled sky."
2812,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2813,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2814,CONSTANTINOPLE,"From June until September, the fracas goes on.  The chanting of"
2815,CONSTANTINOPLE,"masses, the shouting of battle songs, sweep antiphonally over"
2816,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Constantinople.  They blend and blur, but what is that light"
2817,CONSTANTINOPLE,tinkling?  Tambourines?  What is that snapping?  Castanets?  What is
2818,CONSTANTINOPLE,that yellow light in the direction of the Saracen mosque?  My God!
2819,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Fire!  Gold of metals, you have met your king.  Ringed and crowned,"
2820,CONSTANTINOPLE,he takes his place in the jewelled city.  Gold of fire mounted upon
2821,CONSTANTINOPLE,all the lesser golds.  The twin tongues of flame flaunt above the
2822,CONSTANTINOPLE,"housetops.  Banners of scarlet, spears of saffron, spikes of rose and"
2823,CONSTANTINOPLE,melted orange.  What are the little flags of the Crusaders to these!
2824,CONSTANTINOPLE,They clamoured for pay and won the elements.  Over the Peninsula of
2825,CONSTANTINOPLE,Marmora it comes.  The whips of its fire-thongs lash the golden city.
2826,CONSTANTINOPLE,"A conflagration half a league wide.  Magnificent churches, splendid"
2827,CONSTANTINOPLE,"palaces, great commercial streets, are burning.  Golden domes melt"
2828,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and liquefy, and people flee from the dripping of them.  Lakes of"
2829,CONSTANTINOPLE,"gold lie upon the pavements; pillars crack and tumble, making dams"
2830,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and bridges over the hot gold.  Two days, two nights, the fire rages,"
2831,CONSTANTINOPLE,and through the roar of it the little cries of frightened birds come
2832,CONSTANTINOPLE,thin and pitiful.  Earth pleading with fire.  Earth begging quarter
2833,CONSTANTINOPLE,of the awful majesty of fire.  The birds wheel over Constantinople;
2834,CONSTANTINOPLE,they perch upon the cool bronze horses standing above the Hippodrome.
2835,CONSTANTINOPLE,"The quiet horses who wait and advance.  This is not their fire, they"
2836,CONSTANTINOPLE,"trample on the luminousness of flames, their strong hind legs plant"
2837,CONSTANTINOPLE,them firmly on the marble coping.  They watch the falling of the
2838,CONSTANTINOPLE,"fire, they gaze upon the ruins spread about them, and the pungence of"
2839,CONSTANTINOPLE,charred wood brushes along their tarnished sides like wind.
2840,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2841,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2842,CONSTANTINOPLE,The Franks have made an Emperor and now the Greeks have murdered him.
2843,CONSTANTINOPLE,The Doge asks for fifty _centenaria_ in gold to pay his sailors.  Who
2844,CONSTANTINOPLE,"will pay, now that the Emperor is dead?  Declare a siege and pay"
2845,CONSTANTINOPLE,"yourselves, Count, and Marquis, and Doge.  Set your ships bow to"
2846,CONSTANTINOPLE,"stern, a half a league of them.  Sail up the Golden Horn, and attack"
2847,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the walls in a hundred places.  You fail to-day, but you will win"
2848,CONSTANTINOPLE,to-morrow.  Bring up your battering-rams and ballistæ; hurl stones
2849,CONSTANTINOPLE,from your mangonels; run up your scaling ladders and across your skin
2850,CONSTANTINOPLE,bridges.  Winter is over and Spring is in your veins.  Your blood
2851,CONSTANTINOPLE,"mounts like sap, mount up the ladder after it.  Two ships to a tower,"
2852,CONSTANTINOPLE,and four towers taken.  Three gates battered in.  The city falls.
2853,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Cruel saints, you have betrayed your votaries.  Even the relic of the"
2854,CONSTANTINOPLE,Virgin's dress in the Panhagia of Blachernæ has been useless.  The
2855,CONSTANTINOPLE,"knights enter Byzantium, and their flickering pennants are the"
2856,CONSTANTINOPLE,flamelets of a new conflagration.  Fire of flesh burning in the blood
2857,CONSTANTINOPLE,"of the populace.  They would make the sign of the cross, would they,"
2858,CONSTANTINOPLE,so that the Franks may spare them?  But the sap is up in the Frankish
2859,CONSTANTINOPLE,"veins, the fire calls for fuel.  Blood burns to who will ignite it."
2860,CONSTANTINOPLE,"The swords itch for the taste of entrails, the lances twitch at sight"
2861,CONSTANTINOPLE,"of a Byzantine.  Feed, Fire!  Here are men, and women, and children,"
2862,CONSTANTINOPLE,"full of blood for the relish of your weapons.  Spring sap, how many"
2863,CONSTANTINOPLE,women!  Good Frankish seed for the women of Byzantium.  Blood and
2864,CONSTANTINOPLE,"lust, you shall empty yourselves upon the city.  Your swords shall"
2865,CONSTANTINOPLE,exhaust themselves upon these Greeks.  Your hands shall satisfy
2866,CONSTANTINOPLE,themselves with gold.  Spit at the priests.  This is the Greek
2867,CONSTANTINOPLE,"church, not ours.  Grab the sacred furniture of the churches,"
2868,CONSTANTINOPLE,"fornicate upon the high altar of Saint Sophia, and load the jewels"
2869,CONSTANTINOPLE,upon the donkeys you have driven into the church to receive them.
2870,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Old pagan Crusaders, this is the Orgy of Spring!  Lust and blood, the"
2871,CONSTANTINOPLE,birthright of the world.
2872,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2873,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2874,CONSTANTINOPLE,"The bright, shining horses tread upon the clean coping of the"
2875,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Hippodrome, and the Sea of Marmora lies before them like a lupin"
2876,CONSTANTINOPLE,field run over by a breeze.
2877,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2878,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2879,CONSTANTINOPLE,"What are you now, Constantinople?  A sacked city; and the tale of"
2880,CONSTANTINOPLE,your plundering shall outdo the tale of your splendours for wonder.
2881,CONSTANTINOPLE,Three days they pillage you.  Burmese rubies rattle in the pockets of
2882,CONSTANTINOPLE,common soldiers.  The golden tree is hacked to bits and carried off
2883,CONSTANTINOPLE,by crossbowmen.  An infantry sergeant hiccoughs over the wine he
2884,CONSTANTINOPLE,drinks from an altar cup.  The knights live in palaces and dip their
2885,CONSTANTINOPLE,plumes under the arch of the Emperor's bed-chamber.
2886,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2887,CONSTANTINOPLE,"In the Sea of Marmora, the good ships _Aquila_, _Paradiso_,"
2888,CONSTANTINOPLE,_Pellegrina_ swing at anchor.  The _dromi_ and _hippogogi_ ride free
2889,CONSTANTINOPLE,and empty.  They bob to the horses high above them on the Hippodrome.
2890,CONSTANTINOPLE,They dance to the rhythmic beat of hammers floating out to them from
2891,CONSTANTINOPLE,the city of Constantinople.
2892,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2893,CONSTANTINOPLE,Throb--throb--a dying pulse counts its vibrations.  Throb--throb--and
2894,CONSTANTINOPLE,each stroke means a gobbet of gold.  They tear it down from the walls
2895,CONSTANTINOPLE,"and doors, they rip it from ceilings and pry it up from floors.  They"
2896,CONSTANTINOPLE,"chip it off altars, they rip it out of panels, they hew it from"
2897,CONSTANTINOPLE,"obelisks, they gouge it from enamels.  This is a death dance, a"
2898,CONSTANTINOPLE,"whirligig, a skeleton city footing a jig, a tarantella quirked to"
2899,CONSTANTINOPLE,hammer-stroke time; a corpse in motley ogling a crime.
2900,CONSTANTINOPLE,Tap--tap--tap--goes the pantomime.
2901,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2902,CONSTANTINOPLE,Grinning devils watch church cutting the throat of church.  Chuckling
2903,CONSTANTINOPLE,"gargoyles in France, in Britain, rub their stomachs and squeeze"
2904,CONSTANTINOPLE,themselves together in an ecstasy of delight.  Ho!  Ho!  Marquis
2905,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Boniface, Count Hugh, Sieur Louis.  What plunder do you carry home?"
2906,CONSTANTINOPLE,What relics do you bring to your Gothic cathedrals?  The head of
2907,CONSTANTINOPLE,Saint Clement?  The arm of John the Baptist?  A bit of the wood of
2908,CONSTANTINOPLE,"the True Cross?  Statues are only so much metal, but these are"
2909,CONSTANTINOPLE,"treasures worth fighting for.  Fighting, quotha!  Murdering,"
2910,CONSTANTINOPLE,"stealing.  The Pope will absolve you, only bring him home a tear of"
2911,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Christ, and you will see.  A tear of Christ!  _Eli, Eli, lama"
2912,CONSTANTINOPLE,"sabachthani!_  Oh, pitiful world!  Pitiful knights in your inlaid"
2913,CONSTANTINOPLE,"armour!  Pitiful Doge, preening himself in the Palace of Blachernæ!"
2914,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2915,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2916,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Above the despoiled city, the Corinthian horses trot calmly forward,"

2918,CONSTANTINOPLE,
2919,CONSTANTINOPLE,"People have blood, but statues have gold, and silver, and bronze."
2920,CONSTANTINOPLE,"Melt them!  Melt them!  ""Gee!  Haw!""  Guide the oxen carefully.  Four"
2921,CONSTANTINOPLE,oxen to drag the head of Juno to the furnace.  White oxen to
2922,CONSTANTINOPLE,transport Minerva; fawn-coloured oxen for the colossal Hercules of
2923,CONSTANTINOPLE,Lysippus.  Pour them into the furnaces so that they run out mere soft
2924,CONSTANTINOPLE,metal ripe for coining.  Two foot-sergeants get as much as a
2925,CONSTANTINOPLE,"horse-sergeant, and two horse-sergeants as much as a knight.  Flatten"
2926,CONSTANTINOPLE,"out Constantinople.  Raze her many standing statues, shave the"
2927,CONSTANTINOPLE,Augustaion to a stark stretch of paving-stones.  Melt the bones of
2928,CONSTANTINOPLE,"beauty, indomitable Crusaders, and pay the Venetians fifty thousand"

2992,VENICE,"Beautiful, faded city.  The sea wind has dimmed your Oriental"

3014,VENICE,"rests and glitters, holding her treasures lightly, taking them for"
3015,VENICE,"granted, chatting among the fringes, and tinkling sherbet spoons of"
3016,VENICE,an evening in the dark shadow of the Campanile.
3017,VENICE,
3018,VENICE,"Up from the flickering water, beyond the laced colonnades of the"
3019,VENICE,"Ducal Palace--golden bubbles, lung out upon a sky of ripe blue."
3020,VENICE,"Arches of white and scarlet flowers, pillars of porphyry, columns of"
3021,VENICE,"jasper, open loggias of deep-green serpentine flaked with snow.  In"
3022,VENICE,"the architraves, stones chipped and patterned, the blues studded with"
3023,VENICE,"greens, the greens circling round yellows, reds of every depth, clear"
3024,VENICE,"purples, heliotropes clouded into a vague white.  Above them, all"
3025,VENICE,"about them, the restless movement of carven stone; it is involuted"
3026,VENICE,"and grotesque, it is acanthus leaves and roses, it is palm branches"
3027,VENICE,"and vine tendrils, it is feathers and the tails of birds, all blowing"
3028,VENICE,on a day of _scirocco_.  Angels rise among the swirling acanthus
3029,VENICE,"leaves, angels and leaves weaving an upstarting line, ending in the"
3030,VENICE,great star of Christ struck upon the edge of a golden dome.  Saint
3031,VENICE,"Mark's Church, gazing down the length of the chequered Piazza,"
3032,VENICE,"thrusting itself upon the black and white pavement, rising out of the"
3033,VENICE,"flat tiles in a rattle of colours, soaring toward the full sky like a"
3034,VENICE,broken prism whirling at last into the gold bubbles of its five wide
3035,VENICE,"domes.  The Campanile mounts above it, but the Campanile is only"
3036,VENICE,"brick, even if it has a pointed top which you cannot see without"
3037,VENICE,"lying on your back.  The pigeons can fly up to it, but the pigeons"
3038,VENICE,prefer the angles and hollows of the sculptured church.
3039,VENICE,
3040,VENICE,"Saint Mark's Church--and over the chief arch, among the capitals of"
3041,VENICE,"foaming leaves and bent grasses, trample four great horses.  They are"
3042,VENICE,"of gold, of gilding so fine that it has not faded.  They are"
3043,VENICE,"tarnished here and there, but their fair colour overcomes the green"
3044,VENICE,corroding and is a blinding to the eyes in sunshine.  Four
3045,VENICE,"magnificent, muscular horses, lightly stepping upon traceried"
3046,VENICE,"columns, one forefoot raised to launch them forward.  They stand over"
3047,VENICE,"the high door, caught back a moment before springing, held an instant"
3048,VENICE,"to the perfection of a movement about to begin, and the pigeons"
3049,VENICE,circle round them brushing against their sides like wind.
3050,VENICE,
3051,VENICE,
3052,VENICE,"But, dear me, Saint Mark's is the only thing in the Piazza that is"
3053,VENICE,"not talking, and walking to and fro, and cheapening shoe buckles at a"
3054,VENICE,"stall, and playing panfil and bassetta at little round tables by the"
3055,VENICE,"wall, and singing to guitars, and whistling to poodles, and shouting"
3056,VENICE,"to acquaintances, and giving orders to servants, and whispering a"
3057,VENICE,"scandal behind fans, and carrying tomatoes in copper pans, and flying"
3058,VENICE,"on messages, and lying to creditors, and spying on suspects, and"
3059,VENICE,"colliding with masked loungers, and crying out the merits of fried"
3060,VENICE,"fish, caught when the tide comes leaping through the Tre Porti.  A"
3061,VENICE,"dish of tea at a coffee-house, and then cross one leg over the other"
3062,VENICE,"and wait.  She will be here by seven o'clock, and a faithful"
3063,VENICE,"_cicisbeo_ has her charms to muse upon until then.  Ah, Venice,"
3064,VENICE,"chattering, flattering, occupied Venice, what are the sculptured"
3065,VENICE,angels and golden horses to you.  You are far too busy to glance at
3066,VENICE,"them.  They are chiefly remarkable as curiosities, for whoever saw a"
3067,VENICE,"real angel, and as to a real horse--""I saw a stuffed one for a"
3068,VENICE,"_soldo_, the other day, in the Campo San Polo.  _Un elephanto_,"
3069,VENICE,"Gastone, taller than my shoulder and the eyes were made of glass,"
3070,VENICE,"they would pass for perfect any day."""
3071,VENICE,
3072,VENICE,
3073,VENICE,"Ah, the beautiful palaces, with their gateways of gilded iron frilled"
3074,VENICE,"into arms and coronets, quilled into shooting leaves and tendrils,"
3075,VENICE,"filled with rosettes, fretted by heraldic emblems!  Ah, the beautiful"
3076,VENICE,"taste, which wastes no time on heavy stone, but cuts flowers, and"
3077,VENICE,"foliage, and flourishes, and ribbons out of--stucco!  Bows of stucco"
3078,VENICE,"glued about a ceiling by Tiepolo, and ranged underneath, frail"
3079,VENICE,"white-and-gold, rose-and-gold, green-and-gold chairs, fair consoles"
3080,VENICE,of polished lacquer supporting great mirrors of Murano.  Hangings of
3081,VENICE,"blue silk with silver fringes, behind your folds, la Signora Benzona"
3082,VENICE,accords a favour to the Cavalier Giuseppe Trevis.  Upon a
3083,VENICE,"salmon-coloured sofa striped with pistachio-green, the Cavaliera"
3084,VENICE,"Contarini flirts with both her _cicisbei_ at once, in a charming"
3085,VENICE,"impartiality.  Kisses?  Ah, indeed, certainly kisses.  Hands tickling"
3086,VENICE,"against hands?  But assuredly, one for each of you.  The heel of a"
3087,VENICE,"left slipper caught against a buckled shoe, the toe of a right foot"
3088,VENICE,"pressed beneath a broader sole; but the toll is finished.  ""Tut!"
3089,VENICE,Tut!  Gentlemen!  With the other present!  Have you no delicacy?
3090,VENICE,"To-night perhaps, after the Ridotto, we will take a giro in my"
3091,VENICE,"gondola as far as Malamocco, Signor Bianchi.  And to-morrow, Carlo"
3092,VENICE,"Pin, will you go to church with me?  There is something in the tones"
3093,VENICE,"of an organ, I know not what exactly, but it has its effect."""
3094,VENICE,
3095,VENICE,
3096,VENICE,"""You rang, _Illustrissima_?""  ""Of course I rang, Stupid, did you"
3097,VENICE,"think it was the cat?""  ""Your nobility desires?""  ""The time,"
3098,VENICE,"Blockhead, what is the time?""  ""Past seven, _Illustrissima_.""  ""Ye"
3099,VENICE,"Gods, how time passes when one sleeps!  Bring my chocolate at once,"
3100,VENICE,"and call Giannina.""  With a yawn, the lady rises, just as the sun"
3101,VENICE,fades away from the flying figure of Fortune on the top of the
3102,VENICE,"Dogana.  ""Candles, Moracchio.""  And the misty mirrors prick and"
3103,VENICE,"pulsate with reflections of blurred flame.  Flame-points, and behind"
3104,VENICE,them the puce-coloured curtains of a bed; an escritoire with
3105,VENICE,feathered pens and Spanish wax; a table with rouge-pots and
3106,VENICE,"powder-boxes; a lady, naked as a Venus, slipping into a silk shift."
3107,VENICE,"In the misty mirrors, she is all curves and colour, all slenderness"
3108,VENICE,"and tapering, all languor and vivacity.  Even Giannina murmurs, ""_Che"
3109,VENICE,"bella Madonna mia!_"" as she pulls the shift into place.  But the door"
3110,VENICE,"is ajar, a mere harmless crack to make a fuss about.  ""Only one eye,"
3111,VENICE,"_Cara Mia_, I assure you the other saw nothing but the panel.  I ask"
3112,VENICE,"for so much, and I have only taken the pleasure of one little eye.  I"
3113,VENICE,"must kiss them, _Signora Bellissima_, two little red berries, like"
3114,VENICE,the fruit of the _potentillas_ in the grass at Sant' Elena.  _Musica!
3115,VENICE,Musica!_  The barque of music is coming down the canal.  Sit on my
3116,VENICE,"knee a moment, the Casino can wait; and after you have won a thousand"
3117,VENICE,"zecchini, will you be a second Danae and go with me to the early"
3118,VENICE,morning market?  Then you shall come home and sleep all day in the
3119,VENICE,great bed among the roses I shall buy for you.  With your gold?
3120,VENICE,"Perhaps, my dearest tease, the luck has deserted me lately.  But"
3121,VENICE,"there are ways of paying, are there not, and I am an honourable man."""
3122,VENICE,
3123,VENICE,
3124,VENICE,The great horses of Saint Mark's trot softly forward on their
3125,VENICE,"sculptured pedestals, without moving.  Behind them, the glass of the"
3126,VENICE,"arched window is dark, but the Piazza is a bowl of lights, a"
3127,VENICE,tambourine of little bell-stroke laughter.  The golden horses step
3128,VENICE,"forward, dimly shimmering in the light of the lamps below, and the"
3129,VENICE,pigeons sleep quietly on the stands at their feet.
3130,VENICE,
3131,VENICE,
3132,VENICE,Green Lion of Saint Mark upon your high pedestal!  Winged Lion of
3133,VENICE,"Saint Mark, your head turned over the blinding Lagoons to the blue"
3134,VENICE,"Lido, your tail pointing down the sweeping flow of the Grand Canal!"
3135,VENICE,"What do you see, Green Lion of the Patron Saint?  Boats?  Masts?"
3136,VENICE,"Quaint paintings on the broad bows of bragozzi, orange sails"
3137,VENICE,contra-crossing one another over tossing ripples.  Gondolas tipping
3138,VENICE,"to the oars of the _barcajuoli_, slipping under the Ponte della"
3139,VENICE,"Paglia, dipping between sardine _topi_, skipping past the Piazzetta,"
3140,VENICE,"curving away to the Giudecca, where it lies beyond the crystal"
3141,VENICE,pinnacles of Santa Maria della Salute and San Giorgio Maggiore which
3142,VENICE,has the lustre of roses.
3143,VENICE,
3144,VENICE,"What do you smell, Lion?  Boiling hot chestnuts, fried cuttles, fried"
3145,VENICE,puffs of pastry; the pungent odour of salt water and of dead fish;
3146,VENICE,"the nostalgic aroma of sandal-wood and myrrh, of musk, of leopard"
3147,VENICE,skins and the twin tusks of elephants.
3148,VENICE,
3149,VENICE,"And you, great Lion of the Ducal Palace, what goes on at your feet?"
3150,VENICE,"People knotted together or scattering, pattering over the old stones"
3151,VENICE,"in impertinent satin slippers, flippantly tapping the pavement with"
3152,VENICE,"red heels.  Whirls of people circle like the pigeons, knots of people"
3153,VENICE,"spot the greyness of the stones, ribbons of people file along the"
3154,VENICE,"colonnades, rayed lines of people between the Procuratie stripe the"
3155,VENICE,"pavement sideways, criss-cross, at oblique angles.  Spangles snap and"
3156,VENICE,fade; gems glitter.  A gentleman in a buttercup-coloured coat goes by
3157,VENICE,with a bouquet.  A sea-green gown brocaded with cherry and violet
3158,VENICE,stays an instant before a stall to buy a packet of ambergris.
3159,VENICE,Pilgrims with staffs and cockles knock the stones as they shuffle
3160,VENICE,"along, a water-carrier shouts out a song.  A scarlet sacristan"
3161,VENICE,jingles his keys; purple robes of justices saunter at ease.  Messer
3162,VENICE,"Goldoni hustles by to a rehearsal, and three famous _castrati_, i"
3163,VENICE,"Signori Pacchierotti, Aprili, Rubenelli, rustle their mantles and"
3164,VENICE,"adjust their masks, ogling the ladies with gold lorgnons.  Blind men"
3165,VENICE,"sniffle into flageolets, marionette men hurry on to a distant Campo"
3166,VENICE,"in a flurry of cotton streamers.  If Venice is a flowing of water, it"
3167,VENICE,is also a flowing of people.  All Europe runs into this wide square.
3168,VENICE,"There is Monsieur Montesquieu, just from France, taking notes on the"
3169,VENICE,"sly; there is Mrs. Piozzi, from England, with an eye to everything,"
3170,VENICE,"even chicken-coops; Herr Goethe, from the Court at Weimar, trying to"
3171,VENICE,"overcome a fit of mental indigestion; Madame Vigée le Brun,"
3172,VENICE,questioning the merit of her work and that of Rosalba Carriera.  You
3173,VENICE,"have much to watch, Lion, the whole earth cannot match the pageant of"
3174,VENICE,"this great square, in the limpid sun-shot air, between the towering"
3175,VENICE,"Campanile and the blaze of Saint Mark's angels.  Star-fish patterns,"
3176,VENICE,"jelly-fish rounds of colour, if the sea quivers with variety so does"
3177,VENICE,"the Piazza.  But above, on the façade of the jewelled church, the"
3178,VENICE,"horses do not change.  They stand vigorous and immovable, stepping"
3179,VENICE,lightly as though poised upon glass.  Metal horses set upon shifting
3180,VENICE,"shards of glass, and the soft diphthongs of the Venetian dialect"
3181,VENICE,float over them like wind.
3182,VENICE,
3183,VENICE,
3184,VENICE,"There are two Venices, the one we walk upon, and the one which wavers"
3185,VENICE,up to us inverted from the water of the canals.  The silver prow of a
3186,VENICE,"gondola winds round a wall, and in the moss-brown water another"
3187,VENICE,"gondola joins it, bottom to bottom, with the teeth of the prow"
3188,VENICE,"infinitely repeated.  A cypress closes the end of a _rio_, and driven"
3189,VENICE,"into the thick water another cypress spindles beneath us, and the"
3190,VENICE,wake of our boat leaves its foliage cut to tatters as it passes on.
3191,VENICE,We plough through the veined pinks and subdued scarlets of the
3192,VENICE,façades of palaces; we sheer a path through a spotted sky and blunt
3193,VENICE,"the tip of a soaring campanile.  Are we swimming in the heavens,"
3194,VENICE,"turned legend and constellation?  Truly it seems so.  ""How you go on,"
3195,VENICE,"Cavalier, certainly you are a foreigner to notice such things.  The"
3196,VENICE,"Lido, Giuseppe.  I have a nostalgia for flowers to-day, and besides,"
3197,VENICE,abroad so early in the afternoon--what shocking style!  The custom of
3198,VENICE,"the country, my dear Sir, here we go to bed by sunlight as you will"
3199,VENICE,"see."""
3200,VENICE,
3201,VENICE,"Sweep out of the broad canal, turn to the hanging snow summits.  Oh,"
3202,VENICE,"the beautiful silver light, the blue light shimmering with silver."
3203,VENICE,The clear sunlight on rose brick and amber marble.  The sky so pale
3204,VENICE,"it is white, so bright it is yellow, so cloudless it is blue.  Oh,"
3205,VENICE,"the shafts of sapphire striping the wide water, the specks of gold"
3206,VENICE,"dancing along it, the diamond roses opening and shutting upon its"
3207,VENICE,surface!  Some one is singing in a distant boat:
3208,VENICE,
3209,VENICE,"""_Amanti, ci vuole costanza in amor'"
3210,VENICE,"Amando,"
3211,VENICE,"Penando,"
3212,VENICE,"Si speri, si, si._"""
3213,VENICE,
3214,VENICE,
3215,VENICE,"The lady shrugs her shoulders.  ""These fishermen are very droll."
3216,VENICE,"What do the _canaglia_ know about love.  Breeding, yes, that is"
3217,VENICE,"certainly their affair, but love!  _Più presto_, Giuseppe.  How the"
3218,VENICE,"sun burns!""  Rock over the streaked Lagoon, gondola, pock the blue"
3219,VENICE,"strips with white, shock purple shadows through the silver strata,"
3220,VENICE,set blocks of iris cannoning against gold.  This is the rainbow over
3221,VENICE,"which we are floating, and the heart-shaped city behind us is a"
3222,VENICE,"reliquary of old ivory laid upon azure silk.  Your hand, Signor the"
3223,VENICE,"Foreigner, be careful lest she wet those fine French stockings, they"
3224,VENICE,"cost I do not know how much a pair.  Now run away across the Lido,"
3225,VENICE,gathering violets and periwinkles.  The lady has a whim for a
3226,VENICE,"_villeggiatura_, and why not?  Those scarlet pomegranate blossoms"
3227,VENICE,will look well in her hair to-night at the opera.  But one cannot
3228,VENICE,"linger long, already the Dolomites are turning pink, and there is a"
3229,VENICE,whole night ahead of us to be cajoled somehow.  A mile away from
3230,VENICE,"Venice and it is too far.  ""_Felicissima notte!_""  Wax candles shine"
3231,VENICE,in the windows.  The little stars of the gondola lanterns glide
3232,VENICE,between dark walls.  Broken moonlight shivers in the canals.  And the
3233,VENICE,"masks come out, thronging the streets and squares with a chequer-work"
3234,VENICE,of black cloaks and white faces.  Little white faces floating like
3235,VENICE,pond-lilies above the water.  Floating faces adrift over unfathomable
3236,VENICE,"depths.  Have you ever heard the words, _Libertà, Independenza, e"
3237,VENICE,"Eguaglianza_?  ""What stuff and nonsense!  Of course I have read your"
3238,VENICE,"great writer, Rousseau; I cried my heart out over '_La Nouvelle"
3239,VENICE,"Héloise_,' but in practice!  Wake my servants, the lazy fellows are"
3240,VENICE,"always asleep, you will find them curled up on the stairs most"
3241,VENICE,likely.  It is time we went to the _Mendicanti_ to hear the oratorio.
3242,VENICE,"Ah, but those poor orphans sing with a charm!  It makes one weep to"
3243,VENICE,"hear them, only the old _Maestro di Capella_ will beat time with his"
3244,VENICE,"music on the grill.  It is quite ridiculous, they could go through it"
3245,VENICE,perfectly without him.  _Misericordia!_  The red light!  That is the
3246,VENICE,gondola of the Supreme Tribunal taking some poor soul to the Piombi;
3247,VENICE,"God protect him!  But it does not concern us, my friend.  _Ridiamo a"
3248,VENICE,"duetto!_""  Little tinkling drops from the oars of the boatmen, little"
3249,VENICE,tinkling laughter wafted across the moonlight.
3250,VENICE,
3251,VENICE,
3252,VENICE,Four horses parading in front of a splendid church.  Four ancient
3253,VENICE,"horses with ears pointed forward, listening.  One foot is raised,"
3254,VENICE,they advance without moving.  To what do they listen?  To the
3255,VENICE,"serenades they have heard so often?  _Cavatine, canzonette_, dance"
3256,VENICE,"songs, hymns, for six hundred years the songs of Venice have drifted"
3257,VENICE,"past them, lightly, as the wings of pigeons.  And month by month the"
3258,VENICE,"old moon has sailed over them, as she did in Constantinople, as she"
3259,VENICE,did in Rome.
3260,VENICE,
3261,VENICE,
3262,VENICE,"Saint Stephen's Day, and the Carnival!  For weeks now Venice will be"
3263,VENICE,amused.  Folly to think of anything but fun.  Toot the fifes!  Bang
3264,VENICE,the drums!  Did you ever see anything so jolly in all your life
3265,VENICE,"before?  Keep your elbows to your sides, there isn't room to square"
3266,VENICE,"them.  ""My!  What a flare!  Rockets in broad daylight!  I declare"
3267,VENICE,they make the old horses of Saint Mark's blush pink when they burst.
3268,VENICE,"Thirsty?  So am I, what will you have?  Wine or oranges?  Don't"
3269,VENICE,"jostle so, old fellow, we can look in the window as well as you.  See"
3270,VENICE,"that apothecary's stall, isn't that a gay festoon?  Curse me, if it"
3271,VENICE,isn't made of leeches; what will these shopkeepers do next!  That
3272,VENICE,"mask has a well-turned ankle.  Good evening, my charmer.  You are as"
3273,VENICE,"beautiful as a parrot, as white as linen, as light as a rabbit.  Ay!"
3274,VENICE,O-o-h!  The she-camel!  She aimed her _confetti_ right at my eye.
3275,VENICE,"Come on, Tito, let's go and see them behead the bull.  Hold on a"
3276,VENICE,"minute though, somebody's pulling my cloak.  Just one little squeeze,"
3277,VENICE,"Beauty, you shouldn't tweak a man's cloak if you don't want to be"
3278,VENICE,"squeezed.  You plump little pudding, you little pecking pigeon, I'll"
3279,VENICE,"get more next time.  Wow!  Here comes Arlecchino.  Push back, push"
3280,VENICE,"back, the comedians are coming.  Stow in your fat belly,"
3281,VENICE,"_'lustrissimo_, you take up room enough for two."""
3282,VENICE,
3283,VENICE,"Somebody beats a gong, and three drummers cleave a path through the"
3284,VENICE,crowd.  Bang!  _Bang!_  BANG!  So loud it splits the hearing.
3285,VENICE,"Mattachino leaps down the path.  He is in white, with red lacings and"
3286,VENICE,"red shoes.  On his arm is a basket of eggs.  Right, left, into the"
3287,VENICE,"crowd, skim the eggs.  Duck--jump--it is no use.  Plump, on some"
3288,VENICE,"one's front; pat, against some one's hat.  The eggs crack, and"
3289,VENICE,"scented waters run out of them, filling the air with the sweet smells"
3290,VENICE,of musk and bergamot.  But here is a wheel of colours rolling down
3291,VENICE,"the path.  Clown!  Clown!  It is Arlecchino, in his patched coat.  It"
3292,VENICE,"was green and he has botched it with red, or is it yellow, or"
3293,VENICE,"possibly blue.  It is hard to tell, he turns so fast.  Three"
3294,VENICE,"somersaults, and he comes up standing, and makes a long nose, and"
3295,VENICE,"sweeps off his hat with the hare's fud, and glares solemnly into the"
3296,VENICE,"eyes of a gentleman in spectacles.  ""Sir,"" says Arlecchino, ""have you"
3297,VENICE,by chance a toothache?  I can tell you how to cure it.  Take an
3298,VENICE,"apple, cut it into four equal parts, put one of these into your"
3299,VENICE,"mouth, and thrust your head into an oven until the apple is baked.  I"
3300,VENICE,"swear on my honour you will never have the toothache again.""  Zip!"
3301,VENICE,Sizz!  No use in the cane.  A pirouette and he is away again.  A
3302,VENICE,"hand-spring, a double cut-under, and the parti-coloured rags are only"
3303,VENICE,a tag bouncing up out of surging black mantles.  But there is
3304,VENICE,"something more wonderful yet.  Set your faces to the Piazzetta,"
3305,VENICE,"people; push, slam, jam, to keep your places.  ""A balloon is going up"
3306,VENICE,"from the Dogana del Mare, a balloon like a moon or something else"
3307,VENICE,"starry.  A meteor, a comet, I don't really know what; it looks, so"
3308,VENICE,"they say, like a huge apricot, or a pear--yes, that's surely the"
3309,VENICE,"thing--blushing red, mellow yellow, a fruit on the wing, garlanded"
3310,VENICE,"with streamers and tails, all a-whirl and a-flutter.  Cut the string"
3311,VENICE,"and she sails, till she lands in the gutter.""  ""How do you know she"
3312,VENICE,"lands in the gutter, Booby?""  ""Where else should she land, unless in"
3313,VENICE,"the sea?""  ""You're a fool, I suppose you sat up all night writing"
3314,VENICE,"that doggerel.""  ""Not at all, it is an improvisation.""  ""Here, keep"
3315,VENICE,"back, you can't push past me with your talk.  Oh!  Look!  Look!"""
3316,VENICE,
3317,VENICE,That is a balloon.  It rises slowly--slowly--above the Dogana.  It
3318,VENICE,"wavers, dips, and poises; it mounts in the silver air, it floats"
3319,VENICE,"without direction; suspended in movement, it hangs, a clear pear of"
3320,VENICE,"red and yellow, opposite the melting, opal-tinted city.  And the"
3321,VENICE,"reflection of it also floats, perfect in colour but cooler, perfect"
3322,VENICE,"in outline but more vague, in the glassy water of the Grand Canal."
3323,VENICE,The blue sky sustains it; the blue water encloses it.  Then balloon
3324,VENICE,"and reflection swing gently seaward.  One ascends, the other"
3325,VENICE,"descends.  Each dwindles to a speck.  Ah, the semblance is gone, the"
3326,VENICE,"water has nothing; but the sky focusses about a point of fire, a"
3327,VENICE,"formless iridescence sailing higher, become a mere burning, until"
3328,VENICE,that too is absorbed in the brilliance of the clouds.
3329,VENICE,
3330,VENICE,"You cheer, people, but you do not know for what.  A beautiful toy?"
3331,VENICE,"Undoubtedly you think so.  Shout yourselves hoarse, you who have"
3332,VENICE,"conquered the sea, do you underestimate the air?  Joke, laugh,"
3333,VENICE,"purblind populace.  You have been vouchsafed an awful vision, and you"
3334,VENICE,do nothing but clap your hands.
3335,VENICE,
3336,VENICE,"That is over, and here is Pantalone calling to you.  ""Going--going--I"
3337,VENICE,am selling my furniture.  Two dozen chairs of fine holland; fourteen
3338,VENICE,tables of almond paste; six majolica mattresses full of scrapings of
3339,VENICE,haycocks; a semolina bedcover; six truffled cushions; two pavilions
3340,VENICE,of spider-web trimmed with tassels made from the moustaches of Swiss
3341,VENICE,door-keepers.  Oh!  The Moon!  The Moon!  The good little yellow
3342,VENICE,"moon, no bigger than an omelet of eight eggs.  Come, I will throw in"
3343,VENICE,"the moon.  A quarter-ducat for the moon, good people.  Take your"
3344,VENICE,"opportunity."""
3345,VENICE,
3346,VENICE,"Great gold horses, quietly stepping above the little mandarin"
3347,VENICE,"figures, strong horses above the whirling porcelain figures, are the"
3348,VENICE,pigeons the only birds in Venice?  Have the swallows told you
3349,VENICE,"nothing, flying from the West?"
3350,VENICE,
3351,VENICE,The bells of Saint Mark's Church ring midnight.  The carnival is over.
3352,VENICE,
3353,VENICE,"In the deserted square, the pavement is littered with feathers,"
3354,VENICE,"_confetti_, orange-peel, and pumpkin-seeds.  But the golden horses on"
3355,VENICE,"the balcony over the high door trot forward, without moving, and the"
3356,VENICE,shadow of the arch above them is thrown farther and farther forward
3357,VENICE,as the moon drops toward the Lagoon.
3358,VENICE,
3359,VENICE,
3360,VENICE,Bronze armies marching on a sea-shell city.  Slanted muskets filing
3361,VENICE,"over the passes of tall Alps.  Who is this man who leads you, carven"
3362,VENICE,"in new bronze, supple as metal still cooling, firm as metal from a"
3363,VENICE,fresh-broken mold?  A bright bronze general heading armies.  The
3364,VENICE,"tread of his grenadiers is awful, continuous.  How will it be in the"
3365,VENICE,streets of the glass city?  These men are the flying letters of a new
3366,VENICE,"gospel.  They are the tablets of another law.  Twenty-eight, this"
3367,VENICE,"general!  Ah, but the metal is well compounded.  He has been"
3368,VENICE,victorious in fourteen pitched battles and seventy fights; he has
3369,VENICE,"taken five hundred field pieces, and two thousand of heavy calibre;"
3370,VENICE,he has sent thirty millions back to the treasury of France.  The
3371,VENICE,Kings of Naples and Sardinia write him friendly letters; the Pope and
3372,VENICE,the Duke of Parma weary themselves with compliments.  The English
3373,VENICE,"have retired from Genoa, Leghorn, and Corsica."
3374,VENICE,
3375,VENICE,"Little glass masks, have you heard nothing of this man?  What of the"
3376,VENICE,"new French ambassador, Citizen Lallemont?  You have seen his"
3377,VENICE,gondoliers and the _tricolore_ cockade in their caps?  It is a
3378,VENICE,"puzzling business, but you can hardly expect us to be alarmed, we"
3379,VENICE,"have been a republic for centuries.  Still, these new ideas are"
3380,VENICE,"intriguing, they say several gentlemen have adopted them.  ""Alvise"
3381,VENICE,"Pisani, my Dear, and Abbate Colalto, also Bragadin, and Soranza, and"
3382,VENICE,"Labbia.  Oh, there was much talk about it last night.  Such strange"
3383,VENICE,"notions!  But the cockade is very pretty.  I have the ribbon, and I"
3384,VENICE,"am going to make a few.  Signora Fontana gave me the pattern."""
3385,VENICE,
3386,VENICE,"Columbus discovered America.  Ah, it was then you should have made"
3387,VENICE,your cockades.  Is it Bonaparte or the Cape of Good Hope which has
3388,VENICE,"compassed your destiny?  Little porcelain figures, can you stand the"
3389,VENICE,shock of bronze?
3390,VENICE,
3391,VENICE,"No, evidently.  The quills of the Senate secretaries are worn blunt,"
3392,VENICE,writing note after note to the General of the Armies.  But still he
3393,VENICE,"marches forward, and his soldiers, dressed as peasants, have invaded"
3394,VENICE,Breschia and Bergamo.  And what a man!  Never satisfied.  He must
3395,VENICE,"have this--that--and other things as well.  He must have guns,"
3396,VENICE,"cannon, horses, mules, food, forage.  What is all this talk of a"
3397,VENICE,Cisalpine Republic?  The Senate wavers like so many sea anemones in
3398,VENICE,an advancing tide.  Ascension Day is approaching.  Shall the Doge go
3399,VENICE,"in the _Bucentoro_ to wed the sea ""in token of real and perpetual"
3400,VENICE,"dominion""?  The Senate dictates, the secretaries write, and the"
3401,VENICE,_Arsenalotti_ polish the brasses of the _Bucentoro_ and wait.
3402,VENICE,"Brightly shine the overpolished brasses of the _Bucentoro_, but the"
3403,VENICE,ships in the Arsenal are in bad repair and the crews wanting.
3404,VENICE,
3405,VENICE,"It is Holy Saturday in Venice, and solemn processions march to the"
3406,VENICE,"churches.  The slow chanting of choirs rises above the floating city,"
3407,VENICE,but in the Citizen Lallemont's apartments is a jangling of spurred
3408,VENICE,"heels, a clanking of cavalry sabres.  General Junot arrived in the"
3409,VENICE,small hours of the night.  Holy Saturday is nothing to a reformed
3410,VENICE,"Frenchman; the General's business will not wait, he must see the"
3411,VENICE,"Signory at once.  Desert your churches, convene the College in haste."
3412,VENICE,A bronze man cannot be opposed by a Senate of glass.  Is it for
3413,VENICE,"fantasy that so many people are wearing the _tricolore_, or is it"
3414,VENICE,politeness to the visiting general?  But what does he say?  French
3415,VENICE,"soldiers murdered!  Nonsense, a mere street row between Bergamese."
3416,VENICE,But Junot thunders and clanks his sabre.  A sword is a terrible thing
3417,VENICE,in a cabinet of biscuit figurines.  Let that pass.  He has gone.  But
3418,VENICE,"Venice is shaken.  The stately palaces totter on their rotting piles,"
3419,VENICE,"the _campi_ buzz with voices, the Piazza undulates to a gesticulating"
3420,VENICE,"multitude.  Only the pigeons wheel unconcernedly about the Campanile,"
3421,VENICE,"and the great horses stand, poised and majestic, beneath the mounting"
3422,VENICE,angels of Saint Mark's Church.
3423,VENICE,
3424,VENICE,Ascension Day draws nearer.  The brasses of the _Bucentoro_ shine
3425,VENICE,like gold.  Surely the Doge will not desert his bride; or has the
3426,VENICE,"jilt tired of her long subjection?  False water, upon your breast"
3427,VENICE,"rock many navies, how should you remain true to a ship which fears to"
3428,VENICE,"wet its keel.  The _Bucentoro_ glitters in the Arsenal, she blazes"
3429,VENICE,"with glass and gilding drawn up safely on a runway of dry planks,"
3430,VENICE,"while over the sea, beyond the Lido, rises the spark of sails.  The"
3431,VENICE,"vessel is hull down, but the tiers of canvas lift up, one after the"
3432,VENICE,"other: skysails, royals, topgallantsails, topsails, mainsails, and at"
3433,VENICE,"last, the woodwork.  Then gleaming ports, then streaming water"
3434,VENICE,"flashed from a curved bow.  A good ship, but she flys the"
3435,VENICE,"_tricolore_.  This is no wedding barge, there is no winged lion on"
3436,VENICE,"that flag.  There is no music, no choir singing hymns.  Men run to"
3437,VENICE,"and fro in San Nicolo Fort, peering through spy-glasses.  Ah, she"
3438,VENICE,"will observe the rules, the skysails come down, then the royals--but"
3439,VENICE,why in thunder do not the topgallantsails follow?  The fellow is
3440,VENICE,coming right under the fort.  Guns.  He salutes.  Answer from the
3441,VENICE,fort.  Citizen Lallemont has agreed that no French vessel shall enter
3442,VENICE,"the port, even the English do not attempt it.  But the son of a dog"
3443,VENICE,"comes on.  Send out boats, Comandatore Pizzamano.  _Per Dio_, he is"
3444,VENICE,passing them!  Touch off the cannon as a warning.  One shot.  Two.
3445,VENICE,"Some one is on the poop with a speaking-trumpet.  ""What ship is"
3446,VENICE,"that?""  ""_Le Libérateur d'Italie.  Le Capitaine Laugier.  Marine de"
3447,VENICE,"la République Française._""  ""It is forbidden to enter the port,"
3448,VENICE,"_Signor Capitano Laugier_.""  ""We intend to anchor outside.""  Do you!"
3449,VENICE,Then why not clew up those damned topgallantsails.  My God!  She is
3450,VENICE,past the fort.  She has slipped through the entrance; she is in the
3451,VENICE,"Lagoon.  Her forefoot cuts the diamond water, she sheers her way"
3452,VENICE,"through the calm colour reflections, her bow points straight at the"
3453,VENICE,rose and violet city swimming under the light clouds of early
3454,VENICE,"afternoon.  Shock!  Shiver!  Foul of a Venetian galley, by all that's"
3455,VENICE,"holy.  What beastly seamanship!  The Venetians will not stand it, I"
3456,VENICE,"tell you.  Pop!  Pop!  Those are muskets, drop on them with"
3457,VENICE,"cutlasses, _mes enfants_.  Chop into the cursed foreigners.  ""_Non"
3458,VENICE,"vogliamo forestieri qui._""  Boom!  The cannon of Fort Sant' Andrea."
3459,VENICE,"Good guns, well pointed, the smoke from them draws a shade over the"
3460,VENICE,water.  Down come the topgallantsails.  You have paid a price for
3461,VENICE,"your entrance, Captain Laugier, but it is not enough.  ""_Viva San"
3462,VENICE,"Marco!_""  Detestable voices, these Venetians.  That cry is confusing."
3463,VENICE,Puff!  The smoke goes by.  Three marines have fallen.  The cannon
3464,VENICE,fire at intervals of two minutes.  Hot work under a burning sky.  Hot
3465,VENICE,work on a burning deck.  The smoothness of the water is flecked with
3466,VENICE,"bits of wood.  A dead body rolls overboard, and bobs up and down"
3467,VENICE,"beside the ships.  A sailor slips from a yard, and is spiked on an"
3468,VENICE,upturned bayonet.  Over the water comes the pealing of many bells.
3469,VENICE,"Captain Laugier is dead, and the city tolls his requiem.  Strike your"
3470,VENICE,"colours, beaten Frenchmen.  Bronze cannot walk upon the sea.  You"
3471,VENICE,"have failed and succeeded, for upon your Captain's fallen body the"
3472,VENICE,"bronze feet have found their bridge.  Do you rejoice, old Arsenal?  A"
3473,VENICE,"captive ship towed up to you again!  Ah, the cannon firing has"
3474,VENICE,"brought the rain.  Yes, and thunder too, and in the thunder a voice"
3475,VENICE,of bronze.  The _Bucentoro_ will not take the water this year.  Cover
3476,VENICE,"up the brasses, _Arsenalotti_.  Ascension Day is nothing to Venice"
3477,VENICE,now.
3478,VENICE,
3479,VENICE,
3480,VENICE,"Yesterday this was matter for rejoicing, but to-day...  Get the best"
3481,VENICE,"rowers, order relays of horses on the mainland, post hot foot to the"
3482,VENICE,"Commissioners at Gratz.  One ship is nothing, but if they send"
3483,VENICE,twenty!  What has the bronze General already said to the
3484,VENICE,"Commissioners.  The Senate wonders, and wears itself out in"
3485,VENICE,"speculation.  They will give money, they will plunder the pockets of"
3486,VENICE,the populace to save Venice.  Can a child save his toys when manhood
3487,VENICE,"is upon him?  The century is old, already another lies in its arms."
3488,VENICE,"Month by month a new moon rises over Venice, but century by century!"
3489,VENICE,"They cannot see, these Senators.  They cannot hear the General"
3490,VENICE,"cutting the Commissioners short in a sort of fury.  ""I wish no more"
3491,VENICE,"Inquisition, no more Senate.  I will be an Attila for Venice.  This"
3492,VENICE,"government is old; it must fall!""  Pretty words from bronze to"
3493,VENICE,"porcelain.  A stain on a brave, new gospel.  ""Save Venice,"" the"
3494,VENICE,"letter urges, and the Commissioners depart for Trieste.  But the"
3495,VENICE,"doors are locked.  The General blocks his entrances.  ""I cannot"
3496,VENICE,"receive you, Gentlemen, you and your Senate are disgusting to the"
3497,VENICE,"French blood.""  A pantomime before a temple, with a priest acting the"
3498,VENICE,"part of chief comedian.  Strange burlesque, arabesquing the"
3499,VENICE,characters of a creed.  You think this man is a greedy conqueror.  Go
3500,VENICE,"home, thinking.  Your moment flutters off the calendar, your world"
3501,VENICE,dissolves and another takes its place.  This is the cock-crow of
3502,VENICE,"ghosts.  Slowly pass up the canal, slowly enter the Ducal Palace."
3503,VENICE,"Debate, everlastingly debate.  And while you quibble the"
3504,VENICE,communication with the continent is cut.
3505,VENICE,
3506,VENICE,"He has declared war, the bronze General.  What can be done?  The"
3507,VENICE,little glass figures crack under the strain.  Condulmer will not
3508,VENICE,fight.  Pesaro flees to Austria.  So the measure awaits a vote.  A
3509,VENICE,grave Senate consulting a ballot-box as to whether it shall cut its
3510,VENICE,"throat.  This is not suicide, but murder; this is not murder, but the"
3511,VENICE,"turned leaf of an almanac.  ""Divide!  Divide!""  What is the writing"
3512,VENICE,"on the other side?  ""_Viva la Libertà_,"" shouts General Salimbeni"
3513,VENICE,"from a window.  Stupid crowd, it will not give a cheer.  It is queer"
3514,VENICE,"what an unconscionable objection people have to dying.  ""_Viva San"
3515,VENICE,"Marco!_"" shouts General Salimbeni.  Ah, now you hear!  Such a racket,"
3516,VENICE,and the old lion flag hoisted everywhere.  But that was a rash thing
3517,VENICE,"to do.  It brings the crash.  They fight, fight for old Saint Mark,"
3518,VENICE,"they smash, burn, demolish.  Who wore the _tricolore_?  Plunder their"
3519,VENICE,"houses.  No you don't, no selling us to foreigners.  They cannot"
3520,VENICE,"read, the people, they do not see that the print has changed.  By"
3521,VENICE,dint of cannon you can stop them.  Stop them suddenly like a clock
3522,VENICE,dropped from a wall.
3523,VENICE,
3524,VENICE,
3525,VENICE,Venice!  Venice!  The star-wakes gleam and shatter in your still
3526,VENICE,"canals, and the great horses pace forward, vigorous, unconcerned,"
3527,VENICE,"beautiful, treading your grief as they tread the passing winds."
3528,VENICE,
3529,VENICE,
3530,VENICE,"The riot is over, but another may break out.  A dead republic cannot"
3531,VENICE,control its citizens.  General Baraguey d'Hilliers is at Mestre.  His
3532,VENICE,"dragoons will keep order.  Shame, nobles and abdicated Senate!  But"
3533,VENICE,can one blame the inactivity of the dead?  French dragoons in little
3534,VENICE,boats.  The 5th and 63rd of the line proceeding to Venice in forty
3535,VENICE,little boats.  Grenadiers embarked for a funeral.  Soldiers cracking
3536,VENICE,"jokes, and steady oar-strokes, warping them over the water toward"
3537,VENICE,"Venice.  A dark city, scarcely a lamp is lit.  A match-spark slits"
3538,VENICE,"the darkness, a drummer is lighting his pipe.  Ah, there are walls"
3539,VENICE,ahead.  The dull bones of the dead.  Water swashes against marble.
3540,VENICE,"They are in the canal, their voices echo from doors and porches."
3541,VENICE,"Forty boats, and the bobble of them washes the water step and step"
3542,VENICE,"above its usual height on the stairways.  ""_C'est une église ça!_"""
3543,VENICE,"""_Mais, oui, Bêta, tu pensais pourtant pas que tu entrais en France."
3544,VENICE,"Nous sommes dans une sale ville aristocratique, et je m'en fiche,"
3545,VENICE,"moi!_""  Brave brigadier, spit into the canal, what else can a man of"
3546,VENICE,the new order do to show his enlightenment.  Two regiments of
3547,VENICE,"seasoned soldiers, two regiments of free citizens, forty boat-loads"
3548,VENICE,of thinking men to goad a moribund nation into the millennium.  The
3549,VENICE,"new century arriving with a flower in its button-hole, the"
3550,VENICE,_carmagnole_ ousting the _furlana_.  Perhaps--perhaps--but years pile
3551,VENICE,up and then collapse.  Will gaps start between one and another?
3552,VENICE,"Settle your gun-straps, 63rd of the line, we land here by the dim"
3553,VENICE,shine of a lantern held by a bombardier.  Tier and tier the soldiers
3554,VENICE,march through Venice.  Their steps racket like the mallets of
3555,VENICE,"marble-cutters in the narrow _calli_, and the sound of them over"
3556,VENICE,bridges is the drum-beating of hard rain.
3557,VENICE,
3558,VENICE,"There are soldiers everywhere, Venice is stuffed with soldiers.  They"
3559,VENICE,"are at the Arsenal, on the Rialto, at San Stefano, and four hundred"
3560,VENICE,"stack muskets, and hang their bearskins on the top of them, in the"
3561,VENICE,middle of the Piazza.
3562,VENICE,
3563,VENICE,
3564,VENICE,"Golden horses, the sound of violins is hushed, the pigeons who brush"
3565,VENICE,past you in the red and rising sunlight have just been perching on
3566,VENICE,"crossed bayonets.  Set your faces to this army, advance toward them,"
3567,VENICE,paw the air over their heads.  They do not observe you--yet.  You are
3568,VENICE,"confounded with jewels, and leaves, and statues.  You are a part of"
3569,VENICE,"the great church, even though you stand poised to leave it, and"
3570,VENICE,"already a sergeant has seen you.  ""_Tiens,_"" says he, ""_voilà les"
3571,VENICE,"quatre chevaux d'or.  Ah, mais ils sont magnifiques!  Et quelle drôle"
3572,VENICE,"d'idée de les avoir montés sur la Cathédrale._"""
3573,VENICE,
3574,VENICE,"The century wanes, the moon-century is gnawed and eaten, but the feet"
3575,VENICE,"of the great horses stand upon its fragments, full-tilted to an"
3576,VENICE,"arrested advance, and the green corroding on their sides is hidden in"
3577,VENICE,the glare of gold.
3578,VENICE,
3579,VENICE,
3580,VENICE,"""For the honour and independence of the infant Cisalpine Republic,"
3581,VENICE,"the affectionate and loving Republic of France orders and commands--"""
3582,VENICE,
3583,VENICE,"What does she command?  Precisely, that the new Government shall walk"
3584,VENICE,"in solemn procession round the Piazza, and that a mass of"
3585,VENICE,thanksgiving shall be celebrated in Saint Mark's Church and the image
3586,VENICE,of the Virgin exposed to the rejoicing congregation.  Who would have
3587,VENICE,supposed that Venetians could be so dumb.  The acclamations seem
3588,VENICE,"mostly in the French tongue.  Never mind, it takes more than a day to"
3589,VENICE,"translate a creed into a new language.  Liberty is a great prize,"
3590,VENICE,"good Venetians, although it must be admitted that she appears in"
3591,VENICE,"disguise for the moment.  She wears a mask, that is all, and you"
3592,VENICE,should be accustomed to masks.  The soldiers bask in the warm
3593,VENICE,"sunshine, and doubtless the inhabitants bask in the sight of the"
3594,VENICE,"soldiers, but they conceal their satisfaction very adroitly.  Still,"
3595,VENICE,General Baraguey d'Hilliers has no doubt that it is there.  This
3596,VENICE,liberation of a free people is a famous exploit.  He is a bit nettled
3597,VENICE,"at their apathy, for he has always heard that they were of a gay"
3598,VENICE,"temperament.  ""_Sacré Bleu!_  And we are giving them so much!"""
3599,VENICE,
3600,VENICE,"Indeed, this giving is done with a magnificent generosity.  It is"
3601,VENICE,exactly on Ascension Day that Bonaparte writes from Montebello:
3602,VENICE,"""Conformably to your desire, Citizens, I have ordered the"
3603,VENICE,municipalities of Padua and Treviso to allow the passage of the
3604,VENICE,"foodstuffs necessary to the provisionment of the town of Venice."""
3605,VENICE,
3606,VENICE,"""Real and perpetual dominion,"" and now a boat-load of food is a"
3607,VENICE,"condescension!  Pink and purple water, your little ripples jest at"
3608,VENICE,"these emblazoned palaces, your waves chuckle down the long Rivas, you"
3609,VENICE,reflect the new flag of Venice which even the Dey of Algiers refuses
3610,VENICE,"to respect, and patter your light heels upon it as on a"
3611,VENICE,"dancing-floor.  There will be no more use for the _Bucentoro_, of"
3612,VENICE,"course.  So rip off the gilding, pack up the mirrors, chop the"
3613,VENICE,timbers into firewood.  This is good work for soldiers with nothing
3614,VENICE,"to do.  There are other ships to be dismantled too, and some few"
3615,VENICE,seaworthy enough to send to the army at Corfu.  But if they have
3616,VENICE,"taken away Ascension Day, the French will give Venice a new fête."
3617,VENICE,"Ah! and one so beautiful!  Beat the drums, ring the church-bells, set"
3618,VENICE,"up a Tree of Liberty in the Great Square, this fête is past telling."
3619,VENICE,"So writes the Citizen Arnault, from his room in the _Queen of"
3620,VENICE,"England_ inn.  He bites his pen, he looks out on the little canal"
3621,VENICE,"with its narrow bridge, he fusses with his watch-chain.  It is not"
3622,VENICE,easy to write to the bronze General.  He dips in the ink and starts
3623,VENICE,"again.  ""The people take no active part in what goes on here.  They"
3624,VENICE,"have seen the lions fall without making any sign of joy.""  That"
3625,VENICE,certainly is queer.  Perhaps Citizen Arnault did not hear that
3626,VENICE,"gondolier, who when they chiselled out ""_Pax tibi, Marce, evangelista"
3627,VENICE,"meus_"" on the lion's book, and chiselled in ""_Diritti dell' uomo e"
3628,VENICE,"del cittadino_,"" exclaimed: ""The lion has turned over a new leaf."""
3629,VENICE,"Does that sound like grief?  Certainly not, think the French"
3630,VENICE,"soldiers, and yet the Doge's robes, the Golden Book, burn in silence,"
3631,VENICE,"until a corporal strikes up the ""_Marseillaise_.""  They make a grand"
3632,VENICE,"blaze too; why, the boatmen far off in the hazy Lagoon can hear the"
3633,VENICE,crackle of it snapping over the water.  Then the columns!  The
3634,VENICE,"columns produce a lovely effect, one all wound with _tricolore_ flags"

3636,VENICE,"Venice grateful,"" on its front, and on the back, ""Bonaparte.""  The"
3637,VENICE,"other is not so gay, but most proper and desirable.  It is hung with"
3638,VENICE,"crêpe, and the letters read: ""To the shade of the victim of"
3639,VENICE,"oligarchy, Venice sorrowful,"" and, ""Laugier.""  To be sure there has"
3640,VENICE,"been considerable excitement, and the great green lion has been"
3641,VENICE,"thrown down and shattered in at least eighty fragments, but the"
3642,VENICE,soldiers did it.  The populace were simply stolid and staring.
3643,VENICE,Citizen Arnault fidgets in his chair.  But other affairs march
3644,VENICE,better.  He has found the only copy of Anacharsis which is known to
3645,VENICE,"be in Venice; he is going to hunt for Homer, for he wants to put it"
3646,VENICE,with the Ossian of Cesarotti which he has already taken from the
3647,VENICE,"Library.  Here his pen runs rapidly, he has an inspiration.  ""There"
3648,VENICE,"are four superb horses which the Venetians took when, in company with"
3649,VENICE,"the French, they sacked Constantinople.  These horses are placed over"
3650,VENICE,the portal of the Ducal Church.  Have not the French some right to
3651,VENICE,"claim them, or at least to accept them of Venetian gratitude?""  The"
3652,VENICE,"bronze General has an eye to a man, witness this really excellent"
3653,VENICE,"plan.  Fold your letter, Citizen.  Press your fob down upon the seal."
3654,VENICE,"You may feel proud as you ring for candles, no one will have hurt"
3655,VENICE,Venice more than you.
3656,VENICE,
3657,VENICE,
3658,VENICE,The blue night softens the broken top of the column in the Piazzetta
3659,VENICE,where it juts against the sky.  The violet night sifts shadows over
3660,VENICE,"the white, mounting angels of Saint Mark's Church; it throws an"
3661,VENICE,aureole of lilac over the star of Christ and melts it into the
3662,VENICE,glimmering dome behind.  But upon the horses it clashes with the
3663,VENICE,"glitter of steel.  Blue striking gold, and together producing a"
3664,VENICE,"white-heart fire.  Cold, as in great fire, hard as in new-kindled"
3665,VENICE,"fire, outlined as behind a flame which folds back upon itself in lack"
3666,VENICE,"of fuel, the great horses stand.  They strain forward, they recoil"
3667,VENICE,"even when starting, they raise one foot and hold it lifted, and all"
3668,VENICE,"about them the stones of the jewelled church writhe, and convolute,"
3669,VENICE,"and glisten, and dash the foam of their tendrils against the clear"
3670,VENICE,curve of the moulded flanks.
3671,VENICE,
3672,VENICE,
3673,VENICE,"The Treaty of Campo Formio!  A mask stripped off a Carnival figure,"
3674,VENICE,"and behold, the sneering face of death!  What of the creed the French"
3675,VENICE,"were bringing the Venetians!  Was it greed after all, or has a seed"
3676,VENICE,"been sown?  If so, the flowering will be long delayed.  The French"
3677,VENICE,"are leaving us, and almost we wish they would remain.  For Austria!"
3678,VENICE,What does it matter that the _Bucentoro_ is broken up; the lions from
3679,VENICE,"the Piræus loaded into a vessel; books, parchments, pictures, packed"
3680,VENICE,in travelling cases!  What does anything matter!  A gondolier snaps
3681,VENICE,"his fingers: ""_Francese non tutti ladri, ma Buona-parte!_""  Hush, my"
3682,VENICE,"friend, that is a dangerous remark, for Madame Bonaparte has"
3683,VENICE,"descended upon Venice in a whirlwind of laughter, might have made"
3684,VENICE,friends had she not been received in an overturned storehouse.  But
3685,VENICE,"she stays only three days, and the song of the gondoliers who row her"
3686,VENICE,"away can scarcely be heard for the hammering they make, putting up an"
3687,VENICE,immense scaffolding in front of Saint Mark's Church.  They have
3688,VENICE,"erected poles too, and tackle.  It is an awful nuisance, for soldiers"
3689,VENICE,"are not skilled in carpenter work, and no Venetian will lend a hand."
3690,VENICE,A grand ship sails for Toulon as soon as the horses are on board.
3691,VENICE,
3692,VENICE,"Golden horses, at last you leave your pedestals, you swing in the"
3693,VENICE,"blue-and-silver air, you paw the reflections flung by rippled water,"
3694,VENICE,and the starved pigeons whirl about you chattering.
3695,VENICE,"One--one--one--one!  The tackle creaks, the little squeaks of the"
3696,VENICE,pigeons are sharp and pitiful.  A gash in the front of the great
3697,VENICE,Church.  A blank window framing nothing.  The leaves of the
3698,VENICE,"sculptures curl, the swirling angels mount steadily, the star of"
3699,VENICE,"Christ is the pointed jet of a flame, but the horses drop--drop--"
3700,VENICE,"They descend slowly, they jerk, and stop, and start again, and"
3701,VENICE,one--one--one--one--they touch the pavement.  Women throw shawls over
3702,VENICE,their heads and weep; men pull off their caps and mutter prayers and
3703,VENICE,imprecations.  Then silently they form into a procession and march
3704,VENICE,"after the hand-carts, down to the quay, down to the waiting vessel."
3705,VENICE,"Slow feet following to a grave.  Here is a sign, but hardly of joy."
3706,VENICE,"This is a march of mourning.  Depart, vessel, draw out over the"
3707,VENICE,"bright Lagoon, grow faint, vague, blur and disappear.  The murder is"
3708,VENICE,accomplished.  To-morrow come the Austrians.

3714,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,_Then the energy which peoples the Earth crystallized into a single
3715,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"man.  And this man was Water, and Fire, and Flesh.  His core had the"
3716,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"strength of metal, and the hardness of metal was in his actions, and"
3717,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,upon him the sun struck as upon polished metal.  So he went to and
3718,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"fro among the nations, gleaming as with jewels.  Of himself were the"
3719,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"monuments he erected, and his laws were engraved tablets of fairest"
3720,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,bronze.  But there grew a great terror among the lesser peoples of
3721,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"the Earth, and they ran hither and yon like the ants, they swarmed"
3722,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"like beetles, and they saw themselves impotent, merely making tracks"
3723,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"in sand.  Now as speed is heat, so did this man soften with the haste"
3724,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"of his going.  For Fire is supreme even over metal, and the Fire in"
3725,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"him overcame the strong metal, so that his limbs failed, and his"
3726,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"brain was hot and molten.  Then was he consumed, but those of his"
3727,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"monuments which harboured not Fire, and were without spirit, and"
3728,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"cold, these endured.  In the midst of leaping flame, they kept their"
3729,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"semblances, and turning many colours in heat, still they cooled as"
3730,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"the Fire cooled.  For metal is unassailable from without, only a"
3731,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,spark in the mid-most circle can force a double action which pours it
3732,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"into Water, and volatilizes it into Air, and sifts it to ashes which"
3733,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"are Earth.  For man can fashion effigies, but the spark of Life he"
3734,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,can neither infuse nor control._

3736,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"_As a sharp sun this man passed across his century, and of the"

3738,_BONFIRES BURN PURPLE_,"streets of his city, but others have returned whence he gathered"

3746,VENICE AGAIN,"Sunday evening, May 23, 1915.  A beautiful Sunday evening with the"
3747,VENICE AGAIN,"Lagoon just going purple, and the angel on the tip of the new"
3748,VENICE AGAIN,Campanile dissolved to a spurt of crocus-coloured flame.  Up into the
3749,VENICE AGAIN,"plum-green sky mount the angels of the Basilica of Saint Mark, their"
3750,VENICE AGAIN,"wings, curved up and feathered to the fragility of a blowing leaf,"
3751,VENICE AGAIN,making incisive stabs of whiteness against the sky.
3752,VENICE AGAIN,
3753,VENICE AGAIN,"An organ moans in the great nave, and the high voices of choristers"
3754,VENICE AGAIN,float out through the open door and surge down the long Piazza.  The
3755,VENICE AGAIN,"chugging of a motor-boat breaks into the chant, swirls it, churns"
3756,VENICE AGAIN,"upon it, and fades to a distant pulsing down the Grand Canal.  The"
3757,VENICE AGAIN,"Campanile angel goes suddenly crimson, pales to rose, dies out in"
3758,VENICE AGAIN,"lilac, and remains dark, almost invisible, until the starting of"
3759,VENICE AGAIN,stars behind it gives it a new solidity in hiding them.
3760,VENICE AGAIN,
3761,VENICE AGAIN,"In the warm twilight, the little white tables of the Café Florian are"
3762,VENICE AGAIN,like petals dropped from the rose of the moon.  For a moment they are
3763,VENICE AGAIN,"weird and magical, but the abrupt glare of electric lights touches"
3764,VENICE AGAIN,"them back into mere tables: mere tables, flecked with coffee-cups and"
3765,VENICE AGAIN,"liqueur-glasses; mere tables, crumpling the lower halves of"
3766,VENICE AGAIN,"newspapers with their hard edges; mere tables, where gesticulating"
3767,VENICE AGAIN,"arms rest their elbows, and ice-cream plates nearly meet disaster in"
3768,VENICE AGAIN,the excitement of a heated discussion.  Venice discusses.  What will
3769,VENICE AGAIN,the Government do?  Austria has asked that her troops might cross
3770,VENICE AGAIN,"over Italian territory, South of Switzerland, in order to attack the"
3771,VENICE AGAIN,"French frontier.  Austria!  ""I tell you, Luigi, that alliance the"
3772,VENICE AGAIN,Government made with the Central Powers was a ghastly blunder.  You
3773,VENICE AGAIN,could never have got Italians to fight on the side of Austrians.
3774,VENICE AGAIN,"Blood is thicker than ink, fortunately.  But we are ready, thanks to"
3775,VENICE AGAIN,"Commandante Cadorna.  It was a foregone conclusion, ever since we"

3782,VENICE AGAIN,"Luigi.  It's declared.  Italy at war with Austria again.  Thank God,"
3783,VENICE AGAIN,"we've wiped off the stain of that abominable treaty.""  With heads"
3784,VENICE AGAIN,"bared, the crowd stands, and shouts, and cheers, and the pigeons"
3785,VENICE AGAIN,fleer away in frightened circles to the sculptured porticoes of the
3786,VENICE AGAIN,Basilica.  The crowd bursts into a sweeping song.  A great patriotic
3787,VENICE AGAIN,"chorus.  It echoes from side to side of the Piazza, it runs down the"
3788,VENICE AGAIN,"colonnades of the Procuratie like a splashing tide, it dashes upon"
3789,VENICE AGAIN,the arched portals of Saint Mark's and flicks upward in jets of
3790,VENICE AGAIN,"broken music.  Wild, shooting, rolling music; vibrant, solemn,"
3791,VENICE AGAIN,dedicated music; throbbing music flung out of loud-pounding hearts.
3792,VENICE AGAIN,The Piazza holds the sound of it and lifts it up as one raises an
3793,VENICE AGAIN,"offering before an altar.  Higher--higher--the song is lifted, it"
3794,VENICE AGAIN,engulfs the four golden horses over the centre door of the church.
3795,VENICE AGAIN,The horses are as brazen cymbals crashing back the great song in a
3796,VENICE AGAIN,"cadence of struck metal, the carven capitals are fluted reeds to this"
3797,VENICE AGAIN,"mighty anthem, the architraves bandy it to and fro in revolving"
3798,VENICE AGAIN,"canons of harmony.  Up, up, spires the song, and the mounting angels"
3799,VENICE AGAIN,call it to one another in an ascending scale even to the star of fire
3800,VENICE AGAIN,"on the topmost pinnacle which is the Christ, even into the distant"
3801,VENICE AGAIN,"sky where it curves up and over falling down to the four horizons, to"
3802,VENICE AGAIN,"the highest point of the aconite-blue sky, the sky of the Kingdom of"
3803,VENICE AGAIN,Italy.
3804,VENICE AGAIN,
3805,VENICE AGAIN,Garibaldi's Hymn!  For war is declared and Italy has joined the

3809,VENICE AGAIN,"Soft night falling upon Venice.  Summer night over the moon-city, the"

3811,VENICE AGAIN,"waters, your star-blossoms will be quenched, the strings of your"
3812,VENICE AGAIN,"guitars will snap and slacken.  Nights, you will gird on strange"
3813,VENICE AGAIN,"armour, and grow loud and strident.  But now--  The gilded horses"
3814,VENICE AGAIN,"shimmer above the portico of Saint Mark's!  How still they are, and"
3815,VENICE AGAIN,"powerful.  Pride, motion, activity set in a frozen patience."
3816,VENICE AGAIN,
3817,VENICE AGAIN,Suddenly--Boom!  A signal gun.  Then immediately the shrill shriek of
3818,VENICE AGAIN,"a steam whistle, and another, and whistles and whistles, from"
3819,VENICE AGAIN,"factories and boats, yawling, snarling, mewling, screeching, a"
3820,VENICE AGAIN,cracked cacophony of horror.
3821,VENICE AGAIN,
3822,VENICE AGAIN,Minutes--one--two--three--and the batteries of the Aerial-Guard
3823,VENICE AGAIN,"Station begin to fire.  Shells--red and black, white and"
3824,VENICE AGAIN,"grey--bellow, snap, and crash into the blue-black sky.  A whirr--the"
3825,VENICE AGAIN,Italian planes are rising.  Their white centre lights throw a halo
3826,VENICE AGAIN,"about them, and, tip and tip, a red light and a green, spark out to a"
3827,VENICE AGAIN,"great spread, closing together as the planes gain in altitude.  Up"
3828,VENICE AGAIN,"they go, the red, white, and green circles underneath their wings and"
3829,VENICE AGAIN,on either side of the fan-tails bright in the glow of the white
3830,VENICE AGAIN,"centre light.  Up, up, slanting in mounting circles.  ""Holy Mother of"
3831,VENICE AGAIN,"God!  What is it?""  Taubes over the city, flying at a great height,"
3832,VENICE AGAIN,flying in a wedge like a flight of wild geese.  Boom!  The
3833,VENICE AGAIN,anti-aircraft guns are flinging up strings of luminous balls.  Range
3834,VENICE AGAIN,"10,000 feet, try 10,500.  Loud detonations, echoing far over the"
3835,VENICE AGAIN,Lagoon.  The navigation lights of the Italian planes are a faint
3836,VENICE AGAIN,"triangle of bright dots.  They climb in deliberate spirals, up and"
3837,VENICE AGAIN,"up, up and up.  They seem to hang.  They hover without direction."
3838,VENICE AGAIN,"Ah, there are the Taubes, specks dotting the beam of a search-light."
3839,VENICE AGAIN,One of them is banking.  Two Italian machines dart up over him.  He
3840,VENICE AGAIN,"spins, round--round--top-whirling, sleeping in speed, to us below he"
3841,VENICE AGAIN,"seems stationary.  Pup-pup-pup-pup-pup--machine-guns, clicking like"
3842,VENICE AGAIN,"distant typewriters, firing with indescribable rapidity.  The Italian"
3843,VENICE AGAIN,"planes drop signal balloons, they hang in the air like suspended"
3844,VENICE AGAIN,"sky-rockets, they float down, amber balls, steadily burning.  The"
3845,VENICE AGAIN,"ground guns answer, and white buds of smoke appear in the sky.  They"
3846,VENICE AGAIN,"seem to blossom out of darkness, silver roses beyond the silver shaft"
3847,VENICE AGAIN,of the search-light.  The air is broken with noise: thunder-drumming
3848,VENICE AGAIN,"of cannon, sharp pocking of machine-guns, snap and crack of rifles."
3849,VENICE AGAIN,"Above, the specks loop, and glide, and zig-zag.  The spinning Taube"
3850,VENICE AGAIN,"nose-dives, recovers, and zums upward, topping its adversary."
3851,VENICE AGAIN,"Another Taube swoops in over a Nieuport and wags its tail, spraying"
3852,VENICE AGAIN,"lead bullets into the Italian in a wide, wing-and-wing arc.  The sky"
3853,VENICE AGAIN,"is bitten red with stinging shrapnel.  Two machines charge head on,"
3854,VENICE AGAIN,the Taube swerves and rams the right wing of the Nieuport.  Flame!
3855,VENICE AGAIN,"Flame leaping and dropping.  A smear from zenith to--following it,"
3856,VENICE AGAIN,"the eye hits the shadow of a roof.  Blackness.  One poor devil gone,"
3857,VENICE AGAIN,and the attacking plane is still airworthy though damaged.  It
3858,VENICE AGAIN,"wobbles out of the search-light and disappears, rocking.  Two Taubes"
3859,VENICE AGAIN,"shake themselves free of the tangle, they glide down--down--all round"
3860,VENICE AGAIN,"them are ribbons of ""flaming onions,"" they avoid them and pass on"
3861,VENICE AGAIN,"down, close over the city, unscathed, so close you can see the black"
3862,VENICE AGAIN,crosses on their wings with a glass.  Rifles crack at them from
3863,VENICE AGAIN,roofs.  Pooh!  You might as well try to stop them with pea-shooters.
3864,VENICE AGAIN,"They curve, turn, and hang up-wind.  Small shells beat about them"
3865,VENICE AGAIN,"with a report like twanged harp-strings.  ""_Klar sum Werfen?_"""
3866,VENICE AGAIN,"""_Jawohl._""  ""_Gut dock, werfen._""  Words cannot carry down thousands"
3867,VENICE AGAIN,"of feet, but the ominous hovering is a sort of speech.  People wring"
3868,VENICE AGAIN,"their hands and clutch their throats, some cover their ears."
3869,VENICE AGAIN,Z-z-z-z-z!  That whine would pierce any covering.  The bomb has
3870,VENICE AGAIN,"passed below the roofs.  Nothing.  A pause.  Then a report, breaking"
3871,VENICE AGAIN,"the hearing, leaving only the apprehension of a great light and no"
3872,VENICE AGAIN,sound.  They have hit us!  _Misericordia_!  They have hit Venice!
3873,VENICE AGAIN,"One--two--four--ten bombs.  People sob and pray, the water lashes the"
3874,VENICE AGAIN,"Rivas as though there were a storm.  Another machine falls, shooting"
3875,VENICE AGAIN,"down in silence.  It is not on fire, it merely falls.  Then slowly"
3876,VENICE AGAIN,"the Taubes draw off.  The search-light shifts, seeking them.  The"
3877,VENICE AGAIN,gun-fire is spaced more widely.  Field-glasses fail to show even a
3878,VENICE AGAIN,speck.  There is silence.  The silence of a pulse which has stopped.
3879,VENICE AGAIN,But the people walk in the brightness of fire.  Fire from the Rio
3880,VENICE AGAIN,"della Tanna, from the Rio del Carmine, from the quarter of Santa"
3881,VENICE AGAIN,"Lucia.  Bells peal in a fury, fire-boats hurry with forced engines"
3882,VENICE AGAIN,"along the canals.  Water streams jet upon the fire; and, in the"
3883,VENICE AGAIN,"golden light, the glittering horses of Saint Mark's pace forward,"
3884,VENICE AGAIN,"silent, calm, determined in their advance, above the portal of the"
3885,VENICE AGAIN,untouched church.
3886,VENICE AGAIN,
3887,VENICE AGAIN,"The night turns grey, and silver, and opens into a blue morning."
3888,VENICE AGAIN,"Diamond roses sparkle on the Lagoon, but the people passing quickly"
3889,VENICE AGAIN,"through the Piazza are grim, and workmen sniff the smoky air as they"
3890,VENICE AGAIN,"fix ladders and arrange tools.  Venice has tasted war.  ""_Evviva"
3891,VENICE AGAIN,"Italia!_"""
3892,VENICE AGAIN,
3893,VENICE AGAIN,"City of soft colours, of amber and violet, you are turning"
3894,VENICE AGAIN,"grey-green, and grey-green are the uniforms of the troops who defend"
3895,VENICE AGAIN,"you.  The Bersaglieri still wear their cocks' feathers, but they are"
3896,VENICE AGAIN,"green too, and black.  Black as the guns mounted on pontoons among"
3897,VENICE AGAIN,"the Lagoons before Venice, green as the bundles of reeds camouflaging"
3898,VENICE AGAIN,them from Austrian observation balloons.  Drag up metre after metre
3899,VENICE AGAIN,"of grey-green cloth, stretch it over the five golden domes of Saint"
3900,VENICE AGAIN,"Mark's Basilica.  Hood their splendour in umbrella bags of cloth, so"
3901,VENICE AGAIN,that not one glint shall answer the mocking shimmer of the moon.
3902,VENICE AGAIN,"Barrows and barrows of nails for the wooden bastion of the Basilica,"
3903,VENICE AGAIN,hods and hods of mortar and narrow bricks to cover the old mosaics of
3904,VENICE AGAIN,"the lunettes.  Cart-loads of tar and planking, and heaps, heaps,"
3905,VENICE AGAIN,"hills and mountains of sand--the Lido protecting Venice, as it has"
3906,VENICE AGAIN,"done for hundreds of years.  They shovel sand, scoop sand, pour sand,"
3907,VENICE AGAIN,into bags and bags and bags.  Thousands of bags piled against the
3908,VENICE AGAIN,"bases of columns, rising in front of carved corners, blotting out"
3909,VENICE AGAIN,"altars, throttling the open points of arches.  Porphyries,"
3910,VENICE AGAIN,"malachites, and jades are squarely boarded, pulpits and fonts"
3911,VENICE AGAIN,disappear in swaddling bands.  Why?  The battle front is forty miles
3912,VENICE AGAIN,"away in Friuli, and Venice is not a fortified town.  Why?  Answer,"
3913,VENICE AGAIN,"Reims!  Bear witness, Ypres!  Do they cover Venice without reason?"
3914,VENICE AGAIN,"Nietzsche was a German, still I believe they read him in Vienna."
3915,VENICE AGAIN,"Blood and Iron!  And is there not also Blood and Stone, Blood and"
3916,VENICE AGAIN,"Bronze, Blood and Canvas?  ""Kultur,"" Venetians, in the Rio del"
3917,VENICE AGAIN,Carmine; there is no time to lose.  Take down the great ceiling
3918,VENICE AGAIN,pictures in the Ducal Palace and wrap them on cylinders.  Build a
3919,VENICE AGAIN,"high trestle, and fashion little go-carts which draw with string."
3920,VENICE AGAIN,
3921,VENICE AGAIN,Hush!  They are coming--the four beautiful horses.  They rise in a
3922,VENICE AGAIN,whirl of disturbed pigeons.  They float and descend.  The people
3923,VENICE AGAIN,"watch in silence as, one after another, they reach the ground."
3924,VENICE AGAIN,"Across the tiles they step at last, each pulled in a go-cart;"
3925,VENICE AGAIN,"merry-go-round horses, detached and solitary, one foot raised, tramp"
3926,VENICE AGAIN,"over chequered stones, over chequered centuries.  The merry-go-round"
3927,VENICE AGAIN,"of years has brought them full circle, for are they not returning to"
3928,VENICE AGAIN,Rome?
3929,VENICE AGAIN,
3930,VENICE AGAIN,For how long?  Ask the guns embedded in the snow of glaciers; ask the
3931,VENICE AGAIN,"rivers pierced from their beds, overflowing marshes and meadows,"
3932,VENICE AGAIN,forming a new sea.  Seek the answer in the faces of the Grenatieri
3933,VENICE AGAIN,"Brigade, dying to a man, but halting the invaders.  Demand it of the"

3935,VENICE AGAIN,the reply in the dryness of those eyes which gaze upon the wreck of
3936,VENICE AGAIN,Tiepolo's ceiling in the Church of the Scalzi.  Yet not in Italy
3937,VENICE AGAIN,"alone shall you find it.  The ring of searching must be widened, and"
