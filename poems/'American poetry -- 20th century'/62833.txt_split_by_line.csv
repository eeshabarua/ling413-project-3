288,BLACK EARTH,when it climbs out on the bank to experience the
289,BLACK EARTH,
290,BLACK EARTH,"sun, I do these"
291,BLACK EARTH,"things which I do, which please"
292,BLACK EARTH,no one but myself. Now I breathe and now I am sub-
293,BLACK EARTH,merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object
294,BLACK EARTH,
295,BLACK EARTH,in view was a
296,BLACK EARTH,renaissance; shall I say
297,BLACK EARTH,the contrary? The sediment of the river which
298,BLACK EARTH,"encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used"
299,BLACK EARTH,

304,BLACK EARTH,

309,BLACK EARTH,
310,BLACK EARTH,can filter—cut
311,BLACK EARTH,into checkers by rut
312,BLACK EARTH,upon rut of unpreventable experience—
313,BLACK EARTH,it is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the
314,BLACK EARTH,
315,BLACK EARTH,hairy toed. Black
316,BLACK EARTH,"but beautiful, my back"
317,BLACK EARTH,is full of the history of power. Of power? What
318,BLACK EARTH,is powerful and what is not? My soul shall never
319,BLACK EARTH,
320,BLACK EARTH,be cut into
321,BLACK EARTH,by a wooden spear; through-
322,BLACK EARTH,"out childhood to the present time, the unity of"
323,BLACK EARTH,life and death has been expressed by the circumference
324,BLACK EARTH,
325,BLACK EARTH,described by my
326,BLACK EARTH,"trunk; nevertheless, I"
327,BLACK EARTH,perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after
328,BLACK EARTH,"all; and I am on my guard; external poise, it"
329,BLACK EARTH,
330,BLACK EARTH,has its centre
331,BLACK EARTH,well nurtured—we know
332,BLACK EARTH,"where—in pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where?"
333,BLACK EARTH,My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of
334,BLACK EARTH,
335,BLACK EARTH,the wind. I see
336,BLACK EARTH,"and I hear, unlike the"
337,BLACK EARTH,"wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made"
338,BLACK EARTH,to see and not to see; to hear and not to hear;
339,BLACK EARTH,
340,BLACK EARTH,that tree trunk without
341,BLACK EARTH,"roots, accustomed to shout"
342,BLACK EARTH,"its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact"
343,BLACK EARTH,by who knows what strange pressure of the atmosphere; that
344,BLACK EARTH,
345,BLACK EARTH,spiritual
346,BLACK EARTH,brother to the coral
347,BLACK EARTH,"plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light"
348,BLACK EARTH,becomes a nebulous green. The I of each is to
349,BLACK EARTH,
350,BLACK EARTH,"the I of each,"
351,BLACK EARTH,a kind of fretful speech
352,BLACK EARTH,which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is?
353,BLACK EARTH,Black earth preceded by a tendril? It is to that
354,BLACK EARTH,
355,BLACK EARTH,phenomenon
356,BLACK EARTH,"the above formation,"
357,BLACK EARTH,translucent like the atmosphere—a cortex merely—
358,BLACK EARTH,that on which darts cannot strike decisively the first
359,BLACK EARTH,
360,BLACK EARTH,"time, a substance"
