217,HEREDITY,
218,HEREDITY,That he who wrote before thee labored well
219,HEREDITY,Concerns thee not: thy work for thee must tell;
220,HEREDITY,’Tis naught to thee if others’ tasks were ill:

862,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Where the breeze of morning beat
863,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"’Gainst her face, demure and sweet,"
864,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Sat a girl of long ago,"
865,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,With her sunny head bent low
866,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Where her fingers flitted white
867,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Through a maze of patchwork bright.
868,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,
869,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Wondrous hues the rare quilt bears!
870,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,All the clothes the household wears
871,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,By their fragments may be traced
872,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,In that bright mosaic placed;
873,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Pieces given by friend and neighbor,"
874,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Blended by her curious labor
875,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"With the grandame’s gown of gray,"
876,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,And the silken bonnet gay
877,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"That the baby’s head hath crowned,"
878,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,In the quaint design are found.
879,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,
880,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Did she aught suspect or dream,"
881,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"As she sewed each dainty seam,"
882,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,That a haunted thing she wrought?
883,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,That each linsey scrap was fraught
884,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"With some tender memory,"
885,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Which, in distant years to be,"
886,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Would lost hopes and loves recall,"

892,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Of the quilt’s antique design,"
893,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"As she folds it, soft and warm,"
894,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Round a fair child’s sleeping form.
895,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Lustrous is her lifted gaze
896,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,As with half-voiced words she prays
897,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,That the bright head on that quilt
898,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"May not bow in shame or guilt,"
899,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,And the little feet below
900,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Darksome paths may never know.
901,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,
902,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Yet again the morning shines
903,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,On the patch-work’s squares and lines;
904,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Dull and dim its colors show,"
905,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"But more dim the eyes that glow,"
906,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Wandering with a dreamy glance
907,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,O’er the ancient quilt’s expanse;
908,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Worn its textures are and frayed,"
909,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"But the hands upon them laid,"
910,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Creased with toils of many a year,"
911,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Still more worn and old appear.
912,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,
913,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"But what hands, long-loved and dead,"
914,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Do those faded fingers, spread"
915,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"O’er those faded fabrics, meet"
916,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,In reunion fond and sweet!
917,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,
918,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,What past scenes of tenderness
919,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"And of joy that none may guess,"
920,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Called back by the patchwork old,"
921,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Do those darkening eyes behold!
922,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Lo, the deathless past comes near!"
923,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,From the silence whisper clear
924,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,"Long-hushed tones, and, changing not,"
925,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,Forms and faces unforgot
926,THE PATCHWORK QUILT,In their old-time grace and bloom
