136,CONTENTS,There is an old woman
137,CONTENTS,Who ought to die--

139,CONTENTS,Deacon:
140,CONTENTS,And nobody knows
141,CONTENTS,But what she's dead--
142,CONTENTS,
143,CONTENTS,Doctor:
144,CONTENTS,The air will be cleaner
145,CONTENTS,When she's gone--
146,CONTENTS,
147,CONTENTS,Deacon:
148,CONTENTS,But we dare not bury her
149,CONTENTS,Till she's dead--

151,CONTENTS,Landlady:
152,CONTENTS,"Come, young doctor"
153,CONTENTS,"From the first floor front,"
154,CONTENTS,"Come, dusty deacon,"

158,CONTENTS,
159,CONTENTS,Doctor and Deacon:
160,CONTENTS,We'll carry her
161,CONTENTS,And bury her

164,CONTENTS,House:
165,CONTENTS,They roll her up
166,CONTENTS,"In her old, red quilt,"
167,CONTENTS,They carry her down
168,CONTENTS,"At a horizontal tilt,"

179,CONTENTS,
180,CONTENTS,Deacon:
181,CONTENTS,Let's hurry away
182,CONTENTS,And never look behind
183,CONTENTS,To see if her eyes
184,CONTENTS,"Are dead and blind,"
185,CONTENTS,To see if the quilt
186,CONTENTS,Lies over her face--
187,CONTENTS,Perhaps she'll groan
188,CONTENTS,Or move in her place!
189,CONTENTS,
190,CONTENTS,House:
191,CONTENTS,The room is empty
192,CONTENTS,"Where the old woman lay,"

194,CONTENTS,Smell like a tomb--

209,CONTENTS,A pretty little lady
210,CONTENTS,Comes to see--
211,CONTENTS,
212,CONTENTS,Woman:
213,CONTENTS,"Oh, what a dark room,"
214,CONTENTS,Not for me!
215,CONTENTS,
216,CONTENTS,Landlady:
217,CONTENTS,The room is large
218,CONTENTS,"And the rent is low,"
219,CONTENTS,There's a deacon above
220,CONTENTS,And a doctor below--
221,CONTENTS,
222,CONTENTS,Deacon:
223,CONTENTS,When the little mice squeak
224,CONTENTS,I shall pray--
225,CONTENTS,
226,CONTENTS,Doctor:
227,CONTENTS,I'll psycho-analyse
228,CONTENTS,The ghosts away--

236,CONTENTS,Woman:
237,CONTENTS,But here's the door
238,CONTENTS,Without a key!
239,CONTENTS,An unlocked room
240,CONTENTS,Won't do for me!
241,CONTENTS,
242,CONTENTS,Doctor:
243,CONTENTS,Here's a bolt--
244,CONTENTS,
245,CONTENTS,Deacon:
246,CONTENTS,And here's a bar--

248,CONTENTS,Landlady:

262,CONTENTS,Deacon:
263,CONTENTS,"Good night, madam,"
264,CONTENTS,I'll steal away--

269,CONTENTS,
270,CONTENTS,House:
271,CONTENTS,She lights a candle--
272,CONTENTS,What do I see!
273,CONTENTS,That cloak looks like
274,CONTENTS,A quilt to me!
275,CONTENTS,She climbs into bed
276,CONTENTS,"Where long she's lain,"
277,CONTENTS,"She's come back home,"
278,CONTENTS,She won't leave again.
279,CONTENTS,She's found once more
280,CONTENTS,"Her rightful place,"
281,CONTENTS,Same old lady
282,CONTENTS,With a pretty new face.
283,CONTENTS,Let the deacon pray
284,CONTENTS,"And the doctor talk,"
285,CONTENTS,The mice will squeak
286,CONTENTS,And the ghosts will walk.
287,CONTENTS,There's a crafty smile
288,CONTENTS,"On the landlady's face,"
289,CONTENTS,"The old woman's gone,"
290,CONTENTS,But she's filled her place!
291,CONTENTS,
292,CONTENTS,Landlady:
293,CONTENTS,It's nothing to me
294,CONTENTS,"If the old woman's dead,"
295,CONTENTS,There's somebody sleeping
296,CONTENTS,In every bed!

312,I,Of great charity--

324,II,For to your heart
325,II,"Beauty is a burned-out torch,"
326,II,"And Faith, a blind pigeon,"
327,II,"Friendship, a curious Persian myth,"
328,II,"And Love, blank emptiness,"

340,III,Of flesh or spirit?
341,III,I only know to me
342,III,Your eyes are wholly you.
343,III,
344,III,Our glances dart
345,III,Like the flash of a bird
346,III,"Gone, before the colour of his wing"
347,III,Is seen.

349,III,I have not bathed my soul
350,III,"In your eyes,"

363,IV,
364,IV,"My arms reach toward illusion,"
365,IV,"And I would carry mist against my heart,"

426,I. PRELUDE,Aid in your brave attempt to smother youth?
427,I. PRELUDE,"Of what avail that trifling circumstance,"

464,III. POSTLUDE,"Of shining music, luminous and grave,"
465,III. POSTLUDE,"Lifting against me, pouring through me, here"
466,III. POSTLUDE,"Find wafts of unforgotten chords, which rise"
467,III. POSTLUDE,"And droop like clinging sea-weed. You, so white,"
468,III. POSTLUDE,"So still, so helpless on this fathomless night"
469,III. POSTLUDE,"Float like a corpse with living, tortured eyes."
470,III. POSTLUDE,Deep waves wash you against me; you impart
471,III. POSTLUDE,"No comfort to my spirit, give no sign"
472,III. POSTLUDE,Your inarticulate lips can taste the brine

482,III. POSTLUDE,"Your eager lips, athirst to drain"
483,III. POSTLUDE,Life's goblet of its golden wine
484,III. POSTLUDE,Shall drink tonight or thirst in vain--
485,III. POSTLUDE,I hold you fast for you are mine.
486,III. POSTLUDE,
487,III. POSTLUDE,And when I search your soul until
488,III. POSTLUDE,I see too deeply and divine
489,III. POSTLUDE,That you can never love me--Still

500,III. POSTLUDE,I marvel greatly that it fail
501,III. POSTLUDE,To glow and pale
502,III. POSTLUDE,With iridescent light--
503,III. POSTLUDE,How can it hang in silent nun-like folds?
504,III. POSTLUDE,"Think of the flaming mystery it holds,"
505,III. POSTLUDE,You... You...
506,III. POSTLUDE,
507,III. POSTLUDE,We stand in that wide place
508,III. POSTLUDE,"Where love is frozen in marble, spire on spire,"
509,III. POSTLUDE,A snow-white nightingale with a heart of fire
510,III. POSTLUDE,Soaring in space.
511,III. POSTLUDE,"We gaze, together, into the shining pool"
512,III. POSTLUDE,To catch the soul of beauty unaware
513,III. POSTLUDE,Finding only the peaceful body there
514,III. POSTLUDE,Of beauty drowned and still in waters cool.
515,III. POSTLUDE,
516,III. POSTLUDE,Burning so luminously in these pure white things
517,III. POSTLUDE,"Somehow akin, are palpitating fires,"
518,III. POSTLUDE,
519,III. POSTLUDE,"Intangible, yet visible as spires"
520,III. POSTLUDE,Or wings.
521,III. POSTLUDE,"And close at hand, an unseen Moslem sings"
522,III. POSTLUDE,"Blind, haunting chants, which speak"
523,III. POSTLUDE,"Of mystery, forevermore unguessed."
524,III. POSTLUDE,"O shining ones, I seek"
525,III. POSTLUDE,"No farther, for my soul, content,"

531,III. POSTLUDE,The Gift
532,III. POSTLUDE,
533,III. POSTLUDE,What is this wine you have poured for me?
534,III. POSTLUDE,You have offered up
535,III. POSTLUDE,Your face in its pure transparency
536,III. POSTLUDE,Like a crystal cup
537,III. POSTLUDE,Which trembling fingers slowly lift--
538,III. POSTLUDE,It is faintly masked
539,III. POSTLUDE,"With a tremulous smile. You have brought me a gift,"
540,III. POSTLUDE,"Your love, unasked."
541,III. POSTLUDE,
542,III. POSTLUDE,Could you trust my reckless hands so much?
543,III. POSTLUDE,"With no vow spoken,"
544,III. POSTLUDE,"You gave me a goblet, which at a touch"
545,III. POSTLUDE,Were utterly broken!
546,III. POSTLUDE,"Your smile replied: ""Since the glass was filled"
547,III. POSTLUDE,It little mattered
548,III. POSTLUDE,Whether the wine were drunk or spilled
549,III. POSTLUDE,"Or the goblet shattered."""

552,III. POSTLUDE,
553,III. POSTLUDE,I walk the bridge of hours from dawn till night
554,III. POSTLUDE,My heart beating so loud in joyous wonder
555,III. POSTLUDE,"To know your love, that I can scarcely breathe;"
556,III. POSTLUDE,"But in the lonely darkness, with affright"
557,III. POSTLUDE,"I faintly hear, like ominous, distant thunder"
558,III. POSTLUDE,The unseen ocean surging close beneath.
559,III. POSTLUDE,
560,III. POSTLUDE,"Our bridge so frail, eternity so vast!"
561,III. POSTLUDE,When we must sink into the deep at last
562,III. POSTLUDE,"Heart of my heart, will you still hold me fast?"

867,V,"Their claws curl loosely, safely, about nothingness,"
868,V,They clasp no things.
869,V,Direction and desire they possess

952,V,Offering useful tin-ware
953,V,For all the ancient metal
954,V,You have left to rust
955,V,"In the dim, dusty attic"
956,V,Or mouldy cellar
957,V,Of your soul.
958,V,
959,V,He refuses nothing--
960,V,Rusty nails
961,V,Which may have played their part
962,V,In a crucifixion--
963,V,For ten of these he will give
964,V,A new tin spoon.

967,V,"Once guarding hearth-fires of content,"
968,V,Now dusty and forgotten

971,V,A new tin tea-kettle
972,V,With a wooden handle.
973,V,
974,V,And for this antique bowl
975,V,Fashioned to hold

1102,V. THE DREAM,He has forgiven
1103,V. THE DREAM,"My cowardice and hesitations,"
1104,V. THE DREAM,Soon I shall sink into his arms
1105,V. THE DREAM,With all the imagined fervour...
1106,V. THE DREAM,Of a thousand dreams.
1107,V. THE DREAM,
1108,V. THE DREAM,Why does he come so slowly?
1109,V. THE DREAM,There is no longer anything
1110,V. THE DREAM,To mar our meeting...
1111,V. THE DREAM,
1112,V. THE DREAM,This must be real
1113,V. THE DREAM,"For Harlequin is still clowning,"
1114,V. THE DREAM,He waves his arms grotesquely
1115,V. THE DREAM,To make me smile....
1116,V. THE DREAM,
1117,V. THE DREAM,"Quick, into his arms"
1118,V. THE DREAM,With unspent fervour.
1119,V. THE DREAM,Why are the trees all sighing?
1120,V. THE DREAM,"Look, whispering birches, if you will,"
1121,V. THE DREAM,I and my love embrace!
1122,V. THE DREAM,
1123,V. THE DREAM,"They do not look,"
1124,V. THE DREAM,They do not seem to care...
1125,V. THE DREAM,
1126,V. THE DREAM,"Embrace me, my beloved!"
1127,V. THE DREAM,(Can these by passionate kisses?
1128,V. THE DREAM,They feel so thin and cool
1129,V. THE DREAM,Like mist.)
1130,V. THE DREAM,
1131,V. THE DREAM,The birches shiver
1132,V. THE DREAM,As though the night-wind stirred them.
1133,V. THE DREAM,
1134,V. THE DREAM,Can we be dead?
1135,V. THE DREAM,
1136,V. THE DREAM,Portrait of a Gentleman
1137,V. THE DREAM,
1138,V. THE DREAM,Tower of stone
1139,V. THE DREAM,"Rugged and lonely,"
1140,V. THE DREAM,My thoughts like ivy
1141,V. THE DREAM,"Embrace my memory of you,"
1142,V. THE DREAM,"Climbing riotously, wantonly,"
1143,V. THE DREAM,Till the harsh walls
1144,V. THE DREAM,Are clothed in tender green.
1145,V. THE DREAM,
1146,V. THE DREAM,"Tower of stone,"
1147,V. THE DREAM,Stark walls and a narrow door
1148,V. THE DREAM,Which speak:
1149,V. THE DREAM,"""You who are not for me"
1150,V. THE DREAM,"Are against me,--"
1151,V. THE DREAM,"If you are mine,"
1152,V. THE DREAM,"Enter!"""
1153,V. THE DREAM,
1154,V. THE DREAM,But who would be prisoned
1155,V. THE DREAM,In unknown darkness?
1156,V. THE DREAM,
1157,V. THE DREAM,Tower of stone
1158,V. THE DREAM,"Rugged and lonely,"
1159,V. THE DREAM,I dared not enter and I would not go
1160,V. THE DREAM,Till clasping you
1161,V. THE DREAM,My arms were bruised and torn.
1162,V. THE DREAM,
1163,V. THE DREAM,From the Madison Street Police Station
1164,V. THE DREAM,
1165,V. THE DREAM,"I, John Shepherd, vagrant,"
1166,V. THE DREAM,Petition the park commissioners
1167,V. THE DREAM,For wider benches.
1168,V. THE DREAM,
1169,V. THE DREAM,My soul has long been reconciled
1170,V. THE DREAM,"To the prick of gunny-sack,"
1171,V. THE DREAM,(O well-remembered woollen fleeces!)
1172,V. THE DREAM,"And rustling vests of newspaper,"
1173,V. THE DREAM,"And the chill of rubbers on unshod feet,"
1174,V. THE DREAM,"But to the wasteful burning of dry leaves,"
1175,V. THE DREAM,"God's shepherd's mattress,"
1176,V. THE DREAM,Never!
1177,V. THE DREAM,
1178,V. THE DREAM,Descendant of ancient ones
1179,V. THE DREAM,"Who tended flocks and watched the midnight sky,"
1180,V. THE DREAM,My forebears saw the Eastern star appear
1181,V. THE DREAM,Over Judean hills.
1182,V. THE DREAM,
1183,V. THE DREAM,"Where do your flocks graze, gentlemen?"
1184,V. THE DREAM,Are there no sheep or shepherds any more?
1185,V. THE DREAM,All day long I sought the flocks
1186,V. THE DREAM,"And came by night to a wide, grassy place,"
1187,V. THE DREAM,Where I could sit and watch the stars wheel by--
1188,V. THE DREAM,And in the morning some one brought me here.
1189,V. THE DREAM,
1190,V. THE DREAM,La Felice
1191,V. THE DREAM,
1192,V. THE DREAM,"La Felice, by the forest pond"
1193,V. THE DREAM,looks through leaves to the Western screen
1194,V. THE DREAM,of Chinese gold that lies beyond
1195,V. THE DREAM,black trees and boughs of golden-green.
1196,V. THE DREAM,
1197,V. THE DREAM,The little body of La Felice
1198,V. THE DREAM,weary of everything on earth
1199,V. THE DREAM,"has passed from love to love, till peace"
1200,V. THE DREAM,and beauty alone have any worth.
1201,V. THE DREAM,
1202,V. THE DREAM,"So still and deep the water lies,"
1203,V. THE DREAM,"so fiery-cool, so yellow-clear;"
1204,V. THE DREAM,"Here beauty sleeps! La Felice cries,"
1205,V. THE DREAM,"I will give myself to beauty here!"""
1206,V. THE DREAM,
1207,V. THE DREAM,"The mud is smooth and deep, the weeds"
1208,V. THE DREAM,"beneath her feet are soft and cool,"
1209,V. THE DREAM,ripples widen and glistening beads
1210,V. THE DREAM,of bubble rise on the forest pool.
1211,V. THE DREAM,
1212,V. THE DREAM,"The water reaches to her knee,"
1213,V. THE DREAM,"now to her thigh, now to her breast,"
1214,V. THE DREAM,till like a child all peacefully
1215,V. THE DREAM,does La Felice lie down to rest.
1216,V. THE DREAM,
1217,V. THE DREAM,She struggles like a fearful bride
1218,V. THE DREAM,with ecstasy--then La Felice
1219,V. THE DREAM,turns quietly upon her side
1220,V. THE DREAM,and over the sunset pool is peace.
1221,V. THE DREAM,
1222,V. THE DREAM,The Journey
1223,V. THE DREAM,
1224,V. THE DREAM,Three women walked through the snow
1225,V. THE DREAM,"Beneath an empty sky,"
1226,V. THE DREAM,"And one was blind, and one was old,"
1227,V. THE DREAM,And one was I.
1228,V. THE DREAM,
1229,V. THE DREAM,"Bravely the Blind One led,"
1230,V. THE DREAM,I questioned from behind
1231,V. THE DREAM,"""Tell me, where do we go?"" She said"
1232,V. THE DREAM,"""Have courage... I am blind!"""
1233,V. THE DREAM,
1234,V. THE DREAM,"We came at last to a cliff,"
1235,V. THE DREAM,"The Blind One plunged, and was gone--"
1236,V. THE DREAM,"I looked behind me, stark and stiff"
1237,V. THE DREAM,The Old One stood in the dawn.
1238,V. THE DREAM,
1239,V. THE DREAM,The deep crevasse was black
1240,V. THE DREAM,"Beneath the dawning day,"
1241,V. THE DREAM,"I could not turn and travel back,"
1242,V. THE DREAM,The Old One barred the way.
1243,V. THE DREAM,
1244,V. THE DREAM,"I could not turn aside,"
1245,V. THE DREAM,"(To lead, one dare not see)"
1246,V. THE DREAM,I think that day I must have died
1247,V. THE DREAM,Such silence is in me.
1248,V. THE DREAM,
1249,V. THE DREAM,The Last Illusion
1250,V. THE DREAM,
1251,V. THE DREAM,"Along the twilight road I met three women,"
1252,V. THE DREAM,And they were neither old nor very young;
1253,V. THE DREAM,"In her hands each bore what she most cherished,"
1254,V. THE DREAM,"For they were neither rich, nor very poor."
1255,V. THE DREAM,
1256,V. THE DREAM,In the hands of the first woman
1257,V. THE DREAM,"I saw white ashes in an urn,"
1258,V. THE DREAM,In the hands of the next woman
1259,V. THE DREAM,"I saw a tarnished mirror gleam,"
1260,V. THE DREAM,In the hands of the last woman
1261,V. THE DREAM,"I saw a heavy, jagged stone--"
1262,V. THE DREAM,
1263,V. THE DREAM,"Along the twilight road I met three women,"
1264,V. THE DREAM,"And they were neither fools nor very wise,"
1265,V. THE DREAM,For each was troubled lest another covet
1266,V. THE DREAM,Her precious burden--so they walked alone.
1267,V. THE DREAM,
1268,V. THE DREAM,
1269,V. THE DREAM,The Desert
1270,V. THE DREAM,
1271,V. THE DREAM,"Through dusty years, and drearily,"
1272,V. THE DREAM,Two lovers rode across a desert hill
1273,V. THE DREAM,While patient love followed them wearily
1274,V. THE DREAM,"Through the long, sultry day..."
1275,V. THE DREAM,"But when night came, the desert had its way,"
1276,V. THE DREAM,"Turning, they found love cold and still."
1277,V. THE DREAM,
1278,V. THE DREAM,"It lay so pitiful a thing,"
1279,V. THE DREAM,"Threadbare, and soiled, and worn--"
1280,V. THE DREAM,"""Why have we kept such starveling love?"" she cried,"
1281,V. THE DREAM,"""Was it worth treasuring?"""
1282,V. THE DREAM,And he replied:
1283,V. THE DREAM,"""Bury it then! I shall not mourn!"""
1284,V. THE DREAM,
1285,V. THE DREAM,"The wind came from the West,"
1286,V. THE DREAM,It seemed to blow
1287,V. THE DREAM,Across a million graves to the sordid bier
1288,V. THE DREAM,"Where lay their love. She said: ""We will bury it here!"""
1289,V. THE DREAM,"They laid it low,"
1290,V. THE DREAM,"They rode on, dispossessed."
1291,V. THE DREAM,
1292,V. THE DREAM,And all around
1293,V. THE DREAM,"Rose silent hills against the darkening sky,"
1294,V. THE DREAM,Wave upon motionless wave.
1295,V. THE DREAM,The night wind made a mournful sound.
1296,V. THE DREAM,"The woman turned: ""It is lonely here!"
1297,V. THE DREAM,"I am afraid!"" she said."
1298,V. THE DREAM,He made reply:
1299,V. THE DREAM,"""What is there left to lose or save?"
1300,V. THE DREAM,What is there left to fear?
1301,V. THE DREAM,"Our hearts are empty. Have we not buried our dead?"""
1302,V. THE DREAM,"She said, ""I fear the empty dark, be kind!"""
1303,V. THE DREAM,"He said, ""I am still here, be comforted!"""
1304,V. THE DREAM,
1305,V. THE DREAM,Then from its shallow grave
1306,V. THE DREAM,Their love rose up and followed close behind.
1307,V. THE DREAM,
1308,V. THE DREAM,The Picnic
1309,V. THE DREAM,
1310,V. THE DREAM,"Here they come, in pairs, carrying baskets,"
1311,V. THE DREAM,"Pale clerks with brilliant neckties, and cheap serge suits,"
1312,V. THE DREAM,"Steering girls by the arm, clerks, too,"
1313,V. THE DREAM,"Pretty and slim and smart,"
1314,V. THE DREAM,"Even to yellow kid boots, laced up behind."
1315,V. THE DREAM,
1316,V. THE DREAM,"They take the electric cars far into the country,"
1317,V. THE DREAM,"They descend, gaily chattering, at the Amusement Park."
1318,V. THE DREAM,Under the trees they eat the lunch they have carried--
1319,V. THE DREAM,"Salad, sausages, sandwiches, candy, warm beer."
1320,V. THE DREAM,"They ride in the roller-coaster, two in a seat,"
1321,V. THE DREAM,"(Glorious danger! Warm, delicious proximity!)"
1322,V. THE DREAM,"The unaccustomed beer floods their veins like heady wine,"
1323,V. THE DREAM,And smothered youth awakens with shrill screams of joy.
1324,V. THE DREAM,
1325,V. THE DREAM,"The sun sets, and evening is drowned in electric lights;"
1326,V. THE DREAM,"Arm-in-arm, they wander under the trees"
1327,V. THE DREAM,"Everywhere meeting others, wandering arm-in-arm"
1328,V. THE DREAM,"In the same wistful wonder, seeking they know not what."
1329,V. THE DREAM,
1330,V. THE DREAM,"Two leave the park and the crowds--The stars shine out,"
1331,V. THE DREAM,"A river runs at their feet, behind them, a leafy copse,"
1332,V. THE DREAM,"Away on the other shore, the fields of grain"
1333,V. THE DREAM,Lie sleeping peacefully in the starlight.
1334,V. THE DREAM,"Tonight the world is theirs, a legacy"
1335,V. THE DREAM,"From those who lived familiar friends with river, field and forest--"
1336,V. THE DREAM,Their forebears.
1337,V. THE DREAM,
1338,V. THE DREAM,"Through the night, the same earth-magic moves them"
1339,V. THE DREAM,"Which swayed those ancient ones, long-dead--"
1340,V. THE DREAM,"And these, too, lean and drink,"
1341,V. THE DREAM,"Drink deeply from the river, the flowing river of life."
1342,V. THE DREAM,
1343,V. THE DREAM,"Slowly they return to the crowds and the brilliant lights,"
1344,V. THE DREAM,"Dazzled, they look aside, silently climb on the cars."
1345,V. THE DREAM,"They cling to the swaying straps, weary, inert, confused."
1346,V. THE DREAM,The lurching ear makes halt--they are thrown in each others' arms--
1347,V. THE DREAM,"Alien and unmoved, they sway apart again--"
1348,V. THE DREAM,The car moves through the fields and suburbs back to the town.
1349,V. THE DREAM,
1350,V. THE DREAM,"They leave the car in pairs, the picnic basket's"
1351,V. THE DREAM,"Rattling dismally, plate and spoon and jar."
1352,V. THE DREAM,The boy takes his girl to her lodgings in awkward silence.
1353,V. THE DREAM,
1354,V. THE DREAM,"They look askance--""Good-night!""--the front door closes,"
1355,V. THE DREAM,"Indeed their eyes have not met, since by the river"
1356,V. THE DREAM,Those wondrous moments
1357,V. THE DREAM,"Linked them to earth and night, not to each other."

1370,I,Steals through the silent trees.

1399,IV,Would whirl me down.

1401,V,V
1402,V,
1403,V,Climbing desperately toward the heights

1409,VI,
1410,VI,The mountains hold communion;
1411,VI,"They are priests, silent and austere,"

1414,VI,With unbowed heads.

1416,VII,VII
1417,VII,
1418,VII,This hidden lake

1441,VII,
1442,VII,October Afternoon
1443,VII,
1444,VII,"The air is warm and winey-sweet,"
1445,VII,Over my head the oak-leaves shine
1446,VII,"Like rich Madeira, glossy brown,"
1447,VII,"Or garnet red, like old Port wine."
1448,VII,"Wild grapes are ripening on the hill,"
1449,VII,"Dead leaves curl thickly at my feet,"
1450,VII,"Yet not one falls, it is so still."
1451,VII,"Crickets are singing in the sun,"
1452,VII,And aimlessly grasshoppers leap
1453,VII,"From discontent to discontent,"
1454,VII,Their days of leaping nearly done.
1455,VII,There's a rich quietness of earth
1456,VII,"That holds no promise any more,"
1457,VII,"And like a cup, Today is filled"
1458,VII,With the last wine the year shall pour.
1459,VII,
1460,VII,Maternity
1461,VII,

1465,VII,Of her own fertility
1466,VII,Covering scars
1467,VII,With healing green.
1468,VII,
1469,VII,"You cannot anger earth,"
1470,VII,You cannot cause her pain
1471,VII,Nor make her remember
1472,VII,"Your hungry, querulous love."
1473,VII,
1474,VII,At last your unwilling body
1475,VII,She tranquilly receives
1476,VII,And turns it to her uses.

1478,VII,The Father Speaks
1479,VII,
1480,VII,"My little son, when you were born"

1483,VII,A passionate woman--her I mourn.
1484,VII,
1485,VII,"And in her place has come another,"
1486,VII,"With troubled smile and brooding eyes,"
1487,VII,Insatiate of sacrifice
1488,VII,"And wholly, utterly your mother."
1489,VII,
1490,VII,To Allen
1491,VII,
1492,VII,"Beauty, the dream that I have dreamed so much"
1493,VII,"Comes true in your quick smile,"
1494,VII,And on your cheek I see her touch
1495,VII,And sometimes in your eyes a while
1496,VII,Immortal beauty's fleeting image lies.
1497,VII,"Dear child, in whose veins beat"
1498,VII,"The marching centuries of lovers' feet,"
1499,VII,"All those brave, ardent ghosts in you arise--"
1500,VII,"The souls who, loving beauty, gave you birth,"
1501,VII,"With a chain of passion binding beauty to earth,"
1502,VII,A captured dream--these souls breathe with your breath
1503,VII,Living again in beauty that knows no death.
1504,VII,
1505,VII,To Helen
1506,VII,
1507,VII,"Lie still in my arms, little four-years-old,"
1508,VII,Little bud that glows
1509,VII,"With more beauty and passion than it can hold,"
1510,VII,"Little flaming rose,"
1511,VII,
1512,VII,"The spring's red blossoms, when winter lies deep"
1513,VII,On a wind-swept world
1514,VII,"Of tossing branches, lie safely asleep"
1515,VII,In brown buds curled.
1516,VII,
1517,VII,They wake--and the wind strips their petals away
1518,VII,And spills them afar--
1519,VII,"Can I keep you from blooming, whatever I say,"
1520,VII,Wild bud that you are!
1521,VII,
1522,VII,The Immortal
1523,VII,
1524,VII,"Child of a love denied, a dream unborn,"
1525,VII,Spirit more brave
1526,VII,"Than passion's unfulfilment, wiser than fate--"
1527,VII,Nor breast nor grave
1528,VII,"As cradle you have known,--"
1529,VII,I mourn
1530,VII,That my soul knows its own
1531,VII,Too late!
1532,VII,
1533,VII,"A soul's half-breath,"
1534,VII,"Passion's unremembered dream,"
1535,VII,"Perfume without a vase,"
1536,VII,Intangible you seem
1537,VII,To life or death.
1538,VII,
1539,VII,And when the coloured mantle of the days
1540,VII,"Slips from my shoulders, and I lie"
1541,VII,"Forgetful, dumb,"
1542,VII,"Mingled with earth in passionless embrace,"
1543,VII,"Will you, forgotten as a bird,"
1544,VII,Singing unheard
1545,VII,"In space,"
1546,VII,Will you not come
1547,VII,"When every other dream is gone,"
1548,VII,Bringing to that silent place
1549,VII,The shadow of a gesture flung
1550,VII,"By motionless hands, a floating echo hung"
1551,VII,"From an unspoken word,"
1552,VII,And to the empty sky
1553,VII,The sunset of a day which did not dawn
1554,VII,And cannot die!

1558,I,I
1559,I,
1560,I,At first in dreams
1561,I,I pressed you so close
1562,I,"That you melted away on my breast,"
1563,I,"But now I wait, breathless and motionless,"
1564,I,Till I feel your slender arms caress me
1565,I,Like swallows blown against me
1566,I,And quickly flown.
1567,I,
1568,II,II
1569,II,
1570,II,"Small flower,"
1571,II,"My body is the earth from which you sprang,"

1617,I,The warm winds touch the bands
1618,I,That hold her hair.
1619,I,"The call of a silver horn floats by,"
1620,I,A lover tosses flowers into her hands.
1621,I,
1622,I,Maura dreams unwakened--
1623,I,"She joins the maidens in their dance,"
1624,I,"Her limbs follow slow rhythms,"
1625,I,"A lover leads her into the shade,"
1626,I,She moves as in a trance.

1630,II,What dim confusion
1631,II,"Troubles her dream,"
1632,II,What passionate caress
1633,II,Disturbs her spirit's rapt seclusion?
1634,II,
1635,II,Earth draws her close. How warm
1636,II,Is lover-earth! Like a sleeping bird
1637,II,"She gives herself, then suddenly"
1638,II,She is a leaf whirled in the storm.
1639,II,
1640,II,"Somewhere in a quiet room, her soul unstirred,"
1641,II,"Dead... or sleeping,"
1642,II,Through the blind tumult hears afar
1643,II,"The note of a horn, like a silver thread."
1644,II,She has given her soul to an echo's keeping.
1645,II,

1648,III,Who knows the mountain where the hunter rides
1649,III,Winding his horn?

1651,III,"Wakens forlorn,"
1652,III,Too late to catch the tenuous thread
1653,III,Of silver sound
1654,III,"Which in the troubled, intricate fugue of earth"
1655,III,Is drowned.

1662,IV,"A shining pool, where lingers"
1663,IV,"The colour of an unseen golden sky,"
1664,IV,A pool where echoes fall asleep.
1665,IV,
1666,IV,But restless fingers
1667,IV,"Trouble the waters cool,"
1668,IV,"Snatch at reflected beauty, and destroy"

1694,VI,Earth's arms are wide to her. What breast
1695,VI,Offers such gentle sleeping?
1696,VI,Her limbs lie peacefully.
1697,VI,
1698,VI,From the dark West
1699,VI,There comes a note like the echoing cry
1700,VI,Of one who rides through the dusk alone
1701,VI,After the hunt sweeps by.
1702,VI,
1703,VI,It fades--the night wind is forlorn--
1704,VI,"Music is still,"

1726,VI,"Whose deep roots, alive and sound"
1727,VI,Blindly reach
1728,VI,Mingling in the fertile ground
1729,VI,Each with each--
