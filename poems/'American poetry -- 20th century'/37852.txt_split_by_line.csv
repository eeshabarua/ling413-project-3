1660,TO A CHILD,
1661,TO A CHILD,Still young enough to be a part
1662,TO A CHILD,"Of Nature's great impulsive heart,"

1665,TO A CHILD,
1666,TO A CHILD,And yet with lovely reason skilled
1667,TO A CHILD,Each day new paradise to build;
1668,TO A CHILD,"Elate explorer of each sense,"
1669,TO A CHILD,"Without dismay, without pretence!"
1670,TO A CHILD,
1671,TO A CHILD,In your unstained transparent eyes
1672,TO A CHILD,"There is no conscience, no surprise:"
1673,TO A CHILD,"Life's queer conundrums you accept,"
1674,TO A CHILD,Your strange divinity still kept.
1675,TO A CHILD,
1676,TO A CHILD,"Being, that now absorbs you, all"
1677,TO A CHILD,"Harmonious, unit, integral,"
1678,TO A CHILD,"Will shred into perplexing bits,--"

1680,TO A CHILD,
1681,TO A CHILD,"And Life, that sets all things in rhyme,"

1704,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"That stoves are hot, and how to brush your hair;"
1705,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"And so, my poor, undaunted little stripling,"
1706,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"By bruises, tears, and trousers you will grow,"
1707,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"And, borrowing a leaf from Mr. Kipling,"
1708,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"I'll wish you luck, and moralize you so:"
1709,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,
1710,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,If you can think up seven thousand methods
1711,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,Of giving cooks and parents heart disease;
1712,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"Can rifle pantry-shelves, and then give death odds"
1713,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"By water, fire, and falling out of trees;"
1714,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,If you can fill your every boyish minute
1715,TO A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN,"With sixty seconds' worth of mischief done,"

3375,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,In the style appropriate to

3377,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,
3378,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,"Well, if I can't then no one can--"

3380,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,She'll never know another man
3381,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,So fit for her to be a friend to.
3382,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,
3383,LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,"Not love me, eh? She better had!"

3925,A PRINTER'S MADRIGAL,"I've never seen, in all my life,"
3926,A PRINTER'S MADRIGAL,So fine a specimen of printing.
3927,A PRINTER'S MADRIGAL,
3928,A PRINTER'S MADRIGAL,"Her type is not some =bold-face= font,"

3948,A PRINTER'S MADRIGAL,"Her nose, _italicized brevier_,"
3949,A PRINTER'S MADRIGAL,Too lovely to describe by penpoint;

4071,THE MADONNA OF THE CURB,The pitiless summer comes.
4072,THE MADONNA OF THE CURB,The wail of sickly children
4073,THE MADONNA OF THE CURB,She knows; she understands

4090,THE MADONNA OF THE CURB,The blessing of being clean.
4091,THE MADONNA OF THE CURB,And when you are giving millions
