1472,A TEST OF LOVE.,Alice loved Ed; when children it was seen
1473,A TEST OF LOVE.,That Ed loved her and held her as his queen.
1474,A TEST OF LOVE.,Together they were always seen at play.

1479,A TEST OF LOVE.,Ed quickly brought and placed it at her hand.
1480,A TEST OF LOVE.,In all their play they were not seen to pout;
1481,A TEST OF LOVE.,Always in love there was no falling out.
1482,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Each day to school they hand in hand would go,"
1483,A TEST OF LOVE.,Her books and slate Ed carried to and fro;
1484,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Each Sunday morn the chapel bell would chime,"
1485,A TEST OF LOVE.,And Ed with Alice marched away on time;
1486,A TEST OF LOVE.,"To church at night Alice alone he’d bring,"
1487,A TEST OF LOVE.,And from one book both in the choir would sing.
1488,A TEST OF LOVE.,The childish love that bound them when at play
1489,A TEST OF LOVE.,To greater love soon yielded up its sway.
1490,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Were children once, but ah, no children now;"
1491,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Ed was a farmer, master of the plow;"

1507,A TEST OF LOVE.,To win her love he sought with all his might.
1508,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Soon she loved John and soon he loved the maid,"
1509,A TEST OF LOVE.,So swift is love when gold can give it aid.
1510,A TEST OF LOVE.,And since that day the youth came from the north
1511,A TEST OF LOVE.,Ed’s cloak of love had keenly felt a moth.
1512,A TEST OF LOVE.,E’er on his face there dwelt a heavy frown;
1513,A TEST OF LOVE.,Each day he passed his head was hanging down.
1514,A TEST OF LOVE.,And all the village wondered as he passed
1515,A TEST OF LOVE.,"What made the change, what made him so downcast."
1516,A TEST OF LOVE.,Each Sunday morn he strolled alone to church;
1517,A TEST OF LOVE.,We sympathized--we knew it grieved him much;
1518,A TEST OF LOVE.,As when the ivy from the oak we tear.
1519,A TEST OF LOVE.,"It seemeth lonely, ah! it seemeth bare."
1520,A TEST OF LOVE.,"So ’twas with Ed when they were seen apart,"
1521,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He seemed e’er sad, so withered was his heart."
1522,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He loved her still, and each time he would call"
1523,A TEST OF LOVE.,He plead in vain that she would love him all.
1524,A TEST OF LOVE.,Each night Ed called each night both lovers met;
1525,A TEST OF LOVE.,They’d try in vain each other to outset.
1526,A TEST OF LOVE.,When on her face Ed read her heart’s desire
1527,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He’d ask his hat, reluctantly retire."
1528,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Poor Ed, from youth could see her any time,"
1529,A TEST OF LOVE.,Now once a week his visits were confined.
1530,A TEST OF LOVE.,Each youth desired the maid to be his bride;
1531,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She loved them both, and how could she decide."
1532,A TEST OF LOVE.,Three months had passed--the choice she had not made;
1533,A TEST OF LOVE.,With bashful face she sought her mother’s aid.
1534,A TEST OF LOVE.,She hinted out the burden of her heart;
1535,A TEST OF LOVE.,Her loving mother knew the other part.
1536,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“Oh, Ed and John,” she said, with trembling voice,"
1537,A TEST OF LOVE.,“I love them both and cannot make a choice;
1538,A TEST OF LOVE.,Three months in vain the choice I’ve tried to make;
1539,A TEST OF LOVE.,"It’s left with you mother, which one to take.”"
1540,A TEST OF LOVE.,The mother thought awhile and slowly said:
1541,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“I cannot choose the man for you to wed,"
1542,A TEST OF LOVE.,For much is in the saying of the bard:
1543,A TEST OF LOVE.,’Make your own bed and keep it if it’s hard;’
1544,A TEST OF LOVE.,So make your choice; if he’s not what he seems
1545,A TEST OF LOVE.,On no one else can you well place the blame.
1546,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Since I’m your ma, advice ’tis mine to give:"
1547,A TEST OF LOVE.,"With whom you choose through life pray try to live,"
1548,A TEST OF LOVE.,For they who wed and quit without a cause
1549,A TEST OF LOVE.,Have broken o’er our Holy Father’s laws.
1550,A TEST OF LOVE.,Unless you can for him lay down your life
1551,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Never, my child, consent to be his wife,"
1552,A TEST OF LOVE.,"For married life is greater than a dream,"
1553,A TEST OF LOVE.,And all have found it greater than it seemed.
1554,A TEST OF LOVE.,"To know the one whose love is pure and best,"
1555,A TEST OF LOVE.,I think it right to bring him to a test.
1556,A TEST OF LOVE.,How can you judge from the word the greater love?
1557,A TEST OF LOVE.,Does rain tell all that it has seen above?
1558,A TEST OF LOVE.,What steed an empty wagon cannot pull?
1559,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Ah, place him to a wagon that is full."
1560,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The many words! but, ah, the simple few,"
1561,A TEST OF LOVE.,Can have a great effect if spoken true.
1562,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The sweetest words make not the greatest youth,"
1563,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Ah, he is great who sayest but the truth."
1564,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The world to-day is so enrapt with sin,"
1565,A TEST OF LOVE.,"That it is right with women and with men,"
1566,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Before they be exalted in our sight,"
1567,A TEST OF LOVE.,We must have great assurance they are right.
1568,A TEST OF LOVE.,"So Ed and John seem good, I love them well;"
1569,A TEST OF LOVE.,The one for you to choose I cannot tell.
1570,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The way to find the one to suit you best,"
1571,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Put life at stake and give them both a test,"
1572,A TEST OF LOVE.,For he who takes a maiden for his wife
1573,A TEST OF LOVE.,Should count it joy to give for her his life.”
1574,A TEST OF LOVE.,She knew that neither Ed nor John could swim;
1575,A TEST OF LOVE.,To try the deep would be a test for them.
1576,A TEST OF LOVE.,She thought how each of them enjoyed to row.
1577,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She said: “Some day, while rowing, drop your oar,"
1578,A TEST OF LOVE.,And tell him bring the oar you’ll be his bride;
1579,A TEST OF LOVE.,First let the oar ’neath the boat be tied;
1580,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Engage them now, go quick and tie the oar.”"
1581,A TEST OF LOVE.,"One came at three, the other came at four."
1582,A TEST OF LOVE.,I feign to tell them what the mother said;
1583,A TEST OF LOVE.,So great the plot when by a woman made.
1584,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She set the time, and John and Ed complied;"
1585,A TEST OF LOVE.,The evening came and John was by her side.
1586,A TEST OF LOVE.,"With John she goes, as though she loved him best,"
1587,A TEST OF LOVE.,Out in the boat that she his love might test.
1588,A TEST OF LOVE.,From youth she knew the art to dive and swim;
1589,A TEST OF LOVE.,"’Twas all a secret, ’t was not known to him."
1590,A TEST OF LOVE.,They reached the deep where angry billows roar;
1591,A TEST OF LOVE.,She for a purpose dropped her only oar.
1592,A TEST OF LOVE.,Out from the boat the oar the waves did toss;
1593,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The maid screamed out in anguish, “We are lost!”"
1594,A TEST OF LOVE.,The oar was fairly whirling by a wave;
1595,A TEST OF LOVE.,The frightened maid knelt praying God to save.
1596,A TEST OF LOVE.,The coward youth sat trembling pale as death;
1597,A TEST OF LOVE.,"His face had changed, it seemed he had no breath."
1598,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The maid knelt still, pretending loud to weep."
1599,A TEST OF LOVE.,But through her fingers at the youth she’d peep.
1600,A TEST OF LOVE.,She saw the youth still fainting in dismay;
1601,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She would have laughed, but thought she would betray."
1602,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She raised her head, the oar again she spied;"
1603,A TEST OF LOVE.,Beneath the boat the oar with cord was tied.
1604,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She really cried, for lo! her face was red,"
1605,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“John, bring the oar, I’ll be your wife,” she said."
1606,A TEST OF LOVE.,"But John sat still, for he could not obey;"
1607,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“I cannot swim,” was all she heard him say."
1608,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She bade him think, she bade him count the cost;"
1609,A TEST OF LOVE.,“Without the oar won’t both our lives be lost?
1610,A TEST OF LOVE.,If you sit here is death not sure?” she said.
1611,A TEST OF LOVE.,"John knew it was, and cowardly dropped his head."
1612,A TEST OF LOVE.,"With trembling voice she cried, imploring still:"
1613,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“Go, bring the oar; if you won’t, John, I will."
1614,A TEST OF LOVE.,What will you do?” She paused to give him time.
1615,A TEST OF LOVE.,He would not go; she leaped into the brine;
1616,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She sank and rose, and loudly came a sound:"
1617,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“Pray come and help! quick! love, for soon I drown!”"
1618,A TEST OF LOVE.,John saw his love the third time disappear;
1619,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She cried in vain, for John refused to steer."
1620,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Again she rose and quickly seized the oar,"
1621,A TEST OF LOVE.,Towards the boat the oar she swiftly bore.
1622,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Soon in the boat, dripping, she took her seat,"
1623,A TEST OF LOVE.,As John sat cowardly gazing at her feet;
1624,A TEST OF LOVE.,Then to the shore she quickly made her way;
1625,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She reached the shore, to him was heard to say:"
1626,A TEST OF LOVE.,“The oar wasn’t lost; by this thread it was tied;
1627,A TEST OF LOVE.,My life to you I’m thinking to confide.”
1628,A TEST OF LOVE.,And this she said: “I did it just to prove
1629,A TEST OF LOVE.,Whether or not you’re worthy of my love.”
1630,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She told him all, and said: “John can’t you see"
1631,A TEST OF LOVE.,That you are false and do not care for me.”
1632,A TEST OF LOVE.,"And John stood crying, begging not to tell;"
1633,A TEST OF LOVE.,"She vowed she’d not, and said to him farewell."
1634,A TEST OF LOVE.,He went his way and she sat on the beach--
1635,A TEST OF LOVE.,I’ll tell you why before the end is reached--
1636,A TEST OF LOVE.,"’Twas nearly four, and Ed, her other beau,"
1637,A TEST OF LOVE.,Had promised then to meet her for a row.
1638,A TEST OF LOVE.,"The hour had come, the village clock was heard;"
1639,A TEST OF LOVE.,Ah! Ed was there; he always kept his word.
1640,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Up from the beach she rose, her friend to greet;"
1641,A TEST OF LOVE.,She had not heard the tramping of his feet.
1642,A TEST OF LOVE.,Soon in the boat they both sat face to face;
1643,A TEST OF LOVE.,She took the oar as though out for a race;
1644,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Then with the oar she gave the sea a sweep,"
1645,A TEST OF LOVE.,And soon the boat was sailing on the deep;
1646,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“Here comes a ship; look, Ed, I see the top.”"
1647,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He turned his head, the oar she did let drop."
1648,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“Dear Ed,” she cried, “pray take me to my home;"
1649,A TEST OF LOVE.,I dropped the oar and death is sure our doom.”
1650,A TEST OF LOVE.,He gazed at her and saw her faint away.
1651,A TEST OF LOVE.,"“Don’t cry, my dear,” she softly heard him say;"
1652,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He raised her head, consoling words he speaks,"
1653,A TEST OF LOVE.,Brushed back her hair and kissed her rosy cheeks;
1654,A TEST OF LOVE.,Pretended she unconscious of a kiss;
1655,A TEST OF LOVE.,Yet still her soul was thrilled with holy bliss.
1656,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He raised her gently in a fond embrace,"
1657,A TEST OF LOVE.,"And gently wipes her tear-stained, blushing face,"
1658,A TEST OF LOVE.,The tears upon her rosy cheek repose
1659,A TEST OF LOVE.,Appeared like sparkling dewdrops on a rose.
1660,A TEST OF LOVE.,"As men in hurrying pressed for want of time,"
1661,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Can find a moment still to sip the wine,"
1662,A TEST OF LOVE.,"So hurried Ed, for fear the oar he’d miss,"
1663,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Yet still found time, yea, thrice, her lips to kiss;"
1664,A TEST OF LOVE.,Just as a man is moved by sparkling drinks
1665,A TEST OF LOVE.,Performs an act before of danger thinks.
1666,A TEST OF LOVE.,The kiss affected Ed as strongest wine;
1667,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He could not swim, yet did not fear the brine;"
1668,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He did not stop for once to count the cost,"
1669,A TEST OF LOVE.,Nor thought he once that either would be lost.
1670,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He said, unless his queen should reach the shore,"
1671,A TEST OF LOVE.,Out of his arm he would have made an oar;
1672,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Then from the boat he leaped, and could not swim;"
1673,A TEST OF LOVE.,An angry wave came quick and covered him.
1674,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Strangled he rose, though struggling for his life,"
1675,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He cried aloud: “O, God, pray, save my wife!”"
1676,A TEST OF LOVE.,"He did not drown, for she well knew the art,"
1677,A TEST OF LOVE.,And leaped and bore him speechless to her heart.
1678,A TEST OF LOVE.,Hold of the cord the oar she quickly drew;
1679,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Yet, brought the oar she said he never knew;"
1680,A TEST OF LOVE.,He really thought he saved his lover’s life.
1681,A TEST OF LOVE.,He woke and cried aloud: “You are my wife.”
1682,A TEST OF LOVE.,For when he sank he was a senseless elf;
1683,A TEST OF LOVE.,To-day he thinks he brought the oar himself.
1684,A TEST OF LOVE.,And when she saw how artless was his love
1685,A TEST OF LOVE.,The love within her heart was felt to move;
1686,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Where there is love much love it doth inspire,"
1687,A TEST OF LOVE.,Thus blazed her love and set his soul on fire.
1688,A TEST OF LOVE.,"It seemed as love her heart would ’sunder rent,"
1689,A TEST OF LOVE.,Unless by hasty means could give it vent;
1690,A TEST OF LOVE.,For when love’s heart is free from doubt and fear
1691,A TEST OF LOVE.,It sayeth much that love would feign to hear.
1692,A TEST OF LOVE.,Thus went the time until the glowing west
1693,A TEST OF LOVE.,Was telling that the sun had gone to rest.
1694,A TEST OF LOVE.,"They reached the shore, though he was soaking wet,"
1695,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Before they left, the wedding day was set."
1696,A TEST OF LOVE.,"Three weeks passed on, the blessed eve drew near,"
1697,A TEST OF LOVE.,The wedding bells were chiming loud and clear.
1698,A TEST OF LOVE.,That night they vowed to love and serve through life;
1699,A TEST OF LOVE.,There never lived a happier man and wife.
1700,A TEST OF LOVE.,In Mistle still to-day there can be seen
1701,A TEST OF LOVE.,"A thatch-roofed house, twined round with ivy green;"
1702,A TEST OF LOVE.,Upon the lawn a boy and girl at play--
1703,A TEST OF LOVE.,This is the home where Ed and Alice stay.
