291,HOMO ELASTICUS,a glutinous secretion in the cells

293,HOMO ELASTICUS,
294,HOMO ELASTICUS,"Milky, it clings to the gums"
295,HOMO ELASTICUS,with a stickiness that fastens on the tongue
296,HOMO ELASTICUS,"to be dumb,"
297,HOMO ELASTICUS,or else stretches and winds a band
298,HOMO ELASTICUS,"around the heart so tight, it has to snap"

449,I WOULD REMEMBER,
450,I WOULD REMEMBER,and I have stood still above the bend
451,I WOULD REMEMBER,"that separates the foot from distant hulls,"
452,I WOULD REMEMBER,to fill my eyes with flying sails' wings spread.
453,I WOULD REMEMBER,
454,I WOULD REMEMBER,I have watched them many times repair
455,I WOULD REMEMBER,the far shore's curve around the sun
456,I WOULD REMEMBER,and hold it there ensnared
457,I WOULD REMEMBER,
458,I WOULD REMEMBER,"until provoked they drop midair,"
459,I WOULD REMEMBER,instinct with seaward gravitation
460,I WOULD REMEMBER,and angry claws declared--
461,I WOULD REMEMBER,
462,I WOULD REMEMBER,their mutiny a gold crazed rout

474,AFTER THE STORM,
475,AFTER THE STORM,"That morning, after the storm,"
476,AFTER THE STORM,everyone gathered about the tree
477,AFTER THE STORM,and marveled at its fall:
478,AFTER THE STORM,"the body leaning gently on one arm,"
479,AFTER THE STORM,its mighty head now cushioned by deep
480,AFTER THE STORM,"branches, seemingly asleep."
481,AFTER THE STORM,
482,AFTER THE STORM,"""You wouldn't think a storm,"" one said,"
483,AFTER THE STORM,"then broke off, staring at the fruit"
484,AFTER THE STORM,that never would be eaten red
485,AFTER THE STORM,"and sweetened by the sun, or set"
486,AFTER THE STORM,"in jars and slowly left to cool,"
487,AFTER THE STORM,"the ripening years ahead gone, too."
488,AFTER THE STORM,
489,AFTER THE STORM,"""It was the wind.""  ""The rain.""  Each spoke"
490,AFTER THE STORM,a part of truth out of his own mouth
491,AFTER THE STORM,with words that could not make it whole
492,AFTER THE STORM,because the naked roots showed
493,AFTER THE STORM,"how much there was to doubt,"
494,AFTER THE STORM,the secret in the darkness crying loud.
495,AFTER THE STORM,
496,AFTER THE STORM,"Even a tree, she thought, biting her tongue"
497,AFTER THE STORM,"and bringing her childish thoughts down,"
498,AFTER THE STORM,"remembering the climbs, the stout swing hung"
499,AFTER THE STORM,"on rafters soaring to the sun,"
500,AFTER THE STORM,a tree built like a tower
501,AFTER THE STORM,so you could visit God and talk for hours.
502,AFTER THE STORM,
503,AFTER THE STORM,The men sawed logs and timber all that day
504,AFTER THE STORM,"until there was nothing left, not"
505,AFTER THE STORM,even a shadow where you could wait
506,AFTER THE STORM,"and hide to see if it would wake,"
507,AFTER THE STORM,then they buried the hole and forgot
508,AFTER THE STORM,what else they might have covered with the sod.
509,AFTER THE STORM,
510,AFTER THE STORM,"Dead trees tell no tales, she thought,"
511,AFTER THE STORM,"nor empty nests, nor little girls who see"
512,AFTER THE STORM,how helpless all things are when caught
513,AFTER THE STORM,"by storm, no matter how big or"
514,AFTER THE STORM,"strong or secure, and she walked quietly"
515,AFTER THE STORM,into the house to help with the next meal.

521,THE CAGE,
522,THE CAGE,Thoughts like an empty cage
523,THE CAGE,receive the morning
524,THE CAGE,through the windowpane
525,THE CAGE,and quietly swing.
526,THE CAGE,
527,THE CAGE,No flutter brings my eye
528,THE CAGE,to a meaninged core
529,THE CAGE,"for the waking light,"
530,THE CAGE,the door transparent.
531,THE CAGE,
532,THE CAGE,Held blind by the mirror
533,THE CAGE,"and deaf by the bell,"
534,THE CAGE,I must search my mind
535,THE CAGE,"by taste, smell, and touch."
536,THE CAGE,
537,THE CAGE,Bars silhouette a wall
538,THE CAGE,to enclose the noon
539,THE CAGE,where images halt
540,THE CAGE,and the night soon comes.

2074,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2075,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,I have not always been blind.
2076,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,My eyes opened to the sun
2077,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"like any child's, and I ran"
2078,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,and played in my waking hours
2079,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,like schoolboys everywhere.  Night
2080,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,was my sleep and the dark powers
2081,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,I knew from childhood on.
2082,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2083,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,I do not speak of the mind's;
2084,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"the others came later, when"
2085,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,natural fears gave way to man's
2086,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"and I saw darker things still,"
2087,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,things beyond the wildest flight
2088,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,of a boy's fancies.  Who will
2089,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,deny there are worse dragons?
2090,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2091,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,But I did not see the sign
2092,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,of what was to come until
2093,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,I was blind as Samson.  With
2094,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"one stroke, I lost all desire,"
2095,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"hope, strength--for who needs his sight"
2096,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,when cold age pokes the heart's fire
2097,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,with only a broken stick?
2098,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2099,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,Now at my feet a dog whines
2100,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,even in slumber; he sniffs
2101,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,another's bone as he shifts
2102,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"in his own darkness, hungry"
2103,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"for gain that requires no fight,"
2104,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,and in his dreams grows angry
2105,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,at dream's inconsequent wish.
2106,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2107,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"How can I reproach him, I"
2108,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"who am shepherd and watchman,"
2109,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,and as ignorant and dumb?
2110,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,Both of us strain at a gnat
2111,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"and swallow camels, the spite"
2112,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,of those who may look at
2113,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,but not touch the other's ration.
2114,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2115,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,Yet I make no mourn or cry
2116,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,I have no tears to defend.
2117,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,By now my shoes understand
2118,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"how to find the door, the latch"
2119,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,and go without any fright
2120,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,of stumbling up crooked paths
2121,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,since all paths lead to the one.
2122,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2123,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"Yes, yes, the words of the wise,"
2124,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,but I do not eat their bread
2125,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,or cover my lips to swear
2126,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"by the debts of the guilty,"
2127,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,for I can not see the light
2128,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,that moves men to take pity
2129,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,and neither can I forget.
2130,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2131,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"When harvest is past, the ties"
2132,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,with summer are ended.
2133,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,Even the flies know better
2134,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,than to sit at a table
2135,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,where vinegar and gall blight
2136,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"the sense--their comfort, the chill"
2137,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,presaging winter's opiate.
2138,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2139,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"I ask, who can see God's eye?"
2140,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,Then let him be sure to scour
2141,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"both inside his cup and out,"
2142,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,for though the temple is lit
2143,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"like gold and the altar white,"
2144,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,the heart of the hypocrite
2145,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,shall betray his hands and mouth.
2146,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,
2147,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"I sleep the sleep of death, ai!"
2148,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"An old man, I have no rod,"
2149,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"no plague to command, no cloud"
2150,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,to conceal my nakedness--
2151,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,nothing but a toothless bite
2152,WHEN YESTERDAY COMES,"as I wander in silence,"
