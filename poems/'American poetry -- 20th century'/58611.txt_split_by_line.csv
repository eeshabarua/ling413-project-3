119,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
120,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
121,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I met a lady from the South who said
122,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"(You won't believe she said it, but she said it):"
123,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""None of my family ever worked, or had"
124,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"A thing to sell."" I don't suppose the work"
125,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Much matters. You may work for all of me.
126,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I've seen the time I've had to work myself.
127,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The having anything to sell[1] is what
128,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Is the disgrace in man or state or nation.
129,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
130,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I met a traveller from Arkansas
131,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Who boasted of his state as beautiful
132,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"For diamonds and apples. ""Diamonds"
133,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And apples in commercial quantities?"""
134,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"I asked him, on my guard. ""Oh yes,"" he answered,"
135,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman.
136,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""I see the porter's made your bed,"" I told him."
137,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
138,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I met a Californian who would
139,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Talk California--a state so blessed,"
140,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"He said, in climate none had ever died there"
141,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"A natural death, and Vigilance Committees"
142,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Had had to organize to stock the graveyards
143,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And vindicate the state's humanity.
144,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Just the way Steffanson runs on,"" I murmured,"
145,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""About the British Arctic. That's what comes"
146,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Of being in the market with a climate."""
147,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
148,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"I met a poet from another state,"
149,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"A zealot full of fluid inspiration,"
150,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Who in the name of fluid inspiration,"
151,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"But in the best style of bad salesmanship,"
152,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Angrily tried to make me write a protest
153,NEW HAMPSHIRE,(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act.
154,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He didn't even offer me a drink
155,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Until I asked for one to steady _him_.
156,NEW HAMPSHIRE,This is called having an idea to sell.
157,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
158,NEW HAMPSHIRE,It never could have happened in New Hampshire.
159,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
160,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The only person really soiled with trade
161,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire
162,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Was someone who had just come back ashamed
163,NEW HAMPSHIRE,From selling things in California.
164,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He'd built a noble mansard roof with balls
165,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"On turrets like Constantinople, deep"
166,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"In woods some ten miles from a railroad station,"
167,NEW HAMPSHIRE,As if to put forever out of mind
168,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The hope of being, as we say, received."
169,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I found him standing at the close of day
170,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Inside the threshold of his open barn,"
171,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage--
172,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And recognized him through the iron grey
173,NEW HAMPSHIRE,In which his face was muffled to the eyes
174,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed"
175,NEW HAMPSHIRE,A drover with me on the road to Brighton.
176,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"His farm was ""grounds,"" and not a farm at all;"
177,NEW HAMPSHIRE,His house among the local sheds and shanties
178,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Rose like a factor's at a trading station.
179,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And he was rich, and I was still a rascal."
180,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"I couldn't keep from asking impolitely,"
181,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Where had he been and what had he been doing?
182,NEW HAMPSHIRE,How did he get so? (Rich was understood.)
183,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"In dealing in ""old rags"" in San Francisco."
184,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Oh it was terrible as well could be.
185,NEW HAMPSHIRE,We both of us turned over in our graves.
186,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
187,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Just specimens is all New Hampshire has,"
188,NEW HAMPSHIRE,One each of everything as in a show-case
189,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Which naturally she doesn't care to sell.
190,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
191,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"She had one President (pronounce him Purse,"
192,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And make the most of it for better or worse.
193,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He's your one chance to score against the state).
194,NEW HAMPSHIRE,She had one Daniel Webster. He was all
195,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be.
196,NEW HAMPSHIRE,She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him.
197,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
198,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I call her old. She has one family
199,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Whose claim is good to being settled here
200,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Before the era of colonization,"
201,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And before that of exploration even.
202,NEW HAMPSHIRE,John Smith remarked them as he coasted by
203,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf
204,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself"
205,NEW HAMPSHIRE,They weren't Red Indians but veritable
206,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people,"
207,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Like those who furnished Adam's sons with wives;
208,NEW HAMPSHIRE,However uninnocent they may have been
209,NEW HAMPSHIRE,In being there so early in our history.
210,NEW HAMPSHIRE,They'd been there then a hundred years or more.
211,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Pity he didn't ask what they were up to
212,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"At that date with a wharf already built,"
213,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And take their name. They've since told me their name--
214,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Today an honored one in Nottingham.
215,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
216,NEW HAMPSHIRE,As for what they were up to more than fishing--
217,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Suppose they weren't behaving Puritanly,"
218,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The hour had not yet struck for being good,"
219,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical.
220,NEW HAMPSHIRE,It became an explorer of the deep
221,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Not to explore too deep in others' business.
222,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
223,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Did you but know of him, New Hampshire has"
224,NEW HAMPSHIRE,One real reformer who would change the world
225,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"So it would be accepted by two classes,"
226,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Artists the minute they set up as artists,"
227,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Before, that is, they are themselves accepted,"
228,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And boys the minute they get out of college.
229,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I can't help thinking those are tests to go by.
230,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
231,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And she has one I don't know what to call him,"
232,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Who comes from Philadelphia every year
233,NEW HAMPSHIRE,With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds
234,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He wants to give the educational
235,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Advantages of growing almost wild
236,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle--
237,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Dorkings because they're spoken of by Chaucer,"
238,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Sussex because they're spoken of by Herrick.
239,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
240,NEW HAMPSHIRE,She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold--[2]
241,NEW HAMPSHIRE,You may have heard of it. I had a farm
242,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Offered me not long since up Berlin way
243,NEW HAMPSHIRE,With a mine on it that was worked for gold;
244,NEW HAMPSHIRE,But not gold in commercial quantities.
245,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Just enough gold to make the engagement rings
246,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And marriage rings of those who owned the farm.
247,NEW HAMPSHIRE,What gold more innocent could one have asked for?
248,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
249,NEW HAMPSHIRE,One of my children ranging after rocks
250,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan
251,NEW HAMPSHIRE,A specimen of beryl with a trace
252,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Of radium. I know with radium
253,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The trace would have to be the merest trace
254,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"To be below the threshold of commercial,"
255,NEW HAMPSHIRE,But trust New Hampshire not to have enough
256,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Of radium or anything to sell.
257,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
258,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"A specimen of everything, I said."
259,NEW HAMPSHIRE,She has one witch--old style.[3] She lives in Colebrook.
260,NEW HAMPSHIRE,(The only other witch I ever met
261,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston.
262,NEW HAMPSHIRE,There were four candles and four people present.
263,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The witch was young, and beautiful (new style),"
264,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And open-minded. She was free to question
265,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes.
266,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Why was it so much greater when the boxes
267,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Were metal than it was when they were wooden?
268,NEW HAMPSHIRE,It made the world seem so mysterious.
269,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The S'ciety for Psychical Research
270,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions.
271,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.)
272,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
273,NEW HAMPSHIRE,New Hampshire _used_ to have at Salem
274,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"A company we called the White Corpuscles,"
275,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Whose duty was at any hour of night
276,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To rush in sheets and fool's caps where they smelled
277,NEW HAMPSHIRE,A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented
278,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And give someone the Skipper Ireson's Ride.
279,NEW HAMPSHIRE,One each of everything as in a show-case.
280,NEW HAMPSHIRE,More than enough land for a specimen
281,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"You'll say she has, but there there enters in"
282,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Something else to protect her from herself.
283,NEW HAMPSHIRE,There quality[4] makes up for quantity.
284,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.
285,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The farm I made my home on in the mountains
286,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I had to take by force rather than buy.
287,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I caught the owner outdoors by himself
288,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Raking up after winter, and I said,"
289,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""I'm going to put you off this farm: I want it."""
290,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Where are you going to put me? In the road?"""
291,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""I'm going to put you on the farm next to it."""
292,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Why won't the farm next to it do for you?"""
293,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""I like this better."" It was really better."
294,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
295,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed,"
296,NEW HAMPSHIRE,With no suspicion in stem-end or blossom-end
297,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Of vitriol or arsenate of lead,"
298,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And so not good for anything but cider.
299,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats
300,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Far up the birches out of reach of man.[5]
301,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
302,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"A state producing precious metals, stones,"
303,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And--writing; none of these except perhaps
304,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The precious literature in quantity
305,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Or quality to worry the producer
306,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"About disposing of it. Do you know,"
307,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Considering the market, there are more"
308,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Poems produced than any other thing?[6]
309,NEW HAMPSHIRE,No wonder poets sometimes have to _seem_
310,NEW HAMPSHIRE,So much more business-like than business men.
311,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Their wares are so much harder to get rid of.
312,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
313,NEW HAMPSHIRE,She's one of the two best states in the Union.
314,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Vermont's the other. And the two have been
315,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Yoke-fellows in the sap-yoke from of old
316,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"In many Marches.[7] And they lie like wedges,"
317,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end,"
318,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And are a figure of the way the strong
319,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Of mind and strong of arm should fit together,"
320,NEW HAMPSHIRE,One thick where one is thin and vice versa.
321,NEW HAMPSHIRE,New Hampshire raises the Connecticut
322,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"In a trout hatchery near Canada,"
323,NEW HAMPSHIRE,But soon divides the river with Vermont.
324,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Both are delightful states for their absurdly
325,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Small towns--Lost Nation, Bungey, Muddy Boo,"
326,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Poplin, Still Corners (so called not because"
327,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The place is silent all day long, nor yet"
328,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Because it boasts a whisky still--because
329,NEW HAMPSHIRE,It set out once to be a city and still
330,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Is only corners, cross-roads in a wood)."
331,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And I remember one whose name appeared
332,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Between the pictures on a movie screen
333,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Election[8] night once in Franconia,"
334,NEW HAMPSHIRE,When everything had gone Republican
335,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And Democrats were sore in need of comfort:
336,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4"
337,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest
338,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Laughed the loud laugh, the big laugh at the little."
339,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"New York (five million) laughs at Manchester,"
340,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs
341,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton"
342,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and"
343,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Franconia laughs, I fear,--did laugh that night--"
344,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at,"
345,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And like the actress exclaim, ""Oh my God"" at?"
346,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"There's Bungey; and for Bungey there are towns,"
347,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Whole townships named but without population.[9]
348,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
349,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Anything I can say about New Hampshire
350,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Will serve almost as well about Vermont,"
351,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Excepting that they differ in their mountains.
352,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight;
353,NEW HAMPSHIRE,New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil.
354,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
355,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains.
356,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And here I am and what am I to say?
357,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Here first my theme becomes embarrassing.
358,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Emerson said, ""The God who made New Hampshire"
359,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Taunted the lofty land with little men."""
360,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Another Massachusetts poet said,"
361,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""I go no more to summer in New Hampshire."
362,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"I've given up my summer place in Dublin."""
363,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire,"
364,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"She said she couldn't stand the people in it,"
365,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The little men (it's Massachusetts speaking).
366,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And when I asked to know what ailed the people,"
367,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"She said, ""Go read your own books and find out."""
368,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I may as well confess myself the author
369,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Of several books against the world in general.
370,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To take them as against a special state
371,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Or even nation's to restrict my meaning.
372,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"I'm what is called a sensibilitist,"
373,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Or otherwise an environmentalist.
374,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I refuse to adapt myself a mite
375,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"To any change from hot to cold, from wet"
376,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"To dry, from poor to rich, or back again."
377,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I make a virtue of my suffering
378,NEW HAMPSHIRE,From nearly everything that goes on round me.[10]
379,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"In other words, I know wherever I am,"
380,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Being the creature of literature I am,"
381,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I shall not lack for pain to keep me awake.
382,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers:
383,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Why this is Hell, nor am I out of it."""
384,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Samoa, Russia, Ireland I complain of,"
385,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"No less than England, France and Italy."
386,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire
387,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire.
388,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
389,NEW HAMPSHIRE,When I left Massachusetts years ago
390,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Between two days, the reason why I sought"
391,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"New Hampshire, not Connecticut,"
392,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this:"
393,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered"
394,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The nearest boundary to escape across.
395,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I hadn't an illusion in my hand-bag
396,NEW HAMPSHIRE,About the people being better there
397,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Than those I left behind. I thought they weren't.
398,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I thought they couldn't be. And yet they were.
399,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I'd sure had no such friends in Massachusetts
400,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"As Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson,[11]"
401,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Bartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado),"
402,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Harris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem."
403,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem
404,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To want to make New Hampshire people over.
405,NEW HAMPSHIRE,They taunt the lofty land with little men.
406,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I don't know what to say about the people.
407,NEW HAMPSHIRE,For art's sake one could almost wish them worse[12]
408,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Rather than better. How are we to write
409,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The Russian novel in America
410,NEW HAMPSHIRE,As long as life goes so unterribly?
411,NEW HAMPSHIRE,There is the pinch from which our only outcry
412,NEW HAMPSHIRE,In literature to date is heard to come.
413,NEW HAMPSHIRE,We get what little misery we can
414,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Out of not having cause for misery.
415,NEW HAMPSHIRE,It makes the guild of novel writers sick
416,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To be expected to be Dostoievskis
417,NEW HAMPSHIRE,On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort.
418,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"This is not sorrow, though; it's just the vapors,"
419,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And recognized as such in Russia itself
420,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Under the new régime, and so forbidden."
421,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"If well it is with Russia, then feel free"
422,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To say so or be stood against the wall
423,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And shot. It's Pollyanna now or death.
424,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of;"
425,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And very sensible. No state can build
426,NEW HAMPSHIRE,A literature that shall at once be sound
427,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And sad on a foundation of wellbeing.
428,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
429,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To show the level of intelligence
430,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Among us; it was just a Warren farmer
431,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road
432,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"By me, a stranger. This is what he said,"
433,NEW HAMPSHIRE,From nothing but embarrassment and want
434,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Of anything more sociable to say:
435,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""You hear those hound-dogs sing on Moosilauke?[13]"
436,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Well they remind me of the hue and cry
437,NEW HAMPSHIRE,We've heard against the Mid-Victorians
438,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And never rightly understood till Bryan
439,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Retired from politics and joined the chorus.
440,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The matter with the Mid-Victorians
441,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Seems to have been a man named John L. Darwin.""[14]"
442,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Go 'long,"" I said to him, he to his horse."
443,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
444,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I knew a man who failing as a farmer
445,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance,"
446,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And spent the proceeds on a telescope[15]
447,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To satisfy a life-long curiosity
448,NEW HAMPSHIRE,About our place among the infinities.
449,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And how was that for other-worldliness?
450,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
451,NEW HAMPSHIRE,If I must choose which I would elevate--
452,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The people or the already lofty mountains,"
453,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I'd elevate the already lofty mountains.
454,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The only fault I find with old New Hampshire
455,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Is that her mountains aren't quite high enough.
456,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I was not always so; I've come to be so.
457,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"How, to my sorrow, how have I attained"
458,NEW HAMPSHIRE,A height from which to look down critical
459,NEW HAMPSHIRE,On mountains? What has given me assurance
460,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains,"
461,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Or any mountains? Can it be some strength
462,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I feel as of an earthquake in my back
463,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To heave them higher to the morning star?
464,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Can it be foreign travel in the Alps?
465,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Or having seen and credited a moment
466,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The solid moulding of vast peaks of cloud
467,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Behind the pitiful reality
468,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Of Lincoln, Lafayette and Liberty?"
469,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Or some such sense as says how high shall jet
470,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The fountain in proportion to the basin?
471,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"No, none of these has raised me to my throne"
472,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Of intellectual dissatisfaction,"
473,NEW HAMPSHIRE,But the sad accident of having seen
474,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Our actual mountains given in a map
475,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Of early times as twice the height they are--
476,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Ten thousand feet instead of only five--
477,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Which shows how sad an accident may be.
478,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Five thousand is no longer high enough.
479,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Whereas I never had a good idea
480,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"About improving people in the world,"
481,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Here I am over-fertile in suggestion,"
482,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And cannot rest from planning day or night
483,NEW HAMPSHIRE,How high I'd thrust the peaks in summer snow
484,NEW HAMPSHIRE,To tap the upper sky and draw a flow
485,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Of frosty night air on the vale below
486,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry.
487,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
488,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The more the sensibilitist I am
489,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The more I seem to want my mountains wild;
490,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The way the wiry gang-boss liked the log-jam.[16]
491,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"After he'd picked the lock and got it started,"
492,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He dodged a log that lifted like an arm
493,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Against the sky to break his back for him,"
494,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Then came in dancing, skipping, with his life"
495,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Across the roar and chaos, and the words"
496,NEW HAMPSHIRE,We saw him say along the zigzag journey
497,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Were doubtless as the words we heard him say
498,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"On coming nearer: ""Wasn't she an _i_-deal"
499,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Son-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an _i_-deal."""
500,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
501,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"For all her mountains fall a little short,"
502,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Her people not quite short enough for Art,"
503,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"She's still New Hampshire, a most restful state."
504,NEW HAMPSHIRE,
505,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Lately in converse with a New York alec
506,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"About the new school of the pseudo-phallic,"
507,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I found myself in a close corner where
508,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I had to make an almost funny choice.
509,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Choose you which you will be--a prude, or puke,"
510,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Mewling and puking in the public arms."""
511,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Me for the hills where I don't have to choose.""[17]"
512,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""But if you had to choose, which would you be?"""
513,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I wouldn't be a prude afraid of nature.
514,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I know a man who took a double axe
515,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And went alone against a grove of trees;
516,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"But his heart failing him, he dropped the axe"
517,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold:
518,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood;"
519,NEW HAMPSHIRE,There's been enough shed without shedding mine.
520,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Remember Birnam Wood! The wood's in flux!"""
521,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He had a special terror of the flux
522,NEW HAMPSHIRE,That showed itself in dendrophobia.
523,NEW HAMPSHIRE,The only decent tree had been to mill
524,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And educated into boards, he said."
525,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He knew too well for any earthly use
526,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The line where man leaves off and nature starts,[18]"
527,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And never over-stepped it save in dreams.
528,NEW HAMPSHIRE,He stood on the safe side of the line talking;
529,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism,"
530,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"The cult of one who owned himself ""a foiled,"
531,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Circuitous wanderer,"" and ""took dejectedly"
532,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"His seat upon the intellectual throne."""
533,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Agreed in frowning on these improvised
534,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Altars the woods are full of nowadays,"
535,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned
536,NEW HAMPSHIRE,By worship under green trees in the open.
537,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Scarcely a mile but that I come on one,"
538,NEW HAMPSHIRE,A black-cheeked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal.
539,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Even to say the groves were God's first temples
540,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Comes too near to Ahaz' sin for safety.
541,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred.
542,NEW HAMPSHIRE,But here is not a question of what's sacred;
543,NEW HAMPSHIRE,Rather of what to face or run away from.
544,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I'd hate to be a runaway from nature.
545,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And neither would I choose to be a puke
546,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Who cares not what he does in company,"
547,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"And, when he can't do anything, falls back"
548,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"On words, and tries his worst to make words speak"
549,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it."
550,NEW HAMPSHIRE,It seems a narrow choice the age insists on.
551,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"How about being a good Greek, for instance?"
552,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"That course, they tell me, isn't offered this year."
553,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"""Come, but this isn't choosing--puke or prude?"""
554,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"Well, if I have to choose one or the other,"
555,NEW HAMPSHIRE,I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer
556,NEW HAMPSHIRE,With an income in cash of say a thousand
557,NEW HAMPSHIRE,(From say a publisher in New York City).
558,NEW HAMPSHIRE,"It's restful to arrive at a decision,"
559,NEW HAMPSHIRE,And restful just to think about New Hampshire.
560,NEW HAMPSHIRE,At present I am living in Vermont.

565,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT
566,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,(_For Lincoln MacVeagh_)
567,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
568,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
569,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Never tell me that not one star of all
570,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,That slip from heaven at night and softly fall
571,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.
572,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
573,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Some laborer found one faded and stone cold,"
574,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"And saving that its weight suggested gold,"
575,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"And tugged it from his first too certain hold,"
576,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
577,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He noticed nothing in it to remark.
578,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He was not used to handling stars thrown dark
579,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,And lifeless from an interrupted arc.
580,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
581,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He did not recognize in that smooth coal
582,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,The one thing palpable besides the soul
583,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,To penetrate the air in which we roll.
584,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
585,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He did not see how like a flying thing
586,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"It brooded ant-eggs, and had one large wing,"
587,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"One not so large for flying in a ring,"
588,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
589,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"And a long Bird of Paradise's tail,"
590,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,(Though these when not in use to fly and trail
591,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,It drew back in its body like a snail);
592,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
593,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Nor know that he might move it from the spot
594,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,The harm was done; from having been star-shot
595,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,The very nature of the soil was hot
596,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
597,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,"
598,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain
599,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.
600,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
601,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"He moved it roughly with an iron bar,"
602,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He loaded an old stone-boat with the star
603,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"And not, as you might think, a flying car,"
604,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
605,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Such as even poets would admit perforce
606,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,More practical than Pegasus the horse
607,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,If it could put a star back in its course.
608,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
609,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He dragged it through the ploughed ground at a pace
610,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,But faintly reminiscent of the race
611,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Of jostling rock in interstellar space.
612,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
613,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"It went for building stone, and I, as though"
614,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Commanded in a dream, forever go"
615,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,To right the wrong that this should have been so.
616,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
617,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,"
618,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,I do not know--I cannot stop to tell:
619,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,He might have left it lying where it fell.
620,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
621,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,From following walls I never lift my eye
622,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Except at night to places in the sky
623,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Where showers of charted meteors let fly.
624,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
625,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Some may know what they seek in school and church,"
626,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,And why they seek it there; for what I search
627,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;"
628,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
629,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Sure that though not a star of death and birth,"
630,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth"
631,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth,"
632,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
633,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Though not, I say, a star of death and sin,"
634,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"It yet has poles, and only needs a spin"
635,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,To show its worldly nature and begin
636,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
637,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm
638,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,And run off in strange tangents with my arm
639,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,As fish do with the line in first alarm.
640,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
641,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"Such as it is, it promises the prize"
642,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,Of the one world complete in any size
643,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,"That I am like to compass, fool or wise."
644,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
645,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
646,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
647,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT,
648,THE CENSUS-TAKER,THE CENSUS-TAKER
649,THE CENSUS-TAKER,
650,THE CENSUS-TAKER,
651,THE CENSUS-TAKER,I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening
652,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house"
653,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"Of one room and one window and one door,"
654,THE CENSUS-TAKER,The only dwelling in a waste cut over
655,THE CENSUS-TAKER,A hundred square miles round it in the mountains:
656,THE CENSUS-TAKER,And that not dwelt in now by men or women
657,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,"
658,THE CENSUS-TAKER,So what is this I make a sorrow of?)
659,THE CENSUS-TAKER,I came as census-taker to the waste
660,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"To count the people in it and found none,"
661,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"None in the hundred miles, none in the house,"
662,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"Where I came last with some hope, but not much"
663,THE CENSUS-TAKER,After hours' overlooking from the cliffs
664,THE CENSUS-TAKER,An emptiness flayed to the very stone.
665,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"I found no people that dared show themselves,"
666,THE CENSUS-TAKER,None not in hiding from the outward eye.
667,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"The time was autumn, but how anyone"
668,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Could tell the time of year when every tree
669,THE CENSUS-TAKER,That could have dropped a leaf was down itself
670,THE CENSUS-TAKER,And nothing but the stump of it was left
671,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;
672,THE CENSUS-TAKER,And every tree up stood a rotting trunk
673,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,"
674,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Or branch to whistle after what was spent.
675,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Perhaps the wind the more without the help
676,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Of breathing trees said something of the time
677,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Of year or day the way it swung a door
678,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"Forever off the latch, as if rude men"
679,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him
680,THE CENSUS-TAKER,For the next one to open for himself.
681,THE CENSUS-TAKER,I counted nine I had no right to count
682,THE CENSUS-TAKER,(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)
683,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Before I made the tenth across the threshold.
684,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Where was my supper? Where was anyone's?
685,THE CENSUS-TAKER,No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.
686,THE CENSUS-TAKER,The stove was cold--the stove was off the chimney--
687,THE CENSUS-TAKER,And down by one side where it lacked a leg.
688,THE CENSUS-TAKER,The people that had loudly passed the door
689,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Were people to the ear but not the eye.
690,THE CENSUS-TAKER,They were not on the table with their elbows.
691,THE CENSUS-TAKER,They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.
692,THE CENSUS-TAKER,I saw no men there and no bones of men there.
693,THE CENSUS-TAKER,I armed myself against such bones as might be
694,THE CENSUS-TAKER,With the pitch-blackened stub of an axe-handle
695,THE CENSUS-TAKER,I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.
696,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled."
697,THE CENSUS-TAKER,The door was still because I held it shut
698,THE CENSUS-TAKER,While I thought what to do that could be done--
699,THE CENSUS-TAKER,About the house--about the people not there.
700,THE CENSUS-TAKER,This house in one year fallen to decay
701,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses
702,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years
703,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.
704,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Nothing was left to do that I could see
705,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Unless to find that there was no one there
706,THE CENSUS-TAKER,And declare to the cliffs too far for echo
707,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"""The place is desert and let whoso lurks"
708,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"In silence, if in this he is aggrieved,"
709,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Break silence now or be forever silent.
710,THE CENSUS-TAKER,"Let him say why it should not be declared so."""
711,THE CENSUS-TAKER,The melancholy of having to count souls
712,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Where they grow fewer and fewer every year
713,THE CENSUS-TAKER,Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.

722,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"""You know Orion always comes up sideways."
723,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,"
724,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"And rising on his hands, he looks in on me"
725,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something
726,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"I should have done by daylight, and indeed,"
727,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"After the ground is frozen, I should have done"
728,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful"
729,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
730,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"To make fun of my way of doing things,"
731,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Or else fun of Orion's having caught me.
732,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights"
733,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"These forces are obliged to pay respect to?"""
734,THE STAR-SPLITTER,So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk
735,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,"
736,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,"
737,THE STAR-SPLITTER,He burned his house down for the fire insurance
738,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And spent the proceeds on a telescope
739,THE STAR-SPLITTER,To satisfy a life-long curiosity
740,THE STAR-SPLITTER,About our place among the infinities.
741,THE STAR-SPLITTER,
742,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"""What do you want with one of those blame things?"""
743,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"I asked him well beforehand. ""Don't you get one!"""
744,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"""Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything"
745,THE STAR-SPLITTER,More blameless in the sense of being less
746,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"A weapon in our human fight,"" he said."
747,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"""I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it."""
748,THE STAR-SPLITTER,There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
749,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move
750,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years
751,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,"
752,THE STAR-SPLITTER,He burned his house down for the fire insurance
753,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And bought the telescope with what it came to.
754,THE STAR-SPLITTER,He had been heard to say by several:
755,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"""The best thing that we're put here for's to see;"
756,THE STAR-SPLITTER,The strongest thing that's given us to see with's
757,THE STAR-SPLITTER,A telescope. Someone in every town
758,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.
759,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"In Littleton it may as well be me."""
760,THE STAR-SPLITTER,After such loose talk it was no surprise
761,THE STAR-SPLITTER,When he did what he did and burned his house down.
762,THE STAR-SPLITTER,
763,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Mean laughter went about the town that day
764,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"To let him know we weren't the least imposed on,"
765,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And he could wait--we'd see to him to-morrow.
766,THE STAR-SPLITTER,But the first thing next morning we reflected
767,THE STAR-SPLITTER,If one by one we counted people out
768,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long"
769,THE STAR-SPLITTER,To get so we had no one left to live with.
770,THE STAR-SPLITTER,For to be social is to be forgiving.
771,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,"
772,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"We don't cut off from coming to church suppers,"
773,THE STAR-SPLITTER,But what we miss we go to him and ask for.
774,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"He promptly gives it back, that is if still"
775,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of."
776,THE STAR-SPLITTER,It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad
777,THE STAR-SPLITTER,About his telescope. Beyond the age
778,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Of being given one's gift for Christmas,"
779,THE STAR-SPLITTER,He had to take the best way he knew how
780,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"To find himself in one. Well, all we said was"
781,THE STAR-SPLITTER,He took a strange thing to be roguish over.
782,THE STAR-SPLITTER,
783,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Some sympathy was wasted on the house,"
784,THE STAR-SPLITTER,A good old-timer dating back along;
785,THE STAR-SPLITTER,But a house isn't sentient; the house
786,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Didn't feel anything. And if it did,"
787,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Why not regard it as a sacrifice,"
788,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,"
789,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?
790,THE STAR-SPLITTER,
791,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Out of a house and so out of a farm
792,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn"
793,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"To earn a living on the Concord railroad,"
794,THE STAR-SPLITTER,As under-ticket-agent at a station
795,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets,"
796,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Was setting out up track and down, not plants"
797,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"As on a farm, but planets, evening stars"
798,THE STAR-SPLITTER,That varied in their hue from red to green.
799,THE STAR-SPLITTER,
800,THE STAR-SPLITTER,He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.
801,THE STAR-SPLITTER,His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing.
802,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Often he bid me come and have a look
803,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,"
804,THE STAR-SPLITTER,At a star quaking in the other end.
805,THE STAR-SPLITTER,I recollect a night of broken clouds
806,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"And underfoot snow melted down to ice,"
807,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And melting further in the wind to mud.
808,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Bradford and I had out the telescope.
809,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"We spread our two legs as we spread its three,"
810,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,"
811,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"And standing at our leisure till the day broke,"
812,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Said some of the best things we ever said.[19]
813,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"That telescope was christened the Star-splitter,"
814,THE STAR-SPLITTER,Because it didn't do a thing but split
815,THE STAR-SPLITTER,A star in two or three the way you split
816,THE STAR-SPLITTER,A globule of quicksilver in your hand
817,THE STAR-SPLITTER,With one stroke of your finger in the middle.
818,THE STAR-SPLITTER,It's a star-splitter if there ever was one
819,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And ought to do some good if splitting stars
820,THE STAR-SPLITTER,'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.
821,THE STAR-SPLITTER,
822,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"We've looked and looked, but after all where are we?"
823,THE STAR-SPLITTER,"Do we know any better where we are,"
824,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And how it stands between the night to-night
825,THE STAR-SPLITTER,And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
826,THE STAR-SPLITTER,How different from the way it ever stood?

832,MAPLE,
833,MAPLE,
834,MAPLE,Her teacher's certainty it must be Mabel
835,MAPLE,Made Maple first take notice of her name.
836,MAPLE,"She asked her father and he told her ""Maple--"
837,MAPLE,"Maple is right."""
838,MAPLE,"""But teacher told the school"
839,MAPLE,"There's no such name."""
840,MAPLE,"""Teachers don't know as much"
841,MAPLE,"As fathers about children, you tell teacher."
842,MAPLE,You tell her that it's M-A-P-L-E.
843,MAPLE,You ask her if she knows a maple tree.
844,MAPLE,"Well, you were named after a maple tree."
845,MAPLE,Your mother named you. You and she just saw
846,MAPLE,"Each other in passing in the room upstairs,"
847,MAPLE,"One coming this way into life, and one"
848,MAPLE,Going the other out of life--you know?
849,MAPLE,So you can't have much recollection of her.
850,MAPLE,She had been having a long look at you.
851,MAPLE,She put her finger in your cheek so hard
852,MAPLE,"It must have made your dimple there, and said,"
853,MAPLE,"'Maple.' I said it too: 'Yes, for her name.'"
854,MAPLE,She nodded. So we're sure there's no mistake.
855,MAPLE,"I don't know what she wanted it to mean,"
856,MAPLE,But it seems like some word she left to bid you
857,MAPLE,Be a good girl--be like a maple tree.
858,MAPLE,How like a maple tree's for us to guess.
859,MAPLE,Or for a little girl to guess sometime.
860,MAPLE,Not now--at least I shouldn't try too hard now.
861,MAPLE,By and by I will tell you all I know
862,MAPLE,"About the different trees, and something, too,"
863,MAPLE,"About your mother that perhaps may help."""
864,MAPLE,Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.
865,MAPLE,Luckily all she wanted of her name then
866,MAPLE,"Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day,"
867,MAPLE,And give the teacher a scare as from her father.
868,MAPLE,"Anything further had been wasted on her,"
869,MAPLE,Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.
870,MAPLE,She would forget it. She all but forgot it.
871,MAPLE,"What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,"
872,MAPLE,"And came so near death in the dark of years,"
873,MAPLE,That when it woke and came to life again
874,MAPLE,The flower was different from the parent seed.
875,MAPLE,"It came back vaguely at the glass one day,"
876,MAPLE,"As she stood saying her name over aloud,"
877,MAPLE,Striking it gently across her lowered eyes
878,MAPLE,To make it go well with the way she looked.
879,MAPLE,What was it about her name? Its strangeness lay
880,MAPLE,"In having too much meaning. Other names,"
881,MAPLE,"As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,"
882,MAPLE,"Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,"
883,MAPLE,But hadn't as it went. (She knew a Rose.)
884,MAPLE,This difference from other names it was
885,MAPLE,Made people notice it--and notice her.
886,MAPLE,"(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)"
887,MAPLE,Her problem was to find out what it asked
888,MAPLE,In dress or manner of the girl who bore it.
889,MAPLE,If she could form some notion of her mother--
890,MAPLE,"What she had thought was lovely, and what good."
891,MAPLE,This was her mother's childhood home;
892,MAPLE,"The house one story high in front, three stories"
893,MAPLE,On the end it presented to the road.
894,MAPLE,(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)
895,MAPLE,"Her mother's bedroom was her father's still,"
896,MAPLE,Where she could watch her mother's picture fading.
897,MAPLE,Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible
898,MAPLE,A maple leaf she thought must have been laid
899,MAPLE,In wait for her there. She read every word
900,MAPLE,Of the two pages it was pressed between
901,MAPLE,As if it was her mother speaking to her.
902,MAPLE,But forgot to put the leaf back in closing
903,MAPLE,And lost the place never to read again.
904,MAPLE,"She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it."
905,MAPLE,
906,MAPLE,"So she looked for herself, as everyone"
907,MAPLE,"Looks for himself, more or less outwardly."
908,MAPLE,"And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,"
909,MAPLE,"May still have been what led her on to read,"
910,MAPLE,"And think a little, and get some city schooling."
911,MAPLE,"She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand may"
912,MAPLE,Have had to do with it--she sometimes wondered.
913,MAPLE,"So, till she found herself in a strange place"
914,MAPLE,"For the name Maple to have brought her to,"
915,MAPLE,"Taking dictation on a paper pad,"
916,MAPLE,And in the pauses when she raised her eyes
917,MAPLE,Watching out of a nineteenth story window
918,MAPLE,An airship laboring with unship-like motion
919,MAPLE,And a vague all-disturbing roar above the river
920,MAPLE,Beyond the highest city built with hands.
921,MAPLE,Someone was saying in such natural tones
922,MAPLE,"She almost wrote the words down on her knee,"
923,MAPLE,"""Do you know you remind me of a tree--"
924,MAPLE,"A maple tree?"""
925,MAPLE,"""Because my name is Maple?"""
926,MAPLE,
927,MAPLE,"""Isn't it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel."""
928,MAPLE,
929,MAPLE,"""No doubt you've heard the office call me Mabel."
930,MAPLE,"I have to let them call me what they like."""
931,MAPLE,
932,MAPLE,They were both stirred that he should have divined
933,MAPLE,Without the name her personal mystery.
934,MAPLE,It made it seem as if there must be something
935,MAPLE,"She must have missed herself. So they were married,"
936,MAPLE,And took the fancy home with them to live by.
937,MAPLE,
938,MAPLE,They went on pilgrimage once to her father's
939,MAPLE,"(The house one story high in front, three stories"
940,MAPLE,On the side it presented to the road)
941,MAPLE,To see if there was not some special tree
942,MAPLE,"She might have overlooked. They could find none,"
943,MAPLE,"Not so much as a single tree for shade,"
944,MAPLE,Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.
945,MAPLE,She told him of the bookmark maple leaf
946,MAPLE,"In the big Bible, and all she remembered"
947,MAPLE,"Of the place marked with it--""Wave offering,"
948,MAPLE,"Something about wave offering, it said."""
949,MAPLE,
950,MAPLE,"""You've never asked your father outright, have you?"""
951,MAPLE,
952,MAPLE,"""I have, and been put off sometime, I think."""
953,MAPLE,(This was her faded memory of the way
954,MAPLE,Once long ago her father had put himself off.)
955,MAPLE,
956,MAPLE,"""Because no telling but it may have been"
957,MAPLE,Something between your father and your mother
958,MAPLE,"Not meant for us at all."""
959,MAPLE,"""Not meant for me?"
960,MAPLE,Where would the fairness be in giving me
961,MAPLE,"A name to carry for life, and never know"
962,MAPLE,"The secret of?"""
963,MAPLE,"""And then it may have been"
964,MAPLE,Something a father couldn't tell a daughter
965,MAPLE,As well as could a mother. And again
966,MAPLE,It may have been their one lapse into fancy
967,MAPLE,'Twould be too bad to make him sorry for
968,MAPLE,By bringing it up to him when he was too old.
969,MAPLE,"Your father feels us round him with our questing,"
970,MAPLE,"And holds us off unnecessarily,"
971,MAPLE,As if he didn't know what little thing
972,MAPLE,Might lead us on to a discovery.
973,MAPLE,It was as personal as he could be
974,MAPLE,About the way he saw it was with you
975,MAPLE,"To say your mother, had she lived, would be"
976,MAPLE,"As far again as from being born to bearing."""
977,MAPLE,
978,MAPLE,"""Just one look more with what you say in mind,"
979,MAPLE,"And I give up""; which last look came to nothing."
980,MAPLE,"But, though they now gave up the search forever,"
981,MAPLE,They clung to what one had seen in the other
982,MAPLE,By inspiration. It proved there was something.
983,MAPLE,They kept their thoughts away from when the maples
984,MAPLE,"Stood uniform in buckets, and the steam"
985,MAPLE,Of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house.
986,MAPLE,"When they made her related to the maples,"
987,MAPLE,It was the tree the autumn fire ran through
988,MAPLE,"And swept of leathern leaves, but left the bark"
989,MAPLE,"Unscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke."
990,MAPLE,They always took their holidays in autumn.
991,MAPLE,"Once they came on a maple in a glade,"
992,MAPLE,"Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,"
993,MAPLE,And every leaf of foliage she'd worn
994,MAPLE,Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.
995,MAPLE,But its age kept them from considering this one.
996,MAPLE,Twenty-five years ago at Maple's naming
997,MAPLE,It hardly could have been a two-leaved seedling
998,MAPLE,The next cow might have licked up out at pasture.
999,MAPLE,Could it have been another maple like it?
1000,MAPLE,"They hovered for a moment near discovery,"
1001,MAPLE,"Figurative enough to see the symbol,"
1002,MAPLE,But lacking faith in anything to mean
1003,MAPLE,The same at different times to different people.
1004,MAPLE,Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them
1005,MAPLE,From thinking it could be a thing so bridal.
1006,MAPLE,And anyway it came too late for Maple.
1007,MAPLE,She used her hands to cover up her eyes.
1008,MAPLE,"""We would not see the secret if we could now:"
1009,MAPLE,"We are not looking for it any more."""
1010,MAPLE,
1011,MAPLE,"Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,"
1012,MAPLE,"Made a girl's marriage, and ruled in her life."
1013,MAPLE,No matter that the meaning was not clear.
1014,MAPLE,"A name with meaning could bring up a child,"
1015,MAPLE,Taking the child out of the parents' hands.
1016,MAPLE,"Better a meaningless name, I should say,"
1017,MAPLE,As leaving more to nature and happy chance.
1018,MAPLE,Name children some names and see what you do.

1026,THE AXE-HELVE,I've known ere now an interfering branch
1027,THE AXE-HELVE,Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me.
1028,THE AXE-HELVE,"But that was in the woods, to hold my hand"
1029,THE AXE-HELVE,"From striking at another alder's roots,"
1030,THE AXE-HELVE,"And that was, as I say, an alder branch."
1031,THE AXE-HELVE,"This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day"
1032,THE AXE-HELVE,Behind me on the snow in my own yard
1033,THE AXE-HELVE,"Where I was working at the chopping-block,"
1034,THE AXE-HELVE,And cutting nothing not cut down already.
1035,THE AXE-HELVE,"He caught my axe expertly on the rise,"
1036,THE AXE-HELVE,"When all my strength put forth was in his favor,"
1037,THE AXE-HELVE,"Held it a moment where it was, to calm me,"
1038,THE AXE-HELVE,Then took it from me--and I let him take it.
1039,THE AXE-HELVE,I didn't know him well enough to know
1040,THE AXE-HELVE,What it was all about. There might be something
1041,THE AXE-HELVE,He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor
1042,THE AXE-HELVE,He might prefer to say to him disarmed.
1043,THE AXE-HELVE,But all he had to tell me in French-English
1044,THE AXE-HELVE,"Was what he thought of--not me, but my axe;"
1045,THE AXE-HELVE,Me only as I took my axe to heart.
1046,THE AXE-HELVE,It was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me--
1047,THE AXE-HELVE,"""Made on machine,"" he said, ploughing the grain"
1048,THE AXE-HELVE,With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran
1049,THE AXE-HELVE,"Across the handle's long drawn serpentine,"

1065,THE AXE-HELVE,
1066,THE AXE-HELVE,Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove
1067,THE AXE-HELVE,My welcome differed from no other welcome.
1068,THE AXE-HELVE,Baptiste knew best why I was where I was.
1069,THE AXE-HELVE,"So long as he would leave enough unsaid,"
1070,THE AXE-HELVE,I shouldn't mind his being overjoyed
1071,THE AXE-HELVE,(If overjoyed he was) at having got me
1072,THE AXE-HELVE,Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe
1073,THE AXE-HELVE,That not everybody else knew was to count
1074,THE AXE-HELVE,For nothing in the measure of a neighbor.
1075,THE AXE-HELVE,"Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees,"
1076,THE AXE-HELVE,A Frenchman couldn't get his human rating!
1077,THE AXE-HELVE,
1078,THE AXE-HELVE,Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair
1079,THE AXE-HELVE,That had as many motions as the world:
1080,THE AXE-HELVE,"One back and forward, in and out of shadow,"
1081,THE AXE-HELVE,"That got her nowhere; one more gradual,"
1082,THE AXE-HELVE,"Sideways, that would have run her on the stove"
1083,THE AXE-HELVE,"In time, had she not realized her danger"
1084,THE AXE-HELVE,"And caught herself up bodily, chair and all,"

1087,THE AXE-HELVE,
1088,THE AXE-HELVE,"I was afraid, in brightening first on me,"
1089,THE AXE-HELVE,"Then on Baptiste, as if she understood"
1090,THE AXE-HELVE,"What passed between us, she was only feigning."
1091,THE AXE-HELVE,Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more
1092,THE AXE-HELVE,"Than for himself, so placed he couldn't hope"
1093,THE AXE-HELVE,To keep his bargain of the morning with me
1094,THE AXE-HELVE,In time to keep me from suspecting him
1095,THE AXE-HELVE,Of really never having meant to keep it.
1096,THE AXE-HELVE,
1097,THE AXE-HELVE,"Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,"
1098,THE AXE-HELVE,"A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me"
1099,THE AXE-HELVE,"To have the best he had, or had to spare--"
1100,THE AXE-HELVE,"Not for me to ask which, when what he took"
1101,THE AXE-HELVE,Had beauties he had to point me out at length
1102,THE AXE-HELVE,To insure their not being wasted on me.
1103,THE AXE-HELVE,"He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,"
1104,THE AXE-HELVE,"Free from the least knot, equal to the strain"
1105,THE AXE-HELVE,Of bending like a sword across the knee.
1106,THE AXE-HELVE,He showed me that the lines of a good helve
1107,THE AXE-HELVE,Were native to the grain before the knife
1108,THE AXE-HELVE,"Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves"
1109,THE AXE-HELVE,Put on it from without. And there its strength lay
1110,THE AXE-HELVE,For the hard work. He chafed its long white body
1111,THE AXE-HELVE,From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.
1112,THE AXE-HELVE,He tried it at the eye-hole in the axe-head.
1113,THE AXE-HELVE,"""Hahn, hahn,"" he mused, ""don't need much taking down."""
1114,THE AXE-HELVE,Baptiste knew how to make a short job long
1115,THE AXE-HELVE,"For love of it, and yet not waste time either."
1116,THE AXE-HELVE,
1117,THE AXE-HELVE,"Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?"
1118,THE AXE-HELVE,Baptiste on his defence about the children
1119,THE AXE-HELVE,"He kept from school, or did his best to keep--"
1120,THE AXE-HELVE,Whatever school and children and our doubts
1121,THE AXE-HELVE,Of laid-on education had to do
1122,THE AXE-HELVE,With the curves of his axe-helves and his having
1123,THE AXE-HELVE,Used these unscrupulously to bring me
1124,THE AXE-HELVE,To see for once the inside of his house.
1125,THE AXE-HELVE,"Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one"
1126,THE AXE-HELVE,"To leave it to, whether the right to hold"
1127,THE AXE-HELVE,Such doubts of education should depend
1128,THE AXE-HELVE,Upon the education of those who held them?
1129,THE AXE-HELVE,
1130,THE AXE-HELVE,But now he brushed the shavings from his knee
1131,THE AXE-HELVE,"And stood the axe there on its horse's hoof,"
1132,THE AXE-HELVE,"Erect, but not without its waves, as when"
1133,THE AXE-HELVE,"The snake stood up for evil in the Garden,--"
1134,THE AXE-HELVE,"Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,"
1135,THE AXE-HELVE,"Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down"
1136,THE AXE-HELVE,And in a little--a French touch in that.
1137,THE AXE-HELVE,"Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;"
1138,THE AXE-HELVE,"""See how she's cock her head!"""

1143,THE GRINDSTONE,THE GRINDSTONE
1144,THE GRINDSTONE,
1145,THE GRINDSTONE,
1146,THE GRINDSTONE,Having a wheel and four legs of its own
1147,THE GRINDSTONE,Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone
1148,THE GRINDSTONE,To get it anywhere that I can see.
1149,THE GRINDSTONE,"These hands have helped it go, and even race;"
1150,THE GRINDSTONE,"Not all the motion, though, they ever lent,"
1151,THE GRINDSTONE,"Not all the miles it may have thought it went,"
1152,THE GRINDSTONE,Have got it one step from the starting place.
1153,THE GRINDSTONE,It stands beside the same old apple tree.
1154,THE GRINDSTONE,The shadow of the apple tree is thin
1155,THE GRINDSTONE,"Upon it now, its feet are fast in snow."
1156,THE GRINDSTONE,"All other farm machinery's gone in,"
1157,THE GRINDSTONE,And some of it on no more legs and wheel
1158,THE GRINDSTONE,Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go.
1159,THE GRINDSTONE,(I'm thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.)
1160,THE GRINDSTONE,"For months it hasn't known the taste of steel,"
1161,THE GRINDSTONE,Washed down with rusty water in a tin.
1162,THE GRINDSTONE,"But standing outdoors hungry, in the cold,"
1163,THE GRINDSTONE,"Except in towns at night, is not a sin."
1164,THE GRINDSTONE,"And, anyway, its standing in the yard"
1165,THE GRINDSTONE,Under a ruinous live apple tree
1166,THE GRINDSTONE,"Has nothing any more to do with me,"
1167,THE GRINDSTONE,Except that I remember how of old
1168,THE GRINDSTONE,"One summer day, all day I drove it hard,"
1169,THE GRINDSTONE,"And someone mounted on it rode it hard,"
1170,THE GRINDSTONE,And he and I between us ground a blade.
1171,THE GRINDSTONE,
1172,THE GRINDSTONE,"I gave it the preliminary spin,"
1173,THE GRINDSTONE,And poured on water (tears it might have been);
1174,THE GRINDSTONE,"And when it almost gayly jumped and flowed,"
1175,THE GRINDSTONE,"A Father-Time-like man got on and rode,"
1176,THE GRINDSTONE,Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed.
1177,THE GRINDSTONE,He turned on will-power to increase the load
1178,THE GRINDSTONE,"And slow me down--and I abruptly slowed,"
1179,THE GRINDSTONE,Like coming to a sudden railroad station.
1180,THE GRINDSTONE,I changed from hand to hand in desperation.
1181,THE GRINDSTONE,I wondered what machine of ages gone
1182,THE GRINDSTONE,This represented an improvement on.
1183,THE GRINDSTONE,For all I knew it may have sharpened spears
1184,THE GRINDSTONE,And arrowheads itself. Much use for years
1185,THE GRINDSTONE,Had gradually worn it an oblate
1186,THE GRINDSTONE,"Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait,"
1187,THE GRINDSTONE,Appearing to return me hate for hate;
1188,THE GRINDSTONE,(But I forgive it now as easily
1189,THE GRINDSTONE,As any other boyhood enemy
1190,THE GRINDSTONE,Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere).
1191,THE GRINDSTONE,I wondered who it was the man thought ground--
1192,THE GRINDSTONE,The one who held the wheel back or the one
1193,THE GRINDSTONE,Who gave his life to keep it going round?
1194,THE GRINDSTONE,I wondered if he really thought it fair
1195,THE GRINDSTONE,For him to have the say when we were done.
1196,THE GRINDSTONE,Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned.
1197,THE GRINDSTONE,
1198,THE GRINDSTONE,Not for myself was I so much concerned.
1199,THE GRINDSTONE,"Oh no!--although, of course, I could have found"
1200,THE GRINDSTONE,A better way to pass the afternoon
1201,THE GRINDSTONE,"Than grinding discord out of a grindstone,"
1202,THE GRINDSTONE,And beating insects at their gritty tune.
1203,THE GRINDSTONE,Nor was I for the man so much concerned.
1204,THE GRINDSTONE,Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing
1205,THE GRINDSTONE,It looked as if he might be badly thrown
1206,THE GRINDSTONE,"And wounded on his blade. So far from caring,"
1207,THE GRINDSTONE,"I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster,"
1208,THE GRINDSTONE,(It ran as if it wasn't greased but glued);
1209,THE GRINDSTONE,I'd welcome any moderate disaster
1210,THE GRINDSTONE,That might be calculated to postpone
1211,THE GRINDSTONE,What evidently nothing could conclude.
1212,THE GRINDSTONE,The thing that made me more and more afraid
1213,THE GRINDSTONE,"Was that we'd ground it sharp and hadn't known,"
1214,THE GRINDSTONE,And now were only wasting precious blade.
1215,THE GRINDSTONE,And when he raised it dripping once and tried
1216,THE GRINDSTONE,"The creepy edge of it with wary touch,"
1217,THE GRINDSTONE,"And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed,"
1218,THE GRINDSTONE,Only disinterestedly to decide
1219,THE GRINDSTONE,"It needed a turn more, I could have cried"
1220,THE GRINDSTONE,Wasn't there danger of a turn too much?
1221,THE GRINDSTONE,Mightn't we make it worse instead of better?
1222,THE GRINDSTONE,I was for leaving something to the whetter.
1223,THE GRINDSTONE,What if it wasn't all it should be? I'd
1224,THE GRINDSTONE,Be satisfied if he'd be satisfied.
1225,THE GRINDSTONE,
1226,THE GRINDSTONE,
1227,THE GRINDSTONE,
1228,THE GRINDSTONE,
1229,PAUL'S WIFE,PAUL'S WIFE
1230,PAUL'S WIFE,
1231,PAUL'S WIFE,
1232,PAUL'S WIFE,To drive Paul out of any lumber camp
1233,PAUL'S WIFE,"All that was needed was to say to him,"
1234,PAUL'S WIFE,"""How is the wife, Paul?""--and he'd disappear."
1235,PAUL'S WIFE,"Some said it was because he had no wife,"
1236,PAUL'S WIFE,And hated to be twitted on the subject.
1237,PAUL'S WIFE,Others because he'd come within a day
1238,PAUL'S WIFE,"Or so of having one, and then been jilted."
1239,PAUL'S WIFE,"Others because he'd had one once, a good one,"
1240,PAUL'S WIFE,Who'd run away with some one else and left him.
1241,PAUL'S WIFE,And others still because he had one now
1242,PAUL'S WIFE,"He only had to be reminded of,--"
1243,PAUL'S WIFE,He was all duty to her in a minute:
1244,PAUL'S WIFE,"He had to run right off to look her up,"
1245,PAUL'S WIFE,"As if to say, ""That's so, how is my wife?"
1246,PAUL'S WIFE,"I hope she isn't getting into mischief."""
1247,PAUL'S WIFE,No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.
1248,PAUL'S WIFE,He'd been the hero of the mountain camps
1249,PAUL'S WIFE,"Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped"
1250,PAUL'S WIFE,"The bark of a whole tamarack off whole,"
1251,PAUL'S WIFE,As clean as boys do off a willow twig
1252,PAUL'S WIFE,To make a willow whistle on a Sunday
1253,PAUL'S WIFE,In April by subsiding meadow brooks.
1254,PAUL'S WIFE,"They seemed to ask him just to see him go,"
1255,PAUL'S WIFE,"""How is the wife, Paul?"" and he always went."
1256,PAUL'S WIFE,He never stopped to murder anyone
1257,PAUL'S WIFE,Who asked the question. He just disappeared--
1258,PAUL'S WIFE,"Nobody knew in what direction,"
1259,PAUL'S WIFE,Although it wasn't usually long
1260,PAUL'S WIFE,"Before they heard of him in some new camp,"
1261,PAUL'S WIFE,The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.
1262,PAUL'S WIFE,The question everywhere was why should Paul
1263,PAUL'S WIFE,Object to being asked a civil question--
1264,PAUL'S WIFE,A man you could say almost anything to
1265,PAUL'S WIFE,Short of a fighting word. You have the answers.
1266,PAUL'S WIFE,And there was one more not so fair to Paul:
1267,PAUL'S WIFE,That Paul had married a wife not his equal.
1268,PAUL'S WIFE,"Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero,"
1269,PAUL'S WIFE,She would have had to be a heroine;
1270,PAUL'S WIFE,Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.
1271,PAUL'S WIFE,"But if the story Murphy told was true,"
1272,PAUL'S WIFE,She wasn't anything to be ashamed of.
1273,PAUL'S WIFE,
1274,PAUL'S WIFE,You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone's
1275,PAUL'S WIFE,Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load
1276,PAUL'S WIFE,That wouldn't budge until they simply stretched
1277,PAUL'S WIFE,Their rawhide harness from the load to camp.
1278,PAUL'S WIFE,"Paul told the boss the load would be all right,"
1279,PAUL'S WIFE,"""The sun will bring your load in""--and it did--"
1280,PAUL'S WIFE,By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.
1281,PAUL'S WIFE,That's what is called a stretcher. But I guess
1282,PAUL'S WIFE,The one about his jumping so's to land
1283,PAUL'S WIFE,"With both his feet at once against the ceiling,"
1284,PAUL'S WIFE,"And then land safely right side up again,"
1285,PAUL'S WIFE,"Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact."
1286,PAUL'S WIFE,Well this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife
1287,PAUL'S WIFE,"Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there,"
1288,PAUL'S WIFE,"And, as you might say, saw the lady born."
1289,PAUL'S WIFE,Paul worked at anything in lumbering.
1290,PAUL'S WIFE,He'd been hard at it taking boards away
1291,PAUL'S WIFE,For--I forget--the last ambitious sawyer
1292,PAUL'S WIFE,To want to find out if he couldn't pile
1293,PAUL'S WIFE,The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.
1294,PAUL'S WIFE,"They'd sliced the first slab off a big butt log,"
1295,PAUL'S WIFE,And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back
1296,PAUL'S WIFE,To slam end on again against the saw teeth.
1297,PAUL'S WIFE,To judge them by the way they caught themselves
1298,PAUL'S WIFE,"When they saw what had happened to the log,"
1299,PAUL'S WIFE,They must have had a guilty expectation
1300,PAUL'S WIFE,Something was going to go with their slambanging.
1301,PAUL'S WIFE,Something had left a broad black streak of grease
1302,PAUL'S WIFE,On the new wood the whole length of the log
1303,PAUL'S WIFE,"Except, perhaps, a foot at either end."
1304,PAUL'S WIFE,"But when Paul put his finger in the grease,"
1305,PAUL'S WIFE,"It wasn't grease at all, but a long slot."
1306,PAUL'S WIFE,The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.
1307,PAUL'S WIFE,"""First time I ever saw a hollow pine."
1308,PAUL'S WIFE,That comes of having Paul around the place.
1309,PAUL'S WIFE,"Take it to hell for me,"" the sawyer said."
1310,PAUL'S WIFE,"Everyone had to have a look at it,"
1311,PAUL'S WIFE,And tell Paul what he ought to do about it.
1312,PAUL'S WIFE,"(They treated it as his.) ""You take a jack-knife,"
1313,PAUL'S WIFE,"And spread the opening, and you've got a dug-out"
1314,PAUL'S WIFE,"All dug to go a-fishing in."" To Paul"
1315,PAUL'S WIFE,The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty
1316,PAUL'S WIFE,Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees.
1317,PAUL'S WIFE,There was no entrance for them to get in by.
1318,PAUL'S WIFE,It looked to him like some new kind of hollow
1319,PAUL'S WIFE,He thought he'd _better_ take his jack-knife to.
1320,PAUL'S WIFE,So after work that evening he came back
1321,PAUL'S WIFE,And let enough light into it by cutting
1322,PAUL'S WIFE,To see if it was empty. He made out in there
1323,PAUL'S WIFE,"A slender length of pith, or was it pith?"
1324,PAUL'S WIFE,It might have been the skin a snake had cast
1325,PAUL'S WIFE,And left stood up on end inside the tree
1326,PAUL'S WIFE,The hundred years the tree must have been growing.
1327,PAUL'S WIFE,"More cutting and he had this in both hands,"
1328,PAUL'S WIFE,"And, looking from it to the pond near by,"
1329,PAUL'S WIFE,Paul wondered how it would respond to water.
1330,PAUL'S WIFE,"Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air"
1331,PAUL'S WIFE,He made in walking slowly to the beach
1332,PAUL'S WIFE,Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it.
1333,PAUL'S WIFE,He laid it at the edge where it could drink.
1334,PAUL'S WIFE,At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.
1335,PAUL'S WIFE,At the next drink it grew invisible.
1336,PAUL'S WIFE,"Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,"
1337,PAUL'S WIFE,And thought it must have melted. It was gone.
1338,PAUL'S WIFE,"And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,"
1339,PAUL'S WIFE,"Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom,"
1340,PAUL'S WIFE,"It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,"
1341,PAUL'S WIFE,"Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,"
1342,PAUL'S WIFE,"Who, leaning on a log looked back at Paul."
1343,PAUL'S WIFE,And that made Paul in turn look back
1344,PAUL'S WIFE,To see if it was anyone behind him
1345,PAUL'S WIFE,That she was looking at instead of him.
1346,PAUL'S WIFE,"Murphy had been there watching all the time,"
1347,PAUL'S WIFE,But from a shed where neither of them could see him.
1348,PAUL'S WIFE,There was a moment of suspense in birth
1349,PAUL'S WIFE,"When the girl seemed too water-logged to live,"
1350,PAUL'S WIFE,Before she caught her first breath with a gasp
1351,PAUL'S WIFE,"And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,"
1352,PAUL'S WIFE,And walked off talking to herself or Paul
1353,PAUL'S WIFE,"Across the logs like backs of alligators,"
1354,PAUL'S WIFE,Paul taking after her around the pond.
1355,PAUL'S WIFE,
1356,PAUL'S WIFE,Next evening Murphy and some other fellows
1357,PAUL'S WIFE,"Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,"
1358,PAUL'S WIFE,From the bare top of which there is a view
1359,PAUL'S WIFE,To other hills across a kettle valley.
1360,PAUL'S WIFE,"And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,"
1361,PAUL'S WIFE,They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.
1362,PAUL'S WIFE,It was the only glimpse that anyone
1363,PAUL'S WIFE,Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them
1364,PAUL'S WIFE,Falling in love across the twilight mill-pond.
1365,PAUL'S WIFE,More than a mile across the wilderness
1366,PAUL'S WIFE,They sat together half-way up a cliff
1367,PAUL'S WIFE,"In a small niche let into it, the girl"
1368,PAUL'S WIFE,"Brightly, as if a star played on the place,"
1369,PAUL'S WIFE,"Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light"
1370,PAUL'S WIFE,"Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star,"
1371,PAUL'S WIFE,As was apparent from what happened next.
1372,PAUL'S WIFE,"All those great ruffians put their throats together,"
1373,PAUL'S WIFE,"And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,"
1374,PAUL'S WIFE,As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.
1375,PAUL'S WIFE,"Of course the bottle fell short by a mile,"
1376,PAUL'S WIFE,But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.
1377,PAUL'S WIFE,"She went out like a firefly, and that was all."
1378,PAUL'S WIFE,
1379,PAUL'S WIFE,"So there were witnesses that Paul was married,"
1380,PAUL'S WIFE,And not to anyone to be ashamed of.
1381,PAUL'S WIFE,Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul.
1382,PAUL'S WIFE,Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs
1383,PAUL'S WIFE,About his wife to keep her to himself.
1384,PAUL'S WIFE,Paul was what's called a terrible possessor.
1385,PAUL'S WIFE,Owning a wife with him meant owning her.
1386,PAUL'S WIFE,"She wasn't anybody else's business,"
1387,PAUL'S WIFE,"Either to praise her, or so much as name her,"
1388,PAUL'S WIFE,And he'd thank people not to think of her.
1389,PAUL'S WIFE,Murphy's idea was that a man like Paul
1390,PAUL'S WIFE,Wouldn't be spoken to about a wife
1391,PAUL'S WIFE,In any way the world knew how to speak.
1392,PAUL'S WIFE,

1396,WILD GRAPES,WILD GRAPES
1397,WILD GRAPES,
1398,WILD GRAPES,
1399,WILD GRAPES,What tree may not the fig be gathered from?
1400,WILD GRAPES,The grape may not be gathered from the birch?
1401,WILD GRAPES,"It's all you know the grape, or know the birch."
1402,WILD GRAPES,As a girl gathered from the birch myself
1403,WILD GRAPES,"Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn,"
1404,WILD GRAPES,I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.
1405,WILD GRAPES,"I was born, I suppose, like anyone,"
1406,WILD GRAPES,And grew to be a little boyish girl
1407,WILD GRAPES,My brother could not always leave at home.
1408,WILD GRAPES,But that beginning was wiped out in fear
1409,WILD GRAPES,"The day I swung suspended with the grapes,"
1410,WILD GRAPES,And was come after like Eurydice
1411,WILD GRAPES,And brought down safely from the upper regions;
1412,WILD GRAPES,And the life I live now's an extra life
1413,WILD GRAPES,I can waste as I please on whom I please.
1414,WILD GRAPES,"So if you see me celebrate two birthdays,"
1415,WILD GRAPES,"And give myself out as two different ages,"
1416,WILD GRAPES,One of them five years younger than I look--
1417,WILD GRAPES,
1418,WILD GRAPES,One day my brother led me to a glade
1419,WILD GRAPES,"Where a white birch he knew of stood alone,"
1420,WILD GRAPES,"Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,"
1421,WILD GRAPES,"And heavy on her heavy hair behind,"
1422,WILD GRAPES,"Against her neck, an ornament of grapes."
1423,WILD GRAPES,"Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year."
1424,WILD GRAPES,"One bunch of them, and there began to be"
1425,WILD GRAPES,"Bunches all round me growing in white birches,"
1426,WILD GRAPES,The way they grew round Lief the Lucky's German;
1427,WILD GRAPES,"Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,"
1428,WILD GRAPES,"As the moon used to seem when I was younger,"
1429,WILD GRAPES,And only freely to be had for climbing.
1430,WILD GRAPES,My brother did the climbing; and at first
1431,WILD GRAPES,Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter
1432,WILD GRAPES,And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;
1433,WILD GRAPES,"Which gave him some time to himself to eat,"
1434,WILD GRAPES,"But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed."
1435,WILD GRAPES,"So then, to make me wholly self-supporting,"
1436,WILD GRAPES,"He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth,"
1437,WILD GRAPES,And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.
1438,WILD GRAPES,"""Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another."
1439,WILD GRAPES,"Hold on with all your might when I let go."""
1440,WILD GRAPES,I said I had the tree. It wasn't true.
1441,WILD GRAPES,The opposite was true. The tree had me.
1442,WILD GRAPES,The minute it was left with me alone
1443,WILD GRAPES,It caught me up as if I were the fish
1444,WILD GRAPES,And it the fishpole. So I was translated
1445,WILD GRAPES,"To loud cries from my brother of ""Let go!"
1446,WILD GRAPES,"Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!"""
1447,WILD GRAPES,"But I, with something of the baby grip"
1448,WILD GRAPES,Acquired ancestrally in just such trees
1449,WILD GRAPES,When wilder mothers than our wildest now
1450,WILD GRAPES,Hung babies out on branches by the hands
1451,WILD GRAPES,"To dry or wash or tan, I don't know which"
1452,WILD GRAPES,(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)--
1453,WILD GRAPES,I held on uncomplainingly for life.
1454,WILD GRAPES,My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.
1455,WILD GRAPES,"""What are you doing up there in those grapes?"
1456,WILD GRAPES,Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.
1457,WILD GRAPES,"I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them."""
1458,WILD GRAPES,Much danger of my picking anything!
1459,WILD GRAPES,
1460,WILD GRAPES,By that time I was pretty well reduced
1461,WILD GRAPES,To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.
1462,WILD GRAPES,"""Now you know how it feels,"" my brother said,"
1463,WILD GRAPES,"""To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,"
1464,WILD GRAPES,That when it thinks it has escaped the fox
1465,WILD GRAPES,"By growing where it shouldn't--on a birch,"
1466,WILD GRAPES,Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it--
1467,WILD GRAPES,"And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it--"
1468,WILD GRAPES,Just then come you and I to gather it.
1469,WILD GRAPES,Only you have the advantage of the grapes
1470,WILD GRAPES,"In one way: you have one more stem to cling by,"
1471,WILD GRAPES,"And promise more resistance to the picker."""
1472,WILD GRAPES,
1473,WILD GRAPES,"One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,"
1474,WILD GRAPES,"And still I clung. I let my head fall back,"
1475,WILD GRAPES,"And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears"
1476,WILD GRAPES,"Against my brother's nonsense; ""Drop,"" he said,"
1477,WILD GRAPES,"""I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far."""
1478,WILD GRAPES,(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)
1479,WILD GRAPES,"""Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down."""
1480,WILD GRAPES,"Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,"
1481,WILD GRAPES,My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.
1482,WILD GRAPES,"""Why, if she isn't serious about it!"
1483,WILD GRAPES,Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.
1484,WILD GRAPES,"I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it."""
1485,WILD GRAPES,I don't know much about the letting down;
1486,WILD GRAPES,But once I felt ground with my stocking feet
1487,WILD GRAPES,"And the world came revolving back to me,"
1488,WILD GRAPES,"I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,"
1489,WILD GRAPES,Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.
1490,WILD GRAPES,"My brother said: ""Don't you weigh anything?"
1491,WILD GRAPES,"Try to weigh something next time, so you won't"
1492,WILD GRAPES,"Be run off with by birch trees into space."""
1493,WILD GRAPES,
1494,WILD GRAPES,It wasn't my not weighing anything
1495,WILD GRAPES,So much as my not knowing anything--
1496,WILD GRAPES,My brother had been nearer right before.
1497,WILD GRAPES,I had not taken the first step in knowledge;
1498,WILD GRAPES,"I had not learned to let go with the hands,"
1499,WILD GRAPES,"As still I have not learned to with the heart,"
1500,WILD GRAPES,"And have no wish to with the heart--nor need,"
1501,WILD GRAPES,That I can see. The mind--is not the heart.
1502,WILD GRAPES,"I may yet live, as I know others live,"
1503,WILD GRAPES,To wish in vain to let go with the mind--
1504,WILD GRAPES,"Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me"
1505,WILD GRAPES,That I need learn to let go with the heart.

1513,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Nothing to say to all those marriages!
1514,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She had made three herself to three of his.
1515,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"The score was even for them, three to three."
1516,PLACE FOR A THIRD,But come to die she found she cared so much:
1517,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She thought of children in a burial row;
1518,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Three children in a burial row were sad.
1519,PLACE FOR A THIRD,One man's three women in a burial row
1520,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Somehow made her impatient with the man.
1521,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"And so she said to Laban, ""You have done"
1522,PLACE FOR A THIRD,A good deal right; don't do the last thing wrong.
1523,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Don't make me lie with those two other women."""
1524,PLACE FOR A THIRD,
1525,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Laban said, No, he would not make her lie"
1526,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"With anyone but that she had a mind to,"
1527,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"If that was how she felt, of course, he said."
1528,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She went her way. But Laban having caught
1529,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza,"
1530,PLACE FOR A THIRD,And anxious to make all he could of it
1531,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"With something he remembered in himself,"
1532,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Tried to think how he could exceed his promise,"
1533,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"And give good measure to the dead, though thankless."
1534,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"If that was how she felt, he kept repeating."
1535,PLACE FOR A THIRD,His first thought under pressure was a grave
1536,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"In a new boughten grave plot by herself,"
1537,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Under he didn't care how great a stone:
1538,PLACE FOR A THIRD,He'd sell a yoke of steers to pay for it.
1539,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"And weren't there special cemetery flowers,"
1540,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest:"
1541,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"The flowers will go on with grief awhile,"
1542,PLACE FOR A THIRD,And no one seem neglecting or neglected?
1543,PLACE FOR A THIRD,A prudent grief will not despise such aids.
1544,PLACE FOR A THIRD,He thought of evergreen and everlasting.
1545,PLACE FOR A THIRD,And then he had a thought worth many of these.
1546,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy
1547,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Who married her for playmate more than helpmate,"
1548,PLACE FOR A THIRD,And sometimes laughed at what it was between them.
1549,PLACE FOR A THIRD,How would she like to sleep her last with him?
1550,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name?
1551,PLACE FOR A THIRD,
1552,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"He found the grave a town or two away,"
1553,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"The headstone cut with _John, Beloved Husband_,"
1554,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Beside it room reserved, the say a sister's,"
1555,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"A never-married sister's of that husband,"
1556,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Whether Eliza would be welcome there.
1557,PLACE FOR A THIRD,The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister.
1558,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing"
1559,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Of where Eliza wanted _not_ to lie,"
1560,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"And who had thought to lay her with her first love,"
1561,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Begged simply for the grave. The sister's face
1562,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility.
1563,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She wanted to do right. She'd have to think.
1564,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care;"
1565,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"And she was old and poor--but she cared, too."
1566,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him,"
1567,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Then turned him out to go on other errands
1568,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"She said he might attend to in the village,"
1569,PLACE FOR A THIRD,While she made up her mind how much she cared--
1570,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"And how much Laban cared--and why he cared,"
1571,PLACE FOR A THIRD,(She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.)
1572,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"She'd looked Eliza up her second time,"
1573,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"A widow at her second husband's grave,"
1574,PLACE FOR A THIRD,And offered her a home to rest awhile
1575,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Before she went the poor man's widow's way,"
1576,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock.
1577,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She and Eliza had been friends through all.
1578,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Who was she to judge marriage in a world
1579,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Whose Bible's so confused in marriage counsel?
1580,PLACE FOR A THIRD,The sister had not come across this Laban;
1581,PLACE FOR A THIRD,A decent product of life's ironing-out;
1582,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She must not keep him waiting. Time would press
1583,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Between the death day and the funeral day.
1584,PLACE FOR A THIRD,So when she saw him coming in the street
1585,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She hurried her decision to be ready
1586,PLACE FOR A THIRD,To meet him with his answer at the door.
1587,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Laban had known about what it would be
1588,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"From the way she had set her poor old mouth,"
1589,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"To do, as she had put it, what was right."
1590,PLACE FOR A THIRD,
1591,PLACE FOR A THIRD,She gave it through the screen door closed between them:
1592,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"""No, not with John. There wouldn't be no sense."
1593,PLACE FOR A THIRD,"Eliza's had too many other men."""
1594,PLACE FOR A THIRD,
1595,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Laban was forced to fall back on his plan
1596,PLACE FOR A THIRD,To buy Eliza a plot to lie alone in:
1597,PLACE FOR A THIRD,Which gives him for himself a choice of lots
1598,PLACE FOR A THIRD,When his time comes to die and settle down.

1604,TWO WITCHES,
1605,TWO WITCHES,
1606,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS
1607,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Circa_ 1922
1608,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1609,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I staid the night for shelter at a farm
1610,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Behind the mountain, with a mother and son,"
1611,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Two old-believers. They did all the talking.
1612,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1613,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Mother._ Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits
1614,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"She could call up to pass a winter evening,"
1615,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"But won't, should be burned at the stake or something."
1616,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Summoning spirits isn't ""Button, button,"
1617,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Who's got the button,"" I would have them know."
1618,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1619,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Son._ Mother can make a common table rear
1620,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And kick with two legs like an army mule.
1621,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1622,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"_Mother._ And when I've done it, what good have I done?"
1623,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Rather than tip a table for you, let me"
1624,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me.
1625,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him"
1626,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"How could that be--I thought the dead were souls,"
1627,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious
1628,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,That there's something the dead are keeping back?
1629,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back."
1630,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1631,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Son._ You wouldn't want to tell him what we have
1632,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Up attic, mother?"
1633,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1634,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Mother._ Bones--a skeleton.
1635,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1636,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Son._ But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed
1637,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Against the attic door: the door is nailed.
1638,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,It's harmless. Mother hears it in the night
1639,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Halting perplexed behind the barrier
1640,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get
1641,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Is back into the cellar where it came from.
1642,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1643,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"_Mother._ We'll never let them, will we, son? We'll never!"
1644,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1645,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Son._ It left the cellar forty years ago
1646,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And carried itself like a pile of dishes
1647,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen,"
1648,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Another from the kitchen to the bedroom,"
1649,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Another from the bedroom to the attic,"
1650,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped it."
1651,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs.
1652,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I was a baby: I don't know where I was.
1653,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1654,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Mother._ The only fault my husband found with me--
1655,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I went to sleep before I went to bed,"
1656,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Especially in winter when the bed
1657,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.
1658,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs
1659,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,"
1660,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,But left an open door to cool the room off
1661,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,So as to sort of turn me out of it.
1662,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I was just coming to myself enough
1663,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"To wonder where the cold was coming from,"
1664,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom
1665,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.
1666,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on
1667,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,When there was water in the cellar in spring
1668,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone
1669,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,"
1670,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"The way a man with one leg and a crutch,"
1671,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Or a little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:"
1672,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,It wasn't anyone who could be there.
1673,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked
1674,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And swollen tight and buried under snow.
1675,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust
1676,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And swollen tight and buried under snow.
1677,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,It was the bones. I knew them--and good reason.
1678,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,My first impulse was to get to the knob
1679,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And hold the door. But the bones didn't try
1680,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"The door; they halted helpless on the landing,"
1681,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Waiting for things to happen in their favor.
1682,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.
1683,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I never could have done the thing I did
1684,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,If the wish hadn't been too strong in me
1685,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,To see how they were mounted for this walk.
1686,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I had a vision of them put together
1687,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Not like a man, but like a chandelier."
1688,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.
1689,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"A moment he stood balancing with emotion,"
1690,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire
1691,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.
1692,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)
1693,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,"
1694,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The way he did in life once; but this time
1695,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,"
1696,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And fell back from him on the floor myself.
1697,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The finger-pieces slid in all directions.
1698,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?
1699,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Hand me my button-box--it must be there.)
1700,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I sat up on the floor and shouted, ""Toffile,"
1701,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"It's coming up to you."" It had its choice"
1702,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Of the door to the cellar or the hall.
1703,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"It took the hall door for the novelty,"
1704,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"And set off briskly for so slow a thing,"
1705,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Still going every which way in the joints, though,"
1706,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,"
1707,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,From the slap I had just now given its hand.
1708,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I listened till it almost climbed the stairs
1709,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"From the hall to the only finished bedroom,"
1710,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Before I got up to do anything;
1711,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Then ran and shouted, ""Shut the bedroom door,"
1712,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile, for my sake!"" ""Company,"" he said,"
1713,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed."""
1714,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,So lying forward weakly on the handrail
1715,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light"
1716,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own
1717,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I could see nothing. ""Toffile, I don't see it."
1718,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"It's with us in the room though. It's the bones."""
1719,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""What bones?"" ""The cellar bones--out of the grave."""
1720,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,That made him throw his bare legs out of bed
1721,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And sit up by me and take hold of me.
1722,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I wanted to put out the light and see
1723,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"If I could see it, or else mow the room,"
1724,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"With our arms at the level of our knees,"
1725,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"And bring the chalk-pile down. ""I'll tell you what--"
1726,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,It's looking for another door to try.
1727,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The uncommonly deep snow has made him think
1728,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Of his old song, _The Wild Colonial Boy_,"
1729,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,He always used to sing along the tote-road.
1730,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,He's after an open door to get out-doors.
1731,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Let's trap him with an open door up attic."""
1732,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,"
1733,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Almost the moment he was given an opening,"
1734,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The steps began to climb the attic stairs.
1735,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.
1736,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""Quick!"" I slammed to the door and held the knob."
1737,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""Toffile, get nails."" I made him nail the door shut,"
1738,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,And push the headboard of the bed against it.
1739,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Then we asked was there anything
1740,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Up attic that we'd ever want again.
1741,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The attic was less to us than the cellar.
1742,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"If the bones liked the attic, let them have it,"
1743,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes
1744,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed
1745,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Behind the door and headboard of the bed,"
1746,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,"
1747,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,"
1748,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,That's what I sit up in the dark to say--
1749,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,To no one any more since Toffile died.
1750,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Let them stay in the attic since they went there.
1751,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I promised Toffile to be cruel to them
1752,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,For helping them be cruel once to him.
1753,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1754,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Son._ We think they had a grave down in the cellar.
1755,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1756,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Mother._ We know they had a grave down in the cellar.
1757,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1758,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Son._ We never could find out whose bones they were.
1759,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1760,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"_Mother._ Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once."
1761,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,They were a man's his father killed for me.
1762,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I mean a man he killed instead of me.
1763,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The least I could do was to help dig their grave.
1764,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,We were about it one night in the cellar.
1765,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him
1766,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"To tell the truth, suppose the time had come."
1767,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Son looks surprised to see me end a lie
1768,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,We'd kept all these years between ourselves
1769,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,So as to have it ready for outsiders.
1770,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,But tonight I don't care enough to lie--
1771,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I don't remember why I ever cared.
1772,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe"
1773,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Could tell you why he ever cared himself . . .
1774,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1775,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted
1776,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,Among the buttons poured out in her lap.
1777,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,I verified the name next morning: Toffile.
1778,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,The rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway.
1779,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1780,I. THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1781,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON
1782,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,
1783,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Now that they've got it settled whose I be,"
1784,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I'm going to tell them something they won't like:
1785,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"They've got it settled wrong, and I can prove it."
1786,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting
1787,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To make a present of me to each other.
1788,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"They don't dispose me, either one of them,"
1789,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To spare them any trouble. Double trouble's
1790,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Always the witch's motto anyway.
1791,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I'll double theirs for both of them--you watch me.
1792,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"They'll find they've got the whole thing to do over,"
1793,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"That is, if facts is what they want to go by."
1794,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,They set a lot (now don't they?) by a record
1795,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Of Arthur Amy's having once been up
1796,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.
1797,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I could have told them any time this twelvemonth
1798,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,The Arthur Amy I was married to
1799,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Couldn't have been the one they say was up
1800,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,In Warren at March Meeting for the reason
1801,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,He wa'n't but fifteen at the time they say.
1802,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,The Arthur Amy I was married to
1803,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Voted the only times he ever voted,"
1804,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Which wasn't many, in the town of Wentworth."
1805,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,One of the times was when 'twas in the warrant
1806,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To see if the town wanted to take over
1807,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,The tote road to our clearing where we lived.
1808,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I'll tell you who'd remember--Heman Lapish.
1809,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.
1810,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,So now they've dragged it through the law courts once
1811,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I guess they'd better drag it through again.
1812,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Wentworth and Warren's both good towns to live in,"
1813,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Only I happen to prefer to live
1814,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"In Wentworth from now on; and when all's said,"
1815,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Right's right, and the temptation to do right"
1816,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,When I can hurt someone by doing it
1817,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Has always been too much for me, it has."
1818,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I know of some folks that'd be set up
1819,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,At having in their town a noted witch:
1820,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,But most would have to think of the expense
1821,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,That even I would be. They ought to know
1822,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,That as a witch I'd often milk a bat
1823,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,And that'd be enough to last for days.
1824,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"It'd make my position stronger, think,"
1825,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,If I was to consent to give some sign
1826,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To make it surer that I was a witch?
1827,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"It wa'n't no sign, I s'pose, when Mallice Huse"
1828,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Said that I took him out in his old age
1829,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,And rode all over everything on him
1830,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Until I'd had him worn to skin and bones.
1831,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,And if I'd left him hitched unblanketed
1832,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"In front of one Town Hall, I'd left him hitched"
1833,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,In front of every one in Grafton County.
1834,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,"
1835,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,The poor old man. It would have been all right
1836,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,If some one hadn't said to gnaw the posts
1837,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,"
1838,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,So they could recognize them. Not a post
1839,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,That they could hear tell of was scarified.
1840,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.
1841,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Then that same smarty someone said to look--
1842,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,He'd bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed
1843,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,The crib he slept in--and as sure's you're born
1844,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"They found he'd gnawed the four posts of his bed,"
1845,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?
1846,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Not that he hadn't gnawed the hitching posts
1847,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,He said he had besides. Because a horse
1848,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Gnaws in the stable ain't no proof to me
1849,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,He don't gnaw trees and posts and fences too.
1850,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,But everybody took it for a proof.
1851,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I was a strapping girl of twenty then.
1852,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,The smarty someone who spoiled everything
1853,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was.
1854,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,That was the way he started courting me.
1855,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"He never said much after we were married,"
1856,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,But I mistrusted he was none too proud
1857,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Of having interfered in the Huse business.
1858,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I guess he found he got more out of me
1859,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,By having me a witch. Or something happened
1860,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To turn him round. He got to saying things
1861,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"To undo what he'd done and make it right,"
1862,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Like, ""No, she ain't come back from kiting yet."
1863,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Last night was one of her nights out. She's kiting.
1864,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,She thinks when the wind makes a night of it
1865,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"She might as well herself."" But he liked best"
1866,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To let on he was plagued to death with me:
1867,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,If anyone had seen me coming home
1868,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Over the ridgepole, 'stride of a broomstick,"
1869,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"As often as he had in the tail of the night,"
1870,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,He guessed they'd know what he had to put up with.
1871,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough"
1872,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Off from the house as far as we could keep
1873,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,And from barn smells you can't wash out of ploughed ground
1874,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,With all the rain and snow of seven years;
1875,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,And I don't mean just skulls of Roger's Rangers
1876,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,"
1877,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,Only bewitched so I would last him longer.
1878,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,"
1879,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I made him gather me wet snow berries
1880,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,On slippery rocks beside a waterfall.
1881,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I made him do it for me in the dark.
1882,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,And he liked everything I made him do.
1883,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,I hope if he is where he sees me now
1884,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,He's so far off he can't see what I've come to.
1885,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,You _can_ come down from everything to nothing.
1886,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"All is, if I'd a-known when I was young"
1887,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,"And full of it, that this would be the end,"
1888,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,It doesn't seem as if I'd had the courage
1889,II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON,To make so free and kick up in folks' faces.

2596,TWO LOOK AT TWO,A little further up the mountain side
2597,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"With night so near, but not much further up."
2598,TWO LOOK AT TWO,They must have halted soon in any case
2599,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"With thoughts of the path back, how rough it was"
2600,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness;"
2601,TWO LOOK AT TWO,When they were halted by a tumbled wall
2602,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this,"
2603,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Spending what onward impulse they still had
2604,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"In one last look the way they must not go,"
2605,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"On up the failing path, where, if a stone"
2606,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself;"
2607,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"No footstep moved it. ""This is all,"" they sighed,"
2608,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"""Good-night to woods."" But not so; there was more."
2609,TWO LOOK AT TWO,A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
2610,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"Across the wall, as near the wall as they."
2611,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"She saw them in their field, they her in hers."
2612,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"The difficulty of seeing what stood still,"
2613,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"Like some up-ended boulder split in two,"
2614,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Was in her clouded eyes: they saw no fear there.
2615,TWO LOOK AT TWO,She seemed to think that two thus they were safe.
2616,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"Then, as if they were something that, though strange,"
2617,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"She could not trouble her mind with too long,"
2618,TWO LOOK AT TWO,She sighed and passed unscared along the wall.
2619,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"""_This_, then, is all. What more is there to ask?"""
2620,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait."
2621,TWO LOOK AT TWO,A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
2622,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Across the wall as near the wall as they.
2623,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,"
2624,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Not the same doe come back into her place.
2625,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,"
2626,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"As if to ask, ""Why don't you make some motion?"
2627,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Or give some sign of life? Because you can't.
2628,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"I doubt if you're as living as you look."""
2629,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Thus till he had them almost feeling dared
2630,TWO LOOK AT TWO,To stretch a proffering hand--and a spell-breaking.
2631,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Then he too passed unscared along the wall.
2632,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from."
2633,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"""This _must_ be all."" It was all. Still they stood,"
2634,TWO LOOK AT TWO,"A great wave from it going over them,"
2635,TWO LOOK AT TWO,As if the earth in one unlooked-for favor
2636,TWO LOOK AT TWO,Had made them certain earth returned their love.

2647,NOT TO KEEP,"Under the formal writing, he was in her sight,"
2648,NOT TO KEEP,Living. They gave him back to her alive--

2650,NOT TO KEEP,And not disfigured visibly. His face?
2651,NOT TO KEEP,"His hands? She had to look, to ask,"

2653,NOT TO KEEP,And still she had all--_they_ had--they the lucky!
2654,NOT TO KEEP,"Wasn't she glad now? Everything seemed won,"
2655,NOT TO KEEP,And all the rest for them permissible ease.
2656,NOT TO KEEP,"She had to ask, ""What was it, dear?"""

2661,NOT TO KEEP,"Can cure me of to go again."" The same"
2662,NOT TO KEEP,Grim giving to do over for them both.
2663,NOT TO KEEP,She dared no more than ask him with her eyes
2664,NOT TO KEEP,How was it with him for a second trial.

2799,EVENING IN A SUGAR ORCHARD,"On every tree a bucket with a lid,"
2800,EVENING IN A SUGAR ORCHARD,And on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow.
2801,EVENING IN A SUGAR ORCHARD,The sparks made no attempt to be the moon.
2802,EVENING IN A SUGAR ORCHARD,They were content to figure in the trees
2803,EVENING IN A SUGAR ORCHARD,"As Leo, Orion, and the Pleiades."

2849,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,"You made no sound in the grass with your footfall,"
2850,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,"As far as you went from the door, which was not far;"
2851,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,But you had awakened under the morning star
2852,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,The first song-bird that awakened all the rest.
2853,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,He could have slept but a moment more at best.
2854,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,Already determined dawn began to lay
2855,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,In place across a cloud the slender ray
2856,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,"For prying beneath and forcing the lids of sight,"
2857,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,And loosing the pent-up music of over-night.
2858,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,"But dawn was not to begin their ""pearly-pearly"""

2861,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,Neither was song that day to be self-begun.
2862,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,"You had begun it, and if there needed proof--"
2863,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,"I was asleep still under the dripping roof,"
2864,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,My window curtain hung over the sill to wet;
2865,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,But I should awake to confirm your story yet;
2866,THE VALLEY'S SINGING DAY,I should be willing to say and help you say

2899,A HILLSIDE THAW,
2900,A HILLSIDE THAW,
2901,A HILLSIDE THAW,To think to know the country and not know
2902,A HILLSIDE THAW,The hillside on the day the sun lets go
2903,A HILLSIDE THAW,Ten million silver lizards out of snow!
2904,A HILLSIDE THAW,As often as I've seen it done before
2905,A HILLSIDE THAW,I can't pretend to tell the way it's done.
2906,A HILLSIDE THAW,It looks as if some magic of the sun
2907,A HILLSIDE THAW,Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor
2908,A HILLSIDE THAW,And the light breaking on them made them run.
2909,A HILLSIDE THAW,"But if I thought to stop the wet stampede,"
2910,A HILLSIDE THAW,"And caught one silver lizard by the tail,"
2911,A HILLSIDE THAW,"And put my foot on one without avail,"
2912,A HILLSIDE THAW,And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed
2913,A HILLSIDE THAW,"In front of twenty others' wriggling speed,--"
2914,A HILLSIDE THAW,"In the confusion of them all aglitter,"
2915,A HILLSIDE THAW,And birds that joined in the excited fun
2916,A HILLSIDE THAW,"By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,"
2917,A HILLSIDE THAW,I have no doubt I'd end by holding none.
2918,A HILLSIDE THAW,
2919,A HILLSIDE THAW,It takes the moon for this. The sun's a wizard
2920,A HILLSIDE THAW,By all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.
2921,A HILLSIDE THAW,From the high west she makes a gentle cast
2922,A HILLSIDE THAW,"And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,"
2923,A HILLSIDE THAW,She has her spell on every single lizard.
2924,A HILLSIDE THAW,I fancied when I looked at six o'clock
2925,A HILLSIDE THAW,The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.
2926,A HILLSIDE THAW,The moon was waiting for her chill effect.
2927,A HILLSIDE THAW,I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock
2928,A HILLSIDE THAW,"In every lifelike posture of the swarm,"
2929,A HILLSIDE THAW,Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.
2930,A HILLSIDE THAW,Across each other and side by side they lay.
2931,A HILLSIDE THAW,The spell that so could hold them as they were
2932,A HILLSIDE THAW,Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm
2933,A HILLSIDE THAW,"To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir."
2934,A HILLSIDE THAW,"It was the moon's: she held them until day,"
2935,A HILLSIDE THAW,One lizard at the end of every ray.
2936,A HILLSIDE THAW,The thought of my attempting such a stay!

2964,ON A TREE FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD,Debating what to do without an axe.
2965,ON A TREE FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD,
2966,ON A TREE FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD,And yet she knows obstruction is in vain:

2978,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,
2979,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,
2980,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,It snowed in spring on earth so dry and warm
2981,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,The flakes could find no landing place to form.
2982,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold,"
2983,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,And still they failed of any lasting hold.
2984,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,They made no white impression on the black.
2985,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,They disappeared as if earth sent them back.
2986,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Not till from separate flakes they changed at night
2987,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,To almost strips and tapes of ragged white
2988,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed,"
2989,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,And all go back to winter but the road.
2990,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead.
2991,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,The grass lay flattened under one great tread.
2992,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Borne down until the end almost took root,"
2993,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,The rangey bough anticipated fruit
2994,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,With snowballs cupped in every opening bud.
2995,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"The road alone maintained itself in mud,"
2996,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Whatever its secret was of greater heat
2997,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,From inward fires or brush of passing feet.
2998,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,
2999,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,In spring more mortal singers than belong
3000,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,To any one place cover us with song.
3001,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin throng;"
3002,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Some to go further north to Hudson's Bay,"
3003,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Some that have come too far north back away,"
3004,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Really a very few to build and stay.
3005,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Now was seen how these liked belated snow.
3006,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,The fields had nowhere left for them to go;
3007,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,They'd soon exhausted all there was in flying;
3008,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,The trees they'd had enough of with once trying
3009,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,And setting off their heavy powder load.
3010,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,They could find nothing open but the road.
3011,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,So there they let their lives be narrowed in
3012,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,By thousands the bad weather made akin.
3013,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,The road became a channel running flocks
3014,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks.
3015,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,I drove them under foot in bits of flight
3016,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"That kept the ground, almost disputing right"
3017,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Of way with me from apathy of wing,"
3018,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,A talking twitter all they had to sing.
3019,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,A few I must have driven to despair
3020,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Made quick asides, but having done in air"
3021,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,A whir among white branches great and small
3022,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,As in some too much carven marble hall
3023,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Where one false wing beat would have brought down all,"
3024,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover,"
3025,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,To suffer the same driven nightmare over.
3026,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,One such storm in a lifetime couldn't teach them
3027,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,That back behind pursuit it couldn't reach them;
3028,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,None flew behind me to be left alone.
3029,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,
3030,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown"
3031,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,"The country's singing strength thus brought together,"
3032,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,That though repressed and moody with the weather
3033,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,Was none the less there ready to be freed
3034,OUR SINGING STRENGTH,And sing the wildflowers up from root and seed.
