301,PREFACE,
302,PREFACE,
303,PREFACE,Who of us care to be present at the accouchment of the immortal? I
304,PREFACE,think that we so attend who are first to take this book in our hands. A
305,PREFACE,"bold assertion, truly, and one demonstrable only in years remote from"
306,PREFACE,these; and—dust wages no war with dust. But it is one of those things
307,PREFACE,that I should most “like to come back and see.”
308,PREFACE,
309,PREFACE,Because he has lent himself the more innocently to the whispers of his
310,PREFACE,"subconscious daemon, and because he has set those murmurs to purer and"
311,PREFACE,"harder crystal than we others, by so much the longer will the poems of"
312,PREFACE,Clark Ashton Smith endure. Here indeed is loot against the forays of
313,PREFACE,moth and rust. Here we shall find none or little of the sentimental fat
314,PREFACE,with which so much of our literature is larded. Rather shall one in
315,PREFACE,"Imagination’s “misty mid-region,” see elfin rubies burn at his feet,"
316,PREFACE,"witch-fires glow in the nearer cypresses, and feel upon his brow a wind"
317,PREFACE,from the unknown. The brave hunters of fly-specks on Art’s cathedral
318,PREFACE,"windows will find little here for their trouble, and both the stupid"
319,PREFACE,and the over-sophisticated would best stare owlishly and pass by: here
320,PREFACE,are neither kindergartens nor skyscrapers. But let him who is worthy by
321,PREFACE,reason of his clear eye and unjaded heart wander across these borders
322,PREFACE,of beauty and mystery and be glad.

387,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,
388,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,
389,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Omar, within thy scented garden-close,"
390,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,When passed with eventide
391,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The starward incense of the waning rose—
392,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Too fair and dear and precious to abide
393,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,After the glad and golden death of spring—
394,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Omar, thou heardest then,"
395,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Above the world of men,"
396,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"The mournful rumour of an iron wing,"
397,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"The sough and sigh of desolating years,"
398,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Whereof the wind is as the winds that blow
399,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Out of a lonesome land of night and snow,"
400,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Where ancient winter weeps with frozen tears;
401,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And in thy bodeful ears,"
402,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The brief and tiny lisp
403,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Of petals curled and crisp,"
404,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Fallen at Eve in Persia’s mellow clime,"
405,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Was mingled with the mighty sound of time.
406,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,
407,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Omar, thou knewest well"
408,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,How the fair days are sorrowful and strange
409,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,With time’s inexorable mystery
410,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,And terror ineluctable of change:
411,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Upon thine eyes the bleak and bitter spell
412,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Of vision, thou didst see,"
413,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"As in a magic glass,"
414,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The moulded mists and painted shadows pass—
415,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The ghostly pomps we name reality.
416,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And, lo, the level field,"
417,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"With broken fane and throne,"
418,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And dust of old, unfabled cities sown,"
419,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"In unremembering years was made to yield,"
420,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"From out the shards of Pow’r,"
421,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The pillars frail and small
422,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,That lift for capital
423,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The blood-like bubble of the poppy-flow’r;
424,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,And crowns were crumbled for the airy gold
425,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The crocus and the daffodil should hold
426,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,As inalienable dow’r.
427,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Before thy gaze, the sad unvaried green"
428,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"The cypresses like robes funereal wear,"
429,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Was woven on the gradual looms of air,"
430,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,From threadbare silk and tattered sendaline
431,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,That clothed some ancient queen;
432,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And from the spoilt vermilion of her mouth,"
433,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"The myrtles rose, and from her ruined hair,"
434,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,And eyes that held the summer’s ardent drouth
435,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"In blown, forgotten bow’rs;"
436,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And amber limbs and breast,"
437,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Through ancient nights by sleepless love oppressed,"
438,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Or by the iron flight of loveless hours.
439,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,
440,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Knowing the weary wisdom of the years,"
441,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The empty truth of tears;
442,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"The suns of June, that with some great excess"
443,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Of ardour slay the unabiding rose,"
444,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And grey-haired winter, wan and fervourless"
445,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,For whom no flower grows;
446,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Seeing the scarlet and the gold that pales,"
447,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"On Orient snows untrod,"
448,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"In magic morns that grant,"
449,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Across a land of common green and gray,"
450,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,The disenchanted day;
451,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Knowing the iron veils
452,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"And walls of adamant,"
453,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,That ward the flaming verities of God—
454,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Knowing these things, ah, surely thou wert wise,"
455,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"Beneath the warm and thunder-dreaming skies,"
456,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"To kiss on ardent breast and avid mouth,"
457,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Some girl whose sultry eyes
458,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Were golden with the sun-beloved south—
459,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,"To pluck the rose and drain the rose-red wine,"
460,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,In gardens half-divine;
461,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Before the broken cup
462,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,Be filled and covered up
463,TO OMAR KHAYYAM,In dusty seas of everlasting drouth.

469,STRANGENESS,
470,STRANGENESS,
471,STRANGENESS,"O love, thy lips are bright and cold,"
472,STRANGENESS,Like jewels carven curiously
473,STRANGENESS,"To symbols of a mystery,"
474,STRANGENESS,"A secret dim, forgotten, old."
475,STRANGENESS,
476,STRANGENESS,"Like woven amber, finely spun,"
477,STRANGENESS,"Thy hair, enwoofed with golden light,"
478,STRANGENESS,Remembers yet the flaming flight
479,STRANGENESS,"Of some unknown, archaic sun."
480,STRANGENESS,
481,STRANGENESS,"Thine eyes are crystals green and chill,"
482,STRANGENESS,"Wherein, as in a shifting sea,"
483,STRANGENESS,Wan fires and drowning splendours flee
484,STRANGENESS,To stealthy deeps forever still.
485,STRANGENESS,
486,STRANGENESS,"Fallen across thy dreaming face,"

1792,SYMBOLS,"The god himself, who calls the fleeing clouds"
1793,SYMBOLS,"Into the nave where suns might congregate,"
1794,SYMBOLS,And veils the darkling mountain of his face
1795,SYMBOLS,With fold on solemn fold; for whom the priests
1796,SYMBOLS,Amass their monthly hecatomb of gems—
1797,SYMBOLS,"Opals that are a camel-cumbering load,"
1798,SYMBOLS,"And monstrous alabraundines, won from war"
1799,SYMBOLS,"With realms of hostile serpents; which arise,"
1800,SYMBOLS,"Combustible, in vapours many-hued,"
1801,SYMBOLS,"And myrrh-excelling perfumes. It is I,"
1802,SYMBOLS,"The king, who holds with scepter-dropping hand"
1803,SYMBOLS,"The helm of some great barge of chrysolite,"
1804,SYMBOLS,Sailing upon an amethystine sea
1805,SYMBOLS,To isles of timeless summer: For the snows
1806,SYMBOLS,"Of hyperborean winter, and their winds,"
1807,SYMBOLS,"Sleep in his jewel-builded capital,"
1808,SYMBOLS,"Nor any charm of flame-wrought wizardry,"
1809,SYMBOLS,"Nor conjured suns may rout them; so he flees,"
1810,SYMBOLS,"With captive kings to urge his serried oars,"
1811,SYMBOLS,Hopeful of dales where amaranthine dawn
1812,SYMBOLS,Hath never left the faintly sighing lote
1813,SYMBOLS,"And fields of lisping moly. Or I fare,"
1814,SYMBOLS,"Impanoplied with azure diamond,"
1815,SYMBOLS,"As hero of a quest Achernar lights,"
1816,SYMBOLS,"To deserts filled with ever-wandering flames,"
1817,SYMBOLS,"That feed upon the sullen marl, and soar"
1818,SYMBOLS,"To wrap the slopes of mountains, and to leap,"
1819,SYMBOLS,"With tongues intolerably lengthening,"
1820,SYMBOLS,That lick the blenchèd heavens. But there lives
1821,SYMBOLS,(Secure as in a garden walled from wind)
1822,SYMBOLS,"A lonely flower by a placid well,"
1823,SYMBOLS,"Midmost the flaring tumult of the flames,"
1824,SYMBOLS,"That roar as roars the storm-possessèd sea,"
1825,SYMBOLS,Implacable forever: And within
1826,SYMBOLS,"That simple grail the blossom lifts, there lies"
1827,SYMBOLS,"One drop of an incomparable dew,"
1828,SYMBOLS,"Which heals the parchèd weariness of kings,"
1829,SYMBOLS,And cures the wound of wisdom. I am page
1830,SYMBOLS,"To an emperor who reigns ten thousand years,"
1831,SYMBOLS,"And through his labyrinthine palace-rooms,"
1832,SYMBOLS,Through courts and colonnades and balconies
1833,SYMBOLS,"Wherein immensity itself is mazed,"
1834,SYMBOLS,"I seek the golden gorget he hath lost,"
1835,SYMBOLS,On which the names of his conniving stars
1836,SYMBOLS,Are writ in little sapphires; and I roam
1837,SYMBOLS,"For centuries, and hear the brazen clocks"
1838,SYMBOLS,Innumerably clang with such a sound
1839,SYMBOLS,"As brazen hammers make, by devils dinned"
1840,SYMBOLS,On tombs of all the dead; and nevermore
1841,SYMBOLS,"I find the gorget, but at length I find"
1842,SYMBOLS,A sealèd room whose nameless prisoner
1843,SYMBOLS,"Moans with a nameless torture, and would turn"
1844,SYMBOLS,To hell’s red rack as to a lilied couch
1845,SYMBOLS,"From that whereon they stretched him; and I find,"
1846,SYMBOLS,"Prostrate upon a lotus-painted floor,"
1847,SYMBOLS,The loveliest of all beloved slaves
1848,SYMBOLS,"My emperor hath, and from her pulseless side"
1849,SYMBOLS,"A serpent rises, whiter than the root"
1850,SYMBOLS,"Of some venefic bloom in darkness grown,"
1851,SYMBOLS,And gazes up with green-lit eyes that seem
1852,SYMBOLS,"Like drops of cold, congealing poison.***"
1853,SYMBOLS,
1854,SYMBOLS,Hark!
1855,SYMBOLS,"What word was whispered in a tongue unknown,"
1856,SYMBOLS,In crypts of some impenetrable world?
1857,SYMBOLS,"Whose is the dark, dethroning secrecy"
1858,SYMBOLS,"I cannot share, though I am king of suns"
1859,SYMBOLS,"And king therewith of strong eternity,"
1860,SYMBOLS,Whose gnomons with their swords of shadow guard
1861,SYMBOLS,"My gates, and slay the intruder? Silence loads"
1862,SYMBOLS,"The wind of ether, and the worlds are still"
1863,SYMBOLS,To hear the word that flees me. All my dreams
1864,SYMBOLS,Fall like a rack of fuming vapours raised
1865,SYMBOLS,"To semblance by a necromant, and leave"
1866,SYMBOLS,"Spirit and sense unthinkably alone,"
1867,SYMBOLS,"Above a universe of shrouded stars,"
1868,SYMBOLS,"And suns that wander, cowled with sullen gloom,"
1869,SYMBOLS,Like witches to a Sabbath.*** Fear is born
1870,SYMBOLS,"In crypts below the nadir, and hath crawled"
1871,SYMBOLS,Reaching the floor of space and waits for wings
1872,SYMBOLS,"To lift it upward, like a hellish worm"
1873,SYMBOLS,"Fain for the flesh of seraphs. Eyes that gleam,"
1874,SYMBOLS,"But are not eyes of suns or galaxies,"
1875,SYMBOLS,Gather and throng to the base of darkness; flame
1876,SYMBOLS,"Behind some black, abysmal curtain burns,"
1877,SYMBOLS,"Implacable, and fanned to whitest wrath"
1878,SYMBOLS,"By raisèd wings that flail the whiffled gloom,"
1879,SYMBOLS,"And make a brief and broken wind that moans,"
1880,SYMBOLS,As one who rides a throbbing rack. There is
1881,SYMBOLS,"A Thing that crouches, worlds and years remote,"
1882,SYMBOLS,"Whose horns a demon sharpens, rasping forth"
1883,SYMBOLS,"A note to shatter the donjon-keeps of time,"
1884,SYMBOLS,And crack the sphere of crystal.*** All is dark
1885,SYMBOLS,"For ages, and my tolling heart suspends"
1886,SYMBOLS,"Its clamour, as within the clutch of death,"
1887,SYMBOLS,"Tightening with tense, hermetic rigours. Then,"
1888,SYMBOLS,"In one enormous, million-flashing flame,"
1889,SYMBOLS,"The stars unveil, the suns remove their cowls,"
1890,SYMBOLS,And beam to their responding planets; time
1891,SYMBOLS,"Is mine once more, and armies of its dreams"
1892,SYMBOLS,"Rally to that insuperable throne,"
1893,SYMBOLS,Firmed on the central zenith.
1894,SYMBOLS,
1895,SYMBOLS,Now I seek
1896,SYMBOLS,The meads of shining moly I had found
1897,SYMBOLS,"In some remoter vision, by a stream"
1898,SYMBOLS,"No cloud hath ever tarnished; where the sun,"
1899,SYMBOLS,"A gold Narcissus, loiters evermore"
1900,SYMBOLS,Above his golden image: But I find
1901,SYMBOLS,"A corpse the ebbing water will not keep,"
1902,SYMBOLS,"With eyes like sapphires that have lain in hell,"
1903,SYMBOLS,And felt the hissing embers; and the flow’rs
1904,SYMBOLS,"About me turn to hooded serpents, swayed"
1905,SYMBOLS,"By flutes of devils in a hellish dance,"
1906,SYMBOLS,"Meet for the nod of Satan, when he reigns"
1907,SYMBOLS,"Above the raging Sabbath, and is wooed"
1908,SYMBOLS,By sarabands of witches. But I turn
1909,SYMBOLS,To mountains guarding with their horns of snow
1910,SYMBOLS,"The source of that befoulèd rill, and seek"
1911,SYMBOLS,"A pinnacle where none but eagles climb,"
1912,SYMBOLS,And they with failing pennons. But in vain
1913,SYMBOLS,"I flee, for on that pylon of the sky,"
1914,SYMBOLS,Some curse hath turned the unprinted snow to flame—
1915,SYMBOLS,"Red fires that curl and cluster to my tread,"
1916,SYMBOLS,"Trying the summit’s narrow cirque. And now,"
1917,SYMBOLS,I see a silver python far beneath—
1918,SYMBOLS,"Vast as a river that a fiend hath witched,"
1919,SYMBOLS,And forced to flow remèant in its course
1920,SYMBOLS,To fountains whence it issued. Rapidly
1921,SYMBOLS,"It winds from slope to crumbling slope, and fills"
1922,SYMBOLS,"Ravines and chasmal gorges, till the crags"
1923,SYMBOLS,Totter with coil on coil incumbent. Soon
1924,SYMBOLS,"It hath entwined the pinnacle I keep,"
1925,SYMBOLS,"And gapes with a fanged, unfathomable maw,"
1926,SYMBOLS,"Wherein great Typhon, and Enceladus,"
1927,SYMBOLS,"Were orts of daily glut. But I am gone,"
1928,SYMBOLS,"For at my call a hippogriff hath come,"
1929,SYMBOLS,"And firm between his thunder-beating wings,"
1930,SYMBOLS,"I mount the sheer cerulean walls of noon,"
1931,SYMBOLS,"And see the earth, a spurnèd pebble, fall"
1932,SYMBOLS,Lost in the fields of nether stars—and seek
1933,SYMBOLS,A planet where the outwearied wings of time
1934,SYMBOLS,"Might pause and furl for respite, or the plumes"
1935,SYMBOLS,"Of death be stayed, and loiter in reprieve"
1936,SYMBOLS,"Above some deathless lily: For therein,"
1937,SYMBOLS,Beauty hath found an avatar of flow’rs—
1938,SYMBOLS,"Blossoms that clothe it as a coloured flame,"
1939,SYMBOLS,"From peak to peak, from pole to sullen pole,"
1940,SYMBOLS,And turn the skies to perfume. There I find
1941,SYMBOLS,"A lonely castle, calm and unbeset,"
1942,SYMBOLS,"Save by the purple spears of amaranth,"
1943,SYMBOLS,And tender-sworded iris. Walls upbuilt
1944,SYMBOLS,"Of flushèd marble, wonderful with rose,"
1945,SYMBOLS,"And domes like golden bubbles, and minarets"
1946,SYMBOLS,"That take the clouds as coronal—these are mine,"
1947,SYMBOLS,"For voiceless looms the peaceful barbican,"
1948,SYMBOLS,And the heavy-teethed portcullis hangs aloft
1949,SYMBOLS,As if to smile a welcome. So I leave
1950,SYMBOLS,"My hippogriff to crop the magic meads,"
1951,SYMBOLS,"And pass into a court the lilies hold,"
1952,SYMBOLS,And tread them to a fragrance that pursues
1953,SYMBOLS,"To win the portico, whose columns, carved"
1954,SYMBOLS,"Of lazuli and amber, mock the palms"
1955,SYMBOLS,"Of bright, Aidennic forests—capitalled"
1956,SYMBOLS,"With fronds of stone fretted to airy lace,"
1957,SYMBOLS,Enfolding drupes that seem as tawny clusters
1958,SYMBOLS,Of breasts of unknown houris; and convolved
1959,SYMBOLS,"With vines of shut and shadowy-leavèd flow’rs,"
1960,SYMBOLS,Like the dropt lids of women that endure
1961,SYMBOLS,Some loin-dissolving rapture. Through a door
1962,SYMBOLS,"Enlaid with lilies twined luxuriously,"
1963,SYMBOLS,"I enter, dazed and blinded with the sun,"
1964,SYMBOLS,"And hear, in gloom that changing colours cloud,"
1965,SYMBOLS,"A chuckle sharp as crepitating ice,"
1966,SYMBOLS,Upheaved and cloven by shoulders of the damned
1967,SYMBOLS,Who strive in Antenora. When my eyes
1968,SYMBOLS,"Undazzle, and the cloud of colour fades,"
1969,SYMBOLS,"I find me in a monster-guarded room,"
1970,SYMBOLS,Where marble apes with wings of griffins crowd
1971,SYMBOLS,"On walls an evil sculptor wrought, and beasts"
1972,SYMBOLS,"Wherein the sloth and vampire-bat unite,"
1973,SYMBOLS,"Pendulous by their toes of tarnished bronze,"
1974,SYMBOLS,Usurp the shadowy interval of lamps
1975,SYMBOLS,"That hang from ebon arches. Like a ripple,"
1976,SYMBOLS,Borne by the wind from pool to sluggish pool
1977,SYMBOLS,"In fields where wide Cocytus flows his bound,"
1978,SYMBOLS,"A crackling smile around that circle runs,"
1979,SYMBOLS,And all the stone-wrought gibbons stare at me
1980,SYMBOLS,With eyes that turn to glowing coals. A fear
1981,SYMBOLS,"That found no name in Babel, flings me on,"
1982,SYMBOLS,"Breathless and faint with horror, to a hall"
1983,SYMBOLS,"Within whose weary, self-reverting round,"
1984,SYMBOLS,"The languid curtains, heavier than palls,"
1985,SYMBOLS,"Unnumerably depict a weary king,"
1986,SYMBOLS,Who fain would cool his jewel-crusted hands
1987,SYMBOLS,"In lakes of emerald evening, or the fields"
1988,SYMBOLS,Of dreamless poppies pure with rain. I flee
1989,SYMBOLS,"Onward, and all the shadowy curtains shake"
1990,SYMBOLS,"With tremors of a silken-sighing mirth,"
1991,SYMBOLS,"And whispers of the innumerable king,"
1992,SYMBOLS,"Breathing a tale of ancient pestilence,"
1993,SYMBOLS,Whose very words are vile contagion. Then
1994,SYMBOLS,"I reach a room where caryatids,"
1995,SYMBOLS,"Carved in the form of tall, voluptuous Titan women,"
1996,SYMBOLS,Surround a throne of flowering ebony
1997,SYMBOLS,"Where creeps a vine of crystal. On the throne,"
1998,SYMBOLS,"There lolls a wan, enormous Worm, whose bulk,"
1999,SYMBOLS,"Tumid with all the rottenness of kings,"
2000,SYMBOLS,O’erflows its arms with fold on creasèd fold
2001,SYMBOLS,Of fat obscenely bloating. Open-mouthed
2002,SYMBOLS,"He leans, and from his throat a score of tongues,"
2003,SYMBOLS,"Depending like to wreaths of torpid vipers,"
2004,SYMBOLS,"Drivel with phosphorescent slime, that runs"
2005,SYMBOLS,"Down all his length of soft and monstrous folds,"
2006,SYMBOLS,"And creeping among the flow’rs of ebony,"
2007,SYMBOLS,"Lends them the life of tiny serpents. Now,"
2008,SYMBOLS,Ere the Horror ope those red and lashless slits
2009,SYMBOLS,"Of eyes that draw the gnat and midge, I turn,"
2010,SYMBOLS,"And follow down a dusty hall, whose gloom,"
2011,SYMBOLS,"Lined by the statues with their mighty limbs,"
2012,SYMBOLS,Ends in a golden-roofed balcony
2013,SYMBOLS,Sphering the flowered horizon.
2014,SYMBOLS,Ere my heart
2015,SYMBOLS,"Hath hushed the panic tumult of its pulses,"
2016,SYMBOLS,"I listen, from beyond the horizon’s rim,"
2017,SYMBOLS,"A mutter faint as when the far simoon,"
2018,SYMBOLS,"Mounting from unknown deserts, opens forth,"
2019,SYMBOLS,"Wide as the waste, those wings of torrid night"
2020,SYMBOLS,"That fling the doom of cities from their folds,"
2021,SYMBOLS,"And musters in its van a thousand winds,"
2022,SYMBOLS,"That with disrooted palms for besoms, rise"
2023,SYMBOLS,"And sweep the sands to fury. As the storm,"
2024,SYMBOLS,"Approaching, mounts and loudens to the ears"
2025,SYMBOLS,"Of them that toil in fields of sesame,"
2026,SYMBOLS,"So grows the mutter, and a shadow creeps"
2027,SYMBOLS,"Above the gold horizon, like a dawn"
2028,SYMBOLS,"Of darkness climbing sunward. Now they come,"
2029,SYMBOLS,"A Sabbath of abominable shapes,"
2030,SYMBOLS,Led by the fiends and lamiae of worlds
2031,SYMBOLS,"That owned my sway aforetime! Cockatrice,"
2032,SYMBOLS,"Python, tragelaphus, leviathan,"
2033,SYMBOLS,"Chimera, martichoras, behemoth,"
2034,SYMBOLS,"Geryon and sphinx, and hydra, on my ken"
2035,SYMBOLS,"Arise as might some Afrite-builded city,"
2036,SYMBOLS,"Consummate in the lifting of a lash,"
2037,SYMBOLS,"With thundrous domes and sounding obelisks,"
2038,SYMBOLS,And towers of night and fire alternate! Wings
2039,SYMBOLS,"Of white-hot stone along the hissing wind,"
2040,SYMBOLS,Bear up the huge and furnace-hearted beasts
2041,SYMBOLS,Of hells beyond Rutilicus; and things
2042,SYMBOLS,Whose lightless length would mete the gyre of moons—
2043,SYMBOLS,"Born from the caverns of a dying sun,"
2044,SYMBOLS,"Uncoil to the very zenith, half disclosed"
2045,SYMBOLS,From gulfs below the horizon; octopi
2046,SYMBOLS,"Like blazing moons with countless arms of fire,"
2047,SYMBOLS,Climb from the seas of ever-surging flame
2048,SYMBOLS,"That roll and roar through planets unconsumed,"
2049,SYMBOLS,Beating on coasts of unknown metals; beasts
2050,SYMBOLS,"That range the mighty worlds of Alioth, rise,"
2051,SYMBOLS,"Aforesting the heavens with multitudinous horns,"
2052,SYMBOLS,Within whose maze the winds are lost; and borne
2053,SYMBOLS,"On cliff-like brows of plunging scolopendras,"
2054,SYMBOLS,"The shell-wrought tow’rs of ocean-witches loom,"
2055,SYMBOLS,"And griffin-mounted gods, and demons throned"
2056,SYMBOLS,"On sable dragons, and the cockodrills"
2057,SYMBOLS,That bear the spleenful pygmies on their backs;
2058,SYMBOLS,"And blue-faced wizards from the worlds of Saiph,"
2059,SYMBOLS,On whom Titanic scorpions fawn; and armies
2060,SYMBOLS,"That move with fronts reverted from the foe,"
2061,SYMBOLS,And strike athwart their shoulders at the shapes
2062,SYMBOLS,Their shields reflect in crystal; and eidola
2063,SYMBOLS,Fashioned within unfathomable caves
2064,SYMBOLS,By hands of eyeless peoples; and the blind
2065,SYMBOLS,"And worm-shaped monsters of a sunless world,"
2066,SYMBOLS,"With krakens from the ultimate abyss,"
2067,SYMBOLS,"And Demogorgons of the outer dark,"
2068,SYMBOLS,"Arising, shout with multitudinous thunders,"
2069,SYMBOLS,And threatening me with dooms ineffable
2070,SYMBOLS,"In words whereat the heavens leap to flame,"
2071,SYMBOLS,"Advance on the magic palace! Thrown before,"
2072,SYMBOLS,"For league on league, their blasting shadows blight"
2073,SYMBOLS,"And eat like fire the amaranthine meads,"
2074,SYMBOLS,"Leaving an ashen desert! In the palace,"
2075,SYMBOLS,I hear the apes of marble shriek and howl.
2076,SYMBOLS,"And all the women-shapen columns moan,"
2077,SYMBOLS,"Babbling with unknown terror. In my fear,"
2078,SYMBOLS,"A monstrous dread unnamed in any hell,"
2079,SYMBOLS,"I rise, and flee with the fleeing wind for wings,"
2080,SYMBOLS,"And in a trice the magic palace reels,"
2081,SYMBOLS,"And spiring to a single tow’r of flame,"
2082,SYMBOLS,"Goes out, and leaves nor shard nor ember! Flown"
2083,SYMBOLS,"Beyond the world, upon that fleeing wind,"
2084,SYMBOLS,"I reach the gulf’s irrespirable verge,"
2085,SYMBOLS,"Where fails the strongest storm for breath and fall,"
2086,SYMBOLS,"Supportless, through the nadir-plunged gloom,"
2087,SYMBOLS,"Beyond the scope and vision of the sun,"
2088,SYMBOLS,To other skies and systems. In a world
2089,SYMBOLS,"Deep-wooded with the multi-coloured fungi,"
2090,SYMBOLS,"That soar to semblance of fantastic palms,"
2091,SYMBOLS,"I fall as falls the meteor-stone, and break"
2092,SYMBOLS,"A score of trunks to powder. All unhurt,"
2093,SYMBOLS,"I rise, and through the illimitable woods,"
2094,SYMBOLS,"Among the trees of flimsy opal, roam,"
2095,SYMBOLS,"And see their tops that clamber, hour by hour,"
2096,SYMBOLS,"To touch the suns of iris. Things unseen,"
2097,SYMBOLS,Whose charnel breath informs the tideless air
2098,SYMBOLS,"With spreading pools of fetor, follow me"
2099,SYMBOLS,Elusive past the ever-changing palms;
2100,SYMBOLS,"And pittering moths, with wide and ashen wings,"
2101,SYMBOLS,"Flit on before, and insects ember-hued,"
2102,SYMBOLS,"Descending, hurtle through the gorgeous gloom,"
2103,SYMBOLS,And quench themselves in crumbling thickets. Heard
2104,SYMBOLS,"Far-off, the gong-like roar of beasts unknown"
2105,SYMBOLS,"Resounds at measured intervals of time,"
2106,SYMBOLS,"Shaking the riper trees to dust, that falls"
2107,SYMBOLS,"In clouds of acrid perfume, stifling me"
2108,SYMBOLS,Beneath a pall of iris.
2109,SYMBOLS,Now the palms
2110,SYMBOLS,Grow far apart and lessen momently
2111,SYMBOLS,To shrubs a dwarf might topple. Over them
2112,SYMBOLS,"I see an empty desert, all ablaze"
2113,SYMBOLS,"With amethysts and rubies, and the dust"
2114,SYMBOLS,"Of garnets or carnelians. On I roam,"
2115,SYMBOLS,"Treading the gorgeous grit, that dazzles me"
2116,SYMBOLS,"With leaping waves of endless rutilance,"
2117,SYMBOLS,"Whereby the air is turned to a crimson gloom,"
2118,SYMBOLS,"Through which I wander, blind as any Kobold;"
2119,SYMBOLS,Till underfoot the griding sands give place
2120,SYMBOLS,"To stone or metal, with a massive ring"
2121,SYMBOLS,"More welcome to mine ears than golden bells,"
2122,SYMBOLS,Or tinkle of silver fountains. When the gloom
2123,SYMBOLS,"Of crimson lifts, I stand upon the edge"
2124,SYMBOLS,"Of a broad black plain of adamant, that reaches,"
2125,SYMBOLS,"Level as a windless water, to the verge"
2126,SYMBOLS,"Of all the world; and through the sable plain,"
2127,SYMBOLS,"A hundred streams of shattered marble run,"
2128,SYMBOLS,"And streams of broken steel, and streams of bronze,"
2129,SYMBOLS,"Like to the ruin of all the wars of time,"
2130,SYMBOLS,"To plunge, with clangour of timeless cataracts,"
2131,SYMBOLS,Adown the gulfs eternal.
2132,SYMBOLS,"So I follow,"
2133,SYMBOLS,"Between a river of steel and a river of bronze,"
2134,SYMBOLS,With ripples loud and tuneless as the clash
2135,SYMBOLS,Of a million lutes; and come to the precipice
2136,SYMBOLS,"From which they fall, and make the mighty sound"
2137,SYMBOLS,"Of a million swords that meet a million shields,"
2138,SYMBOLS,Or din of spears and armour in the wars
2139,SYMBOLS,"Of all the worlds and aeons: Far beneath,"
2140,SYMBOLS,"They fall, through gulfs and cycles of the void,"
2141,SYMBOLS,"And vanish like a stream of broken stars,"
2142,SYMBOLS,Into the nether darkness; nor the gods
2143,SYMBOLS,"Of any sun, nor demons of the gulf,"
2144,SYMBOLS,Will dare to know what everlasting sea
2145,SYMBOLS,"Is fed thereby, and mounts forevermore"
2146,SYMBOLS,With mighty tides unebbing.
2147,SYMBOLS,"Lo, what cloud,"
2148,SYMBOLS,"Or night of sudden and supreme eclipse,"
2149,SYMBOLS,"Is on the suns of opal? At my side,"
2150,SYMBOLS,"The rivers rail with a wan and ghostly gleam,"
2151,SYMBOLS,Through darkness falling as the night that falls
2152,SYMBOLS,"From mighty spheres extinguished! Turning now,"
2153,SYMBOLS,"I see, betwixt the desert and the suns,"
2154,SYMBOLS,"The poised wings of all the dragon-rout,"
2155,SYMBOLS,Far-flown in black occlusion thousand-fold
2156,SYMBOLS,"Through stars, and deeps, and devastated worlds,"
2157,SYMBOLS,"Upon my trail of terror! Griffins, rocs,"
2158,SYMBOLS,"And sluggish, dark chimeras, heavy-winged"
2159,SYMBOLS,"After the ravin of dispeopled lands,"
2160,SYMBOLS,"With harpies, and the vulture-birds of hell—"
2161,SYMBOLS,Hot from abominable feasts and fain
2162,SYMBOLS,To cool their beaks and talons in my blood—
2163,SYMBOLS,"All, all have gathered, and the wingless rear,"
2164,SYMBOLS,"With rank on rank of foul, colossal Worms,"
2165,SYMBOLS,"Like pillars of embattled night and flame,"
2166,SYMBOLS,"Looms on the wide horizon! From the van,"
2167,SYMBOLS,"I hear the shriek of wyvers, loud and shrill"
2168,SYMBOLS,"As tempests in a broken fane, and roar"
2169,SYMBOLS,"Of sphinxes, like the unrelenting toll"
2170,SYMBOLS,"Of bells from tow’rs infernal. Cloud on cloud,"
2171,SYMBOLS,"They arch the zenith, and a dreadful wind"
2172,SYMBOLS,Falls from them like the wind before the storm.
2173,SYMBOLS,"And in the wind my cloven garment streams,"
2174,SYMBOLS,"And flutters in the face of all the void,"
2175,SYMBOLS,"Even as flows a flaffing spirit, lost"
2176,SYMBOLS,On the Pit’s undying tempest! Louder grows
2177,SYMBOLS,The thunder of the streams of stone and bronze.—

3007,THE GHOUL,The cates whereof thou braggest were as wind
3008,THE GHOUL,"In halls where men had feasted yesterday,"
3009,THE GHOUL,Or furbished bones the full hyena leaves:
3010,THE GHOUL,"Tiger and pig have their apportioned glut,"
3011,THE GHOUL,Nor lacks the shark his provender; the bird
3012,THE GHOUL,"Is nourished with the worm of charnels; man,"
3013,THE GHOUL,"Or the grey wolf, will slay and eat the bird,"

3018,THE GHOUL,The rightful meat my belly’s law demands.***
3019,THE GHOUL,"Eaters of death are all: Life shall not live,"
3020,THE GHOUL,Save that its food be death; No atomy
3021,THE GHOUL,"In any star, or heaven’s remotest moon,"
3022,THE GHOUL,But hath a billion billion times been made
3023,THE GHOUL,"The food of insatiable life, and food"
3024,THE GHOUL,Of death insatiate: For all is change—
3025,THE GHOUL,"Change, that hath wrought the chancre and the rose,"
3026,THE GHOUL,"And wrought the star, and wrought the sapphire-stone,"
3027,THE GHOUL,"And lit great altars, and the eyes of lions—"
3028,THE GHOUL,"Change, that hath made the very gods from slime"
3029,THE GHOUL,"Drawn from the pits of Python, and will fling"
3030,THE GHOUL,Gods and their builded heavens back again
3031,THE GHOUL,To slime. The fruits of archangelic light
3032,THE GHOUL,"Thou braggest of, and grapes of azure wine,"
3033,THE GHOUL,"Have been the dung of dragons, and the blood"
3034,THE GHOUL,Of toads in Phlegethon; each particle

3036,THE GHOUL,"Through suns, and worlds, and cycles infinite—"
3037,THE GHOUL,"Through burning brume of systems unbegun,"
3038,THE GHOUL,"Or manes of long-haired comets, that have lashed"
3039,THE GHOUL,The night of space to fury and to fire;
3040,THE GHOUL,"And in the core of cold and lightless stars,"
3041,THE GHOUL,And in immalleable metals deep.
3042,THE GHOUL,"Each atomy hath slept, or known the slime"
3043,THE GHOUL,Of Cyclopean oceans turned to air
3044,THE GHOUL,Before the suns of Ophinchus rose;
3045,THE GHOUL,"And they have known the interstellar night,"
3046,THE GHOUL,And they have lain at root of sightless flowr’s
3047,THE GHOUL,"In worlds without a sun, or at the heart"
3048,THE GHOUL,"Of monstrous-eyed and panting flow’rs of flesh,"
3049,THE GHOUL,Or aeon-blooming amaranths of stone:
3050,THE GHOUL,And they have ministered within the brains
3051,THE GHOUL,"Of sages and magicians, and have served"
3052,THE GHOUL,"To swell the pulse of kings or conquerors,"
3053,THE GHOUL,And have been privy to the hearts of queens.

3746,THE TRAVELLER,"With thy brow that alien suns have darkened, and thy hair made white"

3748,THE TRAVELLER,"cities greater than Rome, with walls of opal and crystal, and fanes"
3749,THE TRAVELLER,"more white than the summer clouds, or the foam of hyperboreal seas?"

3758,THE TRAVELLER,"from the first immemorable years of my youth till now, and have mingled"
3759,THE TRAVELLER,"the dust of many realms, of many highways, in my garments’ hem. I have"
3760,THE TRAVELLER,"seen the cities greater than Rome, and the fanes more white than the"
3761,THE TRAVELLER,"clouds of summer; the lands unpeopled and unexplored, and the land that"

3771,THE TRAVELLER,"of the seventh sea, is the place thereof recorded. And its name I"
3772,THE TRAVELLER,"have never learned, howbeit I have learned the name of empires lying"
3773,THE TRAVELLER,"beneath stars to us invisible. In many languages have I spoken, in"

3775,THE TRAVELLER,"men, even of them that inhabit the strange isles of the sea of fire"
3776,THE TRAVELLER,"and the sea of snow. Thunder, and lutes, and battle-drums, the fine"

3780,THE TRAVELLER,"sob like fountains; whispers and shoutings of fire, the multitudinous"

3807,THE FLOWER-DEVIL,"plants that palpitate like hearts, the blossoms that pant with a breath"
3808,THE FLOWER-DEVIL,"of venomous perfume—over all these, the Flower-Devil is supreme, in"

3879,THE BLACK LAKE,In a land where weirdness and mystery had strongly leagued themselves

4474,THE SHADOWS,There were many shadows in the palace of Augusthes. About the silver
4475,THE SHADOWS,"throne that had blackened beneath the invisible passing of ages, they"
4476,THE SHADOWS,fell from pillar and broken roof and fretted window in ever-shifting
4477,THE SHADOWS,"multiformity. Seeming the black, fantastic spectres of doom and"
4478,THE SHADOWS,"desolation, they moved through the palace in a gradual, grave, and"
4479,THE SHADOWS,"imperceptible dance, whose music was the change and motion of suns and"
4480,THE SHADOWS,"moons. They were long and slender, like all other shadows before the"
4481,THE SHADOWS,"early light, and behind the declining sun; squat and intense beneath"
4482,THE SHADOWS,"the desert noontide, and faint with the withered moon; and in the"
4483,THE SHADOWS,"interlunar darkness, they were as myriad tongues hidden behind the shut"
4484,THE SHADOWS,and silent lips of night.
4485,THE SHADOWS,
4486,THE SHADOWS,"One came daily to that place of shadows and desolation, and sate upon"
4487,THE SHADOWS,"the silver throne, watching the shadows that were of desolation. King"
4488,THE SHADOWS,"nor slave disputed him there, in the palace whose kings and whose"
4489,THE SHADOWS,slaves were powerless alike in the intangible dungeon of centuries. The
4490,THE SHADOWS,tombs of unnumbered and forgotten monarchs were white upon the yellow
4491,THE SHADOWS,"desert roundabout. Some had partly rotted away, and showed like the"
4492,THE SHADOWS,sunken eye-sockets of a skull—blank and lidless beneath the staring
4493,THE SHADOWS,"heavens; others still retained the undesecrated seal of death, and were"
4494,THE SHADOWS,as the closed eyes of one lately dead. But he who watched the shadows
4495,THE SHADOWS,"from the silver throne, heeded not these, nor the fleet wind that dipt"
4496,THE SHADOWS,"to the broken tombs, and emerged shrilly, its unseen hands dark with"
4497,THE SHADOWS,the dust of kings.
4498,THE SHADOWS,
4499,THE SHADOWS,"He was a philosopher, from what land there was none to know or ask."
4500,THE SHADOWS,Nor was there any to ask what knowledge or delight he sought in the
4501,THE SHADOWS,"ruined palace, with eyes alway upon the moving shadows; nor what were"
4502,THE SHADOWS,the thoughts that moved through his mind in ghostly unison with them.
4503,THE SHADOWS,His eyes were old and sad with meditation and wisdom; and his beard was
4504,THE SHADOWS,long and white upon his long white robe.
4505,THE SHADOWS,
4506,THE SHADOWS,For many days he came with the dawn and departed with sunset; and his
4507,THE SHADOWS,shadow leaned from the shadow of the throne and moved with the others.
4508,THE SHADOWS,But one eve he departed not; and thereafter his shadow was one with the
4509,THE SHADOWS,"shadow of the silver throne. Death found and left him there, where he"
4510,THE SHADOWS,dwindled into dust that was as the dust of slaves or kings.
4511,THE SHADOWS,
4512,THE SHADOWS,"But the ebb and refluence of shadows went on, in the days that were"
4513,THE SHADOWS,"before the end; ere the aged world, astray with the sun in strange"
4514,THE SHADOWS,"heavens, should be lost in the cosmic darkness, or, under the influence"
4515,THE SHADOWS,"of other and conflicting gravitations, should crumble apart and bare"
4516,THE SHADOWS,"its granite bones to the light of strange suns, and the granite, too,"
4517,THE SHADOWS,"should dissolve, and be as of the dust of slaves and kings. Noon was"
4518,THE SHADOWS,"encircled with darkness, and the depths of palace-dusk were chasmed"
4519,THE SHADOWS,"with sunlight. Change there was none, other than this, for the earth"
4520,THE SHADOWS,"was dead, and stirred not to the tottering feet of time. And in the"
4521,THE SHADOWS,"expectant silence before the twilight of the sun, the moving shadows"
4522,THE SHADOWS,seemed but a mockery of change; a meaningless antic phantasmagoria of
4523,THE SHADOWS,things that were; an afterfiguring of forgotten time.
4524,THE SHADOWS,
4525,THE SHADOWS,"And now the sun was darkened slowly in mid-heaven, as by some vast"
4526,THE SHADOWS,and invisible bulk. And twilight hushed the shadows in the palace of
4527,THE SHADOWS,"Augusthes, as the world itself swung down toward the long and single"
4528,THE SHADOWS,shadow of irretrievable oblivion.
