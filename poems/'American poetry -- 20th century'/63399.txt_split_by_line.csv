32,POEMS,The only editorial policy of THE GLEBE is that embodied in its
33,POEMS,"declaration of absolute freedom of expression, which makes for a range"
34,POEMS,broad enough to include every temperament from the most radical to the
35,POEMS,"most conservative, the only requisite being that the work should have"
36,POEMS,unmistakable merit. Each issue will be devoted exclusively to one
37,POEMS,"individual, thereby giving him an opportunity to present his work in"
38,POEMS,sufficient bulk to make it possible for the reader to obtain a much more
39,POEMS,comprehensive grasp of his personality than is afforded him in the
40,POEMS,"restricted spaces allotted by the other magazines. Published monthly,"
41,POEMS,"THE GLEBE will issue twelve books per year, chosen on their merits"
42,POEMS,"alone, since the subscription list does away with the need of catering"
43,POEMS,"to the popular demand that confronts every publisher. Thus, THE GLEBE"
44,POEMS,"can promise the best work of American and foreign authors, known and"
45,POEMS,unknown.
46,POEMS,
47,POEMS,The price of each issue of THE GLEBE will be fifty cents and the yearly
48,POEMS,subscription three dollars.

102,THE PRAYER,
103,THE PRAYER,Like a cat beside a pool
104,THE PRAYER,"More than half afraid of it,"
105,THE PRAYER,Fishing gingerly I sit
106,THE PRAYER,Here beside this pool of wit--
107,THE PRAYER,Dumb as any fool!
108,THE PRAYER,Chirrups humor in the grass;
109,THE PRAYER,"Winds of tickling laughter pass,"
110,THE PRAYER,"And the world grows wise forsooth,"
111,THE PRAYER,Lets gleam amused tooth
112,THE PRAYER,Seeing in this water-glass
113,THE PRAYER,"Jests that swim the depths of truth,"
114,THE PRAYER,And like fins of fishes shiver
115,THE PRAYER,It to fretful quirk and quiver.

132,THE PRAYER,Draw my sullen mouth apart.
133,THE PRAYER,Give a gleam to guide me by
134,THE PRAYER,As a phare in a night-sky--
135,THE PRAYER,Grace of tongue and warmth of eye;
136,THE PRAYER,Give me of thy fire and dew;
137,THE PRAYER,Give me flash of mimic art--

146,THE PRAYER,Am a satyr turned to stone;
147,THE PRAYER,Satyr--satyr--not a man!
148,THE PRAYER,Gifts I ask not of Apollo--

276,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT
277,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
278,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
279,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,No human foot-print here before my own!
280,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,And it is strange to come so far--alone--
281,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,So far into this frozen forest world
282,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Of moonlight and of shadow and deep snow,"
283,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"And things I do not know,"
284,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,That strike the civil vestments from my soul--
285,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,As if all law-born years were backward hurled
286,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Toward some dim and other pole--
287,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Some brute primordial reign
288,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Whose voice was terror and whose life was pain.
289,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
290,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,On--up the trail I go;
291,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Beneath my feet cold streams of moonlight glow,"
292,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"And in the silver-sifted dark strange, naked fancies grow,"
293,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"While the vast pines in vista, round by round,"
294,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Move with an unearthly sound,"
295,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,And every tree with its white hair is crowned.
296,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
297,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"On--up--I go,"
298,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,And as thru ancient Gothic arches seen
299,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,I glimpse the valley far below
300,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,That glistens with a fine fantastic sheen.
301,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
302,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"On--up--I pass,"
303,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Nor reck the night-wrought spells about me thrown,"
304,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Heedless--sucked dry of thought or will
305,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Save to peer curious into this magician's glass,"
306,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,And see the forest dreams thru forest moonlight blown.
307,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,On--up I plunge--until
308,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Bending, discern before me, with a thrill"
309,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,The signs where some wild beast has gone.
310,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
311,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Who knows but that within the silence here
312,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"The cedar shadows gloom about a deer,"
313,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,That stands with body lithe and slim
314,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Struck to a statue by surprise?
315,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"Who knows but that, upon some snowy limb"
316,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"A lynx, lean-bellied, pricks his tufted ear"
317,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,"And watches me with evil, amber eyes?"
318,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
319,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,*       *       *       *       *
320,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,
321,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,Surely beyond the stars my man-world lies--
322,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,For close to me unhallowed mountains rise
323,THE TRAIL BY NIGHT,And fill my heart with fear!

1438,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Whose long blades lifted to each lifting crest.
1439,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1440,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Happy were the sailors to be aboard once more,"
1441,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,And the laughing sea answered to their shouts afar off shore.
1442,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1443,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Dido the Queen
1444,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Knew he was gone.
1445,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,No need to have seen
1446,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,From the casement withdrawn;
1447,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,No need to be told;
1448,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Her heart had guessed
1449,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,By the aching unrest
1450,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,And empty breast--
1451,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Empty and cold.
1452,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1453,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Oh, plain her Maidens at their spinning,"
1454,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Love has end that had beginning.
1455,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1456,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"As the course was traced Aeneas paced,"
1457,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,His thoughts uprising like a flock of birds;
1458,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"And one flew west, to the new the unknown nest,"
1459,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,And one that was wing'd with flaming words--
1460,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Something the Queen had uttered, tender--sweet,--"
1461,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Fluttered back and died--just at her feet.
1462,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1463,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Ho! chants a Rower, straining at the sweep,"
1464,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Leave the landsman to his pillow, the sailor to the deep."
1465,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1466,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,All night the Queen
1467,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,In fever burned;
1468,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,A dream returned
1469,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Long ago seen:
1470,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"A dream of ships,"
1471,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Of one who came
1472,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Out of a flame
1473,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,And cried her name
1474,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,And kissed her lips.
1475,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1476,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Somewhere in the dawn Someone's singing:
1477,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"""Lo! what gifts love's hands are bringing!"""
1478,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1479,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Jet-black, the palms like sculptured fountains loomed"
1480,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Above the lovers; one star blazed all night.
1481,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Beyond the river was the sea that boomed.
1482,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Their barge was lit with lightnings of delight.
1483,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Of this, the good Aeneas too had dreamed"
1484,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,While the unshaken towers of Ilium gleamed.
1485,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1486,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Ah! cry the sailors, ""whom we loved must wait."
1487,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"There's no turning back from the open track to the gates of fate."""
1488,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1489,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,The cicadas drone;
1490,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Desert winds blow
1491,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,As oarsmen row
1492,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Their Queen alone
1493,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Down the river.
1494,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Alone, she cried"
1495,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Alone! to the tide.
1496,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,And the sea replied
1497,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Forever!
1498,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1499,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"La, croon the Women, nimbly weaving,"
1500,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"""Whose heart do we hear grieving?"""
1501,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1502,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Months bring all wanderings to a close.
1503,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"The fleet years flee; Aeneas wisely wed,"
1504,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Often, when wind and sea strike mighty blows,"
1505,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Wakening from dreams half ecstasy, half dread,"
1506,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"That come upon him from another life,"
1507,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Touches the calm breast of his sleeping wife.
1508,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1509,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Hum, the Night Watch mutters, leaning on his spear,"
1510,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"""'Tis a strange world to be in and to have no fear."""
1511,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1512,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,The sea at last
1513,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Brings pain to end.
1514,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,The desert vast
1515,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Becomes her friend.
1516,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,Her people fear it:
1517,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"""The Queen,"" they say,"
1518,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"""Grows day by day"
1519,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Paler, but still gay--"
1520,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"As a spirit."""
1521,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,
1522,ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO,"Oh, they murmur, ""Queen Dido goes away"
