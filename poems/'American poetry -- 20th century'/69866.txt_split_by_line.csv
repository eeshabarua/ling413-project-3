368,STARS,"You turned toward Brittany, awake, alone,"
369,STARS,"In the high chamber hushed, save where the candle dripped"
370,STARS,With the slow patient sound of blood on stone.
371,STARS,
372,STARS,"The ache of empty arms was an old tale to you,"
373,STARS,"And all the tragic tunes that love can play,"
