237,THE SECRET WAY,
238,THE SECRET WAY,Stark on the window’s early grey
239,THE SECRET WAY,"Lined out in squares by casement bars,"
240,THE SECRET WAY,She saw her lily lift to take
241,THE SECRET WAY,The sinking stars.
242,THE SECRET WAY,
243,THE SECRET WAY,Within the room’s delaying dark
244,THE SECRET WAY,Intimate things lay dim and still
245,THE SECRET WAY,With all their day-time friendliness
246,THE SECRET WAY,Gone false and chill.
247,THE SECRET WAY,
248,THE SECRET WAY,"Her hand upon the coverlet,"
249,THE SECRET WAY,"Her face low in the linen’s cleft,"
250,THE SECRET WAY,They were as wan as water-flowers
251,THE SECRET WAY,By light bereft.
252,THE SECRET WAY,
253,THE SECRET WAY,And never was bloom brought to her couch
254,THE SECRET WAY,But shed the odour of a sigh
255,THE SECRET WAY,"Because she was as white as they,"
256,THE SECRET WAY,And they must die.
257,THE SECRET WAY,
258,THE SECRET WAY,"“O Pale, lit deep within the dark"
259,THE SECRET WAY,"Of your young eyes, a stifled light"
260,THE SECRET WAY,Leaps thin and keen as melody
261,THE SECRET WAY,And leavens night.
262,THE SECRET WAY,
263,THE SECRET WAY,“It is a light that did not burn
264,THE SECRET WAY,When you were gay at mart and fair;
265,THE SECRET WAY,"O Pale, what is that starry fire,"
266,THE SECRET WAY,Fed unaware?”
267,THE SECRET WAY,
268,THE SECRET WAY,Then softly she: “I may not tell
269,THE SECRET WAY,What other eyes behold in mine;
270,THE SECRET WAY,But I have melted night and day
271,THE SECRET WAY,In some wild wine.
272,THE SECRET WAY,
273,THE SECRET WAY,“I may not read the graven cup
274,THE SECRET WAY,Exhaustless as a brimming bell
275,THE SECRET WAY,Distilling silver; but I drank
276,THE SECRET WAY,And all is well.
277,THE SECRET WAY,
278,THE SECRET WAY,"“One morn like this, bitter still,"
279,THE SECRET WAY,I waited for the early stir
280,THE SECRET WAY,Of those who slept the while I watched
281,THE SECRET WAY,What muffled wonders were.
282,THE SECRET WAY,
283,THE SECRET WAY,“I saw my lily on the sill;
284,THE SECRET WAY,I saw my mirror on the wall
285,THE SECRET WAY,Take light that was not; and I saw
286,THE SECRET WAY,My spectral taper tall.
287,THE SECRET WAY,
288,THE SECRET WAY,“Why I had known these quiet things
289,THE SECRET WAY,Since I could speak. Yet suddenly
290,THE SECRET WAY,They all touched hands and in one breath
291,THE SECRET WAY,They spoke to me.
292,THE SECRET WAY,
293,THE SECRET WAY,“I may not tell you what they said.
294,THE SECRET WAY,The strange part is that I must lie
295,THE SECRET WAY,And never tell you what we say----
296,THE SECRET WAY,These things and I.
297,THE SECRET WAY,
298,THE SECRET WAY,“I only know that common things
299,THE SECRET WAY,Bear sudden little spirits set
300,THE SECRET WAY,Free by the rose of dawn and by
301,THE SECRET WAY,Night’s violet.
302,THE SECRET WAY,
303,THE SECRET WAY,“I only know that when I hear
304,THE SECRET WAY,"Clear tone, the haunted echoes bear"
305,THE SECRET WAY,Legions of little winged feet
306,THE SECRET WAY,On printless air.
307,THE SECRET WAY,
308,THE SECRET WAY,“And when warm colour weds my look
309,THE SECRET WAY,"A word is uttered tremblingly,"
310,THE SECRET WAY,With meaning fall--but I know not
311,THE SECRET WAY,What it may be.
312,THE SECRET WAY,
313,THE SECRET WAY,“I only know that now I find
314,THE SECRET WAY,Abiding beauty everywhere;
315,THE SECRET WAY,"Or if it bide not, that it fades"
316,THE SECRET WAY,Is still more fair.
317,THE SECRET WAY,
318,THE SECRET WAY,I long to question those I love
319,THE SECRET WAY,And yet I know not what to say;
320,THE SECRET WAY,I am alone as one upon
321,THE SECRET WAY,Some secret way.
322,THE SECRET WAY,
323,THE SECRET WAY,“My words are barren of my bliss;
324,THE SECRET WAY,The strange part is that I must lie
325,THE SECRET WAY,And never tell you what we say--
326,THE SECRET WAY,These things and I.
327,THE SECRET WAY,
328,THE SECRET WAY,“So will it be when I am not.
329,THE SECRET WAY,A little more perhaps to tell;
330,THE SECRET WAY,Yet then as now I may not say
331,THE SECRET WAY,What I know well.”
332,THE SECRET WAY,
333,THE SECRET WAY,She died when all the east was red.
334,THE SECRET WAY,And we are they who know her fate
335,THE SECRET WAY,Because we love the way of life
336,THE SECRET WAY,That she had found too late.

401,II: MAGIC,An ancient wildwood showed its heart to me.
402,II: MAGIC,(O Little Wind that brought me what it said!)
403,II: MAGIC,I went within its great nave reverently.
404,II: MAGIC,
405,II: MAGIC,There dwelt the silence ever lightly wed
406,II: MAGIC,With winged sound. There the persuading green
407,II: MAGIC,Took ancient citadels with soundless tread.
408,II: MAGIC,
409,II: MAGIC,Was not the opening blue of buds between
410,II: MAGIC,Soft solitary leaves a lyric set
411,II: MAGIC,To music of the things that lift and lean?
412,II: MAGIC,
413,II: MAGIC,My hands were mother-tender of the net
414,II: MAGIC,Of silk they found. My feet were light
415,II: MAGIC,To loose no dew from the least violet.
416,II: MAGIC,
417,II: MAGIC,The fragile fabric of dissolved night
418,II: MAGIC,Seemed in the air. A million little minds
419,II: MAGIC,Kept concert in the very realm of sight.
420,II: MAGIC,
421,II: MAGIC,O--and suddenly as sunlight finds
422,II: MAGIC,White towers I heard the ancient wood unfold
423,II: MAGIC,Its ancient secret piped by little winds.
424,II: MAGIC,
425,II: MAGIC,“Behold the beauty in me. O behold
426,II: MAGIC,"The beauty that makes utter peace, in me;"
427,II: MAGIC,Beauty that is immeasurably old.”
428,II: MAGIC,
429,II: MAGIC,The whole world like a bell heard echoingly.
430,II: MAGIC,Words wonderful! I found a fairy bed
431,II: MAGIC,And saw that which the wildwood let me see.

829,BY MY SIDE ALL DAY ANOTHER WENT,The gleaner hunts me down
830,BY MY SIDE ALL DAY ANOTHER WENT,Bringing regret. I wear it for a crown.

844,I,
845,I,"Here a light, there a leaf,"
846,I,Little boughs that lean;

850,I,"“Look,” they say, “there a star"
851,I,Watching in a well;

867,II,It is like the covenant
868,II,Of a clearer sight.
869,II,
870,II,Now a sudden bud is born
871,II,Burning in the dew;
872,II,There the fog rose palely lifting
873,II,All as if it knew
874,II,The faint flowing speech
875,II,Of the friendly blue.
876,II,
877,II,Oh the little hurrying wing
878,II,Like a blowing leaf;
879,II,Oh the shadows gathering in
880,II,Many a sheaf;
881,II,There a cloud is carved like some
882,II,Airy coral reef.
883,II,
884,II,Like a new sense these venture
885,II,"In the veins and lo,"
886,II,All the blood is musical
887,II,In its beat and flow;

889,II,What new thing we know.

926,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The air is purged of gold and in its stead
927,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Is poured a fire of silver on the green;
928,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And now the moon new-risen from the dead
929,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Of dearer nights than this finds her demesne
930,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Lonely of stars, as they to greet their queen"
931,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Had rushed in argent riot from the blue
932,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,To spill themselves like flowers or waste unseen
933,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,In stealing perfumes that elude and woo
934,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,As now eludes now woos the wind the sweet night through.
935,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
936,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Down from her turret when the dusk was new
937,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The Lady Margot stepped and lured by wile
938,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Of faint near things that croon of what they do
939,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,With wandering touch she thought to walk the while
940,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The hours were printless on the idle dial.
941,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Deep in a garden lamped with lily bells
942,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Which hold the light as does some opal vial
943,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,She took her way near where a fountain wells
944,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And wakes its rainbow ribbons into madrigals.
945,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
946,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Fluttering she peered within the hollow gloom
947,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,That cloistered a wild wood beyond the wall;
948,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,For shapes are woven by the troubled loom
949,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Of night; and tremulous tapestries oft fall
950,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Across familiar paths and make them all
951,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Astir with effigies that snarl and grin
952,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And take strange steps along a horrid hall
953,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Which is by day a lane of leaves within;
954,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,As if at night a holy nun should dream of sin.
955,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
956,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,At length she reached a little windless glade
957,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Fragrant with natal April not long flown
958,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And dreamful of the days when lips were laid
959,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,On lips that trembled as they found their own.
960,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,There where the mooned close was thickest sown
961,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,With shadows was the lady met with one
962,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Who sat with drooping head and made soft moan.
963,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,He was a stranger knight whose armour shone
964,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Bright as the molten golden javelins of the sun.
965,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
966,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,“What things are griefs?” the Lady Margot sighed
967,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And moved a little nearer pityingly.
968,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"“The wonder wasteth from my days,” he cried,"
969,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,“The burden of my blessings wearieth me!
970,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Lo I have journeyed from an unoared sea
971,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,In the white north to where the winds caress
972,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Warm sail-sown oceans murmuring round a key
973,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Odorous with wine and fruit in fragrant dress----
974,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And yet I passion for some little happiness.”
975,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
976,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"“Ay, now,” the lady cried, “most strangely come"
977,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Are you, Sir Knight, for I am one who longs"
978,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,As never heart has longed before for some
979,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Strange world, strange tongue tuneful with alien songs,"
980,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Strange mad old cities brooding on their wrongs,"
981,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,With unfamiliar streets which smile and show
982,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Me many a colonnade and portico
983,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Where some unclaimed and starry hour belongs.
984,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,O you who know all that I long for--bid me go!”
985,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
986,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,No strange thing seemed her prayer unto the knight
987,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Who knew her father’s little court by name,"
988,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And pitied her that all her beauty bright
989,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Must fail and fade in such confined fame.
990,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Swiftly he knelt to her and with no shame
991,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,She gave her hand the while he led her where
992,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Within the close the moon took silvery aim
993,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And lured a sickle bed of bloom to bear
994,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,In bloom’s sweet stead a birth of stars pearly as air.
995,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
996,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The lady stooped and laid her little hand
997,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Upon a dreaming lily whose faint cream
998,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"And gold, stirred at the fingers’ soft demand,"
999,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Dreamed that the white touch was their sweetest dream.
1000,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The lady rose and every opiate beam
1001,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Made lucent pillage from her unbound hair
1002,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And moths brushed lightly through the saffron stream
1003,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,In quest of stars. The lady was so fair
1004,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,That the dusk swooned with passion and the light with prayer.
1005,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1006,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"“Nay, now, my child,” the knight said courteously,"
1007,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"“Would that your joy lay in your castle home,"
1008,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"In phantom folk who pace your broidery,"
1009,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,In haunted parchment of a pictured tome.
1010,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,But if you are of those whose hearts must roam
1011,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Afar afield to meet the hushed advance
1012,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Of spheres and win from the blown spray and foam
1013,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,What weaker some leave to impotent chance
1014,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Then, by my blade, that blade shall bring deliverance!”"
1015,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1016,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"A little door, covert in creeping green,"
1017,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Gave from the court upon the room where lay
1018,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"The aged doting nurse who wept, I ween,"
1019,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,At all the Lady Margot strove to say.
1020,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"But when it had proved vain to weep or pray,"
1021,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,She rose and bade her trembling fingers light
1022,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Her taper and thereby she led the way
1023,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Through secret gates till, soberly bedight,"
1024,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The three set forth together in the faery night.
1025,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1026,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"O many a league for many a day they went,"
1027,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And some magician kind they were aware
1028,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Delivered captive treasuries and spent
1029,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,His lavish store of beauty everywhere:
1030,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Slim brazen towers that taught the sun to share
1031,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Its shining he revealed; and odorous gloom
1032,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Packing with odours the receiving air;
1033,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Flowered silken sails that set the sea abloom;
1034,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Isles spread with fabrics from the moon’s high loom.
1035,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1036,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Sometimes the lady knelt in a fleet prow
1037,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"That flung the gaudy bubbles from the blue,"
1038,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And joyed to hear the lean blade of the bow
1039,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Plunging the thundering sundered breakers through;
1040,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Keen swept the foam-born breaths of salt, to do"
1041,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Sweet violence to her pale cheek; and all
1042,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The spirit of her fancy peopled new
1043,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The perilous sea’s impermanent citadel
1044,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,That kindled into spray with the ship’s rise and fall.
1045,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1046,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Sometimes she stepped within a pillared way
1047,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Dim grey with shade and honey-bright with sun
1048,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Where all the costly stuffs for barter lay,"
1049,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"And she might hear how many a drowsing one,"
1050,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Stretched on a pea-cock patterned skin, would run"
1051,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Soft syllable along soft syllable
1052,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Praising the violet and vermilion
1053,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Of gems and cloths, right eager-tongued to tell"
1054,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,News musical with names to one who loved them well.
1055,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1056,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Meanwhile the stranger knight was by her side
1057,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Burning to serve and welcoming command;
1058,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And never wish of hers might be denied
1059,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,For his swift sword was like a dexterous wand.
1060,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And by her side in all that alien land
1061,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"The old nurse journeyed plaintive and perplexed,"
1062,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Condemning what she did not understand
1063,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And with all other understanding vexed;
1064,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Palsied and muttering charms for what should tide them next.
1065,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1066,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Then it befell that as they fared the knight
1067,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Forgot his weariness and many a morn
1068,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,He faced with joy the lottery of light
1069,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And walked no more apart in mood forlorn.
1070,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"And now, her tremulous shyness half outworn,"
1071,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The Lady Margot oft passed through a town
1072,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And saw therein but trinkets to adorn
1073,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Her little bodice and her silken gown;
1074,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And when he spoke she looked up swiftly and looked down.
1075,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1076,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,O sweet it was to see the two dream on.
1077,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,She wistful of the runes that he could teach
1078,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Of men and cities dreamed that in such wan
1079,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Delights lay life; and he for her sweet speech
1080,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,With all its faery fancies would beseech
1081,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And dreamed that in such fancies lay delight!
1082,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And all the time the heart of each for each
1083,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Was calling with the ancient urge of night
1084,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,For night what time the lotus of the dawn is white.
1085,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1086,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,At length they came to a melodious marge
1087,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Where with sweet perturbation the moved sea
1088,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Crept lovingly about the land in large
1089,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Embrace and from such soft nativity
1090,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The music mounted in dissolving key
1091,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And wed with wind. There in a crescent cove
1092,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Sun-lorn and still, the eyes of each leaped free"
1093,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And all the world in a wild silence strove
1094,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,To bare its spirit in their breathed words of love.
1095,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1096,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"“O Sweet, my Sweet,” the knight quoth reverently,"
1097,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,“Lo now the marvel: That I wearied sore
1098,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,On such a singing earth as this to be
1099,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,One whom the gods give ever one gift more!
1100,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,There is no spot from shore to patient shore
1101,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,That is not burdened with its waiting bliss;
1102,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"O yet, dear love, how little bliss it bore"
1103,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Were you not near to tremble at my kiss.
1104,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,At last we know the truth: The best of life is this.”
1105,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1106,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Slow-dipped the idle sail without the bay
1107,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Sun-smitten in the drowsy afternoon;
1108,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Unimaged in the ripples’ purple play
1109,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,White reefs of clouds on airy shores were strewn.
1110,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,All fairly the shadows fell and soon
1111,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,When gloaming was poured soft on beach and foam
1112,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The sea gave up a silver shell--the moon.
1113,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Then tenderly she turned who longed to roam
1114,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Afar and whispered: “Love, would that our way led home!”"
1115,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1116,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Nearby upon a rainbow drift of weeds
1117,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"The old nurse mumbled at her prayers and charms,"
1118,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"And now her shaking fingers felt her beads,"
1119,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And now in incantation her old arms
1120,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Were raised to shadowy powers. O grim alarms
1121,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Beset the gaping ones when love appears!
1122,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And never lovers’ glance or kiss half warms
1123,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The world but that some dotard nods and leers
1124,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And all the charnel souls are tip-toe with their fears.
1125,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1126,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Now silently across the glimmering sands
1127,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Slow-paced the lady and the stranger knight,"
1128,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And there were clinging lips and clinging hands
1129,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And all the uses of the hour were bright;
1130,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,But when they came to where the moon was white
1131,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Upon the wet weeds, there the old dame lay"
1132,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Stark on the sea-moss and the labyrinth light
1133,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Received her soul that knew it not. There may
1134,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Be heaven for such as mock at love but none can say.
1135,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1136,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Upon the sands the lady knelt and wept;
1137,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Her lover kissed away her pitying tears;
1138,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"“Nay, tender soul,” he said, “we have but kept"
1139,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The truce of nature with the yester-years.
1140,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Now are the old things passed away, and fears"
1141,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,For the new day are vain. Therefore arise.
1142,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Love vanquishes the past itself. Love hears
1143,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The siren cities chant of home. Love’s eyes
1144,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Have lit a sullen world for me to Paradise.”
1145,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,
1146,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Into the silver dark the lovers went,"
1147,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,"Over the silver sea to golden isles,"
1148,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,Piping their songs of heavenly wonderment
1149,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And fabling the unhaunted age with smiles.
1150,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,And ever with the swift melodious miles
1151,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,A sterner harmony breathed through their bliss;
1152,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,“The old shall be outworn. That which reviles
1153,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,The gods shall perish by their ministries.
1154,EXERCISE IN SPENSERIANS,But we will walk with truth: The best of life is this.”

1724,LIGHT,Have met familiars there
1725,LIGHT,And kept our step in exquisite concord
1726,LIGHT,The while we spoke some unremembered word.
1727,LIGHT,And over all there lay
1728,LIGHT,Light whose vibrations ran to other keys
1729,LIGHT,Than those we woke upon. Light whose long play
1730,LIGHT,Was dappled colour delicately kissed.
1731,LIGHT,Strange fires rayed from strange regions of the Lord.
1732,LIGHT,Light from the sun behind the sun fell where
1733,LIGHT,We went to keep our tryst.
1734,LIGHT,
1735,LIGHT,In sleep and in the solitary dusk there come
1736,LIGHT,"Fine lines of light upon the lowered lids,"
1737,LIGHT,A flush that lets us in the heart of night
1738,LIGHT,And hints dear wonders to be there at home;
1739,LIGHT,As if the universal fabric bids
1740,LIGHT,Its human pattern know that all is light.
1741,LIGHT,In snow
1742,LIGHT,Have we not seen the whiteness smitten through
1743,LIGHT,"With sudden rays of glory, vague with veils,"
1744,LIGHT,Of some beloved hue that pales
1745,LIGHT,To earthly rose and violet and blue?
1746,LIGHT,Oh you

1748,LIGHT,

1750,LIGHT,From without transition night
1751,LIGHT,"We would come into this, our own."
1752,LIGHT,Then the dim tune
1753,LIGHT,"The which we almost hear,"
1754,LIGHT,The low-keyed colour and the word
1755,LIGHT,"We have not heard,"
1756,LIGHT,"All these we shall be shown,"

1808,THE KILBOURN ROAD,THE KILBOURN ROAD
1809,THE KILBOURN ROAD,
1810,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"In June the road to Kilbourn is a long green hall,"
1811,THE KILBOURN ROAD,A corridor of leafage pillared white
1812,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"By birches and with wild-rose patterns on the wall,"
1813,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And all melodious with the fluid fall
1814,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Or lift of red-winged blackbirds fluting mating cries.
1815,THE KILBOURN ROAD,The very air
1816,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Is visible, not by the light,"
1817,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Not by the shades that drift
1818,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"And dip, but by an essence rhythmic with the flood"
1819,THE KILBOURN ROAD,That flows
1820,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Not in the sap, not in the blood,"
1821,THE KILBOURN ROAD,But otherwhere.
1822,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And of that essence grows
1823,THE KILBOURN ROAD,All men see in the air of Paradise.
1824,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He lay upon a little upland slope
1825,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Deep, deep with grass."
1826,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And when I saw his head above the green
1827,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Where I must pass,"
1828,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"The battered hat, the squinting eyes"
1829,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Blinking the westering sun, I felt a sting of fear----"
1830,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Alas, that in June’s delicate demesne"
1831,THE KILBOURN ROAD,A watching human face can teach one fear.
1832,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"So then I spoke to him, gave him good day,"
1833,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And seeing his gun said what I always say
1834,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Meeting a huntsman: “Friend, I hope"
1835,THE KILBOURN ROAD,You have killed nothing here.”
1836,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He stared and grinned. And with his grin
1837,THE KILBOURN ROAD,I felt his trustiness. So when
1838,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"He scrambled down the bank and followed me,"
1839,THE KILBOURN ROAD,I waited for him as my kind and kin.
1840,THE KILBOURN ROAD,
1841,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He was a thing of seventeen. And men
1842,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Compounded in his blood had set him here
1843,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Wizened and hump-backed. But his little face
1844,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Held something of the one he was to be
1845,THE KILBOURN ROAD,In some eternity.
1846,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"He talked as freely as a child. He’d shot, he said,"
1847,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"At a young wood-chuck. Now his gun was broke,"
1848,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And it’d cost a dollar and a half
1849,THE KILBOURN ROAD,To mend it. Then I spoke
1850,THE KILBOURN ROAD,About a little kerchief made of lace
1851,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Lost on the road that day. He turned his head.
1852,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"“Did it have money in it, Lady?”--with quick grace"
1853,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Caught from some knightlier place.
1854,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And when I asked him what he read
1855,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He tried to rise to all my speech awoke.
1856,THE KILBOURN ROAD,“A person give me a book a while ago.
1857,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Oh, I donno"
1858,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"The name--the cover’s off. I got, I guess,"
1859,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Two pages done. Time the stock’s fed
1860,THE KILBOURN ROAD,I get so sleepy I jump into bed.”
1861,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"--And with this, for defence, a rueful laugh."
1862,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"I named the town not two miles distant. No,"
1863,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He hardly ever went there. Motion picture show?
1864,THE KILBOURN ROAD,His eyes lit. Several times he’d been.
1865,THE KILBOURN ROAD,War pictures was the best. He liked to kill?
1866,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"He hung his head. “No, but I never will"
1867,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Shoot pups or kittens when they want me to.
1868,THE KILBOURN ROAD,War’s different.” School? He’d seen
1869,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Four years of that--well, four years, more or less."
1870,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Dad needed him--dad had so much to do.
1871,THE KILBOURN ROAD,
1872,THE KILBOURN ROAD,So then I faced him and his need to live.
1873,THE KILBOURN ROAD,I put it plain: “But you?
1874,THE KILBOURN ROAD,What do you want to do?”
1875,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"His answer lay within him, ready made."
1876,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He met my eyes with all he had to give.
1877,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"“I’d like,” he said, “to learn the artist trade.”"
1878,THE KILBOURN ROAD,
1879,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Questioned, he told me bit by little bit."
1880,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He’d had a horse that died--he’d painted her.
1881,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"He’d painted Tige, the dog. The pigeon house."
1882,THE KILBOURN ROAD,The fence that crossed the slough. The willow tree.
1883,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Would he let me see?
1884,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Oh, well--they wasn’t much. He couldn’t stir----"
1885,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"The paint right, and he didn’t have enough."
1886,THE KILBOURN ROAD,All that he’d done was rough.
1887,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"I tried to spell his dream,--to see if his face lit"
1888,THE KILBOURN ROAD,At flame of it.
1889,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He only said: “Mebbe I couldn’t learn.”
1890,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And his eyes did not burn.
1891,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"(“Perhaps,” I thought, “there’s nothing here at all.”)"
1892,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"“Dad’s going to have me paint the house,” he said."
1893,THE KILBOURN ROAD,I questioned where he led.
1894,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"“Yellow and brown,” he answered. And my fancy’s fall"
1895,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He must have fathomed in my face for a slow red
1896,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"Mounted and swept his cheek. His eyes sought mine,"
1897,THE KILBOURN ROAD,His look was piteous with a kind of light.
1898,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"“I don’t like that. They picked it out,” he said. “I wanted white.”"
1899,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And all his tone was shame.
1900,THE KILBOURN ROAD,The craftsman wounded in his craftsman’s right
1901,THE KILBOURN ROAD,In ways he could not name.
1902,THE KILBOURN ROAD,
1903,THE KILBOURN ROAD,He took the cross-road. Where I saw him go
1904,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Wild fever-few made narrow paths of snow
1905,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Through the flat fields of dying afternoon.
1906,THE KILBOURN ROAD,Bravely in tune
1907,THE KILBOURN ROAD,With every little part as with some whole
1908,THE KILBOURN ROAD,A red wing answered to an oriole
1909,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And met a cat bird’s call.
1910,THE KILBOURN ROAD,The sun! The sun! The road to Kilbourn like a long green hall!
1911,THE KILBOURN ROAD,The very air a spirit like our own
1912,THE KILBOURN ROAD,So nearly shown
1913,THE KILBOURN ROAD,That one could almost see.
1914,THE KILBOURN ROAD,The veil so thin that presence was outrayed.
1915,THE KILBOURN ROAD,
1916,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"But all the great blue day came facing me,"
1917,THE KILBOURN ROAD,And crying from the vault and from the sod:
1918,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"“Oh God, oh God."
1919,THE KILBOURN ROAD,"‘_I’d like_,’ he said, ‘_to learn the artist trade!_’”"

1925,VIOLIN,
1926,VIOLIN,One night on some light errand I sat beside
1927,VIOLIN,The cooking-stove in Johann’s sitting-room.
1928,VIOLIN,"Within there was the cheer of lamp and fire,"
1929,VIOLIN,"The stove-draught yawning red and wide,"
1930,VIOLIN,"The table with its rosy cotton spread,"
1931,VIOLIN,"A blue chair-cover from a home-land loom,"
1932,VIOLIN,A baby’s bed.
1933,VIOLIN,And in that odour of cleanliness and food
1934,VIOLIN,"Johann, the labourer worthy of his hire"
1935,VIOLIN,"For seven days a week, twelve hours a day"
1936,VIOLIN,At some vague toil “down in the yard.”
1937,VIOLIN,“Hard?
1938,VIOLIN,What o’ that? Look at the luck I’ve got to keep the place
1939,VIOLIN,And draw my pay.”
1940,VIOLIN,He had been strong
1941,VIOLIN,And still his body kept its ruggedness.
1942,VIOLIN,Yet he was old and stiffened and he moved
1943,VIOLIN,As one who is wrapped round in something thick.
1944,VIOLIN,"But O, his face,"
1945,VIOLIN,His face was like the faces that look out
1946,VIOLIN,"From bark and hole of trees all marred and grooved,"
1947,VIOLIN,All laid about
1948,VIOLIN,With old varieties of silence and of wrong.
1949,VIOLIN,Such faces are locked long
1950,VIOLIN,"In men, in stones, in wood, in earth,"
1951,VIOLIN,Awaiting birth.
1952,VIOLIN,And Johann’s face was less
1953,VIOLIN,Expectant than the happy dead awaiting to become the quick.
1954,VIOLIN,
1955,VIOLIN,His wife said much about how hard she tried.
1956,VIOLIN,She chattered high and shrill
1957,VIOLIN,About the burden and the eating ill.
1958,VIOLIN,"His mother, little, thin, half-blind and cross,"
1959,VIOLIN,"With scarlet flannel round her throat,"
1960,VIOLIN,"Put in her note,"
1961,VIOLIN,"Muttered about the cold, the draught, her side----"
1962,VIOLIN,"Small ineffectual chants of little loss,"
1963,VIOLIN,With never a word
1964,VIOLIN,Of the great gossip which she had not heard:
1965,VIOLIN,That life had passed her by.
1966,VIOLIN,The little room beset me like the din
1967,VIOLIN,And prick of scourges. All
1968,VIOLIN,At once I looked upon the spattered wall
1969,VIOLIN,And saw a violin.
1970,VIOLIN,
1971,VIOLIN,_A hall
1972,VIOLIN,"Vast, bright and breathing."
1973,VIOLIN,In the upper air
1974,VIOLIN,"A chord, a flower of tone, a quiet wreathing"
1975,VIOLIN,Along the lift and fall
1976,VIOLIN,Of some clear current in the blood
1977,VIOLIN,"Now delicately understood,"
1978,VIOLIN,Till all the hearing ones below
1979,VIOLIN,Are where
1980,VIOLIN,The voices call.
1981,VIOLIN,O now they know
1982,VIOLIN,What music is. It is that which they are
1983,VIOLIN,"Themselves. Infinite bells,"
1984,VIOLIN,Of silence in a little sheath. Deep wells
1985,VIOLIN,Of being in a little cup. Star upon star
1986,VIOLIN,Veiled save one reaching ray.
1987,VIOLIN,And see! The people turn
1988,VIOLIN,And for a breath they look
1989,VIOLIN,Out into one another’s eyes
1990,VIOLIN,And shine and burn
1991,VIOLIN,"Wise, wise,"
1992,VIOLIN,With ultimate knowledge of the good
1993,VIOLIN,That seeks one whole.
1994,VIOLIN,And how
1995,VIOLIN,Eternity begins
1996,VIOLIN,And ever is beginning now
1997,VIOLIN,A thousand hearts learn from the violins._
1998,VIOLIN,
1999,VIOLIN,“My back ain’t right. My head ain’t right. I’m almost dead.
2000,VIOLIN,Fill the hot water bag. I’m goin’ to bed....”
2001,VIOLIN,“Ten pairs of socks I’ve darned to-night. I try
2002,VIOLIN,To do the best I can....”
2003,VIOLIN,I put the women by.
2004,VIOLIN,"“Johann,” I said, “you play?” He shook his head."
2005,VIOLIN,"“I lost it, loggin’----” he held up a stump of thumb."
2006,VIOLIN,"“I took six lessons once,” he said."
2007,VIOLIN,"I sat there, dumb."
2008,VIOLIN,
2009,VIOLIN,From out the inner place of music there had come
2010,VIOLIN,"Long long ago,"
2011,VIOLIN,Some viewless one to tell him how to know
2012,VIOLIN,What waits upon the page
2013,VIOLIN,To beat the rhythm of the world. He heard; and tried
2014,VIOLIN,To stumble toward the door graciously wide
2015,VIOLIN,For other feet than his.
2016,VIOLIN,"“I took six lessons once,” he said with pride."
2017,VIOLIN,This
2018,VIOLIN,Was all we gave him of his heritage.

2025,NORTH STAR,His boy had stolen some money from a booth
2026,NORTH STAR,At the County Fair. I found the father in his kitchen.
2027,NORTH STAR,For years he had driven a dray and the heavy lifting
2028,NORTH STAR,Had worn him down. So through his evenings
2029,NORTH STAR,He slept by the kitchen stove as I found him.
2030,NORTH STAR,The mother was crying and ironing.
2031,NORTH STAR,"I thought about the mother,"
2032,NORTH STAR,For she brought me a photograph
2033,NORTH STAR,Taken at a street fair on her wedding day.
2034,NORTH STAR,She was so trim and white and he so neat and alert
2035,NORTH STAR,In the picture with their friends about them----
2036,NORTH STAR,I saw that she wanted me to know their dignity from the first.
2037,NORTH STAR,But afterward I thought more about the father.
2038,NORTH STAR,For as he came with me to the door I could not forbear
2039,NORTH STAR,To say how bright and near the stars seemed.
2040,NORTH STAR,"Then he leaned and peered from beneath his low roof,"

2161,ROSES,"A rose would never admit me, speak to me,"
2162,ROSES,"Listen to me, reply to me, do other than suffer me."
2163,ROSES,But one day after our barbarous fashion I lifted a rose to my face.
2164,ROSES,"Suddenly, thrillingly, the rose replied. It, too, touched at me."
2165,ROSES,We had something to exchange.

2175,SPRING EVENING,I heard her at the telephone.
2176,SPRING EVENING,"“Do come early,” she was saying, “while the light lasts."
2177,SPRING EVENING,"The dog-wood is in blossom, the mountains are wonderful."
2178,SPRING EVENING,"It is,” she said, “too heavenly. Do come, while the light lasts....”"
2179,SPRING EVENING,"Outside on the veranda I could see the light,"
2180,SPRING EVENING,I could see the dog-wood in bloom and a mountain
2181,SPRING EVENING,_And more!_
2182,SPRING EVENING,What else there was I am trying to tell:
2183,SPRING EVENING,Not colour for I am no artist. Not glamour for I am not in love;
2184,SPRING EVENING,Not any more magic than I am accustomed to;
2185,SPRING EVENING,Not presence I think--though perhaps after all it was presence.
2186,SPRING EVENING,"But something else was there, exquisite, insistent."
2187,SPRING EVENING,When she came back I looked up to see if it met her.
2188,SPRING EVENING,But she only said: “It is too heavenly.
2189,SPRING EVENING,I hope they will come while the light lasts.”

2201,SECOND SIGHT,These are not enough for us.

2205,SECOND SIGHT,"Or when the mood changes, motoring down one another’s roads,"

2270,LEVITATION,It seemed as if the wonderful would happen.
2271,LEVITATION,"She waited, prepared for the vision."
2272,LEVITATION,"The day flowered, ripened, mellowed, fell upon night."
2273,LEVITATION,No presence opened or signaled.
2274,LEVITATION,Then she went to embosom that which the hours had left her.
2275,LEVITATION,"She faced her day, and her day gathered itself as a living"
2276,LEVITATION,thing with a voice and deep eyes.
2277,LEVITATION,"It said, I was wonderful."
2278,LEVITATION,
2279,LEVITATION,Yet the only thing to happen that day had been this:
2280,LEVITATION,"Old Edgerton Bascom came to the porch, selling buttons."
2281,LEVITATION,"She bought from him, picked her dahlias for his wife."
2282,LEVITATION,"He went away, comforted, restored to self-respect by her purchase."

2291,ENCHANTMENT,In this house I perform all as seriously as may be required.
2292,ENCHANTMENT,"I accept my desk, my little tools, lamp, paper."
2293,ENCHANTMENT,I write in the one language which I have been taught and
2294,ENCHANTMENT,about the few things with which I am familiar.
2295,ENCHANTMENT,I eat the little round of food which it is said will nourish my body.
2296,ENCHANTMENT,About my books I am docile and I learn from them.
2297,ENCHANTMENT,I look no farther than my window permits.
2298,ENCHANTMENT,When I wish to emerge I go obediently to the door as if
2299,ENCHANTMENT,there were conceivable no other way of exit.
2300,ENCHANTMENT,At night I fall into sleep as if that were eternal purpose.
2301,ENCHANTMENT,
2302,ENCHANTMENT,"I suffer from absence, I submit to distance,"
2303,ENCHANTMENT,"I am subject to innumerable influences,"
2304,ENCHANTMENT,I am open to them all with a sober face.
2305,ENCHANTMENT,
2306,ENCHANTMENT,But all the time I have knowledge that I am something other;
2307,ENCHANTMENT,That all these things shall ultimately have no more power over me.
2308,ENCHANTMENT,That I consent to them because of some delicate exigency
2309,ENCHANTMENT,in this moment of eternity.
2310,ENCHANTMENT,Even now I am often free of them.
2311,ENCHANTMENT,There was the day when I moved among the hills and lost
2312,ENCHANTMENT,every sense of difference from them.
2313,ENCHANTMENT,With the crowning cloud and the far filament of the river
2314,ENCHANTMENT,I found myself in common.
2315,ENCHANTMENT,The air was vocal with all that is identical and in that
2316,ENCHANTMENT,hour it offered to me my identity.
2317,ENCHANTMENT,I became everything. I had no question to ask for it was
2318,ENCHANTMENT,"I, too, who was answering."
2319,ENCHANTMENT,The hour dissolved. The ultimate star was my neighbour.
2320,ENCHANTMENT,
2321,ENCHANTMENT,... Suddenly I remembered myself down in the valley moving
2322,ENCHANTMENT,about in a house.
