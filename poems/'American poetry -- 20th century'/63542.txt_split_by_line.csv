64,CENTURY EPIC,Preface
65,CENTURY EPIC,
66,CENTURY EPIC,By the Author.
67,CENTURY EPIC,
68,CENTURY EPIC,
69,CENTURY EPIC,"This poem that I have dignified with the term epic, was written by"
70,CENTURY EPIC,"inspiration, and is dedicated to the human race. I have used the term"
71,CENTURY EPIC,epic with no intention of assuming a dignity not due my production;
72,CENTURY EPIC,"but, in the sense that the precepts and warnings contained therein,"
73,CENTURY EPIC,have a lofty purpose; and are graphically set forth in the plainest
74,CENTURY EPIC,words in the English language.
75,CENTURY EPIC,
76,CENTURY EPIC,I have not indulged in similes or hyperboles; nor does my epic abound
77,CENTURY EPIC,"with those picturesque figures of comparison found in Homer or Virgil,"
78,CENTURY EPIC,"nor those cadences and swells found in The Paradise Lost, describing"
79,CENTURY EPIC,the headlong falls and gigantic flights of those god-like personages
80,CENTURY EPIC,peopling the heavens and earth in the poetic mind; nor does my
81,CENTURY EPIC,inspiration come from muse or divine breath; nor did it descend upon
82,CENTURY EPIC,"me from above; on the contrary, it sprang up out of the deep feeling I"
83,CENTURY EPIC,"have for my kind, especially those in the strained walks of life."
84,CENTURY EPIC,
85,CENTURY EPIC,Our twentieth century shows society in the process of centralizing
86,CENTURY EPIC,"itself; and, gradually forcing us into legal socialism. This is"
87,CENTURY EPIC,"plainly shown in the poem. The process of centralization, for years,"
88,CENTURY EPIC,worked slowly in this country. As long as the influence of the founders
89,CENTURY EPIC,"of our Republic was potent, liberty was dominant."
90,CENTURY EPIC,
91,CENTURY EPIC,The first step in this process was the inauguration of a general system
92,CENTURY EPIC,of free public schools. The direct result of this free education was to
93,CENTURY EPIC,overcrowd the book and head portion of our population at the expense
94,CENTURY EPIC,"of the producing classes, making it harder for the clerk to make a"
95,CENTURY EPIC,bare living. The idea of every parent now seems to be that his or her
96,CENTURY EPIC,offspring is especially adapted to the learned professions and to
97,CENTURY EPIC,society.
98,CENTURY EPIC,
99,CENTURY EPIC,This was also the first step towards the diversion of public funds to
100,CENTURY EPIC,private enterprise. The appropriation of public moneys to the extensive
101,CENTURY EPIC,and widening fields of private affairs has progressed rapidly in the
102,CENTURY EPIC,"last decade. This, with its evils, is vividly set forth in my poem."
103,CENTURY EPIC,"Unless this is checked by united, immediate action, socialism will"
104,CENTURY EPIC,"increase more rapidly in the future than in the past, is my prophecy."
105,CENTURY EPIC,This results from the fact that the tax-eaters are the ones who
106,CENTURY EPIC,manipulate our bond elections.
107,CENTURY EPIC,
108,CENTURY EPIC,"The result is plain, and can be predicted with certainty; the end of"
109,CENTURY EPIC,"socialism will be the extreme opposite and, that you all know is"
110,CENTURY EPIC,"anarchy. When everything is so striking that nothing strikes, or in"
111,CENTURY EPIC,"other words, when there are more laws than we can possibly tolerate,"
112,CENTURY EPIC,"we’ll naturally rebel and kick them all over; all, as shown in this"
113,CENTURY EPIC,epic. The last transition will likely be accomplished by bloodshed and
114,CENTURY EPIC,strife.
115,CENTURY EPIC,
116,CENTURY EPIC,The laws for the management of society in a state of complete legal
117,CENTURY EPIC,socialism will be so numerous and complicated; and the bureaus so
118,CENTURY EPIC,"haughty and domineering that freemen will not try to learn them, much"
119,CENTURY EPIC,"less obey them. In fact, no one can now keep pace with the rapid"
120,CENTURY EPIC,production of laws under our incipient socialism. The fight I make is
121,CENTURY EPIC,"to break off now and go back to fundamentals, as shown in my poem."
122,CENTURY EPIC,
123,CENTURY EPIC,"As against socialism or anarchy I deliberately prefer the latter; but,"
124,CENTURY EPIC,"as against both of them I prefer a government of limited powers, based"
125,CENTURY EPIC,exclusively on natural laws that I have so forcibly defined in this
126,CENTURY EPIC,work; with a complete abandonment of the barbarous idea of punishment
127,CENTURY EPIC,for crimes by criminal courts; the man who commits a crime is to be
128,CENTURY EPIC,"pitied and helped to a more sane mode of existence, and not be driven"
129,CENTURY EPIC,into perpetual criminality. As to how he shall be handled can be better
130,CENTURY EPIC,settled when we clear ourselves of our false notions on the subject.
131,CENTURY EPIC,
132,CENTURY EPIC,"Our legal servants, we call officers, are now deteriorating with great"
133,CENTURY EPIC,"rapidity, as set forth in this poem under “Names.” My remedy for that"
134,CENTURY EPIC,"is to cut down the salaries of all officers from President down, so low"
135,CENTURY EPIC,that no one will seek office for money. Then have the laws such that
136,CENTURY EPIC,"men will be selected and compelled to serve, by public sentiment, for"
137,CENTURY EPIC,short terms and take out part of their pay in patriotism and good will.
138,CENTURY EPIC,
139,CENTURY EPIC,"My observation, over a number of years, shows that the higher the"
140,CENTURY EPIC,"salary, the more inefficient the officer. High salaries also give birth"
141,CENTURY EPIC,to gangs of politicians who fatten off the public funds and salaries of
142,CENTURY EPIC,"their appointees, making graft semi-respectable."
143,CENTURY EPIC,
144,CENTURY EPIC,Honesty in public and private life seems to me to be very desirable;
145,CENTURY EPIC,"and, it could be so easily attained, as set forth in my epic. Of"
146,CENTURY EPIC,"course, under our prevailing system, honesty is out of the question;"
147,CENTURY EPIC,"and if any of you think that I have not convicted you of dishonesty,"
148,CENTURY EPIC,"as defined under that topic, please send me your photograph to be used"
149,CENTURY EPIC,herein.
150,CENTURY EPIC,
151,CENTURY EPIC,In writing this poem I have no malice in my heart for a single human
152,CENTURY EPIC,"being on earth; and, if in any way I have touched upon any of your"
153,CENTURY EPIC,"pet notions or sacred ideas, and thereby wounded your feelings, I"
154,CENTURY EPIC,sincerely ask your forgiveness; with me all truth is sacred. I have no
155,CENTURY EPIC,"ill-will against preachers, lawyers, or doctors; I wrote you up to make"
156,CENTURY EPIC,"you think, and also to let you know you were not fooling me."
157,CENTURY EPIC,
158,CENTURY EPIC,"In conclusion, I say to you one and all, as brothers and fellow"
159,CENTURY EPIC,"citizens, let’s work together to save the greatest country and the"
160,CENTURY EPIC,greatest civilization on earth.
161,CENTURY EPIC,
162,CENTURY EPIC,"Let truth together bind us,"
163,CENTURY EPIC,And supporting it find us.

168,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
169,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
170,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
171,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
172,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Proem
173,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
174,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
175,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I never shall appeal to any muse of old
176,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To give inspiration to my story when it’s told,"
177,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But, in words all my own, shall my theme unfold;"
178,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, for my love of man, I’ll tell you what I can;"
179,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Tell you what I know that you may truly scan
180,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,What to do and what to know for the good of man;
181,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Tell you where to go, the places you should shun"
182,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On every working day, when your labor’s done."
183,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In telling where to go I will not name the place
184,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where you should show your face, but let each run his race"
185,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, for himself decide the spot to cast his lot."
186,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I’ll point out mistakes to help put on brakes
187,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Against the evils of our day one often makes.
188,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From the Charlatan and all designing wise
189,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Strip his robe of guise and expose him to your eyes.
190,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The fawning sycophant and all his crafty kind
191,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Will be painted so they’ll not be hard to find.
192,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I’ll speak of laws and customs old with hoary age
193,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Taught by rulers, priests, and many an ancient sage"
194,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That now are practically extinct with non-usage;
195,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And regulations new that men had little to do
196,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With bribes sometimes when they put them through
197,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Legislative halls and Congress we’d now eschew.
198,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I’ll speak to you about your manners
199,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When you sometimes march with banners;
200,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And even with hosannas sitting meekly in your pew
201,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Revolving schemes against others you intend to do.
202,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The roving politicians all seeking fat positions
203,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To feed their hungry maws and all their kin-in-laws
204,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Come in for their share when we divide the flaws.
205,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Even the society genteel in their swift automobile
206,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Had better beware their piccadillos to conceal.
207,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Religions of every shade by ancients and moderns made
208,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To subdue the gentle folk with all that they have said
209,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This subject will meet its due before I’m through,"
210,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As I started out for things about that need review.
211,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Theatres too, with music, painting and art,"
212,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Might all feel slighted not to have their part
213,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the criticism we bring as they my song may sing;
214,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And the pictures my word recalls may be carved on walls
215,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the coming days as was done with other poet’s lays.
216,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Developments in science where we place reliance
217,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To alleviate the misdirection of our state
218,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Should all be alluded to in the story we relate.
219,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Wars, with all their frightful havoc spread"
220,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where victorious and routed passed over dying and dead,"
221,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And peace too that came at last
222,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That o’er the earth its healing blessings amassed
223,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Should have a place when in plates my work is cast;
224,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Also ethics, that practical theme so misunderstood,"
225,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Should here be elucidated for the general good;
226,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And a few short digressions would not be out of place
227,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In an Epic dedicated to and written for The Human Race.
228,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But what is said under each head you may read,"
229,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So to my task the work shall proceed.
230,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
231,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
232,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
233,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
234,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Admonition
235,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
236,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
237,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Take from your statute laws and books
238,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All legal protection for thieves and crooks;
239,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your complicated bills of mechanics’ liens
240,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That offer to rogues the ample means
241,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The owners of houses with their demesnes
242,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To make go down humbly into their jeans
243,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For the jingly coin doubly to pay
244,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The working man, and padded expenses defray."
245,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your unjust schemes of municipal taxation
246,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That cause home owners such great vexation.
247,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Your tax upon mortgages, bills and notes"
248,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Upon which the poor man’s title barely floats,"
249,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Causing him to pay levies upon his lands
250,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As if they were clear like the rich man’s;
251,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By increasing for him his interest and dues
252,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which the money sharks collect as they choose.
253,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your laws against usury one may take
254,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Tend solely the poor man’s back to break.
255,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You drive away the cheap money he might get,"
256,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And leave him at the mercy of that lawless set
257,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who fatten upon unfortunates suddenly thrown in debt.
258,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Nearly all your laws for the collection of dues
259,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Into our commercial life dishonesty infuse.
260,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Your regulations of homestead, exemption and stay"
261,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Simply postpone our troubles to another day.
262,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By intricate trials with their writs and pleas;
263,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And copious objections about titles and fees,"
264,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Remainders absolute, contingent and entailed,"
265,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon technicalities numberless justice is impaled;
266,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Your instructions, your errors and appeals,"
267,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Until the waiting, anxious litigant feels"
268,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That the door of the temple of justice is locked;
269,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And his chance of right is securely blocked.
270,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Your free legal aid and your festive welfare board,"
271,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Their matrons and clerks, a mighty hungry hoard,"
272,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Impose upon the payers of taxes a weighty load;
273,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All for the purpose of sending over the road
274,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some unfortunate victim of their own slimy graft
275,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or some poor devil whom they kick “fore and aft.”
276,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Your Juvenile court of which the kids make sport,"
277,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where curtailed haired women and men hold the fort.
278,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And such institutions the wits of man can devise
279,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are considered by Progressives as blessings in disguise.
280,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your tariffs for protection passed in Congress halls
281,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To build all around us mighty Chinese walls,"
282,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Are sapping from the people their dear blood of life,"
283,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And making for politicians no end of deadly strife.
284,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your proctor with his aids to fight against divorce;
285,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who by his pugnacity is seeking to enforce
286,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Unfortunate couples bound in unhappy wedded lock
287,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To parade their troubles upon the public dock;
288,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And to bind the chains anew they seek to dissever,"
289,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Holding them fast that he may be deemed clever,"
290,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the estimation of all the Christian Endeavor;
291,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And that class of persons who want now and forever
292,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To meddle in the affairs of all whomsoever
293,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are not able to disclaim the care they obtain;
294,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who crowd upon the weak the blessings they do not seek;
295,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All to achieve for themselves a home in the sky
296,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When from their missions on earth they fly.
297,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The Commissioners of Vice are pulling for a slice
298,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of fame as it goes by investigating those
299,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who employ many girls simply to keep them in hose
300,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And such other fancy articles that they suppose
301,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Will always make them shine when they go out to dine,"
302,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As a girl dressed up haply feels fine.
303,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And now here comes Teddy with his big stick and hat
304,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For damages to his soiled name in legal spat,"
305,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With a small newspaper man suing for a big chunk
306,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because he published that T. R. had been drunk.
307,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To tell the names of men who are shams in our times
308,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Would overload my epic with variegated rhymes:
309,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The one named above is more than a man;
310,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He stands for ideas, a party and a clan"
311,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Born of disappointment and just turned loose
312,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Sailing under the banner of the Big Bull Moose.
313,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This clique of theirs all swelling up to burst
314,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Decry all our institutions to be the very worst.
315,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They’d have our laws, judges and courts recalled,"
316,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And others to suit them forthwith installed.
317,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They’d regulate the wages men have to pay,"
318,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Neglecting to tell the laborer he might be in the way
319,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Unless his work he did should his employers pay;
320,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For unless his production his pay did compensate
321,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He and others would soon be off the slate.
322,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They told us too in tones as loud as they could prate
323,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"How all the monied men and trusts they’d regulate,"
324,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Carefully hiding the man who was running their slate,"
325,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And supplying the funds for them to navigate.
326,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The working man too his dinner pail they’d fill
327,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Forgetting also to tell him to send in his bill.
328,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They’d secure to all the women free right to vote,"
329,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So they could say to hubby: “We’ve got your goat.”
330,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And volumes of such ideas upon us did they float
331,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All too numerous in this article to quote.
332,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Drop your silly custom not worn off by growth
333,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That judicial bodies must put a witness to oath,"
334,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That all he says and all that he shall quote
335,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Will be the truth and nothing but the truth,"
336,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About the matters he relates in his witness booth.
337,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The reasons for this habit have long passed forsooth,"
338,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It deceives none on bench or in jury box;
339,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It may occasionally aid some old, designing fox"
340,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To some youthful, verdant judge deceive"
341,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, of some just debt himself relieve."
342,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On the whole, it does more harm than good"
343,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As at present the thing is generally understood:
344,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For in a contested suit with one who knows
345,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Against a trembly one who partially shows
346,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some lingering faith in “Old Scare Crows,”"
347,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The inclination to lie and deceive in the one
348,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Would surely be by the other simply outdone:
349,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The one might be bound by the fears of hell
350,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While the other swears away his lies to tell.
351,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When the witness swears he’s perjured unawares,"
352,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For by his plight he must the whole truth reveal
353,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By the rule he must more than half conceal.
354,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Stop your fight for prohibition and do the fair thing;
355,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Our people to temperance themselves will shortly bring.
356,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Take taxes off whisky, wine, liquor and beer;"
357,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, for the cause of temperance you needn’t have a fear."
358,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let all your marts and markets freely sell
359,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Every kind of liquor they ever heard tell;
360,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let every one the stuff make from gulf to lake;
361,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Make the price so cheap that with one leap,"
362,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Men will forsake the common thing to keep.
363,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,At one cent a drink the bar keeper will think
364,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,His saloon will sink and soon put him on the brink
365,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of finding some other way all his expenses to pay;
366,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So out soon he goes not stopping his doors to close.
367,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"There still will be drinking and that keeps you thinking,"
368,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That by compulsion you can create a revulsion
369,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the taste of man heap sooner than you can.
370,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The truth is, you’ve always tried in vain"
371,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All these cultivated tastes of man to restrain.
372,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The more you try to force men good habits to acquire,"
373,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The more you stir up and increase his raging desire,"
374,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To show his freedom against which you conspire.
375,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He’ll go to any extent which you’ll never prevent,"
376,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To get his booze on which his mind is bent;
377,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He’ll keep his “blind tigers” and his wooden legs,"
378,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Hollowed out and neatly made with faucet of pegs,"
379,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,His whisky he’ll conceal and feel he’s in the right;
380,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So you’ll not stop him no matter how you fight.
381,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The drunkard will drink no matter what you think,"
382,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,At any cost no matter if you consider him lost.
383,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Make the price so cheap that for his family’s keep,"
384,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He’ll still be ahead to buy his folks their bread.

389,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A Digression
390,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
391,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
392,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I used to tell my friends what I was going to do,"
393,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And right away they’d say, “I wouldn’t if I were you.”"
394,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I know of once or twice by taking their advice,"
395,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A good deal I lost at a distressing cost.
396,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Take my advice; choose your own course to pursue,"
397,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, when you get your plan, just put it through,"
398,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And then tell no other man what you’ve been up to.
399,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then if you succeed you will never need,"
400,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Anybody else to claim part of your deed.
401,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Even if you fail, don’t furl up your sail"
402,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nor put your head under the bottom rail,"
403,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But try once more just the same as before.

410,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Dorothy
411,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
412,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
413,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Listen to this story about a little girl,"
414,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who came into the world a short time ago.
415,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I remember the day, only a few months or so;"
416,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It was in the month of March over a year;
417,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When all trembling with hope and fear,"
418,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We did for her watch--all sincere.
419,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"At night she came, and without any name,"
420,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because we did not know what her sex would be;
421,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But at her scream, the doctor said “she”;"
422,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, then, we all at once knew what to do;"
423,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About naming her the course to pursue.
424,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We left it to her mother, herself a little bride,"
425,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This weighty matter of naming all to decide.
426,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We told her all the names we did hear or see,"
427,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But she rejected them all and called her Dorothy.
428,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So Dorothy’s my theme her grandmother’s dream,"
429,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"During all those years when those babes of hers,"
430,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Us did come to see, and, now she still avers,"
431,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That she watched through the passing years
432,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Looking to see if one of hers a girl might be,"
433,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But they were boys, the whole blessed three."
434,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Now Dorothy’s here to fill our home with cheer
435,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By her little, prattling talk and her shambling walk,"
436,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By her little tricks she plays in her winning ways,"
437,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Pulling off your hat and fumbling your cravat,"
438,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Knocking over chairs, trying to go upstairs,"
439,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Picking all the flowers for grandpa to smell,"
440,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And more other things than tongue or pen can tell.
441,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,She’s a little sprite and good for our sight.
442,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But here I must pause and sadly say,"
443,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That one evil day a swelling came on her neck,"
444,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We thought for sure had come from us to take
445,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The little brat, and all our hearts to break."
446,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But the good doctor came and now she’s the same
447,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As she was before the blasted swelling came.
448,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,May I never see the day till my race on earth is run
449,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When any evil at all shall befall this little one.
450,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Many of you have plenty of such chaps,"
451,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That jump up and down upon your laps,"
452,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who are just as pretty and just as sweet;
453,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And you walk with them upon the street,"
454,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To the market and to the drug store,"
455,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where you buy food stuffs for them galore,"
456,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Just the same as I do for mine o’er and o’er.
457,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But still with me a great difference I see,"
458,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Between your brats and my Dorothy,"
459,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And the reason that you do not with me agree
460,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is simply because you are you and I am me.
461,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
462,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
463,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
464,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
465,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Divorce
466,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
467,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
468,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now drop a little tear, but don’t stop here,"
469,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Come along now and let’s see if we can agree
470,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon another matter while o’er the thing I scatter
471,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some thoughts I have, not intending myself to flatter."
472,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Divorce is a question about which many disagree;
473,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some think it’s wrong; some think it’s right maybe.
474,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Now upon it let’s begin our wordy fight and see.
475,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For a beginning I will postulate, simply to open the debate,"
476,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That it is not an affair of the state that couples separate,"
477,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When they each other fervently hate;
478,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Except where children, a care about whose fate,"
479,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On the conscience of the public might grate,"
480,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are brought into court for the judge to state
481,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In his judicial opinion of the case,"
482,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,What he considers best for the human race.
483,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then of course if His Honor is wise, he’ll devise"
484,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some plan to make wife and man either realize,"
485,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That if they are deaf to the cries of their offspring
486,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The court itself will bring pressure into the thing
487,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They’re about to do, and, before it gets through,"
488,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I think that neither me nor you will any suggestion make
489,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or advice give about what course the law will take.
490,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If when all this is done and the court can’t make them one,"
491,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Then it is up to him and all my talk is done.
492,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some people oppose divorce on account of their views,"
493,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Acquired from that book written by ancient Jews.
494,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some think it a disgrace upon the entire human race,"
495,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For any sundered couples to have a place,"
496,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,On the green earth where they may show their face.
497,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This narrow view is not entertained by you or me,"
498,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because we’ve been along far enough to see
499,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some of the things from whom some are set free.
500,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Others oppose it on the score of “I told you so!
501,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,People oughtn’t marry whom they did not know.”
502,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some plunge deep into the matter, themselves they flatter,"
503,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That they can some great big principles scatter,"
504,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Over the very causes while they chatter.
505,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They’d take it in time and let the big state
506,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Issue its own red-sealed certificate,"
507,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To all spooning couples longing to mate,"
508,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, at one single throw the entire nuisance abate."
509,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then these smart ones pucker their mouth,"
510,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With their heads tossed north and south,"
511,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To see if anybody should really act so shoddy,"
512,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As not an acquiescent head to at once noddy.
513,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But the main fight does not come from home,"
514,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It thunders from the pope of Rome;
515,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, there are plenty of folks take his word home."
516,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He says marriage is the sacred thing of life,"
517,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And when one takes a wife, regardless of strife,"
518,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They cannot be cut apart with a butcher’s knife.
519,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So you may shake this subject up and down,"
520,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In country, village and town, and use every noun,"
521,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Verb, adverb and pronoun from early morn to sundown,"
522,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the people will no better be made, for all your"
523,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Prattle and all you said.
524,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The real causes of the thing are ingrain,"
525,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Born in the heart and born in the brain,"
526,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Maybe, by any by, before you die, but not I,"
527,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Science may teach us to create and the race propagate,"
528,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In some other way besides this vexing marriage state.
529,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,

532,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
533,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Social Evil
534,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
535,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
536,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The next subject allied the last, on to which"
537,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I have been trying my train of thoughts to switch,"
538,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is one to which a common word is applied,"
539,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That just as well fits many other things beside;
540,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But the meaning of which comes easily when tried;
541,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And seems to pop into your heads with no upheaval,"
542,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is that natural crime called “the social evil.”
543,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now, I did not make people and neither did you,"
544,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But if a certain inspired book be true,"
545,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some one made man for a start,"
546,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And then chopped out him a piece near his heart,"
547,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And constructed another of a little different sort.
548,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If this be true the “some one” must be divinity
549,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For, ever since, there has been a mysterious affinity,"
550,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Between the two kinds in every community.
551,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On this subject we must not too widely roam,"
552,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Because it might bring some trouble home,"
553,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To some of you married men who every now and then
554,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Feel like jumping out of your own pen.
555,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Legislation and investigation and even humiliation,"
556,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Over all creation, in homes of every station,"
557,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Among peoples of every tribe and nation,"
558,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Have to this offense brought emancipation.
559,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Women have been burned at the stake,"
560,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In attempting to make them forsake,"
561,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The lives they were leading, the men they were bleeding."
562,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In all your statute books, in corners and nooks,"
563,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Laws have been framed against every thing that looks
564,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Towards countenancing any form of prostitution:
565,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Yet with all this and your contribution,"
566,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In your vain attempts to revise the constitution
567,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of woman and man ever since the world began,"
568,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You have not yet laid the foundation
569,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For killing this wicked institution.
570,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You have tried segregation into dark streets,"
571,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where your own policemen lose their beats;
572,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You have tried fines in the police courts,"
573,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where they fetch up all the regular sports;
574,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You have even gone yourself among the slums;
575,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And feigned to be treating them as your chums,"
576,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Doing your levelest to put them under your thumbs,"
577,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And yet this evil does not seem to succumb;
578,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now what can we do but to stop trying,"
579,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And to our several good wives lying
580,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About where we’ve been now and then.
581,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You let this subject alone and stay at home
582,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As much as you can for the good of man.
583,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The more you talk and act wise,"
584,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The more you’ll advertise the thing to eyes
585,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That see and ears that hear
586,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When you think no eavesdropper is near.

592,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
593,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
594,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As my train of thought rumbled over the
595,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Last topic it nearly tumbled;
596,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, metre, I see, was hard to gee:"
597,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But the subject next calling for my attention,"
598,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Has me so perplexed that I scarcely can mention
599,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Even the little that I know and the facts show
600,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About woman suffrage more than you already know.
601,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because I once rode with Phoebe Cousins
602,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And have read suffrage pieces by dozens;
603,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I’ve even heard Susan B. at the time that she
604,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Her speeches did make our customs to break,"
605,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And yet, with all of that, little is under my hat,"
606,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To enlighten you or tell you where I’m at
607,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon this subject great where women of late
608,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their rights to get are defying the state.
609,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In Old Great Britt’n many of ’em are sitt’n
610,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Starving in jails sooner than lower their sails.
611,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But, considering it all, it looks to me,"
612,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That if you make your ballots universally free
613,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To every living man who on top of earth walks
614,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And to every single, solitary woman who talks"
615,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You wouldn’t help us much to get us out of the clutch
616,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of bad laws passed and the evil designing of such
617,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As our liberties would take to--beat the Dutch.
618,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,

620,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,

622,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Honesty
623,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
624,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
625,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If in all your acquaintance, you know an honest man,"
626,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Produce him and introduce him to me if you can,"
627,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That I may get the likeness of his face
628,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To emboss in gold for a model to the human race;
629,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In my epic I’ll give him a prominent place.
630,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now, don’t get miffed at me, till my meaning you see"
631,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And my definition you fully understand of honesty.
632,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I can find plenty of people anywhere
633,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who will not lie like a tiger in his lair,"
634,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Ready to pounce upon you, your neck to break,"
635,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your horse to steal and your watch to take;
636,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who will not break into your house at night,"
637,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And commit burglary without any light;
638,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or in your pocket slip his slimy hands
639,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To snake out your money where he stands;
640,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or who will not murder, rob and plunder"
641,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or steal your child your roof from under;
642,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or who will not commit any of your crimes
643,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And pay all that they owe, even to dimes"
644,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And contracts keep square within the lines;
645,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And yet none of these come up you see,"
646,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To my idea of what true honesty must be.
647,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Now an honest man will strictly follow facts
648,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In every thing he thinks, believes, or acts;"
649,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When he knows the truth that will guide his way.
650,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where there are no winding paths for him to stray.
651,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He will not suppress the evidence in a case,"
652,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where some gain may come to him in his race
653,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For gold, ambition, pride, or even grace."
654,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Without uttering a word, the biggest lie ever heard,"
655,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"May fly out with wings of the fleetest bird,"
656,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And in its wake its venom shake over our heads,"
657,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Bringing distress and grief its desolation sheds.
658,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By simple look, wink, or nod of the head,"
659,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We give assent to whatever is said;
660,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And in that way push falsehood straight ahead.
661,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nothing at all may be asked, no inquiry made,"
662,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Still we should tell about the horse we trade;
663,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If any faults he have, ring bone, spavin joint,"
664,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Pole evil, swinny or any other weak point,"
665,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We should spit it out right away
666,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And not wait for the other fellow to say.
667,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If a house you have to sell where one must dwell,"
668,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Tell about the plumbing and everything as well,"
669,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That makes your house unsuited to him you’d sell.
670,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If pastor of some orthodox church you may be;
671,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And find things in the Bible that can’t agree
672,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With reason and sense, don’t get upon your knee"
673,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And pray grace to help you see that two equals three.
674,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Speak the truth, lose your job and stay free."
675,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When you go upon the street and a stranger meet
676,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who seems to know you, don’t be so sweet,"
677,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And claim to know his face while you greet.
678,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When dressed up in your only Sunday suit
679,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That some one admires, don’t begin to hoot"
680,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That it is only your old every-day suit.
681,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When asked a simple question you cannot answer
682,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t say that you’ve just forgot and be a romancer,"
683,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Come out with the truth, say you don’t know."
684,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When inquiry is made as to what church you go,"
685,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If you don’t go to any, just say so;"
686,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Don’t pretend that you go to different ones
687,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“You know.”
688,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If you’re running a bank and get short on cash
689,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where to extend accommodation might cause a smash,"
690,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t squint your goggled eyes and look wise,"
691,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And claim that you’re moving the crop, otherwise,"
692,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You’d be too glad to take a loan of that size.
693,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you are specially invited to play or sing,"
694,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And are pining to hear your own piano ring
695,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t say that you’re out of practice here of late,"
696,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When you’ve done nothing but practice for that date.
697,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If some one cordially asks you to have a drink,"
698,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t tell him that you, yourself, was on the brink"
699,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of inviting him with you in a social glass to link.
700,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When you have old clothes lying on the floor
701,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That you are about to hand over to the poor,"
702,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t pretend that you’ve them simply outgrown,"
703,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When in the rag-bag they’ve actually been thrown.
704,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When some dear friend implores you for a ten
705,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t pull your coin case where money had been,"
706,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As if he didn’t know where your full bill book stayed,"
707,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In your hip pocket crammed, the bills nicely laid."
708,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When in your swift automobile you ride,"
709,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t ask any one to sit by your side,"
710,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Ride by yourself and flatter your pride,"
711,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That everybody’s observing how slick you glide.
712,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you get on your new spring hat and green cravat,"
713,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t break your back trying to be so straight,"
714,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But let modesty all your demeanor regulate.
715,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t feel so grand, and swagger as you go"
716,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Forgetting to whom for those things you owe.
717,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You are dishonest in the way you treat your wife;
718,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You go to clubs and revel in high life;
719,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You smoke, chew and drink to your full,"
720,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While she stays at home the baby buggy to pull.
721,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You go outing and have a jolly time;
722,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, when you start out, you flip her a dime;"
723,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you do hand out a ten her things to buy,"
724,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You pull it out slow and heave a deep sigh,"
725,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And before you leave you almost make her cry,"
726,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Saying so very much about hard times being nigh;
727,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If you ever spend a dollar freely in your life
728,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let it be the dollar you deliver to your wife.
729,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sling it out and say, “Money grows on trees!”"
730,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If she wants more you’ll dash it to the breeze.
731,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You don’t always tell your wife where you’ve been,"
732,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And I don’t advise you to, for I don’t begin"
733,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To tell mine all the places where I go
734,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And the reasons for which I’ll never show.
735,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You are dishonest in listing for your tax,"
736,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In giving in notes and bonds hid away in cracks;
737,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And the value of your things you put so low
738,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That when th’ assessor’s gone you don’t know
739,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where you’ll get your next meal, so poor you feel."
740,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you take your seat on the witness stool,"
741,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And swallow that solemn oath under the court rule,"
742,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The things that help your case, your lawyer told,"
743,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In your memory seem to stay with an iron hold;
744,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But those circumstances that against you militate
745,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Appear entirely faded off your memory plate.
746,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A falsehood acted, spoken, thought or believed"
747,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Seems justifiable when the one by it deceived
748,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Had no right to elicit the truth from you,"
749,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And with the matter in dispute had nothing to do;
750,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But was merely intermeddling, taking in the view"
751,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of people’s affairs to glut his curious mind
752,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And get into trouble if the same he’d find.
753,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of all the animals on earth we find anywhere
754,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Man’s the only dishonest one I do declare,"
755,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Unless the fox be called dishonest when to lead
756,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The howling pack off his track, he runs at full speed,"
757,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And turns around and comes back over the same track
758,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And then quickly darts off somewhere to hide,"
759,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"While the hounds on the old straight track relied,"
760,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And bound ahead beyond where the fox turned back,"
761,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Thinking he’s gone on and thus lose the track.
762,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This clever deceit is accomplished so neat,"
763,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By the sly little fox who is hard to beat.
764,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You may take the meanest horse any day,"
765,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"While munching away on his bale of hay,"
766,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And he’ll kick, bite, and run all the others away,"
767,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Until he gets his belly full, when he leaves"
768,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And lets the others eat the rest of the sheaves;
769,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And doesn’t lock them up in a safety deposit box.
770,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When a man’s wants are supplied, he locks"
771,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Up from all others the things he cannot use,"
772,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If he lived a thousand years his stomach to abuse.
773,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Civilization made us dishonest, nature never did;"
774,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Deceit comes from cultivation and we’ll never rid
775,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Ourselves from its blighting evils till we undo
776,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Many of our laws and customs made and passed by you.
777,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Man could be made honest in a very few years,"
778,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If he could be held respectable among his peers;
779,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But if one of us should get honest all at once,"
780,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We’d be hauled up for being a dunce;
781,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, an inquisition had to ascertain whether we’re mad."
782,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Our behavior would to others seem so queer,"
783,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That they would flee from us in bodily fear.
784,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So we will have to let reformation work slow,"
785,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Until the full meaning of my epic you know.

790,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Jim Saltenstall
791,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
792,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,(A Digression.)
793,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
794,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
795,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A certain man, stout and medium tall"
796,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Dwelt near us once, named Jim Saltenstall."
797,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The most peculiar thing about this man,"
798,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Was not his name nor distended span.
799,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A powerful limb was he of the law,"
800,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In which he exercised his massive jaw,"
801,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In justice courts if chance he saw,"
802,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To display his wit or pick a flaw,"
803,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In some contention neighbors hate,"
804,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where he was ready and never too late,"
805,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To get a V for his windy prate.
806,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A farm beside, where he did reside,"
807,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Claimed his skill and special pride.
808,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He handled stock and rode his nag,"
809,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And had many things about which to brag.
810,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In cows and swine his money he stuck
811,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To raise for profit and keep him up.
812,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The clothes he wore hung on him loose,"
813,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Except when he did faultlessly spruce
814,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Before his friends and neighbors to strut
815,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In court, to pull his client out of a rut."
816,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He had one pair of extra sized pants,"
817,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Made by a cousin or one of his aunts,"
818,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Known all around by every girl and boy,"
819,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In his vicinity, made of brown corduroy."
820,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This pair loose he’d usually wear
821,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With no chance for the brush to tear.
822,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"One sultry afternoon in the middle of June,"
823,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A couple of spinsters riding along soon
824,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Discovered on one side of the road
825,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This pair of pants where it was “throwed.”
826,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As they drew up close to the spot
827,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their nag whirled around in a trot;
828,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The pants were moving and jumping about
829,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,These maids their wits scaring half out.
830,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"No James was by them seen at all,"
831,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But they knew the trousers of Saltenstall,"
832,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who had hid in weeds with none on at all.
833,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This mystery to them riding in the lane,"
834,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He never appeared and offered to explain.
835,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Weeks passed by before they laid eye
836,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Upon Saltenstall for whom they did spy,"
837,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This vision and its meaning to reveal.
838,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They imagined they heard pigs squeal,"
839,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So by ifs and whats and twisting twigs,"
840,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They guessed the pants were full of pigs.
841,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This story is true, and the riddle plain:"
842,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"James found in his pasture near the lane,"
843,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That his favorite sow the stork had blessed,"
844,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With a litter of pigs, so he was distressed,"
845,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To contrive a scheme to take pigs to barn,"
846,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And have them housed and shielded from harm.
847,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"No sack had he in which to fetch the pigs,"
848,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So these pants were used with his rigs.
849,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When on his shoulders his pigs he did load,"
850,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In plain view he saw the maids in the road.
851,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They were coming straight ahead in full view,"
852,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So off his shoulders the whole thing he threw,"
853,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And took to the weeds to get out of view.
854,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"These ladies came along, all as we have said,"
855,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And found matters as stated under this head.
856,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
857,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
858,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
859,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
860,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Science
861,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
862,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
863,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We do not mean by the title above,"
864,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Christian Science, which so many love;"
865,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, against which we have no thought to inveigh,"
866,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Because it is accomplishing some good in its day,"
867,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By teaching us to see that the power of the mind
868,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Controls our bodies more than others find.
869,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By science, we mean all knowledge gained"
870,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From whatever source it may be attained;
871,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By inventions, laws, medicine, therapeutics,"
872,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sociology, geology, astronomy, epizootics,"
873,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Geography, orthography, mentality, logics,"
874,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Government, devilment, war and fratricide;"
875,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And this list might be multiplied if we tried.
876,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But of all those things we cannot make review.
877,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For ages men did not know that the earth was round;
878,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It was supposed to flat, and all the ground"
879,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Rested on the back of one man, whose picture is found"
880,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Still in old geographies, standing under his load,"
881,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With his feet upon the back of some large toad,"
882,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or tortoise; and, that the sun was slipped clean"
883,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Back west to east, at night by us unseen,"
884,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the chariot of the Sun-god with his team
885,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of steeds as swift as if they were run by steam.
886,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,These views by them held sacred were impressed
887,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On others who even speculatively guessed,"
888,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That there might be error in the sacred book,"
889,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or else those who read failed to look
890,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Deep enough into lines between lines,"
891,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where sometimes most information one finds.
892,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Shaking off their fear, daring men began to peer,"
893,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Into the upper air with telescopes, far and near;"
894,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Until upon them dawned beyond escape,"
895,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By the picture on the moon and its shape,"
896,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That, book or no book, the world was a globe."
897,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, to fully prove it, they toiled and strove,"
898,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Till Columbus the Great, did daringly navigate"
899,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Far enough to see it and stop the debate.
900,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That one hazardous stroke by this brave man
901,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Struck the shackles from science and began
902,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A new era, in which truth conquers belief,"
903,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And consecrated error dies to our relief.
904,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The door now being thrown open wide, men pried,"
905,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And delved into nature with rapid stride.
906,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By the light of astronomy as their guide,"
907,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It was discovered that those specks that shine
908,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,High up in the heavens at the night time
909,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are suns and worlds that in their orbits move
910,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Around greater centers in distance so high
911,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As not to be seen as when through glass we spy.
912,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That all those moving worlds by one supreme law
913,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of gravitation yield their obedience in awe.
914,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To the bottom of the sea men dived to find
915,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The wrecks of ages there accumulated by time,"
916,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As old ocean waves roll over them its slime.
917,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Into the strata of the rocks marking each age
918,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As time passed written on them page by page,"
919,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The history of the earth before the historic age;
920,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Men have dug up fossils for scholar and sage.
921,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With silken thread, they drew lightning from the sky,"
922,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And harnessed it up our trade and commerce to ply.
923,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By microscope and tools chemists use,"
924,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The varied elements have been made to fuse
925,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Into numerous new substances by man used
926,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the varied arts to which existence imparts
927,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The glories of the times from which we start.
928,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The doctor, with his scalpel and his knife,"
929,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Discovers new means for preserving human life.
930,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The inventor with his machines, human labor to supply,"
931,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To the plowman who plods on his weary way;
932,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To the weaver who with his hands from day to day,"
933,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,His cloth he did weave in the old-fashioned way.
934,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The builder with his bricks of sand and clay
935,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Once made with mud securely encased in hay
936,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"His stone, plaster, lumber, hardware and nails,"
937,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All made by machinery which little labor entails.
938,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The merchant with his cargo laden in a ship,"
939,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Propelled by steam as over the deep they slip.
940,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The baker with his ovens and pans,"
941,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Bakes and makes his bread without hands.
942,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All these with telegraph and telephones supplied,"
943,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Carrying messages as over wires they slide,"
944,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With lightning speed, bringing to each his need,"
945,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Shortening time and obliterating space,"
946,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As each against the other runs his race,"
947,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For gains in the occupations they chase.
948,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The grave lawyer sitting wise at his desk,"
949,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Dictating to stenographers things he may suggest,"
950,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"About cases in court or making a report,"
951,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of some opinion great in matters of weight
952,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About all the business to which they relate
953,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the matters and things of those who wait
954,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their troubles to tell and business to state.

956,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With throttle and valve, and whistle peal"
957,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Rolling over the land, propelled by steam,"
958,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Crossing mountain, valley and stream,"
959,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On tracks, rails and bridges of steel."
960,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The flying machine shot up in mid air
961,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sailing over continents in feats they dare,"
962,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Rivaling the plumed eagle in his flight,"
963,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or those swift birds that pass in a night,"
964,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From out their abodes beyond human sight.
965,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The magic needle that points to the pole,"
966,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Guiding navigation on oceans untold;
967,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And those brave adventurers seeking the pole,"
968,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Where the earth on its axis turns,"
969,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To find that for which their ambition burns:
970,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Losing their crew in the cold, wintry snow,"
971,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Too weak from hunger, them to follow."
972,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And onward, how far can the genius of man go?"
973,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With Edison, the wizard, putting on a show"
974,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of actors, scenes and stage, singing as they go,"
975,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Talking and walking, dancing and playing airs"
976,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,On every instrument that man’s skill prepares
977,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All through a little machine, run by a wheel;"
978,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And electric apparatus he did conceal,"
979,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From watching eyes his invention might steal.
980,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, there’s Marconi, flashing across land and sea"
981,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"His messages of glad tidings without wires on tree,"
982,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or pole, and nothing to guide his machine,"
983,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So far as any one has yet seen.
984,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If such men had appeared in the olden day,"
985,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Before Columbus had marked out the way,"
986,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They surely would have burned at the stake,"
987,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For witchcraft and all for conscience’ sake.
988,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Yet with the strides men have made,"
989,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With sickle, sword, guns, knife and spade,"
990,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With piston, valve, gears, driver and wheel,"
991,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Driven by light, electricity, steam and heated steel,"
992,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their thought flying upon the world to reveal
993,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The acts and doings of nature and of man,"
994,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From ocean to ocean all over the broad land
995,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And even over the wide extended seas we expand,"
996,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With telegraphic cables from land to land,"
997,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Bringing all the forces of nature at our command.
998,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With it all, we have made a very little head"
999,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Ourselves to control, by designing leaders led."
1000,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Those simple rules, by which nature acts,"
1001,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Might be applied to government its burden to relax,"
1002,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And take from the shoulders of labor the fearful tax,"

1046,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Deeds of a certain kind are called crimes;
1047,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For the perpetration of which in historic times,"
1048,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Men have sought to punish their course to stay,"
1049,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Every one who does them in some kind of way.
1050,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By the power of the state men may collate,"
1051,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All kinds of acts which by law they state
1052,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To be offenses for one them to perpetrate.
1053,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"These acts in themselves, may be for our good"
1054,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When understood, yet by the statute they would"
1055,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Be crimes just the same, whether bad or good."
1056,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The original idea of punishment probably grew out
1057,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of our natural impulse just to take a bout
1058,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With any fellow who ever did us any dirt
1059,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To see if him we could not also hurt
1060,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A little more, or just as much as to us he did;"
1061,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Pull his tooth for our tooth, and his eye with the lid,"
1062,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For our eye he did black simply to pay him back.
1063,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In a later day to give reasons for our laws
1064,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Which by the wise were sought, we had to pause,"
1065,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So then we simply said, punish to stop crime."
1066,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now suppose that I could show that in no time,"
1067,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Did punishment ever even our crimes diminish,"
1068,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Much less did it ever bring them to a finish.
1069,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your eyes will open wide when I say to you;
1070,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The stopping of crimes punishment will never do.
1071,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Men will more chances take, your neck to break,"
1072,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Your goods to steal, and your girls to snake"
1073,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Off and defile, even if you are wide awake"
1074,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Against the whole complicated machinery of the law,"
1075,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Than they would by getting immediately into your claw;
1076,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When with weapons good, you certainly would"
1077,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Make all respect your rights as you them understood.
1078,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The plan indicated above could not all at once
1079,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Be put into practice, for you’d be a dunce"
1080,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To turn loose so many who had never had any
1081,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Training in the matter we set up as a crime.
1082,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The way for you to do is to drop one at a time
1083,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of your statutory crimes punishable by fine,"
1084,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Mostly passed to give jobs to a certain class
1085,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of human vegetables who stalk about in brass.
1086,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That you may cautiously follow up the scale
1087,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In all its detail, and you’ll never fail"
1088,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To accomplish good in giving people their rights
1089,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And in keeping them quiet and free from fights.
1090,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By the penitentiaries you keep and your jails
1091,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where people sleep with vermin on rails;
1092,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Waiting for trial before jury and judge.
1093,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Weeks before they are allowed to budge,"
1094,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Makes them have against you such a grudge;
1095,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That when they get loose, as they frequently do"
1096,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They go at their old tricks with energy anew
1097,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To see how dastardly they can act in the crimes they do.
1098,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In your hatcheries of crime, the bunch you have to feed"
1099,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Seems to be increasing with a gradual, steady speed."
1100,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The time may come when the gang in the walls,"
1101,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"May outnumber us when at their leader’s calls,"
1102,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They might break out with a united band,"
1103,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Overpower us, and devastate the land."
1104,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So that whatever you do, make your crimes few;"
1105,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And those you do define, stand firmly to."
1106,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The more laws you have the more it’ll take
1107,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To handle all those who their behests break.
1108,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“Laws are a necessary evil” was truly said
1109,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By a great hero, now sleeping among the dead."
1110,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So the less of this evil upon ourselves we fix
1111,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The more good we can with our liberty mix.
1112,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Those progressives of you who make such ado
1113,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"About our laws, and the courts in which you sue,"
1114,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Want to fill our statutes all the way through
1115,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With every law and sumptuary regulation,"
1116,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On every subject in the whole creation,"
1117,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That, in their wrought up imagination,"
1118,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They can conceive of to make litigation;
1119,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,(Telling us that they comprehend the situation)
1120,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They’d put on the books without investigation.
1121,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You’d like to snake all this through,"
1122,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Thinking that nobody is watching you;
1123,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But you had better try and hold yourself back;
1124,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We are watching you, and I am now on your track."
1125,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Now the courts are made the laws to enforce;
1126,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It is their job, and you and I of course,"
1127,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Cannot dictate to them what laws to enforce.
1128,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To criticise the courts as the newspapers do
1129,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Might put us in contempt, the same as you"
1130,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In some cases where you had to keep out of view;
1131,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or run a lively race to keep yourself out of jail
1132,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By hanging on to some big lawyer’s coat-tail.
1133,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About your courts I will simply suggest
1134,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That whatever might be done I deem it best
1135,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of the things we might do, get judges true,"
1136,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Learned and wise, and who do not know you"
1137,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nor me, nor any of the folks that sue"
1138,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their cases in court before them;
1139,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The opinions they write with type or pen
1140,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Will be free from the bias of men then.
1141,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They will consider the laws, sort out the flaws"
1142,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In each case, and every litigated cause;"
1143,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So that the judgment they shall render
1144,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Making you your supposed rights surrender
1145,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Will be honest, no matter what we tender;"
1146,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Although you practically sink by their blunder
1147,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Until in amazement you begin to wonder
1148,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Whether your lawyer really did plunder
1149,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Through all the books to get you from under
1150,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The load that is imposed when your case is closed
1151,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the court of the judge you supposed
1152,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Had sense enough not to be bulldozed.

1158,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1159,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1160,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Two little frogs their legs began to turn,"
1161,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Haply leaped and jumped into a churn.
1162,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The churn was filled about half full
1163,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of milk from which we our butter pull.
1164,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,One frog to his mate did say:--
1165,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“We’re here to stay and can’t get away.
1166,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now you may paddle and your head addle,"
1167,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But I’ll bebobdaddle if I’ll saddle
1168,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On myself the task to get out of the flask,"
1169,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I’m going to die, and no use to cry,"
1170,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So good-bye,” and down he went dead."
1171,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The other made no reply, but paddled ahead"
1172,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And paid no heed to what the first had said.
1173,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By and by a big chunk of butter came
1174,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, upon the same froggie rode"
1175,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Feeling the load off his mind throw’d.
1176,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In a short time there came a grunting swine
1177,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Walking slowly up out of his grime,"
1178,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And shaking off his slime, rooted the churn over,"
1179,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Letting little froggie jump in clover.

1187,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nearly all of the animals go in herds,"
1188,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Fishes, mammals, bees, ants, and even birds."
1189,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The snakes are not so socially inclined;
1190,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They had rather with none combined,"
1191,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Slip cautiously alone and snap from behind.
1192,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Man has always a social animal been,"
1193,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To get his food and commit his sin.
1194,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He has always stood for organizations,"
1195,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Municipalities, states and corporations,"
1196,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Made to protect him against depredations.
1197,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whenever new thoughts take form in his head,"
1198,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He is sure to try to have others into them led,"
1199,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By his talks and whatever by him is said.
1200,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Man has made laws and written them down,"
1201,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Telling the good people all not frown;
1202,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That by their consent these laws are made:
1203,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“The consent of the governed,”"
1204,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is exactly what they said.
1205,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That is true as the law-makers by your vote,"
1206,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are elected your welfare to promote.
1207,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Laws are rules laid down for our control,"
1208,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Pointing out paths where we may not stroll,"
1209,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Marking the lines in which our rights are defined,"
1210,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Commanding and forbidding the multifarious kind
1211,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of the things we must do or leave behind.
1212,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some laws are on natural justice based;
1213,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That might be speculatively traced
1214,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To the dealings of man in his beginning;
1215,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Starting out in the races he was winning
1216,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Over his ancestors, those animals called “low,”"
1217,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He might have come upon one not so slow;
1218,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who singly could not be brought down with a blow;
1219,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So with his likes he combined the swift one to get
1220,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For their food, and their appetites to whet."
1221,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now when this animal combined they took,"
1222,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The question was up, and not a law book,"
1223,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By which to decide who should take the hide;
1224,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And into what and how many parts the rest to divide:
1225,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So they naturally counted the number of their gang,"
1226,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While this juicy meat did before them hang;
1227,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And number parts equal to the number of them
1228,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Was equally cut off the beast from stern to stem:
1229,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The meat thus divided the hide could not
1230,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Be usefully carved up, so they gambled for it by lot:"
1231,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In the hand of each a pebble to throw at a spot,"
1232,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They took to try who closest to the mark got;
1233,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the one it who did the nearest hit,"
1234,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Took away the hide for his skill and grit.
1235,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The idea of justice thus received
1236,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is about as good as has ever been achieved,"
1237,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By reading all the books in every case
1238,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where the law is defined for the human race.
1239,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Life might be likened to a game of chance
1240,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the laws, the rules by which we advance"
1241,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Our men upon the board or throw the lance:
1242,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When people together their business transact,"
1243,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Follow the rules, and courts will solve the contract."
1244,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When our forefathers made this Republic of ours,"
1245,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They established a constitution limiting the powers,"
1246,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That the government itself could exercise
1247,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The best to preserve our liberty they could devise.
1248,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Even before this fundamental law they did make,"
1249,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Which of necessity did part of our liberty take,"
1250,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They prefaced all our laws for me and you
1251,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With certain inalienable rights kept in view:
1252,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“That all men were created equal,” they knew;"
1253,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“That life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,”"
1254,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Were set out in plain view, our land to bless."
1255,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now every law since that date passed by the state,"
1256,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To that extent our liberties infringe, even though we scringe;"
1257,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And feel the distress, without redress,"
1258,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of many iniquitous acts, even by Congress."
1259,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If men were actually well-behaved,"
1260,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Much useless trouble and expense could be saved:
1261,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Laws being hobbies our liberties to restrain;
1262,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some barely holding us, even with tight rein."
1263,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The socialist man, if I do not mistake,"
1264,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Would all restraint from our law makers take,"
1265,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So that the state might feed and regulate
1266,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All the peoples who come within its gate,"
1267,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And all others’ properties appropriate,"
1268,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To the general good as by them understood.
1269,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The titles to your lands and everything good
1270,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That on them stands, they would concentrate"
1271,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Into public hands whom they would nominate.
1272,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The labor and the work, the leaders would shirk,"
1273,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Would be done by some one or his clerk.
1274,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So that we all would have a good time,"
1275,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In our day, should we adopt their line."
1276,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“Every man has a right to work and eat”;
1277,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And such clap trap of verbiage we meet,"
1278,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,On every hand as we go over our land.
1279,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They jabber, but their sense I can’t see."
1280,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,How can this come in the land of the free?
1281,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They produce arguments hoary with age,"
1282,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Used by many a high-class sage,"
1283,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That the ownership of property--especially land,"
1284,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Never had a foundation on which it could stand.
1285,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That the whole idea was a fiction once,"
1286,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And not to see it now one is a dunce.
1287,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That all your vested rights on paper,"
1288,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Are unsound, no matter what caper"
1289,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Folks may cut their supposed rights to hold,"
1290,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With all their power and hoarded gold.
1291,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If they can unite the working man on their side,"
1292,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They hope into power to gloriously slide.
1293,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The men who labor with their hands have all
1294,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,United into bands.
1295,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Feeling that the little work there is to do
1296,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Must pay the most to the ones who pursue
1297,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Trades of all kinds and of every hue.
1298,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That the work for men to do with hands
1299,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is constant, regardless of supply and demands;"
1300,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Never once observing that the cost
1301,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of production many jobs them have lost.
1302,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So even if they do get more out of that they do;
1303,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The valuable time lost in the trades they pursue,"
1304,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Will more than compensate for th’ advanced rate
1305,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They obtain from the fewer jobs that remain.
1306,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Why it does not occur to them while they dream
1307,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"What a big world this is with all its demesne,"
1308,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is a matter beyond explanation by what I ween.
1309,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That work is not confined on this big earth,"
1310,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But spreads out to give us all a wide berth.
1311,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Against trusts and monied corporations,"
1312,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Men in their stations might form associations
1313,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Their rights to demand and their wrongs to reduce,"
1314,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But against th’ individual there is no excuse,"
1315,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Why unions upon him should heap their abuse.
1316,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If one build a house to cover up his head,"
1317,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Why should union labor try to kill him dead,"
1318,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By making the cost so high that none can buy,"
1319,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Houses building now far and nigh.
1320,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But all these perplexing questions are upon us;
1321,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the merits and demerits we must discuss,"
1322,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If practical socialism must come,"
1323,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We must face it, each and every one."
1324,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By the brotherhood of man, maybe we can"
1325,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Find a way to harmonize every tribe and clan
1326,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And save this civilization for the good of man.

1332,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1333,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1334,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,My subject here is simply a term to express
1335,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“A somewhat,” the nature of which is a guess."
1336,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of the substance contained in the above term,"
1337,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It seems almost impossible for one to learn,"
1338,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"No image of it in his mind can he conceive,"
1339,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Reflects the intelligence he’d wish to receive.
1340,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"What the public looks like or is,"
1341,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is more than you can tell or wis.
1342,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,According to some it’s “ideas in th’ abstract.”
1343,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So let us take that for the real fact.
1344,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The public does not seem to be you or I
1345,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or anybody else--I’ll tell you why;
1346,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whoever or whatever the thing may be,"
1347,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He, she, or it shoulders blame for you and me,"
1348,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For wickedness done in his dear name,"
1349,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And credit for intended good, the same,"
1350,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In very many cases that men declaim.
1351,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If a bunch of grafters wish to float a deal,"
1352,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Say in baking powder, wheat, or oat meal;"
1353,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"First the public pulse they scientifically feel,"
1354,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To discover signs of fever germs in foods,"
1355,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We’ve been eating, and such other goods"
1356,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of the same kinds we’ve bought all our lives,"
1357,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And from which others are supporting wives,"
1358,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And children as they’ve done all their lives.
1359,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of course their doctor this pulse carefully felt,"
1360,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And discovered that germ tracks were smelt
1361,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In most of the stuff we put in our pelt.
1362,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He discovered too that alum would
1363,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Dry up the diaphragm if used in food.
1364,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Also that certain foods contained sand,"
1365,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That might get into the public craw, and"
1366,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Brace them up too much to patriotically vote
1367,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For such a pure food law as they’d like to float.
1368,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So after their analysis was properly wrote,"
1369,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They get their pure food law nicely framed up
1370,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To suit their scheme and for the people to gulp.
1371,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then their bugle horns they did blare,"
1372,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And it carried before we were aware.
1373,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1374,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1375,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1376,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1377,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Physicians
1378,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1379,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1380,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In olden times, doctors and barbers were the same,"
1381,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As we find in books from which we always gain
1382,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Information on all such historic matter.
1383,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As bleeding was the thing then to batter
1384,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Out diseases the striped pole must be
1385,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,An emblematic relic of the blood running free
1386,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Down and around our hip, thigh and knee."
1387,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But the two trades have been now long separated;
1388,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And while neither should be underestimated
1389,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And both receive their due from me and you,"
1390,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The barbers’ trade is not really and truly due
1391,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As much criticism as is the medicine crew.
1392,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"There are plenty of fine physicians and surgeons,"
1393,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who receive their praise from us in legions;
1394,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But the “money-rosis” has struck the doctors
1395,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As other trades, including divorce proctors."
1396,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I well remember in the days long past,"
1397,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Pulse felt, and a look at the color the tongue cast,"
1398,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When the doctor was done, and no more was asked."
1399,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He said it was simply chills and fever he did believe,"
1400,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Which a good dose of calomel or blue mass would relieve,"
1401,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All of which the patient did then and there receive.
1402,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You might have had a slight pain in your head,"
1403,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And you were advised to lie still in bed.
1404,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now call a doctor your wife to see,"
1405,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And while you sent for only one to fee,"
1406,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Two or three more and sometimes a score,"
1407,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To handle the different parts of the sore,"
1408,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Come in and watch around your door;
1409,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Especially if you’ve got money, and get more."
1410,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If you fall and bruise your knee or elbow
1411,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A specialist must come to whom they show
1412,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some of the dirt from the place around,"
1413,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To ascertain if any microbes are found.
1414,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If a cough or cold comes in your head,"
1415,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A sample or two of the sputum that you shed,"
1416,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is sealed up and sent away to be analyzed.
1417,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They always find ’em, so don’t be surprised."
1418,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And if plenty of money you can get
1419,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To pay all this cost and never sweat,"
1420,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When your bills at home are all paid,"
1421,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You’ll be then sent off on dress parade.
1422,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Doctors never come now and find you well;
1423,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Your ailments have names you cannot spell.
1424,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And when you ask what you’re about to take
1425,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The awful malady you have to try to shake
1426,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To pronounce its name your jawbone’ll break.
1427,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As simple a dose as soda and rain water
1428,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,At the drug store will cost you a quarter.
1429,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All diseases now come straight from bacilli
1430,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Seen through those microscopes they buy.
1431,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let these germs once your systems fill
1432,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You just as well not make your will,"
1433,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It’ll take the farm to pay your doctor bill,"
1434,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All diseases have now become contagious.
1435,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And their catching qualities outrageous.
1436,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you walk do not spit on the street,"
1437,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Lest your saliva infect those you meet.
1438,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,No trains are allowed to have a drinking cup
1439,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In which others drink, lest you swallow up"
1440,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The other fellow’s germs sticking to the glass
1441,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of the family of microbes in the tubercular class.
1442,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"No comb or brush is found to smooth your hair,"
1443,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They’re prohibited and blacklisted everywhere.
1444,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All your water must be thoroughly boiled
1445,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And its palatable flavor entirely spoiled,"
1446,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To slay the ferocious germs in it coiled.
1447,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And even the milk from your fat Jersey cow
1448,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Should be pasteurized as never before till now.
1449,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We might run down the whole category
1450,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Till you were tired, and I get hoary,"
1451,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But these very things are the doctor’s glory.
1452,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of course they are trying to lengthen life’s span,"
1453,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And I’m not going to censure them if I can,"
1454,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Only caution them to be easy as they can.
1455,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They don’t catch me often, my father was a physician,"
1456,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And before he died, he made it his mission"
1457,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To post me and make me wise on this score.
1458,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I have sometimes felt peevish and sore
1459,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because father was too honest to lay up a store
1460,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For me to spend when I life began;
1461,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,My father was above all an honest man.
1462,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Once my wife took pneumonic cough
1463,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And we for a doctor sent right off.
1464,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He came and found genuine bacilli.
1465,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Scared me, and made the wife almost cry."
1466,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They analyzed, criticised and diagnosed"
1467,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And sent her away, with my house closed;"
1468,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And for nights I scarcely dozed.
1469,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They gave her just six months of life
1470,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Before consumption would part me and my wife.
1471,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"My plucky woman partly believed what they said,"
1472,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And moped around a while and stayed in bed.
1473,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I had some doubts about what the specialists said,"
1474,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And relied a little on what an old friend read,"
1475,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who had much practical experience, she said."
1476,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of course my doubts about science I hate to tell,"
1477,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But in a few weeks the wife was entirely well.
1478,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If the doctor wants to, let him tell"
1479,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Why into the aforesaid mistake he fell.
1480,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now you had all better beware and treat us fair,"
1481,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If you have doubts about what our troubles are
1482,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Just do your best, and let nature do the rest."
1483,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1484,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1485,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1486,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1487,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Theologians
1488,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1489,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1490,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For the preacher’s trade one should have a call,"
1491,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As has been said concerning the apostle Paul;
1492,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who with power armed with writs to haul
1493,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Before magistrates Christians one and all,"
1494,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And lodge them in jails subject to call
1495,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To be prosecuted in the name of the state
1496,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For sayings of Christ they did relate.
1497,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“Why persecutest thou me?” the Master said;
1498,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then Saul, afterwards Paul, fell as one dead."
1499,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When he came to be had a call to preach,"
1500,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So he went forth all nations to teach.
1501,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Not many of you preachers ever had a call,"
1502,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Nor down as dead did any of you ever fall.
1503,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Most of you took to preaching to have something to do,"
1504,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Although the picking is getting short for some of you,"
1505,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If the newspaper accounts I’m reading be true.
1506,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When the lawyer’s job in the country gets short,"
1507,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He adds insurance, abstracts, and things of that sort;"
1508,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But when the preacher’s picking isn’t very good
1509,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,He’d have ice-cream suppers whenever he could;
1510,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or even quiltings and sewing society aid,"
1511,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Eked out with dinners and sale of lemonade.
1512,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I notice now you’re going to take course
1513,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In farming to teach the brethren of the rural force;
1514,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But I’m afraid that if you begin shoot’n off your head
1515,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To some of those old rustics to help earn your bread,"
1516,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You might get a set’n back worse than Old Ned,"
1517,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or even than Saul got when he fell as dead.
1518,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Farmers have ideas of their own they’ve tried;
1519,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And wouldn’t listen to the pastor or turn aside,"
1520,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For his book learning he had himself supplied
1521,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While off at college that had never been tried.
1522,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You might do better holding to the plow,"
1523,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"While your brother farmer was milking his cow,"
1524,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Feeding his stock and chopping his wood,"
1525,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And in that way would do him more good.
1526,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But the best way for all is to wait for this call.
1527,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And don’t be in a hurry to be preachers at all.
1528,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If you wait a real call to actually hear,"
1529,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You’ll be working soon and will not have to fear,"
1530,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Without any other call than nature gives
1531,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To every animal that on earth now lives;
1532,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To be up and doing his fellow man to bless,"
1533,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which while doing you’ll keep from distress.
1534,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1535,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1536,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1537,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1538,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Lawyers
1539,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1540,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1541,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To attorneys, advocates, and counsellors all,"
1542,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I’m not afraid to speak to you about your call;
1543,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Not afraid to give advice, I’m one of you,"
1544,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You may heed, or I don’t care what you do."
1545,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You give advice and charge for the same;
1546,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Mine I freely give, and you get the gain."
1547,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you get free what to others you sell,"
1548,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You’ve something to brag about and tell.
1549,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I like you, you bunch of jolly good fellows,"
1550,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Though you sometimes lunch like Col. Sellers.
1551,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And your Sunday suit gets so slick,"
1552,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That a fly cannot walk on it and stick.
1553,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You too are letting people into your trade.
1554,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Deeds and legal papers are so easily made,"
1555,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By real estate agents filling out blanks
1556,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Those you write are paid for in thanks.
1557,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You sit in your office with high-propped feet,"
1558,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Longing for a friend to invite you out to eat,"
1559,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or waiting for a client to bring around a fee.
1560,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sometimes you read or skip around in glee,"
1561,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To make the impression that your mind is free;
1562,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And that you have plenty of work to do;
1563,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And never for a moment take a solemn view
1564,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of how fast business is flying away from you.
1565,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some of you are learning on a motor cycle to ride,"
1566,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So when an accident occurs you are by the side
1567,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of the injured one to get a damage suit
1568,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Against the company whose coffers you’d loot.
1569,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some of you join the gang and get in politics,"
1570,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To get some legal job they may help you fix.
1571,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"One of you stirs up strife against divorce,"
1572,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And gets to be proctor on the welfare force,"
1573,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And gets a small salary as a matter of course.
1574,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some get to be orators public affairs to discuss.
1575,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And get the press over you to make a fuss;
1576,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In that way you advertise your brains good
1577,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To swing a big case and get a livelihood.
1578,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some join with unions to fight against the trusts,"
1579,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Others against the unions sling their deadly thrusts.
1580,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Thus in battle array, some right and some wrong,"
1581,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We manage in some way to push ourselves along.
1582,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The race of the old-time lawyers is nearly extinct
1583,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To whose memory my fond thoughts are linked.
1584,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I know a few whose names I’ll not give to you
1585,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Owing to my plan I intend to follow through,"
1586,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Not to give names unless to represent a crew.
1587,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You know some yourself not in the law for pelf;
1588,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I’m one myself if into my record you care to look,"
1589,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If I hadn’t been I need not have written a book
1590,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To make a little stake to put away for a rainy day.
1591,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Lawyers are not dishonest, no matter what you say,"
1592,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Except when they serve you to get their pay.
1593,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They have to be deceiving to keep up with you:
1594,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You will not take your case you wish to sue
1595,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To some attorney who could not stand for you.
1596,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You know the attorney stands in your place,"
1597,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And to an honest one you dare not show your face.
1598,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I’ve known lawyers who courted the name of crook,"
1599,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Merely to catch grafters on their own hook.
1600,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You know well when you are sued that you choose
1601,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"An attorney who will by any ruse, you excuse"
1602,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To the jury who tried your case for the deeds,"
1603,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You did, and you know you did not get your meeds."
1604,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So shut up your mouth and hie yourself home;
1605,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The subject of judges and lawyers leave alone.
1606,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Lawyers have always been pillars of the state
1607,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To uphold our institutions you’d annihilate.
1608,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their trade is not alone on paper made;
1609,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It comes from growth by development’s aid.
1610,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It’s the garnered experience of all the ages,"
1611,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Written in books upon numberless pages.
1612,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It has stood when empires fell,"
1613,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When to the despots they did loudly tell
1614,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of justice upon him the law’d compel;
1615,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It has stood against strife, slaughter and blood,"
1616,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When other trades and institutions never could;
1617,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It rises in the right, iniquity to fight,"
1618,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To protect the weak against men of might,"
1619,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Over widows and orphans its protecting arm
1620,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is extended to save the mortgaged farm;
1621,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It shields the criminal against the crazy mob
1622,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Giving him a trial of which they’d him rob.
1623,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For peace and order and justice in the land
1624,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let us ever as true lawyers stand.
1625,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1626,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1627,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1628,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1629,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Names
1630,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1631,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1632,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By the use of names we designate
1633,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some particular thing, person or state."
1634,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The naming of animals in the first place,"
1635,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Was put upon Adam as father of the race.
1636,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This job imposed upon him no great task,"
1637,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Because no one’s permission he had to ask,"
1638,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whether the name suited mule or cow,"
1639,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or the name horse he might to kid allow.
1640,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Now the names of animals who came
1641,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Before him in a long-extended train,"
1642,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They had to take those which for them he did book
1643,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because they did not have a list over which to look.
1644,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All proper names men can find,"
1645,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Have been so often used by men of their kind,"
1646,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That when a child is about to be born,"
1647,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Into the world, the name it shall adorn"
1648,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Has to be taken from the long list
1649,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of those gone before, or who still persist."
1650,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Although we have quite a long catalogue,"
1651,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We still have to search and our memory jog
1652,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To ascertain the character of the ones
1653,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who bore the name about to be given to our sons;
1654,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because any name may have been soiled
1655,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By its owner around whom might be coiled
1656,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The evidence of some offense the name to suffuse
1657,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Before the time we it did choose.
1658,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The likes and dislikes for names we take,"
1659,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Come mostly from the character of the namesake.
1660,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A lot of names might be brought to view:
1661,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Like Jennie, Sallie, Mollie, Kate and Sue;"
1662,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or Perkins, Phelps, Pickering, and Penn,"
1663,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And a whole book full of names for women and men.
1664,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The others need not here be enrolled,"
1665,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In this little volume, or by me polled."
1666,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The things that did once make names great
1667,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Generally were acts done for the state,"
1668,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Mostly in war, e. g., Alexander the Great,"
1669,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or Caesar, or even Napoleon the Sedate."
1670,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Sometimes names receive much eclat
1671,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"At home, as well as near and far,"
1672,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Like Washington, or our Jefferson,"
1673,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And also Cleveland and Lincoln,"
1674,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By statesmanship with head and brain
1675,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For the public good when peace did reign.
1676,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"There used to be a time, now almost past,"
1677,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When patriotism was then in full blast,"
1678,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That men would sometimes almost actually do things
1679,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With no other pay than the consolation it brings,"
1680,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Simply to be esteemed just, good and true,"
1681,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With no other motive than to bless me and you.
1682,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But now of late men look upon the state
1683,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Simply as a fat goose for them down,"
1684,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As o’er them her wings may spread around,"
1685,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To hover and her blessings bring down.
1686,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The offices men fill to uphold the law,"
1687,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or collect our revenues to fat their maw
1688,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Are held mostly by ones we did not choose,"
1689,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who with politicians by some sharp ruse
1690,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Got nominated and elected against our views;
1691,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And when elected frame up bills
1692,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For legislation that their own pocket fills,"

1694,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That fall upon the public that foots the bills.
1695,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,New bureaus are made about everything
1696,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To which a gang of leaches can cling;
1697,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With their matrons, clerks and superintendents,"
1698,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All hangers-on and their bunch of dependents,"
1699,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Disgracing all over our broad land,"
1700,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On every hand, the very name of man:"
1701,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I fear that our present civilization cannot stand,"
1702,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To live down the iniquity by them thus began.
1703,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The euphonious name of Guggenheimer,"
1704,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sipniski, Schradski, or even Joe Reimer,"
1705,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now is fine if their amounts in bank,"
1706,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Stood their drafts and never shrank
1707,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Below the balance they had on hand
1708,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With the banks throughout the land.
1709,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A good name is appraised above riches,"
1710,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But to keep that good to which one hitches,"
1711,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When anyone can claim any name he likes
1712,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And ruin it forever, when off he hikes"
1713,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To Canada or Old Mexico to get away
1714,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From the crimes he did in his day;
1715,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Making the name disgraceful he wears,"
1716,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And none of the same name spares
1717,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"From sharing the shame brought on the name,"
1718,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To us, innocent and free from blame,"
1719,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Except for the acts he did against our name.
1720,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Ambition leads us to attempt undying fame,"
1721,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That after we are dead and in our grave
1722,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Our name shall live that we did engrave
1723,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Among the world’s heroes on every page
1724,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of history that dies not with old age.
1725,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But everything to make us famous or great
1726,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Has been by someone, somewhere in every state"
1727,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of civilization accomplished and achieved,"
1728,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So no chance is left for us, though grieved."
1729,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So let us not try to make our names great;
1730,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But instead, unite to rescue our own state,"
1731,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From the clutches of the vultures at its heart;
1732,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And if we succeed at that, when we depart,"
1733,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Those left behind will bear us in mind,"
1734,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And write our names in the highest place they find.
1735,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1736,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1737,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1738,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1739,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Universal Peace
1740,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1741,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1742,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In all the past the records are full of war;
1743,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Men had one desire to be in a continual jar;
1744,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or else the peaceful victories they did win
1745,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Were not such as they wrote therein.
1746,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Each nation, tribe, and men of ancient race"
1747,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For each other had nothing but hatred and menace.
1748,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Upon the boundaries and rights of each,"
1749,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The other did recklessly go to reach,"
1750,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With rapine and murder in their hearts,"
1751,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To snatch from each other all such parts
1752,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of their lands, and their goods to confiscate,"
1753,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As could be done by the hordes they did aggregate.
1754,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Their warriors and men to subjugate,"
1755,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their women and fair maids to subject
1756,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To brutality, and any other object"
1757,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As they chose upon them to impose.
1758,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,There were only two kinds in those times
1759,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of peoples on earth, those in their own confines,"
1760,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And barbarians who dwelt anywhere else,"
1761,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Regardless of who they were, Goths, Huns or Celts."
1762,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"No tie of sympathy was known or recognized,"
1763,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Between those different tribes;
1764,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Each for the other was lawful prize.
1765,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Robbery, theft, and murder were terms,"
1766,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Applied to deeds committed at home;
1767,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"These same acts out where they did roam,"
1768,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Were designated bravery and prowess,"
1769,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When upon barbarians they did egress,"
1770,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With battle-axe, darts, helmet and shield,"
1771,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Bent on the slaughter of their fellow man;
1772,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For conquest and glory, they led the van;"
1773,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Over mountains filled with perpetual snow,"
1774,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Into heated valleys where the sun did glow;
1775,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They fought for pride, religion and show;"
1776,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As upon crowned heads they wore
1777,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Laurels of victory for blood and gore.
1778,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But now has dawned a better day;
1779,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From ocean to ocean where men survey
1780,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their lands and the boundaries fix
1781,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where rights of each the line restricts;
1782,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And treaties with one nation is made
1783,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With others to settle their commerce and trade.
1784,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They bring across oceans in merchant marine,"
1785,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Luxuries of life now by us all seen,"
1786,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Grown and shipped from the uttermost lands,"
1787,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Divided from us by seas, deserts and sands."
1788,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Those natural laws we are learning to use,"
1789,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Based upon justice according to the views
1790,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of publicists and statesmen applied
1791,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To nations dealing with nations the world wide.
1792,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Now the crude implements of death once used
1793,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By ancients, are thrown aside and refused."
1794,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In place of triremes propelled by oars,"
1795,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Steel-clad battleships ride by scores,"
1796,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Manned with guns throwing missiles miles;
1797,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Around our coasts and adjacent isles;
1798,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Our barricades and our battlements,"
1799,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Our field glasses and our armaments;
1800,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Our powder in guns and in mines,"
1801,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With deadly explosives of all kinds,"
1802,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Making killing a thing of skill
1803,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Upon the thousands our inventions kill,"
1804,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All are bringing war to a standstill.
1805,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,No longer do we hand to hand in war engage;
1806,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Foes rushing foes with eyes in a rage;
1807,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Instead, the scientific gunner his aim to gauge,"
1808,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Miles away, his gun adjusting to suit,"
1809,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Deals death to thousands, wherever he may shoot;"
1810,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With no malice in his heart, by electric touch,"
1811,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some mine is exploded, killing and destroying as much"
1812,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In a single blow, as was done in a day the old way;"
1813,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And in all the soldiers are out of the fray.
1814,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Why should we slaughter and fellow men slay,"
1815,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In this unimpassioned, calculating, scientific way?"
1816,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If such things, done by the whole nation,"
1817,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Were done by one, it’d be murder in our estimation."
1818,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Inventions and knowledge lead towards peace;
1819,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And the frequency of war decrease;
1820,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The more we know of our fellowman.
1821,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The less we like to cut off his span.
1822,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So let the dove of peace hover over the globe,"
1823,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And in humanity’s cause we ourselves enrobe;
1824,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Till from war and all its sickening pall,"
1825,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We advance, and universal peace install;"
1826,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And we may, unless we get up a protocol,"
1827,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Over which we may fight to see who is right,"
1828,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the interpretation thereof withal.

1835,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1836,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,About the subject of music what can I say?
1837,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That mystical combination we sing and play?
1838,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The origin of which none seem to know;
1839,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For as far back into the past as we can go,"
1840,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"From the time that Circe and her maids,"
1841,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In their lonely isle of forests and glades,"
1842,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Their magic spells, in song, upon the sailor wrought,"
1843,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With all his crew, to their abode they brought,"
1844,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To change them to swine from the forms of men;
1845,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Until wise Ulysses, by some godlike ken,"
1846,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Undid the deed done his men confined in a pen;
1847,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or when Orpheus with his lyre in his hand,"
1848,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Held his sway through th’ enchanted land.
1849,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So ’twould be a waste of valuable time,"
1850,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The history and origin of music to put into rhyme.
1851,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It seems that it has long over us held sway;
1852,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Back from the long ago to the present day.
1853,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But in all times before this day of ours,"
1854,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When men have harnessed th’ unseen powers:
1855,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It did take the skill of finger tips
1856,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or the trill of throat and puckered lips,"
1857,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To wake from vibrations thereby made,"
1858,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The thrilling chant and sweet serenade.
1859,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But now with pricking pins of steel,"
1860,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Those same vibrations come from turn of wheel,"
1861,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When in dents lightly made on a disc,"
1862,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which around and around we playfully whisk;
1863,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The pin points strike in and then out,"
1864,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As the thing is whirled about;
1865,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, by magnifying the scratching it makes"
1866,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The picture of the whole sound action it takes;
1867,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And reproduces the vibrations on our ear,"
1868,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of an opera or any piece we wish to hear.
1869,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By the numerous machines by inventors made,"
1870,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The sweet music once by human skill played,"
1871,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Has passed into commerce of daily trade.
1872,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For a few dollars one can buy,"
1873,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A music maker if he will but try.
1874,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Although the music thus made is not the real thing;
1875,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Yet instruments are designed that give it the ring.
1876,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,True music that really stirs the hearts of men
1877,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That comes from the masters with the pen,"
1878,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Must be by human skill played,"
1879,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As ever behind its dress parade,"
1880,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Stands the soul of the master, flowing with the sound,"
1881,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As it comes to our ears in tones profound,"
1882,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or tintinnabulations of drum or fife,"
1883,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Calling us to war and its deadly strife;
1884,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or those mysterious strains of the violin,"
1885,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In the hands of the artist held in,"
1886,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By his neck, hands, shoulders and chin"
1887,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So none can tell where he stops for fiddle to begin;
1888,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Both moving together in such perfect time
1889,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As we sit in rapture, listening to the chime."
1890,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Will ever the sense of music in man,"
1891,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Having remained since history began,"
1892,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Be obliterated in time to come;
1893,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And his taste for sounds become numb,"
1894,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By the strain on him these machines make,"
1895,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Hounding him by their grating sleep or wake,"
1896,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By the screeching buzzes they make;
1897,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With our songs all ground up into rag,"
1898,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Even the stirring ones of the glorious flag,"
1899,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And those sedate hymns sang in church
1900,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which ragtime has sought to besmirch.
1901,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But of all of this let us not complain,"
1902,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Even if we lose our desire for the grand refrain;
1903,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Maybe some time the genius of the great,"
1904,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Will some better sense create,"
1905,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For its loss fully to compensate.

1914,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Nothing occurs new that to you I can impart
1915,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which might bring reformation in the way
1916,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,These subjects could be treated in our day.
1917,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The men of ancient times, with keen vision,"
1918,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Bent over canvas and marble with a precision
1919,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Not equalled or surpassed, marking lines of light"
1920,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And shades, bringing life and nature into full sight,"
1921,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Throwing upon cloth the earth and beclouded sky.
1922,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With its valleys green and mountains high,"
1923,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Divided into parts with ever-widening and winding streams,"
1924,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Their shores lined with foliage green and rocks in seams;
1925,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And scraggy trees, as through them the moonbeams"
1926,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Throw their mild and mellow light in shimmering sheen;
1927,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And fading lines of landscape merging into sky,"
1928,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With its diversified colors upon our watching eye;
1929,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And from the dead, cold marble stand out"
1930,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The forms of women and men showing their features and clout,"
1931,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Bringing out every expression of muscle and face,"
1932,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Revealing the thoughts and passions in lines they trace
1933,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of all the joys of life and the agonizing look,"
1934,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Even to portraying the dying groan one undertook.
1935,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To show up nature is the whole object of art;
1936,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To make the scenes natural and life impart.
1937,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now our skill in inventions throwing light,"
1938,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We absolutely copy nature and bring it out right.
1939,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Men with their skill and labor bringing out a view,"
1940,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With tinsel and touch to give it the correct hue,"
1941,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Cannot come up to daguerreotype or kodak
1942,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In throwing out the front or showing up the back.
1943,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Thus onward our wheels of progress are rolling,"
1944,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Crushing out the heart of Genius strolling
1945,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Over lands vying, with his puny hands,"
1946,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With forces of nature invention commands.
1947,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We should pause sometimes in our rapid flight,"
1948,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Long enough to reflect on the dangers that might
1949,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Wreck our civilization; children would their lives destroy
1950,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Were they allowed to handle guns as a toy;
1951,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So with man in his audacious daring
1952,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Handling these forces recklessly, caring"
1953,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Little for those who are smashed beneath their grinding,"
1954,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As the end to the glories of art they are finding.

1961,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
1962,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When my years numbered less than ten,"
1963,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I stayed with an uncle and aunt now and then,"
1964,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who lived a few miles from our own door.
1965,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now when I think of those days of yore,"
1966,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When I lingered around the cabin door,"
1967,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In rapture listening to the violin,"
1968,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Held under our old black man’s chin;
1969,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And its melody did my young heart win,"
1970,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Recollection goes back to my violin.
1971,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This old fiddle came to me in a trade,"
1972,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That I with our work-hand made;
1973,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And I learned to play for the serenade.
1974,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I rosined my bow and handled it too,"
1975,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And loved this fiddle the whole day through.
1976,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I played it nights before I went to sleep;
1977,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Rolled it in flannel its tone to keep;
1978,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Put it in the box which I did make;
1979,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And took it out mornings soon as I’d wake.
1980,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"My aunt, who lived at the house where I went,"
1981,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With whom I stayed and many hours spent
1982,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Was of the old school in the ideas she had;
1983,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The most things I thought good she deemed bad.
1984,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A deck of cards would have made her collapse;
1985,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And for amusements now offered chaps,"
1986,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They’d been abomination in her very sight;
1987,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The fiddle she thought her soul would blight.
1988,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And even the box it was carried in,"
1989,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Was contaminated with the ghost of the violin.
1990,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This vile thing was played for the dance,"
1991,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And that made it the horror of my aunt’s.
1992,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of all this I was then in ignorant bliss.
1993,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So feeling good, I did not want to miss"
1994,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The chance to show my aunt how I did play
1995,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,On my fine instrument with much display.
1996,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So carefully boxing it up, I took it to stay"
1997,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"At the home of my aunt, to whom I’d show"
1998,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,My performance with the fiddle and bow.
1999,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When I arrived she greeted me before she did see,"
2000,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,What was under the seat in the buggy with me.
2001,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When I pulled it out I plainly saw
2002,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A cloud come over her as she stood in awe.
2003,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,She did not at that time speak her full mind
2004,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But in memory lingering now I find
2005,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,She said to herself something or other
2006,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To the effect that my father and mother,"
2007,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who were her sister, and in law her brother,"
2008,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Didn’t have the same care for their child,"
2009,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As she did for hers, or else how could they defile"
2010,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A little boy like me with such a tool of evil
2011,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Specially devoted to sin and the service of the devil.
2012,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I took my poor fiddle and lugged it to my room,"
2013,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where I did not string it up so very soon.
2014,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But on one rainy day I took it out to play
2015,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Strains of old hymns that in my memory lay.
2016,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The thunder’s crash and the lightning’s play
2017,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Could not from my aunt keep away
2018,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The penetrating sound my violin bore,"
2019,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Only a moment and she was at my door.
2020,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I saw in horror my aunt stand before,"
2021,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With uplifted hands as her eyes bore,"
2022,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Riveting me in silence to the floor.
2023,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The anger, pity, grief, fear and pain"
2024,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In her face made upon me its lasting stain.
2025,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In words not spoken as much as shrieked,"
2026,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,She revealed why her face was streaked
2027,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With the lines I saw when she appeared:
2028,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“Put that horrid thing away,” she whispered;"
2029,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“Put it in the back closet and lock the door.”
2030,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"She insisted: “Hide it quick, I implore;"
2031,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The Lord in his wrath will blow the house o’er!
2032,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t you know better than to tempt God in that way,"
2033,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While the lightning and thunder His power display?”
2034,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I admit that I did not know, but in my heart,"
2035,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then tender in years, was lodged a dart"
2036,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It took years to remove; even now when I start
2037,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon my new violin some music to play
2038,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I wonder sometimes if in some mysterious way
2039,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"There is not lurking in it some demon still,"
2040,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Its tones and notes sound so awfully shrill.
2041,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I would not for a single moment profane
2042,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The memory of my dear aunt I still retain,"
2043,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Nor at her sincere beliefs cast one single slur.
2044,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,I write here what did actually occur.
2045,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A coolness between me and the fiddle I love
2046,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sprang up from the incident related above,"
2047,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That lasted all the days of my youth
2048,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When I might have learned the violin in truth;
2049,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That instrument none can ever master,"
2050,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who does not cling to it in every disaster.
2051,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2052,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2053,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2054,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2055,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Scientific Ethics
2056,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2057,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2058,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Having now had with you our several quarrels
2059,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We advance our lance to the subject of morals.
2060,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Ethics is a theme from which I can glean
2061,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some substantial hopes for a better day;
2062,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When, with our prejudices all put away,"
2063,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We shall all learn to act and think the things,"
2064,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which keep in view the good life to us brings.
2065,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While this subject is as plain as a b c
2066,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The same for some reason you fail to see.
2067,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Morals are the manners and customs one adopts
2068,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For himself in private life, while he hops,"
2069,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or walks and talks with his fellow men.
2070,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Good morals are good habits and bad, bad."
2071,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Habits are easily made, and when once had,"
2072,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They are hard to break for anybody’s sake.
2073,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The “stream of thought” seems the road to take,"
2074,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where it once had run anywhere under the sun.
2075,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Morals are the acts of which life is composed
2076,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That we have upon ourselves imposed.
2077,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This definition was made by Immanuel Kant,"
2078,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But as it is self evident, he needn’t want,"
2079,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All the credit to claim if I use the same.
2080,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Laws cause you do as others compel you;
2081,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Ethics cause you to do what you like to.
2082,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,There are only two things that push us along.
2083,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Think about it till you rack your brains,"
2084,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And you’ll find them always pleasures and pains.
2085,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Some even take pleasure in their sorrow and grief;
2086,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And you’d not be thanked for offering a relief;
2087,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nor for producing a balm to heal their wounds,"
2088,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"From which they suffered, regardless of their grounds."
2089,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Men, of their humility have been so proud;"
2090,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That lugubriously, they’d stand up in any crowd;"
2091,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or with their heads bowed and on bended knees,"
2092,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With the pride of their humbleness you they’d freeze.
2093,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The pleasures we desire and the pains we shun,"
2094,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Were our only motives since the world begun.
2095,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now keep this in mind as its use you’ll find,"
2096,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As we treat of ethics and its motives behind.
2097,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“Self-imposed precepts” are not the moral code,"
2098,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Prevalent in places where men their guns load,"
2099,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To meet a fellow man in the public road,"
2100,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To try out the question with bullets of lead,"
2101,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On the field of honor, till one or both are dead;"
2102,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nor is it the legal code enacted by man,"
2103,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Making rules against things under ban.
2104,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Morals deal with acts men actually intend,"
2105,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Those motions adapted to some end.
2106,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"“The wild gesticulations of a lunatic,”"
2107,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or of a crazy man who automatically throws a brick,"
2108,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Bear no relation to the discussion of ethics.
2109,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The standards of morals take their hue
2110,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From the aims of life men hold in view.
2111,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The pessimist says life’s a failure entire,"
2112,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So to meet the demands his views require,"
2113,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A scheme of acts adapted to shortening life
2114,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To get this set soonest out of the strife,"
2115,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And all the sad and tragic things,"
2116,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The whole of existence to them brings,"
2117,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Would be the highest standard of acts,"
2118,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Which in goodness one for them enacts.
2119,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The optimist takes a very different view,"
2120,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Life’s a pleasure while he its joys pursue.
2121,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For him a general life suited to make,"
2122,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Life long, broad and deep for his sake,"
2123,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Would be a good banner at him to shake.
2124,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So we say, bad morals are bad, and good, good."
2125,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The reason the subject by you is not understood,"
2126,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is, that while you must surely know,"
2127,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You constantly misapply to ethics one word as you go.
2128,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The meaning of this word if you don’t get,"
2129,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is from stupidity, for you never yet"
2130,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Went into a store anything to buy or even try,"
2131,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But a practical demonstration was before your eye.
2132,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The first thing you ask about a razor or knife,"
2133,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is this, “Is it good?” and the clerk doesn’t cry,"
2134,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“What do you mean!” if he wants you to buy.
2135,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He politely answers, “Both these tools cut good,"
2136,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As they are warranted, one whiskers, and one wood,"
2137,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And both of them do their part very good.”
2138,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If one of you farmers wished to acquire a cow,"
2139,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You wouldn’t ask whether she could make a bow;
2140,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You would enquire how much milk she gave,"
2141,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And how much butter, and could she save"
2142,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You some expense in the way she’d behave.
2143,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If such questions had all been left out,"
2144,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the seller had known what he was about,"
2145,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He’d said, “She’s good,” and everything’s understood."
2146,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If a female reader went to buy a new spring hat,"
2147,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the thing was in style, you would close your chat."
2148,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If it was in style, it’s good, every fool knows that,"
2149,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The bargain’s made and the hat charged to pap.
2150,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The same thing is true of skirts and hoops,"
2151,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of dogs and cats, and chickens in coops;"
2152,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You can’t look about or run around,"
2153,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Without understanding this word always so profound,"
2154,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And mysterious when applied to my theme;
2155,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With yawning face you almost dream,"
2156,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And look confused when I try to tell what I mean.
2157,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"You never ask about any of the things I’ve spoke,"
2158,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whether they say their prayers and never joke,"
2159,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To speak of such, you at me your fun poke."
2160,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now we’ll see whether you are sensible folk,"
2161,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When you try to shed your customary cloak
2162,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of prejudice and mysticism you croak,"
2163,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Every time you try sense to ethics to apply.
2164,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Common sense teaches us there is no reason why,"
2165,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The definition will not fit conduct every whit,"
2166,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As it did other things about which I’ve writ.
2167,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Conduct is good if its ends come through,"
2168,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And its natural results are good for me and you.
2169,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"I take the optimist’s view, life’s a blessing,"
2170,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And when to you my words I’m addressing,"
2171,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Say whether I’m right in possessing,"
2172,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The notion that acts are morally right and good,"
2173,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That contribute to life as above understood.
2174,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In its thickness, breadth and length, all those things,"
2175,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Which happiness achieve, diminishing man’s stings."
2176,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Before us examples have been set by teachers,"
2177,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By Immanuel Kant better than preachers;
2178,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That each one of our actions should lofty be,"
2179,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That each would be a model for a code of morality.
2180,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This form of hedonism I would gladly place
2181,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Before the eyes of the whole human race.
2182,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Asceticism is a term derived from the Greek,"
2183,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Applied to monks, signifying the exercises they seek,"
2184,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By which they distinguish themselves in that they do,"
2185,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For favor with the deity in the lines they pursue,"
2186,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Away from their fellow man as much as they can.
2187,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Virtue is a term originally meaning prowess,"
2188,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And as applied to bravery they did possess;
2189,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It aroused the ancients to courage in distress.
2190,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When the Old Bard sang “the wrath
2191,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of Peleus’ son against those in his path;
2192,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When his armies did advance with spear and lance,"
2193,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Against the Trojans against whom he did advance;
2194,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or of him sulking in his tent, nursing his spleen"
2195,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Against tall Agamemnon for acts in being mean
2196,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Towards him in regard to a captive maid
2197,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon whom he had his affections laid.”
2198,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And all the bloody deeds done by gods and men,"
2199,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Breathing anger from their nostrils when
2200,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Upon each other their darts they did hurl,"
2201,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And in the dust many bleeding bodies did curl;
2202,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As these savage men struggled for their prize;
2203,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To their gods whole hecatombs did they sacrifice
2204,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of poor dumb brutes that could not sympathize
2205,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With them in their bloody wars and heroic cries.
2206,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Out of virtue as thus defined did arise
2207,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Asceticism and all the horrid tortures it did devise.
2208,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Even now men are so wedded to their inspired books
2209,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And things written in them by ancients where one looks
2210,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To find every act for you and me so well defined
2211,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That they claim that all experience combined,"
2212,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Cannot those precepts change to suit the age;
2213,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Although we point out inconsistency on every page.
2214,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"They even allege that what by their book is said,"
2215,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Makes things good or bad under each particular head.
2216,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That even as simple a thing as theft,"
2217,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If out of their book the subject were left,"
2218,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,There would be nothing in our practical observation
2219,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To distinguish whether or not stealing was a proper avocation.
2220,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whatever of man’s moral nature the origin may be,"
2221,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whether he was created with a certain propensity,"
2222,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or whether our tendencies are a matter of growth;
2223,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"One thing is certain, and needs not any oath,"
2224,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To prove that our several tastes may be improved,"
2225,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To treat our fellow man as it him behoved;
2226,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And toward ourselves the truer to be,"
2227,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Until our standards and the right did agree.
2228,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If all the acts that you and I must do,"
2229,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Were written into mandates constantly held in view,"
2230,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And we should follow them all the way through,"
2231,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We still would be nothing but very slaves,"
2232,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Marching under orders of some specially wise knaves.
2233,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now if one in what he does, lives to the very top,"
2234,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of his own ideals, him we cannot stop,"
2235,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Until for him his ideas we raise; he is up to full speed,"
2236,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For the requirements of all are not if the same meed.
2237,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Most of man’s motions should be left to his whims,"
2238,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Whether he rides or walks, or even swims."
2239,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Moral conduct being by each self imposed,"
2240,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The acts men do will naturally be disclosed,"
2241,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the things they like in the tastes disclosed.
2242,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When the acts of men are ruled by laws enacted,"
2243,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From the category of ethics they are subtracted.
2244,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"No human motions should be forced or restrained,"
2245,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Unless the welfare of others is to be attained.
2246,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In some general sense, everything I do,"
2247,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To a limited extent, has its natural effect on you."
2248,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By two meeting in the road, one of us must turn,"
2249,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To let the other pass or his rig might overturn.
2250,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By breathing the air some oxygen I must consume,"
2251,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Also infecting what remains by what I exhume.
2252,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When in the market I buy my daily supplies,"
2253,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That alone has a tendency to make the price rise;
2254,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So that you have to pay more for your store.
2255,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Thus in many and varied ways our motions bear
2256,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some natural disadvantages we should all share,"
2257,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In our relations each with each as we live everywhere.
2258,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Any physical fact, however simple it may look,"
2259,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"May change aspect by the turns it took,"
2260,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Showing how the morality of any motion,"
2261,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"May appear and disappear, simply by the notion"
2262,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We have about those unseen motives in its track
2263,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Preceding, going with, or following it back."
2264,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In presence of ladies a man takes off his hat,"
2265,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To show respect for them and nothing but that.
2266,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The morality of this act is not hard to adjust.
2267,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The same gentleman to brush away the dust,"
2268,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Takes off the same hat in perfect disgust.
2269,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In each case the taking off the hat was in view.
2270,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The one act was moral, while the other it’s true,"
2271,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With the question of ethics had nothing to do.
2272,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He now takes off his hat at the command of the law,"
2273,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the presence of the court where he waits in awe.
2274,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Being tired of the hat, he takes it off to sell,"
2275,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now the above illustration you know so well,"
2276,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That its application I’ll leave you to spell.
2277,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,“Nothing’s good or bad but the thinking makes it so.”
2278,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Behold the beauty of ethics, let us make it grow."
2279,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If you want plants to thrive, cultivate the soil,"
2280,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t over fertilize, or you will make them spoil."
2281,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We may stimulate our desires for good morals,"
2282,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And our desire for good deeds, even by quarrels."
2283,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We may over stimulate the passions of the youth,"
2284,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Even when trying upon them to impress the truth.
2285,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By unduly stimulating their appetite for gains,"
2286,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And their desires for pleasures without enduring the pains;
2287,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And by excess their natures may be changed.
2288,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In that way we destroy their faculty to enjoy,"
2289,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The real blessings of life born of strife.
2290,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Rewards and punishments for acts and omissions,"
2291,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are causes for delinquencies and its commissions.
2292,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Both have their way their victims to sway,"
2293,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From the natural paths of right every day.
2294,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Every good act brings its consequential pay
2295,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And every wrong act its own punishment,"
2296,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon all who upon mischief are always bent.
2297,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But to add to the natural consequence of things,"
2298,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Which their performance usually brings,"
2299,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"This over pay in the nature of rewards,"
2300,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Drives one on until the pay alone he regards,"
2301,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the nature of crimes fades out of view,"
2302,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While the punishment alone is considered by you.
2303,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Thus on we are naturally driven from our path,"
2304,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Straying out of the right and the pleasures it hath.
2305,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Most of our motions should be left open to choice
2306,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To develop our selective faculties in acts and voice,"
2307,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That make us kind and fellows to rejoice.
2308,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A certain kind of approval we feel,"
2309,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That might be compared to the scent flowers yield,"
2310,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Upon the doing or even contemplation of acts.
2311,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"There is also a stifling sensation coming about,"
2312,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The doing of things about which there is a doubt,"
2313,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As to whether we ought, although never found out,"
2314,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Think, do, or pursue the thing we’re about."
2315,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Conscience is the name applied
2316,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To this moving feeling with our faculties allied.
2317,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And some say it is a true moral guide.
2318,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But experience finds conscience in this plight,"
2319,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It approves everything we think to be right,"
2320,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And condemns all things in our sight,"
2321,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That even from ignorance we deem wrong that may be right.
2322,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For conscience’ sake many have been burned at the stake,"
2323,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To appease its gnawings, and thirst for blood to slake."
2324,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Gored by its pricks, Hindu mothers, their own babes,"
2325,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In innocence swathed, into the seething waves,"
2326,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of the River Ganges, writhing, religiously they fling,"
2327,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"While to this river god their hymns they sing,"
2328,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Galled by conscience the monk and anchorite,"
2329,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In dark caves, out of human sight,"
2330,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Tear their flesh and do themselves every spite
2331,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To humiliate themselves in heaven’s sight.
2332,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"What a freak conscience has proved to be,"
2333,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is illustrated in a story by Heinrich Heine,"
2334,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of a certain judge in a certain state,"
2335,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Having condemned eight hundred by his mandate,"
2336,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To be burned at the stake for witchcraft,"
2337,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,One day conscience threw at him its own shaft.
2338,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He imagined too that he was guilty of the crime,"
2339,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That so many others had been during his time.
2340,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So to quiet his conscience he paid the fine;
2341,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And having declared himself guilty, did resign,"
2342,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And purge his soul in punishment condign.
2343,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Conscience may help us our morals to regulate,"
2344,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But first of all, we must our conscience educate,"
2345,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By educating the head by which it is led.
2346,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Know the right and do it too as best you can
2347,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And conscience will aid you to be a man.
2348,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To learn the right, and it pursue,"
2349,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Read all books and observe the actions of man,"
2350,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Acquire by your own experience all you can;
2351,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Value conduct as you would value your goods,"
2352,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Digest the subject as you do your foods,"
2353,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Always keeping in view that present good,"
2354,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is often best achieved, when understood,"
2355,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By enduring pains now to prepare us for pleasures,"
2356,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the days to come in greater measures.
2357,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"After all, the art which makes life a success"
2358,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In blessing those we love to bless,"
2359,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is to find th’ equilibrium of pleasures and pains,"
2360,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As we do our business losses and gains.
2361,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Altruism is a word by Auguste Compte made,"
2362,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Meaning regard for others, which he truly said,"
2363,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We should cultivate and human love assimilate.
2364,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Sometimes the best thing for others we can do,"
2365,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is not to worry them, but our own course pursue,"
2366,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And to ourselves be true, and they’ll pull through."
2367,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2368,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2369,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2370,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2371,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Sunday Laws
2372,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2373,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2374,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Having enjoyed our quarrels, before we pause,"
2375,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let us take a look at your Sunday laws.
2376,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In olden time Sabbath breaking was a crime
2377,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of such deep hue, that if anything you do"
2378,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On that blessed day, even to earn a dime,"
2379,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By shoveling snow, just about the time,"
2380,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,You begin to know that you must explore
2381,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,For a little bread to keep wolf from your door.
2382,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Now the reason they did pense, for making that offense,"
2383,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As I divine the most heinous of their time;
2384,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Was, that of all the days, it only took six,"
2385,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For God the funds to raise and no plans to mix,"
2386,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To build heaven and earth and all stars to fix;
2387,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And that the job was all finished so good,"
2388,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By sundown Saturday night, as they understood,"
2389,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That on Sunday He had nothing left to do;
2390,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So the Lord had to rest, and now must you."
2391,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If mistaken in the reasons as to me it looks,"
2392,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Plenty of Sunday laws are found in your statute books;
2393,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And you can read them all yourself,"
2394,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By taking them off their shelf.
2395,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"But all those laws have now grown so very old,"
2396,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And all the pages that them do hold,"
2397,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Are all stuck together with moss and rust,"
2398,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So that if you really and truly must,"
2399,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Take a look at them yourself to see if they are just,"
2400,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It would be better to hire some old maid or hag,"
2401,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who would supply herself with a dust brush and rag
2402,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From their pages to scrub away the mold of decay.
2403,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Every few years, say one in ten,"
2404,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Some one or two of our fanatic men,"
2405,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Or some great big oratorical fellow,"
2406,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who imagines that with all ease he can bellow,"
2407,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And scare the boys their toys to put away,"
2408,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On the holy, blessed Sabbath day."
2409,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"As once happened in my own native state,"
2410,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In almost a comparatively modern date.
2411,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,This oratorical man became prosecutor of the law;
2412,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And he began in earnest to apply his jaw.
2413,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He gave us such a jar, that it was hard a cigar,"
2414,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or even a loaf of bread to get near or far.
2415,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Finally this one did his feathers plume,"
2416,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And a race for Congress he began to assume;
2417,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Thinking that trip he could easily fly.
2418,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We then commenced to sing “as in days gone by,”"
2419,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Before he was walking about our doors stalking,"
2420,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Upon our heads to precipitate his wrath,"
2421,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To keep us all in the old straight and narrow path.
2422,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In not such an awfully long time, we awoke to find,"
2423,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That by somebody’s nudge, our man was criminal judge."
2424,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Dead sure now was he that he could scare all the boys away
2425,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"From everything that looked like work or even play,"
2426,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"On the Sabbath day, and being in the lurch,"
2427,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Haply a number would stumble into church,"
2428,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When the choir began to sing and the coin to ring
2429,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In the collection box handed around by a sly fox.
2430,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Criminal informations for men in every station,"
2431,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who in his estimation, were the Sabbath breaking,"
2432,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the church forsaking, issued from his court,"
2433,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Patiently did the folks go their bails,"
2434,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And barely kept them out of our jails,"
2435,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Till the humane change of venue came:
2436,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Then alas for his fame, nothing but blame,"
2437,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For his services lent, and the people’s money spent."
2438,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By simple non-use laws may die, in the public eye."
2439,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When they go out of date, there is no need to legislate;"
2440,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They are always considered as off the slate.
2441,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So let all our captives out with joy and glee,"
2442,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And let us learn one thing from the Man of Galilee,"
2443,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That the Sabbath was made for man.
2444,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2445,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2446,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2447,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2448,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,True Religion
2449,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2450,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2451,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To work and love and live and do
2452,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"For others as for oneself, in my view,"
2453,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Would be a good religion for me and for you.
2454,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To help ourselves and others to educate,"
2455,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That all false pride, selfishness and hate,"
2456,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Come from ignorance and is not innate.
2457,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It is born of the admiration some bestow
2458,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,On fools who parade around to make a show
2459,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of their wealth, and also the clothes they wear,"
2460,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Thinking themselves too good our company to share.
2461,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"’Tis not the books we read, nor the speed,"
2462,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That we travel, nor our boasted creed;"
2463,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"’Tis not the strength we have to believe,"
2464,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All the tales that from others we receive;
2465,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Nor the ugly faces we make when we grieve;
2466,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Nor those long drawn out sighs we heave;
2467,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Nor even the sorrow we feel for crimes,"
2468,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Committed away back in ancient times,"
2469,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By Adam and Eve among their vines
2470,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of the lovely Garden of Eden
2471,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Where before there was not a weed in.
2472,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Go to church if you please, don your bonnet and hike,"
2473,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Take a front seat or sit with the choir if you like,"
2474,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Invite others too, but don’t frown if they do"
2475,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Let you go by yourself if they want you.
2476,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When you see a brother come to great grief,"
2477,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Don’t take that chance to give yourself relief,"
2478,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Of a burden you’ve carried to get a chance
2479,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To heave at him while down, your pious lance;"
2480,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Put your arms around his neck, his pains to check,"
2481,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And take some other time his sins to inspect.
2482,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Put your money in the missionary field,"
2483,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"To send to all China and all around you feel,"
2484,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Like saving them from their idols to whom they kneel;
2485,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Spread yourself on land and sea to get them in the band;
2486,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All this you do and have not charity,"
2487,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And your religion is not right for me.
2488,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Cut out Sunday, sin, satan and hell,"
2489,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Leave the gods up where they are wont to dwell;
2490,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Change all of your songs about heaven above
2491,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To things upon our earth and human love;
2492,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Put off your mourning, lugubrious whine"
2493,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And think of man as the one divine;
2494,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Learn to talk and walk and act
2495,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As if man’s freedom was a real fact.
2496,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Let your parsons take off their gowns,"
2497,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And smooth out all their wrinkly frowns;
2498,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And preach about potatoes, corn and hay,"
2499,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Just as if folks on earth intended to stay.
2500,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Let deacons and monks and all their crew,"
2501,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Find work for themselves to toil and do;
2502,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Use all your churches, temples and spires,"
2503,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,According to man’s natural and ordinary desires;
2504,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Stop talking about inspired books and creeds,"
2505,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But show your faith by human thoughts and deeds.
2506,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Immaculate conception and total depravity,"
2507,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are entirely too heavy for mortal’s gravity;
2508,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Baptism, holy unction, and the new birth divine,"
2509,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are elements in which gods alone may shine.
2510,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"All our superstitions and fears and shame,"
2511,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Originate in reverence for some holy name,"
2512,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Burned into man by torch, faggot and flame."
2513,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Prophets, priests and seers of old,"
2514,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"So long their marvellous tales have told,"
2515,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That none on earth but the reckless and old,"
2516,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,A doubt against them dare to hold.
2517,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Their ancient books and maps and charts,"
2518,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are indelibly branded upon our hearts.
2519,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From childhood hour at chime of bell
2520,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All congregate to hear the preacher tell
2521,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of the garden of Eden where the serpent bold,"
2522,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To our first mother did his story unfold;
2523,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, that fascinated by that shiny snake,"
2524,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"She has doomed us all to the burning lake,"
2525,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With no water our scorching thirst to slake.
2526,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"He tells us too with all his might and main,"
2527,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That for our crimes the pensive one was slain;
2528,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And that by his death on the cruel cross,"
2529,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We may recoup our first mother’s loss.
2530,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That all are bound in the chains of sin,"
2531,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Steeped in iniquity she did begin,"
2532,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"By that headlong fall our mother Eve fell,"
2533,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And, unless we believe the tales they tell,"
2534,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Our lot will be cast with the damned in hell.
2535,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2536,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2537,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2538,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2539,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Immortality
2540,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2541,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,(A Digression.)
2542,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2543,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2544,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When for us our eyes are closed in silent sleep,"
2545,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And over our rigid body is spread the sheet,"
2546,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,While loved ones around us sob and weep.
2547,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,When in black our form is shrouded;
2548,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And taken to some church all crowded,"
2549,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Our last rites to receive at loving hands,"
2550,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Who over our coffin wreathe their garlands
2551,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Of flowers, whose fragrance perfume"
2552,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"The air, while loving hearts with song attune,"
2553,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,The stillness to break in hymns of hope;
2554,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And the speaker in his talk to cope
2555,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With human grief and doubts and fears,"
2556,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Says consoling words to dry up our tears.
2557,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When in our grave, made with pick and spade,"
2558,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Our embalmed body is solemnly laid;
2559,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Does that end us all and all our parade?
2560,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is that all of life to end in dust?
2561,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From which our body came once robust?
2562,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Or will there come some unseen power
2563,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Our lost life to restore in some distant hour,"
2564,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,By some loud trumpet blast us awake
2565,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,From deep sleep our slumber to break?
2566,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Who pines the answer to know,"
2567,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"May have to wait, or the knowledge forego."
2568,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Science teaches that what of life we see,"
2569,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In man as in vegetation, shrub and tree,"
2570,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Are manifestations of acts the body performs.
2571,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That mystic thing called “thought” man’s life adorns,"
2572,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Is but the throbbing of the active brain.
2573,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That each lobe and part of the brain,"
2574,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Responds to particular senses we feel.
2575,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"One convolution smells, one hears, one sees;"
2576,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"One urges locomotion, or brings us to our knees;"
2577,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As upon them play the subtle waves from without
2578,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Receiving the response within of what we’re about.
2579,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"If all this be true, how can it be"
2580,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"That when this machine is destroyed as we see,"
2581,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,That these results can obtain thus set free.
2582,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"When the grey matter of the brain is back in dust,"
2583,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Into its original atoms rudely thrust.
2584,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Unless it be that life itself is a thing apart,"
2585,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And the brain, nerves and throbbing heart,"
2586,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Are but the instruments through which it plays,"
2587,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And when this body in which it now stays,"
2588,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"With all of its parts, is dead and gone,"
2589,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Another new body shall us adorn.
2590,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,They tell us such things in a book divine;
2591,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And that this new body shall shine,"
2592,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Forever amid the stars and in glory shall walk,"
2593,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Around a throne and to the king shall talk;
2594,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"And that under the shade of the tree of life,"
2595,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Find eternal peace free from toil and strife.
2596,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2597,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2598,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2599,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2600,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Death
2601,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2602,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,
2603,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Death always strikes with a terrific blow,"
2604,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Because it drives us to where we do not know.
2605,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All the saddened past has been filled with a guess.
2606,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Ages have been spent in trying to relieve its distress.
2607,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Men have sought magic and the spells it casts
2608,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,To answer questions and all inquiries of death asked.
2609,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Yet, after all, we simply know that it is the fate"
2610,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We all must equally share with those we love or hate.
2611,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Life is but a short story for us when it is told;
2612,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Its brief animation for the young and for the old
2613,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is only an agitation, a ripple on the waves of time."
2614,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"A few joys, a few sorrows, a few thoughts sublime"
2615,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,As onward we speed into the Great Beyond unknown.
2616,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Could we but open the doors and see the paths strown
2617,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,With all the remains of the billions before us thrown
2618,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Into the gaping jaws of death, devouring its own,"
2619,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We might then unravel its mysteries deep,"
2620,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,We might then have visions of those who sleep;
2621,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,But into that vast chasm none are allowed to peep.
2622,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Vain it is to pry into this oblivion profound,"
2623,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Vain to attempt its hidden meaning to expound;
2624,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Vain to ask why the hungry jaws of this Monster Great
2625,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Does not spare our loved ones, why he should immolate"
2626,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Kings in palaces and peasants in huts of want,"
2627,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Babes in cradles and aged ones lean and gaunt.
2628,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,If we are inevitably doomed to this common end;
2629,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Should we fear when towards it our journeys tend?
2630,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We cannot shun it by fear or by hope,"
2631,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"We must meet it, and with its pangs must cope."
2632,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,In which ever way our winding paths may lead
2633,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Death faces us with its devastating looks of greed.
2634,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It comes to us in a thousand different ways;
2635,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It visits us at night when the sun has hid its rays;
2636,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,It greets us at noonday when the sun is high;
2637,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,No one can escape its ever-vigilant eye;
2638,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,All the living must yield up to it and die.
2639,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is death a curse, then all the living are cursed;"
2640,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Is death a blessing, then all the living will be blessed."
2641,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"It cannot be an evil, nature creates nothing wrong;"
2642,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And it is only nature while we follow it along.
2643,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Mother earth brings us all into this life;
2644,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And this same mother calls us back from its strife.
2645,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Can it be that our mother would be unkind?
2646,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"In a universal mother, universal love we find."
2647,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Although her children be numbered by millions;
2648,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,And all her numberless offspring run into billions;
2649,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Yet no partiality she shows; all are treated the same;
2650,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,"Her rules are based on fate, break them and bear the blame."
2651,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,How could her laws be varied to suit her flock?
2652,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,Anarchy would reign and destroy her stock.
2653,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,One universal law; death waits us all;
2654,REUBEN BRODIE GARNETT.,So let us be courageous while we wait its call.
