153,JACK ROSE,
154,JACK ROSE,With crafty brooding life turned to Jack Rose
155,JACK ROSE,"And made him heroin-peddler, and his pose"
156,JACK ROSE,Was sullenly reflective since he feared
157,JACK ROSE,"That life, regarding him, had merely jeered."
158,JACK ROSE,His vanity was small and could not call
159,JACK ROSE,His egoism to the dubious hall
160,JACK ROSE,"Of fame, where average artists spend their hour."
161,JACK ROSE,Doubting his powers he was forced to cower
162,JACK ROSE,"Within the shrill, damp alleys of his time,"
163,JACK ROSE,Immersed in that brisk midnight known as crime.
164,JACK ROSE,He shunned the fiercely shrewd stuff that he sold
165,JACK ROSE,"To other people, and derived a cold"
166,JACK ROSE,Enjoyment from the writhing of their hearts.
167,JACK ROSE,"A speechless artist, he admired the arts"
168,JACK ROSE,"Of blundering destruction, like a monk"
169,JACK ROSE,Viewing a play that made him mildly drunk.
170,JACK ROSE,And so malicious and ascetic Jack
171,JACK ROSE,Bent to his trade with a relentless back
172,JACK ROSE,Until he tapped an unexpected smile--
173,JACK ROSE,A woman’s smile as smooth and hard as tile.
174,JACK ROSE,May Bulger pawned her flesh to him and gave
175,JACK ROSE,"His heroin to her brother, with a grave"
176,JACK ROSE,Reluctance fumbling at her painted lips.
177,JACK ROSE,"Though angry at herself, she took the whips"
178,JACK ROSE,"Of undesired love, to quiet a boy"
179,JACK ROSE,Who wept inanely for his favorite toy.
180,JACK ROSE,She hated Jack because he failed to gloss
181,JACK ROSE,"And soften the rough surface of her loss,"
182,JACK ROSE,His matter-of-fact frown biting at her heart.
183,JACK ROSE,He hated her because her smiling guess
184,JACK ROSE,"Had robbed him of ascetic loneliness,"
185,JACK ROSE,"And when her brother died, Jack sat beside"
186,JACK ROSE,Her grief and played a mouth-harp while she cried.
187,JACK ROSE,But when she raised her head and smiled at him--
188,JACK ROSE,A smile intensely stripped and subtly grim--
189,JACK ROSE,"His hate felt overawed and in a trap,"
190,JACK ROSE,And suddenly his head fell to her lap.
191,JACK ROSE,"For some time she sat stiffly in the chair,"
192,JACK ROSE,Then slowly raised her hand and stroked his hair.

202,I,“Have you ever played on a violin
203,I,Larger than ten thousand stars
204,I,And warmer than what you call sin?”
205,I,"Torban, a young man from Mars,"
206,I,"Gave me the stretch of his voice,"
207,I,And my “no” fell down like a pin
208,I,On the echoed din of his words.
209,I,He said: “Then I have no choice.
210,I,I must use the barrenly involved
211,I,Words with which you have not solved
212,I,The wistful riddles of your days.
213,I,Leave the pale and ruddy herds
214,I,"Of men, with their surrendering ways,"
215,I,And come with me to Mars.”
216,I,
217,I,
218,II,II
219,II,
220,II,"Drums of Autumn beat on Mars,"
221,II,Calling our minds to reunion.
222,II,The avenues of seaweed spars
223,II,Have attained a paleness
224,II,"Equal to that of earthly philosophies,"
225,II,And the trees have lost
226,II,The diamond violence of Spring.
227,II,Their purple leaves have turned to grey
228,II,Just as a human religion
229,II,Gradually changes to pretence.
230,II,"In Mars we have only two seasons,"
231,II,Spring and Autumn--their reasons
232,II,Rest in a treacherous sun
233,II,"That suddenly runs away,"
234,II,Creating a twilight-suspense.
235,II,When the sun reappears
236,II,Mars is once more amazed
237,II,By the blazing flatteries of Spring.
238,II,Again the heavy leaves ring
239,II,With odor and light deftly pressed
240,II,Into a stormy chorus.
241,II,Then we abandon the screaming violins
242,II,"Of our minds, and each man wins"
243,II,An understanding rest.
244,II,Once more we roam and jest
245,II,"Upon the avenues, with voices"
246,II,"One shade louder than the leaves,"
247,II,Or sail upon the choral seas
248,II,And trade our words with molten ease.
249,II,Throughout the Autumn we stand
250,II,"Still and deserted, while our minds"
251,II,Leap into sweeping tensions
252,II,Blending sound and form
253,II,Into one search across the universe.
254,II,
255,II,
256,III,III
257,III,
258,III,What do we find in this search?
259,III,All of your earthly words lurch
260,III,"Feebly upon the outskirts of my mind,"
261,III,"And when they pass beyond them, they are blind."
262,III,Outward forms are but the graves
263,III,"Of sound, and all the different waves"
264,III,"Of light and odor, they are sound"
265,III,That floats unshaped and loosely gowned.
266,III,When sound is broken into parts
267,III,"Your ears receive the smaller arts,"
268,III,But when it drifts in broad release
269,III,You cannot hear its louder peace.
270,III,"Your houses, hills, and flesh of red"
271,III,"Are shapes of sound, asleep or dead."
272,III,In Mars a stronger Spring of sound
273,III,Revives our forms and makes Profound
274,III,"Music, softer than the dins"
275,III,That rose from Autumn violins.
276,III,"Our minds, whose tense excursions spread"
277,III,"In chase of noisy walls that fled,"
278,III,"Relent and drop within our heads,"
279,III,Enjoying the timid sound of their beds.
280,III,"Filled with a gracious weariness,"
281,III,"We place it, like a lighter dress,"
282,III,Upon the sounds from other stars
283,III,Brought back to celebrate on Mars.

288,IV,A girl of Mars is burning
289,IV,Notes of thought within her throat.
290,IV,Her pale white lips are turning
291,IV,The fire to storied chords.
292,IV,The song is old but often made
293,IV,By girls who sit in Spring and braid
294,IV,The lanterned language of their hair.
295,IV,Its spacious gaiety cannot be sold
296,IV,To your narrow glow of words.
297,IV,The hint that I shall give is cold
298,IV,And like the sound of snowy air.
299,IV,
300,IV,_I shall journey with the men
301,IV,When my curling thoughts are ten.
302,IV,O the sternness of that number!
303,IV,Colored sounds from breath to umber
304,IV,Promising a first release.
305,IV,I have dwelt too long in peace
306,IV,Placing smallness on my breast.
307,IV,The prisoned whisper of my skin
308,IV,Longs to vanish in the din
309,IV,Of Autumn when great sounds are caught.
310,IV,Let the tall wildness of my thought
311,IV,Stride beside the thundering grace
312,IV,Of the man whose spring-time face
313,IV,Brought me tiny notes of rest._
314,IV,
315,IV,She sits within a house of stone
316,IV,That lends a wise and balanced tone:
317,IV,A roofless house whose walls are low
318,IV,And level with her head’s grey glow.
319,IV,The bright sounds of her parents fly
320,IV,Around the house--we do not die
321,IV,"In Mars, but change to gleams of sounds"
322,IV,And stay within our gayer rounds
323,IV,Until when tired Spring has gone
324,IV,We lead the Autumn searchers on.
325,IV,"Before we change, our bodies curve"
326,IV,Like yours save that our skins are gray:
327,IV,Light shades of gray that almost swerve
328,IV,"To white, like earthly men who pray."
329,IV,

331,V,V
332,V,
333,V,We do not love and hate in Mars.
334,V,These earthly cries are flashing bars
335,V,Of sound from which our minds are free.
336,V,They stand in our mythology:
337,V,"Legends elusive and weird,"
338,V,Acrid Gods that once were feared.
339,V,They vanished imperceptibly
340,V,And none among us can agree
341,V,Upon the tangled way in which they fled.
342,V,"Starlit symbols of dread,"
343,V,They slowly exhausted themselves and died
344,V,In striding heralds of a wilder bride.
345,V,We have no emotions in Mars.
346,V,They are like long-healed wounds
347,V,Whose scars are softened by the gleam of our minds.
348,V,We approach them with clearer kinds
349,V,Of sound from deeply resting thought.
350,V,Our youths and maidens have not caught
351,V,The treacherous and tightly bound
352,V,"Confusion of your loving sound,"
353,V,For sex to us is but the ring
354,V,Of different shades of thought in Spring
355,V,When men recline upon the breast
356,V,"Of women, dissolving into thoughtful rest."
357,V,In Autumn sex is left behind.
358,V,Men and women no longer lined
359,V,By different bodies raise their dins
360,V,Above the screaming violins.

373,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Aided by the impersonal boredom
374,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Of a morgue at evening.
375,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The morgue divides its whole
376,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Of dead mens’ contacts into four
377,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"Parts, and places one in each"
378,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Of these four bodies waiting for the carts.
379,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The frankness of their decay
380,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Breaks into contradictory symbols
381,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"And sits erect upon the wooden tables,"
382,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Thus cancelling the validity of time.
383,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,In a voice as passive as slime
384,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The negro speaks.
385,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,“Killed a woman: ripped her skin.
386,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Saw her heart floating in a tumbler of gin.
387,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Had to drink her heart because it wouldn’t leave the gin.
388,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Because I wanted to reach all of her
389,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,They ripped my flesh.
390,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,They wanted to reach all of me
391,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,And their excuse was better than mine.”
392,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"Cowed baby painted black,"
393,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The negro sits upon fundamentals
394,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,And troubles them a little with his hands.
395,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The beautiful insanity
396,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Of his eyes rebukes
397,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The common void of his face.
398,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Then the Chinaman speaks
399,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,In a voice whose tones are brass
400,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,From which emotion has been extracted.
401,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,“Loved a woman: she was white.
402,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Her man blew my brains out into the night.
403,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Hatred is afraid of color.
404,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Color is the holiday
405,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Given to moods of understanding:
406,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Hatred does not understand.
407,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,When stillness ends the fever of ideas
408,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Hatred will be a scarcely remembered spark.”
409,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Manikin at peace
410,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"With the matchless deceit of a planet,"
411,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The Chinaman fashions his placid immensity.
412,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The Chinaman chides his insignificance
413,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,With a more impressive rapture
414,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Than that of western midgets.
415,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,His rapture provides an excellent light
416,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,For the silhouette of the negro’s curse.
417,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Then the white servant-girl
418,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Speaks in a voice whose syllables
419,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"Fall like dripping flower-juice and offal,"
420,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Both producing a similar sound.
421,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,“I made a neat rug for a man.
422,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,He cleaned his feet on me and I liked
423,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"The tired, scheming way in which he did it."
424,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,When he finished he decided
425,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"That he needed a smoother texture,"
426,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,And found another lady.
427,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,I killed myself because I couldn’t rub out
428,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The cunning marks that he left behind.”
429,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Impulsive doll made of rubbish

431,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"The white servant-girl, without question or answer,"
432,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Accepts the jest of a universe.
433,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Then the Russian woman
434,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Speaks in a voice that is heat
435,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Ill-at-ease upon its couch of sound.
436,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,“I married a man because
437,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,His lips tormented my melancholy
438,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"And made it long to be meek,"
439,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"And because, when he walked to his office each morning,"
440,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,He thought himself a kindled devil
441,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Enduring the smaller figures around him.
442,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,He abandoned me for German intrigue
443,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"And I chased him in other men,"
444,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Never quite designing him.
445,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"Death, a better megalomaniac,"
446,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Relieved me of the pursuit.”
447,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Symbol of earth delighted
448,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"With the vibration of its nerves,"
449,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The Russian woman sunders life
450,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Into amusing deities of emotion
451,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,And bestows a hurried worship.
452,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"Then the morgue, attended by a whim,"
453,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Slays the intonations of their trance
454,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,And slips these people back to life.
455,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The air is cut by transformation.
456,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,The white servant-girl retreats to a corner
457,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"With a shriek, while the negro advances,"
458,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,And the Russian woman
459,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Nervously objects to the Chinaman’s question.
460,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,"The morgue, weary housewife for speechless decay,"
461,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Spends its helplessness in gay revenge:
462,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Revenge of earth upon four manikins
463,TURMOIL IN A MORGUE,Who straightened up on wooden tables

835,GEROID LATOUR,"Death,"
836,GEROID LATOUR,"Grandiosely hackneyed subject,"
837,GEROID LATOUR,I live in a house one hundred years old
838,GEROID LATOUR,Placed in the middle of a cemetery.
839,GEROID LATOUR,The cemetery is bothered by mausoleums
840,GEROID LATOUR,Where fragments of Greek and Gothic
841,GEROID LATOUR,Lie in orderly shame.
842,GEROID LATOUR,Slabs and crosses of stone
843,GEROID LATOUR,Remain unacquainted with the bones
844,GEROID LATOUR,That they must strive to introduce.
845,GEROID LATOUR,The trees retain their guiltless sibilants.
846,GEROID LATOUR,The trees tell me upon my morning walk:
847,GEROID LATOUR,"“In other cemeteries,"
848,GEROID LATOUR,"Shakespeare, Maeterlinck and Shaw"
849,GEROID LATOUR,Fail to produce the slightest awe
850,GEROID LATOUR,In trees that do not create for an audience.”
851,GEROID LATOUR,"Being finalities, the grass and trees"
852,GEROID LATOUR,Find no need for rules of etiquette.
853,GEROID LATOUR,Delicacy must be effortless
854,GEROID LATOUR,Or else it changes to a patched-up dress.
855,GEROID LATOUR,But delicate and coarse are words
856,GEROID LATOUR,"For quickness that tries to linger,"
857,GEROID LATOUR,And slowness that strives to be fast!
858,GEROID LATOUR,Emotions and thoughts are merely
859,GEROID LATOUR,"The improvisations of motion,"
860,GEROID LATOUR,And lack a permanent content.
861,GEROID LATOUR,An aging tree is wiser

864,GEROID LATOUR,The scale ascends out of sight

867,GEROID LATOUR,The tomb-stones around my path
868,GEROID LATOUR,Have been crisply visited by names
869,GEROID LATOUR,To which they bear no relation.
870,GEROID LATOUR,Imagine the perturbation
871,GEROID LATOUR,Of a stone removed
872,GEROID LATOUR,From the comprehension of a mountain
873,GEROID LATOUR,And branded with the name of A. Rozinsky!
874,GEROID LATOUR,"Recollecting journeys of my own,"
875,GEROID LATOUR,I close my eyes and leave the stone.
876,GEROID LATOUR,The names of other men entreat--
877,GEROID LATOUR,Slight variations in line
878,GEROID LATOUR,Ponderously refusing to resign.
879,GEROID LATOUR,Men who will be forgotten
880,GEROID LATOUR,Try to hinder the process with stone.
881,GEROID LATOUR,Because they dread the affirmation
882,GEROID LATOUR,"Of ashes undiscovered in wind,"
883,GEROID LATOUR,I am walking through this cemetery.
884,GEROID LATOUR,
885,GEROID LATOUR,The old grave-diggers will soon
886,GEROID LATOUR,Astonish the earth below this oak.
887,GEROID LATOUR,"From their faces adjectives have fled,"
888,GEROID LATOUR,Leaving the essential noun:
889,GEROID LATOUR,Leaving also the unwilling frown
890,GEROID LATOUR,With which they parley with the earth ...
891,GEROID LATOUR,"Death, I must tell you of these things"
892,GEROID LATOUR,Since you are unaware that they exist.
893,GEROID LATOUR,You send an efficient servant
894,GEROID LATOUR,To the almost unseen fluctuations
895,GEROID LATOUR,"Of tomb-stones, skulls, and lilies,"
896,GEROID LATOUR,Reserving your eyes for larger games.

923,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,"Taking his limbs, like waves."

935,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,The voices made promises

937,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,And often the voices in vengeance
938,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Changed a lip or an eye-brow
939,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,To repeat their neglected demands.
940,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,When swung to him the voices

942,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Tripping him as he stood
943,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Midway between fright and indifference.

945,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,At the obvious absurdity of this.
946,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,His rages were false and sprang

949,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Merely opened a door

968,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,At sixteen he employed words
969,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,To flay the contrast into shapes.
970,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,At seventeen he decided
971,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,To emulate the gay wisdom of children’s flesh.
972,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,He deliberately borrowed whiskey

974,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Lest they intrude their sterility
975,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Upon his plotting exuberance.

983,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,Moderation seemed to him

986,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,"At twenty-four his flesh became tired,"
987,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,And to amuse the weariness
988,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,His hands wrote poetry.
989,SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF A POET’S LIFE,"He had done this before,"

1081,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Makes me as boisterous
1082,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,As a savage attending
1083,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,A minstrel-show of regrets.
1084,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,The pampered carefulness
1085,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,With which you distil a series
1086,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Of standardized perfumes from life
1087,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Takes its promenade
1088,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Between the realms of sanity and madness.
1089,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,You are too precise to be quite sane
1090,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,"And too evasive to be insane,"
1091,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,And all that you have left me
1092,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Is a mood of windy sadness--
1093,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Emotions becoming verbose
1094,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,In a last thin effort
1095,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,To persuade themselves that they loved
1096,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,A jewel that slipped from your fingers.
1097,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Your mind is a limpid warehouse
1098,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,"Filled with other mens’ creations,"
1099,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,"And you pilfer a bit from each,"
1100,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Disguising the scheme of your culture.
1101,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,I would rather be a naked fool
1102,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Than a full-gowned erudite
1103,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,Imitation of other mens’ hands.
1104,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,I shall marry a desperado
1105,UNLITERARY AND SHAMELESS,And give him strength with which to paint

1115,I,I
1116,I,
1117,I,Because her voice is Schönberg in a dream
1118,I,In which his harshness plays with softer keys
1119,I,This does not mean that it is void of ease
1120,I,And cannot gather to a strolling gleam.
1121,I,Her voice is full of manners and they seem
1122,I,To place a masquerade on thought and tease
1123,I,"Its strength until it finds that it has knees,"
1124,I,And whimsically leaves its heavy scheme.
1125,I,
1126,I,Discords can be the search of harmony
1127,I,For worlds that lie beyond the reach of poise
1128,I,And must be captured with abandoned hands.
1129,I,The music of my wife strives to be free
1130,I,"And often takes a light, unbalanced voice"
1131,I,While madly walking over thoughtful lands.
1132,I,
1133,I,
1134,II,II
1135,II,
1136,II,My wife relents to life and does not speak
1137,II,Each moment with a deft and rapid note.
1138,II,Sometimes a clumsy weirdness finds in her throat
1139,II,And ushers in a music that is weak
1140,II,And bargains with the groping of her heart.
1141,II,But even then she plays with graver tones
1142,II,That do not sell themselves to laughs and moans
1143,II,But seek the counsel of a deeper art.
1144,II,
1145,II,She drapes her loud emotions in a shroud
1146,II,Of glistening thought that waves above their dance
1147,II,And sometimes parts to show their startled eyes.
1148,II,The depths of mind within her have not bowed
1149,II,To sleek emotion with its amorous glance.
1150,II,She slaps its face and laughs at its surprise!

1160,I,"Pretend that night is grandiose,"
1161,I,That stars win graves in every ditch;
1162,I,Pretend that moonlight is verbose
1163,I,"And affable, like some grande-mère,"
1164,I,And men will say that your despair
1165,I,"Seduces luminous conceits,"
1166,I,Or call you an anaemic fool
1167,I,Who stuffs himself with curdled sweets.
1168,I,"Thus sentenced to obscurity,"
1169,I,You can find more turbulent lips
1170,I,And spaciously retreat from men
1171,I,Immersed in pedestals and whips.
1172,I,"Amusedly, you can say that stars"
1173,I,Are wizened jests on every ditch;
1174,I,That moonlight is a trick that jars
1175,I,Your mind intent on other minds.
1176,I,"Having agreed upon your station,"
1177,I,"Men will no longer heed your words,"
1178,I,And with a galloping elation
1179,I,You can contradict yourself in peace.

1184,II,The wary perturbations of convinced

1186,II,And deftly tepid to the ears of one
1187,II,"Who entertains a careless, ungloved child."
1188,II,Above the sprightly idleness of plates
1189,II,"Men sit and feign industrious respect,"
1190,II,With eye-brows often slightly ill at ease--
1191,II,Cats in an argument are more erect.
1192,II,At last the tactful lustres of farewells
1193,II,Are traded: each man strolls off and forgets
1194,II,The other--not a frill is disarranged.
1195,II,The tension dexterously avoids regrets.
1196,II,Two men have unveiled carved finalities
1197,II,"And made apologies for the event,"
1198,II,With voices well-acquainted with a task
1199,II,Devoid of nakedness and ornament.
1200,II,"And each man might have murmured, “Yes, I know"
1201,II,"What you will say and what I shall reply,”"
1202,II,And each man might have watched the other man
1203,II,Smile helplessly into his mutton-pie.

1208,III,This farcical clock is copying
1209,III,"A wood-chopper with nimble poise,"
1210,III,"While Time, with still and fluid strides,"
1211,III,Perplexedly listens to the noise.
1212,III,The room that holds this joke is filled
1213,III,With the relaxed complacencies
1214,III,Of poets hiding from themselves
1215,III,With measured trivialities.
1216,III,But one among them walks about
1217,III,And watches with embarrassed eyes.
1218,III,The others do not speak to him:
1219,III,His nudeness is a tight disguise.
1220,III,This fool is anxious to display
1221,III,Interrogations of his mind
1222,III,To poets who at work and play
1223,III,Are isolated from their kind.
1224,III,"Reluctantly he finds his room,"
1225,III,"Sits on the floor, with legs tucked in,"
1226,III,And grins up at another clock
1227,III,Aloofly measuring its din.

1234,IV,A shop-girl coughing over her cigarette
1235,IV,Expresses the burlesque of your distress.
1236,IV,"Take your cocaine. It leaves a blistering stain,"
1237,IV,But phantom diamonds are immune from greed.
1238,IV,"You pluck them from the buttons of your vest,"
1239,IV,Wildly apologising for your need.
1240,IV,Take more. Redress the thinness of your neck
1241,IV,With diamonds; entertain them with your breast;
1242,IV,Cajole them on the floor with fingertips
1243,IV,"That cannot pause, dipped in a demon’s zest."
1244,IV,If you had not relented to a man
1245,IV,"Who meddled with your face and stole your clothes,"
1246,IV,Your shrill creative pleasures might be still
1247,IV,Incarcerated in the usual pose.
1248,IV,Hysteria shot its fist against your face
1249,IV,"One day, and left the blood-spot of your mouth,"
1250,IV,But when the morning strikes you there will be
1251,IV,More than hysteria in your answering shout.
1252,IV,
1253,IV,
1254,V,V
1255,V,
1256,V,Laughter is a skeleton’s applause:
1257,V,Grief sells increase to sterility:
1258,V,Happiness protects its subtle flaws.
1259,V,These three significances make
1260,V,"The part of you that men can see,"
1261,V,"As you recline upon this bed,"
1262,V,"Your hand defending one bare knee,"
1263,V,Your shoulders trapped upon the quilt.
1264,V,But under the warm sophistry
1265,V,"That turns your flesh, another form"
1266,V,Abstractly bellicose and free
1267,V,Attacks the answer of your blood.
1268,V,Freedom is the lowest note
1269,V,"Of slavery, and slavery"
1270,V,The lowest freedom--you can feel
1271,V,The charm of your servility.
1272,V,"True, you were once a chamber-maid"
1273,V,"Who won a thief and spoke to grief,"
1274,V,And now your limbs have numbly strayed.
1275,V,Are these not harmless travesties?

1280,VI,Snobs have pockets into which
1281,VI,They crowd too many trinkets.
1282,VI,"You feel this, talking to the rich"
1283,VI,And lightly bulging mountebank.
1284,VI,Untie the knots that close your bag
1285,VI,And tempt him with a creed or need.
1286,VI,Be as loquacious as a hag
1287,VI,Who loves the details of her wares.
1288,VI,There is a relish when you speak
1289,VI,To one who cannot understand:
1290,VI,You celebrate upon a peak
1291,VI,And prod his helpless effigy.
1292,VI,This is an unimportant game
1293,VI,"To men evading holidays,"
1294,VI,But introspection becomes tame
1295,VI,Unless it compliments itself.
1296,VI,The lightly bulging mountebank
1297,VI,Is but an interval in which
1298,VI,You take your garments off and thank
1299,VI,The privacy that he bestows.
1300,VI,
1301,VI,
1302,VII,VII
1303,VII,
1304,VII,Like other men you fly from adjectives.
1305,VII,The plain terseness that lives in verbs and nouns
1306,VII,Creates a panorama where you know
1307,VII,That men are not a cloud of romping clowns.
1308,VII,You greet the wideness of eternal curves
1309,VII,"Where beauty, death and silence give their height"
1310,VII,To those rare men who do not play with thought.
1311,VII,But this fruit-peddler decorates his fright
1312,VII,And polishes his peaches and his grapes
1313,VII,Insanely. If his mercenary hopes
1314,VII,Were bolder he would be a nimble poet.
1315,VII,"Slight in her bridal gown, his mind elopes"
1316,VII,With adjectives that find her incomplete:
1317,VII,Your mind is hard and massively parades
1318,VII,Across the earth with Homer and Villon.
1319,VII,Since each of you with common sense evades
1320,VII,"Monotony, I join you and refuse"
1321,VII,To call you dwarf or giant. Let the fools
1322,VII,Who criticise you bind you with these names
1323,VII,And separate your dead bones with their rules!

1325,VII,
1326,VIII,VIII
1327,VIII,
1328,VIII,Dead men sit down beside the telephones
1329,VIII,Within your brain and carefully relate
1330,VIII,"Decisions and discretions of the past,"
1331,VIII,Convinced that they will not deteriorate.
1332,VIII,But you have not their certainty: you try
1333,VIII,A question now and then that cautiously
1334,VIII,Assaults their whispered indolence until
1335,VIII,Their sharp words once more force you to agree.
1336,VIII,Then you insist that certain living men
1337,VIII,Whose tones are half-discreet may be allowed
1338,VIII,"To greet their masters through the telephones,"
1339,VIII,Provided that their words are not too loud.
1340,VIII,The new men imperceptibly entice
1341,VIII,"Their elders, and a compromise is made,"
1342,VIII,Both sides discovering that two or three
1343,VIII,Excluded men must be correctly flayed.
1344,VIII,And so the matter ends; conservative
1345,VIII,"And radical revise their family-tree,"
1346,VIII,While you report this happening with relief
1347,VIII,To liberals and victorious cups of tea.

1951,INSANITY,he walked. “They quarrel with bits of orange peel and pins. Patiently
1952,INSANITY,they wait for the red rain that men give them every two hundred years.
1953,INSANITY,Brown and red always sweep toward each other. Men are often unknowingly
1954,INSANITY,killed by these two huge colours treading the insects upon a path and
1955,INSANITY,walking to an ultimate trysting-place.”
1956,INSANITY,
1957,INSANITY,The little girl whose face was like a molasses crescent cut off one of
1958,INSANITY,her yellow curls and hung it from her closed mouth.
1959,INSANITY,
1960,INSANITY,“Why are you acting in this way?” asked Geroid.
1961,INSANITY,
1962,INSANITY,"“It’s something I’ve never done before,” she answered placidly."
1963,INSANITY,
1964,INSANITY,Geroid stroked his raspberry beard with menacing longing but could not
1965,INSANITY,quite induce himself to pull it off. It would have been like cutting
1966,INSANITY,the throat of his mistress.
1967,INSANITY,
1968,INSANITY,"They passed an insincerely littered courtyard, tame beneath its gray"
1969,INSANITY,"tatters, and saw a black cat chasing a yellow cat."
1970,INSANITY,
1971,INSANITY,“A cat never eats a cat--goldfish and dead lions are more to his
1972,INSANITY,"taste,” said Geroid. “Indulgently he flees from other cats or pursues"
1973,INSANITY,them in turn.”
1974,INSANITY,
1975,INSANITY,"“I see that you dislike melodrama,” observed a bulbous woman in"
1976,INSANITY,"penitent lavender, who was beating a carpet in the courtyard."
1977,INSANITY,
1978,INSANITY,“You’re mistaken. Melodrama is a weirdly drunken plausibility and can
1979,INSANITY,"not sincerely be disliked,” said Geroid. “But I must not leave without"
1980,INSANITY,complimenting your lavender wrapper. Few people have mastered the art
1981,INSANITY,of being profoundly ridiculous.”
1982,INSANITY,
1983,INSANITY,"“I can see that you’re trying to be ridiculously profound,” said the"
1984,INSANITY,woman as she threw a bucket of stale water at Geroid. He fled down the
1985,INSANITY,"street, dragging the child with him. They left the cumbersome sterility"
1986,INSANITY,of the city behind them and passed into the suburbs.
1987,INSANITY,
1988,INSANITY,"“Here we have a tragedy in shades of naked inertness,” said Geroid to"
1989,INSANITY,the little girl.
1990,INSANITY,
1991,INSANITY,"“I don’t quite understand you,” answered the little girl. “I see"
1992,INSANITY,nothing but scowls and brownness.”
1993,INSANITY,
1994,INSANITY,A tree stood out like the black veins on an unseen fist. A square
1995,INSANITY,house raised its toothless snarl and all the other houses were jealous
1996,INSANITY,"imitators. Wooden fences crossed each other with dejected, mathematical"
1997,INSANITY,precision. A rat underneath a veranda scuffled with an empty candy box.
1998,INSANITY,The green of dried grasses spread out like poisonous impotence.
1999,INSANITY,
2000,INSANITY,"“Here is the house where my mother lies dead,” said the little girl."
2001,INSANITY,
2002,INSANITY,Her father--peace germinating into greasy overalls--came down the
2003,INSANITY,steps. His blue eyes were parodies on the sky--discs of sinisterly
2004,INSANITY,humourous blue; his face reminded one of a pear that had been stepped
2005,INSANITY,on--resiliently flattened.
2006,INSANITY,
2007,INSANITY,"“I have come to measure your wife for her coffin,” said Geroid Latour."
2008,INSANITY,
2009,INSANITY,"“You’ll find her at the bottom of the well in the back-yard,” answered"
2010,INSANITY,the man.
2011,INSANITY,
2012,INSANITY,“Trying to cheat a poor old undertaker out of his business!” said
2013,INSANITY,"Latour, waggishly."
2014,INSANITY,
2015,INSANITY,"“No, I’ll leave that to death,” said the man. “Come inside and warm"
2016,INSANITY,your candour.”
2017,INSANITY,
2018,INSANITY,"“No, thank you, shrieks travel faster through the open air,” said"
2019,INSANITY,"Geroid, squinting at the man’s sportively cerulean eyes."
2020,INSANITY,
2021,INSANITY,"“Come out to the well and we’ll haul her up,” said the man."
2022,INSANITY,
2023,INSANITY,"The little girl darted into the house, like a disappointed hobgoblin,"
2024,INSANITY,and Geroid Latour followed the man to the well at the rear of the
2025,INSANITY,house. Suddenly he saw a mountainous washerwoman dancing on her toes
2026,INSANITY,over the black loam. Her sparse grayish black hair flapped behind her
2027,INSANITY,like a dishrag and her naked body had the color of trampled snow. An
2028,INSANITY,empty beer-bottle was balanced on her head. She had the face of an old
2029,INSANITY,Columbine who still thought herself beautiful.
2030,INSANITY,
2031,INSANITY,"“A neighbour of mine,” said the man in an awed voice. “She was a"
2032,INSANITY,ballet-dancer in her youth and every midnight she makes my back-yard a
2033,INSANITY,"theater. In the morning she scrubs my floors. Here, in my back-yard,"
2034,INSANITY,she chases the phantoms of her former triumphs. Moonlight turns her
2035,INSANITY,knee joints into miracles!”
2036,INSANITY,
2037,INSANITY,"“Ah, from enormous wildness and pretence, squeezed together, comes the"
2038,INSANITY,"little drop of happiness,” said Geroid Latour, sentimentally."
2039,INSANITY,
2040,INSANITY,"“My wife objected to my joining this woman’s midnight dance,” said the"
2041,INSANITY,"man. “To prevent her from informing the police, I killed her. I could"
2042,INSANITY,not see a miracle ruined.”
2043,INSANITY,
2044,INSANITY,"“Only the insane are entertaining,” answered Geroid. “The egoism of"
2045,INSANITY,sane people is gruesome--a modulated scale of complacent gaieties--but
2046,INSANITY,insane people often display an artificial ego which is divine. The
2047,INSANITY,"artist, gracefully gesticulating about himself, on his divan, is"
2048,INSANITY,"hideous, but if he danced on a boulder and waved a lilac bough in one"
2049,INSANITY,"hand and a broom in the other, one could respect him.”"
2050,INSANITY,
2051,INSANITY,As Geroid finished talking the mountainous washerwoman drew nearer and
2052,INSANITY,stopped in front of the man. Blossoming glints of water dropped from
2053,INSANITY,her grayish white skin.
2054,INSANITY,
2055,INSANITY,"“You haven’t killed me yet, my dear husband,” she shouted to the man."
2056,INSANITY,"Then, snatching the beer-bottle balanced on her head she struck at him."
2057,INSANITY,"Geroid fled to the front gate and sped down the road. Looking back,"
2058,INSANITY,"from a safe distance, he saw the mountainous woman, the man, and the"
2059,INSANITY,little child earnestly gesticulating in the moonlight.

2066,POETRY,
2067,POETRY,Morning light anxiously pinched the cheeks of these poplar trees. The
2068,POETRY,silver blood rushed to their faces and they blushed. The garden walls
2069,POETRY,"forgot their stolidity for a moment and seemed inclined to leap away,"
2070,POETRY,"but became sober again, resisting the twinkling trickery of morning"
2071,POETRY,"light. Airily suspended tales in light and colour, of no importance to"
2072,POETRY,"philosophers, hung over the scene. Only a snail underneath the trees,"
2073,POETRY,"steeped in a creeping evening, lived apart from the crisp medley of"
2074,POETRY,"morning lights. Laboriously, the snail moved through his explanation of"
2075,POETRY,"the universe. But, to blades of grass, their lives tersely centered in"
2076,POETRY,"green, the morning was a mysterious pressure."
2077,POETRY,
2078,POETRY,The morning glowed over the garden like an incoherent rhapsody. It
2079,POETRY,"lacked order and thought, and the serious eyes of teachers and jesters"
2080,POETRY,"would have spurned it. But Halfert Bolin, walking between rows of cold"
2081,POETRY,"peonies, regarded the morning with harsh approval and spoke."
2082,POETRY,
2083,POETRY,“You have the brightness and flatness of a distracted virgin but your
2084,POETRY,eyes are mildly opaque. The tinseled swiftness of a courtesan’s memoirs
2085,POETRY,is yours but your heart is as shy as the clink of glass. You glow like
2086,POETRY,an incoherent rhapsody over the peonies in this garden!”
2087,POETRY,
2088,POETRY,A woman whose painted face was a lurid snarl tapped Bolin on the
2089,POETRY,shoulder. Her red hair was brushed upward into a pinnacle of burnished
2090,POETRY,frenzy; her blue serge dress cast its plaintive monotone over the body
2091,POETRY,of a sagging amazon; a pink straw hat dangled from her hand. Bolin
2092,POETRY,allowed his admiration to bow.
2093,POETRY,
2094,POETRY,"“A babyish lisp slipping from you would make your grewsomeness perfect,"
2095,POETRY,"madame,” he said."
2096,POETRY,
2097,POETRY,"“I don’t getcha, friend,” she responded. “I’m a sporting lady from the"
2098,POETRY,roadhouse down the way an’ I’m out for a morning walk. Who planted you
2099,POETRY,"here, old duck?”"
2100,POETRY,
2101,POETRY,"“I’m a cow browsing amidst the peonies,” said Bolin seriously. “Without"
2102,POETRY,"a thought, I feed on light and colour.”"
2103,POETRY,
2104,POETRY,"“You don’t look like a cow,” said the woman, dubiously. “Maybe you’re"
2105,POETRY,"spoofing me, you funny old turnip!”"
2106,POETRY,
2107,POETRY,"“No, I only jest with the morning,” Bolin answered, unperturbed."
2108,POETRY,“It ignores me with soaring colours and I prefer this to the minute
2109,POETRY,antagonisms of human beings. You don’t understand a word I say--you
2110,POETRY,"bend beneath tepid apprehension, so I find a pleasure in speaking to"
2111,POETRY,you--it’s like humming a love-song to a mud-turtle.”
2112,POETRY,
2113,POETRY,"“Don’t get insultin’,” said the woman with disgruntled amazement. “I"
2114,POETRY,think you’re crazy.”
2115,POETRY,
2116,POETRY,"Bolin turned, with a smile like a distant spark, and walked away"
2117,POETRY,"between the peonies. The woman regarded him a moment, while a"
2118,POETRY,fascinated frown battled with her painted face. Then she strode after
2119,POETRY,him and gripped his arm.
2120,POETRY,
2121,POETRY,"“Hey, watcha leavin’ me for?” she said in a piteously strident voice."
2122,POETRY,
2123,POETRY,"“For the peonies in this garden,” answered Bolin, mildly."
2124,POETRY,
2125,POETRY,"“Listen, don’t get mad at me,” she said. “I don’t care whether you’re"
2126,POETRY,crazy or not. I like your face.”
2127,POETRY,
2128,POETRY,Bolin gazed at her while sorrow loosened his face and made it glisten
2129,POETRY,spaciously.
2130,POETRY,
2131,POETRY,“Can you become as spontaneously tranquil as these peonies?” he asked.
2132,POETRY,
2133,POETRY,"The woman tendered him her dazed frown, like an anxious servant."
2134,POETRY,
2135,POETRY,"“Walk with me and be quiet unless I ask you to speak,” said Bolin with"
2136,POETRY,sudden harshness.
2137,POETRY,
2138,POETRY,Obediently she laid a hand on his arm and they strolled down the path
2139,POETRY,between the peonies. She sidled along like an inspired puppet--she
2140,POETRY,seemed a doll touched to life by some Christ. Upon her painted face a
2141,POETRY,nun and a violinist grappled tentatively and her lips made a red scarf
2142,POETRY,fallen from the struggle. Bolin left the peonies and wandered down the
2143,POETRY,road. They came upon a boulder clad in an outline of smashed spears.
2144,POETRY,"Queen Anne’s Lace grew close to its base, like the remnants of some"
2145,POETRY,revel.
2146,POETRY,
2147,POETRY,"“This is the head of a philosopher,” said Bolin."
2148,POETRY,
2149,POETRY,"The woman jerkily turned her body, while pallid perplexity ate into her"
2150,POETRY,paint and made her face narrow.
2151,POETRY,
2152,POETRY,"“You can speak,” said Bolin."
2153,POETRY,
2154,POETRY,"“It looks like a rock,” she answered in the voice of a child clinking"
2155,POETRY,his fetters.
2156,POETRY,
2157,POETRY,"“We have both spoken words,” said Bolin mildly."
2158,POETRY,
2159,POETRY,"The shy blindness on her face glided to and fro, like a prisoner. As"
2160,POETRY,she strolled with Bolin she still seemed a puppet dragged along the
2161,POETRY,"dust of a road by some Christ. Bolin’s middle-aged face whistled, with"
2162,POETRY,"limpid chagrin, to his youth. His high cheek-bones were like hidden"
2163,POETRY,fists straining against his sallow skin.
2164,POETRY,
2165,POETRY,They came upon a dead rabbit stiffening by the roadside.
2166,POETRY,
2167,POETRY,"“Bury him,” said Bolin, gravely."
2168,POETRY,
2169,POETRY,The woman clutched at her habitual self.
2170,POETRY,
2171,POETRY,"“S-a-a-y, what’s the idea?” she asked in a shrilly lengthened voice."
2172,POETRY,
2173,POETRY,"“Bury him,” repeated Bolin gravely."
2174,POETRY,
2175,POETRY,With a dazed giggle she picked a dead branch from the ground and jabbed
2176,POETRY,at the loose black loam. Then she gingerly prodded the dead rabbit with
2177,POETRY,"the branch, shoving it into the depression she had made. She scooped"
2178,POETRY,earth over it with her foot.
2179,POETRY,
2180,POETRY,"“Now we’re both crazy,” she said uncertainly, and her nervous smile was"
2181,POETRY,the juggled wreck of a silver helmet.
2182,POETRY,
2183,POETRY,"“You have buried your meekness,” said Bolin, calmly amused. “Now walk"
2184,POETRY,"beside me and do not speak unless, being brave, you desire to leave me.”"
2185,POETRY,
2186,POETRY,"The woman stood gaping at him, like a vision poignantly doubting"
2187,POETRY,the magician who has created it. Sullenness made her lips straight
2188,POETRY,"for a moment, then faded into twitching awe. She slid her arm into"
2189,POETRY,his and once more seemed a doll dragged along the dust of a road by
2190,POETRY,some distracted giant. Bolin retraced his steps; he and the woman
2191,POETRY,passed by the garden of cold peonies and came to a bend in the road.
2192,POETRY,Late afternoon blundered sedately through shades of green foliage
2193,POETRY,"beneath them. Below the hilltop on which they stood, a barn-like house"
2194,POETRY,"crouched, its tan cerements repelling the afternoon light."
2195,POETRY,
2196,POETRY,The woman tapped her chin with two fingers in a drum-beat of reality.
2197,POETRY,
2198,POETRY,"“Gotta get back to work, old dear,” she said, amiably squinting at"
2199,POETRY,Bolin.
2200,POETRY,
2201,POETRY,Bolin’s sallow face shook once and became chiseled apathy.
2202,POETRY,
2203,POETRY,"“So do I,” he answered, his voice like the accidental ring of light"
2204,POETRY,metals. “I’m the new waiter Foley hired last week. You’ve been too busy
2205,POETRY,to notice me much.”
2206,POETRY,
2207,POETRY,"For a full minute the woman stood staring at him, her hands upon her"
2208,POETRY,"hips, her slightly bulging gray eyes like water-drops threatening to"
2209,POETRY,roll down her shattered face.
2210,POETRY,
2211,POETRY,"“You’re the guy they call Nutty Louie,” she said at last, as though"
2212,POETRY,confiding a ludicrously startling message to herself.
2213,POETRY,
2214,POETRY,Then for another full minute she stood staring at him.
2215,POETRY,
2216,POETRY,"“We’re bughouse,” she said in a mesmerised whisper. “Bughouse.”"
2217,POETRY,
2218,POETRY,Bolin walked forward without a word. The woman gaped at him for a
2219,POETRY,moment and then ran after him as she had in the garden of peonies.

2227,RELIGION,Alvin Tor sat in his floating row-boat and read the Bible. Green waves
2228,RELIGION,"died upon each other, like a cohesive fantasy. Each small wave rose as"
2229,RELIGION,high as the other and ended in a swan’s neck of white interrogation.
2230,RELIGION,Sunlight blinded the water as style dazes the contents of a poem and
2231,RELIGION,the blue sky lifted itself to symmetrical stupor. The air fell against
2232,RELIGION,one like a soothing religion. The bristling melancholia of pine trees
2233,RELIGION,"lined the wide river. But Alvin Tor sat in his floating row-boat,"
2234,RELIGION,"reading the Bible. He read the Songs of Solomon, and a sensual"
2235,RELIGION,pantomime made a taut stage of his face. When not reading the Songs
2236,RELIGION,of Solomon he was as staidly poised as a monk’s folded arms. He had
2237,RELIGION,borrowed the colours of his life from that spectrum of desire which he
2238,RELIGION,"called God. Different shades of green leaves were, to him, the playful"
2239,RELIGION,jealousies of a presence; the tossed colours of birds became the
2240,RELIGION,ineffably light gestures of a lost poet.
2241,RELIGION,
2242,RELIGION,His Swedish peasant’s face had singed its dimples in a bit of
2243,RELIGION,sophistication but his eyes were undeceived. His heart was a secluded
2244,RELIGION,soliloquy transforming the shouts of the world into tinkling surmises.
2245,RELIGION,His broad nose and long lips were always at ease and his ruddy skin
2246,RELIGION,held the texture of fresh bunting. His eyes knew the unkindled
2247,RELIGION,reticence of a rustic boy.
2248,RELIGION,
2249,RELIGION,"This man of one mood sat in his floating row-boat, reading the Bible."
2250,RELIGION,He reached the mouth of the river and drifted out to sea. The sea was
2251,RELIGION,a menacing lethargy of rhythm: green swells sensed his row-boat with
2252,RELIGION,"dramatic leisure. A sea gull skimmed over the water, like a haphazard"
2253,RELIGION,adventure. Looking up from his Bible Alvin Tor saw the body of a
2254,RELIGION,woman floating beside his boat. With one jerk his face swerved into
2255,RELIGION,blankness. The tip of his tongue met his upper lip as though it were
2256,RELIGION,a fading rim of reality. The fingers of one hand distressed his flaxen
2257,RELIGION,hair.
2258,RELIGION,
2259,RELIGION,The woman floated on her back with infinite abandon. Little ripples of
2260,RELIGION,green water died fondling her body. The green swells barely lifting her
2261,RELIGION,"were great rhythms disturbed by an inert discord. Sunlight, fumbling at"
2262,RELIGION,"her body, relinquished its promiscuous desires and became abashed. _Her"
2263,RELIGION,wet brown hair had a drugged gentility: its short dark curls hugged
2264,RELIGION,her head with despondent understanding. Her face had been washed to
2265,RELIGION,an imperturbable transparency: it had the whiteness of reclining foam
2266,RELIGION,overcast with a twinge of green--the sea had lent her its skin._ Her
2267,RELIGION,eyes were limply unworried and violated to gray disintegration. In
2268,RELIGION,separated bits of outlines the remains of thinly impudent features were
2269,RELIGION,slipping from her face. The bloated pity of black and white garments
2270,RELIGION,hid her lean body.
2271,RELIGION,
2272,RELIGION,"As Alvin Tor watched her, tendrils of peace gradually interfered with"
2273,RELIGION,the blankness on his face. His lips sustained an unpremeditated repose.
2274,RELIGION,A sensitive compassion dropped the sparks of its coming into his eyes.
2275,RELIGION,His clothes became a jest upon an inhuman body; the earth of him
2276,RELIGION,effortlessly transcended itself in the gesture of his arm flung out to
2277,RELIGION,the woman.
2278,RELIGION,
2279,RELIGION,"“Impalpable relic of a soul, the spirit you held must have severed"
2280,RELIGION,"its shadow to preserve you forever from the waves,” he said, his face"
2281,RELIGION,"blindfolded with ecstasy, “for you grasp the water with immortal"
2282,RELIGION,relaxation. You are not a body--you are beauty receding into a
2283,RELIGION,resistless seclusion.”
2284,RELIGION,
2285,RELIGION,"“Kind fool, musically stifling himself in a row-boat--made kind by the"
2286,RELIGION,desperate tenderness of a lie--you are serenading the chopped bodies of
2287,RELIGION,"your emotions,” said the woman."
2288,RELIGION,
2289,RELIGION,Alvin Tor’s face cracked apart and the incredulously hurrying ghost of
2290,RELIGION,a child nodded a moment and was snuffed out.
2291,RELIGION,
2292,RELIGION,"“Mermaid of haunting despondency, what are you?” he asked."
2293,RELIGION,
2294,RELIGION,"“I am the symbol of your emotions,” the woman answered."
2295,RELIGION,
2296,RELIGION,"“I made them roses stepped upon by God,” said Alvin Tor."
2297,RELIGION,
2298,RELIGION,"“I am the symbol of your emotions,” said the woman."
2299,RELIGION,
2300,RELIGION,"Alvin Tor heavily dropped his raised arm, like a man smashing a"
2301,RELIGION,trumpet. Restless white hands compressed the ruddy broadness of his
2302,RELIGION,face. The woman slid into the green swells like exhausted magic. Alvin
2303,RELIGION,Tor rowed back to the river.

2330,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"parabola between gray rocks, flying into a stifled scream of motion far"
2331,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"below. When the pine trees moved a mathematician solved his problems,"
2332,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,and his acrid exultation hypnotized the air. The pungent truculence of
2333,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,earth that had never been stepped on raised its brown shades.
2334,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,
2335,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,Eric Lane stopped in an alcove of pine trees; lifted a pack from his
2336,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,back; pitched his tent; and broke dead pine branches across his knee.
2337,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,There were scars on his face where philosophies had broken and died
2338,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,and the beaming redundancy of one that survived. For Eric believed
2339,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"that the visible and audible surface of man’s conduct and dreams,"
2340,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"when interpreted and compared, could reveal his frustrated hungers."
2341,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"Metaphysics, to him, was a beggar rattling his chains into insincere"
2342,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,victories of sound--a beggar painting seraphs upon the strained
2343,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,finality of his brain.
2344,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,
2345,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,Eric looked up from his task of breaking dead pine branches. A first
2346,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"shade of twilight climbed the mountain, like a dazed negro runner. The"
2347,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,mountain impassively confessed that its vehemence had been a lie. It
2348,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,met the sky with an immense line of collapsed reticence. The waterfall
2349,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,became the squirming of a white hermit who finds a black stranger
2350,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,invading his cell. Twilight was a body gradually returning to the
2351,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,festooned skeletons of the pine trees. The rocks were enticed into
2352,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,attitudes--one was a giant fondling the spear that had wounded him;
2353,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,another curved over like a gray serf who had broken his back. Eric
2354,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,stared at a huge rock standing on the mountainside and outlined against
2355,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,the distant base of a second mountain. It held the tensely embalmed
2356,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,profile of a woman. Her rigidly woebegone features had withdrawn
2357,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,from some devil’s cliff of desire; they made a line of incomplete
2358,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,crucifixion. Her hidden eyes germinated into ghouls stealthily
2359,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,absorbing the gray harvest of her face. Designed by a shattered surmise
2360,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,her face retreated from the valley. Her forehead was like a sword
2361,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,cracked in the middle; her nose and lips were the remains of an autopsy
2362,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,on emotion. Demons and virgins had gained one grave in the grayness
2363,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,assailing her face.
2364,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,
2365,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,Eric regarded her at first with a celebrating scepticism; then
2366,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,sallowness slowly marked his face into a hanging scroll of terror.
2367,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,Lightness vanished from his black hair and it became a charred crown.
2368,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"He tottered three steps in the direction of the rock-face and then,"
2369,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"with unannounced dexterity, a smile revived his face. The diminutive"
2370,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,city of his mind had sent its lord-mayor to restore him. Eric returned
2371,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,to his task of breaking dead pine branches. The diminutive city of
2372,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,his mind sent slender pæans into electric threads. Eric kindled the
2373,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"branches into a fire, and a carnival of flames pirouetted into startled"
2374,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"death. Eric stretched his arms out, like a concubine stroking the walls"
2375,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"of her black tent, and his face became idly immobile. Then he altered"
2376,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"completely, in the leap of a moment, as though slipping from a loose"
2377,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,costume with infinite ease. His face stiffened into the unearthly
2378,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"equilibrium of thought witnessing the torture of emotion. The fire, to"
2379,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"him, became a gaudy funeral-pyre. When sleep finally interfered with"
2380,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"his face he dropped slowly to the ground, like satiated revenge."
2381,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,
2382,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"When he awoke, morning assaulted the gaunt scene with unceremonious"
2383,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,clarity. The mountain became a senseless giant; the waterfall changed
2384,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,to a commonplace ribbon: and the pine trees blended into the lethargy
2385,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,of dwarfs. The gray rock on the mountain was still gashed into the
2386,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,face of a woman but her outlines were those of a transfigured virago.
2387,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"Eric strapped on his pack; gazed down at the rock, with the smile of"
2388,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"a merchant emerging from drunken memories, and strode toward it. When"
2389,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"he reached it he hammered away a flat fragment, for remembrance, and"
2390,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"returned to the mountain path, with an expressionless face."

2394,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,Eric Lane ended his lecture on scientific philosophy and tapped a
2395,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"desecrating hand, for a moment, on the profile that had told me a story"
2396,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,during his talk. He had left the mountain pass but he was unaware of
2397,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"that. He would have laughed at the idea, like a beggar who rattles his"
2398,SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY,"chains into insincere victories of sound. Of that, too, he was unaware."

2405,ART,
2406,ART,Mrs. Calvin and Mrs. Kildrick stood on opposite sides of a back-yard
2407,ART,fence. Around them the romping improbabilities of early spring were
2408,ART,dispersed amidst the sour reality of suburban houses. Pale green
2409,ART,"surrounded the small, square abodes, like an impish irrelevance. Each"
2410,ART,"house carried a shade of dull green, brown and red, and these shades"
2411,ART,fitted into each other and made a meekly repressed story. Cinder
2412,ART,side-walks stretched in front of the houses--remorsefully dry remains
2413,ART,"of fire, sacrificing themselves to occasional feet. The entire scene"
2414,ART,was an unconscious reflection of the minds of Mrs. Calvin and Mrs.
2415,ART,"Kildrick, standing on opposite sides of a back-yard fence."
2416,ART,
2417,ART,"These women held an unblossoming stoutness, like buds that had swollen"
2418,ART,enormously but failed to open. Their gray muslin wrappers were too
2419,ART,undistinguished to be shrouds and sepulchrally flirted with red
2420,ART,ruffles. Mrs. Calvin had an implacably round face and it reminded one
2421,ART,"of a merchant scolding an infant. Mrs. Kildrick’s face was round, but"
2422,ART,"softer, like that of a frustrated milk-maid."
2423,ART,
2424,ART,"“You ought to see her room,” said Mrs. Kildrick. “It looks like a"
2425,ART,"drunkard’s confession, as my husband says, the funniest clay figgers"
2426,ART,and paintins you ever saw.”
2427,ART,
2428,ART,"“I couldn’t believe it when you told me,” said Mrs. Calvin, “the poor"
2429,ART,dear looks so-o respectable--what can be ailing her?”
2430,ART,
2431,ART,"“She calls it her a-art,” said Mrs. Kildrick. “Well, as my husband does"
2432,ART,"say, we should pity those whose minds are a little bit cracked!”"
2433,ART,
2434,ART,The ladies continued to adulterate the wanness of their doubts and the
2435,ART,sunlight continued its blunt rummaging way among the rubbish-cans and
2436,ART,fences. The afternoon jovially began to change its glowing costume for
2437,ART,"a pretended death scene, studying and lingering over gray effects. Just"
2438,ART,as its melancholy was heaving toward a climax Helma Solbert strode up
2439,ART,the cinder walk leading to Mrs. Kildrick’s abode.
2440,ART,
2441,ART,She was a woman of thirty with a body whose dying youth amply derided
2442,ART,middle-age. Her ovally impertinent face spoke to the first warnings of
2443,ART,dissolution and told them that their coming had been ill-advised. Weary
2444,ART,"but tenaciously merry, her gray eyes were close to those of one who"
2445,ART,has made the dagger in his side a cajoling saint. Her little nose was
2446,ART,a straight invitation to her widely ripe lips and they turned upward
2447,ART,as if to reach it. She wore a blue serge suit that was an incongruous
2448,ART,"commonplace but did not quite succeed in effacing her. Round and black,"
2449,ART,"her small hat rested lightly upon her brown and abundant hair, like an"
2450,ART,"inconspicuous accident. She entered her room, abandoned her hat and"
2451,ART,"coat, and measured herself in a mirror as though encouraging a stranger"
2452,ART,to play with his burden. Then a smile of delighted futility plucked
2453,ART,at her lips and she closed her eyes to avoid robbing the stranger of
2454,ART,his forlornly puzzling charm. With her eyes still closed she walked to
2455,ART,"a couch and stretched out upon it, and everything vanished from her"
2456,ART,face except its flesh. Framed canvases hung upon the yellow plaster
2457,ART,walls of the room and each frame had a shape that obviously failed
2458,ART,to harmonize with the painting it enclosed. Unconscious of the stiff
2459,ART,"challenges holding them, the canvases stood in the fading afternoon"
2460,ART,"light, like a disconnected fable. One above the couch represented a"
2461,ART,small red apple split by an enormous dark green hatchet. The hatchet
2462,ART,had driven one of its points into a wooden table and slanted steeply
2463,ART,"upward, its slender handle rising to an upper corner of the painting."
2464,ART,Two little hemispheres of red and white apple cowered on each side
2465,ART,"of the hatchet’s blade. The visible, level top of the table was dark"
2466,ART,brown and terminated against a feebly violet background. The following
2467,ART,sentimental words were painted in black letters high upon the violet.
2468,ART,
2469,ART,"“The hatchet struck at weak beauty, but--”"
2470,ART,
2471,ART,The canvas was enclosed by a round frame painted in a shade of apple
2472,ART,red. Each canvas in the room held the first line of a poem that was
2473,ART,completed by the colored forms of the painting or a last line preceded
2474,ART,by visual symbols. With the air of a fanatic whose blood had tightened
2475,ART,"into loops of fire that cast their sheen upon his voice, Helma would"
2476,ART,say to rare visitors viewing her paintings:
2477,ART,
2478,ART,"“By blending into one, art, literature and painting can lose their"
2479,ART,deficiencies and gain perfection. I am merely experimenting with the
2480,ART,crude promise of this future union.”
2481,ART,
2482,ART,On a canvas at the opposite side of the room a huge complexly broken
2483,ART,arrow emerged from a pale red sky. The black arrow pieces were dotted
2484,ART,"with tiny yellow, indigo and pink birds. Dark red lips, each twisted to"
2485,ART,"a different expression, stood in the corners of the canvas. Extending"
2486,ART,down the left side of the painting the following line was written in
2487,ART,black against a strip of bare canvas.
2488,ART,
2489,ART,"“Thus I spoke one afternoon, because--”"
2490,ART,
2491,ART,"Helma Solbert rose from her couch, lit a candle and stood before the"
2492,ART,"arrow-framed painting, gazing at it with a pierced and subtly colorless"
2493,ART,"face. Then she turned on an electric light and its artificial stare,"
2494,ART,"in an instant, brought her an obliterating self-consciousness. With"
2495,ART,the bearing of one who impudently walks to a gruesome sacrifice she
2496,ART,disappeared behind a lavender screen in a corner of the room and fried
2497,ART,her evening meal. When she emerged from the screen her face had once
2498,ART,more perfected its defensive impertinence. Even in her sleep some hours
2499,ART,later her features retained the blurred suspicion of a smile that
2500,ART,stayed like a lurking sentinel.
2501,ART,
2502,ART,The following morning she was too ill to rise and Mrs. Kildrick
2503,ART,summoned a doctor. He was a portly man with a steeply florid face and
2504,ART,a dominating beard that had the color of wet sand. While he was in the
2505,ART,midst of examining his patient she rose to a sitting posture and stared
2506,ART,at him.
2507,ART,
2508,ART,“You’re what I tried to hide from; why have you come to plague me?” she
2509,ART,"said, loudly."

2517,MUSIC,Olga Crawford fiercely divorced herself from all expression as she
2518,MUSIC,maltreated her violin at the Symphony Moving Picture Theater. In
2519,MUSIC,its average moments of vivacity her face was a dissembling friar
2520,MUSIC,"who brightly listened to her sensual lips, but as she played, her"
2521,MUSIC,face became an emptiness profaned by the wail of her instrument. Her
2522,MUSIC,arms desecrated their errands and her head sloped into an unwilling
2523,MUSIC,counterfeit of wakefulness. On the screen above her men and women
2524,MUSIC,frantically guarded their hallucination of life and a decrepit
2525,MUSIC,plot vaguely imitated love and bravery. Rows of faces stolidly
2526,MUSIC,"massacred the gloom of the theater and stood like a regiment waiting,"
2527,MUSIC,"without thought, for some command. But when one looked closer three"
2528,MUSIC,"expressions broke from the stolidity, as three major harmonies might"
2529,MUSIC,charm the mind of a composer. The first was a somnolent elation--the
2530,MUSIC,mien of a hungry person dozing over some crumbs he is almost too
2531,MUSIC,"tired to eat. Shop-girls, with pertly robbed faces, became victims"
2532,MUSIC,"of this expression, although an occasional man with lips like"
2533,MUSIC,determined fiascoes also attained it. The second was a tightly laced
2534,MUSIC,impatience--the enmity of one whose feelings have been openly censored.
2535,MUSIC,Fat women with flabbily throttled faces and glistening men with bodies
2536,MUSIC,like bulky scandals received this expression. The third was a seraphic
2537,MUSIC,stupor--the demeanour of one whose formless delights have benignly
2538,MUSIC,exiled thought.
2539,MUSIC,
2540,MUSIC,To Olga these people gathered into a blanched duplicate of life--a
2541,MUSIC,remote comedy that made the monotone of her evening self-conscious.
2542,MUSIC,"If they had excoriated her she could have forgotten them, but their"
2543,MUSIC,weighty indifference raped her attention. The dryly sinuous smell of
2544,MUSIC,"their clothes pelted her like a sandstorm: the little, desperate"
2545,MUSIC,perfumes they used scarcely survived. Their eyes were scores of tinily
2546,MUSIC,inviting bulls-eyes never reached by her hurried arrows.
2547,MUSIC,
2548,MUSIC,She finished her playing; the people shuffled out like an apologetic
2549,MUSIC,"delusion. Ferenz, the pianist, a cowed Toreador of a man, gave his"
2550,MUSIC,browns and blacks a ponderous recreation.
2551,MUSIC,
2552,MUSIC,"“Nother grind passed,” he said in a thick voice corrupted by pity."
2553,MUSIC,"“Hand over them sheets, Joe.”"
2554,MUSIC,
2555,MUSIC,"Joe, fat as a gourmand’s revery, handed him the sheets. The features on"
2556,MUSIC,Joe’s face were as abject as crumbs on a shallow plate. The Symphony
2557,MUSIC,Theater orchestra flaunted its yawning moroseness a little while longer
2558,MUSIC,and filed through a low exit.
2559,MUSIC,
2560,MUSIC,Olga’s feet tamely saluted the crowded street-pavements. To her the
2561,MUSIC,crowd was an approach to the theater audience--a brisk indifference
2562,MUSIC,that made her eyes neglected spendthrifts. Its motion alone gave it
2563,MUSIC,"a flickering mastery: if it had paused, for an hour, it would have"
2564,MUSIC,become inane. The choked tirade of rolling street-cars and automobiles
2565,MUSIC,would have ended in a dismal curtain of silence--the chariots would
2566,MUSIC,"have changed to mere hardware puzzled by the moonlight. A tall woman,"
2567,MUSIC,"encouraging the gorgeous tumult of her dresses, would have stood like"
2568,MUSIC,"a cluttered farce. The little pagan symmetries of her face, gaudily"
2569,MUSIC,"tantalizing when merely glimpsed, would have met in a kittenish"
2570,MUSIC,"argument. A tall man, blondly governing his polished discrepancies,"
2571,MUSIC,"would have changed to a stagnant buffoon. An old man, chiding his"
2572,MUSIC,"corpulent effulgence with endearments of motion, would have altered to"
2573,MUSIC,a maudlin exaggeration.
2574,MUSIC,
2575,MUSIC,Olga reached her room and summoned the meaningless stare of an electric
2576,MUSIC,light. Upon her short body plumpness and slenderness bargained with
2577,MUSIC,"each other, and the result was a suave arbitration. Her dark green"
2578,MUSIC,skirt and white waist made a subdued affirmation: their coloured lines
2579,MUSIC,did not emphasise the lurking essences of her body. Surrounded by black
2580,MUSIC,disturbances of hair the sardonic parts of her face were molested by
2581,MUSIC,sentimental inconsistencies. Her nose was a salient inquisition but her
2582,MUSIC,full mouth had a negroid flash; her chin was coldly bellicose but her
2583,MUSIC,cheeks were softly turned. Beneath her moderate brow her blue and white
2584,MUSIC,eyes were related to glaciers.
2585,MUSIC,
2586,MUSIC,"She sat at an upright piano and trifled with the keys, almost"
2587,MUSIC,inaudibly. It was midnight and an acrimonious man in the next
2588,MUSIC,room often remonstrated with the wall when her piano conversed
2589,MUSIC,too impulsively. Since she was an unknown composer the moment is
2590,MUSIC,appropriate for an attack upon her obscurity. Her music was the
2591,MUSIC,compact Sunday of her life. There she deserted the trite miserliness
2592,MUSIC,of narrative and definite concepts and designed a spacious holiday.
2593,MUSIC,Her notes loafed and romped into inquisitive patterns and were only
2594,MUSIC,intent upon shifting their positions. Thought and emotion presided
2595,MUSIC,over the experimental revels of their servants but issued no narrow
2596,MUSIC,commands and became broadly festive guidances. In her music the rules
2597,MUSIC,of harmony were neither neglected nor worshipped. When they felt an
2598,MUSIC,immense friendliness for the romping of her notes they made a natural
2599,MUSIC,"background: otherwise, they did not intrude. Her music did not strive"
2600,MUSIC,to suggest or interpret concepts and pictures nor did it salaam to
2601,MUSIC,emotions. All three were seconds rising and dying as her sounds changed
2602,MUSIC,their places. The first few notes of each composition were repeated
2603,MUSIC,"above as the title, not because they dominated the piece, but merely as"
2604,MUSIC,a means of identification.
2605,MUSIC,
2606,MUSIC,"In her wanly nondescript room which she did not own, from midnight"
2607,MUSIC,"to dawn, this woman whose face was a bewilderment of contrasts, sat"
2608,MUSIC,furnishing the momentum for a reveling deluge of music. But an evening
2609,MUSIC,decided to interrupt this performance.
2610,MUSIC,
2611,MUSIC,Olga stood in the shop of a neighborhood cobbler. He was a frayed
2612,MUSIC,"apologia, with a scant distraction of gray hair and a dustily crushed"
2613,MUSIC,face.
2614,MUSIC,
2615,MUSIC,"“When you play violin in theater I have heard,” he said. “Maybe you"
2616,MUSIC,would like to hear my boy. He is only eleven but he play almost so good
2617,MUSIC,as you. Maybe you will tell him how he can play better.”
2618,MUSIC,
2619,MUSIC,"Olga followed him to the rear of his shop, with a surface purchase of"
2620,MUSIC,"pity. He trotted out his son, a comedy in light browns relieved by the"
2621,MUSIC,smothered fixity of gray eyes. With whining precision the boy twisted
2622,MUSIC,"his way through Massenet’s Elegy, defending each sliding note with"
2623,MUSIC,his arms and his head. The syrupy embrace of a world stirred upon his
2624,MUSIC,"acceptant face; the whites of his eyes hovered against Olga’s face,"
2625,MUSIC,like a writhing request. In the midst of his playing she turned and
2626,MUSIC,"fled, terror-stricken, down the street."

2634,ETHICS,"Ethel Curn was an acrobat with Hearn’s Twelve Ring Circus, but her"
2635,ETHICS,bones were riveted together by a precariously brittle dignity as she
2636,ETHICS,paraded down the field of daisies to a cliff at the edge of the sea.
2637,ETHICS,Perhaps acrobats walk stiffly during their leisure hours because
2638,ETHICS,"their bodies become ascetic when released from an unreal, sensual"
2639,ETHICS,agility. Ethel Curn sometimes stooped to pick a daisy and her body
2640,ETHICS,"received motion in a deliberately ungallant manner, as though greeting"
2641,ETHICS,an unwelcome mistress. Her face was an indiscreetly torn screen for
2642,ETHICS,emotions that had been dead for many years; her low forehead broke into
2643,ETHICS,the tinily pointed lustres of her features; her body was as slim as a
2644,ETHICS,symbolised cricket’s lament. She crossed the field of daisies intensely
2645,ETHICS,dissolved into a forethought of afternoon and stood underneath a tree
2646,ETHICS,at the edge of the cliff. As she leaned against the tree it seemed as
2647,ETHICS,if a giant had courteously lent his umbrella to a rudely unresponsive
2648,ETHICS,"dwarf. Below her the sea grunted with automatic fury and receded, like"
2649,ETHICS,a pleased actor. Winds threw their weird applause against the blue
2650,ETHICS,and gray rocks. The calmer air underneath the tree was not unlike a
2651,ETHICS,distressed mind caught between the noises.
2652,ETHICS,
2653,ETHICS,Ethel Curn seated herself beneath the tree and read a paper-bound
2654,ETHICS,"novel entitled, “The Fate of Eleanor Martin,” but the sea and the"
2655,ETHICS,rocks interfered too effectively with Eleanor and her pretended life
2656,ETHICS,"slid into the reality at the foot of the tree, while Ethel peered"
2657,ETHICS,aggressively down at the waves. A whim winked its narcotic eye at
2658,ETHICS,her mind--the waves became fellow-workers and she was an audience
2659,ETHICS,critically examining their turns. “A little higher with that green
2660,ETHICS,"somersault! Come on, old chicken, you can do a longer slide if you"
2661,ETHICS,try!” her mind cried amiably. Lost in the syncopation of admiration
2662,ETHICS,her body swayed with the waves and her brown hair went adventuring.
2663,ETHICS,"Then, like a jilted servant, her mood ran from her, brandishing its"
2664,ETHICS,abashed haste over her body. Sorrow struck her face with a crazily gay
2665,ETHICS,second that extinguished her eyes. Her body improvised its lines into a
2666,ETHICS,wilted sexlessness that made her black skirt and pink waist mysterious.
2667,ETHICS,The torture of a lost love had feasted upon her flesh and reduced it
2668,ETHICS,"to an abstraction. Hearn, the circus-master, presided over the feast"
2669,ETHICS,like a chilly urbane magician. Without a trace of sensual longing she
2670,ETHICS,"recalled his little black moustache, standing like a curt intrigue"
2671,ETHICS,"over his lips, and the way in which it had bitten into her mouth"
2672,ETHICS,became the unreal memento of something she had never possessed. Like
2673,ETHICS,"all women gazing back at a departed love, she felt a swindled poverty"
2674,ETHICS,that could not quite decide whether it had once owned wealth or not.
2675,ETHICS,This feeling translated itself in exclamatory vowels that could not
2676,ETHICS,"find the consonants of her past passion. She smiled like a bedraggled,"
2677,ETHICS,"masquerading tragedy. It takes women years to perfect this masquerade,"
2678,ETHICS,but they win a distracted pleasure that guards them from haggling
2679,ETHICS,memories. To generalize about women is to broaden our hope that one
2680,ETHICS,woman may serve for the rest. Philosophers disappointed in love
2681,ETHICS,"often do this, though the man on the street is a fairly adept mimic."
2682,ETHICS,Ethel Curn’s bosom lightly scolded her pink waist and her poignantly
2683,ETHICS,devilish smile almost persuaded her that it was real. All the tragedy
2684,ETHICS,on her face spent itself in a distressed question. In unison with this
2685,ETHICS,proceeding a perturbed monologue within her addressed her vanity which
2686,ETHICS,was silkily perched upon an emotional balcony.

2688,ETHICS,“Hearn treated me white--blue garters with a real diamond in the
2689,ETHICS,"center--he never smiled when he kissed me--God, why couldn’t I keep"
2690,ETHICS,him?--He stayed with me a year and there’s not a woman in the troupe
2691,ETHICS,"who’s had him more than a month--he’s a lying rat, but he never"
2692,ETHICS,smiled when he kissed me--I wonder whether he’d smile if I slit his
2693,ETHICS,throat?--what did I ever see in that fat face--he’ll be a joke in a
2694,ETHICS,few years--they all throw you down unless you get in ahead of them--If
2695,ETHICS,I broke a bottle against his mug I’d only make him happy--it had blue
2696,ETHICS,silk tassles and he paid three hundred for it--I drank too much--blue
2697,ETHICS,silk tassles--He’s better than most of them--I knew what he wanted and
2698,ETHICS,I’m bawling him out because he got it--He treated me white--blue silk
2699,ETHICS,garters with real diamonds that would make the Queen of England wink--”
2700,ETHICS,
2701,ETHICS,The devilishly poignant smile and the monologue met each other within
2702,ETHICS,"her, while fleeing back to their graves, and their unpremeditated"
2703,ETHICS,clash illuminated the renunciation upon her face. She looked into her
2704,ETHICS,"upturned, yellow turban as though it held elusive dregs. Brooding"
2705,ETHICS,"experimented with her head and suddenly threw it to the ground,"
2706,ETHICS,dissatisfied. She lay there like the impoverished effigy of a far off
2707,ETHICS,"love--her black skirt revealed her slim legs, with gloomy discourtesy,"
2708,ETHICS,and her fluffy pink waist gave its babyish sympathy to the sharpness
2709,ETHICS,"of her back. Her slender but muscular arms, stretching over the grass,"
2710,ETHICS,were senseless branches touching the shoulders of the armless effigy.
2711,ETHICS,The wind trifled with her loose brown hair and incited it to ironically
2712,ETHICS,flitting imitations of life. Dead thoughts and emotions united upon her
2713,ETHICS,"hidden face and gripped it with decayed finesse. She rested, perilously"
2714,ETHICS,"unconcerned, upon the sloping edge of the cliff. Suddenly, in a"
2715,ETHICS,"sibilant prank, the earth fled beneath her body and she disappeared."

2718,ETHICS,
2719,ETHICS,They knelt around her prostrate figure hugged by the pale blue
2720,ETHICS,indelicacy of tights and the scant impudence of her yellow bodice.
2721,ETHICS,High above her a little wooden board dangled helplessly from a long
2722,ETHICS,"wire, while another wire hung loosely above it. She opened her eyes"
2723,ETHICS,"and stared, with a lustreless disbelief, at the people who were like a"
2724,ETHICS,tension ready to snap.
2725,ETHICS,
2726,ETHICS,"“Damn him, he did me dirty!” she cried to the amazed, painted faces"
2727,ETHICS,above her.

2733,HISTORY,
2734,HISTORY,
2735,HISTORY,Sunlight stuck to the gray floor like curdled honey and clung to
2736,HISTORY,the black wall like visible fever on the breast of a savage. This
2737,HISTORY,contradiction gave a fugitive radiance to the room in which King
2738,HISTORY,"Ferdinand stood, moulding figures of happiness. On sunless days the"
2739,HISTORY,"room was a depressed insult to his rejoicing, forcing it into adroit"
2740,HISTORY,retorts. He had made this chamber a necessary enemy.
2741,HISTORY,
2742,HISTORY,"As he moulded his figures of happiness, his wife stood beside him,"
2743,HISTORY,ready with colors.
2744,HISTORY,
2745,HISTORY,“You have almost finished this half-pyramid of eyes emerging from a
2746,HISTORY,"flat surface and ending against a vertical wall,” she said, as though"
2747,HISTORY,the sound of her words made their obviousness subtle. “What color shall
2748,HISTORY,I use to excite your design?”
2749,HISTORY,
2750,HISTORY,"King Ferdinand turned to her, like a blind man peering into"
2751,HISTORY,fantastically returning sight. Creative absorption had ruffled his
2752,HISTORY,"middle-aged face into an ageless insurrection, but when he spoke a"
2753,HISTORY,wrinkled order once more reigned beneath the granite lull of his
2754,HISTORY,forehead.
2755,HISTORY,
2756,HISTORY,"“Give each eye a different shade of color and, for the wall, make a"
2757,HISTORY,blue of inhuman brightness: a blue that has swallowed a constellation
2758,HISTORY,"and defies night,” he said. “This form symbolises my last happiness,"
2759,HISTORY,wherein the clashing sequences of my life have been smashed to a
2760,HISTORY,challenging glare. I have become immortal until I voluntarily tender my
2761,HISTORY,"immortality to death, if he takes it.”"
2762,HISTORY,
2763,HISTORY,The wrinkles on King Ferdinand’s cheeks ascended to a sentence of
2764,HISTORY,belief hacked upon his forehead. His broadly cumbersome face shrunk to
2765,HISTORY,a lighter scope and his red moustache shone like a coal of expectation.
2766,HISTORY,His wife played with her dark green gown as though it were relaxed
2767,HISTORY,"gaiety. Her body, like a plump blunder, ended in the deft recklessness"
2768,HISTORY,of her head; the high amber of her face raised its slightly turned
2769,HISTORY,lines of brooding abandon. She looked at her husband as though she
2770,HISTORY,considered his flesh an unimportant tragedy calmed by his words.
2771,HISTORY,
2772,HISTORY,The smell of listening earth drifted through a window and bird-cries
2773,HISTORY,"violated the air, like expiring emotions. King Ferdinand stood in the"
2774,HISTORY,"manner of one to whom motion has become a dim travesty, and the blood"
2775,HISTORY,in his veins was a prisoned resonance. His folded arms were weighted in
2776,HISTORY,a marble posture beneath his long sleeves. Queen Muriel touched his arm
2777,HISTORY,and gave him life. She led him to a corner of the room and unveiled a
2778,HISTORY,"small figure, and her hands were pliant consummations."
2779,HISTORY,
2780,HISTORY,"“My first happiness,” she said, in a voice of climbing distinctness."
2781,HISTORY,They carried the figure to the light. Almost as slim as a personified
2782,HISTORY,"plant-stem, a conventionalised monk grew straight from the center of"
2783,HISTORY,two lean hands cupped into the semblance of a flower-pot. The hands met
2784,HISTORY,each other in an effortless tenderness; the thinly high monk bore the
2785,HISTORY,suggestions of hood and cassock and his face wore a look of indistinct
2786,HISTORY,triumph.
2787,HISTORY,
2788,HISTORY,“And so I like to believe that your happiness has grown uncertainly
2789,HISTORY,"from the rarely caught touch of my hands,” she said."
2790,HISTORY,
2791,HISTORY,The door of the room opened and two men strode in. One of them curved
2792,HISTORY,upward into pompous impatience. The tight inquisitiveness of a gaudy
2793,HISTORY,uniform revealed his tall body. His face was like an expansive
2794,HISTORY,fallacy--large rolls of flesh indecisively interrogated the thin slant
2795,HISTORY,of his nose and slid into the refuge of his brown beard. The second man
2796,HISTORY,was waspishly abbreviated and clad in mincing castrations of color. His
2797,HISTORY,tinily sharp face suggested a soulless beetle.
2798,HISTORY,
2799,HISTORY,"“Have you come, as usual, to bestow your explosive admiration on"
2800,HISTORY,my figures?” said King Ferdinand to the man whose face resembled a
2801,HISTORY,redundant mistake.
2802,HISTORY,
2803,HISTORY,"“Three men of your guard will murder you, with restrained admiration,"
2804,HISTORY,"tomorrow noon,” answered the other man, in whose voice a sneer and"
2805,HISTORY,apprehension were partners in a minuet. “You will be killed on the
2806,HISTORY,palace steps and the cheers of a huge audience will make death’s leer
2807,HISTORY,articulate to you. While you have taken the role of a hermit in an
2808,HISTORY,aesthetic petticoat your friends have been arranging a last happiness
2809,HISTORY,for you. You are considered an imbecile who paints pretty figures with
2810,HISTORY,the blood of his country.”
2811,HISTORY,
2812,HISTORY,The flashing hardnesses of a wintry repose assaulted King Ferdinand’s
2813,HISTORY,face.
2814,HISTORY,
2815,HISTORY,“My brothers are quite willing to use this blood as an unsolicited
2816,HISTORY,"rouge for the lips of their mistresses,” he answered in a tone of"
2817,HISTORY,remotely amused reproach. “I have not assailed my subjects with taxes
2818,HISTORY,or led them to wars and that has been a serious error. They are
2819,HISTORY,"probably in the position of a man with his chains removed, who is angry"
2820,HISTORY,because he has forgotten how to dance!”
2821,HISTORY,
2822,HISTORY,The acridly shortened man spoke.
2823,HISTORY,
2824,HISTORY,"“When you are dead, sire, your brothers will gamble for your throne by"
2825,HISTORY,throwing roses at your head. He who first succeeds in striking your
2826,HISTORY,"bulging eyes, will win.”"
2827,HISTORY,
2828,HISTORY,"“Death does not like to be made a cheated jester,” said King Ferdinand."
2829,HISTORY,“He will doubtless devise a better joke for my winning brother.”
2830,HISTORY,
2831,HISTORY,"Queen Muriel, whose face had grown old with choked disdain, stepped"
2832,HISTORY,forward.
2833,HISTORY,
2834,HISTORY,"“Now that your shrewd bantering has made itself sufficiently nude, tell"
2835,HISTORY,"us why you have come,” she said."
2836,HISTORY,
2837,HISTORY,"The tall man, who carried with him the air of an animated mausoleum,"
2838,HISTORY,spoke.
2839,HISTORY,
2840,HISTORY,“Today I saw an old libertine tottering down the boulevard. Glancing
2841,HISTORY,"to his feet he spied a lily, clipped and fresh. He sidled blithely to"
2842,HISTORY,the edge of the walk to avoid stepping on the flower. There is little
2843,HISTORY,"pleasure, after all, in flattening a child from another world.... My"
2844,HISTORY,"carriage will take you to the frontier, tonight.”"
2845,HISTORY,
2846,HISTORY,“My caprices have never been able to strut gorgeously because they hold
2847,HISTORY,"a sincere sympathy for motion,” said King Ferdinand, still mechanically"
2848,HISTORY,jesting. His hand rose to one cheek as though signaling for a friendly
2849,HISTORY,trance and his eyes closed unceremoniously.
2850,HISTORY,
2851,HISTORY,"“We will take your carriage,” he said in the voice of an abstracted"
2852,HISTORY,tight-rope walker.
2853,HISTORY,
2854,HISTORY,The two men tilted their gaudiness into imperceptible bows and
2855,HISTORY,departed. King Ferdinand and his wife stood staring at each other as
2856,HISTORY,"though their bodies were teasing curtains. Then, without remembering"
2857,HISTORY,"what had occurred, they let gay words poke each other and began to"
2858,HISTORY,discuss colors for the monk’s figure rising from cupped hands and
2859,HISTORY,blossoming into indistinct triumph.
2860,HISTORY,
2861,HISTORY,That night their carriage stopped upon a hilltop and they were killed
2862,HISTORY,by three men. One of the three had a thin nose and a brown beard--the
2863,HISTORY,tight inquisitiveness of a bright uniform revealed his tall body. Among
2864,HISTORY,historians he was to be noted as the man who killed an imbecile king
2865,HISTORY,and led his country to glory and prosperity.

2871,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2872,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2873,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Carl Dell and Anita Starr were speaking of a dead woman who had
2874,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,influenced their eyes. She had also refined their heads to a chill
2875,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"protest. Their faces, involved and disconsolate, had not solved her"
2876,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"absence, and their voices were freighted with a primitive martyrdom."
2877,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Carl was fencing with the end of his youth. His body held that
2878,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,inpenetrable cringing which pretends to ignore the coming of middle age
2879,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"and is only betrayed by rare gestures. He was tall, with a slenderness"
2880,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,that barely escaped being feminine. The upper part of his face was
2881,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"scholarly and the lower part roguish, and the two gave him the effect"
2882,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,of a sprite who has become erudite but still retains the memory of
2883,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"his former identity. His protruding eyes were embarrassed, as though"
2884,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,someone behind them had unexpectedly pushed them from a refuge. With
2885,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,immense finesse they apologised for intruding upon the world. It is
2886,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,almost tautology to say that they were gray. His small brown moustache
2887,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,had a candidly misplaced air as it touched the thin bacchanale of his
2888,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,lips. It was a mourner at the feast.
2889,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2890,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Anita Starr’s form would have seemed stout but for the sweeping
2891,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"discipline of its lines, but this careful suppression ended in a riot"
2892,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"when it came to her face. Her face was a small, lyrical revel that had"
2893,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,terminated in a fight. Her nose and chin were strident but her cheeks
2894,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,and mouth were subtlely unassuming. Her blue eyes brilliantly and
2895,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,impartially aided both sides of the conflict. Glistening spirals of
2896,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,reddish brown hair courted her head.
2897,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2898,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Sitting in the parlor of the Starr home Anita and Carl spoke of a
2899,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,dead woman who had influenced their eyes. It was two A. M. and the
2900,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,atmosphere resembled a disillusioned reminiscence: still and heavy.
2901,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"They had talked about this dead woman throughout the evening,"
2902,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,welcoming any sound that might surprise her profile into life. When
2903,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"alive she had been the chanting whirlpool of their existences, and when"
2904,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,she died sound ceased for them. Their voices became mere copies of its
2905,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,past reign.
2906,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2907,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,“Because I loved her any common pebble became a chance word concerning
2908,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"her and flowers were enthusiastic anecdotes of her presence,” said Carl."
2909,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2910,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,For an hour he had been breaking his love into insatiable
2911,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,variations--one who seduces the fleeting expressions of a past torture.
2912,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2913,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,“She may have been an august vagabond from another planet--a planet
2914,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"where loitering is a solemn profession,” said Anita. “Even when she"
2915,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,performed a menial task she awed it with her thoughtful reluctance.
2916,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"Like a fitful gleaner she crept through bare fields of people,"
2917,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,accepting their bits of laughter and refusal. When she met us she
2918,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"stepped backward, as from a tempting unreality, and knocked against"
2919,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,death.”
2920,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2921,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"Carl sat, like a groveling fantasy weary of attempting to capture"
2922,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"a genuine animation, but Anita had forced herself into a tormented"
2923,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,erectness. The clock struck three. Without a word or glance in each
2924,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"other’s direction they left their chairs, turned out the lights, and"
2925,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"ascended the stairway, Carl slightly in advance. They halted at the"
2926,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,first landing and faced each other with the uncomplaining helplessness
2927,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,of people suddenly scalded by reality.
2928,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2929,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,“In the morning we will eat oranges from a silver dish and glibly cheat
2930,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"our emotions,” said Carl."
2931,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2932,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"“This deftly impolite proceeding never stops to ask our consent,” said"
2933,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Anita in a voice whose lethargy barely observed a satirical twinkle.
2934,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2935,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Another word would have been a ridiculous impropriety. They parted
2936,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,and entered their rooms. Flower scents filtered through Carl’s open
2937,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"window, like softly dismayed sins and the cool repentance of a summer"
2938,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,night glided into his room upon a pathway of moonlight. For a while
2939,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,he sat absent-mindedly burnishing the knives that had divided his
2940,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,evening. After he had undressed he fell upon his bed like one hurriedly
2941,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,obliterating an ordeal. His consciousness played with a black hood;
2942,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,then a crash mastered the room and the door swung open. His blanched
2943,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,face paid a spasmodic tribute to the sound and his grey eyes greeted
2944,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,the darkness as though it were an advancing mob. With a strained
2945,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,stoicism he waited for a repetition of the sound. The moments were
2946,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,sledge-hammers fanning his face with their close passage. Then his bed
2947,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,weirdly meddled with his body and became a light cradle rocked by some
2948,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"arrogant hand. The darkness tingled lifelessly, like an electrocuted"
2949,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,man.
2950,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2951,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Carl’s waiting began to feel sharply disgraced and his senses planned
2952,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,a revolt. He tried to rise to a sitting posture but his body insulted
2953,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,his desire. At this point the darkness softened to the disguised
2954,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,struggle of a woman striving to reach him. The significance of this
2955,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,cast an impalpable but potent consolation upon the straining of his
2956,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,chained body. The rocking of his bed measured a powerfully cryptic
2957,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,welcome and he tried to decipher it with the beat of his heart. Each
2958,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,of its syllables became the cadenced impact of another person against
2959,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,a toughly pliant wall. His body demolished its tenseness and pressed a
2960,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,refrain into the swaying bed. He decorated the darkness with the crisp
2961,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,flight of his voice.
2962,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2963,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"“Perish upon the turmoil of each day and make it inaudible, but let the"
2964,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"night be our hermitage,” he cried to a dead woman. As though replying,"
2965,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,the rocking of his bed gradually lessened and the darkness became
2966,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,an opaque farewell. He turned to the shaft of moonlight which was
2967,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,tactfully intercepting the floor of his room; it had the unobtrusive
2968,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,intensity of a melted Chinaman. For hours he gave it his eyes and dimly
2969,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,contradicted it with his heart. When the dawn made his room aware of
2970,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"its limitations, he closed his eyes."
2971,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2972,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,At the breakfast table he and Anita greeted each other with a worn
2973,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,brevity: their eyes found an empty solace in the white tablecloth
2974,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"and their minds felt a bright impotence, like beggars idling in the"
2975,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,sun. For a while the tinkle of their spoons amiably pardoned their
2976,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"constraint, but Anita finally spoke with the staccato of one who snaps"
2977,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,unbearable thongs.
2978,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2979,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,“She came to me last night. I heard a sound like a huge menace
2980,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,stumbling over a chair. The door opened and the darkness grew as heavy
2981,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,as dead flesh. My bed swayed with the precision of a grieving head.”
2982,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2983,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Carl’s face broke and gleamed like a soft ground flogged by sudden rain.
2984,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2985,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"“The same things happened to me,” he said in the voice of a child"
2986,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,wrestling with a minor chord.
2987,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2988,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,They sat heavily disputing each other with their eyes.
2989,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2990,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"“Did you lie afterwards, censuring the moonlight?” asked Anita."
2991,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2992,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,Carl nodded. Anita’s mother majestically blundered into the room.
2993,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"Exuberantly substantial, with the face of a child skillfully rebuked by"
2994,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"an elderly masquerade, she flattered a chair at the table."
2995,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,
2996,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"“Wasn’t that a terrible storm we had last night,” she babbled. “The"
2997,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,"rain kept me awake for hours--I’m such a light sleeper, you know. I do"
2998,PSYCHIC PHENOMENA,hope you children managed to rest.”

3005,LOVE,
3006,LOVE,The night received the moonlight in the manner of a sophisticated
3007,LOVE,"braggart who slaps the face of an old, impassive man. Mrs. Robert"
3008,LOVE,Calvin Taylor observed this illusion and painted it upon one of the
3009,LOVE,lanterns lighting a little party within her heart. The guests at the
3010,LOVE,"party, fat sophists and slatterns in gay, patched clothes, gathered"
3011,LOVE,around the lantern and felt relieved at the impersonal novelty of its
3012,LOVE,decoration. If Mrs. Robert Calvin Taylor had been a philosopher or a
3013,LOVE,"scientist she would have changed the night to an unseen background, or"
3014,LOVE,a chemical diagram; she would have ignored the pleading of her heart
3015,LOVE,"for pictorial distraction. But since she was a society-woman, tired"
3016,LOVE,"of sensual toys and a mental twilight, she welcomed the night as her"
3017,LOVE,first effectual lover. Sitting in the garden of her country home she
3018,LOVE,"could see the lighted windows of her crowded ballroom, and hear the"
3019,LOVE,saccharine pandemonium of a jazz orchestra. The noise reminded her of a
3020,LOVE,"middle-aged roué, snickering as he rolled his huge dice while gambling"
3021,LOVE,"for a new mistress. She felt glad that her new lover, the night, did"
3022,LOVE,not seek to court her with such a blustering clatter.
3023,LOVE,
3024,LOVE,The night was incredibly sophisticated but held the pungently awkward
3025,LOVE,"body of a youth, crashing against trees and bushes. This mixture"
3026,LOVE,pierced Mrs. Robert Calvin Taylor and slid far beneath those sensual
3027,LOVE,routines which are the delight of psycho-analysts--slid to a depth
3028,LOVE,where aesthetic passion slays the flesh and blends it into a sexless
3029,LOVE,potency. She felt a sense of bodiless conflagration striding with wide
3030,LOVE,"steps beside the night. When the limitless glow died within her, she"
3031,LOVE,glanced down and found that she was naked. The complicated shrewdness
3032,LOVE,of her clothes had disappeared.
3033,LOVE,
3034,LOVE,By this time she had ceased to be Mrs. Robert Calvin Taylor--she had
3035,LOVE,"become an expectant novice in a new world, and even the jazz music"
3036,LOVE,and ballroom laughter had changed to the mumbled rumours of a past
3037,LOVE,existence. Therefore her nakedness failed to disconcert her. She
3038,LOVE,"touched her shoulder, with a gesture of matter-of-fact congratulation,"
3039,LOVE,and loosened her hair to rid herself of a last dab of incongruity.
3040,LOVE,Then she rose from the stone bench and walked down a pathway leading
3041,LOVE,to the great lake that bounded one side of her country estate. She
3042,LOVE,felt the powerful and sober curiosity of one who has decided to become
3043,LOVE,a recluse and examines the deserted possibilities of his roofless
3044,LOVE,plateau. She reached a high bluff rising over the placid vanity of
3045,LOVE,"the huge lake, combing its bluish black hair with moonlight. Suddenly"
3046,LOVE,she became aware of a figure standing beside her. She turned with
3047,LOVE,a gasp of strangled aloofness. The ethereal composure of her small
3048,LOVE,"face, defended by moonlight, sheered into an ebony cast of hermit-like"
3049,LOVE,annoyance. But when the color and outlines of the figure shrunk within
3050,LOVE,"her eyes, her face changed again. An astounded immersion crowned her"
3051,LOVE,"head, tugging at her short nose, straightening her thick lips, and"
3052,LOVE,cleaving her gray eyes. The slightly deteriorated slenderness of her
3053,LOVE,"short body lowered a bit toward the earth, not from fear but because"
3054,LOVE,of a weakening incredulity. The figure before her was that of a
3055,LOVE,"sexless human being, small and slim of statute, nude, and hued with"
3056,LOVE,an inhumanly concentrated black. The head held large eyes that shone
3057,LOVE,"like metaphysical diamonds, as though ten thousand stars were carousing"
3058,LOVE,"together, in a realm of compressed light. The figure spoke to Mrs."
3059,LOVE,"Robert Calvin Taylor, and its voice seemed thrown forth by the rays"
3060,LOVE,from its eyes. The voice was distinct and subdued.
3061,LOVE,
3062,LOVE,"“You are not a hermit who has turned a garden into a solitary castle,”"
3063,LOVE,said the figure.
3064,LOVE,
3065,LOVE,“What am I?” asked Mrs. Robert Calvin Taylor.
3066,LOVE,
3067,LOVE,"“Your mind and heart are no longer clad in their heavy mirages of love,"
3068,LOVE,"fear, and sleep,” said the figure. “The surface pictures have gone and"
3069,LOVE,the twin bazaars of your heart and mind are exchanging a long-deferred
3070,LOVE,greeting. Within the now mingled bazaars emotions and thoughts have
3071,LOVE,"become friends and sell each other endless variations in color, light,"
3072,LOVE,and form. I am the being who rules this proceeding.”
3073,LOVE,
3074,LOVE,"“Have you a name?” asked Mrs. Robert Calvin Taylor, using the unashamed"
3075,LOVE,naïveté of a child.
3076,LOVE,
3077,LOVE,"“Men call me Aesthetics,” answered the figure. “In my weakest form"
3078,LOVE,"I make the eyes of the shop-girl hesitate a bit, as she views an"
3079,LOVE,unusually gaudy sunset. In my strongest manifestations I help poets and
3080,LOVE,artists to contradict their personal lives. But these are merely my
3081,LOVE,"outward indications. I line the hearts and minds of all human beings,"
3082,LOVE,"often remaining within them, unfelt, until they die. In rare cases such"
3083,LOVE,"as yours the mirages hiding and dividing me are slain, and I clap my"
3084,LOVE,"hands, sending motion to the twin bazaars of heart and mind.”"
3085,LOVE,
3086,LOVE,“What caused me to uncover you within myself?” said Mrs. Robert Calvin
3087,LOVE,Taylor.
3088,LOVE,
3089,LOVE,“You yielded to a whim and made the night your lover. Dissatisfied with
3090,LOVE,"the loves and fears he found within you, the night threw them aside,"
3091,LOVE,"one by one, thus slaying the mirages that hid me. Your other lovers"
3092,LOVE,of the past were content with more material gifts and did not seek to
3093,LOVE,uncover you.”
3094,LOVE,
3095,LOVE,“I am bare now. What will you do with me?” said Mrs. Robert Calvin
3096,LOVE,Taylor. The figure laid a hand upon her shoulder. His eyes burnt her to
3097,LOVE,a petal of ashes that fell down between them.

3100,LOVE,
3101,LOVE,"Mr. Robert Calvin Taylor stood over the form of his young wife, who"
3102,LOVE,sat slouched down upon a stone bench within their garden. He shook her
3103,LOVE,"shoulder, lightly. She uttered a perturbed mumble and did not raise the"
3104,LOVE,head resting upon one of her arms. The moonlight fell upon the silken
3105,LOVE,complexities of her dress.
3106,LOVE,
3107,LOVE,"“Poor Dot, I warned her not to take a third glass,” he muttered to"
3108,LOVE,himself as he raised her in his arms and staggered down the garden
3109,LOVE,pathway.
