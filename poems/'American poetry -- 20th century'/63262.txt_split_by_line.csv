113,PEGASUS,"Once in a saffron twilight, rich with the sound of bells,"
114,PEGASUS,"In a dim meadow straying, high on the lonely fells,"
115,PEGASUS,"I saw Pegasus, winged Pegasus, cropping the asphodels."
116,PEGASUS,
117,PEGASUS,"His neck was clothed with thunder, his feet with strength were shod;"
118,PEGASUS,"Terrible in his beauty, he grazed on the starry sod,"
119,PEGASUS,"A white, untameable beauty, a stallion fit for a god."
120,PEGASUS,
121,PEGASUS,"Meekly he ranged unfettered; his wings were wet with dew,"
122,PEGASUS,"And where they trailed in the blossomy grass, a misty rainbow grew,"
123,PEGASUS,"Those strong, exultant pinions that trample the windy blue."
124,PEGASUS,
125,PEGASUS,Then suddenly he raised his head. I felt the pulsing beat
126,PEGASUS,"Of his valiant hoofs. He sprang on the track of the stars, unleashed"
127,PEGASUS,and fleet.
128,PEGASUS,I was alone; but deep in the grass was the print of his deathless
129,PEGASUS,feet.

138,IN OCTOBER,From a thinning tree
139,IN OCTOBER,Jove comes down.
140,IN OCTOBER,"Naked, brown,"
141,IN OCTOBER,The earth lies Danae.
142,IN OCTOBER,
143,IN OCTOBER,Still she lies with hushed breath;
144,IN OCTOBER,Through each dreaming clod
145,IN OCTOBER,Runs the fire
146,IN OCTOBER,"Of desire,"
147,IN OCTOBER,Passion of a god.
148,IN OCTOBER,
149,IN OCTOBER,Danae lies in her dark tower.
150,IN OCTOBER,On a March hillside

161,SLEEP,"Last night I slid into the sea of sleep,"
162,SLEEP,"Translucent, cool and deep."
163,SLEEP,I left my dusty self upon the sand
164,SLEEP,"Like an old garment. Naked, free,"
165,SLEEP,I felt the waves close over me;
166,SLEEP,"The curious, eager water pressed"
167,SLEEP,Against the white curve of my breast.
168,SLEEP,"Then deep, deep"
169,SLEEP,Through the green depths I sank
170,SLEEP,Into the sea of sleep.
171,SLEEP,
172,SLEEP,"This morning I rose out of the dark tide,"
173,SLEEP,"I rose through darkness, and there was no light,"
174,SLEEP,No radiance to illume
175,SLEEP,The dusk; only the pallid gloom
176,SLEEP,"Of sleep. First green, then blue,"
177,SLEEP,"Then the thin water parted, and the sun shone through."
178,SLEEP,There lay my body; strangely it was I.
179,SLEEP,
180,SLEEP,What did I bring back from the soundless deep
181,SLEEP,"From that grey, ancient sea of sleep:—"
182,SLEEP,
183,SLEEP,"The glint of sunken gold, the plaintive knell"
184,SLEEP,"Of some drowned bell,"
185,SLEEP,Remembrance vague and dim
186,SLEEP,"Of ghostly argosies,"
187,SLEEP,"The misty shores of far Hesperides,"
188,SLEEP,"The wraith of mermaids beckoning white and slim,"
189,SLEEP,The faint sea-music of a curvéd shell.

230,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,Within the azure shadow of her veil.
231,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"Here in this shrine she seems remote, apart,"
232,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"For the dim centuries have quenched her fire,"
233,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,The slow years molded her to their desire.
234,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"Ah, still she knows"
235,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,The ecstasy that glows
236,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,In my wild heart!
237,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"Once, not submissive, meek"
238,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"With pensive brow and duteous cheek,"
239,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"There came a cry exultant, strong;"
240,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,“My soul doth magnify the Lord!”
241,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,Clear as a ringing sword
242,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,I hear her song.
243,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,In high humility
244,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,She knew herself to be
245,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"The Chosen of God, the Gate of the Divine."
246,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"I kneel before her shrine,"
247,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"I gaze upon her tranquil face,"
248,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"Hail Mary, full of grace!"
249,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"I, too, know Love,"

252,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"All joy, all woe;"
253,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,The Son of God she laid to rest
254,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"Upon her breast,"
255,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,"She knew the wounded Hands,"
256,OUR LADY OF UNDERSTANDING,And there is nothing else to know.

287,SACRAMENT,Under the high blue heavens of June
288,SACRAMENT,"In summer’s poppied heat,"
289,SACRAMENT,I worked at homely common tasks
290,SACRAMENT,Sharp stubble ’neath my feet.
291,SACRAMENT,But I was not alone; I knew
292,SACRAMENT,A comradeship most sweet.
293,SACRAMENT,
294,SACRAMENT,For as I gathered up the sheaves
295,SACRAMENT,"And bound the heavy grain,"
296,SACRAMENT,"One whispered: “Yea, the world needs Food;"
297,SACRAMENT,"Hungry it goes, and fain"
298,SACRAMENT,"Am I to be its Bread, and give"
299,SACRAMENT,My Body for its pain.
300,SACRAMENT,For this I lay in the dark earth
301,SACRAMENT,Through sun and singing rain.”
302,SACRAMENT,
303,SACRAMENT,"Into the vineyard I was sent,"
304,SACRAMENT,There One was keeping tryst.
305,SACRAMENT,I cut the grapes—how beautiful
306,SACRAMENT,Their bloomy amethyst!
307,SACRAMENT,"He said “This is my Blood, the Wine"
308,SACRAMENT,"Poured for the world, ye wist."
309,SACRAMENT,In wheat and grape ye work with me
310,SACRAMENT,To make my Eucharist.”

321,TRUTH IN A WELL,Far from the friendly sod.
322,TRUTH IN A WELL,
323,TRUTH IN A WELL,And suddenly I was afraid—

390,THE POOL,The polished lacquered traceries
391,THE POOL,Until a whimpering breeze
392,THE POOL,Breaks the design at will.

395,THE POOL,"Eyeless fish and blind,"
396,THE POOL,Some silver coloured as a star

398,THE POOL,Sinister their beauties are

419,LARKSPUR,"The wind with touch most delicate,"
420,LARKSPUR,Went up and down the scale—
421,LARKSPUR,"Wine-dark, frail amethyst, and blue,"
422,LARKSPUR,Blue as Our Lady’s veil.
423,LARKSPUR,
424,LARKSPUR,"You played softly to yourself,"

915,HORSE CHESTNUTS,In April my horse chestnuts
916,HORSE CHESTNUTS,Were beautiful to see!
917,HORSE CHESTNUTS,Tapers set on every bough
918,HORSE CHESTNUTS,Like candles on a tree.
919,HORSE CHESTNUTS,But now in late October
920,HORSE CHESTNUTS,With frosty nights and cold
921,HORSE CHESTNUTS,There is more poignant beauty
922,HORSE CHESTNUTS,In their dim tarnished gold.

930,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"Then Jesus said, “I thirst”, and there was one"
931,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"Who filled a spunge, and put it to His mouth—"
932,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,An unknown Roman soldier—his the joy
933,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,In the three hours to quench that sacred drouth.
934,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,
935,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"They had been dicing, and the seamless coat"
936,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,Had fallen to him. Now the thick darkness came
937,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,Over the land. He watched the Crucified
938,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"Wondering, in doubt, this soldier without name."
939,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,
940,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,“Bacchus! The Jew knew how to die. The nails
941,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,Were blunt. He neither railed nor cursed.
942,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,Even the sturdy thief had called him ‘Lord’”.
943,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"At the ninth hour there came the cry, “I thirst”."
944,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,
945,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"The Roman held the vinegar to his lips,"
946,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,And looked with pity on His dying Face.
947,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"O Unknown Soldier, pray for me to give"
948,THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER,"My love’s poor wine, and give it with such grace."

956,THE FALLOW FIELDS,Let the fields lie fallow

958,THE FALLOW FIELDS,Let the great winds stride over them
959,THE FALLOW FIELDS,And the snow come down.
960,THE FALLOW FIELDS,
961,THE FALLOW FIELDS,Let them lie open to the sun
962,THE FALLOW FIELDS,"To the patient rain,"
963,THE FALLOW FIELDS,And the dews whiten them
964,THE FALLOW FIELDS,E’er they yield again.
965,THE FALLOW FIELDS,
966,THE FALLOW FIELDS,"Plough in the sturdy weed,"
967,THE FALLOW FIELDS,"The common flower,"
968,THE FALLOW FIELDS,Let their wild vigor yield
969,THE FALLOW FIELDS,A lusty dower.
970,THE FALLOW FIELDS,
971,THE FALLOW FIELDS,Then after sun and snow
972,THE FALLOW FIELDS,After dew and sleet
973,THE FALLOW FIELDS,From the earth will spring the green

985,THE PATTERAN,I love the dancing feet.
986,THE PATTERAN,
987,THE PATTERAN,I long to up and follow them
988,THE PATTERAN,Over the rolling moor;
989,THE PATTERAN,"I sicken of my own hearth-fire,"
990,THE PATTERAN,The lilacs by the door.
991,THE PATTERAN,
992,THE PATTERAN,I long to see the sweep of stars
993,THE PATTERAN,Wheel nightly overhead;
994,THE PATTERAN,I want the four strong winds to be
995,THE PATTERAN,The four posts of my bed.
996,THE PATTERAN,
997,THE PATTERAN,I long to wake at dawn
998,THE PATTERAN,"When all the world is grey and cool,"
999,THE PATTERAN,And slip into the lonely depth
1000,THE PATTERAN,Of a mountain pool.
1001,THE PATTERAN,
1002,THE PATTERAN,Three meals my wife sets for me—
1003,THE PATTERAN,Enough for any man.
