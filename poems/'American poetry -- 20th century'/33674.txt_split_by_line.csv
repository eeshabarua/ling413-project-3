65,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
66,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_My dear Cornwall Hollis_:
67,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
68,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_With the Allied cause crumbling away it is high time we thought of
69,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"aesthetics. As a triste jest I said that to you the other day, and your"
70,_ADVERTISEMENT_,reply was a plea to let you write a preface for a new edition of my
71,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"forgotten Sonnets from the Patagonian. I am at last persuaded, and who"
72,_ADVERTISEMENT_,but you should do the preface?_
73,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
74,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_With Mitteleuropa a fact it should be apparent to any honest, thinking"
75,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"man that we are losing the War. Perhaps, in a larger sense, we have"
76,_ADVERTISEMENT_,already lost the War and the dusk of the Anglo-Saxon is come. Then we
77,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"are at last joined with the Héllenes and Latins in the descending scale,"
78,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"and it is the Teuton now approaching the perihelion, with the Slav, yet"
79,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"to conquer, in the far distance. But that is an eye-survey for eternity,"
80,_ADVERTISEMENT_,and we have merely to do with the finite present. So we may still think
81,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"of resistance, and not yet abandon hope of postponing defeat._"
82,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
83,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_It is now the hour for the supreme test of America, and she too must"
84,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"fail, as our Allies have failed, before the Huns unless somewhere she"
85,_ADVERTISEMENT_,can find the beauty and the strength of the human soul with which to
86,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"give battle. For the first time in history it is souls, not guns, that"
87,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"will win the War, and remember, my dear friend, that Beauty is more"
88,_ADVERTISEMENT_,necessary than food that the soul may live._
89,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
90,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_We are all but engulfed in error. We say that we do not hate the German
91,_ADVERTISEMENT_,people; it is the Kaiser we are fighting. A pitiful self-delusion! It
92,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"must be the German people we hate as an overshadowing race, if our fight"
93,_ADVERTISEMENT_,is to have even the excuse of the inflamed passion of the survival of
94,_ADVERTISEMENT_,the fittest. We must acknowledge the Kaiser as the symbol of the best
95,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"organized form of government, unless we are frankly anarchists; the most"
96,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"efficient, the most powerful, the most nearly approaching a practical"
97,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"socialism. Let us, therefore, start afresh. We hate the German people,"
98,_ADVERTISEMENT_,for they have threatened our complacent supremacy as lords of the world.
99,_ADVERTISEMENT_,Now we are at least truthful._
100,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
101,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_Thus far, the Allies have failed signally as a military force. The"
102,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Europeans have forgotten how to fight, and we in America have never"
103,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"learned. We have put too much faith in materialism, and betrayed the"
104,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Soul and Beauty. There is more to life than living, and more to an army"
105,_ADVERTISEMENT_,than arms. The moment is here that demands we scrap the military
106,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"leaders, as such, and seek stronger. Why not then turn to the Poets to"
107,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"direct the War, for, lo! it was the Poets who in seven days won the"
108,_ADVERTISEMENT_,Irish Revolution. None knows better than you how I begrudge giving the
109,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"ever-turbulent West Britons any praise, any glory, but there is the"
110,_ADVERTISEMENT_,simple truth. They vanquished the foe because they first had conquered
111,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"fear, and then nought could stand against them._"
112,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
113,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_If we could purge ourselves of our fear of Germany we should capture
114,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Berlin. Could I enlist a Battalion of Irreproachables, whose uniforms"
115,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"should be walking suit, top hat and pumps, and their only weapon an"
116,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"ebony stick, and sail tomorrow, we should march down Unter den Linden in"
117,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"a month, provided wrapped in our kerchiefs we carried the Gospel of"
118,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Beauty, and a nonchalance in the knot of our cravats._"
119,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
120,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_Verily, verily, men are killed solely because they fear death, and turn"
121,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"their backs on Beauty, for only ugliness and error can destroy, and"
122,_ADVERTISEMENT_,ugliness in the end destroys itself._
123,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
124,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_There is really no horror in the War. Even in the ridiculous way we are
125,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"now fighting it is all a shabby, stupid sham. That chap Griffith gave us"
126,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"a more realistic spectacle in ""The Birth of a Nation."" Far too few men"
127,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"are actually killed and wounded, and the job is much too large for the"
128,_ADVERTISEMENT_,materialists. They do not know how to employ effectively the huge forces
129,_ADVERTISEMENT_,they have raised into being._
130,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
131,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_If somehow we can grope our way back to the springs of Beauty all may
132,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"yet be saved, but it will require the sacrifice of everything we have."
133,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"For myriads it will mean the offering of their lives, for that is all"
134,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"they possess, and it must be done freely, gladly, with their souls"
135,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"purified, if it is to avail anything. Pride, ambition, selfishness,"
136,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"self-will must go, or we perish blind miserables._"
137,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
138,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_For myself, you know I am willingly in service as a common soldier,"
139,_ADVERTISEMENT_,although some years beyond conscription age. Ungrudgingly I gave up
140,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"alcohol--almost a lifelong necessity--and for months I, the Epicurean,"
141,_ADVERTISEMENT_,have been dispassionately measuring the supposed hardships of war that I
142,_ADVERTISEMENT_,might truly understand what a soldier has to undergo. With Beauty in the
143,_ADVERTISEMENT_,bloodbeat privation is nothing. What can touch me now except the amusing
144,_ADVERTISEMENT_,joy of giving up for the common good? Yet who actually loves humankind
145,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"less than I? But the subordination idea intrigues me, possesses me,"
146,_ADVERTISEMENT_,satisfies me. How better can I prove my patent of snobbery and my innate
147,_ADVERTISEMENT_,right cordially to dislike my fellowmen?_
148,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
149,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_The social degradation involved in functioning as an enlisted man was
150,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"and, of course, is the worst of the annoyances. I am neither young"
151,_ADVERTISEMENT_,enough nor sufficiently democratic to enjoy day after day a
152,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"below-stairs status. It is a trial, I confess, but I venture to persuade"
153,_ADVERTISEMENT_,myself that I do all that is required of me with admirable abasement and
154,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"detachment. Occasionally, indeed, it is capital fun to play the"
155,_ADVERTISEMENT_,anonymous cipher. I am often urged to obtain a commission. But I cannot
156,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"quite do that, for would not that be a confession that I hadn't the"
157,_ADVERTISEMENT_,pluck to stick it out? I must remain as I am. Many of my contemporaries
158,_ADVERTISEMENT_,are finding the khaki an easy means of increasing their literary
159,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"reputations. Wise brothers, ye have chosen your rôles. I prefer mine._"
160,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
161,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_Before you have seen my book through the press I may be dead. With all
162,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"my heart I hope I shall not come back, for then impersonally I shall"
163,_ADVERTISEMENT_,have fallen for a cause in which I have no faith. What more
164,_ADVERTISEMENT_,distinguished end for an incurable poseur? Have I not been called that?
165,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Plant, I beg you, mignonette to encircle my arrowroot fields._"
166,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
167,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_What has all this to do with the Sonnets from the Patagonian? If you
168,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"will read my words aright they will give the key to my poems, should"
169,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"you, my beloved Hollis, still lack a key. The volume when it first"
170,_ADVERTISEMENT_,appeared was not liked by divers nice people--it was thought nasty--but
171,_ADVERTISEMENT_,none put it down till he had finished it; a terror was on him lest he
172,_ADVERTISEMENT_,miss a word. And the terror was the Sword of Beauty which slayeth all.
173,_ADVERTISEMENT_,Intrepidity...._
174,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
175,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_But you shall interpret the poems yourself._

277,IN THE VICES,And none can ever follow where he flies.
278,IN THE VICES,He streaks himself with vices tenderly;
279,IN THE VICES,"He cradles sin, and with a figleaf fan"
280,IN THE VICES,"Taps his green cat, watching a bored sun span"
281,IN THE VICES,The wasted minutes to eternity.

283,IN THE VICES,"Once I took up his trail along the dark,"
284,IN THE VICES,"Wishful to track him to the witches' flame,"

331,LOVING KINDNESS,"For the whip blanched her blood, though every vein"
332,LOVING KINDNESS,"Flooded with hate shot a hot flow of pain,"
333,LOVING KINDNESS,And her screams were muffled by a brackish fog.
334,LOVING KINDNESS,"He loved her, yet his passion could but fret"
335,LOVING KINDNESS,Unless he lashed her to an awkward rage--
336,LOVING KINDNESS,But when his hand wrote terror on her page
337,LOVING KINDNESS,He knew exultant joy of feigned regret.
338,LOVING KINDNESS,
339,LOVING KINDNESS,"Theirs was a bond that poured the wine of fear,"
340,LOVING KINDNESS,And he drained her stiffened limbs with cruel art.
341,LOVING KINDNESS,He taught her that all tenderness had fled
342,LOVING KINDNESS,"Till she would beg the hurt to taste the tear,"
343,LOVING KINDNESS,And when she bent to kiss her quivering heart
344,LOVING KINDNESS,It lit a Chinese candle in his head.

393,FAILURE AT FORTY,Time that had marked him for the least of sages
394,FAILURE AT FORTY,"Pointed the hour, and several blotted pages"
395,FAILURE AT FORTY,Stood witness to the struggle in the night.

399,FAILURE AT FORTY,Alternative to sinking out of sight.

401,FAILURE AT FORTY,This much was sure--he never need retrace;

426,ASPENS AT CRESHEIM,Since there was nought her human love could do
427,ASPENS AT CRESHEIM,To give him the last access to her soul.
428,ASPENS AT CRESHEIM,Returning came his years as wholly vain--

484,HER SMILE,
485,HER SMILE,"Her hidden smile was full of little breasts,"
486,HER SMILE,"And with her too white hands she stroked her fears,"
487,HER SMILE,"The while the serpent peered at her arched ears,"
488,HER SMILE,"And night's grim hours stalked in, unbidden guests."
489,HER SMILE,"A noise was in her eyes that sang of scorn,"
490,HER SMILE,"And round her voice there gleamed a nameless dread,"
491,HER SMILE,"As though her lips were hungry for the dead,"
492,HER SMILE,Yet knew the food of dawn would be forlorn.
493,HER SMILE,
494,HER SMILE,"The cold hours ebbed, and still she held her throne;"
495,HER SMILE,"Across the sky the lightning made mad play,"
496,HER SMILE,And then the scarlet screams stood forth revealed.
497,HER SMILE,"She turned her back, and grasped a monotone;"
498,HER SMILE,It answered all; she lived again that day
499,HER SMILE,She triumphed in the tragic turnip field.

509,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"And she was sad since she could not be sad,"
510,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,And every star fled amorous from the sky.
511,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,Her pampered knees fell under her keen eye
512,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,And it came to her she would not go mad.
513,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"The gaucheries were turning the last screw,"
514,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"But there was still the island in the sea,"
515,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"The harridan chorus of eternity,"
516,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,That let her smile because he saw she knew.
517,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,
518,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"She even dared be impudent again,"
519,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,And bit his ear; the deaths were far away.
520,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,A Black Mass sounded from the treasure vaults--
521,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"She tried to rouge her heart, yet quite in vain."
522,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,"The crucifix danced in, beribboned, gay,"
523,THE LAST DANCE AT DAWN,And lisped to her a wish for the next waltz.

541,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,"He polished snubs till they were regnant art,"
542,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,Curling their shameless toilets round the hour.
543,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,Each lay upon his lips an exquisite flower
544,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,Subtly malign and poisoned for its part.
545,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,The path of victims was no wanton plan--
546,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,"He had bowed his head in sorrow at his birth,"
547,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,For he had said long ere he came to earth
548,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,That it was no place for a gentleman.
549,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,
550,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,"But always a heart-scald lurked behind the screen,"
551,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,And somehow he missed the ultimate degrees.
552,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,He saw a beggar at the daylight's fall
553,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,And then he rose and robbed him for the scene;
554,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,And when they called him cad he found release--
555,IN THE GENTLEMANLY INTEREST,He felt he had used the finest snub of all.

575,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"Her white words made the hour seem cool and kind,"
576,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,Hung with soft dawns that danced a shadow fete.
577,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"A silken silence crept up from the South,"
578,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"The flutes were hushed that mimed the orange moon,"
579,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"And down the willow stream my sighs were strewn,"
580,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,While I knelt to the corners of her mouth.
581,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,
582,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"Lead me afar from clamorous dissonance,"
583,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"For I am sick of empty trumpetings,"
584,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,Choking the highways with a dusty noise.
585,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,"Here I have found her sweet sheer utterance,"
586,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,And now I seek the garden of the wings
587,BUVEUSE D'ABSINTHE,Where I may bathe in sounds that life destroys.

600,EXTREME UNCTION,"For Beauty pleaded from the charnel house,"
601,EXTREME UNCTION,For violet nights and violent carouse

604,EXTREME UNCTION,"Crapulous hands reach out to strangle thee,"
605,EXTREME UNCTION,"And every moment is a winding-sheet,"

619,THE JADE VASE,"He had hunted for it to the alley's end,"
620,THE JADE VASE,"Yet when he found the jade vase he was sad,"
621,THE JADE VASE,Low-pulsed with ennui for the praise he had
622,THE JADE VASE,Poured into bowls that merely did not offend.
623,THE JADE VASE,"A wall of glass held back his worshipping,"
624,THE JADE VASE,And his eyes that drank this miracle of stone
625,THE JADE VASE,Acknowledged the discovery not his own--
626,THE JADE VASE,"Still the vase was there, and that was everything."
627,THE JADE VASE,
628,THE JADE VASE,"He thought back over all the songs he had sung,"
629,THE JADE VASE,And all the hours his heart like waving grain
630,THE JADE VASE,Had swayed to music. And the joys now dead
631,THE JADE VASE,Seemed haunting coins to meagre beauty flung.
632,THE JADE VASE,Poignantly he longed to call them back. In vain!
633,THE JADE VASE,But they were the last words that the poet said.

650,EPICEDE,"He lives in pawn, pledging a battered name;"
651,EPICEDE,"He loves his failures as one might love fame,"
652,EPICEDE,And listens for the ghost years as they speak.
653,EPICEDE,"A fragrance bright and broken clasps his head,"
654,EPICEDE,"And wildwood airs sing a frayed interlude,"
655,EPICEDE,While cloaked he comes in a new attitude
656,EPICEDE,To play gravedigger if the word be said.
657,EPICEDE,
658,EPICEDE,"He swore he would be glad and only glad,"
659,EPICEDE,And turned to Broadway for the peace of God.
660,EPICEDE,"He found it at the bottom of the glass,"
661,EPICEDE,"For where the dregs lay it was less than sad,"
662,EPICEDE,And mid the murmur when the dance was trod
663,EPICEDE,He heard the echo of a genius pass.

671,IN THE FALKLANDS,"For his soul when homeless then is at home,"
672,IN THE FALKLANDS,And in a paradise where shadows wane
673,IN THE FALKLANDS,He draws droll figures on the windowpane
674,IN THE FALKLANDS,To lure his vagrom fellow souls to Rome.
675,IN THE FALKLANDS,"There is a potent rancour in the moon,"
676,IN THE FALKLANDS,"Hunting for those who love him still, three"
677,IN THE FALKLANDS,Gleam back. But with detached anxiety
678,IN THE FALKLANDS,He vows that he will alienate them soon.
679,IN THE FALKLANDS,
680,IN THE FALKLANDS,"He said that love had but two words, the last"
681,IN THE FALKLANDS,"And first, and joy in flying laces lay."
682,IN THE FALKLANDS,He watched each kiss to kill it at stark ease--
683,IN THE FALKLANDS,His strangler's hands carve prayers for the past--
684,IN THE FALKLANDS,And chastely he spends an hour every day
685,IN THE FALKLANDS,Erecting tombstones to carnalities.

693,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"The fictive tear he holds in reverence,"
694,THE NOON OF NIGHT,And studies heady griefs that wash the cheek;
695,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"It is a dim dominion he must seek,"
696,THE NOON OF NIGHT,To gain some raiment for his impotence.
697,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"Sorrows are numbered, the sighs have their strings,"
698,THE NOON OF NIGHT,And barren smiles are trained for tragedy;
699,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"He ties up parcels of mock gaiety,"
700,THE NOON OF NIGHT,And labels them with many worshippings.
701,THE NOON OF NIGHT,
702,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"Grapes in the grass, and every day a waste"
703,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"At scattered sources of lost loveliness,"
704,THE NOON OF NIGHT,With drunkenness to drain the ruined seats.
705,THE NOON OF NIGHT,He knows his gems are turned to glassy paste--
706,THE NOON OF NIGHT,"But he thanks God aloof from all distress,"
707,THE NOON OF NIGHT,For he knows sewers run beneath the city streets.

716,FIFTH AVENUE,"He winced a sigh, bowed to a spoiled deceit,"
717,FIFTH AVENUE,And donned the damask draperies of defeat
718,FIFTH AVENUE,To woo dishonour as an enterprise.
719,FIFTH AVENUE,His self-betrayal had its tenderness
720,FIFTH AVENUE,"And reared an outland refuge for his pride,"
721,FIFTH AVENUE,"For all were baffled telling how he lied,"
722,FIFTH AVENUE,Since more than any guessed he would confess.
723,FIFTH AVENUE,
724,FIFTH AVENUE,He died a hero in Fifth Avenue
725,FIFTH AVENUE,One yellowed day saving a tattered man.
726,FIFTH AVENUE,But in the litter of his passing breath
727,FIFTH AVENUE,A prayer lay lest one should misconstrue.
728,FIFTH AVENUE,It was an accident--and he began
729,FIFTH AVENUE,A last profound apology to death.
