391,GULLS,"Easter, it was--a beautiful day!--:"
392,GULLS,three gulls came from above the river
393,GULLS,and crossed slowly seaward!
394,GULLS,"Oh, I know you have your own hymns, I have heard them--"
395,GULLS,and because I knew they invoked some great protector
396,GULLS,"I could not be angry with you, no matter"
397,GULLS,how much they outraged true music--
398,GULLS,
399,GULLS,"You see, it is not necessary for us to leap at each other,"

610,TRACT,I will teach you   my townspeople
611,TRACT,how to perform   a funeral--
612,TRACT,for you have it   over a troop
613,TRACT,of artists--
614,TRACT,unless one should   scour the world--
615,TRACT,you have the ground sense   necessary.
616,TRACT,
617,TRACT,See!   the hearse leads.
618,TRACT,I begin with   a design for a hearse.
619,TRACT,For Christ’s sake   not black--
620,TRACT,nor white either--   and not polished!
621,TRACT,Let it be weathered--   like a farm wagon--
622,TRACT,with gilt wheels   (this could be
623,TRACT,applied fresh   at small expense)
624,TRACT,or no wheels at all:
625,TRACT,a rough dray to   drag over the ground.
626,TRACT,
627,TRACT,Knock the glass out!
628,TRACT,"My God--glass,   my townspeople!"
629,TRACT,For what purpose?   Is it for the dead
630,TRACT,to look out or   for us to see
631,TRACT,how well he is housed   or to see
632,TRACT,the flowers or   the lack of them--
633,TRACT,or what?
634,TRACT,To keep the rain   and snow from him?
635,TRACT,He will have a   heavier rain soon:
636,TRACT,pebbles and dirt   and what not.
637,TRACT,Let there be no glass--
638,TRACT,and no upholstery   phew!
639,TRACT,and no little   brass rollers
640,TRACT,and small easy wheels   on the bottom--
641,TRACT,my townspeople   what are you thinking of?
642,TRACT,
643,TRACT,A rough    plain hearse then
644,TRACT,with gilt wheels   and no top at all.
645,TRACT,On this   the coffin lies
646,TRACT,by its own weight.
647,TRACT,
648,TRACT,No wreathes please--
649,TRACT,especially no   hot house flowers.
650,TRACT,"Some common memento   is better,"
651,TRACT,something he prized   and is known by:
652,TRACT,his old clothes--   a few books perhaps--
653,TRACT,God knows what!   You realize
654,TRACT,how we are   about these things
655,TRACT,my townspeople--
656,TRACT,something will be found--   anything
657,TRACT,even flowers   if he had come to that.
658,TRACT,
659,TRACT,So much for   the hearse.
660,TRACT,For heaven’s sake though   see to the driver!
661,TRACT,
662,TRACT,Take off   the silk hat! In fact
663,TRACT,that’s no place   at all for him--
664,TRACT,up there   unceremoniously
665,TRACT,dragging our friend out   to his own dignity!
666,TRACT,Bring him down--   bring him down!
667,TRACT,Low and inconspicuous!   I’d not have him ride
668,TRACT,on the wagon at all--   damn him--
669,TRACT,the undertaker’s   understrapper!
670,TRACT,Let him hold the reins
671,TRACT,and walk at   the side
672,TRACT,and inconspicuously   too!
673,TRACT,
674,TRACT,Then briefly   as to yourselves:
675,TRACT,"Walk behind--   as they do in France,"
676,TRACT,"seventh class, or   if you ride"
677,TRACT,Hell take curtains!   Go with some show
678,TRACT,of inconvenience;   sit openly--
679,TRACT,to the weather   as to grief.
680,TRACT,Or do you think   you can shut grief in?
681,TRACT,What--from us?   We who have perhaps
682,TRACT,nothing to lose?   Share with us
683,TRACT,share with us--   it will be money

2094,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,--especially in April!
2095,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,Curl up round their shoes
2096,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,"when they try to step on you,"
2097,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,spoil the polish!
2098,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,I shall laugh till I am sick
2099,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,at their amazement.
2100,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,Do they expect the ground to be
2101,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,always solid?
2102,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,Give them the slip then;
2103,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,let them sit in you;
2104,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,soil their pants;
2105,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,teach them a dignity
2106,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,"that is dignity, the dignity"
2107,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,of mud!
2108,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,
2109,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,
2110,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,Lie basking in
2111,DEDICATION FOR A PLOT OF GROUND,the sun then--fast asleep!

2120,LOVE SONG,I lie here thinking of you:--
2121,LOVE SONG,
2122,LOVE SONG,the stain of love
2123,LOVE SONG,is upon the world!
2124,LOVE SONG,"Yellow, yellow, yellow"
2125,LOVE SONG,"it eats into the leaves,"
2126,LOVE SONG,smears with saffron
2127,LOVE SONG,the horned branches that lean
2128,LOVE SONG,heavily
2129,LOVE SONG,against a smooth purple sky!
2130,LOVE SONG,There is no light
2131,LOVE SONG,only a honey-thick stain
2132,LOVE SONG,that drips from leaf to leaf
2133,LOVE SONG,and limb to limb
2134,LOVE SONG,spoiling the colors

2148,ADVENT,ADVENT
2149,ADVENT,
2150,ADVENT,Even in the time when as yet
2151,ADVENT,I had no certain knowledge of her
2152,ADVENT,"She sprang from the nest, a young crow,"
2153,ADVENT,Whose first flight circled the forest.
2154,ADVENT,I know now how then she showed me
2155,ADVENT,"Her mind, reaching out to the horizon,"
2156,ADVENT,She close above the tree tops.
2157,ADVENT,I saw her eyes straining at the new distance
2158,ADVENT,And as the woods fell from her flying
2159,ADVENT,Likewise they fell from me as I followed--
2160,ADVENT,So that I strongly guessed all that I must put from me
2161,ADVENT,To come through ready for the high courses.
2162,ADVENT,
2163,ADVENT,"But one day, crossing the ferry"
2164,ADVENT,"With the great towers of Manhattan before me,"
2165,ADVENT,"Out at the prow with the sea wind blowing,"
2166,ADVENT,I had been wearying many questions
2167,ADVENT,Which she had put on to try me:
2168,ADVENT,How shall I be a mirror to this modernity?
2169,ADVENT,"When lo! in a rush, dragging"
2170,ADVENT,A blunt boat on the yielding river--
2171,ADVENT,Suddenly I saw her! And she waved me
2172,ADVENT,From the white wet in midst of her playing!
2173,ADVENT,"She cried me, “Haia! Here I am, son!"
2174,ADVENT,See how strong my little finger is!
2175,ADVENT,Can I not swim well?
2176,ADVENT,I can fly too!” And with that a great sea-gull
2177,ADVENT,"Went to the left, vanishing with a wild cry--"
2178,ADVENT,But in my mind all the persons of godhead
2179,ADVENT,Followed after.
2180,ADVENT,

2182,CLARITY,CLARITY
2183,CLARITY,
2184,CLARITY,“Come!” cried my mind and by her might
2185,CLARITY,That was upon us we flew above the river
2186,CLARITY,"Seeking her, grey gulls among the white--"
2187,CLARITY,In the air speaking as she had willed it:
2188,CLARITY,"“I am given,” cried I, “now I know it!"
2189,CLARITY,I know now all my time is forespent!
2190,CLARITY,For me one face is all the world!
2191,CLARITY,"For I have seen her at last, this day,"
2192,CLARITY,In whom age in age is united--
2193,CLARITY,"Indifferent, out of sequence, marvelously!"
2194,CLARITY,Saving alone that one sequence
2195,CLARITY,"Which is the beauty of all the world, for surely"
2196,CLARITY,Either there in the rolling smoke spheres below us
2197,CLARITY,"Or here with us in the air intercircling,"
2198,CLARITY,Certainly somewhere here about us
2199,CLARITY,I know she is revealing these things!”
2200,CLARITY,
2201,CLARITY,And as gulls we flew and with soft cries
2202,CLARITY,"We seemed to speak, flying, “It is she"
2203,CLARITY,"The mighty, recreating the whole world,"
2204,CLARITY,This the first day of wonders!
2205,CLARITY,She is attiring herself before me--
2206,CLARITY,"Taking shape before me for worship,"
2207,CLARITY,A red leaf that falls upon a stone!
2208,CLARITY,"It is she of whom I told you, old"
2209,CLARITY,"Forgiveless, unreconcilable;"
2210,CLARITY,That high wanderer of by-ways
2211,CLARITY,Walking imperious in beggary!
2212,CLARITY,"At her throat is loose gold, a single chain"
2213,CLARITY,"From among many, on her bent fingers"
2214,CLARITY,"Are rings from which the stones are fallen,"
2215,CLARITY,"Her wrists wear a diminished state, her ankles"
2216,CLARITY,Are bare! Toward the river! Is it she there?”
2217,CLARITY,And we swerved clamorously downward--
2218,CLARITY,“I will take my peace in her henceforth!”
2219,CLARITY,
2220,CLARITY,
2221,BROADWAY,BROADWAY
2222,BROADWAY,
2223,BROADWAY,"It was then she struck--from behind,"
2224,BROADWAY,"In mid air, as with the edge of a great wing!"
2225,BROADWAY,And instantly down the mists of my eyes
2226,BROADWAY,There came crowds walking--- men as visions
2227,BROADWAY,"With expressionless, animate faces;"
2228,BROADWAY,Empty men with shell-thin bodies
2229,BROADWAY,"Jostling close above the gutter,"
2230,BROADWAY,Hasting--nowhere! And then for the first time
2231,BROADWAY,"I really saw her, really scented the sweat"
2232,BROADWAY,Of her presence and--fell back sickened!
2233,BROADWAY,"Ominous, old, painted--"
2234,BROADWAY,"With bright lips, and lewd Jew’s eyes"
2235,BROADWAY,Her might strapped in by a corset
2236,BROADWAY,"To give her age youth, perfect"
2237,BROADWAY,In her will to be young she had covered
2238,BROADWAY,The godhead to go beside me.
2239,BROADWAY,"Silent, her voice entered at my eyes"
2240,BROADWAY,And my astonished thought followed her easily:
2241,BROADWAY,"“Well, do their eyes shine, do their clothes fit?"
2242,BROADWAY,"These _live_ I tell you! Old men with red cheeks,"
2243,BROADWAY,Young men in gay suits! See them!
2244,BROADWAY,"Dogged, quivering, impassive--"
2245,BROADWAY,Well--are these the ones you envied?”
2246,BROADWAY,"At which I answered her, “Marvelous old queen,"
2247,BROADWAY,Grant me power to catch something of this day’s
2248,BROADWAY,Air and sun into your service!
2249,BROADWAY,That these toilers after peace and after pleasure
2250,BROADWAY,"May turn to you, worshippers at all hours!”"
2251,BROADWAY,But she sniffed upon the words warily--
2252,BROADWAY,"Yet I persisted, watching for an answer:"
2253,BROADWAY,"“To you, horrible old woman,"
2254,BROADWAY,Who know all fires out of the bodies
2255,BROADWAY,Of all men that walk with lust at heart!
2256,BROADWAY,"To you, O mighty, crafty prowler"
2257,BROADWAY,"After the youth of all cities, drunk"
2258,BROADWAY,With the sight of thy archness! All the youth
2259,BROADWAY,"That come to you, you having the knowledge"
2260,BROADWAY,Rather than to those uninitiate--
2261,BROADWAY,"To you, marvelous old queen, give me always"
2262,BROADWAY,A new marriage--”
2263,BROADWAY,But she laughed loudly--
2264,BROADWAY,“A new grip upon those garments that brushed me
2265,BROADWAY,"In days gone by on beach, lawn, and in forest!"
2266,BROADWAY,"May I be lifted still, up and out of terror,"
2267,BROADWAY,Up from before the death living around me--
2268,BROADWAY,Tom up continually and carried
2269,BROADWAY,"Whatever way the head of your whim is,"
2270,BROADWAY,A burr upon those streaming tatters--”
2271,BROADWAY,"But the night had fallen, she stilled me"
2272,BROADWAY,And led me away.

2275,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,PATERSON--THE STRIKE
2276,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2277,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,At the first peep of dawn she roused me!
2278,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,I rose trembling at the change which the night saw!
2279,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"For there, wretchedly brooding in a corner"
2280,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,From which her old eyes glittered fiercely--
2281,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“Go!” she said, and I hurried shivering"
2282,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Out into the deserted streets of Paterson.
2283,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2284,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"That night she came again, hovering"
2285,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,In rags within the filmy ceiling--
2286,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“Great Queen, bless me with thy tatters!”"
2287,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“You are blest, go on!”"
2288,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“Hot for savagery,"
2289,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Sucking the air! I went into the city,"
2290,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Out again, baffled onto the mountain!"
2291,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Back into the city!
2292,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Nowhere
2293,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,The subtle! Everywhere the electric!”
2294,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2295,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,“A short bread-line before a hitherto empty tea shop:
2296,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"No questions--all stood patiently,"
2297,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Dominated by one idea: something
2298,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"That carried them as they are always wanting to be carried,"
2299,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"‘But what is it,’ I asked those nearest me,"
2300,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,‘This thing heretofore unobtainable
2301,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,That they seem so clever to have put on now!’
2302,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2303,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,“Why since I have failed them can it be anything but their own brood?
2304,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Can it be anything but brutality?
2305,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,On that at least they’re united! That at least
2306,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Is their bean soup, their calm bread and a few luxuries!"
2307,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2308,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“But in me, more sensitive, marvelous old queen"
2309,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"It sank deep into the blood, that I rose upon"
2310,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,The tense air enjoying the dusty fight!
2311,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Heavy drink were the low, sloping foreheads"
2312,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"The flat skulls with the unkempt black or blond hair,"
2313,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"The ugly legs of the young girls, pistons"
2314,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Too powerful for delicacy!
2315,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"The women’s wrists, the men’s arms, red"
2316,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Used to heat and cold, to toss quartered beeves"
2317,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"And barrels, and milk-cans, and crates of fruit!"
2318,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2319,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“Faces all knotted up like burls on oaks,"
2320,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Grasping, fox-snouted, thick-lipped,"
2321,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Sagging breasts and protruding stomachs,"
2322,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"Rasping voices, filthy habits with the hands."
2323,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2324,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,“Nowhere you! Everywhere the electric!
2325,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2326,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“Ugly, venemous, gigantic!"
2327,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Tossing me as a great father his helpless
2328,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,Infant till it shriek with ecstasy
2329,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,And its eyes roll and its tongue hangs out!--
2330,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,
2331,PATERSON--THE STRIKE,"“I am at peace again, old queen, I listen clearer now.”"

2334,ABROAD,ABROAD
2335,ABROAD,
2336,ABROAD,"Never, even in a dream,"
2337,ABROAD,Have I winged so high nor so well
2338,ABROAD,"As with her, she leading me by the hand,"
2339,ABROAD,That first day on the Jersey mountains!
2340,ABROAD,And never shall I forget
2341,ABROAD,The trembling interest with which I heard
2342,ABROAD,Her voice in a low thunder:
2343,ABROAD,"“You are safe here. Look child, look open-mouth!"
2344,ABROAD,The patch of road between the steep bramble banks;
2345,ABROAD,"The tree in the wind, the white house there, the sky!"
2346,ABROAD,"Speak to men of these, concerning me!"
2347,ABROAD,For never while you permit them to ignore me
2348,ABROAD,In these shall the full of my freed voice
2349,ABROAD,Come grappling the ear with intent!
2350,ABROAD,Never while the air’s clear coolness
2351,ABROAD,Is seized to be a coat for pettiness;
2352,ABROAD,Never while richness of greenery
2353,ABROAD,Stands a shield for prurient minds;
2354,ABROAD,"Never, permitting these things unchallenged"
2355,ABROAD,Shall my voice of leaves and varicolored bark come free through!”
2356,ABROAD,"At which, knowing her solitude,"
2357,ABROAD,I shouted over the country below me:
2358,ABROAD,"“Waken! my people, to the boughs green"
2359,ABROAD,With ripening fruit within you!
2360,ABROAD,Waken to the myriad cinquefoil
2361,ABROAD,In the waving grass of your minds!
2362,ABROAD,Waken to the silent phoebe nest
2363,ABROAD,Under the eaves of your spirit!”
2364,ABROAD,
2365,ABROAD,"But she, stooping nearer the shifting hills"
2366,ABROAD,Spoke again. “Look there! See them!
2367,ABROAD,"There in the oat field with the horses,"
2368,ABROAD,See them there! bowed by their passions
2369,ABROAD,"Crushed down, that had been raised as a roof beam!"
2370,ABROAD,The weight of the sky is upon them
2371,ABROAD,Under which all roof beams crumble.
2372,ABROAD,There is none but the single roof beam:
2373,ABROAD,There is no love bears against the great firefly!
2374,ABROAD,At this I looked up at the sun
2375,ABROAD,Then shouted again with all the might I had.
2376,ABROAD,But my voice was a seed in the wind.
2377,ABROAD,"Then she, the old one, laughing"
2378,ABROAD,Seized me and whirling about bore back
2379,ABROAD,"To the city, upward, still laughing"
2380,ABROAD,Until the great towers stood above the marshland
2381,ABROAD,"Wheeling beneath: the little creeks, the mallows"
2382,ABROAD,"That I picked as a boy, the Hackensack"
2383,ABROAD,So quiet that seemed so broad formerly:
2384,ABROAD,"The crawling trains, the cedar swamp on the one side--"
2385,ABROAD,"All so old, so familiar--so new now"
2386,ABROAD,To my marvelling eyes as we passed
2387,ABROAD,Invisible.

2390,SOOTHSAY,SOOTHSAY
2391,SOOTHSAY,
2392,SOOTHSAY,"Eight days went by, eight days"
2393,SOOTHSAY,"Comforted by no nights, until finally:"
2394,SOOTHSAY,"“Would you behold yourself old, beloved?”"
2395,SOOTHSAY,"I was pierced, yet I consented gladly"
2396,SOOTHSAY,For I knew it could not be otherwise.
2397,SOOTHSAY,And she--“Behold yourself old!
2398,SOOTHSAY,"Sustained in strength, wielding might in gript surges!"
2399,SOOTHSAY,Not bodying the sun in weak leaps
2400,SOOTHSAY,But holding way over rockish men
2401,SOOTHSAY,"With fern free fingers on their little crags,"
2402,SOOTHSAY,"Their hollows, the new Atlas, to bear them"
2403,SOOTHSAY,For pride and for mockery! Behold
2404,SOOTHSAY,Yourself old! winding with slow might--
2405,SOOTHSAY,A vine among oaks--to the thin tops:
2406,SOOTHSAY,"Leaving the leafless leaved,"
2407,SOOTHSAY,Bearing purple clusters! Behold
2408,SOOTHSAY,Yourself old! birds are behind you.
2409,SOOTHSAY,"You are the wind coming that stills birds,"
2410,SOOTHSAY,Shakes the leaves in booming polyphony--
2411,SOOTHSAY,"Slow, winning high way amid the knocking"
2412,SOOTHSAY,"Of boughs, evenly crescendo,"
2413,SOOTHSAY,The din and bellow of the male wind!
2414,SOOTHSAY,Leap then from forest into foam!
2415,SOOTHSAY,Lash about from low into high flames
2416,SOOTHSAY,"Tipping sound, the female chorus--"
2417,SOOTHSAY,"Linking all lions, all twitterings"
2418,SOOTHSAY,To make them nothing! Behold yourself old!”
2419,SOOTHSAY,"As I made to answer she continued,"
2420,SOOTHSAY,A little wistfully yet in a voice clear cut:
2421,SOOTHSAY,“Good is my over lip and evil
2422,SOOTHSAY,My underlip to you henceforth:
2423,SOOTHSAY,For I have taken your soul between my two hands
2424,SOOTHSAY,And this shall be as it is spoken.”

2427,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,ST. JAMES’ GROVE
2428,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,
2429,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And so it came to that last day
2430,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"When, she leading by the hand, we went out"
2431,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Early in the morning, I heavy of heart"
2432,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,For I knew the novitiate was ended
2433,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"The ecstasy was over, the life begun."
2434,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,
2435,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,In my woolen shirt and the pale blue necktie
2436,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"My grandmother gave me, there I went"
2437,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,With the old queen right past the houses
2438,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Of my friends down the hill to the river
2439,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"As on any usual day, any errand."
2440,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Alone, walking under trees,"
2441,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"I went with her, she with me in her wild hair,"
2442,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,By Santiago Grove and presently
2443,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"She bent forward and knelt by the river,"
2444,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"The Passaic, that filthy river."
2445,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"And there dabbling her mad hands,"
2446,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,She called me close beside her.
2447,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Raising the water then in the cupped palm
2448,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,She bathed our brows wailing and laughing:
2449,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"“River, we are old, you and I,"
2450,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"We are old and by bad luck, beggars."
2451,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Lo, the filth in our hair, our bodies stink!"
2452,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Old friend, here I have brought you"
2453,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,The young soul you long asked of me.
2454,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Stand forth, river, and give me"
2455,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,The old friend of my revels!
2456,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Give me the well-worn spirit,"
2457,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"For here I have made a room for it,"
2458,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And I will return to you forthwith
2459,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,The youth you have long asked of me:
2460,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Stand forth, river, and give me"
2461,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,The old friend of my revels!”
2462,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,
2463,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And the filthy Passaic consented!
2464,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,
2465,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Then she, leaping up with a fierce cry:"
2466,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"“Enter, youth, into this bulk!"
2467,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Enter, river, into this young man!”"
2468,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Then the river began to enter my heart,"
2469,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Eddying back cool and limpid
2470,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Into the crystal beginning of its days.
2471,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,But with the rebound it leaped forward:
2472,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Muddy, then black and shrunken"
2473,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Till I felt the utter depth of its rottenness
2474,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,The vile breadth of its degradation
2475,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And dropped down knowing this was me now.
2476,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,But she lifted me and the water took a new tide
2477,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Again into the older experiences,"
2478,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"And so, backward and forward,"
2479,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,It tortured itself within me
2480,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"Until time had been washed finally under,"
2481,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And the river had found its level
2482,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And its last motion had ceased
2483,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And I knew all--it became me.
2484,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And I knew this for double certain
2485,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,"For there, whitely, I saw myself"
2486,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Being borne off under the water!
2487,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,I could have shouted out in my agony
2488,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,At the sight of myself departing
2489,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,Forever--but I bit back my despair
2490,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,For she had averted her eyes
2491,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,By which I knew well what she was thinking--
2492,ST. JAMES’ GROVE,And so the last of me was taken.
