70,A FOREWORD,
71,A FOREWORD,
72,A FOREWORD,It is hard for me to realize that this is a first volume of verse. Most
73,A FOREWORD,of the initial ventures that have passed under my jaundiced eye have
74,A FOREWORD,been precisely what such early collections are expected to be. They
75,A FOREWORD,"were, as Wilde expressed it somewhere, “promissory notes--that are never"
76,A FOREWORD,met.”... But though it is hard for me to believe that this is a first
77,A FOREWORD,"book, it is still harder for me to believe that this is Maxwell"
78,A FOREWORD,Bodenheim’s first book. In these days of the much advertised “poetic
79,A FOREWORD,"renaissance,” when the _Dial_ out-radicals the _Little Review_, and even"
80,A FOREWORD,"the New York _Tribune_ prints _vers-libre_ on its editorial page, I"
81,A FOREWORD,expected to see nothing less than Bodenheim’s Collected works.... This
82,A FOREWORD,"pleasure will evidently have to be deferred.... Meanwhile, here is an"
83,A FOREWORD,"indication, and no slight one, of how distinguished and decorative that"
84,A FOREWORD,"collection will be. Without Kreymborg’s caustic and acerb irony, or"
85,A FOREWORD,"Johns’ fluent lyricism, Bodenheim has something that neither they nor,"
86,A FOREWORD,"for that matter, any of his colleagues in “_Others_” possess. I refer to"
87,A FOREWORD,"his extreme sensitivity to words. Words, under his hands, have"
88,A FOREWORD,unexpected growths; placid nouns and sober adjectives bear fantastic
89,A FOREWORD,fruit. It is a strange and often magic potion he brews from them; dark
90,A FOREWORD,and fiery liquids that he pours into curiously designed cups. Sometimes
91,A FOREWORD,"he gets drunk with his own distillation, and reels between preciosity"
92,A FOREWORD,and incoherence. Sometimes the mixture is so strong that even his
93,A FOREWORD,"metaphors, crowding about each other, become inextricably mixed. But as"
94,A FOREWORD,"a rule, Bodenheim is as clear-headed as he is colorful. Among the"
95,A FOREWORD,younger men he has no superior in his use of the verbal _nuance_.
96,A FOREWORD,
97,A FOREWORD,But it is not merely as word-juggler that Bodenheim shines. He has an
98,A FOREWORD,"imagination that he uses both as a tool and as a toy. Personally, I care"
99,A FOREWORD,more for Bodenheim when he plays with his images (as in “Poet to His
100,A FOREWORD,"Love,” “Hill Side Tree” and certain of the poems to “Minna”), than when"
101,A FOREWORD,"his figures attempt to build or destroy something (as in “To An Enemy,”"
102,A FOREWORD,"“The Interne,” “Soldiers”). It is as a decorator that his gifts serve"
103,A FOREWORD,him best. Even such an intimate picture as “Factory Girl” is saved from
104,A FOREWORD,mawkishness by his delicate sense of design. The composition in which
105,A FOREWORD,Death is seen as
106,A FOREWORD,
107,A FOREWORD,“...a black slave with little silver birds
108,A FOREWORD,Perched in a sleeping wreath upon his head”
109,A FOREWORD,
110,A FOREWORD,has a quality that suggests the Beardsley of “Under the Hill.” In the
111,A FOREWORD,"realm of the whimsical-grotesque, Bodenheim walks with a light but sure"
112,A FOREWORD,footstep.
113,A FOREWORD,
114,A FOREWORD,There are doubtless other things--sharper and more important--in the
115,A FOREWORD,following poems that will attract many. But the ones that I have found
116,A FOREWORD,"seem to have a quiet, unofficial, dignity of their own. Others may ask"
117,A FOREWORD,"for more. For me, they are sufficient."

127,I,I
128,I,
129,I,Twilight pushes down your eyes
130,I,"With shimmering, pregnant fingers"
131,I,That leave you covered with still-born touch.
132,I,With little whips of dead words
133,I,Silence cuts your lips to a keener red.
134,I,"Your heart strikes its bed of dark mirth, in death,"
135,I,"And your hands lie over it, guarding the corpse."
136,I,Night will soon whisk away this room
137,I,But you are already invisible.
138,I,
139,I,
140,II,II
141,II,
142,II,Your cheeks are spent diminuendos
143,II,Sheering into the rose-veiled silence of your lips.
144,II,Your eyes are gossamer coquettes
145,II,Ringed with the sparkling breath of dead loves.
146,II,Your body strays into lanterns of form
147,II,Strewing the night within this room....
148,II,The light dies; you are still
149,II,And spill the frolicing night of your heart
150,II,"Over the darkness about you, making it pale."
151,II,
152,II,
153,III,III
154,III,
155,III,Your criss-crossed ringlets of hair
156,III,Are tipped with faltering opalescence.
157,III,At dawn a lost smile ever returns
158,III,And hides in your hair because he fears
159,III,The solemn marble profile of your face.
160,III,His presence caresses your lips to wings of color
161,III,That beat against each other and release
162,III,"Dulcet, feathery tinges of love descending to your heart."
163,III,"And thus, each morning, your rising heart"
164,III,Wears a new bridal robe.
165,III,
166,III,
167,IV,IV
168,IV,
169,IV,"Moonlight bends over black silence,"
170,IV,Making it bloom to wild-flowers of sound
171,IV,That only green things can hear.
172,IV,"A wind sprawls over an orchard,"
173,IV,Frightening its silent litany to sound.
174,IV,A thread of star-light has fallen to this tree
175,IV,"And curls among its leaves, tangling them to silence...."
176,IV,"Standing amidst these things, Beloved,"
177,IV,We feel the words our hearts cannot form.
178,IV,
179,IV,
180,V,V
181,V,
182,V,Pain is a country cousin of yours.
183,V,He flings buds of awakening desires
184,V,"Upon the stately weddings in your heart,"
185,V,And laughs.
186,V,You must teach him better manners;
187,V,Bind his mouth with pale sleep;
188,V,Caress him with trailing hands
189,V,"That loosen the buds he has stolen, into flowers."
190,V,
191,V,
192,VI,VI
193,VI,
194,VI,We met upon nearby hill-tops of our lives
195,VI,"And shook the dust from us, revealing flame-laced clothes"
196,VI,And eyeing each other in the same moment.
197,VI,You curved a longing to the wave of your arm:
198,VI,A longing for dark rest crossed by unbidden gifts.
199,VI,And my eyes deepened in answer....
200,VI,Then we floated down to the valley between us:
201,VI,The valley ringed with smooth honey-combs of sleep.
202,VI,
203,VI,
204,VII,VII
205,VII,
206,VII,You have a morning-glory face
207,VII,Whose edges are sensitive to light
208,VII,And curl in beneath the burden of a smile.
209,VII,Remembered silence returns to the morning-glory
210,VII,And lattices its curves
211,VII,With shades of golden reverberations.
212,VII,Then the morning-glory’s heart careens to loves
213,VII,Whose scent beats on the sky-walls of your soul.
214,VII,
215,VII,
216,VIII,VIII
217,VIII,
218,VIII,"You draw my heart about you, as a cloak,"
219,VIII,And your words steal over it like a reluctant color:
220,VIII,A color of pain that fears to die.
221,VIII,My heart ripples with your slight turning
222,VIII,"But sometimes moves when you are still,"
223,VIII,Beckoning to longings that have not reached your mouth.
224,VIII,
225,VIII,
226,IX,IX
227,IX,
228,IX,"Sedate and archaic, a twilight-frilled haze"
229,IX,Walks over the meadows like rolled-out centuries
230,IX,Quivering in sprightly welcome.
231,IX,Trees pushed down by silence;
232,IX,Trees lolling in comely abandon;
233,IX,"Trees pungently flamboyant,"
234,IX,Their leaves spinning in the wind’s golden elusiveness.
235,IX,Trees probing the shrilly sensitive sunset
236,IX,"Like little, laced nightmares leaning"
237,IX,Upon a scarlet breast;
238,IX,Trees sprinkling their stifled mockery
239,IX,Upon the blue tomb of the air;
240,IX,"Trees, are you silenced beings"
241,IX,Whitening into the winding paradise
242,IX,Of old loves seeking a second death?
243,IX,"And has this archaic, twilight-frilled haze"
244,IX,Moulded me to your semblance?
245,IX,
246,IX,
247,X,X
248,X,
249,X,The wrinkled grimaces of eastern skies
250,X,Are caught on the Chinese mirrors of your eyes
251,X,"And lie, pallid and benign."
252,X,Your mouth is a senile dragon
253,X,Spitting fire-fly words from its vermillion shroud.
254,X,Your cheeks are shrunken silences of Gods
255,X,Paling out upon ivoried Nirvanas of silk.
256,X,Your face holds fugitive bits of your heart
257,X,That wandered away and returned to rest.
258,X,
259,X,
260,XI,XI
261,XI,
262,XI,"Your body was puzzling, like a half-made figure"
263,XI,Till the final shaping of your voice came
264,XI,And riotous secrets of lines curved out
265,XI,And trembled upon your limbs.
266,XI,Then silence touched your body to motion:
267,XI,Your limbs released fleeing andantes of pain
268,XI,And your heart flung little crescents of budding caresses
269,XI,Into the waiting hunger of your eyes.
270,XI,
271,XI,
272,XII,XII
273,XII,
274,XII,You are a well sprayed with cool rubies of sound
275,XII,In which I bathe and rise with another skin
276,XII,Like moon-stone passion slyly courting
277,XII,The light breath of a tired dream.
278,XII,I drop my heart into the depths
279,XII,"Of your disheveled serenity,"
280,XII,And stroll off empty.
281,XII,When my heart has merged to your shades of pearl quietness
282,XII,I return and once more drop within you.
283,XII,
284,XII,
285,XIII,XIII
286,XIII,
287,XIII,The mellow anger of his hair
288,XIII,Disputes his sleepy girl’s face.
289,XIII,His robe glows like a painted wound
290,XIII,Upon the bent meditation of his body.
291,XIII,His hands are so thin that silence bruises them:
292,XIII,Thin from the pressure brought by endless prayers...
293,XIII,When you were with me I did not know
294,XIII,That your voice was pouring him out in molten colors
295,XIII,To be shaped by the fingers of my memory--
296,XIII,This prince-made-of-many-deal-loves.
297,XIII,
298,XIII,
299,XIV,XIV
300,XIV,
301,XIV,"Sometimes jaded, sometimes tranquil,"
302,XIV,Your eyes invade the tumult of your face.
303,XIV,Your lips are the remnants of a love
304,XIV,That made a sunset-cup of your face.
305,XIV,The movements of your body
306,XIV,Caress the couch you sit on into sound
307,XIV,That seems to answer your words.
308,XIV,You are restless because upon this couch
309,XIV,The cold touch of your lover lies
310,XIV,"And seeps into you, reaching your heart."
311,XIV,
312,XIV,
313,XV,XV
314,XV,
315,XV,"Your arms, in faltering crescendos,"
316,XV,Wander through the room
317,XV,Tinted with expectation of night.
318,XV,The room seems a tottering tomb
319,XV,Through which you roam with hands
320,XV,Striving to press each form into the shape
321,XV,Of someone buried beneath you....
322,XV,Only when night sprays the room with his breath
323,XV,Do you change to that which you seek.
324,XV,
325,XV,
326,XVI,XVI
327,XVI,
328,XVI,"Two walls, dizzy with rain-touch"
329,XVI,"And suffused with gauzily amorous sunlight,"
330,XVI,Creep over a hill and meet.
331,XVI,And so our foreheads touch.
332,XVI,
333,XVI,Silence between our hands grows into clasped music
334,XVI,Sprinkling our finger-tips with attenuated chords of touch.
335,XVI,Our hearts weave low songs to this accompaniment:
336,XVI,So low that even silence cannot hear.
337,XVI,
338,XVI,
339,XVII,XVII
340,XVII,
341,XVII,"Afternoon sunlight limps tenuously away,"
342,XVII,Leaving a snarled retrospect of golden foot-marks.
343,XVII,The sea is pregnant with gracious discords
344,XVII,That falteringly shroud the sleep-rhythmed breasts of winds.
345,XVII,The sky is a genially vacant stare.
346,XVII,Remaining touches of starlight
347,XVII,Tremble the leaves when air is still....
348,XVII,"And so my love for you strolls through this day,"
349,XVII,Picking up forgotten hints of its heart.
350,XVII,

354,XVIII,_Maiden_
355,XVIII,
356,XVIII,My heart is a slovenly russet peasant-girl
357,XVIII,Flirting with staidly immaculate swains.
358,XVIII,
359,XVIII,_Youth_
360,XVIII,
361,XVIII,And mine is summer-rain
362,XVIII,Strewing itself in mirthful swirls
363,XVIII,Over the odorous pain of flowers
364,XVIII,That long to dance.
365,XVIII,
366,XVIII,_Maiden_
367,XVIII,
368,XVIII,"My heart will walk through yours,"
369,XVIII,Holding its crushed robe in both hands
370,XVIII,"And quieting, with gentle nakedness,"
371,XVIII,The mirthful rain and odorous pain in your heart.
372,XVIII,
373,XVIII,_Youth_
374,XVIII,
375,XVIII,When your heart leaves mine it will be an old woman
376,XVIII,With two of my shrunken flowers for her breasts.
377,XVIII,
378,XVIII,
379,XIX,XIX
380,XIX,
381,XIX,Your breast is the bridal-couch of our stillness.
382,XIX,The restless beggar of our breath
383,XIX,"Leaves the folding of stillness, reeling with gifts,"
384,XIX,With dreams in which we glimpse our own scars.
385,XIX,We give these reflections of scars to stillness
386,XIX,And she turns them into bitter hummingbirds
387,XIX,Offering us the colored death of song
388,XIX,Held out in her enticing hands.
389,XIX,
390,XIX,
391,XX,XX
392,XX,
393,XX,"Like prayers born dead, long shadows"
394,XX,"Strew the floor and clutch at your feet,"
395,XX,But buoyant with paint you walk to and fro.
396,XX,The room is garlanded with unseen eyes
397,XX,That you must evade lest they touch you into sight
398,XX,"And send you, naked, into the moonlight."
399,XX,
400,XX,
401,XXI,XXI
402,XXI,
403,XXI,Your body is a closed fan
404,XXI,Holding long brush-strokes of glowing repose.
405,XXI,Your words clumsily unloosen the fan
406,XXI,And it dips to the rustling birth of forgotten doubts.
407,XXI,Your soul bears the fan lightly in his hand
408,XXI,And waves to the mirror his blind eyes cannot touch.
409,XXI,
410,XXI,
411,XXII,XXII
412,XXII,
413,XXII,The gown you wear is curiously like sound--
414,XXII,Tangles of dahlia-murmurs taking shape
415,XXII,"In shrinking, mellow sprays."
416,XXII,The everlasting journey of your heart
417,XXII,Gliding over a sleepy litany
418,XXII,That winds through scattered star-flowers of regrets:
419,XXII,The everlasting journey of your heart
420,XXII,Is like a fragile traveler of sound--
421,XXII,A murmur seeking the love that gave it birth.
422,XXII,
423,XXII,
424,XXIII,XXIII
425,XXIII,
426,XXIII,"Whenever a love dies within you,"
427,XXIII,"Griefs, phosphorescent with unborn tears,"
428,XXIII,Cut the glowing hush of a meadow within you:
429,XXIII,Griefs striking their pearl-voiced cymbals
430,XXIII,And shaping the silences once held by your love.
431,XXIII,Your new love blows a trumpet of sunlight
432,XXIII,"Into the meadow, and your griefs"
433,XXIII,Leap into the echo and return to you.
434,XXIII,
435,XXIII,
436,XXIV,XXIV
437,XXIV,
438,XXIV,We blew a luminous confusion of thoughts
439,XXIV,"Upon the silence of our souls,"
440,XXIV,"Staining it to little, weeping tints."
441,XXIV,Our hands pressed serpentine pain into each other
442,XXIV,And stroked it away to twilights of relief.
443,XXIV,"Our lips shook before the tread of coming words,"
444,XXIV,"But closed again, finding no need for them."
445,XXIV,
446,XXIV,
447,XXV,XXV
448,XXV,
449,XXV,Upon an arched sarcophagus of pain
450,XXV,Are figures painted in arrested embraces
451,XXV,With outlines so light that we must bend close to see:
452,XXV,Old loves almost merging to one tone
453,XXV,Of pale regret that holds
454,XXV,An inner glow of dead weeping.
455,XXV,Our lips cling and our breath winds to a hand
456,XXV,With touch like summer rain
457,XXV,Blending the arrested figures upon the arched sarcophagus of pain.
458,XXV,
459,XXV,
460,XXVI,XXVI
461,XXVI,
462,XXVI,"Make of your voice, a dawn"
463,XXVI,"Dropping little gestures upon my forehead,"
464,XXVI,While slumber-edged thoughts rise in my head
465,XXVI,And wave back greetings droll and confused.
466,XXVI,Pain has jested with the whirling night
467,XXVI,"And both vanish like an untold prayer,"
468,XXVI,"So, make of your voice, a dawn"
469,XXVI,Dropping little gestures upon my forehead.
470,XXVI,
471,XXVI,
472,XXVII,XXVII
473,XXVII,
474,XXVII,"Your mind is a little, clandestine pastel"
475,XXVII,Shaped into a posture of rigid grief.
476,XXVII,Its colors huddle together
477,XXVII,"And make a stunted, aching lyric...."
478,XXVII,Ah frail-flowered moment preceding reality--
479,XXVII,Your eyelids open; the little pastel dies.

493,POET TO HIS LOVE,Is my love for you.
494,POET TO HIS LOVE,The trees around it
495,POET TO HIS LOVE,Are words that I have stolen from your heart.
496,POET TO HIS LOVE,"An old silver bell, the last smile you gave,"
497,POET TO HIS LOVE,Hangs at the top of my church.
498,POET TO HIS LOVE,It rings only when you come through the forest
499,POET TO HIS LOVE,And stand beside it.

512,DEATH,For Death is a black slave with little silver birds
513,DEATH,Perched in a sleeping wreath upon his head.
514,DEATH,"He will tell me, his voice like jewels"
515,DEATH,"Dropped into a satin bag,"
516,DEATH,"How he has tip-toed after me down the road,"
517,DEATH,His heart made a dark whirlpool with longing for me.
518,DEATH,Then he will graze me with his hands

520,DEATH,"Between the cold waves of his hair, as he tip-toes on."

526,TO GEORGIE MAY,
527,TO GEORGIE MAY,
528,TO GEORGIE MAY,The ruins of your face were twined with youth.
529,TO GEORGIE MAY,Vines of starlight questioned your face when you smiled.
530,TO GEORGIE MAY,Your eyes dissolved over distances

1020,PEOPLE,"But master, those cringing writhings, those indelicate squirmings"
1021,PEOPLE,and jocund acrobatics which our most fastidious poisons
1022,PEOPLE,produce--what more tender satisfaction!
1023,PEOPLE,
1024,PEOPLE,Sobe (_listlessly_)
1025,PEOPLE,
1026,PEOPLE,"They are but interludes leaving me languidly envious of death, my"
1027,PEOPLE,master.
1028,PEOPLE,
1029,PEOPLE,Maldor (_speaks with indignation_)
1030,PEOPLE,
1031,PEOPLE,You have no master! Your last poison of moth-blood produced an
1032,PEOPLE,"effect so exquisitely monstrous that even death was appalled. Ah,"
1033,PEOPLE,"the bones of an old woman, dissolving within her, left her body, a"
1034,PEOPLE,loose grimace.
1035,PEOPLE,
1036,PEOPLE,Sobe
1037,PEOPLE,
1038,PEOPLE,I am sick of all these sterile grimaces.
1039,PEOPLE,
1040,PEOPLE,Maldor (_speaks slowly_)
1041,PEOPLE,
1042,PEOPLE,Some new and lethal poem has sighed itself into your heart.
1043,PEOPLE,
1044,PEOPLE,Sobe (_softly_)
1045,PEOPLE,
1046,PEOPLE,There are no poisons remaining. We have signalled death with many
1047,PEOPLE,diverting gestures. We have fitted too many clownish shrouds.
1048,PEOPLE,
1049,PEOPLE,Maldor
1050,PEOPLE,
1051,PEOPLE,You are wistfully nervous. Some dream has burned your heart to an
1052,PEOPLE,ashen bag.
1053,PEOPLE,
1054,PEOPLE,Sobe
1055,PEOPLE,
1056,PEOPLE,"I will tell you, Maldor, what I have done."
1057,PEOPLE,
1058,PEOPLE,Maldor
1059,PEOPLE,
1060,PEOPLE,"Surely, you have found no last contortion for life."
1061,PEOPLE,
1062,PEOPLE,Sobe
1063,PEOPLE,
1064,PEOPLE,I have found the ultimate contortion.
1065,PEOPLE,
1066,PEOPLE,Maldor
1067,PEOPLE,
1068,PEOPLE,Some nibbling horror....
1069,PEOPLE,
1070,PEOPLE,Sobe
1071,PEOPLE,
1072,PEOPLE,"No, Beauty."
1073,PEOPLE,
1074,PEOPLE,Maldor (_after a pause_)
1075,PEOPLE,
1076,PEOPLE,"Beware, master, beauty is life’s revenge upon death."
1077,PEOPLE,
1078,PEOPLE,Sobe
1079,PEOPLE,
1080,PEOPLE,You know very little. Beauty is the devourer of death.
1081,PEOPLE,
1082,PEOPLE,Maldor (_speaks slowly_)
1083,PEOPLE,
1084,PEOPLE,What poison is this?
1085,PEOPLE,
1086,PEOPLE,Sobe (_speaks gently_)
1087,PEOPLE,
1088,PEOPLE,"A drop taken into the blood, no more. The skin becomes a"
1089,PEOPLE,"milk-tinted pond in which wine-ghosts timidly bathe. The eyes, like"
1090,PEOPLE,"purple breasted birds, beat against the day. The mouth blooms into"
1091,PEOPLE,"splendours. Ah, Maldor, the drop releases beauty from her thousand"
1092,PEOPLE,prisons. The victim stands washed in a flood of light before which
1093,PEOPLE,imagination dies.
1094,PEOPLE,
1095,PEOPLE,Maldor (_speaks maliciously_)
1096,PEOPLE,
1097,PEOPLE,What unique philanthropy is this? Has Sobe the Poisoner dreamed of
1098,PEOPLE,immortality?
1099,PEOPLE,
1100,PEOPLE,Sobe (_gently_)
1101,PEOPLE,
1102,PEOPLE,Sobe the Poisoner has made a drop of poison which will create
1103,PEOPLE,beauty and death. In the soul of its victim these two monsters meet
1104,PEOPLE,and strive against each other. Immortal beauty and death remain
1105,PEOPLE,"clutched in a stifling caress. The poison, as it works upon its"
1106,PEOPLE,"victim, renders her more radiant and beautiful each moment, and"
1107,PEOPLE,each moment it paralyses her heart.
1108,PEOPLE,
1109,PEOPLE,Maldor
1110,PEOPLE,
1111,PEOPLE,And then what happens?
1112,PEOPLE,
1113,PEOPLE,Sobe
1114,PEOPLE,
1115,PEOPLE,"Bereft of life, but with a beauty which must resist death, the"
1116,PEOPLE,tortured one remains my own. Thus with my poison I become death’s
1117,PEOPLE,"master. Thus that which should die, does not die. Thus death"
1118,PEOPLE,advancing creates a flame which it cannot stifle.
1119,PEOPLE,
1120,PEOPLE,Maldor
1121,PEOPLE,
1122,PEOPLE,Beware.
1123,PEOPLE,
1124,PEOPLE,Sobe (_speaks with quickened emphasis_)
1125,PEOPLE,
1126,PEOPLE,Death is my slave. I summon him. I open a jewelled gate which he
1127,PEOPLE,cannot pass.
1128,PEOPLE,
1129,PEOPLE,Maldor (_speaks softly_)
1130,PEOPLE,
1131,PEOPLE,I do not like this poison.
1132,PEOPLE,
1133,PEOPLE,Sobe (_who smiles_)
1134,PEOPLE,
1135,PEOPLE,"You are an amateur of death, Maldor."
1136,PEOPLE,
1137,PEOPLE,Maldor (_softly_)
1138,PEOPLE,
1139,PEOPLE,I do not like this poison.
1140,PEOPLE,
1141,PEOPLE,Sobe
1142,PEOPLE,
1143,PEOPLE,"I will tell you another virtue of this poison, which perhaps will"
1144,PEOPLE,entice your fears.
1145,PEOPLE,
1146,PEOPLE,Maldor
1147,PEOPLE,
1148,PEOPLE,What is this virtue?
1149,PEOPLE,
1150,PEOPLE,Sobe
1151,PEOPLE,
1152,PEOPLE,Other poisons I have made provided us only with that little
1153,PEOPLE,"frenzied prelude to death. Our victims have amused us somewhat,"
1154,PEOPLE,"with unconscious heavings--little, docile marionettes in the"
1155,PEOPLE,"torments of poisons. But now, Maldor, our subject, inspired by the"
1156,PEOPLE,"ever-increasing loveliness of her body, by the ever-growing flame"
1157,PEOPLE,"of her beauty, resists in a torment beyond those instinctive spasms"
1158,PEOPLE,and dimly-felt agonies. Her overwhelming desire to prolong her
1159,PEOPLE,beauty makes the struggle against death wondrously hideous.
1160,PEOPLE,
1161,PEOPLE,Maldor
1162,PEOPLE,
1163,PEOPLE,"But since you say she cannot die, where will those struggles lead"
1164,PEOPLE,her?
1165,PEOPLE,
1166,PEOPLE,Sobe
1167,PEOPLE,
1168,PEOPLE,I do not know. I know only that a woman whose beauty feeds upon the
1169,PEOPLE,"shadows of death, must amuse us with a miracle."
1170,PEOPLE,
1171,PEOPLE,Maldor (_softly_)
1172,PEOPLE,
1173,PEOPLE,The virtue of this poison does not appeal to me. The miracle you
1174,PEOPLE,"promise is cluttered with subtle doubts. Death, betrayed, may"
1175,PEOPLE,blindly wander. Let us rather return to our pathetically certain
1176,PEOPLE,poisons and revel in the final froth-sprinkled caperings of life.
1177,PEOPLE,"Ah, the powdered hair of the white caterpillar, steeped in"
1178,PEOPLE,"moon-light, will cause the eyes to swell out of their sockets, and"
1179,PEOPLE,the tongue to burst.
1180,PEOPLE,
1181,PEOPLE,Sobe (_gently_)
1182,PEOPLE,
1183,PEOPLE,Where is Fana?
1184,PEOPLE,
1185,PEOPLE,Maldor
1186,PEOPLE,
1187,PEOPLE,Fana!
1188,PEOPLE,
1189,PEOPLE,Sobe
1190,PEOPLE,
1191,PEOPLE,Summon Fana to me.
1192,PEOPLE,
1193,PEOPLE,Maldor
1194,PEOPLE,
1195,PEOPLE,"Master, do not summon Fana."
1196,PEOPLE,
1197,PEOPLE,Sobe
1198,PEOPLE,
1199,PEOPLE,I shall make Fana beautiful.
1200,PEOPLE,
1201,PEOPLE,"(_Fana draws aside the portieres at the left. Fana is tall, with a"
1202,PEOPLE,majestic ugliness. She is dressed in a dark brown robe. Her face is
1203,PEOPLE,"swathed in a pale brown veil, knotted at the nape of the neck, and"
1204,PEOPLE,falling almost to her feet. She stands motionless. The two men turn and
1205,PEOPLE,stare at her._)
1206,PEOPLE,
1207,PEOPLE,Sobe (_softly_)
1208,PEOPLE,
1209,PEOPLE,I shall bring the poison.
1210,PEOPLE,
1211,PEOPLE,(_He rises and departs through the right entrance. Maldor rises and
1212,PEOPLE,continues to look steadily at Fana._)
1213,PEOPLE,
1214,PEOPLE,Fana (_gently_)
1215,PEOPLE,
1216,PEOPLE,I heard the word beauty.
1217,PEOPLE,
1218,PEOPLE,Maldor
1219,PEOPLE,
1220,PEOPLE,What else did you hear?
1221,PEOPLE,
1222,PEOPLE,Fana
1223,PEOPLE,
1224,PEOPLE,I heard only the word beauty.
1225,PEOPLE,
1226,PEOPLE,Maldor
1227,PEOPLE,
1228,PEOPLE,The master is evil tonight.
1229,PEOPLE,
1230,PEOPLE,Fana
1231,PEOPLE,
1232,PEOPLE,More evil than always?
1233,PEOPLE,
1234,PEOPLE,Maldor
1235,PEOPLE,
1236,PEOPLE,Even more.
1237,PEOPLE,
1238,PEOPLE,Fana
1239,PEOPLE,
1240,PEOPLE,What does he do?
1241,PEOPLE,
1242,PEOPLE,Maldor
1243,PEOPLE,
1244,PEOPLE,He frightens me with a mockery of death.
1245,PEOPLE,
1246,PEOPLE,Fana
1247,PEOPLE,
1248,PEOPLE,What did he say of beauty?
1249,PEOPLE,
1250,PEOPLE,Maldor
1251,PEOPLE,
1252,PEOPLE,"Fana, go before he returns."
1253,PEOPLE,
1254,PEOPLE,"(_Maldor quickly walks to the right entrance, draws aside the portieres,"
1255,PEOPLE,and peers cautiously out. He returns quickly to Fana._)
1256,PEOPLE,
1257,PEOPLE,Maldor (_speaking quickly_)
1258,PEOPLE,
1259,PEOPLE,He has a poison to make you beautiful.
1260,PEOPLE,
1261,PEOPLE,Fana
1262,PEOPLE,
1263,PEOPLE,Ah!
1264,PEOPLE,
1265,PEOPLE,Maldor
1266,PEOPLE,
1267,PEOPLE,Go!
1268,PEOPLE,
1269,PEOPLE,Fana
1270,PEOPLE,
1271,PEOPLE,Is he weary of my ugliness?
1272,PEOPLE,
1273,PEOPLE,Maldor
1274,PEOPLE,
1275,PEOPLE,"No. He has no thought for you. He seeks to enslave his master,"
1276,PEOPLE,Death.
1277,PEOPLE,
1278,PEOPLE,Fana
1279,PEOPLE,
1280,PEOPLE,But I did hear him speak of beauty.
1281,PEOPLE,
1282,PEOPLE,Maldor (_desperately_)
1283,PEOPLE,
1284,PEOPLE,He means to make you the flowered tomb of beauty. I can tell you no
1285,PEOPLE,more. Go!
1286,PEOPLE,
1287,PEOPLE,Fana
1288,PEOPLE,
1289,PEOPLE,Why do you tell me this? I have seen you smile upon things less
1290,PEOPLE,subtle than tombs.
1291,PEOPLE,
1292,PEOPLE,Maldor
1293,PEOPLE,
1294,PEOPLE,I love you.
1295,PEOPLE,
1296,PEOPLE,Fana
1297,PEOPLE,
1298,PEOPLE,It is easy to love that which is veiled. But perhaps you love me
1299,PEOPLE,because my face is so gentle a poison.
1300,PEOPLE,
1301,PEOPLE,Maldor
1302,PEOPLE,
1303,PEOPLE,I know not ugliness. It is a mood which has forsaken me. I plead
1304,PEOPLE,with you to go.
1305,PEOPLE,
1306,PEOPLE,(_Maldor hears Sobe’s footfalls and seats himself impassively upon his
1307,PEOPLE,cushion._)
1308,PEOPLE,
1309,PEOPLE,Fana (_softly_)
1310,PEOPLE,
1311,PEOPLE,I shall remain.
1312,PEOPLE,
1313,PEOPLE,(_Sobe enters. He bows to Fana._)
1314,PEOPLE,
1315,PEOPLE,Sobe
1316,PEOPLE,
1317,PEOPLE,"Ah, Fana, I shall make your stay pleasant."
1318,PEOPLE,
1319,PEOPLE,_Fana_--
1320,PEOPLE,
1321,PEOPLE,"Yes, Master."
1322,PEOPLE,
1323,PEOPLE,(_She seats herself behind the candle between Sobe and Maldor._)
1324,PEOPLE,
1325,PEOPLE,_Sobe_ (_gently_)--
1326,PEOPLE,
1327,PEOPLE,"You are very ugly, Fana. You wear a veil because you are ugly."
1328,PEOPLE,
1329,PEOPLE,_Fana_--
1330,PEOPLE,
1331,PEOPLE,I heard you speak of beauty.
1332,PEOPLE,
1333,PEOPLE,_Sobe_--
1334,PEOPLE,
1335,PEOPLE,Your body is like a broken cloud. Your face is like a pottery that
1336,PEOPLE,crumbles in the light. You are not beautiful.
1337,PEOPLE,
1338,PEOPLE,_Fana_ (_softly_)--
1339,PEOPLE,
1340,PEOPLE,Why do you tell me this so carefully?
1341,PEOPLE,
1342,PEOPLE,_Sobe_--
1343,PEOPLE,
1344,PEOPLE,To make you dream.
1345,PEOPLE,
1346,PEOPLE,_Fana_--
1347,PEOPLE,
1348,PEOPLE,Dreams are mirrors in which I do not care to look.
1349,PEOPLE,
1350,PEOPLE,_Sobe_--
1351,PEOPLE,
1352,PEOPLE,I have a poison that will open your hearts to dreams.
1353,PEOPLE,
1354,PEOPLE,_Fana_--
1355,PEOPLE,
1356,PEOPLE,The dream which poison brings is too long.
1357,PEOPLE,
1358,PEOPLE,_Sobe_--
1359,PEOPLE,
1360,PEOPLE,This poison brings two dreams. One of beauty and one of death.
1361,PEOPLE,Would you listen to them?
1362,PEOPLE,
1363,PEOPLE,_Fana_--
1364,PEOPLE,
1365,PEOPLE,Listening to dreams one avoids the dreariness of sleep.
1366,PEOPLE,
1367,PEOPLE,_Sobe_ (_gently_)--
1368,PEOPLE,
1369,PEOPLE,"You are very ugly, Fana. I have a poison which will make you"
1370,PEOPLE,beautiful.
1371,PEOPLE,
1372,PEOPLE,_Fana_--
1373,PEOPLE,
1374,PEOPLE,"To lie beautiful in death is a lyric privilege, but so faint an"
1375,PEOPLE,echo.
1376,PEOPLE,
1377,PEOPLE,_Sobe_--
1378,PEOPLE,
1379,PEOPLE,You reason too simply. I cannot promise you life. Perhaps your
1380,PEOPLE,pleasure will be only that of one who greets a phantom lover. A
1381,PEOPLE,moment of loveliness and the thought of eternal beauty embalmed in
1382,PEOPLE,"a dark dream, may be all that shall be given to you before death."
1383,PEOPLE,
1384,PEOPLE,Fana
1385,PEOPLE,
1386,PEOPLE,And what else is possible?
1387,PEOPLE,
1388,PEOPLE,Sobe
1389,PEOPLE,
1390,PEOPLE,It is possible that you will become so beautiful that you cannot
1391,PEOPLE,"die. It is possible that Death, feeding your beauty, will exhaust"
1392,PEOPLE,"itself in a last gentle caress. Then you will still live, and"
1393,PEOPLE,"Death, a eunuch, will drag himself after you."
1394,PEOPLE,
1395,PEOPLE,Fana
1396,PEOPLE,
1397,PEOPLE,But why do you speak so eagerly? Surely your only interest does not
1398,PEOPLE,lie in my exchanging one veil for another.
1399,PEOPLE,
1400,PEOPLE,Maldor (_breaking his silence softly_)
1401,PEOPLE,
1402,PEOPLE,"No, Fana, my master dreams of edged subtleties."
1403,PEOPLE,
1404,PEOPLE,Sobe
1405,PEOPLE,
1406,PEOPLE,"Make them simple with your telling, Maldor."
1407,PEOPLE,
1408,PEOPLE,Maldor
1409,PEOPLE,
1410,PEOPLE,My master is weary of ordinary effects. He has watched too many
1411,PEOPLE,frenzied struggles. No longer do they intrigue him. He yearns for
1412,PEOPLE,something elaborate. He has dreamed of more fragile tortures. The
1413,PEOPLE,"poison he will give you brings no pain, but the beauty it creates"
1414,PEOPLE,"within you will sharpen to madness your desire to live, and my"
1415,PEOPLE,master will sit and look into your eyes.
1416,PEOPLE,
1417,PEOPLE,Sobe
1418,PEOPLE,
1419,PEOPLE,"Have you finished, Maldor?"
1420,PEOPLE,
1421,PEOPLE,Maldor
1422,PEOPLE,
1423,PEOPLE,Yes.
1424,PEOPLE,
1425,PEOPLE,Sobe (_gently_)
1426,PEOPLE,
1427,PEOPLE,"I desire another assistant, Fana. As you see, one who will serve me"
1428,PEOPLE,"more faithfully, and whose loves are not so obvious. I will tell"
1429,PEOPLE,you why I am so eager. I wish simply to master death.
1430,PEOPLE,
1431,PEOPLE,Fana
1432,PEOPLE,
1433,PEOPLE,Have you the poison?
1434,PEOPLE,
1435,PEOPLE,Sobe
1436,PEOPLE,
1437,PEOPLE,Here.
1438,PEOPLE,
1439,PEOPLE,(_He takes from his robe a small flagon and hands it to her._)
1440,PEOPLE,
1441,PEOPLE,Sobe
1442,PEOPLE,
1443,PEOPLE,I have hidden the drop in wine.
1444,PEOPLE,
1445,PEOPLE,"(_Fana rises and lifts her veil from her mouth. She drinks, smiling at"
1446,PEOPLE,"Maldor, who sits and stares impassively ahead of him. Sobe rises and"
1447,PEOPLE,"moves to the back of the room, watching her._)"
1448,PEOPLE,
1449,PEOPLE,Fana
1450,PEOPLE,
1451,PEOPLE,I have drunk.
1452,PEOPLE,
1453,PEOPLE,Sobe (_softly_)
1454,PEOPLE,
1455,PEOPLE,Unveil yourself.
1456,PEOPLE,
1457,PEOPLE,(_Fana unveils herself._)
1458,PEOPLE,

1461,PEOPLE,Ah!

1463,PEOPLE,"(_He draws aside a panel portiere in the rear draperies, and a long"
1464,PEOPLE,narrow mirror is revealed._)
1465,PEOPLE,
1466,PEOPLE,Sobe

1468,PEOPLE,Look.

1472,PEOPLE,Ah!

1479,PEOPLE,
1480,PEOPLE,I grow more beautiful.
1481,PEOPLE,

1484,PEOPLE,Your eyes....

1508,PEOPLE,Your body....

1601,PEOPLE,"is visible. A dark purple wall frames the window, and narrow rectangles"
1602,PEOPLE,"of the wall, below and to the left of the window-corner, are visible."
1603,PEOPLE,Before the window corner is the portion of a pale pink floor. One tall
1604,PEOPLE,thin white candle stands against the dark purple rectangle of wall to
1605,PEOPLE,the left of the window-corner. It bears a narrow flame which remains
1606,PEOPLE,stationary. Soft and clear light pours in from the window-corner and dim
1607,PEOPLE,shapes stand behind it. The Mad Shepherd appears from the left. He holds
1608,PEOPLE,"a reed to his lips, but does not blow into it. A long brown cloak drapes"
1609,PEOPLE,him: black sandals are on his feet. His black hair caresses his

1617,PEOPLE,"Have you seen him, window clearer than the clashing light-bubbles"
1618,PEOPLE,in a woman’s eyes? (_A pause._) I sat on a rock in the midst of my
1619,PEOPLE,"sheep and smiled at the piping of my young soul, as it climbed a"
1620,PEOPLE,"spirit-tree. Soon it would whirl joyously on the tip of the tree,"
1621,PEOPLE,and my heart would turn with it. Then the song brushed past me and
1622,PEOPLE,"made my head a burning feather dropping down. I stumbled after it,"
1623,PEOPLE,"over the sun-dazed hills, and the reed-limbed boy would often stop,"
1624,PEOPLE,"touch both of my eyes with the song-flower, and spring away. I saw"
1625,PEOPLE,"him dance into this black palace. I followed, through high"
1626,PEOPLE,"corridors, to you, palest purple window, towering over me like a"
