343,CALENDAR,"Choosing the flowers he will bring to bloom,"
344,CALENDAR,"Dreams over my garden,"
345,CALENDAR,So still the dust shines on his burning wings.
346,CALENDAR,And sometimes he swings away towards the evening star
347,CALENDAR,To fill his basket claws with night.
348,CALENDAR,"Come morning he sprinkles darkness with his gold,"
349,CALENDAR,Rubs legs together--I saw him do it--
350,CALENDAR,And there’s a purple larkspur tapering into rose
351,CALENDAR,"And blood-red columbine,--"

355,CALENDAR,"And there’s a poppy’s glossy wrinkled cup,--"
356,CALENDAR,Then it’s June.
357,CALENDAR,
358,CALENDAR,At times he scoops the white crest off a wave
359,CALENDAR,Into the basket of his claws--
360,CALENDAR,I’ve seen the big bee skip upon the lake for joy--
361,CALENDAR,Then zi-ig! He’s back again
362,CALENDAR,"Spreading some lilies by the sandy path,"
363,CALENDAR,White with gold dashed on their lips
364,CALENDAR,Where he clings--the big bee--sucking.
365,CALENDAR,I know he’s there because the bells ring so:
366,CALENDAR,"Seven lilies, then five, then four,"
367,CALENDAR,"I count them on their stems,"
368,CALENDAR,"An octave’s length of melody,"

377,CALENDAR,With which to hang a hundred winter dawns and dusks.
378,CALENDAR,"Still, he spares a little for my garden’s need,"

381,CALENDAR,
382,CALENDAR,"The bee, the big bee, the burning bee"
383,CALENDAR,Begins and ends in gold.
384,CALENDAR,"In spring, knocking the snow from rosy apple bloom,"
385,CALENDAR,He climbs the sky with fagots on his back
386,CALENDAR,To scatter them in yellow willow twigs and daffodils;
387,CALENDAR,"And when he leaves my garden for his sleep,"
388,CALENDAR,"Flings daffodils along an evening sky,--"

392,CALENDAR,"Pooh! I say the sun is a bee, a big bee, a burning bee,"

395,CALENDAR,Or a saffron butterfly
396,CALENDAR,Or a gray-hooded moth at dusk!
397,CALENDAR,
398,CALENDAR,I’ve seen him when he was an emerald dragon fly
399,CALENDAR,"About my little garden’s pool,"

401,CALENDAR,He has his mysteries.
402,CALENDAR,His winter’s cell of silver white has neither rose nor red nor gold.

638,II,My garments were fresh and silken like poplar leaves
639,II,And there were more than I needed;
640,II,"And my hair was soft and thick,"
641,II,With gold always in it as in the larch in early spring;
642,II,And my body was lithe and vigorous;
643,II,"When I was tired it was the quick dip of the sapling in the storm,"
644,II,The least clearing wind set me free again
645,II,And I stood straight with all my quivering aspen leaves

655,III,And feel the hunger of old women and backyard cats
656,III,As if it were my own hunger;
657,III,And the wind noses about for crumbs in a bit of newspaper
658,III,"And flaps tattered dirty shawls over me,"
659,III,And my thoughts are bent and old
660,III,And I shiver in the dark trying to bless God.
661,III,I wonder why God gives Himself to trees
662,III,And lets old women starve?
663,III,And backyard cats nose for crumbs in a piece of newspaper?
664,III,And why certain rich people are as well varnished against cold
665,III,As fat beech buds against the frost?
666,III,Do you suppose God is a Merchant
667,III,And sells this warm lustre from the stars--
668,III,Stars hung like bright drops of water in a big night wind--

1905,DUST AND DREAMS,Ago; with pebbles washed ashore and fears
1906,DUST AND DREAMS,Released and feathers broken from the wing
1907,DUST AND DREAMS,That beat its westward flight towards the sun
1908,DUST AND DREAMS,And some far nest beside some unknown sea:
1909,DUST AND DREAMS,"I would not answer when you called to me,"

1918,DUST AND DREAMS,Alone I go towards that glistening stone
1919,DUST AND DREAMS,"Which marks your rest, my thought a prayer for you."
1920,DUST AND DREAMS,
1921,DUST AND DREAMS,Singing the water rushes past your quiet grave
1922,DUST AND DREAMS,Beneath this little town whose ancient name
1923,DUST AND DREAMS,Suggests the fair collegiate dream and fame
1924,DUST AND DREAMS,Of Oxford and her clustered towers. With wave
1925,DUST AND DREAMS,The river winds a garland for your rest--
1926,DUST AND DREAMS,The woven sound of grieving without end.
