132,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
133,INTRODUCTION,
134,INTRODUCTION,
135,INTRODUCTION,Poetry is one of the realities that persist. The façade and dome of
136,INTRODUCTION,"palace and temple, the monuments of heroes and saints, crumble before"
137,INTRODUCTION,"the ruining breath of time, while the Psalms last. So when another"
138,INTRODUCTION,"year passes and we sum up our achievements, there is no achievement"
139,INTRODUCTION,more vital in registering the soul of a people than its poetry. But in
140,INTRODUCTION,"all things that men do, their relationship is objective except those"
141,INTRODUCTION,"things in which art, religion, love, and nature express their influence"
142,INTRODUCTION,through the private thoughts and feelings of men. These four things
143,INTRODUCTION,"are the realities, all the others are symbols. And the essence of art,"
144,INTRODUCTION,"as well as religion and love and nature, is a conscious and mysterious"
145,INTRODUCTION,"thing, called Poetry. And men will find, if they will only stop to"
146,INTRODUCTION,"look, that at the bottom of all this poetry, no matter what the theme"
147,INTRODUCTION,"or the particular artistic shaping, there is something with which they"
148,INTRODUCTION,"are familiar, because in their own souls there has been an unceasing"
149,INTRODUCTION,mystery which they find named in the magic utterance of some lonely and
150,INTRODUCTION,neglected maker of verses.
151,INTRODUCTION,
152,INTRODUCTION,The poetry in the magazines for this past year has been of a general
153,INTRODUCTION,"high standard. The long poems have been well sustained, and there has"
154,INTRODUCTION,been a larger quantity of pure lyric pieces than in the past two or
155,INTRODUCTION,three years. The influence of Masefield has shown itself in American
156,INTRODUCTION,"verse, notably in the two long poems by Harry Kemp, “The Harvest"
157,INTRODUCTION,Hand” and “The Factory.” One of the noblest poems of the year is Henry
158,INTRODUCTION,"van Dyke’s “Daybreak in the Grand Cañon of Arizona,” which breathes a"
159,INTRODUCTION,"fine national spirit, full of reverence for the greatness with which"
160,INTRODUCTION,the American destiny is symbolized in the natural grandeur of our
161,INTRODUCTION,"country. Mr. Markham has a long narrative in “The Shoes of Happiness,”"
162,INTRODUCTION,full of his visionary and spiritual promptings. And in “The Vision of
163,INTRODUCTION,Gettysburg” Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson reflects also the national
164,INTRODUCTION,spirit with particular significance.
165,INTRODUCTION,
166,INTRODUCTION,The poetry of the year in volumes has not been as ample as last year.
167,INTRODUCTION,The three poets who have aroused most discussion are the Bengali poet
168,INTRODUCTION,"Tagore, who brought to the Western world in “Gitanjali” a spiritual"
169,INTRODUCTION,"message full of mystic but exalted idealism; Francis Thompson, the"
170,INTRODUCTION,"great Catholic poet, because of the publication of his collected"
171,INTRODUCTION,"works; and Robert Bridges, who, by his appointment to the English"
172,INTRODUCTION,"laureateship, became known to a large number of readers who had"
173,INTRODUCTION,hitherto been unfamiliar with his very perfect and delicate gift of
174,INTRODUCTION,"lyric beauty. Of American poets the volumes by Fannie Stearns Davis,"
175,INTRODUCTION,"William Rose Benét, Josephine Preston Peabody, Margaret Root Garvin,"
176,INTRODUCTION,and George Edward Woodberry are the most significant. The most
177,INTRODUCTION,"important book of poems of the year by an American poet, however, is"
178,INTRODUCTION,"that of Nicholas Vachel Lindsay, “General William Booth Enters into"
179,INTRODUCTION,"Heaven and Other Poems.” Here is a man with a big vision, with a"
180,INTRODUCTION,"fine originality, and an art that is particularly his own. There has"
181,INTRODUCTION,"been no “Lyric Year” this autumn, but a little volume that serves"
182,INTRODUCTION,in some sense its purpose is Miss Jessie B. Rittenhouse’s “Little
183,INTRODUCTION,"Book of Modern Verse,” which is intended to represent the quality of"
184,INTRODUCTION,contemporary American verse.
185,INTRODUCTION,
186,INTRODUCTION,I want to call attention to a poet who has not yet presented himself
187,INTRODUCTION,"except through an occasional magazine piece, but who has written two"
188,INTRODUCTION,"of the finest sonnets in American poetry. Last year I reprinted, in my"
189,INTRODUCTION,"annual summary, Mr. Mahlon Leonard Fisher’s “As an Old Mercer,” and"
190,INTRODUCTION,pronounced that an achievement which could hardly be surpassed. But
191,INTRODUCTION,"in the sonnet “November,” which is reprinted in this book, Mr. Fisher"
192,INTRODUCTION,"has done, I believe, something that is even greater. It must rank with"
193,INTRODUCTION,Lizette Woodworth Reese’s “Tears” and Longfellow’s “Nature” as the best
194,INTRODUCTION,sonnets that have been accomplished by American poets. I have known one
195,INTRODUCTION,competent judge and lover of poetry to declare that not since Keats’
196,INTRODUCTION,“On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer” and Miss Reese’s “Tears” has
197,INTRODUCTION,there appeared so fine a sonnet in English poetry. The man who has
198,INTRODUCTION,written “November” has added something to American poetry that cannot
199,INTRODUCTION,be too highly estimated.
200,INTRODUCTION,
201,INTRODUCTION,"Another poet who has enriched the magazines this year, after a period"
202,INTRODUCTION,"of silence, is Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson, and in “The Field of"
203,INTRODUCTION,Glory” we are under the spell once more of that characteristic magic
204,INTRODUCTION,with which he is endowed alone among American poets.
205,INTRODUCTION,
206,INTRODUCTION,"As in former years, in my annual summary in the _Boston Transcript_, I"
207,INTRODUCTION,have examined the contents of the leading American monthly magazines.
208,INTRODUCTION,"I originally started, nine years ago, when the first summary appeared,"
209,INTRODUCTION,"with these six: The Atlantic, Harper’s, Scribner’s, Century,"
210,INTRODUCTION,"Lippincott’s, and McClure’s. Later I turned to The Forum. The poetry in"
211,INTRODUCTION,McClure’s during the two years previous to the beginning of the present
212,INTRODUCTION,year had fallen off; the magazine would reprint occasionally verses
213,INTRODUCTION,from the books of accomplished but little known English and Irish
214,INTRODUCTION,"poets, which, with the small amount of space that it devoted to verse,"
215,INTRODUCTION,left but little chance of encouragement to native singers. This year
216,INTRODUCTION,"I have included The Smart Set, which, under the new editorship of Mr."
217,INTRODUCTION,"Willard Huntington Wright, himself a poet of considerable attainment,"
218,INTRODUCTION,has been the means of offering the public a high and consistent
219,INTRODUCTION,standard of excellence in the verse it printed.
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,"To the six magazines, namely, Harper’s, Scribner’s, Century, Forum,"
222,INTRODUCTION,"Lippincott’s, and The Smart Set, I have added this year a weekly, The"
223,INTRODUCTION,Bellman. West of New York it is the best edited and most influential
224,INTRODUCTION,"periodical published. Indeed, it is widely read in the East. In its"
225,INTRODUCTION,pages three of the younger American poets of distinctive achievement
226,INTRODUCTION,have been presented. Though the late Arthur Upson had published some
227,INTRODUCTION,"two or three books of verse before The Bellman was established, yet it"
228,INTRODUCTION,was practically the first American magazine to print his work. Amelia
229,INTRODUCTION,"J. Burr made her first considerable poetic appearance in The Bellman,"
230,INTRODUCTION,"and the best work, the sonnets that have placed Mr. Mahlon Leonard"
231,INTRODUCTION,"Fisher in the forefront of contemporary American, or English, sonnet"
232,INTRODUCTION,"writers, appeared in this same publication. As last year, I have"
233,INTRODUCTION,winnowed from other magazines distinctive poems for classification and
234,INTRODUCTION,"notice, one each from The Outlook, The Independent, the North American"
235,INTRODUCTION,"Review, Poetry, A Magazine of Verse; three from the Poetry Journal and"
236,INTRODUCTION,three from the Yale Review.

239,INTRODUCTION,
240,INTRODUCTION,The poems published during the year in the seven representative
241,INTRODUCTION,"magazines I have submitted to an impartial critical test, choosing from"
242,INTRODUCTION,the total number what I consider the “distinctive” poems of the year.
243,INTRODUCTION,"From the distinctive pieces are selected eighty-one poems, to which"
244,INTRODUCTION,are added five from the other magazines not represented in the list of
245,INTRODUCTION,"seven, making a total of eighty-six, which are intended to represent"
246,INTRODUCTION,what I call an “Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1913.”
247,INTRODUCTION,
248,INTRODUCTION,"By a further process of elimination, similar to that of previous years,"
249,INTRODUCTION,I have made another selection of forty poems which for one reason or
250,INTRODUCTION,another in the purpose of this estimate seem to stand grouped above the
251,INTRODUCTION,others.
252,INTRODUCTION,
253,INTRODUCTION,"The medium of magazine publication, towards which some critics,"
254,INTRODUCTION,"and some poets too (a fact which can hardly be justified), and a"
255,INTRODUCTION,"considerable portion of the reading public have a disparaging opinion,"
256,INTRODUCTION,is deserving of better repute for the general high quality of poetic
257,INTRODUCTION,art that is published. Not many years ago it was a favorite exercise of
258,INTRODUCTION,"the reviewer, when noticing the average book of verse which happened"
259,INTRODUCTION,"to include selections reprinted from various magazines, to term the"
260,INTRODUCTION,"work “magazinable,” or the poet a “magazine poet.” Even poets who"
261,INTRODUCTION,detested being called “minor” poets preferred that rather vague and
262,INTRODUCTION,"indiscriminate distinction, rather than the unrespectable “magazinable.”"
263,INTRODUCTION,
264,INTRODUCTION,"Quoting what I have written in previous years, to emphasize the"
265,INTRODUCTION,"methods which guided my selections, the reader will see how impartial"
266,INTRODUCTION,are the tests by which the distinctive and best poems are chosen: “I
267,INTRODUCTION,have not allowed any special sympathy with the subject to influence
268,INTRODUCTION,"my choice. I have taken the poet’s point of view, and accepted his"
269,INTRODUCTION,value of the theme he dealt with. The question was: How vital and
270,INTRODUCTION,compelling did he make it? The first test was the sense of pleasure the
271,INTRODUCTION,poem communicated; then to discover the secret or the meaning of the
272,INTRODUCTION,pleasure felt; and in doing so to realize how much richer one became in
273,INTRODUCTION,a knowledge of the purpose of life by reason of the poem’s message.”
274,INTRODUCTION,
275,INTRODUCTION,In one hundred and twenty-one numbers of these seven magazines I find
276,INTRODUCTION,there were published during 1913 a total of 506 poems. The total number
277,INTRODUCTION,"of poems printed in each magazine, and the number of the distinctive"
278,INTRODUCTION,"poems are: Century, total 58, 30 of distinction; Harper’s, total 57, 29"
279,INTRODUCTION,"of distinction; Scribner’s, total 45, 30 of distinction; Forum, total"
280,INTRODUCTION,"53, 27 of distinction; Lippincott’s, total 66, 21 of distinction; The"
281,INTRODUCTION,"Bellman, total 53, 25 of distinction; The Smart Set, total 169, 49 of"
282,INTRODUCTION,distinction.
283,INTRODUCTION,
284,INTRODUCTION,"Following the text of the poems making the anthology in this volume, I"
285,INTRODUCTION,have given the titles and authors of all the poems classified as the
286,INTRODUCTION,"distinctive, published in the magazines for the year, only excepting"
287,INTRODUCTION,those that are included in the anthology; in addition I give a list
288,INTRODUCTION,of all the poems and their authors in the one hundred and twenty-one
289,INTRODUCTION,"numbers of the magazines examined, for the purpose of a record which"
290,INTRODUCTION,readers and students of poetry will find useful.
291,INTRODUCTION,
292,INTRODUCTION,I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness and thanks to the editors
293,INTRODUCTION,"of Scribner’s Magazine, Harper’s Magazine, The Forum, The Century"
294,INTRODUCTION,"Magazine, The Outlook, Lippincott’s Magazine, The Bellman, The"
295,INTRODUCTION,"Independent, The Smart Set, the Yale Review, Poetry, A Magazine of"
296,INTRODUCTION,"Verse; and to the publishers of these magazines, including The Poetry"
297,INTRODUCTION,"Journal, for the permission kindly given to reprint in this volume the"
298,INTRODUCTION,text of the poems making the “Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1913.” To
299,INTRODUCTION,the authors of these poems I am equally indebted and grateful for their
300,INTRODUCTION,willingness to have me reprint their work in this form. Since their
301,INTRODUCTION,appearance in the magazines and before the close of the year when the
302,INTRODUCTION,"contents of this volume was made up, two poems herein included appeared"
303,INTRODUCTION,in the original volumes of their authors. For the use of William Rose
304,INTRODUCTION,Benét’s “The Marvelous Munchausen” I have also to thank The Century
305,INTRODUCTION,"Co., publishers of “Merchants of Cathay,” in which volume it appears."
306,INTRODUCTION,"As far as I know, only three of the poems here included are to come"
307,INTRODUCTION,out immediately in books by their authors. The last four stanzas of “A
308,INTRODUCTION,"Threnody,” by Mr. Louis V. Ledoux, are reprinted by permission of the"
309,INTRODUCTION,"editor of Scribner’s Magazine, and the rest of the poem is published in"
310,INTRODUCTION,"advance, by permission of Messrs. G. P. Putnam’s Sons, from a volume"
311,INTRODUCTION,"of Mr. Ledoux’s poems, which is also to include the “Hymn to Demeter”"
312,INTRODUCTION,"from “A Sicilian Idyl,” they are to issue in January, under the title"
313,INTRODUCTION,"of “The Shadow of Ætna.” The two selections by Mr. Richard Burton,"
314,INTRODUCTION,"“Here Lies Pierrot” and “Human”; the two by Willard Huntington Wright,"
315,INTRODUCTION,"“What of the Night?” and “Later”; the one by George Edward Woodberry,"
316,INTRODUCTION,"“St. John and the Faun”; and the two by Richard Le Gallienne, “May is"
317,INTRODUCTION,Building Her House” and “Desiderium” (which while this Introduction
318,INTRODUCTION,"is being written has come out in Mr. Le Gallienne’s volume, “The"
319,INTRODUCTION,"Lonely Dancer and Other Poems,” John Lane Co.), are also being issued"
320,INTRODUCTION,immediately in forthcoming volumes. If there are any others I do not
321,INTRODUCTION,"know of them, and in which case I would gladly give credit, so I"
322,INTRODUCTION,trust any omission of such will be charged to ignorance rather than
323,INTRODUCTION,intention. I wish it to be understood that the privilege extended me so
324,INTRODUCTION,"courteously, by both the authors and the magazines, to print the poems"
325,INTRODUCTION,"in this volume, does not in any sense restrict the authors in their"
326,INTRODUCTION,rights to print the poems in volumes of their own.
327,INTRODUCTION,
328,INTRODUCTION,A significant fact which the poetry in this volume must bring to the
329,INTRODUCTION,"reader’s mind in considering American poetry of today is, that these"
330,INTRODUCTION,selections have been published for the first time during the current
331,INTRODUCTION,"year. Our poetry needs, more than anything else, encouragement and"
332,INTRODUCTION,"support, to reveal its qualities. The poets are doing satisfying and"
333,INTRODUCTION,"vitally excellent work, and it only remains for the American public to"
334,INTRODUCTION,do its duty by showing a substantial appreciation.
335,INTRODUCTION,
336,INTRODUCTION,"Lastly, I wish to thank the Boston Transcript for the privilege of"
337,INTRODUCTION,reprinting material in this book which originally appeared in the
338,INTRODUCTION,columns of that paper.

779,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,Folded within its nest;
780,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,Had caught the last light kiss
781,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,Before the lips lay still;
782,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,"And I had looked into the cool grey deep,"
783,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,"Where Sleep received the rose-leaf soul of her,"
784,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,And bore it out upon her gentle waters.
785,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,
786,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,"Into the night I passed,"
787,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,"Where on the mellow bosom of the west,"
788,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,Floated the flame-lit shell of Hesperus;
789,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,"And as I stayed with hallowed breath,"
790,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,The soul of fire fell over the rim of night:
791,TO A CHILD FALLING ASLEEP,"And then I knew the soul of her I loved,"

906,SAPPHO,"I go not bitterly, not dumb with grief,"
907,SAPPHO,Not broken by the ache of love--I go
908,SAPPHO,As one grown tired lies down and hopes to sleep.
909,SAPPHO,Yet they shall say: “It was for Cercolas--
910,SAPPHO,She died because she could not bear her love.”
911,SAPPHO,They shall remember how we used to walk
912,SAPPHO,"Here on the cliff beneath the oleanders,"
913,SAPPHO,"In the long limpid twilight of the spring,"
914,SAPPHO,Looking toward Khios where the amber sky
915,SAPPHO,Was pierced by the faint arrow of a star.
916,SAPPHO,How should they know the wind of a new beauty
917,SAPPHO,Sweeping my soul had winnowed it with song?
918,SAPPHO,"I have been glad tho’ love should come or go,"

926,SAPPHO,With thirst unslaked in the brief southward sun.
927,SAPPHO,"Ah, Dica, it is not for thee I go."
928,SAPPHO,"And not for Phaon, tho’ his ship lifts sail"
929,SAPPHO,"Here in the windless harbor, for the south."
930,SAPPHO,"Oh, darkling deities that guard the Nile,"
931,SAPPHO,Watch over one whose gods are far away;
932,SAPPHO,"Egypt, be kind to him--his eyes are deep."
933,SAPPHO,"Yet they are wrong who say, it was for him."

935,SAPPHO,"Faithful to love, not faithful to the lover,"
936,SAPPHO,"Never transfused and lost in what she loved,"
937,SAPPHO,Never so wholly loving nor at peace.
938,SAPPHO,"I asked for something greater than I found,"
939,SAPPHO,"And every time that love has made me weep,"
940,SAPPHO,I have rejoiced that love could be so strong;
941,SAPPHO,For I have stood apart and watched my soul
942,SAPPHO,"Caught in the gust of passion, as a bird"
943,SAPPHO,With baffled wings against the dusty whirlwind
944,SAPPHO,Struggles and frees itself to find the sky.

950,SAPPHO,I will not be a reed to hold the sound
951,SAPPHO,"Of whatsoever breath the gods may blow,"
952,SAPPHO,Turning my torment into music for them.
953,SAPPHO,"They gave me life--the gift was bountiful,"
954,SAPPHO,"I lived with the swift singing strength of fire,"
955,SAPPHO,"Seeking for beauty as a flame for fuel,"
956,SAPPHO,Beauty in all things and in every hour.
957,SAPPHO,"The gods have given life, I gave them song;"
958,SAPPHO,The debt is paid and now I turn to go.

1638,II,All day he hastened like the flying cloud
1639,II,"Breathless above him, big with dreams, yet dumb."
1640,II,"With tightened jaw he chewed the tart spruce gum,"
1641,II,And muttered half aloud
1642,II,"Huge oracles. At last, where thro’ the pine-tops bowed"
1643,II,"The sun, it rose!--His heart beat like a drum."

1650,III,"They learn to live who learn to contemplate,"
1651,III,For contemplation is the unconfined
1652,III,God who creates us. To the growing mind
1653,III,"Freedom to think is fate,"
1654,III,And all that age and after-knowledge augurate
1655,III,Lies in a little dream of youth enshrined:

1659,III,"Eben, in mystic tumult of his teens,"
1660,III,Stood bursting--like a ripe seed--into soul.
1661,III,All his life long he had watched the great hills roll
1662,III,"Their shadows, tints and sheens"
1663,III,"By sun- and moonrise; yet the bane of hoeing beans,"
1664,III,"And round of joyless chores, his father’s toll,"
1665,III,Blotted their beauty; nature was as naught:
1666,III,He had never _thought_.
1667,III,
1668,III,But now he climbed his boyhood’s castle tower
1669,III,"And knocked. Ah, well then for his after-fate"
1670,III,"That one of nature’s masters opened the gate,"
1671,III,Where like an April shower
1672,III,Live influence quickened all his earth-blind seed to power.
1673,III,"Strangely his sense of truth grew passionate,"
1674,III,"And like a young bull, led in yoke to drink,"
1675,III,He bowed to think.
1676,III,
1677,III,There also bowed their heads with him to quaff--
1678,III,The snorting herd! And many a wholesome grip
1679,III,He had of rivalry and fellowship.
1680,III,"Often the game was rough,"
1681,III,But Eben tossed his horns and never balked the cuff;
1682,III,For still through play and task his Dream would slip--
1683,III,"A radiant Herdsman, guiding destiny"
1684,III,To his degree.

1689,IV,Once more old Hezekiah stayed his hoe
1690,IV,"To squint at Eben. Silent, Eben scanned"
1691,IV,"A little roll of sheepskin in his hand,"
1692,IV,"While, row on dusky row,"
1693,IV,Tall bean poles ribbed with dark the gold-pale afterglow.
1694,IV,The boy looked up: here was another land!
1695,IV,Mountain and farm with mystic beauty flared
1696,IV,Where Eben stared.
1697,IV,
1698,IV,"Stooping, he lifted with a furtive smile"
1699,IV,"Two splintered sticks, and spliced them. Nevermore"
1700,IV,His spirit would go beastwise to his chore
1701,IV,"Blinded, for even while"
1702,IV,"He stooped to the old task, sudden in the sunset’s pile"
1703,IV,"His radiant Herdsman swung a fiery door,"
1704,IV,Thro’ which came forth with far-borne trumpetings
1705,IV,"Poets and kings,"
1706,IV,
1707,IV,"His fellow conquerors: there Virgil dreamed,"
1708,IV,"There Cæsar fought and won the barbarous tribes,"
1709,IV,"There Darwin, pensive, bore the ignorant gibes,"
1710,IV,And One with thorns redeemed
1711,IV,From malice the wild hearts of men: there surged and streamed
1712,IV,With chemic fire the forges of old scribes
1713,IV,Testing anew the crucibles of toil
1714,IV,To save God’s soil.
1715,IV,
1716,IV,"So Eben turned again to hoe his beans,"
1717,IV,"But now, to ballads which his Herdsman sung,"
1718,IV,"Henceforth he hoed the dream in with the dung,"
1719,IV,And for his ancient spleens
1720,IV,"Planting new joys, imagination found him means."
1721,IV,At last old Hezekiah loosed his tongue:
1722,IV,"“Well, boy, this school--what has it learned ye to know?”"
1723,IV,He said: “To hoe.”
