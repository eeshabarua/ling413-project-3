122,WHAT IS POETRY?,
123,WHAT IS POETRY?,"A group of poetry lovers asked the question, offering a prize of $50.00"
124,WHAT IS POETRY?,"for the best answer, and received five thousand responses. The"
125,WHAT IS POETRY?,"definition was restricted to thirty-five words, and must be in poetry."
126,WHAT IS POETRY?,"The judges were Florence Wilkinson, Edith Wynne Matthison, Ridgley"
127,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Torrence, Robert Frost, Edwin Markham and George E. Woodberry."
128,WHAT IS POETRY?,
129,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Definitions of poetry came from every State in the Union, and also from"
130,WHAT IS POETRY?,"London, Canada, Hawaii and Bermuda. The prize went to Miss Laney, a"
131,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Pawtucket (R. I.) school girl, who sent the following:"
132,WHAT IS POETRY?,
133,WHAT IS POETRY?,The magic light that springs
134,WHAT IS POETRY?,From the deep soul of things
135,WHAT IS POETRY?,"When, called by their true names,"

138,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Showing the soul’s estate,"
139,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Baring the hearts of men,"
140,WHAT IS POETRY?,Poetry!
141,WHAT IS POETRY?,
142,WHAT IS POETRY?,Poetry is the setting free of “the deep soul of things” and the calling
143,WHAT IS POETRY?,things by their “true names” so that men may know them. It is the
144,WHAT IS POETRY?,"imaginative expression of spiritual truth. It is thought, passion, life"
145,WHAT IS POETRY?,expressed in images.
146,WHAT IS POETRY?,
147,WHAT IS POETRY?,With this forecast I subjoin a brief history of the writer of these
148,WHAT IS POETRY?,lines in this little booklet and ask your considerate perusal.
149,WHAT IS POETRY?,
150,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Jamie Harris was born September 20, 1893, in Mayfield, Ky. In 1907 she"
151,WHAT IS POETRY?,completed the course of study prescribed for the City Public School of
152,WHAT IS POETRY?,"that place. After the death of her mother in January, 1908, and"
153,WHAT IS POETRY?,"subsequently the illness of her father, she was removed to Louisville,"
154,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Ky., by two older sisters in March, 1908. After reaching Louisville"
155,WHAT IS POETRY?,urgent demands made it necessary for her to abandon the idea of going to
156,WHAT IS POETRY?,"school and to seek employment, that her younger brother and sister might"
157,WHAT IS POETRY?,be kept in school and cared for. She reluctantly gave up day school but
158,WHAT IS POETRY?,a few years later the deep seated thirst for education prompted her to
159,WHAT IS POETRY?,enter night school where she remained until she finished in 1914. From a
160,WHAT IS POETRY?,child of nine years she showed that she was poetically inclined but she
161,WHAT IS POETRY?,did not attempt to cultivate this taste until 1912. Since that time she
162,WHAT IS POETRY?,"has written a large number of poems and one play, dramatized from the"
163,WHAT IS POETRY?,"book of “Ruth” and known as “Ruth the Gleaner,” which was played in"
164,WHAT IS POETRY?,sixteen Louisville churches. Her first recital of her poems was in
165,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Calvary Baptist Church, Louisville, Ky., October, 1913. Since that time"
166,WHAT IS POETRY?,"she has occasionally traveled, giving recitals of her own poems and it"
167,WHAT IS POETRY?,is to be hoped that in the future a larger number may be given to the
168,WHAT IS POETRY?,public.
