61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,"Neither desiring to plagiarize Cæsar nor to compare my book to Gaul, I"
63,PREFACE,wish to mention briefly that this volume as a whole is divided into
64,PREFACE,"three parts, of which one is occupied by the single poem, “The Dyak"
65,PREFACE,"Chief,” the verses that give title to the book; another, the second, is"
66,PREFACE,"occupied by American army ballads, and yet another, the third, is"
67,PREFACE,occupied by various verses on miscellaneous subjects.
68,PREFACE,
69,PREFACE,"However, if recollections of my personal campaigns against Cæsar--armed"
70,PREFACE,"only with a Latin vocabulary and grammar--serve me rightly, the old"
71,PREFACE,"Roman was not merely a worthy foe, but one who might well be held up as"
72,PREFACE,a worthy example; who dealt with his chronicles as he dealt with his
73,PREFACE,"enemies on the field, in a simple, direct, forcible manner, bare of"
74,PREFACE,"circumlocution, tautology or ambiguity--that he who runs may read--and"
75,PREFACE,"reading, know his Gaul and Gallic chieftains, his Cæsar and his Cæsar’s"
76,PREFACE,"legionaries, even as Cæsar knew them."
77,PREFACE,
78,PREFACE,"The initial poem, “The Dyak Chief,” forming Part One, is a romance of"
79,PREFACE,"Central Borneo, that I visited in July, 1908, during a little trip"
80,PREFACE,around the World.
81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,"Coming over from Java, which I had just finished touring, I arrived at"
83,PREFACE,"Bandjermasin, in southeastern Borneo, near the coast, and from whence I"
84,PREFACE,"took a small steamer up the Barito River to Poeroek Tjahoe, pronounced"
85,PREFACE,"“Poorook Jow,” deep in the interior of the island."
86,PREFACE,
87,PREFACE,"Poeroek Tjahoe was the last white (Dutch) settlement, and from there I"
88,PREFACE,went with three Malay coolies five days tramp on foot through the
89,PREFACE,"jungle, northwest, penetrating the very heart of Borneo, sleeping the"
90,PREFACE,"first three nights in the houses of the Dyaks, some nomadic tribes of"
91,PREFACE,"whom still roam the jungle as head-hunters, and the last two nights upon"
92,PREFACE,"improvised platforms out in the open, till I reached Batoe Paoe, a town"
93,PREFACE,or kampong in the geographical center of the island.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"I also visited a nearby village, Olong Liko, afterwards returning by the"
96,PREFACE,"Moeroeng and Barito Rivers to Poeroek Tjahoe, and from thence back to"
97,PREFACE,"Bandjermasin on the little river-steamer and then by boat to Singapore,"
98,PREFACE,"which was the radiating headquarters for my trips to Sumatra, Java,"
99,PREFACE,Borneo and Siam.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,"Having thus reached the very center of Borneo on foot, I had an"
102,PREFACE,"excellent opportunity to study the country, the people and the general"
103,PREFACE,"conditions, so that the reader of “The Dyak Chief” need feel no"
104,PREFACE,"hesitancy in accepting as accurate and authentic, all descriptions,"
105,PREFACE,details and touches of “local color” or “atmosphere” contained in the
106,PREFACE,poem.
107,PREFACE,
108,PREFACE,Full notes on “The Dyak Chief” will be found at the end of the volume.
109,PREFACE,
110,PREFACE,"Part Two contains a number of new American army ballads, gathered mostly"
111,PREFACE,as a result of my personal observations and experiences when serving as
112,PREFACE,"a private in Companies “L” and “G,” 23rd U. S. Infantry (Regulars) and"
113,PREFACE,"Troop “I,” 5th U. S. Cavalry (Regulars), during the Philippine"
114,PREFACE,Insurrection of 1899-1902.
115,PREFACE,
116,PREFACE,"As I have just mentioned, the army verses are all new ones, and"
117,PREFACE,consequently not to be found among those contained in my previous
118,PREFACE,"volume, “My Bunkie and Other Ballads.”"
119,PREFACE,
120,PREFACE,Part Three consists of individual poems on various subjects without any
121,PREFACE,interrelation.
122,PREFACE,
123,PREFACE,It is sincerely hoped that the reader will make full use of the notes
124,PREFACE,"appended at the end of the book, which addenda I have endeavored to"
125,PREFACE,treat with as much brevity as may be compatible with succinctness.

242,THE DYAK CHIEF,Though born year by year;
243,THE DYAK CHIEF,Till I thought of the headless waist I bore--
244,THE DYAK CHIEF,And I drew the maiden near:
245,THE DYAK CHIEF,
246,THE DYAK CHIEF,And I pledged her there by the tree-banked stream
247,THE DYAK CHIEF,"Where the rippling shadows flee,"
248,THE DYAK CHIEF,“None but the skull of a kampong chief

252,II,II
253,II,
254,II,When over the palm-topped endless hills
255,II,"First broke the golden day,"
256,II,The taintless breeze in the highest trees
257,II,Laughed as I swung away.
258,II,
259,II,Laughed as I climbed the mountain path
260,II,"Or skirted the river’s bank,"
261,II,And the great lianes sung to me
262,II,As on my knees I drank.
263,II,
264,II,And the great lianes softly swayed
265,II,"And twisted in snake-like guise,"
266,II,Till I lost their sight in the leafy height
267,II,Where peeped the purple skies.
268,II,
269,II,And down through the dank morasses
270,II,"I leapt from clod to clod,"
271,II,O’er fallen trunk and lifted root
272,II,And the ooze of the sunken sod--
273,II,
274,II,"Where the tiny trees stand tall and straight,"
275,II,"A mass of mossy green,"
276,II,And lighting all like a fairy hall
277,II,The sunlight sifts between.
278,II,
279,II,Day by day through stress and strain
280,II,I pressed my marches through;
281,II,Day by day through strain and stress
282,II,The weary hours flew.
283,II,
284,II,"And silent, from the dank brown leaves"
285,II,"As swept my hurrying tread,"
286,II,The little waiting leeches rose
287,II,And caught me as I sped.
288,II,
289,II,Till my feet and ankles bled in streams--
290,II,"But I let them clinging stay,"
291,II,And they swelled to seven times their size
292,II,And glutted and fell away.
293,II,
294,II,"For never time had I to stop,"
295,II,"And so they sucked their fill,"
296,II,As I splashed through the knee-deep rivers
297,II,And clambered the jungle hill.
298,II,
299,II,"And only night could halt me,"
300,II,"And the stars in their proud parade,"
301,II,"They bade me look to the fray before,"
302,II,And back to the kampong maid.
303,II,
304,II,
305,III,III
306,III,
307,III,Weary at last I reached a height
308,III,"That showed a fertile glade,"
309,III,Where the bending trees of the river brink
310,III,Leaned out o’er a wild cascade.
311,III,
312,III,And white above the waving banks
313,III,"The towering giants rose high,"
314,III,"And tossed their heads in hauteur,"
315,III,Full-plumed across the sky.
316,III,
317,III,And waved their long lianes
318,III,"A hundred feet in air,"
319,III,And shook their clinging vine-leaves
320,III,As a Dyak maid her hair.
321,III,
322,III,And down by the Moeroeng’s turning
323,III,"The river rock rose sheer,"
324,III,And out of the cracks the tasseled palms
325,III,Like mighty plumes hung clear.
326,III,
327,III,"While still, behind a boulder,"
328,III,"Where the little ripples gleam,"
329,III,A fisher sat in his sunken proa
330,III,In the midst of the gliding stream.
331,III,
332,III,Only the crash of the underbrush
333,III,"Told where a hunter sped,"
334,III,And I caught the glint of the morning sun
335,III,On the blow-spear’s glittering head.
336,III,
337,III,Only the crack of a mandauw
338,III,"Felling the little trees,"
339,III,And the murmuring call of a water-fall
340,III,That echoed the jungle breeze.
341,III,
342,III,But more to me than the hunter--
343,III,The fisher and stream and hill--
344,III,"Was the kampong deep in the hollow,"
345,III,Nestling dark and still.
346,III,
347,III,"Dark and still in the valley,"
348,III,A single house and strong;
349,III,Perched on piles two warriors high
350,III,And a hundred paces long.
351,III,
352,III,And straight before the tall-stepped door
353,III,"The mighty chief poles rose,"
354,III,And seemed to shake their tasseled tops
355,III,In warning to their foes--
356,III,
357,III,As they who slept beneath them
358,III,"Once did, when in their might--"
359,III,With shining steel and sinews--
360,III,Full-armed they sprang to fight.
361,III,
362,III,Long from the hill-side trees I watched
363,III,The water women go
364,III,"Back and forth to the river bank,"
365,III,Chattering to and fro.
366,III,
367,III,Long from the hill-side trees I watched
368,III,Till--straight as the windless flame--
369,III,"With spear and shield and mandauw,"
370,III,The kampong chieftain came.
371,III,
372,III,Full well I knew the waist-cloth blue
373,III,Where hung each shriveled head.
374,III,Full well I saw the eyes of awe
375,III,That followed in his tread.
376,III,
377,III,Full well I heard the spoken word--
378,III,The quick obedience fanned--
379,III,And I felt the trance of the royal glance
380,III,Of the Lord of the Jungle-land.
381,III,
382,III,Lightly he scorned the proffered guard
383,III,"As he strode the upland grade,"
384,III,And softly I drew my mandauw
385,III,And fingered the sharpened blade.
386,III,
387,III,Was it for game or a head he came
388,III,To the hills in the golden morn?
389,III,But little I cared as the heavens stared
390,III,On the day that my hope was born.
391,III,
392,III,For over and over I muttered--
393,III,As I slunk from tree to tree--
394,III,“None but the head of a kampong chief
395,III,Shall hang at my belt for thee.”
396,III,
397,III,(None but the head of a kampong chief
398,III,"For you my belt shall grace,"
399,III,Taken by right in fairest fight--
400,III,Full-fronted--face to face.)
401,III,
402,III,And I found a leafy clearing
403,III,"That lay across his path,"
404,III,And I stood to wait his coming--
405,III,The chieftain in his wrath.
406,III,
407,III,As the moan before the wind-storm
408,III,"That breaks across the night,"
409,III,"Were the rhythmic, muffled foot falls"
410,III,Of the war-lord come to fight.
411,III,
412,III,The crack of little branches--
413,III,The branches pushed away--
414,III,And the Scourge of the Moeroeng Valley
415,III,Sprang straight to the waiting fray.
416,III,
417,III,’Twas then I knew the stories true
418,III,"They told of his fearful fame,"
419,III,As through my shield a hand’s-length
420,III,His hurtling spearhead came.
421,III,
422,III,Stunned I reeled and a moment kneeled
423,III,"To the shock of the blinding blow,"
424,III,But I rose again at the stinging pain
425,III,And the wet of the warm blood’s flow.
426,III,
427,III,And I staggered straight and I scorned to wait
428,III,And I swept my mandauw high--
429,III,But ere my stroke descended
430,III,He smote me athwart the thigh.
431,III,
432,III,As the lean rattan at the workman’s knife--
433,III,As the stricken game in the dell--
434,III,"As a bird on the wing at the blow-spear’s sting,"
435,III,To the reddened earth I fell.
436,III,
437,III,And merrily with fiendish glee
438,III,He knelt and held me fast;
439,III,And I looked on high at the fleecy sky--
440,III,And I thought the look was the last.
441,III,
442,III,But by the will that knows no law
443,III,"I wrenched my right hand free,"
444,III,And I drove my mandauw’s gleaming point
445,III,A hand’s-breadth in his knee.
446,III,
447,III,"Stung by the pain he loosened,"
448,III,"And a moment bared his breast,"
449,III,And like the dash of the lightning flash
450,III,My weapon sought its rest.
451,III,
452,III,As a log in the Moeroeng rapids
453,III,"The mighty chieftain rolled,"
454,III,"And I pinned him fast for the head-stroke,"
455,III,In the reek of the blood-stained mold.
456,III,
457,III,And I pinned him fast for the head-stroke--
458,III,But the glare of the dying eyes
459,III,Gleamed forth to show the worthy foe
460,III,And the heart that never dies.
461,III,
462,III,*       *       *       *       *
463,III,
464,III,"A moment toward a kampong,"
465,III,"And toward a kampong maid,"
466,III,I looked ... and a head rolled helpless
467,III,To the crash of a falling blade.
468,III,
469,III,
470,IV,IV
471,IV,
472,IV,With strips from my torn jacket
473,IV,"I bound my arm and thigh,"
474,IV,And I headed back o’er the leafy track
475,IV,With hope and spirits high.
476,IV,
477,IV,And as I sped with leaping heart
478,IV,All Nature seemed to sing;
479,IV,And my legs ran red where trickling bled
480,IV,The head of the Jungle King.
481,IV,
482,IV,The purring tree-tops called me--
483,IV,The fleecy clouds rolled by--
484,IV,"And the forest green was a sun-shot sheen,"
485,IV,And the sky was a laughing sky.
486,IV,
487,IV,"And only night could halt me,"
488,IV,"And the stars in their proud parade,"
489,IV,They bade me look to the path before
490,IV,That led to the kampong maid.
491,IV,
492,IV,"Bleeding and torn, spent and worn,"
493,IV,"At last I reached the hill,"
494,IV,Whence each hearth-light in the falling night
495,IV,Was a welcome bright and still.
496,IV,
497,IV,For each hearth-light in the falling night
498,IV,Cut clear through the growing gloam--
499,IV,Of all brave things the best that brings
500,IV,The weary Wanderer home.
501,IV,
502,IV,"But the waiting watchers spied me,"
503,IV,And met me as I ran;
504,IV,"And they saw the head of the chieftain,"
505,IV,And they hailed me man and man.
506,IV,
507,IV,But through the heart-whole greetings
508,IV,"I felt the anxious gaze,"
509,IV,And over my brain like a pall was lain
510,IV,The weight of the Doubter’s craze.
511,IV,
512,IV,And I begged them to tell me quickly--
513,IV,For I quailed at the story stayed--
514,IV,And I asked them if aught had happened
515,IV,To the head of the kampong maid.
516,IV,
517,IV,And there in the leafy gloaming--
518,IV,"Where the stars lit one by one,"
519,IV,They told me the tale at my homing--
520,IV,And I felt the passions run--
521,IV,
522,IV,Hate as the white-hot flame jet--
523,IV,Shame as the burning bar--
524,IV,Grief as the poisoned arrow--
525,IV,Revenge as the salted scar:
526,IV,
527,IV,Rankling--roaring--blinding--
528,IV,Rising and ebbing low;
529,IV,"Till overhead the skies burst red,"
530,IV,And I tottered beneath the blow.
531,IV,
532,IV,"For they told of a White Man’s coming,"
533,IV,And the weapon that carries far;
534,IV,And his love for the Maid--but over it laid
535,IV,The hush of the falling star.
536,IV,
537,IV,Faithlessness--treachery--cunning--
538,IV,Weakness and love and fear--
539,IV,"Oh very old was the tale they told,"
540,IV,Though born year by year.
541,IV,
542,IV,And I drew my blade and I leapt away--
543,IV,But they sprang and held me fast:
544,IV,"And they promised me there by the dead chief’s hair,"
545,IV,My hate should be filled to the last.
546,IV,
547,IV,And they showed me him bound and knotted
548,IV,"To the base of a splintered tree,"
549,IV,Stripped to the sun and spat upon
550,IV,And taunted--awaiting me.
551,IV,
552,IV,And I saw _her_ in the shadows--
553,IV,"But ... I might not know her, then--"
554,IV,A sneer for the kampong women--
555,IV,And a jest for the kampong men.
556,IV,
557,IV,*       *       *       *       *
558,IV,
559,IV,"And thus in the days of my strength and pride,"
560,IV,"From over the distant sea,"
561,IV,The White Man came in his open shame
562,IV,And stole my love from me.
563,IV,
564,IV,
565,V,V
566,V,
567,V,The next morn at the rising sun
568,V,"The tom-toms roared their fill,"
569,V,And echoed like rolling thunder
570,V,From hill to farthest hill.
571,V,
572,V,And the birds of the jungle fluttered
573,V,"And lifted and soared away,"
574,V,And we dragged the fettered prisoner forth
575,V,To blink at the blinding day.
576,V,
577,V,Full length and naked on the ground
578,V,"We staked him foot and hand,"
579,V,And we laughed in glee as we watched to see
580,V,The pest of the jungle-land.
581,V,
582,V,Oh we laughed in glee as we watched to see
583,V,"The little leeches swing,"
584,V,End on end till they reached the flesh
585,V,"Of the prostrate, struggling Thing."
586,V,
587,V,Like river flies in the summer rains
588,V,They covered the White Man o’er--
589,V,"Body and legs and arms and face,"
590,V,Till the whole was a bleeding sore.
591,V,
592,V,And the red streams ran from the crusted pools
593,V,"And crimsoned the leafy ground,"
594,V,And the scent of gore but brought the more
595,V,As the smell of game to the hound.
596,V,
597,V,"Hour by hour I watched him die,"
598,V,"Slowly day by day,"
599,V,Hour by hour I watched the flesh
600,V,Sinking and turning gray:
601,V,
602,V,Hour by hour I heard him shriek
603,V,To the skies and the White Man’s God--
604,V,But only the gluttons came again
605,V,And reddened the reeking sod.
606,V,
607,V,"Weeping, writhing, groaning--"
608,V,Paled to an ashen dun--
609,V,And the clotted blood turned black as mud
610,V,And stunk in the midday sun.
611,V,
612,V,(Bones where stretched the tautening flesh--
613,V,"A shining, yellow sheen--"
614,V,And the flies that helped the leeches work
615,V,In the stagnant pools between.)
616,V,
617,V,*       *       *       *       *
618,V,
619,V,Till the fourth day broke in a blaze of gold--
620,V,And I knew the end was nigh--
621,V,"And I called the tribes from near and far,"
622,V,To watch the White Man die.
623,V,
624,V,From every kampong of the south
625,V,Where the broad Barito winds--
626,V,From every kampong of the east
627,V,The murmuring hill-wind finds--
628,V,
629,V,From every kampong of the west
630,V,Where the Djoeloi falls and leaps--
631,V,From every kampong of the north
632,V,Where the great Mohakkam sweeps--
633,V,
634,V,From east and west and south and north
635,V,"The mighty warriors came,"
636,V,To prove the weight of the Dyak hate
637,V,And the shame of the naked shame.
638,V,
639,V,In noiseless scorn and wonder
640,V,"They scanned the victim there,"
641,V,Except that when an Elder spake
642,V,To mock at his despair.
643,V,
644,V,Or when from out the long-house--
645,V,Where loosened footboards creaked--
646,V,A woman leaned in frenzy
647,V,And tore her hair and shrieked.
648,V,
649,V,And from the wooded hill-tops
650,V,"The answering echoes came,"
651,V,Till all our far-flung wilderness
652,V,Stooped down to curse his name.
653,V,
654,V,"In sullen, savage silence"
655,V,They watched the streamlets flow:
656,V,"In savage, sullen silence--"
657,V,The war-lords--row on row--
658,V,
659,V,"Ranged around by rank and years,"
660,V,"Oh goodly was the sight,"
661,V,Square shouldered--spare--with muscles bare
662,V,Coiled in their knotted might--
663,V,
664,V,And little serpent eyes that gleamed
665,V,"In glittering, primal hate,"
666,V,"Like adders, that beneath the leaves"
667,V,The coming foot falls wait.
668,V,
669,V,The shrunken heads about their belts
670,V,"Stared with senseless grin,"
671,V,As though in voiceless mummery
672,V,They mocked him in his sin.
673,V,
674,V,As though in sightless greeting--
675,V,To make his entry good
676,V,To th’ lost and leering legion
677,V,Of the martyred brotherhood.
678,V,
679,V,*       *       *       *       *
680,V,
681,V,We rubbed his lips with costly salt--
682,V,(You know how far it comes)--
683,V,And when he called for drink--we laughed--
684,V,And rolled the Sick-man’s Drums.
685,V,
686,V,*       *       *       *       *
687,V,
688,V,They beckoned me unto his side--
689,V,The blood-stench filled the dell--
690,V,They asked me--“Ye are satisfied?”
691,V,And I answered--“It is well.”
692,V,
693,V,The final glaze was settling fast--
694,V,The weary struggles ceased--
695,V,And on his breath was the moan of death
696,V,That prayed for life released.
697,V,
698,V,So we propped his mouth wide open
699,V,"With a knob of rotten vine,"
700,V,And the leeches entered greedily
701,V,As white men to their wine.
702,V,
703,V,"Palate and roof and tongue and gums,"
704,V,They gushed in rivers gay--
705,V,And gasping--his own blood choked him--
706,V,And his Spirit passed away.
707,V,
708,V,_This is the tale the old chief tells
709,V,"When the western gold-belt dies,"
710,V,And the jungle trees in the evening breeze
711,V,"Tower against the skies,"
712,V,And the good-wife bakes the greasy cakes
713,V,Where the kampong hearth-fires rise._

1399,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1400,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1401,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,The Outbound Trail--The Outbound Trail--
1402,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,We hear it calling still:
1403,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Coralline bight where the waves churn white--
1404,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Ocean and plain and hill:
1405,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Jungle and palm--where the starlit calm
1406,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,The Wanderer’s loves fulfil.
1407,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1408,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Where the bleak, black blizzards blinding sweep"
1409,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Across the crumpled floe,"
1410,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the Living Light makes white the night
1411,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Above the boundless snow,"
1412,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the sentinel penguins watch the waste
1413,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Where the whale and the walrus go:
1414,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1415,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Where the phosphor fires flash and flare
1416,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Along the bellowing bow,"
1417,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the soft salt breeze of the Southern Seas
1418,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Is sifting across the prow,"
1419,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"And the glittering Cross in the blue-black sky,"
1420,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,The Watcher of Then and Now:
1421,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1422,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,We’ll lift again the lineless plain
1423,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Where the deep-cut rivers run--
1424,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the pallid peaks as the eagle seeks
1425,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,His crag when the day is done:
1426,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the rose-red glaciers glance and gleam
1427,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,In the glow of the setting sun.
1428,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1429,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,We’ll go once more to a farther shore--
1430,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,We’ll track the outbound trail;
1431,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Harbor and hill where the World stands still--
1432,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Where the strange-rigged fishers sail--
1433,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"And only the tune of the tasseled fronds,"
1434,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Like the moan of a distant gale.
1435,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1436,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,We’ll tramp anew the jungle through
1437,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Where ferned Pitcairnias rise,"
1438,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the softly fanned Tjemaras stand
1439,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"Green lace against the skies,"
1440,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,And the last red ray of the tropic day
1441,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Flickers and flares and dies.
1442,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,
1443,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"_Across the full-swung, shifting seas"
1444,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,"There comes a beck’ing gleam,"
1445,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Strong as the iron hand of Fate--
1446,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Sweet as a lover’s dream.
1447,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,What can bind us--what can keep us--
1448,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Who shall tell us nay?
1449,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,When the Outbound Trail is calling us--
1450,THE OUTBOUND TRAIL,Is calling us away._

1457,THE FOOL,
1458,THE FOOL,In the first gray dawn of history
1459,THE FOOL,A Paleolithic man
1460,THE FOOL,Observed an irate mammoth--
1461,THE FOOL,Observed how his neighbors ran:
1462,THE FOOL,And he sat on a naked boulder
1463,THE FOOL,"Where the plains stretched out to the sun,"
1464,THE FOOL,And jowl in hand he frowned and planned
1465,THE FOOL,As none before had done.
1466,THE FOOL,
1467,THE FOOL,"Next day his neighbors passed him,"
1468,THE FOOL,"And still he sat and thought,"
1469,THE FOOL,"And the next day and the next day,"
1470,THE FOOL,But never a deed was wrought.
1471,THE FOOL,Till the fifth sun saw him flaking
1472,THE FOOL,Some flint where the rocks fall free--
1473,THE FOOL,And the sixth sun saw him shaping
1474,THE FOOL,A shaft from a fallen tree.
1475,THE FOOL,
1476,THE FOOL,Enak and Oonak and Anak
1477,THE FOOL,"And their children and kith and kin,"
1478,THE FOOL,"They paused where they watched him working,"
1479,THE FOOL,"And they smiled and they raised the chin,"
1480,THE FOOL,And they tapped their foreheads knowingly--
1481,THE FOOL,As you and I have done--
1482,THE FOOL,But he--he had never a moment
1483,THE FOOL,To mark their mocking fun.
1484,THE FOOL,
1485,THE FOOL,And Enak passed on to bury
1486,THE FOOL,His brother the mammoth slew.
1487,THE FOOL,"And Oonak, to stay his starving,"
1488,THE FOOL,With his fingers grubbed anew.
1489,THE FOOL,"And Anak, he thought of his tender spouse"
1490,THE FOOL,An ichthyosaurus ate--
1491,THE FOOL,Because in seeking the nearest tree
1492,THE FOOL,She had reached it a trifle late.

1494,THE FOOL,*       *       *       *       *
1495,THE FOOL,
1496,THE FOOL,"Around the Council fire,"
1497,THE FOOL,"More beast and ape than man,"
1498,THE FOOL,"The hairy hosts assembled,"
1499,THE FOOL,And their talk to the crazed one ran.
1500,THE FOOL,"And they said, “It is best that we kill him"
1501,THE FOOL,"Ere he strangle us in the night,"
1502,THE FOOL,Or brings on our head the curse of the dead
1503,THE FOOL,When the thundering heavens light.
1504,THE FOOL,
1505,THE FOOL,“It is best that we rid our caverns
1506,THE FOOL,Of neighbors such as these--
1507,THE FOOL,It is best--” but the Council shuddered
1508,THE FOOL,At the rustle of parting leaves.
1509,THE FOOL,Out of the primal forest
1510,THE FOOL,Straight to their midst he strode--
1511,THE FOOL,Weathered and gaunt--but they gave no taunt--
1512,THE FOOL,As he flung to the ground his load.
1513,THE FOOL,
1514,THE FOOL,They eyed them with suspicion--
1515,THE FOOL,The long smooth shafts and lean:
1516,THE FOOL,They felt of the thong-bound flint barbs--
1517,THE FOOL,They saw that the work was clean.
1518,THE FOOL,"Like children with a plaything,"
1519,THE FOOL,"When first it is understood,"
1520,THE FOOL,They leapt to their feet and hurled them--
1521,THE FOOL,And they knew that the act was good.
1522,THE FOOL,
1523,THE FOOL,They pictured the mighty mammoth
1524,THE FOOL,"As the hurtling spear shafts sank,"
1525,THE FOOL,They pictured the unsuspecting game
1526,THE FOOL,Down by the river’s bank;
1527,THE FOOL,They pictured their safe-defended homes--
1528,THE FOOL,They pictured the fallen foe....
1529,THE FOOL,"And the Fool they led to the highest seat,"
1530,THE FOOL,Where the Council fires glow.

1572,THE FIRST POET,"There came from a Northern Land,"
1573,THE FIRST POET,A man with tales of the spouting whales
1574,THE FIRST POET,And the Lights that the ice-winds fanned.
1575,THE FIRST POET,
1576,THE FIRST POET,"And they sat them ’round on the barren ground,"
1577,THE FIRST POET,"And they clicked their spears to the time,"
1578,THE FIRST POET,And they lingered each on the golden speech
1579,THE FIRST POET,Of the man with the words that rhyme.
1580,THE FIRST POET,
1581,THE FIRST POET,With the words that rhyme like the rolling chime
1582,THE FIRST POET,"Of the tread of the rhythmic sea,"
1583,THE FIRST POET,And silent they listened with eyes that glistened
1584,THE FIRST POET,In savage ecstasy.
1585,THE FIRST POET,
1586,THE FIRST POET,Over the plain as a pall was lain
1587,THE FIRST POET,"The hand of the primal heart,"

1589,THE FIRST POET,The first faint glimmering Start.
1590,THE FIRST POET,
1591,THE FIRST POET,"As a ray of light in the storm-lashed night,"
1592,THE FIRST POET,O’er the virgin forests swept
1593,THE FIRST POET,From the star-staked sea the Symbols Three--
1594,THE FIRST POET,And the cave-men softly wept.
1595,THE FIRST POET,
1596,THE FIRST POET,Softly wept as slowly crept
1597,THE FIRST POET,"To the depth of the savage brain,"
1598,THE FIRST POET,"Honor, forsooth, and Faith and Truth--"
1599,THE FIRST POET,And they rose from the rock-rimmed plain--
1600,THE FIRST POET,
1601,THE FIRST POET,And in twos and threes ’neath the mammoth trees
1602,THE FIRST POET,They whispered as children do:

1620,THE TEST,

1622,THE TEST,His children slowly passed Him--
1623,THE TEST,And for the sweat upon the brow
1624,THE TEST,"And scar upon the cheek,"
1625,THE TEST,He heaped the burdens higher--
1626,THE TEST,He cut and smote and lashed them--
1627,THE TEST,And as they swayed and tottered
1628,THE TEST,He hurled them spent and weak.
1629,THE TEST,

1638,THE TEST,
1639,THE TEST,At last He took the Test-Tubes

2485,THE NEW BARD,They had sung the song how very long
2486,THE NEW BARD,Of Love and Faith and Truth:
2487,THE NEW BARD,"And they polished fine till it ran as wine,"
2488,THE NEW BARD,With never a spot uncouth.
2489,THE NEW BARD,
2490,THE NEW BARD,Mellow it spread with softened tread
2491,THE NEW BARD,To the beat of the perfect time--
2492,THE NEW BARD,Chastened and blest and colorless
2493,THE NEW BARD,"In stilted, vapid rhyme."
2494,THE NEW BARD,
2495,THE NEW BARD,Songs of love that the angels above
2496,THE NEW BARD,Laughed as they bended near--

2500,THE NEW BARD,Till a stronger people rising--
2501,THE NEW BARD,"They cast the cant aside,"

2505,THE NEW BARD,For there lifted free from the open sea
2506,THE NEW BARD,"The voice of a bard who knew,"
2507,THE NEW BARD,And he brought them tales from the spouting whales
2508,THE NEW BARD,Where only the lean gulls flew.
2509,THE NEW BARD,
2510,THE NEW BARD,And he brought them tales from the coral bight

2694,THE MASTERPIECE,
2695,THE MASTERPIECE,

2697,THE MASTERPIECE,We gazed each priceless gem--
2698,THE MASTERPIECE,Jordäens--Rubens--Raphael--
2699,THE MASTERPIECE,We paused and pondered them.
2700,THE MASTERPIECE,
2701,THE MASTERPIECE,"The famous, same Madonnas--"
2702,THE MASTERPIECE,The fatuous forms at ease--
2703,THE MASTERPIECE,And the Wedding Feast with Cavaliers--

2705,THE MASTERPIECE,
2706,THE MASTERPIECE,"We saw the Sistine Mother,"
2707,THE MASTERPIECE,The farthest Nations know--
2708,THE MASTERPIECE,Till room on room of light and gloom

2710,THE MASTERPIECE,
2711,THE MASTERPIECE,And some we knew and reverenced--
2712,THE MASTERPIECE,Whose praise the wide World sings;
2713,THE MASTERPIECE,And some we fled with callous dread
2714,THE MASTERPIECE,For flat and flaccid things.
2715,THE MASTERPIECE,
2716,THE MASTERPIECE,Till at last at the gallery’s ending
2717,THE MASTERPIECE,"In the room with the roof-let door,"
2718,THE MASTERPIECE,We saw a young man standing--

2721,THE MASTERPIECE,"Lithe and strong and supple,"
2722,THE MASTERPIECE,"Clean-limbed, clear-eyed and tall--"

2726,THE MASTERPIECE,And we saw the widowed Mother--
2727,THE MASTERPIECE,"And the prostrate, sobless grief;"
2728,THE MASTERPIECE,"And the pitying priest beside her,"
2729,THE MASTERPIECE,"And the gentle, vain relief."
2730,THE MASTERPIECE,
2731,THE MASTERPIECE,And the Sister--standing--watching--
2732,THE MASTERPIECE,"’Twixt love, reproach and tears--"

3173,SPAIN,"O’er the pavements of Sevilla,"
3174,SPAIN,Where the Grandees pass again
3175,SPAIN,To ogle in the balconies
3176,SPAIN,The matchless eyes of Spain.
3177,SPAIN,
3178,SPAIN,Once more the somersaulting bells
3179,SPAIN,In the great square tower ring--
3180,SPAIN,Once more the sword and cowl draw back--
3181,SPAIN,“The King--make way--The King!”
3182,SPAIN,Sevilla--Mother of a world
3183,SPAIN,"Of pride and golden gain,"

3191,SPAIN,"The long white beach, the swaying palms’"
3192,SPAIN,Shifting silver sheen--
3193,SPAIN,And the flickering flares of the flimsy fleet
3194,SPAIN,Where the spear-poised fishers lean.
3195,SPAIN,
3196,SPAIN,"The low-hung, skimming scuppers--"
3197,SPAIN,The flaunting skull and bones--

3206,SPAIN,Caressing heart and brain:

3209,SPAIN,The fluttering fan--the furtive glance--
3210,SPAIN,The black mantilla’s reign--
3211,SPAIN,And the Captains bold who drop their gold
3212,SPAIN,To bask in the eyes of Spain.
3213,SPAIN,
3214,SPAIN,The towering galleons plunging
3215,SPAIN,Thrice-tiered above the foam:
3216,SPAIN,"The ringing round-shot roaring,"
3217,SPAIN,And the crash of the hit gone home:
3218,SPAIN,"The yard-arms staggering under,"
3219,SPAIN,"Where, scorning the iron rain"
3220,SPAIN,"And showing its fangs to a parting world,"
3221,SPAIN,Goes down the Lion of Spain.

3226,SPAIN,With the stress of its strident call--

3779,THE DYAK CHIEF      13.,"characteristic building, is anywhere from fifty to two or three hundred"
3780,THE DYAK CHIEF      13.,"feet in length, elevated, on poles, from eight to twenty feet in the"
3781,THE DYAK CHIEF      13.,air. The sides of the houses are of rough boards or of bark and the
3782,THE DYAK CHIEF      13.,roofs usually of bark shingles. The age of the dwellings can be told by
3783,THE DYAK CHIEF      13.,"the height they stand above the ground, those on the highest poles being"
3784,THE DYAK CHIEF      13.,"the oldest ones, because of the former greater savagery of, and more"
