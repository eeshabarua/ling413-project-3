54,MUSE AND MINT,"I mused upon the strangeness of all things,"
55,MUSE AND MINT,So different from the dream
56,MUSE AND MINT,Whereof the morning mounted up on wings
57,MUSE AND MINT,Above the world agleam
58,MUSE AND MINT,With light that trembled into life and love
59,MUSE AND MINT,As when a censer swings
60,MUSE AND MINT,And joy of promise sings--
61,MUSE AND MINT,“The dream whereof
62,MUSE AND MINT,The gleam above
63,MUSE AND MINT,The world is love!”
64,MUSE AND MINT,
65,MUSE AND MINT,"Oh, bitterness to muse and neither find"
66,MUSE AND MINT,The beauty of the Muse
67,MUSE AND MINT,Nor yet the music which the soul divined
68,MUSE AND MINT,Ere set the rosy hues
69,MUSE AND MINT,In sombre lines that disenchant and fret
70,MUSE AND MINT,The heart with growing grief
71,MUSE AND MINT,Which struggles for relief--
72,MUSE AND MINT,"“O Muse, but let"
73,MUSE AND MINT,My spirit yet
74,MUSE AND MINT,The rue forget!”
75,MUSE AND MINT,
76,MUSE AND MINT,"As if to answer me a little child,"
77,MUSE AND MINT,To whom the sunshine’s glint
78,MUSE AND MINT,"Was gloom forever, on the corner smiled"
79,MUSE AND MINT,"And vended sprigs of mint,"
80,MUSE AND MINT,As though there were in blindness still a bloom
81,MUSE AND MINT,And fragrance which could reach
82,MUSE AND MINT,The passer-by and teach--
83,MUSE AND MINT,“In glint or gloom
84,MUSE AND MINT,There’s mint in bloom
85,MUSE AND MINT,To earth perfume!”

321,FIREFLIES,The Summer shower after;
322,FIREFLIES,A distant dog’s staccato bark
323,FIREFLIES,Disturbed the strollers’ laughter;
324,FIREFLIES,"The mournful whip-poor-will’s lament,"
325,FIREFLIES,The frogs’ and crickets’ chorus
326,FIREFLIES,"A weird, sepulchral feeling lent"
327,FIREFLIES,To meadow-lot and morass.
328,FIREFLIES,
329,FIREFLIES,A thousand insect-lanterns flashed
330,FIREFLIES,Their phosphorescent signals
331,FIREFLIES,Of living sparks that dot-and-dashed
332,FIREFLIES,Out swift electric riddles;
333,FIREFLIES,For scarcely was the eye upon
334,FIREFLIES,A single tiny glowlight
335,FIREFLIES,"When wink, it flitted and was gone"
336,FIREFLIES,Like prankish imp on show-night!
337,FIREFLIES,
338,FIREFLIES,And while one guessed its next surprise
339,FIREFLIES,Afar from where it dwindled
340,FIREFLIES,A myriad others to the eyes
341,FIREFLIES,All intercrossed and kindled
342,FIREFLIES,Until the ghostly gloom became
343,FIREFLIES,Illumined with manœuvres
344,FIREFLIES,As though of fairies fanning flame
345,FIREFLIES,Within a park of lovers.
346,FIREFLIES,
347,FIREFLIES,And thus does fancy people night
348,FIREFLIES,With fugitive creations
349,FIREFLIES,Of phantom-folk whose fitful light
350,FIREFLIES,Yet feeds our inspirations
351,FIREFLIES,And teaches us there is no dark
352,FIREFLIES,But fellowships the presence
353,FIREFLIES,Of every soul that sheds its spark
354,FIREFLIES,Of humble incandescence.

404,PEEP-OF-DAWN,Intoxicated senses sink

430,THE RILLY RIVER,And now the vivid greeneries cling
431,THE RILLY RIVER,"Along the margin lush and fallow,"
432,THE RILLY RIVER,And where were sombre deeps and chills
433,THE RILLY RIVER,Are silver trills of rippling rills.
434,THE RILLY RIVER,
435,THE RILLY RIVER,The loiterer upon the bridge
436,THE RILLY RIVER,Which o’er the eddying river poises
437,THE RILLY RIVER,Salutes the island’s sandy ridge
438,THE RILLY RIVER,That reappears; the eye rejoices
439,THE RILLY RIVER,In all the old familiar frills
440,THE RILLY RIVER,And saucy spills of rippling rills.
441,THE RILLY RIVER,
442,THE RILLY RIVER,The rod and reel the rapture feel
443,THE RILLY RIVER,"And from the boat take finny chances,"
444,THE RILLY RIVER,But less for luck than with the keel
445,THE RILLY RIVER,To be a part of runic dances;
446,THE RILLY RIVER,For thus the river’s music thrills
447,THE RILLY RIVER,Like joy that fills the rippling rills.

475,CHERRIES,Gettin’ ready bill and legs

479,CHERRIES,Cherries! Cherries! Cherries!
480,CHERRIES,The robins are excited and delighted--

702,WHEN I SURVEY,
703,WHEN I SURVEY,What! Call this Night and our small dial Day

2408,THE FLYING JACK,
2409,THE FLYING JACK,
2410,THE FLYING JACK,The sky was blue and smiling down
2411,THE FLYING JACK,Upon a human sea;
2412,THE FLYING JACK,"Old Glory fluttered, danced and shone"
2413,THE FLYING JACK,In varicolored glee.
2414,THE FLYING JACK,
2415,THE FLYING JACK,A merry breeze went laughing through
2416,THE FLYING JACK,The laughing folds of silk
2417,THE FLYING JACK,Until the red and white and blue
2418,THE FLYING JACK,Were sylphs with teeth of milk.
2419,THE FLYING JACK,
2420,THE FLYING JACK,Yet not for them the rapturous eyes
2421,THE FLYING JACK,"Of shouting crowds were bright,"
2422,THE FLYING JACK,Who came to hail with praise and prize
2423,THE FLYING JACK,The hero winged for flight.
2424,THE FLYING JACK,
2425,THE FLYING JACK,"“The first to fly,” the challenge read,"
2426,THE FLYING JACK,“Shall win the wreath and cup.”
2427,THE FLYING JACK,He spread his pinions and o’erhead
2428,THE FLYING JACK,A dizzy height went up.
2429,THE FLYING JACK,
2430,THE FLYING JACK,“Bravo! Bravo!” they shouted as
2431,THE FLYING JACK,He spiralled down and down;
2432,THE FLYING JACK,Then surged toward him in a mass
2433,THE FLYING JACK,And wreathed him with the crown.
2434,THE FLYING JACK,
2435,THE FLYING JACK,He smiled and in his eyes of blue
2436,THE FLYING JACK,And on his cheeks of red
2437,THE FLYING JACK,A something noble came to view
2438,THE FLYING JACK,As gallantly he said:
2439,THE FLYING JACK,
2440,THE FLYING JACK,"“The cup I’ll keep, the wreath I’ll place"
2441,THE FLYING JACK,Where it by right belongs;
2442,THE FLYING JACK,The first to fly my hand shall grace
2443,THE FLYING JACK,And you acclaim with tongues.”
2444,THE FLYING JACK,
2445,THE FLYING JACK,So saying towards his ship he stepped
2446,THE FLYING JACK,"And set the sails again,"
2447,THE FLYING JACK,Then in a rising circle swept
2448,THE FLYING JACK,With sun-kissed face and plane.
2449,THE FLYING JACK,
2450,THE FLYING JACK,They wondered when they saw him rise
2451,THE FLYING JACK,Toward the streamered staff
2452,THE FLYING JACK,Until he grazed its middle thrice
2453,THE FLYING JACK,And cleared it with a laugh;
2454,THE FLYING JACK,
2455,THE FLYING JACK,Until above its gilded ball
2456,THE FLYING JACK,He steadied and from high
2457,THE FLYING JACK,The trophy flung before them all
2458,THE FLYING JACK,With practised hand and eye.
2459,THE FLYING JACK,
2460,THE FLYING JACK,Upon Old Glory’s head the wreath
2461,THE FLYING JACK,Fell true and with it fell
2462,THE FLYING JACK,The airman’s words to those beneath
2463,THE FLYING JACK,Who needed but their spell:
2464,THE FLYING JACK,
2465,THE FLYING JACK,“The first to fly above our land
2466,THE FLYING JACK,On wings that never lag
2467,THE FLYING JACK,"I crown with patriotic hand,"
2468,THE FLYING JACK,Our country’s starry flag!”
2469,THE FLYING JACK,
2470,THE FLYING JACK,"And then he doffed his cap and lo,"
2471,THE FLYING JACK,A jackie’s suit he wore
2472,THE FLYING JACK,"As circling still he cried, “Oho,"
2473,THE FLYING JACK,I’ve flown in peace and war!”
2474,THE FLYING JACK,
2475,THE FLYING JACK,I rubbed my eyes and all was fled
2476,THE FLYING JACK,Except the silken folds
2477,THE FLYING JACK,Of Glory floating overhead

2680,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"Be that however as it may,"
2681,NICODEMUS BOGGS,To Demus ’twas a sign;
2682,NICODEMUS BOGGS,So forthwith he began to pray
2683,NICODEMUS BOGGS,And talk of things divine.
2684,NICODEMUS BOGGS,
2685,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Of course ’twas given him to know
2686,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Without a studied mind;
2687,NICODEMUS BOGGS,His tongue was loosened and the flow
2688,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Of words left wit behind.
2689,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Yet strange to say no church was moved
2690,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"His parish to become,"
2691,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Though Demus said it only proved
2692,NICODEMUS BOGGS,The church was deaf and dumb.
2693,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"For certainly the call was plain,"
2694,NICODEMUS BOGGS,As often half-asleep
2695,NICODEMUS BOGGS,He heard the selfsame voice again
2696,NICODEMUS BOGGS,In solemn tones and deep
2697,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Urge
2698,NICODEMUS BOGGS,----“Nicodemus! Nic-o-de-mus!
2699,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Nic-o-de-mus-s Bog-g-s!”
2700,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Although there were some folks blasphemous
2701,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Who said ’twas only frogs.
2702,NICODEMUS BOGGS,
2703,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"Be that as each opined, ’tis sure"
2704,NICODEMUS BOGGS,With Demus soon it turned
2705,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"To ague, and the only cure"
2706,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"For flesh which froze or burned,"
2707,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"The doctor ordered, was to drain"
2708,NICODEMUS BOGGS,The hollow in the rear
2709,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Where Demus lived; for while in vain
2710,NICODEMUS BOGGS,He followed his career
2711,NICODEMUS BOGGS,"Of human welfare, there had lain"
2712,NICODEMUS BOGGS,The most neglected near.
2713,NICODEMUS BOGGS,’Twas remedied and ne’er again
2714,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Did Nicodemus hear
2715,NICODEMUS BOGGS,The voice which had become so famous
2716,NICODEMUS BOGGS,For back-door croaks and frogs
2717,NICODEMUS BOGGS,Call
2718,NICODEMUS BOGGS,----“Nicodemus! Nic-o-de-mus!

2775,A FORGIVENESS,"Before the Gate of Paradise, and cast"
2776,A FORGIVENESS,His staff aside triumphantly to press
2777,A FORGIVENESS,"Within the dreamed-of goal. But strange to say,"
2778,A FORGIVENESS,It did not open to his eagerness
2779,A FORGIVENESS,As knocking he solicited the way.
2780,A FORGIVENESS,
2781,A FORGIVENESS,"“Nay,” said the Guardian Angel of the Gate,"
2782,A FORGIVENESS,"“The proof of thy assurance I await,"
2783,A FORGIVENESS,The sesame and heavenliest word
2784,A FORGIVENESS,"That passes here! Three trials shalt thou have,"
2785,A FORGIVENESS,And if thou hast not found it by the third
2786,A FORGIVENESS,No privilege to enter canst thou crave.”
2787,A FORGIVENESS,
2788,A FORGIVENESS,So sure the Pilgrim was the truest right
2789,A FORGIVENESS,Must be the one of evangelic might
2790,A FORGIVENESS,He quickly answered “LOVE!”
2791,A FORGIVENESS,The Angel’s wing
2792,A FORGIVENESS,"Drooped o’er his countenance as he replied,"
2793,A FORGIVENESS,"“Nay, such a plea might any sinner bring"

2795,A FORGIVENESS,
2796,A FORGIVENESS,“Canst thou not to the name come closer yet
2797,A FORGIVENESS,Of Goodness’ greatest key?”
2798,A FORGIVENESS,The Pilgrim let
2799,A FORGIVENESS,His thoughts go outward in a second quest
2800,A FORGIVENESS,"And slowly made response, “Why, then, ’tis GRACE,"
2801,A FORGIVENESS,"The covenant and seal of all the rest,"
2802,A FORGIVENESS,The chain whose lock is Love.”
2803,A FORGIVENESS,The Angel’s face
2804,A FORGIVENESS,Was still compassionate as he withheld
2805,A FORGIVENESS,"The entrance, and his pity would have spelled"
2806,A FORGIVENESS,The password in his eyes as he again
2807,A FORGIVENESS,"Made answer, “Grace is truly all our hope"
2808,A FORGIVENESS,"In promise and fulfilment, but ’tis when"
2809,A FORGIVENESS,We lay it to our hearts the Gate we ope
2810,A FORGIVENESS,And our admission most divinely plead;
2811,A FORGIVENESS,For none can think the word but feels its need
2812,A FORGIVENESS,And healing touch.”
2813,A FORGIVENESS,"The Pilgrim’s brow grew sad,"
2814,A FORGIVENESS,But as he pondered to his knees he fell
2815,A FORGIVENESS,And rose as oft before in wonder glad--
2816,“FORGIVENESS!”,“FORGIVENESS!”
2817,“FORGIVENESS!”,"The Angel answered, “Well!”"
2818,“FORGIVENESS!”,And stood aside to let him pass.

3104,DESIGN,The universe of rolling spheres
3105,DESIGN,Is not for Deity’s display

3109,DESIGN,"Its mass that in momentum sweeps,"

3111,DESIGN,The order which its system keeps

3120,DESIGN,He-Over-All doth manifest
3121,DESIGN,A greater power than that which whirls
3122,DESIGN,"Them on their way at its behest,"
3123,DESIGN,
3124,DESIGN,A greater purpose than to span
3125,DESIGN,The Heavens by His glory lit;
3126,DESIGN,For ’tis the more eternal plan
3127,DESIGN,Of making all creation fit
3128,DESIGN,
3129,DESIGN,For fellowship with Nature’s God
3130,DESIGN,"In higher terms of wisdom, truth"

3552,THE MAN-BIRD,On ears too tense--yet ever on
3553,THE MAN-BIRD,"O’er blinding South and blasting North,"
3554,THE MAN-BIRD,Triumphant up or headlong down!
3555,THE MAN-BIRD,
3556,THE MAN-BIRD,"Ten thousand feet on high, ye gods,"
3557,THE MAN-BIRD,Man tries conclusions for your realm
3558,THE MAN-BIRD,And gambles life at daring odds
3559,THE MAN-BIRD,To ride above the storm-strewn fleece;
3560,THE MAN-BIRD,A modern Jason at the helm
3561,THE MAN-BIRD,By siren lured like him of Greece
3562,THE MAN-BIRD,To desperate hazard; yet to fail
3563,THE MAN-BIRD,One pulse-beat for a thrilling glance--
3564,THE MAN-BIRD,"Ah, well the boldest might turn pale"
3565,THE MAN-BIRD,And choose ’twixt glory and mischance!
3566,THE MAN-BIRD,
3567,THE MAN-BIRD,"A moment poised the avian,"
3568,THE MAN-BIRD,Then earthward swooped as never Jove
3569,THE MAN-BIRD,Rode down the vault of superman.
3570,THE MAN-BIRD,"Wind-surges roared and clouds fled by,"
3571,THE MAN-BIRD,Death raced beside and demons strove
3572,THE MAN-BIRD,To wrench one slender part or ply;
3573,THE MAN-BIRD,"But flawless-sinewed, man and steed"
3574,THE MAN-BIRD,"Came flashing, wheeling down and down"
3575,THE MAN-BIRD,With thrice a Roman courser’s speed
3576,THE MAN-BIRD,To earth and conqueror’s renown.
3577,THE MAN-BIRD,

3582,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3583,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3584,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,What knows the world of battles? History writes
3585,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,The deeds of men with blood and triumph hails
3586,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"As trophy of their valor, armament"
3587,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Or better fortune, thinking he who fights"
3588,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,With surer odds or tactics seldom fails
3589,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,In the last holocaust of war’s event.
3590,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3591,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Impassioned eyes see not the shadow-shapes
3592,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"That hover on the flank of charging hosts,"
3593,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Ready to launch themselves as chance array;
3594,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Not one of all the mustered lines escapes
3595,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,When mockery’s phantom centauri the boasts
3596,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Of martial pride downtrample and dismay.
3597,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3598,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Ah, Waterloo! where scarred battalions strove"
3599,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"And overwhelmed each other, blood-imbrued,"
3600,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Hurling their troops with savage impotence--
3601,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,The conquering cavalry which o’er thee drove
3602,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Was not the one the Corsican reviewed,"
3603,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Nor yet the Iron Duke with grimmer sense.
3604,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3605,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Ah, Gettysburg! whose murderous brigades"
3606,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Met in the shambles of a horror-hell
3607,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Or rushed like demons in the jaws of death--
3608,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Thy most resistless riders were the shades
3609,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Of other erstwhile terribles who fell
3610,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Drawing the sword from its envenomed sheath.
3611,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3612,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,In vain each other’s throats the blue and grey
3613,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Sprang at like wolves of Winter mad for flesh,"
3614,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,And yet unsated till the kill-lust leaped
3615,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,In exultation’s shout of victory!
3616,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Not all thy columns veteran or fresh
3617,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Could save the field by grisly corpses heaped
3618,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3619,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Against the spectral squadron which outrode
3620,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Both Fighting Phil and Morgan’s Men alike,"
3621,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,As on the Battle’s flank it weirdly hung
3622,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Or where the Dragon’s Teeth of Hate were sowed
3623,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Sprang up as Headless Horsemen armed to strike
3624,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,And crumple back the charge by fury flung.
3625,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3626,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"They loomed like apparitions, terror-born,"
3627,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Yet ghastly real and dreadly sinister,"
3628,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Abreast of every vanguard and redoubt;
3629,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,O’er trench and belching gun they swept in scorn
3630,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Or carried panic to the broken rear
3631,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Till all was carnage, cowardice and rout."
3632,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3633,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Invincible formations, onsets’ surge"
3634,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"Of vengeance’ boldest fiends, manœuvres dire"
3635,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,With compassing destruction--all before
3636,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,The grewsome legionaries’ mounted charge
3637,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Were swept like chaff by maelstrom wind and fire
3638,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,And rose again in prowess nevermore.
3639,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,
3640,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,But on the ghost-troop galloped as of old
3641,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"In every bloody battle, never dead"
3642,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,And never yet defeated; phantoms still
3643,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,"That gallop, gallop o’er the mortal mould"
3644,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,Of every tragic battlefield once red
3645,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,With madmen’s life-blood at their country’s will!
3646,THE PHANTOM CAVALRY,

3653,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"Thou callest me thy human brother; well,"
3654,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Am I less flesh and spirit than thyself
3655,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Or less entitled so to humbly dwell
3656,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,In honest peace and plenty that to delve
3657,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Is equally as noble as to draw
3658,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,From the rich depths digged up? Or is the law
3659,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Of brotherhood pretense?--Our separate lots
3660,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"But differ as our make, not as our meed."
3661,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Do brothers share according to their thoughts
3662,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Or in the rough according to their need?
3663,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,If thou dost think thee finer in the end
3664,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"Than him thou flatterest, thou art no friend."
3665,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,
3666,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Thou callest me thy brother and dost praise
3667,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"My struggle to get even, holding fast"
3668,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"Thyself the odds of vantage, so the race"
3669,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Is to the swift and strong--and he is last
3670,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Whose toiling body forged the chariot-wheel
3671,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,That rolls thee on to fortune. It were base
3672,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"To make the difference one of feast and fast,"
3673,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,Of full and empty measure of our weal;
3674,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,For I am he who’s spent--the spender thou;
3675,THOU CALLEST ME BROTHER,"Yet thou dost call me brother! Heaven, how?"

3682,THE SINGING DEATH,
3683,THE SINGING DEATH,"Men whisper low of spectres, calibans"
3684,THE SINGING DEATH,"And curses almost devilish with doom,"
3685,THE SINGING DEATH,"Mysterious fiends like hellhounds, werwolves, ghouls"
3686,THE SINGING DEATH,And other nameless shapes as jinns and janns
3687,THE SINGING DEATH,That spring from demon-haunts and skulk or loom
3688,THE SINGING DEATH,To terror-stricken fancy of weak souls.
3689,THE SINGING DEATH,
3690,THE SINGING DEATH,"But none have named the scourge of Singing Death,"
3691,THE SINGING DEATH,The dread reality which out of hell
3692,THE SINGING DEATH,Comes forth as often as the blood-lust burns;
3693,THE SINGING DEATH,Foulness and fury volcanize its breath
3694,THE SINGING DEATH,"As, ravening for flesh insatiate, fell"
3695,THE SINGING DEATH,"It swoops, devours and bloodier returns."
3696,THE SINGING DEATH,
3697,THE SINGING DEATH,An army gathers flushed with high resolve
3698,THE SINGING DEATH,And there is martial music and display
3699,THE SINGING DEATH,Of glory ominous with human fate;
3700,THE SINGING DEATH,For ere the dial shall again revolve
3701,THE SINGING DEATH,The Singing Death exultantly will prey
3702,THE SINGING DEATH,Upon the host till horror outdoes hate.
3703,THE SINGING DEATH,
3704,THE SINGING DEATH,A floating citadel superbly steers
3705,THE SINGING DEATH,"Her ocean-course with victory-flags unfurled,"
3706,THE SINGING DEATH,Alike to sea and foe invincible;
3707,THE SINGING DEATH,Yet somewhere from the blue as she careers
3708,THE SINGING DEATH,The Singing Death by Titan forces hurled
3709,THE SINGING DEATH,Will scream above her decks with damning knell.
3710,THE SINGING DEATH,
3711,THE SINGING DEATH,Hark! Hear you it like vomit from the throat
3712,THE SINGING DEATH,"Of Hades hurtling through the sulphurous air,"
3713,THE SINGING DEATH,"With cross between the moan of Manes’ wraith,"
3714,THE SINGING DEATH,The torture of Inferno and the note
3715,THE SINGING DEATH,Of vulture-torn Prometheus’ despair?
3716,THE SINGING DEATH,Ah! ’Tis the cannon missile’s Singing Death!
3717,THE SINGING DEATH,
3718,THE SINGING DEATH,It plays no diapason as the roar
3719,THE SINGING DEATH,"It leaves behind where thunders loud intone,"
3720,THE SINGING DEATH,Nor as the mighty swell of organ-reeds;
3721,THE SINGING DEATH,"But all the stops of battle rising o’er,"
3722,THE SINGING DEATH,It shrieks its way to finish with the groan
3723,THE SINGING DEATH,Of mortal agony where valor bleeds.
3724,THE SINGING DEATH,
3725,THE SINGING DEATH,"It sings not as a master for applause,"
3726,THE SINGING DEATH,With perfect-voiced-and-chested range of gift
3727,THE SINGING DEATH,Till song becomes the triumph of all time;
3728,THE SINGING DEATH,"But, rather, ’tis a dirge which discord flaws"
3729,THE SINGING DEATH,With time’s infernal arts lest God uplift
3730,THE SINGING DEATH,The world by love to Peace’s choir sublime.

3757,THE OLD MOON IN THE ARMS OF THE NEW,
3758,THE OLD MOON IN THE ARMS OF THE NEW,A sickly sickle frames
