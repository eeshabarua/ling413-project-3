135,CONTENTS,
136,CONTENTS,
137,CONTENTS,"Oh, beautiful petunias, how lovely you grow,"
138,CONTENTS,"Some purple, some crimson and some white as snow;"
139,CONTENTS,"Your colors are like the rainbow bending o’er,"
140,CONTENTS,And your scent comes into my windows and door.
141,CONTENTS,
142,CONTENTS,"Your seeds were so tiny, I scarce could conceive,"
143,CONTENTS,"When you came up profusely, one can hardly believe"
144,CONTENTS,"That blossoms like these, such wee little mites"
145,CONTENTS,Could produce in my garden such wonderful sights.
146,CONTENTS,
147,CONTENTS,"When once you are planted when Spring comes around,"
148,CONTENTS,Multiplied by hundreds you’d peep through the ground;
149,CONTENTS,"Awaiting the heat, the Sun and the rain"
150,CONTENTS,In the sweet early summer to grow lovely again.
151,CONTENTS,
152,CONTENTS,"You come every year, you make my heart glad"
153,CONTENTS,"With such beautiful blossoms, how can I be sad?"
154,CONTENTS,"The humming bird loves you, they come every day"
155,CONTENTS,"And drink of your nectar, so softly and gay."
156,CONTENTS,
157,CONTENTS,Even the bee gets much of his sweetness from you
158,CONTENTS,"In the early morning--your petals with dew,"
159,CONTENTS,"And hover around you; your blossoms they love,"
160,CONTENTS,As you hold up your faces to Heaven above.
161,CONTENTS,
162,CONTENTS,"The Autumn is coming, with its wind and cold;"
163,CONTENTS,"Again down to earth will you enfold,"
164,CONTENTS,That in the Spring your strength may return;

170,CONTENTS,A Tribute to Thirty-Second Street.
171,CONTENTS,
172,CONTENTS,
173,CONTENTS,"Just south of the heart of this Great Midwest Town,"
174,CONTENTS,Is the dearest little street I ever have known;
175,CONTENTS,"The homes are kept up with pride and care,"
176,CONTENTS,And the lawns with beautiful flowers rare;
177,CONTENTS,"Years have been many for some of us here,"
178,CONTENTS,On this little street that we all hold so dear.
179,CONTENTS,
180,CONTENTS,"Our children were wee things when we came out here,"
181,CONTENTS,"But now all is changed; some are gone, some are near;"
182,CONTENTS,But our children’s children have come to bless;
183,CONTENTS,It’s a gift from Heaven--such love to possess;
184,CONTENTS,"Were our children so sweet, so glad and so merry,"
185,CONTENTS,"With cheeks like rose buds, and lips like the cherry."
186,CONTENTS,
187,CONTENTS,"The trees were but saplings, when we came out here,"
188,CONTENTS,"From the Sun have protected us many a year,"
189,CONTENTS,"And have grown up so high their branches meet,"
190,CONTENTS,And form a cathedral nave over the street;
191,CONTENTS,"And the birds in the mornings, their anthems to heav’n raise,"
192,CONTENTS,’Til you would think their throats would burst in their praise.
193,CONTENTS,
194,CONTENTS,"This little street lies between Main and McGee,"
195,CONTENTS,"Out on Thirty-second. Do come, and see."
196,CONTENTS,"If I say that I love you, believe me, it’s true,"
197,CONTENTS,And so do the neighbors think a great deal of you.
198,CONTENTS,"When I have been away and return, then I see"
199,CONTENTS,You’re like an old sweetheart welcoming me.
200,CONTENTS,
201,CONTENTS,
202,CONTENTS,
203,CONTENTS,
204,CONTENTS,You Greenhorn.
205,CONTENTS,
206,CONTENTS,
207,CONTENTS,"Vacation is over, school opens today;"
208,CONTENTS,"Pleasures are laid aside, no time for play;"
209,CONTENTS,"But your happy children, who the language know,"
210,CONTENTS,It makes it much easier to school to go.
211,CONTENTS,
212,CONTENTS,"When I was a child in the first primer class,"
213,CONTENTS,I knew not the language--was a shy little lass;
214,CONTENTS,For we had only a few months before
215,CONTENTS,Arrived in this country from cold Bergen’s shore.
216,CONTENTS,
217,CONTENTS,"I remember so well, the first day my ma took me"
218,CONTENTS,To school; how I trembled and blushed I still see.
219,CONTENTS,"The sweet lady teacher took me by the hand,"
220,CONTENTS,And said in a short time I would understand.
221,CONTENTS,
222,CONTENTS,"She patted my cheek; oh, how happy was I"
223,CONTENTS,To have found a friend--I wanted to cry
224,CONTENTS,"For happiness, only the world seemed so cold,"
225,CONTENTS,Although I was less than seven years old.
226,CONTENTS,
227,CONTENTS,"A boy of my own age, across the aisle,"
228,CONTENTS,Ev’ry now and then would look at me and smile;
229,CONTENTS,"Then after school, he came to my side;"
230,CONTENTS,"“You Greenhorn; you Greenhorn,” loudly he cried."
231,CONTENTS,
232,CONTENTS,"I ran home like a deer--for I felt such shame,"
233,CONTENTS,"This, the first day in school, and be called a bad name."
234,CONTENTS,"I tip-toed quietly and whispered in mother’s ear,"
235,CONTENTS,For I didn’t want little sister such naughty words to hear.
236,CONTENTS,
237,CONTENTS,"But after this day, I had never a fear,"
238,CONTENTS,For she said little fairies are always near
239,CONTENTS,"To protect little children from danger they keep,"
240,CONTENTS,Even at night when they are asleep.
241,CONTENTS,
242,CONTENTS,
243,CONTENTS,
244,CONTENTS,
245,CONTENTS,Baby.
246,CONTENTS,
247,CONTENTS,
248,CONTENTS,"I’m just a little baby, I pray you let me sleep;"
249,CONTENTS,"Please let me have my own way, for I don’t want to weep."
250,CONTENTS,"I love to lay and stretch, of Heav’n I love to think,"
251,CONTENTS,That sunny home I came from; just one more little wink.
252,CONTENTS,
253,CONTENTS,"Don’t take me in your arms, and keep on rocking me;"
254,CONTENTS,"That I should be a good child, no reason I can see;"
255,CONTENTS,"Don’t sing so loud, my pink ears are tender little things,"
256,CONTENTS,But like a little goldfinch a-flopping of its wings.
257,CONTENTS,
258,CONTENTS,"Don’t kiss me on my lips, do kiss me on my hair;"
259,CONTENTS,"And, if you’ll turn my head around you’ll find a bald spot there;"
260,CONTENTS,"And when folks come to call, then please don’t dress me up"
261,CONTENTS,"In that long white dress, that’s starched from the bottom up"
262,CONTENTS,to the top.
263,CONTENTS,
264,CONTENTS,And use a soft cloth on my face;
265,CONTENTS,It need not be of finest lace.
266,CONTENTS,"And don’t come near my nose or eyes,"
267,CONTENTS,Dat’s why little folks like me cries;
268,CONTENTS,"But lay me tenderly in my crib to rest,"
269,CONTENTS,"To grow, and coo--I love that best."

274,CONTENTS,Jack’s Christmas.
275,CONTENTS,
276,CONTENTS,
277,CONTENTS,"Santa is coming, now Jack, go to bed;"
278,CONTENTS,"It’s freezing outdoors, so cover your head."
279,CONTENTS,"The wind is howling, the ground is all white,"
280,CONTENTS,"’Twill be a real Christmas, it may snow all night."
281,CONTENTS,"Poor Santa will come, with a bound and a hop,"
282,CONTENTS,For he has great stores in his big Christmas shop.
283,CONTENTS,"He has rocking horses, balls and tops galore;"
284,CONTENTS,"The better the boy, so much the more"
285,CONTENTS,"Will he get, for Santa loves good boys--none that are bad."
286,CONTENTS,
287,CONTENTS,"Dear mamma, I fink I’ve been a good boy,"
288,CONTENTS,"Yes, precious, you are your mother’s great joy;"
289,CONTENTS,"So now go to sleep, my darling, my Jack,"
290,CONTENTS,"I just heard a noise; oh, Santa, go back,"
291,CONTENTS,"And come in the morning, for sleep he needs more"
292,CONTENTS,Than all the fine toys in Santa’s great store;
293,CONTENTS,"And she tells of the Christ Child, so humble, so sweet,"
294,CONTENTS,"That was born in a manger, Hail Thee, we greet."
295,CONTENTS,
296,CONTENTS,"In the morning, Jack woke up and rubbed his blue eyes;"
297,CONTENTS,"I fink this is surely a great big surprise,"
298,CONTENTS,"I never ’spected a tree, with lights red and blue,"
299,CONTENTS,"A sled and some mittens, nuts, and candy, too;"
300,CONTENTS,I dest love old Santa; but I dreamed I had found
301,CONTENTS,"A dear little playmate, wif cheeks red and round,"
302,CONTENTS,"All bundled up in your old blue shawl,"
303,CONTENTS,"Without any hair, dest like a big doll;"
304,CONTENTS,"Wish I could see Santa; oh, please, call him back,"
305,CONTENTS,And say he forgot a playmate for Jack.

309,CONTENTS,
310,CONTENTS,Is Marriage a Failure?
311,CONTENTS,
312,CONTENTS,
313,CONTENTS,"Marriage is a problem, at least, so I have heard,"
314,CONTENTS,"I hope you’ll kindly listen, for I, too, have a word;"
315,CONTENTS,But it was God’s own making; He ne’er can do a wrong;
316,CONTENTS,"He deals with us so gently, we know not He is among"
317,CONTENTS,Us when we are merely thinking; His Hand is not far away
318,CONTENTS,To guide us to His wishes; though all seems bright as day.
319,CONTENTS,
320,CONTENTS,"Before you take the leap, think carefully and well;"
321,CONTENTS,"Don’t be in any hurry, it may mean quite a spell."
322,CONTENTS,"Then, if you think a partner would to your blessings add,"
323,CONTENTS,A home and little children to love and to make glad;
324,CONTENTS,"Then make your resolutions, to stand while life shall last,"
325,CONTENTS,"’Tis but human to err, forgive all that is past."
326,CONTENTS,
327,CONTENTS,"Though times be turbulent at first, forget it with a smile,"
328,CONTENTS,"And say softly to yourself, ’twill be better after while;"
329,CONTENTS,Should either of you argue about a pretty face
330,CONTENTS,"At home, all sanctified with love, is wholly out of place."
331,CONTENTS,"What care I if the Sun is gray or blue or red,"
332,CONTENTS,"All desires for argument, for love of you has fled."
333,CONTENTS,
334,CONTENTS,"If you are not blest with worldly goods, you may be blest with health,"
335,CONTENTS,For this I deem far greater than all your pompous wealth.
336,CONTENTS,"Your home should be your palace, if it be great or small,"
337,CONTENTS,And have sweet flowers blooming in the spring and in the fall;
338,CONTENTS,"A little trelliced nook, with creeping vines around,"
339,CONTENTS,"Where the heart is ever glad to come, and where true love is found."
340,CONTENTS,
341,CONTENTS,"A man loves his home, a smile his path to cheer,"
342,CONTENTS,"A few sweet spoken words, how easy and how clear;"
343,CONTENTS,"And little arms a-twining around his great big heart,"
344,CONTENTS,To kiss and caress him--this is your happy part.
345,CONTENTS,"To love and to be loved, what greater happiness is there,"
346,CONTENTS,"And all these will be yours, if you’ll see it right and square."
347,CONTENTS,
348,CONTENTS,"The days of bleak December, with its hoary white and gray,"
349,CONTENTS,"A blessed little grandchild, do come with me and play;"
350,CONTENTS,"To you the name of mother is given from above,"
351,CONTENTS,"With little arms a-twining, sweet innocents of love."
352,CONTENTS,"No, marriage is not a failure. I’m simply here to prove"
353,CONTENTS,A home so full of sweetness is sanctified by love.
354,CONTENTS,
355,CONTENTS,"But it was God’s own making, He ne’er has done a wrong,"
356,CONTENTS,"He deals with us so gently, we know not He is among"
357,CONTENTS,"Us when we’re merely thinking, His hand is not far away"

367,CONTENTS,"Oh, do come down and be sweet to me;"
368,CONTENTS,"You have hung there so long, and have tempted my taste"

373,CONTENTS,"The rose blush began, when snow lay around,"

375,CONTENTS,
376,CONTENTS,"Your tree is so full, but none seems more fair,"
377,CONTENTS,Than this one that swings in the morning’s pure air;
378,CONTENTS,"I have touched the ones I could reach with my arm,"
379,CONTENTS,And fear for the storm that is coming to harm.
380,CONTENTS,
381,CONTENTS,"So come down, my love, your cheeks are so red;"
382,CONTENTS,"It’s you that I want, none other instead;"
383,CONTENTS,Come to your sweetheart--I’ll wipe off the dust;
384,CONTENTS,"Fall down in my lap, for have you I must."
385,CONTENTS,
386,CONTENTS,"I believe you are flirting, so high in the air,"
387,CONTENTS,The humming bird and butterfly can fly ’round you there.

410,CONTENTS,
411,CONTENTS,"And a story he can tell,"
412,CONTENTS,"Of the pussy cat that fell in the well,"
413,CONTENTS,"And of the children that were lost in the wood,"
414,CONTENTS,That ran from their home and never were good.
415,CONTENTS,"He can tell of the apple tree that grew so tall,"
416,CONTENTS,"Laden with fruit, that leaned on the wall;"
417,CONTENTS,"Then of the circus, oh, happy we,"
418,CONTENTS,For we are sure we will everything see.
419,CONTENTS,
420,CONTENTS,"And many more things, I tell you, ’tis so--"
421,CONTENTS,"For he knows more’n anybody, and ’ats true."
422,CONTENTS,"I fink I’ll marry grandpa, he pleases me so fine."
423,CONTENTS,The best ain’t ever good enough for me to dine.
424,CONTENTS,"Our own way we can have, when he comes to stay"
425,CONTENTS,To look after us and spend the day.
426,CONTENTS,
427,CONTENTS,"If our toys lay around on our very best floor,"
428,CONTENTS,And we pin pictures up on the walls and the door;
429,CONTENTS,"The noise that we make--we jump up and down,"
430,CONTENTS,"On our beautiful sofa, in our parlor of brown."
431,CONTENTS,"He didn’t say one teentsy bit a word,"
432,CONTENTS,"For he had a nap, and never has heard."
433,CONTENTS,He looks for his glasses--they are on his nose;
434,CONTENTS,Now this is a fine time for me to propose.
435,CONTENTS,"But mother came home, not one word did she say,"
436,CONTENTS,"Except, you have had a good time today."
437,CONTENTS,
438,CONTENTS,"When grandpa was gone, we could see by her looks,"
439,CONTENTS,Something that’s not often written in books.
440,CONTENTS,"We got scared as could be--we hustled around,"
441,CONTENTS,To put things back in the place we had found;
442,CONTENTS,"Now, mammy, don’t please say one word to dad,"
443,CONTENTS,For this was the best day we ever have had;
444,CONTENTS,"We wish you’d have grandpa come every day,"
445,CONTENTS,"Never to leave us, but come here to stay."

457,CONTENTS,"There’s Gerald needs shoes, his old ones are too bad,"
458,CONTENTS,"And an overcoat, a warm one, for the very best dad;"
459,CONTENTS,"There’s Peer, need’s a cap, to keep out the cold,"
460,CONTENTS,We have looked at one longingly--but it was sold.
461,CONTENTS,"And a big bisque doll, for our golden haired sister;"
462,CONTENTS,"Now please don’t forget us, I pray you, Kind Mister,"
463,CONTENTS,And don’t forget mother; now what does she need;
464,CONTENTS,"It seems to take all dad can make, us to feed,"
465,CONTENTS,"To keep out the cold, the snow is so deep;"
466,CONTENTS,"Amen, Kind Shepherd, I lay me to sleep."

468,CONTENTS,Santa (Yulenissen) had heard the prayers that he said;
469,CONTENTS,"At six Christmas Eve great bundles on the sofa were spread,"
470,CONTENTS,"First the feasting begins, on roast goose and almond rice,"
471,CONTENTS,Even those not as fortunate have everything nice.
472,CONTENTS,Then the candles are lit on the pine tree so bright;
473,CONTENTS,"It is indeed a most beautiful sight,"
474,CONTENTS,"Everyone joins hands and dance ’round the tree,"
475,CONTENTS,Singing old songs and laughing--such glee.
476,CONTENTS,Then when the colored lights are burning low
477,CONTENTS,The gifts are distributed with many an Oh!
478,CONTENTS,
479,CONTENTS,"Gifts were substantial, for fathers and mothers,"
480,CONTENTS,"And more than they prayed for these little brothers,"
481,CONTENTS,"Some skis and some skates, three pairs of glad eyes,"
482,CONTENTS,"So full of happiness and full of surprise,"
483,CONTENTS,"And a golden haired doll, with soft eyes of blue,"
484,CONTENTS,"Its new little mother lisped, prayers do come true."
485,CONTENTS,
486,CONTENTS,"This was Christmas Eve in Norway, not a great while ago;"
487,CONTENTS,"The land of glaciers, ice and snow;"
488,CONTENTS,Where reindeers pull Santa over mountains high.
489,CONTENTS,"Click, click through the ice covered fjords they fly,"
490,CONTENTS,"To visit the homes of the Norsemen, so hardy."
491,CONTENTS,"They understand, not one minute tardy,"
492,CONTENTS,
493,CONTENTS,"In furs he is wrapped, from his head to his feet,"

495,CONTENTS,"Sometimes folks ask Santa to come in and dine,"
496,CONTENTS,"A warm bowl of soup, or some red sparkling wine."
497,CONTENTS,
498,CONTENTS,The peasants he visits; there is rarely a year
499,CONTENTS,That he ever misses these children so dear.
500,CONTENTS,"He loves them because they are human and kind,"
501,CONTENTS,"And a more honest people, he knows, hard to find;"
502,CONTENTS,"The unfortunate are the ones he always loves best,"
503,CONTENTS,"For the rich, he knows, are already blest."
504,CONTENTS,
505,CONTENTS,"Should a tourist over the great mountains get lost,"

509,CONTENTS,"He is rubbing his hands, how cold the weather,"
510,CONTENTS,It is time we must go to kirke together;

675,CONTENTS,"Then she sits and holds me, while Bill leans on her knee,"

853,CONTENTS,"I guess I must wait till he really grows,"
854,CONTENTS,"And gets big like me--heaven only knows,"
855,CONTENTS,"I’ll just call up central, and tell her that we"
856,CONTENTS,Have a boy at our house--not big like me.
857,CONTENTS,
858,CONTENTS,"And I know she’ll be glad, for I called her up"
859,CONTENTS,"Sometime ago--I said, please don’t stop,"
860,CONTENTS,"But telephone to heaven, my number fifty-seven,"
861,CONTENTS,To send me a sister to earth from heaven.
862,CONTENTS,
863,CONTENTS,But I can’t understand that I ever was small
864,CONTENTS,"Like this little fellow, with cap, gown and all;"

878,CONTENTS,
879,CONTENTS,"How rich the scarlet of her lips,"
880,CONTENTS,Like the glory that the angel sips;
881,CONTENTS,"The contour of her lovely face,"
882,CONTENTS,Within the folds of priceless lace.
883,CONTENTS,
884,CONTENTS,"How glossy the masses of golden hair,"
885,CONTENTS,Divinely beautiful at the altar there;
886,CONTENTS,And her wondrous deep brown eyes--
887,CONTENTS,Surely she hails from Paradise.
888,CONTENTS,

898,CONTENTS,
899,CONTENTS,
900,CONTENTS,"There’s a birdie at our window,"
901,CONTENTS,Tapping just as if he knew
902,CONTENTS,There were happy little children
903,CONTENTS,Where the wind was blowing through;
904,CONTENTS,And they tapped and kept on tapping.
905,CONTENTS,Did they want to come inside?
906,CONTENTS,"Their little wings were flapping,"
907,CONTENTS,Open up your window wide.
908,CONTENTS,
909,CONTENTS,"And the children were so happy,"
910,CONTENTS,Just to see the birds fly in
911,CONTENTS,"Under shelter, under safety,"
912,CONTENTS,In the snow storm they had been;
913,CONTENTS,And we fed these little birdies
914,CONTENTS,With soft crumbs of whitest bread;
915,CONTENTS,"And they ate, these little sturdies,"
916,CONTENTS,Tempted them to go to bed.
917,CONTENTS,
918,CONTENTS,"In the morning, bright and early,"
919,CONTENTS,They were up before daylight;
920,CONTENTS,"And they said, peek-peek, to thank us"
921,CONTENTS,For the shelter of the night;
922,CONTENTS,Then we tho’t how birds must suffer
923,CONTENTS,In their nest of softest down;
924,CONTENTS,And we looked in a small corner
925,CONTENTS,Laid a little foot so brown.
926,CONTENTS,
927,CONTENTS,And no wonder they were tapping
928,CONTENTS,Tapping at our window pane;
929,CONTENTS,For the cruel wind had frozen
930,CONTENTS,Off its little foot--such pain.
931,CONTENTS,Then we thought how birds must suffer
932,CONTENTS,From the cold and from the snow;
933,CONTENTS,And we built a little bird house
934,CONTENTS,"That would keep them warm, we know."

948,CONTENTS,"I’ll be back to you shortly, by His will and His grace;"
949,CONTENTS,And today I’ll begin to look and to hear
950,CONTENTS,If his wandering feet are coming near.
951,CONTENTS,
952,CONTENTS,"My heart beats fast, for I hear a sound,"
953,CONTENTS,"The walk is like his, over the old ground,"
954,CONTENTS,"And a sound like one whistling--Oh, is it he?"
955,CONTENTS,"I falter; no, no; it cannot be."

1038,CONTENTS,
1039,CONTENTS,
1040,CONTENTS,Divorced.
1041,CONTENTS,
1042,CONTENTS,
1043,CONTENTS,"My divorce has been granted this very day,"
1044,CONTENTS,"With no one to scold, I can do what I may;"
1045,CONTENTS,"My heart seems to flutter, how happy I feel,"
1046,CONTENTS,It will take some time this great wound to heal.
1047,CONTENTS,
1048,CONTENTS,"My dear Mrs. Smith, good morning to you,"
1049,CONTENTS,"I have heard about a divorce, is it really true?"
1050,CONTENTS,"Well, I’m awfully sorry, now what can I do"
1051,CONTENTS,"To lessen your burden, for your children and you."
1052,CONTENTS,
1053,CONTENTS,"He seemed so proud of you, when you would go out"
1054,CONTENTS,"In the warm summer evenings, to ride about;"
1055,CONTENTS,Such love looks he’d give you; now how can this be
1056,CONTENTS,"To break up a home, I pray you, tell me."
1057,CONTENTS,
1058,CONTENTS,"It was this way, when I married him I didn’t know"
1059,CONTENTS,"How to cook or keep house, not even to sew;"
1060,CONTENTS,My parents were old--so it fell to me
1061,CONTENTS,"To help support them--now, do you see?"
1062,CONTENTS,
1063,CONTENTS,"I toiled and worked early and late,"
1064,CONTENTS,And nearly deplored my unfortunate fate.
1065,CONTENTS,"When I laid them away, I was left alone,"
1066,CONTENTS,"Friends I had few--oh, how I did mourn."
1067,CONTENTS,
1068,CONTENTS,"Then after a year he came into my life,"
1069,CONTENTS,"All was peace and harmony, no thought of strife;"
1070,CONTENTS,And blessings were added when our children came;
1071,CONTENTS,"The harder he worked, so anxious for fame."
1072,CONTENTS,
1073,CONTENTS,"Then, after a time, he was so hard to please;"
1074,CONTENTS,"In his presence I scarcely could feel at ease,"
1075,CONTENTS,"For I didn’t do one little thing for him right,"
1076,CONTENTS,Until I wished he was far out of sight.
1077,CONTENTS,
1078,CONTENTS,"And this thing kept on, it near drove me wild;"
1079,CONTENTS,I felt so small--just like a wee child;
1080,CONTENTS,I resented his words and told him that I
1081,CONTENTS,Would not live with him longer--and sooner would die.
1082,CONTENTS,
1083,CONTENTS,"He sneered and he laughed; yes, work for pay"
1084,CONTENTS,"From early till late, the whole blessed day;"
1085,CONTENTS,"I gave you this home, what more can I do;"
1086,CONTENTS,I have worked and worked for my children and you.
1087,CONTENTS,
1088,CONTENTS,When I would mention a trip in the summer to go
1089,CONTENTS,"Just anywhere, I’d say--you need it, you know,"
1090,CONTENTS,What nonsense he’d say; I’m well as can be;
1091,CONTENTS,"A vacation for me? Well, that I can’t see."
1092,CONTENTS,
1093,CONTENTS,"Well, that is the way we wrangled, till I"
1094,CONTENTS,Was so unhappy I wanted to fly;
1095,CONTENTS,"Perhaps this sounds trivial to you, but to me"
1096,CONTENTS,It seems as big as the great open sea.
1097,CONTENTS,
1098,CONTENTS,"But I understand, my dear little friend,"
1099,CONTENTS,"That he’s been to call, and some gifts did send;"
1100,CONTENTS,"And the great loads of coal he sent you last week,"
1101,CONTENTS,Surely you thanked him--some kind word did speak?
1102,CONTENTS,
1103,CONTENTS,"Yes, and he gave me this home; he provided well"
1104,CONTENTS,For his little family--I can safely tell
1105,CONTENTS,We never suffered for a want or a care
1106,CONTENTS,"When the time came around, it was always there."
1107,CONTENTS,
1108,CONTENTS,"Before I go, do call the children in,"
1109,CONTENTS,"It’s so long since I’ve seen them. Why, Minnie, how thin"
1110,CONTENTS,"You have grown; why, Charlie, how small"
1111,CONTENTS,And pale you are; do have your doctor call.
1112,CONTENTS,
1113,CONTENTS,"The boy’s fever was high--he calls in his pain,"
1114,CONTENTS,"Oh, papa, dear, papa, come kiss me again."
1115,CONTENTS,"The door softly opens, a lov’d voice in the hall,"
1116,CONTENTS,"In his arms he clasps her, his best friend, his all."
1117,CONTENTS,
1118,CONTENTS,"Years have passed; yes, truly, they are happy now;"
1119,CONTENTS,"The glad days of youth are gone, somehow,"
1120,CONTENTS,"But on her face a sweet smile is lingering there,"
1121,CONTENTS,And sweet contentment is found everywhere.
1122,CONTENTS,
1123,CONTENTS,And Charlie has grown to be straight and tall;
1124,CONTENTS,"And Min’s little one, the youngest of all,"
1125,CONTENTS,"Lies in his crib, such a sweet little lad"
1126,CONTENTS,That is watched over happily by grandma and grand-dad.
1127,CONTENTS,
1128,CONTENTS,
1129,CONTENTS,
1130,CONTENTS,
1131,CONTENTS,Mother.
1132,CONTENTS,
1133,CONTENTS,
1134,CONTENTS,"Mother, you nursed me at your breast,"
1135,CONTENTS,"And gave of yourself, your very best;"
1136,CONTENTS,"Your anxiety, care and watchful nights,"
1137,CONTENTS,When all was still you would turn on the lights
1138,CONTENTS,To see I was snugly covered in bed
1139,CONTENTS,Long after my little prayers were said.
1140,CONTENTS,
1141,CONTENTS,"When I went to school you would help me so much,"
1142,CONTENTS,When my lessons were hard--but your soft touch
1143,CONTENTS,"Would ease it all, for I leaned on your word,"
1144,CONTENTS,It was always the dearest I ever have heard;
1145,CONTENTS,"My heart beats fast, when I think how dear"
1146,CONTENTS,You always were to your children here.
1147,CONTENTS,
1148,CONTENTS,"Truth and obedience was always your aim,"
1149,CONTENTS,"Mother, mother, how fair is your name;"
1150,CONTENTS,"How grateful I am I can scarcely say,"
1151,CONTENTS,"Though you are gone away, far away,"
1152,CONTENTS,"Singing the Miserere, I still see you there,"
1153,CONTENTS,Rocking your child with tenderest care.
1154,CONTENTS,
1155,CONTENTS,"Mother love is strong, many a sorrow, many a tear;"
1156,CONTENTS,"When all else fails, her love is still there;"
1157,CONTENTS,And she’ll go to the end of the earth for you.
1158,CONTENTS,"So noble, so gentle--none kinder and true;"
1159,CONTENTS,"Yes, you were my first friend--why should I not love"
1160,CONTENTS,To pray for your soul that is called above.
1161,CONTENTS,
1162,CONTENTS,
1163,CONTENTS,
1164,CONTENTS,
1165,CONTENTS,Ascension Day.
1166,CONTENTS,
1167,CONTENTS,
1168,CONTENTS,"We sailed away one fair March day,"
1169,CONTENTS,From Norway’s shore so far away
1170,CONTENTS,To a new land; our hopes were high;
1171,CONTENTS,"Oh, what have we done; oh, my; oh, my;"
1172,CONTENTS,"Left father and mother and dear friends on shore,"
1173,CONTENTS,Perhaps never to see them more.
1174,CONTENTS,"We sailed and sailed many miles over the sea,"
1175,CONTENTS,And prayed God to protect my children and me.
1176,CONTENTS,
1177,CONTENTS,The icebergs surrounded our ship one night;
1178,CONTENTS,"The captain shouted no water in sight,"
1179,CONTENTS,"Like mountains around us, we are here to stay;"
1180,CONTENTS,"It may be a week, it may be a day."
1181,CONTENTS,"We looked at each other in mute horror and dread,"
1182,CONTENTS,"Should the days go by, who would give us bread?"
1183,CONTENTS,"Nearly three weeks went by, no help in sight,"
1184,CONTENTS,Each man was willing to do his mite.
1185,CONTENTS,
1186,CONTENTS,"At sunrise the captain called with a shout,"
1187,CONTENTS,"Out of these icebergs, we must get out;"
1188,CONTENTS,"I was up on the mast, I see water ahead;"
1189,CONTENTS,The sun is high and looks quite red;
1190,CONTENTS,"Today is Ascension Day, all come, kneel and pray"
1191,CONTENTS,That we will be out of here before close of day.
1192,CONTENTS,"Weeping and sobbing they knelt on the floor,"
1193,CONTENTS,And prayed as they never had prayed before.
1194,CONTENTS,
1195,CONTENTS,"Now, my men, get an ax or a saw, cut the ice;"
1196,CONTENTS,"Make a path for our ship. To work, time flies;"
1197,CONTENTS,"They labored untiringly for hours; ’twas hard work,"
1198,CONTENTS,"It meant much suffering if this work they should shirk,"
1199,CONTENTS,"Then when they were through, all panting and cold;"
1200,CONTENTS,They were drawn up by ropes into the ship’s hold.
1201,CONTENTS,
1202,CONTENTS,"Now, my men, be steady; shove with all your might;"
1203,CONTENTS,"For, if it’s God’s will, we will be in the light."
1204,CONTENTS,"The ship moves; what’s creaking; oh, what a roar;"
1205,CONTENTS,Today it’s life or death; what can be done more;
1206,CONTENTS,"Mothers clung to their children and clasped them real fast,"
1207,CONTENTS,"For this is a day of days, it may be the last."
1208,CONTENTS,The foghorn blows; I trembled with fear
1209,CONTENTS,"For my little ones and my husband, so dear."
1210,CONTENTS,
1211,CONTENTS,"I hugged them closely to my heart,"
1212,CONTENTS,"We are saved, we are saved, I heard with a start;"
1213,CONTENTS,"Do my ears hear aright; I laugh and I cry,"
1214,CONTENTS,For I was ready this day to die.
1215,CONTENTS,God heard our prayers; ah! can it be
1216,CONTENTS,That we are again sailing out on this wide sea?
1217,CONTENTS,"Such laughing, such shouting, no time to weep;"
1218,CONTENTS,Only to dance and sing; no time for sleep.
1219,CONTENTS,
1220,CONTENTS,"The dignified and glad captain took a hand in the game,"
1221,CONTENTS,From hearty congratulations his right arm was lame;
1222,CONTENTS,"But three hundred souls, with God’s help, he had saved"
1223,CONTENTS,From the towering bergs and a briny grave.
1224,CONTENTS,
1225,CONTENTS,*       *       *       *       *
1226,CONTENTS,
1227,CONTENTS,"This really happened in April, 1865, in the northern part of the"
1228,CONTENTS,Atlantic ocean. The ship was an old fashioned sailing vessel and under
1229,CONTENTS,ordinary circumstances would have required three to four weeks time from
1230,CONTENTS,"Bergen, Norway, to Montreal, Canada."
1231,CONTENTS,
1232,CONTENTS,Passengers were compelled to carry enough bread for their entire
1233,CONTENTS,"families, to last for the whole trip, which of course, would become hard"
1234,CONTENTS,"and dry. Many icebergs have nearly vertical walls, often more than one"
1235,CONTENTS,hundred feet. These floating mountains of ice sometimes have very
1236,CONTENTS,"fantastic shapes. It is not safe for a ship to come near one, and it is"
1237,CONTENTS,no uncommon thing for an iceberg to suddenly turn upside down. How
1238,CONTENTS,things have changed since then! One can go the same distance in about
1239,CONTENTS,twelve days. We were seven weeks crossing at that time on account of the
1240,CONTENTS,anxious and terrible stay in the icebergs.
1241,CONTENTS,
1242,CONTENTS,I’m glad to be here in this great land and to tell you this story of my
1243,CONTENTS,youth.
1244,CONTENTS,
1245,CONTENTS,
1246,CONTENTS,
1247,CONTENTS,
1248,CONTENTS,Your Star.
1249,CONTENTS,
1250,CONTENTS,
1251,CONTENTS,How deep and wide the ocean;
1252,CONTENTS,No eye its depths hath seen
1253,CONTENTS,"What secrets there are hidden,"
1254,CONTENTS,Below the briny green.
1255,CONTENTS,
1256,CONTENTS,"There are numberless living creeping things,"
1257,CONTENTS,"Both great and small,"
1258,CONTENTS,"And mermaids, too, that sweetly sing;"
1259,CONTENTS,It’s Him that made them all.
1260,CONTENTS,
1261,CONTENTS,"Should you up in the heavens gaze,"
1262,CONTENTS,Their duplicates you’ll find;
1263,CONTENTS,"The world is still a closed book,"
1264,CONTENTS,Each living thing of every kind.
1265,CONTENTS,
1266,CONTENTS,"Yet do we ever think how weak,"
1267,CONTENTS,"How helpless, how small we are;"
1268,CONTENTS,"And as I sit and ponder,"
1269,CONTENTS,Are we likened to a star?
1270,CONTENTS,
1271,CONTENTS,
1272,CONTENTS,
1273,CONTENTS,
1274,CONTENTS,A Moth.
1275,CONTENTS,
1276,CONTENTS,
1277,CONTENTS,"A moth flew into my room last night,"
1278,CONTENTS,Where the flame turned all into gorgeous light;
1279,CONTENTS,It flew ’round about till it finally came
1280,CONTENTS,Too near; for it was a cruel flame
1281,CONTENTS,"And never stopped till it fell to the floor,"
1282,CONTENTS,Air seared and misshapen; it hopped to the door
1283,CONTENTS,"There it lay, breathing its last,"
1284,CONTENTS,For love of a flame its life was past.
1285,CONTENTS,
1286,CONTENTS,
1287,CONTENTS,
1288,CONTENTS,
1289,CONTENTS,Lonely.
1290,CONTENTS,
1291,CONTENTS,
1292,CONTENTS,"One day Nicodemus lay down and died,"
1293,CONTENTS,And his good little wifey cried and cried.
1294,CONTENTS,A few days after he was laid away
1295,CONTENTS,Under the sod--deep down in the clay.
1296,CONTENTS,
1297,CONTENTS,"The days were so long, how lonely was she,"
1298,CONTENTS,For he died in the autumn; not a green tree;
1299,CONTENTS,"She took out his clothes and brushed them so neat,"
1300,CONTENTS,And patched his pants right over the seat.
1301,CONTENTS,
1302,CONTENTS,"Then she called in a neighbor, and opened the door,"
1303,CONTENTS,And showed her the clothes Nicodemus “had wore;
1304,CONTENTS,And his poor old socks she broidered in brown;”
1305,CONTENTS,Such a good man was he--they weeping sat down.
1306,CONTENTS,
1307,CONTENTS,"When he was alive, I had so much to do,"
1308,CONTENTS,The days were so short I never got through;
1309,CONTENTS,"And when I get lonely, perhaps I have missed"
1310,CONTENTS,To put on a button or a patch I have kissed.
1311,CONTENTS,
1312,CONTENTS,
1313,CONTENTS,
1314,CONTENTS,
1315,CONTENTS,Playtime.
1316,CONTENTS,
1317,CONTENTS,
1318,CONTENTS,"Old age is the time to watch and pray,"
1319,CONTENTS,And to prepare for the coming day.
1320,CONTENTS,
1321,CONTENTS,"Your workday is over--rest and be glad,"
1322,CONTENTS,This is your playtime--do not be sad.
1323,CONTENTS,
1324,CONTENTS,"Your hair is turned from brown to gray,"
1325,CONTENTS,And the little ringlets softly play.
1326,CONTENTS,
1327,CONTENTS,"And hold a wee dear one close to your heart,"
1328,CONTENTS,Singing a lullaby--this is your part.
1329,CONTENTS,
1330,CONTENTS,And see the blue smoke curl over your head
1331,CONTENTS,From your golden meerschaum; gladness doth shed.

1408,CONTENTS,wanted her boy. So dad took his hopeful to her with great joy. Nothing
1409,CONTENTS,"has happened on this dear little street since the day that you left it,"
1410,CONTENTS,at least nothing great. The same neighbors sit on their porches at
1411,CONTENTS,"night, trying to find a breeze, perhaps a stray one, real light. I’ll"
1412,CONTENTS,close now and hope that these lines will fall into the hands of your
