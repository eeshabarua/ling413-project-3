511,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,They fight like scalded wildcats
512,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,When the least bit of fighting starts.
513,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"They drink, these belly-busting devils"

516,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,And never were such saints found.
517,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,They will give you their plug tobacco.
518,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,They will give you the shirts off their backs.
519,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"They will cry for your every sorrow,"
520,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Put ham in your haversacks.
521,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"And they feed the cuttlefishes, whales and skates"
522,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,With dates and figs in bales and crates:--
523,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"Shiploads of sweet potatoes, peanuts, rutabagas,"
524,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Honey in hearts of gourds:

536,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,St. Francis comes to his city at night
537,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,And stands in the brilliant electric light
538,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,And his swans that prophesy night and day
539,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Would soothe his heart that wastes away:
540,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,The giant swans of California
541,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,That nest on the Golden Gate
542,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,And beat through the clouds serenely
543,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,And on St. Francis wait.
544,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,But St. Francis shades his face in his cowl
545,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,And stands in the street like a lost grey owl.
546,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,He thinks of _gold_ ... _gold_.
547,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,He sees on far redwoods
548,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Dewfall and dawning:
549,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Deep in Yosemite

551,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,He hears from far valleys
552,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"Prayers by young Christians,"
553,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,He sees their due penance
554,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"So cruel, so cold;"
555,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"He sees them made holy,"
556,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,White-souled like young aspens
557,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,With whimsies and fancies untold:--

560,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"Whose eggs are like mosque domes of Ind,"
561,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Cry with curious notes
562,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,That their eggs are good for boats
563,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,To toss upon the foam and the wind.
564,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,He beholds on far rivers
565,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,The venturesome lovers
566,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Sailing for the sea
567,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,All night
568,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,In swanshells white.
569,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,He sees them far on the ocean prevailing
570,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,In a year and a month and a day of sailing
571,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,Leaving the whales and their whoop unfailing
572,THE GOLDEN WHALES OF CALIFORNIA,"On through the lightning, ice and confusion"

915,II,When the rigs in many a dusty line
916,II,"Jammed our streets at noon,"
917,II,And joined the wild parade against the power of gold.
918,II,
919,II,"We roamed, we boys from High School"
920,II,"With mankind,"

922,II,Silk-lined.
923,II,"Oh Tom Dines, and Art Fitzgerald,"

938,II,Oh we bucks from every Springfield ward!
939,II,Colts of democracy--
940,II,Yet time-winds out of Chaos from the star-fields of the Lord.
941,II,
942,II,The long parade rolled on. I stood by my best girl.
943,II,"She was a cool young citizen, with wise and laughing eyes."
944,II,"With my necktie by my ear, I was stepping on my dear,"
945,II,"But she kept like a pattern, without a shaken curl."
946,II,
947,II,She wore in her hair a brave prairie rose.
948,II,"Her gold chums cut her, for that was not the pose."
949,II,No Gibson Girl would wear it in that fresh way.
950,II,"But we were fairy Democrats, and this was our day."
951,II,
952,II,"The earth rocked like the ocean, the sidewalk was a deck."
953,II,The houses for the moment were lost in the wide wreck.
954,II,And the bands played strange and stranger music as they trailed along.
955,II,"Against the ways of Tubal Cain,"
956,II,"Ah, sharp was their song!"
957,II,"The demons in the bricks, the demons in the grass,"
958,II,"The demons in the bank-vaults peered out to see us pass,"
959,II,"And the angels in the trees, the angels in the grass,"
960,II,"The angels in the flags, peered out to see us pass."
961,II,"And the sidewalk was our chariot, and the flowers bloomed higher,"
962,II,"And the street turned to silver and the grass turned to fire,"
963,II,"And then it was but grass, and the town was there again,"
964,II,A place for women and men.
965,II,
966,II,
967,III,III
968,III,
969,III,Then we stood where we could see
970,III,"Every band,"
971,III,And the speaker’s stand.
972,III,And Bryan took the platform.
973,III,And he was introduced.
974,III,And he lifted his hand
975,III,And cast a new spell.
976,III,Progressive silence fell
977,III,"In Springfield,"
978,III,"In Illinois,"
979,III,Around the world.
980,III,Then we heard these glacial boulders across the prairie rolled:
981,III,“_The people have a right to make their own mistakes....
982,III,You shall not crucify mankind
983,III,Upon a cross of gold._”
984,III,
985,III,And everybody heard him--
986,III,In the streets and State House yard.
987,III,And everybody heard him
988,III,"In Springfield,"
989,III,"In Illinois,"
990,III,"Around and around and around the world,"
991,III,That danced upon its axis
992,III,And like a darling broncho whirled.

995,IV,IV
996,IV,
997,IV,"July, August, suspense."
998,IV,Wall Street lost to sense.
999,IV,"August, September, October,"
1000,IV,"More suspense,"
1001,IV,And the whole East down like a wind-smashed fence.

1003,IV,"Then Hanna to the rescue,"

1172,II,The little nation in her soul
1173,II,Bloomed in her girl’s prophetic face.
1174,II,"She named it not, and yet he felt"
1175,II,One challenge: her eternal race.
1176,II,"This was the mystery of her step,"
1177,II,Her trembling body’s sacred grace.
1178,II,
1179,II,"He stood, a priest, a Nazarite,"
1180,II,A rabbi reading by a tomb.
1181,II,The hardy raider saw and feared
1182,II,"Her white knees in the palace gloom,"
1183,II,Her pouting breasts and locks well combed
1184,II,"Within the humming, reeling room."
1185,II,
1186,II,Her name was _Meditation_ there:
1187,II,Fair opposite of bullock’s brawn.
1188,II,I sing her eyes that conquered him.
1189,II,"He bent before his little fawn,"
1190,II,"Her dewy fern, her bitter weed,"
1191,II,Her secret forest’s floor and lawn.
1192,II,
1193,II,He gave her Shushan[1] from the walls.
1194,II,"She saw it not, and turned not back."
1195,II,Her eyes kept hunting through his soul
1196,II,As one may seek through battle black
1197,II,"For one dear banner held on high,"
1198,II,For one bright bugle in the rack.
1199,II,
1200,II,The scorn that loves the sexless stars:
1201,II,Traditions passionless and bright:
1202,II,"The ten commands (to him unknown),"
1203,II,The pillar of the fire by night:--
1204,II,Flashed from her alabaster crown
1205,II,The while they kissed by candlelight.
1206,II,
1207,II,The rarest psalms of David came
1208,II,From her dropped veil (odd dreams to him).
1209,II,"It prophesied, he knew not how,"
1210,II,Against his endless armies grim.
1211,II,He saw his Shushan in the dust--
1212,II,Far in the ages growing dim.
1213,II,
1214,II,"Then came a glance of steely blue,"
1215,II,Flash of her body’s silver sword.
1216,II,Her eyes of law and temple prayer
1217,II,Broke him who spoiled the temple hoard.
1218,II,The thief who fouled all little lands
1219,II,"Went mad before her, and adored."
1220,II,
1221,II,"The girl was Eve in Paradise,"
1222,II,"Yet Judith, till her war was won."
1223,II,All of the future tyrants fell
1224,II,"In this one king, ere night was done,"
1225,II,"And Israel, captive then as now"
1226,II,Ruled with tomorrow’s rising sun.
1227,II,
1228,II,And in the logic of the skies
1229,II,"He who keeps Israel in his hand,"
1230,II,The God whose hope for joy on earth
1231,II,"The Gentile yet shall understand,"
1232,II,Through powers like Esther’s steadfast eyes
1233,II,Shall free each little tribe and land.

1267,I,"You ever looked upon were in my sight,"
1268,I,That I had stood up in your royal car

1270,I,
1271,I,"To see young David, leading forth his sheep,"

1311,III,
1312,III,"You were his tree of incense and his feast,"

1415,I,"Near the only printing presses known to man,"
1416,I,Young Confucius walks the shore
1417,I,On a sorrowful day.
1418,I,"The town, all books, is tumbling down"
1419,I,Through the blue bay.
1420,I,The book-worms writhe
1421,I,From rusty musty walls.

1433,I,Confucius hears a carol and a hum:

1436,I,"Then, in an instant bows the reverent knee--"

1472,III,"One thankful day,"
1473,III,For Galahad sails back at last
1474,III,To Camelot Bay.
1475,III,The _pure_ knight lands and tells the tale:
1476,III,“Far in the east
1477,III,"A sea-girl led us to a king,"
1478,III,"The king to a feast,"
1479,III,"In a land where poppies bloom for miles,"
1480,III,Where books are made like bricks and tiles.
1481,III,I taught that king to love your name--
1482,III,Brother and Christian he became.
1483,III,
1484,III,“His Town of Thunder-Powder keeps

1487,III,
1488,III,“His Town of Cheese the mouse affrights

1492,III,(And deep and ancient is the dust.)
1493,III,
1494,III,“All towns have one same miracle
1495,III,"With the Town of Silk, the capital--"
1496,III,Vast book-worms in the book-built walls.
1497,III,Their creeping shakes the silver halls;
1498,III,"They look like cables, and they seem"
1499,III,Like writhing roots on trees of dream.
1500,III,"Their sticky cobwebs cross the street,"
1501,III,"Catching scholars by the feet,"
1502,III,"Who own the tribes, yet rule them not,"
1503,III,Bitten by book-worms till they rot.
1504,III,Beggars and clowns rebel in might
1505,III,Bitten by book-worms till they fight.”
1506,III,
1507,III,Arthur calls to his knights in rows:
1508,III,“I will go if Merlin goes;
1509,III,These rebels must be flayed and sliced--
1510,III,Let us cut their throats for Christ.”
1511,III,But Merlin whispers in his beard:
1512,III,“China has witches to be feared.”
1513,III,
1514,III,Arthur stares at the sea-foam’s rim
1515,III,Amazed. The fan-girl beckons him!--
1516,III,That slender and peculiar child
1517,III,Mongolian and brown and wild.
1518,III,"His eyes grow wide, his senses drown."
1519,III,"She laughs in her wing, like the sleeve of a gown."
1520,III,She lifts a key of crimson stone:
1521,III,“The Great Gunpowder-town you own.”
1522,III,She lifts a key with chains and rings:
1523,III,“I give the town where cats have wings.”
1524,III,She lifts a key as white as milk:
1525,III,“This unlocks the Town of Silk”--
1526,III,Throws forty keys at Arthur’s feet:
1527,III,“These unlock the land complete.”
1528,III,
1529,III,"Then, frightened by suspicious knights,"
1530,III,"And Merlin’s eyes like altar-lights,"
1531,III,"And the Christian towers of Arthur’s town,"
1532,III,She spreads blue fins--she whirs away;
1533,III,"Fleeing far across the bay,"
1534,III,Wailing through the gorgeous day:
1535,III,“My sick king begs
1536,III,That you save his crown
1537,III,And his learnèd chiefs from the worm and clown--
1538,III,The Empire of China is crumbling down.”

1548,IV,Bonaparte finds beside his throne
1549,IV,"One evening, laughing in her wing,"
1550,IV,"The Chinese sea-child; and she cries,"
1551,IV,Breaking his heart with emerald eyes
1552,IV,And fairy-bred unearthly grace:
1553,IV,"“Master, take your destined place--"
1554,IV,Across white foam and water blue
1555,IV,The streets of China call to you:
1556,IV,The Empire of China is crumbling down.”
1557,IV,"Then he bends to kiss her mouth,"
1558,IV,"And gets but incense, dust and drouth."

1596,V,In the ancient way;
1597,V,"Officials, futile as of old,"

1607,V,Now fade and glare
1608,V,Ten thousand towns with book-tiled roof
1609,V,"And garden-stair,"
1610,V,Where beggars’ babies come like showers
1611,V,Of classic words:

1619,V,She soars; she claws his patient face--

2277,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,Though not very bashful and not very bold
2278,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,He had reached the plain conclusion his passion must be told.
2279,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"And so he sang: “Awake, awake,”--this hip-hoo-rayious man."
2280,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"“Do you like me, do you love me, Polly Ann, Polly Ann?"
2281,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,The rooster on my coalshed crows at break of day.

2287,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,And I will carry in the coal and the water from the spring

2309,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,They did not dare to shout it. It wouldn’t be right.

2322,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"And thus he let the wind sing, the stars sing and the grass sing,"
2323,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"The prankishness of love sing, the girl’s tingling feet sing,"
2324,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"Her trembling sweet hands sing, her mirror in the dark sing,"
2325,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"Her grace in the dark sing, her pillow in the dark sing,"
2326,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"The savage in her blood sing, her starved little heart sing,"
2327,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,Silently sing.
2328,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,
2329,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,"“Yes, I hear you, Mister Man,”"

2334,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,And every star was winking in the wide wicked dome.
2335,THE BLACKSMITH’S SERENADE,

3468,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,American sculpture: Clark Mills.... Never having seen General Jackson
3469,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"or an equestrian statue, he felt himself incompetent ... the incident,"
3470,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"however, made an impression on his mind, and he reflected sufficiently"
3471,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,to produce a design which was the very one subsequently executed....
3472,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,Congress appropriated the old cannon captured by General Jackson....
3473,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"Having no notion, nor even suspicion of a dignified sculptural"
3474,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"treatment of a theme, the clever carpenter felt, nevertheless, the need"
3475,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"of a feature.... He built a colossal horse, adroitly balanced on the"
3476,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"hind legs, and America gazed with bated breath. Nobody knows or cares"
3477,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,whether the rider looks like Jackson or not.
3478,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,
3479,THE MODEST JAZZ-BIRD,"“The extraordinary pose of the horse absorbs all attention, all"

3947,THE DREAM OF ALL THE SPRINGFIELD WRITERS,On tree-trunks black beneath the blossoms white:--
3948,THE DREAM OF ALL THE SPRINGFIELD WRITERS,"Just as the phosphorent merman, bound for home"
3949,THE DREAM OF ALL THE SPRINGFIELD WRITERS,Jewels his fire-path in the tides at night

4111,I,"O prodigal son, O recreant daughter,"
4112,I,When broken by the death of a child
4113,I,"You called for the greybeard Campbellite elder,"
4114,I,Who spoke as of old in the wild.
4115,I,His voice held echoes of the deep woods of Kentucky.
4116,I,"He towered in apostolic state,"
4117,I,While the portrait of Campbell emerged from the dark:
4118,I,That genius beautiful and great.
4119,I,"And millennial trumpets poised, half lifted,"
4120,I,Millennial trumpets that wait.
4121,I,
4122,I,
4123,II,II
4124,II,
4125,II,Like the woods of old Kentucky
4126,II,The memories of childhood

4129,II,"For witnesses to God, forever singing."
4130,II,"Like Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, the memories of childhood"
4131,II,Go in and in forever underground
4132,II,To river and fountain of whispering and mystery
4133,II,And many a haunted hall without a sound.
4134,II,To Indian hoards and carvings and graveyards unexplored.
4135,II,To pits so deep a torch turns to a star
4136,II,"Whirling ’round and going down to the deepest rocks of earth,"
4137,II,To the fiery roots of forests brave and far.
4138,II,

4140,III,III
4141,III,
4142,III,As I built cob-houses with small cousins on the floor:
4143,III,(The talk was not meant for me).
4144,III,Daguerreotypes shone. The back log sizzled
4145,III,And my grandmother traced the family tree.
4146,III,Then she swept to the proverbs of Campbell again.
4147,III,And we glanced at the portrait of that most benign of men
4148,III,Looking down through the evening gleam
4149,III,"With a bit of Andrew Jackson’s air,"
4150,III,More of Henry Clay
4151,III,And the statesmen of Thomas Jefferson’s day:
4152,III,"With the face of age,"
4153,III,"And the flush of youth,"
4154,III,"And that air of going on, forever free."
4155,III,
4156,III,For once upon a time ...
4157,III,"Long, long ago ..."
4158,III,In the holy forest land
4159,III,"There was a jolly pre-millennial band,"
4160,III,"When that text-armed apostle, Alexander Campbell"
4161,III,Held deathless debate with the wicked “infi-del.”
4162,III,The clearing was a picnic ground.
4163,III,Squirrels were barking.
4164,III,The seventeen year locust charged by.
4165,III,Wild turkeys perched on high.
4166,III,And millions of wild pigeons
4167,III,"Broke the limbs of trees,"
4168,III,"Then shut out the sun, as they swept on their way."
4169,III,"But ah, the wilder dove of God flew down"
4170,III,"To bring a secret glory, and to stay,"
4171,III,"With the proud hunter-trappers, patriarchs that came"
4172,III,To break bread together and to pray
4173,III,And oh the music of each living throbbing thing
4174,III,"When Campbell arose,"
4175,III,"A pillar of fire,"
4176,III,The great high priest of the Spring.
4177,III,
4178,III,He stepped from out the Brush Run Meeting House
4179,III,"To make the big woods his cathedrals,"
4180,III,"The river his baptismal font,"
4181,III,"The rolling clouds his bells,"
4182,III,"The storming skies his waterfalls,"
4183,III,His pastures and his wells.
4184,III,Despite all sternness in his word
4185,III,Richer grew the rushing blood
4186,III,Within our fathers’ coldest thought.
4187,III,Imagination at the flood
4188,III,Made flowery all they heard.
4189,III,The deep communion cup
4190,III,Of the whole South lifted up.
4191,III,
4192,III,"Who were the witnesses, the great cloud of witnesses"
4193,III,With which he was compassed around?
4194,III,The heroes of faith from the days of Abraham
4195,III,Stood on that blue-grass ground--
4196,III,While the battle-ax of thought
4197,III,Hewed to the bone
4198,III,That the utmost generation
4199,III,Till the world was set right
4200,III,Might have an America their own.
4201,III,For religion Dionysian
4202,III,Was far from Campbell’s doctrine.
4203,III,He preached with faultless logic
4204,III,An American Millennium:
4205,III,The social order
4206,III,Of a realist and farmer
4207,III,With every neighbor
4208,III,Within stone wall and border.
4209,III,And the tongues of flame came down
4210,III,Almost in spite of him.
4211,III,And now all but that Pentecost is dim.

4215,IV,
4216,IV,I walk the forest by the Daniel Boone trail.
4217,IV,By guide posts quaint.
4218,IV,And the blazes are faint
4219,IV,In the rough old bark
4220,IV,Of silver poplars
4221,IV,"And elms once slim,"
4222,IV,Now monoliths tall.
4223,IV,"I walk the aisle,"
4224,IV,The cathedral hall
4225,IV,That is haunted still
4226,IV,"With chariots dim,"
4227,IV,Whispering still
4228,IV,With debate and call.
4229,IV,
4230,IV,I come to you from Campbell.
4231,IV,"Turn again, prodigal"
4232,IV,Haunted by his name!
4233,IV,"Artist, singer, builder,"
4234,IV,The forest’s son or daughter!
4235,IV,"You, the blasphemer"
4236,IV,"Will yet know repentance,"
4237,IV,And Campbell old and grey
4238,IV,Will lead you to the dream-side
4239,IV,Of a pennyroyal river.
4240,IV,While your proud heart is shaken
4241,IV,Your confession will be taken
4242,IV,And your sins baptized away.
4243,IV,
4244,IV,"You, statesman-philosopher,"
4245,IV,Sage with high conceit
4246,IV,"Who speak of revolutions, in long words,"
4247,IV,And guide the little world as best you may:
4248,IV,I come to you from Campbell
4249,IV,And say he rides your way
4250,IV,And will wait with you the coming of his day.
4251,IV,"His horse still threads the forest,"
4252,IV,Though the storm be roaring down....
4253,IV,Campbell enters now your log-house door.
4254,IV,"Indeed you make him welcome, after many years,"
4255,IV,While the children build cob-houses on the floor.
4256,IV,
4257,IV,Let a thousand prophets have their due.
4258,IV,Let each have his boat in the sky.
4259,IV,But you were born for his secular millennium
4260,IV,"With the old Kentucky forest blooming like Heaven,"
4261,IV,And the red birds flying high.
