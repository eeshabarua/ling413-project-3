156,WOOD MAGIC,
157,WOOD MAGIC,"The woods lay dreaming in a topaz dream,"
158,WOOD MAGIC,"And we, who silently roamed hand in hand,"
159,WOOD MAGIC,"Were pilgrims in a strange, enchanted land,"
160,WOOD MAGIC,"Where life was love, and love was all a-gleam."
161,WOOD MAGIC,
162,WOOD MAGIC,And old remembered songs came back to greet
163,WOOD MAGIC,"Our ears, from other worlds of long ago,"
164,WOOD MAGIC,The worlds that we of earth may seldom know--
165,WOOD MAGIC,And to those songs we timed our vagrant feet.
166,WOOD MAGIC,
167,WOOD MAGIC,"We did not speak, we did not need to say"
168,WOOD MAGIC,The thought that lay so buried in our hearts--
169,WOOD MAGIC,"The thoughts as sweet as springtime rain, that"
170,WOOD MAGIC,starts
171,WOOD MAGIC,The buds to blossoming in wistful May.
172,WOOD MAGIC,
173,WOOD MAGIC,"We did not need to speak, we could not speak,"
174,WOOD MAGIC,The wonder words that we in silence knew--
175,WOOD MAGIC,"We walked, as very little children do,"
176,WOOD MAGIC,"Who feel, but cannot tell, the thing they seek."
177,WOOD MAGIC,
178,WOOD MAGIC,"Beyond a screen of bushes, bending low,"
179,WOOD MAGIC,"We knew that fair Titania lay at rest,"
180,WOOD MAGIC,"Her pillowed head upon her lover's breast,"
181,WOOD MAGIC,Her kisses swift as birds that come and go!
182,WOOD MAGIC,
183,WOOD MAGIC,"And underneath a wall of mottled stone,"
184,WOOD MAGIC,"We knew the sleeping beauty lay in state,"
185,WOOD MAGIC,"Entangled in a mist of tears, to wait"
186,WOOD MAGIC,The prince whose kiss would raise her to a throne.
187,WOOD MAGIC,
188,WOOD MAGIC,"Perhaps a witch with single flaming eye,"
189,WOOD MAGIC,Was watching from beneath the hemlock tree;
190,WOOD MAGIC,"And fairies that our gaze might never see,"
191,WOOD MAGIC,"Laughed at us as we, hand in hand, crept by."
192,WOOD MAGIC,
193,WOOD MAGIC,"Laughed at us? No, I somehow think they knew"
194,WOOD MAGIC,That you and I were kin to them that day!
195,WOOD MAGIC,I think they knew that we were years away
196,WOOD MAGIC,"From everything but make-believe, come true."
197,WOOD MAGIC,
198,WOOD MAGIC,"I think they knew that, singing through the air,"
199,WOOD MAGIC,"There thrilled a vague, insistent, harp-like call--"
200,WOOD MAGIC,"And that, where woodbine blazed against the wall,"
201,WOOD MAGIC,You held me close and kissed my wind-tossed hair!

207,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,
208,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"I took th' horses to th' brook--to water 'em you know,"
209,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,Th' air was cold with just a touch o' frost;
210,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,And as we went a-joggin' down I couldn't help but
211,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"think,"
212,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,O' city folk an' all the things they lost.
213,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,
214,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,O' cause they have their lighted streets--their Great
215,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"White Way an' such,"
216,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,O' course they have their buildings large an' tall;
217,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"But, my! they never know th' joy o' ridin' ter th'"
218,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"brook,"
219,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,An' somehow I don't envy 'em at all!
220,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,
221,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,Perhaps I'd like it--for awhile--to hear th' songs an'
222,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"laughter,"
223,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"But somehow, I don't know exactly why;"
224,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,I'd feel th' country callin' me; I'd long again fer
225,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"silence,"
226,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"An' fer God's mountains, blue against the sky."
227,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,
228,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"I took th' horses to th' brook--to water 'em you know,"
229,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,Th' day was pretty as a day can be;
230,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,An' as we went a-joggin' down I couldn't help but
231,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,"think,"
232,WATERIN' TH' HORSES,O' city folk an' all they never see!

239,I. THE CAVEMAN,I. THE CAVEMAN
240,I. THE CAVEMAN,
241,I. THE CAVEMAN,I live! And the scarlet sunrise is climbing the
242,I. THE CAVEMAN,"mountain steep,"
243,I. THE CAVEMAN,"I live... And below, in the caverns, the rest"
244,I. THE CAVEMAN,of my clansmen sleep;
245,I. THE CAVEMAN,"But I--I am here, and chanting, I could slay a"
246,I. THE CAVEMAN,"beast with my hand,"
247,I. THE CAVEMAN,And I thrill as the mist of the morning creeps up
248,I. THE CAVEMAN,from the rock-strewn land!
249,I. THE CAVEMAN,
250,I. THE CAVEMAN,"I live, I have strength for fighting--and courage to"
251,I. THE CAVEMAN,"rend and slay,"
252,I. THE CAVEMAN,I live! And my eyes are lifting to gaze at the new-
253,I. THE CAVEMAN,born day;
254,I. THE CAVEMAN,"And I pause, on the way to my hewn-out cave,"
255,I. THE CAVEMAN,"though I know that she waits me there,"
256,I. THE CAVEMAN,"My mate, with her eyes on the scarlet dawn, and the"
257,I. THE CAVEMAN,wind in her flame-like hair.
258,I. THE CAVEMAN,
259,I. THE CAVEMAN,I live--and the joy of living leaps up in my searching
260,I. THE CAVEMAN,"eyes,"
261,I. THE CAVEMAN,"I live, and my soul starts forward, to challenge the"
262,I. THE CAVEMAN,waking skies!
263,I. THE CAVEMAN,"Far down are the torrents roaring, far up are the"
264,I. THE CAVEMAN,"clouds, unfurled;"
265,I. THE CAVEMAN,"And I stand on the cliff, exultant, akin to the waking"
266,I. THE CAVEMAN,world.
267,I. THE CAVEMAN,
268,I. THE CAVEMAN,"The mists are gone, and an eagle sweeps down from"
269,I. THE CAVEMAN,"the mountain high,"
270,I. THE CAVEMAN,"And I wish that my arms were feathered and strong,"
271,I. THE CAVEMAN,"that I, too, might fly;"
272,I. THE CAVEMAN,"I live! I am one with the morning! Ah, I am a"
273,I. THE CAVEMAN,"MAN, and free!"
274,I. THE CAVEMAN,"And I shout aloud, and the scarlet dawn shouts back,"

281,II. THE PIONEER,
282,II. THE PIONEER,"I creep along, but silently,"
283,II. THE PIONEER,"For, oh, the dawn is coming;"
284,II. THE PIONEER,"I creep along, for I have heard"
285,II. THE PIONEER,"A flint-tipped arrow, humming;"
286,II. THE PIONEER,"And I have heard a snapping twig,"
287,II. THE PIONEER,Above the wind's low laughter;
288,II. THE PIONEER,"And I have known--and thrilled to know,"
289,II. THE PIONEER,That swift THEY followed after!
290,II. THE PIONEER,
291,II. THE PIONEER,"The forest turns from black to grey,"
292,II. THE PIONEER,The leaves are silver-shining;
293,II. THE PIONEER,But I have heard a far-off call--
294,II. THE PIONEER,The war-whoop's sullen whining.
295,II. THE PIONEER,"And I have been a naked form,"
296,II. THE PIONEER,Among the tree trunks prowling;
297,II. THE PIONEER,"And I have glimpsed a savage face,"
298,II. THE PIONEER,"That faded from me, scowling."
299,II. THE PIONEER,
300,II. THE PIONEER,"A rosy color sweeps the sky,"
301,II. THE PIONEER,"A vagrant lark is singing,"
302,II. THE PIONEER,"But, as I steal along the trail,"
303,II. THE PIONEER,I know that day is bringing
304,II. THE PIONEER,"A host of red-skins in its train,"
305,II. THE PIONEER,Their tommy-hawks are gleaming--
306,II. THE PIONEER,I SEE THEM NOW; or can it be
307,II. THE PIONEER,The first pale sunlight beaming?
308,II. THE PIONEER,
309,II. THE PIONEER,"I creep along, but stealthily,"
310,II. THE PIONEER,"For, oh, the dawn is coming!"
311,II. THE PIONEER,I creep along--but I have heard
312,II. THE PIONEER,"A flint-tipped arrow, humming...."
313,II. THE PIONEER,"And yet, my heart is light, inside,"
314,II. THE PIONEER,"My soul, itself, is flying"
315,II. THE PIONEER,To greet the dawn! I AM ALIVE--
316,AND WHAT IS DEATH--BUT DYING?,AND WHAT IS DEATH--BUT DYING?
317,AND WHAT IS DEATH--BUT DYING?,
318,AND WHAT IS DEATH--BUT DYING?,
319,AND WHAT IS DEATH--BUT DYING?,
320,AND WHAT IS DEATH--BUT DYING?,

322,III. THE FARMER,
323,III. THE FARMER,The dawn is here! I climb the hill;
324,III. THE FARMER,The earth is young and strangely still;
325,III. THE FARMER,A tender green is showing where
326,III. THE FARMER,But yesterday my fields were bare....
327,III. THE FARMER,"I climb and, as I climb, I sing;"
328,III. THE FARMER,"The dawn is here, and with it--spring!"
329,III. THE FARMER,
330,III. THE FARMER,"My oxen stamp the ground, and they"
331,III. THE FARMER,"Seem glad, with me, that soon the day"
332,III. THE FARMER,Will bring new work for us to do!
333,III. THE FARMER,The light above is clear and blue;
334,III. THE FARMER,"And one great cloud that swirls on high,"
335,III. THE FARMER,Seems sent from earth to kiss the sky.
336,III. THE FARMER,
337,III. THE FARMER,"The birds are coming back again,"
338,III. THE FARMER,They know that soon the golden grain
339,III. THE FARMER,Will wave above this fragrant loam;
340,III. THE FARMER,"The birds, with singing, hasten home;"
341,III. THE FARMER,"And I, who watch them, feel their song"
342,III. THE FARMER,"Deep in my soul, and nothing wrong,"
343,III. THE FARMER,"Or mean or small, can touch my heart...."
344,III. THE FARMER,"Down in the vale the smoke-wreaths start,"
345,III. THE FARMER,To softly curl above the trees;
346,III. THE FARMER,The fingers of a vagrant breeze
347,III. THE FARMER,"Steal tenderly across my hair,"
348,III. THE FARMER,"And toil is fled, and want, and care!"
349,III. THE FARMER,
350,III. THE FARMER,The dawn is here!
351,III. THE FARMER,I climb the hill;
352,III. THE FARMER,My very oxen seem to thrill--
353,III. THE FARMER,To feel the mystery of day.
354,III. THE FARMER,"The sun creeps out, and far away"
355,III. THE FARMER,"From man-made law I worship God,"
356,III. THE FARMER,"Who made the light, the cloud, the sod;"
357,III. THE FARMER,"I worship smilingly, and sing!"

366,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
367,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"It stands neglected, silent, far from the ways of men,"
368,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,A lonely little cottage beside a lonely glen;
369,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"And, dreaming there, I saw it when sunset's golden"
370,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,rays
371,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"Had touched it with the glory of other, sweeter days."
372,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
373,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"They say the house is haunted, and--well, it is, I"
374,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"guess,"
375,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,For every empty window just aches with loneliness;
376,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,With loneliness that tortures and memory that flays;
377,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"Ah, yes, the house is haunted with ghosts of other"
378,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,days.
379,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
380,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,The ghost of childish laughter rings on the narrow
381,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"stair,"
382,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"And, from a silent corner, the murmur of a prayer"
383,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"Steals out, and then a love song, and then a bugle"
384,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"call,"
385,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,And steps that do not falter along the quiet hall.
386,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
387,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,The story of the old house that stands beside the
388,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,glen?
389,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,That story is forgotten by every one; but when
390,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,The house is touched and softened by sunset's golden
391,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"rays,"
392,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,"I know that ghosts must haunt it, the ghosts of"
393,THE HAUNTED HOUSE,sweeter days.

2109,SINGING ON THE MARCH,"A little song of love and hope and home,"
2110,SINGING ON THE MARCH,A little song to cheer me on my way.
2111,SINGING ON THE MARCH,
2112,SINGING ON THE MARCH,"And though I bowed beneath the load I bore,"
2113,SINGING ON THE MARCH,"I found that, when I sang, the way was bright,"

2127,EASTER,
2128,EASTER,He came to call last night--
2129,EASTER,"And we began to talk, as young folk will,"
2130,EASTER,"Half carelessly, and half in awe, of God."
2131,EASTER,"It was the springtime, and the night was still"
2132,EASTER,"And fragrant, all about us."
2133,EASTER,And the sod
2134,EASTER,"Was fresh with tender grass,"
2135,EASTER,And overhead a crescent moon shone bright.
2136,EASTER,"And, ""God,"" he said, ""Has built the world on laws,"
2137,EASTER,"""Like some great watch, and every breathing space"
2138,EASTER,"""Is measured; and the system has no flaws,"
2139,EASTER,"""And nothing moves from its appointed place."
2140,EASTER,"""God is the Master Scientist,"" he said,"
2141,EASTER,His voice was bold and had a ring of truth--
2142,EASTER,"But God seemed ponderous, and far away...."
2143,EASTER,
2144,EASTER,"And then a gentle breeze danced overhead,"
2145,EASTER,"And caused the timid, new-born leaves to sway,"
2146,EASTER,"And we began to talk of love, and youth."
2147,EASTER,
2148,EASTER,"And then, I sent him home, and went upstairs,"
2149,EASTER,"To my still room, and flung the windows wide;"
2150,EASTER,And as I knelt to say my evening prayers
2151,EASTER,"I saw the stars, far smiling, in the sky."
2152,EASTER,"And, all at once, I knew the reason why"
2153,EASTER,I worshipped God... knew why He had sent
2154,EASTER,His son to save the world from sin and shame;
2155,EASTER,"And, suddenly, like some sweet, healing tide,"
2156,EASTER,The meaning of my life swept over me;
2157,EASTER,"And, through the dark, my groping soul could see"
2158,EASTER,"The Christ Who loved us, and was crucified."
2159,EASTER,
2160,EASTER,"And, as I knelt and watched the star's faint shine,"
2161,EASTER,"I felt God's hand, a moment, touching mine!"

2167,RESURRECTION,
2168,RESURRECTION,"You took the lilt from my heart of hearts,"
2169,RESURRECTION,And the breath of song from my soul;
2170,RESURRECTION,And the mind of me that had once been free
2171,RESURRECTION,"And buoyantly young, and whole;"
2172,RESURRECTION,"Grew calm and still as a barren sea,"
2173,RESURRECTION,"Where never a star beam shone,"
2174,RESURRECTION,A sea where never a ripple danced--
2175,RESURRECTION,That reflected your face along.
2176,RESURRECTION,
2177,RESURRECTION,I walked in a daze down well-worn paths--
2178,RESURRECTION,Paths that your feet had trod;
2179,RESURRECTION,"I thought your thoughts and I spoke your tongue,"
2180,RESURRECTION,I knelt to your hostile God.
2181,RESURRECTION,"And the dreams that had been a part of me,"
2182,RESURRECTION,"I tossed with a sigh away,"
2183,RESURRECTION,And left to rust in the misty dust
2184,RESURRECTION,Of the land called Yesterday.
2185,RESURRECTION,
2186,RESURRECTION,"My hands lay folded in slim repose,"
2187,RESURRECTION,Quite as you bade them rest;
2188,RESURRECTION,"Folded, meek, o'er the leaden heart"
2189,RESURRECTION,That tortured my gypsie breast.
2190,RESURRECTION,And I smiled with my lips--my eyes were numb--
2191,RESURRECTION,"I smiled for I never knew,"
2192,RESURRECTION,"That the mind of me was a lifeless sea,"
2193,RESURRECTION,Reflecting the face of you!
2194,RESURRECTION,
2195,RESURRECTION,"You took the lilt from my carefree life,"
2196,RESURRECTION,And the song from my singing heart;
2197,RESURRECTION,"But there came a day when the world grew gray,"
2198,RESURRECTION,When I knew that we must part....
2199,RESURRECTION,So I tore you out of your soul-bound shrine--
2200,RESURRECTION,"And, oh, though it caused me pain,"
2201,RESURRECTION,I raised my face to the sky and knew
2202,RESURRECTION,That my song would come again!

2209,THE QUEEN,"""Barefooted came the beggar maid,"""
2210,THE QUEEN,So ran the minstrel's lay--
2211,THE QUEEN,"""Barefooted came the beggar maid"
2212,THE QUEEN,"""Before the King Corpethua."""
2213,THE QUEEN,"But, oh, her face was like a light,"
2214,THE QUEEN,"Her hair was black as middle night,"
2215,THE QUEEN,And whispers ran from left to right--
2216,THE QUEEN,"""She is more beautiful than day!"""
2217,THE QUEEN,
2218,THE QUEEN,"""In robe and crown the king stepped down,"""
2219,THE QUEEN,So ran the minstrel's lay--
2220,THE QUEEN,"""In robe and crown the king stepped down,"
2221,THE QUEEN,"""To meet and greet her by the way."""
2222,THE QUEEN,"And so the beggar maid became,"
2223,THE QUEEN,"A Queen, but just a queen in name,"
2224,THE QUEEN,"For, with her gypsie eyes aflame,"
2225,THE QUEEN,Her mirror heard her say--
2226,THE QUEEN,
2227,THE QUEEN,"I was a beggar maid, I used to lie"
2228,THE QUEEN,"Silent and unafraid, beneath the sky,"
2229,THE QUEEN,"And watch the stars--my little sisters, they,"
2230,THE QUEEN,I used to wake at dawning time of day
2231,THE QUEEN,To plunge my body in some mountain stream--
2232,THE QUEEN,I was a beggar maid!
2233,THE QUEEN,"Is this a dream,"
2234,THE QUEEN,This golden crown I wear upon my head?
2235,THE QUEEN,"This robe of royal purple and of red,"
2236,THE QUEEN,"This rope of pearls, this ring, these silken shoon?"
2237,THE QUEEN,
2238,THE QUEEN,Not long ago the silver crescent moon
2239,THE QUEEN,"Was like a hand that beckoned me to stray,"
2240,THE QUEEN,And cities seemed vast centuries away;
2241,THE QUEEN,"And as my feet--swift feet, they were, and light--"
2242,THE QUEEN,"Carried me through the wonder of the night,"
2243,THE QUEEN,"I never thought of kings, or kingly power--"
2244,THE QUEEN,"My life was all one splendid, singing hour!"
2245,THE QUEEN,
2246,THE QUEEN,"I love my king--He raised me from the dust,"
2247,THE QUEEN,"And looked at me with wonder, and with trust;"
2248,THE QUEEN,"My hair hung, tangled, to the waist of me,"
2249,THE QUEEN,"He brushed it from my eyes, that he might see"
2250,THE QUEEN,Deep into them!
2251,THE QUEEN,"He set me on his steed,"
2252,THE QUEEN,"He never knew my name, or asked my creed,"
2253,THE QUEEN,He just believed in me--and told me so.
2254,THE QUEEN,"I love my king, I love him well, but, oh--"
2255,THE QUEEN,"Once I wore poppies, red upon my brow,"
2256,THE QUEEN,"(A crown seems very heavy to me, now,)"
2257,THE QUEEN,"And once I wore, for all the world to see"
2258,THE QUEEN,"A gown of rags.  (Now, velvets stifle me!)"
2259,THE QUEEN,And once my hands (how soft they are!) were strong
2260,THE QUEEN,To toil for me.
2261,THE QUEEN,The days seem very long
2262,THE QUEEN,While I must sit in state above the land--
2263,THE QUEEN,I love my king... But does he understand?
2264,THE QUEEN,"I was a beggar maid, I used to lie"
2265,THE QUEEN,Silent and unafraid beneath the sky--
2266,THE QUEEN,"And, now that I am queen, my being longs"
2267,THE QUEEN,"To hear, once more, the little slumber songs"
2268,THE QUEEN,Of night birds nesting in some forest tree--
2269,THE QUEEN,"I want to be myself, again, and free!"
2270,THE QUEEN,"I want to climb the crest of some great hill,"
2271,THE QUEEN,"And watch the sunset clouds, again, and thrill"
2272,THE QUEEN,Before the color of them!  I would stand
2273,THE QUEEN,"Alone, once more, and see the wistful land"
2274,THE QUEEN,Take on the tint of twilight.
2275,THE QUEEN,I would pray
2276,THE QUEEN,"My gypsie prayer, again, at close of day!"
2277,THE QUEEN,
2278,THE QUEEN,I love my king--for he has given me
2279,THE QUEEN,"Rare pearls, the treasure of a sighing sea,"
2280,THE QUEEN,"And rubies, red as sunset clouds a-glow"
2281,THE QUEEN,And opals like the wistful winds that blow
2282,THE QUEEN,At twilight-time.
2283,THE QUEEN,
2284,THE QUEEN,"But I would wear, instead,"
2285,THE QUEEN,"Wild forest flowers, twined about my head--"
2286,THE QUEEN,"And I would dance, barefooted, on the sod,"
2287,THE QUEEN,An innovation to my pagan God!
2288,THE QUEEN,
2289,THE QUEEN,Am I a queen?  What is this crown I wear?
2290,THE QUEEN,I tear it from my smoothly plaited hair--
2291,THE QUEEN,"I lay my ring, my rope of pearls, aside;"
2292,THE QUEEN,Am I a queen--am I a monarch's bride?
2293,THE QUEEN,The soul of me is still a gypsie thing--
2294,THE QUEEN,"I pull them off, the glowing gems, the ring...."
2295,THE QUEEN,
2296,THE QUEEN,"I love my king, I love him well--but, oh,"
2297,"GIVE ME MY RAGS, AGAIN, AND LET ME GO!","GIVE ME MY RAGS, AGAIN, AND LET ME GO!"
2298,"GIVE ME MY RAGS, AGAIN, AND LET ME GO!",

2926,AT PARTING,"For, dearest, I must leave you while we care!"
2927,AT PARTING,"Leave you while tears of vain regret are starting,"
2928,AT PARTING,While I can look at you and find you fair.
2929,AT PARTING,"Could we endure a morn of bitter waking,"
2930,AT PARTING,Could we accept a love that would seem less?
2931,AT PARTING,"Dear, I must go the while my heart is breaking--"
2932,AT PARTING,Go while my world is filled with happiness.
2933,AT PARTING,
2934,AT PARTING,"Love of my soul, our dream has been so flaming,"
2935,AT PARTING,"That, if we waited, it might smoulder down--"

2937,AT PARTING,All that was vivid--ashes dimly brown.

2972,THE REFUGE,"Our steps rang out as we crossed the sill,"
2973,THE REFUGE,"And the place was dimly bright,"

2976,THE REFUGE,
2977,THE REFUGE,We waited there while the wind moaned past
2978,THE REFUGE,And the thunder crashed in the air;
2979,THE REFUGE,"And the door of Love's abode blew fast,"
2980,THE REFUGE,But we didn't know--or care!
2981,THE REFUGE,"For we heard a song in the driving rain,"
2982,THE REFUGE,And the sky seemed warmly gray;
2983,THE REFUGE,"And the tempest rang with a mad refrain,"
2984,THE REFUGE,And the world seemed years away.

2989,THE REFUGE,And the scorching sun of the noonday gleams
2990,THE REFUGE,From the pitiless sky above.
2991,THE REFUGE,"But once, ah, once--in that dusky place,"
2992,THE REFUGE,"When the lightning flashed through the air,"
2993,THE REFUGE,"I saw its flame on your upturned face,"
2994,THE REFUGE,And its glow on your vivid hair.
2995,THE REFUGE,
2996,THE REFUGE,We have strayed away--we have strayed away--
2997,THE REFUGE,For the world is all too wide....

3338,JIM-DOG,A-lovin' him.
3339,JIM-DOG,He always seemed ter understand.
3340,JIM-DOG,He'd rub his nose against my hand
