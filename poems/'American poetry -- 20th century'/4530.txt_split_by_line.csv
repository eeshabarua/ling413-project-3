210,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,In the rain
211,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,Rows of street lamps are saints in bright garments
212,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,That flow long with the bend of knees.
213,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,They lift pale heads nimbussed with golden spikes.
214,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,
215,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,Up the lanes of liquid onyx
216,MIDNIGHT WORSHIP:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE,Toward the high fire-laden altars

225,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,Boats merge with the bronze-gold welters about their keels.
226,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,The trees float upward in gray and green flames.
227,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,"Clouds, swans, boats, trees, all gliding up a hillside"
228,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,After some gray old women who lift their gaunt forms
229,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,From falling shrouds of leaves.
230,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,
231,ASCENSION:  AUTUMN DUSK IN CENTRAL PARK,Thin fingered twigs clutch darkly at nothing.

238,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,
239,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,The thin hill pushes against the mist.
240,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,Its fading defiance sounds in the umber and red of autumn leaves.
241,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,Like a dead arm around a warm throat
242,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,Is the sagging embrace of the river
243,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,Laid grayly about the shore.
244,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,
245,STARTLED FORESTS: HUDSON RIVER,The train passes.

254,WINTER STREETS,"The stars, escaping,"

256,WINTER STREETS,"The houses, rearing themselves higher,"
257,WINTER STREETS,Assemble among the clouds.
258,WINTER STREETS,Night blows through me.
259,WINTER STREETS,I am clear with its bitterness.

261,WINTER STREETS,Like a crystal leaf.

264,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,
265,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,The trees hold out pale gilded branches
266,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,Stiff and high in the wind.
267,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,On the lawns
268,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,Patches of gray-lilac snow
269,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,Melt in the hollows of the terraces.
270,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,"The park is an ocean of fawn-colored plush,"
271,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,Ridged and faded.
272,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,"Sharp and delicate,"
273,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,My shadow moves after me on the rumpled grass--
274,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,Grass like a pillow worn by a dear head.
275,FEBRUARY SPRINGTIME,Joy!

277,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE
278,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,
279,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,The lights trickle grayly down from the hoary palisades
280,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,And drip into the river.
281,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,Leaden reflections flow into the water.
282,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,"Framed in your window,"
283,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,Your little face glows deceptively
284,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,"In a rigid ecstasy,"
285,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,As the wide-winged morning
286,THE ASSUMPTION OF COLUMBINE,Folds back the mist.

289,FROM BROOKLYN,
290,FROM BROOKLYN,Along the shore
291,FROM BROOKLYN,A black net of branches
292,FROM BROOKLYN,Tangles the pulpy yellow lamps.
293,FROM BROOKLYN,The shell-colored sky is lustrous with the fading sun.
294,FROM BROOKLYN,Across the river Manhattan floats--
295,FROM BROOKLYN,Dim gardens of fire--
296,FROM BROOKLYN,"And rushing invisible toward me through the fog,"
297,FROM BROOKLYN,A hurricane of faces.
298,FROM BROOKLYN,
299,SNOW DANCE,SNOW DANCE
300,SNOW DANCE,
301,SNOW DANCE,Black brooms of trees sweep the sky clean;
302,SNOW DANCE,"Sweep the house fronts,"
303,SNOW DANCE,And leave them bleak in sleep.
304,SNOW DANCE,High up the empty moon
305,SNOW DANCE,Spills her vacuity.
306,SNOW DANCE,
307,SNOW DANCE,I dance.
308,SNOW DANCE,My long black shadow
309,SNOW DANCE,
310,SNOW DANCE,Weaves an invisible pattern of pain.
311,SNOW DANCE,The snow
312,SNOW DANCE,Is embroidered with my happiness.

317,POTTER'S FIELD,Crushed beneath fear-hastened feet...
318,POTTER'S FIELD,
319,POTTER'S FIELD,Silver paper lanterns glow and shudder
320,POTTER'S FIELD,in flat patterns
321,POTTER'S FIELD,On a gray eternal face
322,POTTER'S FIELD,Stained with pain.
323,POTTER'S FIELD,

328,LIGHTS AT NIGHT,"Surge against the clouds,"
329,LIGHTS AT NIGHT,Pushing up the darkness.
330,LIGHTS AT NIGHT,
331,LIGHTS AT NIGHT,"In the country,"
332,LIGHTS AT NIGHT,"Is the faint pressure of oil lamps,"
333,LIGHTS AT NIGHT,"That sputter,"

351,SUMMER NIGHT,Has sickly leaves glistening against her
352,SUMMER NIGHT,Like flies on a fat white face.
353,SUMMER NIGHT,
354,SUMMER NIGHT,The thick-witted drunkard on the park bench
355,SUMMER NIGHT,Touches a girl's breast
356,SUMMER NIGHT,That throbs with its own ruthless and stupid delight.
357,SUMMER NIGHT,The new-born child crawls in his mother's filth.
358,SUMMER NIGHT,"Life, the sleep walker,"
359,SUMMER NIGHT,Lifts toward the skies
360,SUMMER NIGHT,An immense gesture of indecency.
361,SUMMER NIGHT,
362,NEW YORK,NEW YORK
363,NEW YORK,

373,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,"Millions of bronze eyes,"
374,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,"Unassailable,"
375,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,Obliterating all they see:
376,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,The warm contiguous crowd in the street below
377,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,"Chills,"
378,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,"Mists,"
379,SUNSET:  BATTERY PARK,"Drifts past those hungry eyes of Eternity,"

387,CROWDS,
388,CROWDS,"The cool air sags,"
389,CROWDS,Heavy with the thickness of bodies.
390,CROWDS,I am elated with bodies.
391,CROWDS,They have stolen me from myself.
392,CROWDS,"I love the way they beat me to life,"
393,CROWDS,Pay me for their cruelties.
394,CROWDS,In the close intimacy I feel for them
395,CROWDS,There is the indecency I like.
396,CROWDS,
397,CROWDS,"I belong to them,"
398,CROWDS,To these whom I hate;
399,CROWDS,"And because we can never know each other,"
400,CROWDS,"Or be anything to each other,"
401,CROWDS,"Though we have been the most,"
402,CROWDS,I sell so much of me that could bring a better price.

406,RIOTS,"As if all the birds rushed up in the air,"
407,RIOTS,Fluttering;
408,RIOTS,"Hoots, calls, cries."
409,RIOTS,I never knew such a monster even in child dreams.
410,RIOTS,
411,RIOTS,It grows:
412,RIOTS,Glass smashed;
413,RIOTS,Stores shut;
414,RIOTS,Windows tight closed;
415,RIOTS,"Dull, far-off murmurs of voices."
416,RIOTS,
417,RIOTS,Blood--
418,RIOTS,"The soft, sticky patter of falling drops in the silence."
419,RIOTS,Everything inundated.
420,RIOTS,Faces float off in a red dream.
421,RIOTS,Still the song of the sweet succulent patter.
422,RIOTS,
423,RIOTS,
424,RIOTS,Blood--
425,RIOTS,I think it oozes from my finger tips.
426,RIOTS,--Or maybe it drips from the brow of Jesus.

429,THE CITY AT NIGHT,
430,THE CITY AT NIGHT,Life wriggles in and out
431,THE CITY AT NIGHT,Through the narrow ways
432,THE CITY AT NIGHT,And circuitous passages:
433,THE CITY AT NIGHT,"Something monstrous and horrible,"
434,THE CITY AT NIGHT,"A passion without any master,"
435,THE CITY AT NIGHT,Male sexual fluid trickling through the darkness
436,THE CITY AT NIGHT,And setting fire to whatever it touches.
437,THE CITY AT NIGHT,
438,THE CITY AT NIGHT,That is the master
439,THE CITY AT NIGHT,Bestowing a casual caress on a slave.
440,THE CITY AT NIGHT,Quiver under it!

451,LULLABY,The milk of the moon.

456,EMBARKATION OF CYTHERA,My inflated curves
457,EMBARKATION OF CYTHERA,Melt in the peaceful stagnance of the bath.
458,EMBARKATION OF CYTHERA,If I were to die
459,EMBARKATION OF CYTHERA,I would resist the final agony
460,EMBARKATION OF CYTHERA,With only a faint quiver
461,EMBARKATION OF CYTHERA,From my escaping thighs.

466,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,I throw back my long hair and the fountain floats it out
467,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,Like a fiery fan.
468,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,My wide stretched arms are white coral branches.
469,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,The liquid shadows seek between my amber breasts.
470,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,
471,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,But the fire is cool.
472,CHRISTIAN LUXURIES,It cannot burn me.

476,NARROW FLOWERS,I am a gray lily.
477,NARROW FLOWERS,My roots are deep.
478,NARROW FLOWERS,I cannot lift my hands
479,NARROW FLOWERS,For one thin yellow butterfly.
480,NARROW FLOWERS,Yet last night I grew up to a star.
481,NARROW FLOWERS,My shade swirled mistily
482,NARROW FLOWERS,Seven mountains high.
483,NARROW FLOWERS,I lifted my face to another face.
484,NARROW FLOWERS,The moon made a burning shadow on my brow.
485,NARROW FLOWERS,"Washed by the light,"
486,NARROW FLOWERS,My sharp breasts silvered.
487,NARROW FLOWERS,My dance was an arc of mist
488,NARROW FLOWERS,From west to east.

490,EYES,EYES
491,EYES,
492,EYES,"There are arms of ice around me,"
493,EYES,And a hand of ice on my heart.
494,EYES,If they should come to bury me
495,EYES,I would not flinch or start.
496,EYES,For eyes are freezing me--
497,EYES,Eyes too cold for hate.
498,EYES,"I think the ground,"
499,EYES,"Because it is dark,"
500,EYES,A warmer place to wait.

505,AFTER YOUTH,"Exotic colors in the lamplit darkness of wet streets,"
506,AFTER YOUTH,"Musk and roses in the twilight,"
507,AFTER YOUTH,The moon in the park like a golden balloon...
508,AFTER YOUTH,
509,AFTER YOUTH,"Then to awaken and find the shadows fled,"
510,AFTER YOUTH,The music gone...
511,AFTER YOUTH,"Empty, bleak!"
