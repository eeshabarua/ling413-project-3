66,INTRODUCTION,
67,INTRODUCTION,These jingles were written by a child for children. The young author
68,INTRODUCTION,does not expect that any one will imagine they were intended to be
69,INTRODUCTION,a contribution to poetry or literature. They will be of interest to
70,INTRODUCTION,adults principally as an illustration of the way a child's mind views
71,INTRODUCTION,some of the every-day situations of life. Grown people will also be
72,INTRODUCTION,interested to see how easily a young child can put facts into the
73,INTRODUCTION,jingle form when freedom of expression is acquired early.
74,INTRODUCTION,
75,INTRODUCTION,Those who have read Mrs. Stoner's _Natural Education_ will recall
76,INTRODUCTION,that Winifred learned almost as a babe to use the typewriter. This
77,INTRODUCTION,"helped her in her spelling and composition, so that she gained ease"
78,INTRODUCTION,and freedom in expressing herself on any topic that she understood.
79,INTRODUCTION,She wrote out everything she learned so that she might the better get
80,INTRODUCTION,a grasp of it and remember it. And she found that when some kinds of
81,INTRODUCTION,facts were put together in a jingle they could be fixed with less
82,INTRODUCTION,effort and retained more securely than if they were learned in the
83,INTRODUCTION,ordinary way--by rote and without any method of organization.
84,INTRODUCTION,
85,INTRODUCTION,Rhyme and rhythm seem to furnish to the young mind an easy and
86,INTRODUCTION,effective method of relating and expressing facts ordinarily
87,INTRODUCTION,dissociated from anything of interest to a child. As long as such
88,INTRODUCTION,"facts are presented to the young in home and school, the jingle will"
89,INTRODUCTION,"prove of service to teachers and parents, and of interest and value to"
90,INTRODUCTION,"children. In addition, some of these jingles will delight the young"
91,INTRODUCTION,"merely because of their rhythmical quality, while others will afford"
92,INTRODUCTION,amusement because of the humorous interpretation they put on many of
93,INTRODUCTION,the events that are daily experienced by children everywhere.
94,INTRODUCTION,
95,INTRODUCTION,Any adult who may read these jingles should be informed that many of
96,INTRODUCTION,them were written when Winifred was hardly more than a babe. And all
97,INTRODUCTION,of them were dashed off without effort to achieve poetic merit. One
98,INTRODUCTION,characteristic that makes them of interest is their spontaneity. As
99,INTRODUCTION,an illustration of the readiness with which Winifred can construct a
100,INTRODUCTION,"jingle, I may say that when she was twelve years of age, I happened one"
101,INTRODUCTION,day to read her the following essay on _Bones_ written by a pupil:
102,INTRODUCTION,
103,INTRODUCTION,"""Bones is the framework of the body. If I had no bones in me, I should"
104,INTRODUCTION,"not have so much shape as I have now. If I had no bones my brain,"
105,INTRODUCTION,"heart, lungs, and larger blood vessels would be lying around in me, and"
106,INTRODUCTION,"might get hurt. If my bones were burned I should be brittle, because it"
107,INTRODUCTION,would take the animal out of me. If I was soaked in acid I should be
108,INTRODUCTION,limber. I'd rather be soaked than burned. Some of my bones don't grow
109,INTRODUCTION,close to my others snug like the branches to the trunk of a tree. The
110,INTRODUCTION,reason why they don't grow that way is because they have joints. Joints
111,INTRODUCTION,is good things to have in bones. All my bones put together make a
112,INTRODUCTION,skeleton. Some animals have their skeleton on the outside. I am glad I
113,INTRODUCTION,"am not them animals, for my skeleton like it is on the chart would not"
114,INTRODUCTION,"look very well on my outside."""
115,INTRODUCTION,
116,INTRODUCTION,I asked her if she would put the essay into a rhyme. She ran off to
117,INTRODUCTION,"her typewriter, and in twelve minutes came back with the jingle, _I'm"
118,INTRODUCTION,"glad I'm not an Exo_. It is published exactly as she handed it to me,"
119,INTRODUCTION,without change in content or in form.
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,Mrs. Stoner's _Natural Education_ describes in detail how Winifred has
122,INTRODUCTION,been educated up to this point in her career. This book of jingles
123,INTRODUCTION,presents some concrete evidence of the results of Mrs. Stoner's method
124,INTRODUCTION,"of teaching freedom of expression, and her many devices for assisting"
125,INTRODUCTION,"a child to retain more or less formal facts in history, the sciences,"
126,INTRODUCTION,"and so on. The book will prove of interest and help to children, and"
127,INTRODUCTION,parents and teachers should be able to get suggestions and practical
128,INTRODUCTION,teaching devices from it.

1627,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Wise Mother Earth she knew this clime would suit good Santa well,"
1628,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"For here no foolish, idle folks would ever come to dwell;"
1629,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Nor pay the good Saint visits which would waste his precious time,"
1630,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,While he could work much faster here than in a warmer clime.
1631,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1632,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"But never did he suffer from the icebergs at the Pole,"
1633,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,As fairies kept his fireplace all full of red-hot coal;
1634,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Or heaped bright burning logs on it as full as it could hold,"
1635,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,So Santa never felt a tweak of Jack Frost's biting cold.
1636,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1637,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Likewise the fairies brought to him and his most faithful spouse,"
1638,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Just everything that they could need to keep a cozy house.
1639,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,And even cooked their victuals and brought them every day
1640,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Exactly at the proper time, upon a huge hot tray."
1641,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1642,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And after they had eaten all the dainties on the tray,"
1643,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,The good kind fairies quickly came and took the tray away;
1644,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"So Mrs. Claus had no excuse for being cross or sad,"
1645,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Since no experience she had had with Bridgets getting mad.
1646,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1647,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"When Santa finished all his toys, he put them in a sack,"
1648,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Where he intended carrying them just like a pedler's pack,"
1649,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,But Mother Earth surprised the Saint and to his palace led
1650,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Eight lovely prancing reindeer and a large commodious sled.
1651,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1652,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"These reindeer were the cousins of swift Pegasus, the steed"
1653,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Who helped the hero Perseus when he was in great need;
1654,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And, like the flying hero horse, they lived up in the sky,"
1655,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Till Mother Earth had need of them to help old Santa fly.
1656,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1657,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And so on every Christmas eve for full ten hundred years,"
1658,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Good Santa and his reindeer fleet have banished children's tears
1659,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"By bringing them most all the gifts their little hearts could wish,"
1660,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And filling stockings, shoes and plates, and even puddin dish."
1661,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1662,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"But when last Christmas came around, good Mother Earth, she said,"
1663,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"""Dear Santa, I have something fine for you to use instead"
1664,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Of your good, faithful reindeer and your big old-fashioned sled,"
1665,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"For here's a lovely aeroplane, all painted shining red."""
1666,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1667,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,The wise old lady then declared that he could safely fly
1668,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"With this machine most anywhere away up in the sky,"
1669,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And travel far, far faster than the reindeer who were fleet"
1670,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,But stumbled sometimes on the roofs made slippery with sleet.
1671,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1672,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"The aeroplane could carry well a larger load of toys,"
1673,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"So he could visit more good girls and also little boys,"
1674,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Who live in far off heathen lands where everyone's a sinner,"
1675,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,But that's no reason each should do without a Christmas dinner.
1676,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,With this machine he'd save some time to look out for each pet
1677,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Of all the little girls and boys, as they so oft forget"
1678,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,To treat their pets most kindly upon the Christmas morn
1679,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,In memory of the Saviour who on this day was born.
1680,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1681,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And likewise all the horses, the cows and pigs and sheep,"
1682,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,For men so seldom think of them when Christmas time they keep;
1683,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And even wild, fierce animals, and fishes in the sea,"
1684,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Should all be made quite happy at Christmas time to be.
1685,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1686,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"""I do not like this plan at all of giving up my sled"
1687,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And my good faithful reindeer,"" so good old Santa said."
1688,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,But Mother Earth she laughed at him and said she would repay
1689,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"The reindeer, whom she would send home straight to the Milky Way."
1690,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1691,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,But Santa was old-fashioned and had great fears to fly
1692,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Without his sled and reindeer, he'd used in years gone by,"
1693,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,And begged that on his maiden trip these true old friends to take
1694,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,To help him should the aeroplane prove but a wicked fake.
1695,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"The laughing Earth then granted him this very small request,"
1696,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,And early on glad Christmas eve (the eve of all most blest)
1697,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"He started forth upon his trip, did good old Santa dear,"
1698,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,Guiding his Wright aeroplane with feelings of great fear.
1699,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1700,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,But Mother Earth showed she was wise and knew just what was best
1701,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,To help the good old tired saint while on his children quest;
1702,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And fast the good Wright aeroplane it flew both low and high,"
1703,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"So Santa took the Earth's advice, and though he heaved a sigh,"
1704,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,
1705,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"He dropped the poor old worn-out sled as he was passing by,"
1706,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And people said, who saw it fall, ""A meteor from the sky!"""
1707,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Then, kissing each good reindeer, he bade them all farewell,"
1708,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And left them in the Milky Way, forever there to dwell."
1709,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And you, my little playmates, who have heard the tiny hoofs"
1710,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Of the wondrous flying steeds pattering on the roofs,"
1711,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"If you would like to catch a glimpse of Santa's good reindeer,"
1712,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"Then wait until it's dark some night, and when the sky is clear,"
1713,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"You'll see them very plainly in the broad light Milky Way,"
1714,SANTA'S REINDEER IN THE SKY,"And there, for all the time to come, these steeds will romp and play."

2098,THE WONDERLAND OF MATEMATIKO,As making dress patterns for ladies so fair;

2257,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2258,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"The mother dog she wagged her tail, with pride she was puffed up,"
2259,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"As her great master stood right near and smiled upon her pup,"
2260,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"While saying, ""Higgens, listen well to what I have to say,"
2261,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And care for this good mother dog and her fine pup each day.
2262,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2263,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"""I'll name him for my ancestor, the great and famous Kent,"
2264,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And in that name to the dog show next year he shall be sent,"
2265,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Where I am sure he'll win the prize above all others there,"
2266,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"For he is perfect in his shape and has fine silky hair."""
2267,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2268,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"So little Kent was tended well and petted every day,"
2269,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"He never had to seek for bones and only had to play,"
2270,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And having nothing else to do on mischief he was bent,"
2271,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Was this aristocratic pup, owned by the great Lord Dent."
2272,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2273,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And when a year had passed around, one day the master came"
2274,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"To take him to the London show, where he would win great fame;"
2275,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"But Kent was very naughty, as he did not wish to go"
2276,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Away from his good kennel home to any prize dog show.
2277,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2278,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"At last his master whipped Pup Kent and, oh, but he did swear,"
2279,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Because Kent snapped at Higgens, who was combing his fine hair"
2280,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And putting on a collar with a chain of golden beads;
2281,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Such ornaments Kent could not see that any puppy needs.
2282,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2283,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"At last the royal pup was dressed in pupdom regal style,"
2284,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And drove in a fine carriage, oh, for many a weary mile,"
2285,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Until he came to London town, where nothing he could see,"
2286,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Because all things were hidden with a fog as thick as could be.
2287,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2288,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Before he'd even time to think, this 'ristocratic pup,"
2289,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"He found himself in a small cage with all the doors shut up,"
2290,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And many men were standing round and gazing long at him,"
2291,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"While passing comments on his shape of head, and tail, and limb."
2292,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2293,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Kent glared at them in silence and he would not wag his tail,"
2294,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"In fact, just like a good young boy who might be put in jail"
2295,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"When he had never done a thing to break the country's law,"
2296,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"So felt this little terrier, this pup without a flaw."
2297,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And when the judges thought that he should have the ribbon blue
2298,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Because of his most perfect blood shown by the records true,"
2299,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,He snapped and barked and even bit at those who came quite near
2300,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"To tie the lovely ribbon on the neck of ""PUPPY DEAR."""
2301,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2302,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,So they decided that despite his wondrous pedigree
2303,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"There yet was something in his blood that ought not there to be,"
2304,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And gave the prize, a silver cup, to a more common dog,"
2305,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Who lay so still and quiet that he might have been a log.
2306,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2307,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,But when that evening our Lord Dent beheld with great surprise
2308,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"That a less blooded terrier had won the noble prize,"
2309,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"He felt so very angry that he wished to beat Pup Kent,"
2310,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And ordered that the beastly dog should quickly home be sent.
2311,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2312,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"But while poor Kent was going home so sad and in disgrace,"
2313,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,He got away from Higgens and he found another place
2314,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Far, far away from kennels of the great and wealthy Dent,"
2315,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Near to a peaceful village, the runaway he went."
2316,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2317,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Here he lay down so tired and thought of many a bone,"
2318,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Which now was being gnawed each day by his good ma alone,"
2319,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Since Kent, her darling puppy boy, was, oh, so far away,"
2320,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Oh, how he wished to gnaw a bone with his good ma this day!"
2321,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2322,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"But as he lay a-dreaming of lovely things to eat,"
2323,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Quite suddenly a large gray rat ran right across his feet,"
2324,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And after it there followed an Irishman named Pat,"
2325,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Who sought to make a timely end of bad old Mister Rat.
2326,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2327,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Big Pat was armed with a huge club and called to his old dog,"
2328,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"""Now, come along, ye lazy baste, before he's in the bog!"""
2329,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Then Kent he jumped and in one bound he seized poor Mister Rat,"
2330,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Shook him about till he was dead and then brought him to Pat.
2331,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2332,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Big Pat he gazed in wonder at the clever little dog,"
2333,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And sitting down upon a large and green, moss covered log,"
2334,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Said, ""Shure, ye bate this lazy hound that kennot catch a rat,"
2335,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And if ye'll stay right here, me boy, I'll trate ye well,"" says Pat."
2336,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2337,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Then proudly Kent he wagged his tail and tried so hard to smile
2338,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Upon the good old Irishman, who patted him a while,"
2339,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"Then coaxed the stranger after him right through a broad green lane,"
2340,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Which led to the fine country home of good Sir Michael Kane.
2341,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2342,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And here Pat introduced the pup to all the family,"
2343,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And they were all so very kind as any folks could be.
2344,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"They patted his soft silky hair and praised him to the sky,"
2345,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And gave him a big gravy dish all filled with nice meat pie,"
2346,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And likewise a huge saucer, which was full of real sweet cream,"
2347,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Which made the hungry doggie think that he was in a dream.
2348,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2349,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"So here Dog Kent decided was the best place for to dwell,"
2350,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And here he still is living and is feeling' very well.
2351,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,He goes each morning to the barn and helps his good friend Pat
2352,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"To catch the naughty rodents, who are called the name of RAT."
2353,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2354,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"The cook she feeds him daily, and he captures all the mice,"
2355,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Which love to haunt the kitchen of the cleanly Bridget Bryce.
2356,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"While little Mikey loves dear Kent far more than all his toys,"
2357,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"And says that he'd rather play with him than any girls or boys,"
2358,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Because he never minds a bit to jump right in the pond
2359,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And bring to land a stick or stone or weeping willow wand.
2360,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2361,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"He always acts politely to all who may come near,"
2362,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And so all strangers pet him and think he is a dear.
2363,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"They like his soft and silky hair, which proves he has good blood,"
2364,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,And never does he make folks mad by tracking floors with mud.
2365,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,
2366,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"He's wiser than most common dogs, whose hair is rough and coarse,"
2367,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"His bark is always pleasant, and 'tis never loud nor hoarse;"
2368,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,"He's swifter also than slow dogs who cannot catch a rat,"
2369,THE PURE-BLOODED PUP,Because they always eat too much and get so very fat.

3116,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"Once on a time, long, long ago, in a far-off foreign land,"
3117,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"A certain king who loved to roam with his chosen courtly band,"
3118,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Was riding abroad one early morn through streets of a city fair
3119,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,When a curious sign above a door caused him to pause and stare.
3120,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,This sign board plainly read to all that here was Wisdom's college
3121,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,With a Professor at its head of UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE.
3122,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"""Ha! Ha!"" loud laughed the wily king while rapping on the door,"
3123,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"""'Tis true above all other men I need a goodly store"
3124,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Of UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE so that I may wisely rule
3125,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"And never say a foolish thing nor act the silly fool."""
3126,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3127,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"But when the great (?) Professor X-- appeared within the door,"
3128,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"With trembling hands and downcast eyes, while bowing to the floor"
3129,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"The king gazed at the coward and this is what he said,"
3130,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"""You answer my three questions or you will lose your head."
3131,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"Now first since you know everything please tell me what I'm worth,"
3132,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And second tell the number of baskets of good earth
3133,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,That one may find by digging within that mountain there
3134,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Reaching with its snow capped crown away up in the air.
3135,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And when you've rightly answered these questions given you
3136,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Then you must tell me of my thoughts to prove your wisdom true.
3137,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Three days is all I'll give you to answer me or go
3138,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"To realms where wisdom surely dwells and something you must know."""
3139,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3140,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"And then the King departed and left the wise man sad,"
3141,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,For though he had some wisdom his little knowledge had
3142,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,But given him the swelled head so foolishly he thought
3143,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Through painted signs of wisdom his knowledge would be sought.
3144,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3145,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"And as this foolish wise man bemoaned his coming doom,"
3146,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"His good but unlearned servant walked into the room,"
3147,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And told his master not to mourn as he would take his place
3148,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And answer the King's questions while gazing in his face.
3149,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,So when three days had passed away the Royal Master came
3150,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And Jim the servant greeted him as if he were the same
3151,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"As he himself or any man who lived upon the earth,"
3152,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And to the world's good Mother Earth was debtor for his birth.
3153,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3154,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"Then spake this servant to the King--""I'm glad my Sire to see"
3155,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And now with pleasure I'll proceed to answer questions three.
3156,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,You're worth how much--not surely more than one wee bit of gold
3157,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,For as you know the Saviour King for thirty bits was sold.
3158,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3159,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,And as to baskets of good earth in yonder mountain high
3160,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,Think not your foolish question has made me sleepless lie.
3161,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,It doesn't even take a man who could be called quite wise
3162,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,To tell you that this all depends upon the basket's size.
3163,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,For if the basket's mountain size of course but one will do
3164,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"But if it's only half as large then we must needs have two."""
3165,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3166,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"Delighted with these answers the King shook Jim's rough hand,"
3167,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"While smiling as he looked at him and gave his last command,"
3168,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"""Now tell me what I'm thinking of, you wizard of the earth,"
3169,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"And if you answer truly, yours is this pearl of worth."""
3170,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"""Oh, that is very simple,"" Jim quickly answered him,"
3171,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"""You think me the professor, but I'm his servant Jim."""
3172,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,
3173,THE KING'S QUESTIONS,"This answer was so pleasing unto the mighty King,"

3182,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"There were many kings of England in ancient Saxon days,"
3183,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,But little to remember except their rude wild ways.
3184,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"There was Egbert and King Ethelwolf and also Ethelbald,"
3185,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Ethelbert and Ethelred and Alfred Great so called.
3186,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3187,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,There was Edward and King Athelstan followed by three kings
3188,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Edmund and King Edgar and one whose praise we sing--
3189,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,The good and kindly Edward who won a martyr's crown;
3190,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then came a second Ethelred, who never won renown;"
3191,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And as this king was always known just by the name ""Unready,"""
3192,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"So his successor well was called--""Strong Edmund ever steady."""
3193,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,And last of all the Saxon kings decreeing England's fate
3194,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Came the Confessor Edward whom we all consider great.
3195,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3196,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And now we come to William, the Norman cruel but brave,"
3197,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And who the throne of England to Norman monarchs gave,"
3198,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"But the royal line he founded had rulers only four,"
3199,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Two Williams and one Henry, one Stephen and no more."
3200,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3201,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Plantagenets just fourteen then came to rule this land,"
3202,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,They formed the longest kingly line and made a goodly band.
3203,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Though they were not all very good and some were very bad,"
3204,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,While some were truly gay old sports and others very sad.
3205,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"The founder was King Henry the second Henry king,"
3206,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"For cruelty to Becket, no praise to him we sing."
3207,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then Richard the Plantagenet, who had a lion heart"
3208,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,And whose brave deeds are greatly praised in history and art.
3209,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then came the trembling coward, the hated ruler John,"
3210,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,How glad are we that from this earth he long ago hath gone!
3211,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3212,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And after followed Henry Third a silly royal goose,"
3213,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Within whose head I sadly fear there were some sutures loose.
3214,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then came the first King Edward who with his warrior band,"
3215,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Laid bare the minstrels' country and their dear mountain land.
3216,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"A second Edward, then a third directly followed after,"
3217,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Then came poor Richard Second who had small cause for laughter;
3218,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Then Henry Fourth who conquered all the lands of goodly Wales
3219,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"As we have often heard in rhyme and in historic tales,"
3220,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And Henry Fifth feared by the French, it was within his reign"
3221,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Fair Joan d'Arc's brave blood was shed the English swords to stain.
3222,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,King Henry Sixth spent his last days in mourning in the Tower
3223,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,While Edward Fourth by might of will possessed the kingly power.
3224,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"The little lad, poor Edward Fifth, was never duly crowned,"
3225,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,But in the Tower cold in death the poor young king was found.
3226,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3227,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,'Tis said that he was murdered by one who then did rule
3228,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"His uncle the third Richard, hump-backed and very cruel."
3229,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"This wicked monster lost his life at Bosworth's bloody field,"
3230,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Then came the Tudor family their scepters strong to wield.
3231,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3232,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Through Henry Seventh and his son King Henry Eighth, the bold,"
3233,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then Edward Sixth, the wise young king who ne'er grew to be old,"
3234,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And monstrous blood-soaked Mary at whose dread bloody name,"
3235,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,All noble English subjects should feel a blush of shame;
3236,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Elizabeth, her sister, the red-haired maiden queen,"
3237,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Who sometimes was quite gracious but had a lot of spleen.
3238,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3239,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,With this great queen the Tudor line came to a glorious end
3240,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then to the Stuarts, six in all, the English knee did bend."
3241,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"First came the learned James the First, and Charles the First, his son,"
3242,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Who through the warrior Cromwell forever was undone.
3243,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"This warrior styled ""Protector"" knew how to rule all men,"
3244,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"If not with his good broadsword, why, then with stroke of pen."
3245,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And after him the second Charles returned to England fair,"
3246,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,And claimed that to her glorious crown he was the lawful heir.
3247,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3248,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then after him the bigot James, the second of his name,"
3249,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Who was deposed from England's throne and earned a crown of shame;
3250,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then good King William called the Third, and Mary, his good wife,"
3251,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"They ruled o'er happy England and banished horrid strife,"
3252,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,But leaving no good children to whom the throne could fall
3253,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Poor sickly Anne, whose heart was big but brains so very small,"
3254,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,As James's second daughter succeeded to the crown
3255,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,And did her best to rule the land but never won renown.
3256,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,To seventeen fair children she in her life gave birth
3257,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,But as death claimed them every one she had no cause for mirth.
3258,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3259,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"The Stuart line was ended with Anne, unhappy queen,"
3260,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then came four kings called Georges, with wits not very keen,"
3261,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Hanover's line they founded, which line rules England now,"
3262,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,And to this line all Englishmen on loyal knee would bow.
3263,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3264,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And after all the Georges had had their rule and died,"
3265,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Then William Fourth, the brother of George the Third, he tried"
3266,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"To rule o'er England's country with kind and steady hand,"
3267,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,But when his brother's daughter succeeded to this land
3268,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,She made a better ruler than any queen or king
3269,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"And to VICTORIA, great VICTORIA, loudest praises ring."
3270,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,
3271,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"She ruled o'er England's empire for years full sixty-four,"
3272,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,And her great crown with queenly grace and kindliness she wore.
3273,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"Her son, King Edward Seventh, the ever tactful king,"
3274,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,Ruled for a few short seasons until by Death's cruel sting
3275,ENGLAND'S KINGS IN RHYME,"His happy reign was ended and George the Fifth, his heir,"

4155,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"Last March, ""Imp March Winds"" teased me so, I had no peace of mind,"
4156,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"For when I took a little walk, these imps came close behind,"
4157,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"And plucked my hat from off my head and hurled it to the ground,"
4158,THE WINDS OF MARCH,Or blew my handkerchief so far it never could be found.
4159,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"So, thinking of the Tangu rug, I asked it to appear"
4160,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"And carry me away to Mars, where I need have no fear"
4161,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"Of being tortured by these imps who love to tease and tease,"
4162,THE WINDS OF MARCH,And never let the big or small feel perfectly at ease.
4163,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"Then on the magic rug I flew away up in the air,"
4164,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"And landed on the planet Mars.   Alas, the imps were there!"
4165,THE WINDS OF MARCH,"And working greater havoc far than they had done on earth,"
4166,THE WINDS OF MARCH,For 'twas indeed the warlike Mars that gave these bad imps birth.

5307,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,"[_Spoken at the Centenary Celebration, April 17th._]"
5308,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,
5309,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,
5310,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,These hoary walls if they could speak
5311,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,What wondrous tales they'd tell!
5312,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Of many strange encounters
5313,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,That long ago befell
5314,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Good Pittsburgh folks who laid these stones
5315,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,One hundred years ago
5316,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,When Uncle Sam looked at John Bull
5317,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,As his most hated foe.
5318,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,"The builders in those good old days,"
5319,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Who fashioned this old wall
5320,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Knew naught of graft or cheap cement:
5321,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,They built things not to fall.
5322,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,And so we see the magazines
5323,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,And walls are just as good
5324,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,As when in days of Lafayette
5325,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,These sturdy bulwarks stood
5326,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,And frowned on him as he passed by
5327,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,"As if they wished to say,"
5328,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,"""Your day will pass but we will stand"
5329,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,"Till centuries roll away."""
5330,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,They heard the dread explosion
5331,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,That shook their very ground
5332,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,But firm they stood as bulwarks
5333,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,When stones fell all around.
5334,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Again when dreadful RIOT
5335,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Brought bloodshed in its path
5336,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,These walls though dyed with crimson
5337,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Looked coldly on man's wrath.
5338,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Not even blood of soldiers
5339,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Could make them shed a tear
5340,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,And that is why these sturdy walls
5341,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Have reached their hundredth year.
5342,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,
5343,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,The moral of this little tale
5344,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,Is that we should not weep and wail
5345,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,But ever put away all fears
5346,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,So we may live a hundred years.
5347,UNCLE SAM'S PITTSBURGH ARSENAL,

5353,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5354,DUX FEMINA VIA,My wise Professor Kurniker
5355,DUX FEMINA VIA,Has not quite wisely said
5356,DUX FEMINA VIA,That masculines in German
5357,DUX FEMINA VIA,Will ever rank ahead.
5358,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5359,DUX FEMINA VIA,"But how about good Mother Earth,"
5360,DUX FEMINA VIA,"The sun, air and the sea,"
5361,DUX FEMINA VIA,Without which not a single soul
5362,DUX FEMINA VIA,Could in existence be?
5363,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5364,DUX FEMINA VIA,Depending on the masculines
5365,DUX FEMINA VIA,We could not even speak
5366,DUX FEMINA VIA,"For we would have no lips, lung, tongue"
5367,DUX FEMINA VIA,Or voices strong or weak.
5368,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5369,DUX FEMINA VIA,What sights we'd be without our skin
5370,DUX FEMINA VIA,And none of us could write
5371,DUX FEMINA VIA,Sans pen and hand and without fists
5372,DUX FEMINA VIA,We could not even fight.
5373,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5374,DUX FEMINA VIA,"What freaks we'd be without our cheeks,"
5375,DUX FEMINA VIA,"Our shoulders, chest and nose"
5376,DUX FEMINA VIA,And how could we walk all about
5377,DUX FEMINA VIA,Unless we had our toes?
5378,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5379,DUX FEMINA VIA,"We'd have no milk to keep us well,"
5380,DUX FEMINA VIA,No butter for our bread.
5381,DUX FEMINA VIA,On most of the delicious fruits
5382,DUX FEMINA VIA,We could not then be fed.
5383,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5384,DUX FEMINA VIA,But few sweet flowers we would have
5385,DUX FEMINA VIA,To cheer the sick and sad;
5386,DUX FEMINA VIA,No lovely pearls of greatest price
5387,DUX FEMINA VIA,To make the ladies glad.
5388,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5389,DUX FEMINA VIA,We would not have a church or bank
5390,DUX FEMINA VIA,Post-office or good school;
5391,DUX FEMINA VIA,"No linen, silk or wool to wear"
5392,DUX FEMINA VIA,When Jack Frost makes us cool.
5393,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5394,DUX FEMINA VIA,We could not patriotic be
5395,DUX FEMINA VIA,With no flag for our own
5396,DUX FEMINA VIA,And without a good naval fleet
5397,DUX FEMINA VIA,We could not stand alone.
5398,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5399,DUX FEMINA VIA,"Without a purse or library,"
5400,DUX FEMINA VIA,"Without a cup for tea,"
5401,DUX FEMINA VIA,Sans the ETERNAL FEMININE
5402,DUX FEMINA VIA,What would this poor world be?
5403,DUX FEMINA VIA,
5404,DUX FEMINA VIA,"Without the seasons and the week,"
5405,DUX FEMINA VIA,"Without the night and stars,"
5406,DUX FEMINA VIA,We'd better leave this mundane sphere
5407,DUX FEMINA VIA,And fly right up to Mars.
5408,DUX FEMINA VIA,

6539,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,[_One of Doctor M. V. O'Shea's Stories Jingled._]
6540,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,
6541,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,
6542,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,The framework of the body is
6543,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"The bones, so teachers say;"
6544,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,And if we didn't have 'em
6545,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Our shape it wouldn't stay.
6546,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Besides sans bones my liver
6547,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,And brains and even heart
6548,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Would get some awful hurtin's
6549,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,And maybe come apart.
6550,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,If my poor bones were badly burned
6551,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"All brittle I would be,"
6552,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Since flames will kill the animal
6553,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,That was born in me;
6554,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,If I were soaked in acid
6555,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,No tender sapling tree
6556,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Would be one-half so limber
6557,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,As just poor little me.
6558,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"But, thinking it all over,"
6559,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,If I should choose my fate
6560,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,I'd rather soak in acid
6561,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Than burn in a hot grate.
6562,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,
6563,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"Some of my bones, the wise men say,"
6564,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"Are very far apart,"
6565,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,While others cling together
6566,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Like jelly in a tart.
6567,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"That is because the bones have joints,"
6568,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"And joints are good to have,"
6569,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,They help me be a pitcher
6570,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,And save me lots of salve.
6571,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,
6572,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,When all my bones are gathered
6573,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,And put in their right place
6574,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"They make a so-called skeleton,"
6575,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,A grinnin' in his face.
6576,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,But if you leave out one small bone
6577,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"Or put one in not right,"
6578,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"It won't be any skeleton,"
6579,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,But a big bony fright.
6580,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,
6581,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,The Exo critters' skeletons
6582,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"Are placed on the outside,"
6583,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"I'm glad I'm not an EXO,"
6584,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,For if my Jane espied
6585,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,Me lookin' like the skeleton
6586,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,"That's shown on teacher's chart,"
6587,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,I know she'd turn her nose right up
6588,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,And say that we must part.
6589,I'M GLAD I'M NOT AN EXO,

7368,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7369,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7370,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The life of Verdi reads as well
7371,GIUSEPPE VERDI,As any fairy tale;
7372,GIUSEPPE VERDI,To interest a girl or boy
7373,GIUSEPPE VERDI,I'm sure it could not fail.
7374,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The stork brought him to Mother Earth
7375,GIUSEPPE VERDI,In time of dreadful strife.
7376,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Hid in an ancient church belfry
7377,GIUSEPPE VERDI,His mother saved his life.
7378,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And in this church which sheltered him
7379,GIUSEPPE VERDI,From cruel blood-thirsty men
7380,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He played as the church organist
7381,GIUSEPPE VERDI,When he was only ten.
7382,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The imps of evil troubled him
7383,GIUSEPPE VERDI,But fairies came along
7384,GIUSEPPE VERDI,To help him in his sorrows
7385,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And fill his heart with song.
7386,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7387,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Like the proverbial mother cat
7388,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Nine lives he seemed to have
7389,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And for each injury received
7390,GIUSEPPE VERDI,There always was some salve.
7391,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Into the water once he fell
7392,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And down he went times three
7393,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Then some one rescued this young lad
7394,GIUSEPPE VERDI,As if by Fate's decree.
7395,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7396,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The poor child yearned for music land
7397,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And also longed for bread.
7398,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And for a girdle round his waist
7399,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"He often wore, 'tis said,"
7400,GIUSEPPE VERDI,A bit of rope which he pulled taut
7401,GIUSEPPE VERDI,When hunger did assail.
7402,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And yet this lad all poorly clad
7403,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And weak and wan and pale
7404,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Forgot his hunger and his wants
7405,GIUSEPPE VERDI,When Music's tones he heard
7406,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"In rippling of the waters bright,"
7407,GIUSEPPE VERDI,In songs of every bird.
7408,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7409,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Close to the fence of a rich man
7410,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Whose daughter played each night
7411,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Verdi when only six years old
7412,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Would listen with delight.
7413,GIUSEPPE VERDI,This hungry lad prayed often there
7414,GIUSEPPE VERDI,That some day he might own
7415,GIUSEPPE VERDI,A lovely spinet in whose keys
7416,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Were fairies' magic tones.
7417,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7418,GIUSEPPE VERDI,One night while it was raining hard
7419,GIUSEPPE VERDI,O'er the high fence he crawled
7420,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"Of an Italian wealthy man,"
7421,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Signor Barezzi called.
7422,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He heard the daughter sweetly play
7423,GIUSEPPE VERDI,A grand Beethoven air
7424,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And while he lay enraptured there
7425,GIUSEPPE VERDI,A coachman found his lair
7426,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And beat the poor starved youngster whom
7427,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"He called a ""dirty thief,"""
7428,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And drove him from the music's reach
7429,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Despite the poor child's grief.
7430,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7431,GIUSEPPE VERDI,But on the next night Verdi went
7432,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Though filled with quaking fear
7433,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And crawled again beneath the fence
7434,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Sweet music there to hear.
7435,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And here Barezzi found the lad
7436,GIUSEPPE VERDI,As by the fence he lay
7437,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And took the boy into his home
7438,GIUSEPPE VERDI,To hear his daughter play.
7439,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7440,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He took an interest in this child
7441,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And placed him in a school
7442,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Where he could learn of music
7443,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Each necessary rule.
7444,GIUSEPPE VERDI,But disappointed he became
7445,GIUSEPPE VERDI,When all the teachers said
7446,GIUSEPPE VERDI,This boy who plays so queerly
7447,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Will never rank ahead;
7448,GIUSEPPE VERDI,As a musician of true worth
7449,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He cannot hold his own
7450,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And in Apollo's circle
7451,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He never will be known.
7452,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7453,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"And so discouraged, this poor lad"
7454,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Became a grocer boy
7455,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Though every night he practised hard--
7456,GIUSEPPE VERDI,This was his only joy.
7457,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And then quite foolishly alas
7458,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The grocer's daughter wed
7459,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And two small children came to him;
7460,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"For them there was no bread,"
7461,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And his young wife and children too
7462,GIUSEPPE VERDI,From dreadful hunger died
7463,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Just when his first great opera
7464,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Most loudly was decried
7465,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And he himself hissed off the stage.
7466,GIUSEPPE VERDI,No wonder that he thought
7467,GIUSEPPE VERDI,This life for him with sorrow's face
7468,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"Forever would be fraught,"
7469,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And it were better now to cross
7470,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The Border-Land's dark path
7471,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Through Suicide's short awful route
7472,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Than live 'neath dark Fate's wrath.
7473,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7474,GIUSEPPE VERDI,But after two sad dreary years
7475,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Of darkness and despair
7476,GIUSEPPE VERDI,His operas succeeded
7477,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And life seemed much more fair.
7478,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He married a good second wife
7479,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And wealthy he became;
7480,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Legion of Honor given him
7481,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Was added to his fame.
7482,GIUSEPPE VERDI,In the Italian parliament
7483,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Verdi received a seat
7484,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And many other honors great
7485,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Were cast down at his feet.
7486,GIUSEPPE VERDI,While his _Il Trovatore_ great
7487,GIUSEPPE VERDI,When first 'twas sung in Rome
7488,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Became so very popular
7489,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"'Twas heard in every home,"
7490,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And e'en to-day in every land
7491,GIUSEPPE VERDI,This opera is played
7492,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And glory for its author
7493,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"Will never, never fade."
7494,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7495,GIUSEPPE VERDI,The name Giuseppe Verdi
7496,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Stands for composer great
7497,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And one whose heart was ever filled
7498,GIUSEPPE VERDI,With love instead of hate.
7499,GIUSEPPE VERDI,But one bad fault this genius had
7500,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"Of flying into fits,"
7501,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And in great anger once he broke
7502,GIUSEPPE VERDI,A spinet into bits.
7503,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And when he taught his pupils
7504,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"He often boxed their ears,"
7505,GIUSEPPE VERDI,So of the music master
7506,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Their hearts were filled with fears.
7507,GIUSEPPE VERDI,
7508,GIUSEPPE VERDI,But he was always good and kind
7509,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"To all the poor and weak,"
7510,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And to help his fellow men
7511,GIUSEPPE VERDI,He would ever seek.
7512,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And when his works brought fame and wealth
7513,GIUSEPPE VERDI,"Barezzi's house he bought,"
7514,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Tore down the fence and made the grounds
7515,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Into a music lot.
7516,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And there this benefactor
7517,GIUSEPPE VERDI,Invited one and all
7518,GIUSEPPE VERDI,To come on every pleasant night
7519,GIUSEPPE VERDI,And hear Apollo's call.

7672,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,"""A doctor you must be, my son,"""
7673,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,"His father sternly said,"
7674,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,But Louis tried to prove to him
7675,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,That music ranks ahead
7676,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,Of all this life's professions
7677,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,And he would like to try

7680,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,
7681,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,"His father laughed his son to scorn,"

7694,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,An English actress he adored
7695,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,And made her his first wife--
7696,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,But little happiness she brought--
7697,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,"Naught but complaints and strife,"
7698,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,As a sad accident befell
7699,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,This one time actress great
7700,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,And as she lay so ill and cross
7701,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,She ever cursed her fate.
7702,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,A baby came into this home;
7703,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,"The hunger wolf came too,"
7704,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,And when the mother left this home
7705,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,He knew not what to do.
7706,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,He married then a second time
7707,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,And sorrows thicker came
7708,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,And soon he lost his only boy
7709,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,In War God's awful game.
7710,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,As he was born 'neath planet Mars
7711,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,"For him there was no peace,"
7712,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,His life was one fierce conflict
7713,LOUIS HECTOR BERLIOZ,Where troubles never cease.
