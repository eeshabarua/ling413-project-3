127,CONFESSION.,CONFESSION.
128,CONFESSION.,
129,CONFESSION.,"I think, by God!  It is no lie;"
130,CONFESSION.,I shall go dreaming till I die!
131,CONFESSION.,There is no love so real to me
132,CONFESSION.,As the cold passion of the sea.
133,CONFESSION.,"There is no little, wind-swept town"
134,CONFESSION.,"By harbors where the roads go down,"
135,CONFESSION.,Or headland gray that sits and sips
136,CONFESSION.,"The cup of ocean at its lips,"
137,CONFESSION.,And gazes at the far-off ships--
138,CONFESSION.,Or tree or house or friend so real
139,CONFESSION.,As visions and the dreams I feel.
140,CONFESSION.,
141,CONFESSION.,"No--not the windy, vaultless arch"
142,CONFESSION.,"Where all the white stars flame and march,"
143,CONFESSION.,Nor water at the river fords
144,CONFESSION.,"Like horses mad among the swords,"
145,CONFESSION.,Or oaks that lean from winter storms;
146,CONFESSION.,These only give my vision forms.
147,CONFESSION.,
148,CONFESSION.,"Away!  White hands, I will not take!"
149,CONFESSION.,"And kissing mouths that cry, ""Awake!"""
150,CONFESSION.,For you I have no gramercy;
151,CONFESSION.,"So leave me by my lotus tree,"
152,CONFESSION.,To dream and gaze into the sky
153,CONFESSION.,"Where red suns wither up and die,"
154,CONFESSION.,I know!  I know!  I do not lie!
155,CONFESSION.,I shall go dreaming till I die!
156,CONFESSION.,
157,CONFESSION.,
158,CONFESSION.,
159,CONFESSION.,
160,DESPAIR.,DESPAIR.
161,DESPAIR.,
162,DESPAIR.,You who made me
163,DESPAIR.,With first ecstasy
164,DESPAIR.,"When I was sown,"
165,DESPAIR.,And lovely things at night
166,DESPAIR.,I will not write
167,DESPAIR.,"And burdened moan,"
168,DESPAIR.,While veiny labyrinths with mystery ran
169,DESPAIR.,Till time and blood were life
170,DESPAIR.,And I began--
171,DESPAIR.,"By holier things than God,"
172,DESPAIR.,"Or any other shibboleth of man,"
173,DESPAIR.,"Dead woman wan,"
174,DESPAIR.,"By the thin, silver scream that winter morn"
175,DESPAIR.,"In the dim, shuttered room where I was born,"
176,DESPAIR.,Be gone!
177,DESPAIR.,
178,DESPAIR.,"Haunt me no more, Shroud Trailer,"
179,DESPAIR.,Go to bed.
180,DESPAIR.,"For the swift, golden wings I owe to you"
181,DESPAIR.,"Flap in the dust like some loose, common shoe;"
182,DESPAIR.,"Stay dead, stay dead!"
183,DESPAIR.,"I fear your glimmering bust in utter air,"
184,DESPAIR.,"The transparent eyes with shadowy stare,"
185,DESPAIR.,"The sleepy, sleepy scent of flowers"
186,DESPAIR.,And the long hands--
187,DESPAIR.,They fill me with despair.
188,DESPAIR.,
189,DESPAIR.,Touch me no more at night.
190,DESPAIR.,Borrow no form for me
191,DESPAIR.,Of sound or sight;
192,DESPAIR.,"For all my days are spent by cluttered streams,"
193,DESPAIR.,"Distracted by a thousand things and faces,"
194,DESPAIR.,And all unuttered die great dreams
195,DESPAIR.,Among the stagnant places.
196,DESPAIR.,"I am not what you gave your life to buy,"
197,DESPAIR.,And God knows what I shall be by and by!
198,DESPAIR.,"The motes of habit sift down grain by grain,"
199,DESPAIR.,"Till I am what I am in heart and brain,"
200,DESPAIR.,So young--so old--
201,DESPAIR.,"Death keep you, darling,"
202,DESPAIR.,Deaf and blind and cold.
203,DESPAIR.,
204,DESPAIR.,
205,DESPAIR.,
206,DESPAIR.,
207,VALE.,VALE.
208,VALE.,
209,VALE.,"I love the little vale between your breasts,"
210,VALE.,"But yet, farewell, for that is never still;"
211,VALE.,My garden far from you will be at rest
212,VALE.,With lakes asleep beside a brooding hill
213,VALE.,And cedar swales in hollow valley lands
214,VALE.,"With S-like streams between the O-shaped ponds,"
215,VALE.,Where grow frail ferns with upturned Gothic hands
216,VALE.,And prayerful fronds.
217,VALE.,
218,VALE.,In gray half-lights 'twill be a lovely thing
219,VALE.,By Gypsy paths to wander at hearts-ease
220,VALE.,Near campaniles where the bell folk sing
221,VALE.,"Down terraces of rustling linden trees,"
222,VALE.,"And two hills like your breasts will be in death,"
223,VALE.,"When lamps will cast their shadows silently,"
224,VALE.,Will rise still blue above the yellow corn
225,VALE.,That ripples with a sleepy mystery.

230,AFTERMATH.,AFTERMATH.
231,AFTERMATH.,
232,AFTERMATH.,Under the placid surface of the days
233,AFTERMATH.,"So seeming clear,"
234,AFTERMATH.,"Back of the habits of old ways,"
235,AFTERMATH.,A quiet fear;
236,AFTERMATH.,"The locked-up memories of war,"
237,AFTERMATH.,"Our Bluebeard's room,"
238,AFTERMATH.,Where the blood creeps underneath the door.
239,AFTERMATH.,
240,AFTERMATH.,Never will come
241,AFTERMATH.,In streams of days that ring
242,AFTERMATH.,"Like clean coins down the merry grooves of change,"
243,AFTERMATH.,"One without grief's alloy,"
244,AFTERMATH.,"Struck from pure gold of joy,"
245,AFTERMATH.,"Undimmed by unshed tears,"
246,AFTERMATH.,Nor is it strange.
247,AFTERMATH.,
248,AFTERMATH.,For in the wraith-thronged brain
249,AFTERMATH.,"Are private ghosts of pain,"
250,AFTERMATH.,"Aloof, like patient sick men in a crowd"
251,AFTERMATH.,With half-veiled faces and old sorrow bowed--
252,AFTERMATH.,Ah!  The free days can never come again!
253,AFTERMATH.,"They passed with the far, rolling drums,"
254,AFTERMATH.,"Died to the moan and thunder of the guns,"
255,AFTERMATH.,"And the mad, glad, clear, lyric birdsong never comes."

260,HYLAS.,HYLAS.
261,HYLAS.,
262,HYLAS.,"_Theocritus, Idyll XIII._"
263,HYLAS.,
264,HYLAS.,"_Where art thou, Hylas,"
265,HYLAS.,Of the golden locks?
266,HYLAS.,"Where art thou, Argive lad,"
267,HYLAS.,That fed thy flocks
268,HYLAS.,"In wind-swept Thessaly,"
269,HYLAS.,Beside the sea?
270,HYLAS.,"Alas!  Alas! for thee,"
271,HYLAS.,"Hylas, Alas!_"
272,HYLAS.,
273,HYLAS.,
274,HYLAS.,
275,I.,I.
276,I.,
277,I.,When the Pleiads rose no more
278,I.,"Rowed the heroes to the shore,"
279,I.,"Much in fear of winter gales,"
280,I.,"And they furled the wing-like sails,"
281,I.,Carrying up the corded bales
282,I.,"From the hollow, oaken Argo"
283,I.,Till they lightened her of cargo.
284,I.,Then they beached her for the winter
285,I.,Where nor rocks nor waves could splinter
286,I.,There the heroes made their camp
287,I.,"By the whispering seashore damp,"
288,I.,"But the mighty Heracles,"
289,I.,"Tired of looking at the seas,"
290,I.,Rose and left those sounding beaches
291,I.,For the upland's wind-swept reaches.
292,I.,
293,I.,In a little beechwood gray
294,I.,"Hylas fed his flock that day,"
295,I.,Playing all alone but gayly
296,I.,"Where he fed his lambkins daily,"
297,I.,Singing to a five-stringed psalter
298,I.,"By a little woodland altar,"
299,I.,Where a shepherd's fire of oak
300,I.,"Made a ribbon scarf of smoke,"
301,I.,"Curling highly, thinly, bluely,"
302,I.,From the faggots cut but newly.
303,I.,
304,I.,"Moving with a god-like ease,"
305,I.,"Through the gray boles of the trees,"
306,I.,"Hylas first spied Heracles,"
307,I.,"Looming vast as huge Orion,"
308,I.,Tawny in his skin of lion;
309,I.,"While through interspace of leaves,"
310,I.,"Through the network autumn weaves,"
311,I.,Fell bronze sunshine and bronze leaves
312,I.,"On the lion skin with its paws,"
313,I.,"Dangling, fringed with crescent claws."
314,I.,
315,I.,Softly all the flock were bleating
316,I.,"As he gave the lad good greeting,"
317,I.,"Rubbing down with leaves his club,"
318,I.,Mighty as a chariot hub--
319,I.,"Hylas stood with golden locks,"
320,I.,"Glowing mid the lichened rocks,"
321,I.,"Laughing in the silver beeches,"
322,I.,White as milk and tanned like peaches.
323,I.,"Then the hero loved the lad,"
324,I.,"For his beauty made him glad,"
325,I.,And he took him on his knees;
326,I.,"Tender was huge Heracles,"
327,I.,Telling him of strange journeys
328,I.,"To the far Hesperides,"
329,I.,"Crossing oceans in a bowl,"
330,I.,Till he won him heart and soul.
331,I.,
332,I.,"So these two were friends forever,"
333,I.,"Never seen apart, together"
334,I.,Were they all that winter weather.
335,I.,And the hero taught the youth
336,I.,"How to shoot and tell the truth,"
337,I.,"How to drive a furrow straight,"
338,I.,"Plowing, plowing, very early"
339,I.,When the frosty grass was curly--
340,I.,"Taught him how to play the lyre,"
341,I.,"Till each wire, and wire, and wire"
342,I.,Sang together like a choir;
343,I.,And at night young Hylas crept
344,I.,In the lion skin where he slept
345,I.,Where the lowing oxen team
346,I.,"Stood beneath the smoke-browned beam,"
347,I.,Slept beside the hero clypt
348,I.,"By the giant, downy lipped."
349,I.,
350,I.,_Centuries have fled away
351,I.,Since the hero came that day
352,I.,To the little beechwood gray
353,I.,Where young Hylas was at play;
354,I.,"But I shall, as poets may,"
355,I.,"Wreathe these roses for his head,"
356,I.,For his beauty is not dead.
357,I.,And a voice has sung to me
358,I.,"Like a memory of the sea,"
359,I.,"Sung this ancient threnody,"
360,I.,Like an autumn melody:
361,I.,"""Alas!  Alas!  for thee,"
362,I.,"Hylas, Alas!""_"
363,I.,
364,I.,
365,I.,
366,II.,II.
367,II.,
368,II.,When the springtime came again
369,II.,And the shepherd to his spen
370,II.,"Led his cloudy flock again,"
371,II.,When the awkward lambkins bounded
372,II.,"While the twin pipes whistling sounded,"
373,II.,And old Charon from his glen
374,II.,Saw below the smoke of men
375,II.,"Curling thinly from the trees,"
376,II.,Then the heroes sought the seas.
377,II.,"Then the Argo left the shore,"
378,II.,"For each eager warrior thought,"
379,II.,"When the Pleiads rose once more,"
380,II.,Of the golden fleece he sought.
381,II.,
382,II.,"Hylas went with Heracles,"
383,II.,"Dancing to the dancing seas,"
384,II.,"And he stood high in the bow,"
385,II.,"Golden by the carven prow,"
386,II.,Or he lay within the furls
387,II.,With the sea damp on his curls.
388,II.,But at home his mother wept
389,II.,"With her hair upon the floor,"
390,II.,"By the hearth where he had slept,"
391,II.,"For her woman's heart was sore,"
392,II.,"Saying, ""He is gone from me!"
393,II.,Gone across the sounding sea!
394,II.,Ai!  Ai!  Woe is me!
395,II.,"Alas!  Alas! for thee,"
396,II.,"Hylas, Alas!"""
397,II.,
398,II.,"With the soft, south wind to follow"
399,II.,"All the day the sail was hollow,"
400,II.,"While the marvelous Orpheus sang,"
401,II.,Till the water furrows rang--
402,II.,Never man sang as he sang--
403,II.,Never man has sung the same--
404,II.,And the ship flew till they came
405,II.,Where the olive trees are gaunt
406,II.,"By the winding Hellespont,"
407,II.,And the Cian oxen wear
408,II.,Water-bright the bronze plowshare.
409,II.,
410,II.,"On a fallow meadow hollow,"
411,II.,"Where the Cian cattle wallow,"
412,II.,There they landed two by two;
413,II.,They the grass and rushes strew
414,II.,"For their bed,"
415,II.,"Leaves and pointed flag stocks callow,"
416,II.,Foot and head.
417,II.,"And the evening coming on,"
418,II.,Heracles and Telamon
419,II.,Set the supper fires upleaping
420,II.,"And the shadows swooping, sweeping"
421,II.,Overhead.
422,II.,"Meanwhile, Hylas with a vase"
423,II.,"Wandered inland through the haze,"
424,II.,"Hoping there to fill his bronze,"
425,II.,"Girt about with goat-foot fauns,"
426,II.,Polished.
427,II.,"And around and twice around it,"
428,II.,"Where an inwrought girdle bound it,"
429,II.,"Fled the rout of chaste Diana,"
430,II.,Goddess led.
431,II.,
432,II.,Inland in a cup-shaped vale
433,II.,Willow swart and galingale
434,II.,Grew with swallowwort and sparsely
435,II.,"Maidenhair and blooming parsley,"
436,II.,And the shallow's level glass
437,II.,Mirrored back the yellow grass
438,II.,"Where the swallow dipped his wings,"
439,II.,Making rings on rings in rings.
440,II.,There a nymph dance was afoot
441,II.,Where the country people put
442,II.,Cloth and oaten cakes and bread
443,II.,For the water spirits dread--
444,II.,"Two and two and in and out,"
445,II.,"Three and two, around about,"
446,II.,"Hands around and then they vanished,"
447,II.,Leaving Hylas there astonished.
448,II.,
449,II.,But at last he stooped to dip
450,II.,"And the eager water slipped,"
451,II.,"Stuttering past the metal lip,"
452,II.,Choking like a sunk bell rung--
453,II.,Suddenly white nymph hands clung
454,II.,Cold as iron around his arm
455,II.,Till he cried out in alarm.
456,II.,Gave a little silver cry
457,II.,And the swallow skimming nigh
458,II.,"Darted higher in the sky,"
459,II.,And the echo when he spoke--
460,II.,Awoke.
461,II.,"Now the white hands tighter cling,"
462,II.,Now the funneled water ring
463,II.,Fills and flows till in its glass
464,II.,Nods again the nodding grass.
465,II.,"_Alas!  Alas! for thee,"
466,II.,"Hylas, Alas!_"
467,II.,
468,II.,Then it was that Heracles
469,II.,"For sweet Hylas ill at ease,"
470,II.,"Left the heroes by the fire,"
471,II.,"Strung his bowstring taut as wire,"
472,II.,Went to look for Hylas inland
473,II.,"Past a little rocky headland,"
474,II.,Rising higher ever higher
475,II.,"Till he found the cup-shaped dale,"
476,II.,"Where he called without avail,"
477,II.,"Shouting loudly, ""Hylas, Hylas,"""
478,II.,"Echo answered back, ""Alas,"""
479,II.,"Echo answered very slowly,"
480,II.,"Speaking sorrowfully and lowly,"
481,II.,"When he called the lad, ""Hy-_las_,"""
482,II.,"Hollow echo said, ""Alas."""
483,II.,
484,II.,And he never found him more
485,II.,"On the hill or by the shore,"
486,II.,"On the upland, on the downland,"
487,II.,Never found him where he lay
488,II.,"Down among the boulders gray,"
489,II.,"Limp among the watery rocks,"
490,II.,Where the lily raised its chalice
491,II.,"And the dread nymphs combed his locks,"
492,II.,"Pale Nycheia, April-eyed,"
493,II.,And white Eunice and Malis.
494,II.,For his voice came down to these
495,II.,"Vague as April in the trees,"
496,II.,Filtered through the water clear
497,II.,"Far and faint yet strangely near,"
498,II.,Very thin--
499,II.,And no echo could they hear
500,II.,Only ripples' silver din
501,II.,And the dull splash of an otter;
502,II.,Echo cannot live in water.
503,II.,
504,II.,But that echo comes to me
505,II.,Down through half eternity
506,II.,"Crying out, ""Alas--Alas!"""
507,II.,For all beauty that must pass
508,II.,Like a picture from a glass--
509,II.,When time breathes it is not there--
510,II.,Bony hands and coffined hair!
511,II.,Alas!  Alas!  Alas!
512,II.,
513,II.,
514,II.,
515,II.,
516,BACCHUS IS GONE.,BACCHUS IS GONE.
517,BACCHUS IS GONE.,
518,BACCHUS IS GONE.,_Bacchus is gone_!

1069,IV.,[Sidenote: But the world still thinks the king mad.]
1070,IV.,

1407,THE OLD JUDGE.,"Of frosty marches,"

1415,THE OLD JUDGE.,The blood can scarcely creep
1416,THE OLD JUDGE.,Back to the icy feet

1459,BEWITCHED.,Often they used to walk
1460,BEWITCHED.,"Hand fast in hand,"
1461,BEWITCHED.,"And laughed and kissed,"
1462,BEWITCHED.,Lost in such heavenly talk
1463,BEWITCHED.,"That spirits there,"
1464,BEWITCHED.,"Who dwelt in sunny places in the mist,"
1465,BEWITCHED.,"Drew very near to Véronique and Pierre,"
1466,BEWITCHED.,"And the shrill curlews cried,"

1470,BEWITCHED.,"Mornings, dear Véronique brought shells"

1473,BEWITCHED.,"Washed from old ocean's dragon-haunted floor,"
1474,BEWITCHED.,And Pierre would dream that she was sitting there
1475,BEWITCHED.,And hoped that he would find her when he woke;
1476,BEWITCHED.,And so he did--and she would look at Pierre
1477,BEWITCHED.,And he at her--and neither of them spoke.
1478,BEWITCHED.,"So passed July, whose molten hours flow,"
1479,BEWITCHED.,"The sun laughed hot and high,"
1480,BEWITCHED.,"And then they said good-bye,"

1482,BEWITCHED.,"He left her standing dumbly in the lane,"

1485,BEWITCHED.,"_Bewitched!  Bewitched!_  With melancholy spell,"

1524,THE BLINDMAN.,
1525,THE BLINDMAN.,"At Nogent, on the river Marne,"
1526,THE BLINDMAN.,I passed a burning house and barn.
1527,THE BLINDMAN.,I went into the public square
1528,THE BLINDMAN.,Where pigeons fluttered in the air
1529,THE BLINDMAN.,And empty windows gaped a-stare.
1530,THE BLINDMAN.,
1531,THE BLINDMAN.,There crouched a blindman by the wall
1532,THE BLINDMAN.,"A-shivering in a ragged shawl,"
1533,THE BLINDMAN.,Who gave a hopeless parrot screech
1534,THE BLINDMAN.,And felt the wall with halting reach.
1535,THE BLINDMAN.,He went around as in a trap.
1536,THE BLINDMAN.,He had a stick to feel and rap.
1537,THE BLINDMAN.,"_A-rap-a-tap, a-rap-a-tap_."
1538,THE BLINDMAN.,
1539,THE BLINDMAN.,I strode across the public square.
1540,THE BLINDMAN.,I stopped and spoke him full and fair.
1541,THE BLINDMAN.,I asked him what he searched for there.
1542,THE BLINDMAN.,There came a look upon his face
1543,THE BLINDMAN.,That made me want to leave the place.
1544,THE BLINDMAN.,He could not answer for a space.
1545,THE BLINDMAN.,He moved his trembling hands about
1546,THE BLINDMAN.,"And in-and-out, and in-and-out."
1547,THE BLINDMAN.,
1548,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Kind sir,"" he said, ""I scarcely know--"
1549,THE BLINDMAN.,A week ago there fell a blow--
1550,THE BLINDMAN.,I think it was a week ago.
1551,THE BLINDMAN.,"I sent my little girl to school,"
1552,THE BLINDMAN.,"With kisses and her book and rule,"
1553,THE BLINDMAN.,"A week ago she went to school."""
1554,THE BLINDMAN.,"The pigeons all began to coo,"
1555,THE BLINDMAN.,"""_A-cock-a-loo, a-cock-a-loo._"""
1556,THE BLINDMAN.,
1557,THE BLINDMAN.,"""O God! to be a blinded fool;"
1558,THE BLINDMAN.,I cannot find the children's school--
1559,THE BLINDMAN.,"The gate, the court about the pool--"
1560,THE BLINDMAN.,"But, sir, if you will guide my feet"
1561,THE BLINDMAN.,"Across the square and down the street,"
1562,THE BLINDMAN.,I think I know then where it lies.

1565,THE BLINDMAN.,
1566,THE BLINDMAN.,"I led him down the littered street,"
1567,THE BLINDMAN.,"He seemed to know it with his feet,"
1568,THE BLINDMAN.,For suddenly he turned aside
1569,THE BLINDMAN.,And entered through a gateway wide.
1570,THE BLINDMAN.,It was the court about the pool.
1571,THE BLINDMAN.,Long shadows slept there deep and cool.
1572,THE BLINDMAN.,No sound was there of beast or bird;
1573,THE BLINDMAN.,It was the silence that we heard.
1574,THE BLINDMAN.,
1575,THE BLINDMAN.,"""And this,"" he said, ""might be the place,"""
1576,THE BLINDMAN.,An eager look came on his face.
1577,THE BLINDMAN.,He raised his voice and gave a call;
1578,THE BLINDMAN.,"An echo mewed along the wall,"
1579,THE BLINDMAN.,"And then it rose, and then it fell,"
1580,THE BLINDMAN.,Like children talking down a well.
1581,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Go in,"" he said, ""see what you see,"

1586,THE BLINDMAN.,A turn--and halfway up the stair
1587,THE BLINDMAN.,There was a sight to raise your hair;
1588,THE BLINDMAN.,"A dusty litter, books and toys,"
1589,THE BLINDMAN.,"Three bundles that were little boys,"
1590,THE BLINDMAN.,White faces like an ivory gem;
1591,THE BLINDMAN.,A statue stood and looked at them.
1592,THE BLINDMAN.,
1593,THE BLINDMAN.,"So thick the silence where I stood,"
1594,THE BLINDMAN.,I thought I wore a woolen hood;
1595,THE BLINDMAN.,"The blood went whispering through my ears,"
1596,THE BLINDMAN.,Like secrets that one overhears.
1597,THE BLINDMAN.,I looked upon the dead a while;
1598,THE BLINDMAN.,I saw the glimmering statue smile.
1599,THE BLINDMAN.,"The children slept so sweetly there,"
1600,THE BLINDMAN.,I scarce believed the tainted air.
1601,THE BLINDMAN.,
1602,THE BLINDMAN.,"And then I heard the blindman's stick,"
1603,THE BLINDMAN.,"As rhythmic as a watch's tick,"
1604,THE BLINDMAN.,"_A step--a click, a step--a click--_"
1605,THE BLINDMAN.,"As slow as days grow to a year,"
1606,THE BLINDMAN.,"So long it seemed while he drew near,"
1607,THE BLINDMAN.,"But sure and blind as death or fate,"
1608,THE BLINDMAN.,"He came and said, ""I dared not wait."
1609,THE BLINDMAN.,"It was too silent at the gate."""
1610,THE BLINDMAN.,
1611,THE BLINDMAN.,"""And tell me now, sir, what you see"
1612,THE BLINDMAN.,"That keeps you here so silently."""
1613,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Three harmless things,"" I said, ""I fear,"

1615,THE BLINDMAN.,"Three shadows of what was before,"
1616,THE BLINDMAN.,"Cast by no light are on the floor."""
1617,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Sir,"" said the blindman, ""lead me round,"
1618,THE BLINDMAN.,"Lest I should tread on holy ground."""
1619,THE BLINDMAN.,
1620,THE BLINDMAN.,"Like men they lead at dawn to doom,"
1621,THE BLINDMAN.,We slowly climbed the stairway's gloom
1622,THE BLINDMAN.,And came into a sunlit room.
1623,THE BLINDMAN.,"The ceiling lay upon the floor,"
1624,THE BLINDMAN.,"And slates, and books, and something more--"
1625,THE BLINDMAN.,"The master with a glassy stare,"
1626,THE BLINDMAN.,Sat gory in his shivered chair
1627,THE BLINDMAN.,And gazed upon his pupils there.
1628,THE BLINDMAN.,
1629,THE BLINDMAN.,The blindman grasped me eagerly.
1630,THE BLINDMAN.,"""And tell me now, sir, what you see?"
1631,THE BLINDMAN.,This is the place where she should be--
1632,THE BLINDMAN.,"My Eleanor, who used to wear"
1633,THE BLINDMAN.,Short socks that left her brown legs bare.
1634,THE BLINDMAN.,"She had a crown of golden hair."""
1635,THE BLINDMAN.,I saw his blind eyes peer and stare.
1636,THE BLINDMAN.,"_Now there and here, now here and there_."
1637,THE BLINDMAN.,
1638,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Blindman,"" I cried, ""these things I see:"
1639,THE BLINDMAN.,Time here has turned eternity.
1640,THE BLINDMAN.,"The clock hands point but only mock,"
1641,THE BLINDMAN.,For it is always three o'clock.
1642,THE BLINDMAN.,I see the shadows on the wall;
1643,THE BLINDMAN.,"I see the crumbling plaster fall."""
1644,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Oh! sir,"" he said, ""I crave your eyes--"
1645,THE BLINDMAN.,"Be not so kindly with your lies."""
1646,THE BLINDMAN.,
1647,THE BLINDMAN.,I drew the blindman to my side;
1648,THE BLINDMAN.,I told the truth I wished to hide.
1649,THE BLINDMAN.,"I said, ""I see your Eleanor"
1650,THE BLINDMAN.,And she is dead upon the floor.
1651,THE BLINDMAN.,And something fumbles with her hair;
1652,THE BLINDMAN.,I guess the wind is playing there.
1653,THE BLINDMAN.,And I see gray rats sleek and stout
1654,THE BLINDMAN.,"That dart about and dart about."""
1655,THE BLINDMAN.,
1656,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Now, sir,"" he said, ""I love your lies"
1657,THE BLINDMAN.,And Christ be thanked that took my eyes!
1658,THE BLINDMAN.,"But lead me, lead me to my dead!"
1659,THE BLINDMAN.,"And let me touch her once,"" he said."
1660,THE BLINDMAN.,I placed his hand upon her head.
1661,THE BLINDMAN.,
1662,THE BLINDMAN.,"And when we left the charnel place,"
1663,THE BLINDMAN.,I dared not look upon his face;
1664,THE BLINDMAN.,For suddenly upon the street
1665,THE BLINDMAN.,"Arose the sound of trampling feet,"
1666,THE BLINDMAN.,"And wheels that rumbled on the ground,"
1667,THE BLINDMAN.,"_And ground around and ground around_,"
1668,THE BLINDMAN.,"The din of them that go to slay,"
1669,THE BLINDMAN.,"The shout of men and horses' neigh,"
1670,THE BLINDMAN.,And men and beasts swept on to war
1671,THE BLINDMAN.,A dreadful drumming on before.
1672,THE BLINDMAN.,
1673,THE BLINDMAN.,"It throbbed and throbbed through Nogent Town,"
1674,THE BLINDMAN.,Till desolation settled down.
1675,THE BLINDMAN.,The blindman leaned against the door;
1676,THE BLINDMAN.,"""And tell me, sir, about the war,"
1677,THE BLINDMAN.,"What is it they are fighting for?"""
1678,THE BLINDMAN.,"""Blindman,"" I cried, ""Can you not see?"

1828,BEAUMONT.,
1829,BEAUMONT.,"Deep in the mystery of the woodland's gloom,"
1830,BEAUMONT.,"Topping the sea of trees with pointed cone,"
1831,BEAUMONT.,"So that from many hills its towers loom,"
1832,BEAUMONT.,The old château of Beaumont stands alone.
1833,BEAUMONT.,This generation saw its last sons go
1834,BEAUMONT.,To spill their noble blood with humbler men;
1835,BEAUMONT.,So Madame lives alone at the château
1836,BEAUMONT.,And waits for steps that never come again.
1837,BEAUMONT.,"The sunlight sleeps along the buttressed walls,"
1838,BEAUMONT.,"And on the stagnant moats the midges dance,"
1839,BEAUMONT.,"And in the haunted wood the cuckoo calls,"
1840,BEAUMONT.,Where hunted once the vanished kings of France.
1841,BEAUMONT.,"The terraced gardens hum with greedy bees,"

1844,BEAUMONT.,Boxed orange shrubs--they stand in potted row
1845,BEAUMONT.,Along the plaisance--Madame takes her ease;
1846,BEAUMONT.,But it is lonely at the old château;
1847,BEAUMONT.,"The milky statues glimmer through the trees,"
1848,BEAUMONT.,"So silent, too!  What can make Madame start?"
1849,BEAUMONT.,"Down in the garden where late roses blow,"
1850,BEAUMONT.,She has heard laughter there that stopt her heart
1851,BEAUMONT.,Like echoes from old summers long ago.
1852,BEAUMONT.,But no--it cannot be!  For hark! the click
1853,BEAUMONT.,Of little peasants' sabots; down the walk
1854,BEAUMONT.,"That winds among the rows of hedges thick,"
1855,BEAUMONT.,The children's voices die away in talk.
1856,BEAUMONT.,"Alas!  Who knows, who knows,"
1857,BEAUMONT.,Why Madame bends so long above the rose?

1861,BEAUMONT.,Yet there is peace for you to outward sense--
1862,BEAUMONT.,God gives you Beaumont as a place to live.
1863,BEAUMONT.,"The white herds graze in stately indolence,"
1864,BEAUMONT.,"While you sit knitting on the terrace there,"
1865,BEAUMONT.,"And that your hands still feel no impotence,"
1866,BEAUMONT.,Witness the poor and _Croix Rouge_ at St. Pierre;
1867,BEAUMONT.,"And sweet the drive home through the wooded park,"
1868,BEAUMONT.,When faintly chime the far-off steeple clocks
1869,BEAUMONT.,"At dusk when village dogs begin to bark,"
1870,BEAUMONT.,"And the long lanes go glimmering white with flocks,"
1871,BEAUMONT.,"When the first, steely stars begin to peep"
