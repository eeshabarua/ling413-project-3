91,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
92,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
93,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Oh, Titan was her gorgeous armament"
94,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And Titan was her sail and crew;
95,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,A thing of pride to sweep the surging tide
96,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And laugh to scorn the perilous blue.
97,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Yet let us weep not for her treasured hulk
98,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"That sank leagues deep into the sea,"
99,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,But for the toll of ill-starred voyagers
100,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Who rode her to eternity.
101,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
102,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,I see the glory of that primal hour
103,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"When first her beams did breast the wave,--"
104,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Yea, owner, builder, seaman’s eyes did sparkle"
105,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,As did the sea her huge side lave:--
106,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,How zealously the elite madly rushed
107,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"To trust their passage in her care,"
108,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,To boast their presence on the maiden trip
109,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Of that leviathan so rare.
110,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
111,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"She sailed.--The sky gleamed bright and azure clear,"
112,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"The waves lashed gently at her side,"
113,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,The moon that night shone down auspiciously
114,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Upon that ship of gorgeous pride.
115,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Her engines tore in frenzy o’er and o’er,"
116,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Her powerful shafts did heave and quake,"
117,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"As loud and clear her captain’s voice rang out,"
118,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,“Speed on! Fear not the iceberg’s brake.”
119,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
120,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Ahead there floundered in the chilly sea
121,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,A huge and bristling wall of ice.
122,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,“What shall we do?” her helmsman tremulously cried.
123,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Word came, “Let’s cleave it in a trice,”"
124,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Whereat the mighty engines creaked and strained
125,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And madly sped the Titan hulk.
126,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Ne’er moved nor stirred the ocean’s icy berg,"
127,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,But braced against her speeding bulk.
128,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
129,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"“Dost thou defy me, master of the sea,"
130,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Thou untried artifice of man?
131,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"I’ll show thee, then, whose is the stronger hand,"
132,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,For mine was here e’er thine began.”
133,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Crash! Crash! The waters rushed. The ship’s side heaved.
134,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"The ponderous engines ceased to throb,"
135,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And there above the darkening drawbridge cried
136,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,A thousand souls in fear to God.
137,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
138,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"From peaceful slumbers wildly they uprose,"
139,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"From games of whist, from dance and wine."
140,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,“Can it be so?” they cried in anguished pride--
141,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,“So sinking in the icy brine?”
142,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,But ah! alas! the hand of death hung o’er.
143,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Alas for captain, ship and crew!"
144,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,In headstrong haste they’d left the boats behind
145,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,That save men from the watery blue.
146,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
147,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"“Let there be women saved, and they alone!”"
148,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Rose up like steel the chivalrous cry,"
149,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,While gallant men stood on the slippery deck
150,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And brave resolved themselves to die.
151,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Then solemn strains rose from the engulfing main,"
152,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"“Nearer my God,” they sang, “to Thee,”"
153,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Till all that was left of the Titan’s envied hulk
154,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Was a billowy gurgle in the sea.
155,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
156,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Alas for man! Alas for vaunting boast!
157,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Which seeks to conquer the fate of the sea,"
158,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Essays to raise proud hulks of iron and steel
159,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And laugh to scorn God’s mastery!
160,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Thus from their watery grave he lifts his voice;
161,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,“None tempt my power by craft malign.
162,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Lo! all shall cleave unto the common end,"
163,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And none shall stand but I, divine!”"

173,INSPIRATION,"Stand not abashed, nor fear the tow’ring steep"
174,INSPIRATION,"Which thou wouldst climb, but bend thy will--"
175,INSPIRATION,"That magic wand of every earthly deed,"
176,INSPIRATION,The power that peopleth worlds and raiseth thrones--
177,INSPIRATION,"And upwards mount. Thou hast thy heart’s want now,"

186,SPRING BALLAD,"Spring, Spring, O gentle Spring, where hast thou been so long?"
187,SPRING BALLAD,Why hast thou not come sooner to me?
188,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
189,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
190,SPRING BALLAD,"I am faint for thy smile, as I watched the long while"
191,SPRING BALLAD,"Thy merry, rollicksome face to see."
192,SPRING BALLAD,
193,SPRING BALLAD,"Spring, Spring, O gentle Spring, why wast thou silent so long?"
194,SPRING BALLAD,Why didst thou not answer my reverent call?
195,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
196,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
197,SPRING BALLAD,"Come forth, from glade or glen, from vale or hill, from bog or fen,"
198,SPRING BALLAD,And flutter thy magical wand high over all.
199,SPRING BALLAD,
200,SPRING BALLAD,"But lo! now thou art come, with thy wonderful train,"
201,SPRING BALLAD,Never so bright and never so gay.
202,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
203,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
204,SPRING BALLAD,Thy throne they prepare in the heights of the air

207,SPRING BALLAD,"Thy wonderful reign has begun with the rise of the sun,"
208,SPRING BALLAD,"All heaven and earth but wait on thee now,"
209,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
210,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
211,SPRING BALLAD,I smell thy sweet flowers and thy odorous bowers
212,SPRING BALLAD,And see the green trees before thee to bow.
213,SPRING BALLAD,
214,SPRING BALLAD,"The robins have come from their faraway home,"
215,SPRING BALLAD,And I hear their sweet songs to burst forth again.
216,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
217,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
218,SPRING BALLAD,Thou mak’st their tones rise up to the azure skies
219,SPRING BALLAD,That they may encore thine orchestral train.
220,SPRING BALLAD,
221,SPRING BALLAD,"March spreads her boisterous clouds like Autumn’s silvery shrouds,"
222,SPRING BALLAD,"And whistles her winds through thy soft, balmy hair,--"
223,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
224,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
225,SPRING BALLAD,Then soon thy soft April showers make way for May’s bowers
226,SPRING BALLAD,And nature but waits for June time so fair.
227,SPRING BALLAD,
228,SPRING BALLAD,"Spring, Spring, O gentle Spring, thou art dearest of all to me,"
229,SPRING BALLAD,"A subject of thine, I kneel at thy shrine,--"
230,SPRING BALLAD,"Goddess of mirth,"
231,SPRING BALLAD,"Gay queen of the earth,"
232,SPRING BALLAD,"I shall wait for thy smile, as I watch the long while"

241,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,Ho! ho! I come in fury as the storm
242,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,And seek earth’s nations east and west.
243,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,"I breathe the breath of fire within them all,"

245,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,
246,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,"I swoop down on their gilded palaces,"

265,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,
266,THE SPIRIT OF WAR,"I sweep o’er peaceful cities great and strong,"

1204,HIS LEGACY,"He built a tomb for his dear uncle then,"
1205,HIS LEGACY,"And epitaphed him “grand old man,”"
1206,HIS LEGACY,Though in his life he had ne’er thought of him
1207,HIS LEGACY,And liked him better dead than--
1208,HIS LEGACY,
1209,HIS LEGACY,"Alive. So then he called his friends around,--"
1210,HIS LEGACY,Patrons of wine and song and ease;
1211,HIS LEGACY,"Mild drinks did make him thirst for stronger gins,"
1212,HIS LEGACY,And small jags grew protracted sprees.
1213,HIS LEGACY,
1214,HIS LEGACY,He squandered thousands on the race course;
1215,HIS LEGACY,In dice he lost at every throw;
1216,HIS LEGACY,He scattered change like oatmeal fed to chickens;
1217,HIS LEGACY,His pile soon melted down like snow--
1218,HIS LEGACY,
1219,HIS LEGACY,In July. His banker sent a gentle invitation
1220,HIS LEGACY,To straighten his o’erdrawn account.
1221,HIS LEGACY,He did. He sent a bullet in his brain
1222,HIS LEGACY,And never stopped to ask the amount.
1223,HIS LEGACY,
1224,HIS LEGACY,The lavish legacy of Frank Legree
1225,HIS LEGACY,No doubt is sorrowing him yet;
1226,HIS LEGACY,"Lieu of an earthly million francs in gold,"
1227,HIS LEGACY,He’s serving time for soul lost debt.

1278,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,
1279,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,"I clenched my fist, and silent passed him by"
1280,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,With words--perhaps revenge or spite;

1283,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,
1284,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,"With such thought buried in mine aching breast,"

1287,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,Until no greater could I ask.
1288,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,
1289,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,"But what of him? In some far distant place,"
1290,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,Again as oft we chanced to meet.
1291,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,"His wealth had flown, while mine tenfold had grown,--"
1292,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,Foul luck had made him indiscreet.
1293,THE NABOB’S PRIDE,
