52,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,
53,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,Dear Friend:--To whom else than to you can I
54,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,dedicate this little wreath of poems? Weeds
55,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,"or flowers, without you, they would not have"
56,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,"been. Your interest, your sympathy, your"
57,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,appreciation were the sunshine and rain that
58,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,brought them forth--to blossom for a moment
59,TO LEONARD D. ABBOTT.,or forever.

64,ADOLF WOLFF.,NOTE.--All the poems in this volume were written in the year 1912-13.
65,ADOLF WOLFF.,"When asked in what sequence he would arrange his poems, Wolff threw the"
66,ADOLF WOLFF.,"manuscripts in the air, saying, ""Let Fate decide."" They now appear in"
67,ADOLF WOLFF.,the order in which they were picked up from the floor. This is true of
68,ADOLF WOLFF.,all except the proem and those comprising the group under the heading
69,ADOLF WOLFF.,"""To One Who Could Not Love,"" which appear towards the end of the volume."

77,THE PROEM,"I sing and sigh and also curse,"
78,THE PROEM,Thus only can I give expression
79,THE PROEM,To that which will not brook repression;
80,THE PROEM,"I am alive, I have a voice,"
81,THE PROEM,And so I sing and sigh and curse--
82,THE PROEM,All life doth sing and sigh and curse.
83,THE PROEM,
84,THE PROEM,"The joy of love is in my song,"
85,THE PROEM,I sigh for pleasures yet untasted--
86,THE PROEM,For things I dream--o'er moments wasted
87,THE PROEM,And sometimes interrupt my song
88,THE PROEM,With clenched fist to curse a wrong--
89,THE PROEM,It is a joy to curse a wrong.
90,THE PROEM,
91,THE PROEM,And so I sing and sigh and curse--
92,THE PROEM,All life doth sing and sigh and curse.

100,CAPTIVES,"I visited the Zoo one dreary day,"
101,CAPTIVES,"And in the lion's house I watched a lion,"
102,CAPTIVES,"A great Numidian lion in his cage,"
103,CAPTIVES,"With eyes three-quarters closed, with haughty gait,"
104,CAPTIVES,Pace up and down the limits of his cage.
105,CAPTIVES,
106,CAPTIVES,"Was he oblivious of the tyrant bars,"
107,CAPTIVES,"The gaze of human eyes, his captive state,"
108,CAPTIVES,And did he blink but better thus to see
109,CAPTIVES,The jungle's vast expanse?
110,CAPTIVES,
111,CAPTIVES,"He suddenly stood still; and, face to face,"
112,CAPTIVES,"We stood and stared into each other's eyes,"
113,CAPTIVES,And we each saw in one another's eyes
114,CAPTIVES,A royal captive in a wretched cage.

121,IF I WERE GOD,
122,IF I WERE GOD,If I were God--the first thing I would do
123,IF I WERE GOD,Would be to make all women beautiful.--
124,IF I WERE GOD,All women beautiful--and all men strong.
125,IF I WERE GOD,Then I'd resign--and make myself a man.
126,IF I WERE GOD,That's just what I would do--if I were God.

133,OPTIMISM,
134,OPTIMISM,"On that cold table, where shameless, without blushing"
135,OPTIMISM,"They spread their nakedness,"
136,OPTIMISM,I see what yesterday had been a living beauty
137,OPTIMISM,And is to-day a corpse--
138,OPTIMISM,"A flimsy mass of tissues and of juices,"
139,OPTIMISM,"The prey of autopsy to-day,"
140,OPTIMISM,To-morrow prey of worms and dissolution.
141,OPTIMISM,"And whilst the perfume of this lifeless flower,"
142,OPTIMISM,"Concoction made of chemicals and death,"
143,OPTIMISM,"Inflicts an outrage on my sense of odor,"
144,OPTIMISM,Does disenchantment fill me with disgust?
145,OPTIMISM,Does Death's black wing engulf me in its shadow?
146,OPTIMISM,And being face to face with life's fragility
147,OPTIMISM,Am I made sick of life?
148,OPTIMISM,I am not sick of life.
149,OPTIMISM,"I prize life more knowing how brief it is,"
150,OPTIMISM,"How insecure, how fragile and how fleeting."
151,OPTIMISM,"I love the eyes bright with the spark of life,"
152,OPTIMISM,I love them more knowing they'll soon be dimmed.
153,OPTIMISM,"I love the lips aglow with warmth of life,"
154,OPTIMISM,I love them more because they'll soon be cold.
155,OPTIMISM,"I love all flesh that palpitates with life,"
156,OPTIMISM,I love it more knowing it soon shall be
157,OPTIMISM,"An inert, flimsy mass of fetid tissue."
158,OPTIMISM,"I love the voice that rings with sounds of life,"
159,OPTIMISM,I love it more knowing 'twill soon be silent.
160,OPTIMISM,"I love the mind pregnant with living thought,"
161,OPTIMISM,I love it more knowing that soon 'twill be
162,OPTIMISM,The tomb of thought.
163,OPTIMISM,"I therefore let the dead bury their dead,"
164,OPTIMISM,And like a buzzing bee in quest of flowers
165,OPTIMISM,I seek the flowers of life that gladly yield
166,OPTIMISM,The sap that love distills to joy--that joy
167,OPTIMISM,That is much sweeter than the sweetest honey.

176,THE CLOUD,"Enveloping me in its gloomy shadow,"
177,THE CLOUD,"That dims the native sunshine of my heart,"
178,THE CLOUD,"That dulls the keen perception of the mind,"
179,THE CLOUD,"That stunts the latent powers of the soul,"
180,THE CLOUD,"That smothers all the rising flames of hope,"
181,THE CLOUD,That cowes the wings of genius that would soar.
182,THE CLOUD,
183,THE CLOUD,"I am forever followed by this cloud,"
184,THE CLOUD,"I can't escape, I cannot flee this cloud,"
185,THE CLOUD,"This muddy, gloomy, hell-begotten cloud--"

213,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"No dungeon walls, no prison bars say halt,"
214,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,When roving fancies seize upon my feet.
215,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,
216,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,But am I free? Can I be truly free
217,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"When that which lives within me is repressed,"
218,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,When my true self in vain from deep within
219,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,Doth clamor for the right of self-expression?
220,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,
221,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,What hideous mockery of freedom this!
222,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"Put me in jail, put me in jail for life,"

225,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,

227,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"From overhead and give me clay,"
228,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"Oh, give me lots of clay--the tender flesh,"
229,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"The oily, tender flesh of mother earth,"
230,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,
231,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"Responsive as a mistress to the touch,"
232,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"And I will have a feast no king e'er knew,"
233,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,And taste of pleasures that the gods would envy.
234,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"And I will make unto myself a world,"
235,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,
236,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"A world of which myself would be the God,"
237,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,"A world in which my every dream and thought,"
238,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,My every feeling and my every passion
239,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,Would find embodiment in plastic form.
240,THE LIBERTY I LOATHE,

928,A SCENARIO,"Sit arguing, discussing and discussing"
929,A SCENARIO,"Psychology, sociology and ethics."
930,A SCENARIO,So different it is behind the bushes.
931,A SCENARIO,"And while some hug and kiss and others argue,"
932,A SCENARIO,A sudden gloom spreads over everything.

1090,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,That Easter Sunday donned for the occasion
1091,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,"And the parade was also capital,"
1092,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,It was indeed a capital parade.
1093,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,
1094,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,"The gorgeous gowns, the stunning Easter hats"
1095,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,Were capital and those hand-made complexions
1096,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,Down to the escorts groomed with perfect style
1097,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,Down to the sermons that the preachers preached
1098,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,In fashionable churches were most capital.
1099,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,
1100,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,Indeed the sight I saw that Easter morn
1101,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,"Along Fifth Avenue was capital,"
1102,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,Upon the sidewalks silently and slow
1103,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,The grand cortège of capital marched on.
1104,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,
1105,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,And whilst I was enjoying this grand sight
1106,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,There rose before my mind another sight:
1107,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,I saw the street between the sidewalks filled
1108,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,In compact mass with wan and worn spectators
1109,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,"Who were in silence viewing the parade,"
1110,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,"It was a mob of children, men and women"
1111,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,Whose pallid faces and whose piteous rags
1112,EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE,"Gave to the spectacle a capital contrast,"

1125,CONTEMPLATION,And all around arose a deaf'ning roar--
1126,CONTEMPLATION,The roaring of machines o'er which were bent
1127,CONTEMPLATION,The toilers toiling at their tiresome task.
1128,CONTEMPLATION,And as I stood and gazed upon this scene

1148,CONFIDENCES,Espying me from far approaches me
1149,CONFIDENCES,And takes me by the hand as tenderly
1150,CONFIDENCES,As would a sister take her little brother.
1151,CONFIDENCES,"She whispers words as sparkling as champagne,"
1152,CONFIDENCES,"As warm as blood, as pure as morning dew,"
1153,CONFIDENCES,And so enchants me that I cannot help
1154,CONFIDENCES,But yield unto the tempting muse of song.
1155,CONFIDENCES,"She takes me from the world's drear, dusty road"
1156,CONFIDENCES,And leads me into that mysterious park
1157,CONFIDENCES,Where lies the limpid lake of inspiration.
1158,CONFIDENCES,The flowers of life and death grow in this park--
1159,CONFIDENCES,"Of love and hate, the flowers of joy and pain,"
1160,CONFIDENCES,"Of smiles and sighs, of laughter and of tears,"
1161,CONFIDENCES,The blooms of hope and those of disillusion.
1162,CONFIDENCES,"All, all these flowers grow in this wondrous park."
1163,CONFIDENCES,"I drink some water from the Muse's palm,"
1164,CONFIDENCES,The water of the lake of inspiration.
1165,CONFIDENCES,And then in silence do I wend my way
1166,CONFIDENCES,"Through rows of silent and mysterious flowers,"
1167,CONFIDENCES,"Inhaling all the odors of the flowers,"
1168,CONFIDENCES,The sweet and bitter odors of the flowers.
1169,CONFIDENCES,"And like the bee, I also make some honey,"
1170,CONFIDENCES,Alas! my honey is not always sweet.
1171,CONFIDENCES,Perhaps because the flowers of life are bitter.
1172,CONFIDENCES,Then I am harshly driven from this Eden
1173,CONFIDENCES,"By the compulsion of a god I hate,"
1174,CONFIDENCES,And I must go to work to win my bread.

1186,IN THE LIBRARY,"Or rather trying to, for I could not"
1187,IN THE LIBRARY,"Detach my gaze from her bewitching visage,"
1188,IN THE LIBRARY,"Nor could my mind in rhythmic furrows flow,"

1190,IN THE LIBRARY,When like the heaving billows that are yielding
1191,IN THE LIBRARY,"To the attracting powers of the moon,"

1193,IN THE LIBRARY,"I thus bethought me: ""Wherefore write I poems,"

1771,ATAVISM,E'er felt the strange attraction of the sewer?

1773,ATAVISM,"To wallow in the mire, to plunge, to sink"
1774,ATAVISM,Into the frightful abyss of perdition?

1794,I,"The pools' mysterious silent water,"
1795,I,"The erring brooklets' whisp'ring water,"

1801,I,"The thundering, the seething, sighing water."

1812,II,"Henceforth my beloved,"
1813,II,"Each precious scrap of love,"
1814,II,"Each feeling, thought or passion,"
1815,II,Is yours alone.

1820,III,
1821,III,"You sometime make me dream of fair Granada,"
1822,III,Of olden days of Moorish reign and glory;
1823,III,At other times you make me feel the gloom
1824,III,"Of Christian Spain, sepulchral and morose."
1825,III,
1826,III,"You are as the Alhambra when you smile,"
1827,III,"Gold-tinted, graceful, radiating joy."
1828,III,"But when you frown or are indifferent,"
1829,III,"Then like to the Escurial you are,"

1835,IV,"I strolled through lonely by-paths in the park,"
1836,IV,"It was the hour, it was the mystic hour,"
1837,IV,"When 'tis no longer day, nor yet is night."
1838,IV,"When o'er all nature hangs a solemn hush,"
1839,IV,And everything is peaceful and serene.
1840,IV,And thus I strolled along and thought of her--
1841,IV,And then I sat upon a rustic bench
1842,IV,"And thought of her,--and only thought of her."
1843,IV,And o'ver all nature hung a solemn hush;
1844,IV,"And I was sad, and it was growing dark."
1845,IV,And as I sat there on the rustic bench
1846,IV,Close by to me I heard two voices speak.
1847,IV,"They spoke Italian. Softly did they speak,"
1848,IV,And there was sadness in their voices too.
1849,IV,One spoke of Beatrice as angel might
1850,IV,Have spoken of the queen of all the heavens;
1851,IV,The other spoke of Laura as a bard
1852,IV,"Would speak of her who might have been the queen,--"
1853,IV,The queen of every kingdom of the earth.
1854,IV,I turned my head and seated by my side
1855,IV,"I saw the sad, illustrious Tuscan bards,"
1856,IV,The requiem of whose unrequited love
1857,IV,Reverberates throughout eternity.
1858,IV,"I did not rise and go, but kept my place."
1859,IV,Is not my love as great as was their love?
1860,IV,"And is not she as beautiful, as cold,"
1861,IV,"As hopelessly indifferent and cold,"
1862,IV,As ever Beatrice and Laura were?
1863,IV,"And so I also spoke about my love,"
1864,IV,Then we were silent sitting side by side.
1865,IV,"Upon that rustic bench in Central Park,"
1866,IV,Along a lonesome by-path in the park.
1867,IV,"It was the hour, it was that mystic hour"
1868,IV,When 'tis no longer day nor yet is night;
1869,IV,"And o'er all nature hangs a solemn hush,"
1870,IV,And everything is peaceful and serene.
1871,IV,Then they both went away so quietly
1872,IV,That I was unaware that they had gone
1873,IV,Until I turned my head and saw them not.

1881,V,
1882,V,"Bright as a diamond in the dark of night,"

1891,VI,Enthrall you with the music of my love?
1892,VI,"Is not love's music magical enough,"
1893,VI,Or is your heart stone deaf?
1894,VI,Even if so!
1895,VI,I will perform a miracle and cause

1904,VII,When you betray the faintest frown;
1905,VII,"And when you mock me for my love,"
1906,VII,"Or chide me for the least caress,"
1907,VII,If you but knew the pain I feel.
1908,VII,
1909,VII,"Aye, even if you loved me not,"
1910,VII,You ne'er would frown at me or mock
1911,VII,"My love for you, or harshly speak,"
1912,VII,Or bid me not to kiss your hand;
1913,VII,"Instead you'd treat me as a child,"
1914,VII,"You'd treat me as a child that's sick,"
1915,VII,And patiently you would submit
1916,VII,To my caress; you would allow
1917,VII,"My feverish hands to stroke your hair,"
1918,VII,"My quivering lips to kiss your brow,"
1919,VII,"My famished eyes to feast on you,"
1920,VII,And my delirious heart to spin:
1921,VII,"To spin a spider's web of love,"
1922,VII,To make your heart its captive fly.
1923,VII,
1924,VII,"Aye, even if you loved me not,"
1925,VII,"If you but knew the pain I feel,"
1926,VII,"Whene'er I think you love me not,"
1927,VII,You'd treat me as a little child;
1928,VII,"You'd tell me love's sweet fairy tale,"
1929,VII,I will believe love's fairy tale.
1930,VII,"Please tell me love's sweet fairy tale,"
