159,PART ONE,_Threnody_
160,PART ONE,
161,PART ONE,
162,PART ONE,Lilacs blossom just as sweet
163,PART ONE,Now my heart is shattered.
164,PART ONE,"If I bowled it down the street,"
165,PART ONE,Who's to say it mattered?
166,PART ONE,If there's one that rode away
167,PART ONE,What would I be missing?
168,PART ONE,"Lips that taste of tears, they say,"
169,PART ONE,Are the best for kissing.
170,PART ONE,
171,PART ONE,Eyes that watch the morning star
172,PART ONE,Seem a little brighter;
173,PART ONE,Arms held out to darkness are
174,PART ONE,Usually whiter.
175,PART ONE,"Shall I bar the strolling guest,"
176,PART ONE,"Bind my brow with willow,"
177,PART ONE,"When, they say, the empty breast"
178,PART ONE,Is the softer pillow?
179,PART ONE,
180,PART ONE,"That a heart falls tinkling down,"
181,PART ONE,Never think it ceases.
182,PART ONE,Every likely lad in town
183,PART ONE,Gathers up the pieces.
184,PART ONE,If there's one gone whistling by
185,PART ONE,Would I let it grieve me?
186,PART ONE,Let him wonder if I lie;
187,PART ONE,Let him half believe me.

192,PART ONE,_The Small Hours_
193,PART ONE,
194,PART ONE,
195,PART ONE,No more my little song comes back;
196,PART ONE,And now of nights I lay
197,PART ONE,"My head on down, to watch the black"
198,PART ONE,And wait the unfailing gray.
199,PART ONE,
200,PART ONE,"Oh, sad are winter nights, and slow;"
201,PART ONE,And sad's a song that's dumb;
202,PART ONE,And sad it is to lie and know
203,PART ONE,Another dawn will come.

208,PART ONE,_The False Friends_
209,PART ONE,
210,PART ONE,
211,PART ONE,"They laid their hands upon my head,"
212,PART ONE,They stroked my cheek and brow;
213,PART ONE,"And time could heal a hurt, they said,"
214,PART ONE,And time could dim a vow.
215,PART ONE,
216,PART ONE,And they were pitiful and mild
217,PART ONE,"Who whispered to me then,"
218,PART ONE,"""The heart that breaks in April, child,"
219,PART ONE,"Will mend in May again."""
220,PART ONE,
221,PART ONE,"Oh, many a mended heart they knew,"
222,PART ONE,"So old they were, and wise."
223,PART ONE,And little did they have to do
224,PART ONE,To come to me with lies!
225,PART ONE,
226,PART ONE,Who flings me silly talk of May
227,PART ONE,Shall meet a bitter soul;
228,PART ONE,For June was nearly spent away
229,PART ONE,Before my heart was whole.

233,PART ONE,
234,PART ONE,_The Trifler_
235,PART ONE,
236,PART ONE,
237,PART ONE,Death's the lover that I'd be taking;
238,PART ONE,Wild and fickle and fierce is he.
239,PART ONE,Small's his care if my heart be breaking--
240,PART ONE,Gay young Death would have none of me.
241,PART ONE,
242,PART ONE,Hear them clack of my haste to greet him!
243,PART ONE,No one other my mouth had kissed.
244,PART ONE,I had dressed me in silk to meet him--
245,PART ONE,False young Death would not hold the tryst.
246,PART ONE,
247,PART ONE,"Slow's the blood that was quick and stormy,"
248,PART ONE,Smooth and cold is the bridal bed;
249,PART ONE,I must wait till he whistles for me--
250,PART ONE,Proud young Death would not turn his head.
251,PART ONE,
252,PART ONE,"I must wait till my breast is wilted,"
253,PART ONE,"I must wait till my back is bowed,"
254,PART ONE,"I must rock in the corner, jilted,--"
255,PART ONE,Death went galloping down the road.
256,PART ONE,
257,PART ONE,Gone's my heart with a trifling rover.
258,PART ONE,Fine he was in the game he played--
259,PART ONE,"Kissed, and promised, and threw me over,"
260,PART ONE,And rode away with a prettier maid.
261,PART ONE,

265,PART ONE,_A Very Short Song_
266,PART ONE,
267,PART ONE,
268,PART ONE,"Once when I was young and true,"
269,PART ONE,Someone left me sad--
270,PART ONE,Broke my brittle heart in two;
271,PART ONE,And that is very bad.
272,PART ONE,
273,PART ONE,"Love is for unlucky folk,"
274,PART ONE,Love is but a curse.
275,PART ONE,Once there was a heart I broke;
276,PART ONE,"And that, I think, is worse."
277,PART ONE,
278,PART ONE,

280,PART ONE,
281,PART ONE,_A Well-Worn Story_
282,PART ONE,
283,PART ONE,
284,PART ONE,"In April, in April,"
285,PART ONE,"My one love came along,"
286,PART ONE,And I ran the slope of my high hill
287,PART ONE,To follow a thread of song.
288,PART ONE,
289,PART ONE,His eyes were hard as porphyry
290,PART ONE,With looking on cruel lands;
291,PART ONE,His voice went slipping over me
292,PART ONE,Like terrible silver hands.
293,PART ONE,
294,PART ONE,Together we trod the secret lane
295,PART ONE,And walked the muttering town.
296,PART ONE,"I wore my heart like a wet, red stain"
297,PART ONE,On the breast of a velvet gown.
298,PART ONE,
299,PART ONE,"In April, in April,"
300,PART ONE,"My love went whistling by,"
301,PART ONE,And I stumbled here to my high hill
302,PART ONE,Along the way of a lie.
303,PART ONE,
304,PART ONE,Now what should I do in this place
305,PART ONE,"But sit and count the chimes,"
306,PART ONE,And splash cold water on my face
307,PART ONE,And spoil a page with rhymes?
308,PART ONE,
309,PART ONE,
310,PART ONE,
311,PART ONE,
312,PART ONE,_Convalescent_
313,PART ONE,
314,PART ONE,
315,PART ONE,"How shall I wail, that wasn't meant for weeping?"
316,PART ONE,"Love has run and left me, oh, what then?"
317,PART ONE,"Dream, then, I must, who never can be sleeping;"
318,PART ONE,"What if I should meet Love, once again?"
319,PART ONE,
320,PART ONE,"What if I met him, walking on the highway?"
321,PART ONE,Let him see how lightly I should care.
322,PART ONE,"He'd travel his way, I would follow my way;"
323,PART ONE,"Hum a little song, and pass him there."
324,PART ONE,
325,PART ONE,"What if at night, beneath a sky of ashes,"
326,PART ONE,"He should seek my doorstep, pale with need?"
327,PART ONE,"There could he lie, and dry would be my lashes;"
328,PART ONE,"Let him stop his noise, and let me read."
329,PART ONE,
330,PART ONE,"Oh, but I'm gay, that's better off without him;"
331,PART ONE,"Would he'd come and see me, laughing here."
332,PART ONE,"Lord! Don't I know I'd have my arms about him,"
333,PART ONE,"Crying to him, ""Oh, come in, my dear!"""

338,PART ONE,_The Dark Girl's Rhyme_
339,PART ONE,
340,PART ONE,
341,PART ONE,Who was there had seen us
342,PART ONE,Wouldn't bid him run?
343,PART ONE,Heavy lay between us
344,PART ONE,All our sires had done.
345,PART ONE,
346,PART ONE,"There he was, a-springing"
347,PART ONE,Of a pious race--
348,PART ONE,Setting hags a-swinging
349,PART ONE,In a market-place;
350,PART ONE,
351,PART ONE,Sowing turnips over
352,PART ONE,Where the poppies lay;
353,PART ONE,"Looking past the clover,"
354,PART ONE,Adding up the hay;
355,PART ONE,
356,PART ONE,"Shouting through the Spring song,"
357,PART ONE,Clumping down the sod;
358,PART ONE,"Toadying, in sing-song,"
359,PART ONE,To a crabbèd god.
360,PART ONE,
361,PART ONE,"There I was, that came of"
362,PART ONE,Folk of mud and flame--
363,PART ONE,I that had my name of
364,PART ONE,Them without a name.
365,PART ONE,
366,PART ONE,Up and down a mountain
367,PART ONE,Streeled my silly stock;
368,PART ONE,"Passing by a fountain,"
369,PART ONE,Wringing at a rock;
370,PART ONE,
371,PART ONE,"Devil-gotten sinners,"
372,PART ONE,Throwing back their heads;
373,PART ONE,"Fiddling for their dinners,"
374,PART ONE,Kissing for their beds.
375,PART ONE,
376,PART ONE,Not a one had seen us
377,PART ONE,Wouldn't help him flee.
378,PART ONE,Angry ran between us
379,PART ONE,Blood of him and me.
380,PART ONE,
381,PART ONE,How shall I be mating
382,PART ONE,Who have looked above--
383,PART ONE,"Living for a hating,"
384,PART ONE,Dying of a love?
385,PART ONE,

388,PART ONE,
389,PART ONE,_Epitaph_
390,PART ONE,
391,PART ONE,
392,PART ONE,"The first time I died, I walked my ways;"
393,PART ONE,I followed the file of limping days.
394,PART ONE,
395,PART ONE,"I held me tall, with my head flung up,"
396,PART ONE,But I dared not look on the new moon's cup.
397,PART ONE,
398,PART ONE,"I dared not look on the sweet young rain,"
399,PART ONE,And between my ribs was a gleaming pain.
400,PART ONE,
401,PART ONE,"The next time I died, they laid me deep."
402,PART ONE,They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep.
403,PART ONE,
404,PART ONE,"They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern,"
405,PART ONE,They weighted me down with a marble urn.
406,PART ONE,
407,PART ONE,"And I lie here warm, and I lie here dry,"
408,PART ONE,"And watch the worms slip by, slip by."

413,PART ONE,_Light of Love_
414,PART ONE,
415,PART ONE,
416,PART ONE,Joy stayed with me a night--
417,PART ONE,Young and free and fair--
418,PART ONE,And in the morning light
419,PART ONE,He left me there.
420,PART ONE,
421,PART ONE,"Then Sorrow came to stay,"
422,PART ONE,And lay upon my breast;
423,PART ONE,"He walked with me in the day,"
424,PART ONE,And knew me best.
425,PART ONE,
426,PART ONE,"I'll never be a bride,"
427,PART ONE,"Nor yet celibate,"
428,PART ONE,So I'm living now with Pride--
429,PART ONE,A cold bedmate.
430,PART ONE,
431,PART ONE,"He must not hear nor see,"
432,PART ONE,Nor could he forgive
433,PART ONE,That Sorrow still visits me
434,PART ONE,Each day I live.
435,PART ONE,
436,PART ONE,
437,PART ONE,
438,PART ONE,
439,PART ONE,_Wail_
440,PART ONE,
441,PART ONE,
442,PART ONE,Love has gone a-rocketing.
443,PART ONE,That is not the worst;
444,PART ONE,"I could do without the thing,"
445,PART ONE,And not be the first.
446,PART ONE,
447,PART ONE,Joy has gone the way it came.
448,PART ONE,That is nothing new;
449,PART ONE,"I could get along the same,--"
450,PART ONE,Many people do.
451,PART ONE,
452,PART ONE,"Dig for me the narrow bed,"
453,PART ONE,Now I am bereft.
454,PART ONE,"All my pretty hates are dead,"
455,PART ONE,And what have I left?

460,PART ONE,_The Satin Dress_
461,PART ONE,
462,PART ONE,
463,PART ONE,"Needle, needle, dip and dart,"
464,PART ONE,"Thrusting up and down,"
465,PART ONE,Where's the man could ease a heart
466,PART ONE,Like a satin gown?
467,PART ONE,
468,PART ONE,See the stitches curve and crawl
469,PART ONE,Round the cunning seams--
470,PART ONE,Patterns thin and sweet and small
471,PART ONE,As a lady's dreams.
472,PART ONE,
473,PART ONE,Wantons go in bright brocades;
474,PART ONE,Brides in organdie;
475,PART ONE,Gingham's for the plighted maid;
476,PART ONE,Satin's for the free!
477,PART ONE,
478,PART ONE,Wool's to line a miser's chest;
479,PART ONE,Crape's to calm the old;
480,PART ONE,Velvet hides an empty breast;
481,PART ONE,Satin's for the bold!
482,PART ONE,
483,PART ONE,Lawn is for a bishop's yoke;
484,PART ONE,Linen's for a nun;
485,PART ONE,Satin is for wiser folk--
486,PART ONE,Would the dress were done!
487,PART ONE,
488,PART ONE,Satin glows in candle-light--
489,PART ONE,Satin's for the proud!
490,PART ONE,"They will say who watch at night,"
491,PART ONE,"""What a fine shroud!"""

496,PART ONE,_Somebody's Song_
497,PART ONE,
498,PART ONE,
499,PART ONE,This is what I vow;
500,PART ONE,He shall have my heart to keep;
501,PART ONE,"Sweetly will we stir and sleep,"
502,PART ONE,"All the years, as now."
503,PART ONE,Swift the measured sands may run;
504,PART ONE,Love like this is never done;
505,PART ONE,He and I are welded one:
506,PART ONE,This is what I vow.
507,PART ONE,
508,PART ONE,This is what I pray:
509,PART ONE,Keep him by me tenderly;
510,PART ONE,"Keep him sweet in pride of me,"
511,PART ONE,Ever and a day;
512,PART ONE,Keep me from the old distress;
513,PART ONE,"Let me, for our happiness,"
514,PART ONE,Be the one to love the less:
515,PART ONE,This is what I pray.
516,PART ONE,
517,PART ONE,This is what I know:
518,PART ONE,Lovers' oaths are thin as rain;
519,PART ONE,Love's a harbinger of pain--
520,PART ONE,Would it were not so!
521,PART ONE,"Ever is my heart a-thirst,"
522,PART ONE,Ever is my love accurst;
523,PART ONE,He is neither last nor first--
524,PART ONE,This is what I know.

527,PART ONE,

529,PART ONE,_Anecdote_
530,PART ONE,
531,PART ONE,
532,PART ONE,So silent I when Love was by
533,PART ONE,"He yawned, and turned away;"
534,PART ONE,"But Sorrow clings to my apron-strings,"
535,PART ONE,I have so much to say.
