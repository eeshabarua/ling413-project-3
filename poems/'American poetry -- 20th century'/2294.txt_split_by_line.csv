174,YELLOW CLOVER,
175,YELLOW CLOVER,
176,YELLOW CLOVER,"Must I, who walk alone,"
177,YELLOW CLOVER,"come on it still,"
178,YELLOW CLOVER,This Puck of plants
179,YELLOW CLOVER,"The wise would do away with,"
180,YELLOW CLOVER,The sunshine slants
181,YELLOW CLOVER,"To play with,"
182,YELLOW CLOVER,"Our wee, gold-dusty flower, the yellow clover,"
183,YELLOW CLOVER,Which once in Parting for a time
184,YELLOW CLOVER,"That then seemed long,"
185,YELLOW CLOVER,"Ere time for you was over,"
186,YELLOW CLOVER,We sealed our own?
187,YELLOW CLOVER,"Do you remember yet,"
188,YELLOW CLOVER,"O Soul beyond the stars,"
189,YELLOW CLOVER,Beyond the uttermost dim bars
190,YELLOW CLOVER,"Of space,"
191,YELLOW CLOVER,"Dear Soul, who found earth sweet,"
192,YELLOW CLOVER,"Remember by love’s grace,"
193,YELLOW CLOVER,"In dreamy hushes of the heavenly song,"
194,YELLOW CLOVER,"How suddenly we halted in our climb,"
195,YELLOW CLOVER,"Lingering, reluctant, up that farthest hill,"
196,YELLOW CLOVER,"Stooped for the blossoms closest to our feet,"
197,YELLOW CLOVER,And gave them as a token
198,YELLOW CLOVER,"Each to Each,"
199,YELLOW CLOVER,"In lieu of speech,"
200,YELLOW CLOVER,"In lieu of words too grievous to be spoken,"
201,YELLOW CLOVER,"Those little, gypsy, wondering blossoms wet"
202,YELLOW CLOVER,With a strange dew of tears?
203,YELLOW CLOVER,
204,YELLOW CLOVER,"So it began,"
205,YELLOW CLOVER,"This vagabond, unvalued yellow clover,"
206,YELLOW CLOVER,To be our tenderest language. All the years
207,YELLOW CLOVER,"It lent a new zest to the summer hours,"
208,YELLOW CLOVER,As each of us went scheming to surprise
209,YELLOW CLOVER,"The other with our homely, laureate flowers."
210,YELLOW CLOVER,Sonnets and odes
211,YELLOW CLOVER,Fringing our daily roads.
212,YELLOW CLOVER,Can amaranth and asphodel
213,YELLOW CLOVER,Bring merrier laughter to your eyes?
214,YELLOW CLOVER,"Oh, if the Blest, in their serene abodes,"
215,YELLOW CLOVER,"Keep any wistful consciousness of earth,"
216,YELLOW CLOVER,"Not grandeurs, but the childish ways of love,"
217,YELLOW CLOVER,"Simplicities of mirth,"
218,YELLOW CLOVER,Must follow them above
219,YELLOW CLOVER,With touches of vague homesickness that pass
220,YELLOW CLOVER,Like shadows of swift birds across the grass.
221,YELLOW CLOVER,"Beneath some foreign arch of sky,"
222,YELLOW CLOVER,How many a time the rover
223,YELLOW CLOVER,"You or I,"
224,YELLOW CLOVER,"For life oft sundered look from look,"
225,YELLOW CLOVER,"And voice from voice, the transient dearth"
226,YELLOW CLOVER,Schooling my soul to brook
227,YELLOW CLOVER,"This distance that no messages may span,"
228,YELLOW CLOVER,Would chance
229,YELLOW CLOVER,"Upon our wilding by a lonely well,"
230,YELLOW CLOVER,"Or drowsy watermill,"
231,YELLOW CLOVER,"Or swaying to the chime of convent bell,"
232,YELLOW CLOVER,Or where the nightingales of old romance
233,YELLOW CLOVER,With tragical contraltos fill
234,YELLOW CLOVER,Dim solitudes of infinite desire;
235,YELLOW CLOVER,And once I joyed to meet
236,YELLOW CLOVER,Our peasant gadabout
237,YELLOW CLOVER,"A trespasser on trim, seigniorial seat,"
238,YELLOW CLOVER,Twinkling a saucy eye
239,YELLOW CLOVER,As potentates paced by.
240,YELLOW CLOVER,
241,YELLOW CLOVER,"Our golden cord! our soft, pursuing flame"
242,YELLOW CLOVER,From friendship’s altar fire!
243,YELLOW CLOVER,How proudly we would pluck and tame
244,YELLOW CLOVER,"The dimpling clusters, mutinously gay!"
245,YELLOW CLOVER,How swiftly they were sent
246,YELLOW CLOVER,"Far, far away"
247,YELLOW CLOVER,"On journeys wide,"
248,YELLOW CLOVER,"By sea and continent,"
249,YELLOW CLOVER,"Green miles and blue leagues over,"
250,YELLOW CLOVER,"From each of us to each,"
251,YELLOW CLOVER,"That so our hearts might reach,"
252,YELLOW CLOVER,"And touch within the yellow clover,"
253,YELLOW CLOVER,Love’s letter to be glad about
254,YELLOW CLOVER,Like sunshine when it came!
255,YELLOW CLOVER,
256,YELLOW CLOVER,My sorrow asks no healing; it is love;
257,YELLOW CLOVER,Let love then make me brave
258,YELLOW CLOVER,To bear the keen hurts of
259,YELLOW CLOVER,"This careless summertide,"
260,YELLOW CLOVER,"Ay, of our own poor flower,"
261,YELLOW CLOVER,"Changed with our fatal hour,"
262,YELLOW CLOVER,For all its sunshine vanished when you died;
263,YELLOW CLOVER,Only white clover blossoms on your grave.

271,THE RETURNING,
272,THE RETURNING,
273,THE RETURNING,"We long for her, we yearn for her—"
274,THE RETURNING,"Yes, ardently we yearn"
275,THE RETURNING,For her return.
276,THE RETURNING,Recalling those beloved days
277,THE RETURNING,(Days intimate with ways
278,THE RETURNING,Of friends so near to us
279,THE RETURNING,"And life so dear to us),"
280,THE RETURNING,We yearn unspeakably for her return.
281,THE RETURNING,
282,THE RETURNING,And come she must… Yet while we trust
283,THE RETURNING,We soon may see the passing of this agony
284,THE RETURNING,Which makes intrusive years still seem
285,THE RETURNING,"A fearsome dream,"
286,THE RETURNING,We know that when she comes
287,THE RETURNING,She really comes not back again.
288,THE RETURNING,
289,THE RETURNING,She’ll come in other guise
290,THE RETURNING,And under fairer skies—
291,THE RETURNING,And yet to bitter pain!
292,THE RETURNING,
293,THE RETURNING,That day she went away
294,THE RETURNING,Our homes with laughing youth were filled.
295,THE RETURNING,Where then was happiness
296,THE RETURNING,"Is now distress,"
297,THE RETURNING,The laughter stilled;
298,THE RETURNING,For when she left
299,THE RETURNING,Youth followed her—
300,THE RETURNING,We stay bereft.
301,THE RETURNING,
302,THE RETURNING,So all our golden joy
303,THE RETURNING,For what she brings
304,THE RETURNING,Must carry gray alloy:
305,THE RETURNING,"The sorrow that she can not lay,"
306,THE RETURNING,The mysery that she can not stay—
307,THE RETURNING,While all the gladsome songs she sings
308,THE RETURNING,Must bear for undertones
309,THE RETURNING,Old sighs and echoed moans.
310,THE RETURNING,
311,THE RETURNING,As they who go away
312,THE RETURNING,In flush of youth
313,THE RETURNING,May come quite worn and gray
314,THE RETURNING,And bringing naught but ruth—
315,THE RETURNING,"So, when the strife shall cease,"
316,THE RETURNING,"And when she comes at last,"
317,THE RETURNING,When all the armies vast
318,THE RETURNING,Shall at her feet
319,THE RETURNING,Kneel down to greet
320,THE RETURNING,"Thrice welcome Peace,"
321,THE RETURNING,This world will be so changed
322,THE RETURNING,"(So many dear ones dead,"
323,THE RETURNING,"So many friends estranged,"
324,THE RETURNING,"So many blessings fled,"
325,THE RETURNING,"So many wonted ways forever barred,"
326,THE RETURNING,So many coming days forever marred)
327,THE RETURNING,That then
328,THE RETURNING,She truly comes not back again—
329,THE RETURNING,"She, the Peace we knew."
330,THE RETURNING,
331,THE RETURNING,Yet how we long for her!
332,THE RETURNING,How ardently we yearn
333,THE RETURNING,For her return!

347,YOUTH,"I love to watch the world from here, for all"

350,YOUTH,"Fronting the sand, a few great yellow dunes,"
351,YOUTH,"A salt marsh stumbling after, rank and green,"
352,YOUTH,"With brackish gullies wandering in between,"
353,YOUTH,All this from the hill.
354,YOUTH,"And more: a clump of dwarfed and twisted cedars,"
355,YOUTH,"Sentinels over the marsh, and bright with the sun"
356,YOUTH,A field of daises wandering in the wind
357,YOUTH,"As though a hidden serpent glided through,"
358,YOUTH,"A broken wall, a new-plowed field, and then"
359,YOUTH,The dusty road and the abodes of men
360,YOUTH,Surrounding the hill.
361,YOUTH,How small the enclosure is wherein there lives
362,YOUTH,"Each phase and passion of life, the distant sail"
363,YOUTH,"Dips in the limpid bosom of the sea,"
364,YOUTH,From that far place to where in state the turf
365,YOUTH,"Raises a throne for me upon the hill,"
366,YOUTH,Each little love and lust of a living thing
367,YOUTH,Can thus be compassed in a rainbow ring
368,YOUTH,And seen from the hill.

375,AGE,Facing the sea?
376,AGE,Why did I plan each terraced lawn to slope
377,AGE,"Down to the deep blue billowy breast of hope,"
378,AGE,"Surging and sweeping,"
379,AGE,"laughing and leaping,"
380,AGE,"Tumbling its garments of foam upon the shore,"
381,AGE,"Rustling the sands that know my step no more,"
382,AGE,"I should have found a valley, deep and still,"
383,AGE,To shelter me.
384,AGE,
385,AGE,"There flows the river, and it seems asleep"
386,AGE,"So far away,"
387,AGE,Yet I remember whip of wave and roar
388,AGE,"Of wind that rose and smote against the oar,"
389,AGE,"Smote and retreated,"
390,AGE,"Proud but defeated,"
391,AGE,"While I rejoiced and rowed into the brine,"
392,AGE,Drawing on wet and heavy-straining line
393,AGE,The great cod quivering from the deep
394,AGE,As counterplay.
395,AGE,
396,AGE,What is the solace of these hills and vales
397,AGE,That rise and fall?
398,AGE,"What is there glorious in the greenwood glen,"
399,AGE,Or twittering thrush or wing of darting wren?
400,AGE,"Give me the gusty,"
401,AGE,Raucous and rusty
402,AGE,"Call of the sea gull in the echoing sky,"
403,AGE,"The wild shriek of the winds that cannot die,"
404,AGE,"Give me the life that follows the bending sails,"
405,AGE,Or none at all!

886,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"They dwelt and did and died here,"
887,THE CROSS-CURRENT,Nor glimpsed a rosier fate.
888,THE CROSS-CURRENT,
889,THE CROSS-CURRENT,My clan endured their kindred;
890,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"But foreigners they loathed,"

898,THE CROSS-CURRENT,
899,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"My folk were godly Churchmen,—"
900,THE CROSS-CURRENT,Or paced in Elders’ weeds;

903,THE CROSS-CURRENT,

910,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"Though others’ wills they chained,—"
911,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"But made the Law and kept it,—"

913,THE CROSS-CURRENT,
914,THE CROSS-CURRENT,Then why am I a rebel
915,THE CROSS-CURRENT,To laws of rule and square?
916,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"Why would I dream and dally,"

925,THE CROSS-CURRENT,Unlucky number this!—
926,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"My grandma loved a Pirate,"

928,THE CROSS-CURRENT,
929,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"A gallant, ruffled rover,"
930,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"With beauty-loving eye,"
931,THE CROSS-CURRENT,He swept Colonial waters
932,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"Of coarser, bloodier fry."
933,THE CROSS-CURRENT,
934,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"He waved his hat to danger,"
935,THE CROSS-CURRENT,At Law he shook his fist.
936,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"Ah, merrily he plundered,"
937,THE CROSS-CURRENT,He sang and fought and kissed!
938,THE CROSS-CURRENT,
939,THE CROSS-CURRENT,"Though none have found his treasure,"

1421,HILL-FANTASY,
1422,HILL-FANTASY,"Oh, the sorry brown eyes! Oh, the soft kind hand-touch,"
1423,HILL-FANTASY,Sudden brush of velvet ears across my wind-cool cheek!
1424,HILL-FANTASY,"“Play-mate, Pipe-mate, thou askest one good boon too much."

1429,HILL-FANTASY,"Ah, but it was good once to sit together in the sun!"

1434,HILL-FANTASY,Reels across the hot west and stumbles dazzled to the sea.

1784,REUBEN ROY,"Little fellow, brown with wind—"
1785,REUBEN ROY,I saw him in the street
1786,REUBEN ROY,"Peering at numbers on the posts,"
1787,REUBEN ROY,But most discreet:
1788,REUBEN ROY,
1789,REUBEN ROY,"For when a woman came outdoors,"
1790,REUBEN ROY,"Or slyly peeped instead,"
1791,REUBEN ROY,"He turned away, took off his hat,"
1792,REUBEN ROY,And scratched his head.
1793,REUBEN ROY,
1794,REUBEN ROY,I watched him from my garden-wall
1795,REUBEN ROY,"Perhaps an hour or more,"
1796,REUBEN ROY,"For something in his attitude,"
1797,REUBEN ROY,"The clothes he wore,"
1798,REUBEN ROY,
1799,REUBEN ROY,Awoke the dimmest memories
1800,REUBEN ROY,Of when I was a boy
1801,REUBEN ROY,And knew the story of a man
1802,REUBEN ROY,Named Reuben Roy.
1803,REUBEN ROY,
1804,REUBEN ROY,It seems that Reuben went to sea
1805,REUBEN ROY,The night his wife decried
1806,REUBEN ROY,The fence he built before their house
1807,REUBEN ROY,And up the side.
1808,REUBEN ROY,
1809,REUBEN ROY,"He wanted it but she did not,"
1810,REUBEN ROY,Because it hid from view
1811,REUBEN ROY,The spot in which her mignonette
1812,REUBEN ROY,And tulips grew.
1813,REUBEN ROY,
1814,REUBEN ROY,"Nobody saw his face again,"
1815,REUBEN ROY,"But each year, unawares,"
1816,REUBEN ROY,He sent a sum for taxes due—
1817,REUBEN ROY,And fence repairs.
1818,REUBEN ROY,
1819,REUBEN ROY,"My curiosity aroused,"
1820,REUBEN ROY,I sauntered forth to see
1821,REUBEN ROY,Whether this individual
1822,REUBEN ROY,Were really he.
1823,REUBEN ROY,
1824,REUBEN ROY,“Who are you looking for?” I asked
1825,REUBEN ROY,"His eyes, like two bright pence,"
1826,REUBEN ROY,Sparkled at mine; and then he said:
1827,REUBEN ROY,“A fence.”
1828,REUBEN ROY,
1829,REUBEN ROY,"“Somebody burned it Hallowe’en,"
1830,REUBEN ROY,When people were in bed;
1831,REUBEN ROY,"Before the judge could prosecute,"
1832,REUBEN ROY,The culprit fled.”
1833,REUBEN ROY,
1834,REUBEN ROY,"Well, Reuben only touched his hat"
1835,REUBEN ROY,"And mumbled, “Thank you, Sir,”"
1836,REUBEN ROY,And asked me whereabouts to find

1926,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"You naughty man, Saint Columbkille!"
1927,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Why did you Finnian’s Psalter take
1928,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,And secretly a copy make?
1929,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,You know ’twas such a naughty thing
1930,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,For one descended from a king
1931,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"To lock himself into a cell,"
1932,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"’Twas far from right,-you knew it well,—"
1933,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"And copy Finnian’s Psalter through,"
1934,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Against his will as well you knew.
1935,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,And then to think a common bird
1936,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"Should feel such shame, that when he heard"
1937,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"The breathing spy outside your door,"
1938,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"And felt your sainthood was no more,"
1939,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"Should through the crack attack the spy,"
1940,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"And in a rage pluck out his eye,"
1941,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,As if that saintly Irish crane
1942,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Would hide from all your Saintship’s stain.
1943,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,I grieve to think that you did add
1944,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Sin unto sin; it is too bad.
1945,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,For Finnian could not you persuade
1946,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"To yield the copy that you made,"
1947,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Until the King in his behalf
1948,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Ruled-“To each cow belongs her calf”:
1949,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,And then you grew so mad you swore
1950,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,On Erin’s face you’d look no more.
1951,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"And crossed the sea the Picts to save,"
1952,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Because you so did misbehave
1953,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"To dear Saint Finnian: faith, ’twas ill"
1954,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"For you to act so, Columbkille!"
1955,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"A saint you were no doubt, no doubt!"
1956,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,What pity ’twas you were found out!
1957,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,We know an angel (snob or fool?)
1958,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"To Kiaran showed a common rule,"
1959,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"An axe, an auger, and a saw,"
1960,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,And told that saint it was the law
1961,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,Of Heaven that Columbkille should be
1962,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"Far, far above such saints as he;"
1963,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"For Columbkille contemned a crown,"
1964,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"While he these homely tools laid down,"
1965,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"To serve the Lord, and that the Lord"
1966,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,To each would give his due reward.
1967,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,I wonder if that angel knew
1968,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,That Christ these tools had laid down too.
1969,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,O Columbkille! O Columbkille!
1970,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"A saint like you must have his will,"
1971,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,But for myself I’d rather be
1972,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,The common sinner that you see
1973,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,"Than make a crane ashamed of me,"
1974,SAINT COLUMBKILLE,And angels talk such idiocy.

2033,FALLEN FENCES,To wind on aimlessly; but now

2048,FALLEN FENCES,"Beyond, some ancient oak trees bent"

2067,FALLEN FENCES,
2068,FALLEN FENCES,"A space I stood and looked at her,"
2069,FALLEN FENCES,So young; ’twas passing strange

2082,FALLEN FENCES,
2083,FALLEN FENCES,I felt her pride of race; her taste
2084,FALLEN FENCES,"In silken rug and chair,"
2085,FALLEN FENCES,And quaintly fashioned furniture
2086,FALLEN FENCES,Of patterns old and rare.
2087,FALLEN FENCES,

2092,FALLEN FENCES,

2104,FALLEN FENCES,"Arose, reluctantly"

3018,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,A castle stands in Yorkshire
3019,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Oh, the hill is fair and green!)"
3020,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,And far beneath it lies a cave
3021,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,No living man has seen.
3022,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3023,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,It is the cave enchanted
3024,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Oh, seek it ere ye die!)"
3025,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,And there King Arthur and his knights
3026,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,In dreamless slumber lie.
3027,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3028,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,One time a peasant found it
3029,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Oh, the years have hurried well!)"
3030,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"It was the day of fate for him,"
3031,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,And this is what befell:
3032,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3033,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,Upon a couch of crystal
3034,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Oh, heart be pure and strong!)"
3035,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"He saw the King, and, close beside,"
3036,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,The armored knights athrong.
3037,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3038,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,And all of them were sleeping
3039,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Praise God, who sendeth rest!)"
3040,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,The sleep that comes when strife is done
3041,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,And ended every quest.

3043,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,Beside the good King Arthur
3044,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,(How high is your desire?)

3046,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,The sword with blade of fire.
3047,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3048,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,Now had the peasant known it
3049,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Oh, if we all could know!)"
3050,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,He should have drawn that wondrous blade
3051,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,Before he turned to go.
3052,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3053,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,If but his hand had touched it
3054,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,(The sword still lieth there!)
3055,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,He would have felt in every vein
3056,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,A lofty purpose thrill.

3064,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,"(Oh, pitiful the cost!)"
3065,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,And then he knew; but lo! the way
3066,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,Into the cave was lost.
3067,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,
3068,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,He searched forever after
3069,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,(All this was long ago!)
3070,THE SWORD OF ARTHUR,But nevermore that crystal cave

3088,THE DIVINE FOREST,"If trunks of trees seem sentinels,"
3089,THE DIVINE FOREST,For what their vigil no man tells.
3090,THE DIVINE FOREST,And if you clasp these guardian trees
3091,THE DIVINE FOREST,Nothing there is to hurt or please;
3092,THE DIVINE FOREST,Only the dead roof of the forest drops
3093,THE DIVINE FOREST,Gently down and never stops
3094,THE DIVINE FOREST,"And roofs you in and roofs you under,"
3095,THE DIVINE FOREST,Mute and away from life’s dim thunder;
3096,THE DIVINE FOREST,And if there come eternal spring
3097,THE DIVINE FOREST,"It is but more disheartening,"
3098,THE DIVINE FOREST,For Autumn takes the Spring and Summer—
3099,THE DIVINE FOREST,Autumn that is the latest comer—
3100,THE DIVINE FOREST,With the Springtime’s misty wonder
3101,THE DIVINE FOREST,"And the Summer’s yield of gold,"
3102,THE DIVINE FOREST,Weighs you down and weighs you under
3103,THE DIVINE FOREST,To where the blackened leaves are mold. . .
3104,THE DIVINE FOREST,The lone gift of the forest is ever new:
3105,THE DIVINE FOREST,Eternity where dwell not you.
3106,THE DIVINE FOREST,"The forest, accepting, heeds you not;"
3107,THE DIVINE FOREST,Accepting all-you are forgot.
3108,THE DIVINE FOREST,"If there be leaves on the forest floor,"
3109,THE DIVINE FOREST,Dead leaves there are and nothing more.
3110,THE DIVINE FOREST,
3111,THE DIVINE FOREST,"Once the forest spoke but now is silent,"
3112,THE DIVINE FOREST,Save in the skyward branches whence no sound
3113,THE DIVINE FOREST,Seems to touch ear of any man below—
3114,THE DIVINE FOREST,Or else no longer the man knows how to hear.
3115,THE DIVINE FOREST,"Such men build roofs to keep the forest out,"
3116,THE DIVINE FOREST,Yet all their roofs are built of the forest’s self;
3117,THE DIVINE FOREST,Only they make the dead tree a shield against the living.
3118,THE DIVINE FOREST,Such lapsing of the forest then they use
3119,THE DIVINE FOREST,And turn it into countless lowly dwellings;
3120,THE DIVINE FOREST,Sometimes they even cut the living down
3121,THE DIVINE FOREST,To leaven the dead roofs they would erect.
3122,THE DIVINE FOREST,Though some of these low roofs are lovely there
3123,THE DIVINE FOREST,"Beneath the guardianship of forest trees,"
3124,THE DIVINE FOREST,"And some yearn upward as with thought of wings,"
3125,THE DIVINE FOREST,Yet the eyes of the dwellers therein are dark
3126,THE DIVINE FOREST,To the upper forest and they
3127,THE DIVINE FOREST,Fearful of the windy freedom of its top.
3128,THE DIVINE FOREST,They have forgotten
3129,THE DIVINE FOREST,That the greatest roof is but a banner
3130,THE DIVINE FOREST,And that it was a tree that made a Cross.

3142,TO W.S.B.,I ran into the sunset light
3143,TO W.S.B.,As hard as I could run:
3144,TO W.S.B.,The treetops bowed in sheer delight
3145,TO W.S.B.,As if they loved the sun:
3146,TO W.S.B.,And all the songs of little birds
3147,TO W.S.B.,Who laughed and cried in silver words
3148,TO W.S.B.,Were joined as they were one.
3149,TO W.S.B.,
3150,TO W.S.B.,And down the streaming golden sky
3151,TO W.S.B.,A lark came circling with a cry
3152,TO W.S.B.,Of wonder-weaving joy:
3153,TO W.S.B.,And all the arch of heaven rang
3154,TO W.S.B.,Where meadowlands of dreaming hang
3155,TO W.S.B.,As when I was a boy.
3156,TO W.S.B.,
3157,TO W.S.B.,And through the ringing solitude
3158,TO W.S.B.,In pulsing lovely amplitude
3159,TO W.S.B.,"A mist hung in a shroud,"
3160,TO W.S.B.,As though the light of loneliness
3161,TO W.S.B.,"Turned pure delight to holiness,"
3162,TO W.S.B.,And bathed it in a cloud.
3163,TO W.S.B.,
3164,TO W.S.B.,I stripped my laughing body bare
3165,TO W.S.B.,And plunged into that holy air
3166,TO W.S.B.,"That washed me like a sea,"
3167,TO W.S.B.,And raced against its silver tide
3168,TO W.S.B.,That stroked my eager glancing side
3169,TO W.S.B.,And made my spirit free.
3170,TO W.S.B.,
3171,TO W.S.B.,Across the limits of the land
3172,TO W.S.B.,The wind and I swept hand and hand
3173,TO W.S.B.,Beyond the golden glow.
3174,TO W.S.B.,We danced across the ocean plain
3175,TO W.S.B.,Like thrushes singing in the rain
3176,TO W.S.B.,A song of long ago.
3177,TO W.S.B.,
3178,TO W.S.B.,And on into the silver night
3179,TO W.S.B.,We strove to win the race with light
3180,TO W.S.B.,"And bring the vision home,"
3181,TO W.S.B.,And bring the wonder home again
3182,TO W.S.B.,Unto the sleeping eyes of men
3183,TO W.S.B.,Across the singing foam.
3184,TO W.S.B.,
3185,TO W.S.B.,And down the river of the world
3186,TO W.S.B.,"Our glowing, limbs in glory swirled"
3187,TO W.S.B.,"As spring within a flower,"
3188,TO W.S.B.,And stars in music of delight
3189,TO W.S.B.,Streamed gayly down our shoulders white
3190,TO W.S.B.,Like petals in a shower.
3191,TO W.S.B.,
3192,TO W.S.B.,And tears of awful wonder ran
3193,TO W.S.B.,Adown my cheeks to hear the clan
3194,TO W.S.B.,Of beauty chaunting white
3195,TO W.S.B.,"The prayer too deep for living word,"
3196,TO W.S.B.,"Or sight of man or winging bird,"
3197,TO W.S.B.,Or music over forest heard
3198,TO W.S.B.,At falling of the night.
3199,TO W.S.B.,
3200,TO W.S.B.,And dropping slowly as the dew
3201,TO W.S.B.,On grasses that the winds renew
3202,TO W.S.B.,"In urge of flooding fire,"
3203,TO W.S.B.,And softly as the hushing boughs
3204,TO W.S.B.,The gentle airs of dawn arouse
3205,TO W.S.B.,To cradle morning’s quire.
3206,TO W.S.B.,
3207,TO W.S.B.,The murmur of the singing leaves
3208,TO W.S.B.,"Around the secret Flame,"
3209,TO W.S.B.,Like mating swallows ’neath the eaves
3210,TO W.S.B.,"In rustling silence came,"
3211,TO W.S.B.,And flowing through the silent air
3212,TO W.S.B.,Creation fluttered in a prayer
3213,TO W.S.B.,"Descending on a spiral stair,"
3214,TO W.S.B.,And calling me by name.
3215,TO W.S.B.,
3216,TO W.S.B.,It nestled in my dreaming eyes
3217,TO W.S.B.,"Like heaven in a lake,"
3218,TO W.S.B.,And softened hope into surprise
3219,TO W.S.B.,"For very beauty’s sake,"
3220,TO W.S.B.,"And silence blossomed into morn,"
3221,TO W.S.B.,Whose fragrant rosy-breasted dawn
3222,TO W.S.B.,Could scarcely bear to break.
3223,TO W.S.B.,
3224,TO W.S.B.,I sang into the morning light
3225,TO W.S.B.,"As loud as I could sing,"
3226,TO W.S.B.,The treetops bowed in sheer delight
3227,TO W.S.B.,Before the slanting wing.
3228,TO W.S.B.,And all the songs of little birds
3229,TO W.S.B.,Who laughed and cried in silver words
3230,TO W.S.B.,Adored the Risen Spring.

3355,THE PROPHET,
3356,THE PROPHET,
3357,THE PROPHET,All day long he kept the sheep:—
3358,THE PROPHET,"Far and early, from the crowd,"
3359,THE PROPHET,"On the hills from steep to steep,"
3360,THE PROPHET,Where the silence cried aloud;
3361,THE PROPHET,And the shadow of the cloud
3362,THE PROPHET,Wrapt him in a noonday sleep.
3363,THE PROPHET,
3364,THE PROPHET,"Where he dipped the water’s cool,"
3365,THE PROPHET,"Filling boyish hands from thence,"
3366,THE PROPHET,Something breathed across the pool
3367,THE PROPHET,Stir of sweet enlightenments;
3368,THE PROPHET,"And he drank, with thirsty sense,"
3369,THE PROPHET,Till his heart was brimmed and full.
3370,THE PROPHET,
3371,THE PROPHET,"Still, the hovering Voice unshed,"
3372,THE PROPHET,"And the Vision unbeheld,"
3373,THE PROPHET,"And the mute sky overhead,"
3374,THE PROPHET,"And his longing, still withheld!"
3375,THE PROPHET,"—Even when the two tears welled,"
3376,THE PROPHET,"Salt, upon that lonely bread."
3377,THE PROPHET,
3378,THE PROPHET,"Vaguely blessed in the leaves,"
3379,THE PROPHET,"Dim-companioned in the sun,"
3380,THE PROPHET,"Eager mornings, wistful eyes,"
3381,THE PROPHET,Very hunger drew him on;
3382,THE PROPHET,And To-morrow ever shone
3383,THE PROPHET,With the glow the sunset weaves.
3384,THE PROPHET,
3385,THE PROPHET,"Even so, to that young heart,"
3386,THE PROPHET,Words and hands and Men were dear;
3387,THE PROPHET,And the stir of lane and mart
3388,THE PROPHET,After daylong vigil here.
3389,THE PROPHET,"Sunset called, and he drew near,"
3390,THE PROPHET,Still to find his path apart.
3391,THE PROPHET,
3392,THE PROPHET,"When the Bell, with gentle tongue,"
3393,THE PROPHET,"Called the herd-bells home again,"
3394,THE PROPHET,"Through the purple shades he swung,"
3395,THE PROPHET,"Down the mountain, through the glen;"
3396,THE PROPHET,"Towards the sound of fellow-men,—"
3397,THE PROPHET,Even from the light that clung.
3398,THE PROPHET,
3399,THE PROPHET,"Dimly too, as cloud on cloud,"
3400,THE PROPHET,Came that silent flock of his:
3401,THE PROPHET,"Thronging whiteness, in a crowd,"
3402,THE PROPHET,After homing twos and threes;
3403,THE PROPHET,With the longing memories
3404,THE PROPHET,Of all white things dreamed and vowed.
3405,THE PROPHET,
3406,THE PROPHET,"Through the fragrances, alone,"
3407,THE PROPHET,"By the sudden-silent brook,"
3408,THE PROPHET,"From the open world unknown,"
3409,THE PROPHET,To the close of speech and book;
3410,THE PROPHET,There to find the foreign look
3411,THE PROPHET,In the faces of his own.
3412,THE PROPHET,
3413,THE PROPHET,Sharing was beyond his skill;
3414,THE PROPHET,"Shyly yet, he made essay:"
3415,THE PROPHET,"Sought to dip, and share, and fill"
3416,THE PROPHET,"Heart’s-desire, from day to day."
3417,THE PROPHET,"But their eyes, some foreign way,"
3418,THE PROPHET,Looked at him; and he was still.
3419,THE PROPHET,
3420,THE PROPHET,"Last, he reached his arms to sleep,"
3421,THE PROPHET,"Where the Vision waited, dim,"
3422,THE PROPHET,Still beyond some deep-on-deep.
3423,THE PROPHET,"And the darkness folded him,"
3424,THE PROPHET,Eager heart and weary limb.—
3425,THE PROPHET,"All day long, he kept the sheep."

3450,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,Till the lone Woman said:
3451,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,“But we were crazed…
3452,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"We should laugh now together, I and you,"
3453,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,We two.
3454,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"You, for your dreaming it was worth"
3455,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,A star’s while to look on and light the Earth;
3456,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"And I, forever telling to my mind,"

3458,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,To humankind!
3459,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"Yes, I, that ever thought it not amiss"
3460,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"To give the breath to men,"
3461,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,For men to slay again:
3462,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,Lording it over anguish but to give
3463,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,My life that men might live
3464,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,For this.
3465,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"You will be laughing now, remembering"
3466,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"I called you once Dead World, and barren thing,"
3467,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"Yes, so we named you then,"
3468,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"You, far more wise"
3469,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,Than to give life to men.”
3470,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,
3471,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"Over the field, that there"
3472,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,Gave back the skies
3473,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,A shattered upward stare
3474,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"From blank white eyes,—"
3475,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"Striving awhile, through many a bleeding dune"
3476,HARVEST-MOON: 1914,"Of throbbing clay, but dumb and quiet soon,"

3814,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"A strip of land and wind-swept dune,"
3815,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Where nature was quiescent in the glimmering
3816,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Noonday sun of early June,—"
3817,THERE WHERE THE SEA,The Placid sea lay shimmering
3818,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"In a mist of blue,"
3819,THERE WHERE THE SEA,From which the sky now drew
3820,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Its wealth of hue and colour;
3821,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"One heard but the deep breathing of the ocean,"
3822,THERE WHERE THE SEA,As it breathed along the shore in even motion.
3823,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Among the pines and listless of the scene,"
3824,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Atthis and Alcæus lay,"
3825,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Within the heart of each a hunger
3826,THERE WHERE THE SEA,For the unknown gift of life.
3827,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Here from day to day
3828,THERE WHERE THE SEA,They met and dreamed away
3829,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"The soft unfloding days of spring,—"
3830,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Now turning to the summer.
3831,THERE WHERE THE SEA,
3832,THERE WHERE THE SEA,_Alcæus:_
3833,THERE WHERE THE SEA,I am faint with all the fire
3834,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"In my blood,"
3835,THERE WHERE THE SEA,And I would plunge into the quiet blue
3836,THERE WHERE THE SEA,And lose all sense of time and you.
3837,THERE WHERE THE SEA,
3838,THERE WHERE THE SEA,_Atthis:_
3839,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"I, too, would plunge"
3840,THERE WHERE THE SEA,And swim with you!
3841,THERE WHERE THE SEA,
3842,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Doffing her robe, the maid stood in her beauty,"
3843,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Calm and sure and unafraid,"
3844,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"The sinuous splendour of her limbs,"
3845,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"A silent symphony of curving line,"
3846,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Which reached its final note
3847,THERE WHERE THE SEA,In breast and rounded throat.
3848,THERE WHERE THE SEA,He had not known that flesh could be so fair;
3849,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Each movement which she made
3850,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Wove o’er his sense a deeper spell,"
3851,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Her beauty swept him like a flame
3852,THERE WHERE THE SEA,And caught him unaware.
3853,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"She looked into his eyes, then dropping hers"
3854,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Before that burning gaze,"
3855,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Softly turned and crept with sunlit shoulders
3856,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Down among the boulders,"
3857,THERE WHERE THE SEA,To the sea.
3858,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Secure within its covering depth
3859,THERE WHERE THE SEA,She called to him to follow.
3860,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"She led him out along the tide,"
3861,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"With swift unerring stroke,"
3862,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Nor paused till he was at her side.
3863,THERE WHERE THE SEA,With conquering arm
3864,THERE WHERE THE SEA,He seized her and from her brow
3865,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Tossed back the dripping locks, and sought her lips—"
3866,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Her eyes closed,—"
3867,THERE WHERE THE SEA,As all her body yielded to his kiss.
3868,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"Then home he bore her to the shore,"
3869,THERE WHERE THE SEA,Within his heart a song of triumph;
3870,THERE WHERE THE SEA,"In hers, a new-born joy of womanhood."
3871,THERE WHERE THE SEA,So spring for them passed on to summer.
