320,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of city skyscrapers through the tunnelthinned
321,POEMS OF YES AND NO,walls that rail the nervetracked brain with wooden ties

323,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"look you, whose eyes are wise with too much seen"
324,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"through doors and windows, in whom the sunlight"

354,POEMS OF YES AND NO,important one with God to measure love
355,POEMS OF YES AND NO,not by the scrupled ways of acquisition

361,POEMS OF YES AND NO,while I live
362,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
363,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
364,POEMS OF YES AND NO,my love is a hart seeking the waterfall
365,POEMS OF YES AND NO,where he may press two lips against its crystal
366,POEMS OF YES AND NO,depths--see how he leaps to kiss the imaged mist
367,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"that bubbles up beneath him--he staggers, kissed"
368,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
369,POEMS OF YES AND NO,my love is an alpine trail that mountains climb
370,POEMS OF YES AND NO,above clouds and timber to heights out of time
371,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and measure--no distance there or memory
372,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for weak foot and tired brain--but death only
373,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
374,POEMS OF YES AND NO,my love is a trumpet sustaining its call
375,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"to the last clear breath--listen, the interval,"
376,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"out of canyon silences, on the dry wind,"
377,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"the throat of night catches, its echoes are thinned"
378,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
379,POEMS OF YES AND NO,my love is a dream where childhood fell asleep
380,POEMS OF YES AND NO,beckoned by shadows that lengthen as they creep;
381,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"now she sighs, weeps, losing her way--morning wakes"
382,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"the sleeper and she smiles, her eyes are lakes"

391,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that boy and girl were madly bold
392,POEMS OF YES AND NO,not time but timeless changes all
393,POEMS OF YES AND NO,man and woman we should know
394,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
395,POEMS OF YES AND NO,what we dreamed was what we were
396,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and could not timeless be
397,POEMS OF YES AND NO,two strange wild things in universe
398,POEMS OF YES AND NO,too tame for altering
399,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
400,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then let them keep without reserve
401,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the wings they had prepared
402,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and while we walk a humbled earth

412,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"the mind's disease, the search unending"
413,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to a blind conclusion
414,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
415,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I have gone so many ways
416,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"towards praise, away from blame"
417,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to find seclusion
418,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
419,POEMS OF YES AND NO,known coldest doubt and passionate release
420,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the after peace of countless wars grown tired
421,POEMS OF YES AND NO,by their own diffusion
422,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
423,POEMS OF YES AND NO,how many changes seen: chance days
424,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"nights, the grays of violent and tame"
425,POEMS OF YES AND NO,mixed in the time's confusion
426,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
427,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"dreamed plans, wished hopes without cease"
428,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no single piece of life sought
429,POEMS OF YES AND NO,without delusion
430,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
431,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"and yet have loved each coming, going blaze"
432,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"each phase, willed and thrilled to every flame"
433,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that brightened the illusion
434,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
435,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then let me know death as one who foresees
436,POEMS OF YES AND NO,breath's end to seize a new beginning

445,POEMS OF YES AND NO,again the after rain and shine of night
446,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when mellow yellow patternings of light
447,POEMS OF YES AND NO,make rivers run through streets of mirrors bright
448,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to where the air brings thought from its seclude
449,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as though a silver magnet drew a rood
450,POEMS OF YES AND NO,about the mind's internal solitude
451,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
452,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then is the darkness gentle to my sight
453,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with glossy lamps to toss me into flight
454,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and give to sleep the freeness of a kite
455,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that after storm can rise in amplitude
456,POEMS OF YES AND NO,above the clinging wet still unsubdued
457,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to sail in lonely splendor wind pursued

465,POEMS OF YES AND NO,each day has its color
466,POEMS OF YES AND NO,radiates
467,POEMS OF YES AND NO,each day its own color
468,POEMS OF YES AND NO,on the wheel
469,POEMS OF YES AND NO,endlessly
470,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
471,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and they are wrong who say
472,POEMS OF YES AND NO,all colors are gray
473,POEMS OF YES AND NO,they are blind
474,POEMS OF YES AND NO,or else
475,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unimaginatively
476,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
477,POEMS OF YES AND NO,well I remember the primary days
478,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the reds and yellows and blues
479,POEMS OF YES AND NO,those brilliant saturated hues
480,POEMS OF YES AND NO,each its own bright self
481,POEMS OF YES AND NO,intensively
482,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
483,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a day red as a ripe warm plum
484,POEMS OF YES AND NO,on the mouth
485,POEMS OF YES AND NO,staining chin and blouse with summer
486,POEMS OF YES AND NO,while leaves on a red tree flamed
487,POEMS OF YES AND NO,in crimson joy
488,POEMS OF YES AND NO,shamelessly
489,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
490,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and there were other reds
491,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for feathers dipped in blood
492,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to sign youth's honor on a windless sky
493,POEMS OF YES AND NO,running over rooftops
494,POEMS OF YES AND NO,most solemneyed
495,POEMS OF YES AND NO,earnestly
496,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
497,POEMS OF YES AND NO,or red for something velvet deep
498,POEMS OF YES AND NO,over quivering flesh and trembling hair
499,POEMS OF YES AND NO,stabbing the breath
500,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with a wild commotion
501,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like coroncitas on a christmas tree
502,POEMS OF YES AND NO,ecstatically
503,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
504,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a vivid red each time
505,POEMS OF YES AND NO,coloring morning to evening canvas
506,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of that particular day
507,POEMS OF YES AND NO,connecting sleep with sleep
508,POEMS OF YES AND NO,in the intimate dye
509,POEMS OF YES AND NO,imperishably
510,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
511,POEMS OF YES AND NO,yellow was first word for gold
512,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then sun
513,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and it was always rich
514,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like the promise of a wedding ring
515,POEMS OF YES AND NO,or shining birthday coin
516,POEMS OF YES AND NO,inevitably
517,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
518,POEMS OF YES AND NO,yellow was wish
519,POEMS OF YES AND NO,more often than anything seen or heard
520,POEMS OF YES AND NO,except for the canary my father kept
521,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as his own yellow sign
522,POEMS OF YES AND NO,pure and unalloyed
523,POEMS OF YES AND NO,incorruptibly
524,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
525,POEMS OF YES AND NO,mostly it was feeling
526,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the evidence and substance in one
527,POEMS OF YES AND NO,symbol of perfection and as rare
528,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when harsh-cold-rough were there
529,POEMS OF YES AND NO,it wasn't yellow
530,POEMS OF YES AND NO,changelessly
531,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
532,POEMS OF YES AND NO,precious as treasure
533,POEMS OF YES AND NO,awarded by the gods to saint and hero
534,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like the holy grail
535,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the lost chord
536,POEMS OF YES AND NO,those unrecoverable legends
537,POEMS OF YES AND NO,fabulously
538,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
539,POEMS OF YES AND NO,blue was definite
540,POEMS OF YES AND NO,less temperamental than red
541,POEMS OF YES AND NO,more tangible than yellow
542,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like summer sigh or puff of winter air
543,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the outlines of dawn to dusk
544,POEMS OF YES AND NO,distinguishably
545,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
546,POEMS OF YES AND NO,blue was practical and necessary
547,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like the blueing used in my mother's wash
548,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like smoke
549,POEMS OF YES AND NO,water air and sky blue
550,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for everything clear and understandable
551,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unmistakably
552,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
553,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but blue had magic too
554,POEMS OF YES AND NO,meaning giant ships and giant fish
555,POEMS OF YES AND NO,rockets to the moon and planet shores
556,POEMS OF YES AND NO,too big and far away
557,POEMS OF YES AND NO,too terribly true
558,POEMS OF YES AND NO,incredibly
559,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
560,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a glamorous color blue
561,POEMS OF YES AND NO,suiting cinderella's glass slipper
562,POEMS OF YES AND NO,forget me nots and chinese porcelain
563,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and once I found a blue shell
564,POEMS OF YES AND NO,so fragile I let it crumble on the sand
565,POEMS OF YES AND NO,irretrievably
566,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
567,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but even the primary colors
568,POEMS OF YES AND NO,are not all the colors
569,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and each day has its color
570,POEMS OF YES AND NO,each day radiates its own color
571,POEMS OF YES AND NO,on the wheel
572,POEMS OF YES AND NO,endlessly
573,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
574,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and they are wrong who say
575,POEMS OF YES AND NO,all colors are gray
576,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unable to remember
577,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unwilling to separate
578,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with desperate impatience
579,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unimaginatively
580,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
581,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
582,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
583,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
584,POEMS OF YES AND NO,dusk I love
585,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
586,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
587,POEMS OF YES AND NO,dusk I love who know the morning's light
588,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"the night's darkness, the black and white"
589,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of yes and no and all false and true
590,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
591,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I have lived with definite so long
592,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"with wrong and right, with weak and strong"
593,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with how much undefined dusk by you
594,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
595,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for I have seen the between hours
596,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when towers grew soft as flowers
597,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and cold stones were stemmed in warmest hue
598,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
599,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and I have watched a kind gentle grace
600,POEMS OF YES AND NO,take place behind the coarser face
601,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unloose the many masks old and new
602,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
603,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I too felt the purple air's dissent
604,POEMS OF YES AND NO,from meant purpose and clear intent
605,POEMS OF YES AND NO,nothing certain but a changing view
606,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
607,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then let me have time's dusk perspective
608,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to give the life men think they live
609,POEMS OF YES AND NO,an outer shape and an inner clue
610,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
611,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
612,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
613,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
614,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the lovers
615,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
616,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
617,POEMS OF YES AND NO,after the sunlight over barren fields
618,POEMS OF YES AND NO,after the dry wind through stony creeks
619,POEMS OF YES AND NO,we found our little green where lilies were
620,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and knee deep oxen stood watching us
621,POEMS OF YES AND NO,triumphant under trees... for this was peace
622,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as nature meant nature's peace to be
623,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with fertile soil made ready by its need
624,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with instincts tamed in gentler ways than fear
625,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with freedom measured freely as the sky
626,POEMS OF YES AND NO,measures breath... we lay there side by side
627,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"breathing kisses, feeling the wet and cool"
628,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"of bodies grassed in loving, each a groove"
629,POEMS OF YES AND NO,within a groove seeking counterpart
630,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"with close-open-close, with light in dark"
631,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and waves lapping... we heard the overflow
632,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of lake on buttressed dam down sluiced walls
633,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"making music in ditches, singing birth"
634,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"to stalks in the earth, with giant surge"
635,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of up and out bringing humanity
636,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a greater day for love... then happily
637,POEMS OF YES AND NO,we rose and barefoot walked the golden green
638,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to where horses and men waded beneath
639,POEMS OF YES AND NO,multifoliate rays of setting sun
640,POEMS OF YES AND NO,their work done before the darkness come
641,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to cheat them... together all of us swam
642,POEMS OF YES AND NO,glad for the fresh clean water which ran
643,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"on hands and hoofs, on flesh and hide, like beams"
644,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"bathing between, feeling our oneness sweet"
645,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"reward, for the sun was a broken sword"
646,POEMS OF YES AND NO,pointing the peace towards our tomorrow
647,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
648,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
649,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

651,POEMS OF YES AND NO,whatever else may be
652,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
653,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
654,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as long as you're happy
655,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there were flowers on the street
656,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and sweetmeats at noon
657,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and a high wind in the towers
658,POEMS OF YES AND NO,ceaselessly
659,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
660,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as long as you're happy
661,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there were mornings in the sun
662,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and nights in the moon
663,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and a magic in the warnings
664,POEMS OF YES AND NO,heedlessly
665,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
666,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as long as it was long
667,POEMS OF YES AND NO,heart was head and hands were feet
668,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"heat was heavy, still"
669,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and words were trees with roots of red
670,POEMS OF YES AND NO,urgently
671,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
672,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as long as--happy song
673,POEMS OF YES AND NO,wish was flight and new worlds won
674,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"space was empty, chill"
675,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and lips were birds with feathers light
676,POEMS OF YES AND NO,fervently
677,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
678,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for long is as long as
679,POEMS OF YES AND NO,life is as strong as
680,POEMS OF YES AND NO,ah to be happy and free

688,POEMS OF YES AND NO,here before old leaves go
689,POEMS OF YES AND NO,new leaves come in
690,POEMS OF YES AND NO,here before old loves know
691,POEMS OF YES AND NO,new loves begin
692,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
693,POEMS OF YES AND NO,now when the year's one spring
694,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no season chills
695,POEMS OF YES AND NO,now when the fear's one thing
696,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no reason kills
697,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
698,POEMS OF YES AND NO,this is time after then
699,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there was regret
700,POEMS OF YES AND NO,this time is laughter when
701,POEMS OF YES AND NO,where we forget
702,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

709,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the winds have abated and the rain
710,POEMS OF YES AND NO,now the lonely dark comes again
711,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with blue lines running in the mind
712,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with hands explorative and blind
713,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
714,POEMS OF YES AND NO,(was it the bitter taste of smoke
715,POEMS OF YES AND NO,or pepper berries? lips parted spoke
716,POEMS OF YES AND NO,words out of kisses bringing fears
717,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no nearer to relief than tears)
718,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
719,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"now memory is of lightning, flares"
720,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"in the night, with darkeyed cares"
721,POEMS OF YES AND NO,encircling universes strange
722,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as the skies through which they range
723,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
724,POEMS OF YES AND NO,thunder removes to distant space--
725,POEMS OF YES AND NO,from quiet woods where ancient grace
726,POEMS OF YES AND NO,roots tree in soil and lake is mild
727,POEMS OF YES AND NO,only the stormbird's flight is wild

733,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
734,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
735,POEMS OF YES AND NO,thoughts in my head

744,POEMS OF YES AND NO,till my thoughts are dead
745,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
746,POEMS OF YES AND NO,love in my heart
747,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like rain on dust
748,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

751,POEMS OF YES AND NO,whirs to dusk

763,POEMS OF YES AND NO,worthier than words the meaning kiss
764,POEMS OF YES AND NO,which makes true poetry of lips
765,POEMS OF YES AND NO,which sets a wisdom into rhyme
766,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no pen can simulate by line
767,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
768,POEMS OF YES AND NO,music has cadence but heartbeats sound
769,POEMS OF YES AND NO,what no ear ever tuned beyond
770,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a harmony so fully sensed
771,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that voice is mute with instrument
772,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
773,POEMS OF YES AND NO,imperative to move the dancer's arms
774,POEMS OF YES AND NO,would free the body from those bonds
775,POEMS OF YES AND NO,wherein an inner rhythm leaps
776,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"secret with wonder, flow and cease"
777,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
778,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the eye's canvas such beauty lights
779,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of shade and color and design
780,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that brush must hesitate to set
781,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a lesser skill on palimpsest
782,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
783,POEMS OF YES AND NO,yet kiss is brief and heartbeat slows
784,POEMS OF YES AND NO,while freedom captivates us most
785,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and beauty turns to counterfeit

832,POEMS OF YES AND NO,until our tongues can thrust up through the stalk
833,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and stay the light; meanwhile let silence sleep
834,POEMS OF YES AND NO,between us remembering what we were
835,POEMS OF YES AND NO,before our eyes were covered by the dark
836,POEMS OF YES AND NO,lovers who saw beauty in each other
837,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and from the clay drew forth an hour's spark
838,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
839,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"that hour can not die, though we must lie"
840,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with stiffened arms about an earth which turned
841,POEMS OF YES AND NO,about us once to prove how much of sky
842,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there is in love's embrace; our kisses burned
843,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the millioned lightyeared stars that now must roam
844,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the space of all eternity till dust
845,POEMS OF YES AND NO,can rise on flaming wings to plume the dome
846,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with fires kindled by our mortal lust
847,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
848,POEMS OF YES AND NO,what triumphs we have known within the mesh
849,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"of failure, time can not scrape from our bones;"
850,POEMS OF YES AND NO,out of the pregnant dreams of our grass flesh
851,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a fertile spring will issue from the stones
852,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and flower like our songs in crimson mirth;
853,POEMS OF YES AND NO,each hidden sense that death but borrows here
854,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to bring about its own more perfect birth
855,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with quickened breath will help new life appear

863,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the sunlit trees along the quiet street
864,POEMS OF YES AND NO,enclose the afternoon on either side
865,POEMS OF YES AND NO,their shadows dark and still the dozing heat
866,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and there is no morning or night to hide
867,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
868,POEMS OF YES AND NO,it might be anywhere the now and here
869,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when the heart is simple and forgets the brain
870,POEMS OF YES AND NO,in france on a river or a hill in spain
871,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when life was peaceful and there was no fear
872,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
873,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the reminiscent chord the piano strikes
874,POEMS OF YES AND NO,returns us again to the slow learned ease
875,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of oars on a boat and the long road hikes
876,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the faces and voices like melodies
877,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
878,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then old folks gladdened the spry basque danses
879,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as student groups mingled to learn quaint ways
880,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and families gathered for shore holidays
881,POEMS OF YES AND NO,with poppies in the sun and vins des provences
882,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
883,POEMS OF YES AND NO,in the city of the mind thoughts like these
884,POEMS OF YES AND NO,graze quietly in distant valleys
885,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as though time's gaps lay between a range
886,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of sunlit afternoons that never change

901,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
902,POEMS OF YES AND NO,now wake me from oblivion
903,POEMS OF YES AND NO,bow down and lift me to the sun
904,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like earth to plow
905,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

907,POEMS OF YES AND NO,enough for summer to complete
908,POEMS OF YES AND NO,its ecstasy
909,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
910,POEMS OF YES AND NO,let autumn shake its leaves at me
911,POEMS OF YES AND NO,set laughter whirling from each tree
912,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and I forget
913,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
914,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then should my winter come at last
915,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when darkened shadows overcast
916,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the fields of men
917,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
918,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I'll gladly say goodbye and go
919,POEMS OF YES AND NO,while memories warm me with their glow
920,POEMS OF YES AND NO,across the stile
921,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
922,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for every year my dust shall rise
923,POEMS OF YES AND NO,o'er mud and rust to welcome skies
924,POEMS OF YES AND NO,where swallows soar
925,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
926,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

930,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
931,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
932,POEMS OF YES AND NO,tell them who scorn my ways
933,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I lived without their praise
934,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and will until I die
935,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
936,POEMS OF YES AND NO,let them be cynical
937,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I have my own faith still
938,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to question and deny
939,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
940,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the proud and stiff of neck
941,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the small who grub and peck
942,POEMS OF YES AND NO,both look too low or high
943,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
944,POEMS OF YES AND NO,while I but seek to know
945,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the feel of things that grow
946,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and by my living why
947,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
948,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

966,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
967,POEMS OF YES AND NO,step softly
968,POEMS OF YES AND NO,your feet are on my heart
969,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the sawdust underneath
970,POEMS OF YES AND NO,hurts less than I
971,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"even sawdust, dry"
972,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and dirtied by our not particular feet
973,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
974,POEMS OF YES AND NO,it's something deep inside
975,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that aches
976,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I know not why
977,POEMS OF YES AND NO,unless the pride
978,POEMS OF YES AND NO,mistakes
979,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
980,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for the heart that only guesses
981,POEMS OF YES AND NO,still will bear
982,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the feet that walk upon it
983,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but not the heart that knows
984,POEMS OF YES AND NO,too often it confesses
985,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and breaks
986,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
987,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
988,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
989,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
990,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I would remember
991,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
992,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
993,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I have walked from river's end to end
994,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a slow companion to the light seagulls
995,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that circle overhead
996,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
997,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and I have stood still above the bend
998,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that separates the foot from distant hulls
999,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to fill my eye with flying sails wings spread
1000,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1001,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I have watched them many times from where
1002,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the far shore curves around the sun
1003,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and holds it there ensnared
1004,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1005,POEMS OF YES AND NO,while they advanced then dropped midair
1006,POEMS OF YES AND NO,instinct with seaward gravitation
1007,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and hungry claws prepared
1008,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1009,POEMS OF YES AND NO,their wings some shimmering things
1010,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the wind has caught and suddenly flings
1011,POEMS OF YES AND NO,in a rain of gold
1012,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1013,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I am not old
1014,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and yet when night brings me to town
1015,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I forget their wings and drown
1016,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1017,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1018,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1019,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1020,POEMS OF YES AND NO,now and forever
1021,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1022,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1023,POEMS OF YES AND NO,now might I keep you forever thus unchanged
1024,POEMS OF YES AND NO,against the eventual day for both of us arranged
1025,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when the rude winds shall bring
1026,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no promise of another spring
1027,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but cold and comfortless satisfaction
1028,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the grave's discreet and quiet action
1029,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I would not mind the days precisioned
1030,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to the clock's unwinding
1031,POEMS OF YES AND NO,flesh to flesh binding
1032,POEMS OF YES AND NO,would find some way as yet unvisioned
1033,POEMS OF YES AND NO,some way to forget
1034,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the fever and the sweat
1035,POEMS OF YES AND NO,here where lovers have known
1036,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the soft of hair and hard of bone
1037,POEMS OF YES AND NO,hearing each other moan
1038,POEMS OF YES AND NO,a way more conscionably kind
1039,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for a night's repose
1040,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but time defined
1041,POEMS OF YES AND NO,forbids us to dispose
1042,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of even one brief moment that has passed
1043,POEMS OF YES AND NO,or keep the moment thus forever fast
1044,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1045,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1046,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

1048,POEMS OF YES AND NO,catchtraps
1049,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1050,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1051,POEMS OF YES AND NO,we knew the words before we knew their meaning
1052,POEMS OF YES AND NO,who asked so many whys while still in weaning
1053,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1054,POEMS OF YES AND NO,how many pitfalls marked with skull and crossbones
1055,POEMS OF YES AND NO,to outwit those who lay beneath the moss stones
1056,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1057,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then set about to verify the answers
1058,POEMS OF YES AND NO,seeking in us the cause of others' cancers
1059,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1060,POEMS OF YES AND NO,so found ourselves new victims of time's catchtraps
1061,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and now must moan and curse until the latch snaps
1062,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1063,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1064,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1065,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

1068,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1069,POEMS OF YES AND NO,darling don't be lost to me
1070,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the fear was there
1071,POEMS OF YES AND NO,under the sleeve
1072,POEMS OF YES AND NO,lifting the hair
1073,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1074,POEMS OF YES AND NO,darling don't be lost to me
1075,POEMS OF YES AND NO,it was a prayer
1076,POEMS OF YES AND NO,caught like a leaf
1077,POEMS OF YES AND NO,burning in air
1078,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1079,POEMS OF YES AND NO,darling you are tossed from me
1080,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the year is bare
1081,POEMS OF YES AND NO,wonder and grief
1082,POEMS OF YES AND NO,drifting to where
1083,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1084,POEMS OF YES AND NO,darling you are tossed from me
1085,POEMS OF YES AND NO,what here more rare
1086,POEMS OF YES AND NO,thought like a thief
1087,POEMS OF YES AND NO,turning to stare
1088,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

1094,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1095,POEMS OF YES AND NO,so many years of many seasons
1096,POEMS OF YES AND NO,we saw and found together
1097,POEMS OF YES AND NO,snapped grassroots trembling to the spring
1098,POEMS OF YES AND NO,plucked berries out of harvesting
1099,POEMS OF YES AND NO,caught swirling autumn down from trees
1100,POEMS OF YES AND NO,about us drew a sunbright frieze
1101,POEMS OF YES AND NO,oh summer was our weather
1102,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but winter was in our hearts
1103,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1104,POEMS OF YES AND NO,how many years of many reasons
1105,POEMS OF YES AND NO,convinced us not to part
1106,POEMS OF YES AND NO,remembering the search for first green bud
1107,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the rain paths rainbowed in the mud
1108,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the cheep behind the window ledge
1109,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the shutter like a moonshined wedge
1110,POEMS OF YES AND NO,oh summer was our weather
1111,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but winter was in our hearts
1112,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1113,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"too many years, too many years"
1114,POEMS OF YES AND NO,we lived and loved together
1115,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for oh my dear the winter fears
1116,POEMS OF YES AND NO,destroyed the summer weather
1117,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for doubts can frost and worries blight
1118,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"the careful seed, the ripened stacks"
1119,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and questions when they come by night
1120,POEMS OF YES AND NO,leave barren fields behind their tracks

1125,POEMS OF YES AND NO,suddenly
1126,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1127,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1128,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there was sun and moon and stars
1129,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and night and day
1130,POEMS OF YES AND NO,all taken for granted
1131,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1132,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then no sun no moon no stars
1133,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no night no day
1134,POEMS OF YES AND NO,forsaken transplanted
1135,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1136,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there was sight and sound and touch
1137,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and someone there
1138,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as always forever
1139,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1140,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then an empty silence such
1141,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as none aware

1150,POEMS OF YES AND NO,it was a silent evening I remember
1151,POEMS OF YES AND NO,through the river's mist it comes to me
1152,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"a star pierced the air, white with speed"
1153,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"it leaped across the sky, slipped and fell"
1154,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"I heard its cry, it echoed in the sea"
1155,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the swift wild cry of the scornful ember
1156,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1157,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"alone I stood there, never had I need"
1158,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"of fellow rebel more, I a rebel"
1159,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"down the dark beach I ran, I stripped, time"
1160,POEMS OF YES AND NO,was an eyeless reach across immensity
1161,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"and I plunged deeply, they blamed it on the tide"
1162,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"the night, they had not seen infinity"
1163,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like a vast unchanging vista wide
1164,POEMS OF YES AND NO,before me. if you go too far you'll drown
1165,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"they said, ah no, they know the sublime"
1166,POEMS OF YES AND NO,who reach for the falling star and go down

1174,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the day to day commitment to failure
1175,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that judgment daily argues against me
1176,POEMS OF YES AND NO,condemns me to despair... I am guilty
1177,POEMS OF YES AND NO,of more than silence... at times words fail your
1178,POEMS OF YES AND NO,wisest men and then intentionally...
1179,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but my silence like all my secrecies
1180,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"has no defense, none conventionally,"
1181,POEMS OF YES AND NO,my personal idiosyncrasies
1182,POEMS OF YES AND NO,no social crimes... when pride is pain and shame
1183,POEMS OF YES AND NO,an agony too keen for reason I
1184,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"had no other weapon, who is to blame?"
1185,POEMS OF YES AND NO,there was no intent to deceive or lie...
1186,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"my absence is sufficient evidence,"
1187,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"voluntary exile, not providence"

1252,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1253,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the clouds are bleached by lye and ash

1308,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the world I loved was meant for me
1309,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1310,POEMS OF YES AND NO,each day it woke the sun
1311,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and played till time had tired
1312,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then put the night to sleep in bed
1313,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I dreamed the sky was underhead
1314,POEMS OF YES AND NO,

1342,POEMS OF YES AND NO,like a tree
1343,POEMS OF YES AND NO,posed in sunlight
1344,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when the woods are darkly bright
1345,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but they saw only
1346,POEMS OF YES AND NO,black and white
1347,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as I impatiently
1348,POEMS OF YES AND NO,cried fools are you blind
1349,POEMS OF YES AND NO,they looked at me
1350,POEMS OF YES AND NO,their eyes were not unkind
1351,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1352,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when He spoke

1354,POEMS OF YES AND NO,distinctly spoken
1355,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the silence broken
1356,POEMS OF YES AND NO,was what He said
1357,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but they only shook their heads
1358,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as I repeatedly
1359,POEMS OF YES AND NO,cried fools can't you hear
1360,POEMS OF YES AND NO,gently they answered me
1361,POEMS OF YES AND NO,your voice is clear
1362,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1363,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when He wept
1364,POEMS OF YES AND NO,they wiped my tears
1365,POEMS OF YES AND NO,kept me consoled
1366,POEMS OF YES AND NO,for the pain He felt
1367,POEMS OF YES AND NO,fools are you so old
1368,POEMS OF YES AND NO,"you have no fears,"
1369,POEMS OF YES AND NO,have you no heart
1370,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that grief can melt
1371,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I insisted through the years
1372,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but they would not depart
1373,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1374,POEMS OF YES AND NO,when He slipped
1375,POEMS OF YES AND NO,they caught me in their arms
1376,POEMS OF YES AND NO,ripped the garments from my wound
1377,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and staunched the flow
1378,POEMS OF YES AND NO,fools let me go let me go
1379,POEMS OF YES AND NO,I shouted in alarm
1380,POEMS OF YES AND NO,as He swooned
1381,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and still they did not see
1382,POEMS OF YES AND NO,the shadows by the tree
1383,POEMS OF YES AND NO,they never believed me
1384,POEMS OF YES AND NO,
1385,POEMS OF YES AND NO,then He was dying
1386,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and I knew
1387,POEMS OF YES AND NO,dying too
1388,POEMS OF YES AND NO,that they would bury me there
1389,POEMS OF YES AND NO,beside the tree
1390,POEMS OF YES AND NO,where no one else could see
1391,POEMS OF YES AND NO,but the fools were crying
1392,POEMS OF YES AND NO,because I was lying so quietly
1393,POEMS OF YES AND NO,watching the shadows
1394,POEMS OF YES AND NO,and waiting
