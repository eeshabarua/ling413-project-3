124,BABY,
125,BABY,1
126,BABY,
127,BABY,The blue beginning of your eyes
128,BABY,Condenses the sprawling and assured
129,BABY,Blue with which the sky retreats
130,BABY,From those obscene confessions known as days.
131,BABY,
132,BABY,
133,BABY,2
134,BABY,
135,BABY,"Again, your battling mites of blue"
136,BABY,Try to stop the revolving monster of life
137,BABY,And find the indelible persuasiveness
138,BABY,Of single forms within the circling blur.
139,BABY,Sundered bits of a soul
140,BABY,"Astonished at their shrunken estate,"
141,BABY,"They are not sure that they have still survived,"
142,BABY,And plead for the conviction of sight.
143,BABY,
144,BABY,
145,BABY,3
146,BABY,
147,BABY,But when they recollect
148,BABY,The hugely placid manners
149,BABY,"Of their life, before the earthly exile"
150,BABY,Made them small and fastened
151,BABY,"To one pathetic puzzle,"
152,BABY,Their blue reverts to swelling reveries
153,BABY,Whose outward circles spurn the curtained jail.
154,BABY,
155,BABY,
156,BABY,4
157,BABY,
158,BABY,Upon your softly incomplete
159,BABY,"Face, where germs of devils stir in curves"
160,BABY,"That tremble into questioning symmetries,"
161,BABY,A thrust of darkness sometimes interferes
162,BABY,"With secret, virgin places underneath"
163,BABY,Your eyes and where your leaf-thin nostrils pause.
164,BABY,"This darkness bends with helpless messages,"
165,BABY,Like history admonishing a world
166,BABY,"Personified in one, composite face."

171,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE
172,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,
173,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,
174,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"You mutter, with your face"
175,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Pleading for more room because
176,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,It has scanned a panorama:
177,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"You mutter, with every difference"
178,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,On your face an error in size
179,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Mesmerized by the sight of a sky-line:
180,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,“Life is a nightmare and something delicate.”
181,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Lady, they have made a world for you,"
182,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And if you dare to leave it
183,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,They will flagellate you
184,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"With the bones of dead men’s thoughts,"
185,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"And five senses, five termagants"
186,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Snapping at the uneasy mind.
187,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"“No, five riotous flirts,”"
188,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"You say, “and each one has"
189,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,A thick blandishment to master the mind.”
190,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Yes, lady, through the bold disarrangement of words"
191,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Life acquires with great foresight
192,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,An interesting nervousness.
193,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,But O lady with a decadent music
194,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Somehow silent in lines of flesh,"
195,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Finding your face too small,"
196,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Finding the earth too small,"
197,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Have they not informed you
198,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,That crowding life into seven words
199,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Is an insincere and minor epigram?
200,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And have they not reprimanded you
201,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Because you fail to observe
202,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Their vile and fervent spontaneity,"
203,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,These howlers of earthly shrouds?
204,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And have they neglected to drive
205,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The bluster of their knuckles against your face
206,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Because you rush from the leg and arm
207,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Anecdotes of microscopical towns,"
208,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Bandying with a fantasy
209,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Which they call thin and valueless?
210,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"“Life is a nightmare and something delicate,”"
211,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"You repeat, and then, “O yes, they have done these things"
212,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,To me because I take not seriously
213,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The interval between two steps
214,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Made by Death, who has grown a little tired."
215,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,When Death recovers his vigor
216,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The intervals will become
217,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Shorter and shorter until
218,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,No more men are alive.
219,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,But now they have their chance.
220,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"The wild, foul fight of life"
221,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Delights in refreshing phrases--
222,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Swift-pouring tranquillities and ecstasies
223,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Atoning for the groaning stampede
224,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,That desecrates the light
225,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Between each dawn and twilight.
226,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And those who stand apart
227,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Use the edged art of their minds
228,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,To cut the struggling pack of bodies
229,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Into naked, soiled distinctness.”"
230,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Lady, do not let them hear you."
231,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,You are too delicate--
232,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Deliberately, nimbly, remotely, strongly"
233,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Delicate--and you will remind them
234,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Too much of Death, who is also"
235,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The swiftly fantastic compression
236,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Of every adjective and adverb
237,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Marching to nouns that live
238,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Beyond the intentions of men.
239,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Men are not able, lady,"
240,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"To strike his face, and in vengeance"
241,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,They will smear your face
242,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"With the loose, long hatred of their words."
243,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,I will wash your face
244,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"With new metaphors and similes,"
245,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Telling carefully with my hands
246,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"That I love you not for your skin,"
247,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And every bird at twilight
248,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Will be enviously astonished
249,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,At your face now insubstantial
250,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Indeed, you have an irony"
251,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,That ironically doubts
252,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Whether its power is supreme,"
253,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And at such times you accept
254,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The adequate distraction
255,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Of cold and shifting fantasy.
256,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"This is your mood and mine,"
257,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And with it we open the window
258,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,To look upon the night.
259,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"The night, with distinguished coherence,"
260,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Is saying yes to the soul
261,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And mending its velvet integrity
262,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Torn by one forlorn
263,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Animal that bounds
264,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,From towns and villages.
265,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The night is Blake in combat
266,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,With an extraordinary wolf
267,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Whose head can take the mobile
268,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Protection of a smile;
269,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Whose heart contains the ferocious
270,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Lies of ice and fire;
271,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Whose heart with stiff and sinuous
272,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Promises swindles the lips and limbs of men;
273,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Whose heart persuades its confusion
274,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,To welcome the martyred certainties
275,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Of cruelty and kindness;
276,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Whose brain is but a calmness
277,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Where the falsehoods of earth
278,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Can fashion masks of ideas.
279,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Welcome the wolf.
280,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Bring lyrics to fondle his hair.
281,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Summon your troops of words
282,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And exalt his gasping contortions.
283,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Lady, it is my fear"
284,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,That makes me give you these commands.
285,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Men will force upon you
286,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The garland of their spit
287,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"If you fail to glorify,"
288,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Or eagerly disrobe,"
289,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The overbearing motives of their flesh.
290,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And every irony of yours
291,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Will be despised unless
292,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,A hand of specious warmth
293,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Directs the twist of your blades.
294,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"O lady, you are flashing detachment"
295,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Clad in exquisitely careful
296,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Fantasy, and on your face"
297,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Pity and irony unite
298,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,To form the nimble light of contemplations.
299,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Men will dread you as they fear
300,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Death, the Ultimate Preciosity."
301,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Stay with me within this chamber
302,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And tell me that your heart
303,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Is near to a spiral of pain
304,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Curving perfectly
305,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,From the squirming of a world.
306,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"See, you have made me luminous"
307,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"With this news, and my heart,"
308,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Fighting to be original,"
309,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Ends its struggle in yours.
310,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Turning, we trace a crescent"
311,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Of conscious imagination
312,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Upon the darkness of this room.
313,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Night and window still remain.
314,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Night, spiritual acrobat,"
315,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Evades with great undulations
316,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The moans and exultations of men.
317,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,His madly elastic invitation
318,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,To the souls of men
319,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Gathers up the imagination
320,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Of one poet, starving in a room"
321,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Where rats and scandals ravish the light.
322,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,With conscious combinations of words
323,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The poet bounds through space with Night.
324,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Together they observe
325,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"The bleeding, cheated mob"
326,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Of bodies robbed by one quick thrill.
327,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Cold, exact, and fanciful,"
328,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,They drop the new designs of words
329,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Upon a vastly obvious contortion.
330,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Poet and night can see
331,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,No difference between
332,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"The peasant, groveling and marred,"
333,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,And smoother men who cringe more secretly.
334,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Yet they give these men
335,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The imaginary distinctions of words.
336,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Compassionate poet and night.
337,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,You say: “With glaring details
338,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Attended by the voices of men,"
339,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Morning will attack the poet.
340,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Men will brandish adjectives.
341,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Tenuous! Stilted! Artificial!
342,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Dreams of warm permanence
343,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Will grasp the little weapons
344,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Furnished by the servant-mind.
345,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Dreams ... ah, lady, let us leave"
346,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,The more precise and polished dream
347,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Of our sadness, and surpass"
348,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"The scoundrel, beggar, fool, and braggart"
349,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Fused into a loose convulsion
350,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Called by men amusement.
351,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Laughter is the explosive trouble
352,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Of a soul that shakes the flesh.
353,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Misunderstanding the signal
354,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Men fly to an easy delight.

358,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Thus the surface rôles of men
359,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,"Throw themselves upon the stranger,"
360,NIGHTMARE AND SOMETHING DELICATE,Changing his cries with theirs.

374,II,That metaphysical prank
375,II,Known as chance--overwhelming
376,II,Lack of respect for bodies
377,II,And the position of objects--
378,II,Gathers three men and arranges them
379,II,Side by side in a street-car.
380,II,"Freudian, poet, and priest--"
381,II,"Ah, lady, they have not lost"
382,II,The unreal snobbishness
383,II,With which their different minds
384,II,Withdraw from one another.
385,II,Their thought does not desire
386,II,Only to be distinct
387,II,And adventurous.
388,II,They must also maintain
389,II,An extreme aloofness;
390,II,Throw the obliterating adjective;
391,II,Fix a rock and perch upon it.
392,II,"Chance, the irresistible humorist,"
393,II,"Has lured their bodies together,"
394,II,With that purity of intention
395,II,Not appreciated by men.
396,II,With a smile not impersonal
397,II,"But trampling on small disputes,"
398,II,We scan the minds and hearts of these men.
399,II,The Freudian is meditating
400,II,Upon a page within his essay
401,II,Where the narrative sleep of a woman
402,II,Clarifies her limbs and breast.
403,II,He does not know that men
404,II,Within their sleep discover
405,II,Creative lips and eyes stamped out by life;
406,II,That coarse and drooling fish-peddlers
407,II,Change to Dostoyevskies;
408,II,Morbid morgue-attendants
409,II,Snatch the sight of Baudelaire;
410,II,"Snarling, cloudy cut-throats"
411,II,Steal the shape of François Villon.
412,II,Men within their slumber
413,II,"Congratulate the poetry,"
414,II,"Prose, and art that life reviles"
415,II,Within their stifled consciousness.
416,II,Their helpless imaginations
417,II,Throw off the soiled and cramped
418,II,Weight of memorized realities.
419,II,The Freudian in the street-car
420,II,"Ties this freedom to a creed,"
421,II,Narrowing the broad escape
422,II,Until it fits the lunge of limbs.
423,II,"We leave him, rubbing his nose"
424,II,"To catch the upheaval of triumph,"
425,II,And look upon the more removed
426,II,Body of the poet.
427,II,"Lady, poets heal"
428,II,Their slashed and poisoned loneliness
429,II,With words that captivate
430,II,"The bald, surrounding scene:"
431,II,Words that grip the variations
432,II,"Crowded underneath each outward form,"
433,II,Governed by the scrutiny
434,II,"Of mind, and heart, and soul."
435,II,Transcending the rattle of this car
436,II,And every other gibberish
437,II,"Uttered by civilization,"
438,II,The poet plans his story.
439,II,"Life, an old man, cryptic and evanescent,"
440,II,Tries to sell some flowers
441,II,"To Death, who is young and smiles."
442,II,"Lady, this poet is also young--"
443,II,"Tingling, candid somersault of youth--"
444,II,And his words only catch
445,II,Surface novelties of style.
446,II,Different phrases drape one thought.
447,II,“An old man 3 thirds asleep”
448,II,Replaces “an old man completely asleep.”
449,II,"Ah, these endless dressmakers."
450,II,They hang a new or faded gown
451,II,Upon the shapes of life:
452,II,They do not cut beneath the mould
453,II,And clutch the huddled forms that wait
454,II,For resurrection in the inner dungeon ...
455,II,Poet and Freudian leave their seats
456,II,"To gain the sleek encouragement of supper,"
457,II,And only the priest remains.
458,II,From the lumbering torture of years
459,II,"Men have wrenched a double hope,"
460,II,"God and Christ, and sought to calm"
461,II,The strained deceptions of their flesh.
462,II,"Lady, the tarrying soul,"
463,II,"Patient and flexible,"
464,II,"Must often smile at the simple,"
465,II,Crude anticipations of men.
466,II,"This priest smiles and is sleepy,"
467,II,"Thinking of coffee with cognac,"
468,II,"And the warm, assuring duty of prayer."
469,II,The outer smile is ever
470,II,An unconscious obliteration.
471,II,"Ah, lady, logics, masks,"
472,II,And ecstasies forever
473,II,"Spurn the pregnant, black"
474,II,Mystery that lets them spend
475,II,The tense importance of a moment.
476,II,"Only fantasy and irony,"
477,II,"Incongruous brothers,"
478,II,Can lift themselves above
479,II,The harassed interval that Death permits.

1285,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Torban flattered the details
1286,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Of his festival in brown--a beard--
1287,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"With fingers that held a musical length,"
1288,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And spoke of psychology.
1289,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,The clever reproduction
1290,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Of a human being,"
1291,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,His appearance lacked
1292,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,A hairsbreadth of reality
1293,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And barely failed to convince.
1294,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"His eyes, assemblages of planets"
1295,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Miraculously dwarfed, were small"
1296,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,But did not hold the shifting gluttony
1297,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Common to little eyes.
1298,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,His lips were unsubstantial fibres
1299,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And the straight line of his nose
1300,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Gained an unearthly sincerity.
1301,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,His body was muscular but failed to reveal
1302,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,The smug delusion of superiority
1303,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,That lives within physical strength.
1304,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,With a voice in which pity and satire
1305,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Mingled bewilderedly with each other,"
1306,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,He spoke of psychology.
1307,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,“Normal and average men
1308,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,On Mars are charged with being
1309,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Insane and distorted oracles.
1310,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Because they desire to resemble each other
1311,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,We force them to live together
1312,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,On drably elaborate plateaus.
1313,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,There they fashion cities--
1314,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Geometrical madness
1315,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,That censures shreds of dread and unrest
1316,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Within the spaces of its heart.
1317,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"There they retreat to farms,"
1318,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And the disciplined exhaustion
1319,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Of their lives reclines upon
1320,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Monotonous rewards known as harvests.
1321,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,They cling to homes--slumbering alcoves
1322,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Plentifully supplied
1323,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,With complimenting mirrors
1324,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And altars for the mind.
1325,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Sometimes a revolution
1326,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Seduces their living flatness,"
1327,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And an original confusion
1328,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Follows rumours of creation,"
1329,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,But the sanity vanishes
1330,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Into the marching unison
1331,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Of their repentant madness.
1332,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,We who are sane live below the plateaus.
1333,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,‘Home’ to us is a flitting answer:
1334,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Different spots inevitably
1335,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Transformed by our bodies garlanded with mind,"
1336,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Or requests of the heart
1337,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,That tarry a moment for shelter.
1338,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,As we wander we tear
1339,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"And rebuild ancient lanes and houses,"
1340,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Leaving a sentinel of change
1341,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Behind to confront the next traveller.
1342,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,We stroll in twos and threes
1343,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"That endure for a day or an hour,"
1344,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,And we never linger
1345,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,At one place to gloat over details.
1346,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Restless sanity, my friend,"
1347,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Equips the changing cries within us.
1348,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Restless sanity
1349,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Prevents us from complacently
1350,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,"Dozing over miniatures,"
1351,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,With a dream of importance
1352,PSYCHOLOGY FROM MARS,Rocking within the rhythms of our hearts!”

1769,SURPRISE,
1770,SURPRISE,He knew that he was dead because his fingers had forgotten the art of
1771,SURPRISE,touching and were trying to regain their ability. They were no longer
1772,SURPRISE,"able to separate different textures and surfaces, and everything"
1773,SURPRISE,"held to them a preposterous smoothness that suggested an urbane,"
1774,SURPRISE,impenetrable sophistry. With a methodical despair they gripped one
1775,SURPRISE,"object after another, disputing the integrity of their condition, and"
1776,SURPRISE,when at last they capitulated he accepted the verity of his death. So
1777,SURPRISE,far he had not sought to use his eyes or ears--he had existed only as
1778,SURPRISE,a limited intensity of thought and emotion that directed his hands in
1779,SURPRISE,"a fight for variations in feeling. Now he discovered his sight, and in"
1780,SURPRISE,that moment avalanches of metaphors and similes--the detailed disguises
1781,SURPRISE,and comparisons with which two eyes arbitrarily brand a comforting
1782,SURPRISE,distinctness upon a mystery--rushed from his head and arranged
1783,SURPRISE,"themselves to form a world. This was a reversal of life, since in life"
1784,SURPRISE,"the human eye detects and reflects the objects around it, as all good"
1785,SURPRISE,"scientists will testify, and does not first project these objects and"
1786,SURPRISE,"afterwards reflect them. But this man, being dead, found that his eyes"
1787,SURPRISE,had thrown myriads of determinations upon a shapeless mass and changed
1788,SURPRISE,it to an equal number of still and animated forms. The desires within
1789,SURPRISE,"his eyes were continually altering the objects around them, so that a"
1790,SURPRISE,tree became shifting plausibilities of design and a red rose was merely
1791,SURPRISE,"an obedient chameleon. Of course, this could never have happened in"
1792,SURPRISE,"life, since in life different shapes hold a fixed contour, appearance,"
1793,SURPRISE,"and meaning, but this man was fortunate enough to be dead, so his eyes"
1794,SURPRISE,meddled incorrigibly with the shapes and colors which they imagined
1795,SURPRISE,that they had made.
1796,SURPRISE,
1797,SURPRISE,"He sat in a room constructed by himself, and after he had become"
1798,SURPRISE,conscious of the result he saw that it was a hotel-room located in
1799,SURPRISE,"Detroit, Michigan. He examined the furniture, walls, and floor,"
1800,SURPRISE,and they were to him the firmness of his imagination divided into
1801,SURPRISE,forms that sheltered the different needs within him. If he had still
1802,SURPRISE,been alive he would have accepted the reality of shapes made by the
1803,SURPRISE,"majority-imaginations of other men, regardless of whether they pleased"
1804,SURPRISE,"him or not, but death had given him a more audacious vigor and the"
1805,SURPRISE,room in which he was sitting did not resemble to his eyes the same
1806,SURPRISE,chamber in which he had once reclined during his living hours. He
1807,SURPRISE,knew that the power of his desire had returned him to a hotel-room in
1808,SURPRISE,"Detroit, Michigan, and had disarranged everything except its location"
1809,SURPRISE,and exact position. The floor was an incandescent white and suggested
1810,SURPRISE,a proudly prostrate expanse--it did not have the supine appearance
1811,SURPRISE,that pine and oak floors hold to the eyes of life. The furniture had
1812,SURPRISE,lost its guise of being too economically pinned down by curves and
1813,SURPRISE,"angles, and its lines were more relaxed and disordered. The chairs were"
1814,SURPRISE,comfortable without relinquishing an aesthetic sincerity of line--a
1815,SURPRISE,semblance scarcely ever held by chairs that figure in life--and the
1816,SURPRISE,top of the table was not flat but depressed and elevated in different
1817,SURPRISE,"places, since the imagination of this dead man had dared to become more"
1818,SURPRISE,"unobstructed. The bed had an air of counseling as well as supporting,"
1819,SURPRISE,and its posters were high and curved in above the center of a gently
1820,SURPRISE,"sloping bowl that formed the bottom. Also, the walls of the room stood"
1821,SURPRISE,"with a lighter erectness in place of the rooted, martinet aspect that"
1822,SURPRISE,"walls present to living eyes, while the ceiling gave an impression of"
1823,SURPRISE,cloth that could be easily flung aside and had not been spread by a
1824,SURPRISE,passion for flat concealment.
1825,SURPRISE,
1826,SURPRISE,"As the dead man sat in this room which he had revised, his memory"
1827,SURPRISE,"began to distribute pains throughout his brain, and he realized that"
1828,SURPRISE,the room had dominated the last third of his life. The room had been
1829,SURPRISE,"the scene of his final meeting with a woman whom he loved, for a week"
1830,SURPRISE,later she had died after being thrown from a horse. Within this room
1831,SURPRISE,"they had spoken and touched for the last time on earth, and afterwards"
1832,SURPRISE,the room had become to him a square world isolated in a possibly round
1833,SURPRISE,"world--a continent in quality and not in size, where he could disrupt"
1834,SURPRISE,"the imaginative lines fashioned by other men, changing a rose to an"
1835,SURPRISE,intellectual face if he so desired. Every visual detail and remembered
1836,SURPRISE,"word of the woman had merged to a guardian silence, enclosing this"
1837,SURPRISE,separate world with alert sentinels of understanding. He recollected
1838,SURPRISE,"these affirmations with the satisfaction of a transforming creator, for"
1839,SURPRISE,his experiences had become fantasies which his memory strove to make
1840,SURPRISE,"real. This was, however, the result of his death for, as all good men"
1841,SURPRISE,"will tell you, the memory of living beings is entirely different and"
1842,SURPRISE,"often adds inaccurate touches to the reality of experience, making this"
1843,SURPRISE,reality fantastic and untrue.
1844,SURPRISE,
1845,SURPRISE,"His sense of hearing revived almost simultaneously with his memory,"
1846,SURPRISE,for hearing is the foremost aid in a capture of past happenings since
1847,SURPRISE,its productions do not fade from the mind as rapidly as those of other
1848,SURPRISE,senses. He found that his hearing was inextricably a part of thought
1849,SURPRISE,"and signified, indeed, the fragmentary release of thought, and this"
1850,SURPRISE,"alteration drove from him every vestige of disbelief in his death,"
1851,SURPRISE,for he knew that in life hearing is almost always the sense used by
1852,SURPRISE,men to divert the fatigue of their minds (the servant of meaningless
1853,SURPRISE,"ecstasies). Then his sense of smell, changed from an unseen drug to"
1854,SURPRISE,"a floating search, collided with the odor of a woman--an odor that"
1855,SURPRISE,was less smooth and more candid than the natural ones held by women
1856,SURPRISE,"who are alive. Turning his head to the left, for the first time, he"
1857,SURPRISE,saw that the woman whom he loved was seated near him. Her naked body
1858,SURPRISE,still gave the appearance of flesh curved as it had been during her
1859,SURPRISE,"life, but it was no longer a slyly prisoned invitation to his sense of"
1860,SURPRISE,touch. It aroused within him a feeling of thinly langourous intimacy
1861,SURPRISE,and became a visible grave into which his thoughts could sink for
1862,SURPRISE,"future resurrection. It was as though a desire, once coarse and reeking"
1863,SURPRISE,"with a defeated violence, had been transmuted to a longing for less"
1864,SURPRISE,"fleeting and frantic pressures, while one former thrill became more"
1865,SURPRISE,"diffused and deliberately sensitive, finding a possession to which the"
1866,SURPRISE,"sense of touch was incidental, and not inevitable. The hemispheres of"
1867,SURPRISE,"her breasts, imperfect and firm, and the long taperings of her limbs"
1868,SURPRISE,were to him forms which he wanted to envelope carefully with earnest
1869,SURPRISE,"refinements of motion, gaining in this way a less explanatory medium"
1870,SURPRISE,"for his mind, and anything resembling an invasion would have seemed to"
1871,SURPRISE,him an abruptly senseless blunder. He saw that her face was still a
1872,SURPRISE,gathering of boyish bewilderments beneath a mass of hair that had grown
1873,SURPRISE,"more cloudy, but these expressions were hugged by a light that made"
1874,SURPRISE,them unnecessary survivals of experience. He secured the impression
1875,SURPRISE,"that death was amusing itself with the trivialities of her features,"
1876,SURPRISE,while they held a perfect comprehension of the jest without abandoning
1877,SURPRISE,their outward shapes. At this moment he became aware of the nakedness
1878,SURPRISE,of his own body and felt the loss of that snug assurance which his skin
1879,SURPRISE,had once given him. In its place there was a sheath that seemed hardly
1880,SURPRISE,more than a visual flutter.
1881,SURPRISE,
1882,SURPRISE,He looked up at the woman and their smiles were adeptly synchronized.
1883,SURPRISE,Living people are apt to smile when they have hidden too little and
1884,SURPRISE,"weep when there is nothing left to hide, but the smiles of this dead"
1885,SURPRISE,man and woman were informal exercises of candour--thought adopting more
1886,SURPRISE,perceptible and less evasive signals.
1887,SURPRISE,
1888,SURPRISE,"“Have you been sitting here since your death?” he asked. “No, I’ve also"
1889,SURPRISE,"been creating on the streets of Detroit,” she said. “You manage it in"
1890,SURPRISE,this way. First you drive all of the alertness out of your senses and
1891,SURPRISE,"your mind, and everything around you becomes a vibrating, shapeless"
1892,SURPRISE,"substance, a little thicker than mist and hued with a gray that is"
1893,SURPRISE,almost colorless. Then you give a moderate vigor to your senses and
1894,SURPRISE,"your mind, and the substance breaks into hosts of shapes. You have"
1895,SURPRISE,"attained the perceptions of an ordinary, living person and you find"
1896,SURPRISE,that you are walking on a street. During all of this time you have
1897,SURPRISE,"held back the strength of your imagination, which is alone real, but"
1898,SURPRISE,now you release it and it shoots from you and follows the commands of
1899,SURPRISE,your desires. An old man’s whiskers change to a weedy sprouting of
1900,SURPRISE,"thought, and each hair is the dangling of a different idea. You can see"
1901,SURPRISE,the decay of an empire crowding itself into a young girl’s green and
1902,SURPRISE,"mean hat, and different events emerge and group themselves to seize or"
1903,SURPRISE,obliterate the color. A woman’s leg becomes a fat blasphemy and within
1904,SURPRISE,"its shaking famous jelly you can spy a saint, writhing in the effort to"
1905,SURPRISE,"free himself. A young man’s shoulders are two, dead, delicate thoughts"
1906,SURPRISE,"caught in a bulging tomb, with their ghosts speaking through each"
1907,SURPRISE,unconscious movement of his arms. The street-pavement lives and is a
1908,SURPRISE,"hard, detached hatred, sapping the strength of those who have enslaved"
1909,SURPRISE,"it.... Sometimes I’ve returned to this room, not to rest, for weariness"
1910,SURPRISE,"springs only from that thick weakness of imagination known as flesh,"
1911,SURPRISE,but to find you here before the final emphasis of your death.”
1912,SURPRISE,
1913,SURPRISE,“Since I’m not accustomed to being dead I must ask questions whose
1914,SURPRISE,"answers are obvious to you,” he said. “Why are living beings unable to"
1915,SURPRISE,see you? How do you avoid their jostling and the rolling devices that
1916,SURPRISE,"they have made? How can we sit in a hotel-room, which must at the same"
1917,SURPRISE,"time be occupied by living beings, without seeing or hearing them?"
1918,SURPRISE,Treat me as an earthly school-boy for a moment.”
1919,SURPRISE,
1920,SURPRISE,"“Living beings dwell in realms made by their imaginations,” she said."
1921,SURPRISE,“We do not fit into these realms and consequently we are not forms
1922,SURPRISE,that can be detected by the senses and imaginations of people who are
1923,SURPRISE,alive. The desires of these people have created a world of objects and
1924,SURPRISE,"substantiations which does not match our own, and so our world is an"
1925,SURPRISE,independent one placed over the world of living men. With different
1926,SURPRISE,intensities and designs of imagination we invade a shapeless substance
1927,SURPRISE,and give it the elaborate distinctness of our longings. This substance
1928,SURPRISE,"is inert imagination, and when we make our senses and minds blank we"
1929,SURPRISE,"become a part of it. Of course, I use the word imagination because"
1930,SURPRISE,death has not yet taught me a better one. Beyond the earth there are
1931,SURPRISE,stars and space which are not controlled and shaped by our individual
1932,SURPRISE,"imaginations, and when the feet of our imaginations become light enough"
1933,SURPRISE,"to rise beyond the shapeless mass which gave birth to them, we shall"
1934,SURPRISE,discover what greater imaginations in turn gave birth to the feeble
1935,SURPRISE,beginning which formed us. And so we shall be able to discard this
1936,SURPRISE,"word, imagination, which only represents the boundaries of our desire"
1937,SURPRISE,"and its attendant senses and thoughts, and gain the words of greater"
1938,SURPRISE,explanations. But before we depart from these boundaries we must make
1939,SURPRISE,"ourselves entirely clear and untroubled, and it will be necessary for"
1940,SURPRISE,us to reconstruct the last meeting that we had during our lifetimes.
1941,SURPRISE,"This meeting troubles us with an unfulfillment of imagination, and if"
1942,SURPRISE,we do not alter it the strength of our imaginations will be hampered
1943,SURPRISE,by a recollection of former weakness. All men and women who die must
1944,SURPRISE,return to the most swiftly vivid scene that their imaginations were
1945,SURPRISE,able to attain during the period known as life. In this way the scene
1946,SURPRISE,"is gradually made perfect by understanding, and the imagination,"
1947,SURPRISE,"shaking off the terror of past weakness and indecision, is able to"
1948,SURPRISE,float away from the substance that created it. Because our imaginations
1949,SURPRISE,"were much stronger than the ones surrounding them, we can achieve this"
1950,SURPRISE,"task immediately, while other dead people must slowly grapple for this"
1951,SURPRISE,"emancipation, visiting their scene in those guises which living people"
1952,SURPRISE,call ghosts.”
1953,SURPRISE,
1954,SURPRISE,"“You must direct me,” he said. “I was never much in harmony with the"
1955,SURPRISE,"imaginative semblances and rituals of most living people, and now that"
1956,SURPRISE,I am dead I can scarcely remember them.”
1957,SURPRISE,
1958,SURPRISE,"“Make your senses heavy and tight,” she said. “Reduce them to a"
1959,SURPRISE,condition that approaches a stupor--a hopeful stupor such as prevails
1960,SURPRISE,among those living men known as mystics and priests. When you have
1961,SURPRISE,"accomplished this, make little rows of imaginative objects and force"
1962,SURPRISE,"your mind to squeeze itself within them, adoring some and hating"
1963,SURPRISE,others. Then try to arouse your senses by concentrating them upon a
1964,SURPRISE,"thickly plotting form that once was flesh, while still making them"
1965,SURPRISE,retain a disturbing trace of their former coma. You remember this
1966,SURPRISE,form--separated into hairsbreadths of worship and laceration by stunted
1967,SURPRISE,men?”
1968,SURPRISE,
1969,SURPRISE,"“Your description of living imagination is perfect,” he said. “It will"
1970,SURPRISE,"be minutely disagreeable to follow your orders, but let us complete the"
1971,SURPRISE,task quickly.”
1972,SURPRISE,
1973,SURPRISE,"They looked away from each other, immersed in the strain of their"
1974,SURPRISE,inner labours. The room disappeared in large pieces that receded to
1975,SURPRISE,"the background of a gray substance, and consciousness left their"
1976,SURPRISE,bodies. Her body faded out while his solidified to flesh draped by the
1977,SURPRISE,clumsy fears of clothes. Then the gray substance slowly adopted the
1978,SURPRISE,"shapes, colours, and details of a railroad station. Once more he was a"
1979,SURPRISE,"suffering and encumbered poet, standing in the battling race of people"
1980,SURPRISE,"and waiting for the train that would bring her to Detroit, Michigan."
1981,SURPRISE,"He paced up and down the cement platform, erasing his thoughts with"
1982,SURPRISE,the long strokes of his limbs and obsessed only by the belief that he
1983,SURPRISE,"was walking nearer to her in this fashion, since he was weary of being"
1984,SURPRISE,over-awed by distance. Because he did not associate her qualities and
1985,SURPRISE,thoughts with those of other people he could never convince himself
1986,SURPRISE,"that she was real unless she stood beside him and spoke, and when her"
1987,SURPRISE,body was absent she became the unreal confirmation of his desires--a
1988,SURPRISE,dream to which he had given the plausible tricks of flesh and voice.
1989,SURPRISE,"Only the return of these two things could reassure him, for she was to"
1990,SURPRISE,him far too delicately exact and mentally unperturbed to exist actually
1991,SURPRISE,"in the sweating, dense, malaria-saturated revolutions of a world."
1992,SURPRISE,
1993,SURPRISE,The train arrived and he stood near the gate. People streamed out--a
1994,SURPRISE,regiment disbanded after a lonely and forced conflict with thought in
1995,SURPRISE,"uncomfortable seats, or with diluted chatter that fascinated their"
1996,SURPRISE,inner emptiness. They were the people whose vast insistence and
1997,SURPRISE,blundering control of the earth made him doubt the reality of the woman
1998,SURPRISE,"whom he loved. Oh, to feel once more certain that she was human--that"
1999,SURPRISE,her incredibly tenuous aloofness could stoop to the shields of flesh!
2000,SURPRISE,"Yes, she would come now, an alien straggler passively submitting to"
2001,SURPRISE,the momentum of a regiment of people. When she failed to appear he
2002,SURPRISE,"still lingered near the gate, inventing practical reasons for her"
2003,SURPRISE,"absence--the packing of baggage, a delayed toilette. The iron gates"
2004,SURPRISE,shut with a thud that was to him the boot-sound of reality against his
2005,SURPRISE,head.
2006,SURPRISE,
2007,SURPRISE,He bought a newspaper; sat down in the waiting-room; and sought to
2008,SURPRISE,"submerge his distress in the hasty and distorted versions of murders,"
2009,SURPRISE,"robberies, scandals, controversies, and machinations that defiled"
2010,SURPRISE,white sheets of paper. But he could see nothing save a hazy host
2011,SURPRISE,of men fighting against or accepting the complexly sinister fever
2012,SURPRISE,"that made them mutilate each other, and weary of this often-repeated"
2013,SURPRISE,vision he dropped the paper. His mind gathered itself to that tight
2014,SURPRISE,"and aching lunge known as emotion, and morbidly he involved her in"
2015,SURPRISE,"disasters--train-wrecks, suicide, the assault of another person. He"
2016,SURPRISE,began to feel that melodrama was the only overwhelming sincerity in
2017,SURPRISE,"a tangle of crafty or poorly adjusted disguises, and his emotional"
2018,SURPRISE,activity fed eagerly upon this belief. All of the paraphernalia of
2019,SURPRISE,"fatalism rose before his eyes--the small, lit stage with its puppets;"
2020,SURPRISE,the myriads of strings extending into a frame of darkness and pulled
2021,SURPRISE,by invisible hands; the sudden and prearranged descent of catastrophe;
2022,SURPRISE,"the laughter of an audience of gods, examining the spectacle with a"
2023,SURPRISE,mixture of sardonic and bored moments. But abruptly he felt that these
2024,SURPRISE,were merely the devices of a self-pity that sought to raise its stature
2025,SURPRISE,by imagining itself the victim of a sublime conspiracy. He whistled
2026,SURPRISE,"some bars of a popular song, deliberately snatching at an inane relief"
2027,SURPRISE,from the industries of his mind. Then he walked back to the gates and
2028,SURPRISE,"waited for the next train, which was about to arrive. Once more the"
2029,SURPRISE,importantly fatigued stream of people; once more her absence. He had
2030,SURPRISE,turned away from the gate when her hand questioned his shoulder.
2031,SURPRISE,
2032,SURPRISE,"“And so you are real and I have not been deceived,” he said."
2033,SURPRISE,
2034,SURPRISE,"“I am as real as you care to make me,” she answered. “I was hunting for"
2035,SURPRISE,a comb in my valise when the train came in. Combs always elude me.”
2036,SURPRISE,
2037,SURPRISE,"She mentioned the name of a hotel and they walked to it in silence, for"
2038,SURPRISE,speech to them demanded an impregnable privacy that was violated by
2039,SURPRISE,even the swiftly passing eyes and ears of other people. When they were
2040,SURPRISE,alone in the hotel-room he watched her remove outer garments and don a
2041,SURPRISE,"kimono, with a pleasure that coerced sensual longing into an enslaved"
2042,SURPRISE,contemplation--a fire that glowed without burning.
2043,SURPRISE,
2044,SURPRISE,"“When I see your flesh then you are most unreal,” he said. “It becomes"
2045,SURPRISE,a last garment that you have neglected to unfasten because you wish to
2046,SURPRISE,pretend that you belong to the earth. The cupped appeal of your breasts
2047,SURPRISE,is the subtle lie with which something infinitely abstract evades the
2048,SURPRISE,weight of a world. There is a surprised element attached to your legs
2049,SURPRISE,and they never seem assured in their task of supporting your torso. And
2050,SURPRISE,"yet, when your body is beyond my actual sight your reality is still"
2051,SURPRISE,"doubtful, for then I lack even the uncertain evidence of your flesh. I"
2052,SURPRISE,"am helpless--I cannot mingle you with cities and men, and even country"
2053,SURPRISE,roads seem heavily unwilling to hold you.”
2054,SURPRISE,
2055,SURPRISE,"“And is it impossible for you to accept this body as a necessary,"
2056,SURPRISE,"insincere contrast to my thoughts and emotions?” she asked, with"
2057,SURPRISE,"lightness. “You are tensely morbid, Max. Now I shall sit on your knee."
2058,SURPRISE,"The scene is prearranged. You must promptly clutch me, in that involved"
2059,SURPRISE,manner that has made novelists famous and blurred the integrity of
2060,SURPRISE,poets. The earth has anointed and pointed riots waiting for you!”
2061,SURPRISE,
2062,SURPRISE,His fingers studied the short brown curls on her head and his lips
2063,SURPRISE,"touched the less obvious parts of her face--her chin, the tip of her"
2064,SURPRISE,"inwardly curving nose, her temples, the meeting-place of forehead and"
2065,SURPRISE,hair.
2066,SURPRISE,
2067,SURPRISE,"“I can see two men looking at me now,” he said. “To one I am an"
2068,SURPRISE,"emasculated fool who places a dainty overtone upon his weakness, and to"
2069,SURPRISE,the other I am chaining strong desires with the lies of vain and pretty
2070,SURPRISE,"gestures. Olga, the earth is bulky and profane, and dreads anything"
2071,SURPRISE,"that delicately, aloofly disputes its size!”"
2072,SURPRISE,
2073,SURPRISE,She carefully fitted her head between his shoulder and neck.
2074,SURPRISE,
2075,SURPRISE,"“This listening peace that you bring me, and the softer intentions of"
2076,SURPRISE,"your hands, they are more important than the lunges of men,” she said."
2077,SURPRISE,“We are spontaneous in ways whose breathlike intensity has not been
2078,SURPRISE,"corrupted by the screaming of nerves, and Oh, we must prepare ourselves"
2079,SURPRISE,for the indifference and ridicules of a coarser audience. They cannot
2080,SURPRISE,"peer into this room, yet afterwards something within the buoyant"
2081,SURPRISE,removal of our bodies tells them to punish us with poverty and little
2082,SURPRISE,food.”
2083,SURPRISE,
2084,SURPRISE,"He grinned, and crowded flights of defiance were on his face."
2085,SURPRISE,
2086,SURPRISE,"“I’ve been eating onions and bread for the last week,” he said. “I cut"
2087,SURPRISE,"the onions into various shapes, making them resemble different articles"
2088,SURPRISE,of food. With an imaginative seriousness one can almost overcome the
2089,SURPRISE,sense of taste. Almost.”
2090,SURPRISE,
2091,SURPRISE,"“It is only that word that keeps us here,” she said. “We are almost"
2092,SURPRISE,free illusions.”
2093,SURPRISE,
2094,SURPRISE,"She walked to the bureau and brushed her hair, for she did not want him"
2095,SURPRISE,to see an expression on her face. He guessed it and became repentantly
2096,SURPRISE,merry.
2097,SURPRISE,
2098,SURPRISE,"“Sold a poem two weeks ago,” he said. “The editor wrote something"
2099,SURPRISE,about ‘great originality but rather tenuous’ and ‘this is not a
2100,SURPRISE,spiritual age.’ It isn’t.”
2101,SURPRISE,
2102,SURPRISE,"“Let me hear it,” she said."
2103,SURPRISE,
2104,SURPRISE,It concerned a circle of men dumped into chairs in the lobby of a
2105,SURPRISE,"cheap lodging-house--rag-dolls twitching now and then, as though an"
2106,SURPRISE,outside hand were poking them with curiosity. Then the spirit of the
2107,SURPRISE,"lodging-house, sallow and indecently shallow, sidled into the lobby,"
2108,SURPRISE,"correctly aimed its tobacco at a spitoon, and gave the dolls snores"
2109,SURPRISE,"to create a false appearance of life, whereupon one of them rose"
2110,SURPRISE,and cursed the invisible intruder in his sleep. The spirit of the
2111,SURPRISE,"lodging-house, frightened and angry at the appearance of a soul whose"
2112,SURPRISE,"existence it had not imagined, whisked them all off to the torture"
2113,SURPRISE,of their beds. The poem had spoken to Baudelaire and Dostoyevsky
2114,SURPRISE,but within it a stunned hatred of the world was experimenting with
2115,SURPRISE,appropriate symbols.
2116,SURPRISE,
2117,SURPRISE,"“Irrelevantly, perhaps, I’m thinking of a time when I washed dishes in"
2118,SURPRISE,"a lunch-room in St. Louis,” she said. “I was hunting in my mind for"
2119,SURPRISE,something that could deceive the greasy monotone of defiled chinaware.
2120,SURPRISE,"Suddenly the brown and turbid dish-water became a heavy wine, spiced"
2121,SURPRISE,with the aftermaths of earthly pleasures--decay to which a spiritual
2122,SURPRISE,release had given a liquid significance. I became obsessed by the
2123,SURPRISE,"verity of this idea, and finally, quite entranced, I raised the pan"
2124,SURPRISE,"of dirty water to my lips and was about to drink it when, at that"
2125,SURPRISE,"moment, the proprietor came in. He squawked ‘crazee-e,’ ‘crazee-e,’ and"
2126,SURPRISE,"discharged me. I wrote an excellent poem about it, though.”"
2127,SURPRISE,
2128,SURPRISE,"“Let’s see, what would they say about this,” he muttered."
2129,SURPRISE,"“Neurasthenia, insanity, exalted paranoia, minor conceit, trivial pose,"
2130,SURPRISE,"empty fantasy--they have so many putrid labels to hide the inner rage,"
2131,SURPRISE,damn them!”
2132,SURPRISE,
2133,SURPRISE,"They swayed together in the chair, like two babies in a trap, taking"
2134,SURPRISE,the small amount of room possible in the cramped abode.
2135,SURPRISE,
2136,SURPRISE,"“Tomorrow we’ll look for work,” she said. “The breath-tablets that you"
2137,SURPRISE,bought to hide the scent of onions have not been able to eradicate a
2138,SURPRISE,last melodramatic trace of their enemy. We must move our arms to ward
2139,SURPRISE,off such meaningless intrusions.”
2140,SURPRISE,
2141,SURPRISE,“With an excellent verbosity you mock the concentration of your
2142,SURPRISE,"thoughts,” he said."
2143,SURPRISE,
2144,SURPRISE,They closed their eyes and grew still in the chair. When at last they
2145,SURPRISE,"stirred, each one looked first at the room and then at the other"
2146,SURPRISE,"person, with a gradually slain disbelief."
2147,SURPRISE,
2148,SURPRISE,"“We are not dead after all,” he cried. “The room does not fade away!”"
2149,SURPRISE,
2150,SURPRISE,"They sat without moving, while happiness and sadness sprang into combat"
2151,SURPRISE,within them.
