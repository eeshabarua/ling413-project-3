182,AUTUMN CHANT,Now the autumn shudders
183,AUTUMN CHANT,In the rose’s root.
184,AUTUMN CHANT,Far and wide the ladders
185,AUTUMN CHANT,Lean among the fruit.
186,AUTUMN CHANT,
187,AUTUMN CHANT,Now the autumn clambers
188,AUTUMN CHANT,"Up the trellised frame,"
189,AUTUMN CHANT,And the rose remembers
190,AUTUMN CHANT,The dust from which it came.
191,AUTUMN CHANT,
192,AUTUMN CHANT,Brighter than the blossom
193,AUTUMN CHANT,On the rose’s bough
194,AUTUMN CHANT,"Sits the wizened, orange,"
195,AUTUMN CHANT,Bitter berry now;
196,AUTUMN CHANT,
197,AUTUMN CHANT,Beauty never slumbers;
198,AUTUMN CHANT,All is in her name;

208,NUIT BLANCHE,"That climb a wall by night,"
209,NUIT BLANCHE,"One after one, until I sleep,"
210,NUIT BLANCHE,Or the black pane goes white.
211,NUIT BLANCHE,Because of which I cannot see
212,NUIT BLANCHE,"A flock upon a hill,"
213,NUIT BLANCHE,But doubts come tittering up to me
214,NUIT BLANCHE,That should by day be still.
215,NUIT BLANCHE,And childish griefs I have outgrown
216,NUIT BLANCHE,"Into my eyes are thrust,"
217,NUIT BLANCHE,Till my dull tears go dropping down
218,NUIT BLANCHE,Like lead into the dust.

231,I,"Oh, little rose tree, bloom!"
232,I,Summer is nearly over.
233,I,"The dahlias bleed, and the phlox is seed."
234,I,Nothing’s left of the clover.
235,I,And the path of the poppy no one knows.
236,I,I would blossom if I were a rose.
237,I,
238,I,"Summer, for all your guile,"
239,I,"Will brown in a week to Autumn,"
240,I,And launched leaves throw a shadow below
241,I,"Over the brook’s clear bottom,--"
242,I,And the chariest bud the year can boast
243,I,Be brought to bloom by the chastening frost.

253,II,The heart grows weary after a little
254,II,Of what it loved for a little while.
255,II,
256,II,Weave me a robe of richer fibre;
257,II,Pattern its web with a rare device.
258,II,Give away to the child of a neighbor
259,II,This gold gown I was glad in twice.
260,II,
261,II,But buy me a singer to sing one song--
262,II,Song about nothing--song about sheep--

276,III,Over the nettles.
277,III,Where is the voice that I heard crying?
278,III,
279,III,Sand at last
280,III,On the drifting mast.
281,III,And where is the voice that I heard crying?

294,THE WOOD ROAD,"Hand in hand with Grief,"

296,THE WOOD ROAD,Coming into leaf.
297,THE WOOD ROAD,I should note how the old burrs
298,THE WOOD ROAD,Rot upon the ground.
299,THE WOOD ROAD,"Yes, though Grief should know me hers"
300,THE WOOD ROAD,"While the world goes round,"
301,THE WOOD ROAD,It could not in truth be said
302,THE WOOD ROAD,This was lost on me;
303,THE WOOD ROAD,"A rock-maple showing red,"
304,THE WOOD ROAD,Burrs beneath a tree.

316,FEAST,
317,FEAST,I gnawed at every root.
318,FEAST,I ate of every plant.
319,FEAST,I came upon no fruit
320,FEAST,So wonderful as want.
321,FEAST,
322,FEAST,Feed the grape and bean
323,FEAST,To the vintner and monger;
324,FEAST,I will lie down lean

336,SOUVENIR,Saving half an hour.
337,SOUVENIR,
338,SOUVENIR,Marred by greeting passing groups
339,SOUVENIR,"In a cinder walk,"
340,SOUVENIR,Near some naked blackberry hoops
341,SOUVENIR,Dim with purple chalk.
342,SOUVENIR,
343,SOUVENIR,I remember three or four
344,SOUVENIR,"Things you said in spite,"
345,SOUVENIR,"And an ugly coat you wore,"
346,SOUVENIR,Plaided black and white.
347,SOUVENIR,
348,SOUVENIR,Just a rainy day or two

362,SCRUB,Puckered fruit that sears the mouth;
363,SCRUB,If I make of my drawn boughs
364,SCRUB,"An inhospitable house,"
365,SCRUB,Out of which I never pry
366,SCRUB,"Towards the water and the sky,"
367,SCRUB,Under which I stand and hide
368,SCRUB,And hear the day go by outside;
369,SCRUB,It is that a wind too strong
370,SCRUB,"Bent my back when I was young,"
371,SCRUB,It is that I fear the rain
372,SCRUB,Lest it blister me again.

401,THE DRAGONFLY,"Men behold me, a worm spun-out and dead,"
402,THE DRAGONFLY,Walled in an iron house of silky singing.
403,THE DRAGONFLY,
404,THE DRAGONFLY,"Nevertheless at length, O reedy shallows,"
405,THE DRAGONFLY,"Not as a plodding nose to the slimy stem,"

517,THE SPRING AND THE FALL,The trees were black where the bark was wet.
518,THE SPRING AND THE FALL,"I see them yet, in the spring of the year."
519,THE SPRING AND THE FALL,He broke me a bough of the blossoming peach
520,THE SPRING AND THE FALL,That was out of the way and hard to reach.
521,THE SPRING AND THE FALL,
522,THE SPRING AND THE FALL,"In the fall of the year, in the fall of the year,"

800,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
801,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And gold threads whistling

806,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"She wove a child’s jacket,"
807,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And when it was done
808,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,She laid it on the floor
809,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And wove another one.
810,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
811,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,She wove a red cloak
812,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"So regal to see,"

815,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,But I knew it was for me.
816,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
817,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,She wove a pair of breeches
818,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,Quicker than that!
819,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,She wove a pair of boots
820,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And a little cocked hat.
821,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
822,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"She wove a pair of mittens,"

825,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"In the still, cold house."
826,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
827,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"She sang as she worked,"
828,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And the harp-strings spoke;

830,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And the thread never broke.
831,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"And when I awoke,--"

837,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
838,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"A smile about her lips,"
839,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,"And a light about her head,"
840,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And her hands in the harp-strings
841,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,Frozen dead.
842,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,
843,THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER,And piled up beside her
