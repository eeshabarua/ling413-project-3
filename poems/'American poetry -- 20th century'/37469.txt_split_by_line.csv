83,PREFACE,
84,PREFACE,In bringing the second volume of _Some Imagist Poets_ before the
85,PREFACE,"public, the authors wish to express their gratitude for the interest"
86,PREFACE,"which the 1915 volume aroused. The discussion of it was widespread,"
87,PREFACE,and even those critics out of sympathy with Imagist tenets accorded
88,PREFACE,"it much space. In the Preface to that book, we endeavoured to present"
89,PREFACE,those tenets in a succinct form. But the very brevity we employed has
90,PREFACE,"lead to a great deal of misunderstanding. We have decided, therefore,"
91,PREFACE,to explain the laws which govern us a little more fully. A few people
92,PREFACE,"may understand, and the rest can merely misunderstand again, a result"
93,PREFACE,to which we are quite accustomed.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"In the first place ""Imagism"" does not mean merely the presentation of"
96,PREFACE,"pictures. ""Imagism"" refers to the manner of presentation, not to the"
97,PREFACE,subject. It means a clear presentation of whatever the author wishes
98,PREFACE,"to convey. Now he may wish to convey a mood of indecision, in which"
99,PREFACE,case the poem should be indecisive; he may wish to bring before his
100,PREFACE,"reader the constantly shifting and changing lights over a landscape,"
101,PREFACE,"or the varying attitudes of mind of a person under strong emotion,"
102,PREFACE,then his poem must shift and change to present this clearly. The
103,PREFACE,"""exact"" word does not mean the word which exactly describes the"
104,PREFACE,"object in itself, it means the ""exact"" word which brings the effect"
105,PREFACE,of that object before the reader as it presented itself to the poet's
106,PREFACE,mind at the time of writing the poem. Imagists deal but little with
107,PREFACE,"similes, although much of their poetry is metaphorical. The reason"
108,PREFACE,for this is that while acknowledging the figure to be an integral
109,PREFACE,"part of all poetry, they feel that the constant imposing of one"
110,PREFACE,figure upon another in the same poem blurs the central effect.
111,PREFACE,
112,PREFACE,"The great French critic, Remy de Gourmont, wrote last Summer in _La"
113,PREFACE,France_ that the Imagists were the descendants of the French
114,PREFACE,"_Symbolistes_. In the Preface to his _Livre des Masques_, M. de"
115,PREFACE,"Gourmont has thus described _Symbolisme_: ""Individualism in"
116,PREFACE,"literature, liberty of art, abandonment of existing forms.... The"
117,PREFACE,sole excuse which a man can have for writing is to write down
118,PREFACE,"himself, to unveil for others the sort of world which mirrors itself"
119,PREFACE,in his individual glass.... He should create his own aesthetics--and
120,PREFACE,"we should admit as many aesthetics as there are original minds, and"
121,PREFACE,"judge them for what they are and not what they are not."" In this"
122,PREFACE,sense the Imagists are descendants of the _Symbolistes_; they are
123,PREFACE,Individualists.
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,The only reason that Imagism has seemed so anarchaic and strange to
126,PREFACE,English and American reviewers is that their minds do not easily and
127,PREFACE,quickly suggest the steps by which modern art has arrived at its
128,PREFACE,present position. Its immediate prototype cannot be found in English
129,PREFACE,"or American literature, we must turn to Europe for it. With Debussy"
130,PREFACE,"and Stravinsky in music, and Gauguin and Matisse in painting, it"
131,PREFACE,should have been evident to every one that art was entering upon an
132,PREFACE,"era of change. But music and painting are universal languages, so we"
133,PREFACE,"have become accustomed to new idioms in them, while we still find it"
134,PREFACE,hard to recognize a changed idiom in literature.
135,PREFACE,
136,PREFACE,The crux of the situation is just here. It is in the idiom employed.
137,PREFACE,Imagism asks to be judged by different standards from those employed
138,PREFACE,in Nineteenth-Century art. It is small wonder that Imagist poetry
139,PREFACE,should be incomprehensible to men whose sole touchstone for art is
140,PREFACE,the literature of one country for a period of four centuries. And it
141,PREFACE,is an illuminating fact that among poets and men conversant with many
142,PREFACE,"poetic idioms, Imagism is rarely misconceived. They may not agree"
143,PREFACE,"with us, but they do not misunderstand us."
144,PREFACE,
145,PREFACE,This must not be misconstrued into the desire to belittle our
146,PREFACE,"forerunners. On the contrary, the Imagists have the greatest"
147,PREFACE,"admiration for the past, and humility towards it. But they have been"
148,PREFACE,"caught in the throes of a new birth. The exterior world is changing,"
149,PREFACE,"and with it men's feelings, and every age must express its feelings"
150,PREFACE,"in its own individual way. No art is any more ""egoistic"" than"
151,PREFACE,"another; all art is an attempt to express the feelings of the artist,"
152,PREFACE,whether it be couched in narrative form or employ a more personal
153,PREFACE,expression.
154,PREFACE,
155,PREFACE,It is not what Imagists write about which makes them hard of
156,PREFACE,comprehension; it is the way they write it. All nations have laws of
157,PREFACE,"prosody, which undergo changes from time to time. The laws of English"
158,PREFACE,metrical prosody are well known to every one concerned with the
159,PREFACE,subject. But that is only one form of prosody. Other nations have had
160,PREFACE,"different ones: Anglo-Saxon poetry was founded upon alliteration,"
161,PREFACE,"Greek and Roman was built upon quantity, the Oriental was formed out"
162,PREFACE,"of repetition, and the Japanese Hokku got its effects by an exact and"
163,PREFACE,never-to-be-added-to series of single syllables. So it is evident
164,PREFACE,that poetry can be written in many modes. That the Imagists base much
165,PREFACE,of their poetry upon cadence and not upon metre makes them neither
166,PREFACE,good nor bad. And no one realizes more than they that no theories nor
167,PREFACE,rules make poetry. They claim for their work only that it is sincere.
168,PREFACE,
169,PREFACE,"It is this very fact of ""cadence"" which has misled so many reviewers,"
170,PREFACE,until some have been betrayed into saying that the Imagists discard
171,PREFACE,"rhythm, when rhythm is the most important quality in their technique."
172,PREFACE,The definition of _vers libre_ is--a verse-form based upon cadence.
173,PREFACE,"Now cadence in music is one thing, cadence in poetry quite another,"
174,PREFACE,since we are not dealing with tone but with rhythm. It is the sense
175,PREFACE,of perfect balance of flow and rhythm. Not only must the syllables so
176,PREFACE,"fall as to increase and continue the movement, but the whole poem"
177,PREFACE,must be as rounded and recurring as the circular swing of a balanced
178,PREFACE,"pendulum. It can be fast or slow, it may even jerk, but this perfect"
179,PREFACE,"swing it must have, even its jerks must follow the central movement."
180,PREFACE,"To illustrate: Suppose a person were given the task of walking, or"
181,PREFACE,"running, round a large circle, with two minutes given to do it in."
182,PREFACE,Two minutes which he would just consume if he walked round the circle
183,PREFACE,"quietly. But in order to make the task easier for him, or harder, as"
184,PREFACE,"the case might be, he was required to complete each half of the"
185,PREFACE,circle in exactly a minute. No other restrictions were placed upon
186,PREFACE,"him. He might dawdle in the beginning, and run madly to reach the"
187,PREFACE,"half-circle mark on time, and then complete his task by walking"
188,PREFACE,"steadily round the second half to goal. Or he might leap, and run,"
189,PREFACE,"and skip, and linger in all sorts of ways, making up for slow going"
190,PREFACE,"by fast, and for extra haste by pauses, and varying these movements"
191,PREFACE,"on either lap of the circle as the humour seized him, only so that he"
192,PREFACE,"were just one minute in traversing the first half-circle, and just"
193,PREFACE,one minute in traversing the second. Another illustration which may
194,PREFACE,be employed is that of a Japanese wood-carving where a toad in one
195,PREFACE,corner is balanced by a spray of blown flowers in the opposite upper
196,PREFACE,"one. The flowers are not the same shape as the toad, neither are they"
197,PREFACE,"the same size, but the balance is preserved."
198,PREFACE,
199,PREFACE,"The unit in _vers libre_ is not the foot, the number of the"
200,PREFACE,"syllables, the quantity, or the line. The unit is the strophe, which"
201,PREFACE,"may be the whole poem, or may be only a part. Each strophe is a"
202,PREFACE,"complete circle: in fact, the meaning of the Greek word ""strophe"" is"
203,PREFACE,simply that part of the poem which was recited while the chorus were
204,PREFACE,making a turn round the altar set up in the centre of the theatre.
205,PREFACE,"The simile of the circle is more than a simile, therefore; it is a"
206,PREFACE,"fact. Of course the circle need not always be the same size, nor need"
207,PREFACE,the times allowed to negotiate it be always the same. There is room
208,PREFACE,"here for an infinite number of variations. Also, circles can be added"
209,PREFACE,"to circles, movement upon movement, to the poem, provided each"
210,PREFACE,"movement completes itself, and ramifies naturally into the next. But"
211,PREFACE,one thing must be borne in mind: a cadenced poem is written to be
212,PREFACE,"read aloud, in this way only will its rhythm be felt. Poetry is a"
213,PREFACE,spoken and not a written art.
214,PREFACE,
215,PREFACE,The _vers libristes_ are often accused of declaring that they have
216,PREFACE,"discovered a new thing. Where such an idea started, it is impossible"
217,PREFACE,"to say, certainly none of the better _vers libristes_ was ever guilty"
218,PREFACE,"of so ridiculous a statement. The name _vers libre_ is new, the"
219,PREFACE,"thing, most emphatically, is not. Not new in English poetry, at any"
220,PREFACE,rate. You will find something very much like it in Dryden's
221,PREFACE,_Threnodia Augustalis_; a great deal of Milton's _Samson Agonistes_
222,PREFACE,is written in it; and Matthew Arnold's _Philomela_ is a shining
223,PREFACE,example of it. Practically all of Henley's _London Voluntaries_ are
224,PREFACE,"written in it, and (so potent are names) until it was christened"
225,PREFACE,"_vers libre_, no one thought of objecting to it. But the oldest"
226,PREFACE,reference to _vers libre_ is to be found in Chaucer's _House of
227,PREFACE,"Fame_, where the Eagle addresses the Poet in these words:"
228,PREFACE,
229,PREFACE,And nevertheless hast set thy wyt
230,PREFACE,Although that in thy heed full lyte is
231,PREFACE,"To make bookes, songes, or dytees"
232,PREFACE,In rhyme or elles in cadence.
233,PREFACE,
234,PREFACE,Commentators have wasted reams of paper in an endeavour to determine
235,PREFACE,what Chaucer meant by this. But is it not possible that he meant a
236,PREFACE,"verse based upon rhythm, but which did not follow the strict metrical"
237,PREFACE,prosody of his usual practice?
238,PREFACE,
239,PREFACE,One of the charges frequently brought against the Imagists is that
240,PREFACE,"they write, not poetry, but ""shredded prose."" This misconception"
241,PREFACE,springs from the almost complete ignorance of the public in regard to
242,PREFACE,"the laws of cadenced verse. But, in fact, what is prose and what is"
243,PREFACE,poetry? Is it merely a matter of typographical arrangement? Must
244,PREFACE,"everything which is printed in equal lines, with rhymes at the ends,"
245,PREFACE,"be called poetry, and everything which is printed in a block be"
246,PREFACE,"called prose? Aristotle, who certainly knew more about this subject"
247,PREFACE,"than any one else, declares in his _Rhetoric_ that prose is"
248,PREFACE,"rhythmical without being metrical (that is to say, without insistence"
249,PREFACE,"on any single rhythm), and then goes on to state the feet that are"
250,PREFACE,"employed in prose, making, incidentally, the remark that the iambic"
251,PREFACE,"prevailed in ordinary conversation. The fact is, that there is no"
252,PREFACE,hard and fast dividing line between prose and poetry. As a French
253,PREFACE,"poet of distinction, Paul Fort, has said: ""Prose and poetry are but"
254,PREFACE,"one instrument, graduated."" It is not a question of typography; it is"
255,PREFACE,not even a question of rules and forms. Poetry is the vision in a
256,PREFACE,man's soul which he translates as best he can with the means at his
257,PREFACE,disposal.
258,PREFACE,
259,PREFACE,"We are young, we are experimentalists, but we ask to be judged by our"
260,PREFACE,"own standards, not by those which have governed other men at other"
261,PREFACE,times.

418,EROS AND PSYCHE,"And their young fresh lust to Camden Town,"
419,EROS AND PSYCHE,"Which settled long ago to toil and sweat and filth,"

428,EROS AND PSYCHE,"Half an inch deep,"
429,EROS AND PSYCHE,"And his wings, the tall god's wings,"
430,EROS AND PSYCHE,That should be red and silver
431,EROS AND PSYCHE,Are ocherous brown.

832,IV,
833,IV,"Though oak-beams split,"
834,IV,"Though boats and sea-men flounder,"
835,IV,And the strait grind sand with sand
836,IV,And cut boulders to sand and drift--
837,IV,
838,IV,Your eyes have pardoned our faults.
839,IV,Your hands have touched us.
840,IV,You have leaned forward a little
841,IV,And the waves can never thrust us back
842,IV,From the splendour of your ragged coast.

1297,EASTER,"We lurch on, and, stumbling,"
1298,EASTER,touch each other.
1299,EASTER,"You do not shrink, friend."
1300,EASTER,"There you, and I here,"
1301,EASTER,"side by side, we go, jesting."
1302,EASTER,"We do not seek, we do not avoid, contact."
1303,EASTER,
1304,EASTER,"Here is the road,"
1305,EASTER,"with the budding elm-trees lining it,"
1306,EASTER,and there the low gate in the wall;
1307,EASTER,"on the other side, the people."
1308,EASTER,Are they not aliens?
1309,EASTER,You and I for a moment see them
1310,EASTER,"shabby of limb and soul,"
1311,EASTER,patched up to make shift.
1312,EASTER,We laugh and strengthen each other;
1313,EASTER,But the evil is done.
1314,EASTER,
1315,EASTER,"Is not the whole park made for them,"
1316,EASTER,"and the bushes and plants and trees and grasses,"
1317,EASTER,have they not grown to their standard?
1318,EASTER,The paths are worn to the gravel with their feet;
1319,EASTER,the green moss will not carpet them.
1320,EASTER,The flags of the stone steps are hollowed;
1321,EASTER,and you and I must strive to remain two
1322,EASTER,and not to merge in the multitude.
1323,EASTER,It impinges on us; it separates us;
1324,EASTER,we shrink from it; we brave through it;
1325,EASTER,we laugh; we jest; we jeer;
1326,EASTER,and we save the fragments of our souls.
1327,EASTER,
1328,EASTER,Between two clipped privet hedges now;
1329,EASTER,we will close our eyes for life's sake
1330,EASTER,to life's patches.
1331,EASTER,"Here, maybe, there is quiet;"
1332,EASTER,"pass first under the bare branches,"
1333,EASTER,"beyond is a pool flanked with sedge,"
1334,EASTER,and a swan among water-lilies.
1335,EASTER,But here too is a group
1336,EASTER,of men and women and children;
1337,EASTER,and the swan has forgotten its pride;
1338,EASTER,"it thrusts its white neck among them,"
1339,EASTER,and gobbles at nothing;
1340,EASTER,then tires of the cheat and sails off;
1341,EASTER,but its breast urges before it
1342,EASTER,a sheet of sodden newspaper
1343,EASTER,"that, drifting away,"
1344,EASTER,reveals beneath the immaculate white splendour
1345,EASTER,of its neck and wings
1346,EASTER,a breast black with scum.

1412,GLOOM,
1413,GLOOM,I sat there in the dark
1414,GLOOM,of the room and of my mind
1415,GLOOM,"thinking of men's treasons and bad faith,"
1416,GLOOM,sinking into the pit of my own weakness
1417,GLOOM,before their strength of cunning.
1418,GLOOM,Out over the gardens came the sound of some one
1419,GLOOM,playing five-finger exercises on the piano.
1420,GLOOM,
1421,GLOOM,Then
1422,GLOOM,I gathered up within me all my powers
1423,GLOOM,until outside of me was nothing:
1424,GLOOM,I was all--
1425,GLOOM,"all stubborn, fighting sadness and revulsion."
1426,GLOOM,
1427,GLOOM,"And one came from the garden quietly,"
1428,GLOOM,and stood beside me.
1429,GLOOM,She laid her hand on my hair;
1430,GLOOM,"she laid her cheek on my forehead,--"
1431,GLOOM,and caressed me with it;
1432,GLOOM,but all my being rose to my forehead
1433,GLOOM,to fight against this outside thing.
1434,GLOOM,Something in me became angry;
1435,GLOOM,"withstood like a wall,"
1436,GLOOM,and would allow no entrance;
1437,GLOOM,I hated her.
1438,GLOOM,
1439,GLOOM,"""What is the matter with you, dear?"" she said."
1440,GLOOM,"""Nothing,"" I answered,"
1441,GLOOM,"""I am thinking."""
1442,GLOOM,She stroked my hair and went away;
1443,GLOOM,"and I was still gloomy, angry, stubborn."
1444,GLOOM,
1445,GLOOM,Then I thought:
1446,GLOOM,she has gone away; she is hurt;
1447,GLOOM,she does not know
1448,GLOOM,what poison has been working in me.
1449,GLOOM,
1450,GLOOM,Then I thought:
1451,GLOOM,"upstairs, her child is sleeping;"
1452,GLOOM,and I felt the presence
1453,GLOOM,"of the fields we had walked over, the roads we had followed,"
1454,GLOOM,"the flowers we had watched together,"
1455,GLOOM,before it came.
1456,GLOOM,
1457,GLOOM,"She had touched my hair, and only then did I feel it;"
1458,GLOOM,And I loved her once again.
1459,GLOOM,
1460,GLOOM,"And I came away,"
1461,GLOOM,full of the sweet and bitter juices of life;
1462,GLOOM,"and I lit the lamp in my room,"
1463,GLOOM,and made this poem.

1534,CHALFONT SAINT GILES,Pass on;
1535,CHALFONT SAINT GILES,"this is the church-porch,"
1536,CHALFONT SAINT GILES,"and within the bell-ringers,"

1583,WAR-TIME,I will pass the shops where the prices
