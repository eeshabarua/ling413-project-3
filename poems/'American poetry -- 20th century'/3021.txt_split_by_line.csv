15,CONTENTS,CONTENTS
16,CONTENTS,
17,CONTENTS,Part I
18,CONTENTS,Into My Own
19,CONTENTS,The youth is persuaded that he will be rather more than less himself
20,CONTENTS,for having forsworn the world.
21,CONTENTS,Ghost House
22,CONTENTS,He is happy in society of his choosing.
23,CONTENTS,My November Guest
24,CONTENTS,He is in love with being misunderstood.
25,CONTENTS,Love and a Question
26,CONTENTS,He is in doubt whether to admit real trouble to a place beside the
27,CONTENTS,hearth with love.
28,CONTENTS,A Late Walk
29,CONTENTS,He courts the autumnal mood.

31,CONTENTS,There is no oversight of human affairs.
32,CONTENTS,Storm Fear
33,CONTENTS,He is afraid of his own isolation.
34,CONTENTS,Wind and Window Flower
35,CONTENTS,Out of the winter things he fashions a story of modern love.
36,CONTENTS,To the Thawing Wind (audio)
37,CONTENTS,He calls on change through the violence of the elements.
38,CONTENTS,A Prayer in Spring
39,CONTENTS,He discovers that the greatness of love lies not in forward-looking
40,CONTENTS,thoughts;
41,CONTENTS,Flower-gathering
42,CONTENTS,nor yet in any spur it may be to ambition.
43,CONTENTS,Rose Pogonias
44,CONTENTS,He is no dissenter from the ritualism of nature;
45,CONTENTS,Asking for Roses
46,CONTENTS,nor from the ritualism of youth which is make-believe.
47,CONTENTS,Waiting--Afield at Dusk
48,CONTENTS,He arrives at the turn of the year.
49,CONTENTS,In a Vale
50,CONTENTS,Out of old longings he fashions a story.
51,CONTENTS,A Dream Pang
52,CONTENTS,He is shown by a dream how really well it is with him.
53,CONTENTS,In Neglect
54,CONTENTS,He is scornful of folk his scorn cannot reach.
55,CONTENTS,The Vantage Point
56,CONTENTS,"And again scornful, but there is no one hurt."
57,CONTENTS,Mowing
58,CONTENTS,He takes up life simply with the small tasks.
59,CONTENTS,Going for Water
60,CONTENTS,
61,CONTENTS,Part II
62,CONTENTS,Revelation
63,CONTENTS,"He resolves to become intelligible, at least to himself, since there"
64,CONTENTS,is no help else;
65,CONTENTS,The Trial by Existence
66,CONTENTS,and to know definitely what he thinks about the soul;
67,CONTENTS,In Equal Sacrifice
68,CONTENTS,about love;
69,CONTENTS,The Tuft of Flowers
70,CONTENTS,about fellowship;
71,CONTENTS,Spoils of the Dead
72,CONTENTS,about death;
73,CONTENTS,Pan with Us
74,CONTENTS,about art (his own);
75,CONTENTS,The Demiurge's Laugh
76,CONTENTS,about science.
77,CONTENTS,
78,CONTENTS,Part III
79,CONTENTS,Now Close the Windows
80,CONTENTS,It is time to make an end of speaking.
81,CONTENTS,A Line-storm Song
82,CONTENTS,It is the autumnal mood with a difference.
83,CONTENTS,October
84,CONTENTS,He sees days slipping from him that were the best for what they
85,CONTENTS,were.
86,CONTENTS,My Butterfly
87,CONTENTS,There are things that can never be the same.
88,CONTENTS,Reluctance
89,CONTENTS,
90,CONTENTS,
91,CONTENTS,
92,CONTENTS,
93,CONTENTS,Into My Own
94,CONTENTS,
95,CONTENTS,"ONE of my wishes is that those dark trees,"
96,CONTENTS,"So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,"
97,CONTENTS,"Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,"
98,CONTENTS,But stretched away unto the edge of doom.
99,CONTENTS,I should not be withheld but that some day
100,CONTENTS,"Into their vastness I should steal away,"
101,CONTENTS,"Fearless of ever finding open land,"
102,CONTENTS,Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.
103,CONTENTS,"I do not see why I should e'er turn back,"
104,CONTENTS,Or those should not set forth upon my track
105,CONTENTS,"To overtake me, who should miss me here"
106,CONTENTS,And long to know if still I held them dear.
107,CONTENTS,They would not find me changed from him they knew--
108,CONTENTS,Only more sure of all I thought was true.
109,CONTENTS,
110,CONTENTS,
111,CONTENTS,
112,CONTENTS,
113,CONTENTS,Ghost House
114,CONTENTS,
115,CONTENTS,I DWELL in a lonely house I know
116,CONTENTS,"That vanished many a summer ago,"
117,CONTENTS,"And left no trace but the cellar walls,"
118,CONTENTS,"And a cellar in which the daylight falls,"
119,CONTENTS,And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.
120,CONTENTS,O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield
121,CONTENTS,The woods come back to the mowing field;
122,CONTENTS,The orchard tree has grown one copse
123,CONTENTS,Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;
124,CONTENTS,The footpath down to the well is healed.
125,CONTENTS,I dwell with a strangely aching heart
126,CONTENTS,In that vanished abode there far apart
127,CONTENTS,On that disused and forgotten road
128,CONTENTS,That has no dust-bath now for the toad.
129,CONTENTS,Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;
130,CONTENTS,The whippoorwill is coming to shout
131,CONTENTS,And hush and cluck and flutter about:
132,CONTENTS,I hear him begin far enough away
133,CONTENTS,Full many a time to say his say
134,CONTENTS,Before he arrives to say it out.
135,CONTENTS,"It is under the small, dim, summer star."
136,CONTENTS,I know not who these mute folk are
137,CONTENTS,Who share the unlit place with me--
138,CONTENTS,Those stones out under the low-limbed tree
139,CONTENTS,Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.
140,CONTENTS,"They are tireless folk, but slow and sad,"
141,CONTENTS,"Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--"
142,CONTENTS,"With none among them that ever sings,"
143,CONTENTS,"And yet, in view of how many things,"
144,CONTENTS,As sweet companions as might be had.
145,CONTENTS,
146,CONTENTS,
147,CONTENTS,
148,CONTENTS,
149,CONTENTS,My November Guest
150,CONTENTS,
151,CONTENTS,"MY Sorrow, when she's here with me,"
152,CONTENTS,Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
153,CONTENTS,Are beautiful as days can be;
154,CONTENTS,"She loves the bare, the withered tree;"
155,CONTENTS,She walks the sodden pasture lane.
156,CONTENTS,Her pleasure will not let me stay.
157,CONTENTS,She talks and I am fain to list:
158,CONTENTS,"She's glad the birds are gone away,"
159,CONTENTS,She's glad her simple worsted gray
160,CONTENTS,Is silver now with clinging mist.
161,CONTENTS,"The desolate, deserted trees,"
162,CONTENTS,"The faded earth, the heavy sky,"
163,CONTENTS,"The beauties she so truly sees,"
164,CONTENTS,"She thinks I have no eye for these,"
165,CONTENTS,And vexes me for reason why.
166,CONTENTS,Not yesterday I learned to know
167,CONTENTS,The love of bare November days
168,CONTENTS,"Before the coming of the snow,"
169,CONTENTS,"But it were vain to tell her so,"
170,CONTENTS,And they are better for her praise.
171,CONTENTS,
172,CONTENTS,
173,CONTENTS,
174,CONTENTS,
175,CONTENTS,Love and a Question
176,CONTENTS,
177,CONTENTS,"A STRANGER came to the door at eve,"
178,CONTENTS,And he spoke the bridegroom fair.
179,CONTENTS,"He bore a green-white stick in his hand,"
180,CONTENTS,"And, for all burden, care."
181,CONTENTS,He asked with the eyes more than the lips
182,CONTENTS,"For a shelter for the night,"
183,CONTENTS,And he turned and looked at the road afar
184,CONTENTS,Without a window light.
185,CONTENTS,The bridegroom came forth into the porch
186,CONTENTS,"With, 'Let us look at the sky,"
187,CONTENTS,"And question what of the night to be,"
188,CONTENTS,"Stranger, you and I.'"
189,CONTENTS,"The woodbine leaves littered the yard,"
190,CONTENTS,"The woodbine berries were blue,"
191,CONTENTS,"Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;"
192,CONTENTS,"'Stranger, I wish I knew.'"
193,CONTENTS,"Within, the bride in the dusk alone"
194,CONTENTS,"Bent over the open fire,"
195,CONTENTS,Her face rose-red with the glowing coal
196,CONTENTS,And the thought of the heart's desire.
197,CONTENTS,"The bridegroom looked at the weary road,"
198,CONTENTS,"Yet saw but her within,"
199,CONTENTS,And wished her heart in a case of gold
200,CONTENTS,And pinned with a silver pin.
201,CONTENTS,The bridegroom thought it little to give
202,CONTENTS,"A dole of bread, a purse,"
203,CONTENTS,"A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,"
204,CONTENTS,Or for the rich a curse;
205,CONTENTS,But whether or not a man was asked
206,CONTENTS,To mar the love of two
207,CONTENTS,"By harboring woe in the bridal house,"
208,CONTENTS,The bridegroom wished he knew.
209,CONTENTS,
210,CONTENTS,
211,CONTENTS,
212,CONTENTS,
213,CONTENTS,A Late Walk
214,CONTENTS,
215,CONTENTS,"WHEN I go up through the mowing field,"
216,CONTENTS,"The headless aftermath,"
217,CONTENTS,"Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,"
218,CONTENTS,Half closes the garden path.
219,CONTENTS,"And when I come to the garden ground,"
220,CONTENTS,The whir of sober birds
221,CONTENTS,Up from the tangle of withered weeds
222,CONTENTS,Is sadder than any words.
223,CONTENTS,"A tree beside the wall stands bare,"
224,CONTENTS,"But a leaf that lingered brown,"
225,CONTENTS,"Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,"
226,CONTENTS,Comes softly rattling down.
227,CONTENTS,I end not far from my going forth
228,CONTENTS,By picking the faded blue
229,CONTENTS,Of the last remaining aster flower
230,CONTENTS,To carry again to you.
231,CONTENTS,
232,CONTENTS,
233,CONTENTS,
234,CONTENTS,
235,CONTENTS,Stars
236,CONTENTS,
237,CONTENTS,HOW countlessly they congregate
238,CONTENTS,"O'er our tumultuous snow,"
239,CONTENTS,Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
240,CONTENTS,When wintry winds do blow!--
241,CONTENTS,"As if with keenness for our fate,"
242,CONTENTS,Our faltering few steps on
243,CONTENTS,"To white rest, and a place of rest"
244,CONTENTS,"Invisible at dawn,--"
245,CONTENTS,"And yet with neither love nor hate,"
246,CONTENTS,Those stars like some snow-white
247,CONTENTS,Minerva's snow-white marble eyes
248,CONTENTS,Without the gift of sight.
249,CONTENTS,
250,CONTENTS,
251,CONTENTS,
252,CONTENTS,
253,CONTENTS,Storm Fear
254,CONTENTS,
255,CONTENTS,"WHEN the wind works against us in the dark,"
256,CONTENTS,And pelts with snow
257,CONTENTS,"The lowest chamber window on the east,"
258,CONTENTS,"And whispers with a sort of stifled bark,"
259,CONTENTS,"The beast,"
260,CONTENTS,'Come out! Come out!'--
261,CONTENTS,"It costs no inward struggle not to go,"
262,CONTENTS,"Ah, no!"
263,CONTENTS,"I count our strength,"
264,CONTENTS,"Two and a child,"
265,CONTENTS,Those of us not asleep subdued to mark
266,CONTENTS,"How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,--"
267,CONTENTS,"How drifts are piled,"
268,CONTENTS,"Dooryard and road ungraded,"
269,CONTENTS,Till even the comforting barn grows far away
270,CONTENTS,And my heart owns a doubt
271,CONTENTS,Whether 'tis in us to arise with day
272,CONTENTS,And save ourselves unaided.
273,CONTENTS,
274,CONTENTS,
275,CONTENTS,
276,CONTENTS,
277,CONTENTS,Wind and Window Flower
278,CONTENTS,
279,CONTENTS,"LOVERS, forget your love,"
280,CONTENTS,"And list to the love of these,"
281,CONTENTS,"She a window flower,"
282,CONTENTS,And he a winter breeze.
283,CONTENTS,When the frosty window veil
284,CONTENTS,"Was melted down at noon,"
285,CONTENTS,And the cagèd yellow bird
286,CONTENTS,"Hung over her in tune,"
287,CONTENTS,"He marked her through the pane,"
288,CONTENTS,"He could not help but mark,"
289,CONTENTS,"And only passed her by,"
290,CONTENTS,To come again at dark.
291,CONTENTS,"He was a winter wind,"
292,CONTENTS,"Concerned with ice and snow,"
293,CONTENTS,"Dead weeds and unmated birds,"
294,CONTENTS,And little of love could know.
295,CONTENTS,"But he sighed upon the sill,"
296,CONTENTS,"He gave the sash a shake,"
297,CONTENTS,As witness all within
298,CONTENTS,Who lay that night awake.
299,CONTENTS,Perchance he half prevailed
300,CONTENTS,To win her for the flight
301,CONTENTS,From the firelit looking-glass
302,CONTENTS,And warm stove-window light.
303,CONTENTS,But the flower leaned aside
304,CONTENTS,"And thought of naught to say,"
305,CONTENTS,And morning found the breeze
306,CONTENTS,A hundred miles away.
307,CONTENTS,
308,CONTENTS,
309,CONTENTS,
310,CONTENTS,
311,CONTENTS,To the Thawing Wind (audio)
312,CONTENTS,
313,CONTENTS,"COME with rain, O loud Southwester!"
314,CONTENTS,"Bring the singer, bring the nester;"
315,CONTENTS,Give the buried flower a dream;
316,CONTENTS,Make the settled snow-bank steam;
317,CONTENTS,Find the brown beneath the white;
318,CONTENTS,"But whate'er you do to-night,"
319,CONTENTS,"Bathe my window, make it flow,"
320,CONTENTS,Melt it as the ices go;
321,CONTENTS,Melt the glass and leave the sticks
322,CONTENTS,Like a hermit's crucifix;
323,CONTENTS,Burst into my narrow stall;
324,CONTENTS,Swing the picture on the wall;
325,CONTENTS,Run the rattling pages o'er;
326,CONTENTS,Scatter poems on the floor;
327,CONTENTS,Turn the poet out of door.
328,CONTENTS,
329,CONTENTS,
330,CONTENTS,
331,CONTENTS,
332,CONTENTS,A Prayer in Spring
333,CONTENTS,
334,CONTENTS,"OH, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day;"
335,CONTENTS,And give us not to think so far away
336,CONTENTS,As the uncertain harvest; keep us here
337,CONTENTS,All simply in the springing of the year.
338,CONTENTS,"Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,"
339,CONTENTS,"Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;"
340,CONTENTS,"And make us happy in the happy bees,"
341,CONTENTS,The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.
342,CONTENTS,And make us happy in the darting bird
343,CONTENTS,"That suddenly above the bees is heard,"
344,CONTENTS,"The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,"
345,CONTENTS,And off a blossom in mid air stands still.
346,CONTENTS,"For this is love and nothing else is love,"
347,CONTENTS,The which it is reserved for God above
348,CONTENTS,"To sanctify to what far ends He will,"
349,CONTENTS,But which it only needs that we fulfil.
350,CONTENTS,
351,CONTENTS,
352,CONTENTS,
353,CONTENTS,
354,CONTENTS,Flower-gathering
355,CONTENTS,
356,CONTENTS,"I LEFT you in the morning,"
357,CONTENTS,"And in the morning glow,"
358,CONTENTS,You walked a way beside me
359,CONTENTS,To make me sad to go.
360,CONTENTS,"Do you know me in the gloaming,"
361,CONTENTS,Gaunt and dusty grey with roaming?
362,CONTENTS,"Are you dumb because you know me not,"
363,CONTENTS,Or dumb because you know?
364,CONTENTS,All for me? And not a question
365,CONTENTS,For the faded flowers gay
366,CONTENTS,That could take me from beside you
367,CONTENTS,For the ages of a day?
368,CONTENTS,"They are yours, and be the measure"
369,CONTENTS,"Of their worth for you to treasure,"
370,CONTENTS,The measure of the little while
371,CONTENTS,That I've been long away.
372,CONTENTS,
373,CONTENTS,
374,CONTENTS,
375,CONTENTS,
376,CONTENTS,Rose Pogonias
377,CONTENTS,
378,CONTENTS,"A SATURATED meadow,"
379,CONTENTS,"Sun-shaped and jewel-small,"
380,CONTENTS,A circle scarcely wider
381,CONTENTS,Than the trees around were tall;
382,CONTENTS,"Where winds were quite excluded,"
383,CONTENTS,And the air was stifling sweet
384,CONTENTS,"With the breath of many flowers,--"
385,CONTENTS,A temple of the heat.
386,CONTENTS,"There we bowed us in the burning,"
387,CONTENTS,"As the sun's right worship is,"
388,CONTENTS,To pick where none could miss them
389,CONTENTS,A thousand orchises;
390,CONTENTS,"For though the grass was scattered,"
391,CONTENTS,Yet every second spear
392,CONTENTS,"Seemed tipped with wings of color,"
393,CONTENTS,That tinged the atmosphere.
394,CONTENTS,We raised a simple prayer
395,CONTENTS,"Before we left the spot,"
396,CONTENTS,That in the general mowing
397,CONTENTS,That place might be forgot;
398,CONTENTS,"Or if not all so favoured,"
399,CONTENTS,"Obtain such grace of hours,"
400,CONTENTS,That none should mow the grass there
401,CONTENTS,While so confused with flowers.
402,CONTENTS,
403,CONTENTS,
404,CONTENTS,
405,CONTENTS,
406,CONTENTS,Asking for Roses
407,CONTENTS,
408,CONTENTS,"A HOUSE that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,"
409,CONTENTS,"With doors that none but the wind ever closes,"
410,CONTENTS,Its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;
411,CONTENTS,It stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses.
412,CONTENTS,I pass by that way in the gloaming with Mary;
413,CONTENTS,"'I wonder,' I say, 'who the owner of those is."
414,CONTENTS,"'Oh, no one you know,' she answers me airy,"
415,CONTENTS,'But one we must ask if we want any roses.'
416,CONTENTS,So we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
417,CONTENTS,"There in the hush of the wood that reposes,"
418,CONTENTS,"And turn and go up to the open door boldly,"
419,CONTENTS,And knock to the echoes as beggars for roses.
420,CONTENTS,"'Pray, are you within there, Mistress Who-were-you?'"
421,CONTENTS,'Tis Mary that speaks and our errand discloses.
422,CONTENTS,"'Pray, are you within there? Bestir you, bestir you!"
423,CONTENTS,'Tis summer again; there's two come for roses.
424,CONTENTS,"'A word with you, that of the singer recalling--"
425,CONTENTS,Old Herrick: a saying that every maid knows is
426,CONTENTS,"A flower unplucked is but left to the falling,"
427,CONTENTS,And nothing is gained by not gathering roses.'
428,CONTENTS,We do not loosen our hands' intertwining
429,CONTENTS,"(Not caring so very much what she supposes),"
430,CONTENTS,There when she comes on us mistily shining
431,CONTENTS,And grants us by silence the boon of her roses.
432,CONTENTS,
433,CONTENTS,
434,CONTENTS,
435,CONTENTS,
436,CONTENTS,Waiting Afield at Dusk
437,CONTENTS,
438,CONTENTS,"WHAT things for dream there are when spectre-like,"
439,CONTENTS,"Moving among tall haycocks lightly piled,"
440,CONTENTS,"I enter alone upon the stubble field,"
441,CONTENTS,"From which the laborers' voices late have died,"
442,CONTENTS,And in the antiphony of afterglow
443,CONTENTS,"And rising full moon, sit me down"
444,CONTENTS,Upon the full moon's side of the first haycock
445,CONTENTS,And lose myself amid so many alike.
446,CONTENTS,"I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour,"
447,CONTENTS,Preventing shadow until the moon prevail;
448,CONTENTS,"I dream upon the night-hawks peopling heaven,"
449,CONTENTS,"Each circling each with vague unearthly cry,"
450,CONTENTS,Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar;
451,CONTENTS,"And on the bat's mute antics, who would seem"
452,CONTENTS,"Dimly to have made out my secret place,"
453,CONTENTS,"Only to lose it when he pirouettes,"
454,CONTENTS,And seek it endlessly with purblind haste;
455,CONTENTS,On the last swallow's sweep; and on the rasp
456,CONTENTS,"In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back,"
457,CONTENTS,"That, silenced by my advent, finds once more,"
458,CONTENTS,"After an interval, his instrument,"
459,CONTENTS,And tries once--twice--and thrice if I be there;
460,CONTENTS,And on the worn book of old-golden song
461,CONTENTS,"I brought not here to read, it seems, but hold"
462,CONTENTS,And freshen in this air of withering sweetness;
463,CONTENTS,"But on the memory of one absent most,"
464,CONTENTS,For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye.
465,CONTENTS,
466,CONTENTS,
467,CONTENTS,
468,CONTENTS,
469,CONTENTS,In a Vale
470,CONTENTS,
471,CONTENTS,"WHEN I was young, we dwelt in a vale"
472,CONTENTS,"By a misty fen that rang all night,"
473,CONTENTS,And thus it was the maidens pale
474,CONTENTS,"I knew so well, whose garments trail"
475,CONTENTS,Across the reeds to a window light.
476,CONTENTS,"The fen had every kind of bloom,"
477,CONTENTS,"And for every kind there was a face,"
478,CONTENTS,And a voice that has sounded in my room
479,CONTENTS,Across the sill from the outer gloom.
480,CONTENTS,"Each came singly unto her place,"
481,CONTENTS,But all came every night with the mist;
482,CONTENTS,And often they brought so much to say
483,CONTENTS,"Of things of moment to which, they wist,"
484,CONTENTS,"One so lonely was fain to list,"
485,CONTENTS,That the stars were almost faded away
486,CONTENTS,"Before the last went, heavy with dew,"
487,CONTENTS,Back to the place from which she came--
488,CONTENTS,"Where the bird was before it flew,"
489,CONTENTS,"Where the flower was before it grew,"
490,CONTENTS,Where bird and flower were one and the same.
491,CONTENTS,And thus it is I know so well
492,CONTENTS,"Why the flower has odor, the bird has song."
493,CONTENTS,"You have only to ask me, and I can tell."
494,CONTENTS,"No, not vainly there did I dwell,"
495,CONTENTS,Nor vainly listen all the night long.
496,CONTENTS,
497,CONTENTS,
498,CONTENTS,
499,CONTENTS,
500,CONTENTS,A Dream Pang
501,CONTENTS,
502,CONTENTS,"I HAD withdrawn in forest, and my song"
503,CONTENTS,Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
504,CONTENTS,And to the forest edge you came one day
505,CONTENTS,"(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,"
506,CONTENTS,"But did not enter, though the wish was strong:"
507,CONTENTS,"You shook your pensive head as who should say,"
508,CONTENTS,'I dare not--too far in his footsteps stray--
509,CONTENTS,He must seek me would he undo the wrong.
510,CONTENTS,"Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all"
511,CONTENTS,Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
512,CONTENTS,And the sweet pang it cost me not to call
513,CONTENTS,And tell you that I saw does still abide.
514,CONTENTS,"But 'tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,"
515,CONTENTS,"For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof."
516,CONTENTS,
517,CONTENTS,
518,CONTENTS,
519,CONTENTS,
520,CONTENTS,In Neglect
521,CONTENTS,
522,CONTENTS,"THEY leave us so to the way we took,"
523,CONTENTS,"As two in whom they were proved mistaken,"
524,CONTENTS,"That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook,"
525,CONTENTS,"With mischievous, vagrant, seraphic look,"
526,CONTENTS,And try if we cannot feel forsaken.
527,CONTENTS,
528,CONTENTS,
529,CONTENTS,
530,CONTENTS,
531,CONTENTS,The Vantage Point
532,CONTENTS,
533,CONTENTS,"IF tired of trees I seek again mankind,"
534,CONTENTS,"Well I know where to hie me--in the dawn,"
535,CONTENTS,To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn.
536,CONTENTS,"There amid lolling juniper reclined,"
537,CONTENTS,"Myself unseen, I see in white defined"
538,CONTENTS,"Far off the homes of men, and farther still,"
539,CONTENTS,"The graves of men on an opposing hill,"

543,CONTENTS,"The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow,"
544,CONTENTS,"My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze,"
545,CONTENTS,"I smell the earth, I smell the bruisèd plant,"
546,CONTENTS,I look into the crater of the ant.

551,CONTENTS,Mowing
552,CONTENTS,
553,CONTENTS,"THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one,"
554,CONTENTS,And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
555,CONTENTS,What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;
556,CONTENTS,"Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,"
557,CONTENTS,"Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--"
558,CONTENTS,And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
559,CONTENTS,"It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,"
560,CONTENTS,Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:
561,CONTENTS,Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
562,CONTENTS,"To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,"
563,CONTENTS,Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
564,CONTENTS,"(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake."
565,CONTENTS,The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.
566,CONTENTS,My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.

571,CONTENTS,Going for Water
572,CONTENTS,
573,CONTENTS,"THE well was dry beside the door,"
574,CONTENTS,And so we went with pail and can
575,CONTENTS,Across the fields behind the house
576,CONTENTS,To seek the brook if still it ran;
577,CONTENTS,"Not loth to have excuse to go,"
578,CONTENTS,Because the autumn eve was fair
579,CONTENTS,"(Though chill), because the fields were ours,"
580,CONTENTS,And by the brook our woods were there.
581,CONTENTS,We ran as if to meet the moon
582,CONTENTS,"That slowly dawned behind the trees,"
583,CONTENTS,"The barren boughs without the leaves,"
584,CONTENTS,"Without the birds, without the breeze."
585,CONTENTS,"But once within the wood, we paused"
586,CONTENTS,"Like gnomes that hid us from the moon,"
587,CONTENTS,Ready to run to hiding new
588,CONTENTS,With laughter when she found us soon.
589,CONTENTS,Each laid on other a staying hand
590,CONTENTS,"To listen ere we dared to look,"
591,CONTENTS,And in the hush we joined to make
592,CONTENTS,"We heard, we knew we heard the brook."
593,CONTENTS,"A note as from a single place,"
594,CONTENTS,A slender tinkling fall that made
595,CONTENTS,Now drops that floated on the pool
596,CONTENTS,"Like pearls, and now a silver blade."

607,CONTENTS,'Tis pity if the case require

611,CONTENTS,"But so with all, from babes that play"

622,CONTENTS,Shall not dissemble their surprise
623,CONTENTS,"On waking to find valor reign,"
624,CONTENTS,"Even as on earth, in paradise;"
625,CONTENTS,And where they sought without the sword
626,CONTENTS,"Wide fields of asphodel fore'er,"
627,CONTENTS,To find that the utmost reward
628,CONTENTS,Of daring should be still to dare.
629,CONTENTS,The light of heaven falls whole and white
630,CONTENTS,"And is not shattered into dyes,"
631,CONTENTS,The light for ever is morning light;
632,CONTENTS,The hills are verdured pasture-wise;
633,CONTENTS,"The angel hosts with freshness go,"
634,CONTENTS,And seek with laughter what to brave;--
635,CONTENTS,And binding all is the hushed snow
636,CONTENTS,Of the far-distant breaking wave.
637,CONTENTS,And from a cliff-top is proclaimed
638,CONTENTS,"The gathering of the souls for birth,"
639,CONTENTS,"The trial by existence named,"
640,CONTENTS,The obscuration upon earth.
641,CONTENTS,And the slant spirits trooping by
642,CONTENTS,In streams and cross- and counter-streams
643,CONTENTS,Can but give ear to that sweet cry
644,CONTENTS,For its suggestion of what dreams!
645,CONTENTS,And the more loitering are turned
646,CONTENTS,To view once more the sacrifice
647,CONTENTS,Of those who for some good discerned
648,CONTENTS,Will gladly give up paradise.
649,CONTENTS,And a white shimmering concourse rolls
650,CONTENTS,Toward the throne to witness there
651,CONTENTS,The speeding of devoted souls
652,CONTENTS,Which God makes his especial care.
653,CONTENTS,"And none are taken but who will,"
654,CONTENTS,Having first heard the life read out
655,CONTENTS,"That opens earthward, good and ill,"
656,CONTENTS,Beyond the shadow of a doubt;
657,CONTENTS,"And very beautifully God limns,"
658,CONTENTS,"And tenderly, life's little dream,"
659,CONTENTS,"But naught extenuates or dims,"
660,CONTENTS,Setting the thing that is supreme.
661,CONTENTS,Nor is there wanting in the press
662,CONTENTS,"Some spirit to stand simply forth,"
663,CONTENTS,"Heroic in its nakedness,"
664,CONTENTS,Against the uttermost of earth.
665,CONTENTS,The tale of earth's unhonored things
666,CONTENTS,Sounds nobler there than 'neath the sun;
667,CONTENTS,"And the mind whirls and the heart sings,"
668,CONTENTS,And a shout greets the daring one.
669,CONTENTS,But always God speaks at the end:
670,CONTENTS,'One thought in agony of strife
671,CONTENTS,"The bravest would have by for friend,"
672,CONTENTS,The memory that he chose the life;
673,CONTENTS,But the pure fate to which you go
674,CONTENTS,"Admits no memory of choice,"
675,CONTENTS,Or the woe were not earthly woe
676,CONTENTS,To which you give the assenting voice.'
677,CONTENTS,"And so the choice must be again,"
678,CONTENTS,But the last choice is still the same;
679,CONTENTS,"And the awe passes wonder then,"
680,CONTENTS,And a hush falls for all acclaim.
681,CONTENTS,And God has taken a flower of gold
682,CONTENTS,"And broken it, and used therefrom"
683,CONTENTS,The mystic link to bind and hold
684,CONTENTS,Spirit to matter till death come.
685,CONTENTS,"'Tis of the essence of life here,"
686,CONTENTS,"Though we choose greatly, still to lack"
687,CONTENTS,"The lasting memory at all clear,"
688,CONTENTS,That life has for us on the wrack
689,CONTENTS,Nothing but what we somehow chose;
690,CONTENTS,Thus are we wholly stripped of pride
691,CONTENTS,"In the pain that has but one close,"
692,CONTENTS,Bearing it crushed and mystified.

694,CONTENTS,
695,CONTENTS,

697,CONTENTS,In Equal Sacrifice
698,CONTENTS,
699,CONTENTS,THUS of old the Douglas did:
700,CONTENTS,He left his land as he was bid
701,CONTENTS,With the royal heart of Robert the Bruce
702,CONTENTS,"In a golden case with a golden lid,"
703,CONTENTS,To carry the same to the Holy Land;
704,CONTENTS,By which we see and understand
705,CONTENTS,That that was the place to carry a heart
706,CONTENTS,"At loyalty and love's command,"
707,CONTENTS,And that was the case to carry it in.
708,CONTENTS,The Douglas had not far to win
709,CONTENTS,"Before he came to the land of Spain,"
710,CONTENTS,Where long a holy war had been
711,CONTENTS,Against the too-victorious Moor;
712,CONTENTS,And there his courage could not endure
713,CONTENTS,Not to strike a blow for God
714,CONTENTS,Before he made his errand sure.
715,CONTENTS,"And ever it was intended so,"
716,CONTENTS,"That a man for God should strike a blow,"
717,CONTENTS,No matter the heart he has in charge
718,CONTENTS,For the Holy Land where hearts should go.
719,CONTENTS,"But when in battle the foe were met,"
720,CONTENTS,"The Douglas found him sore beset,"
721,CONTENTS,With only strength of the fighting arm
722,CONTENTS,For one more battle passage yet--
723,CONTENTS,And that as vain to save the day
724,CONTENTS,As bring his body safe away--
725,CONTENTS,Only a signal deed to do
726,CONTENTS,And a last sounding word to say.
727,CONTENTS,The heart he wore in a golden chain
728,CONTENTS,"He swung and flung forth into the plain,"
729,CONTENTS,And followed it crying 'Heart or death!'
730,CONTENTS,And fighting over it perished fain.
731,CONTENTS,"So may another do of right,"
732,CONTENTS,"Give a heart to the hopeless fight,"
733,CONTENTS,The more of right the more he loves;
734,CONTENTS,So may another redouble might
735,CONTENTS,"For a few swift gleams of the angry brand,"
736,CONTENTS,Scorning greatly not to demand
737,CONTENTS,In equal sacrifice with his
738,CONTENTS,The heart he bore to the Holy Land.

743,CONTENTS,The Tuft of Flowers
744,CONTENTS,
745,CONTENTS,I WENT to turn the grass once after one
746,CONTENTS,Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.
747,CONTENTS,The dew was gone that made his blade so keen
748,CONTENTS,Before I came to view the leveled scene.
749,CONTENTS,I looked for him behind an isle of trees;
750,CONTENTS,I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.
751,CONTENTS,"But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,"
752,CONTENTS,"And I must be, as he had been,--alone,"
753,CONTENTS,"'As all must be,' I said within my heart,"
754,CONTENTS,'Whether they work together or apart.'
755,CONTENTS,"But as I said it, swift there passed me by"
756,CONTENTS,"On noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly,"
757,CONTENTS,Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night
758,CONTENTS,Some resting flower of yesterday's delight.
759,CONTENTS,"And once I marked his flight go round and round,"
760,CONTENTS,As where some flower lay withering on the ground.
761,CONTENTS,"And then he flew as far as eye could see,"
762,CONTENTS,And then on tremulous wing came back to me.
763,CONTENTS,"I thought of questions that have no reply,"
764,CONTENTS,And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;
765,CONTENTS,"But he turned first, and led my eye to look"
766,CONTENTS,"At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,"
767,CONTENTS,A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
768,CONTENTS,Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.
769,CONTENTS,"I left my place to know them by their name,"
770,CONTENTS,Finding them butterfly weed when I came.
771,CONTENTS,"The mower in the dew had loved them thus,"
772,CONTENTS,"By leaving them to flourish, not for us,"
773,CONTENTS,Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him.
774,CONTENTS,But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.
775,CONTENTS,"The butterfly and I had lit upon,"
776,CONTENTS,"Nevertheless, a message from the dawn,"
777,CONTENTS,"That made me hear the wakening birds around,"
778,CONTENTS,"And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,"
779,CONTENTS,And feel a spirit kindred to my own;
780,CONTENTS,So that henceforth I worked no more alone;
781,CONTENTS,"But glad with him, I worked as with his aid,"
782,CONTENTS,"And weary, sought at noon with him the shade;"
783,CONTENTS,"And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech"
784,CONTENTS,With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.
785,CONTENTS,"'Men work together,' I told him from the heart,"
786,CONTENTS,'Whether they work together or apart.'

793,CONTENTS,TWO fairies it was
794,CONTENTS,On a still summer day
795,CONTENTS,Came forth in the woods
796,CONTENTS,With the flowers to play.
797,CONTENTS,The flowers they plucked
798,CONTENTS,They cast on the ground
799,CONTENTS,"For others, and those"
800,CONTENTS,For still others they found.
801,CONTENTS,Flower-guided it was
802,CONTENTS,That they came as they ran
803,CONTENTS,On something that lay
804,CONTENTS,In the shape of a man.
805,CONTENTS,The snow must have made
806,CONTENTS,The feathery bed
807,CONTENTS,When this one fell
808,CONTENTS,On the sleep of the dead.
809,CONTENTS,But the snow was gone
810,CONTENTS,"A long time ago,"
811,CONTENTS,And the body he wore
812,CONTENTS,Nigh gone with the snow.
813,CONTENTS,The fairies drew near
814,CONTENTS,And keenly espied
815,CONTENTS,A ring on his hand
816,CONTENTS,And a chain at his side.
817,CONTENTS,They knelt in the leaves
818,CONTENTS,And eerily played
819,CONTENTS,"With the glittering things,"
820,CONTENTS,And were not afraid.
821,CONTENTS,And when they went home
822,CONTENTS,"To hide in their burrow,"
823,CONTENTS,They took them along
824,CONTENTS,To play with to-morrow.
825,CONTENTS,"When you came on death,"
826,CONTENTS,Did you not come flower-guided
827,CONTENTS,Like the elves in the wood?
828,CONTENTS,I remember that I did.
829,CONTENTS,But I recognised death
830,CONTENTS,"With sorrow and dread,"
831,CONTENTS,And I hated and hate
832,CONTENTS,The spoils of the dead.

840,CONTENTS,"His skin and his hair and his eyes were gray,"
841,CONTENTS,"The gray of the moss of walls were they,--"
842,CONTENTS,And stood in the sun and looked his fill
843,CONTENTS,At wooded valley and wooded hill.
844,CONTENTS,"He stood in the zephyr, pipes in hand,"
845,CONTENTS,On a height of naked pasture land;
846,CONTENTS,In all the country he did command
847,CONTENTS,He saw no smoke and he saw no roof.
848,CONTENTS,That was well! and he stamped a hoof.
849,CONTENTS,"His heart knew peace, for none came here"
850,CONTENTS,To this lean feeding save once a year
851,CONTENTS,"Someone to salt the half-wild steer,"
852,CONTENTS,Or homespun children with clicking pails
853,CONTENTS,Who see no little they tell no tales.
854,CONTENTS,"He tossed his pipes, too hard to teach"
855,CONTENTS,"A new-world song, far out of reach,"
856,CONTENTS,For a sylvan sign that the blue jay's screech
857,CONTENTS,And the whimper of hawks beside the sun
858,CONTENTS,"Were music enough for him, for one."
859,CONTENTS,Times were changed from what they were:
860,CONTENTS,Such pipes kept less of power to stir
861,CONTENTS,The fruited bough of the juniper
862,CONTENTS,And the fragile bluets clustered there
863,CONTENTS,Than the merest aimless breath of air.
864,CONTENTS,"They were pipes of pagan mirth,"
865,CONTENTS,And the world had found new terms of worth.
866,CONTENTS,He laid him down on the sun-burned earth
867,CONTENTS,And ravelled a flower and looked away--
868,CONTENTS,Play? Play?--What should he play?

874,CONTENTS,
875,CONTENTS,IT was far in the sameness of the wood;
876,CONTENTS,"I was running with joy on the Demon's trail,"
877,CONTENTS,Though I knew what I hunted was no true god.
878,CONTENTS,It was just as the light was beginning to fail
879,CONTENTS,That I suddenly heard--all I needed to hear:
880,CONTENTS,It has lasted me many and many a year.
881,CONTENTS,"The sound was behind me instead of before,"
882,CONTENTS,"A sleepy sound, but mocking half,"
883,CONTENTS,As of one who utterly couldn't care.
884,CONTENTS,"The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh,"
885,CONTENTS,Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went;
886,CONTENTS,And well I knew what the Demon meant.
887,CONTENTS,I shall not forget how his laugh rang out.
888,CONTENTS,"I felt as a fool to have been so caught,"
889,CONTENTS,And checked my steps to make pretence
890,CONTENTS,It was something among the leaves I sought
891,CONTENTS,(Though doubtful whether he stayed to see).
892,CONTENTS,Thereafter I sat me against a tree.

902,CONTENTS,Be it my loss.
903,CONTENTS,"It will be long ere the marshes resume,"

919,CONTENTS,Expend their bloom in vain.
920,CONTENTS,"Come over the hills and far with me,"
921,CONTENTS,And be my love in the rain.
922,CONTENTS,The birds have less to say for themselves
923,CONTENTS,In the wood-world's torn despair
924,CONTENTS,"Than now these numberless years the elves,"
925,CONTENTS,Although they are no less there:
926,CONTENTS,All song of the woods is crushed like some
927,CONTENTS,"Wild, easily shattered rose."
928,CONTENTS,"Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,"
929,CONTENTS,Where the boughs rain when it blows.
930,CONTENTS,There is the gale to urge behind
931,CONTENTS,"And bruit our singing down,"
932,CONTENTS,And the shallow waters aflutter with wind
933,CONTENTS,From which to gather your gown.
934,CONTENTS,"What matter if we go clear to the west,"
935,CONTENTS,And come not through dry-shod?
936,CONTENTS,For wilding brooch shall wet your breast
937,CONTENTS,The rain-fresh goldenrod.
938,CONTENTS,"Oh, never this whelming east wind swells"
939,CONTENTS,But it seems like the sea's return
940,CONTENTS,To the ancient lands where it left the shells
941,CONTENTS,Before the age of the fern;
942,CONTENTS,And it seems like the time when after doubt
943,CONTENTS,Our love came back amain.

964,CONTENTS,At noon release another leaf;
965,CONTENTS,"One from our trees, one far away;"
966,CONTENTS,Retard the sun with gentle mist;

983,CONTENTS,(Nor is it sad to thee!)
984,CONTENTS,Save only me
985,CONTENTS,There is none left to mourn thee in the fields.
986,CONTENTS,The gray grass is not dappled with the snow;
987,CONTENTS,Its two banks have not shut upon the river;
988,CONTENTS,But it is long ago--
989,CONTENTS,It seems forever--
990,CONTENTS,"Since first I saw thee glance,"
991,CONTENTS,"With all the dazzling other ones,"
992,CONTENTS,"In airy dalliance,"
993,CONTENTS,"Precipitate in love,"
994,CONTENTS,"Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,"
995,CONTENTS,Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.
996,CONTENTS,"When that was, the soft mist"
997,CONTENTS,"Of my regret hung not on all the land,"

1002,CONTENTS,"With those great careless wings,"
1003,CONTENTS,Nor yet did I.
1004,CONTENTS,And there were other things:
1005,CONTENTS,It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp:
1006,CONTENTS,Then fearful he had let thee win
1007,CONTENTS,"Too far beyond him to be gathered in,"
1008,CONTENTS,"Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp."
1009,CONTENTS,Ah! I remember me
1010,CONTENTS,How once conspiracy was rife
1011,CONTENTS,Against my life--
1012,CONTENTS,The languor of it and the dreaming fond;
1013,CONTENTS,"Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,"
1014,CONTENTS,"The breeze three odors brought,"
1015,CONTENTS,And a gem-flower waved in a wand!
1016,CONTENTS,Then when I was distraught
1017,CONTENTS,"And could not speak,"
1018,CONTENTS,"Sidelong, full on my cheek,"
1019,CONTENTS,What should that reckless zephyr fling
1020,CONTENTS,But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!
1021,CONTENTS,I found that wing broken to-day!
1022,CONTENTS,"For thou are dead, I said,"
1023,CONTENTS,And the strange birds say.
1024,CONTENTS,I found it with the withered leaves

1044,CONTENTS,"And the dead leaves lie huddled and still,"
1045,CONTENTS,No longer blown hither and thither;
1046,CONTENTS,The last lone aster is gone;
