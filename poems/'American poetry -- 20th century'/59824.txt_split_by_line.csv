121,THE PASTURE,
122,THE PASTURE,
123,THE PASTURE,I'm going out to clean the pasture spring;
124,THE PASTURE,I'll only stop to rake the leaves away
125,THE PASTURE,"(And wait to watch the water clear, I may):"
126,THE PASTURE,I shan't be gone long.—-You come too.
127,THE PASTURE,
128,THE PASTURE,I'm going out to fetch the little calf
129,THE PASTURE,"That's standing by the mother. It's so young,"
130,THE PASTURE,It totters when she licks it with her tongue.
131,THE PASTURE,I shan't be gone long.—-You come too.

137,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,
138,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,
139,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,Something inspires the only cow of late
140,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,"To make no more of a wall than an open gate,"
141,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,And think no more of wall-builders than fools.
142,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
143,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,"A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,"
144,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,She scorns a pasture withering to the root.
145,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten
146,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.
147,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.
148,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,She bellows on a knoll against the sky.
149,THE COW IN APPLE-TIME,Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.

154,THE RUNAWAY,
155,THE RUNAWAY,
156,THE RUNAWAY,Once when the snow of the year was beginning to
157,THE RUNAWAY,"fall,"
158,THE RUNAWAY,"We stopped by a mountain pasture to say ""Whose"
159,THE RUNAWAY,"colt?"""
160,THE RUNAWAY,"A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,"
161,THE RUNAWAY,The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head
162,THE RUNAWAY,And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.
163,THE RUNAWAY,"We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,"
164,THE RUNAWAY,"And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and"
165,THE RUNAWAY,"grey,"
166,THE RUNAWAY,Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.
167,THE RUNAWAY,"""I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow."
168,THE RUNAWAY,He isn't winter-broken. It isn't play
169,THE RUNAWAY,With the little fellow at all. He's running away.
170,THE RUNAWAY,"I doubt if even his mother could tell him, 'Sakes,"
171,THE RUNAWAY,It's only weather.' He'd think she didn't know!
172,THE RUNAWAY,"Where is his mother? He can't be out alone."""
173,THE RUNAWAY,And now he comes again with a clatter of stone
174,THE RUNAWAY,And mounts the wall again with whited eyes
175,THE RUNAWAY,And all his tail that isn't hair up straight.
176,THE RUNAWAY,He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.
177,THE RUNAWAY,"""Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,"
178,THE RUNAWAY,"When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,"
179,THE RUNAWAY,"Ought to be told to come and take him in."""

189,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,
190,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,
191,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,All out of doors looked darkly in at him
192,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,"
193,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
194,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
195,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
196,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,What kept him from remembering what it was
197,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,That brought him to that creaking room was age.
198,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,He stood with barrels round him—-at a loss.
199,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,And having scared the cellar under him
200,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"In clomping there, he scared it once again"
201,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"In clomping off;—-and scared the outer night,"
202,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
203,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Of trees and crack of branches, common things,"
204,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,But nothing so like beating on a box.
205,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,A light he was to no one but himself
206,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
207,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"A quiet light, and then not even that."
208,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"He consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
209,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"So late-arising, to the broken moon"
210,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,As better than the sun in any case
211,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
212,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,His icicles along the wall to keep;
213,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt
214,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,"
215,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept."
216,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"One aged man—-one man—-can't keep a house,"
217,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"A farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
218,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,It's thus he does it of a winter night.

224,HOME BURIAL,
225,HOME BURIAL,
226,HOME BURIAL,He saw her from the bottom of the stairs
227,HOME BURIAL,"Before she saw him. She was starting down,"
228,HOME BURIAL,Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.
229,HOME BURIAL,She took a doubtful step and then undid it
230,HOME BURIAL,To raise herself and look again. He spoke
231,HOME BURIAL,"Advancing toward her: ""What is it you see"
232,HOME BURIAL,"From up there always—-for I want to know."""
233,HOME BURIAL,"She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,"
234,HOME BURIAL,And her face changed from terrified to dull.
235,HOME BURIAL,"He said to gain time: ""What is it you see?"""
236,HOME BURIAL,Mounting until she cowered under him.
237,HOME BURIAL,"""I will find out now—you must tell me, dear."""
238,HOME BURIAL,"She, in her place, refused him any help"
239,HOME BURIAL,With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.
240,HOME BURIAL,"She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,"
241,HOME BURIAL,Blind creature; and a while he didn't see.
242,HOME BURIAL,"But at last he murmured, ""Oh,"" and again, ""Oh."""
243,HOME BURIAL,
244,HOME BURIAL,"""What is it—what?"" she said."
245,HOME BURIAL,"""Just that I see."""
246,HOME BURIAL,
247,HOME BURIAL,"""You don't,"" she challenged. ""Tell me what it is."""
248,HOME BURIAL,
249,HOME BURIAL,"""The wonder is I didn't see at once."
250,HOME BURIAL,I never noticed it from here before.
251,HOME BURIAL,I must be wonted to it—-that's the reason.
252,HOME BURIAL,The little graveyard where my people are!
253,HOME BURIAL,So small the window frames the whole of it.
254,HOME BURIAL,"Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?"
255,HOME BURIAL,"There are three stones of slate and one of marble,"
256,HOME BURIAL,Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
257,HOME BURIAL,On the sidehill. We haven't to mind _those._
258,HOME BURIAL,"But I understand: it is not the stones,"
259,HOME BURIAL,"But the child's mound----"""
260,HOME BURIAL,
261,HOME BURIAL,"Don't, don't, don't, don't,"" she cried."
262,HOME BURIAL,
263,HOME BURIAL,She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
264,HOME BURIAL,"That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;"
265,HOME BURIAL,"And turned on him with such a daunting look,"
266,HOME BURIAL,He said twice over before he knew himself:
267,HOME BURIAL,"""Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?"""
268,HOME BURIAL,
269,HOME BURIAL,"""Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't"
270,HOME BURIAL,need it!
271,HOME BURIAL,I must get out of here. I must get air.
272,HOME BURIAL,"I don't know rightly whether any man can."""
273,HOME BURIAL,
274,HOME BURIAL,"""Amy! Don't go to someone else this time."
275,HOME BURIAL,"Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs."""
276,HOME BURIAL,He sat and fixed his chin between his fists.
277,HOME BURIAL,"""There's something I should like to ask you, dear."""
278,HOME BURIAL,
279,HOME BURIAL,"""You don't know how to ask it."""
280,HOME BURIAL,
281,HOME BURIAL,"""Help me, then."""
282,HOME BURIAL,
283,HOME BURIAL,Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.
284,HOME BURIAL,
285,HOME BURIAL,"""My words are nearly always an offence."
286,HOME BURIAL,I don't know how to speak of anything
287,HOME BURIAL,So as to please you. But I might be taught
288,HOME BURIAL,I should suppose. I can't say I see how.
289,HOME BURIAL,A man must partly give up being a man
290,HOME BURIAL,With women-folk. We could have some
291,HOME BURIAL,arrangement
292,HOME BURIAL,By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off
293,HOME BURIAL,Anything special you're a-mind to name.
294,HOME BURIAL,Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that
295,HOME BURIAL,love.
296,HOME BURIAL,Two that don't love can't live together without
297,HOME BURIAL,them.
298,HOME BURIAL,"But two that do can't live together with them."""
299,HOME BURIAL,"She moved the latch a little. ""Don't—-don't go."
300,HOME BURIAL,Don't carry it to someone else this time.
301,HOME BURIAL,Tell me about it if it's something human.
302,HOME BURIAL,Let me into your grief. I'm not so much
303,HOME BURIAL,Unlike other folks as your standing there
304,HOME BURIAL,Apart would make me out. Give me my chance.
305,HOME BURIAL,"I do think, though, you overdo it a little."
306,HOME BURIAL,What was it brought you up to think it the thing
307,HOME BURIAL,To take your mother-loss of a first child
308,HOME BURIAL,So inconsolably—in the face of love.
309,HOME BURIAL,"You'd think his memory might be satisfied----"""
310,HOME BURIAL,
311,HOME BURIAL,"""There you go sneering now!"""
312,HOME BURIAL,
313,HOME BURIAL,"""I'm not, I'm not!"
314,HOME BURIAL,You make me angry. I'll come down to you.
315,HOME BURIAL,"God, what a woman! And it's come to this,"
316,HOME BURIAL,"A man can't speak of his own child that's dead."""
317,HOME BURIAL,"""You can't because you don't know how."
318,HOME BURIAL,"If you had any feelings, you that dug"
319,HOME BURIAL,With your own hand—-how could you?—-his little
320,HOME BURIAL,grave;
321,HOME BURIAL,"I saw you from that very window there,"
322,HOME BURIAL,"Making the gravel leap and leap in air,"
323,HOME BURIAL,"Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly"
324,HOME BURIAL,And roll back down the mound beside the hole.
325,HOME BURIAL,"I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you."
326,HOME BURIAL,And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
327,HOME BURIAL,"To look again, and still your spade kept lifting."
328,HOME BURIAL,Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice
329,HOME BURIAL,"Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why,"
330,HOME BURIAL,But I went near to see with my own eyes.
331,HOME BURIAL,You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
332,HOME BURIAL,Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave
333,HOME BURIAL,And talk about your everyday concerns.
334,HOME BURIAL,You had stood the spade up against the wall
335,HOME BURIAL,"Outside there in the entry, for I saw it."""
336,HOME BURIAL,
337,HOME BURIAL,"""I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed."
338,HOME BURIAL,"I'm cursed. God, if I don't believe I'm cursed."""
339,HOME BURIAL,"""I can repeat the very words you were saying."
340,HOME BURIAL,
341,HOME BURIAL,'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
342,HOME BURIAL,Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.'
343,HOME BURIAL,"Think of it, talk like that at such a time!"
344,HOME BURIAL,What had how long it takes a birch to rot
345,HOME BURIAL,To do with what was in the darkened parlour?
346,HOME BURIAL,You _couldn't_ care! The nearest friends can go
347,HOME BURIAL,"With anyone to death, comes so far short"
348,HOME BURIAL,They might as well not try to go at all.
349,HOME BURIAL,"No, from the time when one is sick to death,"
350,HOME BURIAL,"One is alone, and he dies more alone."
351,HOME BURIAL,"Friends make pretence of following to the grave,"
352,HOME BURIAL,"But before one is in it, their minds are turned"
353,HOME BURIAL,And making the best of their way back to life
354,HOME BURIAL,"And living people, and things they understand."
355,HOME BURIAL,But the world's evil. I won't have grief so
356,HOME BURIAL,"If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!"""
357,HOME BURIAL,
358,HOME BURIAL,"""There, you have said it all and you feel better."
359,HOME BURIAL,You won't go now. You're crying. Close the door.
360,HOME BURIAL,The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up?
361,HOME BURIAL,"Amy! There's someone coming down the road!"""
362,HOME BURIAL,
363,HOME BURIAL,"""_You_-—oh, you think the talk is all. I must go—-"
364,HOME BURIAL,Somewhere out of this house. How can I make
365,HOME BURIAL,"you----"""
366,HOME BURIAL,
367,HOME BURIAL,"""If—-you—-do!"" She was opening the door wider."
368,HOME BURIAL,"""Where do you mean to go? First tell me that."
369,HOME BURIAL,"I'll follow and bring you back by force. I _will!_—-"""

376,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
377,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
378,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,"
379,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
380,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To meet him in the doorway with the news
381,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And put him on his guard. ""Silas is back."""
382,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
383,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,She pushed him outward with her through the door
384,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And shut it after her. ""Be kind,"" she said."
385,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,She took the market things from Warren's arms
386,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And set them on the porch, then drew him down"
387,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To sit beside her on the wooden steps.
388,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
389,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""When was I ever anything but kind to him?"
390,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"But I'll not have the fellow back,"" he said."
391,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I told him so last haying, didn't I?"
392,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'"
393,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,What good is he? Who else will harbour him
394,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,At his age for the little he can do?
395,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,What help he is there's no depending on.
396,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Off he goes always when I need him most.
397,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
398,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,"
399,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Enough at least to buy tobacco with,"
400,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,So he won't have to beg and be beholden.'
401,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay"
402,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.'"
403,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have
404,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,to.'
405,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I shouldn't mind his bettering himself
406,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"If that was what it was. You can be certain,"
407,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"When he begins like that, there's someone at him"
408,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,—-"
409,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"In haying time, when any help is scarce."
410,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"In winter he comes back to us. I'm done."""
411,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
412,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you,"" Mary said."
413,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
414,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I want him to: he'll have to soon or late."""
415,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
416,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove."
417,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,"
418,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,"
419,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"A miserable sight, and frightening, too—-"
420,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You needn't smile—-I didn't recognise him—-
421,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I wasn't looking for him—-and he's changed.
422,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Wait till you see."""
423,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
424,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Where did you say he'd been?"""
425,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
426,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,"
427,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.
428,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I tried to make him talk about his travels.
429,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off."""

442,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Of course he did. What would you have him say?"
443,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man
444,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Some humble way to save his self-respect.
445,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He added, if you really care to know,"
446,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He meant to clear the upper pasture, too."
447,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,That sounds like something you have heard before?
448,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Warren, I wish you could have heard the way"
449,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He jumbled everything. I stopped to look
450,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Two or three times—-he made me feel so queer—-
451,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To see if he was talking in his sleep.
452,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He ran on Harold Wilson—-you remember—-
453,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,The boy you had in haying four years since.
454,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He's finished school, and teaching in his college."
455,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Silas declares you'll have to get him back.
456,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He says they two will make a team for work:
457,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
458,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,The way he mixed that in with other things.
459,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft"
460,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,On education—-you know how they fought
461,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"All through July under the blazing sun,"
462,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Silas up on the cart to build the load,"
463,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Harold along beside to pitch it on."""
464,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
465,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot."""
466,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
467,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream."
468,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You wouldn't think they would. How some things
469,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,linger!
470,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.
471,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,After so many years he still keeps finding
472,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Good arguments he sees he might have used.
473,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I sympathise. I know just how it feels
474,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To think of the right thing to say too late.
475,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.
476,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying
477,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He studied Latin like the violin
478,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Because he liked it—-that an argument!
479,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He said he couldn't make the boy believe
480,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He could find water with a hazel prong—-
481,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Which showed how much good school had ever done
482,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,him.
483,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He wanted to go over that. But most of all
484,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He thinks if he could have another chance
485,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"To teach him how to build a load of hay----"""
486,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
487,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment."
488,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He bundles every forkful in its place,"
489,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And tags and numbers it for future reference,"
490,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,So he can find and easily dislodge it
491,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,In the unloading. Silas does that well.
492,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.
493,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You never see him standing on the hay
494,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself."""
495,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
496,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be"
497,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Some good perhaps to someone in the world.
498,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He hates to see a boy the fool of books.
499,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,"
500,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And nothing to look backward to with pride,"
501,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And nothing to look forward to with hope,"
502,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"So now and never any different."""
503,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
504,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Part of a moon was falling down the west,"
505,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.
506,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw
507,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand
508,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,"
509,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,"
510,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,As if she played unheard the tenderness
511,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,That wrought on him beside her in the night.
512,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Warren,"" she said, ""he has come home to die:"
513,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."""
514,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
515,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Home,"" he mocked gently."
516,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
517,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Yes, what else but home?"
518,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
519,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,It all depends on what you mean by home.
520,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Of course he's nothing to us, any more"
521,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
522,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."""
523,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
524,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Home is the place where, when you have to go"
525,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"there,"
526,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"They have to take you in."""
527,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
528,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I should have called it"
529,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Something you somehow haven't to deserve."""
530,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
531,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Warren leaned out and took a step or two,"
532,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Picked up a little stick, and brought it back"
533,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.
534,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Silas has better claim on us, you think,"
535,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles
536,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,As the road winds would bring him to his door.
537,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.
538,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich,"
539,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"A somebody—-director in the bank."""
540,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
541,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""He never told us that."""
542,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
543,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""We know it though."""
544,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
545,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I think his brother ought to help, of course."
546,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right
547,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"To take him in, and might be willing to—-"
548,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He may be better than appearances.
549,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,But have some pity on Silas. Do you think
550,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,If he'd had any pride in claiming kin
551,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Or anything he looked for from his brother,"
552,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He'd keep so still about him all this time?"""
553,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
554,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I wonder what's between them."""
555,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
556,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I can tell you."
557,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Silas is what he is—-we wouldn't mind him—-
558,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.
559,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He never did a thing so very bad.
560,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He don't know why he isn't quite as good
561,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,As anyone. He won't be made ashamed
562,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"To please his brother, worthless though he is."""
563,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
564,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""_I_ can't think Si ever hurt anyone."""
565,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
566,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay"
567,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged
568,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,chair-back.
569,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.
570,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You must go in and see what you can do.
571,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I made the bed up for him there to-night.
572,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You'll be surprised at him—-how much he's broken.
573,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"His working days are done; I'm sure of it."""
574,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
575,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I'd not be in a hurry to say that."""
576,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
577,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself."
578,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"But, Warren, please remember how it is:"
579,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He's come to help you ditch the meadow.
580,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.
581,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He may not speak of it, and then he may."
582,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud
583,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Will hit or miss the moon."""
584,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
585,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,It hit the moon.
586,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Then there were three there, making a dim row,"
587,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"The moon, the little silver cloud, and she."
588,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
589,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Warren returned—-too soon, it seemed to her,"
590,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited."
591,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
592,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Warren,"" she questioned."
593,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
594,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"""Dead,"" was all he answered."
595,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
596,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
597,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
598,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
599,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS
600,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,
601,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,
602,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I didn't make you know how glad I was
603,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,To have you come and camp here on our land.
604,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I promised myself to get down some day
605,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"And see the way you lived, but I don't know!"
606,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,With a houseful of hungry men to feed
607,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I guess you'd find. ... It seems to me
608,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I can't express my feelings any more
609,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Than I can raise my voice or want to lift
610,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to)."
611,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Did ever you feel so? I hope you never.
612,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,It's got so I don't even know for sure
613,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Whether I _am_ glad, sorry, or anything."
614,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,There's nothing but a voice-like left inside
615,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"That seems to tell me how I ought to feel,"
616,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.
617,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,You take the lake. I look and look at it.
618,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water."
619,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I stand and make myself repeat out loud
620,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"The advantages it has, so long and narrow,"
621,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Like a deep piece of some old running river
622,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles
623,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Straight away through the mountain notch
624,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"From the sink window where I wash the plates,"
625,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"And all our storms come up toward the house,"
626,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and
627,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,whiter.
628,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
629,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,To step outdoors and take the water dazzle
630,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"A sunny morning, or take the rising wind"
631,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"About my face and body and through my wrapper,"
632,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,"
633,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And a cold chill shivered across the lake.
634,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
635,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it?
636,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I expect, though, everyone's heard of it."
637,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,In a book about ferns? Listen to that!
638,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,You let things more like feathers regulate
639,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Your going and coming. And you like it here?
640,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I can see how you might. But I don't know!
641,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"It would be different if more people came,"
642,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"For then there would be business. As it is,"
643,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,"
644,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore
645,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"That ought to be worth something, and may yet."
646,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,But I don't count on it as much as Len.
647,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"He looks on the bright side of everything,"
648,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Including me. He thinks I'll be all right
649,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,With doctoring. But it's not medicine—-
650,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so—-
651,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"It's rest I want—-there, I have said it out—-"
652,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,From cooking meals for hungry hired men
653,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And washing dishes after them—-from doing
654,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Things over and over that just won't stay done.
655,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,By good rights I ought not to have so much
656,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Put on me, but there seems no other way."
657,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.
658,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,He says the best way out is always through.
659,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"And I agree to that, or in so far"
660,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,As that I can see no way out but through—-
661,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Leastways for me—-and then they'll be convinced.
662,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,It's not that Len don't want the best for me.
663,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,It was his plan our moving over in
664,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Beside the lake from where that day I showed you
665,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,We used to live—-ten miles from anywhere
666,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"We didn't change without some sacrifice,"
667,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,But Len went at it to make up the loss.
668,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,"
669,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,But he works when he works as hard as I do—-
670,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Though there's small profit in comparisons.
671,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,(Women and men will make them all the same.)
672,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.
673,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,He's into everything in town. This year
674,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"It's highways, and he's got too many men"
675,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Around him to look after that make waste.
676,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"They take advantage of him shamefully,"
677,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"And proud, too, of themselves for doing so."
678,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,"
679,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
680,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,While I fry their bacon. Much they care!
681,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,No more put out in what they do or say
682,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Than if I wasn't in the room at all.
683,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Coming and going all the time, they are:"
684,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I don't learn what their names are, let alone"
685,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Their characters, or whether they are safe"
686,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,To have inside the house with doors unlocked.
687,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not"
688,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Afraid of me. There's two can play at that.
689,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I have my fancies: it runs in the family.
690,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him
691,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Locked up for years back there at the old farm.
692,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I've been away once—-yes, I've been away."
693,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;
694,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;
695,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,You know the old idea—-the only asylum
696,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,"
697,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Rather than send their folks to such a place,"
698,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.
699,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,But it's not so: the place is the asylum.
700,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"There they have every means proper to do with,"
701,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And you aren't darkening other people's lives—-
702,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Worse than no good to them, and they no good"
703,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,To you in your condition; you can't know
704,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Affection or the want of it in that state.
705,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.
706,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"My father's brother, he went mad quite young."
707,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,"
708,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Because his violence took on the form
709,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
710,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"But it's more likely he was crossed in love,"
711,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Or so the story goes. It was some girl.
712,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Anyway, all he talked about was love."
713,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,They soon saw he would do someone a mischief
714,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended"
715,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"In father's building him a sort of cage,"
716,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Or room within a room, of hickory poles,"
717,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,—-"
718,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,A narrow passage all the way around.
719,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Anything they put in for furniture
720,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on."
721,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"So they made the place comfortable with straw,"
722,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences."
723,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Of course they had to feed him without dishes.
724,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded"
725,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,With his clothes on his arm—-all of his clothes.
726,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Cruel—-it sounds. I s'pose they did the best
727,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"They knew. And just when he was at the height,"
728,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Father and mother married, and mother came,"
729,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"A bride, to help take care of such a creature,"
730,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And accommodate her young life to his.
731,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,That was what marrying father meant to her.
732,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
733,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout
734,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Until the strength was shouted out of him,"
735,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.
736,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,"
737,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And let them go and make them twang until
738,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.
739,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's
740,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,play—-
741,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,"
742,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,They found a way to put a stop to it.
743,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,He was before my time—-I never saw him;
744,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,But the pen stayed exactly as it was
745,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"There in the upper chamber in the ell,"
746,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.
747,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I often think of the smooth hickory bars.
748,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"It got so I would say--you know, half fooling—-"
749,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"""It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail""—-"
750,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Just as you will till it becomes a habit.
751,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,No wonder I was glad to get away.
752,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Mind you, I waited till Len said the word."
753,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.
754,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,"
755,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"And I looked to be happy, and I was,"
756,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"As I said, for a while—-but I don't know!"
757,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.
758,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And there's more to it than just window-views
759,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And living by a lake. I'm past such help—-
760,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Unless Len took the notion, which he won't,"
761,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And I won't ask him—-it's not sure enough.
762,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:
763,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?"
764,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I almost think if I could do like you,"
765,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Drop everything and live out on the ground—-
766,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,"
767,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,"
768,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,And be glad of a good roof overhead.
769,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,"
770,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"More than you have yourself, some of these nights."
771,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
772,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,From over you as you lay in your beds.
773,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,I haven't courage for a risk like that.
774,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,"
775,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,"But the thing of it is, I need to _be_ kept."
776,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,There's work enough to do—-there's always that;

778,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS,Is set me back a little more behind.

788,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Willis, I didn't want you here to-day:"
789,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer's coming for the company.
790,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I'm going to sell my soul, or, rather, feet."
791,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know."""
792,THE SELF-SEEKER,
793,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""With you the feet have nearly been the soul;"

796,THE SELF-SEEKER,
797,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose"
798,THE SELF-SEEKER,"To try to help me drive a better bargain."""
799,THE SELF-SEEKER,
800,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Well, if it's true! Yours are no common feet."
801,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer don't know what it is he's buying:
802,THE SELF-SEEKER,So many miles you might have walked you won't
803,THE SELF-SEEKER,walk.
804,THE SELF-SEEKER,You haven't run your forty orchids down.
805,THE SELF-SEEKER,What does he think?—-How _are_ the blessed feet?
806,THE SELF-SEEKER,"The doctor's sure you're going to walk again?"""
807,THE SELF-SEEKER,
808,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""He thinks I'll hobble. It's both legs and feet."""

812,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I haven't dared to look at them uncovered."

816,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""The wonder is it hadn't been your head."""
817,THE SELF-SEEKER,
818,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""It's hard to tell you how I managed it."
819,THE SELF-SEEKER,"When I saw the shaft had me by the coat,"
820,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I didn't try too long to pull away,"
821,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Or fumble for my knife to cut away,"
822,THE SELF-SEEKER,I just embraced the shaft and rode it out—-
823,THE SELF-SEEKER,Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit.
824,THE SELF-SEEKER,"That's how I think I didn't lose my head,"
825,THE SELF-SEEKER,"But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling."""
826,THE SELF-SEEKER,
827,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Awful. Why didn't they throw off the belt"

830,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""They say sometime was wasted on the belt—-"
831,THE SELF-SEEKER,Old streak of leather—doesn't love me much
832,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Because I made him spit fire at my knuckles,"
833,THE SELF-SEEKER,The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string.
834,THE SELF-SEEKER,That must be it. Some days he won't stay on.
835,THE SELF-SEEKER,That day a woman couldn't coax him off.
836,THE SELF-SEEKER,He's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth
837,THE SELF-SEEKER,Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys.
838,THE SELF-SEEKER,Everything goes the same without me there.
839,THE SELF-SEEKER,"You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw"
840,THE SELF-SEEKER,Caterwaul to the hills around the village
841,THE SELF-SEEKER,As they both bite the wood. It's all our music.
842,THE SELF-SEEKER,One ought as a good villager to like it.
843,THE SELF-SEEKER,"No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound,"
844,THE SELF-SEEKER,"And it's our life."""

858,THE SELF-SEEKER,"You're bad enough to manage without her."""
859,THE SELF-SEEKER,
860,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""And I'm going to be worse instead of better."
861,THE SELF-SEEKER,You've got to tell me how far this is gone:
862,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Have you agreed to any price?"""
863,THE SELF-SEEKER,
864,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Five hundred."
865,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Five hundred—-five—-five! One, two, three, four,"
866,THE SELF-SEEKER,five.
867,THE SELF-SEEKER,"You needn't look at me."""
868,THE SELF-SEEKER,
869,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I don't believe you."""
870,THE SELF-SEEKER,
871,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I told you, Willis, when you first came in."
872,THE SELF-SEEKER,Don't you be hard on me. I have to take
873,THE SELF-SEEKER,"What I can get. You see they have the feet,"
874,THE SELF-SEEKER,Which gives them the advantage in the trade.
875,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I can't get back the feet in any case."""
876,THE SELF-SEEKER,
877,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""But your flowers, man, you're selling out your"

879,THE SELF-SEEKER,
880,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Yes, that's one way to put it—-all the flowers"
881,THE SELF-SEEKER,Of every kind everywhere in this region
882,THE SELF-SEEKER,For the next forty summers—-call it forty.
883,THE SELF-SEEKER,"But I'm not selling those, I'm giving them,"
884,THE SELF-SEEKER,They never earned me so much as one cent:
885,THE SELF-SEEKER,Money can't pay me for the loss of them.
886,THE SELF-SEEKER,"No, the five hundred was the sum they named"
887,THE SELF-SEEKER,To pay the doctor's bill and tide me over.
888,THE SELF-SEEKER,"It's that or fight, and I don't want to fight—-"
889,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I just want to get settled in my life,"
890,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Such as it's going to be, and know the worst,"
891,THE SELF-SEEKER,Or best—-it may not be so bad. The firm
892,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Promise me all the shooks I want to nail."""
893,THE SELF-SEEKER,
894,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""But what about your flora of the valley?"""
895,THE SELF-SEEKER,
896,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""You have me there. But that—-you didn't think"
897,THE SELF-SEEKER,"That was worth money to me? Still, I own"
898,THE SELF-SEEKER,It goes against me not to finish it
899,THE SELF-SEEKER,"For the friends it might bring me. By the way,"
900,THE SELF-SEEKER,I had a letter from Burroughs—-did I tell you?—-
901,THE SELF-SEEKER,About my _Cyprepedium reginœ_;
902,THE SELF-SEEKER,He says it's not reported so far north.
903,THE SELF-SEEKER,There! there's the bell. He's rung. But you go
904,THE SELF-SEEKER,down
905,THE SELF-SEEKER,"And bring him up, and don't let Mrs. Corbin.—-"
906,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it. I'm tired."""
907,THE SELF-SEEKER,
908,THE SELF-SEEKER,Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer
909,THE SELF-SEEKER,A little barefoot girl who in the noise
910,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house,"
911,THE SELF-SEEKER,"And baritone importance of the lawyer,"
912,THE SELF-SEEKER,Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands
913,THE SELF-SEEKER,Shyly behind her.
914,THE SELF-SEEKER,
915,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Well, and how is Mister---"""
916,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer was already in his satchel
917,THE SELF-SEEKER,As if for papers that might bear the name
918,THE SELF-SEEKER,"He hadn't at command. ""You must excuse me,"
919,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I dropped in at the mill and was detained."""
920,THE SELF-SEEKER,
921,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Looking round, I suppose,"" said Willis."
922,THE SELF-SEEKER,
923,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Well, yes."""
924,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Yes,"
925,THE SELF-SEEKER,
926,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Hear anything that might prove useful?"""
927,THE SELF-SEEKER,
928,THE SELF-SEEKER,"The Broken One saw Anne. ""Why, here is Anne"
929,THE SELF-SEEKER,"What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed;"
930,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Tell me what is it?"" Anne just wagged her dress"
931,THE SELF-SEEKER,"With both hands held behind her. ""Guess,"" she"
932,THE SELF-SEEKER,said.
933,THE SELF-SEEKER,
934,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Oh, guess which hand? My, my! Once on a"
935,THE SELF-SEEKER,time
936,THE SELF-SEEKER,I knew a lovely way to tell for certain
937,THE SELF-SEEKER,By looking in the ears. But I forget it.
938,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Er, let me see. I think 111 take the right."
939,THE SELF-SEEKER,That's sure to be right even if it's wrong.
940,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Come, hold it out. Don't change.—-A Ram's Horn"
941,THE SELF-SEEKER,orchid!
942,THE SELF-SEEKER,"A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder,"
943,THE SELF-SEEKER,If I had chosen left. Hold out the left.
944,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those,"
945,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?"""
946,THE SELF-SEEKER,
947,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side,"
948,THE SELF-SEEKER,And thought she wouldn't venture on so much.
949,THE SELF-SEEKER,
950,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Were there no others?"""
951,THE SELF-SEEKER,
952,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""There were four or five."
953,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all."""
954,THE SELF-SEEKER,
955,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I wouldn't—-so I wouldn't. You're the girl!"
956,THE SELF-SEEKER,"You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart."""
957,THE SELF-SEEKER,
958,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I wanted there should be some there next year."""
959,THE SELF-SEEKER,
960,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Of course you did. You left the rest for seed,"
961,THE SELF-SEEKER,And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl!
962,THE SELF-SEEKER,A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck
963,THE SELF-SEEKER,Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans
964,THE SELF-SEEKER,"To a discriminating appetite,"
965,THE SELF-SEEKER,Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had
966,THE SELF-SEEKER,In bushel lots—-doesn't come on the market.
967,THE SELF-SEEKER,"But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all?"
968,THE SELF-SEEKER,You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying.
969,THE SELF-SEEKER,You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe
970,THE SELF-SEEKER,With a lawyer at hand to find you out.
971,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne."
972,THE SELF-SEEKER,You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's
973,THE SELF-SEEKER,Horn
974,THE SELF-SEEKER,You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper.
975,THE SELF-SEEKER,"What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would."
976,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Don't you defend yourself. If it was there,"
977,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?"""
978,THE SELF-SEEKER,
979,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Well, wait—it's common—-it's too _common._"""
980,THE SELF-SEEKER,
981,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Common?"
982,THE SELF-SEEKER,"The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner."""
983,THE SELF-SEEKER,
984,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper"
985,THE SELF-SEEKER,To _You_-—to you I mean—-they're both too
986,THE SELF-SEEKER,"common."""
987,THE SELF-SEEKER,
988,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers
989,THE SELF-SEEKER,As if with some idea that she had scored.
990,THE SELF-SEEKER,
991,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets."
992,THE SELF-SEEKER,It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped
993,THE SELF-SEEKER,though:
994,THE SELF-SEEKER,Pressed into service means pressed out of shape.
995,THE SELF-SEEKER,Somehow I'll make it right with her—-she'll see.
996,THE SELF-SEEKER,"She's going to do my scouting in the field,"
997,THE SELF-SEEKER,Over stone walls and all along a wood
998,THE SELF-SEEKER,"And by a river bank for water flowers,"
999,THE SELF-SEEKER,"The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,"
1000,THE SELF-SEEKER,And at the _sinus_ under water a fist
1001,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Of little fingers all kept down but one,"
1002,THE SELF-SEEKER,And that thrust up to blossom in the sun
1003,THE SELF-SEEKER,As if to say 'You! You're the Heart's desire.'
1004,THE SELF-SEEKER,Anne has a way with flowers to take the place
1005,THE SELF-SEEKER,Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee
1006,THE SELF-SEEKER,And lifts their faces by the chin to hers
1007,THE SELF-SEEKER,"And says their names, and leaves them where they"
1008,THE SELF-SEEKER,"are."""
1009,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1010,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer wore a watch the case of which
1011,THE SELF-SEEKER,Was cunningly devised to make a noise
1012,THE SELF-SEEKER,Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut
1013,THE SELF-SEEKER,At such a time as this. He snapped it now.
1014,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1015,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait."
1016,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer man is thinking of his train.
1017,THE SELF-SEEKER,He wants to give me lots and lots of money
1018,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Before he goes, because I hurt myself,"
1019,THE SELF-SEEKER,And it may take him I don't know how long.
1020,THE SELF-SEEKER,"But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her:"
1021,THE SELF-SEEKER,The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup?
1022,THE SELF-SEEKER,Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher.
1023,THE SELF-SEEKER,Now run.—-Get out your documents! You see
1024,THE SELF-SEEKER,I have to keep on the good side of Anne.
1025,THE SELF-SEEKER,I'm a great boy to think of number one.
1026,THE SELF-SEEKER,And you can't blame me in the place I'm in.
1027,THE SELF-SEEKER,Who will take care of my necessities
1028,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Unless I do?"""
1029,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1030,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""A pretty interlude,"""
1031,THE SELF-SEEKER,"The lawyer said: ""I'm sorry, but my train----"
1032,THE SELF-SEEKER,Luckily terms are all agreed upon.
1033,THE SELF-SEEKER,"You only have to sign your name. Right—-there."""
1034,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1035,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here"
1036,THE SELF-SEEKER,Where you can't make them. What is it you want?
1037,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go."""
1038,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1039,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?"""
1040,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1041,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Make yourself useful then, and read it for me."
1042,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Isn't it something I have seen before?"""
1043,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1044,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it."""
1045,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1046,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much"
1047,THE SELF-SEEKER,In haste to get it over with as you.
1048,THE SELF-SEEKER,"But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain:"
1049,THE SELF-SEEKER,Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.—-
1050,THE SELF-SEEKER,"What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool."
1051,THE SELF-SEEKER,You! crumpling folkses' legal documents.
1052,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Out with it if you've any real objection."""
1053,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1054,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Five hundred dollars!"""
1055,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1056,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""What would you think right?"""
1057,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1058,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much;"
1059,THE SELF-SEEKER,"You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is"
1060,THE SELF-SEEKER,Accepting anything before he knows
1061,THE SELF-SEEKER,Whether he's ever going to walk again.
1062,THE SELF-SEEKER,"It smells to me like a dishonest trick."""
1063,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1064,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""I think—-I think—-from what I heard to-day—-"
1065,THE SELF-SEEKER,"And saw myself—-he would be ill-advised----"""
1066,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1067,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""What did you hear, for instance?"" Willis said."
1068,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1069,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Now the place where the accident occurred----"""
1070,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1071,THE SELF-SEEKER,The Broken One was twisted in his bed.
1072,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""This is between you two apparently."
1073,THE SELF-SEEKER,Where I come in is what I want to know.
1074,THE SELF-SEEKER,You stand up to it like a pair of cocks.
1075,THE SELF-SEEKER,Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me.
1076,THE SELF-SEEKER,"When you come back, I'll have the papers signed."
1077,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen."
1078,THE SELF-SEEKER,"One of you hold my head up from the pillow."""
1079,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1080,THE SELF-SEEKER,"Willis flung off the bed. ""I wash my hands—-"
1081,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I'm no match—-no, and don't pretend to be----"""
1082,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1083,THE SELF-SEEKER,The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen.
1084,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it."
1085,THE SELF-SEEKER,"We're very sorry for you."""
1086,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1087,THE SELF-SEEKER,Willis sneered:
1088,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Who's _we?_—-some stockholders in Boston?"
1089,THE SELF-SEEKER,"I'll go outdoors, by gad! and won't come back."""
1090,THE SELF-SEEKER,
1091,THE SELF-SEEKER,"""Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come."
1092,THE SELF-SEEKER,Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's
1093,THE SELF-SEEKER,savage.
1094,THE SELF-SEEKER,He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers.
1095,THE SELF-SEEKER,You don't know what I mean about the flowers.
1096,THE SELF-SEEKER,Don't stop to try now. You'll miss your train.

1152,THE SMILE,"Still, he smiled—-did you see him?—-I was sure!"
1153,THE SMILE,Perhaps because we gave him only bread
1154,THE SMILE,And the wretch knew from that that we were poor.

1366,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"Beside it, and there may be two or three"

1370,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
1371,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
1372,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I got from looking through a pane of glass
1373,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
1374,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,And held against the world of hoary grass.

1386,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
1387,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,The rumbling sound
1388,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,Of load on load of apples coming in.
1389,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,For I have had too much
1390,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,Of apple-picking: I am overtired

1410,BIRCHES,
1411,BIRCHES,
1412,BIRCHES,When I see birches bend to left and right
1413,BIRCHES,"Across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
1414,BIRCHES,I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
1415,BIRCHES,But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
1416,BIRCHES,Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
1417,BIRCHES,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
1418,BIRCHES,After a rain. They click upon themselves
1419,BIRCHES,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured"
1420,BIRCHES,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
1421,BIRCHES,Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal
1422,BIRCHES,shells
1423,BIRCHES,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—-
1424,BIRCHES,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
1425,BIRCHES,You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
1426,BIRCHES,They are dragged to the withered bracken by the
1427,BIRCHES,"load,"
1428,BIRCHES,And they seem not to break; though once they are
1429,BIRCHES,bowed
1430,BIRCHES,"So low for long, they never right themselves:"
1431,BIRCHES,You may see their trunks arching in the woods
1432,BIRCHES,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,"
1433,BIRCHES,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
1434,BIRCHES,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
1435,BIRCHES,But I was going to say when Truth broke in
1436,BIRCHES,"With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,"
1437,BIRCHES,I should prefer to have some boy bend them
1438,BIRCHES,As he went out and in to fetch the cows—-
1439,BIRCHES,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
1440,BIRCHES,"Whose only play was what he found himself,"
1441,BIRCHES,"Summer or winter, and could play alone."
1442,BIRCHES,One by one he subdued his father's trees
1443,BIRCHES,By riding them down over and over again
1444,BIRCHES,"Until he took the stiffness out of them,"
1445,BIRCHES,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left"
1446,BIRCHES,For him to conquer. He learned all there was
1447,BIRCHES,To learn about not launching out too soon
1448,BIRCHES,And so not carrying the tree away
1449,BIRCHES,Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise
1450,BIRCHES,"To the top branches, climbing carefully"
1451,BIRCHES,With the same pains you use to fill a cup
1452,BIRCHES,"Up to the brim, and even above the brim."
1453,BIRCHES,"Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
1454,BIRCHES,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
1455,BIRCHES,So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
1456,BIRCHES,And so I dream of going back to be.
1457,BIRCHES,"It's when I'm weary of considerations,"
1458,BIRCHES,And life is too much like a pathless wood
1459,BIRCHES,Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
1460,BIRCHES,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
1461,BIRCHES,From a twig's having lashed across it open.
1462,BIRCHES,I'd like to get away from earth awhile
1463,BIRCHES,And then come back to it and begin over.
1464,BIRCHES,May no fate wilfully misunderstand me
1465,BIRCHES,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
1466,BIRCHES,Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:
1467,BIRCHES,I don't know where it's likely to go better.
1468,BIRCHES,"I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
1469,BIRCHES,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
1470,BIRCHES,"_Toward_ heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
1471,BIRCHES,But dipped its top and set me down again.
1472,BIRCHES,That would be good both going and coming back.
1473,BIRCHES,One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

1486,THE GUM-GATHERER,And half the bag wound round his hand.

1491,THE GUM-GATHERER,"To be coming home the way I was,"
1492,THE GUM-GATHERER,He told me a little about himself.

1495,THE GUM-GATHERER,Is blocks split off the mountain mass—-
1496,THE GUM-GATHERER,And hopeless grist enough it looks

1498,THE GUM-GATHERER,(The way it is will do for moss.)
1499,THE GUM-GATHERER,There he had built his stolen shack.
1500,THE GUM-GATHERER,It had to be a stolen shack
1501,THE GUM-GATHERER,Because of the fears of fire and loss
1502,THE GUM-GATHERER,That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:

1507,THE GUM-GATHERER,Or a basket of eggs between their feet;
1508,THE GUM-GATHERER,What this man brought in a cotton sack
1509,THE GUM-GATHERER,"Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce."
1510,THE GUM-GATHERER,He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
1511,THE GUM-GATHERER,"Like uncut jewels, dull and rough."
1512,THE GUM-GATHERER,It comes to market golden brown;
1513,THE GUM-GATHERER,But turns to pink between the teeth.
1514,THE GUM-GATHERER,
1515,THE GUM-GATHERER,I told him this is a pleasant life
1516,THE GUM-GATHERER,To set your breast to the bark of trees
1517,THE GUM-GATHERER,"That all your days are dim beneath,"
1518,THE GUM-GATHERER,"And reaching up with a little knife,"
1519,THE GUM-GATHERER,To loose the resin and take it down

1526,THE MOUNTAIN,
1527,THE MOUNTAIN,
1528,THE MOUNTAIN,The mountain held the town as in a shadow.
1529,THE MOUNTAIN,I saw so much before I slept there once:
1530,THE MOUNTAIN,"I noticed that I missed stars in the west,"
1531,THE MOUNTAIN,Where its black body cut into the sky.
1532,THE MOUNTAIN,Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall
1533,THE MOUNTAIN,Behind which I was sheltered from a wind.
1534,THE MOUNTAIN,"And yet between the town and it I found,"
1535,THE MOUNTAIN,"When I walked forth at dawn to see new things,"
1536,THE MOUNTAIN,"Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields."
1537,THE MOUNTAIN,"The river at the time was fallen away,"
1538,THE MOUNTAIN,And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones;
1539,THE MOUNTAIN,But the signs showed what it had done in spring;
1540,THE MOUNTAIN,"Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass"
1541,THE MOUNTAIN,"Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark."
1542,THE MOUNTAIN,I crossed the river and swung round the mountain.
1543,THE MOUNTAIN,And there I met a man who moved so slow
1544,THE MOUNTAIN,"With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart,"
1545,THE MOUNTAIN,It seemed no harm to stop him altogether.
1546,THE MOUNTAIN,
1547,THE MOUNTAIN,"""What town is this?"" I asked."
1548,THE MOUNTAIN,
1549,THE MOUNTAIN,"""This? Lunenburg."""
1550,THE MOUNTAIN,"Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,"
1551,THE MOUNTAIN,"Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,"
1552,THE MOUNTAIN,But only felt at night its shadowy presence.
1553,THE MOUNTAIN,"""Where is your village? Very far from here?"""
1554,THE MOUNTAIN,
1555,THE MOUNTAIN,"""There is no village—-only scattered farms."
1556,THE MOUNTAIN,We were but sixty voters last election.
1557,THE MOUNTAIN,We can't in nature grow to many more:
1558,THE MOUNTAIN,"That thing takes all the room!"" He moved his goad."
1559,THE MOUNTAIN,The mountain stood there to be pointed at.
1560,THE MOUNTAIN,"Pasture ran up the side a little way,"
1561,THE MOUNTAIN,And then there was a wall of trees with trunks:
1562,THE MOUNTAIN,"After that only tops of trees, and cliffs"
1563,THE MOUNTAIN,Imperfectly concealed among the leaves.
1564,THE MOUNTAIN,A dry ravine emerged from under boughs
1565,THE MOUNTAIN,Into the pasture.
1566,THE MOUNTAIN,
1567,THE MOUNTAIN,"""That looks like a path."

1571,THE MOUNTAIN,
1572,THE MOUNTAIN,"""I don't advise your trying from this side."
1573,THE MOUNTAIN,"There is no proper path, but those that _have_"
1574,THE MOUNTAIN,"Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's."
1575,THE MOUNTAIN,That's five miles back. You can't mistake the place:

1585,THE MOUNTAIN,"But what would interest you about the brook,"
1586,THE MOUNTAIN,"It's always cold in summer, warm in winter."
1587,THE MOUNTAIN,One of the great sights going is to see
1588,THE MOUNTAIN,It steam in winter like an ox's breath.

1594,THE MOUNTAIN,From such a mountain—-if it isn't wooded

1598,THE MOUNTAIN,With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet;
1599,THE MOUNTAIN,"Or turn and sit on and look out and down,"
1600,THE MOUNTAIN,With little ferns in crevices at his elbow.
1601,THE MOUNTAIN,
1602,THE MOUNTAIN,"""As to that I can't say. But there's the spring,"
1603,THE MOUNTAIN,"Right on the summit, almost like a fountain."

1608,THE MOUNTAIN,
1609,THE MOUNTAIN,I guess there's no doubt

1611,THE MOUNTAIN,It may not be right on the very top:
1612,THE MOUNTAIN,It wouldn't have to be a long way down
1613,THE MOUNTAIN,"To have some head of water from above,"
1614,THE MOUNTAIN,And a _good distance_ down might not be noticed
1615,THE MOUNTAIN,By anyone who'd come a long way up.

1619,THE MOUNTAIN,"""What did he say?"""
1620,THE MOUNTAIN,
1621,THE MOUNTAIN,"""He said there was a lake"

1625,THE MOUNTAIN,
1626,THE MOUNTAIN,"""He never got up high enough to see."
1627,THE MOUNTAIN,That's why I don't advise your trying this side.
1628,THE MOUNTAIN,He tried this side. I've always meant to go
1629,THE MOUNTAIN,"And look myself, but you know how it is:"
1630,THE MOUNTAIN,It doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain
1631,THE MOUNTAIN,You've worked around the foot of all your life.
1632,THE MOUNTAIN,"What would I do? Go in my overalls,"
1633,THE MOUNTAIN,"With a big stick, the same as when the cows"
1634,THE MOUNTAIN,Haven't come down to the bars at milking time?

1678,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,The dew was gone that made his blade so keen
1679,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Before I came to view the levelled scene.
1680,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
1681,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,I looked for him behind an isle of trees;
1682,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.
1683,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
1684,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,"

1698,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
1699,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"And then he flew as far as eye could see,"

1701,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
1702,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"I thought of questions that have no reply,"
1703,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;

1705,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"But he turned first, and led my eye to look"
1706,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,"
1707,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
1708,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
1709,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.
1710,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
1711,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"I left my place to know them by their name,"
1712,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Finding them butterfly weed when I came.
1713,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,

2042,SNOW,

2046,SNOW,He pointed with his hand from where it lay
2047,SNOW,Like a white crumpled spider on his knee:
2048,SNOW,"""That leaf there in your open book! It moved"
2049,SNOW,"Just then, I thought. It's stood erect like that,"
2050,SNOW,"There on the table, ever since I came,"
2051,SNOW,"Trying to turn itself backward or forward,"
2052,SNOW,I've had my eye on it to make out which;
2053,SNOW,"If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience—-"
2054,SNOW,You see I know—-to get you on to things
2055,SNOW,"It wants to see how you will take, if backward"
2056,SNOW,It's from regret for something you have passed
2057,SNOW,"And failed to see the good of. Never mind,"
2058,SNOW,Things must expect to come in front of us
2059,SNOW,A many times—-I don't say just how many—-
2060,SNOW,That varies with the things—-before we see them.
2061,SNOW,One of the lies would make it out that nothing
2062,SNOW,Ever presents itself before us twice.
2063,SNOW,Where would we be at last if that were so?
2064,SNOW,Our very life depends on everything's
2065,SNOW,Recurring till we answer from within.
2066,SNOW,The thousandth time may prove the charm.—-That
2067,SNOW,leaf!
2068,SNOW,It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.
2069,SNOW,But the wind didn't move it if it moved.
2070,SNOW,It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.
2071,SNOW,It couldn't stir so sensitively poised
2072,SNOW,A thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp
2073,SNOW,"To get a puff of black smoke from the flame,"
2074,SNOW,Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.
2075,SNOW,"You make a little foursquare block of air,"
2076,SNOW,"Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all"
2077,SNOW,"The illimitable dark and cold and storm,"
2078,SNOW,"And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,"
2079,SNOW,"And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;"
2080,SNOW,"Though for all anyone can tell, repose"
2081,SNOW,"May be the thing you haven't, yet you give it."
2082,SNOW,So false it is that what we haven't we can't give;
2083,SNOW,"So false, that what we always say is true."
2084,SNOW,I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.
2085,SNOW,"It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?"""
2086,SNOW,

2090,SNOW,And show you how it's piling up against you.
2091,SNOW,You see the snow-white through the white of frost?
2092,SNOW,Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbed

2100,SNOW,"Of its own stupid lack of understanding,"
2101,SNOW,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff
2102,SNOW,"Short off, and died against the window-pane."""
2103,SNOW,
2104,SNOW,"""Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself"
2105,SNOW,More than you will us with such nightmare talk.

2110,SNOW,
2111,SNOW,"""Before you drop the curtain—-I'm reminded:"
2112,SNOW,You recollect the boy who came out here
2113,SNOW,To breathe the air one winter—-had a room
2114,SNOW,"Down at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning"
2115,SNOW,"After a downy storm, he passed our place"
2116,SNOW,And found me banking up the house with snow.
2117,SNOW,"And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,"
2118,SNOW,Piling it well above the window-sills.
2119,SNOW,The snow against the window caught his eye.
2120,SNOW,"'Hey, that's a pretty thought'—-those were his"
2121,SNOW,words.
2122,SNOW,"'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,"
2123,SNOW,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.
2124,SNOW,You can't get too much winter in the winter.'
2125,SNOW,Those were his words. And he went home and
2126,SNOW,all
2127,SNOW,But banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.
2128,SNOW,Now you and I would go to no such length.
2129,SNOW,At the same time you can't deny it makes
2130,SNOW,"It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,"
2131,SNOW,"Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run"
2132,SNOW,So high across the pane outside. There where
2133,SNOW,There is a sort of tunnel in the frost
2134,SNOW,More like a tunnel than a hole—-way down
2135,SNOW,At the far end of it you see a stir
2136,SNOW,And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift
2137,SNOW,Blown in the wind. I _like_ that—-I like that.
2138,SNOW,"Well, now I leave you, people."""
2139,SNOW,
2140,SNOW,"""Come, Meserve,"

2145,SNOW,"""I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow."

2148,SNOW,"Sounds further off, it's not because it's dying;"
2149,SNOW,You're further under in the snow—-that's all—-
2150,SNOW,And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust

2935,THE CODE,
2936,THE CODE,There were three in the meadow by the brook
2937,THE CODE,"Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay,"
2938,THE CODE,With an eye always lifted toward the west
2939,THE CODE,Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud
2940,THE CODE,Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger
2941,THE CODE,Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly
2942,THE CODE,"One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,"
2943,THE CODE,Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.
2944,THE CODE,The town-bred farmer failed to understand.
2945,THE CODE,
2946,THE CODE,"""What was there wrong?"""
2947,THE CODE,
2948,THE CODE,"""Something you just now said."""
2949,THE CODE,
2950,THE CODE,"""What did I say?"""
2951,THE CODE,
2952,THE CODE,"""About our taking pains."
2953,THE CODE,
2954,THE CODE,"""To cock the hay?—-because it's going to shower?"
2955,THE CODE,I said that more than half an hour ago.
2956,THE CODE,"I said it to myself as much as you."""
2957,THE CODE,
2958,THE CODE,"""You didn't know. But James is one big fool."
2959,THE CODE,He thought you meant to find fault with his work.
2960,THE CODE,That's what the average farmer would have meant.
2961,THE CODE,"James would take time, of course, to chew it over"
2962,THE CODE,"Before he acted: he's just got round to act."""
2963,THE CODE,
2964,THE CODE,"""He is a fool if that's the way he takes me."""
2965,THE CODE,
2966,THE CODE,"""Don't let it bother you. You've found out"
2967,THE CODE,something.
2968,THE CODE,The hand that knows his business won't be told
2969,THE CODE,To do work better or faster—-those two things.
2970,THE CODE,I'm as particular as anyone:
2971,THE CODE,Most likely I'd have served you just the same.
2972,THE CODE,But I know you don't understand our ways.
2973,THE CODE,"You were just talking what was in your mind,"
2974,THE CODE,"What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting."
2975,THE CODE,
2976,THE CODE,Tell you a story of what happened once:
2977,THE CODE,I was up here in Salem at a man's
2978,THE CODE,Named Sanders with a gang of four or five
2979,THE CODE,Doing the haying. No one liked the boss.
2980,THE CODE,"He was one of the kind sports call a spider,"
2981,THE CODE,All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy
2982,THE CODE,From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit.
2983,THE CODE,"But work! that man could work, especially"
2984,THE CODE,"If by so doing he could get more work,"
2985,THE CODE,Out of his hired help. I'm not denying
2986,THE CODE,He was hard on himself. I couldn't find
2987,THE CODE,That he kept any hours—-not for himself.
2988,THE CODE,Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:
2989,THE CODE,I've heard him pounding in the barn all night.
2990,THE CODE,But what he liked was someone to encourage.
2991,THE CODE,Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind
2992,THE CODE,"And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing—-"
2993,THE CODE,Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs
2994,THE CODE,off.
2995,THE CODE,I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks
2996,THE CODE,(We call that bulling). I'd been watching him.
2997,THE CODE,So when he paired off with me in the hayfield
2998,THE CODE,"To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble."
2999,THE CODE,I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders
3000,THE CODE,"Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.'"
3001,THE CODE,Everything went well till we reached the barn
3002,THE CODE,With a big jag to empty in a bay.
3003,THE CODE,You understand that meant the easy job
3004,THE CODE,For the man up on top of throwing _down_
3005,THE CODE,"The hay and rolling it off wholesale,"
3006,THE CODE,Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.
3007,THE CODE,You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging
3008,THE CODE,"Under those circumstances, would you now?"
3009,THE CODE,"But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,"
3010,THE CODE,"And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,"
3011,THE CODE,"Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!"
3012,THE CODE,"Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you"
3013,THE CODE,said?'
3014,THE CODE,"I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake,"
3015,THE CODE,"'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.'"
3016,THE CODE,"He said it over, but he said it softer."
3017,THE CODE,"Never you say a thing like that to a man,"
3018,THE CODE,"Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon"
3019,THE CODE,Murdered him as left out his middle name.
3020,THE CODE,I'd built the load and knew right where to find it.
3021,THE CODE,Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for
3022,THE CODE,"Like meditating, and then I just dug in"
3023,THE CODE,"And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots,"
3024,THE CODE,I looked over the side once in the dust
3025,THE CODE,"And caught sight of him treading-water-like,"
3026,THE CODE,"Keeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says,"
3027,THE CODE,'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.
3028,THE CODE,That was the last I saw or heard of him.
3029,THE CODE,I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.
3030,THE CODE,"As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,"
3031,THE CODE,"And sort of waiting to be asked about it,"
3032,THE CODE,"One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?'"
3033,THE CODE,'I left him in the barn under the hay.
3034,THE CODE,"If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.'"
3035,THE CODE,They realised from the way I swobbed my neck
3036,THE CODE,More than was needed something must be up.
3037,THE CODE,They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.
3038,THE CODE,"They told me afterward. First they forked hay,"
3039,THE CODE,"A lot of it, out into the barn floor."
3040,THE CODE,Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.
3041,THE CODE,I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple
3042,THE CODE,"Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed."
3043,THE CODE,They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife
3044,THE CODE,"Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window,"
3045,THE CODE,And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen
3046,THE CODE,"Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet"
3047,THE CODE,"Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer."
3048,THE CODE,He looked so clean disgusted from behind
3049,THE CODE,"There was no one that dared to stir him up,"
3050,THE CODE,Or let him know that he was being looked at.
3051,THE CODE,Apparently I hadn't buried him
3052,THE CODE,(I may have knocked him down); but my just
3053,THE CODE,trying
3054,THE CODE,To bury him had hurt his dignity.
3055,THE CODE,He had gone to the house so's not to meet me.
3056,THE CODE,He kept away from us all afternoon.
3057,THE CODE,We tended to his hay. We saw him out
3058,THE CODE,After a while picking peas in his garden:
3059,THE CODE,"He couldn't keep away from doing something."""
3060,THE CODE,
3061,THE CODE,"""Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?"""
3062,THE CODE,
3063,THE CODE,"""No! and yet I don't know—-it's hard to say."
3064,THE CODE,"I went about to kill him fair enough."""
3065,THE CODE,
3066,THE CODE,"""You took an awkward way. Did he discharge"
3067,THE CODE,"you?"""
3068,THE CODE,"""Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right."""

3075,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3076,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Lancaster bore him—-such a little town,"
3077,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Such a great man. It doesn't see him often
3078,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead"
3079,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And sends the children down there with their mother
3080,A HUNDRED COLLARS,To run wild in the summer—-a little wild.
3081,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Sometimes he joins them for a day or two
3082,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.
3083,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"They meet him in the general store at night,"
3084,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Preoccupied with formidable mail,"
3085,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Rifling a printed letter as he talks.
3086,A HUNDRED COLLARS,They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so:
3087,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Though a great scholar, he's a democrat,"
3088,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"If not at heart, at least on principle."
3089,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Lately when coming up to Lancaster
3090,A HUNDRED COLLARS,His train being late he missed another train
3091,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction
3092,A HUNDRED COLLARS,After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired
3093,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"To think of sitting such an ordeal out,"
3094,A HUNDRED COLLARS,He turned to the hotel to find a bed.
3095,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3096,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""No room,"" the night clerk said. ""Unless----"""
3097,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps
3098,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And cars that shock and rattle—-and _one_ hotel.
3099,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3100,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""You say 'unless.'"""
3101,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3102,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Unless you wouldn't mind"
3103,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Sharing a room with someone else."""
3104,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3105,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Who is it?"""
3106,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3107,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""A man."
3108,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3109,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""So I should hope. What kind of man?"""
3110,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3111,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""I know him: he's all right. A man's a man."
3112,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Separate beds of course you understand."""
3113,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3114,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.
3115,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Who's that man sleeping in the office chair?"
3116,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Has he had the refusal of my chance?"""
3117,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3118,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""He was afraid of being robbed or murdered."
3119,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"What do you say?"""
3120,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3121,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""I'll have to have a bed."""
3122,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3123,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs
3124,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"And down a narrow passage full of doors,"
3125,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"At the last one of which he knocked and entered,"
3126,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your"
3127,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"room."""
3128,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3129,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him,"
3130,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself."""
3131,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.
3132,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""This will be yours. Good-night,"" he said, and"
3133,A HUNDRED COLLARS,went.
3134,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3135,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Lafe was the name, I think?"""
3136,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3137,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Yes, _Lay_fayette."
3138,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"You got it the first time. And yours?"""
3139,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3140,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Magoon."
3141,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3142,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Doctor Magoon."""
3143,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3144,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""A Doctor?"""
3145,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3146,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Well, a teacher."""
3147,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3148,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired?"
3149,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Hold on, there's something I don't think of now"
3150,A HUNDRED COLLARS,That I had on my mind to ask the first
3151,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Man that knew anything I happened in with.
3152,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"I'll ask you later—-don't let me forget it."""
3153,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.
3154,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"A man? A brute. Naked above the waist,"
3155,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"He sat there creased and shining in the light,"
3156,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.
3157,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""I'm moving into a size-larger shirt."
3158,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it.
3159,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I just found what the matter was to-night:
3160,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I've been a-choking like a nursery tree
3161,A HUNDRED COLLARS,When it outgrows the wide band of its name tag.
3162,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having.
3163,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,"
3164,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Not liking to own up I'd grown a size.
3165,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?"""
3166,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3167,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The Doctor caught his throat convulsively.
3168,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Oh—-ah—-fourteen—-fourteen."""
3169,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3170,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Fourteen! You say so!"
3171,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I can remember when I wore fourteen.
3172,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And come to think I must have back at home
3173,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"More than a hundred collars, size fourteen."
3174,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.
3175,A HUNDRED COLLARS,They're yours and welcome; let me send them to
3176,A HUNDRED COLLARS,you.
3177,A HUNDRED COLLARS,What makes you stand there on one leg like that?
3178,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you,"
3179,A HUNDRED COLLARS,You act as if you wished you hadn't come.
3180,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Sit down or lie down friend; you make me nervous."""
3181,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3182,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"The Doctor made a subdued dash for it,"
3183,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And propped himself at bay against a pillow.
3184,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3185,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white"
3186,A HUNDRED COLLARS,bed.
3187,A HUNDRED COLLARS,You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes
3188,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"off."""
3189,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3190,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Don't touch me, please—-I say, don't touch me,"
3191,A HUNDRED COLLARS,please.
3192,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"I'll not be put to bed by you, my man."""
3193,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3194,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Just as you say. Have it your own way then."
3195,A HUNDRED COLLARS,'My man' is it? You talk like a professor.
3196,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Speaking of who's afraid of who, however,"
3197,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I'm thinking I have more to lose than you
3198,A HUNDRED COLLARS,If anything should happen to be wrong.

3210,A HUNDRED COLLARS,You'd better tuck your money under you
3211,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And sleep on it the way I always do

3218,A HUNDRED COLLARS,My ninety isn't mine—-you won't think that.
3219,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I pick it up a dollar at a time

3226,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Now we are getting on together—-talking.
3227,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I'm sort of Something for it at the front.
3228,A HUNDRED COLLARS,My business is to find what people want:
3229,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"They pay for it, and so they ought to have it."
3230,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Fairbanks, he says to me—-he's editor—-"
3231,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Feel out the public sentiment—-he says.
3232,A HUNDRED COLLARS,A good deal comes on me when all is said.
3233,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The only trouble is we disagree
3234,A HUNDRED COLLARS,In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat—-
3235,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"You know what that is, sort of double-dyed;"
3236,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The _News_ has always been Republican.
3237,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,'"
3238,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says,"
3239,A HUNDRED COLLARS,'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough:
3240,A HUNDRED COLLARS,It's time you turned around and boosted us.
3241,A HUNDRED COLLARS,You'll have to pay me more than ten a week

3251,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3252,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""It's business, but I can't say it's not fun."
3253,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"What I like best's the lay of different farms,"
3254,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Coming out on them from a stretch of woods,"
3255,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Or over a hill or round a sudden corner.
3256,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"I like to find folks getting out in spring,"
3257,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Raking the dooryard, working near the house."
3258,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Later they get out further in the fields.
3259,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Everything's shut sometimes except the barn;
3260,A HUNDRED COLLARS,The family's all away in some back meadow.
3261,A HUNDRED COLLARS,There's a hay load a-coming—-when it comes.
3262,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And later still they all get driven in:
3263,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches"
3264,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees"
3265,A HUNDRED COLLARS,To whips and poles. There's nobody about.
3266,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk"
3267,A HUNDRED COLLARS,smoking.
3268,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And I lie back and ride. I take the reins
3269,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Only when someone's coming, and the mare"
3270,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go.
3271,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.
3272,A HUNDRED COLLARS,She's got so she turns in at every house
3273,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"As if she had some sort of curvature,"
3274,A HUNDRED COLLARS,No matter if I have no errand there.
3275,A HUNDRED COLLARS,She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am.
3276,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"It's seldom I get down except for meals, though."
3277,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,"
3278,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"All in a family row down to the youngest."""
3279,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3280,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""One would suppose they might not be as glad"

3284,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Because I want their dollar. I don't want
3285,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Anything they've not got. I never dun.
3286,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"I'm there, and they can pay me if they like."
3287,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.
3288,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink.
3289,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I drink out of the bottle—-not your style.
3290,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Mayn't I offer you----?"""
3291,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3292,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""No, no, no, thank you."
3293,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3294,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.—-"
3295,A HUNDRED COLLARS,And now I'm leaving you a little while.
3296,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3297,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps—-"
3298,A HUNDRED COLLARS,Lie down—-let yourself go and get some sleep.
3299,A HUNDRED COLLARS,But first—-let's see—-what was I going to ask you?
3300,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Those collars—-who shall I address them to,"
3301,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?"""
3302,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
3303,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""Really, friend, I can't let you. You—-may need"

3310,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"""I don't know who I rather would have have them."
3311,A HUNDRED COLLARS,They're only turning yellow where they are.
3312,A HUNDRED COLLARS,But you're the doctor as the saying is.
3313,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me:
3314,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I've just begun the night. You get some sleep.
3315,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door
3316,A HUNDRED COLLARS,When I come back so you'll know who it is.
3317,A HUNDRED COLLARS,There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.
3318,A HUNDRED COLLARS,I don't want you should shoot me in the head.
3319,A HUNDRED COLLARS,What am I doing carrying off this bottle?
3320,A HUNDRED COLLARS,"There now, you get some sleep."""
3321,A HUNDRED COLLARS,
