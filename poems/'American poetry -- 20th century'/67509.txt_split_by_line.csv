32,VORSPIEL,(_Wild Geese_)
33,VORSPIEL,
34,VORSPIEL,
35,VORSPIEL,"Geese and Lovers,"
36,VORSPIEL,Lovers and Geese!
37,VORSPIEL,Sometimes a quarrel
38,VORSPIEL,And sometimes--peace.
39,VORSPIEL,
40,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
41,VORSPIEL,
42,VORSPIEL,"Come over the sea to me, to me,"
43,VORSPIEL,Come over the sea to me!
44,VORSPIEL,"The little ships go sailing by,"
45,VORSPIEL,But never a ship brings thee!
46,VORSPIEL,
47,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
48,VORSPIEL,
49,VORSPIEL,"There were no words, if I remember,"
50,VORSPIEL,"But something subtler, deeper, Love."
51,VORSPIEL,The night it was a cold December
52,VORSPIEL,"With a shiv’ry, silver moon above--"
53,VORSPIEL,But in our hearts--the flame of love!
54,VORSPIEL,
55,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
56,VORSPIEL,
57,VORSPIEL,"The moon, the moon and a wide, blue sea,"
58,VORSPIEL,"A boat, a breeze, and you and me!"
59,VORSPIEL,
60,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
61,VORSPIEL,
62,VORSPIEL,Every night is our night.
63,VORSPIEL,"But when the moon is high,"
64,VORSPIEL,"I think the _world_ belongs to us,"
65,VORSPIEL,"The earth, the sea, the sky!"
66,VORSPIEL,
67,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
68,VORSPIEL,
69,VORSPIEL,"There are snow peaks in your heart,"
70,VORSPIEL,And a grayness that is cold.
71,VORSPIEL,"But wisdom comes with loving, sweet,"
72,VORSPIEL,And all your moods my love can meet--
73,VORSPIEL,Because my love is bold!
74,VORSPIEL,
75,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
76,VORSPIEL,
77,VORSPIEL,"Into the night we went, we two,"
78,VORSPIEL,Under the comfort of the moon.
79,VORSPIEL,The sky was pale and the poplar-trees
80,VORSPIEL,"Swayed in the wind,"
81,VORSPIEL,Swayed and swung.
82,VORSPIEL,And the dear night passed too soon!
83,VORSPIEL,
84,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
85,VORSPIEL,
86,VORSPIEL,In the twilight
87,VORSPIEL,"We parted,"
88,VORSPIEL,"In the night,"
89,VORSPIEL,"Broken-hearted,"
90,VORSPIEL,We dreamed a sweet dream.
91,VORSPIEL,Then we met and we parted
92,VORSPIEL,"Again, broken-hearted."
93,VORSPIEL,But--dreams come again!
94,VORSPIEL,
95,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
96,VORSPIEL,
97,VORSPIEL,Over the meadows--
98,VORSPIEL,To go! To go!
99,VORSPIEL,Just You and Me--
100,VORSPIEL,In the afterglow!
101,VORSPIEL,
102,VORSPIEL,[Illustration]
103,VORSPIEL,
104,VORSPIEL,The moon is the lovers’ lantern.
105,VORSPIEL,With paths of palest gold
106,VORSPIEL,She lights the lovers’ night way.
107,VORSPIEL,The moon--is never old!
