154,THE PROTAGONIST,
155,THE PROTAGONIST,I have woven of my pains a masque of bronze and the summits of my
156,THE PROTAGONIST,deepest hells are changed into the impetuous lightnings of my will and
157,THE PROTAGONIST,claws of steel have come to grow upon my mutilated members.
158,THE PROTAGONIST,
159,THE PROTAGONIST,I have violated my own graves and set the skeletons of my selves at my
160,THE PROTAGONIST,"meal-less feasting board, and still found tender meat upon their bones,"
161,THE PROTAGONIST,and the marrow of their ancient griefs was as hippocrene to me.
162,THE PROTAGONIST,
163,THE PROTAGONIST,Eternity! Infinity! I come toward thee swifter than a thought of death!
164,THE PROTAGONIST,I come toward thee bulging like a woman in her ninth month!--bulging

215,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,I travel toward a Shrine that is set in a mist--long have I been on the

217,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,I hear dull rasping whispers afloat on the night:
218,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,"Are they spirits conferring, friendly to me and my journey, or the half-smothered"
219,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,mockeries of the fiends that I know--that I know?--
220,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,They that sneer and pass on the winds in the night.
221,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,I travel toward a Shrine that is set in a mist--
222,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,By day I am beset by the beasts of my nethers and awed by the old bleached
223,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,
224,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,adavers that strew the intricate alleys of vision.
225,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,
226,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,"I peer at you, O glutton, well-fed, nigger-hipped, bag-eyed; at you I am"
227,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,"peering,"
228,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,And wonder whether the Shrine is hid in the mists of your belly--
229,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,Wondering whether the Truth be not a belch and a leer and a lusty young
230,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,wench.
231,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,"And I peer at you, too, O Gautama, the purpled renunciant, great Shadow-Eater:"
232,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,"I peer at you there on the roadside, where you sit ’neath the Bo tree, motionless,"
233,THE SHRINE IN THE MIST,"graven as death, solved in thy pulseless Nirvana--"

247,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,When a boy I was wrenched in a gin hidden in a garden of roses: thus am
248,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,I lame.
249,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,Later was slugged on the head by the Father of Lies--the Ideal:
250,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"But I laughed and hallooed, “Come, To-morrow!”"
251,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"I have been bushwhacked by women, gnawed to the bone by a great ancient"
252,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,lust:
253,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,All things I touched turned slime-green and black-hideous thoughts played
254,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,’round my night-pillow like rats ’round the new-dead:
255,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"But I laughed and hallooed, “Come, To-morrow!”"
256,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"I used to say, “God?--why, that is myself!”"
257,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"The world took me seriously, set me up for a savior:"
258,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"But I laughed, doffed aureole, and hallooed, “Come, To-morrow!”"
259,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"Then I donned horns and tail and cried, “Behold! I am Lucifer!”"
260,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,So they stoned me till I looked like a shambles:
261,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"But I laughed and hallooed, “Come, To-morrow!”"
262,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"I bought from a drab a filthy old handkerchief, exhibited it as the Veil"
263,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,of Isis.
264,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,The popes of philosophy bowed down to me and mumbled “Eureka!”
265,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"But I laughed (for I knew) and hallooed, “Come, To-morrow!”"
266,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,
267,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"Well, here am I now, a butt-end, awaiting translation."
268,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,The world I have found a small box with endless false bottoms;
269,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"I have come to the tomb, a little clay box which, too, is false bottomed:"
270,MY COMIC PERSPECTIVE,"I call into it, laugh and halloo, “Come, TO-MORROW!”"
