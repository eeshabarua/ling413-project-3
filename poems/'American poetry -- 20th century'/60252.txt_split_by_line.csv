704,PAST POET,"I wrote of roses on a woman’s breast,"
705,PAST POET,Glowing as though her blood
706,PAST POET,Had welled out to a spellbound fierceness;
707,PAST POET,"And the glad, light mixture of her hair."
708,PAST POET,I wrote of God and angels.

720,PRESENT POET,You lingered in shimmering idleness;
721,PRESENT POET,Or lengthened a prayer into a lance;
722,PRESENT POET,Or strengthened a thought till it heaved off all of life
723,PRESENT POET,And dropped its sightless heaven into your smile.

776,THE COURTESAN CHATS,"With almost no curve to his face,"
777,THE COURTESAN CHATS,And skin relentlessly white.
778,THE COURTESAN CHATS,He made me tell his fortune
779,THE COURTESAN CHATS,With a pack of cards.
780,THE COURTESAN CHATS,“Jack of hearts--your love will be
781,THE COURTESAN CHATS,A scullion overturning trays of food
782,THE COURTESAN CHATS,And standing dubiously in their midst.”
783,THE COURTESAN CHATS,“Queen of diamonds--you will have a wife
784,THE COURTESAN CHATS,"Like a thistle dipped in frost,"
785,THE COURTESAN CHATS,Helpless in your sheathed hands.”
786,THE COURTESAN CHATS,“Deuce of clubs--a downcast jester
787,THE COURTESAN CHATS,Will pester you with slanting malice
788,THE COURTESAN CHATS,When you seek to play the king.”
789,THE COURTESAN CHATS,“Ace of hearts--your life will stand
790,THE COURTESAN CHATS,"Straight in a desperate majesty,"
791,THE COURTESAN CHATS,Its lurid robes ever slipping
792,THE COURTESAN CHATS,And one wound endlessly dripping.”
793,THE COURTESAN CHATS,The passive man blew out a candle
794,THE COURTESAN CHATS,"On the table and bade me leave,"
795,THE COURTESAN CHATS,Not desiring me to see his face.

875,INSANITY,A softly clutching noise
876,INSANITY,Stumbled from the open windows.
877,INSANITY,Now and then obliquely reeling shrieks
878,INSANITY,"Rose, as though from men"

888,INSANITY,Methodically flogged the April air:
889,INSANITY,A voice that held the clashing bones
890,INSANITY,Of happiness and fear;
891,INSANITY,A voice in which emotion
892,INSANITY,Sharply ridiculed itself;
893,INSANITY,A monstrously vigorous voice
894,INSANITY,Mockingly tearing at life

1153,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,One woman gazes at another
1154,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,While twitching murder shimmers in her eyes
1155,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,And skims across her face.
1156,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Violets in a madman’s scene,"
1157,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Suspended in the air,"
1158,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Are the eyes of her neighbour.
1159,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,And in between them sits the nervous man
1160,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"With face like pouting gargoyle,"
1161,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Whose brown eyes shout the things he cannot say:
1162,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Explosive evasions;
1163,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Fears too tired to shriek;
1164,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Renunciations groaning from their dungeons.
1165,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"He eyes each woman, like a man"
1166,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Solemnly trying to walk on mysterious ice.
1167,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Crisp inanities ripple back and forth
1168,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Among these three, like ghostly parrots"
1169,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Visiting each other’s cages.
1170,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"She with crazy, violet eyes,"
1171,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Plays with her fork, as though its clink"
1172,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Rhymed with secret, chained thoughts;"
1173,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"She with murder in her eyes,"
1174,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"And curtly voluminous body,"
1175,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Evenly plays her child-rôle.
1176,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Cringing on the rim of middle age,"
1177,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"With broken shields piled at her feet,"
1178,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,She has made this man a haunted palace
1179,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,And she stands before the door
1180,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"She dare not open, with a dagger"
1181,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,For the woman standing at her side.
1182,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,
1183,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"They sit, afterwards, upon the veranda,"
1184,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Meekly greeting the velvet swagger of evening:
1185,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Woman with twisted, violet eyes,"
1186,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Woman with hidden murder on her lips,"
1187,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,And man like a pouting gargoyle.
1188,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"Then, like tired children,"
1189,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,Their words grow cool and lazy.
1190,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,They draw closer to each other
1191,BOARDING-HOUSE EPISODE,"And, with a trembling curiosity,"

1209,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,"Middle aged vaudeville conductor,"
1210,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,"With a hunted leanness on your body,"
1211,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,Sometimes the swing of your baton
1212,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,Sways with a brooding patience
1213,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,That violates your ended face.
1214,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,
1215,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,"Two acrobats appear,"
1216,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,With their automaton bows.
1217,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,Their unlit motion does not strike

1219,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,They are blue and orange corpses
1220,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,Whirled in a sacrilegious festival.
1221,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,They vividly resemble

1223,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,This lean conductor’s face:
1224,VAUDEVILLE MOMENT,"Motion without life,"

1281,I,I
1282,I,
1283,I,"This red hush toppling over the sky,"
1284,I,Wanders one step toward the stars
1285,I,And dies in a questioning shiver.
1286,I,The steel-mill chimneys fling their gaunt seeking
1287,I,A little distance into the red
1288,I,That softly combs their smoky hair.
1289,I,The steel-mill chimneys only live at night
1290,I,When crimson light makes love to them
1291,I,"And star-light trickles through the red,"
1292,I,Like glimpses of some far-off fairy tale.
1293,I,Throughout the day the steel-mill chimneys stand
1294,I,Rigidly within the wind-whirled glare:
1295,I,Only night can bring them supple straightness.
1296,I,
1297,I,
1298,II,II
1299,II,
1300,II,"From the little, brown gate that does not see them"
1301,II,"Because its eyes are blind with wooing soot,"
1302,II,An endless stream of men scatters out
1303,II,Into the cool bewilderment of morning.
1304,II,Upon their lips a limply child-like surrender
1305,II,"Curves out to the light, as though they felt"
1306,II,The presence of an unassuming strangeness.
1307,II,The morning hides from their eyes:
1308,II,"They walk on, in great strides,"
1309,II,Like blind men swinging over a well-known scene.
1310,II,Their faces twitch with echoes of iron fists:
1311,II,Their faces hold a swarthy stupor
1312,II,Loosened by little fingers of morning light
1313,II,Until it droops into reluctant life.
1314,II,"And then their eyes, made flat by night,"
1315,II,Swell into a Madonna-like surprise
1316,II,At children trooping back in huge disguise.
1317,II,The oranges in lunch-room windows change
1318,II,"To sleek suns dipped in sleepy light,"
1319,II,And rounded tarts in china plates
1320,II,"Are like red heart-beats, resting but not dead."
1321,II,A trolley-car speeds by
1322,II,And seems a strident lyric of motion.
1323,II,Wagons rumble down the street
1324,II,Like drums enticing weariness to step....
1325,II,The hearts of these steel-striding men
1326,II,"Ascend and blend within their eyes,"
1327,II,"And yet, these men are unaware of this."
1328,II,They only feel a fluid relief
1329,II,"Voicing, in a clustered roar,"
1330,II,The cries of struggling thoughts unshaped by words.
1331,II,But there are some who break forth from the rest.
1332,II,This old Hungarian strides along
1333,II,And binds naïvely-winged prayer-sandals
1334,II,Upon the heavy feet of shuffling loves.
1335,II,"Gently, he plays with his beard"
1336,II,As though his fingers touched a woman’s hair.
1337,II,And this young Slav whose surly blasphemy
1338,II,"Curls his face into a simple hate,"
1339,II,Has taken iron into his laugh
1340,II,And uses it to hew his stony mind.
1341,II,While this Italian whose deep olive skin
1342,II,"Shines like sunlight groping through dense leaves,"
1343,II,Forgets his battered happiness
1344,II,And bows with mock grace to his shouting day.
1345,II,Beside him is a fellow-countryman
1346,II,"Walking aimless, dazed with joy of motion."
1347,II,Upon his face a glistening vacancy
1348,II,Lights the mildly querying thoughts
1349,II,That seek each other but never meet.
1350,II,Behind him steps a stalwart Pole
1351,II,"Whose rhythmic, stately insolence"
1352,II,"Turns the sidewalk into a grey carpet,"
1353,II,Grey as the shades that race across his face
1354,II,And show the savage squalor of his soul.
1355,II,"Night has broken her heart upon him,"
1356,II,Only scarring his bitter smile.
1357,II,"A street of little, jack-o’-lantern houses"
1358,II,"Veering into leering saloons,"
1359,II,"Where the night, a crazy child,"
1360,II,Dips herself in sallow rouge
1361,II,And chases oaths and heavy mirth
1362,II,And even human beings:
1363,II,Where the smoky sadness of the steel-mills
1364,II,Wanders hesitantly into death
1365,II,And drops a ghostly blur upon this girl.
1366,II,"Her numbly waxen, cherub face"
1367,II,Emerges gently from the doorway’s blackness
1368,II,As though the dark had given birth to it.
1369,II,And then the falling light reveals
1370,II,That something of a village hangs about her:
1371,II,Something slumbering and ample.
1372,II,The doorway is too small to hold
1373,II,Her shoulders that are like a hill’s broad curves
1374,II,Dwindled in the distance....
1375,II,She is one of many earth-curved girls
1376,II,Who listened to the insistent tinkle
1377,II,Of wind-winged music from a far-off land:
1378,II,Listened and knew not
1379,II,That their own hearts faintly played.
1380,II,"So she ran to this far phantom,"
1381,II,Only finding it within herself
1382,II,When the city’s sly fists rained upon it.
1383,II,Then once more she fled
1384,II,With a dead heart whose restless pallor
1385,II,"Crept to squalid wantonness, for refuge."
1386,II,"And now she stands within this doorway,"
1387,II,Uttering muffled innuendoes
1388,II,To the drained men of her race.
1389,II,"Yet, something of a village hangs about her:"
1390,II,Something slumbering and ample
1391,II,Stealing from the earth curves of her shoulders.
1392,II,
1393,II,
1394,III,III
1395,III,
1396,III,"The steel-mill workers straggle down this street,"
1397,III,"Clanging shut the doorways of their souls,"
1398,III,And the sound rips their lips open.
1399,III,The steel-mill workers do not know of this:
1400,III,They only seek something that will sweeten
1401,III,The dirt that has eaten into their flesh
1402,III,And change it to raw music.
1403,III,"They straggle down this street,"
1404,III,Their faces slack and oiled with amorousness.
1405,III,"Like cats they play with their desires,"
1406,III,Biting them with little laughs
1407,III,Until the sallow houses draw them in.
1408,III,And then the night pursues their revelry:
1409,III,Echoes from the shut doors of their souls.
1410,III,
1411,III,
1412,IV,IV
1413,IV,
1414,IV,Three bent women and a child
1415,IV,Stoop before the steel-mill gate
1416,IV,As though the morning’s ghastly murmur
1417,IV,Washed against them in a wave
1418,IV,Stiffening them into resisting curves.
1419,IV,One is old and floridly misshapen.
1420,IV,"Years have melted out within her frame,"
1421,IV,Flooding her with lukewarm loves.
1422,IV,The wrinkles on her flabby face
1423,IV,Are like a faded scrawl of pain
1424,IV,Scattered by the flesh on which it rests.
1425,IV,Her frayed shawl hanging unaware of her
1426,IV,Is a symbol of her heart.
1427,IV,The woman standing at her side
1428,IV,Is tall and like a slanting scarecrow
1429,IV,Coldly jerking in the morning’s glare.
1430,IV,Only when she lifts a bony hand
1431,IV,"Tapping life against her face,"
1432,IV,Does the image disappear.
1433,IV,"Dead dreams dangle in her heart,"
1434,IV,"Limply hanging from their rainbow sashes,"
1435,IV,"And whenever one sash trembles,"
1436,IV,"Then, she lifts a gnarled hand to her face"
1437,IV,And tastes a moment of departing life.
1438,IV,Near her stands a slimly rigid woman
1439,IV,With an iron fear upon her bones.
1440,IV,A worn strait-jacket of lines
1441,IV,Cuts the dying youth upon her face.
1442,IV,"The slender child beside her,"
1443,IV,"Buried within staidly murky clothes,"
1444,IV,Glances frightenedly up at her mother:
1445,IV,Glances as one who dances to a gate
1446,IV,And fumbles for a latch that hides itself.
1447,IV,Then from the rusty-reveried steel-mill gate
1448,IV,An endless stream of men scatter out
1449,IV,Into the cool bewilderment of morning.
1450,IV,Upon their lips a limply child-like surrender
1451,IV,"Curves out to the light, as though they felt"
1452,IV,The presence of an unassuming strangeness.

1464,I,Into the poised lyric of the sky.
1465,I,"At their feet, pawn-shops and burlesque theatres"
1466,I,Yawn beneath their livid confetti.
1467,I,"In the pawn-shop windows, violins,"
1468,I,Cut-glass bowls and satchels mildly blink
1469,I,"Upon the mottled turbulence outside,"
1470,I,And sit with that detached assurance
1471,I,Gripping things inanimate.
1472,I,"Near them, slyly shaded cabarets"
1473,I,"Stand in bland and ornate sleep,"
1474,I,And the glassy luridness
1475,I,Of penny-arcades flays the eyes.

1480,II,
1481,II,Wander with me down this street
1482,II,Where the spectral night is caught
1483,II,Like moon-paint on a colourless lane....
1484,II,On this corner stands a woman
1485,II,"Sleekly, sulkily complacent"
1486,II,Like a tigress nibbling bits of sugar.
1487,II,"At her side, a brawny, white-faced man"
1488,II,"Whose fingers waltz upon his checkered suit,"
1489,II,Searches for one face amidst the crowd.
1490,II,(His smile is like a rambling sword.)
1491,II,His elbows almost touch a snowy girl
1492,II,Whose body blooms with cool withdrawal.
1493,II,From her little nook of peaceful scorn
1494,II,She casts unseeing eyes upon the crowd.
1495,II,Near her stands a weary newsboy
1496,II,With a sullenly elfin face.
1497,II,The night has leaned too intimately
1498,II,On the frightened scampering of his soul.
1499,II,"But to this old, staidly patient woman"
1500,II,"With her softly wintry eyes,"
1501,II,Night bends down in gentle revelation
1502,II,Undisturbed by joy or hatred.
1503,II,At her side two factory girls
1504,II,"In slyly jaunty hats and swaggering coats,"
1505,II,Weave a twinkling summer with their words:
1506,II,A summer where the night parades
1507,II,"Rakishly, and like a gold Beau Brummel."
1508,II,With a gnome-like impudence
1509,II,"They thrust their little, pink tongues out"
1510,II,At men who sidle past.
1511,II,"To them, the frantic dinginess of day"
1512,II,Has melted to caressing restlessness
1513,II,Tingling with the pride of breasts and hips.
1514,II,"At their side two dainty, languid girls"
1515,II,"Playing with their suavely tangled dresses,"
1516,II,Touch the black crowd with unsearching eyes.
1517,II,"But the old man on the corner,"
1518,II,Bending over his cane like some tired warrior
1519,II,"Resting on a sword, peers at the crowd"
1520,II,With the smouldering disdain
1521,II,Of a King whipped out of his domain.
1522,II,For a moment he smiles uncertainly.
1523,II,Then wears a look of frail sternness.
1524,II,
1525,II,"Musty, Rabelaisian odours stray"
1526,II,From this naïvely gilded family-entrance
1527,II,And make the body of a vagrant
1528,II,Quiver as though unseen roses grazed him.
1529,II,His face is blackly stubbled emptiness
1530,II,Swerving to the rotted prayers of eyes.
1531,II,"Yet, sometimes his thin arm leaps out"
1532,II,"And hangs a moment in the air,"
1533,II,As though he raised a violin of hate
1534,II,And lacked the strength to play it.
1535,II,A woman lurches from the family-entrance.
1536,II,With tense solicitude she hugs
1537,II,Her can of beer against her stunted bosom
1538,II,And mumbles to herself.
1539,II,The trampled blasphemy upon her face
1540,II,"Holds up, in death, its watery, barren eyes."
1541,II,"Indifferently, she brushes past the vagrant:"
1542,II,Life has peeled away her sense of touch.

1544,II,
1545,III,III
1546,III,
1547,III,"With groping majesty, the endless crowd"

1549,III,Down this tawdrily resplendent street.
1550,III,People stray into a burlesque theatre
1551,III,"Framed with scarlet, blankly rotund girls."
1552,III,Here a burly cattle-raiser walks
1553,III,With the grace of wind-swept prairie grass.
1554,III,Behind him steps a slender clerk
1555,III,Tendering his sprightly stridency
1556,III,"To the stolid, doll-like girl beside him."
1557,III,At his side a heavy youth
1558,III,Dully stands beneath his swaggering mask;
1559,III,And a smiling man in black and white
1560,III,"Walks, like some Pierrot grown middle-aged."
1561,III,
1562,III,Mutely twinkling fragments of a romance:
1563,III,Tiny lights stand over this cabaret.
1564,III,Men and women jovially emboldened
1565,III,"Stroll beneath the curtained entrance,"
1566,III,"And their laughs, like softly brazen cow-bells,"
1567,III,Change the scene to a strange Pastoral.
1568,III,"Hectic shepherdesses drunk with night,"
1569,III,Women mingle their coquettish colours....
1570,III,"Suddenly, a man leaps out"
1571,III,"From the doorway’s blazing pallor,"
1572,III,Smashing into the drab sidewalk.
1573,III,His drunken lips and eyelids break apart
1574,III,Like a clown in sudden suicide.
1575,III,Then the mottled nakedness
1576,III,"Of the scene comes, like a blow."
1577,III,
1578,III,Stoically crushed in hovering grey
1579,III,Night lies coldly on this street.
1580,III,Momentary sounds crash into night
1581,III,Like ghostly curses stifled in their birth....
1582,III,And over all the blankly box-like buildings
1583,III,Raise their sodden architecture
1584,III,Into the poised lyric of the sky.
