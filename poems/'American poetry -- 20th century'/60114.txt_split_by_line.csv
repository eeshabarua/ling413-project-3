1674,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"This vacuous, clattering spectacle"
1675,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Has collected the heart-beats of a nation.
1676,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"Greed, like a gorged Machiavelli,"
1677,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Slumps down in the green plush seat
1678,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"And wonders whether it has not blundered,"
1679,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"While a sentimental song,"
1680,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"Like a kindly infant,"
1681,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Interferes with the clink of coins.
1682,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"Hatred, juvenile and deformed,"
1683,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Earns the smirking oblivion
1684,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Of fat women mangling sound.
1685,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,The wrangling babble of ignorance
1686,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Turns to silence underneath
1687,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,The opium of innuendoes.
1688,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Acrobats appear and seem
1689,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,To be raping phantom lovers
1690,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,No longer beautiful and fresh
1691,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,But mechanically endured.
1692,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Part of the audience is also
1693,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,A battered stoic clasping worn-out mistresses.
1694,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,Clog-dancers enervate
1695,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"The thumping martyrs of their feet,"
1696,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,And chorus-girls offer the lines of their bodies
1697,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,With whining voices.
1698,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,
1699,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"Dreams are cheap, and green plush seats"
1700,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,"Appropriately, snugly hold"
1701,AMERICAN VAUDEVILLE SHOW,The expensive hallucinations.
