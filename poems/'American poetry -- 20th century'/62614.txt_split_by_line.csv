236,THE LOST CHIMES,"“Count not the cost, a thousand more or less"
237,THE LOST CHIMES,"Is not the question, but a perfect tone,"
238,THE LOST CHIMES,"A clang as clear as the Italian sky,"
239,THE LOST CHIMES,"As strong and joyful as the victor’s cry,"
240,THE LOST CHIMES,"As deep and mellow as the ocean’s moan,"
241,THE LOST CHIMES,And tender as a mother’s fond caress.”
242,THE LOST CHIMES,
243,THE LOST CHIMES,"“And let there be no stint of pure alloy,"
244,THE LOST CHIMES,"Of bronze and silver, no, not even of gold,"
245,THE LOST CHIMES,"Yea, let this be thy very master-piece,"
246,THE LOST CHIMES,"In all its making,--if it doth me please,"
247,THE LOST CHIMES,"Half of my fortune shall to thee be told,"
248,THE LOST CHIMES,And to its praise my life I shall employ.”
249,THE LOST CHIMES,
250,THE LOST CHIMES,"Thus spake Sordino, noble Florentine,"
251,THE LOST CHIMES,"To one who was renowned for casting bells,"
252,THE LOST CHIMES,"Who now was asked to make a set of chimes,"
253,THE LOST CHIMES,"A task he had accomplished many times,"
254,THE LOST CHIMES,"But this, he thought, the highest skill compels,"
255,THE LOST CHIMES,And yet the work he promised to begin.
256,THE LOST CHIMES,
257,THE LOST CHIMES,"But first for thoughts and dreams he leisure found,"
258,THE LOST CHIMES,"For consecration to the work at hand,"
259,THE LOST CHIMES,"Since this the glory of his life should be,"
260,THE LOST CHIMES,"A grand creation, a sweet symphony"
261,THE LOST CHIMES,"Of human life, which all might understand,"
262,THE LOST CHIMES,Their souls re-echoed in the liquid sound.

267,II,"He was a man of many changing moods,"
268,II,"Impetuous, like mighty Angelo,"
269,II,"And kindly, like the saintly Raphael,"
270,II,"His patience, like Palissy’s, nought could quell,"
271,II,"In worship, like the good Angelico,"
272,II,And yet the “fickled Fame” his name excludes.
273,II,
274,II,"He nature loved, and wandered oft alone"
275,II,"Mid deep recesses of some shady wood,"
276,II,"And listened to the many varied sounds,"
277,II,"From notes of birds to noise of baying hounds,"
278,II,"And oftentimes as if enraptured stood,"
279,II,Held by the music of the undertone.
280,II,
281,II,"Once had he loved a maiden, in whose eyes"
282,II,"He read the happiness of human life,"
283,II,"And mystery of the immortal soul,"
284,II,"A love to which he gave himself and all,"
285,II,"With but one aim, to win her as his wife,"
286,II,And realize his dream of Paradise.
287,II,
288,II,"But death did also mark her for his own,"
289,II,"With hectic flushes on the pallid cheek,"
290,II,And growing languor in the sprightly limbs;
291,II,"And as the day before night’s darkness dims,"
292,II,"So did her youthful buoyancy grow weak,"
293,II,"And like a vision fair, she soon was gone."
294,II,
295,II,"And sorrow, with its wintry blast did chill"
296,II,"His manly nature to the very core,"
297,II,And many months he spent in utter woe;
298,II,"But, like the flow’r which grows beneath the snow,"
299,II,A life which he had never known before
300,II,Rose from submission to the Higher Will.
301,II,
302,II,"These elements did pass into his work,"
303,II,"His love and grief, his dreams and changing moods,"
304,II,And all he was seemed mingle in the mold
305,II,"Of molten metal, and was subtly told"
306,II,By silver tonguéd bells in solitudes
307,II,"Of monastery, or of country kirk."
308,II,
309,II,
310,III,III
311,III,
312,III,As one who summons all the latent pow’r
313,III,"Within his soul, for one last great attempt"
314,III,"To reach an aim of lifelong beckoning,"
315,III,"Thus did he give himself to this one thing,"
316,III,"Began his task in spotless white, and kempt,"
317,III,Emerging from the sacramental hour.
318,III,
319,III,"He days and nights upon his labor fixed,"
320,III,"Forgetful both of hunger and of sleep,--"
321,III,His soul reflected in the fiery glow;
322,III,"And some did say, he let his life-blood flow,"
323,III,"And others, that he sometimes stopped to weep,"
324,III,And with his blood and tears the metal mixed.
325,III,
326,III,"And when at last the chimes were cast, there came"
327,III,A great collapse of utter weariness
328,III,"Upon him, and he slept for many days;"
329,III,"The finishing, with all artistic ways,"
330,III,"Was patience’s work, more like a fond caress"
331,III,Of something born of inspiration’s flame.
332,III,
333,III,"The day of testing came, the final test;"
334,III,"Sordino coming early in the morn,"
335,III,"Since eager was his soul to know for sooth,"
336,III,If its ideal of the highest truth--
337,III,"Of harmony--incarnate can be born,"
338,III,And with the works of man itself invest.
339,III,
340,III,"And when two skilful hands intoned a hymn,"
341,III,"And gave the chimes a chance for utterance,--"
342,III,"As shining on a scaffold high they hung,--"
343,III,"It seemed to him, it was by angels sung,"
344,III,"So pure, so sweet, it did his soul entrance,"
345,III,And with the tears of joy his eyes make dim.
346,III,
347,III,"The task was done, a work of perfect art;"
348,III,"And handsome was the price Sordino paid,"
349,III,"A fortune to the maker of those bells,"
350,III,"Of whom, henceforth, tradition nothing tells,"
351,III,"We know not where his future course was laid,"
352,III,Nor when or where from life he did depart.
353,III,
354,III,
355,IV,IV
356,IV,
357,IV,The chimes found their exalted place within
358,IV,"A high cathedral tow’r, Sordino’s gift"
359,IV,"To a beloved fane of Italy,"
360,IV,And that their melodies might always be
361,IV,"Within his hearing, he his home did shift"
362,IV,From country silence to the city’s din.
363,IV,
364,IV,"Where, like some voices from an unseen realm"
365,IV,Their music did announce each fleeting hour
366,IV,"To all the throngs which moved in streets below,"
367,IV,"And as their harmonies upon the air did flow,"
368,IV,They seemed to have a superhuman pow’r
369,IV,"O’er listening hearts, yea, even to overwhelm"
370,IV,The meditative mind with such a joy
371,IV,"Of loveliness and beauty, that a tear"
372,IV,Would glisten in the upward look of pray’r;
373,IV,And they would lift the heavy loads of care
374,IV,"From souls oppressed, and banish carking fear,"
375,IV,And grief and black remorse which life destroy.
376,IV,
377,IV,And thus they day and night gripped human souls
378,IV,With hope and cheer mid life’s divers pursuits;
379,IV,"But on the Sabbath and the sacred days,"
380,IV,"When man is called to think of better ways,"
381,IV,"They seemed so jubliant with heavenly truths,"
382,IV,That none did doubt that God His children calls.
383,IV,
384,IV,They had a gladness which at sundry times
385,IV,"Was almost riotous, like children’s play,"
386,IV,"And seemed to send out peals of laughter sweet,"
387,IV,"When they a merry bridal train did greet,"
388,IV,"As to the church it gaily made its way,"
389,IV,Transported with the rapture of the chimes.
390,IV,
391,IV,"But when the dead were carried to their rest,"
392,IV,"Its dirges were of all most wonderful,"
393,IV,A depth of sadness--such as none can tell--
394,IV,A sadness which the gayest did compel
395,IV,"To see a shadow of the ghastly skull,"
396,IV,And yet to feel that even the grave is blest.
397,IV,
398,IV,
399,V,V
400,V,
401,V,In all these cadences Sordino found
402,V,"A true delight, but most in solemn dirge,"
403,V,"For melancholy was his common mood,"
404,V,Though sometimes he was in an altitude
405,V,"Of such hilarity, that it did verge"
406,V,Upon the wildness of a mind unsound.
407,V,
408,V,"Indeed, the whisper passed, he was insane,"
409,V,Since only one with shattered reason could
410,V,Half of his fortune spend for such a thing:
411,V,"To hear a set of golden churchbells ring,"
412,V,And none of his few friends quite understood
413,V,His pleasure in a funeral refrain.
414,V,
415,V,"He loved to walk ’mongst tombs and ancient graves,"
416,V,"And read the epitaphs on crumbling stones,"
417,V,"Or muse beside some gloomy cypress tree,"
418,V,"While list’ning to a mournful melody,"
419,V,Mark how the harmony of all the tones
420,V,Did vanish far away o’er sunlit waves.
421,V,
422,V,"He was a seeker after harmony,"
423,V,"Such harmony in which all life shall blend,"
424,V,"In perfect peace and concord, this he heard"
425,V,Expressed in those deep tones which moved and stirred
426,V,"His brooding mind, and seemed an answer lend"
427,V,To all its questions of life’s destiny.
428,V,
429,V,Unhappiness had marred his early life;
430,V,"His marriage to a girl who loved him not,"
431,V,"And yet who lived within his childless home,"
432,V,"For binding was the tie once made by Rome,"
433,V,"Until at last her ways became a blot,"
434,V,And by her sins she ceased to be his wife.
435,V,
436,V,"Since then he lived a recluse more or less,"
437,V,"Except when boon-companions with him met,"
438,V,"To dine, or rather to a revelry,"
439,V,"When wine and music set his spirit free,"
440,V,"When he life’s disappointments could forget,"
441,V,And when some transient bliss he did caress.
442,V,
443,V,"But feasts, of such a nature, yearly grew"
444,V,"Less frequent, for his real self was good,"
445,V,"And governed him, as he in age advanced;"
446,V,"And now the chimes his being so entranced,"
447,V,That all the hunger of his heart found food
448,V,"In their sweet intonations, ever new."
449,V,
450,V,"They fed his innate philosophic bent,"
451,V,And made him delve into the subtlest lore
452,V,"Of Metaphysics and Theology,"
453,V,"That he through these, perchance, might clearer see"
454,V,"The truth which echoed from another shore,"
455,V,Each time their sovereign voice the silence rent.
456,V,
457,V,"And he waxed confident, the human cry"
458,V,"Is wafted somewhere to a higher sphere,"
459,V,"Where it is answered with a perfect peace,--"
460,V,"That not a soul from earth does find release,"
461,V,"Release from darkness and the night of fear,"
462,V,Without a morn of better hope on high.
463,V,
464,V,
465,VI,VI
466,VI,
467,VI,"The grave has, after all, the truest peace;"
468,VI,The graveyard is the greatest moralist;
469,VI,"And it was wisdom that in days of eld,"
470,VI,"The living with the dead communion held,"
471,VI,"For they did worship in their very midst,"
472,VI,A custom which in our good times must cease.
473,VI,
474,VI,No longer can we lay our dead within
475,VI,"The shadow of the church, but far away,"
476,VI,In some secluded spot where seldom seen
477,VI,"Is their last resting-place, beneath the green,"
478,VI,"Where some good farmer makes his loads of hay,"
479,VI,And murmurs that it is in places thin.
480,VI,
481,VI,"We do not, in this shallow age, endure"
482,VI,"To think of death, such thoughts do not amuse,"
483,VI,But mock the things which we are striving after;
484,VI,"It tickles not our vein of silly laughter,"
485,VI,"The subject is unpleasant and obtruse,"
486,VI,Of which the preachers even are not sure.
487,VI,
488,VI,"The graveyard, ne’ertheless, is preaching more"
489,VI,"To thinking minds than many homilies,--"
490,VI,It tells in no uncertain language of
491,VI,"The vanity in all which here we love,--"
492,VI,That all our restless seeking after bliss
493,VI,Is but the drifting to another shore.
494,VI,
495,VI,"That men and empires have their little day,"
496,VI,"Then turn to dust, as others have before,"
497,VI,"That death is still the monarch of the world,"
498,VI,"Before whose feet all things at last are hurled,"
499,VI,"Before whose realm there is no closing door,"
500,VI,"And has for all but one sad, darksome way."
501,VI,
502,VI,
503,VII,VII
504,VII,
505,VII,Of all the seasons of the year there’s none
506,VII,"To melancholy people, like the fall,"
507,VII,"That is, to persons of poetic mind,"
508,VII,For in this season they a beauty find
509,VII,"In earth and sky, which is transcending all"
510,VII,The wondrous glory of the summer gone.
511,VII,
512,VII,"For all its mellow beauty has a sadness,"
513,VII,"Twixt tears and smiles, a sadness seen and heard"
514,VII,"In nature’s varied aspects and its notes,"
515,VII,Upon the air’s dim haziness it floats:
516,VII,"The shrill cry of the migratory bird,"
517,VII,And tunes of vintage-reapers in their gladness.
518,VII,
519,VII,"’Tis in the fatal drooping of the flower,"
520,VII,"’Tis in the stubble of the fields and meads,"
521,VII,"Where crickets hold a concert day and night,"
522,VII,’Tis in the stormcloud’s shadow and its flight
523,VII,"Across the waters and the sighing reeds,"
524,VII,’Tis in the gold and crimson of the bower.
525,VII,
526,VII,’Tis in the rain that strikes against the pane
527,VII,"And leaves its diamonds on the bending straw,"
528,VII,"’Tis in the mist which follows nightly shower,"
529,VII,"A floating mantle of the Morning Hour,"
530,VII,"’Tis in the swelling brooks which onward go,"
531,VII,With mystic songs to the majestic main.
532,VII,
533,VII,"And Melancholy is the Truth, said one,"
534,VII,"Whose genius pierced through the life of man,"
535,VII,"Who hated cant, deriding the Tartuffe,"
536,VII,"And saw beneath the robe the devil’s hoof,"
537,VII,"A wandering exile from his native land,"
538,VII,"The fascinating bard, the great Byron."
539,VII,
540,VII,"Forgive, O, lustrous name, that I should use"
541,VII,Thy music for a lyre so poorly strung!
542,VII,"But I did often in my youth, even now,"
543,VII,"Admire the glory of his laurelled brow,"
544,VII,"And felt that truth and freedom ne’er was sung,"
545,VII,As by this suff’ring highpriest of the Muse.
546,VII,
547,VII,"O, all ye learned critics of his art,"
548,VII,"Who analyze by a mechanic rule,"
549,VII,"Ye fail to see the grandeur of his soul,"
550,VII,"That soared above the petty and the small,"
551,VII,"Indifferent to the existing school,"
552,VII,Preferring Pegasus to any cart.
553,VII,
554,VII,"With the sublime he ever was in tune,"
555,VII,"’Mid Alpen heights, or on “the boundless deep,”"
556,VII,"Or ’mid the storm and deaf’ning thunders crash,"
557,VII,"In darkest night, lit by the lightning’s flash,"
558,VII,"Or on the plains where vanished empires sleep,"
559,VII,Time’s desolation ’neath a waning moon.
560,VII,
561,VII,His harp did catch the minor music’s flow
562,VII,"From nature’s heart and human tragedy,"
563,VII,"And when he laughed it was the cynic’s smile,"
564,VII,"Though he at heart was tender as a child,"
565,VII,"But death to him had sweeter harmony,"
566,VII,Than life’s brief dream with its relentless woe.
567,VII,
568,VII,"Likewise Sordino, after years of thinking,"
569,VII,"Found in the dirge the acme of his search,"
570,VII,"The home-call to a truer life’s beginning,"
571,VII,"When man shall cease from sorrow and from sinning,"
572,VII,"The great, the final welcome of the church,"
573,VII,The note of peace which heav’n to earth is linking.
574,VII,
575,VII,
576,VIII,VIII
577,VIII,
578,VIII,At length there came upon Sordino’s city
579,VIII,"An enemy with armies great and strong,"
580,VIII,"And laid a siege about its buttressed walls,"
581,VIII,And since the strongest bulwark sometime falls
582,VIII,"Before a cannonading fierce, and long,"
583,VIII,"So did its self-defences, without pity."
584,VIII,
585,VIII,"The conqueror did loot and kill and ravage,"
586,VIII,"While o’er it all the chimes sang forth the hour,"
587,VIII,"In notes which shamed the horror of that day,"
588,VIII,"And as he listened said: “Take them away,"
589,VIII,"Their music hath upon my men a pow’r,"
590,VIII,Which makes a saint out of a bloody savage!”
591,VIII,
592,VIII,"Then from the lofty tow’r they were removed,"
593,VIII,"Against Sordino’s pleadings, these to spare,"
594,VIII,"And carried hence, none but the victor knew--"
595,VIII,"And captive toilers whom at last he slew,--"
596,VIII,"Their value he surmised and used such care,"
597,VIII,As for their preservation it behooved.
598,VIII,
599,VIII,
600,IX,IX
601,IX,
602,IX,"O, heinous War, Hell’s very incarnation!"
603,IX,"Whose countenance is black with darkest hate,"
604,IX,"Whose eyes have serpent’s gleam of greed and lust,"
605,IX,"And fiendish satisfaction, when the dust"
606,IX,"Of God’s fair earth with precious blood is sate,"
607,IX,Who laughs at the destruction of a nation.
608,IX,
609,IX,"Whose breath is pois’nous fumes and dire disease,"
610,IX,"And darting flames, devouring man’s abodes,"
611,IX,"Whose voice with terror fills all living things,"
612,IX,"And nought attracts except the vulture’s wings,"
613,IX,Its rending roar the very heaven goads
614,IX,Until the dark’ning cloud a-weeping flees.
615,IX,
616,IX,"Whose brutish hands, with gore and grime polluted,"
617,IX,"Are strangling innocents and ripping wombs,"
618,IX,"And gagging Virtue’s cry, and sundering"
619,IX,The maiden from her mother; plundering
620,IX,"The aged and the sick, yea, even the tombs"
621,IX,Of those “at rest” are by this monster looted.
622,IX,
623,IX,"It rules the empires, and it rules the seas,"
624,IX,"It is the prince of power in the air,"
625,IX,"And kings and nations worship it with fear,"
626,IX,"But drunk with blood they loud and wildly cheer,"
627,IX,"And think its glory great beyond compare,"
628,IX,"Yea, worth all loss and human miseries."
629,IX,
630,IX,"O, Christ, who stood on storm-tossed Galilee,"
631,IX,"Reproaching evil, saying: “Peace be still!”"
632,IX,So all the fury of the storm and wave
633,IX,"Abated, and the struggling ship was safe,"
634,IX,"Speak thou again that word divine, until"
635,IX,"The world shall hear, and war shall cease to be!"
636,IX,
637,IX,"O, may the day-spring from on High appear,"
638,IX,"When this foul monster shall be chained in Hell,"
639,IX,"When man, freed from its tyranny, shall be"
640,IX,"The blessed of the Lord, in harmony"
641,IX,"With every race which under heaven dwell,"
642,IX,And all his life be like a golden year!
643,IX,
644,IX,
645,X,X
646,X,
647,X,"Sordino from the fated city fled,"
648,X,When he beheld destruction’s hand engaged
649,X,In Vandalism on the house of God;
650,X,"It seemed to him an awful chastening-rod,"
651,X,"Because of sin which heaven had enraged,"
652,X,For which the blood of thousands now was shed.
653,X,
654,X,"When he perceived resistance was in vain,"
655,X,"The city’s doom declared in blood and fire,"
656,X,"He left it under cover of the night,"
657,X,With thousand others. Pausing in his flight
658,X,He saw the flames from the cathedral spire
659,X,Leap ’gainst the angry clouds of storm and rain.
660,X,
661,X,"He first sought safety at his country-seat,"
662,X,"A villa rich in orchard and in field,"
663,X,"Where he did shelter homeless refugees,"
664,X,"And here, for many days they lived in peace,"
665,X,"Until the country, too, itself must yield,"
666,X,And valiant men before the foe retreat.
667,X,
668,X,"We will not here relate the conflict’s trend,"
669,X,Sufficient that at last the enemy
670,X,"Was driven from the land by armies strong,"
671,X,"And as in days of the heroic song,"
672,X,"With plunder rich, across the stormy sea,"
673,X,They to their home-land shores the course did wend.
674,X,
675,X,Deep sadness fell upon Sordino’s heart
676,X,"For all the sorrow of his countrymen,"
677,X,"For all the ravages wrought by the foe,"
678,X,But most of all his cup seemed overflow
679,X,"With grief beyond the measure of our ken,"
680,X,Because he from his chimes did have to part.
681,X,
682,X,"He restless grew, no place found him content,"
683,X,"No pleasure could his spirit satisfy,"
684,X,"His former love of study him forsook,"
685,X,And e’en on nature he did cease to look
686,X,"With that true, heartfelt joy of years gone by,--"
687,X,His days in gloom and ennui were spent.
688,X,
689,X,At last he in his heart resolved to go
690,X,Upon a journey--he knew hardly where--
691,X,"In quest of his beloved bells, though none"
692,X,"For certain seemed to know where they had gone,"
693,X,"Still he would travel over land and mere,--"
694,X,With this resolve his soul was soon aglow.
695,X,
696,X,
697,XI,XI
698,XI,
699,XI,"To France he first of all did make his way,--"
700,XI,"Enduring hardship on the boistrous sea,"
701,XI,"And dangers on the shores of sullen foes,"
702,XI,But since to hearts of purpose strong no woes
703,XI,"Insufferable seem, thus agony,"
704,XI,"Of any kind, could not his zeal allay."
705,XI,
706,XI,"He reached the wondrous city of the Seine,"
707,XI,"The metropole of Europe’s art and modes,"
708,XI,"Where ever dazzling Show and Pleasure sweet,"
709,XI,"Like youths in Daphne’s grove alaughing meet,"
710,XI,"Where Grecian deities have their abodes,"
711,XI,And genius hath reared a matchless fane.[A]
712,XI,
713,XI,[A] The Louvre.
714,XI,
715,XI,"Where stands the armless Venus, unto whom"
716,XI,"Poor Heine cried for help, but none received,"
717,XI,Since pagan culture is quite impotent
718,XI,"To save a soul in doubt and error spent,"
719,XI,"Though for poor Heine none needs to be grieved,"
720,XI,Whose glory mingles with the maid of foam.
721,XI,
722,XI,"Great Paris, scene of most momentous deeds,"
723,XI,Far reaching consequences to the race;
724,XI,"Where monarchs died like vilest criminals,"
725,XI,"While Anarchy did sing her bacchanals,"
726,XI,"And trampled in the mire, what once did grace,"
727,XI,The highest places and most hallowed creeds.
728,XI,
729,XI,"Where great Napoleon, a demigod,"
730,XI,Ascended to the pinnacle of fame
731,XI,"And pow’r most dread, who made the monarchs quail"
732,XI,"Before his genius, until a wail"
733,XI,Of anguish rose mid ruin and the shame
734,XI,"Of empires, struck by heav’n’s avenging rod."
735,XI,
736,XI,But even his greatness could not have its sway
737,XI,O’er equilibriums by ages fixed;
738,XI,His life was like the wierd and dazzling light
739,XI,"Of some stray star in its erratic flight,"
740,XI,"Or like the image where the metals mixed,"
741,XI,The gold and silver with ignoble clay.
742,XI,
743,XI,"The head of gold, the feet of clay, and so"
744,XI,"The little stone of Fate the giant felled,"
745,XI,"The star erratic into exile sent,"
746,XI,"Its lustre in ignominy misspent,"
747,XI,"Still it had closed an age--whose doom was spelled,"
748,XI,"The slave is free, the tyrant, too, must go."
749,XI,
750,XI,"But this was not the France Sordino knew,"
751,XI,"Long time before the Corsican he lived,"
752,XI,"Ere France had lost her faith in monks and nuns,"
753,XI,"While chiming bells were more than roaring guns,"
754,XI,"And in their potency the land believed,"
755,XI,Rejoicing that their fathers’ faith was true.
756,XI,
757,XI,"His life fell in the days of Charles the Great,"
758,XI,"When wars were pleasant pastime for the kings,"
759,XI,"Who fought for many reasons quite terrestrial,"
760,XI,"But sometimes, as they thought, for things celestial,"
761,XI,"And nothing like the latter valor brings,"
762,XI,Inspired by bigotry and hellish hate.
763,XI,
764,XI,"When France was warring for her very life,"
765,XI,"And Guise, the mighty lion, held at bay,"
766,XI,"When Florence beat her foe at Marciano,"
767,XI,"And poor Sordino lost his sweet campana,"
768,XI,’Twas in that age he lived and made his way
769,XI,"To Paris, weary from the worldly strife."
770,XI,
771,XI,"He traveled like a scholar, incognito,"
772,XI,"And sought the company of learned men,"
773,XI,Disputing with them in the classic lore;
774,XI,"This helped him churchly places to explore,"
775,XI,"Where might have been, perchance, a robber’s den,"
776,XI,Since that of old has ever had a ditto.
777,XI,
778,XI,"“My Father’s house ye made a den of thieves,”"
779,XI,"Said Christ to priests who wrought for Him a cross,"
780,XI,"But afterwards, full often, in His name"
781,XI,The priesthood has been guilty of the same:
782,XI,"What was a sister nation’s grievous loss,"
783,XI,They proudly stored in dusky sacristies.
784,XI,
785,XI,"Such was the plunder of the noble art,"
786,XI,"Which Philip from the Netherlands did take,"
787,XI,"Such, too, the treasures which Napoleon"
788,XI,With ruthless warfare from the nations won;
789,XI,"Thus ever, where the priest his sign doth make"
790,XI,Upon the sin which pierced the sacred heart.
791,XI,
792,XI,"Such guilt may, even in Sordino’s times,"
793,XI,"Have rested upon some Parisian church,"
794,XI,"Or abbey in its strange seclusiveness,"
795,XI,"But everywhere he found but weariness,"
796,XI,"Resulting from his all persistent search,"
797,XI,And nowhere did he see nor hear his chimes.
798,XI,
799,XI,
800,XII,XII
801,XII,
802,XII,Why should a soul consume its power and peace
803,XII,"In quest of that which useless seems and vague,"
804,XII,"In following mirages of ideals,"
805,XII,"And pass through many harassing ordeals,"
806,XII,"Endure the cruel sneer of mobs that plague,"
807,XII,When one may dwell ’mongst them in mental ease?
808,XII,
809,XII,"Why follow, like a fettered slave, one’s longing"
810,XII,"Which sometimes leads through dun and dreary wilds,"
811,XII,"O’er pathless hills and mountain tops afar,"
812,XII,"And then points to a dim and distant star,"
813,XII,"With faith a-smiling, like a little child’s,"
814,XII,While spectral shadows round one’s soul is thronging?
815,XII,
816,XII,Because a gleam--as from a fiery globe--
817,XII,"Illumined souls before their incarnation,"
818,XII,"And bound them with love’s chain eternally,"
819,XII,"That Beauty’s face for ever they might see,"
820,XII,"And ne’er be happy in their earthly station,"
821,XII,Unless their life in heav’n’s pure light they robe.
822,XII,
823,XII,This gleam was ever glowing in the heart
824,XII,"Of him whom men might say was “lacking sense,”"
825,XII,The light of beauty and a smould’ring love.--
826,XII,"Since strait-laced folk may now his acts reprove,"
827,XII,"And fearing this, we shall the tale condense,"
828,XII,"Of what took place, before he did depart."
829,XII,
830,XII,"One day he met a scholar from Vienna,"
831,XII,"Whose home was on the banks of that fair stream,"
832,XII,"Renowned in history and minstrel’s song,"
833,XII,"O’er whose blue waters, as they flow along,"
834,XII,"Some olden romance hovers like a dream,"
835,XII,In saffron hues of terra di Sienna.
836,XII,
837,XII,There traveled with this scholar a young woman
838,XII,"Whose beauty smote Sordino at first sight,"
839,XII,And made him captive unaware; how strange!
840,XII,"Since he had thought himself outside the range,"
841,XII,"Now two score ten, ev’n of the wildest flight"
842,XII,Of any arrow from the little bow-man.
843,XII,
844,XII,"But such is man, who thinks, he knows himself,"
845,XII,"And--like Sordino--very much besides,"
846,XII,"Quite fortified by wisdom’s splendid armor,"
847,XII,"Who thinks his heart is dead to any charmer,"
848,XII,Will suddenly discover that there hides
849,XII,Within its chambers still a little elf.
850,XII,
851,XII,"She was a coy, elusive little creature,"
852,XII,"Uncaptured yet by suitors manifold,"
853,XII,"Her father’s only child, and motherless,"
854,XII,"Whose cheerfulness his saddened heart did bless,"
855,XII,"Whose eyes of Danube blue and hair of gold,"
856,XII,Commingled with her Mother’s Grecian feature.
857,XII,
858,XII,"She was proficient in the classic learning,"
859,XII,"Read Greek and Latin like her native tongue,"
860,XII,"Italian, too, and did on Dante dote,"
861,XII,"And metaphysics studied, but by rote,"
862,XII,"For mental subtleties she was too young,"
863,XII,And was to Hella’s songs too often turning.
864,XII,
865,XII,Anacreon she knew by heart and set
866,XII,"His lyric and erotic odes to tunes,"
867,XII,And most of all she did with fondness love
868,XII,His ἐραςμίη πέλεια--the dove
869,XII,"Of Venus, odorous with sweet perfumes,"
870,XII,Her payment for the poet’s canzonet.
871,XII,
872,XII,"And like an Amathusia she seemed,"
873,XII,"To fond Sordino, who had ne’er beheld"
874,XII,"Such loveliness of mind and body wed,"
875,XII,And then he knew that ’mid the past and dead
876,XII,"Of his own life, no being had compelled"
877,XII,His love like she whom he a goddess deemed.
878,XII,
879,XII,"But when he saw her father’s jealous care,"
880,XII,"He did not dare his hand to tender her,"
881,XII,But first of all sought to ingratiate
882,XII,"Himself to both, but most to the sedate,"
883,XII,"Pedantic scholar, ready to concur"
884,XII,"In all his views, though fallacy lay bare."
885,XII,
886,XII,"Thus suavity did win the learned man,"
887,XII,"And he became Sordino’s ardent friend,"
888,XII,"And asked him to return with them to Wien,"
889,XII,"Another thing he failed not to agree in,"
890,XII,"And when their stay in Paris had an end,"
891,XII,He gladly journeyed with this Austrian.
892,XII,
893,XII,
894,XIII,XIII
895,XIII,
896,XIII,"On Danube’s shores, ’mid wooded hills, a villa"
897,XIII,"Was smiling welcome to its lord and guest,"
898,XIII,"But most of all to her--whose name was Stella,"
899,XIII,(Her father called her “pulchra me’ puella”)
900,XIII,"For whom the servants ready had ein Fest,"
901,XIII,Where once encamped the hosts of Attila.
902,XIII,
903,XIII,"A Florentine among Teutonic scenes,"
904,XIII,"Led thither by a love, yet unexpressed,"
905,XIII,"Forgot his sorrows, yea, forgot his bells,"
906,XIII,Since nought like love its victim so compels
907,XIII,"To full submission to a sweet behest,"
908,XIII,The looks and smiles of one still in her teens.
909,XIII,
910,XIII,"Her beauty was the centre of all scenes,"
911,XIII,"Her voice the only music of each sound,"
912,XIII,"Her presence, sole embodiment of bliss,"
913,XIII,"And heaven itself it would have been, a kiss,"
914,XIII,"For which the Shibboleth he had not found,"
915,XIII,Behind the garden-trees and flow’ry screens.
916,XIII,
917,XIII,On horseback did they sometimes ride along
918,XIII,"The winding roads, and most in early morn,"
919,XIII,"While yet the dew was trembling on the blade,"
920,XIII,And all the minstrelsy of dreamy glade
921,XIII,"Was like a stream Elysian to them borne,"
922,XIII,"With pure delight, estranged to earthly wrong."
923,XIII,
924,XIII,And sometimes on the noble river’s breast
925,XIII,"They sailed, below the stately castle walls,"
926,XIII,"Or hoary ruins on o’erhanging cliffs,"
927,XIII,"Of ancient lore the sacred hieroglyphs,"
928,XIII,"Upon whose mystery the moonlight falls,"
929,XIII,With fairy-charm which age of knighthood blessed.
930,XIII,
931,XIII,’Mongst such are those of famous Dürrenstein
932,XIII,"Which once imprisoned Richard Lionhearted,--"
933,XIII,"Returning from a holy pilgrimage,--"
934,XIII,"The English lion in an unknown cage,--"
935,XIII,"For ev’n his minstrel, from whom he had parted,"
936,XIII,Knew not what walls his good lord did confine.
937,XIII,
938,XIII,"But he, the faithful Blondel, sought him long,"
939,XIII,"And traveled in disguise through Germany,"
940,XIII,"Until he learned of some great personage,"
941,XIII,"On whom king Leopold had wreaked his rage,"
942,XIII,"And now he sought this place most eagerly,"
943,XIII,"Without an aid or weapon, but a song."
944,XIII,
945,XIII,"A song which he, together with the king,"
946,XIII,"Had made one night among Judean hills,"
947,XIII,"A ballad full of stirring battle-scenes,"
948,XIII,"Of Crusaders in strife with Saracens,"
949,XIII,"Of victories, defeats and untold ills,"
950,XIII,And this below the tow’r he now did sing.
951,XIII,
952,XIII,And in the stillness of the summer night
953,XIII,"His voice rose clear up to the battlement,"
954,XIII,"But none did deem it but a common lay,"
955,XIII,Except the one who watched a flick’ring ray
956,XIII,"Of one bright star, to him the song’s ascent"
957,XIII,Came like God’s angels on the gleam of light.
958,XIII,
959,XIII,"He reached the middle of his song and ceased,"
960,XIII,"Then harkened for an answer from the tow’r,"
961,XIII,When all at once he heard his master’s voice
962,XIII,"Conclude the lay, it made his heart rejoice."
963,XIII,"He homeward sped, and soon a ransom’s power"
964,XIII,The monarch from captivity released.
965,XIII,
966,XIII,"This story Stella told the Florentine,"
967,XIII,"Who found it charming in her quaint Italian,"
968,XIII,But would have substituted some fair lady
969,XIII,"For doughty Richard, though perhaps more shady,"
970,XIII,"If held a ransom by a noble villain,"
971,XIII,Found by her lover while she did repine.
972,XIII,
973,XIII,"A thing she disagreed with very strongly,"
974,XIII,"Since heroes she preferred to amorettes,"
975,XIII,"And poets, singing monarchs out of prison,"
976,XIII,To luting minstrels whose life’s mission
977,XIII,"Is sentimental ditties and regrets,"
978,XIII,Though she in heart felt this was stated wrongly.
979,XIII,
980,XIII,"And such is, after all, a maiden’s heart,"
981,XIII,"Unknown to her, unsearchable to man,"
982,XIII,"It quotes one thing, while feeling quite another,"
983,XIII,"Though guileless like a sister to her brother,"
984,XIII,Her head and heart are like a sprightly span
985,XIII,Of untrained colts which ever pull apart.
986,XIII,
987,XIII,"But we must shun continuous digression,"
988,XIII,"And turn to him, the hero of our tale,"
989,XIII,"Who made the rather sad discovery,"
990,XIII,"That Stella ne’ertheless did worship Chivalry,"
991,XIII,"But not in men of fifty, though all hale,"
992,XIII,For he received a “No” to his confession.
993,XIII,
994,XIII,"Her heart cleaved to a youth in far off land,"
995,XIII,"A youth of prowess in her country’s cause,"
996,XIII,"Though not bethrothed, she hoped the day would come,"
997,XIII,"When that should be, ev’n in her father’s home,"
998,XIII,"This to Sordino a great sorrow was,"
999,XIII,Since he had hoped to win her heart and hand.
1000,XIII,
1001,XIII,"He said adieu to these his friends, by chance,"
1002,XIII,"And drew away, he cared but little whither,"
1003,XIII,"Since wounded love has lost its grip on life,"
1004,XIII,"And sees it like a night with horror rife,"
1005,XIII,"Until the victim on some morning blither,"
1006,XIII,Does damn such meetings as that one in France.
1007,XIII,
1008,XIII,"For men at fifty may as truly love,"
1009,XIII,"As boys of fifteen, and a little truer,"
1010,XIII,"And, disappointed, feel the keenest pang,"
1011,XIII,But yet I have not heard a suitor hang
1012,XIII,"Himself, because he flatly failed to woo her,"
1013,XIII,"Nor worth the while with rivals, have a row."
1014,XIII,
1015,XIII,"For wisdom grows with years, and manly reason"
1016,XIII,"Becomes the load-star of the wanderer,"
1017,XIII,"And man doth cease to be a woman’s slave,"
1018,XIII,For which she may despise him as a knave;
1019,XIII,"The “superman” she made, doth ponder her,"
1020,XIII,"And knows, beneath her love is sometimes treason."
1021,XIII,
1022,XIII,
1023,XIV,XIV
1024,XIV,
1025,XIV,Vienna has a noble shrine; ev’n then
1026,XIV,"It vied in glory with all Europe’s fanes,"
1027,XIV,"St. Stephen;--thither did he go one day,"
1028,XIV,"To see its beauty, more perchance, to pray,"
1029,XIV,For he would fain seek solace ’mongst the manes
1030,XIV,Of the departed than the crowds of men.
1031,XIV,
1032,XIV,There in the dimness of the lofty nave
1033,XIV,"He tarried long and mused upon the past,"
1034,XIV,On visored knights who thither came to find
1035,XIV,"Forgiveness, and assurance to their mind,"
1036,XIV,That God did sanction that their lot was cast
1037,XIV,With them who fought for the Redeemer’s grave.
1038,XIV,
1039,XIV,"Their sacred task he almost envied them,"
1040,XIV,To have a noble aim and be assured
1041,XIV,"That heaven its benediction on it smiles,"
1042,XIV,"And loving hearts are with the weary miles,"
1043,XIV,"For such a quest all things might be endured,"
1044,XIV,And death itself be life’s great diadem.
1045,XIV,
1046,XIV,A mission and a woman’s love is all
1047,XIV,"A man should crave for earthly happiness,"
1048,XIV,"Sordino thought, while absently his gaze"
1049,XIV,"Did fall upon the sweet Madonna’s face,"
1050,XIV,And he had none of these to lift and bless
1051,XIV,"His aimless, dark and love-tormented soul."
1052,XIV,
1053,XIV,"He humbly knelt before the ancient altar,"
1054,XIV,"A stranger mid the holy solitude,"
1055,XIV,But what he said in pray’r must not be told
1056,XIV,"To all the world, whose cynic smile is cold;"
1057,XIV,Sufficient that the Saviour on the Rood
1058,XIV,Imparted strength to him who seemed to falter.
1059,XIV,
1060,XIV,"Just then a clear-tongued bell rang from the tower,"
1061,XIV,"With notes akin to one of his lost chimes,"
1062,XIV,Reminding him of his neglected quest;
1063,XIV,"He rose as if by a new zeal possest,"
1064,XIV,"As when a mountaineer, who upward climbs,"
1065,XIV,Is fascinated by the vision’s power.
1066,XIV,
1067,XIV,
1068,XV,XV
1069,XV,
1070,XV,"That night he had a dream, in which he heard"
1071,XV,"The music of his bells across the seas,"
1072,XV,"Whose notes came clearly from a purple haze,"
1073,XV,"And wandered with the breeze from place to place,"
1074,XV,"A-dancing with the billows’ wild caprice,"
1075,XV,And mingled with the cries of many a bird.
1076,XV,
1077,XV,"And floated round a many-colored sail,"
1078,XV,"Half-hoisted, flapping, listening between,"
1079,XV,"And eager to depart for that fair land,"
1080,XV,"Whence came the music, on whose purple strand"
1081,XV,"The ocean shifted from the dazzling sheen,"
1082,XV,To emerald and amethystine pale.
1083,XV,
1084,XV,"And in the stern the smiling Stella stood,"
1085,XV,"A-beckoning to come with her away,"
1086,XV,"And he did hasten to the rocky shore,"
1087,XV,"But as he reached it, she was there no more,"
1088,XV,"The ship had carried her far out the bay,"
1089,XV,And in its wake the waves were red as blood.
1090,XV,
1091,XV,"Then did he weep, until a gentle hand"
1092,XV,"Was laid upon his head, now bending low,"
1093,XV,"And looking up, a stranger met his eye,"
1094,XV,"Who said: “Why art thou here, why dost thou cry?"
1095,XV,"The melodies which o’er the waters go,"
1096,XV,Proceed from chimes made in thy native land;
1097,XV,"Thy own they are, go seek them till thou findest,"
1098,XV,"Then is thy journey ended, and the strife,"
1099,XV,"Then shalt thou know the joy which heaven will give,"
1100,XV,So overwhelming that thou canst not live;
1101,XV,"Now, henceforth thou must sacrifice thy life,"
1102,XV,To those who bear the cross our God is kindest.”
1103,XV,
1104,XV,"When from his dream he woke, he pondered long"
1105,XV,"Its meaning, and at last waxed confident,"
1106,XV,It was an angel that had spoken thus;
1107,XV,"For calling in distress, God heareth us,"
1108,XV,"His unseen ministers to us are sent,"
1109,XV,"To give us light, and weeping change to song."
1110,XV,
1111,XV,"He also felt assured, his chimes had found"
1112,XV,"A place across the seas, though not in France,"
1113,XV,"May be in England or some British isle,--"
1114,XV,"This thought provoked a melancholy smile,"
1115,XV,"For Richard’s fame and knightly lance,"
1116,XV,And Blondel’s song were with it bound.
1117,XV,
1118,XV,"And he determined to depart full soon,"
1119,XV,"Yet one thing did his heart desire to see,--"
1120,XV,"The face of Stella, which both night and day"
1121,XV,"Did follow him, where-e’er he turned his way,"
1122,XV,Her beck’ning in his dream might mean to be
1123,XV,"A change of mind, before another moon."
1124,XV,
1125,XV,"Yea, might he but behold those eyes once more,"
1126,XV,"Receive again one look of kindliness,"
1127,XV,"And feast his famished heart upon her beauty,"
1128,XV,"And hear her speak, as once, forgetting duty,"
1129,XV,"And give him one adieu of hope to bless,"
1130,XV,Then would he seek his chimes on any shore.
1131,XV,
1132,XV,
1133,XVI,XVI
1134,XVI,
1135,XVI,How man is ever living by illusions!
1136,XVI,"The more the better, why then shatter them?"
1137,XVI,Why kill the birds of Paradise with science?
1138,XVI,"Why meet old Superstition with defiance,"
1139,XVI,Since in the past her very garments’ hem
1140,XVI,Gave from life’s guiltiness sweet absolution?
1141,XVI,
1142,XVI,"Why not let lore of Middle Ages reign,"
1143,XVI,The lore of fairy--and of elfin-land?
1144,XVI,"A world of strange, imaginary things,"
1145,XVI,"Which gave to human mind its soaring wings,"
1146,XVI,"And bore the simplest to a golden strand,"
1147,XVI,Where he forgot his poverty and pain.
1148,XVI,
1149,XVI,"What are your knowledge and inventions worth,"
1150,XVI,"If they destroy man’s fleeting happiness,--"
1151,XVI,"Illusion’s chiefest offspring, and life’s goal?"
1152,XVI,Far better then the hut and back-log coal
1153,XVI,"Than mansions lighted by the magic press,"
1154,XVI,But without fairies and a glowing hearth.
1155,XVI,
1156,XVI,Sordino’s age was not like ours--of engines;
1157,XVI,"No Kipling to bid romance a farewell,"
1158,XVI,"No wonders in the realm of rods and wheels,"
1159,XVI,"No squeaking phonographs and Chaplin reels,"
1160,XVI,"No railroads, autos, and, what was as well,"
1161,XVI,"No Zeppelins, no bombs and submarines."
1162,XVI,
1163,XVI,"His was the vanished day of simple living,"
1164,XVI,"Of child-like faith in man, and things unseen,"
1165,XVI,"When next God’s footstool poet, prophet stood,"
1166,XVI,"And told that all which makes man glad is good,"
1167,XVI,"That ever Eden’s Tree of Life is green,"
1168,XVI,And to the world its leaves of healing giving.
1169,XVI,
1170,XVI,"And such a leaf was any happy dream,--"
1171,XVI,"An omen or a message from beyond,"
1172,XVI,"As truly as in good Hellenic days,"
1173,XVI,"When at the Sibyl’s cave men found their ways,--"
1174,XVI,And to Sordino its illusion fond
1175,XVI,"Became a prophecy, a guiding gleam."
1176,XVI,
1177,XVI,
1178,XVII,XVII
1179,XVII,
1180,XVII,"A Catholic he was and had his passport,"
1181,XVII,"And did not fear to take a ship for London,"
1182,XVII,"Though rumor owned it, things were lively there,"
1183,XVII,"And travellers had better take a care,"
1184,XVII,"Where “Bloody Mary” ruled with fierce abandon,"
1185,XVII,Suspecting strangers to be of the base sort.
1186,XVII,
1187,XVII,"The base sort being chiefly protestant,"
1188,XVII,Or sympathizers with the cause of Cranmer;
1189,XVII,"And since he was not either, he might venture"
1190,XVII,"To see the city without fearing censure,"
1191,XVII,"And so, at last, he started out to wander"
1192,XVII,"Through Germany, whose scenes did him enchant."
1193,XVII,
1194,XVII,"At last he reached the port of old Calais,"
1195,XVII,"And bought a passage ’cross the English Channel,"
1196,XVII,"According as the angel had him bidden,"
1197,XVII,Believing that his chimes were used or hidden
1198,XVII,"In London town, where back of pane or panel"
1199,XVII,He’d seek and find them on some happy day.
1200,XVII,
1201,XVII,"Now as the wind bore gently ’gainst the sail,"
1202,XVII,"And slowly eked their distance from the shore,"
1203,XVII,"The western sun lay ruddy on the wave,"
1204,XVII,"His dream thereby made real, all things, save"
1205,XVII,"The one whose face his heart did still adore,"
1206,XVII,She was not there this pilgrim strange to hail.
1207,XVII,
1208,XVII,"Upon him fell a sadness, which alone"
1209,XVII,"The homeless, longing traveller doth know,"
1210,XVII,"Augmented by a disappointed love,"
1211,XVII,"And standing musing at the vessel’s prow,"
1212,XVII,"The only thing his wistful vision saw,"
1213,XVII,Was that red glow which on the water shone.
1214,XVII,
1215,XVII,"He stood there when the evening shadows fell,"
1216,XVII,"And darkening storm-clouds rose o’er England’s coast,"
1217,XVII,He stood there when the night closed from his view
1218,XVII,"The shores of France, within the deepest blue,"
1219,XVII,"Through which a glim’ring light, the uttermost,"
1220,XVII,Was smiling him a dubious farewell.
1221,XVII,
1222,XVII,"He stood there when the waves began to roll,"
1223,XVII,"The wind to sigh and whine in sail and rope,"
1224,XVII,And night closed round him with forebodings dark
1225,XVII,"Of dangers for the rocking little bark,"
1226,XVII,"On which full many souls now stayed their hope,"
1227,XVII,That it would bear them to their journey’s goal.
1228,XVII,
1229,XVII,"But he feared not, no, rather pleasure found"
1230,XVII,"In the arising fury of the deep,"
1231,XVII,"Since it expressed the sorrow of his soul,"
1232,XVII,"And he did hear its wild alluring call,"
1233,XVII,"Into its mystic rest at once to leap,"
1234,XVII,A rest beneath the billows’ angry sound.
1235,XVII,
1236,XVII,And now the elements did more and more
1237,XVII,Unstop their many-voiced organ-keys:
1238,XVII,"The thunder’s loud diapason, the shriek"
1239,XVII,"Of wailing wind, the flopping and the creak"
1240,XVII,"Of rigging; and the rain upon the seas,"
1241,XVII,The lightning’s hiss and surging water’s roar.
1242,XVII,
1243,XVII,"But all of this his heart enjoyed with glee,"
1244,XVII,"And he refused to leave his lonely post,"
1245,XVII,"Though drenched, and clinging to the vessel’s railing,"
1246,XVII,"A good old ship, though sorely tried, yet sailing,"
1247,XVII,"It was her sturdy captain’s boast,"
1248,XVII,That she could weather even the roughest sea.
1249,XVII,
1250,XVII,Sordino heard in all the symphony
1251,XVII,"Of nature’s stormy mood, the misery"
1252,XVII,"And rage pent up in her great heart, like his,"
1253,XVII,"Thus all its terror was to him a bliss,"
1254,XVII,"He heard in it majestic melody,"
1255,XVII,Since all God’s universe is harmony.
1256,XVII,
1257,XVII,The wind grew chilly and at last him drove
1258,XVII,"Into the hold, where slumber soon him claimed;"
1259,XVII,"And when the morning dawned, the ship was near"
1260,XVII,The cliffs of England; this a grateful tear
1261,XVII,"Brought from the anxious hearts, which almost shamed"
1262,XVII,Sordino whom this sight left quite unmoved.

1270,XVIII,"Where Freedom sits with monarchs on their throne,"
1271,XVIII,"Where truth, more precious than the ruddy gold,"
1272,XVIII,Is by her wise men fearlessly professed.
1273,XVIII,
1274,XVIII,"Where he, the many-minded genius"
1275,XVIII,"Arose to make her name and tongue immortal,"
1276,XVIII,"With never dying characters and song,"
1277,XVIII,"Who knew the soul among the vulgar throng,"
1278,XVIII,"As well as that of kings in castle portal,"

1282,XVIII,"The child of ages, product of a race,"

1284,XVIII,"To a new day, its rusty fetters breaking,--"
1285,XVIII,"He with his torch showed it the better ways,"
1286,XVIII,And linked the new with ancient fairy-story.
1287,XVIII,
1288,XVIII,"Sordino’s times were all with forces seething,"
1289,XVIII,"The new and old at war for mastery,"
1290,XVIII,"But through its hope and fear, its love and hating,"
1291,XVIII,"The nation with its rulers vacillating,"
1292,XVIII,"There came the age when light gained victory,"
1293,XVIII,And Freedom through the songs of Shakespear breathing.
1294,XVIII,
1295,XVIII,"That Freedom then, as ever, bathed in blood,"
1296,XVIII,"And tried by fiery fagot and the stake,"
1297,XVIII,"The Freedom of the soul to trow and live,"
1298,XVIII,"As Christ commanded, ev’n that men should give--"

1301,XVIII,
1302,XVIII,The voice of Freedom whispered through the world--
1303,XVIII,"Like quick’ning breezes of advancing Spring,"
1304,XVIII,"Which wake the modest crocus ’mongst the hills,"
1305,XVIII,"And violets along the laughing rills,"
1306,XVIII,And bid returning songster’s music ring
1307,XVIII,Through budding woodlands by the mist impearled.
1308,XVIII,
1309,XVIII,"Thus Freedom’s voice did wake the souls of men,"
1310,XVIII,"The lowly and the mighty felt its power,"
1311,XVIII,"But most the pure in heart who saw their God,"
1312,XVIII,Their hearts rejoiced ev’n ’neath the scourging rod;

1319,XIX,Sordino came to London just in time
1320,XIX,"To view a drama, not unseldom seen"
1321,XIX,"By Englishmen in Mary Tudor’s reign,"
1322,XIX,Who left upon her country’s page a stain
1323,XIX,So dark and bloody that scarce any queen
1324,XIX,Has ever steeped her rule in fouler crime.
1325,XIX,
1326,XIX,"From Newgate prison, in the early morn,"
1327,XIX,"An old decrepit man was rudely led,"
1328,XIX,"Amid the gibes and scoffings of a mob,"
1329,XIX,Which drowned the words of pity and the sob;
1330,XIX,Abuses fell upon his hoary head;
1331,XIX,But for his Master they were gladly borne.
1332,XIX,
1333,XIX,"They brought him to an open square, where stood"
1334,XIX,"An upright stake with iron rings and chains,"
1335,XIX,"Awaiting his frail body to entwine,"
1336,XIX,"And round about were twigs of birch and pine,"
1337,XIX,"Piled up in bundles, groaning with the pains,"
1338,XIX,They should inflict on one whose life was good.
1339,XIX,
1340,XIX,"The rising sun cast on the earth a soft,"
1341,XIX,"Warm, trembling light, God’s Cherubim who told"
1342,XIX,To all whose soul had vision: “He is Love;”
1343,XIX,"At least one marked it, smiled and looked above,"
1344,XIX,"Into infinity of blue and gold,"
1345,XIX,"And as his eyes were lifted thus aloft,"
1346,XIX,
1347,XIX,"He said: “What profit hath a man, if he"
1348,XIX,Should gain the entire world and lose his soul?
1349,XIX,What can he give for it in true exchange?
1350,XIX,"This is the truth which saves or doth avenge,"
1351,XIX,"And now as I am here to give my all,"
1352,XIX,I thank thee Father for the Victory.”
1353,XIX,
1354,XIX,"A pray’r which followed was by clamor drowned,"
1355,XIX,"The torch applied set loose the crackling flame,"
1356,XIX,"Which leaped about his limbs and to his face,"
1357,XIX,"Extinguishing the glory of his gaze,"
1358,XIX,And silencing the lisping of His name
1359,XIX,Who hath with immortality him crowned.

1363,XX,
1364,XX,"I said, Sordino was a Catholic,"
1365,XX,"But more than that, a true philosopher,"
1366,XX,And at this sight within himself he mused:
1367,XX,“How is the Gospel of the Christ abused
1368,XX,"By those who should its saving love confer,"
1369,XX,Upon a world with sin and hatred sick!”
1370,XX,
1371,XX,"“The light of love changed into flames of hell,"
1372,XX,"The praise of joy to wails of agony,"
1373,XX,"The cross into a fetish of dark fear,"
1374,XX,"Around the which the fiendish demons leer,"
1375,XX,"While erring souls are shackled to the tree,"
1376,XX,And fagots blaze amid the rabble’s yell.”
1377,XX,
1378,XX,“How terrible is zeal without true knowledge;
1379,XX,"How awful bigotry, born by religion!"
1380,XX,"How black is priestcraft, bred by selfishness,"
1381,XX,Before whose judgment-seat there’s no redress
1382,XX,For any sympathizer with rebellion
1383,XX,Against the schemes of Jesuitic college!”
1384,XX,
1385,XX,His tender-heartedness aroused such thought;--
1386,XX,"He paused, and crossed himself, perhaps he sinned,--"
1387,XX,"In thinking thus, and carried thus away"
1388,XX,"By that sad spectacle, and then did say,"
1389,XX,"Within himself: “May be the fellow grinned,"
1390,XX,Because his faith a glory to him brought.”
1391,XX,
1392,XX,“Was that the motive which led him to suffer?
1393,XX,Then was he despicable more than they
1394,XX,"Who brazed themselves his dirty flesh to fry,"
1395,XX,"Then was his smoke a stench beneath the sky,"
1396,XX,"His ashes unfit for his country’s clay,"
1397,XX,"He, not a martyr, but a worthless duffer.”"
1398,XX,
1399,XX,"“If pride, quite obstinate, of fancied light,"
1400,XX,"Diviner, truer than of mother church,"
1401,XX,"Did actuate the Protestants to die,"
1402,XX,"Then there is justice in the people’s cry,"
1403,XX,"For such an arrogance the truth will smirch,"
1404,XX,And rob its scepter of celestial right.”
1405,XX,
1406,XX,"Thus did philosopher and churchman speak,"
1407,XX,And now the poet whispered: “Peace be still!
1408,XX,Where are thy chimes? All England needs their tone
1409,XX,Of harmony to make the people one;
1410,XX,Thy golden chimes! At last their music will
1411,XX,Interpret all which men through suff’ring seek.”

1415,XXI,
1416,XXI,"Pained and disgusted with the sight, he passed"
1417,XXI,Out of the city--’twas not very far
1418,XXI,Before he struck the open country-road--
1419,XXI,"Which led to Shoreditch church, and meadows broad,"
1420,XXI,"And fields of golden grain, where nought did mar"
1421,XXI,The peace of all that was with nature classed.
1422,XXI,
1423,XXI,"Amid a field, below a hillock’s slope,"
1424,XXI,"He saw a man at work, also a lad,"
1425,XXI,"With sickles in their hands, a-cutting grain,"
1426,XXI,"He stopped and looked at them, the boy with pain"
1427,XXI,"Seemed, raise himself, when he a bundle had"
1428,XXI,"Completed, trying with his sire to cope."
1429,XXI,
1430,XXI,"And while he stretched his aching, weary back,"
1431,XXI,"He gazed across the field with longing look,"
1432,XXI,A-measuring how many days ’twould take
1433,XXI,"To reach the end--the field’s dividing stake,"
1434,XXI,Then spit into his hands and firmly took
1435,XXI,His place behind his father’s cleancut track.
1436,XXI,
1437,XXI,"This incident Sordino much impressed,"
1438,XXI,"He read at once the feelings of the boy,"
1439,XXI,"That not alone in body, but in mind"
1440,XXI,"He suffered, sought deliverance to find,"
1441,XXI,"And so he said: “I will the lad employ,"
1442,XXI,I need a guide whom heav’n with dreams hath blessed.”
1443,XXI,
1444,XXI,"The father would not listen to Sordino,"
1445,XXI,"Whose English he but scarcely understood,"
1446,XXI,"And half afraid of this so swarthy stranger,"
1447,XXI,"In times, like those, so full of lurking danger,"
1448,XXI,"But when he saw his gold, it seemed quite good,"
1449,XXI,And gave consent to let his helper go.
1450,XXI,
1451,XXI,"But not before his mother had been seen,"
1452,XXI,"Her sanction gained, for what he felt some fears,"
1453,XXI,"And so they left the sheaves of ripened wheat,"
1454,XXI,"And sought their humble dwelling’s blithe retreat,--"
1455,XXI,"A little cottage, thatched, and gray with years,"
1456,XXI,Amid the trees and garden-beds still green.
1457,XXI,
1458,XXI,"And here they tarried till the close of day,"
1459,XXI,"Till Vesper-bells proclaimed its toil should cease,"
1460,XXI,"Yea, tarried over night, for mother’s heart"
1461,XXI,"Is more reluctant with the child to part,"
1462,XXI,"But in the morn she said: “Do as ye please,”"
1463,XXI,"And gave her blessing, and they went away."
1464,XXI,
1465,XXI,"And as they left, the peals from Shoreditch tow’r"
1466,XXI,Came on the crispéd morning air like streams
1467,XXI,"Of living water from the Holy Mount,--"
1468,XXI,Where priests with silver basins at its fount
1469,XXI,"Oblation brought to golden Cherubims,"
1470,XXI,Amid rejoicing of the festive hour.
1471,XXI,
1472,XXI,"Their cleansing tones, refreshing to the mind,"
1473,XXI,"And nature, smiling, drank their harmony,"
1474,XXI,"The crystal dew vibrating with delight,"
1475,XXI,"A veil of mist, the garment of the night,"
1476,XXI,"Hung o’er the deepest valley, seemed to flee"
1477,XXI,Before their dancing with a timid wind.
1478,XXI,
1479,XXI,Sordino felt their rapture like a flow
1480,XXI,"Of scented warmth, which crept through limbs and brain,"
1481,XXI,"And to his heart, where lotus-like it stayed,"
1482,XXI,"Until each chilling sorrow was allayed,"
1483,XXI,"And joy of other years returned again,"
1484,XXI,Enkindling in his face a new life’s glow.
1485,XXI,
1486,XXI,"The silent, wond’ring lad, who followed him,"
1487,XXI,"Had often heard this gladsome melody,"
1488,XXI,"It was a part of him from infancy,"
1489,XXI,"It cast upon his soul a witchery,"
1490,XXI,"From which no mood or attitude was free,"
1491,XXI,And claimed him for a realm remote and dim.
1492,XXI,
1493,XXI,It was the springtime of the golden age
1494,XXI,"Of England’s minstrelsy, and here and there"
1495,XXI,"A youth did feel its heart-throb ’mid the flowers,"
1496,XXI,"And saw sweet, flitting forms amongst the bowers,"
1497,XXI,"And heard transporting voices in the air,"
1498,XXI,Which captured him and did his life engage.
1499,XXI,
1500,XXI,"And though, perhaps, he never won a name,"
1501,XXI,"And though it spoiled his life for “useful things,”"
1502,XXI,"And Fate endowed him, as she did a Greene,"
1503,XXI,"With wretched penury and squalor mean,--"
1504,XXI,Still he who sees and hears and gladly sings
1505,XXI,"Hath recompense, transcending gold and fame."
1506,XXI,
1507,XXI,"Woe, unto him around whose cradle danced"
1508,XXI,"The fairies on the golden morning ray,"
1509,XXI,"Anointing him with essence of the rose,"
1510,XXI,"Into whose soul the magic music flows,"
1511,XXI,"To shape itself into a deathless lay,"
1512,XXI,"Who all denies, by earthliness entranced."
1513,XXI,
1514,XXI,"To him no smiling faces shall appear,"
1515,XXI,"When comes the eve of life with lowering sky,"
1516,XXI,"But voices chiding him with cowardice,"
1517,XXI,"Because he chose the lucre and the ease,"
1518,XXI,"And did his calling wilfully deny,--"
1519,XXI,"To him no light shall be,--but darkness drear."

1524,XXII,’Twas here that from the church and nature rose
1525,XXII,"The English stage, when he, the stable-groom,"
1526,XXII,"Should write the Drama of Humanity,--"
1527,XXII,"The greatest poet of all history,"
1528,XXII,"Who mingled laughter with the deepest gloom,"
1529,XXII,Life’s music with its sterner prose.
1530,XXII,
1531,XXII,"The modern drama,--modern Ishmael,"
1532,XXII,"Begotten of religion; like a youth,"
1533,XXII,"Fair, myrtle-crowned, and slender, innocent,"
1534,XXII,With dancing measures upon pleasure bent;
1535,XXII,"Then cast away by “guardians of the truth,”"
1536,XXII,"And, homeless, nourished at the secret well."
1537,XXII,
1538,XXII,"And when his great Emancipator came,"
1539,XXII,"He dared to dance and frisk on country lanes,"
1540,XXII,But not in London town (his mother’s there);
1541,XXII,Until the king of poesy laid bare
1542,XXII,"His ancient birthright, lost ’mongst Grecian manes,"
1543,XXII,"Then waxed he strong and daily gained in fame,"
1544,XXII,
1545,XXII,"And found a home within the city wall,"
1546,XXII,"Where still he dwells, and ever will abide,"
1547,XXII,"In his duplicity, since life is very double,"
1548,XXII,"A-laughing, crying, at its fleeting bubble,"
1549,XXII,"Appearing on the restless ocean-tide,"
1550,XXII,"In morning splendor, or dusk even-fall."
1551,XXII,
1552,XXII,"Still Ishmael, to Sarah’s first begotten,"
1553,XXII,"Still preached against by heaven’s best elect,"
1554,XXII,"And he returns, at times, with taunts and gibes;"
1555,XXII,"But if they put away some modern scribes,"
1556,XXII,"And did great Shakespeare’s drama resurrect,"
1557,XXII,Our modern stage would not be half as rotten.
1558,XXII,
1559,XXII,"Regenerated, cleansed, what ally this"
1560,XXII,To all that’s true and noble under heaven!
1561,XXII,A mirror of ourselves? Much more! A vision
1562,XXII,"Of life’s ideal, and its highest mission,"
1563,XXII,"And though the weary heart must mirth be given,"
1564,XXII,The thrill of truth’s clear gleam is better bliss.
1565,XXII,
1566,XXII,"So, let the true born help the quondam alien,"
1567,XXII,They need each other in their common quest
1568,XXII,"For happiness, the rainbow’s pot of gold,"
1569,XXII,And let the secret of the quest be told
1570,XXII,"By each, in love, that each may do his best"
1571,XXII,"To lift and cheer, where life is low and failing."
1572,XXII,
1573,XXII,
1574,XXIII,XXIII
1575,XXIII,
1576,XXIII,"Into the city on the Thames they walked,"
1577,XXIII,"And to the inn, where he had rented rooms,"
1578,XXIII,"An hospitable inn, by no means small,"
1579,XXIII,"Of quaint designs, o’ershadowed by some tall,"
1580,XXIII,"Outspreading elm trees, in whose pleasant glooms"
1581,XXIII,The thievish rooks to one another talked.
1582,XXIII,
1583,XXIII,"And there were gardens in its rear, where fruit"
1584,XXIII,"Of cherries and of pears were sweetly ripe,"
1585,XXIII,"For London still had nature in its heart,"
1586,XXIII,Long since ejected by a soul-less mart;
1587,XXIII,"Though knowing statesmen may its grandeur pipe,"
1588,XXIII,Another Shakespeare it makes ever mute.
1589,XXIII,
1590,XXIII,Here did Sordino hope to respite find
1591,XXIII,From journeys which accounted seemed but vain;
1592,XXIII,He would his simple country-lad engage
1593,XXIII,"In spying bells, and in the work of page,"
1594,XXIII,For such a boy he easily could train:
1595,XXIII,He had an honest heart and ready mind.
1596,XXIII,
1597,XXIII,"This tavern was, however, seldom quiet,"
1598,XXIII,"But oft for merry souls a rendezvous,--"
1599,XXIII,"For wits and poets, chiefly for the latter,"
1600,XXIII,To whom the outside of the social platter
1601,XXIII,"Was less important than the inside true,"
1602,XXIII,Whose highest law was their own spirit’s fiat.
1603,XXIII,
1604,XXIII,"When God makes poets He’s misunderstood,"
1605,XXIII,The mixture is too much for common folk;
1606,XXIII,"The blending of all things in earth and heaven,"
1607,XXIII,"Of light and darkness, unto them is given,"
1608,XXIII,"An angel and a fiend in common yoke,"
1609,XXIII,The great extremes of evil and of good.
1610,XXIII,
1611,XXIII,"As in time’s morn the light from darkness sprang,"
1612,XXIII,"And cosmic beauty out of Chaos rose,"
1613,XXIII,Thus out of reeking stews and taverns came
1614,XXIII,"A Marlow’s strong, illuminating flame,"
1615,XXIII,"And stars of magnitudes did follow close,--"
1616,XXIII,The morning stars which rapt together sang.

1620,XXIV,
1621,XXIV,"The sights of London were but meagre then,"
1622,XXIV,Compared with all its wonders of to-day;--
1623,XXIV,"Still each age thinks his own the grandest, best,"
1624,XXIV,"A truth, may be, why else the ceaseless quest?"
1625,XXIV,"Though it is left to Wisdom yet to say,"
1626,XXIV,If things are worse or better among men.
1627,XXIV,
1628,XXIV,"The Tow’r knew greater anguish in those days,"
1629,XXIV,The bridge gave terror with its ghastliness
1630,XXIV,Of hoary heads uplifted high on spits;
1631,XXIV,"The palaces had dungeons, vermin-pits"
1632,XXIV,Of heartless cruelties and grim distress;
1633,XXIV,"And halls of splendor had dark, hidden ways."
1634,XXIV,
1635,XXIV,"But there was sunlight on the crimson tile,"
1636,XXIV,"And there was blueness in the open sky,"
1637,XXIV,"And breezes bore the scent of rose and thyme,"
1638,XXIV,"As in the morn they met St. Mary’s chime,"
1639,XXIV,"No cloud of smoke, as now, oppressed the eye,"
1640,XXIV,And made the gentle breath of heaven vile.
1641,XXIV,
1642,XXIV,"And men were frank and honest with their friends,"
1643,XXIV,"And also frank and honest with their foes,"
1644,XXIV,"And either loved with nakedness of soul,"
1645,XXIV,"Or fought until one of the two did fall,"
1646,XXIV,"Strong was the love, and hard the hater’s blows,"
1647,XXIV,While now his love and hate man subtly blends.
1648,XXIV,
1649,XXIV,"Sordino loitered much in lane and street,"
1650,XXIV,"And listened well to every swinging bell,"
1651,XXIV,"And searched the city for his treasure lost,"
1652,XXIV,"But not a sound was from a steeple tost,"
1653,XXIV,"Of its abiding-place his ear to tell,"
1654,XXIV,Nor did a single clue his vision meet.
1655,XXIV,
1656,XXIV,"He daily searched, until the winter fog"
1657,XXIV,"Began to close about the sightly town,"
1658,XXIV,"Then melancholy claimed him for her own,"
1659,XXIV,"And lest he should be lost in grief and groan,"
1660,XXIV,He sought the company of those who drown
1661,XXIV,The sorrows of their hearts with ale and grog.

1664,XXV,XXV
1665,XXV,
1666,XXV,"Once poets tuned their lyres in praise of Bacchus,--"
1667,XXV,Forsooth he was a mirth-inspiring god--
1668,XXV,"All garlanded with leaves of blooming vine,--"
1669,XXV,"Adored by Aphrodite and the Nine,--"
1670,XXV,Bacchant and Satyr at his worship trod
1671,XXV,"Fantastic measures, such as now would wrack us."
1672,XXV,
1673,XXV,"Bards have turned preachers, which is for the better,"
1674,XXV,"And no more should their songs extol his name,"
1675,XXV,But rather sound the anguish and the woe
1676,XXV,"Brought upon man by this relentless foe,"
1677,XXV,"Take up the note of poverty and shame,"
1678,XXV,And ills of drunkenness which man enfetter.
1679,XXV,

1688,XXV,"The victims of the cup, the self-condemned,"
1689,XXV,Who fight a hopeless battle and go down;
1690,XXV,"Show love and pity, rather than a frown,"
1691,XXV,"For though the sot by men may be contemned,--"
1692,XXV,Still there is One who came to save the lost.
1693,XXV,
1694,XXV,We know but little why he gave himself
1695,XXV,"An abject slave to appetite and lust,"
1696,XXV,What passions of past generations found
1697,XXV,"In him their culmination, held him bound,"
1698,XXV,"And though he struggled hard, it seems he must"
1699,XXV,Into the depths of sin and darkness delv.
1700,XXV,
1701,XXV,"Perchance ambition was his Waterloo,"
1702,XXV,"And having lost the last and strongest trench,"
1703,XXV,"He spends a starless night mid weeping gloom,"
1704,XXV,"Abandoning life’s dreams to their dark tomb,"
1705,XXV,"He seeks, at last, his soul’s remorse to quench"
1706,XXV,With what he knows his manhood will undo.
1707,XXV,
1708,XXV,"Perhaps the fire of love has been extinguished,"
1709,XXV,"And left but cooling ashes on the hearth,"
1710,XXV,"And one, whose face was radiant with light,"
1711,XXV,"Moves ’round him like a shadow of the night,"
1712,XXV,"And since his life has lost its highest worth,"
1713,XXV,"He turns to Rum, and soon is all relinquished."
1714,XXV,
1715,XXV,
1716,XXVI,XXVI
1717,XXVI,
1718,XXVI,"When men are drunk, they often babble things,"
1719,XXVI,"They scarce would whisper to a bosom-friend,"
1720,XXVI,"But when the wine has loosened sense and tongue,"
1721,XXVI,"The hidden secret to the crowd is flung,"
1722,XXVI,And with an oath its owner will defend
1723,XXVI,"A truth exaggerated, till the ring"
1724,XXVI,
1725,XXVI,"Of brawlers doth declare it is a lie,"
1726,XXVI,For which he ought to buy a round of drinks;
1727,XXVI,"Thus in that tavern, on a foggy night,"
1728,XXVI,"A group was sitting in the candle-light,"
1729,XXVI,"Around a table, drinking, till their blinks"
1730,XXVI,Did tell that Reason was about to fly.
1731,XXVI,
1732,XXVI,"And one, a bearded, lion-voiced sailor,"
1733,XXVI,"Began to tell of escapades at sea,--"
1734,XXVI,"Of war in foreign lands, of victory,"
1735,XXVI,"In such a loud and boasting way, that three"
1736,XXVI,"Out of the five did laugh derisively,"
1737,XXVI,"And said, he was a bandy-legged tailor."
1738,XXVI,
1739,XXVI,"At which he swore and drained his tankard dry,"
1740,XXVI,"And called them all a motley lubber-gang,"
1741,XXVI,"And rose to go, but then his friends cried “no,”"
1742,XXVI,"“You must not leave us yet, for dontcher know,"
1743,XXVI,The best is coming? Say how did ye hang
1744,XXVI,Those tinklers in the tow’r?--Let’s have a rye!”
1745,XXVI,
1746,XXVI,"Sordino being witness to this scene,"
1747,XXVI,"Approached the table and said: “Gentlemen,"
1748,XXVI,"Allow me to provide a drink for all,”"
1749,XXVI,A sentence which upon their ears did fall
1750,XXVI,"With some surprise, since he a stranger; then"
1751,XXVI,A grin of acceptation in their mien.
1752,XXVI,
1753,XXVI,"And he sat down with them, and freely drank,"
1754,XXVI,"And paid for all the drinks, the barmaid poured,"
1755,XXVI,"Thus made them almost feel, he was their host,"
1756,XXVI,"And when he ordered for their midnight lunch a roast,"
1757,XXVI,They sang his praise; the grizzly sailor roared:
1758,XXVI,"“Say, fellow, have you robbed the Venice bank?”"
1759,XXVI,
1760,XXVI,"They revelled, and caroused, and stories told,"
1761,XXVI,"The most of which were tavern-coarse and smutty,--"
1762,XXVI,The sailor being richest in his stores
1763,XXVI,"Of drunken bouts and fights on foreign shores,"
1764,XXVI,"But as the chemist in the chimney-sut finds tutty,"
1765,XXVI,Thus sought Sordino in this slag the gold.
1766,XXVI,
1767,XXVI,For he had thought at first to see a glint
1768,XXVI,"Of something in the “tinklers and the tower,”"
1769,XXVI,And now he tried to draw the sailor out
1770,XXVI,On this allusion in his fellow’s flout;--
1771,XXVI,"An instant’s hesitation and a lower,"
1772,XXVI,And then the old tar understood the hint.
1773,XXVI,
1774,XXVI,"“The tinklers, aye, ha! ha! those merry bells,"
1775,XXVI,"We carried up from France to Limerick,--"
1776,XXVI,"And nearly lost in a confounded gale,--"
1777,XXVI,"Aye, aye, old top, by these there hangs a tale,--"
1778,XXVI,"I heard from one who wounded lay and sick,--"
1779,XXVI,A soldier who had seen a hundred hells.”
1780,XXVI,
1781,XXVI,“Those bells were taken in a bloody war
1782,XXVI,"Sir,--what is that to thee?--another drink!”"
1783,XXVI,"Sordino forced a laugh, and ordered wine,--"
1784,XXVI,"A bottle of old port--none did decline,"
1785,XXVI,"But drank, until the weak began to wink,"
1786,XXVI,And Silence made encroachment round the bar.
1787,XXVI,
1788,XXVI,"The sailor bibbed the longest, ate his roast,"
1789,XXVI,"And told Sordino, how the bells were sold"
1790,XXVI,"To a great churchman in the Irish isle,"
1791,XXVI,That they are ringing daily from a pile
1792,XXVI,"Most venerable, whence no price of gold"
1793,XXVI,Can e’er return them to their native coast.
1794,XXVI,
1795,XXVI,"Sordino knew, they were his own, and smiled"
1796,XXVI,"To learn the place where strangely they had landed,"
1797,XXVI,"And when the sailor swore it all was true,"
1798,XXVI,"Sordino from the company withdrew,"
1799,XXVI,"But not before it was of him demanded,"
1800,XXVI,That what he heard for ever must be “tiled.”
1801,XXVI,
1802,XXVI,
1803,XXVII,XXVII
1804,XXVII,
1805,XXVII,"Sordino looking for his boy that night,"
1806,XXVII,"Found him departed, whither, none could tell;"
1807,XXVII,"They sought him in the tavern and the street,"
1808,XXVII,But all in vain; the watchman on his beat
1809,XXVII,"Was queried, as he passed and cried: “All’s well!”"
1810,XXVII,And laughingly replied: “He’s out of sight!”
1811,XXVII,
1812,XXVII,"The boy had weary grown and sick for home,"
1813,XXVII,"When he his master saw with drunkards douce,"
1814,XXVII,"And dared the denseness of the fog, to find"
1815,XXVII,"That place which daily occupied his mind,--"
1816,XXVII,"The little cottage ’mongst the trees, recluse,"
1817,XXVII,Seemed grander than the city’s pillard dome.
1818,XXVII,
1819,XXVII,"A dog might find its way, but not a child,"
1820,XXVII,"Through such a maze, bewildering and weird;"
1821,XXVII,"He thought, he surely knew the homeward road,"
1822,XXVII,"And eagerly, for hours, he onward strode,"
1823,XXVII,"But only to discover, what he feared:"
1824,XXVII,He was as lost as ’mid a forest wild.
1825,XXVII,
1826,XXVII,The Thames was like a spectral realm of sound
1827,XXVII,And shapes: The masts of many ships at tow
1828,XXVII,"Were dimly visible, and larger seemed,--"
1829,XXVII,"Like mighty giants, as the moonlight beamed"
1830,XXVII,Into the woolly fog. The sounds below:--
1831,XXVII,"The river’s song, and baying of a hound."
1832,XXVII,
1833,XXVII,All else was silent till a sailor coughed
1834,XXVII,And damned the dog which thus disturbed his sleep;
1835,XXVII,And now the wand’ring lad called out in fear:
1836,XXVII,"“I’m lost, oh, help me, who-soe’er is near!”"
1837,XXVII,"To which a voice arose, as from the deep:"
1838,XXVII,“It is a lubber straying from his croft.”
1839,XXVII,
1840,XXVII,"But then, ere long, there was a splash of oar,"
1841,XXVII,"And muffled talking twixt two drowsy tars,"
1842,XXVII,"The boy took heart, since rescue was at hand;"
1843,XXVII,"But when he found himself pushed out from land,"
1844,XXVII,"And lifted to a deck of lofty spars,"
1845,XXVII,He kind of wished himself back to the shore.
1846,XXVII,
1847,XXVII,The sailors showed him to a bunk for rest.
1848,XXVII,"“Yea, in the morn the fog may lifted be,"
1849,XXVII,"So you can find your way,” thus cheered they him;"
1850,XXVII,But as of old the halfbaked Ephraim
1851,XXVII,"Howled on his bed, so would now even he,"
1852,XXVII,Had not submission been for him the best.
1853,XXVII,
1854,XXVII,
1855,XXVIII,XXVIII
1856,XXVIII,
1857,XXVIII,"The fog grew lighter with the dawn of day,"
1858,XXVIII,"As did the boy’s heart after night of weeping,"
1859,XXVIII,"He early ’rose, and would have left the ship,"
1860,XXVIII,"But since for boatswain he possessed no tip,"
1861,XXVIII,"He dared not rouse him from his pleasant sleeping,"
1862,XXVIII,And distance from the shore compelled his stay.
1863,XXVIII,
1864,XXVIII,"At last both crew and passengers awoke,"
1865,XXVIII,"And all gazed at the lad, some with a smile,"
1866,XXVIII,"When of his rescue told, some poked their fun;"
1867,XXVIII,"But ’mongst the passengers his eye met one,"
1868,XXVIII,"Who read the trouble of a homesick child,"
1869,XXVIII,And in strange accents kindly to him spoke.
1870,XXVIII,
1871,XXVIII,"She seemed to him the fairest he had seen,"
1872,XXVIII,"A spirit, from the silv’ry mist emerged,"
1873,XXVIII,"A gleam of light, strayed from the hidden sun,"
1874,XXVIII,"Enlivening the sodden scene and dun,"
1875,XXVIII,"A Venus from the foam where billows surged,"
1876,XXVIII,"Born to be worshiped, or to be a queen."
1877,XXVIII,
1878,XXVIII,"But what she said to him was quite Egyptian,"
1879,XXVIII,"It mattered not, since he could understand"
1880,XXVIII,"The sympathy and goodness of her heart,"
1881,XXVIII,A thing much better than linguistic art
1882,XXVIII,"In any woman, yea, in any man,--"
1883,XXVIII,"Though speech is fine, the deed is much more Christian."
1884,XXVIII,
1885,XXVIII,"She gave him food and wine and cheered his soul,"
1886,XXVIII,"Then left him to himself, an hour or so,"
1887,XXVIII,When came the captain and thus to him spake:
1888,XXVIII,"“Art thou a stranger here, or canst thou make"
1889,XXVIII,"Thy way alone and knowest where to go,"
1890,XXVIII,When lifted is the fog’s distressing pall?”
1891,XXVIII,
1892,XXVIII,"To which the lad replied: “I know the town,"
1893,XXVIII,"When I can see its street and thoroughfare,"
1894,XXVIII,"And now can find my way up to the inn,"
1895,XXVIII,"Where dwells my master; oh, it was a sin,"
1896,XXVIII,"That I deserted him, since he may care!"
1897,XXVIII,I will return to him;--please let me down!”
1898,XXVIII,
1899,XXVIII,To which the captain said: “We have on board
1900,XXVIII,"Two passengers who wish an inn to find,"
1901,XXVIII,"And canst thou guide them to such place, my son?"
1902,XXVIII,"That lovely lady, whom you met, is one,"
1903,XXVIII,"The other is her father, noble, kind,"
1904,XXVIII,"A foreign scholar, and methinks, a lord.”"
1905,XXVIII,
1906,XXVIII,"The boy responded readily to this,"
1907,XXVIII,"As mid-day drew on clear, became their guide,"
1908,XXVIII,"Up to that quite pretentious hostelry,"
1909,XXVIII,"Half glad, half ’fraid his master there to see,"
1910,XXVIII,"But ignorant how fate strode by his side,"
1911,XXVIII,And how it seldom seems to go amiss.
1912,XXVIII,
1913,XXVIII,
1914,XXIX,XXIX
1915,XXIX,
1916,XXIX,That afternoon Sordino sought his place
1917,XXIX,"Among the garden-trees, a rustic seat,"
1918,XXIX,"Which during gloomy days had stood alone,"
1919,XXIX,"But now again the sun so brightly shone,"
1920,XXIX,"Inviting him to this belov’d retreat,"
1921,XXIX,Though it had lost the summer’s tender grace.
1922,XXIX,
1923,XXIX,"And whom should here his pensive eyes behold,"
1924,XXIX,"But one of whom he at that moment thought,"
1925,XXIX,"And as he met her quite astonished gaze,"
1926,XXIX,"Surprise brought strong emotions to his face,"
1927,XXIX,"He knew not what strange magic this had wrought,"
1928,XXIX,"His heart beat fast, his hands grew clammy cold."
1929,XXIX,
1930,XXIX,"She smiled, and greeted him in his own tongue,"
1931,XXIX,"Then wist he that it was no mere illusion,"
1932,XXIX,"But Stella, yea, the Stella of his dreams,"
1933,XXIX,"So strange, so sweetly strange, it ever seems"
1934,XXIX,"To lonely lovers such a rapt confusion,"
1935,XXIX,When that which separates aside is flung.
1936,XXIX,
1937,XXIX,And yet it did not give to him the joy
1938,XXIX,Of one who knows why his beloved came;
1939,XXIX,"He wondered much, but did not dare to ask,"
1940,XXIX,"His self-control became a subtle mask,"
1941,XXIX,"Which hid the raging of the inward flame,"
1942,XXIX,That might again a newborn hope destroy.
1943,XXIX,
1944,XXIX,"A woman’s eye can look through lover’s feint,"
1945,XXIX,"Behind his mask she sees the naked soul,"
1946,XXIX,"And laughs with mingled sympathy and scorn,"
1947,XXIX,"She suffers not because he is forlorn,"
1948,XXIX,And rather likes to see him prostrate fall
1949,XXIX,"Before her feet, as if she were a saint."
1950,XXIX,
1951,XXIX,"And Stella knew, it racked Sordino’s mind"
1952,XXIX,"Why she was there, but only this she told:"
1953,XXIX,“My father and myself last night arrived
1954,XXIX,"In London harbor, but the fog contrived"
1955,XXIX,"To keep us captives in the vessel’s hold,"
1956,XXIX,"Until this morn, when we this place did find.”"
1957,XXIX,
1958,XXIX,“How found ye it?” Sordino dared to question.
1959,XXIX,"“A lad who said his master’s lodging here,"
1960,XXIX,"Did guide us, and, methinks I see him there.”"
1961,XXIX,"Sordino turned and saw the boy’s despair,"
1962,XXIX,"And called him in a tone that felled his fear,"
1963,XXIX,"He came, and was forgiv’n without confession."
1964,XXIX,
1965,XXIX,"And Stella took his hand and stroked his head,"
1966,XXIX,"Sordino wishing that he was the lad,"
1967,XXIX,"He found a coin and told him to be gone,"
1968,XXIX,"And like the earth from which the fog was blown,"
1969,XXIX,"The boy felt in his heart relieved and glad,"
1970,XXIX,And brushed his master’s clothes and made his bed.
1971,XXIX,
1972,XXIX,"Alone, the conversation of the two"
1973,XXIX,"Was chiefly about trifles and the weather,"
1974,XXIX,"With many pauses, since so much did press"
1975,XXIX,"Sordino’s heart, so much he would confess,"
1976,XXIX,And since it was so strange to be together
1977,XXIX,"With her whom he adored, yet did not know."
1978,XXIX,
1979,XXIX,"Soon Stella, pleading cold, arose to go,"
1980,XXIX,"Without a promise of another meeting,"
1981,XXIX,"Sordino feeling chills about his heart,"
1982,XXIX,"And as they from the garden did depart,"
1983,XXIX,"That little hour so full, and yet so fleeting,"
1984,XXIX,"Seemed to him fatal, and mal á propos."
1985,XXIX,
1986,XXIX,
1987,XXX,XXX
1988,XXX,
1989,XXX,"Love’s like a great musician, whose deft fingers"
1990,XXX,Control the hidden pow’r of organ-keys;
1991,XXX,"He plays upon the soul with mastery,"
1992,XXX,"And uses all the stops of melody,"
1993,XXX,"Of deepest sorrow, highest ecstacies,"
1994,XXX,"Of stormy fugues, or tune that softly lingers."
1995,XXX,
1996,XXX,"Thus did he play upon Sordino’s heart,"
1997,XXX,When to himself he suddenly was left;
1998,XXX,"A flood of passion overwhelmed his soul,"
1999,XXX,"In which he heard himself her name to call,"
2000,XXX,"And spent, did leave him painfully bereft,"
2001,XXX,"Yea, caused unmanly, bitter tears to start."
2002,XXX,
2003,XXX,"He wiped away the furtive tear, and went"
2004,XXX,"Into the bar-room, where he called for wine,"
2005,XXX,"And freely drank, then entering the street,"
2006,XXX,"The sailor of last night he chanced to meet,"
2007,XXX,"Who told him, for a drink he sore did pine,"
2008,XXX,"And had, alas! his very farthings spent."
2009,XXX,
2010,XXX,Sordino handed him sufficient coin
2011,XXX,To make him happy for another night;
2012,XXX,"He thanked him most profusely, and betook"
2013,XXX,"Himself into the tavern’s pleasant nook,"
2014,XXX,"Where he did find his life’s supreme delight,--"
2015,XXX,A cup of sack and others it to join.
2016,XXX,
2017,XXX,"Sordino sauntered carelessly along,"
2018,XXX,"And with no aim but to assuage his mind,"
2019,XXX,"Which wandered twixt a ray of hope and fear,"
2020,XXX,"When all at once he saw her drawing near,"
2021,XXX,In company with one whose eye did find
2022,XXX,Her smile surcharged with an affection strong.
2023,XXX,
2024,XXX,A moment’s glance told of his manly cast;
2025,XXX,"Well-knit and tall, in military suit,"
2026,XXX,But with a face so much unlike her mien;
2027,XXX,"And what Sordino could instantly glean,"
2028,XXX,"It had a strength, but not of thought and truth,"
2029,XXX,"But rather courage, stemming any blast."
2030,XXX,
2031,XXX,"Correctly he surmised, this very man"
2032,XXX,"Was Stella’s fiancé; and Jealousy,"
2033,XXX,"That “greeneyed monster,” held him by the throat,"
2034,XXX,"Or, as in modern parlance “had his goat,”"
2035,XXX,A phrase suggestive of the purity
2036,XXX,"Of English, even among a college clan."
2037,XXX,
2038,XXX,"The jealousy of outraged marriage bonds,"
2039,XXX,"Real, or imagined as Othello’s,"
2040,XXX,"Oft finds expression in a dark revenge,"
2041,XXX,"The faithless spouse is treated as a wench,"
2042,XXX,"The vile seducer suffers every loss,"
2043,XXX,"Unless, perchance, he with his prize absconds."
2044,XXX,
2045,XXX,"With hapless suitors has she gentler ways,"
2046,XXX,"When pledgeless smiles is all they have obtained,"
2047,XXX,"Though none may fully know what she may do,"
2048,XXX,"(For even of such full many ones she slew),"
2049,XXX,"But in this case, Sordino, deeply pained,"
2050,XXX,She led about as in a dreamy haze.
2051,XXX,
2052,XXX,"He wandered on the banks of wimpling Thames,"
2053,XXX,"And on the anchored ships did idly stare,"
2054,XXX,But had no mind for all the life and mirth
2055,XXX,"Beneath the languid sails upon the firth,"
2056,XXX,"Since nought he saw but that one happy pair,"
2057,XXX,"And but two eyes, more glorious than gems."
2058,XXX,
2059,XXX,With night’s approach his feelings took the hue
2060,XXX,"Of creeping shadows and the purple dark,"
2061,XXX,"And sadness grew to an oppressive load,--"
2062,XXX,"Then Jealousy to anger did him goad,"
2063,XXX,"And to its fouler plots he once did hark,"
2064,XXX,Which with a frenzy did his blood imbue.
2065,XXX,
2066,XXX,"Then came the music of St. Mary’s bell,"
2067,XXX,"Commingling with St. Paul’s of deeper tongue,"
2068,XXX,"And oped his prison of unhappiness,"
2069,XXX,"They had a solace that could calm and bless,"
2070,XXX,"And when the last vibrating note was rung,"
2071,XXX,"He homeward turned, and whispered: “All is well.”"
2072,XXX,
2073,XXX,
2074,XXXI,XXXI
2075,XXXI,
2076,XXXI,As a philosopher Sordino tried
2077,XXXI,"To make himself believe that all was well,"
2078,XXXI,"Howe’er something opposed his wise decree,--"
2079,XXXI,"He sought to sup, but found each dish to be"
2080,XXXI,"Devoid of savor both in taste and smell,"
2081,XXXI,His spleen the head’s philosophy defied.
2082,XXXI,
2083,XXXI,"He sought his couch and courted gentle sleep,"
2084,XXXI,"And stoically scorned his love-affair,"
2085,XXXI,"But Somnus was so far away, unheeding,"
2086,XXXI,And thoughts in solitude were slowly feeding
2087,XXXI,"Upon his heart, like lions in their lair,"
2088,XXXI,"Instead of rest, his misery grew deep."
2089,XXXI,
2090,XXXI,"The clock struck ten, he rose and left his room;"
2091,XXXI,"The bar was lively, and he chose its folly;"
2092,XXXI,"There was the sailor, garrulous and drunk,"
2093,XXXI,"In company with one, a quondam monk,"
2094,XXXI,"From Henry’s reign, when monks, unduly jolly,"
2095,XXXI,Were driven from pretended cloister-gloom.
2096,XXXI,
2097,XXXI,But if the ruby brightness of his nose
2098,XXXI,"Was then acquired, or in his homeless state,"
2099,XXXI,"Is not for me to say, but it surpassed"
2100,XXXI,"Even his who years had sailed before the mast,"
2101,XXXI,And with the aid of gin and stormy fate
2102,XXXI,Had made it blossom like an Irish rose.
2103,XXXI,
2104,XXXI,These two from spheres so far apart had met
2105,XXXI,"Across a stoop of ale, which like the river"
2106,XXXI,"Of classic eld can quench all mundane sorrow,"
2107,XXXI,"Make men forgetful of the past and morrow,"
2108,XXXI,"Upon whose bosom dreams all sunlit quiver,"
2109,XXXI,Until it empties in a sea of jet.
2110,XXXI,
2111,XXXI,Upon the sailor’s quick discovery
2112,XXXI,"Of Count Sordino’s presence, he approached"
2113,XXXI,Him with a courtsy very risible
2114,XXXI,"And whispered that he had something to tell,"
2115,XXXI,"Which on their precious secret did encroach,"
2116,XXXI,"And asked him, come aside from company."
2117,XXXI,
2118,XXXI,"Sordino followed with a sense of fear,"
2119,XXXI,"That it was money which the rogue was after,"
2120,XXXI,And cared but little for his muddled talk;
2121,XXXI,"Soon on the dark, deserted garden-walk"
2122,XXXI,"They stood, where faint the hum and laughter"
2123,XXXI,"Of drinking men, fell on the listening ear."
2124,XXXI,
2125,XXXI,"In broken sentences, and low, the croon"
2126,XXXI,Confided to Sordino something strange:
2127,XXXI,"He had that very eve beheld the man,"
2128,XXXI,"Who brought the bells from France to old Ireland,"
2129,XXXI,"First on the street, then on a garden-bench,"
2130,XXXI,"Embracing a young lady, ’neath the moon."
2131,XXXI,
2132,XXXI,"Moreover, he had chanced to meet a fellow,"
2133,XXXI,"Who used to wear the cowl, in whilom days,"
2134,XXXI,"But had doffed cloth and everything religious,"
2135,XXXI,"And though his story was somewhat ambiguous,"
2136,XXXI,"He claims to know the chimes, and doth much praise"
2137,XXXI,Their wondrous tones as very clear and mellow.
2138,XXXI,
2139,XXXI,This tale engrossed Sordino’s mind intensely;
2140,XXXI,"They entered, sought the monk, who half asleep"
2141,XXXI,Sat by a table all alone; the two
2142,XXXI,"Aroused him with a drink of better brew,"
2143,XXXI,Now with the sailor he the best did reap
2144,XXXI,From the Count’s interest and liberality.
2145,XXXI,
2146,XXXI,Sordino made agreement with these men
2147,XXXI,"To go with him to Ireland, even that week,"
2148,XXXI,"Which they did promise for a goodly hire,--"
2149,XXXI,"For both declared, they knew the very spire,"
2150,XXXI,Around whose golden cross his chimes did seek
2151,XXXI,Their flight up to the list’ning choirs of heaven.
2152,XXXI,
2153,XXXI,
2154,XXXII,XXXII
2155,XXXII,
2156,XXXII,"O, god of gold, whose universal sway"
2157,XXXII,"Is not the underworld, on the Plutonic shore,"
2158,XXXII,"And hideous, like that of Spencer’s dream,"
2159,XXXII,"But on our terra’s face, bright with the gleam"
2160,XXXII,"Of mid-day sun, thy power has ever more"
2161,XXXII,Commanded human nature to obey!
2162,XXXII,
2163,XXXII,"Thou sittest not in gloomy woods and caves,"
2164,XXXII,"A loathsome creature with the hoarded pelf,"
2165,XXXII,"But in the palace and the mansion bright,"
2166,XXXII,"In marble temples large and fair, bedight,"
2167,XXXII,"A princely being, though controlled by Self,"
2168,XXXII,To whom most men submit themselves as slaves.
2169,XXXII,
2170,XXXII,"The beautiful, the learnéd, and the strong"
2171,XXXII,Are vying with the baser mass to serve
2172,XXXII,"Thee ardently, that favor they may find,"
2173,XXXII,"They offer beauty, skill of hand and mind,"
2174,XXXII,"And ceaseless toil, until the vital nerve"
2175,XXXII,"Of life is gone, the source of joy and song."
2176,XXXII,
2177,XXXII,"Some barter soul and body for the gold,"
2178,XXXII,And bear but semblance to the freeborn man;
2179,XXXII,"The food is rich, the wine is sparkling red,"
2180,XXXII,"What matter then, if soul and heart are dead;--"
2181,XXXII,"But in the darkness stand the masses wan,"
2182,XXXII,And homeless children shiver in the cold.
2183,XXXII,
2184,XXXII,"Thou rulest kings and statesmen in their places,"
2185,XXXII,"Thou makest war, and causest it to cease,"
2186,XXXII,"Thou art the world’s supremest autocrat,"
2187,XXXII,And e’en our land is bending on the mat
2188,XXXII,"Before thy power’s terrible increase,"
2189,XXXII,Which even the shallow lawgiver amazes.
2190,XXXII,
2191,XXXII,"It is not lavish gifts alone that bind,"
2192,XXXII,"But ev’n the droppings of the shining ore,"
2193,XXXII,"Thus here, the tips, Sordino gave the salt,"
2194,XXXII,"Enthralled him to a virtue or a fault,--"
2195,XXXII,"So in a whisper, recklessly he swore:"
2196,XXXII,“I’ll take that coward and knock out his wind!”
2197,XXXII,
2198,XXXII,Just then Sordino’s foe was entering
2199,XXXII,The bar-room with a smile of exultation;--
2200,XXXII,"The salt arose and held him by the arm,"
2201,XXXII,"The soldier looked at him with small alarm,"
2202,XXXII,"Or rather with a frown of irritation,"
2203,XXXII,"And sought the drunken sailor from him fling,--"
2204,XXXII,
2205,XXXII,"Who brawled aloud: “Thou Judas ’Scarioth,"
2206,XXXII,Who would again for thirty shillings sell
2207,XXXII,"Our holy Mary’s son, look on my face"
2208,XXXII,"As one who helped thee in thy wicked ways,"
2209,XXXII,"To make a fortune on a stolen bell,"
2210,XXXII,Inscribed with glory to Lord Zebaoth!”
2211,XXXII,
2212,XXXII,"“I knew not better then, but now I do,--"
2213,XXXII,"Those bells, we freighted, were but stolen good,"
2214,XXXII,"And thou the thief, enriched by robbing God,--"
2215,XXXII,"Thou thinkest, all are resting ’neath the sod,"
2216,XXXII,"Who knew their tale, but by the holy Rood,"
2217,XXXII,There is one yet alive who’ll make thee rue!”
2218,XXXII,
2219,XXXII,At which the soldier grasped his sword to fight;
2220,XXXII,The sailor laughed: “Strik’st thou the weaponless?”
2221,XXXII,"He fell upon the floor, stabbed in the breast."
2222,XXXII,Then rose Sordino and to all confest:
2223,XXXII,"“I am the man behind this sorry mess,"
2224,XXXII,But will take pains to settle it aright.”
2225,XXXII,
2226,XXXII,"He drew his sword and challenging his rival,"
2227,XXXII,"They bore upon each other with a fury,"
2228,XXXII,"Which in Sordino reached a double strength,"
2229,XXXII,"He felt that fate had brought him this, at length,"
2230,XXXII,"Not even the Archbishop of Canterbury,"
2231,XXXII,Could stop him now from being the survival.
2232,XXXII,
2233,XXXII,The parries of the combatants revealed
2234,XXXII,"Their mastery in fencing, and it seemed"
2235,XXXII,"A doubtful issue who should win the fray,"
2236,XXXII,When suddenly besides the sailor lay
2237,XXXII,"The soldier with a gash, from which there streamed"
2238,XXXII,"A flood of life, the young man’s doom was sealed."
2239,XXXII,
2240,XXXII,That night the sailor and the soldier perished;
2241,XXXII,Sordino and his page set out on flight;
2242,XXXII,But Stella and her father mourned the loss
2243,XXXII,"Of one whom they thought gold, but was mere dross,--"
2244,XXXII,"A fortune-soldier with no sense of right,"
2245,XXXII,Who nought but selfish aims had ever cherished.
2246,XXXII,
2247,XXXII,A double life may win the noblest heart
2248,XXXII,"By hiding foulness neath pretended good,"
2249,XXXII,"Until the judgment-day reveals the truth,"
2250,XXXII,"And to the innocent the crushing ruth,"
2251,XXXII,"When he, that trusted was, is understood,"
2252,XXXII,And all dissemblings from his life depart.
2253,XXXII,
2254,XXXII,
2255,XXXIII,XXXIII
2256,XXXIII,
2257,XXXIII,"The foot is fleet when conscience spurs it on,"
2258,XXXIII,"And fear of death is calling in one’s trail,"
2259,XXXIII,Then lonely country roads and midnight dark
2260,XXXIII,"Seem better than the torch-illumined park,"
2261,XXXIII,Where smiling faces even a stranger hail
2262,XXXIII,On gala-nights in merry old London.
2263,XXXIII,
2264,XXXIII,"And to possess a trusted friend, in flight,"
2265,XXXIII,"Who knows the road and place of safe retreat,"
2266,XXXIII,"Is more than thousand when all things are well,"
2267,XXXIII,His whispered counsel more than when they yell
2268,XXXIII,"Their loud approval in the hour of heat,"
2269,XXXIII,"While wine is flowing, on a banquet night."
2270,XXXIII,
2271,XXXIII,"The boy did follow him, and strange to tell,"
2272,XXXIII,"The monk had offered him his services,"
2273,XXXIII,"And led the way, for much he traversed had"
2274,XXXIII,"The country near and far. Sordino, glad"
2275,XXXIII,"To grasp this straw of help in his distress,"
2276,XXXIII,Did follow him through lane and murky dell.
2277,XXXIII,
2278,XXXIII,"Amid its trees a hermit’s hut did stand,"
2279,XXXIII,Upon whose door the monk three times did knock;
2280,XXXIII,"“Who’s there?” a voice did clearly ask within,"
2281,XXXIII,The monk replied: “Thy well-known brother Quinn;”
2282,XXXIII,"The door did ope, a man in cloister-frock"
2283,XXXIII,Appeared with light and crucifix in hand.
2284,XXXIII,
2285,XXXIII,"“Grant to us all a shelter over night,"
2286,XXXIII,"True sons of Holy Church, though fugitives,"
2287,XXXIII,"Not without recompense shall be thy care,"
2288,XXXIII,"For though we nothing in our hands do bear,"
2289,XXXIII,"This gentleman no favors e’er receives,"
2290,XXXIII,Without a thanks which lingers with delight.”
2291,XXXIII,
2292,XXXIII,"“I do not covet payment for a favor,”"
2293,XXXIII,"The hermit answered, “hospitality"
2294,XXXIII,"Is but a duty upon all enjoined,"
2295,XXXIII,And deeds of kindness into lucre coined
2296,XXXIII,Cannot in heaven as holy treasures be
2297,XXXIII,"Stored up, since of man’s selfishness they savor.”"
2298,XXXIII,
2299,XXXIII,"“But I would know who comes to hermit’s cot,"
2300,XXXIII,With fear upon his face and hard of breath.”
2301,XXXIII,To which the monk replied: “A man of rank
2302,XXXIII,"From that most classic land, where Dante drank"
2303,XXXIII,"From the clear fountain which o’ercometh death,"
2304,XXXIII,Gives hope to hearts whose is the exile’s lot.”
2305,XXXIII,
2306,XXXIII,“As ’neath the temple in Jerusalem
2307,XXXIII,"A fountain issued forth all sweet and clear,"
2308,XXXIII,"So doth from mother-church a well-spring flow,"
2309,XXXIII,And all who drink thereof must feel the glow
2310,XXXIII,Of life within which makes them see and hear
2311,XXXIII,The joy that trembles round Christ’s diadem.”
2312,XXXIII,
2313,XXXIII,"“His quest is to regain some precious bells,"
2314,XXXIII,"That blessed his land, to whom his soul is wed,--"
2315,XXXIII,And on his painful journey he has found
2316,XXXIII,"The man who stole them, brought him to the ground;"
2317,XXXIII,"From dire avengers he has justly fled,"
2318,XXXIII,"Protect him thou, lest him some villain quell.”"
2319,XXXIII,
2320,XXXIII,"The hermit promised him his hut’s protection,"
2321,XXXIII,"And of a secret cave beneath a tree,"
2322,XXXIII,Meanwhile the monk and page should preparation
2323,XXXIII,"Make for departure to that stalwart nation,"
2324,XXXIII,"Whose melodies, one with its history,"
2325,XXXIII,Have from its sacred lore the true inflection.
2326,XXXIII,
2327,XXXIII,
2328,XXXIV,XXXIV
2329,XXXIV,
2330,XXXIV,With first grey dawn of day the hermit rose
2331,XXXIV,"To pray, as was his custom every morn,"
2332,XXXIV,"And with him knelt Sordino, in contrition,"
2333,XXXIV,For through the hours of night the awful vision
2334,XXXIV,"Of wanton murder to his mind was borne,"
2335,XXXIV,And robbed him of all rest and soul-repose.
2336,XXXIV,
2337,XXXIV,"And to the holy man he did confess,"
2338,XXXIV,"And begged his absolution, which was granted,"
2339,XXXIV,"But still the deed so weighed upon his heart,"
2340,XXXIV,"That when his two companions did depart,"
2341,XXXIV,"He fain would have his own death-dirges chanted,"
2342,XXXIV,To make an end of harrowing distress.
2343,XXXIV,
2344,XXXIV,"Such is the soul, that once attuned to peace,"
2345,XXXIV,"Must pass through Becca’s vale of dark remorse,"
2346,XXXIV,In whom the joy of heav’n and grief of hell
2347,XXXIV,Are seeking one another to expel;
2348,XXXIV,Well then if the afflicted take recourse
2349,XXXIV,To Him who calms the storm and gives surcease.
2350,XXXIV,
2351,XXXIV,"The ruing of our sins, the soul’s repentance,"
2352,XXXIV,"The coming to oneself, and meeting God,"
2353,XXXIV,"Is, after all, the only way to rest,"
2354,XXXIV,"All else is but a vain and foolish quest,"
2355,XXXIV,"A hiding from the terror of His rod,"
2356,XXXIV,A coward’s quailing for a righteous sentence.
2357,XXXIV,
2358,XXXIV,"For it is then, and only then, the Father"
2359,XXXIV,"Can meet His child, such as it left His home,"
2360,XXXIV,Bestow the kiss of pardon and the love
2361,XXXIV,"Of ring and raiment from His treasure trove,"
2362,XXXIV,"And bid him to the Palace with Him come,"
2363,XXXIV,There with the tranquil spirits ever gather.
2364,XXXIV,
2365,XXXIV,"Sordino now, like Israel of old,"
2366,XXXIV,"Passed through the inner struggle with the Lord,"
2367,XXXIV,"Until the morning of his soul appeared,"
2368,XXXIV,"And with the light of victory him cheered,"
2369,XXXIV,"The brook of bitter weeping he did ford,"
2370,XXXIV,And found beyond the comfort of God’s fold.
2371,XXXIV,
2372,XXXIV,
2373,XXXV,XXXV
2374,XXXV,
2375,XXXV,"Deem it not strange that men of deeper thought,"
2376,XXXV,"Retired to solitudes of woods and mountains,"
2377,XXXV,"Where, by a life of pray’r and contemplation,"
2378,XXXV,"They strove to find the soul’s complete salvation,"
2379,XXXV,"And drink of heaven’s unpolluted fountains,"
2380,XXXV,And comprehend what God for man hath wrought.
2381,XXXV,
2382,XXXV,"The solitude, in which the hermit dwelt,"
2383,XXXV,"Was deep and undisturbed by human strife,"
2384,XXXV,"No sound was heard but nature’s matchless tones,"
2385,XXXV,"Its song, the cry, the sigh, the wandering moans,"
2386,XXXV,"Which lift the poet’s vision to a life,"
2387,XXXV,"That has no language, but alone is felt."
2388,XXXV,
2389,XXXV,"Such quiet is a balm for wretched minds,"
2390,XXXV,A cooling water to the soul athirst;
2391,XXXV,"Sordino drank it like the cup of grace,"
2392,XXXV,"In which you see the Saviour’s crownèd face,"
2393,XXXV,"God spoke to him, not as to Cain accurst,"
2394,XXXV,"But as a father, in the whispering winds."
2395,XXXV,
2396,XXXV,
2397,XXXVI,XXXVI
2398,XXXVI,
2399,XXXVI,"Towards eve, that day, arrived his faithful aid,"
2400,XXXVI,Who after stealthy search had found a ship
2401,XXXVI,"For Ireland bound, to sail that very night;"
2402,XXXVI,"And in the dark, before the moon rose bright,"
2403,XXXVI,"They might into its hiding safely slip,--"
2404,XXXVI,The captain willing to be doubly paid.
2405,XXXVI,
2406,XXXVI,"So, as the dusk grew on, the kindly dusk,--"
2407,XXXVI,Which like a mother’s weeping love embraces
2408,XXXVI,"Her guilty child, to pardon, shield and hide,"
2409,XXXVI,"Close to her breast, where nothing shall betide"
2410,XXXVI,Him but the shelter from the cruel faces
2411,XXXVI,"Of an avenging world,--he rose to busk"
2412,XXXVI,
2413,XXXVI,"With his companions, yet, ere he took leave,"
2414,XXXVI,"He prayed the hermit’s blessing on his soul,"
2415,XXXVI,"Then put a golden pound within his palms,"
2416,XXXVI,"The hermit thanked him for his gen’rous alms,"
2417,XXXVI,"Then blessed him with the cross, yea, blessed them all,"
2418,XXXVI,"And bid them fare in hope, and not to grieve."
2419,XXXVI,
2420,XXXVI,"Then they departed to a little boat,"
2421,XXXVI,"Hid in a wooded nook upon the river,"
2422,XXXVI,"And in the darkness for the ship set out,"
2423,XXXVI,"And Quinn, who plied the oars, did make the route,"
2424,XXXVI,"Without a blunder, to the “Guadalquiver,”--"
2425,XXXVI,As proud a galleon as was afloat.
2426,XXXVI,
2427,XXXVI,
2428,XXXVII,XXXVII
2429,XXXVII,
2430,XXXVII,"When man has lost the moorings of his home,"
2431,XXXVII,"And on the sea of life is tossed about,"
2432,XXXVII,"Bereft of childhood’s anchorage of heart,"
2433,XXXVII,"Nor wife, nor child have in his life a part,"
2434,XXXVII,"Then cares he little for the farewell shout,"
2435,XXXVII,And sometimes little whither he may roam.
2436,XXXVII,
2437,XXXVII,"Not so with children, when the evening-star,"
2438,XXXVII,"In the cerulean, like mother-eye,"
2439,XXXVII,"Sends forth its heavenly gleam of love and peace,--"
2440,XXXVII,"The longing for the home doth then increase,"
2441,XXXVII,And from the soul goes up a bitter cry
2442,XXXVII,"To be with those so dear, but so afar."
2443,XXXVII,
2444,XXXVII,"Sordino’s page stood at the railing, as"
2445,XXXVII,"The ship bore down the Thames, that star-lit night,"
2446,XXXVII,"And none did mark the tears that trickled fast,"
2447,XXXVII,And none did see the glances which he cast
2448,XXXVII,"Towards the home which was his soul’s delight,"
2449,XXXVII,"While farther, farther from it he did pass."
2450,XXXVII,
2451,XXXVII,"Sordino missed him, sitting in the hold,"
2452,XXXVII,"And asked his new-found friend to bring him down,"
2453,XXXVII,And as he came and stood in the dim glow
2454,XXXVII,"Of candle-light, at once with pain he saw"
2455,XXXVII,"The redness of his eyes, so large and brown,"
2456,XXXVII,"And felt his hands, that they were strangely cold."
2457,XXXVII,
2458,XXXVII,"And he did put his arm around his neck,"
2459,XXXVII,"And lowly spoke with tenderness and cheer,"
2460,XXXVII,"That he should see again the home he loved,"
2461,XXXVII,And him with goodly promises endowed
2462,XXXVII,Of favors that would make each coming year
2463,XXXVII,As carefree as the sailors on the deck.
2464,XXXVII,
2465,XXXVII,
2466,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
2467,XXXVIII,
2468,XXXVIII,The sea attracts the soul that deeply yearns
2469,XXXVIII,"For freedom and adventure, like the iron"
2470,XXXVIII,"Which is by magnet drawn; and so it be,"
2471,XXXVIII,That ’mongst the cruder natures one may see
2472,XXXVIII,"The dreamer’s eye of Masefield or a Byron,"
2473,XXXVIII,Or wit and humor of a Robert Burns.
2474,XXXVIII,
2475,XXXVIII,"And sailors love to sing, or tell a tale,"
2476,XXXVIII,"Songs set to music by the wave and wind,"
2477,XXXVIII,"And yarns with tang and laughter of the deep,"
2478,XXXVIII,And on a day when all things seem asleep
2479,XXXVIII,"In golden calm, you best may find"
2480,XXXVIII,The squatting crew itself of these avail.
2481,XXXVIII,
2482,XXXVIII,On such a day a sailor-lad did sing
2483,XXXVIII,A little lay which to Sordino’s page
2484,XXXVIII,"Had spirit-flight, as never he had known,"
2485,XXXVIII,It was to him the lifting of a dawn
2486,XXXVIII,"From night’s and sorrow’s dark and fearful cage,"
2487,XXXVIII,The skylark’s rise and soar on raptured wing.
2488,XXXVIII,
2489,XXXVIII,"“Adieu, my native land, adieu,"
2490,XXXVIII,"I leave thee for a while,"
2491,XXXVIII,"As fade thy cliffs amid the blue,"
2492,XXXVIII,And trembling of thy smile!
2493,XXXVIII,"I sing my parting song with tears,"
2494,XXXVIII,"But not as cravens do,"
2495,XXXVIII,Thy love casts out the coward’s fears
2496,XXXVIII,And leaves a courage true.”
2497,XXXVIII,
2498,XXXVIII,“For England’s sons did ever find
2499,XXXVIII,"Their strength in love of thee,"
2500,XXXVIII,"Thy name, a lode-star to their mind,"
2501,XXXVIII,Guides o’er the stormy sea;
2502,XXXVIII,They breathe it as the lover does
2503,XXXVIII,Her’s whom he most adores;
2504,XXXVIII,And where the English standard goes
2505,XXXVIII,Her name lights up the shores.”
2506,XXXVIII,
2507,XXXVIII,"“There is a land far in the west,"
2508,XXXVIII,"Bright with the sun-set’s glow,"
2509,XXXVIII,"Arising from the billow’s crest,"
2510,XXXVIII,"With mountain-peaks of snow,"
2511,XXXVIII,"With palms and roses in the vales,"
2512,XXXVIII,"And fountain-gleams among,"
2513,XXXVIII,"And rich as any fairy-tale,"
2514,XXXVIII,In gold and fruit and song.”
2515,XXXVIII,
2516,XXXVIII,“And men have sailed the weary leagues
2517,XXXVIII,"To find this wondrous realm,"
2518,XXXVIII,"Have spurned the danger and fatigues,"
2519,XXXVIII,"And waves that overwhelm,"
2520,XXXVIII,"To reach that land, but none returned"
2521,XXXVIII,"To England from his quest,"
2522,XXXVIII,Unless his heart within him burned
2523,XXXVIII,With thanks for what is best.”
2524,XXXVIII,
2525,XXXVIII,“For English isles is Paradise
2526,XXXVIII,"To every native child,"
2527,XXXVIII,Since things more precious he doth price
2528,XXXVIII,"Than riches of the wild,"
2529,XXXVIII,"The gold of love is more than all,"
2530,XXXVIII,"And faith more rare than gems,"
2531,XXXVIII,He heeds not the alluring call
2532,XXXVIII,And glittering diadems.”
2533,XXXVIII,
2534,XXXVIII,"“He loves his land, he loves his God,"
2535,XXXVIII,"Be riches what they may,"
2536,XXXVIII,The bleeding Christ upon the rood
2537,XXXVIII,"Protects him on his way,"
2538,XXXVIII,"And meets he luck, as it may hap"
2539,XXXVIII,"To any sailor boy,"
2540,XXXVIII,"He brings it to his mother’s lap,"
2541,XXXVIII,"Her thanks, his greatest joy.”"
2542,XXXVIII,
2543,XXXVIII,"“Adieu, adieu, my native land,"
2544,XXXVIII,"Adieu, my father’s home,"
2545,XXXVIII,"Adieu my lass, O, may thy hand"
2546,XXXVIII,Greet me when back I come!
2547,XXXVIII,"For sailor’s heart, when outward bound,"
2548,XXXVIII,"Is filled with sorrow’s pain,"
2549,XXXVIII,But hope lies glimm’ring on the sound--
2550,XXXVIII,Of coming home again.”

2553,XXXIX,XXXIX
2554,XXXIX,
2555,XXXIX,"The song was ended, and the crew’s applause"
2556,XXXIX,"Did please the lad, who sang it to his lute.--"
2557,XXXIX,The midshipman then essayed to relate
2558,XXXIX,"A story with a mystery and fate,"
2559,XXXIX,"Of queen in English castle, and a brute"
2560,XXXIX,"Whom she did love, her absent, heartless spouse."
2561,XXXIX,
2562,XXXIX,"But while he spake, the captain did appear,"
2563,XXXIX,"(Unfinished hung the story on the lips),"
2564,XXXIX,"A Spaniard would not let such story pass,"
2565,XXXIX,"Since holy was his monarch, though an ass;"
2566,XXXIX,"Castilian, yea, to the finger-tips,"
2567,XXXIX,Who for his God and king had equal fear.
2568,XXXIX,
2569,XXXIX,"But all his crew was English and did pity,"
2570,XXXIX,"Though not from love, their queen of grief and rage,"
2571,XXXIX,"The most unfortunate on any throne,"
2572,XXXIX,"Who languished in her palace sad and lone,"
2573,XXXIX,"A zealot for her faith, who dared to wage"
2574,XXXIX,A final fight for the Eternal City.
2575,XXXIX,
2576,XXXIX,"Her love for Philip was a tragedy,"
2577,XXXIX,Of whom the people spake and lent it hue
2578,XXXIX,Of fateful romance and a mystery;
2579,XXXIX,"Yea, in the night strange phantoms men did see"
2580,XXXIX,"Of things the superstitious counted true,"
2581,XXXIX,But round it all clung native sympathy.
2582,XXXIX,
2583,XXXIX,"The captain becked Sordino to his side,"
2584,XXXIX,"And spoke in accents, foreign to his men,"
2585,XXXIX,"On whom a silence fell deep as the sea’s,"
2586,XXXIX,"When, lo! there rose a curling little breeze,"
2587,XXXIX,"And then another stronger than its friend,"
2588,XXXIX,Who called on Neptune’s horses for a ride.
2589,XXXIX,
2590,XXXIX,"The captain bid the men to tend the sails,"
2591,XXXIX,And quickly did each sailor now respond;
2592,XXXIX,"The sheets were spread before the rising wind,"
2593,XXXIX,"And swiftly did they leave the coast behind,"
2594,XXXIX,"To reach the vast and sunlit mere beyond,"
2595,XXXIX,Where ocean billows surge with piercing wails.
2596,XXXIX,
2597,XXXIX,
2598,XL,XL
2599,XL,
2600,XL,"Sordino’s mind sank into gloomy night,"
2601,XL,As time grew heavy with a voyage long;
2602,XL,"He brooded on the past, and as he did,"
2603,XL,It seemed that shadows all its sunshine hid;
2604,XL,"And sickness, too, did make the man, once strong,"
2605,XL,"Feel aged, worthless, and in awful plight."
2606,XL,
2607,XL,The story by the midshipman did linger
2608,XL,"Upon his heart, increasing spectral-like,"
2609,XL,"Awaking sympathy, for he did see"
2610,XL,In Mary’s life the gathered misery
2611,XL,"Of many storms which ’gainst her soul did strike,"
2612,XL,And on a dark and hopeless deep did bring her.
2613,XL,
2614,XL,"The greatest souls must bear the greatest pain,"
2615,XL,"And sometimes sweetness turns to bitterness,"
2616,XL,"And they who for the heights have been appointed,"
2617,XL,"And by the gods or fates have been anointed,"
2618,XL,"Must know the “Welt-smertz” of the vintage press,"
2619,XL,"And tread it all alone, may be in vain."
2620,XL,
2621,XL,"Thus did he meditate, and pleasure found"
2622,XL,"In philosophic musings, day by day;"
2623,XL,"But this was unknown to the hardy crew,"
2624,XL,"Who melancholy with their laughter slew,"
2625,XL,"They liked him not, and wished him out of way,--"
2626,XL,Well that he had the captain to him bound.
2627,XL,
2628,XL,"Alas, to him the Chimes of life were lost!"
2629,XL,And that they ever rang seemed but a dream;
2630,XL,The boist’rous elements of sea and air
2631,XL,"Enveloped him, but little did he care,"
2632,XL,"Since death itself a friend to him did seem,--"
2633,XL,"Of all things weary, sick and tempest-tost."
2634,XL,
2635,XL,"But in such hours, whene’er the boy drew near,"
2636,XL,"Whom he did love, a light shone in his eyes,"
2637,XL,And he did speak to him so tenderly
2638,XL,"As any parent, which did set him free"
2639,XL,"From painful broodings and the low’ring skies,"
2640,XL,And mid the deepest darkness brought him cheer.

2644,XLI,
2645,XLI,"’Tis not our aim to tell of voyage long,"
2646,XLI,"Of storms and struggles on the wintry seas,"
2647,XLI,"Of harbourage and waiting in its course,"
2648,XLI,"Mid sheltered inlets upon Ireland’s shores,"
2649,XLI,"Though full of hardship, yet it would not please,"
2650,XLI,And we must draw to close our lengthy song.
2651,XLI,
2652,XLI,"But I have seen full many a ship depart,"
2653,XLI,"Receding into dimness gray and cold,"
2654,XLI,"Then slip away, lost in a mighty void;--"
2655,XLI,And in my musings I have tugged and toyed
2656,XLI,"With memories of friends, or what they told,"
2657,XLI,In words that strayed from an unguarded heart.
2658,XLI,
2659,XLI,"For “wise words” are, sometimes, but foolish mumbling,"
2660,XLI,"And critic’s arrogance a dark conceit,"
2661,XLI,While silence often has the truest depth;
2662,XLI,"But when the child, which in thy bosom slept,"
2663,XLI,"Awakes to speak, a morning light doth greet"
2664,XLI,The restless trav’ler in his painful stumbling.
2665,XLI,
2666,XLI,"For there are seas, and many a distant shore,"
2667,XLI,"And life is but a journey and a fight,"
2668,XLI,Amid the mighty elements at war;--
2669,XLI,"But by-and-by the pilgrimage is o’er,"
2670,XLI,"And when the peaceful harbor is in sight,"
2671,XLI,Love’s word alone can ope the Palace-door.

2676,XLII,Upon an April morn the ship emerged
2677,XLII,From fitful seas into the placid pool
2678,XLII,"Of Limerick. The day was clear and calm,"
2679,XLII,"And nature drew the breath of spring, its balm"
2680,XLII,"Was tempering the breezes, somewhat cool,"
2681,XLII,"From western realms, where ocean-billows surged."
2682,XLII,
2683,XLII,"The woods and lanes stood draped in flimsy veil,"
2684,XLII,Of hues most delicate; a purple shade
2685,XLII,"Uniting with a tender touch of green,"
2686,XLII,While here and there a golden glint was seen
2687,XLII,"Of butter-cups upon the sloping glade,"
2688,XLII,"Or round the ponds, where fleecy clouds did sail."
2689,XLII,
2690,XLII,"The skylark, lavishing its melody"
2691,XLII,"Upon the freedom of the airy height,"
2692,XLII,"Did carol from the lofty blue so long,"
2693,XLII,"That not of earth but heaven seemed its song,"
2694,XLII,"An Ariel amid the dazzling light,"
2695,XLII,Who thrilled the heart of man with ecstasy.
2696,XLII,
2697,XLII,Sordino harkened to this happy flood
2698,XLII,"Of music, and he saw his servant boy"
2699,XLII,"Gaze upward, like the holy men that day,"
2700,XLII,"When Christ ascended, for it did allay"
2701,XLII,"His sorrows, and like theirs, restore his joy,"
2702,XLII,Since skylark song is in the English blood.
2703,XLII,
2704,XLII,For have not Wordsworth and great Shelley proven
2705,XLII,"That none it stirs just like the British heart,"
2706,XLII,"To whom the lark gave immortality,"
2707,XLII,"When it inspired them with its poesy,"
2708,XLII,"And made their odes the acme of their art,"
2709,XLII,Creations from Apollo’s texture woven?
2710,XLII,
2711,XLII,"Sordino’s mind, however, at that hour,"
2712,XLII,Lacked the repose which was on land and sea;
2713,XLII,"And without mood no music doth arrest,--"
2714,XLII,"For by an eagerness he was possest,"
2715,XLII,"To know in truth if this the shore might be,"
2716,XLII,Which held his treasure in Cathedral tower.
2717,XLII,
2718,XLII,"The fire of his Italian blood awoke,"
2719,XLII,"Though he had aged so much upon this journey,"
2720,XLII,"He longed to leave the ship, and pass along"
2721,XLII,"The river, which was famous made in song,"
2722,XLII,"By the immortal Moore, and quaint Mahoney,"
2723,XLII,Whose “Shannon Bells” remain a master-stroke.
2724,XLII,
2725,XLII,"Sordino’s wish, to be the first to land,"
2726,XLII,"Was granted, and a boat placed to his service,"
2727,XLII,"Manned by two sailors and the monk and page,"
2728,XLII,The former only did the oars engage;
2729,XLII,"Sordino, in the stern, sat like a dervise,"
2730,XLII,"In musings deep, with head posed on his hand."
2731,XLII,
2732,XLII,No finer vista could itself unfold
2733,XLII,"Than that which burst upon his dreamy eye,"
2734,XLII,"As full in view the city did appear,"
2735,XLII,"A sight which drew from weary hearts a tear,--"
2736,XLII,"A city glimmering twixt sea and sky,"
2737,XLII,"With citadels and shrines, even then, so old."
2738,XLII,
2739,XLII,The sailors left off rowing and gave way
2740,XLII,"To dreaming on the scene, until a spell"
2741,XLII,"Possest them all, and silent did they rest"
2742,XLII,"Upon the river’s calm, translucent breast,"
2743,XLII,When all at once the clear tone of a bell
2744,XLII,Came floating softly o’er the tranquil bay.
2745,XLII,
2746,XLII,And then a hymn of praise rose up to heaven
2747,XLII,"From bells whose tongues had notes beyond compare,"
2748,XLII,"Sordino’s chimes--when on his ears they fell,"
2749,XLII,"He knew such happiness which none can tell,"
2750,XLII,And angel hands to Paradise did bear
2751,XLII,The soul who for true harmony had striven.
2752,XLII,
2753,XLII,"As riveted he sat with empty stare,"
2754,XLII,Even when the soul had from its temple fled;
2755,XLII,"The boy did note it first and gave a cry,"
2756,XLII,It was to him as if his sire did die;
2757,XLII,"The monk did say a prayer o’er the dead,"
2758,XLII,And bid the sailors to the city fare.
2759,XLII,
2760,XLII,They buried him within the hallowed pale
2761,XLII,"Of the Cathedral, that the Chimes might sound"
2762,XLII,"Their daily dirge above the master’s grave,"
2763,XLII,"Who for their music life and fortune gave,"
2764,XLII,"Who with their mystery his fate had bound,"
2765,XLII,A lonely pilgrim through a gloomy vale.
2766,XLII,
2767,XLII,"His sacrifice, howe’er, was not in vain,"
2768,XLII,"And not amiss his oft belittled quest,"
2769,XLII,"His poet’s mantle fell upon the lad,"
2770,XLII,"To whom his substance he bequeathéd had,--"
2771,XLII,"A singer he became, among the best,"
2772,XLII,With cadence of the Chimes in lyric strain.
2773,XLII,
2774,XLII,"And through his faith the faithless was restored,"
2775,XLII,"The quondam monk became a godly priest,"
2776,XLII,"Who humbly made the message of the bells,"
2777,XLII,"A life of peace where discord often dwells,"
2778,XLII,"To tell of this strange man he never ceast,"
2779,XLII,Since he his name and memory adored.
2780,XLII,
2781,XLII,"And on the Danube, in her father’s hall,"
2782,XLII,"Sat Stella, sorrowing her youth away,"
2783,XLII,"The people said, it was for her dead lover;"
2784,XLII,"But none did know, and none did e’er discover"
2785,XLII,"The secret of her heart, until one day,"
2786,XLII,Her father heard her on Sordino call.

2797,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Its lofty spire seems golden in the sun;
2798,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Around it mighty elm-trees spread their boughs

2814,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Before the Christ whose saint they slew, they built"

2833,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"But on the people’s lips, from age to age,"

2844,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Her hair was black as night, her eyes a deep"
2845,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of melancholy mystery and dreams;
2846,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Her chiselled features had the striking charm

2850,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And he espied her with a sense of fear.
2851,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Her sable garb and downcast mien betrayed
2852,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A state of grief, wherefore the kindly man,"
2853,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Led by a heartfelt sympathy, did ask"
2854,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"What great bereavement weighed upon her soul,"
2855,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"To which she answered: “Sir, I sorrow not"
2856,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For any one within this hallowed ground,"

2864,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“I see two saplings, of the mountain ash,"
2865,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Grow up, one on each side of this thy church,"

2868,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"As mighty trees above the chancel-roof,"
2869,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And when the rent shall grow sufficient wide
2870,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"To be the hiding of a prayer book,"
2871,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Then shall the church sink down and be no more.”
2872,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Then quote the priest, with frown upon his face:"
2873,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,“The house built on a rock can never sink.”
2874,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“But what is built on sand the floods destroy,”"

2882,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of his departed friend whose earthly life
2883,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Had been cut off in a most tragic way;
2884,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,His widow now bestowing on the church
2885,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Rich offerings--atonements for his deeds
2886,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of sinfulness--outweighing charity;
2887,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And while he prayed, he seemed to hear the cry"
2888,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And groaning of the soul, from out the fire"
2889,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of purgatory; supplications strong
2890,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Ascended to the mercy-seat of God
2891,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"From humble altar-steps, until he felt,"

2893,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Departing from the church, he looked about"
2894,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For that strange, mournful face; but she was gone."
2895,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Then came a thought to him, a memory"
2896,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of something which the baron him had told:
2897,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"How on a summer’s day, while on a hunt,"
2898,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"He met a maiden in a forest glen,"
2899,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A slender girl of beauty, such as he"

2901,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Who weeping told him of his fate most dire,"
2902,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"That fire should him consume, a prophesy"
2903,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"So terribly fulfilled, and now, perchance,"
2904,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The very same had prophesied to him;
2905,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"This thought possessed his mind, as home he strode,"

2918,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Of thousand flowers in the meads and vales,"
2919,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,An odor sweet--unknown to tropic clime.--
2920,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Within God’s acre stood the nodding rose
2921,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"In checkered sunlight, neath the cypress tree,"
2922,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And greeted every breeze that wandered by.
2923,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Groups of the peasant folk were gathering
2924,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"About the graves, in silent thoughtfulness,"
2925,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And some in sorrow round the recent mounds;
2926,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The air so calm and mild with fragrance filled,"
2927,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The tolling of the church bells deep and strong,"
2928,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Made this a day of sweet solemnity,"
2929,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Felt by the aged and the youth alike;
2930,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And while they lingered, lo, the sibyl came."
2931,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,From group to group a whisper passed with awe:
2932,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,“It is the sibyl!” Slowly gathering
2933,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"About her, fearing what she might pronounce,"
2934,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,They gazed upon her pale and mournful face.
2935,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“All is but vanity, all things are nought,"
2936,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"All flesh is grass, which flourisheth a while,"
2937,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Then withers, dies, and mingles with the dust,--"
2938,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Like leaves upon the trees which now are green,"
2939,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And full of juice, but in the autumn turn"
2940,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"All sear and yellow, falling to the ground,"
2941,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Whirled by the chilling blast into a heap,--"
2942,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And thus must ye return to dust some day,"
2943,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And all your work must perish, even so;"
2944,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Yea, even the church must perish on that day,"
2945,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,When crowns of mountain ash trees meet above
2946,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The chancel roof, and when the wall receives"
2947,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Within its rent a common prayer book,"
2948,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Then shall the earth engulf it, and the pride"
2949,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of generations perish in the deep.”
2950,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Thus spake the sibyl, and the fearful crowd"
2951,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Displeasure showed by mien and murmuring;
2952,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"One, much perturbed, essayed to argue thus:"
2953,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“Thy words, O woman, are but idle talk;"
2954,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"This church, built on such firm and rocky ground,"
2955,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Can never sink, such prophecy is vain;”"
2956,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,To which she answered with a sigh subdued:
2957,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,“I’ve told you only what I’ve heard and seen
2958,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,In truest vision of the things to come.”
2959,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,These words were uttered as the last bell rang
2960,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Its summons to the Mass, obeyed at once"
2961,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"By all the people, leaving her alone;"
2962,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And while they prayed, she found a resting-place"
2963,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Within the cooling shadow of the church,"
2964,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And listened to a lark that soared on high,"
2965,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Against the blue of heaven’s temple-dome,"
2966,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And to the chorus ’mongst the sighing trees,"
2967,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"But most of all did note the jack-daws cry,"
2968,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,That melancholy bird of occult hue;
2969,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"As in a trance she listened to them all,"
2970,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,To thousand voices of a summer’s day;
2971,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,But ere the Mass was ended rose and went
2972,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Along a forest path her solitary way.

2975,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,
2976,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Then after many years, upon a morn"
2977,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"In early autumn, when the aspen trees"
2978,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Were turning golden, and the starlings sang"
2979,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"In darkling flocks from meadows shorn and sear,"
2980,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The pastor took his much accustomed walk,"
2981,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,For he did love to be alone and muse
2982,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Upon the wondrous scenes around his home,"
2983,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And feel great nature’s sweet and changing moods.
2984,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Although the years had turned his hair to grey,"
2985,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And robbed his steps of elasticity,"
2986,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Still was his spirit quite susceptible
2987,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"To happiness, but more to sorrow’s touch,"
2988,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And on a day like this with feelings mixed,"
2989,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The sadness of the dying summer won,"
2990,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And thoughts of life, its purpose and its end"
2991,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Did occupy his mind as he did meet
2992,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The sibyl, by a certain turn of road;"
2993,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For twenty years he had not seen her face,"
2994,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And it did startle him to meet her now.
2995,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She, too, had changed, and silver locks adorned"
2996,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Her noble forehead, but her eyes were keen"
2997,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And piercing, even as in days of youth."
2998,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And as she stopped to speak with him, he felt"
2999,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Their searching glances knew his very soul.
3000,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“Long working-day has God ordained for thee”,"
3001,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She said, to which he sadly answered thus:"
3002,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“My life seems but a transitory dream,"
3003,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And all its efforts profitless and vain.”
3004,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"“When thou art dust, thy prayer shall be heard,”"
3005,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She said a-smiling, and passed on her way."
3006,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"He too moved on, while pondering her words,--"
3007,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The dark enigma of the prophetess.

3012,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And their fulfilment now we will relate,"
3013,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Which have their place in ages afterwards.--
3014,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The priest as well as prophetess were gone,"
3015,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And so were generations after them,"
3016,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Half hidden by the dread oblivion;
3017,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The prophecy forgotten;--but a few
3018,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Had heard it as an old tradition vague,"
3019,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A fable only, to which none gave heed,"
3020,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Though twain ash saplings grew from year to year,"
3021,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And saw at least two generations pass,"
3022,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Before their branches met above the church;
3023,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,A breach also was creeping from the ground
3024,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Up through the side-wall’s massive masonry,"
3025,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Increasing with the changes of the years,"
3026,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Two things which did recall the sibyl’s lore,"
3027,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And led the people to cut down the trees,"
3028,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,To fill the rent and hide it from man’s view.
3029,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Again they felt assured that all was well,"
3030,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,But from the roots new shoots began to grow
3031,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And unmolested through full many years.

3035,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For ages had the river sung its song,"
3036,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,A-blending with the church bells’ melody;
3037,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"May be it was the charm of liquid chimes,"
3038,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Which drew the river closer year by year,"
3039,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"But almost imperceptibly,"
3040,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Until one spring it overflowed its banks,"
3041,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And in a rage, fed by the mountain-streams,"
3042,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Did wear away the distance from the church,"
3043,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And forced its course up to the church-yard wall.
3044,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A gruesome scene it wrought, as days went by;"
3045,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The coffins in the graves began to show,"
3046,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And bones in sepulchres of old decay;
3047,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Occasionally came a musty skull
3048,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A-whirling down the maelstrom of the flood,"
3049,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And now and then a crash and splash was heard,"
3050,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"When some tall monument did tumble down,"
3051,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Its name and praise lost in the seething deep,"
3052,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For nought can man achieve but it is doomed,"
3053,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"At last, to ruin and oblivion."
3054,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And mighty trees were undermined and sank
3055,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"With loads of earth, their branches ’mid the stream,"
3056,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Like outstreched arms, imploring heav’n for help."
3057,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The people also lifted hands in prayer,"
3058,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For night and day they feared the dreadful hour,"
3059,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,When--as it seemed--the church must be destroyed.
3060,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The pastor summoned them to spend a day
3061,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,In penitence and supplication true.
3062,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"They came from far and near both old and young,"
3063,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Yea, even the sick and crippled folk were brought,"
3064,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"That all might help to lift one prayer to heaven,"
3065,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A common prayer from their humble hearts,"
3066,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Through him who knelt upon the altar stair,"
3067,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Whose voice had notes of anguish for his church.
3068,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"With tears a penitential psalm was sung,"
3069,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,On bended knee; and when again they rose
3070,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"To leave the place, they passed with downcast heads"
3071,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Out through the chancel door, beside the which"
3072,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The old time rent was plainly visible,"
3073,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And where again the mountain-ash had reached
3074,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Above the roof, and met another’s crown."
3075,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"With fear they listened to the water’s roar,"
3076,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,(Now only hundred cubits from the church)
3077,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And to the moaning of the chilly wind,"
3078,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Which bare the rainclouds o’er the naked fields.
3079,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,

3081,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,
3082,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"It was the midnight hour, and densely dark,"
3083,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"In torrents fell the rain, the thunder rolled,"
3084,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And lurid lightning gleamed across the sky,"
3085,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Its light revealing nature’s misery,"
3086,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And one lone woman groping ’mongst the graves,"
3087,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Who sought the church that she too there might
3088,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"pray,"
3089,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The only one who at the mid-day mass
3090,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Had absent been, for death had kept her home,--"
3091,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Her husband struggling with the last grim foe.
3092,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The struggle being ended, she desired"
3093,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,To share in that great prayer of the day.
3094,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,For this she stemmed the terror of the night
3095,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And spectral fear of sepulchres and shrine;
3096,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She found the door unlocked and opened it,"
3097,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She entered, crossed herself, and sought a pew,"
3098,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And fervently God’s mercy did implore.
3099,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Then something strange did happen, for behold,"
3100,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The church became with dazzling light illumed,"
3101,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And stranger still, a crowd of people streamed"
3102,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Through every door, and without footfall sound."
3103,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A congregation, not of mundane mien,"
3104,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"But glorious in countenance and dress,"
3105,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Whose utter silence seemed a breath of praise.
3106,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"They filled the seats, and by the woman sat;"
3107,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,But to her touch they were as empty space.
3108,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Up from the vaults below emerged a band of priests,"
3109,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Arrayed as in the days when each did serve
3110,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Before the altar of this selfsame church;
3111,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"All knelt; but one ascended to the Host,"
3112,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"An aged man, whose picture still adorned"
3113,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The gallery, about whose name there clung"
3114,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The legend of the sibyl’s prophecy.
3115,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"He led them in a supplication strong,"
3116,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Both for the living and the many dead,"
3117,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Whose ashes were imperiled by the flood,"
3118,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And that kind heaven would spare the sacred shrine.
3119,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Now Kyrie Eleison sang the flock,"
3120,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,With hands outstretched toward burning altar lights.
3121,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,While all the ministers exclaimed: Amen!
3122,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The woman felt such wondrous happiness,"
3123,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She thought that she had died and gone to heaven,"
3124,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Yea, all at once she felt assured of this,"
3125,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"For now she saw her husband, and near him"
3126,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Two little ones, departed years ago."
3127,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"She ran with joy to clasp them in her arms,"
3128,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,But they did vanish from her fond embrace;
3129,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Yea, all did vanish, even the heavenly lights,"
3130,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And she stood there alone in darkness gross;
3131,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The silence, too, was gone, and now the storm,"
3132,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Which raged in all its fury, took its place."
3133,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A distant rumbling noise was clearly heard,"
3134,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And then a terror-striking thunder-crash;
3135,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The church did tremble in its very depths;
3136,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The woman thought the judgment-day had come;
3137,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Her strength did fail her, and she swooned away."

3141,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"When morning o’er the mountain-tops appeared,"
3142,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"There was no cloud to hinder its approach,"
3143,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And all creation hailed its harbinger:
3144,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The first faint blushes of the snowcapped peak;
3145,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The raindrops on the grass and upon trees
3146,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Soon glittered like innumerable pearls
3147,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And diamonds on the bosom of the earth.
3148,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The hidden chorus in the woods began
3149,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Its songs of praise for the returning calm.
3150,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"In every home the frightened people ’rose,"
3151,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And hardly dared to speak what most they feared,--"
3152,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,The church destroyed--and timidly the first
3153,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Came to behold the ruins of the night;
3154,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"But when they saw the church still standing there,"
3155,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"They ran to tell the people and the priest,"
3156,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Who came with joy and found it even so.
3157,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A miracle, it seemed, had taken place:"
3158,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The raging flood had wholly disappeared,"
3159,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Its empty channel bearing witness to
3160,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,How great and terrible had been its pow’r.
3161,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,A mighty landslide from the mountain side
3162,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Had changed its course back to an ancient bed,"
3163,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And what the people thought the dreadful noise
3164,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Of their beloved sanctuary’s fall,"
3165,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Was of the rushing, rumbling earthen slide."
3166,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"How great was now their joy, when they perceived,"
3167,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,That God had heard their prayer and spared His house!
3168,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"With praise the priest across the threshold stepped,"
3169,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And many followed gladly after him,"
3170,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"To join in common, heartfelt gratitude;"
3171,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,But suddenly an unexpected scene
3172,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Possessed their souls and filled them with alarm:
3173,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Before the altar steps a woman lay,"
3174,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Stark dead, it seemed, for cold and pale was she,"
3175,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And for a moment all did hesitate
3176,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"To touch her, thinking she was surely dead,--"
3177,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"A moment--only this, for soon the priest"
3178,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Had ascertained that life was not extinct,"
3179,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,And altar-wine helped to resuscitate;
3180,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Now slowly she emerged from deadly swoon,"
3181,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And gaining consciousness at last could tell,"
3182,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Why she had come to be in such a place,"
3183,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And all the things which she had heard and seen,"
3184,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Of phantom congregation and its mass,"
3185,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,Of priests in strange array before the Host.
3186,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"They marvelled greatly at her narrative,"
3187,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,When said the pastor: “I believe forsooth
3188,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"The spirits of the dead have worshiped here,"
3189,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Joined in the prayers of their living friends,"
3190,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"And now a legend, clust’ring ’round the name"
3191,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Of him whose picture you have pointed out,"
3192,THE SIBYL’S PROPHECY,"Comes to my mind, the sibyl’s prophecy:"

3251,III,But in our heart something begins
3252,III,"To stir, and grow, and take a shape,"
3253,III,"It flings away the dismal crape,"
3254,III,And o’er our lamentation wins.
3255,III,
3256,III,"It is a flower of rarest hue,"
3257,III,"Belonging to Eternity,--"
3258,III,The blossom of the memory
3259,III,Of what in him was good and true.
3260,III,
3261,III,"With this we will his grave adorn,"
3262,III,"In summer-sun and winter’s frost,"
3263,III,"Its beauty never shall be lost,"
3264,III,But growing brighter with each morn.

3268,IV,
3269,IV,"’Tis evening, and the clouds hang low,"
3270,IV,"The rain has fall’n the livelong day,"
3271,IV,"But in the west there is a ray,"
3272,IV,A gentle gleam of evening-glow.
3273,IV,
3274,IV,"Down are the curtains and the shades,"
3275,IV,"Where hearts in silence weep and brood,"
3276,IV,"They nature’s sadness may exclude,"
3277,IV,But also that one gleam--which fades.
3278,IV,
3279,IV,"I would that she might see it now,"
3280,IV,"That which was once her soul’s delight,"
3281,IV,"That it could meet her tearful sight,"
3282,IV,From o’er the verdant hillock’s brow.
3283,IV,
3284,IV,"It would, indeed, be rude to say,"
3285,IV,"To those around the cheerless hearth,"
3286,IV,"“Arise, and smile, let grief depart,"
3287,IV,Forget the clouds which gloomed the day.”
3288,IV,
3289,IV,"For sorrow, like a swollen stream,"
3290,IV,"Must have its course, or break its bounds,"
3291,IV,And oft its bitterness redounds
3292,IV,"To joy, of which we did not dream."
3293,IV,
3294,IV,"But that sweet sunset seems to say,"
3295,IV,"“He was a good man, and a just,"
3296,IV,“You best can honor him by trust
3297,IV,“In Him who leads us day by day.”

3301,V,
3302,V,"The maple and the apple-trees,"
3303,V,"Around his home, are blossoming,"
3304,V,"There is the hum of insects’ wings,"
3305,V,The droning of the honey-bees.
3306,V,
3307,V,"This is the season, he loved best,--"
3308,V,"To labor in his garden-plot,"
3309,V,"To prune the trees that flourished not,--"
3310,V,This was to him a pleasant rest.
3311,V,
3312,V,"For he from youth was nature’s child,"
3313,V,"He loved unfeigned simplicity,"
3314,V,"He found it in the field and tree,"
3315,V,"In bird and beast, the tame and wild."
3316,V,
3317,V,"He found it in the “common” folk,"
3318,V,"He loved them, they loved him again,"
3319,V,"He was the poor and needy’s friend,"
3320,V,His feeding tramps became a joke.
3321,V,
3322,V,"For it is told, both near and far,"
3323,V,"How he the tramp led to his board,"
3324,V,"To all the best it could afford,"
3325,V,Then offered him a choice cigar.
3326,V,
3327,V,"Forgive a smile amid the tear,"
3328,V,"The simple hearts will understand,"
3329,V,"And bless the kind, unstinted hand,"
3330,V,Which gave to them new hope and cheer.
3331,V,
3332,V,"The apple trees send out their sweet,"
3333,V,"The purple pomp of maples droop,"
3334,V,"They stand alone, they stand in group,"

3342,VI,"With Sabbath peace it doth us greet,"
3343,VI,And with the risen Lord’s “All Hail!”
3344,VI,
3345,VI,It mingles with the mellow sound
3346,VI,"Of church bells calling man to prayer,"
3347,VI,"It falls upon the altar-stair,"
3348,VI,Where souls disconsolate are found.
3349,VI,
3350,VI,No more along the aisles shall move
3351,VI,"His stately figure, cloth in black,"
3352,VI,On days when other folk seemed slack
3353,VI,In the expression of their love.
3354,VI,
3355,VI,"Not to repeat a senseless creed,"
3356,VI,"Did he the house of God attend,"
3357,VI,"But none like he his ear did lend,"
3358,VI,To truth of heart and human need.
3359,VI,
3360,VI,"He was a seeker after truth,"
3361,VI,"Pursuing it on flights of thought,"
3362,VI,His mind to keenness had been wrought
3363,VI,"By constant study, even from youth."
3364,VI,
3365,VI,"He loved the truth in thought and life,"
3366,VI,"He hated sham and cunning cant,"
3367,VI,"And had a scornful smile for rant,"
3368,VI,Whose purpose was to gender strife.
3369,VI,
3370,VI,The Protestant and Catholic
3371,VI,"He judged alike from human view,"
3372,VI,"Both were his friends, if only true,"
3373,VI,The false alone a heretic.
3374,VI,
3375,VI,"No honest Faith he e’er did scorn,"
3376,VI,"But saw the human heart in all,"
3377,VI,"The upward reaching of the soul,"
3378,VI,The waiting for a better morn.
3379,VI,
3380,VI,Though he with Burns did sometimes laugh
3381,VI,"While reading “Holy Willie’s Prayer,”"
3382,VI,"Or satires, like the “Holy Fair,”"
3383,VI,Or “Holy Willie’s Epitaph.”
3384,VI,
3385,VI,For when we cease to fear and dread
3386,VI,"The phantoms of a darker age,"
3387,VI,"We read them like a comic page,"
3388,VI,And smile to think that they are dead.
3389,VI,
3390,VI,"The darkness from man’s faith cast out,"
3391,VI,"And truth and love alone its good,"
3392,VI,"Then he shall know that brotherhood,"
3393,VI,God’s greatest prophets speak about.
3394,VI,
3395,VI,"Then man the Father’s heart shall know,"
3396,VI,"The “larger Hope” and nobler meed,"
3397,VI,"Then shall his life be one grand creed,"
3398,VI,The measure of what he doth trow.
3399,VI,
3400,VI,"Was this his faith? He never told,"
3401,VI,"Except in modest daily deeds,"
3402,VI,"He said no prayers, nor counted beads,"
3403,VI,Yet was he one of God’s true fold.
3404,VI,
3405,VI,
3406,VII,VII
3407,VII,
3408,VII,There moves along the street and lane
3409,VII,A motley crowd of old and young;
3410,VII,"The nation’s anthem has been sung,"
3411,VII,A homily preached at the fane.
3412,VII,
3413,VII,It moves along to sound of fife
3414,VII,"And muffled drum, the step to aid;"
3415,VII,"The flag is to the breezes laid,"
3416,VII,A flag which bears the marks of strife.
3417,VII,
3418,VII,"These men who carried it on high,"
3419,VII,"Amid the battle’s great array,"
3420,VII,But feebly follow it to-day
3421,VII,To where their fallen comrads lie.
3422,VII,
3423,VII,"“He must increase, but I decrease,”"
3424,VII,"Thus spake the prophet long ago,"
3425,VII,"“Old Glory” has been strengthened so,"
3426,VII,“The boys in blue” may rest in peace.
3427,VII,
3428,VII,"And one by one is mustered out,"
3429,VII,"From ranks which ever thinner grow,"
3430,VII,"Soon but a remnant we shall know,"
3431,VII,A remnant in the North and South.
3432,VII,
3433,VII,So let us plant our flag and flow’r
3434,VII,"Upon their grave, in Memory,--"
3435,VII,"Of what they were--what we should be,"
3436,VII,"In this the larger, newborn hour."
3437,VII,
3438,VII,"But most of all, let us be kind"
3439,VII,"To these who linger yet a while,"
3440,VII,"Come, walk with them the last long mile,"
3441,VII,And carry those who fall behind!

3446,VIII,"He was a member of this post,"
3447,VIII,"Lieutenant of artillery,"
3448,VIII,"Great Lincoln’s gift for bravery,"
3449,VIII,Of which you never heard him boast.
3450,VIII,
3451,VIII,"At Cedar Mountain and at Reams,"
3452,VIII,"Antietam and the Wilderness,"
3453,VIII,"Cold Harbor, with its vain distress,"
3454,VIII,"And Petersburg’s dark bloody streams,"
3455,VIII,
3456,VIII,"He knew the brunt of bitter fight,"
3457,VIII,"The hardship and the painful wound,"
3458,VIII,"He knew the cost of conquered ground,"
3459,VIII,The price of freedom and of right.
3460,VIII,
3461,VIII,"He knew, indeed, that “war is hell,”"
3462,VIII,"And did not proudly speak of it,"
3463,VIII,"Although his eyes were strangely lit,"
3464,VIII,When campfire stories he did tell.
3465,VIII,
3466,VIII,"But peace was regnant in his soul,"
3467,VIII,"He dreamed about that distant day,"
3468,VIII,"When man shall know the better way,"
3469,VIII,"Of peace on earth, good will to all."
3470,VIII,
3471,VIII,"He read with sorrow of the war,"
3472,VIII,"Which Europe’s mighty nations wage,"
3473,VIII,"To him it seemed an insane rage,"
3474,VIII,Which e’en a soldier must deplore.
3475,VIII,
3476,VIII,It cast a shadow o’er his mind
3477,VIII,"To think that progress is so slow,"
3478,VIII,That highest life is still so low
3479,VIII,Among the foremost of mankind.
3480,VIII,
3481,VIII,"His peace increased, as strength declined,"
3482,VIII,"The world’s sad plight he keenly felt,"
3483,VIII,"And human hope he clearly spelt,"
3484,VIII,"In Peace alone, with Truth entwined."

3492,IX,Of our mid-summer scenery.
3493,IX,
3494,IX,"They are like dreams of other days,"
3495,IX,"Of life that was and is no more,"
3496,IX,"Except upon another shore,"
3497,IX,Beyond the sun’s prismatic rays.
3498,IX,
3499,IX,"They hang above the peaceful town,"
3500,IX,"They brood above the courthouse tower,"
3501,IX,"Like blessings on the morning hour,"
3502,IX,And on the judgments there set down.
3503,IX,
3504,IX,"Beneath the lawyer’s able brief,"
3505,IX,"Beneath the arguments set forth,"
3506,IX,"Beneath the rulings of the court,"
3507,IX,"There is a silent, manly grief."
3508,IX,
3509,IX,"The thoughts of him, who for so long"
3510,IX,"Did hold the chair within this hall,"
3511,IX,"Leap from his portrait on the wall,"
3512,IX,To men whose hearts are true and strong.
3513,IX,
3514,IX,"It seems so strange, he is not there,"
3515,IX,"To guide them with his light of law,"
3516,IX,"Who seldom failed the right to know,"
3517,IX,Whose judgments were both just and fair.
3518,IX,
3519,IX,Whose mind cut keenly through the maze
3520,IX,"Of subtlest labyrinth of guilt,"
3521,IX,"Who undeceived by lawyer’s tilt,"
3522,IX,Pursued serenely logic’s ways.
3523,IX,
3524,IX,"Was justice clear,--his heart was more,"
3525,IX,"He pitied, where the law was plain,"
3526,IX,"And but for duty, he had fain,"
3527,IX,Forgiv’n where sorrow did implore.

3536,X,
3537,X,A boy is playing with the rim
3538,X,"Of some discarded carriage-wheel,"
3539,X,"A large and rusty rim of steel,"
3540,X,Which on the lawn lends sport to him.
3541,X,
3542,X,"To me it speaks of circling years,"
3543,X,"Of circling Providence and Fate,"
3544,X,"And the return of this sad date,"
3545,X,The day of loss and bitter tears.
3546,X,
3547,X,"“Let children play” I heard him say,"

3553,X,"A song his mother sings full oft,"
3554,X,"The laddie’s voice is clear and soft,"
3555,X,An anodyne for sorrow’s pain.

3559,X,"Beneath the budding apple-tree,"
3560,X,With soaring April clouds o’er head.
3561,X,
3562,X,Clouds growing denser and more dark;
3563,X,"The rain begins to spot the ground,"
3564,X,"There is a gleam, and then a sound,"
3565,X,Which make the children stop and hark.
3566,X,

3573,XI,XI

3578,XI,The daughters of a noble man;--
3579,XI,
3580,XI,"And she whose life was one with his,--"
3581,XI,"Whose love transcends the bounds of death,--"
3582,XI,"Comes with a rose-boquet’s sweet breath,"
3583,XI,To greet his mem’ry with a kiss.
3584,XI,
3585,XI,"The heavens weep, and true hearts weep,"
3586,XI,"And in the house is evening-gloom,"
3587,XI,"They stand together in the room,"
3588,XI,Where he this hour did fall asleep.
3589,XI,
3590,XI,"Then pass into the world again,"
3591,XI,From sorrow’s holy sacrament;--
3592,XI,"To one, who lingered near, it lent,"

3603,XII,The carved stone is for the eye
3604,XII,"Of passers by, who needs be told,"
3605,XII,"In characters and numbers bold,"
3606,XII,His name; when born; when he did die.
3607,XII,
3608,XII,"To those who love, the strolling breeze"
3609,XII,"Is kindly whispering his name,"

3611,XII,Or whither all its music flees?
3612,XII,
3613,XII,"O’er those the flowers cast a spell,"
3614,XII,"The dream of a midsummer night,"
3615,XII,"And with their shapes and hues, delight"

3621,XII,He is his grandsire’s child the most.
3622,XII,
3623,XII,"The clover-blossoms, white as snow,"

3625,XII,We gather them and lightly twine
3626,XII,A garland for his comely brow.
3627,XII,
3628,XII,"Such wreath put round his tresses dark,"
3629,XII,Gives godlike aspect to the lad;
3630,XII,"He laughs and runs, his heart is glad,"
3631,XII,With gladness of a soaring lark.
3632,XII,
3633,XII,"I heard thee say, when life did slope:"

3644,THE FAREWELL,
3645,THE FAREWELL,
3646,THE FAREWELL,"’Twas here, where slopes the hill into the vale,"
3647,THE FAREWELL,"With many a roof and tow’r and heav’nward spire,"
3648,THE FAREWELL,"And rows of lofty elms,--that wan and pale"
3649,THE FAREWELL,"He gazed upon the sunset and its fire,"
3650,THE FAREWELL,"Which glowed in sky and river, on the green"
3651,THE FAREWELL,And curving hills and far-off hazy plain;
3652,THE FAREWELL,The early summer was upon the scene--
3653,THE FAREWELL,All fresh and verdant after days of rain--
3654,THE FAREWELL,"He looked upon it all with wistful eye,"
3655,THE FAREWELL,His life’s arena ere he went to die.
3656,THE FAREWELL,
3657,THE FAREWELL,"What thoughts came to him then I do not know,"
3658,THE FAREWELL,But seldom man was granted better place
3659,THE FAREWELL,"To take farewell with everything below,"
3660,THE FAREWELL,"And look into the Father’s smiling face,--"
3661,THE FAREWELL,"For nature’s Vesper, glorious with light,"
3662,THE FAREWELL,"Held sweet communion with the days of yore,"
3663,THE FAREWELL,"And blessed the deeds of service and the right,"
3664,THE FAREWELL,"The things that vanish not, forevermore;"
3665,THE FAREWELL,"And saw he this, then had his last adieu"
3666,THE FAREWELL,"No painful pang, but rather, that he knew,"
3667,THE FAREWELL,"The morrow of that evening would be fair,"
3668,THE FAREWELL,"And rich in great and good realities,"
3669,THE FAREWELL,"Though, like all pilgrims, he wist hardly where"
3670,THE FAREWELL,The homeland looms with bright felicities.
3671,THE FAREWELL,
3672,THE FAREWELL,With Cato he believed “it must be so.”
3673,THE FAREWELL,"That this strange sojourn is not all in vain,"
3674,THE FAREWELL,And that somewhere the longing soul shall know
3675,THE FAREWELL,"The meaning of the journey’s toil and pain,"
3676,THE FAREWELL,"And find the quest for which he daily strove,"
3677,THE FAREWELL,Embodied in the light of truth and love.
3678,THE FAREWELL,
3679,THE FAREWELL,"He said farewell to friends of many years,"
3680,THE FAREWELL,"As sank the sun behind the farthest ridge,"
3681,THE FAREWELL,And chilly shadows came with darksome fears
3682,THE FAREWELL,"To those who homeward turned, across the bridge;"
3683,THE FAREWELL,And he passed on with that which ne’er I see
3684,THE FAREWELL,"Without the feeling of a mystery,--"
3685,THE FAREWELL,"The train of life, the unknown destiny,"
3686,THE FAREWELL,"The ardent hopes, the crushing misery"
3687,THE FAREWELL,"It bears along, as with a magic speed,--"
3688,THE FAREWELL,"The wonder of the age, the country’s iron-steed."
3689,THE FAREWELL,
3690,THE FAREWELL,"And in its speed was hope, for at the end"
3691,THE FAREWELL,"Stood Skill and Wisdom to prolong his life,"
3692,THE FAREWELL,"And with him fared a kind and trusted friend,"
3693,THE FAREWELL,"And more than all, his e’er devoted wife,"
3694,THE FAREWELL,But Skill and Love’s most consecrated aid
3695,THE FAREWELL,"Could not prolong a life--that was complete,"
3696,THE FAREWELL,"And like a man, the last great toll he paid,"
3697,THE FAREWELL,"Unfaltering, his God and Judge to meet."
3698,THE FAREWELL,
3699,THE FAREWELL,"But we, who took his hand upon this slope,"
3700,THE FAREWELL,"With parting words, have in this fitting frame"
3701,THE FAREWELL,"Of nature placed his life of work and hope,"
3702,THE FAREWELL,"And writ upon it all his honored name,"

3715,BABY BRUCE,"Sweet flow’rs, profuse,"
3716,BABY BRUCE,I see the pearls of bitter tears
3717,BABY BRUCE,Fall on their leaves;
3718,BABY BRUCE,"Alas, that one in tender years"
3719,BABY BRUCE,So sorely grieves!
3720,BABY BRUCE,
3721,BABY BRUCE,"Yes, he was fairer than the flow’rs"
3722,BABY BRUCE,"Of rarest hue,"
3723,BABY BRUCE,His smile sweet as the morning hour’s
3724,BABY BRUCE,"Gleam in the dew,"
3725,BABY BRUCE,And as we looked into his eyes
3726,BABY BRUCE,"So large and brown,"
3727,BABY BRUCE,It seemed an angel from the skies

5396,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5397,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,(Founded on a Norwegian Folk-lore.)
5398,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5399,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5400,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,There lived in the land of Ole Bull
5401,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"A peasant-fiddler of old,"
5402,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,Whose soul with music was often more full
5403,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,Than his violin ever told.
5404,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He knew not the art of clefs and notes,"
5405,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Such seemed but some mystic runes,"
5406,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,But he heard the music that richly floats
5407,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,In nature’s unwritten tunes.
5408,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5409,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He played for the dances at many a farm,"
5410,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Led many a bridal train,"
5411,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,And everywhere did he naively charm
5412,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,The mirth-loving maid and swain;
5413,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"But sometimes he played in a lonely place,"
5414,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"When no one, perchance, was near,"
5415,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And then there was sadness in his face,"
5416,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,In his eyes a furtive tear.
5417,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5418,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"For the strains which he heard he could never play,"
5419,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Though trying it o’er and o’er,"
5420,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Forgotten they were from day to day,"
5421,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,And wandered his way no more;
5422,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Sometimes in anger he flung the thing,"
5423,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Which would not obey his soul,"
5424,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Then took it again with its broken string,"
5425,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,Like a mother her child from his fall.
5426,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5427,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,On a Christmas eve he had listened long
5428,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,To the tones in the snowy air--
5429,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"The bells that sent forth their joyous song,"
5430,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,Re-echoing here and there
5431,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"In mountain hollow or forest deep,"
5432,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Or far o’er the frozen fjord,"
5433,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"A thousand voices woke from their sleep,"
5434,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,To join in the heavenly chord.
5435,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5436,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"In the house the Christmas feast was spread,"
5437,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And he ate and drank as he should,"
5438,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"There was meat and pudding and raisin bread,"
5439,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,And the Yule-tide brew was good;
5440,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"They feasted well on that holy eve,"
5441,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And did not forget a pray’r,"
5442,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And the fiddler felt it was good to live,"
5443,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,For banished he had all care.
5444,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5445,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,In his sleep that night he seemed to see
5446,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"His room full of fairy-folk,"
5447,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,They danced about with a wondrous glee
5448,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,To the tunes their fiddler awoke--
5449,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Such tunes as he never had heard before,"
5450,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"So soft, so clear, and gay,"
5451,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Like silver ripples against a shore,"
5452,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,In the morn of a summer’s day.
5453,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5454,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He saw the player, his strings and bow,"
5455,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Each touch of his finger tips,"
5456,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"From which such gladness did overflow,"
5457,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,With pleasure of lovers’ lips;
5458,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He asked the elfin to teach him one,"
5459,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Ah, one from his repertoire,"
5460,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Which he gladly did, and when it was done,"
5461,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Another, just for encore."
5462,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5463,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He taught him three, and he taught him four,"
5464,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Yea, six, while the fairies danced,"
5465,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Till a tankard of beer fell to the floor,"
5466,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"At which the elfin glanced,"
5467,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And saw a cross on its side engraved,"
5468,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Then rose and run with a cry,"
5469,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"The fairies following, as morning waved"
5470,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,His rosy plumes in the sky.
5471,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5472,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"The peasant awoke from his fairy dream,"
5473,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Sought his fiddle, began to play,"
5474,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And strange enough, as it now may seem,"
5475,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Remembered tunes in the elfin way,"
5476,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He played them all till the day shone bright,"
5477,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"He played them all till the church bells rang,"
5478,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"To call to mass among candle lights,"
5479,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,To hear the story which angels sang.
5480,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5481,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"But neither mass, nor the homily"
5482,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,Could fix his mind on the solemn things;
5483,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"An absent look in his face one might see,"
5484,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,And his fingers moved as on fiddle-strings;
5485,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"His wife did see it and almost wept,"
5486,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,And prayed that he for sweet heaven’s sake
5487,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Might be from fairies and devils kept,"
5488,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Both when asleep, or when awake."
5489,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,

5493,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And gave the people such great delight,"
5494,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,They said they never before had heard

5498,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,
5499,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"But this he kept to himself alone,"
5500,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"For often since he the fairies saw,"

5502,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"The moon on greensward or glitt’ring snow,"
5503,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"And more and more did he learn their art,"
5504,THE FIDDLER’S CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"Yea, some did whisper, he was possest,"

5646,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,
5647,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,I saw through an half-open door
5648,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,"An aged woman’s face,"
5649,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,"Amid the sunlight on the floor,"
5650,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,Uplifted and it seemed adore

5654,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,"An open book was in her hand,"

5657,LINES ON AN OLD SONGBOOK,"And yet I thought it was most grand,"

5679,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5680,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5681,PEARLS AND PALACES,"I wandered down a dusty road,"
5682,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And spent myself to sheer fatigue,"
5683,PEARLS AND PALACES,Until I fell beneath a load
5684,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Of misery and man’s intrigue,"
5685,PEARLS AND PALACES,When all at once I saw a string
5686,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Of lustrous pearls, close by the way,"
5687,PEARLS AND PALACES,"It seemed such strange a hap and thing,"
5688,PEARLS AND PALACES,That I believed my sense astray.
5689,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5690,PEARLS AND PALACES,"But as I dared to touch the gems,"
5691,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And as I felt their soft delight,"
5692,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And saw the coloring, which hems"
5693,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The robe of dawn o’er snowcapped height,"
5694,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Play in their orbs, I felt a thrill"
5695,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Of pleasure surging through my soul,"
5696,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And then a peace, so rare and still,"
5697,PEARLS AND PALACES,Upon my restless heart to fall.
5698,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5699,PEARLS AND PALACES,"At length I rose to journey on,"
5700,PEARLS AND PALACES,"But with a new-born strength and zest,"
5701,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The burden gone, I saw the sun,"
5702,PEARLS AND PALACES,"I felt that life is heaven-blest,"
5703,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The string of pearls I treasured most,"
5704,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And guarded it with fondest care,"
5705,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Lest such a fount of joy be lost,"
5706,PEARLS AND PALACES,Lest doubt again should me ensnare.
5707,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5708,PEARLS AND PALACES,"I travelled long, at last I came"
5709,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Into a place of Palaces,"
5710,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Such as in heaven have highest fame,"
5711,PEARLS AND PALACES,But which the earthbound covet less;
5712,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The saints of old did know them well,"
5713,PEARLS AND PALACES,And gave their all that they might win
5714,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Admittance to the humblest cell,"
5715,PEARLS AND PALACES,And God’s forgiveness for their sin.
5716,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5717,PEARLS AND PALACES,Each pearl became within my hand
5718,PEARLS AND PALACES,"A key wherewith the doors to ope,"
5719,PEARLS AND PALACES,And angel guides did ready stand
5720,PEARLS AND PALACES,To point to each sincerest hope;
5721,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And dazzling glory filled the halls,"
5722,PEARLS AND PALACES,"To archéd roof the music rose,"
5723,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And master’s art adorned the walls,"
5724,PEARLS AND PALACES,And o’er it all hung sweet repose.
5725,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5726,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The first and nearest door, I tried,"
5727,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Was one a singer, long ago,"
5728,PEARLS AND PALACES,Found when distressed with pain he cried
5729,PEARLS AND PALACES,"For healing streams to him to flow,"
5730,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Then sang his praise alone to Him,"
5731,PEARLS AND PALACES,"“Who healeth all thy sicknesses,”"
5732,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And there I found a truth, now dim,"
5733,PEARLS AND PALACES,That God with health the sick can bless.
5734,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5735,PEARLS AND PALACES,Another palace-door a pearl
5736,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Swung open widely to my gaze,"
5737,PEARLS AND PALACES,And like the waves that gently curl
5738,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Upon the sunlit water’s face,"
5739,PEARLS AND PALACES,There came in waves of harmony
5740,PEARLS AND PALACES,"A thousand voices in this place,"
5741,PEARLS AND PALACES,"All promises of things to be,"
5742,PEARLS AND PALACES,And of His daily help of grace.
5743,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5744,PEARLS AND PALACES,As the orchestral melody
5745,PEARLS AND PALACES,"By variations is enhanced,"
5746,PEARLS AND PALACES,"So did his words: “Come unto me,”"
5747,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Lead jubilant; I stood entranced,--"
5748,PEARLS AND PALACES,"“Come unto me, I’ll give you rest,"
5749,PEARLS AND PALACES,"My yoke is easy, burden light,”--"
5750,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Ah, here I found all that my quest"
5751,PEARLS AND PALACES,Had sought in weariness and night.
5752,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5753,PEARLS AND PALACES,Another pearl did ope the gate
5754,PEARLS AND PALACES,"To throne-rooms of the Sovereign’s pow’r,"
5755,PEARLS AND PALACES,Where not a shadow of dark Fate
5756,PEARLS AND PALACES,Had part in any dial’s hour;
5757,PEARLS AND PALACES,But truth and righteousness and love
5758,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Did govern life and destiny,"
5759,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The Sovereign’s will, supreme above"
5760,PEARLS AND PALACES,"The ways of man, did all decree."
5761,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5762,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And in this hour of awful gloom,"
5763,PEARLS AND PALACES,"When faith is wrecked, and hope is low,"
5764,PEARLS AND PALACES,The glory from this Palace-room
5765,PEARLS AND PALACES,Makes all the mountain-peaks aglow;
5766,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And shadows flee from vale and plain,"
5767,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And struggling armies see a gleam,"
5768,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Commensurate with grief and pain,--"
5769,PEARLS AND PALACES,The truth of what seemed but a dream.
5770,PEARLS AND PALACES,
5771,PEARLS AND PALACES,"My rosary has many beads,"
5772,PEARLS AND PALACES,"I need an endless life to learn,"
5773,PEARLS AND PALACES,"To what exalted things each leads,"
5774,PEARLS AND PALACES,"For which my soul doth truly yearn,--"
5775,PEARLS AND PALACES,"And when the innermost I gain,"
5776,PEARLS AND PALACES,There hangs a cross which lights the way
5777,PEARLS AND PALACES,To Palace-portals where I fain
5778,PEARLS AND PALACES,"Would be this moment, and for aye."

5787,VICTOR HUGO,"Now long ago,"
5788,VICTOR HUGO,"In the far-off land of Norway,"
5789,VICTOR HUGO,"I sat in an open window,"
5790,VICTOR HUGO,And dreamed.
5791,VICTOR HUGO,
5792,VICTOR HUGO,The valley and hills and distant mountains
5793,VICTOR HUGO,Were all like a dream
5794,VICTOR HUGO,In the soft light and wonderful calm
5795,VICTOR HUGO,Of the night.
5796,VICTOR HUGO,
5797,VICTOR HUGO,"The odor of cherry-blossoms and birch,"
5798,VICTOR HUGO,And the mingled perfume from meadows and hills and vale
5799,VICTOR HUGO,"Wrought with a fairy-potion,"
5800,VICTOR HUGO,Dreams and thrills of the soul.
5801,VICTOR HUGO,
5802,VICTOR HUGO,The lazy smoke of the Saint John’s fire
5803,VICTOR HUGO,Like pillars rose from the wooded heights
5804,VICTOR HUGO,"To the sky cerulian,"
5805,VICTOR HUGO,"Where the evening star shone bright,"
5806,VICTOR HUGO,Like an eye that twinkles with tears of joy;
5807,VICTOR HUGO,"It shimmered above a cataract,"
5808,VICTOR HUGO,Whose music rose and fell
5809,VICTOR HUGO,Where the river leaped over the rocks to the fjord.
5810,VICTOR HUGO,
5811,VICTOR HUGO,The night had voices:
5812,VICTOR HUGO,Laughter and singing of youth round the bonfires;
5813,VICTOR HUGO,"Purling of streams, and twitter of sleepless birds;"
5814,VICTOR HUGO,"Yet all was peace, and joy, and life,"
5815,VICTOR HUGO,And mystery such as the Avon Bard
5816,VICTOR HUGO,Did see and hear on a Midsummer night.
5817,VICTOR HUGO,
5818,VICTOR HUGO,"I was but a boy, and the names of the great"
5819,VICTOR HUGO,"Were new to me, and yet not strange,--"
5820,VICTOR HUGO,I knew not why.
5821,VICTOR HUGO,"That day I had read about Hugo,"
5822,VICTOR HUGO,"That he, the greatest of singers"
5823,VICTOR HUGO,"In our own day, was dead;"
5824,VICTOR HUGO,"I felt a heart-gripping sorrow,"
5825,VICTOR HUGO,And wept as over a friend.
5826,VICTOR HUGO,
5827,VICTOR HUGO,"It seemed that his spirit was there,"
5828,VICTOR HUGO,"In the dreams of that Saint John’s night,"
5829,VICTOR HUGO,That all the fairies and flowers and streams
5830,VICTOR HUGO,"Were greeting him with a love that had sadness,"
5831,VICTOR HUGO,"And yet which rose on the wings of gladness,"
5832,VICTOR HUGO,Up to the stars.
5833,VICTOR HUGO,
5834,VICTOR HUGO,"My soul did feel it, I know not how,"
5835,VICTOR HUGO,"That he was there, a part of it all,"
5836,VICTOR HUGO,"The Highpriest of Nature, Romance and Life."

6493,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"So I set out, a boy of twelve,"
6494,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"With sled in hand to reach the pines,"
6495,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,And through the snow made for myself
6496,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,A track amid most wild confines.
6497,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6498,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,Beneath the lofty trees there stood
6499,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Full many a little evergreen,"
6500,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"And all were straight, and seemed quite good,"
6501,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,But not a perfect one was seen.
6502,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6503,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"I waded on from tree to tree,"
6504,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"And thought, at times my choice I’d found,"
6505,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"But lo, it lacked true symmetry,"
6506,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,True symmetry from top to ground.
6507,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6508,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"And thus the afternoon was spent,"
6509,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Until the evening-shadows fell,"

6513,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Its fate through all the silent wood,"
6514,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"On echoes distant, echoes near,"
6515,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,Which seemed to say in mocking mood:
6516,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,“The perfect one is here--is here!”
6517,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6518,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,My ardor for the perfect one
6519,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Subsided as I strapped my prize,"
6520,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Half of my strength was also gone,"
6521,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,And easy was the compromise.
6522,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6523,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,My basking in the new-fall’n snow
6524,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Had drenched me and brought on a chill,"
6525,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"The homeward journey, long and slow,"
6526,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,Sent me to bed severely ill.
6527,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6528,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Long was I racked with fever’s fire,"
6529,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"My life was like a flick’ring light,"
6530,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,They thought its last gleam would expire
6531,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,Amid the storm of New Year’s night.
6532,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6533,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,Thus did I almost pay full score
6534,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,For that my first and youthful quest
6535,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"For perfectness, and evermore"
6536,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,I’ve found this is her stern behest:
6537,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,
6538,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"Who would find me must give his all,"
6539,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,"And even then may sorely fail,"
6540,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,But it adds glory to the soul
6541,IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT,To walk in the Immortal’s trail.
