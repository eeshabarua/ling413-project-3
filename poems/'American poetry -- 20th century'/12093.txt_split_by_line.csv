28,DEDICATION,
29,DEDICATION,"When I began The Song of the Stone Wall, Dr. Edward Everett Hale"
30,DEDICATION,"was still among us, and it was my intention to dedicate the poem"
31,DEDICATION,to him if it should be deemed worthy of publication. I fancied that
32,DEDICATION,he would like it; for he loved the old walls and the traditions that
33,DEDICATION,cling about them.
34,DEDICATION,
35,DEDICATION,"As I tried to image the men who had built the walls long ago, it"
36,DEDICATION,seemed to me that Dr. Hale was the living embodiment of whatever was
37,DEDICATION,heroic in the founders of New England. He was a great American. He
38,DEDICATION,was also a great Puritan. Was not the zeal of his ancestors upon his
39,DEDICATION,"lips, and their courage in his heart? Had they not bequeathed to him"
40,DEDICATION,"their torch-like faith, their patient fervor of toil and their creed"
41,DEDICATION,of equality?
42,DEDICATION,
43,DEDICATION,But his bright spirit had inherited no trace of their harshness and
44,DEDICATION,gloom. The windows of his soul opened to the sunlight of a joyous
45,DEDICATION,faith. His optimism and genial humor inspired gladness and good
46,DEDICATION,sense in others. With an old story he prepared their minds to
47,DEDICATION,"receive new ideas, and with a parable he opened their hearts to"
48,DEDICATION,generous feelings. All men loved him because he loved them. They
49,DEDICATION,"knew that his heart was in their happiness, and that his humanity"
50,DEDICATION,"embraced their sorrows. In him the weak found a friend, the"
51,DEDICATION,"unprotected, a champion. Though a herald and proclaimer of peace, he"
52,DEDICATION,could fight stubbornly and passionately on the side of justice. His
53,DEDICATION,"was a lovable, uplifting greatness which drew all men near and ever"
54,DEDICATION,"nearer to God and to each other. Like his ancestors, he dreamed of a"
55,DEDICATION,land of freedom founded on the love of God and the brotherhood of
56,DEDICATION,"man, a land where each man shall achieve his share of happiness and"
57,DEDICATION,learn the work of manhoodto rule himself and lend a hand.
58,DEDICATION,
59,DEDICATION,Thoughts like these were often in my mind as the poem grew and took
60,DEDICATION,"form. It is fitting, therefore, that I should dedicate it to him,"
61,DEDICATION,and in so doing I give expression to the love and reverence which I
62,DEDICATION,"have felt for him ever since he called me his little cousin, more"
63,DEDICATION,than twenty years ago.

74,THE SONG OF,THE SONG OF
75,THE STONE WALL,THE STONE WALL
76,THE STONE WALL,
77,THE STONE WALL,
78,THE STONE WALL,"Come walk with me, and I will tell"
79,THE STONE WALL,What I have read in this scroll of stone;
80,THE STONE WALL,I will spell out this writing on hill and meadow.
81,THE STONE WALL,"It is a chronicle wrought by praying workmen,"
82,THE STONE WALL,The forefathers of our nation--
83,THE STONE WALL,Leagues upon leagues of sealed history awaiting an interpreter.
84,THE STONE WALL,This is New England's tapestry of stone
85,THE STONE WALL,Alive with memories that throb and quiver
86,THE STONE WALL,At the core of the ages
87,THE STONE WALL,As the prophecies of old at the heart of Gods Word.
88,THE STONE WALL,
89,THE STONE WALL,"The walls have many things to tell me,"
90,THE STONE WALL,And the days are long. I come and listen:
91,THE STONE WALL,"My hand is upon the stones, and the tale I fain would hear"
92,THE STONE WALL,"Is of the men who built the walls,"
93,THE STONE WALL,And of the God who made the stones and the workers.
94,THE STONE WALL,
95,THE STONE WALL,With searching feet I walk beside the wall;
96,THE STONE WALL,I plunge and stumble over the fallen stones;
97,THE STONE WALL,I follow the windings of the wall
98,THE STONE WALL,"Over the heaving hill, down by the meadow-brook,"
99,THE STONE WALL,"Beyond the scented fields, by the marsh where rushes grow."
100,THE STONE WALL,On I trudge through pine woods fragrant and cool
101,THE STONE WALL,And emerge amid clustered pools and by rolling acres of rye.
102,THE STONE WALL,"The wall is builded of field-stones great and small,"
103,THE STONE WALL,"Tumbled about by frost and storm,"
104,THE STONE WALL,Shaped and polished by ice and rain and sun;
105,THE STONE WALL,"Some flattened, grooved, and chiseled"
106,THE STONE WALL,By the inscrutable sculpture of the weather;
107,THE STONE WALL,Some with clefts and rough edges harsh to the touch.
108,THE STONE WALL,Gracious Time has glorified the wall
109,THE STONE WALL,And covered the historian stones with a mantle of green.
110,THE STONE WALL,"Sunbeams flit and waver in the rifts,"
111,THE STONE WALL,"Vanish and reappear, linger and sleep,"
112,THE STONE WALL,"Conquer with radiance the obdurate angles,"
113,THE STONE WALL,Filter between the naked rents and wind-bleached jags.
114,THE STONE WALL,
115,THE STONE WALL,I understand the triumph and the truth
116,THE STONE WALL,Wrought into these walls of rugged stone.
117,THE STONE WALL,"They are a miracle of patient hands,"
118,THE STONE WALL,"They are a victory of suffering, a paean of pain;"
119,THE STONE WALL,"All pangs of death, all cries of birth,"
120,THE STONE WALL,"Are in the mute, moss-covered stones;"
121,THE STONE WALL,They are eloquent to my hands.
122,THE STONE WALL,"O beautiful, blind stones, inarticulate and dumb!"
123,THE STONE WALL,In the deep gloom of their hearts there is a gleam
124,THE STONE WALL,Of the primeval sun which looked upon them
125,THE STONE WALL,When they were begotten.
126,THE STONE WALL,So in the heart of man shines forever
127,THE STONE WALL,A beam from the everlasting sun of God.
128,THE STONE WALL,Rude and unresponsive are the stones;
129,THE STONE WALL,Yet in them divine things lie concealed;
130,THE STONE WALL,I hear their imprisoned chant:--
131,THE STONE WALL,
132,THE STONE WALL,"""We are fragments of the universe,"
133,THE STONE WALL,Chips of the rock whereon God laid the foundation of the world:
134,THE STONE WALL,Out of immemorial chaos He wrought us.
135,THE STONE WALL,"Out of the sun, out of the tempest, out of the travail of the earth"
136,THE STONE WALL,we grew.
137,THE STONE WALL,We are wonderfully mingled of life and death;
138,THE STONE WALL,"We serve as crypts for innumerable, unnoticed, tiny forms."
139,THE STONE WALL,We are manifestations of the Might
140,THE STONE WALL,That rears the granite hills unto the clouds
141,THE STONE WALL,And sows the tropic seas with coral isles.
142,THE STONE WALL,We are shot through and through with hidden color;
143,THE STONE WALL,A thousand hues are blended in our gray substance.
144,THE STONE WALL,"Sapphire, turquoise, ruby, opal,"
145,THE STONE WALL,"Emerald, diamond, amethyst, are our sisters from the beginning,"
146,THE STONE WALL,"And our brothers are iron, lead, zinc,"
147,THE STONE WALL,Copper and silver and gold.
148,THE STONE WALL,"We are the dust of continents past and to come,"
149,THE STONE WALL,We are a deathless frieze carved with man's destiny;
150,THE STONE WALL,In us is the record sibylline of far events.
151,THE STONE WALL,"We are as old as the world, our birth was before the hills."
152,THE STONE WALL,We are the cup that holds the sea
153,THE STONE WALL,And the framework of the peak that parts the sky.
154,THE STONE WALL,"When Chaos shall again return,"
155,THE STONE WALL,"And endless Night shall spread her wings upon a rained world,"
156,THE STONE WALL,"We alone shall stand up from the shattered earth,"
157,THE STONE WALL,"Indestructible, invincible witnesses of Gods eternal purpose."
158,THE STONE WALL,
159,THE STONE WALL,In reflective mood by the wall I wander;
160,THE STONE WALL,The hoary stones have set my heart astir;
161,THE STONE WALL,My thoughts take shape and move beside me in the guise
162,THE STONE WALL,Of the stern men who built the wall in early olden days.
163,THE STONE WALL,"One by one the melancholy phantoms go stepping from me,"
164,THE STONE WALL,And I follow them in and out among the stones.
165,THE STONE WALL,"I think of the days long gone,"
166,THE STONE WALL,Flown like birds beyond the ramparts of the world.
167,THE STONE WALL,"The patient, sturdy men who piled the stones"
168,THE STONE WALL,"Have vanished, like the days, beyond the bounds"
169,THE STONE WALL,Of earth and mortal things.
170,THE STONE WALL,"From their humble, steadfast lives has sprung the greatness of my"
171,THE STONE WALL,nation.
172,THE STONE WALL,"I am bone of their bone, breath of their breath,"
173,THE STONE WALL,Their courage is in my soul.
174,THE STONE WALL,The wall is an Iliad of granite: it chants to me
175,THE STONE WALL,"Of pilgrims of the perilous deep,"
176,THE STONE WALL,Of fearless journeyings and old forgotten things.
177,THE STONE WALL,The blood of grim ancestors warms the fingers
178,THE STONE WALL,That trace the letters of their story;
179,THE STONE WALL,My pulses beat in unison with pulses that are stilled;
180,THE STONE WALL,The fire of their zeal inspires me
181,THE STONE WALL,In my struggle with darkness and pain.
182,THE STONE WALL,"These embossed books, unobliterated by the tears and laughter"
183,THE STONE WALL,"of Time,"
184,THE STONE WALL,Are signed with the vital hands of undaunted men.
185,THE STONE WALL,"I love these monoliths, so crudely imprinted"
186,THE STONE WALL,"With their stalwart, cleanly, frugal lives."
187,THE STONE WALL,
188,THE STONE WALL,From my seat among the stones I stretch my hand and touch
189,THE STONE WALL,"My friend the elm, urnlike, lithesome, tall."
190,THE STONE WALL,Far above the reach of my exploring fingers
191,THE STONE WALL,Birds are singing and winging joyously
192,THE STONE WALL,Through leafy billows of green.
193,THE STONE WALL,The elm-trees song is wondrous sweet;
194,THE STONE WALL,The words are the ancientest language of trees--
195,THE STONE WALL,They tell of how earth and air and light
196,THE STONE WALL,Are wrought anew to beauty and to fruitfulness.
197,THE STONE WALL,I feel the glad stirrings under her rough bark;
198,THE STONE WALL,Her living sap mounts up to bring forth leaves;
199,THE STONE WALL,Her great limbs thrill beneath the wand of spring.
200,THE STONE WALL,
201,THE STONE WALL,This wall was builded in our fathers days--
202,THE STONE WALL,Valorous days when life was lusty and the land was new.
203,THE STONE WALL,"Resemble the walls the builders, buffeted, stern, and worn."
204,THE STONE WALL,"To us they left the law,"
205,THE STONE WALL,"Order, simplicity, obedience,"
206,THE STONE WALL,And the wall is the bond they gave the nation
207,THE STONE WALL,At its birth of courage and unflinching faith.
208,THE STONE WALL,"Before the epic here inscribed began,"
209,THE STONE WALL,They wrote their course upon a trackless sea.
210,THE STONE WALL,"O, tiny craft, bearing a nations seed!"
211,THE STONE WALL,"Frail shallop, quick with unborn states!"
212,THE STONE WALL,"Autumn was mellow in the fatherland when they set sail,"
213,THE STONE WALL,And winter deepened as they neared the West.
214,THE STONE WALL,"Out of the desert sea they came at last,"
215,THE STONE WALL,And their hearts warmed to see that frozen land.
216,THE STONE WALL,"O, first gray dawn that filtered through the dark!"
217,THE STONE WALL,"Bleak, glorious birth-hour of our northern states!"
218,THE STONE WALL,They stood upon the shore like new created men;
219,THE STONE WALL,"On barren solitudes of sand they stood,"
220,THE STONE WALL,"The conquered sea behind, the unconquered wilderness before."
221,THE STONE WALL,"Some died that year beneath the cruel cold,"
222,THE STONE WALL,And some for heartsick longing and the pang
223,THE STONE WALL,Of homes remembered and souls torn asunder.
224,THE STONE WALL,That spring the new-plowed field for bread of life
225,THE STONE WALL,Bordered the new-dug acre marked for death;
226,THE STONE WALL,"Beside the springing corn they laid in the sweet, dark earth"
227,THE STONE WALL,"The young man, strong and free, the maiden fair and trustful,"
228,THE STONE WALL,"The little child, and the uncomplaining mother."
229,THE STONE WALL,
230,THE STONE WALL,"Across the meadow, by the ancient pines,"
231,THE STONE WALL,"Where I, the child of life that lived that spring,"
232,THE STONE WALL,"Drink in the fragrances of the young year,"
233,THE STONE WALL,The field-wall meets one grimly squared and straight.
234,THE STONE WALL,"Beyond it rise the old tombs, gray and restful,"
235,THE STONE WALL,And the upright slates record the generations.
236,THE STONE WALL,"Stiffly aslant before the northern blasts,"
237,THE STONE WALL,"Like the steadfast, angular beliefs"
238,THE STONE WALL,"Of those whom they commemorate, the headstones stand,"
239,THE STONE WALL,Cemented deep with moss and invisible roots.
240,THE STONE WALL,"The rude inscriptions charged with faith and love,"
241,THE STONE WALL,"Graceless as Death himself, yet sweet as Death,"
242,THE STONE WALL,Are half erased by the impartial storms.
243,THE STONE WALL,As children lisping words which move to laughter
244,THE STONE WALL,"Are themselves poems of unconscious melody,"
245,THE STONE WALL,So the old gravestones with their crabbed muse
246,THE STONE WALL,"Are beautiful for their halting words of faith,"
247,THE STONE WALL,Their groping love that had no gift of song.
248,THE STONE WALL,But all the broken tragedy of life
249,THE STONE WALL,And all the yearning mystery of death
250,THE STONE WALL,Are celebrated in sweet epitaphs of vines and violets.
251,THE STONE WALL,Close by the wall a peristyle of pines
252,THE STONE WALL,Sings requiem to all the dead that sleep.
253,THE STONE WALL,
254,THE STONE WALL,"Beyond the village churchyard, still and calm,"
255,THE STONE WALL,"Steeped in the sweetness of eternal morn,"
256,THE STONE WALL,The wall runs down in crumbling cadence
257,THE STONE WALL,Beside the brook which plays
258,THE STONE WALL,Through the land like a silver harp.
259,THE STONE WALL,"A wind of ancient romance blows across the field,"
260,THE STONE WALL,A sweet disturbance thrills the air;
261,THE STONE WALL,"The silken skirts of Spring go rustling by,"
262,THE STONE WALL,And the earth is astir with joy.
263,THE STONE WALL,"Up the hill, romping and shaking their golden heads,"
264,THE STONE WALL,Come the little children of the wood.
265,THE STONE WALL,From ecstasy to ecstasy the year mounts upward.
266,THE STONE WALL,"Up from the south come the odor-laden winds,"
267,THE STONE WALL,"Angels and ministers of life,"
268,THE STONE WALL,Dropping seeds of fruitfulness
269,THE STONE WALL,Into the bosoms of flowers.
270,THE STONE WALL,"Elusive, alluring secrets hide in wood and hedge"
271,THE STONE WALL,Like the first thoughts of love
272,THE STONE WALL,In the breast of a maiden;
273,THE STONE WALL,The witchery of love is in rock and tree.
274,THE STONE WALL,"Across the pasture, star-sown with daisies,"
275,THE STONE WALL,"I see a young girl--the spirit of spring she seems,"
276,THE STONE WALL,Sister of the winds that run through the rippling daisies.
277,THE STONE WALL,"Sweet and clear her voice calls father and brother,"
278,THE STONE WALL,And one whose name her shy lips will not utter.
279,THE STONE WALL,But a chorus of leaves and grasses speaks her heart
280,THE STONE WALL,And tells his name: the birches flutter by the wall;
281,THE STONE WALL,The wild cherry-tree shakes its plumy head
282,THE STONE WALL,And whispers his name; the maple
283,THE STONE WALL,Opens its rosy lips and murmurs his name;
284,THE STONE WALL,The marsh-marigold sends the rumor
285,THE STONE WALL,"Down the winding stream, and the blue flag"
286,THE STONE WALL,Spread the gossip to the lilies in the lake:
287,THE STONE WALL,All Natures eyes and tongues conspire
288,THE STONE WALL,In the unfolding of the tale
289,THE STONE WALL,That Adam and Eve beneath the blossoming rose-tree
290,THE STONE WALL,Told each other in the Garden of Eden.
291,THE STONE WALL,"Once more the wind blows from the walls,"
292,THE STONE WALL,And I behold a fair young mother;
293,THE STONE WALL,She stands at the lilac-shaded door
294,THE STONE WALL,With her baby at her breast;
295,THE STONE WALL,She looks across the twilit fields and smiles
296,THE STONE WALL,And whispers to her child: Thy father comes!
297,THE STONE WALL,
298,THE STONE WALL,Life triumphed over many-weaponed Death.
299,THE STONE WALL,Sorrow and toil and the wilderness thwarted their stout invasion;
300,THE STONE WALL,But with the ship that sailed again went no retreating soul!
301,THE STONE WALL,"Stubborn, unvanquished, clinging to the skirts of Hope,"
302,THE STONE WALL,"They kept their narrow foothold on the land,"
303,THE STONE WALL,And the ship sailed home for more.
304,THE STONE WALL,With yearlong striving they fought their way into the forest;
305,THE STONE WALL,"Their axes echoed where I sit, a score of miles from the sea."
306,THE STONE WALL,"Slowly, slowly the wilderness yielded"
307,THE STONE WALL,To smiling grass-plots and clearings of yellow corn;
308,THE STONE WALL,And while the logs of their cabins were still moist
309,THE STONE WALL,"With odorous sap, they set upon the hill"
310,THE STONE WALL,"The shrine of liberty for mans mind,"
311,THE STONE WALL,"And by it the shrine of liberty for mans soul,"
312,THE STONE WALL,The school-house and the church.
313,THE STONE WALL,
314,THE STONE WALL,The apple-tree by the wall sheds its blossom about me--
315,THE STONE WALL,A shower of petals of light upon darkness.
316,THE STONE WALL,From Natures brimming cup I drink a thousand scents;
317,THE STONE WALL,At noon the wizard sun stirs the hot soil under the pines.
318,THE STONE WALL,I take the top stone of the wall in my hands
319,THE STONE WALL,And the sun in my heart;
320,THE STONE WALL,"I feel the rippling land extend to right and left,"
321,THE STONE WALL,Bearing up a receptive surface to my uncertain feet;
322,THE STONE WALL,I clamber up the hill and beyond the grassy sweep;
323,THE STONE WALL,I encounter a chaos of tumbled rocks.
324,THE STONE WALL,"Piles of shadow they seem, huddling close to the land."
325,THE STONE WALL,"Here they are scattered like sheep,"
326,THE STONE WALL,"Or like great birds at rest,"
327,THE STONE WALL,There a huge block juts from the giant wave of the hill.
328,THE STONE WALL,At the foot of the aged pines the maidens moccasins
329,THE STONE WALL,Track the sod like the noiseless sandals of Spring.
330,THE STONE WALL,"Out of chinks in the wall delicate grasses wave,"
331,THE STONE WALL,As beauty grew out of the crannies of these hard souls.
332,THE STONE WALL,
333,THE STONE WALL,"Joyously, gratefully, after their long wrestling"
334,THE STONE WALL,"With the bitter cold and the harsh white winter,"
335,THE STONE WALL,They heard the step of Spring on the edge of melting snow-drifts;
336,THE STONE WALL,"Gladly, with courage that flashed from their life-beaten souls,"
337,THE STONE WALL,"As the fire-sparks fly from the hammered stone,"
338,THE STONE WALL,They hailed the fragrant arbutus;
339,THE STONE WALL,Its sweetness trailed beside the path that they cut through the
340,THE STONE WALL,"forest,"
341,THE STONE WALL,And they gave it the name of their ship Mayflower.
342,THE STONE WALL,"Beauty was at their feet, and their eyes beheld it;"
343,THE STONE WALL,"The earth cried out for labor, and they gave it."
344,THE STONE WALL,"But ever as they saw the budding spring,"
345,THE STONE WALL,"Ever as they cleared the stubborn field,"
346,THE STONE WALL,"Ever as they piled the heavy stones,"
347,THE STONE WALL,"In mystic vision they saw, the eternal spring;"
348,THE STONE WALL,"They raised their hardened hands above the earth,"
349,THE STONE WALL,"And beheld the walls that are not built of stone,"
350,THE STONE WALL,The portals opened by angels whose garments are of light;
351,THE STONE WALL,And beyond the radiant walls of living stones
352,THE STONE WALL,They dreamed vast meadows and hills of fadeless green.
353,THE STONE WALL,
354,THE STONE WALL,In the old house across the road
355,THE STONE WALL,"With weather-beaten front, like the furrowed face of an old man,"
356,THE STONE WALL,"The lights are out forever, the windows are broken,"
357,THE STONE WALL,And the oaken posts are warped;
358,THE STONE WALL,The storms beat into the rooms as the passion of the world
359,THE STONE WALL,Racked and buffeted those who once dwelt in them.
360,THE STONE WALL,The psalm and the morning prayer are silent.
361,THE STONE WALL,But the walls remain visible witnesses of faith
362,THE STONE WALL,That knew no wavering or shadow of turning.
363,THE STONE WALL,"They have withstood sun and northern blast,"
364,THE STONE WALL,They have outlasted the unceasing strife
365,THE STONE WALL,Of forces leagued to tear them down.
366,THE STONE WALL,"Under the stars and the clouds, under the summer sun,"
367,THE STONE WALL,"Beaten by rain and wind, covered with tender vines,"
368,THE STONE WALL,"The walls stand symbols of a granite race,"
369,THE STONE WALL,The measure and translation of olden times.
370,THE STONE WALL,
371,THE STONE WALL,"In the rough epic of their life, their toil, their creeds,"
372,THE STONE WALL,"Their psalms, their prayers, what stirring tales"
373,THE STONE WALL,Of days that were their past had they to tell
374,THE STONE WALL,Their children to keep the new faith burning?
375,THE STONE WALL,Tales of grandsires in the fatherland
376,THE STONE WALL,"Whose faith was seven times tried in fiery furnaces,--"
377,THE STONE WALL,"Of Rowland Taylor who kissed the stake,"
378,THE STONE WALL,And stood with hands folded and eyes steadfastly turned
379,THE STONE WALL,"To the sky, and smiled upon the flames;"
380,THE STONE WALL,"Of Latimer, and of Cranmer who for cowardice heroically atoned--"
381,THE STONE WALL,Who thrust his right hand into the fire
382,THE STONE WALL,Because it had broken plight with his heart
383,THE STONE WALL,And written against the voice of his conviction.
384,THE STONE WALL,With such memories they exalted and cherished
385,THE STONE WALL,"The heroism of their tried souls,"
386,THE STONE WALL,And ours are wrung with doubt and self-distrust!
387,THE STONE WALL,
388,THE STONE WALL,I am kneeling on the odorous earth;
389,THE STONE WALL,"The sweet, shy feet of Spring come tripping oer the land,"
390,THE STONE WALL,"Winter is fled to the hills, leaving snowy wreaths"
391,THE STONE WALL,"On apple-tree, meadow, and marsh."
392,THE STONE WALL,The walls are astir; little waves of blue
393,THE STONE WALL,Run through my fingers murmuring:
394,THE STONE WALL,We follow the winds and the snow!
395,THE STONE WALL,Their heart is a cup of gold.
396,THE STONE WALL,Soft whispers of showers and flowers
397,THE STONE WALL,Are mingled in the spring song of the walls.
398,THE STONE WALL,Hark to the songs that go singing like the wind
399,THE STONE WALL,Through the chinks of the wall and thrill the heart
400,THE STONE WALL,And quicken it with passionate response!
401,THE STONE WALL,"The walls sing the song of wild bird, the hoof-beat of deer,"
402,THE STONE WALL,"The murmur of pine and cedar, the ripple of many streams;"
403,THE STONE WALL,Crows are calling from the Druidical wood;
404,THE STONE WALL,The morning mist still haunts the meadows
405,THE STONE WALL,Like the ghosts of the wall builders.
406,THE STONE WALL,
407,THE STONE WALL,"As I listen, methinks I hear the bitter plaint"
408,THE STONE WALL,"Of the passing of a haughty race,"
409,THE STONE WALL,"The wronged, friendly, childlike, peaceable tribes,"
410,THE STONE WALL,"The swarthy archers of the wilderness,"
411,THE STONE WALL,"The red men to whom Nature opened all her secrets,"
412,THE STONE WALL,"Who knew the haunts of bird and fish,"
413,THE STONE WALL,The hidden virtue of herb and root;
414,THE STONE WALL,All the travail of man and beast they knew--
415,THE STONE WALL,"Birth and death, heat and cold,"
416,THE STONE WALL,"Hunger and thirst, love and hate;"
417,THE STONE WALL,For these are the unchanging things writ in the imperishable book of
418,THE STONE WALL,life
419,THE STONE WALL,That man suckled at the breast of woman must know.
420,THE STONE WALL,
421,THE STONE WALL,In the dim sanctuary of the pines
422,THE STONE WALL,The winds murmur their mysteries through dusky aisles--
423,THE STONE WALL,Secrets of earths renewal and the endless cycle of life.
424,THE STONE WALL,Living things are afoot among the grasses;
425,THE STONE WALL,"The closed fingers of the ferns unfold,"
426,THE STONE WALL,"New bees explore new flowers, and the brook"
427,THE STONE WALL,Pours virgin waters from the rushing founts of May.
428,THE STONE WALL,In the old walls there are sinister voices--
429,THE STONE WALL,The groans of women charged with witchcraft.
430,THE STONE WALL,"I see a lone, gray, haggard woman standing at bay,"
431,THE STONE WALL,"Helpless against her grim, sin-darkened judges."
432,THE STONE WALL,Terror blanches her lips and makes her confess
433,THE STONE WALL,Bonds with demons that her heart knows not.
434,THE STONE WALL,Satan sits by the judgment-seat and laughs.
435,THE STONE WALL,"The gray walls, broken, weatherworn oracles,"
436,THE STONE WALL,"Sing that she was once a girl of love and laughter,"
437,THE STONE WALL,"Then a fair mother with lullabies on her lips,"
438,THE STONE WALL,"Caresses in her eyes, who spent her days"
439,THE STONE WALL,In weaving warmth to keep her brood against the winter cold.
440,THE STONE WALL,And in her tongue was the law of kindness;
441,THE STONE WALL,For her God was the Lord Jehovah.
442,THE STONE WALL,"Enemies uprose and swore her accused,"
443,THE STONE WALL,"Laid at her door the writhing forms of little children,"
444,THE STONE WALL,And she could but answer: The Evil One
445,THE STONE WALL,Torments them in my shape.
446,THE STONE WALL,She stood amazed before the tribunal of her church
447,THE STONE WALL,And heard the gate of Gods house closed against her.
448,THE STONE WALL,"Oh, shuddering silence of the throng,"
449,THE STONE WALL,And fearful the words spoken from the judgment-seat!
450,THE STONE WALL,She raised her white head and clasped her wrinkled hands:
451,THE STONE WALL,"Pity me, Lord, pity my anguish!"
452,THE STONE WALL,"Nor, since Thou art a just and terrible God,"
453,THE STONE WALL,Forget to visit thy wrath upon these people;
454,THE STONE WALL,For they have sworn away the life of Thy servant
455,THE STONE WALL,Who hath lived long in the land keeping Thy commandments.
456,THE STONE WALL,"I am old, Lord, and betrayed;"
457,THE STONE WALL,By neighbor and kin am I betrayed;
458,THE STONE WALL,A Judas kiss hath marked me for a witch.
459,THE STONE WALL,Possessed of a devil?  Here be a legion of devils!
460,THE STONE WALL,"Smite them, O God, yea, utterly destroy them that persecute the innocent."
461,THE STONE WALL,Before this mother in Israel the judges cowered;
462,THE STONE WALL,But still they suffered her to die.
463,THE STONE WALL,"Through the tragic, guilty walls I hear the sighs"
464,THE STONE WALL,"Of desolate women and penitent, remorseful men."
465,THE STONE WALL,
466,THE STONE WALL,"Sing of happier themes, O many-voiced epic,"
467,THE STONE WALL,"Sing how the ages, like thrifty husbandmen, winnow the creeds of"
468,THE STONE WALL,"men,"
469,THE STONE WALL,And leave only faith and love and truth.
470,THE STONE WALL,"Sing of the Puritans nobler nature,"
471,THE STONE WALL,"Fathomless as the forests he felled,"
472,THE STONE WALL,Irresistible as the winds that blow.
473,THE STONE WALL,His trenchant conviction was but the somber bulwark
474,THE STONE WALL,Which guarded his pure ideal.
475,THE STONE WALL,"Resolute by the communion board he stood,"
476,THE STONE WALL,And after solemn prayer solemnly cancelled
477,THE STONE WALL,And abolished the divine right of kings
478,THE STONE WALL,And declared the holy rights of man.
479,THE STONE WALL,"Prophet and toiler, yearning for other worlds, yet wise in this;"
480,THE STONE WALL,"Scornful of earthly empire and brooding on death,"
481,THE STONE WALL,Yet wrestling life out of the wilderness
482,THE STONE WALL,And laying stone on stone the foundation of a temporal state!
483,THE STONE WALL,I see him standing at his cabin-door at eventide
484,THE STONE WALL,"With dreaming, fearless eyes gazing at sunset hills;"
485,THE STONE WALL,"In his prophetic sight Liberty, like a bride,"
486,THE STONE WALL,"Hasteth to meet her lord, the westward-going man!"
487,THE STONE WALL,"Even as he saw the citadel of Heaven,"
488,THE STONE WALL,He beheld an earthly state divinely fair and just.
489,THE STONE WALL,"Mystic and statesman, maker of homes,"
490,THE STONE WALL,"Strengthened by the primal law of toil,"
491,THE STONE WALL,"And schooled by monarch-made injustices,"
492,THE STONE WALL,"He carried the covenant of liberty with fire and sword,"
493,THE STONE WALL,And laid a rich state on frugality!
494,THE STONE WALL,"Many republics have sprung into being,"
495,THE STONE WALL,"Full-grown, equipped with theories forged in reason;"
496,THE STONE WALL,"All, all have fallen in a single night;"
497,THE STONE WALL,"But to the wise, fire-hardened Puritan"
498,THE STONE WALL,Democracy was not a blaze of glory
499,THE STONE WALL,To crackle for an hour and be quenched out
500,THE STONE WALL,By the first gust that blows across the world.
501,THE STONE WALL,"I see him standing at his cabin-door,"
502,THE STONE WALL,And all his dreams are true as when he dreamed them;
503,THE STONE WALL,But only shall they be fulfilled if we
504,THE STONE WALL,"Are mindful of the toil that gave him power,"
505,THE STONE WALL,Are brave to dare a wilderness of wrong;
506,THE STONE WALL,So long shall Nature nourish us and Spring
507,THE STONE WALL,Throw riches in the lap of man
508,THE STONE WALL,"As we beget no wasteful, weak-handed generations,"
509,THE STONE WALL,But bend us to the fruitful earth in toil.
510,THE STONE WALL,"Beyond the wall a new-plowed field lies steaming in the sun,"
511,THE STONE WALL,And down the road a merry group of children
512,THE STONE WALL,Run toward the village school.
513,THE STONE WALL,
514,THE STONE WALL,"Hear, O hear!  In the historian walls"
515,THE STONE WALL,Rises the beat and the tumult of the struggle for freedom.
516,THE STONE WALL,"Sacred, blood-stained walls, your peaceful front"
517,THE STONE WALL,Sheltered the fateful fires of Lexington;
518,THE STONE WALL,"Builded to fence green fields and keep the herds at pasture,"
519,THE STONE WALL,Ye became the frowning breastworks of stern battle;
520,THE STONE WALL,"Lowly boundaries of the freemans farm,"
521,THE STONE WALL,Ye grew the rampart of a land at war;
522,THE STONE WALL,And still ye cross the centuries
523,THE STONE WALL,Between the ages of monarchs and the age
524,THE STONE WALL,When farmers in their fields are kings.
525,THE STONE WALL,"From the Revolution the young Republic emerged,"
526,THE STONE WALL,"She mounted up as on the wings of the eagle,"
527,THE STONE WALL,"She ran and was not weary, and all the children of the world"
528,THE STONE WALL,Joined her and followed her shining path.
529,THE STONE WALL,"But ever as she ran, above her lifted head"
530,THE STONE WALL,Darkened the monster cloud of slavery.
531,THE STONE WALL,"Hark!  In the walls, amid voices of prayer and of triumph,"
532,THE STONE WALL,I hear the clank of manacles and the ominous mutterings of bondsmen!
533,THE STONE WALL,"At Gettysburg, our Golgotha, the sons of the fathers"
534,THE STONE WALL,Poured their blood to wash out a nations shame.
535,THE STONE WALL,"Cleansed by tribulation and atonement,"
536,THE STONE WALL,"The broken nation rose from her knees,"
537,THE STONE WALL,And with hope reborn in her heart set forth again
538,THE STONE WALL,Upon the open road to ideal democracy.
539,THE STONE WALL,
540,THE STONE WALL,"Sing, walls, in lightning words that shall cause the world to"
541,THE STONE WALL,"vibrate,"
542,THE STONE WALL,"Of the democracy to come,"
543,THE STONE WALL,"Of the swift, teeming, confident thing!"
544,THE STONE WALL,We are part of it--the wonder and the terror and the glory!
545,THE STONE WALL,"Fearless we rush forward to meet the years,"
546,THE STONE WALL,The years that come flying towards us
547,THE STONE WALL,"With wings outspread, agleam on the horizon of time!"
548,THE STONE WALL,
549,THE STONE WALL,"O eloquent, sane walls, instinct with a new faith,"
550,THE STONE WALL,"Ye are barbarous, in congruous, but great with the greatness of"
551,THE STONE WALL,reality.
552,THE STONE WALL,"Walls wrought in unfaltering effort,"
553,THE STONE WALL,"Sing of our prosperity, the joyous harvest"
554,THE STONE WALL,Of the labor of lusty toilers.
555,THE STONE WALL,Down through the years comes the ring of their victorious axes:
556,THE STONE WALL,"Ye are titans of the forest, but we are stronger;"
557,THE STONE WALL,"Ye are strong with the strength of mighty winds,"
558,THE STONE WALL,But we are strong with the unconquerable strength of souls!
559,THE STONE WALL,"Still the young race, unassailable, inviolate,"
560,THE STONE WALL,Shakes the solitudes with the strokes of creation;
561,THE STONE WALL,"Doubly strong we renew the valorous days,"
562,THE STONE WALL,And like a measureless sea we overflow
563,THE STONE WALL,"The fresh green, benevolent West,"
564,THE STONE WALL,"The buoyant, fruitful West that dares and sings!"
565,THE STONE WALL,"Pure, dew-dripping walls that guard"
566,THE STONE WALL,"The quiet, lovable, fertile fields,"
567,THE STONE WALL,Sing praises to Him who from the mossy rocks
568,THE STONE WALL,Can bid the fountains leap in thirsty lands.
569,THE STONE WALL,"I walk beside the stones through the young grain,"
570,THE STONE WALL,Through waves of wheat that billow about my knees.
571,THE STONE WALL,The walls contest the onward march of the wheat;
572,THE STONE WALL,But the wheat is charged with the life of the world;
573,THE STONE WALL,"Its force is irresistible; onward it sweeps,"
574,THE STONE WALL,"An engulfing tide, over all the land,"
575,THE STONE WALL,"Till hill and valley, field and plain"
576,THE STONE WALL,Are flooded with its green felicity!
577,THE STONE WALL,Out of the moist earth it has sprung;
578,THE STONE WALL,"In the gracious amplitudes of her bosom it was nurtured,"
579,THE STONE WALL,And in it is wrought the miracle of life.
580,THE STONE WALL,
581,THE STONE WALL,"Sing, prophetic, mystic walls, of the dreams of the builders;"
582,THE STONE WALL,Sing in thundering tones that shall thrill us
583,THE STONE WALL,"To try our dull discontent, our barren wisdom"
584,THE STONE WALL,"Against their propagating, unquenchable, questionless visions."
585,THE STONE WALL,"Sing in renerving refrain of the resolute men,"
586,THE STONE WALL,"Each a Lincoln in his smoldering patience,"
587,THE STONE WALL,"Each a Luther in his fearless faith,"
588,THE STONE WALL,Who made a breach in the wall of darkness
589,THE STONE WALL,And let the hosts of liberty march through.
590,THE STONE WALL,
591,THE STONE WALL,"Calm, eternal walls, tranquil, mature,"
592,THE STONE WALL,"Which old voices, old songs, old kisses cover,"
593,THE STONE WALL,"As mosses and lichens cover your ancient stones,"
594,THE STONE WALL,Teach me the secret of your serene repose;
595,THE STONE WALL,"Tell of the greater things to be,"
596,THE STONE WALL,"When love and wisdom are the only creed,"
597,THE STONE WALL,And law and right are one.
598,THE STONE WALL,"Sing that the Lord cometh, the Lord cometh,"
599,THE STONE WALL,The fountain-head and spring of life!
600,THE STONE WALL,"Sing, steady, exultant walls, in strains hallowed and touched with"
601,THE STONE WALL,"fire,"
602,THE STONE WALL,Sing that the Lord shall build us all together.
603,THE STONE WALL,"As living stones build us, cemented together."
604,THE STONE WALL,May He who knoweth every pleasant thing
605,THE STONE WALL,"That our sires forewent to teach the peoples law and truth,"
606,THE STONE WALL,"Who counted every stone blessed by their consecrated hands,"
607,THE STONE WALL,"Grant that we remain liberty-loving, substantial, elemental,"
608,THE STONE WALL,"And that faith, the rock not fashioned of human hands,"
609,THE STONE WALL,"Be the stability of our triumphant, toiling days."
