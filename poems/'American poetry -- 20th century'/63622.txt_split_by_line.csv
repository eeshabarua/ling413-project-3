182,THE BLACK PANTHER,There is a panther caged within my breast;
183,THE BLACK PANTHER,"But what his name, there is no breast shall know"
184,THE BLACK PANTHER,"Save mine, nor what it is that drives him so,"
185,THE BLACK PANTHER,"Backward and forward, in relentless quest--"
186,THE BLACK PANTHER,"That silent rage, baffled but unsuppressed,"
187,THE BLACK PANTHER,The soft pad of those stealthy feet that go
188,THE BLACK PANTHER,"Over my body’s prison to and fro,"
189,THE BLACK PANTHER,Trying the walls forever without rest.

191,THE BLACK PANTHER,All day I feed him with my living heart;
192,THE BLACK PANTHER,"But when the night puts forth her dreams and stars,"

194,THE BLACK PANTHER,"His wrath is hurled upon the trembling bars,"
195,THE BLACK PANTHER,"The eternal passion stretches me apart,"
196,THE BLACK PANTHER,And I lie silent--but my body shakes.

217,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Soft owl, or moth, and timid, twittering things--"
218,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Move through the growing dark; on furtive wings
219,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,The bat flits overhead.
220,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
221,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,And in the house
222,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"The death-watch ticks, the dust of time is stirred"
223,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"With timorous footfalls, in the night is heard"
224,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,The gnawing of the mouse.
225,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
226,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Through the old room
227,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"What phantoms throng, what shapes that to and fro"
228,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Tremble, and lips that laughed here long ago--"
229,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Gone back into the gloom!
230,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
231,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,A whip-poor-will
232,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Bleakly across the baleful country cries
233,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,From a blurred mouth; and from the west replies
234,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Echo--and all is still.
235,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
236,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Now from her shell,"
237,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Her body’s prison, with the ancient doubt"
238,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"And terror stricken, the scared soul looks out,"
239,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Asking if all be well.
240,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
241,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Great kings have been,"
242,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Poets, and mighty prophets--shapes have cried"
243,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"About the world, or moved in mournful pride;"
244,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,And are no longer seen.
245,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
246,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,From many lands
247,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Their plaint was lifted; from how many a shore
248,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Sorrows have wailed, that are not any more!"
249,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,They sleep with folded hands.
250,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
251,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,They have their day:
252,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Their cry is loud about the earth, who come"
253,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,To the one end; the singing lips grow dumb
254,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Always in the one way.
255,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
256,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Though they implore,"
257,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Brief is the plea, inflexible the fate!"
258,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Silence has the last word; and then--the great
259,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Silence, forevermore."
260,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
261,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Pondering these,"
262,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,The fretful spirit in bewilderment
263,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Quickens with a vague doubt, and, not content,"
264,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Broods--and is ill at ease.
265,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
266,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Her being is
267,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Throned on so frail a pulse; such fleeting breath
268,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Bears up her dream across the gulf of death
269,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,And the obscure abyss.
270,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
271,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Always she hears
272,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"The hurtling chariots of the hurrying blood,"
273,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Her shuttling breath that in the solitude
274,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Weaves the one self she wears.
275,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
276,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Now first the vast
277,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Veil over heaven is rent, and bares the whole"
278,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Shining Reality; whereat the soul
279,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Sickens, and is aghast!"
280,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
281,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Darkness reveals
282,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,The tragic truth; her will sinks hopeless wings
283,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Before the inexorable Fact of things,"
284,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Humbling the dread she feels.
285,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
286,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,With the old Awes
287,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Confronted and the flaming Mystery,"
288,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"She may not speak; but pondering, suddenly"
289,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Grows silent, and withdraws."
290,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
291,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,She may not bear
292,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"That sight: the spangled heavens, from east to west,"
293,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Stretch out too wide the confines of the breast,"
294,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Straining in wonder there.
295,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
296,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Upon what Brow
297,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Of awful eminence--O thought that stuns!--
298,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Is laid that chaplet of a million suns,"
299,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Upon what Forehead now?
300,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
301,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Who was it wrought
302,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"This universal glory all around,"
303,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Of glittering worlds forever without bound?--
304,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Great Poet, what a Thought!"
305,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
306,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,It is a Word
307,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Unutterable that is written there;
308,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"The spirit, gazing, is one voiceless prayer,"
309,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Careless if it be heard.
310,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
311,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Her thoughts ascend,"
312,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Star beyond star, height beyond aching height"
313,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Upward, in adoration infinite,"
314,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Forever, without end."
315,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
316,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,So _shall_ it be!
317,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Till heaven yield her sceptre; till the throne
318,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,"Of night be shaken, and the Face be known"
319,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Beyond eternity:
320,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,
321,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Till God divide
322,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,And rend asunder the embroidered hem
323,NIGHT HAS ITS FEAR,Of darkness; till the starry diadem

345,THE SORROWFUL MASQUERADE,"And mocks her tears. But when the pipings sleep,"

1174,THE FISH-HAWK,"Unbounded between sea and heaven, while twilight screened"
1175,THE FISH-HAWK,"The sorrowful distances, he moved and had repose;"
1176,THE FISH-HAWK,On the huge wind of the Immensity he leaned
1177,THE FISH-HAWK,His steady body in long lapse of flight--and rose
1178,THE FISH-HAWK,
1179,THE FISH-HAWK,"Gradual, through broad gyres of ever-climbing rest,"
1180,THE FISH-HAWK,"Up the clear stair of the eternal sky, and stood"
1181,THE FISH-HAWK,"Throned on the summit! Slowly, with his widening breast,"
1182,THE FISH-HAWK,"Widened around him the enormous Solitude,"
1183,THE FISH-HAWK,From the gray rim of ocean to the glowing west.
1184,THE FISH-HAWK,
1185,THE FISH-HAWK,"Headlands and capes forlorn of the far coast, the land"
1186,THE FISH-HAWK,"Rolling her barrens toward the south, he, from his throne"

1193,THE FISH-HAWK,"Arches and endless aisles of vacancy, the fair"
1194,THE FISH-HAWK,Void of sheer heights and hollows hailed him as her lord
1195,THE FISH-HAWK,"And lover in the highest, to whom all heaven lay bare!"
1196,THE FISH-HAWK,
1197,THE FISH-HAWK,"Till from that tower of ecstasy, that baffled height,"
1198,THE FISH-HAWK,"Stooping, he sank; and slowly on the world’s wide way"
1199,THE FISH-HAWK,"Walked, with great wing on wing, the merciless, proud Might,"
1200,THE FISH-HAWK,Hunting the huddled and lone reaches for his prey
1201,THE FISH-HAWK,Down the dim shore--and faded in the crumbling light.
1202,THE FISH-HAWK,
1203,THE FISH-HAWK,Slowly the dusk covered the land. Like a great hymn
1204,THE FISH-HAWK,The sound of moving winds and waters was; the sea
1205,THE FISH-HAWK,"Whispered a benediction, and the west grew dim"

1342,A LEAVE-TAKING,"That last, sweet night in the Old World long ago,"
1343,A LEAVE-TAKING,The last ere my departure--the dark room
1344,A LEAVE-TAKING,"That brooded ’round us, and the drowsy breath,"
1345,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Out of the courtyard, of the linden-trees,"
1346,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Pungent and sad. Only your hand I felt,"
1347,A LEAVE-TAKING,Reached to me in the darkness; and the beat
1348,A LEAVE-TAKING,"All through its fingers of the unconscious blood,"
1349,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Your life at battle, in the silence told"
1350,A LEAVE-TAKING,Immortally to mine its plaintive tale
1351,A LEAVE-TAKING,"And doom eternal--only your hand I felt,"
1352,A LEAVE-TAKING,Reached to me in the darkness--yet it seemed
1353,A LEAVE-TAKING,"In your hand’s touch I touched your very self,"
1354,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Your very presence, changeable, careless, wild--"
1355,A LEAVE-TAKING,"But O how poignant--sharp with all delight,"
1356,A LEAVE-TAKING,"And gracious with dear bounties to bestow,"
1357,A LEAVE-TAKING,"How greatly granted! Drowsily then at last,"
1358,A LEAVE-TAKING,"In the old way, you begged me for some legend"
1359,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Out of my boyhood’s record, some romance"
1360,A LEAVE-TAKING,"From the far world that bore me; and my voice,"
1361,A LEAVE-TAKING,"In the sweet, alien tongue, your mother-tongue,"
1362,A LEAVE-TAKING,Moved through the darkness with a peace unfeigned--
1363,A LEAVE-TAKING,"For a grave peace was on us, and the fear"
1364,A LEAVE-TAKING,"That thrilled the midnight, fell away. The street"
1365,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Slumbered, save where, departing, like a ghost’s,"
1366,A LEAVE-TAKING,Faint footfalls down the farthest distance sighed;
1367,A LEAVE-TAKING,And dwindled out forever.... So you slept.
1368,A LEAVE-TAKING,
1369,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Well I remember it, that night in May--"
1370,A LEAVE-TAKING,"The sleep, the hushed awakenings, full of dread,"
1371,A LEAVE-TAKING,"From haunted meres of horror and disdain,"
1372,A LEAVE-TAKING,From dreams of terror--and the mad return
1373,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Into the bounteous pity of two arms,"
1374,A LEAVE-TAKING,The comfort and the kindness. O the return
1375,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Forever and forever, wild and sad,"
1376,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Seraphic with all weariness and pain,"
1377,A LEAVE-TAKING,Insatiate with all love--as if to slake
1378,A LEAVE-TAKING,In one abandon all the desperate drought
1379,A LEAVE-TAKING,Of the years to come! Upon my own I felt
1380,A LEAVE-TAKING,"The wet, salt quivering of your lips, and all"
1381,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Your being fold me in, urgent to save,"
1382,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Urgent to hide the approaching loneliness,"
1383,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Our bitter portion; prismed in tears, the dusk"
1384,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Swam ’round with dizzy color: the nightingales,"
1385,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Beauty’s disdain above the war of things,"
1386,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Beauty’s high pity from her virgin heights,"
1387,A LEAVE-TAKING,Our meeting hearts pierced with a single pang--
1388,A LEAVE-TAKING,Like a bright sword of sorrow through the breast
1389,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Driven, and like a bruising sword withdrawn."
1390,A LEAVE-TAKING,
1391,A LEAVE-TAKING,The sun arose--
1392,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Fled were the nightingales, the love, the joy--"
1393,A LEAVE-TAKING,"And with him rose at last the relentless fear,"
1394,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Like a harsh face never to be pushed back,"
1395,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Between your face and mine; till all the terror,"
1396,A LEAVE-TAKING,"The loneliness, the irrevocable fate,"
1397,A LEAVE-TAKING,"In the dim twilight hugged me, and a cry,"
1398,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Up from _my_ self to _your_ self, would have rent"
1399,A LEAVE-TAKING,"My hesitant lips, in the great need, to you"
1400,A LEAVE-TAKING,Turned for the last compassion.... But you slept.
1401,A LEAVE-TAKING,At peace you lay. Over you in the dawn
1402,A LEAVE-TAKING,"I leaned, and knew you truly what you were."
1403,A LEAVE-TAKING,
1404,A LEAVE-TAKING,Then a great love
1405,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Triumphing over sorrow, like the light"
1406,A LEAVE-TAKING,Clearing the west when sunset’s wrath has waned
1407,A LEAVE-TAKING,Before the risen stars--a mystery--welled
1408,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Up through me radiant, helpless where you lay"
1409,A LEAVE-TAKING,"In the calm pose of sleep: and above Time,"
1410,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Our little passion, and the circumstance"
1411,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Of temporal tumult, self to self we met;"
1412,A LEAVE-TAKING,And sundered reverent.... Faintest breath of flowers
1413,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Stirred in the twilight fragrantly, and there"
1414,A LEAVE-TAKING,The pathos of our days together filled me
1415,A LEAVE-TAKING,With a new wonder--flooding on me came
1416,A LEAVE-TAKING,"A host of memories, as to one long dead,"
1417,A LEAVE-TAKING,Lifted beyond his living; till all seemed
1418,A LEAVE-TAKING,Marvellous and immortal and benign.
1419,A LEAVE-TAKING,
1420,A LEAVE-TAKING,And now
1421,A LEAVE-TAKING,The hour was come. Beside your quiet breast
1422,A LEAVE-TAKING,I begged forgiveness for my many sins
1423,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Done to you, though unwitting--all the hurt--"
1424,A LEAVE-TAKING,"In a swift prayer, and even for this last--"
1425,A LEAVE-TAKING,To wake you to your sorrow. And your lips
1426,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Forgave me--yes, in the silence. So I touched"
1427,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Your lids with kisses. And you woke, and wept."
1428,A LEAVE-TAKING,
1429,A LEAVE-TAKING,But brave to the end with a heart-breaking bravery--
1430,A LEAVE-TAKING,"Gallant and gracious, dear with sacred eyes,"
1431,A LEAVE-TAKING,You let me go. With a half-kiss we parted.

1436,II,Along the city-ways
1437,II,Already day’s vehement tumult had begun:
1438,II,"Through street and justled alley, court and square,"
1439,II,The tireless and eternal Heart poured forth
1440,II,"Its myriad human faces, grave or glad,"
1441,II,On the old course of toil (a choral hymn
1442,II,From the lips of Life) each face a testimony
1443,II,"Of some prefiguring love. O the delight,"
1444,II,The incredible bounty and sustaining will
1445,II,"Of passionate longing, peopling all the earth--"
1446,II,And the joy of man and woman! The laughing boys!
1447,II,"The milkman clanking along in his cart, and there"
1448,II,"Two bonneted old women, and there a thief,"
1449,II,"Perhaps, with a night’s booty sneaking home!"
1450,II,"Yet solemn all and sacred, with new eyes"
1451,II,"I saw them then, and in each face I seemed"
1452,II,With a new soul to read the soul beneath;
1453,II,Through love and pain and sorrow having passed
1454,II,Into the breast of all humanity--
1455,II,"Through love and sorrow. Yes, and for your sake,"
1456,II,"Being human, all things human touched to love"
1457,II,"This heart of mine, made holy; and the thought"
1458,II,Of the million other hearts beyond the dawn--
1459,II,"The gladness, and the sadness, and the pain--"
1460,II,"Came back upon me like a lifting music,"
1461,II,"Beautiful, and most sorrowful, and divine."
1462,II,
1463,II,Till a vast compassion
1464,II,Up through the springs of all my being welled
1465,II,"Intolerably! Ah, even as to myself,"
1466,II,"Unfaithful, the exuberant Bounty stooped"
1467,II,With arms of pity; so I longed to do--
1468,II,To lose myself at last in the Great Self
1469,II,"That beams upon the just and the unjust,"
1470,II,Carelessly shedding radiant light around:
1471,II,"Compassing finite hate with infinite love,"
1472,II,"With beauty, ugliness, and death with life!"
1473,II,
1474,II,"So through that street of pouring souls I passed,"
1475,II,Torn between grief and ecstasy. But none
1476,II,Guessed the immortal secret that I bore
1477,II,Close at the fluttering heart--the fear--the joy--
1478,II,"The very beat and memory in my blood,"
1479,II,The exquisite sense and lingering pain of you.

1535,THE SILENCE,"We walked again in the evening, in the warm May weather,"
1536,THE SILENCE,After the partings and tears.
1537,THE SILENCE,
1538,THE SILENCE,"And under the splendor, under the starry skies,"
1539,THE SILENCE,"We walked, without sound or sigh, in a calm unbroken;"
1540,THE SILENCE,As the dead walk together in a long-lost Paradise--
1541,THE SILENCE,"Silent, with no word spoken."

1568,EXULTATION,
1569,EXULTATION,"O life and joy and breath and death of me,"

1723,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Stare upward toward me, staring upward, too,"

1727,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Your starry heaven for the star of Man,"
1728,THE DIVINE FANTASY,High in the trellis of eternity

1739,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And saints, and lifted saviours, and sublime"
1740,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Faiths and high fortitudes beyond belief?

1750,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Some answering glimmer of the ancient Spark

1775,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"That couch the ant, it turns a tiny eye"
1776,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Around the darkness; scampers and is shy

1783,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of its stern need that roams the world, and rends"
1784,THE DIVINE FANTASY,With tooth or talon; in the hawk descends
1785,THE DIVINE FANTASY,On the stunned squirrel; in the squirrel moans
1786,THE DIVINE FANTASY,As the hawk strikes; darkens the earth with bones
1787,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of its own wreck and, hungering again,"
1788,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Knows in its body the old spur. For when

1794,THE DIVINE FANTASY,

1797,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Victor and vanquished, in one sacrament--"
1798,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Body with body--of delight and death,"
1799,THE DIVINE FANTASY,It moves in splendor; lifts the shuddering breath
1800,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of the spent stag; and in the mind of Man
1801,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Rebels against the miserable plan--
1802,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Flings its frail web of thought across the path
1803,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of suns in heaven, and in holy wrath,"
1804,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"On blood of murdered brothers nourished, still"
1805,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Thunders to all the world, _Thou shall not kill_!"
1806,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And the worm’s death is in the sparrow’s song.
1807,THE DIVINE FANTASY,
1808,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And I have seen it in the gnats that throng
1809,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Old shadowy forests, in tumultuous dance;"
1810,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Or in the little measuring-worm advance,"
1811,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Inch by slow inch, along the swaying stem"
1812,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of some exalted flower; or lift the hem
1813,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of the frail butterfly’s embroidered cloak
1814,THE DIVINE FANTASY,In gentle breathings that the sun did stroke
1815,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Caressingly with fingers of his heat;
1816,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Or from the dog yearn upward, and entreat"
1817,THE DIVINE FANTASY,With eyes of adoration or of fear
1818,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"The great god, Man--“What message, master dear,"
1819,THE DIVINE FANTASY,From the dim heights beyond me where you are?”
1820,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"In the mare’s tremulous whinny, in the far"
1821,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Lowing of cattle from the upland sward,"
1822,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Or wail of whip-poor-wills, at twilight poured"

1827,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of Life, the dreadful, the magnificent."
1828,THE DIVINE FANTASY,
1829,THE DIVINE FANTASY,All afternoon the passion of heaven spent
1830,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"On earth its fiery fury in blind, bright"
1831,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Lightnings of dread and laughters of delight
1832,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Down shuddering deeps of shaken thunder, where"
1833,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The delirious longing loosed its sorrowing hair
1834,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of wind and shower and overshadowing cloud
1835,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Across the belovèd face, in darkness bowed"
1836,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Or glimmering light revealed; and cried aloud
1837,THE DIVINE FANTASY,For anger of utter ecstasy; and shed
1838,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The wild love of the rushing rain that sped
1839,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"To the thrilled heart, consenting, of the dim"
1840,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And rapturous earth, that lifted up to him"
1841,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Drowsed lips of thirsty flowers; and the cup
1842,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of every flower for joy was lifted up,"
1843,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And drank, and swayed! So, wearied out at length,"
1844,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Flagged the bright pulses, and the ebbing strength,"
1845,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"With muttering of remembered thunders, passed"
1846,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Down the large shores of evening: till at last
1847,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The exhausted heaven of twilight from afar
1848,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Shone washed of all her sorrows; and a star
1849,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Brooded above the fading storm, and saw"
1850,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The winnowed reaches deepening into awe
1851,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of gradual darkness, and the fields that lay"
1852,THE DIVINE FANTASY,All drenched and wearied out at dusk of day
1853,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And the worn end of things; while far away
1854,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The receding fury moaned.
1855,THE DIVINE FANTASY,
1856,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And now they lie
1857,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"In the same peace around me, and the sky"
1858,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Holds up her stars; now in the rain-drenched wood
1859,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"The tree-toad drinks the rain and finds it good,"
1860,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And trills for joy--the sliding waters grieve
1861,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Quietly--now the bat begins to weave
1862,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"With intricate motion on the cloudy loom,"
1863,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of glamourous starlight mingled and gray gloom,"
1864,THE DIVINE FANTASY,His dipping flight among the darkened boughs
1865,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And dreamy vistas; and the little mouse
1866,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Furtively hurries through the lane, his eye"
1867,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Turned up in terror as the owl goes by:
1868,THE DIVINE FANTASY,On softest feathers of silence overhead
1869,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Flits the dim shadow of the ancient dread,"
1870,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Hooded and vague, the cruelty of his beak"
1871,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Bent on old lustful mysteries.--A squeak--
1872,THE DIVINE FANTASY,A scuffle--beating of wings--and in the lane
1873,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Silence--and the old wrong is done again,"
1874,THE DIVINE FANTASY,That was ere Adam; the triumphant heart
1875,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And the defeated, each one doomed to his part,"
1876,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"They play it through, the old tragedy where one"
1877,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Presence still wars and still is warred upon,"
1878,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Slays and is slain: while fiercely all around
1879,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Shakes the eternal love-song in shrill sound,"
1880,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of grasshopper and cricket--sleepless flow
1881,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The immortal tides of longing to and fro
1882,THE DIVINE FANTASY,On waves of music; endless is the prayer
1883,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of life to the belovèd, everywhere"
1884,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Lifted in adoration: on dark shores
1885,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Beats the insistent passion that implores
1886,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"The one dear breast of pity or disdain,"
1887,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"To be reborn, to be reborn again--"
1888,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Nor perish wholly! The blind earth is thrilled
1889,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"As with vague rites accomplished, dreams fulfilled,"
1890,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Marriage and mystic union; all along
1891,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Her brimming meadows rings the bridal song
1892,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And chaunt ecstatic: that great heart of hers
1893,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Is touched now the eternal longing stirs
1894,THE DIVINE FANTASY,From hill to hollow and hollow to clear hill
1895,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"In many voices mingled, or the still"
1896,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Ecstasy of the firefly that trails
1897,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Among the shadows where the starlight fails,"
1898,THE DIVINE FANTASY,His body’s burning love. Forever flows
1899,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The dreadful drama to its stately close
1900,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And endless ending--the fierce carnival
1901,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of death and passion, wherein each and all"
1902,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Mix, and are mingled, slaughter, blend, and pass"
1903,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Each into other--the high poem that has
1904,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"No end and no beginning, that the one"
1905,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Self in all living forms beneath the sun,"
1906,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And on all worlds around him and above,"
1907,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Weaves on the strands of hunger, death, and love."
1908,THE DIVINE FANTASY,
1909,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"I see it all, I hear it all, and lie"
1910,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Under my swaying poplars, and the sky"
1911,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Is fretted with frail leaves. The mortal dream
1912,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Is in my heart: I hear the night-hawk’s scream
1913,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Shatter the silver silences, I hear"
1914,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The owl’s clear tremolo rise over-clear--
1915,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The mouse’s blood along his veins has made
1916,THE DIVINE FANTASY,His love-note lovelier and the night afraid
1917,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of beauty’s dreadful secret--and I know
1918,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Soft shapes of stealth that in the darkness go,"
1919,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Of furry lusts and gnawing hungers, small"
1920,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Twittering things obscene, that flit or crawl"
1921,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"In furtive secrecy, vague mouths and blurred"
1922,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of the night creature or nocturnal bird--
1923,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Amorphous moth and bat-wing--and the earth,"
1924,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"With all her burrows, nooks and nests of birth"
1925,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Crowded, and wreck of many a perished might,"
1926,THE DIVINE FANTASY,By the ebbed waters of Life’s fierce delight
1927,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Washed up on shores of silence--spoiled and spurned
1928,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Altars where once the sacred fire burned--
1929,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Forms flowing back into the Formlessness;
1930,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"In a supreme embrace, a long caress,"
1931,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Mixing their bodies with the mother mould--
1932,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And all the heaven of stars around me rolled,"
1933,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Whose brooding eyes have stared so many an age
1934,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Upon this theatre of lust and rage,"
1935,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of death and adoration. And a breeze
1936,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Rustles the branches of the poplar-trees.
1937,THE DIVINE FANTASY,
1938,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Dear Spark, that shinest in the solitude!"
1939,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"One Consciousness, that in the brotherhood"
1940,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of all earth’s living creatures movest on
1941,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The shaken ramparts of Oblivion--
1942,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Whose starry cry, across the darkness hurled,"
1943,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Makes music in the silence of the world!
1944,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Life, whose sole splendor in red slaughter spills"
1945,THE DIVINE FANTASY,The blood of its own breast; in many wills
1946,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Wars on the one Will; and in wrath or dread
1947,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Feeds on itself and, on itself being fed,"
1948,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Shines forth in song and color; gilds the dress
1949,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of the green-fly; and pours its loveliness
1950,THE DIVINE FANTASY,In rapture on the earth; in theatres
1951,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Of crowded congregation sits--nor stirs--
1952,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Watching itself, itself the spectacle;"
1953,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"And builds the swallow’s breast, and shapes the shell"
1954,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And all these mansions of its thought that are
1955,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Between the morning and the evening-star,"
1956,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"On earth, in heaven, or in the glimmering caves"
1957,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And grottoes of the world below the waves--
1958,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Butchers the ox, and, gladdened by his meat,"
1959,THE DIVINE FANTASY,In the young mother’s downward smile is sweet;
1960,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Or, sated on his body, walks abroad"
1961,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"In symphonies, and poems, and prayers to God;"
1962,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Sins, and has conscience and, repenting, sins;"
1963,THE DIVINE FANTASY,And in the lowly patient spider spins
1964,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Its fragile web; and in these words of mine
1965,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Flings out its groping utterance, line by line,"
1966,THE DIVINE FANTASY,Across the intangible abyss of thought--
1967,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"With infinite passion, infinite patience wrought--"
1968,THE DIVINE FANTASY,"Dread Loveliness! Be strong in me, be strong,"
1969,THE DIVINE FANTASY,To utter forth your meaning in my song!
