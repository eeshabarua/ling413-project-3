338,AWAY,"“I won’t be long,” the Little Boy said,"
339,AWAY,"As he clattered him down the stair,"
340,AWAY,And found him a hat for his curly head
341,AWAY,And called to a dog somewhere.
342,AWAY,Then off like a flash down the shady lane
343,AWAY,With a whistle and cry and song;
344,AWAY,And back to us ever it came again:
345,AWAY,“I won’t be gone very long.”
346,AWAY,
347,AWAY,"“I won’t be long,” the Little Boy said,"
348,AWAY,"As we saw him among the trees,"
349,AWAY,"His eyes all bright and his cheeks all red,"
350,AWAY,A friend of the birds and bees;
351,AWAY,"Then through the hedges and out of the gate,"
352,AWAY,For naught in the world goes wrong
353,AWAY,With a boy of six or seven or eight--
354,AWAY,“I won’t be gone very long.”
355,AWAY,
356,AWAY,"“I won’t be long,” the Little Boy said,"
357,AWAY,“I’m just going out to play.”
358,AWAY,And the curly dog barked and the two of them sped
359,AWAY,Over the clover away.
360,AWAY,He waved us a kiss with a little brown hand
361,AWAY,"And cries rose from here and there,"
362,AWAY,"For oh, but a boy does understand"
363,AWAY,A dog and the open air!
364,AWAY,
365,AWAY,"“I won’t be long,” the Little Boy said,"
366,AWAY,"“Don’t wait any supper--you see,"
367,AWAY,I’ll just have a bowl of milk and bread
368,AWAY,And my dog he will eat with me.”
369,AWAY,Then he swung his hat on its tangled string
370,AWAY,Till the curly dog wagged his tail
371,AWAY,And romped and played like a boy in spring
372,AWAY,And barked him a comrade’s hail.
373,AWAY,
374,AWAY,"“I won’t be long,” the Little Boy said--"
375,AWAY,"Oh, Mother of him, don’t cry!"
376,AWAY,"The leaves come green again, yellow and red,"
377,AWAY,And the years and the years go by.
378,AWAY,"But sometime he’ll come, as we’ve seen him do,"
379,AWAY,"With the bark of a dog and a song,"
380,AWAY,"For it must be true--oh, it must be true"
381,AWAY,That he’ll not be gone very long!

388,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,
389,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"Sometimes I wonder why they smile so pleasantly at me,"
390,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And pat my head when they pass by as friendly as can be;
391,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"Sometimes I wonder why they stop to tell me How-d’-do,"
392,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And ask me then how old I am and where I’m going to;
393,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And ask me can I spare a curl and say they used to know
394,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"A little girl that looked like me, oh, years and years ago;"
395,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"And I told Mamma how they smiled and asked her why they do,"
396,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,So she said if you smile at folks they always smile at you.
397,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,
398,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"I never knew I smiled at them when they were going by,"
399,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,I guess it smiled all by itself and that’s the reason why;
400,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,I just look up from playing if it’s any one I know
401,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And they most always smile at me and maybe say Hello;
402,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"And I can smile at any one, no matter who or where,"
403,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,Because I’m just a little girl with lots of them to spare;
404,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"And Mamma said we ought to smile at folks, and if you do"
405,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,Most always they feel better and they smile right back at you.
406,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,
407,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And when so many smile at me and ask me for a curl
408,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,It makes me think most everybody likes a little girl;
409,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And once when I was playing and a man was going by
410,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"He smiled at me and then he rubbed some dust out of his eye,"
411,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,"Because it made it water so, and said he used to know"
412,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,A little girl up in his yard who used to smile just so;
413,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And then I asked why don’t she now and then he said “You see--”
414,THE RECIPROCITY OF SMILES,And then he rubbed his eye again and only smiled at me.

476,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,
477,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,
478,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The Adams’s children, they just romp and play"
479,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And fall out of trees in the carelessest way,"
480,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And might break their legs from the way that they fall,"
481,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"But they get up laughing and not hurt at all,"
482,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"’Cause boys’ bones are soft, so their grandfather said;"
483,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And John Quincy Adams, he stands on his head"
484,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And drinks from a dipper, and all over town"
485,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,The boys will tell you how he drinks upside down.
486,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,
487,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The Adams’s children, they make enough noise"
488,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"In the yard where they live for three times as much boys,"
489,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,And sometimes they laugh and you hear it as clear
490,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,As can be up to Tinker’s and way over here;
491,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,And they’ve got a dog which is almost the same
492,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"As the rest of the boys and will play every game,"
493,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And bark all the time, and he makes so much noise"
494,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,He’s just like the rest of the Adams’s boys.
495,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,
496,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The Adams’s children, they go out to ride"
497,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"On a pony of theirs, with them all three astride,"
498,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,And the boy up in front makes him kick up and then
499,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The boy way behind, he gets thrown off again;"
500,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And the Adams’s pony, he looks just as though"
501,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,He’s trying to laugh when the others laugh so;
502,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"It looks like a laugh, but he can’t make a noise"
503,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,Like the dog or the rest of the Adams’s boys.
504,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,
505,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The Adams’s children, they go out to play"
506,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And sometimes their mother don’t see them all day,"
507,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"But she never frets, ’cause the world is too small,"
508,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"So she said, for three boys to get lost in it all."
509,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,And sometimes she listens outdoors and she hears
510,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The laughing and barking way over to Geer’s,"
511,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"Which is most half a mile, and she smiles, because then"
512,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,She knows they’ll be home when they’re hungry again.
513,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,
514,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"The Adams’s children, they get on as though"
515,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"They were three great chums and not brothers, you know;"
516,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And folks like to hear them, when they’re going past,"
517,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,With the big one ahead and the little one last.
518,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"They’ve always got playmates of their very own,"
519,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,"And don’t have to do chores or to study alone,"
520,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,And everything seems to be three times the fun
521,THE ADAMS’S BOYS,For the Adams’s children as though there’s just one!

530,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
531,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Billy Peeble, he ain’t got no parents--never had none, ’cause"
532,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,When he’s borned he was an orfunt; an’ he said ’at Santa Claus
533,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Never didn’t leave him nothin’, ’cause he was a county charge,"
534,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,An’ the overseer told him that his fambly was too large
535,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,To remember orfunt children; so I ast Ma couldn’t we
536,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Have Bill Peeble up to our house, so’s to see our Christmas tree."
537,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ she ast me if he’s dirty; an’ I said I guessed he was,"
538,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,But I didn’t think it makes no difference with Santa Claus.
539,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
540,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"My his clo’es was awful ragged! Ma, she put him in a tub"
541,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ she poured it full of water, an’ she gave him such a scrub"
542,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’At he ’ist set there an’ shivered; an’ he told me afterwurds
543,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’At he never washed all over out to Overseer Bird’s!
544,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’En she burned his ragged trousies an’ she gave him some of mine;
545,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"My! she rubbed him an’ she scrubbed him till she almost made him shine,"
546,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Nen he ’ist looked all around him like he’s scairt for quite a w’ile,"
547,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,An’ even w’en Ma’d pat his head he wouldn’t hardly smile.
548,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
549,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’En after w’ile Ma took some flour-sacks an’ ’en she laid
550,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"’Em right down at the fireplace, ’ist ’cause she is afraid"
551,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Santa Claus ’ll soil the carpet when he comes down there, you know;"
552,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ Billy Peeble watched her, an’ his eyes stuck out--’ist so!"
553,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’En Ma said ’at in the mornin’ if we’d look down on the sacks
554,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’At they’d be ’ist full of soot where Santa Claus had made his tracks;
555,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Billy Peeble stood there, lookin’! An’ he told me afterwurds"
556,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,He was scairt he’d wake right up an’ be at Overseer Bird’s.
557,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
558,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Well, ’en she hung our stockin’s up an’ after w’ile she said:"
559,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"“Now, you an’ Billy Peeble better go right off to bed,"
560,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ if you hear a noise tonight, don’t you boys make a sound,"
561,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’Cause Santa Claus don’t never come with little boys around!”
562,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"So me an’ Billy went to bed, an’ Billy Peeble, he"
563,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,Could hardly go to sleep at all--’ist tossed an’ tossed. You see
564,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,We had such w’ite sheets on the bed an’ he said afterwurds
565,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,They never had no sheets at all at Overseer Bird’s.
566,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
567,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,So we ’ist laid an’ talked an’ talked. An’ Billy ast me who
568,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Was Santa Claus. An’ I said I don’t know if it’s all true,"
569,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,But people say he’s some old man who ’ist loves little boys
570,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,An’ keeps a store at the north pole with heaps an’ heaps of toys
571,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"W’ich he brings down in a big sleigh, with reindeers for his steeds,"
572,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,An’ comes right down the chimbly flue an’ leaves ’ist what you needs.
573,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,My! he’s excited w’en I told him that! An’ afterwurds
574,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,He said they never had no toys at Overseer Bird’s.
575,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
576,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,I’m fallin’ pretty near asleep w’en Billy Peeble said:
577,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,“Sh-sh! What’s that noise?” An’ w’en he spoke I set right up in bed
578,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Till sure enough I heard it in the parlor down below,"
579,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ Billy Peeble, he set up an’ ’en he said: “Le’s go!”"
580,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"So we got up an’ sneaked down stairs, an’ both of us could see"
581,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"’At it was surely Santa Claus, ’ist like Ma said he’d be;"
582,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"But he must heard us comin’ down, because he stopped an’ said:"
583,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"“You, Henry Blake an’ William Peeble, go right back to bed!”"
584,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
585,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"My goodness, we was awful scairt! An’ both of us was pale,"
586,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,An’ Billy Peeble said up stairs: “My! Ain’t he ’ist a whale!”
587,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,We didn’t hardly dare to talk and got back into bed
588,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ Billy pulled the counterpane clear up above his head,"
589,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ in the mornin’ w’en we looked down on the flour-sacks,"
590,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"W’y sure enough we saw the soot where he had made his tracks,"
591,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ Billy got a suit of clothes, a drum, an’ sled an’ books,"
592,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Till he ’ist never said a word, but my! how glad he looks!"
593,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
594,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’En after w’ile it’s dinner time an’ Billy Peeble set
595,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Right next to Pa, an’ my! how he ’ist et an’ et an’ et!"
596,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,Till he ’ist puffed an’ had to leave his second piece of pie
597,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
598,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,[Illustration: BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS]
599,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
600,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Because he couldn’t eat no more. An’ after dinner, w’y,"
601,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Ma dressed him up in his new clo’es, an Billy Peeble said"
602,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"He’s sorry he’s an orfunt, an’ Ma patted Billy’s head,"
603,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"W’ich made him cry a little bit, an’ he said afterwurds"
604,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,Nobody ever pats his head at Overseer Bird’s.
605,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,
606,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"An’ all day long Pa looked at Ma an’ Ma she looked at him,"
607,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"Because, Pa said ’at Billy looked a little bit like Jim"
608,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"’At was my baby brother, but he died oncet, years ago,"
609,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,An’ ’at’s w’y Billy Peeble makes my mother like him so.
610,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,"She says ’at Santa brought him as a present, ’ist instead"
611,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,Of little Jim ’at died oncet. So she ’ist put him to bed
612,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,On Christmas night an’ tucked him in an’ told me afterwurds
613,BILLY PEEBLE’S CHRISTMAS,’At he ain’t never goin’ back to Overseer Bird’s.

626,THE WAY HE USED TO DO,I knew that stealthy step was you.”

630,THE WAY HE USED TO DO,Sometimes when I come home at six
631,THE WAY HE USED TO DO,"O’clock and hurry up my chores,"

633,THE WAY HE USED TO DO,"Of wood and bring it all indoors,"
634,THE WAY HE USED TO DO,My Pop he comes and feels my head
635,THE WAY HE USED TO DO,And says: “You’ve been in swimmin’--you!”

1190,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,I never speak a word to let her know

1194,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"And hears me say: “Please, Sally Jane, take these,”"
1195,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,It is no wonder that she understands.
1196,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,
1197,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,Or when she sees me at the old front gate
1198,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"With my new sled right after the first snow,"
1199,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,And from her window calls to me to wait
1200,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"Until she asks her Mother can she go,"

1202,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"In my fur cap with mittens on my hands,"

1204,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,She looks at me and then she understands.
1205,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,
1206,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"Or if she whispers something when in school,"
1207,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"As children are quite often apt to do,"
1208,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"Forgetting all about the teacher’s rule,"
1209,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,And teacher says to Sally: “Was that you?”
1210,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,Why then I see how scared she is and rise
1211,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,Up in my seat and hold up both my hands
1212,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,And take the blame--she looks into my eyes eyes--
1213,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,I do not need to speak--she understands.
1214,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,
1215,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,Or if she has the measles so I dare
1216,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"Not go up to her house, but I can look"
1217,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"In through the window and she sees me there,"
1218,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,And if I bring a dandy story book
1219,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,And leave it on the fence post where the nurse
1220,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"Can come and take it in, and if my hands"
1221,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"Have written, “Dear, I hope you’ll be no worse,”"
1222,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,I do not need to speak--she understands.
1223,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,
1224,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,I do not need to tell her how I feel--
1225,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,She only has to watch the things I do;
1226,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"She knows my heart is true to her as steel,"
1227,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,And if it rains or if the sky is blue
1228,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"I wait for her to walk to school with me,"
1229,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"And carry all her school-books in my hands,"
1230,A LITTLE LOVE STORY,"And I am just as happy as can be,"

1266,ON A NOISELESS FOURTH,The lips of the village speaker moved in the tongueless strains of
1267,ON A NOISELESS FOURTH,a wordless speech.

1412,THE LAND OF BLOW BUBBLES,"His heart is as pure as a snowflake in air,"
1413,THE LAND OF BLOW BUBBLES,A fig for the whole of his troubles!
1414,THE LAND OF BLOW BUBBLES,"For he’s my Boy Careless--you’ve seen him somewhere,"

1418,THE LAND OF BLOW BUBBLES,"Through the lanes and across the sere stubbles,"

1420,THE LAND OF BLOW BUBBLES,In that magic boy land of Blow Bubbles!
1421,THE LAND OF BLOW BUBBLES,"He bears at his side a sword cut from a lath,"

1460,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"Till a great rolling pin was run over him, so!"
1461,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"To flatten him out, and he lay there so thin,"
1462,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,His bones almost popped through the holes in his skin;
1463,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"They sifted him over with flour and spice,"
1464,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"And made him some eyes with two kernels of rice,"
1465,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"And took some dried currants, the biggest and best,"
1466,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,To make him some buttons for closing his vest.
1467,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,
1468,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"The Gingercake man wabbled this way and that,"
1469,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,When they seeded a raisin and made him a hat
1470,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"That was stuck on his head in the jauntiest way,"
1471,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,For a Gingercake man is not made every day.
1472,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"They stuck in some cloves for his ears; yes, indeed!"
1473,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"And made him some teeth out of caraway seed,"
1474,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,And when he was finished they buttered a pan--
1475,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,The biggest they had--for the Gingercake man.
1476,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,
1477,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,Then into the oven they put him to bake
1478,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,Until he was hard and could stand and not break
1479,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,His legs when he stood; and they set him to cool
1480,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,Until all the children should come home from school.
1481,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"And oh, the delight and the wonder and glee,"
1482,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"When mother invited the children to see,"

1485,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,
1486,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"All sifted with sugar and out of the pan,"
1487,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,The good-natured face of the Gingercake man.
1488,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,
1489,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,But alas and alas! ’Tis a short life and sweet
1490,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"Is the Gingercake man’s--for they ate off his feet,"
1491,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"They broke off his arms with the hungriest zest,"
1492,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,And picked all the buttons from out of his vest;
1493,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"They nibbled his legs off and ate up his hat,"
1494,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,"And everything edible went just like that,"
1495,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,Till the cloves and the kernels of rice you may scan
1496,THE GINGERCAKE MAN,As all that is left of the Gingercake man!

1947,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,
1948,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,
1949,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,This is the story of Mortimer Brown
1950,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Who went for his mother some errands in town,"
1951,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Who was told he must come back as quick as he could
1952,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And as earnestly promised his mother he would.
1953,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,He went down the front steps full three at a time
1954,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"And swung on the gate, for the swinging was prime."
1955,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,
1956,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,He teetered on all the loose boards in the walk
1957,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And met Jimmy Brady and sat down to talk;
1958,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,He climbed up the trunk of a big tree that stands
1959,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Not so far from his home, and he swung with both hands."
1960,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"He passed the cow pasture and stopped for a stroll,"
1961,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Climbed the fence and turned twice on the very top pole.
1962,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,
1963,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Then he turned a few handsprings all through the long grass
1964,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And sat on the fence to watch Peter Bates pass
1965,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"With a big flock of sheep, and he got himself chased"
1966,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,By the biggest black ram and he fell in his haste
1967,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Down the bank of the brook and he sat there about
1968,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Half an hour in the sun till his clothes were dried out.
1969,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,He laid off his coat since the day was so hot
1970,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And chose a bypath through the strawberry plot;
1971,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,He gathered some berries to eat on his way
1972,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Till alarmed by the watch-dog’s deep, ominous bay."
1973,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Then he followed a rabbit as far as he could
1974,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Until it was lost in the depth of a wood,"
1975,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And marked a bee tree so to find it again
1976,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,When he and Jim Brady should visit Beech Glen.
1977,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,So tired then he was that he sat down to rest
1978,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And he fell sound asleep with his coat and his vest
1979,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,
1980,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Spread under his head, when the rumble of wheels"
1981,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,On the road waked him up and he saw Elmer Beals
1982,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Driving by in the lane and he climbed up beside
1983,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"On a big load of squashes and had a fine ride,"
1984,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And helped lead the horses to water as soon
1985,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,As they both reached the town in the late afternoon.
1986,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"And then, oh, alas! The long list Mother wrote"
1987,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Of the things he should get had dropped out of his coat,"
1988,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,
1989,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,So he bought some stick candy and cookies--he knew
1990,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,"Of the things she would need they must surely be two,"
1991,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,And munching them sadly the whole of the way
1992,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,Back homeward he wondered what Mother would say.
1993,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,I wonder if ever in country or town
1994,THE TRAVELS OF MORTIMER BROWN,You have known such a lad as this Mortimer Brown?

2015,ADVENTURERS THREE,"I know he used to see them, for I’ve seen him creep and crawl,"

2029,ADVENTURERS THREE,"Sometimes he gets a wetting when the seas are very high,"
2030,ADVENTURERS THREE,"And has to have his sailor clothes hung on the line to dry,"
2031,ADVENTURERS THREE,"So he becomes a soldier and upon a march he goes,"
2032,ADVENTURERS THREE,And what he is this moment quite depends upon his clothes.
2033,ADVENTURERS THREE,"He never shoots a lion when he wears a sailor suit,"
2034,ADVENTURERS THREE,"Or walks the deck in buckskins, which he only wears to shoot,"

2365,HENRY BLAKE’S CHUM,
2366,HENRY BLAKE’S CHUM,"Henry Blake’s chum, he came up from the farm,"

2369,HENRY BLAKE’S CHUM,Or what the equator was named.
2370,HENRY BLAKE’S CHUM,But when it came recess we all stood about
2371,HENRY BLAKE’S CHUM,"And waited until he would come,"

2425,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Five minutes chasing butterflies
2426,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"Way over, off the road;"
2427,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Five minutes watching Willie Price
2428,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Do tricks with his pet toad;
2429,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Five minutes helping Gibbsie get
2430,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,His pig back in the pen--
2431,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,I wonder if it’s school-time yet?
2432,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,I guess I’m late again.
2433,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,
2434,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,I think I lost a little time
2435,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Because I walked so slow
2436,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Where Johnny Watkins lost a dime
2437,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,A day or two ago.
2438,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"It’s underneath the leaves somewhere,"
2439,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,And Johnny feels so blue
2440,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,That I just stopped a minute there
2441,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Because he asked me to.
2442,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,
2443,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"And then it rained a little bit,"
2444,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,And Dominick McPhee
2445,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Had his straw hat and had to sit
2446,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"Under a good thick tree,"
2447,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Or else he’d get it spoiled and get
2448,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"The top all swelled. You see,"
2449,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,A straw hat is not safe to wet--
2450,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"His kind, especially."
2451,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,
2452,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,And after we had saved his hat
2453,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"From getting spoiled for him,"
2454,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,A big woodpecker came and sat
2455,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Upon a rotten limb;
2456,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"And Johnny said when they’re about,"
2457,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"Somebody told the boys,"
2458,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,You see a lot of worms come out
2459,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,To see what makes the noise.
2460,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,
2461,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,So then we boys all stayed about
2462,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"A couple minutes more,"
2463,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,In hopes to see the worms come out
2464,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Which he was rapping for;
2465,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,But after he went b-r-r-r! and b-r-r-r!
2466,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"A while, he flew away,"
2467,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,And Johnny said he guessed there were
2468,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,No worms at home that day.
2469,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,
2470,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"So then we hurried up, and ran"
2471,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,"As fast as we could run,"
2472,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,To get there just as school began.
2473,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,And just when it’s begun
2474,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,I had to run back to the tree
2475,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,To get my slate and rule;
2476,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,And yet the teacher cannot see
2477,THE WAY TO SCHOOL,Why boys are late for school.

2752,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,He’s got things up there for most all kinds of boys
2753,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,From ten years old clear down to two.
2754,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,And one day he gave me some books from up there
2755,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,Like boys had a long time ago;
2756,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"And I asked if the boy they belong to would care,"
2757,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,But he just sort of smiled and said no.
2758,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,
2759,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,Sometimes we would go in his attic to play
2760,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"And find such a lot of fine things,"
2761,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,A whole lot of picture books all piled away
2762,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,And tops that were wound up with strings.
2763,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,And Uncle Bill told us to use what was there
2764,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"Just as if it was ours, and we’d go,"

2776,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,
2777,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"And the boy they belong to, I guess, was away."
2778,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"At least, we all thought he must be;"
2779,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"For all through the house they could hear us at play,"
2780,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,But he never came up there to see.
2781,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,And we would pile everything back up with care
2782,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,And ask Uncle Bill when we’d go
2783,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,"If the boy they belong to would know we’d been there,"
2784,THE OWNERLESS TOYS,But he just sort of smiled and said no.

2857,IN VACATION TIME,Of a sun that I wish could be shining in mine.
2858,IN VACATION TIME,

2865,IN VACATION TIME,

2869,IN VACATION TIME,"With a nail through their tops, for a button won’t last;"
2870,IN VACATION TIME,But deep in his heart lies a spring cool and fine
2871,IN VACATION TIME,Of good cheer that I wish could be bubbling in mine.
2872,IN VACATION TIME,
2873,IN VACATION TIME,"There’s a tan on his cheek where the flush of health glows,"

2876,IN VACATION TIME,With jack-knives and other uncountable things;

2885,BEREAVED,
2886,BEREAVED,"Guess he must be awful old; we had him years and years,"
2887,BEREAVED,And he’s so old the ends were worn all off of both his ears.
2888,BEREAVED,"He couldn’t hardly eat, because his teeth were all worn out,"
2889,BEREAVED,"And all his legs got stiff, so he could hardly drag about."
2890,BEREAVED,"One day he lay down by the house, right near the cellar door,"
2891,BEREAVED,"And gasped and gasped for breath, until he couldn’t any more;"
2892,BEREAVED,"So I went out and patted him, and when he heard me call"
2893,BEREAVED,"He looked at me and wagged his tail, which died the last of all."
2894,BEREAVED,
2895,BEREAVED,"My! he was black and curly once, when he was new and young,"
2896,BEREAVED,"And he would open up his mouth at us and curl his tongue,"
2897,BEREAVED,"Just like he laughed, and play with us; and he would go into"
2898,BEREAVED,"The creek, and bring our hats to us, or anything we threw."
2899,BEREAVED,"In winter we would hitch him up, and he would haul our sled,"
2900,BEREAVED,"And walk or trot or run with it, or anything we said;"
2901,BEREAVED,So when he wagged his tail at me I laid him right beside
2902,BEREAVED,"The cellar door, and then I went behind the barn and cried."
2903,BEREAVED,
2904,BEREAVED,"He was a friend of all the boys, and when they came to play"
2905,BEREAVED,He’d wag his tail and bark and look at them the smartest way;
2906,BEREAVED,"And he’d pretend to bite at them and nip their pants, but he"
2907,BEREAVED,"Would never bite, ’cause he was just as kind as he could be."
2908,BEREAVED,"And Henry Watson looked at him beside the cellar door,"
2909,BEREAVED,"And said, “He’ll never haul us boys on our sled any more.”"
2910,BEREAVED,He turned his ears back straight and nice; he liked him awful well;
2911,BEREAVED,"Because he had tears in his eyes, and then a big one fell."
2912,BEREAVED,
2913,BEREAVED,"So after while we got a spade, and Billy Gibson came,"
2914,BEREAVED,"And Tommy Dean and Eddie Brink, and they all felt the same."
2915,BEREAVED,"We dug some turf up in the yard, right underneath a tree,"
2916,BEREAVED,"And laid him in and left him there, all covered carefully;"
2917,BEREAVED,"It was an awful solemn day for all of us, for though"
2918,BEREAVED,"He’d got worn out and couldn’t eat, we boys all liked him so;"
2919,BEREAVED,"And Eddie Brink, he didn’t think the Lord would really care"
2920,BEREAVED,If we boys sang a hymn for him and said a little prayer.
2921,BEREAVED,
2922,BEREAVED,My! it was awful sad that day! And Tommy said he thought
2923,BEREAVED,"We wouldn’t play that afternoon, because he’d rather not."
2924,BEREAVED,"And Mamma made some nice ice-cream, which cheered us up, but when"
2925,BEREAVED,We wanted her to eat she said she couldn’t eat just then.
2926,BEREAVED,"And Amy Robbins heard of it, and brought some leaves and flowers"
2927,BEREAVED,"To scatter over him, because he was a friend of ours;"
2928,BEREAVED,"And I told her I patted him, and when he heard me call"
2929,BEREAVED,"He looked at me and wagged his tail, which died the last of all."

3162,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,In far off Fredericktown;
3163,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,And I’ve seen Jackson lift his hat
3164,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"And bid his troops march on,"
3165,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"But now, alas! they tell me that"
3166,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"Is a dreamer’s tale, and gone!"
3167,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,
3168,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"And oft at night, as though ’t were real,"
3169,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"I’ve heard the flame’s wild roar,"
3170,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,I’ve seen Jim Bludso hold the wheel
3171,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,Till the last galoot’s ashore;
3172,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"I thought the better of men for it,"
3173,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"And of duty to die or do,"
3174,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"But some wise men, of little wit,"
3175,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,Say none of the tale is true.
3176,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,
3177,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"Oh, leave me the ride of Paul Revere"
3178,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,And the story of Fredericktown!
3179,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,The nozzle agin’ th’ bank--so clear
3180,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,From guileless boyhood down!
3181,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"Leave me the curfew that was not rung,"
3182,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,Leave them for me and you;
3183,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,"And let more songs like these be sung,"
3184,A PLEA FOR OLD FRIENDS,Though none of the tales be true!

3190,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3191,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3192,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,Hark! What is that clatter and patter of feet?
3193,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,The Boyville Cadets are half-way up the street!
3194,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"They march two by two, a most bloodthirsty horde,"
3195,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Led by Captain Tom Jones, with a big wooden sword."
3196,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"They’re mostly barelegged and coatless and brown,"
3197,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"A make-believe army from all parts of town,"
3198,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"With guns on their shoulders all whittled from lath,"
3199,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,And woe to the foeman who crosses their path.
3200,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3201,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,Bob Brown has a fife and Bill Blake has a drum.
3202,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,See now in what martial procession they come;
3203,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Jim Dobbs waves the flag with victorious flirt,"
3204,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,A long willow pole with a red woolen shirt.
3205,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"And Corporal Brownlegs, he squints down the line:"
3206,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"“Attention! Right shoulder! Guide right!” Oh, it’s fine"
3207,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"To know you’ve no troubles, no worries, no debts,"
3208,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,And march down the street with the Boyville Cadets!
3209,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3210,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Now Sergeant Big Freckles cries, “Hep! Hep!” and “Hep!”"
3211,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,To see that the army keeps right perfect step.
3212,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"And General Red Hair reins up with great force,"
3213,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,To shout some command from his make-believe horse.
3214,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Then Captain Tom Jones gives a formal salute,"
3215,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"And rests his big sword on the toe of his boot,"
3216,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,For woe to the foe that harasses or frets
3217,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,The solid platoon of the Boyville Cadets!
3218,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3219,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,Then Corporal Barefoot is ordered to scout
3220,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"For bloodthirsty redskins, and look all about."
3221,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"They march, single file, through the thick-growing trees,"
3222,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,For favorite haunts of the red men are these.
3223,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Far off in the woods, is an ear-splitting shout."
3224,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Alas! ’Tis the death-cry of Barefoot, the scout!"
3225,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,And now all the air rings with war-whoops and cries;
3226,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Bang! bang! go the laths, and the red savage dies!"
3227,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3228,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"A hand-to-hand fight, and the battle is done;"
3229,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"In the orchard the redskins lie dead, every one."
3230,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"But, oh, woe is me! For all gory and red"
3231,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Lies Barefoot, the scout, by the red men struck dead!"
3232,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,The Boyville Cadets lift him out of the dirt;
3233,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,They wrap him about with the old woolen shirt;
3234,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"And then, with drums muffled and heads sadly bowed,"
3235,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"They bear him back home, with the flag for a shroud."
3236,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,
3237,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Then General Red Hair, in orders, gives thanks"
3238,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"To all of his soldiers, and bids them break ranks."
3239,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,For out of the distance he hears a shrill call:
3240,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"“Tom! Joe! Bill! Jim! Children! Why, where are you all?”"
3241,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,"Then Barefoot, the scout, to his life is restored,"
3242,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,And Captain Tom Jones hides his big wooden sword;
3243,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,For there’s wood to be split and there’s water to get
3244,THE BOYVILLE CADETS,In the dull private life of the Boyville Cadet.

3251,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,
3252,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"A little boy I used to know, from whom I’ve been away,"
3253,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"Oh, very many years, took me upon a trip today."
3254,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"It seemed so ood to be with him, and he was glad to be"
3255,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"Companion, guide, and friend until the journey’s end with me."
3256,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"I quite forgot my cares with him, nor could I well be sad,"
3257,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"As long as he was at my side, for he was blithe and glad,"
3258,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"And oh, the merry songs he sang, the tunes he whistled clear"
3259,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,That I had half forgotten till he sang and whistled here!
3260,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,
3261,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"By many a winding stream we went, and many a limpid brook,"
3262,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Where oft he bade me stop and cast a line and fishing hook
3263,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"Until we drew a struggling fish from out some eddy deep,"
3264,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,And once upon the bank we lay and both fell fast asleep.
3265,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"By clover meadows sweet we strayed, where cow bells tinkled far,"
3266,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"Deep in the woods where hollow logs and darting squirrels are,"
3267,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,And here and there he bade me stop till he would climb a tree
3268,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,To shake a limb and rattle down some nuts for him and me.
3269,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,
3270,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"Down many a shady lane we walked, through some familiar land,"
3271,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Where dreams of faces long forgot arose on every hand;
3272,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"We saw a cottage by the road, and in the kitchen door"
3273,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,A woman with the sweetest face--a glimpse and nothing more.
3274,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,And as she vanished from our sight I saw the teardrops shine
3275,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"In both his eyes, and I could feel the tears well up in mine;"
3276,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,He plucked his shabby sleeve to brush the teardrops from his eye
3277,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"And whispered, “I saw Mother there!” and I said, “So did I!”"
3278,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,
3279,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,And there were spreading apple trees where oft he bade me lie
3280,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Upon the grass and watch the clouds that swept across the sky.
3281,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"He lent me many a dream to dream--of fame and love and truth,"
3282,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Such dreams as Fancy stores within the Treasureheart of Youth!
3283,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Ofttimes we found a sparkling spring and lay upon the brink
3284,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"Our lips laved with its bubbling stream, to drink and drink and drink;"
3285,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"And oh, the joys we two renewed, and oh, the hum of bees,"
3286,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"The songs of birds, the violets and treasures such as these!"
3287,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,
3288,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"A little boy I used to know, a lad of nine or ten,"
3289,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Took me a journey glad today--I hope he’ll come again
3290,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"To take my hand and walk with me where golden sunshine gleams,"
3291,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,To lead me by familiar ways and lend me all his dreams!
3292,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,"To keep me near the hopes we had, to whistle merry tunes,"
3293,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,To find me dawns like those we knew and sunny afternoons;
3294,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,A little boy his Mother loved!--a lad of nine or ten;
3295,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,Perhaps you’ve known and walked with him--I hope he comes again!
3296,A LITTLE BOY I KNOW,

3332,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,The side-splitting clown laughter blended
3333,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,"With soul-stirring airs by the band,"
3334,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,Till naught of the glad marvel lingers
3335,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,"Save what in his dreams he may keep,"
3336,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,As he clasps his balloon with close fingers
3337,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,"And rests in my arms, fast asleep."
3338,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,
3339,ASLEEP AT THE CIRCUS,"And so from these joys without number,"

3364,THE BARRIERS,
3365,THE BARRIERS,"Sun and the Wind and the freshness of showers,"
3366,THE BARRIERS,How could you tempt him to revel and roam
3367,THE BARRIERS,Past the long hedges and through the wild flowers?
3368,THE BARRIERS,Did you not know it would cost him a home?
3369,THE BARRIERS,Did you not know when the gay bluebird glistened
3370,THE BARRIERS,"Up on the bough and with wonder he rose,"
3371,THE BARRIERS,"Rose with his heart beating glad, as he listened,"

3374,THE BARRIERS,"Hide your heads, Daisies, that wave over yonder,"
3375,THE BARRIERS,"Gleam in the sunlight and dance by the creek,"

3378,THE BARRIERS,"You, too, the larks through the green meadows winging,"
3379,THE BARRIERS,Did you not tempt him with glad song and free?
3380,THE BARRIERS,Why did you not let him learn through your singing
3381,THE BARRIERS,He would be outcast through following thee?
3382,THE BARRIERS,
3383,THE BARRIERS,"Heartless blackberries, you led him from shelter;"
3384,THE BARRIERS,"Nuts, without shame, you did bid him to climb;"
3385,THE BARRIERS,"Butterflies bright, that he chased helter-skelter,"
3386,THE BARRIERS,Have you no shame for the depths of your crime?
3387,THE BARRIERS,"What if the heart of him beats but the truer,"
3388,THE BARRIERS,"What if the soul of him still sweeter grows,"
3389,THE BARRIERS,"What if the eyes of him sparkle the truer,"
3390,THE BARRIERS,Do you not see you have freckled his nose?
3391,THE BARRIERS,
3392,THE BARRIERS,"Scrub out the freckles--oh, well, doesn’t matter;"

3395,THE BARRIERS,Rise to offend supersensitive ears;

3513,THE LOSER,"To be a hero nevermore, unsung, unwept, unknown."
3514,THE LOSER,
3515,THE LOSER,’Twas only yesterday he was the idol of the team!
3516,THE LOSER,Those cheers and loud hurrahs he heard--could they have been a dream?
3517,THE LOSER,They called him Tim the Tiger then! Small boys by scores he saw
3518,THE LOSER,"To bear his glove, his coat, his shoes, with gratitude and awe."
3519,THE LOSER,With joy they saw his arm laid bare--that mighty arm and brown
3520,THE LOSER,That wound itself about his head and mowed the batsmen down;
3521,THE LOSER,"And when he went upon the field, the mighty cheer for him"
3522,THE LOSER,Showed how their hopes of victory were all bound up in Tim!
3523,THE LOSER,
3524,THE LOSER,"It was but yesterday he bore the laurels on his brow,"
3525,THE LOSER,"But who, alas! is there so low to do him honor now?"
3526,THE LOSER,"His heart swells, bursting in his chest; the heart so bruised and sore;"
3527,THE LOSER,Could he but go back on the field and pitch that game once more!
3528,THE LOSER,"The tears fall from his eyes like rain, the hot and angry tears,"
3529,THE LOSER,No sorrow has he known like this in all his fifteen years;
3530,THE LOSER,How will he meet the Tigers now? How look intothe eyes
3531,THE LOSER,Of those who staked their all on him and saw him lose the prize?
3532,THE LOSER,
3533,THE LOSER,"To school he walks secluded ways where once with pride he strode,"
3534,THE LOSER,"With awestruck youngsters all about, the middle of the road;"
3535,THE LOSER,Far from the madding crowd he stands upon the playground there
3536,THE LOSER,His honors fallen like the leaves in Autumn’s frosty air;
3537,THE LOSER,"A humble Tiger is he now, and small boys pass him by"
3538,THE LOSER,With cruel sneers where once he heard the cheers ring shrill and high;
3539,THE LOSER,"And Reddy Blake, the Cyclone Curve, is pitcher forthe team,"
3540,THE LOSER,While he’s but the somnambulist of a quick-vanished dream!

3548,BACK TO SCHOOL,Fell in the creek twice yesterday!
3549,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Slipped and slid from a load of hay,"
3550,BACK TO SCHOOL,Stepped on a stone and bruised my toe;
3551,BACK TO SCHOOL,Hardly walk ’cause I’m blistered so;
3552,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Hit my knee till it’s blue and black,"
3553,BACK TO SCHOOL,Sat in the sun and burned my back
3554,BACK TO SCHOOL,"When I went to swim, but my, I’m glad!"
3555,BACK TO SCHOOL,Best vacation I ever had.
3556,BACK TO SCHOOL,
3557,BACK TO SCHOOL,Slid off the old red barn last week.
3558,BACK TO SCHOOL,Wind all gone so I couldn’t speak
3559,BACK TO SCHOOL,When they laid me in upon the bed
3560,BACK TO SCHOOL,And put cold water on my head.
3561,BACK TO SCHOOL,Got poison-ivy on my legs
3562,BACK TO SCHOOL,When I went in the weeds to look for eggs;
3563,BACK TO SCHOOL,But I’ve had more fun since I don’t know when!
3564,BACK TO SCHOOL,Hate to go back to school again.
3565,BACK TO SCHOOL,
3566,BACK TO SCHOOL,Burned my hands till they’re awful sore
3567,BACK TO SCHOOL,When the calf ran out of the big barn door
3568,BACK TO SCHOOL,And I tried to hold the rope and fell
3569,BACK TO SCHOOL,Most twenty feet down the old dry well.
3570,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Lost my hat that was almost new,"
3571,BACK TO SCHOOL,"In the great big lake, when the high wind blew;"
3572,BACK TO SCHOOL,"And my pants are torn from many a climb,"
3573,BACK TO SCHOOL,But I never had such a summer-time.
3574,BACK TO SCHOOL,
3575,BACK TO SCHOOL,Ate poison berries by the creek
3576,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Till they thought I’d die, I felt so sick;"
3577,BACK TO SCHOOL,"But they gave me ipecac to take,"
3578,BACK TO SCHOOL,And it cured up all my stomach-ache!
3579,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Got stung by bees, but I got stung best"
3580,BACK TO SCHOOL,"When I started home with a hornet’s nest,"
3581,BACK TO SCHOOL,"And I all swelled up; but I’m gone down now,"
3582,BACK TO SCHOOL,"And it’s all in a boy’s life, anyhow!"
3583,BACK TO SCHOOL,
3584,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Nose all peeled till it’s red and rough,"
3585,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Hands all brown, but I’m awful tough"
3586,BACK TO SCHOOL,"From the exercise, and I’m big and strong,"
3587,BACK TO SCHOOL,’Cause I hoed in a corn-field all day long.
3588,BACK TO SCHOOL,And my uncle said that I might stay
3589,BACK TO SCHOOL,"For harvest-time, and he’d give me pay;"
3590,BACK TO SCHOOL,"And I’d like to stay, but I have to go"
3591,BACK TO SCHOOL,"Back home to school, ’cause my Ma said so."

3610,DISENCHANTMENTS,"Warning us not till his warwhoop was sounded,"
3611,DISENCHANTMENTS,Leaving us scalped on the greensward about.
3612,DISENCHANTMENTS,"How things have changed from the steed and the stirrup,"

3619,DISENCHANTMENTS,Sighting some bloodthirsty savage who loitered
3620,DISENCHANTMENTS,Near by the scene of some scalp-lifting raid.
3621,DISENCHANTMENTS,"How things have changed since the red deer went leaping,"
3622,DISENCHANTMENTS,"Since came the bison by hundreds to browse,"

3629,DISENCHANTMENTS,Blood-chilling fears in their boldness of speech.
3630,DISENCHANTMENTS,"Bruce had a refuge here, Wallace lay wounded,"
3631,DISENCHANTMENTS,"Hallowed its clammy walls, safe its retreat,"
3632,DISENCHANTMENTS,"Once ’twas a labyrinth, gloomy, unsounded,"

3648,A RAINY NIGHT,
3649,A RAINY NIGHT,
3650,A RAINY NIGHT,’Bout eight o’clock first night that we
3651,A RAINY NIGHT,Were down at the academy
3652,A RAINY NIGHT,"’Twas awful rainy out, and so"
3653,A RAINY NIGHT,"We both of us stayed in, you know;"
3654,A RAINY NIGHT,But we could hear the wind and rain
3655,A RAINY NIGHT,Come splashing on the window-pane;
3656,A RAINY NIGHT,"And after while, why, Henry Stout"
3657,A RAINY NIGHT,"Put up the curtain and looked out,"
3658,A RAINY NIGHT,"And said, “My! Ain’t she coming down!"
3659,A RAINY NIGHT,I wish I was in Beaverstown.”
3660,A RAINY NIGHT,
3661,A RAINY NIGHT,"And then nobody spoke at all,"
3662,A RAINY NIGHT,Just listened to the rain-drops fall;
3663,A RAINY NIGHT,And Henry sniffled up his nose
3664,A RAINY NIGHT,"Because he had a cold, I s’pose."
3665,A RAINY NIGHT,"And then he said, “I wonder how"
3666,A RAINY NIGHT,Our folks are getting on by now.”
3667,A RAINY NIGHT,"And I said, “Oh, I guess all right."
3668,A RAINY NIGHT,My! Ain’t it rainy out to-night!”
3669,A RAINY NIGHT,And Henry gave a great big sigh
3670,A RAINY NIGHT,And swallowed hard--and so did I.
3671,A RAINY NIGHT,
3672,A RAINY NIGHT,"And then he said, “My! Such a noise!"
3673,A RAINY NIGHT,I guess there’s lots of homesick boys
3674,A RAINY NIGHT,"Around tonight.” And I said, “Oh,”--"
3675,A RAINY NIGHT,"Just careless like--“Oh, I don’t know.”"
3676,A RAINY NIGHT,"And then he said, “I guess Jim Brown"
3677,A RAINY NIGHT,Is glad he stayed in Beaverstown
3678,A RAINY NIGHT,And didn’t have to come down here.”
3679,A RAINY NIGHT,"And I said, “Do your eyes feel queer?"
3680,A RAINY NIGHT,"I got a speck in mine, I guess,"
3681,A RAINY NIGHT,"They water so.” And he said, “Yes.”"
3682,A RAINY NIGHT,
3683,A RAINY NIGHT,"And then he looked and tried to smile,"
3684,A RAINY NIGHT,"And we kept still for quite a while,"
3685,A RAINY NIGHT,"And heard it rain; and then he said,"
3686,A RAINY NIGHT,“I s’pose our folks are gone to bed
3687,A RAINY NIGHT,"And sound asleep by now, I guess.”"
3688,A RAINY NIGHT,"And then I swallowed and said, “Yes.”"
3689,A RAINY NIGHT,So then we both got into bed
3690,A RAINY NIGHT,"And heard it rain; and then he said,"
3691,A RAINY NIGHT,“My! Ain’t she just a-pouring down!
3692,A RAINY NIGHT,I wish I was in Beaverstown.”

3702,KITCHEN MIRACLES,A pumpkin from the garden--just a yellow sphere that lies
3703,KITCHEN MIRACLES,Beneath her skilful handling ripens quickly into pies;
3704,KITCHEN MIRACLES,"The corn grows into fritters, you must marvel at the change;"
3705,KITCHEN MIRACLES,The apples change to dumplings in the glowing kitchen range
3706,KITCHEN MIRACLES,"She waves her hands above it, and the milk is cottage cheese."

3708,KITCHEN MIRACLES,
3709,KITCHEN MIRACLES,"She finds it easy, quite, to make blueberries into rolls;"
3710,KITCHEN MIRACLES,And eggs are changed to omelets above the glowing coals;
3711,KITCHEN MIRACLES,And sometimes when she’s fixing the materials for pies
3712,KITCHEN MIRACLES,She turns cider into mince-meat right before your very eyes!
3713,KITCHEN MIRACLES,Sometimes she makes a currant roll--you would not think she could--
3714,KITCHEN MIRACLES,"Or makes a peach turn over, or does something just as good;"
3715,KITCHEN MIRACLES,But she says quite the hardest task that ever she has found

3725,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"And wonderful, wonderful muscles he had;"
3726,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,He swung by one arm from the limb of a tree
3727,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And hung there while Jim counted up forty-three
3728,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Just as slow as he could; and he leaped at a bound
3729,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Across a wide creek and lit square on the ground
3730,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"Just as light as a deer; and the things he can do,"
3731,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"So Jimmy told us, you would hardly think true."
3732,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,
3733,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Jim Brady’s big brother could throw a fly ball
3734,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,From center to home just like nothing at all;
3735,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And often while playing a game he would stand
3736,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And take a high fly with just only one hand;
3737,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Jim Brady showed us where he knocked a home run
3738,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And won the big game when it stood three to one
3739,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"Against the home team, and Jim Brady, he showed"
3740,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,The place where it lit in the old wagon road!
3741,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,
3742,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Jim Brady’s big brother could bat up a fly
3743,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"That you hardly could see, for it went up so high;"
3744,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,He’d bring up his muscle and break any string
3745,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,That you tied on his arm like it wasn’t a thing!
3746,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"He used to turn handsprings, and cart-wheels, and he"
3747,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"Could jump through his hands just as slick as could be,"
3748,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And circuses often would want him to go
3749,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"And be in the ring, but his mother said no."
3750,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,
3751,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Jim Brady’s big brother would often make bets
3752,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,With boys that he’d turn two complete summersets
3753,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"From off of the spring-board before he would dive,"
3754,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And you’d hardly think he would come up alive;
3755,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And nobody ever who went there to swim
3756,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"Could do it, but it was just easy for him;"
3757,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"And they’d all be scared, so Jim said, when he’d stay"
3758,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,In under and come up a half mile away.
3759,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,
3760,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"Jim Brady’s big brother, so Jim said, could run"
3761,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Five miles in a race just as easy as one.
3762,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,Right often he walked on his hands half a block
3763,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,And could have walked more if he’d wanted to walk!
3764,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"And Jimmy says wait till he comes home from school,"
3765,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,"Where he is gone now, and some day, when it’s cool,"
3766,JIM BRADY’S BIG BROTHER,He’ll get him to prove everything to be true

3812,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,
3813,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,He muffed the fly that lost the game; he never did before;
3814,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,The boys don’t think he’ll ever be light-hearted any more.
3815,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,Our captain didn’t say a word; he just picked up his bat
3816,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,And started home with downcast head--what words could equal that?
3817,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"Nobody spoke on our whole side, or didn’t even ask"
3818,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,How Stubby came to muff the fly. Bud Hicks picked up his mask
3819,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,And sighed an awful sorry sigh. Stub Weeks is not the same--
3820,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"Our boys don’t think he ever will, because he lost the game."
3821,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,
3822,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,Nobody asked him to explain. They couldn’t understand
3823,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,How Stubby dropped it when he had the ball right in his hand.
3824,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,It sailed from Pudgy Williams’ bat and soared just like a bird
3825,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,To center field where Stubby was. Nobody hardly stirred
3826,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"Because it was so critical, but Bud Hicks gave a shout,"
3827,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,He knew a fly in center field was just as good as out
3828,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,When Stubby Weeks was under it. And then he gave a cry
3829,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,Of agony too great for words when Stubby muffed the fly.
3830,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,
3831,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"Our boys all slowly walked away, and even Red Blake’s team"
3832,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,Were too surprised to cheer because it seemed just like a dream.
3833,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"And over there in center field Stub Weeks was dreaming, too,"
3834,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,As though he was Napoleon and this was Waterloo.
3835,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"The blow was such an awful one he acted sort of stunned,"
3836,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,And then he walked in from the field expecting to be shunned
3837,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,Forevermore by all his friends. His throat was hoarse and dry;
3838,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,We knew his heart was broken then because he muffed the fly.
3839,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,
3840,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"He saw us all pick up our things and walk away, and then"
3841,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,The awful stain upon his name came back to him again.
3842,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"He thought of how it should have been--the loud hurrahs and cheers,"
3843,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"And leaned against the back-stop fence and drenched it with his tears,"
3844,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,"Till all the boys felt sorry then, and told him not to mind"
3845,A TRAGEDY OF CENTER FIELD,Because the sun was in his eyes and must have made him blind.

4061,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,She turned and smiled at me;
4062,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"And when she smiled at me, I went"
4063,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"And smiled at Mary Ann,"
4064,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,Out in the kitchen and she lent
4065,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,It to the hired man.
4066,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,
4067,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"So then he smiled at someone, who"

4069,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,Who also smiled and ere he knew
4070,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,Had twinkles in his eye;

4074,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,And smiled back from his work.

4076,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,So when his clerk went home he smiled
4077,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"Right at his wife, and she"
4078,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,Smiled over at their little child
4079,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,As happy as could be;
4080,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"And then their little child, she took"
4081,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"The smile to school, and when"

4083,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,Teacher smiled back again.
4084,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,
4085,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,And then the teacher passed on one
4086,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"To little James McBride,"
4087,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"Who couldn’t get his lessons done,"
4088,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,No matter how he tried;

4090,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,How teacher smiled at him
4091,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"When he was tired and didn’t scold,"
4092,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"But said, “Don’t worry, Jim!”"
4093,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,
4094,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,And when I happened to be there
4095,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"That very night to play,"
4096,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,His mother had a smile to spare
4097,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,Which came across my way;
4098,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,And then I took it after while
4099,THE TOUR OF A SMILE,"Back home, and Mamma said:"

4114,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"Says, My! we’ve got him out of breath and tired as he can be."
4115,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"He says it’s most too much for him to play leap-frog and ball,"

4117,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,
4118,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"He started to play hide and seek, and first he had to blind"
4119,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"And then he ran with all his might to see who he could find,"
4120,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"And Tommy Watkins beat him in from there behind a tree,"
4121,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"Till Grandpa had to give it up and say, “All’s out’s in free!”"
4122,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,And then he sat down on a stump and said he’s tired to death.
4123,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,He had to hold his sides a while till he could catch his breath.
4124,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"He said he’d like to shake a tree and make some apples fall,"
4125,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"But he’s too tired, and we boys here are hardly tired at all!"
4126,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,
4127,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"He only ran in under once when we were in the swing,"
4128,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,And then he had to rest because he’s tired as everything;
4129,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"And once he showed us how to climb a great, tall tree, but when"
4130,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,He only got a few feet up he slid right down again.
4131,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"He said he used to climb a tree, oh, very, very tall"
4132,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"And sit across a branch way up and never tire at all,"
4133,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"But now he’s out of practice, and his legs won’t stay around"
4134,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"The trunk, and he feels safer when he stays down on the ground!"
4135,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,
4136,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"And sometimes when he goes back home and holds us by the hand,"
4137,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"All wringing wet and out of breath, our Ma says “Goodness, Land!"
4138,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,I think you are the youngest boy of all the boys in sight.”
4139,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,But Grandpa rubs his legs and arms and limps and says “Not quite!”
4140,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"And sometimes in the parlor, why, he says he was so strong"
4141,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,When he was just a boy they used to take him right along
4142,WHEN GRANDPA PLAYS,"To lift the heavy things and do the hardest work, you know,"

4153,THE PARTED WAYS,"Who wasn’t very good or bad,"
4154,THE PARTED WAYS,But somewhere in between.
4155,THE PARTED WAYS,He had such freckles on his nose
4156,THE PARTED WAYS,As your nose seems to bear;
4157,THE PARTED WAYS,"Indeed, I’d almost think that those"
4158,THE PARTED WAYS,Were some he used to wear.
4159,THE PARTED WAYS,

4167,THE PARTED WAYS,It could have lived so long.
4168,THE PARTED WAYS,
4169,THE PARTED WAYS,And in his heart he held such song
4170,THE PARTED WAYS,"As fell upon my ear,"
4171,THE PARTED WAYS,And echoed through the shadows long
4172,THE PARTED WAYS,When you came whistling near;
4173,THE PARTED WAYS,"So when at twilight, dawn or noon"

4179,THE PARTED WAYS,"By which he set much store,"
4180,THE PARTED WAYS,"With knives and marbles, tops and strings"
4181,THE PARTED WAYS,And half a hundred more;

4183,THE PARTED WAYS,"Your things cast up with care,"
4184,THE PARTED WAYS,"Until they seem to be, somehow,"
4185,THE PARTED WAYS,His treasures you have there.
4186,THE PARTED WAYS,
4187,THE PARTED WAYS,"I know not where it was or when,"
4188,THE PARTED WAYS,But with his heart of song
4189,THE PARTED WAYS,"He went and came not back again,"
4190,THE PARTED WAYS,And took his dreams along;
4191,THE PARTED WAYS,So some day in a little while
4192,THE PARTED WAYS,He’ll wave a sun-browned hand.

4285,DISGUISING TOIL,"When I was just a little boy and sent to cut the weeds,"
4286,DISGUISING TOIL,I played myself a hero bold and given to mighty deeds;
4287,DISGUISING TOIL,"I played myself an armored knight, my scythe a broadsword keen,"
4288,DISGUISING TOIL,The weeds an army of my foes come marching o’er the green;
4289,DISGUISING TOIL,"I laid my good broadsword about, they broke and ran pell-mell,"
4290,DISGUISING TOIL,At every stroke some stubborn lout and his retainers fell.
4291,DISGUISING TOIL,"And when I told them of my play, with lusty shouts and glee,"
4292,DISGUISING TOIL,The neighbor boys brought scythes and fell to cutting weeds for me.
4293,DISGUISING TOIL,
4294,DISGUISING TOIL,"When I was just a little boy and sent to cut the wood,"
4295,DISGUISING TOIL,"I played myself a frontier scout, six feet in buckskin stood;"

4297,DISGUISING TOIL,Must be quick hewed and fashioned for an old frontier stockade;
4298,DISGUISING TOIL,"Quick fell my axe with flashing blade, for all about I heard"

4300,DISGUISING TOIL,"And when I told them of my play, with lusty strokes and cry,"

4309,DISGUISING TOIL,"And when I told them of my play, with many a lusty shout,"
4310,DISGUISING TOIL,The neighbor boys plied hose and broom to put the fire out.
4311,DISGUISING TOIL,
4312,DISGUISING TOIL,And when I had to shovel snow I led’ some hardy band
4313,DISGUISING TOIL,"Of undismayed discoverers, in far-off Arctic land;"
4314,DISGUISING TOIL,"With stores and goods and blubber, too, all buried deep below"
4315,DISGUISING TOIL,The mark that I had left beneath some good six feet of snow;
4316,DISGUISING TOIL,"And almost famished, there I dug, full knowing I should find"
4317,DISGUISING TOIL,At last the goodly stores of stuff that we had left behind.
4318,DISGUISING TOIL,"And when I told them of my play, with many a lusty shout,"

4361,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"My Daddy, he lived in a wonderful house, and he played with such wonderful"
4362,MY WONDERFUL DAD,boys;
4363,MY WONDERFUL DAD,They were neighbors of his; and the attic they had was a storehouse of
4364,MY WONDERFUL DAD,wonderful toys;
4365,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"He slept every night in a wonderful bed, with a tick that his grandmother"
4366,MY WONDERFUL DAD,made
4367,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"From the feathers of geese that she picked all herself, and so soft he was"
4368,MY WONDERFUL DAD,almost afraid
4369,MY WONDERFUL DAD,He would sink out of sight when he got into bed; he could look from his
4370,MY WONDERFUL DAD,window right out
4371,MY WONDERFUL DAD,And see where the vines used to bring him sweet flowers just by crawling
4372,MY WONDERFUL DAD,along up the spout;
4373,MY WONDERFUL DAD,And he could look over and see where the woods and the squirrels and birds
4374,MY WONDERFUL DAD,used to be.
4375,MY WONDERFUL DAD,He must have had wonderful times where he lived from the way that he tells
4376,MY WONDERFUL DAD,them to me!
4377,MY WONDERFUL DAD,
4378,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"My Daddy, he caught the most wonderful fish--there were thin ones and fat"
4379,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"ones and round,"
4380,MY WONDERFUL DAD,And some were so long that their tails when he walked would be dragging right
4381,MY WONDERFUL DAD,down on the ground;
4382,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"He scraped off their scales on a log that he had at the woodpile, and said"
4383,MY WONDERFUL DAD,he would know
4384,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"That log just as well if he saw it today, although that was a long time ago."
4385,MY WONDERFUL DAD,He used to dig worms of a wonderful size--he has never seen any like those
4386,MY WONDERFUL DAD,Since he was grown up; and on Saturdays he wore a wonderful old suit of clothes
4387,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"And a hat that an uncle of his had forgot, for on Friday he did all his sums,"
4388,MY WONDERFUL DAD,And Saturday always he went off somewhere with his one or two wonderful chums.
4389,MY WONDERFUL DAD,
4390,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"My Daddy, he lived in a wonderful place when he was a twelve-year-old lad,"
4391,MY WONDERFUL DAD,For no matter what kind of a day it might be there was always some fun to
4392,MY WONDERFUL DAD,be had.
4393,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"He learned how to swim in a wonderful creek, where all of the whole summer"
4394,MY WONDERFUL DAD,long
4395,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"The water was warm, and the springboard they had it was springy and slippery"
4396,MY WONDERFUL DAD,and strong.
4397,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"And on the way home they found berries to eat, and he said he remembers them"
4398,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"well,"
4399,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"And it didn’t seem nearly a mile to back home, for there always was"
4400,MY WONDERFUL DAD,something to tell
4401,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"That took up the time both for him and his chums, and sometimes they came"
4402,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"home a new way,"
4403,MY WONDERFUL DAD,And always all summer they had it all planned what to do on the next Saturday.
4404,MY WONDERFUL DAD,
4405,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"My Daddy, he said he could go back there now and could take me as straight"
4406,MY WONDERFUL DAD,as a string
4407,MY WONDERFUL DAD,To all of the wonderful places he knew--where the first flowers came in the
4408,MY WONDERFUL DAD,spring;
4409,MY WONDERFUL DAD,Where you almost were sure to catch fish in the brook--where the nuts would
4410,MY WONDERFUL DAD,come dropping in fall;
4411,MY WONDERFUL DAD,Where the most berries were on the way to back home--he is sure he remembers
4412,MY WONDERFUL DAD,them all.
4413,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"He knows where the squirrels were most apt to be, and the lane where the"
4414,MY WONDERFUL DAD,hay wagon comes;
4415,MY WONDERFUL DAD,And said he’d find names in the bark of a tree that were cut there by him
4416,MY WONDERFUL DAD,and his chums
4417,MY WONDERFUL DAD,"Twenty-five years ago, and the log where they sat when they found the big"
4418,MY WONDERFUL DAD,garter-snake curled.

4626,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Tim Brooks he studies awful hard
4627,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"And faithful all the year,"
4628,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But goes out in the school house yard
4629,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And never gets a cheer;
4630,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"And Billy Gibbs, he shirks and frets--"
4631,THE UNCHEERED HERO,He hates to work at all--
4632,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But you should hear the cheer he gets
4633,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Because he hits the ball.
4634,THE UNCHEERED HERO,
4635,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Tim Brooks he always leads his class
4636,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And gets his lessons done;
4637,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But Billy Gibbs lets hours pass
4638,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Just thinking up some fun;
4639,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But no one cheers and throws his hat
4640,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And says: “Hurrah for Tim!”
4641,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But when Bill Gibbs goes up to bat
4642,THE UNCHEERED HERO,The boys all cheer for him.
4643,THE UNCHEERED HERO,
4644,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Bill Gibbs he suffers awful pain
4645,THE UNCHEERED HERO,When he comes to recite;
4646,THE UNCHEERED HERO,He cannot do his sums again
4647,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Or get his grammar right;
4648,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Then teacher calls on Timmy Brooks
4649,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"And points to him with pride,"
4650,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But when we play a game she looks
4651,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And cheers for Bill outside.
4652,THE UNCHEERED HERO,
4653,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Sometimes Tim Brooks he sees the game
4654,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"And watches Bill at bat,"
4655,THE UNCHEERED HERO,He gets excited just the same
4656,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And cheers and throws his hat;
4657,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But when he has his sums in school
4658,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"And Bill is watching him,"
4659,THE UNCHEERED HERO,Bill quite forgets the Golden Rule
4660,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And never cheers for Tim.
4661,THE UNCHEERED HERO,
4662,THE UNCHEERED HERO,I guess I’d rather be like Tim
4663,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"Than Billy Gibbs, but when"
4664,THE UNCHEERED HERO,The boys outside are cheering him
4665,THE UNCHEERED HERO,It sounds quite pleasant then;
4666,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And it must sometimes seem quite hard
4667,THE UNCHEERED HERO,"To study all the year,"
4668,THE UNCHEERED HERO,And go out in the school house yard
4669,THE UNCHEERED HERO,But never get a cheer!

4677,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"Oho! Mr. Ghost, with your raiment of white,"
4678,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,Come to frighten me out of my wits in the night!
4679,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,With your eyes flaming forth like two coals and your breath
4680,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,Bearing fire that would scare a poor mortal to death;
4681,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,With your rows of great teeth grinning widely at me
4682,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,And your loose-hanging gown flapping under the tree
4683,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"In the orchard out there--Oh! I know how you’re made,"
4684,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"And the youngsters who made you, so I’m not afraid."

4687,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"You’re an old friend of mine, both trustworthy and true;"
4688,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,For that big head of yours that near gave me a fright
4689,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,Was in somebody’s pumpkin patch only last night.
4690,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,And out of my window not two hours ago
4691,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"I saw your head scooped out by Bill, Jack, and Joe;"
4692,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,And I saw you stuck up on the end of a lath
4693,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,Before you were stationed right here in my path.
4694,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,
4695,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"Oho! Mr. Ghost, with your garments so fine!"
4696,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,I know what became of that sheet on the line
4697,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"In the neighbor’s back yard, newly washed and alone,"
4698,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,It is hiding that lath that you use for backbone.
4699,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,And the candle that burned in the kitchen last night
4700,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,Lights those cavernous eyes that near gave me a fright;
4701,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"Indeed, you are made from such odds and such ends"
4702,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,That I feel we’re the warmest of very old friends.
4703,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,
4704,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"And those sepulchral groans you are making at me,"
4705,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,I know whence they come--from that big apple tree
4706,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,That is right behind you--I have heard them before;
4707,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,They were begging for cake at the side kitchen door.
4708,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"So you see, Mr. Ghost, with your pumpkin and lath,"
4709,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"With your candle and sheet, when I came up the path"
4710,OLD HALLOWE’EN FRIENDS,"I heard a boy chuckle up there in the tree,"

4749,A REFUGE IN DISTRESS,He don’t know what to do.
4750,A REFUGE IN DISTRESS,"He’s just as helpless as can be,"

4768,THE LOST HEART,
4769,THE LOST HEART,
4770,THE LOST HEART,"Back among the trees and trellises, along the leaf-strewn lane,"
4771,THE LOST HEART,"Sitting on the bank of the mill stream and dreaming dreams again,"
4772,THE LOST HEART,"Drinking water sweet as nectar from the bucket at the well,"
4773,THE LOST HEART,"In the orchard’s leaf and silence, watching windfalls as they fell,"
4774,THE LOST HEART,"Trying here, at five and thirty, just to be a boy again,"
4775,THE LOST HEART,To recall the joys of boyhood and forget the cares of men;
4776,THE LOST HEART,But I listen to a lesson in the twitter of the wren:
4777,THE LOST HEART,When the boy’s heart turns to man’s it never throbs the same again.
4778,THE LOST HEART,
4779,THE LOST HEART,"Once the sun marks noon of lifetime, once the morning steals away,"
4780,THE LOST HEART,"Once the shadows growing shorter and then fall the other way,"
4781,THE LOST HEART,"Once the play time ends at manhood, once the frolicking is done,"
4782,THE LOST HEART,"Once the face is turned from dawning to the setting of the sun,"
4783,THE LOST HEART,"You may sit among the flowers that you plucked and threw away,"
4784,THE LOST HEART,"Turn the leaves of Time all backward, try to read them as you may,"
4785,THE LOST HEART,"You may kindle fires of Memory, you may sit and watch the flame,"
4786,THE LOST HEART,But there’s something changed within you that can never be the same.
4787,THE LOST HEART,
4788,THE LOST HEART,"You may lay aside the burden of your troubles as you will,"
4789,THE LOST HEART,But the bent and sunken shoulders tell the story to you still;
4790,THE LOST HEART,The story of the troubles and the trials that are sealed
4791,THE LOST HEART,"From the simple hearts of children, and to men alone revealed."
4792,THE LOST HEART,"The sorrow dulls, the sigh is stilled, the sore hearts soothed are,"
4793,THE LOST HEART,"The smarting wound is healed again, but always leaves a scar,"
4794,THE LOST HEART,"The fire of youth burns only once, and dies in its dead flame,"
4795,THE LOST HEART,The simple heart of boyhood that can never be the same.
4796,THE LOST HEART,
4797,THE LOST HEART,So I sit among the trellises and trees and wonder why:
4798,THE LOST HEART,"Clear the air as in my boyhood and as blue the unflecked sky,"
4799,THE LOST HEART,"Full the leaves as ever blowing, sweet the bird songs and as free,"
4800,THE LOST HEART,But the boy’s heart that throbbed to them is untuned and dead in me.
4801,THE LOST HEART,"There’s a longing, longing, longing, speaking in a deep-drawn sigh,"
4802,THE LOST HEART,"For the heart that throbbed in boyhood, cloudless as the azure sky;"
4803,THE LOST HEART,For the heart that was the sunlight and the air--that tongue nor pen
4804,THE LOST HEART,Can ever paint or picture--that I cannot know again.

4864,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,Say the flaming circus posters in the little country town.
4865,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,
4866,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,"They have wielded monster brushes from the dewy hours of morn,"

4869,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,They have ornamented Slowville with a wealth of daring deeds;
4870,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,"They have left a Ripperumptus on the back of Robbin’s fence,"
4871,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,Captured in the wilds of Africa at marvelous expense;
4872,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,They’ve a retinue of big-eyed lads as they move up and down
4873,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,When they put up circus posters in the little country town.
4874,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,
4875,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,Oh! the multicolored marvels done in wonder-rousing haste
4876,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,With a broad red barn for background and no means but brush and paste.
4877,GOLDEN DAYS IN SLOWVILLE,"“Hi, there, Jimmy! See the monkeys!” All the air is shrill with cries"

4971,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
4972,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Sew, sew, sew! For there’s many a rent to mend;"
4973,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"There’s a stitch to take and a dress to make,"
4974,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,For where do her labors end?
4975,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Sew, sew, sew! For a rent in a dress she spies,"
4976,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,Then it’s needle and thread and an aching head
4977,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,And see how the needle flies!
4978,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
4979,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Brush, brush, brush! For there’s many a boy to clean,"

4982,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Comb, comb, comb! In the minute she has to spare,"
4983,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,For what is so wild--unreconciled

4985,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
4986,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Sweep, sweep, sweep! Oh, follow the flashing broom,"
4987,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,And with towel bound her forehead round
4988,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,She goes from room to room.
4989,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Dust, dust, dust! As down on her knees she kneels,"
4990,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,For there’s much to do in the hour or two
4991,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,Of interval ’twixt meals.
4992,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
4993,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Bake, bake, bake! For the cookie jar piled high"

4995,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Is empty again, Oh my!"
4996,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Stir, stir, stir, in the froth of yellow and white,"
4997,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,For well she knows how the story goes
4998,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,Of a small boy’s appetite.
4999,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
5000,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Scrub, scrub, scrub! For the floor that was spick and span,"
5001,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Alas, alack! has a muddy track"
5002,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,Where some thoughtless youngster ran.
5003,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Splash, splash, splash! For the dishes of thrice a day"
5004,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,Are piled up high to wash and dry
5005,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,And put on the shelves away.
5006,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
5007,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Patch, patch, patch! And oh for a pantaloon"
5008,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,That would not tear or rip or wear
5009,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,In the course of an afternoon!
5010,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Patch, patch, patch! And see how the needle flies,"
5011,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,For a mother knows how the fabric goes
5012,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,Where the seat of trouble lies.
5013,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,
5014,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Toil, toil, toil! For when do her labors end,"
5015,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,With a dress to make and a cake to bake
5016,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,And dresses and hose to mend?
5017,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,"Stew, stew, stew! Fret and worry and fuss,"
5018,A SONG OF MOTHERHOOD,And who of us knows of the frets and woes

5078,AFTER THE YEARS,When you went back to the old home place had the mountain become a hill?
5079,AFTER THE YEARS,Had the raging river your boyhood knew shrunk down to a peaceful rill?
5080,AFTER THE YEARS,Were the monster trees in the old front yard but half of their former size?
5081,AFTER THE YEARS,Was something gone--and you don’t know what what--from the blue of
5082,AFTER THE YEARS,the arching skies?
5083,AFTER THE YEARS,Was the swimming-hole but a muddy pool when once it was crystal clear?
5084,AFTER THE YEARS,Were the apples but half as big and red as they were in that other year?
5085,AFTER THE YEARS,
5086,AFTER THE YEARS,When you went back to the old home place did the red barn seem so small
5087,AFTER THE YEARS,It didn’t look like the one you’d known? Was the mighty waterfall
5088,AFTER THE YEARS,That used to roar in your boyish ears but a little dash of spray
5089,AFTER THE YEARS,That fell so light you could hardly hear a dozen feet away?
5090,AFTER THE YEARS,"Were the corn rows only half as long as they were in the long ago,"
5091,AFTER THE YEARS,When you measured them with aching arms and the weight of a heavy hoe?
5092,AFTER THE YEARS,
5093,AFTER THE YEARS,When you went back to the old home place had the mill pond dwindled down?
5094,AFTER THE YEARS,Was Main Street only a muddy track in the heart of a sleepy town?

5097,AFTER THE YEARS,Did it seem to you like a shrunken thing when you looked at it again?

5100,AFTER THE YEARS,
5101,AFTER THE YEARS,"Nay, Heart, the mountain rises high as it did of yore; the rill"
5102,AFTER THE YEARS,Was a river once and the boys near by see a raging river still.
5103,AFTER THE YEARS,"The well is fathoms, fathoms deep and the apples ripe and red;"
5104,AFTER THE YEARS,"The sod is cool and green and soft, and the sky up overhead"
5105,AFTER THE YEARS,"Is blue and clear, and the days are rare and glad as they used to be--"

5118,A VERSE TO MEMORY,We stray through Flowerland;
5119,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"And like the child, sweet Memory"
5120,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"By many a by-way strays,"
5121,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Plucks flowers and bears them back to me
5122,A VERSE TO MEMORY,To fashion my bouquets.
5123,A VERSE TO MEMORY,
5124,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"By many sweet, secluded ways"
5125,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"She wanders, far or near;"
5126,A VERSE TO MEMORY,A rose upon my garland lays
5127,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Bejeweled with a tear;

5129,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"A fragrance, ah, how rare!"
5130,A VERSE TO MEMORY,My fingers close but to reveal
5131,A VERSE TO MEMORY,The ashes crumbling there.
5132,A VERSE TO MEMORY,
5133,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Now tinkling laughter ripples clear
5134,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"As some new flower she spies,"
5135,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Some far-forgotten joys appear

5137,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"My thoughts in revel, flower-wreathed,"

5143,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"The flower in ashes, dead;"
5144,A VERSE TO MEMORY,The perfume with the air that blends
5145,A VERSE TO MEMORY,We’ll bear away instead.
5146,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"Here at the hedge we kiss and part,"
5147,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Some sterner duties find.
5148,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Bear all the sweetness in the heart
5149,A VERSE TO MEMORY,But leave the flowers behind.
5150,A VERSE TO MEMORY,
5151,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"Thank God, thank God for Memory,"
5152,A VERSE TO MEMORY,Half smile and half a tear;
5153,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"The flowers are there eternally,"
5154,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"And when the days are drear,"
5155,A VERSE TO MEMORY,In through the tangled hedge of days
5156,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"We wander, hand in hand,"
5157,A VERSE TO MEMORY,"And I may dream, while Memory strays,"
5158,A VERSE TO MEMORY,A child is Flowerland.

5458,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY
5459,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
5460,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
5461,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,One time in vacation we boys all left town
5462,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,To stay in the country for Sunday; and down
5463,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,By Deacon Gray’s pasture a rabbit came out
5464,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,Right close to the highway and looked all about
5465,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,Until it saw us and it started to run
5466,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,Right down the highroad like a shot from a gun;
5467,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,So Billy Beggs threw off his coat and his hat
5468,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"And chased it till both of its ears were down flat,"
5469,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"And, my, it just ran as if it saw a ghost,"
5470,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And Bill ran so fast that he caught it--almost!
5471,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
5472,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And under the bridge where it crosses the creek
5473,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,We saw some fish swimming and darting as quick
5474,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"As a flash in the water, and one fish would flop"
5475,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,Himself till he almost would come to the top;
5476,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,So then we got down on the bridge and we tied
5477,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,A pin on a string and dropped it down the side
5478,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"With a bug on the pin, and the fishes would look"
5479,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,While Billy Beggs wiggled the bug on the hook;
5480,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And one fish was hungry and came up so close
5481,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,That Bill gave a jerk and he caught it--almost!
5482,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
5483,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And over by Skinner’s a big hawk flew by
5484,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"And lit on a stump that was not very high,"
5485,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,But didn’t see us and we crawled up quite slow
5486,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,Through the grass to the stump with a big stone to throw;
5487,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And Billy Beggs said that the hawk was asleep
5488,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,For it never stirred once; and the grass was so deep
5489,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"That we got to within a few feet from the stump,"
5490,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"And Billy Beggs peeked, and his heart gave a thump;"
5491,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And when he got ever and ever so close
5492,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,He stood up and threw and he hit it--almost!
5493,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
5494,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And then it got cloudy and thundered and then
5495,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,It lightened just awful and thundered again;
5496,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,It rained some big drops and we started to run
5497,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,To get in the barn till the shower was done;
5498,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And lightning just spattered and crackled and flashed
5499,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"And we were all scared as could be, and we splashed"
5500,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"All through mud and water, and then a big crack"
5501,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,Of lightning came down and Bill Beggs hollered back
5502,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"From ’way up ahead, just as pale as a ghost,"
5503,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And said that last lightning had struck him--almost!
5504,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
5505,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And over by Griggs’s somebody came out
5506,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And hollered to us when we’re all just about
5507,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,"So tired we could drop, and they took us right in"
5508,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,By the big kitchen fire ’cause we’re wet to the skin;
5509,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And Mrs. Griggs gave us some blankets to wear
5510,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,While all of our clothes were hung over a chair;
5511,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And she made some tea till she got us warmed through
5512,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And then the storm stopped and the sky got all blue;
5513,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,And Billy Beggs told her the flash came so close
5514,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,That he ’membered the whole of the Lord’s Prayer--almost!
5515,AN ADVENTUROUS DAY,
