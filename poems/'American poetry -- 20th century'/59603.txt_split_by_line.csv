105,UP IN MICHIGAN,
106,UP IN MICHIGAN,Jim Gilmore came to Hortons Bay from Canada. He bought the blacksmith
107,UP IN MICHIGAN,shop from old man Horton. Jim was short and dark with big mustaches
108,UP IN MICHIGAN,and big hands. He was a good horseshoer and did not look much like a
109,UP IN MICHIGAN,blacksmith even with his leather apron on. He lived upstairs above
110,UP IN MICHIGAN,the blacksmith shop and took his meals at A. J. Smith’s.
111,UP IN MICHIGAN,
112,UP IN MICHIGAN,"Liz Coates worked for Smith’s. Mrs. Smith, who was a very large clean"
113,UP IN MICHIGAN,"woman, said Liz Coates was the neatest girl she’d ever seen. Liz had"
114,UP IN MICHIGAN,good legs and always wore clean gingham aprons and Jim noticed that
115,UP IN MICHIGAN,her hair was always neat behind. He liked her face because it was so
116,UP IN MICHIGAN,jolly but he never thought about her.
117,UP IN MICHIGAN,
118,UP IN MICHIGAN,Liz liked Jim very much. She liked it the way he walked over from the
119,UP IN MICHIGAN,shop and often went to the kitchen door to watch for him to start
120,UP IN MICHIGAN,down the road. She liked it about his mustache. She liked it about
121,UP IN MICHIGAN,how white his teeth were when he smiled. She liked it very much that
122,UP IN MICHIGAN,he didn’t look like a blacksmith. She liked it how much A. J. Smith
123,UP IN MICHIGAN,and Mrs. Smith liked Jim. One day she found that she liked it the way
124,UP IN MICHIGAN,the hair was black on his arms and how white they were above the
125,UP IN MICHIGAN,tanned line when he washed up in the washbasin outside the house.
126,UP IN MICHIGAN,Liking that made her feel funny.
127,UP IN MICHIGAN,
128,UP IN MICHIGAN,"Hortons Bay, the town, was only five houses on the main road between"
129,UP IN MICHIGAN,Boyne City and Charlevoix. There was the general store and postoffice
130,UP IN MICHIGAN,"with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front,"
131,UP IN MICHIGAN,"Smith’s house, Stroud’s house, Fox’s house, Horton’s house and Van"
132,UP IN MICHIGAN,Hoosen’s house. The houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the
133,UP IN MICHIGAN,road was very sandy. There was farming country and timber each way up
134,UP IN MICHIGAN,the road. Up the road a ways was the Methodist church and down the
135,UP IN MICHIGAN,road the other direction was the township school. The blacksmith shop
136,UP IN MICHIGAN,was painted red and faced the school.
137,UP IN MICHIGAN,
138,UP IN MICHIGAN,A steep sandy road ran down the hill to the bay through the timber.
139,UP IN MICHIGAN,From Smith’s back door you could look out across the woods that ran
140,UP IN MICHIGAN,down to the lake and across the bay. It was very beautiful in the
141,UP IN MICHIGAN,"spring and summer, the bay blue and bright and usually whitecaps on"
142,UP IN MICHIGAN,the lake out beyond the point from the breeze blowing from Charlevoix
143,UP IN MICHIGAN,and Lake Michigan. From Smith’s back door Liz could see ore barges
144,UP IN MICHIGAN,way out in the lake going toward Boyne City. When she looked at them
145,UP IN MICHIGAN,they didn’t seem to be moving at all but if she went in and dried
146,UP IN MICHIGAN,some more dishes and then came out again they would be out of sight
147,UP IN MICHIGAN,beyond the point.
148,UP IN MICHIGAN,
149,UP IN MICHIGAN,All the time now Liz was thinking about Jim Gilmore. He didn’t seem
150,UP IN MICHIGAN,to notice her much. He talked about the shop to A. J. Smith and about
151,UP IN MICHIGAN,the Republican Party and about James G. Blaine. In the evenings he
152,UP IN MICHIGAN,read the Toledo Blade and the Grand Rapids paper by the lamp in the
153,UP IN MICHIGAN,front room or went out spearing fish in the bay with a jacklight with
154,UP IN MICHIGAN,A. J. Smith. In the fall he and Smith and Charley Wyman took a wagon
155,UP IN MICHIGAN,"and tent, grub, axes, their rifles and two dogs and went on a trip to"
156,UP IN MICHIGAN,the pine plains beyond Vanderbilt deer hunting. Liz and Mrs. Smith
157,UP IN MICHIGAN,were cooking for four days for them before they started. Liz wanted
158,UP IN MICHIGAN,to make something special for Jim to take but she didn’t finally
159,UP IN MICHIGAN,because she was afraid to ask Mrs. Smith for the eggs and flour and
160,UP IN MICHIGAN,afraid if she bought them Mrs. Smith would catch her cooking. It
161,UP IN MICHIGAN,would have been all right with Mrs. Smith but Liz was afraid.
162,UP IN MICHIGAN,
163,UP IN MICHIGAN,All the time Jim was gone on the deer hunting trip Liz thought about
164,UP IN MICHIGAN,him. It was awful while he was gone. She couldn’t sleep well from
165,UP IN MICHIGAN,thinking about him but she discovered it was fun to think about him
166,UP IN MICHIGAN,too. If she let herself go it was better. The night before they were
167,UP IN MICHIGAN,"to come back she didn’t sleep at all, that is she didn’t think she"
168,UP IN MICHIGAN,slept because it was all mixed up in a dream about not sleeping and
169,UP IN MICHIGAN,really not sleeping. When she saw the wagon coming down the road she
170,UP IN MICHIGAN,felt weak and sick sort of inside. She couldn’t wait till she saw Jim
171,UP IN MICHIGAN,and it seemed as though everything would be all right when he came.
172,UP IN MICHIGAN,The wagon stopped outside under the big elm and Mrs. Smith and Liz
173,UP IN MICHIGAN,went out. All the men had beards and there were three deer in the
174,UP IN MICHIGAN,"back of the wagon, their thin legs sticking stiff over the edge of"
175,UP IN MICHIGAN,the wagon box. Mrs. Smith kissed Alonzo and he hugged her. Jim said
176,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Hello Liz.” and grinned. Liz hadn’t known just what would happen
177,UP IN MICHIGAN,when Jim got back but she was sure it would be something. Nothing had
178,UP IN MICHIGAN,happened. The men were just home that was all. Jim pulled the burlap
179,UP IN MICHIGAN,sacks off the deer and Liz looked at them. One was a big buck. It was
180,UP IN MICHIGAN,stiff and hard to lift out of the wagon.
181,UP IN MICHIGAN,
182,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Did you shoot it Jim?” Liz asked.
183,UP IN MICHIGAN,
184,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Yeah. Aint it a beauty?” Jim got it onto his back to carry to the
185,UP IN MICHIGAN,smokehouse.
186,UP IN MICHIGAN,
187,UP IN MICHIGAN,That night Charley Wyman stayed to supper at Smith’s. It was too late
188,UP IN MICHIGAN,to get back to Charlevoix. The men washed up and waited in the front
189,UP IN MICHIGAN,room for supper.
190,UP IN MICHIGAN,
191,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Aint there something left in that crock Jimmy?” A. J. Smith asked
192,UP IN MICHIGAN,and Jim went out to the wagon in the barn and fetched in the jug of
193,UP IN MICHIGAN,whiskey the men had taken hunting with them. It was a four gallon jug
194,UP IN MICHIGAN,and there was quite a little slopped back and forth in the bottom.
195,UP IN MICHIGAN,Jim took a long pull on his way back to the house. It was hard to
196,UP IN MICHIGAN,lift such a big jug up to drink out of it. Some of the whiskey ran
197,UP IN MICHIGAN,down on his shirt front. The two men smiled when Jim came in with the
198,UP IN MICHIGAN,jug. A. J. Smith sent for glasses and Liz brought them. A. J. poured
199,UP IN MICHIGAN,out three big shots.
200,UP IN MICHIGAN,
201,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Well here’s looking at you A. J.” said Charley Wyman.
202,UP IN MICHIGAN,
203,UP IN MICHIGAN,“That damn big buck Jimmy.” said A. J.
204,UP IN MICHIGAN,
205,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Here’s all the ones we missed A. J.” said Jim and downed his liquor.
206,UP IN MICHIGAN,
207,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Tastes good to a man.”
208,UP IN MICHIGAN,
209,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Nothing like it this time of year for what ails you.”
210,UP IN MICHIGAN,
211,UP IN MICHIGAN,“How about another boys?”
212,UP IN MICHIGAN,
213,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Here’s how A. J.”
214,UP IN MICHIGAN,
215,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Down the creek boys.”
216,UP IN MICHIGAN,
217,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Here’s to next year.”
218,UP IN MICHIGAN,
219,UP IN MICHIGAN,Jim began to feel great. He loved the taste and the feel of whisky.
220,UP IN MICHIGAN,He was glad to be back to a comfortable bed and warm food and the
221,UP IN MICHIGAN,shop. He had another drink. The men came in to supper feeling
222,UP IN MICHIGAN,hilarious but acting very respectable. Liz sat at the table after she
223,UP IN MICHIGAN,put on the food and ate with the family. It was a good dinner. The
224,UP IN MICHIGAN,men ate seriously. After supper they went into the front room again
225,UP IN MICHIGAN,and Liz cleaned off with Mrs. Smith. Then Mrs. Smith went up stairs
226,UP IN MICHIGAN,and pretty soon Smith came out and went up stairs too. Jim and
227,UP IN MICHIGAN,Charley were still in the front room. Liz was sitting in the kitchen
228,UP IN MICHIGAN,next to the stove pretending to read a book and thinking about Jim.
229,UP IN MICHIGAN,She didn’t want to go to bed yet because she knew Jim would be coming
230,UP IN MICHIGAN,out and she wanted to see him as he went out so she could take the
231,UP IN MICHIGAN,way he looked up to bed with her.
232,UP IN MICHIGAN,
233,UP IN MICHIGAN,She was thinking about him hard and then Jim came out. His eyes were
234,UP IN MICHIGAN,shining and his hair was a little rumpled. Liz looked down at her
235,UP IN MICHIGAN,book. Jim came over back of her chair and stood there and she could
236,UP IN MICHIGAN,feel him breathing and then he put his arms around her. Her breasts
237,UP IN MICHIGAN,felt plump and firm and the nipples were erect under his hands. Liz
238,UP IN MICHIGAN,"was terribly frightened, no one had ever touched her, but she"
239,UP IN MICHIGAN,"thought, “He’s come to me finally. He’s really come.”"
240,UP IN MICHIGAN,
241,UP IN MICHIGAN,She held herself stiff because she was so frightened and did not know
242,UP IN MICHIGAN,anything else to do and then Jim held her tight against the chair and
243,UP IN MICHIGAN,"kissed her. It was such a sharp, aching, hurting feeling that she"
244,UP IN MICHIGAN,thought she couldn’t stand it. She felt Jim right through the back of
245,UP IN MICHIGAN,the chair and she couldn’t stand it and then something clicked inside
246,UP IN MICHIGAN,of her and the feeling was warmer and softer. Jim held her tight hard
247,UP IN MICHIGAN,"against the chair and she wanted it now and Jim whispered, “Come on"
248,UP IN MICHIGAN,for a walk.”
249,UP IN MICHIGAN,
250,UP IN MICHIGAN,Liz took her coat off the peg on the kitchen wall and they went out
251,UP IN MICHIGAN,the door. Jim had his arm around her and every little way they
252,UP IN MICHIGAN,stopped and pressed against each other and Jim kissed her. There was
253,UP IN MICHIGAN,no moon and they walked ankle deep in the sandy road through the
254,UP IN MICHIGAN,trees down to the dock and the warehouse on the bay. The water was
255,UP IN MICHIGAN,lapping in the piles and the point was dark across the bay. It was
256,UP IN MICHIGAN,cold but Liz was hot all over from being with Jim. They sat down in
257,UP IN MICHIGAN,the shelter of the warehouse and Jim pulled Liz close to him. She was
258,UP IN MICHIGAN,frightened. One of Jim’s hands went inside her dress and stroked over
259,UP IN MICHIGAN,her breast and the other hand was in her lap. She was very frightened
260,UP IN MICHIGAN,and didn’t know how he was going to go about things but she snuggled
261,UP IN MICHIGAN,close to him. Then the hand that felt so big in her lap went away and
262,UP IN MICHIGAN,was on her leg and started to move up it.
263,UP IN MICHIGAN,
264,UP IN MICHIGAN,“Don’t Jim”. Liz said. Jim slid the hand further up.
265,UP IN MICHIGAN,
266,UP IN MICHIGAN,“You musn’t Jim. You musn’t”. Neither Jim nor Jim’s big hand paid any
267,UP IN MICHIGAN,attention to her.
268,UP IN MICHIGAN,
269,UP IN MICHIGAN,The boards were hard. Jim had her dress up and was trying to do
270,UP IN MICHIGAN,something to her. She was frightened but she wanted it. She had to
271,UP IN MICHIGAN,have it but it frightened her.
272,UP IN MICHIGAN,
273,UP IN MICHIGAN,“You musn’t do it Jim. You musn’t.”
274,UP IN MICHIGAN,
275,UP IN MICHIGAN,“I got to. I’m going to. You know we got to.”
276,UP IN MICHIGAN,
277,UP IN MICHIGAN,“No we haven’t Jim. We aint got to. Oh it isn’t right. Oh it’s so big
278,UP IN MICHIGAN,and it hurts so. You can’t. Oh Jim. Jim. Oh.”
279,UP IN MICHIGAN,
280,UP IN MICHIGAN,The hemlock planks of the dock were hard and splintery and cold and
281,UP IN MICHIGAN,"Jim was heavy on her and he had hurt her. Liz pushed him, she was so"
282,UP IN MICHIGAN,uncomfortable and cramped. Jim was asleep. He wouldn’t move. She
283,UP IN MICHIGAN,worked out from under him and sat up and straightened her skirt and
284,UP IN MICHIGAN,coat and tried to do something with her hair. Jim was sleeping with
285,UP IN MICHIGAN,his mouth a little open. Liz leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.
286,UP IN MICHIGAN,He was still asleep. She lifted his head a little and shook it. He
287,UP IN MICHIGAN,rolled his head over and swallowed. Liz started to cry. She walked
288,UP IN MICHIGAN,over to the edge of the dock and looked down to the water. There was
289,UP IN MICHIGAN,a mist coming up from the bay. She was cold and miserable and
290,UP IN MICHIGAN,everything felt gone. She walked back to where Jim was lying and
291,UP IN MICHIGAN,shook him once more to make sure. She was crying.
292,UP IN MICHIGAN,
293,UP IN MICHIGAN,"“Jim” she said, “Jim. Please Jim”."
294,UP IN MICHIGAN,
295,UP IN MICHIGAN,Jim stirred and curled a little tighter. Liz took off her coat and
296,UP IN MICHIGAN,leaned over and covered him with it. She tucked it around him neatly
297,UP IN MICHIGAN,and carefully. Then she walked across the dock and up the steep sandy
298,UP IN MICHIGAN,road to go to bed. A cold mist was coming up through the woods from
299,UP IN MICHIGAN,the bay.

308,OUT OF SEASON,
309,OUT OF SEASON,
310,OUT OF SEASON,On the four lira he had earned by spading the hotel garden he got
311,OUT OF SEASON,quite drunk. He saw the young gentleman coming down the path and
312,OUT OF SEASON,spoke to him mysteriously. The young gentleman said he had not eaten
313,OUT OF SEASON,yet but would be ready to go as soon as lunch was finished. Forty
314,OUT OF SEASON,minutes or an hour.
315,OUT OF SEASON,
316,OUT OF SEASON,At the cantina near the bridge they trusted him for three more
317,OUT OF SEASON,grappas because he was so confident and mysterious about his job for
318,OUT OF SEASON,the afternoon. It was a windy day with the sun coming out from behind
319,OUT OF SEASON,clouds and then going under in sprinkles of rain. A wonderful day for
320,OUT OF SEASON,trout fishing.
321,OUT OF SEASON,
322,OUT OF SEASON,The young gentleman came out of the hotel and asked him about the
323,OUT OF SEASON,"rods. Should his wife come behind with the rods? Yes, said Peduzzi,"
324,OUT OF SEASON,let her follow us. The young gentleman went back into the hotel and
325,OUT OF SEASON,spoke to his wife. He and Peduzzi started down the road. The young
326,OUT OF SEASON,"gentleman had a musette over his shoulder. Peduzzi saw the wife, who"
327,OUT OF SEASON,looked as young as the young gentleman and was wearing mountain boots
328,OUT OF SEASON,"and a blue beret, start out to follow them down the road carrying the"
329,OUT OF SEASON,fishing rods unjointed one in each hand. Peduzzi didn’t like her to
330,OUT OF SEASON,"be way back there. Signorina, he called, winking at the young"
331,OUT OF SEASON,"gentleman, come up here and walk with us. Signora come up here. Let"
332,OUT OF SEASON,us all walk together. Peduzzi wanted them all three to walk down the
333,OUT OF SEASON,street of Cortina together.
334,OUT OF SEASON,
335,OUT OF SEASON,"The wife stayed behind, following rather sullenly. Signorina, Peduzzi"
336,OUT OF SEASON,"called tenderly, come up here with us. The young gentleman looked"
337,OUT OF SEASON,"back and shouted something. The wife stopped lagging behind, and"
338,OUT OF SEASON,walked up.
339,OUT OF SEASON,
340,OUT OF SEASON,Everyone they met walking through the main street of the town Peduzzi
341,OUT OF SEASON,greeted elaborately. _Buon’ di Arturo!_ Tipping his hat. The bank
342,OUT OF SEASON,clerk stared at him from the door of the Fascist café. Groups of
343,OUT OF SEASON,three and four people standing in front of the shops stared at the
344,OUT OF SEASON,three. The workmen in their stone-powdered jackets working on the
345,OUT OF SEASON,foundations of the new hotel looked up as they passed. Nobody spoke
346,OUT OF SEASON,"or gave any sign to them except the town beggar, lean and old with a"
347,OUT OF SEASON,"spittle thickened beard, who lifted his hat as they passed."
348,OUT OF SEASON,
349,OUT OF SEASON,Peduzzi stopped in front of a store with the window full of bottles
350,OUT OF SEASON,and brought his empty grappa bottle from an inside pocket of his old
351,OUT OF SEASON,"military coat. A little to drink, some marsala for the Signora,"
352,OUT OF SEASON,"something, something to drink. He gestured with the bottle. It was a"
353,OUT OF SEASON,"wonderful day. Marsala, you like marsala, Signorina? A little"
354,OUT OF SEASON,marsala?
355,OUT OF SEASON,
356,OUT OF SEASON,"The wife stood sullenly. You’ll have to play up to this, she said. I"
357,OUT OF SEASON,can’t understand a word he says. He’s drunk isn’t he?
358,OUT OF SEASON,
359,OUT OF SEASON,The young gentleman appeared not to hear Peduzzi. He was thinking
360,OUT OF SEASON,what in hell makes him say Marsala. That’s what Max Beerbohm drinks.
361,OUT OF SEASON,
362,OUT OF SEASON,"_Geld,_ Peduzzi said finally, taking hold of the young gentleman’s"
363,OUT OF SEASON,sleeve. _Lire._ He smiled reluctant to press the subject but needing
364,OUT OF SEASON,to bring the young gentleman into action.
365,OUT OF SEASON,
366,OUT OF SEASON,The young gentleman took out his pocket book and gave him a ten lire
367,OUT OF SEASON,note. Peduzzi went up the steps to the door of the Speciality of
368,OUT OF SEASON,Domestic and Foreign Wines shop. It was locked.
369,OUT OF SEASON,
370,OUT OF SEASON,"It is closed until two, someone passing in the street said"
371,OUT OF SEASON,"scornfully. Peduzzi came down the steps. He felt hurt. Never mind, he"
372,OUT OF SEASON,"said, we can get it at the Concordia."
373,OUT OF SEASON,
374,OUT OF SEASON,They walked down the road to the Concordia three abreast. On the
375,OUT OF SEASON,porch of the Concordia where the rusty bobsleds were stacked the
376,OUT OF SEASON,"young gentleman said, _Was wollen sie?_ Peduzzi handed him the ten"
377,OUT OF SEASON,"lira note folded over and over. Nothing, he said, Anything. He was"
378,OUT OF SEASON,embarrassed. Marsala maybe. I don’t know. Marsala?
379,OUT OF SEASON,
380,OUT OF SEASON,The door of the Concordia shut on the young gentleman and the wife.
381,OUT OF SEASON,"Three marsalas, said the y. g. to the girl behind the pastry counter."
382,OUT OF SEASON,"Two you mean? she asked. No, he said, one for a _vecchio._ Oh, she"
383,OUT OF SEASON,"said, a _vecchio,_ and laughed getting down the bottle. She poured"
384,OUT OF SEASON,out the three muddy looking drinks into three glasses. The wife was
385,OUT OF SEASON,sitting at a table under the line of newspapers on sticks. The y. g.
386,OUT OF SEASON,"put one of the marsalas in front of her. You might as well drink it,"
387,OUT OF SEASON,he said. Maybe it’ll make you feel better. She sat and looked at the
388,OUT OF SEASON,glass. The y. g. went outside the door with a glass for Peduzzi but
389,OUT OF SEASON,could not see him.
390,OUT OF SEASON,
391,OUT OF SEASON,"I don’t know where he is, he said coming back into the pastry room"
392,OUT OF SEASON,carrying the glass.
393,OUT OF SEASON,
394,OUT OF SEASON,"He wanted a quart of it, said the wife."
395,OUT OF SEASON,
396,OUT OF SEASON,"How much is a quarter litre, the y. g. asked the girl."
397,OUT OF SEASON,
398,OUT OF SEASON,Of the bianco? One lira.
399,OUT OF SEASON,
400,OUT OF SEASON,"No, of the marsala. Put these two in too, he said giving her his own"
401,OUT OF SEASON,glass and the one poured for Peduzzi. She filled the quarter litre
402,OUT OF SEASON,"wine measure with a funnel. A bottle to carry it, said the y. g."
403,OUT OF SEASON,
404,OUT OF SEASON,She went to hunt for a bottle. It all amused her.
405,OUT OF SEASON,
406,OUT OF SEASON,"I’m sorry you feel so rotten Tiny, he said, I’m sorry I talked the"
407,OUT OF SEASON,way I did at lunch. We were both getting at the same thing from
408,OUT OF SEASON,different angles.
409,OUT OF SEASON,
410,OUT OF SEASON,"It doesn’t make any difference, she said. None of it makes any"
411,OUT OF SEASON,difference.
412,OUT OF SEASON,
413,OUT OF SEASON,"Are you too cold, he asked. I wish you’d worn another sweater."
414,OUT OF SEASON,
415,OUT OF SEASON,I’ve got on three sweaters.
416,OUT OF SEASON,
417,OUT OF SEASON,The girl came in with a very slim brown bottle and poured the marsala
418,OUT OF SEASON,into it. The y. g. paid five lira more. They went out of the door.
419,OUT OF SEASON,The girl was amused. Peduzzi was walking up and down at the other end
420,OUT OF SEASON,out of the wind and holding the rods.
421,OUT OF SEASON,
422,OUT OF SEASON,"Come on, he said, I will carry the rods. What difference does it make"
423,OUT OF SEASON,if anybody sees them. No one will trouble us. No one will make any
424,OUT OF SEASON,trouble for me in Cortina. I know them at the _municipio._ I have
425,OUT OF SEASON,been a soldier. Everybody in this town likes me. I sell frogs. What
426,OUT OF SEASON,if it is forbidden to fish? Not a thing. Nothing. No trouble. Big
427,OUT OF SEASON,trout I tell you. Lots of them.
428,OUT OF SEASON,
429,OUT OF SEASON,They were walking down the hill toward the river. The town was in
430,OUT OF SEASON,back of them. The sun had gone under and it was sprinkling rain.
431,OUT OF SEASON,"There, said Peduzzi, pointing to a girl in the doorway of a house"
432,OUT OF SEASON,they passed. My daughter.
433,OUT OF SEASON,
434,OUT OF SEASON,"His doctor, the wife said, has he got to show us his doctor?"
435,OUT OF SEASON,
436,OUT OF SEASON,"He said his daughter, said the y. g."
437,OUT OF SEASON,
438,OUT OF SEASON,The girl went into the house as Peduzzi pointed.
439,OUT OF SEASON,
440,OUT OF SEASON,They walked down the hill across the fields and then turned to follow
441,OUT OF SEASON,the river bank. Peduzzi talked rapidly with much winking and
442,OUT OF SEASON,knowingness. As they walked three abreast the wife caught his breath
443,OUT OF SEASON,across the wind. Once he nudged her in the ribs. Part of the time he
444,OUT OF SEASON,talked in D’Ampezzo dialect and sometimes in Tyroler German dialect.
445,OUT OF SEASON,He could not make out which the young gentleman and his wife
446,OUT OF SEASON,understood the best so he was being bi-lingual. But as the young
447,OUT OF SEASON,gentleman said _Ja Ja_ Peduzzi decided to talk altogether in Tyroler.
448,OUT OF SEASON,The young gentleman and the wife understood nothing.
449,OUT OF SEASON,
450,OUT OF SEASON,Everybody in the town saw us going through with these rods. We’re
451,OUT OF SEASON,probably being followed by the game police now. I wish we weren’t in
452,OUT OF SEASON,on this damn thing. This damned old fool is so drunk too.
453,OUT OF SEASON,
454,OUT OF SEASON,"Of course you haven’t got the guts to just go back, said the wife. Of"
455,OUT OF SEASON,course you have to go on.
456,OUT OF SEASON,
457,OUT OF SEASON,Why don’t you go back? Go on back Tiny.
458,OUT OF SEASON,
459,OUT OF SEASON,I’m going to stay with you. If you go to jail we might as well both
460,OUT OF SEASON,go.
461,OUT OF SEASON,
462,OUT OF SEASON,They turned sharp down the bank and Peduzzi stood his coat blowing in
463,OUT OF SEASON,the wind gesturing at the river. It was brown and muddy. Off on the
464,OUT OF SEASON,right there was a dump heap.
465,OUT OF SEASON,
466,OUT OF SEASON,"Say it to me in Italian, said the young gentleman"
467,OUT OF SEASON,
468,OUT OF SEASON,_Un’ mezz’ ora. Piu d’ un’ mezz’ ora._
469,OUT OF SEASON,
470,OUT OF SEASON,He says it’s at least a half an hour more. Go on back Tiny. You’re
471,OUT OF SEASON,cold in this wind anyway. It’s a rotten day and we aren’t going to
472,OUT OF SEASON,have any fun anyway.
473,OUT OF SEASON,
474,OUT OF SEASON,"All right, she said, and climbed up the grassy bank."
475,OUT OF SEASON,
476,OUT OF SEASON,Peduzzi was down at the river and did not notice her till she was
477,OUT OF SEASON,almost out of sight over the crest. Frau! he shouted. Frau! Fraulein!
478,OUT OF SEASON,You’re not going? She went on over the crest of the hill.
479,OUT OF SEASON,
480,OUT OF SEASON,She’s gone! said Peduzzi. It shocked him.
481,OUT OF SEASON,
482,OUT OF SEASON,He took off the rubber bands that held the rod segments together and
483,OUT OF SEASON,commenced to joint up one of the rods.
484,OUT OF SEASON,
485,OUT OF SEASON,But you said it was half an hour further.
486,OUT OF SEASON,
487,OUT OF SEASON,Oh yes. It is good half an hour down. It is good here too.
488,OUT OF SEASON,
489,OUT OF SEASON,Really?
490,OUT OF SEASON,
491,OUT OF SEASON,Of course. It is good here and good there too.
492,OUT OF SEASON,
493,OUT OF SEASON,"The y. g. sat down on the bank and jointed up a rod, put on the reel"
494,OUT OF SEASON,and threaded the line through the guides. He felt uncomfortable and
495,OUT OF SEASON,afraid that any minute a gamekeeper or a posse of citizens would come
496,OUT OF SEASON,over the bank from the town. He could see the houses of the town and
497,OUT OF SEASON,the campanile over the edge of the hill. He opened his leader box.
498,OUT OF SEASON,Peduzzi leaned over and dug his flat hard thumb and forefinger in and
499,OUT OF SEASON,tangled the moistened leaders.
500,OUT OF SEASON,
501,OUT OF SEASON,Have you some lead?
502,OUT OF SEASON,
503,OUT OF SEASON,No.
504,OUT OF SEASON,
505,OUT OF SEASON,You must have some lead. Peduzzi was excited. You must have _piombo.
506,OUT OF SEASON,Piombo._ A little _piombo._ Just here. Just above the hook or your
507,OUT OF SEASON,bait will float on the water. You must have it. Just a little
508,OUT OF SEASON,_piombo._
509,OUT OF SEASON,
510,OUT OF SEASON,Have you got some?
511,OUT OF SEASON,
512,OUT OF SEASON,No. He looked through all his pockets desperately. Sifting through
513,OUT OF SEASON,the cloth dirt in the linings of his inside military pockets. I
514,OUT OF SEASON,haven’t any. We must have _piombo._
515,OUT OF SEASON,
516,OUT OF SEASON,"We can’t fish then, said the y. g. and unjointed the rod, reeling the"
517,OUT OF SEASON,line back through the guides. We’ll get some _piombo_ and fish
518,OUT OF SEASON,tomorrow.
519,OUT OF SEASON,
520,OUT OF SEASON,"But listen _caro,_ you must have _piombo._ The line will lie flat on"
521,OUT OF SEASON,the water. Peduzzi’s day was going to pieces before his eyes. You
522,OUT OF SEASON,must have _piombo._ A little is enough. Your stuff is all clean and
523,OUT OF SEASON,new but you have no lead. I would have brought some. You said you had
524,OUT OF SEASON,everything.
525,OUT OF SEASON,
526,OUT OF SEASON,The y. g. looked at the stream discoloured by the melting snow. I
527,OUT OF SEASON,"know, he said, we’ll get some _piombo_ and fish tomorrow."
528,OUT OF SEASON,
529,OUT OF SEASON,At what hour in the morning? Tell me that.
530,OUT OF SEASON,
531,OUT OF SEASON,At seven.
532,OUT OF SEASON,
533,OUT OF SEASON,The sun came out. It was warm and pleasant. The young gentleman felt
534,OUT OF SEASON,relieved. He was no longer breaking the law. Sitting on the bank he
535,OUT OF SEASON,took the bottle of marsala out of his pocket and passed it to
536,OUT OF SEASON,Peduzzi. Peduzzi passed it back. The y. g. took a drink of it and
537,OUT OF SEASON,"passed it to Peduzzi again. Peduzzi passed it back again. Drink, he"
538,OUT OF SEASON,"said, drink. It’s your marsala. After another short drink the y. g."
539,OUT OF SEASON,handed the bottle over. Peduzzi had been watching it closely. He took
540,OUT OF SEASON,the bottle very hurriedly and tipped it up. The grey hairs in the
541,OUT OF SEASON,folds of his neck oscillated as he drank his eyes fixed on the end of
542,OUT OF SEASON,the narrow brown bottle. He drank it all. The sun shone while he
543,OUT OF SEASON,drank. It was wonderful. This was a great day after all. A wonderful
544,OUT OF SEASON,day.
545,OUT OF SEASON,
546,OUT OF SEASON,_Senta caro!_ In the morning at seven. He had called the young
547,OUT OF SEASON,gentleman _caro_ several times and nothing had happened. It was good
548,OUT OF SEASON,marsala. His eyes glistened. Days like this stretched out ahead. It
549,OUT OF SEASON,would begin again at seven in the morning.
550,OUT OF SEASON,
551,OUT OF SEASON,They started to walk up the hill toward the town. The y. g. went on
552,OUT OF SEASON,ahead. He was quite a way up the hill. Peduzzi called to him.
553,OUT OF SEASON,
554,OUT OF SEASON,Listen _caro_ can you let me take five lira for a favour?
555,OUT OF SEASON,
556,OUT OF SEASON,For today? asked the young gentleman frowning.
557,OUT OF SEASON,
558,OUT OF SEASON,"No, not today. Give it to me today for tomorrow. I will provide"
559,OUT OF SEASON,"everything for tomorrow. _Pane, salami, formaggio,_ good stuff for"
560,OUT OF SEASON,"all of us. You and I and the signora. Bait for fishing, minnows, not"
561,OUT OF SEASON,worms only. Perhaps I can get some marsala. All for five lira. Five
562,OUT OF SEASON,lira for a favour.
563,OUT OF SEASON,
564,OUT OF SEASON,The young gentleman looked through his pocket book and took out a two
565,OUT OF SEASON,lira note and two ones.
566,OUT OF SEASON,
567,OUT OF SEASON,"Thank you _caro_. Thank you, said Peduzzi in the tone of one member"
568,OUT OF SEASON,of the Carleton Club accepting the Morning Post from another. This
569,OUT OF SEASON,"was living. He was through with the hotel garden, breaking up frozen"
570,OUT OF SEASON,manure with a dung fork. Life was opening out.
571,OUT OF SEASON,
572,OUT OF SEASON,"Until seven o’clock then _caro,_ he said, slapping the y. g. on the"
573,OUT OF SEASON,back. Promptly at seven.
574,OUT OF SEASON,
575,OUT OF SEASON,"I may not be going, said the young gentleman putting his purse back"
576,OUT OF SEASON,in his pocket.
577,OUT OF SEASON,
578,OUT OF SEASON,"What, said Peduzzi. I will have minnows Signor. _Salami,_ everything."
579,OUT OF SEASON,You and I and the Signora. The three of us.
580,OUT OF SEASON,
581,OUT OF SEASON,"I may not be going, said the y. g., very probably not. I will leave"
582,OUT OF SEASON,word with the padrone at the hotel office.
583,OUT OF SEASON,
584,OUT OF SEASON,
585,OUT OF SEASON,
586,OUT OF SEASON,
587,MY OLD MAN,MY OLD MAN
588,MY OLD MAN,
589,MY OLD MAN,
590,MY OLD MAN,MY OLD MAN
591,MY OLD MAN,
592,MY OLD MAN,
593,MY OLD MAN,"I guess looking at it now my old man was cut out for a fat guy, one"
594,MY OLD MAN,"of those regular little roly fat guys you see around, but he sure"
595,MY OLD MAN,"never got that way, except a little toward the last, and then it"
596,MY OLD MAN,"wasn’t his fault, he was riding over the jumps only and he could"
597,MY OLD MAN,afford to carry plenty of weight then. I remember the way he’d pull
598,MY OLD MAN,on a rubber shirt over a couple of jerseys and a big sweat shirt over
599,MY OLD MAN,that and get me to run with him in the forenoon in the hot sun. He’d
600,MY OLD MAN,have maybe taken a trial trip with one of Razzo’s skins early in the
601,MY OLD MAN,morning after just getting in from Torino at four o’clock in the
602,MY OLD MAN,morning and beating it out to the stables in a cab and then with the
603,MY OLD MAN,dew all over everything and the sun just starting to get going I’d
604,MY OLD MAN,help him pull off his boots and he’d get into a pair of sneakers and
605,MY OLD MAN,all these sweaters and we’d start out.
606,MY OLD MAN,
607,MY OLD MAN,"“Come on kid” he’d say, stepping up and down on his toes in front of"
608,MY OLD MAN,"the jock’s dressing room, “let’s get moving”."
609,MY OLD MAN,
610,MY OLD MAN,Then we’d start off jogging around the infield once maybe with him
611,MY OLD MAN,ahead running nice and then turn out the gate and along one of those
612,MY OLD MAN,roads with all the trees along both sides of them that run out from
613,MY OLD MAN,San Siro. I’d go ahead of him when we hit the road and I could run
614,MY OLD MAN,pretty stout and I’d look around and he’d be jogging easy just behind
615,MY OLD MAN,me and after a little while I’d look around again and he’d begun to
616,MY OLD MAN,sweat. Sweating heavy and he’d just be dogging it along with his eyes
617,MY OLD MAN,"on my back, but when he’d catch me looking at him he’d grin and say,"
618,MY OLD MAN,“Sweating plenty?” When my old man grinned nobody could help but grin
619,MY OLD MAN,too. We’d keep right on running out toward the mountains and then my
620,MY OLD MAN,old man would yell “Hey Joe!” and I’d look back and he’d be sitting
621,MY OLD MAN,under a tree with a towel he’d had around his waist wrapped around
622,MY OLD MAN,his neck.
623,MY OLD MAN,
624,MY OLD MAN,I’d come back and sit down beside him and he’d pull a rope out of his
625,MY OLD MAN,pocket and start skipping rope out in the sun with the sweat pouring
626,MY OLD MAN,off his face and him skipping rope out in the white dust with the
627,MY OLD MAN,rope going cloppetty cloppety clop clop clop and the sun hotter and
628,MY OLD MAN,him working harder up and down a patch of the road. Say it was a
629,MY OLD MAN,treat to see my old man skip rope too. He could whirr it fast or lop
630,MY OLD MAN,it slow and fancy. Say you ought to have seen wops look at us
631,MY OLD MAN,sometimes when they’d come by going into town walking along with big
632,MY OLD MAN,white steers hauling the cart. They sure looked as though they
633,MY OLD MAN,thought the old man was nuts. He’d start the rope whirring till
634,MY OLD MAN,"they’d stop dead still and watch him, then give the steers a cluck"
635,MY OLD MAN,and a poke with the goad and get going again.
636,MY OLD MAN,
637,MY OLD MAN,When I’d sit watching him working out in the hot sun I sure felt fond
638,MY OLD MAN,of him. He sure was fun and he done his work so hard and he’d finish
639,MY OLD MAN,up with a regular whirring that’d drive the sweat out on his face
640,MY OLD MAN,like water and then sling the rope at the tree and come over and sit
641,MY OLD MAN,down with me and lean back against the tree with the towel and a
642,MY OLD MAN,sweater wrapped around his neck.
643,MY OLD MAN,
644,MY OLD MAN,"“Sure is hell keeping it down, Joe” he’d say and lean back and shut"
645,MY OLD MAN,"his eyes and breath long and deep, “it aint like when you’re a kid”."
646,MY OLD MAN,Then he’d get up before he started to cool and we’d jog along back to
647,MY OLD MAN,the stables. That’s the way it was keeping down to weight. He was
648,MY OLD MAN,worried all the time. Most jocks can just about ride off all they
649,MY OLD MAN,"want to. A jock loses about a kilo every time he rides, but my old"
650,MY OLD MAN,man was sort of dried out and he couldn’t keep down his kilos without
651,MY OLD MAN,all that running.
652,MY OLD MAN,
653,MY OLD MAN,"I remember once at San Siro, Regoli, a little wop that was riding for"
654,MY OLD MAN,Buzoni came out across the paddock going to the bar for something
655,MY OLD MAN,"cool and flicking his boots with his whip, after he’d just weighed in"
656,MY OLD MAN,and my old man had just weighed in too and came out with the saddle
657,MY OLD MAN,under his arm looking red faced and tired and too big for his silks
658,MY OLD MAN,and he stood there looking at young Regoli standing up to the
659,MY OLD MAN,"outdoors bar cool and kid looking and I says, “What’s the matter"
660,MY OLD MAN,Dad?” cause I thought maybe Regoli had bumped him or something and he
661,MY OLD MAN,"just looked at Regoli and said, “Oh to hell with it” and went on to"
662,MY OLD MAN,the dressing room.
663,MY OLD MAN,
664,MY OLD MAN,Well it would have been all right maybe if we’d stayed in Milan and
665,MY OLD MAN,ridden at Milan and Torino cause if there ever were any easy courses
666,MY OLD MAN,"its those two. “Pianola, Joe”. My old man said when he dismounted in"
667,MY OLD MAN,the winning stall after what the wops thought was a hell of a
668,MY OLD MAN,"steeplechase. I asked him once, “This course rides its-self. It’s the"
669,MY OLD MAN,pace you’re going at that makes riding the jumps dangerous Joe. We
670,MY OLD MAN,"aint going any pace here, and they aint any really bad jumps either."
671,MY OLD MAN,But it’s the pace always—not the jumps that makes the trouble”.
672,MY OLD MAN,
673,MY OLD MAN,San Siro was the swellest course I’d ever seen but the old man said
674,MY OLD MAN,it was a dog’s life. Going back and forth between Mirafiore and San
675,MY OLD MAN,Siro and riding just about every day in the week with a train ride
676,MY OLD MAN,every other night.
677,MY OLD MAN,
678,MY OLD MAN,I was nuts about the horses too. There’s something about it when they
679,MY OLD MAN,come out and go up the track to the post. Sort of dancy and tight
680,MY OLD MAN,looking with the jock keeping a tight hold on them and maybe easing
681,MY OLD MAN,off a little and letting them run a little going up. Then once they
682,MY OLD MAN,were at the barrier it got me worse than anything. Especially at San
683,MY OLD MAN,Siro with that big green infield and the mountains way off and the
684,MY OLD MAN,fat wop starter with his big whip and the jocks fiddling them around
685,MY OLD MAN,and then the barrier snapping up and that bell going off and them all
686,MY OLD MAN,getting off in a bunch and then commencing to string out. You know
687,MY OLD MAN,the way a bunch of skins gets off. If you’re up in the stand with a
688,MY OLD MAN,pair of glasses all you see is them plunging off and then that bell
689,MY OLD MAN,goes off and it seems like it rings for a thousand years and then
690,MY OLD MAN,they come sweeping round the turn. There wasn’t ever anything like it
691,MY OLD MAN,for me.
692,MY OLD MAN,
693,MY OLD MAN,But my old man said one day in the dressing room when he was getting
694,MY OLD MAN,"into his street clothes, “None of these things are horses Joe. They’d"
695,MY OLD MAN,kill that bunch of skates for their hides and hoofs up at Paris”.
696,MY OLD MAN,That was the day he’d won the Premio Commercio with Lantorna shooting
697,MY OLD MAN,her out of the field the last hundred meters like pulling a cork out
698,MY OLD MAN,of a bottle.
699,MY OLD MAN,
700,MY OLD MAN,It was right after the Premio Commercio that we pulled out and left
701,MY OLD MAN,Italy. My old man and Holbrook and a fat wop in a straw hat that kept
702,MY OLD MAN,wiping his face with a handkerchief were having an argument at a
703,MY OLD MAN,table in the Galleria. They were all talking French and the two of
704,MY OLD MAN,them were after my old man about something. Finally he didn’t say
705,MY OLD MAN,anything any more but just sat there and looked at Holbrook and the
706,MY OLD MAN,"two of them kept after him, first one talking and then the other and"
707,MY OLD MAN,the fat wop always butting in on Holbrook.
708,MY OLD MAN,
709,MY OLD MAN,"“You go out and buy me a Sportsman, will you Joe?” my old man said"
710,MY OLD MAN,and handed me a couple of _soldi_ without looking away from Holbrook.
711,MY OLD MAN,
712,MY OLD MAN,So I went out of the Galleria and walked over to in front of the
713,MY OLD MAN,Scala and bought a paper and came back and stood a little way away
714,MY OLD MAN,because I didn’t want to butt in and my old man was sitting back in
715,MY OLD MAN,his chair looking down at his coffee and fooling with a spoon and
716,MY OLD MAN,Holbrook and the big wop were standing and the big wop was wiping his
717,MY OLD MAN,face and shaking his head. And I came up and my old man acted just as
718,MY OLD MAN,"though the two of them weren’t standing there and said, “Want an ice"
719,MY OLD MAN,"Joe?” Holbrook looked down at my old man and said slow and careful,"
720,MY OLD MAN,“You son of a bitch” and he and the fat wop went out through the
721,MY OLD MAN,tables.
722,MY OLD MAN,
723,MY OLD MAN,My old man sat there and sort of smiled at me but his face was white
724,MY OLD MAN,and he looked sick as hell and I was scared and felt sick inside
725,MY OLD MAN,because I knew something had happened and I didn’t see how anybody
726,MY OLD MAN,could call my old man a son of a bitch and get away with it. My old
727,MY OLD MAN,man opened up the Sportsman and studied the handicaps for a while and
728,MY OLD MAN,"then he said, “You got to take a lot of things in this world Joe”."
729,MY OLD MAN,And three days later we left Milan for good on the Turin train for
730,MY OLD MAN,Paris after an auction sale out in front of Turner’s stables of
731,MY OLD MAN,everything we couldn’t get into a trunk and a suit case.
732,MY OLD MAN,
733,MY OLD MAN,We got into Paris early in the morning in a long dirty station the
734,MY OLD MAN,old man told me was the Gare de Lyon. Paris was an awful big town
735,MY OLD MAN,after Milan. Seems like in Milan everybody is going somewhere and all
736,MY OLD MAN,"the trams run somewhere and there aint any sort of a mixup, but Paris"
737,MY OLD MAN,is all balled up and they never do straighten it out. I got to like
738,MY OLD MAN,"it though, part of it anyway, and say it’s got the best race courses"
739,MY OLD MAN,in the world. Seems as though that were the thing that keeps it all
740,MY OLD MAN,going and about the only thing you can figure on is that every day
741,MY OLD MAN,the buses will be going out to whatever track they’re running at
742,MY OLD MAN,going right out through everything to the track. I never really got
743,MY OLD MAN,to know Paris well because I just came in about once or twice a week
744,MY OLD MAN,with the old man from Maisons and he always sat at the Cafe de la
745,MY OLD MAN,Paix on the Opera side with the rest of the gang from Maisons and I
746,MY OLD MAN,guess that’s one of the busiest parts of the town. But say it is
747,MY OLD MAN,funny that a big town like Paris wouldn’t have a Galleria isn’t it?
748,MY OLD MAN,
749,MY OLD MAN,"Well, we went out to live at Maisons-Lafitte, where just about"
750,MY OLD MAN,"everybody lives except the gang at Chantilly, with a Mrs. Meyers that"
751,MY OLD MAN,runs a boarding house. Maisons is about the swellest place to live
752,MY OLD MAN,"I’ve ever seen in all my life. The town aint so much, but there’s a"
753,MY OLD MAN,"lake and a swell forest that we used to go off bumming in all day, a"
754,MY OLD MAN,"couple of us kids, and my old man made me a sling shot and we got a"
755,MY OLD MAN,lot of things with it but the best one was a magpie. Young Dick
756,MY OLD MAN,Atkinson shot a rabbit with it one day and we put it under a tree and
757,MY OLD MAN,were all sitting around and Dick had some cigarettes and all of a
758,MY OLD MAN,sudden the rabbit jumped up and beat it into the brush and we chased
759,MY OLD MAN,it but we couldn’t find it. Gee we had fun at Maisons. Mrs. Meyers
760,MY OLD MAN,used to give me lunch in the morning and I’d be gone all day. I
761,MY OLD MAN,learned to talk French quick. It’s an easy language.
762,MY OLD MAN,
763,MY OLD MAN,As soon as we got to Maisons my old man wrote to Milan for his
764,MY OLD MAN,license and he was pretty worried till it came. He used to sit around
765,MY OLD MAN,"the Cafe de Paris in Maisons with the gang there, there were lots of"
766,MY OLD MAN,guys he’d known when he rode up at Paris before the war lived at
767,MY OLD MAN,"Maisons, and there’s a lot of time to sit around because the work"
768,MY OLD MAN,"around a racing stable for the jocks that is, is all cleaned up by"
769,MY OLD MAN,nine o’clock in the morning. They take the first batch of skins out
770,MY OLD MAN,to gallop them at 5.30 in the morning and they work the second lot at
771,MY OLD MAN,8 o’clock. That means getting up early all right and going to bed
772,MY OLD MAN,early too. If a jock’s riding for somebody too he can’t go boozing
773,MY OLD MAN,around because the trainer always has an eye on him if he’s a kid and
774,MY OLD MAN,if he aint a kid he’s always got an eye on himself. So mostly if a
775,MY OLD MAN,jock aint working he sits around the Café de Paris with the gang and
776,MY OLD MAN,they can all sit around about two or three hours in front of some
777,MY OLD MAN,drink like a vermouth and seltz and they talk and tell stories and
778,MY OLD MAN,shoot pool and it’s sort of like a club or the Galleria in Milan.
779,MY OLD MAN,Only it aint really like the Galleria because there everybody is
780,MY OLD MAN,going by all the time and there’s everybody around at the tables.
781,MY OLD MAN,
782,MY OLD MAN,Well my old man got his license all right. They sent it through to
783,MY OLD MAN,"him without a word and he rode a couple of times. Amiens, up country"
784,MY OLD MAN,"and that sort of thing, but he didn’t seem to get any engagement."
785,MY OLD MAN,Everybody liked him and whenever I’d come in to the Café in the
786,MY OLD MAN,forenoon I’d find somebody drinking with him because my old man
787,MY OLD MAN,wasn’t tight like most of these jockey’s that have got the first
788,MY OLD MAN,dollar they made riding at the World’s Fair in St. Louis in Nineteen
789,MY OLD MAN,ought four. That’s what my old man would say when he’d kid George
790,MY OLD MAN,Burns. But it seemed like everybody steered clear of giving my old
791,MY OLD MAN,man any mounts.
792,MY OLD MAN,
793,MY OLD MAN,We went out to wherever they were running every day with the car from
794,MY OLD MAN,Maisons and that was the most fun of all. I was glad when the horses
795,MY OLD MAN,came back from Deauville and the summer. Even though it meant no more
796,MY OLD MAN,"bumming in the woods, cause then we’d ride to Enghien or Tremblay or"
797,MY OLD MAN,St. Cloud and watch them from the trainers’ and jockeys’ stand. I
798,MY OLD MAN,sure learned about racing from going out with that gang and the fun
799,MY OLD MAN,of it was going every day.
800,MY OLD MAN,
801,MY OLD MAN,I remember once out at St. Cloud. It was a big two hundred thousand
802,MY OLD MAN,franc race with seven entries and Kzar a big favourite. I went around
803,MY OLD MAN,to the paddock to see the horses with my old man and you never saw
804,MY OLD MAN,such horses. This Kzar is a great big yellow horse that looks like
805,MY OLD MAN,just nothing but run. I never saw such a horse. He was being led
806,MY OLD MAN,around the paddock with his head down and when he went by me I felt
807,MY OLD MAN,all hollow inside he was so beautiful. There never was such a
808,MY OLD MAN,"wonderful, lean, running built horse. And he went around the paddock"
809,MY OLD MAN,putting his feet just so and quiet and careful and moving easy like
810,MY OLD MAN,he knew just what he had to do and not jerking and standing up on his
811,MY OLD MAN,legs and getting wild eyed like you see these selling platers with a
812,MY OLD MAN,shot of dope in them. The crowd was so thick I couldn’t see him again
813,MY OLD MAN,except just his legs going by and some yellow and my old man started
814,MY OLD MAN,out through the crowd and I followed him over to the jock’s dressing
815,MY OLD MAN,room back in the trees and there was a big crowd around there too but
816,MY OLD MAN,the man at the door in a derby nodded to my old man and we got in and
817,MY OLD MAN,everybody was sitting around and getting dressed and pulling shirts
818,MY OLD MAN,over their heads and pulling boots on and it all smelled hot and
819,MY OLD MAN,sweaty and linimenty and outside was the crowd looking in.
820,MY OLD MAN,
821,MY OLD MAN,The old man went over and sat down beside George Gardner that was
822,MY OLD MAN,"getting into his pants and said, “What’s the dope George?” just in an"
823,MY OLD MAN,ordinary tone of voice cause there aint any use him feeling around
824,MY OLD MAN,because George either can tell him or he can’t tell him.
825,MY OLD MAN,
826,MY OLD MAN,"“He won’t win” George says very low, leaning over and buttoning the"
827,MY OLD MAN,bottoms of his pants.
828,MY OLD MAN,
829,MY OLD MAN,“Who will” my old man says leaning over close so nobody can hear.
830,MY OLD MAN,
831,MY OLD MAN,"“Kircubbin” George says, “And if he does, save me a couple of"
832,MY OLD MAN,tickets”.
833,MY OLD MAN,
834,MY OLD MAN,My old man says something in a regular voice to George and George
835,MY OLD MAN,"says, “Don’t ever bet on anything I tell you” kidding like and we"
836,MY OLD MAN,beat it out and through all the crowd that was looking in over to the
837,MY OLD MAN,100 franc mutuel machine. But I knew something big was up because
838,MY OLD MAN,George is Kzar’s jockey. On the way he gets one of the yellow odds
839,MY OLD MAN,"sheets with the starting prices on and Kzar is only paying 5 for 10,"
840,MY OLD MAN,Cefisidote is next at 3 to I and fifth down the list this Kircubbin
841,MY OLD MAN,at 8 to 1. My old man bets five thousand on Kircubbin to win and puts
842,MY OLD MAN,on a thousand to place and we went around back of the grandstand to
843,MY OLD MAN,go up the stairs and get a place to watch the race.
844,MY OLD MAN,
845,MY OLD MAN,We were jammed in tight and first a man in a long coat with a grey
846,MY OLD MAN,tall hat and a whip folded up in his hand came out and then one after
847,MY OLD MAN,"another the horses, with the jocks up and a stable boy holding the"
848,MY OLD MAN,"bridle on each side and walking along, followed the old guy. That big"
849,MY OLD MAN,yellow horse Kzar came first. He didn’t look so big when you first
850,MY OLD MAN,looked at him until you saw the length of his legs and the whole way
851,MY OLD MAN,he’s built and the way he moves. Gosh I never saw such a horse.
852,MY OLD MAN,"George Gardner was riding him and they moved along slow, back of the"
853,MY OLD MAN,old guy in the gray tall hat that walked along like he was the ring
854,MY OLD MAN,"master in a circus. Back of Kzar, moving along smooth and yellow in"
855,MY OLD MAN,"the sun, was a good looking black with a nice head with Tommy"
856,MY OLD MAN,Archibald riding him and after the black was a string of five more
857,MY OLD MAN,horses all moving along slow in a procession past the grandstand and
858,MY OLD MAN,the pesage. My old man said the black was Kircubbin and I took a good
859,MY OLD MAN,look at him and he was a nice looking horse all right but nothing
860,MY OLD MAN,like Kzar.
861,MY OLD MAN,
862,MY OLD MAN,Everybody cheered Kzar when he went by and he sure was one swell
863,MY OLD MAN,looking horse. The procession of them went around on the other side
864,MY OLD MAN,past the pelouse and then back up to the near end of the course and
865,MY OLD MAN,the circus master had the stable boys turn them loose one after
866,MY OLD MAN,another so they could gallop by the stands on their way up to the
867,MY OLD MAN,post and let everybody have a good look at them. They weren’t at the
868,MY OLD MAN,post hardly any time at all when the gong started and you could see
869,MY OLD MAN,them way off across the infield all in a bunch starting on the first
870,MY OLD MAN,swing like a lot of little toy horses. I was watching them through
871,MY OLD MAN,the glasses and Kzar was running well back with one of the bays
872,MY OLD MAN,making the pace. They swept down and around and came pounding past
873,MY OLD MAN,and Kzar was way back when they passed us and this Kircubbin horse in
874,MY OLD MAN,front and going smooth. Gee it’s awful when they go by you and then
875,MY OLD MAN,you have to watch them go farther away and get smaller and smaller
876,MY OLD MAN,and then all bunched up on the turns and then come around towards
877,MY OLD MAN,into the stretch and you feel like swearing and goddaming worse and
878,MY OLD MAN,worse. Finally they made the last turn and came into the straightaway
879,MY OLD MAN,with this Kircubbin horse way out in front. Everybody was looking
880,MY OLD MAN,funny and saying “Kzar” in sort of a sick way and they pounding
881,MY OLD MAN,"nearer down the stretch, and then something came out of the pack"
882,MY OLD MAN,right into my glasses like a horse-headed yellow streak and everybody
883,MY OLD MAN,began to yell “Kzar” as though they were crazy. Kzar came on faster
884,MY OLD MAN,than I’d ever seen anything in my life and pulled up on Kircubbin
885,MY OLD MAN,that was going fast as any black horse could go with the jock
886,MY OLD MAN,flogging hell out of him with the gad and they were right dead neck
887,MY OLD MAN,and neck for a second but Kzar seemed going about twice as fast with
888,MY OLD MAN,those great jumps and that head out—but it was while they were neck
889,MY OLD MAN,and neck that they passed the winning post and when the numbers went
890,MY OLD MAN,up in the slots the first one was 2 and that meant Kircubbin had won.
891,MY OLD MAN,
892,MY OLD MAN,"I felt all trembly and funny inside, and then we were all jammed in"
893,MY OLD MAN,with the people going down stairs to stand in front of the board
894,MY OLD MAN,where they’d post what Kircubbin paid. Honest watching the race I’d
895,MY OLD MAN,forgot how much my old man had bet on Kircubbin. I’d wanted Kzar to
896,MY OLD MAN,win so damned bad. But now it was all over it was swell to know we
897,MY OLD MAN,had the winner.
898,MY OLD MAN,
899,MY OLD MAN,“Wasn’t it a swell race Dad?” I said to him.
900,MY OLD MAN,
901,MY OLD MAN,"He looked at me sort of funny with his derby on the back of his head,"
902,MY OLD MAN,"“George Gardner’s a swell jockey all right”, he said, “It sure took a"
903,MY OLD MAN,great jock to keep that Kzar horse from winning”.
904,MY OLD MAN,
905,MY OLD MAN,Of course I knew it was funny all the time. But my old man saying
906,MY OLD MAN,that right out like that sure took the kick all out of it for me and
907,MY OLD MAN,"I didn’t get the real kick back again ever, even when they posted the"
908,MY OLD MAN,numbers up on the board and the bell rang to pay off and we saw that
909,MY OLD MAN,Kircubbin paid 67.50 for 10. All around people were saying “Poor
910,MY OLD MAN,"Kzar. Poor Kzar!” And I thought, I wish I were a jockey and could"
911,MY OLD MAN,"have rode him instead of that son of a bitch. And that was funny,"
912,MY OLD MAN,thinking of George Gardner as a son of a bitch because I’d always
913,MY OLD MAN,"liked him and besides he’d given us the winner, but I guess that’s"
914,MY OLD MAN,what he is all right.
915,MY OLD MAN,
916,MY OLD MAN,My old man had a big lot of money after that race and he took to
917,MY OLD MAN,coming into Paris oftener. If they raced at Tremblay he’d have them
918,MY OLD MAN,drop him in town on their way back to Maisons and he and I’d sit out
919,MY OLD MAN,in front of the Café de la Paix and watch the people go by. It’s
920,MY OLD MAN,funny sitting there. There’s streams of people going by and all sorts
921,MY OLD MAN,of guys come up and want to sell you things and I loved to sit there
922,MY OLD MAN,with my old man. That was when we’d have the most fun. Guys would
923,MY OLD MAN,come by selling funny rabbits that jumped if you squeezed a bulb and
924,MY OLD MAN,they’d come up to us and my old man would kid with them. He could
925,MY OLD MAN,talk French just like English and all those kind of guys knew him
926,MY OLD MAN,cause you can always tell a jockey—and then we always sat at the same
927,MY OLD MAN,table and they got used to seeing us there. There were guys selling
928,MY OLD MAN,matrimonial papers and girls selling rubber eggs that when you
929,MY OLD MAN,squeezed them a rooster came out of them and one old wormy looking
930,MY OLD MAN,"guy that went by with post cards of Paris showing them to everybody,"
931,MY OLD MAN,and of course nobody ever bought any and then he would come back and
932,MY OLD MAN,show the under side of the pack and they would all be smutty post
933,MY OLD MAN,cards and lots of people would dig down and buy them.
934,MY OLD MAN,
935,MY OLD MAN,Gee I remember the funny people that used to go by. Girls around
936,MY OLD MAN,supper time looking for somebody to take them out to eat and they’d
937,MY OLD MAN,speak to my old man and he’d make some joke at them in French and
938,MY OLD MAN,they’d pat me on the head and go on. Once there was an American woman
939,MY OLD MAN,sitting with her kid daughter at the next table to us and they were
940,MY OLD MAN,both eating ices and I kept looking at the girl and she was awfully
941,MY OLD MAN,good looking and I smiled at her and she smiled at me but that was
942,MY OLD MAN,all that ever came of it because I looked for her mother and her
943,MY OLD MAN,every day and I made up ways that I was going to speak to her and I
944,MY OLD MAN,wondered if I got to know her if her mother would let me take her out
945,MY OLD MAN,to Auteuil or Tremblay but I never saw either of them again. Anyway I
946,MY OLD MAN,guess it wouldn’t have been any good anyway because looking back on
947,MY OLD MAN,it I remember the way I thought out would be best to speak to her was
948,MY OLD MAN,"to say, “Pardon me, but perhaps I can give you a winner at Enghien"
949,MY OLD MAN,today?” and after all maybe she would have thought I was a tout
950,MY OLD MAN,instead of really trying to give her a winner.
951,MY OLD MAN,
952,MY OLD MAN,"We’d sit at the Café de la Paix, my old man and me, and we had a big"
953,MY OLD MAN,drag with the waiter because my old man drank whisky and it cost five
954,MY OLD MAN,francs and that meant a good tip when the saucers were counted up. My
955,MY OLD MAN,"old man was drinking more than I’d ever seen him, but he wasn’t"
956,MY OLD MAN,riding at all now and besides he said that whiskey kept his weight
957,MY OLD MAN,down. But I noticed he was putting it on all right just the same.
958,MY OLD MAN,He’d busted away from his old gang out at Maisons and seemed to like
959,MY OLD MAN,just sitting around on the boulevard with me. But he was dropping
960,MY OLD MAN,money every day at the track. He’d feel sort of doleful after the
961,MY OLD MAN,"last race, if he’d lost on the day, until we’d get to our table and"
962,MY OLD MAN,he’d have his first whiskey and then he’d be fine.
963,MY OLD MAN,
964,MY OLD MAN,"He’d be reading the Paris-Sport and he’d look over at me and say,"
965,MY OLD MAN,“Where’s your girl Joe?” to kid me on account I had told him about
966,MY OLD MAN,the girl that day at the next table. And I’d get red but I liked
967,MY OLD MAN,being kidded about her. It gave me a good feeling. “Keep your eye
968,MY OLD MAN,"peeled for her Joe.” he’d say, “She’ll be back.”"
969,MY OLD MAN,
970,MY OLD MAN,He’d ask me questions about things and some of the things I’d say
971,MY OLD MAN,he’d laugh. And then he’d get started talking about things. About
972,MY OLD MAN,"riding down in Egypt, or at St. Moritz on the ice before my mother"
973,MY OLD MAN,"died, and about during the war when they had regular races down in"
974,MY OLD MAN,"the south of France without any purses, or betting or crowd or"
975,MY OLD MAN,anything just to keep the breed up. Regular races with the jocks
976,MY OLD MAN,riding hell out of the horses. Gee I could listen to my old man talk
977,MY OLD MAN,"by the hour, especially when he’d had a couple or so of drinks. He’d"
978,MY OLD MAN,tell me about when he was a boy in Kentucky and going coon hunting
979,MY OLD MAN,and the old days in the states before everything went on the bum
980,MY OLD MAN,"there. And he’d say, “Joe, when we’ve got a decent stake, you’re"
981,MY OLD MAN,going back there to the States and go to school.”
982,MY OLD MAN,
983,MY OLD MAN,“What’ve I got to go back there to go to school for when everything’s
984,MY OLD MAN,on the bum there?” I’d ask him.
985,MY OLD MAN,
986,MY OLD MAN,“That’s different.” he’d say and get the waiter over and pay the pile
987,MY OLD MAN,of saucers and we’d get a taxi to the Gare St. Lazare and get on the
988,MY OLD MAN,train out to Maisons.
989,MY OLD MAN,
990,MY OLD MAN,One day at Auteuil after a selling steeplechase my old man bought in
991,MY OLD MAN,the winner for 30.000 francs. He had to bid a little to get him but
992,MY OLD MAN,the stable let the horse go finally and my old man had his permit and
993,MY OLD MAN,his colors in a week. Gee I felt proud when my old man was an owner.
994,MY OLD MAN,He fixed it up for stable space with Charles Drake and cut out coming
995,MY OLD MAN,in to Paris and started his running and sweating out again and him
996,MY OLD MAN,"and I were the whole stable gang. Our horse’s name was Gillford, he"
997,MY OLD MAN,was Irish bred and a nice sweet jumper. My old man figured that
998,MY OLD MAN,training him and riding him himself he was a good investment. I was
999,MY OLD MAN,proud of everything and I thought Gillford was as good a horse as
1000,MY OLD MAN,"Kzar. He was a good solid jumper a bay, with plenty of speed on the"
1001,MY OLD MAN,flat if you asked him for it and he was a nice looking horse too.
1002,MY OLD MAN,
1003,MY OLD MAN,Gee I was fond of him. The first time he started with my old man up
1004,MY OLD MAN,he finished third in a 2.500 meter hurdle race and when my old man
1005,MY OLD MAN,"got off him, all sweating and happy in the place stall and went in to"
1006,MY OLD MAN,weigh I felt as proud of him as though it was the first race he’d
1007,MY OLD MAN,ever placed in. You see when a guy aint been riding for a long time
1008,MY OLD MAN,you can’t make yourself really believe that he has ever rode. The
1009,MY OLD MAN,whole thing was different now cause down in Milan even big races
1010,MY OLD MAN,"never seemed to make any difference to my old man, if he won he"
1011,MY OLD MAN,"wasn’t ever excited or anything, and now it was so I couldn’t hardly"
1012,MY OLD MAN,sleep the night before a race and I knew my old man was excited too
1013,MY OLD MAN,even if he didn’t show it. Riding for yourself makes an awful
1014,MY OLD MAN,difference.
1015,MY OLD MAN,
1016,MY OLD MAN,Second time Gillford and my old man started was a rainy Sunday at
1017,MY OLD MAN,"Auteuil in the Prix du Marat, a 4.500 meter steeplechase. As soon as"
1018,MY OLD MAN,he’d gone out I beat it up in the stand with the new glasses my old
1019,MY OLD MAN,man had bought for me to watch them. They started way over at the far
1020,MY OLD MAN,end of the course and there was some trouble at the barrier.
1021,MY OLD MAN,Something with goggle blinders on was making a great fuss and rearing
1022,MY OLD MAN,around and busted the barrier once but I could see my old man in our
1023,MY OLD MAN,black jacket with a white cross and a black cap sitting up on
1024,MY OLD MAN,Gillford and patting him with his hand. Then they were off in a jump
1025,MY OLD MAN,and out of sight behind the trees and the gong going for dear life
1026,MY OLD MAN,and the pari mutuel wickets rattling down. Gosh I was so excited I
1027,MY OLD MAN,was afraid to look at them but I fixed the glasses on the place where
1028,MY OLD MAN,they would come out back of the trees and then out they came with the
1029,MY OLD MAN,old black jacket going third and they all sailing over the jump like
1030,MY OLD MAN,birds. Then they went out of sight again and then they came pounding
1031,MY OLD MAN,out and down the hill and all going nice and sweet and easy and
1032,MY OLD MAN,taking the fence smooth in a bunch and moving away from us all solid.
1033,MY OLD MAN,Looked as though you could walk across on their backs they were all
1034,MY OLD MAN,"so bunched and going so smooth, Then they bellied over the big double"
1035,MY OLD MAN,Bullfinch and something came down. I couldn’t see who it was but in a
1036,MY OLD MAN,"minute the horse was up an galloping free and the field, all bunched"
1037,MY OLD MAN,"still, sweeping around the long left turn into the straightaway. They"
1038,MY OLD MAN,jumped the stone wall and came jammed down the stretch toward the big
1039,MY OLD MAN,water jump right in front of the stands. I saw them coming and
1040,MY OLD MAN,hollered at my old man as he went by and he was leading by about a
1041,MY OLD MAN,length and riding way out over and light as a monkey and they were
1042,MY OLD MAN,racing for the water jump. They took off over the big hedge of the
1043,MY OLD MAN,water jump in a pack and then there was a crash and two horses pulled
1044,MY OLD MAN,sideways out off it and kept on going and three others were piled up.
1045,MY OLD MAN,I couldn’t see my old man anywhere. One horse knee-ed himself up and
1046,MY OLD MAN,the jock had hold of the bridle and mounted and went slamming on
1047,MY OLD MAN,"after the place money. The other horse was up and away by himself,"
1048,MY OLD MAN,jerking his head and galloping with the bridle rein hanging and the
1049,MY OLD MAN,jock staggered over to one side of the track against the fence. Then
1050,MY OLD MAN,Gillford rolled over to one side off my old man and got up and
1051,MY OLD MAN,started to run on three legs with his off hoof dangling and there was
1052,MY OLD MAN,my old man lying there on the grass flat out with his face up and
1053,MY OLD MAN,blood all over the side of his head. I ran down the stand and bumped
1054,MY OLD MAN,into a jam of people and got to the rail and a cop grabbed me and
1055,MY OLD MAN,held me and two big stretcher bearers were going out after my old man
1056,MY OLD MAN,"and around on the other side of the course I saw three horses, strung"
1057,MY OLD MAN,"way out, coming out of the trees and taking the jump."
1058,MY OLD MAN,
1059,MY OLD MAN,My old man was dead when they brought him in and while a doctor was
1060,MY OLD MAN,listening to his heart with a thing plugged in his ears I heard a
1061,MY OLD MAN,shot up the track that meant they’d killed Gillford. I lay down
1062,MY OLD MAN,beside my old man when they carried the stretcher into the hospital
1063,MY OLD MAN,room and hung onto the stretcher and cried and cried and he looked so
1064,MY OLD MAN,white and gone and so awfully dead and I couldn’t help feeling that
1065,MY OLD MAN,if my old man was dead maybe they didn’t need to have shot Gillford.
1066,MY OLD MAN,His hoof might have got well. I don’t know. I loved my old man so
1067,MY OLD MAN,much.
1068,MY OLD MAN,
1069,MY OLD MAN,Then a couple of guys came in and one of them patted me on the back
1070,MY OLD MAN,and then went over and looked at my old man and then pulled a sheet
1071,MY OLD MAN,off the cot and and spread it over him; and the other was telephoning
1072,MY OLD MAN,in French for them to send the ambulance to take him out to Maisons.
1073,MY OLD MAN,"And I couldn’t stop crying, crying and choking, sort of, and George"
1074,MY OLD MAN,Gardner came in and sat down beside me on the floor and put his arm
1075,MY OLD MAN,"around me and says, “Come on Joe old boy. Get up and we’ll go out and"
1076,MY OLD MAN,wait for the ambulance.”
1077,MY OLD MAN,
1078,MY OLD MAN,George and I went out to the gate and I was trying to stop bawling
1079,MY OLD MAN,and George wiped off my face with his handkerchief and we were
1080,MY OLD MAN,standing back a little ways while the crowd was going out of the gate
1081,MY OLD MAN,and a couple of guys stopped near us while we were waiting for the
1082,MY OLD MAN,crowd to get through the gate and one of them was counting a bunch of
1083,MY OLD MAN,"mutuel tickets and he said, “Well Butler got his all right.”"
1084,MY OLD MAN,
1085,MY OLD MAN,"The other guy said, “I don’t give a good goddam if he did, the crook."
1086,MY OLD MAN,He had it coming to him on the stuff he’s pulled.”
1087,MY OLD MAN,
1088,MY OLD MAN,"“I’ll say he had,” said the other guy and tore the bunch of tickets"
1089,MY OLD MAN,in two.
1090,MY OLD MAN,
1091,MY OLD MAN,And George Gardner looked at me to see if I’d heard and I had all
1092,MY OLD MAN,"right and he said, “Don’t you listen to what those bums said Joe."
1093,MY OLD MAN,Your old man was one swell guy.”
1094,MY OLD MAN,
1095,MY OLD MAN,But I don’t know. Seems like when they get started they dont leave a
1096,MY OLD MAN,guy nothing.
