2022,SAPPHO,"more than any bright lover,"
2023,SAPPHO,I vowed
2024,SAPPHO,to the innermost
2025,SAPPHO,"god of the temple,"
2026,SAPPHO,this vow.
2027,SAPPHO,
2028,SAPPHO,"God of beauty, I cried,"
2029,SAPPHO,"as the four stood alert,"
2030,SAPPHO,awaiting the shout
2031,SAPPHO,at the goal
2032,SAPPHO,to be off;
2033,SAPPHO,"god of beauty,"
2034,SAPPHO,"I cried to that god,"
2035,SAPPHO,"if he merit the laurel,"
2036,SAPPHO,I dedicate all of my soul
2037,SAPPHO,to you; to you
2038,SAPPHO,all my strength and my power;
2039,SAPPHO,"if he merit the bay,"
2040,SAPPHO,I will fashion a statue
2041,SAPPHO,"of him, of my brother,"
2042,SAPPHO,"out of thought,"
2043,SAPPHO,and the strength of my wrist
2044,SAPPHO,and the fire of my brain;
2045,SAPPHO,I will strive night and day
2046,SAPPHO,"till I mould from the clay,"
2047,SAPPHO,"till I strike from the bronze,"
2048,SAPPHO,"till I conjure the rock,"
2049,SAPPHO,"the chisle, the tool,"
2050,SAPPHO,to embody this image;
2051,SAPPHO,"an image to startle,"
2052,SAPPHO,"to capture men’s hearts,"
2053,SAPPHO,"to make all other bronze,"
2054,SAPPHO,"all art to come after,"
2055,SAPPHO,"a mock,"
2056,SAPPHO,"all beauty to follow,"
2057,SAPPHO,a shell that is empty;
2058,SAPPHO,I’ll stake all my soul
2059,SAPPHO,"on that beauty,"
2060,SAPPHO,till God shall awake
2061,SAPPHO,"again in men’s hearts,"
2062,SAPPHO,"who have said he is dead,"
2063,SAPPHO,our King and our Lover.
2064,SAPPHO,
2065,SAPPHO,"Then the start,"
2066,SAPPHO,"ah the sight,"
2067,SAPPHO,"ah but dim, veiled with tears,"
2068,SAPPHO,(so Achilles must weep
2069,SAPPHO,"who finds his friend dead,)"
2070,SAPPHO,will he win?
2071,SAPPHO,then the ring of the steel
2072,SAPPHO,"as two met at the goal,"
2073,SAPPHO,"entangled and foul,"
2074,SAPPHO,"misplaced at the start,"
2075,SAPPHO,"who, who blunders? not you?"
2076,SAPPHO,what omens are set?
2077,SAPPHO,"alas, gods of the track,"
2078,SAPPHO,"what ill wreaks its hate,"
2079,SAPPHO,"speak it clear,"
2080,SAPPHO,let me know
2081,SAPPHO,"what evil, what fate?"
2082,SAPPHO,for the ring of sharp steel
2083,SAPPHO,"told two were in peril,"
2084,SAPPHO,"two, two, one is you,"
2085,SAPPHO,already involved
2086,SAPPHO,with the fears of defeat;
2087,SAPPHO,two grazed;
2088,SAPPHO,which must go?
2089,SAPPHO,
2090,SAPPHO,"As the wind,"
2091,SAPPHO,Althaia’s beauty came;
2092,SAPPHO,"as one after a cruel march,"
2093,SAPPHO,"catches sight,"
2094,SAPPHO,"toward the cold dusk,"
2095,SAPPHO,of the flower
2096,SAPPHO,"that’s her name-sake,"
2097,SAPPHO,strayed apart
2098,SAPPHO,"toward the road-dust,"
2099,SAPPHO,from the stream
2100,SAPPHO,"in the wood-depth,"
2101,SAPPHO,"so I in that darkness,"
2102,SAPPHO,my mouth bitter
2103,SAPPHO,"with sheer loss,"
2104,SAPPHO,"took courage,"
2105,SAPPHO,"my heart spoke,"
2106,SAPPHO,remembering how she spoke:
2107,SAPPHO,“I will seek hour by hour
2108,SAPPHO,"fresh cones, resin"
2109,SAPPHO,"and pine-flowers,"
2110,SAPPHO,"flower of pine,"
2111,SAPPHO,laurel flower;
2112,SAPPHO,I will pray:
2113,SAPPHO,‘let him come
2114,SAPPHO,"back to us,"
2115,SAPPHO,"to our home,"
2116,SAPPHO,"with the trophy of zeal,"
2117,SAPPHO,with the love and the proof
2118,SAPPHO,of the favour of god;
2119,SAPPHO,let him merit the bay.’
2120,SAPPHO,"(I expect it,)"
2121,SAPPHO,I myself on earth pray
2122,SAPPHO,that our father may pray;
2123,SAPPHO,his voice nearer the gods
2124,SAPPHO,must carry beyond
2125,SAPPHO,my mere mortal prayer:
2126,SAPPHO,"‘O my father beyond,"
2127,SAPPHO,"look down and be proud,"
2128,SAPPHO,ask this thing
2129,SAPPHO,"that we win,"
2130,SAPPHO,ask it straight of the gods.’”
2131,SAPPHO,
2132,SAPPHO,"Was he glad,"
2133,SAPPHO,did he know?
2134,SAPPHO,for the strength
2135,SAPPHO,of his prayer and her prayer
2136,SAPPHO,met me now
2137,SAPPHO,"in one flame,"
2138,SAPPHO,"all my head, all my brow"
2139,SAPPHO,"was one flame,"
2140,SAPPHO,taut and beaten
2141,SAPPHO,"and faintly aglow,"
2142,SAPPHO,as the wine-cup
2143,SAPPHO,encrusted and beaten and fine
2144,SAPPHO,"with the pattern of leaves,"
2145,SAPPHO,"(so my brow,)"
2146,SAPPHO,"yet metallic and cool,"
2147,SAPPHO,as the gold of the frigid metal
2148,SAPPHO,that circles the heat
2149,SAPPHO,of the wine.
2150,SAPPHO,
2151,SAPPHO,"Then the axel-tree cleft,"
2152,SAPPHO,"not ours, gods be blest;"
2153,SAPPHO,"now but three of you left,"
2154,SAPPHO,"three alert and abreast,"
2155,SAPPHO,three--one streak of what fire?
2156,SAPPHO,three straight for the goal:
2157,SAPPHO,"ah defeat,"
2158,SAPPHO,"ah despair,"
2159,SAPPHO,"still fate tricked our mares,"
2160,SAPPHO,"for they swerved,"
2161,SAPPHO,"flanks quivering and wet,"
2162,SAPPHO,as the wind
2163,SAPPHO,at the mid-stretch
2164,SAPPHO,caught and fluttered a white scarf;
2165,SAPPHO,"a veil shivering,"
2166,SAPPHO,only the fluttering
2167,SAPPHO,"of a white band,"
2168,SAPPHO,"yet unnerved and champing,"
2169,SAPPHO,"they turned,"
2170,SAPPHO,(only knowing the swards of Achæa)
2171,SAPPHO,"and he, O my love,"
2172,SAPPHO,"that stranger,"
2173,SAPPHO,his stallions
2174,SAPPHO,"stark frenzied and black,"
2175,SAPPHO,"had taken the inmost course,"
2176,SAPPHO,"overtook,"
2177,SAPPHO,"overcame,"
2178,SAPPHO,"overleapt,"
2179,SAPPHO,and crowded you back.
2180,SAPPHO,
2181,SAPPHO,O those horses
2182,SAPPHO,we loved and we prized;
2183,SAPPHO,I had gathered Alea mint
2184,SAPPHO,and soft branch
2185,SAPPHO,"of the vine-stock in flower,"
2186,SAPPHO,I had stroked Elaphia;
2187,SAPPHO,as one prays to a woman
2188,SAPPHO,"“be kind,”"
2189,SAPPHO,I had prayed Daphnaia;
2190,SAPPHO,I had threatened Orea
2191,SAPPHO,for her trick
2192,SAPPHO,"of out-pacing the three,"
2193,SAPPHO,"even these,"
2194,SAPPHO,I had almost despaired
2195,SAPPHO,"at her fleet, proud pace,"
2196,SAPPHO,"O the four,"
2197,SAPPHO,O swift mares of Achæa.
2198,SAPPHO,
2199,SAPPHO,Should I pray them again?
2200,SAPPHO,or the gods of the track?
2201,SAPPHO,or Althaia at home?
2202,SAPPHO,or our father who died for Achæa?
2203,SAPPHO,or our fathers beyond
2204,SAPPHO,who had vanquished the east?
2205,SAPPHO,should I threaten or pray?
2206,SAPPHO,
2207,SAPPHO,The sun struck the ridge of white marble
2208,SAPPHO,before me:
2209,SAPPHO,white sun on white marble
2210,SAPPHO,was black:
2211,SAPPHO,"the day was of ash,"
2212,SAPPHO,"blind, unrepentant, despoiled,"
2213,SAPPHO,"my soul cursed the race and the track,"
2214,SAPPHO,you had lost.
2215,SAPPHO,
2216,SAPPHO,"_You_, lost at the last?"
2217,SAPPHO,
2218,SAPPHO,"Ah fools,"
2219,SAPPHO,so you threatened to win?
2220,SAPPHO,"ah fools,"
2221,SAPPHO,so you knew my brother?
2222,SAPPHO,
2223,SAPPHO,"Greeks all,"
2224,SAPPHO,"all crafty and feckless,"
2225,SAPPHO,"even so, had you guessed"
2226,SAPPHO,"what ran in his veins and mine,"
2227,SAPPHO,"what blood of Achæa,"
2228,SAPPHO,"had you dared,"
2229,SAPPHO,"dared enter the contest,"
2230,SAPPHO,dared aspire with the rest?
2231,SAPPHO,
2232,SAPPHO,"You had gained,"
2233,SAPPHO,you outleapt them;
2234,SAPPHO,"a sudden, swift lift of the reins,"
2235,SAPPHO,"a sudden, swift, taut grip of the reins,"
2236,SAPPHO,"as suddenly loosed,"
2237,SAPPHO,you had gained.
2238,SAPPHO,
2239,SAPPHO,When death comes
2240,SAPPHO,I will see
2241,SAPPHO,"no vision of after,"
2242,SAPPHO,(as some count
2243,SAPPHO,"there may be an hereafter,)"
2244,SAPPHO,"no thought of old lover,"
2245,SAPPHO,"no girl, no woman,"
2246,SAPPHO,"neither mother,"
2247,SAPPHO,nor yet my father
2248,SAPPHO,"who died for Achæa,"
2249,SAPPHO,neither God with the harp
2250,SAPPHO,"and the sun on His brow,"
2251,SAPPHO,"but thou,"
2252,SAPPHO,O my brother.
2253,SAPPHO,
2254,SAPPHO,"When death comes,"
2255,SAPPHO,"instead of a vision,"
2256,SAPPHO,(I will catch it in bronze)
2257,SAPPHO,you will stand
2258,SAPPHO,"as you stood at the end,"
2259,SAPPHO,"(as the herald announced it,"
2260,SAPPHO,"proclaiming aloud,"
2261,SAPPHO,"“Achæa has won,”)"
2262,SAPPHO,"in-reining them now,"
2263,SAPPHO,"so quiet,"
2264,SAPPHO,not turning to answer
2265,SAPPHO,the shout of the crowd.
2266,SAPPHO,
2267,SAPPHO,
2268,SAPPHO,
2269,SAPPHO,
2270,SAPPHO,_The Look-out_
2271,SAPPHO,
2272,SAPPHO,
2273,SAPPHO,"Better the wind, the sea, the salt"
2274,SAPPHO,"in your eyes,"
2275,SAPPHO,"than this, this, this."
2276,SAPPHO,
2277,SAPPHO,You grumble and sweat;
2278,SAPPHO,my ears are acute
2279,SAPPHO,"to catch your complaint,"
2280,SAPPHO,almost the sea’s roar is less
2281,SAPPHO,than your constant threat
2282,SAPPHO,"of “back and back to the shore,"
2283,SAPPHO,and let us rest.”
2284,SAPPHO,
2285,SAPPHO,You grumble and curse your luck
2286,SAPPHO,and I hear:
2287,SAPPHO,"“O Lynceus,"
2288,SAPPHO,"aloft by the prow,"
2289,SAPPHO,"his head on his arms,"
2290,SAPPHO,"his eyes half closed,"
2291,SAPPHO,"almost asleep,"
2292,SAPPHO,"to watch for a rock,"
2293,SAPPHO,(and hardly ever we need
2294,SAPPHO,his ‘to left’ or ‘to right’)
2295,SAPPHO,"let Lynceus have my part,"
2296,SAPPHO,let me rest like Lynceus.”
2297,SAPPHO,
2298,SAPPHO,“Rest like Lynceus!”
2299,SAPPHO,"I’d change my fate for yours,"
2300,SAPPHO,"the very least,"
2301,SAPPHO,I’d take an oar with the rest.
2302,SAPPHO,
2303,SAPPHO,"“Like Lynceus,”"
2304,SAPPHO,as if my lot were the best.
2305,SAPPHO,
2306,SAPPHO,"O God, if I could speak,"
2307,SAPPHO,if I could taunt the lot
2308,SAPPHO,"of the wretched crew,"
2309,SAPPHO,"with my fate, my work."
2310,SAPPHO,
2311,SAPPHO,"But I may not,"
2312,SAPPHO,I may not tell
2313,SAPPHO,"of the forms that pass and pass,"
2314,SAPPHO,"of that constant old, old face"
2315,SAPPHO,that leaps from each wave
2316,SAPPHO,to wait underneath the boat
2317,SAPPHO,in the hope that at last she’s lost.
2318,SAPPHO,
2319,SAPPHO,"Could I speak,"
2320,SAPPHO,I would tell of great mountains
2321,SAPPHO,"that flow, great weeds"
2322,SAPPHO,that float and float
2323,SAPPHO,to tangle our oars
2324,SAPPHO,"if I fail “to left, to right;”"
2325,SAPPHO,where the dolphin leaps
2326,SAPPHO,"you saw a sign from the god,"
2327,SAPPHO,I saw why he leapt from the deep.
2328,SAPPHO,
2329,SAPPHO,"“To right, to left;”"
2330,SAPPHO,it is easy enough
2331,SAPPHO,"to lean on the prow, half asleep,"
2332,SAPPHO,"and you think,"
2333,SAPPHO,“no work for Lynceus.”
2334,SAPPHO,No work?
2335,SAPPHO,
2336,SAPPHO,"If only you’d let me take an oar,"
2337,SAPPHO,"if only my back could break with the hurt,"
2338,SAPPHO,"if the sun could blister my feet,"
2339,SAPPHO,"pain, pain that I might forget"
2340,SAPPHO,the face that just this moment
2341,SAPPHO,passed through the prow
2342,SAPPHO,"when you said, “asleep.”"
2343,SAPPHO,
2344,SAPPHO,Many and many a sight
2345,SAPPHO,"if I could speak,"
2346,SAPPHO,"many and many tales I’d tell,"
2347,SAPPHO,"many and many a struggle,"
2348,SAPPHO,"many a death,"
2349,SAPPHO,many and many my hurts
2350,SAPPHO,"and my pain so great,"
2351,SAPPHO,I’d gladly die
2352,SAPPHO,if I did not love the quest.
2353,SAPPHO,
2354,SAPPHO,"Grumble and swear and curse,"
2355,SAPPHO,"brother, god and the boat,"
2356,SAPPHO,"and the great waves,"
2357,SAPPHO,but could you guess
2358,SAPPHO,"what strange terror lurks in the sea-depth,"
2359,SAPPHO,"you’d thank the gods for the ship,"
2360,SAPPHO,"the timber and giant oars, god-like,"
2361,SAPPHO,and the god-like quest.
2362,SAPPHO,
2363,SAPPHO,"If you could see as I,"
2364,SAPPHO,"what lurks in the sea-depth,"
2365,SAPPHO,you’d pray to the ropes
2366,SAPPHO,and the solid timbers
2367,SAPPHO,"like god, like god;"
2368,SAPPHO,
2369,SAPPHO,"you’d pray to the oars and your work,"
2370,SAPPHO,you’d pray and thank
2371,SAPPHO,the boat for her very self;
2372,SAPPHO,timber and oar and plank
2373,SAPPHO,"and sail and the sail-ropes,"
2374,SAPPHO,these are beautiful things and great.
2375,SAPPHO,
2376,SAPPHO,But Lynceus at the prow
2377,SAPPHO,has nothing to do but wait
2378,SAPPHO,till we reach a shoal or some rocks
2379,SAPPHO,"and then he has only to lift his arms,"
2380,SAPPHO,"right, left;"
2381,SAPPHO,"O brother,"
2382,SAPPHO,I’d change my place
2383,SAPPHO,for the worst seat
2384,SAPPHO,"in the cramped bench,"
2385,SAPPHO,"for an oar, for an hour’s toil,"
2386,SAPPHO,for sweat and the solid floor.
2387,SAPPHO,
2388,SAPPHO,I’d change my place
2389,SAPPHO,"as I sit with eyes half closed,"
2390,SAPPHO,if only I could see just the ring
2391,SAPPHO,"cut by the boat,"
2392,SAPPHO,"if only I could see just the water,"
2393,SAPPHO,"the crest and the broken crest,"
2394,SAPPHO,"the bit of weed that rises on the crest,"
2395,SAPPHO,the dolphin only when he leaps.
2396,SAPPHO,
2397,SAPPHO,"But Lynceus,"
2398,SAPPHO,though they cannot guess
2399,SAPPHO,"the hurt, though they do not thank"
2400,SAPPHO,the oars for the dead peace
2401,SAPPHO,"of heart and brain worn out,"
2402,SAPPHO,"you must wait,"
2403,SAPPHO,"alert, alert, alert."

2415,SAPPHO,
2416,SAPPHO,
2417,SAPPHO,All the rest
2418,SAPPHO,"who had escaped death,"

2421,SAPPHO,"only Odysseus,"
2422,SAPPHO,"captive of a goddess,"
2423,SAPPHO,"desperate and home-sick,"
2424,SAPPHO,thought but of his wife and palace;

2426,SAPPHO,"that nymph and spirit,"
2427,SAPPHO,"yearning in the furrowed rock-shelf,"
2428,SAPPHO,burned
2429,SAPPHO,and sought to be his mistress;
2430,SAPPHO,"but years passed,"
2431,SAPPHO,"the time was ripe,"
2432,SAPPHO,"the gods decreed,"
2433,SAPPHO,(although traitors plot
2434,SAPPHO,"to betray him in his own court,)"
2435,SAPPHO,he was to return
2436,SAPPHO,to Ithaca;
2437,SAPPHO,and all the gods pitied him;
2438,SAPPHO,but Poseidon
2439,SAPPHO,steadfast to the last
2440,SAPPHO,hated
2441,SAPPHO,god-like Odysseus.
2442,SAPPHO,
2443,SAPPHO,The sea-god visited

2450,SAPPHO,there the hecatomb
2451,SAPPHO,of slain sheep and oxen
2452,SAPPHO,await his revels:
2453,SAPPHO,"and while he rejoiced,"
2454,SAPPHO,"seated at the feast,"
2455,SAPPHO,the rest of the gods
2456,SAPPHO,gathered in the palace of Olympian Zeus;
2457,SAPPHO,and the father of men and of gods spoke thus:
2458,SAPPHO,"(for he remembered bright Egisthus,"
2459,SAPPHO,"slain of Agamemnon’s child,"
2460,SAPPHO,great Orestes:)
2461,SAPPHO,
2462,SAPPHO,"O you spirits,"
2463,SAPPHO,"how men hate the gods,"
2464,SAPPHO,"for they say evil comes of us,"
2465,SAPPHO,"when they themselves,"
2466,SAPPHO,"by their own wickedness,"
2467,SAPPHO,court peril
2468,SAPPHO,beyond their fate;
2469,SAPPHO,"so Egisthus, defiant,"
2470,SAPPHO,sought Agamemnon’s wife
2471,SAPPHO,and slew Agamemnon
2472,SAPPHO,"returning to his own palace,"
2473,SAPPHO,though we ourselves
2474,SAPPHO,"sent bright Hermes,"
2475,SAPPHO,"slayer of Argos,"
2476,SAPPHO,to warn him
2477,SAPPHO,"lest Orestes,"
2478,SAPPHO,"attaining to man’s estate,"
2479,SAPPHO,demand his inheritance
2480,SAPPHO,and take vengeance:
2481,SAPPHO,"we forbade him to strike the king,"
2482,SAPPHO,we warned him to respect his wife:
2483,SAPPHO,but could Hermes
2484,SAPPHO,"of gracious aspect,"
2485,SAPPHO,"subtle with kindly speech,"
2486,SAPPHO,thus avert the foul work?
2487,SAPPHO,
2488,SAPPHO,"Then the grey-eyed Athene,"
2489,SAPPHO,"the goddess, spoke:"
2490,SAPPHO,"O my father, Kronos begot,"
2491,SAPPHO,"first among the great,"
2492,SAPPHO,"his death at least was just,"
2493,SAPPHO,so may all perish who err thus;

2528,SAPPHO,"O my child,"
2529,SAPPHO,what quaint words

2531,SAPPHO,for how could I forget
2532,SAPPHO,"the god-like Odysseus,"
2533,SAPPHO,"a spirit surpassing men,"
2534,SAPPHO,first to make sacrifice
2535,SAPPHO,to the deathless
2536,SAPPHO,in the sky-space?
2537,SAPPHO,but Poseidon
2538,SAPPHO,"girder of earth,"
2539,SAPPHO,"though yet he spares his life,"
2540,SAPPHO,nurtures unending hate;
2541,SAPPHO,he goads him from place to place
2542,SAPPHO,because of the Cyclops
2543,SAPPHO,"blinded of Odysseus,"
2544,SAPPHO,"Polyphemus, half-god,"
2545,SAPPHO,"greatest of the Cyclops,"
2546,SAPPHO,"whom the nymph Thoosa,"
2547,SAPPHO,"child of Phorcys,"
2548,SAPPHO,"king of the waste sea, begot"
2549,SAPPHO,when she lay with Poseidon
2550,SAPPHO,among the shallow rocks:
2551,SAPPHO,"but come,"
2552,SAPPHO,let us plot
2553,SAPPHO,"to reinstate Odysseus,"
2554,SAPPHO,and Poseidon must abandon his wrath;
2555,SAPPHO,"for what can one god accomplish,"
2556,SAPPHO,striving alone
2557,SAPPHO,to defy all the deathless?
2558,SAPPHO,
2559,SAPPHO,"Then the grey-eyed Athene,"
2560,SAPPHO,"the goddess, spoke:"
2561,SAPPHO,"O my father, Kronos begot,"
2562,SAPPHO,"first among the great,"
2563,SAPPHO,if then it seems just
2564,SAPPHO,"to the highest,"
2565,SAPPHO,that Odysseus return
2566,SAPPHO,"to his own house,"
2567,SAPPHO,let us swiftly send
2568,SAPPHO,"Hermes, slayer of Argos,"
2569,SAPPHO,"your attendant,"
2570,SAPPHO,that he state
2571,SAPPHO,"to the fair-haired nymph,"
2572,SAPPHO,"our irrevocable wish,"
2573,SAPPHO,"that Odysseus,"
2574,SAPPHO,"valiant of heart,"
2575,SAPPHO,be sent back:
2576,SAPPHO,"and I will depart to Ithaca,"
2577,SAPPHO,"to incite his son,"
2578,SAPPHO,"to put courage in his heart,"
2579,SAPPHO,that he call to the market place
2580,SAPPHO,the long-haired Greeks
2581,SAPPHO,and shut his gates
2582,SAPPHO,to the pretendants
2583,SAPPHO,"who ceaselessly devour his flocks,"
2584,SAPPHO,sheep and horned oxen
2585,SAPPHO,of gentle pace:
2586,SAPPHO,that he strive
2587,SAPPHO,for his father’s sake
2588,SAPPHO,and gain favour
2589,SAPPHO,"in men’s thoughts,"
2590,SAPPHO,"I will send him to Sparta,"
