306,INTRODUCTION,
307,INTRODUCTION,The modern idea seems to be that poetry has no relation to life. Life in
308,INTRODUCTION,"the modern sense is action, progress, success. Poetry has been conceded"
309,INTRODUCTION,"special themes: it can deal with passion,--the strange and unnatural and"
310,INTRODUCTION,"unreal physical attraction of the sexes--with nature, with the symbols"
311,INTRODUCTION,"of mythology, and with the characteristic sentimental heroism of history"
312,INTRODUCTION,"and events. With reality, it must have nothing to do. It is supposed, by"
313,INTRODUCTION,"the modern world of Anglo-Saxon literalness, to create an atmosphere of"
314,INTRODUCTION,"illusion, which one must avoid to keep one’s emotions from going astray"
315,INTRODUCTION,in a civilization that needs the hardest kind of common sense. It is
316,INTRODUCTION,paradoxical that the English-speaking people who have given the world
317,INTRODUCTION,"the greatest poets, should take this false attitude while in possession"
318,INTRODUCTION,"of the greatest spiritual and imaginative legacy of life and experience,"
319,INTRODUCTION,bequeathed them from one generation to another during the last four
320,INTRODUCTION,hundred years.
321,INTRODUCTION,
322,INTRODUCTION,"Escaping the illusion, this modern world has become the prisoner of"
323,INTRODUCTION,"delusion. For, if poetry deals with anything, it deals with reality. No"
324,INTRODUCTION,"matter how remote the setting, how subtle the communication, the one"
325,INTRODUCTION,"hard fact about true poetry, is its reality. The poet at the core and"
326,INTRODUCTION,"centre of life, surrounded with his dreams, his clairvoyant madness"
327,INTRODUCTION,"imbibed from the full draught of experience, his intensity of emotion,"
328,INTRODUCTION,"his childlike tenderness of sympathy, his quickening ecstasy of"
329,INTRODUCTION,"unashamed and unrestrained feeling, is considered the abnormal product"
330,INTRODUCTION,of modern civilization; while in truth he is alone the one normal type
331,INTRODUCTION,"of modern mankind, because he alone is in absolute harmony and"
332,INTRODUCTION,understanding with the real and common impulse of human destiny.
333,INTRODUCTION,
334,INTRODUCTION,"The great secret of life is to discover by a process of related effects,"
335,INTRODUCTION,this common reality of experience. Most of mankind grope blindly in the
336,INTRODUCTION,"dark, and miss it, and by a kind of frenzied and pitiable ignorance"
337,INTRODUCTION,"acquire the abnormal character of conduct. The poet discovers, or at"
338,INTRODUCTION,"least puts his being wholly at the disposal of, these secrets, wins a"
339,INTRODUCTION,"serene and contemplative relationship to these effects, and lives a"
340,INTRODUCTION,normal spiritual life. Harmony and rhythm are but two common terms that
341,INTRODUCTION,express and designate infinity. There was a man who was so absolutely
342,INTRODUCTION,sane that the scoffers of his day called him mad--this man was William
343,INTRODUCTION,"Blake. Christ was a madman to the community of his day, even his closest"
344,INTRODUCTION,friends and disciples were not without doubt at times as to his sanity.
345,INTRODUCTION,But these two men were never a hair’s breadth from the commonest reality
346,INTRODUCTION,"of existence. They realized imaginative facts, and kept in absolute tune"
347,INTRODUCTION,"with the harmony and rhythm of life, not merely with what they saw with"
348,INTRODUCTION,"the actual eye, but with that more penetrative, more limitless sense,"
349,INTRODUCTION,"the seeing soul. They were poets, and the one insistent quality of their"
350,INTRODUCTION,"message, was the reality of mortal and immortal life."
351,INTRODUCTION,
352,INTRODUCTION,It is hard to make a certain type of mind understand that all which is
353,INTRODUCTION,"seen with the physical eye, and touched with the fleshly hand, is"
354,INTRODUCTION,illusion. That kind of a mind does not understand symbols. It belongs
355,INTRODUCTION,"to the so-called practical people of the world, who obey, but do not"
356,INTRODUCTION,"comprehend, laws; whose laws, indeed, are the conventions of minds"
357,INTRODUCTION,"similar to their own. They organize, but do not construct; they"
358,INTRODUCTION,"interpret, but do not create. They are the wheels, and not the"
359,INTRODUCTION,"motor-power, of the engine of civilization and humanity. These are the"
360,INTRODUCTION,people who make up nine-tenths of the world’s population; without the
361,INTRODUCTION,"other tenth, they would perish. Their reality in life is mathematical"
362,INTRODUCTION,"immediacy, the cloak of visibility in which they are wrapped to go about"
363,INTRODUCTION,their daily tasks in the world. Now poetry sees in these people and
364,INTRODUCTION,"their affairs only the symbols of what is real, looks upon their whole"
365,INTRODUCTION,fantastic display of living as the illusion beneath which their real
366,INTRODUCTION,"living is concealed; the crises of their joys and sorrows, their"
367,INTRODUCTION,"aspirations and passions, hidden in the reality of their consciousness"
368,INTRODUCTION,"where exists an infinite universe of being, and where every event of"
369,INTRODUCTION,their lives is enacted before their shadow is thrown upon the stage of
370,INTRODUCTION,"the world. The fact of life is there, hidden away in the solitary soul,"
371,INTRODUCTION,determining the illusions of conductual existence. It is crowded with
372,INTRODUCTION,"moods, emotions and feelings, experienced with such intensity that what"
373,INTRODUCTION,breaks forth in actual deed and event is but a faint reflection of the
374,INTRODUCTION,"real experience the soul has gone through. The ideal is the real,"
375,INTRODUCTION,because it is what one has lived but cannot express in the related
376,INTRODUCTION,experience of human intercourse.
377,INTRODUCTION,
378,INTRODUCTION,Poetry comes nearer finality in embodying the exact meaning and
379,INTRODUCTION,"intensity of human feeling than any other art. Human feeling, being the"
380,INTRODUCTION,"root of all individual intelligence, is the most inexplicable quantity"
381,INTRODUCTION,in life. Intuition is the primary significance of our existence. And it
382,INTRODUCTION,is the quality which gives to poetry its visionary and spiritual
383,INTRODUCTION,substance. In a nation it is the register of a people’s culture.

387,INTRODUCTION,"The study of poetry in the magazines which I began ten years ago, has"
388,INTRODUCTION,grown into the convincing evidence of the following pages of this book.
389,INTRODUCTION,During this time we have passed through a number of phases in our
390,INTRODUCTION,national life; but through these changing aspects of national
391,INTRODUCTION,"aspirations, there has run, like a widening and brightening strand of"
392,INTRODUCTION,"culture, the development of a new period of poetry, both in its"
393,INTRODUCTION,"productive and appreciative aspects. From 1900 to 1905, poetry had"
394,INTRODUCTION,declined; and I think there has never been another period in our history
395,INTRODUCTION,when so unintelligent and indifferent an attitude existed toward the
396,INTRODUCTION,"art. The scale since 1905 has been ascending, and the high pitch of"
397,INTRODUCTION,achievement has not yet been reached. Whether fine poetry creates a
398,INTRODUCTION,"general and popular recognition of the art, or the sympathetic"
399,INTRODUCTION,"appreciation of poetry for itself encourages excellent production, I"
400,INTRODUCTION,cannot say. But this is apparent: that a period or epoch of the highest
401,INTRODUCTION,achievement has always been one of popular appreciation.
402,INTRODUCTION,
403,INTRODUCTION,"A factor that should be taken into consideration, and which affects"
404,INTRODUCTION,"poetry and its audience, is the attitude of the book reviews in our"
405,INTRODUCTION,most influential literary journals. A characteristic example is the New
406,INTRODUCTION,"York Nation, which has been in the habit of grouping in a few articles"
407,INTRODUCTION,"during the year with indiscriminate selection, the volumes of poetry"
408,INTRODUCTION,which it receives. In these reviews there is a supercilious and academic
409,INTRODUCTION,attitude which dismisses really important work with opinions which have
410,INTRODUCTION,every suggestion of preconceived judgment. One has only to turn back his
411,INTRODUCTION,files to the review of Masefield’s “Everlasting Mercy” and “The Widow in
412,INTRODUCTION,"the Bye Street,” to see the type of poetry reviewing that is more common"
413,INTRODUCTION,than uncommon in American periodicals and newspapers. I do not mean to
414,INTRODUCTION,"make The Nation an exception, but an illustration of the kind of"
415,INTRODUCTION,stewardship with which reviewers in some of our most authoritative
416,INTRODUCTION,publications perform the duties of a serious and distinguished branch of
417,INTRODUCTION,American authorship.
418,INTRODUCTION,
419,INTRODUCTION,To show that there is a quality of poetry in our national production
420,INTRODUCTION,"worthy of pride and support, it has been my privilege for a number of"
421,INTRODUCTION,years to emphasize in an annual review the distinction of the verse in
422,INTRODUCTION,the magazines. Out of these reviews has grown a demand for a more
423,INTRODUCTION,"permanent preservation of the best work, resulting in this annual"
424,INTRODUCTION,"“Anthology of Magazine Verse,” to which are added records, references,"
425,INTRODUCTION,"and criticisms, which constitute a “Year-Book of American Poetry.” While"
426,INTRODUCTION,"all the other arts have had this service performed in their interests,"
427,INTRODUCTION,"poetry, the one art that most needed such a special reinforcement of"
428,INTRODUCTION,"its achievement, has been permitted to drift along throughout our"
429,INTRODUCTION,entire critical history without this sort of attention.
430,INTRODUCTION,
431,INTRODUCTION,The poetry in the magazines this year has been of an excellence in the
432,INTRODUCTION,longer pieces beyond the standard of any year in which I have made these
433,INTRODUCTION,"estimates. The selections in this volume give evidence of a serious,"
434,INTRODUCTION,"even anxious, probing of human life. The lyric, represented by some"
435,INTRODUCTION,"lovely work, has not been practiced with the same irresponsible"
436,INTRODUCTION,"emotional delight as in past years. Perhaps, there has never been a year"
437,INTRODUCTION,when the American poets have shown the independence of their own
438,INTRODUCTION,"efforts, when comparatively new work has been so free from English"
439,INTRODUCTION,"influences. What influences there are, seem to come from French sources."
440,INTRODUCTION,_Vers libre_ has been taken out of the hands of weak and pompous
441,INTRODUCTION,"innovators, and made a distinctive medium by a few earnest and powerful"
442,INTRODUCTION,singers. The most notable distinction in this respect is to be found in
443,INTRODUCTION,"the work of James Oppenheim, whose book, “Songs for the New Age,” is a"
444,INTRODUCTION,milestone in our poetic progress. So is Vachel Lindsay’s new work. He
445,INTRODUCTION,has mastered a new form of poetic expression in his volume “The Congo
446,INTRODUCTION,"and Other Poems.” Miss Amy Lowell, in the better parts of “Sword Blades"
447,INTRODUCTION,"and Poppy Seed,” is working toward a new elasticity in rhythm, which is"
448,INTRODUCTION,beginning to produce effective and beautiful results. On the other hand
449,INTRODUCTION,Mr. Arthur Stringer in “Open Water” utterly fails to embody in actual
450,INTRODUCTION,performance the principles expounded in the introduction to that
451,INTRODUCTION,"volume, though this introduction is as important a piece of critical"
452,INTRODUCTION,writing in English upon the subject as I know. No matter how
453,INTRODUCTION,"revolutionary they attempt to be in expression, there is still in these"
454,INTRODUCTION,writers a traditional note imbuing the substance which makes up the
455,INTRODUCTION,significant part of their creativeness.
456,INTRODUCTION,
457,INTRODUCTION,The selections in this volume are chosen from all kinds and methods of
458,INTRODUCTION,"poetic expression, and the reader’s attention is invited to their"
459,INTRODUCTION,"differences in many aspects--though the aspect of quality is, I think,"
460,INTRODUCTION,of equal attainment in all--of such poems as Bliss Carman’s Phi Beta
461,INTRODUCTION,"Kappa Poem, Percy MacKaye’s “Fight,” Vachel Lindsay’s “The Firemen’s"
462,INTRODUCTION,"Ball,” Eloise Briton’s “The Two Flames,” Conrad Aiken’s “Romance,” Olive"
463,INTRODUCTION,"Tilford Dargan’s “Old Fairingdown” and “Path Flower,” Joyce Kilmer’s"
464,INTRODUCTION,"“Twelve-Forty-Five,” and Don Marquis’s “The God-Maker, Man.” Of the"
465,INTRODUCTION,"shorter pieces, I think the standard is decidedly above last year’s"
466,INTRODUCTION,quality. Mahlon Leonard Fisher has again followed the success of
467,INTRODUCTION,"previous years with his sonnet “Afterwards,” which sustains his position"
468,INTRODUCTION,as one of the foremost sonnet-writers this country has yet produced.
469,INTRODUCTION,This poet has the unusual distinction of a fine reputation without
470,INTRODUCTION,"having published a book, but his definite contribution to American"
471,INTRODUCTION,"poetry will soon take place with the publication of his first volume,"
472,INTRODUCTION,"“An Old Mercer, and Other Poems.” A poem likely to create a profound"
473,INTRODUCTION,"impression is Don Marquis’s “The God-Maker, Man,”--a fine achievement,"
474,INTRODUCTION,"not only for its flashing images, but for spiritual substance shaped"
475,INTRODUCTION,with compelling conviction.
476,INTRODUCTION,
477,INTRODUCTION,The selections in this volume reflect the extraordinary richness of the
478,INTRODUCTION,published volumes this year. I do not recall any year of the past decade
479,INTRODUCTION,when the quantity and quality alike have been so notable. The autumn
480,INTRODUCTION,season’s publication of verse usually shows a preponderance in quality
481,INTRODUCTION,"of books by English poets, who seem to meet with more favorable"
482,INTRODUCTION,consideration from the best established publishers. There have been this
483,INTRODUCTION,year a number of notable volumes by English poets brought out in this
484,INTRODUCTION,"country, but the balance of distinction, both in standard and numbers of"
485,INTRODUCTION,"books, belongs this year most emphatically to the American poets."
486,INTRODUCTION,"Thirty-five volumes of distinguished poetry stand to our credit, and"
487,INTRODUCTION,these are only a selection from a larger number of books which merit
488,INTRODUCTION,"appreciation. Books by Louis V. Ledoux, George Edward Woodberry, Louis"
489,INTRODUCTION,"Untermeyer, Walter Conrad Arensberg, William Rose Benét, Vachel Lindsay,"
490,INTRODUCTION,"George Sterling, Olive Tilford Dargan, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson,"
491,INTRODUCTION,"Conrad Aiken, James Oppenheim, Harry Kemp, Amelia Josephine Burr, Joyce"
492,INTRODUCTION,"Kilmer, Amy Lowell, Percy MacKaye, Arthur Davison Ficke, Edwin Markham,"
493,INTRODUCTION,"Agnes Lee, and Bliss Carman, are among those which have advanced the"
494,INTRODUCTION,significance of the year’s output.
495,INTRODUCTION,
496,INTRODUCTION,The European war has had a more immediate effect upon literature than
497,INTRODUCTION,almost anything else. All books of a non-military character published
498,INTRODUCTION,"just before the war, with the exception of poetry, have been thrown into"
499,INTRODUCTION,relatively ineffective significance. Poetry endures because it is
500,INTRODUCTION,"integrally woven with the warp of man’s real existence, and not of that"
501,INTRODUCTION,"illusory substance, of which other kinds of imaginative literature are"
502,INTRODUCTION,"fashioned, and which has been so easily wiped away by this war’s primal"
503,INTRODUCTION,brutality. And poetry has aspired to sustain the nobler part of man’s
504,INTRODUCTION,nature during the confusion into which civilization has been plunged
505,INTRODUCTION,"since the war began. The English people, who have been in the world’s"
506,INTRODUCTION,"vanguard practising democratic ideals, have, in their poets to-day,"
507,INTRODUCTION,shattered the idol of war and are glorifying the ideals of peace.
508,INTRODUCTION,
509,INTRODUCTION,The best poems in English directly inspired by the war have been
510,INTRODUCTION,produced by American poets. Of these I have gathered a representative
511,INTRODUCTION,group in this volume. The work achieved by Percy MacKaye on different
512,INTRODUCTION,phases of the European war has made more secure than ever his position
513,INTRODUCTION,as a poet. It is no exaggeration to say that the two groups of sonnets
514,INTRODUCTION,which originally appeared in the _Boston Transcript_ in August and
515,INTRODUCTION,"September, and which are now included in his volume, “The Present Hour,”"
516,INTRODUCTION,"are comparable as a whole to William Watson’s “The Purple East,” and in"
517,INTRODUCTION,"such individual pieces as “Kruppism,” and “The Real Germany,” he has"
518,INTRODUCTION,done work finer and more impressive than is to be found in any of the
519,INTRODUCTION,"older writer’s sonnets. Moreover, such pieces as “If!” and “The Other"
520,INTRODUCTION,"Army,” by Bartholomew F. Griffin; “Prelude,” by Edmond McKenna; “He Went"
521,INTRODUCTION,"for a Soldier,” by Ruth Comfort Mitchell, and “To a Necrophile,” by"
522,INTRODUCTION,"Walter Conrad Arensberg, are striking and spontaneous poetry of a high"
523,INTRODUCTION,"order. In E. Sutton, a poet is presented, who has produced martial"
524,INTRODUCTION,"poetry in “The Bugle,” “The Drum,” and the stirring “Pipes of the"
525,INTRODUCTION,"North,” which, for swinging rhythm and profound reflection upon the pomp"
526,INTRODUCTION,"and futility of military glory, has not been equalled by any"
527,INTRODUCTION,contemporary poet.
528,INTRODUCTION,
529,INTRODUCTION,A notable feature of the poetry year is the Kennerley edition of Walt
530,INTRODUCTION,Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.” The works of Whitman have been transferred
531,INTRODUCTION,"from publisher to publisher so often, that there has been little"
532,INTRODUCTION,opportunity for their circulation among the people for whom he wrote.
533,INTRODUCTION,This edition contains the text and arrangement preferred by the poet
534,INTRODUCTION,"himself, and is the only perfect and complete issue, comprising one"
535,INTRODUCTION,hundred and six additional poems not included in any other edition.
536,INTRODUCTION,There are suitable editions to meet the demand of all classes of Whitman
537,INTRODUCTION,"enthusiasts and students: an India paper edition bound in leather, a"
538,INTRODUCTION,"library edition bound in cloth, and two issues of a Popular edition,"
539,INTRODUCTION,bound in cloth and in paper respectively. To these are added the
540,INTRODUCTION,“Complete Prose” in a Library and Popular edition in cloth. None of the
541,INTRODUCTION,leading American poets of the past generation have been so unfortunate
542,INTRODUCTION,in publication; and many who believe Whitman to be America’s greatest
543,INTRODUCTION,"poet will be glad to know, that now, by the authorization of his"
544,INTRODUCTION,"executors, all his works are gathered in uniform editions under one"
545,INTRODUCTION,imprint.
546,INTRODUCTION,
547,INTRODUCTION,Other important new editions of poetry are the cheap reissue by the
548,INTRODUCTION,Oxford University Press of John Sampson’s final and authoritative text
549,INTRODUCTION,"of William Blake’s complete poems, and the new reprint in Bohn’s Popular"
550,INTRODUCTION,Library issued by The Macmillan Company of Henry Vaughan’s Complete
551,INTRODUCTION,Poems.

555,INTRODUCTION,"As in former years in my annual summary in the _Boston Transcript_, I"
556,INTRODUCTION,have examined the contents of the leading American magazines. To the
557,INTRODUCTION,"seven magazines which I examined last year,--namely, _Harper’s_,"
558,INTRODUCTION,"_Scribner’s_, _The Century_, _The Forum_, _Lippincott’s_, _The Smart"
559,INTRODUCTION,"Set_, and _The Bellman_,--I have added this year three monthlies, _The"
560,INTRODUCTION,"Trend_, _The International_, and _The Masses_; and one quarterly, _The"
561,INTRODUCTION,"Yale Review_. _The Bellman_ still maintains its high poetic distinction,"
562,INTRODUCTION,by virtue of which it prints more good poetry than any other American
563,INTRODUCTION,"weekly, and most American monthlies. As last year, I have winnowed from"
564,INTRODUCTION,other magazines distinctive poems for classification and notice:--one
565,INTRODUCTION,"each from _The Metropolitan_, _The Craftsman_, _The Poetry Journal_, the"
566,INTRODUCTION,"_Southern Woman’s Magazine_, _Puck_, and _The Infantry Journal_; and two"
567,INTRODUCTION,"each from _Poetry: A Magazine of Verse_, _The Nation_, _The Atlantic"
568,INTRODUCTION,"Monthly_, and the _Outlook_; while from three newspapers I have selected"
569,INTRODUCTION,"fourteen poems:--eleven from the _Boston Evening Transcript_, two from"
570,INTRODUCTION,"the _Boston News Bureau_, and one from the _New York Evening Sun_. In"
571,INTRODUCTION,"quoting from the _Boston Transcript_, I wish to testify to the ready"
572,INTRODUCTION,recognition and encouragement this daily paper has offered to poets and
573,INTRODUCTION,poetry. It is one of the paper’s finest traditions.
574,INTRODUCTION,
575,INTRODUCTION,The poems published during the year in the eleven representative
576,INTRODUCTION,"magazines I have submitted to an impartial critical test, choosing from"
577,INTRODUCTION,the total number what I consider the “distinctive” poems of the year.
578,INTRODUCTION,"From the distinctive pieces are selected fifty-two poems, to which are"
579,INTRODUCTION,added thirty from other magazines and from newspapers not represented in
580,INTRODUCTION,"the list of eleven, making a total of eighty-two, which are intended to"
581,INTRODUCTION,represent what I call an “Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1914.”
582,INTRODUCTION,
583,INTRODUCTION,"Quoting from what I have written in previous years, to emphasize the"
584,INTRODUCTION,"methods which guided my selections, the reader will see how impartial"
585,INTRODUCTION,are the tests by which the distinctive and best poems are chosen: “I
586,INTRODUCTION,have not allowed any special sympathy with the subject to influence my
587,INTRODUCTION,"choice. I have taken the poet’s point of view, and accepted his value of"
588,INTRODUCTION,the theme he dealt with. The question was: How vital and compelling did
589,INTRODUCTION,he make it? The first test was the sense of pleasure the poem
590,INTRODUCTION,communicated; then to discover the secret or the meaning of the pleasure
591,INTRODUCTION,felt; and in doing so to realize how much richer one became in a
592,INTRODUCTION,knowledge of the purpose of life by reason of the poem’s message.”
593,INTRODUCTION,
594,INTRODUCTION,In one hundred and forty-seven numbers of these eleven magazines I find
595,INTRODUCTION,"there were published during 1914 a total of 647 poems, of which 157 were"
596,INTRODUCTION,poems of distinction. The total number of poems printed in each

623,INTRODUCTION,"the publishers of these magazines and newspapers, for kind permission"
624,INTRODUCTION,to reprint in this volume the poems making up the “Anthology of Magazine
625,INTRODUCTION,Verse for 1914.” To the authors of these poems I am equally indebted and
626,INTRODUCTION,grateful for their willingness to have me reprint their work in this
627,INTRODUCTION,form. Since their appearance in the magazines and before the close of
628,INTRODUCTION,"the year when the contents of this volume was made up, twenty-eight"
629,INTRODUCTION,poems herein included have appeared in volumes of original poetry by
630,INTRODUCTION,their authors. For the use of “Yankee Doodle” and “The Firemen’s Ball”
631,INTRODUCTION,"by Vachel Lindsay, included in his volume “The Congo, and Other Poems”;"
632,INTRODUCTION,"of “Fight,” “France,” and “Six Sonnets (August, 1914)” by Percy MacKaye,"
633,INTRODUCTION,included in his volume “The Present Hour”; and for “Romance” by Conrad
634,INTRODUCTION,"Aiken, included in his volume “Earth Triumphant,” I have also to thank"
635,INTRODUCTION,"The Macmillan Company, under whose imprint these volumes appear. Similar"
636,INTRODUCTION,acknowledgment is due to the George H. Doran Company for permission to
637,INTRODUCTION,"reprint “The Twelve-Forty-Five” by Joyce Kilmer, included in his volume,"
638,INTRODUCTION,“Trees and Other Poems”; and to print “In the Roman Forum” and “A
639,INTRODUCTION,"Lynmouth Widow” by Amelia Josephine Burr, included in her volume “In"
640,INTRODUCTION,Deep Places.” I am grateful to Charles Scribner’s Sons for two poems by
641,INTRODUCTION,"Olive Tilford Dargan, “Old Fairingdown” and “Path Flower,” included in"
642,INTRODUCTION,her volume “Path Flower”; and for two poems by Corinne Roosevelt
643,INTRODUCTION,"Robinson, “From a Motor in May,” and “If You Should Cease to Love Me,”"
644,INTRODUCTION,included in her volume “One Woman to Another.” I am indebted to Mr.
645,INTRODUCTION,"Mitchell Kennerley for kind permission to reprint Sonnets XXIX, XXX, and"
646,INTRODUCTION,XXXVII from “Sonnets of a Portrait-Painter”; and to Mr. A. M. Robertson
647,INTRODUCTION,"for two poems by George Sterling, “Ballad of Two Seas” and “The Hunting"
648,INTRODUCTION,"of Dian,” included in his volume “Beyond the Breakers, and Other Poems.”"
649,INTRODUCTION,"Finally, The Century Company have been kind enough to permit me to"
650,INTRODUCTION,"republish “Landscapes” and “Summons” by Louis Untermeyer, from his"
651,INTRODUCTION,"volume entitled “Challenge”; and “Patterns,” “A Handful of Dust,” and"
652,INTRODUCTION,"“We Dead” by James Oppenheim, from his volume entitled “Songs for a New"
653,INTRODUCTION,"Age.” If I have omitted any acknowledgments, it is quite unintentional,"
654,INTRODUCTION,and I trust that any such omission will be regarded leniently. I wish it
655,INTRODUCTION,"to be understood that the privilege extended to me so courteously, by"
656,INTRODUCTION,"the authors, magazine editors and publishers, and book publishers, to"
657,INTRODUCTION,"print the poems in this volume, does not in any sense restrict the"
658,INTRODUCTION,authors in their rights to print the poems in volumes of their own or in
659,INTRODUCTION,any other place. I wish to thank the _Boston Transcript_ for the
660,INTRODUCTION,privilege of reprinting material in this book which originally appeared
661,INTRODUCTION,in the columns of that paper.
662,INTRODUCTION,
663,INTRODUCTION,A new feature this year is the series of critical summaries of new
664,INTRODUCTION,"volumes of verse, which are significant, and which have been appraised"
665,INTRODUCTION,in accordance with the same principles as the poems in the “Anthology of
666,INTRODUCTION,"Magazine Verse.” It is believed that by adding this feature, the book"
667,INTRODUCTION,will more nearly approximate to being an actual Year-Book of American
668,INTRODUCTION,"Poetry, and it is in this belief that a subtitle has been added to this"
669,INTRODUCTION,"volume. I believe that not only libraries, but private individuals will"
670,INTRODUCTION,"welcome the selected lists of the best volumes for library purchase,"
671,INTRODUCTION,graded according to the requirements of a large or a small purse. A list
672,INTRODUCTION,"is also subjoined of the best books _about_ poetry, and if there seems"
673,INTRODUCTION,"to be a demand for this innovation, it is planned next year to include"
674,INTRODUCTION,"in the book critical summaries of these volumes, as well as of the"
675,INTRODUCTION,volumes of original verse.
676,INTRODUCTION,
677,INTRODUCTION,I shall be grateful for suggestions as to improvements of this year-book
678,INTRODUCTION,"in future years, and as to valuable extensions of its scope. To all"
679,INTRODUCTION,"friends who have assisted this volume by their personal efforts, and to"
680,INTRODUCTION,the readers of past years who have made this annual publication possible
681,INTRODUCTION,"by promoting it through their interest in poetry, I tender my grateful"
682,INTRODUCTION,"thanks. They are too many to name here, but my gratitude for their"
683,INTRODUCTION,efforts is none the less sincere.

898,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,
899,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"So duteous youth was trained, until there grew"

902,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"They cried on mysticism to be gone,"
903,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Mazed in the shadowy princedom of the soul.

905,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Then as old creeds fell round them into dust,"

914,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,As logical and sure as music’s own.

919,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,As on they fared through that unfolding world.
920,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Yet there they found no rest-house for the heart,"
921,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"No wells sufficient for the spirit’s thirst,"
922,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,No shade nor glory for the senses starved....
923,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Turning--they fled by moonlit trails to seek
924,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"The magic principality of Art,"
925,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Where loveliness, not learning, rules supreme."
926,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,They stood intoxicated with delight before
927,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,The poised unanxious splendor of the Greek;
928,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"They mused upon the Gothic minsters gray,"
929,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Where mystic spirit took on mighty form,"
930,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Until their prayers to lovely churches turned--

934,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Where color wasted by the Scituate shore
935,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Between the changing marshes and the sea;
936,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,They heard the golden voice of poesie
937,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Lulling the senses with its last caress
938,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,In Tennysonian accents pure and fine;
939,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"And all their laurels were for Beauty’s brow,"

941,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,
942,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Then poisonous weeds of artifice sprang up,"
943,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Defiling Nature at her sacred source;
944,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"And there the questing World-soul could not stay,"
945,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Onward must journey with the changing time,"
946,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"To come to this uncouth rebellious age,"
947,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Where not an ancient creed nor courtesy
948,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Is underided, and each demagogue"
949,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,Cries some new nostrum for the cure of ills.
950,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,To-day the unreasoning iconoclast
951,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Would scoff at science and abolish art,"
952,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,To let untutored impulse rule the world.
953,PHI BETA KAPPA POEM,"Let learning perish, and the race return"

1232,YANKEE DOODLE,"yet in a slower, more orotund fashion. It is presumably an exercise"
1233,YANKEE DOODLE,for an entertainment on the evening of Washington’s Birthday.
1234,YANKEE DOODLE,
1235,YANKEE DOODLE,
1236,YANKEE DOODLE,Dawn this morning burned all red
1237,YANKEE DOODLE,Watching them in wonder.
1238,YANKEE DOODLE,There I saw our spangled flag
1239,YANKEE DOODLE,Divide the clouds asunder.
1240,YANKEE DOODLE,Then there followed Washington.
1241,YANKEE DOODLE,"Ah, he rode from glory,"
1242,YANKEE DOODLE,Cold and mighty as his name
1243,YANKEE DOODLE,And stern as Freedom’s story.
1244,YANKEE DOODLE,Unsubdued by burning dawn
1245,YANKEE DOODLE,Led his continentals.
1246,YANKEE DOODLE,"Vast they were, and strange to see"
1247,YANKEE DOODLE,In gray old regimentals:--
1248,YANKEE DOODLE,"Marching still with bleeding feet,"
1249,YANKEE DOODLE,Bleeding feet and jesting--
1250,YANKEE DOODLE,Marching from the judgment throne
1251,YANKEE DOODLE,With energy unresting.
1252,YANKEE DOODLE,How their merry quickstep played--
1253,YANKEE DOODLE,"Silver, sharp, sonorous,"
1254,YANKEE DOODLE,Piercing through with prophecy
1255,YANKEE DOODLE,The demons’ rumbling chorus--
1256,YANKEE DOODLE,Behold the ancient powers of sin
1257,YANKEE DOODLE,And slavery before them!--
1258,YANKEE DOODLE,"Sworn to stop the glorious dawn,"
1259,YANKEE DOODLE,The pit-black clouds hung o’er them.
1260,YANKEE DOODLE,"Plagues that rose to blast the day,"
1261,YANKEE DOODLE,"Fiend and tiger faces,"
1262,YANKEE DOODLE,Monsters plotting bloodshed for
1263,YANKEE DOODLE,The patient toiling races.
1264,YANKEE DOODLE,"Round the dawn their cannon raged,"
1265,YANKEE DOODLE,"Hurling bolts of thunder,"
1266,YANKEE DOODLE,Yet before our spangled flag
1267,YANKEE DOODLE,Their host was cut asunder.
1268,YANKEE DOODLE,Like a mist they fled away....
1269,YANKEE DOODLE,Ended wrath and roaring.
1270,YANKEE DOODLE,Still our restless soldier-host
1271,YANKEE DOODLE,From East to West went pouring.
1272,YANKEE DOODLE,High beside the sun of noon
1273,YANKEE DOODLE,They bore our banner splendid.
1274,YANKEE DOODLE,All its days of stain and shame
1275,YANKEE DOODLE,And heaviness were ended.
1276,YANKEE DOODLE,Men were swelling now the throng
1277,YANKEE DOODLE,From great and lowly station--
1278,YANKEE DOODLE,Valiant citizens to-day
1279,YANKEE DOODLE,Of every tribe and nation.
1280,YANKEE DOODLE,"Not till night their rear-guard came,"
1281,YANKEE DOODLE,"Down the west went marching,"
1282,YANKEE DOODLE,And left behind the sunset rays
1283,YANKEE DOODLE,In beauty overarching.
1284,YANKEE DOODLE,"War-god banners lead us still,"
1285,YANKEE DOODLE,"Rob, enslave and harry;"

1291,YANKEE DOODLE,And heaviness be ended.

1320,I,Till all the snow danced red. The little shacks

1343,I,Blowing white frost-wreaths from red mouth agap
1344,I,"Till, in a gabled porch beyond the store,"
1345,I,He burst the door;
1346,I,
1347,I,“Mother!” he panted. “Hush! Your pa ain’t up;
1348,I,He’s worser since this storm. What’s struck ye so?”
1349,I,“It’s volunteers!” The old dame stammered “Oh!”
1350,I,"And stopped, and stirred her sup"
1351,I,"Of morning tea, and stared down in the trembling cup."
1352,I,"“They’re musterin’ on the common now.” “I know,”"
1353,I,She nodded feebly; then with sharp surmise
1354,I,She raised her eyes:
1355,I,
1356,I,"She raised her eyes, and poured their light on him"
1357,I,"Who towered glowing there--bright lips apart,"
1358,I,"Cap off, and brown hair tousled. With quick smart"
1359,I,She felt the room turn dim
1360,I,"And seemed she heard, far off, a sound of cherubim"
1361,I,Soothing the sudden pain about her heart.
1362,I,How many a lonely hour of after-woe
1363,I,She saw him so!
1364,I,
1365,I,“Jock!” And once more the white lips murmured “Jock!”
1366,I,Her fingers slipped; the spilling teacup fell
1367,I,"And shattered, tinkling--but broke not the spell."
1368,I,"His heart began to knock,"
1369,I,Jangling the hollow rhythm of the ticking clock.
1370,I,"“Mother, it’s fight, and men are wanted!” “Well,"
1371,I,"Ah well, it’s men may kill us women’s joys,"
1372,I,It’s men--not boys!”
1373,I,
1374,I,“I’m seventeen! I guess that seventeen--”
1375,I,“My little Jock!” “Little! I’m six-foot-one.
1376,I,"(Scorn twitched his lip.) You saw me, how I skun"
1377,I,The town last Hallowe’en
1378,I,At wrastlin’.” (Now the mother shifted tack.) “But Jean?
1379,I,You won’t be leavin’ _Jean_?” “I guess a gun
1380,I,"Won’t rattle _her_.” He laughed, and turned his head."
1381,I,His face grew red.
1382,I,
1383,I,“But if it doos--a gal don’t understand:
1384,I,"It’s fight!” “Jock, boy, your pa can’t last much more,"
1385,I,And who’s to mind the stock--to milk and chore?”
1386,I,Jock frowned and gnawed his hand.
1387,I,"“Mother, it’s _men_ must mind the stock--our own born land,"
1388,I,And lick the invaders.” Slowly in the door
1389,I,"Stubbed the old, worn-out man. “Woman, let be!"
1390,I,It’s liberty:
1391,I,
1392,I,“It’s struck him like fork-lightnin’ in a pine.
1393,I,"I felt it, too, like that in seventy-six;"
1394,I,"And now, if ’twa’n’t for creepin’ pains and cricks"
1395,I,"And this one leg o’ mine,"
1396,I,"I’d holler young Jerusalem like him, and jine"
1397,I,The fight; but fight don’t come from burnt-out wicks;
1398,I,"It comes from fire.” “Mebbe,” she said, “it comes"
1399,I,From fifes and drums.”
1400,I,
1401,I,"“Dad, all the boys are down from the back hills."
1402,I,The common’s cacklin’ like hell’s cocks and hens;
1403,I,There’s swords and muskets stacked in the cow-pens
1404,I,And knapsacks in the mills;
1405,I,"They say at Isle aux Noix Redcoats are holding drills,"
1406,I,And we’re to build a big fleet at Vergennes.
1407,I,"Dad, can’t I go?” “I reckon you’re a man:"
1408,I,Of course you can.
1409,I,
1410,I,"“I’ll do the chores to home, you do ’em _thar_!”"
1411,I,“Dad!”--“Lad!” The men gripped hands and gazed upon
1412,I,"The mother, when the door flew wide. There shone"
1413,I,"A young face like a star,"
1414,I,"A gleam of bitter-sweet ’gainst snowy islands far,"
1415,I,"A freshness, like the scent of cinnamon,"
1416,I,Tingeing the air with ardor and bright sheen.
1417,I,Jock faltered: “Jean!”
1418,I,
1419,I,"“Jock, don’t you hear the drums? I dreamed all night"
1420,I,"I heard ’em, and they woke me in black dark."
1421,I,"Quick, ain’t you comin’? Can’t you hear ’em? Hark!"
1422,I,The men-folks are to fight.
1423,I,I wish I was a man!” Jock felt his throat clutch tight.
1424,I,“Men-folks!” It lit his spirit like a spark
1425,I,Flashing the pent gunpowder of his pride.
1426,I,“Come on!” he cried.
1427,I,
1428,I,“Here--wait!” The old man stumped to the back wall
1429,I,And handed down his musket. “You’ll want this;
1430,I,"And mind what game you’re after, and don’t miss."
1431,I,Good-by: I guess that’s all
1432,I,For now. Come back and get your duds.”
1433,I,"Jock, looming tall"
1434,I,"Beside his glowing sweetheart, stooped to kiss"
1435,I,The little shrunken mother. Tiptoe she rose
1436,I,And clutched him--close.
1437,I,
1438,I,In both her twisted hands she held his head
1439,I,Clutched in the wild remembrance of dim years--
1440,I,"A baby head, suckling, half dewed with tears;"
1441,I,A tired boy abed
1442,I,By candlelight; a laughing face beside the red
1443,I,Log-fire; a shock of curls beneath her shears--
1444,I,"The bright hair falling. Ah, she tried to smother"
1445,I,Her wild thoughts.--“Mother!
1446,I,
1447,I,“Mother!” he stuttered. “Baby Jock!” she moaned
1448,I,And looked far in his eyes.--And he was gone.
1449,I,The porch door banged. Out in the blood-bright dawn
1450,I,All that she once had owned--
1451,I,"Her heart’s proud empire--passed, her life’s dream sank unthroned."
1452,I,"With hands still reached, she stood there staring, wan."
1453,I,"“Hark, woman!” said the bowed old man. “What’s tolling?”"
1454,I,Drums--drums were rolling.
1455,I,
1456,I,
1457,II,II
1458,II,
1459,II,"Shy wings flashed in the orchard, _glitter, glitter_;"
1460,II,"Blue wings bloomed soft through blossom-colored leaves,"
1461,II,And _Phœbe! Phœbe!_ whistled from gray eaves
1462,II,Through water-shine and twitter
1463,II,And spurt of flamey green. All bane of earth and bitter
1464,II,Took life and tasted sweet at the glad reprieves
1465,II,"Of spring, save only in an old dame’s heart"
1466,II,That grieved apart.
1467,II,
1468,II,"Crook-back and small, she poled the big wellsweep:"
1469,II,_Creak_ went the pole; the bucket came up brimming.
1470,II,On the bright water lay a cricket swimming
1471,II,Whose brown legs tried to leap
1472,II,
1473,II,"But, draggling, twitched and foundered in the circling deep."
1474,II,"The old dame gasped; her thin hand snatched him, skimming."
1475,II,"“Dear Lord, he’s drowned,” she mumbled with dry lips;"
1476,II,“The ships! the ships!”
1477,II,
1478,II,Gently she laid him in the sun and dried
1479,II,The little dripping body. Suddenly
1480,II,Rose-red gleamed through the budding apple tree
1481,II,And “Look! a letter!” cried
1482,II,A laughing voice; “and lots of news for us inside!”
1483,II,"“How’s that, Jean? News from Jock! Where--where is he?”"
1484,II,"“Down in Vergennes--the ship-yards.” “Ships! Ah, no!"
1485,II,It can’t be so.”
1486,II,
1487,II,“He’s going to fight with guns and be a tar.
1488,II,See here: he’s wrote himself. The post was late.
1489,II,He couldn’t write before. The ship is great!
1490,II,"She’s built, from keel to spar,"
1491,II,And called the _Saratoga_; and Jock’s got a scar
1492,II,"Already--” “Scar?” the mother quavered. “Wait,”"
1493,II,"Jean rippled, “let me read.” “Quick, then, my dear,"
1494,II,_He’ll_ want to hear--”
1495,II,
1496,II,“Jock’s pa; I guess we’ll find him in the yard.
1497,II,"He ain’t scarce creepin’ round these days, poor Dan!”"
1498,II,"She gripped Jean’s arm and stumbled as they ran,"
1499,II,"And stopped once, breathing hard."
1500,II,Around them chimney-swallows skimmed the sheep-cropped sward
1501,II,And yellow hornets hummed. The sick old man
1502,II,"Stirred at their steps, and muttered from deep muse:"
1503,II,"“Well, ma; what news?”"
1504,II,
1505,II,“From Jockie--there’s a letter!” In his chair
1506,II,The bowed form sat bolt upright. “What’s he say?”
1507,II,“He’s wrote to Jean. I guess it’s boys their way
1508,II,To think old folks don’t care
1509,II,"For letters.” “Girl, read out.” Jean smoothed her wilding hair"
1510,II,And sat beside them. Out of the blue day
1511,II,A golden robin called; across the road
1512,II,A heifer lowed;
1513,II,
1514,II,"And old ears listened while youth read: “‘Friend Jean,"
1515,II,Vergennes: here’s where we’ve played a Yankee trick.
1516,II,I’m layin’ in my bunk by Otter Crick
1517,II,And scribblin’ you this mean
1518,II,Scrawl for to tell the news--what-all I’ve heerd and seen:
1519,II,"Jennie, we’ve built a ship, and built her slick--"
1520,II,"A swan!--a seven hundred forty tonner,"
1521,II,And I’m first gunner.
1522,II,
1523,II,“‘You ought to seen us launch her t’other day!”
1524,II,Tell dad we’ve christened her for a fight of hisn
1525,II,He fought at Saratoga. Now just listen!
1526,II,"She’s twice as big, folks say,"
1527,II,As Perry’s ship that took the prize at Put-in-Bay;
1528,II,"Yet forty days ago, hull, masts, and mizzen,"
1529,II,"The whole of her was growin’, live and limber,"
1530,II,In God’s green timber.
1531,II,
1532,II,“‘I helped to fell her main-mast back in March.
1533,II,The woods was snowed knee-deep. She was a wonder:
1534,II,A straight white pine. She fell like roarin’ thunder
1535,II,And left a blue-sky arch
1536,II,
1537,II,"Above her, bustin’ all to kindlin’s a tall larch.--"
1538,II,Mebbe the scart jack-rabbits skun from under!
1539,II,"Us boys hoorayed, and me and every noodle"
1540,II,Yelled Yankee Doodle!
1541,II,
1542,II,"“‘My, how we haw’d and gee’d the big ox-sledges"
1543,II,"Haulin’ her long trunk through the hemlock dells,"
1544,II,"A-bellerin’ to the tinkle-tankle bells,"
1545,II,And blunted our ax edges
1546,II,Hackin’ new roads of ice ’longside the rocky ledges.
1547,II,"We stalled her twice, but gave the oxen spells"
1548,II,And yanked her through at last on the home-clearin’--
1549,II,"Lord, wa’n’t we cheerin’!"
1550,II,
1551,II,"“‘Since then I’ve seen her born, as you might say:"
1552,II,"Born out of fire and water and men’s sweatin’,"
1553,II,Blast-furnace rairin’ and red anvils frettin’
1554,II,"And sawmills, night and day,"
1555,II,Screech-owlin’ like ’twas Satan’s rumhouse run away
1556,II,Smellin’ of tar and pitch. But I’m forgettin’
1557,II,The man that’s primed her guns and paid her score:
1558,II,The Commodore.
1559,II,
1560,II,"“‘Macdonough--he’s her master, and she knows"
1561,II,"His voice, like he was talkin’ to his hound."
1562,II,There ain’t a man of her but ruther’d drown’d
1563,II,Than tread upon his toes;
1564,II,"And yet with his red cheeks and twinklin’ eyes, a rose"
1565,II,"Ain’t friendler than his looks be. When he’s round,"
1566,II,He makes you feel like you’re a gentleman
1567,II,American.
1568,II,
1569,II,“‘But I must tell you how we’re hidin’ here.
1570,II,"This Otter Crick is like a crook-neck jug,"
1571,II,And we’re inside. The Redcoats want to plug
1572,II,"The mouth, and cork our beer;"
1573,II,
1574,II,So last week Downie sailed his British lake fleet near
1575,II,"To fill our channel, but us boys had dug"
1576,II,"Big shore intrenchments, and our batteries"
1577,II,Stung ’em like bees
1578,II,
1579,II,“’Till they skedaddled whimperin’ up the lake;
1580,II,"But while the shots was flyin’, in the scrimmage,"
1581,II,I caught a ball that scotched my livin’ image.--
1582,II,"Now, Jean, for Sam Hill’s sake,"
1583,II,"Don’t let-on this to mother, for, you know, she’d make"
1584,II,A deary-me-in’ that would last a grim age.
1585,II,"’Tain’t much, but when a feller goes to war"
1586,II,What’s he go for
1587,II,
1588,II,"“‘If ’taint to fight, and take his chances?’” Jean"
1589,II,Stopped and looked down. The mother did not speak.
1590,II,"“Go on,” said the old man. Flush tinged her cheek."
1591,II,“Truly I didn’t mean--
1592,II,"There ain’t much more. He says: ‘Goodbye now, little queen;"
1593,II,We’re due to sail for Plattsburgh this day week.
1594,II,Meantime I’m hopin’ hard and takin’ stock.
1595,II,Your obedient--Jock.’”
1596,II,
1597,II,"The girl’s voice ceased in silence. _Glitter, glitter_,"
1598,II,"The shy wings flashed through blossom-colored leaves,"
1599,II,And _Phœbe! Phœbe!_ whistled from gray eaves
1600,II,Through water-shine and twitter
1601,II,And spurt of flamey green. But bane of thought is bitter.
1602,II,"The mother’s heart spurned May’s sweet make-believes,"
1603,II,"For there, through falling masts and gaunt ships looming,"
1604,II,Guns--guns were booming.
1605,II,
1606,II,
1607,III,III
1608,III,
1609,III,Plattsburgh--and windless beauty on the bay;
1610,III,Autumnal morning and the sun at seven:
1611,III,Southward a wedge of wild ducks in the heaven
1612,III,"Dwindles, and far away"
1613,III,"Dim mountains watch the lake, where lurking for their prey"
1614,III,"Lie, with their muzzled thunders and pent levin,"
1615,III,"The war-ships--Eagle, Preble, Saratoga,"
1616,III,Ticonderoga.
1617,III,
1618,III,And now a little wind from the northwest
1619,III,Flutters the trembling blue with snowy flecks.
1620,III,"A gunner, on Macdonough’s silent decks,"
1621,III,"Peers from his cannon’s rest,"
1622,III,Staring beyond the low north headland. Crest on crest
1623,III,"Behind green spruce-tops, soft as wild-fowls’ necks,"
1624,III,Glide the bright spars and masts and whitened wales
1625,III,Of bellying sails.
1626,III,
1627,III,"Rounding, the British lake-birds loom in view,"
1628,III,Ruffling their wings in silvery arrogance:
1629,III,"Chubb, Linnet, Finch, and lordly Confiance"
1630,III,Leading with Downie’s crew
1631,III,"The line. With long booms swung to starboard they heave to,"
1632,III,Whistling their flock of galleys who advance
1633,III,"Behind, then toward the Yankees, four abreast,"
1634,III,"Tack landward, west."
1635,III,
1636,III,Landward the watching townsfolk strew the shore;
1637,III,Mist-banks of human beings blur the bluffs
1638,III,"And blacken the roofs, like swarms of roosting choughs."
1639,III,Waiting the cannon’s roar
1640,III,A nation holds its breath for knell of Nevermore
1641,III,Or peal of life: this hour shall cast the sloughs
1642,III,Of generations--and one old dame’s joy:
1643,III,Her gunner boy.
1644,III,
1645,III,One moment on the quarter-deck Jock kneels
1646,III,Beside his Commodore and fighting squad.
1647,III,"Their heads are bowed, their prayers go up toward God--"
1648,III,"Toward God, to whom appeals"
1649,III,Still rise in pain and mangling wrath from blind ordeals.
1650,III,"Of man, still boastful of his brother’s blood.--"
1651,III,They stand from prayer. Swift comes and silently
1652,III,The enemy.
1653,III,
1654,III,"Macdonough holds his men, alert, devout:"
1655,III,“He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea
1656,III,"Driven with the wind. Behold the ships, that be"
1657,III,"So great, are turned about"
1658,III,Even with a little helm.” Jock tightens the blue clout
1659,III,"Around his waist, and watches casually"
1660,III,"Close-by a game-cock, in a coop, who stirs"
1661,III,And spreads his spurs.
1662,III,
1663,III,"Now, bristling near, the British war-birds swoop"
1664,III,"Wings, and the Yankee Eagle screams in fire;"
1665,III,"The English Linnet answers, aiming higher,"
1666,III,And _crash_ along Jock’s poop
1667,III,"Her hurtling shot of iron crackles the game-cock’s coop,"
1668,III,"Where, lo! the ribald cock, like a town crier"
1669,III,"Strutting a gunslide, flaps to the cheering crew--"
1670,III,_Yankee-doodle-doo!_
1671,III,
1672,III,"Boys yell, and yapping laughter fills the roar:"
1673,III,"“You bet we’ll do ’em!” “You’re a prophet, cocky!”"
1674,III,"“Hooray, old rooster!” “Hip, hip, hip!” cries Jockie."
1675,III,Calmly the Commodore
1676,III,Touches his cannon’s fuse and fires a twenty-four.
1677,III,Smoke belches black. “Huzza! That’s blowed ’em pocky!”
1678,III,"And Downie’s men, like pins before the bowling,"
1679,III,Fall scatter-rolling.
1680,III,
1681,III,"_Boom!_ flash the long guns, echoed by the galleys."
1682,III,"The Confiance, wind-baffled in the bay"
1683,III,"With both her port-bow anchors torn away,"
1684,III,"Flutters, but proudly rallies"
1685,III,"To broadside, while her gunboats range the water-alleys."
1686,III,"Then Downie grips Macdonough in the fray,"
1687,III,And double-shotted from his roaring flail
1688,III,Hurls the black hail.
1689,III,
1690,III,"The hail turns red, and drips in the hot gloom."
1691,III,Jock snuffs the reek and spits it from his mouth
1692,III,"And grapples with great winds. The winds blow south,"
1693,III,And scent of lilac bloom
1694,III,Steals from his mother’s porch in his still sleeping-room.
1695,III,Lilacs! But now it stinks of blood and drouth!
1696,III,"He staggers up, and stares at blinding light:"
1697,III,“God! This is fight!”
1698,III,
1699,III,Fight! The sharp loathing retches in his loins;
1700,III,"He gulps the black air, like a drowner swimming,"
1701,III,Where little round suns in a dance go rimming
1702,III,The dark with golden coins;
1703,III,Round him and round the splintering masts and jangled quoins
1704,III,"Reel, rattling, and overhead he hears the hymning--"
1705,III,Lonely and loud--of ululating choirs
1706,III,Strangling with wires.
1707,III,
1708,III,"Fight! But no more the roll of chanting drums,"
1709,III,"The fifing flare, the flags, the magic spume"
1710,III,Filling his spirit with a wild perfume;
1711,III,Now noisome anguish numbs
1712,III,"His sense, that mocks and leers at monstrous vacuums."
1713,III,"_Whang!_ splits the spanker near him, and the boom"
1714,III,"Crushes Macdonough, in a jumbled wreck,"
1715,III,Stunned on the deck.
1716,III,
1717,III,"No time to glance where wounded leaders lie,"
1718,III,Or think on fallen sparrows in the storm--
1719,III,Only to fight! The prone commander’s form
1720,III,"Stirs, rises stumblingly,"
1721,III,"And gropes where, under shrieking grape and musketry,"
1722,III,Men’s bodies wamble like a mangled swarm
1723,III,"Of bees. He bends to sight his gun again,"
1724,III,"Bleeding, and then--"
1725,III,
1726,III,"Oh, out of void and old oblivion"
1727,III,And reptile slime first rose Apollo’s head;
1728,III,"And God in likeness of Himself, ’tis said,"
1729,III,"Created such an one,"
1730,III,"Now shaping Shakespeare’s forehead, now Napoleon,"
1731,III,"Various, by infinite invention bred,"
1732,III,In His own image molding beautiful
1733,III,The human skull.
1734,III,
1735,III,Jock lifts his head; Macdonough sights his gun
1736,III,"To fire--but in his face a ball of flesh,"
1737,III,"A whizzing clod, has hurled him in a mesh"
1738,III,"Of tangled rope and tun,"
1739,III,While still about the deck the lubber clod is spun
1740,III,"And, bouncing from the rail, lies in a plesh"
1741,III,"Of oozing blood, upstaring eyeless, red--"
1742,III,A gunner’s head.
1743,III,
1744,III,*       *       *       *       *
1745,III,
1746,III,"Above the ships, enormous from the lake,"
1747,III,"Rises a wraith--a phantom dim and gory,"
1748,III,Lifting her wondrous limbs of smoke and glory;
1749,III,And little children quake
1750,III,"And lordly nations bow their foreheads for her sake,"
1751,III,And bards proclaim her in their fiery story;
1752,III,"And in her phantom breast, heartless unheeding,"
1753,III,Hearts--hearts are bleeding.
1754,III,
1755,III,
1756,IV,IV
1757,IV,
1758,IV,Macdonough lies with Downie in one land.
1759,IV,Victor and vanquished long ago were peers.
1760,IV,"Held in the grip of peace an hundred years,"
1761,IV,England has laid her hand
1762,IV,"In ours, and we have held--and still shall hold--the band"
1763,IV,That makes us brothers of the hemispheres;
1764,IV,"Yea, still shall keep the lasting brotherhood"
1765,IV,Of law and blood.
1766,IV,
1767,IV,Yet one whose terror racked us long of yore
1768,IV,Still wreaks upon the world her lawless might:
1769,IV,Out of the deeps again the phantom Fight
1770,IV,"Looms on her wings of war,"
1771,IV,"Sowing in armèd camps and fields her venomed spore,"
1772,IV,"Embattling monarch’s whim against man’s right,"
1773,IV,Trampling with iron hoofs the blooms of time
1774,IV,Back in the slime.
1775,IV,
1776,IV,"We, who from dreams of justice, dearly wrought,"
1777,IV,"First rose in the eyes of patient Washington,"

1902,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1903,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"In the silence of a midnight lost, lost forevermore,"
1904,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"I stood upon a nameless beach where none had been before,"
1905,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,And red gold and yellow gold were the shells upon that shore.
1906,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1907,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"Lone, lone it was as a mist-enfolded strand"
1908,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Set round a lake where marble demons stand--
1909,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Held like a sapphire-stone in Thibet’s monstrous hand.
1910,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1911,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,And there I beheld how One stood in her grace
1912,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"To hold to the stars her wet and faery face,"
1913,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,And on the smooth and haunted sands her footfall had no trace.
1914,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1915,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"White, white was she as the youngest seraph’s word,"
1916,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"Or milk of Eden’s kine or Eden’s fragrant curd,"
1917,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Cast in love by Eve’s wan hand to her most snowy bird.
1918,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1919,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"Fair, fair was she as Venus of the sky,"
1920,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,And the jasmine of her breast and starlight of her eye
1921,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Made the heart a pain and the soul a hopeless sigh.
1922,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1923,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"Weak with the sight I leaned upon my sword,"
1924,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Till my soul that had sighed was become an unseen chord
1925,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,For stress of music rendered to unknown things adored.
1926,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1927,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"Surely she heard, but her beauty gave no sign"
1928,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"To me for whom the hushed sea was odorous as wine,--"
1929,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,To me for whom the voiceless world was made her silent shrine.
1930,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1931,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"And she sent forth her gaze to the waters of the West,"
1932,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"And she sent forth her soul to the Islands of the Blest,"
1933,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Below a star whose silver throes set pearls upon her breast.
1934,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1935,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"But chill in the East brake a glory on the lands,"
1936,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"And she moaned like some low wave that dies on frozen sands,"
1937,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,And held to her sea-lover sweet and cruel hands.
1938,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1939,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"Then rose the moon, and its lance was in her side,"
1940,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"And there was bitter music because in woe she cried,"
1941,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,Ere on the hard and gleaming beach she laid her down and died.
1942,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1943,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"I leapt to her succor, my sword I left behind;"
1944,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,But one low mound of opal foam was all that I could find--
1945,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,A moon-washed length of airy gems that trembled in the wind.
1946,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,
1947,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,I knelt below the stars; the sea put forth a wave;
1948,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,"The moon drew up the captive tides upon her shining grave,"
1949,THE HUNTING OF DIAN,As far away I heard the cry her dim sea-lover gave.

2262,SUMMONS,"And as it hung there, vivid and unreal,"
2263,SUMMONS,The whole world’s lethargy was brushed away;
2264,SUMMONS,The night kept tugging at my torpid mood

2266,SUMMONS,My wintry slothfulness beyond the stars;

2268,SUMMONS,A myriad urges in one rushing wave....
2269,SUMMONS,"Touched with the lavish miracles of earth,"
2270,SUMMONS,I felt the brave persistence of the grass;
2271,SUMMONS,"The far desire of rivulets; the keen,"

2279,SUMMONS,Out of old graves arose the cry of life;
2280,SUMMONS,Out of the dying came the deathless call.
2281,SUMMONS,"And, thrilling with a new sweet restlessness,"
2282,SUMMONS,The thing that was my boyhood woke in me--
2283,SUMMONS,"Dear, foolish fragments made me strong again;"

2285,SUMMONS,"And all the vague, heroic hopes of youth,"

2298,SUMMONS,"And Beauty, rising out of all its forms,"
2299,SUMMONS,"Beauty, the passion of the universe,"
2300,SUMMONS,"Flamed with its joy, a thing too great for tears,"

2344,NEW YORK,Sea-rimmed and teeming with millions poured out on thy granite shore
2345,NEW YORK,"Surge upon surge, many-nationed, O City far-famed for the roar"
2346,NEW YORK,"Of thy cavernous iron streets and thy towers half hung in the sun,"
2347,NEW YORK,"Rising in layer on layer, twelve cities piled upon one,"
2348,NEW YORK,"All feeding and sleeping and breeding, enormous, half palace, half den,"
2349,NEW YORK,"With ever a tide washing through thee whose clamoring waters are men,"
2350,NEW YORK,"O where is the hand of thy builder? What god, canst thou tell,"
2351,NEW YORK,Hath his hand on the clay of thy face? Or what demon from Hell?
2352,NEW YORK,I have viewed with the eye of the stranger and the pride of
2353,NEW YORK,the New World man
2354,NEW YORK,"The mountainous leap of thy glory, the miles of thy endless span,"
2355,NEW YORK,And my heart has gone up with thy towers and my love has fallen as dew
2356,NEW YORK,On thy night-blooming lamps in rows on thy beautiful Avenue.
2357,NEW YORK,I have stood with a seaman’s glass on the roofs of thy high hotels;
2358,NEW YORK,I have rolled through the sheer ravines where the cliff dweller dwells;
2359,NEW YORK,I have peered from the place of the Tomb far up where the hills break free
2360,NEW YORK,And the length of the lordly River comes down as a bride to the sea;
2361,NEW YORK,I have fled with a roar through the rock where the myriad lights flash by;
2362,NEW YORK,I have heard the song of the soaring steel come down from the sky;
2363,NEW YORK,I have watched as a lover thy waters all mottled with cloud and with sun
2364,NEW YORK,"Where the ocean comes in to caress thee, O Beautiful One;"
2365,NEW YORK,"And the days and the years of my life are a gift unto thee,"
2366,NEW YORK,"And I dwell in thy marvelous gates, O Goddess cast up by the sea!"
2367,NEW YORK,
2368,NEW YORK,I have surged with the morning throng down the gulf of the Great White Way
2369,NEW YORK,That gashes thy granite length from the towers of sleep to the Bay
2370,NEW YORK,When the West rolls in with a rush and the North comes down with a roar
2371,NEW YORK,And the tramp of the Island men is loud on thy island shore.
2372,NEW YORK,"Shoulder to shoulder they come from the loins of a hundred lands,"
2373,NEW YORK,"The men with the New World brains and the men with the Old World hands,"
2374,NEW YORK,And the vision is bright on the sky of the City to be
2375,NEW YORK,And the joy of the morning is there and the thrill of the sea.
2376,NEW YORK,"As a surf is the sound of thy labor, O City; as wine"
2377,NEW YORK,Is the hum of thy human streets filled with faces divine
2378,NEW YORK,When from building on populous building thy power unfurled
2379,NEW YORK,Leaps down to the sea and off through the air to the ends of the world.
2380,NEW YORK,I have loafed round the banging wharves where the foreign freighters lie;
2381,NEW YORK,I have watched the bridge-weaving shuttles pass over the sky;
2382,NEW YORK,I have felt the quick leap of thy drills where the builders of Rome
2383,NEW YORK,Swing the rock from the hole in the ground for the walls of thy home;
2384,NEW YORK,I have heard far down through the canyons the clamor and yell
2385,NEW YORK,When the brokers are out with their signs and the Curb is a hell;
2386,NEW YORK,I have sounded thy chattering markets; I have watched the noon hour
2387,NEW YORK,Come over thy toiling miles with a slack of thy terrible power
2388,NEW YORK,When story on story lets out on the pavement below
2389,NEW YORK,And thy streets are a-swarm with the Jew and the parks overflow.
2390,NEW YORK,"Far-famed is the rustling hour when the shoppers flow in,"
2391,NEW YORK,"For miles thy walks are abloom and the monstrous fairs begin,"
2392,NEW YORK,"And the aisles of the merchants are crowded, and dark-faced boys,"
2393,NEW YORK,"Are out on the corners with flowers, and fakirs are there with their toys."
2394,NEW YORK,I have paused with the passing throng where the hoyden sea wind whirls
2395,NEW YORK,And whisks round the tall gray towers the skirts of the laughing girls;
2396,NEW YORK,I have watched round the wonder of windows the beauty and grace;
2397,NEW YORK,I have breasted the streaming throngs and have come to the quiet place
2398,NEW YORK,"Of the Fountain, and weary with tramping have lounged on the benches there"
2399,NEW YORK,"With the homeless man of the streets, the man with the unkempt hair;"
2400,NEW YORK,Have given him soul for soul as we watched far up in the skies
2401,NEW YORK,The just-seen worker wave and the slab of marble rise
2402,NEW YORK,To its place on the fortieth story. Still lit by the sun
2403,NEW YORK,Is the face of the golden clock when the toil of the day is done.
2404,NEW YORK,Then the long gray miles are a-murmur and the builders
2405,NEW YORK,"come down from the sky,"
2406,NEW YORK,"And Speed throws her myriad shuttles and the ambulance hurries by,"
2407,NEW YORK,"And the foam of the evening papers is white on the living sea,"
2408,NEW YORK,"And the deep defiles are black with men as far as the eye can see,"
2409,NEW YORK,"And loaded trains rush north and west from thy mighty central heart,"
2410,NEW YORK,And the rivers foam and the bridges sag till their strong
2411,NEW YORK,"steel cables start,"
2412,NEW YORK,And the Rock drinks in its thousands from the moving flood in the street
2413,NEW YORK,As the strong male tide goes out with the roar of a million feet.
2414,NEW YORK,I know when the night comes down that a beautiful Siren awakes.
2415,NEW YORK,I have seen the flash of her eyes and the light that her shadow makes
2416,NEW YORK,On the rain-wet Avenue when the flutes of pleasure are heard
2417,NEW YORK,And she dances her way to the wine cup and sings like a bird.
2418,NEW YORK,"Hand in hand go the sons of Youth and the daughters of Beauty divine,"
2419,NEW YORK,And the children of Hunger are there who have trodden the
2420,NEW YORK,"grapes of their wine,"
2421,NEW YORK,"And the thousands pour and pour through the huge illumined Fair,"
2422,NEW YORK,And the booths of a hundred lands are bright and the
2423,NEW YORK,Wonder-worker is there.
2424,NEW YORK,"The red star is out on the roof and the horses are off on the wall,"
2425,NEW YORK,"And the girl and the dog are blown along and the flashing water fall,"
2426,NEW YORK,"And the flush of thy far-flung revel goes up to the ribbons of sky,"
2427,NEW YORK,And forgotten Orion sinks down and the Pleiades die.
2428,NEW YORK,I have trailed down the pleasant river; I have tramped where
2429,NEW YORK,the iron “L’s”
2430,NEW YORK,Go thundering down through the haunts of care; I have slummed
2431,NEW YORK,through the hidden hells;
2432,NEW YORK,I have jostled the mingling Bowery where the stream of the races rolls;
2433,NEW YORK,I know the town where the yellow man goes by on his velvet soles;
2434,NEW YORK,"I have threaded the still, dark canyons where the clustered towers rise;"
2435,NEW YORK,Not a foot is heard of the thousands; they are ghosts on the
2436,NEW YORK,midnight skies;
2437,NEW YORK,I have seen o’er the glamour of waters thy piles upon shadowy piles
2438,NEW YORK,Standing out on the canvas of night and twinkling for miles upon miles.
2439,NEW YORK,"As a grail is the gleam of thy towers and the glow of the Great White Way,"
2440,NEW YORK,And a thousand ships have sailed and sailed to the lure of
2441,NEW YORK,"the lights on the Bay,"
2442,NEW YORK,"And the spell of thy song, O Enchantress, is sweet on the southern air,"
2443,NEW YORK,And the shepherd far out on the plains feels the sting of thy hair.
2444,NEW YORK,"Thou art young with the youth of them, strong with the strength"
2445,NEW YORK,"of them, filled with the beauty of girls;"
2446,NEW YORK,Thy throat where the River gleams is beaded with lamps as with pearls;
2447,NEW YORK,"And the languor of night is around thee and the waters rise and fall,"
2448,NEW YORK,"And over invisible bridges slow fireworms crawl,"
2449,NEW YORK,"And the Ferries that glide o’er the bay, o’er the rivers that lave"
2450,NEW YORK,"The feet of thy emerald towers, are lighted swans on the wave,"
2451,NEW YORK,"As Merlin had walked o’er thy waters, or Prospero’s eye"
2452,NEW YORK,"Were watching alternate old cities line out on the sky,"
2453,NEW YORK,"One moment Jerusalem gleams and thy towers are holy and white,"
2454,NEW YORK,"And lo, at the turn of a glass, old Babylon etched on the night"
2455,NEW YORK,With high summer gardens abloom and the wealth of the world in her hair;
2456,NEW YORK,Then Carnival laughs in thy streets and Cairo is there
2457,NEW YORK,Barbaric all over with brooches and fountains of fire
2458,NEW YORK,Till the new day quenches the lamps and flares over Tyre.

2574,WE DEAD,
2575,WE DEAD,"Lo, then, the mother eternal!"
2576,WE DEAD,"In my opening soul the footfall of her fleeting tread,"
2577,WE DEAD,"And the song of her voice piercing and sweet with love of me,"
2578,WE DEAD,"And the enwinding of her arms and adoring of her breath,"
2579,WE DEAD,And the milk of her plenty!
2580,WE DEAD,"Oh, Life, of which I am part--Life, from the depths of the heavens,"

2608,GOD AND THE FARMER,Deep bosoms marked with mire.

2610,GOD AND THE FARMER,"The dark, mysterious mold,"
2611,GOD AND THE FARMER,Where the furrow it turned had heaved the new
2612,GOD AND THE FARMER,O’er the chill and churlish old.
2613,GOD AND THE FARMER,
2614,GOD AND THE FARMER,Jehovah’s face was seen not
2615,GOD AND THE FARMER,By ox or grazing kine;
2616,GOD AND THE FARMER,"But the farmer’s eyes, were they dazed with sun,"
2617,GOD AND THE FARMER,Or saw he that look divine?
2618,GOD AND THE FARMER,Was it the wind in passing
2619,GOD AND THE FARMER,That stroked that farmer’s hair?
2620,GOD AND THE FARMER,Or had God’s own hand of wind and flame
2621,GOD AND THE FARMER,Laid benediction there?
2622,GOD AND THE FARMER,

2624,GOD AND THE FARMER,"Far calls of greeting blew,"
2625,GOD AND THE FARMER,Where on sounding plains the lords of war
2626,GOD AND THE FARMER,Hurled down to rear anew.
2627,GOD AND THE FARMER,Glad hail from nation-builders
2628,GOD AND THE FARMER,"Crossed faint those dreamland bounds,"
2629,GOD AND THE FARMER,Like a brother’s cry from a distant hill.
2630,GOD AND THE FARMER,And God spake as the pine-tree sounds.
2631,GOD AND THE FARMER,
2632,GOD AND THE FARMER,“There are seven downy meadows
2633,GOD AND THE FARMER,That never before were mown;
2634,GOD AND THE FARMER,There were seven fields of brush and rock
2635,GOD AND THE FARMER,Where now is nor bush nor stone.
2636,GOD AND THE FARMER,There are seven heifers grazing
2637,GOD AND THE FARMER,Where but one could graze before.
2638,GOD AND THE FARMER,O lords of marts--and of broken hearts--
2639,GOD AND THE FARMER,What have you given me more?”
2640,GOD AND THE FARMER,
2641,GOD AND THE FARMER,God rose up from the farmer
2642,GOD AND THE FARMER,When the cool of the evening neared;
2643,GOD AND THE FARMER,"And the One went forth through the worlds He built,"
2644,GOD AND THE FARMER,And the one through the fields he cleared.
2645,GOD AND THE FARMER,The stars outlasting labor
2646,GOD AND THE FARMER,Leaned down o’er the flowering soil;
2647,GOD AND THE FARMER,And all night long o’er His child there leaned
2648,GOD AND THE FARMER,A Toiler more old than toil.

2742,THE TWO FLAMES,THE TWO FLAMES
2743,THE TWO FLAMES,
2744,THE TWO FLAMES,
2745,THE TWO FLAMES,Behind my mask of life there lies a shrine
2746,THE TWO FLAMES,Wherein two flames are burning. Day and night
2747,THE TWO FLAMES,"I tend these leaping treasures that are mine,"
2748,THE TWO FLAMES,"These lambent loves, the red one and the white,"
2749,THE TWO FLAMES,"While, priestess-like, I hang at either glow,"
2750,THE TWO FLAMES,For each is perfect. And to each I bring
2751,THE TWO FLAMES,"The oil of pure emotion, hottest so,"
2752,THE TWO FLAMES,And draw new strength from my own offering.
2753,THE TWO FLAMES,
2754,THE TWO FLAMES,The first of these my loves burns as a star
2755,THE TWO FLAMES,"That lifts its keen, white glory into space"
2756,THE TWO FLAMES,"With virgin fervor, lavishing afar"
2757,THE TWO FLAMES,Its vivid purity: and in the face
2758,THE TWO FLAMES,Of changeful worlds it glows unaltered still.
2759,THE TWO FLAMES,So burns my flame of friendship. In its sight
2760,THE TWO FLAMES,All things are silvered with a new delight
2761,THE TWO FLAMES,"And beauty’s self strikes deeper, till the thrill"
2762,THE TWO FLAMES,Of mere existence vibrates like a string.
2763,THE TWO FLAMES,"Then life is grown so taut that it must sing,"
2764,THE TWO FLAMES,And all the little hills must clap their hands.
2765,THE TWO FLAMES,The soul is free as never bird on wing
2766,THE TWO FLAMES,To bathe in friendship like a sea of light:
2767,THE TWO FLAMES,And ever as it mounts the sea expands
2768,THE TWO FLAMES,"In new infinities, and each new height"
2769,THE TWO FLAMES,"Grows keener than the last, until the mind"
2770,THE TWO FLAMES,For very dizziness sweeps downward then
2771,THE TWO FLAMES,"To simpler things, the cadence of a voice,"
2772,THE TWO FLAMES,"Or sweet, low laughter, idle as the wind,"
2773,THE TWO FLAMES,Or fleeting touch of hands that quick rejoice
2774,THE TWO FLAMES,But ask no more and do not touch again.
2775,THE TWO FLAMES,"With this white flame there comes a strange new peace,"
2776,THE TWO FLAMES,"A deep tranquillity unknown beside,"
2777,THE TWO FLAMES,Where all my life’s cross-currents shift and cease
2778,THE TWO FLAMES,Like runways in the sand before the tide.
2779,THE TWO FLAMES,"And all that I have longed to be, the brave"
2780,THE TWO FLAMES,High dreams of youth that languished nigh forgot
2781,THE TWO FLAMES,Seem half accomplished. Easy now to slave
2782,THE TWO FLAMES,"At tasks colossal, so my friend fail not."
2783,THE TWO FLAMES,And I am filled with gentle wonderment
2784,THE TWO FLAMES,That life can be so good and breath so sweet:
2785,THE TWO FLAMES,While all my world grows suddenly complete.
2786,THE TWO FLAMES,That I must love it with a new content.
2787,THE TWO FLAMES,"So speech grows overfull, and we are fain"
2788,THE TWO FLAMES,To drink of silence like a golden cup
2789,THE TWO FLAMES,With wine of sweet companionship filled up
2790,THE TWO FLAMES,"That has no end, nor any thirst can drain."
2791,THE TWO FLAMES,And so at last no wish is left to me
2792,THE TWO FLAMES,Save thus to dream into eternity.
2793,THE TWO FLAMES,This is my first white love.
2794,THE TWO FLAMES,
2795,THE TWO FLAMES,The second flame
2796,THE TWO FLAMES,"Burns red and fierce as noon-time on the earth,"
2797,THE TWO FLAMES,"A wild, full-blooded love that sprang to birth"
2798,THE TWO FLAMES,"Naked and unafraid, yet scorning shame"
2799,THE TWO FLAMES,And clean as winds that sweep the desert’s breast.
2800,THE TWO FLAMES,"My flame of passion this, born of the sun"
2801,THE TWO FLAMES,"And warm red earth, so æon-long ago,"
2802,THE TWO FLAMES,"In languid, throbbing noons, when dust was pressed"
2803,THE TWO FLAMES,"To amorous dust, and longing made it one."
2804,THE TWO FLAMES,"This is a good love too, and must be so,"
2805,THE TWO FLAMES,"Though bloodless fathers crushed it and denied,"
2806,THE TWO FLAMES,And on a cross of virtue crucified
2807,THE TWO FLAMES,This firm sweet flesh that colors with our soul.
2808,THE TWO FLAMES,"Aye! it is good, and beautiful, and clean,"
2809,THE TWO FLAMES,To feel within my veins the surge and flow
2810,THE TWO FLAMES,"Of young desire waking, that the whole"
2811,THE TWO FLAMES,"Warm universe has felt: to call, and preen,"
2812,THE TWO FLAMES,And dance before my mate that he may know
2813,THE TWO FLAMES,"An answering surge, and leap, and make me his"
2814,THE TWO FLAMES,And glad with every fecund thing that is.
2815,THE TWO FLAMES,"God! It is good to feel the primal cry,"
2816,THE TWO FLAMES,"The deep, mad longing for another life,--"
2817,THE TWO FLAMES,"My life and his, that shall be born of me,--"
2818,THE TWO FLAMES,"A little child of flame, that when we die"
2819,THE TWO FLAMES,"We may cheat time, nor perish in the strife:"
2820,THE TWO FLAMES,But in this hour of vital ecstasy
2821,THE TWO FLAMES,"When life is molten, we may stamp thereon"
2822,THE TWO FLAMES,"Our own glad image, and conceive, and live."
2823,THE TWO FLAMES,"And sweet it is, and languid, when the tide"
2824,THE TWO FLAMES,"Has ebbed, for lack of more than I can give,"
2825,THE TWO FLAMES,To take his hand who breathes so close beside
2826,THE TWO FLAMES,"And lay it on my breast, and humble me"
2827,THE TWO FLAMES,To say: “Thou art my lord. Thy will my own.”
2828,THE TWO FLAMES,"So at the last this wish is mine, to be"
2829,THE TWO FLAMES,"Struck at the high-tide into nothingness,"
2830,THE TWO FLAMES,"To die, ere he can learn to love me less."
2831,THE TWO FLAMES,
2832,THE TWO FLAMES,"So these my loves are perfect, each alone"
2833,THE TWO FLAMES,"Sufficient in itself and all complete,"
2834,THE TWO FLAMES,"Yet one of two, like rival beacons shown,"
2835,THE TWO FLAMES,"That call and call me, but that never meet."
2836,THE TWO FLAMES,"For yet they have not met, nor ever burned"
2837,THE TWO FLAMES,"The white flame in the red, the red in white"
2838,THE TWO FLAMES,"Till both were wed together there, and turned"
2839,THE TWO FLAMES,To some half-dreamed intensity of light.
2840,THE TWO FLAMES,
2841,THE TWO FLAMES,"For I have dreamed,--yes, in my priestess soul"
2842,THE TWO FLAMES,The longing grows for one great altar fire
2843,THE TWO FLAMES,"That shall leap up to heaven, a winged desire,"
2844,THE TWO FLAMES,"Not two but one, a perfect, living whole."
2845,THE TWO FLAMES,Is this a dream? Are all great lovers dreams?
2846,THE TWO FLAMES,"Can red and white be fused, or two be one?"
2847,THE TWO FLAMES,"Yseult and Eloise, are they but themes"
2848,THE TWO FLAMES,Whereon men hang the yearnings they have spun?
2849,THE TWO FLAMES,And must I cherish so till the end’s end
2850,THE TWO FLAMES,"My sweet loves sundered, lover here, or friend?"
2851,THE TWO FLAMES,"Nay, I know not! I guard by day and night"
2852,THE TWO FLAMES,"My leaping flames, the red one and the white."

3435,ROMANCE,
3436,ROMANCE,"The last farewells were said, friends hurried ashore,--"
3437,ROMANCE,"The screw threshed foam, and jarred; the pier slid by;"
3438,ROMANCE,"Hands went to ears to still the siren’s roar,"
3439,ROMANCE,"Handkerchiefs waved, and there was call and cry;"
3440,ROMANCE,"Over it all, austere and pure and high,"
3441,ROMANCE,"Glittering snow and gold, the towers looked down,--"
3442,ROMANCE,"Serene and cold, regardless of the town."
3443,ROMANCE,
3444,ROMANCE,The wind blew north; and gravely on it came
3445,ROMANCE,"The trolling of the Metropolitan bells,"
3446,ROMANCE,"First the four chimes, softly as puffs of flame,"
3447,ROMANCE,"Then the deep five ... Slow, gentle gleaming swells"
3448,ROMANCE,"Came glancing in the sun, with ocean smells,"
3449,ROMANCE,Up from the harbor and the further sea;
3450,ROMANCE,"Over the stern poised white gulls, giddily."
3451,ROMANCE,
3452,ROMANCE,"Over the stern they poised and dipped and glanced,"
3453,ROMANCE,"Now dull in shade, now shining in bright sun,"
3454,ROMANCE,"And one youth watched them as they whirled and danced,"
3455,ROMANCE,"And noticed how they circled, one by one;"
3456,ROMANCE,"To have those wings, that freedom,--God, what fun!--"
3457,ROMANCE,"And watching them he felt youth in him, strong,"
3458,ROMANCE,"Wings in his blood, and in his heart a song."
3459,ROMANCE,
3460,ROMANCE,"Autumn! Already now the keen wind nipped,"
3461,ROMANCE,"The skies arched cold bright blue, the leaves were turning;"
3462,ROMANCE,Whitely over the waves the cold squalls whipped;
3463,ROMANCE,"Scarlet and pale, the maple trees were burning,"
3464,ROMANCE,"Tossing in gusts, and whirling and returning,"
3465,ROMANCE,"On Staten Island, wonderfully afire;"
3466,ROMANCE,"In bacchic song they flamed, with mad desire."
3467,ROMANCE,
3468,ROMANCE,"Autumn! bringing to old adventures death,"
3469,ROMANCE,"Sadness at all things past, things passing still,"
3470,ROMANCE,"Touching all earth with strange and mystic breath,"
3471,ROMANCE,Veiling all earth in fire ere winter kill;
3472,ROMANCE,Even this youth felt now his deep heart fill
3473,ROMANCE,"With a grey tide of mystery and sadness,"
3474,ROMANCE,Poignant sorrow for all past hours of gladness....
3475,ROMANCE,
3476,ROMANCE,Those times--would others come as keen as they?
3477,ROMANCE,Was life to come as living as life past?--
3478,ROMANCE,"Ah, he was youth, life could not say him nay,--"
3479,ROMANCE,"The blood sang swift in him, doubt could not last;"
3480,ROMANCE,Let all life dead beneath his feet be cast
3481,ROMANCE,"And he would trample it, divinely singing:"
3482,ROMANCE,"Life lay before, more rapturous music bringing!"
3483,ROMANCE,
3484,ROMANCE,"More lusts, more shining eyes, more dizzy laughter,"
3485,ROMANCE,"More, madder music, flute and violin,"
3486,ROMANCE,"With drums before and roses showered after,"
3487,ROMANCE,Always in new bliss drowning his old sin;
3488,ROMANCE,Sin?--Was it that?--And straight in merry din
3489,ROMANCE,Of song and shout and laugh this thought was lost;
3490,ROMANCE,"It was no sin to live, whate’er the cost!..."
3491,ROMANCE,
3492,ROMANCE,"High overhead the Brooklyn bridges passed,"
3493,ROMANCE,"Span upon span and rumorous with cars,"
3494,ROMANCE,"Their shadows on the deck a moment cast,"
3495,ROMANCE,With dizzy thunder from their traffic’s wars;
3496,ROMANCE,"Those grey stone piers would soon be crowned with stars,--"
3497,ROMANCE,Even now their brows were soft with waning sun;
3498,ROMANCE,The homeward march of armies was begun.
3499,ROMANCE,
3500,ROMANCE,"Good-bye, old bridges! And New York, good-bye!"
3501,ROMANCE,Northward the engines took him; now no more
3502,ROMANCE,His gaze hung here; he watched the western sky
3503,ROMANCE,Blazing with vision-isles and faery shore;
3504,ROMANCE,Northward the vibrant ship beneath him bore;
3505,ROMANCE,"The Sound spread out before them, wide and blue,"
3506,ROMANCE,Clean came the wind whereon the sea-gulls flew....
3507,ROMANCE,
3508,ROMANCE,"Soft fields, the flaming trees, a twilight farm ..."
3509,ROMANCE,"New York was gone. He drew deep breaths of air,"
3510,ROMANCE,"Keen as keen fire it was; then slow and calm,"
3511,ROMANCE,"He turned to walk ... when lo, a girl came there,"
3512,ROMANCE,"Deep sunset in her eyes and on her hair,"
3513,ROMANCE,"Her white dress clinging to her knees, one hand"
3514,ROMANCE,Rising to shade her blue eyes; as she scanned
3515,ROMANCE,
3516,ROMANCE,"The swiftly gliding shore, the passing ships,"
3517,ROMANCE,"The bell-buoys, bobbing and tolling in the tide...."
3518,ROMANCE,"A moment, breath hung lifeless on his lips,"
3519,ROMANCE,His heart froze quiet; no one was at her side;
3520,ROMANCE,"Faintly, he smiled; he thought her eyes replied,"
3521,ROMANCE,"Remote lights meeting in them,--quickening;"
3522,ROMANCE,"He passed, and all his body seemed to sing...."
3523,ROMANCE,
3524,ROMANCE,"He passed, then turned; and, as he turned, she turned,--"
3525,ROMANCE,"Her eyes met his eyes shyly, then again"
3526,ROMANCE,"She looked away, and all her soft face burned,"
3527,ROMANCE,And all her virgin heart was big with pain.
3528,ROMANCE,From the saloon below came soft a strain
3529,ROMANCE,"Of some new rag-time, bidding feet to move,"
3530,ROMANCE,"Imploring hands to cling, young hearts to love...."
3531,ROMANCE,
3532,ROMANCE,"Sweetly it came, seductive, soft bizarre,"
3533,ROMANCE,"Huddled and breathless now, now note by note"
3534,ROMANCE,"Crying its separate pain ... now near, now far ..."
3535,ROMANCE,Mingled with all the throbbing of the boat.
3536,ROMANCE,"How beautiful! the first star came, to float"
3537,ROMANCE,"Impalpable in dusk, low in the east;"
3538,ROMANCE,It seemed to sing on when the music ceased.
3539,ROMANCE,
3540,ROMANCE,"Herald of love, lo, love itself it seemed,"
3541,ROMANCE,Singing into the twilight of her soul....
3542,ROMANCE,How beautiful!... across dark waters gleamed
3543,ROMANCE,"Red lights and green, she heard a bell-buoy toll"
3544,ROMANCE,Suddenly caught in the after-wash’s roll;
3545,ROMANCE,A smell of autumn fires came down the wind;
3546,ROMANCE,Beauty so keen it seemed it must have sinned....
3547,ROMANCE,
3548,ROMANCE,"What was this night, what did it bring to her,"
3549,ROMANCE,What flower unfolded in its darkness now?
3550,ROMANCE,"She was this night; she felt her deep soul stir,"
3551,ROMANCE,The slow strange stir of blossoms in the bough....
3552,ROMANCE,How beautiful! She watched the forefoot plough
3553,ROMANCE,"Sheer through the foaming black, the white waves gliding"
3554,ROMANCE,"Dizzily past, now swelling, now subsiding...."
3555,ROMANCE,
3556,ROMANCE,"O Youth, O music, O sweet wizardry"
3557,ROMANCE,Of young life sung like fire through beating veins!
3558,ROMANCE,O covering darkness and persuasive sea!
3559,ROMANCE,"O night of stars, of blisses and of pains!"
3560,ROMANCE,"But most, O Youth, that but an hour remains,--"
3561,ROMANCE,"Be fierce, be sweet with us before you go;"
3562,ROMANCE,"For, knowing you, the best of life we know."
3563,ROMANCE,
3564,ROMANCE,Enchanted so she watched dark waters slipping
3565,ROMANCE,"Swiftly and dizzily past the sheer black side,"
3566,ROMANCE,Watched the fierce wind in sudden flurries whipping
3567,ROMANCE,"The torn spray from the waves, against the tide;"
3568,ROMANCE,"High among stars she saw the mast-head glide,--"
3569,ROMANCE,"Steadily now, now swinging slowly, slightly,"
3570,ROMANCE,There the high mast-head lantern burning brightly....
3571,ROMANCE,
3572,ROMANCE,"O Youth, O music, O sweet wizardy,--"
3573,ROMANCE,O covering darkness of mysterious night!--
3574,ROMANCE,"She turned; along the dark deck, quietly,"
3575,ROMANCE,He came again; an open door shed light
3576,ROMANCE,"Strongly across him for a space, then fright"
3577,ROMANCE,"Suddenly set her wild heart beating, beating,--"
3578,ROMANCE,Suddenly set her endlessly repeating
3579,ROMANCE,
3580,ROMANCE,“I mustn’t speak! I mustn’t speak!”--And then
3581,ROMANCE,"He stood beside her, close and warm and strong,"
3582,ROMANCE,"And she knew sudden the beauty that’s in men,"
3583,ROMANCE,And all her blood flew musical with song....
3584,ROMANCE,"“--Beautiful, isn’t it?--Have you known it long?”--"
3585,ROMANCE,"Calmly he looked at her, and gently spoke."
3586,ROMANCE,"She nodded, lightly; then the warm words broke"
3587,ROMANCE,
3588,ROMANCE,"Easily, quickly, fervently from her heart,"
3589,ROMANCE,"All the restraint of all her youth was gone,"
3590,ROMANCE,She felt a thousand warm new instincts start
3591,ROMANCE,"Out of her soul, birds taking wing with dawn,"
3592,ROMANCE,"Singing their hearts out ... With a deep breath drawn,"
3593,ROMANCE,"“Yes! I’ve known it for years, and loved it, too;"
3594,ROMANCE,Beautiful!--This--is this the first for you?”
3595,ROMANCE,
3596,ROMANCE,"They talked, in low tones; and the sound of sea,"
3597,ROMANCE,"Falling of foam and swish of dropping spray,"
3598,ROMANCE,"Encircled them with song, incessantly;--"
3599,ROMANCE,"They felt alone, the world seemed far away."
3600,ROMANCE,They two! they two! so seemed the night to say;
3601,ROMANCE,A darkness and a stealing fragrance came
3602,ROMANCE,"Spreading through all their souls, silent as flame...."
3603,ROMANCE,
3604,ROMANCE,"O beauty of being a living thing, she thought,--"
3605,ROMANCE,"Of drawing breath beneath these stars, this sky!--"
3606,ROMANCE,"O beautiful fire that from his eyes she caught,"
3607,ROMANCE,"That made her breath rise quick, her lips burn dry!"
3608,ROMANCE,"What was this thing? Dread came, she scarce knew why,--"
3609,ROMANCE,Impulsively she went; yet she had given
3610,ROMANCE,"Her word to dine with him, her earth was heaven."
3611,ROMANCE,
3612,ROMANCE,"He watched her go, and smiled,--her white dress blowing,"
3613,ROMANCE,"Softly in dark,--so young, so sweet, so brave!"
3614,ROMANCE,"She was so pure! by God, there was no knowing,--"
3615,ROMANCE,"And he had half a mind, still, to behave...."
3616,ROMANCE,"No, though: far better take what fortune gave,--"
3617,ROMANCE,Dance to the music that was played for him;
3618,ROMANCE,"Smiling he mused of her, his eyes grew dim,--"
3619,ROMANCE,
3620,ROMANCE,"And he could feel her warmness by his side,"
3621,ROMANCE,And all his body flushed with sweet desire
3622,ROMANCE,"To take her shining loveliness for bride,"
3623,ROMANCE,"To kiss, to fuse with her in single fire...."
3624,ROMANCE,"O youth, O young heart musical as a lyre!"
3625,ROMANCE,O covering darkness of mysterious night!
3626,ROMANCE,He knew these things; his heart was filled with light....
3627,ROMANCE,
3628,ROMANCE,"What was one more? Pah, how he scorned this qualm!"
3629,ROMANCE,Innocent? Such girls seem--but never are.
3630,ROMANCE,"No, he was not her first.... And cold and calm"
3631,ROMANCE,He turned and sought the brightly-lighted bar....
3632,ROMANCE,"The music rose, through shut doors, faint and far,"
3633,ROMANCE,Wailful.... Down in her stateroom mirror there
3634,ROMANCE,"A young girl eyed herself, with frightened stare."
3635,ROMANCE,
3636,ROMANCE,
3637,II,II
3638,II,
3639,II,"She eyed herself with quick breath, frightened stare,"
3640,II,"The fingers of one hand caught at her throat,"
3641,II,And half unconsciously she smoothed her hair....
3642,II,"The music called to her, bizarre, remote...."
3643,II,"On a vast hurrying tide she seemed afloat,"
3644,II,"Hurrying through a darkness downward ever,"
3645,II,"Starless, along some subterranean river...."
3646,II,
3647,II,Where was she going? Where was the current taking?
3648,II,"Vaguely she knew that it would lead to pain,"
3649,II,"To a dark endless pain her deep heart breaking,"
3650,II,To a grey world forever dulled with rain....
3651,II,"And yet she knew this would not come again,"
3652,II,"And all the sweet bliss came imploring, pleading,"
3653,II,"Melting her soul, bruising her heart to bleeding...."
3654,II,
3655,II,"O God, she did not know!--Yet future sorrow"
3656,II,"Seemed somehow paid for by this instant bliss,"
3657,II,A brief to-day was worth a long to-morrow;
3658,II,"O youth, O night,--this joy she dared not miss!"
3659,II,"Her whole soul yearned for this young lover’s kiss,"
3660,II,Though it be paid for through eternity.
3661,II,"O, had not God designed this thing to be?"
3662,II,
3663,II,"Was not her mouth for this young mouth intended,"
3664,II,Since all her living body told her so?
3665,II,Was it not preordained that so be ended
3666,II,A girlhood colder than December snow?
3667,II,A starlight kiss--she need no further go--:
3668,II,His warm hands touching hers: O was this sin?
3669,II,Just this?--She shut her eyes to fires within....
3670,II,
3671,II,"To those fierce central fires she closed her eyes,"
3672,II,"Yet dimly of their passion was aware,"
3673,II,And felt their flames like drunkenness arise
3674,II,"Whirling her soul, making life strangely fair...."
3675,II,"She eyed herself with held breath, frightened stare...."
3676,II,"Alas, was it the alchemy of sin"
3677,II,That made her lovelier far than e’er she’d been?
3678,II,
3679,II,"Plausibly sweet the music came to her,"
3680,II,"Through many doors, most plausible and sweet,"
3681,II,"Setting some subtle pulse in her astir,"
3682,II,Smoothing in song her heart’s erratic beat.
3683,II,"Dizziness came, unstrung her knees, her feet,"
3684,II,"And she sank down a space upon her bed,"
3685,II,"Shutting her eyes, mad reelings in her head."
3686,II,
3687,II,"How would this end? And would her whole life change,"
3688,II,Swayed by this mastering sun as sways the moon?
3689,II,"Would all her way of life be new and strange,"
3690,II,"Her friends be lost, her kin desert her soon?"
3691,II,"Passion surged up in her, and in its swoon"
3692,II,"These doubts were swept aside, obscure and fleeting;"
3693,II,Somewhere she heard a beating ... beating ... beating....
3694,II,
3695,II,"Was it her heart, the loud pulse in her ear,"
3696,II,"Or music, some recurring undertone?--"
3697,II,"The drums perhaps.... She raised her head to hear,"
3698,II,The beating ceased.... Only the tireless drone
3699,II,"Of toiling engines, and the sea’s hushed moan"
3700,II,Soft through the fast-shut port ... and that was all.
3701,II,Steps passed and re-passed down the muffled hall.
3702,II,
3703,II,Steps passed and re-passed on the deck above
3704,II,Ringing like iron.... The curtains by her bed
3705,II,"Quivered forever to the engine’s move,"
3706,II,And from the lamp a quivering light was shed.
3707,II,"These senseless things, when all her life was dead,"
3708,II,"Would still go on: steps pass, the curtains quiver,"
3709,II,"These things or others,--they would last forever."
3710,II,
3711,II,"Quickly she rose, and in the mirror’s shine"
3712,II,Looked at herself a quiet moment’s space;
3713,II,It was as if the earth’s autumnal wine
3714,II,"Had touched her soul,--her body had a grace"
3715,II,"That passing life has, lovely was her face"
3716,II,"With a strange loveliness, and in her eyes"
3717,II,Was the deep glory of October skies.
3718,II,
3719,II,She was alive! her blood flew warm and young;
3720,II,"No more than this she knew, that she was fair;"
3721,II,And happiness through her deep heart was sung;
3722,II,Passionate joy as light as flame in air;
3723,II,"O youth! O love, oblivious of all care!"
3724,II,"O lithe swift-blooded youth, O rose of earth,"
3725,II,O warm-eyed loveliness of fragrant mirth!--
3726,II,
3727,II,"Giddy, with whirling thoughts, she left her room;"
3728,II,"And down the corridor, with fainting feet,"
3729,II,"Lightly she went, caught onward to sweet doom,"
3730,II,And only heard her heart’s loud tremulous beat;
3731,II,"Through opening doors, most plausible, most sweet,"
3732,II,"The music rose to her; and he stood there,"
3733,II,"Smiling, in all that noise and whir and glare...."
3734,II,
3735,II,"Over the shining silver, sparkling glass,"
3736,II,"The smooth white table-cloth, he leaned and smiled;"
3737,II,"The whole world vanished, they were lad and lass,"
3738,II,"In love, and face to face, hearts running wild."
3739,II,Deep in her eyes he looked: O what a child!
3740,II,"Her soft breast rose and fell, her throat’s pure white"
3741,II,Beat with a little pulse of joy and fright.
3742,II,
3743,II,"No need to talk.... For in their eyes they met,"
3744,II,"Treading an air so soft, so light, so fine,"
3745,II,"That they were speechless, words they could forget;"
3746,II,"They only smiled, and shyly sipped their wine,"
3747,II,"And smiled again, and felt their full hearts shine,"
3748,II,"Talked breathlessly a little, and longed to lean"
3749,II,"Nearer, more near,--till no mote lay between,--"
3750,II,
3751,II,"Not light or darkness, world or heaven or star,"
3752,II,"Not wind, nor warm, nor cold ... but just they two"
3753,II,"Meeting at last, two spirits come from far,"
3754,II,"Face raised to face, white flowers made sweet with dew,--"
3755,II,"Shining and passionate, and young and new,--"
3756,II,"Their two warm bodies singing each to each,"
3757,II,Mingling at last in love’s harmonious speech....
3758,II,
3759,II,"The lights, the noise, the tumult passed away;"
3760,II,As in a dream without a sound they passed;
3761,II,"She only knew that it was wildly gay,"
3762,II,"And shy, and bliss unbearable.... At last"
3763,II,Under the high dark starward-gliding mast
3764,II,In grateful night they sat; he brought her coat
3765,II,And trembling wrapped the scarf around her throat;
3766,II,
3767,II,"Letting his fingers linger there a space,"
3768,II,"Longer than there was need, so sweet she smiled,"
3769,II,So close they were to that soft wistful face....
3770,II,"The stars looked down upon them, clear and mild...."
3771,II,"Woman and maiden, girl, and little child,--"
3772,II,"She was all these.... A moment, he was shaken,--"
3773,II,"Lest he do wrong, lest he might prove mistaken...."
3774,II,
3775,II,"Only a moment ... passion rose again,"
3776,II,"Quiet he took her hand and held it long,"
3777,II,"And all her virgin heart grew big with pain,"
3778,II,And all her new-born body ached with song.
3779,II,"Blindly she prayed to God to make her strong,--"
3780,II,More blindly cried to earth to make her weak;
3781,II,"And looked at him, near tears, and could not speak."
3782,II,
3783,II,He was a loveliness she could not bear....
3784,II,Like a fierce furnace seemed his beauty now....
3785,II,"A fire that caught her throat, her lips, her hair,"
3786,II,"Her parching eyes, her pained and beating brow."
3787,II,"Only to give herself,--she cared not how.--"
3788,II,"Into the flame, body and soul to fling;"
3789,II,"To have him hurt her,--ah, divinest thing!..."
3790,II,
3791,II,Four bells were struck: ’twas ten o’clock he said;
3792,II,"And still the sea rushed past, under the night."
3793,II,The engines toiled and the great steamer sped;
3794,II,"And they could see the bow-wash, dimly white,"
3795,II,Fall into darkness; the mast-head light
3796,II,"Quivered among the stars, and in its fire"
3797,II,A span of fore-stay shone like golden wire....
3798,II,
3799,II,"Little by little they were left alone,"
3800,II,"The decks were emptied; only, from the bar,"
3801,II,"Came shouts and laughter, and a drunkard’s groan,"
3802,II,"The glasses clinking, and a strummed guitar,"
3803,II,"The door shut, and the sounds grew faint and far,"
3804,II,And all the deck was dark; only the sea
3805,II,"Lifted its great voice, like infinity."
3806,II,
3807,II,"O youth, O music, O sweet wizardy"
3808,II,Of young love sung like fire through beating veins!
3809,II,O covering darkness and persuasive sea!
3810,II,"O night of stars, of blisses and of pains!"
3811,II,"But most, O youth that but an hour remains,--"
3812,II,"Be fierce, be sweet with us, before you go;"
3813,II,For knowing you the best of life we know!
3814,II,
3815,II,"Beneath his kiss her mouth rose soft and warm,"
3816,II,"And dewy soft as rose-leaves were her eyes,"
3817,II,"Under his hands, shaken as with a storm"
3818,II,"He felt her soft breast fall and shudder and rise,"
3819,II,"Torn with impassioned breath, unuttered cries,"
3820,II,"Quivering, straining breast against his breast,"
3821,II,"She clung to him, her mouth on his mouth pressed...."
3822,II,
3823,II,"And only knew that this was life at last,"
3824,II,Forgot all else in agony of bliss;
3825,II,Into this fire of love all earth was cast;
3826,II,"The stars, the sea, were mingled in this kiss."
3827,II,"And through her heart the blood, with sing and hiss,"
3828,II,"Poured a red madness, surged a riotous pain,--"
3829,II,Unbearable music cried out in her brain....

3833,II,"Ah, God have pity! she knew not what to do,"
3834,II,"But sat all quiet,--frozen, shrinking, dumb;"
3835,II,"And only heard the toiling engines hum,"
3836,II,"The rush of sea, the swish of dropping spray,"
3837,II,Her clamorous heart; and all that she could say
3838,II,
3839,II,"Was a quick “yes,” and then a broken breath"
3840,II,"That quivered like a sob; and then she rose,"
3841,II,"Dizzy and weak and pale, like one near death,"
3842,II,"And now her heart was fire, and now it froze...."
3843,II,"Faint in her room she stood; the door to close,--"
3844,II,"She might still turn the key.... She cried a space,--"
3845,II,Long in the glass stared at her pallid face....
3846,II,
3847,II,"And heard a step tramp over the deck above,"
3848,II,Ringing like iron.... The curtains by her bed
3849,II,"Quivered forever to the engine’s move,"
3850,II,And from the lamp a quivering light was shed....
3851,II,These things would all go on when she was dead....
3852,II,"Trembling, with misty eyes, she loosed the pin"
3853,II,Under her throat ... mad fires whirled up within....
3854,II,
3855,II,"Mad fires whirled up, ungulfing all her soul;"
3856,II,"Beyond the sun and stars, across all space,"
3857,II,"Power that earth nor heaven could now control,"
3858,II,"She heard her lover come, with quickening pace;"
3859,II,"Nowhere to hide! Alas, his shining face,"
3860,II,"Though she hid under seas would find her there,"
3861,II,Though she hid under mountains lay her bare!
3862,II,
3863,II,"Across the stars, nearer, more near it came,"
3864,II,"And now earth shook with it, and now the sea,"
3865,II,"And her white body, tremulous with shame,"
3866,II,"From its sheer anguish knew that it was he,--"
3867,II,Yearned for this wonder that was soon to be;
3868,II,"And all her heart made music for his feet,"
3869,II,All of the world re-echoed to their beat....
3870,II,
3871,II,"Marriage of youth! And quick a darkness fell,"
3872,II,"And time and space went down, consumed in fire;"
3873,II,"Through that dark space, only one breath, to tell"
3874,II,"That here was youth, and love, and wild desire:"

3883,III,"With oak-leaves brown, with flaming leaves and pale;"
3884,III,"Mysterious autumn, symbol of all grief,"
3885,III,Symbol of lives that die and hopes that fail:
3886,III,"Now on the threshing-floor has fallen the flail,"
3887,III,The hands are elsewhere that have stored the grain;
3888,III,Now comes the season of snows and bitter rain.
3889,III,
3890,III,Weeks passed.... And then one day there came a note
3891,III,To New York for this youth ... he tore and read.
3892,III,It was that girl he played with on the boat....
3893,III,"Scarcely three shaky lines ... in which she said,"
3894,III,"That she was sick with typhoid, nearly dead,--"
3895,III,"Wanted to say she loved him; then she cried,"
3896,III,"O God, if he would come before she died!--"
3897,III,
3898,III,"Loved him!... a blackness fell; and in his eyes,"
3899,III,"So long unused, and even now ashamed,"
3900,III,He felt the warm tears quickening to rise....
3901,III,Loved him!--he had not known.... Could he be blamed?--
3902,III,"Then a great light of sorrow in him flamed,--"
3903,III,"And bitterness, his sight swam quickly dim,--"
3904,III,Thinking how little it had meant to him!
3905,III,
3906,III,"Scarce knowing why, he packed his things and went...."
3907,III,"He was surprised, on seeing her, to find how lovely she had been,"
3908,III,though pale and spent....
3909,III,"He sat beside her, striving to be kind,"
3910,III,"Stroking her forehead.... Yet, she had divined,"
3911,III,"And known too bitterly, before she died,"
3912,III,"This man had never loved her, but had lied...."
3913,III,
3914,III,And he knew this: he knew that she had known;
3915,III,"In her dark eyes he saw the mastered yearning,"
3916,III,"All the unspoken love that died in moan,"
3917,III,"Shrunk on itself, through all her body burning...."
3918,III,And many days the memory came returning
3919,III,"Of her last kiss,--quivering, wet with tears,--"
3920,III,"Her clinging hands, her brimmed eyes dark with fears...."
3921,III,
3922,III,Until at times a sudden terror came
3923,III,"Lest, through great pity, he should love one dead,--"
3924,III,"So burning sweet recurred in him this shame,"
3925,III,"So haunted him those eyes, that fallen head;"
3926,III,"The lips that pleaded so, the words she said,--"
3927,III,Pathetic words!--these haunted him a space;
3928,III,"Then, in the dark of time he lost her face...."
3929,III,
3930,III,"O Autumn! bringing to old adventures death,"
3931,III,"Sadness at all things past, things passing still,--"
3932,III,You touched this love with strange and dreadful breath;
3933,III,"Easy as leaf is human love to chill,--"
3934,III,Easy as leaf is human to kill;
3935,III,"Yet beautiful is that death with sudden flame,"
3936,III,"Ere it goes down to darkness, whence it came!..."

4262,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4263,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4264,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Here in the lonely chapel I will wait,"
4265,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Here will I rest, if any rest may be;"
4266,ASH WEDNESDAY,"So fair the day is, and the hour so late,"
4267,ASH WEDNESDAY,I shall have few to share the blessed calm with me.
4268,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Calm and soft light, sweet inarticulate calls!"
4269,ASH WEDNESDAY,One shallow dish of eerie golden fire
4270,ASH WEDNESDAY,"By molten chains above the altar swinging,"
4271,ASH WEDNESDAY,Draws my eyes up from the shadowed stalls
4272,ASH WEDNESDAY,To the warm chancel-dome;
4273,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Crag-like the clustered organs loom,"
4274,ASH WEDNESDAY,Yet from their thunder-threatening choir
4275,ASH WEDNESDAY,Flows but a ghostly singing--
4276,ASH WEDNESDAY,Half-human voices reaching home
4277,ASH WEDNESDAY,"In infinite, tremulous surge and falls."
4278,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Light on his stops and keys,"
4279,ASH WEDNESDAY,"And pallor on the player’s face,"
4280,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Who, listening rapt, with finger-skill to seize"
4281,ASH WEDNESDAY,"The pattern of a mood’s elusive grace,"
4282,ASH WEDNESDAY,Captures his spirit in an airy lace
4283,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Of fading, fading harmonies."
4284,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Oh, let your coolness soothe"
4285,ASH WEDNESDAY,"My weariness, frail music, where you keep"
4286,ASH WEDNESDAY,Tryst with the even-fall;
4287,ASH WEDNESDAY,Where tone by tone you find a pathway smooth
4288,ASH WEDNESDAY,"To yonder gleaming cross, or nearer creep"
4289,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Along the bronzèd wall,"
4290,ASH WEDNESDAY,Where shade by shade thro’ deeps of brown
4291,ASH WEDNESDAY,Comes the still twilight down.
4292,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4293,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Wilt thou not rest, my thought?"
4294,ASH WEDNESDAY,Wouldst thou go back to that pain-breeding room
4295,ASH WEDNESDAY,Whence only by strong wrenchings thou wert brought?
4296,ASH WEDNESDAY,"O weary, weary questionings,"
4297,ASH WEDNESDAY,Will ye pursue me to the altar rail
4298,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Where my old faith for sanctuary clings,"
4299,ASH WEDNESDAY,And back again my heart reluctant hale
4300,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Yonder, where crushed against the cheerless wall"
4301,ASH WEDNESDAY,Tiptoe I glimpsed the tier on tier
4302,ASH WEDNESDAY,Of faces unserene and startled eyes--
4303,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Such eyes as on grim surgeon-work are set,"
4304,ASH WEDNESDAY,On desperate outmaneuverings of doom?
4305,ASH WEDNESDAY,Still must I hear
4306,ASH WEDNESDAY,The boding voice with cautious rise and fall
4307,ASH WEDNESDAY,Tracking relentless to its lair
4308,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Each fever-bred progenitor of faith,"
4309,ASH WEDNESDAY,Each fugitive ancestral fear?
4310,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Still must I follow, as the wraith"
4311,ASH WEDNESDAY,Of antique awe toward a wreck-making beach
4312,ASH WEDNESDAY,Drives derelict?
4313,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Nay, rest, rest, my thought,"
4314,ASH WEDNESDAY,Where long-loved sound and shadow teach
4315,ASH WEDNESDAY,Quietness to conscience overwrought.
4316,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4317,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Harken! The choristers, the white-robed priest"
4318,ASH WEDNESDAY,Move thro’ the chapel dim
4319,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Sounding of warfare and the victor’s palm,"
4320,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Of valiant marchings, of the feast"
4321,ASH WEDNESDAY,Spread for the pilgrim in a haven’d calm.
4322,ASH WEDNESDAY,How on the first lips of my steadfast race
4323,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Sounded that battle hymn,"
4324,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Quaint heaven-vauntings, with God’s gauntlet flung,"
4325,ASH WEDNESDAY,"To me bequeathed, from age to age,"
4326,ASH WEDNESDAY,My challenge and my heritage!
4327,ASH WEDNESDAY,“The Lord is in His holy place”--
4328,ASH WEDNESDAY,How in their ears the herald voice has rung!
4329,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Now will I make bright their sword,"
4330,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Will pilgrim in their ancient path,"
4331,ASH WEDNESDAY,Will haunt the temple of their Lord;
4332,ASH WEDNESDAY,Truth that is neither variable nor hath
4333,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Shadow of turning, I will find"
4334,ASH WEDNESDAY,In the wise ploddings of their faithful mind;
4335,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Of finding not, as in this frustrate hour"
4336,ASH WEDNESDAY,"By question hounded, waylaid by despair,"
4337,ASH WEDNESDAY,Yet in these uses shall I know His power
4338,ASH WEDNESDAY,As the warm flesh by breathing knows the air.
4339,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4340,ASH WEDNESDAY,O futile comfort! My faith-hungry heart
4341,ASH WEDNESDAY,Still in your sweetness tastes a poisonous sour;
4342,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Far off, far off I quiver ’neath the smart"
4343,ASH WEDNESDAY,Of old indignities and obscure scorn
4344,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Indelibly on man’s proud spirit laid,"
4345,ASH WEDNESDAY,That now in time’s ironic masquerade
4346,ASH WEDNESDAY,Minister healing to the hurt and worn!
4347,ASH WEDNESDAY,What are those streams that from the altar pour
4348,ASH WEDNESDAY,Where goat and ox and human captive bled
4349,ASH WEDNESDAY,To feed the blood-lust of the murderous priest?
4350,ASH WEDNESDAY,"I cannot see where Christ’s dear love is shed,"
4351,ASH WEDNESDAY,So deep the insatiate horror washes red
4352,ASH WEDNESDAY,Flesh-stains and frenzy-sears and gore.
4353,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Beneath that Cross, whereon His hands outspread,"
4354,ASH WEDNESDAY,What forest shades behold what shameful rites
4355,ASH WEDNESDAY,Of maidenhood surrendered to the beast
4356,ASH WEDNESDAY,In obscene worship on midsummer nights!
4357,ASH WEDNESDAY,What imperturbable disguise
4358,ASH WEDNESDAY,Enwraps these organs with a chaste restraint
4359,ASH WEDNESDAY,To chant innocuous hymns and litanies
4360,ASH WEDNESDAY,"For sinner and adoring saint,"
4361,ASH WEDNESDAY,Which yet inherit like an old blood-taint
4362,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Some naked caperings in the godliest tune,--"
4363,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Goat-songs and jests strong with the breath of Pan,"
4364,ASH WEDNESDAY,That charmed the easy cow-girl and her man
4365,ASH WEDNESDAY,In uncouth tryst beneath a scandalous moon!
4366,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Ah, could I hearken with their trust,"
4367,ASH WEDNESDAY,Or see with their pure-seeing eyes
4368,ASH WEDNESDAY,Who of the frame of these dear mysteries
4369,ASH WEDNESDAY,Were not too wise!
4370,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Why cannot I, as in a stronger hour,"
4371,ASH WEDNESDAY,Outface the horror that defeats me now?
4372,ASH WEDNESDAY,Hare I not reaped complacent the rich power
4373,ASH WEDNESDAY,That harvest from this praise and bowing low?
4374,ASH WEDNESDAY,"On this strong music have I mounted up,"
4375,ASH WEDNESDAY,"At yonder rail broke bread, and shared the holy cup,"
4376,ASH WEDNESDAY,"And on that cross have hung, and felt God’s pain"
4377,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Sorrowing, sorrowing, till the world shall end."
4378,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4379,ASH WEDNESDAY,Not from these forms my questionings come
4380,ASH WEDNESDAY,"That serving truth are purified,"
4381,ASH WEDNESDAY,"But from the truth itself, the way, the goal,"
4382,ASH WEDNESDAY,One challenge vast that strikes faith dumb--
4383,ASH WEDNESDAY,"If truth be fickle, who shall be our guide?"
4384,ASH WEDNESDAY,"“Truth that is neither variable, nor hath"
4385,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Shadow of turning?” Ah, where turns she not!"
4386,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Where yesterday she stood,"
4387,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Now the horizon empties--lo, her steps"
4388,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Where yonder scholar woos, are hardly cold,"
4389,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Yet shall he find her never, but the thought"
4390,ASH WEDNESDAY,Mantling within him like her blood
4391,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Shall from his eloquence fade, and leave his words"
4392,ASH WEDNESDAY,Flavor’d with vacant quaintness for his son.
4393,ASH WEDNESDAY,"What crafty patience, scholar, hast thou used,"
4394,ASH WEDNESDAY,Useless ere it was begun--
4395,ASH WEDNESDAY,"What headless waste of wing,"
4396,ASH WEDNESDAY,Beating vainly round and round!
4397,ASH WEDNESDAY,"In no one Babel were the tongues confused,"
4398,ASH WEDNESDAY,"But they who handle truth, from sound to sound"
4399,ASH WEDNESDAY,Master another speech continuously.
4400,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Deaf to familiar words, our callous ear"
4401,ASH WEDNESDAY,Will quiver to the edge of utterance strange;
4402,ASH WEDNESDAY,"When truth to God’s truth-weary sight draws near,"
4403,ASH WEDNESDAY,Cannot God see her till she suffer change?
4404,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Must ye then change, my vanished youth,"
4405,ASH WEDNESDAY,Home customs of my dreams?
4406,ASH WEDNESDAY,Change and farewell!
4407,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Farewell, your lost phantasmic truth"
4408,ASH WEDNESDAY,"That will not constant dwell,"
4409,ASH WEDNESDAY,But flees the passion of our eyes
4410,ASH WEDNESDAY,And leaves no hint behind her
4411,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Whence she dawns or whither dies,"
4412,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Or if she live at all, or only for a moment seems."
4413,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4414,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Here tho’ I only dream I find her,"
4415,ASH WEDNESDAY,Here will I watch the twilight darken.
4416,ASH WEDNESDAY,Yonder the scholar’s voice spins on
4417,ASH WEDNESDAY,Mesh upon mesh of loveless fate;
4418,ASH WEDNESDAY,Here will I rest while truth deserts him still.
4419,ASH WEDNESDAY,"What hath she left thee, Brother, but thy voice?"
4420,ASH WEDNESDAY,"After her, have thy will,"
4421,ASH WEDNESDAY,And happy be thy choice!
4422,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Here rather will I rest, and harken"
4423,ASH WEDNESDAY,Voices longer dead but longer loved than thine.
4424,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4425,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Yet still my most of peace is more unrest,"
4426,ASH WEDNESDAY,As one who plods a summer road
4427,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Feels the coolness his own motion stirs,"
4428,ASH WEDNESDAY,But when he stops the dead heat smothers him.
4429,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Here in this calm my soul is weariest,"
4430,ASH WEDNESDAY,Each question with malicious goad
4431,ASH WEDNESDAY,Pressing the choice that still my soul defers
4432,ASH WEDNESDAY,"To visioned hours not thus eclipsed and dim,"
4433,ASH WEDNESDAY,Lest in my haste I deem
4434,ASH WEDNESDAY,That truth’s invariable part
4435,ASH WEDNESDAY,Is her eluding of man’s heart.
4436,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Farewell, calm priest who pacest slow"
4437,ASH WEDNESDAY,After the stalwart-marching choir!
4438,ASH WEDNESDAY,Have men thro’ thee taught God their dear desire?
4439,ASH WEDNESDAY,Hath God thro’ thee absolvèd sin?
4440,ASH WEDNESDAY,"What is thy benediction, if I go"
4441,ASH WEDNESDAY,Sore perplexed and wrought within?
4442,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Open the chapel doors, and let"
4443,ASH WEDNESDAY,Boisterous music play us out
4444,ASH WEDNESDAY,Toward the flaring molten west
4445,ASH WEDNESDAY,Whither the nerve-racked day is set;
4446,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Let the loud world, flooding back,"
4447,ASH WEDNESDAY,Gulf us in its hungry rout;
4448,ASH WEDNESDAY,Rest? What part have we in rest?
4449,ASH WEDNESDAY,
4450,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Boy with the happy face and hurrying feet,"
4451,ASH WEDNESDAY,Who with thy friendly cap’s salute
4452,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Sendest bright hail across the college street,"
4453,ASH WEDNESDAY,"If thou couldst see my answering lips, how mute,"
4454,ASH WEDNESDAY,How loth to take thy student courtesy!
4455,ASH WEDNESDAY,What truth have I for thee?
4456,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Rather thy wisdom, lad, impart,"
4457,ASH WEDNESDAY,Share thy gift of strength with me.
4458,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Still with the past I wrestle, but the future girds thy heart."
4459,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Clutter of shriveled yesterdays that clothe us like a shell,"
4460,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Thy spirit sloughs their bondage off, to walk newborn and free."
4461,ASH WEDNESDAY,"All things the human heart hath learned--God, heaven, earth, and hell--"
4462,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Thou weighest not for what they were, but what they still may be."
4463,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Whether the scholar delve and mine for faith-wreck buried deep,"
4464,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Or the priest his rules and holy rites, letter and spirit, keep,"
4465,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Toil or trust in breathless dust, they shall starve at last for truth;"
4466,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Scholar and priest shall live from thee, who art eternal youth."
4467,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Holier if thou dost tread it, every path the prophets trod;"
4468,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Clearer where thou dost worship, rise the ancient hymns to God;"
4469,ASH WEDNESDAY,Not by the priest but by thy prayers are altars sanctified;
4470,ASH WEDNESDAY,"Strong with new love where thou dost kneel, the cross whereon Christ died."

5572,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),
5573,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),
5574,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Within the Jersey City shed
5575,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The engine coughs and shakes its head.
5576,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"The smoke, a plume of red and white,"
5577,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Waves madly in the face of night.
5578,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"And now the grave, incurious stars"
5579,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Gleam on the groaning, hurrying cars."
5580,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Against the kind and awful reign
5581,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Of darkness, this our angry train,"
5582,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"A noisy little rebel, pouts"
5583,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Its brief defiance, flames and shouts--"
5584,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"And passes on, and leaves no trace."

5586,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Serene and absolute, the king"
5587,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Unchanged, of every living thing."
5588,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The houses lie obscure and still
5589,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),In Rutherford and Carlton Hill.
5590,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Our lamps intensify the dark
5591,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Of slumbering Passaic Park.
5592,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),And quiet holds the weary feet
5593,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),That daily tramp through Prospect Street.
5594,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),What though we clang and clank and roar
5595,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Through all Passaic’s streets? No door
5596,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Will open, not an eye will see"
5597,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Who this loud vagabond may be.
5598,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Upon my crimson cushioned seat,"
5599,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"In manufactured light and heat,"
5600,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),I feel unnatural and mean.
5601,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Outside the towns are cool and clean;
5602,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Curtained awhile from sound and sight
5603,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),They take God’s gracious gift of night.
5604,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The stars are watchful over them.
5605,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),On Clifton as on Bethlehem
5606,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"The angels, leaning down the sky,"
5607,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Shed peace and gentled dreams. And I--
5608,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"I ride, I blasphemously ride"
5609,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Through all the silent countryside.
5610,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"The engine’s shriek, the headlight’s glare,"
5611,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Pollute the still nocturnal air.
5612,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The cottages of Lake View sigh
5613,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"And sleeping, frown as we pass by."
5614,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Why, even strident Paterson"
5615,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Rests quietly as any nun.
5616,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Her foolish warring children keep
5617,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The grateful armistice of sleep.
5618,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),For what tremendous errand’s sake
5619,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Are we so blatantly awake?
5620,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),What precious secret is our freight?
5621,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),What king must be abroad so late?
5622,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Perhaps Death roams the hills to-night
5623,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),And we rush forth to give him fight.
5624,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Or else, perhaps, we speed his way"
5625,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),To some remote unthinking prey.
5626,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Perhaps a woman writhes in pain
5627,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),And listens--listens for the train!
5628,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"The train, that like an angel sings,"
5629,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"The train, with healing on its wings."
5630,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Now “Hawthorne!” the conductor cries.
5631,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),My neighbor starts and rubs his eyes.
5632,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),He hurries yawning through the car
5633,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),And steps out where the houses are.
5634,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),This is the reason of our quest!
5635,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Not wantonly we break the rest
5636,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Of town and village, nor do we"
5637,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Lightly profane night’s sanctity.
5638,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"What Love commands the train fulfils,"
5639,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),And beautiful upon the hills
5640,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Are these our feet of burnished steel.
5641,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Subtly and certainly I feel
5642,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),That Glen Rock welcomes us to her
5643,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),And silent Ridgewood seems to stir
5644,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"And smile, because she knows the train"
5645,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Has brought her children back again.
5646,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),We carry people home--and so
5647,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"God speeds us, wheresoe’er we go."
5648,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"Hohokus, Waldwick, Allendale"
5649,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Lift sleepy heads to give us hail.
5650,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"In Ramsey, Mahwah, Suffern, stand"
5651,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),Houses that wistfully demand
5652,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),A father--son--some human thing
5653,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"That this, the midnight train, may bring."
5654,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The trains that travel in the day
5655,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),They hurry folks to work or play.
5656,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),The midnight train is slow and old
5657,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"But of it let this thing be told,"
5658,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),"To its high honor be it said,"
5659,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),It carries people home to bed.
5660,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),My cottage lamp shines white and clear.
5661,(FOR EDWARD J. WHEELER),God bless the train that brought me here!

6086,I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.,Oppenheim sings the joys and sorrows of the race now and to come. The

6093,I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.,Oppenheim’s technical achievement can only be characterized as masterly.
6094,I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.,The volume is the only one in which the use of “polyrhythmic verse” can
6095,I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.,"claim complete justification since _Leaves of Grass_, and its art is as"

6097,I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.,"Whitman, but they do not echo him. The volume will prove more and more"
6098,I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.,satisfying with each rereading. And its message to the American people

6148,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,Professor Dowden as a poet. Those who care for the work of Mr. Woodberry
6149,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,"will find the same qualities in Dowden’s poetry, but in a larger and"

6153,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,"infectious. This is the first edition of his poems since 1876, and"
6154,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,contains many which have never been collected before. The second volume
6155,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,"is a pleasant translation of Goethe’s, _The West Eastern Divan_. It will"

6180,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,"in most poetry of a socialistic tendency, Mr. Kemp has succeeded with"
6181,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,some quiet reserve in making the reader feel the pity of lonely outcast
6182,II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.,"life, and in expressing his philosophy in genuine poetry. The sincerity"

6253,LIBRARY,"* _Earth Triumphant, and Other Tales in Verse. By Conrad Aiken._"
6254,LIBRARY,"(Macmillan: $1.25 net.) Three narrative poems of distinction, followed"
6255,LIBRARY,by shorter poems interpreting the philosophy of youth. They suggest
6256,LIBRARY,"comparison with the longer poems of John Masefield, but have a firm"
6257,LIBRARY,independent technique of their own. With genuine beauty they relate
6258,LIBRARY,"tales which reveal the heart of modern life in various phases of youth,"
6259,LIBRARY,and contain a reading of earth which differs in essentials from that of
6260,LIBRARY,Meredith. The volume deserves a wider audience than the usual public
6261,LIBRARY,which cares for poetry. It has a message which every American will
6262,LIBRARY,"appreciate, and if it helps to spread an interest in poetry among new"
6263,LIBRARY,"circles of readers, it will only be fulfilling its mission. It is a"
6264,LIBRARY,distinguished first book of verse.
6265,LIBRARY,
6266,LIBRARY,_Poems. By Walter Conrad Arensberg._ (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.00 net.) The
6267,LIBRARY,"most artistic volume of poetry this year in its technique. Aloofness,"
6268,LIBRARY,"controlled emotion, conscious art, are the characteristics of his"
6269,LIBRARY,"poetry. Despite an occasional _bizarrerie_, despite echoes of Verlaine"
6270,LIBRARY,"and Laforgue, Mr. Arensberg is a classicist. His technique is faultless."
6271,LIBRARY,"Each line is not only exquisite in itself, but it is perfectly"
6272,LIBRARY,"coördinated with every other line. If these poems leave the reader cold,"
6273,LIBRARY,they offer an abundant intellectual compensation for the “thrills” of
6274,LIBRARY,other poets. The special qualities of his verse are unique in American
6275,LIBRARY,"poetry, and will surely appeal to a discriminating circle, though his"
6276,LIBRARY,work is unlikely to become popular.
6277,LIBRARY,
6278,LIBRARY,_The Minor Poems of Joseph Beaumont. Edited by Eloise Robinson._
6279,LIBRARY,(Houghton-Mifflin: $5.00 net.) An authoritative text of Joseph
6280,LIBRARY,Beaumont’s minor poems edited from a manuscript in the possession of
6281,LIBRARY,Professor George Herbert Palmer. The poems are preceded by a critical
6282,LIBRARY,introduction and followed by a brief but careful textual apparatus.
6283,LIBRARY,"While Beaumont was a very minor poet, the fact remains that he was a"
6284,LIBRARY,significant member of the group of metaphysical poets of whom Vaughan
6285,LIBRARY,"was the greatest, and this volume must take its place in any collection"
6286,LIBRARY,of English poetry which claims to be even reasonably complete.
6287,LIBRARY,
6288,LIBRARY,"_The Falconer of God, and Other Poems. By William Rose Benét._ (Yale"
6289,LIBRARY,University Press: $1.25 net.) Mr. Benét’s second collection marks an
6290,LIBRARY,advance in facility combined with a greater restraint and reticence. It
6291,LIBRARY,"includes many fine ballads, and several dramatic soliloquies only"
6292,LIBRARY,surpassed this year by those in Miss Burr’s new volume. Although there
6293,LIBRARY,"is much which is experimental in the book, it is successful experiment,"
6294,LIBRARY,and Mr. Benét’s range of expression is continually broadening.
6295,LIBRARY,
6296,LIBRARY,* _Auguries. By Laurence Binyon._ (Lane: $1.00 net.) One of the most
6297,LIBRARY,satisfying collections of verse of a noteworthy poet who is too little
6298,LIBRARY,known and appreciated in this country. Its grave classical beauty will
6299,LIBRARY,"never assure it popularity, but at its best it is worthy to stand beside"
6300,LIBRARY,"Mr. Bridges, and it contains no poem that is not excellent. _Ferry"
6301,LIBRARY,Hinksey_ is a lyric which no future anthologist can overlook. Next to
6302,LIBRARY,"Mr. Arensberg’s poems, the most satisfying new volume artistically of"
6303,LIBRARY,the year. It demands silence and complete surrender.
6304,LIBRARY,
6305,LIBRARY,"_Broad-Sheet Ballads. With An Introduction by Padraic Colum._ (Norman,"
6306,LIBRARY,"Remington: $.75 net.) A narrow, but good, selection of the best of the"
6307,LIBRARY,Broad-Sheet Ballads which occupy so definite a place in Irish poetry.
6308,LIBRARY,These waifs and strays have been gathered previously in various
6309,LIBRARY,"collections, but never before in a volume calculated to appeal to the"
6310,LIBRARY,general public. An introduction telling the story of this form of art
6311,LIBRARY,and the characteristics of its audiences and appeal to them is prefixed.
6312,LIBRARY,
6313,LIBRARY,* _Syrinx: Pastels of Hellas. By Mitchell S. Buck._ (Claire-Marie:
6314,LIBRARY,"$1.25 net.) A volume of prose poems of reticent Pagan art, suggestive of"
6315,LIBRARY,"the best work of Pierre Louys. Unique in American poetry, and really"
6316,LIBRARY,beautiful.
6317,LIBRARY,
6318,LIBRARY,_In the High Hills. By Maxwell Struthers Burt._ (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.25
6319,LIBRARY,net.) The verse in this volume is of a kind that has eminent qualities
6320,LIBRARY,without eminent distinction. The earnestness and sincerity of Mr. Burt’s
6321,LIBRARY,poetic moods give to his poetry those sound qualities which at least
6322,LIBRARY,"compel attention, if they do not excite the emotions. The elements of"
6323,LIBRARY,"poetry are not fused with imaginative heat in his work, and hence it"
6324,LIBRARY,"lacks magic, but it reflects the gentlemanly feeling of a lover of"
6325,LIBRARY,poetry in verse which demands respect.
6326,LIBRARY,
6327,LIBRARY,"_The Sun-Thief, and Other Poems. By Rhys Carpenter._ (Oxford University"
6328,LIBRARY,"Press: $1.75 net.) Competent academic verse on classical models,"

6330,LIBRARY,
6331,LIBRARY,_The Poet and Nature: What He Saw and What He Heard. By Madison Cawein._
6332,LIBRARY,"(John P. Morton & Co.: Louisville, Kentucky. $1.50.) A volume of prose"
6333,LIBRARY,and verse designed to encourage a love of poetry in children. The first
6334,LIBRARY,half of the volume is in the form of a juvenile story with previously
6335,LIBRARY,published lyrics of Mr. Cawein interspersed as examples of poetic
6336,LIBRARY,beauty: the second half of the volume consists of hitherto uncollected
6337,LIBRARY,poems of nature by Mr. Cawein now gathered together under the title of
6338,LIBRARY,_The Morning Road_. This part of the volume should give especial
6339,LIBRARY,pleasure to Mr. Cawein’s readers.
6340,LIBRARY,
6341,LIBRARY,"_Green Days and Blue Days. By Patrick R. Chalmers._ (Norman, Remington:"
6342,LIBRARY,$1.00 net.) A pleasant volume of light verse by a contributor to
6343,LIBRARY,_Punch_. The verses do not pretend to be more than agreeable
6344,LIBRARY,"diversions, and reflect the lighter moods of life happily and in"
6345,LIBRARY,delicate numbers.
6346,LIBRARY,
6347,LIBRARY,"_At the Shrine, and Other Poems. By George Herbert Clarke._ (Stewart and"
6348,LIBRARY,Kidd: $1.25 net.) A pleasant unassuming collection of somewhat academic
6349,LIBRARY,verse reflecting a life of scholarly leisure. The closing section of
6350,LIBRARY,"letters in verse to departed novelists is particularly happy, recalling"
6351,LIBRARY,at no great distance the similar work of Austin Dobson.
6352,LIBRARY,
6353,LIBRARY,* _Path Flower. By Olive Tilford Dargan._ (Scribner: $1.25 net.) With
6354,LIBRARY,this volume of lyrical poems Olive Tilford Dargan definitely takes her
6355,LIBRARY,place as one of our foremost younger poets. With much of Francis
6356,LIBRARY,"Thompson’s vision of an overarching heaven and a shadowed earth, and"
6357,LIBRARY,"also much of Thompson’s mannerism, she is herself in the best of these"
6358,LIBRARY,"poems, in which she treats high themes with high artistic fervor. Her"
6359,LIBRARY,"feeling for landscape is English in its delicacy, and she has"
6360,LIBRARY,interpreted the influence of nature on human life and its incidence with
6361,LIBRARY,clear insight and sympathy. No one will deny Mrs. Dargan’s poetic
6362,LIBRARY,inspiration or the refinement of her vision.
6363,LIBRARY,
6364,LIBRARY,"_Florence on a Certain Night, and Other Poems. By Coningsby Dawson._"
6365,LIBRARY,(Holt: $1.25 net.) A volume of undistinguished literary verse by a
6366,LIBRARY,distinguished novelist.
6367,LIBRARY,
6368,LIBRARY,* _America and Other Poems. By W. J. Dawson._ (Lane: $1.25 net.) The
6369,LIBRARY,expression of an ideal America as seen by one with an alien tradition.
6370,LIBRARY,"The volume includes several fine ballad narratives, notably “The Kiss,”"
6371,LIBRARY,"“Salome,” and the swift sure rhythmic “Last Ride of the Sheik Abdullah;”"
6372,LIBRARY,"above all, “Blake’s Homecoming,” a member of the royal line of English"
6373,LIBRARY,"ballads. In addition to competent lyrics on various themes, special"
6374,LIBRARY,attention should be called to the poems of childhood and the delicately
6375,LIBRARY,imagined meditative poems of religious feeling. So many religious poems
6376,LIBRARY,"rely wholly on a good intention, “more fit to pave Hell than cause"
6377,LIBRARY,"rejoicing in Heaven,” as a French critic says, that exceptions should be"
6378,LIBRARY,noted. The volume marks an appreciable advance over Dr. Dawson’s
6379,LIBRARY,previous collections.
6380,LIBRARY,
6381,LIBRARY,_A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century for the Seven Hundredth Anniversary
6382,LIBRARY,of Roger Bacon. The Text by John Erskine._ (Columbia University Press.)
6383,LIBRARY,A pageant reflecting the culture and endeavor of the thirteenth century
6384,LIBRARY,in every field. The text is in verse of fine texture and imaginative
6385,LIBRARY,expression by Professor Erskine of Columbia University. While the
6386,LIBRARY,"pageant itself has been deferred because of the war, it is still"
6387,LIBRARY,"possible to enjoy the text, and to look forward to the pageant’s"
6388,LIBRARY,representation in the near future.
6389,LIBRARY,
6390,LIBRARY,_Lux Juventutis: A Book of Verse. By Katharine A. Esdaile._
6391,LIBRARY,(Houghton-Mifflin: $1.25 net.) The first volume of a young English poet
6392,LIBRARY,who shows considerable promise. It is characterised by classical
6393,LIBRARY,"restraint and a fine feeling for form, and does not lack singing"
6394,LIBRARY,quality.
6395,LIBRARY,
6396,LIBRARY,* _Sonnets from the Patagonian. By Donald Evans._ (Claire-Marie: $1.25
6397,LIBRARY,"net.) Eighteen impressionistic sonnets of exotic workmanship, suggesting"
6398,LIBRARY,"the fantasy of Laforgue, but more extremely composed in disembodied"
6399,LIBRARY,"words. They rely on tone color for much of their effect, and are bizarre"
6400,LIBRARY,"to the point of irony. However, they grow on the reader as he becomes"
6401,LIBRARY,"familiar with them, and their consummate art is unquestionable."
6402,LIBRARY,
6403,LIBRARY,* _Sonnets of a Portrait-Painter. By Arthur Davison Ficke._ (Kennerley:
6404,LIBRARY,$1.00 net.) A sequence of fifty-seven sonnets in an undeservedly
6405,LIBRARY,"neglected form, which do not recall too definitely Meredith’s _Modern"
6406,LIBRARY,Love_. They are extremely subtle and their intellectual content is very
6407,LIBRARY,"closely woven, so that they will prove difficult reading, but they repay"
6408,LIBRARY,"careful study, and in many sonnets the lyric impulse has happily"
6409,LIBRARY,overmastered the poet completely. A collection which is worthy of
6410,LIBRARY,several readings.
6411,LIBRARY,
6412,LIBRARY,"* _Arrows in the Gale. By Arturo Giovannitti._ (Hillacre Bookhouse,"
6413,LIBRARY,"Riverside, Connecticut: $1.25 net.) One of the more important volumes of"
6414,LIBRARY,new verse this year. A passionate voicing of social injustice in
6415,LIBRARY,"imaginative strophes, which introduce a new poetic form with"
6416,LIBRARY,"considerable art. _The Cage_, when printed in the Atlantic Monthly, last"
6417,LIBRARY,"year, was called the most significant poem published in that periodical"
6418,LIBRARY,since Moody’s _Ode in Time of Hesitation_. The volume claims a hearing
6419,LIBRARY,as fine poetry rather than as an expression of Syndicalism. There is an
6420,LIBRARY,appreciative introduction by Helen Keller which is good criticism.
6421,LIBRARY,
6422,LIBRARY,* _My Lady’s Book. By Gerald Gould._ (Kennerley: $1.00 net.) Twenty
6423,LIBRARY,lyrics of pure song quality which are almost faultless in their
6424,LIBRARY,"perfection, though in a minor key. A volume to afford pure delight by"
6425,LIBRARY,its unaffected lyric quality.
6426,LIBRARY,
6427,LIBRARY,"_Poems. By Katharine Howard._ (Sherman, French: $1.00 net.) Minor verse"
6428,LIBRARY,"in _vers libre_, which is frequently pleasing and always individual. It"
6429,LIBRARY,is the expression of a whimsical personality who wears her singing robes
6430,LIBRARY,"lightly, and who is most successful in verse of macabre suggestion."
6431,LIBRARY,
6432,LIBRARY,* _Des Imagistes: An Anthology._ (Boni: $1.00.) The best collection of
6433,LIBRARY,"“imagiste” poetry, in which the work of Ford Madox Hueffer, F. S. Flint,"
6434,LIBRARY,"Amy Lowell, and others is represented. There are many poems in the"
6435,LIBRARY,"volume which will give pleasure, but as a collection it is uneven and"
6436,LIBRARY,rather tenuous. The work of F. S. Flint which it contains justifies the
6437,LIBRARY,volume’s purchase.
6438,LIBRARY,
6439,LIBRARY,_The Thresher’s Wife. By Harry Kemp._ (Boni: $.40 net.) A narrative poem
6440,LIBRARY,"well told in the manner of Masefield, whose influence upon it has been"
6441,LIBRARY,great.
6442,LIBRARY,
6443,LIBRARY,"* _Trees, and Other Poems. By Joyce Kilmer._ (Doran: $1.00 net.) The"
6444,LIBRARY,spirit of youth and grave faith expressed in lyric numbers. This slight
6445,LIBRARY,little book defines a personality of poetic interest. The book shows
6446,LIBRARY,"less alien influence than most recent American poetry, and is quite"
6447,LIBRARY,"individual in its affirmations. Though unassuming, the book will not"
6448,LIBRARY,meet with just treatment unless we recognize the fine lyric
6449,LIBRARY,accomplishment of such poems as _Trees_ and _Martin_. Is this volume the
6450,LIBRARY,prelude of a little Catholic Renaissance in American poetry?
6451,LIBRARY,
6452,LIBRARY,* _The Shadow of Ætna. By Louie V. Ledoux._ (Putnam: $1.00 net.)
6453,LIBRARY,Severely chaste poetry on classical models of distinguished beauty. They
6454,LIBRARY,reveal fine intellectual feeling that recalls Shelley in its intensity
6455,LIBRARY,and Arnold in its disciplined reticence. They have all the warmth of
6456,LIBRARY,"life seen against an eternal background, and a passionate message which"
6457,LIBRARY,cannot go unheeded.
6458,LIBRARY,
6459,LIBRARY,"* _The Sharing. By Agnes Lee._ (Sherman, French: $1.00 net.) Agnes"
6460,LIBRARY,"Lee’s new book has all her familiar qualities, but in addition it"
6461,LIBRARY,presents a new criticism of life which reveals a feeling for human
6462,LIBRARY,values akin in many respects to that of Browning. In its brevity and
6463,LIBRARY,"search for the polished word, it suggests the sculptor’s art, and many"
6464,LIBRARY,of these poems would have pleased Landor for their freight of suggestion
6465,LIBRARY,and elemental simplicity.
6466,LIBRARY,
6467,LIBRARY,* _Sword Blades and Poppy Seed. By Amy Lowell._ (Macmillan: $1.25 net.)
6468,LIBRARY,"A volume, not only of interesting experiment in _vers libre_ and exotic"
6469,LIBRARY,"rhythms, but of notable accomplishment in poetry. Though associated"
6470,LIBRARY,"with the “imagiste” school of English poetry, Miss Lowell’s talent is"
6471,LIBRARY,"independent of it, and in her narrative and lyric poems alike one feels"
6472,LIBRARY,an artistic firmness and restraint which results in clear vision clearly
6473,LIBRARY,"sung. Best of all, this “imagiste” poetry is healthy and able to fight"
6474,LIBRARY,for its existence. In so far as it is derivative from French influences
6475,LIBRARY,"it adds a new note to English verse, and reveals a subtle use of free"
6476,LIBRARY,cadenced rhythms which is fully responsive to the mood and feeling of
6477,LIBRARY,the poem. Far more genuine and spontaneous than Miss Lowell’s first
6478,LIBRARY,volume.
6479,LIBRARY,
6480,LIBRARY,_The Passing Singer and Other Poems. By Samuel Henry Marcus._ (Stratford
6481,LIBRARY,Pub. Co.: $1.00 net.) A modest first volume which is likely to receive
6482,LIBRARY,less attention than it deserves. Mr. Marcus has not yet found himself in
6483,LIBRARY,"poetry, but he sings the present condition of humanity sincerely and"
6484,LIBRARY,"passionately. When he sings it simply, he will be more satisfying, but"
6485,LIBRARY,this volume will give pleasure to any one who really cares for poetry.
6486,LIBRARY,
6487,LIBRARY,* _Poems. By Edward Sandford Martin._ (Scribner: $1.50 net.) The
6488,LIBRARY,collected verse of the Editor of _Life_. Mellow Horatian philosophy and
6489,LIBRARY,wit not yet frost-bitten by a man whom Dr. Johnson would have pronounced
6490,LIBRARY,clubbable and with whom Boswells must feel uncomfortable.
6491,LIBRARY,
6492,LIBRARY,_You and I. By Harriet Monroe._ (Macmillan: $1.25 net.) A bulky volume
6493,LIBRARY,of verse by the editor of _Poetry: A Magazine Of Verse_. In it the
6494,LIBRARY,"social note is voiced strongly, and expression is given to many phases"
6495,LIBRARY,"of modern effort, but its intellectual content rather overshadows its"
6496,LIBRARY,lyric quality.
6497,LIBRARY,
6498,LIBRARY,* _The Sea is Kind. By T. Sturge Moore._ (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.50 net.)
6499,LIBRARY,This is the first collection issued in America of the poems of an
6500,LIBRARY,"English craftsman of great distinction and power, whose chief weakness"
6501,LIBRARY,is an over-proportion of intellectual substance. He lacks the glow of
6502,LIBRARY,"beauty, and perhaps of beauty’s realization, but his work is literary"
6503,LIBRARY,"craftsmanship of the highest order, and his metrical experiments are"
6504,LIBRARY,almost as significant as those of Mr. Bridges. Altogether the artistic
6505,LIBRARY,product of a richly stored mind without aspiration or imaginative
6506,LIBRARY,vision.
6507,LIBRARY,
6508,LIBRARY,* _Saloon Sonnets: With Sunday Flutings. By Allen Norton._
6509,LIBRARY,(Claire-Marie: $1.25 net.) A volume less bizarre than its title implies.
6510,LIBRARY,"The sonnets bear evidence of _ueberkultur_, but occasionally surprise"
6511,LIBRARY,the reader by their pleasant lyric charm. They do not lack virility and
6512,LIBRARY,enthusiasm.
6513,LIBRARY,
6514,LIBRARY,_The Sister of the Wind. By Grace Fallow Norton._ (Houghton-Mifflin:
6515,LIBRARY,$1.00 net.) A new volume by the author of _Little Gray Songs from St.
6516,LIBRARY,Joseph’s_ which is most disappointing. In a poet of Miss Norton’s
6517,LIBRARY,"quality, it is inevitable that there should be always something to repay"
6518,LIBRARY,"the reader, but this volume is singularly unrepresentative of Miss"
6519,LIBRARY,Norton’s real powers.
6520,LIBRARY,
6521,LIBRARY,_Celtic Memories. By Norreys Jephson O’Conor._ (Lane: $1.00 net.) A
6522,LIBRARY,"first volume of some promise by a recent graduate of Harvard, whose"
6523,LIBRARY,"Irish feeling is drawn directly from experience, but whose expression is"
6524,LIBRARY,still drawn chiefly from books.
6525,LIBRARY,
6526,LIBRARY,* _The Ebon Muse and Other Poems by Léon Laviaux. Englished by John
6527,LIBRARY,Myers O’Hara._ (Smith and Sale: $2.00 net.) Translations from the work
6528,LIBRARY,"of a young Creole poet, glorifying the “fille de couleur” in love poetry"
6529,LIBRARY,"of original beauty. Differing from Latin and Oriental passion alike, it"
6530,LIBRARY,reveals a type of feminine beauty which is wholly new to Northern
6531,LIBRARY,readers.
6532,LIBRARY,
6533,LIBRARY,* _An Epilogue To the Praise of Angus and Other Poems. By Seumas
6534,LIBRARY,"O’Sullivan._ (Norman, Remington Co.: $.75 net.) A thin sheaf of delicate"
6535,LIBRARY,poems by one of the foremost poets of the New Ireland. Akin in certain
6536,LIBRARY,"aspects of his vision to “Æ,” who does not surpass him, his verses have"
6537,LIBRARY,"more singing quality, and he is a successful experimenter in various new"
6538,LIBRARY,verse forms which reproduce cadences in ancient Irish music.
6539,LIBRARY,
6540,LIBRARY,"* _One Woman to Another, and Other Poems. By Corinne Roosevelt"
6541,LIBRARY,Robinson._ (Scribner: $1.25 net.) Dramatic monologues and sonnets of
6542,LIBRARY,"sharply etched lines whose competence is unquestionable, and a more"
6543,LIBRARY,satisfying reality of human feeling than in Mrs. Robinson’s previous
6544,LIBRARY,volume. The volume will give much intellectual and some emotional
6545,LIBRARY,"pleasure, and in two or three lyrics the poet has achieved high ground."
6546,LIBRARY,
6547,LIBRARY,"* _Beyond the Breakers, and other Poems. By George Sterling._"
6548,LIBRARY,(Robertson: $1.25 net.) This is Mr. Sterling’s first thoroughly
6549,LIBRARY,satisfying book. It includes the superb “Ode on the Centenary of the
6550,LIBRARY,"Birth of Robert Browning,” and poems of such importance as “Tidal, King"
6551,LIBRARY,"of Nations,” “Willy Pitcher,” “The Mission Swallows,” “Past the Panes,”"
6552,LIBRARY,and “You Never Can Tell.” We must call particular attention to the
6553,LIBRARY,vision of the noble ode entitled “Beyond the Sunset.” With less opulent
6554,LIBRARY,"diction and heady imagination than Mr. Sterling’s earlier volumes,"
6555,LIBRARY,_Beyond the Breakers_ shows a disciplined vision expressed with a
6556,LIBRARY,disciplined technique.
6557,LIBRARY,
6558,LIBRARY,_Open Water. By Arthur Stringer._ (Lane: $1.00 net) A collection of
6559,LIBRARY,delicate pictures expressing many frail and drifting moods phrased in
6560,LIBRARY,_vers libre_ not yet quite sure of itself. The volume contains much
6561,LIBRARY,"quiet beauty, and is prefaced by a plea for _vers libre_ of considerable"
6562,LIBRARY,documentary and critical value. A volume which the lover of poetry can
6563,LIBRARY,scarcely neglect.
6564,LIBRARY,
6565,LIBRARY,_Idylls of Greece. Third Series. By Howard V. Sutherland._ (Fitzgerald:
6566,LIBRARY,$1.00 net) Modest idylls of Greek fable telling with some passages of
6567,LIBRARY,"beauty the tales of “Idas and Marpessa,” “Rhodanthe,” “Sappho and"
6568,LIBRARY,"Phaon,” and “Œnone.” The blank verse, though not firm, is of"
6569,LIBRARY,"well-wrought texture, and Mr. Sutherland expresses feelingly the"
6570,LIBRARY,fleeting beauty of Pagan love and Hellenic landscape. Mr. Sutherland’s
6571,LIBRARY,three volumes merit more attention than they have received.
6572,LIBRARY,
6573,LIBRARY,_The Poems of François Villon. Translated by H. De Vere Stacpoole._
6574,LIBRARY,"(Lane: $1.50 net) A convenient edition of Villon’s best work, in which a"
6575,LIBRARY,reasonably accurate text of the two Testaments and the best of the
6576,LIBRARY,"Ballades and Rondels is printed, together with a running commentary, a"
6577,LIBRARY,"vivid introduction, and translations of some of the shorter poems with"
6578,LIBRARY,"dubious success. However, the volume is the best popular service to"
6579,LIBRARY,"Villon that has yet been performed in this country, and should be on the"
6580,LIBRARY,library shelf.
6581,LIBRARY,
6582,LIBRARY,* _Little Verse for a Little Clan. By F.D.W._ (Published Privately: Not
6583,LIBRARY,for Sale.) A slight little volume of thirty-five pages of delicate
6584,LIBRARY,"workmanship, which contain poems that make the book rank among the very"
6585,LIBRARY,best of the year. I know of very few books written by Americans which
6586,LIBRARY,would afford the pleasure to discriminating readers that this volume
6587,LIBRARY,would offer were it to be published in a form accessible to all. It is
6588,LIBRARY,"as delicate, at its best, as Beeching and Mackail’s _Love in Idleness_,"
6589,LIBRARY,and will please all lovers of _A Shropshire Lad_. It is just the sort of
6590,LIBRARY,book which Mr. Mosher used to delight in finding for the American
6591,LIBRARY,public. I shall be glad to give further information about it to
6592,LIBRARY,inquirers.
6593,LIBRARY,
6594,LIBRARY,"_Eris: A Dramatic Allegory. By Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff._ (Moffat,"
6595,LIBRARY,"Yard, and Co.: $1.00 net.) A short dramatic allegory in which the"
6596,LIBRARY,"elements of poetry are present, but which is hardly successful in fusing"
6597,LIBRARY,them into life. There are several pages of genuine poetry which prove
6598,LIBRARY,"the certainty of the poet’s ultimate accomplishment, and much competent"
6599,LIBRARY,"craftsmanship. This is an honest book, whose weakness is that the"
6600,LIBRARY,imagination of the reader has no suggestive substance to feed upon.
6601,LIBRARY,
6602,LIBRARY,_Justification: A Philosophic Phantasy. By John H. White._ (Richard G.
6603,LIBRARY,Badger: $1.00.) A poem in four short cantos and though philosophic in
6604,LIBRARY,conception is full of abstract idealisms. The author has a fruitful
6605,LIBRARY,"imagination, but his reasoning on the origin and destiny of human life"
6606,LIBRARY,"is profound. The verse, though concrete, is flexible."
6607,LIBRARY,
6608,LIBRARY,* _The Collected Poems of Margaret L. Woods._ (Lane: $1.50 net.) The
6609,LIBRARY,definitive edition of the poetry and drama of a great weaver of words
6610,LIBRARY,"and emotion, who unites to much of Lionel Johnson’s repressed sombreness"
6611,LIBRARY,a sustained beauty of musical effect which was characteristic of the
6612,LIBRARY,earlier poet. Mrs. Woods has performed for Oxford the poetic service
6613,LIBRARY,"that Johnson performed for Winchester, and in other poems has added new"
6614,LIBRARY,immortalities to Westminster Abbey’s crown. The plays are finely wrought
6615,LIBRARY,"and deeply felt, and together with the lyrics, place Mrs. Woods in the"
6616,LIBRARY,authentic English poetic line.
