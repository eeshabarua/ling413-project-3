26,AMERICA,
27,AMERICA,Harun Omar and Master Hafiz
28,AMERICA,keep your dead beautiful ladies.
29,AMERICA,Mine is a little lovelier
30,AMERICA,than any of your ladies were.
31,AMERICA,
32,AMERICA,In her perfectest array
33,AMERICA,"my lady, moving in the day,"
34,AMERICA,is a little stranger thing
35,AMERICA,than crisp Sheba with her king
36,AMERICA,in the morning wandering.
37,AMERICA,
38,AMERICA,[Illustration]
39,AMERICA,
40,AMERICA,Through the young and awkward hours
41,AMERICA,"my lady perfectly moving,"
42,AMERICA,through the new world scarce astir
43,AMERICA,my fragile lady wandering
44,AMERICA,in whose perishable poise
45,AMERICA,is the mystery of Spring
46,AMERICA,(with her beauty more than snow
47,AMERICA,dexterous and fugitive
48,AMERICA,my very frail lady drifting
49,AMERICA,"distinctly, moving like a myth"
50,AMERICA,"in the uncertain morning, with"
51,AMERICA,April feet like sudden flowers
52,AMERICA,
53,AMERICA,[Illustration]
54,AMERICA,
55,AMERICA,[Illustration]
56,AMERICA,
57,AMERICA,and all her body filled with May)
58,AMERICA,—moving in the unskilful day
59,AMERICA,"my lady utterly alive,"
60,AMERICA,to me is a more curious thing
61,AMERICA,(a thing more nimble and complete)
62,AMERICA,than ever to Judea’s king
63,AMERICA,were the shapely sharp cunning
64,AMERICA,and withal delirious feet
65,AMERICA,of the Princess Salome
66,AMERICA,carefully dancing in the noise
67,AMERICA,"of Herod’s silence, long ago."
68,AMERICA,
69,AMERICA,If she a little turn her head
70,AMERICA,i know that i am wholly dead:
71,AMERICA,nor ever did on such a throat
72,AMERICA,"the lips of Tristram slowly dote,"
73,AMERICA,La beale Isoud whose leman was.
74,AMERICA,And if my lady look at me
75,AMERICA,(with her eyes which like two elves
76,AMERICA,incredibly amuse themselves)
77,AMERICA,"with a look of færie,"
78,AMERICA,perhaps a little suddenly
79,AMERICA,(as sometimes the improbable
80,AMERICA,beauty of my lady will)
81,AMERICA,—at her glance my spirit shies
82,AMERICA,rearing (as in the miracle
83,AMERICA,of a lady who had eyes
84,AMERICA,which the king’s horses might not kill.)
85,AMERICA,
86,AMERICA,[Illustration]
87,AMERICA,
88,AMERICA,"But should my lady smile, it were"
89,AMERICA,a flower of so pure surprise
90,AMERICA,"(it were so very new a flower,"
91,AMERICA,"a flower so frail, a flower so glad)"
92,AMERICA,as trembling used to yield with dew
93,AMERICA,when the world was young and new
94,AMERICA,(a flower such as the world had
95,AMERICA,in Springtime when the world was mad
96,AMERICA,"and Launcelot spoke to Guenever,"
97,AMERICA,a flower which most heavy hung
98,AMERICA,with silence when the world was young
99,AMERICA,and Diarmid looked in Grania’s eyes.)
100,AMERICA,But should my lady’s beauty play
101,AMERICA,at not speaking (somtimes as
102,AMERICA,it will) the silence of her face
103,AMERICA,doth immediately make
104,AMERICA,"in my heart so great a noise,"
105,AMERICA,as in the sharp and thirsty blood
106,AMERICA,of Paris would not all the Troys
107,AMERICA,of Helen’s beauty: never did
108,AMERICA,Lord Jason (in impossible things
109,AMERICA,victorious impossibly)
110,AMERICA,"so wholly burn, to undertake"
111,AMERICA,Medea’s rescuing eyes; nor he
112,AMERICA,when swooned the white egyptian day
113,AMERICA,who with Egypt’s body lay.
114,AMERICA,
115,AMERICA,[Illustration]
116,AMERICA,
117,AMERICA,Lovely as those ladies were
118,AMERICA,mine is a little lovelier.
119,AMERICA,
120,AMERICA,"And if she speak in her frail way,"
121,AMERICA,it is wholly to bewitch
122,AMERICA,my smallest thought with a most swift
123,AMERICA,radiance wherein slowly drift
124,AMERICA,murmurous things divinely bright;
125,AMERICA,it is foolingly to smite
126,AMERICA,my spirit with the lithe free twitch
127,AMERICA,"of scintillant space, with the cool writhe"
128,AMERICA,of gloom truly which syncopate
129,AMERICA,some sunbeam’s skilful fingerings;
130,AMERICA,it is utterly to lull
131,AMERICA,with foliate inscrutable
132,AMERICA,sweetness my soul obedient;
133,AMERICA,it is to stroke my being with
134,AMERICA,"numbing forests frolicsome,"
135,AMERICA,"fleetly mystical, aroam"
136,AMERICA,with keen creatures of idiom
137,AMERICA,(beings alert and innocent
138,AMERICA,very deftly upon which
139,AMERICA,indolent miracles impinge)
140,AMERICA,—it is distinctly to confute
141,AMERICA,my reason with the deep caress
142,AMERICA,"of every most shy thing and mute,"
143,AMERICA,it is to quell me with the twinge
144,AMERICA,of all living intense things.
145,AMERICA,
146,AMERICA,Never my soul so fortunate
147,AMERICA,is (past the luck of all dead men
148,AMERICA,and loving) as invisibly when
149,AMERICA,upon her palpable solitude
150,AMERICA,"a furtive occult fragrance steals,"
151,AMERICA,a gesture of immaculate
152,AMERICA,perfume—whereby (with fear aglow)
153,AMERICA,my soul is wont wholly to know
154,AMERICA,the poignant instantaneous fern
155,AMERICA,whose scrupulous enchanted fronds
156,AMERICA,"toward all things intrinsic yearn,"
157,AMERICA,the immanent subliminal
158,AMERICA,fern of her delicious voice
159,AMERICA,(of her voice which always dwells
160,AMERICA,beside the vivid magical
161,AMERICA,impetuous and utter ponds
162,AMERICA,of dream; and very secret food
163,AMERICA,its leaves inimitable find
164,AMERICA,"beyond the white authentic springs,"
165,AMERICA,"beyond the sweet instinctive wells,"
166,AMERICA,which make to flourish the minute
167,AMERICA,spontaneous meadow of her mind)
168,AMERICA,"—the vocal fern, always which feels"
169,AMERICA,the keen ecstatic actual tread
170,AMERICA,(and thereto perfectly responds)
171,AMERICA,"of all things exquisite and dead,"
172,AMERICA,all living things and beautiful.

178,AMERICA,(Caliph and king their ladies had
179,AMERICA,"to love them and to make them glad,"
180,AMERICA,"when the world was young and mad,"
181,AMERICA,in the city of Bagdad—
182,AMERICA,mine is a little lovelier
183,AMERICA,than any of those ladies were.)
184,AMERICA,
185,AMERICA,"Her body is most beauteous,"
186,AMERICA,being for all things amorous
187,AMERICA,fashioned very curiously
188,AMERICA,of roses and of ivory.
189,AMERICA,The immaculate crisp head
190,AMERICA,is such as only certain dead
191,AMERICA,and careful painters love to use
192,AMERICA,for their youngest angels (whose
193,AMERICA,praising bodies in a row
194,AMERICA,between slow glories fleetly go.)
195,AMERICA,Upon a keen and lovely throat
196,AMERICA,"the strangeness of her face doth float,"
197,AMERICA,which in eyes and lips consists
198,AMERICA,—always upon the mouth there trysts
199,AMERICA,curvingly a fragile smile
200,AMERICA,which like a flower lieth (while
201,AMERICA,within the eyes is dimly heard
202,AMERICA,a wistful and precarious bird.)
203,AMERICA,
204,AMERICA,[Illustration]
205,AMERICA,
206,AMERICA,"Springing from fragrant shoulders small,"
207,AMERICA,"ardent, and perfectly withal"
208,AMERICA,smooth to stroke and sweet to see
209,AMERICA,"as a supple and young tree,"
210,AMERICA,her slim lascivious arms alight
211,AMERICA,in skilful wrists which hint at flight
212,AMERICA,—my lady’s very singular
213,AMERICA,and slenderest hands moreover are
214,AMERICA,(which as lilies smile and quail)
215,AMERICA,of all things perfect the most frail.

221,AMERICA,(Whoso rideth in the tale
222,AMERICA,of Chaucer knoweth many a pair
223,AMERICA,of companions blithe and fair;
224,AMERICA,who to walk with Master Gower
225,AMERICA,in Confessio doth prefer
226,AMERICA,"shall not lack for beauty there,"
227,AMERICA,nor he that will amaying go
228,AMERICA,with my lord Boccaccio—
229,AMERICA,whoso knocketh at the door
230,AMERICA,of Marie and of Maleore
231,AMERICA,findeth of ladies goodly store
232,AMERICA,whose beauty did in nothing err.
233,AMERICA,If to me there shall appear
234,AMERICA,"than a rose more sweetly known,"
235,AMERICA,"more silently than a flower,"
236,AMERICA,my lady naked in her hair—
237,AMERICA,i for those ladies nothing care
238,AMERICA,nor any lady dead and gone.)
239,AMERICA,
240,AMERICA,Each tapering breast is firm and smooth
241,AMERICA,that in a lovely fashion doth
242,AMERICA,from my lady’s body grow;
243,AMERICA,"as morning may a lily know,"
244,AMERICA,her petaled flesh doth entertain
245,AMERICA,the adroit blood’s mysterious skein
246,AMERICA,(but like some passionate earlier
247,AMERICA,"flower, the snow will oft utter,"
248,AMERICA,whereof the year has perfect bliss—
249,AMERICA,"for each breast a blossom is,"
250,AMERICA,which being a little while caressed
251,AMERICA,its fragrance makes the lover blest.)
252,AMERICA,Her waist is a most tiny hinge
253,AMERICA,"of flesh, a winsome thing and strange;"
254,AMERICA,apt in my hand warmly to lie
255,AMERICA,it is a throbbing neck whereby
256,AMERICA,to grasp the belly’s ample vase
257,AMERICA,(that urgent urn which doth amass
258,AMERICA,"for whoso drinks, a dizzier wine"
259,AMERICA,than should the grapes of heaven combine
260,AMERICA,with earth’s madness)—’tis a gate
261,AMERICA,unto a palace intricate
262,AMERICA,(whereof the luscious pillars rise
263,AMERICA,which are her large and shapely thighs)
264,AMERICA,in whose dome the trembling bliss
265,AMERICA,of a kingdom wholly is.
266,AMERICA,
267,AMERICA,Beneath her thighs such legs are seen
268,AMERICA,as were the pride of the world’s queen:
269,AMERICA,"each is a verb, miraculous"
270,AMERICA,"inflected oral devious,"
271,AMERICA,beneath the body’s breathing noun
272,AMERICA,(moreover the delicious frown
273,AMERICA,of the grave great sensual knees
274,AMERICA,well might any monarch please.)
275,AMERICA,Each ankle is divinely shy;
276,AMERICA,as if for fear you would espy
277,AMERICA,the little distinct foot (if whose
278,AMERICA,very minuteness doth abuse
279,AMERICA,"reason, why then the artificer"
280,AMERICA,did most exquisitely err.)

283,AMERICA,
284,AMERICA,When the world was like a song
285,AMERICA,"heard behind a golden door,"
286,AMERICA,poet and sage and caliph had
287,AMERICA,to love them and to make them glad
288,AMERICA,ladies with lithe eyes and long
289,AMERICA,(when the world was like a flower
290,AMERICA,Omar Hafiz and Harun
291,AMERICA,loved their ladies in the moon)
292,AMERICA,—fashioned very curiously
293,AMERICA,of roses and of ivory
294,AMERICA,if naked she appear to me
295,AMERICA,my flesh is an enchanted tree;
296,AMERICA,with her lips’ most frail parting
297,AMERICA,"my body hears the cry of Spring,"
298,AMERICA,and with their frailest syllable
299,AMERICA,its leaves go crisp with miracle.

305,AMERICA,"Love!—maker of my lady,"
306,AMERICA,in that alway beyond this
307,AMERICA,poem or any poem she
308,AMERICA,of whose body words are afraid
309,AMERICA,"perfectly beautiful is,"
310,AMERICA,forgive these words which i have made.
311,AMERICA,"And never boast your dead beauties,"
312,AMERICA,you greatest lovers in the world!
313,AMERICA,"who with Grania strangely fled,"
314,AMERICA,"who with Egypt went to bed,"
315,AMERICA,whom white-thighed Semiramis
316,AMERICA,put up her mouth to wholly kiss—
317,AMERICA,"never boast your dead beauties,"
318,AMERICA,mine being unto me sweeter
319,AMERICA,(of whose shy delicious glance
320,AMERICA,"things which never more shall be,"
321,AMERICA,"perfect things of færie,"
322,AMERICA,are intense inhabitants;
323,AMERICA,in whose warm superlative
324,AMERICA,body do distinctly live
325,AMERICA,all sweet cities passed away—
326,AMERICA,in her flesh at break of day
327,AMERICA,"are the smells of Nineveh,"
328,AMERICA,in her eyes when day is gone
329,AMERICA,are the cries of Babylon.)
330,AMERICA,"Diarmid Paris and Solomon,"
331,AMERICA,"Omar Harun and Master Hafiz,"
332,AMERICA,to me your ladies are all one—
333,AMERICA,keep your dead beautiful ladies.

337,AMERICA,Eater of all things lovely—Time!
338,AMERICA,upon whose watering lips the world
339,AMERICA,"poises a moment (futile, proud,"
340,AMERICA,a costly morsel of sweet tears)
341,AMERICA,"gesticulates, and disappears—"
342,AMERICA,of all dainties which do crowd
343,AMERICA,gaily upon oblivion
344,AMERICA,sweeter than any there is one;
345,AMERICA,to touch it is the fear of rhyme—
346,AMERICA,in life’s very fragile hour
347,AMERICA,(when the world was like a tale
348,AMERICA,"made of laughter and of dew,"
349,AMERICA,"was a flight, a flower, a flame,"
350,AMERICA,was a tendril fleetly curled
351,AMERICA,upon frailness) used to stroll
352,AMERICA,(very slowly) one or two
353,AMERICA,"ladies like flowers made,"
354,AMERICA,softly used to wholly move
355,AMERICA,slender ladies made of dream
356,AMERICA,(in the lazy world and new
357,AMERICA,sweetly used to laugh and love
358,AMERICA,"ladies with crisp eyes and frail,"
359,AMERICA,in the city of Bagdad.)

367,AMERICA,This edition of E.E. Cummings’ Puella Mea with reproductions of
368,AMERICA,drawings and paintings by Klee is made possible through the kind
369,AMERICA,permission of Curt Valentin of Buchholz Gallery. The Modigliani drawing
370,AMERICA,"is used by the courtesy of his publishers, in Milan, Italy. For the"
371,AMERICA,"drawing by Picasso thanks are due to Mary Callery, who consented to its"
372,AMERICA,use. Kurt Roesch contributed his drawing which is the only illustration
373,AMERICA,expressly made for this book when it was decided to have work by other
374,AMERICA,"modern masters in addition to the one drawing by the author himself,"
375,AMERICA,which appears on the first text page of his poem.
