70,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
71,INTRODUCTION,
72,INTRODUCTION,
73,INTRODUCTION,During the last three or four years there has been a remarkable
74,INTRODUCTION,"renascence of poetry in both America and England, and an equally"
75,INTRODUCTION,extraordinary revival of public interest in the art.
76,INTRODUCTION,
77,INTRODUCTION,The editors of this anthology wish to present in convenient form
78,INTRODUCTION,representative work of the poets who are to-day creating what is
79,INTRODUCTION,"commonly called “the new poetry,”—a phrase no doubt rash and most"
80,INTRODUCTION,"imperfectly descriptive, since the new in art is always the elder old,"
81,INTRODUCTION,but one difficult to replace with any form of words more exact. Much
82,INTRODUCTION,"newspaper controversy, and a number of special magazines, testify to the"
83,INTRODUCTION,demand for such a book; also many letters to the editors of _Poetry_
84,INTRODUCTION,asking for information—letters not only from individual lovers of the
85,INTRODUCTION,"art, but also from college professors and literary clubs or groups, who"
86,INTRODUCTION,have begun to feel that the poetry of to-day is a vital force no longer
87,INTRODUCTION,"to be ignored. Indeed, many critics feel that poetry is coming nearer"
88,INTRODUCTION,than either the novel or the drama to the actual life of to-day. The
89,INTRODUCTION,"magazine _Poetry_, ever since its foundation in October, 1912, has"
90,INTRODUCTION,"encouraged this new spirit in the art, and the anthology is a further"
91,INTRODUCTION,effort on the part of its editors to present the new spirit to the
92,INTRODUCTION,public.
93,INTRODUCTION,
94,INTRODUCTION,What is the new poetry? and wherein does it differ from the old? The
95,INTRODUCTION,"difference is not in mere details of form, for much poetry infused with"
96,INTRODUCTION,the new spirit conforms to the old measures and rhyme-schemes. It is not
97,INTRODUCTION,"merely in diction, though the truly modern poet rejects the so-called"
98,INTRODUCTION,"“poetic” shifts of language—the _deems_, _’neaths_, _forsooths_, etc.,"
99,INTRODUCTION,"the inversions and high-sounding rotundities, familiar to his"
100,INTRODUCTION,predecessors: all the rhetorical excesses through which most Victorian
101,INTRODUCTION,"poetry now seems “over-apparelled,” as a speaker at a _Poetry_ dinner—a"
102,INTRODUCTION,"lawyer, not a poet—put it in pointing out what the new movement is"
103,INTRODUCTION,"aiming at. These things are important, but the difference goes deeper"
104,INTRODUCTION,"than details of form, strikes through them to fundamental integrities."
105,INTRODUCTION,
106,INTRODUCTION,The new poetry strives for a concrete and immediate realization of life;
107,INTRODUCTION,"it would discard the theory, the abstraction, the remoteness, found in"
108,INTRODUCTION,"all classics not of the first order. It is less vague, less verbose,"
109,INTRODUCTION,"less eloquent, than most poetry of the Victorian period and much work of"
110,INTRODUCTION,earlier periods. It has set before itself an ideal of absolute
111,INTRODUCTION,"simplicity and sincerity—an ideal which implies an individual,"
112,INTRODUCTION,"unstereotyped diction; and an individual, unstereotyped rhythm. Thus"
113,INTRODUCTION,"inspired, it becomes intensive rather than diffuse. It looks out more"
114,INTRODUCTION,eagerly than in; it becomes objective. The term “exteriority” has been
115,INTRODUCTION,"applied to it, but this is incomplete. In presenting the concrete object"
116,INTRODUCTION,"or the concrete environment, whether these be beautiful or ugly, it"
117,INTRODUCTION,"seeks to give more precisely the emotion arising from them, and thus"
118,INTRODUCTION,widens immeasurably the scope of the art.
119,INTRODUCTION,
120,INTRODUCTION,All this implies no disrespect for tradition. The poets of to-day do not
121,INTRODUCTION,discard tradition because they follow the speech of to-day rather than
122,INTRODUCTION,"that of Shakespeare’s time, or strive for organic rhythm rather than use"
123,INTRODUCTION,"a mold which has been perfected by others. On the contrary, they follow"
124,INTRODUCTION,the great tradition when they seek a vehicle suited to their own epoch
125,INTRODUCTION,"and their own creative mood, and resolutely reject all others."
126,INTRODUCTION,
127,INTRODUCTION,Great poetry has always been written in the language of contemporary
128,INTRODUCTION,"speech, and its theme, even when legendary, has always borne a direct"
129,INTRODUCTION,"relation with contemporary thought, contemporary imaginative and"
130,INTRODUCTION,spiritual life. It is this direct relation which the more progressive
131,INTRODUCTION,modern poets are trying to restore. In this effort they discard not only
132,INTRODUCTION,archaic diction but also the shop-worn subjects of past history or
133,INTRODUCTION,"legend, which have been through the centuries a treasure-trove for the"
134,INTRODUCTION,second-rate.
135,INTRODUCTION,
136,INTRODUCTION,"This effort at modern speech, simplicity of form, and authentic vitality"
137,INTRODUCTION,"of theme, is leading our poets to question the authority of the accepted"
138,INTRODUCTION,"laws of English verse, and to study other languages, ancient and modern,"
139,INTRODUCTION,in the effort to find out what poetry really is. It is a strange fact
140,INTRODUCTION,"that, in the common prejudice of cultivated people during the four"
141,INTRODUCTION,"centuries from just before 1400 to just before 1800, nothing was"
142,INTRODUCTION,accepted as poetry in English that did not walk in the iambic measure.
143,INTRODUCTION,"Bits of Elizabethan song and of Dryden’s two musical odes, both beating"
144,INTRODUCTION,"four-time instead of the iambic three, were outlandish intrusions too"
145,INTRODUCTION,"slight to count. To write English poetry, a man must measure his paces"
146,INTRODUCTION,according to the iambic foot-rule; and he must mark off his lines with
147,INTRODUCTION,"rhymes, or at least marshal them in the pentameter movement of blank"
148,INTRODUCTION,verse.
149,INTRODUCTION,
150,INTRODUCTION,"The first protest against this prejudice, which long usage had hardened"
151,INTRODUCTION,"into law, came in the persons of four or five great poets—Burns,"
152,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Byron—who puzzled the ears of their"
153,INTRODUCTION,"generation with anapæsts and other four-time measures, and who carried"
154,INTRODUCTION,into their work a certain immediacy of feeling and imagery—a certain
155,INTRODUCTION,"modern passion of life—which even Cowper, Thompson and a few others of"
156,INTRODUCTION,"their time, though they had written of things around them, had scarcely"
157,INTRODUCTION,"attained. Quarterly critics and London moralists blinked and gasped, but"
158,INTRODUCTION,at last the bars had to go down for these great radicals. And before
159,INTRODUCTION,long the extreme virtuosity of Swinburne had widened still further the
160,INTRODUCTION,musical range of the English language.
161,INTRODUCTION,
162,INTRODUCTION,"By the time Whitman appeared, the ear of the average reader—that"
163,INTRODUCTION,"formidable person—was attuned to anapæsts, dactyls, choriambics,"
164,INTRODUCTION,"sapphics, rhymed or unrhymed. He could not call them by name, but he was"
165,INTRODUCTION,docile to all possible intricacies of pattern in any closely woven
166,INTRODUCTION,metrical scheme. But Whitman gave him a new shock. Here was a so-called
167,INTRODUCTION,"poet who discarded all traditional patterns, and wove a carpet of his"
168,INTRODUCTION,"own. Once more the conservatives protested: was this poetry? and, if so,"
169,INTRODUCTION,"why? If poetry was not founded on the long-accepted metrical laws, then"
170,INTRODUCTION,"how could they distinguish it from prose, and thus keep the labels and"
171,INTRODUCTION,catalogues in order? What was Whitman’s alleged poetry but a kind of
172,INTRODUCTION,"freakish prose, invented to set forth a dangerous anarchistic"
173,INTRODUCTION,philosophy?
174,INTRODUCTION,
175,INTRODUCTION,It would take too long to analyze the large rhythms of Whitman’s free
176,INTRODUCTION,"verse; but the mere fact that he wrote free verse and called it poetry,"
177,INTRODUCTION,"and that other poets—men like Rossetti, Swinburne, Symonds, even the"
178,INTRODUCTION,"reluctant Emerson—seemed to agree that it was poetry, this fact alone"
179,INTRODUCTION,"was, in the opinion of the conservatives, a challenge to four centuries"
180,INTRODUCTION,"of English poets. And this challenge, repeated by later poets, compels"
181,INTRODUCTION,"us to inquire briefly into the origins of English poetry, in the effort"
182,INTRODUCTION,to get behind and underneath the instinctive prejudice that English
183,INTRODUCTION,"poetry, to be poetry, must conform to prescribed metres."
184,INTRODUCTION,
185,INTRODUCTION,"Chaucer, great genius that he was, an aristocrat by birth and breeding,"
186,INTRODUCTION,and a democrat by feeling and sympathy—Chaucer may have had it in his
187,INTRODUCTION,power to turn the whole stream of English poetry into either the French
188,INTRODUCTION,or the Anglo-Saxon channel. Knowing and loving the old French epics
189,INTRODUCTION,"better than the Norse sagas, he naturally chose the French channel, and"
190,INTRODUCTION,he was so great and so beloved that his world followed him. Thus there
191,INTRODUCTION,"was no longer any question—the iambic measure and rhyme, both dear to"
192,INTRODUCTION,"the French-trained ears of England’s Norman masters, became fixed as the"
193,INTRODUCTION,standard type of poetic form.
194,INTRODUCTION,
195,INTRODUCTION,But it was possibly a toss-up—the scale hung almost even in that
196,INTRODUCTION,formative fourteenth century. If Chaucer’s contemporary Langland—the
197,INTRODUCTION,"great democrat, revolutionist, mystic—had had Chaucer’s authority and"
198,INTRODUCTION,"universal sympathy, English poetry might have followed his example"
199,INTRODUCTION,"instead of Chaucer’s; and Shakespeare, Milton and the rest might have"
200,INTRODUCTION,"been impelled by common practice to use—or modify—the curious, heavy,"
201,INTRODUCTION,"alliterative measure of _Piers Ploughman_, which now sounds so strange"
202,INTRODUCTION,to our ears:
203,INTRODUCTION,
204,INTRODUCTION,"In a somer seson,"
205,INTRODUCTION,"When softe was the sonne,"
206,INTRODUCTION,I shoop me into shroudes
207,INTRODUCTION,As I a sheep weere;
208,INTRODUCTION,In habite as an heremite
209,INTRODUCTION,"Unholy of werkes,"
210,INTRODUCTION,Wente wide in this world
211,INTRODUCTION,Wondres to here.
212,INTRODUCTION,
213,INTRODUCTION,"Though we must rejoice that Chaucer prevailed with his French forms,"
214,INTRODUCTION,"Langland reminds us that poetry—even English poetry—is older than rhyme,"
215,INTRODUCTION,"older than the iambic measure, older than all the metrical patterns"
216,INTRODUCTION,which now seem so much a part of it. If our criticism is to have any
217,INTRODUCTION,"value, it must insist upon the obvious truth that poetry existed before"
218,INTRODUCTION,the English language began to form itself out of the débris of other
219,INTRODUCTION,"tongues, and that it now exists in forms of great beauty among many"
220,INTRODUCTION,far-away peoples who never heard of our special rules.
221,INTRODUCTION,
222,INTRODUCTION,Perhaps the first of these disturbing influences from afar to be felt in
223,INTRODUCTION,"modern English poetry was the Celtic renascence, the wonderful revival"
224,INTRODUCTION,"of interest in old Irish song, which became manifest in translations and"
225,INTRODUCTION,"adaptations of the ancient Gaelic lyrics and epics, made by W. B. Yeats,"
226,INTRODUCTION,"Lady Gregory, Douglas Hyde and others."
227,INTRODUCTION,
228,INTRODUCTION,"This influence was most powerful because it came to us directly, not at"
229,INTRODUCTION,"second-hand, through the English work of two poets of genius, Synge and"
230,INTRODUCTION,"Yeats. These great men, fortified and inspired by the simplicity and"
231,INTRODUCTION,"clarity of primitive Celtic song, had little patience with the"
232,INTRODUCTION,“over-appareled” art of Tennyson and his imitators. They found it
233,INTRODUCTION,"stiffened by rhetoric, by a too conscious morality leading to pulpit"
234,INTRODUCTION,"eloquence, and by second-hand bookish inspirations; and its movement"
235,INTRODUCTION,"they found hampered, thwarted of freedom, by a too slavish acceptance of"
236,INTRODUCTION,"ready-made schemes of metre and rhyme. The surprises and irregularities,"
237,INTRODUCTION,"found in all great art because they are inherent in human feeling, were"
238,INTRODUCTION,"being ruled out of English poetry, which consequently was stiffening"
239,INTRODUCTION,into forms too fixed and becoming more and more remote from life. As Mr.
240,INTRODUCTION,Yeats said in Chicago:
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,“We were weary of all this. We wanted to get rid not only of rhetoric
243,INTRODUCTION,but of poetic diction. We tried to strip away everything that was
244,INTRODUCTION,"artificial, to get a style like speech, as simple as the simplest prose,"
245,INTRODUCTION,like a cry of the heart.”
246,INTRODUCTION,
247,INTRODUCTION,It is scarcely too much to say that “the new poetry”—if we may be
248,INTRODUCTION,allowed the phrase—began with these two great Irish masters. Think what
249,INTRODUCTION,a contrast to even the simplest lyrics of Tennyson the pattern of their
250,INTRODUCTION,"songs presents, and what a contrast their direct outright human feeling"
251,INTRODUCTION,"presents to the somewhat culture-developed optimism of Browning, and the"
252,INTRODUCTION,science-inspired pessimism of Arnold. Compared with these Irishmen the
253,INTRODUCTION,best of their predecessors seem literary. This statement does not imply
254,INTRODUCTION,"any measure of ultimate values, for it is still too early to estimate"
255,INTRODUCTION,"them. One may, for example, believe Synge to be the greatest"
256,INTRODUCTION,"poet-playwright in English since Shakespeare, and one of the great poets"
257,INTRODUCTION,of the world; but a few more decades must pass before such ranking can
258,INTRODUCTION,have authority.
259,INTRODUCTION,
260,INTRODUCTION,At the same time other currents were influencing progressive minds
261,INTRODUCTION,"toward even greater freedom of form. Strangely enough, Whitman’s"
262,INTRODUCTION,"influence was felt first in France. It reached England, and finally"
263,INTRODUCTION,"America, indirectly from Paris, where the poets, stimulated by"
264,INTRODUCTION,"translations of the great American, especially Bajazette’s, and by the"
265,INTRODUCTION,"ever-adventurous quality of French scholarship, have been experimenting"
266,INTRODUCTION,with free verse ever since Mallarmé. The great Irish poets felt the
267,INTRODUCTION,French influence—it was part of the education which made them realize
268,INTRODUCTION,"that English poetry had become narrow, rigid, and insular. Yeats has"
269,INTRODUCTION,"held usually, though never slavishly, to rhyme and a certain regularity"
270,INTRODUCTION,"of metrical form—in which, however, he makes his own tunes; but Synge"
271,INTRODUCTION,"wrote his plays in that wide borderland between prose and verse, in a"
272,INTRODUCTION,"form which, whatever one calls it, is essentially poetry, for it has"
273,INTRODUCTION,"passion, glamour, magic, rhythm, and glorious imaginative life."
274,INTRODUCTION,
275,INTRODUCTION,This borderland between prose and verse is being explored now as never
276,INTRODUCTION,"before in English; except, perhaps in the King James translation of the"
277,INTRODUCTION,"Bible. The modern “vers-libertines,” as they have been wittily called,"
278,INTRODUCTION,are doing pioneer work in an heroic effort to get rid of obstacles that
279,INTRODUCTION,have hampered the poet and separated him from his audience. They are
280,INTRODUCTION,trying to make the modern manifestations of poetry less a matter of
281,INTRODUCTION,"rules and formulæ, and more a thing of the spirit, and of organic as"
282,INTRODUCTION,"against imposed, rhythm. In this enthusiastic labor they are following"
283,INTRODUCTION,"not only a strong inward impulse, not only the love of freedom which"
284,INTRODUCTION,"Chaucer followed—and Spenser and Shakespeare, Shelley and Coleridge and"
285,INTRODUCTION,all the masters—but they are moved also by influences from afar. They
286,INTRODUCTION,"have studied the French _symbolistes_ of the ’nineties, and the more"
287,INTRODUCTION,"recent Parisian _vers-libristes_. Moreover, some of them have listened"
288,INTRODUCTION,"to the pure lyricism of the Provençal troubadours, have studied the more"
289,INTRODUCTION,"elaborate mechanism of early Italian sonneteers and canzonists, have"
290,INTRODUCTION,"read Greek poetry from a new angle of vision; and last, but perhaps most"
291,INTRODUCTION,"important of all, have bowed to winds from the East."
292,INTRODUCTION,
293,INTRODUCTION,In the nineteenth century the western world—the western æsthetic
294,INTRODUCTION,world—discovered the orient. Someone has said that when Perry knocked at
295,INTRODUCTION,"the gates of Japan, these opened, not to let us in, but to let the"
296,INTRODUCTION,"Japanese out. Japanese graphic art, especially, began almost at once to"
297,INTRODUCTION,"kindle progressive minds. Whistler, of course, was the first great"
298,INTRODUCTION,creative artist to feel the influence of their instinct for balance and
299,INTRODUCTION,"proportion, for subtle harmonies of color and line, for the integrity of"
300,INTRODUCTION,beauty in art as opposed to the moralizing and sentimental tendencies
301,INTRODUCTION,which had been intruding more and more.
302,INTRODUCTION,
303,INTRODUCTION,"Poetry was slower than the graphic arts to feel the oriental influence,"
304,INTRODUCTION,because of the barrier of language. But European scholarship had long
305,INTRODUCTION,"dabbled with Indian, Persian and Sanskrit literatures, and Fitzgerald"
306,INTRODUCTION,even won over the crowd to some remote suspicion of their beauty by
307,INTRODUCTION,"meeting Omar half-way, and making a great poem out of the marriage, not"
308,INTRODUCTION,"only of two minds, but of two literary traditions. Then a few airs from"
309,INTRODUCTION,Japan blew in—a few translations of _hokku_ and other forms—which showed
310,INTRODUCTION,the stark simplicity and crystal clarity of the art among Japanese
311,INTRODUCTION,poets. And of late the search has gone further: we begin to discover a
312,INTRODUCTION,whole royal line of Chinese poets of a thousand or more years ago; and
313,INTRODUCTION,we are trying to search out the secrets of their delicate and beautiful
314,INTRODUCTION,"art. The task is difficult, because our poets, ignorant of Chinese, have"
315,INTRODUCTION,to get at these masters through the literal translations of scholars.
316,INTRODUCTION,"But even by this round-about way, poets like Allen Upward, Ezra Pound,"
317,INTRODUCTION,"Helen Waddell and a few others, give us something of the rare flavor,"
318,INTRODUCTION,"the special exquisite perfume, of the original. And of late the Indian"
319,INTRODUCTION,"influence has been emphasized by the great Bengali poet and sage,"
320,INTRODUCTION,"Rabindranath Tagore, whose mastery of English makes him a poet in two"
321,INTRODUCTION,languages.
322,INTRODUCTION,
323,INTRODUCTION,This oriental influence is to be welcomed because it flows from deep
324,INTRODUCTION,original streams of poetic art. We should not be afraid to learn from
325,INTRODUCTION,"it; and in much of the work of the imagists, and other radical groups,"
326,INTRODUCTION,"we find a more or less conscious, and more or less effective, yielding"
327,INTRODUCTION,to that influence. We find something of the oriental directness of
328,INTRODUCTION,"vision and simplicity of diction, also now and then a hint of the"
329,INTRODUCTION,unobtrusive oriental perfection of form and delicacy of feeling.
330,INTRODUCTION,
331,INTRODUCTION,"All these influences, which tend to make the art of poetry, especially"
332,INTRODUCTION,"poetry in English, less provincial, more cosmopolitan, are by no means a"
333,INTRODUCTION,"defiance of the classic tradition. On the contrary, they are an endeavor"
334,INTRODUCTION,"to return to it at its great original sources, and to sweep away"
335,INTRODUCTION,artificial laws—the _obiter dicta_ of secondary minds—which have
336,INTRODUCTION,"encumbered it. There is more of the great authentic classic tradition,"
337,INTRODUCTION,"for example, in the _Spoon River Anthology_ than in the _Idylls of the"
338,INTRODUCTION,"King_, _Balaustian’s Adventure_, and _Sohrab and Rustum_ combined. And"
339,INTRODUCTION,"the free rhythms of Whitman, Mallarmé, Pound, Sandburg and others, in"
340,INTRODUCTION,"their inspired passages, are more truly in line with the biblical, the"
341,INTRODUCTION,"Greek, the Anglo-Saxon, and even the Shakespearean tradition, than all"
342,INTRODUCTION,"the exact iambics of Dryden and Pope, the patterned alexandrines of"
343,INTRODUCTION,"Racine, or the closely woven metrics of Tennyson and Swinburne."
344,INTRODUCTION,
345,INTRODUCTION,"Whither the new movement is leading no one can tell with exactness, nor"
346,INTRODUCTION,which of its present manifestations in England and America will prove
347,INTRODUCTION,permanently valuable. But we may be sure that the movement is toward
348,INTRODUCTION,"greater freedom of spirit and form, and a more enlightened recognition"
349,INTRODUCTION,"of the international scope, the cosmopolitanism, of the great art of"
350,INTRODUCTION,"poetry, of which the English language, proud as its record is, offers"
351,INTRODUCTION,"but a single phase. As part of such a movement, even the most"
352,INTRODUCTION,"extravagant experiments, the most radical innovations, are valuable, for"
353,INTRODUCTION,"the moment at least, as an assault against prejudice. And some of the"
354,INTRODUCTION,"radicals of to-day will be, no doubt, the masters of to-morrow—a"
355,INTRODUCTION,phenomenon common in the history of the arts.

358,INTRODUCTION,
359,INTRODUCTION,"It remains only to explain the plan of this anthology, its inclusions"
360,INTRODUCTION,and omissions.
361,INTRODUCTION,
362,INTRODUCTION,"It has seemed best to include no poems published before 1900, even"
363,INTRODUCTION,"though, as in a few cases, the poets were moved by the new impulses. For"
364,INTRODUCTION,"example, those two intensely modern, nobly impassioned, lyric poets,"
365,INTRODUCTION,Emily Dickinson and the Shropshire Lad (Alfred Edward Housman)—the one
366,INTRODUCTION,"dead, the other fortunately still living—both belong, by date of"
367,INTRODUCTION,"publication, to the ’nineties. The work of poets already, as it were,"
368,INTRODUCTION,"enshrined—whether by fame, or death, or both—has also not been quoted:"
369,INTRODUCTION,"poets whose works are already, in a certain sense, classics, and whose"
370,INTRODUCTION,books are treasured by all lovers of the art—like Synge and Moody and
371,INTRODUCTION,"Riley, too early gone from us, and William Butler Yeats, whose later"
372,INTRODUCTION,"verse is governed, even more than his earlier, by the new austerities."
373,INTRODUCTION,
374,INTRODUCTION,"Certain other omissions are more difficult to explain, because they may"
375,INTRODUCTION,be thought to imply a lack of consideration which we do not feel. The
376,INTRODUCTION,"present Laureate, Robert Bridges, even in the late ’eighties and early"
377,INTRODUCTION,"’nineties, was led by his own personal taste, especially in his _Shorter"
378,INTRODUCTION,"Poems_, toward austere simplicity of subject, diction and style. But his"
379,INTRODUCTION,most representative poems were written before 1900. Rudyard Kipling has
380,INTRODUCTION,"been inspired at times by the modern muse, but his best poems also"
381,INTRODUCTION,antedate 1900. This is true also of Louise Imogen Guiney and Bliss
382,INTRODUCTION,"Carman, though most of their work, like that of Arthur Symons and the"
383,INTRODUCTION,"late Stephen Phillips and Anna Hempstead Branch, belongs, by its"
384,INTRODUCTION,"affinities, to the earlier period. And Alfred Noyes, whatever the date"
385,INTRODUCTION,"of his poems, bears no immediate relation to the more progressive modern"
386,INTRODUCTION,movement in the art.
387,INTRODUCTION,
388,INTRODUCTION,"On the other hand, we have tried to be hospitable to the adventurous,"
389,INTRODUCTION,"the experimental, because these are the qualities of pioneers, who look"
390,INTRODUCTION,"forward, not backward, and who may lead on, further than we can see as"
391,INTRODUCTION,"yet, to new domains of the ever-conquering spirit of beauty."

397,_H. M._,"kindly lend us their work. For example, sonnets are printed with or"
398,_H. M._,without indention according to the individual preference of the poet;
399,_H. M._,"also other rhymed forms, such as quatrains rhyming alternately; as"
400,_H. M._,well as various forms of free verse. Punctuation and spelling are more
401,_H. M._,"uniform, although a certain liberty has been conceded in words like_"
402,_H. M._,"gray _or_ grey, _the color of which seems to vary with the spelling,"
403,_H. M._,"and in the use of dots, dashes, commas, colons, etc._"

1089,DEAD CLEOPATRA,"Her tatbebs, it is said, are worn with sands."

1100,DEAD CLEOPATRA,
1101,DEAD CLEOPATRA,"If she had not been wrapped and spiced so shrewdly,"

1104,DEAD CLEOPATRA,"Had he been moved to ecstasy, or tears?"
1105,DEAD CLEOPATRA,

1328,CHORICOS,"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,"
1329,CHORICOS,Regretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings—
1330,CHORICOS,Symbols of ancient songs
1331,CHORICOS,Mournfully passing
1332,CHORICOS,"Down to the great white surges,"
1333,CHORICOS,Watched of none

1335,CHORICOS,"And the lithe pale girls,"

1338,CHORICOS,And the songs pass
1339,CHORICOS,From the green land
1340,CHORICOS,Which lies upon the waves as a leaf
1341,CHORICOS,On the flowers of hyacinth;
1342,CHORICOS,"And they pass from the waters,"
1343,CHORICOS,"The manifold winds and the dim moon,"
1344,CHORICOS,"And they come,"
1345,CHORICOS,"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,"
1346,CHORICOS,To the quiet level lands
1347,CHORICOS,"That she keeps for us all,"
1348,CHORICOS,That she wrought for us all for sleep
1349,CHORICOS,In the silver days of the earth’s dawning—

1356,CHORICOS,"And the hills that we loved and the meads,"
1357,CHORICOS,"And we turn from the fiery day,"
1358,CHORICOS,And the lips that were over-sweet;
1359,CHORICOS,For silently
1360,CHORICOS,"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,"
1361,CHORICOS,With purple robe
1362,CHORICOS,"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,"
1363,CHORICOS,"Death,"

1371,CHORICOS,"Death,"
1372,CHORICOS,"That we turn to thee, singing"
1373,CHORICOS,One last song.
1374,CHORICOS,
1375,CHORICOS,"O Death,"
1376,CHORICOS,Thou art an healing wind
1377,CHORICOS,That blowest over white flowers
1378,CHORICOS,A-tremble with dew;
1379,CHORICOS,Thou art a wind flowing
1380,CHORICOS,Over long leagues of lonely sea;
1381,CHORICOS,Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
1382,CHORICOS,Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
1383,CHORICOS,Thou art the pale peace of one
1384,CHORICOS,Satiate with old desires;
1385,CHORICOS,"Thou art the silence of beauty,"
1386,CHORICOS,And we look no more for the morning;
1387,CHORICOS,"We yearn no more for the sun,"
1388,CHORICOS,"Since with thy white hands,"
1389,CHORICOS,"Death,"
1390,CHORICOS,"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,"
1391,CHORICOS,The slim colorless poppies
1392,CHORICOS,Which in thy garden alone
1393,CHORICOS,Softly thou gatherest.
1394,CHORICOS,
1395,CHORICOS,And silently;
1396,CHORICOS,And with slow feet approaching;
1397,CHORICOS,"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,"
1398,CHORICOS,We kneel before thee.
1399,CHORICOS,"And thou, leaning towards us,"
1400,CHORICOS,Caressingly layest upon us
1401,CHORICOS,"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,"
1402,CHORICOS,"And, smiling as a chaste woman"
1403,CHORICOS,"Knowing love in her heart,"

1434,BARBERRIES,I love them best then.
1435,BARBERRIES,There is something splendid about them:
1436,BARBERRIES,They are not afraid
1437,BARBERRIES,Of being warm and glad and bold;
1438,BARBERRIES,"They flush joyously,"
1439,BARBERRIES,Like a cheek under a lover’s kiss;
1440,BARBERRIES,They bleed cruelly
1441,BARBERRIES,Like a dagger wound in the breast;
1442,BARBERRIES,"They flame up madly for their little hour,"
1443,BARBERRIES,Knowing they must die.

1760,THE FALCONER OF GOD,My wild soul waited on as falcons hover.
1761,THE FALCONER OF GOD,I beat the reedy fens as I trampled past.
1762,THE FALCONER OF GOD,I heard the mournful loon
1763,THE FALCONER OF GOD,In the marsh beneath the moon.
1764,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"And then, with feathery thunder, the bird of my desire"
1765,THE FALCONER OF GOD,Broke from the cover
1766,THE FALCONER OF GOD,Flashing silver fire.
1767,THE FALCONER OF GOD,High up among the stars I saw his pinions spire.
1768,THE FALCONER OF GOD,The pale clouds gazed aghast
1769,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"As my falcon stooped upon him, and gript and held him fast."
1770,THE FALCONER OF GOD,
1771,THE FALCONER OF GOD,My soul dropped through the air—with heavenly plunder?—
1772,THE FALCONER OF GOD,Gripping the dazzling bird my dreaming knew?
1773,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"Nay! but a piteous freight,"
1774,THE FALCONER OF GOD,A dark and heavy weight
1775,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"Despoiled of silver plumage, its voice forever stilled—"
1776,THE FALCONER OF GOD,All of the wonder
1777,THE FALCONER OF GOD,Gone that ever filled
1778,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"Its guise with glory. O bird that I have killed,"
1779,THE FALCONER OF GOD,How brilliantly you flew
1780,THE FALCONER OF GOD,Across my rapturous vision when first I dreamed of you!
1781,THE FALCONER OF GOD,
1782,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"Yet I fling my soul on high with new endeavor,"
1783,THE FALCONER OF GOD,And I ride the world below with a joyful mind.
1784,THE FALCONER OF GOD,_I shall start a heron soon
1785,THE FALCONER OF GOD,In the marsh beneath the moon—
1786,THE FALCONER OF GOD,A wondrous silver heron its inner darkness fledges!_
1787,THE FALCONER OF GOD,I beat forever
1788,THE FALCONER OF GOD,The fens and the sedges.
1789,THE FALCONER OF GOD,"The pledge is still the same—for all disastrous pledges,"
1790,THE FALCONER OF GOD,All hopes resigned!
1791,THE FALCONER OF GOD,My soul still flies above me for the quarry it shall find!

1795,THE HORSE THIEF,
1796,THE HORSE THIEF,"There he moved, cropping the grass at the purple canyon’s lip."
1797,THE HORSE THIEF,His mane was mixed with the moonlight that silvered his snow-white
1798,THE HORSE THIEF,"side,"
1799,THE HORSE THIEF,For the moon sailed out of a cloud with the wake of a spectral ship.
1800,THE HORSE THIEF,"I crouched and I crawled on my belly, my lariat coil looped wide."
1801,THE HORSE THIEF,
1802,THE HORSE THIEF,Dimly and dark the mesas broke on the starry sky.
1803,THE HORSE THIEF,A pall covered every color of their gorgeous glory at noon.
1804,THE HORSE THIEF,"I smelt the yucca and mesquite, and stifled my heart’s quick cry,"
1805,THE HORSE THIEF,And wormed and crawled on my belly to where he moved against the moon!
1806,THE HORSE THIEF,
1807,THE HORSE THIEF,Some Moorish barb was that mustang’s sire. His lines were beyond all
1808,THE HORSE THIEF,wonder.
1809,THE HORSE THIEF,From the prick of his ears to the flow of his tail he ached in my
1810,THE HORSE THIEF,throat and eyes.
1811,THE HORSE THIEF,"Steel and velvet grace! As the prophet says, God had “clothed his neck"
1812,THE HORSE THIEF,with thunder.”
1813,THE HORSE THIEF,"Oh, marvelous with the drifting cloud he drifted across the skies!"
1814,THE HORSE THIEF,
1815,THE HORSE THIEF,"And then I was near at hand—crouched, and balanced, and cast the coil;"
1816,THE HORSE THIEF,"And the moon was smothered in cloud, and the rope through my hands"
1817,THE HORSE THIEF,with a rip!
1818,THE HORSE THIEF,"But somehow I gripped and clung, with the blood in my brain aboil,—"
1819,THE HORSE THIEF,With a turn round the rugged tree-stump there on the purple canyon’s
1820,THE HORSE THIEF,lip.
1821,THE HORSE THIEF,
1822,THE HORSE THIEF,
1823,THE HORSE THIEF,"Right into the stars he reared aloft, his red eye rolling and raging."
1824,THE HORSE THIEF,"He whirled and sunfished and lashed, and rocked the earth to thunder"
1825,THE HORSE THIEF,and flame.
1826,THE HORSE THIEF,He squealed like a regular devil horse. I was haggard and spent and
1827,THE HORSE THIEF,aging—
1828,THE HORSE THIEF,"Roped clean, but almost storming clear, his fury too fierce to tame."
1829,THE HORSE THIEF,
1830,THE HORSE THIEF,"And I cursed myself for a tenderfoot moon-dazzled to play the part,"
1831,THE HORSE THIEF,"But I was doubly desperate then, with the posse pulled out from town,"
1832,THE HORSE THIEF,Or I’d never have tried it. I only knew I must get a mount and a start.
1833,THE HORSE THIEF,The filly had snapped her foreleg short. I had had to shoot her down.
1834,THE HORSE THIEF,
1835,THE HORSE THIEF,"So there he struggled and strangled, and I snubbed him around the tree."
1836,THE HORSE THIEF,"Nearer, a little nearer—hoofs planted, and lolling tongue—"
1837,THE HORSE THIEF,Till a sudden slack pitched me backward. He reared right on top of me.
1838,THE HORSE THIEF,Mother of God—that moment! He missed me ... and up I swung.
1839,THE HORSE THIEF,
1840,THE HORSE THIEF,"Somehow, gone daft completely and clawing a bunch of his mane,"
1841,THE HORSE THIEF,"As he stumbled and tripped in the lariat, there I was—up and astride"
1842,THE HORSE THIEF,And cursing for seven counties! And the mustang? _Just insane!_
1843,THE HORSE THIEF,"Crack-bang! went the rope; we cannoned off the tree—then—gods, that"
1844,THE HORSE THIEF,ride!
1845,THE HORSE THIEF,
1846,THE HORSE THIEF,"A rocket—that’s all, a rocket! I dug with my teeth and nails."
1847,THE HORSE THIEF,"Why, we never hit even the high spots (though I hardly remember"
1848,THE HORSE THIEF,"things),"
1849,THE HORSE THIEF,But I heard a monstrous booming like a thunder of flapping sails
1850,THE HORSE THIEF,"When he spread—well, _call_ me a liar!—when he spread those wings,"
1851,THE HORSE THIEF,those wings!
1852,THE HORSE THIEF,
1853,THE HORSE THIEF,
1854,THE HORSE THIEF,"So white that my eyes were blinded, thick-feathered and wide unfurled"
1855,THE HORSE THIEF,"They beat the air into billows. We sailed, and the earth was gone."
1856,THE HORSE THIEF,"Canyon and desert and mesa withered below, with the world."
1857,THE HORSE THIEF,And then I knew that mustang; for I—was Bellerophon!
1858,THE HORSE THIEF,
1859,THE HORSE THIEF,"Yes, glad as the Greek, and mounted on a horse of the elder gods,"
1860,THE HORSE THIEF,With never a magic bridle or a fountain-mirror nigh!
1861,THE HORSE THIEF,_My chaps and spurs and holster must have looked it?_ What’s the odds?
1862,THE HORSE THIEF,"I’d a leg over lightning and thunder, careering across the sky!"
1863,THE HORSE THIEF,
1864,THE HORSE THIEF,"And forever streaming before me, fanning my forehead cool,"
1865,THE HORSE THIEF,Flowed a mane of molten silver; and just before my thighs
1866,THE HORSE THIEF,"(As I gripped his velvet-muscled ribs, while I cursed myself for a"
1867,THE HORSE THIEF,"fool),"
1868,THE HORSE THIEF,The steady pulse of those pinions—their wonderful fall and rise!
1869,THE HORSE THIEF,
1870,THE HORSE THIEF,The bandanna I bought in Bowie blew loose and whipped from my neck.
1871,THE HORSE THIEF,My shirt was stuck to my shoulders and ribboning out behind.
1872,THE HORSE THIEF,"The stars were dancing, wheeling and glancing, dipping with smirk and"
1873,THE HORSE THIEF,beck.
1874,THE HORSE THIEF,"The clouds were flowing, dusking and glowing. We rode a roaring wind."
1875,THE HORSE THIEF,
1876,THE HORSE THIEF,We soared through the silver starlight to knock at the planets’ gates.
1877,THE HORSE THIEF,New shimmering constellations came whirling into our ken.
1878,THE HORSE THIEF,Red stars and green and golden swung out of the void that waits
1879,THE HORSE THIEF,For man’s great last adventure; the Signs took shape—and then
1880,THE HORSE THIEF,
1881,THE HORSE THIEF,I knew the lines of that Centaur the moment I saw him come!
1882,THE HORSE THIEF,The musical-box of the heavens all around us rolled to a tune
1883,THE HORSE THIEF,That tinkled and chimed and trilled with silver sounds that struck you
1884,THE HORSE THIEF,"dumb,"
1885,THE HORSE THIEF,As if some archangel were grinding out the music of the moon.
1886,THE HORSE THIEF,
1887,THE HORSE THIEF,
1888,THE HORSE THIEF,"Melody-drunk on the Milky Way, as we swept and soared hilarious,"
1889,THE HORSE THIEF,"Full in our pathway, sudden he stood—the Centaur of the Stars,"
1890,THE HORSE THIEF,Flashing from head and hoofs and breast! I knew him for Sagittarius.
1891,THE HORSE THIEF,"He reared, and bent and drew his bow. He crouched as a boxer spars."
1892,THE HORSE THIEF,
1893,THE HORSE THIEF,"Flung back on his haunches, weird he loomed—then leapt—and the dim void"
1894,THE HORSE THIEF,lightened.
1895,THE HORSE THIEF,"Old White Wings shied and swerved aside, and fled from the"
1896,THE HORSE THIEF,splendor-shod.
1897,THE HORSE THIEF,Through a flashing welter of worlds we charged. I knew why my horse was
1898,THE HORSE THIEF,frightened.
1899,THE HORSE THIEF,He _had_ two faces—a dog’s and a man’s—that Babylonian god!
1900,THE HORSE THIEF,
1901,THE HORSE THIEF,"Also, he followed us real as fear. Ping! went an arrow past."
1902,THE HORSE THIEF,"My broncho buck-jumped, humping high. We plunged ... I guess that’s"
1903,THE HORSE THIEF,all!
1904,THE HORSE THIEF,"I lay on the purple canyon’s lip, when I opened my eyes at last—"
1905,THE HORSE THIEF,"Stiff and sore and my head like a drum, but I broke no bones in the"
1906,THE HORSE THIEF,fall.
1907,THE HORSE THIEF,
1908,THE HORSE THIEF,So you know—and now you may string me up. Such was the way you caught

1910,THE HORSE THIEF,"Thank you for letting me tell it straight, though you never could"
1911,THE HORSE THIEF,greatly care.
1912,THE HORSE THIEF,For I took a horse that wasn’t mine!... But there’s one the heavens
1913,THE HORSE THIEF,"brought me,"
1914,THE HORSE THIEF,"And I’ll hang right happy, because I know he is waiting for me up"

1916,THE HORSE THIEF,
1917,THE HORSE THIEF,"From creamy muzzle to cannon-bone, by God, he’s a peerless wonder!"

2851,POLONIUS AND THE BALLAD SINGERS,But they are all in the convention of songs still sung by strolling

2854,POLONIUS AND THE BALLAD SINGERS,"Burns, using the word in the same sense, writes it. “Paurk” or “park” is"
2855,POLONIUS AND THE BALLAD SINGERS,"Gaelic for pasture field, and is always used in Irish country speech in"

3928,THE TEMPLE,"Hear me, brother!"
3929,THE TEMPLE,"Boldly I stepped into the Temple,"
3930,THE TEMPLE,Into the Temple where the God dwells
3931,THE TEMPLE,"Veiled with Seven Veils,"
3932,THE TEMPLE,Into the Temple of Unbroken Silence:
3933,THE TEMPLE,And my joyous feet shod with crimson sandals
3934,THE TEMPLE,"Rang out on the tesselated pavement,"
3935,THE TEMPLE,Rang out fearlessly
3936,THE TEMPLE,Like a challenge and a cry!
3937,THE TEMPLE,"And there—in that shrouded solitude,"
3938,THE TEMPLE,"There—before the Seven Veils,"
3939,THE TEMPLE,"There—because of youth and youth’s madness,"
3940,THE TEMPLE,"Because of love and love’s unresting heart,"
3941,THE TEMPLE,There did I sing three songs!
3942,THE TEMPLE,And my first song praised the eyes of a wanton;
3943,THE TEMPLE,And my second song praised the lips of a wanton;
3944,THE TEMPLE,And my third song praised the feet of a dancing girl!
3945,THE TEMPLE,
3946,THE TEMPLE,"Thus did I desecrate the Temple,"
3947,THE TEMPLE,"Thus did I stand before the Seven Veils,"
3948,THE TEMPLE,Proudly!
3949,THE TEMPLE,Thus did I wait upon the God’s Voice—
3950,THE TEMPLE,Proudly!—
3951,THE TEMPLE,And the sudden shaft of death....
3952,THE TEMPLE,
3953,THE TEMPLE,"But no Voice stirred the Seven Veils,"
3954,THE TEMPLE,Though I stood long....
3955,THE TEMPLE,
3956,THE TEMPLE,"And my knees shook,"
3957,THE TEMPLE,My bones were afraid....
3958,THE TEMPLE,
3959,THE TEMPLE,"Swiftly I loosed the crimson sandals,"
3960,THE TEMPLE,"And, tearing them from off my feet,"
3961,THE TEMPLE,Crept shuddering forth!
3962,THE TEMPLE,
3963,THE TEMPLE,"Hear me, brother!"
3964,THE TEMPLE,"Now am I as one stricken with palsy,"
3965,THE TEMPLE,"Now am I sick with the close ache of terror,"
3966,THE TEMPLE,"Now am I as one who, having tasted poison,"
3967,THE TEMPLE,"Cowers, waiting for the pang!"
3968,THE TEMPLE,
3969,THE TEMPLE,_For the God spake not...._
3970,THE TEMPLE,
3971,THE TEMPLE,And the sense of my littleness is upon me:
3972,THE TEMPLE,"And I am a worm in my own sight,"
3973,THE TEMPLE,Trodden and helpless;
3974,THE TEMPLE,A casual grain of sand
3975,THE TEMPLE,Indistinguishable amid a million grains:
3976,THE TEMPLE,And I take no pleasure now in youth
3977,THE TEMPLE,"Nor in youth’s madness,"
3978,THE TEMPLE,In love
3979,THE TEMPLE,Nor in love’s unresting heart;
3980,THE TEMPLE,"And I praise no longer the eyes of a wanton,"
3981,THE TEMPLE,"Nor the lips of a wanton,"
3982,THE TEMPLE,Nor the light feet of a dancing girl.

4405,I,I
4406,I,
4407,I,Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
4408,I,You have the scene arrange itself—as it will seem to do—
4409,I,With “I have saved this afternoon for you”;
4410,I,"And four wax candles in the darkened room,"
4411,I,Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead:
4412,I,An atmosphere of Juliet’s tomb
4413,I,"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid."
4414,I,
4415,I,"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole"
4416,I,"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips."
4417,I,"“So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul"
4418,I,Should be resurrected only among friends—
4419,I,"Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom"
4420,I,That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.”
4421,I,
4422,I,And so the conversation slips
4423,I,"Among velleities and carefully caught regrets,"
4424,I,Through attenuated tones of violins
4425,I,"Mingled with remote cornets,"
4426,I,And begins:
4427,I,"“You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends;"
4428,I,"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find,"
4429,I,"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends—"
4430,I,(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
4431,I,How keen you are!)
4432,I,"To find a friend who has these qualities,"
4433,I,"Who has, and gives"
4434,I,Those qualities upon which friendship lives:
4435,I,How much it means that I say this to you—
4436,I,"Without these friendships—life, what _cauchemar_!”"
4437,I,
4438,I,"Among the windings of the violins,"
4439,I,And the ariettes
4440,I,"Of cracked cornets,"
4441,I,Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
4442,I,Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own—
4443,I,Capricious monotone
4444,I,That is at least one definite “false note.”
4445,I,"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,"
4446,I,"Admire the monuments,"
4447,I,"Discuss the late events,"
4448,I,Correct our watches by the public clocks;
4449,I,Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.
4450,I,
4451,II,II
4452,II,
4453,II,Now that lilacs are in bloom
4454,II,She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
4455,II,And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
4456,II,"“Ah my friend, you do not know, you do not know"
4457,II,"What life is, you who hold it in your hands—”"
4458,II,(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks);
4459,II,"“You let it flow from you, you let it flow,"
4460,II,"And youth is cruel, and has no remorse,"
4461,II,And smiles at situations which it cannot see.”
4462,II,"I smile, of course,"
4463,II,And go on drinking tea.
4464,II,"“Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall"
4465,II,"My buried life, and Paris in the spring,"
4466,II,"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world"
4467,II,"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.”"
4468,II,
4469,II,The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
4470,II,Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
4471,II,“I am always sure that you understand
4472,II,"My feelings, always sure that you feel,"
4473,II,Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.
4474,II,
4475,II,"“You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles’ heel."
4476,II,"You will go on, and when you have prevailed"
4477,II,You can say: ‘At this point many a one has failed.’
4478,II,"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,"
4479,II,"To give you, what can you receive from me?"
4480,II,Only the friendship and the sympathy
4481,II,Of one about to reach her journey’s end.
4482,II,
4483,II,"“I shall sit here, serving tea to friends....”"
4484,II,
4485,II,I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
4486,II,For what she has said to me?
4487,II,
4488,II,You will see me any morning in the park
4489,II,Reading the comics and the sporting page.
4490,II,Particularly I remark
4491,II,"An English countess goes upon the stage,"
4492,II,"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,"
4493,II,Another bank defaulter has confessed.
4494,II,"I keep my countenance,"
4495,II,I remain self-possessed
4496,II,"Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired,"
4497,II,"Reiterates some worn-out common song,"
4498,II,With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
4499,II,Recalling things that other people have desired.
4500,II,Are these ideas right or wrong?
4501,II,
4502,III,III
4503,III,
4504,III,"The October night comes down. Returning as before,"
4505,III,"Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease,"
4506,III,I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
4507,III,And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
4508,III,
4509,III,“And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
4510,III,But that’s a useless question.
4511,III,"You hardly know when you are coming back,"
4512,III,You will find so much to learn.”
4513,III,My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.
4514,III,
4515,III,“Perhaps you can write to me.”
4516,III,My self-possession flares up for a second;
4517,III,_This_ is as I had reckoned.
4518,III,“I have been wondering frequently of late
4519,III,(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
4520,III,Why we have not developed into friends.”
4521,III,"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark"
4522,III,"Suddenly, his expression in a glass."
4523,III,My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.
4524,III,
4525,III,"“For everybody said so, all our friends,"
4526,III,They all were sure our feelings would relate
4527,III,So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
4528,III,We must leave it now to fate.
4529,III,"You will write, at any rate."
4530,III,Perhaps it is not too late.
4531,III,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.”"
4532,III,
4533,III,And I must borrow every changing shape
4534,III,"To find expression ... dance, dance"
4535,III,"Like a dancing bear,"
4536,III,"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape."
4537,III,"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance ..."
4538,III,"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,"
4539,III,"Afternoon gray and smoky, evening yellow and rose;"
4540,III,Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
4541,III,With the smoke coming down above the house tops;
4542,III,"Doubtful, for quite a while"
4543,III,Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
4544,III,"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon..."
4545,III,"Would she not have the advantage, after all?"
4546,III,This music is successful with a “dying fall”
4547,III,Now that we talk of dying—
4548,III,And should I have the right to smile?

5247,MENDING WALL,"To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,"
5248,MENDING WALL,"No one has seen them made or heard them made,"
5249,MENDING WALL,But at spring mending-time we find them there.
5250,MENDING WALL,I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
5251,MENDING WALL,And on a day we meet to walk the line
5252,MENDING WALL,And set the wall between us once again.
5253,MENDING WALL,We keep the wall between us as we go.
5254,MENDING WALL,To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
5255,MENDING WALL,And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
5256,MENDING WALL,We have to use a spell to make them balance:
5257,MENDING WALL,“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”
5258,MENDING WALL,We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
5259,MENDING WALL,"Oh, just another kind of out-door game,"
5260,MENDING WALL,One on a side. It comes to little more:
5261,MENDING WALL,There where it is we do not need the wall:
5262,MENDING WALL,He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
5263,MENDING WALL,My apple trees will never get across
5264,MENDING WALL,"And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him."
5265,MENDING WALL,"He only says, “Good fences make good neighbors.”"
5266,MENDING WALL,"Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder"
5267,MENDING WALL,If I could put a notion in his head:
5268,MENDING WALL,“Why do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it
5269,MENDING WALL,Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
5270,MENDING WALL,Before I built a wall I’d ask to know
5271,MENDING WALL,"What I was walling in or walling out,"
5272,MENDING WALL,And to whom I was like to give offence.
5273,MENDING WALL,"Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,"
5274,MENDING WALL,"That wants it down.” I could say “Elves” to him,"
5275,MENDING WALL,"But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather"
5276,MENDING WALL,He said it for himself. I see him there
5277,MENDING WALL,Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
5278,MENDING WALL,"In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed."
5279,MENDING WALL,"He moves in darkness as it seems to me,"
5280,MENDING WALL,Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
5281,MENDING WALL,"He will not go behind his father’s saying,"
5282,MENDING WALL,And he likes having thought of it so well
5283,MENDING WALL,"He says again, “Good fences make good neighbors.”"

5294,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"Essence of winter sleep is on the night,"
5295,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
5296,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
5297,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I got from looking through a pane of glass
5298,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
5299,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,And held against the world of hoary grass.
5300,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"It melted, and I let it fall and break."
5301,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,But I was well
5302,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"Upon my way to sleep before it fell,"

5310,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
5311,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
5312,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,The rumbling sound
5313,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,Of load on load of apples coming in.
5314,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,For I have had too much
5315,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,Of apple-picking: I am overtired
5316,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,Of the great harvest I myself desired.
5317,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,"
5318,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall."
5319,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,For all
5320,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"That struck the earth,"
5321,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,"
5322,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,Went surely to the cider-apple heap
5323,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,As of no worth.
5324,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,One can see what will trouble
5325,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is."
5326,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,"Were he not gone,"
5327,AFTER APPLE-PICKING,The woodchuck could say whether it’s like his

5363,MOWING,What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;
5364,MOWING,"Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,"
5365,MOWING,"Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound—"
5366,MOWING,And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
5367,MOWING,"It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,"
5368,MOWING,Or easy cold at the hand of fay or elf:
5369,MOWING,Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
5370,MOWING,To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows—
5371,MOWING,Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
5372,MOWING,(Pale orchises)—and scared a bright green snake.
5373,MOWING,The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.

5440,THE CODE—HEROICS,"One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,"
5441,THE CODE—HEROICS,Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.
5442,THE CODE—HEROICS,The town-bred farmer failed to understand.
5443,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5444,THE CODE—HEROICS,What was there wrong?
5445,THE CODE—HEROICS,Something you said just now.
5446,THE CODE—HEROICS,What did I say?
5447,THE CODE—HEROICS,About our taking pains.
5448,THE CODE—HEROICS,To cock the hay?—because it’s going to shower?
5449,THE CODE—HEROICS,I said that nearly half an hour ago.
5450,THE CODE—HEROICS,I said it to myself as much as you.
5451,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5452,THE CODE—HEROICS,You didn’t know. But James is one big fool.
5453,THE CODE—HEROICS,He thought you meant to find fault with his work.
5454,THE CODE—HEROICS,That’s what the average farmer would have meant.
5455,THE CODE—HEROICS,James had to take his time to chew it over
5456,THE CODE—HEROICS,Before he acted; he’s just got round to act.
5457,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5458,THE CODE—HEROICS,He _is_ a fool if that’s the way he takes me.
5459,THE CODE—HEROICS,Don’t let it bother you. You’ve found out something.
5460,THE CODE—HEROICS,The hand that knows his business won’t be told
5461,THE CODE—HEROICS,To do work faster or better—those two things.
5462,THE CODE—HEROICS,I’m as particular as anyone:
5463,THE CODE—HEROICS,Most likely I’d have served you just the same:
5464,THE CODE—HEROICS,But I know you don’t understand our ways.
5465,THE CODE—HEROICS,"You were just talking what was in your mind,"
5466,THE CODE—HEROICS,"What was in all our minds, and you weren’t hinting."
5467,THE CODE—HEROICS,Tell you a story of what happened once.
5468,THE CODE—HEROICS,"I was up here in Salem, at a man’s"
5469,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Named Sanders, with a gang of four or five,"
5470,THE CODE—HEROICS,Doing the haying. No one liked the boss.
5471,THE CODE—HEROICS,"He was one of the kind sports call a spider,"
5472,THE CODE—HEROICS,All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy
5473,THE CODE—HEROICS,From a humped body nigh as big as a biscuit.
5474,THE CODE—HEROICS,"But work!—that man could work, especially"
5475,THE CODE—HEROICS,If by so doing he could get more work
5476,THE CODE—HEROICS,Out of his hired help. I’m not denying
5477,THE CODE—HEROICS,He was hard on himself: I couldn’t find
5478,THE CODE—HEROICS,That he kept any hours—not for himself.
5479,THE CODE—HEROICS,Day-light and lantern-light were one to him:
5480,THE CODE—HEROICS,I’ve heard him pounding in the barn all night.
5481,THE CODE—HEROICS,But what he liked was someone to encourage.
5482,THE CODE—HEROICS,Them that he couldn’t lead he’d get behind
5483,THE CODE—HEROICS,"And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing—"
5484,THE CODE—HEROICS,Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.
5485,THE CODE—HEROICS,I’d seen about enough of his bulling tricks—
5486,THE CODE—HEROICS,We call that bulling. I’d been watching him.
5487,THE CODE—HEROICS,So when he paired off with me in the hayfield
5488,THE CODE—HEROICS,"To load the load, thinks I, look out for trouble!"
5489,THE CODE—HEROICS,I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders
5490,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Combed it down with the rake and said, “O. K.”"
5491,THE CODE—HEROICS,Everything went right till we reached the barn
5492,THE CODE—HEROICS,With a big take to empty in a bay.
5493,THE CODE—HEROICS,You understand that meant the easy job
5494,THE CODE—HEROICS,For the man up on top of throwing down
5495,THE CODE—HEROICS,"The hay and rolling it off wholesale,"
5496,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Where, on a mow, it would have been slow lifting."
5497,THE CODE—HEROICS,You wouldn’t think a fellow’d need much urging
5498,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Under those circumstances, would you now?"
5499,THE CODE—HEROICS,"But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,"
5500,THE CODE—HEROICS,"And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,"
5501,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Shouts like an army captain, “Let her come!”"
5502,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Thinks I, d’ye mean it? “What was that you said?”"
5503,THE CODE—HEROICS,I asked out loud so’s there’d be no mistake.
5504,THE CODE—HEROICS,"“Did you say, let her come?” “Yes, let her come.”"
5505,THE CODE—HEROICS,"He said it over, but he said it softer."
5506,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Never you say a thing like that to a man,"
5507,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Not if he values what he is. God, I’d as soon"
5508,THE CODE—HEROICS,Murdered him as left out his middle name.
5509,THE CODE—HEROICS,I’d built the load and knew just where to find it.
5510,THE CODE—HEROICS,Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for
5511,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Like meditating, and then I just dug in"
5512,THE CODE—HEROICS,And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.
5513,THE CODE—HEROICS,I looked over the side once in the dust
5514,THE CODE—HEROICS,"And caught sight of him treading-water-like,"
5515,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Keeping his head above. “Damn ye,” I says,"
5516,THE CODE—HEROICS,“That gets ye!” He squeaked like a squeezed rat.
5517,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5518,THE CODE—HEROICS,That was the last I saw or heard of him.
5519,THE CODE—HEROICS,I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.
5520,THE CODE—HEROICS,"As I sat mopping the hayseed from my neck,"
5521,THE CODE—HEROICS,"And sort of waiting to be asked about it,"
5522,THE CODE—HEROICS,"One of the boys sings out, “Where’s the old man?”"
5523,THE CODE—HEROICS,"“I left him in the barn, under the hay."
5524,THE CODE—HEROICS,If you want him you can go and dig him out.”
5525,THE CODE—HEROICS,They realized from the way I swobbed my neck
5526,THE CODE—HEROICS,"More than was needed, something must be up."
5527,THE CODE—HEROICS,They headed for the barn—I stayed where I was.
5528,THE CODE—HEROICS,"They told me afterward: First they forked hay,"
5529,THE CODE—HEROICS,"A lot of it, out into the barn floor."
5530,THE CODE—HEROICS,Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle!
5531,THE CODE—HEROICS,I guess they thought I’d spiked him in the temple
5532,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Before I buried him, else I couldn’t have managed."
5533,THE CODE—HEROICS,They excavated more. “Go keep his wife
5534,THE CODE—HEROICS,Out of the barn.”
5535,THE CODE—HEROICS,Some one looked in a window;
5536,THE CODE—HEROICS,"And curse me, if he wasn’t in the kitchen,"
5537,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet"
5538,THE CODE—HEROICS,"Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer."
5539,THE CODE—HEROICS,"He looked so mad in back, and so disgusted"
5540,THE CODE—HEROICS,There was no one that dared to stir him up
5541,THE CODE—HEROICS,Or let him know that he was being looked at.
5542,THE CODE—HEROICS,Apparently I hadn’t buried him
5543,THE CODE—HEROICS,"(I may have knocked him down), but just my trying"
5544,THE CODE—HEROICS,To bury him had hurt his dignity.
5545,THE CODE—HEROICS,He had gone to the house so’s not to face me.
5546,THE CODE—HEROICS,He kept away from us all afternoon.
5547,THE CODE—HEROICS,We tended to his hay. We saw him out
5548,THE CODE—HEROICS,After a while picking peas in the garden:
5549,THE CODE—HEROICS,He couldn’t keep away from doing something.
5550,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5551,THE CODE—HEROICS,Weren’t you relieved to find he wasn’t dead?
5552,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5553,THE CODE—HEROICS,No!—and yet I can’t say: it’s hard to tell.
5554,THE CODE—HEROICS,I went about to kill him fair enough.
5555,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5556,THE CODE—HEROICS,You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?
5557,THE CODE—HEROICS,
5558,THE CODE—HEROICS,Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right.

6341,I,An October like November;
6342,I,"August a hundred thousand hours,"
6343,I,"And all September,"
6344,I,"A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days,"
6345,I,And half October like a thousand years ...
6346,I,And doom!
6347,I,That then was Antwerp ...
6348,I,"In the name of God,"
6349,I,How could they do it?
6350,I,Those souls that usually dived
6351,I,Into the dirty caverns of mines;
6352,I,Who usually hived
6353,I,In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars;
6354,I,"Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud,"
6355,I,Lumbering to work over the greasy sods ...
6356,I,"Those men there, with the appearance of clods"
6357,I,Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God
6358,I,Ever shrived ...
6359,I,And it is not for us to make them an anthem.
6360,I,If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them
6361,I,"To a tune that the trumpets might blow it,"
6362,I,"Shrill through the heaven that’s ours or yet Allah’s,"
6363,I,Or the wide halls of any Valhallas.
6364,I,We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours
6365,I,"For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays"
6366,I,Is this:
6367,I,"“In the name of God, how could they do it?”"

6373,II,In the gloom....
6374,II,What the devil will he gain by it?
6375,II,Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it
6376,II,Waiting his doom;
6377,II,"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood"
6378,II,Till the trench of gray mud
6379,II,Is turned to a brown purple drain by it.
6380,II,"Well, there have been scars"

6387,II,"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession,"
6388,II,"Overspreading his miserable land,"
6389,II,Standing with his wet gun in his hand....
6390,II,Doom!
6391,II,"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage,"

6400,III,And battalions and battalions and battalions—
6401,III,"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo,"
6402,III,"Pass, for ever staunch,"
6403,III,"Stand, for ever true;"

6405,III,"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back,"
6406,III,Watches them pass
6407,III,In our minds for ever....

6417,IV,
6418,IV,And that is the highest word you can find to say of it.
6419,IV,For you cannot praise it with words
6420,IV,"Compounded of lyres and swords,"
6421,IV,But the thought of the gloom and the rain
6422,IV,"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain,"
6423,IV,Shall eat itself into your brain:
6424,IV,"And you will say of all heroes, “They fought like the Belgians!”"
6425,IV,"And you will say, “He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom.”"
6426,IV,"And you will say, “He bought like a Belgian"
6427,IV,His doom.”
6428,IV,And that shall be an honorable name;
6429,IV,“Belgian” shall be an honorable word;
6430,IV,"As honorable as the fame of the sword,"
6431,IV,"As honorable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre,"

6572,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6573,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"This is the song of youth,"
6574,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,This is the cause of myself;
6575,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"I knew my father well and he was a fool,"
6576,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Therefore will I have my own foot in the path before I take a step;
6577,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6578,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"I will go only into new lands,"
6579,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,And I will walk on no plank-walks.
6580,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"The horses of my family are wind-broken,"
6581,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"And the dogs are old,"
6582,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,And the guns rusty;
6583,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"I will make me a new bow from an ash-tree,"
6584,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,And cut up the homestead into arrows.
6585,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6586,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Behold how people stand around!
6587,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"(There are always crowds of people standing around,"
6588,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Whose legs have no knees)—
6589,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,While the engineers put up steel work ...
6590,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"Is it something to catch the sunlight,"
6591,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Jewelry and gew-gaw?
6592,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,I have no time to wait for them to build bridges for me;
6593,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"Where awful the gap seems stretching there is no gap,"
6594,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Leaping I take it at once from a thought to a thought.
6595,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,I can no more walk in the stride of other men
6596,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Than be father of their children.
6597,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6598,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"My treasure lured like a bright star,"
6599,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,And I went to it young and desirous.
6600,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"Lo, as it stood there in its great chests,"
6601,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"The wise men came up with the keys,"
6602,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"Crying, “Blasphemy, blasphemy!”"
6603,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,For I had broken the locks....
6604,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"And when the procession went waving to a funeral,"
6605,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,They cried it again;
6606,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,For I stayed in my home and spoke truth about the dead.
6607,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6608,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,Much did I learn waiting in my youth;
6609,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,At the door of a great man I waited on one foot and then on the other.
6610,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"The files passed in and out before me to the antechamber, for at that"
6611,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,door I was not favored:
6612,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,(O costly preferment!)
6613,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"Yet I watched them coming and going,"
6614,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,And I learned the great man by heart from the stories on their faces.
6615,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"When presently the retainers arrived, one above the other in a row,"
6616,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,saying:
6617,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"“The great man is ready,”"
6618,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,I had long been a greater than he.
6619,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6620,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,
6621,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,This is the reason for myself:
6622,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"When I used to go in the races, I had but one prayer,"
6623,I—THE SONG OF YOUTH,"And I went first before the judges, saying;"

6633,II—VIRGINS,"By contact with them I learn that each is a center,"

6642,III—NO PREY AM I,III—NO PREY AM I
6643,III—NO PREY AM I,
6644,III—NO PREY AM I,No prey am I of poor thoughts.
6645,III—NO PREY AM I,I leave all of my followers; I tire quickly of them;
6646,III—NO PREY AM I,I send them away from me when they ask too much; for though I live alone
6647,III—NO PREY AM I,"Still will I live, night and day ..."
6648,III—NO PREY AM I,
6649,III—NO PREY AM I,There is not anything in me save mutation and laughter;
6650,III—NO PREY AM I,"My laughter is like a sword,"
6651,III—NO PREY AM I,Like the piston-rod that defies oceans and grades.
6652,III—NO PREY AM I,
6653,III—NO PREY AM I,When I labor it is a song of battle in the broad noon;
6654,III—NO PREY AM I,For behold the muscles of a man—
6655,III—NO PREY AM I,"They are piston-rods; they are cranes, hydraulic presses,"
6656,III—NO PREY AM I,powder-magazines:
6657,III—NO PREY AM I,But though my body be as beautiful as a hill crowned with flowers
6658,III—NO PREY AM I,I will despise it and make it obey me ...
6659,III—NO PREY AM I,
6660,III—NO PREY AM I,Is the old love dead?
6661,III—NO PREY AM I,"Then I shall await the new,"
6662,III—NO PREY AM I,To embrace it more sturdily and passionately than ever the old;
6663,III—NO PREY AM I,And break it under the white force of my laughter
6664,III—NO PREY AM I,Until it lies passive in my arms.
6665,III—NO PREY AM I,There is nothing in me but renewal;
6666,III—NO PREY AM I,If my friend bow his head over me I soon surprise him with shouts of
6667,III—NO PREY AM I,joy:
6668,III—NO PREY AM I,"For in an instant I am again what I was,"
6669,III—NO PREY AM I,Only with a few moments more of the infusion of earth;
6670,III—NO PREY AM I,"I tell him, the griever, to follow me and he is a griever no more;"
6671,III—NO PREY AM I,He raises his head and must follow.
6672,III—NO PREY AM I,"Yet it is my battle, not his battle,"
6673,III—NO PREY AM I,For in me I absorb others ...
6674,III—NO PREY AM I,I hail parties and partisans from afar;
6675,III—NO PREY AM I,"Not men but parties are my comrades,"
6676,III—NO PREY AM I,Not persons but nations are my associates.
6677,III—NO PREY AM I,I shake the hand of nations;
6678,III—NO PREY AM I,"For I am a nation and a party, and majorities do not elect me—"
6679,III—NO PREY AM I,I elect myself.
6680,III—NO PREY AM I,"I swam in the sea, and lo!"
6681,III—NO PREY AM I,The continents assembled like islands off my coast.
6682,III—NO PREY AM I,"My talk is with Homer and Bonaparte, with David and Garibaldi, with"
6683,III—NO PREY AM I,China and Pharaoh and Texas;
6684,III—NO PREY AM I,When I laugh it is with Lucifer and Rabelais.
6685,III—NO PREY AM I,"A pathfinder is my mistress, one hard to keep and unbridled—"
6686,III—NO PREY AM I,I have no respect for tame women.
6687,III—NO PREY AM I,"My friends and I do not meet every day,"
6688,III—NO PREY AM I,"For we are centuries apart, our salutations girdle the globe."
6689,III—NO PREY AM I,
6690,III—NO PREY AM I,I have eaten locusts with Jeremiah;
6691,III—NO PREY AM I,I invite all hatreds and the stings of little creatures—
6692,III—NO PREY AM I,"They enrich me, I glory in my parasites."
6693,III—NO PREY AM I,
6694,III—NO PREY AM I,"No man shall ever read me,"
6695,III—NO PREY AM I,For I bring about in a gesture what they cannot fathom in a life;
6696,III—NO PREY AM I,Yet I tell Bob and Harry and Bill—
6697,III—NO PREY AM I,It costs me nothing to be kind;
6698,III—NO PREY AM I,"If I am a generous adversary, be not deceived, neither be devoted—"
6699,III—NO PREY AM I,It is because I despise you.
6700,III—NO PREY AM I,"Yet if any man claim to be my peer I shall meet him,"
6701,III—NO PREY AM I,For that man has an insolence that I like;
6702,III—NO PREY AM I,I am beholden to him.
6703,III—NO PREY AM I,"I know the lightning when I see it,"
6704,III—NO PREY AM I,And the toad when I see it...
6705,III—NO PREY AM I,I warn all pretenders.
6706,III—NO PREY AM I,"Yet before I came it was known of me to the chosen, all that I should"
6707,III—NO PREY AM I,do.
6708,III—NO PREY AM I,Every tree knew it;
6709,III—NO PREY AM I,Every lion and every leech knew it—
6710,III—NO PREY AM I,"And called out to meet the new enemy,"
6711,III—NO PREY AM I,The new friend...
6712,III—NO PREY AM I,What power can deny me?
6713,III—NO PREY AM I,"It was known that I should do not one thing but hundreds,"
6714,III—NO PREY AM I,For I despise my works and make them obey me.
6715,III—NO PREY AM I,I have my time and I bide it...
6716,III—NO PREY AM I,"It was known that I should turn no whit from my end, until I had"
6717,III—NO PREY AM I,attained it.
6718,III—NO PREY AM I,
6719,III—NO PREY AM I,"Nothing has scathed me,"
6720,III—NO PREY AM I,"Nothing ever, nor ever will."
6721,III—NO PREY AM I,"I have touched pitch, I have revelled in it and rolled in it;"
6722,III—NO PREY AM I,"Buried in mire and filth, I laughed long,"
6723,III—NO PREY AM I,And sprang up.
6724,III—NO PREY AM I,I have loved lust and vain deviltries.
6725,III—NO PREY AM I,And taken them into my heart—
6726,III—NO PREY AM I,
6727,III—NO PREY AM I,Their dirt and their lies—and my heart was aflame
6728,III—NO PREY AM I,With a new fancy...
6729,III—NO PREY AM I,Not me can pitch defile!
6730,III—NO PREY AM I,"For the Spring, my sister, rose under my feet"
6731,III—NO PREY AM I,"And I was again naked and white,"
6732,III—NO PREY AM I,"Ready to dive into the deep pool, green and bottomless,"
6733,III—NO PREY AM I,"The medium for heroes, since it is dangerous and beautiful—"
6734,III—NO PREY AM I,The pool of Tomorrow!
6735,III—NO PREY AM I,It is because I breathe like fishes and live in the waters of Tomorrow
6736,III—NO PREY AM I,that Death fears me...
6737,III—NO PREY AM I,
6738,III—NO PREY AM I,"How often I have intercepted thee, O Death!"
6739,III—NO PREY AM I,O windy liar!
6740,III—NO PREY AM I,Thou canst do nothing against me;
6741,III—NO PREY AM I,"If I command thee to stand back thou art afraid and cowerest,"
6742,III—NO PREY AM I,For I have caught thee often and punished thee...
6743,III—NO PREY AM I,
6744,III—NO PREY AM I,"I am the greatest laugher of all,"
6745,III—NO PREY AM I,"Greater than the sun and the oak-tree,"
6746,III—NO PREY AM I,Than the frog and Apollo;
6747,III—NO PREY AM I,I laugh all day long!
6748,III—NO PREY AM I,"I laugh at Death, I hail Death, I kiss her on the cheek as a lover his"
6749,III—NO PREY AM I,"bride,"
6750,III—NO PREY AM I,But the lover goes not to his bride unless he desire her;
6751,III—NO PREY AM I,I go not to Death until I am ready.
6752,III—NO PREY AM I,The strong lover goes not to his bride save when he would people his
6753,III—NO PREY AM I,land with sons;
6754,III—NO PREY AM I,"Then I, too, I go not to Death, save it be for the labor greater than"
6755,III—NO PREY AM I,all others.
6756,III—NO PREY AM I,I shall break her with my laughter;
6757,III—NO PREY AM I,I shall complete her...

6965,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,It is not you; why disguise yourself
6966,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"Against me, to break my heart,"

6968,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,

6973,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"Relentless, however often"
6974,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,I kiss it in drouth.

6981,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,And good to me.
6982,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,
6983,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,And his eyes could see

6993,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,And his eyes were deep like the sea
6994,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"With shadow, and he looked at me,"
6995,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"Till I sank in him like the sea,"
6996,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,Awfully.
6997,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,
6998,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"Oh, he was multiform—"

7015,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"Tell me it isn’t true,"
7016,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,That you’re only frightening me!
7017,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,
7018,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"You will not stir,"
7019,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"Nor hear me, not a sound."
7020,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,—Then it was you—
7021,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,And all this time you were
7022,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,Like this when I lived with you.
7023,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,
7024,A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND,"It is not true,"

7744,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7745,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,_Dedicated to S. T. F._
7746,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7747,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“How, how,” he said. “Friend Chang,” I said,"
7748,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,“San Francisco sleeps as the dead—
7749,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Ended license, lust and play:"
7750,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Why do you iron the night away?
7751,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Your big clock speaks with a deadly sound,"
7752,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With a tick and a wail till dawn comes round.
7753,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"While the monster shadows glower and creep,"
7754,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,What can be better for man than sleep?”
7755,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7756,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“I will tell you a secret,” Chang replied;"
7757,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“My breast with vision is satisfied,"
7758,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And I see green trees and fluttering wings,"
7759,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings.”
7760,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Then he lit five fire-crackers in a pan.
7761,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Pop, pop!” said the fire-crackers, “cra-cra-crack!”"
7762,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,He lit a joss-stick long and black.
7763,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Then the proud gray joss in the corner stirred;
7764,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"On his wrist appeared a gray small bird,"
7765,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And this was the song of the gray small bird:
7766,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7767,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Where is the princess, loved forever,"
7768,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Who made Chang first of the kings of men?”
7769,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7770,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And the joss in the corner stirred again;
7771,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And the carved dog, curled in his arms, awoke,"
7772,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Barked forth a smoke-cloud that whirled and broke.
7773,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"It piled in a maze round the ironing-place,"
7774,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And there on the snowy table wide
7775,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Stood a Chinese lady of high degree,"
7776,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"With a scornful, witching, tea-rose face ..."
7777,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Yet she put away all form and pride,"
7778,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And laid her glimmering veil aside
7779,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With a childlike smile for Chang and for me.
7780,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7781,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"The walls fell back, night was aflower,"
7782,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"The table gleamed in a moonlit bower,"
7783,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"While Chang, with a countenance carved of stone,"
7784,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Ironed and ironed, all alone."
7785,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And thus she sang to the busy man Chang:
7786,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,“Have you forgotten ...
7787,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Deep in the ages, long, long ago,"
7788,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"I was your sweetheart, there on the sand—"
7789,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Storm-worn beach of the Chinese land?
7790,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,We sold our grain in the peacock town
7791,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown—
7792,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown ...
7793,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7794,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,“When all the world was drinking blood
7795,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"From the skulls of men and bulls,"
7796,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And all the world had swords and clubs of stone,"
7797,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"We drank our tea in China beneath the sacred spice-trees,"
7798,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan.
7799,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And this gray bird, in Love’s first spring,"
7800,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing,"
7801,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Captured the world with his carolling.
7802,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Do you remember, ages after,"
7803,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,At last the world we were born to own?
7804,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,You were the heir of the yellow throne—
7805,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The world was the field of the Chinese man
7806,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And we were the pride of the sons of Han.
7807,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"We copied deep books, and we carved in jade,"
7808,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And wove white silks in the mulberry shade.”...
7809,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7810,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“I remember, I remember"
7811,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"That Spring came on forever,"
7812,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"That Spring came on forever,”"
7813,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Said the Chinese nightingale.
7814,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7815,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"My heart was filled with marvel and dream,"
7816,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Though I saw the western street-lamps gleam,"
7817,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Though dawn was bringing the western day,"
7818,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Though Chang was a laundryman ironing away ...
7819,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Mingled there with the streets and alleys,"
7820,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"The railroad-yard, and the clock-tower bright,"
7821,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Demon-clouds crossed ancient valleys;
7822,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Across wide lotus-ponds of light
7823,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,I marked a giant firefly’s flight.
7824,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7825,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And the lady, rosy-red,"
7826,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Opened her fan, closed her fan,"
7827,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Stretched her hand toward Chang, and said:"
7828,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Do you remember,"
7829,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Ages after,"
7830,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Our palace of heart-red stone?
7831,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Do you remember
7832,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The little doll-faced children
7833,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"With their lanterns full of moon-fire,"
7834,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,That came from all the empire
7835,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Honoring the throne?—
7836,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The loveliest fête and carnival
7837,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Our world had ever known?
7838,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The sages sat about us
7839,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"With their heads bowed in their beards,"
7840,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With proper meditation on the sight.
7841,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Confucius was not born;
7842,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,We lived in those great days
7843,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Confucius later said were lived aright ...
7844,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And this gray bird, on that day of spring,"
7845,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing,"
7846,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Captured the world with his carolling.
7847,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Late at night his tune was spent.
7848,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Peasants,"
7849,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Sages,"
7850,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Children,"
7851,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Homeward went,"
7852,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And then the bronze bird sang for you and me.
7853,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"We walked alone, our hearts were high and free."
7854,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"I had a silvery name, I had a silvery name,"
7855,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,I had a silvery name—do you remember
7856,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The name you cried beside the tumbling sea?”
7857,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7858,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Chang turned not to the lady slim—
7859,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"He bent to his work, ironing away;"
7860,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,But she was arch and knowing and glowing.
7861,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him.
7862,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7863,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,“Darling ... darling ... darling ... darling ...”
7864,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Said the Chinese nightingale.
7865,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7866,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,·       ·       ·       ·       ·
7867,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7868,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"The great gray joss on a rustic shelf,"
7869,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Rakish and shrewd, with his collar awry,"
7870,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Sang impolitely, as though by himself,"
7871,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale’s cry:
7872,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Back through a hundred, hundred years"
7873,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Hear the waves as they climb the piers,"
7874,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Hear the howl of the silver seas,"
7875,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Hear the thunder!
7876,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Hear the gongs of holy China
7877,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,How the waves and tunes combine
7878,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"In a rhythmic clashing wonder,"
7879,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Incantation old and fine:
7880,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"‘Dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons;"
7881,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Red fire-crackers, and green fire-crackers,"
7882,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons.’”"
7883,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7884,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Then the lady, rosy-red,"
7885,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Turned to her lover Chang and said:
7886,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,“Dare you forget that turquoise dawn
7887,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"When we stood in our mist-hung velvet lawn,"
7888,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And worked a spell this great joss taught
7889,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught?
7890,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,From the flag high over our palace-home
7891,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,He flew to our feet in rainbow-foam—
7892,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,A king of beauty and tempest and thunder
7893,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Panting to tear our sorrows asunder,"
7894,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,A dragon of fair adventure and wonder.
7895,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,We mounted the back of that royal slave
7896,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave.
7897,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"We swam down the shore to the dragon-mountains,"
7898,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains.
7899,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,To our secret ivory house we were borne.
7900,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,We looked down the wonderful wing-filled regions
7901,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions.
7902,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Right by my breast the nightingale sang;
7903,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist
7904,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,That we this hour regain—
7905,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Song-fire for the brain.
7906,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed,"
7907,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"When you cried for your heart’s new pain,"
7908,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"What was my name in the dragon-mist,"
7909,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,In the rings of rainbowed rain?”
7910,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7911,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Sorrow and love, glory and love,”"
7912,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Said the Chinese nightingale.
7913,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Sorrow and love, glory and love,”"
7914,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Said the Chinese nightingale.
7915,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7916,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And now the joss broke in with his song:
7917,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Dying ember, bird of Chang,"
7918,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Soul of Chang, do you remember?—"
7919,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Ere you returned to the shining harbor
7920,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,There were pirates by ten thousand
7921,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Descended on the town
7922,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"In vessels mountain-high and red and brown,"
7923,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies.
7924,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes.
7925,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest;
7926,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,I stood upon the sand;
7927,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With lifted hand I looked upon them
7928,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes,"
7929,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again.
7930,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Deep, deep below the bay, the sea-weed and the spray,"
7931,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Embalmed in amber every pirate lies,"
7932,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Embalmed in amber every pirate lies.”
7933,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7934,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Then this did the noble lady say:
7935,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"“Bird, do you dream of our home-coming day"
7936,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,When you flew like a courier on before
7937,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"From the dragon-peak to our palace-door,"
7938,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And we drove the steed in your singing path—
7939,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath;
7940,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And found our city all aglow,"
7941,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And knighted this joss that decked it so?
7942,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,There were golden fishes in the purple river
7943,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And silver fishes and rainbow fishes.
7944,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"There were golden junks in the laughing river,"
7945,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And silver junks and rainbow junks:
7946,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"There were golden lilies by the bay and river,"
7947,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And silver lilies and tiger-lilies,"
7948,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town
7949,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,By the black-lacquer gate
7950,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Where walked in state
7951,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The kind king Chang
7952,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And his sweetheart mate ...
7953,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With his flag-born dragon
7954,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And his crown of pearl ... and ... jade;
7955,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade,"
7956,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown,"
7957,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,And priests who bowed them down to your song—
7958,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"By the city called Han, the peacock town,"
7959,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"By the city called Han, the nightingale town,"
7960,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The nightingale town.”
7961,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7962,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Then sang the bird, so strangely gay,"
7963,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Fluttering, fluttering, ghostly and gray,"
7964,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"A vague, unravelling, answering tune,"
7965,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Like a long unwinding silk cocoon;
7966,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Sang as though for the soul of him
7967,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Who ironed away in that bower dim:
7968,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,
7969,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,“I have forgotten
7970,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Your dragons great,"
7971,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Merry and mad and friendly and bold.
7972,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Dim is your proud lost palace-gate.
7973,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,I vaguely know
7974,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"There were heroes of old,"
7975,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Troubles more than the heart could hold,"
7976,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,There were wolves in the woods
7977,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Yet lambs in the fold,"
7978,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Nests in the top of the almond tree ...
7979,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,The evergreen tree ... and the mulberry tree ...
7980,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Life and hurry and joy forgotten,"
7981,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Years on years I but half-remember ...
7982,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Man is a torch, then ashes soon,"
7983,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"May and June, then dead December,"
7984,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Dead December, then again June."
7985,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Who shall end my dream’s confusion?
7986,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Life is a loom, weaving illusion ..."
7987,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"I remember, I remember"
7988,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,There were ghostly veils and laces ...
7989,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"In the shadowy, bowery places ..."
7990,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,With lovers’ ardent faces
7991,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Bending to one another,"
7992,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Speaking each his part.
7993,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,They infinitely echo
7994,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,In the red cave of my heart.
7995,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"‘Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart!’"
7996,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,They said to one another.
7997,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"They spoke, I think, of perils past."
7998,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"They spoke, I think, of peace at last."
7999,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,One thing I remember:
8000,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Spring came on forever,"
8001,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,"Spring came on forever,”"
8002,THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE,Said the Chinese nightingale.

8013,PATTERNS,And all the daffodils
8014,PATTERNS,"Are blowing, and the bright blue squills."
8015,PATTERNS,I walk down the patterned garden paths
8016,PATTERNS,"In my stiff, brocaded gown."
8017,PATTERNS,
8018,PATTERNS,"With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,"
8019,PATTERNS,I too am a rare
8020,PATTERNS,Pattern. As I wander down
8021,PATTERNS,The garden paths.
8022,PATTERNS,
8023,PATTERNS,"My dress is richly figured,"
8024,PATTERNS,And the train
8025,PATTERNS,Makes a pink and silver stain
8026,PATTERNS,"On the gravel, and the thrift"
8027,PATTERNS,Of the borders.
8028,PATTERNS,"Just a plate of current fashion,"
8029,PATTERNS,"Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes."
8030,PATTERNS,"Not a softness anywhere about me,"
8031,PATTERNS,Only whale-bone and brocade.
8032,PATTERNS,And I sink on a seat in the shade
8033,PATTERNS,Of a lime tree. For my passion
8034,PATTERNS,Wars against the stiff brocade.
8035,PATTERNS,The daffodils and squills
8036,PATTERNS,Flutter in the breeze
8037,PATTERNS,As they please.
8038,PATTERNS,And I weep;
8039,PATTERNS,For the lime tree is in blossom
8040,PATTERNS,And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.
8041,PATTERNS,
8042,PATTERNS,And the plashing of waterdrops
8043,PATTERNS,In the marble fountain
8044,PATTERNS,Comes down the garden paths.
8045,PATTERNS,The dripping never stops.
8046,PATTERNS,Underneath my stiffened gown
8047,PATTERNS,"Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,"
8048,PATTERNS,A basin in the midst of hedges grown
8049,PATTERNS,"So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,"
8050,PATTERNS,"But she guesses he is near,"
8051,PATTERNS,And the sliding of the water
8052,PATTERNS,Seems the stroking of a dear
8053,PATTERNS,Hand upon her.
8054,PATTERNS,
8055,PATTERNS,What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!
8056,PATTERNS,I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.
8057,PATTERNS,All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.
8058,PATTERNS,
8059,PATTERNS,"I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,"
8060,PATTERNS,"And he would stumble after,"
8061,PATTERNS,Bewildered by my laughter.
8062,PATTERNS,I should see the sun flashing from his sword hilt and the buckles on his
8063,PATTERNS,shoes.
8064,PATTERNS,I would choose
8065,PATTERNS,"To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,"
8066,PATTERNS,"A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,"
8067,PATTERNS,"Till he caught me in the shade,"
8068,PATTERNS,"And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,"
8069,PATTERNS,"Aching, melting, unafraid."
8070,PATTERNS,"With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,"
8071,PATTERNS,"And the plopping of the waterdrops,"
8072,PATTERNS,All about us in the open afternoon—
8073,PATTERNS,I am very like to swoon
8074,PATTERNS,"With the weight of this brocade,"
8075,PATTERNS,For the sun shifts through the shade.
8076,PATTERNS,
8077,PATTERNS,Underneath the fallen blossom
8078,PATTERNS,"In my bosom,"
8079,PATTERNS,Is a letter I have hid.
8080,PATTERNS,It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.
8081,PATTERNS,"“Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell"
8082,PATTERNS,Died in action Thursday se’nnight.”
8083,PATTERNS,"As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,"
8084,PATTERNS,The letters squirmed like snakes.
8085,PATTERNS,"“Any answer, Madam?” said my footman."
8086,PATTERNS,"“No,” I told him."
8087,PATTERNS,“See that the messenger takes some refreshment.
8088,PATTERNS,"No, no answer.”"
8089,PATTERNS,
8090,PATTERNS,"And I walked into the garden,"
8091,PATTERNS,Up and down the patterned pat
8092,PATTERNS,"In my stiff, correct brocade."
8093,PATTERNS,"The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,"
8094,PATTERNS,Each one.
8095,PATTERNS,"I stood upright too,"
8096,PATTERNS,Held rigid to the pattern
8097,PATTERNS,By the stiffness of my gown.
8098,PATTERNS,"Up and down I walked,"
8099,PATTERNS,Up and down.
8100,PATTERNS,
8101,PATTERNS,In a month he would have been my husband.
8102,PATTERNS,"In a month, here, underneath this lime,"
8103,PATTERNS,We would have broke the pattern;
8104,PATTERNS,"He for me, and I for him,"
8105,PATTERNS,"He as Colonel, I as Lady,"
8106,PATTERNS,On this shady seat.
8107,PATTERNS,He had a whim
8108,PATTERNS,That sunlight carried blessing.
8109,PATTERNS,"And I answered, “It shall be as you have said.”"
8110,PATTERNS,Now he is dead.
8111,PATTERNS,
8112,PATTERNS,In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
8113,PATTERNS,Up and down
8114,PATTERNS,The patterned garden paths
8115,PATTERNS,"In my stiff, brocaded gown."
8116,PATTERNS,The squills and daffodils
8117,PATTERNS,"Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow."
8118,PATTERNS,I shall go
8119,PATTERNS,"Up and down,"
8120,PATTERNS,In my gown.
8121,PATTERNS,"Gorgeously arrayed,"
8122,PATTERNS,Boned and stayed.
8123,PATTERNS,And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace
8124,PATTERNS,"By each button, hook, and lace."
8125,PATTERNS,
8126,PATTERNS,"For the man who should loose me is dead,"
8127,PATTERNS,"Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,"
8128,PATTERNS,In a pattern called a war.

8140,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"Red! Red! Coarse notes of red,"

8150,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"I only know that they are red and open,"
8151,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,And that the sun above the arbor shakes with heat.
8152,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"My quill is newly mended,"
8153,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,And makes fine-drawn lines with its point.
8154,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"Down the long white paper it makes little lines,"
8155,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"Just lines,—up—down—criss-cross."
8156,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,My heart is strained out at the pin-point of my quill;
8157,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen.
8158,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"My hand marches to a squeaky tune,"
8159,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes.
8160,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"My pen and the trumpet-flowers,"
8161,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,And Washington’s armies away over the smoke-tree to the southwest.
8162,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"“Yankee Doodle,” my darling! It is you against the British,"
8163,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George.

8171,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"The red city, and the blue, bright water,"
8172,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,And puffs of smoke which you made.

8174,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"Round by Cambridge, or over the Neck,"
8175,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,But the smoke was white—white!
8176,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,To-day the trumpet-flowers are red—red—
8177,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,And I cannot see you fighting;
8178,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,"But old Mr. Dimond has fled to Canada,"
8179,I—THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR,And Myra sings “Yankee Doodle” at her milking.

9221,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Perched on the bluff, overlooking miles of valley,"
9222,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"My days of labor closed, sitting out life’s decline,"
9223,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Day by day did I look in my memory,"
9224,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"As one who gazes in an enchantress’ crystal globe,"
9225,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"And I saw the figures of the past,"
9226,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"As if in a pageant glassed by a shining dream,"
9227,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Move through the incredible sphere of time.
9228,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,And I saw a man arise from the soil like a fabled giant
9229,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"And throw himself over a deathless destiny,"
9230,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Master of great armies, head of the republic,"
9231,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Bringing together into a dithyramb of recreative song
9232,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,The epic hopes of a people;
9233,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"At the same time Vulcan of sovereign fires,"
9234,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Where imperishable shields and swords were beaten out
9235,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,From spirits tempered in heaven.
9236,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Look in the crystal! See how he hastens on
9237,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,To the place where his path comes up to the path
9238,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Of a child of Plutarch and Shakespeare.
9239,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"O Lincoln, actor indeed, playing well your part,"
9240,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"And Booth, who strode in a mimic play within the play,"
9241,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Often and often I saw you,"
9242,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,As the cawing crows winged their way to the wood
9243,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Over my house-top at solemn sunsets,"
9244,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"There by my window,"
9245,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Alone.

9250,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,They brought me ambrotypes
9251,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Of the old pioneers to enlarge.
9252,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,And sometimes one sat for me—
9253,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Some one who was in being
9254,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,When giant hands from the womb of the world
9255,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Tore the republic.
9256,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,What was it in their eyes?—
9257,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,For I could never fathom
9258,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"That mystical pathos of drooped eyelids,"
9259,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,And the serene sorrow of their eyes.
9260,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"It was like a pool of water,"
9261,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Amid oak trees at the edge of a forest,"
9262,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Where the leaves fall,"
9263,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,As you hear the crow of a cock
9264,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"From a far-off farm house, seen near the hills"
9265,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Where the third generation lives, and the strong men"
9266,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,And the strong women are gone and forgotten.
9267,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,And these grand-children and great grand-children
9268,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Of the pioneers!—
9269,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"Truly did my camera record their faces, too,"
9270,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"With so much of the old strength gone,"
9271,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"And the old faith gone,"
9272,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"And the old mastery of life gone,"
9273,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,"And the old courage gone,"
9274,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Which labors and loves and suffers and sings
9275,WILLIAM H. HERNDON,Under the sun!

9305,AARON HATFIELD,Is the memory-picture you keep of me
9306,AARON HATFIELD,Standing before the pioneer men and women
9307,AARON HATFIELD,There at Concord Church on Communion day.
9308,AARON HATFIELD,Speaking in broken voice of the peasant youth
9309,AARON HATFIELD,Of Galilee who went to the city
9310,AARON HATFIELD,And was killed by bankers and lawyers;
9311,AARON HATFIELD,My voice mingling with the June wind
9312,AARON HATFIELD,That blew over wheat fields from Atterbury;
9313,AARON HATFIELD,While the white stones in the burying ground
9314,AARON HATFIELD,Around the Church shimmered in the summer sun.
9315,AARON HATFIELD,"And there, though my own memories"
9316,AARON HATFIELD,"Were too great to bear, were you, O pioneers,"
9317,AARON HATFIELD,With bowed heads breathing forth your sorrow
9318,AARON HATFIELD,For the sons killed in battle and the daughters
9319,AARON HATFIELD,"And little children who vanished in life’s morning,"
9320,AARON HATFIELD,Or at the intolerable hour of noon.
9321,AARON HATFIELD,"But in those moments of tragic silence,"
9322,AARON HATFIELD,"When the wine and bread were passed,"
9323,AARON HATFIELD,Came the reconciliation for us—
9324,AARON HATFIELD,"Us the ploughmen and the hewers of wood,"
9325,AARON HATFIELD,"Us the peasants, brothers of the peasant of Galilee—"
9326,AARON HATFIELD,To us came the Comforter

9337,WEBSTER FORD,"And from thence, as the wearisome years rolled on, long after"
9338,WEBSTER FORD,"Poor Mickey fell down in the water tower to his death,"
9339,WEBSTER FORD,"Down, down, through bellowing darkness, I carried"
9340,WEBSTER FORD,The vision which perished with him like a rocket which falls
9341,WEBSTER FORD,"And quenches its light in earth, and hid it for fear"
9342,WEBSTER FORD,"Of the son of the banker, calling on Plutus to save me?"
9343,WEBSTER FORD,"Avenged were you for the shame of a fearful heart,"
9344,WEBSTER FORD,Who left me alone till I saw you again in an hour
9345,WEBSTER FORD,When I seemed to be turned to a tree with trunk and branches

9347,WEBSTER FORD,"In laurel leaves, in hosts of lambent laurel,"
9348,WEBSTER FORD,"Quivering, fluttering, shrinking, fighting the numbness"

9358,WEBSTER FORD,To flourish until you fall. O leaves of me
9359,WEBSTER FORD,"Too sere for coronal wreaths, and fit alone"

9380,SILENCE,"Sitting in front of the grocery store,"
9381,SILENCE,“How did you lose your leg?”
9382,SILENCE,"And the old soldier is struck with silence,"
9383,SILENCE,Or his mind flies away
9384,SILENCE,Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg.
9385,SILENCE,It comes back jocosely

9405,SILENCE,Into a realm of higher life.
9406,SILENCE,There is the silence of defeat.
9407,SILENCE,There is the silence of those unjustly punished;
9408,SILENCE,And the silence of the dying whose hand
9409,SILENCE,Suddenly grips yours.
9410,SILENCE,"There is the silence between father and son,"

9422,SILENCE,And the silence of Jeanne d’Arc
9423,SILENCE,"Saying amid the flames, “Blessed Jesus”—"
9424,SILENCE,"Revealing in two words all sorrows, all hope."
9425,SILENCE,"And there is the silence of age,"
9426,SILENCE,Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it
9427,SILENCE,In words intelligible to those who have not lived
9428,SILENCE,The great range of life.
9429,SILENCE,
9430,SILENCE,And there is the silence of the dead.
9431,SILENCE,If we who are in life cannot speak

9433,SILENCE,Why do you marvel that the dead
9434,SILENCE,Do not tell you of death?
9435,SILENCE,Their silence shall be interpreted
9436,SILENCE,As we approach them.

9675,GREAT CITY,"When I returned at sunset,"
9676,GREAT CITY,The serving-maid was singing softly
9677,GREAT CITY,"Under the dark stairs, and in the house"
9678,GREAT CITY,Twilight had entered like a moon-ray.
9679,GREAT CITY,Time was so dead I could not understand
9680,GREAT CITY,"The meaning of midday or of midnight,"
9681,GREAT CITY,"But like falling waters, falling, hissing, falling,"
9682,GREAT CITY,Silence seemed an everlasting sound.
9683,GREAT CITY,
9684,GREAT CITY,"I sat in my room,"
9685,GREAT CITY,"And watched sunset,"
9686,GREAT CITY,And saw starlight.
9687,GREAT CITY,"I heard the tramp of homing men,"
9688,GREAT CITY,And the last call of the last child;
9689,GREAT CITY,"Then a lone bird twittered,"
9690,GREAT CITY,"And suddenly, beyond the housetops,"
9691,GREAT CITY,"I imagined dew in the country,"
9692,GREAT CITY,"In the hay, on the buttercups;"
9693,GREAT CITY,"The rising moon,"

9700,GREAT CITY,
9701,GREAT CITY,When all the lamps were lighted in the town
9702,GREAT CITY,"I passed into the street ways and I watched,"
9703,GREAT CITY,"Wakeful, almost happy,"
9704,GREAT CITY,And half the night I wandered in the street.

9746,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9747,THE STRANGE COMPANION,_A Fragment_
9748,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9749,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"That strange companion came on shuffling feet,"
9750,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Passed me, then turned, and touched my arm."
9751,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9752,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"He said (and he was melancholy,"
9753,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"And both of us looked fretfully,"
9754,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"And slowly we advanced together),"
9755,THE STRANGE COMPANION,He said: “I bring you your inheritance.”
9756,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9757,THE STRANGE COMPANION,I watched his eyes; they were dim.
9758,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"I doubted him, watched him, doubted him ..."
9759,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"But, in a ceremonious way,"
9760,THE STRANGE COMPANION,He said: “You are too grey:
9761,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Come, you must be merry for a day.”"
9762,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9763,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"And I, because my heart was dumb,"
9764,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Because the life in me was numb,"
9765,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Cried: “I will come. I _will_ come.”
9766,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9767,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"So, without another word,"
9768,THE STRANGE COMPANION,We two jaunted on the street.
9769,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"I had heard, often heard,"
9770,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"The shuffling of those feet of his,"
9771,THE STRANGE COMPANION,The shuffle of his feet.
9772,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9773,THE STRANGE COMPANION,And he muttered in my ear
9774,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Such a wheezy jest
9775,THE STRANGE COMPANION,As a man may often hear—
9776,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Not the worst, not the best"
9777,THE STRANGE COMPANION,That a man may hear.
9778,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9779,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Then he murmured in my face
9780,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Something that was true.
9781,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"He said: “I have known this long, long while,"
9782,THE STRANGE COMPANION,All there is to know of you.”
9783,THE STRANGE COMPANION,And the light of the lamp cut a strange smile
9784,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"On his face, and we muttered along the street,"
9785,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Good enough friends, on the usual beat."
9786,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9787,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"We lived together long, long."
9788,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"We were always alone, he and I."
9789,THE STRANGE COMPANION,We never smiled with each other;
9790,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"We were like brother and brother,"
9791,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Dimly accustomed.
9792,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Can a man know
9793,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Why he must live, or where he should go?"
9794,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9795,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"He brought me that joke or two,"
9796,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"And we roared with laughter, for want of a smile,"
9797,THE STRANGE COMPANION,As every man in the world might do.
9798,THE STRANGE COMPANION,He who lies all night in bed
9799,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Is a fool, and midnight will crush his head."
9800,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9801,THE STRANGE COMPANION,When he threw a glass of wine in my face
9802,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"One night, I hit him, and we parted;"
9803,THE STRANGE COMPANION,But in a short space
9804,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"We came back to each other melancholy-hearted,"
9805,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"Told our pain,"
9806,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Swore we would not part again.
9807,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9808,THE STRANGE COMPANION,One night we turned a table over
9809,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"The body of some slain fool to cover,"
9810,THE STRANGE COMPANION,And all the company clapped their hands;
9811,THE STRANGE COMPANION,"So we spat in their faces,"
9812,THE STRANGE COMPANION,And travelled away to other lands.
9813,THE STRANGE COMPANION,
9814,THE STRANGE COMPANION,I wish for every man he find
9815,THE STRANGE COMPANION,A strange companion so
9816,THE STRANGE COMPANION,Completely to his mind
9817,THE STRANGE COMPANION,With whom he everywhere may go.

9834,THE HOTEL,lifted high in round green tubs.
9835,THE HOTEL,"The electric lights in twos and threes and hundreds, made into festoons"
9836,THE HOTEL,"and spirals and arabesques, a maze and magic of bright persistent"

9838,THE HOTEL,"The people sitting in corners by twos and threes, and cooing together"
9839,THE HOTEL,under the glare.
9840,THE HOTEL,"The long rows of silent people in chairs, watching with eyes that see"
9841,THE HOTEL,not while the patient band tangles the air with music.
9842,THE HOTEL,"The bell-boys marching in with cards, and shouting names over and over"
9843,THE HOTEL,into ears that do not heed.
9844,THE HOTEL,"The stout and gorgeous dowagers in lacy white and lilac, bedizened with"

9851,THE HOTEL,"The telephone girls forever listening to far voices, with the silver"

9854,THE HOTEL,The telegraph tickers sounding their perpetual chit—chit-chit from the
9855,THE HOTEL,uttermost ends of the earth.
9856,THE HOTEL,"The waiters, in black swallow-tails and white aprons, passing here and"
9857,THE HOTEL,there with trays of bottles and glasses.
9858,THE HOTEL,"The quiet and sumptuous bar-room, with purplish men softly drinking in"
9859,THE HOTEL,"little alcoves, while the barkeeper, mixing bright liquors, is"
9860,THE HOTEL,rapidly plying his bottles.
9861,THE HOTEL,"The great bedecked and gilded café, with its glitter of a thousand"

9863,THE HOTEL,"whereto bright forks, held by pampered hands, flicker daintily back"
9864,THE HOTEL,and forth.
9865,THE HOTEL,"The white-tiled, immaculate kitchen, with many little round blue fires,"
9866,THE HOTEL,where white-clad cooks are making spiced and flavored dishes.
9867,THE HOTEL,"The cool cellars filled with meats and fruits, or layered with sealed"
9868,THE HOTEL,and bottled wines mellowing softly in the darkness.

9871,THE HOTEL,The many-windowed stories of little homes and shelters and
9872,THE HOTEL,"sleeping-places, reaching up into the night like some miraculous,"
9873,THE HOTEL,high-piled honey-comb of wax-white cells.
9874,THE HOTEL,"The clothes inside of the cells—the stuffs, the silks, the laces; the"
9875,THE HOTEL,elaborate delicate disguises that wait in trunks and drawers and
9876,THE HOTEL,"closets, or bedrape and conceal human flesh."
9877,THE HOTEL,"The people inside of the clothes, the bodies white and young, bodies fat"

9885,THE HOTEL,from the shining truth.

9893,THE TURBINE,
9894,THE TURBINE,_To W. S. M._
9895,THE TURBINE,
9896,THE TURBINE,Look at her—there she sits upon her throne
9897,THE TURBINE,As ladylike and quiet as a nun!
9898,THE TURBINE,But if you cross her—whew! her thunderbolts
9899,THE TURBINE,"Will shake the earth! She’s proud as any queen,"
9900,THE TURBINE,"The beauty—knows her royal business too,"
9901,THE TURBINE,"To light the world, and does it night by night"
9902,THE TURBINE,"When her gay lord, the sun, gives up his job."
9903,THE TURBINE,I am her slave; I wake and watch and run
9904,THE TURBINE,From dark till dawn beside her. All the while
9905,THE TURBINE,"She hums there softly, purring with delight"
9906,THE TURBINE,Because men bring the riches of the earth
9907,THE TURBINE,To feed her hungry fires. I do her will
9908,THE TURBINE,"And dare not disobey, for her right hand"
9909,THE TURBINE,"Is power, her left is terror, and her anger"
9910,THE TURBINE,Is havoc. Look—if I but lay a wire
9911,THE TURBINE,Across the terminals of yonder switch
9912,THE TURBINE,"She’ll burst her windings, rip her casings off,"
9913,THE TURBINE,"And shriek till envious Hell shoots up its flames,"
9914,THE TURBINE,"Shattering her very throne. And all her people,"
9915,THE TURBINE,"The laboring, trampling, dreaming crowds out there—"
9916,THE TURBINE,Fools and the wise who look to her for light—
9917,THE TURBINE,Will walk in darkness through the liquid night
9918,THE TURBINE,Submerged.
9919,THE TURBINE,
9920,THE TURBINE,Sometimes I wonder why she stoops
9921,THE TURBINE,"To be my friend—oh yes, who talks to me"
9922,THE TURBINE,And sings away my loneliness; my friend
9923,THE TURBINE,Though I am trivial and she sublime.
9924,THE TURBINE,"Hard-hearted?—No, tender and pitiful,"
9925,THE TURBINE,As all the great are. Every arrogant grief
9926,THE TURBINE,"She comforts quietly, and all my joys"
9927,THE TURBINE,Dance to her measures through the tolerant night.
9928,THE TURBINE,"She talks to me, tells me her troubles too,"
9929,THE TURBINE,Just as I tell her mine. Perhaps she feels
9930,THE TURBINE,An ache deep down—that agonizing stab
9931,THE TURBINE,Of grit grating her bearings; then her voice
9932,THE TURBINE,"Changes its tune, it wails and calls to me"
9933,THE TURBINE,"To soothe her anguish, and I run, her slave,"
9934,THE TURBINE,Probe like a surgeon and relieve the pain.
9935,THE TURBINE,
9936,THE TURBINE,"We have our jokes too, little mockeries"
9937,THE TURBINE,That no one else in all the swarming world
9938,THE TURBINE,Would see the point of. She will laugh at me
9939,THE TURBINE,To show her power: maybe her carbon packings
9940,THE TURBINE,"Leak steam, and I run madly back and forth"
9941,THE TURBINE,To keep the infernal fiends from breaking loose:
9942,THE TURBINE,Suddenly she will throttle them herself
9943,THE TURBINE,"And chuckle softly, far above me there,"
9944,THE TURBINE,At my alarms.
9945,THE TURBINE,
9946,THE TURBINE,But there are moments—hush!—
9947,THE TURBINE,"When my turn comes; her slave can be her master,"
9948,THE TURBINE,"Conquering her he serves. For she’s a woman,"
9949,THE TURBINE,"Gets bored there on her throne, tired of herself,"
9950,THE TURBINE,Tingles with power that turns to wantonness.
9951,THE TURBINE,"Suddenly something’s wrong—she laughs at me,"
9952,THE TURBINE,Bedevils the frail wires with some mad caress
9953,THE TURBINE,"That thrills blind space, calls down ten thousand lightnings"
9954,THE TURBINE,To ruin her pomp and set her spirit free.
9955,THE TURBINE,"Then with this puny hand, swift as her threat,"
9956,THE TURBINE,"Must I beat back the chaos, hold in leash"
9957,THE TURBINE,"Destructive furies, rescue her—even her—"
9958,THE TURBINE,"From the fierce rashness of her truant mood,"
9959,THE TURBINE,"And make me lord of far and near a moment,"
9960,THE TURBINE,Startling the mystery. Last night I did it—
9961,THE TURBINE,Alone here with my hand upon her heart
9962,THE TURBINE,I faced the mounting fiends and whipped them down;
9963,THE TURBINE,And never a wink from the long file of lamps
9964,THE TURBINE,Betrayed her to the world.
9965,THE TURBINE,
9966,THE TURBINE,"So there she sits,"
9967,THE TURBINE,"Mounted on all the ages, at the peak"
9968,THE TURBINE,"Of time. The first man dreamed of light, and dug"
9969,THE TURBINE,"The sodden ignorance away, and cursed"
9970,THE TURBINE,The darkness; young primeval races dragged
9971,THE TURBINE,"Foundation stones, and piled into the void"
9972,THE TURBINE,Rage and desire; the Greek mounted and sang
9973,THE TURBINE,Promethean songs and lit a signal fire:
9974,THE TURBINE,The Roman bent his iron will to forge
9975,THE TURBINE,Deep furnaces; slow epochs riveted
9976,THE TURBINE,With hope the secret chambers: till at last
9977,THE TURBINE,"We, you and I, this living age of ours,"
9978,THE TURBINE,"A new-winged Mercury, out of the skies"
9979,THE TURBINE,"Filch the wild spirit of light, and chain him there"
9980,THE TURBINE,To do her will forever.
9981,THE TURBINE,
9982,THE TURBINE,"Look, my friend,"
9983,THE TURBINE,Here is a sign! What is this crystal sphere—
9984,THE TURBINE,"This little bulb of glass I lightly lift,"
9985,THE TURBINE,This iridescent bubble a child might blow
9986,THE TURBINE,Out of its brazen pipe to hold the sun—
9987,THE TURBINE,What strange toy is it? In my hand it lies
9988,THE TURBINE,"Cold and inert, its puny artery—"
9989,THE TURBINE,That curling cobweb film—ashen and dead.
9990,THE TURBINE,But now—a twist or two—let it but touch
9991,THE TURBINE,"The hem, far trailing, of my lady’s robe,"
9992,THE TURBINE,"And look, the burning life-blood of the stars"
9993,THE TURBINE,"Leaps to its heart, and glows against the dark,"
9994,THE TURBINE,Kindling the world.
9995,THE TURBINE,
9996,THE TURBINE,"Even so I touch her garment,"
9997,THE TURBINE,Her servant through the quiet night; and thus
9998,THE TURBINE,I lay my hand upon the Pleiades
9999,THE TURBINE,And feel their throb of fire. Grandly she gives
10000,THE TURBINE,"To me unworthy; woman inscrutable,"
10001,THE TURBINE,"Scatters her splendors through my darkness, leads me"
10002,THE TURBINE,Far out into the workshop of the worlds.
10003,THE TURBINE,There I can feel those infinite energies
10004,THE TURBINE,"Our little earth just gnaws at through the ether,"
10005,THE TURBINE,"And see the light our sunshine hides. Out there,"
10006,THE TURBINE,"Close to the heart of life, I am at peace."

11313,LA FRAISNE,_Scene: The Ash Wood of Malvern_
11314,LA FRAISNE,
11315,LA FRAISNE,"For I was a gaunt, grave councillor,"
11316,LA FRAISNE,"Being in all things wise, and very old;"
11317,LA FRAISNE,But I have put aside this folly and the cold
11318,LA FRAISNE,That old age weareth for a cloak.
11319,LA FRAISNE,
11320,LA FRAISNE,I was quite strong—at least they said so—
11321,LA FRAISNE,The young men at the sword-play;
11322,LA FRAISNE,"But I have put aside this folly, being gay"
11323,LA FRAISNE,In another fashion that more suiteth me.
11324,LA FRAISNE,
11325,LA FRAISNE,"I have curled mid the boles of the ash wood,"
11326,LA FRAISNE,I have hidden my face where the oak
11327,LA FRAISNE,"Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke"
11328,LA FRAISNE,Of the old ways of men have I cast aside.
11329,LA FRAISNE,
11330,LA FRAISNE,By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha
11331,LA FRAISNE,Have I found me a bride
11332,LA FRAISNE,That was a dog-wood tree some syne.
11333,LA FRAISNE,She hath called me from mine old ways;
11334,LA FRAISNE,"She hath hushed my rancor of council,"
11335,LA FRAISNE,Bidding me praise
11336,LA FRAISNE,
11337,LA FRAISNE,Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves.
11338,LA FRAISNE,
11339,LA FRAISNE,"She hath drawn me from mine old ways,"
11340,LA FRAISNE,Till men say that I am mad;
11341,LA FRAISNE,"But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,"
11342,LA FRAISNE,For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly.
11343,LA FRAISNE,And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief.
11344,LA FRAISNE,I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf
11345,LA FRAISNE,And left them under a stone;
11346,LA FRAISNE,And now men call me mad because I have thrown
11347,LA FRAISNE,"All folly from me, putting it aside"
11348,LA FRAISNE,"To leave the old barren ways of men,"
11349,LA FRAISNE,Because my bride
11350,LA FRAISNE,Is a pool of the wood; and
11351,LA FRAISNE,Though all men say that I am mad
11352,LA FRAISNE,It is only that I am glad—
11353,LA FRAISNE,"Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love"
11354,LA FRAISNE,That is sweeter than the love of women
11355,LA FRAISNE,That plague and burn and drive one away.
11356,LA FRAISNE,
11357,LA FRAISNE,"Aie-e! ’Tis true that I am gay,"
11358,LA FRAISNE,"Quite gay, for I have her alone here"
11359,LA FRAISNE,And no man troubleth us.
11360,LA FRAISNE,
11361,LA FRAISNE,Once when I was among the young men ...
11362,LA FRAISNE,"And they said I was quite strong, among the young men ..."
11363,LA FRAISNE,Once there was a woman ...
11364,LA FRAISNE,... but I forget ... she was ...
11365,LA FRAISNE,... I hope she will not come again.
11366,LA FRAISNE,
11367,LA FRAISNE,... I do not remember ...
11368,LA FRAISNE,"I think she hurt me once, but ..."
11369,LA FRAISNE,That was very long ago.
11370,LA FRAISNE,
11371,LA FRAISNE,I do not like to remember things any more.
11372,LA FRAISNE,
11373,LA FRAISNE,I like one little band of winds that blow
11374,LA FRAISNE,In the ash trees here:
11375,LA FRAISNE,"For we are quite alone,"
11376,LA FRAISNE,Here mid the ash trees.

11422,EXILE’S LETTER,
11423,EXILE’S LETTER,"So-Kin of Rakuho, ancient friend, I now remember"
11424,EXILE’S LETTER,"That you built me a special tavern,"
11425,EXILE’S LETTER,By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.
11426,EXILE’S LETTER,With yellow gold and white jewels
11427,EXILE’S LETTER,"we paid for the songs and laughter,"
11428,EXILE’S LETTER,"And we were drunk for month after month,"
11429,EXILE’S LETTER,forgetting the kings and princes.
11430,EXILE’S LETTER,"Intelligent men came drifting in, from the sea"
11431,EXILE’S LETTER,"and from the west border,"
11432,EXILE’S LETTER,"And with them, and with you especially,"

11436,EXILE’S LETTER,If only they could be of that fellowship.
11437,EXILE’S LETTER,And we all spoke out our hearts and minds ...
11438,EXILE’S LETTER,and without regret.
11439,EXILE’S LETTER,"And then I was sent off to South Wei,"
11440,EXILE’S LETTER,"smothered in laurel groves,"
11441,EXILE’S LETTER,"And you to the north of Raku-hoku,"
11442,EXILE’S LETTER,Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories between us.

11446,EXILE’S LETTER,Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers ...
11447,EXILE’S LETTER,"that was the first valley,"
11448,EXILE’S LETTER,And on into ten thousand valleys

11450,EXILE’S LETTER,"With silver harness and reins of gold,"
11451,EXILE’S LETTER,"prostrating themselves on the ground,"

11454,EXILE’S LETTER,Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.
11455,EXILE’S LETTER,In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us

11461,EXILE’S LETTER,"And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap,"
11462,EXILE’S LETTER,And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens.
11463,EXILE’S LETTER,
11464,EXILE’S LETTER,
11465,EXILE’S LETTER,And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars or rain.
11466,EXILE’S LETTER,"I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,"
11467,EXILE’S LETTER,You back to your river-bridge.
11468,EXILE’S LETTER,"And your father, who was brave as a leopard,"
11469,EXILE’S LETTER,Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble.
11470,EXILE’S LETTER,"And one May he had you send for me, despite the long distance;"

11473,EXILE’S LETTER,Over roads twisted like sheep’s guts.
11474,EXILE’S LETTER,"And I was still going, late in the year,"

11476,EXILE’S LETTER,And thinking how little you cared for the cost ...
11477,EXILE’S LETTER,and you caring enough to pay it.
11478,EXILE’S LETTER,Then what a reception!
11479,EXILE’S LETTER,"Red jade cups, food well set, on a blue jewelled table;"
11480,EXILE’S LETTER,"And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning;"
11481,EXILE’S LETTER,"And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,"
11482,EXILE’S LETTER,"To the dynastic temple, with the water about it clear as blue jade,"
11483,EXILE’S LETTER,"With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,"
11484,EXILE’S LETTER,"With ripples like dragon-scales going grass-green on the water,"
11485,EXILE’S LETTER,"Pleasure lasting, with courtezans going and coming without hindrance,"
11486,EXILE’S LETTER,"With the willow-flakes falling like snow,"
11487,EXILE’S LETTER,"And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,"
11488,EXILE’S LETTER,And the waters a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows—
11489,EXILE’S LETTER,"Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,"
11490,EXILE’S LETTER,"Gracefully painted—and the girls singing back at each other,"
11491,EXILE’S LETTER,"Dancing in transparent brocade,"
11492,EXILE’S LETTER,"And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,"
11493,EXILE’S LETTER,Tossing it up under the clouds.
11494,EXILE’S LETTER,
11495,EXILE’S LETTER,
11496,EXILE’S LETTER,"And all this comes to an end,"
11497,EXILE’S LETTER,And is not again to be met with.
11498,EXILE’S LETTER,"I went up to the court for examination,"
11499,EXILE’S LETTER,"Tried Layu’s luck, offered the Choyu song,"
11500,EXILE’S LETTER,"And got no promotion,"
11501,EXILE’S LETTER,And went back to the East Mountains white-headed.
11502,EXILE’S LETTER,
11503,EXILE’S LETTER,"And once again we met, later, at the South Bridge head."
11504,EXILE’S LETTER,And then the crowd broke up—you went north to San palace.
11505,EXILE’S LETTER,And if you ask how I regret that parting?
11506,EXILE’S LETTER,"It is like the flowers falling at spring’s end,"
11507,EXILE’S LETTER,"confused, whirled in a tangle."
11508,EXILE’S LETTER,What is the use of talking! And there is no end of talking—

11511,EXILE’S LETTER,"I call in the boy,"

11553,SANGAR,"Smiled the boy then in faint scorn,"
11554,SANGAR,Hard with the battle-thrill;
11555,SANGAR,"“Arm thee, loud calls the war-horn"

11557,SANGAR,
11558,SANGAR,"He has bowed to the voice stentorian,"
11559,SANGAR,Sick with thought of the grave—
11560,SANGAR,He has called for his battered morion
11561,SANGAR,And his scarred glaive.
11562,SANGAR,On the boy’s helm a glove
11563,SANGAR,Of the Duke’s daughter—
11564,SANGAR,In his eyes splendor of love

11571,SANGAR,"And ever amid the clangor,"
11572,SANGAR,"Butchering Hun and Hun,"

11580,SANGAR,Yet though what had been mead
11581,SANGAR,"Is now a bloody lake,"
11582,SANGAR,"Still drink swords where men bleed,"
11583,SANGAR,Nor slake.
11584,SANGAR,

11586,SANGAR,The hell ’twixt front and front—
11587,SANGAR,"Sangar, bloody and torn of dress"

11589,SANGAR,"“Hold!” cries, “Peace! God’s peace!"

11605,SANGAR,"Weaponless, smiling he stands—"
11606,SANGAR,(Coward or brave?)
11607,SANGAR,"“Traitor!” howls one rank, “Think ye"

11612,SANGAR,"Then sprang his son to his side,"
11613,SANGAR,"His lips with slaver were wet,"

11624,SANGAR,Up the two-handed sword.
11625,SANGAR,He smote—fell Sangar—and then
11626,SANGAR,"Screaming, red, the boy ran"
11627,SANGAR,"Straight at the foe, and again"

11654,DAGONET’S CANZONET,Watching the sky that knew
11655,DAGONET’S CANZONET,Itself transmuted there

11662,DAGONET’S CANZONET,But my soul learnt sorrow there
11663,DAGONET’S CANZONET,"In the secrets of her mouth,"

11685,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Yet you would not stay.
11686,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Cruel, and careless,"

11688,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Pain you cannot bear;

11690,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Lay matted, every tress;"
11691,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"When those looks of hers,"
11692,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Were no longer hers,"

11702,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,In their copartnery:
11703,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Care, ill fate, ill health,"
11704,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Came we know not how
11705,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,And broke our commonwealth.
11706,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Neither has you now.

11708,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Some wait you on the road,"
11709,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Some in an open door
11710,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Look for the face you showed
11711,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,Once there—no more.
11712,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,You never wear the dress
11713,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,You danced in yesterday;
11714,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Yet, seeming gone, you stay,"
11715,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,And come at no man’s call:
11716,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Yet, laid for burial,"
11717,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,You lift up from the dead
11718,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Your laughing, spangled head."

11725,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Now that I know you well,"

11728,A SONG OF HAPPINESS,"Nor conjure you by night,"

11757,THE MASTER,THE MASTER
11758,THE MASTER,
11759,THE MASTER,_Lincoln as he appeared to one soon after the Civil War_
11760,THE MASTER,
11761,THE MASTER,A flying word from here and there
11762,THE MASTER,"Had sown the name at which we sneered,"
11763,THE MASTER,"But soon the name was everywhere,"
11764,THE MASTER,To be reviled and then revered:
11765,THE MASTER,"A presence to be loved and feared,"
11766,THE MASTER,"We cannot hide it, or deny"
11767,THE MASTER,"That we, the gentlemen who jeered,"
11768,THE MASTER,May be forgotten by and by.
11769,THE MASTER,
11770,THE MASTER,He came when days were perilous
11771,THE MASTER,"And hearts of men were sore beguiled,"
11772,THE MASTER,"And having made his note of us,"
11773,THE MASTER,He pondered and was reconciled.
11774,THE MASTER,Was ever master yet so mild
11775,THE MASTER,"As he, and so untamable?"
11776,THE MASTER,"We doubted, even when he smiled,"
11777,THE MASTER,Not knowing what he knew so well.
11778,THE MASTER,
11779,THE MASTER,He knew that undeceiving fate
11780,THE MASTER,Would shame us whom he served unsought;
11781,THE MASTER,He knew that he must wince and wait—
11782,THE MASTER,The jest of those for whom he fought;
11783,THE MASTER,He knew devoutly what he thought
11784,THE MASTER,Of us and of our ridicule;
11785,THE MASTER,He knew that we must all be taught
11786,THE MASTER,Like little children in a school.
11787,THE MASTER,
11788,THE MASTER,We gave a glamour to the task
11789,THE MASTER,That he encountered and saw through;
11790,THE MASTER,"But little of us did he ask,"
11791,THE MASTER,And little did we ever do.
11792,THE MASTER,And what appears if we review
11793,THE MASTER,The season when we railed and chaffed?—
11794,THE MASTER,It is the face of one who knew
11795,THE MASTER,That we were learning while we laughed.
11796,THE MASTER,
11797,THE MASTER,The face that in our vision feels
11798,THE MASTER,"Again the venom that we flung,"
11799,THE MASTER,"Transfigured, to the world reveals"
11800,THE MASTER,The vigilance to which we clung.
11801,THE MASTER,"Shrewd, hallowed, harassed, and among"
11802,THE MASTER,The mysteries that are untold—
11803,THE MASTER,"The face we see was never young,"
11804,THE MASTER,Nor could it ever have been old.
11805,THE MASTER,
11806,THE MASTER,"For he, to whom we had applied"
11807,THE MASTER,"Our shopman’s test of age and worth,"
11808,THE MASTER,"Was elemental when he died,"
11809,THE MASTER,As he was ancient at his birth:
11810,THE MASTER,"The saddest among kings of earth,"
11811,THE MASTER,"Bowed with a galling crown, this man"
11812,THE MASTER,"Met rancor with a cryptic mirth,"
11813,THE MASTER,Laconic—and Olympian.
11814,THE MASTER,
11815,THE MASTER,"The love, the grandeur, and the fame"
11816,THE MASTER,Are bounded by the world alone;
11817,THE MASTER,"The calm, the smouldering, and the flame"
11818,THE MASTER,Of awful patience were his own:
11819,THE MASTER,With him they are forever flown
11820,THE MASTER,"Past all our fond self-shadowings,"
11821,THE MASTER,Wherewith we cumber the Unknown
11822,THE MASTER,"As with inept, Icarian wings."
11823,THE MASTER,
11824,THE MASTER,For we were not as other men:
11825,THE MASTER,’Twas ours to soar and his to see.
11826,THE MASTER,"But we are coming down again,"
11827,THE MASTER,And we shall come down pleasantly;
11828,THE MASTER,Nor shall we longer disagree
11829,THE MASTER,"On what it is to be sublime,"
11830,THE MASTER,But flourish in our perigee
11831,THE MASTER,And have one Titan at a time.
11832,THE MASTER,

11837,JOHN GORHAM,Sighing hard and seeming to be sorry when you’re not.
11838,JOHN GORHAM,"Make me laugh or let me go now, for long faces in the moonlight"
11839,JOHN GORHAM,Are a sign for me to say again a word that you forgot.”
11840,JOHN GORHAM,
11841,JOHN GORHAM,“I’m over here to tell you what the moon already
11842,JOHN GORHAM,May have said or maybe shouted ever since a year ago;
11843,JOHN GORHAM,"I’m over here to tell you what you are, Jane Wayland,"
11844,JOHN GORHAM,"And to make you rather sorry, I should say, for being so.”"
11845,JOHN GORHAM,
11846,JOHN GORHAM,"“Tell me what you’re saying to me now, John Gorham,"

11848,JOHN GORHAM,"I’ll vanish in as many ways as I have toes and fingers,"
11849,JOHN GORHAM,And you’ll not follow far for one where flocks have been before.”
11850,JOHN GORHAM,
11851,JOHN GORHAM,"“I’m sorry now you never saw the flocks, Jane Wayland;"
11852,JOHN GORHAM,But you’re the one to make of them as many as you need.
11853,JOHN GORHAM,And then about the vanishing: it’s I who mean to vanish;
11854,JOHN GORHAM,And when I’m here no longer you’ll be done with me indeed.”
11855,JOHN GORHAM,
11856,JOHN GORHAM,"“That’s a way to tell me what I am, John Gorham!"
11857,JOHN GORHAM,How am I to know myself until I make you smile?
11858,JOHN GORHAM,"Try to look as if the moon were making faces at you,"
11859,JOHN GORHAM,And a little more as if you meant to stay a little while.”
11860,JOHN GORHAM,
11861,JOHN GORHAM,“You are what it is that over rose-blown gardens
11862,JOHN GORHAM,Makes a pretty flutter for a season in the sun.
11863,JOHN GORHAM,"You are what it is that with a mouse, Jane Wayland,"
11864,JOHN GORHAM,Catches him and let’s him go and eats him up for fun.”
11865,JOHN GORHAM,
11866,JOHN GORHAM,"“Sure I never took you for a mouse, John Gorham."
11867,JOHN GORHAM,"All you say is easy, but so far from being true"
11868,JOHN GORHAM,That I wish you wouldn’t ever be again the one to think so;
11869,JOHN GORHAM,For it isn’t cats and butterflies that I would be to you.”
11870,JOHN GORHAM,
11871,JOHN GORHAM,“All your little animals are in one picture—
11872,JOHN GORHAM,One I’ve had before me since a year ago to-night;
11873,JOHN GORHAM,"And the picture where they live will be of you, Jane Wayland,"
11874,JOHN GORHAM,Till you find a way to kill them or to keep them out of sight.”
11875,JOHN GORHAM,
11876,JOHN GORHAM,"“Won’t you ever see me as I am, John Gorham,"
11877,JOHN GORHAM,Leaving out the foolishness and all I never meant?
11878,JOHN GORHAM,"Somewhere in me there’s a woman, if you know the way to find her—"
11879,JOHN GORHAM,Will you like me any better if I prove it and repent?”
11880,JOHN GORHAM,
11881,JOHN GORHAM,"“I doubt if I shall ever have the time, Jane Wayland;"
11882,JOHN GORHAM,And I dare say all this moonlight lying round us might as well
11883,JOHN GORHAM,"Fall for nothing on the shards of broken urns that are forgotten,"
11884,JOHN GORHAM,As on two that have no longer much of anything to tell.”

11893,RICHARD CORY,
11894,RICHARD CORY,"And he was always quietly arrayed,"
11895,RICHARD CORY,And he was always human when he talked;
11896,RICHARD CORY,"But still he fluttered pulses when he said,"
11897,RICHARD CORY,"“Good-morning,” and he glittered when he walked."
11898,RICHARD CORY,
11899,RICHARD CORY,"And he was rich—yes, richer than a king,"
11900,RICHARD CORY,And admirably schooled in every grace:
11901,RICHARD CORY,"In fine, we thought that he was everything"
11902,RICHARD CORY,To make us wish that we were in his place.
11903,RICHARD CORY,
11904,RICHARD CORY,"So on we worked, and waited for the light,"
11905,RICHARD CORY,"And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;"

11907,RICHARD CORY,Went home and put a bullet through his head.

12868,HATE,"My lips went writhing back in a grimace,"
12869,HATE,And stern I watched him with a narrow eye.
12870,HATE,"Then, as I turned away, my enemy,"
12871,HATE,"That bitter heart and savage, said to me:"
12872,HATE,"“Some day, when this is past,"
12873,HATE,"When all the arrows that we have are cast,"

12876,HATE,It may seem to us then a mystery
12877,HATE,That we could hate each other.”
12878,HATE,"Thus said he,"
12879,HATE,"And did not turn away,"
12880,HATE,Waiting to hear what I might have to say.
12881,HATE,"But I fled quickly, fearing if I stayed"

12892,I,I’m as frightened as a maid.
12893,I,
12894,I,The couching lion there I saw
12895,I,From barren rocks lift up his eye;
12896,I,"He parts the cactus with his paw,"
12897,I,He stares at me as I go by.
12898,I,
12899,I,He would follow on my trace
12900,I,"If he knew I was afraid,"
12901,I,If he knew my hardy face
12902,I,Hides the terrors of a maid.
12903,I,
12904,I,In the night he rises and
12905,I,"He stretches forth, he snuffs the air;"
12906,I,"He roars and leaps along the sand,"
12907,I,He creeps and watches everywhere.
12908,I,
12909,I,"His burning eyes, his eyes of bale,"
12910,I,Through the darkness I can see;
12911,I,"He lashes fiercely with his tail,"
12912,I,He would love to spring at me.
12913,I,
12914,I,I am the lion in his lair;
12915,I,I am the fear that frightens me;
12916,I,I am the desert of despair
12917,I,And the nights of agony.
12918,I,
12919,I,"Night or day, whate’er befall,"

12930,II,
12931,II,"There I go: the deepest shade,"
12932,II,The deepest silence pressing me;
12933,II,And my heart is more afraid
12934,II,Than a maiden’s heart would be.
12935,II,
12936,II,Every day I have to run
12937,II,"Underneath the demon tree,"

12945,II,
12946,II,"And she beckoned me to run,"
12947,II,"And she called for help to me,"
12948,II,And the ancient wrong was done
12949,II,Which is done eternally.
12950,II,
12951,II,I am the maiden and the fear;
12952,II,"I am the sunless shade, the strife;"
12953,II,"I the demon lips, the sneer"
12954,II,Showing under every life.
12955,II,
12956,II,I must tread that gloomy way

13659,MORNING,I went out on an April morning
13660,MORNING,"All alone, for my heart was high."
13661,MORNING,"I was a child of the shining meadow,"
13662,MORNING,I was a sister of the sky.
13663,MORNING,
13664,MORNING,There in the windy flood of morning
13665,MORNING,"Longing lifted its weight from me,"
13666,MORNING,"Lost as a sob in the midst of cheering,"
13667,MORNING,Swept as a sea-bird out to sea.

13671,THE FLIGHT,
13672,THE FLIGHT,"Look back with longing eyes and know that I will follow,"
13673,THE FLIGHT,"Lift me up in your love as a light wing lifts a swallow,"
13674,THE FLIGHT,Let our flight be far in sun or windy rain—
13675,THE FLIGHT,_But what if I heard my first love calling me again?_
13676,THE FLIGHT,
13677,THE FLIGHT,"Hold me on your heart as the brave sea holds the foam,"
13678,THE FLIGHT,Take me far away to the hills that hide your home;
13679,THE FLIGHT,Peace shall thatch the roof and love shall latch the door—
13680,THE FLIGHT,_But what if I heard my first love calling me once more?_
13681,THE FLIGHT,

13683,OVER THE ROOFS,OVER THE ROOFS
13684,OVER THE ROOFS,
13685,OVER THE ROOFS,"I said, “I have shut my heart,"
13686,OVER THE ROOFS,"As one shuts an open door,"
13687,OVER THE ROOFS,That Love may starve therein
13688,OVER THE ROOFS,And trouble me no more.”
13689,OVER THE ROOFS,
13690,OVER THE ROOFS,But over the roofs there came
13691,OVER THE ROOFS,"The wet new wind of May,"
13692,OVER THE ROOFS,And a tune blew up from the curb
13693,OVER THE ROOFS,Where the street-pianos play.
13694,OVER THE ROOFS,
13695,OVER THE ROOFS,My room was white with the sun
13696,OVER THE ROOFS,"And Love cried out in me,"
13697,OVER THE ROOFS,"“I am strong, I will break your heart"
13698,OVER THE ROOFS,Unless you set me free.”

13823,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,The wind runs laughing down the sky
13824,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,That brims with morning like a cup.
13825,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,"Sprite, we must race him,"
13826,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,We must chase him—
13827,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,You and I!
13828,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,And skim across the fuzzy heather—
13829,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,You and joy and I together
13830,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,Whirling by!
13831,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,
13832,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,You merry little roll of fat!—
13833,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,"Made warm to kiss, and smooth to pat,"
13834,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,"And round to toy with, like a cub;"
13835,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,To put one’s nozzle in and rub
13836,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,"And breathe you in like breath of kine,"
13837,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,"Like juice of vine,"
13838,THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE,"That sets my morning heart a-tingling,"

13900,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Beneath my window in a city street
13901,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"A monster lairs, a creature huge and grim"
13902,THE STEAM SHOVEL,And only half believed: the strength of him—
13903,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Steel-strung and fit to meet
13904,THE STEAM SHOVEL,The strength of earth—
13905,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Is mighty as men’s dreams that conquer force.
13906,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Steam belches from him. He is the new birth
13907,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Of old Behemoth, late-sprung from the source"
13908,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Whence Grendel sprang, and all the monster clan"
13909,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Dead for an age, now born again of man."

13914,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Moist floor, with nose dropped in the dirt, at beck"
13915,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Of some incredible control.
13916,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"He snorts, and pauses couchant for a space,"
13917,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Then slowly lifts, and tears the gaping hole"
13918,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Yet deeper in earth’s flank. A sudden race
13919,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Of loosened earth and pebbles trickles there
13920,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Like blood-drops in a wound.
13921,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"But he, the monster, swings his load around—"
13922,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Weightless it seems as air.
13923,THE STEAM SHOVEL,His mammoth jaw
13924,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Drops widely open with a rasping sound,"
13925,THE STEAM SHOVEL,And all the red earth vomits from his maw.
13926,THE STEAM SHOVEL,
13927,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"O thwarted monster, born at man’s decree,"
13928,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"A lap-dog dragon, eating from his hand"
13929,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"And doomed to fetch and carry at command,"
13930,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Have you no longing ever to be free?
13931,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"In warm, electric days to run a-muck,"
13932,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Ranging like some mad dinosaur,"
13933,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Your fiery heart at war
13934,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"With this strange world, the city’s restless ruck,"
13935,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Where all drab things that toil, save you alone,"
13936,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Have life;
13937,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"And you the semblance only, and the strife?"
13938,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Do you not yearn to rip the roots of stone
13939,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Of these great piles men build,"
13940,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"And hurl them down with shriek of shattered steel,"
13941,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Scorning your own sure doom, so you may feel,"
13942,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"You too, the lust with which your fathers killed?"
13943,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Or is your soul in very deed so tame,"
13944,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"The blood of Grendel watered to a gruel,"
13945,THE STEAM SHOVEL,That you are well content
13946,THE STEAM SHOVEL,With heart of flame
13947,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Thus placidly to chew your cud of fuel
13948,THE STEAM SHOVEL,And toil in peace for man’s aggrandizement?
13949,THE STEAM SHOVEL,
13950,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Poor helpless creature of a half-grown god,"
13951,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Blind of yourself and impotent!
13952,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"At night,"
13953,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"When your forerunners, sprung from quicker sod,"
13954,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Would range through primal woods, hot on the scent,"
13955,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Or wake the stars with amorous delight,"
13956,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"You stand, a soiled, unwieldy mass of steel,"
13957,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"Black in the arc-light, modern as your name,"
13958,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Dead and unsouled and trite;
13959,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Till I must feel
13960,THE STEAM SHOVEL,
13961,THE STEAM SHOVEL,A quick creator’s pity for your shame:
13962,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"That man, who made you and who gave so much,"
13963,THE STEAM SHOVEL,Yet cannot give the last transforming touch;
13964,THE STEAM SHOVEL,That with the work he cannot give the wage—
13965,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"For day, no joy of night,"
13966,THE STEAM SHOVEL,"For toil, no ecstasy of primal rage."

13971,THE GREAT MAN,I cannot always feel his greatness.
13972,THE GREAT MAN,"Sometimes he walks beside me, step by step,"
13973,THE GREAT MAN,And paces slowly in the ways—
13974,THE GREAT MAN,"The simple, wingless ways"
13975,THE GREAT MAN,"That my thoughts tread. He gossips with me then,"
13976,THE GREAT MAN,And finds it good;
13977,THE GREAT MAN,"Not as an eagle might, his great wings folded, be content"
13978,THE GREAT MAN,"To walk a little, knowing it his choice,"
13979,THE GREAT MAN,"But as a simple man,"
13980,THE GREAT MAN,My friend.
13981,THE GREAT MAN,And I forget.
13982,THE GREAT MAN,

13985,THE GREAT MAN,"The great keen, lonely heights of being."
13986,THE GREAT MAN,And he who was my comrade hears the call
13987,THE GREAT MAN,"And rises from my side, and soars,"
13988,THE GREAT MAN,"Deep-chanting, to the heights."
13989,THE GREAT MAN,Then I remember.
13990,THE GREAT MAN,"And my upward gaze goes with him, and I see"

14006,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,"Between the bars, and like an age"
14007,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,The hours are long tonight.
14008,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,
14009,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,The sky is like a heavy lid
14010,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,Out here beyond the door tonight.
14011,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,What’s that? A mutter down the street.
14012,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,What’s that? The sound of yells and feet.
14013,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,For what you didn’t do or did
14014,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,You’ll pay the score tonight.
14015,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,
14016,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,"No use to reek with reddened sweat,"
14017,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,No use to whimper and to sweat.
14018,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,"They’ve got the rope; they’ve got the guns,"

14020,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,And that’s the reason why tonight
14021,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,No use to ask them any more.
14022,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,They’ll fire the answer through the door—
14023,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,You’re out to die tonight.
14024,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,
14025,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,"There where the lonely cross-road lies,"
14026,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,There is no place to make replies;
14027,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,"But silence, inch by inch, is there,"
14028,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,And the right limb for a lynch is there;

14030,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,Blackbird.
14031,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,
14032,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,Perhaps you’ll meet again some place.
14033,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,Look for the mask upon the face:
14034,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,That’s the way you’ll know them there—
14035,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,
14036,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,A white mask to hide the face.
14037,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,And you can halt and show them there
14038,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,"The things that they are deaf to now,"
14039,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,And they can tell you what they meant—
14040,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,To wash the blood with blood. But how
14041,THE BIRD AND THE TREE,If you are innocent?

14086,BEYOND THE STARS,"Tall candles burned about me in the dark,"
14087,BEYOND THE STARS,"And a great crucifix was on my breast,"

14092,BEYOND THE STARS,"Another came whom I had loved on earth,"
14093,BEYOND THE STARS,And kissed my brow and brushed my dampened hair.
14094,BEYOND THE STARS,"Softly she spoke: “Oh, that he should not see"
14095,BEYOND THE STARS,The April that his spirit bathed in! Birds
14096,BEYOND THE STARS,"Are singing in the orchard, and the grass"
14097,BEYOND THE STARS,That soon will cover him is growing green.
14098,BEYOND THE STARS,"The daisies whiten on the emerald hills,"
14099,BEYOND THE STARS,And the immortal magic that he loved

14102,BEYOND THE STARS,"Like a tremendous lantern shine in heaven,"
14103,BEYOND THE STARS,And I could only think of him—and sob.
14104,BEYOND THE STARS,For I remembered evenings wonderful
14105,BEYOND THE STARS,"When he was faint with Life’s sad loveliness,"
14106,BEYOND THE STARS,And watched the silver ribbons wandering far
14107,BEYOND THE STARS,"Along the shore, and out upon the sea."
14108,BEYOND THE STARS,"Oh, I remembered how he loved the world,"

14111,BEYOND THE STARS,His tapestries that wrap the earth’s wide room.
14112,BEYOND THE STARS,I minded me of mornings filled with rain
14113,BEYOND THE STARS,When he would sit and listen to the sound
14114,BEYOND THE STARS,As if it were lost music from the spheres.
14115,BEYOND THE STARS,"He loved the crocus and the hawthorn-hedge,"
14116,BEYOND THE STARS,"He loved the shining gold of buttercups,"
14117,BEYOND THE STARS,And the low droning of the drowsy bees
14118,BEYOND THE STARS,That boomed across the meadows. He was glad
14119,BEYOND THE STARS,At dawn or sundown; glad when Autumn came
14120,BEYOND THE STARS,"With her worn livery and scarlet crown,"
14121,BEYOND THE STARS,And glad when Winter rocked the earth to rest.
14122,BEYOND THE STARS,"Strange that he sleeps today when Life is young,"

14127,BEYOND THE STARS,"I longed to open then my sealed eyes,"
14128,BEYOND THE STARS,And tell them of the glory that was mine.
14129,BEYOND THE STARS,"There was no darkness where my spirit flew,"
14130,BEYOND THE STARS,There was no night beyond the teeming world.
14131,BEYOND THE STARS,Their April was like winter where I roamed;
14132,BEYOND THE STARS,Their flowers were like stones where now I fared.

14139,BEYOND THE STARS,Whom God had snatched from penury and pain
14140,BEYOND THE STARS,To draw across the barricades of heaven.
14141,BEYOND THE STARS,"I clomb beyond the sun, beyond the moon;"
14142,BEYOND THE STARS,In flight on flight I touched the highest star;

14150,BEYOND THE STARS,"I was the rain,"
14151,BEYOND THE STARS,"I was the dawn, I was the purple east,"
14152,BEYOND THE STARS,"I was the moonlight on enchanted nights,"
14153,BEYOND THE STARS,(Yet time was lost to me); I was a flower
14154,BEYOND THE STARS,"For one to pluck who loved me; I was bliss,"
14155,BEYOND THE STARS,"And rapture, splendid moments of delight;"
14156,BEYOND THE STARS,"And I was prayer, and solitude, and hope;"
14157,BEYOND THE STARS,"And always, always, always I was love."
14158,BEYOND THE STARS,"I tore asunder flimsy doors of time,"
14159,BEYOND THE STARS,And through the windows of my soul’s new sight
14160,BEYOND THE STARS,I saw beyond the ultimate bounds of space.
14161,BEYOND THE STARS,I was all things that I had loved on earth—
14162,BEYOND THE STARS,"The very moonbeam in that quiet room,"
14163,BEYOND THE STARS,"The very sunlight one had dreamed I lost,"
14164,BEYOND THE STARS,"The soul of the returning April grass,"
14165,BEYOND THE STARS,"The spirit of the evening and the dawn,"
14166,BEYOND THE STARS,The perfume in unnumbered hawthorn-blooms.
14167,BEYOND THE STARS,"There was no shadow on my perfect peace,"
14168,BEYOND THE STARS,No knowledge that was hidden from my heart.
14169,BEYOND THE STARS,I learned what music meant; I read the years;
14170,BEYOND THE STARS,"I found where rainbows hide, where tears begin;"
14171,BEYOND THE STARS,I trod the precincts of things yet unborn.

14850,STUDENTS,"John gave the keeper two whole sous,"

14863,STUDENTS,Through one long alley how they raced!—

14866,STUDENTS,Shades of mad queens and hunter-kings

14894,STUDENTS,"Kiss, clink of glasses, laughter heard,"

14898,STUDENTS,Will pay him!—“Let’s play millionaire

14947,A WOMAN’S BELOVED,"A woman’s beloved is to her a great void that she may illumine,"

15228,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Our day is short, but our beauty is eternal.”"
15229,THE POET IN THE DESERT,
15230,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Never have I found a place, or a season, without beauty."

15233,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Nor the Desert, bride of the Sun, which sits scornful, apart,"
15234,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Like an unwooed princess, careless, indifferent."
15235,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She spreads her garments, wonderful beyond estimation,"
15236,THE POET IN THE DESERT,And embroiders continually her mantle.
15237,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is a queen, seated on a throne of gold"
15238,THE POET IN THE DESERT,In the Hall of Silence.
15239,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She insists upon humility.
15240,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She insists upon meditation.
15241,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She insists that the soul be free.
15242,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She requires an answer.
15243,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She demands the final reply to thoughts which cannot be answered.
15244,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She lights the sun for a torch
15245,THE POET IN THE DESERT,And sets up the great cliffs as sentinels:
15246,THE POET IN THE DESERT,The morning and the evening are curtains before her chambers.
15247,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She displays the stars as her coronet.
15248,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is cruel and invites victims,"
15249,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Restlessly moving her wrists and ankles,"
15250,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Which are loaded with sapphires.
15251,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Her brown breasts flash with opals.
15252,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She slays those who fear her,"
15253,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"But runs her hand lovingly over the brow of those who know her,"
15254,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Soothing with a voluptuous caress.
15255,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is a courtesan, wearing jewels,"
15256,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Enticing, smiling a bold smile;"
15257,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Adjusting her brilliant raiment negligently,"
15258,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Lying brooding upon her floor which is richly carpeted;
15259,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Her brown thighs beautiful and naked.
15260,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She toys with the dazzelry of her diadems,"
15261,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Smiling inscrutably.
15262,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is a nun, withdrawing behind her veil;"
15263,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Gray, subdued, silent, mysterious, meditative; unapproachable."
15264,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is fair as a goddess sitting beneath a flowering peach-tree, beside"
15265,THE POET IN THE DESERT,a clear river.
15266,THE POET IN THE DESERT,
15267,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Her body is tawny with the eagerness of the Sun
15268,THE POET IN THE DESERT,And her eyes are like pools which shine in deep cañons.
15269,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is beautiful as a swart woman, with opals at her throat,"
15270,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Rubies on her wrists and topaz about her ankles.
15271,THE POET IN THE DESERT,Her breasts are like the evening and the day stars;

15276,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She sings a song unto her own ears, solitary, but it is sufficient—"
15277,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"It is the song of her being. Oh, if I may sing the song of my being it"
15278,THE POET IN THE DESERT,will be sufficient.
15279,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"She is like a jeweled dancer, dancing upon a pavement of gold;"
15280,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"Dazzling, so that the eyes must be shaded."
15281,THE POET IN THE DESERT,She wears the stars upon her bosom and braids her hair with the
15282,THE POET IN THE DESERT,constellations.
15283,THE POET IN THE DESERT,
15284,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"I know the Desert is beautiful, for I have lain in her arms and she has"

15286,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"I have come to her, that I may know freedom;"
15287,THE POET IN THE DESERT,That I may lie upon the breast of the Mother and breathe the air of
15288,THE POET IN THE DESERT,primal conditions.
15289,THE POET IN THE DESERT,I have come out from the haunts of men;
15290,THE POET IN THE DESERT,"From the struggle of wolves upon a carcass,"
15291,THE POET IN THE DESERT,To be melted in Creation’s crucible and be made clean;
