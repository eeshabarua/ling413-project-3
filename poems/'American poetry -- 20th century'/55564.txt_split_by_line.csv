2031,_B.C. 140._,"And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,"
2032,_B.C. 140._,"To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as blue jade,"
2033,_B.C. 140._,"With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,"

2358,RIGHT,"One at Chalais, another at Malemort"
2359,RIGHT,"Hard over Brive--for every lady a castle,"
2360,RIGHT,Each place strong.
2361,RIGHT,
2362,RIGHT,"Oh, _is_ it easy enough?"
2363,RIGHT,"Tairiran held hall in Montaignac,"
2364,RIGHT,His brother-in-law was all there was of power
2365,RIGHT,"In Perigord, and this good union"
2366,RIGHT,"Gobbled all the land, and held it later"
2367,RIGHT,for some hundreds years.
2368,RIGHT,"And our En Bertrans was in Altafort,"
2369,RIGHT,"Hub of the wheel, the stirrer-up of strife,"
2370,RIGHT,As caught by Dante in the last wallow of hell--
2371,RIGHT,The headless trunk “that made its head a lamp.”
2372,RIGHT,"For separation wrought out separation,"
2373,RIGHT,And he who set the strife between brother and brother
2374,RIGHT,"And had his way with the old English king,"

2377,RIGHT,"How would you live, with neighbours set about you--"
2378,RIGHT,"Poictiers and Brive, untaken Rochechouart,"

2381,RIGHT,"Not a neat ledge, not Foix between its streams,"
2382,RIGHT,"But one huge back half-covered up with pine,"
2383,RIGHT,Worked for and snatched from the string-purse of Born--

2402,RIGHT,And Maent failed him? Or saw through the scheme?
2403,RIGHT,
2404,RIGHT,And all his net-like thought of new alliance?
2405,RIGHT,"Chalais is high, a-level with the poplars."
2406,RIGHT,Its lowest stones just meet the valley tips
2407,RIGHT,Where the low Dronne is filled with water-lilies.
2408,RIGHT,"And Rochechouart can match it, stronger yet,"
2409,RIGHT,"The very spur’s end, built on sheerest cliff,"
2410,RIGHT,"And Malemort keeps its close hold on Brive,"
2411,RIGHT,"While Born his own close purse, his rabbit warren,"
2412,RIGHT,"His subterranean chamber with a dozen doors,"
2413,RIGHT,"A-bristle with antennae to feel roads,"
2414,RIGHT,To sniff the traffic into Perigord.
2415,RIGHT,"And that hard phalanx, that unbroken line,"
2416,RIGHT,"The ten good miles from thence to Maent’s castle,"
2417,RIGHT,All of his flank--how could he do without her?

2421,RIGHT,"“Papiol,"

2427,RIGHT,What doors are open to fine compliment?”
2428,RIGHT,And every one half jealous of Maent?

2430,RIGHT,"Against her, give her pride in them?"
2431,RIGHT,
2432,RIGHT,"Take his own speech, make what you will of it--"
2433,RIGHT,"And still the knot, the first knot, of Maent?"

2508,II,Dispraises his own skill?--That’s as you will.
2509,II,"And they discuss the dead man,"
2510,II,Plantagenet puts the riddle: “Did he love her?”
2511,II,And Arnaut parries: “Did he love your sister?
2512,II,"True, he has praised her, but in some opinion"
2513,II,He wrote that praise only to show he had
2514,II,"The favour of your party, had been well received.”"
