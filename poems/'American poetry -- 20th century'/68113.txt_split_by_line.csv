357,PREFACE,"Most kind and gracious Madame Stork right over Norfolk flew,"
358,PREFACE,"And brought to my dear mother there a wonderful surprise,"
359,PREFACE,A little red brown baby girl with large blackberry eyes.
360,PREFACE,"Now, mother she had asked the stork to bring to her much joy,"
361,PREFACE,"And drop a bundle at her door containing a wee boy,"
362,PREFACE,"But when the stork made a mistake and brought just little me,"
363,PREFACE,She thought that I was better far than any boy could be.
364,PREFACE,"And wrapped me in the blanket which she'd planned for my wee brother,"
365,PREFACE,"And which my dear ""MA MIE"" had knit to help my busy mother."
366,PREFACE,"She changed the name of Lionel to little Winifred,"

375,PREFACE,
376,PREFACE,[Illustration: SANTA'S AEROPLANE]
377,PREFACE,
378,PREFACE,
379,PREFACE,"Long, long ago, before this earth had any girls and boys"
380,PREFACE,"To hang their stockings on the shelf, expecting Christmas toys,"
381,PREFACE,Good Santa was a big white cloud that floated in the sky;
382,PREFACE,"if you had lived in those old days, you'd seen him floating by."
383,PREFACE,
384,PREFACE,"But when the children came to rule upon good Mother Earth,"
385,PREFACE,She took kind Santa from the sky and made him God of Mirth;
386,PREFACE,To bring at every Christmas time good gifts to girls and boys
387,PREFACE,And make them all so happy with a lot of lovely toys.
388,PREFACE,
389,PREFACE,"Far, far among the icebergs, in the cold and freezing zone,"
390,PREFACE,"She built for him a palace, where he lives almost alone,"
391,PREFACE,"With only good old Mrs. Claus to keep him company,"
392,PREFACE,And sometimes Cousin Nicholas for two days or for three.
393,PREFACE,
394,PREFACE,"Wise Mother Earth she knew this clime would suit good Santa well,"
395,PREFACE,"For here no foolish, idle folks would ever come to dwell;"
396,PREFACE,"Nor pay the good Saint visits which would waste his precious time,"
397,PREFACE,While he could work much faster here than in a warmer clime.
398,PREFACE,
399,PREFACE,"But never did he suffer from the icebergs at the Pole,"
400,PREFACE,As Fairies kept his fireplace all full of red hot coal;
401,PREFACE,"Or heaped bright burning logs on it as full as it could hold,"
402,PREFACE,So Santa never felt at all old Jack Frost's biting cold.
403,PREFACE,
404,PREFACE,"Likewise these Fairies brought to him and his most faithful spouse,"
405,PREFACE,"Just everything that they could need to keep a cozy house,"
406,PREFACE,And even cooked their victuals and brought them every day
407,PREFACE,"Exactly at the proper time, upon a huge hot tray."
408,PREFACE,
409,PREFACE,"And after they had eaten all the dainties on the tiny,"
410,PREFACE,The good kind fairies they would come and take the tray away;
411,PREFACE,"So Mrs. Claus had no excuse for being cross or sad,"
412,PREFACE,Since no experience she had had with Bridgets getting mad.
413,PREFACE,
414,PREFACE,"When Santa finished all his toys, he put them in a sack,"
415,PREFACE,"Where he intended carrying them upon his great broad back,"
416,PREFACE,But Mother Earth surprised the saint and to his palace led
417,PREFACE,Eight lovely prancing reindeer and a large commodious sled.
418,PREFACE,
419,PREFACE,"These reindeer were the cousins of swift Pegasus, the steed"
420,PREFACE,Who helped the hero Perseus when he was in great need;
421,PREFACE,"And like the flying hero horse, they lived up in the sky,"
422,PREFACE,'Till Mother Earth had need of them to help old Santa fly.
423,PREFACE,
424,PREFACE,"And so on every Christmas eve for full ten hundred years,"
425,PREFACE,"Good Santa and his reindeer fleet have banished childrens' tears,"
426,PREFACE,"By bringing them 'most all the gifts their little hearts could wish,"
427,PREFACE,"And filling stockings, shoes and plates and great round pudding dish."
428,PREFACE,
429,PREFACE,"But when last Christmas came around, good Mother Earth she said,"
430,PREFACE,"""Dear Santa I have something fine for you to use instead"
431,PREFACE,"Of your good, faithful reindeer and your big old fashioned sled,"
432,PREFACE,"For here's a lovely aeroplane all painted shining red."""
433,PREFACE,
434,PREFACE,The wise old lady then declared that he could safely fly
435,PREFACE,"With this machine 'most anywhere away up in the sky,"
436,PREFACE,"And travel far, far faster than reindeer who were fleet"
437,PREFACE,But stumbled sometimes on the roofs made slippery with sleet.
438,PREFACE,
439,PREFACE,"The aeroplane could carry well a larger load of toys,"
440,PREFACE,"So he could visit more good girls and also little boys,"
441,PREFACE,"Who live in far off heathen lands where everyone's a sinner,"
442,PREFACE,But that's no reason each should do without a Christmas dinner.
443,PREFACE,
444,PREFACE,With this machine he'd save some time to look out for each pet
445,PREFACE,Of all the little girls and boys as they so oft forget
446,PREFACE,To treat their pets most kindly upon the Christmas morn
447,PREFACE,"In memory of the Saviour, who on this day was born."
448,PREFACE,
449,PREFACE,"And likewise all the horses, the cows and pigs and sheep,"
450,PREFACE,For men so seldom think of them when Christmas time they keep;
451,PREFACE,"And even wild, fierce animals, and fishes in the sea,"
452,PREFACE,Should all be made quite happy at Christmas time to be.
453,PREFACE,
454,PREFACE,"""I do not like this plan at all of giving up my sled"
455,PREFACE,"And my good faithful reindeer,"" so good old Santa said."
456,PREFACE,But Mother Earth she laughed at him and said she would repay
457,PREFACE,"The reindeer, whom she would send home, straight to the milky way."
458,PREFACE,
459,PREFACE,But Santa was old fashioned and had great fears to fly
460,PREFACE,"Without his sled and reindeer, he'd used in years gone by,"
461,PREFACE,And begged that on his maiden trip these true old friends to take
462,PREFACE,To help him should the aeroplane prove but a wicked fake.
463,PREFACE,
464,PREFACE,"The laughing Earth she granted him this very small request,"
465,PREFACE,"And early on glad Christmas eve (the eve of all most blest),"
466,PREFACE,"He started forth upon his trip, did good old Santa, dear,"
467,PREFACE,Guiding his Wright aeroplane with feelings of great fear.
468,PREFACE,
469,PREFACE,But Mother Earth showed she was wise and knew just what was best
470,PREFACE,To help the good old tired saint while on his children quest;
471,PREFACE,"And fast the good Wright aeroplane it flew both low and high,"
472,PREFACE,"So Santa took the Earth's advice, and though he heaved a sigh,"
473,PREFACE,
474,PREFACE,"He dropped the poor old worn out sled as he was passing by,"
475,PREFACE,"And people said, who saw it fall, ""A METEOR FROM THE SKY!"""
476,PREFACE,"Then kissing each good reindeer, he bade them all farewell,"
477,PREFACE,"And left them in the MILKY WAY, forever there to dwell."
478,PREFACE,
479,PREFACE,"And you, my little children, who have heard the tiny hoofs"
480,PREFACE,"Of the little flying steeds pattering on the roofs,"
481,PREFACE,"If you would like to catch a glimpse of Santa's good reindeer,"
482,PREFACE,"Then wait until it's dark some night, and when the sky is clear,"
483,PREFACE,"You'll see them very plainly in the broad light MILKY WAY,"
484,PREFACE,"And there for all the time to come, these steeds will romp and play."

525,PREFACE,"But he's a naughty brownie, so short and very small;"
526,PREFACE,"Not a bit like Santa, who is large and fat and tall."
527,PREFACE,
528,PREFACE,"But like our good gift giver, his beard is long and white,"
529,PREFACE,And he wears a coat of furs and many colors bright;
530,PREFACE,"But instead of bringing goodies to good girls and to boys,"
531,PREFACE,Nice new clothes and books and games and lots of wondrous toys.
532,PREFACE,
533,PREFACE,"He expects that all the big folks and also little ones,"
534,PREFACE,"Should leave his favorite dishes, such as puddings, cakes and buns,"
535,PREFACE,"Outside of every doorway, so that he may eat at will"
536,PREFACE,Of these luscious dainties until he has had his fill.
537,PREFACE,
538,PREFACE,"Then after eating all the cakes his ""Tummy-tum"" can hold,"
539,PREFACE,"He milks the cows and splits the wood (at least so I've been told),"
540,PREFACE,"But never thinks to bring nice gifts to little girls and boys,"
541,PREFACE,Whose parents have to trim their trees and buy them all their toys.

544,PREFACE,"And does all sorts of horrid tricks, which I think very sad"
545,PREFACE,"At Christmas, when we all should be so kind to one another"
546,PREFACE,And treat each person whom we meet as if he were our brother.
547,PREFACE,
548,PREFACE,"But NISSEN steals away the cows and even horses fleet,"
549,PREFACE,From all the people who forget to bake him puddings sweet;
550,PREFACE,And if above a whisper one should dare to speak or sing
551,PREFACE,"About this cranky fellow, then this evil he will bring"
552,PREFACE,"Upon the one who dared to throw, his name upon the breeze,"
553,PREFACE,As from that time the guilty one must sneeze and sneeze and sneeze.
554,PREFACE,
555,PREFACE,"Now in our land we sing loud praise of Santa all the time,"
556,PREFACE,"And tell about his goodness great, in prose and jingling rhyme;"
557,PREFACE,"And yet it seems the more we sing about the jolly elf,"
558,PREFACE,The more he brings each year to us upon the mantel shelf.
559,PREFACE,
560,PREFACE,But children in far Norway are better girls and boys
561,PREFACE,"Than we who live in this fair land and think so much of toys,"
562,PREFACE,"That we forget about the pets while feeding our own selves,"
563,PREFACE,"Like thoughtless, greedy little pigs or naughty selfish elves."
564,PREFACE,

1197,MOTHER.,
1198,MOTHER.,"(Written for Mrs. Anna Chase Brainard, of Buffalo, N. Y.)"
1199,MOTHER.,
1200,MOTHER.,
1201,MOTHER.,"Once there was a little pup who lived in far off Kent,"
1202,MOTHER.,Where he was born some years ago in kennels of Lord Dent;
1203,MOTHER.,"His mother was of purest blood and likewise was his Pa,"
1204,MOTHER.,So he arrived upon this earth without a single flaw.
1205,MOTHER.,
1206,MOTHER.,"His tail was just the proper size and so was each small ear,"
1207,MOTHER.,"His shapely legs and nose and paws, they pleased his mother dear;"
1208,MOTHER.,And with her soft and scarlet tongue she kissed her baby pup
1209,MOTHER.,"And loved him, oh, so dearly, that she almost ate him up."
1210,MOTHER.,
1211,MOTHER.,"The keeper of the kennels when he saw this terrier pup,"
1212,MOTHER.,"Declared, ""It's just a beauty and will surely win ""THE CUP"""
1213,MOTHER.,For being a fox terrier of very purest breed
1214,MOTHER.,And now to my dear master I'll go with greatest speed
1215,MOTHER.,
1216,MOTHER.,And tell him of this puppy who will bring our kennels fame
1217,MOTHER.,And ask him what he thinks will be a truly proper name
1218,MOTHER.,For the most perfect terrier that ever came to Kent;
1219,MOTHER.,"It seems to me he should be called for my great master ""Dent."""
1220,MOTHER.,
1221,MOTHER.,"The master when he heard the news that a new pup had come,"
1222,MOTHER.,"Left off his game of playing cards and drinking pints of rum,"
1223,MOTHER.,"And hastened to the kennels to behold the wondrous pup,"
1224,MOTHER.,Who at the coming dog show was to win the great prize cup.
1225,MOTHER.,
1226,MOTHER.,"The mother dog she wagged her tail, with pride she was puffed up,"
1227,MOTHER.,"As her great master stood right near and smiled upon her pup,"
1228,MOTHER.,"While saying, ""Higgens, listen well to what I have to say,"
1229,MOTHER.,And care for this good mother dog and her fine pup each day.
1230,MOTHER.,
1231,MOTHER.,"I'll name him for my ancestor, the great and famous Kent,"
1232,MOTHER.,"And in that name to the dog show next year he shall be sent,"
1233,MOTHER.,Where I am sure he'll win the prize above all others there
1234,MOTHER.,"For he is perfect in his shape and has fine silky hair."""
1235,MOTHER.,
1236,MOTHER.,"So little Kent was tended well and petted every day,"
1237,MOTHER.,"He never had to seek for bones and only had to play,"
1238,MOTHER.,"And having nothing else to do on mischief he was bent,"
1239,MOTHER.,"Was this aristocratic pup, owned by the great Lord Dent."
1240,MOTHER.,
1241,MOTHER.,"And when a year had passed around, one day the master came"
1242,MOTHER.,"To take him to the London show, where he would win great fame;"
1243,MOTHER.,"But Kent was very naughty, as he did not wish to go"
1244,MOTHER.,Away from his good kennel home to any prize dog show.
1245,MOTHER.,
1246,MOTHER.,"At last his master whipped Pup Kent and oh, but he did swear"
1247,MOTHER.,"Because Kent snapped at Higgens, who was combing his fine hair"
1248,MOTHER.,And putting on a collar with a chain of golden beads;
1249,MOTHER.,Such ornaments Kent could not see that any puppy needs.
1250,MOTHER.,
1251,MOTHER.,"At last the royal pup was dressed in pupdom regal style,"
1252,MOTHER.,"And drove in a fine carriage, oh, for many a weary mile,"
1253,MOTHER.,"Until he came to London town, where nothing he could see,"
1254,MOTHER.,Because all things were bidden with a fog as thick as could be.
1255,MOTHER.,
1256,MOTHER.,"Before he'd even time to think, this 'ristocratic pup,"
1257,MOTHER.,"He found himself in a small cage with all the doors shut up,"
1258,MOTHER.,"And many men were standing round and gazing long at him,"
1259,MOTHER.,"While passing comments on his shape of head, and tail, and limb."
1260,MOTHER.,
1261,MOTHER.,"Kent glared at them in silence and he would not wag his tail,"
1262,MOTHER.,In fact just like a good young boy who might be put in jail
1263,MOTHER.,"When he had never done a thing to break the country's law,"
1264,MOTHER.,"So felt this little terrier, this pup without a flaw."
1265,MOTHER.,
1266,MOTHER.,And when the judges thought that he should have the ribbon blue
1267,MOTHER.,"Because of his most perfect blood shown by the records true,"
1268,MOTHER.,He snapped and barked and even bit at those who came quite near
1269,MOTHER.,"To tie the lovely ribbon on the neck of ""PUPPY DEAR."""
1270,MOTHER.,
1271,MOTHER.,So they decided that despite his wondrous pedigree
1272,MOTHER.,There yet was something in his blood that ought not there to be
1273,MOTHER.,"And gave the prize, a silver cup, to a more common dog,"
1274,MOTHER.,Who lay so still and quiet that he might have been a log.
1275,MOTHER.,
1276,MOTHER.,But when that evening our Lord Dent beheld with great surprise
1277,MOTHER.,"That a less blooded terrier had won the noble prize,"
1278,MOTHER.,"He felt so very angry that he wished to beat Pup Kent,"
1279,MOTHER.,And ordered that the beastly dog should quickly home be sent.
1280,MOTHER.,
1281,MOTHER.,"But while poor Kent was going home so sad and in disgrace,"
1282,MOTHER.,He got away from Higgens and he found another place
1283,MOTHER.,"Far, far away from kennels of the great and wealthy Dent,"
1284,MOTHER.,"Near to a peaceful village, the runaway he went."
1285,MOTHER.,
1286,MOTHER.,"Here he lay down so tired and thought of many a bone,"
1287,MOTHER.,"Which now was being gnawed each day by his good ma alone,"
1288,MOTHER.,"Since Dent, her darling puppy boy, was oh, so far away,"
1289,MOTHER.,"Oh, how he wished to gnaw a bone with his good ma this day!"
1290,MOTHER.,
1291,MOTHER.,"But as he lay a dreaming of lovely things to eat,"
1292,MOTHER.,"Quite suddenly a large gray rat ran right across his feet,"
1293,MOTHER.,"And after it there followed an Irishman named Pat,"
1294,MOTHER.,Who sought to make a timely end of bad old Mister Rat.
1295,MOTHER.,
1296,MOTHER.,"Big Pat was armed with a huge club and called to his old dog,"
1297,MOTHER.,"""Now, come along ye lazy baste, before he's in the bog!"""
1298,MOTHER.,"Then Kent he jumped and in one bound he seized poor Mister Rat,"
1299,MOTHER.,Shook him about 'till he was dead and then brought him to Pat.
1300,MOTHER.,
1301,MOTHER.,"Big Pat he gazed in wonder at the clever little dog,"
1302,MOTHER.,"And sitting down upon a large and green moss covered log,"
1303,MOTHER.,"Said, ""Shure, ye bate this lazy hound that kennot catch a rat,"
1304,MOTHER.,"And if ye'll stay right here, me boy, I'll trate ye well,"" says Pat."
1305,MOTHER.,
1306,MOTHER.,Then proudly Kent he wagged his tail and tried so hard to smile
1307,MOTHER.,"Upon the good old Irishman, who patted him awhile,"
1308,MOTHER.,"Then coaxed the stranger after him right through a broad green lane,"
1309,MOTHER.,Which led to the fine country home of good Sir Michael Kane.
1310,MOTHER.,
1311,MOTHER.,"And here Pat introduced the pup to all the family,"
1312,MOTHER.,"And they were all so very kind as any folks could be,"
1313,MOTHER.,"They patted his soft silky hair and praised him to the sky,"
1314,MOTHER.,"And gave him a big gravy dish all filled with nice meat pie,"
1315,MOTHER.,"And likewise a huge saucer, which was full of real sweet cream,"
1316,MOTHER.,Which made the hungry doggie think that he was in a dream.
1317,MOTHER.,
1318,MOTHER.,"So here Dog Kent decided was the best place for to dwell,"
1319,MOTHER.,And here he still is living and is feeling very well.
1320,MOTHER.,He goes each morning to the barn and helps his good friend Pat
1321,MOTHER.,"To catch the naughty rodents, who are called the name of RAT."
1322,MOTHER.,
1323,MOTHER.,"The cook she feeds him daily, and he captures all the mice,"
1324,MOTHER.,Which love to haunt the kitchen of the cleanly Bridget Bryce.
1325,MOTHER.,"While little Mikey loves dear Kent far more than all his toys,"
1326,MOTHER.,"And says he'd rather play with him than any girls or boys,"
1327,MOTHER.,Because he never minds a bit to jump right in the pond
1328,MOTHER.,And bring to land a stick or stone or weeping willow wand.
1329,MOTHER.,
1330,MOTHER.,"He always acts politely to all who may come near,"
1331,MOTHER.,And so all strangers pet him and think he is a dear.
1332,MOTHER.,"They like his soft and silky hair, which proves he has good blood,"
1333,MOTHER.,And never does he make folks mad by tracking floors with mud.
1334,MOTHER.,
1335,MOTHER.,"He's wiser than most common dogs, whose hair is rough and coarse,"
1336,MOTHER.,"His bark is always pleasant, and 'tis never loud nor hoarse;"
1337,MOTHER.,"He's swifter also than slow dogs who cannot catch a rat,"
1338,MOTHER.,Because they always eat too much and get so very fat.
