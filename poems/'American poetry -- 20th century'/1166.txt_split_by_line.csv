41,,
42,,"It was my intention, when preparing `The Little Book of Modern Verse',"
43,,"published in 1913, to continue the series by a volume once in five years,"
44,,"but as it seemed inadvisable to issue one during the war, it is now six years"
45,,since the publication of the first volume.
46,,
47,,"In the meantime, that the series might cover the period of American poetry"
48,,"from the beginning, `The Little Book of American Poets' was edited,"
49,,"confined chiefly to work of the nineteenth century, but ending with"
50,,a group of living poets whose work has fallen equally within our own period.
51,,"This group, including Edwin Markham, Bliss Carman, Edith Thomas,"
52,,"Louise Imogen Guiney, Lizette Woodworth Reese, and many others"
53,,"whose work has enriched both periods, was fully represented also"
54,,"in `The Little Book of Modern Verse'; and it has seemed necessary,"
55,,"therefore keenly as I regret the necessity, which limits of space impose,"
56,,to omit the work of all poets who have been represented in both
57,,of my former collections.
58,,
59,,Indeed the period covered by the present volume has been so prolific that
60,,"it became necessary, if one would represent it with even approximate adequacy,"
61,,"to forego including many poets from `The Little Book of Modern Verse' itself,"
62,,and but twenty-eight are repeated from that collection.
63,,
64,,Even with these necessary eliminations in the interest of space
65,,"for newer poets, the general scheme of the series -- that of small,"
66,,"intimate volumes that shall be typical of the period, rather than exhaustive"
67,,-- has made it impossible to include all whose work I should otherwise
68,,have been glad to represent.
69,,
70,,"While I have not hesitated, where a poet's earlier work seemed"
71,,"finer and more characteristic than his later, to draw upon such earlier work,"
72,,in the main `The Second Book of Modern Verse' has been selected
73,,"from poetry published since 1913, the date of my first anthology."

317,,The Road not taken.  [Robert Frost]
318,,
319,,
320,,
321,,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"
322,,And sorry I could not travel both
323,,"And be one traveler, long I stood"
324,,And looked down one as far as I could
325,,To where it bent in the undergrowth;
326,,
327,,"Then took the other, as just as fair,"
328,,"And having perhaps the better claim,"
329,,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
330,,Though as for that the passing there
331,,"Had worn them really about the same,"
332,,
333,,And both that morning equally lay
334,,In leaves no step had trodden black.
335,,"Oh, I kept the first for another day!"
336,,"Yet knowing how way leads on to way,"
337,,I doubted if I should ever come back.
338,,
339,,I shall be telling this with a sigh
340,,Somewhere ages and ages hence:
341,,"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --"
342,,"I took the one less traveled by,"
343,,And that has made all the difference.

348,,Symbol.  [David Morton]
349,,
350,,
351,,
352,,"My faith is all a doubtful thing,"
353,,"Wove on a doubtful loom, --"
354,,"Until there comes, each showery spring,"
355,,A cherry-tree in bloom;
356,,And Christ who died upon a tree
357,,"That death had stricken bare,"
358,,"Comes beautifully back to me,"
359,,"In blossoms, everywhere."
360,,
361,,
362,,
363,,
364,,Spring.  [John Gould Fletcher]
365,,
366,,
367,,
368,,"At the first hour, it was as if one said, ""Arise."""
369,,"At the second hour, it was as if one said, ""Go forth."""
370,,And the winter constellations that are like patient ox-eyes
371,,Sank below the white horizon at the north.
372,,
373,,"At the third hour, it was as if one said, ""I thirst"";"
374,,"At the fourth hour, all the earth was still:"
375,,"Then the clouds suddenly swung over, stooped, and burst;"
376,,"And the rain flooded valley, plain and hill."
377,,
378,,"At the fifth hour, darkness took the throne;"
379,,"At the sixth hour, the earth shook and the wind cried;"
380,,"At the seventh hour, the hidden seed was sown;"
381,,"At the eighth hour, it gave up the ghost and died."
382,,
383,,"At the ninth hour, they sealed up the tomb;"
384,,And the earth was then silent for the space of three hours.
385,,"But at the twelfth hour, a single lily from the gloom"
386,,"Shot forth, and was followed by a whole host of flowers."
387,,
388,,
389,,
390,,
391,,"""There will come Soft Rain"".  [Sara Teasdale]"
392,,
393,,
394,,
395,,"There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,"
396,,And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
397,,
398,,"And frogs in the pools singing at night,"
399,,And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;
400,,
401,,Robins will wear their feathery fire
402,,Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire.
403,,
404,,"And not one will know of the war, not one"
405,,Will care at last when it is done.
406,,
407,,"Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,"
408,,If mankind perished utterly.
409,,
410,,"And Spring herself when she woke at dawn,"
411,,Would scarcely know that we were gone.
412,,
413,,
414,,
415,,
416,,Spring Song.  [William Griffith]
417,,
418,,
419,,
420,,Softly at dawn a whisper stole
421,,"Down from the Green House on the Hill,"
422,,Enchanting many a ghostly bole
423,,And wood-song with the ancient thrill.
424,,
425,,"Gossiping on the country-side,"
426,,"Spring and the wandering breezes say,"
427,,God has thrown Heaven open wide
428,,And let the thrushes out to-day.
429,,

432,,
433,,The Day before April.  [Mary Carolyn Davies]
434,,
435,,
436,,
437,,The day before April
438,,"Alone, alone,"
439,,I walked in the woods
440,,And I sat on a stone.
441,,
442,,I sat on a broad stone
443,,And sang to the birds.
444,,The tune was God's making
445,,But I made the words.
446,,
447,,
448,,
449,,
450,,Berkshires in April.  [Clement Wood]
451,,
452,,
453,,
454,,It is not Spring -- not yet --
455,,But at East Schaghticoke I saw an ivory birch
456,,Lifting a filmy red mantle of knotted buds
457,,Above the rain-washed whiteness of her arms.
458,,
459,,It is not Spring -- not yet --
460,,"But at Hoosick Falls I saw a robin strutting,"
461,,"Thin, still, and fidgety,"
462,,"Not like the puffed, complacent ball of feathers"
463,,That dawdles over the cidery Autumn loam.
464,,
465,,It is not Spring -- not yet --
466,,But up the stocky Pownal hills
467,,"Some springy shrub, a scarlet gash on the grayness,"
468,,"Climbs, flaming, over the melting snows."
469,,
470,,It is not Spring -- not yet --
471,,"But at Williamstown the willows are young and golden,"
472,,Their tall tips flinging the sun's rays back at him;
473,,"And as the sun drags over the Berkshire crests,"
474,,"The willows glow, the scarlet bushes burn,"
475,,"The high hill birches shine like purple plumes,"
476,,A royal headdress for the brow of Spring.
477,,"It is the doubtful, unquiet end of Winter,"
478,,And Spring is pulsing out of the wakening soil.
479,,
480,,
481,,
482,,
483,,"In Excelsis.  [Thomas S. Jones, Jr.]"
484,,
485,,
486,,
487,,Spring!
488,,"And all our valleys turning into green,"
489,,Remembering --
490,,As I remember!  So my heart turns glad
491,,For so much youth and joy -- this to have had
492,,When in my veins the tide of living fire
493,,Was at its flow;
494,,"This to know,"
495,,When now the miracle of young desire
496,,"Burns on the hills, and Spring's sweet choristers again"
497,,Chant from each tree and every bush aflame
498,,Love's wondrous name;
499,,"This under youth's glad reign,"
500,,With all the valleys turning into green --
501,,This to have heard and seen!
502,,
503,,And Song!
504,,Once to have known what every wakened bird
505,,Has heard;
506,,Once to have entered into that great harmony
507,,"Of love's creation, and to feel"
508,,The pulsing waves of wonder steal
509,,Through all my being; once to be
510,,In that same sea
511,,Of wakened joy that stirs in every tree
512,,And every bird; and then to sing --
513,,To sing aloud the endless Song of Spring!
514,,
515,,"Waiting, I turn to Thee,"
516,,"Expectant, humble, and on bended knee;"
517,,Youth's radiant fire
518,,Only to burn at Thy unknown desire --
519,,For this alone has Song been granted me.
520,,Upon Thy altar burn me at Thy will;
521,,All wonders fill
522,,"My cup, and it is Thine;"
523,,Life's precious wine
524,,For this alone:  for Thee.
525,,Yet never can be paid
526,,The debt long laid
527,,"Upon my heart, because my lips did press"
528,,In youth's glad Spring the Cup of Loveliness!
529,,
530,,
531,,
532,,
533,,Blue Squills.  [Sara Teasdale]
534,,
535,,
536,,
537,,How many million Aprils came
538,,Before I ever knew
539,,"How white a cherry bough could be,"
540,,"A bed of squills, how blue."
541,,
542,,And many a dancing April
543,,"When life is done with me,"
544,,Will lift the blue flame of the flower
545,,And the white flame of the tree.
546,,
547,,"Oh, burn me with your beauty, then,"
548,,"Oh, hurt me, tree and flower,"
549,,Lest in the end death try to take
550,,Even this glistening hour.
551,,
552,,"O shaken flowers, O shimmering trees,"
553,,"O sunlit white and blue,"
554,,"Wound me, that I through endless sleep"
555,,May bear the scar of you.
556,,
557,,

559,,
560,,Earth.  [John Hall Wheelock]
561,,
562,,
563,,
564,,"Grasshopper, your fairy song"
565,,And my poem alike belong
566,,To the dark and silent earth
567,,From which all poetry has birth;
568,,All we say and all we sing
569,,Is but as the murmuring
570,,Of that drowsy heart of hers
571,,When from her deep dream she stirs:
572,,"If we sorrow, or rejoice,"
573,,You and I are but her voice.
574,,
575,,Deftly does the dust express
576,,"In mind her hidden loveliness,"
577,,And from her cool silence stream
578,,The cricket's cry and Dante's dream;
579,,For the earth that breeds the trees
580,,"Breeds cities too, and symphonies."
581,,Equally her beauty flows
582,,"Into a savior, or a rose --"
583,,"Looks down in dream, and from above"
584,,Smiles at herself in Jesus' love.
585,,Christ's love and Homer's art
586,,Are but the workings of her heart;
587,,Through Leonardo's hand she seeks
588,,"Herself, and through Beethoven speaks"
589,,In holy thunderings around
590,,The awful message of the ground.
591,,
592,,The serene and humble mold
593,,Does in herself all selves enfold --
594,,"Kingdoms, destinies, and creeds,"
595,,"Great dreams, and dauntless deeds,"
596,,"Science that metes the firmament,"
597,,"The high, inflexible intent"
598,,Of one for many sacrificed --
599,,"Plato's brain, the heart of Christ:"
600,,"All love, all legend, and all lore"
601,,Are in the dust forevermore.
602,,
603,,Even as the growing grass
604,,"Up from the soil religions pass,"
605,,And the field that bears the rye
606,,Bears parables and prophecy.
607,,Out of the earth the poem grows
608,,"Like the lily, or the rose;"
609,,"And all man is, or yet may be,"
610,,Is but herself in agony
611,,Toiling up the steep ascent
612,,Toward the complete accomplishment
613,,"When all dust shall be, the whole"
614,,"Universe, one conscious soul."
615,,"Yea, the quiet and cool sod"
616,,Bears in her breast the dream of God.
617,,
618,,"If you would know what earth is, scan"
619,,"The intricate, proud heart of man,"
620,,"Which is the earth articulate,"
621,,"And learn how holy and how great,"
622,,How limitless and how profound
623,,Is the nature of the ground --
624,,How without terror or demur
625,,We may entrust ourselves to her
626,,"When we are wearied out, and lay"
627,,Our faces in the common clay.
628,,
629,,"For she is pity, she is love,"
630,,"All wisdom she, all thoughts that move"
631,,About her everlasting breast
632,,Till she gathers them to rest:
633,,"All tenderness of all the ages,"
634,,"Seraphic secrets of the sages,"
635,,"Vision and hope of all the seers,"
636,,"All prayer, all anguish, and all tears"
637,,"Are but the dust, that from her dream"
638,,"Awakes, and knows herself supreme --"
639,,Are but earth when she reveals
640,,All that her secret heart conceals
641,,"Down in the dark and silent loam,"
642,,"Which is ourselves, asleep, at home."
643,,
644,,"Yea, and this, my poem, too,"
645,,"Is part of her as dust and dew,"
646,,Wherein herself she doth declare
647,,"Through my lips, and say her prayer."

655,,
656,,I think that I shall never see
657,,A poem lovely as a tree.
658,,
659,,A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
660,,Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
661,,
662,,"A tree that looks at God all day,"
663,,And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
664,,
665,,A tree that may in summer wear
666,,A nest of robins in her hair;
667,,
668,,Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
669,,Who intimately lives with rain.
670,,
671,,"Poems are made by fools like me,"
672,,But only God can make a tree.

700,,The Spring blew trumpets of color;
701,,Her Green sang in my brain --
702,,I heard a blind man groping
703,,"""Tap -- tap"" with his cane;"
704,,
705,,I pitied him in his blindness;
706,,"But can I boast, ""I see""?"
707,,Perhaps there walks a spirit
708,,"Close by, who pities me, --"
709,,
710,,A spirit who hears me tapping
711,,The five-sensed cane of mind
712,,Amid such unguessed glories --
713,,That I am worse than blind.

722,,The first faint dawn was flushing up the skies
723,,"When, dreamland still bewildering mine eyes,"
724,,"I looked out to the oak that, winter-long,"
725,,-- a winter wild with war and woe and wrong --
726,,Beyond my casement had been void of song.
727,,
728,,"And lo! with golden buds the twigs were set,"
729,,Live buds that warbled like a rivulet
730,,Beneath a veil of willows.  Then I knew
731,,"Those tiny voices, clear as drops of dew,"
732,,"Those flying daffodils that fleck the blue,"
733,,
734,,"Those sparkling visitants from myrtle isles,"
735,,"Wee pilgrims of the sun, that measure miles"
736,,Innumerable over land and sea
737,,"With wings of shining inches.  Flakes of glee,"
738,,"They filled that dark old oak with jubilee,"
739,,
740,,Foretelling in delicious roundelays
741,,"Their dainty courtships on the dipping sprays,"
742,,"How they should fashion nests, mate helping mate,"
743,,Of milkweed flax and fern-down delicate
744,,To keep sky-tinted eggs inviolate.
745,,
746,,"Listening to those blithe notes, I slipped once more"
747,,"From lyric dawn through dreamland's open door,"
748,,"And there was God, Eternal Life that sings,"
749,,"Eternal joy, brooding all mortal things,"
750,,"A nest of stars, beneath untroubled wings."

765,,Woven of winter's browns
766,,Iris and pink azaleas
767,,Flutter their gaudy gowns.
768,,
769,,The dogwood spreads white meshes --
770,,So white and light and high --
771,,To catch the drifting sunlight
772,,Out of the cobalt sky.
773,,

793,,As I the April pathway trod
794,,Bound west for Willesden.
795,,
796,,At foot each tiny blade grew big
797,,"And taller stood to hear,"
798,,And every leaf on every twig
799,,Was like a little ear.
800,,
801,,"As I too paused, and both ways tried"
802,,"To catch the rippling rain, --"
803,,"So still, a hare kept at my side"
804,,"His tussock of disdain, --"
805,,
806,,"Behind me close I heard a step,"
807,,"A soft pit-pat surprise,"
808,,And looking round my eyes fell deep
809,,Into sweet other eyes;
810,,
811,,"The eyes like wells, where sun lies too,"
812,,"So clear and trustful brown,"
813,,Without a bubble warning you
814,,That here's a place to drown.
815,,
816,,"""How many miles?""  Her broken shoes"
817,,Had told of more than one.
818,,"She answered like a dreaming Muse,"
819,,"""I came from Islington."""
820,,
821,,"""So long a tramp?""  Two gentle nods,"
822,,"Then seemed to lift a wing,"
823,,"And words fell soft as willow-buds,"
824,,"""I came to find the Spring."""
825,,
826,,"A timid voice, yet not afraid"
827,,"In ways so sweet to roam,"
828,,As it with honey bees had played
829,,And could no more go home.
830,,
831,,"Her home! I saw the human lair,"
832,,"I heard the huckster's bawl,"
833,,I stifled with the thickened air
834,,Of bickering mart and stall.
835,,
836,,"Without a tuppence for a ride,"
837,,Her feet had set her free.
838,,"Her rags, that decency defied,"
839,,Seemed new with liberty.
840,,
841,,But she was frail.  Who would might note
842,,The trail of hungering
843,,That for an hour she had forgot
844,,In wonder of the Spring.
845,,
846,,So shriven by her joy she glowed
847,,It seemed a sin to chat.
848,,(A tea-shop snuggled off the road;
849,,Why did I think of that?)
850,,
851,,"Oh, frail, so frail! I could have wept, --"
852,,"But she was passing on,"
853,,"And I but muddled, ""You'll accept"
854,,"A penny for a bun?"""
855,,
856,,Then up her little throat a spray
857,,Of rose climbed for it must;
858,,A wilding lost till safe it lay
859,,Hid by her curls of rust;
860,,
861,,And I saw modesties at fence
862,,With pride that bore no name;
863,,So old it was she knew not whence
864,,It sudden woke and came;
865,,
866,,But that which shone of all most clear
867,,"Was startled, sadder thought"
868,,That I should give her back the fear
869,,Of life she had forgot.
870,,
871,,"And I blushed for the world we'd made,"
872,,"Putting God's hand aside,"
873,,Till for the want of sun and shade
874,,His little children died;
875,,
876,,And blushed that I who every year
877,,"With Spring went up and down,"
878,,Must greet a soul that ached for her
879,,"With ""penny for a bun!"""
880,,
881,,Struck as a thief in holy place
882,,"Whose sin upon him cries,"
883,,"I watched the flowers leave her face,"
884,,The song go from her eyes.
885,,
886,,"Then she, sweet heart, she saw my rout,"
887,,And of her charity
888,,A hand of grace put softly out
889,,And took the coin from me.
890,,
891,,"A red-cap sang in Bishop's wood,"
892,,A lark o'er Golder's lane;
893,,"But I, alone, still glooming stood,"
894,,And April plucked in vain;
895,,
896,,Till living words rang in my ears
897,,And sudden music played:
898,,~Out of such sacred thirst as hers
899,,The world shall be remade.~
900,,
901,,Afar she turned her head and smiled
902,,"As might have smiled the Spring,"
903,,And humble as a wondering child
904,,I watched her vanishing.

914,,"About the rush of faces in the town by day,"
915,,"But a light tan cow in a pale green mead,"
916,,"That is very beautiful, beautiful indeed . . ."
917,,And the soft March wind and the low March mist
918,,Are better than kisses in a dark street kissed . . .
919,,"The fragrance of the forest when it wakes at dawn,"
920,,"The fragrance of a trim green village lawn,"
921,,The hearing of the murmur of the rain at play --
922,,"These things are beautiful, beautiful as day!"
923,,And I shan't stand waiting for love or scorn
924,,When the feast is laid for a day new-born . . .
925,,"Oh, better let the little things I loved when little"
926,,Return when the heart finds the great things brittle;
927,,And better is a temple made of bark and thong
928,,Than a tall stone temple that may stand too long.

942,,"All of them, all, would I give for a new one."
943,,(Is there no seeker

989,,I know not by what road I came -- oh wonderful and fair!
990,,Only I know I ailed for thee and that thou wert not there.
991,,"Then suddenly Time's stalwart wall before thee did divide,"

994,,It is thy nearness makes thee seem so wonderful and far.

997,,"My need begets a shining world.  Lo, in thy light am I."

999,,All that I used to be is there and all I yet shall be.
1000,,"My laughter deepens in the air, my quiet in the tree."

1010,,That are so bounteous and mild and have not any care.
1011,,But kindest to me is the one I would most choose to be.
1012,,She is so beautiful and sheds such loving looks on me.
1013,,
1014,,She is so beautiful -- and lays her cheek against my own.
1015,,"Back -- in the world -- they all will say, ""How happy you have grown."""

1017,,"Though I be scarred with grief, I keep her kiss upon my brow."
1018,,
1019,,"All day, sweet land, I fight for thee outside the goodly wall,"

1162,IV,The bells of Oseney
1163,IV,"(Doucement, Austyn, Hautclere)"

1179,IV,
1180,IV,Vain is the chiming of forgotten bells
1181,IV,That the wind sways above a ruined shrine.
1182,IV,Vainer his voice in whom no longer dwells
1183,IV,Hunger that craves immortal Bread and Wine.
1184,IV,
1185,IV,Light songs we breathe that perish with our breath
1186,IV,Out of our lips that have not kissed the rod.
1187,IV,They shall not live who have not tasted death.
1188,IV,They only sing who are struck dumb by God.

1197,IV,"I cannot think nor reason,"
1198,IV,I only know he came
1199,IV,With hands and feet of healing
1200,IV,And wild heart all aflame.
1201,IV,
1202,IV,With eyes that dimmed and softened
1203,IV,"At all the things he saw,"
1204,IV,And in his pillared singing
1205,IV,I read the marching Law.
1206,IV,
1207,IV,"I only know he loves me,"
1208,IV,Enfolds and understands --
1209,IV,"And oh, his heart that holds me,"
1210,IV,"And oh, his certain hands!"

1216,IV,
1217,IV,
1218,IV,
1219,IV,Because on the branch that is tapping my pane
1220,IV,"A sun-wakened leaf-bud, uncurled,"
1221,IV,"Is bursting its rusty brown sheathing in twain,"
1222,IV,I know there is Spring in the world.
1223,IV,
1224,IV,Because through the sky-patch whose azure and white
1225,IV,"My window frames all the day long,"
1226,IV,"A yellow-bird dips for an instant of flight,"
1227,IV,I know there is Song.
1228,IV,
1229,IV,Because even here in this Mansion of Woe
1230,IV,"Where creep the dull hours, leaden-shod,"
1231,IV,"Compassion and Tenderness aid me, I know"
1232,IV,There is God.

1238,IV,
1239,IV,
1240,IV,
1241,IV,That overnight a rose could come
1242,IV,"I one time did believe,"
1243,IV,"For when the fairies live with one,"
1244,IV,They wilfully deceive.
1245,IV,But now I know this perfect thing
1246,IV,Under the frozen sod
1247,IV,In cold and storm grew patiently
1248,IV,Obedient to God.
1249,IV,"My wonder grows, since knowledge came"
1250,IV,Old fancies to dismiss;
1251,IV,And courage comes.  Was not the rose
1252,IV,A winter doing this?
1253,IV,"Nor did it know, the weary while,"
1254,IV,What color and perfume
1255,IV,With this completed loveliness
1256,IV,Lay in that earthly tomb.
1257,IV,"So maybe I, who cannot see"
1258,IV,"What God wills not to show,"
1259,IV,"May, some day, bear a rose for Him"
1260,IV,It took my life to grow.

1268,IV,
1269,IV,Great god whom I shall carve from this gray stone
1270,IV,"Wherein thou liest, hid to all but me,"
1271,IV,Grant thou that when my art hath made thee known
1272,IV,"And others bow, I shall not worship thee."
1273,IV,"But, as I pray thee now, then let me pray"
1274,IV,"Some greater god, -- like thee to be conceived"
1275,IV,"Within my soul, -- for strength to turn away"
1276,IV,"From his new altar, when, that task achieved,"
1277,IV,"He, too, stands manifest.  Yea, let me yearn"
1278,IV,From dream to grander dream!  Let me not rest
1279,IV,Content at any goal!  Still bid me spurn
1280,IV,"Each transient triumph on the Eternal Quest,"
1281,IV,Abjuring godlings whom my hand hath made

1290,IV,
1291,IV,What sudden bugle calls us in the night
1292,IV,And wakes us from a dream that we had shaped;
1293,IV,Flinging us sharply up against a fight
1294,IV,We thought we had escaped.
1295,IV,
1296,IV,"It is no easy waking, and we win"
1297,IV,No final peace; our victories are few.
1298,IV,But still imperative forces pull us in
1299,IV,And sweep us somehow through.
1300,IV,
1301,IV,Summoned by a supreme and confident power
1302,IV,"That wakes our sleeping courage like a blow,"
1303,IV,"We rise, half-shaken, to the challenging hour,"
1304,IV,And answer it -- and go.

1318,IV,How shall ye wear the yoke that must be worn?)
1319,IV,
1320,IV,"Look thou, my son, what wisdom comes to thee!"
1321,IV,"(But oh, that singing mouth, those radiant eyes!"

1333,IV,The Falconer of God.  [William Rose Benet]
1334,IV,
1335,IV,
1336,IV,
1337,IV,I flung my soul to the air like a falcon flying.
1338,IV,"I said, ""Wait on, wait on, while I ride below!"
1339,IV,I shall start a heron soon
1340,IV,In the marsh beneath the moon --
1341,IV,"A strange white heron rising with silver on its wings,"
1342,IV,Rising and crying
1343,IV,"Wordless, wondrous things;"
1344,IV,"The secret of the stars, of the world's heart-strings,"
1345,IV,The answer to their woe.
1346,IV,"Then stoop thou upon him, and grip and hold him so!"""
1347,IV,
1348,IV,My wild soul waited on as falcons hover.
1349,IV,I beat the reedy fens as I trampled past.
1350,IV,I heard the mournful loon
1351,IV,In the marsh beneath the moon.
1352,IV,And then -- with feathery thunder -- the bird of my desire
1353,IV,Broke from the cover
1354,IV,Flashing silver fire.
1355,IV,High up among the stars I saw his pinions spire.
1356,IV,The pale clouds gazed aghast
1357,IV,"As my falcon stoopt upon him, and gript and held him fast."
1358,IV,
1359,IV,My soul dropt through the air -- with heavenly plunder? --
1360,IV,Gripping the dazzling bird my dreaming knew?
1361,IV,"Nay! but a piteous freight,"
1362,IV,A dark and heavy weight
1363,IV,"Despoiled of silver plumage, its voice forever stilled, --"
1364,IV,All of the wonder
1365,IV,Gone that ever filled
1366,IV,"Its guise with glory.  Oh, bird that I have killed,"
1367,IV,How brilliantly you flew
1368,IV,Across my rapturous vision when first I dreamed of you!
1369,IV,
1370,IV,"Yet I fling my soul on high with new endeavor,"
1371,IV,And I ride the world below with a joyful mind.
1372,IV,~I shall start a heron soon
1373,IV,In the marsh beneath the moon --
1374,IV,A wondrous silver heron its inner darkness fledges!~
1375,IV,I beat forever
1376,IV,The fens and the sedges.
1377,IV,"The pledge is still the same -- for all disastrous pledges,"
1378,IV,All hopes resigned!
1379,IV,My soul still flies above me for the quarry it shall find.

1385,IV,
1386,IV,
1387,IV,
1388,IV,What though the moon should come
1389,IV,"With a blinding glow,"
1390,IV,And the stars have a game
1391,IV,"On the wood's edge,"
1392,IV,A man would have to still
1393,IV,"Cut and weed and sow,"
1394,IV,And lay a white line
1395,IV,When he plants a hedge.
1396,IV,
1397,IV,What though God
1398,IV,With a great sound of rain
1399,IV,Came to talk of violets
1400,IV,"And things people do,"
1401,IV,I would have to labor
1402,IV,And dig with my brain
1403,IV,Still to get a truth
1404,IV,Out of all words new.

1410,IV,
1411,IV,
1412,IV,
1413,IV,What waspish whim of Fate
1414,IV,Was this that bade you here
1415,IV,"Hold dim, unhonored state,"
1416,IV,No single courtier near?
1417,IV,
1418,IV,"Is there, of all who pass,"
1419,IV,"No choice, discerning few"
1420,IV,To poise the ribboned glass
1421,IV,And gaze enwrapt on you?
1422,IV,
1423,IV,Sword-soul that from its sheath
1424,IV,"Laughed leaping to the fray,"
1425,IV,How calmly underneath
1426,IV,Goes Brooklyn on her way!
1427,IV,
1428,IV,Quite heedless of that smile --
1429,IV,"Half-devil and half-god,"
1430,IV,"Your quite unequalled style,"
1431,IV,The airy heights you trod.
1432,IV,
1433,IV,"Ah, could you from earth's breast"
1434,IV,"Come back to take the air,"
1435,IV,What matter here for jest
1436,IV,Most exquisite and rare!
1437,IV,
1438,IV,"But since you may not come,"
1439,IV,"Since silence holds you fast,"
1440,IV,Since all your quips are dumb
1441,IV,And all your laughter past --
1442,IV,
1443,IV,"I give you mine instead,"
1444,IV,And something with it too
1445,IV,That Brooklyn leaves unsaid --
1446,IV,The world's fine homage due.
1447,IV,
1448,IV,"Ah, Prince, you smile again --"
1449,IV,"""My faith, the court is small!"""
1450,IV,"I know, dear James -- but then"
1451,IV,It's I or none at all!

1456,IV,Flammonde.  [Edwin Arlington Robinson]
1457,IV,
1458,IV,
1459,IV,
1460,IV,"The man Flammonde, from God knows where,"
1461,IV,"With firm address and foreign air,"
1462,IV,With news of nations in his talk
1463,IV,"And something royal in his walk,"
1464,IV,"With glint of iron in his eyes,"
1465,IV,"But never doubt, nor yet surprise,"
1466,IV,"Appeared, and stayed, and held his head"
1467,IV,As one by kings accredited.
1468,IV,
1469,IV,"Erect, with his alert repose"
1470,IV,"About him, and about his clothes,"
1471,IV,He pictured all tradition hears
1472,IV,Of what we owe to fifty years.
1473,IV,His cleansing heritage of taste
1474,IV,Paraded neither want nor waste;
1475,IV,And what he needed for his fee
1476,IV,"To live, he borrowed graciously."
1477,IV,
1478,IV,"He never told us what he was,"
1479,IV,"Or what mischance, or other cause,"
1480,IV,Had banished him from better days
1481,IV,To play the Prince of Castaways.
1482,IV,Meanwhile he played surpassing well
1483,IV,"A part, for most, unplayable;"
1484,IV,"In fine, one pauses, half afraid"
1485,IV,To say for certain that he played.
1486,IV,
1487,IV,"For that, one may as well forego"
1488,IV,Conviction as to yes or no;
1489,IV,Nor can I say just how intense
1490,IV,Would then have been the difference
1491,IV,"To several, who, having striven"
1492,IV,"In vain to get what he was given,"
1493,IV,Would see the stranger taken on
1494,IV,By friends not easy to be won.
1495,IV,
1496,IV,"Moreover, many a malcontent"
1497,IV,He soothed and found munificent;
1498,IV,His courtesy beguiled and foiled
1499,IV,Suspicion that his years were soiled;
1500,IV,"His mien distinguished any crowd,"
1501,IV,His credit strengthened when he bowed;
1502,IV,"And women, young and old, were fond"
1503,IV,Of looking at the man Flammonde.
1504,IV,
1505,IV,There was a woman in our town
1506,IV,On whom the fashion was to frown;
1507,IV,But while our talk renewed the tinge
1508,IV,"Of a long-faded scarlet fringe,"
1509,IV,"The man Flammonde saw none of that,"
1510,IV,And what he saw we wondered at --
1511,IV,"That none of us, in her distress,"
1512,IV,Could hide or find our littleness.
1513,IV,
1514,IV,There was a boy that all agreed
1515,IV,Had shut within him the rare seed
1516,IV,"Of learning.  We could understand,"
1517,IV,But none of us could lift a hand.
1518,IV,"The man Flammonde appraised the youth,"
1519,IV,And told a few of us the truth;
1520,IV,"And thereby, for a little gold,"
1521,IV,A flowered future was unrolled.
1522,IV,
1523,IV,There were two citizens who fought
1524,IV,"For years and years, and over nought;"
1525,IV,"They made life awkward for their friends,"
1526,IV,And shortened their own dividends.
1527,IV,The man Flammonde said what was wrong
1528,IV,"Should be made right, nor was it long"
1529,IV,"Before they were again in line,"
1530,IV,And had each other in to dine.
1531,IV,
1532,IV,And these I mention are but four
1533,IV,Of many out of many more.
1534,IV,So much for them.  But what of him --
1535,IV,So firm in every look and limb?
1536,IV,What small satanic sort of kink
1537,IV,Was in his brain?  What broken link
1538,IV,Withheld him from the destinies
1539,IV,That came so near to being his?
1540,IV,
1541,IV,"What was he, when we came to sift"
1542,IV,"His meaning, and to note the drift"
1543,IV,Of incommunicable ways
1544,IV,That make us ponder while we praise?
1545,IV,Why was it that his charm revealed
1546,IV,Somehow the surface of a shield?
1547,IV,What was it that we never caught?
1548,IV,"What was he, and what was he not?"
1549,IV,
1550,IV,How much it was of him we met
1551,IV,We cannot ever know; nor yet
1552,IV,Shall all he gave us quite atone
1553,IV,"For what was his, and his alone;"
1554,IV,"Nor need we now, since he knew best,"
1555,IV,Nourish an ethical unrest:
1556,IV,Rarely at once will nature give
1557,IV,The power to be Flammonde and live.
1558,IV,
1559,IV,We cannot know how much we learn
1560,IV,"From those who never will return,"
1561,IV,Until a flash of unforeseen
1562,IV,Remembrance falls on what has been.
1563,IV,We've each a darkening hill to climb;
1564,IV,"And this is why, from time to time"
1565,IV,"In Tilbury Town, we look beyond"
1566,IV,Horizons for the man Flammonde.

1571,IV,The Chinese Nightingale.  [Vachel Lindsay]
1572,IV,
1573,IV,
1574,IV,
1575,IV,"""How, how,"" he said.  ""Friend Chang,"" I said,"
1576,IV,"""San Francisco sleeps as the dead --"
1577,IV,"Ended license, lust and play:"
1578,IV,Why do you iron the night away?
1579,IV,"Your big clock speaks with a deadly sound,"
1580,IV,With a tick and a wail till dawn comes round.
1581,IV,"While the monster shadows glower and creep,"
1582,IV,"What can be better for man than sleep?"""
1583,IV,
1584,IV,"""I will tell you a secret,"" Chang replied;"
1585,IV,"""My breast with vision is satisfied,"
1586,IV,"And I see green trees and fluttering wings,"
1587,IV,"And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings."""
1588,IV,Then he lit five fire-crackers in a pan.
1589,IV,"""Pop, pop,"" said the fire-crackers, ""cra-cra-crack."""
1590,IV,He lit a joss stick long and black.
1591,IV,Then the proud gray joss in the corner stirred;
1592,IV,"On his wrist appeared a gray small bird,"
1593,IV,And this was the song of the gray small bird:
1594,IV,"""Where is the princess, loved forever,"
1595,IV,"Who made Chang first of the kings of men?"""
1596,IV,
1597,IV,And the joss in the corner stirred again;
1598,IV,"And the carved dog, curled in his arms, awoke,"
1599,IV,Barked forth a smoke-cloud that whirled and broke.
1600,IV,"It piled in a maze round the ironing-place,"
1601,IV,And there on the snowy table wide
1602,IV,"Stood a Chinese lady of high degree,"
1603,IV,"With a scornful, witching, tea-rose face . . ."
1604,IV,"Yet she put away all form and pride,"
1605,IV,And laid her glimmering veil aside
1606,IV,With a childlike smile for Chang and for me.
1607,IV,
1608,IV,"The walls fell back, night was aflower,"
1609,IV,"The table gleamed in a moonlit bower,"
1610,IV,"While Chang, with a countenance carved of stone,"
1611,IV,"Ironed and ironed, all alone."
1612,IV,And thus she sang to the busy man Chang:
1613,IV,"""Have you forgotten . . ."
1614,IV,"Deep in the ages, long, long ago,"
1615,IV,"I was your sweetheart, there on the sand --"
1616,IV,Storm-worn beach of the Chinese land?
1617,IV,We sold our grain in the peacock town
1618,IV,Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown --
1619,IV,Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown . . .
1620,IV,
1621,IV,"""When all the world was drinking blood"
1622,IV,From the skulls of men and bulls
1623,IV,"And all the world had swords and clubs of stone,"
1624,IV,"We drank our tea in China beneath the sacred spice-trees,"
1625,IV,And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan.
1626,IV,"And this gray bird, in Love's first spring,"
1627,IV,"With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing,"
1628,IV,Captured the world with his carolling.
1629,IV,"Do you remember, ages after,"
1630,IV,At last the world we were born to own?
1631,IV,You were the heir of the yellow throne --
1632,IV,The world was the field of the Chinese man
1633,IV,And we were the pride of the Sons of Han?
1634,IV,"We copied deep books and we carved in jade,"
1635,IV,"And wove blue silks in the mulberry shade . . ."""
1636,IV,
1637,IV,"""I remember, I remember"
1638,IV,"That Spring came on forever,"
1639,IV,"That Spring came on forever,"""
1640,IV,Said the Chinese nightingale.
1641,IV,
1642,IV,"My heart was filled with marvel and dream,"
1643,IV,"Though I saw the western street-lamps gleam,"
1644,IV,"Though dawn was bringing the western day,"
1645,IV,Though Chang was a laundryman ironing away . . .
1646,IV,"Mingled there with the streets and alleys,"
1647,IV,"The railroad-yard and the clock-tower bright,"
1648,IV,Demon clouds crossed ancient valleys;
1649,IV,Across wide lotus-ponds of light
1650,IV,I marked a giant firefly's flight.
1651,IV,
1652,IV,"And the lady, rosy-red,"
1653,IV,"Flourished her fan, her shimmering fan,"
1654,IV,"Stretched her hand toward Chang, and said:"
1655,IV,"""Do you remember,"
1656,IV,"Ages after,"
1657,IV,Our palace of heart-red stone?
1658,IV,Do you remember
1659,IV,The little doll-faced children
1660,IV,"With their lanterns full of moon-fire,"
1661,IV,That came from all the empire
1662,IV,Honoring the throne? --
1663,IV,The loveliest fete and carnival
1664,IV,Our world had ever known?
1665,IV,The sages sat about us
1666,IV,"With their heads bowed in their beards,"
1667,IV,With proper meditation on the sight.
1668,IV,Confucius was not born;
1669,IV,We lived in those great days
1670,IV,Confucius later said were lived aright . . .
1671,IV,"And this gray bird, on that day of spring,"
1672,IV,"With a bright-bronze breast, and a bronze-brown wing,"
1673,IV,Captured the world with his carolling.
1674,IV,Late at night his tune was spent.
1675,IV,"Peasants,"
1676,IV,"Sages,"
1677,IV,"Children,"
1678,IV,"Homeward went,"
1679,IV,And then the bronze bird sang for you and me.
1680,IV,We walked alone.  Our hearts were high and free.
1681,IV,"I had a silvery name, I had a silvery name,"
1682,IV,I had a silvery name -- do you remember
1683,IV,"The name you cried beside the tumbling sea?"""
1684,IV,
1685,IV,Chang turned not to the lady slim --
1686,IV,"He bent to his work, ironing away;"
1687,IV,"But she was arch, and knowing and glowing,"
1688,IV,And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him.
1689,IV,
1690,IV,"""Darling . . . darling . . . darling . . . darling . . ."""
1691,IV,Said the Chinese nightingale.
1692,IV,
1693,IV,"The great gray joss on a rustic shelf,"
1694,IV,"Rakish and shrewd, with his collar awry,"
1695,IV,"Sang impolitely, as though by himself,"
1696,IV,Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale's cry:
1697,IV,"""Back through a hundred, hundred years"
1698,IV,"Hear the waves as they climb the piers,"
1699,IV,"Hear the howl of the silver seas,"
1700,IV,Hear the thunder.
1701,IV,Hear the gongs of holy China
1702,IV,How the waves and tunes combine
1703,IV,"In a rhythmic clashing wonder,"
1704,IV,Incantation old and fine:
1705,IV,"`Dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons,"
1706,IV,"Red fire-crackers, and green fire-crackers,"
1707,IV,"And dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons.'"""
1708,IV,
1709,IV,"Then the lady, rosy-red,"
1710,IV,Turned to her lover Chang and said:
1711,IV,"""Dare you forget that turquoise dawn,"
1712,IV,"When we stood in our mist-hung velvet lawn,"
1713,IV,And worked a spell this great joss taught
1714,IV,Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught?
1715,IV,From the flag high over our palace home
1716,IV,He flew to our feet in rainbow-foam --
1717,IV,A king of beauty and tempest and thunder
1718,IV,Panting to tear our sorrows asunder:
1719,IV,A dragon of fair adventure and wonder.
1720,IV,We mounted the back of that royal slave
1721,IV,With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave.
1722,IV,"We swam down the shore to the dragon-mountains,"
1723,IV,We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains.
1724,IV,To our secret ivory house we were borne.
1725,IV,We looked down the wonderful wing-filled regions
1726,IV,Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions.
1727,IV,Right by my breast the nightingale sang;
1728,IV,The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist
1729,IV,That we this hour regain --
1730,IV,Song-fire for the brain.
1731,IV,"When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed,"
1732,IV,"When you cried for your heart's new pain,"
1733,IV,"What was my name in the dragon-mist,"
1734,IV,"In the rings of rainbowed rain?"""
1735,IV,
1736,IV,"""Sorrow and love, glory and love,"""
1737,IV,Said the Chinese nightingale.
1738,IV,"""Sorrow and love, glory and love,"""
1739,IV,Said the Chinese nightingale.
1740,IV,
1741,IV,And now the joss broke in with his song:
1742,IV,"""Dying ember, bird of Chang,"
1743,IV,"Soul of Chang, do you remember? --"
1744,IV,Ere you returned to the shining harbor
1745,IV,There were pirates by ten thousand
1746,IV,Descended on the town
1747,IV,"In vessels mountain-high and red and brown,"
1748,IV,Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies.
1749,IV,On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes.
1750,IV,But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest;
1751,IV,I stood upon the sand;
1752,IV,With lifted hand I looked upon them
1753,IV,"And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes,"
1754,IV,And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again.
1755,IV,"Deep, deep below the bay, the sea-weed and the spray,"
1756,IV,"Embalmed in amber every pirate lies,"
1757,IV,"Embalmed in amber every pirate lies."""
1758,IV,
1759,IV,Then this did the noble lady say:
1760,IV,"""Bird, do you dream of our home-coming day"
1761,IV,When you flew like a courier on before
1762,IV,"From the dragon-peak to our palace-door,"
1763,IV,And we drove the steed in your singing path --
1764,IV,The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath:
1765,IV,"And found our city all aglow,"
1766,IV,And knighted this joss that decked it so?
1767,IV,There were golden fishes in the purple river
1768,IV,And silver fishes and rainbow fishes.
1769,IV,"There were golden junks in the laughing river,"
1770,IV,And silver junks and rainbow junks:
1771,IV,"There were golden lilies by the bay and river,"
1772,IV,"And silver lilies and tiger-lilies,"
1773,IV,And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town
1774,IV,By the black-lacquer gate
1775,IV,Where walked in state
1776,IV,The kind king Chang
1777,IV,And his sweetheart mate . . .
1778,IV,With his flag-born dragon
1779,IV,"And his crown of pearl . . . and . . . jade,"
1780,IV,"And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade,"
1781,IV,"And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown,"
1782,IV,And priests who bowed them down to your song --
1783,IV,"By the city called Han, the peacock town,"
1784,IV,"By the city called Han, the nightingale town,"
1785,IV,"The nightingale town."""
1786,IV,
1787,IV,"Then sang the bird, so strangely gay,"
1788,IV,"Fluttering, fluttering, ghostly and gray,"
1789,IV,"A vague, unravelling, final tune,"
1790,IV,Like a long unwinding silk cocoon;
1791,IV,Sang as though for the soul of him
1792,IV,Who ironed away in that bower dim: --
1793,IV,"""I have forgotten"
1794,IV,"Your dragons great,"
1795,IV,Merry and mad and friendly and bold.
1796,IV,Dim is your proud lost palace-gate.
1797,IV,I vaguely know
1798,IV,"There were heroes of old,"
1799,IV,"Troubles more than the heart could hold,"
1800,IV,There were wolves in the woods
1801,IV,"Yet lambs in the fold,"
1802,IV,Nests in the top of the almond tree . . .
1803,IV,The evergreen tree . . . and the mulberry tree . . .
1804,IV,"Life and hurry and joy forgotten,"
1805,IV,Years on years I but half-remember . . .
1806,IV,"Man is a torch, then ashes soon,"
1807,IV,"May and June, then dead December,"
1808,IV,"Dead December, then again June."
1809,IV,Who shall end my dream's confusion?
1810,IV,"Life is a loom, weaving illusion . . ."
1811,IV,"I remember, I remember"
1812,IV,There were ghostly veils and laces . . .
1813,IV,In the shadowy bowery places . . .
1814,IV,With lovers' ardent faces
1815,IV,"Bending to one another,"
1816,IV,Speaking each his part.
1817,IV,They infinitely echo
1818,IV,In the red cave of my heart.
1819,IV,"`Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart,'"
1820,IV,They said to one another.
1821,IV,"They spoke, I think, of perils past."
1822,IV,"They spoke, I think, of peace at last."
1823,IV,One thing I remember:
1824,IV,"Spring came on forever,"
1825,IV,"Spring came on forever,"""

1840,IV,"Come with arms outstretched to take me,"
1841,IV,Come with lips that long to cling.
1842,IV,
1843,IV,"Come, for life is a frail moth flying,"
1844,IV,"Caught in the web of the years that pass,"
1845,IV,"And soon we two, so warm and eager,"

1892,IV,
1893,IV,"Oh, I could give him weeping,"

1929,IV,And I begged the little leaves to lean
1930,IV,Low and together for a safe screen;

1935,IV,"""And O, I know that I shall return,"
1936,IV,But let me lie first mid the unfeeling fern.

1954,IV,
1955,IV,Your eyes and the valley are memories.
1956,IV,Your eyes fire and the valley a bowl.
1957,IV,It was here a moonrise crept over the timberline.
1958,IV,It was here we turned the coffee cups upside down.
1959,IV,And your eyes and the moon swept the valley.
1960,IV,
1961,IV,I will see you again to-morrow.
1962,IV,I will see you again in a million years.
1963,IV,I will never know your dark eyes again.
1964,IV,These are three ghosts I keep.
1965,IV,These are three sumach-red dogs I run with.
1966,IV,
1967,IV,All of it wraps and knots to a riddle:
1968,IV,"I have the moon, the timberline, and you."
1969,IV,All three are gone -- and I keep all three.

1975,IV,
1976,IV,
1977,IV,
1978,IV,O'er Carmel fields in the springtime the sea-gulls follow the plow.
1979,IV,"White, white wings on the blue above!"
1980,IV,"White were your brow and breast, O Love!"
1981,IV,But I cannot see you now.
1982,IV,Tireless ever the Mission swallow
1983,IV,Dips to meadow and poppied hollow;
1984,IV,"Well for her mate that he can follow,"
1985,IV,As the buds are on the bough.
1986,IV,
1987,IV,By the woods and waters of Carmel the lark is glad in the sun.
1988,IV,Harrow! Harrow! Music of God!
1989,IV,Near to your nest her feet have trod
1990,IV,Whose journeyings are done.
1991,IV,"Sing, O lover! I cannot sing."
1992,IV,Wild and sad are the thoughts you bring.
1993,IV,"Well for you are the skies of spring,"
1994,IV,And to me all skies are one.
1995,IV,
1996,IV,In the beautiful woods of Carmel an iris bends to the wind.
1997,IV,O thou far-off and sorrowful flower!
1998,IV,Rose that I found in a tragic hour!
1999,IV,Rose that I shall not find!
2000,IV,"Petals that fell so soft and slowly,"
2001,IV,"Fragrant snows on the grasses lowly,"
2002,IV,Gathered now would I call you holy
2003,IV,Ever to eyes once blind.
2004,IV,
2005,IV,In the pine-sweet valley of Carmel the cream-cups scatter in foam.
2006,IV,Azures of early lupin there!
2007,IV,Now the wild lilac floods the air
2008,IV,Like a broken honey-comb.
2009,IV,So could the flowers of Paradise
2010,IV,Pour their souls to the morning skies;
2011,IV,So like a ghost your fragrance lies
2012,IV,On the path that once led home.
2013,IV,
2014,IV,On the emerald hills of Carmel the spring and winter have met.
2015,IV,Here I find in a gentled spot
2016,IV,"The frost of the wild forget-me-not,"
2017,IV,And -- I cannot forget.
2018,IV,Heart once light as the floating feather
2019,IV,"Borne aloft in the sunny weather,"
2020,IV,Spring and winter have come together --
2021,IV,Shall you and she meet yet?
2022,IV,
2023,IV,On the rocks and beaches of Carmel the surf is mighty to-day.
2024,IV,Breaker and lifting billow call
2025,IV,"To the high, blue Silence over all"
2026,IV,With the word no heart can say.
2027,IV,"Time-to-be, shall I hear it ever?"
2028,IV,"Time-that-is, with the hands that sever,"
2029,IV,"Cry all words but the dreadful ""Never""!"

2041,IV,"Now that I am without you, all is desolate;"
2042,IV,All that was once so beautiful is dead.
2043,IV,
2044,IV,"Your hands once touched this table and this silver,"
2045,IV,And I have seen your fingers hold this glass.
2046,IV,"These things do not remember you, beloved, --"
2047,IV,And yet your touch upon them will not pass.
2048,IV,
2049,IV,"For it was in my heart you moved among them,"
2050,IV,And blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;

2063,IV,"Within their shelter is no space for fear,"
2064,IV,Only the wonder that such things are true.
2065,IV,
2066,IV,The thought of you is like the dusk at sea --
2067,IV,"Space and wide freedom and old shores left far,"
2068,IV,The shelter of a lone immensity
2069,IV,Sealed by the sunset and the evening star.

2082,IV,"They have remembered islands in the dawn,"
2083,IV,"And windy capes that tried their slender spars,"
2084,IV,"And tortuous channels where their keels have gone,"
2085,IV,And calm blue nights of stillness and the stars.
2086,IV,
2087,IV,"Ah, never think that ships forget a shore,"
2088,IV,"Or bitter seas, or winds that made them wise;"
2089,IV,"There is a dream upon them, evermore; --"
2090,IV,And there be some who say that sunk ships rise

2105,IV,
2106,IV,"So much do I love wandering,"

2169,IV,A Lynmouth Widow.  [Amelia Josephine Burr]
2170,IV,
2171,IV,
2172,IV,
2173,IV,"He was straight and strong, and his eyes were blue"
2174,IV,"As the summer meeting of sky and sea,"
2175,IV,And the ruddy cliffs had a colder hue
2176,IV,Than flushed his cheek when he married me.
2177,IV,
2178,IV,"We passed the porch where the swallows breed,"
2179,IV,"We left the little brown church behind,"
2180,IV,"And I leaned on his arm, though I had no need,"
2181,IV,Only to feel him so strong and kind.
2182,IV,
2183,IV,One thing I never can quite forget;
2184,IV,It grips my throat when I try to pray --
2185,IV,The keen salt smell of a drying net
2186,IV,That hung on the churchyard wall that day.
2187,IV,
2188,IV,"He would have taken a long, long grave --"
2189,IV,"A long, long grave, for he stood so tall . . ."
2190,IV,"Oh, God, the crash of a breaking wave,"
2191,IV,And the smell of the nets on the churchyard wall!

2197,IV,
2198,IV,
2199,IV,
2200,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, what do you cover?"
2201,IV,"Sad folk, bad folk, and many a glowing lover;"
2202,IV,"Wise people, simple people, children of despair --"
2203,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, hiding pain and care."
2204,IV,
2205,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, O what sin you're knowing,"
2206,IV,While above you in the sky the white clouds are blowing;
2207,IV,"While beneath you, agony and dolor and grim strife"
2208,IV,"Fight the olden battle, the olden war of Life."
2209,IV,
2210,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, cover up their shame --"
2211,IV,"Wretched souls, prisoned souls too piteous to name;"
2212,IV,Man himself hath built you all to hide away the stars --
2213,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, you hide ten million scars."
2214,IV,
2215,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, well I know you cover"
2216,IV,Many solemn tragedies and many a lonely lover;
2217,IV,"But ah, you hide the good that lives in the throbbing city --"
2218,IV,"Patient wives, and tenderness, forgiveness, faith, and pity."
2219,IV,
2220,IV,"Roof-tops, roof-tops, this is what I wonder:"
2221,IV,"You are thick as poisonous plants, thick the people under;"
2222,IV,"Yet roofless, and homeless, and shelterless they roam,"

2229,IV,
2230,IV,
2231,IV,
2232,IV,Down by the railroad in a green valley
2233,IV,"By dancing water, there he stayed awhile"
2234,IV,"Singing, and three men with him, listeners,"
2235,IV,"All tramps, all homeless reapers of the wind,"
2236,IV,Motionless now and while the song went on
2237,IV,Transfigured into mages thronged with visions;
2238,IV,There with the late light of the sunset on them
2239,IV,And on clear water spinning from a spring
2240,IV,"Through little cones of sand dancing and fading,"
2241,IV,Close beside pine woods where a hermit thrush
2242,IV,"Cast, when love dazzled him, shadows of music"
2243,IV,"That lengthened, fluting, through the singer's pauses"
2244,IV,While the sure earth rolled eastward bringing stars
2245,IV,Over the singer and the men that listened
2246,IV,"There by the roadside, understanding all."
2247,IV,
2248,IV,A train went by but nothing seemed to be changed.
2249,IV,Some eye at a car window must have flashed
2250,IV,"From the plush world inside the glassy Pullman,"
2251,IV,"Carelessly bearing off the scene forever,"
2252,IV,"With idle wonder what the men were doing,"
2253,IV,Seeing they were so strangely fixed and seeing
2254,IV,Torn papers from their smeary dreary meal
2255,IV,Spread on the ground with old tomato cans
2256,IV,"Muddy with dregs of lukewarm chicory,"
2257,IV,Neglected while they listened to the song.
2258,IV,"And while he sang the singer's face was lifted,"
2259,IV,And the sky shook down a soft light upon him
2260,IV,Out of its branches where like fruits there were
2261,IV,"Many beautiful stars and planets moving,"
2262,IV,"With lands upon them, rising from their seas,"
2263,IV,"Glorious lands with glittering sands upon them,"
2264,IV,"With soils of gold and magic mould for seeding,"
2265,IV,The shining loam of lands afoam with gardens
2266,IV,On mightier stars with giant rains and suns
2267,IV,There in the heavens; but on none of all
2268,IV,Was there ground better than he stood upon:
2269,IV,There was no world there in the sky above him
2270,IV,Deeper in promise than the earth beneath him
2271,IV,Whose dust had flowered up in him the singer
2272,IV,And three men understanding every word.
2273,IV,
2274,IV,
2275,IV,The Tramp Sings:
2276,IV,
2277,IV,"I will sing, I will go, and never ask me ""Why?"""
2278,IV,I was born a rover and a passer-by.
2279,IV,
2280,IV,"I seem to myself like water and sky,"
2281,IV,A river and a rover and a passer-by.
2282,IV,
2283,IV,But in the winter three years back
2284,IV,"We lit us a night fire by the track,"
2285,IV,
2286,IV,And the snow came up and the fire it flew
2287,IV,And we couldn't find the warming room for two.
2288,IV,
2289,IV,"One had to suffer, so I left him the fire"
2290,IV,And I went to the weather from my heart's desire.
2291,IV,
2292,IV,"It was night on the line, it was no more fire,"
2293,IV,But the zero whistle through the icy wire.
2294,IV,
2295,IV,As I went suffering through the snow
2296,IV,Something like a shadow came moving slow.
2297,IV,
2298,IV,I went up to it and I said a word;
2299,IV,Something flew above it like a kind of bird.
2300,IV,
2301,IV,I leaned in closer and I saw a face;
2302,IV,A light went round me but I kept my place.
2303,IV,
2304,IV,My heart went open like an apple sliced;
2305,IV,I saw my Saviour and I saw my Christ.
2306,IV,
2307,IV,"Well, you may not read it in a book,"
2308,IV,But it takes a gentle Saviour to give a gentle look.
2309,IV,
2310,IV,I looked in his eyes and I read the news;
2311,IV,His heart was having the railroad blues.
2312,IV,
2313,IV,"Oh, the railroad blues will cost you dear,"
2314,IV,Keeps you moving on for something that you don't see here.
2315,IV,
2316,IV,We stood and whispered in a kind of moon;
2317,IV,The line was looking like May and June.
2318,IV,
2319,IV,I found he was a roamer and a journey man
2320,IV,Looking for a lodging since the night began.
2321,IV,
2322,IV,He went to the doors but he didn't have the pay.
2323,IV,"He went to the windows, then he went away."
2324,IV,
2325,IV,"Says, ""We'll walk together and we'll both be fed."""
2326,IV,"Says, ""I will give you the `other' bread."""
2327,IV,
2328,IV,"Oh, the bread he gave and without money!"
2329,IV,"O drink, O fire, O burning honey!"
2330,IV,
2331,IV,It went all through me like a shining storm:
2332,IV,"I saw inside me, it was light and warm."
2333,IV,
2334,IV,"I saw deep under and I saw above,"
2335,IV,I saw the stars weighed down with love.
2336,IV,
2337,IV,"They sang that love to burning birth,"
2338,IV,They poured that music to the earth.
2339,IV,
2340,IV,I heard the stars sing low like mothers.
2341,IV,"He said:  ""Now look, and help feed others."""
2342,IV,
2343,IV,"I looked around, and as close as touch"
2344,IV,Was everybody that suffered much.
2345,IV,
2346,IV,"They reached out, there was darkness only;"
2347,IV,"They could not see us, they were lonely."
2348,IV,
2349,IV,"I saw the hearts that deaths took hold of,"
2350,IV,With the wounds bare that were not told of;
2351,IV,
2352,IV,Hearts with things in them making gashes;
2353,IV,Hearts that were choked with their dreams' ashes;
2354,IV,
2355,IV,"Women in front of the rolled-back air,"
2356,IV,Looking at their breasts and nothing there;
2357,IV,
2358,IV,Good men wasting and trapped in hells;
2359,IV,Hurt lads shivering with the fare-thee-wells.
2360,IV,
2361,IV,I saw them as if something bound them;
2362,IV,I stood there but my heart went round them.
2363,IV,
2364,IV,I begged him not to let me see them wasted.
2365,IV,"Says, ""Tell them then what you have tasted."""
2366,IV,
2367,IV,Told him I was weak as a rained-on bee;
2368,IV,"Told him I was lost. --  Says:  ""Lean on me."""
2369,IV,
2370,IV,"Something happened then I could not tell,"
2371,IV,But I knew I had the water for every hell.
2372,IV,
2373,IV,Any other thing it was no use bringing;
2374,IV,"They needed what the stars were singing,"
2375,IV,
2376,IV,"What the whole sky sang like waves of light,"
2377,IV,"The tune that it danced to, day and night."
2378,IV,
2379,IV,"Oh, I listened to the sky for the tune to come;"
2380,IV,"The song seemed easy, but I stood there dumb."
2381,IV,
2382,IV,The stars could feel me reaching through them
2383,IV,They let down light and drew me to them.
2384,IV,
2385,IV,"I stood in the sky in a light like day,"
2386,IV,Drinking in the word that all things say
2387,IV,
2388,IV,Where the worlds hang growing in clustered shapes
2389,IV,Dripping the music like wine from grapes.
2390,IV,
2391,IV,"With ""Love, Love, Love,"" above the pain,"
2392,IV,-- The vine-like song with its wine-like rain.
2393,IV,
2394,IV,Through heaven under heaven the song takes root
2395,IV,"Of the turning, burning, deathless fruit."
2396,IV,
2397,IV,"I came to the earth and the pain so near me,"
2398,IV,I tried that song but they couldn't hear me.
2399,IV,
2400,IV,"I went down into the ground to grow,"
2401,IV,A seed for a song that would make men know.
2402,IV,
2403,IV,Into the ground from my roamer's light
2404,IV,I went; he watched me sink to night.
2405,IV,
2406,IV,"Deep in the ground from my human grieving,"
2407,IV,His pain ploughed in me to believing.
2408,IV,
2409,IV,"Oh, he took earth's pain to be his bride,"
2410,IV,While the heart of life sang in his side.
2411,IV,
2412,IV,"For I felt that pain, I took its kiss,"
2413,IV,My heart broke into dust with his.
2414,IV,
2415,IV,Then sudden through the earth I found life springing;
2416,IV,The dust men trampled on was singing.
2417,IV,
2418,IV,Deep in my dust I felt its tones;
2419,IV,The roots of beauty went round my bones.
2420,IV,
2421,IV,"I stirred, I rose like a flame, like a river,"
2422,IV,"I stood on the line, I could sing forever."
2423,IV,
2424,IV,"Love had pierced into my human sheathing,"
2425,IV,Song came out of me simple as breathing.
2426,IV,
2427,IV,"A freight came by, the line grew colder,"
2428,IV,He laid his hand upon my shoulder.
2429,IV,
2430,IV,"Says, ""Don't stay on the line such nights,"""
2431,IV,And led me by the hand to the station lights.
2432,IV,
2433,IV,I asked him in front of the station-house wall
2434,IV,"If he had lodging.  Says, ""None at all."""
2435,IV,
2436,IV,I pointed to my heart and looked in his face. --
2437,IV,"""Here, -- if you haven't got a better place."""
2438,IV,
2439,IV,"He looked and he said:  ""Oh, we still must roam"
2440,IV,"But if you'll keep it open, well, I'll call it `home'."""
2441,IV,
2442,IV,The thrush now slept whose pillow was his wing.
2443,IV,So the song ended and the four remained
2444,IV,"Still in the faint starshine that silvered them,"
2445,IV,While the low sound went on of broken water
2446,IV,Out of the spring and through the darkness flowing
2447,IV,Over a stone that held it from the sea.
2448,IV,"Whether the men spoke after could not be told,"
2449,IV,"A mist from the ground so veiled them, but they waited"
2450,IV,A little longer till the moon came up;
2451,IV,"Then on the gilded track leading to the mountains,"
2452,IV,Against the moon they faded in common gold
2453,IV,And earth bore East with all toward the new morning.

2459,IV,
2460,IV,
2461,IV,
2462,IV,Because we felt there could not be
2463,IV,A mowing in reality
2464,IV,So white and feathery-blown and gay
2465,IV,"With blossoms of wild caraway,"
2466,IV,"I said to Celia, ""Let us trace"
2467,IV,"The secret of this pleasant place!"""
2468,IV,
2469,IV,We knew some deeper beauty lay
2470,IV,"Below the bloom of caraway,"
2471,IV,And when we bent the white aside
2472,IV,We came to paupers who had died:
2473,IV,"Rough wooden shingles row on row,"
2474,IV,And God's name written there -- `John Doe'.

2505,I,Every banner that the wide world flies
2506,I,Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes.
2507,I,"Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang,"
2508,I,"Tranced, fanatical, they shrieked and sang: --"
2509,I,"""Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?"""
2510,I,Hallelujah!  It was queer to see
2511,I,Bull-necked convicts with that land make free.

2522,II,Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God.
2523,II,"Booth led boldly, and he looked the chief,"
2524,II,"Eagle countenance in sharp relief,"
2525,II,"Beard a-flying, air of high command"
2526,II,Unabated in that holy land.
2527,II,
2528,II,(Sweet flute music)
2529,II,
2530,II,"Jesus came from out the court-house door,"
2531,II,Stretched his hands above the passing poor.

2535,II,"Marched on spotless, clad in raiment new."
2536,II,"The lame were straightened, withered limbs uncurled"

2552,II,"O, shout Salvation!  It was good to see"
2553,II,Kings and Princes by the Lamb set free.

2562,II,"For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down."

2573,II,
2574,II,I know the sorrows of the last abyss:
2575,II,I walked the cold black pools without a star;
2576,II,I lay on rock of unseen flint and spar;
2577,II,I heard the execrable serpent hiss;
2578,II,"I dreamed of sun, fruit-tree, and virgin's kiss;"
2579,II,"I woke alone with midnight near and far,"
2580,II,"And everlasting hunger, keen to mar;"
2581,II,"But I arose, and my reward is this:"
2582,II,I am no more one more amid the throng:
2583,II,"Though name be naught, and lips forever weak,"
2584,II,I seem to know at last of mighty song;
2585,II,"And with no blush, no tremor on the cheek,"
2586,II,I do claim consort with the great and strong
2587,II,Who suffered ill and had the gift to speak.

2644,II,
2645,II,Over and over I tell the sea:
2646,II,-- I am free!
2647,II,
2648,II,Over and over I tell my lover
2649,II,"I am free, free!"
2650,II,Over and over.

2660,II,The Enchanted Sheepfold.  [Josephine Preston Peabody]
2661,II,
2662,II,
2663,II,
2664,II,"The hills far-off were blue, blue,"
2665,II,The hills at hand were brown;
2666,II,And all the herd-bells called to me
2667,II,As I came by the down.
2668,II,
2669,II,"The briars turned to roses, roses;"
2670,II,Ever we stayed to pull
2671,II,"A white little rose, and a red little rose,"
2672,II,And a lock of silver wool.
2673,II,
2674,II,"Nobody heeded, -- none, none;"
2675,II,"And when True Love came by,"
2676,II,They thought him naught but the shepherd-boy.
2677,II,Nobody knew but I!
2678,II,
2679,II,"The trees were feathered like birds, birds;"
2680,II,Birds were in every tree.
2681,II,"Yet nobody heeded, nobody heard,"
2682,II,"Nobody knew, save me."
2683,II,
2684,II,And he is fairer than all -- all.
2685,II,How could a heart go wrong?
2686,II,"For his eyes I knew, and his knew mine,"
2687,II,"Like an old, old song."

2693,II,
2694,II,
2695,II,
2696,II,"By the rosy cliffs of Devon, on a green hill's crest,"
2697,II,I would build me a house as a swallow builds its nest;
2698,II,"I would curtain it with roses, and the wind should breathe to me"
2699,II,The sweetness of the roses and the saltness of the sea.
2700,II,
2701,II,"Where the Tuscan olives whiten in the hot blue day,"
2702,II,"I would hide me from the heat in a little hut of gray,"
2703,II,While the singing of the husbandman should scale my lattice green
2704,II,From the golden rows of barley that the poppies blaze between.
2705,II,
2706,II,"Narrow is the street, Dear, and dingy are the walls"
2707,II,Wherein I wait your coming as the twilight falls.
2708,II,All day with dreams I gild the grime till at your step I start --
2709,II,"Ah Love, my country in your arms -- my home upon your heart!"

2715,II,
2716,II,
2717,II,
2718,II,"I am not old, but old enough"
2719,II,To know that you are very young.
2720,II,"It might be said I am the leaf,"
2721,II,And you the blossom newly sprung.
2722,II,
2723,II,"So I shall grow a while with you,"
2724,II,"And hear the bee and watch the cloud,"
2725,II,"Before the dragon on the branch,"
2726,II,"The caterpillar, weaves a shroud."

2732,II,
2733,II,
2734,II,
2735,II,I envy the feeble old man
2736,II,Dozing there in the sun.
2737,II,When all you can do is done
2738,II,"And life is a shattered plan,"
2739,II,What is there better than
2740,II,Dozing in the sun?
2741,II,
2742,II,I could grow very still
2743,II,Like an old stone on a hill
2744,II,And content me with the one
2745,II,"Thing that is ever kind,"
2746,II,The tender sun.
2747,II,I could grow deaf and blind
2748,II,"And never hear her voice,"
2749,II,Nor think I could rejoice
2750,II,With her in any place;
2751,II,"And I could forget her face,"
2752,II,And love only the sun.
2753,II,"Because when we are tired,"
2754,II,"Very very tired,"
2755,II,And cannot again be fired
2756,II,"By any hope,"
2757,II,The sun is so comforting!
2758,II,A little bird under the wing
2759,II,"Of its mother, is not so warm."
2760,II,Give me only the scope
2761,II,Of an old chair
2762,II,"Out in the air,"
2763,II,"Let me rest there,"
2764,II,"Moving not,"
2765,II,"Loving not,"
2766,II,"Only dozing my days till my days be done,"
2767,II,Under the sun.

2775,II,
2776,II,If you should tire of loving me
2777,II,"Some one of our far days,"
2778,II,"Oh, never start to hide your heart"
2779,II,Or cover thought with praise.
2780,II,
2781,II,For every word you would not say
2782,II,"Be sure my heart has heard,"
2783,II,So go from me all silently
2784,II,Without a kiss or word;
2785,II,
2786,II,"For God must give you happiness,"
2787,II,"And Oh, it may befall"
2788,II,In listening long to Heaven-song
2789,II,I may not care at all!

2797,II,
2798,II,"When Dragon-fly would fix his wings,"
2799,II,"When Snail would patch his house,"
2800,II,When moths have marred the overcoat
2801,II,"Of tender Mister Mouse,"
2802,II,
2803,II,The pretty creatures go with haste
2804,II,To the sunlit blue-grass hills
2805,II,Where the Flower of Mending yields the wax
2806,II,And webs to help their ills.
2807,II,
2808,II,The hour the coats are waxed and webbed
2809,II,"They fall into a dream,"
2810,II,And when they wake the ragged robes
2811,II,Are joined without a seam.
2812,II,
2813,II,"My heart is but a dragon-fly,"
2814,II,"My heart is but a mouse,"
2815,II,My heart is but a haughty snail
2816,II,In a little stony house.
2817,II,
2818,II,"Your hand was honey-comb to heal,"
2819,II,Your voice a web to bind.
2820,II,You were a Mending Flower to me

2829,II,
2830,II,"Tell me,"
2831,II,Was Venus more beautiful
2832,II,"Than you are,"
2833,II,When she topped
2834,II,"The crinkled waves,"
2835,II,Drifting shoreward
2836,II,On her plaited shell?
2837,II,Was Botticelli's vision
2838,II,Fairer than mine;
2839,II,And were the painted rosebuds
2840,II,"He tossed his lady,"
2841,II,Of better worth
2842,II,Than the words I blow about you
2843,II,To cover your too great loveliness
2844,II,As with a gauze
2845,II,Of misted silver?
2846,II,
2847,II,"For me,"
2848,II,You stand poised
2849,II,"In the blue and buoyant air,"
2850,II,"Cinctured by bright winds,"
2851,II,Treading the sunlight.
2852,II,And the waves which precede you
2853,II,Ripple and stir
2854,II,The sands at your feet.

2860,II,
2861,II,
2862,II,
2863,II,"When the rose of Morn through the Dawn was breaking,"
2864,II,"And white on the hearth was last night's flame,"
2865,II,"Thither to me 'twixt sleeping and waking,"
2866,II,Singing out of the mists she came.
2867,II,
2868,II,And grey as the mists on the spectre meadows
2869,II,"Were the eyes that on my eyes she laid,"
2870,II,And her hair's red splendor through the shadows
2871,II,Like to the marsh-fire gleamed and played.
2872,II,
2873,II,And she sang of the wondrous far-off places
2874,II,"That a man may only see in dreams,"
2875,II,"The death-still, odorous, starlit spaces"
2876,II,Where Time is lost and no life gleams.
2877,II,
2878,II,"And there till the day had its crest uplifted,"
2879,II,"She stood with her still face bent on me,"
2880,II,Then forth with the Dawn departing drifted
2881,II,Light as a foam-fleck on the sea.
2882,II,
2883,II,And now my heart is the heart of a swallow
2884,II,"That here no solace of rest may find,"
2885,II,Forevermore I follow and follow
2886,II,Her white feet glancing down the wind.
2887,II,
2888,II,And forevermore in my ears are ringing --
2889,II,"(Oh, red lips yet shall I kiss you dumb!)"
2890,II,"Twain sole words of that May morn's singing,"
2891,II,"Calling to me ""Hither""! and ""Come""!"
2892,II,
2893,II,From flower-bright fields to the wild lake-sedges
2894,II,"Crying my steps when the Day has gone,"
2895,II,Till dim and small down the Night's pale edges
2896,II,The stars have fluttered one by one.
2897,II,
2898,II,"And light as the thought of a love forgotten,"
2899,II,"The hours skim past, while before me flies"
2900,II,"That face of the Sun and Mist begotten,"
2901,II,Its singing lips and death-cold eyes.

2908,II,
2909,II,
2910,II,I am in love with high far-seeing places
2911,II,"That look on plains half-sunlight and half-storm, --"
2912,II,In love with hours when from the circling faces
2913,II,"Veils pass, and laughing fellowship glows warm."
2914,II,You who look on me with grave eyes where rapture
2915,II,"And April love of living burn confessed, --"
2916,II,The Gods are good!  The world lies free to capture!
2917,II,Life has no walls.  O take me to your breast!
2918,II,"Take me, -- be with me for a moment's span! --"
2919,II,I am in love with all unveiled faces.
2920,II,I seek the wonder at the heart of man;
2921,II,I would go up to the far-seeing places.
2922,II,"While youth is ours, turn toward me for a space"
2923,II,The marvel of your rapture-lighted face!
2924,II,

2945,II,

2947,II,
2948,II,I'd rather have the thought of you
2949,II,"To hold against my heart,"
2950,II,My spirit to be taught of you
2951,II,"With west winds blowing,"
2952,II,Than all the warm caresses
2953,II,"Of another love's bestowing,"
2954,II,Or all the glories of the world
2955,II,In which you had no part.
2956,II,
2957,II,I'd rather have the theme of you
2958,II,"To thread my nights and days,"
2959,II,I'd rather have the dream of you
2960,II,"With faint stars glowing,"
2961,II,"I'd rather have the want of you,"
2962,II,"The rich, elusive taunt of you"
2963,II,Forever and forever and forever unconfessed
2964,II,Than claim the alien comfort
2965,II,Of any other's breast.
2966,II,
2967,II,"O lover! O my lover,"
2968,II,That this should come to me!
2969,II,"I'd rather have the hope for you,"
2970,II,"Ah, Love, I'd rather grope for you"
2971,II,Within the great abyss
2972,II,Than claim another's kiss --
2973,II,Alone I'd rather go my way
2974,II,Throughout eternity.

2983,II,"The bride, she wears a white, white rose -- the plucking it was mine;"
2984,II,The poet wears a laurel wreath -- and I the laurel twine;
2985,II,"And oh, the child, your little child, that's clinging close to you,"
2986,II,It laughs to wear my violets -- they are so sweet and blue!
2987,II,
2988,II,"And I, I have a wreath to wear -- ah, never rue nor thorn!"
2989,II,I sometimes think that bitter wreath could be more sweetly worn!
2990,II,"For mine is made of ghostly bloom, of what I can't forget --"

3004,II,
3005,II,We'll go and find the honey of romance
3006,II,Within the hollow of the sacred tree.
3007,II,"There is a spirit in the eastern sky,"
3008,II,Calling along the dawn to you and me.
3009,II,
3010,II,She'll lead us to the forest where she hides
3011,II,The yellow wine that keeps the angels young --

3092,II,Tree shade and grass blade
3093,II,And meadows in flower;

3095,II,Star-glow and shower;
3096,II,Cool-flowing song at night

3099,II,These were our friends.
3100,II,
3101,II,Under us the brown earth

3117,II,Glimmering pale
3118,II,Through the red heat of noon;

3120,II,Fairies broke fast with us;

3164,II,And beneath the silver green
3165,II,Of the birches' silent shadows
3166,II,Where the early violets lean.
3167,II,
3168,II,"Other pathways lead to Somewhere,"
3169,II,But the one I love so well
3170,II,Had no end and no beginning --
3171,II,"Just the beauty of the dell,"
3172,II,Just the windflowers and the lilies
3173,II,"Yellow striped as adder's tongue,"
3174,II,Seem to satisfy my pathway
3175,II,As it winds their sweets among.
3176,II,
3177,II,"There I go to meet the Springtime,"
3178,II,"When the meadow is aglow,"
3179,II,"Marigolds amid the marshes, --"
3180,II,And the stream is still and slow. --
3181,II,"There I find my fair oasis,"
3182,II,And with care-free feet I tread
3183,II,"For the pathway leads to Nowhere,"
3184,II,And the blue is overhead!
3185,II,
3186,II,All the ways that lead to Somewhere
3187,II,Echo with the hurrying feet
3188,II,"Of the Struggling and the Striving,"
3189,II,But the way I find so sweet
3190,II,"Bids me dream and bids me linger,"
3191,II,"Joy and Beauty are its goal, --"
3192,II,On the path that leads to Nowhere
3193,II,I have sometimes found my soul!

3199,II,
3200,II,
3201,II,
3202,II,"Some days my thoughts are just cocoons -- all cold, and dull, and blind,"
3203,II,They hang from dripping branches in the grey woods of my mind;
3204,II,
3205,II,And other days they drift and shine -- such free and flying things!
3206,II,"I find the gold-dust in my hair, left by their brushing wings."

3213,II,
3214,II,
3215,II,"Little park that I pass through,"
3216,II,I carry off a piece of you
3217,II,Every morning hurrying down
3218,II,To my work-day in the town;
3219,II,Carry you for country there
3220,II,To make the city ways more fair.
3221,II,"I take your trees,"
3222,II,"And your breeze,"
3223,II,"Your greenness,"
3224,II,"Your cleanness,"
3225,II,"Some of your shade, some of your sky,"
3226,II,Some of your calm as I go by;
3227,II,Your flowers to trim
3228,II,The pavements grim;
3229,II,Your space for room in the jostled street
3230,II,And grass for carpet to my feet.
3231,II,Your fountains take and sweet bird calls
3232,II,To sing me from my office walls.
3233,II,All that I can see
3234,II,I carry off with me.
3235,II,"But you never miss my theft,"
3236,II,So much treasure you have left.
3237,II,"As I find you, fresh at morning,"
3238,II,"So I find you, home returning --"
3239,II,Nothing lacking from your grace.
3240,II,All your riches wait in place
3241,II,For me to borrow
3242,II,On the morrow.
3243,II,
3244,II,"Do you hear this praise of you,"
3245,II,Little park that I pass through?

3254,II,"Pan, blow your pipes and I will be"
3255,II,"Your fern, your pool, your dream, your tree!"
3256,II,
3257,II,"I heard you play, caught your swift eye,"
3258,II,"""A pretty melody!"" called I,"
3259,II,"""Hail, Pan!""  And sought to pass you by."
3260,II,
3261,II,Now blow your pipes and I will sing
3262,II,To your sure lips' accompanying!
3263,II,
3264,II,"Wild God, who lifted me from earth,"
3265,II,"Who taught me freedom, wisdom, mirth,"
3266,II,"Immortalized my body's worth, --"
3267,II,
3268,II,"Blow, blow your pipes!  And from afar"
3269,II,"I'll come -- I'll be your bird, your star,"
3270,II,"Your wood, your nymph, your kiss, your rhyme,"
3271,II,And all your godlike summer-time!

3278,II,
3279,II,
3280,II,I will be the gladdest thing
3281,II,Under the sun!
3282,II,I will touch a hundred flowers
3283,II,And not pick one.
3284,II,
3285,II,I will look at cliffs and clouds
3286,II,"With quiet eyes,"
3287,II,"Watch the wind bow down the grass,"
3288,II,And the grass rise.
3289,II,
3290,II,And when lights begin to show
3291,II,"Up from the town,"
3292,II,"I will mark which must be mine,"
3293,II,And then start down!

3299,II,
3300,II,
3301,II,
3302,II,Out of the window a sea of green trees
3303,II,Lift their soft boughs like the arms of a dancer;
3304,II,"They beckon and call me, ""Come out in the sun!"""
3305,II,But I cannot answer.
3306,II,
3307,II,"I am alone with Weakness and Pain,"
3308,II,"Sick abed and June is going,"
3309,II,"I cannot keep her, she hurries by"
3310,II,With the silver-green of her garments blowing.
3311,II,
3312,II,Men and women pass in the street
3313,II,"Glad of the shining sapphire weather,"
3314,II,"But we know more of it than they,"
3315,II,Pain and I together.
3316,II,
3317,II,"They are the runners in the sun,"
3318,II,"Breathless and blinded by the race,"

3329,II,Mine eyes are filled today with old amaze
3330,II,"At mountains, and at meadows deftly strewn"
3331,II,With bits of the gay jewelry of June
3332,II,"And of her splendid vesture; and, agaze,"
3333,II,I stand where Spring her bright brocade of days
3334,II,"Embroidered o'er, and listen to the flow"
3335,II,"Of sudden runlets -- the faint blasts they blow,"
3336,II,"Low, on their stony bugles, in still ways."
3337,II,"For wonders are at one, confederate yet:"
3338,II,"Yea, where the wearied year came to a close,"
3339,II,An odor reminiscent of the rose;
3340,II,And everywhere her seal has Summer set;
3341,II,"And, as of old, in the horizon-sky,"
3342,II,The sun can find a lovely place to die.

3348,II,
3349,II,
3350,II,
3351,II,The swan existing
3352,II,Is like a song with an accompaniment
3353,II,Imaginary.
3354,II,
3355,II,"Across the grassy lake,"
3356,II,"Across the lake to the shadow of the willows,"
3357,II,"It is accompanied by an image,"
3358,II,-- as by Debussy's
3359,II,"""Reflets dans l'eau""."
3360,II,
3361,II,The swan that is
3362,II,Reflects
3363,II,Upon the solitary water -- breast to breast
3364,II,With the duplicity:
3365,II,"""~The other one!~"""
3366,II,
3367,II,And breast to breast it is confused.
3368,II,O visionary wedding!  O stateliness of the procession!
3369,II,It is accompanied by the image of itself
3370,II,Alone.
3371,II,
3372,II,At night
3373,II,"The lake is a wide silence,"

3380,II,
3381,II,
3382,II,
3383,II,I have an understanding with the hills
3384,II,At evening when the slanted radiance fills
3385,II,"Their hollows, and the great winds let them be,"
3386,II,And they are quiet and look down at me.
3387,II,"Oh, then I see the patience in their eyes"
3388,II,Out of the centuries that made them wise.
3389,II,They lend me hoarded memory and I learn
3390,II,"Their thoughts of granite and their whims of fern,"
3391,II,And why a dream of forests must endure
3392,II,"Though every tree be slain:  and how the pure,"
3393,II,Invisible beauty has a word so brief
3394,II,"A flower can say it or a shaken leaf,"
3395,II,"But few may ever snare it in a song,"
3396,II,Though for the quest a life is not too long.
3397,II,"When the blue hills grow tender, when they pull"
3398,II,"The twilight close with gesture beautiful,"
3399,II,"And shadows are their garments, and the air"
3400,II,"Deepens, and the wild veery is at prayer, --"
3401,II,Their arms are strong around me; and I know
3402,II,That somehow I shall follow when you go
3403,II,"To the still land beyond the evening star,"
3404,II,Where everlasting hills and valleys are:
3405,II,"And silence may not hurt us any more,"
3406,II,"And terror shall be past, and grief, and war."

3412,II,
3413,II,
3414,II,
3415,II,"It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning"
3416,II,"When the light drips through the shutters like the dew,"
3417,II,"I arise, I face the sunrise,"
3418,II,And do the things my fathers learned to do.
3419,II,Stars in the purple dusk above the rooftops
3420,II,"Pale in a saffron mist and seem to die,"
3421,II,And I myself on a swiftly tilting planet
3422,II,Stand before a glass and tie my tie.
3423,II,
3424,II,"Vine leaves tap my window,"
3425,II,"Dew-drops sing to the garden stones,"
3426,II,The robin chirps in the chinaberry tree
3427,II,Repeating three clear tones.
3428,II,
3429,II,It is morning.  I stand by the mirror
3430,II,And tie my tie once more.
3431,II,While waves far off in a pale rose twilight
3432,II,Crash on a white sand shore.
3433,II,I stand by a mirror and comb my hair:
3434,II,How small and white my face! --
3435,II,The green earth tilts through a sphere of air
3436,II,And bathes in a flame of space.
3437,II,There are houses hanging above the stars
3438,II,And stars hung under a sea . . .
3439,II,And a sun far off in a shell of silence
3440,II,Dapples my walls for me . . .
3441,II,
3442,II,"It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning"
3443,II,Should I not pause in the light to remember God?
3444,II,"Upright and firm I stand on a star unstable,"
3445,II,He is immense and lonely as a cloud.
3446,II,I will dedicate this moment before my mirror
3447,II,"To him alone, for him I will comb my hair."
3448,II,"Accept these humble offerings, cloud of silence!"
3449,II,I will think of you as I descend the stair.
3450,II,
3451,II,"Vine leaves tap my window,"
3452,II,"The snail-track shines on the stones,"
3453,II,Dew-drops flash from the chinaberry tree
3454,II,Repeating two clear tones.
3455,II,
3456,II,"It is morning, I awake from a bed of silence,"
3457,II,Shining I rise from the starless waters of sleep.
3458,II,"The walls are about me still as in the evening,"
3459,II,"I am the same, and the same name still I keep."
3460,II,"The earth revolves with me, yet makes no motion,"
3461,II,The stars pale silently in a coral sky.
3462,II,"In a whistling void I stand before my mirror,"
3463,II,"Unconcerned, and tie my tie."
3464,II,
3465,II,There are horses neighing on far-off hills
3466,II,"Tossing their long white manes,"
3467,II,"And mountains flash in the rose-white dusk,"
3468,II,Their shoulders black with rains . . .
3469,II,It is morning.  I stand by the mirror
3470,II,And surprise my soul once more;
3471,II,"The blue air rushes above my ceiling,"
3472,II,There are suns beneath my floor . . .
3473,II,
3474,II,". . . It is morning, Senlin says, I ascend from darkness"
3475,II,"And depart on the winds of space for I know not where,"
3476,II,"My watch is wound, a key is in my pocket,"
3477,II,And the sky is darkened as I descend the stair.
3478,II,"There are shadows across the windows, clouds in heaven,"
3479,II,And a god among the stars; and I will go
3480,II,Thinking of him as I might think of daybreak
3481,II,And humming a tune I know . . .
3482,II,
3483,II,"Vine-leaves tap at the window,"
3484,II,"Dew-drops sing to the garden stones,"

3495,II,"To-day I have grown taller from walking with the trees,"
3496,II,The seven sister-poplars who go softly in a line;
3497,II,And I think my heart is whiter for its parley with a star
3498,II,That trembled out at nightfall and hung above the pine.
3499,II,
3500,II,The call-note of a redbird from the cedars in the dusk
3501,II,Woke his happy mate within me to an answer free and fine;
3502,II,And a sudden angel beckoned from a column of blue smoke --
3503,II,"~Lord, who am I that they should stoop -- these holy folk of thine?~"

3512,II,I never knew the earth had so much gold --
3513,II,"The fields run over with it, and this hill,"
3514,II,"Hoary and old,"
3515,II,Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.
3516,II,
3517,II,"Such golden fires, such yellow -- lo, how good"
3518,II,"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God --"
3519,II,"This fringe of wood,"
3520,II,Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.
3521,II,
3522,II,"You too, beloved, are changed.  Again I see"
3523,II,"Your face grow mystical, as on that night"
3524,II,"You turned to me,"
3525,II,And all the trembling world -- and you -- were white.
3526,II,
3527,II,"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;"
3528,II,"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . ."

3535,II,Birches.  [Robert Frost]
3536,II,
3537,II,
3538,II,
3539,II,When I see birches bend to left and right
3540,II,"Across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
3541,II,I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
3542,II,But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
3543,II,Ice-storms do that.  Often you must have seen them
3544,II,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
3545,II,After a rain.  They click upon themselves
3546,II,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
3547,II,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
3548,II,"Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells,"
3549,II,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust --
3550,II,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
3551,II,You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
3552,II,"They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
3553,II,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
3554,II,"So low for long, they never right themselves:"
3555,II,You may see their trunks arching in the woods
3556,II,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
3557,II,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
3558,II,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
3559,II,But I was going to say when Truth broke in
3560,II,With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
3561,II,(Now am I free to be poetical?)
3562,II,I should prefer to have some boy bend them
3563,II,As he went out and in to fetch the cows --
3564,II,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
3565,II,"Whose only play was what he found himself,"
3566,II,"Summer or winter, and could play alone."
3567,II,One by one he subdued his father's trees
3568,II,By riding them down over and over again
3569,II,"Until he took the stiffness out of them,"
3570,II,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left"
3571,II,For him to conquer.  He learned all there was
3572,II,To learn about not launching out too soon
3573,II,And so not carrying the tree away
3574,II,Clear to the ground.  He always kept his poise
3575,II,"To the top branches, climbing carefully"
3576,II,With the same pains you use to fill a cup
3577,II,"Up to the brim, and even above the brim."
3578,II,"Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
3579,II,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
3580,II,So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
3581,II,And so I dream of going back to be.
3582,II,"It's when I'm weary of considerations,"
3583,II,And life is too much like a pathless wood
3584,II,Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
3585,II,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
3586,II,From a twig's having lashed across it open.
3587,II,I'd like to get away from earth awhile
3588,II,And then come back to it and begin over.
3589,II,May no fate willfully misunderstand me
3590,II,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
3591,II,Not to return.  Earth's the right place for love:
3592,II,I don't know where it's likely to go better.
3593,II,"I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
3594,II,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
3595,II,"TOWARD heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
3596,II,But dipped its top and set me down again.
3597,II,That would be good both going and coming back.
3598,II,One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

3606,II,
3607,II,"Fifty years spent before I found me,"
3608,II,"Wind on my mouth and the taste of the rain,"
3609,II,Where the great hills circled and swept around me
3610,II,And the torrents leapt to the mist-drenched plain;
3611,II,"Ah, it was long this coming of me"
3612,II,Back to the hills and the sounding sea.
3613,II,
3614,II,Ye who can go when so it tideth
3615,II,"To fallow fields when the Spring is new,"
3616,II,"Finding the spirit that there abideth,"
3617,II,Taking fill of the sun and the dew;
3618,II,Little ye know of the cross of the town
3619,II,And the small pale folk who go up and down.
3620,II,
3621,II,Fifty years spent before I found me
3622,II,"A bank knee-deep with climbing rose,"
3623,II,"Saw, or had space to look around me,"
3624,II,Knew how the apple buds and blows;
3625,II,And all the while that I thought me wise
3626,II,I walked as one with blinded eyes.
3627,II,
3628,II,Scarcely a lad who passes twenty
3629,II,But finds him a girl to balm his heart;
3630,II,"Only I, who had work so plenty,"
3631,II,Bade this loving keep apart:
3632,II,"Once I saw a girl in a crowd,"
3633,II,But I hushed my heart when it cried out aloud.
3634,II,
3635,II,"City courts in January, --"
3636,II,"City courts in wilted June,"
3637,II,Often ye will catch and carry
3638,II,Echoes of some straying tune;
3639,II,"Ah, but underneath the feet"
3640,II,Echo stifles in a street.
3641,II,
3642,II,"Fifty years spent, and what do they bring me?"
3643,II,Now I can buy the meadow and hill:
3644,II,Where is the heart of the boy to sing thee?
3645,II,Where is the life for thy living to fill?
3646,II,And thirty years back in a city crowd
3647,II,I passed a girl when my heart cried loud!

3656,II,"When, sick of all the sorrow and distress"
3657,II,"That flourished in the City like foul weeds,"
3658,II,"I sought blue rivers and green, opulent meads,"
3659,II,And leagues of unregarded loneliness
3660,II,"Whereon no foot of man had seemed to press,"
3661,II,"I did not know how great had been my needs,"
3662,II,"How wise the woodland's gospels and her creeds,"
3663,II,How good her faith to one long comfortless.
3664,II,
3665,II,But in the silence came a Voice to me;
3666,II,"In every wind it murmured, and I knew"
3667,II,It would not cease though far my heart might roam.
3668,II,"It called me in the sunrise and the dew,"
3669,II,"At noon and twilight, sadly, hungrily,"
3670,II,"The jealous City, whispering always -- ""Home!"""

3676,II,
3677,II,
3678,II,
3679,II,"Space, and the twelve clean winds of heaven,"
3680,II,"And this sharp exultation, like a cry, after the slow six thousand"
3681,II,steps of climbing!
3682,II,"This is Tai Shan, the beautiful, the most holy."
3683,II,
3684,II,"Below my feet the foot-hills nestle, brown with flecks of green;"
3685,II,"and lower down the flat brown plain, the floor of earth, stretches away"
3686,II,to blue infinity.
3687,II,Beside me in this airy space the temple roofs cut their slow curves
3688,II,"against the sky,"
3689,II,And one black bird circles above the void.
3690,II,
3691,II,"Space, and the twelve clean winds are here;"
3692,II,"And with them broods eternity -- a swift, white peace, a presence manifest."
3693,II,The rhythm ceases here.  Time has no place.  This is the end that has no end.
3694,II,
3695,II,"Here, when Confucius came, a half a thousand years before the Nazarene,"
3696,II,"he stepped, with me, thus into timelessness."
3697,II,"The stone beside us waxes old, the carven stone that says:  ""On this spot once"
3698,II,"Confucius stood and felt the smallness of the world below."""
3699,II,The stone grows old:
3700,II,Eternity is not for stones.
3701,II,"But I shall go down from this airy place, this swift white peace,"
3702,II,this stinging exultation.
3703,II,"And time will close about me, and my soul stir to the rhythm"
3704,II,of the daily round.
3705,II,"Yet, having known, life will not press so close, and always I shall feel time"
3706,II,ravel thin about me;
3707,II,For once I stood
3708,II,In the white windy presence of eternity.

3719,II,"My brother, man, shapes him a plan"
3720,II,"And builds him a house in a day,"
3721,II,But I have toiled through a million years
3722,II,For a home to last alway.
3723,II,"I have flooded the sands and washed them down,"
3724,II,I have cut through gneiss and granite.
3725,II,"No toiler of earth has wrought as I,"
3726,II,Since God's first breath began it.
3727,II,"High mountain-buttes I have chiselled, to shade"

3729,II,"With the wind's aid, and the cloud's aid,"
3730,II,"Unweary and mighty and unafraid,"

3732,II,
3733,II,"My brother, man, builds for a span:"
3734,II,His life is a moment's breath.
3735,II,"But I have hewn for a million years,"
3736,II,Nor a moment dreamt of death.
3737,II,By moons and stars I have measured my task --
3738,II,And some from the skies have perished:
3739,II,"But ever I cut and flashed and foamed,"
3740,II,As ever my aim I cherished:
3741,II,"My aim to quarry the heart of earth,"
3742,II,"Till, in the rock's red rise,"
3743,II,"Its age and birth, through an awful girth"
3744,II,"Of strata, should show the wonder-worth"
3745,II,Of patience to all eyes.
3746,II,
3747,II,"My brother, man, builds as he can,"
3748,II,"And beauty he adds for his joy,"
3749,II,But all the hues of sublimity
3750,II,My pinnacled walls employ.
3751,II,"Slow shadows iris them all day long,"
3752,II,"And silvery veils, soul-stilling,"
3753,II,"The moon drops down their precipices,"
3754,II,Soft with a spectral thrilling.
3755,II,For all immutable dreams that sway
3756,II,"With beauty the earth and air,"
3757,II,"Are ever at play, by night and day,"
3758,II,My house of eternity to array
3759,II,In visions ever fair.

3772,II,How dare you dash at Yosemite the mighty --
3773,II,"Tall, white limbed Yosemite, leaping down, down over the cliff?"
3774,II,Is it not enough to lean on the blue air of mountains?
3775,II,"Is it not enough to rest with your mate at timberline, in bushes that hug"
3776,II,the rocks?
3777,II,Must you fly through mad waters where the heaped-up granite breaks them?

3828,II,"I ascend my stairs once more,"
3829,II,"While waves, remote in a pale blue starlight,"
3830,II,Crash on a white sand shore.
3831,II,It is moonlight.  The garden is silent.
3832,II,I stand in my room alone.
3833,II,"Across my wall, from the far-off moon,"
3834,II,A rain of fire is thrown . . .
3835,II,
3836,II,"There are houses hanging above the stars,"
3837,II,And stars hung under a sea:
3838,II,And a wind from the long blue vault of time
3839,II,Waves my curtains for me . . .
3840,II,
3841,II,"I wait in the dark once more,"
3842,II,Swung between space and space:
3843,II,Before my mirror I lift my hands
3844,II,And face my remembered face.
3845,II,"Is it I who stand in a question here,"
3846,II,Asking to know my name? . . .
3847,II,"It is I, yet I know not whither I go,"

3851,II,"And arose and descended the stair,"
3852,II,"Conceiving a god in the eye of the sun, --"
3853,II,In a woman's hands and hair.
3854,II,It is I whose flesh is grey with the stones
3855,II,I builded into a wall:
3856,II,With a mournful melody in my brain
3857,II,Of a tune I cannot recall . . .
3858,II,
3859,II,There are roses to kiss:  and mouths to kiss;
3860,II,And the sharp-pained shadow of death.
3861,II,"I remember a rain-drop on my cheek, --"
3862,II,A wind like a fragrant breath . . .
3863,II,And the star I laugh on tilts through heaven;
3864,II,And the heavens are dark and steep . . .
3865,II,I will forget these things once more

3878,II,Pouring importunate on my window-sill.
3879,II,
3880,II,"I lowered my head, I hid it, I would not see nor hear,"
3881,II,"The birdsong had stricken me, had brought the moon too near."
3882,II,"But when I dared to lift my head, night began to fill"
3883,II,With singing in the darkness.  And then the thrush grew still.

3904,II,Of fruit-trees.
3905,II,

3907,II,"Paused not,"

3969,II,
3970,II,"Then I see you,"

3976,II,
3977,II,"You tell me that the peonies need spraying,"
3978,II,"That the columbines have overrun all bounds,"
3979,II,That the pyrus japonica should be cut back and rounded.

4013,II,Behind his mouth and his eyes are other mouth and eyes . . .
4014,II,Thirster after visions
4015,II,He sees the flowers to their roots and the Earth back through its silent ages:
4016,II,He parts the sky with his gaze:
4017,II,"He flings a magic on the hills, clothing them with Upanishad music,"
4018,II,Peopling the valley with dreamed images that vanished in Greece

4040,II,I walk down the patterned garden-paths
4041,II,"In my stiff, brocaded gown."
4042,II,"With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,"
4043,II,I too am a rare
4044,II,Pattern.  As I wander down
4045,II,The garden paths.
4046,II,
4047,II,"My dress is richly figured,"
4048,II,And the train
4049,II,Makes a pink and silver stain
4050,II,"On the gravel, and the thrift"
4051,II,Of the borders.
4052,II,"Just a plate of current fashion,"
4053,II,"Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes."
4054,II,"Not a softness anywhere about me,"
4055,II,Only whalebone and brocade.
4056,II,And I sink on a seat in the shade
4057,II,Of a lime tree.  For my passion
4058,II,Wars against the stiff brocade.
4059,II,The daffodils and squills
4060,II,Flutter in the breeze
4061,II,As they please.
4062,II,And I weep;
4063,II,For the lime tree is in blossom
4064,II,And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.
4065,II,
4066,II,And the plashing of waterdrops
4067,II,In the marble fountain
4068,II,Comes down the garden-paths.
4069,II,The dripping never stops.
4070,II,Underneath my stiffened gown
4071,II,"Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,"
4072,II,A basin in the midst of hedges grown
4073,II,"So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,"
4074,II,"But she guesses he is near,"
4075,II,And the sliding of the water
4076,II,Seems the stroking of a dear
4077,II,Hand upon her.
4078,II,What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!
4079,II,I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.
4080,II,All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.
4081,II,
4082,II,"I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,"
4083,II,"And he would stumble after,"
4084,II,Bewildered by my laughter.
4085,II,I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles
4086,II,on his shoes.
4087,II,I would choose
4088,II,"To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,"
4089,II,"A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,"
4090,II,"Till he caught me in the shade,"
4091,II,"And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,"
4092,II,"Aching, melting, unafraid."
4093,II,"With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,"
4094,II,"And the plopping of the waterdrops,"
4095,II,All about us in the open afternoon --
4096,II,I am very like to swoon
4097,II,"With the weight of this brocade,"
4098,II,For the sun sifts through the shade.
4099,II,
4100,II,Underneath the fallen blossom
4101,II,"In my bosom,"
4102,II,Is a letter I have hid.
4103,II,It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.
4104,II,"""Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell"
4105,II,"Died in action Thursday se'nnight."""
4106,II,"As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,"
4107,II,The letters squirmed like snakes.
4108,II,"""Any answer, Madam,"" said my footman."
4109,II,"""No,"" I told him."
4110,II,"""See that the messenger takes some refreshment."
4111,II,"No, no answer."""
4112,II,"And I walked into the garden,"
4113,II,"Up and down the patterned paths,"
4114,II,"In my stiff, correct brocade."
4115,II,"The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,"
4116,II,Each one.
4117,II,"I stood upright too,"
4118,II,Held rigid to the pattern
4119,II,By the stiffness of my gown.
4120,II,"Up and down I walked,"
4121,II,Up and down.
4122,II,
4123,II,In a month he would have been my husband.
4124,II,"In a month, here, underneath this lime,"
4125,II,We would have broke the pattern;
4126,II,"He for me, and I for him,"
4127,II,"He as Colonel, I as Lady,"
4128,II,On this shady seat.
4129,II,He had a whim
4130,II,That sunlight carried blessing.
4131,II,"And I answered, ""It shall be as you have said."""
4132,II,Now he is dead.
4133,II,
4134,II,In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
4135,II,Up and down
4136,II,The patterned garden-paths
4137,II,"In my stiff, brocaded gown."
4138,II,The squills and daffodils
4139,II,"Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow."
4140,II,I shall go
4141,II,Up and down
4142,II,In my gown.
4143,II,"Gorgeously arrayed,"
4144,II,Boned and stayed.

4157,II,
4158,II,
4159,II,"Whenever Richard Cory went down town,"
4160,II,We people on the pavement looked at him:
4161,II,"He was a gentleman from sole to crown,"
4162,II,"Clean favored, and imperially slim."
4163,II,
4164,II,"And he was always quietly arrayed,"
4165,II,And he was always human when he talked;
4166,II,"But still he fluttered pulses when he said,"
4167,II,"""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked."
4168,II,
4169,II,"And he was rich, -- yes, richer than a king, --"
4170,II,And admirably schooled in every grace:
4171,II,"In fine, we thought that he was everything"
4172,II,To make us wish that we were in his place.
4173,II,
4174,II,"So on we worked, and waited for the light,"
4175,II,"And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;"
4176,II,"And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,"
4177,II,Went home and put a bullet through his head.

4189,II,What hills of peace or pain he won?

4191,II,"I hope God smiled and took his hand,"

4200,II,
4201,II,
4202,II,
4203,II,"Oh, praise me not the silent folk;"
4204,II,To me they only seem
4205,II,"Like leafless, bird-abandoned oak"
4206,II,"And muffled, frozen stream."
4207,II,
4208,II,I want the leaves to talk and tell
4209,II,"The joy that's in the tree,"
4210,II,And water-nymphs to weave a spell
4211,II,Of pixie melody.
4212,II,
4213,II,"Your silent folk may be sincere,"
4214,II,"But still, when all is said,"
4215,II,"We have to grant they're rather drear, --"

4243,II,And his hands could lay hold on the tiger's terrible heart.
4244,II,"Blake knew how deep is Hell, and Heaven how high,"
4245,II,And could build the universe from one tiny part.
4246,II,"Blake heard the asides of God, as with furrowed brow"
4247,II,"He sifts the star-streams between the Then and the Now,"
4248,II,"In vast infant sagacity brooding, an infant's grace"
4249,II,"Shining serene on his simple, benignant face."
4250,II,
4251,II,"Blake was mad, they say, -- and Space's Pandora-box"
4252,II,"Loosed its wonders upon him -- devils, but angels indeed."
4253,II,"I, they say, am sane, but no key of mine unlocks"
4254,II,One lock of one gate wherethrough Heaven's glory is freed.
4255,II,"And I stand and I hold my breath, daylong, yearlong,"
4256,II,"Out of comfort and easy dreaming evermore starting awake, --"

4264,II,
4265,II,
4266,II,
4267,II,When I come back from secret dreams
4268,II,"In gardens deep and fair,"
4269,II,How very curious it seems --
4270,II,This mortal name I bear.
4271,II,
4272,II,For by this name I make their bread
4273,II,And trim the household light
4274,II,And sun the linen for the bed
4275,II,And close the door at night.
4276,II,
4277,II,"I wonder who myself may be,"
4278,II,And whence it was I came --
4279,II,Before the Church had laid on me
4280,II,This frail and earthly name.
4281,II,
4282,II,My sponsors spake unto the Lord
4283,II,"And three things promised they,"
4284,II,Upon my soul with one accord
4285,II,Their easy vows did lay.
4286,II,
4287,II,My ancient spirit heard them not.
4288,II,I think it was not there.
4289,II,But in a place they had forgot
4290,II,It drank a starrier air.
4291,II,
4292,II,"Yes, in a silent place and deep --"
4293,II,"There did it dance and run,"
4294,II,And sometimes it lay down to sleep
4295,II,Or sprang into the sun.
4296,II,
4297,II,The Priest saw not my aureole shine!
4298,II,My sweet wings saw not he!
4299,II,He graved me with a solemn sign
4300,II,And laid a name on me.
4301,II,
4302,II,"Now by this name I stitch and mend,"
4303,II,"The daughter of my home,"
4304,II,By this name do I save and spend
4305,II,"And when they call, I come."
4306,II,
4307,II,"But oh, that Name, that other Name,"
4308,II,More secret and more mine!
4309,II,It burns as does the angelic flame
4310,II,Before the midmost shrine.
4311,II,
4312,II,Before my soul to earth was brought
4313,II,"Into God's heart it came,"
4314,II,He wrote a meaning in my thought
4315,II,And gave to me a Name.
4316,II,
4317,II,By this Name do I ride the air
4318,II,"And dance from star to star,"
4319,II,"And I behold all things are fair,"
4320,II,For I see them as they are.
4321,II,
4322,II,"I plunge into the deepest seas,"
4323,II,"In flames I, laughing, burn."
4324,II,In roseate clouds I take my ease
4325,II,Nor to the earth return.
4326,II,
4327,II,It is my beauteous Name -- my own --
4328,II,That I have never heard.
4329,II,"God keeps it for Himself alone,"
4330,II,That strange and lovely word.
4331,II,
4332,II,God keeps it for Himself -- but yet
4333,II,"You are His voice, and so"
4334,II,"In your heart He is calling me,"
4335,II,And unto you I go.
4336,II,
4337,II,"Love, by this Name I sing, and breathe"
4338,II,"A fresh, mysterious air."
4339,II,By this I innocently wreathe
4340,II,New garlands for my hair.
4341,II,
4342,II,By this Name I am born anew
4343,II,"More beautiful, more bright."
4344,II,"More roseate than angelic dew,"
4345,II,Apparelled in delight.
4346,II,
4347,II,I'll sing and stitch and make the bread
4348,II,"In the wonder of my Name,"
4349,II,And sun the linen for the bed
4350,II,And tend the fireside flame.
4351,II,
4352,II,By this Name do I answer yes --
4353,II,Word beautiful and true.
4354,II,By this I'll sew the bridal dress
4355,II,I shall put on for you.

4369,II,A queen in wonderlands of song
4370,II,Where every blossom sings.
4371,II,I may put on a golden gown
4372,II,"And walk in sunny light,"
4373,II,"Carrying in my hair the day,"
4374,II,And in my eyes the night.
4375,II,
4376,II,It may be men will honor me --
4377,II,"The wistful ones and wise,"
4378,II,"Who know the ruth of victory,"
4379,II,The joy of sacrifice.
4380,II,"I may be rich, I may be gay,"
4381,II,But all the crowns grow old --
4382,II,The laurel withers and the bay
4383,II,And dully rusts the gold.
4384,II,
4385,II,Before I die I may break bread
4386,II,With many queens and kings --
4387,II,"Oh, take the golden gown away,"

4389,II,And I shall miss the love of babes

4403,II,
4404,II,"But now, with me, their generation fails,"

4407,II,Such women and men.
4408,II,
4409,II,"I have no son, whose life of flesh and fire"

4502,II,She rested on a log and tossed
4503,II,"The fresh chips,"
4504,II,With a song only to herself
4505,II,On her lips.
4506,II,
4507,II,And once she went to break a bough
4508,II,Of black alder.
4509,II,She strayed so far she scarcely heard
4510,II,When he called her --
4511,II,
4512,II,And didn't answer -- didn't speak --
4513,II,Or return.

4521,II,

4538,II,
4539,II,Yet is my love so great it needs must fill

5222,V,When I move and govern you.
5223,V,There is no small work unto God.
5224,V,He requires of us greatness;
5225,V,Of his least creature
5226,V,"A high angelic nature,"
5227,V,Stature superb and bright completeness.
5228,V,He sets to us no humble duty.
5229,V,Each act that he would have us do
5230,V,Is haloed round with strangest beauty.
5231,V,Terrific deeds and cosmic tasks
5232,V,Of his plainest child he asks.
5233,V,When I polish the brazen pan
5234,V,I hear a creature laugh afar
5235,V,"In the gardens of a star,"
5236,V,And from his burning presence run
5237,V,Flaming wheels of many a sun.
5238,V,"Whoever makes a thing more bright,"
5239,V,He is an angel of all light.
5240,V,When I cleanse this earthen floor
5241,V,My spirit leaps to see
5242,V,Bright garments trailing over it.
5243,V,"Wonderful lustres cover it,"
5244,V,A cleanness made by me.
5245,V,"Purger of all men's thoughts and ways,"

5247,V,My work is done for Thee.
5248,V,"Whoever makes a thing more bright,"

5258,VI,The air was soft with many a wing.
5259,VI,They laughed amid my solitude
5260,VI,And cast bright looks on everything.
5261,VI,Sweetly of me did they ask
5262,VI,That they might do my common task.
5263,VI,And all were beautiful -- but one
5264,VI,With garments whiter than the sun
5265,VI,Had such a face
5266,VI,"Of deep, remembered grace,"
5267,VI,"That when I saw I cried --  ""Thou art"
5268,VI,The great Blood-Brother of my heart.
5269,VI,"Where have I seen thee?"" --  And he said,"
5270,VI,"""When we are dancing 'round God's throne,"
5271,VI,How often thou art there.
5272,VI,Beauties from thy hands have flown
5273,VI,Like white doves wheeling in mid-air.
5274,VI,Nay -- thy soul remembers not?

5288,VII,
5289,VII,In the still cold before the sun
5290,VII,(Her Matins)    Her brothers and her sisters small
5291,VII,"She woke, and washed and dressed each one."
5292,VII,
5293,VII,And through the morning hours all
5294,VII,(Prime)         Singing above her broom she stood
5295,VII,And swept the house from hall to hall.
5296,VII,
5297,VII,Then out she ran with tidings good
5298,VII,"(Tierce)        Across the field and down the lane,"
5299,VII,To share them with the neighborhood.
5300,VII,
5301,VII,"Four miles she walked, and home again,"
5302,VII,(Sexts)         To sit through half the afternoon
5303,VII,And hear a feeble crone complain.
5304,VII,
5305,VII,But when she saw the frosty moon
5306,VII,"(Nones)         And lakes of shadow on the hill,"
5307,VII,Her maiden dreams grew bright as noon.
5308,VII,
5309,VII,She threw her pitying apron frill
5310,VII,(Vespers)       Over a little trembling mouse
5311,VII,When the sleek cat yawned on the sill.
5312,VII,
5313,VII,"In the late hours and drowsy house,"
5314,VII,"(Evensong)      At last, too tired, beside her bed"
5315,VII,She fell asleep -- her prayers half said.

5325,VII,Like an old opera tune
5326,VII,Played upon a harpsichord;
5327,VII,Or like the sun-flooded silks
5328,VII,Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.
5329,VII,In your eyes
5330,VII,"Smoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes,"
5331,VII,And the perfume of your soul
5332,VII,"Is vague and suffusing,"
5333,VII,With the pungence of sealed spice-jars.
5334,VII,"Your half-tones delight me,"
5335,VII,And I grow mad with gazing
5336,VII,At your blent colours.
5337,VII,
5338,VII,"My vigour is a new-minted penny,"
5339,VII,Which I cast at your feet.

5353,VII,She keeps her old simplicity and truth --
5354,VII,"And laughs at grim Mortality,"
5355,VII,This deathless Child that stays with me --
5356,VII,(This happy little ghost of my dead Youth!)
5357,VII,
5358,VII,My House of Life is weather-stained with years --
5359,VII,"(O Child in Me, I wonder why you stay.)"
5360,VII,"Its windows are bedimmed with rain of tears,"
5361,VII,"The walls have lost their rose, its thatch is gray."
5362,VII,"One after one its guests depart,"
5363,VII,So dull a host is my old heart.
5364,VII,"(O Child in Me, I wonder why you stay!)"
5365,VII,
5366,VII,"For jealous Age, whose face I would forget,"
5367,VII,Pulls the bright flowers you bring me from my hair
5368,VII,And powders it with snow; and yet -- and yet
5369,VII,I love your dancing feet and jocund air.
5370,VII,I have no taste for caps of lace
5371,VII,To tie about my faded face --
5372,VII,I love to wear your flowers in my hair.
5373,VII,
5374,VII,"O Child in Me, leave not my House of Clay"
5375,VII,"Until we pass together through the Door,"
5376,VII,"When lights are out, and Life has gone away"
5377,VII,And we depart to come again no more.
5378,VII,We comrades who have travelled far

5393,VII,
5394,VII,"Saying, ""The crop's all in,"

5413,VII,
5414,VII,
5415,VII,
5416,VII,I've seen her pass with eyes upon the road --
5417,VII,"An old bent woman in a bronze-black shawl,"
5418,VII,"With skin as dried and wrinkled as a mummy's,"
5419,VII,"As brown as a cigar-box, and her voice"
5420,VII,Like the low vibrant strings of a guitar.
5421,VII,And I have fancied from the girls about
5422,VII,"What she was at their age, what they will be"
5423,VII,When they are old as she.  But now she sits
5424,VII,"And smokes away each night till dawn comes round,"
5425,VII,"Thinking, beside the pinyons' flame, of days"
5426,VII,"Long past and gone, when she was young -- content"
5427,VII,"To be no longer young, her epic done:"
5428,VII,
5429,VII,"For a woman has work and much to do,"
5430,VII,"And it's good at the last to know it's through,"
5431,VII,"And still have time to sit alone,"
5432,VII,To have some time you can call your own.
5433,VII,It's good at the last to know your mind
5434,VII,"And travel the paths that you traveled blind,"
5435,VII,To see each turn and even make
5436,VII,Trips in the byways you did not take --
5437,VII,"But that, `por Dios', is over and done,"
5438,VII,It's pleasanter now in the way we've come;
5439,VII,It's good to smoke and none to say
5440,VII,"What's to be done on the coming day,"
5441,VII,"No mouths to feed or coat to mend,"
5442,VII,And none to call till the last long end.
5443,VII,"Though one have sons and friends of one's own,"
5444,VII,It's better at last to live alone.
5445,VII,"For a man must think of food to buy,"
5446,VII,And a woman's thoughts may be wild and high;
5447,VII,"But when she is young she must curb her pride,"
5448,VII,And her heart is tamed for the child at her side.
5449,VII,But when she is old her thoughts may go
5450,VII,"Wherever they will, and none to know."
5451,VII,"And night is the time to think and dream,"
5452,VII,And not to get up with the dawn's first gleam;
5453,VII,"Night is the time to laugh or weep,"
5454,VII,And when dawn comes it is time to sleep . . .
5455,VII,
5456,VII,"When it's all over and there's none to care,"
5457,VII,I mean to be like her and take my share
5458,VII,"Of comfort when the long day's done,"
5459,VII,"And smoke away the nights, and see the sun"
5460,VII,"Far off, a shrivelled orange in a sky gone black,"

5493,VII,"She got all together and she went like snow,"
5494,VII,"Like snow in the springtime on a sunny hill,"
5495,VII,And we were only frightened and can't think still.
5496,VII,
5497,VII,We can't think quite that the katydids and frogs
5498,VII,"And the little crying chickens and the little grunting hogs,"
5499,VII,And the other living things that she spoke for to us
5500,VII,Have nothing more to tell her since it happened thus.
5501,VII,
5502,VII,"She never is around for any one to touch,"
5503,VII,"But of ecstasy and longing she too knew much,"

5515,VII,"A wise old age anticipate,"
5516,VII,"Desiring, with his pipe and bowl,"
5517,VII,No Khan's extravagant estate.
5518,VII,"No crown annoyed his honest head,"
5519,VII,No fiddlers three were called or needed;
5520,VII,For two disastrous heirs instead
5521,VII,Made music more than ever three did.
5522,VII,
5523,VII,Bereft of her with whom his life
5524,VII,"Was harmony without a flaw,"
5525,VII,"He took no other for a wife,"
5526,VII,Nor sighed for any that he saw;
5527,VII,"And if he doubted his two sons,"
5528,VII,"And heirs, Alexis and Evander,"
5529,VII,He might have been as doubtful once
5530,VII,Of Robert Burns and Alexander.
5531,VII,
5532,VII,"Alexis, in his early youth,"
5533,VII,Began to steal -- from old and young.
5534,VII,"Likewise Evander, and the truth"
5535,VII,Was like a bad taste on his tongue.
5536,VII,"Born thieves and liars, their affair"
5537,VII,Seemed only to be tarred with evil --
5538,VII,The most insufferable pair
5539,VII,Of scamps that ever cheered the devil.
5540,VII,
5541,VII,"The world went on, their fame went on,"
5542,VII,And they went on -- from bad to worse;
5543,VII,"Till, goaded hot with nothing done,"
5544,VII,"And each accoutred with a curse,"
5545,VII,"The friends of Old King Cole, by twos,"
5546,VII,"And fours, and sevens, and elevens,"
5547,VII,Pronounced unalterable views
5548,VII,Of doings that were not of heaven's.
5549,VII,
5550,VII,And having learned again whereby
5551,VII,"Their baleful zeal had come about,"
5552,VII,King Cole met many a wrathful eye
5553,VII,So kindly that its wrath went out --
5554,VII,"Or partly out.  Say what they would,"
5555,VII,He seemed the more to court their candor;
5556,VII,But never told what kind of good
5557,VII,Was in Alexis and Evander.
5558,VII,
5559,VII,"And Old King Cole, with many a puff"
5560,VII,"That haloed his urbanity,"
5561,VII,"Would smoke till he had smoked enough,"
5562,VII,And listen most attentively.
5563,VII,He beamed as with an inward light
5564,VII,That had the Lord's assurance in it;
5565,VII,"And once a man was there all night,"
5566,VII,Expecting something every minute.
5567,VII,
5568,VII,"But whether from too little thought,"
5569,VII,"Or too much fealty to the bowl,"
5570,VII,A dim reward was all he got
5571,VII,For sitting up with Old King Cole.
5572,VII,"""Though mine,"" the father mused aloud,"
5573,VII,"""Are not the sons I would have chosen,"
5574,VII,"Shall I, less evilly endowed,"
5575,VII,By their infirmity be frozen?
5576,VII,
5577,VII,"""They'll have a bad end, I'll agree,"
5578,VII,But I was never born to groan;
5579,VII,"For I can see what I can see,"
5580,VII,And I'm accordingly alone.
5581,VII,"With open heart and open door,"
5582,VII,"I love my friends, I like my neighbors;"
5583,VII,"But if I try to tell you more,"
5584,VII,Your doubts will overmatch my labors.
5585,VII,
5586,VII,"""This pipe would never make me calm,"
5587,VII,This bowl my grief would never drown.
5588,VII,For grief like mine there is no balm
5589,VII,"In Gilead, or in Tilbury Town."
5590,VII,"And if I see what I can see,"
5591,VII,I know not any way to blind it;
5592,VII,Nor more if any way may be
5593,VII,For you to grope or fly to find it.
5594,VII,
5595,VII,"""There may be room for ruin yet,"
5596,VII,And ashes for a wasted love;
5597,VII,"Or, like One whom you may forget,"
5598,VII,I may have meat you know not of.
5599,VII,And if I'd rather live than weep
5600,VII,"Meanwhile, do you find that surprising?"
5601,VII,"Why, bless my soul, the man's asleep!"

5905,IV,"Near the old court-house pacing up and down,"
5906,IV,
5907,IV,"Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards"
5908,IV,"He lingers where his children used to play,"
5909,IV,"Or through the market, on the well-worn stones"
5910,IV,He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.
5911,IV,
5912,IV,"A bronzed, lank man!  His suit of ancient black,"
5913,IV,A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl
5914,IV,"Make him the quaint great figure that men love,"

5916,IV,

5919,IV,And we who toss and lie awake for long
5920,IV,"Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door."
5921,IV,
5922,IV,His head is bowed.  He thinks on men and kings.
5923,IV,"Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?"
5924,IV,"Too many peasants fight, they know not why,"
5925,IV,Too many homesteads in black terror weep.
5926,IV,
5927,IV,The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.
5928,IV,He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main.
5929,IV,He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now
5930,IV,"The bitterness, the folly and the pain."
5931,IV,
5932,IV,He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn
5933,IV,Shall come; -- the shining hope of Europe free:
5934,IV,"The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth,"
5935,IV,"Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea."
5936,IV,
5937,IV,"It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,"

5997,IV,"Under our curtain of fire,"
5998,IV,"Over the clotted clods,"
5999,IV,"We charged, to be withered, to reel"
6000,IV,And despairingly wheel
6001,IV,When the bugles bade us retire
6002,IV,From the terrible odds.
6003,IV,
6004,IV,"As we ebbed with the battle-tide,"
6005,IV,Fingers of red-hot steel
6006,IV,Suddenly closed on my side.
6007,IV,"I fell, and began to pray."
6008,IV,I crawled on my hands and lay
6009,IV,Where a shallow crater yawned wide;
6010,IV,Then I swooned. . . .
6011,IV,
6012,IV,"When I woke, it was yet day."
6013,IV,"Fierce was the pain of my wound,"
6014,IV,"But I saw it was death to stir,"
6015,IV,For fifty paces away
6016,IV,Their trenches were.
6017,IV,In torture I prayed for the dark
6018,IV,And the stealthy step of my friend
6019,IV,"Who, stanch to the very end,"
6020,IV,Would creep to the danger zone
6021,IV,And offer his life as a mark
6022,IV,To save my own.
6023,IV,
6024,IV,"Night fell.  I heard his tread,"
6025,IV,"Not stealthy, but firm and serene,"
6026,IV,As if my comrade's head
6027,IV,Were lifted far from that scene
6028,IV,Of passion and pain and dread;
6029,IV,As if my comrade's heart
6030,IV,In carnage took no part;
6031,IV,As if my comrade's feet
6032,IV,Were set on some radiant street
6033,IV,Such as no darkness might haunt;
6034,IV,"As if my comrade's eyes,"
6035,IV,"No deluge of flame could surprise,"
6036,IV,"No death and destruction daunt,"
6037,IV,"No red-beaked bird dismay,"
6038,IV,Nor sight of decay.
6039,IV,
6040,IV,Then in the bursting shells' dim light
6041,IV,I saw he was clad in white.
6042,IV,For a moment I thought that I saw the smock
6043,IV,Of a shepherd in search of his flock.
6044,IV,"Alert were the enemy, too,"
6045,IV,And their bullets flew
6046,IV,Straight at a mark no bullet could fail;
6047,IV,For the seeker was tall and his robe was bright;
6048,IV,But he did not flee nor quail.
6049,IV,"Instead, with unhurrying stride"
6050,IV,"He came,"
6051,IV,"And gathering my tall frame,"
6052,IV,"Like a child, in his arms . . ."
6053,IV,
6054,IV,"I slept,"
6055,IV,And awoke
6056,IV,From a blissful dream
6057,IV,In a cave by a stream.
6058,IV,My silent comrade had bound my side.
6059,IV,"No pain now was mine, but a wish that I spoke, --"
6060,IV,A mastering wish to serve this man
6061,IV,"Who had ventured through hell my doom to revoke,"
6062,IV,As only the truest of comrades can.
6063,IV,"I begged him to tell me how best I might aid him,"
6064,IV,And urgently prayed him
6065,IV,"Never to leave me, whatever betide;"
6066,IV,When I saw he was hurt --
6067,IV,Shot through the hands that were clasped in prayer!
6068,IV,"Then, as the dark drops gathered there"
6069,IV,"And fell in the dirt,"
6070,IV,The wounds of my friend
6071,IV,Seemed to me such as no man might bear.
6072,IV,Those bullet-holes in the patient hands
6073,IV,Seemed to transcend
6074,IV,All horrors that ever these war-drenched lands
6075,IV,Had known or would know till the mad world's end.
6076,IV,Then suddenly I was aware
6077,IV,"That his feet had been wounded, too;"
6078,IV,"And, dimming the white of his side,"
6079,IV,A dull stain grew.
6080,IV,"""You are hurt, White Comrade!"" I cried."
6081,IV,His words I already foreknew:
6082,IV,"""These are old wounds,"" said he,"
6083,IV,"""But of late they have troubled me."""

6096,IV,"Great, narrow, lovely things,"
6097,IV,As if an orchid had snatched wings.
6098,IV,There are strange birds like blots against a sky
6099,IV,Where a sun is dying.
6100,IV,Beyond the river where the hills are blurred
6101,IV,"A cloud, like the one word"
6102,IV,"Of the too-silent sky, stirs, and there stand"
6103,IV,Black trees on either hand.
6104,IV,Autumn in Oregon is wet and new

6112,IV,
6113,IV,Autumn in Oregon -- I'll never see

6117,IV,"Above my head, an indolent, trusting thing."
6118,IV,"When all this silly dream is finished here,"

6155,IV,"Three pines strained darkly, runners in a race"
6156,IV,Unseen by any.  Toward the further woods
6157,IV,A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased.
6158,IV,-- We were most silent in those solitudes --
6159,IV,"Then, sudden as a flame, the black-robed priest,"
6160,IV,The clotted earth piled roughly up about
6161,IV,"The hacked red oblong of the new-made thing,"

6170,IV,I have a Rendezvous with Death.  [Alan Seeger]
6171,IV,
6172,IV,
6173,IV,
6174,IV,I have a rendezvous with Death
6175,IV,"At some disputed barricade,"
6176,IV,When Spring comes back with rustling shade
6177,IV,And apple-blossoms fill the air --
6178,IV,I have a rendezvous with Death
6179,IV,When Spring brings back blue days and fair.
6180,IV,
6181,IV,It may be he shall take my hand
6182,IV,And lead me into his dark land
6183,IV,And close my eyes and quench my breath --
6184,IV,It may be I shall pass him still.
6185,IV,I have a rendezvous with Death
6186,IV,On some scarred slope of battered hill
6187,IV,When Spring comes round again this year
6188,IV,And the first meadow-flowers appear.
6189,IV,
6190,IV,God knows 'twere better to be deep
6191,IV,"Pillowed in silk and scented down,"
6192,IV,"Where Love throbs out in blissful sleep,"
6193,IV,"Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,"
6194,IV,Where hushed awakenings are dear . . .
6195,IV,But I've a rendezvous with Death
6196,IV,"At midnight in some flaming town,"
6197,IV,"When Spring trips north again this year,"
6198,IV,"And I to my pledged word am true,"
6199,IV,I shall not fail that rendezvous.

6204,IV,Rouge Bouquet.  [Joyce Kilmer]
6205,IV,
6206,IV,
6207,IV,
6208,IV,In a wood they call the Rouge Bouquet
6209,IV,"There is a new-made grave to-day,"
6210,IV,Built by never a spade nor pick
6211,IV,Yet covered with earth ten metres thick.
6212,IV,"There lie many fighting men,"
6213,IV,"Dead in their youthful prime,"
6214,IV,Never to laugh nor love again
6215,IV,Nor taste the Summertime.
6216,IV,For Death came flying through the air
6217,IV,"And stopped his flight at the dugout stair,"
6218,IV,"Touched his prey and left them there,"
6219,IV,Clay to clay.
6220,IV,He hid their bodies stealthily
6221,IV,In the soil of the land they fought to free
6222,IV,And fled away.
6223,IV,Now over the grave abrupt and clear
6224,IV,Three volleys ring;
6225,IV,And perhaps their brave young spirits hear
6226,IV,The bugle sing:
6227,IV,"""Go to sleep!"
6228,IV,Go to sleep!
6229,IV,Slumber well where the shell screamed and fell.
6230,IV,"Let your rifles rest on the muddy floor,"
6231,IV,You will not need them any more.
6232,IV,Danger's past;
6233,IV,"Now at last,"
6234,IV,"Go to sleep!"""
6235,IV,
6236,IV,There is on earth no worthier grave
6237,IV,To hold the bodies of the brave
6238,IV,Than this place of pain and pride
6239,IV,Where they nobly fought and nobly died.
6240,IV,Never fear but in the skies
6241,IV,Saints and angels stand
6242,IV,Smiling with their holy eyes
6243,IV,On this new-come band.
6244,IV,St. Michael's sword darts through the air
6245,IV,And touches the aureole on his hair
6246,IV,"As he sees them stand saluting there,"
6247,IV,His stalwart sons;
6248,IV,"And Patrick, Brigid, Columkill"
6249,IV,Rejoice that in veins of warriors still
6250,IV,The Gael's blood runs.
6251,IV,"And up to Heaven's doorway floats,"
6252,IV,"From the wood called Rouge Bouquet,"
6253,IV,A delicate cloud of buglenotes
6254,IV,That softly say:
6255,IV,"""Farewell!"
6256,IV,Farewell!
6257,IV,"Comrades true, born anew, peace to you!"
6258,IV,Your souls shall be where the heroes are
6259,IV,And your memory shine like the morning-star.
6260,IV,"Brave and dear,"
6261,IV,Shield us here.
6262,IV,"Farewell!"""

6271,IV,
6272,IV,
6273,IV,Nevermore singing
6274,IV,"Will you go now,"
6275,IV,Wearing wild moonlight
6276,IV,On your brow.
6277,IV,The moon's white mood
6278,IV,In your silver mind
6279,IV,Is all forgotten.
6280,IV,Words of wind
6281,IV,From off the hedgerow
6282,IV,"After rain,"
6283,IV,You do not hear them;
6284,IV,They are vain.
6285,IV,There is a linnet
6286,IV,"Craves a song,"
6287,IV,And you returning
6288,IV,Before long.
6289,IV,"Now who will tell her,"
6290,IV,Who can say
6291,IV,On what great errand
6292,IV,You are away?
6293,IV,You whose kindred
6294,IV,"Were hills of Meath,"
6295,IV,Who sang the lane-rose
6296,IV,"From her sheath,"
6297,IV,What voice will cry them
6298,IV,The grief at dawn
6299,IV,Or say to the blackbird
6300,IV,You are gone?

6306,IV,
6307,IV,
6308,IV,
6309,IV,"April now walks the fields again,"
6310,IV,Trailing her tearful leaves
6311,IV,And holding all her frightened buds against her heart:
6312,IV,"Wrapt in her clouds and mists,"
6313,IV,"She walks,"
6314,IV,Groping her way among the graves of men.
6315,IV,
6316,IV,"The green of earth is differently green,"
6317,IV,"A dreadful knowledge trembles in the grass,"
6318,IV,And little wide-eyed flowers die too soon:
6319,IV,There is a stillness here --
6320,IV,After a terror of all raving sounds --
6321,IV,And birds sit close for comfort upon the boughs
6322,IV,Of broken trees.
6323,IV,
6324,IV,"April, thou grief!"
6325,IV,"What of thy sun and glad, high wind,"
6326,IV,"Thy valiant hills and woods and eager brooks,"
6327,IV,Thy thousand-petalled hopes?
6328,IV,"~The sky forbids thee sorrow, April!~"
6329,IV,And yet --
6330,IV,I see thee walking listlessly
6331,IV,"Across those scars that once were joyous sod,"
6332,IV,"Those graves,"
6333,IV,Those stepping-stones from life to life.
6334,IV,
6335,IV,"Death is an interruption between two heart-beats,"
6336,IV,That I know --
6337,IV,Yet know not how I know --
6338,IV,"But April mourns,"
6339,IV,"Trailing her tender green,"
6340,IV,"The passion of her green,"
6341,IV,Across the passion of those fearful fields.
6342,IV,
6343,IV,"~Yes, all the fields!~"
6344,IV,"No barrier here,"
6345,IV,"No challenge in the night,"
6346,IV,No stranger-land;
6347,IV,"She passes with her perfect countersign,"
6348,IV,Her green;
6349,IV,"She wanders in her mournful garden,"
6350,IV,"Dropping her buds like tears,"
6351,IV,Spreading her lovely grief upon the graves of man.

6365,IV,The thorny crown still works its cruelty.
6366,IV,"Hark! while the victim suffers on the tree,"
6367,IV,"There sound through starry spaces, far and wide,"
6368,IV,Such words as in the last despair are cried:
6369,IV,"""My God! my God! Thou hast forsaken me!"""
6370,IV,
6371,IV,"But when earth's members from the cross are drawn,"
6372,IV,"And all we love into the grave is gone,"
6373,IV,This hope shall be a spark within the gloom:

6389,IV,
6390,IV,In fields where hate has hurled

6402,IV,"In spite of war, in spite of death,"
6403,IV,"In spite of all man's sufferings,"

6405,IV,And I must praise with all my breath.
6406,IV,"In spite of war, in spite of hate"
6407,IV,"Lilacs are blooming at my gate,"
6408,IV,Tulips are tripping down the path
6409,IV,"In spite of war, in spite of wrath."
6410,IV,"""Courage!"" the morning-glory saith;"
6411,IV,"""Rejoice!"" the daisy murmureth,"
6412,IV,And just to live is so divine
6413,IV,When pansies lift their eyes to mine.
6414,IV,
6415,IV,"The clouds are romping with the sea,"
6416,IV,And flashing waves call back to me
6417,IV,"That naught is real but what is fair,"
6418,IV,That everywhere and everywhere
6419,IV,A glory liveth through despair.
6420,IV,"Though guns may roar and cannon boom,"
6421,IV,Roses are born and gardens bloom;
6422,IV,My spirit still may light its flame
6423,IV,At that same torch whence poppies came.
6424,IV,Where morning's altar whitely burns
6425,IV,Lilies may lift their silver urns
6426,IV,"In spite of war, in spite of shame."
6427,IV,
6428,IV,"And in my ear a whispering breath,"

6507,IV,For all that they have seen disastrous things:
6508,IV,"The shattered pomp, the split and shaken throne,"
6509,IV,They cannot quite forget the way of Kings:
6510,IV,"Gravely they pass, majestic and alone."
6511,IV,
6512,IV,"With thunder on their brows, their faces set"
6513,IV,"Toward the eternal night of restless shapes,"

6578,IV,Of all the woods at Fontainebleau.
6579,IV,"They peered into that ancient well,"
6580,IV,And watched the slow torch as it fell.
6581,IV,"John gave the keeper two whole sous,"
6582,IV,And Jeanne that smile with which she woos
6583,IV,John Brown to folly.  So they lose
6584,IV,The Paris train.  But never mind! --
6585,IV,"All-Saints are rustling in the wind,"

6587,IV,"(It's `deux-cinquante', but Jeanne's desire);"
6588,IV,"There's dinner, candles, country wine,"
6589,IV,Jeanne's lips -- philosophy divine!
6590,IV,
6591,IV,There was a bosquet at Saint Cloud
6592,IV,Wherein John's picture of her grew
6593,IV,To be a Salon masterpiece --
6594,IV,Till the rain fell that would not cease.
6595,IV,Through one long alley how they raced! --
6596,IV,"'T was gold and brown, and all a waste"

6598,IV,Shades of mad queens and hunter-kings
6599,IV,And thorn-sharp feet of dryad-things

6615,IV,The tempting tidy little shops;
6616,IV,"The convent walls, the glimpsed tree-tops;"
6617,IV,"Book-stalls, old men like dwarfs in plays;"

6625,IV,"Lilac, laburnum's golden showers."
6626,IV,"Kiss, clink of glasses, laughter heard,"
6627,IV,And nightingales quite undeterred.
6628,IV,And then that last extravagance --
6629,IV,"O Jeanne, a single amber glance"
6630,IV,"Will pay him! --  ""Let's play millionaire"

6632,IV,At some hotel where lovers dine

6635,IV,Where stiff silk roses range their bloom.
6636,IV,The garcon has a splendid way
6637,IV,Of bearing in grand dejeuner.
6638,IV,"Then to be left alone, alone,"
6639,IV,High up above Rue Castiglione;
6640,IV,Curtained away from all the rude

6681,IV,"Which shall we choose, the human or divine,"
6682,IV,"The crystal stream, or yet the crimson wine?"

6687,IV,Apology.  [Amy Lowell]
6688,IV,
6689,IV,
6690,IV,
6691,IV,Be not angry with me that I bear
6692,IV,"Your colours everywhere,"
6693,IV,"All through each crowded street,"
6694,IV,And meet
6695,IV,"The wonder-light in every eye,"
6696,IV,As I go by.
6697,IV,
6698,IV,"Each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze,"
6699,IV,"Blinded by rainbow haze,"
6700,IV,"The stuff of happiness,"
6701,IV,"No less,"
6702,IV,Which wraps me in its glad-hued folds
6703,IV,Of peacock golds.
6704,IV,
6705,IV,"Before my feet the dusty, rough-paved way"
6706,IV,Flushes beneath its gray.
6707,IV,"My steps fall ringed with light,"
6708,IV,"So bright,"
6709,IV,It seems a myriad suns are strown
6710,IV,About the town.
6711,IV,
6712,IV,"Around me is the sound of steepled bells,"
6713,IV,And rich perfumed smells
6714,IV,"Hang like a wind-forgotten cloud,"
6715,IV,And shroud
6716,IV,Me from close contact with the world.
6717,IV,I dwell impearled.
6718,IV,
6719,IV,You blazon me with jewelled insignia.
6720,IV,A flaming nebula
6721,IV,Rims in my life.  And yet
6722,IV,You set
6723,IV,"The word upon me, unconfessed"
6724,IV,To go unguessed.

6730,IV,
6731,IV,
6732,IV,
6733,IV,I cannot tell you now;
6734,IV,When the wind's drive and whirl
6735,IV,"Blow me along no longer,"
6736,IV,And the wind's a whisper at last --
6737,IV,Maybe I'll tell you then --
6738,IV,some other time.
6739,IV,
6740,IV,When the rose's flash to the sunset
6741,IV,"Reels to the wrack and the twist,"
6742,IV,"And the rose is a red bygone,"
6743,IV,When the face I love is going
6744,IV,"And the gate to the end shall clang,"
6745,IV,"And it's no use to beckon or say, ""So long"" --"
6746,IV,Maybe I'll tell you then --
6747,IV,some other time.
6748,IV,
6749,IV,I never knew any more beautiful than you:
6750,IV,"I have hunted you under my thoughts,"
6751,IV,I have broken down under the wind
6752,IV,And into the roses looking for you.
6753,IV,I shall never find any
6754,IV,greater than you.

6759,IV,Dialogue.  [Walter Conrad Arensberg]
6760,IV,
6761,IV,
6762,IV,
6763,IV,"Be patient, Life, when Love is at the gate,"
6764,IV,And when he enters let him be at home.
6765,IV,Think of the roads that he has had to roam.
6766,IV,Think of the years that he has had to wait.
6767,IV,
6768,IV,~But if I let Love in I shall be late.
6769,IV,Another has come first -- there is no room.
6770,IV,And I am thoughtful of the endless loom --
6771,IV,"Let Love be patient, the importunate.~"
6772,IV,
6773,IV,"O Life, be idle and let Love come in,"
6774,IV,And give thy dreamy hair that Love may spin.
6775,IV,
6776,IV,~But Love himself is idle with his song.
6777,IV,"Let Love come last, and then may Love last long.~"
6778,IV,
6779,IV,"Be patient, Life, for Love is not the last."
6780,IV,"Be patient now with Death, for Love has passed."

6786,IV,
6787,IV,
6788,IV,
6789,IV,"The Spring will come when the year turns,"
6790,IV,"As if no Winter had been,"
6791,IV,But what shall I do with a locked heart
6792,IV,That lets no new year in?
6793,IV,
6794,IV,"The birds will go when the Fall goes,"
6795,IV,"The leaves will fade in the field,"
6796,IV,But what shall I do with an old love
6797,IV,Will neither die nor yield?
6798,IV,
6799,IV,"Oh! youth will turn as the world turns,"
6800,IV,"And dim grow laughter and pain,"
6801,IV,But how shall I hide from an old dream
6802,IV,I never may dream again?

6807,IV,The Bitter Herb.  [Jeanne Robert Foster]
6808,IV,
6809,IV,
6810,IV,
6811,IV,"O bitter herb, Forgetfulness,"
6812,IV,I search for you in vain;
6813,IV,You are the only growing thing
6814,IV,Can take away my pain.
6815,IV,
6816,IV,"When I was young, this bitter herb"
6817,IV,Grew wild on every hill;
6818,IV,"I should have plucked a store of it,"
6819,IV,And kept it by me still.
6820,IV,
6821,IV,I hunt through all the meadows
6822,IV,"Where once I wandered free,"
6823,IV,"But the rare herb, Forgetfulness,"
6824,IV,It hides away from me.
6825,IV,
6826,IV,"O bitter herb, Forgetfulness,"
6827,IV,Where is your drowsy breath?
6828,IV,"Oh, can it be your seed has blown"
6829,IV,Far as the Vales of Death?
6830,IV,

6834,IV,Behind the House is the Millet Plot.  [Muna Lee]
6835,IV,
6836,IV,
6837,IV,
6838,IV,"Behind the house is the millet plot,"
6839,IV,"And past the millet, the stile;"
6840,IV,And then a hill where melilot
6841,IV,Grows with wild camomile.
6842,IV,
6843,IV,There was a youth who bade me goodby
6844,IV,Where the hill rises to meet the sky.
6845,IV,I think my heart broke; but I have forgot
6846,IV,All but the smell of the white melilot.

6851,IV,Men of Harlan.  [William Aspinwall Bradley]
6852,IV,
6853,IV,
6854,IV,
6855,IV,"Here in the level country, where the creeks run straight and wide,"
6856,IV,Six men upon their pacing nags may travel side by side.
6857,IV,"But the mountain men of Harlan, you may tell them all the while,"
6858,IV,"When they pass through our village, for they ride in single file."
6859,IV,"And the children, when they see them, stop their play and stand and cry,"
6860,IV,"""Here come the men of Harlan, men of Harlan, riding by!"""
6861,IV,
6862,IV,"O the mountain men of Harlan, when they come down to the plain,"
6863,IV,"With dangling stirrup, jangling spur, and loosely hanging rein,"
6864,IV,"They do not ride, like our folks here, in twos and threes abreast,"
6865,IV,"With merry laughter, talk and song, and lightly spoken jest;"
6866,IV,"But silently and solemnly, in long and straggling line,"
6867,IV,"As you may see them in the hills, beyond Big Black and Pine."
6868,IV,
6869,IV,"For, in that far strange country, where the men of Harlan dwell,"
6870,IV,"There are no roads at all, like ours, as we've heard travelers tell."
6871,IV,"But only narrow trails that wind along each shallow creek,"
6872,IV,"Where the silence hangs so heavy, you can hear the leathers squeak."
6873,IV,"And there no two can ride abreast, but each alone must go,"
6874,IV,"Picking his way as best he may, with careful steps and slow,"
6875,IV,
6876,IV,"Down many a shelving ledge of shale, skirting the trembling sands,"
6877,IV,"Through many a pool and many a pass, where the mountain laurel stands"
6878,IV,"So thick and close to left and right, with holly bushes, too,"
6879,IV,"The clinging branches meet midway to bar the passage through, --"
6880,IV,"O'er many a steep and stony ridge, o'er many a high divide,"
6881,IV,And so it is the Harlan men thus one by one do ride.
6882,IV,
6883,IV,"Yet it is strange to see them pass in line through our wide street,"
6884,IV,"When they come down to sell their sang, and buy their stores of meat,"
6885,IV,"These silent men, in sombre black, all clad from foot to head,"
6886,IV,Though they have left their lonely hills and the narrow creek's rough bed.
6887,IV,And 't is no wonder children stop their play and stand and cry:
6888,IV,"""Here come the men of Harlan, men of Harlan, riding by."""

6893,IV,Have you an Eye.  [Edwin Ford Piper]
6894,IV,
6895,IV,
6896,IV,
6897,IV,"Have you an eye for the trails, the trails,"
6898,IV,The old mark and the new?
6899,IV,"What scurried here, what loitered there,"
6900,IV,In the dust and in the dew?
6901,IV,
6902,IV,"Have you an eye for the beaten track,"
6903,IV,The old hoof and the young?
6904,IV,"Come name me the drivers of yesterday,"
6905,IV,Sing me the songs they sung.
6906,IV,
6907,IV,"O, was it a schooner last went by,"
6908,IV,And where will it ford the stream?
6909,IV,"Where will it halt in the early dusk,"
6910,IV,And where will the camp-fire gleam?
6911,IV,
6912,IV,They used to take the shortest cut
6913,IV,The cattle trails had made;
6914,IV,Get down the hill by the easy slope
6915,IV,To the water and the shade.
6916,IV,
6917,IV,"But it's barbed wire fence, and section line,"
6918,IV,And kill-horse travel now;
6919,IV,"Scoot you down the canyon bank, --"
6920,IV,The old road's under plough.
6921,IV,
6922,IV,"Have you an eye for the laden wheel,"
6923,IV,The worn tire or the new?
6924,IV,Or the sign of the prairie pony's hoof
6925,IV,Was never trimmed for shoe?

6930,IV,After Apple-Picking.  [Robert Frost]
6931,IV,
6932,IV,
6933,IV,
6934,IV,My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
6935,IV,"Toward heaven still,"
6936,IV,And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
6937,IV,"Beside it, and there may be two or three"
6938,IV,Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
6939,IV,But I am done with apple-picking now.
6940,IV,"Essence of winter sleep is on the night,"
6941,IV,The scent of apples:  I am drowsing off.
6942,IV,I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
6943,IV,I got from looking through a pane of glass
6944,IV,I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
6945,IV,And held against the world of hoary grass.
6946,IV,"It melted, and I let it fall and break."
6947,IV,But I was well
6948,IV,"Upon my way to sleep before it fell,"
6949,IV,And I could tell
6950,IV,What form my dreaming was about to take.
6951,IV,"Magnified apples appear and disappear,"
6952,IV,"Stem end and blossom end,"
6953,IV,And every fleck of russet showing clear.
6954,IV,"My instep arch not only keeps the ache,"
6955,IV,It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
6956,IV,I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
6957,IV,And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
6958,IV,The rumbling sound
6959,IV,Of load on load of apples coming in.
6960,IV,For I have had too much
6961,IV,Of apple-picking:  I am overtired
6962,IV,Of the great harvest I myself desired.
6963,IV,"There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,"
6964,IV,"Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall."
6965,IV,For all
6966,IV,"That struck the earth,"
6967,IV,"No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,"
6968,IV,Went surely to the cider-apple heap
6969,IV,As of no worth.
6970,IV,One can see what will trouble
6971,IV,"This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is."
6972,IV,"Were he not gone,"
6973,IV,The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
6974,IV,"Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,"
6975,IV,Or just some human sleep.

6983,IV,
6984,IV,
6985,IV,
6986,IV,"How memory cuts away the years,"
6987,IV,And how clean the picture comes
6988,IV,"Of autumn days, brisk and busy;"
6989,IV,Charged with keen sunshine.
6990,IV,"And you, stirred with activity;"
6991,IV,The spirit of these energetic days.
6992,IV,
6993,IV,"There was our back-yard,"
6994,IV,"So plain and stripped of green,"
6995,IV,With even the weeds carefully pulled away
6996,IV,"From the crooked, red bricks that made the walk,"
6997,IV,And the earth on either side so black.
6998,IV,
6999,IV,Autumn and dead leaves burning in the sharp air;
7000,IV,And winter comforts coming in like a pageant.
7001,IV,I shall not forget them:
7002,IV,"Great jars laden with the raw green of pickles,"
7003,IV,"Standing in a solemn row across the back of the porch,"
7004,IV,Exhaling the pungent dill;
7005,IV,"And in the very center of the yard,"
7006,IV,"You, tending the great catsup kettle of gleaming copper"
7007,IV,"Where fat, red tomatoes bobbed up and down"
7008,IV,Like jolly monks in a drunken dance.
7009,IV,"And there were bland banks of cabbages that came by the wagon-load,"
7010,IV,Soon to be cut into delicate ribbons
7011,IV,"Only to be crushed by the heavy, wooden stompers."
7012,IV,Such feathery whiteness -- to come to kraut!
7013,IV,"And after, there were grapes that hid their brightness under a grey dust,"
7014,IV,"Then gushed thrilling, purple blood over the fire;"
7015,IV,And enamelled crab-apples that tricked with their fragrance
7016,IV,But were bitter to taste.
7017,IV,"And there were spicy plums and ill-shaped quinces,"
7018,IV,And long string beans floating in pans of clear water
7019,IV,"Like slim, green fishes."
7020,IV,"And there was fish itself,"
7021,IV,"Salted, silver herring from the city . . ."
7022,IV,
7023,IV,"And you moved among these mysteries,"
7024,IV,Absorbed and smiling and sure;
7025,IV,"Stirring, tasting, measuring,"
7026,IV,With the precision of a ritual.
7027,IV,I like to think of you in your years of power --
7028,IV,"You, now so shaken and so powerless --"
7029,IV,High priestess of your home.

7041,IV,"sunburned woman, the mother of the year, the taker of seeds."
7042,IV,
7043,IV,"The northwest wind comes and the yellow is torn full of holes,"
7044,IV,"new beautiful things come in the first spit of snow on the northwest wind,"

7056,IV,Thy mists that roll and rise!
7057,IV,"Thy woods this autumn day, that ache and sag"
7058,IV,And all but cry with colour!  That gaunt crag
7059,IV,To crush!  To lift the lean of that black bluff!
7060,IV,"World, World, I cannot get thee close enough!"
7061,IV,
7062,IV,"Long have I known a glory in it all,"
7063,IV,But never knew I this;
7064,IV,Here such a passion is
7065,IV,"As stretcheth me apart, -- Lord, I do fear"
7066,IV,Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year;
7067,IV,"My soul is all but out of me, -- let fall"

7074,IV,
7075,IV,
7076,IV,
7077,IV,I heard a bird at break of day
7078,IV,Sing from the autumn trees
7079,IV,"A song so mystical and calm,"
7080,IV,"So full of certainties,"
7081,IV,"No man, I think, could listen long"
7082,IV,Except upon his knees.
7083,IV,"Yet this was but a simple bird,"
7084,IV,"Alone, among dead trees."

7092,IV,
7093,IV,I cannot but remember
7094,IV,When the year grows old --
7095,IV,October -- November --
7096,IV,How she disliked the cold!
7097,IV,
7098,IV,She used to watch the swallows
7099,IV,"Go down across the sky,"
7100,IV,And turn from the window
7101,IV,With a little sharp sigh.
7102,IV,
7103,IV,And often when the brown leaves
7104,IV,"Were brittle on the ground,"
7105,IV,And the wind in the chimney
7106,IV,"Made a melancholy sound,"
7107,IV,
7108,IV,She had a look about her
7109,IV,That I wish I could forget --
7110,IV,The look of a scared thing
7111,IV,Sitting in a net!
7112,IV,
7113,IV,"Oh, beautiful at nightfall"
7114,IV,The soft spitting snow!
7115,IV,And beautiful the bare boughs
7116,IV,Rubbing to and fro!
7117,IV,
7118,IV,"But the roaring of the fire,"
7119,IV,"And the warmth of fur,"
7120,IV,And the boiling of the kettle
7121,IV,Were beautiful to her!
7122,IV,
7123,IV,I cannot but remember
7124,IV,When the year grows old --
7125,IV,October -- November --
7126,IV,How she disliked the cold!

7135,IV,"Cold is the wind to-night, and rough the sea,"
7136,IV,Too rough for even the daring Dane to find
7137,IV,A landing-place upon the frozen lea.
7138,IV,Cold is the wind.
7139,IV,
7140,IV,"The blast sweeps round the chapel from behind,"
7141,IV,"Making the altar-light flare fitfully,"
7142,IV,While I must kneel and pray with troubled mind.
7143,IV,
7144,IV,"Patrick and Brigid, I have prayed to ye!"
7145,IV,"The night is over, and my task resigned"
7146,IV,"To Colum.  Though God's own dwelling shelter me,"

7164,IV,It cannot frighten me.
7165,IV,
7166,IV,The Narrow Doors to Sorrow
7167,IV,"Are secret, still, and low:"
7168,IV,Swift tongues of dusk that spoil the sun
7169,IV,Before I even know.
7170,IV,
7171,IV,My dancing feet are frozen.
7172,IV,I stare.  I can but see.

7175,IV,
7176,IV,"-- Oh, stranger than my midnights"

7192,IV,
7193,IV,"Though the road is murky,"
7194,IV,"I am not afraid,"
7195,IV,For a shadow passes
7196,IV,On the lighted shade.
7197,IV,
7198,IV,Once I knew the sesame
7199,IV,To the closed door;
7200,IV,Now I shall not enter
7201,IV,Any more;
7202,IV,
7203,IV,Nor will people passing
7204,IV,"By the lit place,"
7205,IV,See our shadows marry
7206,IV,In a gray embrace.
7207,IV,
7208,IV,Strange a passing shadow
7209,IV,Has a long spell!
7210,IV,"What can matter, knowing"
7211,IV,She does well?
7212,IV,
7213,IV,How can life annoy me
7214,IV,Any more?
7215,IV,Life:  a lighted window
7216,IV,And a closed door.

7221,IV,Doors.  [Hermann Hagedorn]
7222,IV,
7223,IV,
7224,IV,
7225,IV,Like a young child who to his mother's door
7226,IV,"Runs eager for the welcoming embrace,"
7227,IV,"And finds the door shut, and with troubled face"
7228,IV,"Calls and through sobbing calls, and o'er and o'er"
7229,IV,"Calling, storms at the panel -- so before"
7230,IV,"A door that will not open, sick and numb,"
7231,IV,"I listen for a word that will not come,"
7232,IV,"And know, at last, I may not enter more."
7233,IV,
7234,IV,Silence!  And through the silence and the dark
7235,IV,"By that closed door, the distant sob of tears"
7236,IV,"Beats on my spirit, as on fairy shores"
7237,IV,The spectral sea; and through the sobbing -- hark!
7238,IV,"Down the fair-chambered corridor of years,"
7239,IV,"The quiet shutting, one by one, of doors."

7246,IV,

7248,IV,"Where love once was, let there be no hate:"
7249,IV,Though they that went as one by night and day
7250,IV,"Go now alone,"
7251,IV,"Where love once was, let there be no hate."
7252,IV,
7253,IV,The seeds we planted together
7254,IV,"Came to rich harvest,"
7255,IV,And our hearts are as bins brimming with the golden plenty:
7256,IV,Into our loneliness we carry granaries of old love . . .
7257,IV,
7258,IV,"And though the time has come when we cannot sow our acres together,"
7259,IV,"And our souls need diverse fields,"
7260,IV,"And a tilling apart,"
7261,IV,"Let us go separate ways with a blessing each for each,"
7262,IV,"And gentle parting,"
7263,IV,"And let there be no hate,"
7264,IV,Where love once was.

7270,IV,
7271,IV,
7272,IV,
7273,IV,"Well, if the thing is over, better it is for me,"
7274,IV,"The lad was ever a rover, loving and laughing free,"
7275,IV,Far too clever a lover not to be having still
7276,IV,A lass in the town and a lass by the road and a lass by the farther hill --
7277,IV,Love on the field and love on the path and love in the woody glen --
7278,IV,"(Lad, will I never see you, never your face again?)"
7279,IV,
7280,IV,"Ay, if the thing is ending, now I'll be getting rest,"
7281,IV,"Saying my prayers and bending down to be stilled and blest,"
7282,IV,Never the days are sending hope till my heart is sore
7283,IV,For a laugh on the path and a voice by the gate and a step
7284,IV,on the shieling floor --
7285,IV,Grief on my ways and grief on my work and grief till the evening's dim --
7286,IV,"(Lord, will I never hear it, never a sound of him?)"
7287,IV,
7288,IV,"Sure if it's done forever, better for me that's wise,"
7289,IV,"Never the hurt, and never tears in my aching eyes,"
7290,IV,No more the trouble ever to hide from my asking folk
7291,IV,"Beat of my heart at click o' the latch, and throb if his name is spoke;"
7292,IV,"Never the need to hide the sighs and the flushing thoughts and the fret,"
7293,IV,And after awhile my heart will hush and my hungering hands forget . . .
7294,IV,"Peace on my ways, and peace in my step, and maybe my heart grown light --"
7295,IV,"(~Mary, helper of heartbreak, send him to me to-night!~)"

7302,IV,
7303,IV,
7304,IV,"Sleep on -- I lie at heaven's high oriels,"
7305,IV,Over the stars that murmur as they go
7306,IV,Lighting your lattice-window far below;
7307,IV,And every star some of the glory spells
7308,IV,Whereof I know.
7309,IV,"I have forgotten you, long long ago;"
7310,IV,"Like the sweet, silver singing of thin bells"
7311,IV,"Vanished, or music fading faint and low."
7312,IV,"Sleep on -- I lie at heaven's high oriels,"
7313,IV,Who loved you so.

7318,IV,A Nun.  [Odell Shepard]
7319,IV,
7320,IV,
7321,IV,
7322,IV,One glance and I had lost her in the riot
7323,IV,Of tangled cries.
7324,IV,She trod the clamor with a cloistral quiet
7325,IV,Deep in her eyes
7326,IV,As though she heard the muted music only
7327,IV,That silence makes
7328,IV,Among dim mountain summits and on lonely
7329,IV,Deserted lakes.
7330,IV,
7331,IV,There is some broken song her heart remembers
7332,IV,"From long ago,"
7333,IV,"Some love lies buried deep, some passion's embers"
7334,IV,"Smothered in snow,"
7335,IV,Far voices of a joy that sought and missed her
7336,IV,"Fail now, and cease . . ."
7337,IV,And this has given the deep eyes of God's sister
7338,IV,Their dreadful peace.

7343,IV,Silence.  [Edgar Lee Masters]
7344,IV,
7345,IV,
7346,IV,
7347,IV,"I have known the silence of the stars and of the sea,"
7348,IV,"And the silence of the city when it pauses,"
7349,IV,"And the silence of a man and a maid,"
7350,IV,And the silence of the sick
7351,IV,When their eyes roam about the room.
7352,IV,"And I ask:  For the depths,"
7353,IV,Of what use is language?
7354,IV,A beast of the field moans a few times
7355,IV,When death takes its young.
7356,IV,And we are voiceless in the presence of realities --
7357,IV,We cannot speak.
7358,IV,
7359,IV,A curious boy asks an old soldier
7360,IV,"Sitting in front of the grocery store,"
7361,IV,"""How did you lose your leg?"""
7362,IV,"And the old soldier is struck with silence,"
7363,IV,Or his mind flies away
7364,IV,Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg.
7365,IV,It comes back jocosely
7366,IV,"And he says, ""A bear bit it off."""
7367,IV,"And the boy wonders, while the old soldier"
7368,IV,"Dumbly, feebly lives over"
7369,IV,"The flashes of guns, the thunder of cannon,"
7370,IV,"The shrieks of the slain,"
7371,IV,"And himself lying on the ground,"
7372,IV,"And the hospital surgeons, the knives,"
7373,IV,And the long days in bed.
7374,IV,But if he could describe it all
7375,IV,He would be an artist.
7376,IV,But if he were an artist there would be deeper wounds
7377,IV,Which he could not describe.
7378,IV,
7379,IV,"There is the silence of a great hatred,"
7380,IV,"And the silence of a great love,"
7381,IV,And the silence of an embittered friendship.
7382,IV,"There is the silence of a spiritual crisis,"
7383,IV,"Through which your soul, exquisitely tortured,"
7384,IV,Comes with visions not to be uttered
7385,IV,Into a realm of higher life.
7386,IV,There is the silence of defeat.
7387,IV,There is the silence of those unjustly punished;
7388,IV,And the silence of the dying whose hand
7389,IV,Suddenly grips yours.
7390,IV,"There is the silence between father and son,"
7391,IV,"When the father cannot explain his life,"
7392,IV,Even though he be misunderstood for it.
7393,IV,
7394,IV,There is the silence that comes between husband and wife.
7395,IV,There is the silence of those who have failed;
7396,IV,And the vast silence that covers
7397,IV,Broken nations and vanquished leaders.
7398,IV,"There is the silence of Lincoln,"
7399,IV,Thinking of the poverty of his youth.
7400,IV,And the silence of Napoleon
7401,IV,After Waterloo.
7402,IV,And the silence of Jeanne d'Arc
7403,IV,"Saying amid the flames, ""Blessed Jesus"" --"
7404,IV,"Revealing in two words all sorrows, all hope."
7405,IV,"And there is the silence of age,"
7406,IV,Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it
7407,IV,In words intelligible to those who have not lived
7408,IV,The great range of life.
7409,IV,
7410,IV,And there is the silence of the dead.
7411,IV,If we who are in life cannot speak
7412,IV,"Of profound experiences,"
7413,IV,Why do you marvel that the dead
7414,IV,Do not tell you of death?
7415,IV,Their silence shall be interpreted
7416,IV,As we approach them.

7423,IV,
7424,IV,
7425,IV,I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover:
7426,IV,My arms shall welcome you when other arms are tired;
7427,IV,"I stand to wait for you, patient in the darkness,"
7428,IV,Offering forgetfulness of all that you desired.
7429,IV,
7430,IV,"I ask no merriment, no pretense of gladness,"
7431,IV,I can love heavy lids and lips without their rose;
7432,IV,Though you are sorrowful you will not weary me;
7433,IV,I will not go from you when all the tired world goes.
7434,IV,
7435,IV,I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover;
7436,IV,I promise faithfulness no other lips may keep;
7437,IV,"Safe in my bridal place, comforted by darkness,"
7438,IV,"You shall lie happily, smiling in your sleep."

7451,IV,"In the brown grasses slanting with the wind,"
7452,IV,"Lone as a lad whose dog's no longer near,"
7453,IV,"Lone as a mother whose only child has sinned,"
7454,IV,Lone on the loved hill . . . and below me here
7455,IV,The thistle-down in tremulous atmosphere
7456,IV,Along red clusters of the sumach streams;
7457,IV,"The shrivelled stalks of golden-rod are sere,"
7458,IV,And crisp and white their flashing old racemes.
7459,IV,(. . . forever . . . forever . . . . forever . . .)

7465,IV,The corn-shocks westward on the stubble plain
7466,IV,Show like an Indian village of dead days;
7467,IV,"The long smoke trails behind the crawling train,"
7468,IV,And floats atop the distant woods ablaze
7469,IV,"With orange, crimson, purple.  The low haze"
7470,IV,"Dims the scarped bluffs above the inland sea,"
7471,IV,Whose wide and slaty waters in cold glaze
7472,IV,"Await yon full-moon of the night-to-be,"
7473,IV,(. . . far . . . and far . . . and far . . .)

7480,IV,"And this the hill she lingered on, as bride --"

7482,IV,They laid her . . . in no evening autumn tide . . .
7483,IV,"Under fresh flowers of that May morn, beside"

7485,IV,
7486,IV,"This is the hill . . . and over my city's towers,"
7487,IV,"Across the world from sunset, yonder in air,"
7488,IV,"Shines, through its scaffoldings, a civic dome"
7489,IV,"Of piled masonry, which shall be ours"

7491,IV,And yonder far roof of my abandoned home
7492,IV,Shall house new laughter . . .  Yet I tried . . . I tried
7493,IV,"And, ever wistful of the doom to come,"
7494,IV,I built her many a fire for love . . . for mirth . . .

7505,IV,
7506,IV,
7507,IV,
7508,IV,"Death is like moonlight in a lofty wood,"
7509,IV,That pours pale magic through the shadowy leaves;
7510,IV,'T is like the web that some old perfume weaves
7511,IV,"In a dim, lonely room where memories brood;"
7512,IV,"Like snow-chilled wine it steals into the blood,"
7513,IV,Spurring the pulse its coolness half reprieves;
7514,IV,"Tenderly quickening impulses it gives,"
7515,IV,As April winds unsheathe an opening bud.
7516,IV,
7517,IV,"Death is like all sweet, sense-enfolding things,"
7518,IV,That lift us in a dream-delicious trance
7519,IV,Beyond the flickering good and ill of chance;
7520,IV,"But most is Death like Music's buoyant wings,"
7521,IV,"That bear the soul, a willing Ganymede,"
7522,IV,Where joys on joys forevermore succeed.

7534,IV,And foiled oblivion.

7536,IV,"But this indifferent clay,"
7537,IV,"This fine experienced hand,"
7538,IV,"So quiet, and these thoughts"
7539,IV,"That all unfinished stand,"
7540,IV,

7553,IV,"By the fond name that was his own and mine,"
7554,IV,"The last upon his lips that strove with doom,"
7555,IV,He called me and I saw the light assume
7556,IV,A sudden glory and around him shine;
7557,IV,And nearer now I saw the laureled line
7558,IV,"Of the august of Song before me loom,"
7559,IV,"And knew the voices, erstwhile through the gloom,"
7560,IV,That whispered and forbade me to repine.
7561,IV,"And with farewell, a shaft of splendor sank"
7562,IV,"Out of the stars and faded as a flame,"
7563,IV,"And down the night, on clouds of glory, came"
7564,IV,The battle seraphs halting rank on rank;
7565,IV,"And lifted heavenward to heroic peace,"

7578,IV,There shall I find you waiting when the flown
7579,IV,Dream leaves my heart insentient as the clod;
7580,IV,And when the grief-retracing ways I trod
7581,IV,"Become a shining path to thee alone,"
7582,IV,"My weary feet, that seemed to drag as stone,"
7583,IV,"Shall once again, with wings of fleetness shod,"
7584,IV,"Fare on, beloved, to find you!  Just beyond"

7600,IV,"And awed embarkings on an unshored sea,"
7601,IV,And sudden disarrangement of the years.
7602,IV,But now I know that nothing interferes
7603,IV,With the fixed forces when a tired man dies;
7604,IV,"That death is only answerings and replies,"
7605,IV,"The chiming of a bell which no one hears,"
7606,IV,"The casual slanting of a half-spent sun,"
7607,IV,"The soft recessional of noise and coil,"
7608,IV,The coveted something time nor age can spoil;
7609,IV,I know it is a fabric finely spun
7610,IV,"Between the stars and dark; to seize and keep,"

7623,IV,To tell where she would hide.
7624,IV,
7625,IV,"To keep a sudden rendezvous,"
7626,IV,It came into her mind
7627,IV,That she was late.  What could she do

7629,IV,
7630,IV,"Afraid of being in disgrace,"
7631,IV,"And hurrying to dress,"
7632,IV,She heard there was another place

7634,IV,
7635,IV,"She went so softly and so soon,"
