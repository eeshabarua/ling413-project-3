57,A FOREWORD,
58,A FOREWORD,"When the first Miscellany of American Poetry appeared in 1920,"
59,A FOREWORD,innumerable were the questions asked by both readers and reviewers of
60,A FOREWORD,publishers and contributors alike. The modest note on the jacket
61,A FOREWORD,"appeared to satisfy no one. The volume purported to have no editor, yet"
62,A FOREWORD,a collection without an editor was pronounced preposterous. It was
63,A FOREWORD,"obviously not the organ of a school, yet it did not seem to have been"
64,A FOREWORD,compiled to exploit any particular phase of American life; neither
65,A FOREWORD,"Nature, Love, Patriotism, Propaganda, nor Philosophy could be acclaimed"
66,A FOREWORD,"as its reason for being, and it was certainly not intended, as has been"
67,A FOREWORD,"so frequent of late, to bring a cheerful absence of mind to the"
68,A FOREWORD,"world-weary during an unoccupied ten minutes. Again, it was exclusive"
69,A FOREWORD,"not inclusive, since its object was, evidently, not the meritorious if"
70,A FOREWORD,impossible one of attempting to be a compendium of present-day American
71,A FOREWORD,verse.
72,A FOREWORD,
73,A FOREWORD,"But the publisher's note had stated one thing quite clearly, that the"
74,A FOREWORD,"Miscellany was to be a biennial. Two years have passed, and with the"
75,A FOREWORD,second volume it has seemed best to state at once the reasons which
76,A FOREWORD,actuated its contributors to join in such a venture.
77,A FOREWORD,
78,A FOREWORD,"In the first place, the plan of the _Miscellany_ is frankly imitative."
79,A FOREWORD,For some years now there has been published in England an anthology
80,A FOREWORD,entitled Georgian Poetry. The Miscellany is intended to be an American
81,A FOREWORD,"companion to that publication. The dissimilarities of temperament, range"
82,A FOREWORD,"and choice of subjects are manifest, but the outstanding difference is"
83,A FOREWORD,"this: _Georgian Poetry_ has an editor, and the poems it contains may be"
84,A FOREWORD,taken as that editor's reaction to the poetry of the day. The
85,A FOREWORD,"_Miscellany_, on the other hand, has no editor; it is no one person's"
86,A FOREWORD,choice which forms it; it is not an attempt to throw into relief any
87,A FOREWORD,particular group or stress any particular tendency. It does disclose the
88,A FOREWORD,most recent work of certain representative figures in contemporary
89,A FOREWORD,American literature. The poets who appear here have come together by
90,A FOREWORD,"mutual accord and, although they may invite others to join them in"
91,A FOREWORD,"subsequent volumes as circumstance dictates, each one stands (as all"
92,A FOREWORD,newcomers also must stand) as the exponent of fresh and strikingly
93,A FOREWORD,diverse qualities in our native poetry. It is as if a dozen unacademic
94,A FOREWORD,"painters, separated by temperament and distance, were to arrange to have"
95,A FOREWORD,an exhibition every two years of their latest work. They would not
96,A FOREWORD,pretend that they were the only painters worthy of a public showing;
97,A FOREWORD,"they would maintain that their work was, generally speaking, most"
98,A FOREWORD,interesting to one another. Their gallery would necessarily be limited;
99,A FOREWORD,"but it would be flexible enough to admit, with every fresh exhibit,"
100,A FOREWORD,three or four new members who had achieved an importance and an idiom
101,A FOREWORD,of their own. This is just what the original contributors to the
102,A FOREWORD,_Miscellany_ have done.
103,A FOREWORD,
104,A FOREWORD,"The newcomers--H. D., Alfred Kreymborg, and Edna St. Vincent"
105,A FOREWORD,Millay--have taken their places with the same absence of judge or jury
106,A FOREWORD,"that marks any ""society of independents."" There is no hanging committee;"
107,A FOREWORD,"no organizer of ""position."" Two years ago the alphabet determined the"
108,A FOREWORD,arrangement; this time seniority has been the sole arbiter of
109,A FOREWORD,precedence. Furthermore--and this can not be too often repeated--there
110,A FOREWORD,"has been no editor. To be painstakingly precise, each contributor has"
111,A FOREWORD,"been his own editor. As such, he has chosen his own selections and"
112,A FOREWORD,"determined the order in which they are to be printed, but he has had no"
113,A FOREWORD,authority over either the choice or grouping of his fellow exhibitors'
114,A FOREWORD,contributions. To one of the members has been delegated the merely
115,A FOREWORD,"mechanical labors of assembling, proof-reading, and seeing the volume"
116,A FOREWORD,through the press. The absence of E. A. Robinson from this year's
117,A FOREWORD,_Miscellany_ is a source of regret not only to all the contributors but
118,A FOREWORD,to the poet himself. Mr. Robinson has written nothing since his
119,A FOREWORD,Collected Poems with the exception of a long poem--a volume in
120,A FOREWORD,itself--but he hopes to appear in any subsequent collection.
121,A FOREWORD,
122,A FOREWORD,It should be added that this is not a haphazard anthology of picked-over
123,A FOREWORD,poetry. The poems that follow are new. They are new not only in the
124,A FOREWORD,"sense that (with two exceptions) they cannot be found in book form, but"
125,A FOREWORD,most of them have never previously been published. Certain of the
126,A FOREWORD,selections have appeared in recent magazines and these are reprinted by
127,A FOREWORD,"permission of _The Century_, _The Yale Review_, _Poetry: A Magazine of"
128,A FOREWORD,"Verse_, _The New Republic_, _Harper's_, _Scribner's_, _The Bookman_,"
129,A FOREWORD,"_The Freeman_, _Broom_, _The Dial_, _The Atlantic Monthly_, _Farm and"
130,A FOREWORD,"Fireside_, _The Measure_, and _The Literary Review_. Vachel Lindsay's ""I"
131,A FOREWORD,"Know All This When Gipsy Fiddles Cry"" is a revised version of the poem"
132,A FOREWORD,of that name which was printed in _The Enchanted Years_.

331,LILACS,Your great puffs of flowers
332,LILACS,Are everywhere in this my New England.
333,LILACS,Among your heart-shaped leaves
334,LILACS,Orange orioles hop like music-box birds and sing
335,LILACS,Their little weak soft songs;
336,LILACS,In the crooks of your branches
337,LILACS,The bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted eggs
338,LILACS,Peer restlessly through the light and shadow
339,LILACS,Of all Springs.
340,LILACS,Lilacs in dooryards
341,LILACS,Holding quiet conversations with an early moon;
342,LILACS,Lilacs watching a deserted house
343,LILACS,Settling sideways into the grass of an old road;
344,LILACS,"Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of bloom"
345,LILACS,Above a cellar dug into a hill.
346,LILACS,You are everywhere.
347,LILACS,You were everywhere.
348,LILACS,"You tapped the window when the preacher preached his sermon,"
349,LILACS,And ran along the road beside the boy going to school.
350,LILACS,"You stood by pasture-bars to give the cows good milking,"
351,LILACS,You persuaded the housewife that her dish-pan was of silver
352,LILACS,And her husband an image of pure gold.
353,LILACS,You flaunted the fragrance of your blossoms
354,LILACS,Through the wide doors of Custom Houses--
355,LILACS,"You, and sandal-wood, and tea,"
356,LILACS,Charging the noses of quill-driving clerks
357,LILACS,When a ship was in from China.
358,LILACS,"You called to them: ""Goose-quill men, goose-quill men,"
359,LILACS,"May is a month for flitting,"""
360,LILACS,Until they writhed on their high stools
361,LILACS,And wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up
362,LILACS,ledgers.
363,LILACS,"Paradoxical New England clerks,"
364,LILACS,"Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the ""Song of Solomon"" at"

366,LILACS,"So many verses before bedtime,"
367,LILACS,Because it was the Bible.
368,LILACS,The dead fed you
369,LILACS,Amid the slant stones of graveyards.
370,LILACS,Pale ghosts who planted you
371,LILACS,Came in the night time
372,LILACS,And let their thin hair blow through your clustered stems.
373,LILACS,"You are of the green sea,"
374,LILACS,And of the stone hills which reach a long distance.
375,LILACS,You are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell
376,LILACS,"kites and marbles,"
377,LILACS,You are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at home.
378,LILACS,You cover the blind sides of greenhouses
379,LILACS,And lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the glass
380,LILACS,"To your friends, the grapes, inside."
381,LILACS,
382,LILACS,"Lilacs,"

388,LILACS,"The veiled women with eyes like panthers,"
389,LILACS,"The swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled Pashas."
390,LILACS,"Now you are a very decent flower,"
391,LILACS,"A reticent flower,"
392,LILACS,"A curiously clear-cut, candid flower,"
393,LILACS,"Standing beside clean doorways,"
394,LILACS,"Friendly to a house-cat and a pair of spectacles,"
395,LILACS,Making poetry out of a bit of moonlight
396,LILACS,And a hundred or two sharp blossoms.
397,LILACS,
398,LILACS,"Maine knows you,"
399,LILACS,Has for years and years;
400,LILACS,"New Hampshire knows you,"
401,LILACS,And Massachusetts
402,LILACS,And Vermont.
403,LILACS,Cape Cod starts you along the beaches to Rhode Island;
404,LILACS,Connecticut takes you from a river to the sea.
405,LILACS,"You are brighter than apples,"
406,LILACS,"Sweeter than tulips,"
407,LILACS,You are the great flood of our souls
408,LILACS,"Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our hearts,"
409,LILACS,"You are the smell of all Summers,"
410,LILACS,"The love of wives and children,"
411,LILACS,"The recollection of the gardens of little children,"
412,LILACS,You are State Houses and Charters
413,LILACS,And the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it knows.
414,LILACS,"May is lilac here in New England,"
415,LILACS,"May is a thrush singing ""Sun up!"" on a tip-top ash-tree,"
416,LILACS,May is white clouds behind pine-trees
417,LILACS,Puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.
418,LILACS,"May is a green as no other,"
419,LILACS,"May is much sun through small leaves,"
420,LILACS,"May is soft earth,"
421,LILACS,"And apple-blossoms,"
422,LILACS,And windows open to a South wind.
423,LILACS,May is a full light wind of lilac
424,LILACS,From Canada to Narragansett Bay.

434,LILACS,"Because my roots are in it,"
435,LILACS,"Because my leaves are of it,"
436,LILACS,"Because my flowers are for it,"
437,LILACS,Because it is my country

440,LILACS,Since certainly it is mine.

622,THE SWANS,Along the moat
623,THE SWANS,"Around the Bishop's garden,"
624,THE SWANS,And the white clouds push
625,THE SWANS,Across a blue sky
626,THE SWANS,With edges that seem to draw in and harden.
627,THE SWANS,
628,THE SWANS,Two slim men of white bronze
629,THE SWANS,Beat each with a hammer on the end of a rod
630,THE SWANS,The hours of God.
631,THE SWANS,"Striking a bell,"
632,THE SWANS,They do it well.
633,THE SWANS,"And the echoes jump, and tinkle, and swell"
634,THE SWANS,In the Cathedral's carved stone polygons.
635,THE SWANS,
636,THE SWANS,The swans float
637,THE SWANS,"About the moat,"
638,THE SWANS,And another swan sits still in the air
639,THE SWANS,Above the old inn.
640,THE SWANS,He gazes into the street
641,THE SWANS,"And swims the cold and the heat,"
642,THE SWANS,"He has always been there,"
643,THE SWANS,At least so say the cobbles in the square.
644,THE SWANS,They listen to the beat
645,THE SWANS,"Of the hammered bell,"
646,THE SWANS,And think of the feet
647,THE SWANS,Which beat upon their tops;
648,THE SWANS,But what they think they do not tell.
649,THE SWANS,
650,THE SWANS,And the swans who float
651,THE SWANS,Up and down the moat
652,THE SWANS,Gobble the bread the Bishop feeds them.
653,THE SWANS,"The slim bronze men beat the hour again,"
654,THE SWANS,But only the gargoyles up in the hard blue air heed them.
655,THE SWANS,
656,THE SWANS,"When the Bishop says a prayer,"
657,THE SWANS,"And the choir sing ""Amen,"""
658,THE SWANS,The hammers break in on them there:
659,THE SWANS,Clang! Clang! Beware! Beware!
660,THE SWANS,"The carved swan looks down at the passing men,"
661,THE SWANS,"And the cobbles wink: ""An hour has gone again."""
662,THE SWANS,But the people kneeling before the Bishop's chair
663,THE SWANS,Forget the passing over the cobbles in the square.
664,THE SWANS,
665,THE SWANS,"An hour of day and an hour of night,"
666,THE SWANS,And the clouds float away in a red-splashed light.
667,THE SWANS,"The sun, quotha? or white, white"
668,THE SWANS,Smoke with fire all alight.
669,THE SWANS,
670,THE SWANS,"An old roof crashing on a Bishop's tomb,"
671,THE SWANS,"Swarms of men with a thirst for room,"
672,THE SWANS,"And the footsteps blur to a shower, shower, shower,"
673,THE SWANS,"Of men passing--passing--every hour,"
674,THE SWANS,"With arms of power, and legs of power,"
675,THE SWANS,"And power in their strong, hard minds."
676,THE SWANS,No need then
677,THE SWANS,For the slim bronze men
678,THE SWANS,"Who beat God's hours: Prime, Tierce, None."
679,THE SWANS,Who wants to hear? No one.
680,THE SWANS,"We will melt them, and mold them,"
681,THE SWANS,And make them a stem
682,THE SWANS,"For a banner gorged with blood,"
683,THE SWANS,For a blue-mouthed torch.
684,THE SWANS,"So the men rush like clouds,"
685,THE SWANS,They strike their iron edges on the Bishop's chair
686,THE SWANS,And fling down the lanterns by the tower stair.
687,THE SWANS,They rip the Bishop out of his tomb
688,THE SWANS,And break the mitre off of his head.
689,THE SWANS,"""See,"" say they, ""the man is dead;"
690,THE SWANS,He cannot shiver or sing.
691,THE SWANS,"We'll toss for his ring."""

693,THE SWANS,The cobbles see this all along the street
694,THE SWANS,Coming--coming--on countless feet.
695,THE SWANS,And the clockmen mark the hours as they go.
696,THE SWANS,But slow--slow--
697,THE SWANS,The swans float
698,THE SWANS,In the Bishop's moat.
699,THE SWANS,And the inn swan
700,THE SWANS,"Sits on and on,"
701,THE SWANS,Staring before him with cold glass eyes.
702,THE SWANS,"Only the Bishop walks serene,"
703,THE SWANS,"Pleased with his church, pleased with his house,"
704,THE SWANS,"Pleased with the sound of the hammered bell,"
705,THE SWANS,Beating his doom.
706,THE SWANS,"Saying ""Boom! Boom! Room! Room!"""
707,THE SWANS,"He is old, and kind, and deaf, and blind,"
708,THE SWANS,"And very, very pleased with his charming moat"
709,THE SWANS,And the swans which float.

867,THE GRINDSTONE,
868,THE GRINDSTONE,
869,THE GRINDSTONE,Having a wheel and four legs of its own
870,THE GRINDSTONE,Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone
871,THE GRINDSTONE,To get it anywhere that I can see.
872,THE GRINDSTONE,These hands have helped it go and even race;
873,THE GRINDSTONE,"Not all the motion, though, they ever lent,"
874,THE GRINDSTONE,"Not all the miles it may have thought it went,"
875,THE GRINDSTONE,Have got it one step from the starting place.
876,THE GRINDSTONE,It stands beside the same old apple tree.
877,THE GRINDSTONE,The shadow of the apple tree is thin
878,THE GRINDSTONE,Upon it now; its feet are fast in snow.
879,THE GRINDSTONE,"All other farm machinery's gone in,"
880,THE GRINDSTONE,And some of it on no more legs and wheel
881,THE GRINDSTONE,Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go.
882,THE GRINDSTONE,(I'm thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.)
883,THE GRINDSTONE,"For months it hasn't known the taste of steel,"
884,THE GRINDSTONE,Washed down with rusty water in a tin.
885,THE GRINDSTONE,"But standing outdoors, hungry, in the cold,"
886,THE GRINDSTONE,"Except in towns, at night, is not a sin."
887,THE GRINDSTONE,"And, anyway, its standing in the yard"
888,THE GRINDSTONE,Under a ruinous live apple tree
889,THE GRINDSTONE,"Has nothing any more to do with me,"
890,THE GRINDSTONE,"Except that I remember how of old,"
891,THE GRINDSTONE,"One summer day, all day I drove it hard,"
892,THE GRINDSTONE,"And some one mounted on it rode it hard,"
893,THE GRINDSTONE,And he and I between us ground a blade.
894,THE GRINDSTONE,
895,THE GRINDSTONE,"I gave it the preliminary spin,"
896,THE GRINDSTONE,And poured on water (tears it might have been);
897,THE GRINDSTONE,"And when it almost gayly jumped and flowed,"
898,THE GRINDSTONE,"A Father-Time-like man got on and rode,"
899,THE GRINDSTONE,Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed.
900,THE GRINDSTONE,He turned on will-power to increase the load
901,THE GRINDSTONE,"And slow me down--and I abruptly slowed,"
902,THE GRINDSTONE,Like coming to a sudden railroad station.
903,THE GRINDSTONE,I changed from hand to hand in desperation.
904,THE GRINDSTONE,
905,THE GRINDSTONE,I wondered what machine of ages gone
906,THE GRINDSTONE,This represented an improvement on.
907,THE GRINDSTONE,For all I knew it may have sharpened spears
908,THE GRINDSTONE,And arrowheads itself. Much use for years
909,THE GRINDSTONE,Had gradually worn it an oblate
910,THE GRINDSTONE,"Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait,"
911,THE GRINDSTONE,Appearing to return me hate for hate.
912,THE GRINDSTONE,(But I forgive it now as easily
913,THE GRINDSTONE,As any other boyhood enemy
914,THE GRINDSTONE,Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere.)
915,THE GRINDSTONE,I wondered who it was the man thought ground--
916,THE GRINDSTONE,The one who held the wheel back or the one
917,THE GRINDSTONE,Who gave his life to keep it going round?
918,THE GRINDSTONE,I wondered if he really thought it fair
919,THE GRINDSTONE,For him to have the say when we were done.
920,THE GRINDSTONE,Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned.
921,THE GRINDSTONE,
922,THE GRINDSTONE,Not for myself was I so much concerned.
923,THE GRINDSTONE,"Oh, no!--although, of course, I could have found"
924,THE GRINDSTONE,A better way to pass the afternoon
925,THE GRINDSTONE,"Than grinding discord out of a grindstone,"
926,THE GRINDSTONE,And beating insects at their gritty tune.
927,THE GRINDSTONE,Nor was I for the man so much concerned.
928,THE GRINDSTONE,Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing
929,THE GRINDSTONE,It looked as if he might be badly thrown
930,THE GRINDSTONE,"And wounded on his blade. So far from caring,"
931,THE GRINDSTONE,"I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster,"
932,THE GRINDSTONE,(It ran as if it wasn't greased but glued);
933,THE GRINDSTONE,I welcomed any moderate disaster
934,THE GRINDSTONE,That might be calculated to postpone
935,THE GRINDSTONE,What evidently nothing could conclude.
936,THE GRINDSTONE,
937,THE GRINDSTONE,The thing that made me more and more afraid
938,THE GRINDSTONE,"Was that we'd ground it sharp and hadn't known,"
939,THE GRINDSTONE,And now were only wasting precious blade.
940,THE GRINDSTONE,And when he raised it dripping once and tried
941,THE GRINDSTONE,"The creepy edge of it with wary touch,"
942,THE GRINDSTONE,"And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed,"
943,THE GRINDSTONE,Only disinterestedly to decide
944,THE GRINDSTONE,"It needed a turn more, I could have cried"
945,THE GRINDSTONE,Wasn't there danger of a turn too much?
946,THE GRINDSTONE,Mightn't we make it worse instead of better?
947,THE GRINDSTONE,I was for leaving something to the whetter.
948,THE GRINDSTONE,What if it wasn't all it should be? I'd
949,THE GRINDSTONE,Be satisfied if he'd be satisfied.

955,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
956,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_Circa 1922_
957,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
958,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
959,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I staid the night for shelter at a farm
960,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Behind the mountain, with a mother and son,"
961,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Two old-believers. They did all the talking.
962,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
963,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
964,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits
965,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"She _could_ call up to pass a winter evening,"
966,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"But _won't_, should be burned at the stake or something."
967,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Summoning spirits isn't ""Button, button,"
968,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Who's got the button?"" I'd have you understand."
969,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
970,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Son_
971,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Mother can make a common table rear
972,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And kick with two legs like an army mule.
973,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
974,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
975,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"And when I've done it, what good have I done?"
976,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Rather than tip a table for you, let me"
977,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me.
978,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him"
979,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"How that could be--I thought the dead were souls,"
980,THE WITCH OF COÖS,He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious
981,THE WITCH OF COÖS,That there's something the dead are keeping back?
982,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back."
983,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
984,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Son_
985,THE WITCH OF COÖS,You wouldn't want to tell him what we have
986,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Up attic, mother?"
987,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
988,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
989,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Bones--a skeleton.
990,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
991,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Son_
992,THE WITCH OF COÖS,But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed
993,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Against the attic door: the door is nailed.
994,THE WITCH OF COÖS,It's harmless. Mother hears it in the night
995,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Halting perplexed behind the barrier
996,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get
997,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Is back into the cellar where it came from.
998,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
999,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
1000,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"We'll never let them, will we, son? We'll never!"
1001,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1002,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Son_
1003,THE WITCH OF COÖS,It left the cellar forty years ago
1004,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And carried itself like a pile of dishes
1005,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen,"
1006,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Another from the kitchen to the bedroom,"
1007,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Another from the bedroom to the attic,"
1008,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped it."
1009,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs.
1010,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I was a baby: I don't know where I was.
1011,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1012,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
1013,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The only fault my husband found with me--
1014,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I went to sleep before I went to bed,"
1015,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Especially in winter when the bed
1016,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.
1017,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs
1018,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,"
1019,THE WITCH OF COÖS,But left an open door to cool the room off
1020,THE WITCH OF COÖS,So as to sort of turn me out of it.
1021,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I was just coming to myself enough
1022,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"To wonder where the cold was coming from,"
1023,THE WITCH OF COÖS,When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom
1024,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.
1025,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on
1026,THE WITCH OF COÖS,When there was water in the cellar in spring
1027,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then some one
1028,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,"
1029,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"The way a man with one leg and a crutch,"
1030,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Or little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:"
1031,THE WITCH OF COÖS,It wasn't any one who could be there.
1032,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked
1033,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And swollen tight and buried under snow.
1034,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust
1035,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And swollen tight and buried under snow.
1036,THE WITCH OF COÖS,It was the bones. I knew them--and good reason.
1037,THE WITCH OF COÖS,My first impulse was to get to the knob
1038,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And hold the door. But the bones didn't try
1039,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"The door; they halted helpless on the landing,"
1040,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Waiting for things to happen in their favor.
1041,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.
1042,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I never could have done the thing I did
1043,THE WITCH OF COÖS,If the wish hadn't been too strong in me
1044,THE WITCH OF COÖS,To see how they were mounted for this walk.
1045,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I had a vision of them put together
1046,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Not like a man, but like a chandelier."
1047,THE WITCH OF COÖS,So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.
1048,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"A moment he stood balancing with emotion,"
1049,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire
1050,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.
1051,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)
1052,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,"
1053,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The way he did in life once; but this time
1054,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,"
1055,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And fell back from him on the floor myself.
1056,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The finger-pieces slid in all directions.
1057,THE WITCH OF COÖS,(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?
1058,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Hand me my button-box--it must be there.)
1059,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I sat up on the floor and shouted, ""Toffile,"
1060,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"It's coming up to you."" It had its choice"
1061,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Of the door to the cellar or the hall.
1062,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"It took the hall door for the novelty,"
1063,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"And set off briskly for so slow a thing,"
1064,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Still going every which way in the joints, though,"
1065,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,"
1066,THE WITCH OF COÖS,From the slap I had just now given its hand.
1067,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I listened till it almost climbed the stairs
1068,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"From the hall to the only finished bedroom,"
1069,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Before I got up to do anything;
1070,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Then ran and shouted, ""Shut the bedroom door,"
1071,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile, for my sake!"" ""Company,"" he said,"
1072,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed."""
1073,THE WITCH OF COÖS,So lying forward weakly on the handrail
1074,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light"
1075,THE WITCH OF COÖS,(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own
1076,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"I could see nothing. ""Toffile, I don't see it."
1077,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"It's with us in the room, though. It's the bones."""
1078,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""What bones?"" ""The cellar bones--out of the grave."""
1079,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1080,THE WITCH OF COÖS,*     *     *     *     *
1081,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1082,THE WITCH OF COÖS,That made him throw his bare legs out of bed
1083,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And sit up by me and take hold of me.
1084,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I wanted to put out the light and see
1085,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"If I could see it, or else mow the room,"
1086,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"With our arms at the level of our knees,"
1087,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"And bring the chalk-pile down. ""I'll tell you what--"
1088,THE WITCH OF COÖS,It's looking for another door to try.
1089,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The uncommonly deep snow has made him think
1090,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Of his old song, _The Wild Colonial Boy_,"
1091,THE WITCH OF COÖS,He always used to sing along the tote-road.
1092,THE WITCH OF COÖS,He's after an open door to get out-doors.
1093,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Let's trap him with an open door up attic."""
1094,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,"
1095,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Almost the moment he was given an opening,"
1096,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The steps began to climb the attic stairs.
1097,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.
1098,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""Quick!"" I slammed to the door and held the knob."
1099,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"""Toffile, get nails."" I made him nail the door shut,"
1100,THE WITCH OF COÖS,And push the headboard of the bed against it.
1101,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1102,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Then we asked was there anything
1103,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Up attic that we'd ever want again.
1104,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The attic was less to us than the cellar.
1105,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"If the bones liked the attic, let them like it,"
1106,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Let them _stay_ in the attic. When they sometimes
1107,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed
1108,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Behind the door and headboard of the bed,"
1109,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,"
1110,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,"
1111,THE WITCH OF COÖS,That's what I sit up in the dark to say--
1112,THE WITCH OF COÖS,To no one any more since Toffile died.
1113,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Let them stay in the attic since they went there.
1114,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I promised Toffile to be cruel to them
1115,THE WITCH OF COÖS,For helping them be cruel once to him.
1116,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1117,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Son_
1118,THE WITCH OF COÖS,We think they had a grave down in the cellar.
1119,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1120,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
1121,THE WITCH OF COÖS,We know they had a grave down in the cellar.
1122,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1123,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Son_
1124,THE WITCH OF COÖS,We never could find out whose bones they were.
1125,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1126,THE WITCH OF COÖS,_The Mother_
1127,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once."
1128,THE WITCH OF COÖS,They were a man's his father killed for me.
1129,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I mean a man he killed instead of me.
1130,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The least I could do was to help dig their grave.
1131,THE WITCH OF COÖS,We were about it one night in the cellar.
1132,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him
1133,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"To tell the truth, suppose the time had come."
1134,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Son looks surprised to see me end a lie
1135,THE WITCH OF COÖS,We'd kept up all these years between ourselves
1136,THE WITCH OF COÖS,So as to have it ready for outsiders.
1137,THE WITCH OF COÖS,But to-night I don't care enough to lie--
1138,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I don't remember why I ever cared.
1139,THE WITCH OF COÖS,"Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe"
1140,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Could tell you why he ever cared himself....
1141,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1142,THE WITCH OF COÖS,She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted
1143,THE WITCH OF COÖS,Among the buttons poured out in her lap.
1144,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1145,THE WITCH OF COÖS,I verified the name next morning: Toffile;
1146,THE WITCH OF COÖS,The rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway.
1147,THE WITCH OF COÖS,
1148,THE WITCH OF COÖS,

1151,A BROOK IN THE CITY,A BROOK IN THE CITY
1152,A BROOK IN THE CITY,
1153,A BROOK IN THE CITY,
1154,A BROOK IN THE CITY,"The farm house lingers, though averse to square"
1155,A BROOK IN THE CITY,With the new city street it has to wear
1156,A BROOK IN THE CITY,A number in. But what about the brook
1157,A BROOK IN THE CITY,That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
1158,A BROOK IN THE CITY,"I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength"
1159,A BROOK IN THE CITY,"And impulse, having dipped a finger-length"
1160,A BROOK IN THE CITY,"And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed"
1161,A BROOK IN THE CITY,A flower to try its currents where they crossed.
1162,A BROOK IN THE CITY,The meadow grass could be cemented down
1163,A BROOK IN THE CITY,From growing under pavements of a town;
1164,A BROOK IN THE CITY,The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.
1165,A BROOK IN THE CITY,Is water wood to serve a brook the same?
1166,A BROOK IN THE CITY,How else dispose of an immortal force
1167,A BROOK IN THE CITY,No longer needed? Staunch it at its source
1168,A BROOK IN THE CITY,With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown
1169,A BROOK IN THE CITY,Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
1170,A BROOK IN THE CITY,In fetid darkness still to live and run--
1171,A BROOK IN THE CITY,And all for nothing it had ever done
1172,A BROOK IN THE CITY,Except forget to go in fear perhaps.
1173,A BROOK IN THE CITY,No one would know except for ancient maps

2192,PEASANT,"before he speaks,"
2193,PEASANT,like a cow
2194,PEASANT,before she crops.
2195,PEASANT,He bends to the habit
2196,PEASANT,of dragging his feet
2197,PEASANT,"up under him,"
2198,PEASANT,like a measuring-worm:
2199,PEASANT,"some of his forefathers,"
2200,PEASANT,"stooped over books,"
2201,PEASANT,ruled short straight lines
2202,PEASANT,under two rows of figures
2203,PEASANT,to keep their thin savings
2204,PEASANT,from sifting to the floor.
2205,PEASANT,Should you strike him

2212,PEASANT,There is mighty little flesh

2214,PEASANT,there is no gusto
2215,PEASANT,in his stride:

2221,PEASANT,"There is no land,"
2222,PEASANT,"no house,"
2223,PEASANT,"no barn,"
2224,PEASANT,he has ever owned;
2225,PEASANT,he sits uncomfortable
2226,PEASANT,on chairs
2227,PEASANT,you might invite him to:
2228,PEASANT,"if you did,"
2229,PEASANT,he'd keep his hat in hand
2230,PEASANT,against the moment
2231,PEASANT,when some silent pause
2232,PEASANT,for which he hearkens
2233,PEASANT,with his ear to one side
2234,PEASANT,bids him move on--
2235,PEASANT,move on where?
2236,PEASANT,It doesn't matter.
2237,PEASANT,He has learned
2238,PEASANT,"to shrug his shoulders,"
2239,PEASANT,so he'll shrug his shoulders now:
2240,PEASANT,caterpillars do it
2241,PEASANT,when they're halted by a stick.
2242,PEASANT,Is there a sky overhead?--
2243,PEASANT,a hope worth flying to?--

2649,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,"Words were my shelter, words my one escape,"
2650,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,Words were my weapons against everything.

2653,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,My song of battle: Words like flaming stars

2662,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,Ha--you observe me passionate. I aim
2663,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,To curb these wild emotions lest they soar
2664,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,Or drive against my will. (So I have said
2665,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,These many years--and still they are not tame.)
2666,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,Scraps of a song keep rumbling in my head ...
2667,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,Listen--you never heard me sing before.
2668,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,
2669,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,When a false world betrays your trust

2673,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,
2674,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,How quickly the heroic mood

2683,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,Religion or morphine or poultices--God knows.
2684,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,I sometimes have a sentimental lapse
2685,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,And long for saviours and a physical God.

2708,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,
2709,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,To be eternal--what a brilliant thought!
2710,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,It must have been conceived and coddled first

2718,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,"Pipe, breath and summer never going out--"
2719,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,To vegetate through all eternity ...
2720,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,But no such everlastingness for me!

2722,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,
2723,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,"_Death, it is but the long, cool night,"

2736,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,"I saw a dog, a little pampered slave,"

2742,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,"(The shrug is pure Hebraic) ... For what I've been,"
2743,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,A lenient Lord will tax me--and forgive.
2744,MONOLOG FROM A MATTRESS,_Dieu me pardonnera--c'est son metier._

3003,ROAST LEVIATHAN,
3004,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Roused from his unconcern,"
3005,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Behemot burns with anger.
3006,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Dripping sleep and languor from his heavy haunches,"
3007,ROAST LEVIATHAN,He turns from deep disdain and launches
3008,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Himself upon the thickening air,"
3009,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"And, with weird cries of sickening despair,"
3010,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Flies at Leviathan.
3011,ROAST LEVIATHAN,None can surmise the struggle that ensues--
3012,ROAST LEVIATHAN,The eyes lose sight of it and words refuse
3013,ROAST LEVIATHAN,To tell the story in its gory might.
3014,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Night passes after night,"
3015,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"And still the fight continues, still the sparks"
3016,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Fly from the iron sinews, ... till the marks"
3017,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Of fire and belching thunder fill the dark
3018,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"And, almost torn asunder, one falls stark,"
3019,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Hammering upon the other!...
3020,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"What clamor now is born, what crashings rise!"
3021,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Hot lightnings lash the skies and frightening cries
3022,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Clash with the hymns of saints and seraphim.
3023,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"The bloody limbs thrash through a ruddy dusk,"
3024,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Till one great tusk of Behemot has gored
3025,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Leviathan, restored to his full strength,"
3026,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Who, dealing fiercer blows in those last throes,"
3027,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Closes on reeling Behemot at length--
3028,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Piercing him with steel-pointed claws,"
3029,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Straight through the jaws to his disjointed head.
3030,ROAST LEVIATHAN,And both lie dead.
3031,ROAST LEVIATHAN,
3032,ROAST LEVIATHAN,_Then_ come the angels!
3033,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"With hoists and levers, joists and poles,"
3034,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"With knives and cleavers, ropes and saws,"
3035,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Down the long slopes to the gaping maws,"
3036,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"The angels hasten; hacking and carving,"
3037,ROAST LEVIATHAN,So nought will be lacking for the starving
3038,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Chosen of God, who in frozen wonderment"
3039,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Realize now what the terrible thunder meant.
3040,ROAST LEVIATHAN,How their mouths water while they are looking
3041,ROAST LEVIATHAN,At miles of slaughter and sniffing the cooking!
3042,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Whiffs of delectable fragrance swim by;
3043,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Spice-laden vagrants that float and entice,"
3044,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Tickling the throat and brimming the eye.
3045,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Ah! what rejoicing and crackling and roasting!
3046,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Ah! How the boys sing as, cackling and boasting,"
3047,ROAST LEVIATHAN,The angels' old wives and their nervous assistants
3048,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Run in to serve us....
3049,ROAST LEVIATHAN,
3050,ROAST LEVIATHAN,And while we are toasting
3051,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"The Fairest of All, they call from the distance"
3052,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"The rare ones of Time, they share our enjoyment;"
3053,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Their only employment to bear jars of wine
3054,ROAST LEVIATHAN,And shine like the stars in a circle of glory.
3055,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Here sways Rebekah accompanied by Zilpah;
3056,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Miriam plays to the singing of Bilhah;
3057,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Hagar has tales for us, Judith her story;"
3058,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Esther exhales bright romances and musk.
3059,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"There, in the dusky light, Salome dances."
3060,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Sara and Rachel and Leah and Ruth,"
3061,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Fairer than ever and all in their youth,"
3062,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Come at our call and go by our leave.
3063,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"And, from her bower of beauty, walks Eve"
3064,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"While, with the voice of a flower, she sings"
3065,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Of Eden, young earth and the birth of all things...."
3066,ROAST LEVIATHAN,
3067,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Peace without end.
3068,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Peace will descend on us, discord will cease;"
3069,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"And we, now so wretched, will lie stretched out"
3070,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Free of old doubt, on our cushions of ease."
3071,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"And, like a gold canopy over our bed,"
3072,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"The skin of Leviathan, tail-tip to head,"
3073,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Soon will be spread till it covers the skies.
3074,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Light will still rise from it; millions of bright
3075,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Facets of brilliance, shaming the white"
3076,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Glass of the moon, inflaming the night."
3077,ROAST LEVIATHAN,
3078,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"So Time shall pass and rest and pass again,"
3079,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"Burn with an endless zest and then return,"
3080,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Walk at our side and tide us to new joys;
3081,ROAST LEVIATHAN,"God's voice to guide us, beauty as our staff."
3082,ROAST LEVIATHAN,Thus shall Life be when Death has disappeared....

3951,II,"And the purple dusk, grown old, grown old in heart."
3952,II,Shadows of clouds flow inward from the sea.
3953,II,The mottled fields grow dark. The golden wall
3954,II,"Grows gray again, turns stone again, the tower,"
3955,II,"No longer kindled, darkens against a cloud."
3956,II,"Old is the world, old as the world am I;"
3957,II,"The cries of sheep rise upward from the fields,"

3970,II,I hear a woman's voice make answer then:
3971,II,"""Well, they are green, although no ship can sail them...."
3972,II,"Sky-larks rest in the grass, and start up singing"
3973,II,Before the girl who stoops to pick sea-poppies.

3975,II,"And the brown clay is runneled by the rain...."""
3976,II,"A moment since, the sheep that crop the grass"
3977,II,"Had long blue shadows, and the grass-tips sparkled:"
3978,II,"Now all grows old.... O voices strangely speaking,"
3979,II,"Voices of man and woman, voices of bells,"
3980,II,Diversely making comment on our time
3981,II,"Which flows and bears us with it into dusk,"
3982,II,Repeat the things you say! Repeat them slowly
3983,II,"Upon this air, make them an incantation"

4139,VII,Crimsons the sluggishly creeping foams of waves;
4140,VII,"The seaman, poised in the bow, rises and falls"
4141,VII,As the deep forefoot finds a way through waves;
4142,VII,"And there below him, steadily gazing westward,"
4143,VII,"Facing the wind, the sunset, the long cloud,"
4144,VII,"The goddess of the ship, proud figurehead,"
4145,VII,"Smiles inscrutably, plunges to crying waters,"

4154,VII,"Beyond the molten and ruined west, beyond"
4155,VII,"The light-rimmed sea, the sky itself? What secret"
4156,VII,Gives wisdom to her purpose? Now the cloud
4157,VII,In final conflagration pales and crumbles
4158,VII,Into the darkening waters. Now the stars
4159,VII,Burn softly through the dusk. The seaman strikes
4160,VII,"His small lost bell again, watching the west"
4161,VII,As she below him watches.... O pale goddess
4162,VII,"Whom not the darkness, even, or rain or storm,"
4163,VII,"Changes; whose great wings are bright with foam,"
4164,VII,"Whose breasts are cold as the sea, whose eyes forever"
4165,VII,Inscrutably take that light whereon they look--
4166,VII,"Speak to us! Make us certain, as you are,"
4167,VII,"That somewhere, beyond wave and wave and wave,"
4168,VII,That dreamed-of harbor lies which we would find.

4331,I,
4332,II,II
4333,II,
4334,II,"What's this of death, from you who never will die?"
4335,II,"Think you the wrist that fashioned you in clay,"
4336,II,The thumb that set the hollow just that way
4337,II,In your full throat and lidded the long eye
4338,II,"So roundly from the forehead, will let lie"
4339,II,"Broken, forgotten, under foot some day"
4340,II,"Your unimpeachable body, and so slay"
4341,II,The work he most had been remembered by?
4342,II,
4343,II,I tell you this: whatever of dust to dust
4344,II,"Goes down, whatever of ashes may return"
4345,II,"To its essential self in its own season,"
4346,II,"Loveliness such as yours will not be lost,"
4347,II,"But, cast in bronze upon his very urn,"
4348,II,"Make known him Master, and for what good reason."
4349,II,
4350,II,
4351,III,III
4352,III,
4353,III,"I know I am but summer to your heart,"
4354,III,And not the full four seasons of the year;
4355,III,And you must welcome from another part
4356,III,"Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear."
4357,III,No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell
4358,III,"Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;"
4359,III,And I have loved you all too long and well
4360,III,To carry still the high sweet breast of spring.
4361,III,
4362,III,"Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,"
4363,III,"I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,"
4364,III,That you may hail anew the bird and rose
4365,III,"When I come back to you, as summer comes."
4366,III,"Else will you seek, at some not distant time,"
4367,III,Even your summer in another clime.
4368,III,
4369,III,
4370,IV,IV
4371,IV,
4372,IV,"Here is a wound that never will heal, I know,"
4373,IV,Being wrought not of a dearness and a death
4374,IV,But of a love turned ashes and the breath
4375,IV,Gone out of beauty; never again will grow
4376,IV,"The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow"
4377,IV,Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath
4378,IV,"Its friendly weathers down, far underneath"
4379,IV,Shall be such bitterness of an old woe.
4380,IV,
4381,IV,"That April should be shattered by a gust,"
4382,IV,"That August should be leveled by a rain,"
4383,IV,"I can endure, and that the lifted dust"
4384,IV,Of man should settle to the earth again;
4385,IV,"But that a dream can die, will be a thrust"
4386,IV,Between my ribs forever of hot pain.
4387,IV,
4388,IV,
4389,V,V
4390,V,
4391,V,"What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,"
4392,V,"I have forgotten, and what arms have lain"
4393,V,Under my head till morning; but the rain
4394,V,"Is full of ghosts to-night, that tap and sigh"
4395,V,Upon the glass and listen for reply;
4396,V,"And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain,"
4397,V,For unremembered lads that not again
4398,V,Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.
4399,V,
4400,V,"Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,"
4401,V,"Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,"
4402,V,Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:
4403,V,I cannot say what loves have come and gone;
4404,V,I only know that summer sang in me
4405,V,"A little while, that in me sings no more."
4406,V,
4407,V,
4408,VI,VI
4409,VI,
4410,VI,Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
4411,VI,"Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,"
4412,VI,And lay them prone upon the earth and cease
4413,VI,"To ponder on themselves, the while they stare"
4414,VI,"At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere"
4415,VI,In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
4416,VI,"Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release"
4417,VI,From dusty bondage into luminous air.
4418,VI,
4419,VI,"O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,"
4420,VI,When first the shaft into his vision shone
4421,VI,Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
4422,VI,Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they
4423,VI,"Who, though once only and then but far away,"
4424,VI,Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.
4425,VI,
4426,VI,
4427,VII,VII
4428,VII,
4429,VII,"Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word!"
4430,VII,Give back my book and take my kiss instead.
4431,VII,Was it my enemy or my friend I heard?--
4432,VII,"""What a big book for such a little head!"""
4433,VII,"Come, I will show you now my newest hat,"
4434,VII,And you may watch me purse my mouth and prink.
4435,VII,"Oh, I shall love you still and all of that."
4436,VII,I never again shall tell you what I think.
4437,VII,
4438,VII,"I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly;"
4439,VII,You will not catch me reading any more;
4440,VII,I shall be called a wife to pattern by;
4441,VII,"And some day when you knock and push the door,"
4442,VII,"Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy,"
4443,VII,"I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me."
4444,VII,
4445,VII,
4446,VIII,VIII
4447,VIII,
4448,VIII,"Say what you will, and scratch my heart to find"
4449,VIII,The roots of last year's roses in my breast;
4450,VIII,I am as surely riper in my mind
4451,VIII,As if the fruit stood in the stalls confessed.
4452,VIII,"Laugh at the unshed leaf, say what you will,"
4453,VIII,"Call me in all things what I was before,"
4454,VIII,"A flutterer in the wind, a woman still;"
4455,VIII,I tell you I am what I was and more.
4456,VIII,
4457,VIII,"My branches weigh me down, frost cleans the air,"
4458,VIII,My sky is black with small birds bearing south;
4459,VIII,"Say what you will, confuse me with fine care,"
4460,VIII,"Put by my word as but an April truth,--"
4461,VIII,Autumn is no less on me that a rose
4462,VIII,Hugs the brown bough and sighs before it goes.
