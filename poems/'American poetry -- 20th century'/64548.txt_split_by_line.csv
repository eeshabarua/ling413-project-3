185,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,All the land is lying listless and a warm September breeze
186,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Has brushed the green to silver on the rustling orchard trees,"
187,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"And the near-by hills are curtained with a doleful, yellow cloak,"
188,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,For the world is swathed and sweltering and blanketed in smoke.
189,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Up the Sacramento Valley from the ’Frisco country south,"
190,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"To Seattle and Vancouver there’s a thirsty, baking drouth;"
191,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,From the Rockies to the Coast Range ’neath the heavy-hanging haze
192,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Leagues and leagues of trees are giving up their ghosts in smoke
193,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,and blaze;
194,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"There are endless acres smouldering, their trunks forever dead—"
195,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Oh, is it any wonder that the sun’s a red-hot red!"
196,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,
197,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"From the towns they’re rushing fighters—rushing, rushing them"
198,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,by rail.
199,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,They’re meeting them in motors and they’ll tote ’em up the trail
200,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Where the pack-nags are a-packing with a tramp, tramp, tramp—"
201,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Packing tools and grub and blankets up the canyon to the camp.
202,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,And fire they’ll foil with back-fire—pitting pitch ’gainst
203,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"snarling pitch,"
204,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,They’ll slash the brake and lacerate the earth with upturned ditch;
205,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Their skins will smart with singeing draughts that play along their
206,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"tracks,"
207,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"They’ll sting with wet from reeking sweat of shovel, pick and ax."
208,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,
209,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"She’s headed up for Clear Creek and she’ll make it ’fore she stops,"
210,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"For she’s a roaring crown-fire with her windswept, blazing tops."
211,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"From flaming lance to flaming lance on through the parching day,"
212,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Exhaling clouds of rolling black, she surges on her way."
213,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"She sucks the flying embers like a burning hurricane,"
214,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"She flings them miles around her in a sputtering, sparking rain,"
215,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"She pants and thirsts for living green, she stays not for the snags,"
216,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,She’s changed the steep embankments and she’s gained the higher
217,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,crags;
218,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Her Devil’s dance leads ever up—exultingly she swings
219,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Her wild red arms out toward the heights—she sizzles and she sings;
220,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"With dragon-spit she hisses, a maniac in her wrath,"
221,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,She laughs to scorn the human things that try to block her path.
222,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"On yonder crest they’ve made their stand—hark to the timber fall,"
223,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Again the winds have veered around—the bosses curse and call
224,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Through driving blasts of pitch-pine heat and pitch-pine smoke and
225,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"smell,"
226,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,“She’s turned again—hang to your tools—and damn you—run like
227,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Hell!”
228,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"It takes a canny general whose eye’s a weather-vane,"
229,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"A mighty canny general with seamed and schemy brain,"
230,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,To meet the gay manœuvers and the unconventional ways
231,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,That a breeze kicks up at noonday in a crown-fire forest blaze.

239,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,
240,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"But when the cooling later hours have lulled her hot desire,"
241,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,She straggles down the blackened trunks in fretful gusts of fire.
242,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"The tinder-brush has caught the spark, the temples of the night,"
243,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Their purple columns towering high, glow in the amber light."
244,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"There’s a maple dancing, dancing with her arabesques of gold,"
245,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Till her flaming scarfs have shrivelled, fluttered down and touched"
246,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,the mould.
247,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"From censers gleaming fitfully the dripping pitch-gum falls,"
248,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,And heavy incense fills those wild and weirdly lighted halls.
249,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Each hollow stump a cauldron is with molten pitch aglow—
250,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Its roots are twisted holes of pitch that pierce the earth below.
251,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Beyond the burning border of the bracken and the vine,"
252,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"A ruddy edge is eating through the carpet of the pine,"
253,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"But the fighters, they will meet it with their paths of upturned"
254,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,soil—
255,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,It’s many days those little paths have saved in sweat and toil.
256,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,A four-league stretch is burning now—the cavalcade of death
257,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Moves on with scarlet torch and blade and with a scarlet breath,"
258,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"And over all the smoking ridge, the clouds that hang like lead—"
259,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Oh, is it any wonder that the moon’s a red-hot red!"
260,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,
261,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,And when the golden ladders of tomorrow’s sickly sun
262,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"Slant through the mournful tree-tops and the holocaust is done,"
263,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,There won’t be much to interest the breathing things around
264,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,In the charred and ashen litter of the scarred and ghastly ground.
265,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,There’s quite a large community that undertook to change
266,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Its residential section to a more inviting range.
267,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"There is a fox—a red, red fox, who took his bouncing luck"
268,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,And dusted down the pathway of a panic-stricken buck;
269,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,There’s a corps of gray-backed diggers and a bunch of cottontails
270,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Who didn’t tarry very long to figure out their trails;
271,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"And the suckers and the peckers and the flickers and the wrens,"
272,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,"And the buzzards and the finches and the cocks and pheasant-hens,"
273,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,And the jays and bees and skeeters and the gnats and dragon-flies
274,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,Have saved their skins and feathers for they’re fairly weather-wise.
275,BY SCARLET TORCH AND BLADE,But woe betide the crawling things and heaven help the mark

308,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Leaving your trails where trails were not;
309,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Weavers—weaving gigantically
310,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Into a boundless tapestry,"
311,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Systems of travel skillfully traced,"

325,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
326,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Long have you wrestled, unconfounded"
327,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,With problems the grim old earth propounded;
328,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Meeting each taunting challenge while
329,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"She watched with cold, sardonic smile,"
330,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Flinching at nothing your labor met,"
331,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Writing your answer in dirt and sweat.

342,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Deafening thud and crunch and gash,"
343,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Tearing their rifts where boughs arch high,"

365,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Against the push of sliding shale;
366,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Peeling a slope to fill a draw;
367,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Stuffing the crusher’s hungry maw
368,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,That crumbles to bits the rock you’ve fed
369,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,To blanket a roadway’s winding bed;
370,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,These are the digits running through
371,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,The problems that Nature’s handed you.
372,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
373,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,And we of the people—we for whom
374,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"These miracles are, behold we come!"

399,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,A welcome speaks:

401,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Tryst in our mountains! Play and sleep,"
402,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Wrapped in the silence here that lies

404,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Wake if you will and see the sun
405,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Unveiling our canyons one by one,"
406,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Slanting his golden fingers till
407,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"The shadows have crept from each drowsy hill,"

422,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
423,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Come oh you people! Look upon
424,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"The bountiful sweep of the Oregon,"
425,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Forcing a pass through the blue Cascades,"
426,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Lapping the walls of her palisades,"
427,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Cradled in sand-dunes gleaming white,"
428,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Girdling her islands of malachite!
429,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,And high on the hills where a thrush’s song
430,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Tells out its gladness, there winds along"
431,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Like a sinuous serpent—twist and bend,"
432,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Following on to the river’s trend,"
433,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,The lordliest highway that ever ran
434,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Through the hills of the world since the dawn of man.
435,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Pride of the West! Sublime event!
436,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Columbia the Magnificent!
437,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Conceived by a poet who believed[1]
438,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Dreams should be dreamed and then achieved.
439,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
440,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"And he bored him a tunnel—rock and boulder,"
441,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Out of a mountain’s granite shoulder,"
442,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Chiseled his windows—arching wide,"
443,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Glimpsing the sky and the rolling tide;
444,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Throwing his graceful spans across
445,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Dripping ravines of fern and moss;
446,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Charming the serpent up and down
447,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Till it lazily coiled on the lofty crown,"
448,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Goal of each traveller who would be
449,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Thrilled with unspeakable ecstacy.
450,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
451,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Oh climb in your chariots pink and green,"
452,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Rattletrap Lizzie and limousine,"
453,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Throbbing triumphantly toward the sky,"
454,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,(There’s never a grade but you take on high)
455,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Honking and honking, round on round,"
456,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Honking again till the cliffs resound,"
457,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Looping at last the Crown Point top—
458,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,And there you stop!
459,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Where winds from the North, East, West and South"
460,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Tumble their clouds in the chasm’s mouth—
461,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Curtains of mist and far-off thunder—
462,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,And somehow you look and look and wonder
463,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,If he who was wise to the sparrow’s fall
464,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Didn’t have something to do with it all.
465,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
466,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Over the broad Willamette go
467,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Into the Coast Range—learn to know
468,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Who are the Vikings—see them rise
469,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Out of the gulches into the skies;
470,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,There are plummet-lines dropped through the hearts of these
471,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,And they’re girthed like the pillars of Hercules!
472,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Nursed by the centuries, still they stand,"
473,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,The Viking Spruce of the bottom-land.
474,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
475,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"And ever the pageant swings along,"
476,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Blossoms and fruit and birds and song—
477,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Sword-ferns high-heaped beneath the firs,"
478,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Glistening like emerald scimiters;
479,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Foxglove and fireweed—sunlight flashes
480,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Blotching the banks in purple splashes;
481,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Salmon berries in hordes untold—
482,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Luscious clusters of dangling gold;
483,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Elders above them, bending branches."
484,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Falling in ruby-red avalanches,"
485,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Hedging the roadways, climbing back—"

489,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Ranges, ruff-backed with their jagged trees,"
490,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Crawling and sprawling down into the seas,"

494,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Tossing their manes—and the cormorants
495,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Strut with the lions and blustering seals,"
496,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,And the sun-god reels
497,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,With a splash of blood
498,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"Into the great, Pacific flood!"
499,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,
500,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,"And this is the welcome waiting you,"
501,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,Drivers of chariots gold and blue—
502,BUILDERS OF HIGHWAYS,You who fare

511,OREGON SNOW,
512,OREGON SNOW,I’m glad I’m not in town today
513,OREGON SNOW,For townfolk always have a way
514,OREGON SNOW,Of hating snow—they stamp it off
515,OREGON SNOW,Their feet and shake their clothes and cough
516,OREGON SNOW,And fume and curse it every time
517,OREGON SNOW,It comes. It seems a crime
518,OREGON SNOW,To say you love it when it snows—
519,OREGON SNOW,Down in the town. Yet I suppose
520,OREGON SNOW,They’re not to blame—it always brings
521,OREGON SNOW,A peck of ills and heartache things
522,OREGON SNOW,Down in the town. There’s such
523,OREGON SNOW,A lot of misery—so much
524,OREGON SNOW,That sleeps along until the touch
525,OREGON SNOW,Of snow and cold wakes it again
526,OREGON SNOW,To sudden pain.
527,OREGON SNOW,You really can’t blame folks a bit
528,OREGON SNOW,For hating snow and cursing it
529,OREGON SNOW,The way they do
530,OREGON SNOW,Down in the town—it’s natural to.

535,OREGON SNOW,Shot through with light

537,OREGON SNOW,
538,OREGON SNOW,"But here—up here, it’s driving white"
539,OREGON SNOW,Across the gray tree-trunks; all night
540,OREGON SNOW,It fell and laid one blanket more
541,OREGON SNOW,Upon the store
542,OREGON SNOW,We had.
543,OREGON SNOW,"And I am glad,"
544,OREGON SNOW,"For here—up here, it’s not a crime"
545,OREGON SNOW,To love the snow in winter-time.
546,OREGON SNOW,
547,OREGON SNOW,It’s hip-deep in the clover-field
548,OREGON SNOW,Behind the barn—the woods there shield
549,OREGON SNOW,The sun. I took a jog
550,OREGON SNOW,On show-shoes with the dog
551,OREGON SNOW,Across the ditch that marks the clover’s edge
552,OREGON SNOW,Into a straggling hedge
553,OREGON SNOW,Of saplings—only yesterday they were
554,OREGON SNOW,So cocky and so straight—each baby-fir
555,OREGON SNOW,A prickly little grenadier; and now—
556,OREGON SNOW,How vanquished! Every bough
557,OREGON SNOW,"Limp, beaten, crushed, as if"
558,OREGON SNOW,The snow had said—“Oh stiff
559,OREGON SNOW,And upright little tree
560,OREGON SNOW,How much of me
561,OREGON SNOW,Do you suppose your arms will hold?”
562,OREGON SNOW,To which the tree made answer bold—
563,OREGON SNOW,“I am a young and husky fir—
564,OREGON SNOW,"All you can give, I’ll hold, Good Sir!”"
565,OREGON SNOW,A rather glib and short
566,OREGON SNOW,"Retort,"
567,OREGON SNOW,"At which the snow was somewhat stirred,"
568,OREGON SNOW,He took the sapling at his word!
569,OREGON SNOW,"For so it looked, the way the snow"
570,OREGON SNOW,"Had laid them low,"
571,OREGON SNOW,"Swamped to their ears,"
572,OREGON SNOW,Those prickly little grenadiers.
573,OREGON SNOW,
574,OREGON SNOW,That’s what it is to be so small
575,OREGON SNOW,"And near the ground, but when you’re grand and tall"
576,OREGON SNOW,You shake your boughs and let it fall
577,OREGON SNOW,"In great cascades of blinding white,"
578,OREGON SNOW,Shot through with light
579,OREGON SNOW,Or morning suns—spray after spray.
580,OREGON SNOW,The gray boles sway
581,OREGON SNOW,With every windy gust that breaks
582,OREGON SNOW,To dust and flakes
583,OREGON SNOW,"The tumbling clumps,"
584,OREGON SNOW,Baptizing brush and stumps
585,OREGON SNOW,"And huge-heaped logs—a deluge, white"
586,OREGON SNOW,And dazzling bright.
587,OREGON SNOW,
588,OREGON SNOW,"And still it snows,"
589,OREGON SNOW,And blows
590,OREGON SNOW,Across the orchards in big drifts;
591,OREGON SNOW,But for the sunbursts through the rifts
592,OREGON SNOW,"Of cloud today,"
593,OREGON SNOW,It’s never quit. And when it goes away—
594,OREGON SNOW,"This snow up here, it will be free from blame"
595,OREGON SNOW,For it will leave in beauty as it came.
596,OREGON SNOW,The sun will loosen all the bonds
597,OREGON SNOW,That bind the baby-sapling’s fronds
598,OREGON SNOW,"Close to the ground,"
599,OREGON SNOW,And they’ll rebound.
600,OREGON SNOW,The ice-locked creek will show its green
601,OREGON SNOW,And swirling eddies in between
602,OREGON SNOW,The marble bridges flung across
603,OREGON SNOW,Its twisted banks of moss.
604,OREGON SNOW,
605,OREGON SNOW,Each day will see new colors peep;
606,OREGON SNOW,Gray bark and green—the deep
607,OREGON SNOW,"Rich sheen of laurels—short, stalky grapes,"
608,OREGON SNOW,"Stiff, jagged, red—and twisted shapes"
609,OREGON SNOW,"Of leaves turned russet, shrivelled, sere—"
610,OREGON SNOW,Still dangling from the stems of the dead year—
611,OREGON SNOW,"All penciled bold against the bright,"
612,OREGON SNOW,"Cold snow, like patterns on a page of spotless white."
613,OREGON SNOW,"And each new day will leave some strange,"
614,OREGON SNOW,"Blue arabesque upon the eastern range,"
615,OREGON SNOW,"Drag streaks of ochre down the fields, and shade"
616,OREGON SNOW,The purple brush-lands deeper where they fade
617,OREGON SNOW,"Off to the west, and pools of melting snow will hold"
618,OREGON SNOW,The winter evening sun’s last splash of gold.
619,OREGON SNOW,
620,OREGON SNOW,These are the things God keeps in store
621,OREGON SNOW,"For us up here, when in a few days more,"
622,OREGON SNOW,"This snow—that’s driving hard today,"
623,OREGON SNOW,Will melt away.

627,THE PRUNER,
628,THE PRUNER,Listen! That bump against the steps—he’s back.
629,THE PRUNER,"The dog comes floundering on his track,"
630,THE PRUNER,"His shaggy clumps are lumped with ice, he shakes"
631,THE PRUNER,Vociferously his drippy coat and makes
632,THE PRUNER,"Straight for the kitchen—he’s a dog, the kind"
633,THE PRUNER,Who takes no longer than he should to find
634,THE PRUNER,What’s in his pan—or isn’t. It’s cold mush
635,THE PRUNER,This time. The man has just kicked off the slush
636,THE PRUNER,And shuffled up the steps. They’re awkward things—
637,THE PRUNER,"Those bear-paws, when the rawhide’s caked; he flings"
638,THE PRUNER,His soggy mittens off and takes his hat
639,THE PRUNER,And swishes it across the frozen mat.
640,THE PRUNER,
641,THE PRUNER,He clatters on the porch—then stoops to loose
642,THE PRUNER,"The knots that hold his boots fast in the noose,"
643,THE PRUNER,Kicks free his weary feet and stands his hook
644,THE PRUNER,Against the logs. He has an all-in look
645,THE PRUNER,Tonight—that crook that’s got his shoulder-blade
646,THE PRUNER,Is pruner’s luck—a man’s arm isn’t made
647,THE PRUNER,To reach and twist all day without some bit
648,THE PRUNER,Of ache to take home with him when he’s quit.
649,THE PRUNER,That wind-tan and the stubble-growth of beard
650,THE PRUNER,That’s cropped out on his chin and gotten smeared
651,THE PRUNER,"Around his throat, they do a useful turn—"
652,THE PRUNER,They temper cold and dull the bright snow-burn.
653,THE PRUNER,
654,THE PRUNER,It snowed this morning when he went away
655,THE PRUNER,With those big bear-paws on—it snowed all day;
656,THE PRUNER,And though his sleeves and neck are soaked a lot
657,THE PRUNER,"With all the constant reaching up, it’s not"
658,THE PRUNER,So bad—the snow—for when it’s four feet deep
659,THE PRUNER,"Or so, a pruner doesn’t have to keep"
660,THE PRUNER,"That raking stretch. Another day and night,"
661,THE PRUNER,"If it keeps up like this, will fix it right."
662,THE PRUNER,"All yesterday it rained—he didn’t stop,"
663,THE PRUNER,Just went ahead and pruned—and let it drop.
664,THE PRUNER,The day before was sun—a blinding glare
665,THE PRUNER,On snow—it’s amber goggles then and they’re
666,THE PRUNER,Forever getting fogged. Of course a day
667,THE PRUNER,Gets sort of tucked in now and then that may
668,THE PRUNER,"Not be so bad, although they’re pretty few,"
669,THE PRUNER,But good or bad there’s little else to do
670,THE PRUNER,"In winter-time, but prune. And it is plain,"
671,THE PRUNER,A man who loves his trees won’t stop for rain
672,THE PRUNER,Or cold or driving snow or dazzling sun
673,THE PRUNER,Until the job he started on is done.
674,THE PRUNER,
675,THE PRUNER,To any man like that a tree is bound
676,THE PRUNER,"To mean more than a root shoved in the ground,"
677,THE PRUNER,"For they are his, his own, his pets—just like"
678,THE PRUNER,His kids. They’re part of him and so they strike
679,THE PRUNER,"Into his heart. He’s cuddled them, he’s stuck"
680,THE PRUNER,With them through all the ups and downs of luck;
681,THE PRUNER,Instead of chicken-pox he’s had to fight
682,THE PRUNER,"Anthracnos, winter-kill and scab and blight;"
683,THE PRUNER,"He knows his rows—what every tree’s been through,"
684,THE PRUNER,The one’s who’ve done him proud and strugglers too.
685,THE PRUNER,"And he remembers how, four years ago—"
686,THE PRUNER,"That day the big freeze came with all the snow,"
687,THE PRUNER,He found the weighted limbs of some of them
688,THE PRUNER,All split and broken from the mother stem.
689,THE PRUNER,
690,THE PRUNER,That’s why there’s something human enters in
691,THE PRUNER,To pruning trees—it almost seems a sin
692,THE PRUNER,Sometimes to lop off here and lop off there
693,THE PRUNER,The wood you’ve coaxed with such a heap of care;
694,THE PRUNER,"Like punishment it seems, and though it’s wise,"
695,THE PRUNER,Those fruit-spurred boughs are hard to sacrifice.
696,THE PRUNER,And when he takes a tree and prunes the wood
697,THE PRUNER,"The way it should be done for that tree’s good,"
698,THE PRUNER,He does not see the severed sticks that show
699,THE PRUNER,Black-twisted there upon the trampled snow—
700,THE PRUNER,"To him, each one’s a green-leafed bough that’s gone,"
701,THE PRUNER,With all its scented crimson apples on.
702,THE PRUNER,
703,THE PRUNER,His blouse is steaming now—hung on a chair
704,THE PRUNER,Before the kitchen-stove—she put it there.
705,THE PRUNER,"She’s humming cheerful-like, tonight it’s toast"
706,THE PRUNER,And coffee and potatoes and pot-roast;
707,THE PRUNER,"He will forget his shoulder after while,"
708,THE PRUNER,And when he’s filled and dry—he’ll smile.

711,SNOOTS,SNOOTS
712,SNOOTS,
713,SNOOTS,Say—have you ever given thought
714,SNOOTS,To snoots—just snoots? Most likely not!
715,SNOOTS,There’s so much else to think about
716,SNOOTS,That snoots get crowded out.
717,SNOOTS,An uncouth thing
718,SNOOTS,And yet most interesting
719,SNOOTS,"Somehow, and so of snoots I sing"
720,SNOOTS,"And of that strange, instinctive sense—"
721,SNOOTS,Mute marvel of God’s providence!
722,SNOOTS,
723,SNOOTS,Now take a snoot that’s prowled around
724,SNOOTS,Like old Pete’s there—along the ground
725,SNOOTS,And through the brush from log to log—
726,SNOOTS,The plain snoot of a common dog.
727,SNOOTS,"How often, knocking through the wood,"
728,SNOOTS,Deep in the maples I have stood
729,SNOOTS,Stock still—and watched that canny brute.
730,SNOOTS,"Tense to the trail, by rock and root,"
731,SNOOTS,"Zigzagging now, then onward straight!"
732,SNOOTS,Not once there would he hesitate.
733,SNOOTS,"Eyes to the earth, alert and quick,"
734,SNOOTS,"By briar, branch and broken stick,"
735,SNOOTS,"Till pausing short, with one glad bound"
736,SNOOTS,"And switching tail—his quarry found,"
737,SNOOTS,He sprang to meet
738,SNOOTS,"His master, crouching at his feet,"
739,SNOOTS,At last content.
740,SNOOTS,And this strange thing—you call it _scent_
741,SNOOTS,
742,SNOOTS,"The leaves are trodden by a boot,"
743,SNOOTS,"A little later comes a snoot,"
744,SNOOTS,"And quick as thought it sniffs the air,"
745,SNOOTS,"The soil, and sifts the odors there."
746,SNOOTS,"A hundred kinds of smells we’ll say,"
747,SNOOTS,"The mould, the moss, the worms, the clay"
748,SNOOTS,"The drying leaves, the twigs and stones,"
749,SNOOTS,"The fallen needles and the cones,"
750,SNOOTS,"The little flowers, the growing plants."
751,SNOOTS,"The bugs, the chipmunks and the ants;"
752,SNOOTS,And yet that sniffing snoot could tell
753,SNOOTS,"Among all these, the one faint smell"
754,SNOOTS,That lingered vaguely in the wake
755,SNOOTS,That two swift-striding boots might make.
756,SNOOTS,
757,SNOOTS,"You marvel at his skill when he,"
758,SNOOTS,"The master of a symphony,"
759,SNOOTS,Detects one jarring note that comes
760,SNOOTS,"Up through the beat of many drums,"
761,SNOOTS,"And tambourines and banging things,"
762,SNOOTS,And blaring brass and whining strings;
763,SNOOTS,You cite some instance of the kind
764,SNOOTS,To eulogize the human mind—
765,SNOOTS,To show attainment absolute!
766,SNOOTS,I point you to my Peter’s snoot—
767,SNOOTS,Upon my lap he comes to lay
768,SNOOTS,"Its cold, damp tip, still smeared with clay."
769,SNOOTS,
770,SNOOTS,"Oh, all you hordes of furry brutes,"
771,SNOOTS,"Be glad you’re blessed with telltale snoots,"
772,SNOOTS,So nicely tuned that with a sniff
773,SNOOTS,"Of earth or air, you catch the whiff"
774,SNOOTS,"Of danger there. You mountain sheep,"
775,SNOOTS,Superb upon your rocky steep;
776,SNOOTS,"You splendid elk, far domiciled"
777,SNOOTS,"In mountain fastness, coursing wild;"
778,SNOOTS,"You bonny deer and monster moose,"
779,SNOOTS,"Brandless, unfenced, will-free and loose;"
780,SNOOTS,You wolves couched in your rock-ribbed lairs;
781,SNOOTS,"You blubber-padded, big-pawed bears;"
782,SNOOTS,"You foxes tunneled deep in roots,"
783,SNOOTS,Wise was the God Who gave you snoots!

793,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"When he started in to milk,"
794,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"Tongue a-smack and bulging tum,"
795,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Filled at last—his vacuum.
796,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Soft blue hoofs and knobby pegs
797,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Soon were prancing just like legs;
798,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Got him weaned till bran he took
799,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"Like a codfish bolts a hook,"
800,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"Till he danced in sheer delight,"
801,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Till he waxed in youthful might.
802,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Dawn of day and forth he went
803,LITTLE BLACK BULL,For adventure—jubilant;
804,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"Innocent and wondering eyes,"
805,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"All the world a glad surprise,"
806,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Then they drove him down the hill

808,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"Wondering as the world went by,"
809,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"Green of trees and blue of sky,"
810,LITTLE BLACK BULL,"What adventure—joyous, new,"
811,LITTLE BLACK BULL,Little bull was going to.

821,MOUNTAIN TOPS,"When you have known the grunts and chills,"
822,MOUNTAIN TOPS,"The cold, the sweat, the gasps, the thrills;"
823,MOUNTAIN TOPS,And winced at dazzling snow reared high
824,MOUNTAIN TOPS,Against a dye of cobalt sky;
825,MOUNTAIN TOPS,And faced the blast that strives its best
826,MOUNTAIN TOPS,To hurl you headlong off the crest;
827,MOUNTAIN TOPS,Seen countless ranges fade into
828,MOUNTAIN TOPS,The whole vast earth-encircling blue
829,MOUNTAIN TOPS,That holds the rim of the sky’s bowl;
830,MOUNTAIN TOPS,And sniffed the clouds and watched them roll
831,MOUNTAIN TOPS,Close-packed beneath you in the sun and ride
832,MOUNTAIN TOPS,Like foaming billows at flood-tide;
833,MOUNTAIN TOPS,"When you have done these things, you’ll speak"
834,MOUNTAIN TOPS,With reverence of a mountain-peak.

842,THE RIVER,Once I gurgled with a hiss
843,THE RIVER,In the glacier’s cold abyss.
844,THE RIVER,Dull and muffled was my song
845,THE RIVER,As I felt my way along
846,THE RIVER,Through the mystic caves of glass
847,THE RIVER,Far below the great crevasse.
848,THE RIVER,"Now I greet the blessed light,"
849,THE RIVER,Out of night and bursting white—
850,THE RIVER,"Baby-giant—keen to forge,"
851,THE RIVER,"Loudly laughing, through the gorge;"
852,THE RIVER,"Straddling rocks and riding bumps,"
853,THE RIVER,"Brushing branches, hurdling stumps,"
854,THE RIVER,"Peevish, boiling, sluggish, slack,"
855,THE RIVER,"Lunging forward, swirling back;"
856,THE RIVER,"Leaping from a bouldered dale,"
857,THE RIVER,"Snaking through a clay-banked swale,"
858,THE RIVER,Draining streams from every draw
859,THE RIVER,"Down into my hungry maw,"
860,THE RIVER,Swelling with the tribute paid—
861,THE RIVER,This is how a river’s made.

868,THE JUGGLER,The Juggler—confident and proud
869,THE JUGGLER,"Above the gaping, breathless crowd!"
870,THE JUGGLER,"So in the gathering storm, he swayed—"
871,THE JUGGLER,The Forest Juggler—unafraid!
872,THE JUGGLER,"Schooled by the blasts of centuries,"
873,THE JUGGLER,"Proudly he looked on lesser trees,"
874,THE JUGGLER,Rearing his mighty head on high
875,THE JUGGLER,Against the red-streaked western sky.
876,THE JUGGLER,"Then broke the gale—the clouds unlocked,"
877,THE JUGGLER,And such a wind as never rocked
878,THE JUGGLER,"His stalwart trunk, now made him dance."
879,THE JUGGLER,He swayed in ancient confidence
880,THE JUGGLER,Till once he reached—too far! Then all
881,THE JUGGLER,"His shaft went toppling to the fall,"
882,THE JUGGLER,With grinding boughs and crunch and thud.
883,THE JUGGLER,"Upripped those gorgon-roots, the mud—"
884,THE JUGGLER,"Wide-flung, left but a crater-hole"
885,THE JUGGLER,Where it had towered—that giant bole!
886,THE JUGGLER,"The wind has gone upon his way,"
887,THE JUGGLER,A patch of sky shows where he lay—
888,THE JUGGLER,Who juggled long and fearlessly
889,THE JUGGLER,Until a greater came than he.

926,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,"Red-squirrels jabb’ring while they eat,"
927,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Cones a-dropping at your feet;
928,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,"Pecker diving for a worm,"
929,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Ringing echoes with each squirm;
930,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Squawking jays and the palaver
931,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Of a pheasant breaking cover;
932,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,But the strangest sound to me
933,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,"Comes when winds blow fitfully,"
934,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,"In the darkness, like a moan—"
935,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,"Chilling to the marrow-bone,"
936,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Dying now upon the gale
937,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Like a far-off cougar’s wail.
938,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,"Now it rises—peevish, wild,"
939,MINSTRELS OF THE NIGHT,Like the fretting of a child;

949,THE LONG BET,
950,THE LONG BET,The mountain road will lead you past
951,THE LONG BET,"The shack. It’s easily told, the last"
952,THE LONG BET,Old tumbledown this side the ridge
953,THE LONG BET,Of snags; a little bridge
954,THE LONG BET,Is there that hasn’t yet dropped through.
955,THE LONG BET,"I don’t know how it is with you,"
956,THE LONG BET,But every time I see that shack
957,THE LONG BET,It gets me somehow—calls me back
958,THE LONG BET,And tries to speak. The caved-in shed
959,THE LONG BET,Where some poor nag was fed
960,THE LONG BET,"His mighty little, and the rakes"
961,THE LONG BET,"Upstanding still—and scattered shakes,"
962,THE LONG BET,Tell how they labored to deceive
963,THE LONG BET,The man with hope. In make-believe
964,THE LONG BET,They played a barn—and over there
965,THE LONG BET,The several-acre clearing where
966,THE LONG BET,A few anæmic blades of grain
967,THE LONG BET,Still volunteer; but oh
968,THE LONG BET,That Potter’s Field where grow
969,THE LONG BET,In broken rows of twos and threes
970,THE LONG BET,"The little, weazened apple-trees."
971,THE LONG BET,
972,THE LONG BET,"Mere stalks are some, that died"
973,THE LONG BET,"Beside the stakes where they were tied,"
974,THE LONG BET,While others held tenaciously
975,THE LONG BET,Their stunted semblance to a tree—
976,THE LONG BET,Their dangling leaves are sparse
977,THE LONG BET,And bloodless—so the farce
978,THE LONG BET,Goes on. I know he stood that day
979,THE LONG BET,He planted them and looked away
980,THE LONG BET,Across his claim—beyond that draw
981,THE LONG BET,"Where all the ghost-trees are, and saw"
982,THE LONG BET,Them fade away and in their stead
983,THE LONG BET,A smiling orchard with its red
984,THE LONG BET,Fruit-laden boughs. At any rate
985,THE LONG BET,He likely staked with fate
986,THE LONG BET,"What all he had—all he could get,"
987,THE LONG BET,And made his one long bet.
988,THE LONG BET,
989,THE LONG BET,He staked the woman too—
990,THE LONG BET,That calico of faded blue
991,THE LONG BET,"Still waving by the kitchen door,"
992,THE LONG BET,The shreds of curtains on the four
993,THE LONG BET,"Wee windows on the front, proclaim"
994,THE LONG BET,There was a woman in the game.
995,THE LONG BET,"Lord, how he must have strung"
996,THE LONG BET,Her on—to drag her up among
997,THE LONG BET,Those snags! And what it must have been
998,THE LONG BET,In winter! Think of living in
999,THE LONG BET,That tumbly hut—eight feet of snow
1000,THE LONG BET,Outside—and ten below.
1001,THE LONG BET,"Suppose the woman took her bed,"
1002,THE LONG BET,"Caved in, just like the shed"
1003,THE LONG BET,"Is now—upon her back laid flat,"
1004,THE LONG BET,(The work alone would tend to that).

1012,THE LONG BET,
1013,THE LONG BET,Of course they had a kid.
1014,THE LONG BET,"The broken go-cart shows they did,"
1015,THE LONG BET,It’s shy a wheel and tongue—
1016,THE LONG BET,You’ll find it there among
1017,THE LONG BET,The weeds just by the front door stoop.
1018,THE LONG BET,It’s ten to one he’d have the croup
1019,THE LONG BET,And scarcely likely he’d get off
1020,THE LONG BET,Without the whooping-cough.
1021,THE LONG BET,"Good God! It’s fiendish anywhere,"
1022,THE LONG BET,But think of whooping-cough up there
1023,THE LONG BET,In winter! All that gloom—
1024,THE LONG BET,A little room
1025,THE LONG BET,"With stuffy stove and candle-light,"
1026,THE LONG BET,"And whooping, whooping through the night."
1027,THE LONG BET,
1028,THE LONG BET,And when the man gave in
1029,THE LONG BET,"At last and found he couldn’t win,"
1030,THE LONG BET,Found apples couldn’t keep alive
1031,THE LONG BET,Or thrive
1032,THE LONG BET,Or come to any good
1033,THE LONG BET,One bit more than a human could
1034,THE LONG BET,"Up there, and when the day"
1035,THE LONG BET,Came that they went away—
1036,THE LONG BET,Packed up their leavings in a load
1037,THE LONG BET,"And joggled down the mountain road,"
1038,THE LONG BET,I’ll bet they both looked back
1039,THE LONG BET,And cursed that shack.
1040,THE LONG BET,And it is hard to think
1041,THE LONG BET,That even that rose-pink
1042,THE LONG BET,Of early sunrise on the top
1043,THE LONG BET,Of that old mountain had one drop
1044,THE LONG BET,Of beauty left for them. It might
1045,THE LONG BET,Be that the white
1046,THE LONG BET,Ghost-trees bespoke their mood
1047,THE LONG BET,Of helplessness and solitude
1048,THE LONG BET,"That day. It’s easily told,"
1049,THE LONG BET,The old
1050,THE LONG BET,Ramshackle place this side the ridge
1051,THE LONG BET,Of snags—the little bridge

1081,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Down through the rocks—a bloody track
1082,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Into the big, black crack;"
1083,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And that was back

1088,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,To see outsiders rave
1089,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"About the marvels of his cave,"
1090,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"As proud of every chamber, niche and shelf"

1094,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Around down there, and scrape and stoop"
1095,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"To see the things you see,"
1096,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The more you think he has a right to be.
1097,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Dick’s different too—he says his say
1098,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,As if he’d learned it yesterday
1099,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Instead of when he did.
1100,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,With all the ardor of a kid
1101,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,He rambles on—it’s always new
1102,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"To him, just as it is to you."
1103,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1104,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,He tells you how the place was formed
1105,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"In glacial days, when waters stormed"
1106,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And roared and cut their channels through
1107,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The very spot where you
1108,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Stand marveling. Then comes the change.
1109,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The glaciers pass, along the range"
1110,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"They ride no more, the streams are dried,"
1111,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The conflict stops. On every side
1112,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Lime-laden drops begin
1113,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,To percolate and filter in—
1114,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The long, cold sweat appears."
1115,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"For several hundred thousand years,"
1116,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Away from light, away from time,"
1117,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Those little drops have oozed their lime.
1118,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1119,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Relentless patience must have played
1120,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Its part when all this underworld was made,"
1121,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And infinite variety took hand
1122,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,When it was planned—
1123,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Or was it planned? Was it intent—
1124,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Or some sublimely perfect accident
1125,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,That caused to be
1126,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,That marble-fluted canopy
1127,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Above the many-pillowed throne
1128,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,That’s shown
1129,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"In brilliant, bold relief against our light"
1130,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,In this Lost Paradise of night.
1131,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And see—
1132,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Upflocking toward the canopy,"
1133,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"A-scurrying,"
1134,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Those baffling forms that cling
1135,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And swarms of pudgy shapes that ride
1136,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"In half-lights, side by side."
1137,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And was it chance that made
1138,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The Coral Garden’s gray arcade
1139,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And pillared it and set in place
1140,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Each tiny statuette and grotesque face;
1141,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And petrified the water-falls;
1142,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And hung the walls
1143,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And roofs of all the halls
1144,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"With rows of frescoes—pendant, bright,"
1145,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And gleaming like a starry night;
1146,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And made the sweetest chimes to ring—
1147,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,We heard their clear notes echoing.
1148,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"If it was chance, I didn’t find"
1149,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,It so. To me it seemed a master-mind
1150,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Was lurking there—some spirit born of endless night,"
1151,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Transfusing each slow-dropping mite
1152,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Into a wonder-thing
1153,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"By deft, fantastic fashioning."
1154,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1155,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Dick said
1156,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The place was uninhabited,"
1157,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Except for a few bats
1158,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,At times and some pack-rats
1159,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,That nested near the mouth—but how could he
1160,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Tell what _had_ been? To me
1161,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The place was just _deserted_—that was all!
1162,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Because we heard no laughter fall,"
1163,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Nor voices ring,"
1164,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Proved not a thing.
1165,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1166,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And when
1167,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The first intrusion came of mortal men,"
1168,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,There must have been a merry muss
1169,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And universal exodus
1170,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Down through those dark recesses there
1171,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And on to undiscovered regions where
1172,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,No man may hope to go.
1173,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,I would have witnessed such a show!
1174,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Those trooping little refugees
1175,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of divers personalities
1176,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"In babbling groups, by twos and threes,"
1177,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,With all their household goods—they must have moved
1178,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Them all—the fact is proved
1179,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Conclusively, as there’s no trace"
1180,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of such effects in any place.
1181,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1182,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Perhaps the Pix went first—
1183,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"They’re fearsome, so I’ve heard, and cursed"
1184,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"With nerves. And then the Nixie crew,"
1185,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The Pix’s shapely cousins who
1186,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Are beautiful—as Nixies go,"
1187,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And no less slow
1188,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,To move when trouble stirs the air.
1189,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Now comes a flare
1190,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of lurid light—the rhythmic tramps
1191,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of Gwelfs who bear their swinging lamps
1192,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of cocobol;
1193,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,A roll
1194,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of music like bassoons—
1195,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The beating wings of Dragleloons,"
1196,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Their patterned pinions show their sheen
1197,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And glow with iridescent green—
1198,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Out trails the light—a glint of scales
1199,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Gives hint of flashing, rainbow tails."
1200,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1201,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Now Master Goblin falls in line,"
1202,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The chills are jumping in his spine,"
1203,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"His eyeballs bulge with speechless fear,"
1204,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,His mouth’s a slit from ear to ear.
1205,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,He goes galumping in his boots;
1206,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Behind him thump the Dormizoots,"
1207,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And then the Elves.
1208,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"From all the crannies, nooks and shelves"
1209,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The Wiffles come, and scrambling Wools,"
1210,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And Blurbs and jibbering Gabools—
1211,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"They stumble, tumble—now they run,"
1212,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Each fumbles for the other one,"
1213,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Mate calls for mate—
1214,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,A seething flux conglomerate
1215,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Of cave-born entities.
1216,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"They pant and grunt and squeak and wheeze,"
1217,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"They stampede, yell,"
1218,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,And chase pell-mell.
1219,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Through tortuous tunnels walled with light
1220,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The pigmy pageant makes its flight,"
1221,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The last far turn is made,"
1222,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The swinging flicker-flashes fade,"
1223,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The clamor and the cries
1224,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Are dimmed—the babbling tumult dies.
1225,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1226,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The palace rooms are dark, the halls of state,"
1227,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The Coral Gardens—all are desolate.
1228,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,No music falls—
1229,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The conclaves and the carnivals,"
1230,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The mystic rites,"
1231,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"The colors bathed in mellow lights,"
1232,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,The throbbing life and mirth
1233,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Of all this chambered, nether-earth"
1234,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Are gone. Nor will one Elf return
1235,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,To ring the crystal chimes or burn
1236,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,"Strange incense at the pillowed throne,"
1237,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Because no Elf was ever known
1238,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,To tread again where mortal man
1239,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Has been—nor any of the hybrid clan
1240,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,Who must have scampered out of there
1241,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,That day Elijah shot the bear.
1242,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1243,THE CAVES OF JOSEPHINE,
1244,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT
1245,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1246,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,When I was just a barefoot tike
1247,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,I used to wonder what ’twas like
1248,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Up there—oh way, way up—as high"
1249,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,As all those screaming gulls could fly—
1250,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,So white against the blue;
1251,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And where at evening too
1252,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The whippoorwills croaked, darted, swirled,"
1253,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,So far above my boyhood world.
1254,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1255,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Why, every youngster with two eyes"
1256,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Has had his dreams about the skies—
1257,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,My dreams have never quit
1258,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Although I’m getting on a bit,"
1259,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"So one day when it came, this chance,"
1260,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,I took it—over there in France.
1261,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1262,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Upholstered in
1263,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A furry skin—
1264,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"I think ’twas sheep, the coat,"
1265,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Or maybe cow or goat
1266,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And buckled snug round the throat,"
1267,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"With helmet, goggles—all the frills,"
1268,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A bird-man to the very quills;
1269,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1270,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,[Illustration:
1271,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1272,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"_The hills are flat, the roads are streaks,"
1273,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The rivers dwindle into creeks—
1274,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A crazy-quilt of gay brocades
1275,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And all the patches fields and glades._]
1276,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1277,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And thus I stood—they laughed,"
1278,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,While I was photographed.
1279,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And out before the hangar there
1280,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Our gleaming Lizzie of the air—
1281,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A dragon-fly—just poised to stay
1282,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A moment here and then away.
1283,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A little nick dug in her side
1284,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Where one might stick a toe, then slide"
1285,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Across the top and drop
1286,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Kerflop
1287,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,With one more roll
1288,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Into the cockpit cubby-hole—
1289,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,From here the young Observer chap
1290,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Snaps photographs and makes his map;
1291,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Since you have filled his place, you are"
1292,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Lord High Observer of your car!
1293,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1294,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The first thing you observe is not
1295,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,To let your feet or legs get caught
1296,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,In all those shifts and sliding gears
1297,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And lifts with which the Pilot steers,"
1298,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Yanks at the cranks and cable-things
1299,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That work the rudders and the wings;
1300,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And next, that life-belt should be placed"
1301,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Just sort of loosely ’round the waist—
1302,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Superfluous no doubt,"
1303,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,But handy when you’re falling out.
1304,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1305,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The noisy motor spits and tugs
1306,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"In little fits of chuggy-chugs,"
1307,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"With chuggy-chug—chug-chug—chug-chick,"
1308,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Now chug and chick come double quick—
1309,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The stench of petrol it exhales
1310,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"With reeking breath. The old prop’s flails,"
1311,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Like some titanic tabby’s purr,"
1312,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Churn ’round into a deafening whir.
1313,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Goliath! That’s the breed of her—
1314,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You’ll think so when you catch the stir
1315,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,She kicks behind her in her wake
1316,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That moment when she starts to make
1317,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Her lovely take-off—once they’ve wheeled
1318,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Her into line upon the field!
1319,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1320,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The Pilot, turning, cries “All set?”"
1321,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You grab like cripes and yell “You bet!”
1322,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The grinning ground-men wave good-bye,"
1323,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And gathering speed, the dragon-fly"
1324,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Moves on. The turf’s a blur—so swift
1325,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,It flashes by. You feel no lift
1326,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And yet you rise—you only know
1327,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You float by seeing there below
1328,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The earth receding, while the air"
1329,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Would gladly tear
1330,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The helmet from your goggled head.
1331,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You glimpse a house, a barn, a shed—"
1332,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You only know them by their tops—
1333,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The profile way of seeing stops.
1334,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The hills are flat, the roads are streaks,"
1335,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The rivers dwindle into creeks—
1336,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A crazy-quilt of gay brocades
1337,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And all the patches fields and glades.
1338,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And all around, the quilt is spanned"
1339,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"By vanishing horizon-land,"
1340,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Where fading contours disappear
1341,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,In wreaths of violet atmosphere
1342,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That gradually evolve into
1343,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That great inverted bowl of blue.
1344,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1345,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And are you dizzy? How absurd!
1346,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You’re not of earth—you are a bird.
1347,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You do not have that toppling feel
1348,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,When all beneath you seemed to reel
1349,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That day you peeped in timid fright
1350,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,From some cathedral’s pigmy height;
1351,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You are afloat on gleaming wings,"
1352,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Not propped up with terrestrial things.
1353,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1354,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,But look! Hold fast! With wicked tilt
1355,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"She’s swinging round. That crazy-quilt,"
1356,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The spreading earth, has dropped from view—"
1357,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Or so it seems somehow to you
1358,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Until your tangled vision sees
1359,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Fields and rivers, roads and trees,"
1360,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Barns and houses—little town,"
1361,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Smiling at you, looking down."
1362,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Another twist and there you view
1363,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The sprawling world out under you,"
1364,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,All right-side-up and in its place—
1365,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The play-ground of the human race—
1366,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Those insects whom you left to creep
1367,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And work and laugh and eat and sleep.
1368,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Perspectives do get twisted quite
1369,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,In making one’s initial flight!
1370,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1371,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,But swift! Low bridge! She mounts the loop!
1372,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You meet the onslaught with a stoop,"
1373,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And with her upward-moving course,"
1374,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You’re shoved against her with such force,"
1375,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That little seat you’re sticking to
1376,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Seems fairly crushing into you.
1377,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Then just as quickly, all has ceased,"
1378,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The sudden impact is released,"
1379,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You clutch to keep from dropping now,"
1380,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You clutch and wonder—marvel how
1381,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"She slowly crawls across the top,"
1382,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,She almost stalls—you think she’ll stop!
1383,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You wonder just how long ’twould take
1384,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,To make that trip should something break
1385,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Or slip,"
1386,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Or should you loose your grip—
1387,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And if you’d strike a church or what—
1388,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Or just some pleasant garden spot;
1389,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1390,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Perhaps you hope a kindly fate
1391,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Would cause you to evaporate
1392,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Into an atmospheric state—
1393,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"A sort of cosmic spirit-thing,"
1394,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And thus take wing, just fluttering,"
1395,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Up toward those pearly portals there,"
1396,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,So nonchalant and debonair—
1397,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Without all that formality
1398,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Of tumbling first into a tree!
1399,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1400,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,But see! She’s found an even keel
1401,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,At last. What joy to feel
1402,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That level glide—to know you’re still
1403,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"On board—until,"
1404,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Oh Lord! Another stunt!
1405,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You grab, you grunt,"
1406,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"But breathe you can’t,"
1407,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Her nose has struck a fiendish slant!
1408,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,That chuggy-chug—has it gone dead?
1409,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Or has the Pilot lost his head?
1410,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"He does not swerve, his aim’s exact,"
1411,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,He’s Hell-bent for that timber-tract!
1412,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Oh were there ever, ever trees"
1413,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,With such a prickly look as these?
1414,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"They’re coming closer up—and see,"
1415,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,They’re getting sharper—every tree!
1416,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1417,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Now look! She zooms! Agile she springs
1418,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Aloft with taut and straining wings.
1419,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,In one great climb she squanders all
1420,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,The power she gathered in her fall;
1421,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"She leaves the woodlands in her wake,"
1422,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"She cuts across a marshy lake,"
1423,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"And dipping gently, circles round"
1424,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Above the aviation ground,"
1425,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Where field-mechanics stand about
1426,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,To lend a hand and help you out—
1427,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,To ask you how you liked to drop
1428,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"Five thousand feet without a stop,"
1429,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And if the loop was all you thought
1430,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A loop would likely be or not?
1431,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,
1432,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You thank them—tell them all how glad
1433,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"You were to have the ride you had,"

1435,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"With some slight loss of appetite,"
1436,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,And with two rather wobbly pegs
1437,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"As proxies for your former legs,"
1438,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,You kick the turf up with your heel
1439,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,To reassure yourself it’s real—
1440,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"A little woozy still you feel,"
1441,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,A little dizzy—

1444,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,"The way we teased and tempted fate,"
1445,HOBNOBBING WITH THE FIRMAMENT,Shook off this earthly dust and went

1459,HEARTH-GLOW,Is somehow its inmost shrine.
1460,HEARTH-GLOW,
1461,HEARTH-GLOW,And the stones must come from the river’s bed—
1462,HEARTH-GLOW,"Softly colorful must they be,"
1463,HEARTH-GLOW,Like the long-dulled rose and the faded green
1464,HEARTH-GLOW,Of an old-time tapestry.
1465,HEARTH-GLOW,
1466,HEARTH-GLOW,And the light must fall with a fitful flare
1467,HEARTH-GLOW,On the logs in the lichened wall—

1469,HEARTH-GLOW,Once echoed the bluejay’s call.)
1470,HEARTH-GLOW,

1474,HEARTH-GLOW,The where of a woman’s hand.

1476,HEARTH-GLOW,And the fears that weighed till he grew afraid
1477,HEARTH-GLOW,Will be turned into nothingness

1482,HEARTH-GLOW,Out over the rainbow’s rim—
1483,HEARTH-GLOW,They will be more real than the stuff of dreams
1484,HEARTH-GLOW,Through her wonderful faith in him.
1485,HEARTH-GLOW,
1486,HEARTH-GLOW,And it’s this and that which the hearth gives back
1487,HEARTH-GLOW,"In the glow of the crackling pine,"
1488,HEARTH-GLOW,That endears the place to a man’s own soul
1489,HEARTH-GLOW,Till it’s somehow his inmost shrine.

1531,THE BELL,
1532,THE BELL,I am a cat and I am cruel!
1533,THE BELL,But beautiful! My fur
1534,THE BELL,Is soft. I have deep amber eyes
1535,THE BELL,And a most pleasing purr.
1536,THE BELL,I am a plaything for a child
1537,THE BELL,To pinch or squeeze or pull
1538,THE BELL,"Or to adore with soft caress,"
1539,THE BELL,For I am beautiful.
1540,THE BELL,
1541,THE BELL,I am a cat and I am cruel!
1542,THE BELL,"The upper Nile knew me,"
1543,THE BELL,"Roaming and wild. Then hunters came,"
1544,THE BELL,I was no longer free.
1545,THE BELL,"For Egypt had great granaries,"
1546,THE BELL,"So came a plague of rats,"
1547,THE BELL,They held us sacred like their gods
1548,THE BELL,For Egypt needed cats.
1549,THE BELL,
1550,THE BELL,I am a cat. Since Pharaoh’s day
1551,THE BELL,"I am what men call tame,"
1552,THE BELL,But deep in me the lust for gore
1553,THE BELL,Is lurking just the same.
1554,THE BELL,"Stroke me, I purr—my claws relax,"
1555,THE BELL,I drowse—but for all that
1556,THE BELL,"The murderer in me sleeps not,"
1557,THE BELL,"Sleeps not, for I’m a cat."

1560,THE BELL,"Blue-veined with snowy skin,"
1561,THE BELL,She smooths my fur and cuddles me
1562,THE BELL,Close to her dainty chin.
1563,THE BELL,An amorous perfume clings to
1564,THE BELL,Her soft gown’s silken mesh—
1565,THE BELL,I only want to smell her blood
1566,THE BELL,And eat her pretty flesh!
1567,THE BELL,
1568,THE BELL,I love to watch the agony
1569,THE BELL,"Of some affrighted thing,"
1570,THE BELL,"Life ebbing scarlet, bit by bit,"
1571,THE BELL,Through my slow torturing.
1572,THE BELL,"I am a cat—this is my life,"
1573,THE BELL,To be a pet until
1574,THE BELL,The age-long urge bestirs my soul
1575,THE BELL,And I go forth to kill.
1576,THE BELL,
1577,THE BELL,Through velvet black the paws of me
1578,THE BELL,Touch oh so soft and noiselessly.

1585,THE BELL,"For she has tied a bell on me,"
1586,THE BELL,"A bell—a bell—a bell on me,"
1587,THE BELL,"A tinkly bell to tell on me,"
1588,THE BELL,To tell—to tell—to tell on me;
1589,THE BELL,"The bell that foils each move I make,"
1590,THE BELL,"The bell that tells my prey awake,"
1591,THE BELL,The single dingle jingle-bell
1592,THE BELL,"The little tittle-tattle bell,"

1598,GOSSIP,
1599,GOSSIP,You’ve never heard Bill Sunday speak?
1600,GOSSIP,No more had I until last week.
1601,GOSSIP,"Yes, every mother’s son"
1602,GOSSIP,"Was there—bar none,"
1603,GOSSIP,And women folks—the kids all came
1604,GOSSIP,Just like it was a baseball game!
1605,GOSSIP,"Up to the grove on Dobson’s Hill,"
1606,GOSSIP,And there was Bill—
1607,GOSSIP,"Thumpin’, jumpin’, hell-fire Bill"
1608,GOSSIP,Right from his ranch to spill
1609,GOSSIP,Religion till we’d drunk our fill.
1610,GOSSIP,
1611,GOSSIP,"Well say,"
1612,GOSSIP,Since Bill let loose that day
1613,GOSSIP,There’s not a kid ’round here for miles
1614,GOSSIP,But what can juggle more new styles
1615,GOSSIP,"Of double-jointed, back-talk stuff"
1616,GOSSIP,And compound cursin’ guff
1617,GOSSIP,Than they’d have picked up with their ears
1618,GOSSIP,In twenty years
1619,GOSSIP,"From other folks. But to resume,"
1620,GOSSIP,Bill started on the temperance boom!
1621,GOSSIP,Statistics? Gosh! Blood-curdlin’ tales—
1622,GOSSIP,"He had ’em stacked ’round there in bales,"
1623,GOSSIP,"With starvin’ children, murdered wives,"
1624,GOSSIP,And drunken males with guns and knives.
1625,GOSSIP,
1626,GOSSIP,The way Bill talked you would have thought
1627,GOSSIP,Our Valley here had gone to pot
1628,GOSSIP,And ruin from the curse of drink.
1629,GOSSIP,But what I think
1630,GOSSIP,Is mostly wrong with this here place
1631,GOSSIP,Is just a simple case
1632,GOSSIP,Of scandal!
1633,GOSSIP,"Why, drinkin’ doesn’t hold a candle"
1634,GOSSIP,To all the dirty mess that’s stirred
1635,GOSSIP,With every slanderous word
1636,GOSSIP,That’s rolled along—and every time
1637,GOSSIP,"It’s shoved a bit, it gathers slime."
1638,GOSSIP,When certain people get together
1639,GOSSIP,It ain’t the weather
1640,GOSSIP,Worries them! Not much! It’s who the heck
1641,GOSSIP,Deserves it hardest in the neck!
1642,GOSSIP,
1643,GOSSIP,I’ve read somewhere how they could hear
1644,GOSSIP,A little whisper ringin’ clear
1645,GOSSIP,Across the dome
1646,GOSSIP,Of old St. Peter’s there in Rome.
1647,GOSSIP,"Well, I have heard a whisper go"
1648,GOSSIP,From Hillman’s ranch down there below
1649,GOSSIP,"The base-line road, to Eric Lane’s"
1650,GOSSIP,"Then shoot across and hit MacGrain’s,"
1651,GOSSIP,From where it kept on bouncin’ till
1652,GOSSIP,"It struck the Hendricks on the hill,"
1653,GOSSIP,"Then glanced and hit our house kerzip,"
1654,GOSSIP,Two days exactly on the trip!
1655,GOSSIP,"Though whisperin’s good down there in Rome,"
1656,GOSSIP,We’ve some acoustics here at home.
1657,GOSSIP,
1658,GOSSIP,"Accordin’ to Amanda Higgins,"
1659,GOSSIP,Jim Gillan’s wild on Mrs. Wiggins;
1660,GOSSIP,That’s why Jim’s wife goes ’round so white
1661,GOSSIP,And frets her heart out day and night.
1662,GOSSIP,Accordin’ to Matilda Blink
1663,GOSSIP,“That teacher last year used to drink—
1664,GOSSIP,"She roamed at will with Ruf MacGrore,"
1665,GOSSIP,Who was immoral to the core;
1666,GOSSIP,That car Zeb Brinker bought for Blanche
1667,GOSSIP,"Meant one more mortgage on their ranch,"
1668,GOSSIP,"While Hiram Tyler, he sets back"
1669,GOSSIP,And drives the same old squeaky hack
1670,GOSSIP,And makes his wife and daughters face
1671,GOSSIP,Shame and disgrace—
1672,GOSSIP,Old Hiram who has laid away
1673,GOSSIP,Enough to pay
1674,GOSSIP,For twenty cars—
1675,GOSSIP,My stars!”
1676,GOSSIP,So runs the gospel link by link
1677,GOSSIP,Accordin’ to Matilda Blink.
1678,GOSSIP,
1679,GOSSIP,Of course you can’t gainsay the claim
1680,GOSSIP,That some small flame
1681,GOSSIP,Of truth might be
1682,GOSSIP,"Where gossip’s smoke blows ’round so free,"
1683,GOSSIP,But oh the misery that’s begun
1684,GOSSIP,When each poor family skeleton
1685,GOSSIP,Is wakened from its peaceful trance
1686,GOSSIP,And made to dance
1687,GOSSIP,A shandigee
1688,GOSSIP,For all the blame community.
1689,GOSSIP,
1690,GOSSIP,What’s wanted most around this place
1691,GOSSIP,Is supernatural grace.
1692,GOSSIP,If we could find
1693,GOSSIP,Some heavenly-antiseptic kind
1694,GOSSIP,Of moral mouth-wash that would take
1695,GOSSIP,A slanderous tongue and make
1696,GOSSIP,It CLEAN—and God knows there
1697,GOSSIP,Would have to be enough to spare
1698,GOSSIP,"For all of us—both wives and men,"
1699,GOSSIP,To take a gargle now and then—
1700,GOSSIP,If we could ever hope
1701,GOSSIP,"To find that kind of dope,"
1702,GOSSIP,Our little parson on the hill
1703,GOSSIP,"As well as Bill,"
1704,GOSSIP,Could save a precious pile
1705,GOSSIP,Of energy and rest a while.

1710,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"John had the “con,” the Doctor said."
1711,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,He stayed around the house and read
1712,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,Most of the time or worked at such
1713,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,Chores as would not exert him much
1714,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,And slept on the veranda where
1715,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,The Doctor thought was better air.
1716,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,
1717,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,Each little thing the family knew
1718,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"Would make him happier, they’d do."
1719,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"“He won’t be with us long,” they’d say,"
1720,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"Then scrap and wrangle on, the way"
1721,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"That families do when rounding curves,"
1722,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,Each getting on the other’s nerves
1723,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"With back-bite, spit-fire—loading full"

1725,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,
1726,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"At times of utmost unction, Bill"
1727,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,Would be the goat—on him they’d spill
1728,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,The general peeve and blame. Bill stood
1729,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,The gaff to help the common good.
1730,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,One day Bill up and got the flu
1731,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,And did what flu-folks sometimes do—
1732,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,
1733,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,He died. Three days was all he took.
1734,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,He lay there in a curtained nook;
1735,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,It hit them sort of by surprise
1736,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,"To see him there with calm, closed eyes"
1737,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,And flowers all ’round and all so still.
1738,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,They stood there looking down on Bill
1739,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,And sobbed as families do when caught
1740,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,So sudden like—they looked and thought
1741,LOVE’S LABOR LOST,Of all the times they’d given him Hell;

1754,THE HALF UNDONE,His hearth was warm—so was his bed

1763,THE HALF UNDONE,He left so many out that they
1764,THE HALF UNDONE,"Who shared his roof from day to day,"

1786,THE MAN WHO POISONS DOGS,"At that, he’s got a dog’s sense of what’s right"

2236,A DINO’S AURA,
2237,A DINO’S AURA,We’d had a rousing dinner of
2238,A DINO’S AURA,"Spaghetti and roast-lamb,"
2239,A DINO’S AURA,Substantially supported by
2240,A DINO’S AURA,A chowder made of clam.
2241,A DINO’S AURA,
2242,A DINO’S AURA,We talked about the morrow and
2243,A DINO’S AURA,"The perils of the hike,"
2244,A DINO’S AURA,About the snowy crater there
2245,A DINO’S AURA,And what it all was like.
2246,A DINO’S AURA,
2247,A DINO’S AURA,We got along to bergschrunds and
2248,A DINO’S AURA,"Erosion and seracs,"
2249,A DINO’S AURA,And that kind of queer explosion when
2250,A DINO’S AURA,A nervous serac cracks.
2251,A DINO’S AURA,
2252,A DINO’S AURA,We figured out how long ’twould take
2253,A DINO’S AURA,(We all submitted plans)
2254,A DINO’S AURA,To parcel-post a glacier’s ice
2255,A DINO’S AURA,By shipping it in cans.
2256,A DINO’S AURA,
2257,A DINO’S AURA,"We talked of starry nebulæ,"
2258,A DINO’S AURA,"Auroras, comets’ tails,"
2259,A DINO’S AURA,Toads found alive in sandstone rock
2260,A DINO’S AURA,And ice-imprisoned whales;
2261,A DINO’S AURA,
2262,A DINO’S AURA,Suspended animation and
2263,A DINO’S AURA,"The tribe of Dinosaurs,"
2264,A DINO’S AURA,(Just here the man from Tennessee
2265,A DINO’S AURA,Passed ’round some good cigars);
2266,A DINO’S AURA,
2267,A DINO’S AURA,We stated and we countered in
2268,A DINO’S AURA,A wordy-wise delirium
2269,A DINO’S AURA,About the reptile Dinosaur
2270,A DINO’S AURA,And mammal Dinotherium.
2271,A DINO’S AURA,
2272,A DINO’S AURA,In short we talked of everything
2273,A DINO’S AURA,That people talk about
2274,A DINO’S AURA,When sparring for a last word more
2275,A DINO’S AURA,To help the conflab out.
2276,A DINO’S AURA,
2277,A DINO’S AURA,"We sprawled a bit, we yawned and stretched,"
2278,A DINO’S AURA,We lumberingly arose
2279,A DINO’S AURA,And brought a most loquacious night
2280,A DINO’S AURA,Abruptly to a close.
2281,A DINO’S AURA,
2282,A DINO’S AURA,"A dozen moments afterwards,"
2283,A DINO’S AURA,A dozen drowsy heads
2284,A DINO’S AURA,Had hit a dozen pillows on
2285,A DINO’S AURA,A dozen downy beds.
2286,A DINO’S AURA,
2287,A DINO’S AURA,For prostrate with their hikings were
2288,A DINO’S AURA,A dozen pair of shanks
2289,A DINO’S AURA,As they slept the sleep of Vikings ’neath
2290,A DINO’S AURA,The wood-rat riddled planks.
2291,A DINO’S AURA,
2292,A DINO’S AURA,The old Inn shook and trembled with
2293,A DINO’S AURA,"A rat-a-tat-a-tat,"
2294,A DINO’S AURA,As all the blustering four winds blew
2295,A DINO’S AURA,Like Great Jehoshaphat—
2296,A DINO’S AURA,
2297,A DINO’S AURA,"Like Blazes blew and Blitzen, banged"
2298,A DINO’S AURA,The window-sash till sud-
2299,A DINO’S AURA,denly the thing just opened with
2300,A DINO’S AURA,One gosh-almighty thud.
2301,A DINO’S AURA,
2302,A DINO’S AURA,Then quickly—as if conscious of
2303,A DINO’S AURA,"Such ill-timed, boorish riot,"
2304,A DINO’S AURA,"Those shrieking, spiteful, frightful winds"
2305,A DINO’S AURA,Became most meek and quiet;
2306,A DINO’S AURA,
2307,A DINO’S AURA,"And in the lull there rolled a dull,"
2308,A DINO’S AURA,Strange gurgle in my ear
2309,A DINO’S AURA,And through the window-space I saw
2310,A DINO’S AURA,A monstrous thing appear—
2311,A DINO’S AURA,
2312,A DINO’S AURA,"A snow-white critter, giant-high,"
2313,A DINO’S AURA,With trunk and pussy’s paws—
2314,A DINO’S AURA,In short his make-up seemed exempt
2315,A DINO’S AURA,From all of Nature’s laws.
2316,A DINO’S AURA,
2317,A DINO’S AURA,"A husky, tusky Titan growth"
2318,A DINO’S AURA,"With squidgy, squinty eyes—"
2319,A DINO’S AURA,I drew the covers closer up—
2320,A DINO’S AURA,The creature said “Arise!”
2321,A DINO’S AURA,
2322,A DINO’S AURA,"“Not so, old Scout,” I squiddled out,"
2323,A DINO’S AURA,“Bed’s good enough for me!”
2324,A DINO’S AURA,"His trunk moved slowly toward my bunk,"
2325,A DINO’S AURA,The monster said “We’ll see!”
2326,A DINO’S AURA,
2327,A DINO’S AURA,“Then who are you and what’s your game?”
2328,A DINO’S AURA,(I tried to be as calm as
2329,A DINO’S AURA,A man can be while shivering
2330,A DINO’S AURA,In only silk pajamas.)
2331,A DINO’S AURA,
2332,A DINO’S AURA,"“To thus intrude your presence rude,"
2333,A DINO’S AURA,You big Albino cur!”
2334,A DINO’S AURA,"“What’s that!” said he, “You don’t know me—"
2335,A DINO’S AURA,"I am a Dino, Sir!”"
2336,A DINO’S AURA,
2337,A DINO’S AURA,“A Dinosaur? The heck you are!
2338,A DINO’S AURA,From your get-up I’ll swan
2339,A DINO’S AURA,You’re what our scientific sharks
2340,A DINO’S AURA,Have dubbed a Mastodon!
2341,A DINO’S AURA,
2342,A DINO’S AURA,"A rare, old wooly specimen"
2343,A DINO’S AURA,’Mongst fossil Pachyderms!”
2344,A DINO’S AURA,"“For what they claim I’m not to blame,"
2345,A DINO’S AURA,I have no knack at terms;
2346,A DINO’S AURA,
2347,A DINO’S AURA,"“I only know I say what’s so,"
2348,A DINO’S AURA,A Dino’s what I be—
2349,A DINO’S AURA,Because your experts get things wrong—
2350,A DINO’S AURA,That doesn’t bother me.
2351,A DINO’S AURA,
2352,A DINO’S AURA,“I am a Dino—or to be
2353,A DINO’S AURA,"A little more exact,"
2354,A DINO’S AURA,"I am a Dino’s aura, Sir!"
2355,A DINO’S AURA,A Dino’s ghost in fact!
2356,A DINO’S AURA,
2357,A DINO’S AURA,“I overheard your talk tonight
2358,A DINO’S AURA,About our ancient clan—
2359,A DINO’S AURA,"I grew absorbed, I got a hunch,"
2360,A DINO’S AURA,Thinks I ‘At last—my man!’
2361,A DINO’S AURA,
2362,A DINO’S AURA,“You spoke of ice-imprisoned whales—
2363,A DINO’S AURA,Oh little did you know
2364,A DINO’S AURA,The way that touched my heart that pulsed
2365,A DINO’S AURA,A million years ago—
2366,A DINO’S AURA,
2367,A DINO’S AURA,“My other heart that lies so still
2368,A DINO’S AURA,Within my frozen fur—
2369,A DINO’S AURA,My other heart upon the hill
2370,A DINO’S AURA,Deep in yon glacier.
2371,A DINO’S AURA,
2372,A DINO’S AURA,“Oh could I break that crystal mold
2373,A DINO’S AURA,Where I’ve been doomed to freeze
2374,A DINO’S AURA,Down in that gloom and bitter cold
2375,A DINO’S AURA,"For untold centuries,"
2376,A DINO’S AURA,
2377,A DINO’S AURA,"“I’m sure my heart would pulse again,"
2378,A DINO’S AURA,"Those haunches limber grow,"
2379,A DINO’S AURA,And I could roam as once I did—
2380,A DINO’S AURA,Once in the Long-ago!
2381,A DINO’S AURA,
2382,A DINO’S AURA,"“There is an ice-cave known to none,"
2383,A DINO’S AURA,"Leads to that Mausoleum,"
2384,A DINO’S AURA,And he that was that other me
2385,A DINO’S AURA,Rests there where you shall see him.
2386,A DINO’S AURA,
2387,A DINO’S AURA,“So come and look—perhaps you could
2388,A DINO’S AURA,Evolve some keen device
2389,A DINO’S AURA,To extricate my stiffened shanks
2390,A DINO’S AURA,"From out that flux of ice,"
2391,A DINO’S AURA,
2392,A DINO’S AURA,"“And I will bear you back, I swear,"
2393,A DINO’S AURA,"As I’m a Dino’s spirit,"
2394,A DINO’S AURA,To this here shack before the crack
2395,A DINO’S AURA,Of daylight—never fear it!”
2396,A DINO’S AURA,
2397,A DINO’S AURA,“But Brother—” here you will observe
2398,A DINO’S AURA,"How friendly we’d become,"
2399,A DINO’S AURA,“For me to go up there tonight
2400,A DINO’S AURA,With You—is going Some!
2401,A DINO’S AURA,
2402,A DINO’S AURA,“And such a task! What could I do?
2403,A DINO’S AURA,’Twould weigh so mighty on
2404,A DINO’S AURA,My mortal shoulders—and besides
2405,A DINO’S AURA,I’ve but my nightie on!”
2406,A DINO’S AURA,
2407,A DINO’S AURA,"“Why don’t you see” replied the wraith,"
2408,A DINO’S AURA,“What faith I’ve got in you—
2409,A DINO’S AURA,Who’d parcel-post a glacier’s ice
2410,A DINO’S AURA,In cans—what can’t you do?
2411,A DINO’S AURA,
2412,A DINO’S AURA,“Some high explosive you could get
2413,A DINO’S AURA,Like dynamite and blow
2414,A DINO’S AURA,Me out from all my frigid plight—
2415,A DINO’S AURA,"It could be done, I know.”"
2416,A DINO’S AURA,
2417,A DINO’S AURA,"“It could be done,” I said, “but then"
2418,A DINO’S AURA,The risk you run is heightened—
2419,A DINO’S AURA,The dyna-MITE blow bones and all—
2420,A DINO’S AURA,And then again it mightn’t!”
2421,A DINO’S AURA,
2422,A DINO’S AURA,I looked to see—perhaps the pun
2423,A DINO’S AURA,Had punched his ponderous thinker—
2424,A DINO’S AURA,"His countenance was passive quite,"
2425,A DINO’S AURA,He never winked a blinker.
2426,A DINO’S AURA,
2427,A DINO’S AURA,"But then his wraithy nut, I ween,"
2428,A DINO’S AURA,"Was shadow-celled—not solid,"
2429,A DINO’S AURA,"Hence this hiatus in his bean,"
2430,A DINO’S AURA,His manner grave and stolid.
2431,A DINO’S AURA,
2432,A DINO’S AURA,“This dynamiting Dinos is
2433,A DINO’S AURA,Quite risky in the main—
2434,A DINO’S AURA,Although you haven’t much to lose
2435,A DINO’S AURA,And quite a bit to gain!”
2436,A DINO’S AURA,
2437,A DINO’S AURA,"“I’ll chance it—come!” the Dino said,"
2438,A DINO’S AURA,“There’s little time to lose—
2439,A DINO’S AURA,"We ghosts you know, can only romp"
2440,A DINO’S AURA,While other people snooze.”
2441,A DINO’S AURA,
2442,A DINO’S AURA,"His trunk galumpled toward my bunk,"
2443,A DINO’S AURA,"It snoodled till it found me,"
2444,A DINO’S AURA,Then with a firm but gentle squeeze
2445,A DINO’S AURA,It wrapped itself around me;
2446,A DINO’S AURA,
2447,A DINO’S AURA,It lifted me into the air
2448,A DINO’S AURA,Out toward the window-sash—
2449,A DINO’S AURA,The lamp upon the table there
2450,A DINO’S AURA,"Fell with a telltale crash,"
2451,A DINO’S AURA,
2452,A DINO’S AURA,"Which roused my next-door neighbor up,"
2453,A DINO’S AURA,"The man from Tennessee,"
2454,A DINO’S AURA,Who with his light came rushing in
2455,A DINO’S AURA,To learn what it could be.
2456,A DINO’S AURA,
2457,A DINO’S AURA,Of course no wraith can stand the light—
2458,A DINO’S AURA,It must have made him sore
2459,A DINO’S AURA,To have his trunk dissolve in night
2460,A DINO’S AURA,While I sprawled on the floor.
2461,A DINO’S AURA,
2462,A DINO’S AURA,As for the man from Tennessee
2463,A DINO’S AURA,And what had just occurred—
2464,A DINO’S AURA,"With me in my pajamas there,"
2465,A DINO’S AURA,I told him not a word.
2466,A DINO’S AURA,
2467,A DINO’S AURA,I told him nothing for I knew
2468,A DINO’S AURA,He’d never understand—
2469,A DINO’S AURA,I asked him just to get a rag
2470,A DINO’S AURA,And wrap my bruiséd hand.

2473,JUST CAT,JUST CAT
2474,JUST CAT,
2475,JUST CAT,We have a cat of common gray—
2476,JUST CAT,In fact a plain and everyday
2477,JUST CAT,Old Tab—to be exact I’d say
2478,JUST CAT,She’s common in most every way.
2479,JUST CAT,
2480,JUST CAT,"She’s common in her manners quite,"
2481,JUST CAT,"She’s never known the word “polite,”"
2482,JUST CAT,"When dining with her neighbors, _might_"
2483,JUST CAT,To her cat mind is always _right_.
2484,JUST CAT,
2485,JUST CAT,She’s common in her diet too—
2486,JUST CAT,"Cheese, liver, milk, or cold beef-stew—"
2487,JUST CAT,"And when at last she finds she’s through,"
2488,JUST CAT,She licks her chops as most cats do.
2489,JUST CAT,
2490,JUST CAT,She’s common for the reason that
2491,JUST CAT,"No chipmunk, gopher, mouse or rat"
2492,JUST CAT,Is sure she won’t cave in his slat
2493,JUST CAT,To decorate our kitchen-mat.
2494,JUST CAT,
2495,JUST CAT,She’s common in the way she’ll toy
2496,JUST CAT,With life—decoy and then annoy
2497,JUST CAT,"And torture with cool, fiendish joy"
2498,JUST CAT,The thing she would at last destroy.
2499,JUST CAT,
2500,JUST CAT,She’s common in the motherly
2501,JUST CAT,Devotion with which she can see
2502,JUST CAT,Her kits lick up the blood—to be
2503,JUST CAT,Eventually as cruel as she.
2504,JUST CAT,
2505,JUST CAT,She’s common in the attitude
2506,JUST CAT,Which she’s persistently pursued
2507,JUST CAT,Toward rearing up a meowing brood—
2508,JUST CAT,Twice every year the stunt’s renewed.
2509,JUST CAT,
2510,JUST CAT,She’s common in the view she’d share
2511,JUST CAT,With all those poor folks who declare
2512,JUST CAT,That the community should care
2513,JUST CAT,For all the young they choose to bear.
2514,JUST CAT,
2515,JUST CAT,"Indeed so common is she here,"
2516,JUST CAT,That should we count each little dear
2517,JUST CAT,"That’s littered every fiscal year,"
2518,JUST CAT,"(Her seventh winter’s drawing near),"
2519,JUST CAT,
2520,JUST CAT,"Allowing six to every score,"
2521,JUST CAT,"(At times it’s less but mostly more),"
2522,JUST CAT,The tally would not figure lower
2523,JUST CAT,Than somewhere say—near eighty-four.
2524,JUST CAT,
2525,JUST CAT,But as four out of every six
2526,JUST CAT,Are ferried ’cross the River Styx
2527,JUST CAT,And swiftly rendered good for nix
2528,JUST CAT,"Before they register their kicks,"
2529,JUST CAT,
2530,JUST CAT,And whereas those that still remain
2531,JUST CAT,In order to relieve the strain
2532,JUST CAT,And thus assuage a mother’s pain
2533,JUST CAT,"Until her grief is on the wane,"
2534,JUST CAT,
2535,JUST CAT,"Are likewise held beneath the spout,"
2536,JUST CAT,Or soon or later parcelled out
2537,JUST CAT,To someone who beyond a doubt
2538,JUST CAT,"Enjoys the feel of cats about,"
2539,JUST CAT,
2540,JUST CAT,It will be fitting to observe
2541,JUST CAT,That we have done our best to serve
2542,JUST CAT,This purring matron through each curve
2543,JUST CAT,"Of her plain, boundless, common nerve."
2544,JUST CAT,
2545,JUST CAT,"We’ve done our best—as one may see,"
2546,JUST CAT,"To quell each base antipathy,"
2547,JUST CAT,That she—our Tab might still be free

2638,THE FOREST,"Between the Heavens and the Earth,"
2639,THE FOREST,That there shall be no dearth
2640,THE FOREST,Of water nor excess—yet still enough
2641,THE FOREST,Stored in our forest floor of matted duff

2657,THE FOREST,Old patriarchs make way
2658,THE FOREST,"For jostling, upstart youth and gay,"
2659,THE FOREST,Bepainted courtezans and those who weep
2660,THE FOREST,With trailing tears; and anchorites who keep
2661,THE FOREST,Their solitary trysts; and those who sing;
2662,THE FOREST,And gossips bent in whispering;
2663,THE FOREST,"Defiant wretches of the sod,"
2664,THE FOREST,Hurling invective at their God;
2665,THE FOREST,Or those whose arms in priestly-wise
2666,THE FOREST,"Turn supplicating to the skies,"
2667,THE FOREST,Or stoop to bless
2668,THE FOREST,With benediction and caress;
2669,THE FOREST,And gnarled hags
2670,THE FOREST,And misshaped monsters of the crags;
2671,THE FOREST,And moon-white hosts
2672,THE FOREST,Of beckoning ghosts.
2673,THE FOREST,
2674,THE FOREST,"With wild, spendthrift magnificence"
2675,THE FOREST,The stage is set—immense
2676,THE FOREST,And primal. Flash
2677,THE FOREST,"And flood and thunder-crash,"
2678,THE FOREST,Devouring flame and scattered dead
2679,THE FOREST,And silences that hang like lead.

2753,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,It was to see a tree so fine

2755,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,His portly tons increased with age
2756,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,"While I sprawled in the cellarage,"
2757,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,And when winds tossed his noble head
2758,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,"I knew how shallow was my bed,"
2759,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,For in my youth I led
2760,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,"A rambling life, quite free from toil;"

2771,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,Once now and then some minstrel breezes strolled

2782,A SPRUCE’S ROOT,A crack! A bump!

3070,THE TIMBER-LINE,THE TIMBER-LINE
3071,THE TIMBER-LINE,
3072,THE TIMBER-LINE,We were not meant for forest life—
3073,THE TIMBER-LINE,Not we! we chose the strife
3074,THE TIMBER-LINE,Of high adventure—took our luck
3075,THE TIMBER-LINE,Here on the rocks and here we’ve stuck
3076,THE TIMBER-LINE,We are the pigmies of the spurs—
3077,THE TIMBER-LINE,The little warriors!
3078,THE TIMBER-LINE,
3079,THE TIMBER-LINE,"Perched on these crags, we hurled"
3080,THE TIMBER-LINE,Our challenge to the world.
3081,THE TIMBER-LINE,The wind heard our defy
3082,THE TIMBER-LINE,And blew till all the sky
3083,THE TIMBER-LINE,Grew purply-black and thundery.
3084,THE TIMBER-LINE,"Uncommon wroth was he,"
3085,THE TIMBER-LINE,When like a rumbling blunderbuss
3086,THE TIMBER-LINE,"He tried to topple us,"
3087,THE TIMBER-LINE,But wallowed flat—we were too short
3088,THE TIMBER-LINE,To fall! And it was merry sport
3089,THE TIMBER-LINE,Upon our jagged floor
3090,THE TIMBER-LINE,To see him wrestling there; a score
3091,THE TIMBER-LINE,Of holds he tried and thought each bout
3092,THE TIMBER-LINE,Would tire us out.
3093,THE TIMBER-LINE,
3094,THE TIMBER-LINE,"Oh Lord,"
3095,THE TIMBER-LINE,The way he stormed and roared!
3096,THE TIMBER-LINE,Then desperate he tried to tear
3097,THE TIMBER-LINE,Us limb from limb—to wear
3098,THE TIMBER-LINE,"Us down upon his rack,"
3099,THE TIMBER-LINE,A-bending back
3100,THE TIMBER-LINE,"Our arms, so we would cry “enough!”"
3101,THE TIMBER-LINE,We were too _tough_
3102,THE TIMBER-LINE,To crack! Then came the snow—so light
3103,THE TIMBER-LINE,"At first, but soon its white"
3104,THE TIMBER-LINE,Dead weight in silence crept
3105,THE TIMBER-LINE,Upon our shoulders and we slept
3106,THE TIMBER-LINE,"The sleep that no spring wakes,"
3107,THE TIMBER-LINE,"But only summer breaks,"
3108,THE TIMBER-LINE,When with her melting hand she takes
3109,THE TIMBER-LINE,Our blankets off and shakes
3110,THE TIMBER-LINE,The dripping fleece into the flow
3111,THE TIMBER-LINE,Of rushing torrents far below.
3112,THE TIMBER-LINE,
3113,THE TIMBER-LINE,Thus we are stooped by weight of snows
3114,THE TIMBER-LINE,And twisted by each wind that blows;
3115,THE TIMBER-LINE,Our arms are gouged and shot
3116,THE TIMBER-LINE,By sharp-edged sands the winds have caught
3117,THE TIMBER-LINE,And driven home; our trunks are gashed
3118,THE TIMBER-LINE,"And riven where the lightning flashed,"
3119,THE TIMBER-LINE,"And little increase may we show,"
3120,THE TIMBER-LINE,So brief a season do we grow.
3121,THE TIMBER-LINE,Though Time’s attrition has been spent
3122,THE TIMBER-LINE,In our grotesque disfigurement.
3123,THE TIMBER-LINE,Still we can lift our flattened heads
3124,THE TIMBER-LINE,"In pride, for we are thoroughbreds."
3125,THE TIMBER-LINE,We have not flinched and we can show
3126,THE TIMBER-LINE,At what far heights a tree can grow.
3127,THE TIMBER-LINE,We are the pigmies of the spurs—
3128,THE TIMBER-LINE,The little warriors
3129,THE TIMBER-LINE,Who left the haunts of fir and pine
3130,THE TIMBER-LINE,To mark the topmost timber-line.

3244,TRANSITION,The kid—he rambled on;
3245,TRANSITION,"We sat, we two, by candle-light"
3246,TRANSITION,In a tavern in Ballon.
3247,TRANSITION,"“The first I killed—that hand-made dirk,"
3248,TRANSITION,Well that’s a souvenir!
3249,TRANSITION,"I got it cheap—though that poor Turk,"
3250,TRANSITION,It cost him pretty dear.
3251,TRANSITION,
3252,TRANSITION,“He’d jumped our trench—the fog was thick—
3253,TRANSITION,Thinks I—‘one of our men’
3254,TRANSITION,"Still I yelled ‘Halt!’—he beat it quick,"

3257,TRANSITION,He scrambled to the top—
3258,TRANSITION,"Says I—‘Not if I know it, Bill!’"
3259,TRANSITION,And then I saw him drop.

3261,TRANSITION,“Our First Lieutenant heard me blaze

3263,TRANSITION,I stood there in a kind of daze

3265,TRANSITION,
3266,TRANSITION,"I told him and he said ‘Good work,"
3267,TRANSITION,Suppose we have a look’—
3268,TRANSITION,"He yanked a button from the Turk,"
3269,TRANSITION,I showed you what I took.
3270,TRANSITION,
3271,TRANSITION,"“That night I tried and tried to pray,"

3273,TRANSITION,To pound away inside and say

3276,TRANSITION,In mud—the blood it ran—
3277,TRANSITION,Oh God—all night! while something said
3278,TRANSITION,‘Hey boy—you’ve killed a man!’
3279,TRANSITION,
3280,TRANSITION,“You’ll go to Hell—that’s where you’ll go”—
3281,TRANSITION,For once the kid was still—
3282,TRANSITION,"“It’s funny how it gets you so,"

3284,TRANSITION,"And yet—it’s just as funny too,"
3285,TRANSITION,How killin’ seems all right
3286,TRANSITION,"When hate gets jazzin’ ’round in you,"

3290,TRANSITION,Got blowed to Kingdom Come
3291,TRANSITION,When Fritzie’s steel plowed up the sod
3292,TRANSITION,Down there along the Somme.
3293,TRANSITION,
3294,TRANSITION,"My first machine-gun man stood there,"
3295,TRANSITION,As near as me to you—
3296,TRANSITION,It tore his head off clean and bare
3297,TRANSITION,And ripped his chest all through.

3303,TRANSITION,Another fell—I grabbed his gun
3304,TRANSITION,"And left him my canteen,"
3305,TRANSITION,And then I started in to run
3306,TRANSITION,Up toward a Boche machine.
3307,TRANSITION,
3308,TRANSITION,“I ducked around—for two more men
3309,TRANSITION,"That Jerry there had picked,"
3310,TRANSITION,Got in behind—and leveled when
3311,TRANSITION,The damned thing only clicked!
3312,TRANSITION,"Down went his hand, I saw his game,"
3313,TRANSITION,"He grabbed his Luger, but"
3314,TRANSITION,I swung my stock and down it came
3315,TRANSITION,Upon his bloomin’ nut.
3316,TRANSITION,
3317,TRANSITION,"“That there’s the souvenir I copped,"
3318,TRANSITION,Some pretty watch—eh what!

3320,TRANSITION,She’s Fritzie on the spot!

3323,TRANSITION,"Your poor old pal go West,"
3324,TRANSITION,With blood a-tricklin’ in the mud
3325,TRANSITION,And oozin’ from his chest.
3326,TRANSITION,
3327,TRANSITION,"“You carry on, you just don’t care,"
