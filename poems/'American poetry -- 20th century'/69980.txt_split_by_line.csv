45,FOREWORD,
46,FOREWORD,The A. E. F. was about the most sentimental outfit that ever lived. Most
47,FOREWORD,of it—so it seemed to anyone who served on the staff of _The Stars and
48,FOREWORD,"Stripes_—wrote poetry. All of it read poetry. “The Army’s Poets” column,"
49,FOREWORD,in which some hundred thousand lines of verse were printed during the
50,FOREWORD,"course of the Army newspaper’s existence, was re-read, cut out, sent"
51,FOREWORD,"home, pinned or pasted up in dugouts, Adrian barracks and mess shacks,"
52,FOREWORD,"laughed over and, in all likelihood, wept over."
53,FOREWORD,
54,FOREWORD,"It was good verse. Occasionally the metre was out of joint, the rhymes"
55,FOREWORD,"faulty, the whole mechanism awry, but it was good verse for all that."
56,FOREWORD,"For it rang true, every syllable of it, however the scansion may have"
57,FOREWORD,halted or the expression blundered. It was inspired by mud and cooties
58,FOREWORD,"and gas and mess-kits and Boche 77’s and home and mother, all"
59,FOREWORD,subordinated to a determination to stick it through whatever the time
60,FOREWORD,and pains involved.
61,FOREWORD,
62,FOREWORD,Various anthologies of war verse have appeared in America. Nearly all
63,FOREWORD,have consisted almost wholly of the work of non-combatant poets—indeed
64,FOREWORD,"of professionals—who wrote smoothly, visioned the horror with facile"
65,FOREWORD,"accuracy for what it was, and interpreted well—for people who didn’t get"
66,FOREWORD,to the war. _Yanks_ is the work of men who got there. It is a source
67,FOREWORD,book of A. E. F. emotion.
68,FOREWORD,
69,FOREWORD,_Yanks_ is composed entirely of selections from the verse published in
70,FOREWORD,_The Stars and Stripes_ during the nine months of its pre-armistice
71,FOREWORD,"career, and seven months before the Army newspaper, according to the"
72,FOREWORD,"pledge of its editors, was “folded away, never to be taken out again.”"
73,FOREWORD,The profits from the original edition were to have been used to buy
74,FOREWORD,fruit and delicacies for American sick and wounded in overseas
75,FOREWORD,"hospitals, and would have been but for the decision of the Judge"
76,FOREWORD,"Advocate General of the A. E. F. who, after the publication and sale of"
77,FOREWORD,"the volume, refused to permit the expenditure of the proceeds because of"
78,FOREWORD,a technicality.
79,FOREWORD,
80,FOREWORD,The royalties accruing from the sale of this volume will be devoted to
81,FOREWORD,"_The Stars and Stripes_ Fund for French War Orphans, to which 600,000"
82,FOREWORD,"American soldiers gave more than 2,200,000 francs during their stay in"
83,FOREWORD,France.

85,FOREWORD,This republication is made with the consent and approval of Newton D.
86,FOREWORD,"Baker, Secretary of War, under the direction of the former editorial"

1445,BILLETS,"I’ve chased the supple, leaping flea"
1446,BILLETS,"As o’er my outstretched form he sped,"
1447,BILLETS,And heard the sneering rooster’s crow
1448,BILLETS,When I chased the rabbit from my bed.
1449,BILLETS,"I’ve marked the dog’s contented growl,"
1450,BILLETS,"His wagging tail, his playful bite;"

1454,BILLETS,"Like curtains drapes the oaken beams,"
1455,BILLETS,The spiders skipped from place to place
1456,BILLETS,And sometimes dropped in on my dreams.
1457,BILLETS,"And when the morning, damp and raw,"
1458,BILLETS,"Arrived at last as if by chance,"

1462,BILLETS,And sometimes when the day is done
1463,BILLETS,"And lengthening shadows pointing long,"
1464,BILLETS,I dream of days when there was sun
1465,BILLETS,And street cars in my daily song.

1467,BILLETS,The clouds are German-silver lined—
1468,BILLETS,Who worries when we get the mange?
1469,BILLETS,What boots it if our shoes are shined?
1470,BILLETS,The day speeds by and night again
1471,BILLETS,Looms up a specter grim and bare;
1472,BILLETS,We trek off to the hen house then
1473,BILLETS,And climb the cross barred ladder there—
1474,BILLETS,Another biologic night
1475,BILLETS,"Spent in a state sans peace, sans sleep;"
1476,BILLETS,"And as I soothe some stinging bite,"
1477,BILLETS,"I mark the gentle smell of sheep,"
1478,BILLETS,"The smell that wots of grassy dell,"
1479,BILLETS,Of hillsides green where fairies dance....

1483,BILLETS,"We’ve slept with all the gander’s flock,"
1484,BILLETS,By waddling duck we’ve slumbered on—
1485,BILLETS,"In fact, we’ve slept with all the stock,"
1486,BILLETS,And they will miss us when we’re gone.
1487,BILLETS,We’ve seen at times the nocturne eyes
1488,BILLETS,"Of playful mouse on evening spree,"
1489,BILLETS,And the coastwise trade at night he plies
1490,BILLETS,With Brother Louse on a jamboree.
1491,BILLETS,"We’ve scratched and fought with foe unseen,"
1492,BILLETS,And with the candle hunted wide
1493,BILLETS,"For the bug that thrives on Paris green,"
1494,BILLETS,But cashes in on bichloride.
1495,BILLETS,
1496,BILLETS,"Perchance may come a night of stars,"
1497,BILLETS,"Perchance the snow drift through the tile,"
1498,BILLETS,Perchance the evil face of Mars
1499,BILLETS,Peeks in and shows his wicked smile;

1810,I,"There lie many fighting men,"

1818,I,And left them there—
1819,I,Clay to clay.

2643,BEFORE A DRIVE,And there had seen the magic of your smile.
