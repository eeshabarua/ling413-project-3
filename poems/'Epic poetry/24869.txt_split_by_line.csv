734,OM.(8),
735,OM.(8),"With him, his best and eldest son,"
736,OM.(8),By all his princely virtues won
737,OM.(8),King Dasaratha(24) willed to share
738,OM.(8),His kingdom as the Regent Heir.
739,OM.(8),"But when Kaikeyí, youngest queen,"
740,OM.(8),With eyes of envious hate had seen
741,OM.(8),The solemn pomp and regal state
742,OM.(8),"Prepared the prince to consecrate,"
743,OM.(8),She bade the hapless king bestow
744,OM.(8),"Two gifts he promised long ago,"
745,OM.(8),"That Ráma to the woods should flee,"
746,OM.(8),And that her child the heir should be.
747,OM.(8),
748,OM.(8),"By chains of duty firmly tied,"
749,OM.(8),The wretched king perforce complied.
750,OM.(8),"Ráma, to please Kaikeyí went"
751,OM.(8),Obedient forth to banishment.
752,OM.(8),"Then Lakshman's truth was nobly shown,"
753,OM.(8),"Then were his love and courage known,"
754,OM.(8),When for his brother's sake he dared
755,OM.(8),"All perils, and his exile shared."
756,OM.(8),"And Sítá, Ráma's darling wife,"
757,OM.(8),"Loved even as he loved his life,"
758,OM.(8),"Whom happy marks combined to bless,"
759,OM.(8),"A miracle of loveliness,"
760,OM.(8),"Of Janak's royal lineage sprung,"
761,OM.(8),"Most excellent of women, clung"
762,OM.(8),"To her dear lord, like Rohiní"
763,OM.(8),Rejoicing with the Moon to be.(25)
764,OM.(8),"The King and people, sad of mood,"
765,OM.(8),The hero's car awhile pursued.
766,OM.(8),But when Prince Ráma lighted down
767,OM.(8),"At Sringavera's pleasant town,"
768,OM.(8),"Where Gangá's holy waters flow,"
769,OM.(8),He bade his driver turn and go.
770,OM.(8),"Guha, Nishádas' king, he met,"
771,OM.(8),And on the farther bank was set.
772,OM.(8),"Then on from wood to wood they strayed,"
773,OM.(8),"O'er many a stream, through constant shade,"
774,OM.(8),"As Bharadvája bade them, till"
775,OM.(8),They came to Chitrakúta's hill.
776,OM.(8),"And Ráma there, with Lakshman's aid,"
777,OM.(8),"A pleasant little cottage made,"
778,OM.(8),"And spent his days with Sítá, dressed"
779,OM.(8),In coat of bark and deerskin vest.(26)
780,OM.(8),And Chitrakúta grew to be
781,OM.(8),As bright with those illustrious three
782,OM.(8),As Meru's(27) sacred peaks that shine
783,OM.(8),"With glory, when the Gods recline"
784,OM.(8),Beneath them: Siva's(28) self between
785,OM.(8),The Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen.
786,OM.(8),
787,OM.(8),"The aged king for Ráma pined,"
788,OM.(8),And for the skies the earth resigned.
789,OM.(8),"Bharat, his son, refused to reign,"
790,OM.(8),Though urged by all the twice-born(29) train.
791,OM.(8),Forth to the woods he fared to meet
792,OM.(8),"His brother, fell before his feet,"
793,OM.(8),"And cried, ""Thy claim all men allow:"
794,OM.(8),"O come, our lord and king be thou."""
795,OM.(8),But Ráma nobly chose to be
796,OM.(8),Observant of his sire's decree.
797,OM.(8),He placed his sandals(30) in his hand
798,OM.(8),A pledge that he would rule the land:
799,OM.(8),And bade his brother turn again.
800,OM.(8),"Then Bharat, finding prayer was vain,"
801,OM.(8),The sandals took and went away;
802,OM.(8),Nor in Ayodhyá would he stay.
803,OM.(8),"But turned to Nandigráma, where"
804,OM.(8),"He ruled the realm with watchful care,"
805,OM.(8),Still longing eagerly to learn
806,OM.(8),Tidings of Ráma's safe return.
807,OM.(8),
808,OM.(8),Then lest the people should repeat
809,OM.(8),"Their visit to his calm retreat,"
810,OM.(8),Away from Chitrakúta's hill
811,OM.(8),Fared Ráma ever onward till
812,OM.(8),Beneath the shady trees he stood
813,OM.(8),"Of Dandaká's primeval wood,"
814,OM.(8),"Virádha, giant fiend, he slew,"
815,OM.(8),And then Agastya's friendship knew.
816,OM.(8),Counselled by him he gained the sword
817,OM.(8),"And bow of Indra, heavenly lord:"
818,OM.(8),"A pair of quivers too, that bore"
819,OM.(8),Of arrows an exhaustless store.
820,OM.(8),While there he dwelt in greenwood shade
821,OM.(8),"The trembling hermits sought his aid,"
822,OM.(8),And bade him with his sword and bow
823,OM.(8),Destroy the fiends who worked them woe:
824,OM.(8),"To come like Indra strong and brave,"
825,OM.(8),A guardian God to help and save.
826,OM.(8),And Ráma's falchion left its trace
827,OM.(8),Deep cut on Súrpanakhá's face:
828,OM.(8),A hideous giantess who came
829,OM.(8),Burning for him with lawless flame.
830,OM.(8),Their sister's cries the giants heard.
831,OM.(8),And vengeance in each bosom stirred:
832,OM.(8),The monster of the triple head.
833,OM.(8),And Dúshan to the contest sped.
834,OM.(8),But they and myriad fiends beside
835,OM.(8),Beneath the might of Ráma died.
836,OM.(8),
837,OM.(8),"When Rávan, dreaded warrior, knew"
838,OM.(8),The slaughter of his giant crew:
839,OM.(8),"Rávan, the king, whose name of fear"
840,OM.(8),"Earth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:"
841,OM.(8),He bade the fiend Márícha aid
842,OM.(8),The vengeful plot his fury laid.
843,OM.(8),In vain the wise Márícha tried
844,OM.(8),To turn him from his course aside:
845,OM.(8),"Not Rávan's self, he said, might hope"
846,OM.(8),With Ráma and his strength to cope.
847,OM.(8),Impelled by fate and blind with rage
848,OM.(8),He came to Ráma's hermitage.
849,OM.(8),"There, by Márícha's magic art,"
850,OM.(8),"He wiled the princely youths apart,"
851,OM.(8),"The vulture(31) slew, and bore away"
852,OM.(8),The wife of Ráma as his prey.
853,OM.(8),The son of Raghu(32) came and found
854,OM.(8),Jatáyu slain upon the ground.
855,OM.(8),He rushed within his leafy cot;
856,OM.(8),"He sought his wife, but found her not."
857,OM.(8),"Then, then the hero's senses failed;"
858,OM.(8),In mad despair he wept and wailed.
859,OM.(8),"Upon the pile that bird he laid,"
860,OM.(8),And still in quest of Sítá strayed.
861,OM.(8),"A hideous giant then he saw,"
862,OM.(8),"Kabandha named, a shape of awe."
863,OM.(8),"The monstrous fiend he smote and slew,"
864,OM.(8),And in the flame the body threw;
865,OM.(8),When straight from out the funeral flame
866,OM.(8),"In lovely form Kabandha came,"
867,OM.(8),And bade him seek in his distress
868,OM.(8),A wise and holy hermitess.
869,OM.(8),By counsel of this saintly dame
870,OM.(8),"To Pampá's pleasant flood he came,"
871,OM.(8),And there the steadfast friendship won
872,OM.(8),Of Hanumán the Wind-God's son.
873,OM.(8),Counselled by him he told his grief
874,OM.(8),"To great Sugríva, Vánar chief,"
875,OM.(8),"Who, knowing all the tale, before"
876,OM.(8),The sacred flame alliance swore.
877,OM.(8),Sugríva to his new-found friend
878,OM.(8),Told his own story to the end:
879,OM.(8),His hate of Báli for the wrong
880,OM.(8),And insult he had borne so long.
881,OM.(8),And Ráma lent a willing ear
882,OM.(8),And promised to allay his fear.
883,OM.(8),Sugríva warned him of the might
884,OM.(8),"Of Báli, matchless in the fight,"
885,OM.(8),"And, credence for his tale to gain,"
886,OM.(8),Showed the huge fiend(33) by Báli slain.
887,OM.(8),The prostrate corse of mountain size
888,OM.(8),Seemed nothing in the hero's eyes;
889,OM.(8),"He lightly kicked it, as it lay,"
890,OM.(8),And cast it twenty leagues(34) away.
891,OM.(8),To prove his might his arrows through
892,OM.(8),"Seven palms in line, uninjured, flew."
893,OM.(8),"He cleft a mighty hill apart,"
894,OM.(8),And down to hell he hurled his dart.
895,OM.(8),"Then high Sugríva's spirit rose,"
896,OM.(8),Assured of conquest o'er his foes.
897,OM.(8),With his new champion by his side
898,OM.(8),To vast Kishkindhá's cave he hied.
899,OM.(8),"Then, summoned by his awful shout,"
900,OM.(8),"King Báli came in fury out,"
901,OM.(8),"First comforted his trembling wife,"
902,OM.(8),Then sought Sugríva in the strife.
903,OM.(8),One shaft from Ráma's deadly bow
904,OM.(8),The monarch in the dust laid low.
905,OM.(8),Then Ráma bade Sugríva reign
906,OM.(8),In place of royal Báli slain.
907,OM.(8),Then speedy envoys hurried forth
908,OM.(8),"Eastward and westward, south and north,"
909,OM.(8),Commanded by the grateful king
910,OM.(8),Tidings of Ráma's spouse to bring.
911,OM.(8),
912,OM.(8),"Then by Sampáti's counsel led,"
913,OM.(8),"Brave Hanumán, who mocked at dread,"
914,OM.(8),Sprang at one wild tremendous leap
915,OM.(8),Two hundred leagues across the deep.
916,OM.(8),"To Lanká's(35) town he urged his way,"
917,OM.(8),Where Rávan held his royal sway.
918,OM.(8),There pensive 'neath Asoka(36) boughs
919,OM.(8),"He found poor Sítá, Ráma's spouse."
920,OM.(8),"He gave the hapless girl a ring,"
921,OM.(8),A token from her lord and king.
922,OM.(8),A pledge from her fair hand he bore;
923,OM.(8),Then battered down the garden door.
924,OM.(8),"Five captains of the host he slew,"
925,OM.(8),Seven sons of councillors o'erthrew;
926,OM.(8),"Crushed youthful Aksha on the field,"
927,OM.(8),Then to his captors chose to yield.
928,OM.(8),"Soon from their bonds his limbs were free,"
929,OM.(8),But honouring the high decree
930,OM.(8),"Which Brahmá(37) had pronounced of yore,"
931,OM.(8),He calmly all their insults bore.
932,OM.(8),"The town he burnt with hostile flame,"
933,OM.(8),"And spoke again with Ráma's dame,"
934,OM.(8),Then swiftly back to Ráma flew
935,OM.(8),With tidings of the interview.
936,OM.(8),
937,OM.(8),"Then with Sugríva for his guide,"
938,OM.(8),Came Ráma to the ocean side.
939,OM.(8),He smote the sea with shafts as bright
940,OM.(8),"As sunbeams in their summer height,"
941,OM.(8),And quick appeared the Rivers' King(38)
942,OM.(8),Obedient to the summoning.
943,OM.(8),A bridge was thrown by Nala o'er
944,OM.(8),The narrow sea from shore to shore.(39)
945,OM.(8),"They crossed to Lanká's golden town,"
946,OM.(8),Where Ráma's hand smote Rávan down.
947,OM.(8),Vibhishan there was left to reign
948,OM.(8),Over his brother's wide domain.
949,OM.(8),To meet her husband Sítá came;
950,OM.(8),"But Ráma, stung with ire and shame,"
951,OM.(8),With bitter words his wife addressed
952,OM.(8),Before the crowd that round her pressed.
953,OM.(8),"But Sítá, touched with noble ire,"
954,OM.(8),Gave her fair body to the fire.
955,OM.(8),"Then straight the God of Wind appeared,"
956,OM.(8),And words from heaven her honour cleared.
957,OM.(8),"And Ráma clasped his wife again,"
958,OM.(8),"Uninjured, pure from spot and stain,"
959,OM.(8),Obedient to the Lord of Fire
960,OM.(8),And the high mandate of his sire.
961,OM.(8),"Led by the Lord who rules the sky,"
962,OM.(8),"The Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,"
963,OM.(8),"And honoured him with worthy meed,"
964,OM.(8),Rejoicing in each glorious deed.
965,OM.(8),"His task achieved, his foe removed,"
966,OM.(8),"He triumphed, by the Gods approved."
967,OM.(8),By grace of Heaven he raised to life
968,OM.(8),The chieftains slain in mortal strife;
969,OM.(8),Then in the magic chariot through
970,OM.(8),The clouds to Nandigráma flew.
971,OM.(8),"Met by his faithful brothers there,"
972,OM.(8),He loosed his votive coil of hair:
973,OM.(8),"Thence fair Ayodhyá's town he gained,"
974,OM.(8),And o'er his father's kingdom reigned.
975,OM.(8),Disease or famine ne'er oppressed
976,OM.(8),"His happy people, richly blest"
977,OM.(8),"With all the joys of ample wealth,"
978,OM.(8),Of sweet content and perfect health.
979,OM.(8),"No widow mourned her well-loved mate,"
980,OM.(8),No sire his son's untimely fate.
981,OM.(8),They feared not storm or robber's hand;
982,OM.(8),No fire or flood laid waste the land:
983,OM.(8),The Golden Age(40) had come again
984,OM.(8),To bless the days of Ráma's reign.
985,OM.(8),
986,OM.(8),"From him, the great and glorious king,"
987,OM.(8),Shall many a princely scion spring.
988,OM.(8),"And he shall rule, beloved by men,"
989,OM.(8),"Ten thousand years and hundreds ten,(41)"
990,OM.(8),And when his life on earth is past
991,OM.(8),"To Brahmá's world shall go at last."""
992,OM.(8),
993,OM.(8),Whoe'er this noble poem reads
994,OM.(8),"That tells the tale of Ráma's deeds,"
995,OM.(8),"Good as the Scriptures, he shall be"
996,OM.(8),From every sin and blemish free.
997,OM.(8),"Whoever reads the saving strain,"
998,OM.(8),With all his kin the heavens shall gain.
999,OM.(8),Bráhmans who read shall gather hence
1000,OM.(8),The highest praise for eloquence.
1001,OM.(8),"The warrior, o'er the land shall reign,"
1002,OM.(8),"The merchant, luck in trade obtain;"
1003,OM.(8),And Súdras listening(42) ne'er shall fail
1004,OM.(8),To reap advantage from the tale.(43)
1005,OM.(8),
1006,OM.(8),
1007,OM.(8),
1008,OM.(8),
1009,OM.(8),Canto II. Brahmá's Visit
1010,OM.(8),
1011,OM.(8),
1012,OM.(8),"Válmíki, graceful speaker, heard,"
1013,OM.(8),To highest admiration stirred.
1014,OM.(8),To him whose fame the tale rehearsed
1015,OM.(8),He paid his mental worship first;
1016,OM.(8),Then with his pupil humbly bent
1017,OM.(8),Before the saint most eloquent.
1018,OM.(8),Thus honoured and dismissed the seer
1019,OM.(8),Departed to his heavenly sphere.
1020,OM.(8),Then from his cot Válmíki hied
1021,OM.(8),"To Tamasá's(44) sequestered side,"
1022,OM.(8),Not far remote from Gangá's tide.
1023,OM.(8),He stood and saw the ripples roll
1024,OM.(8),Pellucid o'er a pebbly shoal.
1025,OM.(8),To Bharadvája(45) by his side
1026,OM.(8),"He turned in ecstasy, and cried:"
1027,OM.(8),"""See, pupil dear, this lovely sight,"
1028,OM.(8),"The smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright,"
1029,OM.(8),"With not a speck or shade to mar,"
1030,OM.(8),And clear as good men's bosoms are.
1031,OM.(8),"Here on the brink thy pitcher lay,"
1032,OM.(8),"And bring my zone of bark, I pray."
1033,OM.(8),"Here will I bathe: the rill has not,"
1034,OM.(8),"To lave the limbs, a fairer spot."
1035,OM.(8),"Do quickly as I bid, nor waste"
1036,OM.(8),"The precious time; away, and haste."""
1037,OM.(8),
1038,OM.(8),Obedient to his master's hest
1039,OM.(8),Quick from the cot he brought the vest;
1040,OM.(8),"The hermit took it from his hand,"
1041,OM.(8),And tightened round his waist the band;
1042,OM.(8),"Then duly dipped and bathed him there,"
1043,OM.(8),And muttered low his secret prayer.
1044,OM.(8),To spirits and to Gods he made
1045,OM.(8),"Libation of the stream, and strayed"
1046,OM.(8),Viewing the forest deep and wide
1047,OM.(8),That spread its shade on every side.
1048,OM.(8),Close by the bank he saw a pair
1049,OM.(8),Of curlews sporting fearless there.
1050,OM.(8),But suddenly with evil mind
1051,OM.(8),"An outcast fowler stole behind,"
1052,OM.(8),"And, with an aim too sure and true,"
1053,OM.(8),The male bird near the hermit slew.
1054,OM.(8),The wretched hen in wild despair
1055,OM.(8),"With fluttering pinions beat the air,"
1056,OM.(8),And shrieked a long and bitter cry
1057,OM.(8),"When low on earth she saw him lie,"
1058,OM.(8),"Her loved companion, quivering, dead,"
1059,OM.(8),His dear wings with his lifeblood red;
1060,OM.(8),And for her golden crested mate
1061,OM.(8),"She mourned, and was disconsolate."
1062,OM.(8),
1063,OM.(8),"The hermit saw the slaughtered bird,"
1064,OM.(8),And all his heart with ruth was stirred.
1065,OM.(8),The fowler's impious deed distressed
1066,OM.(8),"His gentle sympathetic breast,"
1067,OM.(8),And while the curlew's sad cries rang
1068,OM.(8),"Within his ears, the hermit sang:"
1069,OM.(8),"""No fame be thine for endless time,"
1070,OM.(8),"Because, base outcast, of thy crime,"
1071,OM.(8),Whose cruel hand was fain to slay
1072,OM.(8),"One of this gentle pair at play!"""
1073,OM.(8),E'en as he spoke his bosom wrought
1074,OM.(8),And laboured with the wondering thought
1075,OM.(8),What was the speech his ready tongue
1076,OM.(8),Had uttered when his heart was wrung.
1077,OM.(8),"He pondered long upon the speech,"
1078,OM.(8),"Recalled the words and measured each,"
1079,OM.(8),And thus exclaimed the saintly guide
1080,OM.(8),To Bharadvája by his side:
1081,OM.(8),"""With equal lines of even feet,"
1082,OM.(8),"With rhythm and time and tone complete,"
1083,OM.(8),The measured form of words I spoke
1084,OM.(8),"In shock of grief be termed a sloke.""(46)"
1085,OM.(8),"And Bharadvája, nothing slow"
1086,OM.(8),"His faithful love and zeal to show,"
1087,OM.(8),"Answered those words of wisdom, ""Be"
1088,OM.(8),"The name, my lord, as pleases thee."""
1089,OM.(8),
1090,OM.(8),As rules prescribe the hermit took
1091,OM.(8),Some lustral water from the brook.
1092,OM.(8),But still on this his constant thought
1093,OM.(8),"Kept brooding, as his home he sought;"
1094,OM.(8),"While Bharadvája paced behind,"
1095,OM.(8),"A pupil sage of lowly mind,"
1096,OM.(8),And in his hand a pitcher bore
1097,OM.(8),With pure fresh water brimming o'er.
1098,OM.(8),Soon as they reached their calm retreat
1099,OM.(8),The holy hermit took his seat;
1100,OM.(8),"His mind from worldly cares recalled,"
1101,OM.(8),And mused in deepest thought enthralled.
1102,OM.(8),
1103,OM.(8),"Then glorious Brahmá,(47) Lord Most High,"
1104,OM.(8),"Creator of the earth and sky,"
1105,OM.(8),"The four-faced God, to meet the sage"
1106,OM.(8),Came to Válmíki's hermitage.
1107,OM.(8),"Soon as the mighty God he saw,"
1108,OM.(8),Up sprang the saint in wondering awe.
1109,OM.(8),"Mute, with clasped hands, his head he bent,"
1110,OM.(8),And stood before him reverent.
1111,OM.(8),"His honoured guest he greeted well,"
1112,OM.(8),Who bade him of his welfare tell;
1113,OM.(8),"Gave water for his blessed feet,"
1114,OM.(8),"Brought offerings,(48) and prepared a seat."
1115,OM.(8),In honoured place the God Most High
1116,OM.(8),"Sate down, and bade the saint sit nigh."
1117,OM.(8),There sate before Válmíki's eyes
1118,OM.(8),The Father of the earth and skies;
1119,OM.(8),But still the hermit's thoughts were bent
1120,OM.(8),"On one thing only, all intent"
1121,OM.(8),On that poor curlew's mournful fate
1122,OM.(8),Lamenting for her slaughtered mate;
1123,OM.(8),"And still his lips, in absent mood,"
1124,OM.(8),"The verse that told his grief, renewed:"
1125,OM.(8),"""Woe to the fowler's impious hand"
1126,OM.(8),That did the deed that folly planned;
1127,OM.(8),That could to needless death devote
1128,OM.(8),"The curlew of the tuneful throat!"""
1129,OM.(8),
1130,OM.(8),"The heavenly Father smiled in glee,"
1131,OM.(8),"And said, ""O best of hermits, see,"
1132,OM.(8),"A verse, unconscious, thou hast made;"
1133,OM.(8),No longer be the task delayed.
1134,OM.(8),"Seek not to trace, with labour vain,"
1135,OM.(8),The unpremeditated strain.
1136,OM.(8),The tuneful lines thy lips rehearsed
1137,OM.(8),Spontaneous from thy bosom burst.
1138,OM.(8),"Then come, O best of seers, relate"
1139,OM.(8),"The life of Ráma good and great,"
1140,OM.(8),"The tale that saintly Nárad told,"
1141,OM.(8),In all its glorious length unfold.
1142,OM.(8),Of all the deeds his arm has done
1143,OM.(8),"Upon this earth, omit not one,"
1144,OM.(8),And thus the noble life record
1145,OM.(8),"Of that wise, brave, and virtuous lord."
1146,OM.(8),"His every act to day displayed,"
1147,OM.(8),His secret life to none betrayed:
1148,OM.(8),"How Lakshman, how the giants fought;"
1149,OM.(8),With high emprise and hidden thought:
1150,OM.(8),And all that Janak's child(49) befell
1151,OM.(8),"Where all could see, where none could tell."
1152,OM.(8),The whole of this shall truly be
1153,OM.(8),"Made known, O best of saints, to thee."
1154,OM.(8),"In all thy poem, through my grace,"
1155,OM.(8),No word of falsehood shall have place.
1156,OM.(8),"Begin the story, and rehearse"
1157,OM.(8),The tale divine in charming verse.
1158,OM.(8),As long as in this firm-set land
1159,OM.(8),"The streams shall flow, the mountains stand,"
1160,OM.(8),"So long throughout the world, be sure,"
1161,OM.(8),The great Rámáyan shall endure.(50)
1162,OM.(8),While the Rámáyan's ancient strain
1163,OM.(8),"Shall glorious in the earth remain,"
1164,OM.(8),To higher spheres shalt thou arise
1165,OM.(8),"And dwell with me above the skies."""
1166,OM.(8),
1167,OM.(8),"He spoke, and vanished into air,"
1168,OM.(8),And left Válmíki wondering there.
1169,OM.(8),"The pupils of the holy man,"
1170,OM.(8),"Moved by their love of him, began"
1171,OM.(8),"To chant that verse, and ever more"
1172,OM.(8),They marvelled as they sang it o'er:
1173,OM.(8),"""Behold, the four-lined balanced rime,"
1174,OM.(8),"Repeated over many a time,"
1175,OM.(8),In words that from the hermit broke
1176,OM.(8),"In shock of grief, becomes a sloke."""
1177,OM.(8),This measure now Válmíki chose
1178,OM.(8),Wherein his story to compose.
1179,OM.(8),"In hundreds of such verses, sweet"
1180,OM.(8),"With equal lines and even feet,"
1181,OM.(8),"The saintly poet, lofty-souled,"
1182,OM.(8),The glorious deeds of Ráma told.
1183,OM.(8),
1184,OM.(8),
1185,OM.(8),
1186,OM.(8),
1187,OM.(8),Canto III. The Argument.
1188,OM.(8),
1189,OM.(8),
1190,OM.(8),The hermit thus with watchful heed
1191,OM.(8),"Received the poem's pregnant seed,"
1192,OM.(8),And looked with eager thought around
1193,OM.(8),If fuller knowledge might be found.
1194,OM.(8),"His lips with water first bedewed,(51)"
1195,OM.(8),"He sate, in reverent attitude"
1196,OM.(8),"On holy grass,(52) the points all bent"
1197,OM.(8),Together toward the orient;(53)
1198,OM.(8),And thus in meditation he
1199,OM.(8),Entered the path of poesy.
1200,OM.(8),"Then clearly, through his virtue's might,"
1201,OM.(8),"All lay discovered to his sight,"
1202,OM.(8),"Whate'er befell, through all their life,"
1203,OM.(8),"Ráma, his brother, and his wife:"
1204,OM.(8),And Dasaratha and each queen
1205,OM.(8),"At every time, in every scene:"
1206,OM.(8),"His people too, of every sort;"
1207,OM.(8),The nobles of his princely court:
1208,OM.(8),"Whate'er was said, whate'er decreed,"
1209,OM.(8),Each time they sate each plan and deed:
1210,OM.(8),For holy thought and fervent rite
1211,OM.(8),Had so refined his keener sight
1212,OM.(8),That by his sanctity his view
1213,OM.(8),"The present, past, and future knew,"
1214,OM.(8),"And he with mental eye could grasp,"
1215,OM.(8),"Like fruit within his fingers clasp,"
1216,OM.(8),"The life of Ráma, great and good,"
1217,OM.(8),Roaming with Sítá in the wood.
1218,OM.(8),"He told, with secret-piercing eyes,"
1219,OM.(8),"The tale of Ráma's high emprise,"
1220,OM.(8),"Each listening ear that shall entice,"
1221,OM.(8),A sea of pearls of highest price.
1222,OM.(8),"Thus good Válmíki, sage divine,"
1223,OM.(8),"Rehearsed the tale of Raghu's line,"
1224,OM.(8),"As Nárad, heavenly saint, before"
1225,OM.(8),Had traced the story's outline o'er.
1226,OM.(8),"He sang of Ráma's princely birth,"
1227,OM.(8),His kindness and heroic worth;
1228,OM.(8),"His love for all, his patient youth,"
1229,OM.(8),"His gentleness and constant truth,"
1230,OM.(8),And many a tale and legend old
1231,OM.(8),By holy Visvámitra told.
1232,OM.(8),"How Janak's child he wooed and won,"

1234,OM.(8),How he with every virtue fraught
1235,OM.(8),His namesake Ráma(54) met and fought.
1236,OM.(8),The choice of Ráma for the throne;
1237,OM.(8),"The malice by Kaikeyí shown,"
1238,OM.(8),Whose evil counsel marred the plan
1239,OM.(8),And drove him forth a banisht man.
1240,OM.(8),"How the king grieved and groaned, and cried,"
1241,OM.(8),And swooned away and pining died.
1242,OM.(8),The subjects' woe when thus bereft;
1243,OM.(8),And how the following crowds he left:
1244,OM.(8),"With Guha talked, and firmly stern"
1245,OM.(8),Ordered his driver to return.
1246,OM.(8),How Gangá's farther shore he gained;
1247,OM.(8),"By Bharadvája entertained,"
1248,OM.(8),By whose advice he journeyed still
1249,OM.(8),And came to Chitrakúta's hill.
1250,OM.(8),How there he dwelt and built a cot;
1251,OM.(8),How Bharat journeyed to the spot;
1252,OM.(8),His earnest supplication made;
1253,OM.(8),Drink-offerings to their father paid;

1257,OM.(8),And years in Nandigráma spent.
1258,OM.(8),How Ráma entered Dandak wood
1259,OM.(8),And in Sutíkhna's presence stood.
1260,OM.(8),"The favour Anasúyá showed,"
1261,OM.(8),The wondrous balsam she bestowed.
1262,OM.(8),How Sarabhanga's dwelling-place
1263,OM.(8),They sought; saw Indra face to face;

1265,OM.(8),The heavenly bow from him obtained.
1266,OM.(8),How Ráma with Virádha met;

1278,OM.(8),"Met Hanumán, and her whose vows"
1279,OM.(8),Were kept beneath the greenwood boughs.
1280,OM.(8),"How Raghu's son, the lofty-souled,"
1281,OM.(8),"On Pampá's bank wept uncontrolled,"

1307,OM.(8),"To chambers where the women lay,"

1312,OM.(8),How Sítá gave a gem o'erjoyed;

1359,OM.(8),"As thus he mused with anxious breast,"

1368,OM.(8),"With lore divine, to these he taught:"
1369,OM.(8),The lay whose verses sweet and clear
1370,OM.(8),"Take with delight the listening ear,"
1371,OM.(8),That tell of Sítá's noble life
1372,OM.(8),And Rávan's fall in battle strife.
1373,OM.(8),"Great joy to all who hear they bring,"
1374,OM.(8),Sweet to recite and sweet to sing.

1376,OM.(8),"And triple measure,(57) wrought with care"
1377,OM.(8),"With melody and tone and time,"
1378,OM.(8),And flavours(58) that enhance the rime;

1386,OM.(8),"The poem that his lips outpoured,"
1387,OM.(8),"Válmíki kissed them on the head,"
1388,OM.(8),"As at his feet they bowed, and said;"
1389,OM.(8),"""Recite ye this heroic song"
1390,OM.(8),In tranquil shades where sages throng:
1391,OM.(8),"Recite it where the good resort,"
1392,OM.(8),"In lowly home and royal court."""
1393,OM.(8),
1394,OM.(8),"The hermit ceased. The tuneful pair,"
1395,OM.(8),"Like heavenly minstrels sweet and fair,"
1396,OM.(8),"In music's art divinely skilled,"
1397,OM.(8),Their saintly master's word fulfilled.
1398,OM.(8),"Like Ráma's self, from whom they came,"
1399,OM.(8),"They showed their sire in face and frame,"
1400,OM.(8),As though from some fair sculptured stone
1401,OM.(8),Two selfsame images had grown.
1402,OM.(8),"Sometimes the pair rose up to sing,"
1403,OM.(8),"Surrounded by a holy ring,"
1404,OM.(8),Where seated on the grass had met
1405,OM.(8),Full many a musing anchoret.
1406,OM.(8),"Then tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,"
1407,OM.(8),"As transport took them and surprise,"
1408,OM.(8),And as they listened every one
1409,OM.(8),"Cried in delight, Well done! Well done!"
1410,OM.(8),Those sages versed in holy lore
1411,OM.(8),Praised the sweet minstrels more and more:
1412,OM.(8),"And wondered at the singers' skill,"
1413,OM.(8),"And the bard's verses sweeter still,"
1414,OM.(8),Which laid so clear before the eye
1415,OM.(8),The glorious deeds of days gone by.
1416,OM.(8),"Thus by the virtuous hermits praised,"
1417,OM.(8),Inspirited their voice they raised.
1418,OM.(8),Pleased with the song this holy man
1419,OM.(8),Would give the youths a water-can;
1420,OM.(8),"One gave a fair ascetic dress,"
1421,OM.(8),Or sweet fruit from the wilderness.
1422,OM.(8),"One saint a black-deer's hide would bring,"
1423,OM.(8),And one a sacrificial string:
1424,OM.(8),"One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,"
1425,OM.(8),"And one, a twisted munja cord.(59)"
1426,OM.(8),"One in his joy an axe would find,"
1427,OM.(8),"One braid, their plaited locks to bind."
1428,OM.(8),"One gave a sacrificial cup,"
1429,OM.(8),One rope to tie their fagots up;
1430,OM.(8),"While fuel at their feet was laid,"
1431,OM.(8),Or hermit's stool of fig-tree made.
1432,OM.(8),"All gave, or if they gave not, none"
1433,OM.(8),Forgot at least a benison.
1434,OM.(8),"Some saints, delighted with their lays,"
1435,OM.(8),Would promise health and length of days;
1436,OM.(8),Others with surest words would add
1437,OM.(8),Some boon to make their spirit glad.
1438,OM.(8),In such degree of honour then
1439,OM.(8),That song was held by holy men:
1440,OM.(8),"That living song which life can give,"
1441,OM.(8),By which shall many a minstrel live.
1442,OM.(8),"In seat of kings, in crowded hall,"
1443,OM.(8),"They sang the poem, praised of all."
1444,OM.(8),"And Ráma chanced to hear their lay,"
1445,OM.(8),"While he the votive steed(60) would slay,"
1446,OM.(8),And sent fit messengers to bring
1447,OM.(8),The minstrel pair before the king.
1448,OM.(8),"They came, and found the monarch high"
1449,OM.(8),"Enthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;"
1450,OM.(8),"While many a minister below,"
1451,OM.(8),"And noble, sate in lengthened row."
1452,OM.(8),The youthful pair awhile he viewed
1453,OM.(8),"Graceful in modest attitude,"
1454,OM.(8),And then in words like these addressed
1455,OM.(8),His brother Lakshman and the rest:
1456,OM.(8),"""Come, listen to the wondrous strain"
1457,OM.(8),"Recited by these godlike twain,"
1458,OM.(8),Sweet singers of a story fraught
1459,OM.(8),"With melody and lofty thought."""
1460,OM.(8),
1461,OM.(8),"The pair, with voices sweet and strong,"
1462,OM.(8),"Rolled the full tide of noble song,"
1463,OM.(8),With tone and accent deftly blent
1464,OM.(8),To suit the changing argument.
1465,OM.(8),Mid that assembly loud and clear
1466,OM.(8),"Rang forth that lay so sweet to hear,"
1467,OM.(8),That universal rapture stole
1468,OM.(8),Through each man's frame and heart and soul.
1469,OM.(8),"""These minstrels, blest with every sign"
1470,OM.(8),"That marks a high and princely line,"
1471,OM.(8),"In holy shades who dwell,"
1472,OM.(8),"Enshrined in Saint Válmíki's lay,"
1473,OM.(8),"A monument to live for aye,"
1474,OM.(8),"My deeds in song shall tell."""
1475,OM.(8),"Thus Ráma spoke: their breasts were fired,"
1476,OM.(8),"And the great tale, as if inspired,"
1477,OM.(8),"The youths began to sing,"
1478,OM.(8),"While every heart with transport swelled,"

1489,OM.(8),Were ever brave and mighty-souled.
1490,OM.(8),The land their arms had made their own
1491,OM.(8),Was bounded by the sea alone.
1492,OM.(8),"Their holy works have won them praise,"

1496,OM.(8),With sixty thousand sons to throng

1498,OM.(8),From them this glorious tale proceeds:
1499,OM.(8),The great Rámáyan tells their deeds.
1500,OM.(8),This noble song whose lines contain
1501,OM.(8),"Lessons of duty, love, and gain,"

1510,OM.(8),"Ayodhyá(63) stands, the royal town,"
1511,OM.(8),In bygone ages built and planned

1519,OM.(8),Right glorious is her royal street
1520,OM.(8),Where streams allay the dust and heat.
1521,OM.(8),On level ground in even row
1522,OM.(8),Her houses rise in goodly show:
1523,OM.(8),"Terrace and palace, arch and gate"
1524,OM.(8),The queenly city decorate.
1525,OM.(8),"High are her ramparts, strong and vast,"

1543,OM.(8),To festival and dance and song.
1544,OM.(8),"A mine is she of gems and sheen,"

1588,OM.(8),Well read in Scripture's holy page:
1589,OM.(8),"Upon his kingdom's weal intent,"
1590,OM.(8),Mighty and brave and provident;
1591,OM.(8),The pride of old Ikshváku's seed
1592,OM.(8),For lofty thought and righteous deed.
1593,OM.(8),"Peer of the saints, for virtues famed,"
1594,OM.(8),For foes subdued and passions tamed:
1595,OM.(8),A rival in his wealth untold
1596,OM.(8),Of Indra and the Lord of Gold.
1597,OM.(8),"Like Manu first of kings, he reigned,"
1598,OM.(8),And worthily his state maintained.
1599,OM.(8),For firm and just and ever true
1600,OM.(8),"Love, duty, gain he kept in view,"
1601,OM.(8),"And ruled his city rich and free,"
1602,OM.(8),Like Indra's Amarávatí.
1603,OM.(8),And worthy of so fair a place
1604,OM.(8),There dwelt a just and happy race
1605,OM.(8),With troops of children blest.
1606,OM.(8),"Each man contented sought no more,"
1607,OM.(8),Nor longed with envy for the store
1608,OM.(8),By richer friends possessed.
1609,OM.(8),"For poverty was there unknown,"
1610,OM.(8),And each man counted as his own
1611,OM.(8),"Kine, steeds, and gold, and grain."
1612,OM.(8),"All dressed in raiment bright and clean,"

1614,OM.(8),"With earrings, wreath, or chain."
1615,OM.(8),"None deigned to feed on broken fare,"
1616,OM.(8),And none was false or stingy there.
1617,OM.(8),"A piece of gold, the smallest pay,"
1618,OM.(8),Was earned by labour for a day.
1619,OM.(8),"On every arm were bracelets worn,"
1620,OM.(8),"And none was faithless or forsworn,"
1621,OM.(8),A braggart or unkind.
1622,OM.(8),"None lived upon another's wealth,"
1623,OM.(8),"None pined with dread or broken health,"
1624,OM.(8),Or dark disease of mind.
1625,OM.(8),"High-souled were all. The slanderous word,"
1626,OM.(8),"The boastful lie, were never heard."
1627,OM.(8),"Each man was constant to his vows,"
1628,OM.(8),And lived devoted to his spouse.
1629,OM.(8),"No other love his fancy knew,"
1630,OM.(8),"And she was tender, kind, and true."
1631,OM.(8),"Her dames were fair of form and face,"
1632,OM.(8),"With charm of wit and gentle grace,"
1633,OM.(8),"With modest raiment simply neat,"
1634,OM.(8),And winning manners soft and sweet.
1635,OM.(8),"The twice-born sages, whose delight"
1636,OM.(8),"Was Scripture's page and holy rite,"
1637,OM.(8),"Their calm and settled course pursued,"
1638,OM.(8),Nor sought the menial multitude.
1639,OM.(8),"In many a Scripture each was versed,"
1640,OM.(8),"And each the flame of worship nursed,"
1641,OM.(8),And gave with lavish hand.
1642,OM.(8),"Each paid to Heaven the offerings due,"
1643,OM.(8),And none was godless or untrue
1644,OM.(8),In all that holy band.
1645,OM.(8),"To Bráhmans, as the laws ordain,"
1646,OM.(8),The Warrior caste were ever fain
1647,OM.(8),The reverence due to pay;
1648,OM.(8),"And these the Vaisyas' peaceful crowd,"
1649,OM.(8),"Who trade and toil for gain, were proud"
1650,OM.(8),To honour and obey;
1651,OM.(8),"And all were by the Súdras(70) served,"
1652,OM.(8),"Who never from their duty swerved,"

1657,OM.(8),"Cheered by his grandsons, sons, and wife,"
1658,OM.(8),Each passed a long and happy life.
1659,OM.(8),Thus was that famous city held
1660,OM.(8),"By one who all his race excelled,"
1661,OM.(8),"Blest in his gentle reign,"
1662,OM.(8),As the whole land aforetime swayed
1663,OM.(8),"By Manu, prince of men, obeyed"
1664,OM.(8),Her king from main to main.
1665,OM.(8),"And heroes kept her, strong and brave,"
1666,OM.(8),As lions guard their mountain cave:
1667,OM.(8),"Fierce as devouring flame they burned,"
1668,OM.(8),"And fought till death, but never turned."
1669,OM.(8),"Horses had she of noblest breed,"
1670,OM.(8),"Like Indra's for their form and speed,"
1671,OM.(8),"From Váhlí's(72) hills and Sindhu's(73) sand,"
1672,OM.(8),Vanáyu(74) and Kámboja's land.(75)
1673,OM.(8),Her noble elephants had strayed
1674,OM.(8),"Through Vindhyan and Himálayan shade,"
1675,OM.(8),"Gigantic in their bulk and height,"
1676,OM.(8),Yet gentle in their matchless might.
1677,OM.(8),They rivalled well the world-spread fame
1678,OM.(8),"Of the great stock from which they came,"
1679,OM.(8),"Of Váman, vast of size,"
1680,OM.(8),"Of Mahápadma's glorious line,"

1685,OM.(8),"Whom men Matangas name,"
1686,OM.(8),"And Mrigas spotted black and white,"
1687,OM.(8),"And Bhadras of unwearied might,"
1688,OM.(8),And Mandras hard to tame.(77)
1689,OM.(8),"Thus, worthy of the name she bore,(78)"
1690,OM.(8),Ayodhyá for a league or more
1691,OM.(8),"Cast a bright glory round,"
1692,OM.(8),Where Dasaratha wise and great
1693,OM.(8),"Governed his fair ancestral state,"
1694,OM.(8),With every virtue crowned.
1695,OM.(8),Like Indra in the skies he reigned
1696,OM.(8),In that good town whose wall contained
1697,OM.(8),"High domes and turrets proud,"
1698,OM.(8),"With gates and arcs of triumph decked,"

1706,OM.(8),
1707,OM.(8),
1708,OM.(8),"Two sages, holy saints, had he,"
1709,OM.(8),His ministers and priests to be:
1710,OM.(8),"Vasishtha, faithful to advise,"
1711,OM.(8),"And Vámadeva, Scripture-wise."
1712,OM.(8),"Eight other lords around him stood,"
1713,OM.(8),"All skilled to counsel, wise and good:"
1714,OM.(8),"Jayanta, Vijay, Dhrishti bold"
1715,OM.(8),"In fight, affairs of war controlled:"
1716,OM.(8),Siddhárth and Arthasádhak true
1717,OM.(8),"Watched o'er expense and revenue,"
1718,OM.(8),And Dharmapál and wise Asok
1719,OM.(8),Of right and law and justice spoke.
1720,OM.(8),"With these the sage Sumantra, skilled"
1721,OM.(8),"To urge the car, high station filled."
1722,OM.(8),All these in knowledge duly trained
1723,OM.(8),Each passion and each sense restrained:
1724,OM.(8),"With modest manners, nobly bred"
1725,OM.(8),"Each plan and nod and look they read,"
1726,OM.(8),"Upon their neighbours' good intent,"
1727,OM.(8),Most active and benevolent:
1728,OM.(8),"As sit the Vasus(79) round their king,"
1729,OM.(8),They sate around him counselling.
1730,OM.(8),They ne'er in virtue's loftier pride
1731,OM.(8),Another's lowly gifts decried.
1732,OM.(8),"In fair and seemly garb arrayed,"
1733,OM.(8),No weak uncertain plans they made.
1734,OM.(8),"Well skilled in business, fair and just,"
1735,OM.(8),"They gained the people's love and trust,"
1736,OM.(8),And thus without oppression stored
1737,OM.(8),The swelling treasury of their lord.
1738,OM.(8),"Bound in sweet friendship each to each,"
1739,OM.(8),They spoke kind thoughts in gentle speech.
1740,OM.(8),They looked alike with equal eye
1741,OM.(8),"On every caste, on low and high."
1742,OM.(8),"Devoted to their king, they sought,"
1743,OM.(8),"Ere his tongue spoke, to learn his thought,"
1744,OM.(8),"And knew, as each occasion rose,"
1745,OM.(8),To hide their counsel or disclose.
1746,OM.(8),In foreign lands or in their own
1747,OM.(8),"Whatever passed, to them was known."
1748,OM.(8),By secret spies they timely knew
1749,OM.(8),What men were doing or would do.
1750,OM.(8),Skilled in the grounds of war and peace
1751,OM.(8),"They saw the monarch's state increase,"
1752,OM.(8),Watching his weal with conquering eye
1753,OM.(8),"That never let occasion by,"
1754,OM.(8),While nature lent her aid to bless
1755,OM.(8),Their labours with unbought success.
1756,OM.(8),"Never for anger, lust, or gain,"
1757,OM.(8),Would they their lips with falsehood stain.
1758,OM.(8),Inclined to mercy they could scan
1759,OM.(8),The weakness and the strength of man.
1760,OM.(8),"They fairly judged both high and low,"
1761,OM.(8),And ne'er would wrong a guiltless foe;
1762,OM.(8),"Yet if a fault were proved, each one"
1763,OM.(8),Would punish e'en his own dear son.
1764,OM.(8),But there and in the kingdom's bound
1765,OM.(8),No thief or man impure was found:
1766,OM.(8),"None of loose life or evil fame,"
1767,OM.(8),No tempter of another's dame.
1768,OM.(8),Contented with their lot each caste
1769,OM.(8),Calm days in blissful quiet passed;
1770,OM.(8),"And, all in fitting tasks employed,"
1771,OM.(8),"Country and town deep rest enjoyed,"
1772,OM.(8),With these wise lords around his throne
1773,OM.(8),"The monarch justly reigned,"
1774,OM.(8),And making every heart his own
1775,OM.(8),The love of all men gained.
1776,OM.(8),"With trusty agents, as beseems,"
1777,OM.(8),"Each distant realm he scanned,"
1778,OM.(8),As the sun visits with his beams
1779,OM.(8),Each corner of the land.
1780,OM.(8),Ne'er would he on a mightier foe
1781,OM.(8),"With hostile troops advance,"
1782,OM.(8),Nor at an equal strike a blow
1783,OM.(8),In war's delusive chance.
1784,OM.(8),These lords in council bore their part
1785,OM.(8),"With ready brain and faithful heart,"
1786,OM.(8),"With skill and knowledge, sense and tact,"
1787,OM.(8),Good to advise and bold to act.
1788,OM.(8),And high and endless fame he won
1789,OM.(8),"With these to guide his schemes,"
1790,OM.(8),"As, risen in his might, the sun"
1791,OM.(8),Wins glory with his beams.

1799,OM.(8),"But splendid, just, and great of mind,"
1800,OM.(8),The childless king for offspring pined.
1801,OM.(8),"No son had he his name to grace,"
1802,OM.(8),Transmitter of his royal race.
1803,OM.(8),"Long had his anxious bosom wrought,"
1804,OM.(8),And as he pondered rose the thought:
1805,OM.(8),"""A votive steed 'twere good to slay,"
1806,OM.(8),"So might a son the gift repay."""
1807,OM.(8),"Before his lords his plan he laid,"
1808,OM.(8),And bade them with their wisdom aid:
1809,OM.(8),"Then with these words Sumantra, best"
1810,OM.(8),"Of royal counsellors, addressed:"
1811,OM.(8),"""Hither, Vasishtha at their head,"
1812,OM.(8),"Let all my priestly guides be led."""
1813,OM.(8),To him Sumantra made reply:
1814,OM.(8),"""Hear, Sire, a tale of days gone by."
1815,OM.(8),"To many a sage in time of old,"
1816,OM.(8),"Sanatkumár, the saint, foretold"
1817,OM.(8),"How from thine ancient line, O King,"
1818,OM.(8),"A son, when years came round, should spring."
1819,OM.(8),"""Here dwells,"" 'twas thus the seer began,"
1820,OM.(8),"""Of Kasyap's(80) race, a holy man,"
1821,OM.(8),Vibhándak named: to him shall spring
1822,OM.(8),"A son, the famous Rishyasring."
1823,OM.(8),"Bred with the deer that round him roam,"
1824,OM.(8),The wood shall be that hermit's home.
1825,OM.(8),To him no mortal shall be known
1826,OM.(8),Except his holy sire alone.
1827,OM.(8),Still by those laws shall he abide
1828,OM.(8),"Which lives of youthful Bráhmans guide,"
1829,OM.(8),Obedient to the strictest rule
1830,OM.(8),That forms the young ascetic's school:
1831,OM.(8),And all the wondering world shall hear
1832,OM.(8),Of his stern life and penance drear;
1833,OM.(8),His care to nurse the holy fire
1834,OM.(8),And do the bidding of his sire.
1835,OM.(8),"Then, seated on the Angas'(81) throne,"
1836,OM.(8),Shall Lomapád to fame be known.
1837,OM.(8),But folly wrought by that great king
1838,OM.(8),A plague upon the land shall bring;
1839,OM.(8),No rain for many a year shall fall
1840,OM.(8),And grievous drought shall ruin all.
1841,OM.(8),The troubled king with many a prayer
1842,OM.(8),Shall bid the priests some cure declare:
1843,OM.(8),"""The lore of Heaven 'tis yours to know,"
1844,OM.(8),Nor are ye blind to things below:
1845,OM.(8),"Declare, O holy men, the way"
1846,OM.(8),"This plague to expiate and stay."""
1847,OM.(8),Those best of Bráhmans shall reply:
1848,OM.(8),"""By every art, O Monarch, try"
1849,OM.(8),"Hither to bring Vibhándak's child,"
1850,OM.(8),"Persuaded, captured, or beguiled."
1851,OM.(8),And when the boy is hither led
1852,OM.(8),"To him thy daughter duly wed."""
1853,OM.(8),
1854,OM.(8),But how to bring that wondrous boy
1855,OM.(8),"His troubled thoughts will long employ,"
1856,OM.(8),And hopeless to achieve the task
1857,OM.(8),"He counsel of his lords will ask,"
1858,OM.(8),And bid his priests and servants bring
1859,OM.(8),With honour saintly Rishyasring.
1860,OM.(8),"But when they hear the monarch's speech,"
1861,OM.(8),"All these their master will beseech,"
1862,OM.(8),"With trembling hearts and looks of woe,"
1863,OM.(8),"To spare them, for they fear to go."
1864,OM.(8),And many a plan will they declare
1865,OM.(8),"And crafty plots will frame,"
1866,OM.(8),"And promise fair to show him there,"
1867,OM.(8),"Unforced, with none to blame."
1868,OM.(8),"On every word his lords shall say,"
1869,OM.(8),"The king will meditate,"
1870,OM.(8),And on the third returning day
1871,OM.(8),Recall them to debate.
1872,OM.(8),"Then this shall be the plan agreed,"
1873,OM.(8),That damsels shall be sent
1874,OM.(8),"Attired in holy hermits' weed,"
1875,OM.(8),"And skilled in blandishment,"
1876,OM.(8),That they the hermit may beguile
1877,OM.(8),With every art and amorous wile
1878,OM.(8),"Whose use they know so well,"
1879,OM.(8),And by their witcheries seduce
1880,OM.(8),The unsuspecting young recluse
1881,OM.(8),To leave his father's cell.
1882,OM.(8),Then when the boy with willing feet
1883,OM.(8),Shall wander from his calm retreat
1884,OM.(8),"And in that city stand,"
1885,OM.(8),"The troubles of the king shall end,"
1886,OM.(8),And streams of blessed rain descend
1887,OM.(8),Upon the thirsty land.
1888,OM.(8),Thus shall the holy Rishyasring
1889,OM.(8),"To Lomapád, the mighty king,"
1890,OM.(8),By wedlock be allied;
1891,OM.(8),"For Sántá, fairest of the fair,"
1892,OM.(8),"In mind and grace beyond compare,"
1893,OM.(8),Shall be his royal bride.
1894,OM.(8),"He, at the Offering of the Steed,"
1895,OM.(8),"The flames with holy oil shall feed,"
1896,OM.(8),And for King Dasaratha gain
1897,OM.(8),"Sons whom his prayers have begged in vain."""
1898,OM.(8),"""I have repeated, Sire, thus far,"
1899,OM.(8),"The words of old Sanatkumár,"
1900,OM.(8),In order as he spoke them then
1901,OM.(8),"Amid the crowd of holy men."""
1902,OM.(8),"Then Dasaratha cried with joy,"
1903,OM.(8),"""Say how they brought the hermit boy."""

1911,OM.(8),"The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,"
1912,OM.(8),Unfolded at the king's behest
1913,OM.(8),The plan the lords in council laid
1914,OM.(8),To draw the hermit from the shade:
1915,OM.(8),"""The priest, amid the lordly crowd,"
1916,OM.(8),To Lomapád thus spoke aloud:
1917,OM.(8),"""Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,"
1918,OM.(8),A harmless trick by all unblamed.
1919,OM.(8),Far from the world that hermit's child
1920,OM.(8),Lives lonely in the distant wild:
1921,OM.(8),"A stranger to the joys of sense,"
1922,OM.(8),His bliss is pain and abstinence;
1923,OM.(8),And all unknown are women yet
1924,OM.(8),"To him, a holy anchoret."
1925,OM.(8),The gentle passions we will wake
1926,OM.(8),That with resistless influence shake
1927,OM.(8),The hearts of men; and he
1928,OM.(8),Drawn by enchantment strong and sweet
1929,OM.(8),"Shall follow from his lone retreat,"
1930,OM.(8),And come and visit thee.
1931,OM.(8),Let ships be formed with utmost care
1932,OM.(8),"That artificial trees may bear,"
1933,OM.(8),And sweet fruit deftly made;
1934,OM.(8),"Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,"
1935,OM.(8),"And flowers, and many a bird be there"
1936,OM.(8),Beneath the leafy shade.
1937,OM.(8),Upon the ships thus decked a band
1938,OM.(8),"Of young and lovely girls shall stand,"
1939,OM.(8),"Rich in each charm that wakes desire,"
1940,OM.(8),And eyes that burn with amorous fire;
1941,OM.(8),"Well skilled to sing, and play, and dance"
1942,OM.(8),And ply their trade with smile and glance
1943,OM.(8),"Let these, attired in hermits' dress,"
1944,OM.(8),"Betake them to the wilderness,"
1945,OM.(8),And bring the boy of life austere
1946,OM.(8),"A voluntary captive here."""
1947,OM.(8),"He ended; and the king agreed,"
1948,OM.(8),By the priest's counsel won.
1949,OM.(8),And all the ministers took heed
1950,OM.(8),To see his bidding done.
1951,OM.(8),In ships with wondrous art prepared
1952,OM.(8),"Away the lovely women fared,"
1953,OM.(8),And soon beneath the shade they stood
1954,OM.(8),"Of the wild, lonely, dreary wood."
1955,OM.(8),And there the leafy cot they found
1956,OM.(8),"Where dwelt the devotee,"
1957,OM.(8),And looked with eager eyes around
1958,OM.(8),The hermit's son to see.
1959,OM.(8),"Still, of Vibhándak sore afraid,"
1960,OM.(8),They hid behind the creepers' shade.
1961,OM.(8),But when by careful watch they knew
1962,OM.(8),"The elder saint was far from view,"
1963,OM.(8),With bolder steps they ventured nigh
1964,OM.(8),To catch the youthful hermit's eye.
1965,OM.(8),"Then all the damsels, blithe and gay,"
1966,OM.(8),At various games began to play.
1967,OM.(8),They tossed the flying ball about
1968,OM.(8),"With dance and song and merry shout,"
1969,OM.(8),"And moved, their scented tresses bound"
1970,OM.(8),"With wreaths, in mazy motion round."
1971,OM.(8),"Some girls as if by love possessed,"
1972,OM.(8),"Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,"
1973,OM.(8),Up starting quickly to pursue
1974,OM.(8),Their intermitted game anew.
1975,OM.(8),It was a lovely sight to see
1976,OM.(8),"Those fair ones, as they played,"
1977,OM.(8),"While fragrant robes were floating free,"
1978,OM.(8),And bracelets clashing in their glee
1979,OM.(8),A pleasant tinkling made.
1980,OM.(8),"The anklet's chime, the Koďl's(82) cry"
1981,OM.(8),With music filled the place
1982,OM.(8),As 'twere some city in the sky
1983,OM.(8),Which heavenly minstrels grace.
1984,OM.(8),With each voluptuous art they strove
1985,OM.(8),"To win the tenant of the grove,"
1986,OM.(8),And with their graceful forms inspire
1987,OM.(8),His modest soul with soft desire.
1988,OM.(8),"With arch of brow, with beck and smile,"
1989,OM.(8),With every passion-waking wile
1990,OM.(8),"Of glance and lotus hand,"
1991,OM.(8),With all enticements that excite
1992,OM.(8),The longing for unknown delight
1993,OM.(8),Which boys in vain withstand.
1994,OM.(8),Forth came the hermit's son to view
1995,OM.(8),"The wondrous sight to him so new,"
1996,OM.(8),"And gazed in rapt surprise,"
1997,OM.(8),For from his natal hour till then
1998,OM.(8),On woman or the sons of men
1999,OM.(8),He ne'er had cast his eyes.
2000,OM.(8),"He saw them with their waists so slim,"
2001,OM.(8),"With fairest shape and faultless limb,"
2002,OM.(8),"In variegated robes arrayed,"
2003,OM.(8),And sweetly singing as they played.
2004,OM.(8),"Near and more near the hermit drew,"
2005,OM.(8),"And watched them at their game,"
2006,OM.(8),And stronger still the impulse grew
2007,OM.(8),To question whence they came.
2008,OM.(8),They marked the young ascetic gaze
2009,OM.(8),"With curious eye and wild amaze,"
2010,OM.(8),"And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,"
2011,OM.(8),And shrill their merry laughter rang.
2012,OM.(8),"Then came they nearer to his side,"
2013,OM.(8),And languishing with passion cried:
2014,OM.(8),"""Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,"
2015,OM.(8),Come suddenly to join us now?
2016,OM.(8),And why dost thou all lonely dwell
2017,OM.(8),"In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,"
2018,OM.(8),"We wish to know thee, gentle youth;"
2019,OM.(8),"Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth."""
2020,OM.(8),He gazed upon that sight he ne'er
2021,OM.(8),"Had seen before, of girls so fair,"
2022,OM.(8),And out of love a longing rose
2023,OM.(8),His sire and lineage to disclose:
2024,OM.(8),"""My father,"" thus he made reply,"
2025,OM.(8),"""Is Kasyap's son, a saint most high,"
2026,OM.(8),"Vibhándak styled; from him I came,"
2027,OM.(8),And Rishyasring he calls my name.
2028,OM.(8),Our hermit cot is near this place:
2029,OM.(8),"Come thither, O ye fair of face;"
2030,OM.(8),"There be it mine, with honour due,"
2031,OM.(8),"Ye gentle youths, to welcome you."""
2032,OM.(8),"They heard his speech, and gave consent,"
2033,OM.(8),And gladly to his cottage went.
2034,OM.(8),Vibhándak's son received them well
2035,OM.(8),Beneath the shelter of his cell
2036,OM.(8),"With guest-gift, water for their feet,"
2037,OM.(8),"And woodland fruit and roots to eat,"
2038,OM.(8),"They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,"
2039,OM.(8),Delighted with his courtesies:
2040,OM.(8),"""We too have goodly fruit in store,"
2041,OM.(8),Grown on the trees that shade our door;
2042,OM.(8),"Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste"
2043,OM.(8),The produce of our grove to taste;
2044,OM.(8),"And let, O good Ascetic, first"
2045,OM.(8),"This holy water quench thy thirst."""
2046,OM.(8),"They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet"
2047,OM.(8),Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;
2048,OM.(8),And many a dainty cate beside
2049,OM.(8),And luscious mead their stores supplied.
2050,OM.(8),"The seeming fruits, in taste and look,"
2051,OM.(8),"The unsuspecting hermit took,"
2052,OM.(8),"For, strange to him, their form beguiled"
2053,OM.(8),The dweller in the lonely wild.
2054,OM.(8),"Then round his neck fair arms were flung,"
2055,OM.(8),"And there the laughing damsels clung,"
2056,OM.(8),And pressing nearer and more near
2057,OM.(8),With sweet lips whispered at his ear;
2058,OM.(8),While rounded limb and swelling breast
2059,OM.(8),The youthful hermit softly pressed.
2060,OM.(8),"The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,"
2061,OM.(8),"The touch of a tender limb,"
2062,OM.(8),Over his yielding spirit stole
2063,OM.(8),And sweetly vanquished him.
2064,OM.(8),"But vows, they said, must now be paid;"
2065,OM.(8),"They bade the boy farewell,"
2066,OM.(8),"And, of the aged saint afraid,"
2067,OM.(8),Prepared to leave the dell.
2068,OM.(8),With ready guile they told him where
2069,OM.(8),Their hermit dwelling lay:
2070,OM.(8),"Then, lest the sire should find them there,"
2071,OM.(8),Sped by wild paths away.
2072,OM.(8),They fled and left him there alone
2073,OM.(8),By longing love possessed;
2074,OM.(8),And with a heart no more his own
2075,OM.(8),He roamed about distressed.
2076,OM.(8),"The aged saint came home, to find"
2077,OM.(8),"The hermit boy distraught,"
2078,OM.(8),Revolving in his troubled mind
2079,OM.(8),One solitary thought.
2080,OM.(8),"""Why dost thou not, my son,"" he cried,"
2081,OM.(8),"""Thy due obeisance pay?"
2082,OM.(8),Why do I see thee in the tide
2083,OM.(8),Of whelming thought to-day?
2084,OM.(8),A devotee should never wear
2085,OM.(8),A mien so sad and strange.
2086,OM.(8),"Come, quickly, dearest child, declare"
2087,OM.(8),"The reason of the change."""
2088,OM.(8),"And Rishyasring, when questioned thus,"
2089,OM.(8),Made answer in this wise:
2090,OM.(8),"""O sire, there came to visit us"
2091,OM.(8),Some men with lovely eyes.
2092,OM.(8),About my neck soft arms they wound
2093,OM.(8),And kept me tightly held
2094,OM.(8),"To tender breasts so soft and round,"
2095,OM.(8),That strangely heaved and swelled.
2096,OM.(8),They sing more sweetly as they dance
2097,OM.(8),"Than e'er I heard till now,"
2098,OM.(8),And play with many a sidelong glance
2099,OM.(8),"And arching of the brow."""
2100,OM.(8),"""My son,"" said he, ""thus giants roam"
2101,OM.(8),"Where holy hermits are,"
2102,OM.(8),And wander round their peaceful home
2103,OM.(8),Their rites austere to mar.
2104,OM.(8),"I charge thee, thou must never lay"
2105,OM.(8),"Thy trust in them, dear boy:"
2106,OM.(8),"They seek thee only to betray,"
2107,OM.(8),"And woo but to destroy."""
2108,OM.(8),Thus having warned him of his foes
2109,OM.(8),That night at home he spent.
2110,OM.(8),And when the morrow's sun arose
2111,OM.(8),Forth to the forest went.
2112,OM.(8),But Rishyasring with eager pace
2113,OM.(8),Sped forth and hurried to the place
2114,OM.(8),Where he those visitants had seen
2115,OM.(8),Of daintly waist and charming mien.
2116,OM.(8),When from afar they saw the son
2117,OM.(8),"Of Saint Vibhándak toward them run,"
2118,OM.(8),"To meet the hermit boy they hied,"

2536,OM.(8),Vasishtha's speech without delay
2537,OM.(8),Sumantra bent him to obey.
2538,OM.(8),And sent his trusty envoys forth
2539,OM.(8),"Eastward and westward, south and north."
2540,OM.(8),Obedient to the saint's request
2541,OM.(8),"Himself he hurried forth, and pressed"
2542,OM.(8),Each nobler chief and lord and king
2543,OM.(8),To hasten to the gathering.
2544,OM.(8),Before the saint Vasishtha stood
2545,OM.(8),"All those who wrought with stone and wood,"
2546,OM.(8),And showed the work which every one
2547,OM.(8),"In furtherance of the rite had done,"
2548,OM.(8),"Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,"
2549,OM.(8),Thus to the craftsmen all said he:
2550,OM.(8),"""I charge ye, masters, see to this,"
2551,OM.(8),"That there be nothing done amiss,"
2552,OM.(8),"And this, I pray, in mind be borne,"
2553,OM.(8),That not one gift ye give in scorn:
2554,OM.(8),Whenever scorn a gift attends
2555,OM.(8),"Great sin is his who thus offends."""
2556,OM.(8),"And now some days and nights had past,"
2557,OM.(8),"And kings began to gather fast,"
2558,OM.(8),And precious gems in liberal store
2559,OM.(8),As gifts to Dasaratha bore.
2560,OM.(8),Then joy thrilled through Vasishtha's breast
2561,OM.(8),As thus the monarch he addressed:
2562,OM.(8),"""Obedient to thy high decree"
2563,OM.(8),"The kings, my lord, are come to thee."
2564,OM.(8),And it has been my care to greet
2565,OM.(8),And honour all with reverence meet.
2566,OM.(8),"Thy servants' task is ended quite,"
2567,OM.(8),And all is ready for the rite.
2568,OM.(8),Come forth then to the sacred ground
2569,OM.(8),"Where all in order will be found."""
2570,OM.(8),Then Rishyasring confirmed the tale:
2571,OM.(8),Nor did their words to move him fail.
2572,OM.(8),The stars propitious influence lent
2573,OM.(8),When forth the world's great ruler went.
2574,OM.(8),Then by the sage Vasishtha led
2575,OM.(8),The priest begun to speed
2576,OM.(8),Those glorious rites wherein is shed
2577,OM.(8),The lifeblood of the steed.
2578,OM.(8),
2579,OM.(8),
2580,OM.(8),
2581,OM.(8),
2582,OM.(8),Canto XIII. The Sacrifice Finished.
2583,OM.(8),
2584,OM.(8),
2585,OM.(8),"The circling year had filled its course,"
2586,OM.(8),And back was brought the wandering horse:
2587,OM.(8),Then upon Sarjú's northern strand
2588,OM.(8),Began the rite the king had planned.
2589,OM.(8),"With Rishyasring the forms to guide,"
2590,OM.(8),"The Bráhmans to their task applied,"
2591,OM.(8),At that great offering of the steed
2592,OM.(8),Their lofty-minded king decreed.
2593,OM.(8),"The priests, who all the Scripture knew,"
2594,OM.(8),"Performed their part in order due,"
2595,OM.(8),And circled round in solemn train
2596,OM.(8),As precepts of the law ordain.
2597,OM.(8),Pravargya rites(92) were duly sped:
2598,OM.(8),For Upasads(93) the flames were fed.
2599,OM.(8),"Then from the plant(94) the juice was squeezed,"
2600,OM.(8),And those high saints with minds well pleased
2601,OM.(8),Performed the mystic rites begun
2602,OM.(8),With bathing ere the rise of sun
2603,OM.(8),"They gave the portion Indra's claim,"
2604,OM.(8),And hymned the King whom none can blame.
2605,OM.(8),"The mid-day bathing followed next,"
2606,OM.(8),Observed as bids the holy text.
2607,OM.(8),"Then the good priests with utmost care,"
2608,OM.(8),"In form that Scripture's rules declare,"
2609,OM.(8),For the third time pure water shed
2610,OM.(8),On high souled Dasaratha's head.
2611,OM.(8),Then Rishyasring and all the rest
2612,OM.(8),To Indra and the Gods addressed
2613,OM.(8),"Their sweet-toned hymn of praise and prayer,"
2614,OM.(8),And called them in the rite to share.
2615,OM.(8),With sweetest song and hymn entoned
2616,OM.(8),"They gave the Gods in heaven enthroned,"
2617,OM.(8),"As duty bids, the gifts they claim,"
2618,OM.(8),The holy oil that feeds the flame.
2619,OM.(8),"And many an offering there was paid,"
2620,OM.(8),And not one slip in all was made.
2621,OM.(8),For with most careful heed they saw
2622,OM.(8),That all was done by Veda law.
2623,OM.(8),"None, all those days, was seen oppressed"
2624,OM.(8),By hunger or by toil distressed.
2625,OM.(8),Why speak of human kind? No beast
2626,OM.(8),Was there that lacked an ample feast.
2627,OM.(8),"For there was store for all who came,"
2628,OM.(8),For orphan child and lonely dame;
2629,OM.(8),"The old and young were well supplied,"
2630,OM.(8),The poor and hungry satisfied.
2631,OM.(8),"Throughout the day ascetics fed,"
2632,OM.(8),And those who roam to beg their bread:
2633,OM.(8),"While all around the cry was still,"
2634,OM.(8),"""Give forth, give forth,"" and ""Eat your fill."""
2635,OM.(8),"""Give forth with liberal hand the meal,"
2636,OM.(8),"And various robes in largess deal."""
2637,OM.(8),Urged by these cries on every side
2638,OM.(8),Unweariedly their task they plied:
2639,OM.(8),And heaps of food like hills in size
2640,OM.(8),In boundless plenty met the eyes:
2641,OM.(8),"And lakes of sauce, each day renewed,"
2642,OM.(8),Refreshed the weary multitude.
2643,OM.(8),"And strangers there from distant lands,"
2644,OM.(8),And women folk in crowded bands
2645,OM.(8),The best of food and drink obtained
2646,OM.(8),At the great rite the king ordained.
2647,OM.(8),"Apart from all, the Bráhmans there,"
2648,OM.(8),"Thousands on thousands, took their share"
2649,OM.(8),"Of various dainties sweet to taste,"
2650,OM.(8),"On plates of gold and silver placed,"
2651,OM.(8),"All ready set, as, when they willed,"
2652,OM.(8),The twice-born men their places filled.
2653,OM.(8),And servants in fair garments dressed
2654,OM.(8),Waited upon each Bráhman guest.
2655,OM.(8),"Of cheerful mind and mien were they,"
2656,OM.(8),With gold and jewelled earrings gay.
2657,OM.(8),The best of Bráhmans praised the fare
2658,OM.(8),"Of countless sorts, of flavour rare:"
2659,OM.(8),And thus to Raghu's son they cried:
2660,OM.(8),"""We bless thee, and are satisfied."""
2661,OM.(8),Between the rites some Bráhmans spent
2662,OM.(8),"The time in learned argument,"
2663,OM.(8),"With ready flow of speech, sedate,"
2664,OM.(8),And keen to vanquish in debate.(95)
2665,OM.(8),There day by day the holy train
2666,OM.(8),Performed all rites as rules ordain.
2667,OM.(8),No priest in all that host was found
2668,OM.(8),But kept the vows that held him bound:
2669,OM.(8),"None, but the holy Vedas knew,"
2670,OM.(8),And all their six-fold science(96) too.
2671,OM.(8),No Bráhman there was found unfit
2672,OM.(8),To speak with eloquence and wit.
2673,OM.(8),And now the appointed time came near
2674,OM.(8),The sacrificial posts to rear.
2675,OM.(8),"They brought them, and prepared to fix"
2676,OM.(8),Of Bel(97) and Khádir(98) six and six;
2677,OM.(8),"Six, made of the Palása(99) tree,"
2678,OM.(8),"Of Fig-wood one, apart to be:"
2679,OM.(8),Of Sleshmát(100) and of Devadár(101)
2680,OM.(8),"One column each, the mightiest far:"
2681,OM.(8),"So thick the two, the arms of man"
2682,OM.(8),Their ample girth would fail to span.
2683,OM.(8),All these with utmost care were wrought
2684,OM.(8),"By hand of priests in Scripture taught,"
2685,OM.(8),And all with gold were gilded bright
2686,OM.(8),To add new splendour to the rite:
2687,OM.(8),"Twenty-and-one those stakes in all,"
2688,OM.(8),Each one-and-twenty cubits tall:
2689,OM.(8),And one-and-twenty ribbons there
2690,OM.(8),"Hung on the pillars, bright and fair."
2691,OM.(8),"Firm in the earth they stood at last,"
2692,OM.(8),Where cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;
2693,OM.(8),"And there unshaken each remained,"
2694,OM.(8),Octagonal and smoothly planed.
2695,OM.(8),"Then ribbons over all were hung,"
2696,OM.(8),And flowers and scent around them flung.
2697,OM.(8),Thus decked they cast a glory forth
2698,OM.(8),Like the great saints who star the north.(102)
2699,OM.(8),The sacrificial altar then
2700,OM.(8),"Was raised by skilful twice-born men,"
2701,OM.(8),In shape and figure to behold
2702,OM.(8),"An eagle with his wings of gold,"
2703,OM.(8),With twice nine pits and formed three-fold
2704,OM.(8),"Each for some special God, beside"
2705,OM.(8),The pillars were the victims tied;
2706,OM.(8),"The birds that roam the wood, the air,"
2707,OM.(8),"The water, and the land were there,"
2708,OM.(8),"And snakes and things of reptile birth,"
2709,OM.(8),And healing herbs that spring from earth:
2710,OM.(8),"As texts prescribe, in Scripture found,"
2711,OM.(8),Three hundred victims there were bound.
2712,OM.(8),The steed devoted to the host
2713,OM.(8),"Of Gods, the gem they honour most,"
2714,OM.(8),Was duly sprinkled. Then the Queen
2715,OM.(8),"Kausalyá, with delighted mien,"
2716,OM.(8),"With reverent steps around him paced,"
2717,OM.(8),And with sweet wreaths the victim graced;
2718,OM.(8),Then with three swords in order due
2719,OM.(8),"She smote the steed with joy, and slew."
2720,OM.(8),"That night the queen, a son to gain,"
2721,OM.(8),With calm and steady heart was fain
2722,OM.(8),By the dead charger's side to stay
2723,OM.(8),From evening till the break of day.
2724,OM.(8),"Then came three priests, their care to lead"
2725,OM.(8),"The other queens to touch the steed,"
2726,OM.(8),"Upon Kausalyá to attend,"
2727,OM.(8),Their company and aid to lend.
2728,OM.(8),"As by the horse she still reclined,"
2729,OM.(8),"With happy mien and cheerful mind,"
2730,OM.(8),With Rishyasring the twice-born came
2731,OM.(8),And praised and blessed the royal dame.
2732,OM.(8),"The priest who well his duty knew,"
2733,OM.(8),"And every sense could well subdue,"
2734,OM.(8),From out the bony chambers freed
2735,OM.(8),And boiled the marrow of the steed.
2736,OM.(8),"Above the steam the monarch bent,"
2737,OM.(8),"And, as he smelt the fragrant scent,"
2738,OM.(8),In time and order drove afar
2739,OM.(8),All error that his hopes could mar.
2740,OM.(8),Then sixteen priests together came
2741,OM.(8),And cast into the sacred flame
2742,OM.(8),"The severed members of the horse,"
2743,OM.(8),Made ready all in ordered course.
2744,OM.(8),On piles of holy Fig-tree raised
2745,OM.(8),The meaner victims' bodies blazed:
2746,OM.(8),"The steed, of all the creatures slain,"
2747,OM.(8),Alone required a pile of cane.
2748,OM.(8),"Three days, as is by law decreed,"
2749,OM.(8),Lasted that Offering of the Steed.
2750,OM.(8),"The Chatushtom began the rite,"
2751,OM.(8),"And when the sun renewed his light,"
2752,OM.(8),The Ukthya followed: after came
2753,OM.(8),The Atirátra's holy flame.
2754,OM.(8),"These were the rites, and many more"
2755,OM.(8),"Arranged by light of holy lore,"
2756,OM.(8),"The Aptoryám of mighty power,"
2757,OM.(8),"And, each performed in proper hour,"
2758,OM.(8),The Abhijit and Visvajit
2759,OM.(8),With every form and service fit;
2760,OM.(8),And with the sacrifice at night
2761,OM.(8),The Jyotishtom and Áyus rite.(103)
2762,OM.(8),"The task was done, as laws prescribe:"
2763,OM.(8),"The monarch, glory of his tribe,"
2764,OM.(8),Bestowed the land in liberal grants
2765,OM.(8),Upon the sacred ministrants.
2766,OM.(8),"He gave the region of the east,"
2767,OM.(8),"His conquest, to the Hotri priest."
2768,OM.(8),"The west, the celebrant obtained:"
2769,OM.(8),"The south, the priest presiding gained:"
2770,OM.(8),The northern region was the share
2771,OM.(8),"Of him who chanted forth the prayer,(104)"
2772,OM.(8),Thus did each priest obtain his meed
2773,OM.(8),"At the great Slaughter of the Steed,"
2774,OM.(8),"Ordained, the best of all to be,"
2775,OM.(8),By self-existent deity.
2776,OM.(8),Ikshváku's son with joyful mind
2777,OM.(8),"This noble fee to each assigned,"
2778,OM.(8),But all the priests with one accord
2779,OM.(8),Addressed that unpolluted lord:
2780,OM.(8),"""Tis thine alone to keep the whole"
2781,OM.(8),Of this broad earth in firm control.
2782,OM.(8),No gift of lands from thee we seek:
2783,OM.(8),To guard these realms our hands were weak.
2784,OM.(8),On sacred lore our days are spent:
2785,OM.(8),"Let other gifts our wants content."""
2786,OM.(8),
2787,OM.(8),The chief of old Ikshváku's line
2788,OM.(8),"Gave them ten hundred thousand kine,"
2789,OM.(8),"A hundred millions of fine gold,"
2790,OM.(8),The same in silver four times told.
2791,OM.(8),But every priest in presence there
2792,OM.(8),With one accord resigned his share.
2793,OM.(8),"To Saint Vasishtha, high of soul,"
2794,OM.(8),And Rishyasring they gave the whole.
2795,OM.(8),"That largess pleased those Bráhmans well,"
2796,OM.(8),Who bade the prince his wishes tell.
2797,OM.(8),"Then Dasaratha, mighty king,"
2798,OM.(8),Made answer thus to Rishyasring:
2799,OM.(8),"""O holy Hermit, of thy grace,"
2800,OM.(8),"Vouchsafe the increase of my race."""
2801,OM.(8),He spoke; nor was his prayer denied:
2802,OM.(8),The best of Bráhmans thus replied:
2803,OM.(8),"""Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,"
2804,OM.(8),"Upholders of thy royal line."""
2805,OM.(8),
2806,OM.(8),
2807,OM.(8),
2808,OM.(8),
2809,OM.(8),Canto XIV. Rávan Doomed.
2810,OM.(8),
2811,OM.(8),
2812,OM.(8),"The saint, well read in holy lore,"
2813,OM.(8),"Pondered awhile his answer o'er,"
2814,OM.(8),"And thus again addressed the king,"
2815,OM.(8),His wandering thoughts regathering:
2816,OM.(8),"""Another rite will I begin"
2817,OM.(8),"Which shall the sons thou cravest win,"
2818,OM.(8),Where all things shall be duly sped
2819,OM.(8),"And first Atharva texts be read."""
2820,OM.(8),
2821,OM.(8),Then by Vibhándak's gentle son
2822,OM.(8),"Was that high sacrifice begun,"
2823,OM.(8),The king's advantage seeking still
2824,OM.(8),And zealous to perform his will.
2825,OM.(8),"Now all the Gods had gathered there,"
2826,OM.(8),Each one for his allotted share:
2827,OM.(8),"Brahmá, the ruler of the sky,"
2828,OM.(8),"Sthánu, Náráyan, Lord most high,"
2829,OM.(8),And holy Indra men might view
2830,OM.(8),With Maruts(105) for his retinue;
2831,OM.(8),"The heavenly chorister, and saint,"
2832,OM.(8),"And spirit pure from earthly taint,"
2833,OM.(8),With one accord had sought the place
2834,OM.(8),The high-souled monarch's rite to grace.
2835,OM.(8),Then to the Gods who came to take
2836,OM.(8),Their proper share the hermit spake:
2837,OM.(8),"""For you has Dasaratha slain"
2838,OM.(8),"The votive steed, a son to gain;"
2839,OM.(8),"Stern penance-rites the king has tried,"
2840,OM.(8),"And in firm faith on you relied,"
2841,OM.(8),And now with undiminished care
2842,OM.(8),A second rite would fain prepare.
2843,OM.(8),"But, O ye Gods, consent to grant"
2844,OM.(8),The longing of your supplicant.
2845,OM.(8),"For him beseeching hands I lift,"
2846,OM.(8),"And pray you all to grant the gift,"
2847,OM.(8),That four fair sons of high renown
2848,OM.(8),"The offerings of the king may crown."""
2849,OM.(8),They to the hermit's son replied:
2850,OM.(8),"""His longing shall be gratified."
2851,OM.(8),"For, Bráhman, in most high degree"
2852,OM.(8),"We love the king and honour thee."""
2853,OM.(8),
2854,OM.(8),"These words the Gods in answer said,"
2855,OM.(8),And vanished thence by Indra led.
2856,OM.(8),"Thus to the Lord, the worlds who made,"
2857,OM.(8),The Immortals all assembled prayed:
2858,OM.(8),"""O Brahmá, mighty by thy grace,"
2859,OM.(8),"Rávan, who rules the giant race,"
2860,OM.(8),"Torments us in his senseless pride,"
2861,OM.(8),And penance-loving saints beside.
2862,OM.(8),For thou well pleased in days of old
2863,OM.(8),"Gavest the boon that makes him bold,"
2864,OM.(8),That God nor demon e'er should kill
2865,OM.(8),"His charmed life, for so thy will."
2866,OM.(8),"We, honouring that high behest,"
2867,OM.(8),Bear all his rage though sore distressed.
2868,OM.(8),That lord of giants fierce and fell
2869,OM.(8),Scourges the earth and heaven and hell.
2870,OM.(8),"Mad with thy boon, his impious rage"
2871,OM.(8),Smites saint and bard and God and sage.
2872,OM.(8),"The sun himself withholds his glow,"
2873,OM.(8),The wind in fear forbears to blow;
2874,OM.(8),The fire restrains his wonted heat
2875,OM.(8),"Where stand the dreaded Rávan's feet,"
2876,OM.(8),"And, necklaced with the wandering wave,"
2877,OM.(8),The sea before him fears to rave.
2878,OM.(8),Kuvera's self in sad defeat
2879,OM.(8),Is driven from his blissful seat.
2880,OM.(8),"We see, we feel the giant's might,"
2881,OM.(8),And woe comes o'er us and affright.
2882,OM.(8),"To thee, O Lord, thy suppliants pray"
2883,OM.(8),"To find some cure this plague to stay."""
2884,OM.(8),
2885,OM.(8),Thus by the gathered Gods addressed
2886,OM.(8),"He pondered in his secret breast,"
2887,OM.(8),"And said: ""One only way I find"
2888,OM.(8),To slay this fiend of evil mind.
2889,OM.(8),He prayed me once his life to guard
2890,OM.(8),"From demon, God, and heavenly bard,"
2891,OM.(8),"And spirits of the earth and air,"
2892,OM.(8),And I consenting heard his prayer.
2893,OM.(8),But the proud giant in his scorn
2894,OM.(8),Recked not of man of woman born.
2895,OM.(8),"None else may take his life away,"
2896,OM.(8),"But only man the fiend may slay."""
2897,OM.(8),"The Gods, with Indra at their head,"
2898,OM.(8),Rejoiced to hear the words he said.
2899,OM.(8),"Then crowned with glory like a flame,"
2900,OM.(8),Lord Vishnu to the council came;
2901,OM.(8),"His hands shell, mace, and discus bore,"
2902,OM.(8),And saffron were the robes he wore.
2903,OM.(8),"Riding his eagle through the crowd,"
2904,OM.(8),"As the sun rides upon a cloud,"
2905,OM.(8),"With bracelets of fine gold, he came"
2906,OM.(8),Loud welcomed by the Gods' acclaim.
2907,OM.(8),"His praise they sang with one consent,"
2908,OM.(8),"And cried, in lowly reverence bent:"
2909,OM.(8),"""O Lord whose hand fierce Madhu(106) slew,"
2910,OM.(8),"Be thou our refuge, firm and true;"
2911,OM.(8),"Friend of the suffering worlds art thou,"
2912,OM.(8),"We pray thee help thy suppliants now."""
2913,OM.(8),"Then Vishnu spake: ""Ye Gods, declare,"
2914,OM.(8),"What may I do to grant your prayer?"""
2915,OM.(8),
2916,OM.(8),"""King Dasaratha,"" thus cried they,"
2917,OM.(8),"""Fervent in penance many a day,"
2918,OM.(8),"The sacrificial steed has slain,"
2919,OM.(8),"Longing for sons, but all in vain."
2920,OM.(8),"Now, at the cry of us forlorn,"
2921,OM.(8),Incarnate as his seed be born.
2922,OM.(8),Three queens has he: each lovely dame
2923,OM.(8),"Like Beauty, Modesty, or Fame."
2924,OM.(8),"Divide thyself in four, and be"
2925,OM.(8),His offspring by these noble three.
2926,OM.(8),"Man's nature take, and slay in fight"
2927,OM.(8),Rávan who laughs at heavenly might:
2928,OM.(8),"This common scourge, this rankling thorn"
2929,OM.(8),Whom the three worlds too long have borne
2930,OM.(8),For Rávan in the senseless pride
2931,OM.(8),Of might unequalled has defied
2932,OM.(8),"The host of heaven, and plagues with woe"
2933,OM.(8),"Angel and bard and saint below,"
2934,OM.(8),Crushing each spirit and each maid
2935,OM.(8),Who plays in Nandan's(107) heavenly shade.
2936,OM.(8),"O conquering Lord, to thee we bow;"
2937,OM.(8),Our surest hope and trust art thou.
2938,OM.(8),"Regard the world of men below,"
2939,OM.(8),"And slay the Gods' tremendous foe."""

2941,OM.(8),"When thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,"
2942,OM.(8),His wise reply Náráyan(108) made:
2943,OM.(8),"""What task demands my presence there,"
2944,OM.(8),"And whence this dread, ye Gods declare."""
2945,OM.(8),
2946,OM.(8),"The Gods replied: ""We fear, O Lord,"
2947,OM.(8),"Fierce Rávan, ravener abhorred."
2948,OM.(8),"Be thine the glorious task, we pray,"
2949,OM.(8),In human form this fiend to slay.
2950,OM.(8),By thee of all the Blest alone
2951,OM.(8),This sinner may be overthrown.
2952,OM.(8),He gained by penance long and dire
2953,OM.(8),The favour of the mighty Sire.
2954,OM.(8),Then He who every gift bestows
2955,OM.(8),"Guarded the fiend from heavenly foes,"
2956,OM.(8),And gave a pledge his life that kept
2957,OM.(8),"From all things living, man except."
2958,OM.(8),On him thus armed no other foe
2959,OM.(8),Than man may deal the deadly blow.
2960,OM.(8),"Assume, O King, a mortal birth,"
2961,OM.(8),"And strike the demon to the earth."""
2962,OM.(8),
2963,OM.(8),"Then Vishnu, God of Gods, the Lord"
2964,OM.(8),"Supreme by all the worlds adored,"
2965,OM.(8),To Brahmá and the suppliants spake:
2966,OM.(8),"""Dismiss your fear: for your dear sake"
2967,OM.(8),"In battle will I smite him dead,"
2968,OM.(8),"The cruel fiend, the Immortal's dread."
2969,OM.(8),And lords and ministers and all
2970,OM.(8),His kith and kin with him shall fall.
2971,OM.(8),"Then, in the world of mortal men,"

2973,OM.(8),"I as a human king will reign,"
2974,OM.(8),"And guard the earth as my domain."""
2975,OM.(8),
2976,OM.(8),"God, saint, and nymph, and minstrel throng"
2977,OM.(8),With heavenly voices raised their song
2978,OM.(8),In hymns of triumph to the God
2979,OM.(8),Whose conquering feet on Madhu trod:
2980,OM.(8),"""Champion of Gods, as man appear,"
2981,OM.(8),"This cruel Rávan slay,"
2982,OM.(8),"The thorn that saints and hermits fear,"
2983,OM.(8),The plague that none can stay.
2984,OM.(8),In savage fury uncontrolled

2995,OM.(8),When wisest Vishnu thus had given
2996,OM.(8),"His promise to the Gods of heaven,"
2997,OM.(8),He pondered in his secret mind
2998,OM.(8),"A suited place of birth to find,"
2999,OM.(8),"Then he decreed, the lotus-eyed,"
3000,OM.(8),"In four his being to divide,"
3001,OM.(8),"And Dasaratha, gracious king,"
3002,OM.(8),He chose as sire from whom to spring.
3003,OM.(8),"That childless prince of high renown,"
3004,OM.(8),"Who smote in war his foemen down,"
3005,OM.(8),At that same time with utmost care
3006,OM.(8),Prepared the rite that wins an heir.(109)
3007,OM.(8),"Then Vishnu, fain on earth to dwell,"
3008,OM.(8),"Bade the Almighty Sire farewell,"
3009,OM.(8),And vanished while a reverent crowd
3010,OM.(8),Of Gods and saints in worship bowed.
3011,OM.(8),
3012,OM.(8),"The monarch watched the sacred rite,"
3013,OM.(8),"When a vast form of awful might,"
3014,OM.(8),"Of matchless splendour, strength, and size"
3015,OM.(8),Was manifest before his eyes.
3016,OM.(8),"From forth the sacrificial flame,"
3017,OM.(8),"Dark, robed in red, the being came."
3018,OM.(8),"His voice was drumlike, loud and low,"
3019,OM.(8),His face suffused with rosy glow.
3020,OM.(8),Like a huge lion's mane appeared
3021,OM.(8),The long locks of his hair and beard.
3022,OM.(8),"He shone with many a lucky sign,"
3023,OM.(8),And many an ornament divine;
3024,OM.(8),"A towering mountain in his height,"
3025,OM.(8),A tiger in his gait and might.
3026,OM.(8),"No precious mine more rich could be,"
3027,OM.(8),No burning flame more bright than he.
3028,OM.(8),"His arms embraced in loving hold,"
3029,OM.(8),"Like a dear wife, a vase of gold"
3030,OM.(8),Whose silver lining held a draught
3031,OM.(8),Of nectar as in heaven is quaffed:
3032,OM.(8),"A vase so vast, so bright to view,"
3033,OM.(8),They scarce could count the vision true.
3034,OM.(8),"Upon the king his eyes he bent,"
3035,OM.(8),"And said: ""The Lord of life has sent"
3036,OM.(8),"His servant down, O Prince, to be"
3037,OM.(8),"A messenger from heaven to thee."""
3038,OM.(8),The king with all his nobles by
3039,OM.(8),Raised reverent hands and made reply:
3040,OM.(8),"""Welcome, O glorious being! Say"
3041,OM.(8),"How can my care thy grace repay."""
3042,OM.(8),Envoy of Him whom all adore
3043,OM.(8),Thus to the king he spake once more:
3044,OM.(8),"""The Gods accept thy worship: they"
3045,OM.(8),Give thee the blessed fruit to-day.
3046,OM.(8),"Approach and take, O glorious King,"
3047,OM.(8),"This heavenly nectar which I bring,"
3048,OM.(8),"For it shall give thee sons and wealth,"
3049,OM.(8),And bless thee with a store of health.
3050,OM.(8),"Give it to those fair queens of thine,"

3052,OM.(8),And they the princely sons shall bear
3053,OM.(8),"Long sought by sacrifice and prayer."""
3054,OM.(8),
3055,OM.(8),"""Yea, O my lord,"" the monarch said,"
3056,OM.(8),"And took the vase upon his head,"
3057,OM.(8),"The gift of Gods, of fine gold wrought,"
3058,OM.(8),With store of heavenly liquor fraught.
3059,OM.(8),"He honoured, filled with transport new,"
3060,OM.(8),"That wondrous being, fair to view,"
3061,OM.(8),As round the envoy of the God
3062,OM.(8),With reverential steps he trod.(110)
3063,OM.(8),"His errand done, that form of light"
3064,OM.(8),Arose and vanished from the sight.
3065,OM.(8),"High rapture filled the monarch's soul,"
3066,OM.(8),"Possessed of that celestial bowl,"
3067,OM.(8),As when a man by want distressed
3068,OM.(8),With unexpected wealth is blest.
3069,OM.(8),And rays of transport seemed to fall
3070,OM.(8),"Illuminating bower and hall,"
3071,OM.(8),"As when the autumn moon rides high,"
3072,OM.(8),And floods with lovely light the sky.
3073,OM.(8),"Quick to the ladies' bower he sped,"
3074,OM.(8),And thus to Queen Kausalyá said:
3075,OM.(8),"""This genial nectar take and quaff,"""
3076,OM.(8),"He spoke, and gave the lady half."
3077,OM.(8),Part of the nectar that remained
3078,OM.(8),Sumitrá from his hand obtained.
3079,OM.(8),"He gave, to make her fruitful too,"
3080,OM.(8),Kaikeyí half the residue.
3081,OM.(8),"A portion yet remaining there,"
3082,OM.(8),He paused awhile to think.
3083,OM.(8),"Then gave Sumitrá, with her share."
3084,OM.(8),The remnant of the drink.
3085,OM.(8),Thus on each queen of those fair three
3086,OM.(8),"A part the king bestowed,"
3087,OM.(8),And with sweet hope a child to see
3088,OM.(8),Their yearning bosoms glowed.
3089,OM.(8),The heavenly bowl the king supplied
3090,OM.(8),"Their longing souls relieved,"
3091,OM.(8),"And soon, with rapture and with pride,"
3092,OM.(8),Each royal dame conceived.
3093,OM.(8),"He gazed upon each lady's face,"
3094,OM.(8),"And triumphed as he gazed,"

3147,OM.(8),Of Gandhamádan brave and bold
3148,OM.(8),The father was the Lord of Gold.
3149,OM.(8),"Nala the mighty, dear to fame,"
3150,OM.(8),Of skilful Visvakarmá(118) came.
3151,OM.(8),"From Agni,(119) Nila bright as flame,"

3174,OM.(8),"Some chiefs of Vánar mothers came,"
3175,OM.(8),"Some of she-bear and minstrel dame,"
3176,OM.(8),Skilled in all arms in battle's shock;
3177,OM.(8),"The brandished tree, the loosened rock;"
3178,OM.(8),"And prompt, should other weapons fail,"
3179,OM.(8),To fight and slay with tooth and nail.

3237,OM.(8),"And Dasaratha, ere they went,"
3238,OM.(8),Addressed them thus benevolent:
3239,OM.(8),"""Now may you, each with joyful heart,"
3240,OM.(8),"To your own realms, O Kings, depart."
3241,OM.(8),"Peace and good luck attend you there,"
3242,OM.(8),"And blessing, is my friendly prayer;"
3243,OM.(8),Let cares of state each mind engage
3244,OM.(8),To guard his royal heritage.
3245,OM.(8),A monarch from his throne expelled
3246,OM.(8),No better than the dead is held.
3247,OM.(8),So he who cares for power and might
3248,OM.(8),Must guard his realm and royal right.
3249,OM.(8),Such care a meed in heaven will bring
3250,OM.(8),Better than rites and offering.
3251,OM.(8),Such care a king his country owes
3252,OM.(8),"As man upon himself bestows,"
3253,OM.(8),When for his body he provides
3254,OM.(8),Raiment and every need besides.

3261,OM.(8),Went forth to all the realms around.
3262,OM.(8),"The rites were o'er, the guests were sped:"
3263,OM.(8),"The train the best of Bráhmans led,"
3264,OM.(8),"In which the king with joyful soul,"
3265,OM.(8),"With his dear wives, and with the whole"
3266,OM.(8),Of his imperial host and train
3267,OM.(8),"Of cars and servants turned again,"
3268,OM.(8),"And, as a monarch dear to fame,"
3269,OM.(8),Within his royal city came.
3270,OM.(8),
3271,OM.(8),"Next, Rishyasring, well-honoured sage,"
3272,OM.(8),"And Sántá, sought their hermitage."
3273,OM.(8),"The king himself, of prudent mind,"
3274,OM.(8),"Attended him, with troops behind."
3275,OM.(8),And all her men the town outpoured
3276,OM.(8),With Saint Vasishtha and their lord.
3277,OM.(8),"High mounted on a car of state,"
3278,OM.(8),O'er canopied fair Sántá sate.
3279,OM.(8),"Drawn by white oxen, while a band"
3280,OM.(8),Of servants marched on either hand.
3281,OM.(8),"Great gifts of countless price she bore,"
3282,OM.(8),With sheep and goats and gems in store.
3283,OM.(8),Like Beauty's self the lady shone
3284,OM.(8),"With all the jewels she had on,"
3285,OM.(8),"As, happy in her sweet content,"
3286,OM.(8),Peerless amid the fair she went.
3287,OM.(8),Not Queen Paulomí's(125) self could be
3288,OM.(8),More loving to her lord than she.
3289,OM.(8),"She who had lived in happy ease,"
3290,OM.(8),"Honoured with all her heart could please,"
3291,OM.(8),While dames and kinsfolk ever vied
3292,OM.(8),"To see her wishes gratified,"
3293,OM.(8),Soon as she knew her husband's will
3294,OM.(8),"Again to seek the forest, still"
3295,OM.(8),"Was ready for the hermit's cot,"
3296,OM.(8),Nor murmured at her altered lot.
3297,OM.(8),The king attended to the wild
3298,OM.(8),"That hermit and his own dear child,"
3299,OM.(8),And in the centre of a throng
3300,OM.(8),Of noble courtiers rode along.
3301,OM.(8),The sage's son had let prepare
3302,OM.(8),"A lodge within the wood, and there"
3303,OM.(8),While they lingered blithe and gay.
3304,OM.(8),"Then, duly honoured, went their way."
3305,OM.(8),The glorious hermit Rishyasring
3306,OM.(8),Drew near and thus besought the king:
3307,OM.(8),
3308,OM.(8),"""Return, my honoured lord, I pray,"
3309,OM.(8),"Return, upon thy homeward way."""
3310,OM.(8),"The monarch, with the waiting crowd,"
3311,OM.(8),"Lifted his voice and wept aloud,"
3312,OM.(8),And with eyes dripping still to each
3313,OM.(8),Of his good queens he spake this speech:
3314,OM.(8),
3315,OM.(8),"""Kausalyá and Sumitrá dear,"
3316,OM.(8),"And thou, my sweet Kaikeyí, hear."
3317,OM.(8),"All upon Sántá feast your gaze,"
3318,OM.(8),"The last time for a length of days."""
3319,OM.(8),"To Sántá's arms the ladies leapt,"
3320,OM.(8),"And hung about her neck and wept,"
3321,OM.(8),"And cried, ""O, happy be the life"
3322,OM.(8),Of this great Bráhman and his wife.
3323,OM.(8),"The Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high,"
3324,OM.(8),"The Earth, the Streams, the circling Sky,"
3325,OM.(8),"Preserve thee in the wood, true spouse,"
3326,OM.(8),Devoted to thy husband's vows.
3327,OM.(8),"And O dear Sántá, ne'er neglect"
3328,OM.(8),To pay the dues of meek respect
3329,OM.(8),"To the great saint, thy husband's sire,"
3330,OM.(8),With all observance and with fire.
3331,OM.(8),"And, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,"
3332,OM.(8),Forget not thou thy husband's claim;
3333,OM.(8),"In every change, in good and ill,"
3334,OM.(8),"Let thy sweet words delight him still,"
3335,OM.(8),And let thy worship constant be:
3336,OM.(8),Her lord is woman's deity.
3337,OM.(8),"To learn thy welfare, dearest friend,"
3338,OM.(8),The king will many a Bráhman send.
3339,OM.(8),"Let happy thoughts thy spirit cheer,"
3340,OM.(8),"And be not troubled, daughter dear."""
3341,OM.(8),
3342,OM.(8),These soothing words the ladies said.
3343,OM.(8),And pressed their lips upon her head.
3344,OM.(8),"Each gave with sighs her last adieu,"
3345,OM.(8),Then at the king's command withdrew.
3346,OM.(8),The king around the hermit went
3347,OM.(8),"With circling footsteps reverent,"
3348,OM.(8),And placed at Rishyasring's command
3349,OM.(8),Some soldiers of his royal band.
3350,OM.(8),"The Bráhman bowed in turn and cried,"
3351,OM.(8),"""May fortune never leave thy side."
3352,OM.(8),"O mighty King, with justice reign,"
3353,OM.(8),"And still thy people's love retain."""
3354,OM.(8),"He spoke, and turned away his face,"
3355,OM.(8),"And, as the hermit went,"
3356,OM.(8),"The monarch, rooted to the place,"
3357,OM.(8),Pursued with eyes intent.
3358,OM.(8),But when the sage had past from view
3359,OM.(8),"King Dasaratha turned him too,"
3360,OM.(8),Still fixing on his friend each thought.
3361,OM.(8),With such deep love his breast was fraught.
3362,OM.(8),Amid his people's loud acclaim
3363,OM.(8),"Home to his royal seat he came,"
3364,OM.(8),"And lived delighted there,"
3365,OM.(8),"Expecting when each queenly dame,"
3366,OM.(8),"Upholder of his ancient fame,"
3367,OM.(8),Her promised son should bear.
3368,OM.(8),The glorious sage his way pursued
3369,OM.(8),Till close before his eyes he viewed
3370,OM.(8),"Sweet Champá, Lomapád's fair town,"
3371,OM.(8),Wreathed with her Champacs'(126) leafy crown.
3372,OM.(8),"Soon as the saint's approach he knew,"
3373,OM.(8),"The king, to yield him honour due,"
3374,OM.(8),Went forth to meet him with a band
3375,OM.(8),Of priests and nobles of the land:
3376,OM.(8),"""Hail, Sage,"" he cried, ""O joy to me!"
3377,OM.(8),"What bliss it is, my lord, to see"
3378,OM.(8),Thee with thy wife and all thy train
3379,OM.(8),Returning to my town again.
3380,OM.(8),"Thy father, honoured Sage, is well,"
3381,OM.(8),Who hither from his woodland cell
3382,OM.(8),Has sent full many a messenger
3383,OM.(8),"For tidings both of thee and her."""
3384,OM.(8),"Then joyfully, for due respect,"
3385,OM.(8),The monarch bade the town be decked.
3386,OM.(8),The king and Rishyasring elate
3387,OM.(8),Entered the royal city's gate:
3388,OM.(8),In front the chaplain rode.
3389,OM.(8),"Then, loved and honoured with all care"
3390,OM.(8),"By monarch and by courtier, there"
3391,OM.(8),The glorious saint abode.

3397,OM.(8),
3398,OM.(8),
3399,OM.(8),The monarch called a Bráhman near
3400,OM.(8),"And said, ""Now speed away"
3401,OM.(8),"To Kasyap's son,(127) the mighty seer,"
3402,OM.(8),And with all reverence say
3403,OM.(8),"The holy child he holds so dear,"
3404,OM.(8),"The hermit of the noble mind,"
3405,OM.(8),"Whose equal it were hard to find,"
3406,OM.(8),"Returned, is dwelling here."
3407,OM.(8),"Go, and instead of me do thou"
3408,OM.(8),"Before that best of hermits bow,"
3409,OM.(8),"That still he may, for his dear son,"
3410,OM.(8),"Show me the favour I have won."""
3411,OM.(8),"Soon as the king these words had said,"
3412,OM.(8),To Kasyap's son the Bráhman sped.
3413,OM.(8),Before the hermit low he bent
3414,OM.(8),"And did obeisance, reverent;"
3415,OM.(8),Then with meek words his grace to crave
3416,OM.(8),The message of his lord he gave:
3417,OM.(8),"""The high-souled father of his bride"
3418,OM.(8),Had called thy son his rites to guide:
3419,OM.(8),"Those rites are o'er, the steed is slain;"
3420,OM.(8),"Thy noble child is come again."""
3421,OM.(8),
3422,OM.(8),Soon as the saint that speech had heard
3423,OM.(8),His spirit with desire was stirred
3424,OM.(8),To seek the city of the king
3425,OM.(8),And to his cot his son to bring.
3426,OM.(8),With young disciples at his side
3427,OM.(8),"Forth on his way the hermit hied,"
3428,OM.(8),While peasants from their hamlets ran
3429,OM.(8),To reverence the holy man.
3430,OM.(8),"Each with his little gift of food,"
3431,OM.(8),"Forth came the village multitude,"
3432,OM.(8),"And, as they humbly bowed the head,"
3433,OM.(8),"""What may we do for thee?"" they said."
3434,OM.(8),"Then he, of Bráhmans first and best,"
3435,OM.(8),The gathered people thus addressed:
3436,OM.(8),"""Now tell me for I fain would know,"
3437,OM.(8),"Why is it I am honoured so?"""
3438,OM.(8),They to the high-souled saint replied:
3439,OM.(8),"""Our ruler is with thee allied."
3440,OM.(8),Our master's order we fulfil;
3441,OM.(8),"O Bráhman, let thy mind be still."""
3442,OM.(8),
3443,OM.(8),With joy the saintly hermit heard
3444,OM.(8),"Each pleasant and delightful word,"
3445,OM.(8),And poured a benediction down
3446,OM.(8),On king and ministers and town.
3447,OM.(8),Glad at the words of that high saint
3448,OM.(8),Some servants hastened to acquaint
3449,OM.(8),"Their king, rejoicing to impart"
3450,OM.(8),The tidings that would cheer his heart.
3451,OM.(8),Soon as the joyful tale he knew
3452,OM.(8),"To meet the saint the monarch flew,"
3453,OM.(8),"The guest-gift in his hand he brought,"
3454,OM.(8),And bowed before him and besought:
3455,OM.(8),"""This day by seeing thee I gain"
3456,OM.(8),"Not to have lived my life in vain,"
3457,OM.(8),"Now be not wroth with me, I pray,"
3458,OM.(8),"""Because I wiled thy son away.(128)"
3459,OM.(8),
3460,OM.(8),The best of Bráhmans answer made:
3461,OM.(8),"""Be not, great lord of kings, afraid."
3462,OM.(8),Thy virtues have not failed to win
3463,OM.(8),"My favour, O thou pure of sin."""
3464,OM.(8),"Then in the front the saint was placed,"
3465,OM.(8),"The king came next in joyous haste,"
3466,OM.(8),"And with him entered his abode,"
3467,OM.(8),Mid glad acclaim as on they rode.
3468,OM.(8),To greet the sage the reverent crowd
3469,OM.(8),Raised suppliant hands and humbly bowed.
3470,OM.(8),Then from the palace many a dame
3471,OM.(8),"Following well-dressed Sántá came,"
3472,OM.(8),Stood by the mighty saint and cried:
3473,OM.(8),"""See, honour's source, thy son's dear bride."""
3474,OM.(8),"The saint, who every virtue knew,"
3475,OM.(8),"His arms around his daughter threw,"
3476,OM.(8),And with a father's rapture pressed
3477,OM.(8),The lady to his wondering breast.
3478,OM.(8),Arising from the saint's embrace
3479,OM.(8),"She bowed her low before his face,"
3480,OM.(8),"And then, with palm to palm applied,"
3481,OM.(8),Stood by her hermit father's side.
3482,OM.(8),"He for his son, as laws ordain,"
3483,OM.(8),"Performed the rite that frees from stain,(129)"
3484,OM.(8),"And, honoured by the wise and good,"
3485,OM.(8),With him departed to the wood.

3494,OM.(8),Had circled since that glorious rite.
3495,OM.(8),Eleven months had passed away;
3496,OM.(8),'Twas Chaitra's ninth returning day.(130)
3497,OM.(8),The moon within that mansion shone
3498,OM.(8),Which Aditi looks kindly on.
3499,OM.(8),Raised to their apex in the sky
3500,OM.(8),Five brilliant planets beamed on high.
3501,OM.(8),"Shone with the moon, in Cancer's sign,"
3502,OM.(8),Vrihaspati(131) with light divine.
3503,OM.(8),Kausalyá bore an infant blest
3504,OM.(8),With heavenly marks of grace impressed;
3505,OM.(8),"Ráma, the universe's lord,"
3506,OM.(8),A prince by all the worlds adored.
3507,OM.(8),New glory Queen Kausalyá won
3508,OM.(8),Reflected from her splendid son.
3509,OM.(8),"So Aditi shone more and more,"
3510,OM.(8),"The Mother of the Gods, when she"
3511,OM.(8),"The King of the Immortals(132) bore,"
3512,OM.(8),The thunder-wielding deity.
3513,OM.(8),"The lotus-eyed, the beauteous boy,"
3514,OM.(8),He came fierce Rávan to destroy;
3515,OM.(8),"From half of Vishnu's vigour born,"
3516,OM.(8),He came to help the worlds forlorn.
3517,OM.(8),And Queen Kaikeyí bore a child
3518,OM.(8),"Of truest valour, Bharat styled,"
3519,OM.(8),"With every princely virtue blest,"
3520,OM.(8),One fourth of Vishnu manifest.
3521,OM.(8),"Sumitrá too a noble pair,"
3522,OM.(8),"Called Lakshman and Satrughna, bare,"
3523,OM.(8),"Of high emprise, devoted, true,"
3524,OM.(8),Sharers in Vishnu's essence too.
3525,OM.(8),"'Neath Pushya's(133) mansion, Mina's(134) sign,"
3526,OM.(8),"Was Bharat born, of soul benign."
3527,OM.(8),The sun had reached the Crab at morn
3528,OM.(8),"When Queen Sumitrá's babes were born,"
3529,OM.(8),What time the moon had gone to make
3530,OM.(8),His nightly dwelling with the Snake.
3531,OM.(8),The high-souled monarch's consorts bore
3532,OM.(8),"At different times those glorious four,"
3533,OM.(8),"Like to himself and virtuous, bright"
3534,OM.(8),As Proshthapadá's(135) four-fold light.
3535,OM.(8),"Then danced the nymphs' celestial throng,"
3536,OM.(8),The minstrels raised their strain;
3537,OM.(8),"The drums of heaven pealed loud and long,"
3538,OM.(8),And flowers came down in rain.
3539,OM.(8),"Within Ayodhyá, blithe and gay,"
3540,OM.(8),All kept the joyous holiday.
3541,OM.(8),"The spacious square, the ample road"
3542,OM.(8),"With mimes and dancers overflowed,"
3543,OM.(8),And with the voice of music rang
3544,OM.(8),"Where minstrels played and singers sang,"
3545,OM.(8),"And shone, a wonder to behold,"
3546,OM.(8),With dazzling show of gems and gold.
3547,OM.(8),"Nor did the king his largess spare,"
3548,OM.(8),"For minstrel, driver, bard, to share;"
3549,OM.(8),"Much wealth the Bráhmans bore away,"
3550,OM.(8),And many thousand dine that day.
3551,OM.(8),
3552,OM.(8),Soon as each babe was twelve days old
3553,OM.(8),'Twas time the naming rite to hold.
3554,OM.(8),"When Saint Vasishtha, rapt with joy,"

3561,OM.(8),"Like some proud banner cheered his sight,"
3562,OM.(8),And to all creatures seemed to be
3563,OM.(8),The self-existent deity.
3564,OM.(8),"All heroes, versed in holy lore,"
3565,OM.(8),To all mankind great love they bore.
3566,OM.(8),"Fair stores of wisdom all possessed,"
3567,OM.(8),With princely graces all were blest.
3568,OM.(8),"But mid those youths of high descent,"
3569,OM.(8),With lordly light preëminent.
3570,OM.(8),"Like the full moon unclouded, shone"
3571,OM.(8),"Ráma, the world's dear paragon."
3572,OM.(8),He best the elephant could guide.(137)
3573,OM.(8),"Urge the fleet car, the charger ride:"
3574,OM.(8),"A master he of bowman's skill,"
3575,OM.(8),Joying to do his father's will.
3576,OM.(8),"The world's delight and darling, he"
3577,OM.(8),Loved Lakshman best from infancy
3578,OM.(8),"And Lakshman, lord of lofty fate,"
3579,OM.(8),"Upon his elder joyed to wait,"
3580,OM.(8),Striving his second self to please
3581,OM.(8),With friendship's sweet observances.
3582,OM.(8),His limbs the hero ne'er would rest
3583,OM.(8),Unless the couch his brother pressed;
3584,OM.(8),Except beloved Ráma shared
3585,OM.(8),He could not taste the meal prepared.
3586,OM.(8),"When Ráma, pride of Reghu's race,"
3587,OM.(8),"Sprang on his steed to urge the chase,"
3588,OM.(8),Behind him Lakshman loved to go
3589,OM.(8),And guard him with his trusty bow.
3590,OM.(8),As Ráma was to Lakshman dear
3591,OM.(8),"More than his life and ever near,"
3592,OM.(8),So fond Satrughna prized above
3593,OM.(8),His very life his Bharat's love.
3594,OM.(8),"Illustrious heroes, nobly kind"
3595,OM.(8),"In mutual love they all combined,"
3596,OM.(8),And gave their royal sire delight
3597,OM.(8),With modest grace and warrior might:
3598,OM.(8),Supported by the glorious four
3599,OM.(8),"Shone Dasaratha more and more,"
3600,OM.(8),"As though, with every guardian God"
3601,OM.(8),"Who keeps the land and skies,"

3610,OM.(8),
3611,OM.(8),Now Dasaratha's pious mind
3612,OM.(8),Meet wedlock for his sons designed;
3613,OM.(8),With priests and friends the king began
3614,OM.(8),To counsel and prepare his plan.
3615,OM.(8),"Such thoughts engaged his bosom, when,"
3616,OM.(8),"To see Ayodhyá's lord of men,"
3617,OM.(8),"A mighty saint of glorious fame,"
3618,OM.(8),The hermit Visvámitra(138) came.
3619,OM.(8),For evil fiends that roam by night
3620,OM.(8),"Disturbed him in each holy rite,"
3621,OM.(8),And in their strength and frantic rage
3622,OM.(8),Assailed with witcheries the sage.
3623,OM.(8),He came to seek the monarch's aid
3624,OM.(8),"To guard the rites the demons stayed,"
3625,OM.(8),Unable to a close to bring
3626,OM.(8),One unpolluted offering.
3627,OM.(8),Seeking the king in this dire strait
3628,OM.(8),He said to those who kept the gate:
3629,OM.(8),"""Haste, warders, to your master run,"
3630,OM.(8),"And say that here stands Gádhi's son."""
3631,OM.(8),
3632,OM.(8),"Soon as they heard the holy man,"
3633,OM.(8),To the king's chamber swift they ran
3634,OM.(8),"With minds disordered all, and spurred"
3635,OM.(8),To wildest zeal by what they heard.
3636,OM.(8),"On to the royal hall they sped,"
3637,OM.(8),"There stood and lowly bowed the head,"
3638,OM.(8),And made the lord of men aware
3639,OM.(8),That the great saint was waiting there.
3640,OM.(8),The king with priest and peer arose
3641,OM.(8),"And ran the sage to meet,"
3642,OM.(8),As Indra from his palace goes
3643,OM.(8),Lord Brahmá's self to greet.
3644,OM.(8),When glowing with celestial light
3645,OM.(8),"The pious hermit was in sight,"
3646,OM.(8),"The king, whose mien his transport showed,"
3647,OM.(8),The honoured gift for guests bestowed.
3648,OM.(8),"Nor did the saint that gift despise,"
3649,OM.(8),Offered as holy texts advise;
3650,OM.(8),He kindly asked the earth's great king
3651,OM.(8),How all with him was prospering.
3652,OM.(8),The son of Kusik(139) bade him tell
3653,OM.(8),"If all in town and field were well,"
3654,OM.(8),"All well with friends, and kith and kin,"
3655,OM.(8),And royal treasure stored within:
3656,OM.(8),"""Do all thy neighbours own thy sway?"
3657,OM.(8),Thy foes confess thee yet?
3658,OM.(8),Dost thou continue still to pay
3659,OM.(8),"To Gods and men each debt?"""
3660,OM.(8),"Then he, of hermits first and best,"
3661,OM.(8),"Vasishtha with a smile(140) addressed,"
3662,OM.(8),"And asked him of his welfare too,"
3663,OM.(8),Showing him honour as was due.
3664,OM.(8),Then with the sainted hermit all
3665,OM.(8),"Went joyous to the monarch's hall,"
3666,OM.(8),"And sate them down by due degree,"
3667,OM.(8),"Each one, of rank and dignity."
3668,OM.(8),Joy filled the noble prince's breast
3669,OM.(8),Who thus bespoke the honoured guest:
3670,OM.(8),"""As amrit(141) by a mortal found,"
3671,OM.(8),"As rain upon the thirsty ground,"
3672,OM.(8),As to an heirless man a son
3673,OM.(8),"Born to him of his precious one,"
3674,OM.(8),"As gain of what we sorely miss,"
3675,OM.(8),"As sudden dawn of mighty bliss,"
3676,OM.(8),So is thy coming here to me:
3677,OM.(8),"All welcome, mighty Saint, to thee."
3678,OM.(8),What wish within thy heart hast thou?
3679,OM.(8),"If I can please thee, tell me how."
3680,OM.(8),"Hail, Saint, from whom all honours flow,"
3681,OM.(8),Worthy of all I can bestow.
3682,OM.(8),"Blest is my birth with fruit to-day,"
3683,OM.(8),Nor has my life been thrown away.
3684,OM.(8),I see the best of Bráhman race
3685,OM.(8),And night to glorious morn gives place.
3686,OM.(8),"Thou, holy Sage, in days of old"
3687,OM.(8),"Among the royal saints enrolled,"
3688,OM.(8),"Didst, penance-glorified, within"
3689,OM.(8),The Bráhman caste high station win.
3690,OM.(8),'Tis meet and right in many a way
3691,OM.(8),That I to thee should honour pay.
3692,OM.(8),This seems a marvel to mine eyes:
3693,OM.(8),All sin thy visit purifies;
3694,OM.(8),"And I by seeing thee, O Sage,"
3695,OM.(8),Have reaped the fruit of pilgrimage.
3696,OM.(8),"Then say what thou wouldst have me do,"
3697,OM.(8),That thou hast sought this interview.
3698,OM.(8),"Favoured by thee, my wish is still,"
3699,OM.(8),"O Hermit, to perform thy will."
3700,OM.(8),Nor needest thou at length explain
3701,OM.(8),The object that thy heart would gain.
3702,OM.(8),Without reserve I grant it now:
3703,OM.(8),"My deity, O Lord, art thou."""
3704,OM.(8),
3705,OM.(8),"The glorious hermit, far renowned,"
3706,OM.(8),"With highest fame and virtue crowned,"
3707,OM.(8),Rejoiced these modest words to hear
3708,OM.(8),Delightful to the mind and ear.

3716,OM.(8),The hermit heard with high content
3717,OM.(8),"That speech so wondrous eloquent,"
3718,OM.(8),"And while each hair with joy arose,(142)"
3719,OM.(8),He thus made answer at the close:
3720,OM.(8),"""Good is thy speech O noble King,"
3721,OM.(8),And like thyself in everything.
3722,OM.(8),So should their lips be wisdom-fraught
3723,OM.(8),"Whom kings begot, Vasishtha taught."
3724,OM.(8),The favour which I came to seek
3725,OM.(8),Thou grantest ere my tongue can speak.
3726,OM.(8),"But let my tale attention claim,"
3727,OM.(8),And hear the need for which I came.
3728,OM.(8),"O King, as Scripture texts allow,"
3729,OM.(8),A holy rite employs me now.
3730,OM.(8),Two fiends who change their forms at will
3731,OM.(8),Impede that rite with cursed skill.(143)
3732,OM.(8),"Oft when the task is nigh complete,"
3733,OM.(8),"These worst of fiends my toil defeat,"
3734,OM.(8),"Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o'er"
3735,OM.(8),The altar shed a stream of gore.
3736,OM.(8),"When thus the rite is mocked and stayed,"
3737,OM.(8),"And all my pious hopes delayed,"
3738,OM.(8),"Cast down in heart the spot I leave,"
3739,OM.(8),And spent with fruitless labour grieve.
3740,OM.(8),"Nor can I, checked by prudence, dare"
3741,OM.(8),Let loose my fury on them there:
3742,OM.(8),"The muttered curse, the threatening word,"
3743,OM.(8),In such a rite must ne'er be heard.
3744,OM.(8),Thy grace the rite from check can free.
3745,OM.(8),And yield the fruit I long to see.
3746,OM.(8),"Thy duty bids thee, King, defend"
3747,OM.(8),"The suffering guest, the suppliant friend."
3748,OM.(8),"Give me thy son, thine eldest born,"
3749,OM.(8),Whom locks like raven's wings adorn.
3750,OM.(8),"That hero youth, the truly brave,"
3751,OM.(8),"Of thee, O glorious King, I crave."
3752,OM.(8),For he can lay those demons low
3753,OM.(8),Who mar my rites and work me woe:
3754,OM.(8),"My power shall shield the youth from harm,"
3755,OM.(8),And heavenly might shall nerve his arm.
3756,OM.(8),And on my champion will I shower
3757,OM.(8),"Unnumbered gifts of varied power,"
3758,OM.(8),Such gifts as shall ensure his fame
3759,OM.(8),And spread through all the worlds his name.
3760,OM.(8),Be sure those fiends can never stand
3761,OM.(8),"Before the might of Ráma's hand,"
3762,OM.(8),And mid the best and bravest none
3763,OM.(8),Can slay that pair but Raghu's son.
3764,OM.(8),Entangled in the toils of Fate
3765,OM.(8),"Those sinners, proud and obstinate,"
3766,OM.(8),"Are, in their fury overbold,"
3767,OM.(8),No match for Ráma mighty-souled.
3768,OM.(8),Nor let a father's breast give way
3769,OM.(8),Too far to fond affection's sway.
3770,OM.(8),Count thou the fiends already slain:
3771,OM.(8),"My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain."
3772,OM.(8),I know the hero Ráma well
3773,OM.(8),In whom high thoughts and valour dwell;
3774,OM.(8),"So does Vasishtha, so do these"
3775,OM.(8),Engaged in long austerities.
3776,OM.(8),"If thou would do the righteous deed,"
3777,OM.(8),"And win high fame, thy virtue's meed,"
3778,OM.(8),"Fame that on earth shall last and live,"
3779,OM.(8),"To me, great King, thy Ráma give."
3780,OM.(8),"If to the words that I have said,"
3781,OM.(8),With Saint Vasishtha at their head
3782,OM.(8),"Thy holy men, O King, agree,"
3783,OM.(8),Then let thy Ráma go with me.
3784,OM.(8),"Ten nights my sacrifice will last,"
3785,OM.(8),And ere the stated time be past
3786,OM.(8),"Those wicked fiends, those impious twain,"
3787,OM.(8),Must fall by wondrous Ráma slain.
3788,OM.(8),"Let not the hours, I warn thee, fly,"
3789,OM.(8),"Fixt for the rite, unheeded by;"
3790,OM.(8),"Good luck have thou, O royal Chief,"
3791,OM.(8),"Nor give thy heart to needless grief."""
3792,OM.(8),
3793,OM.(8),Thus in fair words with virtue fraught
3794,OM.(8),The pious glorious saint besought.
3795,OM.(8),But the good speech with poignant sting
3796,OM.(8),"Pierced ear and bosom of the king,"
3797,OM.(8),"Who, stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear,"
3798,OM.(8),Fell prostrate and lay fainting there.

3807,OM.(8),"While the hapless monarch lay,"
3808,OM.(8),Then slowly gathering thought and strength
3809,OM.(8),To Visvámitra spoke at length:
3810,OM.(8),"""My son is but a child, I ween;"
3811,OM.(8),This year he will be just sixteen.
3812,OM.(8),"How is he fit for such emprise,"
3813,OM.(8),My darling with the lotus eyes?
3814,OM.(8),A mighty army will I bring
3815,OM.(8),"That calls me master, lord, and king,"
3816,OM.(8),And with its countless squadrons fight
3817,OM.(8),Against these rovers of the night.
3818,OM.(8),My faithful heroes skilled to wield
3819,OM.(8),The arms of war will take the field;
3820,OM.(8),Their skill the demons' might may break:
3821,OM.(8),"Ráma, my child, thou must not take."
3822,OM.(8),"I, even I, my bow in hand,"
3823,OM.(8),"Will in the van of battle stand,"
3824,OM.(8),"And, while my soul is left alive,"
3825,OM.(8),With the night-roaming demons strive.
3826,OM.(8),Thy guarded sacrifice shall be
3827,OM.(8),"Completed, from all hindrance free."
3828,OM.(8),Thither will I my journey make:
3829,OM.(8),"Ráma, my child, thou must not take."
3830,OM.(8),"A boy unskilled, he knows not yet"
3831,OM.(8),The bounds to strength and weakness set.
3832,OM.(8),No match is he for demon foes
3833,OM.(8),Who magic arts to arms oppose.
3834,OM.(8),"O chief of saints, I have no power,"
3835,OM.(8),"Of Ráma reft, to live one hour:"
3836,OM.(8),Mine aged heart at once would break:
3837,OM.(8),"Ráma, my child, thou must not take."
3838,OM.(8),Nine thousand circling years have fled
3839,OM.(8),"With all their seasons o'er my head,"
3840,OM.(8),"And as a hard-won boon, O sage,"
3841,OM.(8),These sons have come to cheer mine age.
3842,OM.(8),My dearest love amid the four
3843,OM.(8),"Is he whom first his mother bore,"
3844,OM.(8),Still dearer for his virtues' sake:
3845,OM.(8),"Ráma, my child, thou must not take."
3846,OM.(8),"But if, unmoved by all I say,"
3847,OM.(8),"Thou needs must bear my son away,"
3848,OM.(8),"Let me lead with him, I entreat,"
3849,OM.(8),A four-fold army(144) all complete.
3850,OM.(8),"What is the demons' might, O Sage?"
3851,OM.(8),Who are they? What their parentage?
3852,OM.(8),What is their size? What beings lend
3853,OM.(8),Their power to guard them and befriend?
3854,OM.(8),How can my son their arts withstand?
3855,OM.(8),Or I or all my armed band?
3856,OM.(8),Tell me the whole that I may know
3857,OM.(8),To meet in war each evil foe
3858,OM.(8),"Whom conscious might inspires with pride."""
3859,OM.(8),
3860,OM.(8),And Visvámitra thus replied:
3861,OM.(8),"""Sprung from Pulastya's race there came"
3862,OM.(8),A giant known by Rávan's name.
3863,OM.(8),Once favoured by the Eternal Sire
3864,OM.(8),"He plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,"
3865,OM.(8),"For peerless power and might renowned,"
3866,OM.(8),By giant bands encompassed round.
3867,OM.(8),"Visravas for his sire they hold,"
3868,OM.(8),His brother is the Lord of Gold.
3869,OM.(8),"King of the giant hosts is he,"
3870,OM.(8),And worst of all in cruelty.
3871,OM.(8),This Rávan's dread commands impel
3872,OM.(8),"Two demons who in might excel,"
3873,OM.(8),"Márícha and Suváhu hight,"
3874,OM.(8),"To trouble and impede the rite."""
3875,OM.(8),
3876,OM.(8),Then thus the king addressed the sage:
3877,OM.(8),"""No power have I, my lord, to wage"
3878,OM.(8),War with this evil-minded foe;
3879,OM.(8),"Now pity on my darling show,"
3880,OM.(8),"And upon me of hapless fate,"
3881,OM.(8),For thee as God I venerate.
3882,OM.(8),"Gods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth,(145)"
3883,OM.(8),"The birds of air, the snakes of earth"
3884,OM.(8),"Before the might of Rávan quail,"
3885,OM.(8),Much less can mortal man avail.
3886,OM.(8),"He draws, I hear, from out the breast"
3887,OM.(8),The valour of the mightiest.
3888,OM.(8),"No, ne'er can I with him contend,"
3889,OM.(8),Or with the forces he may send.
3890,OM.(8),"How can I then my darling lend,"
3891,OM.(8),"Godlike, unskilled in battle? No,"
3892,OM.(8),I will not let my young child go.
3893,OM.(8),"Foes of thy rite, those mighty ones,"
3894,OM.(8),"Sunda and Upasunda's sons,"
3895,OM.(8),Are fierce as Fate to overthrow:
3896,OM.(8),I will not let my young child go.
3897,OM.(8),Márícha and Suváhu fell
3898,OM.(8),Are valiant and instructed well.
3899,OM.(8),One of the twain I might attack.

3912,OM.(8),"""Didst thou, O King, a promise make,"
3913,OM.(8),And wishest now thy word to break?
3914,OM.(8),A son of Raghu's line should scorn
3915,OM.(8),"To fail in faith, a man forsworn."
3916,OM.(8),But if thy soul can bear the shame
3917,OM.(8),I will return e'en as I came.

3924,OM.(8),And fear upon the Immortals came.
3925,OM.(8),"But Saint Vasishtha, wisest seer,"
3926,OM.(8),"Observant of his vows austere,"
3927,OM.(8),"Saw the whole world convulsed with dread,"
3928,OM.(8),And thus unto the monarch said:
3929,OM.(8),"""Thou, born of old Ikshváku's seed,"
3930,OM.(8),Art Justice' self in mortal weed.
3931,OM.(8),"Constant and pious, blest by fate,"

3939,OM.(8),"Then, Monarch, let thy Ráma go,"
3940,OM.(8),Nor fear for him the demon foe.
3941,OM.(8),The fiends shall have no power to hurt
3942,OM.(8),"Him trained to war or inexpert,"
3943,OM.(8),"Nor vanquish him in battle field,"
3944,OM.(8),For Kusik's son the youth will shield.

4035,OM.(8),No one is there in all the land
4036,OM.(8),Thine equal for the vigorous hand.
4037,OM.(8),"Thou, when thy lips pronounce the spell,"
4038,OM.(8),Shalt have no peer in heaven or hell.
4039,OM.(8),"None in the world with thee shall vie,"
4040,OM.(8),"O sinless one, in apt reply,"

4043,OM.(8),"This double science take, and gain"
4044,OM.(8),Glory that shall for aye remain.
4045,OM.(8),Wisdom and judgment spring from each
4046,OM.(8),Of these fair spells whose use I teach.
4047,OM.(8),"Hunger and thirst unknown to thee,"

4122,OM.(8),Dissolved the shape that was so fair

4125,OM.(8),"Destroyed his form and frame,"

4156,OM.(8),The evening prayers were duly said

4175,OM.(8),To yonder side thy prosperous way
4176,OM.(8),"With naught to check thee or delay."""
4177,OM.(8),
4178,OM.(8),Nor did the saint their rede reject:
4179,OM.(8),"He bade farewell with due respect,"
4180,OM.(8),"And crossed, attended by the twain,"
4181,OM.(8),That river rushing to the main.
4182,OM.(8),"When now the bark was half way o'er,"
4183,OM.(8),"Ráma and Lakshman heard the roar,"
4184,OM.(8),"That louder grew and louder yet,"
4185,OM.(8),Of waves by dashing waters met.
4186,OM.(8),Then Ráma asked the mighty seer:
4187,OM.(8),"""What is the tumult that I hear"
4188,OM.(8),"Of waters cleft in mid career?"""
4189,OM.(8),"Soon as the speech of Ráma, stirred"
4190,OM.(8),"By deep desire to know, he heard,"
4191,OM.(8),The pious saint began to tell
4192,OM.(8),What paused the waters' roar and swell:
4193,OM.(8),"""On high Kailása's distant hill"
4194,OM.(8),There lies a noble lake
4195,OM.(8),"Whose waters, born from Brahmá's will,"
4196,OM.(8),The name of Mánas(158) take.
4197,OM.(8),"Thence, hallowing where'er they flow,"
4198,OM.(8),"The streams of Sarjú fall,"
4199,OM.(8),And wandering through the plains below
4200,OM.(8),Embrace Ayodhyá's wall.
4201,OM.(8),"Still, still preserved in Sarjú's name"
4202,OM.(8),Sarovar's(159) fame we trace.
4203,OM.(8),The flood of Brahma whence she came
4204,OM.(8),To run her holy race.
4205,OM.(8),To meet great Gangá here she hies
4206,OM.(8),With tributary wave:
4207,OM.(8),"Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,"
4208,OM.(8),Of floods that swell and rave.
4209,OM.(8),"Here, pride of Raghu's line, do thou"
4210,OM.(8),"In humble adoration bow."""
4211,OM.(8),
4212,OM.(8),"He spoke. The princes both obeyed,"
4213,OM.(8),And reverence to each river paid.(160)
4214,OM.(8),"They reached the southern shore at last,"
4215,OM.(8),And gaily on their journey passed.
4216,OM.(8),A little space beyond there stood
4217,OM.(8),A gloomy awe-inspiring wood.
4218,OM.(8),The monarch's noble son began
4219,OM.(8),To question thus the holy man:
4220,OM.(8),"""Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye"
4221,OM.(8),Like some vast cloud that fills the sky?
4222,OM.(8),"Pathless and dark it seems to be,"
4223,OM.(8),Where birds in thousands wander free;
4224,OM.(8),"Where shrill cicadas' cries resound,"
4225,OM.(8),And fowl of dismal note abound.
4226,OM.(8),"Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,"
4227,OM.(8),"Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,"
4228,OM.(8),There shrubs and thorns run wild:
4229,OM.(8),"Dháo, Sál, Bignonia, Bel,(161) are found,"
4230,OM.(8),And every tree that grows on ground.
4231,OM.(8),"How is the forest styled?"""
4232,OM.(8),The glorious saint this answer made:
4233,OM.(8),"""Dear child of Raghu, hear"
4234,OM.(8),Who dwells within the horrid shade
4235,OM.(8),That looks so dark and drear.
4236,OM.(8),"Where now is wood, long ere this day"
4237,OM.(8),"Two broad and fertile lands,"
4238,OM.(8),"Malaja and Karúsha lay,"
4239,OM.(8),Adorned by heavenly hands.
4240,OM.(8),"Here, mourning friendship's broken ties,"
4241,OM.(8),Lord Indra of the thousand eyes
4242,OM.(8),"Hungered and sorrowed many a day,"
4243,OM.(8),"His brightness soiled with mud and clay,"
4244,OM.(8),When in a storm of passion he
4245,OM.(8),Had slain his dear friend Namuchi.
4246,OM.(8),Then came the Gods and saints who bore
4247,OM.(8),Their golden pitchers brimming o'er
4248,OM.(8),"With holy streams that banish stain,"
4249,OM.(8),And bathed Lord Indra pure again.
4250,OM.(8),When in this land the God was freed
4251,OM.(8),From spot and stain of impious deed
4252,OM.(8),"For that his own dear friend he slew,"
4253,OM.(8),High transport thrilled his bosom through.
4254,OM.(8),"Then in his joy the lands he blessed,"
4255,OM.(8),And gave a boon they long possessed:
4256,OM.(8),"""Because these fertile lands retain"
4257,OM.(8),"The washings of the blot and stain,"""
4258,OM.(8),"'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,"
4259,OM.(8),"""Malaja and Karúsha's name"
4260,OM.(8),Shall celebrate with deathless fame
4261,OM.(8),"My malady and care.""(162)"
4262,OM.(8),"""So be it,"" all the Immortals cried,"
4263,OM.(8),"When Indra's speech they heard,"
4264,OM.(8),And with acclaim they ratified
4265,OM.(8),The names his lips conferred.
4266,OM.(8),"Long time, O victor of thy foes,"
4267,OM.(8),"These happy lands had sweet repose,"
4268,OM.(8),And higher still in fortune rose.
4269,OM.(8),"At length a spirit, loving ill,"
4270,OM.(8),"Tádaká, wearing shapes at will,"
4271,OM.(8),"Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast,"
4272,OM.(8),"A thousand elephants, surpassed,"
4273,OM.(8),"Was to fierce Sunda, lord and head"
4274,OM.(8),"Of all the demon armies, wed."
4275,OM.(8),"From her, Lord Indra's peer in might"
4276,OM.(8),Giant Márícha sprang to light:
4277,OM.(8),"And she, a constant plague and pest,"
4278,OM.(8),These two fair realms has long distressed.
4279,OM.(8),Now dwelling in her dark abode
4280,OM.(8),A league away she bars the road:
4281,OM.(8),"And we, O Ráma, hence must go"
4282,OM.(8),Where lies the forest of the foe.
4283,OM.(8),"Now on thine own right arm rely,"
4284,OM.(8),And my command obey:
4285,OM.(8),"Smite the foul monster that she die,"
4286,OM.(8),And take the plague away.
4287,OM.(8),To reach this country none may dare
4288,OM.(8),"Fallen from its old estate,"
4289,OM.(8),"Which she, whose fury naught can bear,"
4290,OM.(8),Has left so desolate.
4291,OM.(8),And now my truthful tale is told
4292,OM.(8),How with accursed sway
4293,OM.(8),"The spirit plagued this wood of old,"
4294,OM.(8),"And ceases not to-day."""

4303,OM.(8),"Had closed that story strange to hear,"
4304,OM.(8),Ráma again the saint addressed
4305,OM.(8),To set one lingering doubt at rest:
4306,OM.(8),"""O holy man, 'tis said by all"
4307,OM.(8),That spirits' strength is weak and small:
4308,OM.(8),"How can she match, of power so slight,"

4311,OM.(8),To Raghu's son the glorified:
4312,OM.(8),"""Listen, and I will tell thee how"
4313,OM.(8),She gained the strength that arms her now.
4314,OM.(8),A mighty spirit lived of yore;
4315,OM.(8),Suketu was the name he bore.
4316,OM.(8),"Childless was he, and free from crime"
4317,OM.(8),In rites austere he passed his time.
4318,OM.(8),The mighty Sire was pleased to show
4319,OM.(8),"His favour, and a child bestow."
4320,OM.(8),"Tádaká named, most fair to see,"
4321,OM.(8),"A pearl among the maids was she,"

4323,OM.(8),A thousand elephants in power.
4324,OM.(8),"Nor would the Eternal Sire, although"
4325,OM.(8),"The spirit longed, a son bestow"
4326,OM.(8),That maid in beauty's youthful pride
4327,OM.(8),Was given to Sunda for a bride.
4328,OM.(8),"Her son, Márícha was his name,"
4329,OM.(8),"A giant, through a curse, became."

4332,OM.(8),"Inflamed with hunger's wildest rage,"
4333,OM.(8),Roaring she rushed upon the sage.
4334,OM.(8),"When the great hermit saw her near,"
4335,OM.(8),"On speeding in her fierce career,"
4336,OM.(8),He thus pronounced Márícha's doom:
4337,OM.(8),"""A giant's form and shape assume."""
4338,OM.(8),"And then, by mighty anger swayed,"
4339,OM.(8),On Tádaká this curse he laid:
4340,OM.(8),"""Thy present form and semblance quit,"
4341,OM.(8),And wear a shape thy mood to fit;
4342,OM.(8),"Changed form and feature by my ban,"
4343,OM.(8),"A fearful thing that feeds on man."""
4344,OM.(8),
4345,OM.(8),"She, by his awful curse possessed,"

4347,OM.(8),Has on this land her fury dealt
4348,OM.(8),Where once the saint Agastya dwelt.
4349,OM.(8),"Go, Ráma, smite this monster dead,"
4350,OM.(8),"The wicked plague, of power so dread,"
4351,OM.(8),And further by this deed of thine
4352,OM.(8),The good of Bráhmans and of kine.
4353,OM.(8),"Thy hand alone can overthrow,"
4354,OM.(8),"In all the worlds, this impious foe."
4355,OM.(8),Nor let compassion lead thy mind
4356,OM.(8),To shrink from blood of womankind;
4357,OM.(8),A monarch's son must ever count
4358,OM.(8),"The people's welfare paramount,"

4401,OM.(8),Scared by the mighty clang the deer
4402,OM.(8),"That roamed the forest shook with fear,"
4403,OM.(8),"And Tádaká the echo heard,"
4404,OM.(8),And rose in haste from slumber stirred.
4405,OM.(8),"In wild amaze, her soul aflame"
4406,OM.(8),With fury toward the spot she came.
4407,OM.(8),When that foul shape of evil mien
4408,OM.(8),And stature vast as e'er was seen
4409,OM.(8),"The wrathful son of Raghu eyed,"
4410,OM.(8),He thus unto his brother cried:

4412,OM.(8),A form to shudder at and flee.
4413,OM.(8),The hideous monster's very view
4414,OM.(8),Would cleave a timid heart in two.
4415,OM.(8),"Behold the demon hard to smite,"
4416,OM.(8),Defended by her magic might.
4417,OM.(8),"My hand shall stay her course to-day,"
4418,OM.(8),And shear her nose and ears away.
4419,OM.(8),No heart have I her life to take:
4420,OM.(8),I spare it for her sex's sake.
4421,OM.(8),"My will is but, with minished force,"
4422,OM.(8),"To check her in her evil course."""
4423,OM.(8),"While thus he spoke, by rage impelled"

4425,OM.(8),The fiend her course at Ráma held
4426,OM.(8),With huge arms tossed on high.
4427,OM.(8),"Her, rushing on, the seer assailed"
4428,OM.(8),With a loud cry of hate;
4429,OM.(8),And thus the sons of Raghu hailed:
4430,OM.(8),"""Fight, and be fortunate."""
4431,OM.(8),Then from the earth a horrid cloud
4432,OM.(8),"Of dust the demon raised,"
4433,OM.(8),And for awhile in darkling shroud
4434,OM.(8),Wrapt Raghu's sons amazed.
4435,OM.(8),Then calling on her magic power
4436,OM.(8),"The fearful fight to wage,"
4437,OM.(8),"She smote him with a stony shower,"
4438,OM.(8),Till Ráma burned with rage.
4439,OM.(8),Then pouring forth his arrowy rain
4440,OM.(8),"That stony flood to stay,"
4441,OM.(8),"With winged darts, as she charged amain,"
4442,OM.(8),He shore her hands away.
4443,OM.(8),As Tádaká still thundered near
4444,OM.(8),"Thus maimed by Ráma's blows,"
4445,OM.(8),Lakshman in fury severed sheer
4446,OM.(8),The monster's ears and nose.
4447,OM.(8),Assuming by her magic skill
4448,OM.(8),"A fresh and fresh disguise,"
4449,OM.(8),"She tried a thousand shapes at will,"

4469,OM.(8),"Though skilled in guile and magic lore,"
4470,OM.(8),Rushed on the brothers with a roar.
4471,OM.(8),"Deformed, terrific, murderous, dread,"
4472,OM.(8),"Swift as the levin on she sped,"
4473,OM.(8),"Like cloudy pile in autumn's sky,"

4478,OM.(8),"With lightning speed and surest aim,"

4587,OM.(8),The dart that Káma prizes much.
4588,OM.(8),I give the arm of shadowy powers
4589,OM.(8),That bleeding flesh of men devours.
4590,OM.(8),I give the arms the God of Gold
4591,OM.(8),And giant fiends exult to hold.

4598,OM.(8),I give thee as a priceless boon

4615,OM.(8),He muttered low the spell whose call
4616,OM.(8),Summons those arms and rules them all
4617,OM.(8),"And, each in visible form and frame,"
4618,OM.(8),Before the monarch's son they came.
4619,OM.(8),They stood and spoke in reverent guise

4672,OM.(8),Celestial in their bright attire
4673,OM.(8),Some shone like coals of burning fire;
4674,OM.(8),Some were like clouds of dusky smoke;
4675,OM.(8),And suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:

4686,OM.(8),And as they came so went away.
4687,OM.(8),"When thus the arms had homeward flown,"
4688,OM.(8),"With pleasant words and modest tone,"
4689,OM.(8),"E'en as he walked, the prince began"
4690,OM.(8),To question thus the holy man:
4691,OM.(8),"""What cloudlike wood is that which near"
4692,OM.(8),The mountain's side I see appear?
4693,OM.(8),"O tell me, for I long to know;"
4694,OM.(8),Its pleasant aspect charms me so.
4695,OM.(8),"Its glades are full of deer at play,"
4696,OM.(8),"And sweet birds sing on every spray,"
4697,OM.(8),Past is the hideous wild; I feel
4698,OM.(8),"So sweet a tremor o'er me steal,"

4721,OM.(8),And thus replied the anchorite:
4722,OM.(8),"""Chief of the mighty arm, of yore"
4723,OM.(8),"Lord Vishnu whom the Gods adore,"
4724,OM.(8),For holy thought and rites austere
4725,OM.(8),Of penance made his dwelling here.
4726,OM.(8),This ancient wood was called of old
4727,OM.(8),"Grove of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,"
4728,OM.(8),And when perfection he attained
4729,OM.(8),The grove the name of Perfect gained.
4730,OM.(8),"Bali of yore, Virochan's son,"
4731,OM.(8),"Dominion over Indra won,"
4732,OM.(8),"And when with power his proud heart swelled,"
4733,OM.(8),O'er the three worlds his empire held.
4734,OM.(8),"When Bali then began a rite,"
4735,OM.(8),The Gods and Indra in affright
4736,OM.(8),"Sought Vishnu in this place of rest,"
4737,OM.(8),And thus with prayers the God addressed:
4738,OM.(8),"""Bali. Virochan's mighty son,"
4739,OM.(8),His sacrifice has now begun:
4740,OM.(8),"Of boundless wealth, that demon king"
4741,OM.(8),Is bounteous to each living thing.
4742,OM.(8),Though suppliants flock from every side
4743,OM.(8),The suit of none is e'er denied.
4744,OM.(8),"Whate'er, where'er howe'er the call,"
4745,OM.(8),He hears the suit and gives to all.
4746,OM.(8),Now with thine own illusive art
4747,OM.(8),"Perform, O Lord, the helper's part:"
4748,OM.(8),"Assume a dwarfish form, and thus"
4749,OM.(8),"From fear and danger rescue us.""(167)"
4750,OM.(8),
4751,OM.(8),Thus in their dread the Immortals sued:
4752,OM.(8),The God a dwarflike shape indued:(168)
4753,OM.(8),"Before Virochan's son he came,"
4754,OM.(8),Three steps of land his only claim.
4755,OM.(8),"The boon obtained, in wondrous wise"
4756,OM.(8),Lord Vishnu's form increased in size;
4757,OM.(8),"Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,"
4758,OM.(8),"God of the Triple Step, he passed.(169)"
4759,OM.(8),The whole broad earth from side to side
4760,OM.(8),"He measured with one mighty stride,"
4761,OM.(8),"Spanned with the next the firmament,"
4762,OM.(8),And with the third through heaven he went.
4763,OM.(8),Thus was the king of demons hurled
4764,OM.(8),"By Vishnu to the nether world,"
4765,OM.(8),And thus the universe restored
4766,OM.(8),"To Indra's rule, its ancient lord."
4767,OM.(8),And now because the immortal God
4768,OM.(8),"This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,"
4769,OM.(8),The grove has aye been loved by me
4770,OM.(8),For reverence of the devotee.
4771,OM.(8),"But demons haunt it, prompt to stay"
4772,OM.(8),Each holy offering I would pay.
4773,OM.(8),"Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill"
4774,OM.(8),These giants that delight in ill.
4775,OM.(8),"This day, beloved child, our feet"
4776,OM.(8),Shall rest within the calm retreat:

4782,OM.(8),With Ráma and his brother stood
4783,OM.(8),Within the consecrated wood.
4784,OM.(8),"Soon as they saw the holy man,"
4785,OM.(8),With one accord together ran
4786,OM.(8),"The dwellers in the sacred shade,"
4787,OM.(8),"And to the saint their reverence paid,"
4788,OM.(8),"And offered water for his feet,"
4789,OM.(8),The gift of honour and a seat;
4790,OM.(8),And next with hospitable care
4791,OM.(8),They entertained the princely pair.
4792,OM.(8),The royal tamers of their foes
4793,OM.(8),Rested awhile in sweet repose:
4794,OM.(8),Then to the chief of hermits sued
4795,OM.(8),Standing in suppliant attitude:
4796,OM.(8),"""Begin, O best of saints, we pray,"
4797,OM.(8),Initiatory rites to-day.
4798,OM.(8),This Perfect Grove shall be anew
4799,OM.(8),"Made perfect, and thy words be true."""
4800,OM.(8),
4801,OM.(8),"Then, thus addressed, the holy man,"
4802,OM.(8),"The very glorious sage, began"
4803,OM.(8),The high preliminary rite.
4804,OM.(8),Restraining sense and appetite.
4805,OM.(8),"Calmly the youths that night reposed,"
4806,OM.(8),"And rose when morn her light disclosed,"
4807,OM.(8),"Their morning worship paid, and took"
4808,OM.(8),Of lustral water from the brook.
4809,OM.(8),"Thus purified they breathed the prayer,"

4832,OM.(8),"The saint his Dikshá(170) has begun,"

4834,OM.(8),Soon as the steadfast devotees
4835,OM.(8),"Had made reply in words like these,"
4836,OM.(8),"The youths began, disdaining sleep,"
4837,OM.(8),Six days and nights their watch to keep.

4839,OM.(8),"Unrivalled benders of the bow,"

4842,OM.(8),"'Twas now the sixth returning day,"
4843,OM.(8),The hour foretold had past away.
4844,OM.(8),"Then Ráma cried: ""O Lakshman, now"

4853,OM.(8),See! bursting from the altar came
4854,OM.(8),The sudden glory of the flame.
4855,OM.(8),"Round priest and deacon, and upon"
4856,OM.(8),"Grass, ladles, flowers, the splendour shone,"
4857,OM.(8),"And the high rite, in order due,"
4858,OM.(8),With sacred texts began anew.
4859,OM.(8),But then a loud and fearful roar
4860,OM.(8),Re-echoed through the sky;
4861,OM.(8),And like vast clouds that shadow o'er
4862,OM.(8),"The heavens in dark July,"
4863,OM.(8),Involved in gloom of magic might
4864,OM.(8),"Two fiends rushed on amain,"

4869,OM.(8),And Ráma saw those things of fear
4870,OM.(8),Impending overhead.
4871,OM.(8),Then soon as those accursed two
4872,OM.(8),"Who showered down blood be spied,"
4873,OM.(8),Thus to his brother brave and true
4874,OM.(8),Spoke Ráma lotus-eyed:
4875,OM.(8),"""Now, Lakshman, thou these fiends shalt see,"
4876,OM.(8),"Man-eaters, foul of mind,"
4877,OM.(8),Before my mortal weapon flee
4878,OM.(8),"Like clouds before the wind."""
4879,OM.(8),"He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,"
4880,OM.(8),"Upon his bow he pressed,"
4881,OM.(8),"And smote, to utmost fury wrought,"
4882,OM.(8),Márícha on the breast.
4883,OM.(8),Deep in his flesh the weapon lay
4884,OM.(8),"Winged by the mystic spell,"
4885,OM.(8),"And, hurled a hundred leagues away,"
4886,OM.(8),In ocean's flood he fell.
4887,OM.(8),"Then Ráma, when he saw the foe"
4888,OM.(8),Convulsed and mad with pain
4889,OM.(8),"Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,"
4890,OM.(8),To Lakshman spoke again:
4891,OM.(8),"""See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dart"
4892,OM.(8),"That strikes a numbing chill,"
4893,OM.(8),"Hath struck him senseless with the smart,"
4894,OM.(8),But left him breathing still.
4895,OM.(8),"But these who love the evil way,"
4896,OM.(8),"And drink the blood they spill,"
4897,OM.(8),"Rejoicing holy rites to stay,"
4898,OM.(8),"Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill."""
4899,OM.(8),"He seized another shaft, the best,"
4900,OM.(8),Aglow with living flame;
4901,OM.(8),"It struck Suváhu on the chest,"
4902,OM.(8),And dead to earth he came.
4903,OM.(8),"Again a dart, the Wind-God's own,"
4904,OM.(8),"Upon his string he laid,"
4905,OM.(8),"And all the demons were o'erthrown,"
4906,OM.(8),The saints no more afraid.
4907,OM.(8),"When thus the fiends were slain in fight,"
4908,OM.(8),"Disturbers of each holy rite,"

5108,OM.(8),On each fair maid a blast he sent:
5109,OM.(8),Each stately form he bowed and bent.
5110,OM.(8),Bent double by the Wind-God's ire
5111,OM.(8),"They sought the palace of their sire,"
5112,OM.(8),"There fell upon the ground with sighs,"
5113,OM.(8),While tears and shame were in their eyes.
5114,OM.(8),"The king himself, with troubled brow,"
5115,OM.(8),"Saw his dear girls so fair but now,"
5116,OM.(8),"A mournful sight all bent and bowed,"
5117,OM.(8),And grieving thus he cried aloud:
5118,OM.(8),"""What fate is this, and what the cause?"
5119,OM.(8),What wretch has scorned all heavenly laws?
5120,OM.(8),Who thus your forms could curve and break?
5121,OM.(8),"You struggle, but no answer make."""
5122,OM.(8),
5123,OM.(8),They heard the speech of that wise king

5126,OM.(8),"Touched with their heads his feet, and cried:"
5127,OM.(8),"""The God of Wind, pervading space,"
5128,OM.(8),"Would bring on us a foul disgrace,"
5129,OM.(8),And choosing folly's evil way
5130,OM.(8),From virtue's path in scorn would stray.
5131,OM.(8),But we in words like these reproved
5132,OM.(8),The God of Wind whom passion moved:
5133,OM.(8),"""Farewell, O Lord! A sire have we,"
5134,OM.(8),No women uncontrolled and free.
5135,OM.(8),"Go, and our sire's consent obtain"

5139,OM.(8),"But led by folly as a slave,"
5140,OM.(8),"He would not hear the rede we gave,"

5143,OM.(8),
5144,OM.(8),"The pious king, with grief distressed,"
5145,OM.(8),The noble hundred thus addressed:
5146,OM.(8),"""With patience, daughters, bear your fate,"
5147,OM.(8),Yours was a deed supremely great
5148,OM.(8),When with one mind you kept from shame
5149,OM.(8),The honour of your father's name.
5150,OM.(8),"Patience, when men their anger vent,"
5151,OM.(8),Is woman's praise and ornament;
5152,OM.(8),Yet when the Gods inflict the blow
5153,OM.(8),Hard is it to support the woe.
5154,OM.(8),"Patience, my girls, exceeds all price:"
5155,OM.(8),"'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice."

5177,OM.(8),"The child of Urmilá drew near,"

5189,OM.(8),Most eloquent she thus began:
5190,OM.(8),"""Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,"
5191,OM.(8),Close union with the Godhead gained.
5192,OM.(8),"I long, O Saint, to see a son"
5193,OM.(8),By force of holy penance won.

5195,OM.(8),"A son to me, thy suppliant, give."""
5196,OM.(8),"The saint with favour heard her prayer,"
5197,OM.(8),And gave a son exceeding fair.
5198,OM.(8),"Him, Chúli's spiritual child,"
5199,OM.(8),His mother Brahmadatta(175) styled.
5200,OM.(8),"King Brahmadatta, rich and great,"

5205,OM.(8),His hundred daughters' lord should be.
5206,OM.(8),"To him, obedient to his call,"
5207,OM.(8),The happy monarch gave them all.
5208,OM.(8),Like Indra then he took the hand
5209,OM.(8),Of every maiden of the band.
5210,OM.(8),Soon as the hand of each young maid
5211,OM.(8),"In Brahmadatta's palm was laid,"
5212,OM.(8),"Deformity and cares away,"
5213,OM.(8),She shone in beauty bright and gay.
5214,OM.(8),Their freedom from the Wind-God's might
5215,OM.(8),Saw Kusanábha with delight.

5246,OM.(8),"Time fled, and, as the saint foretold,"

5248,OM.(8),My sire was he; through him I trace
5249,OM.(8),My line from royal Kusa's race.
5250,OM.(8),My sister--elder-born was she--
5251,OM.(8),"The pure and good Satyavatí,(176)"
5252,OM.(8),Was to the great Richíka wed.
5253,OM.(8),"Still faithful to her husband dead,"
5254,OM.(8),"She followed him, most noble dame,"
5255,OM.(8),"And, raised to heaven in human frame,"
5256,OM.(8),A pure celestial stream became.
5257,OM.(8),"Down from Himálaya's snowy height,"
5258,OM.(8),"In floods for ever fair and bright,"

5260,OM.(8),To purify and glad the world.

5264,OM.(8),"Most loving to her husband found,"
5265,OM.(8),"High-fated, firm in each pure vow,"
5266,OM.(8),Is queen of all the rivers now.
5267,OM.(8),Bound by a vow I left her side
5268,OM.(8),And to the Perfect convent hied.
5269,OM.(8),"There, by the aid 'twas thine to lend,"
5270,OM.(8),"Made perfect, all my labours end."
5271,OM.(8),"Thus, mighty Prince, I now have told"

5278,OM.(8),Our journey of to-morrow stay.
5279,OM.(8),No leaf on any tree is stirred:
5280,OM.(8),Hushed in repose are beast and bird:
5281,OM.(8),"Where'er you turn, on every side,"
5282,OM.(8),"Dense shades of night the landscape hide,"
5283,OM.(8),"The light of eve is fled: the skies,"
5284,OM.(8),"Thick-studded with their host of eyes,"
5285,OM.(8),"Seem a star-forest overhead,"
5286,OM.(8),Where signs and constellations spread.
5287,OM.(8),"Now rises, with his pure cold ray,"
5288,OM.(8),"The moon that drives the shades away,"
5289,OM.(8),And with his gentle influence brings
5290,OM.(8),Joy to the hearts of living things.
5291,OM.(8),"Now, stealing from their lairs, appear"
5292,OM.(8),The beasts to whom the night is dear.
5293,OM.(8),"Now spirits walk, and every power"

5304,OM.(8),"And thy great name is sounded most,"

5326,OM.(8),On Sona's pleasant shore they passed.
5327,OM.(8),"Then, when the dawn began to break,"
5328,OM.(8),To Ráma thus the hermit spake:
5329,OM.(8),"""The light of dawn is breaking clear,"
5330,OM.(8),The hour of morning rites is near.
5331,OM.(8),"Rise, Ráma, rise, dear son, I pray,"

5334,OM.(8),"Then Ráma rose, and finished all"
5335,OM.(8),"His duties at the hermit's call,"
5336,OM.(8),"Prepared with joy the road to take,"
5337,OM.(8),And thus again in question spake:
5338,OM.(8),"""Here fair and deep the Sona flows,"
5339,OM.(8),And many an isle its bosom shows:
5340,OM.(8),"What way, O Saint, will lead us o'er"
5341,OM.(8),"And land us on the farther shore?"""
5342,OM.(8),"The saint replied: ""The way I choose"
5343,OM.(8),"Is that which pious hermits use."""
5344,OM.(8),For many a league they journeyed on
5345,OM.(8),"Till, when the sun of mid-day shone,"
5346,OM.(8),The hermit-haunted flood was seen
5347,OM.(8),"Of Jáhnaví,(177) the Rivers' Queen."
5348,OM.(8),"Soon as the holy stream they viewed,"
5349,OM.(8),Thronged with a white-winged multitude
5350,OM.(8),"Of sárases(178) and swans,(179) delight"
5351,OM.(8),Possessed them at the lovely sight;
5352,OM.(8),And then prepared the hermit band
5353,OM.(8),To halt upon that holy strand.
5354,OM.(8),"They bathed as Scripture bids, and paid"
5355,OM.(8),Oblations due to God and shade.
5356,OM.(8),"To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,"
5357,OM.(8),"And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet."
5358,OM.(8),Then pure and pleased they sate around
5359,OM.(8),Saint Visvámitra on the ground.
5360,OM.(8),"The holy men of lesser note,"
5361,OM.(8),"In due degree, sate more remote,"
5362,OM.(8),While Raghu's sons took nearer place
5363,OM.(8),By virtue of their rank and race.
5364,OM.(8),"Then Ráma said: ""O Saint, I yearn"
5365,OM.(8),"The three-pathed Gangá's tale to learn."""
5366,OM.(8),
5367,OM.(8),"Thus urged, the sage recounted both"
5368,OM.(8),The birth of Gangá and her growth:
5369,OM.(8),"""The mighty hill with metals stored,"
5370,OM.(8),"Himálaya, is the mountains' lord,"
5371,OM.(8),The father of a lovely pair
5372,OM.(8),Of daughters fairest of the fair:
5373,OM.(8),"Their mother, offspring of the will"
5374,OM.(8),"Of Meru, everlasting hill,"
5375,OM.(8),"Mená, Himálaya's darling, graced"
5376,OM.(8),With beauty of her dainty waist.
5377,OM.(8),Gangá was elder-born: then came
5378,OM.(8),The fair one known by Umá's name.
5379,OM.(8),"Then all the Gods of heaven, in need"
5380,OM.(8),"Of Gangá's help their vows to speed,"
5381,OM.(8),To great Himálaya came and prayed
5382,OM.(8),The mountain King to yield the maid.
5383,OM.(8),"He, not regardless of the weal"
5384,OM.(8),"Of the three worlds, with holy zeal"
5385,OM.(8),"His daughter to the Immortals gave,"
5386,OM.(8),"Gangá whose waters cleanse and save,"
5387,OM.(8),"Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,"
5388,OM.(8),"Purging all sinners, to the sea."
5389,OM.(8),"The three-pathed Gangá thus obtained,"
5390,OM.(8),The Gods their heavenly homes regained.
5391,OM.(8),Long time the sister Umá passed
5392,OM.(8),"In vows austere and rigid fast,"
5393,OM.(8),And the king gave the devotee
5394,OM.(8),"Immortal Rudra's(180) bride to be,"
5395,OM.(8),Matching with that unequalled Lord
5396,OM.(8),His Umá through the worlds adored.
5397,OM.(8),So now a glorious station fills
5398,OM.(8),Each daughter of the King of Hills:

5417,OM.(8),"Thus told his tale for Ráma's ear,"

5419,OM.(8),A legend to the prince began:
5420,OM.(8),"""There reigned a pious monarch o'er"
5421,OM.(8),Ayodhyá in the days of yore:
5422,OM.(8),"Sagar his name: no child had he,"
5423,OM.(8),And children much he longed to see.
5424,OM.(8),"His honoured consort, fair of face,"
5425,OM.(8),"Sprang from Vidarbha's royal race,"
5426,OM.(8),"Kesini, famed from early youth"
5427,OM.(8),For piety and love of truth.
5428,OM.(8),"Aríshtanemi's daughter fair,"
5429,OM.(8),With whom no maiden might compare
5430,OM.(8),"In beauty, though the earth is wide,"
5431,OM.(8),"Sumati, was his second bride."
5432,OM.(8),"With his two queens afar he went,"
5433,OM.(8),"And weary days in penance spent,"
5434,OM.(8),"Fervent, upon Himálaya's hill"
5435,OM.(8),Where springs the stream called Bhrigu' rill.
5436,OM.(8),Nor did he fail that saint to please
5437,OM.(8),With his devout austerities.
5438,OM.(8),"And, when a hundred years had fled,"
5439,OM.(8),Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said:
5440,OM.(8),"""From thee, O Sagar, blameless King,"
5441,OM.(8),"A mighty host of sons shall spring,"
5442,OM.(8),And thou shalt win a glorious name
5443,OM.(8),"Which none, O Chief, but thou shall claim."
5444,OM.(8),"One of thy queens a son shall bear,"
5445,OM.(8),Maintainer of thy race and heir;
5446,OM.(8),And of the other there shall be
5447,OM.(8),"Sons sixty thousand born to thee."""
5448,OM.(8),
5449,OM.(8),"Thus as he spake, with one accord,"
5450,OM.(8),"To win the grace of that high lord,"
5451,OM.(8),"The queens, with palms together laid,"
5452,OM.(8),In humble supplication prayed:
5453,OM.(8),"""Which queen, O Bráhman, of the pair,"
5454,OM.(8),"The many, or the one shall bear?"
5455,OM.(8),"Most eager, Lord, are we to know,"
5456,OM.(8),"And as thou sayest be it so."""
5457,OM.(8),With his sweet speech the saint replied:
5458,OM.(8),"""Yourselves, O Queens, the choice decide."
5459,OM.(8),Your own discretion freely use
5460,OM.(8),Which shall the one or many choose:
5461,OM.(8),"One shall the race and name uphold,"
5462,OM.(8),"The host be famous, strong, and bold."
5463,OM.(8),"Which will have which?"" Then Kesini"

5465,OM.(8),"Sumati, sister of the king(181)"
5466,OM.(8),"Of all the birds that ply the wing,"
5467,OM.(8),To that illustrious Bráhman sued
5468,OM.(8),That she might bear the multitude

5470,OM.(8),For mighty enterprise renowned.
5471,OM.(8),"Around the saint the monarch went,"

5475,OM.(8),Time passed. The elder consort bare
5476,OM.(8),"A son called Asamanj, the heir."

5529,OM.(8),A land the best for rites declared(183)--

5531,OM.(8),And Ansumán the prince--for so
5532,OM.(8),Sagar advised--with ready bow
5533,OM.(8),Was borne upon a mighty car
5534,OM.(8),To watch the steed who roamed afar.
5535,OM.(8),"But Indra, monarch of the skies,"
5536,OM.(8),"Veiling his form in demon guise,"
5537,OM.(8),Came down upon the appointed day
5538,OM.(8),And drove the victim horse away.
5539,OM.(8),"Reft of the steed the priests, distressed,"

5549,OM.(8),
5550,OM.(8),King Sagar in his crowded court
5551,OM.(8),Gave ear unto the priests' report.
5552,OM.(8),He summoned straightway to his side
5553,OM.(8),"His sixty thousand sons, and cried:"
5554,OM.(8),"""Brave sons of mine, I knew not how"
5555,OM.(8),These demons are so mighty now:
5556,OM.(8),The priests began the rite so well
5557,OM.(8),All sanctified with prayer and spell.
5558,OM.(8),"If in the depths of earth he hide,"
5559,OM.(8),"Or lurk beneath the ocean's tide,"
5560,OM.(8),"Pursue, dear sons, the robber's track;"
5561,OM.(8),Slay him and bring the charger back.
5562,OM.(8),"The whole of this broad earth explore,"
5563,OM.(8),"Sea-garlanded, from shore to shore:"
5564,OM.(8),"Yea, dig her up with might and main"
5565,OM.(8),Until you see the horse again.
5566,OM.(8),"Deep let your searching labour reach,"
5567,OM.(8),A league in depth dug out by each.
5568,OM.(8),"The robber of our horse pursue,"
5569,OM.(8),And please your sire who orders you.
5570,OM.(8),"My grandson, I, this priestly train,"
5571,OM.(8),"Till the steed comes, will here remain."""
5572,OM.(8),
5573,OM.(8),Their eager hearts with transport burned
5574,OM.(8),As to their task the heroes turned.
5575,OM.(8),"Obedient to their father, they"
5576,OM.(8),Through earth's recesses forced their way.
5577,OM.(8),With iron arms' unflinching toil
5578,OM.(8),Each dug a league beneath the soil.

5581,OM.(8),"Sharp-pointed coulter, pick, and bar,"

5585,OM.(8),"Giant and demon, fiend and snake,"
5586,OM.(8),That in earth's core their dwelling make.

5589,OM.(8),Cleaving the earth with matchless strength
5590,OM.(8),Till hell itself they reached at length.
5591,OM.(8),Thus digging searched they Jambudvip(184)

5601,OM.(8),"""The sons of Sagar, Sire benign,"

5603,OM.(8),And as their ruthless work they ply
5604,OM.(8),Innumerable creatures die.

5634,OM.(8),As Sagar's children pierced the ground.
5635,OM.(8),"When thus the whole broad earth was cleft,"
5636,OM.(8),"And not a spot unsearched was left,"
5637,OM.(8),"Back to their home the princes sped,"
5638,OM.(8),And thus unto their father said:
5639,OM.(8),"""We searched the earth from side to side,"
5640,OM.(8),While countless hosts of creatures died.
5641,OM.(8),Our conquering feet in triumph trod
5642,OM.(8),"On snake and demon, fiend and God;"

5650,OM.(8),"""Dig on, and ne'er your labour stay"
5651,OM.(8),Till through earth's depths you force your way.
5652,OM.(8),"Then smite the robber dead, and bring"

5657,OM.(8),"The immortal elephant they met,"
5658,OM.(8),"Famed Vírúpáksha(188) vast of size,"

5666,OM.(8),Around that warder strong and vast
5667,OM.(8),With reverential steps they passed.
5668,OM.(8),"Nor, when the honour due was paid,"
5669,OM.(8),Their downward search through earth delayed.
5670,OM.(8),But turning from the east aside
5671,OM.(8),Southward again their task they plied.
5672,OM.(8),"There Mahápadma held his place,"
5673,OM.(8),"The best of all his mighty race,"
5674,OM.(8),"Like some huge hill, of monstrous girth,"

5756,OM.(8),
5757,OM.(8),As to each warder beast he came

5814,OM.(8),"The rites performed, with brighter fame,"
5815,OM.(8),"Mighty in counsel, home he came."
5816,OM.(8),"He longed to bring the river down,"
5817,OM.(8),But found no plan his wish to crown.
5818,OM.(8),He pondered long with anxious thought
5819,OM.(8),But saw no way to what he sought.
5820,OM.(8),"Thus thirty thousand years he spent,"
5821,OM.(8),And then to heaven the monarch went.

5832,OM.(8),Prince Ansumán his throne to fill.
5833,OM.(8),"He ruled, a mighty king, unblamed,"
5834,OM.(8),Sire of Dilípa justly famed.
5835,OM.(8),"To him, his child and worthy heir,"
5836,OM.(8),"The king resigned his kingdom's care,"
5837,OM.(8),And on Himálaya's pleasant side
5838,OM.(8),His task austere of penance plied.
5839,OM.(8),Bright as a God in clear renown
5840,OM.(8),He planned to bring pure Gangá down.
5841,OM.(8),There on his fruitless hope intent
5842,OM.(8),"Twice sixteen thousand years he spent,"
5843,OM.(8),And in the grove of hermits stayed
5844,OM.(8),Till bliss in heaven his rites repaid.
5845,OM.(8),"Dilípa then, the good and great,"
5846,OM.(8),"Soon as he learnt his kinsmen's fate,"
5847,OM.(8),"Bowed down by woe, with troubled mind,"
5848,OM.(8),Pondering long no cure could find.
5849,OM.(8),"""How can I bring,"" the mourner sighed,"
5850,OM.(8),"""To cleanse their dust, the heavenly tide?"
5851,OM.(8),"How can I give them rest, and save"
5852,OM.(8),"Their spirits with the offered wave?"""
5853,OM.(8),Long with this thought his bosom skilled
5854,OM.(8),In holy discipline was filled.
5855,OM.(8),"A son was born, Bhagírath named,"
5856,OM.(8),Above all men for virtue famed.
5857,OM.(8),"Dilípa many a rite ordained,"

5859,OM.(8),But when no hope the king could see
5860,OM.(8),"His kinsmen from their woe to free,"
5861,OM.(8),"The lord of men, by sickness tried,"
5862,OM.(8),"Obeyed the law of fate, and died;"
5863,OM.(8),"He left the kingdom to his son,"
5864,OM.(8),And gained the heaven his deeds had won.
5865,OM.(8),"The good Bhagírath, royal sage,"
5866,OM.(8),Had no fair son to cheer his age.
5867,OM.(8),"He, great in glory, pure in will,"
5868,OM.(8),Longing for sons was childless still.
5869,OM.(8),"Then on one wish, one thought intent,"
5870,OM.(8),"Planning the heavenly stream's descent,"
5871,OM.(8),Leaving his ministers the care
5872,OM.(8),"And burden of his state to bear,"
5873,OM.(8),Dwelling in far Gokarna(194) he
5874,OM.(8),Engaged in long austerity.
5875,OM.(8),"With senses checked, with arms upraised,"
5876,OM.(8),Five fires(195) around and o'er him blazed.
5877,OM.(8),Each weary month the hermit passed
5878,OM.(8),Breaking but once his awful fast.
5879,OM.(8),"In winter's chill the brook his bed,"
5880,OM.(8),"In rain, the clouds to screen his head."
5881,OM.(8),Thousands of years he thus endured
5882,OM.(8),"Till Brahmá's favour was assured,"
5883,OM.(8),And the high Lord of living things
5884,OM.(8),Looked kindly on his sufferings.
5885,OM.(8),With trooping Gods the Sire came near
5886,OM.(8),The king who plied his task austere:
5887,OM.(8),"""Blest Monarch, of a glorious race,"
5888,OM.(8),Thy fervent rites have won my grace.
5889,OM.(8),Well hast thou wrought thine awful task:
5890,OM.(8),"Some boon in turn, O Hermit, ask."""
5891,OM.(8),
5892,OM.(8),"Bhagírath, rich in glory's light,"
5893,OM.(8),"The hero with the arm of might,"
5894,OM.(8),Thus to the Lord of earth and sky
5895,OM.(8),Raised suppliant hands and made reply:
5896,OM.(8),"""If the great God his favour deigns,"
5897,OM.(8),"And my long toil its fruit obtains,"
5898,OM.(8),Let Sagar's sons receive from me
5899,OM.(8),Libations that they long to see.
5900,OM.(8),Let Gangá with her holy wave
5901,OM.(8),"The ashes of the heroes lave,"
5902,OM.(8),That so my kinsmen may ascend
5903,OM.(8),To heavenly bliss that ne'er shall end.
5904,OM.(8),"And give, I pray, O God, a son,"
5905,OM.(8),Nor let my house be all undone.
5906,OM.(8),Sire of the worlds! be this the grace
5907,OM.(8),"Bestowed upon Ikshváku's race."""
5908,OM.(8),
5909,OM.(8),"The Sire, when thus the king had prayed,"
5910,OM.(8),In sweet kind words his answer made.
5911,OM.(8),"""High, high thy thought and wishes are,"
5912,OM.(8),Bhagírath of the mighty car!
5913,OM.(8),"Ikshváku's line is blest in thee,"
5914,OM.(8),And as thou prayest it shall be.
5915,OM.(8),"Gangá, whose waves in Swarga(196) flow,"
5916,OM.(8),Is daughter of the Lord of Snow.
5917,OM.(8),Win Siva that his aid be lent
5918,OM.(8),"To hold her in her mid descent,"
5919,OM.(8),For earth alone will never bear
5920,OM.(8),Those torrents hurled from upper air;
5921,OM.(8),"And none may hold her weight but He,"
5922,OM.(8),"The Trident wielding deity."""
5923,OM.(8),"Thus having said, the Lord supreme"
5924,OM.(8),Addressed him to the heavenly stream;
5925,OM.(8),And then with Gods and Maruts(197) went
5926,OM.(8),To heaven above the firmament.

5934,OM.(8),The Lord of life the skies regained:
5935,OM.(8),The fervent king a year remained
5936,OM.(8),"With arms upraised, refusing rest"
5937,OM.(8),"While with one toe the earth he pressed,"
5938,OM.(8),"Still as a post, with sleepless eye,"
5939,OM.(8),"The air his food, his roof the sky."
5940,OM.(8),"The year had past. Then Umá's lord,(198)"
5941,OM.(8),"King of creation, world adored,"
5942,OM.(8),"Thus spoke to great Bhagírath: ""I,"
5943,OM.(8),"Well pleased thy wish will gratify,"
5944,OM.(8),And on my head her waves shall fling
5945,OM.(8),"The daughter of the Mountains' King!"""
5946,OM.(8),
5947,OM.(8),He stood upon the lofty crest
5948,OM.(8),"That crowns the Lord of Snow,"
5949,OM.(8),And bade the river of the Blest
5950,OM.(8),Descend on earth below.
5951,OM.(8),"Himálaya's child, adored of all,"
5952,OM.(8),"The haughty mandate heard,"
5953,OM.(8),"And her proud bosom, at the call,"
5954,OM.(8),With furious wrath was stirred.
5955,OM.(8),Down from her channel in the skies
5956,OM.(8),With awful might she sped
5957,OM.(8),"With a giant's rush, in a giant's size,"
5958,OM.(8),On Siva's holy head.
5959,OM.(8),"""He calls me,"" in her wrath she cried,"
5960,OM.(8),"""And all my flood shall sweep"
5961,OM.(8),And whirl him in its whelming tide
5962,OM.(8),"To hell's profoundest deep."""
5963,OM.(8),"He held the river on his head,"
5964,OM.(8),"And kept her wandering, where,"
5965,OM.(8),"Dense as Himálaya's woods, were spread"
5966,OM.(8),The tangles of his hair.
5967,OM.(8),"No way to earth she found, ashamed,"
5968,OM.(8),"Though long and sore she strove,"
5969,OM.(8),"Condemned, until her pride were tamed,"
5970,OM.(8),Amid his locks to rove.
5971,OM.(8),"There, many lengthening seasons through,"
5972,OM.(8),The wildered river ran:
5973,OM.(8),"Bhagírath saw it, and anew"
5974,OM.(8),His penance dire began.
5975,OM.(8),"Then Siva, for the hermit's sake,"
5976,OM.(8),"Bade her long wanderings end,"
5977,OM.(8),And sinking into Vindu's lake
5978,OM.(8),Her weary waves descend.
5979,OM.(8),"From Gangá, by the God set free,"
5980,OM.(8),Seven noble rivers came;
5981,OM.(8),"Hládiní, Pávaní, and she"
5982,OM.(8),Called Naliní by name:
5983,OM.(8),These rolled their lucid waves along
5984,OM.(8),And sought the eastern side.
5985,OM.(8),"Suchakshu, Sítá fair and strong,"
5986,OM.(8),And Sindhu's mighty tide--(199)
5987,OM.(8),These to the region of the west
5988,OM.(8),With joyful waters sped:
5989,OM.(8),"The seventh, the brightest and the best,"
5990,OM.(8),Flowed where Bhagírath led.
5991,OM.(8),On Siva's head descending first
5992,OM.(8),A rest the torrents found:
5993,OM.(8),Then down in all their might they burst
5994,OM.(8),And roared along the ground.
5995,OM.(8),On countless glittering scales the beam
5996,OM.(8),"Of rosy morning flashed,"
5997,OM.(8),Where fish and dolphins through the stream
5998,OM.(8),Fallen and falling dashed.
5999,OM.(8),Then bards who chant celestial lays
6000,OM.(8),And nymphs of heavenly birth
6001,OM.(8),Flocked round upon that flood to gaze
6002,OM.(8),That streamed from sky to earth.
6003,OM.(8),"The Gods themselves from every sphere,"
6004,OM.(8),"Incomparably bright,"
6005,OM.(8),Borne in their golden cars drew near
6006,OM.(8),To see the wondrous sight.
6007,OM.(8),The cloudless sky was all aflame
6008,OM.(8),With the light of a hundred suns
6009,OM.(8),Where'er the shining chariots came
6010,OM.(8),That bore those holy ones.
6011,OM.(8),So flashed the air with crested snakes
6012,OM.(8),And fish of every hue
6013,OM.(8),As when the lightning's glory breaks
6014,OM.(8),Through fields of summer blue.
6015,OM.(8),And white foam-clouds and silver spray
6016,OM.(8),"Were wildly tossed on high,"
6017,OM.(8),Like swans that urge their homeward way
6018,OM.(8),Across the autumn sky.
6019,OM.(8),Now ran the river calm and clear
6020,OM.(8),With current strong and deep:
6021,OM.(8),"Now slowly broadened to a mere,"
6022,OM.(8),Or scarcely seemed to creep.
6023,OM.(8),Now o'er a length of sandy plain
6024,OM.(8),Her tranquil course she held;
6025,OM.(8),"Now rose her waves and sank again,"
6026,OM.(8),By refluent waves repelled.
6027,OM.(8),"So falling first on Siva's head,"
6028,OM.(8),"Thence rushing to their earthly bed,"
6029,OM.(8),"In ceaseless fall the waters streamed,"
6030,OM.(8),And pure with holy lustre gleamed.
6031,OM.(8),"Then every spirit, sage, and bard,"
6032,OM.(8),"Condemned to earth by sentence hard,"
6033,OM.(8),Pressed eagerly around the tide
6034,OM.(8),That Siva's touch had sanctified.
6035,OM.(8),"Then they whom heavenly doom had hurled,"
6036,OM.(8),"Accursed, to this lower world,"
6037,OM.(8),"Touched the pure wave, and freed from sin"
6038,OM.(8),Resought the skies and entered in.
6039,OM.(8),"And all the world was glad, whereon"
6040,OM.(8),"The glorious water flowed and shone,"
6041,OM.(8),For sin and stain were banished thence
6042,OM.(8),By the sweet river's influence.
6043,OM.(8),"First, in a car of heavenly frame,"
6044,OM.(8),"The royal saint of deathless name,"
6045,OM.(8),"Bhagírath, very glorious rode,"
6046,OM.(8),And after him fair Gangá flowed.
6047,OM.(8),"God, sage, and bard, the chief in place"
6048,OM.(8),"Of spirits and the Nága race,"
6049,OM.(8),"Nymph, giant, fiend, in long array"
6050,OM.(8),Sped where Bhagírath led the way;
6051,OM.(8),And all the hosts the flood that swim
6052,OM.(8),Followed the stream that followed him.
6053,OM.(8),"Where'er the great Bhagírath led,"
6054,OM.(8),"There ever glorious Gangá fled,"
6055,OM.(8),"The best of floods, the rivers' queen,"
6056,OM.(8),Whose waters wash the wicked clean.
6057,OM.(8),
6058,OM.(8),"It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,"
6059,OM.(8),Engaged with holy offerings stood;
6060,OM.(8),The river spread her waves around
6061,OM.(8),Flooding his sacrificial ground.
6062,OM.(8),"The saint in anger marked her pride,"
6063,OM.(8),And at one draught her stream he dried.
6064,OM.(8),"Then God, and sage, and bard, afraid,"
6065,OM.(8),"To noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,"
6066,OM.(8),And begged that he would kindly deem
6067,OM.(8),His own dear child that holy stream.
6068,OM.(8),"Moved by their suit, he soothed their fears"
6069,OM.(8),And loosed her waters from his ears.
6070,OM.(8),Hence Gangá through the world is styled
6071,OM.(8),Both Jáhnavi and Jahnu's child.
6072,OM.(8),"Then onward still she followed fast,"
6073,OM.(8),And reached the great sea bank at last.
6074,OM.(8),Thence deep below her way she made
6075,OM.(8),To end those rites so long delayed.
6076,OM.(8),"The monarch reached the Ocean's side,"
6077,OM.(8),And still behind him Gangá hied.
6078,OM.(8),He sought the depths which open lay
6079,OM.(8),Where Sagar's sons had dug their way.
6080,OM.(8),So leading through earth's nether caves
6081,OM.(8),"The river's purifying waves,"
6082,OM.(8),Over his kinsmen's dust the lord
6083,OM.(8),His funeral libation poured.
6084,OM.(8),"Soon as the flood their dust bedewed,"
6085,OM.(8),"Their spirits gained beatitude,"
6086,OM.(8),And all in heavenly bodies dressed
6087,OM.(8),Rose to the skies' eternal rest.
6088,OM.(8),
6089,OM.(8),Then thus to King Bhagírath said
6090,OM.(8),"Brahmá, when, coming at the head"
6091,OM.(8),"Of all his bright celestial train,"
6092,OM.(8),He saw those spirits freed from stain:
6093,OM.(8),"""Well done! great Prince of men, well done!"
6094,OM.(8),Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.
6095,OM.(8),"The sons of Sagar mighty-souled,"
6096,OM.(8),"Are with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,"
6097,OM.(8),Long as the Ocean's flood shall stand
6098,OM.(8),"Upon the border of the land,"
6099,OM.(8),"So long shall Sagar's sons remain,"
6100,OM.(8),"And, godlike, rank in heaven retain."
6101,OM.(8),"Gangá thine eldest child shall be,"
6102,OM.(8),Called from thy name Bhágirathí;
6103,OM.(8),Named also--for her waters fell
6104,OM.(8),From heaven and flow through earth and hell--
6105,OM.(8),"Tripathagá, stream of the skies,"
6106,OM.(8),Because three paths she glorifies.
6107,OM.(8),"And, mighty King, 'tis given thee now"
6108,OM.(8),To free thee and perform thy vow.
6109,OM.(8),"No longer, happy Prince, delay"
6110,OM.(8),Drink-offerings to thy kin to pay.
6111,OM.(8),"For this the holiest Sagar sighed,"
6112,OM.(8),But mourned the boon he sought denied.
6113,OM.(8),"Then Ansumán, dear Prince! although"
6114,OM.(8),"No brighter name the world could show,"
6115,OM.(8),Strove long the heavenly flood to gain
6116,OM.(8),"To visit earth, but strove in vain."
6117,OM.(8),"Nor was she by the sages' peer,"
6118,OM.(8),"Blest with all virtues, most austere,"
6119,OM.(8),"Thy sire Dilípa, hither brought,"
6120,OM.(8),Though with fierce prayers the boon he sought.
6121,OM.(8),"But thou, O King, earned success,"
6122,OM.(8),And won high fame which God will bless.
6123,OM.(8),"Through thee, O victor of thy foes,"
6124,OM.(8),"On earth this heavenly Gangá flows,"
6125,OM.(8),And thou hast gained the meed divine
6126,OM.(8),That waits on virtue such as thine.
6127,OM.(8),Now in her ever holy wave
6128,OM.(8),"Thyself, O best of heroes, lave:"
6129,OM.(8),"So shalt thou, pure from every sin,"
6130,OM.(8),The blessed fruit of merit win.
6131,OM.(8),Now for thy kin who died of yore
6132,OM.(8),The meet libations duly pour.
6133,OM.(8),Above the heavens I now ascend:
6134,OM.(8),"Depart, and bliss thy steps attend."""
6135,OM.(8),
6136,OM.(8),Thus to the mighty king who broke
6137,OM.(8),"His foemens' might, Lord Brahmá spoke,"
6138,OM.(8),And with his Gods around him rose
6139,OM.(8),To his own heaven of blest repose.
6140,OM.(8),"The royal sage no more delayed,"
6141,OM.(8),"But, the libation duly paid,"
6142,OM.(8),Home to his regal city hied
6143,OM.(8),With water cleansed and purified.
6144,OM.(8),"There ruled he his ancestral state,"
6145,OM.(8),"Best of all men, most fortunate."
6146,OM.(8),And all the people joyed again
6147,OM.(8),In good Bhagírath's gentle reign.
6148,OM.(8),"Rich, prosperous, and blest were they,"
6149,OM.(8),And grief and sickness fled away.
6150,OM.(8),"Thus, Ráma, I at length have told"
6151,OM.(8),How Gangá came from heaven of old.
6152,OM.(8),"Now, for the evening passes swift,"
6153,OM.(8),I wish thee each auspicious gift.
6154,OM.(8),This story of the flood's descent
6155,OM.(8),Will give--for 'tis most excellent--

6171,OM.(8),From realms above descending she
6172,OM.(8),Flowed through the land and filled the sea.
6173,OM.(8),In thinking o'er what thou hast said
6174,OM.(8),"The night has like a moment fled,"
6175,OM.(8),Whose hours in musing have been spent
6176,OM.(8),Upon thy words most excellent:

6179,OM.(8),
6180,OM.(8),Day dawned. The morning rites were done

6182,OM.(8),"Addressed the sage in words like these,"
6183,OM.(8),Rich in his long austerities:
6184,OM.(8),"""The night is past: the morn is clear;"
6185,OM.(8),Told is the tale so good to hear:
6186,OM.(8),"Now o'er that river let us go,"
6187,OM.(8),"Three-pathed, the best of all that flow."
6188,OM.(8),This boat stands ready on the shore

6195,OM.(8),"Placed in the boat the hermit band,"
6196,OM.(8),And reached the river's further strand.
6197,OM.(8),"On the north bank their feet they set,"
6198,OM.(8),And greeted all the saints they met.
6199,OM.(8),"On Gangá's shore they lighted down,"
6200,OM.(8),And saw Visálá's lovely town.
6201,OM.(8),"Thither, the princes by his side,"
6202,OM.(8),The best of holy hermits hied.
6203,OM.(8),It was a town exceeding fair

6214,OM.(8),"The tale of Indra's wondrous deed,"
6215,OM.(8),And mark me as I truly tell
6216,OM.(8),What here in ancient days befell.
6217,OM.(8),"Ere Krita's famous Age(200) had fled,"
6218,OM.(8),Strong were the sons of Diti(201) bred;
6219,OM.(8),And Aditi's brave children too
6220,OM.(8),"Were very mighty, good, and true."
6221,OM.(8),The rival brothers fierce and bold
6222,OM.(8),Were sons of Kasyap lofty-souled.
6223,OM.(8),"Of sister mothers born, they vied,"
6224,OM.(8),"Brood against brood, in jealous pride."
6225,OM.(8),"Once, as they say, band met with band,"
6226,OM.(8),"And, joined in awful council, planned"
6227,OM.(8),"To live, unharmed by age and time,"
6228,OM.(8),Immortal in their youthful prime.
6229,OM.(8),"Then this was, after due debate,"
6230,OM.(8),"The counsel of the wise and great,"
6231,OM.(8),To churn with might the milky sea(202)
6232,OM.(8),The life-bestowing drink to free.
6233,OM.(8),"This planned, they seized the Serpent King,"
6234,OM.(8),"Vásuki, for their churning-string,"
6235,OM.(8),"And Mandar's mountain for their pole,"
6236,OM.(8),And churned with all their heart and soul.
6237,OM.(8),"As thus, a thousand seasons through,"
6238,OM.(8),"This way and that the snake they drew,"
6239,OM.(8),"Biting the rocks, each tortured head,"
6240,OM.(8),A very deadly venom shed.
6241,OM.(8),"Thence, bursting like a mighty flame,"
6242,OM.(8),"A pestilential poison came,"
6243,OM.(8),"Consuming, as it onward ran,"
6244,OM.(8),"The home of God, and fiend, and man."
6245,OM.(8),Then all the suppliant Gods in fear
6246,OM.(8),"To Sankar,(203) mighty lord, drew near."
6247,OM.(8),"To Rudra, King of Herds, dismayed,"
6248,OM.(8),"""Save us, O save us, Lord!"" they prayed."
6249,OM.(8),"Then Vishnu, bearing shell, and mace,"
6250,OM.(8),"And discus, showed his radiant face,"
6251,OM.(8),And thus addressed in smiling glee
6252,OM.(8),The Trident wielding deity:
6253,OM.(8),"""What treasure first the Gods upturn"
6254,OM.(8),"From troubled Ocean, as they churn,"
6255,OM.(8),Should--for thou art the eldest--be
6256,OM.(8),"Conferred, O best of Gods, on thee."
6257,OM.(8),"Then come, and for thy birthright's sake,"
6258,OM.(8),"This venom as thy first fruits take."""
6259,OM.(8),"He spoke, and vanished from their sight,"
6260,OM.(8),"When Siva saw their wild affright,"
6261,OM.(8),And heard his speech by whom is borne
6262,OM.(8),"The mighty bow of bending horn,(204)"
6263,OM.(8),The poisoned flood at once he quaffed
6264,OM.(8),As 'twere the Amrit's heavenly draught.
6265,OM.(8),Then from the Gods departing went
6266,OM.(8),"Siva, the Lord pre-eminent."
6267,OM.(8),The host of Gods and Asurs still
6268,OM.(8),Kept churning with one heart and will.
6269,OM.(8),"But Mandar's mountain, whirling round,"
6270,OM.(8),Pierced to the depths below the ground.
6271,OM.(8),Then Gods and bards in terror flew
6272,OM.(8),To him who mighty Madhu slew.
6273,OM.(8),"""Help of all beings! more than all,"
6274,OM.(8),The Gods on thee for aid may call.
6275,OM.(8),"Ward off, O mighty-armed! our fate,"
6276,OM.(8),"And bear up Mandar's threatening weight."""
6277,OM.(8),"Then Vishnu, as their need was sore,"
6278,OM.(8),"The semblance of a tortoise wore,"
6279,OM.(8),And in the bed of Ocean lay
6280,OM.(8),The mountain on his back to stay.
6281,OM.(8),"Then he, the soul pervading all,"
6282,OM.(8),"Whose locks in radiant tresses fall,"
6283,OM.(8),"One mighty arm extended still,"
6284,OM.(8),And grasped the summit of the hill.
6285,OM.(8),"So ranged among the Immortals, he"
6286,OM.(8),Joined in the churning of the sea.
6287,OM.(8),
6288,OM.(8),"A thousand years had reached their close,"
6289,OM.(8),When calmly from the ocean rose
6290,OM.(8),"The gentle sage(205) with staff and can,"
6291,OM.(8),Lord of the art of healing man.
6292,OM.(8),"Then as the waters foamed and boiled,"
6293,OM.(8),"As churning still the Immortals toiled,"
6294,OM.(8),"Of winning face and lovely frame,"
6295,OM.(8),Forth sixty million fair ones came.
6296,OM.(8),"Born of the foam and water, these"
6297,OM.(8),Were aptly named Apsarases.(206)
6298,OM.(8),Each had her maids. The tongue would fail--
6299,OM.(8),So vast the throng--to count the tale.
6300,OM.(8),But when no God or Titan wooed
6301,OM.(8),"A wife from all that multitude,"
6302,OM.(8),"Refused by all, they gave their love"
6303,OM.(8),In common to the Gods above.
6304,OM.(8),Then from the sea still vext and wild
6305,OM.(8),"Rose Surá,(207) Varun's maiden child."
6306,OM.(8),A fitting match she sought to find:
6307,OM.(8),"But Diti's sons her love declined,"
6308,OM.(8),Their kinsmen of the rival brood
6309,OM.(8),To the pure maid in honour sued.
6310,OM.(8),Hence those who loved that nymph so fair
6311,OM.(8),The hallowed name of Suras bear.
6312,OM.(8),And Asurs are the Titan crowd
6313,OM.(8),Her gentle claims who disallowed.
6314,OM.(8),Then from the foamy sea was freed
6315,OM.(8),"Uchchaihsravas,(208) the generous steed,"
6316,OM.(8),"And Kaustubha, of gems the gem,(209)"
6317,OM.(8),"And Soma, Moon God, after them."
6318,OM.(8),
6319,OM.(8),"At length when many a year had fled,"
6320,OM.(8),"Up floated, on her lotus bed,"
6321,OM.(8),"A maiden fair and tender-eyed,"
6322,OM.(8),In the young flush of beauty's pride.
6323,OM.(8),"She shone with pearl and golden sheen,"
6324,OM.(8),"And seals of glory stamped her queen,"
6325,OM.(8),"On each round arm glowed many a gem,"
6326,OM.(8),"On her smooth brows, a diadem."
6327,OM.(8),Rolling in waves beneath her crown
6328,OM.(8),"The glory of her hair flowed down,"
6329,OM.(8),"Pearls on her neck of price untold,"
6330,OM.(8),The lady shone like burnisht gold.
6331,OM.(8),"Queen of the Gods, she leapt to land,"
6332,OM.(8),"A lotus in her perfect hand,"
6333,OM.(8),"And fondly, of the lotus-sprung,"
6334,OM.(8),To lotus-bearing Vishnu clung.
6335,OM.(8),Her Gods above and men below
6336,OM.(8),As Beauty's Queen and Fortune know.(210)
6337,OM.(8),"Gods, Titans, and the minstrel train"
6338,OM.(8),Still churned and wrought the troubled main.
6339,OM.(8),"At length the prize so madly sought,"
6340,OM.(8),"The Amrit, to their sight was brought."
6341,OM.(8),"For the rich spoil, 'twixt these and those"
6342,OM.(8),"A fratricidal war arose,"
6343,OM.(8),"And, host 'gainst host in battle, set,"
6344,OM.(8),Aditi's sons and Diti's met.
6345,OM.(8),"United, with the giants' aid,"
6346,OM.(8),"Their fierce attack the Titans made,"
6347,OM.(8),And wildly raged for many a day
6348,OM.(8),That universe-astounding fray.
6349,OM.(8),"When wearied arms were faint to strike,"
6350,OM.(8),"And ruin threatened all alike,"
6351,OM.(8),"Vishnu, with art's illusive aid,"
6352,OM.(8),The Amrit from their sight conveyed.
6353,OM.(8),That Best of Beings smote his foes
6354,OM.(8),Who dared his deathless arm oppose:
6355,OM.(8),"Yea, Vishnu, all-pervading God,"
6356,OM.(8),Beneath his feet the Titans trod
6357,OM.(8),"Aditi's race, the sons of light,"
6358,OM.(8),slew Diti's brood in cruel fight.
6359,OM.(8),Then town-destroying(211) Indra gained
6360,OM.(8),"His empire, and in glory reigned"
6361,OM.(8),O'er the three worlds with bard and sage
6362,OM.(8),Rejoicing in his heritage.

6370,OM.(8),"But Diti, when her sons were slain,"
6371,OM.(8),"Wild with a childless mother's pain,"
6372,OM.(8),"To Kasyap spake, Marícha's son,"
6373,OM.(8),"Her husband: ""O thou glorious one!"
6374,OM.(8),"Dead are the children, mine no more,"
6375,OM.(8),The mighty sons to thee I bore.
6376,OM.(8),"Long fervour's meed, I crave a boy"
6377,OM.(8),Whose arm may Indra's life destroy.
6378,OM.(8),The toil and pain my care shall be:
6379,OM.(8),To bless my hope depends on thee.
6380,OM.(8),Give me a mighty son to slay
6381,OM.(8),"Fierce Indra, gracious lord! I pray."""
6382,OM.(8),
6383,OM.(8),Then glorious Kasyap thus replied
6384,OM.(8),"To Diti, as she wept and sighed:"
6385,OM.(8),"""Thy prayer is heard, dear saint! Remain"
6386,OM.(8),"Pure from all spot, and thou shalt gain"
6387,OM.(8),A son whose arm shall take the life
6388,OM.(8),Of Indra in the battle strife.
6389,OM.(8),For full a thousand years endure
6390,OM.(8),"Free from all stain, supremely pure;"
6391,OM.(8),"Then shall thy son and mine appear,"
6392,OM.(8),"Whom the three worlds shall serve with fear."""
6393,OM.(8),"These words the glorious Kasyap said,"
6394,OM.(8),"Then gently stroked his consort's head,"
6395,OM.(8),"Blessed her, and bade a kind adieu,"
6396,OM.(8),And turned him to his rites anew.
6397,OM.(8),"Soon as her lord had left her side,"
6398,OM.(8),Her bosom swelled with joy and pride.
6399,OM.(8),"She sought the shade of holy boughs,"
6400,OM.(8),And there began her awful vows.
6401,OM.(8),"While yet she wrought her rites austere,"
6402,OM.(8),"Indra, unbidden, hastened near,"
6403,OM.(8),"With sweet observance tending her,"
6404,OM.(8),A reverential minister.
6405,OM.(8),"Wood, water, fire, and grass he brought,"
6406,OM.(8),"Sweet roots and woodland fruit he sought,"
6407,OM.(8),"And all her wants, the Thousand-eyed,"
6408,OM.(8),"With never-failing care, supplied,"
6409,OM.(8),With tender love and soft caress
6410,OM.(8),Removing pain and weariness.
6411,OM.(8),
6412,OM.(8),"When, of the thousand years ordained,"
6413,OM.(8),"Ten only unfulfilled remained,"
6414,OM.(8),"Thus to her son, the Thousand-eyed,"
6415,OM.(8),The Goddess in her triumph cried:
6416,OM.(8),"""Best of the mighty! there remain"
6417,OM.(8),But ten short years of toil and pain;
6418,OM.(8),"These years of penance soon will flee,"
6419,OM.(8),And a new brother thou shalt see.
6420,OM.(8),"Him for thy sake I'll nobly breed,"

6435,OM.(8),"""No fault, O Lord of Gods, is thine;"

6545,OM.(8),When Janak's lovely city first
6546,OM.(8),"Upon their sight, yet distant, burst,"
6547,OM.(8),The hermits all with joyful cries

6570,OM.(8),And saw the beauty of the dame.
6571,OM.(8),"The sage's form the God endued,"

6591,OM.(8),"And grass, the best of eremites."
6592,OM.(8),The Lord of Gods was sad of cheer

6637,OM.(8),"Within the grove, with Lakshman, hied,"

6639,OM.(8),To that illustrious penitent.
6640,OM.(8),"He saw the glorious lady, screened"
6641,OM.(8),"From eye of man, and God, and fiend,"
6642,OM.(8),Like some bright portent which the care
6643,OM.(8),"Of Brahmá launches through the air,"
6644,OM.(8),Designed by his illusive art
6645,OM.(8),To flash a moment and depart:
6646,OM.(8),Or like the flame that leaps on high
6647,OM.(8),To sink involved in smoke and die:
6648,OM.(8),Or like the full moon shining through
6649,OM.(8),"The wintry mist, then lost to view:"

6655,OM.(8),Prince Ráma came to set her free.
6656,OM.(8),
6657,OM.(8),"Then, with great joy that dame to meet,"
6658,OM.(8),The sons of Raghu clapped her feet;
6659,OM.(8),"And she, remembering Gautam's oath,"
6660,OM.(8),With gentle grace received them both;

6714,OM.(8),
6715,OM.(8),"Then Janak, best of kings, aware"
6716,OM.(8),"Of Visvámitra lodging there,"
6717,OM.(8),With Satánanda for his guide--
6718,OM.(8),"The priest on whom he most relied,"

6731,OM.(8),"Then, with his palms together laid,"

6773,OM.(8),"Thus spoke the monarch, lofty-souled,"

6775,OM.(8),"How, sons of Dasaratha, they"
6776,OM.(8),"Accompanied his homeward way,"
6777,OM.(8),"How in the hermitage they dwelt,"
6778,OM.(8),And slaughter to the demons dealt:
6779,OM.(8),Their journey till the spot they neared
6780,OM.(8),Whence fair Visálá's towers appeared:
6781,OM.(8),Ahalyá seen and freed from taint;
6782,OM.(8),Their meeting with her lord the saint;
6783,OM.(8),"And how they thither came, to know"

6785,OM.(8),
6786,OM.(8),Thus Visvámitra spoke the whole

6799,OM.(8),"Great Satánanda, far-renowned,"
6800,OM.(8),Whom long austerities had crowned
6801,OM.(8),With glory--as the news he heard
6802,OM.(8),"The down upon his body stirred,--"
6803,OM.(8),Filled full of wonder at the sight
6804,OM.(8),"Of Ráma, felt supreme delight."
6805,OM.(8),When Satánanda saw the pair
6806,OM.(8),"Of youthful princes seated there,"
6807,OM.(8),He turned him to the holy man
6808,OM.(8),"Who sate at ease, and thus began:"
6809,OM.(8),"""And didst thou, mighty Sage, in truth"
6810,OM.(8),Show clearly to this royal youth
6811,OM.(8),"My mother, glorious far and wide,"
6812,OM.(8),Whom penance-rites have sanctified?
6813,OM.(8),"And did my glorious mother--she,"

6815,OM.(8),"Serve her great guest with woodland store,"
6816,OM.(8),Whom all should honour evermore?
6817,OM.(8),Didst thou the tale to Ráma tell
6818,OM.(8),"Of what in ancient days befell,"
6819,OM.(8),"The sin, the misery, and the shame"
6820,OM.(8),Of guilty God and faithless dame?
6821,OM.(8),"And, O thou best of hermits, say,"
6822,OM.(8),Did Ráma's healing presence stay
6823,OM.(8),Her trial? was the wife restored
6824,OM.(8),"Again to him, my sire and lord?"
6825,OM.(8),"Say, Hermit, did that sire of mine"
6826,OM.(8),"Receive her with a soul benign,"
6827,OM.(8),When long austerities in time
6828,OM.(8),Had cleansed her from the taint of crime?
6829,OM.(8),"And, son of Kusik, let me know,"
6830,OM.(8),Did my great-minded father show
6831,OM.(8),"Honour to Ráma, and regard,"
6832,OM.(8),"Before he journeyed hitherward?"""
6833,OM.(8),The hermit with attentive ear
6834,OM.(8),Marked all the questions of the seer:
6835,OM.(8),"To him for eloquence far-famed,"
6836,OM.(8),His eloquent reply he framed:
6837,OM.(8),"""Yea, 'twas my care no task to shun,"
6838,OM.(8),And all I had to do was done;

6842,OM.(8),"When the great sage had thus replied,"

6844,OM.(8),"""A welcome visit, Prince, is thine,"
6845,OM.(8),Thou scion of King Raghu's line.
6846,OM.(8),"With him to guide thy way aright,"
6847,OM.(8),"This sage invincible in might,"
6848,OM.(8),"This Bráhman sage, most glorious-bright,"
6849,OM.(8),By long austerities has wrought
6850,OM.(8),"A wondrous deed, exceeding thought:"
6851,OM.(8),"Thou knowest well, O strong of arm,"
6852,OM.(8),This sure defence from scathe and harm.
6853,OM.(8),"None, Ráma, none is living now"
6854,OM.(8),"In all the earth more blest than thou,"
6855,OM.(8),That thou hast won a saint so tried
6856,OM.(8),In fervid rites thy life to guide.
6857,OM.(8),"Now listen, Prince, while I relate"
6858,OM.(8),His lofty deeds and wondrous fate.
6859,OM.(8),He was a monarch pious-souled.

6871,OM.(8),Governed the land with kingly care.
6872,OM.(8),While years unnumbered rolled away
6873,OM.(8),The monarch reigned with equal sway.
6874,OM.(8),"At length, assembling many a band,"
6875,OM.(8),He led his warriors round the land--
6876,OM.(8),"Complete in tale, a mighty force,"
6877,OM.(8),"Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse."
6878,OM.(8),"Through cities, groves, and floods he passed,"
6879,OM.(8),"O'er lofty hills, through regions vast."
6880,OM.(8),"He reached Vasishtha's pure abode,"
6881,OM.(8),"Where trees, and flowers, and creepers glowed,"

6883,OM.(8),Which saints and angels visited.

6886,OM.(8),"The deer their timid ways forgot,"
6887,OM.(8),And holy Bráhmans thronged the spot.
6888,OM.(8),"Bright in their souls, like fire, were these,"
6889,OM.(8),"Made pure by long austerities,"
6890,OM.(8),"Bound by the rule of vows severe,"
6891,OM.(8),And each in glory Brahmá's peer.
6892,OM.(8),"Some fed on water, some on air,"
6893,OM.(8),Some on the leaves that withered there.
6894,OM.(8),Roots and wild fruit were others' food;

6898,OM.(8),"These, and ascetic bands beside,"
6899,OM.(8),The sweet retirement beautified.
6900,OM.(8),"Such was Vasishtha's blest retreat,"

6916,OM.(8),"The king was welcomed in, and shown"

6926,OM.(8),"That fire, and vows, and pupils throve,"
6927,OM.(8),And all the trees within the grove.
6928,OM.(8),"And then the son of Brahmá, best"
6929,OM.(8),"Of all who pray with voice suppressed,"
6930,OM.(8),Questioned with pleasant words like these
6931,OM.(8),The mighty king who sate at ease:
6932,OM.(8),"""And is it well with thee? I pray;"
6933,OM.(8),And dost thou win by virtuous sway
6934,OM.(8),"Thy people's love, discharging all"
6935,OM.(8),The duties on a king that fall?
6936,OM.(8),Are all thy servants fostered well?
6937,OM.(8),"Do all obey, and none rebel?"
6938,OM.(8),"Hast thou, destroyer of the foe,"
6939,OM.(8),No enemies to overthrow?
6940,OM.(8),"Does fortune, conqueror! still attend"
6941,OM.(8),"Thy treasure, host, and every friend?"
6942,OM.(8),Is it all well? Does happy fate
6943,OM.(8),"On sons and children's children wait?"""
6944,OM.(8),
6945,OM.(8),He spoke. The modest king replied
6946,OM.(8),That all was prosperous far and wide.
6947,OM.(8),
6948,OM.(8),"Thus for awhile the two conversed,"
6949,OM.(8),"As each to each his tale rehearsed,"
6950,OM.(8),"And as the happy moments flew,"
6951,OM.(8),Their joy and friendship stronger grew.
6952,OM.(8),"When such discourse had reached an end,"
6953,OM.(8),Thus spoke the saint most reverend
6954,OM.(8),"To royal Visvámitra, while"
6955,OM.(8),His features brightened with a smile:
6956,OM.(8),"""O mighty lord of men. I fain"
6957,OM.(8),Would banquet thee and all thy train
6958,OM.(8),In mode that suits thy station high:
6959,OM.(8),And do not thou my prayer deny.
6960,OM.(8),Let my good lord with favour take
6961,OM.(8),"The offering that I fain would make,"
6962,OM.(8),"And let me honour, ere we part,"
6963,OM.(8),"My royal guest with loving heart."""
6964,OM.(8),
6965,OM.(8),Him Visvámitra thus addressed:
6966,OM.(8),"""Why make, O Saint, this new request?"
6967,OM.(8),Thy welcome and each gracious word
6968,OM.(8),Sufficient honour have conferred.
6969,OM.(8),"Thou gavest roots and fruit to eat,"
6970,OM.(8),"The treasures of this pure retreat,"
6971,OM.(8),And water for my mouth and feet;
6972,OM.(8),And--boon I prize above the rest--
6973,OM.(8),Thy presence has mine eyesight blest.
6974,OM.(8),"Honoured by thee in every way,"
6975,OM.(8),"To whom all honour all should pay,"

7047,OM.(8),"To Visvámitra answer made,"
7048,OM.(8),The king whom all the land obeyed:
7049,OM.(8),"""Not for a hundred thousand,--nay,"
7050,OM.(8),"Not if ten million thou wouldst pay,"
7051,OM.(8),"With silver heaps the price to swell,--"
7052,OM.(8),"Will I my cow, O Monarch, sell."
7053,OM.(8),Unmeet for her is such a fate.
7054,OM.(8),That I my friend should alienate.
7055,OM.(8),"As glory with the virtuous, she"
7056,OM.(8),For ever makes her home with me.
7057,OM.(8),On her mine offerings which ascend
7058,OM.(8),To Gods and spirits all depend:

7067,OM.(8),"The banquet which thy host has shared,"
7068,OM.(8),"Believe it, was by her prepared,"
7069,OM.(8),"In her mine only treasures lie,"
7070,OM.(8),She cheers mine heart and charms mine eye.
7071,OM.(8),And reasons more could I assign
7072,OM.(8),"Why Dapple-skin can ne'er be thine."""
7073,OM.(8),
7074,OM.(8),"The royal sage, his suit denied,"
7075,OM.(8),With eloquence more earnest cried:
7076,OM.(8),"""Tusked elephants, a goodly train,"
7077,OM.(8),"Each with a golden girth and chain,"
7078,OM.(8),Whose goads with gold well fashioned shine--
7079,OM.(8),Of these be twice seven thousand thine.
7080,OM.(8),"And four-horse cars with gold made bright,"
7081,OM.(8),"With steeds most beautifully white,"
7082,OM.(8),"Whose bells make music as they go,"
7083,OM.(8),"Eight hundred, Saint, will I bestow."
7084,OM.(8),Eleven thousand mettled steeds
7085,OM.(8),"From famous lands, of noble breeds--"
7086,OM.(8),"These will I gladly give, O thou"
7087,OM.(8),Devoted to each holy vow.
7088,OM.(8),"Ten million heifers, fair to view,"
7089,OM.(8),Whose sides are marked with every hue--
7090,OM.(8),These in exchange will I assign;

7096,OM.(8),
7097,OM.(8),"The great Vasishtha, thus addressed,"
7098,OM.(8),Made answer to the king's request:

7100,OM.(8),"My gem, my wealth, my life and stay."
7101,OM.(8),"My worship at the moon's first show,"

7104,OM.(8),Which largess due and gifts await.
7105,OM.(8),"From her alone, their root, O King,"
7106,OM.(8),My rites and holy service spring.

7119,OM.(8),"The monarch, as a last resource,"
7120,OM.(8),Began to drag her off by force.
7121,OM.(8),While the king's servants tore away
7122,OM.(8),"Their moaning, miserable prey,"
7123,OM.(8),"Sad, sick at heart, and sore distressed,"
7124,OM.(8),She pondered thus within her breast:
7125,OM.(8),"""Why am I thus forsaken? why"
7126,OM.(8),Betrayed by him of soul most high.
7127,OM.(8),"Vasishtha, ravished by the hands"
7128,OM.(8),Of soldiers of the monarch's bands?
7129,OM.(8),Ah me! what evil have I done
7130,OM.(8),"Against the lofty-minded one,"

7132,OM.(8),"The innocent whose love he knows?"""
7133,OM.(8),"In her sad breast as thus she thought,"
7134,OM.(8),"And heaved deep sighs with anguish fraught,"
7135,OM.(8),"With wondrous speed away she fled,"
7136,OM.(8),And back to Saint Vasishtha sped.
7137,OM.(8),She hurled by hundreds to the ground
7138,OM.(8),"The menial crew that hemmed her round,"
7139,OM.(8),And flying swifter than the blast
7140,OM.(8),Before the saint herself she cast.
7141,OM.(8),There Dapple-skin before the saint
7142,OM.(8),"Stood moaning forth her sad complaint,"
7143,OM.(8),And wept and lowed: such tones as come
7144,OM.(8),From wandering cloud or distant drum.
7145,OM.(8),"""O son of Brahmá,"" thus cried she,"

7149,OM.(8),
7150,OM.(8),Then thus the Bráhman saint replied
7151,OM.(8),"To her whose heart with woe was tried,"
7152,OM.(8),"And grieving for his favourite's sake,"
7153,OM.(8),As to a suffering sister spake:
7154,OM.(8),"""I leave thee not: dismiss the thought;"
7155,OM.(8),"Nor, duteous, hast thou failed in aught."
7156,OM.(8),"This king, o'erweening in the pride"
7157,OM.(8),"Of power, has reft thee from my side."
7158,OM.(8),"Little, I ween, my strength could do"
7159,OM.(8),"'Gainst him, a mighty warrior too."
7160,OM.(8),"Strong, as a soldier born and bred,--"

7164,OM.(8),O'er countless bands his pennons fly;
7165,OM.(8),"So is he mightier far than I."""
7166,OM.(8),"He spoke. Then she, in lowly mood,"
7167,OM.(8),To that high saint her speech renewed:
7168,OM.(8),"""So judge not they who wisest are:"
7169,OM.(8),The Bráhman's might is mightier far.
7170,OM.(8),"For Bráhmans strength from Heaven derive,"
7171,OM.(8),And warriors bow when Bráhmans strive.
7172,OM.(8),A boundless power 'tis thine to wield:
7173,OM.(8),"To such a king thou shouldst not yield,"
7174,OM.(8),"Who, very mighty though he be,--"
7175,OM.(8),"So fierce thy strength,--must bow to thee."
7176,OM.(8),"Command me, Saint. Thy power divine"
7177,OM.(8),Has brought me here and made me thine;

7186,OM.(8),Before the very leader's view.
7187,OM.(8),"The monarch in excessive ire,"
7188,OM.(8),"His eyes with fury darting fire,"
7189,OM.(8),Rained every missile on the foe
7190,OM.(8),Till all the Pahlavas were low.

7192,OM.(8),Lying by thousands on the plain.
7193,OM.(8),"Created, by her mere desire,"
7194,OM.(8),"Yavans and Sakas, fierce and dire."
7195,OM.(8),And all the ground was overspread
7196,OM.(8),With Yavans and with Sakas dread:
7197,OM.(8),"A host of warriors bright and strong,"
7198,OM.(8),And numberless in closest throng:

7206,OM.(8),"The monarch, famous through the world"

7234,OM.(8),"Fell in a moment's time, subdued"
7235,OM.(8),By that tremendous multitude.
7236,OM.(8),"The monarch's hundred sons, whose eyes"
7237,OM.(8),"Beheld the rout in wild surprise,"
7238,OM.(8),"Armed with all weapons, mad with rage,"
7239,OM.(8),Rushed fiercely on the holy sage.
7240,OM.(8),"One cry he raised, one glance he shot,"

7248,OM.(8),Or as in swift eclipse the Sun
7249,OM.(8),Dark with the doom he cannot shun:
7250,OM.(8),Or a poor bird with mangled wing--
7251,OM.(8),"So, reft of sons and host, the king"
7252,OM.(8),"No longer, by ambition fired,"
7253,OM.(8),The pride of war his breast inspired.
7254,OM.(8),He gave his empire to his son--
7255,OM.(8),"Of all he had, the only one:"
7256,OM.(8),And bade him rule as kings are taught
7257,OM.(8),Then straight a hermit-grove he sought.
7258,OM.(8),"Far to Himálaya's side he fled,"
7259,OM.(8),"Which bards and Nágas visited,"
7260,OM.(8),"And, Mahádeva's(231) grace to earn,"

7268,OM.(8),What brings thee here? what boon to gain?

7292,OM.(8),Already in his mind he viewed
7293,OM.(8),Vasishtha at his feet subdued.
7294,OM.(8),"He sought that hermit's grove, and there"
7295,OM.(8),"Launched his dire weapons through the air,"

7297,OM.(8),The hermitage in ashes lay.

7307,OM.(8),"A solitary wild was made,"

7348,OM.(8),
7349,OM.(8),Then Gádhi's son in fury threw
7350,OM.(8),Lord Varun's arm and Rudra's too:

7362,OM.(8),"Pináka, and twin bolts that glow"
7363,OM.(8),"With fury as they flash and fly,"

7377,OM.(8),These fearful darts in fiery rain
7378,OM.(8),"He hurled upon the saint amain,"

7453,OM.(8),"""Thou by the penance, Kusik's son,"
7454,OM.(8),A place 'mid royal saints hast won.
7455,OM.(8),"Pleased with thy constant penance, we"

7457,OM.(8),
7458,OM.(8),Thus spoke the glorious Lord most High
7459,OM.(8),"Father of earth and air and sky,"
7460,OM.(8),And with the Gods around him spread
7461,OM.(8),Home to his changeless sphere he sped.
7462,OM.(8),"But Visvámitra scorned the grace,"
7463,OM.(8),And bent in shame his angry face.
7464,OM.(8),"Burning with rage, o'erwhelmed with grief,"
7465,OM.(8),Thus in his heart exclaimed the chief:
7466,OM.(8),"""No fruit, I ween, have I secured"
7467,OM.(8),"By strictest penance long endured,"
7468,OM.(8),If Gods and all the saints decree

7480,OM.(8),"His priest Vasishtha's aid he sought,"

7482,OM.(8),But wise Vasishtha showed the hope
7483,OM.(8),Was far beyond the monarch's scope.
7484,OM.(8),"Trisanku then, his suit denied,"
7485,OM.(8),"Far to the southern region hied,"
7486,OM.(8),To beg Vasishtha's sons to aid
7487,OM.(8),The mighty plan his soul had made.
7488,OM.(8),"There King Trisanku, far renowned,"

7499,OM.(8),Succour of you who aid the weak.
7500,OM.(8),"A mighty offering I would pay,"
7501,OM.(8),"But sage Vasishtha answered, Nay."
7502,OM.(8),"Be yours permission to accord,"
7503,OM.(8),And to my rites your help afford.
7504,OM.(8),"Sons of my guide, to each of you"
7505,OM.(8),With lowly reverence here I sue;

7511,OM.(8),And dwell with Gods within the skies.

7560,OM.(8),That night Trisanku underwent
7561,OM.(8),Sad change in shape and lineament.

7760,OM.(8),"Some time in sacrifice had past,"

7799,OM.(8),"And marked him falling from the sky,"
7800,OM.(8),"And giving all his passion sway,"
7801,OM.(8),"Cried out in fury, ""Stay, O stay!"""
7802,OM.(8),"By penance-power and holy lore,"
7803,OM.(8),"Like Him who framed the worlds of yore,"
7804,OM.(8),Seven other saints he fixed on high

7808,OM.(8),New wreathed stars prepared to set
7809,OM.(8),In many a sparkling coronet.
7810,OM.(8),"He threatened, blind with rage and hate,"

7817,OM.(8),"Confused with terror, sick and faint,"
7818,OM.(8),"To high souled Visvámitra hied,"

7828,OM.(8),The changeless purpose of his breast:
7829,OM.(8),"""Content ye, Gods: I soothly sware"
7830,OM.(8),Trisanku to the skies to bear
7831,OM.(8),"Clothed in his body, nor can I"

7833,OM.(8),Embodied let the king ascend
7834,OM.(8),To life in heaven that ne'er shall end.
7835,OM.(8),And let these new-made stars of mine
7836,OM.(8),Firm and secure for ever shine.

7864,OM.(8),Before the dwellers of the shade:
7865,OM.(8),"""The southern land where now we are"
7866,OM.(8),Offers this check our rites to bar:(240)
7867,OM.(8),"To other regions let us speed,"
7868,OM.(8),And ply our tasks from trouble freed.
7869,OM.(8),Now turn we to the distant west.
7870,OM.(8),"To Pushkar's(241) wood where hermits rest,"
7871,OM.(8),"And there to rites austere apply,"
7872,OM.(8),"For not a grove with that can vie."""

7874,OM.(8),"The saint, in glory's light arrayed,"
7875,OM.(8),"In Pushkar's wood his dwelling made,"
7876,OM.(8),And living there on roots and fruit
7877,OM.(8),Did penance stern and resolute.

7880,OM.(8),"By Ambarísha's name far known,"
7881,OM.(8),"At that same time, it chanced, began"
7882,OM.(8),A sacrificial rite to plan.
7883,OM.(8),But Indra took by force away
7884,OM.(8),The charger that the king would slay.
7885,OM.(8),"The victim lost, the Bráhman sped"
7886,OM.(8),"To Ambarísha's side, and said:"
7887,OM.(8),"""Gone is the steed, O King, and this"
7888,OM.(8),"Is due to thee, in care remiss."
7889,OM.(8),Such heedless faults will kings destroy
7890,OM.(8),Who fail to guard what they enjoy.
7891,OM.(8),The flaw is desperate: we need
7892,OM.(8),"The charger, or a man to bleed."
7893,OM.(8),"Quick! bring a man if not the horse,"
7894,OM.(8),"That so the rite may have its course."""
7895,OM.(8),
7896,OM.(8),The glory of Ikshváku's line
7897,OM.(8),"Made offer of a thousand kine,"
7898,OM.(8),And sought to buy at lordly price
7899,OM.(8),A victim for the sacrifice.
7900,OM.(8),"To many a distant land he drove,"
7901,OM.(8),"To many a people, town, and grove,"
7902,OM.(8),"And holy shades where hermits rest,"
7903,OM.(8),Pursuing still his eager quest.
7904,OM.(8),At length on Bhrigu's sacred height
7905,OM.(8),The saint Richíka met his sight
7906,OM.(8),Sitting beneath the holy boughs.

7909,OM.(8),"The mighty lord drew near, assayed"

7912,OM.(8),The Bráhman saint with this request:
7913,OM.(8),"""Bought with a hundred thousand kine,"
7914,OM.(8),"Give me, O Sage, a son of thine"
7915,OM.(8),"To be a victim in the rite,"
7916,OM.(8),And thanks the favour shall requite.
7917,OM.(8),"For I have roamed all countries round,"
7918,OM.(8),Nor sacrificial victim found.
7919,OM.(8),"Then, gentle Hermit, deign to spare"
7920,OM.(8),"One child amid the number there."""
7921,OM.(8),
7922,OM.(8),Then to the monarch's speech replied
7923,OM.(8),"The hermit, penance-glorified:"
7924,OM.(8),"""For countless kine, for hills of gold,"
7925,OM.(8),"Mine eldest son shall ne'er be sold."""
7926,OM.(8),"But, when she heard the saint's reply,"
7927,OM.(8),"The children's mother, standing nigh,"
7928,OM.(8),Words such as these in answer said
7929,OM.(8),"To Ambarísha, monarch dread:"

7946,OM.(8),"The son is sold who comes between."""
7947,OM.(8),"The king with joy his home resought,"
7948,OM.(8),And took the prize his kine had bought.
7949,OM.(8),"He bade the youth his car ascend,"

7959,OM.(8),His weary steeds at length he stayed
7960,OM.(8),At height of noon their rest to take
7961,OM.(8),Upon the bank of Pushkar's lake.
7962,OM.(8),There while the king enjoyed repose
7963,OM.(8),"The captive Sunahsepha rose,"
7964,OM.(8),And hasting to the water's side
7965,OM.(8),"His uncle Visvámitra spied,"
7966,OM.(8),With many a hermit 'neath the trees
7967,OM.(8),Engaged in stern austerities.

7969,OM.(8),"Distracted with the toil and thirst,"
7970,OM.(8),"With woeful mien, away he burst,"

7977,OM.(8),"O thou to whom the wretched flee,"
7978,OM.(8),"And find a saviour, Saint, in thee,"
7979,OM.(8),"Now let the king obtain his will,"
7980,OM.(8),"And me my length of days fulfil,"
7981,OM.(8),"That rites austere I too may share,"
7982,OM.(8),May rise to heaven and rest me there.
7983,OM.(8),With tender soul and gentle brow
7984,OM.(8),"Be guardian of the orphan thou,"

7986,OM.(8),"Preserve me from my fear and woe."""
7987,OM.(8),
7988,OM.(8),"When Visvámitra, glorious saint,"
7989,OM.(8),Had heard the boy's heart-rending plaint.
7990,OM.(8),"He soothed his grief, his tears he dried,"
7991,OM.(8),"Then called his sons to him, and cried:"
7992,OM.(8),"""The time is come for you to show"
7993,OM.(8),The duty and the aid bestow
7994,OM.(8),"For which, regarding future life,"
7995,OM.(8),A man gives children to his wife.
7996,OM.(8),"This hermit's son, whom here you see"
7997,OM.(8),"A suppliant, refuge seeks with me."
7998,OM.(8),"O sons, the friendless youth befriend,"
7999,OM.(8),"And, pleasing me, his life defend."

8001,OM.(8),True to the virtuous life I taught.
8002,OM.(8),"Go, and as victims doomed to bleed,"
8003,OM.(8),"Die, and Lord Agni's hunger feed."
8004,OM.(8),"So shall the rite completed end,"
8005,OM.(8),"This orphan gain a saving friend,"
8006,OM.(8),"Due offerings to the Gods be paid,"
8007,OM.(8),"And your own father's voice obeyed."""
8008,OM.(8),
8009,OM.(8),Then Madhushyand and all the rest
8010,OM.(8),Answered their sire with scorn and jest:
8011,OM.(8),"""What! aid to others' sons afford,"
8012,OM.(8),"And leave thine own to die, my lord!"
8013,OM.(8),"To us it seems a horrid deed,"
8014,OM.(8),"As 'twere on one's own flesh to feed."""
8015,OM.(8),
8016,OM.(8),"The hermit heard his sons' reply,"
8017,OM.(8),And burning rage inflamed his eye.
8018,OM.(8),Then forth his words of fury burst:
8019,OM.(8),"""Audacious speech, by virtue cursed!"
8020,OM.(8),It lifts on end each shuddering hair--
8021,OM.(8),My charge to scorn! my wrath to dare!
8022,OM.(8),"You, like Vasishtha's evil brood,"
8023,OM.(8),Shall make the flesh of dogs your food

8026,OM.(8),
8027,OM.(8),Thus on his sons his curse he laid.
8028,OM.(8),"Then calmed again that youth dismayed,"
8029,OM.(8),And blessed him with his saving aid:
8030,OM.(8),"""When in the sacred fetters bound,"
8031,OM.(8),"And with a purple garland crowned,"
8032,OM.(8),"At Vishnu's post thou standest tied,"
8033,OM.(8),With lauds be Agni glorified.
8034,OM.(8),And these two hymns of holy praise
8035,OM.(8),"Forget not, Hermit's son, to raise"
8036,OM.(8),"In the king's rite, and thou shalt be"
8037,OM.(8),"Lord of thy wish, preserved, and free."""
8038,OM.(8),
8039,OM.(8),"He learnt the hymns with mind intent,"
8040,OM.(8),And from the hermit's presence went.
8041,OM.(8),To Ambarísha thus he spake:
8042,OM.(8),"""Let us our onward journey take."
8043,OM.(8),"Haste to thy home, O King, nor stay"

8045,OM.(8),
8046,OM.(8),"The boy's address the monarch cheered,"
8047,OM.(8),And soon the sacred ground he neared.
8048,OM.(8),The convocation's high decree
8049,OM.(8),Declared the youth from blemish free;
8050,OM.(8),Clothed in red raiment he was tied
8051,OM.(8),A victim at the pillar's side.
8052,OM.(8),"There bound, the Fire-God's hymn he raised,"
8053,OM.(8),And Indra and Upendra praised.
8054,OM.(8),"Thousand-eyed Vishnu, pleased to hear"
8055,OM.(8),"The mystic laud, inclined his ear,"
8056,OM.(8),"And won by worship, swift to save,"
8057,OM.(8),Long life to Sunahsepha gave.
8058,OM.(8),The king in bounteous measure gained
8059,OM.(8),"The fruit of sacrifice ordained,"
8060,OM.(8),"By grace of Him who rules the skies,"
8061,OM.(8),Lord Indra of the thousand eyes.
8062,OM.(8),
8063,OM.(8),And Visvámitra evermore.
8064,OM.(8),Pursued his task on Pushkar's shore
8065,OM.(8),Until a thousand years had past

8071,OM.(8),Canto LXIII. Menaká.
8072,OM.(8),
8073,OM.(8),
8074,OM.(8),A thousand years had thus flown by
8075,OM.(8),"When all the Gods within the sky,"
8076,OM.(8),Eager that he the fruit might gain
8077,OM.(8),"Of fervent rite and holy pain,"
8078,OM.(8),"Approached the great ascetic, now"
8079,OM.(8),Bathed after toil and ended vow.
8080,OM.(8),Then Brahmá speaking for the rest
8081,OM.(8),With sweetest words the sage addressed:
8082,OM.(8),"""Hail, Saint! This high and holy name"
8083,OM.(8),"Thy rites have won, thy merits claim."""
8084,OM.(8),
8085,OM.(8),"Thus spoke the Lord whom Gods revere,"
8086,OM.(8),And sought again his heavenly sphere.
8087,OM.(8),"But Visvámitra, more intent,"
8088,OM.(8),His mind to sterner penance bent.
8089,OM.(8),"So many a season rolled away,"
8090,OM.(8),"When Menaká, fair nymph, one day"
8091,OM.(8),Came down from Paradise to lave
8092,OM.(8),"Her perfect limbs in Pushkar's wave,"
8093,OM.(8),The glorious son of Kusik saw
8094,OM.(8),That peerless shape without a flaw
8095,OM.(8),Flash through the flood's translucent shroud
8096,OM.(8),Like lightning gleaming through a cloud.
8097,OM.(8),"He saw her in that lone retreat,"
8098,OM.(8),"Most beautiful from head to feet,"
8099,OM.(8),And by Kandarpa's(243) might subdued
8100,OM.(8),He thus addressed her as he viewed:
8101,OM.(8),"""Welcome, sweet nymph! O deign, I pray,"
8102,OM.(8),In these calm shades awhile to stay.
8103,OM.(8),"To me some gracious favour show,"
8104,OM.(8),"For love has set my breast aglow."""
8105,OM.(8),
8106,OM.(8),He spoke. The fairest of the fair
8107,OM.(8),"Made for awhile her dwelling there,"
8108,OM.(8),While day by day the wild delight
8109,OM.(8),Stayed vow austere and fervent rite
8110,OM.(8),There as the winsome charmer wove
8111,OM.(8),"Her spells around him in the grove,"
8112,OM.(8),"And bound him in a golden chain,"
8113,OM.(8),"Five sweet years fled, and five again."
8114,OM.(8),"Then Visvámitra woke to shame,"
8115,OM.(8),"And, fraught with anguish, memory came"
8116,OM.(8),"For quick he knew, with anger fired,"
8117,OM.(8),That all the Immortals had conspired
8118,OM.(8),"To lap his careless soul in ease,"
8119,OM.(8),And mar his long austerities.
8120,OM.(8),"""Ten years have past, each day and night"
8121,OM.(8),Unheeded in delusive flight.
8122,OM.(8),"So long my fervent rites were stayed,"
8123,OM.(8),"While thus I lay by love betrayed."""
8124,OM.(8),"As thus long sighs the hermit heaved,"
8125,OM.(8),"And, touched with deep repentance, grieved,"
8126,OM.(8),He saw the fair one standing nigh
8127,OM.(8),With suppliant hands and trembling eye.
8128,OM.(8),"With gentle words he bade her go,"
8129,OM.(8),Then sought the northern hills of snow.
8130,OM.(8),With firm resolve he vowed to beat
8131,OM.(8),The might of love beneath his feet.
8132,OM.(8),Still northward to the distant side
8133,OM.(8),"Of Kausikí(244), the hermit hide,"
8134,OM.(8),And gave his life to penance there
8135,OM.(8),With rites austere most hard to bear.
8136,OM.(8),"A thousand years went by, and still"
8137,OM.(8),He laboured on the northern hill
8138,OM.(8),With pains so terrible and drear
8139,OM.(8),"That all the Gods were chilled with fear,"
8140,OM.(8),"And Gods and saints, for swift advice,"
8141,OM.(8),Met in the halls of Paradise.
8142,OM.(8),"""Let Kusik's son,"" they counselled, ""be"

8146,OM.(8),To him enriched by rites severe
8147,OM.(8),He spoke in accents sweet to hear:
8148,OM.(8),"""Hail, Mighty Saint! dear son, all hail!"
8149,OM.(8),"Thy fervour wins, thy toils prevail."
8150,OM.(8),Won by thy vows and zeal intense
8151,OM.(8),"I give this high preëminence."""
8152,OM.(8),"He to the General Sire replied,"
8153,OM.(8),"Not sad, nor wholly satisfied:"
8154,OM.(8),"""When thou, O Brahmá, shalt declare"
8155,OM.(8),"The title, great beyond compare,"
8156,OM.(8),"Of Bráhman saint my worthy meed,"

8165,OM.(8),"Began his labours to renew,"
8166,OM.(8),Which sterner yet and fiercer grew.
8167,OM.(8),"His arms upraised, without a rest,"
8168,OM.(8),With but one foot the earth he pressed;
8169,OM.(8),"The air his food, the hermit stood"
8170,OM.(8),Still as a pillar hewn from wood.
8171,OM.(8),Around him in the summer days
8172,OM.(8),Five mighty fires combined to blaze.
8173,OM.(8),In floods of rain no veil was spread
8174,OM.(8),"Save clouds, to canopy his head."
8175,OM.(8),In the dank dews both night and day
8176,OM.(8),Couched in the stream the hermit lay.
8177,OM.(8),"Thus, till a thousand years had fled,"
8178,OM.(8),He plied his task of penance dread.
8179,OM.(8),Then Vishnu and the Gods with awe
8180,OM.(8),"The labours of the hermit saw,"
8181,OM.(8),"And Sakra, in his troubled breast,"
8182,OM.(8),"Lord of the skies, his fear confessed."
8183,OM.(8),And brooded on a plan to spoil
8184,OM.(8),The merits of the hermit's toil.
8185,OM.(8),Encompassed by his Gods of Storm
8186,OM.(8),"He summoned Rambhá, fair of form,"

8203,OM.(8),Is very fierce and swift to rage.
8204,OM.(8),"I doubt not, he so dread and stern"

8225,OM.(8),The sweet note of that tuneful bird
8226,OM.(8),"The saint with ravished bosom heard,"
8227,OM.(8),And on his heart a rapture passed

8229,OM.(8),But when he heard the bird prolong
8230,OM.(8),"His sweet incomparable song,"
8231,OM.(8),"And saw the nymph with winning smile,"
8232,OM.(8),The hermit's heart perceived the wile.
8233,OM.(8),And straight he knew the Thousand-eyed
8234,OM.(8),A plot against his peace had tried.
8235,OM.(8),Then Kusik's son indignant laid
8236,OM.(8),His curse upon the heavenly maid:

8244,OM.(8),"Thou from my curse shalt then escape."""
8245,OM.(8),"But when the saint had cursed her so,"
8246,OM.(8),"His breast was burnt with fires of woe,"
8247,OM.(8),Grieved that long effort to restrain
8248,OM.(8),His mighty wrath was all in vain.
8249,OM.(8),"Cursed by the angry sage's power,"
8250,OM.(8),She stood in stone that selfsame hour.

8276,OM.(8),"Then from Himálaya's heights of snow,"
8277,OM.(8),"The glorious saint prepared to go,"
8278,OM.(8),And dwelling in the distant east
8279,OM.(8),His penance and his toil increased.
8280,OM.(8),A thousand years his lips he held
8281,OM.(8),"Closed by a vow unparalleled,"
8282,OM.(8),"And other marvels passing thought,"
8283,OM.(8),"Unrivalled in the world, he wrought."
8284,OM.(8),In all the thousand years his frame
8285,OM.(8),Dry as a log of wood became.
8286,OM.(8),"By many a cross and check beset,"
8287,OM.(8),Rage had not stormed his bosom yet.
8288,OM.(8),With iron will that naught could bend
8289,OM.(8),He plied his labour till the end.
8290,OM.(8),"So when the weary years were o'er,"
8291,OM.(8),"Freed from his vow so stern and sore,"
8292,OM.(8),"The hermit, all his penance sped,"
8293,OM.(8),Sate down to eat his meal of bread.
8294,OM.(8),"Then Indra, clad in Bráhman guise,"
8295,OM.(8),Asked him for food with hungry eyes.
8296,OM.(8),"The mighty saint, with steadfast soul,"
8297,OM.(8),"To the false Bráhman gave the whole,"
8298,OM.(8),"And when no scrap for him remained,"
8299,OM.(8),"Fasting and faint, from speech refrained."
8300,OM.(8),His silent vow he would not break:
8301,OM.(8),"No breath he heaved, no word he spake,"
8302,OM.(8),"Then as he checked his breath, behold!"
8303,OM.(8),Around his brow thick smoke-clouds rolled
8304,OM.(8),"And the three worlds, as if o'erspread"
8305,OM.(8),"With ravening flames, were filled with dread."
8306,OM.(8),"Then God and saint and bard, convened,"
8307,OM.(8),"And Nága lord, and snake, and fiend,"
8308,OM.(8),"Thus to the General Father cried,"
8309,OM.(8),"Distracted, sad, and terrified:"
8310,OM.(8),"""Against the hermit, sore assailed,"
8311,OM.(8),"Lure, scathe, and scorn have naught availed,"
8312,OM.(8),Proof against rage and treacherous art
8313,OM.(8),He keeps his vow with constant heart.
8314,OM.(8),Now if his toils assist him naught
8315,OM.(8),"To gain the boon his soul has sought,"
8316,OM.(8),He through the worlds will ruin send
8317,OM.(8),"That fixt and moving things shall end,"
8318,OM.(8),"The regions now are dark with doom,"
8319,OM.(8),No friendly ray relieves the gloom.
8320,OM.(8),"Each ocean foams with maddened tide,"
8321,OM.(8),The shrinking hills in fear subside.
8322,OM.(8),Trembles the earth with feverous throe
8323,OM.(8),The wind in fitful tempest blows.
8324,OM.(8),No cure we see with troubled eyes:
8325,OM.(8),And atheist brood on earth may rise.
8326,OM.(8),"The triple world is wild with care,"
8327,OM.(8),Or spiritless in dull despair.
8328,OM.(8),"Before that saint the sun is dim,"
8329,OM.(8),His blessed light eclipsed by him.
8330,OM.(8),Now ere the saint resolve to bring
8331,OM.(8),"Destruction on each living thing,"
8332,OM.(8),"Let us appease, while yet we may,"
8333,OM.(8),"Him bright as fire, like fire to slay."
8334,OM.(8),"Yea, as the fiery flood of Fate"
8335,OM.(8),"Lays all creation desolate,"
8336,OM.(8),He o'er the conquered Gods may reign:
8337,OM.(8),"O, grant him what he longs to gain."""
8338,OM.(8),
8339,OM.(8),"Then all the Blest, by Brahmá led,"
8340,OM.(8),Approached the saint and sweetly said:
8341,OM.(8),"""Hail, Bráhman Saint! for such thy place:"
8342,OM.(8),Thy vows austere have won our grace.
8343,OM.(8),A Bráhman's rank thy penance stern
8344,OM.(8),And ceaseless labour richly earn.
8345,OM.(8),I with the Gods of Storm decree
8346,OM.(8),"Long life, O Bráhman Saint, to thee."
8347,OM.(8),May peace and joy thy soul possess:
8348,OM.(8),"Go where thou wilt in happiness."""
8349,OM.(8),
8350,OM.(8),"Thus by the General Sire addressed,"
8351,OM.(8),Joy and high triumph filled his breast.
8352,OM.(8),"His head in adoration bowed,"
8353,OM.(8),Thus spoke he to the Immortal crowd:
8354,OM.(8),"""If I, ye Gods, have gained at last"
8355,OM.(8),"Both length of days and Bráhman caste,"
8356,OM.(8),"Grant that the high mysterious name,"
8357,OM.(8),"And holy Vedas, own my claim,"
8358,OM.(8),And that the formula to bless
8359,OM.(8),"The sacrifice, its lord confess."
8360,OM.(8),"And let Vasishtha, who excels"
8361,OM.(8),"In Warriors' art and mystic spells,"
8362,OM.(8),"In love of God without a peer,"
8363,OM.(8),"Confirm the boon you promise here."""
8364,OM.(8),
8365,OM.(8),"With Brahmá's son Vasishtha, best"
8366,OM.(8),"Of those who pray with voice repressed,"
8367,OM.(8),"The Gods by earnest prayer prevailed,"
8368,OM.(8),And thus his new-made friend he hailed:
8369,OM.(8),"""Thy title now is sure and good"
8370,OM.(8),"To rights of saintly Bráhmanhood."""
8371,OM.(8),"Thus spake the sage. The Gods, content,"
8372,OM.(8),Back to their heavenly mansions went.
8373,OM.(8),"And Visvámitra, pious-souled,"
8374,OM.(8),"Among the Bráhman saints enrolled,"
8375,OM.(8),On reverend Vasishtha pressed
8376,OM.(8),The honours due to holy guest.
8377,OM.(8),"Successful in his high pursuit,"
8378,OM.(8),"The sage, in penance resolute,"
8379,OM.(8),Walked in his pilgrim wanderings o'er
8380,OM.(8),The whole broad land from shore to shore.
8381,OM.(8),"'Twas thus the saint, O Raghu's son,"
8382,OM.(8),His rank among the Bráhmans won.
8383,OM.(8),"Best of all hermits, Prince, is he;"
8384,OM.(8),In him incarnate Penance see.
8385,OM.(8),"Friend of the right, who shrinks from ill,"
8386,OM.(8),"Heroic powers attend him still."""
8387,OM.(8),
8388,OM.(8),"The Bráhman, versed in ancient lore,"
8389,OM.(8),"Thus closed his tale, and said no more,"
8390,OM.(8),To Satánanda Kusik's son
8391,OM.(8),"Cried in delight, Well done! well done!"
8392,OM.(8),"Then Janak, at the tale amazed,"
8393,OM.(8),Spoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:
8394,OM.(8),"""High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,"
8395,OM.(8),"And thanks I owe for bliss supreme,"
8396,OM.(8),That thou and Raghu's children too
8397,OM.(8),Have come my sacrifice to view.
8398,OM.(8),To look on thee with blessed eyes
8399,OM.(8),Exalts my soul and purifies.
8400,OM.(8),"Yea, thus to see thee face to face"
8401,OM.(8),Enriches me with store of grace.
8402,OM.(8),"Thy holy labours wrought of old,"
8403,OM.(8),"And mighty penance, fully told,"
8404,OM.(8),Ráma and I with great delight
8405,OM.(8),"Have heard, O glorious Anchorite."
8406,OM.(8),Unrivalled thine ascetic deeds:
8407,OM.(8),"Thy might, O Saint, all might exceeds."
8408,OM.(8),"No thought may scan, no limit bound"
8409,OM.(8),The virtues that in thee are found.
8410,OM.(8),The story of thy wondrous fate
8411,OM.(8),My thirsty ears can never sate.
8412,OM.(8),The hour of evening rites is near:
8413,OM.(8),The sun declines in swift career.
8414,OM.(8),"At early dawn, O Hermit, deign"
8415,OM.(8),To let me see thy face again.
8416,OM.(8),"Best of ascetics, part in bliss:"
8417,OM.(8),"Do thou thy servant now dismiss."""
8418,OM.(8),
8419,OM.(8),"The saint approved, and glad and kind"
8420,OM.(8),Dismissed the king with joyful mind
8421,OM.(8),Around the sage King Janak went
8422,OM.(8),With priests and kinsmen reverent.
8423,OM.(8),"Then Visvámitra, honoured so,"
8424,OM.(8),"By those high-minded, rose to go,"
8425,OM.(8),And with the princes took his way
8426,OM.(8),To seek the lodging where they lay.

8432,OM.(8),
8433,OM.(8),
8434,OM.(8),With cloudless lustre rose the sun;
8435,OM.(8),"The king, his morning worship done,"
8436,OM.(8),Ordered his heralds to invite
8437,OM.(8),The princes and the anchorite.
8438,OM.(8),"With honour, as the laws decree,"
8439,OM.(8),The monarch entertained the three.
8440,OM.(8),Then to the youths and saintly man
8441,OM.(8),Videha's lord this speech began:
8442,OM.(8),"""O blameless Saint, most welcome thou!"
8443,OM.(8),If I may please thee tell me how.
8444,OM.(8),"Speak, mighty lord, whom all revere,"
8445,OM.(8),"'Tis thine to order, mine to hear."""
8446,OM.(8),
8447,OM.(8),Thus he on mighty thoughts intent;
8448,OM.(8),Then thus the sage most eloquent:
8449,OM.(8),"""King Dasaratha's sons, this pair"
8450,OM.(8),"Of warriors famous everywhere,"
8451,OM.(8),Are come that best of bows to see
8452,OM.(8),That lies a treasure stored by thee.
8453,OM.(8),"This, mighty Janak, deign to show,"
8454,OM.(8),"That they may look upon the bow,"
8455,OM.(8),"And then, contented, homeward go."""
8456,OM.(8),Then royal Janak spoke in turn:
8457,OM.(8),"""O best of Saints, the story learn"
8458,OM.(8),"Why this famed bow, a noble prize,"
8459,OM.(8),A treasure in my palace lies.
8460,OM.(8),"A monarch, Devarát by name,"
8461,OM.(8),"Who sixth from ancient Nimi came,"
8462,OM.(8),"Held it as ruler of the land,"
8463,OM.(8),A pledge in his successive hand.
8464,OM.(8),This bow the mighty Rudra bore
8465,OM.(8),"At Daksha's(245) sacrifice of yore,"
8466,OM.(8),When carnage of the Immortals stained
8467,OM.(8),The rite that Daksha had ordained.
8468,OM.(8),"Then as the Gods sore wounded fled,"
8469,OM.(8),"Victorious Rudra, mocking, said:"
8470,OM.(8),"""Because, O Gods, ye gave me naught"
8471,OM.(8),"When I my rightful portion sought,"
8472,OM.(8),"Your dearest parts I will not spare,"
8473,OM.(8),"But with my bow your frames will tear."""
8474,OM.(8),
8475,OM.(8),"The Sons of Heaven, in wild alarm,"
8476,OM.(8),Soft flatteries tried his rage to charm.
8477,OM.(8),"Then Bhava, Lord whom Gods adore,"
8478,OM.(8),"Grew kind and friendly as before,"
8479,OM.(8),And every torn and mangled limb
8480,OM.(8),Was safe and sound restored by him.
8481,OM.(8),"Thenceforth this bow, the gem of bows,"
8482,OM.(8),"That freed the God of Gods from foes,"
8483,OM.(8),Stored by our great forefathers lay
8484,OM.(8),A treasure and a pride for aye.
8485,OM.(8),"Once, as it chanced, I ploughed the ground,"
8486,OM.(8),"When sudden, 'neath the share was found"
8487,OM.(8),"An infant springing from the earth,"
8488,OM.(8),Named Sítá from her secret birth.(246)
8489,OM.(8),"In strength and grace the maiden grew,"
8490,OM.(8),"My cherished daughter, fair to view."
8491,OM.(8),"I vowed her, of no mortal birth,"
8492,OM.(8),Meet prize for noblest hero's worth.
8493,OM.(8),"In strength and grace the maiden grew,"
8494,OM.(8),And many a monarch came to woo.
8495,OM.(8),To all the princely suitors I
8496,OM.(8),"Gave, mighty Saint, the same reply:"
8497,OM.(8),"""I give not thus my daughter, she"
8498,OM.(8),Prize of heroic worth shall be.(247)
8499,OM.(8),To Míthilá the suitors pressed
8500,OM.(8),Their power and might to manifest.
8501,OM.(8),To all who came with hearts aglow
8502,OM.(8),I offered Siva's wondrous bow.
8503,OM.(8),Not one of all the royal band
8504,OM.(8),Could raise or take the bow in hand.
8505,OM.(8),"The suitors' puny might I spurned,"
8506,OM.(8),And back the feeble princes turned.
8507,OM.(8),"Enraged thereat, the warriors met,"
8508,OM.(8),With force combined my town beset.
8509,OM.(8),"Stung to the heart with scorn and shame,"
8510,OM.(8),"With war and threats they madly came,"
8511,OM.(8),"Besieged my peaceful walls, and long"
8512,OM.(8),To Míthilá did grievous wrong.
8513,OM.(8),"There, wasting all, a year they lay,"
8514,OM.(8),"And brought my treasures to decay,"
8515,OM.(8),"Filling my soul, O Hermit chief,"
8516,OM.(8),With bitter woe and hopeless grief.
8517,OM.(8),At last by long-wrought penance I
8518,OM.(8),"Won favour with the Gods on high,"
8519,OM.(8),Who with my labours well content
8520,OM.(8),A four-fold host to aid me sent.
8521,OM.(8),Then swift the baffled heroes fled
8522,OM.(8),To all the winds discomfited--
8523,OM.(8),"Wrong-doers, with their lords and host,"
8524,OM.(8),And all their valour's idle boast.
8525,OM.(8),"This heavenly bow, exceeding bright,"
8526,OM.(8),"These youths shall see, O Anchorite."
8527,OM.(8),Then if young Ráma's hand can string
8528,OM.(8),"The bow that baffled lord and king,"
8529,OM.(8),"To him I give, as I have sworn,"

8536,OM.(8),
8537,OM.(8),
8538,OM.(8),Then spoke again the great recluse:
8539,OM.(8),"""This mighty bow, O King, produce."""
8540,OM.(8),"King Janak, at the saint's request,"
8541,OM.(8),This order to his train addressed:
8542,OM.(8),"""Let the great bow be hither borne,"
8543,OM.(8),"Which flowery wreaths and scents adorn."""
8544,OM.(8),"Soon as the monarch's words were said,"
8545,OM.(8),"His servants to the city sped,"
8546,OM.(8),"Five thousand youths in number, all"
8547,OM.(8),"Of manly strength and stature tall,"
8548,OM.(8),The ponderous eight-wheeled chest that held
8549,OM.(8),"The heavenly bow, with toil propelled."
8550,OM.(8),"At length they brought that iron chest,"
8551,OM.(8),And thus the godlike king addressed:
8552,OM.(8),"""This best of bows, O lord, we bring,"
8553,OM.(8),"Respected by each chief and king,"
8554,OM.(8),"And place it for these youths to see,"
8555,OM.(8),"If, Sovereign, such thy pleasure be."""
8556,OM.(8),
8557,OM.(8),With suppliant palm to palm applied
8558,OM.(8),King Janak to the strangers cried:
8559,OM.(8),"""This gem of bows, O Bráhman Sage,"
8560,OM.(8),"Our race has prized from age to age,"
8561,OM.(8),"Too strong for those who yet have reigned,"
8562,OM.(8),Though great in might each nerve they strained.
8563,OM.(8),"Titan and fiend its strength defies,"
8564,OM.(8),"God, spirit, minstrel of the skies."
8565,OM.(8),And bard above and snake below
8566,OM.(8),Are baffled by this glorious bow.
8567,OM.(8),Then how may human prowess hope
8568,OM.(8),With such a bow as this to cope?
8569,OM.(8),What man with valour's choicest gift
8570,OM.(8),"This bow can draw, or string, or lift?"
8571,OM.(8),"Yet let the princes, holy Seer,"
8572,OM.(8),"Behold it: it is present here."""
8573,OM.(8),
8574,OM.(8),Then spoke the hermit pious-souled:
8575,OM.(8),"""Ráma, dear son, the bow behold."""
8576,OM.(8),Then Ráma at his word unclosed
8577,OM.(8),"The chest wherein its might reposed,"
8578,OM.(8),"Thus crying, as he viewed it: ""Lo!"
8579,OM.(8),I lay mine hand upon the bow:
8580,OM.(8),May happy luck my hope attend
8581,OM.(8),"Its heavenly strength to lift or bend."""
8582,OM.(8),"""Good luck be thine,"" the hermit cried:"
8583,OM.(8),"""Assay the task!"" the king replied."
8584,OM.(8),"Then Raghu's son, as if in sport,"
8585,OM.(8),"Before the thousands of the court,"
8586,OM.(8),The weapon by the middle raised
8587,OM.(8),That all the crowd in wonder gazed.
8588,OM.(8),With steady arm the string he drew
8589,OM.(8),Till burst the mighty bow in two.
8590,OM.(8),"As snapped the bow, an awful clang,"
8591,OM.(8),"Loud as the shriek of tempests, rang."
8592,OM.(8),"The earth, affrighted, shook amain"
8593,OM.(8),As when a hill is rent in twain.
8594,OM.(8),"Then, senseless at the fearful sound,"
8595,OM.(8),The people fell upon the ground:
8596,OM.(8),"None save the king, the princely pair,"
8597,OM.(8),"And the great saint, the shock could bear."

9097,OM.(8),With willing ear the monarch heard:
9098,OM.(8),Vasishtha's lips the counsel praised:
9099,OM.(8),Then spake the king with hands upraised:
9100,OM.(8),"""Now blest indeed my race I deem,"
9101,OM.(8),"Which your high will, O Saints supreme,"
9102,OM.(8),With Dasaratha's house unites

9112,OM.(8),Then with raised hands in reverence due
9113,OM.(8),To those arch-saints he spoke anew:

9116,OM.(8),"Come, sit ye on my royal throne,"

9125,OM.(8),The realms of Mithilá obey.
9126,OM.(8),With honouring care you entertain.

9133,OM.(8),Then followed fast those holy two.
9134,OM.(8),The monarch reached his palace where
9135,OM.(8),The rites were paid with solemn care.
9136,OM.(8),When the next sun began to shine
9137,OM.(8),He rose and made his gift of kine.

9173,OM.(8),The king with kind observance cheered
9174,OM.(8),"His friend by tender ties endeared,"
9175,OM.(8),And every choicest honour pressed
9176,OM.(8),Upon his honourable guest.
9177,OM.(8),
9178,OM.(8),"That night with all his children spent,"
9179,OM.(8),"At morn King Dasaratha went,"
9180,OM.(8),"Behind Vasishtha and the rest,"
9181,OM.(8),To the fair ground for rites addressed.
9182,OM.(8),Then when the lucky hour was nigh
9183,OM.(8),"Called Victory, of omen high,"
9184,OM.(8),"Came Ráma, after vow and prayer"
9185,OM.(8),"For nuptial bliss and fortune fair,"

9187,OM.(8),And stood beside his royal sire.
9188,OM.(8),"To Janak then Vasishtha sped,"
9189,OM.(8),And to Videha's monarch said:
9190,OM.(8),"""O King, Ayodhyá's ruler now"
9191,OM.(8),"Has breathed the prayer and vowed the vow,"
9192,OM.(8),And with his sons expecting stands

9198,OM.(8),
9199,OM.(8),"Skilled in the laws which Scriptures teach,"

9201,OM.(8),"""O Saint, what warder bars the gate?"
9202,OM.(8),Whose bidding can the king await?
9203,OM.(8),In one's own house what doubt is shown?
9204,OM.(8),"This kingdom, Sage, is all thine own."
9205,OM.(8),E'en now the maidens may be found
9206,OM.(8),Within the sacrificial ground:
9207,OM.(8),"Each vow is vowed and prayed each prayer,"
9208,OM.(8),"And they, like fire, are shining there."
9209,OM.(8),Here by the shrine my place I took

9213,OM.(8),"When Janak's speech the monarch heard,"
9214,OM.(8),"To sons and saints he gave the word,"
9215,OM.(8),"And set them in the holy ring,"
9216,OM.(8),Then to Vasishtha spoke the king
9217,OM.(8),"Of Mithilá: ""O mighty Sage,"
9218,OM.(8),"Now let this task thy care engage,"
9219,OM.(8),And lend thine aid and counsel wise
9220,OM.(8),"The nuptial rites to solemnize."""
9221,OM.(8),
9222,OM.(8),"The saint Vasishtha gave assent,"

9225,OM.(8),And Satánanda aiding both.
9226,OM.(8),"Then, as the rules prescribe, they made"
9227,OM.(8),"An altar in the midst, and laid"
9228,OM.(8),Fresh wreaths of fragrant flowers thereon.
9229,OM.(8),The golden ladles round it shone;
9230,OM.(8),"And many a vase, which branches hid"
9231,OM.(8),"Fixed in the perforated lid,"
9232,OM.(8),"And sprays, and cups, and censers there"
9233,OM.(8),Stood filled with incense rich and rare;
9234,OM.(8),"Shell-bowls, and spoons, and salvers dressed"
9235,OM.(8),With gifts that greet the honoured guest;
9236,OM.(8),"Piles of parched rice some dishes bore,"
9237,OM.(8),Others with corn prepared ran o'er;
9238,OM.(8),And holy grass was duly spread
9239,OM.(8),"In equal lengths, while prayers were said."
9240,OM.(8),"Next chief of saints, Vasishtha came"
9241,OM.(8),And laid the offering in the flame.
9242,OM.(8),Then by the hand King Janak drew
9243,OM.(8),"His Sítá, beautiful to view,"
9244,OM.(8),"And placed her, bright in rich attire,"
9245,OM.(8),"Ráma to face, before the fire,"
9246,OM.(8),Thus speaking to the royal boy
9247,OM.(8),Who filled Kausalyá's heart with joy:
9248,OM.(8),"""Here Sítá stands, my daughter fair,"
9249,OM.(8),The duties of thy life to share.
9250,OM.(8),"Take from her father, take thy bride;"
9251,OM.(8),"Join hand to hand, and bliss betide!"
9252,OM.(8),"A faithful wife, most blest is she,"
9253,OM.(8),"And as thy shade will follow thee."""
9254,OM.(8),
9255,OM.(8),Thus as he spoke the monarch threw
9256,OM.(8),"O'er her young limbs the holy dew,"
9257,OM.(8),While Gods and saints were heard to swell
9258,OM.(8),"The joyous cry, 'Tis well! 'Tis well!"
9259,OM.(8),"His daughter Sítá thus bestowed,"
9260,OM.(8),O'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.
9261,OM.(8),King Janak's heart with rapture glowed.
9262,OM.(8),Then to Prince Lakshman thus he cried:
9263,OM.(8),"""Take Urmilá thine offered bride,"
9264,OM.(8),And clasp her hand within thine own
9265,OM.(8),"Ere yet the lucky hour be flown."""
9266,OM.(8),Then to Prince Bharat thus cried he;
9267,OM.(8),"""Come, take the hand of Mándavi."""
9268,OM.(8),"Then to Satrughna: ""In thy grasp"
9269,OM.(8),The hand of Srutakírti clasp.
9270,OM.(8),"Now, Raghu's sons, may all of you"
9271,OM.(8),Be gentle to your wives and true;
9272,OM.(8),"Keep well the vows you make to-day,"
9273,OM.(8),"Nor let occasion slip away."""
9274,OM.(8),
9275,OM.(8),King Janak's word the youths obeyed;
9276,OM.(8),The maidens' hands in theirs they laid.
9277,OM.(8),Then with their brides the princes went
9278,OM.(8),With ordered steps and reverent
9279,OM.(8),"Round both the fire and Janak, round"
9280,OM.(8),The sages and the sacred ground.
9281,OM.(8),
9282,OM.(8),A flowery flood of lucid dyes
9283,OM.(8),"In rain descended from the skies,"
9284,OM.(8),While with celestial voices blent
9285,OM.(8),"Sweet strains from many an instrument,"
9286,OM.(8),And the nymphs danced in joyous throng
9287,OM.(8),Responsive to the minstrel's song.
9288,OM.(8),Such signs of exultation they
9289,OM.(8),Saw on the princes' wedding day.
9290,OM.(8),Still rang the heavenly music's sound
9291,OM.(8),When Raghu's sons thrice circled round
9292,OM.(8),"The fire, each one with reverent head,"
9293,OM.(8),And homeward then their brides they led.
9294,OM.(8),They to the sumptuous palace hied
9295,OM.(8),That Janak's care had seen supplied.
9296,OM.(8),The monarch girt with saint and peer
9297,OM.(8),Still fondly gazing followed near.

9305,OM.(8),Soon as the night had reached its close
9306,OM.(8),The hermit Visvámitra rose;
9307,OM.(8),To both the kings he bade adieu
9308,OM.(8),And to the northern hill withdrew.
9309,OM.(8),Ayodhyá's lord of high renown
9310,OM.(8),"Received farewell, and sought his town."
9311,OM.(8),Then as each daughter left her bower
9312,OM.(8),"King Janak gave a splendid dower,"
9313,OM.(8),"Rugs, precious silks, a warrior force,"
9314,OM.(8),"Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,"
9315,OM.(8),Divine to see and well arrayed;

9318,OM.(8),The father of the ladies gave.
9319,OM.(8),"Silver and coral, gold and pearls"
9320,OM.(8),He gave to his beloved girls.

9322,OM.(8),And sped his guest upon his road.
9323,OM.(8),The lord of Mithilá's sweet town
9324,OM.(8),Rode to his court and lighted down.
9325,OM.(8),"Ayodhyá's monarch, glad and gay,"
9326,OM.(8),Led by the seers pursued his way
9327,OM.(8),With his dear sons of lofty mind:
9328,OM.(8),The royal army marched behind.
9329,OM.(8),As on he fared the voice he heard
9330,OM.(8),"Around of many a dismal bird,"
9331,OM.(8),And every beast in wild affright
9332,OM.(8),Began to hurry to the right.
9333,OM.(8),The monarch to Vasishtha cried:
9334,OM.(8),"""What strange misfortune will betide?"
9335,OM.(8),"Why do the beasts in terror fly,"
9336,OM.(8),And birds of evil omen cry?
9337,OM.(8),What is it shakes my heart with dread?
9338,OM.(8),"Why is my soul disquieted?"""
9339,OM.(8),
9340,OM.(8),"Soon as he heard, the mighty saint"
9341,OM.(8),Thus answered Dasaratha's plaint
9342,OM.(8),"In sweetest tone: ""Now, Monarch, mark,"
9343,OM.(8),And learn from me the meaning dark.
9344,OM.(8),The voices of the birds of air
9345,OM.(8),Great peril to the host declare:

9350,OM.(8),"A tempest from the welkin broke,"
9351,OM.(8),That shook the spacious earth amain
9352,OM.(8),And hurled high trees upon the plain.
9353,OM.(8),"The sun grew dark with murky cloud,"
9354,OM.(8),"And o'er the skies was cast a shroud,"
9355,OM.(8),"While o'er the army, faint with dread,"
9356,OM.(8),A veil of dust and ashes spread.
9357,OM.(8),"King, princes, saints their sense retained,"
9358,OM.(8),Fear-stupefied the rest remained.
9359,OM.(8),"At length, their wits returning, all"
9360,OM.(8),Beneath the gloom and ashy pall
9361,OM.(8),"Saw Jamadagni's son with dread,"
9362,OM.(8),"His long hair twisted round his head,"
9363,OM.(8),"Who, sprung from Bhrigu, loved to beat"
9364,OM.(8),The proudest kings beneath his feet.
9365,OM.(8),"Firm as Kailása's hill he showed,"
9366,OM.(8),Fierce as the fire of doom he glowed.
9367,OM.(8),"His axe upon his shoulder lay,"
9368,OM.(8),"His bow was ready for the fray,"
9369,OM.(8),With thirsty arrows wont to fly
9370,OM.(8),Like Lightnings from the angry sky.
9371,OM.(8),"A long keen arrow forth he drew,"
9372,OM.(8),Invincible like those which flew
9373,OM.(8),From Siva's ever-conquering bow
9374,OM.(8),And Tripura in death laid low.
9375,OM.(8),
9376,OM.(8),"When his wild form, that struck with awe,"
9377,OM.(8),"Fearful as ravening flame, they saw,"
9378,OM.(8),Vasishtha and the saints whose care
9379,OM.(8),"Was sacrifice and muttered prayer,"
9380,OM.(8),"Drew close together, each to each,"
9381,OM.(8),And questioned thus with bated speech:
9382,OM.(8),"""Indignant at his father's fate"
9383,OM.(8),"Will he on warriors vent his hate,"
9384,OM.(8),"The slayers of his father slay,"
9385,OM.(8),And sweep the loathed race away?
9386,OM.(8),But when of old his fury raged
9387,OM.(8),Seas of their blood his wrath assuaged:
9388,OM.(8),So doubtless now he has not planned
9389,OM.(8),"To slay all warriors in the land."""
9390,OM.(8),
9391,OM.(8),Then with a gift the saints drew near
9392,OM.(8),"To Bhrigu's son whose look was fear,"
9393,OM.(8),And Ráma! Ráma! soft they cried.
9394,OM.(8),"The gift he took, no word replied."
9395,OM.(8),Then Bhrigu's son his silence broke
9396,OM.(8),And thus to Ráma Ráma spoke:

9406,OM.(8),And I from loud-voiced rumour know
9407,OM.(8),"The exploit of the broken bow,"
9408,OM.(8),"Yea, bent and broken, mighty Chief,"
9409,OM.(8),"A feat most wondrous, past belief."
9410,OM.(8),Stirred by thy fame thy face I sought:
9411,OM.(8),A peerless bow I too have brought.
9412,OM.(8),"This mighty weapon, strong and dire,"
9413,OM.(8),"Great Jamadagni owned, my sire."
9414,OM.(8),"Draw with its shaft my father's bow,"
9415,OM.(8),"And thus thy might, O Ráma, show."
9416,OM.(8),This proof of prowess let me see--
9417,OM.(8),The weapon bent and drawn by thee;
9418,OM.(8),"Then single fight our strength shall try,"
9419,OM.(8),"And this shall raise thy glory high."""
9420,OM.(8),
9421,OM.(8),King Dasaratha heard with dread
9422,OM.(8),"The boastful speech, and thus he said;"
9423,OM.(8),"Raising his hands in suppliant guise,"
9424,OM.(8),With pallid cheek and timid eyes:
9425,OM.(8),"""Forgetful of the bloody feud"
9426,OM.(8),Ascetic toils hast thou pursued;
9427,OM.(8),"Then, Bráhman, let thy children be"
9428,OM.(8),Untroubled and from danger free.
9429,OM.(8),"Sprung of the race of Bhrigu, who"
9430,OM.(8),"Read holy lore, to vows most true,"
9431,OM.(8),Thou swarest to the Thousand-eyed
9432,OM.(8),And thy fierce axe was cast aside.
9433,OM.(8),Thou turnedst to thy rites away
9434,OM.(8),"Leaving the earth to Kasyap's sway,"
9435,OM.(8),And wentest far a grove to seek
9436,OM.(8),Beneath Mahendra's(255) mountain peak.
9437,OM.(8),"Now, mighty Hermit, art thou here"
9438,OM.(8),To slay us all with doom severe?
9439,OM.(8),"For if alone my Ráma fall,"
9440,OM.(8),"We share his fate and perish all."""
9441,OM.(8),
9442,OM.(8),As thus the aged sire complained
9443,OM.(8),The mighty chief no answer deigned.
9444,OM.(8),To Ráma only thus he cried:
9445,OM.(8),"""Two bows, the Heavenly Artist's pride,"
9446,OM.(8),"Celestial, peerless, vast, and strong,"
9447,OM.(8),By all the worlds were honoured long.
9448,OM.(8),"One to the Three-eyed God(256) was given,"
9449,OM.(8),"By glory to the conflict driven,"
9450,OM.(8),Thus armed fierce Tripura he slew:
9451,OM.(8),And then by thee 'twas burst in two.
9452,OM.(8),"The second bow, which few may brave,"
9453,OM.(8),The highest Gods to Vishnu gave.
9454,OM.(8),This bow I hold; before it fall
9455,OM.(8),The foeman's fenced tower and wall.
9456,OM.(8),Then prayed the Gods the Sire Most High
9457,OM.(8),By some unerring proof to try
9458,OM.(8),"Were praise for might Lord Vishnu's due,"
9459,OM.(8),Or his whose Neck is stained with Blue.(257)
9460,OM.(8),"The mighty Sire their wishes knew,"
9461,OM.(8),And he whose lips are ever true
9462,OM.(8),Caused the two Gods to meet as foes.
9463,OM.(8),Then fierce the rage of battle rose:
9464,OM.(8),Bristled in dread each starting hair
9465,OM.(8),As Siva strove with Vishnu there.
9466,OM.(8),But Vishnu raised his voice amain.
9467,OM.(8),And Siva's bowstring twanged in vain;
9468,OM.(8),Its master of the Three bright Eyes
9469,OM.(8),Stood fixt in fury and surprise.
9470,OM.(8),"Then all the dwellers in the sky,"
9471,OM.(8),"Minstrel, and saint, and God drew nigh,"
9472,OM.(8),"And prayed them that the strife might cease,"
9473,OM.(8),And the great rivals met in peace.
9474,OM.(8),'Twas seen how Siva's bow has failed
9475,OM.(8),"Unnerved, when Vishnu's might assailed,"
9476,OM.(8),And Gods and heavenly sages thence
9477,OM.(8),To Vishnu gave preëminence.
9478,OM.(8),Then glorious Siva in his rage
9479,OM.(8),Gave it to Devarát the sage
9480,OM.(8),"Who ruled Videha's fertile land,"
9481,OM.(8),To pass it down from hand to hand.
9482,OM.(8),"But this my bow, whose shafts smite down"
9483,OM.(8),"The foeman's fenced tower and town,"
9484,OM.(8),To great Richíka Vishnu lent
9485,OM.(8),"To be a pledge and ornament,"
9486,OM.(8),"Then Jamadagni, Bráhman dread,"
9487,OM.(8),"My sire, the bow inherited."
9488,OM.(8),But Arjun stooped to treachery vile
9489,OM.(8),"And slew my noble sire by guile,"
9490,OM.(8),"Whose penance awful strength had gained,"
9491,OM.(8),Whose hand the God-given bow retained.
9492,OM.(8),I heard indignant how he fell
9493,OM.(8),"By mournful fate, too sad to tell."
9494,OM.(8),My vengeful fury since that time
9495,OM.(8),Scourges all Warriors for the crime.
9496,OM.(8),As generations spring to life

9501,OM.(8),The rites performed by him were o'er.
9502,OM.(8),Then to Mahendra's hill I turned
9503,OM.(8),"Strong in the strength that penance earned,"
9504,OM.(8),And toiled upon his lofty head
9505,OM.(8),By Gods immortal visited.
9506,OM.(8),The breaking of the bow I knew
9507,OM.(8),"From startled Gods conversing, through"
9508,OM.(8),"The airy regions, of thy deed,"
9509,OM.(8),And hither came with swiftest speed.
9510,OM.(8),"Now, for thy Warrior's honour sake,"
9511,OM.(8),"This best of bows, O Ráma, take:"
9512,OM.(8),"This, owned by Vishnu's self of old,"
9513,OM.(8),My sire and grandsire loved to hold.
9514,OM.(8),"Drawn to its head upon the string,"
9515,OM.(8),One town-destroying arrow bring;

9525,OM.(8),"The haughty challenge, undeterred"
9526,OM.(8),"The son of Dasaratha heard,"
9527,OM.(8),"And cried, while reverence for his sire"
9528,OM.(8),Checked the full torrent of his ire:
9529,OM.(8),"""Before this day have I been told"
9530,OM.(8),The deed that stained thy hands of old.
9531,OM.(8),But pity bids my soul forget:
9532,OM.(8),"Thy father, murdered, claimed the debt."
9533,OM.(8),"My strength, O Chief, thou deemest slight,"
9534,OM.(8),Too feeble for a Warrior's might.
9535,OM.(8),Now will I show thy wondering eyes
9536,OM.(8),"The prowess which they dare despise."""
9537,OM.(8),
9538,OM.(8),He hastened then with graceful ease
9539,OM.(8),That mighty bow and shaft to seize.
9540,OM.(8),His hand the weapon strung and swayed:
9541,OM.(8),The arrow on the string was laid.
9542,OM.(8),"Then Jamadagni's son he eyed,"
9543,OM.(8),And thus in words of fury cried:
9544,OM.(8),"""Thou art a Bráhman, still to be"
9545,OM.(8),"Most highly honoured, Chief, by me."
9546,OM.(8),For Visvámitra's sake beside
9547,OM.(8),Shall reverence due be ne'er denied.
9548,OM.(8),"Though mine the power, I would not send"
9549,OM.(8),A dart at thee thy life to end.
9550,OM.(8),"But thy great power to wander free,"
9551,OM.(8),"Which penance-rites have won for thee,"
9552,OM.(8),"Or glorious worlds from thee to wrest,"
9553,OM.(8),"Is the firm purpose of my breast,"
9554,OM.(8),And Vishnu's dart which now I strain
9555,OM.(8),Can ne'er be shot to fall in vain:
9556,OM.(8),"It strikes the mighty, and it stuns"
9557,OM.(8),"The madness of the haughty ones."""
9558,OM.(8),
9559,OM.(8),"Then Gods, and saints and heavenly choir"
9560,OM.(8),"Preceded by the General Sire,"
9561,OM.(8),Met in the air and gazed below
9562,OM.(8),On Ráma with that wondrous bow.
9563,OM.(8),"Nymph, minstrel, angel, all were there,"
9564,OM.(8),"Snake-God, and spirit of the air,"
9565,OM.(8),"Giant, and bard, and gryphon, met,"
9566,OM.(8),Their eyes upon the marvel set.
9567,OM.(8),In senseless hush the world was chained
9568,OM.(8),"While Ráma's hand the bow retained,"
9569,OM.(8),And Jamadagni's son amazed
9570,OM.(8),And powerless on the hero gazed.
9571,OM.(8),"Then when his swelling heart had shrunk,"
9572,OM.(8),"And his proud strength in torpor sunk,"
9573,OM.(8),"Scarce his voice ventured, low and weak,"

9576,OM.(8),The whole broad land to Kasyap's sway
9577,OM.(8),He charged me never to remain
9578,OM.(8),Within the limits of his reign.
9579,OM.(8),Obedient to my guide's behest
9580,OM.(8),On earth by night I never rest.
9581,OM.(8),"My choice is made, I will not dim"
9582,OM.(8),Mine honour and be false to him.

9584,OM.(8),"The power to wander where I will,"
9585,OM.(8),And swifter than the thought my flight

9588,OM.(8),"By penance won, thou mayst destroy,"

9598,OM.(8),Whose arm in war no God can meet.
9599,OM.(8),"No shame is mine, I ween, for thou,"
9600,OM.(8),"Lord of the Worlds, hast dimmed my brow."
9601,OM.(8),"Now, pious Ráma, 'tis thy part"
9602,OM.(8),To shoot afar that glorious dart:

9605,OM.(8),
9606,OM.(8),"He ceased. The wondrous arrow flew,"
9607,OM.(8),And Jamadagni's offspring knew
9608,OM.(8),"Those glorious worlds to him were barred,"
9609,OM.(8),Once gained by penance long and hard.
9610,OM.(8),"Then straight the airy quarters cleared,"
9611,OM.(8),"And the mid regions bright appeared,"
9612,OM.(8),While Gods and saints unnumbered praised
9613,OM.(8),"Ráma, the mighty bow who raised."
9614,OM.(8),"And Jamadagni's son, o'erawed."
9615,OM.(8),"Extolled his name with highest laud,"
9616,OM.(8),"With reverent steps around him strode,"
9617,OM.(8),Then hastened on his airy road.
9618,OM.(8),"Far from the sight of all he fled,"

9628,OM.(8),The bow to Varun's hand resigned.
9629,OM.(8),"Due reverence to the saints he paid,"
9630,OM.(8),And thus addressed his sire dismayed:
9631,OM.(8),"""As Bhrigu's son is far from view,"
9632,OM.(8),"Now let the host its march pursue,"
9633,OM.(8),And to Ayodhyá's town proceed
9634,OM.(8),"In four-fold bands, with thee to lead."""
9635,OM.(8),
9636,OM.(8),King Dasaratha thus addressed
9637,OM.(8),"His lips to Ráma's forehead pressed,"
9638,OM.(8),And held him to his aged breast.
9639,OM.(8),Rejoiced in sooth was he to know
9640,OM.(8),"That Bhrigu's son had parted so,"
9641,OM.(8),And hailed a second life begun
9642,OM.(8),For him and his victorious son.
9643,OM.(8),"He urged the host to speed renewed,"
9644,OM.(8),And soon Ayodhyá's gates he viewed.
9645,OM.(8),High o'er the roofs gay pennons played;
9646,OM.(8),Tabour and drum loud music made;
9647,OM.(8),"Fresh water cooled the royal road,"
9648,OM.(8),And flowers in bright profusion glowed.
9649,OM.(8),Glad crowds with garlands thronged the ways
9650,OM.(8),Rejoicing on their king to gaze
9651,OM.(8),And all the town was bright and gay
9652,OM.(8),Exalting in the festive day.
9653,OM.(8),People and Bráhmans flocked to meet
9654,OM.(8),Their monarch ere he gained the street.
9655,OM.(8),The glorious king amid the throng
9656,OM.(8),"Rode with his glorious sons along,"
9657,OM.(8),And passed within his dear abode
9658,OM.(8),That like Himálaya's mountain showed.
9659,OM.(8),"And there Kausalyá, noble queen,"
9660,OM.(8),"Sumitrá with her lovely mien,"
9661,OM.(8),"Kaikeyí of the dainty waist,"
9662,OM.(8),"And other dames his bowers who graced,"
9663,OM.(8),Stood in the palace side by side
9664,OM.(8),And welcomed home each youthful bride:
9665,OM.(8),"Fair Sítá, lofty-fated dame,"
9666,OM.(8),"Urmilá of the glorious fame,"
9667,OM.(8),"And Kusadhwaj's children fair,"
9668,OM.(8),"With joyous greeting and with prayer,"
9669,OM.(8),As all in linen robes arrayed
9670,OM.(8),With offerings at the altars prayed.
9671,OM.(8),"Due reverence paid to God above,"
9672,OM.(8),"Each princess gave her soul to love,"
9673,OM.(8),And hidden in her inmost bower
9674,OM.(8),Passed with her lord each blissful hour.
9675,OM.(8),"The royal youths, of spirit high,"
9676,OM.(8),"With whom in valor none could vie,"
9677,OM.(8),Lived each within his palace bounds
9678,OM.(8),"Bright as Kuvera's pleasure-grounds,"
9679,OM.(8),"With riches, troops of faithful friends,"
9680,OM.(8),And bliss that wedded life attends:
9681,OM.(8),"Brave princes trained in warlike skill,"
9682,OM.(8),And duteous to their father's will.
9683,OM.(8),At length the monarch called one morn
9684,OM.(8),"Prince Bharat, of Kaikeyí born,"
9685,OM.(8),"And cried: ""My son, within our gates"
9686,OM.(8),Lord Yudhájit thine uncle waits.
9687,OM.(8),"The son of Kekaya's king is he,"
9688,OM.(8),"And came, my child, to summon thee."""
9689,OM.(8),
9690,OM.(8),"Then Bharat for the road prepared,"
9691,OM.(8),And with Satrughna forth he fared.
9692,OM.(8),"First to his sire he bade adieu,"
9693,OM.(8),"Brave Ráma, and his mothers too."
9694,OM.(8),Lord Yudhájit with joyful pride
9695,OM.(8),"Went forth, the brothers by his side,"
9696,OM.(8),And reached the city where he dwelt:
9697,OM.(8),And mighty joy his father felt.
9698,OM.(8),
9699,OM.(8),Ráma and Lakshman honoured still
9700,OM.(8),Their godlike sire with duteous will.
9701,OM.(8),"Two constant guides for Ráma stood,"
9702,OM.(8),"His father's wish, the people's good."
9703,OM.(8),Attentive to the general weal
9704,OM.(8),He thought and wrought to please and heal.
9705,OM.(8),His mothers too he strove to please
9706,OM.(8),With love and sonly courtesies.
9707,OM.(8),"At every time, in every spot,"
9708,OM.(8),His holy guides he ne'er forgot.
9709,OM.(8),So for his virtues kind and true
9710,OM.(8),Dearer and dearer Ráma grew
9711,OM.(8),"To Dasaratha, Bráhmans, all"
9712,OM.(8),"In town and country, great and small."
9713,OM.(8),And Ráma by his darling's side
9714,OM.(8),"Saw many a blissful season glide,"
9715,OM.(8),"Lodged in her soul, each thought on her,"
9716,OM.(8),"Lover, and friend, and worshipper."
9717,OM.(8),He loved her for his father's voice
9718,OM.(8),Had given her and approved the choice:
9719,OM.(8),He loved her for each charm she wore
9720,OM.(8),And her sweet virtues more and more.
9721,OM.(8),So he her lord and second life
9722,OM.(8),"Dwelt in the bosom of his wife,"
9723,OM.(8),"In double form, that, e'en apart,"
9724,OM.(8),Each heart could commune free with heart.
9725,OM.(8),
9726,OM.(8),"Still grew that child of Janak's race,"
9727,OM.(8),"More goddess-fair in form and face,"
9728,OM.(8),"The loveliest wife that e'er was seen,"
9729,OM.(8),In mortal mould sweet Beauty's Queen.
9730,OM.(8),"Then shone the son Kausalyá bore,"
9731,OM.(8),"With this bright dame allied,"
9732,OM.(8),"Like Vishnu whom the Gods adore,"
9733,OM.(8),With Lakshmi by his side.

9768,BOOK II.,"But best and noblest of the four,"
9769,BOOK II.,"Good as the God whom all adore,"
9770,BOOK II.,"Lord of all virtues, undefiled,"

9779,BOOK II.,"Revered for virtue and for age,"
9780,BOOK II.,And when his martial tasks were o'er
9781,BOOK II.,Sate listening to their peaceful lore.
9782,BOOK II.,"Wise, modest, pure, he honoured eld,"
9783,BOOK II.,His lips from lying tales withheld;
9784,BOOK II.,"Due reverence to the Bráhmans gave,"
9785,BOOK II.,And ruled each passion like a slave.
9786,BOOK II.,"Most tender, prompt at duty's call,"
9787,BOOK II.,Loved by all men he loved them all.
9788,BOOK II.,"Proud of the duties of his race,"

9796,BOOK II.,"In art and science duly trained,"

9800,BOOK II.,And with his well-drawn bow at last
9801,BOOK II.,His mighty father's fame surpassed.
9802,BOOK II.,"Of birth exalted, truthful, just,"

9826,BOOK II.,"Skilled to attack, to deal the blow,"
9827,BOOK II.,Or lead a host against the foe:
9828,BOOK II.,"Yea, e'en infuriate Gods would fear"
9829,BOOK II.,To meet his arm in full career.
9830,BOOK II.,As the great sun in noontide blaze
9831,BOOK II.,"Is glorious with his world of rays,"

9833,BOOK II.,Which all men loved to gaze upon.

9845,BOOK II.,In him the monarch saw combined
9846,BOOK II.,"The fairest form, the noblest mind,"
9847,BOOK II.,"And counselled how his son might share,"
9848,BOOK II.,The throne with him as Regent Heir.
9849,BOOK II.,"For fearful signs in earth and sky,"
9850,BOOK II.,And weakness warned him death was nigh:
9851,BOOK II.,But Ráma to the world endeared
9852,BOOK II.,"By every grace his bosom cheered,"
9853,BOOK II.,"The moon of every eye, whose ray"
9854,BOOK II.,Drove all his grief and fear away.
9855,BOOK II.,"So duty urged that hour to seize,"
9856,BOOK II.,"Himself, his realm, to bless and please."
9857,BOOK II.,
9858,BOOK II.,"From town and country, far and near,"

9862,BOOK II.,"Then, splendid in his king's attire,"
9863,BOOK II.,"He viewed them, as the general Sire,"
9864,BOOK II.,"In glory of a God arrayed,"
9865,BOOK II.,Looks on the creatures he has made.
9866,BOOK II.,But Kekaya's king he called not then
9867,BOOK II.,"For haste, nor Janak, lord of men;"
9868,BOOK II.,For after to each royal friend
9869,BOOK II.,The joyful tidings he would send.
9870,BOOK II.,Mid crowds from distant countries met
9871,BOOK II.,The king upon his throne was set;
9872,BOOK II.,"Then honoured by the people, all"
9873,BOOK II.,The rulers thronged into the hall.
9874,BOOK II.,"On thrones assigned, each king in place"
9875,BOOK II.,Looked silent on the monarch's face.
9876,BOOK II.,Then girt by lords of high renown
9877,BOOK II.,And throngs from hamlet and from town
9878,BOOK II.,"He showed in regal pride,"
9879,BOOK II.,"As, honoured by the radiant band"

9891,BOOK II.,"With gracious speech, in accents loud"
9892,BOOK II.,As heavenly drum or thunder-cloud:
9893,BOOK II.,
9894,BOOK II.,"""Needs not to you who know declare"
9895,BOOK II.,How ever with paternal care
9896,BOOK II.,My fathers of Ikshváku's line
9897,BOOK II.,Have ruled the realm which now is mine.
9898,BOOK II.,I too have taught my feet to tread
9899,BOOK II.,"The pathway of the mighty dead,"
9900,BOOK II.,And with fond care that never slept
9901,BOOK II.,"Have, as I could, my people kept."

9905,BOOK II.,Old age is come and strength decayed.
9906,BOOK II.,"Thousands of years have o'er me flown,"

9908,BOOK II.,And passed away. I crave at length
9909,BOOK II.,Repose and ease for broken strength.
9910,BOOK II.,Feeble and worn I scarce can bear
9911,BOOK II.,"The ruler's toil, the judge's care,"
9912,BOOK II.,"With royal dignity, a weight"
9913,BOOK II.,That tries the young and temperate.
9914,BOOK II.,"I long to rest, my labour done,"
9915,BOOK II.,"And in my place to set my son,"

9923,BOOK II.,"The best maintainer of the right,"
9924,BOOK II.,Fair as the moon when nothing bars
9925,BOOK II.,"His glory close to Pushya's stars,"
9926,BOOK II.,Him with to-morrow's light I fain
9927,BOOK II.,Would throne the consort of my reign.
9928,BOOK II.,"A worthy lord for you, I ween,"
9929,BOOK II.,Marked as her own by Fortune's Queen.
9930,BOOK II.,The triple world itself would be
9931,BOOK II.,Well ruled by such a king as he.
9932,BOOK II.,To such high bliss and happy fate
9933,BOOK II.,"Will I the country dedicate,"
9934,BOOK II.,And my sad heart will cease to grieve
9935,BOOK II.,If he the precious charge receive.
9936,BOOK II.,"Thus is my careful plan matured,"
9937,BOOK II.,Thus for myself is rest secured;
9938,BOOK II.,"Lieges, approve the words I say,"
9939,BOOK II.,Or point ye out some wiser way.
9940,BOOK II.,Devise your prudent plan. My mind
9941,BOOK II.,"Is fondly to this thought inclined,"
9942,BOOK II.,But men by keen debating move
9943,BOOK II.,"Some middle course which all approve."""
9944,BOOK II.,
9945,BOOK II.,The monarch ceased. In answer came
9946,BOOK II.,The joyous princes' glad acclaim.
9947,BOOK II.,So peacocks in the rain rejoice
9948,BOOK II.,And hail the cloud with lifted voice.
9949,BOOK II.,Murmurs of joy from thousands round
9950,BOOK II.,Shook the high palace with the sound.
9951,BOOK II.,Then when the gathered throng had learned
9952,BOOK II.,"His will who right and gain discerned,"
9953,BOOK II.,"Peasant and townsman, priest and chief,"
9954,BOOK II.,"All met in consultation brief,"
9955,BOOK II.,And soon agreed with one accord
9956,BOOK II.,Gave answer to their sovereign lord:
9957,BOOK II.,"""King of the land, we know thee old:"
9958,BOOK II.,"Thousands of years have o'er thee rolled,"
9959,BOOK II.,"Ráma thy son, we pray, anoint,"
9960,BOOK II.,And at thy side his place appoint
9961,BOOK II.,"Our gallant prince, so brave and strong,"
9962,BOOK II.,"Riding in royal state along,"
9963,BOOK II.,Our eyes with joyful pride will see
9964,BOOK II.,"Screened by the shade that shelters thee."""
9965,BOOK II.,"Then spake the king again, as though"
9966,BOOK II.,Their hearts' true wish he sought to know:
9967,BOOK II.,"""These prayers for Ráma's rule suggest"
9968,BOOK II.,One question to my doubting breast.
9969,BOOK II.,"This thing, I pray, with truth explain:"
9970,BOOK II.,"Why would ye, while I justly reign,"
9971,BOOK II.,"That he, mine eldest son, should bear"
9972,BOOK II.,"His part with me as ruling heir?"""
9973,BOOK II.,"Then all the people made reply,"
9974,BOOK II.,"Peasant and townsman, low and high:"
9975,BOOK II.,"""Each noblest gift of form and mind,"
9976,BOOK II.,"O Monarch, in thy son we find."
9977,BOOK II.,Do thou the godlike virtues hear
9978,BOOK II.,Which Ráma to our hearts endear.
9979,BOOK II.,"So richly blest with graces, none"
9980,BOOK II.,In all the earth excels thy son:
9981,BOOK II.,"Nay, who to match with him may claim"
9982,BOOK II.,"In truth, in justice, and in fame?"
9983,BOOK II.,"True to his promise, gentle, kind,"
9984,BOOK II.,"Unenvious, of grateful mind,"
9985,BOOK II.,"Versed in the law and firm of soul,"
9986,BOOK II.,He keeps each sense with strict control.
9987,BOOK II.,With duteous care he loves to sit
9988,BOOK II.,By Bráhmans skilled in Holy Writ.
9989,BOOK II.,"Hence brightest glory, ne'er to end,"
9990,BOOK II.,And matchless fame his youth attend.
9991,BOOK II.,"Skilled in the use of spear and shield,"
9992,BOOK II.,"And arms which heavenly warriors wield,"
9993,BOOK II.,"Supreme in war, unconquered yet"
9994,BOOK II.,"By man, fiend, God in battle met,"
9995,BOOK II.,Whene'er in pomp of war he goes
9996,BOOK II.,"'Gainst town or city of the foes,"
9997,BOOK II.,He ever comes with Lakshman back
9998,BOOK II.,Victorious from the fierce attack.
9999,BOOK II.,Returning homeward from afar
10000,BOOK II.,"Borne on his elephant or car,"
10001,BOOK II.,He ever to the townsmen bends
10002,BOOK II.,"And greets them as beloved friends,"
10003,BOOK II.,"Asks how each son, each servant thrives,"
10004,BOOK II.,"How fare our pupils, offerings, wives;"
10005,BOOK II.,"And like a father bids us tell,"
10006,BOOK II.,"Each for himself, that all is well."
10007,BOOK II.,If pain or grief the city tries
10008,BOOK II.,His heart is swift to sympathize.
10009,BOOK II.,When festive scenes our thoughts employ
10010,BOOK II.,He like a father shares the joy.
10011,BOOK II.,"High is the fate, O King, that gave"
10012,BOOK II.,"Thy Ráma born to bless and save,"
10013,BOOK II.,With filial virtues fair and mild
10014,BOOK II.,Like Kasyap old Maríchi's child.
10015,BOOK II.,Hence to the kingdom's distant ends
10016,BOOK II.,One general prayer for him ascends.
10017,BOOK II.,Each man in town and country prays
10018,BOOK II.,"For Ráma's strength, health, length of days."
10019,BOOK II.,"With hearts sincere, their wish the same,"
10020,BOOK II.,"The tender girl, the aged dame,"
10021,BOOK II.,"Subject and stranger, peasant, hind,"
10022,BOOK II.,"One thought impressed on every mind,"
10023,BOOK II.,At evening and at dawning day
10024,BOOK II.,To all the Gods for Ráma pray.
10025,BOOK II.,"Do thou, O King, of grace comply,"
10026,BOOK II.,"And hear the people's longing cry,"
10027,BOOK II.,And let us on the throne by thee
10028,BOOK II.,The lotus-tinted Ráma see.
10029,BOOK II.,"O thou who givest boons, attend;"
10030,BOOK II.,"A gracious ear, O Monarch, lend"
10031,BOOK II.,"And for our weal install,"
10032,BOOK II.,"Consenting to our earnest prayer,"
10033,BOOK II.,"Thy godlike Ráma Regent Heir,"
10034,BOOK II.,"Who seeks the good of all."""

10040,BOOK II.,
10041,BOOK II.,
10042,BOOK II.,The monarch with the prayer complied
10043,BOOK II.,"Of suppliant hands, on every side"
10044,BOOK II.,Uplifted like a lotus-bed:
10045,BOOK II.,And then these gracious words he said:
10046,BOOK II.,"""Great joy and mighty fame are mine"
10047,BOOK II.,"Because your loving hearts incline,"
10048,BOOK II.,In full assembly clearly shown
10049,BOOK II.,"To place my Ráma on the throne."""
10050,BOOK II.,"Then to Vasishtha, standing near,"
10051,BOOK II.,And Vámadeva loud and clear
10052,BOOK II.,The monarch spoke that all might hear:
10053,BOOK II.,"""'Tis pure and lovely Chaitra now"
10054,BOOK II.,When flowers are sweet on every bough;
10055,BOOK II.,All needful things with haste prepare
10056,BOOK II.,"That Ráma be appointed heir."""
10057,BOOK II.,
10058,BOOK II.,Then burst the people's rapture out
10059,BOOK II.,In loud acclaim and joyful shout;
10060,BOOK II.,And when the tumult slowly ceased
10061,BOOK II.,The king addressed the holy priest:
10062,BOOK II.,"""Give order, Saint, with watchful heed"
10063,BOOK II.,For what the coming rite will need.
10064,BOOK II.,This day let all things ready wait
10065,BOOK II.,"Mine eldest son to consecrate."""
10066,BOOK II.,Best of all men of second birth
10067,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha heard the lord of earth,"
10068,BOOK II.,And gave commandment to the bands
10069,BOOK II.,Of servitors with lifted hands
10070,BOOK II.,Who waited on their master's eye:
10071,BOOK II.,"""Now by to-morrow's dawn supply"
10072,BOOK II.,Rich gold and herbs and gems of price
10073,BOOK II.,"And offerings for the sacrifice,"
10074,BOOK II.,"Wreaths of white flowers and roasted rice,"
10075,BOOK II.,"And oil and honey, separate;"
10076,BOOK II.,"New garments and a car of state,"
10077,BOOK II.,"An elephant with lucky signs,"
10078,BOOK II.,"A fourfold host in ordered lines,"
10079,BOOK II.,"The white umbrella, and a pair"
10080,BOOK II.,"Of chowries,(261) and a banner fair;"
10081,BOOK II.,"A hundred vases, row on row,"
10082,BOOK II.,"To shine like fire in splendid glow,"
10083,BOOK II.,"A tiger's mighty skin, a bull"
10084,BOOK II.,With gilded horns most beautiful.
10085,BOOK II.,"All these, at dawn of coming day,"
10086,BOOK II.,"Around the royal shrine array,"
10087,BOOK II.,Where burns the fire's undying ray.
10088,BOOK II.,"Each palace door, each city gate"
10089,BOOK II.,With wreaths of sandal decorate.
10090,BOOK II.,And with the garlands' fragrant scent
10091,BOOK II.,Let clouds of incense-smoke be blent.
10092,BOOK II.,Let food of noble kind and taste
10093,BOOK II.,Be for a hundred thousand placed;
10094,BOOK II.,Fresh curds with streams of milk bedewed
10095,BOOK II.,To feed the Bráhman multitude.
10096,BOOK II.,With care be all their wants supplied.
10097,BOOK II.,And mid the twice-born chiefs divide
10098,BOOK II.,"Rich largess, with the early morn,"
10099,BOOK II.,And oil and curds and roasted corn.
10100,BOOK II.,Soon as the sun has shown his light
10101,BOOK II.,"Pronounce the prayer to bless the rite,"
10102,BOOK II.,And then be all the Bráhmans called
10103,BOOK II.,And in their ordered seats installed.
10104,BOOK II.,"Let all musicians skilled to play,"
10105,BOOK II.,And dancing-girls in bright array
10106,BOOK II.,Stand ready in the second ring
10107,BOOK II.,Within the palace of the king.
10108,BOOK II.,"Each honoured tree, each holy shrine"
10109,BOOK II.,"With leaves and flowery wreaths entwine,"
10110,BOOK II.,And here and there beneath the shade
10111,BOOK II.,Be food prepared and presents laid.
10112,BOOK II.,"Then brightly clad, in warlike guise,"
10113,BOOK II.,"With long swords girt upon their thighs,"
10114,BOOK II.,Let soldiers of the nobler sort
10115,BOOK II.,"March to the monarch's splendid court."""
10116,BOOK II.,
10117,BOOK II.,Thus gave command the twice-born pair
10118,BOOK II.,To active servants stationed there.
10119,BOOK II.,Then hastened to the king and said
10120,BOOK II.,"That all their task was duly sped,"
10121,BOOK II.,The king to wise Sumantra spake:
10122,BOOK II.,"""Now quick, my lord, thy chariot take,"
10123,BOOK II.,And hither with thy swiftest speed
10124,BOOK II.,"My son, my noble Ráma lead."""
10125,BOOK II.,
10126,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, ere the word was given,"
10127,BOOK II.,"His chariot from the court had driven,"
10128,BOOK II.,"And Ráma, best of all who ride"
10129,BOOK II.,"In cars, came sitting by his side."
10130,BOOK II.,The lords of men had hastened forth
10131,BOOK II.,"From east and west and south and north,"
10132,BOOK II.,"Áryan and stranger, those who dwell"
10133,BOOK II.,"In the wild wood and on the fell,"
10134,BOOK II.,"And as the Gods to Indra, they"
10135,BOOK II.,Showed honour to the king that day.
10136,BOOK II.,
10137,BOOK II.,"Like Vásav, when his glorious form"
10138,BOOK II.,"Is circled by the Gods of storm,"
10139,BOOK II.,Girt in his hall by kings he saw
10140,BOOK II.,"His car-borne Ráma near him draw,"
10141,BOOK II.,Like him who rules the minstrel band
10142,BOOK II.,"Of heaven;(262) whose valour filled the land,"
10143,BOOK II.,Of mighty arm and stately pride
10144,BOOK II.,"Like a wild elephant in stride,"
10145,BOOK II.,As fair in face as that fair stone
10146,BOOK II.,"Dear to the moon, of moonbeams grown,(263)"
10147,BOOK II.,With noble gifts and grace that took
10148,BOOK II.,"The hearts of all, and chained each look,"
10149,BOOK II.,World-cheering as the Lord of Rain
10150,BOOK II.,When floods relieve the parching plain.
10151,BOOK II.,"The father, as the son came nigh,"
10152,BOOK II.,Gazed with an ever-thirstier eye.
10153,BOOK II.,Sumantra helped the prince alight
10154,BOOK II.,"From the good chariot passing bright,"
10155,BOOK II.,And as to meet his sire he went
10156,BOOK II.,Followed behind him reverent.
10157,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma clomb, the king to seek"
10158,BOOK II.,"That terrace like Kailása's peak,"
10159,BOOK II.,"And reached the presence of the king,"
10160,BOOK II.,Sumantra closely following.
10161,BOOK II.,"Before his father's face he came,"
10162,BOOK II.,"Raised suppliant hands and named his name,(264)"
10163,BOOK II.,And bowing lowly as is meet
10164,BOOK II.,Paid reverence to the monarch's feet.
10165,BOOK II.,But soon as Dasaratha viewed
10166,BOOK II.,"The prince in humble attitude,"
10167,BOOK II.,He raised him by the hand in haste
10168,BOOK II.,"And his beloved son embraced,"
10169,BOOK II.,"Then signed him to a glorious throne,"
10170,BOOK II.,"Gem-decked and golden, near his own."
10171,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, best of Raghu's line,"
10172,BOOK II.,Made the fair seat with lustre shine
10173,BOOK II.,As when the orient sun upsprings
10174,BOOK II.,And his pure beam on Meru flings.
10175,BOOK II.,"The glory flashed on roof and wall,"
10176,BOOK II.,"And with strange sheen suffused the hall,"
10177,BOOK II.,As when the moon's pure rays are sent
10178,BOOK II.,Through autumn's star-lit firmament.
10179,BOOK II.,Then swelled his breast with joy and pride
10180,BOOK II.,"As his dear son the father eyed,"
10181,BOOK II.,E'en as himself more fair arrayed
10182,BOOK II.,In some clear mirror's face displayed.
10183,BOOK II.,"The aged monarch gazed awhile,"
10184,BOOK II.,"Then thus addressed him with a smile,"
10185,BOOK II.,"As Kasyap, whom the worlds revere,"
10186,BOOK II.,Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:
10187,BOOK II.,"""O thou of all my sons most dear,"
10188,BOOK II.,"In virtue best, thy father's peer,"
10189,BOOK II.,"Child of my consort first in place,"
10190,BOOK II.,"Mine equal in her pride of race,"
10191,BOOK II.,Because the people's hearts are bound
10192,BOOK II.,"To thee by graces in thee found,"
10193,BOOK II.,Be thou in Pushya's favouring hour
10194,BOOK II.,Made partner of my royal power.
10195,BOOK II.,I know that thou by nature's bent
10196,BOOK II.,"Both modest art and excellent,"
10197,BOOK II.,But though thy gifts no counsel need
10198,BOOK II.,My love suggests the friendly rede.
10199,BOOK II.,"Mine own dear son, be modest still,"
10200,BOOK II.,And rule each sense with earnest will.
10201,BOOK II.,Keep thou the evils far away
10202,BOOK II.,That spring from love and anger's sway.
10203,BOOK II.,Thy noble course alike pursue
10204,BOOK II.,"In secret as in open view,"
10205,BOOK II.,"And every nerve, the love to gain"
10206,BOOK II.,"Of ministers and subjects, strain."
10207,BOOK II.,The happy prince who sees with pride
10208,BOOK II.,His thriving people satisfied;
10209,BOOK II.,"Whose arsenals with arms are stored,"
10210,BOOK II.,"And treasury with golden hoard,--"
10211,BOOK II.,His friends rejoice as joyed the Blest
10212,BOOK II.,When Amrit crowned their eager quest.
10213,BOOK II.,"So well, my child, thy course maintain,"
10214,BOOK II.,"And from all ill thy soul refrain."""
10215,BOOK II.,
10216,BOOK II.,"The friends of Ráma, gathered nigh,"
10217,BOOK II.,"Longing their lord to gratify,"
10218,BOOK II.,Ran to Kausalyá's bower to tell
10219,BOOK II.,The tidings that would please her well.
10220,BOOK II.,"She, host of dames, with many a gem,"
10221,BOOK II.,"And gold, and kine rewarded them."
10222,BOOK II.,
10223,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma paid the reverence due,"
10224,BOOK II.,"Mounted the chariot, and withdrew,"
10225,BOOK II.,And to his splendid dwelling drove
10226,BOOK II.,While crowds to show him honour strove.
10227,BOOK II.,"The people, when the monarch's speech"
10228,BOOK II.,"Their willing ears had heard,"
10229,BOOK II.,Were wild with joy as though on each
10230,BOOK II.,Great gifts had been conferred.
10231,BOOK II.,With meek and low salute each man
10232,BOOK II.,"Turned to his home away,"
10233,BOOK II.,And there with happy heart began
10234,BOOK II.,To all the Gods to pray.

10241,BOOK II.,
10242,BOOK II.,"The crowd dismissed, to high debate"
10243,BOOK II.,"The monarch called his peers of state,"
10244,BOOK II.,"And, counsel from their lips obtained,"
10245,BOOK II.,Firm in his will his will explained:
10246,BOOK II.,"""To-morrow with auspicious ray"
10247,BOOK II.,The moon in Pushya's sign will stay;
10248,BOOK II.,Be that the time with happy fate
10249,BOOK II.,"Mine eldest son to consecrate,"
10250,BOOK II.,"And let my Ráma, lotus-eyed,"
10251,BOOK II.,"As Regent o'er the state preside."""
10252,BOOK II.,
10253,BOOK II.,"He sought, within, his charioteer,"
10254,BOOK II.,"And cried ""Again bring Ráma here."""
10255,BOOK II.,To Ráma's home Sumantra hied
10256,BOOK II.,Again to be the prince's guide.
10257,BOOK II.,"His coming, told to Ráma's ear,"
10258,BOOK II.,Suggested anxious doubt and fear.
10259,BOOK II.,He bade the messenger be led
10260,BOOK II.,"That instant in, and thus he said:"
10261,BOOK II.,"""Tell me the cause, omitting naught,"
10262,BOOK II.,"Why thou again my house hast sought."""
10263,BOOK II.,
10264,BOOK II.,"The envoy answered: ""Prince, thy sire"

10266,BOOK II.,"My sender known, 'tis thine to say"
10267,BOOK II.,"If thou wilt go or answer nay."""
10268,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, when he heard his speech,"
10269,BOOK II.,Made haste the royal court to reach.
10270,BOOK II.,Soon as the monarch was aware
10271,BOOK II.,"His dearest son was waiting there,"
10272,BOOK II.,Eager the parley to begin
10273,BOOK II.,"He bade them lead the prince within,"
10274,BOOK II.,Soon as he passed the chamber door
10275,BOOK II.,"The hero bent him to the floor,"
10276,BOOK II.,And at a distance from his seat
10277,BOOK II.,Raised his joined hands his sire to greet.
10278,BOOK II.,"The monarch raised him from the ground,"
10279,BOOK II.,"And loving arms about him wound,"
10280,BOOK II.,Then pointed to a seat that shone
10281,BOOK II.,With gold for him to rest upon.
10282,BOOK II.,"""Aged am I,"" he said, ""and worn;"
10283,BOOK II.,In life's best joys my share have borne;
10284,BOOK II.,"Rites to the Gods, in hundreds, paid,"

10286,BOOK II.,I yearned for sons: my life is blest

10288,BOOK II.,"No debt to saints or Bráhmans, no,"
10289,BOOK II.,"Nor spirits, Gods, or self I owe."
10290,BOOK II.,"One duty now remains alone,"
10291,BOOK II.,To set thee on thy father's throne.
10292,BOOK II.,"Now therefore, Ráma, hear my rede,"
10293,BOOK II.,And mark my words with duteous heed:
10294,BOOK II.,"This day the peoples' general voice,"
10295,BOOK II.,"Elects thee king of love and choice,"
10296,BOOK II.,"And I, consenting to the prayer,"
10297,BOOK II.,"Will make thee, darling, Regent Heir."
10298,BOOK II.,"Dread visions, each returning night,"
10299,BOOK II.,With evil omens scare my sight.
10300,BOOK II.,Red meteors with a fearful sound
10301,BOOK II.,"Shoot wildly downward to the ground,"
10302,BOOK II.,While tempests lash the troubled air;
10303,BOOK II.,And they who read the stars declare
10304,BOOK II.,"That, leagued against my natal sign,"
10305,BOOK II.,"Ráhu,(265) the Sun,(266) and Mars combine."
10306,BOOK II.,"When portents dire as these appear,"

10322,BOOK II.,"From worldly thoughts thy soul refrain,"
10323,BOOK II.,And couched on holy grass remain.
10324,BOOK II.,And let thy trusted lords attend

10326,BOOK II.,"For, unexpected, check and bar"
10327,BOOK II.,Our weightiest counsels often mar.
10328,BOOK II.,While Bharat too is far away
10329,BOOK II.,"Making with royal kin his stay,"
10330,BOOK II.,I deem the fittest time of all
10331,BOOK II.,"Thee, chosen Regent, to install."
10332,BOOK II.,It may be Bharat still has stood
10333,BOOK II.,"True to the counsels of the good,"
10334,BOOK II.,"Faithful to thee with tender trust,"

10336,BOOK II.,"But human minds, too well I know,"
10337,BOOK II.,"Will sudden changes undergo,"
10338,BOOK II.,And by their constant deeds alone
10339,BOOK II.,The virtue of the good is shown.
10340,BOOK II.,"Now, Ráma, go. My son, good night!"
10341,BOOK II.,"Fixt is to-morrow for the rite."""
10342,BOOK II.,
10343,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma paid the reverence due,"
10344,BOOK II.,And quickly to his home withdrew.
10345,BOOK II.,"He passed within, nor lingered there,"
10346,BOOK II.,"But sought his mother's mansion, where"
10347,BOOK II.,The dame in linen robes arrayed
10348,BOOK II.,Devoutly in the chapel prayed
10349,BOOK II.,"To Fortune's Queen, with utterance checked,"
10350,BOOK II.,That she her Ráma would protect.
10351,BOOK II.,"There was Sumitrá too, and there"
10352,BOOK II.,Was Lakshman led by loving care:
10353,BOOK II.,And when the royal choice they knew
10354,BOOK II.,Sítá in haste was summoned too.
10355,BOOK II.,"Absorbed, with half-shut eyes, the queen"
10356,BOOK II.,Attended by the three was seen.
10357,BOOK II.,She knew that Pushya's lucky hour
10358,BOOK II.,"Would raise her son to royal power,"
10359,BOOK II.,So fixed with bated breath each thought
10360,BOOK II.,"On God supreme, by all men sought."
10361,BOOK II.,"To her, as thus she knelt and prayed,"
10362,BOOK II.,"Ráma drew near, due reverence paid,"
10363,BOOK II.,"And then to swell his mother's joy,"
10364,BOOK II.,Thus spoke her own beloved boy;
10365,BOOK II.,"""O mother dear, my sire's decree"
10366,BOOK II.,Entrusts the people's weal to me.
10367,BOOK II.,"To-morrow I, for so his will,"
10368,BOOK II.,"Anointed king, the throne shall fill."
10369,BOOK II.,The few last hours till night shall end
10370,BOOK II.,"Sítá with me must fasting spend,"
10371,BOOK II.,"For so my father has decreed,"
10372,BOOK II.,And holy priests with him agreed.
10373,BOOK II.,What vows soever thou mayst deem
10374,BOOK II.,"My consecration's eve beseem,"
10375,BOOK II.,"Do thou, sweet mother, for my sake"
10376,BOOK II.,"And for beloved Sítá's make."""
10377,BOOK II.,
10378,BOOK II.,"When the glad news Kausalyá heard,"
10379,BOOK II.,"So long desired, so long deferred,"
10380,BOOK II.,"While tears of joy her utterance broke,"
10381,BOOK II.,In answer to her son she spoke:
10382,BOOK II.,"""Long be thy life, my darling: now"
10383,BOOK II.,Thy prostrate foes before thee bow.
10384,BOOK II.,Live long and with thy bright success
10385,BOOK II.,My friends and dear Sumitrá's bless.
10386,BOOK II.,Surely the stars were wondrous fair
10387,BOOK II.,"When thee, sweet son, thy mother bare,"
10388,BOOK II.,That thy good gifts such love inspire
10389,BOOK II.,And win the favour of thy sire.
10390,BOOK II.,With thee I travailed not in vain;
10391,BOOK II.,"Those lotus eyes reward my pain,"
10392,BOOK II.,And all the glory of the line
10393,BOOK II.,"Of old Ikshváku will be thine."""
10394,BOOK II.,
10395,BOOK II.,"He smiled, and on his brother gazed"
10396,BOOK II.,"Who sate with reverent hands upraised,"
10397,BOOK II.,"And said: ""My brother, thou must be"
10398,BOOK II.,Joint-ruler of this land with me.
10399,BOOK II.,"My second self thou, Lakshman, art,"
10400,BOOK II.,And in my fortune bearest part.
10401,BOOK II.,"Be thine, Sumitrá's son, to know"
10402,BOOK II.,The joys from regal power that flow.
10403,BOOK II.,"My life itself, the monarch's seat,"
10404,BOOK II.,"For thy dear sake to me are sweet."""
10405,BOOK II.,
10406,BOOK II.,"Thus Ráma to his brother said,"
10407,BOOK II.,"To both his mothers(268) bowed his head,"
10408,BOOK II.,And then with Sítá by his side
10409,BOOK II.,To his own house the hero hied.

10414,BOOK II.,Canto V. Ráma's Fast.
10415,BOOK II.,
10416,BOOK II.,
10417,BOOK II.,Then Saint Vasishtha to the king
10418,BOOK II.,Came ready at his summoning.
10419,BOOK II.,"""Now go,"" exclaimed the monarch, ""thou"
10420,BOOK II.,"Enriched by fervent rite and vow,"
10421,BOOK II.,For Ráma and his wife ordain
10422,BOOK II.,"The fast, that joy may bless his reign."""
10423,BOOK II.,
10424,BOOK II.,The best of those who Scripture know
10425,BOOK II.,"Said to the king, ""My lord, I go."""
10426,BOOK II.,"To Ráma's house Vasishtha hied,"
10427,BOOK II.,"The hero's fast by rule to guide,"
10428,BOOK II.,And skilled in sacred texts to tell
10429,BOOK II.,Each step to him instructed well.
10430,BOOK II.,"Straight to Prince Ráma's high abode,"
10431,BOOK II.,"That like a cloud pale-tinted showed,"
10432,BOOK II.,Borne in his priestly car he rode.
10433,BOOK II.,"Two courts he passed, and in the third"
10434,BOOK II.,He stayed his car. Then Ráma heard
10435,BOOK II.,"The holy sage was come, and flew"
10436,BOOK II.,To honour him with honour due.
10437,BOOK II.,He hastened to the car and lent
10438,BOOK II.,His hand to aid the priest's descent.
10439,BOOK II.,"Then spoke Vasishtha words like these,"
10440,BOOK II.,"Pleased with his reverent courtesies,"
10441,BOOK II.,With pleasant things his heart to cheer
10442,BOOK II.,Who best deserved glad news to hear:
10443,BOOK II.,"""Prince, thou hast won thy father's grace,"
10444,BOOK II.,And thine will be the Regent's place:
10445,BOOK II.,"Now with thy Sítá, as is right,"
10446,BOOK II.,"In strictest fasting spend the night,"
10447,BOOK II.,For when the morrow's dawn is fair
10448,BOOK II.,The king will consecrate his heir:
10449,BOOK II.,"So Nahush,(269) as the wise relate,"
10450,BOOK II.,"Yayáti joyed to consecrate."""
10451,BOOK II.,
10452,BOOK II.,"Thus having said, Vasishtha next"
10453,BOOK II.,"Ordained the fast by rule and text,"
10454,BOOK II.,For Ráma faithful to his vows
10455,BOOK II.,And the Videhan dame his spouse.
10456,BOOK II.,Then from the prince's house he hied
10457,BOOK II.,With courteous honours gratified.
10458,BOOK II.,Round Ráma gathered every friend
10459,BOOK II.,In pleasant talk a while to spend.
10460,BOOK II.,"He bade good night to all at last,"
10461,BOOK II.,And to his inner chamber passed.
10462,BOOK II.,Then Ráma's house shone bright and gay
10463,BOOK II.,"With men and maids in glad array,"
10464,BOOK II.,As in the morning some fair lake
10465,BOOK II.,"When all her lotuses awake,"
10466,BOOK II.,And every bird that loves the flood
10467,BOOK II.,Flits joyous round each opening bud.
10468,BOOK II.,
10469,BOOK II.,"Forth from the house Vasishtha drove,"
10470,BOOK II.,"That with the king's in splendour strove,"
10471,BOOK II.,And all the royal street he viewed
10472,BOOK II.,Filled with a mighty multitude
10473,BOOK II.,"The eager concourse blocked each square,"
10474,BOOK II.,"Each road and lane and thoroughfare,"
10475,BOOK II.,And joyous shouts on every side
10476,BOOK II.,"Rose like the roar of Ocean's tide,"
10477,BOOK II.,As streams of men together came
10478,BOOK II.,With loud huzza and glad acclaim.
10479,BOOK II.,"The ways were watered, swept and clean,"
10480,BOOK II.,And decked with flowers and garlands green
10481,BOOK II.,And all Ayodhyá shone arrayed
10482,BOOK II.,With banners on the roofs that played.
10483,BOOK II.,"Men, women, boys with eager eyes,"
10484,BOOK II.,"Expecting when the sun should rise,"
10485,BOOK II.,Stood longing for the herald ray
10486,BOOK II.,"Of Ráma's consecration day,"
10487,BOOK II.,"To see, a source of joy to all,"
10488,BOOK II.,The people-honoured festival.
10489,BOOK II.,
10490,BOOK II.,The priest advancing slowly through
10491,BOOK II.,"The mighty crowd he cleft in two,"
10492,BOOK II.,Near to the monarch's palace drew.
10493,BOOK II.,"He sought the terrace, by the stair,"
10494,BOOK II.,"Like a white cloud-peak high in air,"
10495,BOOK II.,The reverend king of men to meet
10496,BOOK II.,Who sate upon his splendid seat:
10497,BOOK II.,Thus will Vrihaspati arise
10498,BOOK II.,To meet the monarch of the skies.
10499,BOOK II.,"But when the king his coming knew,"
10500,BOOK II.,He left his throne and near him drew
10501,BOOK II.,Questioned by him Vasishtha said
10502,BOOK II.,That all his task was duly sped.
10503,BOOK II.,"Then all who sate there, honouring"
10504,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha, rose as rose the king."
10505,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha bade his lord adieu,"
10506,BOOK II.,"And all the peers, dismissed, withdrew."
10507,BOOK II.,Then as a royal lion seeks
10508,BOOK II.,"His cave beneath the rocky peaks,"
10509,BOOK II.,So to the chambers where abode
10510,BOOK II.,His consorts Dasaratha strode.
10511,BOOK II.,Full-thronged were those delightful bowers
10512,BOOK II.,"With women richly dressed,"
10513,BOOK II.,And splendid as the radiant towers
10514,BOOK II.,Where Indra loves to rest.
10515,BOOK II.,Then brighter flashed a thousand eyes
10516,BOOK II.,"With the light his presence lent,"
10517,BOOK II.,"As, when the moon begins to rise"
10518,BOOK II.,The star thronged firmament.

10522,BOOK II.,
10523,BOOK II.,Canto VI. The City Decorated.
10524,BOOK II.,
10525,BOOK II.,
10526,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma bathed in order due,"
10527,BOOK II.,"His mind from worldly thoughts withdrew,"
10528,BOOK II.,And with his large-eyed wife besought
10529,BOOK II.,"Náráyan, as a votary ought."
10530,BOOK II.,Upon his head the brimming cup
10531,BOOK II.,"Of holy oil he lifted up,"
10532,BOOK II.,Then placed within the kindled fire
10533,BOOK II.,"The offering to that heavenly Sire,"
10534,BOOK II.,And as he sipped the remnant prayed
10535,BOOK II.,To Him for blessing and for aid.
10536,BOOK II.,Then with still lips and tranquil mind
10537,BOOK II.,"With his Videhan he reclined,"
10538,BOOK II.,"In Vishnu's chapel, on a bed"
10539,BOOK II.,"Where holy grass was duly spread,"
10540,BOOK II.,While still the prince's every thought
10541,BOOK II.,"The God supreme, Náráyan, sought."
10542,BOOK II.,One watch remained the night to close
10543,BOOK II.,"When Ráma from his couch arose,"
10544,BOOK II.,And bade the men and maids adorn
10545,BOOK II.,His palace for the solemn morn.
10546,BOOK II.,He heard the bards and heralds raise
10547,BOOK II.,Auspicious strains of joy and praise;
10548,BOOK II.,"And breathed devout, with voice restrained,"
10549,BOOK II.,The hymn for morning rites ordained;
10550,BOOK II.,"Then, with his head in reverence bowed,"
10551,BOOK II.,"Praised Madhu's conquering foe aloud,"
10552,BOOK II.,"And, in pure linen robes arrayed,"
10553,BOOK II.,The priests to raise their voices prayed.
10554,BOOK II.,Obedient to the summons they
10555,BOOK II.,Proclaimed to all the festal day.
10556,BOOK II.,"The Bráhmans' voices, deep and sweet,"
10557,BOOK II.,"Resounded through the crowded street,"
10558,BOOK II.,And echoed through Ayodhyá went
10559,BOOK II.,By many a loud-toned instrument.
10560,BOOK II.,Then all the people joyed to hear
10561,BOOK II.,That Ráma with his consort dear
10562,BOOK II.,Had fasted till the morning light
10563,BOOK II.,In preparation for the rite.
10564,BOOK II.,Swiftly the joyful tidings through
10565,BOOK II.,"Ayodhyá's crowded city flew,"
10566,BOOK II.,"And soon as dawn appeared, each man"
10567,BOOK II.,To decorate the town began.
10568,BOOK II.,In all the temples bright and fair
10569,BOOK II.,"As white clouds towering in the air,"
10570,BOOK II.,"In streets, and where the cross-ways met,"
10571,BOOK II.,"Where holy fig-trees had been set,"
10572,BOOK II.,"In open square, in sacred shade,"
10573,BOOK II.,"Where merchants' shops their wealth displayed,"
10574,BOOK II.,"On all the mansions of the great,"
10575,BOOK II.,"And householders of wealth and state,"
10576,BOOK II.,"Where'er the people loved to meet,"
10577,BOOK II.,"Where'er a tree adorned the street,"
10578,BOOK II.,"Gay banners floated to the wind,"
10579,BOOK II.,And ribands round the staves were twined.
10580,BOOK II.,"Then clear the singers' voices rang,"
10581,BOOK II.,"As, charming mind and ear, they sang."
10582,BOOK II.,"Here players shone in bright attire,"
10583,BOOK II.,There dancing women swelled the quire.
10584,BOOK II.,Each with his friend had much to say
10585,BOOK II.,Of Ráma's consecration-day:
10586,BOOK II.,"Yea, even children, as they played"
10587,BOOK II.,At cottage doors beneath the shade.
10588,BOOK II.,The royal street with flowers was strown
10589,BOOK II.,"Which loving hands in heaps had thrown,"
10590,BOOK II.,And here and there rich incense lent
10591,BOOK II.,Its fragrance to the garland's scent;
10592,BOOK II.,And all was fresh and fair and bright
10593,BOOK II.,In honour of the coming rite.
10594,BOOK II.,With careful foresight to illume
10595,BOOK II.,"With borrowed blaze the midnight gloom,"
10596,BOOK II.,The crowds erected here and there
10597,BOOK II.,Trees in each street gay lamps to bear.
10598,BOOK II.,The city thus from side to side
10599,BOOK II.,In festal guise was beautified.
10600,BOOK II.,The people of the town who longed
10601,BOOK II.,"To view the rite together thronged,"
10602,BOOK II.,And filling every court and square
10603,BOOK II.,Praised the good king in converse there:
10604,BOOK II.,"""Our high-souled king! He throws a grace"
10605,BOOK II.,On old Ikshváku's royal race.
10606,BOOK II.,"He feels his years' increasing weight,"
10607,BOOK II.,And makes his son associate.
10608,BOOK II.,Great joy to us the choice will bring
10609,BOOK II.,Of Ráma for our lord and king.
10610,BOOK II.,"The good and bad to him are known,"
10611,BOOK II.,And long will he protect his own.
10612,BOOK II.,"No pride his prudent breast may swell,"
10613,BOOK II.,"Most just, he loves his brothers well,"
10614,BOOK II.,"And to us all that love extends,"
10615,BOOK II.,Cherished as brothers and as friends.
10616,BOOK II.,"Long may our lord in life remain,"
10617,BOOK II.,"Good Dasaratha, free from stain,"
10618,BOOK II.,By whose most gracious favour we
10619,BOOK II.,"Ráma anointed king shall see."""
10620,BOOK II.,
10621,BOOK II.,Such were the words the townsmen spoke
10622,BOOK II.,"Heard by the gathering countryfolk,"
10623,BOOK II.,"Who from the south, north, east, and west,"
10624,BOOK II.,"Stirred by the joyful tidings, pressed."
10625,BOOK II.,For by their eager longing led
10626,BOOK II.,To Ráma's consecration sped
10627,BOOK II.,"The villagers from every side,"
10628,BOOK II.,And filled Ayodhyá's city wide.
10629,BOOK II.,"This way and that way strayed the crowd,"
10630,BOOK II.,"While rose a murmur long and loud,"
10631,BOOK II.,As when the full moon floods the skies
10632,BOOK II.,And Ocean's waves with thunder rise.
10633,BOOK II.,"That town, like Indra's city fair,"
10634,BOOK II.,"While peasants thronged her ways,"
10635,BOOK II.,"Tumultuous roared like Ocean, where"

10646,BOOK II.,Mounted the stair and stood upon
10647,BOOK II.,The terrace like the moon that shone.
10648,BOOK II.,Thence Manthará at ease surveyed
10649,BOOK II.,"Ayodhyá to her eyes displayed,"
10650,BOOK II.,"Where water cooled the royal street,"
10651,BOOK II.,"Where heaps of flowers were fresh and sweet,"
10652,BOOK II.,And costly flags and pennons hung
10653,BOOK II.,On roof and tower their shadow flung;
10654,BOOK II.,"With covered ways prepared in haste,"
10655,BOOK II.,And many an awning newly placed;
10656,BOOK II.,"With sandal-scented streams bedewed,"
10657,BOOK II.,Thronged by a new bathed multitude:
10658,BOOK II.,Whose streets were full of Bráhman bands
10659,BOOK II.,With wreaths and sweetmeats in their hands.
10660,BOOK II.,"Loud instruments their music raised,"
10661,BOOK II.,"And through the town, where'er she gazed,"
10662,BOOK II.,"The doors of temples glittered white,"
10663,BOOK II.,And the maid marvelled at the sight.
10664,BOOK II.,
10665,BOOK II.,"Of Ráma's nurse who, standing by,"
10666,BOOK II.,"Gazed with a joy-expanded eye,"
10667,BOOK II.,"In robes of purest white attired,"
10668,BOOK II.,The wondering damsel thus inquired:
10669,BOOK II.,
10670,BOOK II.,"""Does Ráma's mother give away"
10671,BOOK II.,"Rich largess to the crowds to-day,"
10672,BOOK II.,"On some dear object fondly bent,"
10673,BOOK II.,Or blest with measureless content?
10674,BOOK II.,What mean these signs of rare delight
10675,BOOK II.,On every side that meet my sight?
10676,BOOK II.,"Say, will the king with joy elate"
10677,BOOK II.,"Some happy triumph celebrate?"""
10678,BOOK II.,
10679,BOOK II.,"The nurse, with transport uncontrolled,"
10680,BOOK II.,Her glad tale to the hump-back told:
10681,BOOK II.,"""Our lord the king to-morrow morn"
10682,BOOK II.,"Will consecrate his eldest-born,"
10683,BOOK II.,"And raise, in Pushya's favouring hour,"
10684,BOOK II.,"Prince Ráma to the royal power."""
10685,BOOK II.,"As thus the nurse her tidings spoke,"
10686,BOOK II.,Rage in the hump-back's breast awoke.
10687,BOOK II.,"Down from the terrace, like the head"
10688,BOOK II.,"Of high Kailása's hill, she sped."
10689,BOOK II.,"Sin in her thoughts, her soul aflame,"
10690,BOOK II.,"Where Queen Kaikeyí slept, she came:"
10691,BOOK II.,"""Why sleepest thou?"" she cried, ""arise,"

10693,BOOK II.,"Ah, heedless Queen, too blind to know"
10694,BOOK II.,What floods of sin above thee flow!
10695,BOOK II.,Thy boasts of love and grace are o'er:
10696,BOOK II.,Thine is the show and nothing more.
10697,BOOK II.,"His favour is an empty cheat,"
10698,BOOK II.,"A torrent dried by summer's heat."""
10699,BOOK II.,
10700,BOOK II.,Thus by the artful maid addressed
10701,BOOK II.,"In cruel words from raging breast,"
10702,BOOK II.,"The queen, sore troubled, spoke in turn;"
10703,BOOK II.,"""What evil news have I to learn?"
10704,BOOK II.,"That mournful eye, that altered cheek"
10705,BOOK II.,"Of sudden woe or danger speak."""
10706,BOOK II.,
10707,BOOK II.,Such were the words Kaikeyí said:
10708,BOOK II.,"Then Manthará, her eyeballs red"
10709,BOOK II.,"With fury, skilled with treacherous art"
10710,BOOK II.,"To grieve yet more her lady's heart,"

10751,BOOK II.,"Ah, simple lady, long beguiled"
10752,BOOK II.,By his soft words who falsely smiled!
10753,BOOK II.,"Poor victim of the guileless breast,"
10754,BOOK II.,A happier fate thou meritest.
10755,BOOK II.,For thee and thine destruction waits
10756,BOOK II.,When he Prince Ráma consecrates.
10757,BOOK II.,"Up, lady, while there yet is time;"
10758,BOOK II.,"Preserve thyself, prevent the crime."
10759,BOOK II.,"Up, from thy careless ease, and free"

10761,BOOK II.,
10762,BOOK II.,"Delighted at the words she said,"
10763,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí lifted from the bed,"
10764,BOOK II.,"Like autumn's moon, her radiant head,"
10765,BOOK II.,And joyous at the tidings gave
10766,BOOK II.,A jewel to the hump-back slave;
10767,BOOK II.,And as she gave the precious toy
10768,BOOK II.,She cried in her exceeding joy:
10769,BOOK II.,"""Take this, dear maiden, for thy news"
10770,BOOK II.,"Most grateful to mine ear, and choose"
10771,BOOK II.,What grace beside most fitly may
10772,BOOK II.,The welcome messenger repay.
10773,BOOK II.,I joy that Ráma gains the throne:

10783,BOOK II.,"She answered, as the gift she spurned:"
10784,BOOK II.,"""What time, O simple Queen, is this"
10785,BOOK II.,For idle dreams of fancied bliss?
10786,BOOK II.,"Hast thou not sense thy state to know,"
10787,BOOK II.,Engulfed in seas of whelming woe;
10788,BOOK II.,Sick as I am with grief and pain
10789,BOOK II.,My lips can scarce a laugh restrain
10790,BOOK II.,To see thee hail with ill-timed joy
10791,BOOK II.,A peril mighty to destroy.
10792,BOOK II.,I mourn for one so fondly blind:
10793,BOOK II.,What woman of a prudent mind
10794,BOOK II.,"Would welcome, e'en as thou hast done,"
10795,BOOK II.,"The lordship of a rival's son,"
10796,BOOK II.,Rejoiced to find her secret foe
10797,BOOK II.,"Empowered, like death, to launch the blow;"
10798,BOOK II.,I see that Ráma still must fear
10799,BOOK II.,"Thy Bharat, to his throne too near."
10800,BOOK II.,"Hence is my heart disquieted,"
10801,BOOK II.,For those who fear are those we dread.
10802,BOOK II.,"Lakshman, the mighty bow who draws,"
10803,BOOK II.,With all his soul serves Ráma's cause;
10804,BOOK II.,And chains as strong to Bharat bind

10810,BOOK II.,"Yes, Queen, 'tis Ráma that I dread,"
10811,BOOK II.,"Wise, prompt, in warlike science bred;"
10812,BOOK II.,"And oh, I tremble when I think"
10813,BOOK II.,Of thy dear child on ruin's brink.
10814,BOOK II.,"Blest with a lofty fate is she,"
10815,BOOK II.,Kausalyá; for her son will be
10816,BOOK II.,"Placed, when the moon and Pushya meet,"

10826,BOOK II.,
10827,BOOK II.,"As thus the maid in wrath complained,"
10828,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí saw her heart was pained,"
10829,BOOK II.,And answered eager in defence
10830,BOOK II.,Of Ráma's worth and excellence:
10831,BOOK II.,"""Nay, Ráma, born the monarch's heir,"
10832,BOOK II.,"By holy fathers trained with care,"
10833,BOOK II.,"Virtuous, grateful, pure, and true,"
10834,BOOK II.,Claims royal sway as rightly due.
10835,BOOK II.,"He, like a sire, will long defend"
10836,BOOK II.,"Each brother, minister, and friend."
10837,BOOK II.,"Then why, O hump-back, art thou pained"
10838,BOOK II.,To hear that he the throne has gained?
10839,BOOK II.,"Be sure when Ráma's empire ends,"
10840,BOOK II.,"The kingdom to my son descends,"
10841,BOOK II.,"Who, when a hundred years are flown,"
10842,BOOK II.,Shall sit upon his fathers' throne.
10843,BOOK II.,Why is thine heart thus sad to see
10844,BOOK II.,"The joy that is and long shall be,"
10845,BOOK II.,This fortune by possession sure
10846,BOOK II.,And hopes which we may count secure?
10847,BOOK II.,Dear as the darling son I bore
10848,BOOK II.,"Is Ráma, yea, or even more."
10849,BOOK II.,"Most duteous to Kausalyá, he"
10850,BOOK II.,Is yet more dutiful to me.
10851,BOOK II.,"What though he rule, we need not fear:"
10852,BOOK II.,His brethren to his soul are dear.
10853,BOOK II.,And if the throne Prince Ráma fill
10854,BOOK II.,"Bharat will share the empire still."""
10855,BOOK II.,
10856,BOOK II.,She ceased. The troubled damsel sighed
10857,BOOK II.,"Sighs long and hot, and thus replied:"
10858,BOOK II.,"""What madness has possessed thy mind,"
10859,BOOK II.,"To warnings deaf, to dangers blind?"
10860,BOOK II.,Canst thou not see the floods of woe
10861,BOOK II.,That threaten o'er thine head to flow:
10862,BOOK II.,"First Ráma will the throne acquire,"
10863,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma's son succeed his sire,"
10864,BOOK II.,While Bharat will neglected pine
10865,BOOK II.,Excluded from the royal line.
10866,BOOK II.,"Not all his sons, O lady fair,"
10867,BOOK II.,The kingdom of a monarch share:
10868,BOOK II.,All ruling when a sovereign dies
10869,BOOK II.,Wild tumult in the state would rise.
10870,BOOK II.,"The eldest, be he good or ill,"
10871,BOOK II.,Is ruler by the father's will.
10872,BOOK II.,"Know, tender mother, that thy son"
10873,BOOK II.,"Without a friend and all undone,"
10874,BOOK II.,Far from the joyous ease of home
10875,BOOK II.,An alien from his race will roam.
10876,BOOK II.,"I sped to thee for whom I feel,"
10877,BOOK II.,"But thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,"
10878,BOOK II.,Thy hand a present would bestow
10879,BOOK II.,Because thy rival triumphs so.
10880,BOOK II.,When Ráma once begins his sway
10881,BOOK II.,"Without a foe his will to stay,"
10882,BOOK II.,Thy darling Bharat he will drive
10883,BOOK II.,To distant lands if left alive.
10884,BOOK II.,By thee the child was sent away
10885,BOOK II.,Beneath his grandsire's roof to stay.
10886,BOOK II.,Even in stocks and stones perforce
10887,BOOK II.,Will friendship spring from intercourse.
10888,BOOK II.,The young Satrughna too would go
10889,BOOK II.,"With Bharat, for he loved him so."
10890,BOOK II.,"As Lakshman still to Ráma cleaves,"
10891,BOOK II.,He his dear Bharat never leaves.
10892,BOOK II.,There is an ancient tale they tell:
10893,BOOK II.,A tree the foresters would fell
10894,BOOK II.,"Was saved by reeds that round it stood,"
10895,BOOK II.,For love that sprang of neighbourhood.
10896,BOOK II.,"So Lakshman Ráma will defend,"
10897,BOOK II.,And each on each for aid depend.
10898,BOOK II.,Such fame on earth their friendship wins
10899,BOOK II.,As that which binds the Heavenly Twins.
10900,BOOK II.,And Ráma ne'er will purpose wrong
10901,BOOK II.,"To Lakshman, for their love is strong."
10902,BOOK II.,"But Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,"
10903,BOOK II.,Must evil at his hands endure.
10904,BOOK II.,"Come, Ráma from his home expel"
10905,BOOK II.,An exile in the woods to dwell.
10906,BOOK II.,"The plan, O Queen, which I advise"
10907,BOOK II.,Secures thy weal if thou be wise.
10908,BOOK II.,So we and all thy kith and kin
10909,BOOK II.,Advantage from thy gain shall win.
10910,BOOK II.,"Shall Bharat, meet for happier fate,"
10911,BOOK II.,"Born to endure his rival's hate,"
10912,BOOK II.,With all his fortune ruined cower
10913,BOOK II.,And dread his brother's mightier power!
10914,BOOK II.,"Up, Queen, to save thy son, arise;"
10915,BOOK II.,Prostrate at Ráma's feet he lies.
10916,BOOK II.,So the proud elephant who leads
10917,BOOK II.,His trooping consorts through the reeds
10918,BOOK II.,Falls in the forest shade beneath
10919,BOOK II.,The lion's spring and murderous teeth.
10920,BOOK II.,Scorned by thee in thy bliss and pride

11063,BOOK II.,So round the lines of breast and limb.(271)
11064,BOOK II.,"Thy cheeks with moonlike beauty shine,"
11065,BOOK II.,And the warm wealth of youth is thine.
11066,BOOK II.,"Thy legs, my girl, are long and neat,"

11107,BOOK II.,And silence of the mourner's room.
11108,BOOK II.,The string of priceless pearls that hung
11109,BOOK II.,"Around her neck to earth she flung,"
11110,BOOK II.,With all the wealth and lustre lent
11111,BOOK II.,By precious gem and ornament.
11112,BOOK II.,"Then, listening to her slave's advice,"
11113,BOOK II.,"Lay, like a nymph from Paradise."
11114,BOOK II.,As on the ground her limbs she laid
11115,BOOK II.,Once more she cried unto the maid:
11116,BOOK II.,"""Soon must thou to the monarch say"
11117,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí's soul has past away,"
11118,BOOK II.,"Or, Ráma banished as we planned,"

11127,BOOK II.,Launched from the hump-back's tongue
11128,BOOK II.,"Pressed both her hands upon her side,"
11129,BOOK II.,And o'er and o'er again she cried
11130,BOOK II.,With wildering fury stung:
11131,BOOK II.,"""Yes, it shall be thy task to tell"

11161,BOOK II.,
11162,BOOK II.,As Queen Kaikeyí thus obeyed
11163,BOOK II.,The sinful counsel of her maid
11164,BOOK II.,"She sank upon the chamber floor,"
11165,BOOK II.,"As sinks in anguish, wounded sore,"
11166,BOOK II.,An elephant beneath the smart
11167,BOOK II.,Of the wild hunter's venomed dart.
11168,BOOK II.,The lovely lady in her mind
11169,BOOK II.,"Revolved the plot her maid designed,"
11170,BOOK II.,And prompt the gain and risk to scan
11171,BOOK II.,She step by step approved the plan.
11172,BOOK II.,Misguided by the hump-back's guile
11173,BOOK II.,"She pondered her resolve awhile,"
11174,BOOK II.,As the fair path that bliss secured
11175,BOOK II.,"The miserable lady lured,"
11176,BOOK II.,"Devoted to her queen, and swayed"
11177,BOOK II.,"By hopes of gain and bliss, the maid"
11178,BOOK II.,"Rejoiced, her lady's purpose known,"
11179,BOOK II.,And deemed the prize she sought her own.
11180,BOOK II.,"Then bent upon her purpose dire,"
11181,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí with her soul on fire,"
11182,BOOK II.,"Upon the floor lay, languid, down,"
11183,BOOK II.,Her brows contracted in a frown.
11184,BOOK II.,"The bright-hued wreath that bound her hair,"
11185,BOOK II.,"Chains, necklets, jewels rich and rare,"
11186,BOOK II.,Stripped off by her own fingers lay
11187,BOOK II.,"Spread on the ground in disarray,"
11188,BOOK II.,And to the floor a lustre lent
11189,BOOK II.,As stars light up the firmament.
11190,BOOK II.,"Thus prostrate in the mourner's cell,"
11191,BOOK II.,"In garb of woe the lady fell,"
11192,BOOK II.,"Her long hair in a single braid,"
11193,BOOK II.,Like some fair nymph of heaven dismayed.(272)
11194,BOOK II.,
11195,BOOK II.,"The monarch, Ráma to install,"
11196,BOOK II.,"With thoughtful care had ordered all,"
11197,BOOK II.,"And now within his home withdrew,"
11198,BOOK II.,Dismissing first his retinue.
11199,BOOK II.,"Now all the town has heard, thought he,"
11200,BOOK II.,What joyful rite the morn will see.
11201,BOOK II.,So turned he to her bower to cheer
11202,BOOK II.,With the glad news his darling's ear.
11203,BOOK II.,"Majestic, as the Lord of Night,"
11204,BOOK II.,"When threatened by the Dragon's might,"
11205,BOOK II.,Bursts radiant on the evening sky
11206,BOOK II.,"Pale with the clouds that wander by,"
11207,BOOK II.,"So Dasaratha, great in fame,"
11208,BOOK II.,To Queen Kaikeyí's palace came.
11209,BOOK II.,"There parrots flew from tree to tree,"
11210,BOOK II.,"And gorgeous peacocks wandered free,"
11211,BOOK II.,While ever and anon was heard
11212,BOOK II.,The note of some glad water-bird.
11213,BOOK II.,"Here loitered dwarf and hump-backed maid,"
11214,BOOK II.,There lute and lyre sweet music played.
11215,BOOK II.,"Here, rich in blossom, creepers twined"
11216,BOOK II.,"O'er grots with wondrous art designed,"
11217,BOOK II.,There Champac and Asoka flowers
11218,BOOK II.,"Hung glorious o'er the summer bowers,"
11219,BOOK II.,And mid the waving verdure rose
11220,BOOK II.,"Gold, silver, ivory porticoes."
11221,BOOK II.,Through all the months in ceaseless store
11222,BOOK II.,The trees both fruit and blossom bore.
11223,BOOK II.,With many a lake the grounds were graced;
11224,BOOK II.,"Seats gold and silver, here were placed;"
11225,BOOK II.,"Here every viand wooed the taste,"
11226,BOOK II.,It was a garden meet to vie
11227,BOOK II.,E'en with the home of Gods on high.
11228,BOOK II.,Within the mansion rich and vast
11229,BOOK II.,The mighty Dasaratha passed:
11230,BOOK II.,Not there was his beloved queen
11231,BOOK II.,On her fair couch reclining seen.
11232,BOOK II.,With love his eager pulses beat
11233,BOOK II.,"For the dear wife he came to meet,"
11234,BOOK II.,"And in his blissful hopes deceived,"
11235,BOOK II.,He sought his absent love and grieved.
11236,BOOK II.,For never had she missed the hour
11237,BOOK II.,"Of meeting in her sumptuous bower,"
11238,BOOK II.,And never had the king of men
11239,BOOK II.,Entered the empty room till then.
11240,BOOK II.,Still urged by love and anxious thought
11241,BOOK II.,"News of his favourite queen he sought,"
11242,BOOK II.,For never had his loving eyes
11243,BOOK II.,Found her or selfish or unwise.
11244,BOOK II.,"Then spoke at length the warder maid,"
11245,BOOK II.,With hands upraised and sore afraid:
11246,BOOK II.,"""My Lord and King, the queen has sought"
11247,BOOK II.,"The mourner's cell with rage distraught."""
11248,BOOK II.,
11249,BOOK II.,The words the warder maiden said
11250,BOOK II.,"He heard with soul disquieted,"
11251,BOOK II.,"And thus as fiercer grief assailed,"
11252,BOOK II.,His troubled senses wellnigh failed.
11253,BOOK II.,Consumed by torturing fires of grief
11254,BOOK II.,"The king, the world's imperial chief,"
11255,BOOK II.,His lady lying on the ground
11256,BOOK II.,"In most unqueenly posture, found."
11257,BOOK II.,"The aged king, all pure within,"
11258,BOOK II.,"Saw the young queen resolved on sin,"
11259,BOOK II.,"Low on the ground, his own sweet wife,"
11260,BOOK II.,"To him far dearer than his life,"
11261,BOOK II.,"Like some fair creeping plant uptorn,"
11262,BOOK II.,"Or like a maid of heaven forlorn,"
11263,BOOK II.,A nymph of air or Goddess sent
11264,BOOK II.,From Swarga down in banishment.
11265,BOOK II.,
11266,BOOK II.,As some wild elephant who tries
11267,BOOK II.,To soothe his consort as she lies
11268,BOOK II.,"Struck by the hunter's venomed dart,"
11269,BOOK II.,"So the great king disturbed in heart,"
11270,BOOK II.,Strove with soft hand and fond caress
11271,BOOK II.,"To soothe his darling queen's distress,"
11272,BOOK II.,And in his love addressed with sighs
11273,BOOK II.,The lady of the lotus eyes:
11274,BOOK II.,"""I know not, Queen, why thou shouldst be"
11275,BOOK II.,Thus angered to the heart with me.
11276,BOOK II.,"Say, who has slighted thee, or whence"
11277,BOOK II.,Has come the cause of such offence
11278,BOOK II.,"That in the dust thou liest low,"
11279,BOOK II.,"And rendest my fond heart with woe,"
11280,BOOK II.,As if some goblin of the night
11281,BOOK II.,"Had struck thee with a deadly blight,"
11282,BOOK II.,And cast foul influence on her
11283,BOOK II.,Whose spells my loving bosom stir?
11284,BOOK II.,"I have Physicians famed for skill,"
11285,BOOK II.,Each trained to cure some special ill:
11286,BOOK II.,"My sweetest lady, tell thy pain,"
11287,BOOK II.,And they shall make thee well again.
11288,BOOK II.,"Whom, darling, wouldst thou punished see?"
11289,BOOK II.,Or whom enriched with lordly fee?
11290,BOOK II.,"Weep not, my lovely Queen, and stay"
11291,BOOK II.,This grief that wears thy frame away;
11292,BOOK II.,"Speak, and the guilty shall be freed."
11293,BOOK II.,"The guiltless be condemned to bleed,"
11294,BOOK II.,"The poor enriched, the rich abased,"
11295,BOOK II.,"The low set high, the proud disgraced."
11296,BOOK II.,"My lords and I thy will obey,"
11297,BOOK II.,All slaves who own thy sovereign sway;
11298,BOOK II.,And I can ne'er my heart incline
11299,BOOK II.,To check in aught one wish of thine.
11300,BOOK II.,Now by my life I pray thee tell
11301,BOOK II.,The thoughts that in thy bosom dwell.
11302,BOOK II.,"The power and might thou knowest well,"
11303,BOOK II.,Should from thy breast all doubt expel.
11304,BOOK II.,"I swear by all my merit won,"
11305,BOOK II.,"Speak, and thy pleasure shall be done."
11306,BOOK II.,Far as the world's wide bounds extend
11307,BOOK II.,My glorious empire knows no end.
11308,BOOK II.,"Mine are the tribes in eastern lands,"
11309,BOOK II.,And those who dwell on Sindhu's sands:
11310,BOOK II.,"Mine is Suráshtra, far away,"
11311,BOOK II.,Suvíra's realm admits my sway.
11312,BOOK II.,"My best the southern nations fear,"
11313,BOOK II.,The Angas and the Vangas hear.
11314,BOOK II.,And as lord paramount I reign
11315,BOOK II.,"O'er Magadh and the Matsyas' plain,"
11316,BOOK II.,"Kosal, and Kási's wide domain:(273)"
11317,BOOK II.,"All rich in treasures of the mine,"
11318,BOOK II.,"In golden corn, sheep, goats, and kine."
11319,BOOK II.,"Choose what thou wilt. Kaikeyí, thence:"
11320,BOOK II.,"But tell me, O my darling, whence"
11321,BOOK II.,"Arose thy grief, and it shall fly"
11322,BOOK II.,"Like hoar-frost when the sun is high."""
11323,BOOK II.,
11324,BOOK II.,"She, by his loving words consoled,"
11325,BOOK II.,"Longed her dire purpose to unfold,"
11326,BOOK II.,And sought with sharper pangs to wring
11327,BOOK II.,The bosom of her lord the king.

11335,BOOK II.,"To him enthralled by love, and blind,"
11336,BOOK II.,"Pierced by his darts who shakes the mind,(274)"
11337,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí with remorseless breast
11338,BOOK II.,Her grand purpose thus expressed:
11339,BOOK II.,"""O King, no insult or neglect"
11340,BOOK II.,"Have I endured, or disrespect."
11341,BOOK II.,"One wish I have, and faith would see"
11342,BOOK II.,"That longing granted, lord, by thee."
11343,BOOK II.,Now pledge thy word if thou incline
11344,BOOK II.,"To listen to this prayer of mine,"
11345,BOOK II.,"Then I with confidence will speak,"
11346,BOOK II.,"And thou shalt hear the boon I seek."""
11347,BOOK II.,
11348,BOOK II.,"Ere she had ceased, the monarch fell,"
11349,BOOK II.,"A victim to the lady's spell,"
11350,BOOK II.,And to the deadly snare she set
11351,BOOK II.,"Sprang, like a roebuck to the net."
11352,BOOK II.,"Her lover raised her drooping head,"
11353,BOOK II.,"Smiled, playing with her hair, and said:"
11354,BOOK II.,"""Hast thou not learnt, wild dame, till now"
11355,BOOK II.,That there is none so dear as thou
11356,BOOK II.,"To me thy loving husband, save"
11357,BOOK II.,My Ráma bravest of the brave?
11358,BOOK II.,"By him my race's high-souled heir,"
11359,BOOK II.,"By him whom none can match, I swear,"
11360,BOOK II.,Now speak the wish that on thee weighs:
11361,BOOK II.,"By him whose right is length of days,"
11362,BOOK II.,Whom if my fond paternal eye
11363,BOOK II.,"Saw not one hour I needs must die,--"
11364,BOOK II.,"I swear by Ráma my dear son,"
11365,BOOK II.,"Speak, and thy bidding shall be done."
11366,BOOK II.,"Speak, darling; if thou choose, request"
11367,BOOK II.,To have the heart from out my breast;
11368,BOOK II.,"Regard my words, sweet love, and name"
11369,BOOK II.,The wish thy mind thinks fit to frame.
11370,BOOK II.,Nor let thy soul give way to doubt:
11371,BOOK II.,My power should drive suspicion out.
11372,BOOK II.,"Yea, by my merits won I swear,"
11373,BOOK II.,"Speak, darling, I will grant thy prayer."""
11374,BOOK II.,
11375,BOOK II.,"The queen, ambitious, overjoyed"
11376,BOOK II.,"To see him by her plot decoyed,"
11377,BOOK II.,"More eager still her aims to reach,"
11378,BOOK II.,Spoke her abominable speech:
11379,BOOK II.,"""A boon thou grantest, nothing loth,"
11380,BOOK II.,And swearest with repeated oath.
11381,BOOK II.,Now let the thirty Gods and three
11382,BOOK II.,"My witnesses, with Indra, be."

11384,BOOK II.,"Heaven, quarters, day and night, give ear."

11396,BOOK II.,"""Remember, King, that long-past day"
11397,BOOK II.,Of Gods' and demons' battle fray.
11398,BOOK II.,And how thy foe in doubtful strife
11399,BOOK II.,Had nigh bereft thee of thy life.
11400,BOOK II.,"Remember, it was only I"

11410,BOOK II.,These rites in Ráma's name begun--

11412,BOOK II.,The time is come to claim at last
11413,BOOK II.,"The double boon of days long-past,"
11414,BOOK II.,"When Gods and demons met in fight,"
11415,BOOK II.,And thou wouldst fain my care requite.
11416,BOOK II.,Now forth to Dandak's forest drive
11417,BOOK II.,"Thy Ráma for nine years and five,"
11418,BOOK II.,And let him dwell a hermit there
11419,BOOK II.,With deerskin coat and matted hair.
11420,BOOK II.,Without a rival let my boy

11432,BOOK II.,"With cruel words her dire request,"
11433,BOOK II.,Stood for a time absorbed in thought
11434,BOOK II.,While anguish in his bosom wrought.
11435,BOOK II.,"""Does some wild dream my heart assail?"
11436,BOOK II.,Or do my troubled senses fail?
11437,BOOK II.,Does some dire portent scare my view?
11438,BOOK II.,"Or frenzy's stroke my soul subdue?"""
11439,BOOK II.,"Thus as he thought, his troubled mind"
11440,BOOK II.,"In doubt and dread no rest could find,"
11441,BOOK II.,Distressed and trembling like a deer
11442,BOOK II.,Who sees the dreaded tigress near.
11443,BOOK II.,"On the bare ground his limbs he threw,"
11444,BOOK II.,"And many a long deep sigh he drew,"
11445,BOOK II.,"Like a wild snake, with fury blind,"
11446,BOOK II.,By charms within a ring confined.
11447,BOOK II.,"Once as the monarch's fury woke,"
11448,BOOK II.,"""Shame on thee!"" from his bosom broke,"
11449,BOOK II.,And then in sense-bewildering pain
11450,BOOK II.,He fainted on the ground again.
11451,BOOK II.,"At length, when slowly strength returned,"
11452,BOOK II.,He answered as his eyeballs burned
11453,BOOK II.,With the wild fury of his ire
11454,BOOK II.,"Consuming her, as 'twere, with fire:"
11455,BOOK II.,"""Fell traitress, thou whose thoughts design"

11458,BOOK II.,"Speak murderess, speak thou wicked one,"
11459,BOOK II.,Seeks he not evermore to please
11460,BOOK II.,Thee with all sonlike courtesies?
11461,BOOK II.,By what persuasion art thou led
11462,BOOK II.,To bring this ruin on his head?
11463,BOOK II.,"Ah me, that fondly unaware"
11464,BOOK II.,"I brought thee home my life to share,"
11465,BOOK II.,"Called daughter of a king, in truth"
11466,BOOK II.,A serpent with a venomed tooth!
11467,BOOK II.,What fault can I pretend to find
11468,BOOK II.,"In Ráma praised by all mankind,"
11469,BOOK II.,That I my darling should forsake?
11470,BOOK II.,"No, take my life, my glory take:"
11471,BOOK II.,"Let either queen be from me torn,"
11472,BOOK II.,But not my well-loved eldest-born.
11473,BOOK II.,"Him but to see is highest bliss,"
11474,BOOK II.,And death itself his face to miss.
11475,BOOK II.,"The world may sunless stand, the grain"
11476,BOOK II.,"May thrive without the genial rain,"
11477,BOOK II.,But if my Ráma be not nigh
11478,BOOK II.,My spirit from its frame will fly.
11479,BOOK II.,"Enough, thine impious plan forgo,"
11480,BOOK II.,O thou who plottest sin and woe.
11481,BOOK II.,"My head before thy feet, I kneel,"
11482,BOOK II.,And pray thee some compassion feel.
11483,BOOK II.,"O wicked dame, what can have led"
11484,BOOK II.,Thy heart to dare a plot so dread?
11485,BOOK II.,Perchance thy purpose is to sound
11486,BOOK II.,The grace thy son with me has found;
11487,BOOK II.,"Perchance the words that, all these days,"
11488,BOOK II.,"Thou still hast said in Ráma's praise,"
11489,BOOK II.,"Were only feigned, designed to cheer"
11490,BOOK II.,With flatteries a father's ear.
11491,BOOK II.,"Soon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,"
11492,BOOK II.,My bosom felt the anguish too.
11493,BOOK II.,"In empty halls art thou possessed,"
11494,BOOK II.,And subject to anothers' hest?
11495,BOOK II.,Now on Ikshváku's ancient race
11496,BOOK II.,"Falls foul disorder and disgrace,"
11497,BOOK II.,"If thou, O Queen, whose heart so long"

11503,BOOK II.,With thee my Ráma used to hold
11504,BOOK II.,Like place with Bharat lofty-souled.
11505,BOOK II.,"As thou so often, when the pair"
11506,BOOK II.,"Were children yet, wouldst fain declare."
11507,BOOK II.,And can thy righteous soul endure
11508,BOOK II.,"That Ráma glorious, pious, pure,"
11509,BOOK II.,Should to the distant wilds be sent
11510,BOOK II.,For fourteen years of banishment?
11511,BOOK II.,"Yea, Ráma Bharat's self exceeds"
11512,BOOK II.,"In love to thee and sonlike deeds,"
11513,BOOK II.,"And, for deserving love of thee,"
11514,BOOK II.,"As Bharat, even so is he."
11515,BOOK II.,Who better than that chieftain may
11516,BOOK II.,"Obedience, love, and honour pay,"
11517,BOOK II.,"Thy dignity with care protect,"
11518,BOOK II.,Thy slightest word and wish respect?
11519,BOOK II.,Of all his countless followers none
11520,BOOK II.,Can breathe a word against my son;
11521,BOOK II.,Of many thousands not a dame
11522,BOOK II.,Can hint reproach or whisper blame.
11523,BOOK II.,All creatures feel the sweet control
11524,BOOK II.,Of Ráma's pure and gentle soul.
11525,BOOK II.,The pride of Manu's race he binds
11526,BOOK II.,To him the people's grateful minds.
11527,BOOK II.,"He wins the subjects with his truth,"
11528,BOOK II.,"The poor with gifts and gentle ruth,"

11531,BOOK II.,"Truth, purity, religious zeal,"
11532,BOOK II.,"The hand to give, the heart to feel,"
11533,BOOK II.,"The love that ne'er betrays a friend,"
11534,BOOK II.,"The rectitude that naught can bend,"
11535,BOOK II.,"Knowledge, and meek obedience grace"

11538,BOOK II.,"'Gainst him in whom these virtues shine,"
11539,BOOK II.,"Whose glory with the sages vies,"
11540,BOOK II.,Peer of the Gods who rule the skies!
11541,BOOK II.,From him no harsh or bitter word
11542,BOOK II.,"To pain one creature have I heard,"
11543,BOOK II.,"And how can I my son address,"
11544,BOOK II.,"For thee, with words of bitterness?"
11545,BOOK II.,"Have mercy, Queen: some pity show"

11557,BOOK II.,"He grovelled on the ground, and lay"

11559,BOOK II.,"And ever and anon, assailed"
11560,BOOK II.,"By floods of woe he wept and wailed,"
11561,BOOK II.,Striving with eager speed to gain
11562,BOOK II.,The margent of his sea of pain.
11563,BOOK II.,
11564,BOOK II.,With fiercer words she fiercer yet
11565,BOOK II.,The hapless father's pleading met:
11566,BOOK II.,"""O Monarch, if thy soul repent"

11574,BOOK II.,"""She to whose love my life I owe,"
11575,BOOK II.,"Who saved me smitten by the foe,"
11576,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí, for her tender care,"
11577,BOOK II.,"Was cheated of the oath I sware."""
11578,BOOK II.,"Thus wilt thou answer, and forsworn"
11579,BOOK II.,Wilt draw on thee the princes' scorn.

11581,BOOK II.,How strong for truth was Saivya's love.
11582,BOOK II.,Pledged by his word the monarch gave
11583,BOOK II.,His flesh the suppliant bird to save.
11584,BOOK II.,"So King Alarka gave his eyes,"
11585,BOOK II.,And gained a mansion in the skies.
11586,BOOK II.,"The Sea himself his promise keeps,"
11587,BOOK II.,And ne'er beyond his limit sweeps.
11588,BOOK II.,"My deeds of old again recall,"
11589,BOOK II.,Nor let thy bond dishonoured fall.
11590,BOOK II.,"The rights of truth thou wouldst forget,"
11591,BOOK II.,"Thy Ráma on the throne to set,"
11592,BOOK II.,"And let thy days in pleasure glide,"
11593,BOOK II.,"Fond King, Kausalyá by thy side."
11594,BOOK II.,"Now call it by what name thou wilt,"
11595,BOOK II.,"Justice, injustice, virtue, guilt,"
11596,BOOK II.,"Thy word and oath remain the same,"
11597,BOOK II.,And thou must yield what thus I claim.
11598,BOOK II.,"If Ráma be anointed, I"
11599,BOOK II.,"This very day will surely die,"
11600,BOOK II.,"Before thy face will poison drink,"
11601,BOOK II.,And lifeless at thy feet will sink.
11602,BOOK II.,"Yea, better far to die than stay"
11603,BOOK II.,Alive to see one single day
11604,BOOK II.,The crowds before Kausalyá stand
11605,BOOK II.,And hail her queen with reverent hand.
11606,BOOK II.,"Now by my son, myself, I swear,"
11607,BOOK II.,"No gift, no promise whatsoe'er"
11608,BOOK II.,"My steadfast soul shall now content,"
11609,BOOK II.,"But only Ráma's banishment."""
11610,BOOK II.,
11611,BOOK II.,"So far she spake by rage impelled,"
11612,BOOK II.,And then the queen deep silence held.
11613,BOOK II.,"He heard her speech full fraught with ill,"
11614,BOOK II.,"But spoke no word bewildered still,"
11615,BOOK II.,Gazed on his love once held so dear
11616,BOOK II.,Who spoke unlovely rede to hear;
11617,BOOK II.,Then as he slowly pondered o'er
11618,BOOK II.,The queen's resolve and oath she swore.
11619,BOOK II.,"Once sighing forth, Ah Ráma! he"
11620,BOOK II.,Fell prone as falls a smitten tree.
11621,BOOK II.,"His senses lost like one insane,"
11622,BOOK II.,"Faint as a sick man weak with pain,"
11623,BOOK II.,"Or like a wounded snake dismayed,"
11624,BOOK II.,So lay the king whom earth obeyed.
11625,BOOK II.,"Long burning sighs he slowly heaved,"
11626,BOOK II.,"As, conquered by his woe, he grieved,"
11627,BOOK II.,And thus with tears and sobs between
11628,BOOK II.,His sad faint words addressed the queen:
11629,BOOK II.,
11630,BOOK II.,"""By whom, Kaikeyí, wast thou taught"
11631,BOOK II.,This flattering hope with ruin fraught?
11632,BOOK II.,"Have goblins seized thy soul, O dame,"
11633,BOOK II.,Who thus canst speak and feel no shame?
11634,BOOK II.,"Thy mind with sin is sicklied o'er,"
11635,BOOK II.,From thy first youth ne'er seen before.
11636,BOOK II.,"A good and loving wife wast thou,"
11637,BOOK II.,"But all, alas! is altered now."
11638,BOOK II.,What terror can have seized thy breast
11639,BOOK II.,"To make thee frame this dire request,"
11640,BOOK II.,"That Bharat o'er the land may reign,"
11641,BOOK II.,And Ráma in the woods remain?
11642,BOOK II.,"Turn from thine evil ways, O turn,"
11643,BOOK II.,"And thy perfidious counsel spurn,"
11644,BOOK II.,If thou would fain a favour do
11645,BOOK II.,"To people, lord, and Bharat too."
11646,BOOK II.,"O wicked traitress, fierce and vile,"
11647,BOOK II.,"Who lovest deeds of sin and guile,"
11648,BOOK II.,"What crime or grievance dost thou see,"
11649,BOOK II.,What fault in Ráma or in me?
11650,BOOK II.,Thy son will ne'er the throne accept
11651,BOOK II.,"If Ráma from his rights be kept,"
11652,BOOK II.,For Bharat's heart more firmly yet
11653,BOOK II.,Than Ráma's is on justice set.
11654,BOOK II.,"How shall I say, Go forth, and brook"
11655,BOOK II.,"Upon my Ráma's face to look,"
11656,BOOK II.,See his pale cheek and ashy lips
11657,BOOK II.,Dimmed like the moon in sad eclipse?
11658,BOOK II.,How see the plan so well prepared
11659,BOOK II.,"When prudent friends my counsels shared,"
11660,BOOK II.,"All ruined, like a host laid low"
11661,BOOK II.,Beneath some foeman's murderous blow.
11662,BOOK II.,"What will these gathered princes say,"
11663,BOOK II.,From regions near and far away?
11664,BOOK II.,"""O'erlong endures the monarch's reign,"
11665,BOOK II.,"or now he is a child again."""
11666,BOOK II.,When many a good and holy sage
11667,BOOK II.,"In Scripture versed, revered for age,"
11668,BOOK II.,"Shall ask for Ráma, what shall I"
11669,BOOK II.,"Unhappy, what shall I reply?"
11670,BOOK II.,"""By Queen Kaikeyí long distressed"
11671,BOOK II.,"I drove him forth and dispossessed."""
11672,BOOK II.,"Although herein the truth I speak,"
11673,BOOK II.,They all will hold me false and weak.
11674,BOOK II.,What will Kausalyá say when she
11675,BOOK II.,Demands her son exiled by me?
11676,BOOK II.,"Alas! what answer shall I frame,"
11677,BOOK II.,Or how console the injured dame?
11678,BOOK II.,"She like a slave on me attends,"
11679,BOOK II.,And with a sister's care she blends
11680,BOOK II.,"A mother's love, a wife's, a friend's."
11681,BOOK II.,"In spite of all her tender care,"
11682,BOOK II.,"Her noble son, her face most fair,"
11683,BOOK II.,Another queen I could prefer
11684,BOOK II.,"And for thy sake neglected her,"
11685,BOOK II.,"But now, O Queen, my heart is grieved"
11686,BOOK II.,"For love and care by thee received,"
11687,BOOK II.,E'en as the sickening wretch repents
11688,BOOK II.,His dainty meal and condiments.
11689,BOOK II.,And how will Queen Sumitrá trust
11690,BOOK II.,"The husband whom she finds unjust,"
11691,BOOK II.,Seeing my Ráma driven hence
11692,BOOK II.,"Dishonoured, and for no offence?"
11693,BOOK II.,Ah! the Videhan bride will hear
11694,BOOK II.,"A double woe, a double fear,"
11695,BOOK II.,"Two whelming sorrows at one breath,"
11696,BOOK II.,"Her lord's disgrace, his father's death."
11697,BOOK II.,Mine aged bosom she will wring
11698,BOOK II.,"And kill me with her sorrowing,"
11699,BOOK II.,Sad as a fair nymph left to weep
11700,BOOK II.,Deserted on Himálaya's steep.
11701,BOOK II.,"For short will be my days, I ween,"
11702,BOOK II.,When I with mournful eyes have seen
11703,BOOK II.,My Ráma wandering forth alone
11704,BOOK II.,And heard dear Sítá sob and moan.
11705,BOOK II.,Ah me! my fond belief I rue.
11706,BOOK II.,"Vile traitress, loved as good and true,"
11707,BOOK II.,"As one who in his thirst has quaffed,"
11708,BOOK II.,"Deceived by looks, a deadly draught."
11709,BOOK II.,"Ah! thou hast slain me, murderess, while"
11710,BOOK II.,"Soothing my soul with words of guile,"
11711,BOOK II.,As the wild hunter kills the deer
11712,BOOK II.,Lured from the brake his song to hear.

11717,BOOK II.,And such dishonour will be mine
11718,BOOK II.,As whelms a Bráhman drunk with wine.
11719,BOOK II.,"Ah me, for my unhappy fate,"
11720,BOOK II.,Compelled thy words to tolerate!
11721,BOOK II.,Such woe is sent to scourge a crime
11722,BOOK II.,Committed in some distant time.
11723,BOOK II.,For many a day with sinful care
11724,BOOK II.,"I cherished thee, thou sin and snare,"
11725,BOOK II.,"Kept thee, unwitting, like a cord"
11726,BOOK II.,Destined to bind its hapless lord.
11727,BOOK II.,"Mine hours of ease I spent with thee,"
11728,BOOK II.,"Nor deemed my love my death would be,"
11729,BOOK II.,"While like a heedless child I played,"
11730,BOOK II.,On a black snake my hand I laid.
11731,BOOK II.,A cry from every mouth will burst
11732,BOOK II.,"And all the world will hold me curst,"
11733,BOOK II.,Because I saw my high-souled son
11734,BOOK II.,"Unkinged, unfathered, and undone;"

11744,BOOK II.,"When I pronounce the stern decree,"
11745,BOOK II.,"""Hence, Ráma, to the woods away,"""
11746,BOOK II.,"All he will say is, I obey."
11747,BOOK II.,"O, if he would my will withstand"
11748,BOOK II.,"When banished from his home and land,"
11749,BOOK II.,This were a comfort in my woe;
11750,BOOK II.,"But he will ne'er do this, I know."
11751,BOOK II.,"My Ráma to the forest fled,"
11752,BOOK II.,"And curses thick upon my head,"
11753,BOOK II.,"Grim Death will bear me hence away,"
11754,BOOK II.,His world-abominated prey.
11755,BOOK II.,When I am gone and Ráma too.
11756,BOOK II.,How wilt thou those I love pursue?
11757,BOOK II.,What vengeful sin will be designed
11758,BOOK II.,Against the queens I leave behind?
11759,BOOK II.,When thou hast slain her son and me
11760,BOOK II.,Kausalyá soon will follow: she
11761,BOOK II.,"Will sink beneath her sorrows' weight,"
11762,BOOK II.,And die like me disconsolate.

11764,BOOK II.,"And let thy heart be gratified,"
11765,BOOK II.,"When thou my queens and me hast hurled,"
11766,BOOK II.,"And children, to the under world."
11767,BOOK II.,Soon wilt thou rule as empress o'er
11768,BOOK II.,My noble house unvext before.
11769,BOOK II.,"But then to wild confusion left,"
11770,BOOK II.,Of Ráma and of me bereft.
11771,BOOK II.,If Bharat to thy plan consent
11772,BOOK II.,"And long for Ráma's banishment,"
11773,BOOK II.,Ne'er let his hands presume to pay
11774,BOOK II.,The funeral honours to my clay.

11781,BOOK II.,In whom the night of ruin lies
11782,BOOK II.,Veiled in a consort's fair disguise.
11783,BOOK II.,The scorn of all and deepest shame
11784,BOOK II.,"Will long pursue my hated name,"
11785,BOOK II.,"And dire disgrace on me will press,"

11795,BOOK II.,How shall he now his life sustain
11796,BOOK II.,With acid fruit and woodland grain?
11797,BOOK II.,"He spends his time unvext by cares,"
11798,BOOK II.,And robes of precious texture wears:

11817,BOOK II.,"I joy his very step to hear,"
11818,BOOK II.,As though his godlike form I viewed;
11819,BOOK II.,And when I see my Ráma near
11820,BOOK II.,I feel my youth again renewed.
11821,BOOK II.,"There might be life without the sun,"
11822,BOOK II.,"Yea, e'en if Indra sent no rain,"
11823,BOOK II.,"But, were my Ráma banished, none"

11830,BOOK II.,And then with Bharat rule the state;
11831,BOOK II.,"So bring the kingdom to decay,"
11832,BOOK II.,"And fawn on those thy lord who hate,"
11833,BOOK II.,"Plotter of woe, for evil bred,"

11837,BOOK II.,"My Ráma's words are ever kind,"

11840,BOOK II.,A fault in him whom all admire?
11841,BOOK II.,"Yield to despair, go mad, or die,"
11842,BOOK II.,Or sink within the rifted earth;

11972,BOOK II.,"In truth alone is justice placed,"
11973,BOOK II.,On truth the words of God are based:
11974,BOOK II.,A life in truth unchanging past
11975,BOOK II.,Will bring the highest bliss at last.
11976,BOOK II.,"If thou the right would still pursue,"
11977,BOOK II.,Be constant to thy word and true:
11978,BOOK II.,"Let me thy promise fruitful see,"
11979,BOOK II.,"For boons, O King, proceed from thee."
11980,BOOK II.,"Now to preserve thy righteous fame,"
11981,BOOK II.,And yielding to my earnest claim--
11982,BOOK II.,"Thrice I repeat it--send thy child,"
11983,BOOK II.,"Thy Ráma, to the forest wild."
11984,BOOK II.,"But if the boon thou still deny,"
11985,BOOK II.,"Before thy face, forlorn, I die."""
11986,BOOK II.,
11987,BOOK II.,Thus was the helpless monarch stung
11988,BOOK II.,"By Queen Kaikeyí's fearless tongue,"
11989,BOOK II.,As Bali strove in vain to loose
11990,BOOK II.,His limbs from Indra's fatal noose.
11991,BOOK II.,"Dismayed in soul and pale with fear,"
11992,BOOK II.,"The monarch, like a trembling steer"
11993,BOOK II.,"Between the chariot's wheel and yoke,"
11994,BOOK II.,"Again to Queen Kaikeyí spoke,"
11995,BOOK II.,"With sad eyes fixt in vacant stare,"
11996,BOOK II.,Gathering courage from despair:
11997,BOOK II.,"""That hand I took, thou sinful dame,"
11998,BOOK II.,"With texts, before the sacred flame,"
11999,BOOK II.,"Thee and thy son, I scorn and hate,"
12000,BOOK II.,And all at once repudiate.
12001,BOOK II.,The night is fled: the dawn is near:
12002,BOOK II.,Soon will the holy priests be here
12003,BOOK II.,To bid me for the rite prepare
12004,BOOK II.,"That with my son the throne will share,"
12005,BOOK II.,The preparation made to grace
12006,BOOK II.,My Ráma in his royal place--
12007,BOOK II.,"With this, e'en this, my darling for"
12008,BOOK II.,My death the funeral flood shall pour.
12009,BOOK II.,Thou and thy son at least forbear
12010,BOOK II.,"In offerings to my shade to share,"
12011,BOOK II.,For by the plot thy guile has laid
12012,BOOK II.,His consecration will be stayed.
12013,BOOK II.,This very day how shall I brook
12014,BOOK II.,To meet each subject's altered look?
12015,BOOK II.,To mark each gloomy joyless brow
12016,BOOK II.,"That was so bright and glad but now?"""
12017,BOOK II.,
12018,BOOK II.,While thus the high-souled monarch spoke
12019,BOOK II.,"To the stern queen, the Morning broke,"
12020,BOOK II.,"And holy night had slowly fled,"
12021,BOOK II.,With moon and stars engarlanded.
12022,BOOK II.,Yet once again the cruel queen
12023,BOOK II.,"Spoke words in answer fierce and keen,"
12024,BOOK II.,"Still on her evil purpose bent,"
12025,BOOK II.,Wild with her rage and eloquent:
12026,BOOK II.,"""What speech is this? Such words as these"
12027,BOOK II.,Seem sprung from poison-sown disease.
12028,BOOK II.,Quick to thy noble Ráma send
12029,BOOK II.,And bid him on his sire attend.
12030,BOOK II.,When to my son the rule is given;
12031,BOOK II.,When Ráma to the woods is driven;
12032,BOOK II.,"When not a rival copes with me,"
12033,BOOK II.,"From chains of duty thou art free."""
12034,BOOK II.,
12035,BOOK II.,"Thus goaded, like a generous steed"
12036,BOOK II.,"Urged by sharp spurs to double speed,"
12037,BOOK II.,"""My senses are astray,"" he cried,"
12038,BOOK II.,"""And duty's bonds my hands have tied."
12039,BOOK II.,"I long to see mine eldest son,"
12040,BOOK II.,"My virtuous, my beloved one."""
12041,BOOK II.,
12042,BOOK II.,And now the night had past away;
12043,BOOK II.,"Out shone the Maker of the Day,"
12044,BOOK II.,Bringing the planetary hour
12045,BOOK II.,And moment of auspicious power.
12046,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha, virtuous, far renowned,"
12047,BOOK II.,"Whose young disciples girt him round,"
12048,BOOK II.,With sacred things without delay
12049,BOOK II.,Through the fair city took his way.
12050,BOOK II.,"He traversed, where the people thronged,"
12051,BOOK II.,"And all for Ráma's coming longed,"
12052,BOOK II.,The town as fair in festive show
12053,BOOK II.,As his who lays proud cities low.(278)
12054,BOOK II.,He reached the palace where he heard
12055,BOOK II.,"The mingled notes of many a bird,"
12056,BOOK II.,Where crowded thick high-honoured bands
12057,BOOK II.,Of guards with truncheons in their hands.
12058,BOOK II.,"Begirt by many a sage, elate,"
12059,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha reached the royal gate,"
12060,BOOK II.,And standing by the door he found
12061,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, for his form renowned,"
12062,BOOK II.,The king's illustrious charioteer
12063,BOOK II.,And noble counsellor and peer.
12064,BOOK II.,To him well skilled in every part
12065,BOOK II.,Of his hereditary art
12066,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha said: ""O charioteer,"
12067,BOOK II.,"Inform the king that I am here,"
12068,BOOK II.,Here ready by my side behold
12069,BOOK II.,"These sacred vessels made of gold,"
12070,BOOK II.,Which water for the rite contain
12071,BOOK II.,From Gangá and each distant main.
12072,BOOK II.,Here for installing I have brought
12073,BOOK II.,"The seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,"
12074,BOOK II.,All kinds of seed and precious scent
12075,BOOK II.,And many a gem and ornament;
12076,BOOK II.,"Grain, sacred grass, the garden's spoil,"
12077,BOOK II.,Honey and curds and milk and oil;
12078,BOOK II.,"Eight radiant maids, the best of all"
12079,BOOK II.,War elephants that feed in stall;
12080,BOOK II.,"A four-horse car, a bow and sword."
12081,BOOK II.,"A litter, men to bear their lord;"
12082,BOOK II.,A white umbrella bright and fair
12083,BOOK II.,That with the moon may well compare;
12084,BOOK II.,Two chouries of the whitest hair;
12085,BOOK II.,A golden beaker rich and rare;
12086,BOOK II.,"A bull high-humped and fair to view,"
12087,BOOK II.,Girt with gold bands and white of hue;
12088,BOOK II.,"A four-toothed steed with flowing mane,"
12089,BOOK II.,A throne which lions carved sustain;
12090,BOOK II.,"A tiger's skin, the sacred fire,"
12091,BOOK II.,"Fresh kindled, which the rites require;"
12092,BOOK II.,"The best musicians skilled to play,"
12093,BOOK II.,And dancing-girls in raiment gay;
12094,BOOK II.,"Kine, Bráhmans, teachers fill the court,"
12095,BOOK II.,And bird and beast of purest sort.
12096,BOOK II.,"From town and village, far and near,"
12097,BOOK II.,The noblest men are gathered here;
12098,BOOK II.,"Here merchants with their followers crowd,"
12099,BOOK II.,"And men in joyful converse loud,"
12100,BOOK II.,And kings from many a distant land
12101,BOOK II.,To view the consecration stand.
12102,BOOK II.,"The dawn is come, the lucky day;"
12103,BOOK II.,"Go bid the monarch haste away,"
12104,BOOK II.,That now Prince Ráma may obtain
12105,BOOK II.,"The empire, and begin his reign."""
12106,BOOK II.,
12107,BOOK II.,Soon as he heard the high behest
12108,BOOK II.,The driver of the chariot pressed
12109,BOOK II.,"Within the chambers of the king,"
12110,BOOK II.,His lord with praises honouring.
12111,BOOK II.,And none of all the warders checked
12112,BOOK II.,His entrance for their great respect
12113,BOOK II.,"Of him well known, in place so high,"
12114,BOOK II.,Still fain their king to gratify.
12115,BOOK II.,"He stood beside the royal chief,"
12116,BOOK II.,"Unwitting of his deadly grief,"
12117,BOOK II.,And with sweet words began to sing
12118,BOOK II.,The praises of his lord and king:
12119,BOOK II.,"""As, when the sun begins to rise,"
12120,BOOK II.,"The sparkling sea delights our eyes,"
12121,BOOK II.,"Wake, calm with gentle soul, and thus"
12122,BOOK II.,"Give rapture, mighty King, to us."
12123,BOOK II.,As Mátali(279) this selfsame hour
12124,BOOK II.,"Sang lauds of old to Indra's power,"
12125,BOOK II.,"When he the Titan hosts o'erthrew,"
12126,BOOK II.,So hymn I thee with praises due.
12127,BOOK II.,"The Vedas, with their kindred lore,"
12128,BOOK II.,"Brahmá their soul-born Lord adore,"
12129,BOOK II.,"With all the doctrines of the wise,"
12130,BOOK II.,"And bid him, as I bid thee, rise."
12131,BOOK II.,"As, with the moon, the Lord of Day"
12132,BOOK II.,Wakes with the splendour of his ray
12133,BOOK II.,"Prolific Earth, who neath him lies,"
12134,BOOK II.,"So, mighty King, I bid thee rise."
12135,BOOK II.,"With blissful words, O Lord of men,"
12136,BOOK II.,"Rise, radiant in thy form, as when"
12137,BOOK II.,The sun ascending darts his light
12138,BOOK II.,From Meru's everlasting height.
12139,BOOK II.,"May Siva, Agni, Sun, and Moon"
12140,BOOK II.,"Bestow on thee each choicest boon,"
12141,BOOK II.,"Kuvera, Varuna, Indra bless"
12142,BOOK II.,Kakutstha's son with all success.
12143,BOOK II.,"Awake, the holy night is fled,"
12144,BOOK II.,The happy light abroad is spread;
12145,BOOK II.,"Awake, O best of kings, and share"
12146,BOOK II.,The glorious task that claims thy care.
12147,BOOK II.,"The holy sage Vasishtha waits,"
12148,BOOK II.,"With all his Bráhmans, at the gate."
12149,BOOK II.,"Give thy decree, without delay,"
12150,BOOK II.,To consecrate thy son today.
12151,BOOK II.,"As armies, by no captain led,"
12152,BOOK II.,"As flocks that feed unshepherded,"
12153,BOOK II.,Such is the fortune of a state
12154,BOOK II.,"Without a king and desolate."""
12155,BOOK II.,
12156,BOOK II.,"Such were the words the bard addressed,"
12157,BOOK II.,With weight of sage advice impressed;
12158,BOOK II.,"And, as he heard, the hapless king"
12159,BOOK II.,Felt deeper yet his sorrow's sting.
12160,BOOK II.,"At length, all joy and comfort fled,"
12161,BOOK II.,"He raised his eyes with weeping red,"
12162,BOOK II.,"And, mournful for his Ráma's sake,"
12163,BOOK II.,The good and glorious monarch spake:
12164,BOOK II.,"""Why seek with idle praise to greet"
12165,BOOK II.,The wretch for whom no praise is meet?
12166,BOOK II.,"Thy words mine aching bosom tear,"
12167,BOOK II.,"And plunge me deeper in despair."""
12168,BOOK II.,
12169,BOOK II.,"Sumantra heard the sad reply,"
12170,BOOK II.,And saw his master's tearful eye.
12171,BOOK II.,With reverent palm to palm applied
12172,BOOK II.,He drew a little space aside.
12173,BOOK II.,"Then, as the king, with misery weak,"
12174,BOOK II.,"With vain endeavour strove to speak,"
12175,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí, skilled in plot and plan,"
12176,BOOK II.,To sage Sumantra thus began:
12177,BOOK II.,"""The king, absorbed in joyful thought"
12178,BOOK II.,"For his dear son, no rest has sought:"
12179,BOOK II.,"Sleepless to him the night has past,"
12180,BOOK II.,And now o'erwatched he sinks at last.
12181,BOOK II.,"Then go, Sumantra, and with speed"
12182,BOOK II.,The glorious Ráma hither lead:
12183,BOOK II.,"Go, as I pray, nor longer wait;"
12184,BOOK II.,"No time is this to hesitate."""
12185,BOOK II.,"""How can I go, O Lady fair,"
12186,BOOK II.,"Unless my lord his will declare?"""
12187,BOOK II.,"""Fain would I see him,"" cried the king,"
12188,BOOK II.,"""Quick, quick, my beauteous Ráma bring."""
12189,BOOK II.,Then rose the happy thought to cheer
12190,BOOK II.,"The bosom of the charioteer,"
12191,BOOK II.,"""The king, I ween, of pious mind,"
12192,BOOK II.,"The consecration has designed."""
12193,BOOK II.,"Sumantra for his wisdom famed,"
12194,BOOK II.,"Delighted with the thought he framed,"
12195,BOOK II.,"From the calm chamber, like a bay"
12196,BOOK II.,"Of crowded ocean, took his way."
12197,BOOK II.,"He turned his face to neither side,"
12198,BOOK II.,But forth he hurried straight;
12199,BOOK II.,Only a little while he eyed
12200,BOOK II.,The guards who kept the gate.
12201,BOOK II.,He saw in front a gathered crowd
12202,BOOK II.,"Of men of every class,"
12203,BOOK II.,"Who, parting as he came, allowed"
12204,BOOK II.,The charioteer to pass.
12205,BOOK II.,
12206,BOOK II.,
12207,BOOK II.,
12208,BOOK II.,
12209,BOOK II.,Canto XV. The Preparations.
12210,BOOK II.,
12211,BOOK II.,
12212,BOOK II.,"There slept the Bráhmans, deeply read"
12213,BOOK II.,"In Scripture, till the night had fled;"
12214,BOOK II.,"Then, with the royal chaplains, they"
12215,BOOK II.,Took each his place in long array.
12216,BOOK II.,"There gathered fast the chiefs of trade,"
12217,BOOK II.,"Nor peer nor captain long delayed,"
12218,BOOK II.,Assembling all in order due
12219,BOOK II.,The consecrating rite to view.
12220,BOOK II.,
12221,BOOK II.,The morning dawned with cloudless ray
12222,BOOK II.,"On Pushya's high auspicious day,"
12223,BOOK II.,And Cancer with benignant power
12224,BOOK II.,Looked down on Ráma's natal hour.
12225,BOOK II.,"The twice-born chiefs, with zealous heed,"
12226,BOOK II.,Made ready what the rite would need.
12227,BOOK II.,The well-wrought throne of holy wood
12228,BOOK II.,And golden urns in order stood.
12229,BOOK II.,There was the royal car whereon
12230,BOOK II.,A tiger's skin resplendent shone;
12231,BOOK II.,"There water, brought for sprinkling thence"
12232,BOOK II.,"Where, in their sacred confluence,"
12233,BOOK II.,"Blend Jumná's waves with Gangá's tide,"
12234,BOOK II.,"From many a holy flood beside,"
12235,BOOK II.,"From brook and fountain far and near,"
12236,BOOK II.,"From pool and river, sea and mere."
12237,BOOK II.,"And there were honey, curd, and oil,"
12238,BOOK II.,"Parched rice and grass, the garden's spoil,"
12239,BOOK II.,"Fresh milk, eight girls in bright attire,"
12240,BOOK II.,An elephant with eyes of fire;
12241,BOOK II.,"And urns of gold and silver made,"
12242,BOOK II.,"With milky branches overlaid,"
12243,BOOK II.,"All brimming from each sacred flood,"
12244,BOOK II.,And decked with many a lotus bud.
12245,BOOK II.,"And dancing-women fair and free,"
12246,BOOK II.,"Gay with their gems, were there to see,"
12247,BOOK II.,Who stood in bright apparel by
12248,BOOK II.,With lovely brow and witching eye.
12249,BOOK II.,"White flashed the jewelled chouri there,"
12250,BOOK II.,And shone like moonbeams through the air;
12251,BOOK II.,The white umbrella overhead
12252,BOOK II.,"A pale and moonlike lustre shed,"
12253,BOOK II.,"Wont in pure splendour to precede,"
12254,BOOK II.,And in such rites the pomp to lead.
12255,BOOK II.,There stood the charger by the side
12256,BOOK II.,Of the great bull of snow-white hide;
12257,BOOK II.,"There was all music soft and loud,"
12258,BOOK II.,And bards and minstrels swelled the crowd.
12259,BOOK II.,For now the monarch bade combine
12260,BOOK II.,Each custom of his ancient line
12261,BOOK II.,With every rite Ayodhyá's state
12262,BOOK II.,"Observed, her kings to consecrate."
12263,BOOK II.,
12264,BOOK II.,"Then, summoned by the king's behest,"
12265,BOOK II.,"The multitudes together pressed,"
12266,BOOK II.,"And, missing still the royal sire,"
12267,BOOK II.,"Began, impatient, to inquire:"
12268,BOOK II.,"""Who to our lord will tidings bear"
12269,BOOK II.,That all his people throng the square?
12270,BOOK II.,"Where is the king? the sun is bright,"
12271,BOOK II.,"And all is ready for the rite."""
12272,BOOK II.,
12273,BOOK II.,"As thus they spoke, Sumantra, tried"
12274,BOOK II.,"In counsel, to the chiefs replied,"
12275,BOOK II.,Gathered from lands on every side:
12276,BOOK II.,"""To Ráma's house I swiftly drave,"
12277,BOOK II.,For so the king his mandate gave.
12278,BOOK II.,Our aged lord and Ráma too
12279,BOOK II.,In honour high hold all of you:
12280,BOOK II.,I in your words (be long your days!)
12281,BOOK II.,"Will ask him why he thus delays."""
12282,BOOK II.,
12283,BOOK II.,"Thus spoke the peer in Scripture read,"
12284,BOOK II.,And to the ladies' bower he sped.
12285,BOOK II.,"Quick through the gates Sumantra hied,"
12286,BOOK II.,Which access ne'er to him denied.
12287,BOOK II.,"Behind the curtained screen he drew,"
12288,BOOK II.,Which veiled the chamber from the view.
12289,BOOK II.,In benediction loud he raised
12290,BOOK II.,"His voice, and thus the monarch praised:"
12291,BOOK II.,"""Sun, Moon, Kuvera, Siva bless"
12292,BOOK II.,Kakutstha's son with high success!
12293,BOOK II.,"The Lords of air, flood, fire decree"
12294,BOOK II.,"The victory, my King, to thee!"
12295,BOOK II.,"The holy night has past away,"
12296,BOOK II.,Auspicious shines the morning's ray.
12297,BOOK II.,"Rise, Lord of men, thy part to take"
12298,BOOK II.,In the great rite. Awake! awake!
12299,BOOK II.,"Bráhmans and captains, chiefs of trade,"
12300,BOOK II.,All wait in festive garb arrayed;
12301,BOOK II.,For thee they look with eager eyes:
12302,BOOK II.,"O Raghu's son, awake! arise."""
12303,BOOK II.,
12304,BOOK II.,"To him in holy Scripture read,"
12305,BOOK II.,"Who hailed him thus, the monarch said,"
12306,BOOK II.,Upraising from his sleep his head:
12307,BOOK II.,"""Go, Ráma, hither lead as thou"
12308,BOOK II.,Wast ordered by the queen but now.
12309,BOOK II.,"Come, tell me why my mandate laid"
12310,BOOK II.,Upon thee thus is disobeyed.
12311,BOOK II.,Away! and Ráma hither bring;
12312,BOOK II.,"I sleep not: make no tarrying."""
12313,BOOK II.,
12314,BOOK II.,Thus gave the king command anew:
12315,BOOK II.,Sumantra from his lord withdrew;
12316,BOOK II.,"With head in lowly reverence bent,"
12317,BOOK II.,"And filled with thoughts of joy, he went."
12318,BOOK II.,"The royal street he traversed, where"
12319,BOOK II.,"Waved flag and pennon to the air,"
12320,BOOK II.,"And, as with joy the car he drove,"
12321,BOOK II.,He let his eyes delighted rove.
12322,BOOK II.,"On every side, where'er he came,"
12323,BOOK II.,"He heard glad words, their theme the same,"
12324,BOOK II.,As in their joy the gathered folk
12325,BOOK II.,Of Ráma and the throning spoke.
12326,BOOK II.,Then saw he Ráma's palace bright
12327,BOOK II.,"And vast as Mount Kailása's height,"
12328,BOOK II.,That glorious in its beauty showed
12329,BOOK II.,As Indra's own supreme abode:
12330,BOOK II.,With folding doors both high and wide;
12331,BOOK II.,With hundred porches beautified:
12332,BOOK II.,Where golden statues towering rose
12333,BOOK II.,O'er gemmed and coralled porticoes.
12334,BOOK II.,"Bright like a cave in Meru's side,"
12335,BOOK II.,Or clouds through Autumn's sky that ride:
12336,BOOK II.,"Festooned with length of bloomy twine,"
12337,BOOK II.,"Flashing with pearls and jewels' shine,"
12338,BOOK II.,While sandal-wood and aloe lent
12339,BOOK II.,The mingled riches of their scent;
12340,BOOK II.,With all the odorous sweets that fill
12341,BOOK II.,The breezy heights of Dardar's hill.
12342,BOOK II.,"There by the gate the Sáras screamed,"
12343,BOOK II.,And shrill-toned peacocks' plumage gleamed.
12344,BOOK II.,"Its floors with deftest art inlaid,"
12345,BOOK II.,"Its sculptured wolves in gold arrayed,"
12346,BOOK II.,With its bright sheen the palace took
12347,BOOK II.,"The mind of man and chained the look,"
12348,BOOK II.,"For like the sun and moon it glowed,"
12349,BOOK II.,And mocked Kuvera's loved abode.
12350,BOOK II.,Circling the walls a crowd he viewed
12351,BOOK II.,"Who stood in reverent attitude,"
12352,BOOK II.,With throngs of countrymen who sought
12353,BOOK II.,Acceptance of the gifts they brought.
12354,BOOK II.,"The elephant was stationed there,"
12355,BOOK II.,Appointed Ráma's self to bear;
12356,BOOK II.,"Adorned with pearls, his brow and cheek"
12357,BOOK II.,"Were sandal-dyed in many a streak,"
12358,BOOK II.,"While he, in stature, bulk, and pride,"
12359,BOOK II.,With Indra's own Airávat(280) vied.
12360,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, borne by coursers fleet,"
12361,BOOK II.,"Flashing a radiance o'er the street,"
12362,BOOK II.,"To Ráma's palace flew,"
12363,BOOK II.,"And all who lined the royal road,"
12364,BOOK II.,"Or thronged the prince's rich abode,"
12365,BOOK II.,Rejoiced as near he drew.
12366,BOOK II.,And with delight his bosom swelled
12367,BOOK II.,As onward still his course he held
12368,BOOK II.,Through many a sumptuous court
12369,BOOK II.,"Like Indra's palace nobly made,"
12370,BOOK II.,"Where peacocks revelled in the shade,"
12371,BOOK II.,And beasts of silvan sort.
12372,BOOK II.,"Through many a hall and chamber wide,"
12373,BOOK II.,That with Kailása's splendour vied.
12374,BOOK II.,"Or mansions of the Blest,"
12375,BOOK II.,"While Ráma's friends, beloved and tried,"
12376,BOOK II.,"Before his coming stepped aside,"
12377,BOOK II.,Still on Sumantra pressed.
12378,BOOK II.,"He reached the chamber door, where stood"
12379,BOOK II.,"Around his followers young and good,"
12380,BOOK II.,"Bard, minstrel, charioteer,"
12381,BOOK II.,"Well skilled the tuneful chords to sweep,"
12382,BOOK II.,"With soothing strain to lull to sleep,"
12383,BOOK II.,Or laud their master dear.
12384,BOOK II.,"Then, like a dolphin darting through"
12385,BOOK II.,Unfathomed depths of ocean's blue
12386,BOOK II.,"With store of jewels decked,"
12387,BOOK II.,"Through crowded halls that rock-like rose,"
12388,BOOK II.,"Or as proud hills where clouds repose,"
12389,BOOK II.,Sumantra sped unchecked--
12390,BOOK II.,Halls like the glittering domes on high
12391,BOOK II.,Reared for the dwellers of the sky
12392,BOOK II.,By heavenly architect.
12393,BOOK II.,

12397,BOOK II.,Canto XVI. Ráma Summoned.
12398,BOOK II.,
12399,BOOK II.,
12400,BOOK II.,So through the crowded inner door
12401,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, skilled in ancient lore,"
12402,BOOK II.,On to the private chambers pressed
12403,BOOK II.,Which stood apart from all the rest.
12404,BOOK II.,"There youthful warriors, true and bold,"
12405,BOOK II.,"Whose ears were ringed with polished gold,"
12406,BOOK II.,"All armed with trusty bows and darts,"
12407,BOOK II.,Watched with devoted eyes and hearts.
12408,BOOK II.,"And hoary men, a faithful train,"
12409,BOOK II.,"Whose aged hands held staves of cane,"
12410,BOOK II.,"The ladies' guard, apparelled fair"
12411,BOOK II.,"In red attire, were stationed there."
12412,BOOK II.,"Soon as they saw Sumantra nigh,"
12413,BOOK II.,"Each longed his lord to gratify,"
12414,BOOK II.,And from his seat beside the door
12415,BOOK II.,Up sprang each ancient servitor.
12416,BOOK II.,Then to the warders quickly cried
12417,BOOK II.,"The skilled Sumantra, void of pride:"
12418,BOOK II.,"""Tell Ráma that the charioteer"
12419,BOOK II.,"Sumantra waits for audience here."""
12420,BOOK II.,The ancient men with one accord
12421,BOOK II.,"Seeking the pleasure of their lord,"
12422,BOOK II.,Passing with speed the chamber door
12423,BOOK II.,To Ráma's ear the message bore.
12424,BOOK II.,Forthwith the prince with duteous heed
12425,BOOK II.,"Called in the messenger with speed,"
12426,BOOK II.,"For 'twas his sire's command, he knew,"
12427,BOOK II.,That sent him for the interview.
12428,BOOK II.,"Like Lord Kuvera, well arrayed,"
12429,BOOK II.,"He pressed a couch of gold,"
12430,BOOK II.,Wherefrom a covering of brocade
12431,BOOK II.,Hung down in many a fold.
12432,BOOK II.,Oil and the sandal's fragrant dust
12433,BOOK II.,Had tinged his body o'er
12434,BOOK II.,Dark as the stream the spearman's thrust
12435,BOOK II.,Drains from the wounded boar.
12436,BOOK II.,"Him Sítá watched with tender care,"
12437,BOOK II.,"A chouri in her hand,"
12438,BOOK II.,"As Chitrá,(281) ever fond in fair,"
12439,BOOK II.,Beside the Moon will stand.
12440,BOOK II.,"Him glorious with unborrowed light,"
12441,BOOK II.,"A liberal lord, of sunlike might,"
12442,BOOK II.,"Sumantra hailed in words like these,"
12443,BOOK II.,"Well skilled in gentle courtesies,"
12444,BOOK II.,"As, with joined hands in reverence raised,"
12445,BOOK II.,Upon the beauteous prince he gazed:
12446,BOOK II.,"""Happy Kausalyá! Blest is she,"
12447,BOOK II.,The Mother of a son like thee.
12448,BOOK II.,"Now rise, O Ráma, speed away."
12449,BOOK II.,Go to thy sire without delay:
12450,BOOK II.,For he and Queen Kaikeyí seek
12451,BOOK II.,"An interview with thee to speak."""
12452,BOOK II.,
12453,BOOK II.,"The lion-lord of men, the best"
12454,BOOK II.,"Of splendid heroes, thus addressed,"
12455,BOOK II.,To Sítá spake with joyful cheer:
12456,BOOK II.,"""The king and queen, my lady dear,"
12457,BOOK II.,"Touching the throning, for my sake"
12458,BOOK II.,Some salutary counsel take.
12459,BOOK II.,The lady of the full black eye
12460,BOOK II.,"Would fain her husband gratify,"
12461,BOOK II.,"And, all his purpose understood,"
12462,BOOK II.,Counsels the monarch to my good.
12463,BOOK II.,"A happy fate is mine, I ween,"
12464,BOOK II.,"When he, consulting with his queen,"
12465,BOOK II.,"Sumantra on this charge, intent"
12466,BOOK II.,"Upon my gain and good, has sent."
12467,BOOK II.,An envoy of so noble sort
12468,BOOK II.,Well suits the splendour of the court.
12469,BOOK II.,The consecration rite this day
12470,BOOK II.,Will join me in imperial sway.
12471,BOOK II.,"To meet the lord of earth, for so"
12472,BOOK II.,"His order bids me, I will go."
12473,BOOK II.,"Thou, lady, here in comfort stay,"
12474,BOOK II.,"And with thy maidens rest or play."""
12475,BOOK II.,
12476,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma spake. For meet reply
12477,BOOK II.,The lady of the large black eye
12478,BOOK II.,"Attended to the door her lord,"
12479,BOOK II.,And blessings on his head implored:
12480,BOOK II.,"""The majesty and royal state"
12481,BOOK II.,"Which holy Bráhmans venerate,"
12482,BOOK II.,The consecration and the rite
12483,BOOK II.,"Which sanctifies the ruler's might,"
12484,BOOK II.,And all imperial powers should be
12485,BOOK II.,"Thine by thy father's high decree,"
12486,BOOK II.,"As He, the worlds who formed and planned,"
12487,BOOK II.,The kingship gave to Indra's hand.
12488,BOOK II.,Then shall mine eyes my king adore
12489,BOOK II.,"When lustral rites and fast are o'er,"
12490,BOOK II.,And black deer's skin and roebuck's horn
12491,BOOK II.,Thy lordly limbs and hand adorn.
12492,BOOK II.,May He whose hands the thunder wield
12493,BOOK II.,Be in the east thy guard and shield;
12494,BOOK II.,"May Yáma's care the south befriend,"
12495,BOOK II.,And Varun's arm the west defend;
12496,BOOK II.,"And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,"
12497,BOOK II.,"The north with firm protection hold."""
12498,BOOK II.,
12499,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma spoke a kind farewell,"
12500,BOOK II.,And hailed the blessings as they fell
12501,BOOK II.,"From Sítá's gentle lips; and then,"
12502,BOOK II.,As a young lion from his den
12503,BOOK II.,"Descends the mountain's stony side,"
12504,BOOK II.,So from the hall the hero hied.
12505,BOOK II.,First Lakshman at the door he viewed
12506,BOOK II.,"Who stood in reverent attitude,"
12507,BOOK II.,Then to the central court he pressed
12508,BOOK II.,Where watched the friends who loved him best.
12509,BOOK II.,To all his dear companions there
12510,BOOK II.,He gave kind looks and greeting fair.
12511,BOOK II.,On to the lofty car that glowed
12512,BOOK II.,Like fire the royal tiger strode.
12513,BOOK II.,Bright as himself its silver shone:
12514,BOOK II.,A tiger's skin was laid thereon.
12515,BOOK II.,"With cloudlike thunder, as it rolled,"
12516,BOOK II.,"It flashed with gems and burnished gold,"
12517,BOOK II.,"And, like the sun's meridian blaze,"
12518,BOOK II.,Blinded the eye that none could gaze.
12519,BOOK II.,"Like youthful elephants, tall and strong,"
12520,BOOK II.,Fleet coursers whirled the car along:
12521,BOOK II.,In such a car the Thousand-eyed
12522,BOOK II.,Borne by swift horses loves to ride.
12523,BOOK II.,"So like Parjanya,(282) when he flies"
12524,BOOK II.,"Thundering through the autumn skies,"
12525,BOOK II.,"The hero from the palace sped,"
12526,BOOK II.,As leaves the moon some cloud o'erhead.
12527,BOOK II.,"Still close to Ráma Lakshman kept,"
12528,BOOK II.,"Behind him to the car he leapt,"
12529,BOOK II.,"And, watching with fraternal care,"
12530,BOOK II.,"Waved the long chouri's silver hair,"
12531,BOOK II.,As from the palace gate he came
12532,BOOK II.,Up rose the tumult of acclaim.
12533,BOOK II.,While loud huzza and jubilant shout
12534,BOOK II.,Pealed from the gathered myriads out.
12535,BOOK II.,"Then elephants, like mountains vast,"
12536,BOOK II.,"And steeds who all their kind surpassed,"
12537,BOOK II.,"Followed their lord by hundreds, nay"
12538,BOOK II.,"By thousands, led in long array."
12539,BOOK II.,"First marched a band of warriors trained,"
12540,BOOK II.,With sandal dust and aloe stained;
12541,BOOK II.,"Well armed was each with sword and bow,"
12542,BOOK II.,"And every breast with hope aglow,"
12543,BOOK II.,"And ever, as they onward went,"
12544,BOOK II.,"Shouts from the warrior train,"
12545,BOOK II.,And every sweet-toned instrument
12546,BOOK II.,Prolonged the minstrel strain.
12547,BOOK II.,"On passed the tamer of his foes,"
12548,BOOK II.,"While well clad dames, in crowded rows,"
12549,BOOK II.,"Each chamber lattice thronged to view,"
12550,BOOK II.,And chaplets on the hero threw.
12551,BOOK II.,"Then all, of peerless face and limb,"
12552,BOOK II.,"Sang Ráma's praise for love of him,"
12553,BOOK II.,"And blent their voices, soft and sweet,"
12554,BOOK II.,From palace high and crowded street:
12555,BOOK II.,"""Now, sure, Kausalyá's heart must swell"
12556,BOOK II.,"To see the son she loves so well,"
12557,BOOK II.,"Thee Ráma, thee, her joy and pride,"
12558,BOOK II.,"Triumphant o'er the realm preside."""
12559,BOOK II.,Then--for they knew his bride most fair
12560,BOOK II.,"Of all who part the soft dark hair,"
12561,BOOK II.,"His love, his life, possessed the whole"
12562,BOOK II.,Of her young hero's heart and soul:--
12563,BOOK II.,"""Be sure the lady's fate repays"
12564,BOOK II.,"Some mighty vow of ancient days,(283)"
12565,BOOK II.,For blest with Ráma's love is she
12566,BOOK II.,"As, with the Moon's, sweet Rohiní.""(284)"
12567,BOOK II.,
12568,BOOK II.,Such were the witching words that came
12569,BOOK II.,From lips of many a peerless dame
12570,BOOK II.,Crowding the palace roofs to greet
12571,BOOK II.,The hero as he gained the street.

12577,BOOK II.,
12578,BOOK II.,
12579,BOOK II.,"As Ráma, rendering blithe and gay"
12580,BOOK II.,"His loving friends, pursued his way,"
12581,BOOK II.,He saw on either hand a press
12582,BOOK II.,Of mingled people numberless.
12583,BOOK II.,"The royal street he traversed, where"
12584,BOOK II.,"Incense of aloe filled the air,"
12585,BOOK II.,"Where rose high palaces, that vied"
12586,BOOK II.,"With paly clouds, on either side;"
12587,BOOK II.,With flowers of myriad colours graced.
12588,BOOK II.,"And food for every varied taste,"
12589,BOOK II.,Bright as the glowing path o'erhead
12590,BOOK II.,"Which feet of Gods celestial tread,"
12591,BOOK II.,"Loud benedictions, sweet to hear,"
12592,BOOK II.,From countless voices soothed his ear.
12593,BOOK II.,While he to each gave due salute
12594,BOOK II.,His place and dignity to suit:
12595,BOOK II.,"""Be thou,"" the joyful people cried,"
12596,BOOK II.,"""Be thou our guardian, lord and guide."
12597,BOOK II.,"Throned and anointed king to-day,"
12598,BOOK II.,Thy feet set forth upon the way
12599,BOOK II.,"Wherein, each honoured as a God,"
12600,BOOK II.,Thy fathers and forefathers trod.
12601,BOOK II.,"Thy sire and his have graced the throne,"
12602,BOOK II.,And loving care to us have shown:
12603,BOOK II.,"Thus blest shall we and ours remain,"
12604,BOOK II.,Yea still more blest in Ráma's reign.
12605,BOOK II.,"No more of dainty fare we need,"
12606,BOOK II.,"And but one cherished object heed,"
12607,BOOK II.,That we may see our prince today
12608,BOOK II.,"Invested with imperial sway."""
12609,BOOK II.,
12610,BOOK II.,Such were the words and pleasant speech
12611,BOOK II.,"That Ráma heard, unmoved, from each"
12612,BOOK II.,"Of the dear friends around him spread,"
12613,BOOK II.,"As onward through the street he sped,"
12614,BOOK II.,For none could turn his eye or thought
12615,BOOK II.,"From the dear form his glances sought,"
12616,BOOK II.,With fruitless ardour forward cast
12617,BOOK II.,Even when Raghu's son had past.
12618,BOOK II.,"And he who saw not Ráma nigh,"
12619,BOOK II.,"Nor caught a look from Ráma's eye,"
12620,BOOK II.,"A mark for scorn and general blame,"
12621,BOOK II.,Reproached himself in bitter shame.
12622,BOOK II.,For to each class his equal mind
12623,BOOK II.,With sympathy and love inclined
12624,BOOK II.,"Most fully of the princely four,"
12625,BOOK II.,So greatest love to him they bore.
12626,BOOK II.,
12627,BOOK II.,His circling course the hero bent
12628,BOOK II.,"Round shrine and altar, reverent,"
12629,BOOK II.,"Round homes of Gods, where cross-roads met,"
12630,BOOK II.,Where many a sacred tree was set.
12631,BOOK II.,Near to his father's house he drew
12632,BOOK II.,"Like Indra's beautiful to view,"
12633,BOOK II.,And with the light his glory gave
12634,BOOK II.,Within the royal palace drave.
12635,BOOK II.,"Through three broad courts, where bowmen kept"
12636,BOOK II.,"Their watch and ward, his coursers swept,"
12637,BOOK II.,Then through the two remaining went
12638,BOOK II.,On foot the prince preëminent.
12639,BOOK II.,"Through all the courts the hero passed,"
12640,BOOK II.,And gained the ladies' bower at last;
12641,BOOK II.,"Then through the door alone withdrew,"
12642,BOOK II.,And left without his retinue.
12643,BOOK II.,When thus the monarch's noble boy
12644,BOOK II.,"Had gone his sire to meet,"
12645,BOOK II.,"The multitude, elate with joy,"
12646,BOOK II.,"Stood watching in the street,"
12647,BOOK II.,And his return with eager eyes
12648,BOOK II.,"Expected at the gates,"

12656,BOOK II.,
12657,BOOK II.,
12658,BOOK II.,With hopeless eye and pallid mien
12659,BOOK II.,There sat the monarch with the queen.
12660,BOOK II.,His father's feet with reverence due
12661,BOOK II.,"He clasped, and touched Kaikeyí's too."
12662,BOOK II.,"The king, with eyes still brimming o'er,"
12663,BOOK II.,Cried Ráma! and could do no more.
12664,BOOK II.,"His voice was choked, his eye was dim,"
12665,BOOK II.,He could not speak or look on him.
12666,BOOK II.,Then sudden fear made Ráma shake
12667,BOOK II.,"As though his foot had roused a snake,"
12668,BOOK II.,Soon as his eyes had seen the change
12669,BOOK II.,"So mournful, terrible, and strange."
12670,BOOK II.,"For there his reason well-nigh fled,"
12671,BOOK II.,"Sighing, with soul disquieted,"
12672,BOOK II.,"To torturing pangs a prey,"
12673,BOOK II.,"Dismayed, despairing, and distraught,"
12674,BOOK II.,In a fierce whirl of wildering thought
12675,BOOK II.,"The hapless monarch lay,"
12676,BOOK II.,Like Ocean wave-engarlanded
12677,BOOK II.,"Storm-driven from his tranquil bed,"
12678,BOOK II.,"The Sun-God in eclipse,"
12679,BOOK II.,"Or like a holy seer, heart-stirred"
12680,BOOK II.,"With anguish, when a lying word"
12681,BOOK II.,Has passed his heedless lips.
12682,BOOK II.,"The sight of his dear father, pained"
12683,BOOK II.,With woe and misery unexplained
12684,BOOK II.,"Filled Ráma with unrest,"
12685,BOOK II.,As Ocean's pulses rise and swell
12686,BOOK II.,When the great moon he loves so well
12687,BOOK II.,Shines full upon his breast.
12688,BOOK II.,"So grieving for his father's sake,"
12689,BOOK II.,To his own heart the hero spake:
12690,BOOK II.,"""Why will the king my sire to-day"
12691,BOOK II.,No kindly word of greeting say?
12692,BOOK II.,"At other times, though wroth he be,"
12693,BOOK II.,His eyes grow calm that look on me.
12694,BOOK II.,Then why does anguish wring his brow
12695,BOOK II.,"To see his well-beloved now?"""
12696,BOOK II.,"Sick and perplexed, distraught with woe,"
12697,BOOK II.,"To Queen Kaikeyí bowing low,"
12698,BOOK II.,"While pallor o'er his bright cheek spread,"
12699,BOOK II.,With humble reverence he said:
12700,BOOK II.,"""What have I done, unknown, amiss"
12701,BOOK II.,To make my father wroth like this?
12702,BOOK II.,"Declare it, O dear Queen, and win"
12703,BOOK II.,His pardon for my heedless sin.
12704,BOOK II.,Why is the sire I ever find
12705,BOOK II.,Filled with all love to-day unkind?
12706,BOOK II.,With eyes cast down and pallid cheek
12707,BOOK II.,This day alone he will not speak.
12708,BOOK II.,Or lies he prostrate neath the blow
12709,BOOK II.,Of fierce disease or sudden woe?
12710,BOOK II.,"For all our bliss is dashed with pain,"
12711,BOOK II.,And joy unmixt is hard to gain.
12712,BOOK II.,Does stroke of evil fortune smite
12713,BOOK II.,"Dear Bharat, charming to the sight,"
12714,BOOK II.,"Or on the brave Satrughna fall,"
12715,BOOK II.,"Or consorts, for he loves them all?"
12716,BOOK II.,"Against his words when I rebel,"
12717,BOOK II.,"Or fail to please the monarch well,"
12718,BOOK II.,"When deeds of mine his soul offend,"
12719,BOOK II.,That hour I pray my life may end.
12720,BOOK II.,How should a man to him who gave
12721,BOOK II.,His being and his life behave?
12722,BOOK II.,The sire to whom he owes his birth
12723,BOOK II.,Should be his deity on earth.
12724,BOOK II.,"Hast thou, by pride and folly moved,"
12725,BOOK II.,With bitter taunt the king reproved?
12726,BOOK II.,Has scorn of thine or cruel jest
12727,BOOK II.,To passion stirred his gentle breast?

12730,BOOK II.,
12731,BOOK II.,"Thus by the high-souled prince addressed,"
12732,BOOK II.,"Of Raghu's sons the chief and best,"
12733,BOOK II.,"She cast all ruth and shame aside,"
12734,BOOK II.,And bold with greedy words replied:
12735,BOOK II.,"""Not wrath, O Ráma, stirs the king,"
12736,BOOK II.,Nor misery stabs with sudden sting;
12737,BOOK II.,"One thought that fills his soul has he,"
12738,BOOK II.,But dares not speak for fear of thee.
12739,BOOK II.,"Thou art so dear, his lips refrain"
12740,BOOK II.,From words that might his darling pain.
12741,BOOK II.,"But thou, as duty bids, must still"
12742,BOOK II.,The promise of thy sire fulfil.
12743,BOOK II.,He who to me in days gone by
12744,BOOK II.,"Vouchsafed a boon with honours high,"
12745,BOOK II.,"Dares now, a king, his word regret,"
12746,BOOK II.,And caitiff-like disowns the debt.
12747,BOOK II.,The lord of men his promise gave
12748,BOOK II.,"To grant the boon that I might crave,"
12749,BOOK II.,And now a bridge would idly throw
12750,BOOK II.,When the dried stream has ceased to flow.
12751,BOOK II.,His faith the monarch must not break
12752,BOOK II.,"In wrath, or e'en for thy dear sake."
12753,BOOK II.,"From faith, as well the righteous know,"
12754,BOOK II.,Our virtue and our merits flow.
12755,BOOK II.,"Now, be they good or be they ill,"
12756,BOOK II.,Do thou thy father's words fulfil:
12757,BOOK II.,"Swear that his promise shall not fail,"
12758,BOOK II.,And I will tell thee all the tale.
12759,BOOK II.,"Yes, Ráma, when I hear that thou"
12760,BOOK II.,"Hast bound thee by thy father's vow,"
12761,BOOK II.,"Then, not till then, my lips shall speak,"
12762,BOOK II.,"Nor will he tell what boon I seek."""
12763,BOOK II.,
12764,BOOK II.,"He heard, and with a troubled breast"
12765,BOOK II.,This answer to the queen addressed:
12766,BOOK II.,"""Ah me, dear lady, canst thou deem"
12767,BOOK II.,That words like these thy lips beseem?
12768,BOOK II.,"I, at the bidding of my sire,"
12769,BOOK II.,"Would cast my body to the fire,"
12770,BOOK II.,"A deadly draught of poison drink,"
12771,BOOK II.,Or in the waves of ocean sink:
12772,BOOK II.,"If he command, it shall be done,--"
12773,BOOK II.,My father and my king in one.
12774,BOOK II.,Then speak and let me know the thing
12775,BOOK II.,So longed for by my lord the king.

12787,BOOK II.,"Of him I claim the ancient debt,"
12788,BOOK II.,"That Bharat on the throne be set,"
12789,BOOK II.,"And thou, O Ráma, go this day"
12790,BOOK II.,To Dandak forest far away.
12791,BOOK II.,"Now, Ráma, if thou wilt maintain"
12792,BOOK II.,"Thy father's faith without a stain,"
12793,BOOK II.,"And thine own truth and honour clear,"
12794,BOOK II.,"Then, best of men, my bidding hear."
12795,BOOK II.,"Do thou thy father's word obey,"
12796,BOOK II.,Nor from the pledge he gave me stray.
12797,BOOK II.,Thy life in Dandak forest spend
12798,BOOK II.,Till nine long years and five shall end.
12799,BOOK II.,Upon my Bharat's princely head
12800,BOOK II.,"Let consecrating drops be shed,"
12801,BOOK II.,With all the royal pomp for thee
12802,BOOK II.,Made ready by the king's decree.
12803,BOOK II.,Seek Dandak forest and resign
12804,BOOK II.,"Rites that would make the empire thine,"
12805,BOOK II.,For twice seven years of exile wear
12806,BOOK II.,The coat of bark and matted hair.
12807,BOOK II.,Then in thy stead let Bharat reign
12808,BOOK II.,"Lord of his royal sire's domain,"
12809,BOOK II.,"Rich in the fairest gems that shine,"
12810,BOOK II.,"Cars, elephants, and steeds, and kine."
12811,BOOK II.,The monarch mourns thy altered fate
12812,BOOK II.,And vails his brow compassionate:
12813,BOOK II.,Bowed down by bitter grief he lies
12814,BOOK II.,And dares not lift to thine his eyes.
12815,BOOK II.,"Obey his word: be firm and brave,"
12816,BOOK II.,"And with great truth the monarch save."""
12817,BOOK II.,"While thus with cruel words she spoke,"
12818,BOOK II.,No grief the noble youth betrayed;
12819,BOOK II.,"But forth the father's anguish broke,"
12820,BOOK II.,At his dear Ráma's lot dismayed.
12821,BOOK II.,
12822,BOOK II.,

12825,BOOK II.,Canto XIX. Ráma's Promise.
12826,BOOK II.,
12827,BOOK II.,
12828,BOOK II.,Calm and unmoved by threatened woe
12829,BOOK II.,The noble conqueror of the foe
12830,BOOK II.,"Answered the cruel words she spoke,"
12831,BOOK II.,Nor quailed beneath the murderous stroke:
12832,BOOK II.,
12833,BOOK II.,"""Yea, for my father's promise sake"
12834,BOOK II.,"I to the wood my way will take,"
12835,BOOK II.,And dwell a lonely exile there
12836,BOOK II.,In hermit dress with matted hair.
12837,BOOK II.,"One thing alone I fain would learn,"
12838,BOOK II.,Why is the king this day so stern?
12839,BOOK II.,"Why is the scourge of foes so cold,"
12840,BOOK II.,Nor gives me greeting as of old?
12841,BOOK II.,Now let not anger flush thy cheek:
12842,BOOK II.,"Before thy face the truth I speak,"
12843,BOOK II.,In hermit's coat with matted hair
12844,BOOK II.,To the wild wood will I repair.
12845,BOOK II.,"How can I fail his will to do,"
12846,BOOK II.,"Friend, master, grateful sovereign too?"
12847,BOOK II.,One only pang consumes my breast:
12848,BOOK II.,That his own lips have not expressed
12849,BOOK II.,"His will, nor made his longing known"
12850,BOOK II.,That Bharat should ascend the throne.
12851,BOOK II.,"To Bharat I would yield my wife,"
12852,BOOK II.,"My realm and wealth, mine own dear life,"
12853,BOOK II.,Unasked I fain would yield them all:
12854,BOOK II.,"More gladly at my father's call,"
12855,BOOK II.,More gladly when the gift may free
12856,BOOK II.,His honour and bring joy to thee.
12857,BOOK II.,"Thus, lady, his sad heart release"
12858,BOOK II.,"From the sore shame, and give him peace."
12859,BOOK II.,"But tell me, O, I pray thee, why"
12860,BOOK II.,"The lord of men, with downcast eye,"
12861,BOOK II.,"Lies prostrate thus, and one by one"
12862,BOOK II.,Down his pale cheek the tear-drops run.
12863,BOOK II.,Let couriers to thy father speed
12864,BOOK II.,"On horses of the swiftest breed,"
12865,BOOK II.,"And, by the mandate of the king,"
12866,BOOK II.,Thy Bharat to his presence bring.
12867,BOOK II.,My father's words I will not stay
12868,BOOK II.,"To question, but this very day"
12869,BOOK II.,"To Dandak's pathless wild will fare,"
12870,BOOK II.,"For twice seven years an exile there."""
12871,BOOK II.,
12872,BOOK II.,When Ráma thus had made reply
12873,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí's heart with joy beat high.
12874,BOOK II.,"She, trusting to the pledge she held,"
12875,BOOK II.,The youth's departure thus impelled:
12876,BOOK II.,"""'Tis well. Be messengers despatched"
12877,BOOK II.,"On coursers ne'er for fleetness matched,"
12878,BOOK II.,To seek my father's home and lead
12879,BOOK II.,My Bharat back with all their speed.
12880,BOOK II.,"And, Ráma, as I ween that thou"
12881,BOOK II.,"Wilt scarce endure to linger now,"
12882,BOOK II.,So surely it were wise and good
12883,BOOK II.,This hour to journey to the wood.
12884,BOOK II.,"And if, with shame cast down and weak,"
12885,BOOK II.,"No word to thee the king can speak,"
12886,BOOK II.,"Forgive, and from thy mind dismiss"
12887,BOOK II.,A trifle in an hour like this.
12888,BOOK II.,But till thy feet in rapid haste
12889,BOOK II.,"Have left the city for the waste,"
12890,BOOK II.,"And to the distant forest fled,"
12891,BOOK II.,"He will not bathe nor call for bread."""
12892,BOOK II.,
12893,BOOK II.,"""Woe! woe!"" from the sad monarch burst,"
12894,BOOK II.,In surging floods of grief immersed;
12895,BOOK II.,"Then swooning, with his wits astray,"
12896,BOOK II.,"Upon the gold-wrought couch he lay,"
12897,BOOK II.,And Ráma raised the aged king:
12898,BOOK II.,"But the stern queen, unpitying,"
12899,BOOK II.,"Checked not her needless words, nor spared"
12900,BOOK II.,"The hero for all speed prepared,"
12901,BOOK II.,"But urged him with her bitter tongue,"
12902,BOOK II.,"Like a good horse with lashes stung,"
12903,BOOK II.,She spoke her shameful speech. Serene
12904,BOOK II.,"He heard the fury of the queen,"
12905,BOOK II.,And to her words so vile and dread
12906,BOOK II.,"Gently, unmoved in mind, he said:"
12907,BOOK II.,"""I would not in this world remain"
12908,BOOK II.,"A grovelling thrall to paltry gain,"
12909,BOOK II.,"But duty's path would fain pursue,"
12910,BOOK II.,True as the saints themselves are true.
12911,BOOK II.,From death itself I would not fly
12912,BOOK II.,"My father's wish to gratify,"
12913,BOOK II.,What deed soe'er his loving son
12914,BOOK II.,"May do to please him, think it done."
12915,BOOK II.,"Amid all duties, Queen, I count"
12916,BOOK II.,"This duty first and paramount,"
12917,BOOK II.,"That sons, obedient, aye fulfil"
12918,BOOK II.,Their honoured fathers' word and will.
12919,BOOK II.,"Without his word, if thou decree,"
12920,BOOK II.,"Forth to the forest will I flee,"
12921,BOOK II.,And there shall fourteen years be spent
12922,BOOK II.,Mid lonely wilds in banishment.
12923,BOOK II.,Methinks thou couldst not hope to find
12924,BOOK II.,"One spark of virtue in my mind,"
12925,BOOK II.,"If thou, whose wish is still my lord,"
12926,BOOK II.,Hast for this grace the king implored.
12927,BOOK II.,"This day I go, but, ere we part,"
12928,BOOK II.,"Must cheer my Sítá's tender heart,"
12929,BOOK II.,To my dear mother bid farewell;
12930,BOOK II.,"Then to the woods, a while to dwell."
12931,BOOK II.,"With thee, O Queen, the care must rest"
12932,BOOK II.,"That Bharat hear his sire's behest,"
12933,BOOK II.,"And guard the land with righteous sway,"
12934,BOOK II.,"For such the law that lives for aye."""
12935,BOOK II.,
12936,BOOK II.,"In speechless woe the father heard,"
12937,BOOK II.,"Wept with loud cries, but spoke no word."
12938,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma touched his senseless feet,"
12939,BOOK II.,"And hers, for honour most unmeet;"
12940,BOOK II.,"Round both his circling steps he bent,"
12941,BOOK II.,Then from the bower the hero went.
12942,BOOK II.,Soon as he reached the gate he found
12943,BOOK II.,His dear companions gathered round.
12944,BOOK II.,Behind him came Sumitrá's child
12945,BOOK II.,With weeping eyes so sad and wild.
12946,BOOK II.,Then saw he all that rich array
12947,BOOK II.,Of vases for the glorious day.
12948,BOOK II.,"Round them with reverent stops he paced,"
12949,BOOK II.,"Nor vailed his eye, nor moved in haste."
12950,BOOK II.,The loss of empire could not dim
12951,BOOK II.,The glory that encompassed him.
12952,BOOK II.,So will the Lord of Cooling Rays(286)
12953,BOOK II.,"On whom the world delights to gaze,"
12954,BOOK II.,Through the great love of all retain
12955,BOOK II.,Sweet splendour in the time of wane.
12956,BOOK II.,Now to the exile's lot resigned
12957,BOOK II.,He left the rule of earth behind:
12958,BOOK II.,As though all worldly cares he spurned
12959,BOOK II.,No trouble was in him discerned.
12960,BOOK II.,"The chouries that for kings are used,"
12961,BOOK II.,"And white umbrella, he refused,"
12962,BOOK II.,"Dismissed his chariot and his men,"
12963,BOOK II.,And every friend and citizen.
12964,BOOK II.,"He ruled his senses, nor betrayed"
12965,BOOK II.,"The grief that on his bosom weighed,"
12966,BOOK II.,And thus his mother's mansion sought
12967,BOOK II.,To tell the mournful news he brought.
12968,BOOK II.,Nor could the gay-clad people there
12969,BOOK II.,"Who flocked round Ráma true and fair,"
12970,BOOK II.,One sign of altered fortune trace
12971,BOOK II.,Upon the splendid hero's face.
12972,BOOK II.,"Nor had the chieftain, mighty-armed,"
12973,BOOK II.,"Lost the bright look all hearts that charmed,"
12974,BOOK II.,As e'en from autumn moons is thrown
12975,BOOK II.,A splendour which is all their own.
12976,BOOK II.,With his sweet voice the hero spoke
12977,BOOK II.,"Saluting all the gathered folk,"
12978,BOOK II.,Then righteous-souled and great in fame
12979,BOOK II.,Close to his mother's house he came.
12980,BOOK II.,"Lakshman the brave, his brother's peer"
12981,BOOK II.,"In princely virtues, followed near,"
12982,BOOK II.,"Sore troubled, but resolved to show"
12983,BOOK II.,No token of his secret woe.
12984,BOOK II.,Thus to the palace Ráma went
12985,BOOK II.,Where all were gay with hope and joy;
12986,BOOK II.,But well he knew the dire event
12987,BOOK II.,"That hope would mar, that bliss destroy."
12988,BOOK II.,So to his grief he would not yield
12989,BOOK II.,"Lest the sad change their hearts might rend,"
12990,BOOK II.,"And, the dread tiding unrevealed,"
12991,BOOK II.,Spared from the blow each faithful friend.

13000,BOOK II.,"Sped from the bower that lord of men,"
13001,BOOK II.,Up from the weeping women went
13002,BOOK II.,A mighty wail and wild lament:
13003,BOOK II.,"""Ah, he who ever freely did"
13004,BOOK II.,"His duty ere his sire could bid,"
13005,BOOK II.,"Our refuge and our sure defence,"
13006,BOOK II.,"This day will go an exile hence,"
13007,BOOK II.,He on Kausalyá loves to wait
13008,BOOK II.,"Most tender and affectionate,"
13009,BOOK II.,"And as he treats his mother, thus"
13010,BOOK II.,From childhood has he treated us.
13011,BOOK II.,"On themes that sting he will not speak,"
13012,BOOK II.,And when reviled is calm and meek.

13019,BOOK II.,
13020,BOOK II.,"Thus in their woe, like kine bereaved"
13021,BOOK II.,"Of their young calves,(287) the ladies grieved,"
13022,BOOK II.,And ever as they wept and wailed
13023,BOOK II.,With keen reproach the king assailed.
13024,BOOK II.,"Their lamentation, mixed with tears,"
13025,BOOK II.,"Smote with new grief the monarch's ears,"
13026,BOOK II.,"Who, burnt with woe too great to bear,"
13027,BOOK II.,Fell on his couch and fainted there.
13028,BOOK II.,
13029,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, smitten with the pain"
13030,BOOK II.,"His heaving heart could scarce restrain,"
13031,BOOK II.,Groaned like an elephant and strode
13032,BOOK II.,With Lakshman to the queen's abode.
13033,BOOK II.,"A warder there, whose hoary eld"
13034,BOOK II.,"In honour high by all was held,"
13035,BOOK II.,"Guarding the mansion, sat before"
13036,BOOK II.,"The portal, girt with many more."
13037,BOOK II.,"Swift to their feet the warders sprang,"
13038,BOOK II.,"And loud the acclamation rang,"
13039,BOOK II.,"Hail, Ráma! as to him they bent,"
13040,BOOK II.,Of victor chiefs preëminent.
13041,BOOK II.,"One court he passed, and in the next"
13042,BOOK II.,"Saw, masters of each Veda text,"
13043,BOOK II.,"A crowd of Bráhmans, good and sage,"
13044,BOOK II.,Dear to the king for lore and age.
13045,BOOK II.,"To these he bowed his reverent head,"
13046,BOOK II.,Thence to the court beyond he sped.
13047,BOOK II.,"Old dames and tender girls, their care"
13048,BOOK II.,"To keep the doors, were stationed there."
13049,BOOK II.,"And all, when Ráma came in view,"
13050,BOOK II.,"Delighted to the chamber flew,"
13051,BOOK II.,To bear to Queen Kausalyá's ear
13052,BOOK II.,The tidings that she loved to hear.
13053,BOOK II.,"The queen, on rites and prayer intent,"
13054,BOOK II.,"In careful watch the night had spent,"
13055,BOOK II.,"And at the dawn, her son to aid,"
13056,BOOK II.,To Vishnu holy offerings made.
13057,BOOK II.,"Firm in her vows, serenely glad,"
13058,BOOK II.,"In robes of spotless linen clad,"
13059,BOOK II.,"As texts prescribe, with grace implored,"
13060,BOOK II.,Her offerings in the fire she poured.
13061,BOOK II.,"Within her splendid bower he came,"
13062,BOOK II.,And saw her feed the sacred flame.
13063,BOOK II.,"There oil, and grain, and vases stood,"
13064,BOOK II.,"With wreaths, and curds, and cates, and wood,"
13065,BOOK II.,"And milk, and sesamum, and rice,"

13069,BOOK II.,"In robes of purest white arrayed,"
13070,BOOK II.,To Lakshmí Queen drink-offerings paid.
13071,BOOK II.,"So long away, she flew to meet"
13072,BOOK II.,The darling of her soul:
13073,BOOK II.,So runs a mare with eager feet
13074,BOOK II.,To welcome back her foal.
13075,BOOK II.,He with his firm support upheld
13076,BOOK II.,"The queen, as near she drew,"
13077,BOOK II.,"And, by maternal love impelled,"
13078,BOOK II.,Her arms around him threw.
13079,BOOK II.,"Her hero son, her matchless boy"
13080,BOOK II.,She kissed upon the head:
13081,BOOK II.,She blessed him in her pride and joy
13082,BOOK II.,"With tender words, and said:"
13083,BOOK II.,"""Be like thy royal sires of old,"

13091,BOOK II.,
13092,BOOK II.,"She spoke. He took the proffered seat,"
13093,BOOK II.,"And as she pressed her son to eat,"
13094,BOOK II.,"Raised reverent bands, and, touched with shame,"
13095,BOOK II.,Made answer to the royal dame:
13096,BOOK II.,"""Dear lady, thou hast yet to know"
13097,BOOK II.,"That danger threats, and heavy woe:"
13098,BOOK II.,A grief that will with sore distress
13099,BOOK II.,"On Sítá, thee, and Lakshman press."
13100,BOOK II.,What need of seats have such as I?
13101,BOOK II.,This day to Dandak wood I fly.
13102,BOOK II.,"The hour is come, a time, unmeet"
13103,BOOK II.,For silken couch and gilded seat.
13104,BOOK II.,"I must to lonely wilds repair,"
13105,BOOK II.,"Abstain from flesh, and living there"
13106,BOOK II.,"On roots, fruit, honey, hermit's food,"
13107,BOOK II.,Pass twice seven years in solitude.
13108,BOOK II.,To Bharat's hand the king will yield
13109,BOOK II.,"The regent power I thought to wield,"
13110,BOOK II.,"And me, a hermit, will he send"
13111,BOOK II.,"My days in Dandak wood to spend."""
13112,BOOK II.,
13113,BOOK II.,As when the woodman's axe has lopped
13114,BOOK II.,"A Sal branch in the grove, she dropped:"
13115,BOOK II.,So from the skies a Goddess falls
13116,BOOK II.,Ejected from her radiant halls.
13117,BOOK II.,
13118,BOOK II.,"When Ráma saw her lying low,"
13119,BOOK II.,"Prostrate by too severe a blow,"
13120,BOOK II.,Around her form his arms he wound
13121,BOOK II.,And raised her fainting from the ground.
13122,BOOK II.,His hand upheld her like a mare
13123,BOOK II.,"Who feels her load too sore to bear,"
13124,BOOK II.,"And sinks upon the way o'ertoiled,"
13125,BOOK II.,And all her limbs with dust are soiled.
13126,BOOK II.,He soothed her in her wild distress
13127,BOOK II.,With loving touch and soft caress.
13128,BOOK II.,"She, meet for highest fortune, eyed"
13129,BOOK II.,"The hero watching by her side,"
13130,BOOK II.,"And thus, while Lakshman bent to hear,"
13131,BOOK II.,Addressed her son with many a tear!
13132,BOOK II.,"""If, Ráma, thou had ne'er been born"
13133,BOOK II.,"My child to make thy mother mourn,"
13134,BOOK II.,"Though reft of joy, a childless queen,"
13135,BOOK II.,Such woe as this I ne'er had seen.
13136,BOOK II.,Though to the childless wife there clings
13137,BOOK II.,"One sorrow armed with keenest stings,"
13138,BOOK II.,"""No child have I: no child have I,"""
13139,BOOK II.,No second misery prompts the sigh.
13140,BOOK II.,"When long I sought, alas, in vain,"
13141,BOOK II.,"My husband's love and bliss to gain,"
13142,BOOK II.,In Ráma all my hopes I set
13143,BOOK II.,And dreamed I might be happy yet.
13144,BOOK II.,"I, of the consorts first and best,"
13145,BOOK II.,"Must bear my rivals' taunt and jest,"
13146,BOOK II.,"And brook, though better far than they,"
13147,BOOK II.,The soul distressing words they say.
13148,BOOK II.,What woman can be doomed to pine
13149,BOOK II.,"In misery more sore than mine,"
13150,BOOK II.,Whose hopeless days must still be spent
13151,BOOK II.,In grief that ends not and lament?
13152,BOOK II.,They scorned me when my son was nigh;
13153,BOOK II.,When he is banished I must die.
13154,BOOK II.,"Me, whom my husband never prized,"
13155,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí's retinue despised
13156,BOOK II.,"With boundless insolence, though she"
13157,BOOK II.,Tops not in rank nor equals me.
13158,BOOK II.,"And they who do me service yet,"
13159,BOOK II.,"Nor old allegiance quite forget,"
13160,BOOK II.,"Whene'er they see Kaikeyí's son,"
13161,BOOK II.,With silent lips my glances shun.
13162,BOOK II.,"How, O my darling, shall I brook"
13163,BOOK II.,"Each menace of Kaikeyí's look,"
13164,BOOK II.,"And listen, in my low estate,"
13165,BOOK II.,To taunts of one so passionate?
13166,BOOK II.,For seventeen years since thou wast born
13167,BOOK II.,"I sat and watched, ah me, forlorn!"
13168,BOOK II.,Hoping some blessed day to see
13169,BOOK II.,Deliverance from my woes by thee.
13170,BOOK II.,"Now comes this endless grief and wrong,"
13171,BOOK II.,"So dire I cannot bear it long,"
13172,BOOK II.,"Sinking, with age and sorrow worn,"
13173,BOOK II.,Beneath my rivals' taunts and scorn.
13174,BOOK II.,How shall I pass in dark distress
13175,BOOK II.,My long lone days of wretchedness
13176,BOOK II.,"Without my Ráma's face, as bright"
13177,BOOK II.,As the full moon to cheer my sight?
13178,BOOK II.,"Alas, my cares thy steps to train,"
13179,BOOK II.,"And fasts, and vows, and prayers are vain."
13180,BOOK II.,"Hard, hard, I ween, must be this heart"

13182,BOOK II.,"As some great river bank, when first"
13183,BOOK II.,The floods of Rain-time on it burst.
13184,BOOK II.,"No, Fate that speeds not will not slay,"
13185,BOOK II.,"Nor Yama's halls vouchsafe me room,"
13186,BOOK II.,"Or, like a lion's weeping prey,"
13187,BOOK II.,Death now had borne me to my doom.
13188,BOOK II.,Hard is my heart and wrought of steel
13189,BOOK II.,"That breaks not with the crushing blow,"
13190,BOOK II.,Or in the pangs this day I feel
13191,BOOK II.,My lifeless frame had sunk below.
13192,BOOK II.,"Death waits his hour, nor takes me now:"
13193,BOOK II.,"But this sad thought augments my pain,"

13292,BOOK II.,"Thy duty's path would still pursue,"
13293,BOOK II.,The highest duty bids thee stay
13294,BOOK II.,And thus thy mother's voice obey.
13295,BOOK II.,Thus Kasyap's great ascetic son
13296,BOOK II.,A seat among the Immortals won:
13297,BOOK II.,"In his own home, subdued, he stayed,"
13298,BOOK II.,And honour to his mother paid.

13310,BOOK II.,Nor life without my son endure.
13311,BOOK II.,Then it will be thy fate to dwell
13312,BOOK II.,In depth of world-detested hell.
13313,BOOK II.,As Ocean in the olden time
13314,BOOK II.,Was guilty of an impious crime
13315,BOOK II.,That marked the lord of each fair flood
13316,BOOK II.,"As one who spills a Bráhman's blood.""(288)"
13317,BOOK II.,
13318,BOOK II.,"Thus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:"
13319,BOOK II.,Then righteous Ráma thus replied:
13320,BOOK II.,"""I have no power to slight or break"
13321,BOOK II.,Commandments which my father spake.
13322,BOOK II.,"I bend my head, dear lady, low,"

13324,BOOK II.,"Once Kandu, mighty saint, who made"
13325,BOOK II.,"His dwelling in the forest shade,"
13326,BOOK II.,A cow--and duty's claims he knew--
13327,BOOK II.,"Obedient to his father, slew."
13328,BOOK II.,"And in the line from which we spring,"
13329,BOOK II.,"When ordered by their sire the king,"
13330,BOOK II.,"Through earth the sons of Sagar cleft,"
13331,BOOK II.,And countless things of life bereft.(289)
13332,BOOK II.,So Jamadagní's son(290) obeyed
13333,BOOK II.,"His sire, when in the wood he laid"
13334,BOOK II.,"His hand upon his axe, and smote"
13335,BOOK II.,Through Renuká his mother's throat.
13336,BOOK II.,The deeds of these and more beside.
13337,BOOK II.,"Peers of the Gods, my steps shall guide,"
13338,BOOK II.,And resolute will I fulfil
13339,BOOK II.,"My father's word, my father's will."
13340,BOOK II.,"Nor I, O Queen, unsanctioned tread"
13341,BOOK II.,"This righteous path, by duty led:"
13342,BOOK II.,The road my footsteps journey o'er
13343,BOOK II.,Was traversed by the great of yore.
13344,BOOK II.,This high command which all accept
13345,BOOK II.,"Shall faithfully by me be kept,"
13346,BOOK II.,For duty ne'er will him forsake
13347,BOOK II.,"Who fears his sire's command to break."""
13348,BOOK II.,
13349,BOOK II.,Thus to his mother wild with grief:
13350,BOOK II.,Then thus to Lakshman spake the chief
13351,BOOK II.,"Of those by whom the bow is bent,"
13352,BOOK II.,"Mid all who speak, most eloquent:"
13353,BOOK II.,"""I know what love for me thou hast,"
13354,BOOK II.,What firm devotion unsurpassed:
13355,BOOK II.,"Thy valour and thy worth I know,"
13356,BOOK II.,And glory that appals the foe.
13357,BOOK II.,"Blest youth, my mother's woe is great,"
13358,BOOK II.,It bends her 'neath its matchless weight:
13359,BOOK II.,"No claims will she, with blinded eyes,"
13360,BOOK II.,Of truth and patience recognize.
13361,BOOK II.,"For duty is supreme in place,"
13362,BOOK II.,And truth is duty's noblest base.
13363,BOOK II.,Obedient to my sire's behest
13364,BOOK II.,I serve the cause of duty best.
13365,BOOK II.,For man should truly do whate'er
13366,BOOK II.,"To mother, Bráhman, sire, he sware:"
13367,BOOK II.,"He must in duty's path remain,"
13368,BOOK II.,Nor let his word be pledged in vain.
13369,BOOK II.,"And, O my brother, how can I"
13370,BOOK II.,Obedience to this charge deny?
13371,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí's tongue my purpose spurred,"
13372,BOOK II.,But 'twas my sire who gave the word.
13373,BOOK II.,Cast these unholy thoughts aside
13374,BOOK II.,Which smack of war and Warriors' pride;
13375,BOOK II.,"To duty's call, not wrath attend,"
13376,BOOK II.,"And tread the path which I commend."""
13377,BOOK II.,
13378,BOOK II.,Ráma by fond affection moved
13379,BOOK II.,His brother Lakshman thus reproved;
13380,BOOK II.,Then with joined hands and reverent head
13381,BOOK II.,Again to Queen Kausalyá said:
13382,BOOK II.,
13383,BOOK II.,"""I needs must go--do thou consent--"
13384,BOOK II.,To the wild wood in banishment.
13385,BOOK II.,"O give me, by my life I pray,"
13386,BOOK II.,Thy blessing ere I go away.
13387,BOOK II.,"I, when the promised years are o'er,"
13388,BOOK II.,Shall see Ayodhyá's town once more.
13389,BOOK II.,"Then, mother dear, thy tears restrain,"
13390,BOOK II.,Nor let thy heart be wrung by pain:
13391,BOOK II.,"In time, my father's will obeyed,"
13392,BOOK II.,Shall I return from greenwood shade.
13393,BOOK II.,"My dear Videhan, thou, and I,"
13394,BOOK II.,"Lakshman, Sumitrá, feel this tie,"
13395,BOOK II.,"And must my father's word obey,"
13396,BOOK II.,As duty bids that rules for aye.
13397,BOOK II.,"Thy preparations now forgo,"
13398,BOOK II.,"And lock within thy breast thy woe,"
13399,BOOK II.,Nor be my pious wish withstood
13400,BOOK II.,"To go an exile to the wood."""
13401,BOOK II.,
13402,BOOK II.,Calm and unmoved the prince explained
13403,BOOK II.,"His duty's claim and purpose high,"
13404,BOOK II.,"The mother life and sense regained,"
13405,BOOK II.,Looked on her son and made reply:
13406,BOOK II.,"""If reverence be thy father's due,"

13408,BOOK II.,"Go not, my charge I thus renew,"
13409,BOOK II.,"Nor leave me here in woe to pine,"
13410,BOOK II.,"What were such lonely life to me,"
13411,BOOK II.,"Rites to the shades, or deathless lot?"
13412,BOOK II.,"More dear, my son, one hour with thee"
13413,BOOK II.,"Than all the world where thou art not."""
13414,BOOK II.,"As bursts to view, when brands blaze high,"
13415,BOOK II.,"Some elephant concealed by night,"
13416,BOOK II.,"So, when he heard his mother's cry,"
13417,BOOK II.,Burnt Ráma's grief with fiercer might.
13418,BOOK II.,"Thus to the queen, half senseless still,"
13419,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman, burnt with heart-felt pain,"
13420,BOOK II.,"True to the right, with steadfast will,"
13421,BOOK II.,His duteous speech he spoke again:
13422,BOOK II.,"""Brother, I know thy loving mind,"
13423,BOOK II.,"Thy valour and thy truth I know,"
13424,BOOK II.,But now to claims of duty blind
13425,BOOK II.,Thou and my mother swell my woe.
13426,BOOK II.,The fruits of deeds in human life
13427,BOOK II.,"Make love, gain, duty, manifest,"
13428,BOOK II.,Dear when they meet as some fond wife
13429,BOOK II.,With her sweet babes upon her breast.
13430,BOOK II.,But man to duty first should turn
13431,BOOK II.,Whene'er the three are not combined:
13432,BOOK II.,"For those who heed but gain we spurn,"
13433,BOOK II.,And those to pleasure all resigned.
13434,BOOK II.,Shall then the virtuous disobey
13435,BOOK II.,"Hosts of an aged king and sire,"
13436,BOOK II.,"Though feverous joy that father sway,"
13437,BOOK II.,Or senseless love or causeless ire?
13438,BOOK II.,"I have no power, commanded thus,"
13439,BOOK II.,To slight his promise and decree:
13440,BOOK II.,"The honoured sire of both of us,"
13441,BOOK II.,My mother's lord and life is he.
13442,BOOK II.,"Shall she, while yet the holy king"
13443,BOOK II.,"Is living, on the right intent,--"
13444,BOOK II.,"Shall she, like some poor widowed thing,"
13445,BOOK II.,Go forth with me to banishment?
13446,BOOK II.,"Now, mother, speed thy parting son,"
13447,BOOK II.,"And let thy blessing soothe my pain,"
13448,BOOK II.,"That I may turn, mine exile done,"
13449,BOOK II.,"Like King Yayáti, home again."
13450,BOOK II.,"Fair glory and the fruit she gives,"
13451,BOOK II.,For lust of sway I ne'er will slight:
13452,BOOK II.,"What, for the span a mortal lives."
13453,BOOK II.,"Were rule of faith without the right?"""
13454,BOOK II.,"He soothed her thus, firm to the last"
13455,BOOK II.,His counsel to his brother told:
13456,BOOK II.,"Then round the queen in reverence passed,"

13467,BOOK II.,"To his dear brother next he turned,"
13468,BOOK II.,"Whose glaring eyes with fury burned,"
13469,BOOK II.,"Indignant, panting like a snake,"
13470,BOOK II.,And thus again his counsel spake:
13471,BOOK II.,"""Thine anger and thy grief restrain,"
13472,BOOK II.,And firm in duty's path remain.
13473,BOOK II.,"Dear brother, lay thy scorn aside,"

13475,BOOK II.,Thy ready zeal and thoughtful care
13476,BOOK II.,"To aid what rites should grace the heir,--"
13477,BOOK II.,These 'tis another's now to ask;
13478,BOOK II.,"Come, gird thee for thy noble task,"
13479,BOOK II.,That Bharat's throning rites may he
13480,BOOK II.,Graced with the things prepared for me.
13481,BOOK II.,And with thy gentle care provide
13482,BOOK II.,"That her fond heart, now sorely tried"
13483,BOOK II.,"With fear and longing for my sake,"
13484,BOOK II.,With doubt and dread may never ache.
13485,BOOK II.,To know that thoughts of coming ill
13486,BOOK II.,One hour that tender bosom fill
13487,BOOK II.,With agony and dark despair
13488,BOOK II.,Is grief too great for me to bear.
13489,BOOK II.,"I cannot, brother, call to mind"
13490,BOOK II.,"One wilful fault or undesigned,"

13493,BOOK II.,"The right my father keeps in view,"
13494,BOOK II.,"In promise, word, and action true;"
13495,BOOK II.,"Let him then all his fear dismiss,"
13496,BOOK II.,Nor dread the loss of future bliss.
13497,BOOK II.,He fears his truth herein will fail:
13498,BOOK II.,Hence bitter thoughts his heart assail.
13499,BOOK II.,"He trembles lest the rites proceed,"
13500,BOOK II.,And at his pangs my heart should bleed.
13501,BOOK II.,"So now this earnest wish is mine,"
13502,BOOK II.,"The consecration to resign,"
13503,BOOK II.,And from this city turn away
13504,BOOK II.,To the wild wood with no delay.
13505,BOOK II.,My banishment to-day will free
13506,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí from her cares, that she,"
13507,BOOK II.,"At last contented and elate,"
13508,BOOK II.,May Bharat's throning celebrate.
13509,BOOK II.,"Then will the lady's trouble cease,"
13510,BOOK II.,"Then will her heart have joy and peace,"
13511,BOOK II.,When wandering in the wood I wear
13512,BOOK II.,"Deerskin, and bark, and matted hair."
13513,BOOK II.,Nor shall by me his heart be grieved
13514,BOOK II.,"Whose choice approved, whose mind conceived"
13515,BOOK II.,"This counsel which I follow. No,"
13516,BOOK II.,Forth to the forest will I go.
13517,BOOK II.,"'Tis Fate, Sumitrás son, confess,"
13518,BOOK II.,That sends me to the wilderness.
13519,BOOK II.,'Tis Fate alone that gives away
13520,BOOK II.,To other hands the royal sway.
13521,BOOK II.,How could Kaikeyí's purpose bring
13522,BOOK II.,"On me this pain and suffering,"
13523,BOOK II.,Were not her change of heart decreed
13524,BOOK II.,By Fate whose will commands the deed?
13525,BOOK II.,I know my filial love has been
13526,BOOK II.,"The same throughout for every queen,"
13527,BOOK II.,And with the same affection she
13528,BOOK II.,Has treated both her son and me.
13529,BOOK II.,Her shameful words of cruel spite
13530,BOOK II.,"To stay the consecrating rite,"
13531,BOOK II.,"And drive me banished from the throne,--"
13532,BOOK II.,"These I ascribe to Fate alone,"
13533,BOOK II.,"How could she, born of royal race,"
13534,BOOK II.,"Whom nature decks with fairest grace,"
13535,BOOK II.,Speak like a dame of low degree
13536,BOOK II.,Before the king to torture me?
13537,BOOK II.,"But Fate, which none may comprehend,"
13538,BOOK II.,"To which all life must bow and bend,"
13539,BOOK II.,"In her and me its power has shown,"
13540,BOOK II.,And all my hopes are overthrown.
13541,BOOK II.,"What man, Sumitrá's darling, may"
13542,BOOK II.,"Contend with Fate's resistless sway,"
13543,BOOK II.,Whose all-commanding power we find
13544,BOOK II.,Our former deeds alone can bind?
13545,BOOK II.,"Our life and death, our joy and pain,"
13546,BOOK II.,"Anger and fear, and loss and gain,"
13547,BOOK II.,"Each thing that is, in every state,"
13548,BOOK II.,All is the work of none but Fate.
13549,BOOK II.,"E'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal,"
13550,BOOK II.,"When once the stroke of Fate they feel,"
13551,BOOK II.,"In sternest vows no more engage,"
13552,BOOK II.,And fall enslaved by love and rage.
13553,BOOK II.,So now the sudden stroke whose weight
13554,BOOK II.,"Descends unlooked for, comes of Fate,"
13555,BOOK II.,And with unpitying might destroys
13556,BOOK II.,The promise of commencing joys.
13557,BOOK II.,Weigh this true counsel in thy soul:
13558,BOOK II.,With thy firm heart thy heart control;
13559,BOOK II.,"Then, brother, thou wilt cease to grieve"
13560,BOOK II.,For hindered rites which now I leave.
13561,BOOK II.,"So cast thy needless grief away,"
13562,BOOK II.,And strictly my commands obey.
13563,BOOK II.,"Those preparations check with speed,"
13564,BOOK II.,Nor let my throning rites proceed.
13565,BOOK II.,Those urns that stand prepared to shed
13566,BOOK II.,"King-making drops upon my head,"
13567,BOOK II.,"Shall, with their pure lustrations now"
13568,BOOK II.,Inaugurate my hermit's vow.
13569,BOOK II.,Yet what have I to do with things
13570,BOOK II.,That touch the state and pomp of kings?
13571,BOOK II.,These hands of mine shall water take
13572,BOOK II.,To sanctify the vow I make.
13573,BOOK II.,"Now Lakshman, let thy heart no more"
13574,BOOK II.,My fortune changed and lost deplore.
13575,BOOK II.,A forest life more joys may bring
13576,BOOK II.,"Than those that wait upon a king,"
13577,BOOK II.,Now though her arts successful mar
13578,BOOK II.,"My consecrating rite,"
13579,BOOK II.,Let not the youngest queen too far
13580,BOOK II.,Thy jealous fear excite.
13581,BOOK II.,Nor let one thought suggesting ill

13605,BOOK II.,He raised and shook his hand(291) aloft.
13606,BOOK II.,Now turned his neck to left and right
13607,BOOK II.,"Now bent, now raised its stately height."
13608,BOOK II.,Now in his rage that sword he felt
13609,BOOK II.,"Which mangling wounds to foemen dealt,"
13610,BOOK II.,"With sidelong glance his brother eyed,"
13611,BOOK II.,And thus in burning words replied:
13612,BOOK II.,"""Thy rash resolve, thy eager haste,"
13613,BOOK II.,"Thy mighty fear, are all misplaced:"
13614,BOOK II.,"No room is here for duty's claim,"
13615,BOOK II.,No cause to dread the people's blame.
13616,BOOK II.,Can one as brave as thou consent
13617,BOOK II.,To use a coward's argument?
13618,BOOK II.,The glory of the Warrior race
13619,BOOK II.,With craven speech his lips debase?
13620,BOOK II.,"Can one like thee so falsely speak,"
13621,BOOK II.,"Exalting Fate, confessed so weak?"
13622,BOOK II.,"Canst thou, undoubting still restrain?"
13623,BOOK II.,Suspicions of those sinful twain?
13624,BOOK II.,"Canst thou, most duteous, fail to know"
13625,BOOK II.,Their hearts are set on duty's show?
13626,BOOK II.,"They with deceit have set their trains,"
13627,BOOK II.,And now the fruit rewards their pains.
13628,BOOK II.,"Had they not long ago agreed,"
13629,BOOK II.,"O Ráma, on this treacherous deed,"
13630,BOOK II.,"That promised boon, so long retained,"
13631,BOOK II.,He erst had given and she had gained.
13632,BOOK II.,"I cannot, O my brother, bear"
13633,BOOK II.,To see another throned as heir
13634,BOOK II.,With rites which all our people hate:
13635,BOOK II.,"Then, O, this passion tolerate."
13636,BOOK II.,This vaunted duty which can guide
13637,BOOK II.,"Thy steps from wisdom's path aside,"
13638,BOOK II.,"And change the counsel of thy breast,"
13639,BOOK II.,"O lofty-hearted, I detest."
13640,BOOK II.,"Wilt thou, when power and might are thine,"
13641,BOOK II.,Submit to this abhorred design?
13642,BOOK II.,"Thy father's impious hest fulfil,"
13643,BOOK II.,That vassal of Kaikeyí's will?
13644,BOOK II.,"But if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,"
13645,BOOK II.,"Nor see the guile herein that lies,"
13646,BOOK II.,"My soul is sad, I deeply mourn,"
13647,BOOK II.,And duty seems a thing to scorn.
13648,BOOK II.,Canst thou one moment think to please
13649,BOOK II.,"This pair who live for love and ease,"
13650,BOOK II.,"And 'gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,"
13651,BOOK II.,With tenderest names their hatred hide?
13652,BOOK II.,Now if thy judgment still refers
13653,BOOK II.,"To Fate this plot of his and hers,"
13654,BOOK II.,My mind herein can ne'er agree:
13655,BOOK II.,"And O, in this be ruled by me."
13656,BOOK II.,"Weak, void of manly pride are they"
13657,BOOK II.,Who bend to Fate's imputed sway:
13658,BOOK II.,"The choicest souls, the nobly great"
13659,BOOK II.,Disdain to bow their heads to Fate.
13660,BOOK II.,And he who dares his Fate control
13661,BOOK II.,"With vigorous act and manly soul,"
13662,BOOK II.,"Though threatening Fate his hopes assail,"
13663,BOOK II.,Unmoved through all need never quail.
13664,BOOK II.,This day mankind shall learn aright
13665,BOOK II.,"The power of Fate and human might,"
13666,BOOK II.,So shall the gulf that lies between
13667,BOOK II.,A man and Fate be clearly seen.
13668,BOOK II.,The might of Fate subdued by me
13669,BOOK II.,"This hour the citizens shall see,"
13670,BOOK II.,Who saw its intervention stay
13671,BOOK II.,Thy consecrating rites to-day.
13672,BOOK II.,"My power shall turn this Fate aside,"
13673,BOOK II.,"That threatens, as, with furious stride,"
13674,BOOK II.,"An elephant who scorns to feel,"
13675,BOOK II.,"In rage unchecked, the driver's steel."
13676,BOOK II.,Not the great Lords whose sleepless might
13677,BOOK II.,"Protects the worlds, shall stay the rite"
13678,BOOK II.,"Though earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:"
13679,BOOK II.,And shall we fear this sire of ours?
13680,BOOK II.,Then if their minds are idly bent
13681,BOOK II.,"To doom thee, King, to banishment,"
13682,BOOK II.,Through twice seven years of exile they
13683,BOOK II.,Shall in the lonely forest stay.
13684,BOOK II.,I will consume the hopes that fire
13685,BOOK II.,"The queen Kaikeyí and our sire,"
13686,BOOK II.,That to her son this check will bring
13687,BOOK II.,"Advantage, making Bharat king."
13688,BOOK II.,The power of Fate will ne'er withstand
13689,BOOK II.,The might that arms my vigorous hand;
13690,BOOK II.,"If danger and distress assail,"
13691,BOOK II.,My fearless strength will still prevail.
13692,BOOK II.,A thousand circling years shall flee:
13693,BOOK II.,"The forest then thy home shall be,"
13694,BOOK II.,"And thy good sons, succeeding, hold"
13695,BOOK II.,The empire which their sire controlled.
13696,BOOK II.,"The royal saints, of old who reigned,"
13697,BOOK II.,For aged kings this rest ordained:
13698,BOOK II.,These to their sons their realm commit
13699,BOOK II.,"That they, like sires, may cherish it."
13700,BOOK II.,"O pious soul, if thou decline"
13701,BOOK II.,"The empire which is justly thine,"
13702,BOOK II.,"Lest, while the king distracted lies,"
13703,BOOK II.,"Disorder in the state should rise,"
13704,BOOK II.,"I,--or no mansion may I find"
13705,BOOK II.,"In worlds to hero souls assigned,--"
13706,BOOK II.,"The guardian of thy realm will be,"
13707,BOOK II.,As the sea-bank protects the sea.
13708,BOOK II.,Then cast thine idle fears aside:
13709,BOOK II.,With prosperous rites be sanctified.
13710,BOOK II.,The lords of earth may strive in vain:
13711,BOOK II.,My power shall all their force restrain.
13712,BOOK II.,"My pair of arms, my warrior's bow"
13713,BOOK II.,Are not for pride or empty show:
13714,BOOK II.,For no support these shafts were made;
13715,BOOK II.,And binding up ill suits my blade:
13716,BOOK II.,To pierce the foe with deadly breach--
13717,BOOK II.,This is the work of all and each.
13718,BOOK II.,"But small, methinks the love I show"
13719,BOOK II.,For him I count my mortal foe.
13720,BOOK II.,"Soon as my trenchant steel is bare,"
13721,BOOK II.,"Flashing its lightning through the air,"
13722,BOOK II.,"I heed no foe, nor stand aghast"
13723,BOOK II.,Though Indra's self the levin cast.
13724,BOOK II.,"Then shall the ways be hard to pass,"
13725,BOOK II.,Where chariots lie in ruinous mass;
13726,BOOK II.,When elephant and man and steed
13727,BOOK II.,"Crushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,"
13728,BOOK II.,"And legs and heads fall, heap on heap,"
13729,BOOK II.,Beneath my sword's tremendous sweep.
13730,BOOK II.,"Struck by my keen brand's trenchant blade,"
13731,BOOK II.,"Thine enemies shall fall dismayed,"
13732,BOOK II.,"Like towering mountains rent in twain,"
13733,BOOK II.,Or lightning clouds that burst in rain.
13734,BOOK II.,"When armed with brace and glove I stand,"
13735,BOOK II.,"And take my trusty bow in hand,"
13736,BOOK II.,Who then shall vaunt his might? who dare
13737,BOOK II.,Count him a man to meet me there?
13738,BOOK II.,"Then will I loose my shafts, and strike"
13739,BOOK II.,"Man, elephant, and steed alike:"
13740,BOOK II.,"At one shall many an arrow fly,"
13741,BOOK II.,And many a foe with one shall die.
13742,BOOK II.,"This day the world my power shall see,"
13743,BOOK II.,That none in arms can rival me:
13744,BOOK II.,"My strength the monarch shall abase,"
13745,BOOK II.,"And set thee, lord, in lordliest place."
13746,BOOK II.,"These arms which breathe the sandal's scent,"
13747,BOOK II.,"Which golden bracelets ornament,"
13748,BOOK II.,"These hands which precious gifts bestow,"
13749,BOOK II.,"Which guard the friend and smite the foe,"
13750,BOOK II.,"A nobler service shall assay,"
13751,BOOK II.,"And fight in Ráma's cause to-day,"
13752,BOOK II.,The robbers of thy rights to stay.
13753,BOOK II.,"Speak, brother, tell thy foeman's name"
13754,BOOK II.,"Whom I, in conquering strife,"
13755,BOOK II.,"May strip of followers and fame,"
13756,BOOK II.,"Of fortune, or of life."
13757,BOOK II.,"Say, how may all this sea-girt land"

14024,BOOK II.,"Ennobled by her spotless fame,"
14025,BOOK II.,With wreaths of flowers and precious scent
14026,BOOK II.,"Worshipped the Gods, most reverent."
14027,BOOK II.,"A high-souled Bráhman lit the fire,"
14028,BOOK II.,"And offered, at the queen's desire,"
14029,BOOK II.,The holy oil ordained to burn
14030,BOOK II.,For Ráma's weal and safe return.
14031,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá best of dames, with care"
14032,BOOK II.,"Set oil, wreaths, fuel, mustard, there."
14033,BOOK II.,"Then when the rites of fire had ceased,"
14034,BOOK II.,"For Ráma's bliss and health, the priest,"
14035,BOOK II.,Standing without gave what remained
14036,BOOK II.,"In general offering,(299) as ordained."
14037,BOOK II.,Dealing among the twice-horn train
14038,BOOK II.,"Honey, and curds, and oil, and grain,"
14039,BOOK II.,He bade each heart and voice unite
14040,BOOK II.,To bless the youthful anchorite.
14041,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma's mother, glorious dame"
14042,BOOK II.,"Bestowed, to meet the Bráhman's claim,"
14043,BOOK II.,A lordly fee for duty done:
14044,BOOK II.,And thus again addressed her son:
14045,BOOK II.,
14046,BOOK II.,"""Such blessings as the Gods o'erjoyed"

14055,BOOK II.,"And Indra slew his Daitya foes,"
14056,BOOK II.,The royal Aditi bestowed
14057,BOOK II.,On Him whose hand with slaughter glowed

14071,BOOK II.,And that prized herb whose sovereign power
14072,BOOK II.,"Preserves from dark misfortune's hour,"
14073,BOOK II.,"Upon the hero's arm she set,"
14074,BOOK II.,To be his faithful amulet.
14075,BOOK II.,"While holy texts she murmured low,"
14076,BOOK II.,"And spoke glad words though crushed by woe,"
14077,BOOK II.,Concealing with obedient tongue
14078,BOOK II.,The pangs with which her heart was wrung.
14079,BOOK II.,"She bent, she kissed his brow, she pressed"
14080,BOOK II.,Her darling to her troubled breast:
14081,BOOK II.,"""Firm in thy purpose, go,"" she cried,"

14091,BOOK II.,These eyes shall fondly gaze on thee
14092,BOOK II.,"So faithful to thy sire's decree,"
14093,BOOK II.,When thou the forest wild shalt quit
14094,BOOK II.,On thine ancestral throne to sit.
14095,BOOK II.,"Yea, thou shalt turn from exile back,"
14096,BOOK II.,"Nor choicest blessings ever lack,"
14097,BOOK II.,Then fill with rapture ever new
14098,BOOK II.,My bosom and thy consort's too.
14099,BOOK II.,To Siva and the heavenly host
14100,BOOK II.,"My worship has been paid,"
14101,BOOK II.,"To mighty saint, to godlike ghost,"
14102,BOOK II.,To every wandering shade.
14103,BOOK II.,"Forth to the forest thou wilt hie,"

14106,BOOK II.,"Protect my child from wrong."""
14107,BOOK II.,Her blessings thus the queen bestowed;
14108,BOOK II.,"Then round him fondly paced,"
14109,BOOK II.,"And often, while her eyes o'erflowed,"
14110,BOOK II.,Her dearest son embraced.
14111,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá's honoured feet he pressed,"

14151,BOOK II.,"His altered cheer, his brow bedewed"

14153,BOOK II.,"And cried, consumed with fires of woe,"
14154,BOOK II.,"""What, O my lord, has changed thee so?"
14155,BOOK II.,"Vrihaspati looks down benign,"
14156,BOOK II.,"And the moon rests in Pushya's sign,"
14157,BOOK II.,As Bráhmans sage this day declare:
14158,BOOK II.,"Then whence, my lord, this grief and care?"
14159,BOOK II.,"Why does no canopy, like foam"
14160,BOOK II.,"For its white beauty, shade thee home,"
14161,BOOK II.,Its hundred ribs spread wide to throw
14162,BOOK II.,Splendour on thy fair head below?

14176,BOOK II.,Where are the myriads should have filled
14177,BOOK II.,"The streets, and followed home their king"

14179,BOOK II.,Why does no gold-wrought chariot lead

14181,BOOK II.,No elephant precede the crowd
14182,BOOK II.,"Like a huge hill or thunder cloud,"

14202,BOOK II.,Of old my father true and brave

14204,BOOK II.,Through these the preparations made
14205,BOOK II.,"For me to-day by her are stayed,"

14208,BOOK II.,In Dandak forest wild and vast
14209,BOOK II.,Must fourteen years by me be passed.

14214,BOOK II.,"In Bharat's presence, O my dame,"
14215,BOOK II.,Ne'er speak with pride of Ráma's name:
14216,BOOK II.,Another's eulogy to hear

14243,BOOK II.,Like brother and like son to thee.
14244,BOOK II.,In every word and deed refrain
14245,BOOK II.,From aught that Bharat's soul may pain:
14246,BOOK II.,"He is Ayodhyá's king and mine,"
14247,BOOK II.,The head and lord of all our line.
14248,BOOK II.,For those who serve and love them much

14280,BOOK II.,"It taints a monarch's son with shame,"

14414,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14415,BOOK II.,On the cold ground upon a heap
14416,BOOK II.,"Of gathered leaves condemned to sleep,"
14417,BOOK II.,"Toil-wearied, will his eyelids close:"
14418,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14419,BOOK II.,Long days and nights must he content
14420,BOOK II.,"His soul with scanty aliment,"
14421,BOOK II.,What fruit the wind from branches blows:
14422,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14423,BOOK II.,"O Sítá, while his strength may last,"
14424,BOOK II.,"The ascetic in the wood must fast,"
14425,BOOK II.,"Coil on his head his matted hair,"
14426,BOOK II.,And bark must be his only wear.
14427,BOOK II.,To Gods and spirits day by day

14433,BOOK II.,Obedient to the law he knows:
14434,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14435,BOOK II.,To grace the altar must be brought
14436,BOOK II.,The gift of flowers his hands have sought--
14437,BOOK II.,The debt each pious hermit owes:
14438,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14439,BOOK II.,The devotee must be content
14440,BOOK II.,"To live, severely abstinent,"
14441,BOOK II.,On what the chance of fortune shows:
14442,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14443,BOOK II.,Hunger afflicts him evermore:
14444,BOOK II.,"The nights are black, the wild winds roar;"
14445,BOOK II.,And there are dangers worse than those:
14446,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14447,BOOK II.,There creeping things in every form
14448,BOOK II.,"Infest the earth, the serpents swarm,"
14449,BOOK II.,And each proud eye with fury glows:
14450,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14451,BOOK II.,The snakes that by the rives hide
14452,BOOK II.,"In sinuous course like rivers glide,"
14453,BOOK II.,And line the path with deadly foes:
14454,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14455,BOOK II.,"Scorpions, and grasshoppers, and flies"
14456,BOOK II.,"Disturb the wanderer as he lies,"

14458,BOOK II.,"The wood, my love, is full of woes."
14459,BOOK II.,"Trees, thorny bushes, intertwined,"
14460,BOOK II.,"Their branched ends together bind,"
14461,BOOK II.,And dense with grass the thicket grows:
14462,BOOK II.,"The wood, my dear, is full of woes,"
14463,BOOK II.,"With many ills the flesh is tried,"
14464,BOOK II.,When these and countless fears beside
14465,BOOK II.,Vex those who in the wood remain:
14466,BOOK II.,The wilds are naught but grief and pain.
14467,BOOK II.,"Hope, anger must be cast aside,"
14468,BOOK II.,To penance every thought applied:
14469,BOOK II.,No fear must be of things to fear:
14470,BOOK II.,Hence is the wood for ever drear.
14471,BOOK II.,"Enough, my love: thy purpose quit:"

14483,BOOK II.,"The lady heard with deep distress,"

14486,BOOK II.,"""The perils of the wood, and all"
14487,BOOK II.,"The woes thou countest to appal,"
14488,BOOK II.,Led by my love I deem not pain;
14489,BOOK II.,"Each woe a charm, each loss a gain."
14490,BOOK II.,"Tiger, and elephant, and deer,"
14491,BOOK II.,"Bull, lion, buffalo, in fear,"
14492,BOOK II.,"Soon as thy matchless form they see,"

14494,BOOK II.,"With thee, O Ráma, I must go:"
14495,BOOK II.,My sire's command ordains it so.
14496,BOOK II.,"Bereft of thee, my lonely heart"
14497,BOOK II.,"Must break, and life and I must part."

14501,BOOK II.,With all his might can do me wrong.
14502,BOOK II.,Nor can a lonely woman left
14503,BOOK II.,By her dear husband live bereft.
14504,BOOK II.,"In my great love, my lord, I ween,"
14505,BOOK II.,The truth of this thou mayst have seen.
14506,BOOK II.,In my sire's palace long ago
14507,BOOK II.,"I heard the chief of those who know,"
14508,BOOK II.,"The truth-declaring Bráhmans, tell"
14509,BOOK II.,"My fortune, in the wood to dwell."
14510,BOOK II.,I heard their promise who divine
14511,BOOK II.,"The future by each mark and sign,"
14512,BOOK II.,And from that hour have longed to lead
14513,BOOK II.,The forest life their lips decreed.
14514,BOOK II.,"Now, mighty Ráma, I must share"
14515,BOOK II.,Thy father's doom which sends thee there;
14516,BOOK II.,"In this I will not be denied,"
14517,BOOK II.,"But follow, love, where thou shalt guide."
14518,BOOK II.,"O husband, I will go with thee,"
14519,BOOK II.,Obedient to that high decree.
14520,BOOK II.,"Now let the Bráhmans' words be true,"
14521,BOOK II.,For this the time they had in view.
14522,BOOK II.,I know full well the wood has woes;
14523,BOOK II.,But they disturb the lives of those
14524,BOOK II.,"Who in the forest dwell, nor hold"
14525,BOOK II.,Their rebel senses well controlled.
14526,BOOK II.,"In my sire's halls, ere I was wed,"
14527,BOOK II.,I heard a dame who begged her bread
14528,BOOK II.,Before my mother's face relate
14529,BOOK II.,What griefs a forest life await.
14530,BOOK II.,And many a time in sport I prayed
14531,BOOK II.,"To seek with thee the greenwood shade,"
14532,BOOK II.,"For O, my heart on this is set,"
14533,BOOK II.,"To follow thee, dear anchoret."
14534,BOOK II.,May blessings on thy life attend:
14535,BOOK II.,"I long with thee my steps to bend,"
14536,BOOK II.,For with such hero as thou art
14537,BOOK II.,This pilgrimage enchants my heart.
14538,BOOK II.,"Still close, my lord, to thy dear side"
14539,BOOK II.,My spirit will be purified:
14540,BOOK II.,Love from all sin my soul will free:
14541,BOOK II.,My husband is a God to me.
14542,BOOK II.,"So, love, with thee shall I have bliss"
14543,BOOK II.,And share the life that follows this.

14554,BOOK II.,"Nor take me with thee to the wood,"
14555,BOOK II.,Thine own dear wife so true and good.
14556,BOOK II.,But if thou wilt not take me there
14557,BOOK II.,"Thus grieving in my wild despair,"
14558,BOOK II.,"To fire or water I will fly,"

14560,BOOK II.,
14561,BOOK II.,"So thus to share his exile, she"

14580,BOOK II.,And with her spirit sorely tried
14581,BOOK II.,"By fear and anger, love and pride,"

14592,BOOK II.,Why sinkest thou in such dismay?
14593,BOOK II.,"What fears upon thy spirit weigh,"

14595,BOOK II.,From her who thinks of naught but thee?
14596,BOOK II.,To thy dear will am I resigned
14597,BOOK II.,"In heart and body, soul and mind,"
14598,BOOK II.,"As Sávitrí gave all to one,"

14827,BOOK II.,Follow this counsel and protect
14828,BOOK II.,My honoured mother from neglect.
14829,BOOK II.,"So thou, while not to me alone"
14830,BOOK II.,"Thy great affection will be shown,"
14831,BOOK II.,To highest duty wilt adhere

14837,BOOK II.,
14838,BOOK II.,"The faithful Lakshman, thus addressed"
14839,BOOK II.,"In gentle words which love expressed,"
14840,BOOK II.,"To him in lore of language learned,"
14841,BOOK II.,"His answer, eloquent, returned:"
14842,BOOK II.,
14843,BOOK II.,"""Nay, through thy might each queen will share"
14844,BOOK II.,"Attentive Bharat's love and care,"
14845,BOOK II.,"Should Bharat, raised as king to sway"
14846,BOOK II.,"This noblest realm, his trust betray,"

14851,BOOK II.,"Kill him and all who lend him aid,"
14852,BOOK II.,And the three worlds in league arrayed.
14853,BOOK II.,And good Kausalyá well can fee
14854,BOOK II.,A thousand champions like to me.
14855,BOOK II.,A thousand hamlets rich in grain
14856,BOOK II.,The station of that queen maintain.
14857,BOOK II.,"She may, and my dear mother too,"
14858,BOOK II.,Live on the ample revenue.
14859,BOOK II.,Then let me follow thee: herein:
14860,BOOK II.,Is naught that may resemble sin.
14861,BOOK II.,"So shall I in my wish succeed,"
14862,BOOK II.,"And aid, perhaps, my brother's need."
14863,BOOK II.,My bow and quiver well supplied
14864,BOOK II.,"With arrows hanging at my side,"
14865,BOOK II.,"My hands shall spade and basket bear,"
14866,BOOK II.,And for thy feet the way prepare.
14867,BOOK II.,I'll bring thee roots and berries sweet.
14868,BOOK II.,And woodland fare which hermits eat.
14869,BOOK II.,Thou shall with thy Videhan spouse
14870,BOOK II.,Recline upon the mountain's brows;
14871,BOOK II.,"Be mine the toil, be mine to keep"
14872,BOOK II.,"Watch o'er thee waking or asleep."""
14873,BOOK II.,
14874,BOOK II.,"Filled by his speech with joy and pride,"
14875,BOOK II.,Ráma to Lakshman thus replied:
14876,BOOK II.,"""Go then, my brother, bid adieu"
14877,BOOK II.,To all thy friends and retinue.
14878,BOOK II.,"And those two bows of fearful might,"
14879,BOOK II.,"Celestial, which, at that famed rite,"
14880,BOOK II.,"Lord Varun gave to Janak, king"

14888,BOOK II.,"With speed, O Lakshman, go, produce,"
14889,BOOK II.,"And bring them hither for our use."""
14890,BOOK II.,"So on a woodland life intent,"
14891,BOOK II.,"To see his faithful friends he went,"
14892,BOOK II.,And brought the heavenly arms which lay
14893,BOOK II.,By Ráma's teacher stored away.
14894,BOOK II.,And Raghu's son to Ráma showed
14895,BOOK II.,"Those wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,"
14896,BOOK II.,"Well kept, adorned with many a wreath"
14897,BOOK II.,"Of flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath."
14898,BOOK II.,The prudent Ráma at the sight
14899,BOOK II.,Addressed his brother with delight:
14900,BOOK II.,"""Well art thou come, my brother dear,"
14901,BOOK II.,For much I longed to see thee here.
14902,BOOK II.,"For with thine aid, before I go,"
14903,BOOK II.,I would my gold and wealth bestow
14904,BOOK II.,"Upon the Bráhmans sage, who school"
14905,BOOK II.,Their lives by stern devotion's rule.
14906,BOOK II.,And for all those who ever dwell

14926,BOOK II.,"His friendly wish, the chief obeyed,"
14927,BOOK II.,With steps made swift by anxious thought
14928,BOOK II.,The wise Suyajna's home he sought.
14929,BOOK II.,"Him in the hall of Fire(307) he found,"
14930,BOOK II.,And bent before him to the ground:
14931,BOOK II.,"""O friend, to Ráma's house return,"
14932,BOOK II.,"Who now performs a task most stern."""
14933,BOOK II.,"He, when his noonday rites were done,"
14934,BOOK II.,"Went forth with fair Sumitrá's son,"
14935,BOOK II.,And came to Ráma's bright abode
14936,BOOK II.,Rich in the love which Lakshmí showed.
14937,BOOK II.,"The son of Raghu, with his dame,"
14938,BOOK II.,"With joined hands met him as he came,"
14939,BOOK II.,Showing to him who Scripture knew
14940,BOOK II.,The worship that is Agni's due.
14941,BOOK II.,"With armlets, bracelets, collars, rings,"
14942,BOOK II.,"With costly pearls on golden strings,"
14943,BOOK II.,With many a gem for neck and limb
14944,BOOK II.,The son of Raghu honoured him.
14945,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, at his wife's request,"
14946,BOOK II.,The wise Suyajna thus addressed:
14947,BOOK II.,"""Accept a necklace too to deck"
14948,BOOK II.,With golden strings thy spouse's neck.
14949,BOOK II.,"And Sítá here, my friend, were glad"

14961,BOOK II.,"And let a thousand coins of gold,"
14962,BOOK II.,"Great Bráhman, with the gift be told."""
14963,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma spoke: nor he declined
14964,BOOK II.,The noble gifts for him designed.
14965,BOOK II.,"On Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá he"
14966,BOOK II.,Invoked all high felicity.
14967,BOOK II.,
14968,BOOK II.,In pleasant words then Ráma gave
14969,BOOK II.,"His best to Lakshman prompt and brave,"
14970,BOOK II.,As Brahmá speaks for Him to hear
14971,BOOK II.,Who rules the Gods' celestial sphere:
14972,BOOK II.,"""To the two best of Bráhmans run;"
14973,BOOK II.,"Agastya bring, and Kusik's son,"
14974,BOOK II.,"And precious gifts upon them rain,"

14976,BOOK II.,"O long-armed Prince of Raghu's line,"
14977,BOOK II.,"Delight them with a thousand kine,"
14978,BOOK II.,"And many a fair and costly gem,"

14984,BOOK II.,"To him, with women-slaves, present"

14995,BOOK II.,"Nor think of other exercise,"
14996,BOOK II.,"Who toil not, loving dainty fare,"
14997,BOOK II.,Whose praises e'en the good declare--
14998,BOOK II.,"On these be eighty cars bestowed,"
14999,BOOK II.,And each with precious treasures load.
15000,BOOK II.,"A thousand bulls for them suffice,"
15001,BOOK II.,"Two hundred elephants of price,"
15002,BOOK II.,And let a thousand kine beside
15003,BOOK II.,The dainties of each meal provide.
15004,BOOK II.,"The throng who sacred girdles wear,"
15005,BOOK II.,And on Kausalyá wait with care--

15007,BOOK II.,"Son of Sumitrá, each of these."
15008,BOOK II.,"Let all, dear Lakshman of the train"

15011,BOOK II.,"Her Bráhmans have been cherished so."""
15012,BOOK II.,
15013,BOOK II.,Then Raghu's son addressed the crowd
15014,BOOK II.,"Who round him stood and wept aloud,"
15015,BOOK II.,When he to all who thronged the court
15016,BOOK II.,Had dealt his wealth for their support:
15017,BOOK II.,"""In Lakshman's house and mine remain,"
15018,BOOK II.,"And guard them till I come again."""
15019,BOOK II.,"To all his people sad with grief,"
15020,BOOK II.,"In loving words thus spoke their chief,"
15021,BOOK II.,Then bade his treasure-keeper bring
15022,BOOK II.,"Gold, silver, and each precious thing."
15023,BOOK II.,Then straight the servants went and bore
15024,BOOK II.,Back to their chief the wealth in store.
15025,BOOK II.,"Before the people's eyes it shone,"
15026,BOOK II.,A glorious pile to look upon.
15027,BOOK II.,The prince of men with Lakshman's aid
15028,BOOK II.,"Parted the treasures there displayed,"
15029,BOOK II.,"Gave to the poor, the young, the old,"
15030,BOOK II.,"And twice-born men, the gems and gold."
15031,BOOK II.,
15032,BOOK II.,"A Bráhman, long in evil case,"
15033,BOOK II.,"Named Trijat, born of Garga's race,"
15034,BOOK II.,Earned ever toiling in a wood
15035,BOOK II.,With spade and plough his livelihood.
15036,BOOK II.,"The youthful wife, his babes who bore,"
15037,BOOK II.,Their indigence felt more and more.
15038,BOOK II.,Thus to the aged man she spake:
15039,BOOK II.,"""Hear this my word: my counsel take."
15040,BOOK II.,"Come, throw thy spade and plough away;"
15041,BOOK II.,"To virtuous Ráma go to-day,"
15042,BOOK II.,"And somewhat of his kindness pray."""
15043,BOOK II.,
15044,BOOK II.,He heard the words she spoke: around
15045,BOOK II.,"His limbs his ragged cloth he wound,"
15046,BOOK II.,And took his journey by the road
15047,BOOK II.,That led to Ráma's fair abode.
15048,BOOK II.,To the fifth court he made his way;
15049,BOOK II.,Nor met the Bráhman check or stay.
15050,BOOK II.,"Brighu, Angiras(309) could not be"
15051,BOOK II.,Brighter with saintly light than he.
15052,BOOK II.,"To Ráma's presence on he pressed,"
15053,BOOK II.,And thus the noble chief addressed:
15054,BOOK II.,"""O Ráma, poor and weak am I,"
15055,BOOK II.,And many children round me cry.
15056,BOOK II.,Scant living in the woods I earn:
15057,BOOK II.,"On me thine eye of pity turn."""
15058,BOOK II.,"And Ráma, bent on sport and jest,"
15059,BOOK II.,The suppliant Bráhman thus addressed:
15060,BOOK II.,"""O aged man, one thousand kine,"
15061,BOOK II.,"Yet undistributed, are mine."
15062,BOOK II.,The cows on thee will I bestow
15063,BOOK II.,"As far as thou thy staff canst throw."""
15064,BOOK II.,
15065,BOOK II.,The Bráhman heard. In eager haste
15066,BOOK II.,He bound his cloth around his waist.
15067,BOOK II.,"Then round his head his staff he whirled,"
15068,BOOK II.,And forth with mightiest effort hurled.
15069,BOOK II.,"Cast from his hand it flew, and sank"
15070,BOOK II.,"To earth on Sarjú's farther bank,"
15071,BOOK II.,Where herds of kine in thousands fed
15072,BOOK II.,Near to the well-stocked bullock shed.
15073,BOOK II.,And all the cows that wandered o'er
15074,BOOK II.,"The meadow, far as Sarjú's shore,"
15075,BOOK II.,At Ráma's word the herdsmen drove
15076,BOOK II.,To Trijat's cottage in the grove.
15077,BOOK II.,"He drew the Bráhman to his breast,"
15078,BOOK II.,And thus with calming words addressed:
15079,BOOK II.,"""Now be not angry, Sire. I pray:"
15080,BOOK II.,This jest of mine was meant in play.
15081,BOOK II.,"These thousand kine, but not alone."
15082,BOOK II.,"Their herdsmen too, are all thine own."
15083,BOOK II.,"And wealth beside I give thee: speak,"
15084,BOOK II.,"Thine shall be all thy heart can seek."""
15085,BOOK II.,
15086,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma spake. And Trijat prayed
15087,BOOK II.,For means his sacrifice to aid.
15088,BOOK II.,"And Ráma gave much wealth, required"
15089,BOOK II.,To speed his offering as desired.

15095,BOOK II.,
15096,BOOK II.,
15097,BOOK II.,Thus Sítá and the princes brave
15098,BOOK II.,Much wealth to all the Bráhmans gave.
15099,BOOK II.,Then to the monarch's house the three
15100,BOOK II.,Went forth the aged king to see.
15101,BOOK II.,The princes from two servants took
15102,BOOK II.,"Those heavenly arms of glorious look,"
15103,BOOK II.,Adorned with garland and with band
15104,BOOK II.,By Sítá's beautifying hand.
15105,BOOK II.,On each high house a mournful throng
15106,BOOK II.,"Had gathered ere they passed along,"
15107,BOOK II.,Who gazed in pure unselfish woe
15108,BOOK II.,"From turret, roof, and portico."
15109,BOOK II.,"So dense the crowd that blocked the ways,"
15110,BOOK II.,"The rest, unable there to gaze,"
15111,BOOK II.,"Were fain each terrace to ascend,"
15112,BOOK II.,And thence their eyes on Ráma bend.
15113,BOOK II.,Then as the gathered multitude
15114,BOOK II.,"On foot their well-loved Ráma viewed,"
15115,BOOK II.,"No royal shade to screen his head,"
15116,BOOK II.,"Such words, disturbed in grief, they said:"
15117,BOOK II.,"""O look, our hero, wont to ride"
15118,BOOK II.,Leading a host in perfect pride--
15119,BOOK II.,"Now Lakshman, sole of all his friends,"
15120,BOOK II.,With Sítá on his steps attends.
15121,BOOK II.,"Though he has known the sweets of power,"
15122,BOOK II.,"And poured his gifts in liberal shower,"
15123,BOOK II.,"From duty's path he will not swerve,"
15124,BOOK II.,"But, still his father's truth preserve."
15125,BOOK II.,And she whose form so soft and fair
15126,BOOK II.,"Was veiled from spirits of the air,"
15127,BOOK II.,"Now walks unsheltered from the day,"
15128,BOOK II.,Seen by the crowds who throng the way.
15129,BOOK II.,"Ah, for that gently-nurtured form!"
15130,BOOK II.,How will it fade with sun and storm!
15131,BOOK II.,"How will the rain, the cold, the heat"
15132,BOOK II.,Mar fragrant breast and tinted feet!
15133,BOOK II.,Surely some demon has possessed
15134,BOOK II.,"His sire, and speaks within his breast,"
15135,BOOK II.,Or how could one that is a king
15136,BOOK II.,Thus send his dear son wandering?
15137,BOOK II.,It were a deed unkindly done
15138,BOOK II.,To banish e'en a worthless son:
15139,BOOK II.,"But what, when his pure life has gained"
15140,BOOK II.,"The hearts of all, by love enchained?"
15141,BOOK II.,Six sovereign virtues join to grace
15142,BOOK II.,Ráma the foremost of his race:
15143,BOOK II.,"Tender and kind and pure is he,"
15144,BOOK II.,"Docile, religious, passion-free."
15145,BOOK II.,Hence misery strikes not him alone:
15146,BOOK II.,"In bitterest grief the people moan,"
15147,BOOK II.,"Like creatures of the stream, when dry"
15148,BOOK II.,In the great heat the channels lie.
15149,BOOK II.,The world is mournful with the grief
15150,BOOK II.,"That falls on its beloved chief,"
15151,BOOK II.,"As, when the root is hewn away,"
15152,BOOK II.,"Tree, fruit, and flower, and bud decay."
15153,BOOK II.,"The soul of duty, bright to see,"
15154,BOOK II.,He is the root of you and me;
15155,BOOK II.,"And all of us, who share his grief,"
15156,BOOK II.,"His branches, blossom, fruit, and leaf."
15157,BOOK II.,"Now like the faithful Lakshman, we"
15158,BOOK II.,Will follow and be true as he;
15159,BOOK II.,"Our wives and kinsmen call with speed,"
15160,BOOK II.,And hasten where our lord shall lead.
15161,BOOK II.,"Yes, we will leave each well-loved spot,"
15162,BOOK II.,"The field, the garden, and the cot,"
15163,BOOK II.,"And, sharers of his weal and woe,"
15164,BOOK II.,Behind the pious Ráma go.
15165,BOOK II.,"Our houses, empty of their stores,"
15166,BOOK II.,"With ruined courts and broken doors,"
15167,BOOK II.,With all their treasures borne away.
15168,BOOK II.,And gear that made them bright and gay:
15169,BOOK II.,"O'errun by rats, with dust o'erspread,"
15170,BOOK II.,"Shrines, whence the deities have fled,"
15171,BOOK II.,"Where not a hand the water pours,"
15172,BOOK II.,"Or sweeps the long-neglected floors,"
15173,BOOK II.,"No incense loads the evening air,"
15174,BOOK II.,"No Bráhmans chant the text and prayer,"
15175,BOOK II.,"No fire of sacrifice is bright,"
15176,BOOK II.,"No gift is known, no sacred rite;"
15177,BOOK II.,"With floors which broken vessels strew,"
15178,BOOK II.,As if our woes had crushed them too--
15179,BOOK II.,"Of these be stern Kaikeyí queen,"
15180,BOOK II.,And rule o'er homes where we have been.
15181,BOOK II.,The wood where Ráma's feet may roam
15182,BOOK II.,"Shall be our city and our home,"
15183,BOOK II.,"And this fair city we forsake,"
15184,BOOK II.,Our flight a wilderness shall make.
15185,BOOK II.,"Each serpent from his hole shall hie,"
15186,BOOK II.,"The birds and beasts from mountain fly,"
15187,BOOK II.,Lions and elephants in fear
15188,BOOK II.,"Shall quit the woods when we come near,"
15189,BOOK II.,"Yield the broad wilds for us to range,"
15190,BOOK II.,And take our city in exchange.
15191,BOOK II.,"With Ráma will we hence, content"
15192,BOOK II.,"If, where he is, our days be spent."""
15193,BOOK II.,
15194,BOOK II.,Such were the varied words the crowd
15195,BOOK II.,Of all conditions spoke aloud.
15196,BOOK II.,"And Ráma heard their speeches, yet"
15197,BOOK II.,Changed not his purpose firmly set.
15198,BOOK II.,"His father's palace soon he neared,"
15199,BOOK II.,That like Kailása's hill appeared.
15200,BOOK II.,Like a wild elephant he strode
15201,BOOK II.,Right onward to the bright abode.
15202,BOOK II.,"Within the palace court he stepped,"
15203,BOOK II.,"Where ordered bands their station kept,"

15226,BOOK II.,A while the wise Sumantra gazed
15227,BOOK II.,"On him whose senses woe has dazed,"
15228,BOOK II.,Grieving for Ráma. Near he drew
15229,BOOK II.,With hands upraised in reverence due.
15230,BOOK II.,With blessing first his king he hailed;
15231,BOOK II.,"Then with a voice that well-nigh failed,"
15232,BOOK II.,In trembling accents soft and low
15233,BOOK II.,Addressed the monarch in his woe:
15234,BOOK II.,"""The prince of men, thy Ráma, waits"
15235,BOOK II.,Before thee at the palace gates.
15236,BOOK II.,"His wealth to Bráhmans he has dealt,"
15237,BOOK II.,And all who in his home have dwelt.
15238,BOOK II.,Admit thy son. His friends have heard
15239,BOOK II.,"His kind farewell and parting word,"
15240,BOOK II.,"He longs to see thee first, and then"
15241,BOOK II.,"Will seek the wilds, O King of men."
15242,BOOK II.,"He, with each princely virtue's blaze,"
15243,BOOK II.,"Shines as the sun engirt by rays."""
15244,BOOK II.,
15245,BOOK II.,The truthful King who loved to keep
15246,BOOK II.,"The law profound as Ocean's deep,"
15247,BOOK II.,"And stainless as the dark blue sky,"
15248,BOOK II.,Thus to Sumantra made reply:
15249,BOOK II.,"""Go then, Sumantra, go and call"
15250,BOOK II.,My wives and ladies one and all.
15251,BOOK II.,Drawn round me shall they fill the place
15252,BOOK II.,"When I behold my Ráma's face."""
15253,BOOK II.,
15254,BOOK II.,"Quick to the inner rooms he sped,"
15255,BOOK II.,"And thus to all the women said,"
15256,BOOK II.,"""Come, at the summons of the king:"
15257,BOOK II.,"Come all, and make no tarrying."""
15258,BOOK II.,
15259,BOOK II.,"Their husband's word, by him conveyed,"
15260,BOOK II.,"Soon as they heard, the dames obeyed,"
15261,BOOK II.,And following his guidance all
15262,BOOK II.,Came thronging to the regal hall.
15263,BOOK II.,"In number half seven hundred, they,"
15264,BOOK II.,"All lovely dames, in long array,"
15265,BOOK II.,"With their bright eyes for weeping red,"
15266,BOOK II.,"To stand round Queen Kausalyá, sped."
15267,BOOK II.,"They gathered, and the monarch viewed"
15268,BOOK II.,"One moment all the multitude,"
15269,BOOK II.,Then to Sumantra spoke and said:
15270,BOOK II.,"""Now let my son be hither led."""
15271,BOOK II.,
15272,BOOK II.,"Sumantra went. Then Ráma came,"
15273,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman, and the Maithil dame,"
15274,BOOK II.,"And, as he led them on, their guide"
15275,BOOK II.,Straight to the monarch's presence hied.
15276,BOOK II.,When yet far off the father saw
15277,BOOK II.,"His son with raised palms toward him draw,"
15278,BOOK II.,"Girt by his ladies, sick with woes,"
15279,BOOK II.,Swift from his royal seat he rose.
15280,BOOK II.,With all his strength the aged man
15281,BOOK II.,"To meet his darling Ráma ran,"
15282,BOOK II.,"But trembling, wild with dark despair,"
15283,BOOK II.,Fell on the ground and fainted there.
15284,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman, wont in cars to ride,"
15285,BOOK II.,"And Ráma, threw them by the side"
15286,BOOK II.,"Of the poor miserable king,"
15287,BOOK II.,Half lifeless with his sorrow's sting.
15288,BOOK II.,Throughout the spacious hall up went
15289,BOOK II.,A thousand women's wild lament:
15290,BOOK II.,"""Ah Ráma!"" thus they wailed and wept,"
15291,BOOK II.,And anklets tinkled as they stepped
15292,BOOK II.,"Around his body, weeping, threw"
15293,BOOK II.,"Their loving arms the brothers two,"
15294,BOOK II.,"And then, with Sítá's gentle aid,"
15295,BOOK II.,The king upon a couch was laid.
15296,BOOK II.,"At length to earth's imperial lord,"
15297,BOOK II.,"When life and knowledge were restored,"
15298,BOOK II.,"Though seas of woe went o'er his head,"
15299,BOOK II.,"With suppliant hand, thus Ráma said:"
15300,BOOK II.,"""Lord of us all, great King, thou art:"
15301,BOOK II.,"Bid me farewell before we part,"
15302,BOOK II.,To Dandak wood this day I go:
15303,BOOK II.,One blessing and one look bestow.
15304,BOOK II.,"Let Lakshman my companion be,"
15305,BOOK II.,And Sítá also follow me.
15306,BOOK II.,With truthful pleas I sought to bend
15307,BOOK II.,Their purpose; but no ear they lend.
15308,BOOK II.,"Now cast this sorrow from thy heart,"
15309,BOOK II.,"And let us all, great King, depart."
15310,BOOK II.,"As Brahmá sends his children, so"
15311,BOOK II.,"Let Lakshman, me, and Sítá go."""
15312,BOOK II.,
15313,BOOK II.,"He stood unmoved, and watched intent"
15314,BOOK II.,Until the king should grant consent.
15315,BOOK II.,"Upon his son his eyes he cast,"
15316,BOOK II.,And thus the monarch spake at last:
15317,BOOK II.,"""O Ráma, by her arts enslaved,"
15318,BOOK II.,"I gave the boons Kaikeyí craved,"
15319,BOOK II.,"Unfit to reign, by her misled:"
15320,BOOK II.,"Be ruler in thy father's stead."""
15321,BOOK II.,
15322,BOOK II.,"Thus by the lord of men addressed,"
15323,BOOK II.,"Ráma, of virtue's friends the best,"
15324,BOOK II.,"In lore of language duly learned,"
15325,BOOK II.,"His answer, reverent, thus returned:"
15326,BOOK II.,"""A thousand years, O King, remain"
15327,BOOK II.,O'er this our city still to reign.
15328,BOOK II.,I in the woods my life will lead:
15329,BOOK II.,The lust of rule no more I heed.
15330,BOOK II.,"Nine years and five I there will spend,"
15331,BOOK II.,"And when the portioned days shall end,"
15332,BOOK II.,"Will come, my vows and exile o'er,"
15333,BOOK II.,"And clasp thy feet, my King, once more."""
15334,BOOK II.,
15335,BOOK II.,"A captive in the snare of truth,"
15336,BOOK II.,"Weeping, distressed with woe and ruth,"
15337,BOOK II.,"Thus spake the monarch, while the queen"
15338,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí urged him on unseen:
15339,BOOK II.,"""Go then, O Ráma, and begin"
15340,BOOK II.,Thy course unvext by fear and sin:
15341,BOOK II.,"Go, my beloved son, and earn"
15342,BOOK II.,"Success, and joy, and safe return."
15343,BOOK II.,So fast the bonds of duty bind.
15344,BOOK II.,"O Raghu's son, thy truthful mind,"
15345,BOOK II.,"That naught can turn thee back, or guide"
15346,BOOK II.,Thy will so strongly fortified.
15347,BOOK II.,"But O, a little longer stay,"
15348,BOOK II.,"Nor turn thy steps this night away,"
15349,BOOK II.,That I one little day---alas!
15350,BOOK II.,One only---with my son may pass.
15351,BOOK II.,"Me and thy mother do not slight,"
15352,BOOK II.,"But stay, my son, with me to-night;"
15353,BOOK II.,"With every dainty please thy taste,"
15354,BOOK II.,And seek to-morrow morn the waste.
15355,BOOK II.,"Hard is thy task, O Raghu's son,"
15356,BOOK II.,"Dire is the toil thou wilt not shun,"
15357,BOOK II.,"Far to the lonely wood to flee,"
15358,BOOK II.,And leave thy friends for love of me.
15359,BOOK II.,"I swear it by my truth, believe,"
15360,BOOK II.,"For thee, my son, I deeply grieve,"
15361,BOOK II.,Misguided by the traitress dame
15362,BOOK II.,With hidden guile like smouldering flame.
15363,BOOK II.,"Now, by her wicked counsel stirred,"
15364,BOOK II.,Thou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.
15365,BOOK II.,No marvel that my eldest born
15366,BOOK II.,"Would hold me true when I have sworn."""
15367,BOOK II.,
15368,BOOK II.,Then Ráma having calmly heard
15369,BOOK II.,"His wretched father speak each word,"
15370,BOOK II.,With Lakshman standing by his side
15371,BOOK II.,"Thus, humbly, to the King replied:"
15372,BOOK II.,"""If dainties now my taste regale,"
15373,BOOK II.,To-morrow must those dainties fail.
15374,BOOK II.,This day departure I prefer
15375,BOOK II.,To all that wealth can minister.
15376,BOOK II.,"O'er this fair land, no longer mine,"
15377,BOOK II.,"Which I, with all her realms, resign,"
15378,BOOK II.,"Her multitudes of men, her grain,"
15379,BOOK II.,"Her stores of wealth, let Bharat reign."
15380,BOOK II.,And let the promised boon which thou
15381,BOOK II.,"Wast pleased to grant the queen ere now,"
15382,BOOK II.,"Be hers in full. Be true, O King,"
15383,BOOK II.,Kind giver of each precious thing.
15384,BOOK II.,"Thy spoken word I still will heed,"
15385,BOOK II.,Obeying all thy lips decreed:
15386,BOOK II.,And fourteen years in woods will dwell
15387,BOOK II.,With those who live in glade and dell.
15388,BOOK II.,"No hopes of power my heart can touch,"
15389,BOOK II.,No selfish joys attract so much
15390,BOOK II.,"As son of Raghu, to fulfil"
15391,BOOK II.,With heart and soul my father's will.
15392,BOOK II.,"Dismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,"
15393,BOOK II.,Nor let those drowning torrents flow:
15394,BOOK II.,The Lord of Rivers in his pride
15395,BOOK II.,Keeps to the banks that bar his tide.
15396,BOOK II.,Here in thy presence I declare;
15397,BOOK II.,"By thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;"
15398,BOOK II.,"Nor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;"
15399,BOOK II.,"Life, heaven, all blessings I despise."
15400,BOOK II.,I wish to see thee still remain
15401,BOOK II.,"Most true, O King, and free from stain."
15402,BOOK II.,"It must not, Sire, it must not be:"
15403,BOOK II.,I cannot rest one hour with thee.
15404,BOOK II.,"Then bring this sorrow to an end,"
15405,BOOK II.,For naught my settled will can bend.
15406,BOOK II.,"I gave a pledge that binds me too,"
15407,BOOK II.,And to that pledge I still am true.
15408,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí bade me speed away:
15409,BOOK II.,"She prayed me, and I answered yea."
15410,BOOK II.,"Pine not for me, and weep no more;"
15411,BOOK II.,"The wood for us has joy in store,"

16034,BOOK II.,"From father, brother, and from son"
16035,BOOK II.,A measured share of joy is won:
16036,BOOK II.,"Who would not honour, love, and bless"
16037,BOOK II.,"Her lord, whose gifts are measureless?"
16038,BOOK II.,"Thus trained to think, I hold in awe"
16039,BOOK II.,Scripture's command and duty's law.
16040,BOOK II.,Him can I hold in slight esteem?
16041,BOOK II.,"Her lord is woman's God, I deem."""
16042,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá heard the lady's speech,"
16043,BOOK II.,Nor failed those words her heart to reach.
16044,BOOK II.,"Then, pure in mind, she gave to flow"
16045,BOOK II.,The tear that sprang of joy and woe.
16046,BOOK II.,Then duteous Ráma forward came
16047,BOOK II.,"And stood before the honoured dame,"
16048,BOOK II.,And joining reverent hands addressed
16049,BOOK II.,The queen in rank above the rest:
16050,BOOK II.,"""O mother, from these tears refrain;"
16051,BOOK II.,Look on my sire and still thy pain.
16052,BOOK II.,To thee my days afar shall fly
16053,BOOK II.,"As if sweet slumber closed thine eye,"
16054,BOOK II.,And fourteen years of exile seem
16055,BOOK II.,"To thee, dear mother, like a dream."
16056,BOOK II.,"On me returning safe and well,"
16057,BOOK II.,"Girt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell."""
16058,BOOK II.,
16059,BOOK II.,Thus for their deep affection's sake
16060,BOOK II.,"The hero to his mother spake,"
16061,BOOK II.,"Then to the half seven hundred too,"
16062,BOOK II.,"Wives of his sire, paid reverence due."
16063,BOOK II.,Thus Dasaratha's son addressed
16064,BOOK II.,That crowd of matrons sore distressed:
16065,BOOK II.,"""If from these lips, while here I dwelt,"
16066,BOOK II.,"One heedless taunt you e'er have felt,"
16067,BOOK II.,"Forgive me, pray. And now adieu,"
16068,BOOK II.,"I bid good-bye to all of you."""
16069,BOOK II.,"Then straight, like curlews' cries, upwent"
16070,BOOK II.,"The voices of their wild lament,"
16071,BOOK II.,"While, as he bade farewell, the crowd"
16072,BOOK II.,"Of royal women wept aloud,"
16073,BOOK II.,And through the ample hall's extent.
16074,BOOK II.,"Where erst the sound of tabour, blent"
16075,BOOK II.,"With drum and shrill-toned instrument,"
16076,BOOK II.,"In joyous concert rose,"
16077,BOOK II.,"Now rang the sound of wailing high,"
16078,BOOK II.,"The lamentation and the cry,"
16079,BOOK II.,"The shriek, the choking sob, the sigh"
16080,BOOK II.,That told the ladies' woes.

16086,BOOK II.,
16087,BOOK II.,
16088,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman bent"
16089,BOOK II.,"At the king's feet, and sadly went"
16090,BOOK II.,Round him with slow steps reverent.
16091,BOOK II.,When Ráma of the duteous heart
16092,BOOK II.,"Had gained his sire's consent to part,"
16093,BOOK II.,With Sítá by his side he paid
16094,BOOK II.,Due reverence to the queen dismayed.
16095,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman, with affection meet,"
16096,BOOK II.,Bowed down and clasped his mother's feet.
16097,BOOK II.,Sumitrá viewed him as he pressed
16098,BOOK II.,"Her feet, and thus her son addressed:"
16099,BOOK II.,"""Neglect not Ráma wandering there,"
16100,BOOK II.,But tend him with thy faithful care.
16101,BOOK II.,"In hours of wealth, in time of woe,"
16102,BOOK II.,"Him, sinless son, thy refuge know."
16103,BOOK II.,"From this good law the just ne'er swerve,"
16104,BOOK II.,"That younger sons the eldest serve,"
16105,BOOK II.,And to this righteous rule incline
16106,BOOK II.,All children of thine ancient line--
16107,BOOK II.,"Freely to give, reward each rite,"
16108,BOOK II.,Nor spare their bodies in the fight.
16109,BOOK II.,"Let Ráma Dasaratha be,"
16110,BOOK II.,"Look upon Sítá as on me,"
16111,BOOK II.,And let the cot wherein you dwell
16112,BOOK II.,"Be thine Ayodhyá. Fare thee well."""
16113,BOOK II.,Her blessing thus Sumitrá gave
16114,BOOK II.,"To him whose soul to Ráma clave,"
16115,BOOK II.,"Exclaiming, when her speech was done,"
16116,BOOK II.,"""Go forth, O Lakshman, go, my son."
16117,BOOK II.,"Go forth, my son to win success,"
16118,BOOK II.,High victory and happiness.
16119,BOOK II.,"Go forth thy foemen to destroy,"
16120,BOOK II.,"And turn again at last with joy."""
16121,BOOK II.,
16122,BOOK II.,As Mátali his charioteer
16123,BOOK II.,"Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,"
16124,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, palm to palm applied,"
16125,BOOK II.,"In reverence trained, to Ráma cried:"
16126,BOOK II.,"""O famous Prince, my car ascend,--"
16127,BOOK II.,"May blessings on thy course attend,--"
16128,BOOK II.,And swiftly shall my horses flee
16129,BOOK II.,And place thee where thou biddest me.
16130,BOOK II.,The fourteen years thou hast to stay
16131,BOOK II.,"Far in the wilds, begin to-day;"

16133,BOOK II.,
16134,BOOK II.,"Then Sítá, best of womankind,"
16135,BOOK II.,"Ascended, with a tranquil mind,"
16136,BOOK II.,"Soon as her toilet task was done,"
16137,BOOK II.,That chariot brilliant as the sun.
16138,BOOK II.,Ráma and Lakshman true and bold
16139,BOOK II.,Sprang on the car adorned with gold.
16140,BOOK II.,"The king those years had counted o'er,"
16141,BOOK II.,And given Sítá robes and store
16142,BOOK II.,Of precious ornaments to wear
16143,BOOK II.,When following her husband there.
16144,BOOK II.,The brothers in the car found place
16145,BOOK II.,"For nets and weapons of the chase,"
16146,BOOK II.,"There warlike arms and mail they laid,"
16147,BOOK II.,A leathern basket and a spade.
16148,BOOK II.,Soon as Sumantra saw the three
16149,BOOK II.,"Were seated in the chariot, he"
16150,BOOK II.,"Urged on each horse of noble breed,"
16151,BOOK II.,Who matched the rushing wind in speed.
16152,BOOK II.,As thus the son of Raghu went
16153,BOOK II.,"Forth for his dreary banishment,"
16154,BOOK II.,"Chill numbing grief the town assailed,"
16155,BOOK II.,"All strength grew weak, all spirit failed,"
16156,BOOK II.,Ayodhyá through her wide extent
16157,BOOK II.,Was filled with tumult and lament:
16158,BOOK II.,"Steeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,"
16159,BOOK II.,Each elephant returned a roar.
16160,BOOK II.,"Then all the city, young and old,"
16161,BOOK II.,"Wild with their sorrow uncontrolled,"
16162,BOOK II.,"Rushed to the car, as, from the sun"
16163,BOOK II.,The panting herds to water run.
16164,BOOK II.,"Before the car, behind, they clung,"
16165,BOOK II.,"And there as eagerly they hung,"
16166,BOOK II.,"With torrents streaming from their eyes,"
16167,BOOK II.,Called loudly with repeated cries:
16168,BOOK II.,"""Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;"
16169,BOOK II.,"Drive gently, and thy steeds restrain."
16170,BOOK II.,"Once more on Ráma will we gaze,"
16171,BOOK II.,Now to be lost for many days.
16172,BOOK II.,"The queen his mother has, be sure,"
16173,BOOK II.,"A heart of iron, to endure"
16174,BOOK II.,"To see her godlike Ráma go,"
16175,BOOK II.,Nor feel it shattered by the blow.
16176,BOOK II.,"Sítá, well done! Videha's pride,"
16177,BOOK II.,Still like his shadow by his side;
16178,BOOK II.,Rejoicing in thy duty still
16179,BOOK II.,As sunlight cleaves to Meru's hill.
16180,BOOK II.,"Thou, Lakshman, too, hast well deserved,"
16181,BOOK II.,"Who from thy duty hast not swerved,"
16182,BOOK II.,"Tending the peer of Gods above,"
16183,BOOK II.,Whose lips speak naught but words of love.

16189,BOOK II.,"The tears that down their faces rolled,"
16190,BOOK II.,While still they followed for a space
16191,BOOK II.,Their darling of Ikshváku's race.
16192,BOOK II.,
16193,BOOK II.,There stood surrounded by a ring
16194,BOOK II.,Of mournful wives the mournful king;
16195,BOOK II.,"For, ""I will see once more,"" he cried,"
16196,BOOK II.,"""Mine own dear son,"" and forth he hied."
16197,BOOK II.,"As he came near, there rose the sound"
16198,BOOK II.,"Of weeping, as the dames stood round."
16199,BOOK II.,So the she-elephants complain
16200,BOOK II.,When their great lord and guide is slain.
16201,BOOK II.,"Kakutstha's son, the king of men,"
16202,BOOK II.,"The glorious sire, looked troubled then,"
16203,BOOK II.,As the full moon is when dismayed
16204,BOOK II.,By dark eclipse's threatening shade.
16205,BOOK II.,"Then Dasaratha's son, designed"
16206,BOOK II.,"For highest fate of lofty mind,"
16207,BOOK II.,"Urged to more speed the charioteer,"
16208,BOOK II.,"""Away, away! why linger here?"
16209,BOOK II.,"Urge on thy horses,"" Rama cried,"
16210,BOOK II.,"And ""Stay, O stay,"" the people sighed."
16211,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, urged to speed away,"
16212,BOOK II.,"The townsmen's call must disobey,"
16213,BOOK II.,"Forth as the long-armed hero went,"
16214,BOOK II.,The dust his chariot wheels up sent
16215,BOOK II.,Was laid by streams that ever flowed
16216,BOOK II.,From their sad eyes who filled the road.
16217,BOOK II.,"Then, sprung of woe, from eyes of all"
16218,BOOK II.,"The women drops began to fall,"
16219,BOOK II.,As from each lotus on the lake
16220,BOOK II.,The darting fish the water shake.
16221,BOOK II.,"When he, the king of high renown,"
16222,BOOK II.,"Saw that one thought held all the town,"
16223,BOOK II.,"Like some tall tree he fell and lay,"
16224,BOOK II.,Whose root the axe has hewn away.
16225,BOOK II.,Then straight a mighty cry from those
16226,BOOK II.,"Who followed Ráma's car arose,"
16227,BOOK II.,Who saw their monarch fainting there
16228,BOOK II.,Beneath that grief too great to bear.
16229,BOOK II.,"Then ""Ráma, Ráma!"" with the cry"
16230,BOOK II.,"Of ""Ah, his mother!"" sounded high,"
16231,BOOK II.,As all the people wept aloud
16232,BOOK II.,Around the ladies' sorrowing crowd.
16233,BOOK II.,"When Ráma backward turned his eye,"
16234,BOOK II.,And saw the king his father lie
16235,BOOK II.,"With troubled sense and failing limb,"
16236,BOOK II.,"And the sad queen, who followed him,"
16237,BOOK II.,"Like some young creature in the net,"
16238,BOOK II.,"That will not, in its misery, let"
16239,BOOK II.,"Its wild eyes on its mother rest,"
16240,BOOK II.,"So, by the bonds of duty pressed,"
16241,BOOK II.,His mother's look he could not meet.
16242,BOOK II.,"He saw them with their weary feet,"
16243,BOOK II.,"Who, used to bliss, in cars should ride,"
16244,BOOK II.,"Who ne'er by sorrow should be tried,"
16245,BOOK II.,"And, as one mournful look he cast,"
16246,BOOK II.,"""Drive on,"" he cried, ""Sumantra, fast."""
16247,BOOK II.,As when the driver's torturing hook
16248,BOOK II.,"Goads on an elephant, the look"
16249,BOOK II.,Of sire and mother in despair
16250,BOOK II.,Was more than Ráma's heart could bear.
16251,BOOK II.,As mother kine to stalls return
16252,BOOK II.,"Which hold the calves for whom they yearn,"
16253,BOOK II.,So to the car she tried to run
16254,BOOK II.,As a cow seeks her little one.
16255,BOOK II.,Once and again the hero's eyes
16256,BOOK II.,"Looked on his mother, as with cries"
16257,BOOK II.,"Of woe she called and gestures wild,"
16258,BOOK II.,"""O Sítá, Lakshman, O my child!"""
16259,BOOK II.,"""Stay,"" cried the king, ""thy chariot stay:"""
16260,BOOK II.,"""On, on,"" cried Ráma, ""speed away."""
16261,BOOK II.,"As one between two hosts, inclined"
16262,BOOK II.,To neither was Sumantra's mind.
16263,BOOK II.,But Ráma spake these words again:
16264,BOOK II.,"""A lengthened woe is bitterest pain."
16265,BOOK II.,"On, on; and if his wrath grow hot,"
16266,BOOK II.,"Thine answer be, 'I heard thee not.' """
16267,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, at the chief's behest,"
16268,BOOK II.,"Dismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,"
16269,BOOK II.,"And, as he bade, to swiftest speed"
16270,BOOK II.,Urged on his way each willing steed.
16271,BOOK II.,"The king's attendants parted thence,"
16272,BOOK II.,And paid him heart-felt reverence:
16273,BOOK II.,"In mind, and with the tears he wept,"
16274,BOOK II.,Each still his place near Ráma kept.
16275,BOOK II.,"As swift away the horses sped,"
16276,BOOK II.,His lords to Dasaratha said:
16277,BOOK II.,"""To follow him whom thou again"
16278,BOOK II.,"Wouldst see returning home is vain."""
16279,BOOK II.,With failing limb and drooping mien
16280,BOOK II.,He heard their counsel wise:
16281,BOOK II.,Still on their son the king and queen
16282,BOOK II.,Kept fast their lingering eyes.(314)

16292,BOOK II.,But then the ladies' bower was rent
16293,BOOK II.,With cries of weeping and lament:
16294,BOOK II.,"""Where goes he now, our lord, the sure"
16295,BOOK II.,"Protector of the friendless poor,"
16296,BOOK II.,In whom the wretched and the weak
16297,BOOK II.,Defence and aid were wont to seek?
16298,BOOK II.,"All words of wrath he turned aside,"
16299,BOOK II.,"And ne'er, when cursed, in ire replied."
16300,BOOK II.,"He shared his people's woe, and stilled"

16320,BOOK II.,
16321,BOOK II.,"Then were no fires of worship fed,"
16322,BOOK II.,Thick darkness o'er the sun was spread.
16323,BOOK II.,"The cows their thirsty calves denied,"

16336,BOOK II.,When Ráma to the forest went.
16337,BOOK II.,And chilling grief and dark despair
16338,BOOK II.,Fell suddenly on all men there.
16339,BOOK II.,"Their wonted pastime all forgot,"
16340,BOOK II.,"Nor thought of food, or touched it not."
16341,BOOK II.,Crowds in the royal street were seen
16342,BOOK II.,With weeping eye and troubled mien:
16343,BOOK II.,"No more a people gay and glad,"
16344,BOOK II.,Each head and heart was sick and sad.
16345,BOOK II.,"No more the cool wind softly blew,"
16346,BOOK II.,"The moon no more was fair to view,"
16347,BOOK II.,No more the sun with genial glow
16348,BOOK II.,Cherished the world now plunged in woe.
16349,BOOK II.,"Sons, brothers, husbands, wedded wives"
16350,BOOK II.,Forgot the ties that joined their lives;
16351,BOOK II.,"No thought for kith and kin was spared,"
16352,BOOK II.,But all for only Ráma cared.
16353,BOOK II.,"And Ráma's friends who loved him best,"
16354,BOOK II.,Their minds disordered and distressed.
16355,BOOK II.,By the great burthen of their woes
16356,BOOK II.,Turned not to slumber or repose.

16374,BOOK II.,The glory of Ikshváku's race
16375,BOOK II.,Turned not away his eager face.
16376,BOOK II.,While yet his duteous son he saw
16377,BOOK II.,"He could not once his gaze withdraw,"
16378,BOOK II.,But rooted to the spot remained
16379,BOOK II.,With eyes that after Ráma strained.
16380,BOOK II.,"But when that dust no more he viewed,"
16381,BOOK II.,Fainting he fell by grief subdued.
16382,BOOK II.,"To his right hand Kausalyá went,"

16392,BOOK II.,"No loving wife, no friend to me,"

16407,BOOK II.,"Then while the dust upon him hung,"
16408,BOOK II.,"The monarch to Kausalyá clung,"
16409,BOOK II.,And she with mournful steps and slow
16410,BOOK II.,"Turned to the palace, worn with woe."
16411,BOOK II.,"As one whose hand has touched the fire,"
16412,BOOK II.,"Or slain a Bráhman in his ire,"
16413,BOOK II.,He felt his heart with sorrow torn

16419,BOOK II.,"He raised a cry, by woe distraught,"
16420,BOOK II.,As of his son again he thought.
16421,BOOK II.,And judging that the car had sped
16422,BOOK II.,"Beyond the city, thus he said:"
16423,BOOK II.,"""I still behold the foot-prints made"

16425,BOOK II.,"My son afar: these marks I see,"
16426,BOOK II.,"But high-souled Ráma, where is he?"
16427,BOOK II.,"Ah me, my son! my first and best,"
16428,BOOK II.,"On pleasant couches wont to rest,"
16429,BOOK II.,"With limbs perfumed with sandal, fanned"
16430,BOOK II.,By many a beauty's tender hand:
16431,BOOK II.,Where will he lie with log or stone
16432,BOOK II.,"Beneath him for a pillow thrown,"
16433,BOOK II.,"To leave at morn his earthy bed,"
16434,BOOK II.,"Neglected, and with dust o'erspread,"

16475,BOOK II.,The king renewed his sad lament:
16476,BOOK II.,With broken utterance faint and low
16477,BOOK II.,Scarce could he speak these words of woe:
16478,BOOK II.,"""My steps to Ráma's mother guide,"
16479,BOOK II.,And place me by Kausalyá's side:
16480,BOOK II.,"There, only there my heart may know"

16487,BOOK II.,But while he rested on the bed
16488,BOOK II.,Still was his soul disquieted.
16489,BOOK II.,In grief he tossed his arms on high
16490,BOOK II.,Lamenting with a piteous cry:

16844,BOOK II.,Sumantra from the chariot freed
16845,BOOK II.,With ready hand each weary steed;
16846,BOOK II.,"He groomed them with the utmost heed,"
16847,BOOK II.,
16848,BOOK II.,"Their limbs he bathed and dried,"
16849,BOOK II.,Then led them forth to drink and feed

16860,BOOK II.,"Arrived at that delightful place,"
16861,BOOK II.,"He looked on Sítá first, and then"
16862,BOOK II.,To Lakshman spake the lord of men:
16863,BOOK II.,"""Now first the shades of night descend"
16864,BOOK II.,Since to the wilds our steps we bend.
16865,BOOK II.,"Joy to thee, brother! do not grieve"
16866,BOOK II.,For our dear home and all we leave.
16867,BOOK II.,The woods unpeopled seem to weep
16868,BOOK II.,"Around us, as their tenants creep"
16869,BOOK II.,"Or fly to lair and den and nest,"
16870,BOOK II.,"Both bird and beast, to seek their rest."
16871,BOOK II.,Methinks Ayodhyá's royal town
16872,BOOK II.,"Where dwells my sire of high renown,"
16873,BOOK II.,With all her men and dames to-night
16874,BOOK II.,Will mourn us vanished from their sight.
16875,BOOK II.,"For, by his virtues won, they cling"
16876,BOOK II.,"In fond affection to their king,"
16877,BOOK II.,"And thee and me, O brave and true,"
16878,BOOK II.,And Bharat and Satrughna too.
16879,BOOK II.,I for my sire and mother feel
16880,BOOK II.,"Deep sorrow o'er my bosom steal,"
16881,BOOK II.,"Lest mourning us, oppressed with fears,"
16882,BOOK II.,They blind their eyes with endless tears.
16883,BOOK II.,Yet Bharat's duteous love will show
16884,BOOK II.,"Sweet comfort in their hours of woe,"
16885,BOOK II.,"And with kind words their hearts sustain,"
16886,BOOK II.,"Suggesting duty, bliss, and gain."
16887,BOOK II.,I mourn my parents now no more:
16888,BOOK II.,"I count dear Bharat's virtues o'er,"
16889,BOOK II.,And his kind love and care dispel
16890,BOOK II.,"The doubts I had, and all is well."
16891,BOOK II.,"And thou thy duty wouldst not shun,"
16892,BOOK II.,"And, following me, hast nobly done;"
16893,BOOK II.,"Else, bravest, I should need a band"
16894,BOOK II.,Around my wife as guard to stand.
16895,BOOK II.,"On this first night, my thirst to slake,"
16896,BOOK II.,Some water only will I take:

16904,BOOK II.,The sun had set: Sumantra tied
16905,BOOK II.,"His noble horses side by side,"
16906,BOOK II.,"Gave store of grass with liberal hand,"
16907,BOOK II.,And rested near them on the strand.
16908,BOOK II.,"Each paid the holy evening rite,"
16909,BOOK II.,"And when around them fell the night,"
16910,BOOK II.,"The charioteer, with Lakshman's aid,"
16911,BOOK II.,A lowly bed for Ráma laid.
16912,BOOK II.,"To Lakshman Ráma bade adieu,"
16913,BOOK II.,And then by Sítá's side he threw
16914,BOOK II.,His limbs upon the leafy bed
16915,BOOK II.,Their care upon the bank had spread.
16916,BOOK II.,"When Lakshman saw the couple slept,"
16917,BOOK II.,"Still on the strand his watch he kept,"
16918,BOOK II.,"Still with Sumantra there conversed,"
16919,BOOK II.,And Ráma's varied gifts rehearsed.
16920,BOOK II.,"All night he watched, nor sought repose,"
16921,BOOK II.,Till on the earth the sun arose:
16922,BOOK II.,"With him Sumantra stayed awake,"
16923,BOOK II.,And still of Ráma's virtues spake.
16924,BOOK II.,"Thus, near the river's grassy shore"
16925,BOOK II.,"Which herds unnumbered wandered o'er,"
16926,BOOK II.,"Repose, untroubled, Ráma found,"
16927,BOOK II.,And all the people lay around.
16928,BOOK II.,"The glorious hero left his bed,"
16929,BOOK II.,"Looked on the sleeping crowd, and said"
16930,BOOK II.,"To Lakshman, whom each lucky line"
16931,BOOK II.,Marked out for bliss with surest sign:
16932,BOOK II.,
16933,BOOK II.,"""O brother Lakshman, look on these"
16934,BOOK II.,Reclining at the roots of trees;
16935,BOOK II.,"All care of house and home resigned,"
16936,BOOK II.,"Caring for us with heart and mind,"
16937,BOOK II.,These people of the city yearn
16938,BOOK II.,To see us to our home return:
16939,BOOK II.,"To quit their lives will they consent,"
16940,BOOK II.,But never leave their firm intent.
16941,BOOK II.,"Come, while they all unconscious sleep,"
16942,BOOK II.,"Let us upon the chariot leap,"
16943,BOOK II.,And swiftly on our journey speed
16944,BOOK II.,"Where naught our progress may impede,"
16945,BOOK II.,That these fond citizens who roam
16946,BOOK II.,"Far from Ikshváku's ancient home,"
16947,BOOK II.,"No more may sleep 'neath bush and tree,"
16948,BOOK II.,Following still for love of me.
16949,BOOK II.,A prince with tender care should heal
16950,BOOK II.,"The self-brought woes his people feel,"
16951,BOOK II.,And never let his subjects share
16952,BOOK II.,"The burthen he is forced to bear."""
16953,BOOK II.,
16954,BOOK II.,"Then Lakshman to the chief replied,"
16955,BOOK II.,Who stood like Justice by his side:
16956,BOOK II.,"""Thy rede, O sage, I well commend:"
16957,BOOK II.,"Without delay the car ascend."""
16958,BOOK II.,Then Ráma to Sumantra spoke:
16959,BOOK II.,"""Thy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke."
16960,BOOK II.,Hence to the forest will I go:
16961,BOOK II.,"Away, my lord, and be not slow."""
16962,BOOK II.,
16963,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,"
16964,BOOK II.,"Yoked to the car each generous steed,"
16965,BOOK II.,"And then, with hand to hand applied,"
16966,BOOK II.,He came before the chief and cried:
16967,BOOK II.,"""Hail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,"
16968,BOOK II.,"Hail, bravest of the chariot-borne!"
16969,BOOK II.,With Sítá and thy brother thou
16970,BOOK II.,"Mayst mount: the car is ready now."""
16971,BOOK II.,
16972,BOOK II.,The hero clomb the car with haste:
16973,BOOK II.,"His bow and gear within were placed,"
16974,BOOK II.,And quick the eddying flood he passed
16975,BOOK II.,Of Tamasá whose waves run fast.
16976,BOOK II.,"Soon as he touched the farther side,"
16977,BOOK II.,"That strong-armed hero, glorified,"
16978,BOOK II.,"He found a road both wide and clear,"
16979,BOOK II.,Where e'en the timid naught could fear.
16980,BOOK II.,"Then, that the crowd might be misled,"
16981,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma to Sumantra said:
16982,BOOK II.,"""Speed north a while, then hasten back,"
16983,BOOK II.,"Returning in thy former track,"
16984,BOOK II.,That so the people may not learn
16985,BOOK II.,"The course I follow: drive and turn."""
16986,BOOK II.,
16987,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, at the chief's behest,"
16988,BOOK II.,Quick to the task himself addressed;
16989,BOOK II.,"Then near to Ráma came, and showed"
16990,BOOK II.,The chariot ready for the road.
16991,BOOK II.,"With Sítá, then, the princely two,"
16992,BOOK II.,Who o'er the line of Raghu threw
16993,BOOK II.,"A glory ever bright and new,"
16994,BOOK II.,Upon the chariot stood.
16995,BOOK II.,Sumantra fast and faster drove

17027,BOOK II.,"As a fond sire his children dear,--"
17028,BOOK II.,How can the pride of Raghu's race

17059,BOOK II.,"The chariot marks no more discerned,"

17256,BOOK II.,"Rolls onward till she meets the sea,"
17257,BOOK II.,The herd-frequented Gomatí.(321)
17258,BOOK II.,"Borne by his rapid horses o'er,"
17259,BOOK II.,He reached that river's further shore.
17260,BOOK II.,"And Syandiká's, whose swan-loved stream"
17261,BOOK II.,Resounded with the peacock's scream.
17262,BOOK II.,Then as he journeyed on his road
17263,BOOK II.,To his Videhan bride he showed
17264,BOOK II.,The populous land which Manu old
17265,BOOK II.,To King Ikshváku gave to hold.
17266,BOOK II.,"The glorious prince, the lord of men"
17267,BOOK II.,"Looked on the charioteer, and then"
17268,BOOK II.,"Voiced like a wild swan, loud and clear,"
17269,BOOK II.,He spake these words and bade him hear:
17270,BOOK II.,"""When shall I, with returning feet"
17271,BOOK II.,My father and my mother meet?
17272,BOOK II.,When shall I lead the hunt once more
17273,BOOK II.,In bloomy woods on Sarjú's shore?
17274,BOOK II.,Most eagerly I long to ride
17275,BOOK II.,Urging the chase on Sarjú's side.
17276,BOOK II.,For royal saints have seen no blame
17277,BOOK II.,"In this, the monarch's matchless game."""
17278,BOOK II.,
17279,BOOK II.,"Thus speeding on,--no rest or stay,--"
17280,BOOK II.,Ikshváku's son pursued his way.
17281,BOOK II.,"Oft his sweet voice the silence broke,"
17282,BOOK II.,And thus on varied themes he spoke.
17283,BOOK II.,
17284,BOOK II.,
17285,BOOK II.,
17286,BOOK II.,
17287,BOOK II.,Canto L. The Halt Under The Ingudí.(322)
17288,BOOK II.,
17289,BOOK II.,
17290,BOOK II.,So through the wide and fair extent
17291,BOOK II.,Of Kosala the hero went.
17292,BOOK II.,"Then toward Ayodhyá back he gazed,"
17293,BOOK II.,"And cried, with suppliant hands upraised:"
17294,BOOK II.,"""Farewell, dear city, first in place,"
17295,BOOK II.,Protected by Kakutstha's race!
17296,BOOK II.,"And Gods, who in thy temples dwell,"
17297,BOOK II.,And keep thine ancient citadel!
17298,BOOK II.,"I from his debt my sire will free,"
17299,BOOK II.,"Thy well-loved towers again will see,"
17300,BOOK II.,"And, coming from my wild retreat,"
17301,BOOK II.,"My mother and my father meet."""
17302,BOOK II.,
17303,BOOK II.,"Then burning grief inflamed his eye,"
17304,BOOK II.,"As his right arm he raised on high,"
17305,BOOK II.,"And, while hot tears his cheek bedewed,"
17306,BOOK II.,Addressed the mournful multitude:
17307,BOOK II.,"""By love and tender pity moved,"
17308,BOOK II.,Your love for me you well have proved;
17309,BOOK II.,"Now turn again with joy, and win"
17310,BOOK II.,"Success in all your hands begin."""
17311,BOOK II.,
17312,BOOK II.,"Before the high souled chief they bent,"
17313,BOOK II.,"With circling steps around him went,"
17314,BOOK II.,"And then with bitter wailing, they"
17315,BOOK II.,Departed each his several way.
17316,BOOK II.,"Like the great sun engulfed by night,"
17317,BOOK II.,"The hero sped beyond their sight,"
17318,BOOK II.,While still the people mourned his fate
17319,BOOK II.,And wept aloud disconsolate.
17320,BOOK II.,The car-borne chieftain passed the bound
17321,BOOK II.,"Of Kosala's delightful ground,"
17322,BOOK II.,"Where grain and riches bless the land,"
17323,BOOK II.,And people give with liberal hand:
17324,BOOK II.,"A lovely realm unvexed by fear,"
17325,BOOK II.,Where countless shrines and stakes(323) appear:
17326,BOOK II.,"Where mango-groves and gardens grow,"
17327,BOOK II.,And streams of pleasant water flow:
17328,BOOK II.,"Where dwells content a well-fed race,"
17329,BOOK II.,And countless kine the meadows grace:
17330,BOOK II.,Filled with the voice of praise and prayer:
17331,BOOK II.,Each hamlet worth a monarch's care.
17332,BOOK II.,Before him three-pathed Gangá rolled
17333,BOOK II.,Her heavenly waters bright and cold;
17334,BOOK II.,"O'er her pure breast no weeds were spread,"
17335,BOOK II.,Her banks were hermit-visited.
17336,BOOK II.,The car-borne hero saw the tide
17337,BOOK II.,"That ran with eddies multiplied,"
17338,BOOK II.,And thus the charioteer addressed:
17339,BOOK II.,"""Here on the bank to-day we rest."
17340,BOOK II.,"Not distant from the river, see!"
17341,BOOK II.,There grows a lofty Ingudí
17342,BOOK II.,With blossoms thick on every spray:
17343,BOOK II.,"There rest we, charioteer, to-day."
17344,BOOK II.,"I on the queen of floods will gaze,"
17345,BOOK II.,"Whose holy stream has highest praise,"
17346,BOOK II.,"Where deer, and bird, and glittering snake,"
17347,BOOK II.,"God, Daitya, bard their pastime take."""
17348,BOOK II.,
17349,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, Lakshman gave assent,"
17350,BOOK II.,And with the steeds they thither went.
17351,BOOK II.,"When Ráma reached the lovely tree,"
17352,BOOK II.,"With Sítá and with Lakshman, he"
17353,BOOK II.,Alighted from the car: with speed
17354,BOOK II.,Sumantra loosed each weary steed.
17355,BOOK II.,"And, hand to hand in reverence laid,"
17356,BOOK II.,Stood near to Ráma in the shade.
17357,BOOK II.,"Ráma's dear friend, renowned by fame,"
17358,BOOK II.,"Who of Nisháda lineage came,"
17359,BOOK II.,"Guha, the mighty chief, adored"
17360,BOOK II.,"Through all the land as sovereign lord,"
17361,BOOK II.,Soon as he heard that prince renowned
17362,BOOK II.,"Was resting on Nisháda ground,"
17363,BOOK II.,Begirt by counsellor and peer
17364,BOOK II.,And many an honoured friend drew near.
17365,BOOK II.,"Soon as the monarch came in view,"
17366,BOOK II.,Ráma and Lakshman toward him flew.
17367,BOOK II.,"Then Guha, at the sight distressed,"
17368,BOOK II.,"His arms around the hero pressed,"
17369,BOOK II.,Laid both his hands upon his head
17370,BOOK II.,"Bowed to those lotus feet, and said:"
17371,BOOK II.,"""O Ráma, make thy wishes known,"
17372,BOOK II.,And be this kingdom as thine own.
17373,BOOK II.,"Who, mighty-armed, will ever see"
17374,BOOK II.,"A guest so dear as thou to me?"""
17375,BOOK II.,
17376,BOOK II.,He placed before him dainty fare
17377,BOOK II.,"Of every flavour, rich and rare,"
17378,BOOK II.,"Brought forth the gift for honoured guest,"
17379,BOOK II.,And thus again the chief addressed:
17380,BOOK II.,"""Welcome, dear Prince, whose arms are strong;"
17381,BOOK II.,These lands and all to thee belong.
17382,BOOK II.,"Thy servants we, our lord art thou;"
17383,BOOK II.,"Begin, good king, thine empire now."
17384,BOOK II.,"See, various food before thee placed,"
17385,BOOK II.,And cups to drink and sweets to taste
17386,BOOK II.,"For thee soft beds are hither borne,"
17387,BOOK II.,"And for thy horses grass and corn."""
17388,BOOK II.,
17389,BOOK II.,"To Guha as he pressed and prayed,"
17390,BOOK II.,Thus Raghu's son his answer made:
17391,BOOK II.,"""'Twas aye thy care my heart to please"
17392,BOOK II.,"With honour, love, and courtesies,"
17393,BOOK II.,And friendship brings thee now to greet
17394,BOOK II.,"Thy guest thus humbly on thy feet."""
17395,BOOK II.,
17396,BOOK II.,"Again the hero spake, as round"
17397,BOOK II.,The king his shapely arms he wound:
17398,BOOK II.,"""Guha, I see that all is well"
17399,BOOK II.,With thee and those who with thee dwell;
17400,BOOK II.,That health and bliss and wealth attend
17401,BOOK II.,"Thy realm, thyself, and every friend."
17402,BOOK II.,"But all these friendly gifts of thine,"
17403,BOOK II.,"Bound to refuse, I must decline."
17404,BOOK II.,"Grass, bark, and hide my only wear,"
17405,BOOK II.,"And woodland roots and fruit my fare,"
17406,BOOK II.,On duty all my heart is set;
17407,BOOK II.,"I seek the woods, an anchoret."
17408,BOOK II.,A little grass and corn to feed
17409,BOOK II.,The horses--this is all I need.
17410,BOOK II.,"So by this favour, King, alone"
17411,BOOK II.,Shall honour due to me be shown.
17412,BOOK II.,For these good steeds who brought me here
17413,BOOK II.,Are to my sire supremely dear;
17414,BOOK II.,And kind attention paid to these
17415,BOOK II.,"Will honour me and highly please."""
17416,BOOK II.,
17417,BOOK II.,Then Guha quickly bade his train
17418,BOOK II.,"Give water to the steeds, and grain."
17419,BOOK II.,"And Ráma, ere the night grew dark,"
17420,BOOK II.,"Paid evening rites in dress of bark,"
17421,BOOK II.,"And tasted water, on the strand,"
17422,BOOK II.,Drawn from the stream by Lakshman's hand.
17423,BOOK II.,And Lakshman with observance meet
17424,BOOK II.,"Bathed his beloved brother's feet,"
17425,BOOK II.,Who rested with his Maithil spouse:
17426,BOOK II.,Then sat him down 'neath distant boughs.
17427,BOOK II.,And Guha with his bow sat near
17428,BOOK II.,"To Lakshman and the charioteer,"
17429,BOOK II.,And with the prince conversing kept
17430,BOOK II.,His faithful watch while Ráma slept.
17431,BOOK II.,"As Dasaratha's glorious heir,"
17432,BOOK II.,"Of lofty soul and wisdom rare,"
17433,BOOK II.,Reclining with his Sítá there
17434,BOOK II.,Beside the river lay--
17435,BOOK II.,"He who no troubles e'er had seen,"
17436,BOOK II.,Whose life a life of bliss had been--

17447,BOOK II.,"By unaffected love impelled,"
17448,BOOK II.,"Guha, whose heart the sight distressed,"
17449,BOOK II.,With words like these the prince addressed:
17450,BOOK II.,"""Beloved youth, this pleasant bed"

17462,BOOK II.,Through his dear grace supreme renown

17466,BOOK II.,While Raghu's son and Sítá lie
17467,BOOK II.,"Entranced in happy slumber, I"
17468,BOOK II.,"Will, with my trusty bow in hand,"

17480,BOOK II.,"With Sítá on his lowly bed,--"
17481,BOOK II.,How can I sleep? how can I care

17483,BOOK II.,"Behold the conquering chief, whose might"

17661,BOOK II.,"My mother, Queen Kausalyá, greet"
17662,BOOK II.,With reverence to her sacred feet.
17663,BOOK II.,"And add this prayer of mine: ""O King;"
17664,BOOK II.,"Send quickly forth and Bharat bring,"
17665,BOOK II.,And set him on the royal throne
17666,BOOK II.,Which thy decree has made his own.
17667,BOOK II.,"When he upon the throne is placed,"
17668,BOOK II.,"When thy fond arms are round him laced,"
17669,BOOK II.,Thine aged heart will cease to ache
17670,BOOK II.,"With bitter pangs for Ráma's sake."""
17671,BOOK II.,"And say to Bharat: ""See thou treat"
17672,BOOK II.,The queens with all observance meet:
17673,BOOK II.,"What care the king receives, the same"
17674,BOOK II.,Show thou alike to every dame.
17675,BOOK II.,Obedience to thy father's will
17676,BOOK II.,"Who chooses thee the throne to fill,"
17677,BOOK II.,Will earn for thee a store of bliss
17678,BOOK II.,"Both in the world to come and this.' """
17679,BOOK II.,
17680,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma bade Sumantra go
17681,BOOK II.,With thoughtful care instructed so.
17682,BOOK II.,"Sumantra all his message heard,"
17683,BOOK II.,"And spake again, by passion stirred:"
17684,BOOK II.,"""O, should deep feeling mar in aught"
17685,BOOK II.,"The speech by fond devotion taught,"
17686,BOOK II.,Forgive whate'er I wildly speak:
17687,BOOK II.,"My love is strong, my tongue is weak."
17688,BOOK II.,"How shall I, if deprived of thee,"
17689,BOOK II.,Return that mournful town to see:
17690,BOOK II.,Where sick at heart the people are
17691,BOOK II.,Because their Ráma roams afar.
17692,BOOK II.,Woe will be theirs too deep to brook
17693,BOOK II.,"When on the empty car they look,"
17694,BOOK II.,"As when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,"
17695,BOOK II.,One charioteer comes home again.
17696,BOOK II.,"This very day, I ween, is food"
17697,BOOK II.,"Forsworn by all the multitude,"
17698,BOOK II.,"Thinking that thou, with hosts to aid,"
17699,BOOK II.,Art dwelling in the wild wood's shade.
17700,BOOK II.,"The great despair, the shriek of woe"
17701,BOOK II.,"They uttered when they saw thee go,"
17702,BOOK II.,"Will, when I come with none beside,"
17703,BOOK II.,A hundred-fold be multiplied.
17704,BOOK II.,How to Kausalyá can I say:
17705,BOOK II.,"""O Queen, I took thy son away,"
17706,BOOK II.,And with thy brother left him well:
17707,BOOK II.,"Weep not for him; thy woe dispel?"""
17708,BOOK II.,"So false a tale I cannot frame,"
17709,BOOK II.,Yet how speak truth and grieve the dame?
17710,BOOK II.,"How shall these horses, fleet and bold,"
17711,BOOK II.,"Whom not a hand but mine can hold,"
17712,BOOK II.,"Bear others, wont to whirl the car"
17713,BOOK II.,Wherein Ikshváku's children are!
17714,BOOK II.,"Without thee, Prince, I cannot, no,"
17715,BOOK II.,I cannot to Ayodhyá go.
17716,BOOK II.,"Then deign, O Ráma, to relent,"
17717,BOOK II.,And let me share thy banishment.
17718,BOOK II.,"But if no prayers can move thy heart,"
17719,BOOK II.,"If thou wilt quit me and depart,"
17720,BOOK II.,"The flames shall end my car and me,"
17721,BOOK II.,Deserted thus and reft of thee.
17722,BOOK II.,"In the wild wood when foes are near,"
17723,BOOK II.,"When dangers check thy vows austere,"
17724,BOOK II.,"Borne in my car will I attend,"
17725,BOOK II.,All danger and all care to end.
17726,BOOK II.,For thy dear sake I love the skill
17727,BOOK II.,That guides the steed and curbs his will:
17728,BOOK II.,And soon a forest life will be
17729,BOOK II.,"As pleasant, for my love of thee."
17730,BOOK II.,"And if these horses near thee dwell,"
17731,BOOK II.,"And serve thee in the forest well,"
17732,BOOK II.,"They, for their service, will not miss"
17733,BOOK II.,The due reward of highest bliss.
17734,BOOK II.,"Thine orders, as with thee I stray,"
17735,BOOK II.,"Will I with heart and head obey,"
17736,BOOK II.,"Prepared, for thee, without a sigh,"
17737,BOOK II.,To lose Ayodhyá or the sky.
17738,BOOK II.,"As one defiled with hideous sin,"
17739,BOOK II.,I never more can pass within
17740,BOOK II.,"Ayodhyá, city of our king,"
17741,BOOK II.,Unless beside me thee I bring.
17742,BOOK II.,"One wish is mine, I ask no more,"
17743,BOOK II.,"That, when thy banishment is o'er"
17744,BOOK II.,"I in my car may bear my lord,"
17745,BOOK II.,"Triumphant, to his home restored."
17746,BOOK II.,"The fourteen years, if spent with thee,"
17747,BOOK II.,Will swift as light-winged moments flee;
17748,BOOK II.,"But the same years, without thee told,"
17749,BOOK II.,Were magnified a hundred-fold.
17750,BOOK II.,"Do not, kind lord, thy servant leave,"
17751,BOOK II.,"Who to his master's son would cleave,"
17752,BOOK II.,"And the same path with him pursue,"
17753,BOOK II.,"Devoted, tender, just and true."""
17754,BOOK II.,
17755,BOOK II.,"Again, again Sumantra made"
17756,BOOK II.,"His varied plaint, and wept and prayed."
17757,BOOK II.,"Him Raghu's son, whose tender breast"
17758,BOOK II.,"Felt for his servants, thus addressed:"
17759,BOOK II.,"""O faithful servant, well my heart"
17760,BOOK II.,Knows how attached and true thou art.
17761,BOOK II.,"Hear thou the words I speak, and know"
17762,BOOK II.,Why to the town I bid thee go.
17763,BOOK II.,"Soon as Kaikeyí, youngest queen,"
17764,BOOK II.,"Thy coming to the town has seen,"
17765,BOOK II.,No doubt will then her mind oppress
17766,BOOK II.,That Ráma roams the wilderness.
17767,BOOK II.,"And so the dame, her heart content"
17768,BOOK II.,"With proof of Ráma's banishment,"
17769,BOOK II.,Will doubt the virtuous king no more
17770,BOOK II.,As faithless to the oath he swore.
17771,BOOK II.,"Chief of my cares is this, that she,"
17772,BOOK II.,"Youngest amid the queens, may see"
17773,BOOK II.,Bharat her son securely reign
17774,BOOK II.,O'er rich Ayodhyá's wide domain.
17775,BOOK II.,For mine and for the monarch's sake
17776,BOOK II.,"Do thou thy journey homeward take,"
17777,BOOK II.,"And, as I bade, repeat each word"
17778,BOOK II.,"That from my lips thou here hast heard."""
17779,BOOK II.,
17780,BOOK II.,"Thus spake the prince, and strove to cheer"
17781,BOOK II.,"The sad heart of the charioteer,"
17782,BOOK II.,And then to royal Guha said
17783,BOOK II.,These words most wise and spirited:
17784,BOOK II.,"""Guha, dear friend, it is not meet"
17785,BOOK II.,That people throng my calm retreat:
17786,BOOK II.,"For I must live a strict recluse,"
17787,BOOK II.,And mould my life by hermits' use.
17788,BOOK II.,I now the ancient rule accept
17789,BOOK II.,By good ascetics gladly kept.
17790,BOOK II.,I go: bring fig-tree juice that I
17791,BOOK II.,"In matted coils my hair may tie."""
17792,BOOK II.,
17793,BOOK II.,"Quick Guha hastened to produce,"
17794,BOOK II.,"For the king's son, that sacred juice."
17795,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma of his long locks made,"
17796,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman's too, the hermit braid."
17797,BOOK II.,And the two royal brothers there
17798,BOOK II.,"With coats of bark and matted hair,"
17799,BOOK II.,Transformed in lovely likeness stood
17800,BOOK II.,To hermit saints who love the wood.
17801,BOOK II.,"So Ráma, with his brother bold,"
17802,BOOK II.,"A pious anchorite enrolled,"
17803,BOOK II.,"Obeyed the vow which hermits take,"
17804,BOOK II.,"And to his friend, King Guha, spake:"
17805,BOOK II.,"""May people, treasure, army share,"
17806,BOOK II.,"And fenced forts, thy constant care:"
17807,BOOK II.,Attend to all: supremely hard
17808,BOOK II.,"The sovereign's task, to watch and guard."""
17809,BOOK II.,
17810,BOOK II.,"Ikshváku's son, the good and brave,"
17811,BOOK II.,"This last farewell to Guha gave,"
17812,BOOK II.,"And then, with Lakshman and his bride,"
17813,BOOK II.,"Determined, on his way he hied."
17814,BOOK II.,"Soon as he viewed, upon the shore,"
17815,BOOK II.,The bark prepared to waft them o'er
17816,BOOK II.,"Impetuous Gangá's rolling tide,"
17817,BOOK II.,To Lakshman thus the chieftain cried:
17818,BOOK II.,"""Brother, embark; thy hand extend,"
17819,BOOK II.,Thy gentle aid to Sítá lend:
17820,BOOK II.,"With care her trembling footsteps guide,"
17821,BOOK II.,"And place the lady by thy side."""
17822,BOOK II.,"When Lakshman heard, prepared to aid,"
17823,BOOK II.,His brother's words he swift obeyed.
17824,BOOK II.,"Within the bark he placed the dame,"
17825,BOOK II.,Then to her side the hero came.
17826,BOOK II.,"Next Lakshman's elder brother, lord"
17827,BOOK II.,"Of brightest glory, when on board,"
17828,BOOK II.,"Breathing a prayer for blessings, meet"
17829,BOOK II.,"For priest or warrior to repeat,"
17830,BOOK II.,"Then he and car-borne Lakshman bent,"
17831,BOOK II.,"Well-pleased, their heads, most reverent,"
17832,BOOK II.,"Their hands, with Sítá, having dipped,"
17833,BOOK II.,"As Scripture bids, and water sipped,"
17834,BOOK II.,"Farewell to wise Sumantra said,"
17835,BOOK II.,"And Guha, with the train he led."
17836,BOOK II.,"So Ráma took, on board, his stand,"
17837,BOOK II.,And urged the vessel from the land.
17838,BOOK II.,Then swift by vigorous arms impelled
17839,BOOK II.,"Her onward course the vessel held,"
17840,BOOK II.,And guided by the helmsman through
17841,BOOK II.,The dashing waves of Gangá flew.
17842,BOOK II.,"Half way across the flood they came,"
17843,BOOK II.,"When Sítá, free from spot and blame,"
17844,BOOK II.,"Her reverent hands together pressed,"
17845,BOOK II.,The Goddess of the stream addressed:
17846,BOOK II.,"""May the great chieftain here who springs"
17847,BOOK II.,"From Dasaratha, best of kings,"
17848,BOOK II.,"Protected by thy care, fulfil"
17849,BOOK II.,His prudent father's royal will.
17850,BOOK II.,When in the forest he has spent
17851,BOOK II.,"His fourteen years of banishment,"
17852,BOOK II.,With his dear brother and with me
17853,BOOK II.,His home again my lord shall see.
17854,BOOK II.,"Returning on that blissful day,"
17855,BOOK II.,"I will to thee mine offerings pay,"
17856,BOOK II.,"Dear Queen, whose waters gently flow,"
17857,BOOK II.,Who canst all blessed gifts bestow.
17858,BOOK II.,"For, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,"
17859,BOOK II.,"Thy waves descend from Brahmá's sphere,"
17860,BOOK II.,"Spouse of the God o'er floods supreme,"
17861,BOOK II.,Though rolling here thy glorious stream.
17862,BOOK II.,"To thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,"
17863,BOOK II.,"To thee shall hymns of praise ascend,"
17864,BOOK II.,"When my brave lord shall turn again,"
17865,BOOK II.,"And, joyful, o'er his kingdom reign."
17866,BOOK II.,"To win thy grace, O Queen divine,"
17867,BOOK II.,"A hundred thousand fairest kine,"
17868,BOOK II.,And precious robes and finest meal
17869,BOOK II.,Among the Bráhmans will I deal.
17870,BOOK II.,"A hundred jars of wine shall flow,"
17871,BOOK II.,"When to my home, O Queen, I go;"
17872,BOOK II.,"With these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,"
17873,BOOK II.,"Will I, delighted, sacrifice."
17874,BOOK II.,"Each hallowed spot, each holy shrine"
17875,BOOK II.,"That stands on these fair shores of thine,"
17876,BOOK II.,Each fane and altar on thy banks
17877,BOOK II.,Shall share my offerings and thanks.
17878,BOOK II.,"With me and Lakshman, free from harm,"
17879,BOOK II.,"May he the blameless, strong of arm,"
17880,BOOK II.,"Reseek Ayodhyá from the wild,"
17881,BOOK II.,"O blameless Lady undefiled!"""
17882,BOOK II.,
17883,BOOK II.,"As, praying for her husband's sake,"
17884,BOOK II.,"The faultless dame to Gangá spake,"
17885,BOOK II.,To the right bank the vessel flew
17886,BOOK II.,With her whose heart was right and true.
17887,BOOK II.,"Soon as the bark had crossed the wave,"
17888,BOOK II.,"The lion leader of the brave,"
17889,BOOK II.,"Leaving the vessel on the strand,"
17890,BOOK II.,With wife and brother leapt to land.
17891,BOOK II.,Then Ráma thus the prince addressed
17892,BOOK II.,Who filled with joy Sumitrá's breast:
17893,BOOK II.,"""Be thine alike to guard and aid"
17894,BOOK II.,"In peopled spot, in lonely shade."
17895,BOOK II.,"Do thou, Sumitrá's son, precede:"
17896,BOOK II.,Let Sítá walk where thou shalt lead.
17897,BOOK II.,"Behind you both my place shall be,"
17898,BOOK II.,To guard the Maithil dame and thee.
17899,BOOK II.,"For she, to woe a stranger yet,"
17900,BOOK II.,No toil or grief till now has met;
17901,BOOK II.,The fair Videhan will assay
17902,BOOK II.,The pains of forest life to-day.
17903,BOOK II.,To-day her tender feet must tread
17904,BOOK II.,Rough rocky wilds around her spread:
17905,BOOK II.,"No tilth is there, no gardens grow,"
17906,BOOK II.,"No crowding people come and go."""
17907,BOOK II.,
17908,BOOK II.,The hero ceased: and Lakshman led
17909,BOOK II.,Obedient to the words he said:
17910,BOOK II.,"And Sítá followed him, and then"
17911,BOOK II.,"Came Raghu's pride, the lord of men."
17912,BOOK II.,With Sítá walking o'er the sand
17913,BOOK II.,"They sought the forest, bow in hand,"
17914,BOOK II.,But still their lingering glances threw
17915,BOOK II.,Where yet Sumantra stood in view.
17916,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, when his watchful eye"
17917,BOOK II.,"The royal youths no more could spy,"
17918,BOOK II.,Turned from the spot whereon he stood
17919,BOOK II.,Homeward with Guha from the wood.
17920,BOOK II.,Still on the brothers forced their way
17921,BOOK II.,"Where sweet birds sang on every spray,"
17922,BOOK II.,Though scarce the eye a path could find
17923,BOOK II.,Mid flowering trees where creepers twined.
17924,BOOK II.,"Far on the princely brothers pressed,"
17925,BOOK II.,And stayed their feet at length to rest
17926,BOOK II.,Beneath a fig tree's mighty shade
17927,BOOK II.,With countless pendent shoots displayed.
17928,BOOK II.,"Reclining there a while at ease,"
17929,BOOK II.,"They saw, not far, beneath fair trees"
17930,BOOK II.,A lake with many a lotus bright
17931,BOOK II.,That bore the name of Lovely Sight.
17932,BOOK II.,"Ráma his wife's attention drew,"
17933,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman's, to the charming view:"
17934,BOOK II.,"""Look, brother, look how fair the flood"
17935,BOOK II.,"Glows with the lotus, flower and bud!"""
17936,BOOK II.,
17937,BOOK II.,"They drank the water fresh and clear,"
17938,BOOK II.,And with their shafts they slew a deer.
17939,BOOK II.,"A fire of boughs they made in haste,"
17940,BOOK II.,And in the flame the meat they placed.
17941,BOOK II.,So Raghu's sons with Sítá shared
17942,BOOK II.,"The hunter's meal their hands prepared,"
17943,BOOK II.,Then counselled that the spreading tree
17944,BOOK II.,Their shelter and their home should be.

17972,BOOK II.,And many a pleasant tale rehearsed:

17974,BOOK II.,In broken sleep will sadly pass.

17986,BOOK II.,"And all his wisdoms overthrow,"
17987,BOOK II.,"Love is, methinks, of greater might"
17988,BOOK II.,To stir the heart than gain and right.

18097,BOOK II.,"Under the boughs that o'er them bent,"
18098,BOOK II.,"And when the sun his glory spread,"
18099,BOOK II.,"Upstarting, from the place they sped."
18100,BOOK II.,"On to that spot they made their way,"
18101,BOOK II.,"Through the dense wood that round them lay,"
18102,BOOK II.,Where Yamuná's(326) swift waters glide
18103,BOOK II.,To blend with Gangá's holy tide.
18104,BOOK II.,Charmed with the prospect ever new
18105,BOOK II.,The glorious heroes wandered through
18106,BOOK II.,"Full many a spot of pleasant ground,"
18107,BOOK II.,"Rejoicing as they gazed around,"
18108,BOOK II.,"With eager eye and heart at ease,"
18109,BOOK II.,On countless sorts of flowery trees.
18110,BOOK II.,And now the day was half-way sped
18111,BOOK II.,When thus to Lakshman Ráma said:
18112,BOOK II.,"""There, there, dear brother, turn thine eyes;"

18127,BOOK II.,"They reached the hermit's dwelling, set"
18128,BOOK II.,Near where the rushing waters met.
18129,BOOK II.,The presence of the warrior scared
18130,BOOK II.,"The deer and birds as on he fared,"
18131,BOOK II.,And struck them with unwonted awe:
18132,BOOK II.,Then Bharadvája's cot they saw.
18133,BOOK II.,The high-souled hermit soon they found
18134,BOOK II.,Girt by his dear disciples round:
18135,BOOK II.,"Calm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,"
18136,BOOK II.,Whose fervent rites keen sight had bought.
18137,BOOK II.,Duly had flames of worship blazed
18138,BOOK II.,When Ráma on the hermit gazed:
18139,BOOK II.,"His suppliant hands the hero raised,"
18140,BOOK II.,Drew nearer to the holy man
18141,BOOK II.,"With his companions, and began,"
18142,BOOK II.,Declaring both his name and race
18143,BOOK II.,And why they sought that distant place:
18144,BOOK II.,"""Saint, Dasaratha's children we,"

18162,BOOK II.,"And honour-gifts in dishes full,"
18163,BOOK II.,"And drink and food of varied taste,"
18164,BOOK II.,"Berries and roots, before him placed,"
18165,BOOK II.,And then the great ascetic showed
18166,BOOK II.,A cottage for the guests' abode.
18167,BOOK II.,The saint these honours gladly paid
18168,BOOK II.,"To Ráma who had thither strayed,"
18169,BOOK II.,Then compassed sat by birds and deer
18170,BOOK II.,And many a hermit resting near.
18171,BOOK II.,"The prince received the service kind,"
18172,BOOK II.,And sat him down rejoiced in mind.
18173,BOOK II.,"Then Bharadvája silence broke,"
18174,BOOK II.,And thus the words of duty spoke:
18175,BOOK II.,"""Kakutstha's royal son, that thou"
18176,BOOK II.,Hadst sought this grove I knew ere now.
18177,BOOK II.,"Mine ears have heard thy story, sent"

18189,BOOK II.,"""My honoured lord, this tranquil spot,"
18190,BOOK II.,"Fair home of hermits, suits me not:"
18191,BOOK II.,For all the neighbouring people here

18201,BOOK II.,
18202,BOOK II.,The hermit heard the prayer he made:
18203,BOOK II.,"A while in earnest thought he stayed,"
18204,BOOK II.,And then in words like these expressed
18205,BOOK II.,His answer to the chief's request:
18206,BOOK II.,"""Ten leagues away there stands a hill"
18207,BOOK II.,"Where thou mayst live, if such thy will:"
18208,BOOK II.,"A holy mount, exceeding fair;"
18209,BOOK II.,Great saints have made their dwelling there:
18210,BOOK II.,"There great Langúrs(328) in thousands play,"
18211,BOOK II.,And bears amid the thickets stray;
18212,BOOK II.,"Wide-known by Chitrakúta's name,"
18213,BOOK II.,It rivals Gandhamádan's(329) fame.
18214,BOOK II.,Long as the man that hill who seeks

18216,BOOK II.,To holy things his soul he gives
18217,BOOK II.,And pure from thought of evil lives.

18231,BOOK II.,
18232,BOOK II.,"Thus to Prayág the hero went,"
18233,BOOK II.,"Thus saw the saint preëminent,"
18234,BOOK II.,And varied speeches heard and said:

18236,BOOK II.,"And Ráma took, by toil oppressed,"
18237,BOOK II.,"With Sítá and his brother, rest;"
18238,BOOK II.,"And so the night, with sweet content,"
18239,BOOK II.,In Bharadvája's grove was spent.
18240,BOOK II.,"But when the dawn dispelled the night,"
18241,BOOK II.,"Ráma approached the anchorite,"
18242,BOOK II.,And thus addressed the holy sire

18247,BOOK II.,"For their new home his grove to quit."""
18248,BOOK II.,
18249,BOOK II.,"Then, as he saw the morning break,"

18471,BOOK II.,
18472,BOOK II.,"Then the great saint, in duty trained,"
18473,BOOK II.,With honour gladly entertained:
18474,BOOK II.,"He gave his guests a welcome fair,"
18475,BOOK II.,"And bade them sit and rest them there,"
18476,BOOK II.,Ráma of mighty arm and chest
18477,BOOK II.,His faithful Lakshman then addressed:
18478,BOOK II.,"""Brother, bring hither from the wood"
18479,BOOK II.,"Selected timber strong and good,"
18480,BOOK II.,And build therewith a little cot;
18481,BOOK II.,My heart rejoices in the spot
18482,BOOK II.,"That lies beneath the mountain's side,"
18483,BOOK II.,"Remote, with water well supplied."""
18484,BOOK II.,
18485,BOOK II.,"Sumitrá's son his words obeyed,"
18486,BOOK II.,"Brought many a tree, and deftly made,"
18487,BOOK II.,"With branches in the forest cut,"

18489,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, when the cottage stood"
18490,BOOK II.,"Fair, firmly built, and walled with wood,"
18491,BOOK II.,"To Lakshman spake, whose eager mind"
18492,BOOK II.,To do his brother's will inclined:
18493,BOOK II.,"""Now, Lakshman as our cot is made,"
18494,BOOK II.,Must sacrifice be duly paid
18495,BOOK II.,"By us, for lengthened life who hope,"
18496,BOOK II.,With venison of the antelope.
18497,BOOK II.,"Away, O bright-eyed Lakshman, speed:"
18498,BOOK II.,Struck by thy bow a deer must bleed:
18499,BOOK II.,"As Scripture bids, we must not slight"
18500,BOOK II.,"The duty that commands the rite."""
18501,BOOK II.,
18502,BOOK II.,"Lakshman, the chief whose arrows laid"
18503,BOOK II.,"His foemen low, his word obeyed;"
18504,BOOK II.,And Ráma thus again addressed
18505,BOOK II.,The swift performer of his hest:
18506,BOOK II.,"""Prepare the venison thou hast shot,"
18507,BOOK II.,To sacrifice for this our cot.
18508,BOOK II.,"Haste, brother dear, for this the hour,"
18509,BOOK II.,"And this the day of certain power."""
18510,BOOK II.,Then glorious Lakshman took the buck
18511,BOOK II.,His arrow in the wood had struck;
18512,BOOK II.,"Bearing his mighty load he came,"
18513,BOOK II.,And laid it in the kindled flame.
18514,BOOK II.,"Soon as he saw the meat was done,"
18515,BOOK II.,And that the juices ceased to run
18516,BOOK II.,"From the broiled carcass, Lakshman then"
18517,BOOK II.,Spoke thus to Ráma best of men:
18518,BOOK II.,"""The carcass of the buck, entire,"
18519,BOOK II.,Is ready dressed upon the fire.
18520,BOOK II.,Now be the sacred rites begun

18522,BOOK II.,
18523,BOOK II.,"Ráma the good, in ritual trained,"
18524,BOOK II.,"Pure from the bath, with thoughts restrained,"
18525,BOOK II.,Hasted those verses to repeat
18526,BOOK II.,Which make the sacrifice complete.
18527,BOOK II.,"The hosts celestial came in view,"
18528,BOOK II.,"And Ráma to the cot withdrew,"
18529,BOOK II.,While a sweet sense of rapture stole
18530,BOOK II.,Through the unequalled hero's soul.
18531,BOOK II.,He paid the Visvedevas(332) due.
18532,BOOK II.,"And Rudra's right, and Vishnu's too,"
18533,BOOK II.,"Nor wonted blessings, to protect"
18534,BOOK II.,"Their new-built home, did he neglect."
18535,BOOK II.,"With voice repressed he breathed the prayer,"
18536,BOOK II.,"Bathed duly in the river fair,"
18537,BOOK II.,And gave good offerings that remove
18538,BOOK II.,"The stain of sin, as texts approve."
18539,BOOK II.,"And many an altar there he made,"
18540,BOOK II.,"And shrines, to suit the holy shade,"
18541,BOOK II.,"All decked with woodland chaplets sweet,"
18542,BOOK II.,"And fruit and roots and roasted meat,"
18543,BOOK II.,"With muttered prayer, as texts require,"
18544,BOOK II.,"Water, and grass and wood and fire."
18545,BOOK II.,"So Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá paid"
18546,BOOK II.,"Their offerings to each God and shade,"
18547,BOOK II.,And entered then their pleasant cot
18548,BOOK II.,That bore fair signs of happy lot.
18549,BOOK II.,"They entered, the illustrious three,"
18550,BOOK II.,"The well-set cottage, fair to see,"
18551,BOOK II.,"Roofed with the leaves of many a tree,"

18555,BOOK II.,To their own glorious council hall
18556,BOOK II.,Advance in shining train.
18557,BOOK II.,"So, resting on that lovely hill,"
18558,BOOK II.,"Near the fair lily-covered rill,"
18559,BOOK II.,"The happy prince forgot,"
18560,BOOK II.,"Surrounded by the birds and deer,"

18571,BOOK II.,King Guha's heart with sorrow sank:
18572,BOOK II.,"He with Sumantra talked, and spent"
18573,BOOK II.,"With his deep sorrow, homeward went."
18574,BOOK II.,"Sumantra, as the king decreed,"
18575,BOOK II.,"Yoked to the car each noble steed,"
18576,BOOK II.,And to Ayodhyá's city sped
18577,BOOK II.,With his sad heart disquieted.
18578,BOOK II.,On lake and brook and scented grove
18579,BOOK II.,"His glances fell, as on he drove:"
18580,BOOK II.,City and village came in view
18581,BOOK II.,As o'er the road his coursers flew.
18582,BOOK II.,"On the third day the charioteer,"
18583,BOOK II.,"When now the hour of night was near,"
18584,BOOK II.,"Came to Ayodhyá's gate, and found"
18585,BOOK II.,The city all in sorrow drowned.
18586,BOOK II.,"To him, in spirit quite cast down,"
18587,BOOK II.,"Forsaken seemed the silent town,"
18588,BOOK II.,And by the rush of grief oppressed
18589,BOOK II.,He pondered in his mournful breast:
18590,BOOK II.,"""Is all Ayodhyá burnt with grief,"
18591,BOOK II.,"Steed, elephant, and man, and chief?"
18592,BOOK II.,Does her loved Ráma's exile so
18593,BOOK II.,"Afflict her with the fires of woe?"""
18594,BOOK II.,"Thus as he mused, his steeds flew fast,"
18595,BOOK II.,And swiftly through the gate he passed.
18596,BOOK II.,"On drove the charioteer, and then"
18597,BOOK II.,"In hundreds, yea in thousands, men"
18598,BOOK II.,"Ran to the car from every side,"
18599,BOOK II.,"And, ""Ráma, where is Ráma?"" cried."
18600,BOOK II.,"Sumantra said: ""My chariot bore"
18601,BOOK II.,The duteous prince to Gangá's shore;
18602,BOOK II.,"I left him there at his behest,"
18603,BOOK II.,"And homeward to Ayodhyá pressed."""
18604,BOOK II.,Soon as the anxious people knew
18605,BOOK II.,That he was o'er the flood they drew
18606,BOOK II.,"Deep sighs, and crying, Ráma! all"
18607,BOOK II.,"Wailed, and big tears began to fall."
18608,BOOK II.,"He heard the mournful words prolonged,"
18609,BOOK II.,As here and there the people thronged:
18610,BOOK II.,"""Woe, woe for us, forlorn, undone,"
18611,BOOK II.,No more to look on Raghu's son!
18612,BOOK II.,"His like again we ne'er shall see,"
18613,BOOK II.,"Of heart so true, of hand so free,"
18614,BOOK II.,"In gifts, in gatherings for debate,"

18617,BOOK II.,"Can rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?"""
18618,BOOK II.,
18619,BOOK II.,"Thus the sad town, which Ráma kept"
18620,BOOK II.,"As a kind father, wailed and wept."
18621,BOOK II.,"Each mansion, as the car went by,"
18622,BOOK II.,"Sent forth a loud and bitter cry,"
18623,BOOK II.,"As to the window every dame,"
18624,BOOK II.,"Mourning for banished Ráma, came."
18625,BOOK II.,"As his sad eyes with tears o'erflowed,"
18626,BOOK II.,He sped along the royal road
18627,BOOK II.,To Dasaratha's high abode.
18628,BOOK II.,There leaping down his car he stayed;
18629,BOOK II.,Within the gates his way he made;
18630,BOOK II.,Through seven broad courts he onward hied
18631,BOOK II.,Where people thronged on every side.
18632,BOOK II.,"From each high terrace, wild with woe,"
18633,BOOK II.,The royal ladies flocked below:
18634,BOOK II.,"He heard them talk in gentle tone,"
18635,BOOK II.,As each for Ráma made her moan:
18636,BOOK II.,"""What will the charioteer reply"

18640,BOOK II.,"Hard is a life with woe distressed,"
18641,BOOK II.,"But difficult to win is rest,"

18644,BOOK II.,
18645,BOOK II.,Such was the speech Sumantra heard
18646,BOOK II.,From them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.
18647,BOOK II.,"As fires of anguish burnt him through,"
18648,BOOK II.,"Swift to the monarch's hall he drew,"
18649,BOOK II.,"Past the eighth court; there met his sight,"
18650,BOOK II.,"The sovereign in his palace bright,"
18651,BOOK II.,"Still weeping for his son, forlorn,"
18652,BOOK II.,"Pale, faint, and all with sorrow worn."
18653,BOOK II.,"As there he sat, Sumantra bent"
18654,BOOK II.,"And did obeisance reverent,"
18655,BOOK II.,And to the king repeated o'er
18656,BOOK II.,The message he from Ráma bore.
18657,BOOK II.,"The monarch heard, and well-nigh brake"
18658,BOOK II.,"His heart, but yet no word he spake:"
18659,BOOK II.,"Fainting to earth he fell, and dumb,"
18660,BOOK II.,By grief for Ráma overcome.
18661,BOOK II.,"Rang through the hall a startling cry,"
18662,BOOK II.,"And women's arms were tossed on high,"
18663,BOOK II.,"When, with his senses all astray,"
18664,BOOK II.,Upon the ground the monarch lay.
18665,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá, with Sumitrá's aid,"
18666,BOOK II.,Raised from the ground her lord dismayed:
18667,BOOK II.,"""Sire, of high fate,"" she cried, ""O, why"

18882,BOOK II.,Or birds sit pensive on the tree.
18883,BOOK II.,"Where'er I look, its beauty o'er,"
18884,BOOK II.,The pleasance charms not as before.
18885,BOOK II.,I drove through fair Ayodhyá's street:
18886,BOOK II.,None flew with joy the car to meet.
18887,BOOK II.,"They saw that Ráma was not there,"
18888,BOOK II.,And turned them sighing in despair.
18889,BOOK II.,The people in the royal way
18890,BOOK II.,"Wept tears of bitter grief, when they"
18891,BOOK II.,"Beheld me coming, from afar,"
18892,BOOK II.,No Ráma with me in the car.
18893,BOOK II.,From palace roof and turret high
18894,BOOK II.,Each woman bent her eager eye;
18895,BOOK II.,"She looked for Ráma, but in vain;"
18896,BOOK II.,Gazed on the car and shrieked for pain.
18897,BOOK II.,Their long clear eyes with sorrow drowned
18898,BOOK II.,"They, when this common grief was found,"
18899,BOOK II.,"Looked each on other, friend and foe,"
18900,BOOK II.,In sympathy of levelling woe:
18901,BOOK II.,No shade of difference between
18902,BOOK II.,"Foe, friend, or neutral, there was seen."
18903,BOOK II.,"Without a joy, her bosom rent"
18904,BOOK II.,"With grief for Ráma's banishment,"

18907,BOOK II.,
18908,BOOK II.,"He ended: and the king, distressed."
18909,BOOK II.,With sobbing voice that lord addressed:
18910,BOOK II.,"""Ah me, by false Kaikeyí led,"
18911,BOOK II.,"Of evil race, to evil bred,"
18912,BOOK II.,"I took no counsel of the sage,"
18913,BOOK II.,"Nor sought advice from skill and age,"
18914,BOOK II.,"I asked no lord his aid to lend,"
18915,BOOK II.,I called no citizen or friend.
18916,BOOK II.,"Rash was my deed, bereft of sense"
18917,BOOK II.,Slave to a woman's influence.
18918,BOOK II.,"Surely, my lord, a woe so great"
18919,BOOK II.,Falls on us by the will of Fate;
18920,BOOK II.,"It lays the house of Raghu low,"
18921,BOOK II.,For Destiny will have it so.
18922,BOOK II.,"I pray thee, if I e'er have done"
18923,BOOK II.,"An act to please thee, yea, but one,"
18924,BOOK II.,"Fly, fly, and Ráma homeward lead:"
18925,BOOK II.,"My life, departing, counsels speed."
18926,BOOK II.,"Fly, ere the power to bid I lack,"
18927,BOOK II.,Fly to the wood: bring Ráma back.
18928,BOOK II.,I cannot live for even one
18929,BOOK II.,Short hour bereaved of my son.
18930,BOOK II.,"But ah, the prince, whose arms are strong,"
18931,BOOK II.,Has journeyed far: the way is long:
18932,BOOK II.,"Me, me upon the chariot place,"
18933,BOOK II.,And let me look on Ráma's face.
18934,BOOK II.,"Ah me, my son, mine eldest-born,"
18935,BOOK II.,"Where roams he in the wood forlorn,"
18936,BOOK II.,"The wielder of the mighty bow,"
18937,BOOK II.,Whose shoulders like the lion's show?
18938,BOOK II.,"O, ere the light of life be dim,"

18947,BOOK II.,"Sunk in affliction's sea, too wide"
18948,BOOK II.,"To traverse, in his anguish cried:"
18949,BOOK II.,"""Hard, hard to pass, my Queen, this sea"
18950,BOOK II.,Of sorrow raging over me:
18951,BOOK II.,"No Ráma near to soothe mine eye,"
18952,BOOK II.,Plunged in its lowest deeps I lie.
18953,BOOK II.,"Sorrow for Ráma swells the tide,"
18954,BOOK II.,And Sítá's absence makes it wide:
18955,BOOK II.,"My tears its foamy flood distain,"
18956,BOOK II.,Made billowy by my sighs of pain:
18957,BOOK II.,"My cries its roar, the arms I throw"
18958,BOOK II.,"About me are the fish below,"
18959,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí is the fire that feeds
18960,BOOK II.,Beneath: my hair the tangled weeds:
18961,BOOK II.,Its source the tears for Ráma shed:
18962,BOOK II.,The hump-back's words its monsters dread:
18963,BOOK II.,"The boon I gave the wretch its shore,"
18964,BOOK II.,Till Ráma's banishment be o'er.(334)

19002,BOOK II.,"Will guard the feet of Ráma there,"
19003,BOOK II.,"Earning, with governed sense, the prize"

19013,BOOK II.,E'en as of old she used to rove
19014,BOOK II.,"Delighted in the city's grove,"
19015,BOOK II.,"Thus, even thus she joys to tread"

19017,BOOK II.,"Like a young child, her face as fair"
19018,BOOK II.,"As the young moon, she wanders there."
19019,BOOK II.,What though in lonely woods she stray
19020,BOOK II.,Still Ráma is her joy and stay:
19021,BOOK II.,"All his the heart no sorrow bends,"

19027,BOOK II.,"Marks various trees that meet her eye,"

19030,BOOK II.,One little league away from home
19031,BOOK II.,When Ráma or his brother speaks
19032,BOOK II.,And gives the answer that she seeks.
19033,BOOK II.,"This, Lady, I remember well,"

19052,BOOK II.,A lotus glory where they tread.
19053,BOOK II.,In sportive grace she walks the ground
19054,BOOK II.,And sweet her chiming anklets sound.
19055,BOOK II.,No jewels clasp the faultless limb:
19056,BOOK II.,She leaves them all for love of him.

19108,BOOK II.,"Who loved the music and the song,"

19281,BOOK II.,
19282,BOOK II.,
19283,BOOK II.,But soon by rankling grief oppressed
19284,BOOK II.,"The king awoke from troubled rest,"
19285,BOOK II.,And his sad heart was tried again
19286,BOOK II.,With anxious thought where all was pain.
19287,BOOK II.,Ráma and Lakshman's mournful fate
19288,BOOK II.,"On Dasaratha, good and great"
19289,BOOK II.,"As Indra, pressed with crushing weight,"
19290,BOOK II.,As when the demon's might assails
19291,BOOK II.,"The Sun-God, and his glory pales."
19292,BOOK II.,"Ere yet the sixth long night was spent,"
19293,BOOK II.,"Since Ráma to the woods was sent,"
19294,BOOK II.,The king at midnight sadly thought
19295,BOOK II.,"Of the old crime his hand had wrought,"
19296,BOOK II.,And thus to Queen Kausalyá cried
19297,BOOK II.,Who still for Ráma moaned and sighed:
19298,BOOK II.,"""If thou art waking, give, I pray,"
19299,BOOK II.,Attention to the words I say.
19300,BOOK II.,"Whate'er the conduct men pursue,"
19301,BOOK II.,"Be good or ill the acts they do,"
19302,BOOK II.,"Be sure, dear Queen, they find the meed"
19303,BOOK II.,Of wicked or of virtuous deed.
19304,BOOK II.,A heedless child we call the man
19305,BOOK II.,Whose feeble judgment fails to scan
19306,BOOK II.,"The weight of what his hands may do,"
19307,BOOK II.,"Its lightness, fault, and merit too."
19308,BOOK II.,"One lays the Mango garden low,"
19309,BOOK II.,And bids the gay Palásas grow:
19310,BOOK II.,"Longing for fruit their bloom he sees,"
19311,BOOK II.,But grieves when fruit should bend the trees.
19312,BOOK II.,"Cut by my hand, my fruit-trees fell,"
19313,BOOK II.,Palása trees I watered well.
19314,BOOK II.,"My hopes this foolish heart deceive,"
19315,BOOK II.,And for my banished son I grieve.
19316,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá, in my youthful prime"
19317,BOOK II.,"Armed with my bow I wrought the crime,"
19318,BOOK II.,"Proud of my skill, my name renowned,"
19319,BOOK II.,An archer prince who shoots by sound.
19320,BOOK II.,The deed this hand unwitting wrought
19321,BOOK II.,"This misery on my soul has brought,"
19322,BOOK II.,As children seize the deadly cup
19323,BOOK II.,And blindly drink the poison up.
19324,BOOK II.,As the unreasoning man may be
19325,BOOK II.,"Charmed with the gay Palása tree,"
19326,BOOK II.,I unaware have reaped the fruit
19327,BOOK II.,Of joying at a sound to shoot.
19328,BOOK II.,"As regent prince I shared the throne,"
19329,BOOK II.,"Thou wast a maid to me unknown,"
19330,BOOK II.,"The early Rain-time duly came,"
19331,BOOK II.,And strengthened love's delicious flame.
19332,BOOK II.,The sun had drained the earth that lay
19333,BOOK II.,"All glowing 'neath the summer day,"
19334,BOOK II.,And to the gloomy clime had fled
19335,BOOK II.,Where dwell the spirits of the dead.(335)
19336,BOOK II.,"The fervent heat that moment ceased,"
19337,BOOK II.,The darkening clouds each hour increased
19338,BOOK II.,And frogs and deer and peacocks all
19339,BOOK II.,Rejoiced to see the torrents fall.
19340,BOOK II.,"Their bright wings heavy from the shower,"
19341,BOOK II.,"The birds, new-bathed, had scarce the power"
19342,BOOK II.,To reach the branches of the trees
19343,BOOK II.,Whose high tops swayed beneath the breeze.
19344,BOOK II.,"The fallen rain, and falling still,"
19345,BOOK II.,"Hung like a sheet on every hill,"
19346,BOOK II.,"Till, with glad deer, each flooded steep"
19347,BOOK II.,Showed glorious as the mighty deep.
19348,BOOK II.,The torrents down its wooded side
19349,BOOK II.,"Poured, some unstained, while others dyed"
19350,BOOK II.,"Gold, ashy, silver, ochre, bore"
19351,BOOK II.,The tints of every mountain ore.
19352,BOOK II.,"In that sweet time, when all are pleased,"
19353,BOOK II.,My arrows and my bow I seized;
19354,BOOK II.,"Keen for the chase, in field or grove,"
19355,BOOK II.,Down Sarjú's bank my car I drove.
19356,BOOK II.,I longed with all my lawless will
19357,BOOK II.,"Some elephant by night to kill,"
19358,BOOK II.,"Some buffalo that came to drink,"
19359,BOOK II.,"Or tiger, at the river's brink."
19360,BOOK II.,"When all around was dark and still,"
19361,BOOK II.,"I heard a pitcher slowly fill,"
19362,BOOK II.,"And thought, obscured in deepest shade,"
19363,BOOK II.,An elephant the sound had made.
19364,BOOK II.,"I drew a shaft that glittered bright,"
19365,BOOK II.,Fell as a serpent's venomed bite;
19366,BOOK II.,"I longed to lay the monster dead,"
19367,BOOK II.,And to the mark my arrow sped.
19368,BOOK II.,"Then in the calm of morning, clear"
19369,BOOK II.,A hermit's wailing smote my ear:
19370,BOOK II.,"""Ah me, ah me,"" he cried, and sank,"
19371,BOOK II.,"Pierced by my arrow, on the bank."
19372,BOOK II.,"E'en as the weapon smote his side,"
19373,BOOK II.,I heard a human voice that cried:
19374,BOOK II.,"""Why lights this shaft on one like me,"
19375,BOOK II.,A poor and harmless devotee?
19376,BOOK II.,I came by night to fill my jar
19377,BOOK II.,From this lone stream where no men are.
19378,BOOK II.,"Ah, who this deadly shaft has shot?"
19379,BOOK II.,"Whom have I wronged, and knew it not?"
19380,BOOK II.,Why should a boy so harmless feel
19381,BOOK II.,The vengeance of the winged steel?
19382,BOOK II.,Or who should slay the guiltless son
19383,BOOK II.,"Of hermit sire who injures none,"
19384,BOOK II.,"Who dwells retired in woods, and there"
19385,BOOK II.,Supports his life on woodland fare?
19386,BOOK II.,"Ah me, ah me, why am I slain,"
19387,BOOK II.,What booty will the murderer gain?
19388,BOOK II.,"In hermit coils I bind my hair,"
19389,BOOK II.,Coats made of skin and bark I wear.
19390,BOOK II.,"Ah, who the cruel deed can praise"
19391,BOOK II.,"Whose idle toil no fruit repays,"
19392,BOOK II.,As impious as the wretch's crime
19393,BOOK II.,Who dares his master's bed to climb?
19394,BOOK II.,Nor does my parting spirit grieve
19395,BOOK II.,But for the life which thus I leave:
19396,BOOK II.,"Alas, my mother and my sire,--"
19397,BOOK II.,I mourn for them when I expire.
19398,BOOK II.,"Ah me, that aged, helpless pair,"
19399,BOOK II.,"Long cherished by my watchful care,"
19400,BOOK II.,How will it be with them this day
19401,BOOK II.,When to the Five(336) I pass away?
19402,BOOK II.,"Pierced by the self-same dart we die,"
19403,BOOK II.,"Mine aged mother, sire, and I."
19404,BOOK II.,"Whose mighty hand, whose lawless mind"
19405,BOOK II.,"Has all the three to death consigned?"""
19406,BOOK II.,
19407,BOOK II.,"When I, by love of duty stirred,"
19408,BOOK II.,"That touching lamentation heard,"
19409,BOOK II.,"Pierced to the heart by sudden woe,"
19410,BOOK II.,I threw to earth my shafts and bow.
19411,BOOK II.,My heart was full of grief and dread
19412,BOOK II.,"As swiftly to the place I sped,"
19413,BOOK II.,"Where, by my arrow wounded sore,"
19414,BOOK II.,A hermit lay on Sarjú's shore.
19415,BOOK II.,"His matted hair was all unbound,"
19416,BOOK II.,"His pitcher empty on the ground,"
19417,BOOK II.,"And by the fatal arrow pained,"
19418,BOOK II.,He lay with dust and gore distained.
19419,BOOK II.,I stood confounded and amazed:
19420,BOOK II.,"His dying eyes to mine he raised,"
19421,BOOK II.,"And spoke this speech in accents stern,"
19422,BOOK II.,As though his light my soul would burn:
19423,BOOK II.,"""How have I wronged thee, King, that I"
19424,BOOK II.,Struck by thy mortal arrow die?
19425,BOOK II.,"The wood my home, this jar I brought,"
19426,BOOK II.,And water for my parents sought.
19427,BOOK II.,This one keen shaft that strikes me through
19428,BOOK II.,Slays sire and aged mother too.
19429,BOOK II.,"Feeble and blind, in helpless pain,"
19430,BOOK II.,They wait for me and thirst in vain.
19431,BOOK II.,"They with parched lips their pangs must bear,"
19432,BOOK II.,And hope will end in blank despair.
19433,BOOK II.,"Ah me, there seems no fruit in store"
19434,BOOK II.,"For holy zeal or Scripture lore,"
19435,BOOK II.,Or else ere now my sire would know
19436,BOOK II.,That his dear son is lying low.
19437,BOOK II.,"Yet, if my mournful fate he knew,"
19438,BOOK II.,What could his arm so feeble do?
19439,BOOK II.,"The tree, firm-rooted, ne'er may be"
19440,BOOK II.,The guardian of a stricken tree.
19441,BOOK II.,"Haste to my father, and relate"
19442,BOOK II.,"While time allows, my sudden fate,"
19443,BOOK II.,Lest he consume thee as the fire
19444,BOOK II.,"Burns up the forest, in his ire."
19445,BOOK II.,"This little path, O King, pursue:"
19446,BOOK II.,My father's cot thou soon wilt view.
19447,BOOK II.,"There sue for pardon to the sage,"
19448,BOOK II.,Lest he should curse thee in his rage.
19449,BOOK II.,First from the wound extract the dart
19450,BOOK II.,"That kills me with its deadly smart,"
19451,BOOK II.,E'en as the flushed impetuous tide
19452,BOOK II.,"Eats through the river's yielding side."""
19453,BOOK II.,
19454,BOOK II.,"I feared to draw the arrow out,"
19455,BOOK II.,And pondered thus in painful doubt:
19456,BOOK II.,"""Now tortured by the shaft he lies,"
19457,BOOK II.,"But if I draw it forth he dies."""
19458,BOOK II.,"Helpless I stood, faint, sorely grieved:"
19459,BOOK II.,The hermit's son my thought perceived;
19460,BOOK II.,As one o'ercome by direst pain
19461,BOOK II.,He scarce had strength to speak again.
19462,BOOK II.,"With writhing limb and struggling breath,"
19463,BOOK II.,Nearer and ever nearer death
19464,BOOK II.,"""My senses undisturbed remain,"
19465,BOOK II.,And fortitude has conquered pain:
19466,BOOK II.,Now from one tear thy soul be freed.
19467,BOOK II.,Thy hand has made a Bráhman bleed.
19468,BOOK II.,Let not this pang thy bosom wring:
19469,BOOK II.,"No twice-born youth am I, O King,"
19470,BOOK II.,"For of a Vaisya sire I came,"
19471,BOOK II.,"Who wedded with a Súdra dame."""
19472,BOOK II.,
19473,BOOK II.,"These words the boy could scarcely say,"
19474,BOOK II.,"As tortured by the shaft he lay,"
19475,BOOK II.,"Twisting his helpless body round,"
19476,BOOK II.,Then trembling senseless on the ground.
19477,BOOK II.,Then from his bleeding side I drew
19478,BOOK II.,The rankling shaft that pierced him through.
19479,BOOK II.,"With death's last fear my face he eyed,"
19480,BOOK II.,"And, rich in store of penance, died."""

19485,BOOK II.,Canto LXIV. Dasaratha's Death.
19486,BOOK II.,
19487,BOOK II.,
19488,BOOK II.,The son of Raghu to his queen
19489,BOOK II.,"Thus far described the unequalled scene,"
19490,BOOK II.,"And, as the hermit's death he rued,"
19491,BOOK II.,The mournful story thus renewed:
19492,BOOK II.,"""The deed my heedless hand had wrought"
19493,BOOK II.,"Perplexed me with remorseful thought,"
19494,BOOK II.,And all alone I pondered still
19495,BOOK II.,How kindly deed might salve the ill.
19496,BOOK II.,"The pitcher from the ground I took,"
19497,BOOK II.,"And filled it from that fairest brook,"
19498,BOOK II.,"Then, by the path the hermit showed,"
19499,BOOK II.,I reached his sainted sire's abode.
19500,BOOK II.,"I came, I saw: the aged pair,"
19501,BOOK II.,"Feeble and blind, were sitting there,"
19502,BOOK II.,"Like birds with clipped wings, side by side,"
19503,BOOK II.,With none their helpless steps to guide.
19504,BOOK II.,Their idle hours the twain beguiled
19505,BOOK II.,"With talk of their returning child,"
19506,BOOK II.,"And still the cheering hope enjoyed,"
19507,BOOK II.,"The hope, alas, by me destroyed."
19508,BOOK II.,"Then spoke the sage, as drawing near"
19509,BOOK II.,The sound of footsteps reached his ear:
19510,BOOK II.,"""Dear son, the water quickly bring;"
19511,BOOK II.,Why hast thou made this tarrying?
19512,BOOK II.,"Thy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,"
19513,BOOK II.,And bathing in the brook delayed.
19514,BOOK II.,She weeps because thou camest not;
19515,BOOK II.,"Haste, O my son, within the cot."
19516,BOOK II.,If she or I have ever done
19517,BOOK II.,"A thing to pain thee, dearest son,"
19518,BOOK II.,Dismiss the memory from thy mind:
19519,BOOK II.,"A hermit thou, be good and kind."
19520,BOOK II.,"On thee our lives, our all, depend:"
19521,BOOK II.,Thou art thy friendless parents' friend.
19522,BOOK II.,The eyeless couple's eye art thou:
19523,BOOK II.,"Then why so cold and silent now?"""
19524,BOOK II.,
19525,BOOK II.,With sobbing voice and bosom wrung
19526,BOOK II.,"I scarce could move my faltering tongue,"
19527,BOOK II.,And with my spirit filled with dread
19528,BOOK II.,"I looked upon the sage, and said,"
19529,BOOK II.,"While mind, and sense, and nerve I strung"
19530,BOOK II.,"To fortify my trembling tongue,"
19531,BOOK II.,And let the aged hermit know
19532,BOOK II.,"His son's sad fate, my fear and woe:"
19533,BOOK II.,"""High-minded Saint, not I thy child,"
19534,BOOK II.,"A warrior, Dasaratha styled."
19535,BOOK II.,I bear a grievous sorrow's weight
19536,BOOK II.,Born of a deed which good men hate.
19537,BOOK II.,"My lord, I came to Sarjú's shore,"
19538,BOOK II.,And in my hand my bow I bore
19539,BOOK II.,For elephant or beast of chase
19540,BOOK II.,That seeks by night his drinking place.
19541,BOOK II.,There from the stream a sound I heard
19542,BOOK II.,As if a jar the water stirred.
19543,BOOK II.,"An elephant, I thought, was nigh:"
19544,BOOK II.,"I aimed, and let an arrow fly."
19545,BOOK II.,"Swift to the place I made my way,"
19546,BOOK II.,And there a wounded hermit lay
19547,BOOK II.,Gasping for breath: the deadly dart
19548,BOOK II.,Stood quivering in his youthful heart.
19549,BOOK II.,I hastened near with pain oppressed;
19550,BOOK II.,He faltered out his last behest.
19551,BOOK II.,"And quickly, as he bade me do,"
19552,BOOK II.,From his pierced side the shaft I drew.
19553,BOOK II.,"I drew the arrow from the rent,"
19554,BOOK II.,"And up to heaven the hermit went,"
19555,BOOK II.,"Lamenting, as from earth he passed,"
19556,BOOK II.,His aged parents to the last.
19557,BOOK II.,"Thus, unaware, the deed was done:"
19558,BOOK II.,"My hand, unwitting, killed thy son."
19559,BOOK II.,"For what remains, O, let me win"
19560,BOOK II.,"Thy pardon for my heedless sin."""
19561,BOOK II.,
19562,BOOK II.,As the sad tale of sin I told
19563,BOOK II.,The hermit's grief was uncontrolled.
19564,BOOK II.,"With flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,"
19565,BOOK II.,Thus spake the venerable saint:
19566,BOOK II.,"I stood with hand to hand applied,"
19567,BOOK II.,And listened as he spoke and sighed:
19568,BOOK II.,"""If thou, O King, hadst left unsaid"
19569,BOOK II.,"By thine own tongue this tale of dread,"
19570,BOOK II.,Thy head for hideous guilt accursed
19571,BOOK II.,Had in a thousand pieces burst.
19572,BOOK II.,"A hermit's blood by warrior spilt,"
19573,BOOK II.,"In such a case, with purposed guilt,"
19574,BOOK II.,Down from his high estate would bring
19575,BOOK II.,Even the thunder's mighty King.
19576,BOOK II.,And he a dart who conscious sends
19577,BOOK II.,Against the devotee who spends
19578,BOOK II.,His pure life by the law of Heaven--
19579,BOOK II.,That sinner's head will split in seven.
19580,BOOK II.,"Thou livest, for thy heedless hand"
19581,BOOK II.,"Has wrought a deed thou hast not planned,"
19582,BOOK II.,Else thou and all of Raghu's line
19583,BOOK II.,Had perished by this act of thine.
19584,BOOK II.,"Now guide us,"" thus the hermit said,"
19585,BOOK II.,"""Forth to the spot where he lies dead."
19586,BOOK II.,"Guide us, this day, O Monarch, we"
19587,BOOK II.,For the last time our son would see:
19588,BOOK II.,The hermit dress of skin he wore
19589,BOOK II.,Rent from his limbs distained with gore;
19590,BOOK II.,"His senseless body lying slain,"
19591,BOOK II.,"His soul in Yama's dark domain."""
19592,BOOK II.,
19593,BOOK II.,"Alone the mourning pair I led,"
19594,BOOK II.,"Their souls with woe disquieted,"
19595,BOOK II.,And let the dame and hermit lay
19596,BOOK II.,Their hands upon the breathless clay.
19597,BOOK II.,"The father touched his son, and pressed"
19598,BOOK II.,The body to his aged breast;
19599,BOOK II.,"Then falling by the dead boy's side,"
19600,BOOK II.,"He lifted up his voice, and cried:"
19601,BOOK II.,
19602,BOOK II.,"""Hast thou no word, my child, to say?"
19603,BOOK II.,No greeting for thy sire to-day?
19604,BOOK II.,"Why art thou angry, darling? why"
19605,BOOK II.,Wilt thou upon the cold earth lie?
19606,BOOK II.,"If thou, my son, art wroth with me,"
19607,BOOK II.,"Here, duteous child, thy mother see."
19608,BOOK II.,"What! no embrace for me, my son?"
19609,BOOK II.,No word of tender love--not one?
19610,BOOK II.,"Whose gentle voice, so soft and clear,"
19611,BOOK II.,"Soothing my spirit, shall I hear"
19612,BOOK II.,"When evening comes, with accents sweet"
19613,BOOK II.,Scripture or ancient lore repeat?
19614,BOOK II.,"Who, having fed the sacred fire,"
19615,BOOK II.,"And duly bathed, as texts require,"
19616,BOOK II.,"Will cheer, when evening rites are done,"
19617,BOOK II.,The father mourning for his son?
19618,BOOK II.,Who will the daily meal provide
19619,BOOK II.,"For the poor wretch who lacks a guide,"
19620,BOOK II.,Feeding the helpless with the best
19621,BOOK II.,"Berries and roots, like some dear guest?"
19622,BOOK II.,How can these hands subsistence find
19623,BOOK II.,"For thy poor mother, old and blind?"
19624,BOOK II.,"The wretched votaress how sustain,"
19625,BOOK II.,Who mourns her child in ceaseless pain?
19626,BOOK II.,"Stay yet a while, my darling, stay,"
19627,BOOK II.,Nor fly to Yama's realm to-day.
19628,BOOK II.,To-morrow I thy sire and she
19629,BOOK II.,"Who bare thee, child, will go with, thee.(337)"
19630,BOOK II.,"Then when I look on Yama, I"
19631,BOOK II.,To great Vivasvat's son will cry:
19632,BOOK II.,"""Hear, King of justice, and restore"
19633,BOOK II.,"Our child to feed us, I implore."
19634,BOOK II.,"Lord of the world, of mighty fame,"
19635,BOOK II.,"Faithful and just, admit my claim,"
19636,BOOK II.,And grant this single boon to free
19637,BOOK II.,"My soul from fear, to one like me."""
19638,BOOK II.,"Because, my son, untouched by stain,"
19639,BOOK II.,"By sinful hands thou fallest slain,"
19640,BOOK II.,"Win, through thy truth, the sphere where those"
19641,BOOK II.,Who die by hostile darts repose.
19642,BOOK II.,Seek the blest home prepared for all
19643,BOOK II.,"The valiant who in battle fall,"
19644,BOOK II.,"Who face the foe and scorn to yield,"
19645,BOOK II.,In glory dying on the field.
19646,BOOK II.,Rise to the heaven where Dhundhumár
19647,BOOK II.,"And Nahush, mighty heroes, are,"
19648,BOOK II.,Where Janamejay and the blest
19649,BOOK II.,"Dilípa, Sagar, Saivya, rest:"
19650,BOOK II.,"Home of all virtuous spirits, earned"
19651,BOOK II.,By fervent rites and Scripture learned:
19652,BOOK II.,"By those whose sacred fires have glowed,"
19653,BOOK II.,Whose liberal hands have fields bestowed:
19654,BOOK II.,"By givers of a thousand cows,"
19655,BOOK II.,By lovers of one faithful spouse:
19656,BOOK II.,"By those who serve their masters well,"
19657,BOOK II.,And cast away this earthly shell.
19658,BOOK II.,None of my race can ever know
19659,BOOK II.,The bitter pain of lasting woe.
19660,BOOK II.,But doomed to that dire fate is he
19661,BOOK II.,"Whose guilty hand has slaughtered thee."""
19662,BOOK II.,
19663,BOOK II.,Thus with wild tears the aged saint
19664,BOOK II.,"Made many a time his piteous plaint,"
19665,BOOK II.,Then with his wife began to shed
19666,BOOK II.,The funeral water for the dead.
19667,BOOK II.,"But in a shape celestial clad,"
19668,BOOK II.,"Won by the merits of the lad,"
19669,BOOK II.,The spirit from the body brake
19670,BOOK II.,And to the mourning parents spake:
19671,BOOK II.,"""A glorious home in realms above"
19672,BOOK II.,Rewards my care and filial love.
19673,BOOK II.,"You, honoured parents, soon shall be"
19674,BOOK II.,"Partakers of that home with me."""
19675,BOOK II.,
19676,BOOK II.,"He spake, and swiftly mounting high,"
19677,BOOK II.,"With Indra near him, to the sky"
19678,BOOK II.,"On a bright car, with flame that glowed,"
19679,BOOK II.,Sublime the duteous hermit rode.
19680,BOOK II.,
19681,BOOK II.,"The father, with his consort's aid,"
19682,BOOK II.,"The funeral rites with water paid,"
19683,BOOK II.,And thus his speech to me renewed
19684,BOOK II.,Who stood in suppliant attitude:
19685,BOOK II.,"""Slay me this day, O, slay me, King,"
19686,BOOK II.,For death no longer has a sting.
19687,BOOK II.,Childless am I: thy dart has done
19688,BOOK II.,"To death my dear, my only son."
19689,BOOK II.,Because the boy I loved so well
19690,BOOK II.,"Slain by thy heedless arrow fell,"
19691,BOOK II.,My curse upon thy soul shall press
19692,BOOK II.,With bitter woe and heaviness.
19693,BOOK II.,"I mourn a slaughtered child, and thou"
19694,BOOK II.,Shalt feel the pangs that kill me now.
19695,BOOK II.,"Bereft and suffering e'en as I,"
19696,BOOK II.,"So shalt thou mourn thy son, and die."
19697,BOOK II.,Thy hand unwitting dealt the blow
19698,BOOK II.,"That laid a holy hermit low,"
19699,BOOK II.,"And distant, therefore, is the time"
19700,BOOK II.,When thou shalt suffer for the crime.
19701,BOOK II.,"The hour shall come when, crushed by woes"
19702,BOOK II.,"Like these I feel, thy life shall close:"
19703,BOOK II.,A debt to pay in after days
19704,BOOK II.,"Like his the priestly fee who pays."""
19705,BOOK II.,
19706,BOOK II.,"This curse on me the hermit laid,"
19707,BOOK II.,Nor yet his tears and groans were stayed.
19708,BOOK II.,Then on the pyre their bodies cast
19709,BOOK II.,The pair; and straight to heaven they passed.
19710,BOOK II.,As in sad thought I pondered long
19711,BOOK II.,Back to my memory came the wrong
19712,BOOK II.,"Done in wild youth, O lady dear,"
19713,BOOK II.,When 'twas my boast to shoot by ear.
19714,BOOK II.,"The deed has borne the fruit, which now"
19715,BOOK II.,Hangs ripe upon the bending bough:
19716,BOOK II.,"Thus dainty meats the palate please,"
19717,BOOK II.,And lure the weak to swift disease.
19718,BOOK II.,Now on my soul return with dread
19719,BOOK II.,"The words that noble hermit said,"
19720,BOOK II.,"That I for a dear son should grieve,"
19721,BOOK II.,"And of the woe my life should leave."""
19722,BOOK II.,
19723,BOOK II.,Thus spake the king with many a tear;
19724,BOOK II.,Then to his wife he cried in fear:
19725,BOOK II.,"""I cannot see thee, love; but lay"
19726,BOOK II.,"Thy gentle hand in mine, I pray."
19727,BOOK II.,"Ah me, if Ráma touched me thus,"
19728,BOOK II.,"If once, returning home to us,"
19729,BOOK II.,"He bade me wealth and lordship give,"
19730,BOOK II.,"Then, so I think, my soul would live."
19731,BOOK II.,"Unlike myself, unjust and mean"
19732,BOOK II.,"Have been my ways with him, my Queen,"
19733,BOOK II.,"But like himself is all that he,"
19734,BOOK II.,"My noble son, has done to me."
19735,BOOK II.,"His son, though far from right he stray,"
19736,BOOK II.,What prudent sire would cast away?
19737,BOOK II.,"What banished son would check his ire,"
19738,BOOK II.,Nor speak reproaches of his sire?
19739,BOOK II.,"I see thee not: these eyes grow blind,"
19740,BOOK II.,And memory quits my troubled mind.
19741,BOOK II.,Angels of Death are round me: they
19742,BOOK II.,Summon my soul with speed away.
19743,BOOK II.,"What woe more grievous can there be,"
19744,BOOK II.,"That, when from light and life I flee,"
19745,BOOK II.,"I may not, ere I part, behold"
19746,BOOK II.,"My virtuous Ráma, true and bold?"
19747,BOOK II.,"Grief for my son, the brave and true,"
19748,BOOK II.,"Whose joy it was my will to do,"
19749,BOOK II.,"Dries up my breath, as summer dries"
19750,BOOK II.,The last drop in the pool that lies.
19751,BOOK II.,"Not men, but blessed Gods, are they"
19752,BOOK II.,Whose eyes shall see his face that day;
19753,BOOK II.,"See him, when fourteen years are past,"
19754,BOOK II.,With earrings decked return at last.
19755,BOOK II.,My fainting mind forgets to think:
19756,BOOK II.,Low and more low my spirits sink.
19757,BOOK II.,"Each from its seat, my senses steal:"
19758,BOOK II.,"I cannot hear, or taste, or feel."
19759,BOOK II.,This lethargy of soul o'ercomes
19760,BOOK II.,"Each organ, and its function numbs:"
19761,BOOK II.,"So when the oil begins to fail,"
19762,BOOK II.,The torch's rays grow faint and pale.
19763,BOOK II.,This flood of woe caused by this hand
19764,BOOK II.,"Destroys me helpless and unmanned,"
19765,BOOK II.,Resistless as the floods that bore
19766,BOOK II.,A passage through the river shore.
19767,BOOK II.,"Ah Raghu's son, ah mighty-armed,"
19768,BOOK II.,"By whom my cares were soothed and charmed,"
19769,BOOK II.,"My son in whom I took delight,"
19770,BOOK II.,Now vanished from thy father's sight!
19771,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá, ah, I cannot see;"
19772,BOOK II.,"Sumitrá, gentle devotee!"
19773,BOOK II.,"Alas, Kaikeyí, cruel dame,"
19774,BOOK II.,"My bitter foe, thy father's shame!"""
19775,BOOK II.,
19776,BOOK II.,Kausalyá and Sumitrá kept
19777,BOOK II.,Their watch beside him as he wept.
19778,BOOK II.,"And Dasaratha moaned and sighed,"
19779,BOOK II.,And grieving for his darling died.

19788,BOOK II.,And brightly dawned another day;
19789,BOOK II.,"The minstrels, trained to play and sing,"
19790,BOOK II.,Flocked to the chamber of the king:
19791,BOOK II.,"Bards, who their gayest raiment wore,"
19792,BOOK II.,And heralds famed for ancient lore:
19793,BOOK II.,"And singers, with their songs of praise,"
19794,BOOK II.,Made music in their several ways.
19795,BOOK II.,There as they poured their blessings choice
19796,BOOK II.,"And hailed their king with hand and voice,"
19797,BOOK II.,Their praises with a swelling roar
19798,BOOK II.,Echoed through court and corridor.
19799,BOOK II.,"Then as the bards his glory sang,"
19800,BOOK II.,"From beaten palms loud answer rang,"
19801,BOOK II.,"As glad applauders clapped their hands,"
19802,BOOK II.,And told his deeds in distant lands.
19803,BOOK II.,The swelling concert woke a throng
19804,BOOK II.,Of sleeping birds to life and song:
19805,BOOK II.,"Some in the branches of the trees,"
19806,BOOK II.,Some caged in halls and galleries.
19807,BOOK II.,Nor was the soft string music mute;
19808,BOOK II.,"The gentle whisper of the lute,"
19809,BOOK II.,And blessings sung by singers skilled
19810,BOOK II.,The palace of the monarch filled.
19811,BOOK II.,"Eunuchs and dames of life unstained,"
19812,BOOK II.,"Each in the arts of waiting trained,"
19813,BOOK II.,"Drew near attentive as before,"
19814,BOOK II.,And crowded to the chamber door:
19815,BOOK II.,These skilful when and how to shed
19816,BOOK II.,"The lustral stream o'er limb and head,"
19817,BOOK II.,Others with golden ewers stood
19818,BOOK II.,Of water stained with sandal wood.
19819,BOOK II.,"And many a maid, pure, young, and fair,"
19820,BOOK II.,"Her load of early offerings bare,"
19821,BOOK II.,"Cups of the flood which all revere,"
19822,BOOK II.,"And sacred things, and toilet gear."
19823,BOOK II.,Each several thing was duly brought
19824,BOOK II.,"As rule of old observance taught,"
19825,BOOK II.,And lucky signs on each impressed
19826,BOOK II.,Stamped it the fairest and the best.
19827,BOOK II.,"There anxious, in their long array,"
19828,BOOK II.,All waited till the shine of day:
19829,BOOK II.,"But when the king nor rose nor spoke,"
19830,BOOK II.,Doubt and alarm within them woke.
19831,BOOK II.,"Forthwith the dames, by duty led,"
19832,BOOK II.,"Attendants on the monarch's bed,"
19833,BOOK II.,Within the royal chamber pressed
19834,BOOK II.,To wake their master from his rest.
19835,BOOK II.,"Skilled in the lore of dreaming, they"
19836,BOOK II.,First touched the bed on which he lay.
19837,BOOK II.,"But none replied; no sound was heard,"
19838,BOOK II.,"Nor hand, nor head, nor body stirred."
19839,BOOK II.,"They trembled, and their dread increased,"
19840,BOOK II.,"Fearing his breath of life had ceased,"
19841,BOOK II.,"And bending low their heads, they shook"
19842,BOOK II.,Like the tall reeds that fringe the brook.
19843,BOOK II.,"In doubt and terror down they knelt,"
19844,BOOK II.,"Looked on his face, his cold hand felt,"
19845,BOOK II.,And then the gloomy truth appeared
19846,BOOK II.,Of all their hearts had darkly feared.
19847,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá and Sumitrá, worn"
19848,BOOK II.,"With weeping for their sons, forlorn,"
19849,BOOK II.,"Woke not, but lay in slumber deep"
19850,BOOK II.,And still as death's unending sleep.
19851,BOOK II.,"Bowed down by grief, her colour fled,"
19852,BOOK II.,"Her wonted lustre dull and dead,"
19853,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá shone not, like a star"
19854,BOOK II.,Obscured behind a cloudy bar.
19855,BOOK II.,"Beside the king's her couch was spread,"
19856,BOOK II.,"And next was Queen Sumitrá's bed,"
19857,BOOK II.,"Who shone no more with beauty's glow,"
19858,BOOK II.,Her face bedewed with tears of woe.
19859,BOOK II.,"There lapped in sleep each wearied queen,"
19860,BOOK II.,"There as in sleep, the king was seen;"
19861,BOOK II.,And swift the troubling thought came o'er
19862,BOOK II.,Their spirits that he breathed no more.
19863,BOOK II.,At once with wailing loud and high
19864,BOOK II.,"The matrons shrieked a bitter cry,"
19865,BOOK II.,As widowed elephants bewail
19866,BOOK II.,Their dead lord in the woody vale.
19867,BOOK II.,"At the loud shriek that round them rang,"
19868,BOOK II.,Kausalyá and Sumitrá sprang
19869,BOOK II.,"Awakened from their beds, with eyes"
19870,BOOK II.,Wide open in their first surprise.
19871,BOOK II.,"Quick to the monarch's side they came,"
19872,BOOK II.,And saw and touched his lifeless frame;
19873,BOOK II.,"One cry, O husband! forth they sent,"
19874,BOOK II.,And prostrate to the ground they went.
19875,BOOK II.,The king of Kosal's daughter(338) there
19876,BOOK II.,"Writhed, with the dust on limb and hair"
19877,BOOK II.,"Lustreless, as a star might lie"
19878,BOOK II.,Hurled downward from the glorious sky.
19879,BOOK II.,"When the king's voice in death was stilled,"
19880,BOOK II.,The women who the chamber filled
19881,BOOK II.,"Saw, like a widow elephant slain,"
19882,BOOK II.,Kausalyá prostrate in her pain.
19883,BOOK II.,Then all the monarch's ladies led
19884,BOOK II.,"By Queen Kaikeyí at their head,"
19885,BOOK II.,"Poured forth their tears, and weeping so,"
19886,BOOK II.,"Sank on the ground, consumed by woe."
19887,BOOK II.,The cry of grief so long and loud
19888,BOOK II.,"Went up from all the royal crowd,"
19889,BOOK II.,"That, doubled by the matron train,"
19890,BOOK II.,It made the palace ring again.
19891,BOOK II.,"Filled with dark fear and eager eyes,"
19892,BOOK II.,Anxiety and wild surmise;
19893,BOOK II.,Echoing with the cries of grief
19894,BOOK II.,"Of sorrowing friends who mourned their chief,"
19895,BOOK II.,"Dejected, pale with deep distress,"
19896,BOOK II.,Hurled from their height of happiness:
19897,BOOK II.,Such was the look the palace wore
19898,BOOK II.,Where lay the king who breathed no more.

19912,BOOK II.,Then on her lap she laid his head.
19913,BOOK II.,And on Kaikeyí looked and said:
19914,BOOK II.,"""Triumphant now enjoy thy reign"
19915,BOOK II.,Without a thorn thy side to pain.
19916,BOOK II.,"Thou hast pursued thy single aim,"

19928,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí, through a hump-back maid,"
19929,BOOK II.,This royal house in death has laid.
19930,BOOK II.,"King Janak, with his queen, will hear"

19943,BOOK II.,"The cries of beast and bird will hear,"
19944,BOOK II.,And trembling in her wild alarm
19945,BOOK II.,Will cling to Ráma's sheltering arm.

19957,BOOK II.,Till chamberlains removed her thence
19958,BOOK II.,O'ercome by sorrow's violence.
19959,BOOK II.,Then in a cask of oil they laid

20216,BOOK II.,They reached at length Sudáman's hill:
20217,BOOK II.,"There Vishnu's footstep turned to see,"
20218,BOOK II.,"Vipásá(346) viewed, and Sálmalí,"

20240,BOOK II.,The night those messengers of state
20241,BOOK II.,"Had past within the city's gate,"
20242,BOOK II.,In dreams the slumbering Bharat saw
20243,BOOK II.,A sight that chilled his soul with awe.
20244,BOOK II.,The dream that dire events foretold
20245,BOOK II.,"Left Bharat's heart with horror cold,"
20246,BOOK II.,"And with consuming woes distraught,"
20247,BOOK II.,Upon his aged sire he thought.
20248,BOOK II.,"His dear companions, swift to trace"
20249,BOOK II.,"The signs of anguish on his face,"
20250,BOOK II.,"Drew near, his sorrow to expel,"
20251,BOOK II.,And pleasant tales began to tell.
20252,BOOK II.,"Some woke sweet music's cheering sound,"
20253,BOOK II.,And others danced in lively round.
20254,BOOK II.,With joke and jest they strove to raise
20255,BOOK II.,"His spirits, quoting ancient plays;"
20256,BOOK II.,"But Bharat still, the lofty-souled,"
20257,BOOK II.,"Deaf to sweet tales his fellows told,"
20258,BOOK II.,"Unmoved by music, dance, and jest,"
20259,BOOK II.,"Sat silent, by his woe oppressed."
20260,BOOK II.,"To him, begirt by comrades near,"
20261,BOOK II.,Thus spoke the friend he held most dear:
20262,BOOK II.,"""Why ringed around by friends, art thou"
20263,BOOK II.,"So silent and so mournful now?"""
20264,BOOK II.,"""Hear thou,"" thus Bharat made reply,"
20265,BOOK II.,"""What chills my heart and dims mine eye."
20266,BOOK II.,I dreamt I saw the king my sire
20267,BOOK II.,Sink headlong in a lake of mire
20268,BOOK II.,"Down from a mountain high in air,"
20269,BOOK II.,"His body soiled, and loose his hair."
20270,BOOK II.,Upon the miry lake he seemed
20271,BOOK II.,"To lie and welter, as I dreamed;"
20272,BOOK II.,With hollowed hands full many a draught
20273,BOOK II.,"Of oil he took, and loudly laughed."
20274,BOOK II.,With head cast down I saw him make
20275,BOOK II.,A meal on sesamum and cake;
20276,BOOK II.,"The oil from every member dripped,"
20277,BOOK II.,And in its clammy flood he dipped.
20278,BOOK II.,"The ocean's bed was bare and dry,"
20279,BOOK II.,"The moon had fallen from the sky,"
20280,BOOK II.,"And all the world lay still and dead,"
20281,BOOK II.,With whelming darkness overspread.
20282,BOOK II.,"The earth was rent and opened wide,"
20283,BOOK II.,"The leafy trees were scorched, and died;"
20284,BOOK II.,"I saw the seated mountains split,"
20285,BOOK II.,And wreaths of rising smoke emit.
20286,BOOK II.,The stately beast the monarch rode
20287,BOOK II.,His long tusks rent and splintered showed;
20288,BOOK II.,And flames that quenched and cold had lain
20289,BOOK II.,Blazed forth with kindled light again.
20290,BOOK II.,"I looked, and many a handsome dame,"
20291,BOOK II.,Arrayed in brown and sable came
20292,BOOK II.,"And bore about the monarch, dressed,"
20293,BOOK II.,"On iron stool, in sable vest."
20294,BOOK II.,"And then the king, of virtuous mind,"
20295,BOOK II.,"A blood-red wreath around him twined,"
20296,BOOK II.,"Forth on an ass-drawn chariot sped,"
20297,BOOK II.,As southward still he bent his head.
20298,BOOK II.,"Then, crimson-clad, a dame appeared"
20299,BOOK II.,Who at the monarch laughed and jeered;
20300,BOOK II.,"And a she-monster, dire to view,"
20301,BOOK II.,Her hand upon his body threw.
20302,BOOK II.,"Such is the dream I dreamt by night,"
20303,BOOK II.,Which chills me yet with wild affright:
20304,BOOK II.,"Either the king or Ráma, I"
20305,BOOK II.,Or Lakshman now must surely die.
20306,BOOK II.,For when an ass-drawn chariot seems
20307,BOOK II.,"To bear away a man in dreams,"

20309,BOOK II.,The smoke soon rears its cloudy spire.
20310,BOOK II.,"This makes my spirit low and weak,"
20311,BOOK II.,My tongue is slow and loth to speak:
20312,BOOK II.,"My lips and throat are dry for dread,"
20313,BOOK II.,And all my soul disquieted.
20314,BOOK II.,"My lips, relaxed, can hardly speak,"
20315,BOOK II.,And chilling dread has changed my cheek
20316,BOOK II.,"I blame myself in aimless fears,"
20317,BOOK II.,And still no cause of blame appears.
20318,BOOK II.,I dwell upon this dream of ill
20319,BOOK II.,"Whose changing scenes I viewed,"
20320,BOOK II.,And on the startling horror still
20321,BOOK II.,My troubled thoughts will brood.
20322,BOOK II.,"Still to my soul these terrors cling,"

20386,BOOK II.,"Thus Bharat, son of him who swayed"
20387,BOOK II.,"Ayodhyás realm, his answer made,"
20388,BOOK II.,"And then bespoke, his heart to please,"

20499,BOOK II.,"At Ansudhána Gangá, hard"
20500,BOOK II.,"To cross, his onward journey barred,"
20501,BOOK II.,So turning quickly thence he came
20502,BOOK II.,To Prágvat's city dear to fame.
20503,BOOK II.,There having gained the farther side
20504,BOOK II.,To Kutikoshtiká he hied:
20505,BOOK II.,"The stream he crossed, and onward then"
20506,BOOK II.,To Dharmavardhan brought his men.
20507,BOOK II.,"Thence, leaving Toran on the north,"
20508,BOOK II.,To Jambuprastha journeyed forth.
20509,BOOK II.,Then onward to a pleasant grove
20510,BOOK II.,"By fair Varútha's town he drove,"
20511,BOOK II.,"And when a while he there had stayed,"
20512,BOOK II.,Went eastward from the friendly shade.
20513,BOOK II.,Eastward of Ujjiháná where
20514,BOOK II.,"The Priyak trees are tall and fair,"
20515,BOOK II.,"He passed, and rested there each steed"
20516,BOOK II.,Exhausted with the journey's speed.
20517,BOOK II.,"There orders to his men addressed,"
20518,BOOK II.,"With quickened pace he onward pressed,"
20519,BOOK II.,"A while at Sarvatírtha spent,"
20520,BOOK II.,Then o'er Uttániká he went.
20521,BOOK II.,O'er many a stream beside he sped
20522,BOOK II.,"With coursers on the mountains bred,"
20523,BOOK II.,"And passing Hastiprishthak, took"
20524,BOOK II.,The road o'er Kutiká's fair brook.
20525,BOOK II.,"Then, at Lohitya's village, he"
20526,BOOK II.,"Crossed o'er the swift Kapívatí,"
20527,BOOK II.,"Then passed, where Ekasála stands,"
20528,BOOK II.,"The Sthánumatí's flood and sands,"
20529,BOOK II.,And Gomatí of fair renown
20530,BOOK II.,By Vinata's delightful town.
20531,BOOK II.,"When to Kalinga near he drew,"
20532,BOOK II.,A wood of Sal trees charmed the view;
20533,BOOK II.,"That passed, the sun began to rise,"
20534,BOOK II.,"And Bharat saw with happy eyes,"
20535,BOOK II.,"Ayodhyá's city, built and planned"
20536,BOOK II.,By ancient Manu's royal hand.
20537,BOOK II.,"Seven nights upon the road had passed,"
20538,BOOK II.,And when he saw the town at last
20539,BOOK II.,"Before him in her beauty spread,"
20540,BOOK II.,Thus Bharat to the driver said:
20541,BOOK II.,"""This glorious city from afar,"
20542,BOOK II.,"Wherein pure groves and gardens are,"
20543,BOOK II.,Seems to my eager eyes to-day
20544,BOOK II.,A lifeless pile of yellow clay.
20545,BOOK II.,Through all her streets where erst a throng
20546,BOOK II.,"Of men and women streamed along,"
20547,BOOK II.,Uprose the multitudinous roar:
20548,BOOK II.,To-day I hear that sound no more.
20549,BOOK II.,No longer do mine eyes behold
20550,BOOK II.,"The leading people, as of old,"
20551,BOOK II.,"On elephants, cars, horses, go"
20552,BOOK II.,"Abroad and homeward, to and fro."
20553,BOOK II.,"The brilliant gardens, where we heard"
20554,BOOK II.,"The wild note of each rapturous bird,"
20555,BOOK II.,"Where men and women loved to meet,"
20556,BOOK II.,"In pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,--"
20557,BOOK II.,These to my eyes this day appear
20558,BOOK II.,"Joyless, and desolate, and drear:"
20559,BOOK II.,"Each tree that graced the garden grieves,"
20560,BOOK II.,And every path is spread with leaves.
20561,BOOK II.,"The merry cry of bird and beast,"
20562,BOOK II.,"That spake aloud their joy, has ceased:"
20563,BOOK II.,Still is the long melodious note
20564,BOOK II.,That charmed us from each warbling throat.
20565,BOOK II.,"Why blows the blessed air no more,"
20566,BOOK II.,The incense-breathing air that bore
20567,BOOK II.,Its sweet incomparable scent
20568,BOOK II.,Of sandal and of aloe blent?
20569,BOOK II.,Why are the drum and tabour mute?
20570,BOOK II.,Why is the music of the lute
20571,BOOK II.,"That woke responsive to the quill,"
20572,BOOK II.,"Loved by the happy, hushed and still?"
20573,BOOK II.,My boding spirit gathers hence
20574,BOOK II.,"Dire sins of awful consequence,"
20575,BOOK II.,"And omens, crowding on my sight,"
20576,BOOK II.,Weigh down my soul with wild affright.
20577,BOOK II.,Scarce shall I find my friends who dwell
20578,BOOK II.,Here in Ayodhyá safe and well:
20579,BOOK II.,For surely not without a cause

20581,BOOK II.,
20582,BOOK II.,"Heart sick, dejected, every sense"
20583,BOOK II.,"Confused by terror's influence,"
20584,BOOK II.,On to the town he quickly swept
20585,BOOK II.,Which King Ikshváku's children kept.
20586,BOOK II.,"He passed through Vaijayanta's gate,"
20587,BOOK II.,"With weary steeds, disconsolate,"
20588,BOOK II.,"And all who near their station held,"
20589,BOOK II.,"His escort, crying Victory, swelled,"
20590,BOOK II.,With heart distracted still he bowed
20591,BOOK II.,"Farewell to all the following crowd,"
20592,BOOK II.,Turned to the driver and began
20593,BOOK II.,To question thus the weary man:
20594,BOOK II.,"""Why was I brought, O free from blame,"
20595,BOOK II.,"So fast, unknown for what I came?"
20596,BOOK II.,"Yet fear of ill my heart appals,"
20597,BOOK II.,And all my wonted courage falls.
20598,BOOK II.,For I have heard in days gone by
20599,BOOK II.,The changes seen when monarchs die;
20600,BOOK II.,"And all those signs, O charioteer,"
20601,BOOK II.,I see to-day surround me here:
20602,BOOK II.,"Each kinsman's house looks dark and grim,"
20603,BOOK II.,No hand delights to keep it trim:
20604,BOOK II.,"The beauty vanished, and the pride,"
20605,BOOK II.,"The doors, unkept, stand open wide."
20606,BOOK II.,"No morning rites are offered there,"
20607,BOOK II.,"No grateful incense loads the air,"
20608,BOOK II.,"And all therein, with brows o'ercast,"
20609,BOOK II.,Sit joyless on the ground and fast.
20610,BOOK II.,"Their lovely chaplets dry and dead,"
20611,BOOK II.,"Their courts unswept, with dust o'erspread,"
20612,BOOK II.,The temples of the Gods to-day
20613,BOOK II.,No more look beautiful and gay.
20614,BOOK II.,"Neglected stands each holy shrine,"
20615,BOOK II.,Each image of a Lord divine.
20616,BOOK II.,No shop where flowery wreaths are sold
20617,BOOK II.,Is bright and busy as of old.
20618,BOOK II.,The women and the men I mark
20619,BOOK II.,"Absorbed in fancies dull and dark,"
20620,BOOK II.,"Their gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,"
20621,BOOK II.,"A poor afflicted multitude."""
20622,BOOK II.,
20623,BOOK II.,"His mind oppressed with woe and dread,"

20638,BOOK II.,"She saw her son, so long away,"

20641,BOOK II.,Sprung forward to her darling boy.
20642,BOOK II.,"Within the bower, no longer bright,"
20643,BOOK II.,"Came Bharat lover of the right,"
20644,BOOK II.,And bending with observance sweet
20645,BOOK II.,Clasped his dear mother's lovely feet.
20646,BOOK II.,"Long kisses on his brow she pressed,"
20647,BOOK II.,"And held her hero to her breast,"
20648,BOOK II.,"Then fondly drew him to her knees,"
20649,BOOK II.,And questioned him in words like these:
20650,BOOK II.,"""How many nights have fled, since thou"
20651,BOOK II.,"Leftest thy grandsire's home, till now?"
20652,BOOK II.,"By flying steeds so swiftly borne,"
20653,BOOK II.,Art thou not weak and travel-worn?
20654,BOOK II.,"How fares the king my father, tell:"

20656,BOOK II.,"And now, my son, at length declare"
20657,BOOK II.,"The pleasure of the visit there."""
20658,BOOK II.,
20659,BOOK II.,Thus to the offspring of the king
20660,BOOK II.,"She spake with tender questioning,"
20661,BOOK II.,And to his mother made reply
20662,BOOK II.,Young Bharat of the lotus eye:
20663,BOOK II.,"""The seventh night has come and fled"

20666,BOOK II.,"Yudhájit, from all trouble free."
20667,BOOK II.,The gold and every precious thing
20668,BOOK II.,"Presented by the conqueror king,"
20669,BOOK II.,The slower guards behind convey:
20670,BOOK II.,I left them weary on the way.
20671,BOOK II.,"Urged by the men my father sent,"
20672,BOOK II.,My hasty course I hither bent:
20673,BOOK II.,"Now, I implore, an answer deign,"
20674,BOOK II.,"And all I wish to know, explain."
20675,BOOK II.,Unoccupied I now behold
20676,BOOK II.,"This couch of thine adorned with gold,"
20677,BOOK II.,And each of King Ikshváku's race
20678,BOOK II.,Appears with dark and gloomy face.
20679,BOOK II.,"The king is aye, my mother dear,"
20680,BOOK II.,Most constant in his visits here.
20681,BOOK II.,To meet my sire I sought this spot:

20706,BOOK II.,"By grief's intolerable weight,"
20707,BOOK II.,With every sense amazed and cowed
20708,BOOK II.,The splendid hero wailed aloud:
20709,BOOK II.,"""Ah me, my royal father's bed"
20710,BOOK II.,"Of old a gentle radiance shed,"
20711,BOOK II.,"Like the pure sky when clouds are past,"
20712,BOOK II.,And the moon's light is o'er it cast:
20713,BOOK II.,"Ah, of its wisest lord bereft,"
20714,BOOK II.,"It shows to-day faint radiance left,"

20723,BOOK II.,"Godlike, afflicted, in despair,"

20735,BOOK II.,"Long on the ground he wept, and rolled"

20738,BOOK II.,His mother with these words addressed:
20739,BOOK II.,"""This joyful hope my bosom fed"
20740,BOOK II.,When from my grandsire's halls I sped--
20741,BOOK II.,"""The king will throne his eldest son,"

20743,BOOK II.,"But all is changed, my hope was vain,"

20745,BOOK II.,"For my dear father's face I miss,"
20746,BOOK II.,Who ever sought his loved ones' bliss.
20747,BOOK II.,"But in my absence, mother, say,"
20748,BOOK II.,What sickness took my sire away?
20749,BOOK II.,"Ah, happy Ráma, happy they"

20751,BOOK II.,The glorious monarch has not learned
20752,BOOK II.,"That I his darling have returned,"
20753,BOOK II.,"Or quickly had he hither sped,"
20754,BOOK II.,And pressed his kisses on my head.
20755,BOOK II.,"Where is that hand whose gentle touch,"
20756,BOOK II.,"Most soft and kind I loved so much,"

20789,BOOK II.,"He heard, yet deeper in despair,"
20790,BOOK II.,"Her lips this double woe declare,"
20791,BOOK II.,And with sad brow that showed his pain
20792,BOOK II.,Questioned his mother thus again:
20793,BOOK II.,"""But where is he, of virtue tried,"
20794,BOOK II.,"Who fills Kausalyá's heart with pride,"

20797,BOOK II.,
20798,BOOK II.,"Thus pressed, the queen began to tell"

20800,BOOK II.,"And gave her son in words like these,"
20801,BOOK II.,The mournful news she meant to please:
20802,BOOK II.,"""The prince is gone in hermit dress"

20822,BOOK II.,"Deceitful-hearted, fond, and blind"
20823,BOOK II.,As is the way of womankind:
20824,BOOK II.,"""No Bráhman's wealth has Ráma seized,"

20828,BOOK II.,But when I heard the monarch planned
20829,BOOK II.,"To give the realm to Ráma's hand,"
20830,BOOK II.,"I prayed that Ráma hence might flee,"
20831,BOOK II.,"And claimed the throne, my son, for thee."

21314,BOOK II.,"When thou, my sire, hast sought the sky,"
21315,BOOK II.,And Ráma has been forced to fly?
21316,BOOK II.,"In widowed woe, bereft of thee,"
21317,BOOK II.,The land no more is fair to see:
21318,BOOK II.,"The city, to my aching sight,"
21319,BOOK II.,"Is gloomy as a moonless night."""
21320,BOOK II.,
21321,BOOK II.,"Thus, with o'erwhelming sorrow pained,"
21322,BOOK II.,Sad Bharat by the bed complained:
21323,BOOK II.,"And thus Vasishtha, holy sage,"
21324,BOOK II.,Spoke his deep anguish to assuage:
21325,BOOK II.,"""O Lord of men, no longer stay;"
21326,BOOK II.,The last remaining duties pay:
21327,BOOK II.,"Haste, mighty-armed, as I advise,"
21328,BOOK II.,"The funeral rites to solemnize."""
21329,BOOK II.,
21330,BOOK II.,And Bharat heard Vasishtha's rede
21331,BOOK II.,With due attention and agreed.
21332,BOOK II.,He summoned straight from every side
21333,BOOK II.,"Chaplain, and priest, and holy guide."
21334,BOOK II.,The sacred fires he bade them bring
21335,BOOK II.,"Forth from the chapel of the king,"
21336,BOOK II.,"Wherein the priests in order due,"
21337,BOOK II.,"And ministers, the offerings threw."
21338,BOOK II.,"Distraught in mind, with sob and tear,"
21339,BOOK II.,"They laid the body on a bier,"
21340,BOOK II.,"And servants, while their eyes brimmed o'er"
21341,BOOK II.,The monarch from the palace bore.
21342,BOOK II.,Another band of mourners led
21343,BOOK II.,The long procession of the dead:
21344,BOOK II.,"Rich garments in the way they cast,"
21345,BOOK II.,"And gold and silver, as they passed."
21346,BOOK II.,Then other hands the corse bedewed
21347,BOOK II.,With fragrant juices that exude
21348,BOOK II.,"From sandal, cedar, aloe, pine,"
21349,BOOK II.,And every perfume rare and fine.
21350,BOOK II.,Then priestly hands the mighty dead
21351,BOOK II.,Upon the pyre deposited.
21352,BOOK II.,"The sacred fires they tended next,"
21353,BOOK II.,And muttered low each funeral text;
21354,BOOK II.,And priestly singers who rehearse
21355,BOOK II.,The Saman(352) sang their holy verse.
21356,BOOK II.,"Forth from the town in litters came,"
21357,BOOK II.,"Or chariots, many a royal dame,"
21358,BOOK II.,"And honoured so the funeral ground,"
21359,BOOK II.,With aged followers ringed around.
21360,BOOK II.,"With steps in inverse order bent,(353)"
21361,BOOK II.,The priests in sad procession went
21362,BOOK II.,Around the monarch's burning pyre
21363,BOOK II.,Who well had nursed each sacred fire:
21364,BOOK II.,"With Queen Kausalyá and the rest,"
21365,BOOK II.,Their tender hearts with woe distressed.
21366,BOOK II.,"The voice of women, shrill and clear"
21367,BOOK II.,"As screaming curlews, smote the ear,"
21368,BOOK II.,As from a thousand voices rose
21369,BOOK II.,The shriek that tells of woman's woes.
21370,BOOK II.,"Then weeping, faint, with loud lament,"
21371,BOOK II.,Down Sarjú's shelving bank they went.
21372,BOOK II.,There standing on the river side
21373,BOOK II.,"With Bharat, priest, and peer,"
21374,BOOK II.,Their lips the women purified
21375,BOOK II.,With water fresh and clear.
21376,BOOK II.,"Returning to the royal town,"
21377,BOOK II.,"Their eyes with tear-drops filled,"
21378,BOOK II.,"Ten days on earth they laid them down,"
21379,BOOK II.,And wept till grief was stilled.

21385,BOOK II.,
21386,BOOK II.,
21387,BOOK II.,The tenth day passed: the prince again
21388,BOOK II.,Was free from every legal stain.
21389,BOOK II.,He bade them on the twelfth the great
21390,BOOK II.,Remaining honour celebrate.
21391,BOOK II.,"Much gold he gave, and gems, and food,"
21392,BOOK II.,"To all the Bráhman multitude,"
21393,BOOK II.,"And goats whose hair was white and fine,"
21394,BOOK II.,And many a thousand head of kine:
21395,BOOK II.,"Slaves, men and damsels, he bestowed,"
21396,BOOK II.,And many a car and fair abode:
21397,BOOK II.,Such gifts he gave the Bráhman race
21398,BOOK II.,His father's obsequies to grace.
21399,BOOK II.,Then when the morning's earliest ray
21400,BOOK II.,"Appeared upon the thirteenth day,"
21401,BOOK II.,Again the hero wept and sighed
21402,BOOK II.,Distraught and sorrow-stupefied;
21403,BOOK II.,"Drew, sobbing in his anguish, near,"
21404,BOOK II.,"The last remaining debt to clear,"
21405,BOOK II.,"And at the bottom of the pyre,"
21406,BOOK II.,He thus bespake his royal sire:
21407,BOOK II.,"""O father, hast thou left me so,"
21408,BOOK II.,"Deserted in my friendless woe,"
21409,BOOK II.,When he to whom the charge was given
21410,BOOK II.,"To keep me, to the wood is driven?"
21411,BOOK II.,Her only son is forced away
21412,BOOK II.,Who was his helpless mother's stay:
21413,BOOK II.,"Ah, whither, father, art thou fled;"
21414,BOOK II.,"Leaving the queen uncomforted?"""
21415,BOOK II.,
21416,BOOK II.,He looked upon the pile where lay
21417,BOOK II.,"The bones half-burnt and ashes grey,"
21418,BOOK II.,"And uttering a piteous moan,"
21419,BOOK II.,"Gave way, by anguish overthrown."
21420,BOOK II.,"Then as his tears began to well,"
21421,BOOK II.,Prostrate to earth the hero fell;
21422,BOOK II.,"So from its seat the staff they drag,"
21423,BOOK II.,And cast to earth some glorious flag.
21424,BOOK II.,The ministers approached again
21425,BOOK II.,The prince whom rites had freed from stain;
21426,BOOK II.,"So when Yayáti fell, each seer,"
21427,BOOK II.,"In pity for his fate, drew near."
21428,BOOK II.,Satrughna saw him lying low
21429,BOOK II.,"O'erwhelmed beneath the crush of woe,"
21430,BOOK II.,"And as upon the king he thought,"
21431,BOOK II.,He fell upon the earth distraught.
21432,BOOK II.,When to his loving memory came
21433,BOOK II.,"Those noble gifts, that kingly frame,"
21434,BOOK II.,"He sorrowed, by his woe distressed,"
21435,BOOK II.,As one by frenzied rage possessed:
21436,BOOK II.,"""Ah me, this surging sea of woe"
21437,BOOK II.,Has drowned us with its overflow:
21438,BOOK II.,"The source is Manthará, dire and dark,"
21439,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí is the ravening shark:
21440,BOOK II.,And the great boons the monarch gave
21441,BOOK II.,Lend conquering might to every wave.
21442,BOOK II.,"Ah, whither wilt thou go, and leave"
21443,BOOK II.,"Thy Bharat in his woe to grieve,"
21444,BOOK II.,Whom ever 'twas thy greatest joy
21445,BOOK II.,To fondle as a tender boy?
21446,BOOK II.,Didst thou not give with thoughtful care
21447,BOOK II.,"Our food, our drink, our robes to wear?"
21448,BOOK II.,"Whose love will now for us provide,"
21449,BOOK II.,"When thou, our king and sire, hast died?"
21450,BOOK II.,"At such a time bereft, forlorn,"
21451,BOOK II.,"Why is not earth in sunder torn,"
21452,BOOK II.,"Missing her monarch's firm control,"
21453,BOOK II.,"His love of right, his lofty soul?"

21455,BOOK II.,My sire is where the Blessed are;
21456,BOOK II.,How can I live deserted? I
21457,BOOK II.,Will pass into the fire and die.
21458,BOOK II.,"Abandoned thus, I will not brook"
21459,BOOK II.,"Upon Ayodhyá's town to look,"
21460,BOOK II.,Once guarded by Ikshváku's race:
21461,BOOK II.,"The wood shall be my dwelling place."""
21462,BOOK II.,
21463,BOOK II.,Then when the princes' mournful train
21464,BOOK II.,"Heard the sad brothers thus complain,"
21465,BOOK II.,"And saw their misery, at the view"
21466,BOOK II.,Their grief burst wilder out anew.
21467,BOOK II.,"Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,"
21468,BOOK II.,"Each like a bull with broken horn,"
21469,BOOK II.,The brothers in their wild despair
21470,BOOK II.,"Lay rolling, mad with misery, there."
21471,BOOK II.,"Then old Vasishtha good and true,"
21472,BOOK II.,"Their father's priest, all lore who knew,"
21473,BOOK II.,"Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,"
21474,BOOK II.,And thus bespake with counsel meet:
21475,BOOK II.,"""Twelve days, my lord, have past away"
21476,BOOK II.,Since flames consumed thy father's clay:
21477,BOOK II.,"Delay no more: as rules ordain,"
21478,BOOK II.,Gather what bones may yet remain.
21479,BOOK II.,Three constant pairs are ever found

21488,BOOK II.,"When rose each hero from the ground,"
21489,BOOK II.,"A lion lord of men, renowned,"
21490,BOOK II.,"He showed like Indra's flag,(355) whereon"
21491,BOOK II.,Fierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.
21492,BOOK II.,"They wiped their red and weeping eyes,"
21493,BOOK II.,And gently made their sad replies:

21511,BOOK II.,"Could not his arm the king restrain,"
21512,BOOK II.,Or make the banished free again?
21513,BOOK II.,One loving right and fearing crime

21518,BOOK II.,"While Lakshman's younger brother, dread"
21519,BOOK II.,"Satrughna, thus to Bharat said,"
21520,BOOK II.,"Came to the fronting door, arrayed"
21521,BOOK II.,"In glittering robes, the hump-back maid."
21522,BOOK II.,"There she, with sandal-oil besmeared,"
21523,BOOK II.,In garments meet for queens appeared:
21524,BOOK II.,And lustre to her form was lent
21525,BOOK II.,By many a gem and ornament.
21526,BOOK II.,"She girdled with her broidered zone,"
21527,BOOK II.,"And many a chain about her thrown,"
21528,BOOK II.,Showed like a female monkey round
21529,BOOK II.,Whose body many a string is bound.
21530,BOOK II.,When on that cause of evil fell
21531,BOOK II.,"The quick eye of the sentinel,"
21532,BOOK II.,"He grasped her in his ruthless hold,"
21533,BOOK II.,"And hastening in, Satrughna told:"
21534,BOOK II.,"""Here is the wicked pest,"" he cried,"
21535,BOOK II.,"""Through whom the king thy father died,"
21536,BOOK II.,And Ráma wanders in the wood:

21538,BOOK II.,The warder spoke: and every word
21539,BOOK II.,Satrughna's breast to fury stirred:
21540,BOOK II.,"He called the servants, all and each."
21541,BOOK II.,And spake in wrath his hasty speech:
21542,BOOK II.,"""This is the wretch my sire who slew,"
21543,BOOK II.,And misery on my brothers drew:
21544,BOOK II.,"Let her this day obtain the meed,"
21545,BOOK II.,"Vile sinner, of her cruel deed."""

21547,BOOK II.,"His mighty hand upon the maid,"
21548,BOOK II.,"Who as her fellows ringed her round,"

21552,BOOK II.,"Their hearts disturbed by sudden dread,"
21553,BOOK II.,They turned and from his presence fled.
21554,BOOK II.,"""His rage,"" they cried, ""on us will fall,"
21555,BOOK II.,"And ruthless, he will slay us all."

21565,BOOK II.,This way and that with no remorse
21566,BOOK II.,"He dragged her with resistless force,"
21567,BOOK II.,And chains and glittering trinkets burst
21568,BOOK II.,"Lay here and there with gems dispersed,"

21571,BOOK II.,"The lord of men, supremely strong,"

21575,BOOK II.,Deep in her heart Kaikeyí felt
21576,BOOK II.,"The stabs his keen reproaches dealt,"
21577,BOOK II.,"And of Satrughna's ire afraid,"
21578,BOOK II.,To Bharat flew and cried for aid.
21579,BOOK II.,He looked and saw the prince inflamed
21580,BOOK II.,"With burning rage, and thus exclaimed:"
21581,BOOK II.,"""Forgive! thine angry arm restrain:"
21582,BOOK II.,A woman never may be slain.
21583,BOOK II.,"My hand Kaikeyí's blood would spill,"

21595,BOOK II.,The trembling wretch with terror faint.
21596,BOOK II.,"Then to Kaikeyí's feet she crept,"
21597,BOOK II.,And prostrate in her misery wept.
21598,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí on the hump-back gazed,"
21599,BOOK II.,And saw her weep and gasp.
21600,BOOK II.,"Still quivering, with her senses dazed,"

21637,BOOK II.,Thus to the gathered people spake:
21638,BOOK II.,"""The eldest son is ever king:"

21648,BOOK II.,For I will follow on his track
21649,BOOK II.,And bring my eldest brother back.
21650,BOOK II.,Whate'er the rites of throning need
21651,BOOK II.,Placed on a car the way shall lead:
21652,BOOK II.,The sacred vessels I will take
21653,BOOK II.,To the wild wood for Ráma's sake.
21654,BOOK II.,I o'er the lion prince's head
21655,BOOK II.,"The sanctifying balm will shed,"
21656,BOOK II.,"And bring him, as the fire they bring"

21728,BOOK II.,With ocean's boundless waters vied.
21729,BOOK II.,In dry and thirsty spots they sank
21730,BOOK II.,"Full many a well and ample tank,"
21731,BOOK II.,And altars round about them placed
21732,BOOK II.,To deck the station in the waste.
21733,BOOK II.,"With well-wrought plaster smoothly spread,"
21734,BOOK II.,"With bloomy trees that rose o'erhead,"
21735,BOOK II.,"With banners waving in the air,"
21736,BOOK II.,"And wild birds singing here and there,"
21737,BOOK II.,"With fragrant sandal-water wet,"
21738,BOOK II.,"With many a flower beside it set,"
21739,BOOK II.,Like the Gods' heavenly pathway showed
21740,BOOK II.,That mighty host's imperial road.
21741,BOOK II.,"Deft workmen, chosen for their skill"
21742,BOOK II.,"To do the high-souled Bharat's will,"
21743,BOOK II.,In every pleasant spot where grew
21744,BOOK II.,"Trees of sweet fruit and fair to view,"
21745,BOOK II.,"As he commanded, toiled to grace"
21746,BOOK II.,With all delights his camping-place.
21747,BOOK II.,"And they who read the stars, and well"
21748,BOOK II.,"Each lucky sign and hour could tell,"
21749,BOOK II.,Raised carefully the tented shade
21750,BOOK II.,Wherein high-minded Bharat stayed.
21751,BOOK II.,"With ample space of level ground,"
21752,BOOK II.,With broad deep moat encompassed round;
21753,BOOK II.,"Like Mandar in his towering pride,"
21754,BOOK II.,With streets that ran from side to side;
21755,BOOK II.,Enwreathed with many a palace tall
21756,BOOK II.,Surrounded by its noble wall;
21757,BOOK II.,"With roads by skilful workmen made,"
21758,BOOK II.,Where many a glorious banner played;
21759,BOOK II.,"With stately mansions, where the dove"
21760,BOOK II.,Sat nestling in her cote above.
21761,BOOK II.,Rising aloft supremely fair
21762,BOOK II.,"Like heavenly cars that float in air,"
21763,BOOK II.,Each camp in beauty and in bliss
21764,BOOK II.,Matched Indra's own metropolis.
21765,BOOK II.,"As shines the heaven on some fair night,"
21766,BOOK II.,"With moon and constellations filled,"
21767,BOOK II.,"The prince's royal road was bright,"
21768,BOOK II.,Adorned by art of workmen skilled.

21772,BOOK II.,
21773,BOOK II.,Canto LXXXI. The Assembly.
21774,BOOK II.,
21775,BOOK II.,
21776,BOOK II.,Ere yet the dawn had ushered in
21777,BOOK II.,"The day should see the march begin,"
21778,BOOK II.,Herald and bard who rightly knew
21779,BOOK II.,"Each nice degree of honour due,"
21780,BOOK II.,"Their loud auspicious voices raised,"
21781,BOOK II.,And royal Bharat blessed and praised.
21782,BOOK II.,"With sticks of gold the drum they smote,"
21783,BOOK II.,"Which thundered out its deafening note,"
21784,BOOK II.,"Blew loud the sounding shell, and blent"
21785,BOOK II.,Each high and low-toned instrument.
21786,BOOK II.,The mingled sound of drum and horn
21787,BOOK II.,"Through all the air was quickly borne,"
21788,BOOK II.,"And as in Bharat's ear it rang,"
21789,BOOK II.,Gave the sad prince another pang.
21790,BOOK II.,
21791,BOOK II.,"Then Bharat, starting from repose,"
21792,BOOK II.,"Stilled the glad sounds that round him rose,"
21793,BOOK II.,"""I am not king; no more mistake:"""
21794,BOOK II.,Then to Satrughna thus he spake:
21795,BOOK II.,"""O see what general wrongs succeed"
21796,BOOK II.,Sprung from Kaikeyí's evil deed!
21797,BOOK II.,The king my sire has died and thrown
21798,BOOK II.,Fresh miseries on me alone.
21799,BOOK II.,"The royal bliss, on duty based,"
21800,BOOK II.,"Which our just high-souled father graced,"
21801,BOOK II.,Wanders in doubt and sore distress
21802,BOOK II.,Like a tossed vessel rudderless.
21803,BOOK II.,And he who was our lordly stay
21804,BOOK II.,"Roams in the forest far away,"
21805,BOOK II.,"Expelled by this my mother, who"
21806,BOOK II.,"To duty's law is most untrue."""
21807,BOOK II.,
21808,BOOK II.,As royal Bharat thus gave vent
21809,BOOK II.,"To bitter grief in wild lament,"
21810,BOOK II.,Gazing upon his face the crowd
21811,BOOK II.,Of pitying women wept aloud.
21812,BOOK II.,"His lamentation scarce was o'er,"
21813,BOOK II.,"When Saint Vasishtha, skilled in lore"
21814,BOOK II.,"Of royal duty, dear to fame,"
21815,BOOK II.,To join the great assembly came.
21816,BOOK II.,Girt by disciples ever true
21817,BOOK II.,"Still nearer to that hall he drew,"
21818,BOOK II.,"Resplendent, heavenly to behold,"
21819,BOOK II.,Adorned with wealth of gems and gold:
21820,BOOK II.,E'en so a man in duty tried
21821,BOOK II.,Draws near to meet his virtuous bride.
21822,BOOK II.,He reached his golden seat o'erlaid
21823,BOOK II.,"With coverlet of rich brocade,"
21824,BOOK II.,"There sat, in all the Vedas read,"
21825,BOOK II.,"And called the messengers, and said:"
21826,BOOK II.,"""Go forth, let Bráhman, Warrior, peer,"
21827,BOOK II.,And every captain gather here:
21828,BOOK II.,Let all attentive hither throng:
21829,BOOK II.,"Go, hasten: we delay too long."
21830,BOOK II.,"Satrughna, glorious Bharat bring,"
21831,BOOK II.,"The noble children of the king,(357)"
21832,BOOK II.,"Yudhájit(358) and Sumantra, all"
21833,BOOK II.,"The truthful and the virtuous call."""
21834,BOOK II.,
21835,BOOK II.,He ended: soon a mighty sound
21836,BOOK II.,"Of thickening tumult rose around,"
21837,BOOK II.,As to the hall they bent their course
21838,BOOK II.,"With car, and elephant, and horse,"
21839,BOOK II.,The people all with glad acclaim
21840,BOOK II.,Welcomed Prince Bharat as he came:
21841,BOOK II.,"E'en as they loved their king to greet,"
21842,BOOK II.,Or as the Gods Lord Indra(359) meet.
21843,BOOK II.,The vast assembly shone as fair
21844,BOOK II.,With Bharat's kingly face
21845,BOOK II.,As Dasaratha's self were there
21846,BOOK II.,To glorify the place.
21847,BOOK II.,It gleamed like some unruffled lake
21848,BOOK II.,Where monsters huge of mould
21849,BOOK II.,With many a snake their pastime take
21850,BOOK II.,"O'er shells, sand, gems, and gold."

21856,BOOK II.,
21857,BOOK II.,
21858,BOOK II.,The prudent prince the assembly viewed
21859,BOOK II.,"Thronged with its noble multitude,"
21860,BOOK II.,Resplendent as a cloudless night
21861,BOOK II.,When the full moon is in his height;
21862,BOOK II.,While robes of every varied hue
21863,BOOK II.,A glory o'er the synod threw.
21864,BOOK II.,The priest in lore of duty skilled
21865,BOOK II.,"Looked on the crowd the hall that filled,"
21866,BOOK II.,And then in accents soft and grave
21867,BOOK II.,To Bharat thus his counsel gave:
21868,BOOK II.,"""The king, dear son, so good and wise,"
21869,BOOK II.,"Has gone from earth and gained the skies,"
21870,BOOK II.,"Leaving to thee, her rightful lord,"
21871,BOOK II.,This rich wide land with foison stored.
21872,BOOK II.,And still has faithful Ráma stood
21873,BOOK II.,"Firm to the duty of the good,"
21874,BOOK II.,"And kept his father's hest aright,"
21875,BOOK II.,As the moon keeps its own dear light.
21876,BOOK II.,Thus sire and brother yield to thee
21877,BOOK II.,This realm from all annoyance free:
21878,BOOK II.,Rejoice thy lords: enjoy thine own:
21879,BOOK II.,"Anointed king, ascend the throne."
21880,BOOK II.,Let vassal Princes hasten forth
21881,BOOK II.,"From distant lands, west, south, and north,"
21882,BOOK II.,"From Kerala,(360) from every sea,"
21883,BOOK II.,"And bring ten million gems to thee."""
21884,BOOK II.,"As thus the sage Vasishtha spoke,"
21885,BOOK II.,A storm of grief o'er Bharat broke.
21886,BOOK II.,"And longing to be just and true,"
21887,BOOK II.,His thoughts to duteous Ráma flew.
21888,BOOK II.,"With sobs and sighs and broken tones,"
21889,BOOK II.,"E'en as a wounded mallard moans,"
21890,BOOK II.,"He mourned with deepest sorrow moved,"
21891,BOOK II.,And thus the holy priest reproved:
21892,BOOK II.,"""O, how can such as Bharat dare"
21893,BOOK II.,"The power and sway from him to tear,"
21894,BOOK II.,"Wise, and devout, and true, and chaste,"
21895,BOOK II.,With Scripture lore and virtue graced?
21896,BOOK II.,Can one of Dasaratha's seed
21897,BOOK II.,Be guilty of so vile a deed?
21898,BOOK II.,"The realm and I are Ráma's: thou,"
21899,BOOK II.,Shouldst speak the words of justice now.
21900,BOOK II.,"For he, to claims of virtue true,"
21901,BOOK II.,Is eldest born and noblest too:
21902,BOOK II.,"Nahush, Dilípa could not be"
21903,BOOK II.,More famous in their lives than he.
21904,BOOK II.,"As Dasaratha ruled of right,"
21905,BOOK II.,So Ráma's is the power and right.
21906,BOOK II.,If I should do this sinful deed
21907,BOOK II.,"And forfeit hope of heavenly meed,"
21908,BOOK II.,My guilty act would dim the shine
21909,BOOK II.,Of old Ikshváku's glorious line.
21910,BOOK II.,"Nay, as the sin my mother wrought"
21911,BOOK II.,"Is grievous to my inmost thought,"
21912,BOOK II.,"I here, my hands together laid,"
21913,BOOK II.,Will greet him in the pathless shade.
21914,BOOK II.,"To Ráma shall my steps be bent,"
21915,BOOK II.,"My King, of men most excellent,"
21916,BOOK II.,"Raghu's illustrious son, whose sway"
21917,BOOK II.,"Might hell, and earth, and heaven obey."""
21918,BOOK II.,
21919,BOOK II.,"That righteous speech, whose every word"
21920,BOOK II.,"Bore virtue's stamp, the audience heard;"
21921,BOOK II.,"On Ráma every thought was set,"
21922,BOOK II.,And with glad tears each eye was wet.
21923,BOOK II.,"""Then, if the power I still should lack"
21924,BOOK II.,"To bring my noble brother back,"
21925,BOOK II.,"I in the wood will dwell, and share"
21926,BOOK II.,His banishment with Lakshman there.
21927,BOOK II.,By every art persuasive I
21928,BOOK II.,"To bring him from the wood will try,"
21929,BOOK II.,"And show him to your loving eyes,"
21930,BOOK II.,"O Bráhmans noble, good, and wise."
21931,BOOK II.,"E'en now, the road to make and clear,"
21932,BOOK II.,"Each labourer pressed, and pioneer"
21933,BOOK II.,Have I sent forward to precede
21934,BOOK II.,"The army I resolve to lead."""
21935,BOOK II.,
21936,BOOK II.,"Thus, by fraternal love possessed,"
21937,BOOK II.,"His firm resolve the prince expressed,"
21938,BOOK II.,"Then to Sumantra, deeply read"
21939,BOOK II.,"In holy texts, he turned and said:"
21940,BOOK II.,"""Sumantra, rise without delay,"
21941,BOOK II.,And as I bid my words obey.
21942,BOOK II.,"Give orders for the march with speed,"
21943,BOOK II.,"And all the army hither lead."""
21944,BOOK II.,
21945,BOOK II.,"The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,"
21946,BOOK II.,Obeyed the high-souled chief's behest.
21947,BOOK II.,He hurried forth with joy inspired
21948,BOOK II.,And gave the orders he desired.
21949,BOOK II.,"Delight each soldier's bosom filled,"
21950,BOOK II.,"And through each chief and captain thrilled,"
21951,BOOK II.,"To hear that march proclaimed, to bring"
21952,BOOK II.,Dear Ráma back from wandering.
21953,BOOK II.,From house to house the tidings flew:
21954,BOOK II.,"Each soldier's wife the order knew,"
21955,BOOK II.,And as she listened blithe and gay
21956,BOOK II.,Her husband urged to speed away.
21957,BOOK II.,Captain and soldier soon declared
21958,BOOK II.,The host equipped and all prepared
21959,BOOK II.,"With chariots matching thought for speed,"
21960,BOOK II.,And wagons drawn by ox and steed.
21961,BOOK II.,"When Bharat by Vasishtha's side,"
21962,BOOK II.,"His ready host of warriors eyed,"
21963,BOOK II.,Thus in Sumantra's ear he spoke:
21964,BOOK II.,"""My car and horses quickly yoke."""
21965,BOOK II.,Sumantra hastened to fulfil
21966,BOOK II.,"With ready joy his master's will,"
21967,BOOK II.,And quickly with the chariot sped
21968,BOOK II.,Drawn by fleet horses nobly bred.
21969,BOOK II.,"Then glorious Bharat, true, devout,"
21970,BOOK II.,"Whose genuine valour none could doubt,"
21971,BOOK II.,Gave in fit words his order out;
21972,BOOK II.,For he would seek the shade
21973,BOOK II.,"Of the great distant wood, and there"
21974,BOOK II.,Win his dear brother with his prayer:
21975,BOOK II.,"""Sumantra, haste! my will declare"
21976,BOOK II.,The host be all arrayed.
21977,BOOK II.,"I to the wood my way will take,"
21978,BOOK II.,"To Ráma supplication make,"
21979,BOOK II.,"And for the world's advantage sake,"
21980,BOOK II.,"Will lead him home again."""
21981,BOOK II.,"Then, ordered thus, the charioteer"
21982,BOOK II.,"Who listened with delighted ear,"
21983,BOOK II.,Went forth and gave his orders clear
21984,BOOK II.,To captains of the train.
21985,BOOK II.,"He gave the popular chiefs the word,"
21986,BOOK II.,"And with the news his friends he stirred,"
21987,BOOK II.,And not a single man deferred
21988,BOOK II.,Preparing for the road.
21989,BOOK II.,"Then Bráhman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,"
21990,BOOK II.,"Obedient to Sumantra's call,"
21991,BOOK II.,"Each in his house arose, and all"
21992,BOOK II.,"Yoked elephant or camel tall,"
21993,BOOK II.,"Or ass or noble steed in stall,"
21994,BOOK II.,And full appointed showed.

22000,BOOK II.,
22001,BOOK II.,
22002,BOOK II.,"Then Bharat rose at early morn,"
22003,BOOK II.,And in his noble chariot borne
22004,BOOK II.,Drove forward at a rapid pace
22005,BOOK II.,Eager to look on Ráma's face.
22006,BOOK II.,"The priests and lords, a fair array,"
22007,BOOK II.,In sun-bright chariots led the way.
22008,BOOK II.,"Behind, a well appointed throng,"
22009,BOOK II.,Nine thousand elephants streamed along.
22010,BOOK II.,"Then sixty thousand cars, and then,"
22011,BOOK II.,"With various arms, came fighting men."
22012,BOOK II.,A hundred thousand archers showed
22013,BOOK II.,In lengthened line the steeds they rode--
22014,BOOK II.,"A mighty host, the march to grace"
22015,BOOK II.,"Of Bharat, pride of Raghu's race."
22016,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí and Sumitrá came,"
22017,BOOK II.,"And good Kausalyá, dear to fame:"
22018,BOOK II.,By hopes of Ráma's coming cheered
22019,BOOK II.,They in a radiant car appeared.
22020,BOOK II.,On fared the noble host to see
22021,BOOK II.,"Ráma and Lakshman, wild with glee,"
22022,BOOK II.,"And still each other's ear to please,"
22023,BOOK II.,Of Ráma spoke in words like these:
22024,BOOK II.,"""When shall our happy eyes behold"
22025,BOOK II.,"Our hero true, and pure, and bold,"
22026,BOOK II.,"So lustrous dark, so strong of arm,"
22027,BOOK II.,Who keeps the world from woe and harm?
22028,BOOK II.,The tears that now our eyeballs dim
22029,BOOK II.,"Will vanish at the sight of him,"
22030,BOOK II.,As the whole world's black shadows fly
22031,BOOK II.,"When the bright sun ascends the sky."""
22032,BOOK II.,
22033,BOOK II.,Conversing thus their way pursued
22034,BOOK II.,"The city's joyous multitude,"
22035,BOOK II.,And each in mutual rapture pressed
22036,BOOK II.,A friend or neighbour to his breast.
22037,BOOK II.,"Thus every man of high renown,"
22038,BOOK II.,"And every merchant of the town,"
22039,BOOK II.,"And leading subjects, joyous went"
22040,BOOK II.,Toward Ráma in his banishment.
22041,BOOK II.,"And those who worked the potter's wheel,"
22042,BOOK II.,And artists skilled in gems to deal;
22043,BOOK II.,"And masters of the weaver's art,"
22044,BOOK II.,And those who shaped the sword and dart;
22045,BOOK II.,"And they who golden trinkets made,"
22046,BOOK II.,And those who plied the fuller's trade;
22047,BOOK II.,"And servants trained the bath to heat,"
22048,BOOK II.,And they who dealt in incense sweet;
22049,BOOK II.,"Physicians in their business skilled,"
22050,BOOK II.,And those who wine and mead distilled;
22051,BOOK II.,"And workmen deft in glass who wrought,"
22052,BOOK II.,And those whose snares the peacock caught;
22053,BOOK II.,"With them who bored the ear for rings,"
22054,BOOK II.,"Or sawed, or fashioned ivory things;"
22055,BOOK II.,"And those who knew to mix cement,"
22056,BOOK II.,Or lived by sale of precious scent;
22057,BOOK II.,"And men who washed, and men who sewed,"
22058,BOOK II.,And thralls who mid the herds abode;
22059,BOOK II.,"And fishers of the flood, and they"
22060,BOOK II.,"Who played and sang, and women gay;"
22061,BOOK II.,"And virtuous Bráhmans, Scripture-wise,"
22062,BOOK II.,Of life approved in all men's eyes;
22063,BOOK II.,"These swelled the prince's lengthened train,"
22064,BOOK II.,Borne each in car or bullock wain.
22065,BOOK II.,Fair were the robes they wore upon
22066,BOOK II.,Their limbs where red-hued unguents shone.
22067,BOOK II.,These all in various modes conveyed
22068,BOOK II.,Their journey after Bharat made;

22070,BOOK II.,"Following Bharat on his road,"
22071,BOOK II.,Their chief whose tender love would fain
22072,BOOK II.,Bring his dear brother home again.
22073,BOOK II.,"With elephant, and horse, and car,"
22074,BOOK II.,"The vast procession travelled far,"
22075,BOOK II.,And came where Gangá's waves below
22076,BOOK II.,The town of Sringavera(361) flow.
22077,BOOK II.,"There, with his friends and kinsmen nigh,"
22078,BOOK II.,"Dwelt Guha, Ráma's dear ally,"
22079,BOOK II.,Heroic guardian of the land
22080,BOOK II.,With dauntless heart and ready hand.
22081,BOOK II.,There for a while the mighty force
22082,BOOK II.,"That followed Bharat stayed its course,"
22083,BOOK II.,Gazing on Gangá's bosom stirred
22084,BOOK II.,By many a graceful water-bird.
22085,BOOK II.,"When Bharat viewed his followers there,"
22086,BOOK II.,"And Gangá's water, blest and fair,"
22087,BOOK II.,"The prince, who lore of words possessed,"
22088,BOOK II.,His councillors and lords addressed:
22089,BOOK II.,"""The captains of the army call:"
22090,BOOK II.,"Proclaim this day a halt for all,"
22091,BOOK II.,"That so to-morrow, rested, we"
22092,BOOK II.,May cross this flood that seeks the sea.
22093,BOOK II.,"Meanwhile, descending to the shore,"
22094,BOOK II.,The funeral stream I fain would pour
22095,BOOK II.,From Gangá's fair auspicious tide
22096,BOOK II.,"To him, my father glorified."""
22097,BOOK II.,
22098,BOOK II.,Thus Bharat spoke: each peer and lord
22099,BOOK II.,"Approved his words with one accord,"
22100,BOOK II.,And bade the weary troops repose
22101,BOOK II.,In separate spots where'er they chose.
22102,BOOK II.,"There by the mighty stream that day,"
22103,BOOK II.,Most glorious in its vast array
22104,BOOK II.,The prince's wearied army lay
22105,BOOK II.,In various groups reclined.
22106,BOOK II.,"There Bharat's hours of night were spent,"
22107,BOOK II.,While every eager thought he bent
22108,BOOK II.,On bringing home from banishment
22109,BOOK II.,"His brother, great of mind."

22118,BOOK II.,"The wide expanse of Gangá's shore,"
22119,BOOK II.,"With waving flag and pennon graced,"
22120,BOOK II.,And to his followers spoke in haste:
22121,BOOK II.,"""A mighty army meets my eyes,"
22122,BOOK II.,That rivals Ocean's self in size:
22123,BOOK II.,Where'er I look my very mind
22124,BOOK II.,No limit to the host can find.
22125,BOOK II.,Sure Bharat with some evil thought
22126,BOOK II.,His army to our land has brought.
22127,BOOK II.,"See, huge of form, his flag he rears,"
22128,BOOK II.,That like an Ebony-tree appears.
22129,BOOK II.,"He comes with bonds to take and chain,"
22130,BOOK II.,Or triumph o'er our people slain:
22131,BOOK II.,"And after, Ráma will he slay,--"
22132,BOOK II.,Him whom his father drove away:
22133,BOOK II.,"The power complete he longs to gain,"
22134,BOOK II.,And--task too hard--usurp the reign.
22135,BOOK II.,So Bharat comes with wicked will
22136,BOOK II.,His brother Ráma's blood to spill.
22137,BOOK II.,But Ráma's slave and friend am I;
22138,BOOK II.,He is my lord and dear ally.
22139,BOOK II.,Keep here your watch in arms arrayed
22140,BOOK II.,"Near Gangá's flood to lend him aid,"
22141,BOOK II.,And let my gathered servants stand

22148,BOOK II.,Assemble in defensive throng.
22149,BOOK II.,"But yet, if, free from guilty thought"
22150,BOOK II.,"'Gainst Ráma, he this land have sought,"

22152,BOOK II.,"Across the flood shall make its way."""
22153,BOOK II.,
22154,BOOK II.,He spoke: then bearing in a dish
22155,BOOK II.,"A gift of honey, meat, and fish,"
22156,BOOK II.,The king of the Nishádas drew
22157,BOOK II.,Toward Bharat for an interview.
22158,BOOK II.,When Bharat's noble charioteer
22159,BOOK II.,"Observed the monarch hastening near,"
22160,BOOK II.,"He duly, skilled in courteous lore,"
22161,BOOK II.,The tidings to his master bore:
22162,BOOK II.,"""This aged prince who hither bends"
22163,BOOK II.,"His footsteps with a thousand friends,"
22164,BOOK II.,"Knows, firm ally of Ráma, all"
22165,BOOK II.,That may in Dandak wood befall:
22166,BOOK II.,"Therefore, Kakutstha's son, admit"
22167,BOOK II.,"The monarch, as is right and fit:"
22168,BOOK II.,For doubtless he can clearly tell
22169,BOOK II.,"Where Ráma now and Lakshman dwell."""
22170,BOOK II.,
22171,BOOK II.,"When Bharat heard Sumantra's rede,"
22172,BOOK II.,To his fair words the prince agreed:
22173,BOOK II.,"""Go quickly forth,"" he cried, ""and bring"
22174,BOOK II.,"Before my face the aged king."""
22175,BOOK II.,"King Guha, with his kinsmen near,"
22176,BOOK II.,Rejoiced the summoning to hear:
22177,BOOK II.,"He nearer drew, bowed low his head,"
22178,BOOK II.,And thus to royal Bharat said:
22179,BOOK II.,"""No mansions can our country boast,"
22180,BOOK II.,And unexpected comes thy host:
22181,BOOK II.,But what we have I give thee all:
22182,BOOK II.,Rest in the lodging of thy thrall.
22183,BOOK II.,"See, the Nishádas here have brought"
22184,BOOK II.,The fruit and roots their hands have sought:
22185,BOOK II.,"And we have woodland fare beside,"
22186,BOOK II.,And store of meat both fresh and dried.
22187,BOOK II.,"To rest their weary limbs, I pray"
22188,BOOK II.,This night at least thy host may stay:

22197,BOOK II.,
22198,BOOK II.,Thus the Nishádas' king besought:
22199,BOOK II.,The prince with spirit wisdom-fraught
22200,BOOK II.,Replied in seemly words that blent
22201,BOOK II.,Deep matter with the argument:
22202,BOOK II.,"""Thou, friend of him whom I revere,"
22203,BOOK II.,"With honours high hast met me here,"
22204,BOOK II.,For thou alone wouldst entertain
22205,BOOK II.,"And feed to-day so vast a train."""
22206,BOOK II.,"In such fair words the prince replied,"
22207,BOOK II.,"Then, pointing to the path he cried:"
22208,BOOK II.,"""Which way aright will lead my feet"
22209,BOOK II.,To Bharadvája's calm retreat;
22210,BOOK II.,For all this land near Gangá's streams
22211,BOOK II.,"Pathless and hard to traverse seems?"""
22212,BOOK II.,
22213,BOOK II.,Thus spoke the prince: King Guha heard
22214,BOOK II.,"Delighted every prudent word,"
22215,BOOK II.,"And gazing on that forest wide,"
22216,BOOK II.,"Raised suppliant hands, and thus replied:"
22217,BOOK II.,"""My servants, all the ground who know,"
22218,BOOK II.,"O glorious Prince, with thee shall go"
22219,BOOK II.,"With constant care thy way to guide,"
22220,BOOK II.,And I will journey by thy side.
22221,BOOK II.,But this thy host so wide dispread
22222,BOOK II.,"Wakes in my heart one doubt and dread,"
22223,BOOK II.,"Lest, threatening Ráma good and great,"
22224,BOOK II.,"Ill thoughts thy journey stimulate."""
22225,BOOK II.,
22226,BOOK II.,"But when King Guha, ill at ease,"
22227,BOOK II.,"Declared his fear in words like these,"
22228,BOOK II.,As pure as is the cloudless sky
22229,BOOK II.,With soft voice Bharat made reply:
22230,BOOK II.,"""Suspect me not: ne'er come the time"
22231,BOOK II.,For me to plot so foul a crime!
22232,BOOK II.,"He is my eldest brother, he"
22233,BOOK II.,Is like a father dear to me.
22234,BOOK II.,I go to lead my brother thence
22235,BOOK II.,Who makes the wood his residence.
22236,BOOK II.,No thought but this thy heart should frame:
22237,BOOK II.,"This simple truth my lips proclaim."""
22238,BOOK II.,
22239,BOOK II.,"Then with glad cheer King Guha cried,"
22240,BOOK II.,With Bharat's answer gratified:
22241,BOOK II.,"""Blessed art thou: on earth I see"
22242,BOOK II.,"None who may vie, O Prince, with thee,"
22243,BOOK II.,Who canst of thy free will resign
22244,BOOK II.,The kingdom which unsought is thine.
22245,BOOK II.,"For this, a name that ne'er shall die,"
22246,BOOK II.,"Thy glory through the worlds shall fly,"
22247,BOOK II.,Who fain wouldst balm thy brother's pain
22248,BOOK II.,"And lead the exile home again."""
22249,BOOK II.,
22250,BOOK II.,"As Guha thus, and Bharat, each"
22251,BOOK II.,"To other spoke in friendly speech,"
22252,BOOK II.,"The Day-God sank with glory dead,"
22253,BOOK II.,And night o'er all the sky was spread.
22254,BOOK II.,Soon as King Guha's thoughtful care
22255,BOOK II.,"Had quartered all the army there,"
22256,BOOK II.,"Well honoured, Bharat laid his head"
22257,BOOK II.,Beside Satrughna on a bed.
22258,BOOK II.,But grief for Ráma yet oppressed
22259,BOOK II.,High-minded Bharat's faithful breast--
22260,BOOK II.,Such torment little was deserved
22261,BOOK II.,By him who ne'er from duty swerved.
22262,BOOK II.,The fever raged through every vein
22263,BOOK II.,And burnt him with its inward pain:
22264,BOOK II.,So when in woods the flames leap free
22265,BOOK II.,The fire within consumes the tree.

22270,BOOK II.,"As, banished from the herd, a bull"

22302,BOOK II.,Harbour no doubt or jealous fear:
22303,BOOK II.,I speak the truth with heart sincere:
22304,BOOK II.,For from the grace which he has shown
22305,BOOK II.,Will glory on my name be thrown:
22306,BOOK II.,"Great store of merit shall I gain,"
22307,BOOK II.,"And duteous, form no wish in vain."

22317,BOOK II.,"To move the high-souled Bharat's mind,"
22318,BOOK II.,"But he upon his duty bent,"
22319,BOOK II.,Plied his persuasive argument:
22320,BOOK II.,"""O, how can slumber close mine eyes"
22321,BOOK II.,When lowly couched with Sítá lies
22322,BOOK II.,The royal Ráma? can I give
22323,BOOK II.,"My heart to joy, or even live?"
22324,BOOK II.,"He whom no mighty demon, no,"
22325,BOOK II.,"Nor heavenly God can overthrow,"
22326,BOOK II.,"See, Guha, how he lies, alas,"
22327,BOOK II.,With Sítá couched on gathered grass.
22328,BOOK II.,"By varied labours, long, severe,"
22329,BOOK II.,"By many a prayer and rite austere,"
22330,BOOK II.,"He, Dasaratha's cherished son,"
22331,BOOK II.,"By Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won."
22332,BOOK II.,"Now as his son is forced to fly,"
22333,BOOK II.,The king ere long will surely die:
22334,BOOK II.,"Reft of his guardian hand, forlorn"
22335,BOOK II.,In widowed grief this land will mourn.
22336,BOOK II.,"E'en now perhaps, with toil o'erspent,"
22337,BOOK II.,"The women cease their loud lament,"
22338,BOOK II.,And cries of woe no longer ring
22339,BOOK II.,Throughout the palace of the king.
22340,BOOK II.,But ah for sad Kausalyá! how
22341,BOOK II.,Fare she and mine own mother now?
22342,BOOK II.,"How fares the king? this night, I think,"
22343,BOOK II.,Some of the three in death will sink.
22344,BOOK II.,With hopes upon Satrughna set
22345,BOOK II.,"My mother may survive as yet,"
22346,BOOK II.,But the sad queen will die who bore
22347,BOOK II.,"The hero, for her grief is sore."
22348,BOOK II.,His cherished wish that would have made
22349,BOOK II.,"Dear Ráma king, so long delayed,"

22397,BOOK II.,"Saw his dear brother helpless lie,"
22398,BOOK II.,"Distraught with woe his head he bowed,"
22399,BOOK II.,Embraced him oft and wept aloud.
22400,BOOK II.,"Then Bharat's mothers came, forlorn"
22401,BOOK II.,"Of their dear king, with fasting worn,"
22402,BOOK II.,And stood with weeping eyes around

22404,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá, by her woe oppressed,"
22405,BOOK II.,"The senseless Bharat's limbs caressed,"

22436,BOOK II.,"Food of each varied kind I chose,"
22437,BOOK II.,And every fairest fruit that grows.
22438,BOOK II.,Ráma the hero truly brave
22439,BOOK II.,Declined the gift I humbly gave:
22440,BOOK II.,"His Warrior part he ne'er forgot,"
22441,BOOK II.,And what I brought accepted not:
22442,BOOK II.,"""No gifts, my friend, may we accept:"

22450,BOOK II.,"So Lakshman too from food abstained,"
22451,BOOK II.,And sipped the water that remained:
22452,BOOK II.,"Then with ruled lips, devoutly staid,"
22453,BOOK II.,The three(362) their evening worship paid.
22454,BOOK II.,Then Lakshman with unwearied care
22455,BOOK II.,"Brought heaps of sacred grass, and there"
22456,BOOK II.,"With his own hands he quickly spread,"

22556,BOOK II.,"Unguarded, with deserted wall,"
22557,BOOK II.,"No elephant or steed in stall,"
22558,BOOK II.,My father's royal city shows
22559,BOOK II.,"Her portals open to her foes,"
22560,BOOK II.,"Of bold protectors reft and bare,"
22561,BOOK II.,Defenceless in her dark despair:
22562,BOOK II.,"But still her foes the wish restrain,"
22563,BOOK II.,As men from poisoned cates refrain.
22564,BOOK II.,I from this hour my nights will pass

22570,BOOK II.,So shall I still unbroken save
22571,BOOK II.,The promise which the hero gave.
22572,BOOK II.,"While I remain for Ráma there,"
22573,BOOK II.,"Satrughna will my exile share,"
22574,BOOK II.,"And Ráma in his home again,"
22575,BOOK II.,"With Lakshman, o'er Ayodhyá reign,"
22576,BOOK II.,"for him, to rule and guard the state,"
22577,BOOK II.,The twice-born men shall consecrate.
22578,BOOK II.,"O, may the Gods I serve incline"
22579,BOOK II.,To grant this earnest wish of mine!
22580,BOOK II.,If when I bow before his feet
22581,BOOK II.,"And with all moving arts entreat,"
22582,BOOK II.,"He still deny my prayer,"
22583,BOOK II.,Then with my brother will I live:

22591,BOOK II.,
22592,BOOK II.,
22593,BOOK II.,That night the son of Raghu lay
22594,BOOK II.,On Gangá's bank till break of day:
22595,BOOK II.,Then with the earliest light he woke
22596,BOOK II.,And thus to brave Satrughna spoke.
22597,BOOK II.,"""Rise up, Satrughna, from thy bed:"
22598,BOOK II.,Why sleepest thou the night is fled.
22599,BOOK II.,See how the sun who chases night
22600,BOOK II.,Wakes every lotus with his light.
22601,BOOK II.,"Arise, arise, and first of all"
22602,BOOK II.,"The lord of Sringavera call,"
22603,BOOK II.,For he his friendly aid will lend
22604,BOOK II.,"Our army o'er the flood to send."""
22605,BOOK II.,
22606,BOOK II.,"Thus urged, Satrughna answered: ""I,"
22607,BOOK II.,"Remembering Ráma, sleepless lie."""
22608,BOOK II.,"As thus the brothers, each to each,"
22609,BOOK II.,"The lion-mettled, ended speech,"
22610,BOOK II.,"Came Guha, the Nishádas' king,"
22611,BOOK II.,And spoke with kindly questioning:
22612,BOOK II.,"""Hast thou in comfort passed,"" he cried,"
22613,BOOK II.,"""The night upon the river side?"
22614,BOOK II.,"With thee how fares it? and are these,"
22615,BOOK II.,"Thy soldiers, healthy and at ease?"""
22616,BOOK II.,Thus the Nishádas' lord inquired
22617,BOOK II.,"In gentle words which love inspired,"
22618,BOOK II.,"And Bharat, Ráma's faithful slave,"
22619,BOOK II.,Thus to the king his answer gave:
22620,BOOK II.,"""The night has sweetly passed, and we"
22621,BOOK II.,"Are highly honoured, King, by thee."
22622,BOOK II.,"Now let thy servants boats prepare,"
22623,BOOK II.,"Our army o'er the stream to bear."""
22624,BOOK II.,
22625,BOOK II.,"The speech of Bharat Guha heard,"
22626,BOOK II.,And swift to do his bidding stirred.
22627,BOOK II.,Within the town the monarch sped
22628,BOOK II.,And to his ready kinsmen said:
22629,BOOK II.,"""Awake, each kinsman, rise, each friend!"
22630,BOOK II.,May every joy your lives attend.
22631,BOOK II.,Gather each boat upon the shore
22632,BOOK II.,"And ferry all the army o'er."""
22633,BOOK II.,"Thus Guha spoke: nor they delayed,"
22634,BOOK II.,"But, rising quick, their lord obeyed,"
22635,BOOK II.,"And soon, from every side secured,"
22636,BOOK II.,Five hundred boats were ready moored.
22637,BOOK II.,"Some reared aloft the mystic sign,(363)"
22638,BOOK II.,And mighty bells were hung in line:
22639,BOOK II.,"Of firmest build, gay flags they bore,"
22640,BOOK II.,And sailors for the helm and oar.
22641,BOOK II.,"One such King Guha chose, whereon,"
22642,BOOK II.,"Of fair white cloth, an awning shone,"
22643,BOOK II.,"And sweet musicians charmed the ear,--"
22644,BOOK II.,And bade his servants urge it near.
22645,BOOK II.,"Then Bharat swiftly sprang on board,"
22646,BOOK II.,"And then Satrughna, famous lord,"
22647,BOOK II.,"To whom, with many a royal dame,"
22648,BOOK II.,Kausalyá and Sumitrá came.
22649,BOOK II.,"The household priest went first in place,"
22650,BOOK II.,"The elders, and the Bráhman race,"
22651,BOOK II.,And after them the monarch's train
22652,BOOK II.,Of women borne in many a wain.
22653,BOOK II.,Then high to heaven the shouts of those
22654,BOOK II.,"Who fired the army's huts,(364) arose,"
22655,BOOK II.,"With theirs who bathed along the shore,"
22656,BOOK II.,Or to the boats the baggage bore.
22657,BOOK II.,Full freighted with that mighty force
22658,BOOK II.,"The boats sped swiftly on their course,"
22659,BOOK II.,"By royal Guha's servants manned,"
22660,BOOK II.,And gentle gales the banners fanned.
22661,BOOK II.,"Some boats a crowd of dames conveyed,"
22662,BOOK II.,In others noble coursers neighed;
22663,BOOK II.,"Some chariots and their cattle bore,"
22664,BOOK II.,Some precious wealth and golden store.
22665,BOOK II.,"Across the stream each boat was rowed,"
22666,BOOK II.,"There duly disembarked its load,"
22667,BOOK II.,"And then returning on its way,"
22668,BOOK II.,Sped here and there in merry play.
22669,BOOK II.,Then swimming elephants appeared
22670,BOOK II.,With flying pennons high upreared.
22671,BOOK II.,"And as the drivers urged them o'er,"
22672,BOOK II.,The look of winged mountains wore.
22673,BOOK II.,"Some men in barges reached the strand,"
22674,BOOK II.,Others on rafts came safe to land:
22675,BOOK II.,"Some buoyed with pitchers crossed the tide,"
22676,BOOK II.,And others on their arms relied.
22677,BOOK II.,Thus with the help the monarch gave
22678,BOOK II.,The army crossed pure Gangá's wave:
22679,BOOK II.,Then in auspicious hour it stood
22680,BOOK II.,Within Prayága's famous wood.
22681,BOOK II.,The prince with cheering words addressed
22682,BOOK II.,"His weary men, and bade them rest"
22683,BOOK II.,"Where'er they chose and he,"
22684,BOOK II.,"With priest and deacon by his side,"

22693,BOOK II.,
22694,BOOK II.,The prince of men a league away
22695,BOOK II.,"Saw where the hermit's dwelling lay,"
22696,BOOK II.,"Then with his lords his path pursued,"
22697,BOOK II.,And left his warrior multitude.
22698,BOOK II.,"On foot, as duty taught his mind,"
22699,BOOK II.,He left his warlike gear behind;
22700,BOOK II.,"Two robes of linen cloth he wore,"
22701,BOOK II.,And bade Vasishtha walk before.
22702,BOOK II.,Then Bharat from his lords withdrew
22703,BOOK II.,"When Bharadvája came in view,"
22704,BOOK II.,And toward the holy hermit went
22705,BOOK II.,"Behind Vasishtha, reverent."
22706,BOOK II.,"When Bharadvája, saint austere,"
22707,BOOK II.,"Saw good Vasishtha drawing near,"
22708,BOOK II.,"He cried, upspringing from his seat,"
22709,BOOK II.,"""The grace-gift bring, my friend to greet."""
22710,BOOK II.,"When Saint Vasishtha near him drew,"
22711,BOOK II.,"And Bharat paid the reverence due,"
22712,BOOK II.,The glorious hermit was aware
22713,BOOK II.,That Dasaratha's son was there.
22714,BOOK II.,"The grace-gift, water for their feet"
22715,BOOK II.,"He gave, and offered fruit to eat;"
22716,BOOK II.,"Then, duty-skilled, with friendly speech"
22717,BOOK II.,In seemly order questioned each:
22718,BOOK II.,"""How fares it in Ayodhyá now"
22719,BOOK II.,With treasury and army? how
22720,BOOK II.,"With kith and kin and friends most dear,"
22721,BOOK II.,"With councillor, and prince, and peer?"""
22722,BOOK II.,"But, for he knew the king was dead,"
22723,BOOK II.,Of Dasaratha naught he said.
22724,BOOK II.,Vasishtha and the prince in turn
22725,BOOK II.,Would of the hermit's welfare learn:
22726,BOOK II.,"Of holy fires they fain would hear,"
22727,BOOK II.,"Of pupils, trees, and birds, and deer."
22728,BOOK II.,The glorious saint his answer made
22729,BOOK II.,That all was well in holy shade:
22730,BOOK II.,"Then love of Ráma moved his breast,"
22731,BOOK II.,And thus he questioned of his guest:
22732,BOOK II.,"""Why art thou here, O Prince, whose band"
22733,BOOK II.,With kingly sway protects the land?
22734,BOOK II.,"Declare the cause, explain the whole,"
22735,BOOK II.,For yet some doubt disturbs my soul.
22736,BOOK II.,"He whom Kausalyá bare, whose might"
22737,BOOK II.,"The foemen slays, his line's delight,"
22738,BOOK II.,He who with wife and brother sent
22739,BOOK II.,"Afar now roam in banishment,"
22740,BOOK II.,"Famed prince, to whom his father spake"
22741,BOOK II.,This order for a woman's sake:
22742,BOOK II.,"""Away! and in the forest spend"
22743,BOOK II.,"Thy life till fourteen years shall end""--"
22744,BOOK II.,"Has thou the wish to harm him, bent"
22745,BOOK II.,On sin against the innocent?
22746,BOOK II.,Wouldst thou thine elder's realm enjoy
22747,BOOK II.,"Without a thorn that can annoy?"""
22748,BOOK II.,
22749,BOOK II.,With sobbing voice and tearful eye
22750,BOOK II.,Thus Bharat sadly made reply:
22751,BOOK II.,"""Ah lost am I, if thou, O Saint,"
22752,BOOK II.,Canst thus in thought my heart attaint:
22753,BOOK II.,No warning charge from thee I need;
22754,BOOK II.,Ne'er could such crime from me proceed.
22755,BOOK II.,The words my guilty mother spake
22756,BOOK II.,When fondly jealous for my sake--
22757,BOOK II.,"Think not that I, to triumph moved,"
22758,BOOK II.,Those words approve or e'er approved.
22759,BOOK II.,"O Hermit, I have sought this place"
22760,BOOK II.,"To win the lordly hero's grace,"
22761,BOOK II.,To throw me at my brother's feet
22762,BOOK II.,And lead him to his royal seat.
22763,BOOK II.,"To this, my journey's aim and end,"
22764,BOOK II.,"Thou shouldst, O Saint, thy favour lend:"
22765,BOOK II.,"Where is the lord of earth? do thou,"
22766,BOOK II.,"Most holy, say, where roams he now?"""
22767,BOOK II.,
22768,BOOK II.,"Then, by the saint Vasishtha pressed,"
22769,BOOK II.,"And all the gathered priests beside,"
22770,BOOK II.,To Bharat's dutiful request
22771,BOOK II.,The hermit graciously replied:
22772,BOOK II.,"""Worthy of thee, O Prince, this deed,"
22773,BOOK II.,True son of Raghu's ancient seed.
22774,BOOK II.,"I know thee reverent, well-controlled,"

22776,BOOK II.,I grant thy prayer: in this pursuit
22777,BOOK II.,I know thy heart is resolute.
22778,BOOK II.,'Tis for thy sake those words I said
22779,BOOK II.,That wider still thy fame may spread.
22780,BOOK II.,"I know where Ráma, duty-tried,"
22781,BOOK II.,"His brother, and his wife abide."
22782,BOOK II.,Where Chitrakúta's heights arise
22783,BOOK II.,Thy brother Ráma's dwelling lies.
22784,BOOK II.,"Go thither with the morning's light,"

22797,BOOK II.,He sought Kaikeyí's son to please
22798,BOOK II.,With hospitable courtesies.

22800,BOOK II.,"""Our wants are more than satisfied."
22801,BOOK II.,"The gifts which honoured strangers greet,"
22802,BOOK II.,And water for our weary feet
22803,BOOK II.,"Hast thou bestowed with friendly care,"

22805,BOOK II.,
22806,BOOK II.,"Then Bharadvája spoke, a smile"

22808,BOOK II.,"""I know, dear Prince, thy friendly mind"
22809,BOOK II.,"Will any fare sufficient find,"
22810,BOOK II.,But gladly would I entertain
22811,BOOK II.,And banquet all thine armed train:

22813,BOOK II.,"This longing of my heart allow,"
22814,BOOK II.,"Why hast thou hither bent thy way,"
22815,BOOK II.,And made thy troops behind thee stay?
22816,BOOK II.,Why unattended? couldst thou not
22817,BOOK II.,"With friends and army seek this spot?"""
22818,BOOK II.,
22819,BOOK II.,"Bharat, with reverent hands raised high,"
22820,BOOK II.,To that great hermit made reply:
22821,BOOK II.,"""My troops, for awe of thee, O Sage,"
22822,BOOK II.,I brought not to thy hermitage:
22823,BOOK II.,Troops of a king or monarch's son
22824,BOOK II.,A hermit's home should ever shun.
22825,BOOK II.,Behind me comes a mighty train
22826,BOOK II.,"Wide spreading o'er the ample plain,"
22827,BOOK II.,Where every chief and captain leads
22828,BOOK II.,"Men, elephants, and mettled steeds."
22829,BOOK II.,"I feared, O reverend Sage, lest these"
22830,BOOK II.,"Might harm the holy ground and trees,"
22831,BOOK II.,"Springs might be marred and cots o'erthrown,"
22832,BOOK II.,"So with the priests I came alone."""
22833,BOOK II.,
22834,BOOK II.,"""Bring all thy host,"" the hermit cried,"
22835,BOOK II.,"And Bharat, to his joy, complied."
22836,BOOK II.,"Then to the chapel went the sire,"
22837,BOOK II.,"Where ever burnt the sacred fire,"
22838,BOOK II.,"And first, in order due, with sips"
22839,BOOK II.,Of water purified his lips:
22840,BOOK II.,"To Visvakarmá, then he prayed,"
22841,BOOK II.,His hospitable feast to aid:
22842,BOOK II.,"""Let Visvakarmá hear my call,"
22843,BOOK II.,The God who forms and fashions all:

22845,BOOK II.,Be all my wants this day supplied.

22889,BOOK II.,In holy might preëminent.
22890,BOOK II.,Then as with hands in reverence raised
22891,BOOK II.,"Absorbed in thought he eastward gazed,"
22892,BOOK II.,The deities he thus addressed
22893,BOOK II.,Came each in semblance manifest.
22894,BOOK II.,Delicious gales that cooled the frame
22895,BOOK II.,"From Malaya and Dardar came,"
22896,BOOK II.,That kissed those scented hills and threw
22897,BOOK II.,Auspicious fragrance where they blew.
22898,BOOK II.,Then falling fast in sweetest showers
22899,BOOK II.,"Came from the sky immortal flowers,"
22900,BOOK II.,And all the airy region round
22901,BOOK II.,With heavenly drums was made to sound.
22902,BOOK II.,"Then breathed a soft celestial breeze,"
22903,BOOK II.,"Then danced the bright Apsarases,"
22904,BOOK II.,"The minstrels and the Gods advanced,"
22905,BOOK II.,And warbling lutes the soul entranced.
22906,BOOK II.,"The earth and sky that music filled,"
22907,BOOK II.,"And through each ear it softly thrilled,"
22908,BOOK II.,As from the heavenly quills it fell
22909,BOOK II.,With time and tune attempered well.
22910,BOOK II.,Soon as the minstrels ceased to play
22911,BOOK II.,"And airs celestial died away,"
22912,BOOK II.,The troops of Bharat saw amazed
22913,BOOK II.,What Visvakarmá's art had raised.
22914,BOOK II.,"On every side, five leagues around,"
22915,BOOK II.,"All smooth and level lay the ground,"
22916,BOOK II.,With fresh green grass that charmed the sight
22917,BOOK II.,Like sapphires blent with lazulite.
22918,BOOK II.,"There the Wood-apple hung its load,"
22919,BOOK II.,"The Mango and the Citron glowed,"
22920,BOOK II.,"The Bel and scented Jak were there,"

22922,BOOK II.,"There, brought from Northern Kuru, stood"
22923,BOOK II.,"Rich in delights, the glorious wood,"
22924,BOOK II.,And many a stream was seen to glide
22925,BOOK II.,With flowering trees along its side.
22926,BOOK II.,"There mansions rose with four wide halls,"
22927,BOOK II.,"And elephants and chargers' stalls,"
22928,BOOK II.,"And many a house of royal state,"
22929,BOOK II.,Triumphal arc and bannered gate.
22930,BOOK II.,"With noble doorways, sought the sky,"
22931,BOOK II.,"Like a pale cloud, a palace high,"
22932,BOOK II.,"Which far and wide rare fragrance shed,"
22933,BOOK II.,With wreaths of white engarlanded.
22934,BOOK II.,"Square was its shape, its halls were wide,"
22935,BOOK II.,"With many a seat and couch supplied,"
22936,BOOK II.,"Drink of all kinds, and every meat"
22937,BOOK II.,Such as celestial Gods might eat.
22938,BOOK II.,Then at the bidding of the seer
22939,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí's strong-armed son drew near,"
22940,BOOK II.,And passed within that fair abode
22941,BOOK II.,Which with the noblest jewels glowed.
22942,BOOK II.,"Then, as Vasishtha led the way,"
22943,BOOK II.,"The councillors, in due array,"
22944,BOOK II.,Followed delighted and amazed
22945,BOOK II.,And on the glorious structure gazed.
22946,BOOK II.,"Then Bharat, Raghu's son, drew near"
22947,BOOK II.,"The kingly throne, with prince and peer,"
22948,BOOK II.,Whereby the chouri in the shade
22949,BOOK II.,Of the white canopy was laid.
22950,BOOK II.,Before the throne he humbly bent
22951,BOOK II.,"And honoured Ráma, reverent,"
22952,BOOK II.,"Then in his hand the chouri bore,"
22953,BOOK II.,And sat where sits a councillor.
22954,BOOK II.,His ministers and household priest
22955,BOOK II.,"Sat by degrees from chief to least,"
22956,BOOK II.,Then sat the captain of the host
22957,BOOK II.,And all the men he honoured most.
22958,BOOK II.,"Then when the saint his order gave,"
22959,BOOK II.,Each river with enchanted wave
22960,BOOK II.,Rolled milk and curds divinely sweet
22961,BOOK II.,Before the princely Bharat's feet;
22962,BOOK II.,"And dwellings fair on either side,"
22963,BOOK II.,"With gay white plaster beautified,"
22964,BOOK II.,"Their heavenly roofs were seen to lift,"
22965,BOOK II.,The Bráhman Bharadvája's gift.
22966,BOOK II.,"Then straight by Lord Kuvera sent,"
22967,BOOK II.,Gay with celestial ornament
22968,BOOK II.,"Of bright attire and jewels' shine,"
22969,BOOK II.,Came twenty thousand nymphs divine:
22970,BOOK II.,The man on whom those beauties glanced
22971,BOOK II.,That moment felt his soul entranced.
22972,BOOK II.,With them from Nandan's blissful shades
22973,BOOK II.,Came twenty thousand heavenly maids.
22974,BOOK II.,"Tumburu, Nárad, Gopa came,"
22975,BOOK II.,"And Sutanu, like radiant flame,"
22976,BOOK II.,"The kings of the Gandharva throng,"
22977,BOOK II.,And ravished Bharat with their song.
22978,BOOK II.,"Then spoke the saint, and swift obeyed"
22979,BOOK II.,"Alambúshá, the fairest maid,"
22980,BOOK II.,"And Misrakesí bright to view,"
22981,BOOK II.,"Ramaná, Pundríká too,"
22982,BOOK II.,And danced to him with graceful ease
22983,BOOK II.,The dances of Apsarases.
22984,BOOK II.,"All chaplets that by Gods are worn,"
22985,BOOK II.,"Or Chaitraratha's graves adorn,"
22986,BOOK II.,Bloomed by the saint's command arrayed
22987,BOOK II.,On branches in Prayága's shade.
22988,BOOK II.,When at the saint's command the breeze
22989,BOOK II.,"Made music with the Vilva trees,"
22990,BOOK II.,To wave in rhythmic beat began
22991,BOOK II.,"The boughs of each Myrobolan,"
22992,BOOK II.,And holy fig-trees wore the look
22993,BOOK II.,"Of dancers, as their leaflets shook."
22994,BOOK II.,"The fair Tamála, palm, and pine,"
22995,BOOK II.,"With trees that tower and plants that twine,"
22996,BOOK II.,The sweetly varying forms displayed
22997,BOOK II.,Of stately dame or bending maid.
22998,BOOK II.,"Here men the foaming winecup quaffed,"
22999,BOOK II.,"Here drank of milk full many a draught,"
23000,BOOK II.,"And tasted meats of every kind,"
23001,BOOK II.,"Well dressed, whatever pleased their mind."
23002,BOOK II.,"Then beauteous women, seven or eight,"
23003,BOOK II.,Stood ready by each man to wait:
23004,BOOK II.,Beside the stream his limbs they stripped
23005,BOOK II.,And in the cooling water dipped.
23006,BOOK II.,"And then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,"
23007,BOOK II.,"With soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried,"
23008,BOOK II.,And sitting on the lovely bank
23009,BOOK II.,Held up the winecup as he drank.
23010,BOOK II.,Nor did the grooms forget to feed
23011,BOOK II.,"Camel and mule and ox and steed,"
23012,BOOK II.,"For there were stores of roasted grain,"
23013,BOOK II.,Of honey and of sugar-cane.
23014,BOOK II.,So fast the wild excitement spread
23015,BOOK II.,"Among the warriors Bharat led,"
23016,BOOK II.,That all the mighty army through
23017,BOOK II.,"The groom no more his charger knew,"
23018,BOOK II.,And he who drove might seek in vain
23019,BOOK II.,To tell his elephant again.
23020,BOOK II.,"With every joy and rapture fired,"
23021,BOOK II.,"Entranced with all the heart desired,"
23022,BOOK II.,The myriads of the host that night
23023,BOOK II.,Revelled delirious with delight.
23024,BOOK II.,Urged by the damsels at their side
23025,BOOK II.,In wild delight the warriors cried:
23026,BOOK II.,"""Ne'er will we seek Ayodhyá, no,"
23027,BOOK II.,Nor yet to Dandak forest go:
23028,BOOK II.,Here will we stay: may happy fate
23029,BOOK II.,"On Bharat and on Ráma wait."""
23030,BOOK II.,Thus cried the army gay and free
23031,BOOK II.,"Exulting in their lawless glee,"
23032,BOOK II.,Both infantry and those who rode
23033,BOOK II.,"On elephants, or steeds bestrode,"
23034,BOOK II.,"Ten thousand voices shouting, ""This"
23035,BOOK II.,"Is heaven indeed for perfect bliss."""
23036,BOOK II.,"With garlands decked they idly strayed,"
23037,BOOK II.,And danced and laughed and sang and played.
23038,BOOK II.,"At length as every soldier eyed,"
23039,BOOK II.,"With food like Amrit satisfied,"
23040,BOOK II.,"Each dainty cate and tempting meat,"
23041,BOOK II.,No longer had he care to eat.
23042,BOOK II.,"Thus soldier, servant, dame, and slave"
23043,BOOK II.,Received whate'er the wish might crave.
23044,BOOK II.,As each in new-wrought clothes arrayed
23045,BOOK II.,Enjoyed the feast before him laid.
23046,BOOK II.,Each man was seen in white attire
23047,BOOK II.,Unstained by spot or speck of mire:
23048,BOOK II.,"None was athirst or hungry there,"
23049,BOOK II.,And none had dust upon his hair.
23050,BOOK II.,On every side in woody dells
23051,BOOK II.,"Was milky food in bubbling wells,"
23052,BOOK II.,And there were all-supplying cows
23053,BOOK II.,And honey dropping from the boughs.
23054,BOOK II.,Nor wanted lakes of flower-made drink
23055,BOOK II.,"With piles of meat upon the brink,"
23056,BOOK II.,"Boiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,"
23057,BOOK II.,"Peachick and jungle-fowl and deer,"
23058,BOOK II.,"There was the flesh of kid and boar,"
23059,BOOK II.,"And dainty sauce in endless store,"
23060,BOOK II.,"With juice of flowers concocted well,"
23061,BOOK II.,"And soup that charmed the taste and smell,"
23062,BOOK II.,"And pounded fruits of bitter taste,"
23063,BOOK II.,And many a bath was ready placed
23064,BOOK II.,Down by each river's shelving side
23065,BOOK II.,"There stood great basins well supplied,"
23066,BOOK II.,"And laid therein, of dazzling sheen,"
23067,BOOK II.,"White brushes for the teeth were seen,"
23068,BOOK II.,And many a covered box wherein
23069,BOOK II.,Was sandal powdered for the skin.
23070,BOOK II.,"And mirrors bright with constant care,"
23071,BOOK II.,"And piles of new attire were there,"
23072,BOOK II.,"And store of sandals and of shoes,"
23073,BOOK II.,"Thousands of pairs, for all to choose:"
23074,BOOK II.,"Eye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,"
23075,BOOK II.,Umbrellas fair and bows appeared.
23076,BOOK II.,"Lakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid,(368)"
23077,BOOK II.,"And some for pleasant bathing made,"
23078,BOOK II.,"With waters fair, and smooth incline"
23079,BOOK II.,"For camels, horses, mules, and kine."
23080,BOOK II.,There saw they barley heaped on high
23081,BOOK II.,The countless cattle to supply:
23082,BOOK II.,The golden grain shone fair and bright
23083,BOOK II.,As sapphires or the lazulite.
23084,BOOK II.,To all the gathered host it seemed
23085,BOOK II.,"As if that magic scene they dreamed,"
23086,BOOK II.,"And wonder, as they gazed, increased"
23087,BOOK II.,At Bharadvája's glorious feast.
23088,BOOK II.,
23089,BOOK II.,Thus in the hermit's grove they spent
23090,BOOK II.,"That night in joy and merriment,"
23091,BOOK II.,Blest as the Gods who take their ease
23092,BOOK II.,Under the shade of Nandan's trees.
23093,BOOK II.,"Each minstrel bade the saint adieu,"
23094,BOOK II.,"And to his blissful mansion flew,"
23095,BOOK II.,And every stream and heavenly dame
23096,BOOK II.,Returned as swiftly as she came.

23101,BOOK II.,Canto XCII. Bharat's Farewell.
23102,BOOK II.,
23103,BOOK II.,
23104,BOOK II.,So Bharat with his army spent
23105,BOOK II.,"The watches of the night content,"
23106,BOOK II.,"And gladly, with the morning's light"
23107,BOOK II.,Drew near his host the anchorite.
23108,BOOK II.,When Bharadvája saw him stand
23109,BOOK II.,"With hand in reverence joined to hand,"
23110,BOOK II.,"When fires of worship had been fed,"
23111,BOOK II.,He looked upon the prince and said:
23112,BOOK II.,"""O blameless son, I pray thee tell,"
23113,BOOK II.,Did the past night content thee well?
23114,BOOK II.,Say if the feast my care supplied
23115,BOOK II.,"Thy host of followers gratified."""
23116,BOOK II.,
23117,BOOK II.,"His hands he joined, his head he bent"
23118,BOOK II.,And spoke in answer reverent
23119,BOOK II.,To the most high and radiant sage
23120,BOOK II.,Who issued from his hermitage:
23121,BOOK II.,"""Well have I passed the night: thy feast"
23122,BOOK II.,Gave joy to every man and beast;
23123,BOOK II.,"And I, great lord, and every peer"
23124,BOOK II.,"Were satisfied with sumptuous cheer,"
23125,BOOK II.,Thy banquet has delighted all
23126,BOOK II.,"From highest chief to meanest thrall,"
23127,BOOK II.,And rich attire and drink and meat
23128,BOOK II.,Banished the thought of toil and heat.
23129,BOOK II.,"And now, O Hermit good and great,"
23130,BOOK II.,A boon of thee I supplicate.
23131,BOOK II.,To Ráma's side my steps I bend:
23132,BOOK II.,Do thou with friendly eye commend.
23133,BOOK II.,O tell me how to guide my feet
23134,BOOK II.,To virtuous Ráma's lone retreat:
23135,BOOK II.,"Great Hermit, I entreat thee, say"
23136,BOOK II.,"How far from here and which the way."""
23137,BOOK II.,
23138,BOOK II.,Thus by fraternal love inspired
23139,BOOK II.,The chieftain of the saint inquired:
23140,BOOK II.,Then thus replied the glorious seer
23141,BOOK II.,"Of matchless might, of vows austere:"
23142,BOOK II.,"""Ere the fourth league from here be passed,"
23143,BOOK II.,"Amid a forest wild and vast,"
23144,BOOK II.,"Stands Chitrakúta's mountain tall,"
23145,BOOK II.,Lovely with wood and waterfall.
23146,BOOK II.,North of the mountain thou wilt see
23147,BOOK II.,"The beauteous stream Mandákiní,"
23148,BOOK II.,"Where swarm the waterfowl below,"
23149,BOOK II.,And gay trees on the margin grow.
23150,BOOK II.,Then will a leafy cot between
23151,BOOK II.,The river and the hill be seen:
23152,BOOK II.,"'Tis Ráma's, and the princely pair"
23153,BOOK II.,Of brothers live for certain there.
23154,BOOK II.,"Hence to the south thine army lead,"
23155,BOOK II.,"And then more southward still proceed,"
23156,BOOK II.,"So shalt thou find his lone retreat,"
23157,BOOK II.,"And there the son of Raghu meet."""
23158,BOOK II.,
23159,BOOK II.,"Soon as the ordered march they knew,"
23160,BOOK II.,"The widows of the monarch flew,"
23161,BOOK II.,"Leaving their cars, most meet to ride,"
23162,BOOK II.,And flocked to Bharadvája's side.
23163,BOOK II.,There with the good Sumitrá Queen
23164,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá, sad and worn, was seen,"
23165,BOOK II.,"Caressing, still with sorrow faint,"
23166,BOOK II.,"The feet of that illustrious saint,"
23167,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí too, her longings crossed,"
23168,BOOK II.,"Reproached of all, her object lost,"
23169,BOOK II.,"Before the famous hermit came,"
23170,BOOK II.,"And clasped his feet, o'erwhelmed with shame."
23171,BOOK II.,With circling steps she humbly went
23172,BOOK II.,"Around the saint preëminent,"
23173,BOOK II.,And stood not far from Bharat's side
23174,BOOK II.,"With heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed."
23175,BOOK II.,"Then the great seer, who never broke"
23176,BOOK II.,"One holy vow, to Bharat spoke:"
23177,BOOK II.,"""Speak, Raghu's son: I fain would learn"
23178,BOOK II.,"The story of each queen in turn."""
23179,BOOK II.,
23180,BOOK II.,Obedient to the high request
23181,BOOK II.,"By Bharadvája thus addressed,"
23182,BOOK II.,"His reverent hands together laid,"
23183,BOOK II.,"He, skilled in speech, his answer made:"
23184,BOOK II.,"""She whom, O Saint, thou seest here"
23185,BOOK II.,"A Goddess in her form appear,"
23186,BOOK II.,"Was the chief consort of the king,"
23187,BOOK II.,Now worn with fast and sorrowing.
23188,BOOK II.,As Aditi in days of yore
23189,BOOK II.,"The all-preserving Vishnu bore,"
23190,BOOK II.,Kausalyá bore with happy fate
23191,BOOK II.,Lord Ráma of the lion's gait.
23192,BOOK II.,"She who, transfixed with torturing pangs,"
23193,BOOK II.,"On her left arm so fondly hangs,"
23194,BOOK II.,As when her withering leaves decay
23195,BOOK II.,"Droops by the wood the Cassia spray,"
23196,BOOK II.,"Sumitrá, pained with woe, is she,"
23197,BOOK II.,The consort second of the three:
23198,BOOK II.,"Two princely sons the lady bare,"
23199,BOOK II.,Fair as the Gods in heaven are fair.
23200,BOOK II.,"And she, the wicked dame through whom"
23201,BOOK II.,"My brothers' lives are wrapped in gloom,"
23202,BOOK II.,"And mourning for his offspring dear,"
23203,BOOK II.,"The king has sought his heavenly sphere,--"
23204,BOOK II.,"Proud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,"
23205,BOOK II.,"Self-fancied darling of my sire,"
23206,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí, most ambitious queen,"
23207,BOOK II.,"Unlovely with her lovely mien,"
23208,BOOK II.,"My mother she, whose impious will"
23209,BOOK II.,"Is ever bent on deeds of ill,"
23210,BOOK II.,In whom the root and spring I see
23211,BOOK II.,"Of all this woe which crushes me."""
23212,BOOK II.,
23213,BOOK II.,"Quick breathing like a furious snake,"
23214,BOOK II.,"With tears and sobs the hero spake,"
23215,BOOK II.,With reddened eyes aglow with rage.
23216,BOOK II.,"And Bharadvája, mighty sage,"
23217,BOOK II.,"Supreme in wisdom, calm and grave,"
23218,BOOK II.,In words like these good counsel gave:
23219,BOOK II.,"""O Bharat, hear the words I say;"
23220,BOOK II.,On her the fault thou must not lay:
23221,BOOK II.,For many a blessing yet will spring
23222,BOOK II.,"From banished Ráma's wandering."""
23223,BOOK II.,"And Bharat, with that promise cheered,"
23224,BOOK II.,"Went circling round that saint revered,"
23225,BOOK II.,"He humbly bade farewell, and then"
23226,BOOK II.,Gave orders to collect his men.
23227,BOOK II.,Prompt at the summons thousands flew
23228,BOOK II.,"To cars which noble coursers drew,"
23229,BOOK II.,"Bright-gleaming, glorious to behold,"
23230,BOOK II.,Adorned with wealth of burnished gold.
23231,BOOK II.,"Then female elephants and male,"
23232,BOOK II.,"Gold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,"
23233,BOOK II.,Marched with their bright bells' tinkling chime
23234,BOOK II.,Like clouds when ends the summer time:
23235,BOOK II.,"Some cars were huge and some were light,"
23236,BOOK II.,"For heavy draught or rapid flight,"
23237,BOOK II.,"Of costly price, of every kind,"
23238,BOOK II.,With clouds of infantry behind.
23239,BOOK II.,"The dames, Kausalyá at their head,"
23240,BOOK II.,"Were in the noblest chariots led,"
23241,BOOK II.,And every gentle bosom beat
23242,BOOK II.,With hope the banished prince to meet.
23243,BOOK II.,"The royal Bharat, glory-crowned,"
23244,BOOK II.,"With all his retinue around,"
23245,BOOK II.,"Borne in a beauteous litter rode,"
23246,BOOK II.,Like the young moon and sun that glowed.
23247,BOOK II.,"The army as it streamed along,"
23248,BOOK II.,"Cars, elephants, in endless throng,"
23249,BOOK II.,"Showed, marching on its southward way,"
23250,BOOK II.,Like autumn clouds in long array.

23255,BOOK II.,Canto XCIII. Chitrakúta In Sight.
23256,BOOK II.,
23257,BOOK II.,
23258,BOOK II.,As through the woods its way pursued
23259,BOOK II.,"That mighty bannered multitude,"
23260,BOOK II.,Wild elephants in terror fled
23261,BOOK II.,"With all the startled herds they led,"
23262,BOOK II.,"And bears and deer were seen on hill,"
23263,BOOK II.,"In forest glade, by every rill."
23264,BOOK II.,"Wide as the sea from coast to coast,"
23265,BOOK II.,The high-souled Bharat's mighty host
23266,BOOK II.,Covered the earth as cloudy trains
23267,BOOK II.,Obscure the sky when fall the rains.
23268,BOOK II.,"The stately elephants he led,"
23269,BOOK II.,"And countless steeds the land o'erspread,"
23270,BOOK II.,So closely crowded that between
23271,BOOK II.,Their serried ranks no ground was seen.
23272,BOOK II.,"Then when the host had travelled far,"
23273,BOOK II.,"And steeds were worn who drew the car,"
23274,BOOK II.,The glorious Bharat thus addressed
23275,BOOK II.,"Vasishtha, of his lords the best:"
23276,BOOK II.,"""The spot, methinks, we now behold"
23277,BOOK II.,"Of which the holy hermit told,"
23278,BOOK II.,"For, as his words described, I trace"
23279,BOOK II.,Each several feature of the place:
23280,BOOK II.,"Before us Chitrakúta shows,"
23281,BOOK II.,Mandákiní beside us flows:
23282,BOOK II.,Afar umbrageous woods arise
23283,BOOK II.,Like darksome clouds that veil the skies.
23284,BOOK II.,Now tread these mountain-beasts of mine
23285,BOOK II.,On Chitrakúta's fair incline.
23286,BOOK II.,The trees their rain of blossoms shed
23287,BOOK II.,"On table-lands beneath them spread,"
23288,BOOK II.,As from black clouds the floods descend
23289,BOOK II.,When the hot days of summer end.
23290,BOOK II.,"Satrughna, look, the mountain see"
23291,BOOK II.,"Where heavenly minstrels wander free,"
23292,BOOK II.,"And horses browse beneath the steep,"
23293,BOOK II.,Countless as monsters in the deep.
23294,BOOK II.,Scared by my host the mountain deer
23295,BOOK II.,Starting with tempest speed appear
23296,BOOK II.,Like the long lines of cloud that fly
23297,BOOK II.,In autumn through the windy sky.
23298,BOOK II.,"See, every warrior shows his head"
23299,BOOK II.,With fragrant blooms engarlanded;
23300,BOOK II.,All look like southern soldiers who
23301,BOOK II.,Lift up their shields of azure hue.
23302,BOOK II.,"This lonely wood beneath the hill,"
23303,BOOK II.,"That was so dark and drear and still,"
23304,BOOK II.,Covered with men in endless streams
23305,BOOK II.,Now like Ayodhyá's city seems.
23306,BOOK II.,The dust which countless hoofs excite
23307,BOOK II.,Obscures the sky and veils the light;
23308,BOOK II.,"But see, swift winds those clouds dispel"
23309,BOOK II.,As if they strove to please me well.
23310,BOOK II.,"See, guided in their swift career"
23311,BOOK II.,"By many a skilful charioteer,"
23312,BOOK II.,Those cars by fleetest coursers drawn
23313,BOOK II.,Race onward over glade and lawn.
23314,BOOK II.,"Look, startled as the host comes near"
23315,BOOK II.,"The lovely peacocks fly in fear,"
23316,BOOK II.,Gorgeous as if the fairest blooms
23317,BOOK II.,Of earth had glorified their plumes.
23318,BOOK II.,Look where the sheltering covert shows
23319,BOOK II.,"The trooping deer, both bucks and does,"
23320,BOOK II.,That occupy in countless herds
23321,BOOK II.,This mountain populous with birds.
23322,BOOK II.,Most lovely to my mind appears
23323,BOOK II.,This place which every charm endears:
23324,BOOK II.,Fair as the road where tread the Blest;
23325,BOOK II.,Here holy hermits take their rest.
23326,BOOK II.,Then let the army onward press
23327,BOOK II.,And duly search each green recess
23328,BOOK II.,"For the two lion-lords, till we"
23329,BOOK II.,"Ráma once more and Lakshman see."""
23330,BOOK II.,
23331,BOOK II.,Thus Bharat spoke: and hero bands
23332,BOOK II.,Of men with weapons in their hands
23333,BOOK II.,Entered the tangled forest: then
23334,BOOK II.,A spire of smoke appeared in ken.
23335,BOOK II.,Soon as they saw the rising smoke
23336,BOOK II.,To Bharat they returned and spoke:
23337,BOOK II.,"""No fire where men are not: 'tis clear"
23338,BOOK II.,That Raghu's sons are dwelling here.
23339,BOOK II.,Or if not here those heroes dwell
23340,BOOK II.,"Whose mighty arms their foeman quell,"
23341,BOOK II.,Still other hermits here must be
23342,BOOK II.,"Like Ráma, true and good as he."""
23343,BOOK II.,
23344,BOOK II.,His ears attentive Bharat lent
23345,BOOK II.,"To their resistless argument,"
23346,BOOK II.,Then to his troops the chief who broke
23347,BOOK II.,His foe's embattled armies spoke:
23348,BOOK II.,"""Here let the troops in silence stay;"
23349,BOOK II.,One step beyond they must not stray.
23350,BOOK II.,"Come Dhrishti and Sumantra, you"
23351,BOOK II.,"With me alone the path pursue."""
23352,BOOK II.,"Their leader's speech the warriors heard,"
23353,BOOK II.,"And from his place no soldier stirred,"
23354,BOOK II.,And Bharat bent his eager eyes
23355,BOOK II.,Where curling smoke was seen to rise.
23356,BOOK II.,
23357,BOOK II.,"The host his order well obeyed,"
23358,BOOK II.,And halting there in silence stayed
23359,BOOK II.,Watching where from the thicket's shade
23360,BOOK II.,They saw the smoke appear.
23361,BOOK II.,"And joy through all the army ran,"
23362,BOOK II.,"""Soon shall we meet,"" thought every man,"
23363,BOOK II.,"""The prince we hold so dear."""

23370,BOOK II.,
23371,BOOK II.,There long the son of Raghu dwelt
23372,BOOK II.,And love for hill and wood he felt.
23373,BOOK II.,Then his Videhan spouse to please
23374,BOOK II.,"And his own heart of woe to ease,"
23375,BOOK II.,Like some Immortal--Indra so
23376,BOOK II.,Might Swarga's charms to Sachí show--
23377,BOOK II.,Drew her sweet eyes to each delight
23378,BOOK II.,Of Chitrakúta's lovely height:

23385,BOOK II.,Bright with a thousand metal dyes
23386,BOOK II.,His lofty summits cleave the skies.
23387,BOOK II.,"See, there a silvery sheen is spread,"
23388,BOOK II.,And there like blood the rocks are red.
23389,BOOK II.,"There shows a streak of emerald green,"
23390,BOOK II.,And pink and yellow glow between.
23391,BOOK II.,"There where the higher peaks ascend,"
23392,BOOK II.,"Crystal and flowers and topaz blend,"
23393,BOOK II.,And others flash their light afar
23394,BOOK II.,Like mercury or some fair star:
23395,BOOK II.,With such a store of metals dyed
23396,BOOK II.,The king of hills is glorified.
23397,BOOK II.,There through the wild birds' populous home
23398,BOOK II.,The harmless bear and tiger roam:
23399,BOOK II.,Hyćnas range the woody slopes
23400,BOOK II.,With herds of deer and antelopes.
23401,BOOK II.,"See, love, the trees that clothe his side"
23402,BOOK II.,"All lovely in their summer pride,"
23403,BOOK II.,"In richest wealth of leaves arrayed,"
23404,BOOK II.,"With flower and fruit and light and shade,"
23405,BOOK II.,Look where the young Rose-apple glows;
23406,BOOK II.,What loaded boughs the Mango shows;
23407,BOOK II.,"See, waving in the western wind"
23408,BOOK II.,"The light leaves of the Tamarind,"
23409,BOOK II.,And mark that giant Peepul through
23410,BOOK II.,The feathery clump of tall bamboo.(369)
23411,BOOK II.,"Look, on the level lands above,"
23412,BOOK II.,Delighting in successful love
23413,BOOK II.,In sweet enjoyment many a pair
23414,BOOK II.,"Of heavenly minstrels revels there,"
23415,BOOK II.,While overhanging boughs support
23416,BOOK II.,Their swords and mantles as they sport:
23417,BOOK II.,Then see that pleasant shelter where
23418,BOOK II.,Play the bright Daughters of the Air.(370)
23419,BOOK II.,The mountain seems with bright cascade
23420,BOOK II.,"And sweet rill bursting from the shade,"
23421,BOOK II.,Like some majestic elephant o'er
23422,BOOK II.,Whose burning head the torrents pour.
23423,BOOK II.,Where breathes the man who would not feel
23424,BOOK II.,"Delicious languor o'er him steal,"
23425,BOOK II.,As the young morning breeze that springs
23426,BOOK II.,"From the cool cave with balmy wings,"
23427,BOOK II.,Breathes round him laden with the scent
23428,BOOK II.,Of bud and blossom dew-besprent?
23429,BOOK II.,If many autumns here I spent
23430,BOOK II.,"With thee, my darling innocent,"
23431,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman, I should never know"
23432,BOOK II.,"The torture of the fires of woe,"
23433,BOOK II.,"This varied scene so charms my sight,"
23434,BOOK II.,"This mount so fills me with delight,"
23435,BOOK II.,"Where flowers in wild profusion spring,"
23436,BOOK II.,And ripe fruits glow and sweet birds sing.

23438,BOOK II.,Springs from my dwelling in the wood:

23441,BOOK II.,"My darling, dost thou feel with me"
23442,BOOK II.,"Delight from every charm we see,"
23443,BOOK II.,Of which the mind and every sense
23444,BOOK II.,Feel the enchanting influence?
23445,BOOK II.,"My fathers who have passed away,"
23446,BOOK II.,"The royal saints, were wont to say,"
23447,BOOK II.,That life in woodland shades like this
23448,BOOK II.,Secures a king immortal bliss.

23453,BOOK II.,But all is fairer still by night:
23454,BOOK II.,"Each rock reflects a softer light,"
23455,BOOK II.,When the whole mount from foot to crest
23456,BOOK II.,In robes of lambent flame is dressed;
23457,BOOK II.,When from a million herbs a blaze
23458,BOOK II.,"Of their own luminous glory plays,"
23459,BOOK II.,"And clothed in fire each deep ravine,"
23460,BOOK II.,Each pinnacle and crag is seen.
23461,BOOK II.,"Some parts the look of mansions wear,"
23462,BOOK II.,"And others are as gardens fair,"
23463,BOOK II.,While others seem a massive block
23464,BOOK II.,Of solid undivided rock.
23465,BOOK II.,Behold those pleasant beds o'erlaid
23466,BOOK II.,"With lotus leaves, for lovers made,"
23467,BOOK II.,Where mountain birch and costus throw
23468,BOOK II.,Cool shadows on the pair below.
23469,BOOK II.,See where the lovers in their play
23470,BOOK II.,"Have cast their flowery wreaths away,"
23471,BOOK II.,And fruit and lotus buds that crowned
23472,BOOK II.,Their brows lie trodden on the ground.

23577,BOOK II.,"The varied beauties of the wild,"
23578,BOOK II.,"The hill, the brook and each fair spot,"
23579,BOOK II.,Then turned to seek their leafy cot.
23580,BOOK II.,North of the mountain Ráma found
23581,BOOK II.,"A cavern in the sloping ground,"
23582,BOOK II.,"Charming to view, its floor was strown"
23583,BOOK II.,"With many a mass of ore and stone,"
23584,BOOK II.,In secret shadow far retired
23585,BOOK II.,"Where gay birds sang with joy inspired,"
23586,BOOK II.,And trees their graceful branches swayed
23587,BOOK II.,With loads of blossom downward weighed.
23588,BOOK II.,Soon as he saw the cave which took
23589,BOOK II.,"Each living heart and chained the look,"
23590,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma spoke to Sítá who
23591,BOOK II.,Gazed wondering on the silvan view:
23592,BOOK II.,"""Does this fair cave beneath the height,"
23593,BOOK II.,"Videhan lady, charm thy sight?"
23594,BOOK II.,Then let us resting here a while
23595,BOOK II.,The languor of the way beguile.
23596,BOOK II.,That block of stone so smooth and square
23597,BOOK II.,"Was set for thee to rest on there,"
23598,BOOK II.,And like a thriving Kesar tree
23599,BOOK II.,"This flowery shrub o'ershadows thee."""
23600,BOOK II.,"Thus Ráma spoke, and Janak's child,"
23601,BOOK II.,"By nature ever soft and mild,"
23602,BOOK II.,In tender words which love betrayed
23603,BOOK II.,Her answer to the hero made:
23604,BOOK II.,"""O pride of Raghu's children, still"
23605,BOOK II.,My pleasure is to do thy will.
23606,BOOK II.,Enough for me thy wish to know:
23607,BOOK II.,"Far hast thou wandered to and fro."""
23608,BOOK II.,
23609,BOOK II.,"Thus Sítá spake in gentle tone,"
23610,BOOK II.,"And went obedient to the stone,"
23611,BOOK II.,Of perfect face and faultless limb
23612,BOOK II.,Prepared to rest a while with him.
23613,BOOK II.,"And Ráma, as she thus replied,"
23614,BOOK II.,Turned to his spouse again and cried:
23615,BOOK II.,"""Thou seest, love, this flowery shade"
23616,BOOK II.,"For silvan creatures' pleasure made,"
23617,BOOK II.,How the gum streams from trees and plants
23618,BOOK II.,Torn by the tusks of elephants!
23619,BOOK II.,Through all the forest clear and high
23620,BOOK II.,Resounds the shrill cicala's cry.
23621,BOOK II.,"Hark how the kite above us moans,"
23622,BOOK II.,And calls her young in piteous tones;
23623,BOOK II.,So may my hapless mother be
23624,BOOK II.,Still mourning in her home for me.
23625,BOOK II.,There mounted on that lofty Sál
23626,BOOK II.,The loud Bhringráj(375) repeats his call:
23627,BOOK II.,How sweetly now he tunes his throat
23628,BOOK II.,Responsive to the Koďl's note.
23629,BOOK II.,Or else the bird that now has sung
23630,BOOK II.,"May be himself the Koďl's young,"
23631,BOOK II.,Linked with such winning sweetness are
23632,BOOK II.,The notes he pours irregular.
23633,BOOK II.,"See, round the blooming Mango clings"
23634,BOOK II.,"That creeper with her tender rings,"
23635,BOOK II.,"So in thy love, when none is near,"
23636,BOOK II.,"Thine arms are thrown round me, my dear."""
23637,BOOK II.,
23638,BOOK II.,"Thus in his joy he cried; and she,"
23639,BOOK II.,"Sweet speaker, on her lover's knee,"
23640,BOOK II.,"Of faultless limb and perfect face,"
23641,BOOK II.,Grew closer to her lord's embrace.
23642,BOOK II.,"Reclining in her husband's arms,"
23643,BOOK II.,"A goddess in her wealth of charms,"
23644,BOOK II.,She filled his loving breast anew
23645,BOOK II.,With mighty joy that thrilled him through.
23646,BOOK II.,"His finger on the rock he laid,"
23647,BOOK II.,"Which veins of sanguine ore displayed,"
23648,BOOK II.,And painted o'er his darling's eyes
23649,BOOK II.,The holy sign in mineral dyes.
23650,BOOK II.,Bright on her brow the metal lay
23651,BOOK II.,"Like the young sun's first gleaming ray,"
23652,BOOK II.,And showed her in her beauty fair
23653,BOOK II.,As the soft light of morning's air.
23654,BOOK II.,Then from the Kesar's laden tree
23655,BOOK II.,"He picked fair blossoms in his glee,"
23656,BOOK II.,"And as he decked each lovely tress,"
23657,BOOK II.,His heart o'erflowed with happiness.
23658,BOOK II.,So resting on that rocky seat
23659,BOOK II.,"A while they spent in pastime sweet,"
23660,BOOK II.,Then onward neath the shady boughs
23661,BOOK II.,Went Ráma with his Maithil spouse.
23662,BOOK II.,She roaming in the forest shade
23663,BOOK II.,Where every kind of creature strayed
23664,BOOK II.,"Observed a monkey wandering near,"
23665,BOOK II.,And clung to Ráma's arm in fear.
23666,BOOK II.,The hero Ráma fondly laced
23667,BOOK II.,"His mighty arms around her waist,"
23668,BOOK II.,"Consoled his beauty in her dread,"
23669,BOOK II.,And scared the Monkey till he fled.
23670,BOOK II.,That holy mark of sanguine ore
23671,BOOK II.,"That gleamed on Sítá's brow before,"
23672,BOOK II.,Shone by that close embrace impressed
23673,BOOK II.,Upon the hero's ample chest.
23674,BOOK II.,"Then Sítá, when the beast who led"
23675,BOOK II.,"The monkey troop, afar had fled,"
23676,BOOK II.,Laughed loudly in light-hearted glee
23677,BOOK II.,That mark on Ráma's chest to see.
23678,BOOK II.,A clump of bright Asokas fired
23679,BOOK II.,The forest in their bloom attired:
23680,BOOK II.,The restless blossoms as they gleamed
23681,BOOK II.,A host of threatening monkeys seemed.
23682,BOOK II.,"Then Sítá thus to Ráma cried,"
23683,BOOK II.,As longingly the flowers she eyed:
23684,BOOK II.,"""Pride of thy race, now let us go"
23685,BOOK II.,"Where those Asoka blossoms grow."""
23686,BOOK II.,He on his darling's pleasure bent
23687,BOOK II.,With his fair goddess thither went
23688,BOOK II.,And roamed delighted through the wood
23689,BOOK II.,"Where blossoming Asokas stood,"
23690,BOOK II.,As Siva with Queen Umá roves
23691,BOOK II.,Through Himaván's majestic groves.
23692,BOOK II.,Bright with purpureal glow the pair
23693,BOOK II.,"Of happy lovers sported there,"
23694,BOOK II.,And each upon the other set
23695,BOOK II.,A flower-inwoven coronet.
23696,BOOK II.,There many a crown and chain they wove
23697,BOOK II.,"Of blooms from that Asoka grove,"
23698,BOOK II.,And in their graceful sport the two
23699,BOOK II.,Fresh beauty o'er the mountain threw.
23700,BOOK II.,The lover let his love survey
23701,BOOK II.,"Each pleasant spot that round them lay,"
23702,BOOK II.,Then turned they to their green retreat
23703,BOOK II.,"Where all was garnished, gay, and neat."
23704,BOOK II.,"By brotherly affection led,"
23705,BOOK II.,"Sumitrá's son to meet them sped,"
23706,BOOK II.,And showed the labours of the day
23707,BOOK II.,Done while his brother was away.
23708,BOOK II.,There lay ten black-deer duly slain
23709,BOOK II.,"With arrows pure of poison stain,"
23710,BOOK II.,"Piled in a mighty heap to dry,"
23711,BOOK II.,With many another carcass nigh.
23712,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman's brother saw, o'erjoyed,"
23713,BOOK II.,"The work that had his hands employed,"
23714,BOOK II.,Then to his consort thus he cried:
23715,BOOK II.,"""Now be the general gifts supplied."""
23716,BOOK II.,"Then Sítá, fairest beauty, placed"
23717,BOOK II.,"The food for living things to taste,"
23718,BOOK II.,And set before the brothers meat
23719,BOOK II.,And honey that the pair might eat.
23720,BOOK II.,"They ate the meal her hands supplied,"
23721,BOOK II.,Their lips with water purified:
23722,BOOK II.,Then Janak's daughter sat at last
23723,BOOK II.,And duly made her own repast.
23724,BOOK II.,"The other venison, to be dried,"
23725,BOOK II.,"Piled up in heaps was set aside,"
23726,BOOK II.,And Ráma told his wife to stay
23727,BOOK II.,And drive the flocking crows away.
23728,BOOK II.,Her husband saw her much distressed
23729,BOOK II.,"By one more bold than all the rest,"
23730,BOOK II.,"Whose wings where'er he chose could fly,"
23731,BOOK II.,"Now pierce the earth, now roam the sky."
23732,BOOK II.,Then Ráma laughed to see her stirred
23733,BOOK II.,To anger by the plaguing bird:
23734,BOOK II.,Proud of his love the beauteous dame
23735,BOOK II.,With burning rage was all aflame.
23736,BOOK II.,"Now here, now there, again, again"
23737,BOOK II.,"She chased the crow, but all in vain,"
23738,BOOK II.,"Enraging her, so quick to strike"
23739,BOOK II.,With beak and wing and claw alike:
23740,BOOK II.,"Then how the proud lip quivered, how"
23741,BOOK II.,The dark frown marked her angry brow!
23742,BOOK II.,When Ráma saw her cheek aglow
23743,BOOK II.,"With passion, he rebuked the crow."
23744,BOOK II.,"But bold in impudence the bird,"
23745,BOOK II.,"With no respect for Ráma's word,"
23746,BOOK II.,Fearless again at Sítá flew:
23747,BOOK II.,Then Ráma's wrath to fury grew.
23748,BOOK II.,The hero of the mighty arm
23749,BOOK II.,"Spoke o'er a shaft the mystic charm,"
23750,BOOK II.,Laid the dire weapon on his bow
23751,BOOK II.,And launched it at the shameless crow.
23752,BOOK II.,"The bird, empowered by Gods to spring"
23753,BOOK II.,"Through earth itself on rapid wing,"
23754,BOOK II.,Through the three worlds in terror fled
23755,BOOK II.,Still followed by that arrow dread.
23756,BOOK II.,"Where'er he flew, now here now there,"
23757,BOOK II.,A cloud of weapons filled the air.
23758,BOOK II.,Back to the high-souled prince he fled
23759,BOOK II.,"And bent at Ráma's feet his head,"
23760,BOOK II.,"And then, as Sítá looked, began"
23761,BOOK II.,His speech in accents of a man:
23762,BOOK II.,"""O pardon, and for pity's sake"
23763,BOOK II.,"Spare, Ráma, spare my life to take!"
23764,BOOK II.,"Where'er I turn, where'er I flee,"
23765,BOOK II.,"No shelter from this shaft I see."""
23766,BOOK II.,
23767,BOOK II.,The chieftain heard the crow entreat
23768,BOOK II.,"Helpless and prostrate at his feet,"
23769,BOOK II.,"And while soft pity moved his breast,"
23770,BOOK II.,With wisest speech the bird addressed:
23771,BOOK II.,"""I took the troubled Sítá's part,"
23772,BOOK II.,And furious anger filled my heart.
23773,BOOK II.,Then on the string my arrow lay
23774,BOOK II.,Charmed with a spell thy life to slay.
23775,BOOK II.,"Thou seekest now my feet, to crave"
23776,BOOK II.,Forgiveness and thy life to save.
23777,BOOK II.,So shall thy prayer have due respect:
23778,BOOK II.,The suppliant I must still protect.
23779,BOOK II.,But ne'er in vain this dart may flee;
23780,BOOK II.,"Yield for thy life a part of thee,"
23781,BOOK II.,"What portion of thy body, say,"
23782,BOOK II.,Shall this mine arrow rend away?
23783,BOOK II.,"Thus far, O bird, thus far alone"
23784,BOOK II.,On thee my pity may be shown.
23785,BOOK II.,Forfeit a part thy life to buy:
23786,BOOK II.,"'Tis better so to live than die."""
23787,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma spoke: the bird of air
23788,BOOK II.,"Pondered his speech with anxious care,"
23789,BOOK II.,And wisely deemed it good to give
23790,BOOK II.,One of his eyes that he might live.
23791,BOOK II.,To Raghu's son he made reply:
23792,BOOK II.,"""O Ráma, I will yield an eye."
23793,BOOK II.,So let me in thy grace confide
23794,BOOK II.,"And live hereafter single-eyed."""
23795,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma charged the shaft, and lo,"
23796,BOOK II.,Full in the eye it smote the crow.
23797,BOOK II.,And the Videhan lady gazed
23798,BOOK II.,Upon the ruined eye amazed.
23799,BOOK II.,"The crow to Ráma humbly bent,"
23800,BOOK II.,Then where his fancy led he went.
23801,BOOK II.,Ráma with Lakshman by his side
23802,BOOK II.,With needful work was occupied.

23809,BOOK II.,
23810,BOOK II.,Thus Ráma showed his love the rill
23811,BOOK II.,"Whose waters ran beneath the hill,"
23812,BOOK II.,Then resting on his mountain seat
23813,BOOK II.,Refreshed her with the choicest meat.
23814,BOOK II.,So there reposed the happy two:
23815,BOOK II.,Then Bharat's army nearer drew:
23816,BOOK II.,"Rose to the skies a dusty cloud,"
23817,BOOK II.,The sound of trampling feet was loud.
23818,BOOK II.,The swelling roar of marching men
23819,BOOK II.,"Drove the roused tiger from his den,"
23820,BOOK II.,And scared amain the serpent race
23821,BOOK II.,Flying to hole and hiding-place.
23822,BOOK II.,"The herds of deer in terror fled,"
23823,BOOK II.,"The air was filled with birds o'erhead,"
23824,BOOK II.,"The bear began to leave his tree,"
23825,BOOK II.,The monkey to the cave to flee.
23826,BOOK II.,Wild elephants were all amazed
23827,BOOK II.,As though the wood around them blazed.
23828,BOOK II.,"The lion oped his ponderous jaw,"
23829,BOOK II.,The buffalo looked round in awe.
23830,BOOK II.,"The prince, who heard the deafening sound,"
23831,BOOK II.,And saw the silvan creatures round
23832,BOOK II.,"Fly wildly startled from their rest,"
23833,BOOK II.,The glorious Lakshman thus addressed:
23834,BOOK II.,"""Sumitrá's noble son most dear,"
23835,BOOK II.,"Hark, Lakshman, what a roar I hear,"
23836,BOOK II.,"The tumult of a coming crowd,"
23837,BOOK II.,"Appalling, deafening, deep, and loud!"
23838,BOOK II.,The din that yet more fearful grows
23839,BOOK II.,"Scares elephants and buffaloes,"
23840,BOOK II.,"Or frightened by the lions, deer"
23841,BOOK II.,Are flying through the wood in fear.
23842,BOOK II.,I fain would know who seeks this place
23843,BOOK II.,Comes prince or monarch for the chase?
23844,BOOK II.,Or does some mighty beast of prey
23845,BOOK II.,Frighten the silvan herds away?
23846,BOOK II.,"'Tis hard to reach this mountain height,"
23847,BOOK II.,"Yea, e'en for birds in airy flight."
23848,BOOK II.,"Then fain, O Lakshman, would I know"
23849,BOOK II.,"What cause disturbs the forest so."""
23850,BOOK II.,
23851,BOOK II.,"Lakshman in haste, the wood to view,"
23852,BOOK II.,"Climbed a high Sál that near him grew,"
23853,BOOK II.,"The forest all around he eyed,"
23854,BOOK II.,First gazing on the eastern side.
23855,BOOK II.,Then northward when his eyes he bent
23856,BOOK II.,He saw a mighty armament
23857,BOOK II.,"Of elephants, and cars, and horse,"
23858,BOOK II.,"And men on foot, a mingled force,"
23859,BOOK II.,"And banners waving in the breeze,"
23860,BOOK II.,And spoke to Ráma words like these:
23861,BOOK II.,"""Quick, quick, my lord, put out the fire,"
23862,BOOK II.,Let Sítá to the cave retire.
23863,BOOK II.,"Thy coat of mail around thee throw,"
23864,BOOK II.,"Prepare thine arrows and thy bow."""
23865,BOOK II.,
23866,BOOK II.,"In eager haste thus Lakshman cried,"
23867,BOOK II.,"And Ráma, lion lord, replied:"
23868,BOOK II.,"""Still closer be the army scanned,"
23869,BOOK II.,"And say who leads the warlike band."""
23870,BOOK II.,"Lakshman his answer thus returned,"
23871,BOOK II.,"As furious rage within him burned,"
23872,BOOK II.,Exciting him like kindled fire
23873,BOOK II.,To scorch the army in his ire:
23874,BOOK II.,"""'Tis Bharat: he has made the throne"
23875,BOOK II.,By consecrating rites his own:
23876,BOOK II.,To gain the whole dominion thus
23877,BOOK II.,He comes in arms to slaughter us.
23878,BOOK II.,I mark tree-high upon his car
23879,BOOK II.,"His flagstaff of the Kovidár,(376)"
23880,BOOK II.,"I see his glittering banner glance,"
23881,BOOK II.,I see his chivalry advance:
23882,BOOK II.,I see his eager warriors shine
23883,BOOK II.,On elephants in lengthened line.
23884,BOOK II.,"Now grasp we each the shafts and bow,"
23885,BOOK II.,And higher up the mountain go.
23886,BOOK II.,"Or in this place, O hero, stand"
23887,BOOK II.,With weapons in each ready hand.
23888,BOOK II.,Perhaps beneath our might may fall
23889,BOOK II.,"This leader of the standard tall,"
23890,BOOK II.,And Bharat I this day may see
23891,BOOK II.,"Who brought this mighty woe on thee,"
23892,BOOK II.,"Sítá, and me, who drove away"
23893,BOOK II.,My brother from the royal sway.
23894,BOOK II.,"Bharat our foe at length is nigh,"
23895,BOOK II.,And by this hand shall surely die:
23896,BOOK II.,"Brother, I see no sin at all"
23897,BOOK II.,If Bharat by my weapon fall.
23898,BOOK II.,No fault is his who slays the foe
23899,BOOK II.,Whose hand was first to strike the blow:
23900,BOOK II.,With Bharat now the crime begins
23901,BOOK II.,Who against thee and duty sins.
23902,BOOK II.,The queen athirst for royal sway
23903,BOOK II.,Will see her darling son to-day
23904,BOOK II.,"Fall by this hand, like some fair tree"
23905,BOOK II.,"Struck by an elephant, slain by me."
23906,BOOK II.,Kaikeyí's self shall perish too
23907,BOOK II.,"With kith and kin and retinue,"
23908,BOOK II.,And earth by my avenging deed
23909,BOOK II.,Shall from this mass of sin be freed.
23910,BOOK II.,"This day my wrath, too long restrained,"
23911,BOOK II.,"Shall fall upon the foe, unchained,"
23912,BOOK II.,Mad as the kindled flame that speeds
23913,BOOK II.,Destroying through the grass and reeds.
23914,BOOK II.,This day mine arrows keen and fierce
23915,BOOK II.,The bodies of the foe shall pierce:
23916,BOOK II.,The woods on Chitrakúta's side
23917,BOOK II.,Shall run with torrents crimson-dyed.
23918,BOOK II.,The wandering beasts of prey shall feed
23919,BOOK II.,"On heart-cleft elephant and steed,"
23920,BOOK II.,And drag to mountain caves away
23921,BOOK II.,The bodies that my arrows slay.
23922,BOOK II.,Doubt not that Bharat and his train
23923,BOOK II.,Shall in this mighty wood be slain:
23924,BOOK II.,So shall I pay the debt my bow
23925,BOOK II.,"And these my deadly arrows owe."""

23931,BOOK II.,

23934,BOOK II.,The wrath that Lakshman's bosom swayed:
23935,BOOK II.,"""What need have we the sword to wield,"
23936,BOOK II.,"To bend the bow or lift the shield,"
23937,BOOK II.,"If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,"
23938,BOOK II.,Himself has sought this sheltering wood?
23939,BOOK II.,"I sware my father's will to do,"
23940,BOOK II.,And if I now my brother slew
23941,BOOK II.,"What gain in kingship should I find,"
23942,BOOK II.,Despised and scorned by all mankind?
23943,BOOK II.,"Believe me, e'en as I would shrink"
23944,BOOK II.,"From poisoned meat or deadly drink,"
23945,BOOK II.,No power or treasure would I win
23946,BOOK II.,By fall of friend or kith or kin.
23947,BOOK II.,"Brother, believe the words I speak:"
23948,BOOK II.,For your dear sakes alone I seek
23949,BOOK II.,"Duty and pleasure, wealth and gain:"
23950,BOOK II.,"A holy life, a happy reign."
23951,BOOK II.,"If royal sway my heart desires,"
23952,BOOK II.,My brothers' weal the wish inspires:
23953,BOOK II.,"Their bliss and safety is my care,"
23954,BOOK II.,By this uplifted bow I swear.
23955,BOOK II.,'Twere not so hard for me to gain
23956,BOOK II.,"This broad land girdled by the main,"
23957,BOOK II.,But even Indra's royal might
23958,BOOK II.,Should ne'er be mine in duty's spite.

23963,BOOK II.,"Far dearer than this life of mine,"
23964,BOOK II.,"Knowing the custom of our line,"
23965,BOOK II.,"His heart with fond affection fraught,"
23966,BOOK II.,Bharat Ayodhyá's town resought

23968,BOOK II.,"With thee and Sítá, forced to fly"
23969,BOOK II.,With matted hair and hermit dress
23970,BOOK II.,Am wandering in the wilderness.

23973,BOOK II.,"From every thought of evil clear,"
23974,BOOK II.,Is come to meet his brother here.
23975,BOOK II.,Some grievous words perchance he spoke
23976,BOOK II.,"Kaikeyí's anger to provoke,"
23977,BOOK II.,"Then won the king, and comes to lay"

23979,BOOK II.,"Hither, methinks, in season due"
23980,BOOK II.,"Comes Bharat for an interview,"
23981,BOOK II.,Nor in his secret heart has he
23982,BOOK II.,One evil thought 'gainst thee or me.
23983,BOOK II.,"What has he done ere now, reflect!"
23984,BOOK II.,How failed in love or due respect
23985,BOOK II.,To make thee doubt his faith and lay
23986,BOOK II.,This evil to his charge to-day?
23987,BOOK II.,Thou shouldst not join with Bharat's name
23988,BOOK II.,So harsh a speech and idle blame.

23990,BOOK II.,My sympathizing bosom feels.

24001,BOOK II.,

24003,BOOK II.,"Was duty, and to aid the right:"
24004,BOOK II.,"And Lakshman keenly felt the blame,"
24005,BOOK II.,And shrank within himself for shame:
24006,BOOK II.,"And then his answer thus returned,"
24007,BOOK II.,With downcast eye and cheek that burned:
24008,BOOK II.,"""Brother, I ween, to see thy face"
24009,BOOK II.,"Our sire himself has sought this place."""
24010,BOOK II.,"Thus Lakshman spoke and stood ashamed,"
24011,BOOK II.,And Ráma saw and thus exclaimed:
24012,BOOK II.,"""It is the strong-armed monarch: he"
24013,BOOK II.,"Is come, methinks, his sons to see,"
24014,BOOK II.,To bid us both the forest quit
24015,BOOK II.,For joys for which he deems us fit:
24016,BOOK II.,"He thinks on all our care and pain,"
24017,BOOK II.,And now would lead us home again.
24018,BOOK II.,My glorious father hence will bear
24019,BOOK II.,Sítá who claims all tender care.
24020,BOOK II.,"I see two coursers fleet as storms,"
24021,BOOK II.,Of noble breed and lovely forms.

24024,BOOK II.,"The aged Victor, march this way"
24025,BOOK II.,In front of all the armed array.
24026,BOOK II.,"But doubt and fear within me rise,"

24077,BOOK II.,With which the lotus petals vie;

24196,BOOK II.,"The brace to bind the bowman's arm,"
24197,BOOK II.,"The glove to shield his hand from harm,"

24203,BOOK II.,That to the north and east was turned.
24204,BOOK II.,Bharat his eager glances bent
24205,BOOK II.,And gazed within the cot intent;
24206,BOOK II.,"In deerskin dress, with matted hair,"
24207,BOOK II.,Ráma his chief was sitting there:
24208,BOOK II.,"With lion-shoulders broad and strong,"
24209,BOOK II.,"With lotus eyes, arms thick and long."
24210,BOOK II.,"The righteous sovereign, who should be"
24211,BOOK II.,"Lord paramount from sea to sea,"
24212,BOOK II.,"High-minded, born to lofty fate,"
24213,BOOK II.,Like Brahmá's self supremely great;
24214,BOOK II.,"With Lakshman by his side, and her,"
24215,BOOK II.,"Fair Sítá, for his minister."
24216,BOOK II.,"And Bharat gazing, overcome"
24217,BOOK II.,"By sorrow for a while was dumb,"
24218,BOOK II.,"Then, yielding to his woe, he ran"
24219,BOOK II.,To Ráma and with sobs began:
24220,BOOK II.,"""He who a royal seat should fill"
24221,BOOK II.,"With subjects round to do his will,"
24222,BOOK II.,"My elder brother,--see him here,"
24223,BOOK II.,With silvan creatures waiting near.
24224,BOOK II.,"The high-souled hero, wont to wear"
24225,BOOK II.,"The costliest robes exceeding fair,"
24226,BOOK II.,"Now banished, in a deerskin dress,"
24227,BOOK II.,Here keeps the path of righteousness.
24228,BOOK II.,How brooks the son of Raghu now
24229,BOOK II.,"The matted locks which load his brow,"
24230,BOOK II.,Around whose princely head were twined
24231,BOOK II.,Sweet blossoms of the rarest kind?
24232,BOOK II.,"The prince whose merits grew, acquired"
24233,BOOK II.,"By rites performed as he desired,"
24234,BOOK II.,Would now a store of merit gain
24235,BOOK II.,Bought by his body's toil and pain.
24236,BOOK II.,Those limbs to which pure sandal lent
24237,BOOK II.,"The freshness of its fragrant scent,"
24238,BOOK II.,"Exposed to sun, and dust, and rain,"
24239,BOOK II.,Are now defiled with many a stain.
24240,BOOK II.,And I the wretched cause why this
24241,BOOK II.,Falls on the prince whose right is bliss!
24242,BOOK II.,"Ah me, that ever I was born"

24246,BOOK II.,Great drops upon his forehead hung.
24247,BOOK II.,He fell o'erpowered--his grief was such--
24248,BOOK II.,Ere he his brother's feet could touch.
24249,BOOK II.,As on the glorious prince he gazed
24250,BOOK II.,In vain his broken voice he raised:
24251,BOOK II.,"""Dear lord""--through tears and sobbing came,"
24252,BOOK II.,The only words his lips could frame.
24253,BOOK II.,"And brave Satrughna wept aloud,"
24254,BOOK II.,As low at Ráma's feet he bowed.
24255,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, while his tears ran fast,"
24256,BOOK II.,His arms around his brothers cast.
24257,BOOK II.,"Guha, Sumantra came to meet"
24258,BOOK II.,The princes in their wild retreat.

24260,BOOK II.,Their greeting thus rejoice to pay
24261,BOOK II.,"To the dear Lord who brings the night,"
24262,BOOK II.,And the great God who rules the day.
24263,BOOK II.,"Then wept the dwellers of the shade,"

24292,BOOK II.,"Has dared to do a thing abhorred,"
24293,BOOK II.,"Left us, and grieving for his son,"
24294,BOOK II.,A home among the Gods has won.
24295,BOOK II.,My mother Queen Kaikeyí gave
24296,BOOK II.,"The order to the king her slave,"
24297,BOOK II.,And at the bidding of the dame
24298,BOOK II.,He wrought the sin which mars his fame.
24299,BOOK II.,"Athirst for sway, her hopes are crossed,"
24300,BOOK II.,"She mourns her son, her husband lost,"

24303,BOOK II.,"Now O my lord, forgive me all;"
24304,BOOK II.,Be gracious to thy lowly thrall:
24305,BOOK II.,"Anointed king, accept to-day"
24306,BOOK II.,"Like Indra's self, the royal sway."
24307,BOOK II.,"Be gracious, Prince, to lord and peer,"
24308,BOOK II.,And widowed queens who seek thee here
24309,BOOK II.,"Accept the kingdom thine by right,"
24310,BOOK II.,And so thy faithful friends delight.
24311,BOOK II.,Let the broad land no longer be
24312,BOOK II.,All widowed and forlorn of thee:
24313,BOOK II.,Let the full moon of autumn reign
24314,BOOK II.,Triumphant o'er the night again.
24315,BOOK II.,These lords and I before thee bend:
24316,BOOK II.,"O Ráma, to our prayer attend."

24323,BOOK II.,
24324,BOOK II.,"As weeping thus the hero prayed,"
24325,BOOK II.,His head at Ráma's feet he laid.
24326,BOOK II.,Like a mad elephant he sighed:
24327,BOOK II.,And Ráma gazed and thus replied:
24328,BOOK II.,"""How, brother, can a man of worth,"
24329,BOOK II.,"True to his vows, of noble birth--"
24330,BOOK II.,"A man like me, commit a sin"

24332,BOOK II.,"No slightest shade of fault I see,"
24333,BOOK II.,"O tamer of thy foes, in thee."
24334,BOOK II.,But ne'er shouldst thou in childish thought
24335,BOOK II.,The queen thy mother blame in aught.
24336,BOOK II.,"O brother wise and sinless, know"
24337,BOOK II.,"The sacred laws would have it so,"
24338,BOOK II.,That from good wife and son require
24339,BOOK II.,Obedience to their lord and sire.
24340,BOOK II.,"And we are all the king's, for thus"
24341,BOOK II.,The virtuous ever reckon us:

24344,BOOK II.,"His is the right, if he deem fit,"

24347,BOOK II.,"And deerskin, in the wood to dwell."
24348,BOOK II.,"And O remember, best of all"
24349,BOOK II.,"Who act as claims of duty call,"
24350,BOOK II.,"As to a virtuous sire is due,"
24351,BOOK II.,Such honour claims a mother too.
24352,BOOK II.,So they whose lives have ever been
24353,BOOK II.,"By duty led, the king and queen,"
24354,BOOK II.,"Said, ""Ráma, seek the forest shade:"""

24358,BOOK II.,I dressed in bark my days will spend
24359,BOOK II.,Where Dandak's forest wilds extend.
24360,BOOK II.,"So Dasaratha spoke, our king,"
24361,BOOK II.,His share to each apportioning

24613,BOOK II.,And then the way behind them traced.
24614,BOOK II.,"The ladies moving, faint and slow,"
24615,BOOK II.,"Saw the fair stream before them flow,"
24616,BOOK II.,And by the bank their steps were led
24617,BOOK II.,Which the two brothers visited.
24618,BOOK II.,Kausalyá with her faded cheek
24619,BOOK II.,"And weeping eyes began to speak,"
24620,BOOK II.,And thus in mournful tones addressed
24621,BOOK II.,The queen Sumitrá and the rest:
24622,BOOK II.,"""See in the wood the bank's descent,"
24623,BOOK II.,"Which the two orphan youths frequent,"
24624,BOOK II.,"Whose noble spirits never fall,"
24625,BOOK II.,"Though woes surround them, reft of all."
24626,BOOK II.,Thy son with love that never tires
24627,BOOK II.,Draws water hence which mine requires.
24628,BOOK II.,"This day, for lowly toil unfit,"
24629,BOOK II.,"His pious task thy son should quit."""
24630,BOOK II.,
24631,BOOK II.,"As on the long-eyed lady strayed,"
24632,BOOK II.,"On holy grass, whose points were laid"
24633,BOOK II.,"Directed to the southern sky,"
24634,BOOK II.,The funeral offering met her eye.
24635,BOOK II.,When Ráma's humble gift she spied
24636,BOOK II.,Thus to the queens Kausalyá cried:
24637,BOOK II.,"""The gift of Ráma's hand behold,"
24638,BOOK II.,"His tribute to the king high-souled,"
24639,BOOK II.,"Offered to him, as texts require,"
24640,BOOK II.,"Lord of Ikshváku's line, his sire!"
24641,BOOK II.,Not such I deem the funeral food
24642,BOOK II.,Of kings with godlike might endued.
24643,BOOK II.,"Can he who knew all pleasures, he"
24644,BOOK II.,"Who ruled the earth from sea to sea,"
24645,BOOK II.,"The mighty lord of monarchs, feed"
24646,BOOK II.,On Ingudí's extracted seed?
24647,BOOK II.,In all the world there cannot be
24648,BOOK II.,"A woe, I ween, more sad to see,"
24649,BOOK II.,Than that my glorious son should make
24650,BOOK II.,His funeral gift of such a cake.
24651,BOOK II.,The ancient text I oft have heard
24652,BOOK II.,This day is true in every word:

24654,BOOK II.,"To eat the food their children use.' """
24655,BOOK II.,
24656,BOOK II.,The ladies soothed the weeping dame:
24657,BOOK II.,"To Ráma's hermitage they came,"
24658,BOOK II.,And there the hero met their eyes
24659,BOOK II.,Like a God fallen from the skies.
24660,BOOK II.,"Him joyless, reft of all, they viewed,"
24661,BOOK II.,And tears their mournful eyes bedewed.
24662,BOOK II.,"The truthful hero left his seat,"
24663,BOOK II.,"And clasped the ladies' lotus feet,"
24664,BOOK II.,And they with soft hands brushed away
24665,BOOK II.,The dust that on his shoulders lay.
24666,BOOK II.,"Then Lakshman, when he saw each queen"
24667,BOOK II.,"With weeping eyes and troubled mien,"
24668,BOOK II.,Near to the royal ladies drew
24669,BOOK II.,And paid them gentle reverence too.
24670,BOOK II.,"He, Dasaratha's offspring, signed"
24671,BOOK II.,"The heir of bliss by Fortune kind,"
24672,BOOK II.,Received from every dame no less

24674,BOOK II.,And Sítá came and bent before
24675,BOOK II.,"The widows, while her eyes ran o'er,"
24676,BOOK II.,And pressed their feet with many a tear.
24677,BOOK II.,They when they saw the lady dear
24678,BOOK II.,"Pale, worn with dwelling in the wild,"
24679,BOOK II.,Embraced her as a darling child:
24680,BOOK II.,"""Daughter of royal Janak, bride"
24681,BOOK II.,"Of Dasaratha's son,"" they cried,"
24682,BOOK II.,"""How couldst thou, offspring of a king,"

24685,BOOK II.,Each sign of trouble on thy face--
24686,BOOK II.,"That lotus which the sun has dried,"
24687,BOOK II.,"That lily by the tempest tried,"
24688,BOOK II.,"That gold whereon the dust is spread,"

24693,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma, as she spoke distressed,"
24694,BOOK II.,"The feet of Saint Vasishtha pressed,"
24695,BOOK II.,"Touched them with reverential love,"
24696,BOOK II.,Then near him took his seat:

24705,BOOK II.,Bharat upon his brother gazed
24706,BOOK II.,"Whose glory shone like fire,"
24707,BOOK II.,As when the pure Mahendra bends
24708,BOOK II.,"To the great Lord of Life,"
24709,BOOK II.,Among his noble crowd of friends
24710,BOOK II.,This anxious thought was rife:
24711,BOOK II.,"""What words to Raghu's son to-day"

25026,BOOK II.,"""O thou whom Queen Kaikeyí bare"
25027,BOOK II.,"The best of kings, thy words are fair,"
25028,BOOK II.,"Our royal father, when of yore"
25029,BOOK II.,"He wed her, to her father swore"
25030,BOOK II.,"The best of kingdoms to confer,"
25031,BOOK II.,A noble dowry meet for her;
25032,BOOK II.,"Then, grateful, on the deadly day"
25033,BOOK II.,"Of heavenly Gods' and demons' fray,"
25034,BOOK II.,A future boon on her bestowed
25035,BOOK II.,To whose sweet care his life he owed.
25036,BOOK II.,"She to his mind that promise brought,"
25037,BOOK II.,And then the best of kings besought
25038,BOOK II.,"To bid me to the forest flee,"
25039,BOOK II.,"And give the rule, O Prince, to thee."
25040,BOOK II.,"Thus bound by oath, the king our lord"
25041,BOOK II.,"Gave her those boons of free accord,"
25042,BOOK II.,"And bade me, O thou chief of men,"
25043,BOOK II.,Live in the woods four years and ten.
25044,BOOK II.,I to this lonely wood have hied
25045,BOOK II.,"With faithful Lakshman by my side,"
25046,BOOK II.,"And Sítá by no tears deterred,"
25047,BOOK II.,Resolved to keep my father's word.
25048,BOOK II.,"And thou, my noble brother, too"
25049,BOOK II.,Shouldst keep our father's promise true:
25050,BOOK II.,Anointed ruler of the state
25051,BOOK II.,Maintain his word inviolate.
25052,BOOK II.,"From his great debt, dear brother, free"
25053,BOOK II.,"Our lord the king for love of me,"

25064,BOOK II.,"Thus numerous sons are sought by prayer,"
25065,BOOK II.,"In Scripture trained with graces fair,"

25067,BOOK II.,May funeral rites at Gayá pay.
25068,BOOK II.,The mighty saints who lived of old
25069,BOOK II.,This holy doctrine ever hold.

25108,BOOK II.,"Then virtuous Jáváli, chief"
25109,BOOK II.,"Of twice-born sages, thus replied"
25110,BOOK II.,In words that virtue's law defied:
25111,BOOK II.,"""Hail, Raghu's princely son, dismiss"
25112,BOOK II.,A thought so weak and vain as this.
25113,BOOK II.,"Canst thou, with lofty heart endowed,"
25114,BOOK II.,Think with the dull ignoble crowd?
25115,BOOK II.,For what are ties of kindred? can
25116,BOOK II.,One profit by a brother man?
25117,BOOK II.,"Alone the babe first opes his eyes,"
25118,BOOK II.,And all alone at last he dies.
25119,BOOK II.,"The man, I ween, has little sense"
25120,BOOK II.,Who looks with foolish reverence
25121,BOOK II.,On father's or on mother's name:
25122,BOOK II.,"In others, none a right may claim."
25123,BOOK II.,E'en as a man may leave his home
25124,BOOK II.,"And to a distant village roam,"
25125,BOOK II.,Then from his lodging turn away
25126,BOOK II.,"And journey on the following day,"
25127,BOOK II.,Such brief possession mortals hold
25128,BOOK II.,"In sire and mother, house and gold,"
25129,BOOK II.,And never will the good and wise
25130,BOOK II.,The brief uncertain lodging prize.
25131,BOOK II.,"Nor, best of men, shouldst thou disown"
25132,BOOK II.,"Thy sire's hereditary throne,"
25133,BOOK II.,And tread the rough and stony ground
25134,BOOK II.,"Where hardship, danger, woes abound."
25135,BOOK II.,"Come, let Ayodhyá rich and bright"
25136,BOOK II.,See thee enthroned with every rite:
25137,BOOK II.,Her tresses bound in single braid(387)
25138,BOOK II.,She waits thy coming long delayed.
25139,BOOK II.,"O come, thou royal Prince, and share"
25140,BOOK II.,"The kingly joys that wait thee there,"
25141,BOOK II.,And live in bliss transcending price
25142,BOOK II.,As Indra lives in Paradise.
25143,BOOK II.,"The parted king is naught to thee,"
25144,BOOK II.,Nor right in living man has he:

25155,BOOK II.,"With pious care, each solemn day,"

25183,BOOK II.,"Ráma of truthful hearts the best,"
25184,BOOK II.,With perfect skill and wisdom high
25185,BOOK II.,Thus to his speech made fit reply:
25186,BOOK II.,"""Thy words that tempt to bliss are fair,"
25187,BOOK II.,But virtue's garb they falsely wear.
25188,BOOK II.,For he from duty's path who strays
25189,BOOK II.,"To wander in forbidden ways,"
25190,BOOK II.,"Allured by doctrine false and vain,"
25191,BOOK II.,Praise from the good can never gain.
25192,BOOK II.,"Their lives the true and boaster show,"
25193,BOOK II.,"Pure and impure, and high and low,"

25195,BOOK II.,Stainless and stained and high and mean;

25197,BOOK II.,"Were but as they who lack them all,"
25198,BOOK II.,And those to virtuous thoughts inclined
25199,BOOK II.,Were but as men of evil mind.
25200,BOOK II.,If in the sacred name of right
25201,BOOK II.,I do this wrong in duty's spite;
25202,BOOK II.,"The path of virtue meanly quit,"
25203,BOOK II.,"And this polluting sin commit,"
25204,BOOK II.,What man who marks the bounds between
25205,BOOK II.,"Virtue and vice with insight keen,"

25215,BOOK II.,The subjects too their lives will mould.
25216,BOOK II.,That truth and mercy still must be
25217,BOOK II.,"Beloved of kings, is Heaven's decree."
25218,BOOK II.,"Upheld by truth the monarch reigns,"
25219,BOOK II.,And truth the very world sustains.
25220,BOOK II.,Truth evermore has been the love
25221,BOOK II.,"Of holy saints and Gods above,"
25222,BOOK II.,And he whose lips are truthful here
25223,BOOK II.,Wins after death the highest sphere.
25224,BOOK II.,"As from a serpent's deadly tooth,"
25225,BOOK II.,We shrink from him who scorns the truth.
25226,BOOK II.,For holy truth is root and spring
25227,BOOK II.,"Of justice and each holy thing,"
25228,BOOK II.,"A might that every power transcends,"
25229,BOOK II.,Linked to high bliss that never ends.
25230,BOOK II.,"Truth is all virtue's surest base,"

25233,BOOK II.,"Vows, sacrifice, and rites austere,"
25234,BOOK II.,"And Holy Writ, on truth depend:"
25235,BOOK II.,So men must still that truth defend.

25245,BOOK II.,Unharmed by my destructive hand:

25248,BOOK II.,Have we not heard that God and shade
25249,BOOK II.,Turn from the hated offerings paid

25251,BOOK II.,"No pledge can hold, no promise bind?"
25252,BOOK II.,"Truth is all duty: as the soul,"

25256,BOOK II.,The Warrior's duty I despise
25257,BOOK II.,That seeks the wrong in virtue's guise:
25258,BOOK II.,"Those claims I shrink from, which the base,"

25260,BOOK II.,"The heart conceives the guilty thought,"
25261,BOOK II.,"Then by the hand the sin is wrought,"

25413,BOOK II.,"Long time he strove, but forced to yield"
25414,BOOK II.,Fled from his kingdom and the field.
25415,BOOK II.,The wives he left had both conceived--

25506,BOOK II.,"To father, mother, holy guide."
25507,BOOK II.,"First to their sires their birth they owe,"
25508,BOOK II.,Nursed with maternal love they grow:
25509,BOOK II.,Their holy guides fair knowledge teach:

25519,BOOK II.,"O, for thine aged mother feel,"
25520,BOOK II.,Nor spurn the virtuous dame's appeal:
25521,BOOK II.,"Obey, O Prince, thy mother dear,"
25522,BOOK II.,And still to virtue's path adhere.

25713,BOOK II.,And lovely as the young moon's light:
25714,BOOK II.,"""Put, noble brother, I entreat,"

25727,BOOK II.,"With fruit and roots my life sustain,"

25736,BOOK II.,
25737,BOOK II.,Then Ráma to his bosom drew
25738,BOOK II.,Dear Bharat and Satrughna too:
25739,BOOK II.,"""Be never wroth,"" he cried, ""with her,"

25751,BOOK II.,And on the monster's mighty head
25752,BOOK II.,Those sandals duly bound.
25753,BOOK II.,"Then noble Ráma, born to swell"
25754,BOOK II.,"The glories of his race,"
25755,BOOK II.,To all in order bade farewell
25756,BOOK II.,With love and tender grace--
25757,BOOK II.,"To brothers, counsellers, and peers,--"
25758,BOOK II.,"Still firm, in duty proved,"
25759,BOOK II.,"Firm, as the Lord of Snow uprears"

25761,BOOK II.,"No queen, for choking sobs and sighs,"
25762,BOOK II.,Could say her last adieu:

25788,BOOK II.,And when the chieftain bold and sage
25789,BOOK II.,"Had reached that holy hermitage,"
25790,BOOK II.,Down from the car he sprang to greet
25791,BOOK II.,"The saint, and bowed before his feet."
25792,BOOK II.,"High rapture filled the hermit's breast,"
25793,BOOK II.,Who thus the royal prince addressed:
25794,BOOK II.,"""Say, Bharat, is thy duty done?"
25795,BOOK II.,"Hast thou with Ráma met, my son?"""
25796,BOOK II.,
25797,BOOK II.,The chief whose soul to virtue clave
25798,BOOK II.,This answer to the hermit gave:
25799,BOOK II.,"""I prayed him with our holy guide:"
25800,BOOK II.,"But Raghu's son our prayer denied,"
25801,BOOK II.,And long besought by both of us

25803,BOOK II.,"""True to my vow, I still will be"
25804,BOOK II.,Observant of my sire's decree:
25805,BOOK II.,Till fourteen years complete their course
25806,BOOK II.,"That promise shall remain in force."""
25807,BOOK II.,"The saint in highest wisdom taught,"
25808,BOOK II.,"These solemn words with wisdom fraught,"
25809,BOOK II.,To him in lore of language learned
25810,BOOK II.,Most eloquent himself returned:
25811,BOOK II.,"""Obey my rede: let Bharat hold"
25812,BOOK II.,This pair of sandals decked with gold:
25813,BOOK II.,They in Ayodhyá shall ensure
25814,BOOK II.,"Our welfare, and our bliss secure."""
25815,BOOK II.,When Ráma heard the royal priest
25816,BOOK II.,"He rose, and looking to the east"
25817,BOOK II.,Consigned the sandals to my hand
25818,BOOK II.,That they for him might guard the land.
25819,BOOK II.,Then from the high-souled chief's abode
25820,BOOK II.,"I turned upon my homeward road,"
25821,BOOK II.,"Dismissed by him, and now this pair"
25822,BOOK II.,"Of sandals to Ayodhyá bear."""
25823,BOOK II.,
25824,BOOK II.,"To him the hermit thus replied,"
25825,BOOK II.,By Bharat's tidings gratified:
25826,BOOK II.,"""No marvel thoughts so just and true,"
25827,BOOK II.,"Thou best of all who right pursue,"
25828,BOOK II.,"Should dwell in thee, O Prince of men,"
25829,BOOK II.,As waters gather in the glen.
25830,BOOK II.,"He is not dead, we mourn in vain:"
25831,BOOK II.,"Thy blessed father lives again,"
25832,BOOK II.,Whose noble son we thus behold
25833,BOOK II.,"Like Virtue's self in human mould."""
25834,BOOK II.,
25835,BOOK II.,He ceased: before him Bharat fell
25836,BOOK II.,"To clasp his feet, and said farewell:"
25837,BOOK II.,"His reverent steps around him bent,"
25838,BOOK II.,And onward to Ayodhyá went.

25850,BOOK II.,His host and royal retinue.
25851,BOOK II.,"His onward way he thence pursued,"
25852,BOOK II.,And soon renowned Ayodhyá viewed.
25853,BOOK II.,Then burnt by woe and sad of cheer
25854,BOOK II.,Bharat addressed the charioteer:
25855,BOOK II.,"""Ah, see, Ayodhyá dark and sad,"
25856,BOOK II.,"Her glory gone, once bright and glad:"

25868,BOOK II.,Whirled by his mettled coursers fast
25869,BOOK II.,Within Ayodhyá's city passed.
25870,BOOK II.,There dark and drear was every home
25871,BOOK II.,"Where cats and owls had space to roam,"
25872,BOOK II.,As when the shades of midnight fall
25873,BOOK II.,"With blackest gloom, and cover all:"
25874,BOOK II.,"As Rohiní, dear spouse of him"
25875,BOOK II.,"Whom Ráhu hates,(396) grows faint and dim,"
25876,BOOK II.,"When, as she shines on high alone"
25877,BOOK II.,The demon's shade is o'er her thrown:
25878,BOOK II.,As burnt by summer's heat a rill
25879,BOOK II.,"Scarce trickling from her parent hill,"
25880,BOOK II.,"With dying fish in pools half dried,"
25881,BOOK II.,And fainting birds upon her side:
25882,BOOK II.,As sacrificial flames arise
25883,BOOK II.,"When holy oil their food supplies,"
25884,BOOK II.,But when no more the fire is fed
25885,BOOK II.,Sink lustreless and cold and dead:
25886,BOOK II.,"Like some brave host that filled the plain,"
25887,BOOK II.,"With harness rent and captains slain,"
25888,BOOK II.,"When warrior, elephant, and steed"
25889,BOOK II.,Mingled in wild confusion bleed:
25890,BOOK II.,"As when, all spent her store of worth,"
25891,BOOK II.,Rocks from her base the loosened earth:
25892,BOOK II.,Like a sad fallen star no more
25893,BOOK II.,Wearing the lovely light it wore:
25894,BOOK II.,So mournful in her lost estate
25895,BOOK II.,Was that sad town disconsolate.
25896,BOOK II.,"Then car-borne Bharat, good and brave,"
25897,BOOK II.,Thus spake to him the steeds who drave:
25898,BOOK II.,"""Why are Ayodhyá's streets so mute?"
25899,BOOK II.,Where is the voice of lyre and lute?
25900,BOOK II.,"Why sounds not, as of old, to-day"
25901,BOOK II.,The music of the minstrel's lay?
25902,BOOK II.,Where are the wreaths they used to twine?
25903,BOOK II.,Where are the blossoms and the wine?
25904,BOOK II.,Where is the cool refreshing scent
25905,BOOK II.,Of sandal dust with aloe blent?
25906,BOOK II.,"The elephant's impatient roar,"
25907,BOOK II.,"The din of cars, I hear no more:"

25909,BOOK II.,Rings out to meet me on my way.
25910,BOOK II.,"Ayodhyá's youths, since Ráma's flight,"
25911,BOOK II.,Have lost their relish for delight:
25912,BOOK II.,"Her men roam forth no more, nor care"
25913,BOOK II.,Bright garlands round their necks to wear.
25914,BOOK II.,"All grieve for banished Ráma: feast,"
25915,BOOK II.,And revelry and song have ceased:
25916,BOOK II.,"Like a black night when floods pour down,"
25917,BOOK II.,So dark and gloomy is the town.
25918,BOOK II.,When will he come to make them gay
25919,BOOK II.,Like some auspicious holiday?

25922,BOOK II.,

25925,BOOK II.,"Like some deserted lion's den,"
25926,BOOK II.,Forsaken by the lord of men.
25927,BOOK II.,"Then to the inner bowers he came,"

25941,BOOK II.,"Lodged in her home each widowed queen,"
25942,BOOK II.,Still with his burning grief oppressed
25943,BOOK II.,His holy guides he thus addressed:
25944,BOOK II.,"""I go to Nandigrám: adieu,"
25945,BOOK II.,"This day, my lords to all of you:"
25946,BOOK II.,"I go, my load of grief to bear,"
25947,BOOK II.,"Reft of the son of Raghu, there."
25948,BOOK II.,"The king my sire, alas, is dead,"
25949,BOOK II.,And Ráma to the forest fled;
25950,BOOK II.,"There will I wait till he, restored,"
25951,BOOK II.,"Shall rule the realm, its rightful lord."""
25952,BOOK II.,
25953,BOOK II.,"They heard the high-souled prince's speech,"
25954,BOOK II.,And thus with ready answer each
25955,BOOK II.,"Of those great lords their chief addressed,"
25956,BOOK II.,With saint Vasishtha and the rest:
25957,BOOK II.,"""Good are the words which thou hast said,"
25958,BOOK II.,"By brotherly affection led,"
25959,BOOK II.,"Like thine own self, a faithful friend,"
25960,BOOK II.,True to thy brother to the end:
25961,BOOK II.,"A heart like thine must all approve,"
25962,BOOK II.,"Which naught from virtue's path can move."""
25963,BOOK II.,
25964,BOOK II.,Soon as the words he loved to hear
25965,BOOK II.,"Fell upon Bharat's joyful ear,"
25966,BOOK II.,Thus to the charioteer he spoke:
25967,BOOK II.,"""My car with speed, Sumantra, yoke."""
25968,BOOK II.,Then Bharat with delighted mien
25969,BOOK II.,"Obeisance paid to every queen,"
25970,BOOK II.,And with Satrughna by his side
25971,BOOK II.,Mounting the car away he hied.
25972,BOOK II.,"With lords, and priests in long array"
25973,BOOK II.,The brothers hastened on their way.
25974,BOOK II.,And the great pomp the Bráhmans led
25975,BOOK II.,With Saint Vasishtha at their head.
25976,BOOK II.,Then every face was eastward bent
25977,BOOK II.,As on to Nandigrám they went.
25978,BOOK II.,"Behind the army followed, all"
25979,BOOK II.,"Unsummoned by their leader's call,"
25980,BOOK II.,And steeds and elephants and men
25981,BOOK II.,Streamed forth with every citizen.
25982,BOOK II.,As Bharat in his chariot rode
25983,BOOK II.,"His heart with love fraternal glowed,"
25984,BOOK II.,And with the sandals on his head
25985,BOOK II.,To Nandigrám he quickly sped.
25986,BOOK II.,"Within the town he swiftly pressed,"
25987,BOOK II.,"Alighted, and his guides addressed:"
25988,BOOK II.,"""To me in trust my brother's hand"
25989,BOOK II.,"Consigned the lordship of the land,"
25990,BOOK II.,When he these gold-wrought sandals gave
25991,BOOK II.,"As emblems to protect and save."""
25992,BOOK II.,"Then Bharat bowed, and from his head"
25993,BOOK II.,"The sacred pledge deposited,"
25994,BOOK II.,And thus to all the people cried
25995,BOOK II.,Who ringed him round on every side:
25996,BOOK II.,"""Haste, for these sandals quickly bring"
25997,BOOK II.,The canopy that shades the king.
25998,BOOK II.,Pay ye to them all reverence meet
25999,BOOK II.,"As to my elder brother's feet,"
26000,BOOK II.,For they will right and law maintain
26001,BOOK II.,Until King Ráma come again.
26002,BOOK II.,My brother with a loving mind
26003,BOOK II.,These sandals to my charge consigned:
26004,BOOK II.,I till he come will guard with care
26005,BOOK II.,The sacred trust for Raghu's heir.
26006,BOOK II.,"My watchful task will soon be done,"
26007,BOOK II.,The pledge restored to Raghu's son;
26008,BOOK II.,"Then shall I see, his wanderings o'er,"
26009,BOOK II.,These sandals on his feet once more.
26010,BOOK II.,"My brother I shall meet at last,"
26011,BOOK II.,"The burthen from my shoulders cast,"
26012,BOOK II.,To Ráma's hand the realm restore
26013,BOOK II.,And serve my elder as before.
26014,BOOK II.,When Ráma takes again this pair
26015,BOOK II.,"Of sandals kept with pious care,"
26016,BOOK II.,"And here his glorious reign begins,"
26017,BOOK II.,"I shall be cleansed from all my sins,"
26018,BOOK II.,When the glad people's voices ring
26019,BOOK II.,"With welcome to the new-made king,"
26020,BOOK II.,Joy will be mine four-fold as great
26021,BOOK II.,"As if supreme I ruled the state."""
26022,BOOK II.,
26023,BOOK II.,Thus humbly spoke in sad lament
26024,BOOK II.,The chief in fame preëminent:
26025,BOOK II.,"Thus, by his reverent lords obeyed,"
26026,BOOK II.,At Nandigrám the kingdom swayed.
26027,BOOK II.,With hermit's dress and matted hair
26028,BOOK II.,He dwelt with all his army there.
26029,BOOK II.,The sandals of his brother's feet
26030,BOOK II.,"Installed upon the royal seat,"
26031,BOOK II.,"He, all his powers to them referred,"
26032,BOOK II.,Affairs of state administered.
26033,BOOK II.,"In every care, in every task,"
26034,BOOK II.,"When golden store was brought,"

26044,BOOK II.,When Bharat took his homeward road
26045,BOOK II.,Still Ráma in the wood abode:
26046,BOOK II.,But soon he marked the fear and care
26047,BOOK II.,That darkened all the hermits there.
26048,BOOK II.,For all who dwelt before the hill
26049,BOOK II.,Were sad with dread of coming ill:
26050,BOOK II.,"Each holy brow was lined by thought,"
26051,BOOK II.,And Ráma's side they often sought.
26052,BOOK II.,"With gathering frowns the prince they eyed,"
26053,BOOK II.,And then withdrew and talked aside.
26054,BOOK II.,
26055,BOOK II.,Then Raghu's son with anxious breast
26056,BOOK II.,The leader of the saints addressed:
26057,BOOK II.,"""Can aught that I have done displease,"
26058,BOOK II.,"O reverend Sage, the devotees?"
26059,BOOK II.,"Why are their loving looks, O say,"
26060,BOOK II.,Thus sadly changed or turned away?
26061,BOOK II.,Has Lakshman through his want of heed
26062,BOOK II.,Offended with unseemly deed?
26063,BOOK II.,"Or is the gentle Sítá, she"
26064,BOOK II.,Who loved to honour you and me--
26065,BOOK II.,"Is she the cause of this offence,"
26066,BOOK II.,"Failing in lowly reverence?"""
26067,BOOK II.,
26068,BOOK II.,"One sage, o'er whom, exceeding old,"
26069,BOOK II.,"Had many a year of penance rolled,"
26070,BOOK II.,Trembling in every aged limb
26071,BOOK II.,Thus for the rest replied to him:
26072,BOOK II.,"""How could we, O beloved, blame"
26073,BOOK II.,"Thy lofty-souled Videhan dame,"
26074,BOOK II.,"Who in the good of all delights,"
26075,BOOK II.,And more than all of anchorites?
26076,BOOK II.,But yet through thee a numbing dread
26077,BOOK II.,Of fiends among our band has spread;
26078,BOOK II.,Obstructed by the demons' art
26079,BOOK II.,The trembling hermits talk apart.
26080,BOOK II.,"For Rávan's brother, overbold,"
26081,BOOK II.,"Named Khara, of gigantic mould,"
26082,BOOK II.,Vexes with fury fierce and fell
26083,BOOK II.,All those in Janasthán(399) who dwell.
26084,BOOK II.,"Resistless in his cruel deeds,"
26085,BOOK II.,On flesh of men the monster feeds:
26086,BOOK II.,"Sinful and arrogant is he,"
26087,BOOK II.,And looks with special hate on thee.
26088,BOOK II.,"Since thou, beloved son, hast made"
26089,BOOK II.,"Thy home within this holy shade,"
26090,BOOK II.,The fiends have vexed with wilder rage
26091,BOOK II.,The dwellers of the hermitage.
26092,BOOK II.,In many a wild and dreadful form
26093,BOOK II.,"Around the trembling saints they swarm,"
26094,BOOK II.,With hideous shape and foul disguise
26095,BOOK II.,They terrify our holy eyes.
26096,BOOK II.,They make our loathing souls endure
26097,BOOK II.,"Insult and scorn and sights impure,"
26098,BOOK II.,And flocking round the altars stay
26099,BOOK II.,The holy rites we love to pay.
26100,BOOK II.,In every spot throughout the grove
26101,BOOK II.,"With evil thoughts the monsters rove,"
26102,BOOK II.,Assailing with their secret might
26103,BOOK II.,Each unsuspecting anchorite.
26104,BOOK II.,"Ladle and dish away they fling,"
26105,BOOK II.,"Our fires with floods extinguishing,"
26106,BOOK II.,And when the sacred flame should burn
26107,BOOK II.,They trample on each water-urn.
26108,BOOK II.,Now when they see their sacred wood
26109,BOOK II.,"Plagued by this impious brotherhood,"
26110,BOOK II.,The troubled saints away would roam
26111,BOOK II.,And seek in other shades a home:
26112,BOOK II.,"Hence will we fly, O Ráma, ere"
26113,BOOK II.,The cruel fiends our bodies tear.
26114,BOOK II.,Not far away a forest lies
26115,BOOK II.,"Rich in the roots and fruit we prize,"
26116,BOOK II.,To this will I and all repair
26117,BOOK II.,And join the holy hermits there;
26118,BOOK II.,"Be wise, and with us thither flee"
26119,BOOK II.,Before this Khara injure thee.
26120,BOOK II.,"Mighty art thou, O Ráma, yet"
26121,BOOK II.,Each day with peril is beset.
26122,BOOK II.,If with thy consort by thy side
26123,BOOK II.,"Thou in this wood wilt still abide."""
26124,BOOK II.,
26125,BOOK II.,He ceased: the words the hero spake
26126,BOOK II.,The hermit's purpose failed to break:
26127,BOOK II.,"To Raghu's son farewell he said,"
26128,BOOK II.,And blessed the chief and comforted;
26129,BOOK II.,Then with the rest the holy sage
26130,BOOK II.,Departed from the hermitage.
26131,BOOK II.,
26132,BOOK II.,"So from the wood the saints withdrew,"
26133,BOOK II.,And Ráma bidding all adieu
26134,BOOK II.,In lowly reverence bent:
26135,BOOK II.,"Instructed by their friendly speech,"
26136,BOOK II.,"Blest with the gracious love of each,"
26137,BOOK II.,To his pure home he went.
26138,BOOK II.,Nor would the son of Raghu stray
26139,BOOK II.,A moment from that grove away
26140,BOOK II.,From which the saints had fled.
26141,BOOK II.,And many a hermit thither came

26160,BOOK II.,"Have trampled through the calm retreat."""
26161,BOOK II.,"So forth to seek a home he hied,"
26162,BOOK II.,His spouse and Lakshman by his side.
26163,BOOK II.,"He came to Atri's pure retreat,"
26164,BOOK II.,"Paid reverence to his holy feet,"
26165,BOOK II.,And from the saint such welcome won
26166,BOOK II.,As a fond father gives his son.
26167,BOOK II.,The noble prince with joy unfeigned
26168,BOOK II.,"As a dear guest he entertained,"

26173,BOOK II.,"His blameless venerable spouse,"
26174,BOOK II.,"Delighting in her holy vows,"
26175,BOOK II.,Came from her chamber to his side:

26179,BOOK II.,"To Ráma next made known his wife,"

26183,BOOK II.,"She when the clouds withheld their rain,"
26184,BOOK II.,"And drought ten years consumed the plain,"
26185,BOOK II.,Caused grateful roots and fruit to grow
26186,BOOK II.,And ordered Gangá here to flow:
26187,BOOK II.,"So from their cares the saints she freed,"
26188,BOOK II.,"Nor let these checks their rites impede,"
26189,BOOK II.,"She wrought in Heaven's behalf, and made"
26190,BOOK II.,"Ten nights of one, the Gods to aid:(400)"

26197,BOOK II.,
26198,BOOK II.,"He ceased: and Ráma gave assent,"
26199,BOOK II.,"And said, with eyes on Sítá bent:"
26200,BOOK II.,"""O Princess, thou hast heard with me"
26201,BOOK II.,This counsel of the devotee:
26202,BOOK II.,"Now that her touch thy soul may bless,"
26203,BOOK II.,Approach the saintly votaress:
26204,BOOK II.,"Come to the venerable dame,"
26205,BOOK II.,Far known by Anasúyá's name:
26206,BOOK II.,The mighty things that she has done
26207,BOOK II.,"High glory in the world have won."""
26208,BOOK II.,
26209,BOOK II.,Thus spoke the son of Raghu: she
26210,BOOK II.,"Approached the saintly devotee,"
26211,BOOK II.,"Who with her white locks, old and frail,"
26212,BOOK II.,Shook like a plantain in the gale.
26213,BOOK II.,"To that true spouse she bowed her head,"
26214,BOOK II.,"And ""Lady, I am Sítá,"" said:"
26215,BOOK II.,Raised suppliant hands and prayed her tell

26269,BOOK II.,"Were he the meanest of the base,"
26270,BOOK II.,"Unhonoured with a single grace,"
26271,BOOK II.,"My husband still I ne'er would leave,"
26272,BOOK II.,But firm through all to him would cleave:
26273,BOOK II.,Still rather to a lord like mine
26274,BOOK II.,"Whose virtues high-exalted shine,"
26275,BOOK II.,"Compassionate, of lofty soul,"
26276,BOOK II.,"With every sense in due control,"
26277,BOOK II.,"True in his love, of righteous mind,"
26278,BOOK II.,Like a dear sire and mother kind.
26279,BOOK II.,E'en as he ever loves to treat
26280,BOOK II.,"Kausalyá with observance meet,"
26281,BOOK II.,Has his behaviour ever been
26282,BOOK II.,To every other honoured queen.
26283,BOOK II.,"Nay, more, a sonlike reverence shows"
26284,BOOK II.,The noble Ráma e'en to those
26285,BOOK II.,On whom the king his father set
26286,BOOK II.,"His eyes one moment, to forget."
26287,BOOK II.,"Deep in my heart the words are stored,"
26288,BOOK II.,"Said by the mother of my lord,"
26289,BOOK II.,When from my home I turned away
26290,BOOK II.,In the lone fearful woods to stray.
26291,BOOK II.,The counsel of my mother deep
26292,BOOK II.,"Impressed upon my soul I keep,"
26293,BOOK II.,"When by the fire I took my stand,"
26294,BOOK II.,And Ráma clasped in his my hand.
26295,BOOK II.,"And in my bosom cherished yet,"
26296,BOOK II.,My friends' advice I ne'er forget:
26297,BOOK II.,Woman her holiest offering pays
26298,BOOK II.,When she her husband's will obeys.
26299,BOOK II.,"Good Sávitrí her lord obeyed,"
26300,BOOK II.,"And a high saint in heaven was made,"
26301,BOOK II.,And for the self-same virtue thou
26302,BOOK II.,Hast heaven in thy possession now.
26303,BOOK II.,"And she with whom no dame could vie,"
26304,BOOK II.,"Now a bright Goddess in the sky,"
26305,BOOK II.,"Sweet Rohiní the Moon's dear Queen,"
26306,BOOK II.,Without her lord is never seen:
26307,BOOK II.,And many a faithful wife beside
26308,BOOK II.,"For her pure love is glorified."""
26309,BOOK II.,
26310,BOOK II.,Thus Sítá spake: soft rapture stole
26311,BOOK II.,Through Anasúyá's saintly soul:
26312,BOOK II.,"Kisses on Sítá's head she pressed,"
26313,BOOK II.,And thus the Maithil dame addressed:
26314,BOOK II.,"""I by long rites and toils endured"
26315,BOOK II.,Rich store of merit have secured:
26316,BOOK II.,From this my wealth will I bestow
26317,BOOK II.,A blessing ere I let thee go.
26318,BOOK II.,So right and wise and true each word
26319,BOOK II.,"That from thy lips mine ears have heard,"
26320,BOOK II.,I love thee: be my pleasing task
26321,BOOK II.,"To grant the boon that thou shalt ask."""
26322,BOOK II.,
26323,BOOK II.,"Then Sítá marvelled much, and while"
26324,BOOK II.,"Played o'er her lips a gentle smile,"
26325,BOOK II.,"""All has been done, O Saint,"" she cried,"
26326,BOOK II.,"""And naught remains to wish beside."""
26327,BOOK II.,
26328,BOOK II.,She spake; the lady's meek reply
26329,BOOK II.,Swelled Anasúyá's rapture high.
26330,BOOK II.,"""Sítá,"" she said, ""my gift to-day"
26331,BOOK II.,Thy sweet contentment shall repay.
26332,BOOK II.,"Accept this precious robe to wear,"
26333,BOOK II.,"Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare,"
26334,BOOK II.,"These gems thy limbs to ornament,"
26335,BOOK II.,This precious balsam sweet of scent.
26336,BOOK II.,"O Maithil dame, this gift of mine"
26337,BOOK II.,"Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine,"
26338,BOOK II.,And breathing o'er thy frame dispense
26339,BOOK II.,Its pure and lasting influence.
26340,BOOK II.,This balsam on thy fair limbs spread
26341,BOOK II.,"New radiance on thy lord shall shed,"
26342,BOOK II.,As Lakshmí's beauty lends a grace
26343,BOOK II.,"To Vishnu's own celestial face."""
26344,BOOK II.,
26345,BOOK II.,Then Sítá took the gift the dame
26346,BOOK II.,"Bestowed on her in friendship's name,"
26347,BOOK II.,"The balsam, gems, and robe divine,"
26348,BOOK II.,And garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;
26349,BOOK II.,"Then sat her down, with reverence meet,"
26350,BOOK II.,At saintly Anasúyá's feet.
26351,BOOK II.,The matron rich in rites and vows
26352,BOOK II.,"Turned her to Ráma's Maithil spouse,"
26353,BOOK II.,And questioned thus in turn to hear
26354,BOOK II.,A pleasant tale to charm her ear:
26355,BOOK II.,"""Sítá, 'tis said that Raghu's son"
26356,BOOK II.,"Thy hand, mid gathered suitors, won."
26357,BOOK II.,"I fain would hear thee, lady, tell"
26358,BOOK II.,The story as it all befell:
26359,BOOK II.,"Do thou repeat each thing that passed,"
26360,BOOK II.,"Reviewing all from first to last."""
26361,BOOK II.,
26362,BOOK II.,Thus spake the dame to Sítá: she
26363,BOOK II.,"Replying to the devotee,"
26364,BOOK II.,"""Then, lady, thy attention lend,"""
26365,BOOK II.,Rehearsed the story to the end:
26366,BOOK II.,
26367,BOOK II.,"""King Janak, just and brave and strong,"
26368,BOOK II.,"Who loves the right and hates the wrong,"
26369,BOOK II.,Well skilled in what the law ordains

26371,BOOK II.,"Guiding one morn the plough, his hand"
26372,BOOK II.,"Marked out, for rites the sacred land,"
26373,BOOK II.,"When, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,"
26374,BOOK II.,Child of the king I leapt to birth.
26375,BOOK II.,"Then as the ground he smoothed and cleared,"
26376,BOOK II.,"He saw me all with dust besmeared,"
26377,BOOK II.,"And on the new-found babe, amazed"
26378,BOOK II.,The ruler of Videha gazed.
26379,BOOK II.,In childless love the monarch pressed
26380,BOOK II.,The welcome infant to his breast:
26381,BOOK II.,"""My daughter,"" thus he cried, ""is she:"""
26382,BOOK II.,And as his child he cared for me.
26383,BOOK II.,Forth from the sky was heard o'erhead
26384,BOOK II.,As 'twere a human voice that said:
26385,BOOK II.,"""Yea, even so: great King, this child"
26386,BOOK II.,"Henceforth thine own be justly styled."""
26387,BOOK II.,"Videha's monarch, virtuous souled,"
26388,BOOK II.,"Rejoiced o'er me with joy untold,"
26389,BOOK II.,"Delighting in his new-won prize,"
26390,BOOK II.,The darling of his heart and eyes.
26391,BOOK II.,To his chief queen of saintly mind
26392,BOOK II.,"The precious treasure he consigned,"
26393,BOOK II.,"And by her side she saw me grow,"
26394,BOOK II.,Nursed with the love which mothers know.
26395,BOOK II.,"Then as he saw the seasons fly,"
26396,BOOK II.,"And knew my marriage-time was nigh,"
26397,BOOK II.,"My sire was vexed with care, as sad"
26398,BOOK II.,As one who mourns the wealth he had:
26399,BOOK II.,"""Scorn on the maiden's sire must wait"
26400,BOOK II.,From men of high and low estate:
26401,BOOK II.,"The virgin's father all despise,"

26406,BOOK II.,Like one whose shattered bark is lost.
26407,BOOK II.,"My father knowing how I came,"
26408,BOOK II.,"No daughter of a mortal dame,"
26409,BOOK II.,In all the regions failed to see
26410,BOOK II.,A bridegroom meet to match with me.
26411,BOOK II.,"Each way with anxious thought he scanned,"
26412,BOOK II.,And thus at length the monarch planned:
26413,BOOK II.,"""The Bride's Election will I hold,"
26414,BOOK II.,"With every rite prescribed of old."""
26415,BOOK II.,It pleased King Varun to bestow
26416,BOOK II.,Quiver and shafts and heavenly bow
26417,BOOK II.,"Upon my father's sire who reigned,"
26418,BOOK II.,When Daksha his great rite ordained.
26419,BOOK II.,Where was the man might bend or lift
26420,BOOK II.,With utmost toil that wondrous gift?
26421,BOOK II.,Not e'en in dreams could mortal king
26422,BOOK II.,Strain the great bow or draw the string.
26423,BOOK II.,"Of this tremendous bow possessed,"
26424,BOOK II.,My truthful father thus addressed
26425,BOOK II.,"The lords of many a region, all"
26426,BOOK II.,Assembled at the monarch's call:
26427,BOOK II.,"""Whoe'er this bow can manage, he"
26428,BOOK II.,"The husband of my child shall be."""
26429,BOOK II.,The suitors viewed with hopeless eyes
26430,BOOK II.,"That wondrous bow of mountain size,"
26431,BOOK II.,"Then to my sire they bade adieu,"
26432,BOOK II.,And all with humbled hearts withdrew.
26433,BOOK II.,At length with Visvámitra came
26434,BOOK II.,"This son of Raghu, dear to fame,"
26435,BOOK II.,The royal sacrifice to view.
26436,BOOK II.,"Near to my father's home he drew,"
26437,BOOK II.,"His brother Lakshman by his side,"
26438,BOOK II.,"Ráma, in deeds heroic tried."
26439,BOOK II.,My sire with honour entertained
26440,BOOK II.,"The saint in lore of duty trained,"
26441,BOOK II.,Who thus in turn addressed the king:
26442,BOOK II.,"""Ráma and Lakshman here who spring"
26443,BOOK II.,"From royal Dasaratha, long"
26444,BOOK II.,"To see thy bow so passing strong."""
26445,BOOK II.,
26446,BOOK II.,Before the prince's eyes was laid
26447,BOOK II.,"That marvel, as the Bráhman prayed."
26448,BOOK II.,"One moment on the bow he gazed,"
26449,BOOK II.,"Quick to the notch the string he raised,"
26450,BOOK II.,"Then, in the wandering people's view,"
26451,BOOK II.,The cord with mighty force he drew.
26452,BOOK II.,Then with an awful crash as loud
26453,BOOK II.,"As thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,"
26454,BOOK II.,The bow beneath the matchless strain
26455,BOOK II.,Of arms heroic snapped in twain.
26456,BOOK II.,"Thus, giving purest water, he,"
26457,BOOK II.,"My sire, to Ráma offered me."
26458,BOOK II.,The prince the offered gift declined
26459,BOOK II.,Till he should learn his father's mind;
26460,BOOK II.,So horsemen swift Ayodhyá sought
26461,BOOK II.,And back her aged monarch brought.
26462,BOOK II.,"Me then my sire to Ráma gave,"
26463,BOOK II.,"Self-ruled, the bravest of the brave."

26465,BOOK II.,"Graced with all gifts, most fair to see,"
26466,BOOK II.,"My sire with Raghu's house allied,"
26467,BOOK II.,And gave her to be Lakshman's bride.
26468,BOOK II.,Thus from the princes of the land

26487,BOOK II.,"But now the sun has sunk from sight,"
26488,BOOK II.,And left the world to holy Night.
26489,BOOK II.,Hark! how the leafy thickets sound
26490,BOOK II.,With gathering birds that twitter round:
26491,BOOK II.,"They sought their food by day, and all"
26492,BOOK II.,Flock homeward when the shadows fall.
26493,BOOK II.,"See, hither comes the hermit band,"

26499,BOOK II.,"Borne on the flames they mount above,"
26500,BOOK II.,Dark as the brown wings of the dove.
26501,BOOK II.,"The distant trees, though well-nigh bare,"
26502,BOOK II.,"Gloom thickened by the evening air,"

26512,BOOK II.,The moon is beautifully bright.
26513,BOOK II.,Now to thy lord I bid thee go:
26514,BOOK II.,Thy pleasant tale has charmed me so:
26515,BOOK II.,"One thing alone I needs must pray,"

26527,BOOK II.,She told him how the saint to show
26528,BOOK II.,Her fond affection would bestow
26529,BOOK II.,"That garland of celestial twine,"
26530,BOOK II.,Those ornaments and robes divine.
26531,BOOK II.,"Then Ráma's heart, nor Lakshman's less,"

26686,BOOK III.,
26687,BOOK III.,"Thus entertained he passed the night,"
26688,BOOK III.,"Then, with the morning's early light,"
26689,BOOK III.,To all the hermits bade adieu
26690,BOOK III.,And sought his onward way anew.
26691,BOOK III.,He pierced the mighty forest where
26692,BOOK III.,Roamed many a deer and pard and bear:
26693,BOOK III.,Its ruined pools he scarce could see.
26694,BOOK III.,"For creeper rent and prostrate tree,"
26695,BOOK III.,"Where shrill cicada's cries were heard,"
26696,BOOK III.,And plaintive notes of many a bird.
26697,BOOK III.,Deep in the thickets of the wood
26698,BOOK III.,"With Lakshman and his spouse he stood,"
26699,BOOK III.,There in the horrid shade he saw
26700,BOOK III.,A giant passing nature's law:
26701,BOOK III.,"Vast as some mountain-peak in size,"
26702,BOOK III.,"With mighty voice and sunken eyes,"
26703,BOOK III.,"Huge, hideous, tall, with monstrous face,"
26704,BOOK III.,Most ghastly of his giant race.
26705,BOOK III.,A tiger's hide the Rákshas wore
26706,BOOK III.,Still reeking with the fat and gore:
26707,BOOK III.,"Huge-faced, like Him who rules the dead,"
26708,BOOK III.,All living things he struck with dread.
26709,BOOK III.,"Three lions, tigers four, ten deer"
26710,BOOK III.,"He carried on his iron spear,"
26711,BOOK III.,"Two wolves, an elephant's head beside"
26712,BOOK III.,With mighty tusks which blood-drops dyed.
26713,BOOK III.,"When on the three his fierce eye fell,"
26714,BOOK III.,He charged them with a roar and yell
26715,BOOK III.,As furious as the grisly King
26716,BOOK III.,When stricken worlds are perishing.
26717,BOOK III.,Then with a mighty roar that shook
26718,BOOK III.,"The earth beneath their feet, he took"
26719,BOOK III.,The trembling Sítá to his side.
26720,BOOK III.,"Withdrew a little space, and cried:"
26721,BOOK III.,"""Ha, short lived wretches, ye who dare,"
26722,BOOK III.,"In hermit dress with matted hair,"
26723,BOOK III.,"Armed each with arrows, sword, and bow,"
26724,BOOK III.,Through Dandak's pathless wood to go:
26725,BOOK III.,"How with one dame, I bid you tell,"
26726,BOOK III.,Can you among ascetics dwell?
26727,BOOK III.,"Who are ye, sinners, who despise"
26728,BOOK III.,"The right, in holy men's disguise?"
26729,BOOK III.,"The great Virádha, day by day"
26730,BOOK III.,"Through this deep-tangled wood I stray,"
26731,BOOK III.,"And ever, armed with trusty steel,"
26732,BOOK III.,I seize a saint to make my meal.
26733,BOOK III.,This woman young and fair of frame
26734,BOOK III.,Shall be the conquering giant's dame:
26735,BOOK III.,"Your blood, ye things of evil life,"
26736,BOOK III.,"My lips shall quaff in battle strife."""
26737,BOOK III.,
26738,BOOK III.,"He spoke: and Janak's hapless child,"
26739,BOOK III.,"Scared by his speech so fierce and wild,"
26740,BOOK III.,"Trembled for terror, as a frail"
26741,BOOK III.,Young plantain shivers in the gale.
26742,BOOK III.,When Ráma saw Virádha clasp
26743,BOOK III.,"Fair Sítá in his mighty grasp,"
26744,BOOK III.,Thus with pale lips that terror dried
26745,BOOK III.,The hero to his brother cried:
26746,BOOK III.,"""O see Virádha's arm enfold"
26747,BOOK III.,"My darling in its cursed hold,--"
26748,BOOK III.,"The child of Janak best of kings,"
26749,BOOK III.,"My spouse whose soul to virtue clings,"
26750,BOOK III.,"Sweet princess, with pure glory bright,"
26751,BOOK III.,Nursed in the lap of soft delight.
26752,BOOK III.,"Now falls the blow Kaikeyí meant,"
26753,BOOK III.,Successful in her dark intent:
26754,BOOK III.,This day her cruel soul will be
26755,BOOK III.,Triumphant over thee and me.
26756,BOOK III.,"Though Bharat on the throne is set,"
26757,BOOK III.,Her greedy eyes look farther yet:
26758,BOOK III.,"Me from my home she dared expel,"
26759,BOOK III.,Me whom all creatures loved so well.
26760,BOOK III.,"This fatal day at length, I ween,"
26761,BOOK III.,Brings triumph to the younger queen.
26762,BOOK III.,I see with bitterest grief and shame
26763,BOOK III.,Another touch the Maithil dame.
26764,BOOK III.,Not loss of sire and royal power
26765,BOOK III.,"So grieves me as this mournful hour."""
26766,BOOK III.,
26767,BOOK III.,Thus in his anguish cried the chief:
26768,BOOK III.,"Then drowned in tears, o'erwhelmed by grief,"
26769,BOOK III.,"Thus Lakshman in his anger spake,"
26770,BOOK III.,Quick panting like a spell-bound snake:
26771,BOOK III.,
26772,BOOK III.,"""Canst thou, my brother, Indra's peer,"
26773,BOOK III.,"When I thy minister am near,"
26774,BOOK III.,"Thus grieve like some forsaken thing,"
26775,BOOK III.,"Thou, every creature's lord and king?"
26776,BOOK III.,"My vengeful shaft the fiend shall slay,"
26777,BOOK III.,And earth shall drink his blood to-day.
26778,BOOK III.,The fury which my soul at first
26779,BOOK III.,"Upon usurping Bharat nursed,"
26780,BOOK III.,On this Virádha will I wreak
26781,BOOK III.,As Indra splits the mountain peak.
26782,BOOK III.,Winged by this arm's impetuous might
26783,BOOK III.,My shaft with deadly force
26784,BOOK III.,"The monster in the chest shall smite,"
26785,BOOK III.,"And fell his shattered corse."""

26790,BOOK III.,Canto III. Virádha Attacked.
26791,BOOK III.,
26792,BOOK III.,
26793,BOOK III.,Virádha with a fearful shout
26794,BOOK III.,"That echoed through the wood, cried out:"
26795,BOOK III.,
26796,BOOK III.,"""What men are ye, I bid you say,"
26797,BOOK III.,"And whither would ye bend your way?"""
26798,BOOK III.,
26799,BOOK III.,To him whose mouth shot fiery flame
26800,BOOK III.,The hero told his race and name:
26801,BOOK III.,"""Two Warriors, nobly bred, are we,"
26802,BOOK III.,And through this wood we wander free.
26803,BOOK III.,"But who art thou, how born and styled,"
26804,BOOK III.,"Who roamest here in Dandak's wild?"""
26805,BOOK III.,
26806,BOOK III.,"To Ráma, bravest of the brave,"
26807,BOOK III.,His answer thus Virádha gave:
26808,BOOK III.,"""Hear, Raghu's son, and mark me well,"
26809,BOOK III.,And I my name and race will tell.
26810,BOOK III.,"Of Satahradá born, I spring"
26811,BOOK III.,"From Java as my sire, O King:"
26812,BOOK III.,"Me, of this lofty lineage, all"
26813,BOOK III.,Giants on earth Virádha call.
26814,BOOK III.,The rites austere I long maintained
26815,BOOK III.,From Brahmá's grace the boon have gained
26816,BOOK III.,To bear a charmed frame which ne'er
26817,BOOK III.,Weapon or shaft may pierce or tear.
26818,BOOK III.,"Go as ye came, untouched by fear,"
26819,BOOK III.,And leave with me this woman here:
26820,BOOK III.,"Go, swiftly from my presence fly,"
26821,BOOK III.,"Or by this hand ye both shall die."""
26822,BOOK III.,
26823,BOOK III.,Then Ráma with his fierce eyes red
26824,BOOK III.,With fury to the giant said:
26825,BOOK III.,"""Woe to thee, sinner, fond and weak,"
26826,BOOK III.,Who madly thus thy death wilt seek!
26827,BOOK III.,"Stand, for it waits thee in the fray:"
26828,BOOK III.,"With life thou ne'er shalt flee away."""
26829,BOOK III.,
26830,BOOK III.,"He spoke, and raised the cord whereon"
26831,BOOK III.,"A pointed arrow flashed and shone,"
26832,BOOK III.,"Then, wild with anger, from his bow,"
26833,BOOK III.,He launched the weapon on the foe.
26834,BOOK III.,"Seven times the fatal cord he drew,"
26835,BOOK III.,"And forth seven rapid arrows flew,"
26836,BOOK III.,Shafts winged with gold that left the wind
26837,BOOK III.,And e'en Suparna's(406) self behind.
26838,BOOK III.,"Full on the giant's breast they smote,"
26839,BOOK III.,"And purpled like the peacock's throat,"
26840,BOOK III.,Passed through his mighty bulk and came
26841,BOOK III.,To earth again like flakes of flame.
26842,BOOK III.,The fiend the Maithil dame unclasped;
26843,BOOK III.,"In his fierce hand his spear he grasped,"
26844,BOOK III.,"And wild with rage, pierced through and through,"
26845,BOOK III.,At Ráma and his brother flew.
26846,BOOK III.,"So loud the roar which chilled with fear,"
26847,BOOK III.,"So massy was the monster's spear,"
26848,BOOK III.,"He seemed, like Indra's flagstaff, dread"
26849,BOOK III.,As the dark God who rules the dead.
26850,BOOK III.,On huge Virádha fierce as He(407)
26851,BOOK III.,"Who smites, and worlds have ceased to be,"
26852,BOOK III.,The princely brothers poured amain
26853,BOOK III.,Their fiery flood of arrowy rain.
26854,BOOK III.,"Unmoved he stood, and opening wide"
26855,BOOK III.,"His dire mouth laughed unterrified,"
26856,BOOK III.,And ever as the monster gaped
26857,BOOK III.,Those arrows from his jaws escaped.
26858,BOOK III.,"Preserving still his life unharmed,"
26859,BOOK III.,"By Brahmá's saving promise charmed,"
26860,BOOK III.,His mighty spear aloft in air
26861,BOOK III.,"He raised, and rushed upon the pair."
26862,BOOK III.,From Ráma's bow two arrows flew
26863,BOOK III.,"And cleft that massive spear in two,"
26864,BOOK III.,Dire as the flaming levin sent
26865,BOOK III.,From out the cloudy firmament.
26866,BOOK III.,Cut by the shafts he guided well
26867,BOOK III.,To earth the giant's weapon fell:
26868,BOOK III.,"As when from Meru's summit, riven"
26869,BOOK III.,"By fiery bolts, a rock is driven."
26870,BOOK III.,"Then swift his sword each warrior drew,"
26871,BOOK III.,"Like a dread serpent black of hue,"
26872,BOOK III.,And gathering fury for the blow
26873,BOOK III.,Rushed fiercely on the giant foe.
26874,BOOK III.,"Around each prince an arm he cast,"
26875,BOOK III.,And held the dauntless heroes fast:
26876,BOOK III.,"Then, though his gashes gaped and bled,"
26877,BOOK III.,Bearing the twain he turned and fled.
26878,BOOK III.,
26879,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma saw the giant's plan,"
26880,BOOK III.,And to his brother thus began:
26881,BOOK III.,"""O Lakshman, let Virádha still"
26882,BOOK III.,"Hurry us onward as he will,"
26883,BOOK III.,"For look, Sumitrá's son, he goes"
26884,BOOK III.,"Along the path we freely chose."""
26885,BOOK III.,
26886,BOOK III.,He spoke: the rover of the night
26887,BOOK III.,"Upraised them with terrific might,"
26888,BOOK III.,"Till, to his lofty shoulders swung,"
26889,BOOK III.,Like children to his neck they clung.
26890,BOOK III.,"Then sending far his fearful roar,"
26891,BOOK III.,"The princes through the wood he bore,--"
26892,BOOK III.,"A wood like some vast cloud to view,"
26893,BOOK III.,"Where birds of every plumage flew,"
26894,BOOK III.,And mighty trees o'erarching threw
26895,BOOK III.,Dark shadows on the ground;
26896,BOOK III.,Where snakes and silvan creatures made
26897,BOOK III.,"Their dwelling, and the jackal strayed"
26898,BOOK III.,Through tangled brakes around.

26907,BOOK III.,The heroes hurried from her sight.
26908,BOOK III.,"She tossed her shapely arms on high,"
26909,BOOK III.,And shrieked aloud her bitter cry:
26910,BOOK III.,"""Ah, the dread giant bears away"
26911,BOOK III.,"The princely Ráma as his prey,"
26912,BOOK III.,"Truthful and pure, and good and great,"
26913,BOOK III.,And Lakshman shares his brother's fate.
26914,BOOK III.,The brindled tiger and the bear
26915,BOOK III.,My mangled limbs for food will tear.
26916,BOOK III.,"Take me, O best of giants, me,"
26917,BOOK III.,"And leave the sons of Raghu free."""
26918,BOOK III.,
26919,BOOK III.,"Then, by avenging fury spurred,"
26920,BOOK III.,"Her mournful cry the heroes heard,"
26921,BOOK III.,"And hastened, for the lady's sake,"
26922,BOOK III.,The wicked monster's life to take.
26923,BOOK III.,Then Lakshman with resistless stroke
26924,BOOK III.,"The foe's left arm that held him broke,"
26925,BOOK III.,"And Ráma too, as swift to smite,"
26926,BOOK III.,Smashed with his heavy hand the right.
26927,BOOK III.,With broken arms and tortured frame
26928,BOOK III.,"To earth the fainting giant came,"
26929,BOOK III.,"Like a huge cloud, or mighty rock"
26930,BOOK III.,"Rent, sundered by the levin's shock."
26931,BOOK III.,"Then rushed they on, and crushed and beat"
26932,BOOK III.,"Their foe with arms and fists and feet,"
26933,BOOK III.,And nerved each mighty limb to pound
26934,BOOK III.,And bray him on the level ground.
26935,BOOK III.,Keen arrows and each biting blade
26936,BOOK III.,Wide rents in breast and side had made;
26937,BOOK III.,"But crushed and torn and mangled, still"
26938,BOOK III.,The monster lived they could not kill.
26939,BOOK III.,When Ráma saw no arms might slay
26940,BOOK III.,"The fiend who like a mountain lay,"
26941,BOOK III.,"The glorious hero, swift to save"
26942,BOOK III.,"In danger, thus his counsel gave:"
26943,BOOK III.,"""O Prince of men, his charmed life"
26944,BOOK III.,No arms may take in battle strife:
26945,BOOK III.,Now dig we in this grove a pit
26946,BOOK III.,"His elephantine bulk to fit,"
26947,BOOK III.,And let the hollowed earth enfold
26948,BOOK III.,"The monster of gigantic mould."""
26949,BOOK III.,
26950,BOOK III.,"This said, the son of Raghu pressed"
26951,BOOK III.,His foot upon the giant's breast.
26952,BOOK III.,With joy the prostrate monster heard
26953,BOOK III.,"Victorious Ráma's welcome word,"
26954,BOOK III.,"And straight Kakutstha's son, the best"
26955,BOOK III.,"Of men, in words like these addressed:"
26956,BOOK III.,"""I yield, O chieftain, overthrown"
26957,BOOK III.,By might that vies with Indra's own.
26958,BOOK III.,Till now my folly-blinded eyes
26959,BOOK III.,"Thee, hero, failed to recognize."
26960,BOOK III.,Happy Kausalyá! blest to be
26961,BOOK III.,The mother of a son like thee!
26962,BOOK III.,"I know thee well, O chieftain, now:"
26963,BOOK III.,"Ráma, the prince of men, art thou."
26964,BOOK III.,"There stands the high-born Maithil dame,"
26965,BOOK III.,"There Lakshman, lord of mighty fame."
26966,BOOK III.,"My name was Tumburu,(408) for song"
26967,BOOK III.,Renowned among the minstrel throng:
26968,BOOK III.,Cursed by Kuvera's stern decree
26969,BOOK III.,I wear the hideous shape you see.
26970,BOOK III.,"But when I sued, his grace to crave,"
26971,BOOK III.,The glorious God this answer gave:
26972,BOOK III.,"""When Ráma, Dasaratha's son,"
26973,BOOK III.,"Destroys thee and the fight is won,"
26974,BOOK III.,"Thy proper shape once more assume,"
26975,BOOK III.,"And heaven again shall give thee room."""
26976,BOOK III.,"When thus the angry God replied,"
26977,BOOK III.,"No prayers could turn his wrath aside,"
26978,BOOK III.,And thus on me his fury fell
26979,BOOK III.,For loving Rambhá's(409) charms too well.
26980,BOOK III.,Now through thy favour am I freed
26981,BOOK III.,"From the stern fate the God decreed,"
26982,BOOK III.,"And saved, O tamer of the foe,"
26983,BOOK III.,"By thee, to heaven again shall go."
26984,BOOK III.,"A league, O Prince, beyond this spot"
26985,BOOK III.,Stands holy Sarabhanga's cot:
26986,BOOK III.,The very sun is not more bright
26987,BOOK III.,Than that most glorious anchorite:
26988,BOOK III.,"To him, O Ráma, quickly turn,"
26989,BOOK III.,And blessings from the hermit earn.
26990,BOOK III.,"First under earth my body throw,"
26991,BOOK III.,Then on thy way rejoicing go.
26992,BOOK III.,Such is the law ordained of old
26993,BOOK III.,For giants when their days are told:
26994,BOOK III.,"Their bodies laid in earth, they rise"

26996,BOOK III.,
26997,BOOK III.,"Thus, by the rankling dart oppressed,"

26999,BOOK III.,"In earth his mighty body lay,"
27000,BOOK III.,His spirit fled to heaven away.
27001,BOOK III.,
27002,BOOK III.,Thus spake Virádha ere he died;
27003,BOOK III.,And Ráma to his brother cried:
27004,BOOK III.,"""Now dig we in this grove a pit"
27005,BOOK III.,His elephantine bulk to fit.
27006,BOOK III.,And let the hollowed earth enfold
27007,BOOK III.,"This mighty giant fierce and bold."""
27008,BOOK III.,
27009,BOOK III.,"This said, the valiant hero put"
27010,BOOK III.,Upon the giant's neck his foot.
27011,BOOK III.,"His spade obedient Lakshman plied,"
27012,BOOK III.,And dug a pit both deep and wide
27013,BOOK III.,By lofty souled Virádha's side.
27014,BOOK III.,"Then Raghu's son his foot withdrew,"
27015,BOOK III.,And down the mighty form they threw;
27016,BOOK III.,One awful shout of joy he gave
27017,BOOK III.,And sank into the open grave.
27018,BOOK III.,"The heroes, to their purpose true,"
27019,BOOK III.,"In fight the cruel demon slew,"
27020,BOOK III.,And radiant with delight
27021,BOOK III.,Deep in the hollowed earth they cast
27022,BOOK III.,"The monster roaring to the last,"
27023,BOOK III.,In their resistless might.
27024,BOOK III.,Thus when they saw the warrior's steel
27025,BOOK III.,"No life-destroying blow might deal,"
27026,BOOK III.,"The pair, for lore renowned,"
27027,BOOK III.,Deep in the pit their hands had made
27028,BOOK III.,"The unresisting giant laid,"
27029,BOOK III.,And killed him neath the ground.
27030,BOOK III.,Upon himself the monster brought
27031,BOOK III.,From Ráma's hand the death he sought
27032,BOOK III.,With strong desire to gain:
27033,BOOK III.,And thus the rover of the night
27034,BOOK III.,"Told Ráma, as they strove in fight,"
27035,BOOK III.,That swords might rend and arrows smite
27036,BOOK III.,Upon his breast in vain.
27037,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma, when his speech he heard,"
27038,BOOK III.,"The giant's mighty form interred,"
27039,BOOK III.,Which mortal arms defied.
27040,BOOK III.,"With thundering crash the giant fell,"
27041,BOOK III.,And rock and cave and forest dell
27042,BOOK III.,With echoing roar replied.
27043,BOOK III.,"The princes, when their task was done"
27044,BOOK III.,"And freedom from the peril won,"
27045,BOOK III.,Rejoiced to see him die.
27046,BOOK III.,"Then in the boundless wood they strayed,"
27047,BOOK III.,Like the great sun and moon displayed
27048,BOOK III.,Triumphant in the sky.(410)

27058,BOOK III.,"With gentle words his spouse consoled,"
27059,BOOK III.,And clasped her in his loving hold.
27060,BOOK III.,Then to his brother nobly brave
27061,BOOK III.,The valiant prince his counsel gave:
27062,BOOK III.,"""Wild are these woods around us spread;"
27063,BOOK III.,And hard and rough the ground to tread:
27064,BOOK III.,"We, O my brother, ne'er have viewed"
27065,BOOK III.,So dark and drear a solitude:
27066,BOOK III.,"To Sarabhanga let us haste,"
27067,BOOK III.,"Whom wealth of holy works has graced."""
27068,BOOK III.,
27069,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma spoke, and took the road"
27070,BOOK III.,To Sarabhanga's pure abode.
27071,BOOK III.,But near that saint whose lustre vied

27073,BOOK III.,With startled eyes the prince beheld
27074,BOOK III.,A wondrous sight unparalleled.
27075,BOOK III.,In splendour like the fire and sun
27076,BOOK III.,He saw a great and glorious one.
27077,BOOK III.,"Upon a noble car he rode,"
27078,BOOK III.,And many a God behind him glowed:
27079,BOOK III.,And earth beneath his feet unpressed(411)
27080,BOOK III.,The monarch of the skies confessed.
27081,BOOK III.,"Ablaze with gems, no dust might dim"
27082,BOOK III.,The bright attire that covered him.
27083,BOOK III.,"Arrayed like him, on every side"
27084,BOOK III.,High saints their master glorified.
27085,BOOK III.,"Near, borne in air, appeared in view"
27086,BOOK III.,"His car which tawny coursers drew,"
27087,BOOK III.,"Like silver cloud, the moon, or sun"
27088,BOOK III.,Ere yet the day is well begun.
27089,BOOK III.,"Wreathed with gay garlands, o'er his head"
27090,BOOK III.,"A pure white canopy was spread,"
27091,BOOK III.,And lovely nymphs stood nigh to hold
27092,BOOK III.,"Fair chouris with their sticks of gold,"
27093,BOOK III.,"Which, waving in each gentle hand,"
27094,BOOK III.,The forehead of their monarch fanned.
27095,BOOK III.,"God, saint, and bard, a radiant ring,"
27096,BOOK III.,Sang glory to their heavenly King:
27097,BOOK III.,Forth into joyful lauds they burst
27098,BOOK III.,As Indra with the sage conversed.
27099,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma, when his wondering eyes"
27100,BOOK III.,"Beheld the monarch of the skies,"
27101,BOOK III.,"To Lakshman quickly called, and showed"
27102,BOOK III.,The car wherein Lord Indra rode:
27103,BOOK III.,"""See, brother, see that air-borne car,"
27104,BOOK III.,Whose wondrous glory shines afar:
27105,BOOK III.,Wherefrom so bright a lustre streams
27106,BOOK III.,That like a falling sun it seems:
27107,BOOK III.,"These are the steeds whose fame we know,"
27108,BOOK III.,Of heavenly race through heaven they go:
27109,BOOK III.,These are the steeds who bear the yoke
27110,BOOK III.,"Of Sakra,(412) Him whom all invoke."
27111,BOOK III.,"Behold these youths, a glorious band,"
27112,BOOK III.,Toward every wind a hundred stand:
27113,BOOK III.,"A sword in each right hand is borne,"
27114,BOOK III.,And rings of gold their arms adorn.
27115,BOOK III.,What might in every broad deep chest
27116,BOOK III.,And club-like arm is manifest!
27117,BOOK III.,Clothed in attire of crimson hue
27118,BOOK III.,They show like tigers fierce to view.
27119,BOOK III.,"Great chains of gold each warder deck,"
27120,BOOK III.,Gleaming like fire beneath his neck.
27121,BOOK III.,The age of each fair youth appears
27122,BOOK III.,Some score and five of human years:
27123,BOOK III.,The ever-blooming prime which they
27124,BOOK III.,Who live in heaven retain for aye:
27125,BOOK III.,"Such mien these lordly beings wear,"
27126,BOOK III.,"Heroic youths, most bright and fair."
27127,BOOK III.,"Now, brother, in this spot, I pray,"
27128,BOOK III.,"With the Videhan lady stay,"
27129,BOOK III.,Till I have certain knowledge who
27130,BOOK III.,"This being is, so bright to view."""
27131,BOOK III.,
27132,BOOK III.,"He spoke, and turning from the spot"
27133,BOOK III.,Sought Sarabhanga's hermit cot.
27134,BOOK III.,But when the lord of Sachí(413) saw
27135,BOOK III.,"The son of Raghu near him draw,"
27136,BOOK III.,He hastened of the sage to take
27137,BOOK III.,"His leave, and to his followers spake:"
27138,BOOK III.,
27139,BOOK III.,"""See, Ráma bends his steps this way,"
27140,BOOK III.,"But ere he yet a word can say,"
27141,BOOK III.,"Come, fly to our celestial sphere;"
27142,BOOK III.,It is not meet he see me here.
27143,BOOK III.,Soon victor and triumphant he
27144,BOOK III.,In fitter time shall look on me.
27145,BOOK III.,"Before him still a great emprise,"
27146,BOOK III.,"A task too hard for others, lies."""
27147,BOOK III.,
27148,BOOK III.,Then with all marks of honour high
27149,BOOK III.,"The Thunderer bade the saint good-bye,"
27150,BOOK III.,And in his car which coursers drew
27151,BOOK III.,Away to heaven the conqueror flew.
27152,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma, Lakshman, and the dame,"
27153,BOOK III.,"To Sarabhanga nearer came,"
27154,BOOK III.,Who sat beside the holy flame.
27155,BOOK III.,"Before the ancient sage they bent,"
27156,BOOK III.,And clasped his feet most reverent;
27157,BOOK III.,Then at his invitation found
27158,BOOK III.,A seat beside him on the ground.
27159,BOOK III.,Then Ráma prayed the sage would deign
27160,BOOK III.,Lord Indra's visit to explain;
27161,BOOK III.,And thus at length the holy man
27162,BOOK III.,In answer to his prayer began:
27163,BOOK III.,
27164,BOOK III.,"""This Lord of boons has sought me here"
27165,BOOK III.,"To waft me hence to Brahmá's sphere,"
27166,BOOK III.,"Won by my penance long and stern,--"
27167,BOOK III.,A home the lawless ne'er can earn.
27168,BOOK III.,"But when I knew that thou wast nigh,"
27169,BOOK III.,To Brahmá's world I could not fly
27170,BOOK III.,Until these longing eyes were blest
27171,BOOK III.,"With seeing thee, mine honoured guest."
27172,BOOK III.,"Since thou, O Prince, hast cheered my sight,"
27173,BOOK III.,"Great-hearted lover of the right,"
27174,BOOK III.,To heavenly spheres will I repair
27175,BOOK III.,And bliss supreme that waits me there.
27176,BOOK III.,"For I have won, dear Prince, my way"
27177,BOOK III.,"To those fair worlds which ne'er decay,"
27178,BOOK III.,Celestial seat of Brahmá's reign:
27179,BOOK III.,"Be thine, with me, those worlds to gain."""
27180,BOOK III.,
27181,BOOK III.,"Then master of all sacred lore,"
27182,BOOK III.,Spake Ráma to the saint once more:
27183,BOOK III.,
27184,BOOK III.,"""I, even I, illustrious sage,"
27185,BOOK III.,Will make those worlds mine heritage:
27186,BOOK III.,"But now, I pray, some home assign"
27187,BOOK III.,"Within this holy grove of thine."""
27188,BOOK III.,
27189,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma, Indra's peer in might,"
27190,BOOK III.,Addressed the aged anchorite:
27191,BOOK III.,"And he, with wisdom well endued,"
27192,BOOK III.,To Raghu's son his speech renewed:
27193,BOOK III.,
27194,BOOK III.,"""Sutíkshna's woodland home is near,"
27195,BOOK III.,"A glorious saint of life austere,"
27196,BOOK III.,True to the path of duty; he
27197,BOOK III.,With highest bliss will prosper thee.
27198,BOOK III.,Against the stream thy course must be
27199,BOOK III.,"Of this fair brook Mandákiní,"
27200,BOOK III.,Whereon light rafts like blossoms glide;
27201,BOOK III.,Then to his cottage turn aside.
27202,BOOK III.,"There lies thy path: but ere thou go,"
27203,BOOK III.,"Look on me, dear one, till I throw"
27204,BOOK III.,"Aside this mould that girds me in,"
27205,BOOK III.,"As casts the snake his withered skin."""
27206,BOOK III.,
27207,BOOK III.,"He spoke, the fire in order laid"
27208,BOOK III.,"With holy oil due offerings made,"
27209,BOOK III.,"And Sarabhanga, glorious sire,"
27210,BOOK III.,Laid down his body in the fire.
27211,BOOK III.,"Then rose the flame above his head,"
27212,BOOK III.,"On skin, blood, flesh, and bones it fed,"
27213,BOOK III.,"Till forth, transformed, with radiant hue"
27214,BOOK III.,"Of tender youth, he rose anew,"
27215,BOOK III.,Far-shining in his bright attire
27216,BOOK III.,Came Sarabhanga from the pyre:
27217,BOOK III.,"Above the home of saints, and those"
27218,BOOK III.,"Who feed the quenchless flame,(414) he rose:"
27219,BOOK III.,"Beyond the seat of Gods he passed,"
27220,BOOK III.,And Brahmá's sphere was gained at last.
27221,BOOK III.,"The noblest of the twice-born race,"
27222,BOOK III.,"For holy works supreme in place,"
27223,BOOK III.,The Mighty Father there beheld
27224,BOOK III.,Girt round by hosts unparalleled;
27225,BOOK III.,And Brahmá joying at the sight
27226,BOOK III.,Welcomed the glorious anchorite.

27235,BOOK III.,The holy men who dwelt around
27236,BOOK III.,"To Ráma flocked, whose martial fame"
27237,BOOK III.,Shone glorious as the kindled flame:
27238,BOOK III.,"Vaikhánasas(415) who love the wild,"
27239,BOOK III.,"Pure hermits Bálakhilyas(416) styled,"
27240,BOOK III.,"Good Samprakshálas,(417) saints who live"
27241,BOOK III.,On rays which moon and daystar give:
27242,BOOK III.,Those who with leaves their lives sustain
27243,BOOK III.,And those who pound with stones their grain:
27244,BOOK III.,"And they who lie in pools, and those"
27245,BOOK III.,"Whose corn, save teeth, no winnow knows:"
27246,BOOK III.,"Those who for beds the cold earth use,"
27247,BOOK III.,And those who every couch refuse:
27248,BOOK III.,"And those condemned to ceaseless pains,"
27249,BOOK III.,Whose single foot their weight sustains:
27250,BOOK III.,"And those who sleep neath open skies,"
27251,BOOK III.,"Whose food the wave or air supplies,"
27252,BOOK III.,And hermits pure who spend their nights
27253,BOOK III.,On ground prepared for sacred rites;
27254,BOOK III.,"Those who on hills their vigil hold,"
27255,BOOK III.,Or dripping clothes around them fold:
27256,BOOK III.,"The devotees who live for prayer,"
27257,BOOK III.,Or the five fires(418) unflinching bear.
27258,BOOK III.,"On contemplation all intent,"
27259,BOOK III.,"With light that heavenly knowledge lent,"
27260,BOOK III.,"They came to Ráma, saint and sage,"
27261,BOOK III.,In Sarabhanga's hermitage.
27262,BOOK III.,"The hermit crowd around him pressed,"
27263,BOOK III.,And thus the virtuous chief addressed:
27264,BOOK III.,"""The lordship of the earth is thine,"
27265,BOOK III.,O Prince of old Ikshváku's line.
27266,BOOK III.,"Lord of the Gods is Indra, so"
27267,BOOK III.,Thou art our lord and guide below.
27268,BOOK III.,"Thy name, the glory of thy might,"
27269,BOOK III.,Throughout the triple world are bright:
27270,BOOK III.,"Thy filial love so nobly shown,"
27271,BOOK III.,Thy truth and virtue well are known.
27272,BOOK III.,"To thee, O lord, for help we fly,"
27273,BOOK III.,And on thy love of right rely:
27274,BOOK III.,"With kindly patience hear us speak,"
27275,BOOK III.,And grant the boon we humbly seek.
27276,BOOK III.,"That lord of earth were most unjust,"
27277,BOOK III.,"Foul traitor to his solemn trust,"
27278,BOOK III.,"Who should a sixth of all(419) require,"
27279,BOOK III.,Nor guard his people like a sire.
27280,BOOK III.,But he who ever watchful strives
27281,BOOK III.,"To guard his subjects' wealth and lives,"
27282,BOOK III.,"Dear as himself or, dearer still,"
27283,BOOK III.,"His sons, with earnest heart and will,--"
27284,BOOK III.,"That king, O Raghu's son, secures"
27285,BOOK III.,"High fame that endless years endures,"
27286,BOOK III.,"And he to Brahmá's world shall rise,"
27287,BOOK III.,Made glorious in the eternal skies.
27288,BOOK III.,"Whate'er, by duty won, the meed"
27289,BOOK III.,"Of saints whom roots and berries feed,"
27290,BOOK III.,"One fourth thereof, for tender care"
27291,BOOK III.,"Of subjects, is the monarch's share."
27292,BOOK III.,"These, mostly of the Bráhman race,"
27293,BOOK III.,"Who make the wood their dwelling-place,"
27294,BOOK III.,"Although a friend in thee they view,"
27295,BOOK III.,Fall friendless neath the giant crew.
27296,BOOK III.,"Come, Ráma, come, and see hard by"

27298,BOOK III.,Where many a tangled pathway shows
27299,BOOK III.,The murderous work of cruel foes.

27301,BOOK III.,"Who live on Chitrakúta's hill,"
27302,BOOK III.,And blood of slaughtered saints has dyed
27303,BOOK III.,Mandákiní and Pampá's side.
27304,BOOK III.,No longer can we bear to see
27305,BOOK III.,The death of saint and devotee
27306,BOOK III.,Whom through the forest day by day
27307,BOOK III.,These Rákshasas unpitying slay.
27308,BOOK III.,"To thee, O Prince, we flee, and crave"
27309,BOOK III.,Thy guardian help our lives to save.
27310,BOOK III.,From these fierce rovers of the night
27311,BOOK III.,Defend each stricken anchorite.
27312,BOOK III.,Throughout the world 'twere vain to seek
27313,BOOK III.,An arm like thine to aid the weak.
27314,BOOK III.,"O Prince, we pray thee hear our call,"
27315,BOOK III.,"And from these fiends preserve us all."""
27316,BOOK III.,
27317,BOOK III.,The son of Raghu heard the plaint
27318,BOOK III.,"Of penance-loving sage and saint,"
27319,BOOK III.,And the good prince his speech renewed
27320,BOOK III.,To all the hermit multitude:
27321,BOOK III.,
27322,BOOK III.,"""To me, O saints, ye need not sue:"
27323,BOOK III.,I wait the hests of all of you.
27324,BOOK III.,I by mine own occasion led
27325,BOOK III.,"This mighty forest needs must tread,"
27326,BOOK III.,And while I keep my sire's decree
27327,BOOK III.,Your lives from threatening foes will free.
27328,BOOK III.,I hither came of free accord
27329,BOOK III.,"To lend the aid by you implored,"
27330,BOOK III.,"And richest meed my toil shall pay,"
27331,BOOK III.,While here in forest shades I stay.
27332,BOOK III.,I long in battle strife to close.
27333,BOOK III.,"And slay these fiends, the hermits' foes,"
27334,BOOK III.,That saint and sage may learn aright
27335,BOOK III.,"My prowess and my brother's might."""
27336,BOOK III.,
27337,BOOK III.,Thus to the saints his promise gave
27338,BOOK III.,That prince who still to virtue clave
27339,BOOK III.,With never-wandering thought:
27340,BOOK III.,"And then with Lakshman by his side,"
27341,BOOK III.,"With penance-wealthy men to guide,"
27342,BOOK III.,Sutíkshna's home he sought.

27349,BOOK III.,
27350,BOOK III.,"So Raghu's son, his foemen's dread,"
27351,BOOK III.,"With Sítá and his brother sped,"
27352,BOOK III.,"Girt round by many a twice-born sage,"
27353,BOOK III.,To good Sutíkshna's hermitage.(420)
27354,BOOK III.,"Through woods for many a league he passed,"
27355,BOOK III.,"O'er rushing rivers full and fast,"
27356,BOOK III.,Until a mountain fair and bright
27357,BOOK III.,As lofty Meru rose in sight.
27358,BOOK III.,Within its belt of varied wood
27359,BOOK III.,"Ikshváku's sons and Sítá stood,"
27360,BOOK III.,Where trees of every foliage bore
27361,BOOK III.,Blossom and fruit in endless store.
27362,BOOK III.,"There coats of bark, like garlands strung,"
27363,BOOK III.,"Before a lonely cottage hung,"
27364,BOOK III.,"And there a hermit, dust-besmeared,"
27365,BOOK III.,"A lotus on his breast, appeared."
27366,BOOK III.,Then Ráma with obeisance due
27367,BOOK III.,"Addressed the sage, as near he drew:"
27368,BOOK III.,"""My name is Ráma, lord; I seek"
27369,BOOK III.,"Thy presence, saint, with thee to speak."
27370,BOOK III.,"O sage, whose merits ne'er decay,"
27371,BOOK III.,"Some word unto thy servant say."""
27372,BOOK III.,
27373,BOOK III.,"The sage his eyes on Ráma bent,"
27374,BOOK III.,Of virtue's friends preëminent;
27375,BOOK III.,"Then words like these he spoke, and pressed"
27376,BOOK III.,The son of Raghu to his breast:
27377,BOOK III.,"""Welcome to thee, illustrious youth,"
27378,BOOK III.,Best champion of the rights of truth!
27379,BOOK III.,By thine approach this holy ground
27380,BOOK III.,A worthy lord this day has found.
27381,BOOK III.,I could not quit this mortal frame
27382,BOOK III.,"Till thou shouldst come, O dear to fame:"
27383,BOOK III.,"To heavenly spheres I would not rise,"
27384,BOOK III.,Expecting thee with eager eyes.
27385,BOOK III.,"I knew that thou, unkinged, hadst made"
27386,BOOK III.,Thy home in Chitrakúta's shade.
27387,BOOK III.,"E'en now, O Ráma, Indra, lord"
27388,BOOK III.,"Supreme by all the Gods adored,"
27389,BOOK III.,"King of the Hundred Offerings,(421) said,"
27390,BOOK III.,"When he my dwelling visited,"
27391,BOOK III.,That the good works that I have done
27392,BOOK III.,My choice of all the worlds have won.
27393,BOOK III.,"Accept this meed of holy vows,"
27394,BOOK III.,"And with thy brother and thy spouse,"
27395,BOOK III.,"Roam, through my favour, in the sky"
27396,BOOK III.,"Which saints celestial glorify."""
27397,BOOK III.,
27398,BOOK III.,"To that bright sage, of penance stern,"
27399,BOOK III.,"The high-souled Ráma spake in turn,"
27400,BOOK III.,As Vásava(422) who rules the skies
27401,BOOK III.,To Brahmá's gracious speech replies:
27402,BOOK III.,"""I of myself those worlds will win,"
27403,BOOK III.,O mighty hermit pure from sin:
27404,BOOK III.,"But now, O saint, I pray thee tell"
27405,BOOK III.,Where I within this wood may dwell:
27406,BOOK III.,"For I by Sarabhanga old,"
27407,BOOK III.,"The son of Gautama, was told"
27408,BOOK III.,"That thou in every lore art wise,"
27409,BOOK III.,"And seest all with loving eyes."""
27410,BOOK III.,
27411,BOOK III.,"Thus to the saint, whose glories high"
27412,BOOK III.,"Filled all the world, he made reply:"
27413,BOOK III.,And thus again the holy man
27414,BOOK III.,His pleasant speech with joy began:
27415,BOOK III.,"""This calm retreat, O Prince, is blest"

27417,BOOK III.,"Here roots and kindly fruits abound,"

27419,BOOK III.,Fair silvan beasts and gentle deer
27420,BOOK III.,In herds unnumbered wander here:
27421,BOOK III.,"And as they roam, secure from harm,"
27422,BOOK III.,Our eyes with grace and beauty charm:
27423,BOOK III.,"Except the beasts in thickets bred,"
27424,BOOK III.,"This grove of ours has naught to dread."""
27425,BOOK III.,
27426,BOOK III.,"The hermit's speech when Ráma heard,--"
27427,BOOK III.,"The hero ne'er by terror stirred,--"
27428,BOOK III.,"On his great bow his hand he laid,"
27429,BOOK III.,And thus in turn his answer made:
27430,BOOK III.,"""O saint, my darts of keenest steel,"
27431,BOOK III.,"Armed with their murderous barbs, would deal"
27432,BOOK III.,Destruction mid the silvan race
27433,BOOK III.,That flocks around thy dwelling-place.
27434,BOOK III.,Most wretched then my fate would be
27435,BOOK III.,For such dishonour shown to thee:
27436,BOOK III.,And only for the briefest stay
27437,BOOK III.,"Would I within this grove delay."""
27438,BOOK III.,
27439,BOOK III.,He spoke and ceased. With pious care
27440,BOOK III.,"He turned him to his evening prayer,"
27441,BOOK III.,"Performed each customary rite,"
27442,BOOK III.,"And sought his lodging for the night,"
27443,BOOK III.,With Sítá and his brother laid

27466,BOOK III.,Then to the Gods and sacred flame
27467,BOOK III.,"The heroes and the lady came,"

27470,BOOK III.,"When every stain was purged away,"
27471,BOOK III.,They saw the rising Lord of Day:
27472,BOOK III.,"Then to Sutíkshna's side they went,"

27479,BOOK III.,"We haste to visit, wandering by,"
27480,BOOK III.,"The ascetics' homes that round you lie,"
27481,BOOK III.,And roaming Dandak's mighty wood
27482,BOOK III.,"To view each saintly brotherhood,"
27483,BOOK III.,"For thy permission now we sue,"
27484,BOOK III.,"With these high saints to duty true,"

27487,BOOK III.,Ere on our brows the sun can beat
27488,BOOK III.,With fierce intolerable heat.
27489,BOOK III.,Like some unworthy lord who wins
27490,BOOK III.,"His power by tyranny and sins,"
27491,BOOK III.,"O saint, we fain would part."" The three"

27493,BOOK III.,He raised the princes as they pressed
27494,BOOK III.,"His feet, and strained them to his breast;"
27495,BOOK III.,And then the chief of devotees
27496,BOOK III.,Bespake them both in words like these:

27498,BOOK III.,Pursue thy path untouched by woe:

27505,BOOK III.,"There plenteous roots and berries grow,"
27506,BOOK III.,"And noble trees their blossoms show,"
27507,BOOK III.,And gentle deer and birds of air
27508,BOOK III.,In peaceful troops are gathered there.
27509,BOOK III.,There see the full-blown lotus stud
27510,BOOK III.,"The bosom of the lucid flood,"
27511,BOOK III.,And watch the joyous mallard shake
27512,BOOK III.,The reeds that fringe the pool and lake.
27513,BOOK III.,See with delighted eye the rill
27514,BOOK III.,"Leap sparkling from her parent hill,"
27515,BOOK III.,And hear the woods that round thee lie
27516,BOOK III.,Reëcho to the peacock's cry.
27517,BOOK III.,"And as I bid thy brother, so,"

27521,BOOK III.,
27522,BOOK III.,Thus spake the sage Sutíkshna: both
27523,BOOK III.,"The chiefs assented, nothing loth,"
27524,BOOK III.,"Round him with circling steps they paced,"
27525,BOOK III.,Then for the road prepared with haste.
27526,BOOK III.,"There Sítá stood, the dame long-eyed,"
27527,BOOK III.,"Fair quivers round their waists she tied,"
27528,BOOK III.,"And gave each prince his trusty bow,"
27529,BOOK III.,And sword which ne'er a spot might know.
27530,BOOK III.,Each took his quiver from her hand.
27531,BOOK III.,And clanging bow and gleaming brand:
27532,BOOK III.,Then from the hermits' home the two
27533,BOOK III.,Went forth each woodland scene to view.
27534,BOOK III.,"Each beauteous in the bloom of age,"
27535,BOOK III.,"Dismissed by that illustrious sage,"
27536,BOOK III.,"With bow and sword accoutred, hied"

27544,BOOK III.,
27545,BOOK III.,"Blest by the sage, when Raghu's son"
27546,BOOK III.,"His onward journey had begun,"
27547,BOOK III.,"Thus in her soft tone Sítá, meek"
27548,BOOK III.,"With modest fear, began to speak:"
27549,BOOK III.,"""One little slip the great may lead"
27550,BOOK III.,To shame that follows lawless deed:
27551,BOOK III.,"Such shame, my lord, as still must cling"
27552,BOOK III.,To faults from low desire that spring.
27553,BOOK III.,"Three several sins defile the soul,"
27554,BOOK III.,Born of desire that spurns control:
27555,BOOK III.,"First, utterance of a lying word,"
27556,BOOK III.,"Then, viler both, the next, and third:"
27557,BOOK III.,"The lawless love of other's wife,"
27558,BOOK III.,The thirst of blood uncaused by strife.
27559,BOOK III.,"The first, O Raghu's son, in thee"
27560,BOOK III.,"None yet has found, none e'er shall see."
27561,BOOK III.,Love of another's dame destroys
27562,BOOK III.,"All merit, lost for guilty joys:"
27563,BOOK III.,"Ráma, such crime in thee, I ween,"
27564,BOOK III.,"Has ne'er been found, shall ne'er be seen:"
27565,BOOK III.,"The very thought, my princely lord,"
27566,BOOK III.,Is in thy secret soul abhorred.
27567,BOOK III.,For thou hast ever been the same
27568,BOOK III.,"Fond lover of thine own dear dame,"
27569,BOOK III.,Content with faithful heart to do
27570,BOOK III.,"Thy father's will, most just and true:"
27571,BOOK III.,"Justice, and faith, and many a grace"
27572,BOOK III.,In thee have found a resting-place.
27573,BOOK III.,"Such virtues, Prince, the good may gain"
27574,BOOK III.,Who empire o'er each sense retain;
27575,BOOK III.,"And well canst thou, with loving view"
27576,BOOK III.,"Regarding all, each sense subdue."
27577,BOOK III.,"But for the third, the lust that strives,"
27578,BOOK III.,"Insatiate still, for others' lives,--"
27579,BOOK III.,"Fond thirst of blood where hate is none,--"
27580,BOOK III.,"This, O my lord, thou wilt not shun."
27581,BOOK III.,"Thou hast but now a promise made,"
27582,BOOK III.,The saints of Dandak wood to aid:
27583,BOOK III.,And to protect their lives from ill
27584,BOOK III.,The giants' blood in tight wilt spill:
27585,BOOK III.,And from thy promise lasting fame
27586,BOOK III.,Will glorify the forest's name.
27587,BOOK III.,Armed with thy bow and arrows thou
27588,BOOK III.,"Forth with thy brother journeyest now,"
27589,BOOK III.,While as I think how true thou art
27590,BOOK III.,"Fears for thy bliss assail my heart,"
27591,BOOK III.,And all my spirit at the sight
27592,BOOK III.,Is troubled with a strange affright.
27593,BOOK III.,I like it not--it seems not good--
27594,BOOK III.,Thy going thus to Dandak wood:
27595,BOOK III.,"And I, if thou wilt mark me well,"
27596,BOOK III.,The reason of my fear will tell.
27597,BOOK III.,"Thou with thy brother, bow in hand,"
27598,BOOK III.,"Beneath those ancient trees wilt stand,"
27599,BOOK III.,And thy keen arrows will not spare
27600,BOOK III.,Wood-rovers who will meet thee there.
27601,BOOK III.,For as the fuel food supplies
27602,BOOK III.,"That bids the dormant flame arise,"
27603,BOOK III.,Thus when the warrior grasps his bow
27604,BOOK III.,He feels his breast with ardour glow.
27605,BOOK III.,"Deep in a holy grove, of yore,"
27606,BOOK III.,"Where bird and beast from strife forbore,"
27607,BOOK III.,"Suchi beneath the sheltering boughs,"
27608,BOOK III.,A truthful hermit kept his vows.
27609,BOOK III.,"Then Indra, Sachí's heavenly lord,"
27610,BOOK III.,"Armed like a warrior with a sword,"
27611,BOOK III.,Came to his tranquil home to spoil
27612,BOOK III.,"The hermit of his holy toil,"
27613,BOOK III.,And left the glorious weapon there
27614,BOOK III.,"Entrusted to the hermit's care,"
27615,BOOK III.,"A pledge for him to keep, whose mind"
27616,BOOK III.,To fervent zeal was all resigned.
27617,BOOK III.,He took the brand: with utmost heed
27618,BOOK III.,He kept it for the warrior's need:
27619,BOOK III.,To keep his trust he fondly strove
27620,BOOK III.,When roaming in the neighbouring grove:
27621,BOOK III.,Whene'er for roots and fruit he strayed
27622,BOOK III.,Still by his side he bore the blade:
27623,BOOK III.,"Still on his sacred charge intent,"
27624,BOOK III.,He took his treasure when he went.
27625,BOOK III.,"As day by day that brand he wore,"
27626,BOOK III.,"The hermit, rich in merit's store"
27627,BOOK III.,"From penance rites each thought withdrew,"
27628,BOOK III.,And fierce and wild his spirit grew.
27629,BOOK III.,"With heedless soul he spurned the right,"
27630,BOOK III.,And found in cruel deeds delight.
27631,BOOK III.,"So, living with the sword, he fell,"
27632,BOOK III.,"A ruined hermit, down to hell."
27633,BOOK III.,This tale applies to those who deal
27634,BOOK III.,Too closely with the warrior's steel:
27635,BOOK III.,The steel to warriors is the same
27636,BOOK III.,As fuel to the smouldering flame.
27637,BOOK III.,Sincere affection prompts my speech:
27638,BOOK III.,I honour where I fain would teach.
27639,BOOK III.,"Mayst thou, thus armed with shaft and bow,"
27640,BOOK III.,So dire a longing never know
27641,BOOK III.,"As, when no hatred prompts the fray,"
27642,BOOK III.,These giants of the wood to slay:
27643,BOOK III.,For he who kills without offence
27644,BOOK III.,Shall win but little glory thence.
27645,BOOK III.,The bow the warrior joys to bend
27646,BOOK III.,"Is lent him for a nobler end,"
27647,BOOK III.,That he may save and succour those
27648,BOOK III.,Who watch in woods when pressed by foes.
27649,BOOK III.,"What, matched with woods, is bow or steel?"
27650,BOOK III.,"What, warrior's arm with hermit's zeal?"
27651,BOOK III.,We with such might have naught to do:
27652,BOOK III.,The forest rule should guide us too.
27653,BOOK III.,"But when Ayodhyá hails thee lord,"
27654,BOOK III.,Be then thy warrior life restored:
27655,BOOK III.,So shall thy sire(423) and mother joy
27656,BOOK III.,In bliss that naught may e'er destroy.
27657,BOOK III.,"And if, resigning empire, thou"
27658,BOOK III.,"Submit thee to the hermit's vow,"
27659,BOOK III.,"The noblest gain from virtue springs,"
27660,BOOK III.,And virtue joy unending brings.
27661,BOOK III.,All earthly blessings virtue sends:
27662,BOOK III.,On virtue all the world depends.
27663,BOOK III.,Those who with vow and fasting tame
27664,BOOK III.,"To due restraint the mind and frame,"
27665,BOOK III.,"Win by their labour, nobly wise,"
27666,BOOK III.,The highest virtue for their prize.
27667,BOOK III.,"Pure in the hermit's grove remain,"
27668,BOOK III.,"True to thy duty, free from stain."
27669,BOOK III.,But the three worlds are open thrown
27670,BOOK III.,"To thee, by whom all things are known."
27671,BOOK III.,Who gave me power that I should dare
27672,BOOK III.,His duty to my lord declare?
27673,BOOK III.,"'Tis woman's fancy, light as air,"
27674,BOOK III.,That moves my foolish breast.
27675,BOOK III.,"Now with thy brother counsel take,"
27676,BOOK III.,"Reflect, thy choice with judgment make,"

27696,BOOK III.,That misery's tears may cease to flow;
27697,BOOK III.,And those pure saints who love the shade
27698,BOOK III.,Of Dandak wood are sore dismayed.
27699,BOOK III.,"They sought me of their own accord,"

27709,BOOK III.,"I heard, and from my lips there fell"

27713,BOOK III.,
27714,BOOK III.,"""Your favour, gracious lords, I claim,"
27715,BOOK III.,O'erwhelmed with this enormous shame
27716,BOOK III.,"That Bráhmans, great and pure as you,"
27717,BOOK III.,"Who should be sought, to me should sue."""
27718,BOOK III.,"And then before the saintly crowd,"
27719,BOOK III.,"""What can I do?"" I cried aloud."
27720,BOOK III.,Then from the trembling hermits broke
27721,BOOK III.,"One long sad cry, and thus they spoke:"
27722,BOOK III.,"""Fiends of the wood, who wear at will"
27723,BOOK III.,"Each varied shape, afflict us still."
27724,BOOK III.,To thee in our distress we fly:

27729,BOOK III.,Assail us with resistless power.

27731,BOOK III.,The hermits on their vows intent:
27732,BOOK III.,We look around for help and see
27733,BOOK III.,"Our surest refuge, Prince, in thee."
27734,BOOK III.,"We, armed with powers of penance, might"
27735,BOOK III.,Destroy the rovers of the night:
27736,BOOK III.,But loth were we to bring to naught
27737,BOOK III.,The merit years of toil have bought.
27738,BOOK III.,"Our penance rites are grown too hard,"
27739,BOOK III.,"By many a check and trouble barred,"
27740,BOOK III.,But though our saints for food are slain
27741,BOOK III.,The withering curse we yet restrain.

27830,BOOK III.,On strictest rule his stern life spent.
27831,BOOK III.,"Ten thousand years the stream his bed,"
27832,BOOK III.,Ten thousand years on air he fed.
27833,BOOK III.,Then on the blessed Gods who dwell
27834,BOOK III.,In heavenly homes great terror fell:
27835,BOOK III.,"They gathered all, by Agni led,"
27836,BOOK III.,And counselled thus disquieted:
27837,BOOK III.,"""The hermit by ascetic pain"

27885,BOOK III.,"Here weeks, there fortnights, more or less,"

27887,BOOK III.,As there the hero dwelt at ease
27888,BOOK III.,"Among those holy devotees,"
27889,BOOK III.,In days untroubled o'er his head
27890,BOOK III.,Ten circling years of pleasure fled.
27891,BOOK III.,So Raghu's son in duty trained
27892,BOOK III.,"A while in every cot remained,"
27893,BOOK III.,Then with his dame retraced the road
27894,BOOK III.,To good Sutíkshna's calm abode.
27895,BOOK III.,Hailed by the saints with honours due
27896,BOOK III.,"Near to the hermit's home he drew,"
27897,BOOK III.,And there the tamer of his foes
27898,BOOK III.,Dwelt for a time in sweet repose.
27899,BOOK III.,One day within that holy wood

27910,BOOK III.,"Nor, searching unassisted, find"
27911,BOOK III.,That hermit of the thoughtful mind.
27912,BOOK III.,I with my wife and brother fain
27913,BOOK III.,"Would go, his favour to obtain,"
27914,BOOK III.,Would seek him in his lone retreat
27915,BOOK III.,And the great saint with reverence greet.
27916,BOOK III.,"This one desire, O Master, long"
27917,BOOK III.,"Cherished within my heart, is strong,"
27918,BOOK III.,That I may pay of free accord
27919,BOOK III.,"My duty to that hermit lord."""
27920,BOOK III.,
27921,BOOK III.,As thus the prince whose heart was bent
27922,BOOK III.,"On virtue told his firm intent,"
27923,BOOK III.,"The good Sutíkshna's joy rose high,"
27924,BOOK III.,And thus in turn he made reply:
27925,BOOK III.,"""The very thing, O Prince, which thou"
27926,BOOK III.,"Hast sought, I wished to urge but now,"
27927,BOOK III.,Bid thee with wife and brother see
27928,BOOK III.,"Agastya, glorious devotee."
27929,BOOK III.,I count this thing an omen fair
27930,BOOK III.,"That thou shouldst thus thy wish declare,"
27931,BOOK III.,"And I, my Prince, will gladly teach"
27932,BOOK III.,The way Agastya's home to reach.
27933,BOOK III.,"Southward, dear son, direct thy feet"
27934,BOOK III.,Eight leagues beyond this still retreat:
27935,BOOK III.,Agastya's hermit brother there
27936,BOOK III.,Dwells in a home most bright and fair.
27937,BOOK III.,"'Tis on a knoll of woody ground,"
27938,BOOK III.,With many a branching Pippal(426) crowned:
27939,BOOK III.,"There sweet birds' voices ne'er are mute,"
27940,BOOK III.,And trees are gay with flower and fruit.
27941,BOOK III.,"There many a lake gleams bright and cool,"
27942,BOOK III.,"And lilies deck each pleasant pool,"
27943,BOOK III.,"While swan, and crane, and mallard's wings"
27944,BOOK III.,Are lovely in the water-springs.
27945,BOOK III.,"There for one night, O Ráma, stay,"
27946,BOOK III.,And with the dawn pursue thy way.
27947,BOOK III.,"Still farther, bending southward, by"
27948,BOOK III.,"The thicket's edge the course must lie,"
27949,BOOK III.,"And thou wilt see, two leagues from thence"
27950,BOOK III.,"Agastya's lovely residence,"
27951,BOOK III.,"Set in the woodland's fairest spot,"
27952,BOOK III.,All varied foliage decks the cot:
27953,BOOK III.,"There Sítá, Lakshman thou, at ease"
27954,BOOK III.,"May spend sweet hours neath shady trees,"
27955,BOOK III.,For all of noblest growth are found
27956,BOOK III.,Luxuriant on that bosky ground.
27957,BOOK III.,If it be still thy firm intent
27958,BOOK III.,"To see that saint preëminent,"
27959,BOOK III.,"O mighty counsellor, this day"
27960,BOOK III.,"Depart upon thine onward way."""
27961,BOOK III.,
27962,BOOK III.,"The hermit spake, and Ráma bent"
27963,BOOK III.,"His head, with Lakshman, reverent,"
27964,BOOK III.,And then with him and Janak's child
27965,BOOK III.,Set out to trace the forest wild.
27966,BOOK III.,"He saw dark woods that fringed the road,"
27967,BOOK III.,"And distant hills like clouds that showed,"
27968,BOOK III.,"And, as the way he followed, met"
27969,BOOK III.,With many a lake and rivulet.
27970,BOOK III.,So passing on with ease where led
27971,BOOK III.,"The path Sutíkshna bade him tread,"
27972,BOOK III.,The hero with exulting breast
27973,BOOK III.,His brother in these words addressed:
27974,BOOK III.,
27975,BOOK III.,"""Here, surely, is the home, in sight,"
27976,BOOK III.,Of that illustrious anchorite:
27977,BOOK III.,Here great Agastya's brother leads
27978,BOOK III.,A life intent on holy deeds.
27979,BOOK III.,"Warned of each guiding mark and sign,"
27980,BOOK III.,I see them all herein combine:
27981,BOOK III.,I see the branches bending low
27982,BOOK III.,Beneath the flowers and fruit they show.
27983,BOOK III.,"A soft air from the forest springs,"
27984,BOOK III.,"Fresh from the odorous grass, and brings"
27985,BOOK III.,A spicy fragrance as it flees
27986,BOOK III.,O'er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.
27987,BOOK III.,"See, here and there around us high"
27988,BOOK III.,"Piled up in heaps cleft billets lie,"
27989,BOOK III.,"And holy grass is gathered, bright"
27990,BOOK III.,As strips of shining lazulite.
27991,BOOK III.,Full in the centre of the shade
27992,BOOK III.,The hermits' holy fire is laid:
27993,BOOK III.,I see its smoke the pure heaven streak
27994,BOOK III.,Dense as a big cloud's dusky peak.
27995,BOOK III.,The twice-born men their steps retrace
27996,BOOK III.,"From each sequestered bathing-place,"
27997,BOOK III.,And each his sacred gift has brought
27998,BOOK III.,Of blossoms which his hands have sought.
27999,BOOK III.,"Of all these signs, dear brother, each"
28000,BOOK III.,"Agrees with good Sutíkshna's speech,"
28001,BOOK III.,And doubtless in this holy bound
28002,BOOK III.,Agastya's brother will be found.
28003,BOOK III.,"Agastya once, the worlds who viewed"
28004,BOOK III.,"With love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,"
28005,BOOK III.,"And armed with mighty power, obtained"
28006,BOOK III.,"By holy works, this grove ordained"
28007,BOOK III.,To be a refuge and defence
28008,BOOK III.,From all oppressors' violence.
28009,BOOK III.,In days of yore within this place
28010,BOOK III.,"Two brothers fierce of demon race,"
28011,BOOK III.,"Vátápi dire and Ilval, dwelt,"
28012,BOOK III.,And slaughter mid the Bráhmans dealt.
28013,BOOK III.,"A Bráhman's form, the fiend to cloak,"
28014,BOOK III.,"Fierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,"
28015,BOOK III.,And twice-born sages would invite
28016,BOOK III.,To solemnize some funeral rite.
28017,BOOK III.,"His brother's flesh, concealed within"
28018,BOOK III.,"A ram's false shape and borrowed skin,--"
28019,BOOK III.,"As men are wont at funeral feasts,--"
28020,BOOK III.,He dressed and fed those gathered priests.
28021,BOOK III.,"The holy men, unweeting ill,"
28022,BOOK III.,Took of the food and ate their fill.
28023,BOOK III.,Then Ilval with a mighty shout
28024,BOOK III.,"Exclaimed ""Vátápi, issue out."""
28025,BOOK III.,"Soon as his brother's voice he heard,"
28026,BOOK III.,The fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:
28027,BOOK III.,"Rending in pieces every frame,"
28028,BOOK III.,Forth from the dying priests he came.
28029,BOOK III.,So they who changed their forms at will
28030,BOOK III.,"Thousands of Bráhmans dared to kill,--"
28031,BOOK III.,"Fierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,"
28032,BOOK III.,And joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.
28033,BOOK III.,"Agastya, mighty hermit, pressed"
28034,BOOK III.,"To funeral banquet like the rest,"
28035,BOOK III.,Obedient to the Gods' appeal
28036,BOOK III.,Ate up the monster at a meal.
28037,BOOK III.,"""'Tis done, 'tis done,"" fierce Ilval cried,"
28038,BOOK III.,And water for his hands supplied:
28039,BOOK III.,Then lifting up his voice he spake:
28040,BOOK III.,"""Forth, brother, from thy prison break."""
28041,BOOK III.,"Then him who called the fiend, who long"
28042,BOOK III.,"Had wrought the suffering Bráhmans wrong,"
28043,BOOK III.,"Thus thoughtful-souled Agastya, best"
28044,BOOK III.,"Of hermits, with a smile addressed:"
28045,BOOK III.,"""How, Rákshas, is the fiend empowered"
28046,BOOK III.,To issue forth whom I devoured?
28047,BOOK III.,Thy brother in a ram's disguise
28048,BOOK III.,"Is gone where Yáma's kingdom lies."""
28049,BOOK III.,When from the words Agastya said
28050,BOOK III.,"He knew his brother fiend was dead,"
28051,BOOK III.,"His soul on fire with vengeful rage,"
28052,BOOK III.,Rushed the night-rover at the sage.
28053,BOOK III.,"One lightning glance of fury, hot"
28054,BOOK III.,"As fire, the glorious hermit shot,"
28055,BOOK III.,"As the fiend neared him in his stride,"
28056,BOOK III.,"And straight, consumed to dust, he died."
28057,BOOK III.,In pity for the Bráhmans' plight
28058,BOOK III.,Agastya wrought this deed of might:
28059,BOOK III.,This grove which lakes and fair trees grace
28060,BOOK III.,"In his great brother's dwelling place."""
28061,BOOK III.,
28062,BOOK III.,"As Ráma thus the tale rehearsed,"
28063,BOOK III.,"And with Sumitrá's son conversed,"
28064,BOOK III.,"The setting sun his last rays shed,"
28065,BOOK III.,And evening o'er the land was spread.
28066,BOOK III.,A while the princely brothers stayed
28067,BOOK III.,"And even rites in order paid,"
28068,BOOK III.,Then to the holy grove they drew
28069,BOOK III.,And hailed the saint with honour due.
28070,BOOK III.,With courtesy was Ráma met
28071,BOOK III.,"By that illustrious anchoret,"
28072,BOOK III.,And for one night he rested there
28073,BOOK III.,Regaled with fruit and hermit fare.
28074,BOOK III.,"But when the night had reached its close,"
28075,BOOK III.,"And the sun's glorious circle rose,"
28076,BOOK III.,The son of Raghu left his bed
28077,BOOK III.,And to the hermit's brother said:
28078,BOOK III.,"""Well rested in thy hermit cell,"
28079,BOOK III.,"I stand, O saint, to bid farewell;"
28080,BOOK III.,For with thy leave I journey hence
28081,BOOK III.,"Thy brother saint to reverence."""
28082,BOOK III.,"""Go, Ráma go,"" the sage replied:"
28083,BOOK III.,Then from the cot the chieftain hied.
28084,BOOK III.,"And while the pleasant grove he viewed,"
28085,BOOK III.,"The path the hermit showed, pursued."
28086,BOOK III.,"Of every leaf, of changing hue."
28087,BOOK III.,"Plants, trees by hundreds round him grew,"
28088,BOOK III.,"With joyous eyes he looked on all,"
28089,BOOK III.,"Then Jak,(427) the wild rice, and Sál;(428)"
28090,BOOK III.,"He saw the red Hibiscus glow,"
28091,BOOK III.,He saw the flower-tipped creeper throw
28092,BOOK III.,The glory of her clusters o'er
28093,BOOK III.,Tall trees that loads of blossom bore.
28094,BOOK III.,"Some, elephants had prostrate laid,"
28095,BOOK III.,"In some the monkeys leapt and played,"
28096,BOOK III.,And through the whole wide forest rang
28097,BOOK III.,The charm of gay birds as they sang.
28098,BOOK III.,Then Ráma of the lotus eye
28099,BOOK III.,"To Lakshman turned who followed nigh,"
28100,BOOK III.,And thus the hero youth impressed
28101,BOOK III.,"With Fortune's favouring signs, addressed:"
28102,BOOK III.,
28103,BOOK III.,"""How soft the leaves of every tree,"
28104,BOOK III.,How tame each bird and beast we see!
28105,BOOK III.,Soon the fair home shall we behold
28106,BOOK III.,Of that great hermit tranquil-souled.
28107,BOOK III.,The deed the good Agastya wrought
28108,BOOK III.,High fame throughout the world has bought:
28109,BOOK III.,"I see, I see his calm retreat"
28110,BOOK III.,That balms the pain of weary feet.
28111,BOOK III.,"Where white clouds rise from flames beneath,"
28112,BOOK III.,"Where bark-coats lie with many a wreath,"
28113,BOOK III.,"Where silvan things, made gentle, throng,"
28114,BOOK III.,And every bird is loud in song.
28115,BOOK III.,"With ruth for suffering creatures filled,"
28116,BOOK III.,"A deathlike fiend with might he killed,"
28117,BOOK III.,And gave this southern realm to be
28118,BOOK III.,"A refuge, from oppression free."
28119,BOOK III.,"There stands his home, whose dreaded might"
28120,BOOK III.,"Has put the giant crew to flight,"
28121,BOOK III.,Who view with envious eyes afar
28122,BOOK III.,The peaceful shades they cannot mar.
28123,BOOK III.,Since that most holy saint has made
28124,BOOK III.,"His dwelling in this lovely shade,"
28125,BOOK III.,Checked by his might the giant brood
28126,BOOK III.,Have dwelt in peace with souls subdued.
28127,BOOK III.,"And all this southern realm, within"
28128,BOOK III.,"Whose bounds no fiend may entrance win,"
28129,BOOK III.,"Now bears a name which naught may dim,"
28130,BOOK III.,Made glorious through the worlds by him.
28131,BOOK III.,"When Vindhya, best of hills, would stay"
28132,BOOK III.,"The journey of the Lord of Day,"
28133,BOOK III.,Obedient to the saint's behest
28134,BOOK III.,He bowed for aye his humbled crest.
28135,BOOK III.,"That hoary hermit, world-renowned"
28136,BOOK III.,"For holy deeds, within this ground"
28137,BOOK III.,"Has set his pure and blessed home,"
28138,BOOK III.,Where gentle silvan creatures roam.
28139,BOOK III.,"Agastya, whom the worlds revere,"
28140,BOOK III.,"Pure saint to whom the good are dear,"
28141,BOOK III.,"To us his guests all grace will show,"
28142,BOOK III.,Enriched with blessings ere we go.
28143,BOOK III.,"I to this aim each thought will turn,"
28144,BOOK III.,"The favour of the saint to earn,"
28145,BOOK III.,That here in comfort may be spent
28146,BOOK III.,The last years of our banishment.
28147,BOOK III.,"Here sanctities and high saints stand,"
28148,BOOK III.,"Gods, minstrels of the heavenly band;"
28149,BOOK III.,"Upon Agastya's will they wait,"
28150,BOOK III.,"And serve him, pure and temperate."
28151,BOOK III.,"The liar's tongue, the tyrant's mind"
28152,BOOK III.,Within these bounds no home may find:
28153,BOOK III.,"No cheat, no sinner here can be:"
28154,BOOK III.,So holy and so good is he.
28155,BOOK III.,"Here birds and lords of serpent race,"
28156,BOOK III.,"Spirits and Gods who haunt the place,"
28157,BOOK III.,"Content with scanty fare remain,"
28158,BOOK III.,As merit's meed they strive to gain.
28159,BOOK III.,"Made perfect here, the saints supreme,"
28160,BOOK III.,"On cars that mock the Day-God's gleam,--"
28161,BOOK III.,"Their mortal bodies cast aside,--"
28162,BOOK III.,"Sought heaven transformed and glorified,"
28163,BOOK III.,"Here Gods to living things, who win"
28164,BOOK III.,"Their favour, pure from cruel sin,"
28165,BOOK III.,"Give royal rule and many a good,"
28166,BOOK III.,Immortal life and spirithood.
28167,BOOK III.,"Now, Lakshman, we are near the place:"
28168,BOOK III.,"Do thou precede a little space,"
28169,BOOK III.,And tell the mighty saint that I
28170,BOOK III.,"With Sítá at my side am nigh."""
28171,BOOK III.,
28172,BOOK III.,
28173,BOOK III.,
28174,BOOK III.,
28175,BOOK III.,Canto XII. The Heavenly Bow.
28176,BOOK III.,
28177,BOOK III.,
28178,BOOK III.,He spoke: the younger prince obeyed:
28179,BOOK III.,"Within the bounds his way he made,"
28180,BOOK III.,"And thus addressed, whom first he met,"
28181,BOOK III.,A pupil of the anchoret:
28182,BOOK III.,
28183,BOOK III.,"""Brave Ráma, eldest born, who springs,"
28184,BOOK III.,"From Dasaratha, hither brings"
28185,BOOK III.,His wife the lady Sítá: he
28186,BOOK III.,Would fain the holy hermit see.
28187,BOOK III.,Lakshman am I--if happy fame
28188,BOOK III.,E'er to thine ears has brought the name--
28189,BOOK III.,"His younger brother, prompt to do"
28190,BOOK III.,"His will, devoted, fond, and true."
28191,BOOK III.,"We, through our royal sire's decree,"
28192,BOOK III.,To the dread woods were forced to flee.
28193,BOOK III.,"Tell the great Master, I entreat,"
28194,BOOK III.,"Our earnest wish our lord to greet."""
28195,BOOK III.,
28196,BOOK III.,He spoke: the hermit rich in store
28197,BOOK III.,"Of fervid zeal and sacred lore,"
28198,BOOK III.,"Sought the pure shrine which held the fire,"
28199,BOOK III.,To bear his message to the sire.
28200,BOOK III.,Soon as he reached the saint most bright
28201,BOOK III.,"In sanctity's surpassing might,"
28202,BOOK III.,"He cried, uplifting reverent hands:"
28203,BOOK III.,"""Lord Ráma near thy cottage stands."""
28204,BOOK III.,Then spoke Agastya's pupil dear
28205,BOOK III.,The message for his lord to hear:
28206,BOOK III.,"""Ráma and Lakshman, chiefs who spring"
28207,BOOK III.,"From Dasaratha, glorious king,"
28208,BOOK III.,"Thy hermitage e'en now have sought,"
28209,BOOK III.,And lady Sítá with them brought.
28210,BOOK III.,The tamers of the foe are here
28211,BOOK III.,"To see thee, Master, and revere."
28212,BOOK III.,'Tis thine thy further will to say:
28213,BOOK III.,"Deign to command, and we obey."""
28214,BOOK III.,
28215,BOOK III.,When from his pupil's lips he knew
28216,BOOK III.,"The presence of the princely two,"
28217,BOOK III.,And Sítá born to fortune high.
28218,BOOK III.,The glorious hermit made reply:
28219,BOOK III.,"""Great joy at last is mine this day"
28220,BOOK III.,"That Ráma hither finds his way,"
28221,BOOK III.,For long my soul has yearned to see
28222,BOOK III.,The prince who comes to visit me.
28223,BOOK III.,"Go forth, go forth, and hither bring"
28224,BOOK III.,The royal three with welcoming:
28225,BOOK III.,Lead Ráma in and place him near:
28226,BOOK III.,"Why stands he not already here?"""
28227,BOOK III.,
28228,BOOK III.,"Thus ordered by the hermit, who,"
28229,BOOK III.,"Lord of his thought, all duty knew,"
28230,BOOK III.,"His reverent hands together laid,"
28231,BOOK III.,The pupil answered and obeyed.
28232,BOOK III.,"Forth from the place with speed he ran,"
28233,BOOK III.,To Lakshman came and thus began:
28234,BOOK III.,"""Where is he? let not Ráma wait,"
28235,BOOK III.,"But speed, the sage to venerate."""
28236,BOOK III.,
28237,BOOK III.,Then with the pupil Lakshman went
28238,BOOK III.,"Across the hermit settlement,"
28239,BOOK III.,And showed him Ráma where he stood
28240,BOOK III.,With Janak's daughter in the wood.
28241,BOOK III.,The pupil then his message spake
28242,BOOK III.,Which the kind hermit bade him take;
28243,BOOK III.,Then led the honoured Ráma thence
28244,BOOK III.,And brought him in with reverence.
28245,BOOK III.,As nigh the royal Ráma came
28246,BOOK III.,"With Lakshman and the Maithil dame,"
28247,BOOK III.,He viewed the herds of gentle deer
28248,BOOK III.,Roaming the garden free from fear.
28249,BOOK III.,As through the sacred grove he trod
28250,BOOK III.,"He viewed the seat of many a God,"
28251,BOOK III.,"Brahmá and Agni,(429) Sun and Moon,"
28252,BOOK III.,And His who sends each golden boon;(430)
28253,BOOK III.,"Here Vishnu's stood, there Bhaga's(431) shrine,"
28254,BOOK III.,"And there Mahendra's, Lord divine;"
28255,BOOK III.,"Here His who formed this earthly frame,(432)"
28256,BOOK III.,His there from whom all beings came.(433)
28257,BOOK III.,"Váyu's,(434) and His who loves to hold"
28258,BOOK III.,"The great noose, Varun(435) mighty-souled:"
28259,BOOK III.,"Here was the Vasus'(436) shrine to see,"
28260,BOOK III.,"Here that of sacred Gáyatrí,(437)"
28261,BOOK III.,"The king of serpents(438) here had place,"
28262,BOOK III.,And he who rules the feathered race.(439)
28263,BOOK III.,"Here Kártikeya,(440) warrior lord,"
28264,BOOK III.,And there was Justice King adored.
28265,BOOK III.,Then with disciples girt about
28266,BOOK III.,The mighty saint himself came out:
28267,BOOK III.,Through fierce devotion bright as flame
28268,BOOK III.,Before the rest the Master came:
28269,BOOK III.,"And then to Lakshman, fortune blest,"
28270,BOOK III.,Ráma these hasty words addressed:
28271,BOOK III.,"""Behold, Agastya's self draws near,"
28272,BOOK III.,"The mighty saint, whom all revere:"
28273,BOOK III.,With spirit raised I meet my lord
28274,BOOK III.,"With richest wealth of penance stored."""
28275,BOOK III.,
28276,BOOK III.,"The strong-armed hero spake, and ran"
28277,BOOK III.,Forward to meet the sunbright man.
28278,BOOK III.,"Before him, as he came, he bent"
28279,BOOK III.,"And clasped his feet most reverent,"
28280,BOOK III.,Then rearing up his stately height
28281,BOOK III.,"Stood suppliant by the anchorite,"
28282,BOOK III.,While Lakshman's strength and Sítá's grace
28283,BOOK III.,Stood by the pride of Raghu's race.
28284,BOOK III.,The sage his arms round Ráma threw
28285,BOOK III.,"And welcomed him with honours due,"
28286,BOOK III.,"Asked, was all well, with question sweet,"
28287,BOOK III.,And bade the hero to a seat.
28288,BOOK III.,"With holy oil he fed the flame,"
28289,BOOK III.,"He brought the gifts which strangers claim,"
28290,BOOK III.,And kindly waiting on the three
28291,BOOK III.,"With honours due to high degree,"
28292,BOOK III.,He gave with hospitable care
28293,BOOK III.,A simple hermit's woodland fare.
28294,BOOK III.,"Then sat the reverend father, first"
28295,BOOK III.,"Of hermits, deep in duty versed."
28296,BOOK III.,"And thus to suppliant Ráma, bred"
28297,BOOK III.,"In all the lore of virtue, said:"
28298,BOOK III.,"""Did the false hermit, Prince, neglect"
28299,BOOK III.,"To hail his guest with due respect,"
28300,BOOK III.,"He must,--the doom the perjured meet,--"
28301,BOOK III.,His proper flesh hereafter eat.
28302,BOOK III.,"A car-borne king, a lord who sways"
28303,BOOK III.,"The earth, and virtue's law obeys,"
28304,BOOK III.,"Worthy of highest honour, thou"
28305,BOOK III.,"Hast sought, dear guest, my cottage now."""
28306,BOOK III.,"He spoke: with fruit and hermit fare,"
28307,BOOK III.,"With every bloom the branches bare,"
28308,BOOK III.,"Agastya graced his honoured guest,"
28309,BOOK III.,And thus with gentle words addressed:
28310,BOOK III.,"""Accept this mighty bow, divine,"
28311,BOOK III.,Whereon red gold and diamonds shine;
28312,BOOK III.,'Twas by the Heavenly Artist planned
28313,BOOK III.,For Vishnu's own almighty hand;
28314,BOOK III.,"This God-sent shaft of sunbright hue,"
28315,BOOK III.,"Whose deadly flight is ever true,"
28316,BOOK III.,By Lord Mahendra given of yore:
28317,BOOK III.,This quiver with its endless store.
28318,BOOK III.,Keen arrows hurtling to their aim
28319,BOOK III.,Like kindled fires that flash and flame:
28320,BOOK III.,"Accept, in golden sheath encased,"
28321,BOOK III.,This sword with hilt of rich gold graced.
28322,BOOK III.,Armed with this best of bows
28323,BOOK III.,"Lord Vishnu slew his demon foes,"
28324,BOOK III.,And mid the dwellers in the skies
28325,BOOK III.,Won brilliant glory for his prize.
28326,BOOK III.,"The bow, the quivers, shaft, and sword"
28327,BOOK III.,"Received from me, O glorious lord:"
28328,BOOK III.,"These conquest to thine arm shall bring,"
28329,BOOK III.,"As thunder to the thunder's King."""
28330,BOOK III.,
28331,BOOK III.,The splendid hermit bade him take
28332,BOOK III.,"The noble weapons as he spake,"
28333,BOOK III.,And as the prince accepted each
28334,BOOK III.,In words like these renewed his speech:
28335,BOOK III.,
28336,BOOK III.,
28337,BOOK III.,
28338,BOOK III.,
28339,BOOK III.,Canto XIII. Agastya's Counsel.
28340,BOOK III.,
28341,BOOK III.,
28342,BOOK III.,"""O Ráma, great delight I feel,"
28343,BOOK III.,"Pleased, Lakshman, with thy faithful zeal,"
28344,BOOK III.,That you within these shades I see
28345,BOOK III.,With Sítá come to honour me.
28346,BOOK III.,But wandering through the rough rude wild
28347,BOOK III.,Has wearied Janak's gentle child:
28348,BOOK III.,With labours of the way oppressed
28349,BOOK III.,The Maithil lady longs for rest.
28350,BOOK III.,"Young, delicate, and soft, and fair,"
28351,BOOK III.,"Such toils as these untrained to bear,"
28352,BOOK III.,Her wifely love the dame has led
28353,BOOK III.,The forest's troubled ways to tread.
28354,BOOK III.,"Here, Ráma, see that naught annoy"
28355,BOOK III.,Her easy hours of tranquil joy:
28356,BOOK III.,"A glorious task has she assayed,"
28357,BOOK III.,To follow thee through woodland shade.
28358,BOOK III.,"Since first from Nature's hand she came,"
28359,BOOK III.,"A woman's mood is still the same,"
28360,BOOK III.,"When Fortune smiles, her love to show,"
28361,BOOK III.,And leave her lord in want and woe.
28362,BOOK III.,"No pity then her heart can feel,"
28363,BOOK III.,"She arms her soul with warrior's steel,"
28364,BOOK III.,"Swift as the storm or Feathered King,"
28365,BOOK III.,Uncertain as the lightning's wing.
28366,BOOK III.,Not so thy spouse: her purer mind
28367,BOOK III.,Shrinks from the faults of womankind;
28368,BOOK III.,"Like chaste Arundhatí(441) above,"
28369,BOOK III.,A paragon of faithful love.
28370,BOOK III.,"Let these blest shades, dear Ráma, be"
28371,BOOK III.,"A home for Lakshman, her, and thee."""
28372,BOOK III.,
28373,BOOK III.,With raised hands reverently meek
28374,BOOK III.,"He heard the holy hermit speak,"
28375,BOOK III.,And humbly thus addressed the sire
28376,BOOK III.,Whose glory shone like kindled fire:
28377,BOOK III.,
28378,BOOK III.,"""How blest am I, what thanks I owe"
28379,BOOK III.,That our great Master deigns to show
28380,BOOK III.,"His favour, that his heart can be"
28381,BOOK III.,"Content with Lakshman, Sítá, me."
28382,BOOK III.,"Show me, I pray, some spot of ground"
28383,BOOK III.,"Where thick trees wave and springs abound,"
28384,BOOK III.,That I may raise my hermit cell
28385,BOOK III.,"And there in tranquil pleasure dwell."""
28386,BOOK III.,
28387,BOOK III.,"Then thus replied Agastya, best"
28388,BOOK III.,"Of hermits, to the chief's request:"
28389,BOOK III.,When for a little he had bent
28390,BOOK III.,"His thoughts, upon that prayer intent:"
28391,BOOK III.,
28392,BOOK III.,"""Beloved son, four leagues away"
28393,BOOK III.,Is Panchavatí bright and gay:
28394,BOOK III.,"Thronged with its deer, most fair it looks"
28395,BOOK III.,"With berries, fruit, and water-brooks."
28396,BOOK III.,There build thee with thy brother's aid
28397,BOOK III.,"A cottage in the quiet shade,"
28398,BOOK III.,"And faithful to thy sire's behest,"
28399,BOOK III.,"Obedient to the sentence, rest."
28400,BOOK III.,"For well, O sinless chieftain, well"
28401,BOOK III.,"I know thy tale, how all befell:"
28402,BOOK III.,Stern penance and the love I bore
28403,BOOK III.,Thy royal sire supply the lore.
28404,BOOK III.,To me long rites and fervid zeal
28405,BOOK III.,"The wish that stirs thy heart reveal,"
28406,BOOK III.,"And hence my guest I bade thee be,"
28407,BOOK III.,That this pure grove might shelter thee.
28408,BOOK III.,"So now, thereafter, thus I speak:"
28409,BOOK III.,The shades of Panchavatí seek;
28410,BOOK III.,"That tranquil spot is bright and fair,"
28411,BOOK III.,And Sítá will be happy there.
28412,BOOK III.,"Not far remote from here it lies,"
28413,BOOK III.,"A grove to charm thy loving eyes,"
28414,BOOK III.,Godávarí's pure stream is nigh:
28415,BOOK III.,There Sítá's days will sweetly fly.
28416,BOOK III.,"Pure, lovely, rich in many a charm,"
28417,BOOK III.,"O hero of the mighty arm,"
28418,BOOK III.,"'Tis gay with every plant and fruit,"
28419,BOOK III.,And throngs of gay buds never mute.
28420,BOOK III.,"Thou, true to virtue's path, hast might"
28421,BOOK III.,"To screen each trusting anchorite,"
28422,BOOK III.,And wilt from thy new home defend
28423,BOOK III.,The hermits who on thee depend.
28424,BOOK III.,"Now yonder, Prince, direct thine eyes"
28425,BOOK III.,Where dense Madhúka(442) woods arise:
28426,BOOK III.,"Pierce their dark shade, and issuing forth"
28427,BOOK III.,Turn to a fig-tree on the north:
28428,BOOK III.,Then onward up a sloping mead
28429,BOOK III.,Flanked by a hill the way will lead:
28430,BOOK III.,"There Panchavatí, ever gay"
28431,BOOK III.,"With ceaseless bloom, thy steps will stay."""
28432,BOOK III.,
28433,BOOK III.,The hermit ceased: the princely two
28434,BOOK III.,With seemly honours bade adieu:
28435,BOOK III.,With reverential awe each youth
28436,BOOK III.,"Bowed to the saint whose word was truth,"
28437,BOOK III.,"And then, dismissed with Sítá, they"
28438,BOOK III.,To Panchavatí took their way.
28439,BOOK III.,Thus when each royal prince had grasped
28440,BOOK III.,"His warrior's mighty bow, and clasped"
28441,BOOK III.,"His quiver to his side,"
28442,BOOK III.,With watchful eyes along the road
28443,BOOK III.,"The glorious saint Agastya showed,"
28444,BOOK III.,"Dauntless in fight the brothers strode,"

28452,BOOK III.,
28453,BOOK III.,Then as the son of Raghu made
28454,BOOK III.,"His way to Panchavatí's shade,"
28455,BOOK III.,A mighty vulture he beheld
28456,BOOK III.,Of size and strength unparalleled.
28457,BOOK III.,"The princes, when the bird they saw,"
28458,BOOK III.,"Approached with reverence and awe,"
28459,BOOK III.,"And as his giant form they eyed,"
28460,BOOK III.,"""Tell who thou art,"" in wonder cried."
28461,BOOK III.,"The bird, as though their hearts to gain,"
28462,BOOK III.,Addressed them thus in gentlest strain;
28463,BOOK III.,"""In me, dear sons, the friend behold"
28464,BOOK III.,"Your royal father loved of old."""
28465,BOOK III.,
28466,BOOK III.,He spoke: nor long did Ráma wait
28467,BOOK III.,His sire's dear friend to venerate:
28468,BOOK III.,He bade the bird declare his name
28469,BOOK III.,And the high race of which he came.
28470,BOOK III.,"When Raghu's son had spoken, he"
28471,BOOK III.,"Declared his name and pedigree,"
28472,BOOK III.,His words prolonging to disclose
28473,BOOK III.,How all the things that be arose:
28474,BOOK III.,
28475,BOOK III.,"""List while I tell, O Raghu's son,"
28476,BOOK III.,"The first-born Fathers, one by one,"
28477,BOOK III.,"Great Lords of Life, whence all in earth"

28481,BOOK III.,"With Sesha, Sansray next in line,"
28482,BOOK III.,And Bahuputra's might divine.

28500,BOOK III.,Delighted to each tender bride:
28501,BOOK III.,"""Sons shalt thou bear, to rule the three"

28503,BOOK III.,"Aditi, Diti, and Danú"

28527,BOOK III.,"Then Kraunchí bare the crane and owl,"
28528,BOOK III.,And Bhásí tribes of water fowl:

28561,BOOK III.,Next Surabhí the Goddess bore
28562,BOOK III.,"Two heavenly maids, O Prince, of yore,"

28564,BOOK III.,And her sweet sister Rohiní.
28565,BOOK III.,"With kine this daughter filled each mead,"

28567,BOOK III.,Surasá bore the serpents:(448) all
28568,BOOK III.,The snakes Kadrú their mother call.
28569,BOOK III.,"Then Manu, high-souled Kasyap's(449) wife,"
28570,BOOK III.,"To all the race of men gave life,"
28571,BOOK III.,"The Bráhmans first, the Kshatriya caste,"
28572,BOOK III.,"Then Vaisyas, and the Súdras last."
28573,BOOK III.,Sprang from her mouth the Bráhman race;

28575,BOOK III.,"The Vaisyas from her thighs, 'tis said,"
28576,BOOK III.,The Súdras from her feet were bred.
28577,BOOK III.,From Analá all trees that hang

28579,BOOK III.,The child of beauteous Sukí bore
28580,BOOK III.,"Vinatá, as I taught before:"
28581,BOOK III.,And Surasá and Kadrú were
28582,BOOK III.,"Born of one dame, a noble pair."
28583,BOOK III.,Kadrú gave birth to countless snakes
28584,BOOK III.,That roam the earth in woods and brakes.
28585,BOOK III.,Arun and Garud swift of flight

28603,BOOK III.,He hastened to his trusted friend
28604,BOOK III.,"His darling to confide,"

28627,BOOK III.,"Now, brother, bend thine eyes around;"
28628,BOOK III.,With skilful glance survey the ground:

28649,BOOK III.,"He stood within that calm retreat,"
28650,BOOK III.,"A shade for hermits' home most meet,"
28651,BOOK III.,"And thus Sumitrá's son addressed,"
28652,BOOK III.,While his dear hand in his he pressed:
28653,BOOK III.,
28654,BOOK III.,"""See, see this smooth and lovely glade"
28655,BOOK III.,Which flowery trees encircling shade:
28656,BOOK III.,"Do thou, beloved Lakshman rear"
28657,BOOK III.,A pleasant cot to lodge us here.
28658,BOOK III.,I see beyond that feathery brake
28659,BOOK III.,"The gleaming of a lilied lake,"
28660,BOOK III.,Where flowers in sunlike glory throw
28661,BOOK III.,Fresh odours from the wave below.
28662,BOOK III.,"Agastya's words now find we true,"
28663,BOOK III.,He told the charms which here we view:

28666,BOOK III.,Whose pleasant flood from side to side
28667,BOOK III.,"With swans and geese is beautified,"
28668,BOOK III.,And fair banks crowded with the deer
28669,BOOK III.,That steal from every covert near.
28670,BOOK III.,The peacock's cry is loud and shrill
28671,BOOK III.,"From many a tall and lovely hill,"
28672,BOOK III.,Green-belted by the trees that wave
28673,BOOK III.,Full blossoms o'er the rock and cave.
28674,BOOK III.,Like elephants whose huge fronts glow
28675,BOOK III.,"With painted streaks, the mountains show"
28676,BOOK III.,Long lines of gold and silver sheen
28677,BOOK III.,With copper's darker hues between.
28678,BOOK III.,"With every tree each hill is graced,"
28679,BOOK III.,Where creepers blossom interlaced.
28680,BOOK III.,"Look where the Sál's long branches sway,"
28681,BOOK III.,And palms their fanlike leaves display;
28682,BOOK III.,"The date-tree and the Jak are near,"

28695,BOOK III.,Raised by his toil a cottage stood
28696,BOOK III.,"To shelter Ráma in the wood,"
28697,BOOK III.,"Of ample size, with leaves o'erlaid,"
28698,BOOK III.,Of hardened earth the walls were made.

28703,BOOK III.,Then Samí(451) boughs he deftly spread
28704,BOOK III.,"Enlaced with knotted cord o'erhead,"
28705,BOOK III.,Well thatched above from ridge to eaves
28706,BOOK III.,"With holy grass, and reed, and leaves."
28707,BOOK III.,The mighty chief with careful toil
28708,BOOK III.,Had cleared the ground and smoothed the soil
28709,BOOK III.,"Where now, his loving labour done,"
28710,BOOK III.,Rose a fair home for Raghu's son.
28711,BOOK III.,"Then when his work was duly wrought,"
28712,BOOK III.,"Godávarís sweet stream he sought,"
28713,BOOK III.,"Bathed, plucked the lilies, and a store"
28714,BOOK III.,Of fruit and berries homeward bore.
28715,BOOK III.,"Then sacrifice he duly paid,"
28716,BOOK III.,"And wooed the Gods their hopes to aid,"
28717,BOOK III.,And then to Ráma proudly showed
28718,BOOK III.,The cot prepared for his abode.
28719,BOOK III.,Then Raghu's son with Sítá gazed
28720,BOOK III.,"Upon the home his hands had raised,"
28721,BOOK III.,And transport thrilled his bosom through
28722,BOOK III.,His leafy hermitage to view.
28723,BOOK III.,The glorious son of Raghu round
28724,BOOK III.,"His brother's neck his arms enwound,"
28725,BOOK III.,And thus began his sweet address
28726,BOOK III.,Of deep-felt joy and gentleness:
28727,BOOK III.,"""Well pleased am I, dear lord, to see"
28728,BOOK III.,This noble work performed by thee.
28729,BOOK III.,"For this,--sole grace I can bestow,--"
28730,BOOK III.,About thy neck mine arms I throw.
28731,BOOK III.,"So wise art thou, thy breast is filled"
28732,BOOK III.,"With grateful thoughts, in duty skilled,"
28733,BOOK III.,"Our mighty father, free from stain,"
28734,BOOK III.,"In thee, his offspring, lives again."""
28735,BOOK III.,
28736,BOOK III.,"Thus spoke the prince, who lent a grace"
28737,BOOK III.,"To fortune, pride of Raghu's race;"
28738,BOOK III.,Then in that spot whose pleasant shade
28739,BOOK III.,"Gave store of fruit, content he stayed."
28740,BOOK III.,With Lakshman and his Maithil spouse
28741,BOOK III.,"He spent his day's neath sheltering boughs,"
28742,BOOK III.,As happy as a God on high
28743,BOOK III.,Lives in his mansion in the sky.
28744,BOOK III.,
28745,BOOK III.,
28746,BOOK III.,
28747,BOOK III.,
28748,BOOK III.,Canto XVI. Winter.
28749,BOOK III.,
28750,BOOK III.,
28751,BOOK III.,While there the high-souled hero spent
28752,BOOK III.,"His tranquil hours in sweet content,"
28753,BOOK III.,"The glowing autumn passed, and then"
28754,BOOK III.,Came winter so beloved of men.
28755,BOOK III.,
28756,BOOK III.,"One morn, to bathe, at break of day"
28757,BOOK III.,To the fair stream he took his way.
28758,BOOK III.,"Behind him, with the Maithil dame"
28759,BOOK III.,"Bearing a pitcher Lakshman came,"
28760,BOOK III.,And as he went the mighty man
28761,BOOK III.,Thus to his brother chief began:
28762,BOOK III.,
28763,BOOK III.,"""The time is come, to thee more dear"
28764,BOOK III.,Than all the months that mark the year:
28765,BOOK III.,"The gracious seasons' joy and pride,"
28766,BOOK III.,By which the rest are glorified.
28767,BOOK III.,A robe of hoary rime is spread
28768,BOOK III.,"O'er earth, with corn engarlanded."
28769,BOOK III.,"The streams we loved no longer please,"
28770,BOOK III.,But near the fire we take our ease.
28771,BOOK III.,Now pious men to God and shade
28772,BOOK III.,"Offer young corn's fresh sprouted blade,"
28773,BOOK III.,And purge away their sins with rice
28774,BOOK III.,Bestowed in humble sacrifice.
28775,BOOK III.,"Rich stores of milk delight the swain,"
28776,BOOK III.,"And hearts are cheered that longed for gain,"
28777,BOOK III.,Proud kings whose breasts for conquests glow
28778,BOOK III.,Lead bannered troops to smite the foe.
28779,BOOK III.,Dark is the north: the Lord of Day
28780,BOOK III.,To Yáma's south(452) has turned away:
28781,BOOK III.,"And she--sad widow--shines no more,"
28782,BOOK III.,Reft of the bridal mark(453) she wore.
28783,BOOK III.,"Himálaya's hill, ordained of old"
28784,BOOK III.,"The treasure-house of frost and cold,"
28785,BOOK III.,"Scarce conscious of the feebler glow,"
28786,BOOK III.,Is truly now the Lord of Snow.
28787,BOOK III.,Warmed by the noontide's genial rays
28788,BOOK III.,Delightful are the glorious days:
28789,BOOK III.,But how we shudder at the chill
28790,BOOK III.,Of evening shadows and the rill!
28791,BOOK III.,"How weak the sun, how cold the breeze!"
28792,BOOK III.,How white the rime on grass and trees!
28793,BOOK III.,"The leaves are sere, the woods have lost"
28794,BOOK III.,Their blossoms killed by nipping frost.
28795,BOOK III.,Neath open skies we sleep no more:
28796,BOOK III.,December's nights with rime are hoar:
28797,BOOK III.,Their triple watch(454) in length extends
28798,BOOK III.,With hours the shortened daylight lends.
28799,BOOK III.,No more the moon's sun-borrowed rays
28800,BOOK III.,"Are bright, involved in misty haze,"
28801,BOOK III.,As when upon the mirror's sheen
28802,BOOK III.,The breath's obscuring cloud is seen.
28803,BOOK III.,E'en at the full the faint beams fail
28804,BOOK III.,To struggle through the darksome veil:
28805,BOOK III.,"Changed like her hue, they want the grace"
28806,BOOK III.,That parts not yet from Sítá's face.
28807,BOOK III.,"Cold is the western wind, but how"
28808,BOOK III.,"Its piercing chill is heightened now,"
28809,BOOK III.,Blowing at early morning twice
28810,BOOK III.,As furious with its breath of ice!
28811,BOOK III.,See how the dewy tears they weep
28812,BOOK III.,"The barley, wheat, and woodland steep,"
28813,BOOK III.,"Where, as the sun goes up the sky,"
28814,BOOK III.,The curlew and the sáras cry.
28815,BOOK III.,See where the rice plants scarce uphold
28816,BOOK III.,"Their full ears tinged with paly gold,"
28817,BOOK III.,Bending their ripe heads slowly down
28818,BOOK III.,Fair as the date tree's flowery crown.
28819,BOOK III.,Though now the sun has mounted high
28820,BOOK III.,"Seeking the forehead of the sky,"
28821,BOOK III.,"Such mist obscures his struggling beams,"
28822,BOOK III.,No bigger than the moon he seems.
28823,BOOK III.,"Though weak at first, his rays at length"
28824,BOOK III.,"Grow pleasant in their noonday strength,"
28825,BOOK III.,And where a while they chance to fall
28826,BOOK III.,Fling a faint splendour over all.
28827,BOOK III.,"See, o'er the woods where grass is wet"
28828,BOOK III.,"With hoary drops that cling there yet,"
28829,BOOK III.,With soft light clothing earth and bough
28830,BOOK III.,There steals a tender glory now.
28831,BOOK III.,"Yon elephant who longs to drink,"
28832,BOOK III.,"Still standing on the river's brink,"
28833,BOOK III.,Plucks back his trunk in shivering haste
28834,BOOK III.,From the cold wave he fain would taste.
28835,BOOK III.,The very fowl that haunt the mere
28836,BOOK III.,"Stand doubtful on the bank, and fear"
28837,BOOK III.,To dip them in the wintry wave
28838,BOOK III.,As cowards dread to meet the brave.
28839,BOOK III.,"The frost of night, the rime of dawn"
28840,BOOK III.,Bind flowerless trees and glades of lawn:
28841,BOOK III.,Benumbed in apathetic chill
28842,BOOK III.,Of icy chains they slumber still.
28843,BOOK III.,You hear the hidden sáras cry
28844,BOOK III.,"From floods that wrapped in vapour lie,"
28845,BOOK III.,And frosty-shining sands reveal
28846,BOOK III.,Where the unnoticed rivers steal.
28847,BOOK III.,"The hoary rime of dewy night,"
28848,BOOK III.,And suns that glow with tempered light
28849,BOOK III.,Lend fresh cool flavours to the rill
28850,BOOK III.,That sparkles from the topmost hill.
28851,BOOK III.,The cold has killed the lily's pride:
28852,BOOK III.,"Leaf, filament, and flower have died:"
28853,BOOK III.,"With chilling breath rude winds have blown,"
28854,BOOK III.,The withered stalk is left alone.
28855,BOOK III.,"At this gay time, O noblest chief,"
28856,BOOK III.,"The faithful Bharat, worn by grief,"
28857,BOOK III.,Lives in the royal town where he
28858,BOOK III.,Spends weary hours for love of thee.
28859,BOOK III.,"From titles, honour, kingly sway,"
28860,BOOK III.,From every joy he turns away:
28861,BOOK III.,"Couched on cold earth, his days are passed"
28862,BOOK III.,With scanty fare and hermit's fast.
28863,BOOK III.,This moment from his humble bed
28864,BOOK III.,"He lifts, perhaps, his weary head,"
28865,BOOK III.,And girt by many a follower goes
28866,BOOK III.,To bathe where silver Sarjú flows.
28867,BOOK III.,"How, when the frosty morn is dim,"
28868,BOOK III.,Shall Sarjú be a bath for him
28869,BOOK III.,"Nursed with all love and tender care,"
28870,BOOK III.,So delicate and young and fair.
28871,BOOK III.,How bright his hue! his brilliant eye
28872,BOOK III.,With the broad lotus leaf may vie.
28873,BOOK III.,"By fortune stamped for happy fate,"
28874,BOOK III.,His graceful form is tall and straight.
28875,BOOK III.,"In duty skilled, his words are truth:"
28876,BOOK III.,He proudly rules each lust of youth.
28877,BOOK III.,"Though his strong arm smites down the foe,"
28878,BOOK III.,In gentle speech his accents flow.
28879,BOOK III.,Yet every joy has he resigned
28880,BOOK III.,And cleaves to thee with heart and mind.
28881,BOOK III.,Thus by the deeds that he has done
28882,BOOK III.,"A name in heaven has Bharat won,"
28883,BOOK III.,For in his life he follows yet
28884,BOOK III.,"Thy steps, O banished anchoret."
28885,BOOK III.,"Thus faithful Bharat, nobly wise,"
28886,BOOK III.,The proverb of the world belies:
28887,BOOK III.,"""No men, by mothers' guidance led,"
28888,BOOK III.,"The footsteps of their fathers tread."""
28889,BOOK III.,"How could Kaikeyí, blest to be"
28890,BOOK III.,"Spouse of the king our sire, and see"
28891,BOOK III.,"A son like virtuous Bharat, blot"
28892,BOOK III.,"Her glory with so foul a plot!"""
28893,BOOK III.,
28894,BOOK III.,"Thus in fraternal love he spoke,"
28895,BOOK III.,And from his lips reproaches broke:
28896,BOOK III.,But Ráma grieved to hear him chide
28897,BOOK III.,"The absent mother, and replied:"
28898,BOOK III.,
28899,BOOK III.,"""Cease, O beloved, cease to blame"
28900,BOOK III.,Our royal father's second dame.
28901,BOOK III.,Still speak of Bharat first in place
28902,BOOK III.,Of old Ikshváku's princely race.
28903,BOOK III.,"My heart, so firmly bent but now"
28904,BOOK III.,"To dwell in woods and keep my vow,"
28905,BOOK III.,Half melting as I hear thee speak
28906,BOOK III.,"Of Bharat's love, grows soft and weak,"
28907,BOOK III.,With tender joy I bring to mind
28908,BOOK III.,His speeches ever sweet and kind.
28909,BOOK III.,That dear as Amrit took the sense
28910,BOOK III.,With most enchanting influence.
28911,BOOK III.,"Ah, when shall I, no more to part,"
28912,BOOK III.,Meet Bharat of the mighty heart?
28913,BOOK III.,"When, O my brother, when shall we"
28914,BOOK III.,"The good and brave Satrughna see?"""
28915,BOOK III.,Thus as he poured his fond lament
28916,BOOK III.,The son of Raghu onward went:
28917,BOOK III.,"They reached the river, and the three"
28918,BOOK III.,Bathed them in fair Godávarí.
28919,BOOK III.,Libations of the stream they paid
28920,BOOK III.,"To every deity and shade,"
28921,BOOK III.,"With hymns of praise, the Sun on high"
28922,BOOK III.,And sinless Gods to glorify.
28923,BOOK III.,Fresh from the purifying tide
28924,BOOK III.,"Resplendent Ráma came,"
28925,BOOK III.,"With Lakshman ever by his side,"
28926,BOOK III.,And the sweet Maithil dame.
28927,BOOK III.,"So Rudra shines by worlds adored,"
28928,BOOK III.,"In glory undefiled,"
28929,BOOK III.,"When Nandi(455) stands beside his lord,"
28930,BOOK III.,And King Himálaya's child.(456)
28931,BOOK III.,
28932,BOOK III.,
28933,BOOK III.,
28934,BOOK III.,
28935,BOOK III.,Canto XVII. Súrpanakhá.
28936,BOOK III.,
28937,BOOK III.,
28938,BOOK III.,The bathing and the prayer were o'er;
28939,BOOK III.,"He turned him from the grassy shore,"
28940,BOOK III.,And with his brother and his spouse
28941,BOOK III.,Sought his fair home beneath the boughs.
28942,BOOK III.,"Sítá and Lakshman by his side,"
28943,BOOK III.,"On to his cot the hero hied,"
28944,BOOK III.,And after rites at morning due
28945,BOOK III.,Within the leafy shade withdrew.
28946,BOOK III.,"Then, honoured by the devotees,"
28947,BOOK III.,"As royal Ráma sat at ease,"
28948,BOOK III.,"With Sítá near him, o'er his head"
28949,BOOK III.,"A canopy of green boughs spread,"
28950,BOOK III.,He shone as shines the Lord of Night
28951,BOOK III.,"By Chitrá's(457) side, his dear delight."
28952,BOOK III.,With Lakshman there he sat and told
28953,BOOK III.,"Sweet stories of the days of old,"
28954,BOOK III.,And as the pleasant time he spent
28955,BOOK III.,"With heart upon each tale intent,"
28956,BOOK III.,"A giantess, by fancy led,"
28957,BOOK III.,Came wandering to his leafy shed.
28958,BOOK III.,"Fierce Súrpanakhá,--her of yore"
28959,BOOK III.,"The Ten-necked tyrant's mother bore,--"
28960,BOOK III.,Saw Ráma with his noble mien
28961,BOOK III.,Bright as the Gods in heaven are seen;
28962,BOOK III.,"Him from whose brow a glory gleamed,"
28963,BOOK III.,Like lotus leaves his full eyes beamed:
28964,BOOK III.,"Long-armed, of elephantine gait,"
28965,BOOK III.,With hair close coiled in hermit plait:
28966,BOOK III.,"In youthful vigour, nobly framed,"
28967,BOOK III.,By glorious marks a king proclaimed:
28968,BOOK III.,"Like some bright lotus lustrous-hued,"
28969,BOOK III.,With young Kandarpa's(458) grace endued:
28970,BOOK III.,"As there like Indra's self he shone,"
28971,BOOK III.,She loved the youth she gazed upon.
28972,BOOK III.,She grim of eye and foul of face
28973,BOOK III.,Loved his sweet glance and forehead's grace:
28974,BOOK III.,"She of unlovely figure, him"
28975,BOOK III.,Of stately form and shapely limb:
28976,BOOK III.,"She whose dim locks disordered hung,"
28977,BOOK III.,Him whose bright hair on high brows clung:
28978,BOOK III.,"She whose fierce accents counselled fear,"
28979,BOOK III.,Him whose soft tones were sweet to hear:
28980,BOOK III.,"She whose dire form with age was dried,"
28981,BOOK III.,Him radiant in his youthful pride:
28982,BOOK III.,"She whose false lips maintained the wrong,"
28983,BOOK III.,Him in the words of virtue strong:
28984,BOOK III.,"She cruel-hearted, stained with sin,"
28985,BOOK III.,Him just in deed and pure within.
28986,BOOK III.,"She, hideous fiend, a thing to hate,"
28987,BOOK III.,Him formed each eye to captivate:
28988,BOOK III.,"Fierce passion in her bosom woke,"
28989,BOOK III.,And thus to Raghu's son she spoke:
28990,BOOK III.,
28991,BOOK III.,"""With matted hair above thy brows,"
28992,BOOK III.,"With bow and shaft and this thy spouse,"
28993,BOOK III.,How hast thou sought in hermit dress
28994,BOOK III.,The giant-haunted wilderness?
28995,BOOK III.,What dost thou here? The cause explain:
28996,BOOK III.,"Why art thou come, and what to gain?"""
28997,BOOK III.,"As Súrpanakhá questioned so,"
28998,BOOK III.,"Ráma, the terror of the foe,"
28999,BOOK III.,"In answer to the monster's call,"
29000,BOOK III.,With fearless candour told her all.
29001,BOOK III.,"""King Dasaratha reigned of old,"
29002,BOOK III.,Like Gods celestial brave and bold.
29003,BOOK III.,"I am his eldest son and heir,"
29004,BOOK III.,And Ráma is the name I bear.
29005,BOOK III.,"This brother, Lakshman, younger born,"
29006,BOOK III.,Most faithful love to me has sworn.
29007,BOOK III.,"My wife, this princess, dear to fame,"
29008,BOOK III.,Is Sitá the Videhan dame.
29009,BOOK III.,Obedient to my sire's behest
29010,BOOK III.,"And by the queen my mother pressed,"
29011,BOOK III.,"To keep the law and merit win,"
29012,BOOK III.,I sought this wood to harbour in.
29013,BOOK III.,"But speak, for I of thee in turn"
29014,BOOK III.,"Thy name, and race, and sire would learn."
29015,BOOK III.,"Thou art of giant race, I ween."
29016,BOOK III.,Changing at will thy form and mien.
29017,BOOK III.,"Speak truly, and the cause declare"
29018,BOOK III.,"That bids thee to these shades repair."""
29019,BOOK III.,
29020,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma spoke: the demon heard,"
29021,BOOK III.,And thus replied by passion spurred:
29022,BOOK III.,"""Of giant race, what form soe'er"
29023,BOOK III.,"My fancy wills, 'tis mine to wear."
29024,BOOK III.,"Named Súrpanakhá here I stray,"
29025,BOOK III.,And where I walk spread wild dismay.
29026,BOOK III.,King Rávan is my brother: fame
29027,BOOK III.,"Has taught perchance his dreaded name,"
29028,BOOK III.,Strong Kumbhakarna slumbering deep
29029,BOOK III.,In chains of never-ending sleep:
29030,BOOK III.,"Vibhíshan of the duteous mind,"
29031,BOOK III.,In needs unlike his giant kind:
29032,BOOK III.,"Dúshan and Khara, brave and bold"
29033,BOOK III.,Whose fame by every tongue is told:
29034,BOOK III.,Their might by mine is far surpassed;
29035,BOOK III.,"But when, O best of men, I cast"
29036,BOOK III.,"These fond eyes on thy form, I see"
29037,BOOK III.,My chosen love and lord in thee.
29038,BOOK III.,Endowed with wondrous might am I:
29039,BOOK III.,Where'er my fancy leads I fly.
29040,BOOK III.,"The poor misshapen Sítá leave,"
29041,BOOK III.,"And me, thy worthier bride receive."
29042,BOOK III.,"Look on my beauty, and prefer"
29043,BOOK III.,A spouse more meet than one like her:
29044,BOOK III.,I'll eat that ill-formed woman there:
29045,BOOK III.,Thy brother too her fate shall share.
29046,BOOK III.,"But come, beloved, thou shalt roam"
29047,BOOK III.,With me through all our woodland home;
29048,BOOK III.,"Each varied grove with me shalt seek,"
29049,BOOK III.,"And gaze upon each mountain peak."""
29050,BOOK III.,
29051,BOOK III.,"As thus she spoke, the monster gazed"
29052,BOOK III.,With sparkling eyes where passion blazed:
29053,BOOK III.,"Then he, in lore of language learned,"
29054,BOOK III.,This answer eloquent returned:
29055,BOOK III.,
29056,BOOK III.,
29057,BOOK III.,
29058,BOOK III.,
29059,BOOK III.,Canto XVIII. The Mutilation.
29060,BOOK III.,
29061,BOOK III.,
29062,BOOK III.,On her ensnared in Káma's net
29063,BOOK III.,"His eyes the royal Ráma set,"
29064,BOOK III.,"And thus, her passion to beguile,"
29065,BOOK III.,Addressed her with a gentle smile:
29066,BOOK III.,
29067,BOOK III.,"""I have a wife: behold her here,"
29068,BOOK III.,My Sítá ever true and dear:
29069,BOOK III.,And one like thee will never brook
29070,BOOK III.,Upon a rival spouse to look.
29071,BOOK III.,But there my brother Lakshman stands:
29072,BOOK III.,Unchained is he by nuptial bands:
29073,BOOK III.,"A youth heroic, loved of all,"
29074,BOOK III.,"Gracious and gallant, fair and tall."
29075,BOOK III.,"With winning looks, most nobly bred,"
29076,BOOK III.,"Unmatched till now, he longs to wed."
29077,BOOK III.,"Meet to enjoy thy youthful charms,"
29078,BOOK III.,O take him to thy loving arms.
29079,BOOK III.,"Enamoured on his bosom lie,"
29080,BOOK III.,"Fair damsel of the radiant eye,"
29081,BOOK III.,As the warm sunlight loves to rest
29082,BOOK III.,"Upon her darling Meru's breast."""
29083,BOOK III.,
29084,BOOK III.,"The hero spoke, the monster heard,"
29085,BOOK III.,While passion still her bosom stirred.
29086,BOOK III.,"Away from Ráma's side she broke,"
29087,BOOK III.,And thus in turn to Lakshman spoke:
29088,BOOK III.,"""Come, for thy bride take me who shine"
29089,BOOK III.,In fairest grace that suits with thine.
29090,BOOK III.,Thou by my side from grove to grove
29091,BOOK III.,"Of Dandak's wild in bliss shalt rove."""
29092,BOOK III.,
29093,BOOK III.,"Then Lakshman, skilled in soft address,"
29094,BOOK III.,"Wooed by the amorous giantess,"
29095,BOOK III.,"With art to turn her love aside,"
29096,BOOK III.,To Súrpanakhá thus replied:
29097,BOOK III.,
29098,BOOK III.,"""And can so high a dame agree"
29099,BOOK III.,The slave-wife of a slave to be?
29100,BOOK III.,"I, lotus-hued! in good and ill"
29101,BOOK III.,Am bondsman to my brother's will.
29102,BOOK III.,"Be thou, fair creature radiant-eyed,"
29103,BOOK III.,My honoured brother's younger bride:
29104,BOOK III.,"With faultless tint and dainty limb,"
29105,BOOK III.,"A happy wife, bring joy to him."
29106,BOOK III.,"He from his spouse grown old and grey,"
29107,BOOK III.,"Deformed, untrue, will turn away,"
29108,BOOK III.,"Her withered charms will gladly leave,"
29109,BOOK III.,And to his fair young darling cleave.
29110,BOOK III.,"For who could be so fond and blind,"
29111,BOOK III.,"O loveliest of all female kind,"
29112,BOOK III.,To love another dame and slight
29113,BOOK III.,"Thy beauties rich in all delight?"""
29114,BOOK III.,
29115,BOOK III.,Thus Lakshman praised in scornful jest
29116,BOOK III.,"The long-toothed fiend with loathly breast,"
29117,BOOK III.,"Who fondly heard his speech, nor knew"
29118,BOOK III.,His mocking words were aught but true.
29119,BOOK III.,Again inflamed with love she fled
29120,BOOK III.,"To Ráma, in his leafy shed"
29121,BOOK III.,"Where Sítá rested by his side,"
29122,BOOK III.,And to the mighty victor cried:
29123,BOOK III.,
29124,BOOK III.,"""What, Ráma, canst thou blindly cling"
29125,BOOK III.,To this old false misshapen thing?
29126,BOOK III.,Wilt thou refuse the charms of youth
29127,BOOK III.,For withered breast and grinning tooth!
29128,BOOK III.,Canst thou this wretched creature prize
29129,BOOK III.,And look on me with scornful eyes?
29130,BOOK III.,This aged crone this very hour
29131,BOOK III.,Before thy face will I devour:
29132,BOOK III.,"Then joyous, from all rivals free."
29133,BOOK III.,"Through Dandak will I stray with thee."""
29134,BOOK III.,
29135,BOOK III.,"She spoke, and with a glance of flame"
29136,BOOK III.,Rushed on the fawn-eyed Maithil dame:
29137,BOOK III.,So would a horrid meteor mar
29138,BOOK III.,Fair Rohiní's soft beaming star.
29139,BOOK III.,"But as the furious fiend drew near,"
29140,BOOK III.,"Like Death's dire noose which chills with fear,"
29141,BOOK III.,"The mighty chief her purpose stayed,"
29142,BOOK III.,"And spoke, his brother to upbraid:"
29143,BOOK III.,"""Ne'er should we jest with creatures rude,"
29144,BOOK III.,Of savage race and wrathful mood.
29145,BOOK III.,"Think, Lakshman, think how nearly slain"
29146,BOOK III.,My dear Videhan breathes again.
29147,BOOK III.,Let not the hideous wretch escape
29148,BOOK III.,Without a mark to mar her shape.
29149,BOOK III.,"Strike, lord of men, the monstrous fiend,"
29150,BOOK III.,"Deformed, and foul, and evil-miened."""
29151,BOOK III.,
29152,BOOK III.,"He spoke: then Lakshman's wrath rose high,"
29153,BOOK III.,"And there before his brother's eye,"
29154,BOOK III.,"He drew that sword which none could stay,"
29155,BOOK III.,And cleft her nose and ears away.
29156,BOOK III.,"Noseless and earless, torn and maimed,"
29157,BOOK III.,"With fearful shrieks the fiend exclaimed,"
29158,BOOK III.,And frantic in her wild distress
29159,BOOK III.,Resought the distant wilderness.
29160,BOOK III.,"Deformed, terrific, huge, and dread,"
29161,BOOK III.,"As on she moved, her gashes bled,"
29162,BOOK III.,And groan succeeded groan as loud
29163,BOOK III.,"As roars, ere rain, the thunder cloud."
29164,BOOK III.,"Still on the fearful monster passed,"
29165,BOOK III.,"While streams of blood kept falling fast,"
29166,BOOK III.,"And with a roar, and arms outspread"
29167,BOOK III.,Within the boundless wood she fled.
29168,BOOK III.,To Janasthán the monster flew;
29169,BOOK III.,"Fierce Khara there she found,"
29170,BOOK III.,With chieftains of the giant crew
29171,BOOK III.,In thousands ranged around.
29172,BOOK III.,Before his awful feet she bent
29173,BOOK III.,"And fell with piercing cries,"
29174,BOOK III.,As when a bolt in swift descent
29175,BOOK III.,Comes flashing from the skies.
29176,BOOK III.,There for a while with senses dazed
29177,BOOK III.,Silent she lay and scared:
29178,BOOK III.,"At length her drooping head she raised,"
29179,BOOK III.,"And all the tale declared,"
29180,BOOK III.,"How Ráma, Lakshman, and the dame"
29181,BOOK III.,Had reached that lonely place:
29182,BOOK III.,"Then told her injuries and shame,"

29192,BOOK III.,"With blood-stained limbs and troubled eye,"

29195,BOOK III.,
29196,BOOK III.,"""Arise, my sister; cast away"

29212,BOOK III.,"What God or fiend this deed has wrought,"
29213,BOOK III.,What bard or sage of lofty thought
29214,BOOK III.,Was armed with power supremely great
29215,BOOK III.,Thy form to mar and mutilate?
29216,BOOK III.,In all the worlds not one I see

29222,BOOK III.,E'en as the thirsty wild swan drains
29223,BOOK III.,Each milk-drop that the wave retains.
29224,BOOK III.,Whose blood in foaming streams shall burst
29225,BOOK III.,"O'er the dry ground which lies athirst,"
29226,BOOK III.,When by my shafts transfixed and slain
29227,BOOK III.,He falls upon the battle plain?
29228,BOOK III.,From whose dead corpse shall birds of air
29229,BOOK III.,"The mangled flesh and sinews tear,"

29244,BOOK III.,Thus Súrpanakhá made reply:
29245,BOOK III.,"""'Tis Dasaratha's sons, a pair"

29249,BOOK III.,"On berries roots and fruit they feed,"

29544,BOOK III.,"Slaves of my will, of fearful might,"
29545,BOOK III.,Who never turn their backs in fight:
29546,BOOK III.,"Fiends who rejoice to slay and mar,"
29547,BOOK III.,Dark as the clouds of autumn are:
29548,BOOK III.,"Make ready quickly, O my friend,"
29549,BOOK III.,My chariot and the bows I bend.
29550,BOOK III.,"My swords, my shafts of brilliant sheen,"
29551,BOOK III.,My divers lances long and keen.
29552,BOOK III.,On to the battle will I lead
29553,BOOK III.,"These heroes of Pulastya's seed,"
29554,BOOK III.,"And thus, O famed for warlike skill,"
29555,BOOK III.,"Ráma my wicked foeman kill."""
29556,BOOK III.,
29557,BOOK III.,"He spoke, and ere his speech was done,"
29558,BOOK III.,"His chariot glittering like the sun,"
29559,BOOK III.,"Yoked and announced, by Dúshan's care,"
29560,BOOK III.,With dappled steeds was ready there.
29561,BOOK III.,High as a peak from Meru rent
29562,BOOK III.,It burned with golden ornament:
29563,BOOK III.,"The pole of lazulite, of gold"
29564,BOOK III.,Were the bright wheels whereon it rolled.
29565,BOOK III.,"With gold and moonstone blazoned o'er,"
29566,BOOK III.,"Fish, flowers, trees, rocks, the panels bore;"
29567,BOOK III.,"Auspicious birds embossed thereon,"
29568,BOOK III.,And stars in costly emblem shone.
29569,BOOK III.,"O'er flashing swords his banner hung,"
29570,BOOK III.,"And sweet bells, ever tinkling, swung."
29571,BOOK III.,That mighty host with sword and shield
29572,BOOK III.,And oar was ready for the field:
29573,BOOK III.,"And Khara saw, and Dúshan cried,"
29574,BOOK III.,"""Forth to the fight, ye giants, ride."""
29575,BOOK III.,"Then banners waved, and shield and sword"
29576,BOOK III.,Flashed as the host obeyed its lord.
29577,BOOK III.,From Janasthán they sallied out
29578,BOOK III.,"With eager speed, and din, and shout,"
29579,BOOK III.,"Armed with the mace for close attacks,"
29580,BOOK III.,"The bill, the spear, the battle-axe,"
29581,BOOK III.,"Steel quoit and club that flashed afar,"
29582,BOOK III.,"Huge bow and sword and scimitar,"
29583,BOOK III.,"The dart to pierce, the bolt to strike,"
29584,BOOK III.,"The murderous bludgeon, lance, and pike."
29585,BOOK III.,"So forth from Janasthán, intent"
29586,BOOK III.,"On Khara's will, the monsters went."
29587,BOOK III.,He saw their awful march: not far
29588,BOOK III.,Behind the host he drove his car.
29589,BOOK III.,"Ware of his master's will, to speed"
29590,BOOK III.,The driver urged each gold-decked steed.
29591,BOOK III.,"Then forth the warrior's coursers sprang,"
29592,BOOK III.,And with tumultuous murmur rang
29593,BOOK III.,Each distant quarter of the sky
29594,BOOK III.,And realms that intermediate lie.
29595,BOOK III.,High and more high within his breast
29596,BOOK III.,"His pride triumphant rose,"
29597,BOOK III.,While terrible as Death he pressed
29598,BOOK III.,"Onward to slay his foes,"
29599,BOOK III.,"""More swiftly yet,"" as on they fled,"
29600,BOOK III.,He cried in thundering tones
29601,BOOK III.,Loud as a cloud that overhead
29602,BOOK III.,Hails down a flood of stones.
29603,BOOK III.,
29604,BOOK III.,

29606,BOOK III.,
29607,BOOK III.,Canto XXIII. The Omens.
29608,BOOK III.,
29609,BOOK III.,
29610,BOOK III.,As forth upon its errand went
29611,BOOK III.,"That huge ferocious armament,"
29612,BOOK III.,"An awful cloud, in dust and gloom,"
29613,BOOK III.,With threatening thunders from its womb
29614,BOOK III.,Poured in sad augury a flood
29615,BOOK III.,Of rushing water mixt with blood.
29616,BOOK III.,"The monarch's steeds, though strong and fleet,"
29617,BOOK III.,Stumbled and fell: and yet their feet
29618,BOOK III.,Passed o'er the bed of flowers that lay
29619,BOOK III.,Fresh gathered on the royal way.
29620,BOOK III.,No gleam of sunlight struggled through
29621,BOOK III.,"The sombre pall of midnight hue,"
29622,BOOK III.,"Edged with a line of bloody red,"
29623,BOOK III.,Like whirling torches overhead.
29624,BOOK III.,"A vulture, fierce, of mighty size."
29625,BOOK III.,"Terrific with his cruel eyes,"
29626,BOOK III.,"Perched on the staff enriched with gold,"
29627,BOOK III.,Whence hung the flag in many a fold.
29628,BOOK III.,"Each ravening bird, each beast of prey"
29629,BOOK III.,"Where Janasthán's wild thickets lay,"
29630,BOOK III.,Rose with a long discordant cry
29631,BOOK III.,And gathered as the host went by.
29632,BOOK III.,"And from the south long, wild, and shrill,"
29633,BOOK III.,Came spirit voices boding ill.
29634,BOOK III.,"Like elephants in frantic mood,"
29635,BOOK III.,"Vast clouds terrific, sable-hued,"
29636,BOOK III.,Hid all the sky where'er they bore
29637,BOOK III.,Their load of water mixt with gore.
29638,BOOK III.,"Above, below, around were spread"
29639,BOOK III.,"Thick shades of darkness strange and dread,"
29640,BOOK III.,Nor could the wildered glance descry
29641,BOOK III.,A point or quarter of the sky.
29642,BOOK III.,"Then came o'er heaven a sanguine hue,"
29643,BOOK III.,"Though evening's flush not yet was due,"
29644,BOOK III.,While each ill-omened bird that flies
29645,BOOK III.,Assailed the king with harshest cries.
29646,BOOK III.,"There screamed the vulture and the crane,"
29647,BOOK III.,And the loud jackal shrieked again.
29648,BOOK III.,Each hideous thing that bodes aright
29649,BOOK III.,"Disaster in the coming fight,"
29650,BOOK III.,"With gaping mouth that hissed and flamed,"
29651,BOOK III.,The ruin of the host proclaimed.
29652,BOOK III.,Eclipse untimely reft away
29653,BOOK III.,"The brightness of the Lord of Day,"
29654,BOOK III.,And near his side was seen to glow
29655,BOOK III.,A mace-like comet boding woe.
29656,BOOK III.,Then while the sun was lost to view
29657,BOOK III.,"A mighty wind arose and blew,"
29658,BOOK III.,"And stars like fireflies shed their light,"
29659,BOOK III.,Nor waited for the distant night.
29660,BOOK III.,"The lilies drooped, the brooks were dried,"
29661,BOOK III.,"The fish and birds that swam them died,"
29662,BOOK III.,And every tree that was so fair
29663,BOOK III.,With flower and fruit was stripped and bare.
29664,BOOK III.,"The wild wind ceased, yet, raised on high,"
29665,BOOK III.,Dark clouds of dust involved the sky.
29666,BOOK III.,In doleful twitter long sustained
29667,BOOK III.,"The restless Sárikás(462) complained,"
29668,BOOK III.,And from the heavens with flash and flame
29669,BOOK III.,Terrific meteors roaring came.
29670,BOOK III.,Earth to her deep foundation shook
29671,BOOK III.,"With rock and tree and plain and brook,"
29672,BOOK III.,"As Khara with triumphant shout,"
29673,BOOK III.,"Borne in his chariot, sallied out."
29674,BOOK III.,His left arm throbbed: he knew full well
29675,BOOK III.,"That omen, and his visage fell."
29676,BOOK III.,"Each awful sign the giant viewed,"
29677,BOOK III.,And sudden tears his eye bedewed.
29678,BOOK III.,"Care on his brow sat chill and black,"
29679,BOOK III.,Yet mad with wrath he turned not back.
29680,BOOK III.,Upon each fearful sight that raised
29681,BOOK III.,"The shuddering hair the chieftain gazed,"
29682,BOOK III.,And laughing in his senseless pride
29683,BOOK III.,Thus to his giant legions cried:
29684,BOOK III.,"""By sense of mightiest strength upborne,"
29685,BOOK III.,These feeble signs I laugh to scorn.
29686,BOOK III.,I could bring down the stars that shine
29687,BOOK III.,In heaven with these keen shafts of mine.
29688,BOOK III.,Impelled by warlike fury I
29689,BOOK III.,Could cause e'en Death himself to die.
29690,BOOK III.,I will not seek my home again
29691,BOOK III.,Until my pointed shafts have slain
29692,BOOK III.,"This Raghu's son so fierce in pride,"
29693,BOOK III.,And Lakshman by his brother's side.
29694,BOOK III.,"And she, my sister, she for whom"
29695,BOOK III.,"These sons of Raghu meet their doom,"
29696,BOOK III.,She with delighted lips shall drain
29697,BOOK III.,The lifeblood of her foemen slain.
29698,BOOK III.,Fear not for me: I ne'er have known
29699,BOOK III.,"Defeat, in battle overthrown."
29700,BOOK III.,"Fear not for me, O giants; true"
29701,BOOK III.,Are the proud words I speak to you.
29702,BOOK III.,"The king of Gods who rules on high,"
29703,BOOK III.,"If wild Airávat bore him nigh,"
29704,BOOK III.,Should fall before me bolt in hand:
29705,BOOK III.,"And shall these two my wrath withstand!"""
29706,BOOK III.,
29707,BOOK III.,He ended and the giant host
29708,BOOK III.,"Who heard their chief's triumphant boast,"
29709,BOOK III.,"Rejoiced with equal pride elate,"
29710,BOOK III.,Entangled in the noose of Fate.
29711,BOOK III.,
29712,BOOK III.,"Then met on high in bright array,"
29713,BOOK III.,"With eyes that longed to see the fray,"
29714,BOOK III.,"God and Gandharva, sage and saint,"
29715,BOOK III.,With beings pure from earthly taint.
29716,BOOK III.,"Blest for good works aforetime wrought,"
29717,BOOK III.,Thus each to other spake his thought:
29718,BOOK III.,"""Now joy to Bráhmans, joy to kine,"
29719,BOOK III.,And all whom world count half divine!
29720,BOOK III.,May Raghu's offspring slay in fight
29721,BOOK III.,"Pulastya's sons who roam by night!"""
29722,BOOK III.,"In words like these and more, the best"
29723,BOOK III.,"Of high-souled saints their hopes expressed,"
29724,BOOK III.,Bending their eager eyes from where
29725,BOOK III.,Car-borne with Gods they rode in air.
29726,BOOK III.,"Beneath them stretching far, they viewed"
29727,BOOK III.,The giants' death-doomed multitude.
29728,BOOK III.,"They saw where, urged with fury, far"
29729,BOOK III.,"Before the host rolled Khara's car,"
29730,BOOK III.,And close beside their leader came
29731,BOOK III.,Twelve giant peers of might and fame.
29732,BOOK III.,Four other chiefs(463) before the rest
29733,BOOK III.,Behind their leader Dúshan pressed.
29734,BOOK III.,"Impetuous, cruel, dark, and dread,"
29735,BOOK III.,"All thirsting for the fray,"
29736,BOOK III.,The hosts of giant warriors sped
29737,BOOK III.,Onward upon their way.
29738,BOOK III.,With eager speed they reached the spot
29739,BOOK III.,"Where dwelt the princely two,--"
29740,BOOK III.,Like planets in a league to blot
29741,BOOK III.,The sun and moon from view.
29742,BOOK III.,
29743,BOOK III.,

29746,BOOK III.,Canto XXIV. The Host In Sight.
29747,BOOK III.,
29748,BOOK III.,
29749,BOOK III.,"While Khara, urged by valiant rage,"
29750,BOOK III.,"Drew near that little hermitage,"
29751,BOOK III.,Those wondrous signs in earth and sky
29752,BOOK III.,Smote on each prince's watchful eye.
29753,BOOK III.,When Ráma saw those signs of woe
29754,BOOK III.,"Fraught with destruction to the foe,"
29755,BOOK III.,With bold impatience scarce repressed
29756,BOOK III.,His brother chief he thus addressed:
29757,BOOK III.,
29758,BOOK III.,"""These fearful signs, my brother bold,"
29759,BOOK III.,"Which threaten all our foes, behold:"
29760,BOOK III.,"All laden, as they strike the view,"
29761,BOOK III.,With ruin to the fiendish crew.
29762,BOOK III.,"The angry clouds are gathering fast,"
29763,BOOK III.,"Their skirts with dusty gloom o'ercast,"
29764,BOOK III.,"And harsh with loud-voiced thunder, rain"
29765,BOOK III.,Thick drops of blood upon the plain.
29766,BOOK III.,"See, burning for the coming fight,"
29767,BOOK III.,"My shafts with wreaths of smoke are white,"
29768,BOOK III.,And my great bow embossed with gold
29769,BOOK III.,Throbs eager for the master's hold.
29770,BOOK III.,Each bird that through the forest flies
29771,BOOK III.,Sends out its melancholy cries.
29772,BOOK III.,"All signs foretell the dangerous strife,"
29773,BOOK III.,The jeopardy of limb and life.
29774,BOOK III.,"Each sight, each sound gives warning clear"
29775,BOOK III.,That foemen meet and death is near.
29776,BOOK III.,"But courage, valiant brother! well"
29777,BOOK III.,The throbbings of mine arm foretell
29778,BOOK III.,"That ruin waits the hostile powers,"
29779,BOOK III.,And triumph in the fight is ours.
29780,BOOK III.,I hail the welcome omen: thou
29781,BOOK III.,Art bright of face and clear of brow.
29782,BOOK III.,"For Lakshman, when the eye can trace"
29783,BOOK III.,A cloud upon the warrior's face
29784,BOOK III.,"Stealing the cheerful light away,"
29785,BOOK III.,His life is doomed in battle fray.
29786,BOOK III.,"List, brother, to that awful cry:"
29787,BOOK III.,With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh.
29788,BOOK III.,With thundering beat of many a drum
29789,BOOK III.,The savage-hearted giants come.
29790,BOOK III.,The wise who value safety know
29791,BOOK III.,"To meet, prepared, the coming blow:"
29792,BOOK III.,In paths of prudence trained aright
29793,BOOK III.,They watch the stroke before it smite.
29794,BOOK III.,"Take thou thine arrows and thy bow,"
29795,BOOK III.,And with the Maithil lady go
29796,BOOK III.,For shelter to the mountain cave
29797,BOOK III.,Where thickest trees their branches wave.
29798,BOOK III.,"I will not have thee, Lakshman, say"
29799,BOOK III.,"One word in answer, but obey."
29800,BOOK III.,By all thy honour for these feet
29801,BOOK III.,"Of mine, dear brother, I entreat."
29802,BOOK III.,"Thy warlike arm, I know could, smite"
29803,BOOK III.,To death these rovers of the night;
29804,BOOK III.,But I this day would fight alone
29805,BOOK III.,"Till all the fiends be overthrown."""
29806,BOOK III.,He spake: and Lakshman answered naught:
29807,BOOK III.,"His arrows and his bow he brought,"
29808,BOOK III.,And then with Sítá following hied
29809,BOOK III.,For shelter to the mountain side.
29810,BOOK III.,As Lakshman and the lady through
29811,BOOK III.,"The forest to the cave withdrew,"
29812,BOOK III.,"""'Tis well,"" cried Ráma. Then he braced"
29813,BOOK III.,His coat of mail around his waist.
29814,BOOK III.,"When, bright as blazing fire, upon"
29815,BOOK III.,"His mighty limbs that armour shone,"
29816,BOOK III.,The hero stood like some great light
29817,BOOK III.,Uprising in the dark of night.
29818,BOOK III.,His dreadful shafts were by his side;
29819,BOOK III.,"His trusty bow he bent and plied,"
29820,BOOK III.,"Prepared he stood: the bowstring rang,"
29821,BOOK III.,Filling the welkin with the clang.
29822,BOOK III.,
29823,BOOK III.,The high-souled Gods together drew
29824,BOOK III.,"The wonder of the fight to view,"
29825,BOOK III.,"The saints made free from spot and stain,"
29826,BOOK III.,And bright Gandharvas' heavenly train.
29827,BOOK III.,"Each glorious sage the assembly sought,"
29828,BOOK III.,"Each saint divine of loftiest thought,"
29829,BOOK III.,And filled with zeal for Ráma's sake.
29830,BOOK III.,Thus they whose deeds were holy spake:
29831,BOOK III.,
29832,BOOK III.,"""Now be it well with Bráhmans, now"
29833,BOOK III.,Well with the worlds and every cow!
29834,BOOK III.,Let Ráma in the deadly fray
29835,BOOK III.,"The fiends who walk in darkness slay,"
29836,BOOK III.,As He who bears the discus(464) slew
29837,BOOK III.,"The chieftains of the Asur crew."""
29838,BOOK III.,
29839,BOOK III.,Then each with anxious glances viewed
29840,BOOK III.,His fellow and his speech renewed:
29841,BOOK III.,"""There twice seven thousand giants stand"
29842,BOOK III.,With impious heart and cruel hand:
29843,BOOK III.,"Here Ráma stands, by virtue known:"
29844,BOOK III.,"How can the hero fight alone?"""
29845,BOOK III.,
29846,BOOK III.,"Thus royal sage and Bráhman saint,"
29847,BOOK III.,"Spirit, and Virtue free from taint,"
29848,BOOK III.,And all the Gods of heaven who rode
29849,BOOK III.,"On golden cars, their longing showed."
29850,BOOK III.,"Their hearts with doubt and terror rent,"
29851,BOOK III.,"They saw the giants' armament,"
29852,BOOK III.,"And Ráma clothed in warrior might,"
29853,BOOK III.,Forth standing in the front of fight.
29854,BOOK III.,"Lord of the arm no toil might tire,"
29855,BOOK III.,"He stood majestic in his ire,"
29856,BOOK III.,Matchless in form as Rudra(465) when
29857,BOOK III.,His wrath is fierce on Gods or men.
29858,BOOK III.,
29859,BOOK III.,While Gods and saints in close array
29860,BOOK III.,"Held converse of the coming fray,"
29861,BOOK III.,The army of the fiends drew near
29862,BOOK III.,With sight and sound that counselled fear.
29863,BOOK III.,"Long, loud and deep their war-cry pealed,"
29864,BOOK III.,"As on they rushed with flag and shield,"
29865,BOOK III.,"Each, of his proper valour proud,"
29866,BOOK III.,Urging to fight the demon crowd.
29867,BOOK III.,"His ponderous bow each warrior tried,"
29868,BOOK III.,And swelled his bulk with martial pride.
29869,BOOK III.,"'Mid shout and roar and trampling feet,"
29870,BOOK III.,"And thunder of the drums they beat,"
29871,BOOK III.,Loud and more loud the tumult went
29872,BOOK III.,"Throughout the forest's vast extent,"
29873,BOOK III.,And all the life that moved within
29874,BOOK III.,The woodland trembled at the din.
29875,BOOK III.,In eager haste all fled to find
29876,BOOK III.,"Some tranquil spot, nor looked behind."
29877,BOOK III.,
29878,BOOK III.,"With every arm of war supplied,"
29879,BOOK III.,On-rushing wildly like the tide
29880,BOOK III.,"Of some deep sea, the giant host"
29881,BOOK III.,Approached where Ráma kept his post.
29882,BOOK III.,"Then he, in battle skilled and tried,"
29883,BOOK III.,"Bent his keen eye on every side,"
29884,BOOK III.,And viewed the host of Khara face
29885,BOOK III.,To face before his dwelling-place.
29886,BOOK III.,"He drew his arrows forth, and reared"
29887,BOOK III.,"And strained that bow which foemen feared,"
29888,BOOK III.,And yielded to the vengeful sway
29889,BOOK III.,Of fierce desire that host to slay.
29890,BOOK III.,Terrific as the ruinous fire
29891,BOOK III.,"That ends the worlds, he glowed in ire,"
29892,BOOK III.,And his tremendous form dismayed
29893,BOOK III.,The Gods who roam the forest shade.
29894,BOOK III.,For in the furious wrath that glowed
29895,BOOK III.,Within his soul the hero showed
29896,BOOK III.,Like Siva when his angry might
29897,BOOK III.,Stayed Daksha's sacrificial rite.(466)
29898,BOOK III.,Like some great cloud at dawn of day
29899,BOOK III.,"When first the sun upsprings,"
29900,BOOK III.,And o'er the gloomy mass each ray
29901,BOOK III.,A golden radiance flings:
29902,BOOK III.,"Thus showed the children of the night,"
29903,BOOK III.,"Whose mail and chariots threw,"
29904,BOOK III.,"With gleam of bows and armlets bright,"
29905,BOOK III.,Flashes of flamy hue.

29911,BOOK III.,
29912,BOOK III.,
29913,BOOK III.,When Khara with the hosts he led
29914,BOOK III.,"Drew near to Ráma's leafy shed,"
29915,BOOK III.,He saw that queller of the foe
29916,BOOK III.,Stand ready with his ordered bow.
29917,BOOK III.,"He saw, and burning at the view"
29918,BOOK III.,"His clanging bow he raised and drew,"
29919,BOOK III.,And bade his driver urge apace
29920,BOOK III.,His car to meet him face to face.
29921,BOOK III.,Obedient to his master's hest
29922,BOOK III.,His eager steeds the driver pressed
29923,BOOK III.,"On to the spot where, none to aid,"
29924,BOOK III.,The strong-armed chief his weapon swayed.
29925,BOOK III.,Soon as the children of the night
29926,BOOK III.,"Saw Khara rushing to the fight,"
29927,BOOK III.,His lords with loud unearthly cry
29928,BOOK III.,Followed their chief and gathered nigh.
29929,BOOK III.,As in his car the leader rode
29930,BOOK III.,"With all his lords around, he showed"
29931,BOOK III.,Like the red planet fiery Mars
29932,BOOK III.,Surrounded by the lesser stars.
29933,BOOK III.,Then with a horrid yell that rent
29934,BOOK III.,"The air, the giant chieftain sent"
29935,BOOK III.,A thousand darts in rapid shower
29936,BOOK III.,On Ráma matchless in his power.
29937,BOOK III.,"The rovers of the night, impelled"
29938,BOOK III.,"By fiery rage which naught withheld,"
29939,BOOK III.,"Upon the unconquered prince, who strained"
29940,BOOK III.,"His fearful bow, their arrows rained."
29941,BOOK III.,"With sword and club, with mace and pike,"
29942,BOOK III.,"With spear and axe to pierce and strike,"
29943,BOOK III.,Those furious fiends on every side
29944,BOOK III.,The unconquerable hero plied.
29945,BOOK III.,"The giant legions huge and strong,"
29946,BOOK III.,"Like clouds the tempest drives along,"
29947,BOOK III.,Rushed upon Ráma with the speed
29948,BOOK III.,"Of whirling car, and mounted steed,"
29949,BOOK III.,"And hill-like elephant, to slay"
29950,BOOK III.,The matchless prince in battle fray.
29951,BOOK III.,Then upon Ráma thick and fast
29952,BOOK III.,"The rain of mortal steel they cast,"
29953,BOOK III.,As labouring clouds their torrents shed
29954,BOOK III.,Upon the mountain-monarch's(467) head.
29955,BOOK III.,As near and nearer round him drew
29956,BOOK III.,"The warriors of the giant crew,"
29957,BOOK III.,He showed like Siva girt by all
29958,BOOK III.,His spirits when night's shadows fall.
29959,BOOK III.,As the great deep receives each rill
29960,BOOK III.,"And river rushing from the hill,"
29961,BOOK III.,"He bore that flood of darts, and broke"
29962,BOOK III.,With well-aimed shaft each murderous stroke.
29963,BOOK III.,"By stress of arrowy storm assailed,"
29964,BOOK III.,"And wounded sore, he never failed,"
29965,BOOK III.,Like some high mountain which defies
29966,BOOK III.,The red bolts flashing from the skies.
29967,BOOK III.,With ruddy streams each limb was dyed
29968,BOOK III.,"From gaping wounds in breast and side,"
29969,BOOK III.,Showing the hero like the sun
29970,BOOK III.,'Mid crimson clouds ere day is done.
29971,BOOK III.,"Then, at that sight of terror, faint"
29972,BOOK III.,"Grew God, Gandharva, sage, and saint,"
29973,BOOK III.,Trembling to see the prince oppose
29974,BOOK III.,His single might to myriad foes.
29975,BOOK III.,"But waxing wroth, with force unspent,"
29976,BOOK III.,"He strained his bow to utmost bent,"
29977,BOOK III.,And forth his arrows keen and true
29978,BOOK III.,"In hundreds, yea in thousands flew,--"
29979,BOOK III.,"Shafts none could ward, and none endure:"
29980,BOOK III.,Death's fatal noose was scarce so sure.
29981,BOOK III.,As 'twere in playful ease he shot
29982,BOOK III.,"His gilded shafts, and rested not."
29983,BOOK III.,With swiftest flight and truest aim
29984,BOOK III.,Upon the giant hosts they came.
29985,BOOK III.,"Each smote, each stayed a foeman's breath"
29986,BOOK III.,As fatal as the coil of Death.
29987,BOOK III.,Each arrow through a giant tore
29988,BOOK III.,"A passage, and besmeared with gore,"
29989,BOOK III.,Pursued its onward way and through
29990,BOOK III.,The air with flamy brilliance flew.
29991,BOOK III.,Unnumbered were the arrows sent
29992,BOOK III.,"From the great bow which Ráma bent,"
29993,BOOK III.,And every shaft with iron head
29994,BOOK III.,The lifeblood of a giant shed.
29995,BOOK III.,"Their pennoned bows were cleft, nor mail"
29996,BOOK III.,Nor shield of hide could aught avail.
29997,BOOK III.,For Ráma's myriad arrows tore
29998,BOOK III.,"Through arms, and bracelets which they wore,"
29999,BOOK III.,And severed mighty warriors' thighs
30000,BOOK III.,"Like trunks of elephants in size,"
30001,BOOK III.,And cut resistless passage sheer
30002,BOOK III.,"Through gold-decked horse and charioteer,"
30003,BOOK III.,"Slew elephant and rider, slew"
30004,BOOK III.,"The horseman and the charger too,"
30005,BOOK III.,And infantry unnumbered sent
30006,BOOK III.,To dwell 'neath Yáma's government.
30007,BOOK III.,Then rose on high a fearful yell
30008,BOOK III.,"Of rovers of the night, who fell"
30009,BOOK III.,"Beneath that iron torrent, sore"
30010,BOOK III.,Wounded by shafts that rent and tore.
30011,BOOK III.,So mangled by the ceaseless storm
30012,BOOK III.,"Of shafts of every kind and form,"
30013,BOOK III.,"Such joy they found, as forests feel"
30014,BOOK III.,"When scorched by flame, from Ráma's steel."
30015,BOOK III.,"The mightiest still the fight maintained,"
30016,BOOK III.,And furious upon Ráma rained
30017,BOOK III.,"Dart, arrow, spear, with wild attacks"
30018,BOOK III.,"Of mace, and club, and battle-axe."
30019,BOOK III.,"But the great chief, unconquered yet,"
30020,BOOK III.,"Their weapons with his arrows met,"
30021,BOOK III.,"Which severed many a giant's head,"
30022,BOOK III.,And all the plain with corpses spread.
30023,BOOK III.,With sundered bow and shattered shield
30024,BOOK III.,"Headless they sank upon the field,"
30025,BOOK III.,"As the tall trees, that felt the blast"
30026,BOOK III.,"Of Garud's wing, to earth were cast."
30027,BOOK III.,The giants left unslaughtered there
30028,BOOK III.,"Where filled with terror and despair,"
30029,BOOK III.,And to their leader Khara fled
30030,BOOK III.,"Faint, wounded, and discomfited."
30031,BOOK III.,"These fiery Dúshan strove to cheer,"
30032,BOOK III.,And poised his bow to calm their fear;
30033,BOOK III.,"Then fierce as He who rules the dead,"
30034,BOOK III.,"When wroth, on angered Ráma sped."
30035,BOOK III.,"By Dúshan cheered, the demons cast"
30036,BOOK III.,Their dread aside and rallied fast
30037,BOOK III.,"With Sáls, rocks, palm-trees in their hands"
30038,BOOK III.,"With nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,"
30039,BOOK III.,Again upon the godlike man
30040,BOOK III.,"The mighty fiends infuriate ran,"
30041,BOOK III.,"These casting rocks like hail, and these"
30042,BOOK III.,A whelming shower of leafy trees.
30043,BOOK III.,"Wild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,"
30044,BOOK III.,"And raise on end each shuddering hair,"
30045,BOOK III.,As with the fiends who loved to rove
30046,BOOK III.,By night heroic Ráma strove!
30047,BOOK III.,The giants in their fury plied
30048,BOOK III.,Ráma with darts on every side.
30049,BOOK III.,"Then, by the gathering demons pressed"
30050,BOOK III.,"From north and south and east and west,"
30051,BOOK III.,By showers of deadly darts assailed
30052,BOOK III.,"From every quarter fiercely hailed,"
30053,BOOK III.,"Girt by the foes who swarmed around,"
30054,BOOK III.,He raised a mighty shout whose sound
30055,BOOK III.,Struck terror. On the giant crew
30056,BOOK III.,His great Gandharva(468) arrow flew.
30057,BOOK III.,A thousand mortal shafts were rained
30058,BOOK III.,"From the orbed bow the hero strained,"
30059,BOOK III.,Till east and west and south and north
30060,BOOK III.,Were filled with arrows volleyed forth.
30061,BOOK III.,They heard the fearful shout: they saw
30062,BOOK III.,"His mighty hand the bowstring draw,"
30063,BOOK III.,Yet could no wounded giant's eye
30064,BOOK III.,See the swift storm of arrows fly.
30065,BOOK III.,Still firm the warrior stood and cast
30066,BOOK III.,His deadly missiles thick and fast.
30067,BOOK III.,Dark grew the air with arrowy hail
30068,BOOK III.,Which hid the sun as with a veil.
30069,BOOK III.,"Fiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,"
30070,BOOK III.,"All in a moment, spread the plain,"
30071,BOOK III.,And thousands scarce alive were left
30072,BOOK III.,"Mangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft."
30073,BOOK III.,"Dire was the sight, the plain o'erspread"
30074,BOOK III.,With trophies of the mangled dead.
30075,BOOK III.,"There lay, by Ráma's missiles rent,"
30076,BOOK III.,"Full many a priceless ornament,"
30077,BOOK III.,"With severed limb and broken gem,"
30078,BOOK III.,Hauberk and helm and diadem.
30079,BOOK III.,"There lay the shattered car, the steed,"
30080,BOOK III.,"The elephant of noblest breed,"
30081,BOOK III.,"The splintered spear, the shivered mace,"
30082,BOOK III.,Chouris and screens to shade the face.
30083,BOOK III.,The giants saw with bitterest pain
30084,BOOK III.,"Their warriors weltering on the plain,"
30085,BOOK III.,Nor dared again his might oppose
30086,BOOK III.,Who scourged the cities of his foes.
30087,BOOK III.,
30088,BOOK III.,
30089,BOOK III.,
30090,BOOK III.,
30091,BOOK III.,Canto XXVI. Dúshan's Death.
30092,BOOK III.,
30093,BOOK III.,
30094,BOOK III.,When Dúshan saw his giant band
30095,BOOK III.,"Slaughtered by Ráma's conquering hand,"
30096,BOOK III.,"He called five thousand fiends, and gave"
30097,BOOK III.,"His orders. Bravest of the brave,"
30098,BOOK III.,"Invincible, of furious might,"
30099,BOOK III.,Ne'er had they turned their backs in flight.
30100,BOOK III.,"They, as their leader bade them seize"
30101,BOOK III.,"Spears, swords, and clubs, and rocks, and trees,"
30102,BOOK III.,Poured on the dauntless prince again
30103,BOOK III.,A ceaseless shower of deadly rain.
30104,BOOK III.,"The virtuous Ráma, undismayed,"
30105,BOOK III.,"Their missiles with his arrows stayed,"
30106,BOOK III.,"And weakened, ere it fell, the shock"
30107,BOOK III.,"Of that dire hail of tree and rock,"
30108,BOOK III.,"And like a bull with eyelids closed,"
30109,BOOK III.,The pelting of the storm opposed.
30110,BOOK III.,
30111,BOOK III.,Then blazed his ire: he longed to smite
30112,BOOK III.,To earth the rovers of the night.
30113,BOOK III.,The wrath that o'er his spirit came
30114,BOOK III.,"Clothed him with splendour as of flame,"
30115,BOOK III.,While showers of mortal darts he poured
30116,BOOK III.,Fierce on the giants and their lord.
30117,BOOK III.,"Dúshan, the foeman's dusky dread,"
30118,BOOK III.,"By frenzied rage inspirited,"
30119,BOOK III.,On Raghu's son his missiles cast
30120,BOOK III.,Like Indra's bolts which rend and blast.
30121,BOOK III.,But Ráma with a trenchant dart
30122,BOOK III.,Cleft Dúshan's ponderous bow apart.
30123,BOOK III.,And then the gold-decked steeds who drew
30124,BOOK III.,"The chariot, with four shafts he slew."
30125,BOOK III.,One crescent dart he aimed which shred
30126,BOOK III.,Clean from his neck the driver's head;
30127,BOOK III.,Three more with deadly skill addressed
30128,BOOK III.,Stood quivering in the giant's breast.
30129,BOOK III.,"Hurled from his car, steeds, driver slain,"
30130,BOOK III.,"The bow he trusted cleft in twain,"
30131,BOOK III.,"He seized his mace, strong, heavy, dread,"
30132,BOOK III.,High as a mountain's towering head.
30133,BOOK III.,"With plates of gold adorned and bound,"
30134,BOOK III.,Embattled Gods it crushed and ground.
30135,BOOK III.,Its iron spikes yet bore the stains
30136,BOOK III.,Of mangled foemen's blood and brains.
30137,BOOK III.,Its heavy mass of jagged steel
30138,BOOK III.,Was like a thunderbolt to feel.
30139,BOOK III.,"It shattered, as on foes it fell,"
30140,BOOK III.,The city where the senses dwell.(469)
30141,BOOK III.,Fierce Dúshan seized that ponderous mace
30142,BOOK III.,"Like monstrous form of serpent race,"
30143,BOOK III.,And all his savage soul aglow
30144,BOOK III.,"With fury, rushed upon the foe."
30145,BOOK III.,"But Raghu's son took steady aim,"
30146,BOOK III.,"And as the rushing giant came,"
30147,BOOK III.,Shore with two shafts the arms whereon
30148,BOOK III.,The demon's glittering bracelets shone.
30149,BOOK III.,"His arm at each huge shoulder lopped,"
30150,BOOK III.,"The mighty body reeled and dropped,"
30151,BOOK III.,And the great mace to earth was thrown
30152,BOOK III.,Like Indra's staff when storms have blown.
30153,BOOK III.,As some vast elephant who lies
30154,BOOK III.,"Shorn of his tusks, and bleeding dies,"
30155,BOOK III.,"So, when his arms were rent away,"
30156,BOOK III.,Low on the ground the giant lay.
30157,BOOK III.,"The spirits saw the monster die,"
30158,BOOK III.,"And loudly rang their joyful cry,"
30159,BOOK III.,"""Honour to Ráma! nobly done!"
30160,BOOK III.,"Well hast thou fought, Kakutstha's son!"""
30161,BOOK III.,"But the great three, the host who led,"
30162,BOOK III.,"Enraged to see their chieftain dead,"
30163,BOOK III.,"As though Death's toils were round them cast,"
30164,BOOK III.,"Rushed upon Ráma fierce and fast,"
30165,BOOK III.,"Mahákapála seized, to strike"
30166,BOOK III.,"His foeman down, a ponderous pike:"
30167,BOOK III.,"Sthúláksha charged with spear to fling,"
30168,BOOK III.,Pramáthi with his axe to swing.
30169,BOOK III.,"When Ráma saw, with keen darts he"
30170,BOOK III.,"Received the onset of the three,"
30171,BOOK III.,As calm as though he hailed a guest
30172,BOOK III.,"In each, who came for shade and rest."
30173,BOOK III.,Mahákapála's monstrous head
30174,BOOK III.,Fell with the trenchant dart he sped.
30175,BOOK III.,His good right hand in battle skilled
30176,BOOK III.,"Sthúláksha's eyes with arrows filled,"
30177,BOOK III.,And trusting still his ready bow
30178,BOOK III.,"He laid the fierce Pramáthi low,"
30179,BOOK III.,Who sank as some tall tree falls down
30180,BOOK III.,With bough and branch and leafy crown.
30181,BOOK III.,Then with five thousand shafts he slew
30182,BOOK III.,The rest of Dúshan's giant crew:
30183,BOOK III.,"Five thousand demons, torn and rent,"
30184,BOOK III.,To Yáma's gloomy realm he sent.
30185,BOOK III.,
30186,BOOK III.,When Khara knew the fate of all
30187,BOOK III.,"The giant band and Dúshan's fall,"
30188,BOOK III.,He called the mighty chiefs who led
30189,BOOK III.,"His army, and in fury said:"
30190,BOOK III.,
30191,BOOK III.,"""Now Dúshan and his armčd train"
30192,BOOK III.,Lie prostrate on the battle plain.
30193,BOOK III.,"Lead forth an army mightier still,"
30194,BOOK III.,"Ráma this wretched man, to kill."
30195,BOOK III.,"Fight ye with darts of every shape,"
30196,BOOK III.,"Nor let him from your wrath escape."""
30197,BOOK III.,
30198,BOOK III.,"Thus spoke the fiend, by rage impelled,"
30199,BOOK III.,And straight his course toward Ráma held.
30200,BOOK III.,With Syenagámí and the rest
30201,BOOK III.,"Of his twelve chiefs he onward pressed,"
30202,BOOK III.,And every giant as he went
30203,BOOK III.,A storm of well-wrought arrows sent.
30204,BOOK III.,Then with his pointed shafts that came
30205,BOOK III.,"With gold and diamond bright as flame,"
30206,BOOK III.,Dead to the earth the hero threw
30207,BOOK III.,The remnant of the demon crew.
30208,BOOK III.,"Those shafts with feathers bright as gold,"
30209,BOOK III.,"Like flames which wreaths of smoke enfold,"
30210,BOOK III.,Smote down the fiends like tall trees rent
30211,BOOK III.,By red bolts from the firmament.
30212,BOOK III.,A hundred shafts he pointed well:
30213,BOOK III.,By their keen barbs a hundred fell:
30214,BOOK III.,"A thousand,--and a thousand more"
30215,BOOK III.,In battle's front lay drenched in gore.
30216,BOOK III.,"Of all defence and guard bereft,"
30217,BOOK III.,With sundered bows and harness cleft.
30218,BOOK III.,Their bodies red with bloody stain
30219,BOOK III.,"Fell the night-rovers on the plain,"
30220,BOOK III.,"Which, covered with the loosened hair"
30221,BOOK III.,"Of bleeding giants prostrate there,"
30222,BOOK III.,"Like some great altar showed, arrayed"
30223,BOOK III.,For holy rites with grass o'erlaid.
30224,BOOK III.,"The darksome wood, each glade and dell"
30225,BOOK III.,Where the wild demons fought and fell
30226,BOOK III.,Was like an awful hell whose floor
30227,BOOK III.,Is thick with mire and flesh and gore.
30228,BOOK III.,
30229,BOOK III.,"Thus twice seven thousand fiends, a band"
30230,BOOK III.,"With impious heart and bloody hand,"
30231,BOOK III.,"By Raghu's son were overthrown,"
30232,BOOK III.,"A man, on foot, and all alone."
30233,BOOK III.,"Of all who met on that fierce day,"
30234,BOOK III.,"Khara, great chief, survived the fray,"
30235,BOOK III.,"The monster of the triple head,(470)"
30236,BOOK III.,"And Raghu's son, the foeman's dread."
30237,BOOK III.,"The other demon warriors, all"
30238,BOOK III.,"Skilful and brave and strong and tall,"
30239,BOOK III.,"In front of battle, side by side,"
30240,BOOK III.,Struck down by Lakshman's brother died.
30241,BOOK III.,When Khara saw the host he led
30242,BOOK III.,Triumphant forth to fight
30243,BOOK III.,"Stretched on the earth, all smitten dead,"
30244,BOOK III.,"By Ráma's nobler might,"
30245,BOOK III.,"Upon his foe he fiercely glared,"
30246,BOOK III.,"And drove against him fast,"
30247,BOOK III.,Like Indra when his arm is bared
30248,BOOK III.,His thundering bolt to cast.

30254,BOOK III.,
30255,BOOK III.,
30256,BOOK III.,"But Trisirás,(471) a chieftain dread,"
30257,BOOK III.,Marked Khara as he onward sped.
30258,BOOK III.,"And met his car and cried, to stay"
30259,BOOK III.,The giant from the purposed fray:
30260,BOOK III.,"""Mine be the charge: let me attack,"
30261,BOOK III.,And turn thee from the contest back.
30262,BOOK III.,"Let me go forth, and thou shalt see"
30263,BOOK III.,The strong-armed Ráma slain by me.
30264,BOOK III.,"True are the words I speak, my lord:"
30265,BOOK III.,I swear it as I touch my sword:
30266,BOOK III.,"That I this Ráma's blood will spill,"
30267,BOOK III.,Whom every giant's hand should kill.
30268,BOOK III.,"This Ráma will I slay, or he"
30269,BOOK III.,In battle fray shall conquer me.
30270,BOOK III.,"Restrain thy spirit: check thy car,"
30271,BOOK III.,And view the combat from afar.
30272,BOOK III.,"Thou, joying o'er the prostrate foe,"
30273,BOOK III.,"To Janasthán again shalt go,"
30274,BOOK III.,"Or, if I fall in battle's chance,"
30275,BOOK III.,"Against my conqueror advance."""
30276,BOOK III.,
30277,BOOK III.,Thus Trisirás for death who yearned:
30278,BOOK III.,"And Khara from the conflict turned,"
30279,BOOK III.,"""Go forth to battle,"" Khara cried;"
30280,BOOK III.,And toward his foe the giant hied.
30281,BOOK III.,Borne on a car of glittering hue
30282,BOOK III.,"Which harnessed coursers fleetly drew,"
30283,BOOK III.,Like some huge hill with triple peak
30284,BOOK III.,He onward rushed the prince to seek.
30285,BOOK III.,"Still, like a big cloud, sending out"
30286,BOOK III.,His arrowy rain with many a shout
30287,BOOK III.,Like the deep sullen roars that come
30288,BOOK III.,Discordant from a moistened drum.
30289,BOOK III.,"But Raghu's son, whose watchful eye"
30290,BOOK III.,"Beheld the demon rushing nigh,"
30291,BOOK III.,From the great bow he raised and bent
30292,BOOK III.,A shower of shafts to meet him sent.
30293,BOOK III.,Wild grew the fight and wilder yet
30294,BOOK III.,"As fiend and man in combat met,"
30295,BOOK III.,As when in some dark wood's retreat
30296,BOOK III.,An elephant and a lion meet.
30297,BOOK III.,
30298,BOOK III.,"The giant bent his bow, and true"
30299,BOOK III.,To Ráma's brow three arrows flew.
30300,BOOK III.,"Then, raging as he felt the stroke,"
30301,BOOK III.,These words in anger Ráma spoke:
30302,BOOK III.,"""Heroic chief! is such the power"
30303,BOOK III.,Of fiends who rove at midnight hour?
30304,BOOK III.,Soft as the touch of flowers I feel
30305,BOOK III.,The gentle blows thine arrows deal.
30306,BOOK III.,"Receive in turn my shafts, and know"
30307,BOOK III.,"What arrows fly from Ráma's bow."""
30308,BOOK III.,"Thus as he spoke his wrath grew hot,"
30309,BOOK III.,"And twice seven deadly shafts he shot,"
30310,BOOK III.,"Which, dire as serpent's deadly fang,"
30311,BOOK III.,Straight to the giant's bosom sprang.
30312,BOOK III.,"Four arrows more,--each shaped to deal"
30313,BOOK III.,"A mortal wound with barbčd steel,--"
30314,BOOK III.,"The glorious hero shot, and slew"
30315,BOOK III.,The four good steeds the car that drew.
30316,BOOK III.,"Eight other shafts flew straight and fleet,"
30317,BOOK III.,"And hurled the driver from his seat,"
30318,BOOK III.,And in the dust the banner laid
30319,BOOK III.,That proudly o'er the chariot played.
30320,BOOK III.,Then as the fiend prepared to bound
30321,BOOK III.,"Forth from his useless car to ground,"
30322,BOOK III.,"The hero smote him to the heart,"
30323,BOOK III.,And numbed his arm with deadly smart.
30324,BOOK III.,"Again the chieftain, peerless-souled,"
30325,BOOK III.,"Sent forth three rapid darts, and rolled"
30326,BOOK III.,"With each keen arrow, deftly sped,"
30327,BOOK III.,Low in the dust a monstrous head.
30328,BOOK III.,"Then yielding to each deadly stroke,"
30329,BOOK III.,"Forth spouting streams of blood and smoke,"
30330,BOOK III.,The headless trunk bedrenched with gore
30331,BOOK III.,Fell to the ground and moved no more.
30332,BOOK III.,"The fiends who yet were left with life,"
30333,BOOK III.,"Routed and crushed in battle strife,"
30334,BOOK III.,"To Khara's side, like trembling deer"
30335,BOOK III.,"Scared by the hunter, fled in fear."
30336,BOOK III.,King Khara saw with furious eye
30337,BOOK III.,His scattered giants turn and fly;
30338,BOOK III.,Then rallying his broken train
30339,BOOK III.,"At Raghu's son he drove amain,"
30340,BOOK III.,Like Ráhu(472) when his deadly might
30341,BOOK III.,Comes rushing on the Lord of Night.

30351,BOOK III.,Fear o'er the giant's spirit came
30352,BOOK III.,Of Ráma's might which naught could tame.
30353,BOOK III.,"He saw his savage legions, those"
30354,BOOK III.,"Whose force no creature dared oppose,--"
30355,BOOK III.,He saw the leader of his train
30356,BOOK III.,By Ráma's single prowess slain.
30357,BOOK III.,With burning grief he marked the few
30358,BOOK III.,Still left him of his giant crew.
30359,BOOK III.,"As Namuchi(473) on Indra, so"
30360,BOOK III.,Rushed the dread demon on his foe.

30362,BOOK III.,And angrily on Ráma rained
30363,BOOK III.,"His mortal arrows in a flood,"
30364,BOOK III.,Like serpent fangs athirst for blood.
30365,BOOK III.,"Skilled in the bowman's warlike art,"
30366,BOOK III.,He plied the string and poised the dart.
30367,BOOK III.,"Here, on his car, and there, he rode,"
30368,BOOK III.,"And passages of battle showed,"
30369,BOOK III.,While all the skyey regions grew
30370,BOOK III.,Dark with his arrows as they flew.
30371,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma seized his ponderous bow,"
30372,BOOK III.,And straight the heaven was all aglow
30373,BOOK III.,With shafts whose stroke no life might bear
30374,BOOK III.,"That filled with flash and flame the air,"
30375,BOOK III.,Thick as the blinding torrents sent
30376,BOOK III.,Down from Parjanya's(474) firmament.
30377,BOOK III.,"In space itself no space remained,"
30378,BOOK III.,But all was filled with arrows rained
30379,BOOK III.,Incessantly from each great bow
30380,BOOK III.,Wielded by Ráma and his foe.
30381,BOOK III.,"As thus in furious combat, wrought"
30382,BOOK III.,"To mortal hate, the warriors fought,"
30383,BOOK III.,"The sun himself grew faint and pale,"
30384,BOOK III.,Obscured behind that arrowy veil.
30385,BOOK III.,
30386,BOOK III.,As when beneath the driver's steel
30387,BOOK III.,"An elephant is forced to kneel,"
30388,BOOK III.,So from the hard and pointed head
30389,BOOK III.,Of many an arrow Ráma bled.
30390,BOOK III.,High on his car the giant rose
30391,BOOK III.,"Prepared in deadly strife to close,"
30392,BOOK III.,And all the spirits saw him stand
30393,BOOK III.,Like Yáma with his noose in hand.
30394,BOOK III.,For Khara deemed in senseless pride
30395,BOOK III.,"That he, beneath whose hand had died"
30396,BOOK III.,"The giant legions, failed at length"
30397,BOOK III.,Slow sinking with exhausted strength.
30398,BOOK III.,"But Ráma, like a lion, when"
30399,BOOK III.,"A trembling deer comes nigh his den,"
30400,BOOK III.,"Feared not the demon mad with hate,--"
30401,BOOK III.,Of lion might and lion gait.
30402,BOOK III.,Then in his lofty car that glowed
30403,BOOK III.,With sunlike brilliance Khara rode
30404,BOOK III.,At Ráma: madly on he came
30405,BOOK III.,Like a poor moth that seeks the flame.
30406,BOOK III.,"His archer skill the fiend displayed,"
30407,BOOK III.,And at the place where Ráma laid
30408,BOOK III.,"His hand, an arrow cleft in two"
30409,BOOK III.,The mighty bow the hero drew.
30410,BOOK III.,"Seven arrows by the giant sent,"
30411,BOOK III.,"Bright as the bolts of Indra, rent"
30412,BOOK III.,"Their way through mail and harness joints,"
30413,BOOK III.,And pierced him with their iron points.
30414,BOOK III.,"On Ráma, hero unsurpassed,"
30415,BOOK III.,"A thousand shafts smote thick and fast,"
30416,BOOK III.,"While as each missile struck, rang out"
30417,BOOK III.,The giant's awful battle-shout.
30418,BOOK III.,His knotted arrows pierced and tore
30419,BOOK III.,"The sunbright mail the hero wore,"
30420,BOOK III.,"Till, band and buckle rent away,"
30421,BOOK III.,Glittering on the ground it lay.
30422,BOOK III.,"Then pierced in shoulder, breast, and side,"
30423,BOOK III.,"Till every limb with blood was dyed,"
30424,BOOK III.,The chieftain in majestic ire
30425,BOOK III.,Shone glorious as the smokeless fire.
30426,BOOK III.,Then loud and long the war-cry rose
30427,BOOK III.,"Of Ráma, terror of his foes,"
30428,BOOK III.,"As, on the giant's death intent,"
30429,BOOK III.,"A ponderous bow he strung and bent,--"
30430,BOOK III.,"Lord Vishnu's own, of wondrous size,--"
30431,BOOK III.,Agastya gave the heavenly prize.
30432,BOOK III.,"Then rushing on the demon foe,"
30433,BOOK III.,"He raised on high that mighty bow,"
30434,BOOK III.,"And with his well-wrought shafts, whereon"
30435,BOOK III.,"Bright gold between the feathers shone,"
30436,BOOK III.,He struck the pennon fluttering o'er
30437,BOOK III.,"The chariot, and it waved no more."
30438,BOOK III.,That glorious flag whose every fold
30439,BOOK III.,"Was rich with blazonry and gold,"
30440,BOOK III.,Fell as the sun himself by all
30441,BOOK III.,The Gods' decree might earthward fall.
30442,BOOK III.,"From wrathful Khara's hand, whose art"
30443,BOOK III.,"Well knew each vulnerable part,"
30444,BOOK III.,"Four keenly-piercing arrows flew,"
30445,BOOK III.,"And blood in Ráma's bosom drew,"
30446,BOOK III.,With every limb distained with gore
30447,BOOK III.,"From deadly shafts which rent and tore,"
30448,BOOK III.,"From Khara's clanging bowstring shots,"
30449,BOOK III.,The prince's wrath waxed wondrous hot.
30450,BOOK III.,His hand upon his bow that best
30451,BOOK III.,"Of mighty archers firmly pressed,"
30452,BOOK III.,"And from the well-drawn bowstring, true"
30453,BOOK III.,"Each to its mark, six arrows flew."
30454,BOOK III.,"One quivered in the giant's head,"
30455,BOOK III.,With two his brawny shoulders bled;
30456,BOOK III.,"Three, with the crescent heads they bore,"
30457,BOOK III.,Deep in his breast a passage tore.
30458,BOOK III.,"Thirteen, to which the stone had lent"
30459,BOOK III.,"The keenest point, were swiftly sent"
30460,BOOK III.,"On the fierce giant, every one"
30461,BOOK III.,"Destructive, gleaming like the sun."
30462,BOOK III.,With four the dappled steeds he slew;
30463,BOOK III.,"One cleft the chariot yoke in two,"
30464,BOOK III.,"One, in the heat of battle sped,"
30465,BOOK III.,Smote from the neck the driver's head.
30466,BOOK III.,The poles were rent apart by three;
30467,BOOK III.,Two broke the splintered axle-tree.
30468,BOOK III.,"Then from the hand of Ráma, while"
30469,BOOK III.,"Across his lips there came a smile,"
30470,BOOK III.,"The twelfth, like thunderbolt impelled,"
30471,BOOK III.,Cut the great hand and bow it held.
30472,BOOK III.,"Then, scarce by Indra's self surpassed,"
30473,BOOK III.,He pierced the giant with the last.
30474,BOOK III.,"The bow he trusted cleft in twain,"
30475,BOOK III.,"His driver and his horses slain,"
30476,BOOK III.,"Down sprang the giant, mace in hand,"
30477,BOOK III.,On foot against the foe to stand.
30478,BOOK III.,The Gods and saints in bright array
30479,BOOK III.,"Close gathered in the skies,"
30480,BOOK III.,The prince's might in battle-fray
30481,BOOK III.,Beheld with joyful eyes.
30482,BOOK III.,"Uprising from their golden seats,"
30483,BOOK III.,"Their hands in honour raised,"
30484,BOOK III.,"They looked on Ráma's noble feats,"
30485,BOOK III.,And blessed him as they praised.

30493,BOOK III.,"When Ráma saw the giant nigh,"
30494,BOOK III.,"On foot, alone, with mace reared high,"
30495,BOOK III.,"In mild reproof at first he spoke,"
30496,BOOK III.,Then forth his threatening anger broke:
30497,BOOK III.,"""Thou with the host 'twas thine to lead,"
30498,BOOK III.,"With elephant and car and steed,"
30499,BOOK III.,"Hast wrought an act of sin and shame,"
30500,BOOK III.,An act which all who live must blame.
30501,BOOK III.,Know that the wretch whose evil mind
30502,BOOK III.,"Joys in the grief of human kind,"
30503,BOOK III.,"Though the three worlds confess him lord,"
30504,BOOK III.,Must perish dreaded and abhorred.
30505,BOOK III.,"Night-rover, when a villain's deeds"
30506,BOOK III.,"Distress the world he little heeds,"
30507,BOOK III.,"Each hand is armed his life to take,"
30508,BOOK III.,And crush him like a deadly snake.
30509,BOOK III.,The end is near when men begin
30510,BOOK III.,"Through greed or lust a life of sin,"
30511,BOOK III.,"E'en as a Bráhman's dame, unwise,"
30512,BOOK III.,Eats of the fallen hail(475) and dies.
30513,BOOK III.,"Thy hand has slain the pure and good,"
30514,BOOK III.,"The hermit saints of Dandak wood,"
30515,BOOK III.,"Of holy life, the heirs of bliss;"
30516,BOOK III.,And thou shalt reap the fruit of this.
30517,BOOK III.,Not long shall they whose cruel breasts
30518,BOOK III.,Joy in the sin the world detests
30519,BOOK III.,"Retain their guilty power and pride,"
30520,BOOK III.,But fade like trees whose roots are dried.
30521,BOOK III.,"Yes, as the seasons come and go,"
30522,BOOK III.,"Each tree its kindly fruit must show,"
30523,BOOK III.,And sinners reap in fitting time
30524,BOOK III.,The harvest of each earlier crime.
30525,BOOK III.,As those must surely die who eat
30526,BOOK III.,"Unwittingly of poisoned meat,"
30527,BOOK III.,They too whose lives in sin are spent
30528,BOOK III.,Receive ere long the punishment.
30529,BOOK III.,"And know, thou rover of the night,"
30530,BOOK III.,"That I, a king, am sent to smite"
30531,BOOK III.,"The wicked down, who court the hate"
30532,BOOK III.,Of men whose laws they violate.
30533,BOOK III.,This day my vengeful hand shall send
30534,BOOK III.,"Shafts bright with gold to tear and rend,"
30535,BOOK III.,And pass with fury through thy breast
30536,BOOK III.,As serpents pierce an emmet's nest.
30537,BOOK III.,Thou with thy host this day shalt be
30538,BOOK III.,"Among the dead below, and see"
30539,BOOK III.,"The saints beneath thy hand who bled,"
30540,BOOK III.,Whose flesh thy cruel maw has fed.
30541,BOOK III.,"They, glorious on their seats of gold,"
30542,BOOK III.,Their slayer shall in hell behold.
30543,BOOK III.,"Fight with all strength thou callest thine,"
30544,BOOK III.,"Mean scion of ignoble line,"
30545,BOOK III.,"Still, like the palm-tree's fruit, this day"
30546,BOOK III.,"My shafts thy head in dust shall lay."""
30547,BOOK III.,
30548,BOOK III.,Such were the words that Ráma said:
30549,BOOK III.,"Then Khara's eyes with wrath glowed red,"
30550,BOOK III.,"Who, maddened by the rage that burned"
30551,BOOK III.,"Within him, with a smile returned:"
30552,BOOK III.,
30553,BOOK III.,"""Thou Dasaratha's son, hast slain"
30554,BOOK III.,The meaner giants of my train:
30555,BOOK III.,And canst thou idly vaunt thy might
30556,BOOK III.,And claim the praise not thine by right?
30557,BOOK III.,Not thus in self-laudation rave
30558,BOOK III.,"The truly great, the nobly brave:"
30559,BOOK III.,No empty boasts like thine disgrace
30560,BOOK III.,The foremost of the human race.
30561,BOOK III.,"The mean of soul, unknown to fame,"
30562,BOOK III.,"Who taint their warrior race with shame,"
30563,BOOK III.,"Thus speak in senseless pride as thou,"
30564,BOOK III.,"O Raghu's son, hast boasted now."
30565,BOOK III.,"What hero, when the war-cry rings,"
30566,BOOK III.,"Vaunts the high race from which he springs,"
30567,BOOK III.,"Or seeks, when warriors meet and die,"
30568,BOOK III.,His own descent to glorify?
30569,BOOK III.,Weakness and folly show confessed
30570,BOOK III.,"In every vaunt thou utterest,"
30571,BOOK III.,As when the flames fed high with grass
30572,BOOK III.,Detect the simulating brass.
30573,BOOK III.,Dost thou not see me standing here
30574,BOOK III.,"Armed with the mighty mace I rear,"
30575,BOOK III.,Firm as an earth upholding hill
30576,BOOK III.,Whose summit veins of metal fill?
30577,BOOK III.,"Lo, here I stand before thy face"
30578,BOOK III.,"To slay thee with my murderous mace,"
30579,BOOK III.,"As Death, the universal lord,"
30580,BOOK III.,Stands threatening with his fatal cord.
30581,BOOK III.,Enough of this. Much more remains
30582,BOOK III.,That should be said: but time constrains.
30583,BOOK III.,"Ere to his rest the sun descend,"
30584,BOOK III.,"And shades of night the combat end,"
30585,BOOK III.,The twice seven thousand of my band
30586,BOOK III.,Who fell beneath thy bloody hand
30587,BOOK III.,Shall have their tears all wiped away
30588,BOOK III.,"And triumph in thy fall to-day."""
30589,BOOK III.,
30590,BOOK III.,"He spoke, and loosing from his hold"
30591,BOOK III.,"His mighty mace ringed round with gold,"
30592,BOOK III.,Like some red bolt alive with fire
30593,BOOK III.,"Hurled it at Ráma, mad with ire."
30594,BOOK III.,The ponderous mace which Khara threw
30595,BOOK III.,Sent fiery flashes as it flew.
30596,BOOK III.,"Trees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,"
30597,BOOK III.,As onward to its aim it passed.
30598,BOOK III.,"But Ráma, watching as it sped"
30599,BOOK III.,"Dire as His noose who rules the dead,"
30600,BOOK III.,Cleft it with arrows as it came
30601,BOOK III.,On rushing with a hiss and flame.
30602,BOOK III.,"Its fury spent and burnt away,"
30603,BOOK III.,Harmless upon the ground it lay

30616,BOOK III.,Of chiefs the furious fiend addressed:
30617,BOOK III.,
30618,BOOK III.,"""Thou, worst of giant blood, at length"
30619,BOOK III.,"Hast shown the utmost of thy strength,"
30620,BOOK III.,"And forced by greater might to bow,"
30621,BOOK III.,Thy vaunting threats are idle now.
30622,BOOK III.,My shafts have cut thy club in twain:
30623,BOOK III.,"Useless it lies upon the plain,"
30624,BOOK III.,And all thy pride and haughty trust
30625,BOOK III.,Lie with it levelled in the dust.
30626,BOOK III.,"The words that thou hast said to-day,"
30627,BOOK III.,That thou wouldst wipe the tears away
30628,BOOK III.,"Of all the giants I have slain,"
30629,BOOK III.,My deeds shall render void and vain.
30630,BOOK III.,"Thou meanest of the giants' breed,"
30631,BOOK III.,"Evil in thought and word and deed,"
30632,BOOK III.,My hand shall take that life of thine
30633,BOOK III.,As Garud(476) seized the juice divine.
30634,BOOK III.,"Thou, rent by shafts, this day shalt die:"
30635,BOOK III.,"Low on the ground thy corse shall lie,"
30636,BOOK III.,And bubbles from the cloven neck
30637,BOOK III.,With froth and blood thy skin shall deck.
30638,BOOK III.,"With dust and mire all rudely dyed,"
30639,BOOK III.,"Thy torn arms lying by thy side,"

30642,BOOK III.,Like a fond lover when he strains
30643,BOOK III.,The beauty whom at length he gains.
30644,BOOK III.,Now when thy heavy eyelids close
30645,BOOK III.,"For ever in thy deep repose,"
30646,BOOK III.,Again shall Dandak forest be
30647,BOOK III.,Safe refuge for the devotee.
30648,BOOK III.,"Thou slain, and all thy race who held"
30649,BOOK III.,"The realm of Janasthán expelled,"
30650,BOOK III.,"Again shall happy hermits rove,"
30651,BOOK III.,"Fearing no danger, through the grove."
30652,BOOK III.,"Within those bounds, their brethren slain,"
30653,BOOK III.,"No giant shall this day remain,"
30654,BOOK III.,But all shall fly with many a tear
30655,BOOK III.,"And fearing, rid the saints of fear."

30661,BOOK III.,"Plaguer of Bráhmans and mankind,"
30662,BOOK III.,With trembling hands each devotee
30663,BOOK III.,"Feeds holy fires in dread of thee."""
30664,BOOK III.,
30665,BOOK III.,Thus with wild fury unrepressed
30666,BOOK III.,Raghu's brave son the fiend addressed;
30667,BOOK III.,"And Khara, as his wrath grew high,"
30668,BOOK III.,Thus thundered forth his fierce reply:
30669,BOOK III.,
30670,BOOK III.,"""By senseless pride to madness wrought,"
30671,BOOK III.,"By danger girt thou fearest naught,"
30672,BOOK III.,"Nor heedest, numbered with the dead,"
30673,BOOK III.,What thou shouldst say and leave unsaid.
30674,BOOK III.,When Fate's tremendous coils enfold
30675,BOOK III.,"The captive in resistless hold,"
30676,BOOK III.,"He knows not right from wrong, each sense"
30677,BOOK III.,"Numbed by that deadly influence."""
30678,BOOK III.,
30679,BOOK III.,"He spoke, and when his speech was done"
30680,BOOK III.,Bent his fierce brows on Raghu's son.
30681,BOOK III.,With eager eyes he looked around
30682,BOOK III.,If lethal arms might yet be found.
30683,BOOK III.,Not far away and full in view
30684,BOOK III.,A Sál-tree towering upward grew.
30685,BOOK III.,"His lips in mighty strain compressed,"
30686,BOOK III.,"He tore it up with root and crest,"
30687,BOOK III.,With huge arms waved it o'er his head
30688,BOOK III.,"And hurled it shouting, Thou art dead."
30689,BOOK III.,"But Ráma, unsurpassed in might,"
30690,BOOK III.,"Stayed with his shafts its onward flight,"
30691,BOOK III.,And furious longing seized his soul
30692,BOOK III.,The giant in the dust to roll.
30693,BOOK III.,"Great drops of sweat each limb bedewed,"
30694,BOOK III.,His red eyes showed his wrathful mood.
30695,BOOK III.,"A thousand arrows, swiftly sent,"
30696,BOOK III.,The giant's bosom tore and rent.
30697,BOOK III.,From every gash his body showed
30698,BOOK III.,"The blood in foamy torrents flowed,"
30699,BOOK III.,As springing from their caverns leap
30700,BOOK III.,Swift rivers down the mountain steep.
30701,BOOK III.,When Khara felt each deadened power
30702,BOOK III.,"Yielding beneath that murderous shower,"
30703,BOOK III.,"He charged, infuriate with the scent"
30704,BOOK III.,"Of blood, in dire bewilderment."
30705,BOOK III.,"But Ráma watched, with ready bow,"
30706,BOOK III.,"The onset of his bleeding foe,"
30707,BOOK III.,"And ere the monster reached him, drew"
30708,BOOK III.,Backward in haste a yard or two.
30709,BOOK III.,Then from his side a shaft he took
30710,BOOK III.,Whose mortal stroke no life might brook:
30711,BOOK III.,"Of peerless might, it bore the name"
30712,BOOK III.,"Of Brahmá's staff, and glowed with flame:"
30713,BOOK III.,"Lord Indra, ruler of the skies,"
30714,BOOK III.,Himself had given the glorious prize.
30715,BOOK III.,"His bow the virtuous hero drew,"
30716,BOOK III.,And at the fiend the arrow flew.
30717,BOOK III.,Hissing and roaring like the blast
30718,BOOK III.,"Of tempest through the air it passed,"
30719,BOOK III.,"And fixed, by Ráma's vigour sped,"
30720,BOOK III.,In the foe's breast its pointed head.
30721,BOOK III.,Then fell the fiend: the quenchless flame
30722,BOOK III.,Burnt furious in his wounded frame.
30723,BOOK III.,So burnt by Rudra Andhak(477) fell
30724,BOOK III.,In Svetáranya's silvery dell:
30725,BOOK III.,So Namuchi and Vritra(478) died
30726,BOOK III.,By steaming bolts that tamed their pride:
30727,BOOK III.,So Bala(479) fell by lightning sent
30728,BOOK III.,By Him who rules the firmament.
30729,BOOK III.,
30730,BOOK III.,Then all the Gods in close array
30731,BOOK III.,"With the bright hosts who sing and play,"
30732,BOOK III.,"Filled full of rapture and amaze,"
30733,BOOK III.,"Sang hymns of joy in Ráma's praise,"
30734,BOOK III.,Beat their celestial drums and shed
30735,BOOK III.,Rain of sweet flowers upon his head.
30736,BOOK III.,"For three short hours had scarcely flown,"
30737,BOOK III.,And by his pointed shafts o'erthrown
30738,BOOK III.,"The twice seven thousand fiends, whose will"
30739,BOOK III.,"Could change their shapes, in death were still,"
30740,BOOK III.,"With Trisirás and Dúshan slain,"
30741,BOOK III.,"And Khara, leader of the train."
30742,BOOK III.,"""O wondrous deed,"" the bards began,"
30743,BOOK III.,"""The noblest deed of virtuous man!"
30744,BOOK III.,"Heroic strength that stood alone,"
30745,BOOK III.,"And firmness e'en as Vishnu's own!"""
30746,BOOK III.,
30747,BOOK III.,"Thus having sung, the shining train"
30748,BOOK III.,Turned to their heavenly homes again.
30749,BOOK III.,Then the high saints of royal race
30750,BOOK III.,"And loftiest station sought the place,"
30751,BOOK III.,"And by the great Agastya led,"
30752,BOOK III.,With reverence to Ráma said:
30753,BOOK III.,
30754,BOOK III.,"""For this, Lord Indra, glorious sire,"
30755,BOOK III.,"Majestic as the burning fire,"
30756,BOOK III.,"Who crushes cities in his rage,"
30757,BOOK III.,Sought Sarabhanga's hermitage.
30758,BOOK III.,"Thou wast, this great design to aid,"
30759,BOOK III.,"Led by the saints to seek this shade,"
30760,BOOK III.,And with thy mighty arm to kill
30761,BOOK III.,The giants who delight in ill.
30762,BOOK III.,"Thou Dasaratha's noble son,"
30763,BOOK III.,"The battle for our sake hast won,"
30764,BOOK III.,And saints in Dandak's wild who live
30765,BOOK III.,"Their days to holy tasks can give."""
30766,BOOK III.,
30767,BOOK III.,Forth from the mountain cavern came
30768,BOOK III.,The hero Lakshman with the dame.
30769,BOOK III.,"And rapture beaming from his face,"
30770,BOOK III.,Resought the hermit dwelling-place.
30771,BOOK III.,Then when the mighty saints had paid
30772,BOOK III.,"Due honour for the victor's aid,"
30773,BOOK III.,The glorious Ráma honoured too
30774,BOOK III.,By Lakshman to his cot withdrew.
30775,BOOK III.,"When Sítá looked upon her lord,"
30776,BOOK III.,"His foemen slain, the saints restored,"
30777,BOOK III.,In pride and rapture uncontrolled
30778,BOOK III.,She clasped him in her loving hold.
30779,BOOK III.,On the dead fiends her glances fell:
30780,BOOK III.,"She saw her lord alive and well,"
30781,BOOK III.,"Victorious after toil and pain,"
30782,BOOK III.,And Janak's child was blest again.
30783,BOOK III.,"Once more, once more with new delight"
30784,BOOK III.,Her tender arms she threw
30785,BOOK III.,Round Ráma whose victorious might
30786,BOOK III.,Had crushed the demon crew.
30787,BOOK III.,Then as his grateful reverence paid
30788,BOOK III.,"Each saint of lofty soul,"
30789,BOOK III.,"O'er her sweet face, all fears allayed,"
30790,BOOK III.,The flush of transport stole.
30791,BOOK III.,
30792,BOOK III.,
30793,BOOK III.,
30794,BOOK III.,
30795,BOOK III.,Canto XXXI. Rávan.
30796,BOOK III.,
30797,BOOK III.,
30798,BOOK III.,"But of the host of giants one,"
30799,BOOK III.,"Akampan, from the field had run"
30800,BOOK III.,And sped to Lanká(480) to relate
30801,BOOK III.,In Rávan's ear the demons' fate:
30802,BOOK III.,
30803,BOOK III.,"""King, many a giant from the shade"
30804,BOOK III.,Of Janasthán in death is laid:
30805,BOOK III.,"Khara the chief is slain, and I"
30806,BOOK III.,"Could scarcely from the battle fly."""
30807,BOOK III.,
30808,BOOK III.,"Fierce anger, as the monarch heard,"
30809,BOOK III.,"Inflamed his look, his bosom stirred,"
30810,BOOK III.,And while with scorching glance he eyed
30811,BOOK III.,"The messenger, he thus replied:"
30812,BOOK III.,
30813,BOOK III.,"""What fool has dared, already dead,"
30814,BOOK III.,"Strike Janasthán, the general dread?"
30815,BOOK III.,Who is the wretch shall vainly try
30816,BOOK III.,"In earth, heaven, hell, from me to fly?"
30817,BOOK III.,"Vaisravan,(481) Indra, Vishnu, He"
30818,BOOK III.,"Who rules the dead, must reverence me;"
30819,BOOK III.,For not the mightiest lord of these
30820,BOOK III.,Can brave my will and live at ease.
30821,BOOK III.,Fate finds in me a mightier fate
30822,BOOK III.,To burn the fires that devastate.
30823,BOOK III.,With unresisted influence I
30824,BOOK III.,"Can force e'en Death himself to die,"
30825,BOOK III.,With all-surpassing might restrain
30826,BOOK III.,"The fury of the hurricane,"
30827,BOOK III.,And burn in my tremendous ire
30828,BOOK III.,"The glory of the sun and fire."""
30829,BOOK III.,
30830,BOOK III.,"As thus the fiend's hot fury blazed,"
30831,BOOK III.,"His trembling hands Akampan raised,"
30832,BOOK III.,"And with a voice which fear made weak,"
30833,BOOK III.,Permission craved his tale to speak.
30834,BOOK III.,"King Rávan gave the leave he sought,"
30835,BOOK III.,And bade him tell the news he brought.
30836,BOOK III.,"His courage rose, his voice grew bold,"
30837,BOOK III.,And thus his mournful tale he told:
30838,BOOK III.,
30839,BOOK III.,"""A prince with mighty shoulders, sprung"
30840,BOOK III.,"From Dasaratha, brave and young,"
30841,BOOK III.,"With arms well moulded, bears the name"
30842,BOOK III.,Of Ráma with a lion's frame.
30843,BOOK III.,"Renowned, successful, dark of limb,"
30844,BOOK III.,Earth has no warrior equals him.
30845,BOOK III.,He fought in Janasthán and slew
30846,BOOK III.,"Dúshan the fierce and Khara too."""
30847,BOOK III.,
30848,BOOK III.,Rávan the giants' royal chief.
30849,BOOK III.,Received Akampan's tale of grief.
30850,BOOK III.,"Then, panting like an angry snake,"
30851,BOOK III.,These words in turn the monarch spake:
30852,BOOK III.,
30853,BOOK III.,"""Say quick, did Ráma seek the shade"
30854,BOOK III.,"Of Janasthán with Indra's aid,"
30855,BOOK III.,And all the dwellers in the skies
30856,BOOK III.,"To back his hardy enterprise?"""
30857,BOOK III.,
30858,BOOK III.,"Akampan heard, and straight obeyed"
30859,BOOK III.,"His master, and his answer made."
30860,BOOK III.,Then thus the power and might he told
30861,BOOK III.,Of Raghu's son the lofty-souled:
30862,BOOK III.,
30863,BOOK III.,"""Best is that chief of all who know"
30864,BOOK III.,With deftest art to draw the bow.
30865,BOOK III.,"His are strange arms of heavenly might,"
30866,BOOK III.,And none can match him in the fight.
30867,BOOK III.,"His brother Lakshman brave as he,"
30868,BOOK III.,"Fair as the rounded moon to see,"
30869,BOOK III.,With eyes like night and voice that comes
30870,BOOK III.,"Deep as the roll of beaten drums,"
30871,BOOK III.,"By Ráma's side stands ever near,"
30872,BOOK III.,Like wind that aids the flame's career.
30873,BOOK III.,"That glorious chief, that prince of kings,"
30874,BOOK III.,On Janasthán this ruin brings.
30875,BOOK III.,"No Gods were there,--dismiss the thought"
30876,BOOK III.,No heavenly legions came and fought.
30877,BOOK III.,"His swift-winged arrows Ráma sent,"
30878,BOOK III.,Each bright with gold and ornament.
30879,BOOK III.,To serpents many-faced they turned:
30880,BOOK III.,The giant hosts they ate and burned.
30881,BOOK III.,Where'er these fled in wild dismay
30882,BOOK III.,Ráma was there to strike and slay.
30883,BOOK III.,"By him O King of high estate,"
30884,BOOK III.,"Is Janasthán left desolate."""
30885,BOOK III.,
30886,BOOK III.,Akampan ceased: in angry pride
30887,BOOK III.,The giant monarch thus replied:
30888,BOOK III.,"""To Janasthán myself will go"
30889,BOOK III.,"And lay these daring brothers low."""
30890,BOOK III.,
30891,BOOK III.,Thus spoke the king in furious mood:
30892,BOOK III.,Akampan then his speech renewed:
30893,BOOK III.,"""O listen while I tell at length"
30894,BOOK III.,The terror of the hero's strength.
30895,BOOK III.,"No power can check, no might can tame"
30896,BOOK III.,"Ráma, a chief of noblest fame."
30897,BOOK III.,He with resistless shafts can stay
30898,BOOK III.,The torrent foaming on its way.
30899,BOOK III.,"Sky, stars, and constellations, all"
30900,BOOK III.,To his fierce might would yield and fall.
30901,BOOK III.,His power could earth itself uphold
30902,BOOK III.,Down sinking as it sank of old.(482)
30903,BOOK III.,"Or all its plains and cities drown,"
30904,BOOK III.,Breaking the wild sea's barrier down;
30905,BOOK III.,"Crush the great deep's impetuous will,"
30906,BOOK III.,Or bid the furious wind be still.
30907,BOOK III.,He glorious in his high estate
30908,BOOK III.,"The triple world could devastate,"
30909,BOOK III.,"And there, supreme of men, could place"
30910,BOOK III.,His creatures of a new-born race.
30911,BOOK III.,Never can mighty Ráma be
30912,BOOK III.,"O'ercome in fight, my King, by thee."
30913,BOOK III.,Thy giant host the day might win
30914,BOOK III.,"From him, if heaven were gained by sin."
30915,BOOK III.,"If Gods were joined with demons, they"
30916,BOOK III.,"Could ne'er, I ween, that hero slay,"
30917,BOOK III.,But guile may kill the wondrous man;
30918,BOOK III.,Attend while I disclose the plan.
30919,BOOK III.,"His wife, above all women graced,"
30920,BOOK III.,"Is Sítá of the dainty waist,"
30921,BOOK III.,"With limbs to fair proportion true,"
30922,BOOK III.,"And a soft skin of lustrous hue,"
30923,BOOK III.,Round neck and arm rich gems are twined:
30924,BOOK III.,She is the gem of womankind.
30925,BOOK III.,"With her no bright Gandharví vies,"
30926,BOOK III.,No nymph or Goddess in the skies;
30927,BOOK III.,And none to rival her would dare
30928,BOOK III.,'Mid dames who part the long black hair.
30929,BOOK III.,"That hero in the wood beguile,"
30930,BOOK III.,And steal his lovely spouse the while.
30931,BOOK III.,"Reft of his darling wife, be sure,"
30932,BOOK III.,"Brief days the mourner will endure."""
30933,BOOK III.,
30934,BOOK III.,With flattering hope of triumph moved
30935,BOOK III.,"The giant king that plan approved,"
30936,BOOK III.,"Pondered the counsel in his breast,"
30937,BOOK III.,And then Akampan thus addressed:
30938,BOOK III.,"""Forth in my car I go at morn,"
30939,BOOK III.,"None but the driver with me borne,"
30940,BOOK III.,And this fair Sítá will I bring
30941,BOOK III.,"Back to my city triumphing."""
30942,BOOK III.,
30943,BOOK III.,Forth in his car by asses drawn
30944,BOOK III.,"The giant monarch sped at dawn,"
30945,BOOK III.,"Bright as the sun, the chariot cast"
30946,BOOK III.,Light through the sky as on it passed.
30947,BOOK III.,Then high in air that best of cars
30948,BOOK III.,"Traversed the path of lunar stars,"
30949,BOOK III.,Sending a fitful radiance pale
30950,BOOK III.,As moonbeams shot through cloudy veil.
30951,BOOK III.,Far on his airy way he flew:
30952,BOOK III.,Near Tádakeya's(483) grove he drew.
30953,BOOK III.,"Márícha welcomed him, and placed"
30954,BOOK III.,"Before him food which giants taste,"
30955,BOOK III.,"With honour led him to a seat,"
30956,BOOK III.,And brought him water for his feet;
30957,BOOK III.,And then with timely words addressed
30958,BOOK III.,Such question to his royal guest:
30959,BOOK III.,
30960,BOOK III.,"""Speak, is it well with thee whose sway"
30961,BOOK III.,The giant multitudes obey?
30962,BOOK III.,"I know not all, and ask in fear"
30963,BOOK III.,"The cause, O King, why thou art here."""
30964,BOOK III.,
30965,BOOK III.,"Ráva, the giants' mighty king,"
30966,BOOK III.,"Heard wise Márícha's questioning,"
30967,BOOK III.,"And told with ready answer, taught"
30968,BOOK III.,"In eloquence, the cause he sought:"
30969,BOOK III.,"""My guards, the bravest of my band,"
30970,BOOK III.,"Are slain by Ráma's vigorous hand,"
30971,BOOK III.,"And Janasthán, that feared no hate"
30972,BOOK III.,"Of foes, is rendered desolate."
30973,BOOK III.,"Come, aid me in the plan I lay"
30974,BOOK III.,"To steal the conqueror's wife away."""
30975,BOOK III.,
30976,BOOK III.,"Márícha heard the king's request,"
30977,BOOK III.,And thus the giant chief addressed:
30978,BOOK III.,
30979,BOOK III.,"""What foe in friendly guise is he"
30980,BOOK III.,Who spoke of Sítá's name to thee?
30981,BOOK III.,Who is the wretch whose thought would bring
30982,BOOK III.,Destruction on the giants' king?
30983,BOOK III.,"Whose is the evil counsel, say,"
30984,BOOK III.,"That bids thee bear his wife away,"
30985,BOOK III.,And careless of thy life provoke
30986,BOOK III.,Earth's loftiest with threatening stroke?
30987,BOOK III.,A foe is he who dared suggest
30988,BOOK III.,"This hopeless folly to thy breast,"
30989,BOOK III.,Whose ill advice would bid thee draw
30990,BOOK III.,The venomed fang from serpent's jaw.
30991,BOOK III.,By whose unwise suggestion led
30992,BOOK III.,Wilt thou the path of ruin tread?
30993,BOOK III.,Whence falls the blow that would destroy
30994,BOOK III.,Thy gentle sleep of ease and joy?
30995,BOOK III.,Like some wild elephant is he
30996,BOOK III.,"That rears his trunk on high,"
30997,BOOK III.,"Lord of an ancient pedigree,"
30998,BOOK III.,"Huge tusks, and furious eye."
30999,BOOK III.,"Rávan, no rover of the night"
31000,BOOK III.,"With bravest heart can brook,"
31001,BOOK III.,"Met in the front of deadly fight,"
31002,BOOK III.,On Raghu's son to look.
31003,BOOK III.,"The giant hosts were brave and strong,"
31004,BOOK III.,Good at the bow and spear:
31005,BOOK III.,"But Ráma slew the routed throng,"
31006,BOOK III.,A lion 'mid the deer.
31007,BOOK III.,"No lion's tooth can match his sword,"
31008,BOOK III.,Or arrows fiercely shot:
31009,BOOK III.,"He sleeps, he sleeps--the lion lord;"
31010,BOOK III.,Be wise and rouse him not.
31011,BOOK III.,"O Monarch of the giants, well"
31012,BOOK III.,"Upon my counsel think,"
31013,BOOK III.,Lest thou for ever in the hell
31014,BOOK III.,Of Ráma's vengeance sink:
31015,BOOK III.,"A hell, where deadly shafts are sent"
31016,BOOK III.,"From his tremendous-bow,"
31017,BOOK III.,"While his great arms all flight prevent,"
31018,BOOK III.,Like deepest mire below:
31019,BOOK III.,Where the wild floods of battle rave
31020,BOOK III.,"Above the foeman's head,"
31021,BOOK III.,And each with many a feathery wave
31022,BOOK III.,Of shafts is garlanded.
31023,BOOK III.,"O, quench the flames that in thy breast"
31024,BOOK III.,With raging fury burn;
31025,BOOK III.,And pacified and self-possessed
31026,BOOK III.,To Lanká's town return.
31027,BOOK III.,Rest thou in her imperial bowers
31028,BOOK III.,"With thine own wives content,"
31029,BOOK III.,And in the wood let Ráma's hours
31030,BOOK III.,"With Sítá still be spent."""
31031,BOOK III.,
31032,BOOK III.,The lord of Lanká's isle obeyed
31033,BOOK III.,"The counsel, and his purpose stayed."
31034,BOOK III.,Borne on his car he parted thence
31035,BOOK III.,And gained his royal residence.

31044,BOOK III.,"Spread with the fourteen thousand slain,"
31045,BOOK III.,Doers of cruel deeds o'erthrown
31046,BOOK III.,"By Ráma's mighty arm alone,"
31047,BOOK III.,"Add Trisirás and Dúshan dead,"
31048,BOOK III.,"And Khara, with the hosts they led."
31049,BOOK III.,"Their death she saw, and mad with pain,"
31050,BOOK III.,"Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,"
31051,BOOK III.,And fled in anger and dismay
31052,BOOK III.,"To Lanká, seat of Rávan's sway."
31053,BOOK III.,There on a throne of royal state
31054,BOOK III.,"Exalted sat the potentate,"
31055,BOOK III.,"Begirt with counsellor and peer,"
31056,BOOK III.,Like Indra with the Storm Gods near.
31057,BOOK III.,Bright as the sun's full splendour shone
31058,BOOK III.,"The glorious throne he sat upon,"
31059,BOOK III.,As when the blazing fire is red
31060,BOOK III.,Upon a golden altar fed.
31061,BOOK III.,"Wide gaped his mouth at every breath,"
31062,BOOK III.,Tremendous as the jaws of Death.
31063,BOOK III.,"With him high saints of lofty thought,"
31064,BOOK III.,"Gandharvas, Gods, had vainly fought."
31065,BOOK III.,The wounds were on his body yet
31066,BOOK III.,From wars where Gods and demons met.
31067,BOOK III.,And scars still marked his ample chest
31068,BOOK III.,By fierce Airávat's(484) tusk impressed.
31069,BOOK III.,"A score of arms, ten necks, had he,"
31070,BOOK III.,His royal gear was brave to see.
31071,BOOK III.,His massive form displayed each sign
31072,BOOK III.,That marks the heir of kingly line.
31073,BOOK III.,"In stature like a mountain height,"
31074,BOOK III.,"His arms were strong, his teeth were white,"
31075,BOOK III.,And all his frame of massive mould
31076,BOOK III.,Seemed lazulite adorned with gold.
31077,BOOK III.,A hundred seams impressed each limp
31078,BOOK III.,"Where Vishnu's arm had wounded him,"
31079,BOOK III.,And chest and shoulder bore the print
31080,BOOK III.,"Of sword and spear and arrow dint,"
31081,BOOK III.,Where every God had struck a blow
31082,BOOK III.,In battle with the giant foe.
31083,BOOK III.,His might to wildest rage could wake
31084,BOOK III.,"The sea whose faith naught else can shake,"
31085,BOOK III.,"Hurl towering mountains to the earth,"
31086,BOOK III.,And crush e'en foes of heavenly birth.
31087,BOOK III.,The bonds of law and right he spurned:
31088,BOOK III.,To others' wives his fancy turned.
31089,BOOK III.,"Celestial arms he used in fight,"
31090,BOOK III.,And loved to mar each holy rite.
31091,BOOK III.,"He went to Bhogavatí's town,(485)"
31092,BOOK III.,"Where Vásuki was beaten down,"
31093,BOOK III.,"And stole, victorious in the strife,"
31094,BOOK III.,Lord Takshaka's beloved wife.
31095,BOOK III.,"Kailása's lofty crest he sought,"
31096,BOOK III.,"And when in vain Kuvera fought,"
31097,BOOK III.,"Stole Pushpak thence, the car that through"
31098,BOOK III.,"The air, as willed the master, flew."
31099,BOOK III.,"Impelled by furious anger, he"
31100,BOOK III.,"Spoiled Nandan's(486) shade and Naliní,"
31101,BOOK III.,"And Chaitraratha's heavenly grove,"
31102,BOOK III.,The haunts where Gods delight to rove.
31103,BOOK III.,"Tall as a hill that cleaves the sky,"
31104,BOOK III.,He raised his mighty arms on high
31105,BOOK III.,"To check the blessed moon, and stay"
31106,BOOK III.,The rising of the Lord of Day.
31107,BOOK III.,Ten thousand years the giant spent
31108,BOOK III.,"On dire austerities intent,"
31109,BOOK III.,"And of his heads an offering, laid"
31110,BOOK III.,"Before the Self-existent, made."
31111,BOOK III.,"No God or fiend his life could take,"
31112,BOOK III.,"Gandharva, goblin, bird, or snake:"
31113,BOOK III.,"Safe from all fears of death, except"
31114,BOOK III.,"From human arm, that life was kept."
31115,BOOK III.,Oft when the priests began to raise
31116,BOOK III.,"Their consecrating hymns of praise,"
31117,BOOK III.,He spoiled the Soma's sacred juice
31118,BOOK III.,Poured forth by them in solemn use.
31119,BOOK III.,"The sacrifice his hands o'erthrew,"
31120,BOOK III.,And cruelly the Bráhmans slew.
31121,BOOK III.,"His was a heart that naught could melt,"
31122,BOOK III.,Joying in woes which others felt.
31123,BOOK III.,
31124,BOOK III.,"She saw the ruthless monster there,"
31125,BOOK III.,"Dread of the worlds, unused to spare."
31126,BOOK III.,"In robes of heavenly texture dressed,"
31127,BOOK III.,Celestial wreaths adorned his breast.
31128,BOOK III.,"He sat a shape of terror, like"
31129,BOOK III.,Destruction ere the worlds it strike.
31130,BOOK III.,"She saw him in his pride of place,"
31131,BOOK III.,"The joy of old Pulastya's(487) race,"
31132,BOOK III.,"Begirt by counsellor and peer,"
31133,BOOK III.,"Rávan, the foeman's mortal fear,"
31134,BOOK III.,"And terror in her features shown,"
31135,BOOK III.,The giantess approached the throne.
31136,BOOK III.,Then Súrpanakhá bearing yet
31137,BOOK III.,Each deeply printed trace
31138,BOOK III.,Where the great-hearted chief had set
31139,BOOK III.,"A mark upon her face,"
31140,BOOK III.,"Impelled by terror and desire,"
31141,BOOK III.,"Still fierce, no longer bold,"

31152,BOOK III.,"Of counsellors who girt their king,"
31153,BOOK III.,"To Rávan, ravener of man,"
31154,BOOK III.,With bitter words she thus began:
31155,BOOK III.,
31156,BOOK III.,"""Wilt thou absorbed in pleasure, still"
31157,BOOK III.,Pursue unchecked thy selfish will:
31158,BOOK III.,Nor turn thy heedless eyes to see
31159,BOOK III.,The coming fate which threatens thee?
31160,BOOK III.,The king who days and hours employs
31161,BOOK III.,In base pursuit of vulgar joys
31162,BOOK III.,Must in his people's sight be vile
31163,BOOK III.,As fire that smokes on funeral pile.
31164,BOOK III.,He who when duty calls him spares
31165,BOOK III.,"No time for thought of royal cares,"
31166,BOOK III.,Must with his realm and people all
31167,BOOK III.,Involved in fatal ruin fall.
31168,BOOK III.,As elephants in terror shrink
31169,BOOK III.,"From the false river's miry brink,"
31170,BOOK III.,Thus subjects from a monarch flee
31171,BOOK III.,"Whose face their eyes may seldom see,"
31172,BOOK III.,Who spends the hours for toil ordained
31173,BOOK III.,In evil courses unrestrained.
31174,BOOK III.,He who neglects to guard and hold
31175,BOOK III.,"His kingdom by himself controlled,"
31176,BOOK III.,Sinks nameless like a hill whose head
31177,BOOK III.,Is buried in the ocean's bed.
31178,BOOK III.,"Thy foes are calm and strong and wise,"
31179,BOOK III.,"Fiends, Gods, and warriors of the skies,--"
31180,BOOK III.,"How, heedless, wicked, weak, and vain,"
31181,BOOK III.,Wilt thou thy kingly state maintain?

31183,BOOK III.,"Slave of each changing influence,"
31184,BOOK III.,"Heedless of all that makes a king,"
31185,BOOK III.,Destruction on thy head wilt bring.
31186,BOOK III.,"O conquering chief, the prince, who boasts,"
31187,BOOK III.,"Of treasury and rule and hosts,"
31188,BOOK III.,"By others led, though lord of all,"
31189,BOOK III.,Is meaner than the lowest thrall.
31190,BOOK III.,For this are monarchs said to be
31191,BOOK III.,"Long-sighted, having power to see"
31192,BOOK III.,Things far away by faithful eyes
31193,BOOK III.,Of messengers and loyal spies.
31194,BOOK III.,But aid from such thou wilt not seek:
31195,BOOK III.,"Thy counsellors are blind and weak,"
31196,BOOK III.,Or thou from these hadst surely known
31197,BOOK III.,Thy legions and thy realm o'erthrown.
31198,BOOK III.,"Know, twice seven thousand, fierce in might,"
31199,BOOK III.,"Are slain by Ráma in the fight,"
31200,BOOK III.,"And they, the giant host who led,"
31201,BOOK III.,"Khara and Dúshan, both are dead."
31202,BOOK III.,"Know, Ráma with his conquering arm"
31203,BOOK III.,"Has freed the saints from dread of harm,"
31204,BOOK III.,Has smitten Janasthán and made
31205,BOOK III.,Asylum safe in Dandak's shade.
31206,BOOK III.,"Enslaved and dull, of blinded sight,"
31207,BOOK III.,"Intoxicate with vain delight,"
31208,BOOK III.,Thou closest still thy heedless eyes
31209,BOOK III.,To dangers in thy realm that rise.
31210,BOOK III.,"A king besotted, mean, unkind,"
31211,BOOK III.,Of niggard hand and slavish mind.
31212,BOOK III.,Will find no faithful followers heed
31213,BOOK III.,Their master in his hour of need.
31214,BOOK III.,"The friend on whom he most relies,"
31215,BOOK III.,"In danger, from a monarch flies,"
31216,BOOK III.,"Imperious in his high estate,"
31217,BOOK III.,"Conceited, proud, and passionate;"
31218,BOOK III.,Who ne'er to state affairs attends
31219,BOOK III.,With wholesome fear when woe impends
31220,BOOK III.,"Most weak and worthless as the grass,"
31221,BOOK III.,Soon from his sway the realm will pass.
31222,BOOK III.,"For rotting wood a use is found,"
31223,BOOK III.,"For clods and dust that strew the ground,"
31224,BOOK III.,"But when a king has lost his sway,"
31225,BOOK III.,"Useless he falls, and sinks for aye."
31226,BOOK III.,"As raiment by another worn,"
31227,BOOK III.,"As faded garland crushed and torn,"
31228,BOOK III.,"So is, unthroned, the proudest king,"
31229,BOOK III.,"Though mighty once, a useless thing."
31230,BOOK III.,But he who every sense subdues
31231,BOOK III.,"And each event observant views,"
31232,BOOK III.,"Rewards the good and keeps from wrong,"
31233,BOOK III.,Shall reign secure and flourish long.
31234,BOOK III.,Though lulled in sleep his senses lie
31235,BOOK III.,"He watches with a ruler's eye,"
31236,BOOK III.,"Untouched by favour, ire, and hate,"
31237,BOOK III.,And him the people celebrate.
31238,BOOK III.,"O weak of mind, without a trace"
31239,BOOK III.,"Of virtues that a king should grace,"
31240,BOOK III.,Who hast not learnt from watchful spy
31241,BOOK III.,That low in death the giants lie.
31242,BOOK III.,"Scorner of others, but enchained"
31243,BOOK III.,"By every base desire,"

31248,BOOK III.,"The good from evil to discern,"
31249,BOOK III.,"Fall from thy high estate."""
31250,BOOK III.,As thus she ceased not to upbraid
31251,BOOK III.,"The king with cutting speech,"
31252,BOOK III.,"And every fault to view displayed,"
31253,BOOK III.,"Naming and marking each,"
31254,BOOK III.,"The monarch of the sons of night,"
31255,BOOK III.,"Of wealth and power possessed,"

31265,BOOK III.,Then forth the giant's fury broke
31266,BOOK III.,As Súrpanakhá harshly spoke.
31267,BOOK III.,Girt by his lords the demon king
31268,BOOK III.,"Looked on her, fiercely questioning:"
31269,BOOK III.,
31270,BOOK III.,"""Who is this Ráma, whence, and where?"
31271,BOOK III.,"His form, his might, his deeds declare."
31272,BOOK III.,His wandering steps what purpose led
31273,BOOK III.,"To Dandak forest, hard to tread?"
31274,BOOK III.,What arms are his that he could smite
31275,BOOK III.,"In fray the rovers of the night,"
31276,BOOK III.,And Trisirás and Dúshan lay
31277,BOOK III.,"Low on the earth, and Khara slay?"
31278,BOOK III.,"Tell all, my sister, and declare"
31279,BOOK III.,"Who maimed thee thus, of form most fair."""
31280,BOOK III.,
31281,BOOK III.,"Thus by the giant king addressed,"
31282,BOOK III.,"While burnt her fury unrepressed,"
31283,BOOK III.,The giantess declared at length
31284,BOOK III.,The hero's form and deeds and strength:
31285,BOOK III.,
31286,BOOK III.,"""Long are his arms and large his eyes:"
31287,BOOK III.,A black deer's skin his dress supplies.
31288,BOOK III.,"King Dasaratha's son is he,"
31289,BOOK III.,Fair as Kandarpa's self to see.
31290,BOOK III.,"Adorned with many a golden band,"
31291,BOOK III.,"A bow, like Indra's, arms his hand,"
31292,BOOK III.,And shoots a flood of arrows fierce
31293,BOOK III.,As venomed snakes to burn and pierce.
31294,BOOK III.,"I looked, I looked, but never saw"
31295,BOOK III.,His mighty hand the bowstring draw
31296,BOOK III.,"That sent the deadly arrows out,"
31297,BOOK III.,While rang through air his battle-shout.
31298,BOOK III.,"I looked, I looked, and saw too well"
31299,BOOK III.,"How with that hail the giants fell,"
31300,BOOK III.,"As falls to earth the golden grain,"
31301,BOOK III.,Struck by the blows of Indra's rain.
31302,BOOK III.,"He fought, and twice seven thousand, all"
31303,BOOK III.,"Terrific giants, strong and tall,"
31304,BOOK III.,Fell by the pointed shafts o'erthrown
31305,BOOK III.,"Which Ráma shot on foot, alone."
31306,BOOK III.,"Three little hours had scarcely fled,--"
31307,BOOK III.,"Khara and Dúshan both were dead,"
31308,BOOK III.,And he had freed the saints and made
31309,BOOK III.,Asylum sure in Dandak's shade.
31310,BOOK III.,"Me of his grace the victor spared,"
31311,BOOK III.,Or I the giants' fate had shared.
31312,BOOK III.,The high-souled Ráma would not deign
31313,BOOK III.,His hand with woman's blood to stain.
31314,BOOK III.,"The glorious Lakshman, justly dear,"
31315,BOOK III.,"In gifts and warrior might his peer,"
31316,BOOK III.,Serves his great brother with the whole
31317,BOOK III.,Devotion of his faithful soul:
31318,BOOK III.,"Impetuous victor, bold and wise,"
31319,BOOK III.,"First in each hardy enterprise,"
31320,BOOK III.,"Still ready by his side to stand,"
31321,BOOK III.,A second self or better hand.
31322,BOOK III.,"And Ráma has a large-eyed spouse,"
31323,BOOK III.,"Pure as the moon her cheek and brows,"
31324,BOOK III.,"Dearer than life in Ráma's sight,"
31325,BOOK III.,Whose happiness is her delight.
31326,BOOK III.,With beauteous hair and nose the dame
31327,BOOK III.,From head to foot has naught to blame.
31328,BOOK III.,"She shines the wood's bright Goddess, Queen"
31329,BOOK III.,Of beauty with her noble mien.
31330,BOOK III.,First in the ranks of women placed
31331,BOOK III.,Is Sítá of the dainty waist.
31332,BOOK III.,In all the earth mine eyes have ne'er
31333,BOOK III.,Seen female form so sweetly fair.
31334,BOOK III.,"Goddess nor nymph can vie with her,"
31335,BOOK III.,Nor bride of heavenly chorister.
31336,BOOK III.,"He who might call this dame his own,"
31337,BOOK III.,"Her eager arms about him thrown,"
31338,BOOK III.,Would live more blest in Sítá's love
31339,BOOK III.,Than Indra in the world above.
31340,BOOK III.,"She, peerless in her form and face"
31341,BOOK III.,"And rich in every gentle grace,"
31342,BOOK III.,"Is worthy bride, O King, for thee,"
31343,BOOK III.,As thou art meet her lord to be.
31344,BOOK III.,"I even I, will bring the bride"
31345,BOOK III.,In triumph to her lover's side--
31346,BOOK III.,"This beauty fairer than the rest,"
31347,BOOK III.,With rounded limb and heaving breast.
31348,BOOK III.,Each wound upon my face I owe
31349,BOOK III.,To cruel Lakshman's savage blow.
31350,BOOK III.,"But thou, O brother, shalt survey"
31351,BOOK III.,"Her moonlike loveliness to-day,"
31352,BOOK III.,And Káma's piercing shafts shall smite
31353,BOOK III.,Thine amorous bosom at the sight.
31354,BOOK III.,If in thy breast the longing rise
31355,BOOK III.,"To make thine own the beauteous prize,"
31356,BOOK III.,"Up, let thy better foot begin"

31358,BOOK III.,"If, giant Lord, thy favouring eyes"

31360,BOOK III.,"Up, cast all fear and doubt away"
31361,BOOK III.,And execute the words I say
31362,BOOK III.,"Come, giant King, this treasure seek,"
31363,BOOK III.,For thou art strong and they are weak.

31365,BOOK III.,Be borne away and be thy dame.
31366,BOOK III.,Thy host in Janasthán who dwelt
31367,BOOK III.,Forth to the battle hied.
31368,BOOK III.,And by the shafts which Ráma dealt
31369,BOOK III.,They perished in their pride.
31370,BOOK III.,"Dúshan and Khara breathe no more,"
31371,BOOK III.,Laid low upon the plain.

31381,BOOK III.,"When Rávan, by her fury spurred,"
31382,BOOK III.,"That terrible advice had heard,"
31383,BOOK III.,"He bade his nobles quit his side,"
31384,BOOK III.,And to the work his thought applied.
31385,BOOK III.,He turned his anxious mind to scan
31386,BOOK III.,On every side the hardy plan:
31387,BOOK III.,"The gain against the risk he laid,"
31388,BOOK III.,"Each hope and fear with care surveyed,"
31389,BOOK III.,And in his heart at length decreed
31390,BOOK III.,To try performance of the deed.
31391,BOOK III.,Then steady in his dire intent
31392,BOOK III.,The giant to the courtyard went.
31393,BOOK III.,"There to his charioteer he cried,"
31394,BOOK III.,"""Bring forth the car whereon I ride."""
31395,BOOK III.,Aye ready at his master's word
31396,BOOK III.,"The charioteer the order heard,"
31397,BOOK III.,And yoked with active zeal the best
31398,BOOK III.,Of chariots at his lord's behest.
31399,BOOK III.,Asses with heads of goblins drew
31400,BOOK III.,That wondrous car where'er it flew.
31401,BOOK III.,Obedient to the will it rolled
31402,BOOK III.,Adorned with gems and glistering gold.
31403,BOOK III.,"Then mounting, with a roar as loud"
31404,BOOK III.,"As thunder from a labouring cloud,"
31405,BOOK III.,The mighty monarch to the tide
31406,BOOK III.,"Of Ocean, lord of rivers, hied."
31407,BOOK III.,"White was the shade above him spread,"
31408,BOOK III.,"White chouris waved around his head,"
31409,BOOK III.,And he with gold and jewels bright
31410,BOOK III.,Shone like the glossy lazulite.
31411,BOOK III.,Ten necks and twenty arms had he:
31412,BOOK III.,His royal gear was good to see.
31413,BOOK III.,"The heavenly Gods' insatiate foe,"
31414,BOOK III.,"Who made the blood of hermits flow,"
31415,BOOK III.,He like the Lord of Hills appeared
31416,BOOK III.,With ten huge heads to heaven upreared.
31417,BOOK III.,"In the great car whereon he rode,"
31418,BOOK III.,"Like some dark cloud the giant showed,"
31419,BOOK III.,When round it in their close array
31420,BOOK III.,The cranes 'mid wreaths of lightning play.
31421,BOOK III.,"He looked, and saw, from realms of air,"
31422,BOOK III.,"The rocky shore of ocean, where"
31423,BOOK III.,Unnumbered trees delightful grew
31424,BOOK III.,With flower and fruit of every hue.
31425,BOOK III.,He looked on many a lilied pool
31426,BOOK III.,"With silvery waters fresh and cool,"
31427,BOOK III.,And shores like spacious altars meet
31428,BOOK III.,For holy hermits' lone retreat.
31429,BOOK III.,"The graceful palm adorned the scene,"
31430,BOOK III.,The plantain waved her glossy green.
31431,BOOK III.,"There grew the sál and betel, there"
31432,BOOK III.,On bending boughs the flowers were fair.
31433,BOOK III.,There hermits dwelt who tamed each sense
31434,BOOK III.,By strictest rule of abstinence:
31435,BOOK III.,"Gandharvas, Kinnars,(488) thronged the place,"
31436,BOOK III.,Nágas and birds of heavenly race.
31437,BOOK III.,"Bright minstrels of the ethereal quire,"
31438,BOOK III.,"And saints exempt from low desire,"
31439,BOOK III.,"With Ájas, sons of Brahmá's line,"
31440,BOOK III.,"Maríchipas of seed divine,"
31441,BOOK III.,"Vaikhánasas and Máshas strayed,"
31442,BOOK III.,And Bálakhilyas(489) in the shade.
31443,BOOK III.,"The lovely nymphs of heaven were there,"
31444,BOOK III.,"Celestial wreaths confined their hair,"
31445,BOOK III.,And to each form new grace was lent
31446,BOOK III.,By wealth of heavenly ornament.
31447,BOOK III.,Well skilled was each in play and dance
31448,BOOK III.,And gentle arts of dalliance.
31449,BOOK III.,The glorious wife of many a God
31450,BOOK III.,"Those beautiful recesses trod,"
31451,BOOK III.,"There Gods and Dánavs, all who eat"
31452,BOOK III.,"The food of heaven, rejoiced to meet."
31453,BOOK III.,The swan and Sáras thronged each bay
31454,BOOK III.,"With curlews, ducks, and divers gay,"
31455,BOOK III.,Where the sea spray rose soft and white
31456,BOOK III.,O'er rocks of glossy lazulite.
31457,BOOK III.,As his swift way the fiend pursued
31458,BOOK III.,"Pale chariots of the Gods he viewed,"
31459,BOOK III.,Bearing each lord whose rites austere
31460,BOOK III.,Had raised him to the heavenly sphere.
31461,BOOK III.,"Thereon celestial garlands hung,"
31462,BOOK III.,There music played and songs were sung.
31463,BOOK III.,"Then bright Gandharvas met his view,"
31464,BOOK III.,"And heavenly nymphs, as on he flew."
31465,BOOK III.,"He saw the sandal woods below,"
31466,BOOK III.,"And precious trees of odorous flow,"
31467,BOOK III.,That to the air around them lent
31468,BOOK III.,Their riches of delightful scent;
31469,BOOK III.,Nor failed his roving eye to mark
31470,BOOK III.,Tall aloe trees in grove and park.
31471,BOOK III.,"He looked on wood with cassias filled,"
31472,BOOK III.,"And plants which balmy sweets distilled,"
31473,BOOK III.,Where her fair flowers the betel showed
31474,BOOK III.,And the bright pods of pepper glowed.
31475,BOOK III.,The pearls in many a silvery heap
31476,BOOK III.,Lay on the margin of the deep.
31477,BOOK III.,And grey rocks rose amid the red
31478,BOOK III.,Of coral washed from ocean's bed.
31479,BOOK III.,High soared the mountain peaks that bore
31480,BOOK III.,"Treasures of gold and silver ore,"
31481,BOOK III.,And leaping down the rocky walls
31482,BOOK III.,Came wild and glorious waterfalls.
31483,BOOK III.,"Fair towns which grain and treasure held,"
31484,BOOK III.,"And dames who every gem excelled,"
31485,BOOK III.,"He saw outspread beneath him far,"
31486,BOOK III.,"With steed, and elephant, and car."
31487,BOOK III.,That ocean shore he viewed that showed
31488,BOOK III.,Fair as the blessed Gods' abode
31489,BOOK III.,Where cool delightful breezes played
31490,BOOK III.,O'er levels in the freshest shade.
31491,BOOK III.,He saw a fig-tree like a cloud
31492,BOOK III.,With mighty branches earthward bowed.
31493,BOOK III.,It stretched a hundred leagues and made
31494,BOOK III.,For hermit bands a welcome shade.
31495,BOOK III.,Thither the feathered king of yore
31496,BOOK III.,"An elephant and tortoise bore,"
31497,BOOK III.,And lighted on a bough to eat
31498,BOOK III.,The captives of his taloned feet.
31499,BOOK III.,The bough unable to sustain
31500,BOOK III.,"The crushing weight and sudden strain,"
31501,BOOK III.,Loaded with sprays and leaves of spring
31502,BOOK III.,Gave way beneath the feathered king.
31503,BOOK III.,Under the shadow of the tree
31504,BOOK III.,"Dwelt many a saint and devotee,"
31505,BOOK III.,"Ájas, the sons of Brahmá's line,"
31506,BOOK III.,"Máshas, Maríchipas divine."
31507,BOOK III.,"Vaikhánasas, and all the race"
31508,BOOK III.,"Of Bálakhilyas, loved the place."
31509,BOOK III.,But pitying their sad estate
31510,BOOK III.,The feathered monarch raised the weight
31511,BOOK III.,"Of the huge bough, and bore away"
31512,BOOK III.,The loosened load and captured prey.
31513,BOOK III.,"A hundred leagues away he sped,"
31514,BOOK III.,"Then on his monstrous booty fed,"
31515,BOOK III.,And with the bough he smote the lands
31516,BOOK III.,Where dwell the wild Nisháda bands.
31517,BOOK III.,High joy was his because his deed
31518,BOOK III.,From jeopardy the hermits freed.
31519,BOOK III.,That pride for great deliverance wrought
31520,BOOK III.,A double share of valour brought.
31521,BOOK III.,His soul conceived the high emprise
31522,BOOK III.,To snatch the Amrit from the skies.
31523,BOOK III.,"He rent the nets of iron first,"
31524,BOOK III.,"Then through the jewel chamber burst,"
31525,BOOK III.,And bore the drink of heaven away
31526,BOOK III.,That watched in Indra's palace lay.
31527,BOOK III.,
31528,BOOK III.,Such was the hermit-sheltering tree
31529,BOOK III.,Which Rávan turned his eye to see.
31530,BOOK III.,"Still marked where Garud sought to rest,"
31531,BOOK III.,The fig-tree bore the name of Blest.
31532,BOOK III.,
31533,BOOK III.,When Rávan stayed his chariot o'er
31534,BOOK III.,"The ocean's heart-enchanting shore,"
31535,BOOK III.,He saw a hermitage that stood
31536,BOOK III.,Sequestered in the holy wood.
31537,BOOK III.,He saw the fiend Márícha there
31538,BOOK III.,"With deerskin garb, and matted hair"
31539,BOOK III.,"Coiled up in hermit guise, who spent"
31540,BOOK III.,His days by rule most abstinent.
31541,BOOK III.,"As guest and host are wont to meet,"
31542,BOOK III.,They met within that lone retreat.
31543,BOOK III.,Before the king Márícha placed
31544,BOOK III.,Food never known to human taste.
31545,BOOK III.,He entertained his guest with meat
31546,BOOK III.,"And gave him water for his feet,"
31547,BOOK III.,And then addressed the giant king
31548,BOOK III.,With timely words of questioning:
31549,BOOK III.,
31550,BOOK III.,"""Lord, is it well with thee, and well"
31551,BOOK III.,With those in Lanká's town who dwell?
31552,BOOK III.,"What sudden thought, what urgent need"
31553,BOOK III.,"Has brought thee with impetuous speed?"""
31554,BOOK III.,
31555,BOOK III.,The fiend Márícha thus addressed
31556,BOOK III.,"Rávan the king, his mighty guest,"
31557,BOOK III.,"And he, well skilled in arts that guide"
31558,BOOK III.,"The eloquent, in turn replied:"

31581,BOOK III.,"Obedient to their captain's call,"

31587,BOOK III.,Met Ráma in the battle fray.
31588,BOOK III.,Girt with all weapons forth they sped
31589,BOOK III.,With Khara at the army's head.
31590,BOOK III.,The front of battle Ráma held:
31591,BOOK III.,With furious wrath his bosom swelled.
31592,BOOK III.,Without a word his hate to show
31593,BOOK III.,He launched the arrows from his bow.
31594,BOOK III.,"On the fierce hosts the missiles came,"
31595,BOOK III.,"Each burning with destructive flame,"

31599,BOOK III.,"And Dúshan, fearless warrior, died,"
31600,BOOK III.,"And Trisirás the fierce was slain,"
31601,BOOK III.,And Dandak wood was free again.
31602,BOOK III.,
31603,BOOK III.,"He, banished by his angry sire,"
31604,BOOK III.,Roams with his wife in mean attire.
31605,BOOK III.,"This wretch, his Warrior tribe's disgrace"
31606,BOOK III.,Has slain the best of giant race.
31607,BOOK III.,"Harsh, wicked, fierce and greedy-souled,"
31608,BOOK III.,"A fool, with senses uncontrolled,"
31609,BOOK III.,No thought of duty stirs his breast:
31610,BOOK III.,He joys to see the world distressed.
31611,BOOK III.,He sought the wood with fair pretence
31612,BOOK III.,"Of truthful life and innocence,"
31613,BOOK III.,But his false hand my sister left
31614,BOOK III.,"Mangled, of nose and ears bereft."
31615,BOOK III.,This Ráma's wife who bears the name
31616,BOOK III.,"Of Sítá, in her face and frame"
31617,BOOK III.,"Fair as a daughter of the skies,--"
31618,BOOK III.,Her will I seize and bring the prize
31619,BOOK III.,Triumphant from the forest shade:
31620,BOOK III.,For this I seek thy willing aid.
31621,BOOK III.,"If thou, O mighty one, wilt lend"
31622,BOOK III.,"Thy help and stand beside thy friend,"
31623,BOOK III.,I with my brothers may defy
31624,BOOK III.,All Gods embattled in the sky.
31625,BOOK III.,"Come, aid me now, for thine the power"
31626,BOOK III.,To succour in the doubtful hour.
31627,BOOK III.,"Thou art in war and time of fear,"
31628,BOOK III.,"For heart and hand, without a peer."
31629,BOOK III.,"For thou art skilled in art and wile,"
31630,BOOK III.,A warrior brave and trained in guile.
31631,BOOK III.,"With this one hope, this only aim,"
31632,BOOK III.,"O Rover of the Night, I came."
31633,BOOK III.,Now let me tell what aid I ask
31634,BOOK III.,To back me in my purposed task.
31635,BOOK III.,In semblance of a golden deer
31636,BOOK III.,Adorned with silver spots appear.
31637,BOOK III.,"Go, seek his dwelling: in the way"
31638,BOOK III.,Of Ráma and his consort stray.
31639,BOOK III.,"Doubt not the lady, when she sees"
31640,BOOK III.,"The wondrous deer amid the trees,"
31641,BOOK III.,Will bid her lord and Lakshman take
31642,BOOK III.,The creature for its beauty's sake.
31643,BOOK III.,"Then when the chiefs have parted thence,"
31644,BOOK III.,"And left her lone, without defence,"
31645,BOOK III.,"As Ráhu storms the moonlight, I"
31646,BOOK III.,Will seize the lovely dame and fly.
31647,BOOK III.,Her lord will waste away and weep
31648,BOOK III.,For her his valour could not keep.
31649,BOOK III.,Then boldly will I strike the blow
31650,BOOK III.,"And wreak my vengeance on the foe."""
31651,BOOK III.,
31652,BOOK III.,When wise Márícha heard the tale
31653,BOOK III.,"His heart grew faint, his cheek was pale,"
31654,BOOK III.,"He stared with open orbs, and tried"
31655,BOOK III.,"To moisten lips which terror dried,"
31656,BOOK III.,"And grief, like death, his bosom rent"
31657,BOOK III.,As on the king his look he bent.
31658,BOOK III.,"The monarch's will he strove to stay,"
31659,BOOK III.,"Distracted with alarm,"
31660,BOOK III.,For well he knew the might that lay
31661,BOOK III.,In Ráma's matchless arm.
31662,BOOK III.,With suppliant hands Márícha stood
31663,BOOK III.,And thus began to tell
31664,BOOK III.,"His counsel for the tyrant's good,"
31665,BOOK III.,And for his own as well:
31666,BOOK III.,
31667,BOOK III.,
31668,BOOK III.,
31669,BOOK III.,
31670,BOOK III.,Canto XXXVII. Márícha's Speech.
31671,BOOK III.,
31672,BOOK III.,
31673,BOOK III.,Márícha gave attentive ear
31674,BOOK III.,The ruler of the fiends to hear:
31675,BOOK III.,"Then, trained in all the rules that teach"
31676,BOOK III.,"The eloquent, began his speech:"
31677,BOOK III.,"""'Tis easy task, O King, to find"
31678,BOOK III.,Smooth speakers who delight the mind.
31679,BOOK III.,But they who urge and they who do
31680,BOOK III.,"Distasteful things and wise, are few."
31681,BOOK III.,"Thou hast not learnt, by proof untaught,"
31682,BOOK III.,"And borne away by eager thought,"
31683,BOOK III.,"That Ráma, formed for high emprise,"
31684,BOOK III.,With Varun or with Indra vies.
31685,BOOK III.,"Still let thy people live in peace,"
31686,BOOK III.,"Nor let their name and lineage cease,"
31687,BOOK III.,For Ráma with his vengeful hand
31688,BOOK III.,Can sweep the giants from the land.
31689,BOOK III.,"O, let not Janak's daughter bring"
31690,BOOK III.,Destruction on the giant king.
31691,BOOK III.,Let not the lady Sítá wake
31692,BOOK III.,"A tempest, on thy head to break."
31693,BOOK III.,"Still let the dame, by care untried,"
31694,BOOK III.,"Be happy by her husband's side,"
31695,BOOK III.,Lest swift avenging ruin fall
31696,BOOK III.,"On glorious Lanká, thee, and all."
31697,BOOK III.,"Men such as thou with wills unchained,"
31698,BOOK III.,"Advised by sin and unrestrained,"
31699,BOOK III.,"Destroy themselves, the king, the state,"
31700,BOOK III.,And leave the people desolate.
31701,BOOK III.,"Ráma, in bonds of duty held,"
31702,BOOK III.,Was never by his sire expelled.
31703,BOOK III.,"He is no wretch of greedy mind,"
31704,BOOK III.,Dishonour of his Warrior kind.
31705,BOOK III.,"Free from all touch of rancorous spite,"
31706,BOOK III.,All creatures' good is his delight.
31707,BOOK III.,He saw his sire of truthful heart
31708,BOOK III.,"Deceived by Queen Kaikeyí's art,"
31709,BOOK III.,"And said, a true and duteous son,"
31710,BOOK III.,"""What thou hast promised shall be done."""
31711,BOOK III.,"To gratify the lady's will,"
31712,BOOK III.,"His father's promise to fulfil,"
31713,BOOK III.,He left his realm and all delight
31714,BOOK III.,"For Dandak wood, an anchorite."
31715,BOOK III.,"No cruel wretch, no senseless fool"
31716,BOOK III.,"Is Ráma, unrestrained by rule."
31717,BOOK III.,"This groundless charge has ne'er been heard,"
31718,BOOK III.,Nor shouldst thou speak the slanderous word.
31719,BOOK III.,Ráma in truth and goodness bold
31720,BOOK III.,"Is Virtue's self in human mould,"
31721,BOOK III.,The sovereign of the world confessed
31722,BOOK III.,As Indra rules among the Blest.
31723,BOOK III.,And dost thou plot from him to rend
31724,BOOK III.,The darling whom his arms defend?
31725,BOOK III.,Less vain the hope to steal away
31726,BOOK III.,The glory of the Lord of Day.
31727,BOOK III.,"O Rávan, guard thee from the fire"
31728,BOOK III.,"Of vengeful Ráma's kindled ire,--"
31729,BOOK III.,"Each spark a shaft with deadly aim,"
31730,BOOK III.,While bow and falchion feed the flame.
31731,BOOK III.,Cast not away in hopeless strife
31732,BOOK III.,"Thy realm, thy bliss, thine own dear life."
31733,BOOK III.,"O Rávan of his might beware,"
31734,BOOK III.,A God of Death who will not spare.
31735,BOOK III.,That bow he knows so well to draw
31736,BOOK III.,"Is the destroyer's flaming jaw,"
31737,BOOK III.,And with his shafts which flash and glow
31738,BOOK III.,He slays the armies of the foe.
31739,BOOK III.,Thou ne'er canst win--the thought forego--
31740,BOOK III.,From the safe guard of shaft and bow
31741,BOOK III.,"King Janak's child, the dear delight"
31742,BOOK III.,Of Ráma unapproached in might.
31743,BOOK III.,"The spouse of Raghu's son, confessed"
31744,BOOK III.,"Lion of men with lion chest,--"
31745,BOOK III.,"Dearer than life, through good and ill"
31746,BOOK III.,"Devoted to her husband's will,"
31747,BOOK III.,"The slender-waisted, still must be"
31748,BOOK III.,From thy polluting touches free.
31749,BOOK III.,Far better grasp with venturous hand
31750,BOOK III.,The flame to wildest fury fanned.
31751,BOOK III.,"What, King of giants, canst thou gain"
31752,BOOK III.,From this attempt so wild and vain?
31753,BOOK III.,If in the fight his eye he bend
31754,BOOK III.,"Upon thee, Lord, thy days must end,"
31755,BOOK III.,"So life and bliss and royal sway,"
31756,BOOK III.,"Lost beyond hope, will pass away."
31757,BOOK III.,"Summon each lord of high estate,"
31758,BOOK III.,"And chief, Vibhishan(490) to debate."
31759,BOOK III.,With peers in lore of counsel tried
31760,BOOK III.,"Consider, reason, and decide"
31761,BOOK III.,"Scan strength and weakness, count the cost,"
31762,BOOK III.,What may be gained and what be lost.
31763,BOOK III.,Examine and compare aright
31764,BOOK III.,"Thy proper power and Ráma's might,"
31765,BOOK III.,"Then if thy weal be still thy care,"
31766,BOOK III.,Thou wilt be prudent and forbear.
31767,BOOK III.,"O giant King, the contest shun,"
31768,BOOK III.,Thy force is all too weak
31769,BOOK III.,The lord of Kosál's mighty son
31770,BOOK III.,In deadly fray to seek.
31771,BOOK III.,"King of the hosts that rove at night,"
31772,BOOK III.,O hear what I advise:

31782,BOOK III.,"""Once in my strength and vigour's pride"
31783,BOOK III.,"I roamed this earth from side to side,"
31784,BOOK III.,"And towering like a mountain's crest,"
31785,BOOK III.,A thousand Nágas'(491) might possessed.
31786,BOOK III.,Like some vast sable cloud I showed:
31787,BOOK III.,My golden armlets flashed and glowed.
31788,BOOK III.,"A crown I wore, an axe I swayed,"
31789,BOOK III.,And all I met were sore afraid.
31790,BOOK III.,I roved where Dandak wood is spread;
31791,BOOK III.,On flesh of slaughtered saints I fed.
31792,BOOK III.,"Then Visvámitra, sage revered,"
31793,BOOK III.,"Holy of heart, my fury feared."
31794,BOOK III.,To Dasaratha's court he sped
31795,BOOK III.,And went before the king and said:(492)
31796,BOOK III.,
31797,BOOK III.,"""With me, my lord, thy Ráma send"
31798,BOOK III.,On holy days his aid to lend.
31799,BOOK III.,Márícha fills my soul with dread
31800,BOOK III.,"And keeps me sore disquieted."""
31801,BOOK III.,
31802,BOOK III.,The monarch heard the saint's request
31803,BOOK III.,And thus the glorious sage addressed:
31804,BOOK III.,
31805,BOOK III.,"""My boy as yet in arms untrained"
31806,BOOK III.,The age of twelve has scarce attained.
31807,BOOK III.,But I myself a host will lead
31808,BOOK III.,To guard thee in the hour of need.
31809,BOOK III.,"My host with fourfold troops complete,"
31810,BOOK III.,"The rover of the night shall meet,"
31811,BOOK III.,"And I, O best of saints, will kill"
31812,BOOK III.,"Thy foeman and thy prayer fulfil."""
31813,BOOK III.,The king vouchsafed his willing aid:
31814,BOOK III.,The saint again this answer made:
31815,BOOK III.,
31816,BOOK III.,"""By Ráma's might, and his alone,"
31817,BOOK III.,Can this great fiend be overthrown.
31818,BOOK III.,I know in days of yore the Blest
31819,BOOK III.,Thy saving help in fight confessed.
31820,BOOK III.,Still of thy famous deeds they tell
31821,BOOK III.,"In heaven above, in earth, and hell,"
31822,BOOK III.,A mighty host obeys thy hest:
31823,BOOK III.,"Here let it still, I pray thee, rest."
31824,BOOK III.,"Thy glorious son, though yet a boy,"
31825,BOOK III.,Will in the fight that fiend destroy.
31826,BOOK III.,Ráma alone with me shall go:
31827,BOOK III.,"Be happy, victor of the foe."""
31828,BOOK III.,
31829,BOOK III.,"He spoke: the monarch gave assent,"
31830,BOOK III.,And Ráma to the hermit lent.
31831,BOOK III.,So to his woodland home in joy
31832,BOOK III.,Went Visvámitra with the boy.
31833,BOOK III.,With ready bow the champion stood
31834,BOOK III.,To guard the rites in Dandak wood.
31835,BOOK III.,"With glorious eyes, most bright to view,"
31836,BOOK III.,Beardless as yet and dark of hue;
31837,BOOK III.,"A single robe his only wear,"
31838,BOOK III.,"His temples veiled with waving hair,"
31839,BOOK III.,"Around his neck a chain of gold,"
31840,BOOK III.,He grasped the bow he loved to hold;
31841,BOOK III.,And the young hero's presence made
31842,BOOK III.,A glory in the forest shade.
31843,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma with his beauteous mien,"
31844,BOOK III.,"Like the young rising moon was seen,"
31845,BOOK III.,"I, like a cloud which tempest brings,"
31846,BOOK III.,"My arms adorned with golden rings,"
31847,BOOK III.,"Proud of the boon which lent me might,"
31848,BOOK III.,Approached where dwelt the anchorite.
31849,BOOK III.,"But Ráma saw me venturing nigh,"
31850,BOOK III.,Raising my murderous axe on high;
31851,BOOK III.,"He saw, and fearless of the foe,"
31852,BOOK III.,Strung with calm hand his trusty bow.
31853,BOOK III.,"By pride of conscious strength beguiled,"
31854,BOOK III.,"I scorned him as a feeble child,"
31855,BOOK III.,And rushed with an impetuous bound
31856,BOOK III.,On Visvámitra's holy ground.
31857,BOOK III.,"A keen swift shaft he pointed well,"
31858,BOOK III.,"The foeman's rage to check and quell,"
31859,BOOK III.,And hurled a hundred leagues away
31860,BOOK III.,Deep in the ocean waves I lay.
31861,BOOK III.,"He would not kill, but, nobly brave,"
31862,BOOK III.,My forfeit life he chose to save.
31863,BOOK III.,So there I lay with wandering sense
31864,BOOK III.,Dazed by that arrow's violence.
31865,BOOK III.,Long in the sea I lay: at length
31866,BOOK III.,"Slowly returned my sense and strength,"
31867,BOOK III.,And rising from my watery bed
31868,BOOK III.,To Lanká's town again I sped.
31869,BOOK III.,"Thus was I spared, but all my band"
31870,BOOK III.,"Fell slain by Ráma's conquering hand,--"
31871,BOOK III.,"A boy, untrained in warrior's skill,"
31872,BOOK III.,Of iron arm and dauntless will.
31873,BOOK III.,"If thou with Ráma still, in spite"
31874,BOOK III.,"Of warning and of prayer, wilt fight,"
31875,BOOK III.,"I see terrific woes impend,"
31876,BOOK III.,And dire defeat thy days will end.
31877,BOOK III.,Thy giants all will feel the blow
31878,BOOK III.,"And share the fatal overthrow,"
31879,BOOK III.,"Who love the taste of joy and play,"
31880,BOOK III.,The banquet and the festal day.
31881,BOOK III.,Thine eyes will see destruction take
31882,BOOK III.,"Thy Lanká, lost for Sítá's sake,"
31883,BOOK III.,And stately pile and palace fall
31884,BOOK III.,"With terrace, dome, and jewelled wall."
31885,BOOK III.,The good will die: the crime of kings
31886,BOOK III.,Destruction on the people brings:
31887,BOOK III.,"The sinless die, as in the lake"
31888,BOOK III.,The fish must perish with the snake.
31889,BOOK III.,The prostrate giants thou wilt see
31890,BOOK III.,"Slain for this folly wrought by thee,"
31891,BOOK III.,Their bodies bright with precious scent
31892,BOOK III.,And sheen of heavenly ornament;
31893,BOOK III.,Or see the remnant of thy train
31894,BOOK III.,"Seek refuge far, when help is vain"
31895,BOOK III.,"And with their wives, or widowed, fly"
31896,BOOK III.,To every quarter of the sky;
31897,BOOK III.,"Thy mournful eyes, where'er they turn,"
31898,BOOK III.,"Will see thy stately city burn,"
31899,BOOK III.,"When royal homes with fire are red,"
31900,BOOK III.,And arrowy nets around are spread.
31901,BOOK III.,A sin that tops all sins in shame
31902,BOOK III.,"Is outrage to another's dame,"
31903,BOOK III.,"A thousand wives thy palace fill,"
31904,BOOK III.,And countless beauties wait thy will.

31912,BOOK III.,Nor challenge Ráma to the fray.
31913,BOOK III.,"If deaf to every friendly prayer,"
31914,BOOK III.,"Thou still wilt seek the strife,"
31915,BOOK III.,And from the side of Ráma tear
31916,BOOK III.,"His lovely Maithil wife,"
31917,BOOK III.,Soon will thy life and empire end
31918,BOOK III.,"Destroyed by Ráma's bow,"

31932,BOOK III.,"At length, restored to strength and pride,"
31933,BOOK III.,I and two mighty fiends beside
31934,BOOK III.,Assumed the forms of deer and strayed
31935,BOOK III.,"Through Dandak wood in lawn and glade,"
31936,BOOK III.,I reared terrific horns: beneath
31937,BOOK III.,Were flaming tongue and pointed teeth.
31938,BOOK III.,"I roamed where'er my fancy led,"
31939,BOOK III.,"And on the flesh of hermits fed,"
31940,BOOK III.,"In sacred haunt, by hallowed tree,"
31941,BOOK III.,Where'er the ritual fires might be.
31942,BOOK III.,"A fearful shape, I wandered through"
31943,BOOK III.,"The wood, and many a hermit slew."
31944,BOOK III.,With ruthless rage the saints I killed
31945,BOOK III.,Who in the grove their tasks fulfilled.
31946,BOOK III.,"When smitten to the earth they sank,"
31947,BOOK III.,"Their flesh I ate, their blood I drank,"
31948,BOOK III.,And with my cruel deeds dismayed
31949,BOOK III.,"All dwellers in the forest shade,"
31950,BOOK III.,"Spoiling their rites in bitter hate,"
31951,BOOK III.,With human blood inebriate.
31952,BOOK III.,Once in the wood I chanced to see
31953,BOOK III.,"Ráma again, a devotee,"
31954,BOOK III.,"A hermit, fed on scanty fare,"
31955,BOOK III.,Who made the good of all his care.
31956,BOOK III.,"His noble wife was by his side,"
31957,BOOK III.,And Lakshman in the battle tried.
31958,BOOK III.,In senseless pride I scorned the might
31959,BOOK III.,"Of that illustrious anchorite,"
31960,BOOK III.,"And heedless of a hermit foe,"
31961,BOOK III.,Recalled my earlier overthrow.
31962,BOOK III.,I charged him in my rage and scorn
31963,BOOK III.,"To slay him with my pointed horn,"
31964,BOOK III.,"In heedless haste, to fury wrought"
31965,BOOK III.,As on my former wounds I thought.
31966,BOOK III.,Then from the mighty bow he drew
31967,BOOK III.,"Three foe-destroying arrows flew,"
31968,BOOK III.,"Keen-pointed, leaping from the string,"
31969,BOOK III.,Swift as the wind or feathered king.
31970,BOOK III.,"Dire shafts, on flesh of foemen fed,"

31978,BOOK III.,"I fled from mortal danger, freed"
31979,BOOK III.,From the dire shaft by timely speed.
31980,BOOK III.,"Now to deep thought my days I give,"

32011,BOOK III.,"In deepest thought, most innocent,"
32012,BOOK III.,With all their people many a time

32018,BOOK III.,"For he, in might supremely great,"

32022,BOOK III.,"For Súrpanakhá's sake, he died"

32039,BOOK III.,
32040,BOOK III.,
32041,BOOK III.,But Rávan scorned the rede he gave
32042,BOOK III.,"In timely words to warn and save,"
32043,BOOK III.,E'en as the wretch who hates to live
32044,BOOK III.,Rejects the herb the leeches give.
32045,BOOK III.,"By fate to sin and ruin spurred,"
32046,BOOK III.,"That sage advice the giant heard,"
32047,BOOK III.,Then in reproaches hard and stern
32048,BOOK III.,Thus to Márícha spoke in turn:
32049,BOOK III.,
32050,BOOK III.,"""Is this thy counsel, weak and base,"
32051,BOOK III.,Unworthy of thy giant race?
32052,BOOK III.,"Thy speech is fruitless, vain, thy toil"
32053,BOOK III.,Like casting seed on barren soil.
32054,BOOK III.,No words of thine shall drive me back
32055,BOOK III.,From Ráma and the swift attack.
32056,BOOK III.,"A fool is he, inured to sin,"
32057,BOOK III.,"And more, of human origin."
32058,BOOK III.,"The craven, at a woman's call"
32059,BOOK III.,"To leave his sire, his mother, all"
32060,BOOK III.,"The friends he loved, the power and sway,"
32061,BOOK III.,And hasten to the woods away!
32062,BOOK III.,"But now his anger will I rouse,"
32063,BOOK III.,Stealing away his darling spouse.
32064,BOOK III.,I in thy sight will ravish her
32065,BOOK III.,From Khara's cruel murderer.
32066,BOOK III.,"Upon this plan my soul is bent,"
32067,BOOK III.,"And naught shall move my firm intent,"
32068,BOOK III.,Not if the way through demons led
32069,BOOK III.,And Gods with Indra at their head.
32070,BOOK III.,"'Tis thine, when questioned, to explain"
32071,BOOK III.,"The hope and fear, the loss and gain,"
32072,BOOK III.,"And, when thy king thy thoughts would know,"
32073,BOOK III.,The triumph or the danger show.
32074,BOOK III.,"A prudent counsellor should wait,"
32075,BOOK III.,"And speak when ordered in debate,"
32076,BOOK III.,"With hands uplifted, calm and meek,"
32077,BOOK III.,If honour and reward he seek.
32078,BOOK III.,"Or, when some prudent course he sees"
32079,BOOK III.,"Which, spoken, may his king displease"
32080,BOOK III.,He should by hints of dexterous art
32081,BOOK III.,His counsel to his lord impart.
32082,BOOK III.,But prudent words are said in vain
32083,BOOK III.,When the blunt speech brings grief and pain.
32084,BOOK III.,A high-souled king will scarcely thank
32085,BOOK III.,The man who shames his royal rank.
32086,BOOK III.,"Five are the shapes that kings assume,"
32087,BOOK III.,"Of majesty, of grace, and gloom:"
32088,BOOK III.,"Like Indra now, or Agni, now"
32089,BOOK III.,"Like the dear Moon, with placid brow:"
32090,BOOK III.,"Like mighty Varun now they show,"
32091,BOOK III.,Now fierce as He who rules below.
32092,BOOK III.,"O giant, monarchs lofty-souled"
32093,BOOK III.,"Are kind and gentle, stern and bold,"
32094,BOOK III.,With gracious love their gifts dispense
32095,BOOK III.,And swiftly punish each offence.
32096,BOOK III.,Thus subjects should their rulers view
32097,BOOK III.,With all respect and honour due.
32098,BOOK III.,But folly leads thy heart to slight
32099,BOOK III.,Thy monarch and neglect his right.
32100,BOOK III.,Thou hast in lawless pride addressed
32101,BOOK III.,With bitter words thy royal guest.
32102,BOOK III.,"I asked thee not my strength to scan,"
32103,BOOK III.,Or loss and profit in the plan.
32104,BOOK III.,I only spoke to tell the deed
32105,BOOK III.,"O mighty one, by me decreed,"
32106,BOOK III.,And bid thee in the peril lend
32107,BOOK III.,Thy succour to support thy friend.
32108,BOOK III.,"Hear me again, and I will tell"
32109,BOOK III.,How thou canst aid my venture well.
32110,BOOK III.,In semblance of a golden deer
32111,BOOK III.,"Adorned with silver drops, appear:"
32112,BOOK III.,And near the cottage in the way
32113,BOOK III.,Of Ráma and his consort stray.
32114,BOOK III.,"Draw nigh, and wandering through the brake"
32115,BOOK III.,With thy strange form her fancy take.
32116,BOOK III.,The Maithil dame with wondering eyes
32117,BOOK III.,"Will took upon thy fair disguise,"
32118,BOOK III.,And quickly bid her husband go
32119,BOOK III.,"And bring the deer that charms her so,"
32120,BOOK III.,"When Raghu's son has left the place,"
32121,BOOK III.,"Still pressing onward in the chase,"
32122,BOOK III.,"Cry out, ""O Lakshman! Ah, mine own!"""
32123,BOOK III.,With voice resembling Ráma's tone.
32124,BOOK III.,"When Lakshman hears his brother's cry,"
32125,BOOK III.,"Impelled by Sítá he will fly,"
32126,BOOK III.,"Restless with eager love, to aid"
32127,BOOK III.,The hunter in the distant shade.
32128,BOOK III.,"When both her guards have left her side,"
32129,BOOK III.,"Even as Indra, thousand-eyed,"
32130,BOOK III.,"Clasps Sachí, will I bear away"
32131,BOOK III.,The Maithil dame an easy prey.
32132,BOOK III.,"When thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,"
32133,BOOK III.,Go where thou wilt and live content.
32134,BOOK III.,"True servant, faithful to thy vow,"
32135,BOOK III.,With half my realm I thee endow.
32136,BOOK III.,"Go forth, may luck thy way attend"
32137,BOOK III.,That leads thee to the happy end.
32138,BOOK III.,I in my car will quickly be
32139,BOOK III.,"In Dandak wood, and follow thee."
32140,BOOK III.,So will I cheat this Ráma's eyes
32141,BOOK III.,And win without a blow the prize;
32142,BOOK III.,And safe return to Lanká's town
32143,BOOK III.,"With thee, my friend, this day shall crown."
32144,BOOK III.,"But if thou wilt not aid my will,"
32145,BOOK III.,My hand this day thy blood shall spill.
32146,BOOK III.,"Yea, thou must share the destined task,"
32147,BOOK III.,For force will take the help I ask.
32148,BOOK III.,No bliss that rebel's life attends
32149,BOOK III.,Whose stubborn will his lord offends.
32150,BOOK III.,"Thy life, if thou the task assay,"
32151,BOOK III.,In jeopardy may stand;
32152,BOOK III.,"Oppose me, and this very day"
32153,BOOK III.,Thou diest by this hand.
32154,BOOK III.,Now ponder all that thou hast heard
32155,BOOK III.,Within thy prudent breast:

32163,BOOK III.,
32164,BOOK III.,
32165,BOOK III.,Against his judgment sorely pressed
32166,BOOK III.,"By his imperious lord's behest,"
32167,BOOK III.,Márícha threats of death defied
32168,BOOK III.,And thus with bitter words replied:
32169,BOOK III.,"""Ah, who, my King, with sinful thought"
32170,BOOK III.,"This wild and wicked counsel taught,"
32171,BOOK III.,By which destruction soon will fall
32172,BOOK III.,"On thee, thy sons, thy realm and all?"
32173,BOOK III.,Who is the guilty wretch who sees
32174,BOOK III.,"With envious eye thy blissful ease,"
32175,BOOK III.,"And by this plan, so falsely shown,"
32176,BOOK III.,Death's gate for thee has open thrown?
32177,BOOK III.,With souls impelled by mean desire
32178,BOOK III.,Thy foes against thy life conspire.
32179,BOOK III.,"They urge thee to destruction's brink,"
32180,BOOK III.,And gladly would they see thee sink.
32181,BOOK III.,Who with base thought to work thee woe
32182,BOOK III.,"This fatal road has dared to show,"
32183,BOOK III.,"And, triumph in his wicked eye,"
32184,BOOK III.,Would see thee enter in and die?
32185,BOOK III.,"To all thy counsellors, untrue,"
32186,BOOK III.,"The punishment of death is due,"
32187,BOOK III.,"Who see thee tempt the dangerous way,"
32188,BOOK III.,Nor strain each nerve thy foot to stay.
32189,BOOK III.,"Wise lords, whose king, by passion led,"
32190,BOOK III.,"The path of sin begins to tread,"
32191,BOOK III.,Restrain him while there yet is time:
32192,BOOK III.,"But thine,--they see nor heed the crime."
32193,BOOK III.,These by their master's will obtain
32194,BOOK III.,Merit and fame and joy and gain.
32195,BOOK III.,'Tis only by their master's grace
32196,BOOK III.,That servants hold their lofty place.
32197,BOOK III.,But when the monarch stoops to sin
32198,BOOK III.,"They lose each joy they strive to win,"
32199,BOOK III.,And all the people people high and low
32200,BOOK III.,Fall in the common overthrow.
32201,BOOK III.,"Merit and fame and honour spring,"
32202,BOOK III.,"Best of the mighty, from the king."
32203,BOOK III.,So all should strive with heart and will
32204,BOOK III.,To keep the king from every ill.
32205,BOOK III.,"Pride, violence, and sullen hate"
32206,BOOK III.,"Will ne'er maintain a monarch's state,"
32207,BOOK III.,And those who cruel deeds advise
32208,BOOK III.,"Must perish when their master dies,"
32209,BOOK III.,Like drivers with their cars o'erthrown
32210,BOOK III.,In places rough with root and stone.
32211,BOOK III.,The good whose holy lives were spent
32212,BOOK III.,"On duty's highest laws intent,"
32213,BOOK III.,With wives and children many a time
32214,BOOK III.,Have perished for another's crime.
32215,BOOK III.,"Hapless are they whose sovereign lord,"
32216,BOOK III.,"Opposed to all, by all abhorred,"

32219,BOOK III.,"Now all the giant race await,"
32220,BOOK III.,"Destroyed by thee, a speedy fate,"
32221,BOOK III.,"Ruled by a king so cruel-souled,"
32222,BOOK III.,Foolish in heart and uncontrolled.
32223,BOOK III.,Think not I fear the sudden blow
32224,BOOK III.,That threatens now to lay me low:

32227,BOOK III.,"Me first perchance will Ráma kill,"
32228,BOOK III.,But soon his hand thy blood will spill.

32231,BOOK III.,Soon as the hero's face I see

32233,BOOK III.,And if on her thy hands thou lay

32258,BOOK III.,"""Ah, I have met that mighty lord"
32259,BOOK III.,"Armed with his shafts and bow and sword,"
32260,BOOK III.,And if again that bow he bend
32261,BOOK III.,Our lives that very hour will end.
32262,BOOK III.,For none that warrior can provoke
32263,BOOK III.,And think to fly his deadly stroke.
32264,BOOK III.,"Like Yáma with his staff is he,"
32265,BOOK III.,And his dread hand will slaughter thee.
32266,BOOK III.,What can I more? My words can find

32268,BOOK III.,"I go, great King, thy task to share,"
32269,BOOK III.,"And may success attend thee there."""
32270,BOOK III.,
32271,BOOK III.,With that reply and bold consent
32272,BOOK III.,The giant king was well content.
32273,BOOK III.,He strained Márícha to his breast
32274,BOOK III.,And thus with joyful words addressed:
32275,BOOK III.,"""There spoke a hero dauntless still,"
32276,BOOK III.,"Obedient to his master's will,"
32277,BOOK III.,Márícha's proper self once more:
32278,BOOK III.,Some other took thy shape before.
32279,BOOK III.,"Come, mount my jewelled car that flies."
32280,BOOK III.,"Will-governed, through the yielding skies."
32281,BOOK III.,"These asses, goblin-faced, shall bear"
32282,BOOK III.,Us quickly through the fields of air.
32283,BOOK III.,"Attract the lady with thy shape,"
32284,BOOK III.,"Then through the wood, at will, escape."
32285,BOOK III.,"And I, when she has no defence,"
32286,BOOK III.,"Will seize the dame and bear her thence."""
32287,BOOK III.,
32288,BOOK III.,"Again Márícha made reply,"
32289,BOOK III.,Consent and will to signify.
32290,BOOK III.,With rapid speed the giants two
32291,BOOK III.,"From the calm hermit dwelling flew,"
32292,BOOK III.,"Borne in that wondrous chariot, meet"
32293,BOOK III.,For some great God's celestial seat.
32294,BOOK III.,They from their airy path looked down
32295,BOOK III.,"On many a wood and many a town,"
32296,BOOK III.,"On lake and river, brook and rill,"
32297,BOOK III.,City and realm and towering hill.
32298,BOOK III.,"Soon he whom giant hosts obeyed,"
32299,BOOK III.,"Márícha by his side, surveyed"
32300,BOOK III.,The dark expanse of Dandak wood
32301,BOOK III.,Where Ráma's hermit cottage stood.
32302,BOOK III.,"They left the flying car, whereon"
32303,BOOK III.,"The wealth of gold and jewels shone,"
32304,BOOK III.,And thus the giant king addressed
32305,BOOK III.,Márícha as his hand he pressed:
32306,BOOK III.,
32307,BOOK III.,"""Márícha, look! before our eyes"
32308,BOOK III.,Round Ráma's home the plantains rise.
32309,BOOK III.,His hermitage is now in view:
32310,BOOK III.,"Quick to the work we came to do!"""
32311,BOOK III.,
32312,BOOK III.,"Thus Rávan spoke, Márícha heard"
32313,BOOK III.,"Obedient to his master's word,"
32314,BOOK III.,Threw off his giant shape and near
32315,BOOK III.,The cottage strayed a beauteous deer.
32316,BOOK III.,"With magic power, by rapid change,"
32317,BOOK III.,His borrowed form was fair and strange.
32318,BOOK III.,A sapphire tipped each horn with light;
32319,BOOK III.,His face was black relieved with white.
32320,BOOK III.,The turkis and the ruby shed
32321,BOOK III.,A glory from his ears and head.
32322,BOOK III.,"His arching neck was proudly raised,"
32323,BOOK III.,And lazulites beneath it blazed.
32324,BOOK III.,"With roseate bloom his flanks were dyed,"
32325,BOOK III.,And lotus tints adorned his hide.
32326,BOOK III.,"His shape was fair, compact, and slight;"
32327,BOOK III.,His hoofs were carven lazulite.
32328,BOOK III.,His tail with every changing glow
32329,BOOK III.,Displayed the hues of Indra's bow.
32330,BOOK III.,"With glossy skin so strangely flecked,"
32331,BOOK III.,With tints of every gem bedecked.
32332,BOOK III.,"A light o'er Ráma's home he sent,"
32333,BOOK III.,"And through the wood, where'er he went."
32334,BOOK III.,The giant clad in that strange dress
32335,BOOK III.,"That took the soul with loveliness,"
32336,BOOK III.,To charm the fair Videhan's eyes
32337,BOOK III.,"With mingled wealth of mineral dyes,"
32338,BOOK III.,"Moved onward, cropping in his way,"
32339,BOOK III.,The grass and grain and tender spray.
32340,BOOK III.,"His coat with drops of silver bright,"
32341,BOOK III.,"A form to gaze on with delight,"
32342,BOOK III.,He raised his fair neck as he went
32343,BOOK III.,To browse on bud and filament.
32344,BOOK III.,"Now in the Cassia grove he strayed,"
32345,BOOK III.,Now by the cot in plantains' shade.
32346,BOOK III.,Slowly and slowly on he came
32347,BOOK III.,"To catch the glances of the dame,"
32348,BOOK III.,And the tall deer of splendid hue
32349,BOOK III.,Shone full at length in Sítá's view.
32350,BOOK III.,He roamed where'er his fancy chose
32351,BOOK III.,Where Ráma's leafy cottage rose.
32352,BOOK III.,"Now near, now far, in careless ease,"
32353,BOOK III.,He came and went among the trees.
32354,BOOK III.,"Now with light feet he turned to fly,"
32355,BOOK III.,"Now, reassured, again drew nigh:"
32356,BOOK III.,"Now gambolled close with leap and bound,"
32357,BOOK III.,Now lay upon the grassy ground:
32358,BOOK III.,"Now sought the door, devoid of fear,"
32359,BOOK III.,And mingled with the troop of deer;
32360,BOOK III.,"Led them a little way, and thence"
32361,BOOK III.,Again returned with confidence.
32362,BOOK III.,"Now flying far, now turning back"
32363,BOOK III.,"Emboldened on his former track,"
32364,BOOK III.,Seeking to win the lady's glance
32365,BOOK III.,He wandered through the green expanse.
32366,BOOK III.,"Then thronging round, the woodland deer"
32367,BOOK III.,Gazed on his form with wondering fear;
32368,BOOK III.,"A while they followed where he led,"
32369,BOOK III.,Then snuffed the tainted gale and fled.
32370,BOOK III.,"The giant, though he longed to slay"
32371,BOOK III.,"The startled quarry, spared the prey,"
32372,BOOK III.,And mindful of the shape he wore
32373,BOOK III.,"To veil his nature, still forbore."
32374,BOOK III.,"Then Sítá of the glorious eye,"
32375,BOOK III.,Returning from her task drew nigh;
32376,BOOK III.,For she had sought the wood to bring
32377,BOOK III.,Each loveliest flower of early spring.
32378,BOOK III.,Now would the bright-eyed lady choose
32379,BOOK III.,"Some gorgeous bud with blending hues,"
32380,BOOK III.,"Now plucked the mango's spray, and now"
32381,BOOK III.,The bloom from an Asoka bough.
32382,BOOK III.,"She with her beauteous form, unmeet"
32383,BOOK III.,"For woodland life and lone retreat,"
32384,BOOK III.,That wondrous dappled deer beheld
32385,BOOK III.,"Gemmed with rich pearls, unparalleled,"
32386,BOOK III.,"His silver hair the lady saw,"
32387,BOOK III.,"His radiant teeth and lips and jaw,"
32388,BOOK III.,And gazed with rapture as her eyes
32389,BOOK III.,Expanded in their glad surprise.
32390,BOOK III.,And when the false deer's glances fell
32391,BOOK III.,"On her whom Ráma loved so well,"
32392,BOOK III.,"He wandered here and there, and cast"
32393,BOOK III.,A luminous beauty as he passed;
32394,BOOK III.,And Janak's child with strange delight

32407,BOOK III.,"Joyous was she of faultless mould,"
32408,BOOK III.,With glossy skin like polished gold.

32419,BOOK III.,"But doubt was strong in Lakshman's breast,"
32420,BOOK III.,Who thus his thought and fear expressed:
32421,BOOK III.,
32422,BOOK III.,"""Stay, for the wondrous deer we see"
32423,BOOK III.,The fiend Márícha's self may be.
32424,BOOK III.,Ere now have kings who sought this place
32425,BOOK III.,"To take their pastime in the chase,"
32426,BOOK III.,"Met from his wicked art defeat,"
32427,BOOK III.,And fallen slain by like deceit.
32428,BOOK III.,"He wears, well trained in magic guile,"
32429,BOOK III.,"The figure of a deer a while,"
32430,BOOK III.,"Bright as the very sun, or place"
32431,BOOK III.,Where dwell the gay Gandharva race.
32432,BOOK III.,"No deer, O Ráma, e'er was seen"
32433,BOOK III.,Thus decked with gold and jewels' sheen.
32434,BOOK III.,"'Tis magic, for the world has ne'er,"
32435,BOOK III.,"Lord of the world, shown aught so fair."""
32436,BOOK III.,
32437,BOOK III.,"But Sítá of the lovely smile,"
32438,BOOK III.,"A captive to the giant's wile,"
32439,BOOK III.,Turned Lakshman's prudent speech aside
32440,BOOK III.,And thus with eager words replied:
32441,BOOK III.,"""My honoured lord, this deer I see"
32442,BOOK III.,With beauty rare enraptures me.
32443,BOOK III.,"Go, chief of mighty arm, and bring"
32444,BOOK III.,For my delight this precious thing.
32445,BOOK III.,Fair creatures of the woodland roam
32446,BOOK III.,Untroubled near our hermit home.
32447,BOOK III.,"The forest cow and stag are there,"
32448,BOOK III.,"The fawn, the monkey, and the bear,"
32449,BOOK III.,"Where spotted deer delight to play,"
32450,BOOK III.,And strong and beauteous Kinnars(494) stray.
32451,BOOK III.,"But never, as they wandered by,"
32452,BOOK III.,Has such a beauty charmed mine eye
32453,BOOK III.,"As this with limbs so fair and slight,"
32454,BOOK III.,"So gentle, beautiful and bright."
32455,BOOK III.,"O see, how fair it is to view"
32456,BOOK III.,With jewels of each varied hue:
32457,BOOK III.,"Bright as the rising moon it glows,"
32458,BOOK III.,Lighting the wood where'er it goes.
32459,BOOK III.,"Ah me, what form and grace are there!"
32460,BOOK III.,"Its limbs how fine, its hues how fair!"
32461,BOOK III.,"Transcending all that words express,"
32462,BOOK III.,It takes my soul with loveliness.
32463,BOOK III.,"O, if thou would, to please me, strive"
32464,BOOK III.,"To take the beauteous thing alive,"
32465,BOOK III.,How thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes
32466,BOOK III.,Delighted on the lovely prize!
32467,BOOK III.,"And when our woodland life is o'er,"
32468,BOOK III.,"And we enjoy our realm once more,"
32469,BOOK III.,The wondrous animal will grace
32470,BOOK III.,"The chambers of my dwelling-place,"
32471,BOOK III.,And a dear treasure will it be
32472,BOOK III.,"To Bharat and the queens and me,"
32473,BOOK III.,And all with rapture and amaze
32474,BOOK III.,Upon its heavenly form will gaze.
32475,BOOK III.,"But if the beauteous deer, pursued,"
32476,BOOK III.,"Thine arts to take it still elude,"
32477,BOOK III.,"Strike it, O chieftain, and the skin"
32478,BOOK III.,"Will be a treasure, laid within."
32479,BOOK III.,"O, how I long my time to pass"
32480,BOOK III.,"Sitting upon the tender grass,"
32481,BOOK III.,With that soft fell beneath me spread
32482,BOOK III.,Bright with its hair of golden thread!
32483,BOOK III.,"This strong desire, this eager will,"
32484,BOOK III.,Befits a gentle lady ill:
32485,BOOK III.,"But when I first beheld, its look"
32486,BOOK III.,My breast with fascination took.
32487,BOOK III.,"See, golden hair its flank adorns,"
32488,BOOK III.,And sapphires tip its branching horns.
32489,BOOK III.,"Resplendent as the lunar way,"
32490,BOOK III.,"Or the first blush of opening day,"
32491,BOOK III.,With graceful form and radiant hue
32492,BOOK III.,"It charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too."""
32493,BOOK III.,
32494,BOOK III.,"He heard her speech with willing ear,"
32495,BOOK III.,He looked again upon the deer.
32496,BOOK III.,Its lovely shape his breast beguiled
32497,BOOK III.,"Moved by the prayer of Janak's child,"
32498,BOOK III.,"And yielding for her pleasure's sake,"
32499,BOOK III.,To Lakshman Ráma turned and spake:
32500,BOOK III.,
32501,BOOK III.,"""Mark, Lakshman, mark how Sítá's breast"
32502,BOOK III.,With eager longing is possessed.
32503,BOOK III.,To-day this deer of wondrous breed
32504,BOOK III.,"Must for his passing beauty bleed,"
32505,BOOK III.,"Brighter than e'er in Nandan strayed,"
32506,BOOK III.,Or Chaitraratha's heavenly shade.
32507,BOOK III.,How should the groves of earth possess
32508,BOOK III.,Such all-surpassing loveliness!
32509,BOOK III.,"The hair lies smooth and bright and fine,"
32510,BOOK III.,"Or waves upon each curving line,"
32511,BOOK III.,And drops of living gold bedeck
32512,BOOK III.,The beauty of his side and neck.
32513,BOOK III.,"O look, his crimson tongue between"
32514,BOOK III.,"His teeth like flaming fire is seen,"
32515,BOOK III.,"Flashing, whene'er his lips he parts,"
32516,BOOK III.,As from a cloud the lightning darts.
32517,BOOK III.,O see his sunlike forehead shine
32518,BOOK III.,"With emerald tints and almandine,"
32519,BOOK III.,While pearly light and roseate glow
32520,BOOK III.,Of shells adorn his neck below.
32521,BOOK III.,No eye on such a deer can rest
32522,BOOK III.,But soft enchantment takes the breast:
32523,BOOK III.,No man so fair a thing behold
32524,BOOK III.,"Ablaze with light of radiant gold,"
32525,BOOK III.,"Celestial, bright with jewels' sheen,"
32526,BOOK III.,Nor marvel when his eyes have seen.
32527,BOOK III.,A king equipped with bow and shaft
32528,BOOK III.,"Delights in gentle forest craft,"
32529,BOOK III.,And as in boundless woods he strays
32530,BOOK III.,The quarry for the venison slays.
32531,BOOK III.,There as he wanders with his train
32532,BOOK III.,A store of wealth he oft may gain.
32533,BOOK III.,"He claims by right the precious ore,"
32534,BOOK III.,He claims the jewels' sparkling store.
32535,BOOK III.,Such gains are dearer in his eyes
32536,BOOK III.,"Than wealth that in his chamber lies,"
32537,BOOK III.,"The dearest things his spirit knows,"
32538,BOOK III.,Dear as the bliss which Sukra chose.
32539,BOOK III.,But oft the rich expected gain
32540,BOOK III.,"Which heedless men pursue in vain,"
32541,BOOK III.,"The sage, who prudent counsels know,"
32542,BOOK III.,Explain and in a moment show.
32543,BOOK III.,"This best of deer, this gem of all,"
32544,BOOK III.,"To yield his precious spoils must fall,"
32545,BOOK III.,And tender Sítá by my side
32546,BOOK III.,Shall sit upon the golden hide.
32547,BOOK III.,Ne'er could I find so rich a coat
32548,BOOK III.,On spotted deer or sheep or goat.
32549,BOOK III.,"No buck or antelope has such,"
32550,BOOK III.,"So bright to view, so soft to touch."
32551,BOOK III.,This radiant deer and one on high
32552,BOOK III.,"That moves in glory through the sky,"
32553,BOOK III.,"Alike in heavenly beauty are,"
32554,BOOK III.,One on the earth and one a star.
32555,BOOK III.,"But, brother, if thy fears be true,"
32556,BOOK III.,And this bright creature that we view
32557,BOOK III.,"Be fierce Márícha in disguise,"
32558,BOOK III.,Then by this hand he surely dies.
32559,BOOK III.,For that dire fiend who spurns control
32560,BOOK III.,"With bloody hand and cruel soul,"
32561,BOOK III.,Has roamed this forest and dismayed
32562,BOOK III.,The holiest saints who haunt the shade.
32563,BOOK III.,"Great archers, sprung of royal race,"
32564,BOOK III.,"Pursuing in the wood the chase,"
32565,BOOK III.,"Have fallen by his wicked art,"
32566,BOOK III.,And now my shaft shall strike his heart.
32567,BOOK III.,"Vatápi, by his magic power"
32568,BOOK III.,"Made heedless saints his flesh devour,"
32569,BOOK III.,"Then, from within their frames he rent"
32570,BOOK III.,Forth bursting from imprisonment.
32571,BOOK III.,But once his art in senseless pride
32572,BOOK III.,"Upon the mightiest saint he tried,"
32573,BOOK III.,"Agastya's self, and caused him taste"
32574,BOOK III.,The baited meal before him placed.
32575,BOOK III.,"Vátápi, when the rite was o'er,"
32576,BOOK III.,"Would take the giant form he wore,"
32577,BOOK III.,But Saint Agastya knew his wile
32578,BOOK III.,And checked the giant with smile.
32579,BOOK III.,"""Vátápi, thou with cruel spite"
32580,BOOK III.,Hast conquered many an anchorite
32581,BOOK III.,"The noblest of the Bráhman caste,--"
32582,BOOK III.,"And now thy ruin comes at last."""
32583,BOOK III.,"Now if my power he thus defies,"
32584,BOOK III.,"This giant, like Vátápi dies,"
32585,BOOK III.,"Daring to scorn a man like me,"
32586,BOOK III.,A self subduing devotee.
32587,BOOK III.,"Yea, as Agastya slew the foe,"
32588,BOOK III.,My hand shall lay Márícha low
32589,BOOK III.,"Clad in thine arms thy bow in hand,"
32590,BOOK III.,"To guard the Maithil lady stand,"
32591,BOOK III.,With watchful eye and thoughtful breast
32592,BOOK III.,Keeping each word of my behest
32593,BOOK III.,"I go, and hunting through the brake"
32594,BOOK III.,This wondrous deer will bring or take.
32595,BOOK III.,Yea surely I will bring the spoil
32596,BOOK III.,Returning from my hunter's toil
32597,BOOK III.,"See, Lakshman how my consort's eyes"
32598,BOOK III.,Are longing for the lovely prize.
32599,BOOK III.,"This day it falls, that I may win"
32600,BOOK III.,The treasure of so fair a skin.
32601,BOOK III.,Do thou and Sítá watch with care
32602,BOOK III.,Lest danger seize you unaware.
32603,BOOK III.,Swift from my bow one shaft will fly;
32604,BOOK III.,The stricken deer will fall and die
32605,BOOK III.,Then quickly will I strip the game
32606,BOOK III.,And bring the trophy to my dame.
32607,BOOK III.,"Jatáyus, guardian good and wise,"
32608,BOOK III.,"Our old and faithful friend,"

32622,BOOK III.,Thus having warned his brother bold
32623,BOOK III.,"He grasped his sword with haft of gold,"

32625,BOOK III.,His own delight and ornament;
32626,BOOK III.,"Then bound two quivers to his side,"
32627,BOOK III.,And hurried forth with eager stride.
32628,BOOK III.,Soon as the antlered monarch saw
32629,BOOK III.,"The lord of monarchs near him draw,"
32630,BOOK III.,"A while with trembling heart he fled,"
32631,BOOK III.,Then turned and showed his stately head.
32632,BOOK III.,With sword and bow the chief pursued
32633,BOOK III.,Where'er the fleeing deer he viewed
32634,BOOK III.,Sending from dell and lone recess
32635,BOOK III.,The splendour of his loveliness.
32636,BOOK III.,Now full in view the creature stood
32637,BOOK III.,Now vanished in the depth of wood;
32638,BOOK III.,"Now running with a languid flight,"
32639,BOOK III.,Now like a meteor lost to sight.
32640,BOOK III.,With trembling limbs away he sped;
32641,BOOK III.,Then like the moon with clouds o'erspread
32642,BOOK III.,Gleamed for a moment bright between
32643,BOOK III.,"The trees, and was again unseen."
32644,BOOK III.,Thus in the magic deer's disguise
32645,BOOK III.,"Márícha lured him to the prize,"
32646,BOOK III.,"And seen a while, then lost to view,"
32647,BOOK III.,Far from his cot the hero drew.
32648,BOOK III.,Still by the flying game deceived
32649,BOOK III.,"The hunter's heart was wroth and grieved,"
32650,BOOK III.,And wearied with the fruitless chase
32651,BOOK III.,He stayed him in a shady place.
32652,BOOK III.,Again the rover of the night
32653,BOOK III.,"Enraged the chieftain, full in sight,"
32654,BOOK III.,"Slow moving in the coppice near,"
32655,BOOK III.,Surrounded by the woodland deer.
32656,BOOK III.,Again the hunter sought the game
32657,BOOK III.,That seemed a while to court his aim:
32658,BOOK III.,"But seized again with sudden dread,"
32659,BOOK III.,Beyond his sight the creature fled.
32660,BOOK III.,"Again the hero left the shade,"
32661,BOOK III.,Again the deer before him strayed.
32662,BOOK III.,With surer hope and stronger will
32663,BOOK III.,The hunter longed his prey to kill.
32664,BOOK III.,"Then as his soul impatient grew,"
32665,BOOK III.,"An arrow from his side he drew,"
32666,BOOK III.,"Resplendent at the sunbeam's glow,"
32667,BOOK III.,The crusher of the smitten foe.
32668,BOOK III.,With skillful heed the mighty lord
32669,BOOK III.,Fixed well shaft and strained the cord.
32670,BOOK III.,"Upon the deer his eyes he bent,"
32671,BOOK III.,And like a fiery serpent went
32672,BOOK III.,"The arrow Brahma's self had framed,"
32673,BOOK III.,"Alive with sparks that hissed and flamed,"
32674,BOOK III.,"Like Indra's flashing levin, true"
32675,BOOK III.,To the false deer the missile flew
32676,BOOK III.,Cleaving his flesh that wonderous dart
32677,BOOK III.,Stood quivering in Márícha's heart.
32678,BOOK III.,"Scarce from the ground one foot he sprang,"
32679,BOOK III.,Then stricken fell with deadly pang.
32680,BOOK III.,"Half lifeless, as he pressed the ground,"
32681,BOOK III.,He gave a roar of awful sound
32682,BOOK III.,And ere the wounded giant died
32683,BOOK III.,He threw his borrowed form aside
32684,BOOK III.,Remembering still his lord's behest
32685,BOOK III.,He pondered in his heart how best
32686,BOOK III.,"Sítá might send her guard away,"
32687,BOOK III.,And Rávan seize the helpless prey.
32688,BOOK III.,"The monster knew the time was nigh,"
32689,BOOK III.,"And called aloud with eager cry,"
32690,BOOK III.,"""Ho, Sítá, Lakshman"" and the tone"
32691,BOOK III.,He borrowed was like Ráma's own.
32692,BOOK III.,
32693,BOOK III.,"So by that matchless arrow cleft,"
32694,BOOK III.,"The deer's bright form Márícha left,"
32695,BOOK III.,Resumed his giant shape and size
32696,BOOK III.,And closed in death his languid eyes.
32697,BOOK III.,When Ráma saw his awful foe
32698,BOOK III.,"Gasp, smeared with blood, in deadly throe,"
32699,BOOK III.,"His anxious thoughts to Sítá sped,"
32700,BOOK III.,"And the wise words that Lakshman said,"
32701,BOOK III.,"That this was false Márícha's art,"
32702,BOOK III.,Returned again upon his heart.
32703,BOOK III.,He knew the foe he triumphed o'er
32704,BOOK III.,The name of great Márícha bore.
32705,BOOK III.,"""The fiend,"" he pondered, 'ere he died,"
32706,BOOK III.,"""Ho, Lakshman! ho, my Sítá!"" cried"
32707,BOOK III.,"Ah, if that cry has reached her ear,"
32708,BOOK III.,How dire must be my darling's fear!
32709,BOOK III.,"And Lakshman of the mighty arm,"
32710,BOOK III.,What thinks he in his wild alarm?
32711,BOOK III.,"As thus he thought in sad surmise,"
32712,BOOK III.,"Each startled hair began to rise,"
32713,BOOK III.,And when he saw the giant slain
32714,BOOK III.,"And thought upon that cry again,"
32715,BOOK III.,His spirit sank and terror pressed
32716,BOOK III.,Full sorely on the hero's breast.
32717,BOOK III.,"Another deer he chased and struck,"
32718,BOOK III.,"He bore away the the fallen buck,"

32827,BOOK III.,"Thou, wretch, thine aid wilt still deny,"
32828,BOOK III.,And leave my lord alone to die.
32829,BOOK III.,"Has love of me unnerved thy hand,"
32830,BOOK III.,Or Bharat's art this ruin planned?
32831,BOOK III.,"But be the treachery his or thine,"
32832,BOOK III.,"In vain, in vain the base design."
32833,BOOK III.,"For how shall I, the chosen bride"
32834,BOOK III.,"Of dark-hued Ráma, lotus-eyed,"
32835,BOOK III.,"The queen who once called Ráma mine,"
32836,BOOK III.,To love of other men decline?
32837,BOOK III.,"Believe me, Lakshman, Ráma's wife"
32838,BOOK III.,"Before thine eyes will quit this life,"
32839,BOOK III.,And not a moment will she stay
32840,BOOK III.,"If her dear lord have passed away."""
32841,BOOK III.,
32842,BOOK III.,"The lady's bitter speech, that stirred"
32843,BOOK III.,"Each hair upon his frame, he heard."
32844,BOOK III.,"With lifted hands together laid,"
32845,BOOK III.,His calm reply he gently made:
32846,BOOK III.,
32847,BOOK III.,"""No words have I to answer now:"
32848,BOOK III.,"My deity, O Queen, art thou."
32849,BOOK III.,"But 'tis no marvel, dame, to find"
32850,BOOK III.,Such lack of sense in womankind.
32851,BOOK III.,"Throughout this world, O Maithil dame,"
32852,BOOK III.,Weak women's hearts are still the same.
32853,BOOK III.,"Inconstant, urged by envious spite,"
32854,BOOK III.,They sever friends and hate the right.
32855,BOOK III.,"I cannot brook, Videhan Queen,"
32856,BOOK III.,Thy words intolerably keen.
32857,BOOK III.,Mine ears thy fierce reproaches pain
32858,BOOK III.,As boiling water seethes the brain.
32859,BOOK III.,And now to bear me witness all
32860,BOOK III.,"The dwellers in the wood I call,"
32861,BOOK III.,"That, when with words of truth I plead,"
32862,BOOK III.,This harsh reply is all my meed.
32863,BOOK III.,"Ah, woe is thee! Ah, grief, that still"
32864,BOOK III.,"Eager to do my brother's will,"
32865,BOOK III.,"Mourning thy woman's nature, I"
32866,BOOK III.,Must see thee doubt my truth and die.
32867,BOOK III.,"I fly to Ráma's side, and Oh,"
32868,BOOK III.,May bliss attend thee while I go!
32869,BOOK III.,May all attendant wood-gods screen
32870,BOOK III.,"Thy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen!"
32871,BOOK III.,And though dire omens meet my sight
32872,BOOK III.,"And fill my soul with wild affright,"
32873,BOOK III.,May I return in peace and see
32874,BOOK III.,"The son of Raghu safe with thee!"""
32875,BOOK III.,
32876,BOOK III.,"The child of Janak heard him speak,"
32877,BOOK III.,"And the hot tear-drops down her cheek,"
32878,BOOK III.,"Increasing to a torrent, ran,"
32879,BOOK III.,As thus once more the dame began:
32880,BOOK III.,"""O Lakshman, if I widowed be"
32881,BOOK III.,"Godávarí's flood shall cover me,"
32882,BOOK III.,"Or I will die by cord, or leap,"
32883,BOOK III.,"Life weary, from yon rocky steep;"
32884,BOOK III.,"Or deadly poison will I drink,"
32885,BOOK III.,"Or 'neath the kindled flames will sink,"
32886,BOOK III.,"But never, reft of Ráma, can"
32887,BOOK III.,"Consent to touch a meaner man."""
32888,BOOK III.,
32889,BOOK III.,"The Maithil dame with many sighs,"
32890,BOOK III.,"And torrents pouring from her eyes,"
32891,BOOK III.,"The faithful Lakshman thus addressed,"
32892,BOOK III.,And smote her hands upon her breast.
32893,BOOK III.,">Sumitrá's son, o'erwhelmed by fears,"
32894,BOOK III.,Looked on the large-eyed queen:
32895,BOOK III.,"He saw that flood of burning tears,"
32896,BOOK III.,He saw that piteous mien.
32897,BOOK III.,"He yearned sweet comfort to afford,"
32898,BOOK III.,He strove to soothe her pain;
32899,BOOK III.,But to the brother of her lord
32900,BOOK III.,She spoke no word again.
32901,BOOK III.,"His reverent hands once more he raised,"
32902,BOOK III.,"His head he slightly bent,"
32903,BOOK III.,"Upon her face he sadly gazed,"
32904,BOOK III.,And then toward Ráma went.

32910,BOOK III.,
32911,BOOK III.,
32912,BOOK III.,The angry Lakshman scarce could brook
32913,BOOK III.,"Her bitter words, her furious look."
32914,BOOK III.,With dark forebodings in his breast
32915,BOOK III.,To Ráma's side he quickly pressed.
32916,BOOK III.,
32917,BOOK III.,Then ten necked Rávan saw the time
32918,BOOK III.,Propitious for his purposed crime.
32919,BOOK III.,A mendicant in guise he came
32920,BOOK III.,And stood before the Maithil dame.
32921,BOOK III.,"His garb was red, with tufted hair"
32922,BOOK III.,"And sandalled feet a shade he bare,"
32923,BOOK III.,And from the fiend's left shoulder slung
32924,BOOK III.,A staff and water-vessel hung.
32925,BOOK III.,"Near to the lovely dame he drew,"
32926,BOOK III.,"While both the chiefs were far from view,"
32927,BOOK III.,As darkness takes the evening air
32928,BOOK III.,When neither sun nor moon is there.
32929,BOOK III.,"He bent his eye upon the dame,"
32930,BOOK III.,"A princess fair, of spotless fame:"
32931,BOOK III.,So might some baleful planet be
32932,BOOK III.,Near Moon-forsaken Rohiní.(495)
32933,BOOK III.,"As the fierce tyrant nearer drew,"
32934,BOOK III.,The trees in Janasthán that grew
32935,BOOK III.,"Waved not a leaf for fear and woe,"
32936,BOOK III.,And the hushed wind forbore to blow.
32937,BOOK III.,"Godávarí's waters as they fled,"
32938,BOOK III.,"Saw his fierce eye-balls flashing red,"
32939,BOOK III.,And from each swiftly-gliding wave
32940,BOOK III.,A melancholy murmur gave.
32941,BOOK III.,"Then Rávan, when his eager eye"
32942,BOOK III.,"Beheld the longed-for moment nigh,"
32943,BOOK III.,In mendicant's apparel dressed
32944,BOOK III.,Near to the Maithil lady pressed.
32945,BOOK III.,"In holy guise, a fiend abhorred,"
32946,BOOK III.,He found her mourning for her lord.
32947,BOOK III.,Thus threatening draws Sanischar(496) nigh
32948,BOOK III.,To Chitrá(497) in the evening sky;
32949,BOOK III.,Thus the deep well by grass concealed
32950,BOOK III.,Yawns treacherous in the verdant field.
32951,BOOK III.,He stood and looked upon the dame
32952,BOOK III.,"Of Ráma, queen of spotless fame"
32953,BOOK III.,With her bright teeth and each fair limb
32954,BOOK III.,"Like the full moon she seemed to him,"
32955,BOOK III.,"Sitting within her leafy cot,"
32956,BOOK III.,Weeping for woe that left her not.
32957,BOOK III.,"Thus, while with joy his pulses beat,"
32958,BOOK III.,"He saw her in her lone retreat,"
32959,BOOK III.,"Eyed like the lotus, fair to view"
32960,BOOK III.,In silken robes of amber hue.
32961,BOOK III.,Pierced to the core by Káma's dart
32962,BOOK III.,"He murmured texts with lying art,"
32963,BOOK III.,And questioned with a soft address
32964,BOOK III.,The lady in her loneliness.
32965,BOOK III.,The fiend essayed with gentle speech
32966,BOOK III.,"The heart of that fair dame to reach,"
32967,BOOK III.,"Pride of the worlds, like Beauty's Queen"
32968,BOOK III.,Without her darling lotus seen:
32969,BOOK III.,
32970,BOOK III.,"""O thou whose silken robes enfold"
32971,BOOK III.,"A form more fair than finest gold,"
32972,BOOK III.,"With lotus garland on thy head,"
32973,BOOK III.,"Like a sweet spring with bloom o'erspread,"
32974,BOOK III.,"Who art thou, fair one, what thy name,"
32975,BOOK III.,"Beauty, or Honour, Fortune, Fame,"
32976,BOOK III.,"Spirit, or nymph, or Queen of love"
32977,BOOK III.,Descended from thy home above?
32978,BOOK III.,Bright as the dazzling jasmine shine
32979,BOOK III.,Thy small square teeth in level line.
32980,BOOK III.,Like two black stars aglow with light
32981,BOOK III.,Thine eyes are large and pure and bright.
32982,BOOK III.,Thy charms of smile and teeth and hair
32983,BOOK III.,"And winning eyes, O thou most fair,"
32984,BOOK III.,"Steal all my spirit, as the flow"
32985,BOOK III.,Of rivers mines the bank below.
32986,BOOK III.,"How bright, how fine each flowing tress!"
32987,BOOK III.,How firm those orbs beneath thy dress!
32988,BOOK III.,"That dainty waist with ease were spanned,"
32989,BOOK III.,"Sweet lady, by a lover's hand."
32990,BOOK III.,"Mine eyes, O beauty, ne'er have seen"
32991,BOOK III.,"Goddess or nymph so fair of mien,"
32992,BOOK III.,"Or bright Gandharva's heavenly dame,"
32993,BOOK III.,Or woman of so perfect frame.
32994,BOOK III.,"In youth's soft prime thy years are few,"
32995,BOOK III.,And earth has naught so fair to view.
32996,BOOK III.,I marvel one like thee in face
32997,BOOK III.,Should make the woods her dwelling-place.
32998,BOOK III.,"Leave, lady, leave this lone retreat"
32999,BOOK III.,"In forest wilds for thee unmeet,"
33000,BOOK III.,Where giants fierce and strong assume
33001,BOOK III.,All shapes and wander in the gloom.
33002,BOOK III.,These dainty feet were formed to tread
33003,BOOK III.,"Some palace floor with carpets spread,"
33004,BOOK III.,Or wander in trim gardens where
33005,BOOK III.,Each opening bud perfumes the air.
33006,BOOK III.,"The richest robe thy form should deck,"
33007,BOOK III.,"The rarest gems adorn thy neck,"
33008,BOOK III.,"The sweetest wreath should bind thy hair,"
33009,BOOK III.,The noblest lord thy bed should share.
33010,BOOK III.,"Art thou akin, O fair of form,"
33011,BOOK III.,"To Rudras,(498) or the Gods of storm,(499)"
33012,BOOK III.,Or to the glorious Vasus(500)? How
33013,BOOK III.,Can less than these be bright as thou?
33014,BOOK III.,But never nymph or heavenly maid
33015,BOOK III.,Or Goddess haunts this gloomy shade.
33016,BOOK III.,"Here giants roam, a savage race;"
33017,BOOK III.,What led thee to so dire a place?
33018,BOOK III.,"Here monkeys leap from tree to tree,"
33019,BOOK III.,And bears and tigers wander free;
33020,BOOK III.,"Here ravening lions prowl, and fell"
33021,BOOK III.,"Hyenas in the thickets yell,"
33022,BOOK III.,"And elephants infuriate roam,"
33023,BOOK III.,"Mighty and fierce, their woodland home."
33024,BOOK III.,"Dost thou not dread, so soft and fair,"
33025,BOOK III.,"Tiger and lion, wolf and bear?"
33026,BOOK III.,"Hast thou, O beauteous dame, no fear"
33027,BOOK III.,In the wild wood so lone and drear?
33028,BOOK III.,Whose and who art thou? whence and why
33029,BOOK III.,"Sweet lady, with no guardian nigh,"
33030,BOOK III.,Dost thou this awful forest tread
33031,BOOK III.,"By giant bands inhabited?"""
33032,BOOK III.,
33033,BOOK III.,The praise the high-souled Rávan spoke
33034,BOOK III.,No doubt within her bosom woke.
33035,BOOK III.,His saintly look and Bráhman guise
33036,BOOK III.,Deceived the lady's trusting eyes.
33037,BOOK III.,With due attention on the guest
33038,BOOK III.,Her hospitable rites she pressed.
33039,BOOK III.,"She bade the stranger to a seat,"
33040,BOOK III.,And gave him water for his feet.
33041,BOOK III.,"The bowl and water-pot he bare,"
33042,BOOK III.,And garb which wandering Bráhmans wear
33043,BOOK III.,Forbade a doubt to rise.
33044,BOOK III.,Won by his holy look she deemed
33045,BOOK III.,The stranger even as he seemed
33046,BOOK III.,To her deluded eyes.
33047,BOOK III.,"Intent on hospitable care,"
33048,BOOK III.,"She brought her best of woodland fare,"
33049,BOOK III.,And showed her guest a seat.
33050,BOOK III.,She bade the saintly stranger lave
33051,BOOK III.,"His feet in water which she gave,"
33052,BOOK III.,And sit and rest and eat.
33053,BOOK III.,He kept his eager glances bent
33054,BOOK III.,"On her so kindly eloquent,"
33055,BOOK III.,Wife of the noblest king;
33056,BOOK III.,"And longed in heart to steal her thence,"
33057,BOOK III.,"Preparing by the dire offence,"
33058,BOOK III.,Death on his head to bring.
33059,BOOK III.,The lady watched with anxious face
33060,BOOK III.,For Ráma coming from the chase
33061,BOOK III.,With Lakshman by his side:
33062,BOOK III.,But nothing met her wandering glance
33063,BOOK III.,Save the wild forest's green expanse
33064,BOOK III.,Extending far and wide.

33086,BOOK III.,"Twelve pleasant years flew by, and then"
33087,BOOK III.,"His peers advised the king of men,"

33089,BOOK III.,Joint ruler of his ancient state.
33090,BOOK III.,"But when the rites were scarce begun,"
33091,BOOK III.,"To consecrate Ikshváku's son,"
33092,BOOK III.,"The queen Kaikeyí, honoured dame,"
33093,BOOK III.,Sought of her lord an ancient claim.
33094,BOOK III.,"Her plea of former service pressed,"
33095,BOOK III.,"And made him grant her new request,"
33096,BOOK III.,To banish Ráma to the wild
33097,BOOK III.,And consecrate instead her child.

33104,BOOK III.,"As thus she spake in envious ire,"
33105,BOOK III.,"The aged king, my husband's sire,"
33106,BOOK III.,Besought with fitting words; but she
33107,BOOK III.,Was cold and deaf to every plea.
33108,BOOK III.,As yet my days are few; eighteen
33109,BOOK III.,The years of life that I have seen;
33110,BOOK III.,"And Ráma, best of all alive,"
33111,BOOK III.,Has passed of years a score and five--

33120,BOOK III.,"When, hopeful of the promised grace,"
33121,BOOK III.,"My Ráma sought his father's face,"
33122,BOOK III.,"The queen Kaikeyí, ill at ease,"
33123,BOOK III.,Spoke to my lord brief words like these:
33124,BOOK III.,"""Hear, son of Raghu, hear from me"
33125,BOOK III.,The words thy father says to thee:
33126,BOOK III.,"""I yield this day to Bharat's hand,"
33127,BOOK III.,"Free from all foes, this ancient land."
33128,BOOK III.,"Fly from this home no longer thine,"
33129,BOOK III.,And dwell in woods five years and nine.
33130,BOOK III.,Live in the forest and maintain
33131,BOOK III.,"Mine honour pure from falsehood's stain.' """
33132,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma spoke, untouched by dread:"
33133,BOOK III.,"""Yea, it shall be as thou hast said."""
33134,BOOK III.,"And answered, faithful to his vows,"
33135,BOOK III.,Obeying Dasaratha's spouse:
33136,BOOK III.,"""The offered realm I would not take,"

33141,BOOK III.,"His brother by a younger dame,"
33142,BOOK III.,"Bold victor in the deadly fray,"
33143,BOOK III.,Would follow Ráma on his way.
33144,BOOK III.,"On sternest vows his heart was set,"
33145,BOOK III.,"And he, a youthful anchoret,"
33146,BOOK III.,Bound up in twisted coil his hair
33147,BOOK III.,And took the garb which hermits wear;
33148,BOOK III.,"Then with his bow to guard us, he"
33149,BOOK III.,Went forth with Ráma and with me.
33150,BOOK III.,By Queen Kaikeyí's art bereft
33151,BOOK III.,"The kingdom and our home we left,"
33152,BOOK III.,And bound by stern religious vows
33153,BOOK III.,We sought this shade of forest boughs.
33154,BOOK III.,"Now, best of Bráhmans, here we tread"
33155,BOOK III.,These pathless regions dark and dread.
33156,BOOK III.,"But come, refresh thy soul, and rest"

33161,BOOK III.,Or some great boar his hand has struck.
33162,BOOK III.,"Meanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:"
33163,BOOK III.,"Thy name, thy race, thy birth declare,"
33164,BOOK III.,And why with no companion thou
33165,BOOK III.,"Roamest in Dandak forest now."""
33166,BOOK III.,
33167,BOOK III.,"Thus questioned Sítá, Ráma's dame."
33168,BOOK III.,Then fierce the stranger's answer came:
33169,BOOK III.,"""Lord of the giant legions, he"
33170,BOOK III.,"From whom celestial armies flee,--"
33171,BOOK III.,"The dread of hell and earth and sky,"
33172,BOOK III.,Rávan the Rákshas king am I.
33173,BOOK III.,Now when thy gold-like form I view
33174,BOOK III.,"Arrayed in silks of amber hue,"
33175,BOOK III.,"My love, O thou of perfect mould,"
33176,BOOK III.,For all my dames is dead and cold.
33177,BOOK III.,"A thousand fairest women, torn"
33178,BOOK III.,From many a land my home adorn.
33179,BOOK III.,"But come, loveliest lady, be"
33180,BOOK III.,The queen of every dame and me.
33181,BOOK III.,"My city Lanká, glorious town,"
33182,BOOK III.,Looks from a mountain's forehead down
33183,BOOK III.,Where ocean with his flash and foam
33184,BOOK III.,Beats madly on mine island home.
33185,BOOK III.,"With me, O Sítá, shalt thou rove"
33186,BOOK III.,"Delighted through each shady grove,"
33187,BOOK III.,Nor shall thy happy breast retain
33188,BOOK III.,Fond memory of this life of pain.
33189,BOOK III.,"In gay attire, a glittering band,"
33190,BOOK III.,"Five thousand maids shall round thee stand,"

33192,BOOK III.,"If thou, fair Sítá, wilt be mine."""
33193,BOOK III.,
33194,BOOK III.,Then forth her noble passion broke
33195,BOOK III.,As thus in turn the lady spoke:
33196,BOOK III.,"""Me, me the wife of Ráma, him"
33197,BOOK III.,"The lion lord with lion's limb,"
33198,BOOK III.,"Strong as the sea, firm as the rock,"
33199,BOOK III.,Like Indra in the battle shock.
33200,BOOK III.,"The lord of each auspicious sign,"
33201,BOOK III.,"The glory of his princely line,"
33202,BOOK III.,"Like some fair Bodh tree strong and tall,"
33203,BOOK III.,"The noblest and the best of all,"
33204,BOOK III.,"Ráma, the heir of happy fate"
33205,BOOK III.,"Who keeps his word inviolate,"
33206,BOOK III.,"Lord of the lion gait, possessed"
33207,BOOK III.,"Of mighty arm and ample chest,"
33208,BOOK III.,"Ráma the lion-warrior, him"
33209,BOOK III.,"Whose moon bright face no fear can dim,"
33210,BOOK III.,"Ráma, his bridled passions' lord,"
33211,BOOK III.,"The darling whom his sire adored,--"
33212,BOOK III.,"Me, me the true and loving dame"
33213,BOOK III.,"Of Ráma, prince of deathless fame--"
33214,BOOK III.,Me wouldst thou vainly woo and press?
33215,BOOK III.,A jackal woo a lioness!
33216,BOOK III.,Steal from the sun his glory! such
33217,BOOK III.,Thy hope Lord Ráma's wife to touch.
33218,BOOK III.,"Ha! Thou hast seen the trees of gold,"
33219,BOOK III.,"The sign which dying eyes behold,"
33220,BOOK III.,"Thus seeking, weary of thy life,"
33221,BOOK III.,To win the love of Ráma's wife.
33222,BOOK III.,Fool! wilt thou dare to rend away
33223,BOOK III.,"The famished lion's bleeding prey,"
33224,BOOK III.,Or from the threatening jaws to take
33225,BOOK III.,The fang of some envenomed snake?
33226,BOOK III.,"What, wouldst thou shake with puny hand"
33227,BOOK III.,"Mount Mandar,(501) towering o'er the land,"
33228,BOOK III.,Put poison to thy lips and think

33233,BOOK III.,The wife whom Ráma loves so much?
33234,BOOK III.,"Be round thy neck a millstone tied,"
33235,BOOK III.,And swim the sea from side to side;
33236,BOOK III.,Or raising both thy hands on high
33237,BOOK III.,Pluck sun and moon from yonder sky;
33238,BOOK III.,"Or let the kindled flame be pressed,"
33239,BOOK III.,"Wrapt in thy garment, to thy breast;"
33240,BOOK III.,More wild the thought that seeks to win
33241,BOOK III.,Ráma's dear wife who knows not sin.
33242,BOOK III.,The fool who thinks with idle aim
33243,BOOK III.,"To gain the love of Ráma's dame,"
33244,BOOK III.,With dark and desperate footing makes
33245,BOOK III.,His way o'er points of iron stakes.
33246,BOOK III.,"As Ocean to a bubbling spring,"
33247,BOOK III.,"The lion to a fox, the king"
33248,BOOK III.,Of all the birds that ply the wing
33249,BOOK III.,To an ignoble crow
33250,BOOK III.,"As gold to lead of little price,"
33251,BOOK III.,As to the drainings of the rice
33252,BOOK III.,"The drink they quaff in Paradise,"
33253,BOOK III.,"The Amrit's heavenly flow,"
33254,BOOK III.,As sandal dust with perfume sweet
33255,BOOK III.,"Is to the mire that soils our feet,"
33256,BOOK III.,"A tiger to a cat,"
33257,BOOK III.,"As the white swan is to the owl,"
33258,BOOK III.,"The peacock to the waterfowl,"
33259,BOOK III.,"An eagle to a bat,"
33260,BOOK III.,Such is my lord compared with thee;
33261,BOOK III.,"And when with bow and arrows he,"
33262,BOOK III.,Mighty as Indra's self shall see
33263,BOOK III.,"His foeman, armed to slay,"
33264,BOOK III.,"Thou, death-doomed like the fly that sips"
33265,BOOK III.,"The oil that on the altar drips,"
33266,BOOK III.,Shalt cast the morsel from thy lips
33267,BOOK III.,"And lose thy half-won prey."""
33268,BOOK III.,Thus in high scorn the lady flung
33269,BOOK III.,The biting arrows of her tongue
33270,BOOK III.,In bitter words that pierced and stung
33271,BOOK III.,The rover of the night.
33272,BOOK III.,"She ceased. Her gentle cheek grew pale,"
33273,BOOK III.,"Her loosened limbs began to fail,"
33274,BOOK III.,And like a plantain in the gale
33275,BOOK III.,She trembled with affright.
33276,BOOK III.,"He terrible as Death stood nigh,"
33277,BOOK III.,And watched with fierce exulting eye
33278,BOOK III.,The fear that shook her frame.
33279,BOOK III.,"To terrify the lady more,"
33280,BOOK III.,"He counted all his triumphs o'er,"

33290,BOOK III.,With knitted brow and furious eye
33291,BOOK III.,The stranger made his fierce reply:
33292,BOOK III.,"""In me O fairest dame, behold"
33293,BOOK III.,The brother of the King of Gold.
33294,BOOK III.,"The Lord of Ten Necks my title, named"
33295,BOOK III.,"Rávan, for might and valour famed."
33296,BOOK III.,Gods and Gandharva hosts I scare;
33297,BOOK III.,"Snakes, spirits, birds that roam the air"
33298,BOOK III.,"Fly from my coming, wild with fear,"
33299,BOOK III.,Trembling like men when Death is near.
33300,BOOK III.,"Vaisravan once, my brother, wrought"
33301,BOOK III.,"To ire, encountered me and fought,"
33302,BOOK III.,But yielding to superior might
33303,BOOK III.,Fled from his home in sore affright.
33304,BOOK III.,"Lord of the man-drawn chariot, still"
33305,BOOK III.,He dwells on famed Kailása's hill.
33306,BOOK III.,I made the vanquished king resign
33307,BOOK III.,"The glorious car which now is mine,--"
33308,BOOK III.,"Pushpak, the far-renowned, that flies"
33309,BOOK III.,Will-guided through the buxom skies.
33310,BOOK III.,Celestial hosts by Indra led
33311,BOOK III.,"Flee from my face disquieted,"
33312,BOOK III.,And where my dreaded feet appear
33313,BOOK III.,The wind is hushed or breathless is fear.
33314,BOOK III.,"Where'er I stand, where'er I go"
33315,BOOK III.,"The troubled waters cease to flow,"
33316,BOOK III.,Each spell-bound wave is mute and still
33317,BOOK III.,And the fierce sun himself is chill.
33318,BOOK III.,Beyond the sea my Lanká stands
33319,BOOK III.,"Filled with fierce forms and giant bands,"
33320,BOOK III.,A glorious city fair to see
33321,BOOK III.,As Indra's Amarávatí.
33322,BOOK III.,"A towering height of solid wall,"
33323,BOOK III.,"Flashing afar, surrounds it all,"
33324,BOOK III.,"Its golden courts enchant the sight,"
33325,BOOK III.,And gates aglow with lazulite.
33326,BOOK III.,"Steeds, elephants, and cars are there,"
33327,BOOK III.,"And drums' loud music fills the air,"
33328,BOOK III.,Fair trees in lovely gardens grow
33329,BOOK III.,Whose boughs with varied fruitage glow.
33330,BOOK III.,"Thou, beauteous Queen, with me shalt dwell"
33331,BOOK III.,"In halls that suit a princess well,"
33332,BOOK III.,Thy former fellows shall forget
33333,BOOK III.,"Nor think of women with regret,"
33334,BOOK III.,"No earthly joy thy soul shall miss,"
33335,BOOK III.,And take its fill of heavenly bliss.
33336,BOOK III.,"Of mortal Ráma think no more,"
33337,BOOK III.,Whose terms of days will soon be o'er.
33338,BOOK III.,King Dasaratha looked in scorn
33339,BOOK III.,"On Ráma though the eldest born,"
33340,BOOK III.,"Sent to the woods the weakling fool,"
33341,BOOK III.,And set his darling son to rule.
33342,BOOK III.,"What, O thou large-eyed dame, hast thou"
33343,BOOK III.,"To do with fallen Ráma now,"
33344,BOOK III.,"From home and kingdom forced to fly,"
33345,BOOK III.,A wretched hermit soon to die?
33346,BOOK III.,"Accept thy lover, nor refuse"
33347,BOOK III.,The giant king who fondly woos.
33348,BOOK III.,"O listen, nor reject in scorn"
33349,BOOK III.,A heart by Káma's arrows torn.
33350,BOOK III.,"If thou refuse to hear my prayer,"
33351,BOOK III.,Of grief and coming woe beware;
33352,BOOK III.,For the sad fate will fall on thee
33353,BOOK III.,"Which came on hapless Urvasí,"
33354,BOOK III.,When with her foot she chanced to touch
33355,BOOK III.,"Purúravas, and sorrowed much.(502)"
33356,BOOK III.,My little finger raised in fight
33357,BOOK III.,Were more than match for Ráma's might.
33358,BOOK III.,"O fairest, blithe and happy be"
33359,BOOK III.,"With him whom fortune sends to thee."""
33360,BOOK III.,
33361,BOOK III.,"Such were the words the giant said,"
33362,BOOK III.,And Sítá's angry eyes were red.
33363,BOOK III.,She answered in that lonely place
33364,BOOK III.,The monarch of the giant race:
33365,BOOK III.,
33366,BOOK III.,"""Art thou the brother of the Lord"
33367,BOOK III.,"Of Gold by all the world adored,"
33368,BOOK III.,And sprung of that illustrious seed
33369,BOOK III.,Wouldst now attempt this evil deed?
33370,BOOK III.,"I tell thee, impious Monarch, all"
33371,BOOK III.,"The giants by thy sin will fall,"
33372,BOOK III.,"Whose reckless lord and king thou art,"
33373,BOOK III.,With foolish mind and lawless heart.
33374,BOOK III.,"Yea, one may hope to steal the wife"
33375,BOOK III.,Of Indra and escape with life.
33376,BOOK III.,But he who Ráma's dame would tear
33377,BOOK III.,From his loved side must needs despair.
33378,BOOK III.,"Yea, one may steal fair Sachí, dame"
33379,BOOK III.,"Of Him who shoots the thunder flame,"
33380,BOOK III.,May live successful in his aim
33381,BOOK III.,And length of day may see;
33382,BOOK III.,"But hope, O giant King, in vain,"
33383,BOOK III.,"Though cups of Amrit thou may drain,"
33384,BOOK III.,To shun the penalty and pain
33385,BOOK III.,"Of wronging one like me."""

33392,BOOK III.,
33393,BOOK III.,"The Rákshas monarch, thus addressed,"
33394,BOOK III.,"His hands a while together pressed,"
33395,BOOK III.,And straight before her startled eyes
33396,BOOK III.,Stood monstrous in his giant size.
33397,BOOK III.,"Then to the lady, with the lore"
33398,BOOK III.,"Of eloquence, he spoke once more:"
33399,BOOK III.,"""Thou scarce,"" he cried, ""hast heard aright"
33400,BOOK III.,The glories of my power and might.
33401,BOOK III.,I borne sublime in air can stand
33402,BOOK III.,"And with these arms upheave the land,"
33403,BOOK III.,Drink the deep flood of Ocean dry
33404,BOOK III.,"And Death with conquering force defy,"
33405,BOOK III.,Pierce the great sun with furious dart
33406,BOOK III.,And to her depths cleave earth apart.

33408,BOOK III.,"I wear each form as wills my mind."""
33409,BOOK III.,
33410,BOOK III.,As thus he spake in burning ire
33411,BOOK III.,His glowing eyes were red with fire.
33412,BOOK III.,His gentle garb aside was thrown
33413,BOOK III.,And all his native shape was shown.
33414,BOOK III.,"Terrific, monstrous, wild, and dread"
33415,BOOK III.,"As the dark God who rules the dead,"
33416,BOOK III.,"His fiery eyes in fury rolled,"
33417,BOOK III.,His limbs were decked with glittering gold.
33418,BOOK III.,"Like some dark cloud the monster showed,"
33419,BOOK III.,And his fierce breast with fury glowed.
33420,BOOK III.,"The ten-faced rover of the night,"
33421,BOOK III.,"With twenty arms exposed to sight,"
33422,BOOK III.,His saintly guise aside had laid
33423,BOOK III.,And all his giant height displayed.
33424,BOOK III.,Attired in robes of crimson dye
33425,BOOK III.,He stood and watched with angry eye
33426,BOOK III.,The lady in her bright array
33427,BOOK III.,Resplendent as the dawn of day
33428,BOOK III.,"When from the east the sunbeams break,"
33429,BOOK III.,And to the dark-haired lady spake:
33430,BOOK III.,"""If thou would call that lord thine own"
33431,BOOK III.,"Whose fame in every world is known,"
33432,BOOK III.,"Look kindly on my love, and be"
33433,BOOK III.,Bride of a consort meet for thee.
33434,BOOK III.,"With me let blissful years be spent,"
33435,BOOK III.,For ne'er thy choice shalt thou repent.
33436,BOOK III.,No deed of mine shall e'er displease
33437,BOOK III.,My darling as she lives at ease.
33438,BOOK III.,"Thy love for mortal man resign,"
33439,BOOK III.,And to a worthier lord incline.
33440,BOOK III.,"Ah foolish lady, seeming wise"
33441,BOOK III.,"In thine own weak and partial eyes,"
33442,BOOK III.,By what fair graces art thou held
33443,BOOK III.,To Ráma from his realm expelled?
33444,BOOK III.,"Misfortunes all his life attend,"
33445,BOOK III.,And his brief days are near their end.
33446,BOOK III.,"Unworthy prince, infirm of mind!"
33447,BOOK III.,A woman spoke and he resigned
33448,BOOK III.,His home and kingdom and withdrew
33449,BOOK III.,From troops of friends and retinue.
33450,BOOK III.,And sought this forest dark and dread
33451,BOOK III.,"By savage beasts inhabited."""
33452,BOOK III.,
33453,BOOK III.,Thus Rávan urged the lady meet
33454,BOOK III.,"For love, whose words were soft and sweet."
33455,BOOK III.,Near and more near the giant pressed
33456,BOOK III.,As love's hot fire inflamed his breast.
33457,BOOK III.,The leader of the giant crew
33458,BOOK III.,His arm around the lady threw:
33459,BOOK III.,Thus Budha(503) with ill-omened might
33460,BOOK III.,Steals Rohiní's delicious light.
33461,BOOK III.,"One hand her glorious tresses grasped,"
33462,BOOK III.,One with its ruthless pressure clasped
33463,BOOK III.,"The body of his lovely prize,"
33464,BOOK III.,The Maithil dame with lotus eyes.
33465,BOOK III.,The silvan Gods in wild alarm
33466,BOOK III.,"Marked his huge teeth and ponderous arm,"
33467,BOOK III.,"And from that Death-like presence fled,"
33468,BOOK III.,Of mountain size and towering head.
33469,BOOK III.,Then seen was Rávan's magic car
33470,BOOK III.,"Aglow with gold which blazed afar,--"
33471,BOOK III.,The mighty car which asses drew
33472,BOOK III.,Thundering as it onward flew.
33473,BOOK III.,He spared not harsh rebuke to chide
33474,BOOK III.,"The lady as she moaned and cried,"
33475,BOOK III.,Then with his arm about her waist
33476,BOOK III.,His captive in the car he placed.
33477,BOOK III.,In vain he threatened: long and shrill
33478,BOOK III.,"Rang out her lamentation still,"
33479,BOOK III.,O Ráma! which no fear could stay:
33480,BOOK III.,But her dear lord was far away.
33481,BOOK III.,"Then rose the fiend, and toward the skies"
33482,BOOK III.,Bore his poor helpless struggling prize:
33483,BOOK III.,Hurrying through the air above
33484,BOOK III.,The dame who loathed his proffered love.
33485,BOOK III.,So might a soaring eagle bear
33486,BOOK III.,A serpent's consort through the air.
33487,BOOK III.,As on he bore her through the sky
33488,BOOK III.,She shrieked aloud her bitter cry.
33489,BOOK III.,As when some wretch's lips complain
33490,BOOK III.,In agony of maddening pain;
33491,BOOK III.,"""O Lakshman, thou whose joy is still"
33492,BOOK III.,"To do thine elder brother's will,"

33495,BOOK III.,"Thou who couldst leave bliss, fortune, all,"
33496,BOOK III.,"Yea life itself at duty's call,"
33497,BOOK III.,Dost thou not see this outrage done
33498,BOOK III.,"To hapless me, O Raghu's son?"
33499,BOOK III.,"'Tis thine, O victor of the foe,"
33500,BOOK III.,"To bring the haughtiest spirit low,"

33502,BOOK III.,And let the guilty fiend go free?
33503,BOOK III.,"Ah, seldom in a moment's time"
33504,BOOK III.,"Comes bitter fruit of sin and crime,"
33505,BOOK III.,But in the day of harvest pain
33506,BOOK III.,Comes like the ripening of the grain.
33507,BOOK III.,So thou whom fate and folly lead
33508,BOOK III.,"To ruin for this guilty deed,"
33509,BOOK III.,Shalt die by Ráma's arm ere long
33510,BOOK III.,A dreadful death for hideous wrong.
33511,BOOK III.,"Ah, too successful in their ends"
33512,BOOK III.,"Are Queen Kaikeyí and her friends,"
33513,BOOK III.,"When virtuous Ráma, dear to fame,"
33514,BOOK III.,Is mourning for his ravished dame.
33515,BOOK III.,"Ah me, ah me! a long farewell"
33516,BOOK III.,To lawn and glade and forest dell

33518,BOOK III.,The Cassia trees are bright and fair
33519,BOOK III.,With all your tongues to Ráma say

33525,BOOK III.,All ye to Ráma's ear relate

33527,BOOK III.,O all ye Gods who love this ground
33528,BOOK III.,"Where trees of every leaf abound,"

33539,BOOK III.,"O, if he knew I dwelt in hell,"
33540,BOOK III.,"My mighty lord, I know full well,"

33544,BOOK III.,Thus from the air the lady sent

33547,BOOK III.,The vulture on a lofty tree.
33548,BOOK III.,"As Rávan bore her swiftly by,"
33549,BOOK III.,"On the dear bird she bent her eye,"
33550,BOOK III.,And with a voice which woe made faint
33551,BOOK III.,Renewed to him her wild complaint:
33552,BOOK III.,
33553,BOOK III.,"""O see, the king who rules the race"
33554,BOOK III.,"Of giants, cruel, fierce and base,"
33555,BOOK III.,Rávan the spoiler bears me hence

33557,BOOK III.,This fiend who roves in midnight shade
33558,BOOK III.,"By thee, dear bird, can ne'er be stayed,"

33643,BOOK III.,Nor lift a load too great to bear.
33644,BOOK III.,Content is he with wholesome food
33645,BOOK III.,"Which gives him life and strength renewed,"
33646,BOOK III.,But who would dare the guilty deed
33647,BOOK III.,"That brings no fame or glorious meed,"
33648,BOOK III.,Where merit there is none to win
33649,BOOK III.,And vengeance soon o'ertakes the sin?
33650,BOOK III.,"My course of life, Pulastya's son,"
33651,BOOK III.,For sixty thousand years has run.
33652,BOOK III.,Lord of my kind I still maintain
33653,BOOK III.,Mine old hereditary reign.
33654,BOOK III.,"I, worn by years, am older far"
33655,BOOK III.,"Than thou, young lord of bow and car,"
33656,BOOK III.,In coat of glittering mail encased
33657,BOOK III.,"And armed with arrows at thy waist,"
33658,BOOK III.,"But not unchallenged shalt thou go,"
33659,BOOK III.,Or steal the dame without a blow.
33660,BOOK III.,"Thou canst not, King, before mine eyes"
33661,BOOK III.,"Bear off unchecked thy lovely prize,"
33662,BOOK III.,Safe as the truth of Scripture bent
33663,BOOK III.,By no close logic's argument.
33664,BOOK III.,"Stay if thy courage let thee, stay"
33665,BOOK III.,"And meet me in the battle fray,"
33666,BOOK III.,And thou shalt stain the earth with gore
33667,BOOK III.,Falling as Khara fell before.
33668,BOOK III.,"Soon Ráma, clothed in bark, shall smite"
33669,BOOK III.,"Thee, his proud foe, in deadly fight,--"
33670,BOOK III.,"Ráma, from whom have oft times fled"
33671,BOOK III.,The Daitya hosts discomfited.
33672,BOOK III.,No power have I to kill or slay:
33673,BOOK III.,"The princely youths are far away,"
33674,BOOK III.,But soon shalt thou with fearful eye
33675,BOOK III.,Struck down beneath their arrows lie.
33676,BOOK III.,"But while I yet have life and sense,"
33677,BOOK III.,"Thou shalt not, tyrant, carry hence"
33678,BOOK III.,"Fair Sítá, Ramá's honoured queen,"
33679,BOOK III.,With lotus eyes and lovely mien.
33680,BOOK III.,"Whate'er the pain, whate'er the cost,"
33681,BOOK III.,"Though in the struggle life be lost,"
33682,BOOK III.,The will of Raghu's noblest son
33683,BOOK III.,And Dasaratha must be done.
33684,BOOK III.,"Stay for a while, O Rávan, stay,"
33685,BOOK III.,"One hour thy flying car delay,"
33686,BOOK III.,And from that glorious chariot thou
33687,BOOK III.,"Shalt fall like fruit from shaken bough,"
33688,BOOK III.,"For I to thee, while yet I live,"
33689,BOOK III.,"The welcome of a foe will give."""

33694,BOOK III.,Canto LI. The Combat.
33695,BOOK III.,
33696,BOOK III.,
33697,BOOK III.,Rávan's red eyes in fury rolled:
33698,BOOK III.,"Bright with his armlets' flashing gold,"
33699,BOOK III.,"In high disdain, by passion stirred"
33700,BOOK III.,He rushed against the sovereign bird.
33701,BOOK III.,With clash and din and furious blows
33702,BOOK III.,Of murderous battle met the foes:
33703,BOOK III.,Thus urged by winds two clouds on high
33704,BOOK III.,Meet warring in the stormy sky.
33705,BOOK III.,Then fierce the dreadful combat raged
33706,BOOK III.,"As fiend and bird in war engaged,"
33707,BOOK III.,As if two winged mountains sped
33708,BOOK III.,To dire encounter overhead.
33709,BOOK III.,"Keen pointed arrows thick and fast,"
33710,BOOK III.,"In never ceasing fury cast,"
33711,BOOK III.,Rained hurtling on the vulture king
33712,BOOK III.,And smote him on the breast and wing.
33713,BOOK III.,But still that noblest bird sustained
33714,BOOK III.,"The cloud of shafts which Rávan rained,"
33715,BOOK III.,And with strong beak and talons bent
33716,BOOK III.,The body of his foeman rent.
33717,BOOK III.,Then wild with rage the ten-necked king
33718,BOOK III.,"Laid ten swift arrows on his string,--"
33719,BOOK III.,"Dread as the staff of Death were they,"
33720,BOOK III.,So terrible and keen to slay.
33721,BOOK III.,"Straight to his ear the string he drew,"
33722,BOOK III.,"Straight to the mark the arrows flew,"
33723,BOOK III.,And pierced by every iron head
33724,BOOK III.,The vulture's mangled body bled.
33725,BOOK III.,One glance upon the car he bent
33726,BOOK III.,"Where Sítá wept with shrill lament,"
33727,BOOK III.,Then heedless of his wounds and pain
33728,BOOK III.,Rushed at the giant king again.
33729,BOOK III.,Then the brave vulture with the stroke
33730,BOOK III.,Of his resistless talons broke
33731,BOOK III.,The giant's shafts and bow whereon
33732,BOOK III.,The fairest pearls and jewels shone.
33733,BOOK III.,"The monster paused, by rage unmanned:"
33734,BOOK III.,"A second bow soon armed his hand,"
33735,BOOK III.,Whence pointed arrows swift and true
33736,BOOK III.,"In hundreds, yea in thousands, flew."
33737,BOOK III.,"The monarch of the vultures, plied"
33738,BOOK III.,"With ceaseless darts on every side,"
33739,BOOK III.,Showed like a bird that turns to rest
33740,BOOK III.,Close covered by the branch-built nest.
33741,BOOK III.,He shook his pinions to repel
33742,BOOK III.,The storm of arrows as it fell;
33743,BOOK III.,Then with his talons snapped in two
33744,BOOK III.,The mighty bow which Rávan drew.
33745,BOOK III.,Next with terrific wing he smote
33746,BOOK III.,"So fiercely on the giant's coat,"
33747,BOOK III.,"The harness, glittering with the glow"
33748,BOOK III.,"Of fire, gave way beneath the blow."
33749,BOOK III.,With storm of murderous strokes he beat
33750,BOOK III.,"The harnessed asses strong and fleet,--"
33751,BOOK III.,Each with a goblin's monstrous face
33752,BOOK III.,And plates of gold his neck to grace.
33753,BOOK III.,"Then on the car he turned his ire,--"
33754,BOOK III.,"The will-moved car that shone like fire,"
33755,BOOK III.,"And broke the glorious chariot, broke"
33756,BOOK III.,The golden steps and pole and yoke.
33757,BOOK III.,The chouris and the silken shade
33758,BOOK III.,"Like the full moon to view displayed,"
33759,BOOK III.,Together with the guards who held
33760,BOOK III.,"Those emblems, to the ground he felled."
33761,BOOK III.,The royal vulture hovered o'er
33762,BOOK III.,"The driver's head, and pierced and tore"
33763,BOOK III.,With his strong beak and dreaded claws
33764,BOOK III.,His mangled brow and cheek and jaws.
33765,BOOK III.,"With broken car and sundered bow,"
33766,BOOK III.,"His charioteer and team laid low,"
33767,BOOK III.,"One arm about the lady wound,"
33768,BOOK III.,Sprang the fierce giant to the ground.
33769,BOOK III.,"Spectators of the combat, all"
33770,BOOK III.,The spirits viewed the monster's fall:
33771,BOOK III.,Lauding the vulture every one
33772,BOOK III.,"Cried with glad voice, Well done! well done!"
33773,BOOK III.,"But weak with length of days, at last"
33774,BOOK III.,The vulture's strength was failing fast.
33775,BOOK III.,The fiend again assayed to bear
33776,BOOK III.,The lady through the fields of air.
33777,BOOK III.,But when the vulture saw him rise
33778,BOOK III.,"Triumphant with his trembling prize,"
33779,BOOK III.,Bearing the sword that still was left
33780,BOOK III.,"When other arms were lost or cleft,"
33781,BOOK III.,"Once more, impatient of repose,"
33782,BOOK III.,"Swift from the earth her champion rose,"
33783,BOOK III.,"Hung in the way the fiend would take,"
33784,BOOK III.,And thus addressing Rávan spake:
33785,BOOK III.,"""Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,"
33786,BOOK III.,"Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,"
33787,BOOK III.,"Stealing the wife of Ráma, him"
33788,BOOK III.,With lightning scars on chest and limb.
33789,BOOK III.,A mighty host obeys his will
33790,BOOK III.,And troops of slaves his palace fill;
33791,BOOK III.,"His lords of state are wise and true,"
33792,BOOK III.,Kinsmen has he and retinue.
33793,BOOK III.,"As thirsty travellers drain the cup,"
33794,BOOK III.,Thou drinkest deadly poison up.
33795,BOOK III.,The rash and careless fool who heeds
33796,BOOK III.,"No coming fruit of guilty deeds,"
33797,BOOK III.,"A few short years of life shall see,"
33798,BOOK III.,And perish doomed to death like thee.
33799,BOOK III.,Say whither wilt thou fly to loose
33800,BOOK III.,"Thy neck from Death's entangling noose,"
33801,BOOK III.,Caught like the fish that finds too late
33802,BOOK III.,The hook beneath the treacherous bait?
33803,BOOK III.,"Never, O King--of this be sure--"
33804,BOOK III.,"Will Raghu's fiery sons endure,"
33805,BOOK III.,"Terrific in their vengeful rage,"
33806,BOOK III.,This insult to their hermitage.
33807,BOOK III.,Thy guilty hands this day have done
33808,BOOK III.,"A deed which all reprove and shun,"
33809,BOOK III.,"Unworthly of a noble chief,"
33810,BOOK III.,The pillage loved by coward thief.
33811,BOOK III.,"Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stay"
33812,BOOK III.,And meet me in the deadly fray.
33813,BOOK III.,"Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,"
33814,BOOK III.,And fall as Khara fell before.
33815,BOOK III.,The fruits of former deeds o'erpower
33816,BOOK III.,The sinner in his dying hour:
33817,BOOK III.,"And such a fate on thee, O King,"
33818,BOOK III.,Thy tyranny and madness bring.
33819,BOOK III.,"Not e'en the Self-existent Lord,"
33820,BOOK III.,"Who reigns by all the worlds adored,"
33821,BOOK III.,Would dare attempt a guilty deed
33822,BOOK III.,"Which the dire fruits of crime succeed."""
33823,BOOK III.,
33824,BOOK III.,"Thus brave Jatáyus, best of birds,"
33825,BOOK III.,"Addressed the fiend with moving words,"
33826,BOOK III.,Then ready for the swift attack
33827,BOOK III.,Swooped down upon the giant's back.
33828,BOOK III.,Down to the bone the talons went;
33829,BOOK III.,With many a wound the flesh was rent:
33830,BOOK III.,Such blows infuriate drivers deal
33831,BOOK III.,Their elephants with pointed steel.
33832,BOOK III.,"Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,"
33833,BOOK III.,The talons stripped the flesh away.
33834,BOOK III.,"He fought with claws and beak and wing,"
33835,BOOK III.,And tore the long hair of the king.
33836,BOOK III.,Still as the royal vulture beat
33837,BOOK III.,"The giant with his wings and feet,"
33838,BOOK III.,"Swelled the fiend's lips, his body shook"
33839,BOOK III.,With furious rage too great to brook.
33840,BOOK III.,About the Maithil dame he cast
33841,BOOK III.,One huge left arm and held her fast.
33842,BOOK III.,In furious rage to frenzy fanned
33843,BOOK III.,He struck the vulture with his hand.
33844,BOOK III.,"Jatáyus mocked the vain assay,"
33845,BOOK III.,And rent his ten left arms away.
33846,BOOK III.,Down dropped the severed limbs: anew
33847,BOOK III.,Ten others from his body grew:
33848,BOOK III.,Thus bright with pearly radiance glide
33849,BOOK III.,"Dread serpents from the hillock side,"
33850,BOOK III.,Again in wrath the giant pressed
33851,BOOK III.,"The lady closer to his breast,"
33852,BOOK III.,And foot and fist sent blow on blow
33853,BOOK III.,In ceaseless fury at the foe.
33854,BOOK III.,"So fierce and dire the battle, waged"
33855,BOOK III.,"Between those mighty champions, raged:"
33856,BOOK III.,"Here was the lord of giants, there"
33857,BOOK III.,The noblest of the birds of air.
33858,BOOK III.,"Thus, as his love of Ráma taught,"
33859,BOOK III.,The faithful vulture strove and fought.
33860,BOOK III.,But Rávan seized his sword and smote
33861,BOOK III.,His wings and side and feet and throat.
33862,BOOK III.,At mangled side and wing he bled;
33863,BOOK III.,"He fell, and life was almost fled."
33864,BOOK III.,"The lady saw her champion lie,"
33865,BOOK III.,"His plumes distained with gory dye,"
33866,BOOK III.,And hastened to the vulture's side
33867,BOOK III.,Grieving as though a kinsman died.
33868,BOOK III.,The lord of Lanká's island viewed
33869,BOOK III.,The vulture as he lay:
33870,BOOK III.,"Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,"
33871,BOOK III.,"His breast a paly grey,"
33872,BOOK III.,"Like ashes, when by none renewed,"
33873,BOOK III.,The flame has died away.
33874,BOOK III.,"The lady saw with mournful eye,"
33875,BOOK III.,"Her champion press the plain,--"
33876,BOOK III.,"The royal bird, her true ally"
33877,BOOK III.,Whom Rávan's might had slain.
33878,BOOK III.,Her soft arms locked in strict embrace
33879,BOOK III.,"Around his neck she kept,"
33880,BOOK III.,And lovely with her moon-bright face
33881,BOOK III.,Bent o'er her friend and wept.

33910,BOOK III.,She with weak arms and trembling knees
33911,BOOK III.,"Clung like a creeper to the trees,"
33912,BOOK III.,And like some poor deserted thing
33913,BOOK III.,With wild shrieks made the forest ring.
33914,BOOK III.,"But swift the giant reached her side,"

33922,BOOK III.,"All nature shook convulsed with dread,"
33923,BOOK III.,And darkness o'er the land was spread.
33924,BOOK III.,"The Lord of Day grew dark and chill,"
33925,BOOK III.,And every breath of air was still.
33926,BOOK III.,The Eternal Father of the sky
33927,BOOK III.,"Beheld the crime with heavenly eye,"
33928,BOOK III.,"And spake with solemn voice, ""The deed,"
33929,BOOK III.,"The deed is done, of old decreed."""
33930,BOOK III.,"Sad were the saints within the grove,"
33931,BOOK III.,But triumph with their sorrow strove.
33932,BOOK III.,They wept to see the Maithil dame
33933,BOOK III.,"Endure the outrage, scorn, and shame:"
33934,BOOK III.,They joyed because his life should pay
33935,BOOK III.,The penalty incurred that day.
33936,BOOK III.,"Then Rávan raised her up, and bare"

33938,BOOK III.,Calling with accents loud and shrill
33939,BOOK III.,On Ráma and on Lakshman still.
33940,BOOK III.,"With sparkling gems on arm and breast,"
33941,BOOK III.,"In silk of paly amber dressed,"
33942,BOOK III.,High in the air the Maithil dame
33943,BOOK III.,Gleamed like the lightning's flashing flame.
33944,BOOK III.,"The giant, as the breezes blew"
33945,BOOK III.,"Upon her robes of amber hue,"
33946,BOOK III.,"And round him twined that gay attire,"
33947,BOOK III.,Showed like a mountain girt with fire.
33948,BOOK III.,"The lady, fairest of the fair,"
33949,BOOK III.,Had wreathed a garland round her hair;
33950,BOOK III.,Its lotus petals bright and sweet
33951,BOOK III.,Rained down about the giant's feet.
33952,BOOK III.,"Her vesture, bright as burning gold,"
33953,BOOK III.,"Gave to the wind each glittering fold,"
33954,BOOK III.,Fair as a gilded cloud that gleams

33956,BOOK III.,"Yet struggling in the fiend's embrace,"
33957,BOOK III.,"The lady with her sweet pure face,"
33958,BOOK III.,"Far from her lord, no longer wore"
33959,BOOK III.,The light of joy that shone before.
33960,BOOK III.,Like some sad lily by the side
33961,BOOK III.,Of waters which the sun has dried;
33962,BOOK III.,Like the pale moon uprising through
33963,BOOK III.,"An autumn cloud of darkest hue,"
33964,BOOK III.,So was her perfect face between
33965,BOOK III.,The arms of giant Rávan seen:
33966,BOOK III.,Fair with the charm of braided tress
33967,BOOK III.,And forehead's finished loveliness;
33968,BOOK III.,Fair with the ivory teeth that shed
33969,BOOK III.,"White lustre through the lips' fine red,"
33970,BOOK III.,Fair as the lotus when the bud
33971,BOOK III.,Is rising from the parent flood.
33972,BOOK III.,"With faultless lip and nose and eye,"
33973,BOOK III.,Dear as the moon that floods the sky
33974,BOOK III.,"With gentle light, of perfect mould,"
33975,BOOK III.,"She seemed a thing of burnished gold,"
33976,BOOK III.,Though on her cheek the traces lay
33977,BOOK III.,Of tears her hand had brushed away.
33978,BOOK III.,But as the moon-beams swiftly fade
33979,BOOK III.,"Ere the great Day-God shines displayed,"
33980,BOOK III.,So in that form of perfect grace
33981,BOOK III.,"Still trembling in the fiend's embrace,"
33982,BOOK III.,"From her beloved Ráma reft,"
33983,BOOK III.,No light of pride or joy was left.
33984,BOOK III.,The lady with her golden hue
33985,BOOK III.,"O'er the swart fiend a lustre threw,"
33986,BOOK III.,As when embroidered girths enfold
33987,BOOK III.,An elephant with gleams of gold.
33988,BOOK III.,"Fair as the lily's bending stem,--"
33989,BOOK III.,"Her arms adorned with many a gem,"
33990,BOOK III.,A lustre to the fiend she lent
33991,BOOK III.,"Gleaming from every ornament,"
33992,BOOK III.,As when the cloud-shot flashes light
33993,BOOK III.,The shadows of a mountain height.
33994,BOOK III.,Whene'er the breezes earthward bore
33995,BOOK III.,"The tinkling of the zone she wore,"
33996,BOOK III.,He seemed a cloud of darkness hue
33997,BOOK III.,Sending forth murmurs as it flew.
33998,BOOK III.,As on her way the dame was sped
33999,BOOK III.,"From her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,"
34000,BOOK III.,The swift wind caught the flowery rain
34001,BOOK III.,And poured it o'er the fiend again.
34002,BOOK III.,"The wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,"
34003,BOOK III.,"On the dark brows of Rávan fell,"
34004,BOOK III.,Like lunar constellations set
34005,BOOK III.,On Meru for a coronet.
34006,BOOK III.,From her small foot an anklet fair
34007,BOOK III.,"With jewels slipped, and through the air,"
34008,BOOK III.,Like a bright circlet of the flame
34009,BOOK III.,"Of thunder, to the valley came."
34010,BOOK III.,"The Maithil lady, fair to see"
34011,BOOK III.,As the young leaflet of a tree
34012,BOOK III.,"Clad in the tender hues of spring,"
34013,BOOK III.,"Flashed glory on the giant king,"
34014,BOOK III.,As when a gold-embroidered zone
34015,BOOK III.,Around an elephant is thrown.
34016,BOOK III.,"While, bearing far the lady, through"
34017,BOOK III.,"The realms of sky the giant flew,"
34018,BOOK III.,She like a gleaming meteor cast
34019,BOOK III.,A glory round her as she passed.
34020,BOOK III.,Then from each limb in swift descent
34021,BOOK III.,Dropped many a sparkling ornament:
34022,BOOK III.,On earth they rested dim and pale
34023,BOOK III.,Like fallen stars when virtues fail.(504)
34024,BOOK III.,Around her neck a garland lay
34025,BOOK III.,Bright as the Star-God's silvery ray:
34026,BOOK III.,It fell and flashed like Gangá sent
34027,BOOK III.,From heaven above the firmament.(505)
34028,BOOK III.,The birds of every wing had flocked
34029,BOOK III.,To stately trees by breezes rocked:
34030,BOOK III.,These bowed their wind-swept heads and said:
34031,BOOK III.,"""My lady sweet, be comforted."""
34032,BOOK III.,With faded blooms each brook within
34033,BOOK III.,"Whose waters moved no gleamy fin,"
34034,BOOK III.,Stole sadly through the forest dell
34035,BOOK III.,Mourning the dame it loved so well.
34036,BOOK III.,From every woodland region near
34037,BOOK III.,"Came lions, tigers, birds, and deer,"
34038,BOOK III.,"And followed, each with furious look,"
34039,BOOK III.,The way her flying shadow took.
34040,BOOK III.,For Sítá's loss each lofty hill
34041,BOOK III.,"Whose tears were waterfall, and rill,"
34042,BOOK III.,"Lifting on high each arm-like steep,"
34043,BOOK III.,Seemed in the general woe to weep.
34044,BOOK III.,"When the great sun, the lord of day,"
34045,BOOK III.,"Saw Rávan tear the dame away,"
34046,BOOK III.,His glorious light began to fail
34047,BOOK III.,And all his disk grew cold and pale.
34048,BOOK III.,"""If Rávan from the forest flies"
34049,BOOK III.,"With Ráma's Sítá as his prize,"
34050,BOOK III.,"Justice and truth have vanished hence,"
34051,BOOK III.,"Honour and right and innocence."""
34052,BOOK III.,Thus rose the cry of wild despair
34053,BOOK III.,From spirits as they gathered there.
34054,BOOK III.,In trembling troops in open lawns
34055,BOOK III.,"Wept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,"
34056,BOOK III.,And a strange terror changed the eyes
34057,BOOK III.,They lifted to the distant skies.
34058,BOOK III.,On silvan Gods who love the dell
34059,BOOK III.,"A sudden fear and trembling fell,"
34060,BOOK III.,As in the deepest woe they viewed
34061,BOOK III.,The lady by the fiend subdued.
34062,BOOK III.,Still in loud shrieks was heard afar
34063,BOOK III.,"That voice whose sweetness naught could mar,"
34064,BOOK III.,While eager looks of fear and woe
34065,BOOK III.,She bent upon the earth below.
34066,BOOK III.,The lady of each winning wile
34067,BOOK III.,"With pearly teeth and lovely smile,"
34068,BOOK III.,"Seized by the lord of Lanká's isle,"
34069,BOOK III.,Looked down for friends in vain.
34070,BOOK III.,"She saw no friend to aid her, none,"
34071,BOOK III.,Not Ráma nor the younger son
34072,BOOK III.,"Of Dasaratha, and undone"
34073,BOOK III.,She swooned with fear and pain.

34081,BOOK III.,Soon as the Maithil lady knew
34082,BOOK III.,"That high through air the giant flew,"
34083,BOOK III.,Distressed with grief and sore afraid
34084,BOOK III.,Her troubled spirit sank dismayed.
34085,BOOK III.,"Then, as anew the waters welled"
34086,BOOK III.,"From those red eyes which sorrow swelled,"
34087,BOOK III.,"Forth in keen words her passion broke,"
34088,BOOK III.,And to the fierce-eyed fiend she spoke:
34089,BOOK III.,"""Canst thou attempt a deed so base,"
34090,BOOK III.,"Untroubled by the deep disgrace,--"
34091,BOOK III.,"To steal me from my home and fly,"
34092,BOOK III.,When friend or guardian none was nigh?
34093,BOOK III.,"Thy craven soul that longed to steal,"
34094,BOOK III.,"Fearing the blows that warriors deal,"
34095,BOOK III.,Upon a magic deer relied
34096,BOOK III.,"To lure my husband from my side,"
34097,BOOK III.,"Friend of his sire, the vulture king"
34098,BOOK III.,"Lies low on earth with mangled wing,"
34099,BOOK III.,Who gave his aged life for me
34100,BOOK III.,And died for her he sought to free.
34101,BOOK III.,"Ah, glorious strength indeed is thine,"
34102,BOOK III.,"Thou meanest of thy giant line,"
34103,BOOK III.,Whose courage dared to tell thy name
34104,BOOK III.,And conquer in the fight a dame.
34105,BOOK III.,Does the vile deed that thou hast done
34106,BOOK III.,"Cause thee no shame, thou wicked one--"
34107,BOOK III.,A woman from her home to rend
34108,BOOK III.,When none was near his aid to lend?
34109,BOOK III.,"Through all the worlds, O giant King,"
34110,BOOK III.,"The tidings of this deed will ring,"
34111,BOOK III.,This deed in law and honour's spite
34112,BOOK III.,By one who claims a hero's might.
34113,BOOK III.,"Shame on thy boasted valour, shame!"
34114,BOOK III.,Thy prowess is an empty name.
34115,BOOK III.,"Shame, giant, on this cursed deed"
34116,BOOK III.,For which thy race is doomed to bleed!
34117,BOOK III.,"Thou fliest swifter than the gale,"
34118,BOOK III.,For what can strength like thine avail?
34119,BOOK III.,"Stay for one hour, O Rávan, stay;"
34120,BOOK III.,Thou shalt not flee with life away.
34121,BOOK III.,Soon as the royal chieftains' sight
34122,BOOK III.,"Falls on the thief who roams by night,"
34123,BOOK III.,"Thou wilt not, tyrant, live one hour"
34124,BOOK III.,Though backed by all thy legions' power.
34125,BOOK III.,Ne'er can thy puny strength sustain
34126,BOOK III.,The tempest of their arrowy rain:
34127,BOOK III.,Have e'er the trembling birds withstood
34128,BOOK III.,The wild flames raging in the wood?
34129,BOOK III.,"Hear me, O Rávan, let me go,"
34130,BOOK III.,And save thy soul from coming woe.
34131,BOOK III.,"Or if thou wilt not set me free,"
34132,BOOK III.,Wroth for this insult done to me.
34133,BOOK III.,With his brave brother's aid my lord
34134,BOOK III.,Against thy life will raise his sword.
34135,BOOK III.,A guilty hope inflames thy breast
34136,BOOK III.,His wife from Ráma's home to wrest.
34137,BOOK III.,"Ah fool, the hope thou hast is vain;"
34138,BOOK III.,Thy dreams of bliss shall end in pain.
34139,BOOK III.,If torn from all I love by thee
34140,BOOK III.,"My godlike lord no more I see,"
34141,BOOK III.,"Soon will I die and end my woes,"
34142,BOOK III.,Nor live the captive of my foes.
34143,BOOK III.,"Ah fool, with blinded eyes to choose"
34144,BOOK III.,The evil and the good refuse!
34145,BOOK III.,So the sick wretch with stubborn will
34146,BOOK III.,"Turns fondly to the cates that kill,"
34147,BOOK III.,And madly draws his lips away

34149,BOOK III.,About thy neck securely wound
34150,BOOK III.,"The deadly coil of Fate is bound,"
34151,BOOK III.,"And thou, O Rávan, dost not fear"
34152,BOOK III.,Although the hour of death is near.
34153,BOOK III.,With death-doomed sight thine eyes behold
34154,BOOK III.,"The gleaming of the trees of gold,--"
34155,BOOK III.,"See dread Vaitarani, the flood"
34156,BOOK III.,"That rolls a stream of foamy blood,--"
34157,BOOK III.,See the dark wood by all abhorred--
34158,BOOK III.,Its every leaf a threatening sword.
34159,BOOK III.,The tangled thickets thou shall tread
34160,BOOK III.,Where thorns with iron points are spread.
34161,BOOK III.,"For never can thy days be long,"
34162,BOOK III.,Base plotter of this shame and wrong
34163,BOOK III.,To Ráma of the lofty soul:
34164,BOOK III.,He dies who drinks the poisoned bowl.
34165,BOOK III.,The coils of death around thee lie:
34166,BOOK III.,They hold thee and thou canst not fly.
34167,BOOK III.,"Ah whither, tyrant, wouldst thou run"
34168,BOOK III.,The vengeance of my lord to shun?
34169,BOOK III.,By his unaided arm alone
34170,BOOK III.,Were twice seven thousand fiends o'erthrown:
34171,BOOK III.,"Yes, in the twinkling of an eye"
34172,BOOK III.,He forced thy mightiest fiends to die.
34173,BOOK III.,"And shall that lord of lion heart,"
34174,BOOK III.,"Skilled in the bow and spear and dart,"

34177,BOOK III.,
34178,BOOK III.,"These were her words, and more beside,"
34179,BOOK III.,By wrath and bitter hate supplied.
34180,BOOK III.,Then by her woe and fear o'erthrown
34181,BOOK III.,She wept again and made her moan.
34182,BOOK III.,"As long she wept in grief and dread,"
34183,BOOK III.,"Scarce conscious of the words she said,"
34184,BOOK III.,The wicked giant onward fled
34185,BOOK III.,And bore her through the air.
34186,BOOK III.,"As firm he held the Maithil dame,"
34187,BOOK III.,"Still wildly struggling, o'er her frame"
34188,BOOK III.,With grief and bitter misery came
34189,BOOK III.,The trembling of despair.

34197,BOOK III.,"He bore her on in rapid flight,"
34198,BOOK III.,And not a friend appeared in sight.
34199,BOOK III.,But on a hill that o'er the wood
34200,BOOK III.,Raised its high top five monkeys stood.
34201,BOOK III.,"From her fair neck her scarf she drew,"
34202,BOOK III.,And down the glittering vesture flew.
34203,BOOK III.,"With earring, necklet, chain, and gem,"
34204,BOOK III.,Descending in the midst of them:
34205,BOOK III.,"""For these,"" she thought, ""my path may show,"
34206,BOOK III.,"And tell my lord the way I go."""
34207,BOOK III.,"Nor did the fiend, in wild alarm,"
34208,BOOK III.,Mark when she drew from neck and arm
34209,BOOK III.,"And foot the gems and gold, and sent"
34210,BOOK III.,To earth each gleaming ornament.
34211,BOOK III.,The monkeys raised their tawny eyes
34212,BOOK III.,"That closed not in their first surprise,"
34213,BOOK III.,"And saw the dark-eyed lady, where"
34214,BOOK III.,She shrieked above them in the air.
34215,BOOK III.,High o'er their heads the giant passed
34216,BOOK III.,Holding the weeping lady fast.
34217,BOOK III.,O'er Pampa's flashing flood he sped
34218,BOOK III.,And on to Lanká's city fled.
34219,BOOK III.,He bore away in senseless joy
34220,BOOK III.,"The prize that should his life destroy,"
34221,BOOK III.,Like the rash fool who hugs beneath
34222,BOOK III.,His robe a snake with venomed teeth.
34223,BOOK III.,"Swift as an arrow from a bow,"
34224,BOOK III.,"Speeding o'er lands that lay below,"
34225,BOOK III.,Sublime in air his course he took
34226,BOOK III.,O'er wood and rock and lake and brook.
34227,BOOK III.,He passed at length the sounding sea
34228,BOOK III.,"Where monstrous creatures wander free,--"
34229,BOOK III.,"Seat of Lord Varun's ancient reign,"
34230,BOOK III.,Controller of the eternal main.
34231,BOOK III.,The angry waves were raised and tossed
34232,BOOK III.,"As Rávan with the lady crossed,"
34233,BOOK III.,And fish and snake in wild unrest
34234,BOOK III.,Showed flashing fin and gleaming crest.
34235,BOOK III.,Then from the blessed troops who dwell
34236,BOOK III.,In air celestial voices fell:
34237,BOOK III.,"""O ten-necked King,"" they cried, ""attend:"
34238,BOOK III.,"This guilty deed will bring thine end."""
34239,BOOK III.,
34240,BOOK III.,"Then Rávan speeding like the storm,"
34241,BOOK III.,"Bearing his death in human form,"
34242,BOOK III.,"The struggling Sítá, lighted down"
34243,BOOK III.,In royal Lanká's glorious town;
34244,BOOK III.,"A city bright and rich, that showed"
34245,BOOK III.,Well-ordered street and noble road;
34246,BOOK III.,"Arranged with just division, fair"
34247,BOOK III.,With multitudes in court and square.
34248,BOOK III.,"Thus, all his journey done, he passed"
34249,BOOK III.,Within his royal home at last.
34250,BOOK III.,There in a queenly bower he placed
34251,BOOK III.,The black-eyed dame with dainty waist:
34252,BOOK III.,Thus in her chamber Máyá laid
34253,BOOK III.,"The lovely Máyá, demon maid."
34254,BOOK III.,Then Rávan gave command to all
34255,BOOK III.,The dread she-fiends who filled the hall:
34256,BOOK III.,"""This captive lady watch and guard"
34257,BOOK III.,From sight of man and woman barred.
34258,BOOK III.,But all the fair one asks beside
34259,BOOK III.,Be with unsparing hand supplied:
34260,BOOK III.,"As though 'twere I that asked, withhold"
34261,BOOK III.,No pearls or dress or gems or gold.
34262,BOOK III.,And she among you that shall dare
34263,BOOK III.,Of purpose or through want of care
34264,BOOK III.,"One word to vex her soul to say,"
34265,BOOK III.,"Throws her unvalued life away."""
34266,BOOK III.,
34267,BOOK III.,Thus spake the monarch of their race
34268,BOOK III.,"To those she-fiends who thronged the place,"
34269,BOOK III.,And pondering on the course to take
34270,BOOK III.,Went from the chamber as he spake.
34271,BOOK III.,"He saw eight giants, strong and dread,"
34272,BOOK III.,"On flesh of bleeding victims fed,"
34273,BOOK III.,"Proud in the boon which Brahmá gave,"
34274,BOOK III.,And trusting in its power to save.
34275,BOOK III.,He thus the mighty chiefs addressed
34276,BOOK III.,Of glorious power and strength possessed:
34277,BOOK III.,"""Arm, warriors, with the spear and bow;"
34278,BOOK III.,"With all your speed from Lanká go,"
34279,BOOK III.,"For Janasthán, our own no more,"
34280,BOOK III.,Is now defiled with giants' gore;
34281,BOOK III.,The seat of Khara's royal state
34282,BOOK III.,Is left unto us desolate.
34283,BOOK III.,"In your brave hearts and might confide,"
34284,BOOK III.,And cast ignoble fear aside.
34285,BOOK III.,"Go, in that desert region dwell"
34286,BOOK III.,Where the fierce giants fought and fell.
34287,BOOK III.,"A glorious host that region held,"
34288,BOOK III.,"For power and might unparalleled,"
34289,BOOK III.,"By Dúshan and brave Khara led,--"
34290,BOOK III.,"All, slain by Ráma's arrows, bled."
34291,BOOK III.,Hence boundless wrath that spurns control
34292,BOOK III.,"Reigns paramount within my soul,"
34293,BOOK III.,And naught but Ráma's death can sate
34294,BOOK III.,The fury of my vengeful hate.
34295,BOOK III.,I will not close my slumbering eyes
34296,BOOK III.,Till by this hand my foeman dies.
34297,BOOK III.,And when mine arm has slain the foe
34298,BOOK III.,"Who laid those giant princes low,"
34299,BOOK III.,"Long will I triumph in the deed,"
34300,BOOK III.,Like one enriched in utmost need.
34301,BOOK III.,"Now go; that I this end may gain,"
34302,BOOK III.,"In Janasthán, O chiefs, remain."
34303,BOOK III.,"Watch Ráma there with keenest eye,"
34304,BOOK III.,And all his deeds and movements spy.
34305,BOOK III.,"Go forth, no helping art neglect,"
34306,BOOK III.,"Be brave and prompt and circumspect,"
34307,BOOK III.,And be your one endeavour still
34308,BOOK III.,To aid mine arm this foe to kill.
34309,BOOK III.,Oft have I seen your warrior might
34310,BOOK III.,"Proved in the forehead of the fight,"
34311,BOOK III.,And sure of strength I know so well
34312,BOOK III.,"Send you in Janasthán to dwell."""
34313,BOOK III.,The giants heard with prompt assent
34314,BOOK III.,"The pleasant words he said,"
34315,BOOK III.,And each before his master bent
34316,BOOK III.,"For meet salute, his head."
34317,BOOK III.,"Then as he bade, without delay,"
34318,BOOK III.,"From Lanká's gate they passed,"
34319,BOOK III.,And hurried forward on their way

34327,BOOK III.,
34328,BOOK III.,Thus Rávan his commandment gave
34329,BOOK III.,"To those eight giants strong and brave,"
34330,BOOK III.,So thinking in his foolish pride
34331,BOOK III.,Against all dangers to provide.
34332,BOOK III.,Then with his wounded heart aflame
34333,BOOK III.,"With love he thought upon the dame,"
34334,BOOK III.,And took with hasty steps the way
34335,BOOK III.,To the fair chamber where she lay.
34336,BOOK III.,He saw the gentle lady there
34337,BOOK III.,"Weighed down by woe too great to bear,"
34338,BOOK III.,Amid the throng of fiends who kept
34339,BOOK III.,Their watch around her as she wept:
34340,BOOK III.,A pinnace sinking neath the wave
34341,BOOK III.,When mighty winds around her rave:
34342,BOOK III.,"A lonely herd-forsaken deer,"
34343,BOOK III.,When hungry dogs are pressing near.
34344,BOOK III.,Within the bower the giant passed:
34345,BOOK III.,Her mournful looks were downward cast.
34346,BOOK III.,As there she lay with streaming eyes
34347,BOOK III.,"The giant bade the lady rise,"
34348,BOOK III.,And to the shrinking captive showed
34349,BOOK III.,"The glories of his rich abode,"
34350,BOOK III.,Where thousand women spent their days
34351,BOOK III.,In palaces with gold ablaze;
34352,BOOK III.,"Where wandered birds of every sort,"
34353,BOOK III.,And jewels flashed in hall and court.
34354,BOOK III.,Where noble pillars charmed the sight
34355,BOOK III.,"With diamond and lazulite,"
34356,BOOK III.,And others glorious to behold
34357,BOOK III.,"With ivory, crystal, silver, gold."
34358,BOOK III.,"There swelled on high the tambour's sound,"
34359,BOOK III.,And burnished ore was bright around
34360,BOOK III.,He led the mournful lady where
34361,BOOK III.,"Resplendent gold adorned the stair,"
34362,BOOK III.,And showed each lattice fair to see
34363,BOOK III.,With silver work and ivory:
34364,BOOK III.,"Showed his bright chambers, line on line,"
34365,BOOK III.,Adorned with nets of golden twine.
34366,BOOK III.,Beyond he showed the Maithil dame
34367,BOOK III.,"His gardens bright as lightning's flame,"
34368,BOOK III.,And many a pool and lake he showed
34369,BOOK III.,Where blooms of gayest colour glowed.
34370,BOOK III.,Through all his home from view to view
34371,BOOK III.,The lady sunk in grief he drew.
34372,BOOK III.,Then trusting in her heart to wake
34373,BOOK III.,"Desire of all she saw, he spake:"
34374,BOOK III.,"""Three hundred million giants, all"
34375,BOOK III.,"Obedient to their master's call,"
34376,BOOK III.,"Not counting young and weak and old,"
34377,BOOK III.,Serve me with spirits fierce and bold.
34378,BOOK III.,A thousand culled from all of these
34379,BOOK III.,Wait on the lord they long to please.
34380,BOOK III.,"This glorious power, this pomp and sway,"
34381,BOOK III.,"Dear lady, at thy feet I lay:"
34382,BOOK III.,"Yea, with my life I give the whole,"
34383,BOOK III.,O dearer than my life and soul.
34384,BOOK III.,A thousand beauties fill my hall:
34385,BOOK III.,Be thou my wife and rule them all.
34386,BOOK III.,O hear my supplication! why
34387,BOOK III.,This reasonable prayer deny?
34388,BOOK III.,"Some pity to thy suitor show,"
34389,BOOK III.,For love's hot flames within me glow.
34390,BOOK III.,"This isle a hundred leagues in length,"
34391,BOOK III.,"Encompassed by the ocean's strength,"
34392,BOOK III.,Would all the Gods and fiends defy
34393,BOOK III.,Though led by Him who rules the sky.

34403,BOOK III.,And wed thee with a worthier mate.
34404,BOOK III.,"My timid love, enjoy with me"
34405,BOOK III.,The prime of youth before it flee.
34406,BOOK III.,Do not one hour the hope retain
34407,BOOK III.,To look on Ráma's face again.
34408,BOOK III.,For whom would wildest thought beguile
34409,BOOK III.,To seek thee in the giants' isle?
34410,BOOK III.,Say who is he has power to bind
34411,BOOK III.,In toils of net the rushing wind.
34412,BOOK III.,Whose is the mighty hand will tame
34413,BOOK III.,And hold the glory of the flame?
34414,BOOK III.,"In all the worlds above, below,"
34415,BOOK III.,"Not one, O fair of form, I know"
34416,BOOK III.,Who from this isle in fight could rend
34417,BOOK III.,The lady whom these arms defend.
34418,BOOK III.,"Fair Queen, o'er Lanká's island reign,"
34419,BOOK III.,Sole mistress of the wide domain.

34431,BOOK III.,With gorgeous hues and scent divine.
34432,BOOK III.,Take gold and gems and rich attire:
34433,BOOK III.,Enjoy with me thy heart's desire.
34434,BOOK III.,"There stand, of chariots far the best,"
34435,BOOK III.,The car my brother once possessed.
34436,BOOK III.,"Which, victor in the stricken field,"
34437,BOOK III.,I forced the Lord of Gold to yield.
34438,BOOK III.,"'Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,"
34439,BOOK III.,Bright as the sun and swift as thought.
34440,BOOK III.,"Therein O Sítá, shalt thou ride"
34441,BOOK III.,Delighted by thy lover's side.
34442,BOOK III.,But sorrow mars with lingering trace
34443,BOOK III.,The splendour of thy lotus face.
34444,BOOK III.,"A cloud of woe is o'er it spread,"
34445,BOOK III.,"And all the light of joy is fled."""
34446,BOOK III.,
34447,BOOK III.,"The lady, by her woe distressed,"
34448,BOOK III.,One corner of her raiment pressed
34449,BOOK III.,"To her sad cheek like moonlight clear,"
34450,BOOK III.,And wiped away a falling tear.
34451,BOOK III.,The rover of the night renewed
34452,BOOK III.,His eager pleading as he viewed
34453,BOOK III.,"The lady stand like one distraught,"
34454,BOOK III.,Striving to fix her wandering thought:
34455,BOOK III.,
34456,BOOK III.,"""Think not, sweet lady, of the shame"
34457,BOOK III.,"Of broken vows, nor fear the blame."
34458,BOOK III.,The saints approve with favouring eyes
34459,BOOK III.,This union knit with marriage ties.
34460,BOOK III.,"O beauty, at thy radiant feet"
34461,BOOK III.,"I lay my heads, and thus entreat."
34462,BOOK III.,"One word of grace, one look I crave:"

34464,BOOK III.,"These idle words I speak are vain,"
34465,BOOK III.,"Wrung forth by love's consuming pain,"
34466,BOOK III.,And ne'er of Rávan be it said
34467,BOOK III.,"He wooed a dame with prostrate head."""
34468,BOOK III.,Thus to the Maithil lady sued
34469,BOOK III.,"The monarch of the giant brood,"
34470,BOOK III.,"And ""She is now mine own,"" he thought,"
34471,BOOK III.,In Death's dire coils already caught.

34480,BOOK III.,Oppressed by woe but undeterred.
34481,BOOK III.,"Fear of the fiend she cast aside,"
34482,BOOK III.,And thus in noble scorn replied:
34483,BOOK III.,"""His word of honour never stained"
34484,BOOK III.,"King Dasaratha nobly reigned,"
34485,BOOK III.,"The bridge of right, the friend of truth."
34486,BOOK III.,"His eldest son, a noble youth,"
34487,BOOK III.,"Is Ráma, virtue's faithful friend,"
34488,BOOK III.,Whose glories through the worlds extend.
34489,BOOK III.,"Long arms and large full eyes has he,"
34490,BOOK III.,"My husband, yea a God to me."
34491,BOOK III.,"With shoulders like the forest king's,"
34492,BOOK III.,From old Ikshváku's line he springs.
34493,BOOK III.,He with his brother Lakshman's aid
34494,BOOK III.,Will smite thee with the vengeful blade.
34495,BOOK III.,Hadst thou but dared before his eyes
34496,BOOK III.,"To lay thine hand upon the prize,"
34497,BOOK III.,Thou stretched before his feet hadst lain
34498,BOOK III.,In Janasthán like Khara slain.
34499,BOOK III.,Thy boasted rovers of the night
34500,BOOK III.,"With hideous shapes and giant might,--"
34501,BOOK III.,Like serpents when the feathered king
34502,BOOK III.,"Swoops down with his tremendous wing,--"
34503,BOOK III.,Will find their useless venom fail
34504,BOOK III.,When Ráma's mighty arms assail.
34505,BOOK III.,"The rapid arrows bright with gold,"
34506,BOOK III.,"Shot from the bow he loves to hold,"
34507,BOOK III.,Will rend thy frame from flank to flank
34508,BOOK III.,As Gangá's waves erode the bank.
34509,BOOK III.,Though neither God nor fiend have power
34510,BOOK III.,"To slay thee in the battle hour,"
34511,BOOK III.,"Yet from his hand shall come thy fate,"
34512,BOOK III.,Struck down before his vengeful hate.
34513,BOOK III.,That mighty lord will strike and end
34514,BOOK III.,The days of life thou hast to spend.
34515,BOOK III.,"Thy days are doomed, thy life is sped"
34516,BOOK III.,Like victims to the pillar led.
34517,BOOK III.,"Yea, if the glance of Ráma bright"
34518,BOOK III.,"With fury on thy form should light,"
34519,BOOK III.,Thou scorched this day wouldst fall and die
34520,BOOK III.,Like Káma slain by Rudra's eye.(506)
34521,BOOK III.,"He who from heaven the moon could throw,"
34522,BOOK III.,"Or bid its bright rays cease to glow,--"
34523,BOOK III.,He who could drain the mighty sea
34524,BOOK III.,Will set his darling Sítá free.
34525,BOOK III.,"Fled is thy life, thy glory, fled"
34526,BOOK III.,Thy strength and power: each sense is dead.
34527,BOOK III.,Soon Lanká widowed by thy guilt
34528,BOOK III.,Will see the blood of giants spilt.
34529,BOOK III.,"This wicked deed, O cruel King,"
34530,BOOK III.,"No triumph, no delight will bring."
34531,BOOK III.,Thou with outrageous might and scorn
34532,BOOK III.,A woman from her lord hast torn.
34533,BOOK III.,"My glorious husband far away,"
34534,BOOK III.,"Making heroic strength his stay,"
34535,BOOK III.,"Dwells with his brother, void of fear,"
34536,BOOK III.,In Dandak forest lone and drear.
34537,BOOK III.,No more in force of arms confide:
34538,BOOK III.,"That haughty strength, that power and pride"
34539,BOOK III.,My hero with his arrowy rain
34540,BOOK III.,From all thy bleeding limbs will drain.
34541,BOOK III.,"When urged by fate's dire mandate, nigh"
34542,BOOK III.,Comes the fixt hour for men to die.
34543,BOOK III.,"Caught in Death's toils their eyes are blind,"
34544,BOOK III.,And folly takes each wandering mind.
34545,BOOK III.,So for the outrage thou hast done
34546,BOOK III.,"The fate is near thou canst not shun,--"
34547,BOOK III.,The fate that on thyself and all
34548,BOOK III.,Thy giants and thy town shall fall.
34549,BOOK III.,I spurn thee: can the altar dight
34550,BOOK III.,"With vessels for the sacred rite,"
34551,BOOK III.,"O'er which the priest his prayer has said,"
34552,BOOK III.,Be sullied by an outcaste's tread?
34553,BOOK III.,"So me, the consort dear and true"
34554,BOOK III.,"Of him who clings to virtue too,"
34555,BOOK III.,"Thy hated touch shall ne'er defile,"
34556,BOOK III.,Base tyrant lord of Lanká's isle.
34557,BOOK III.,Can the white swan who floats in pride
34558,BOOK III.,"Through lilies by her consort's side,"
34559,BOOK III.,"Look for one moment, as they pass,"
34560,BOOK III.,On the poor diver in the grass?
34561,BOOK III.,"This senseless body waits thy will,"
34562,BOOK III.,"To torture, chain, to wound or kill."
34563,BOOK III.,"I will not, King of giants, strive"
34564,BOOK III.,To keep this fleeting soul alive
34565,BOOK III.,But never shall they join the name
34566,BOOK III.,"Of Sítá with reproach and shame."""
34567,BOOK III.,
34568,BOOK III.,Thus as her breast with fury burned
34569,BOOK III.,Her bitter speech the dame returned.
34570,BOOK III.,"Such words of rage and scorn, the last"
34571,BOOK III.,"She uttered, at the fiend she cast."
34572,BOOK III.,"Her taunting speech the giant heard,"
34573,BOOK III.,And every hair with anger stirred.
34574,BOOK III.,Then thus with fury in his eye
34575,BOOK III.,He made in threats his fierce reply:
34576,BOOK III.,"""Hear Maithil lady, hear my speech:"
34577,BOOK III.,List to my words and ponder each.
34578,BOOK III.,If o'er thy head twelve months shall fly
34579,BOOK III.,"And thou thy love wilt still deny,"
34580,BOOK III.,My cooks shall mince thy flesh with steel
34581,BOOK III.,"And serve it for my morning meal."""
34582,BOOK III.,
34583,BOOK III.,Thus with terrific threats to her
34584,BOOK III.,"Spake Rávan, cruel ravener."
34585,BOOK III.,Mad with the rage her answer woke
34586,BOOK III.,He called the fiendish train and spoke:
34587,BOOK III.,"""Take her, ye Rákshas dames, who fright"
34588,BOOK III.,"With hideous form and mien the sight,"
34589,BOOK III.,"Who make the flesh of men your food,--"
34590,BOOK III.,"And let her pride be soon subdued."""
34591,BOOK III.,"He spoke, and at his word the band"
34592,BOOK III.,Of fiendish monsters raised each hand
34593,BOOK III.,"In reverence to the giant king,"
34594,BOOK III.,And pressed round Sítá in a ring.
34595,BOOK III.,Rávan once more with stern behest
34596,BOOK III.,To those she-fiends his speech addressed:
34597,BOOK III.,"Shaking the earth beneath his tread,"
34598,BOOK III.,He stamped his furious foot and said:
34599,BOOK III.,"""To the Asoka garden bear"
34600,BOOK III.,"The dame, and guard her safely there"
34601,BOOK III.,Until her stubborn pride be bent
34602,BOOK III.,By mingled threat and blandishment.
34603,BOOK III.,"See that ye watch her well, and tame,"
34604,BOOK III.,"Like some she-elephant, the dame."""
34605,BOOK III.,
34606,BOOK III.,They led her to that garden where
34607,BOOK III.,"The sweetest flowers perfumed the air,"
34608,BOOK III.,"Where bright trees bore each rarest fruit,"
34609,BOOK III.,"And birds, enamoured, ne'er were mute."
34610,BOOK III.,"Bowed down with terror and distress,"
34611,BOOK III.,"Watched by each cruel giantess,--"
34612,BOOK III.,Like a poor solitary deer
34613,BOOK III.,"When ravening tigresses are near,--"
34614,BOOK III.,The hapless lady lay distraught
34615,BOOK III.,"Like some wild thing but newly caught,"
34616,BOOK III.,"And found no solace, no relief"
34617,BOOK III.,From agonizing fear and grief;
34618,BOOK III.,Not for one moment could forget
34619,BOOK III.,"Each terrifying word and threat,"
34620,BOOK III.,Or the fierce eyes upon her set
34621,BOOK III.,By those who watched around.
34622,BOOK III.,"She thought of Ráma far away,"
34623,BOOK III.,She mourned for Lakshman as she lay
34624,BOOK III.,In grief and terror and dismay

34630,BOOK III.,Canto LVII. Sítá Comforted.
34631,BOOK III.,
34632,BOOK III.,
34633,BOOK III.,Soon as the fiend had set her down
34634,BOOK III.,Within his home in Lanká's town
34635,BOOK III.,"Triumph and joy filled Indra's breast,"
34636,BOOK III.,Whom thus the Eternal Sire addressed:
34637,BOOK III.,
34638,BOOK III.,"""This deed will free the worlds from woe"
34639,BOOK III.,And cause the giants' overthrow.
34640,BOOK III.,The fiend has borne to Lanká's isle
34641,BOOK III.,"The lady of the lovely smile,"
34642,BOOK III.,True consort born to happy fate
34643,BOOK III.,With features fair and delicate.
34644,BOOK III.,"She looks and longs for Ráma's face,"
34645,BOOK III.,"But sees a crowd of demon race,"
34646,BOOK III.,And guarded by the giant's train
34647,BOOK III.,Pines for her lord and weeps in vain.
34648,BOOK III.,But Lanká founded on a steep
34649,BOOK III.,"Is girdled by the mighty deep,"
34650,BOOK III.,And how will Ráma know his fair
34651,BOOK III.,And blameless wife is prisoned there?
34652,BOOK III.,She on her woe will sadly brood
34653,BOOK III.,"And pine away in solitude,"
34654,BOOK III.,"And heedless of herself, will cease"
34655,BOOK III.,"To live, despairing of release."
34656,BOOK III.,"Yes, pondering on her fate, I see"
34657,BOOK III.,Her gentle life in jeopardy.
34658,BOOK III.,"Go, Indra, swiftly seek the place,"
34659,BOOK III.,And look upon her lovely face.
34660,BOOK III.,Within the city make thy way:
34661,BOOK III.,"Let heavenly food her spirit stay."""
34662,BOOK III.,
34663,BOOK III.,Thus Brahma spake: and He who slew
34664,BOOK III.,"The cruel demon Páka, flew"
34665,BOOK III.,"Where Lanká's royal city lay,"
34666,BOOK III.,And Sleep went with him on his way.
34667,BOOK III.,"""Sleep,"" cried the heavenly Monarch, ""close"
34668,BOOK III.,"Each giant's eye in deep repose."""
34669,BOOK III.,
34670,BOOK III.,"Thus Indra spoke, and Sleep fulfilled"
34671,BOOK III.,"With joy his mandate, as he willed,"
34672,BOOK III.,"To aid the plan the Gods proposed,"
34673,BOOK III.,The demons' eyes in sleep she closed.
34674,BOOK III.,"Then Sachí's lord, the Thousand-eyed,"
34675,BOOK III.,To the Asoka garden hied.
34676,BOOK III.,"He came and stood where Sítá lay,"
34677,BOOK III.,And gently thus began to say:
34678,BOOK III.,"""Lord of the Gods who hold the sky,"
34679,BOOK III.,"Dame of the lovely smile, am I."
34680,BOOK III.,"Weep no more, lady, weep no more;"
34681,BOOK III.,Thy days of woe will soon be o'er.
34682,BOOK III.,"I come, O Janak's child, to be"
34683,BOOK III.,The helper of thy lord and thee.
34684,BOOK III.,"He through my grace, with hosts to aid,"
34685,BOOK III.,This sea-girt land will soon invade.
34686,BOOK III.,'Tis by my art that slumbers close
34687,BOOK III.,The eyelids of thy giant foes.
34688,BOOK III.,"Now I, with Sleep, this place have sought,"
34689,BOOK III.,"Videhan lady, and have brought"
34690,BOOK III.,A gift of heaven's ambrosial food
34691,BOOK III.,To stay thee in thy solitude.
34692,BOOK III.,"Receive it from my hand, and taste,"
34693,BOOK III.,O lady of the dainty waist:
34694,BOOK III.,For countless ages thou shall be
34695,BOOK III.,"From pangs of thirst and hunger free."""
34696,BOOK III.,
34697,BOOK III.,But doubt within her bosom woke
34698,BOOK III.,As to the Lord of Gods she spoke:
34699,BOOK III.,"""How may I know for truth that thou"
34700,BOOK III.,Whose form I see before me now
34701,BOOK III.,Art verily the King adored
34702,BOOK III.,"By heavenly Gods, and Sachí's lord?"
34703,BOOK III.,With Raghu's sons I learnt to know
34704,BOOK III.,The certain signs which Godhead show.
34705,BOOK III.,These marks before mine eyes display
34706,BOOK III.,"If o'er the Gods thou bear the sway."""
34707,BOOK III.,
34708,BOOK III.,"The heavenly lord of Sachí heard,"
34709,BOOK III.,And did according to her word.
34710,BOOK III.,Above the ground his feet were raised;
34711,BOOK III.,With eyelids motionless he gazed.
34712,BOOK III.,"No dust upon his raiment lay,"
34713,BOOK III.,And his bright wreath was fresh and gay.
34714,BOOK III.,Nor was the lady's glad heart slow
34715,BOOK III.,"The Monarch of the Gods to know,"
34716,BOOK III.,And while the tears unceasing ran
34717,BOOK III.,From her sweet eyes she thus began:
34718,BOOK III.,"""My lord has gained a friend in thee,"
34719,BOOK III.,And I this day thy presence see
34720,BOOK III.,"Shown clearly to mine eyes, as when"
34721,BOOK III.,"Ráma and Lakshman, lords of men,"
34722,BOOK III.,"Beheld it, and their sire the king,"
34723,BOOK III.,And Janak too from whom I spring.
34724,BOOK III.,"Now I, O Monarch of the Blest,"
34725,BOOK III.,"Will eat this food at thy behest,"
34726,BOOK III.,"Which thou hast brought me, of thy grace,"
34727,BOOK III.,"To aid and strengthen Raghu's race."""
34728,BOOK III.,
34729,BOOK III.,"She spoke, and by his words relieved,"
34730,BOOK III.,"The food from Indra's hand received,"
34731,BOOK III.,"Yet ere she ate the balm he brought,"
34732,BOOK III.,On Lakshman and her lord she thought.
34733,BOOK III.,"""If my brave lord be still alive,"
34734,BOOK III.,"If valiant Lakshman yet survive,"
34735,BOOK III.,May this my taste of heavenly food
34736,BOOK III.,"Bring health to them and bliss renewed!"""
34737,BOOK III.,"She ate, and that celestial food"
34738,BOOK III.,"Stayed hunger, thirst, and lassitude,"
34739,BOOK III.,And all her strength restored.
34740,BOOK III.,Great joy her hopeful spirit stirred
34741,BOOK III.,At the glad tidings newly heard
34742,BOOK III.,Of Lakshman and her lord.
34743,BOOK III.,And Indra's heart was joyful too:
34744,BOOK III.,"He bade the Maithil dame adieu,"
34745,BOOK III.,His saving errand done.
34746,BOOK III.,With Sleep beside him parting thence
34747,BOOK III.,He sought his heavenly residence

34761,BOOK III.,"To look upon his spouse again,"
34762,BOOK III.,Behind him from a thicket nigh
34763,BOOK III.,Rang out a jackal's piercing cry.
34764,BOOK III.,Alarmed he heard the startling shriek
34765,BOOK III.,"That raised his hair and dimmed his cheek,"
34766,BOOK III.,And all his heart was filled with doubt
34767,BOOK III.,As the shrill jackal's cry rang out:
34768,BOOK III.,"""Alas, some dire disaster seems"
34769,BOOK III.,Portended by the jackal's screams.
34770,BOOK III.,O may the Maithil dame be screened

34777,BOOK III.,And quit the dame to succour me.
34778,BOOK III.,Too well I see the demon band
34779,BOOK III.,The slaughter of my love have planned.
34780,BOOK III.,Me far from home and Sítá's view
34781,BOOK III.,The seeming deer Márícha drew.
34782,BOOK III.,He led me far through brake and dell
34783,BOOK III.,"Till wounded by my shaft he fell,"
34784,BOOK III.,"And as he sank rang out his cry,"
34785,BOOK III.,"""O save me, Lakshman, or I die."""
34786,BOOK III.,May it be well with both who stayed
34787,BOOK III.,"In the great wood with none to aid,"
34788,BOOK III.,For every fiend is now my foe
34789,BOOK III.,"For Janasthán's great overthrow,"
34790,BOOK III.,And many an omen seen to-day
34791,BOOK III.,"Has filled my heart with sore dismay."""
34792,BOOK III.,
34793,BOOK III.,Such were the thoughts and sad surmise
34794,BOOK III.,"Of Ráma at the jackal's cries,"
34795,BOOK III.,And all his heart within him burned
34796,BOOK III.,As to his cot his steps he turned.
34797,BOOK III.,He pondered on the deer that led
34798,BOOK III.,"His feet to follow where it fled,"
34799,BOOK III.,And sad with many a bitter thought
34800,BOOK III.,His home in Janasthán he sought.
34801,BOOK III.,His soul was dark with woe and fear
34802,BOOK III.,When flocks of birds and troops of deer
34803,BOOK III.,"Move round him from the left, and raised"
34804,BOOK III.,Discordant voices as they gazed.
34805,BOOK III.,The omens which the chieftain viewed
34806,BOOK III.,"The terror of his soul renewed,"
34807,BOOK III.,"When lo, to meet him Lakshman sped"
34808,BOOK III.,With brows whence all the light had fled.
34809,BOOK III.,"Near and more near the princes came,"
34810,BOOK III.,Each brother's heart and look the same;
34811,BOOK III.,Alike on each sad visage lay
34812,BOOK III.,"The signs of misery and dismay,"
34813,BOOK III.,Then Ráma by his terror moved
34814,BOOK III.,His brother for his fault reproved
34815,BOOK III.,In leaving Sítá far from aid
34816,BOOK III.,In the wild wood where giants strayed.
34817,BOOK III.,"Lakshman's left hand he took, and then"

34830,BOOK III.,"O Lakshman, may we yet return"
34831,BOOK III.,The safety of my love to learn.
34832,BOOK III.,To find the child of Janak still
34833,BOOK III.,Alive and free from scathe and ill!

34840,BOOK III.,That semblance of a golden deer
34841,BOOK III.,"Allured me far away,"
34842,BOOK III.,"I followed nearer and more near,"
34843,BOOK III.,And longed to take the prey.
34844,BOOK III.,I followed where the quarry fled:
34845,BOOK III.,"My deadly arrow flew,"
34846,BOOK III.,"And as the dying creature bled,"
34847,BOOK III.,The giant met my view.
34848,BOOK III.,Great fear and pain oppress my heart

34850,BOOK III.,And through my left eye keenly dart
34851,BOOK III.,The throbs that herald woe.

34880,BOOK III.,"In splendour fair as virgin ore,"
34881,BOOK III.,The lordship of the skies and earth
34882,BOOK III.,To me were prize of little worth.
34883,BOOK III.,"Ah, lives she yet, the Maithil dame,"
34884,BOOK III.,Dear as the soul within this frame?
34885,BOOK III.,"O, let not all my toil be vain,"
34886,BOOK III.,"The banishment, the woe and pain!"
34887,BOOK III.,"O, let not dark Kaikeyí win"
34888,BOOK III.,"The guerdon of her treacherous sin,"
34889,BOOK III.,"If, Sítá lost, my days I end,"
34890,BOOK III.,And thou without me homeward wend!
34891,BOOK III.,"O, let not good Kausalyá shed"
34892,BOOK III.,"Her bitter tears to mourn me dead,"
34893,BOOK III.,"Nor her proud rival's hest obey,"
34894,BOOK III.,Strong in her son and queenly sway!
34895,BOOK III.,Back to my cot will I repair
34896,BOOK III.,"If Sítá live to greet me there,"
34897,BOOK III.,"But if my wife have perished, I"
34898,BOOK III.,Reft of my love will surely die.

34900,BOOK III.,Look for my love and find her not
34901,BOOK III.,"Sweet welcome with her smile to give,"
34902,BOOK III.,"I tell thee, I will cease to live."
34903,BOOK III.,"O answer,--let thy words be plain,--"
34904,BOOK III.,"Lives Sítá yet, or is she slain?"
34905,BOOK III.,Didst thou thy sacred trust betray
34906,BOOK III.,Till ravening giants seized the prey?
34907,BOOK III.,"Ah me, so young, so soft and fair,"
34908,BOOK III.,"Lapped in all bliss, untried by care,"
34909,BOOK III.,"Rent from her own dear husband, how"
34910,BOOK III.,Will she support her misery now?
34911,BOOK III.,"That voice, O Lakshman smote thine ear,"
34912,BOOK III.,"And filled, I ween, thy heart with fear,"
34913,BOOK III.,When on thy name for succour cried
34914,BOOK III.,The treacherous giant ere he died.
34915,BOOK III.,"That voice too like mine own, I ween,"
34916,BOOK III.,Was heard by the Videhan queen.
34917,BOOK III.,"She bade thee seek my side to aid,"
34918,BOOK III.,"And quickly was the hest obeyed,"
34919,BOOK III.,"But ah, thy fault I needs must blame,"
34920,BOOK III.,"To leave alone the helpless dame,"
34921,BOOK III.,And let the cruel giants sate
34922,BOOK III.,The fury of their murderous hate.
34923,BOOK III.,Those blood-devouring demons all
34924,BOOK III.,"Grieve in their souls for Khara's fall,"
34925,BOOK III.,"And Sítá, none to guard her side,"
34926,BOOK III.,Torn by their cruel hands has died.
34927,BOOK III.,"I sink, O tamer of thy foes,"
34928,BOOK III.,Deep in the sea of whelming woes.
34929,BOOK III.,What can I now? I must endure
34930,BOOK III.,"The mighty grief that mocks at cure."""
34931,BOOK III.,
34932,BOOK III.,"Thus, all his thoughts on Sítá bent,"
34933,BOOK III.,"To Janasthán the chieftain went,"
34934,BOOK III.,"Hastening on with eager stride,"
34935,BOOK III.,And Lakshman hurried by his side.
34936,BOOK III.,"With toil and thirst and hunger worn,"
34937,BOOK III.,"His breast with doubt and anguish torn,"
34938,BOOK III.,He sought the well-known spot.
34939,BOOK III.,"Again, again he turned to chide"
34940,BOOK III.,With quivering lips which terror dried:
34941,BOOK III.,"He looked, and found her not."
34942,BOOK III.,"Within his leafy home he sped,"
34943,BOOK III.,Each pleasant spot he visited
34944,BOOK III.,Where oft his darling strayed.
34945,BOOK III.,"""'Tis as I feared,"" he cried, and there,"
34946,BOOK III.,"Yielding to pangs too great to bear,"
34947,BOOK III.,He sank by grief dismayed.

34956,BOOK III.,"His brother for untimely aid,"
34957,BOOK III.,"And thus, while anguish wrung his breast,"
34958,BOOK III.,The chief with eager question pressed:
34959,BOOK III.,"""Why, Lakshman, didst thou hurry hence"
34960,BOOK III.,And leave my wife without defence?
34961,BOOK III.,"I left her in the wood with thee,"
34962,BOOK III.,And deemed her safe from jeopardy.
34963,BOOK III.,"When first thy form appeared in view,"
34964,BOOK III.,I marked that Sítá came not too.
34965,BOOK III.,"With woe my troubled soul was rent,"
34966,BOOK III.,Prophetic of the dire event.
34967,BOOK III.,"Thy coming steps afar I spied,"
34968,BOOK III.,"I saw no Sítá by thy side,"
34969,BOOK III.,And felt a sudden throbbing dart
34970,BOOK III.,"Through my left eye, and arm, and heart."""
34971,BOOK III.,
34972,BOOK III.,"Lakshman, with Fortune's marks impressed,"
34973,BOOK III.,His brother mournfully addressed:
34974,BOOK III.,"""Not by my heart's free impulse led,"
34975,BOOK III.,Leaving thy wife to thee I sped;
34976,BOOK III.,"But by her keen reproaches sent,"
34977,BOOK III.,"O Ráma, to thine aid I went."
34978,BOOK III.,"She heard afar a mournful cry,"
34979,BOOK III.,"""O save me, Lakshman, or I die."""
34980,BOOK III.,The voice that spoke in moving tone
34981,BOOK III.,Smote on her ear and seemed thine own.
34982,BOOK III.,Soon as those accents reached her ear
34983,BOOK III.,"She yielded to her woe and fear,"
34984,BOOK III.,"She wept o'ercome by grief, and cried,"
34985,BOOK III.,"""Fly, Lakshman, fly to Ráma's side."""
34986,BOOK III.,"Though many a time she bade me speed,"
34987,BOOK III.,Her urgent prayer I would not heed.
34988,BOOK III.,"I bade her in thy strength confide,"
34989,BOOK III.,And thus with tender words replied:
34990,BOOK III.,"""No giant roams the forest shade"
34991,BOOK III.,From whom thy lord need shrink dismayed.
34992,BOOK III.,"No human voice, believe me, spoke"
34993,BOOK III.,Those words thy causeless fear that woke.
34994,BOOK III.,Can he whose might can save in woe
34995,BOOK III.,"The heavenly Gods e'er stoop so low,"
34996,BOOK III.,And with those piteous accents call
34997,BOOK III.,For succour like a caitiff thrall?
34998,BOOK III.,And why should wandering giants choose
34999,BOOK III.,"The accents of thy lord to use,"
35000,BOOK III.,"In alien tones my help to crave,"
35001,BOOK III.,"And cry aloud, O Lakshman, save?"
35002,BOOK III.,"Now let my words thy spirit cheer,"
35003,BOOK III.,Compose thy thoughts and banish fear.

35007,BOOK III.,Thy Ráma in the battle fray.
35008,BOOK III.,To heavenly hosts he ne'er would yield
35009,BOOK III.,"Though Indra led them to the field."""
35010,BOOK III.,To soothe her thus I vainly sought:
35011,BOOK III.,Her heart with woe was still distraught.
35012,BOOK III.,While from her eyes the waters ran
35013,BOOK III.,Her bitter speech she thus began:
35014,BOOK III.,"""Too well I see thy dark intent:"
35015,BOOK III.,Thy lawless thoughts on me are bent.
35016,BOOK III.,"Thou hopest, but thy hope is vain,"
35017,BOOK III.,"To win my love, thy brother slain."
35018,BOOK III.,"Not love, but Bharat's dark decree"
35019,BOOK III.,"To share his exile counselled thee,"

35023,BOOK III.,"Thou choosest by his side to go,"
35024,BOOK III.,And now thou longest that my lord
35025,BOOK III.,"Should die, and wilt no help afford."""
35026,BOOK III.,
35027,BOOK III.,Such were the words the lady said:
35028,BOOK III.,With angry fire my eyes were red.
35029,BOOK III.,With pale lips quivering in my rage
35030,BOOK III.,"I hastened from the hermitage."""
35031,BOOK III.,He ceased; and frenzied by his pain
35032,BOOK III.,The son of Raghu spoke again:
35033,BOOK III.,"""O brother, for thy fault I grieve,"
35034,BOOK III.,The Maithil dame alone to leave.
35035,BOOK III.,Thou knowest that my arm is strong
35036,BOOK III.,"To save me from the giant throng,"
35037,BOOK III.,"And yet couldst leave the cottage, spurred"
35038,BOOK III.,To folly by her angry word.
35039,BOOK III.,"For this thy deed I praise thee not,--"
35040,BOOK III.,"To leave her helpless in the cot,"
35041,BOOK III.,And thus thy sacred charge forsake
35042,BOOK III.,For the wild words a woman spake.
35043,BOOK III.,"Yea thou art all to blame herein,"
35044,BOOK III.,And very grievous is thy sin.
35045,BOOK III.,That anger swayed thy faithless breast
35046,BOOK III.,And made thee false to my behest.
35047,BOOK III.,An arrow speeding from my bow
35048,BOOK III.,"Has laid the treacherous giant low,"
35049,BOOK III.,Who lured me eager for the chase
35050,BOOK III.,Far from my hermit dwelling-place.
35051,BOOK III.,"The string with easy hand I drew,"
35052,BOOK III.,"The arrow as in pastime flew,"

35054,BOOK III.,"The borrowed form was cast away,"
35055,BOOK III.,Before mine eye a giant lay
35056,BOOK III.,With bright gold braceleted.
35057,BOOK III.,My arrow smote him in the chest:
35058,BOOK III.,The giant by the pain distressed
35059,BOOK III.,Raised his loud voice on high.
35060,BOOK III.,"Far rang the mournful sound: mine own,"
35061,BOOK III.,"It seemed, were accent, voice, and tone,"

35285,BOOK III.,"Then come, renew thy labour, trace"
35286,BOOK III.,"The lady to her lurking-place,"
35287,BOOK III.,And search the wood from side to side
35288,BOOK III.,To know where Sítá loves to bide.
35289,BOOK III.,"Collect thy thoughts, O royal chief,"
35290,BOOK III.,"Nor yield to unavailing grief."""
35291,BOOK III.,
35292,BOOK III.,"Thus Lakshman, by attention stirred,"
35293,BOOK III.,"To fresh attempts his brother spurred,"
35294,BOOK III.,"And Ráma, as he ceased, began"
35295,BOOK III.,With Lakshman's aid each spot to scan.
35296,BOOK III.,In eager search their way they took
35297,BOOK III.,"Through wood, o'er hill, by pool and brook,"
35298,BOOK III.,"They roamed each mount, nor spared to seek"
35299,BOOK III.,On ridge and crag and towering peak.
35300,BOOK III.,They sought the dame in every spot;
35301,BOOK III.,But all in vain; they found her not.
35302,BOOK III.,"Above, below, on every side"
35303,BOOK III.,"They ranged the hill, and Ráma cried,"
35304,BOOK III.,"""O Lakshman, O my brother still"
35305,BOOK III.,"No trace of Sítá on the hill!"""
35306,BOOK III.,Then Lakshman as he roamed the wood
35307,BOOK III.,"Beside his glorious brother stood,"
35308,BOOK III.,And while fierce grief his bosom burned
35309,BOOK III.,This answer to the chief returned:
35310,BOOK III.,"""Thou, Ráma, after toil and pain"
35311,BOOK III.,"Wilt meet the Maithil dame again,"
35312,BOOK III.,"As Vishnu, Bali's might subdued,"
35313,BOOK III.,"His empire of the earth renewed.""(508)"
35314,BOOK III.,
35315,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma cried in mournful tone,"
35316,BOOK III.,His spirit by his woe o'erthrown;
35317,BOOK III.,"""The wood is searched from side to side,"
35318,BOOK III.,"No distant spot remains untried,"
35319,BOOK III.,"No lilied pool, no streamlet where"
35320,BOOK III.,The lotus buds are fresh and fair.
35321,BOOK III.,Our eyes have searched the hill with all
35322,BOOK III.,"His caves and every waterfall,--"
35323,BOOK III.,"But ah, not yet I find my wife,"
35324,BOOK III.,"More precious than the breath of life."""
35325,BOOK III.,
35326,BOOK III.,As thus he mourned his vanished dame
35327,BOOK III.,"A mighty trembling seized his frame,"
35328,BOOK III.,"And by o'erpowering grief assailed,"
35329,BOOK III.,His troubled senses reeled and failed.
35330,BOOK III.,"Too great to bear his misery grew,"
35331,BOOK III.,"And many a long hot sigh he drew,"
35332,BOOK III.,"Then as he wept and sobbed and sighed,"
35333,BOOK III.,"""O Sítá, O my love!"" he cried."
35334,BOOK III.,"Then Lakshman, joining palm to palm,"
35335,BOOK III.,Tried every art his woe to calm.
35336,BOOK III.,But Ráma in his anguish heard
35337,BOOK III.,"Or heeded not one soothing word,"
35338,BOOK III.,"Still for his spouse he mourned, and shrill"
35339,BOOK III.,Rang out his lamentation still.

35348,BOOK III.,"Then, his sad soul with pain distraught,"
35349,BOOK III.,The hero of the lotus eyes
35350,BOOK III.,Filled all the air with frantic cries.
35351,BOOK III.,"O'erpowered by love's strong influence, he"
35352,BOOK III.,"His absent wife still seemed to see,"
35353,BOOK III.,And thus with accents weak and faint
35354,BOOK III.,Renewed with tears his wild complaint:
35355,BOOK III.,
35356,BOOK III.,"""Thou, fairer than their bloom, my spouse,"
35357,BOOK III.,Art hidden by Asoka boughs.
35358,BOOK III.,"Those blooms have power to banish care,"
35359,BOOK III.,But now they drive me to despair.
35360,BOOK III.,Thine arms are like the plantain's stem:
35361,BOOK III.,Why let the plantain cover them?
35362,BOOK III.,"Thou art not hidden, love; thy feet"
35363,BOOK III.,Betray thee in thy dark retreat.
35364,BOOK III.,Thou runnest in thy girlish sport
35365,BOOK III.,"To flowery trees, thy dear resort."
35366,BOOK III.,"But cease, O cease, my love, I pray,"
35367,BOOK III.,To vex me with thy cruel play.
35368,BOOK III.,Such mockery in a holy spot
35369,BOOK III.,Where hermits dwell beseems thee not.
35370,BOOK III.,"Ah, now I see thy fickle mind"
35371,BOOK III.,"To scornful mood too much inclined,"
35372,BOOK III.,"Come, large-eyed beauty, I implore;"
35373,BOOK III.,Lone is the cot so dear before.
35374,BOOK III.,
35375,BOOK III.,"No, she is slain by giants; they"
35376,BOOK III.,"Have stolen or devoured their prey,"
35377,BOOK III.,Or surely at my mournful cry
35378,BOOK III.,My darling to her lord would fly.
35379,BOOK III.,"O Lakshman, see those troops of deer:"
35380,BOOK III.,In each sad eye there gleams a tear.
35381,BOOK III.,Those looks of woe too clearly say
35382,BOOK III.,My consort is the giants' prey.
35383,BOOK III.,"O noblest, fairest of the fair,"
35384,BOOK III.,"Where art thou, best of women, where?"
35385,BOOK III.,This day will dark Kaikeyí find
35386,BOOK III.,"Fresh triumph for her evil mind,"
35387,BOOK III.,"When I, who with my Sítá came"
35388,BOOK III.,"Return alone, without my dame."
35389,BOOK III.,But ne'er can I return to see
35390,BOOK III.,Those chambers where my queen should be
35391,BOOK III.,And hear the scornful people speak
35392,BOOK III.,Of Ráma as a coward weak.
35393,BOOK III.,For mine will be the coward's shame
35394,BOOK III.,Who let the foeman steal his dame.
35395,BOOK III.,"How can I seek my home, or brook"

35398,BOOK III.,"My wanderings o'er, that all is well?"
35399,BOOK III.,"He, when I meet his eager view,"
35400,BOOK III.,"Will mark that Sítá comes not too,"
35401,BOOK III.,And when he hears the mournful tale
35402,BOOK III.,His wildered sense will reel and fail.
35403,BOOK III.,"""O Dasaratha"" will he cry,"
35404,BOOK III.,"""Blest in thy mansion in the sky!"""
35405,BOOK III.,"Ne'er to that town my steps shall bend,"
35406,BOOK III.,"That town which Bharat's arms defend,"
35407,BOOK III.,For e'en the blessed homes above
35408,BOOK III.,Would seem a waste without my love.
35409,BOOK III.,"Leave me, my brother, here, I pray;"

35423,BOOK III.,
35424,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma gave his sorrow vent,"
35425,BOOK III.,"And from a heart which anguish rent,"
35426,BOOK III.,"Mourned for his wife in loud lament,--"
35427,BOOK III.,"Her of the glorious hair,"

35453,BOOK III.,"So full of sin, whose hand has done"

35455,BOOK III.,"For my sad heart with misery bleeds,"
35456,BOOK III.,"As, guerdon of those evil deeds,"
35457,BOOK III.,Still greater woe to woe succeeds
35458,BOOK III.,In never-ending line.
35459,BOOK III.,"A life of sin I freely chose,"
35460,BOOK III.,And from my past transgression flows
35461,BOOK III.,A ceaseless flood of bitter woes
35462,BOOK III.,My folly to repay.
35463,BOOK III.,"The fruit of sin has ripened fast,"
35464,BOOK III.,"Through many a sorrow have I passed,"
35465,BOOK III.,And now the crowning grief at last
35466,BOOK III.,Falls on my head to-day.
35467,BOOK III.,"From all my faithful friends I fled,"
35468,BOOK III.,"My sire is numbered with the dead,"
35469,BOOK III.,"My royal rank is forfeited,"
35470,BOOK III.,My mother far away.
35471,BOOK III.,These woes on which I sadly think
35472,BOOK III.,"Fill, till it raves above the brink,"
35473,BOOK III.,"The stream of grief in which I sink,--"
35474,BOOK III.,The flood which naught can stay.
35475,BOOK III.,"Ne'er, brother, ne'er have I complained;"
35476,BOOK III.,"Though long by toil and trouble pained,"
35477,BOOK III.,Without a murmur I sustained
35478,BOOK III.,The woes of woodland life.
35479,BOOK III.,But fiercer than the flames that rise
35480,BOOK III.,"When crackling wood the food supplies,--"
35481,BOOK III.,"Flashing a glow through evening skies,--"
35482,BOOK III.,This sorrow for my wife.
35483,BOOK III.,Some cruel fiend has seized the prey
35484,BOOK III.,"And torn my trembling love away,"
35485,BOOK III.,"While, as he bore her through the skies,"
35486,BOOK III.,"She shrieked aloud with frantic cries,"
35487,BOOK III.,"In tones of fear which, wild and shrill,"
35488,BOOK III.,Retained their native sweetness still.
35489,BOOK III.,"Ah me, that breast so soft and sweet,"
35490,BOOK III.,"For sandal's precious perfume meet,"
35491,BOOK III.,"Now all detained with dust and gore,"
35492,BOOK III.,Shall meet my fond caress no more.
35493,BOOK III.,"That face, whose lips with tones so clear"
35494,BOOK III.,"Made pleasant music, sweet to hear,--"
35495,BOOK III.,"With soft locks plaited o'er the brow,--"
35496,BOOK III.,Some giant's hand is on it now.
35497,BOOK III.,"It smiles not, as the dear light fails"
35498,BOOK III.,When Ráhu's jaw the moon assails.
35499,BOOK III.,"Ah, my true love! that shapely neck"
35500,BOOK III.,"She loved with fairest chains to deck,"
35501,BOOK III.,"The cruel demons rend, and drain"
35502,BOOK III.,The lifeblood from each mangled vein.
35503,BOOK III.,"Ah, when the savage monsters came"
35504,BOOK III.,"And dragged away the helpless dame,"
35505,BOOK III.,The lady of the long soft eye

35507,BOOK III.,"Beneath this rock, O Lakshman, see,"

35509,BOOK III.,"And gently talked to thee the while,"
35510,BOOK III.,Her sweet lips opening with a smile.
35511,BOOK III.,Here is that fairest stream which she

35513,BOOK III.,Ne'er can the dame have passed this way:
35514,BOOK III.,"So far alone she would not stray,"
35515,BOOK III.,"Nor has my darling, lotus-eyed,"
35516,BOOK III.,"Sought lilies by the river's side,"
35517,BOOK III.,For without me she ne'er would go
35518,BOOK III.,"To streamlets where the wild flowers grow,"
35519,BOOK III.,"Tell me not, brother, she has strayed"
35520,BOOK III.,To the dark forest's distant shade
35521,BOOK III.,"Where blooming boughs are gay and sweet,"
35522,BOOK III.,And bright birds love the cool retreat.
35523,BOOK III.,"Alone my love would never dare,--"

35526,BOOK III.,O Lord of Day whose eye sees all

35562,BOOK III.,"""Thy steps, my brother, quickly turn"
35563,BOOK III.,To bright Godávarí and learn
35564,BOOK III.,If Sítá to the stream have hied

35566,BOOK III.,
35567,BOOK III.,"Obedient to the words he said,"
35568,BOOK III.,His brother to the river sped.

35571,BOOK III.,
35572,BOOK III.,"""I searched, but found her not,"" he cried;"
35573,BOOK III.,"""I called aloud, but none replied."

35575,BOOK III.,Whose sight would chase our cares away?
35576,BOOK III.,"I know not where, her steps untraced,"

35578,BOOK III.,
35579,BOOK III.,When Ráma heard the words he spoke
35580,BOOK III.,"Again he sank beneath the stroke,"
35581,BOOK III.,And with a bosom anguish-fraught
35582,BOOK III.,Himself the lovely river sought.
35583,BOOK III.,"There standing on the shelving side,"
35584,BOOK III.,"""O Sítá, where art thou?"" he cried."
35585,BOOK III.,"No spirit voice an answer gave,"
35586,BOOK III.,No murmur from the trembling wave
35587,BOOK III.,Of sweet Godávarí declared
35588,BOOK III.,The outrage which the fiend had dared.
35589,BOOK III.,"""O speak!"" the pitying spirits cried,"
35590,BOOK III.,"But yet the stream their prayer denied,"
35591,BOOK III.,"Nor dared she, coldly mute, relate"
35592,BOOK III.,To the sad chief his darling's fate
35593,BOOK III.,"Of Rávan's awful form she thought,"
35594,BOOK III.,"And the dire deed his arm had wrought,"
35595,BOOK III.,"And still withheld by fear dismayed,"
35596,BOOK III.,The tale for which the mourner prayed.
35597,BOOK III.,"When hope was none, his heart to cheer,"
35598,BOOK III.,That the bright stream his cry would hear
35599,BOOK III.,While sorrow for his darling tore
35600,BOOK III.,His longing soul he spake once more:
35601,BOOK III.,"""Though I have sought with tears and sighs"
35602,BOOK III.,"Godárvarí no word replies,"
35603,BOOK III.,"O say, what answer can I frame"
35604,BOOK III.,"To Janak, father of my dame?"
35605,BOOK III.,Or how before her mother stand
35606,BOOK III.,Leading no Sítá by the hand?
35607,BOOK III.,Where is my loyal love who went
35608,BOOK III.,Forth with her lord to banishment?
35609,BOOK III.,Her faith to me she nobly held
35610,BOOK III.,"Though from my realm and home expelled,--"
35611,BOOK III.,"A hermit, nursed on woodland fare,--"
35612,BOOK III.,She followed still and soothed my care.
35613,BOOK III.,"Of all my friends am I bereft,"
35614,BOOK III.,Nor is my faithful consort left.
35615,BOOK III.,How slowly will the long nights creep
35616,BOOK III.,While comfortless I wake and weep!
35617,BOOK III.,"O, if my wife may yet be found,"
35618,BOOK III.,With humble love I'll wander round
35619,BOOK III.,"This Janasthán, Prasravan's hill,"
35620,BOOK III.,Mandákiní's delightful rill.
35621,BOOK III.,See how the deer with gentle eyes
35622,BOOK III.,Look on my face and sympathize.
35623,BOOK III.,I mark their soft expression: each
35624,BOOK III.,"Would soothe me, if it could, with speech."""
35625,BOOK III.,
35626,BOOK III.,A while the anxious throng he eyed.
35627,BOOK III.,"And ""Where is Sítá, where?"" he cried."
35628,BOOK III.,Thus while hot tears his utterance broke
35629,BOOK III.,The mourning son of Raghu spoke.
35630,BOOK III.,The deer in pity for his woes
35631,BOOK III.,Obeyed the summons and arose.
35632,BOOK III.,"Upon his right thy stood, and raised"
35633,BOOK III.,Their sad eyes up to heaven and gazed
35634,BOOK III.,Each to that quarter bent her look
35635,BOOK III.,Which Rávan with his captive took.
35636,BOOK III.,"Then Raghu's son again they viewed,"
35637,BOOK III.,And toward that point their way pursued.
35638,BOOK III.,Then Lakshman watched their looks intent
35639,BOOK III.,"As moaning on their way they went,"
35640,BOOK III.,And marked each sign which struck his sense
35641,BOOK III.,"With mute expressive influence,"
35642,BOOK III.,Then as again his sorrow woke
35643,BOOK III.,Thus to his brother chief he spoke:
35644,BOOK III.,"""Those deer thy eager question heard"
35645,BOOK III.,And rose at once by pity stirred:
35646,BOOK III.,"See, in thy search their aid they lend,"
35647,BOOK III.,"See, to the south their looks they bend."
35648,BOOK III.,"Arise, dear brother, let us go"
35649,BOOK III.,"The way their eager glances show,"
35650,BOOK III.,If haply sign or trace descried
35651,BOOK III.,"Our footsteps in the search may guide."""
35652,BOOK III.,
35653,BOOK III.,"The son of Raghu gave assent,"
35654,BOOK III.,And quickly to the south they went;
35655,BOOK III.,"With eager eyes the earth he scanned,"
35656,BOOK III.,And Lakshman followed close at hand.
35657,BOOK III.,"As each to other spake his thought,"
35658,BOOK III.,"And round with anxious glances sought,"
35659,BOOK III.,"Scattered before them in the way,"
35660,BOOK III.,Blooms of a fallen garland lay.
35661,BOOK III.,When Ráma saw that flowery rain
35662,BOOK III.,He spoke once more with bitterest pain:
35663,BOOK III.,"""O Lakshman every flower that lies"
35664,BOOK III.,Here on the ground I recognize.
35665,BOOK III.,"I culled them in the grove, and there"
35666,BOOK III.,My darling twined them in her hair.
35667,BOOK III.,"The sun, the earth, the genial breeze"
35668,BOOK III.,"Have spared these flowers my soul to please."""
35669,BOOK III.,
35670,BOOK III.,"Then to that woody hill he prayed,"
35671,BOOK III.,Whence flashed afar each wild cascade:
35672,BOOK III.,"""O best of mountains, hast thou seen"
35673,BOOK III.,A dame of perfect form and mien
35674,BOOK III.,"In some sweet spot with trees o'ergrown,--"
35675,BOOK III.,"My darling whom I left alone?"""
35676,BOOK III.,Then as a lion threats a deer
35677,BOOK III.,He thundered with a voice of fear:
35678,BOOK III.,"""Reveal her, mountain, to my view"
35679,BOOK III.,With golden limbs and golden hue.
35680,BOOK III.,Where is my darling Sítá? speak
35681,BOOK III.,"Before I rend thee peak from peak."""
35682,BOOK III.,
35683,BOOK III.,"The mountain seemed her track to show,"
35684,BOOK III.,But told not all he sought to know.
35685,BOOK III.,Then Dasaratha's son renewed
35686,BOOK III.,His summons as the mount he viewed:
35687,BOOK III.,"""Soon as my flaming arrows fly,"
35688,BOOK III.,Consumed to ashes shall thou lie
35689,BOOK III.,"Without a herb or bud or tree,"
35690,BOOK III.,And birds no more shall dwell in thee.
35691,BOOK III.,"And if this stream my prayer deny,"
35692,BOOK III.,"My wrath this day her flood shall dry,"
35693,BOOK III.,Because she lends no aid to trace
35694,BOOK III.,"My darling of the lotus face."""
35695,BOOK III.,
35696,BOOK III.,Thus Ráma spake as though his ire
35697,BOOK III.,Would scorch them with his glance of fire;
35698,BOOK III.,Then searching farther on the ground
35699,BOOK III.,"The footprint of a fiend he found,"
35700,BOOK III.,"And small light traces here and there,"
35701,BOOK III.,"Where Sítá in her great despair,"
35702,BOOK III.,"Shrieking for Ráma's help, had fled"
35703,BOOK III.,Before the giant's mighty tread.
35704,BOOK III.,His careful eye each trace surveyed
35705,BOOK III.,"Which Sítá and the fiend had made,--"
35706,BOOK III.,The quivers and the broken bow
35707,BOOK III.,"And ruined chariot of the foe,--"
35708,BOOK III.,"And told, distraught by fear and grief,"
35709,BOOK III.,His tidings to his brother chief:
35710,BOOK III.,"""O Lakshman, here,"" he cried ""behold"
35711,BOOK III.,My Sítá's earrings dropped with gold.
35712,BOOK III.,"Here lie her garlands torn and rent,"
35713,BOOK III.,Here lies each glittering ornament.
35714,BOOK III.,"O look, the ground on every side"
35715,BOOK III.,With blood-like drops of gold is dyed.
35716,BOOK III.,The fiends who wear each strange disguise
35717,BOOK III.,"Have seized, I ween, the helpless prize."
35718,BOOK III.,"My lady, by their hands o'erpowered,"
35719,BOOK III.,"Is slaughtered, mangled, and devoured."
35720,BOOK III.,Methinks two fearful giants came
35721,BOOK III.,And waged fierce battle for the dame.
35722,BOOK III.,"Whose, Lakshman, was this mighty bow"
35723,BOOK III.,With pearls and gems in glittering row?
35724,BOOK III.,"Cast to the ground the fragments lie,"
35725,BOOK III.,And still their glory charms the eye.
35726,BOOK III.,A bow so mighty sure was planned
35727,BOOK III.,For heavenly God or giant's hand.
35728,BOOK III.,Whose was this coat of golden mail
35729,BOOK III.,"Which, though its lustre now is pale,"
35730,BOOK III.,"Shone like the sun of morning, bright"
35731,BOOK III.,With studs of glittering lazulite?
35732,BOOK III.,"Whose, Lakshman, was this bloom-wreathed shade"
35733,BOOK III.,With all its hundred ribs displayed?
35734,BOOK III.,"This screen, most meet for royal brow,"
35735,BOOK III.,With broken staff lies useless now.
35736,BOOK III.,"And these tall asses, goblin-faced,"
35737,BOOK III.,"With plates of golden harness graced,"
35738,BOOK III.,Whose hideous forms are stained with gore
35739,BOOK III.,Who is the lord whose yoke they bore?
35740,BOOK III.,Whose was this pierced and broken car
35741,BOOK III.,That shoots a flame-like blaze afar?
35742,BOOK III.,"Whose these spent shafts at random spread,"
35743,BOOK III.,"Each fearful with its iron head,--"
35744,BOOK III.,"With golden mountings fair to see,"
35745,BOOK III.,Long as a chariot's axle-tree?
35746,BOOK III.,"These quivers see, which, rent in twain,"
35747,BOOK III.,Their sheaves of arrows still contain.
35748,BOOK III.,"Whose was this driver? Dead and cold,"
35749,BOOK III.,His hands the whip and reins still hold.
35750,BOOK III.,"See, Lakshman, here the foot I trace"
35751,BOOK III.,"Of man, nay, one of giant race."
35752,BOOK III.,The hatred that I nursed of old
35753,BOOK III.,Grows mightier now a hundred fold
35754,BOOK III.,"Against these giants, fierce of heart,"
35755,BOOK III.,Who change their forms by magic art.
35756,BOOK III.,"Slain, eaten by the giant press,"
35757,BOOK III.,"Or stolen is the votaress,"
35758,BOOK III.,Nor could her virtue bring defence
35759,BOOK III.,To Sítá seized and hurried hence.
35760,BOOK III.,"O, if my love be slain or lost"
35761,BOOK III.,All hope of bliss for me is crossed.
35762,BOOK III.,The power of all the worlds were vain
35763,BOOK III.,To bring one joy to soothe my pain.
35764,BOOK III.,The spirits with their blinded eyes
35765,BOOK III.,"Would look in wonder, and despise"
35766,BOOK III.,"The Lord who made the worlds, the great"
35767,BOOK III.,Creator when compassionate.
35768,BOOK III.,"And so, I ween, the Immortals turn"
35769,BOOK III.,"Cold eyes upon me now, and spurn"
35770,BOOK III.,"The weakling prompt at pity's call,"
35771,BOOK III.,Devoted to the good of all.
35772,BOOK III.,"But from this day behold me changed,"
35773,BOOK III.,From every gentle grace estranged.
35774,BOOK III.,"Now be it mine all life to slay,"
35775,BOOK III.,And sweep these cursed fiends away.
35776,BOOK III.,"As the great sun leaps up the sky,"
35777,BOOK III.,"And the cold moonbeams fade and die,"
35778,BOOK III.,"So vengeance rises in my breast,"
35779,BOOK III.,One passion conquering all the rest.
35780,BOOK III.,"Gandharvas in their radiant place,"
35781,BOOK III.,"The Yakshas, and the giant race,"
35782,BOOK III.,Kinnars and men shall look in vain
35783,BOOK III.,For joy they ne'er shall see again.
35784,BOOK III.,"The anguish of my great despair,"
35785,BOOK III.,"O Lakshman, fills the heaven and air;"
35786,BOOK III.,And I in wrath all life will slay
35787,BOOK III.,Within the triple world to-day.
35788,BOOK III.,Unless the Gods in heaven who dwell
35789,BOOK III.,"Restore my Sítá safe and well,"
35790,BOOK III.,"I armed with all the fires of Fate,"
35791,BOOK III.,The triple world will devastate.
35792,BOOK III.,"The troubled stars from heaven shall fall,"
35793,BOOK III.,"The moon be wrapped in gloomy pall,"
35794,BOOK III.,"The fire be quenched, the wind be stilled,"
35795,BOOK III.,The radiant sun grow dark and chilled;
35796,BOOK III.,"Crushed every mountain's towering pride,"
35797,BOOK III.,"And every lake and river dried,"
35798,BOOK III.,"Dead every creeper, plant, and tree,"
35799,BOOK III.,And lost for aye the mighty sea.
35800,BOOK III.,Thou shalt the world this day behold
35801,BOOK III.,"In wild disorder uncontrolled,"
35802,BOOK III.,With dying life which naught defends
35803,BOOK III.,From the fierce storm my bowstring sends.
35804,BOOK III.,"My shafts this day, for Sítá's sake,"
35805,BOOK III.,The life of every fiend shall take.
35806,BOOK III.,The Gods this day shall see the force
35807,BOOK III.,"That wings my arrows on their course,"
35808,BOOK III.,"And mark how far that course is held,"
35809,BOOK III.,By my unsparing wrath impelled.
35810,BOOK III.,"No God, not one of Daitya strain,"
35811,BOOK III.,Goblin or Rákshas shall remain.
35812,BOOK III.,"My wrath shall end the worlds, and all"
35813,BOOK III.,Demons and Gods therewith shall fall.
35814,BOOK III.,"Each world which Gods, the Dánav race,"
35815,BOOK III.,"And giants make their dwelling place,"
35816,BOOK III.,Shall fall beneath my arrows sent
35817,BOOK III.,In fury when my bow is bent.
35818,BOOK III.,The arrows loosened from my string
35819,BOOK III.,Confusion on the worlds shall bring.
35820,BOOK III.,"For she is lost or breathes no more,"
35821,BOOK III.,Nor will the Gods my love restore.
35822,BOOK III.,Hence all on earth with life and breath
35823,BOOK III.,This day I dedicate to death.
35824,BOOK III.,"All, till my darling they reveal,"
35825,BOOK III.,"The fury of my shafts shall feel."""
35826,BOOK III.,
35827,BOOK III.,"Thus as he spake by rage impelled,"
35828,BOOK III.,"Red grew his eyes, his fierce lips swelled."
35829,BOOK III.,His bark coat round his form he drew
35830,BOOK III.,"And coiled his hermit braids anew,"
35831,BOOK III.,Like Rudra when he yearned to slay
35832,BOOK III.,The demon Tripur(509) in the fray.
35833,BOOK III.,"So looked the hero brave and wise,"
35834,BOOK III.,The fury flashing from his eyes.
35835,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma, conqueror of the foe,"
35836,BOOK III.,"From Lakshman's hand received his bow,"
35837,BOOK III.,"Strained the great string, and laid thereon"
35838,BOOK III.,"A deadly dart that flashed and shone,"
35839,BOOK III.,And spake these words as fierce in ire
35840,BOOK III.,As He who ends the worlds with fire:
35841,BOOK III.,
35842,BOOK III.,"""As age and time and death and fate"
35843,BOOK III.,"All life with checkless power await,"
35844,BOOK III.,So Lakshman in my wrath to-day
35845,BOOK III.,"My vengeful might shall brook no stay,"
35846,BOOK III.,Unless this day I see my dame
35847,BOOK III.,"In whose sweet form is naught to blame,--"
35848,BOOK III.,"Yea, as before, my love behold"
35849,BOOK III.,"Fair with bright teeth and perfect mould,"
35850,BOOK III.,This world shall feel a deadly blow
35851,BOOK III.,"Destroyed with ruthless overthrow,"
35852,BOOK III.,"And serpent lords and Gods of air,"
35853,BOOK III.,"Gandharvas, men, the doom shall share."""

35861,BOOK III.,"He stood incensed with eyes of flame,"
35862,BOOK III.,"Still mourning for his ravished dame,"
35863,BOOK III.,"Determined, like the fire of Fate,"
35864,BOOK III.,To leave the wide world desolate.
35865,BOOK III.,"His ready bow the hero eyed,"
35866,BOOK III.,"And as again, again he sighed,"
35867,BOOK III.,The triple world would fain consume
35868,BOOK III.,Like Hara(510) in the day of doom.
35869,BOOK III.,Then Lakshman moved with sorrow viewed
35870,BOOK III.,"His brother in unwonted mood,"
35871,BOOK III.,"And reverent palm to palm applied,"
35872,BOOK III.,Thus spoke with lips which terror dried
35873,BOOK III.,"""Thy heart was ever soft and kind,"
35874,BOOK III.,To every creature's good inclined.

35881,BOOK III.,So glory with her noble fruit
35882,BOOK III.,Is thine eternal attribute.
35883,BOOK III.,"O, let not, for the sin of one,"
35884,BOOK III.,The triple world be all undone.
35885,BOOK III.,I know not whose this car that lies
35886,BOOK III.,"In fragments here before our eyes,"

35890,BOOK III.,Or whose the hand that plied the steel
35891,BOOK III.,"Which left this spot, the battle o'er,"
35892,BOOK III.,Thus sadly dyed with drops of gore.
35893,BOOK III.,Searching with utmost care I view
35894,BOOK III.,The signs of one and not of two.
35895,BOOK III.,Where'er I turn mine eyes I trace
35896,BOOK III.,No mighty host about the place.
35897,BOOK III.,Then mete not out for one offence
35898,BOOK III.,This all-involving recompense.
35899,BOOK III.,"For kings should use the sword they bear,"
35900,BOOK III.,"But mild in time should learn to spare,"
35901,BOOK III.,"Thou, ever moved by misery's call,"
35902,BOOK III.,Wast the great hope and stay of all.
35903,BOOK III.,Throughout this world who would not blame
35904,BOOK III.,This outrage on thy ravished dame?
35905,BOOK III.,"Gandharvas, Dánavs, Gods, the trees,"
35906,BOOK III.,"The rocks, the rivers, and the seas,"
35907,BOOK III.,"Can ne'er in aught thy soul offend,"
35908,BOOK III.,As one whom holiest rites befriend.
35909,BOOK III.,But him who dared to steal the dame
35910,BOOK III.,"Pursue, O King, with ceaseless aim,"
35911,BOOK III.,"With me, the hermits' holy band,"
35912,BOOK III.,And thy great bow to arm thy hand
35913,BOOK III.,"By every mighty flood we'll seek,"
35914,BOOK III.,"Each wood, each hill from base to peak."
35915,BOOK III.,"To the fair homes of Gods we'll fly,"
35916,BOOK III.,"And bright Gandharvas in the sky,"
35917,BOOK III.,"Until we reach, where'er he be,"
35918,BOOK III.,The wretch who stole thy spouse from thee.
35919,BOOK III.,Then if the Gods will not restore

36102,BOOK III.,"When toil my aged strength subdued,"

36104,BOOK III.,Then lifting up the dame he bare
36105,BOOK III.,His captive through the fields of air.
36106,BOOK III.,"Thy vengeful blows from me restrain,"
36107,BOOK III.,"Already by the giant slain."""
36108,BOOK III.,
36109,BOOK III.,When Ráma heard the vulture tell
36110,BOOK III.,"The tale that proved his love so well,"
36111,BOOK III.,"His bow upon the ground he placed,"
36112,BOOK III.,And tenderly the bird embraced:
36113,BOOK III.,"Then to the earth he fell o'erpowered,"
36114,BOOK III.,"And burning tears both brothers showered,"
36115,BOOK III.,For double pain and anguish pressed
36116,BOOK III.,Upon the patient hero's breast.
36117,BOOK III.,The solitary bird he eyed
36118,BOOK III.,"Who in the lone wood gasped and sighed,"
36119,BOOK III.,And as again his anguish woke
36120,BOOK III.,Thus Ráma to his brother spoke:
36121,BOOK III.,
36122,BOOK III.,"""Expelled from power the woods I tread,"
36123,BOOK III.,"My spouse is lost, the bird is dead."
36124,BOOK III.,"A fate so sad, I ween, would tame"
36125,BOOK III.,The vigour of the glorious flame.
36126,BOOK III.,If I to cool my fever tried
36127,BOOK III.,"To cross the deep from side to side,"
36128,BOOK III.,"The sea,--so hard my fate,--would dry"
36129,BOOK III.,His waters as my feet came nigh.
36130,BOOK III.,In all this world there lives not one
36131,BOOK III.,So cursed as I beneath the sun;
36132,BOOK III.,So strong a net of misery cast
36133,BOOK III.,"Around me holds the captive fast,"
36134,BOOK III.,"Best of all birds that play the wing,"
36135,BOOK III.,"Loved, honoured by our sire the king,"
36136,BOOK III.,"The vulture, in my fate enwound,"
36137,BOOK III.,"Lies bleeding, dying on the ground."""
36138,BOOK III.,
36139,BOOK III.,Then Ráma and his brother stirred
36140,BOOK III.,"By pity mourned the royal bird,"
36141,BOOK III.,"And, as their hands his limbs caressed,"
36142,BOOK III.,Affection for a sire expressed.
36143,BOOK III.,And Ráma to his bosom strained
36144,BOOK III.,"The bird with mangled wings distained,"
36145,BOOK III.,With crimson blood-drops dyed.
36146,BOOK III.,"He fell, and shedding many a tear,"
36147,BOOK III.,"""Where is my spouse than life more dear?"
36148,BOOK III.,"Where is my love?"" he cried."
36149,BOOK III.,
36150,BOOK III.,
36151,BOOK III.,
36152,BOOK III.,
36153,BOOK III.,Canto LXIX. The Death Of Jatáyus.
36154,BOOK III.,
36155,BOOK III.,
36156,BOOK III.,As Ráma viewed with heart-felt pain
36157,BOOK III.,"The vulture whom the fiend had slain,"
36158,BOOK III.,In words with tender love impressed
36159,BOOK III.,His brother chief he thus addressed:
36160,BOOK III.,
36161,BOOK III.,"""This royal bird with faithful thought"
36162,BOOK III.,For my advantage strove and fought.
36163,BOOK III.,Slain by the fiend in mortal strife
36164,BOOK III.,For me he yields his noble life.
36165,BOOK III.,"See, Lakshman, how his wounds have bled;"
36166,BOOK III.,His struggling breath will soon have fled.
36167,BOOK III.,"Faint is his voice, and near to die,"
36168,BOOK III.,He scarce can lift his trembling eye.
36169,BOOK III.,"Jatáyus, if thou still can speak,"
36170,BOOK III.,"Give, give the answer that I seek."
36171,BOOK III.,"The fate of ravished Sítá tell,"
36172,BOOK III.,And how thy mournful chance befell.
36173,BOOK III.,Say why the giant stole my dame:
36174,BOOK III.,What have I done that he could blame?
36175,BOOK III.,What fault in me has Rávan seen
36176,BOOK III.,That he should rob me of my queen?
36177,BOOK III.,How looked the lady's moon-bright cheek?
36178,BOOK III.,What were the words she found to speak?
36179,BOOK III.,"His strength, his might, his deeds declare:"
36180,BOOK III.,And tell the form he loves to wear.
36181,BOOK III.,To all my questions make reply:
36182,BOOK III.,"Where does the giant's dwelling lie?"""
36183,BOOK III.,
36184,BOOK III.,The noble bird his glances bent
36185,BOOK III.,"On Ráma as he made lament,"
36186,BOOK III.,And in low accents faint and weak
36187,BOOK III.,With anguish thus began to speak:
36188,BOOK III.,"""Fierce Rávan, king of giant race,"
36189,BOOK III.,Stole Sítá from thy dwelling-place.
36190,BOOK III.,He calls his magic art to aid
36191,BOOK III.,With wind and cloud and gloomy shade.
36192,BOOK III.,When in the fight my power was spent
36193,BOOK III.,My wearied wings he cleft and rent.
36194,BOOK III.,"Then round the dame his arms he threw,"
36195,BOOK III.,And to the southern region flew.
36196,BOOK III.,"O Raghu's son, I gasp for breath,"
36197,BOOK III.,My swimming sight is dim in death.
36198,BOOK III.,E'en now before my vision pass
36199,BOOK III.,"Bright trees of gold with hair of grass,"
36200,BOOK III.,The hour the impious robber chose
36201,BOOK III.,Brings on the thief a flood of woes.
36202,BOOK III.,The giant in his haste forgot
36203,BOOK III.,"'Twas Vinda's hour,(513) or heeded not."
36204,BOOK III.,Those robbed at such a time obtain
36205,BOOK III.,Their plundered store and wealth again.
36206,BOOK III.,"He, like a fish that takes the bait,"
36207,BOOK III.,In briefest time shall meet his fate.
36208,BOOK III.,Now be thy troubled heart controlled
36209,BOOK III.,"And for thy lady's loss consoled,"
36210,BOOK III.,For thou wilt slay the fiend in fight
36211,BOOK III.,"And with thy dame have new delight."""
36212,BOOK III.,
36213,BOOK III.,"With senses clear, though sorely tried,"
36214,BOOK III.,"The royal vulture thus replied,"
36215,BOOK III.,While as he sank beneath his pain
36216,BOOK III.,Forth rushed the tide of blood again.
36217,BOOK III.,"""Him,(514) brother of the Lord of Gold,"
36218,BOOK III.,"Visravas' self begot of old."""
36219,BOOK III.,"Thus spoke the bird, and stained with gore"
36220,BOOK III.,Resigned the breath that came no more.
36221,BOOK III.,
36222,BOOK III.,"""Speak, speak again!"" thus Ráma cried,"
36223,BOOK III.,"With reverent palm to palm applied,"
36224,BOOK III.,But from the frame the spirit fled
36225,BOOK III.,And to the skiey regions sped.
36226,BOOK III.,The breath of life had passed away.
36227,BOOK III.,Stretched on the ground the body lay.
36228,BOOK III.,
36229,BOOK III.,"When Ráma saw the vulture lie,"
36230,BOOK III.,"Huge as a hill, with darksome eye,"
36231,BOOK III.,With many a poignant woe distressed
36232,BOOK III.,His brother chief he thus addressed:
36233,BOOK III.,"""Amid these haunted shades content"
36234,BOOK III.,Full many a year this bird has spent.
36235,BOOK III.,"His life in home of giants passed,"
36236,BOOK III.,In Dandak wood he dies at last.
36237,BOOK III.,The years in lengthened course have fled
36238,BOOK III.,"Untroubled o'er the vulture's head,"
36239,BOOK III.,"And now he lies in death, for none"
36240,BOOK III.,The stern decrees of Fate may shun.
36241,BOOK III.,"See, Lakshman, how the vulture fell"
36242,BOOK III.,While for my sake he battled well.
36243,BOOK III.,And strove to free with onset bold
36244,BOOK III.,My Sítá from the giant's hold.
36245,BOOK III.,Supreme amid the vulture kind
36246,BOOK III.,"His ancient rule the bird resigned,"
36247,BOOK III.,And conquered in the fruitless strife
36248,BOOK III.,Gave for my sake his noble life.
36249,BOOK III.,"O Lakshman, many a time we see"
36250,BOOK III.,"Great souls who keep the law's decree,"
36251,BOOK III.,"With whom the weak sure refuge find,"
36252,BOOK III.,In creatures of inferior kind.
36253,BOOK III.,"The loss of her, my darling queen,"
36254,BOOK III.,Strikes with a pang less fiercely keen
36255,BOOK III.,Than now this slaughtered bird to see
36256,BOOK III.,Who nobly fought and died for me.
36257,BOOK III.,"As Dasaratha, good and great,"
36258,BOOK III.,"Was glorious in his high estate,"
36259,BOOK III.,"Honoured by all, to all endeared,"
36260,BOOK III.,So was this royal bird revered.
36261,BOOK III.,Bring fuel for the funeral rite:
36262,BOOK III.,These hands the solemn fire shall light
36263,BOOK III.,And on the burning pyre shall lay
36264,BOOK III.,The bird who died for me to-day.
36265,BOOK III.,Now on the gathered wood shall lie
36266,BOOK III.,"The lord of all the birds that fly,"
36267,BOOK III.,And I will burn with honours due
36268,BOOK III.,My champion whom the giant slew.
36269,BOOK III.,"O royal bird of noblest heart,"
36270,BOOK III.,Graced with all funeral rites depart
36271,BOOK III.,"To bright celestial seats above,"
36272,BOOK III.,Rewarded for thy faithful love.
36273,BOOK III.,Dwell in thy happy home with those
36274,BOOK III.,Whose constant fires of worship rose.
36275,BOOK III.,"Live blest amid the unyielding brave,"
36276,BOOK III.,"And those who land in largess gave."""
36277,BOOK III.,
36278,BOOK III.,Sore grief upon his bosom weighed
36279,BOOK III.,"As on the pyre the bird he laid,"
36280,BOOK III.,And bade the kindled flame ascend
36281,BOOK III.,To burn the body of his friend.
36282,BOOK III.,Then with his brother by his side
36283,BOOK III.,The hero to the forest hied.
36284,BOOK III.,"There many a stately deer he slew,"
36285,BOOK III.,The flesh around the bird to strew.
36286,BOOK III.,"The venison into balls he made,"
36287,BOOK III.,And on fair grass before him laid.
36288,BOOK III.,Then that the parted soul might rise
36289,BOOK III.,"And find free passage to the skies,"
36290,BOOK III.,Each solemn word and text he said
36291,BOOK III.,Which Bráhmans utter o'er the dead.
36292,BOOK III.,Then hastening went the princely pair
36293,BOOK III.,"To bright Godávarí, and there"
36294,BOOK III.,Libations of the stream they poured
36295,BOOK III.,"In honour of the vulture lord,"
36296,BOOK III.,"With solemn ritual to the slain,"
36297,BOOK III.,As scripture's holy texts ordain.
36298,BOOK III.,Thus offerings to the bird they gave
36299,BOOK III.,And bathed their bodies in the wave.
36300,BOOK III.,
36301,BOOK III.,The vulture monarch having wrought
36302,BOOK III.,"A hard and glorious feat,"
36303,BOOK III.,"Honoured by Ráma sage in thought,"
36304,BOOK III.,Soared to his blissful seat.
36305,BOOK III.,"The brothers, when each rite was paid"
36306,BOOK III.,"To him of birds supreme,"
36307,BOOK III.,"Their hearts with new-found comfort stayed,"
36308,BOOK III.,And turned them from the stream.
36309,BOOK III.,Like sovereigns of celestial race
36310,BOOK III.,"Within the wood they came,"
36311,BOOK III.,"Each pondering the means to trace,"
36312,BOOK III.,The captor of the dame.
36313,BOOK III.,
36314,BOOK III.,
36315,BOOK III.,
36316,BOOK III.,
36317,BOOK III.,Canto LXX. Kabandha.
36318,BOOK III.,
36319,BOOK III.,
36320,BOOK III.,When every rite was duly paid
36321,BOOK III.,"The princely brothers onward strayed,"
36322,BOOK III.,And eager in the lady's quest
36323,BOOK III.,They turned their footsteps to the west.
36324,BOOK III.,Through lonely woods that round them lay
36325,BOOK III.,"Ikshváku's children made their way,"
36326,BOOK III.,And armed with bow and shaft and brand
36327,BOOK III.,Pressed onward to the southern land.
36328,BOOK III.,Thick trees and shrubs and creepers grew
36329,BOOK III.,In the wild grove they hurried through.
36330,BOOK III.,'Twas dark and drear and hard to pass
36331,BOOK III.,For tangled thorns and matted grass.
36332,BOOK III.,Still onward with a southern course
36333,BOOK III.,"They made their way with vigorous force,"
36334,BOOK III.,And passing through the mazes stood
36335,BOOK III.,Beyond that vast and fearful wood.
36336,BOOK III.,With toil and hardship yet unspent
36337,BOOK III.,"Three leagues from Janasthán they went,"
36338,BOOK III.,And speeding on their way at last
36339,BOOK III.,Within the wood of Krauncha(515) passed:
36340,BOOK III.,A fearful forest wild and black
36341,BOOK III.,"As some huge pile of cloudy rack,"
36342,BOOK III.,"Filled with all birds and beasts, where grew"
36343,BOOK III.,Bright blooms of every varied hue.
36344,BOOK III.,On Sítá bending every thought
36345,BOOK III.,"Through all the mighty wood they sought,"
36346,BOOK III.,And at the lady's loss dismayed
36347,BOOK III.,Here for a while and there they stayed.
36348,BOOK III.,Then turning farther eastward they
36349,BOOK III.,"Pursued three leagues their weary way,"
36350,BOOK III.,Passed Krauncha's wood and reached the grove
36351,BOOK III.,Where elephants rejoiced to rove.
36352,BOOK III.,The chiefs that awful wood surveyed
36353,BOOK III.,"Where deer and wild birds filled each glade,"
36354,BOOK III.,Where scarce a step the foot could take
36355,BOOK III.,For tangled shrub and tree and brake.
36356,BOOK III.,There in a mountain's woody side
36357,BOOK III.,"A cave the royal brothers spied,"
36358,BOOK III.,"With dread abysses deep as hell,"
36359,BOOK III.,Where darkness never ceased to dwell.
36360,BOOK III.,"When, pressing on, the lords of men"
36361,BOOK III.,"Stood near the entrance of the den,"
36362,BOOK III.,They saw within the dark recess
36363,BOOK III.,A huge misshapen giantess;
36364,BOOK III.,A thing the timid heart that shook
36365,BOOK III.,With fearful shape and savage look.
36366,BOOK III.,"Terrific fiend, her voice was fierce,"
36367,BOOK III.,Long were her teeth to rend and pierce.
36368,BOOK III.,The monster gorged her horrid feast
36369,BOOK III.,"Of flesh of many a savage beast,"
36370,BOOK III.,"While her long locks, at random flung,"
36371,BOOK III.,Dishevelled o'er her shoulders hung.
36372,BOOK III.,"Their eyes the royal brothers raised,"
36373,BOOK III.,And on the fearful monster gazed.
36374,BOOK III.,Forth from her den she came and glanced
36375,BOOK III.,"At Lakshman as he first advanced,"
36376,BOOK III.,"Her eager arms to hold him spread,"
36377,BOOK III.,"And ""Come and be my love"" she said,"
36378,BOOK III.,"Then as she held him to her breast,"
36379,BOOK III.,The prince in words like these addressed:
36380,BOOK III.,"""Behold thy treasure fond and fair:"
36381,BOOK III.,Ayomukhi(516) the name I bear.
36382,BOOK III.,"In thickets of each lofty hill,"
36383,BOOK III.,"On islets of each brook and rill,"
36384,BOOK III.,"With me delighted shalt thou play,"
36385,BOOK III.,"And live for many a lengthened day."""
36386,BOOK III.,
36387,BOOK III.,Enraged he heard the monster woo;
36388,BOOK III.,"His ready sword he swiftly drew,"
36389,BOOK III.,And the sharp steel that quelled his foes
36390,BOOK III.,Cut through her breast and ear and nose.
36391,BOOK III.,Thus mangled by his vengeful sword
36392,BOOK III.,"In rage and pain the demon roared,"
36393,BOOK III.,And hideous with her awful face
36394,BOOK III.,Sped to her secret dwelling place.
36395,BOOK III.,"Soon as the fiend had fled from sight,"
36396,BOOK III.,"The brothers, dauntless in their might,"
36397,BOOK III.,Reached a wild forest dark and dread
36398,BOOK III.,Whose tangled ways were hard to tread.
36399,BOOK III.,"Then bravest Lakshman, virtuous youth,"
36400,BOOK III.,"The friend of purity and truth,"
36401,BOOK III.,With reverent palm to palm applied
36402,BOOK III.,Thus to his glorious brother cried:
36403,BOOK III.,
36404,BOOK III.,"""My arm presaging throbs amain,"
36405,BOOK III.,"My troubled heart is sick with pain,"
36406,BOOK III.,And cheerless omens ill portend
36407,BOOK III.,Where'er my anxious eyes I bend.
36408,BOOK III.,"Dear brother, hear my words: advance"
36409,BOOK III.,"Resolved and armed for every chance,"
36410,BOOK III.,For every sign I mark to-day
36411,BOOK III.,Foretells a peril in the way.
36412,BOOK III.,"This bird of most ill-omened note,"
36413,BOOK III.,"Loud screaming with discordant throat,"
36414,BOOK III.,Announces with a warning cry
36415,BOOK III.,"That strife and victory are nigh."""
36416,BOOK III.,
36417,BOOK III.,Then as the chiefs their search pursued
36418,BOOK III.,"Throughout the dreary solitude,"
36419,BOOK III.,They heard amazed a mighty sound
36420,BOOK III.,"That broke the very trees around,"
36421,BOOK III.,As though a furious tempest passed
36422,BOOK III.,Crushing the wood beneath its blast.
36423,BOOK III.,"Then Ráma raised his trusty sword,"
36424,BOOK III.,And both the hidden cause explored.
36425,BOOK III.,There stood before their wondering eyes
36426,BOOK III.,"A fiend broad-chested, huge of size."
36427,BOOK III.,A vast misshapen trunk they saw
36428,BOOK III.,In height surpassing nature's law.
36429,BOOK III.,It stood before them dire and dread
36430,BOOK III.,"Without a neck, without a head."
36431,BOOK III.,"Tall as some hill aloft in air,"
36432,BOOK III.,"Its limbs were clothed with bristling hair,"
36433,BOOK III.,And deep below the monster's waist
36434,BOOK III.,His vast misshapen mouth was placed.
36435,BOOK III.,"His form was huge, his voice was loud"
36436,BOOK III.,As some dark-tinted thunder cloud.
36437,BOOK III.,Forth from his ample chest there came
36438,BOOK III.,A brilliance as of gushing flame.
36439,BOOK III.,"Beneath long lashes, dark and keen"
36440,BOOK III.,The monster's single eye was seen.
36441,BOOK III.,"Deep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,"
36442,BOOK III.,It glittered with terrific light.
36443,BOOK III.,He swallowed down his savage fare
36444,BOOK III.,"Of lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,"
36445,BOOK III.,And with huge teeth exposed to view
36446,BOOK III.,O'er his great lips his tongue he drew.
36447,BOOK III.,"His arms unshapely, vast and dread,"
36448,BOOK III.,"A league in length, he raised and spread."
36449,BOOK III.,He seized with monstrous hands a herd
36450,BOOK III.,Of deer and many a bear and bird.
36451,BOOK III.,"Among them all he picked and chose,"
36452,BOOK III.,"Drew forward these, rejected those."
36453,BOOK III.,Before the princely pair he stood
36454,BOOK III.,Barring their passage through the wood.
36455,BOOK III.,A league of shade the chiefs had passed
36456,BOOK III.,When on the fiend their eyes they cast.
36457,BOOK III.,A monstrous shape without a head
36458,BOOK III.,"With mighty arms before him spread,"
36459,BOOK III.,They saw that hideous trunk appear
36460,BOOK III.,That struck the trembling eye with fear.
36461,BOOK III.,"Then, stretching to their full extent"
36462,BOOK III.,"His awful arms with fingers bent,"
36463,BOOK III.,Round Raghu's princely sons he cast
36464,BOOK III.,Each grasping limb and held them fast.
36465,BOOK III.,"Though strong of arm and fierce in fight,"
36466,BOOK III.,"Each armed with bow and sword to smite,"
36467,BOOK III.,"The royal brothers, brave and bold,"
36468,BOOK III.,Were helpless in the giant's hold.
36469,BOOK III.,"Then Raghu's son, heroic still,"
36470,BOOK III.,Felt not a pang his bosom thrill;
36471,BOOK III.,"But young, with no protection near,"
36472,BOOK III.,"His brother's heart was sad with fear,"
36473,BOOK III.,And thus with trembling tongue he said
36474,BOOK III.,"To Ráma, sore disquieted:"
36475,BOOK III.,
36476,BOOK III.,"""Ah me, ah me, my days are told:"
36477,BOOK III.,O see me in the giant's hold.
36478,BOOK III.,"Fly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,"
36479,BOOK III.,And thy dear self from danger free.
36480,BOOK III.,Me to the fiend an offering give;
36481,BOOK III.,Fly at thine ease thyself and live.
36482,BOOK III.,"Thou, great Kakutstha's son, I ween,"
36483,BOOK III.,"Wilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,"
36484,BOOK III.,"And when thou holdest, throned again,"
36485,BOOK III.,"Thine old hereditary reign,"
36486,BOOK III.,"With servants prompt to do thy will,"
36487,BOOK III.,"O think upon thy brother still."""
36488,BOOK III.,"As thus the trembling Lakshman cried,"
36489,BOOK III.,The dauntless Ráma thus replied:
36490,BOOK III.,"""Brother, from causeless dread forbear."
36491,BOOK III.,"A chief like thee should scorn despair."""
36492,BOOK III.,He spoke to soothe his wild alarm:
36493,BOOK III.,"Then fierce Kabandha(517) long of arm,"
36494,BOOK III.,"Among the Dánavs(518) first and best,"
36495,BOOK III.,The sons of Raghu thus addressed:
36496,BOOK III.,"""What men are you, whose shoulders show"
36497,BOOK III.,"Broad as a bull's, with sword and bow,"
36498,BOOK III.,"Who roam this dark and horrid place,"
36499,BOOK III.,Brought by your fate before my face?
36500,BOOK III.,Declare by what occasion led
36501,BOOK III.,"These solitary wilds you tread,"
36502,BOOK III.,"With swords and bows and shafts to pierce,"
36503,BOOK III.,Like bulls whose horns are strong and fierce.
36504,BOOK III.,Why have you sought this forest land
36505,BOOK III.,Where wild with hunger's pangs I stand?
36506,BOOK III.,Now as your steps my path have crossed
36507,BOOK III.,"Esteem your lives already lost."""
36508,BOOK III.,
36509,BOOK III.,The royal brothers heard with dread
36510,BOOK III.,The words which fierce Kabandha said.
36511,BOOK III.,"And Ráma to his brother cried,"
36512,BOOK III.,Whose cheek by blanching fear was dried:
36513,BOOK III.,
36514,BOOK III.,"""Alas, we fall, O valiant chief,"
36515,BOOK III.,"From sorrow into direr grief,"
36516,BOOK III.,Still mourning her I hold so dear
36517,BOOK III.,We see our own destruction near.

36528,BOOK III.,
36529,BOOK III.,Thus in calm strength which naught could shake
36530,BOOK III.,"The son of Dasaratha spake,"
36531,BOOK III.,With glory yet unstained
36532,BOOK III.,Upon Sumitrá's son he bent
36533,BOOK III.,"His eyes, and firm in his intent"

36543,BOOK III.,"Imprisoned by his mighty hand,"
36544,BOOK III.,Which like a snare around him pressed
36545,BOOK III.,And thus the royal pair addressed:
36546,BOOK III.,"""Why, warriors, are your glances bent"
36547,BOOK III.,On me whom hungry pangs torment?
36548,BOOK III.,Why stand with wildered senses? Fate
36549,BOOK III.,"Has brought you now my maw to sate."""
36550,BOOK III.,

36553,BOOK III.,And to his brother by his side
36554,BOOK III.,With seasonable counsel cried:
36555,BOOK III.,
36556,BOOK III.,"""This vilest of the giant race"
36557,BOOK III.,Will draw us to his side apace.

36563,BOOK III.,With mighty force would slaughter us.
36564,BOOK III.,"But in cold blood to slay, O King,"
36565,BOOK III.,"Discredit on the brave would bring,"

36568,BOOK III.,
36569,BOOK III.,"The monstrous fiend, to anger stirred,"
36570,BOOK III.,The converse of the brothers heard.
36571,BOOK III.,His horrid mouth he opened wide
36572,BOOK III.,And drew the princes to his side.
36573,BOOK III.,"They, skilled due time and place to note"
36574,BOOK III.,"Unsheathed their glittering swords and smote,"
36575,BOOK III.,Till from the giant's shoulders they
36576,BOOK III.,Had hewn the mighty arms away.
36577,BOOK III.,His trenchant falchion Ráma plied
36578,BOOK III.,"And smote him on the better side,"
36579,BOOK III.,While valiant Lakshman on the left
36580,BOOK III.,The arm that held him prisoned cleft.
36581,BOOK III.,Then to the earth dismembered fell
36582,BOOK III.,"The monster with a hideous yell,"
36583,BOOK III.,And like a cloud's his deep roar went
36584,BOOK III.,Through earth and air and firmament.
36585,BOOK III.,"Then as the giant's blood flowed fast,"
36586,BOOK III.,"On his cleft limbs his eye he cast,"
36587,BOOK III.,And called upon the princely pair
36588,BOOK III.,Their names and lineage to declare.
36589,BOOK III.,"Him then the noble Lakshman, blest"
36590,BOOK III.,"With fortune's favouring marks, addressed,"
36591,BOOK III.,And told the fiend his brother's name
36592,BOOK III.,And the high blood of which he came:
36593,BOOK III.,"""Ikshváku's heir here Ráma stands,"
36594,BOOK III.,Illustrious through a hundred lands.
36595,BOOK III.,"I, younger brother of the heir,"
36596,BOOK III.,"O fiend, the name of Lakshman bear."
36597,BOOK III.,His mother stole his realm away
36598,BOOK III.,And drove him forth in woods to stray.
36599,BOOK III.,Thus through the mighty forest he
36600,BOOK III.,Roamed with his royal wife and me.
36601,BOOK III.,While glorious as a God he made
36602,BOOK III.,"His dwelling in the greenwood shade,"
36603,BOOK III.,"Some giant stole away his dame,"
36604,BOOK III.,And seeking her we hither came.
36605,BOOK III.,"But tell me who thou art, and why"

36614,BOOK III.,"""O welcome best of men, are ye"
36615,BOOK III.,"Whom, blest by fate, this day I see."
36616,BOOK III.,A blessing on each trenchant blade
36617,BOOK III.,That low on earth these arms has laid!
36618,BOOK III.,"Thou, lord of men, incline thine ear"

36632,BOOK III.,My fame for might and valour went.
36633,BOOK III.,"Scarce might the sun and moon on high,"
36634,BOOK III.,"Scarce Sakra, with my beauty vie."
36635,BOOK III.,"Then for a time this form I took,"
36636,BOOK III.,And the great world with trembling shook.
36637,BOOK III.,The saints in forest shades who dwelt
36638,BOOK III.,The terror of my presence felt.
36639,BOOK III.,But once I stirred to furious rage
36640,BOOK III.,"Great Sthúlasiras, glorious sage."
36641,BOOK III.,Culling in woods his hermit food
36642,BOOK III.,My hideous shape with fear he viewed.
36643,BOOK III.,Then forth his words of anger burst
36644,BOOK III.,That bade me live a thing accursed:
36645,BOOK III.,"""Thou, whose delight is others' pain,"
36646,BOOK III.,"This grisly form shalt still retain."""
36647,BOOK III.,
36648,BOOK III.,Then when I prayed him to relent
36649,BOOK III.,"And fix some term of punishment,--"
36650,BOOK III.,"Prayed that the curse at length might cease,"
36651,BOOK III.,He bade me thus expect release:
36652,BOOK III.,"""Let Ráma cleave thine arms away"
36653,BOOK III.,"And on the pyre thy body lay,"
36654,BOOK III.,"And then shalt thou, set free from doom,"

36658,BOOK III.,"By Indra's curse, subdued in fight,"
36659,BOOK III.,I wear this form which scares the sight.
36660,BOOK III.,By sternest penance long maintained
36661,BOOK III.,The mighty Father's grace I gained.
36662,BOOK III.,"When length of days the God bestowed,"
36663,BOOK III.,With foolish pride my bosom glowed.
36664,BOOK III.,"My life, of lengthened years assured,"
36665,BOOK III.,I deemed from Sakra's might secured.
36666,BOOK III.,Let by my senseless pride astray
36667,BOOK III.,I challenged Indra to the fray.
36668,BOOK III.,A flaming bolt with many a knot
36669,BOOK III.,"With his terrific arm he shot,"
36670,BOOK III.,And straight my head and thighs compressed
36671,BOOK III.,Were buried in my bulky chest.
36672,BOOK III.,Deaf to each prayer and piteous call
36673,BOOK III.,He sent me not to Yáma's hall.
36674,BOOK III.,"""Thy prayers and cries,"" he said ""are vain:"
36675,BOOK III.,"The Father's word must true remain."""
36676,BOOK III.,"""But how may lengthened life be spent"
36677,BOOK III.,By one the bolt has torn and rent?
36678,BOOK III.,"How can I live,"" I cried, ""unfed,"
36679,BOOK III.,"With shattered face and thighs and head?"""
36680,BOOK III.,"As thus I spoke his grace to crave,"
36681,BOOK III.,"Arms each a league in length he gave,"
36682,BOOK III.,And opened in my chest beneath
36683,BOOK III.,This mouth supplied with fearful teeth.
36684,BOOK III.,So my huge arms I used to cast
36685,BOOK III.,"Round woodland creatures as they passed,"
36686,BOOK III.,And fed within the forest here
36687,BOOK III.,"On lion, tiger, pard, and deer."
36688,BOOK III.,Then Indra spake to soothe my grief:
36689,BOOK III.,"""When Ráma and his brother chief"
36690,BOOK III.,"From thy huge bulk those arms shall cleave,"
36691,BOOK III.,"Then shall the skies thy soul receive."""
36692,BOOK III.,Disguised in this terrific shape
36693,BOOK III.,"I let no woodland thing escape,"
36694,BOOK III.,And still my longing soul was pleased
36695,BOOK III.,"Whene'er my arms a victim seized,"
36696,BOOK III.,For in these arms I fondly thought
36697,BOOK III.,Would Ráma's self at last be caught.
36698,BOOK III.,"Thus hoping, toiling many a day"
36699,BOOK III.,"I yearned to cast my life away,"
36700,BOOK III.,"And here, my lord, thou standest now:"
36701,BOOK III.,Blessings be thine! for none but thou
36702,BOOK III.,Could cleave my arms with trenchant stroke:
36703,BOOK III.,True are the words the hermit spoke.
36704,BOOK III.,"Now let me, best of warriors, lend"
36705,BOOK III.,"My counsel, and thy plans befriend,"
36706,BOOK III.,And aid thee with advice in turn
36707,BOOK III.,"If thou with fire my corse wilt burn."""
36708,BOOK III.,
36709,BOOK III.,As thus the mighty Danu prayed
36710,BOOK III.,"With offer of his friendly aid,"
36711,BOOK III.,"While Lakshman gazed with anxious eye,"
36712,BOOK III.,The virtuous Ráma made reply:
36713,BOOK III.,"""Lakshman and I through forest shade"
36714,BOOK III.,From Janasthán a while had strayed.
36715,BOOK III.,"When none was near her, Rávan came"
36716,BOOK III.,"And bore away my glorious dame,"
36717,BOOK III.,"The giant's form and size unknown,"
36718,BOOK III.,I learn as yet his name alone.
36719,BOOK III.,Not yet the power and might we know

36729,BOOK III.,Do thou as meed of this declare
36730,BOOK III.,"Who stole my spouse, his dwelling where."
36731,BOOK III.,"O, if thou can, I pray thee say,"
36732,BOOK III.,"And let this grace our deeds repay."""
36733,BOOK III.,
36734,BOOK III.,Danu had lent attentive ear

36736,BOOK III.,"And thus, a speaker skilled and tried,"
36737,BOOK III.,To that great orator replied:
36738,BOOK III.,"""No heavenly lore my soul endows,"
36739,BOOK III.,Naught know I of thy Maithil spouse.
36740,BOOK III.,"Yet will I, when my shape I wear,"
36741,BOOK III.,Him who will tell thee all declare.
36742,BOOK III.,"Then, Ráma, will my lips disclose"
36743,BOOK III.,His name who well that giant knows.
36744,BOOK III.,But till the flames my corse devour
36745,BOOK III.,This hidden knowledge mocks my power.
36746,BOOK III.,For through that curse's withering taint
36747,BOOK III.,My knowledge now is small and faint.
36748,BOOK III.,Unknown the giant's very name
36749,BOOK III.,Who bore away the Maithil dame.
36750,BOOK III.,Cursed for my evil deeds I wore

36753,BOOK III.,"Through western skies his course have run,"

36779,BOOK III.,Then Lakshman in his mighty hands
36780,BOOK III.,"Brought ample store of lighted brands,"
36781,BOOK III.,And to a pile of logs applied
36782,BOOK III.,The flame that ran from side to side.
36783,BOOK III.,The spreading glow with gentle force
36784,BOOK III.,"Consumed Kabandha's mighty corse,"
36785,BOOK III.,Till the unresting flames had drunk
36786,BOOK III.,"The marrow of the monstrous trunk,"
36787,BOOK III.,As balls of butter melt away
36788,BOOK III.,Amid the fires that o'er them play.
36789,BOOK III.,"Then from the pyre, like flame that glows"
36790,BOOK III.,"Undimmed by cloudy smoke, he rose,"
36791,BOOK III.,"In garments pure of spot or speck,"
36792,BOOK III.,A heavenly wreath about his neck.
36793,BOOK III.,Resplendent in his bright attire
36794,BOOK III.,He sprang exultant from the pyre.
36795,BOOK III.,"While from neck, arm, and foot was sent"

36797,BOOK III.,"High on a chariot, bright of hue,"

36799,BOOK III.,He filled each region of the air
36800,BOOK III.,With splendid glow reflected there.
36801,BOOK III.,Then in the sky he stayed his car

36931,BOOK III.,Your happy eyes at length will rest
36932,BOOK III.,On Pampá's lotus-covered breast.
36933,BOOK III.,"Her banks with gentle slope descend,"
36934,BOOK III.,"Nor stones nor weed the eyes offend,"
36935,BOOK III.,And o'er smooth beds of silver sand
36936,BOOK III.,Lotus and lily blooms expand.
36937,BOOK III.,"There swans and ducks and curlews play,"
36938,BOOK III.,"And keen-eyed ospreys watch their prey,"
36939,BOOK III.,And from the limpid waves are heard
36940,BOOK III.,Glad notes of many a water-bird.
36941,BOOK III.,Untaught a deadly foe to fear
36942,BOOK III.,"They fly not when a man is near,"
36943,BOOK III.,And fat as balls of butter they
36944,BOOK III.,"Will, when you list, your hunger stay."
36945,BOOK III.,Then Lakshman with his shafts will take
36946,BOOK III.,"The fish that swim the brook and lake,"
36947,BOOK III.,"Remove each bone and scale and fin,"
36948,BOOK III.,"Or strip away the speckled skin,"
36949,BOOK III.,And then on iron skewers broil
36950,BOOK III.,For thy repast the savoury spoil.
36951,BOOK III.,Thou on a heap of flowers shalt rest
36952,BOOK III.,"And eat the meal his hands have dressed,"
36953,BOOK III.,"There shalt thou lie on Pampá's brink,"
36954,BOOK III.,"And Lakshman's hand shall give thee drink,"
36955,BOOK III.,Filling a lotus leaf with cool
36956,BOOK III.,"Pure water from the crystal pool,"
36957,BOOK III.,To which the opening blooms have lent
36958,BOOK III.,The riches of divinest scent.
36959,BOOK III.,Beside thee at the close of day
36960,BOOK III.,"Will Lakshman through the woodland stray,"
36961,BOOK III.,And show thee where the monkeys sleep
36962,BOOK III.,In caves beneath the mountain steep.
36963,BOOK III.,Loud-voiced as bulls they forth will burst
36964,BOOK III.,"And seek the flood, oppressed by thirst;"
36965,BOOK III.,"Then rest a while, their wants supplied,"
36966,BOOK III.,Their well-fed bands on Pampá's side.
36967,BOOK III.,Thou roving there at eve shalt see
36968,BOOK III.,"Rich clusters hang on shrub and tree,"
36969,BOOK III.,"And Pampá flushed with roseate glow,"
36970,BOOK III.,And at the view forget thy woe.
36971,BOOK III.,There shalt thou mark with strange delight
36972,BOOK III.,"Each loveliest flower that blooms by night,"
36973,BOOK III.,While lily buds that shrink from day
36974,BOOK III.,Their tender loveliness display.
36975,BOOK III.,In that far wild no hand but thine
36976,BOOK III.,Those peerless flowers in wreaths shall twine:
36977,BOOK III.,"Immortal in their changeless pride,"
36978,BOOK III.,Ne'er fade those blooms and ne'er are dried.
36979,BOOK III.,There erst on holy thoughts intent
36980,BOOK III.,Their days Matanga's pupils spent.
36981,BOOK III.,"Once for their master food they sought,"
36982,BOOK III.,And store of fruit and berries brought.
36983,BOOK III.,Then as they laboured through the dell
36984,BOOK III.,From limb and brow the heat-drops fell:
36985,BOOK III.,Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees:
36986,BOOK III.,Such holy power have devotees.
36987,BOOK III.,"Thus, from the hermits' heat-drops sprung,"
36988,BOOK III.,Their growth is ever fresh and young.
36989,BOOK III.,"There Savarí is dwelling yet,"
36990,BOOK III.,Who served each vanished anchoret.
36991,BOOK III.,Beneath the shade of holy boughs
36992,BOOK III.,That ancient votaress keeps her vows.
36993,BOOK III.,"Her happy eyes on thee will fall,"
36994,BOOK III.,"O godlike prince, adored by all,"
36995,BOOK III.,"And she, whose life is pure from sin,"
36996,BOOK III.,A blissful seat in heaven will win.
36997,BOOK III.,"But cross, O son of Raghu, o'er,"
36998,BOOK III.,And stand on Pampá's western shore.
36999,BOOK III.,A tranquil hermitage that lies
37000,BOOK III.,Deep in the woods will meet thine eyes.
37001,BOOK III.,No wandering elephants invade
37002,BOOK III.,"The stillness of that holy shade,"
37003,BOOK III.,But checked by saint Matanga's power
37004,BOOK III.,They spare each consecrated bower.
37005,BOOK III.,Through many an age those trees have stood
37006,BOOK III.,World-famous as Matanga's wood
37007,BOOK III.,"Still, Raghu's son, pursue thy way:"
37008,BOOK III.,"Through shades where birds are vocal stray,"
37009,BOOK III.,Fair as the blessed wood where rove
37010,BOOK III.,"Immortal Gods, or Nandan's grove."
37011,BOOK III.,"Near Pampá eastward, full in sight,"
37012,BOOK III.,Stands Rishyamúka's wood-crowned height.
37013,BOOK III.,'Tis hard to climb that towering steep
37014,BOOK III.,Where serpents unmolested sleep.
37015,BOOK III.,"The free and bounteous, formed of old"
37016,BOOK III.,"By Brahmá of superior mould,"
37017,BOOK III.,Who sink when day is done to rest
37018,BOOK III.,"Reclining on that mountain crest,--"
37019,BOOK III.,"What wealth or joy in dreams they view,"
37020,BOOK III.,Awaking find the vision true.
37021,BOOK III.,But if a villain stained with crime
37022,BOOK III.,"That holy hill presume to climb,"
37023,BOOK III.,The giants in their fury sweep
37024,BOOK III.,From the hill top the wretch asleep.
37025,BOOK III.,There loud and long is heard the roar
37026,BOOK III.,"Of elephants on Pampá's shore,"
37027,BOOK III.,Who near Matanga's dwelling stray
37028,BOOK III.,And in those waters bathe and play.
37029,BOOK III.,"A while they revel by the flood,"
37030,BOOK III.,"Their temples stained with streams like blood,"
37031,BOOK III.,"Then wander far away dispersed,"
37032,BOOK III.,Dark as huge clouds before they burst.
37033,BOOK III.,But ere they part they drink their fill
37034,BOOK III.,"Of bright pure water from the rill,"
37035,BOOK III.,"Delightful to the touch, where meet"
37036,BOOK III.,"Scents of all flowers divinely sweet,"
37037,BOOK III.,Then speeding from the river side
37038,BOOK III.,Deep in the sheltering thicket hide.
37039,BOOK III.,Then bears and tigers shalt thou view
37040,BOOK III.,"Whose soft skins show the sapphire's hue,"
37041,BOOK III.,And silvan deer that wander nigh
37042,BOOK III.,Shall harmless from thy presence fly.
37043,BOOK III.,High in that mountain's wooded side
37044,BOOK III.,"Is a fair cavern deep and wide,"
37045,BOOK III.,Yet hard to enter: piles of rock
37046,BOOK III.,The portals of the cavern block.(521)
37047,BOOK III.,Fast by the eastern door a pool
37048,BOOK III.,"Gleams with broad waters fresh and cool,"
37049,BOOK III.,"Where stores of roots and fruit abound,"
37050,BOOK III.,And thick trees shade the grassy ground.
37051,BOOK III.,This mountain cave the virtuous-souled
37052,BOOK III.,"Sugríva, and his Vánars hold,"
37053,BOOK III.,And oft the mighty chieftain seeks
37054,BOOK III.,"The summits of those towering peaks."""
37055,BOOK III.,
37056,BOOK III.,Thus spake Kabandha high in air
37057,BOOK III.,His counsel to the royal pair.
37058,BOOK III.,"Still on his neck that wreath he bore,"
37059,BOOK III.,And radiance like the sun's he wore.
37060,BOOK III.,Their eyes the princely brothers raised
37061,BOOK III.,And on that blissful being gazed:
37062,BOOK III.,"""Behold, we go: no more delay;"
37063,BOOK III.,"Begin,"" they cried, ""thy heavenward way."""
37064,BOOK III.,"""Depart,"" Kabandha's voice replied,"
37065,BOOK III.,"""Pursue your search, and bliss betide."""
37066,BOOK III.,
37067,BOOK III.,"Thus to the happy chiefs he said,"
37068,BOOK III.,Then on his heavenward journey sped.
37069,BOOK III.,Thus once again Kabandha won
37070,BOOK III.,A shape that glittered like the sun
37071,BOOK III.,Without a spot or stain.
37072,BOOK III.,Thus bade he Ráma from the air
37073,BOOK III.,To great Sugríva's side repair
37074,BOOK III.,His friendly love to gain.

37080,BOOK III.,
37081,BOOK III.,
37082,BOOK III.,Thus counselled by their friendly guide
37083,BOOK III.,"On through the wood the princes hied,"
37084,BOOK III.,Pursuing still the eastern road
37085,BOOK III.,"To Pampá which Kabandha showed,"
37086,BOOK III.,Where trees that on the mountains grew
37087,BOOK III.,With fruit like honey charmed the view.
37088,BOOK III.,They rested weary for the night
37089,BOOK III.,"Upon a mountain's wooded height,"
37090,BOOK III.,Then onward with the dawn they hied
37091,BOOK III.,"And stood on Pampá's western side,"
37092,BOOK III.,Where Savarí's fair home they viewed
37093,BOOK III.,Deep in that shady solitude.
37094,BOOK III.,The princes reached the holy ground
37095,BOOK III.,"Where noble trees stood thick around,"
37096,BOOK III.,And joying in the lovely view
37097,BOOK III.,Near to the aged votaress drew.
37098,BOOK III.,"To meet the sons of Raghu came,"
37099,BOOK III.,"With hands upraised, the pious dame,"
37100,BOOK III.,And bending low with reverence meet
37101,BOOK III.,Welcomed them both and pressed their feet.
37102,BOOK III.,"Then water, as beseems, she gave,"
37103,BOOK III.,"Their lips to cool, their feet to lave."
37104,BOOK III.,To that pure saint who never broke
37105,BOOK III.,One law of duty Ráma spoke:
37106,BOOK III.,
37107,BOOK III.,"""I trust no cares invade thy peace,"
37108,BOOK III.,While holy works and zeal increase;
37109,BOOK III.,That thou content with scanty food
37110,BOOK III.,All touch of ire hast long subdued;
37111,BOOK III.,That all thy vows are well maintained
37112,BOOK III.,"While peace of mind is surely gained,"
37113,BOOK III.,That reverence of the saints who taught
37114,BOOK III.,"Thy faithful heart due fruit has brought."""
37115,BOOK III.,
37116,BOOK III.,"The aged votaress pure of taint,"
37117,BOOK III.,"Revered by every perfect saint,"
37118,BOOK III.,Rose to her feet by Ráma's side
37119,BOOK III.,And thus in gentle tones replied:
37120,BOOK III.,"""My penance meed this day I see"
37121,BOOK III.,"Complete, my lord, in meeting thee."
37122,BOOK III.,"This day the fruit of birth I gain,"
37123,BOOK III.,Nor have I served the saints in vain.
37124,BOOK III.,"I reap rich fruits of toil and vow,"
37125,BOOK III.,"And heaven itself awaits me now,"
37126,BOOK III.,"When I, O chief of men, have done"
37127,BOOK III.,Honour to thee the godlike one.
37128,BOOK III.,"I feel, great lord, thy gentle eye"
37129,BOOK III.,"My earthly spirit purify,"
37130,BOOK III.,"And I, brave tamer of thy foes,"
37131,BOOK III.,Shall through thy grace in bliss repose.
37132,BOOK III.,Thy feet by Chitrakúta strayed
37133,BOOK III.,"When those great saints whom I obeyed,"
37134,BOOK III.,"In dazzling chariots bright of hue,"
37135,BOOK III.,Hence to their heavenly mansions flew.
37136,BOOK III.,As the high saints were borne away
37137,BOOK III.,I heard their holy voices say:
37138,BOOK III.,"""In this pure grove, O devotee,"
37139,BOOK III.,Prince Ráma soon will visit thee.
37140,BOOK III.,"When he and Lakshman seek this shade,"
37141,BOOK III.,Be to thy guests all honour paid.
37142,BOOK III.,"Him shalt thou see, and pass away"
37143,BOOK III.,"To those blest worlds which ne'er decay."""
37144,BOOK III.,"To me, O mighty chief, the best"
37145,BOOK III.,Of lofty saints these words addressed.
37146,BOOK III.,Laid up within my dwelling lie
37147,BOOK III.,"Fruits of each sort which woods supply,--"
37148,BOOK III.,Food culled for thee in endless store
37149,BOOK III.,"From every tree on Pampá's shore."""
37150,BOOK III.,
37151,BOOK III.,Thus to her virtuous guest she sued
37152,BOOK III.,"And he, with heavenly lore endued,"
37153,BOOK III.,Words such as these in turn addressed
37154,BOOK III.,To her with equal knowledge blest:
37155,BOOK III.,"""Danu himself the power has told"
37156,BOOK III.,Of thy great masters lofty-souled.
37157,BOOK III.,"Now if thou will, mine eyes would fain"
37158,BOOK III.,"Assurance of their glories gain."""
37159,BOOK III.,
37160,BOOK III.,She heard the prince his wish declare:
37161,BOOK III.,"Then rose she, and the royal pair"
37162,BOOK III.,Of brothers through the wood she led
37163,BOOK III.,That round her holy dwelling spread.
37164,BOOK III.,"""Behold Matanga's wood"" she cried,"
37165,BOOK III.,"""A grove made famous far and wide."
37166,BOOK III.,Dark as thick clouds and filled with herds
37167,BOOK III.,"Of wandering deer, and joyous birds."
37168,BOOK III.,In this pure spot each reverend sire
37169,BOOK III.,With offerings fed the holy fire.
37170,BOOK III.,See here the western altar stands
37171,BOOK III.,Where daily with their trembling hands
37172,BOOK III.,"The aged saints, so long obeyed"
37173,BOOK III.,"By me, their gifts of blossoms laid."
37174,BOOK III.,"The holy power, O Raghu's son,"
37175,BOOK III.,"By their ascetic virtue won,"
37176,BOOK III.,"Still keeps their well-loved altar bright,"
37177,BOOK III.,Filling the air with beams of light.
37178,BOOK III.,And those seven neighbouring lakes behold
37179,BOOK III.,"Which, when the saints infirm and old,"
37180,BOOK III.,"Worn out by fasts, no longer sought,"
37181,BOOK III.,Moved hither drawn by power of thought.
37182,BOOK III.,"Look, Ráma, where the devotees"
37183,BOOK III.,"Hung their bark mantles on the trees,"
37184,BOOK III.,Fresh from the bath: those garments wet
37185,BOOK III.,Through many a day are dripping yet.
37186,BOOK III.,"See, through those aged hermits' power"
37187,BOOK III.,"The tender spray, this bright-hued flower"
37188,BOOK III.,"With which the saints their worship paid,"
37189,BOOK III.,Fresh to this hour nor change nor fade.
37190,BOOK III.,"Here thou hast seen each lawn and dell,"
37191,BOOK III.,And heard the tale I had to tell:
37192,BOOK III.,"Permit thy servant, lord, I pray,"
37193,BOOK III.,"To cast this mortal shell away,"
37194,BOOK III.,"For I would dwell, this life resigned,"
37195,BOOK III.,"With those great saints of lofty mind,"
37196,BOOK III.,Whom I within this holy shade
37197,BOOK III.,"With reverential care obeyed."""
37198,BOOK III.,
37199,BOOK III.,When Ráma and his brother heard
37200,BOOK III.,"The pious prayer the dame preferred,"
37201,BOOK III.,Filled full of transport and amazed
37202,BOOK III.,They marvelled as her words they praised.
37203,BOOK III.,Then Ráma to the votaress said
37204,BOOK III.,Whose holy vows were perfected:
37205,BOOK III.,"""Go, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,"
37206,BOOK III.,"O thou who well hast honoured me."""
37207,BOOK III.,
37208,BOOK III.,"Her locks in hermit fashion tied,"
37209,BOOK III.,"Clad in bark coat and black deer-hide,"
37210,BOOK III.,"When Ráma gave consent, the dame"
37211,BOOK III.,Resigned her body to the flame.
37212,BOOK III.,"Then like the fire that burns and glows,"
37213,BOOK III.,"To heaven the sainted lady rose,"
37214,BOOK III.,"In all her heavenly garments dressed,"
37215,BOOK III.,"Immortal wreaths on neck and breast,"
37216,BOOK III.,Bright with celestial gems she shone
37217,BOOK III.,"Most beautiful to look upon,"
37218,BOOK III.,And like the flame of lightning sent
37219,BOOK III.,A glory through the firmament.
37220,BOOK III.,"That holy sphere the dame attained,"
37221,BOOK III.,"By depth of contemplation gained,"
37222,BOOK III.,Where roam high saints with spirits pure
37223,BOOK III.,In bliss that shall for aye endure.

37229,BOOK III.,
37230,BOOK III.,
37231,BOOK III.,When Savarí had sought the skies
37232,BOOK III.,"And gained her splendid virtue's prize,"
37233,BOOK III.,Ráma with Lakshman stayed to brood
37234,BOOK III.,O'er the strange scenes their eyes had viewed.
37235,BOOK III.,"His mind upon those saints was bent,"
37236,BOOK III.,For power and might preëminent
37237,BOOK III.,And he to musing Lakshman spoke
37238,BOOK III.,The thoughts that in his bosom woke:
37239,BOOK III.,"""Mine eyes this wondrous home have viewed"
37240,BOOK III.,"Of those great saints with souls subdued,"
37241,BOOK III.,"Where peaceful tigers dwell and birds,"
37242,BOOK III.,And deer abound in heedless herds.
37243,BOOK III.,Our feet upon the banks have stood
37244,BOOK III.,"Of those seven lakes within the wood,"
37245,BOOK III.,"Where we have duly dipped, and paid"
37246,BOOK III.,Libations to each royal shade.
37247,BOOK III.,Forgotten now are thoughts of ill
37248,BOOK III.,And joyful hopes my bosom fill.
37249,BOOK III.,Again my heart is light and gay
37250,BOOK III.,And grief and care have passed away.
37251,BOOK III.,"Come, brother, let us hasten where"
37252,BOOK III.,"Bright Pampá's flood is fresh and fair,"
37253,BOOK III.,And towering in their beauty near
37254,BOOK III.,"Mount Rishyamúka's heights appear,"
37255,BOOK III.,"Which, offspring of the Lord of Light,"
37256,BOOK III.,"Still fearing Báli's conquering might,"
37257,BOOK III.,With four brave chiefs of Vánar race
37258,BOOK III.,Sugríva makes his dwelling-place.
37259,BOOK III.,I long with eager heart to find
37260,BOOK III.,"That leader of the Vánar kind,"
37261,BOOK III.,For on that chief my hopes depend
37262,BOOK III.,"That this our quest have prosperous end."""
37263,BOOK III.,
37264,BOOK III.,"Thus Ráma spoke, in battle tried,"
37265,BOOK III.,And thus Sumitrá's son replied:
37266,BOOK III.,"""Come, brother, come, and speed away:"
37267,BOOK III.,"My spirit brooks no more delay."""
37268,BOOK III.,"Thus spake Sumitrá's son, and then"
37269,BOOK III.,Forth from the grove the king of men
37270,BOOK III.,With his dear brother by his side
37271,BOOK III.,To Pampá's lucid waters hied.
37272,BOOK III.,He gazed upon the woods where grew
37273,BOOK III.,Trees rich in flowers of every hue.
37274,BOOK III.,From brake and dell on every side
37275,BOOK III.,"The curlew and the peacock cried,"
37276,BOOK III.,And flocks of screaming parrots made
37277,BOOK III.,Shrill music in the bloomy shade.
37278,BOOK III.,"His eager eyes, as on he went,"
37279,BOOK III.,On many a pool and tree were bent.
37280,BOOK III.,Inflamed with love he journeyed on
37281,BOOK III.,Till a fair flood before him shone.
37282,BOOK III.,He stood upon the water's side
37283,BOOK III.,Which streams from distant hills supplied:
37284,BOOK III.,Matanga's name that water bore:
37285,BOOK III.,There bathed he from the shelving shore.
37286,BOOK III.,"Then, each on earnest thoughts intent,"
37287,BOOK III.,Still farther on their way they went.
37288,BOOK III.,But Ráma's heart once more gave way
37289,BOOK III.,Beneath his grief and wild dismay.
37290,BOOK III.,Before him lay the noble flood
37291,BOOK III.,Adorned with many a lotus bud.
37292,BOOK III.,"On its fair banks Asoka glowed,"
37293,BOOK III.,And all bright trees their blossoms showed.
37294,BOOK III.,Green banks that silver waves confined
37295,BOOK III.,With lovely groves were fringed and lined.
37296,BOOK III.,The crystal waters in their flow
37297,BOOK III.,Showed level sands that gleamed below.
37298,BOOK III.,"There glittering fish and tortoise played,"
37299,BOOK III.,And bending trees gave pleasant shade.
37300,BOOK III.,There creepers on the branches hung
37301,BOOK III.,With lover-like embraces clung.
37302,BOOK III.,"There gay Gandharvas loved to meet,"
37303,BOOK III.,And Kinnars sought the calm retreat.
37304,BOOK III.,"There wandering Yakshas found delight,"
37305,BOOK III.,Snake-gods and rovers of the night.
37306,BOOK III.,"Cool were the pleasant waters, gay"
37307,BOOK III.,"Each tree with creeper, flower, and spray."
37308,BOOK III.,"There flushed the lotus darkly red,"
37309,BOOK III.,"Here their white glory lilies spread,"
37310,BOOK III.,Here sweet buds showed their tints of blue:
37311,BOOK III.,So carpets gleam with many a hue.
37312,BOOK III.,"A grove of Mangoes blossomed nigh,"
37313,BOOK III.,Echoing with the peacock's cry.
37314,BOOK III.,When Ráma by his brother's side
37315,BOOK III.,"The lovely flood of Pampá eyed,"
37316,BOOK III.,"Decked like a beauty, fair to see"
37317,BOOK III.,"With every charm of flower and tree,"
37318,BOOK III.,His mighty heart with woe was rent
37319,BOOK III.,And thus he spoke in wild lament
37320,BOOK III.,
37321,BOOK III.,"""Here, Lakshman, on this beauteous shore,"
37322,BOOK III.,"Stands, dyed with tints of many an ore,"
37323,BOOK III.,The mountain Rishyamúka bright
37324,BOOK III.,With flowery trees that crown each height.
37325,BOOK III.,"Sprung from the chief who, famed of yore,"
37326,BOOK III.,"The name of Riksharajas bore,"
37327,BOOK III.,"Sugríva, chieftain strong and dread,"
37328,BOOK III.,Dwells on that mountain's towering head.
37329,BOOK III.,"Go to him, best of men, and seek"
37330,BOOK III.,"That prince of Vánars on the peak,"
37331,BOOK III.,"I cannot longer brook my pain,"
37332,BOOK III.,"Or, Sítá lost, my life retain."""
37333,BOOK III.,"Thus by the pangs of love distressed,"
37334,BOOK III.,"His thoughts on Sítá bent,"
37335,BOOK III.,"His faithful brother he addressed,"
37336,BOOK III.,And cried in wild lament.
37337,BOOK III.,He reached the lovely ground that lay
37338,BOOK III.,"On Pampá's wooded side,"
37339,BOOK III.,"And told in anguish and dismay,"
37340,BOOK III.,The grief he could not hide.
37341,BOOK III.,With listless footsteps faint and slow
37342,BOOK III.,"His way the chief pursued,"
37343,BOOK III.,Till Pampá with her glorious show
37344,BOOK III.,Of flowering woods he viewed.
37345,BOOK III.,Through shades where every bird was found
37346,BOOK III.,"The prince with Lakshman passed,"
37347,BOOK III.,And Pampá with her groves around
37348,BOOK III.,Burst on his eyes at last.

37360,BOOK IV.,
37361,BOOK IV.,
37362,BOOK IV.,The princes stood by Pampá's side(522)
37363,BOOK IV.,Which blooming lilies glorified.
37364,BOOK IV.,With troubled heart and sense o'erthrown
37365,BOOK IV.,There Ráma made his piteous moan.
37366,BOOK IV.,As the fair flood before him lay
37367,BOOK IV.,The reason of the chief gave way;
37368,BOOK IV.,"And tender thoughts within him woke,"
37369,BOOK IV.,As to Sumitrá's son he spoke:
37370,BOOK IV.,
37371,BOOK IV.,"""How lovely Pampá's waters show,"
37372,BOOK IV.,Where streams of lucid crystal flow!
37373,BOOK IV.,What glorious trees o'erhang the flood
37374,BOOK IV.,Which blooms of opening lotus stud!
37375,BOOK IV.,Look on the banks of Pampá where
37376,BOOK IV.,Thick groves extend divinely fair;
37377,BOOK IV.,"And piles of trees, like hills in size,"
37378,BOOK IV.,Lift their proud summits to the skies.
37379,BOOK IV.,"But thought of Bharat's(523) pain and toil,"
37380,BOOK IV.,"And my dear spouse the giant's spoil,"
37381,BOOK IV.,Afflict my tortured heart and press
37382,BOOK IV.,My spirit down with heaviness.
37383,BOOK IV.,Still fair to me though sunk in woe
37384,BOOK IV.,Bright Pampá and her forest show.
37385,BOOK IV.,"Where cool fresh waters charm the sight,"
37386,BOOK IV.,And flowers of every hue are bright.
37387,BOOK IV.,The lotuses in close array
37388,BOOK IV.,"Their passing loveliness display,"
37389,BOOK IV.,"And pard and tiger, deer and snake"
37390,BOOK IV.,Haunt every glade and dell and brake.
37391,BOOK IV.,Those grassy spots display the hue
37392,BOOK IV.,"Of topazes and sapphires' blue,"
37393,BOOK IV.,"And, gay with flowers of every dye,"
37394,BOOK IV.,With richly broidered housings vie.
37395,BOOK IV.,"What loads of bloom the high trees crown,"
37396,BOOK IV.,Or weigh the bending branches down!
37397,BOOK IV.,And creepers tipped with bud and flower
37398,BOOK IV.,Each spray and loaded limb o'erpower.
37399,BOOK IV.,"Now cool delicious breezes blow,"
37400,BOOK IV.,"And kindle love's voluptuous glow,"
37401,BOOK IV.,"When balmy sweetness fills the air,"
37402,BOOK IV.,And fruit and flowers and trees are fair.
37403,BOOK IV.,"Those waving woods, that shine with bloom,"
37404,BOOK IV.,Each varied tint in turn assume.
37405,BOOK IV.,Like labouring clouds they pour their showers
37406,BOOK IV.,In rain or ever-changing flowers.
37407,BOOK IV.,"Behold, those forest trees, that stand"
37408,BOOK IV.,"High upon rock and table-land,"
37409,BOOK IV.,"As the cool gales their branches bend,"
37410,BOOK IV.,Their floating blossoms downward send.
37411,BOOK IV.,"See, Lakshman, how the breezes play"
37412,BOOK IV.,With every floweret on the spray.
37413,BOOK IV.,And sport in merry guise with all
37414,BOOK IV.,The fallen blooms and those that fall.
37415,BOOK IV.,"See, brother, where the merry breeze"
37416,BOOK IV.,"Shakes the gay boughs of flowery trees,"
37417,BOOK IV.,Disturbed amid their toil a throng
37418,BOOK IV.,"Of bees pursue him, loud in song."
37419,BOOK IV.,"The Koďls,(524) mad with sweet delight,"
37420,BOOK IV.,The bending trees to dance invite;
37421,BOOK IV.,And in its joy the wild wind sings
37422,BOOK IV.,As from the mountain cave he springs.
37423,BOOK IV.,"On speed the gales in rapid course,"
37424,BOOK IV.,"And bend the woods beneath their force,"
37425,BOOK IV.,Till every branch and spray they bind
37426,BOOK IV.,In many a tangled knot entwined.
37427,BOOK IV.,What balmy sweets those gales dispense
37428,BOOK IV.,With cool and sacred influence!
37429,BOOK IV.,Fatigue and trouble vanish: such
37430,BOOK IV.,The magic of their gentle touch.
37431,BOOK IV.,"Hark, when the gale the boughs has bent"
37432,BOOK IV.,"In woods of honey redolent,"
37433,BOOK IV.,Through all their quivering sprays the trees
37434,BOOK IV.,Are vocal with the murmuring bees.
37435,BOOK IV.,"The hills with towering summits rise,"
37436,BOOK IV.,"And with their beauty charm the eyes,"
37437,BOOK IV.,Gay with the giant trees which bright
37438,BOOK IV.,With blossom spring from every height:
37439,BOOK IV.,And as the soft wind gently sways
37440,BOOK IV.,"The clustering blooms that load the sprays,"
37441,BOOK IV.,The very trees break forth and sing
37442,BOOK IV.,With startled wild bees' murmuring.
37443,BOOK IV.,Thine eyes to yonder Cassias(525) turn
37444,BOOK IV.,Whose glorious clusters glow and burn.
37445,BOOK IV.,"Those trees in yellow robes behold,"
37446,BOOK IV.,Like giants decked with burnished gold.
37447,BOOK IV.,"Ah me, Sumitrá's son, the spring"
37448,BOOK IV.,"Dear to sweet birds who love and sing,"
37449,BOOK IV.,Wakes in my lonely breast the flame
37450,BOOK IV.,Of sorrow as I mourn my dame.
37451,BOOK IV.,"Love strikes me through with darts of fire,"
37452,BOOK IV.,And wakes in vain the sweet desire.
37453,BOOK IV.,"Hark, the loud Koďl swells his throat,"
37454,BOOK IV.,And mocks me with his joyful note.
37455,BOOK IV.,I hear the happy wild-cock call
37456,BOOK IV.,Beside the shady waterfall.
37457,BOOK IV.,His cry of joy afflicts my breast
37458,BOOK IV.,By love's absorbing might possessed.
37459,BOOK IV.,My darling from our cottage heard
37460,BOOK IV.,"One morn in spring this shrill-toned bird,"
37461,BOOK IV.,And called me in her joy to hear
37462,BOOK IV.,The happy cry that charmed her ear.
37463,BOOK IV.,"See, birds of every varied voice"
37464,BOOK IV.,"Around us in the woods rejoice,"
37465,BOOK IV.,"On creeper, shrub, and plant alight,"
37466,BOOK IV.,Or wing from tree to tree their flight.
37467,BOOK IV.,"Each bird his kindly mate has found,"
37468,BOOK IV.,"And loud their notes of triumph sound,"
37469,BOOK IV.,Blending in sweetest music like
37470,BOOK IV.,The distant warblings of the shrike.
37471,BOOK IV.,See how the river banks are lined
37472,BOOK IV.,With birds of every hue and kind.
37473,BOOK IV.,"Here in his joy the Koďl sings,"
37474,BOOK IV.,There the glad wild-cock flaps his wings.
37475,BOOK IV.,The blooms of bright Asokas(526) where
37476,BOOK IV.,"The song of wild bees fills the air,"
37477,BOOK IV.,And the soft whisper of the boughs
37478,BOOK IV.,Increase my longing for my spouse.
37479,BOOK IV.,The vernal flush of flower and spray
37480,BOOK IV.,Will burn my very soul away.
37481,BOOK IV.,"What use, what care have I for life"
37482,BOOK IV.,If I no more may see my wife
37483,BOOK IV.,"Soft speaker with the glorious hair,"
37484,BOOK IV.,And eyes with silken lashes fair?
37485,BOOK IV.,Now is the time when all day long
37486,BOOK IV.,The Koďls fill the woods with song.
37487,BOOK IV.,And gardens bloom at spring's sweet touch
37488,BOOK IV.,Which my beloved loved so much.
37489,BOOK IV.,"Ah me, Sumitrá's son, the fire"
37490,BOOK IV.,"Of sorrow, sprung from soft desire,"
37491,BOOK IV.,"Fanned by the charms the spring time shows,"
37492,BOOK IV.,"Will burn my heart and end my woes,"
37493,BOOK IV.,"Whose sad eyes look on each fair tree,"
37494,BOOK IV.,But my sweet love no more may see.
37495,BOOK IV.,"Ah me, Ah me, from hour to hour"
37496,BOOK IV.,"Love in my soul will wax in power,"
37497,BOOK IV.,"And spring, upon whose charms I gaze,"
37498,BOOK IV.,"Whose breath the heat of toil allays,"
37499,BOOK IV.,With thoughts of her for whom I strain
37500,BOOK IV.,"My hopeless eyes, increase my pain."
37501,BOOK IV.,As fire in summer rages through
37502,BOOK IV.,"The forests thick with dry bamboo,"
37503,BOOK IV.,So will my fawn eyed love consume
37504,BOOK IV.,My soul o'erwhelmed with thoughts of gloom.
37505,BOOK IV.,"Behold, beneath each spreading tree"
37506,BOOK IV.,"The peacocks dance(527) in frantic glee,"
37507,BOOK IV.,"And, stirred by all the gales that blow,"
37508,BOOK IV.,"Their tails with jewelled windows glow,"
37509,BOOK IV.,"Each bird, in happy love elate,"
37510,BOOK IV.,Rejoices with his darling mate.
37511,BOOK IV.,But sights like these of joy and peace
37512,BOOK IV.,My pangs of hopeless love increase.
37513,BOOK IV.,See on the mountain slope above
37514,BOOK IV.,The peahen languishing with love.
37515,BOOK IV.,Behold her now in amorous dance
37516,BOOK IV.,Close to her consort's side advance.
37517,BOOK IV.,He with a laugh of joy and pride
37518,BOOK IV.,Displays his glittering pinions wide;
37519,BOOK IV.,And follows through the tangled dell
37520,BOOK IV.,The partner whom he loves so well.
37521,BOOK IV.,Ah happy bird! no giant's hate
37522,BOOK IV.,Has robbed him of his tender mate;
37523,BOOK IV.,And still beside his loved one he
37524,BOOK IV.,Dances beneath the shade in glee.
37525,BOOK IV.,"Ah, in this month when flowers are fair"
37526,BOOK IV.,My widowed woe is hard to bear.
37527,BOOK IV.,"See, gentle love a home may find"
37528,BOOK IV.,In creatures of inferior kind.
37529,BOOK IV.,See how the peahen turns to meet
37530,BOOK IV.,Her consort now with love-drawn feet.
37531,BOOK IV.,"So, Lakshman, if my large-eyed dear,"
37532,BOOK IV.,"The child of Janak still were here,"
37533,BOOK IV.,"She, by love's thrilling influence led,"
37534,BOOK IV.,Upon my breast would lay her head.
37535,BOOK IV.,These blooms I gathered from the bough
37536,BOOK IV.,Without my love are useless now.
37537,BOOK IV.,A thousand blossoms fair to see
37538,BOOK IV.,With passing glory clothe each tree
37539,BOOK IV.,That hangs its cluster-burthened head
37540,BOOK IV.,"Now that the dewy months(528) are fled,"
37541,BOOK IV.,"But, followed by the bees that ply"
37542,BOOK IV.,"Their fragrant task, they fall and die."
37543,BOOK IV.,A thousand birds in wild delight
37544,BOOK IV.,Their rapture-breathing notes unite;
37545,BOOK IV.,"Bird calls to bird in joyous strain,"
37546,BOOK IV.,And turns my love to frenzied pain.
37547,BOOK IV.,"O, if beneath those alien skies,"
37548,BOOK IV.,"There be a spring where Sítá lies,"
37549,BOOK IV.,I know my prisoned love must be
37550,BOOK IV.,"Touched with like grief, and mourn with me."
37551,BOOK IV.,"But ah, methinks that dreary clime"
37552,BOOK IV.,Knows not the touch of spring's sweet time.
37553,BOOK IV.,"How could my black eyed love sustain,"
37554,BOOK IV.,"Without her lord, so dire a pain?"
37555,BOOK IV.,Or if the sweet spring come to her
37556,BOOK IV.,"In distant lands a prisoner,"
37557,BOOK IV.,How may his advent and her met
37558,BOOK IV.,On every side with taunt and threat?
37559,BOOK IV.,"Ah, if the springtide's languor came"
37560,BOOK IV.,"With soft enchantment o'er my dame,"
37561,BOOK IV.,"My darling of the lotus eye,"
37562,BOOK IV.,"My gently speaking love, would die;"
37563,BOOK IV.,For well my spirit knows that she
37564,BOOK IV.,Can never live bereft of me
37565,BOOK IV.,With love that never wavered yet
37566,BOOK IV.,"My Sítá's heart, on me is set,"
37567,BOOK IV.,"Who, with a soul that ne'er can stray,"
37568,BOOK IV.,With equal love her love repay.
37569,BOOK IV.,"In vain, in vain the soft wind brings"
37570,BOOK IV.,Sweet blossoms on his balmy wings;
37571,BOOK IV.,"Delicious from his native snow,"
37572,BOOK IV.,To me like fire he seems to glow.
37573,BOOK IV.,"O, how I loved a breeze like this"
37574,BOOK IV.,When darling Sítá shared the bliss!
37575,BOOK IV.,But now in vain for me it blows
37576,BOOK IV.,To fan the fury of my woes.
37577,BOOK IV.,That dark-winged bird that sought the skies
37578,BOOK IV.,"Foretelling grief with warning cries,"
37579,BOOK IV.,"Sits on the tree where buds are gay,"
37580,BOOK IV.,And pours glad music from the spray.
37581,BOOK IV.,That rover of the fields of air
37582,BOOK IV.,"Will aid my love with friendly care,"
37583,BOOK IV.,And me with gracious pity guide
37584,BOOK IV.,To my large-eyed Videhan's side.(529)
37585,BOOK IV.,"Hark, Lakshman, how the woods around"
37586,BOOK IV.,"With love-inspiring chants resound,"
37587,BOOK IV.,Where birds in every bloom-crowned tree
37588,BOOK IV.,Pour forth their amorous minstrelsy.
37589,BOOK IV.,As though an eager gallant wooed
37590,BOOK IV.,"A gentle maid by love subdued,"
37591,BOOK IV.,Enamoured of her flowers the bee
37592,BOOK IV.,Darts at the wind-rocked Tila tree.(530)
37593,BOOK IV.,"Asoka, brightest tree that grows,"
37594,BOOK IV.,"That lends a pang to lovers' woes,"
37595,BOOK IV.,Hangs out his gorgeous bloom in scorn
37596,BOOK IV.,And mocks me as I weep forlorn.
37597,BOOK IV.,"O Lakshman, turn thine eye and see"
37598,BOOK IV.,"Each blossom-laden Mango tree,"
37599,BOOK IV.,Like a young lover gaily dressed
37600,BOOK IV.,Whom fond desire forbids to rest.
37601,BOOK IV.,"Look, son of Queen Sumitrá through"
37602,BOOK IV.,"The forest glades of varied hue,"
37603,BOOK IV.,Where blooms are bright and grass is green
37604,BOOK IV.,The Kinnars(531) with their loves are seen.
37605,BOOK IV.,"See, brother, see where sweet and bright"
37606,BOOK IV.,"Those crimson lilies charm the sight,"
37607,BOOK IV.,And o'er the flood a radiance throw
37608,BOOK IV.,Fair as the morning's roseate glow.
37609,BOOK IV.,"See, Pampá, most divinely sweet,"
37610,BOOK IV.,"The swan's and mallard's loved retreat,"
37611,BOOK IV.,"Shows her glad waters bright and clear,"
37612,BOOK IV.,Where lotuses their heads uprear
37613,BOOK IV.,"From the pure wave, and charm the view"
37614,BOOK IV.,With mingled tints of red and blue.
37615,BOOK IV.,Each like the morning's early beams
37616,BOOK IV.,Reflected in the crystal gleams;
37617,BOOK IV.,And bees on their sweet toil intent
37618,BOOK IV.,Weigh down each tender filament.
37619,BOOK IV.,There with gay lawns the wood recedes;
37620,BOOK IV.,"There wildfowl sport amid the reeds,"
37621,BOOK IV.,"There roedeer stand upon the brink,"
37622,BOOK IV.,And elephants descend to drink.
37623,BOOK IV.,The rippling waves which winds make fleet
37624,BOOK IV.,"Against the bending lilies beat,"
37625,BOOK IV.,And opening bud and flower and stem
37626,BOOK IV.,Gleam with the drops that hang on them.
37627,BOOK IV.,Life has no pleasure left for me
37628,BOOK IV.,"While my dear queen I may not see,"
37629,BOOK IV.,Who loved so well those blooms that vie
37630,BOOK IV.,With the full splendour of her eye.
37631,BOOK IV.,"O tyrant Love, who will not let"
37632,BOOK IV.,My bosom for one hour forget
37633,BOOK IV.,"The lost one whom I yearn to meet,"
37634,BOOK IV.,Whose words were ever kind and sweet.
37635,BOOK IV.,"Ah, haply might my heart endure"
37636,BOOK IV.,"This hopeless love that knows not cure,"
37637,BOOK IV.,If spring with all his trees in flower
37638,BOOK IV.,Assailed me not with ruthless power.
37639,BOOK IV.,"Each lovely scene, each sound and sight"
37640,BOOK IV.,"Wherein, with her, I found delight,"
37641,BOOK IV.,"Has lost the charm so sweet of yore,"
37642,BOOK IV.,And glads my widowed heart no more.
37643,BOOK IV.,"On lotus buds I seem to gaze,"
37644,BOOK IV.,Or blooms that deck Palása(532) sprays;(533)
37645,BOOK IV.,
37646,BOOK IV.,But to my tortured memory rise
37647,BOOK IV.,The glories of my darling's eyes.
37648,BOOK IV.,Cool breezes through the forest stray
37649,BOOK IV.,"Gathering odours on their way,"
37650,BOOK IV.,Enriched with all the rifled scent
37651,BOOK IV.,Of lotus flower and filament.
37652,BOOK IV.,Their touch upon my temples falls
37653,BOOK IV.,And Sítá's fragrant breath recalls.
37654,BOOK IV.,"Now look, dear brother, on the right"
37655,BOOK IV.,Of Pampá towers a mountain height
37656,BOOK IV.,Where fairest Cassia trees unfold
37657,BOOK IV.,The treasures of their burnished gold.
37658,BOOK IV.,Proud mountain king! his woody side
37659,BOOK IV.,"With myriad ores is decked and dyed,"
37660,BOOK IV.,And as the wind-swept blossoms fall
37661,BOOK IV.,Their fragrant dust is stained with all.
37662,BOOK IV.,To yon high lands thy glances turn:
37663,BOOK IV.,"With pendent fire they flash and burn,"
37664,BOOK IV.,Where in their vernal glory blaze
37665,BOOK IV.,Palása flowers on leafless sprays.
37666,BOOK IV.,"O Lakshman, look! on Pampá's side"
37667,BOOK IV.,What fair trees rise in blooming pride!
37668,BOOK IV.,What climbing plants above them show
37669,BOOK IV.,Or hang their flowery garlands low!
37670,BOOK IV.,See how the amorous creeper rings
37671,BOOK IV.,"The wind-rocked trees to which she clings,"
37672,BOOK IV.,As though a dame by love impelled
37673,BOOK IV.,With clasping arms her lover held.
37674,BOOK IV.,Drunk with the varied scents that fill
37675,BOOK IV.,"The balmy air, from hill to hill,"
37676,BOOK IV.,"From grove to grove, from tree to tree,"
37677,BOOK IV.,The joyous wind is wandering free.
37678,BOOK IV.,These gay trees wave their branches bent
37679,BOOK IV.,"By blooms, of honey redolent."
37680,BOOK IV.,"There, slowly opening to the day,"
37681,BOOK IV.,Buds with dark lustre deck the spray.
37682,BOOK IV.,The wild bee rests a moment where
37683,BOOK IV.,"Each tempting flower is sweet and fair,"
37684,BOOK IV.,"Then, coloured by the pollen dyes,"
37685,BOOK IV.,Deep in some odorous blossom lies.
37686,BOOK IV.,Soon from his couch away he springs:
37687,BOOK IV.,"To other trees his course he wings,"
37688,BOOK IV.,And tastes the honeyed blooms that grow
37689,BOOK IV.,Where Pampá's lucid waters flow.
37690,BOOK IV.,"See, Lakshman, see, how thickly spread"
37691,BOOK IV.,"With blossoms from the trees o'erhead,"
37692,BOOK IV.,That grass the weary traveller woos
37693,BOOK IV.,"With couches of a thousand hues,"
37694,BOOK IV.,And beds on every height arrayed
37695,BOOK IV.,"With red and yellow tints are laid,"
37696,BOOK IV.,No longer winter chills the earth:
37697,BOOK IV.,"A thousand flowerets spring to birth,"
37698,BOOK IV.,And trees in rivalry assume
37699,BOOK IV.,Their vernal garb of bud and bloom.
37700,BOOK IV.,"How fair they look, how bright and gay"
37701,BOOK IV.,With tasselled flowers on every spray!
37702,BOOK IV.,While each to each proud challenge flings
37703,BOOK IV.,Borne in the song the wild bee sings.
37704,BOOK IV.,That mallard by the river edge
37705,BOOK IV.,Has bathed amid the reeds and sedge:
37706,BOOK IV.,Now with his mate he fondly plays
37707,BOOK IV.,And fires my bosom as I gaze.
37708,BOOK IV.,
37709,BOOK IV.,Mandákiní(534) is far renowned:
37710,BOOK IV.,No lovelier flood on earth is found;
37711,BOOK IV.,But all her fairest charms combined
37712,BOOK IV.,In this sweet stream enchant the mind.
37713,BOOK IV.,"O, if my love were here to look"
37714,BOOK IV.,"With me upon this lovely brook,"
37715,BOOK IV.,"Never for Ayodhyá would I pine,"
37716,BOOK IV.,Or wish that Indra's lot were mine.
37717,BOOK IV.,If by my darling's side I strayed
37718,BOOK IV.,"O'er the soft turf which decks the glade,"
37719,BOOK IV.,"Each craving thought were sweetly stilled,"
37720,BOOK IV.,Each longing of my soul fulfilled.
37721,BOOK IV.,"But, now my love is far away,"
37722,BOOK IV.,"Those trees which make the woods so gay,"
37723,BOOK IV.,"In all their varied beauty dressed,"
37724,BOOK IV.,Wake thoughts of anguish in my breast.
37725,BOOK IV.,
37726,BOOK IV.,That lotus-covered stream behold
37727,BOOK IV.,"Whose waters run so fresh and cold,"
37728,BOOK IV.,"Sweet rill, the wildfowl's loved resort,"
37729,BOOK IV.,"Where curlew, swan, and diver sport;"
37730,BOOK IV.,"Where with his consort plays the drake,"
37731,BOOK IV.,"And tall deer love their thirst to slake,"
37732,BOOK IV.,While from each woody bank is heard
37733,BOOK IV.,The wild note of each happy bird.
37734,BOOK IV.,The music of that joyous quire
37735,BOOK IV.,Fills all my soul with soft desire;
37736,BOOK IV.,"And, as I hear, my sad thoughts fly"
37737,BOOK IV.,"To Sítá of the lotus eye,"
37738,BOOK IV.,"Whom, lovely with her moonbright cheek,"
37739,BOOK IV.,In vain mine eager glances seek.
37740,BOOK IV.,"Now turn, those chequered lawns survey"
37741,BOOK IV.,Where hart and hind together stray.
37742,BOOK IV.,"Ah, as they wander at their will"
37743,BOOK IV.,"My troubled breast with grief they fill,"
37744,BOOK IV.,While torn by hopeless love I sigh
37745,BOOK IV.,For Sítá of the fawn-like eye.
37746,BOOK IV.,"If in those glades where, touched by spring,"
37747,BOOK IV.,"Gay birds their amorous ditties sing,"
37748,BOOK IV.,"Mine own beloved I might see,"
37749,BOOK IV.,"Then, brother, it were well with me:"
37750,BOOK IV.,"If by my side she wandered still,"
37751,BOOK IV.,And this cool breeze that stirs the rill
37752,BOOK IV.,Touched with its gentle breath the brows
37753,BOOK IV.,Of mine own dear Videhan spouse.
37754,BOOK IV.,"For, Lakshman, O how blest are those"
37755,BOOK IV.,"On whom the breath of Pampá blows,"
37756,BOOK IV.,Dispelling all their care and gloom
37757,BOOK IV.,With sweets from where the lilies bloom!
37758,BOOK IV.,How can my gentle love remain
37759,BOOK IV.,"Alive amid the woe and pain,"
37760,BOOK IV.,"Where prisoned far away she lies,--"
37761,BOOK IV.,My darling of the lotus eyes?
37762,BOOK IV.,How shall I dare her sire to greet
37763,BOOK IV.,Whose lips have never known deceit?
37764,BOOK IV.,How stand before the childless king
37765,BOOK IV.,And meet his eager questioning?
37766,BOOK IV.,"When banished by my sire's decree,"
37767,BOOK IV.,"In low estate, she followed me."
37768,BOOK IV.,"So pure, so true to every vow,"
37769,BOOK IV.,Where is my gentle darling now?
37770,BOOK IV.,"How can I bear my widowed lot,"
37771,BOOK IV.,"And linger on where she is not,"
37772,BOOK IV.,Who followed when from home I fled
37773,BOOK IV.,"Distracted, disinherited?"
37774,BOOK IV.,My spirit sinks in hopeless pain
37775,BOOK IV.,When my fond glances yearn in vain
37776,BOOK IV.,For that dear face with whose bright eye
37777,BOOK IV.,The worshipped lotus scarce can vie.
37778,BOOK IV.,"Ah when, my brother, shall I hear"
37779,BOOK IV.,"That voice that rang so soft and clear,"
37780,BOOK IV.,"When, sweetly smiling as she spoke,"
37781,BOOK IV.,From her dear lips gay laughter broke?
37782,BOOK IV.,When worn with toil and love I strayed
37783,BOOK IV.,"With Sítá through the forest shade,"
37784,BOOK IV.,"No trace of grief was seen in her,"
37785,BOOK IV.,My kind and thoughtful comforter.
37786,BOOK IV.,How shall my faltering tongue relate
37787,BOOK IV.,To Queen Kausalyá Sítá's fate?
37788,BOOK IV.,How answer when in wild despair
37789,BOOK IV.,"She questions, Where is Sítá, where?"
37790,BOOK IV.,"Haste, brother, haste: to Bharat hie,"
37791,BOOK IV.,On whose fond love I still rely.
37792,BOOK IV.,"My life can be no longer borne,"
37793,BOOK IV.,"Since Sítá from my side is torn."""
37794,BOOK IV.,
37795,BOOK IV.,"Thus like a helpless mourner, bent"
37796,BOOK IV.,"By sorrow, Ráma made lament;"
37797,BOOK IV.,And with wise counsel Lakshman tried
37798,BOOK IV.,"To soothe his care, and thus replied:"
37799,BOOK IV.,"""O best of men, thy grief oppose,"
37800,BOOK IV.,Nor sink beneath thy weight of woes.
37801,BOOK IV.,Not thus despond the great and pure
37802,BOOK IV.,"And brave like thee, but still endure."
37803,BOOK IV.,Reflect what anguish wrings the heart
37804,BOOK IV.,When loving souls are forced to part;
37805,BOOK IV.,"And, mindful of the coming pain,"
37806,BOOK IV.,Thy love within thy breast restrain.
37807,BOOK IV.,"For earth, though cooled by wandering streams,"
37808,BOOK IV.,Lies scorched beneath the midday beams.
37809,BOOK IV.,"Rávan his steps to hell may bend,"
37810,BOOK IV.,Or lower yet in flight descend;
37811,BOOK IV.,"But be thou sure, O Raghu's son,"
37812,BOOK IV.,Avenging death he shall not shun.
37813,BOOK IV.,"Rise, Ráma, rise: the search begin,"
37814,BOOK IV.,And track the giant foul with sin.
37815,BOOK IV.,"Then shall the fiend, though far he fly,"
37816,BOOK IV.,Resign his prey or surely die.
37817,BOOK IV.,"Yea, though the trembling monster hide"
37818,BOOK IV.,"With Sítá close to Diti's(535) side,"
37819,BOOK IV.,"E'en there, unless he yield the prize,"
37820,BOOK IV.,Slain by this wrathful hand he dies.
37821,BOOK IV.,"Thy heart with strength and courage stay,"
37822,BOOK IV.,And cast this weakling mood away.
37823,BOOK IV.,Our fainting hopes in vain revive
37824,BOOK IV.,Unless with firm resolve we strive.
37825,BOOK IV.,The zeal that fires the toiler's breast
37826,BOOK IV.,Mid earthly powers is first and best.
37827,BOOK IV.,"Zeal every check and bar defies,"
37828,BOOK IV.,"And wins at length the loftiest prize,"
37829,BOOK IV.,"In woe and danger, toil and care,"
37830,BOOK IV.,Zeal never yields to weak despair.
37831,BOOK IV.,"With zealous heart thy task begin,"
37832,BOOK IV.,And thou once more thy spouse shalt win.
37833,BOOK IV.,"Cast fruitless sorrow from thy soul,"
37834,BOOK IV.,Nor let this love thy heart control.
37835,BOOK IV.,"Forget not all thy sacred lore,"
37836,BOOK IV.,"But be thy noble self once more."""
37837,BOOK IV.,
37838,BOOK IV.,"He heard, his bosom rent by grief,"
37839,BOOK IV.,The counsel of his brother chief;
37840,BOOK IV.,"Crushed in his heart the maddening pain,"
37841,BOOK IV.,And rose resolved and strong again.
37842,BOOK IV.,Then forth upon his journey went
37843,BOOK IV.,"The hero on his task intent,"
37844,BOOK IV.,"Nor thought of Pampá's lovely brook,"
37845,BOOK IV.,"Or trees which murmuring breezes shook,"
37846,BOOK IV.,"Though on dark woods his glances fell,"
37847,BOOK IV.,On waterfall and cave and dell;
37848,BOOK IV.,And still by many a care distressed
37849,BOOK IV.,The son of Raghu onward pressed.
37850,BOOK IV.,As some wild elephant elate
37851,BOOK IV.,"Moves through the woods in pride,"
37852,BOOK IV.,So Lakshman with majestic gait
37853,BOOK IV.,Strode by his brother's side.
37854,BOOK IV.,"He, for his lofty spirit famed,"
37855,BOOK IV.,Admonished and consoled;
37856,BOOK IV.,"Showed Raghu's son what duty claimed,"
37857,BOOK IV.,And bade his heart be bold.
37858,BOOK IV.,Then as the brothers strode apace
37859,BOOK IV.,"To Rishyamúka's height,"
37860,BOOK IV.,The sovereign of the Vánar race(536)
37861,BOOK IV.,Was troubled at the sight.
37862,BOOK IV.,As on the lofty hill he strayed
37863,BOOK IV.,He saw the chiefs draw near:
37864,BOOK IV.,"A while their glorious forms surveyed,"
37865,BOOK IV.,And mused in restless fear.
37866,BOOK IV.,His slow majestic step he stayed
37867,BOOK IV.,And gazed upon the pair.
37868,BOOK IV.,And all his spirit sank dismayed
37869,BOOK IV.,By fear too great to bear.
37870,BOOK IV.,When in their glorious might the best
37871,BOOK IV.,"Of royal chiefs came nigh,"
37872,BOOK IV.,The Vánars in their wild unrest
37873,BOOK IV.,Prepared to turn and fly.
37874,BOOK IV.,They sought the hermit's sacred home(537)
37875,BOOK IV.,"For peace and bliss ordained,"
37876,BOOK IV.,"And there, where Vánars loved to roam,"
37877,BOOK IV.,A sure asylum gained.
37878,BOOK IV.,
37879,BOOK IV.,
37880,BOOK IV.,
37881,BOOK IV.,
37882,BOOK IV.,Canto II. Sugríva's Alarm.
37883,BOOK IV.,
37884,BOOK IV.,
37885,BOOK IV.,Sugríva moved by wondering awe
37886,BOOK IV.,"The high-souled sons of Raghu saw,"
37887,BOOK IV.,In all their glorious arms arrayed;
37888,BOOK IV.,And grief upon his spirit weighed.
37889,BOOK IV.,To every quarter of the sky
37890,BOOK IV.,"He turned in fear his anxious eye,"
37891,BOOK IV.,And roving still from spot to spot
37892,BOOK IV.,With troubled steps he rested not.
37893,BOOK IV.,"He durst not, as he viewed the pair,"
37894,BOOK IV.,Resolve to stand and meet them there;
37895,BOOK IV.,And drooping cheer and quailing breast
37896,BOOK IV.,The terror of the chief confessed.
37897,BOOK IV.,"While the great fear his bosom shook,"
37898,BOOK IV.,Brief counsel with his lords he took;
37899,BOOK IV.,"Each gain and danger closely scanned,"
37900,BOOK IV.,"What hope in flight, what power to stand,"
37901,BOOK IV.,"While doubt and fear his bosom rent,"
37902,BOOK IV.,"On Raghu's sons his eyes he bent,"
37903,BOOK IV.,And with a spirit ill at ease
37904,BOOK IV.,Addressed his lords in words like these:
37905,BOOK IV.,
37906,BOOK IV.,"""Those chiefs with wandering steps invade"
37907,BOOK IV.,"The shelter of our pathless shade,"
37908,BOOK IV.,And hither come in fair disguise
37909,BOOK IV.,"Of hermit garb as Báli's spies."""
37910,BOOK IV.,
37911,BOOK IV.,Each lord beheld with troubled heart
37912,BOOK IV.,"Those masters of the bowman's art,"
37913,BOOK IV.,And left the mountain side to seek
37914,BOOK IV.,Sure refuge on a loftier peak.
37915,BOOK IV.,The Vánar chief in rapid flight
37916,BOOK IV.,"Found shelter on a towering height,"
37917,BOOK IV.,And all the band with one accord
37918,BOOK IV.,Were closely gathered round their lord.
37919,BOOK IV.,"Their course the same, with desperate leap"
37920,BOOK IV.,"Each made his way from steep to steep,"
37921,BOOK IV.,And speeding on in wild career
37922,BOOK IV.,Filled every height with sudden fear.
37923,BOOK IV.,"Each heart was struck with mortal dread,"
37924,BOOK IV.,"As on their course the Vánars sped,"
37925,BOOK IV.,While trees that crowned the steep were bent
37926,BOOK IV.,And crushed beneath them as they went.
37927,BOOK IV.,As in their eager flight they pressed
37928,BOOK IV.,"For safety to each mountain crest,"
37929,BOOK IV.,The wild confusion struck with fear
37930,BOOK IV.,Tiger and cat and wandering deer.
37931,BOOK IV.,The lords who watched Sugríva's will
37932,BOOK IV.,"Were gathered on the royal hill,"
37933,BOOK IV.,And all with reverent hands upraised
37934,BOOK IV.,Upon their king and leader gazed.
37935,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva feared some evil planned,"
37936,BOOK IV.,Some train prepared by Báli's hand.
37937,BOOK IV.,"But, skilled in words that charm and teach,"
37938,BOOK IV.,Thus Hanumán(538) began his speech:
37939,BOOK IV.,
37940,BOOK IV.,"""Dismiss, dismiss thine idle fear,"
37941,BOOK IV.,Nor dread the power of Báli here.
37942,BOOK IV.,For this is Malaya's glorious hill(539)
37943,BOOK IV.,Where Báli's might can work no ill.
37944,BOOK IV.,I look around but nowhere see
37945,BOOK IV.,"The hated foe who made thee flee,"
37946,BOOK IV.,"Fell Báli, fierce in form and face:"
37947,BOOK IV.,"Then fear not, lord of Vánar race."
37948,BOOK IV.,"Alas, in thee I clearly find"
37949,BOOK IV.,"The weakness of the Vánar kind,"
37950,BOOK IV.,"That loves from thought to thought to range,"
37951,BOOK IV.,Fix no belief and welcome change.
37952,BOOK IV.,"Mark well each hint and sign and scan,"
37953,BOOK IV.,"Discreet and wise, thine every plan."
37954,BOOK IV.,"How may a king, with sense denied,"
37955,BOOK IV.,"The subjects of his sceptre guide?"""
37956,BOOK IV.,
37957,BOOK IV.,"Hanúmán,(540) wise in hour of need,"
37958,BOOK IV.,Urged on the chief his prudent rede.
37959,BOOK IV.,"His listening ear Sugríva bent,"
37960,BOOK IV.,And spake in words more excellent:
37961,BOOK IV.,
37962,BOOK IV.,"""Where is the dauntless heart that free"
37963,BOOK IV.,From terror's chilling touch can see
37964,BOOK IV.,"Two stranger warriors, strong as those,"
37965,BOOK IV.,"Equipped with swords and shafts and bows,"
37966,BOOK IV.,"With mighty arms and large full eyes,"
37967,BOOK IV.,Like glorious children of the skies?
37968,BOOK IV.,"Báli my foe, I ween, has sent"
37969,BOOK IV.,These chiefs to aid his dark intent.
37970,BOOK IV.,"Hence doubt and fear disturb me still,"
37971,BOOK IV.,"For thousands serve a monarch's will,"
37972,BOOK IV.,"In borrowed garb they come, and those"
37973,BOOK IV.,Who walk disguised are counted foes.
37974,BOOK IV.,"With secret thoughts they watch their time,"
37975,BOOK IV.,And wound fond hearts that fear no crime.
37976,BOOK IV.,"My foe in state affairs is wise,"
37977,BOOK IV.,And prudent kings have searching eyes.
37978,BOOK IV.,By other hands they strike the foe:
37979,BOOK IV.,By meaner tools the truth they know.
37980,BOOK IV.,"Now to those stranger warriors turn,"
37981,BOOK IV.,"And, less than king, their purpose learn."
37982,BOOK IV.,Mark well the trick and look of each;
37983,BOOK IV.,Observe his form and note his speech.
37984,BOOK IV.,"With care their mood and temper sound,"
37985,BOOK IV.,"And, if their minds be friendly found,"
37986,BOOK IV.,With courteous looks and words begin
37987,BOOK IV.,Their confidence and love to win.
37988,BOOK IV.,"Then as my friend and envoy speak,"
37989,BOOK IV.,And question what the strangers seek.
37990,BOOK IV.,Ask why equipped with shaft and bow
37991,BOOK IV.,Through this wild maze of wood they go.
37992,BOOK IV.,"If they, O chief, at first appear"
37993,BOOK IV.,"Pure of all guile, in heart sincere,"
37994,BOOK IV.,Detect in speech and look the sin
37995,BOOK IV.,"And treachery that lurk within."""
37996,BOOK IV.,
37997,BOOK IV.,He spoke: the Wind-God's son obeyed.
37998,BOOK IV.,"With ready zeal he sought the shade,"
37999,BOOK IV.,And reached with hasty steps the wood
38000,BOOK IV.,Where Raghu's son and Lakshman stood.(541)
38001,BOOK IV.,
38002,BOOK IV.,
38003,BOOK IV.,
38004,BOOK IV.,
38005,BOOK IV.,Canto III. Hanumán's Speech.
38006,BOOK IV.,
38007,BOOK IV.,
38008,BOOK IV.,The envoy in his faithful breast
38009,BOOK IV.,Pondered Sugríva's high behest.
38010,BOOK IV.,From Rishyamúka's peak he hied
38011,BOOK IV.,And placed him by the princes' side.
38012,BOOK IV.,The Wind-God's son with cautious art
38013,BOOK IV.,"Had laid his Vánar form apart,"
38014,BOOK IV.,"And wore, to cheat the strangers eyes,"
38015,BOOK IV.,A wandering mendicant's disguise.(542)
38016,BOOK IV.,Before the heroes' feet he bent
38017,BOOK IV.,"And did obeisance reverent,"
38018,BOOK IV.,"And spoke, the glorious pair to praise,"
38019,BOOK IV.,"His words of truth in courteous phrase,"
38020,BOOK IV.,"High honour duly paid, the best"
38021,BOOK IV.,"Of all the Vánar kind addressed,"
38022,BOOK IV.,"With free accord and gentle grace,"
38023,BOOK IV.,Those glories of their warrior race:
38024,BOOK IV.,
38025,BOOK IV.,"""O hermits, blest in vows, who shine"
38026,BOOK IV.,"Like royal saints or Gods divine,"
38027,BOOK IV.,"O best of young ascetics, say"
38028,BOOK IV.,"How to this spot you found your way,"
38029,BOOK IV.,Scaring the troops of wandering deer
38030,BOOK IV.,And silvan things that harbour here
38031,BOOK IV.,Searching amid the trees that grow
38032,BOOK IV.,Where Pampá's gentle waters flow.
38033,BOOK IV.,And lending from your brows a gleam
38034,BOOK IV.,Of glory to the lovely stream.
38035,BOOK IV.,"Who are you, say, so brave and fair,"
38036,BOOK IV.,Clad in the bark which hermits wear?
38037,BOOK IV.,"I see you heave the frequent sigh,"
38038,BOOK IV.,I see the deer before you fly.
38039,BOOK IV.,"While you, for strength and valour dread,"
38040,BOOK IV.,"The earth, like lordly lions, tread,"
38041,BOOK IV.,"Each bearing in his hand a bow,"
38042,BOOK IV.,"Like Indra's own, to slay the foe."
38043,BOOK IV.,"With the grand paces of a bull,"
38044,BOOK IV.,So bright and young and beautiful.
38045,BOOK IV.,The mighty arms you raise appear
38046,BOOK IV.,"Like trunks which elephants uprear,"
38047,BOOK IV.,And as you move this mountain-king(543)
38048,BOOK IV.,Is glorious with the light you bring.
38049,BOOK IV.,"How have you reached, like Gods in face,"
38050,BOOK IV.,"Best lords of earth, this lonely place,"
38051,BOOK IV.,"With tresses coiled in hermit guise,(544)"
38052,BOOK IV.,And splendours of those lotus eyes?
38053,BOOK IV.,"As Gods who leave their heavenly sphere,"
38054,BOOK IV.,Alike your beauteous forms appear.
38055,BOOK IV.,The Lords of Day and Night(545) might thus
38056,BOOK IV.,Stray from the skies to visit us.
38057,BOOK IV.,"Heroic youth, so broad of chest,"
38058,BOOK IV.,"Fair with the beauty of the Blest,"
38059,BOOK IV.,"With lion shoulders, tall and strong,"
38060,BOOK IV.,"Like bulls who lead the lowing throng,"
38061,BOOK IV.,"Your arms, unmatched for grace and length,"
38062,BOOK IV.,With massive clubs may vie in strength.
38063,BOOK IV.,Why do no gauds those limbs adorn
38064,BOOK IV.,Where priceless gems were meetly worn?
38065,BOOK IV.,"Each noble youth is fit, I deem,"
38066,BOOK IV.,"To guard this earth, as lord supreme,"
38067,BOOK IV.,"With all her woods and seas, to reign"
38068,BOOK IV.,From Meru's peak to Vindhya's chain.
38069,BOOK IV.,Your smooth bows decked with dyes and gold
38070,BOOK IV.,"Are glorious in their masters' hold,"
38071,BOOK IV.,And with the arms of Indra(546) vie
38072,BOOK IV.,Which diamond splendours beautify.
38073,BOOK IV.,"Your quivers glow with golden sheen,"
38074,BOOK IV.,"Well stored with arrows fleet and keen,"
38075,BOOK IV.,Each gleaming like a fiery snake
38076,BOOK IV.,That joys the foeman's life to take.
38077,BOOK IV.,As serpents cast their sloughs away
38078,BOOK IV.,"And all their new born sheen display,"
38079,BOOK IV.,So flash your mighty swords inlaid
38080,BOOK IV.,With burning gold on hilt and blade.
38081,BOOK IV.,"Why are you silent, heroes? Why"
38082,BOOK IV.,My questions hear nor deign reply?
38083,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, lord of virtuous mind,"
38084,BOOK IV.,"The foremost of the Vánar kind,"
38085,BOOK IV.,"An exile from his royal state,"
38086,BOOK IV.,Roams through the land disconsolate.
38087,BOOK IV.,"I, Hanumán, of Vánar race,"
38088,BOOK IV.,"Sent by the king have sought this place,"
38089,BOOK IV.,"For he, the pious, just, and true,"

38091,BOOK IV.,"Know, godlike youths, that I am one"
38092,BOOK IV.,"Of his chief lords, the Wind-God's son."
38093,BOOK IV.,"With course unchecked I roam at will,"
38094,BOOK IV.,"And now from Rishyamúka's hill,"
38095,BOOK IV.,"To please his heart, his hope to speed,"
38096,BOOK IV.,"I came disguised in beggar's weed."""
38097,BOOK IV.,
38098,BOOK IV.,"Thus Hanúmán, well trained in lore"
38099,BOOK IV.,"Of language, spoke, and said no more."
38100,BOOK IV.,The son of Raghu joyed to hear
38101,BOOK IV.,"The envoy's speech, and bright of cheer"
38102,BOOK IV.,"He turned to Lakshman by his side,"
38103,BOOK IV.,And thus in words of transport cried:

38105,BOOK IV.,"""The counselor we now behold"

38109,BOOK IV.,With sweetest words in courteous phrase
38110,BOOK IV.,Answer this mighty lord who slays
38111,BOOK IV.,"His foemen, by Sugríva sent,"
38112,BOOK IV.,This Vánar chief most eloquent.
38113,BOOK IV.,For one whose words so sweetly flow
38114,BOOK IV.,"The whole Rig-veda(547) needs must know,"
38115,BOOK IV.,And in his well-trained memory store
38116,BOOK IV.,The Yajush and the Sáman's lore.
38117,BOOK IV.,He must have bent his faithful ear
38118,BOOK IV.,All grammar's varied rules to hear.
38119,BOOK IV.,For his long speech how well he spoke!
38120,BOOK IV.,In all its length no rule he broke.
38121,BOOK IV.,"In eye, on brow, in all his face"
38122,BOOK IV.,The keenest look no guile could trace.
38123,BOOK IV.,"No change of hue, no pose of limb"
38124,BOOK IV.,Gave sign that aught was false in him.
38125,BOOK IV.,"Concise, unfaltering, sweet and clear,"
38126,BOOK IV.,Without a word to pain the ear.
38127,BOOK IV.,"From chest to throat, nor high nor low,"
38128,BOOK IV.,His accents came in measured flow.
38129,BOOK IV.,How well he spoke with perfect art
38130,BOOK IV.,"That wondrous speech that charmed the heart,"
38131,BOOK IV.,With finest skill and order graced
38132,BOOK IV.,In words that knew nor pause nor haste!
38133,BOOK IV.,"That speech, with consonants that spring"
38134,BOOK IV.,"From the three seats of uttering,(548)"
38135,BOOK IV.,Would charm the spirit of a foe
38136,BOOK IV.,Whose sword is raised for mortal blow.
38137,BOOK IV.,How may a ruler's plan succeed

38139,BOOK IV.,"How fail, if one whose mind is stored"
38140,BOOK IV.,With gifts so rare assist his lord?

38142,BOOK IV.,"Of envoy's lips to further each?"""
38143,BOOK IV.,
38144,BOOK IV.,Thus Ráma spoke; and Lakshman taught
38145,BOOK IV.,"In all the art that utters thought,"
38146,BOOK IV.,To King Sugríva's learned spy
38147,BOOK IV.,Thus made his eloquent reply:
38148,BOOK IV.,"""Full well we know the gifts that grace"
38149,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, lord of Vánar race,"
38150,BOOK IV.,And hither turn our wandering feet
38151,BOOK IV.,That we that high-souled king may meet.
38152,BOOK IV.,So now our pleasant task shall be
38153,BOOK IV.,"To do the words he speaks by thee."""
38154,BOOK IV.,
38155,BOOK IV.,"His prudent speech the Vánar heard,"

38353,BOOK IV.,That Raghu's son will condescend
38354,BOOK IV.,To seek the Vánar for his friend.
38355,BOOK IV.,If thou my true ally wouldst be

38363,BOOK IV.,Held to his heart his new ally.
38364,BOOK IV.,"In wanderer's weed disguised no more,"

38366,BOOK IV.,"Then, wood with wood engendering,(554) came"

38368,BOOK IV.,Between the chiefs that fire he placed
38369,BOOK IV.,With wreaths of flowers and worship graced.

38372,BOOK IV.,
38373,BOOK IV.,Thus each to other pledged and bound

38390,BOOK IV.,Still trembling with the sweet surprise
38391,BOOK IV.,"Of the great joy he could not hide,"
38392,BOOK IV.,To Raghu's noblest scion cried:
38393,BOOK IV.,"""O Ráma, racked with woe and fear,"

38399,BOOK IV.,Vext by my brother Báli long
38400,BOOK IV.,My soul has borne the scathe and wrong.
38401,BOOK IV.,"Do thou, whose virtues all revere,"

38426,BOOK IV.,
38427,BOOK IV.,"Thus Ráma spake: Sugríva heard,"
38428,BOOK IV.,And mighty joy his bosom stirred:
38429,BOOK IV.,As thus his champion he addressed:
38430,BOOK IV.,"""Now by thy favour, first and best"
38431,BOOK IV.,"Of heroes, shall thy friend obtain"
38432,BOOK IV.,His realm and darling wife again
38433,BOOK IV.,Recovered from the foe.

38461,BOOK IV.,Where with thy brother Lakshman thou
38462,BOOK IV.,"Hast sojourned, bound by hermit vow;"
38463,BOOK IV.,"Have heard how Sítá, Janak's child,"
38464,BOOK IV.,"Was stolen in the pathless wild,"
38465,BOOK IV.,How by a roving Rákshas she
38466,BOOK IV.,Weeping was reft from him and thee;
38467,BOOK IV.,"How, bent on death, the giant slew"
38468,BOOK IV.,"The vulture king, her guardian true,"
38469,BOOK IV.,And gave thy widowed breast to know
38470,BOOK IV.,A solitary mourner's woe.
38471,BOOK IV.,"But soon, dear Prince, thy heart shall be"
38472,BOOK IV.,From every trace of sorrow free;
38473,BOOK IV.,"For I thy darling will restore,"
38474,BOOK IV.,Lost like the prize of holy lore.(558)
38475,BOOK IV.,"Yea, though in heaven the lady dwell,"
38476,BOOK IV.,"Or prisoned in the depths of hell,"
38477,BOOK IV.,My friendly care her way shall track
38478,BOOK IV.,And bring thy ransomed darling back.
38479,BOOK IV.,"Let this my promise soothe thy care,"
38480,BOOK IV.,Nor doubt the words I truly swear.
38481,BOOK IV.,"Saints, fiends, and dwellers of the skies"
38482,BOOK IV.,"Shall find thy wife a bitter prize,"

38485,BOOK IV.,"No longer, Prince, thy loss deplore:"
38486,BOOK IV.,Thy darling wife will I restore.
38487,BOOK IV.,'Twas she I saw: my heart infers
38488,BOOK IV.,"That shrinking form was doubtless hers,"
38489,BOOK IV.,"Which gaint Rávan, fierce and dread,"
38490,BOOK IV.,Bore swiftly through the clouds o'erhead
38491,BOOK IV.,Still writhing in his strict embrace
38492,BOOK IV.,"Like helpless queen of serpent race,(559)"
38493,BOOK IV.,And from her lips that sad voice came
38494,BOOK IV.,Shrieking thine own and Lakshman's name.
38495,BOOK IV.,High on a hill she saw me stand
38496,BOOK IV.,With comrades twain on either hand.
38497,BOOK IV.,"Her outer robe to earth she threw,"
38498,BOOK IV.,And with it sent her anklets too.
38499,BOOK IV.,"We saw the glittering tokens fall,"

38503,BOOK IV.,
38504,BOOK IV.,He ceased: then Raghu's son replied
38505,BOOK IV.,"To the glad tale, and eager cried:"
38506,BOOK IV.,"""Bring them with all thy speed: delay"
38507,BOOK IV.,"No more, dear friend, but haste away."""
38508,BOOK IV.,
38509,BOOK IV.,Thus Ráma spoke. Sugríva hied
38510,BOOK IV.,"Within the mountain's caverned side,"
38511,BOOK IV.,Impelled by love that stirred each thought
38512,BOOK IV.,"The precious tokens quickly brought,"
38513,BOOK IV.,And said to Raghu's son: Behold
38514,BOOK IV.,This garment and these rings of gold.
38515,BOOK IV.,In Ráma's hand with friendly haste
38516,BOOK IV.,The jewels and the robe he placed.
38517,BOOK IV.,"Then, like the moon by mist assailed,"
38518,BOOK IV.,The tear-dimmed eyes of Ráma failed;
38519,BOOK IV.,"That burst of woe unmanned his frame,"
38520,BOOK IV.,"Woe sprung from passion for his dame,"
38521,BOOK IV.,"And with his manly strength o'erthrown,"

38526,BOOK IV.,As from a furious serpent came.
38527,BOOK IV.,On his dear brother standing nigh
38528,BOOK IV.,He turned at length his piteous eye;
38529,BOOK IV.,"And, while his tears increasing ran,"
38530,BOOK IV.,In bitter wail he thus began:
38531,BOOK IV.,"""Look, brother, and behold once more"
38532,BOOK IV.,"The ornaments and robe she wore,"
38533,BOOK IV.,Dropped while the giant bore away
38534,BOOK IV.,"In cruel arras his struggling prey,"
38535,BOOK IV.,"Dropped in some quiet spot, I ween,"
38536,BOOK IV.,Where the young grass was soft and green;
38537,BOOK IV.,For still untouched by spot or stain
38538,BOOK IV.,"Their former beauty all retain."""
38539,BOOK IV.,
38540,BOOK IV.,"He spoke with many a tear and sigh,"
38541,BOOK IV.,And thus his brother made reply:
38542,BOOK IV.,"""The bracelets thou hast fondly shown,"

38544,BOOK IV.,But by long service taught I greet
38545,BOOK IV.,"The anklets of her honoured feet.""(560)"
38546,BOOK IV.,
38547,BOOK IV.,"Then to Sugríva Ráma, best"
38548,BOOK IV.,"Of Raghu's sons, these words addressed:"
38549,BOOK IV.,
38550,BOOK IV.,"""Say to what quarter of the sky"

38552,BOOK IV.,"Bearing afar my captured wife,"
38553,BOOK IV.,My darling dearer than my life.
38554,BOOK IV.,"Speak, Vánar King, that I may know"

38558,BOOK IV.,He who the Maithil lady stole
38559,BOOK IV.,"And kindled fury in my soul,"
38560,BOOK IV.,Has sought his fate in senseless pride
38561,BOOK IV.,And opened Death's dark portal wide.
38562,BOOK IV.,"Then tell me, Vánar lord, I pray,"

38574,BOOK IV.,The Vánar chief he thus addressed:
38575,BOOK IV.,"And he, while sobs his utterance broke,"
38576,BOOK IV.,Raised up his reverent hands and spoke:
38577,BOOK IV.,
38578,BOOK IV.,"""O Raghu's son, I cannot tell"
38579,BOOK IV.,"Where now that cruel fiend may dwell,"
38580,BOOK IV.,"Declare his power and might, or trace"
38581,BOOK IV.,The author of his cursed race.
38582,BOOK IV.,Still trust the promise that I make
38583,BOOK IV.,And let thy breast no longer ache.
38584,BOOK IV.,"So will I toil, nor toil in vain,"
38585,BOOK IV.,That thou thy consort mayst regain.
38586,BOOK IV.,So will I work with might and skill

38589,BOOK IV.,And Rávan and his legions slay.
38590,BOOK IV.,"Awake, awake! unmanned no more"
38591,BOOK IV.,Recall the strength was thine of yore.
38592,BOOK IV.,Beseems not men like thee to wear
38593,BOOK IV.,A weak heart yielding to despair.
38594,BOOK IV.,"Like troubles, too, mine eyes have seen,"
38595,BOOK IV.,Lamenting for a long-lost queen;
38596,BOOK IV.,"But, by despair unconquered yet,"
38597,BOOK IV.,My strength of mind I ne'er forget.
38598,BOOK IV.,Far more shouldst thou of lofty soul
38599,BOOK IV.,"Thy passion and thy tears control,"
38600,BOOK IV.,"When I, of Vánar's humbler strain,"

38606,BOOK IV.,Up! with thine own brave heart advise:
38607,BOOK IV.,Not thus despond the firm and wise.
38608,BOOK IV.,But he who gives his childish heart
38609,BOOK IV.,"To choose the coward's weakling part,"
38610,BOOK IV.,"Sinks, like a foundered vessel, deep"
38611,BOOK IV.,In waves of woe that o'er him sweep.
38612,BOOK IV.,"See, suppliant hand to hand I lay,"

38624,BOOK IV.,
38625,BOOK IV.,Sugríva thus with gentle art

38630,BOOK IV.,"And Ráma was himself again,"
38631,BOOK IV.,Around the king his arms he threw
38632,BOOK IV.,And thus began his speech anew:
38633,BOOK IV.,
38634,BOOK IV.,"""Whate'er a friend most wise and true,"
38635,BOOK IV.,"Who counsels for the best, should do,"
38636,BOOK IV.,"Whate'er his gentle part should be,"
38637,BOOK IV.,"Has been performed, dear friend, by thee."
38638,BOOK IV.,"Taught by thy counsel, O my lord,"
38639,BOOK IV.,I feel my native strength restored.
38640,BOOK IV.,"A friend like thee is hard to gain,"
38641,BOOK IV.,Most rare in time of grief and pain.
38642,BOOK IV.,Now strain thine utmost power to trace
38643,BOOK IV.,"The Maithil lady's dwelling place,"
38644,BOOK IV.,And aid me in my search to find
38645,BOOK IV.,Fierce Rávan of the impious mind.
38646,BOOK IV.,"Trust thou, in turn, thy loyal friend,"
38647,BOOK IV.,And say what aid this arm can lend
38648,BOOK IV.,"To speed thy hopes, as fostering rain"
38649,BOOK IV.,Quickens in earth the scattered grain.
38650,BOOK IV.,"Deem not those words, that seemed to spring"
38651,BOOK IV.,"From pride, are false, O Vánar King."
38652,BOOK IV.,"None from these lips has ever heard,"
38653,BOOK IV.,"None e'er shall hear, one lying word."
38654,BOOK IV.,"Again I promise and declare,"
38655,BOOK IV.,"Yea, by my truth, dear friend, I swear."""
38656,BOOK IV.,
38657,BOOK IV.,"Then glad was King Sugríva's breast,"

38671,BOOK IV.,"Each views me with a favouring eye,"
38672,BOOK IV.,"When thou, whom all good gifts attend,"

38675,BOOK IV.,My arm might win the conquered skies;
38676,BOOK IV.,And shall our banded strength be weak
38677,BOOK IV.,To gain the realm which now I seek?
38678,BOOK IV.,A happy fate was mine above
38679,BOOK IV.,"My kith and kin and all I love,"
38680,BOOK IV.,"When, near the witness fire, I won"
38681,BOOK IV.,"Thy friendship, Raghu's glorious son."
38682,BOOK IV.,Thou too in ripening time shall see
38683,BOOK IV.,Thy friend not all unworthy thee.
38684,BOOK IV.,What gifts I have shall thus be shown:
38685,BOOK IV.,Not mine the tongue to make them known.
38686,BOOK IV.,Strong is the changeless bond that binds
38687,BOOK IV.,"The friendly faith of noble minds,"
38688,BOOK IV.,"In woe, in danger, firm and sure"
38689,BOOK IV.,Their constancy and love endure.
38690,BOOK IV.,"Gold, silver, jewels rich and rare"
38691,BOOK IV.,They count as wealth for friends to share.
38692,BOOK IV.,"Yea, be they rich or poor and low,"

38698,BOOK IV.,
38699,BOOK IV.,"He spoke by generous impulse moved,"
38700,BOOK IV.,And Raghu's son his speech approved
38701,BOOK IV.,"Glancing at Lakshman by his side,"
38702,BOOK IV.,Like Indra in his beauty's pride.
38703,BOOK IV.,The Vánar monarch saw the pair
38704,BOOK IV.,"Of mighty brothers standing there,"
38705,BOOK IV.,And turned his rapid eye to view
38706,BOOK IV.,The forest trees that near him grew.
38707,BOOK IV.,"He saw, not far from where he stood,"
38708,BOOK IV.,A Sál tree towering o'er the wood.
38709,BOOK IV.,Amid the thick leaves many a bee
38710,BOOK IV.,"Graced the scant blossoms of the tree,"
38711,BOOK IV.,"From whose dark shade a bough, that bore"
38712,BOOK IV.,"A load of leafy twigs, he tore,"
38713,BOOK IV.,Which on the grassy ground he laid
38714,BOOK IV.,And seats for him and Ráma made.
38715,BOOK IV.,"Hanúmán saw them sit, he sought"
38716,BOOK IV.,A Sál tree's leafy bough and brought
38717,BOOK IV.,"The burthen, and with meek request"
38718,BOOK IV.,"Entreated Lakshman, too, to rest."
38719,BOOK IV.,"There on the noble mountain's brow,"
38720,BOOK IV.,"Strewn with the young leaves of the bough,"
38721,BOOK IV.,Sat Raghu's son in placid ease
38722,BOOK IV.,Calm as the sea when sleeps the breeze.
38723,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva's heart with rapture swelled,"
38724,BOOK IV.,"And thus, by eager love impelled,"
38725,BOOK IV.,"He spoke in gracious tone, that, oft"
38726,BOOK IV.,"Checked by his joy, was low and soft:"
38727,BOOK IV.,"""I, by my brother's might oppressed,"
38728,BOOK IV.,"By ceaseless woe and fear distressed,"
38729,BOOK IV.,"Mourning my consort far away,"
38730,BOOK IV.,On Rishyamúka's mountain stray.
38731,BOOK IV.,Expelled by Báli's cruel hate
38732,BOOK IV.,I wander here disconsolate.
38733,BOOK IV.,"Do thou to whom all sufferers flee,"
38734,BOOK IV.,"From his dread hand deliver me."""
38735,BOOK IV.,
38736,BOOK IV.,"He spoke, and Ráma, just and brave,"
38737,BOOK IV.,"Whose pious soul to virtue clave,"
38738,BOOK IV.,Smiled as in conscious might he eyed
38739,BOOK IV.,"The king of Vánars, and replied:"
38740,BOOK IV.,"""Best fruit of friendship is the deed"
38741,BOOK IV.,That helps the friend in hour of need;
38742,BOOK IV.,And this mine arm in death shall lay
38743,BOOK IV.,Thy robber ere the close of day.
38744,BOOK IV.,"For see, these feathered darts of mine"
38745,BOOK IV.,"Whose points so fiercely flash and shine,"
38746,BOOK IV.,"And shafts with golden emblem, came"
38747,BOOK IV.,"From dark woods known by Skanda's name,(561)"
38748,BOOK IV.,Winged from the pinion of the hern
38749,BOOK IV.,Like Indra's bolts they strike and burn.
38750,BOOK IV.,With even knots and piercing head
38751,BOOK IV.,Each like a furious snake is sped;
38752,BOOK IV.,"With these, to-day, before thine eye"
38753,BOOK IV.,"Shall, like a shattered mountain, lie"
38754,BOOK IV.,"Báli, thy dread and wicked foe,"
38755,BOOK IV.,"O'erwhelmed in hideous overthrow."""
38756,BOOK IV.,
38757,BOOK IV.,He spoke: Sugríva's bosom swelled
38758,BOOK IV.,With hope and joy unparalleled.
38759,BOOK IV.,"Then his glad voice the Vánar raised,"
38760,BOOK IV.,And thus the son of Raghu praised:
38761,BOOK IV.,"""Long have I pined in depth of grief;"
38762,BOOK IV.,"Thou art the hope of all, O chief."
38763,BOOK IV.,"Now, Raghu's son, I hail thee friend,"
38764,BOOK IV.,And bid thee to my woes attend;
38765,BOOK IV.,"For, by my truth I swear it, now"
38766,BOOK IV.,"Not life itself is dear as thou,"
38767,BOOK IV.,Since by the witness fire we met
38768,BOOK IV.,And friendly hand in hand was set.
38769,BOOK IV.,"Friend communes now with friend, and hence"
38770,BOOK IV.,"I tell with surest confidence,"
38771,BOOK IV.,How woes that on my spirit weigh
38772,BOOK IV.,"Consume me through the night and day."""
38773,BOOK IV.,
38774,BOOK IV.,"For sobs and sighs he scarce could speak,"
38775,BOOK IV.,"And his sad voice came low and weak,"
38776,BOOK IV.,"As, while his eyes with tears o'erflowed,"
38777,BOOK IV.,The burden of his soul he showed.
38778,BOOK IV.,"Then by strong effort, bravely made,"
38779,BOOK IV.,"The torrent of his tears he stayed,"
38780,BOOK IV.,"Wiped his bright eyes, his grief subdued,"
38781,BOOK IV.,"And thus, more calm, his speech renewed:"
38782,BOOK IV.,
38783,BOOK IV.,"""By Báli's conquering might oppressed,"
38784,BOOK IV.,"Of power and kingship dispossessed,"
38785,BOOK IV.,Loaded with taunts of scorn and hate
38786,BOOK IV.,I left my realm and royal state.
38787,BOOK IV.,He tore away my consort: she
38788,BOOK IV.,"Was dearer than my life to me,"
38789,BOOK IV.,And many a friend to me and mine
38790,BOOK IV.,In hopeless chains was doomed to pine.
38791,BOOK IV.,"With wicked thoughts, unsated still,"
38792,BOOK IV.,Me whom he wrongs he yearns to kill;
38793,BOOK IV.,"And spies of Vánar race, who tried"
38794,BOOK IV.,"To slay me, by this hand have died."
38795,BOOK IV.,Moved by this constant doubt and fear
38796,BOOK IV.,"I saw thee, Prince, and came not near."
38797,BOOK IV.,When woe and peril gather round
38798,BOOK IV.,A foe in every form is found.
38799,BOOK IV.,"Save Hanumán, O Raghu's son,"
38800,BOOK IV.,"And these, no friend is left me, none."
38801,BOOK IV.,"Through their kind aid, a faithful band"
38802,BOOK IV.,"Who guard their lord from hostile hand,"
38803,BOOK IV.,Rest when their chieftain rests and bend
38804,BOOK IV.,"Their steps where'er he lists to wend,--"
38805,BOOK IV.,"Through them alone, in toil and pain,"
38806,BOOK IV.,My wretched life I still sustain.
38807,BOOK IV.,"Enough, for thou hast heard in brief"
38808,BOOK IV.,The story of my pain and grief.
38809,BOOK IV.,"His mighty strength all regions know,"
38810,BOOK IV.,"My brother, but my deadly foe."
38811,BOOK IV.,"Ah, if the proud oppressor fell,"
38812,BOOK IV.,His death would all my woe dispel.
38813,BOOK IV.,"Yea, on my cruel conqueror's fall"
38814,BOOK IV.,"My joy depends, my life, my all."
38815,BOOK IV.,"This were the end and sure relief,"
38816,BOOK IV.,"O Ráma, of my tale of grief."
38817,BOOK IV.,"Fair be his lot or dark with woe,"
38818,BOOK IV.,"No comfort like a friend I know."""
38819,BOOK IV.,
38820,BOOK IV.,"Then Ráma spoke: ""O friend, relate"
38821,BOOK IV.,"Whence sprang fraternal strife and hate,"
38822,BOOK IV.,"That duly taught by thee, I may"
38823,BOOK IV.,Each foeman's strength and weakness weigh:
38824,BOOK IV.,And skilled in every chance restore
38825,BOOK IV.,The blissful state thou hadst before.
38826,BOOK IV.,"For, when I think of all the scorn"
38827,BOOK IV.,"And bitter woe thou long hast borne,"
38828,BOOK IV.,My soul indignant swells with pain
38829,BOOK IV.,Like waters flushed with furious rain.
38830,BOOK IV.,"Then, ere I string this bended bow,"
38831,BOOK IV.,"Tell me the tale I long to know,"
38832,BOOK IV.,"Ere from the cord my arrow fly,"
38833,BOOK IV.,"And low in death thy foeman lie."""
38834,BOOK IV.,
38835,BOOK IV.,"He spoke: Sugríva joyed to hear,"
38836,BOOK IV.,Nor less his lords were glad of cheer:
38837,BOOK IV.,And thus to Ráma mighty-souled
38838,BOOK IV.,The cause that moved their strife he told:

38848,BOOK IV.,"My father's eldest-born was he,"
38849,BOOK IV.,Well honoured by his sire and me.
38850,BOOK IV.,"My father died, and each sage lord"
38851,BOOK IV.,Named Báli king with one accord;
38852,BOOK IV.,"And he, by right of birth ordained,"
38853,BOOK IV.,The sovereign of the Vánars reigned.
38854,BOOK IV.,He in his royal place controlled
38855,BOOK IV.,"The kingdom of our sires of old,"
38856,BOOK IV.,And I all faithful service lent
38857,BOOK IV.,To aid my brother's government.
38858,BOOK IV.,"The fiend Máyáví,--him of yore"
38859,BOOK IV.,"To Dundubhi(563) his mother bore,--"
38860,BOOK IV.,"For woman's love in strife engaged,"
38861,BOOK IV.,A deadly war with Báli waged.
38862,BOOK IV.,When sleep had chained each weary frame
38863,BOOK IV.,"To vast Kishkindhá(564) gates he came,"
38864,BOOK IV.,"And, shouting through the shades of night,"
38865,BOOK IV.,Challenged his foeman to the fight.
38866,BOOK IV.,"My brother heard the furious shout,"
38867,BOOK IV.,"And wild with rage rushed madly out,"
38868,BOOK IV.,Though fain would I and each sad wife
38869,BOOK IV.,Detain him from the deadly strife.
38870,BOOK IV.,"He burned his demon foe to slay,"
38871,BOOK IV.,And rushed impetuous to the fray.
38872,BOOK IV.,"His weeping wives he thrust aside,"
38873,BOOK IV.,"And forth, impelled by fury, hied;"
38874,BOOK IV.,"While, by my love and duty led,"
38875,BOOK IV.,I followed where my brother sped.
38876,BOOK IV.,"Máyáví looked, and at the sight"
38877,BOOK IV.,Fled from his foes in wild affright.
38878,BOOK IV.,"The flying fiend we quickly viewed,"
38879,BOOK IV.,And with swift feet his steps pursued.
38880,BOOK IV.,"Then rose the moon, whose friendly ray"
38881,BOOK IV.,Cast light upon our headlong way.
38882,BOOK IV.,By the soft beams was dimly shown
38883,BOOK IV.,A mighty cave with grass o'ergrown.
38884,BOOK IV.,"Within its depths he sprang, and we"
38885,BOOK IV.,The demon's form no more might see.
38886,BOOK IV.,My brother's breast was all aglow
38887,BOOK IV.,"With fury when he missed the foe,"
38888,BOOK IV.,"And, turning, thus to me he said"
38889,BOOK IV.,With senses all disquieted:
38890,BOOK IV.,"""Here by the cavern's mouth remain;"
38891,BOOK IV.,"Keep ear and eye upon the strain,"
38892,BOOK IV.,While I the dark recess explore
38893,BOOK IV.,"And dip my brand in foeman's gore."""
38894,BOOK IV.,"I heard his angry speech, and tried"
38895,BOOK IV.,To turn him from his plan aside.
38896,BOOK IV.,"He made me swear by both his feet,"
38897,BOOK IV.,And sped within the dark retreat.
38898,BOOK IV.,"While in the cave he stayed, and I"
38899,BOOK IV.,"Watched at the mouth, a year went by."
38900,BOOK IV.,"For his return I looked in vain,"
38901,BOOK IV.,"And, moved by love, believed him slain."
38902,BOOK IV.,"I mourned, by doubt and fear distressed,"
38903,BOOK IV.,And greater horror seized my breast
38904,BOOK IV.,"When from the cavern rolled a flood,"
38905,BOOK IV.,A carnage stream of froth and blood;
38906,BOOK IV.,"And from the depths a sound of fear,"
38907,BOOK IV.,"The roar of demons, smote mine ear;"
38908,BOOK IV.,But never rang my brother's shout
38909,BOOK IV.,Triumphant in the battle rout.
38910,BOOK IV.,"I closed the cavern with a block,"
38911,BOOK IV.,"Huge as a hill, of shattered rock."
38912,BOOK IV.,"Gave offerings due to Báli's shade,"
38913,BOOK IV.,"And sought Kishkindhá, sore dismayed."
38914,BOOK IV.,Long time with anxious care I tried
38915,BOOK IV.,"From Báli's lords his fate to hide,"
38916,BOOK IV.,"But they, when once the tale was known,"
38917,BOOK IV.,Placed me as king on Báli's throne.
38918,BOOK IV.,There for a while I justly reigned
38919,BOOK IV.,"And all with equal care ordained,"
38920,BOOK IV.,When joyous from the demon slain
38921,BOOK IV.,My brother Báli came again.
38922,BOOK IV.,"He found me ruling in his stead,"
38923,BOOK IV.,"And, fired with rage, his eyes grew red."
38924,BOOK IV.,"He slew the lords who made me king,"
38925,BOOK IV.,And spoke keen words to taunt and sting.
38926,BOOK IV.,The kingly rank and power I held
38927,BOOK IV.,"My brother's rage with ease had quelled,"
38928,BOOK IV.,"But still, restrained by old respect"
38929,BOOK IV.,"For claims of birth, the thought I checked."
38930,BOOK IV.,Thus having struck the demon down
38931,BOOK IV.,Came Báli to his royal town.
38932,BOOK IV.,"With meek respect, with humble speech,"
38933,BOOK IV.,His haughty heart I strove to reach.
38934,BOOK IV.,"But all my arts were tried in vain,"
38935,BOOK IV.,"No gentle word his lips would deign,"
38936,BOOK IV.,Though to the ground I bent and set

38967,BOOK IV.,My deep distress and downcast mien
38968,BOOK IV.,By citizen and lord were seen.
38969,BOOK IV.,They made me king against my will:
38970,BOOK IV.,Forgive me if the deed was ill.
38971,BOOK IV.,True as I ever was I see
38972,BOOK IV.,My honoured king once more in thee;
38973,BOOK IV.,I only ruled a while the state
38974,BOOK IV.,When thou hadst left us desolate.
38975,BOOK IV.,"This town with people, lords, and lands,"
38976,BOOK IV.,Lay as a trust in guardian hands:
38977,BOOK IV.,"And now, my gracious lord, accept"
38978,BOOK IV.,The kingdom which thy servant kept.
38979,BOOK IV.,"Forgive me, victor of the foe,"
38980,BOOK IV.,Nor let thy wrath against me glow.
38981,BOOK IV.,"See joining suppliant hands I pray,"
38982,BOOK IV.,And at thy feet my head I lay.
38983,BOOK IV.,Believe my words: against my will
38984,BOOK IV.,The royal seat they made me fill.
38985,BOOK IV.,"Unkinged they saw the city, hence"
38986,BOOK IV.,"They made me lord for her defence."""
38987,BOOK IV.,
38988,BOOK IV.,"But Báli, though I humbly sued,"
38989,BOOK IV.,Reviled me in his furious mood:
38990,BOOK IV.,"""Out on thee, wretch!"" in wrath he cried"
38991,BOOK IV.,With many a bitter taunt beside.
38992,BOOK IV.,"He summoned every lord, and all"
38993,BOOK IV.,His subjects gathered at his call.
38994,BOOK IV.,"Then forth his burning anger broke,"
38995,BOOK IV.,And thus amid his friends he spoke:
38996,BOOK IV.,"""I need not tell, for well ye know,"
38997,BOOK IV.,"How fierce Máyáví, fiend and foe,"
38998,BOOK IV.,"Came to Kishkindhá's gate by night,"
38999,BOOK IV.,And dared me in his wrath to fight.
39000,BOOK IV.,I heard each word the demon said:
39001,BOOK IV.,Forth from my royal hall I sped;
39002,BOOK IV.,"And, foe in brother's guise concealed,"
39003,BOOK IV.,Sugríva followed to the field.
39004,BOOK IV.,The mighty demon through the shade
39005,BOOK IV.,Beheld me come with one to aid:
39006,BOOK IV.,"Then shrinking from unequal fight,"
39007,BOOK IV.,He turned his back in swiftest flight.
39008,BOOK IV.,From vengeful foes his life to save
39009,BOOK IV.,He sought the refuge of a cave.
39010,BOOK IV.,Then when I saw the fiend had fled
39011,BOOK IV.,"Within that cavern dark and dread,"
39012,BOOK IV.,"Thus to my brother cruel-eyed,"
39013,BOOK IV.,"Impatient in my wrath, I cried:"
39014,BOOK IV.,"""I seek no more my royal town"
39015,BOOK IV.,Till I have struck the demon down.
39016,BOOK IV.,Here by the cavern's mouth remain
39017,BOOK IV.,"Until my hand the foe have slain."""
39018,BOOK IV.,"Upon his faith my heart relied,"
39019,BOOK IV.,And swift within the depths I hied.
39020,BOOK IV.,A year went by: in every spot
39021,BOOK IV.,"I sought the fiend, but found him not."
39022,BOOK IV.,"At length my foe I saw and slew,"
39023,BOOK IV.,Whom long I feared when lost to view;
39024,BOOK IV.,And all his kinsmen by his side
39025,BOOK IV.,Beneath my vengeful fury died.
39026,BOOK IV.,"The monster, as he reeled and fell,"
39027,BOOK IV.,Poured forth his blood with roar and yell;
39028,BOOK IV.,"And, filling all the cavern, dyed"
39029,BOOK IV.,The portal with the crimson tide.
39030,BOOK IV.,Upon my foeman slain at last
39031,BOOK IV.,"One look, one pitying look, I cast."
39032,BOOK IV.,I sought again the light of day:
39033,BOOK IV.,The cave was closed and left no way.
39034,BOOK IV.,"To the barred mouth I sadly came,"
39035,BOOK IV.,And called aloud Sugríva's name.
39036,BOOK IV.,"But all was still: no voice replied,"
39037,BOOK IV.,And hope within my bosom died.
39038,BOOK IV.,"With furious efforts, vain at first,"
39039,BOOK IV.,Through bars of rock my way I burst.
39040,BOOK IV.,"Then, free once more, the path that brought"
39041,BOOK IV.,My feet in safety home I sought.
39042,BOOK IV.,'Twas thus Sugríva dared despise
39043,BOOK IV.,The claim of brothers' friendly ties.
39044,BOOK IV.,"With crags of rock he barred me in,"
39045,BOOK IV.,"And for himself the realm would win."""
39046,BOOK IV.,
39047,BOOK IV.,Thus Báli spoke in words severe;
39048,BOOK IV.,"And then, unmoved by ruth or fear,"
39049,BOOK IV.,Left me a single robe and sent
39050,BOOK IV.,His brother forth in banishment.
39051,BOOK IV.,"He cast me out with scathe and scorn,"
39052,BOOK IV.,And from my side my wife was torn.
39053,BOOK IV.,Now in great fear and ill at ease
39054,BOOK IV.,"I roam this land with woods and seas,"
39055,BOOK IV.,"Or dwell on Rishyamúka's hill,"
39056,BOOK IV.,And sorrow for my consort still.
39057,BOOK IV.,Thou hast the tale how first arose
39058,BOOK IV.,This bitter hate of brother foes.
39059,BOOK IV.,"Such are the griefs neath which I pine,"
39060,BOOK IV.,And all without a fault of mine.
39061,BOOK IV.,"O swift to save in hour of fear,"
39062,BOOK IV.,"My prayer who dread this Báli, hear"
39063,BOOK IV.,"With gracious love assistance deign,"
39064,BOOK IV.,"And mine oppressor's arm restrain."""
39065,BOOK IV.,
39066,BOOK IV.,"Then Raghu's son, the good and brave,"
39067,BOOK IV.,With a gay laugh his answer gave:
39068,BOOK IV.,"""These shafts of mine which ne'er can fail,"
39069,BOOK IV.,"Before whose sheen the sun grows pale,"
39070,BOOK IV.,"Winged by my fury, fleet and fierce,"
39071,BOOK IV.,The wicked Báli's heart shall pierce.
39072,BOOK IV.,"Yea, mark the words I speak, so long"
39073,BOOK IV.,"Shall live that wretch who joys in wrong,"
39074,BOOK IV.,Until these angered eyes have seen
39075,BOOK IV.,The robber of thy darling queen.
39076,BOOK IV.,"I, taught by equal suffering, know"
39077,BOOK IV.,What waves of grief above thee flow.
39078,BOOK IV.,"This hand thy captive wife shall free,"
39079,BOOK IV.,"And give thy kingdom back to thee."""
39080,BOOK IV.,
39081,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva joyed as Ráma spoke,"
39082,BOOK IV.,And valour in his breast awoke.
39083,BOOK IV.,"His eye grew bright, his heart grew bold,"
39084,BOOK IV.,And thus his wondrous tale he told:
39085,BOOK IV.,
39086,BOOK IV.,
39087,BOOK IV.,
39088,BOOK IV.,
39089,BOOK IV.,Canto XI. Dundubhi.
39090,BOOK IV.,
39091,BOOK IV.,
39092,BOOK IV.,"""I doubt not, Prince, thy peerless might,"
39093,BOOK IV.,"Armed with these shafts so keen and bright,"
39094,BOOK IV.,"Like all-destroying fires of fate,"
39095,BOOK IV.,The worlds could burn and devastate.
39096,BOOK IV.,But lend thou first thy mind and ear
39097,BOOK IV.,Of Báli's power and might to hear.
39098,BOOK IV.,"How bold, how firm, in battle tried,"
39099,BOOK IV.,Is Báli's heart; and then decide.
39100,BOOK IV.,"From east to west, from south to north"
39101,BOOK IV.,"On restless errand hurrying forth,"
39102,BOOK IV.,From farthest sea to sea he flies
39103,BOOK IV.,Before the sun has lit the skies.
39104,BOOK IV.,"A mountain top he oft will seek,"
39105,BOOK IV.,"Tear from its root a towering peak,"
39106,BOOK IV.,"Hurl it aloft, as 'twere a ball,"
39107,BOOK IV.,And catch it ere to earth it fall.
39108,BOOK IV.,And many a tree that long has stood
39109,BOOK IV.,"In health and vigour in the wood,"
39110,BOOK IV.,"His single arm to earth will throw,"
39111,BOOK IV.,The marvels of his might to show.
39112,BOOK IV.,"Shaped like a bull, a monster bore"
39113,BOOK IV.,The name of Dundubhi of yore:
39114,BOOK IV.,"He matched in size a mountain height,"
39115,BOOK IV.,A thousand elephants in might.
39116,BOOK IV.,"By pride of wondrous gifts impelled,"
39117,BOOK IV.,"And strength he deemed unparalleled,"
39118,BOOK IV.,"To Ocean, lord of stream and brook,"
39119,BOOK IV.,"Athirst for war, his way he took."
39120,BOOK IV.,He reached the king of rolling waves
39121,BOOK IV.,"Whose gems are piled in sunless caves,"
39122,BOOK IV.,And threw his challenge to the sea;
39123,BOOK IV.,"""Come forth, O King, and fight with me."""
39124,BOOK IV.,"He spoke, and from his ocean bed"
39125,BOOK IV.,"The righteous(567) monarch heaved his head,"
39126,BOOK IV.,"And gave, sedate, his calm reply"
39127,BOOK IV.,To him whom fate impelled to die:
39128,BOOK IV.,"""Not mine, not mine the power,"" he cried,"
39129,BOOK IV.,"""To cope with thee in battle tried;"
39130,BOOK IV.,"But listen to my voice, and seek"
39131,BOOK IV.,The worthier foe of whom I speak.
39132,BOOK IV.,"The Lord of Hills, where hermits live"
39133,BOOK IV.,"And love the home his forests give,"
39134,BOOK IV.,"Whose child is Sankar's darling queen,(568)"
39135,BOOK IV.,The King of Snows is he I mean.
39136,BOOK IV.,"Deep caves has he, and dark boughs shade"
39137,BOOK IV.,The torrent and the wild cascade.
39138,BOOK IV.,From him expect the fierce delight
39139,BOOK IV.,"Which heroes feel in equal fight."""
39140,BOOK IV.,
39141,BOOK IV.,"He deemed that fear checked ocean's king,"
39142,BOOK IV.,"And, like an arrow from the string,"
39143,BOOK IV.,To the wild woods that clothe the side
39144,BOOK IV.,Of Lord Himálaya's hills he hied.
39145,BOOK IV.,"Then Dundubhi, with hideous roar,"
39146,BOOK IV.,Huge fragments from the summit tore
39147,BOOK IV.,"Vast as Airávat,(569) white with snow,"
39148,BOOK IV.,And hurled them to the plains below.
39149,BOOK IV.,"Then like a white cloud soft, serene,"
39150,BOOK IV.,The Lord of Mountains' form was seen.
39151,BOOK IV.,"It sat upon a lofty crest,"
39152,BOOK IV.,And thus the furious fiend addressed:
39153,BOOK IV.,"""Beseems thee not, O virtue's friend,"
39154,BOOK IV.,My mountain tops to rive and rend;
39155,BOOK IV.,"For I, the hermit's calm retreat,"
39156,BOOK IV.,"For deeds of war am all unmeet."""
39157,BOOK IV.,
39158,BOOK IV.,"The demon's eye with rage grew red,"
39159,BOOK IV.,And thus in furious tone he said:
39160,BOOK IV.,"""If thou from fear or sloth decline"
39161,BOOK IV.,"To match thy strength in war with mine,"
39162,BOOK IV.,"Where shall I find a champion, say,"
39163,BOOK IV.,"To meet me burning for the fray?"""
39164,BOOK IV.,"He spoke: Himálaya, skilled in lore"
39165,BOOK IV.,"Of eloquence, replied once more,"
39166,BOOK IV.,"And, angered in his righteous mind,"
39167,BOOK IV.,Addressed the chief of demon kind:
39168,BOOK IV.,"""The Vánar Báli, brave and wise,"
39169,BOOK IV.,"Son of the God who rules the skies,(570)"
39170,BOOK IV.,"Sways, glorious in his high renown,"
39171,BOOK IV.,Kishkindhá his imperial town.
39172,BOOK IV.,Well may that valiant lord who knows
39173,BOOK IV.,Each art of war his might oppose
39174,BOOK IV.,"To thine, in equal battle set,"
39175,BOOK IV.,As Namuehi(571) and Indra met.
39176,BOOK IV.,"Go, if thy soul desire the fray;"
39177,BOOK IV.,"To Báli's city speed away,"
39178,BOOK IV.,And that unconquered hero meet
39179,BOOK IV.,"Whose fame is high for warlike feat."""
39180,BOOK IV.,"He listened to the Lord of Snow,"
39181,BOOK IV.,"And, his proud heart with rage aglow,"
39182,BOOK IV.,Sped swift away and lighted down
39183,BOOK IV.,"By vast Kishkindhá, Báli's town."
39184,BOOK IV.,With pointed horns to strike and gore
39185,BOOK IV.,"The semblance of a bull he bore,"
39186,BOOK IV.,Huge as a cloud that downward bends
39187,BOOK IV.,Ere the full flood of rain descends.
39188,BOOK IV.,"Impelled by pride and rage and hate,"
39189,BOOK IV.,He thundered at Kishkindhá's gate;
39190,BOOK IV.,"And with his bellowing, like the sound"
39191,BOOK IV.,"Of pealing drums, he shook the ground,"
39192,BOOK IV.,He rent the earth and prostrate threw
39193,BOOK IV.,The trees that near the portal grew.
39194,BOOK IV.,King Báli from the bowers within
39195,BOOK IV.,Indignant heard the roar and din.
39196,BOOK IV.,"Then, moonlike mid the stars, with all"
39197,BOOK IV.,His dames he hurried to the wall;
39198,BOOK IV.,"And to the fiend this speech, expressed"
39199,BOOK IV.,"In clear and measured words, addressed:"
39200,BOOK IV.,"""Know me for monarch. Báli styled,"
39201,BOOK IV.,Of Vánar tribes that roam the wild.
39202,BOOK IV.,"Say why dost thou this gate molest,"
39203,BOOK IV.,And bellowing thus disturb our rest?
39204,BOOK IV.,"I know thee, mighty fiend: beware"
39205,BOOK IV.,"And guard thy life with wiser care."""
39206,BOOK IV.,"He spoke: and thus the fiend returned,"
39207,BOOK IV.,While red with rage his eyeballs burned:
39208,BOOK IV.,"""What! speak when all thy dames are nigh"
39209,BOOK IV.,And hero-like thy foe defy?
39210,BOOK IV.,"Come, meet me in the fight this day,"
39211,BOOK IV.,And learn my strength by bold assay.
39212,BOOK IV.,"Or shall I spare thee, and relent"
39213,BOOK IV.,Until the coming night be spent?
39214,BOOK IV.,Take then the respite of a night
39215,BOOK IV.,And yield thee to each soft delight.
39216,BOOK IV.,"Then, monarch of the Vánar race"
39217,BOOK IV.,With loving arms thy friends embrace.
39218,BOOK IV.,"Gifts on thy faithful lords bestow,"
39219,BOOK IV.,"Bid each and all farewell, and go."
39220,BOOK IV.,"Show in the streets once more thy face,"
39221,BOOK IV.,Install thy son to fill thy place.
39222,BOOK IV.,Dally a while with each dear dame;
39223,BOOK IV.,And then my strength thy pride shall tame
39224,BOOK IV.,"For, should I smite thee drunk with wine"
39225,BOOK IV.,"Enamoured of those dames of thine,"
39226,BOOK IV.,"Beneath diseases bowed and bent,"
39227,BOOK IV.,"Or weak, unarmed, or negligent,"
39228,BOOK IV.,My deed would merit hate and scorn
39229,BOOK IV.,"As his who slays the child unborn."""
39230,BOOK IV.,"Then Báli's soul with rage was fired,"
39231,BOOK IV.,Queen Tára and the dames retired;
39232,BOOK IV.,"And slowly, with a laugh of pride,"
39233,BOOK IV.,The king of Vánars thus replied:
39234,BOOK IV.,"""Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:"
39235,BOOK IV.,"Unless thy fear the fight decline,"
39236,BOOK IV.,"Come, meet me in the fray, and test"
39237,BOOK IV.,"The spirit of my valiant breast."""
39238,BOOK IV.,He spoke in wrath and high disdain;
39239,BOOK IV.,"And, laying down his golden chain,"
39240,BOOK IV.,"Gift of his sire Mahendra, dared"
39241,BOOK IV.,"The demon, for the fray prepared;"
39242,BOOK IV.,"Seized by the horns the monster, vast"
39243,BOOK IV.,"As a huge hill, and held him fast,"
39244,BOOK IV.,"Then fiercely dragged him round and round,"
39245,BOOK IV.,"And, shouting, hurled him to the ground."
39246,BOOK IV.,"Blood streaming from his ears, he rose,"
39247,BOOK IV.,And wild with fury strove the foes.
39248,BOOK IV.,"Then Báli, match for Indra's might,"
39249,BOOK IV.,With every arm renewed the fight.
39250,BOOK IV.,"He fought with fists, and feet, and knees,"
39251,BOOK IV.,"With fragments of the rock, and trees."
39252,BOOK IV.,"At last the monster's strength, assailed"
39253,BOOK IV.,"By Sakra's(572) conquering offspring, failed."
39254,BOOK IV.,Him Báli raised with mighty strain
39255,BOOK IV.,And dashed upon the ground again;
39256,BOOK IV.,"Where, bruised and shattered, in a tide"
39257,BOOK IV.,"Of rushing blood, the demon died."
39258,BOOK IV.,"King Báli saw the lifeless corse,"
39259,BOOK IV.,"And bending, with tremendous force"
39260,BOOK IV.,"Raised the huge bulk from where it lay,"
39261,BOOK IV.,And hurled it full a league away.
39262,BOOK IV.,"As through the air the body flew,"
39263,BOOK IV.,"Some blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,"
39264,BOOK IV.,Welled from his shattered jaw and fell
39265,BOOK IV.,By Saint Matanga's hermit cell:
39266,BOOK IV.,"Matanga saw, illustrious sage,"
39267,BOOK IV.,"Those drops defile his hermitage,"
39268,BOOK IV.,"And, as he marvelled whence they came,"
39269,BOOK IV.,Fierce anger filled his soul with flame:
39270,BOOK IV.,"""Who is the villain, evil-souled,"
39271,BOOK IV.,"With childish thoughts unwise and bold,"
39272,BOOK IV.,"Who is the impious wretch,"" he cried,"
39273,BOOK IV.,"""By whom my grove with blood is dyed?"""
39274,BOOK IV.,
39275,BOOK IV.,"Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,"
39276,BOOK IV.,"And hastened from the hermitage,"
39277,BOOK IV.,"When lo, before his wondering eyes"
39278,BOOK IV.,Lay the dead bull of mountain size.
39279,BOOK IV.,His hermit soul was nothing slow
39280,BOOK IV.,"The doer of the deed to know,"
39281,BOOK IV.,And thus the Vánar in a burst
39282,BOOK IV.,Of wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:
39283,BOOK IV.,"""Ne'er let that Vánar wander here,"
39284,BOOK IV.,"For, if he come, his death is near,"
39285,BOOK IV.,Whose impious hand with blood has dyed
39286,BOOK IV.,"The holy place where I abide,"
39287,BOOK IV.,Who threw this demon corse and made
39288,BOOK IV.,A ruin of the pleasant shade.
39289,BOOK IV.,If e'er he plant his wicked feet
39290,BOOK IV.,Within one league of my retreat;
39291,BOOK IV.,"Yea, if the villain come so nigh"
39292,BOOK IV.,That very hour he needs must die.
39293,BOOK IV.,And let the Vánar lords who dwell
39294,BOOK IV.,In the dark woods that skirt my cell
39295,BOOK IV.,"Obey my words, and speeding hence"
39296,BOOK IV.,Find them some meeter residence.
39297,BOOK IV.,"Here if they dare to stay, on all"
39298,BOOK IV.,The terrors of my curse shall fall.
39299,BOOK IV.,"They spoil the tender saplings, dear"
39300,BOOK IV.,"As children which I cherish here,"
39301,BOOK IV.,"Mar root and branch and leaf and spray,"
39302,BOOK IV.,And steal the ripening fruit away.
39303,BOOK IV.,"One day I grant, no further hour,"
39304,BOOK IV.,"To-morrow shall my curse have power,"
39305,BOOK IV.,And then each Vánar I may see
39306,BOOK IV.,"A stone through countless years shall be."""
39307,BOOK IV.,The Vánars heard the curse and hied
39308,BOOK IV.,From sheltering wood and mountain side.
39309,BOOK IV.,"King Báli marked their haste and dread,"
39310,BOOK IV.,And to the flying leaders said:
39311,BOOK IV.,"""Speak, Vánar chiefs, and tell me why"
39312,BOOK IV.,From Saint Matanga's grove ye fly
39313,BOOK IV.,To gather round me: is it well
39314,BOOK IV.,"With all who in those woodlands dwell?"""
39315,BOOK IV.,He spoke: the Vánar leaders told
39316,BOOK IV.,King Báli with his chain of gold
39317,BOOK IV.,"What curse the saint had on them laid,"
39318,BOOK IV.,Which drove them from their ancient shade.
39319,BOOK IV.,"Then royal Báli sought the sage,"
39320,BOOK IV.,With reverent hands to soothe his rage.
39321,BOOK IV.,"The holy man his suppliant spurned,"
39322,BOOK IV.,And to his cell in anger turned.
39323,BOOK IV.,"That curse on Báli sorely pressed,"
39324,BOOK IV.,And long his conscious soul distressed.
39325,BOOK IV.,Him still the curse and terror keep
39326,BOOK IV.,Afar from Rishyamúka's steep.
39327,BOOK IV.,"He dares not to the grove draw nigh,"
39328,BOOK IV.,Nay scarce will hither turn his eye.
39329,BOOK IV.,"We know what terrors warm him hence,"
39330,BOOK IV.,And roam these woods in confidence.
39331,BOOK IV.,"Look, Prince, before thee white and dry"
39332,BOOK IV.,"The demon's bones uncovered lie,"
39333,BOOK IV.,"Who, like a hill in bulk and length,"
39334,BOOK IV.,Fell ruind for his pride of strength.
39335,BOOK IV.,See those high Sál trees seven in row
39336,BOOK IV.,"That droop their mighty branches low,"
39337,BOOK IV.,"These at one grasp would Báli seize,"
39338,BOOK IV.,And leafless shake the trembling trees.
39339,BOOK IV.,"These tales I tell, O Prince, to show"
39340,BOOK IV.,The matchless power that arms the foe.
39341,BOOK IV.,How canst thou hope to slay him? how
39342,BOOK IV.,"Meet Báli in the battle now?"""
39343,BOOK IV.,
39344,BOOK IV.,Sugríva spoke and sadly sighed:
39345,BOOK IV.,And Lakshman with a laugh replied:
39346,BOOK IV.,"""What show of power, what proof and test"
39347,BOOK IV.,"May still the doubts that fill thy breast?"""
39348,BOOK IV.,
39349,BOOK IV.,He spoke. Sugríva thus replied:
39350,BOOK IV.,"""See yonder Sál trees side by side."
39351,BOOK IV.,King Báli here would take his stand
39352,BOOK IV.,"Grasping his bow with vigorous hand,"
39353,BOOK IV.,"And every arrow, keen and true,"
39354,BOOK IV.,Would strike its tree and pierce it through.
39355,BOOK IV.,"If Ráma now his bow will bend,"
39356,BOOK IV.,And through one trunk an arrow send;
39357,BOOK IV.,Or if his arm can raise and throw
39358,BOOK IV.,"Two hundred measures of his bow,"
39359,BOOK IV.,"Grasped by a foot and hurled through air,"
39360,BOOK IV.,"The demon bull that moulders there,"
39361,BOOK IV.,My heart will own his might and fain
39362,BOOK IV.,"Believe my foe already slain."""
39363,BOOK IV.,
39364,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva spoke inflamed with ire,"
39365,BOOK IV.,"Scanned Ráma with a glance of fire,"
39366,BOOK IV.,Pondered a while in silent mood.
39367,BOOK IV.,And thus again his speech renewed:
39368,BOOK IV.,"""All lands with Báli's glories ring,"
39369,BOOK IV.,"A valiant, strong, and mighty king;"

39372,BOOK IV.,"His wondrous deeds his might declare,"
39373,BOOK IV.,Deeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;
39374,BOOK IV.,And on this power reflecting still
39375,BOOK IV.,I roam on Rishyamúka's hill.
39376,BOOK IV.,"Awed by my brother's might I rove,"
39377,BOOK IV.,"In doubt and fear, from grove to grove,"
39378,BOOK IV.,"While Hanumán, my chosen friend,"
39379,BOOK IV.,And faithful lords my steps attend;
39380,BOOK IV.,"And now, O true to friendship's tie,"
39381,BOOK IV.,I hail in thee my best ally.
39382,BOOK IV.,"My surest refuge from my foes,"
39383,BOOK IV.,And steadfast as the Lord of Snows.
39384,BOOK IV.,"Still, when I muse how strong and bold"
39385,BOOK IV.,"Is cruel Báli, evil-souled,"
39386,BOOK IV.,"But ne'er, O chief of Raghu's line,"
39387,BOOK IV.,"Have seen what strength in war is thine,"
39388,BOOK IV.,Though in my heart I may not dare
39389,BOOK IV.,"Doubt thy great might, despise, compare,"
39390,BOOK IV.,Thoughts of his fearful deeds will rise
39391,BOOK IV.,And fill my soul with sad surmise.
39392,BOOK IV.,"Speech, form, and trust which naught may move"
39393,BOOK IV.,"Thy secret strength and glory prove,"

39396,BOOK IV.,
39397,BOOK IV.,"He ceased: and Ráma answered, while"
39398,BOOK IV.,Played o'er his lips a gracious smile:
39399,BOOK IV.,"""Not yet convinced? This clear assay"
39400,BOOK IV.,"Shall drive each lingering doubt away."""
39401,BOOK IV.,"Thus Ráma spoke his heart to cheer,"
39402,BOOK IV.,To Dundubhi's vast frame drew near:
39403,BOOK IV.,He touched it with his foot in play
39404,BOOK IV.,And sent it twenty leagues away.
39405,BOOK IV.,Sugríva marked what easy force
39406,BOOK IV.,Hurled through the air that demon's corse
39407,BOOK IV.,"Whose mighty bones were white and dried,"
39408,BOOK IV.,And to the son of Raghu cried:
39409,BOOK IV.,"""My brother Báli, when his might"
39410,BOOK IV.,"Was drunk and weary from the fight,"
39411,BOOK IV.,"Hurled forth the monster body, fresh"
39412,BOOK IV.,"With skin and sinews, blood and flesh."
39413,BOOK IV.,"Now flesh and blood are dried away,"
39414,BOOK IV.,"The crumbling bones are light as hay,"
39415,BOOK IV.,"Which thou, O Raghu's son, hast sent"
39416,BOOK IV.,Flying through air in merriment.
39417,BOOK IV.,This test alone is weak to show
39418,BOOK IV.,If thou be stronger or the foe.
39419,BOOK IV.,"By thee a heap of mouldering bone,"
39420,BOOK IV.,By him the recent corse was thrown.
39421,BOOK IV.,"Thy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:"
39422,BOOK IV.,"Come, pierce one tree: let this decide."
39423,BOOK IV.,Prepare thy ponderous bow and bring
39424,BOOK IV.,Close to thine ear the straining string.
39425,BOOK IV.,"On yonder Sál tree fix thine eye,"
39426,BOOK IV.,"And let the mighty arrow fly,"
39427,BOOK IV.,"I doubt not, chief, that I shall see"
39428,BOOK IV.,Thy pointed shaft transfix the tree.
39429,BOOK IV.,"Then come, assay the easy task,"
39430,BOOK IV.,And do for love the thing I ask.

39493,BOOK IV.,
39494,BOOK IV.,They sought Kishkindhá's gate and stood
39495,BOOK IV.,"Concealed by trees in densest wood,"
39496,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, to the fight addressed,"
39497,BOOK IV.,"More closely drew his cinctured vest,"
39498,BOOK IV.,And raised a wild sky-piercing shout
39499,BOOK IV.,To call the foeman Báli out.
39500,BOOK IV.,
39501,BOOK IV.,"Forth came impetuous Báli, stirred"
39502,BOOK IV.,To fury by the shout he heard.
39503,BOOK IV.,"So the great sun, ere night has ceased,"
39504,BOOK IV.,Springs up impatient to the east.
39505,BOOK IV.,Then fierce and wild the conflict raged
39506,BOOK IV.,"As hand to hand the foes engaged,"
39507,BOOK IV.,As though in battle mid the stars
39508,BOOK IV.,Fought Mercury and fiery Mars.(575)
39509,BOOK IV.,To highest pitch of frenzy wrought
39510,BOOK IV.,"With fists like thunderbolts they fought,"

39517,BOOK IV.,"So, while his bow was ready bent,"
39518,BOOK IV.,No life-destroying shaft he sent.
39519,BOOK IV.,Crushed down by Báli's mightier stroke
39520,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva's force now sank and broke,"
39521,BOOK IV.,"Who, hoping naught from Ráma's aid,"
39522,BOOK IV.,"To Rishyamúka fled dismayed,"
39523,BOOK IV.,"Weary, and faint, and wounded sore,"
39524,BOOK IV.,"His body bruised and dyed with gore,"
39525,BOOK IV.,"From Báli's blows, in rage and dread,"
39526,BOOK IV.,Afar to sheltering woods he fled.
39527,BOOK IV.,
39528,BOOK IV.,"Nor Báli farther dared pursue,"
39529,BOOK IV.,The curbing curse too well he knew.
39530,BOOK IV.,"""Fled from thy death!"" the victor cried,"
39531,BOOK IV.,And home the mighty warrior hied.
39532,BOOK IV.,"Hanúmán, Lakshman, Raghu's son"

39534,BOOK IV.,And followed to the sheltering shade
39535,BOOK IV.,Where yet Sugríva stood dismayed.
39536,BOOK IV.,"Near and more near the chieftains came,"
39537,BOOK IV.,"Then, for intolerable shame,"
39538,BOOK IV.,"Not daring yet to lift his eyes,"
39539,BOOK IV.,Sugríva spoke with burning sighs:
39540,BOOK IV.,"""Thy matchless strength I first beheld,"

39548,BOOK IV.,
39549,BOOK IV.,"The Vánar sovereign, lofty-souled,"
39550,BOOK IV.,In plaintive voice his sorrows told.
39551,BOOK IV.,"Then Ráma spake: ""Sugríva, list,"

39553,BOOK IV.,And I will tell the cause that stayed
39554,BOOK IV.,"Mine arrow, and withheld the aid."
39555,BOOK IV.,"In dress, adornment, port, and height,"
39556,BOOK IV.,"In splendour, battle-shout, and might,"
39557,BOOK IV.,No shade of difference could I see
39558,BOOK IV.,"Between thy foe, O King, and thee."
39559,BOOK IV.,"So like was each, I stood at gaze,"
39560,BOOK IV.,"My senses lost in wildering maze,"
39561,BOOK IV.,Nor loosened from my straining bow
39562,BOOK IV.,"A deadly arrow at the foe,"
39563,BOOK IV.,Lest in my doubt the shaft should send
39564,BOOK IV.,To sudden death our surest friend.
39565,BOOK IV.,"O, if this hand in heedless guilt"
39566,BOOK IV.,"And rash resolve thy blood had spilt,"
39567,BOOK IV.,"Through every land, O Vánar King,"

39569,BOOK IV.,Sore weight of sin on him must lie
39570,BOOK IV.,By whom a friend is made to die;
39571,BOOK IV.,"And Lakshman, I, and Sítá, best"

39573,BOOK IV.,"On, warrior! for the fight prepare;"
39574,BOOK IV.,Nor fear again thy foe to dare.
39575,BOOK IV.,Within one hour thine eye shall view

39597,BOOK IV.,"As by his comrade's side he strode,"

39611,BOOK IV.,The hero in his warrior hold
39612,BOOK IV.,"Raised his great bow adorned with gold,"

39618,BOOK IV.,"With Hanumán of lofty mind,"
39619,BOOK IV.,"And valiant Tára, last in place,"
39620,BOOK IV.,A leader of the Vánar race.
39621,BOOK IV.,They gazed on many a tree that showed
39622,BOOK IV.,"The glory of its pendent load,"
39623,BOOK IV.,And brook and limpid rill that made
39624,BOOK IV.,Sweet murmurs as they seaward strayed.
39625,BOOK IV.,"They looked on caverns dark and deep,"
39626,BOOK IV.,"On bower and glen and mountain steep,"
39627,BOOK IV.,And saw the opening lotus stud
39628,BOOK IV.,"With roseate cup the crystal flood,"
39629,BOOK IV.,While crane and swan and coot and drake
39630,BOOK IV.,"Made pleasant music on the lake,"
39631,BOOK IV.,And from the reedy bank was heard
39632,BOOK IV.,The note of many a happy bird.
39633,BOOK IV.,"In open lawns, in tangled ways,"
39634,BOOK IV.,"They saw the tall deer stand at gaze,"

39636,BOOK IV.,"Fed with sweet grass, their woodland home."
39637,BOOK IV.,At times two flashing tusks between
39638,BOOK IV.,"The wavings of the wood were seen,"
39639,BOOK IV.,"And some mad elephant, alone,"
39640,BOOK IV.,"Like a huge moving hill, was shown."
39641,BOOK IV.,And scarcely less in size appeared
39642,BOOK IV.,Great monkeys all with dust besmeared.
39643,BOOK IV.,"And various birds that roam the skies,"
39644,BOOK IV.,"And silvan creatures, met their eyes,"
39645,BOOK IV.,"As through the wood the chieftains sped,"
39646,BOOK IV.,And followed where Sugríva led.
39647,BOOK IV.,
39648,BOOK IV.,"Then Ráma, as their way they made,"
39649,BOOK IV.,"Saw near at hand a lovely shade,"
39650,BOOK IV.,"And, as he gazed upon the trees,"

39652,BOOK IV.,"""Those stately trees in beauty rise,"
39653,BOOK IV.,Fair as a cloud in autumn skies.
39654,BOOK IV.,"I fain, my friend, would learn from thee"

39656,BOOK IV.,
39657,BOOK IV.,"Thus Ráma spake, the mighty souled;"
39658,BOOK IV.,And thus his tale Sugríva told:
39659,BOOK IV.,
39660,BOOK IV.,"""That, Ráma, is a wide retreat"

39662,BOOK IV.,"Bright streams and fruit and roots are there,"
39663,BOOK IV.,And shady gardens passing fair.
39664,BOOK IV.,"There, neath the roof of hanging boughs,"
39665,BOOK IV.,The sacred Seven maintained their vows.
39666,BOOK IV.,"Their heads in dust were lowly laid,"
39667,BOOK IV.,In streams their nightly beds were made.
39668,BOOK IV.,"Each seventh night they broke their fast,"
39669,BOOK IV.,"But air was still their sole repast,"
39670,BOOK IV.,And when seven hundred years were spent
39671,BOOK IV.,To homes in heaven the hermits went.
39672,BOOK IV.,"Their glory keeps the garden yet,"
39673,BOOK IV.,With walls of stately trees beset.
39674,BOOK IV.,"Scarce would the Gods and demons dare,"
39675,BOOK IV.,"By Indra led, to enter there."
39676,BOOK IV.,"No beast that roams the wood is found,"
39677,BOOK IV.,"No bird of air, within the bound;"
39678,BOOK IV.,"Or, thither if they idly stray,"
39679,BOOK IV.,They find no more their homeward way.
39680,BOOK IV.,You hear at times mid dulcet tones
39681,BOOK IV.,"The chime of anklets, rings, and zones."
39682,BOOK IV.,"You hear the song and music sound,"
39683,BOOK IV.,"And heavenly fragrance breathes around,"
39684,BOOK IV.,There duly burn the triple fires(577)
39685,BOOK IV.,"Where mounts the smoke in curling spires,"
39686,BOOK IV.,"And, in a dun wreath, hangs above"
39687,BOOK IV.,"The tall trees, like a brooding dove."
39688,BOOK IV.,Round branch and crest the vapours close
39689,BOOK IV.,Till every tree enveloped shows
39690,BOOK IV.,A hill of lazulite when clouds
39691,BOOK IV.,Hang round it with their misty shrouds.
39692,BOOK IV.,"With Lakshman, lord of Raghu's line,"
39693,BOOK IV.,"In reverent guise thine head incline,"

39696,BOOK IV.,They who with faithful hearts revere

39705,BOOK IV.,Beyond the sainted Seven's abode
39706,BOOK IV.,"Far on their way the chieftains strode,"
39707,BOOK IV.,"And great Kishkindhá's portal gained,"

39709,BOOK IV.,Then by the gate they took their stand
39710,BOOK IV.,"All ready armed a noble band,"
39711,BOOK IV.,And burning every one
39712,BOOK IV.,"To slay in battle, hand to hand,"

39723,BOOK IV.,O'er all the garden's pleasant shade
39724,BOOK IV.,"The eyes of King Sugríva strayed,"
39725,BOOK IV.,"And, as on grass and tree he gazed,"
39726,BOOK IV.,The fires of wrath within him blazed.
39727,BOOK IV.,"Then like a mighty cloud on high,"
39728,BOOK IV.,"When roars the tempest through the sky,"
39729,BOOK IV.,Girt by his friends he thundered out
39730,BOOK IV.,His dread sky-rending battle-shout
39731,BOOK IV.,"Like some proud lion in his gait,"
39732,BOOK IV.,"Or as the sun begins his state,"
39733,BOOK IV.,Sugríva let his quick glance rest
39734,BOOK IV.,On Ráma whom he thus addressed:
39735,BOOK IV.,"""There is the seat of Báli's sway,"
39736,BOOK IV.,"Where flags on wall and turret play,"
39737,BOOK IV.,"Which mighty bands of Vánars hold,"
39738,BOOK IV.,Rich in all arms and store of gold.
39739,BOOK IV.,Thy promise to thy mind recall
39740,BOOK IV.,That Báli by thy hand shall fall.
39741,BOOK IV.,As kindly fruits adorn the bough.
39742,BOOK IV.,"So give my hopes their harvest now."""
39743,BOOK IV.,
39744,BOOK IV.,"In suppliant tone the Vánar prayed,"
39745,BOOK IV.,And Raghu's son his answer made:
39746,BOOK IV.,"""By Lakshman's hand this flowery twine"
39747,BOOK IV.,Was wound about thee for a sign.
39748,BOOK IV.,The wreath of giant creeper throws
39749,BOOK IV.,"About thy form its brillant glows,"
39750,BOOK IV.,As though about the sun were set
39751,BOOK IV.,The bright stars for a coronet.
39752,BOOK IV.,"One shaft of mine this day, dear friend,"
39753,BOOK IV.,Thy sorrow and thy fear shall end.
39754,BOOK IV.,"And, from the bowstring freed, shall be"
39755,BOOK IV.,"Giver of freedom, King, to thee."
39756,BOOK IV.,"Then come, Sugríva, quickly show,"
39757,BOOK IV.,"Where'er he lie, thy bitter foe;"
39758,BOOK IV.,And let my glance the wretch descry
39759,BOOK IV.,"Whose deeds, a brother's name belie."
39760,BOOK IV.,"Yea, soon in dust and blood o'erthrown"
39761,BOOK IV.,Shall Báli fall and gasp and groan.
39762,BOOK IV.,"Once let this eye the foeman see,"

39767,BOOK IV.,Through seven tall trees one arrow wing?
39768,BOOK IV.,"Still in that strength securely trust,"
39769,BOOK IV.,And deem thy foeman in the dust.
39770,BOOK IV.,"In all my days, though surely tried"
39771,BOOK IV.,"By grief and woe, I ne'er have lied;"
39772,BOOK IV.,And still by duty's law restrained
39773,BOOK IV.,Will ne'er with falsehood's charge be stained.
39774,BOOK IV.,Cast doubt away: the oath I sware
39775,BOOK IV.,"Its kindly fruit shall quickly bear,"
39776,BOOK IV.,As smiles the land with golden grain
39777,BOOK IV.,By mercy of the Lord of rain.
39778,BOOK IV.,"Oh, warrior to the gate I defy"
39779,BOOK IV.,"Thy foe with shout and battle-cry,"
39780,BOOK IV.,Till Báli with his chain of gold
39781,BOOK IV.,Come speeding from his royal hold.
39782,BOOK IV.,"Proud hearts, with warlike fire aglow,"
39783,BOOK IV.,Brook not the challenge of a foe:
39784,BOOK IV.,"Each on his power and might relies,"
39785,BOOK IV.,And most before his ladies eyes.
39786,BOOK IV.,King Báli loves the fray too well
39787,BOOK IV.,"To linger in his citadel,"
39788,BOOK IV.,"And, when he hears thy battle-shout,"
39789,BOOK IV.,"All wild for war will hasten out."""
39790,BOOK IV.,
39791,BOOK IV.,He spoke. Sugríva raised a cry
39792,BOOK IV.,"That shook and rent the echoing sky,"
39793,BOOK IV.,A shout so fierce and loud and dread
39794,BOOK IV.,"That stately bulls in terror fled,"
39795,BOOK IV.,Like dames who fly from threatened stain
39796,BOOK IV.,In some ignoble monarch's reign.
39797,BOOK IV.,The deer in wild confusion ran
39798,BOOK IV.,Like horses turned in battle's van.
39799,BOOK IV.,"Down fell the birds, like Gods who fall"
39800,BOOK IV.,"When merits fail,(578) at that dread call."
39801,BOOK IV.,"So fiercely, boldened for the fray,"
39802,BOOK IV.,The offspring of the Lord of Day
39803,BOOK IV.,Sent forth his furious shout as loud
39804,BOOK IV.,"As thunder from a labouring cloud,"
39805,BOOK IV.,"Or, where the gale blows fresh and free,"
39806,BOOK IV.,The roaring of the troubled sea.
39807,BOOK IV.,
39808,BOOK IV.,
39809,BOOK IV.,
39810,BOOK IV.,
39811,BOOK IV.,Canto XV. Tárá.
39812,BOOK IV.,
39813,BOOK IV.,
39814,BOOK IV.,"That shout, which shook the land with fear,"
39815,BOOK IV.,"In thunder smote on Báli's ear,"
39816,BOOK IV.,Where in the chamber barred and closed
39817,BOOK IV.,The sovereign with his dame reposed.
39818,BOOK IV.,"Each amorous thought was rudely stilled,"
39819,BOOK IV.,And pride and rage his bosom filled.
39820,BOOK IV.,"His angry eyes flashed darkly red,"
39821,BOOK IV.,"And all his native brightness fled,"
39822,BOOK IV.,"As when, by swift eclipse assailed,"
39823,BOOK IV.,The glory of the sun has failed.
39824,BOOK IV.,While in his fury uncontrolled
39825,BOOK IV.,"He ground his teeth, his eyeballs rolled,"
39826,BOOK IV.,He seemed a lake wherein no gem
39827,BOOK IV.,Of blossom decks the lotus stem.
39828,BOOK IV.,"He heard, and with indignant pride"
39829,BOOK IV.,Forth from the bower the Vánar hied.
39830,BOOK IV.,And the earth trembled at the beat
39831,BOOK IV.,And fury of his hastening feet.
39832,BOOK IV.,"But Tárá to her consort flew,"
39833,BOOK IV.,"Her loving arms around him threw,"
39834,BOOK IV.,"And trembling and bewildered, gave"
39835,BOOK IV.,Wise counsel that might heal and save:
39836,BOOK IV.,"""O dear my lord, this rage control"
39837,BOOK IV.,"That like a torrent floods thy soul,"
39838,BOOK IV.,And cast these idle thoughts away
39839,BOOK IV.,"Like faded wreath of yesterday,"
39840,BOOK IV.,"O tarry till the morning light,"
39841,BOOK IV.,"Then, if thou wilt, go forth and fight."
39842,BOOK IV.,"Think not I doubt thy valour, no;"
39843,BOOK IV.,"Or deem thee weaker than thy foe,"
39844,BOOK IV.,Yet for a while would have thee stay
39845,BOOK IV.,Nor see thee tempt the fight to-day.
39846,BOOK IV.,"Now list, my loving lord, and learn"
39847,BOOK IV.,The reason why I bid thee turn.
39848,BOOK IV.,"Thy foeman came in wrath and pride,"
39849,BOOK IV.,And thee to deadly fight defied.
39850,BOOK IV.,"Thou wentest out: he fought, and fled"
39851,BOOK IV.,Sore wounded and discomfited.
39852,BOOK IV.,"But yet, untaught by late defeat,"
39853,BOOK IV.,"He comes his conquering foe to meet,"
39854,BOOK IV.,And calls thee forth with cry and shout:
39855,BOOK IV.,"Hence spring, my lord, this fear and doubt."
39856,BOOK IV.,"A heart so bold that will not yield,"
39857,BOOK IV.,"But yearns to tempt the desperate field,"
39858,BOOK IV.,"Such loud defiance, fiercely pressed,"
39859,BOOK IV.,On no uncertain hope can rest.
39860,BOOK IV.,"So lately by thine arm o'erthrown,"
39861,BOOK IV.,"He comes not back, I ween, alone."
39862,BOOK IV.,"Some mightier comrade guards his side,"
39863,BOOK IV.,And spurs him to this burst of pride.
39864,BOOK IV.,For nature made the Vánar wise:
39865,BOOK IV.,On arms of might his hope relies;
39866,BOOK IV.,And never will Sugríva seek
39867,BOOK IV.,A friend whose power to save is weak.
39868,BOOK IV.,Now listen while my lips unfold
39869,BOOK IV.,The wondrous tale my Angad told.
39870,BOOK IV.,"Our child the distant forest sought,"
39871,BOOK IV.,"And, learnt from spies, the tidings brought."
39872,BOOK IV.,"Two sons of Dasaratha, sprung"
39873,BOOK IV.,"From old Ikshváku, brave and young,"
39874,BOOK IV.,"Renowned in arms, in war untamed--"
39875,BOOK IV.,Ráma and Lakshman are they named--
39876,BOOK IV.,Have with thy foe Sugríva made
39877,BOOK IV.,A league of love and friendly aid.
39878,BOOK IV.,"Now Ráma, famed for exploit high,"
39879,BOOK IV.,"Is bound thy brother's firm ally,"
39880,BOOK IV.,Like fires of doom(579) that ruin all
39881,BOOK IV.,He makes each foe before him fall.
39882,BOOK IV.,"He is the suppliant's sure defence,"
39883,BOOK IV.,The tree that shelters innocence.
39884,BOOK IV.,The poor and wretched seek his feet:
39885,BOOK IV.,In him the noblest glories meet.
39886,BOOK IV.,With skill and knowledge vast and deep
39887,BOOK IV.,His sire's commands he loved to keep;
39888,BOOK IV.,With princely gifts and graces stored
39889,BOOK IV.,As metals deck the Mountains' Lord.(580)
39890,BOOK IV.,"Thou canst not, O my hero, stand"
39891,BOOK IV.,Before the might of Ráma's hand;
39892,BOOK IV.,For none may match his powers or dare
39893,BOOK IV.,With him in deeds of war compare.
39894,BOOK IV.,"Hear, I entreat, the words I say,"
39895,BOOK IV.,Nor lightly turn my rede away.
39896,BOOK IV.,"O let fraternal discord cease,"
39897,BOOK IV.,And link you in the bonds of peace.
39898,BOOK IV.,Let consecrating rites ordain
39899,BOOK IV.,Sugríva partner of thy reign.
39900,BOOK IV.,"Let war and thoughts of conflict end,"
39901,BOOK IV.,"And be thou his and Ráma's friend,"
39902,BOOK IV.,"Each soft approach of love begin,"
39903,BOOK IV.,And to thy soul thy brother win;
39904,BOOK IV.,"For whether here or there he be,"
39905,BOOK IV.,"Thy brother still, dear lord, is he."
39906,BOOK IV.,Though far and wide these eyes I strain
39907,BOOK IV.,A friend like him I seek in vain.
39908,BOOK IV.,"Let gentle words his heart incline,"
39909,BOOK IV.,"And gifts and honours make him thine,"
39910,BOOK IV.,"Till, foes no more, in love allied,"
39911,BOOK IV.,You stand as brothers side by side.
39912,BOOK IV.,Thou in high rank wast wont to hold
39913,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, formed in massive mould;"
39914,BOOK IV.,"Then come, thy brother's love regain,"
39915,BOOK IV.,For other aids are weak and vain.
39916,BOOK IV.,"If thou would please my soul, and still"
39917,BOOK IV.,"Preserve me from all fear and ill,"
39918,BOOK IV.,I pray thee by thy love be wise
39919,BOOK IV.,And do the thing which I advise.
39920,BOOK IV.,"Assuage thy fruitless wrath, and shun"
39921,BOOK IV.,The mightier arms of Raghu's son;
39922,BOOK IV.,"For Indra's peer in might is he,"
39923,BOOK IV.,"A foe too strong, my lord, for thee."""

39929,BOOK IV.,
39930,BOOK IV.,
39931,BOOK IV.,Thus Tárá with the starry eyes(581)
39932,BOOK IV.,Her counsel gave with burning sighs.
39933,BOOK IV.,"But Báli, by her prayers unmoved,"
39934,BOOK IV.,"Spurned her advice, and thus reproved:"
39935,BOOK IV.,"""How may this insult, scathe, and scorn"
39936,BOOK IV.,"By me, dear love, be tamely born?"
39937,BOOK IV.,"My brother, yea my foe, comes nigh"
39938,BOOK IV.,And dares me forth with shout and cry.
39939,BOOK IV.,"Learn, trembler! that the valiant, they"
39940,BOOK IV.,"Who yield no step in battle fray,"
39941,BOOK IV.,Will die a thousand deaths but ne'er
39942,BOOK IV.,An unavenged dishonour bear.
39943,BOOK IV.,"Nor, O my love, be thou dismayed"
39944,BOOK IV.,"Though Ráma lend Sugríva aid,"
39945,BOOK IV.,"For one so pure and duteous, one"
39946,BOOK IV.,"Who loves the right, all sin will shun,"
39947,BOOK IV.,"Release me from thy soft embrace,"
39948,BOOK IV.,And with thy dames thy steps retrace:
39949,BOOK IV.,"Enough already, O mine own,"
39950,BOOK IV.,Of love and sweet devotion shown.
39951,BOOK IV.,Drive all thy fear and doubt away;
39952,BOOK IV.,I seek Sugríva in the fray
39953,BOOK IV.,"His boisterous rage and pride to still,"
39954,BOOK IV.,And tame the foe I would not kill.
39955,BOOK IV.,"My fury, armed with brandished trees,"
39956,BOOK IV.,Shall strike Sugríva to his knees:
39957,BOOK IV.,Nor shall the humbled foe withstand
39958,BOOK IV.,"The blows of my avenging hand,"
39959,BOOK IV.,"When, nerved by rage and pride, I beat"
39960,BOOK IV.,The traitor down beneath my feet.
39961,BOOK IV.,"Thou, love, hast lent thine own sweet aid,"
39962,BOOK IV.,And all thy tender care displayed;
39963,BOOK IV.,"Now by my life, by these who yearn"
39964,BOOK IV.,"To serve thee well, I pray thee turn."
39965,BOOK IV.,"But for a while, dear dame, I go"
39966,BOOK IV.,"To come triumphant o'er the foe."""
39967,BOOK IV.,
39968,BOOK IV.,Thus Báli spake in gentlest tone:
39969,BOOK IV.,Soft arms about his neck were thrown;
39970,BOOK IV.,Then round her lord the lady went
39971,BOOK IV.,With sad steps slow and reverent.
39972,BOOK IV.,She stood in solemn guise to bless
39973,BOOK IV.,"With prayers for safety and success,"
39974,BOOK IV.,Then with her train her chamber sought
39975,BOOK IV.,By grief and racking fear distraught.
39976,BOOK IV.,
39977,BOOK IV.,With serpent's pantings fierce and fast
39978,BOOK IV.,King Báli from the city passed.
39979,BOOK IV.,"His glance, as each quick breath he drew,"
39980,BOOK IV.,"Around to find the foe he threw,"
39981,BOOK IV.,And saw where fierce Sugríva showed
39982,BOOK IV.,"His form with golden hues that glowed,"
39983,BOOK IV.,"And, as a fire resplendent, stayed"
39984,BOOK IV.,To meet his foe in arms arrayed.
39985,BOOK IV.,"When Báli, long-armed chieftain, found"
39986,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva stationed on the ground,"
39987,BOOK IV.,Impelled by warlike rage he braced
39988,BOOK IV.,"His warrior garb about his waist,"
39989,BOOK IV.,And with his mighty arm raised high
39990,BOOK IV.,Rushed at Sugríva with a cry.
39991,BOOK IV.,"But when Sugríva, fierce and bold,"
39992,BOOK IV.,"Saw Báli with his chain of gold,"
39993,BOOK IV.,"His arm he heaved, his hand he closed,"
39994,BOOK IV.,And face to face his foe opposed.
39995,BOOK IV.,"To him whose eyes with fury shone,"
39996,BOOK IV.,"In charge impetuous rushing on,"
39997,BOOK IV.,"Skilled in each warlike art and plan,"
39998,BOOK IV.,Báli with hasty words began:
39999,BOOK IV.,"""My ponderous hand, to fight addressed"
40000,BOOK IV.,With fingers clenched and arm compressed
40001,BOOK IV.,Shall on thy death doomed brow descend
40002,BOOK IV.,"And, crashing down, thy life shall end."""
40003,BOOK IV.,"He spoke; and wild with rage and pride,"
40004,BOOK IV.,The fierce Sugríva thus replied:
40005,BOOK IV.,"""Thus let my arm begin the strife"
40006,BOOK IV.,"And from thy body crush the life."""
40007,BOOK IV.,
40008,BOOK IV.,"Then Báli, wounded and enraged,"
40009,BOOK IV.,With furious blows the battle waged.
40010,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva seemed, with blood-streams dyed,"
40011,BOOK IV.,A hill with fountains in his side.
40012,BOOK IV.,But with his native force unspent
40013,BOOK IV.,"A Sál tree from the earth he rent,"
40014,BOOK IV.,And like the bolt of Indra smote
40015,BOOK IV.,On Báli's head and chest and throat.
40016,BOOK IV.,"Bruised by the blows he could not shield,"
40017,BOOK IV.,"Half vanquished Báli sank and reeled,"
40018,BOOK IV.,As sinks a vessel with her freight
40019,BOOK IV.,Borne down by overwhelming weight.
40020,BOOK IV.,Swift as Suparna's(582) swiftest flight
40021,BOOK IV.,In awful strength they rushed to fight:
40022,BOOK IV.,So might the sun and moon on high
40023,BOOK IV.,Encountering battle in the sky.
40024,BOOK IV.,"Fierce and more fierce, as fought the foes,"
40025,BOOK IV.,The furious rage of combat rose.
40026,BOOK IV.,"They warred with feet and arms and knees,"
40027,BOOK IV.,"With nails and stones and boughs and trees,"
40028,BOOK IV.,And blows descending fast as rain
40029,BOOK IV.,"Dyed each dark form with crimson stain,"
40030,BOOK IV.,While like two thunder-clouds they met
40031,BOOK IV.,With battle-cry and shout and threat.
40032,BOOK IV.,"Then Ráma saw Sugríva quail,"
40033,BOOK IV.,Marked his worn strength grow weak and fail.
40034,BOOK IV.,Saw how he turned his wistful eye
40035,BOOK IV.,To every quarter of the sky.
40036,BOOK IV.,"His friend's defeat he could not brook,"
40037,BOOK IV.,"Bent on his shaft an eager look,"
40038,BOOK IV.,"Then burned to slay the conquering foe,"
40039,BOOK IV.,And laid his arrow on the bow.
40040,BOOK IV.,As to an orb the bow he drew
40041,BOOK IV.,Forth from the string the arrow flew
40042,BOOK IV.,Like Fate's tremendous discus hurled
40043,BOOK IV.,By Yáma(583) forth to end the world.
40044,BOOK IV.,So loud the din that every bird
40045,BOOK IV.,"The bow-string's clans with terror heard,"
40046,BOOK IV.,And wildly fled the affrighted deer
40047,BOOK IV.,As though the day of doom were near.
40048,BOOK IV.,"So, deadly as the serpent's fang,"
40049,BOOK IV.,Forth from the string the arrow sprang.
40050,BOOK IV.,Like the red lightning's flash and flame
40051,BOOK IV.,"It flew unerring to its aim,"
40052,BOOK IV.,"And, hissing murder through the air,"
40053,BOOK IV.,"Pierced Báli's breast, and quivered there."
40054,BOOK IV.,Struck by the shaft that flew so well
40055,BOOK IV.,"The mighty Vánar reeled and fell,"
40056,BOOK IV.,As earthward Indra's flag they pull

40068,BOOK IV.,"Clad in the sheen of glistening gold,"
40069,BOOK IV.,As when uptorn the standard lies
40070,BOOK IV.,Of the great God who rules the skies.
40071,BOOK IV.,When low upon the earth was laid
40072,BOOK IV.,"The lord whom Vánar tribes obeyed,"
40073,BOOK IV.,Dark as a moonless sky no more
40074,BOOK IV.,His land her joyous aspect wore.
40075,BOOK IV.,Though low in dust and mire was rolled
40076,BOOK IV.,"The form of Báli lofty-souled,"
40077,BOOK IV.,"Still life and valour, might and grace"

40079,BOOK IV.,"That golden chain with rich gems set,"

40116,BOOK IV.,"""What fame, from one thou hast not slain"
40117,BOOK IV.,"In front of battle, canst thou gain,"
40118,BOOK IV.,Whose secret hand has laid me low
40119,BOOK IV.,When madly fighting with my foe?
40120,BOOK IV.,"From every tongue thy glory rings,"
40121,BOOK IV.,"A scion of a line of kings,"
40122,BOOK IV.,"True to thy vows, of noblest race,"
40123,BOOK IV.,With every gentle gift and grace:
40124,BOOK IV.,"Whose tender heart for woe can feel,"

40138,BOOK IV.,To strike me as I fought my foe
40139,BOOK IV.,"And thought not of a stranger's blow,"
40140,BOOK IV.,"But now thine evil heart is shown,"

40144,BOOK IV.,"I took thee not for treacherous fire,"

40148,BOOK IV.,"In fenced town, in open land,"
40149,BOOK IV.,"Ne'er hast thou suffered at this hand,"

40166,BOOK IV.,"Truth, valour, justice free from spot,"
40167,BOOK IV.,"The hand that gives and grudges not,"
40168,BOOK IV.,"The might that strikes the sinner down,"
40169,BOOK IV.,These bring a prince his best renown.
40170,BOOK IV.,"Here in the woods, O King, we live"
40171,BOOK IV.,On roots and fruit which branches give.(589)
40172,BOOK IV.,Thus nature framed our harmless race:
40173,BOOK IV.,Thou art a man supreme in place.
40174,BOOK IV.,Silver and gold and land provoke
40175,BOOK IV.,"The fierce attack, the robber's stroke,"
40176,BOOK IV.,"Canst thou desire this wild retreat,"

40178,BOOK IV.,'Tis not for mighty kings to tread
40179,BOOK IV.,"The flowery path, by pleasure led."
40180,BOOK IV.,"Theirs be the arm that crushes sin,"
40181,BOOK IV.,Theirs the soft grace to woo and win:
40182,BOOK IV.,"The steadfast will that guides the state,"
40183,BOOK IV.,Wise favour to the good and great;
40184,BOOK IV.,And for all time are kings renowned
40185,BOOK IV.,Who blend these arts and ne'er confound.
40186,BOOK IV.,"But thou art weak and swift to ire,"
40187,BOOK IV.,"Unstable, slave of each desire."
40188,BOOK IV.,"Thou tramplest duty in the dust,"
40189,BOOK IV.,And in thy bow is all thy trust.
40190,BOOK IV.,"Thou carest naught for noble gain,"
40191,BOOK IV.,"And treatest virtue with disdain,"
40192,BOOK IV.,While every sense its captive draws
40193,BOOK IV.,To follow pleasure's changing laws.
40194,BOOK IV.,"I wronged thee not in word or deed,"
40195,BOOK IV.,But by thy deadly dart I bleed.
40196,BOOK IV.,"What wilt thou, mid the virtuous, say"
40197,BOOK IV.,To purge thy lasting stain away?
40198,BOOK IV.,"All these, O King, must sink to hell,"
40199,BOOK IV.,"The regicide, the infidel,"
40200,BOOK IV.,"He who in blood and slaughter joys,"
40201,BOOK IV.,"A Bráhman or a cow destroys,"
40202,BOOK IV.,Untimely weds in law's despite
40203,BOOK IV.,"Scorning an elder brother's right,(590)"

40205,BOOK IV.,"The miser, spy, and treacherous friend."
40206,BOOK IV.,"These impious wretches, one and all,"
40207,BOOK IV.,Must to the hell of sinners fall.
40208,BOOK IV.,"My skin the holy may not wear,"
40209,BOOK IV.,Useless to thee my bones and hair;
40210,BOOK IV.,Nor may my slaughtered body be
40211,BOOK IV.,The food of devotees like thee.
40212,BOOK IV.,These five-toed things a man may slay
40213,BOOK IV.,And feed upon the fallen prey;
40214,BOOK IV.,"The mailed rhinoceros may die,"
40215,BOOK IV.,"And, with the hare his food supply."
40216,BOOK IV.,"Iguanas he may kill and eat,"
40217,BOOK IV.,With porcupine and tortoise meat.(591)
40218,BOOK IV.,But all the wise account it sin
40219,BOOK IV.,To touch my bones and hair and skin.
40220,BOOK IV.,My flesh they may not eat; and I
40221,BOOK IV.,"A useless prey, O Ráma, die."
40222,BOOK IV.,"In vain my Tárá reasoned well,"
40223,BOOK IV.,On dull deaf ears her counsel fell.
40224,BOOK IV.,"I scorned her words though sooth and sweet,"
40225,BOOK IV.,And hither rushed my fate to meet.
40226,BOOK IV.,Ah for the land thou rulest! she
40227,BOOK IV.,"Finds no protection, lord, from thee,"
40228,BOOK IV.,Neglected like some noble dame
40229,BOOK IV.,By a vile husband dead to shame.
40230,BOOK IV.,"Mean-hearted coward, false and vile,"
40231,BOOK IV.,"Whose cruel soul delights in guile,"
40232,BOOK IV.,"Could Dasaratha, noblest king,"
40233,BOOK IV.,Beget so mean and base a thing?
40234,BOOK IV.,"Alas! an elephant, in form"
40235,BOOK IV.,"Of Ráma, in a maddening storm"
40236,BOOK IV.,Of passion casting to the ground
40237,BOOK IV.,"The girth of law(592) that clipped him round,"
40238,BOOK IV.,Too wildly passionate to feel
40239,BOOK IV.,"The prick of duty's guiding steel,(593)"
40240,BOOK IV.,"Has charged me unawares, and dead"
40241,BOOK IV.,I fall beneath his murderous tread.
40242,BOOK IV.,"How, stained with this my base defeat,"
40243,BOOK IV.,"How wilt thou dare, where good men meet,"
40244,BOOK IV.,"To speak, when every tongue will blame"
40245,BOOK IV.,With keen reproach this deed of shame?
40246,BOOK IV.,"Such hero strength and valour, shown"
40247,BOOK IV.,"Upon the innocent alone,"
40248,BOOK IV.,Thou hast not proved in manly strife
40249,BOOK IV.,On him who robbed thee of thy wife.
40250,BOOK IV.,Hadst thou but fought in open field
40251,BOOK IV.,"And met me boldly unconcealed,"
40252,BOOK IV.,"This day had been thy fate to fall,"
40253,BOOK IV.,"Slain by this hand, to Yáma's hall."
40254,BOOK IV.,"In vain I strove, and struck by thee"
40255,BOOK IV.,Fell by a hand I could not see.
40256,BOOK IV.,"Thus bites a snake, for sins of yore,"
40257,BOOK IV.,A sleeping man who wakes no more.
40258,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva's foeman thou hast killed,"
40259,BOOK IV.,And thus his heart's desire fulfilled;
40260,BOOK IV.,"But, Ráma, hadst thou sought me first,"
40261,BOOK IV.,"And told the hope thy soul has nursed,"
40262,BOOK IV.,That very day had I restored
40263,BOOK IV.,The Maithil lady to her lord;
40264,BOOK IV.,"And, binding Rávan with a chain,"
40265,BOOK IV.,Had laid him at thy feet unslain.
40266,BOOK IV.,"Yea, were she sunk in deepest hell,"
40267,BOOK IV.,"Or whelmed beneath the ocean's swell,"
40268,BOOK IV.,I would have followed on her track
40269,BOOK IV.,"And brought the rescued lady back,"
40270,BOOK IV.,As Hayagríva(594) once set free
40271,BOOK IV.,From hell the white Asvatarí.(595)
40272,BOOK IV.,That when my spirit wings its flight
40273,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva reign, is just and right."
40274,BOOK IV.,"But most unjust, O King, that I,"
40275,BOOK IV.,"Slain by thy treacherous hand, should lie."
40276,BOOK IV.,"Be still, my heart: this earthly state"

40284,BOOK IV.,Canto XVIII. Ráma's Reply.
40285,BOOK IV.,
40286,BOOK IV.,
40287,BOOK IV.,He ceased: and Ráma's heart was stirred
40288,BOOK IV.,At every keen reproach he heard.
40289,BOOK IV.,"There Báli lay, a dim dark sun,"
40290,BOOK IV.,His course of light and glory run:
40291,BOOK IV.,Or like the bed of Ocean dried
40292,BOOK IV.,"Of his broad floods from side to side,"
40293,BOOK IV.,"Or helpless, as the dying fire,"
40294,BOOK IV.,Hushed his last words of righteous ire.
40295,BOOK IV.,"Then Ráma, with his spirit moved,"
40296,BOOK IV.,The Vánar king in turn reproved:
40297,BOOK IV.,"""Why dost thou, Báli, thus revile,"
40298,BOOK IV.,And castest not a glance the while
40299,BOOK IV.,"On claims of duty, love, and gain,"
40300,BOOK IV.,And customs o'er the world that reign?
40301,BOOK IV.,"Why dost thou blame me, rash and blind,"
40302,BOOK IV.,"Fickle as all thy Vánar kind,"
40303,BOOK IV.,Slighting each rule of ancient days
40304,BOOK IV.,Which all the good and prudent praise?
40305,BOOK IV.,"This land, each hill and woody chase,"
40306,BOOK IV.,Belongs to old Ikshváku's race:
40307,BOOK IV.,"With bird and beast and man, the whole"
40308,BOOK IV.,Is ours to cherish and control.
40309,BOOK IV.,"Now Bharat, prompt at duty's call,"
40310,BOOK IV.,"Wise, just, and true, is lord of all."
40311,BOOK IV.,"Each claim of law, love, gain he knows,"
40312,BOOK IV.,And wrath and favour duly shows.
40313,BOOK IV.,"A king from truth who never bends,"
40314,BOOK IV.,And grace with vigour wisely blends;
40315,BOOK IV.,"With valour worthy of his race,"
40316,BOOK IV.,He knows the claims of time and place.
40317,BOOK IV.,"Now we and other kings of might,"
40318,BOOK IV.,"By his ensample taught aright,"
40319,BOOK IV.,The lands of every region tread
40320,BOOK IV.,That justice may increase and spread.
40321,BOOK IV.,"While royal Bharat, wise and just,"
40322,BOOK IV.,"Rules the broad earth, his glorious trust,"
40323,BOOK IV.,"Who shall attempt, while he is lord,"
40324,BOOK IV.,A deed by Justice held abhorred?
40325,BOOK IV.,"We now, as Bharat has decreed,"
40326,BOOK IV.,"Let justice guide our every deed,"
40327,BOOK IV.,And toil each sinner to repress
40328,BOOK IV.,Who scorns the way of righteousness.
40329,BOOK IV.,"Thou from that path hast turned aside,"
40330,BOOK IV.,"And virtue's holy law defied,"
40331,BOOK IV.,"Left the fair path which kings should tread,"
40332,BOOK IV.,And followed pleasure's voice instead.
40333,BOOK IV.,The man who cleaves to duty's law
40334,BOOK IV.,Regards these three with filial awe--
40335,BOOK IV.,"The sire, the elder brother, third"
40336,BOOK IV.,Him from whose lips his lore he heard.
40337,BOOK IV.,"Thus too, for duty's sake, the wise"
40338,BOOK IV.,Regard with fond paternal eyes
40339,BOOK IV.,"The well-loved younger brother, one"
40340,BOOK IV.,"Their lore has ripened, and a son."
40341,BOOK IV.,"Fine are the laws which guide the good,"
40342,BOOK IV.,"Abstruse, and hardly understood;"
40343,BOOK IV.,"Only the soul, enthroned within"
40344,BOOK IV.,"The breast of each, knows right from sin."
40345,BOOK IV.,"But thou art wild and weak of soul,"
40346,BOOK IV.,"And spurnest, like thy race, control;"
40347,BOOK IV.,"The true and right thou canst not find,"
40348,BOOK IV.,The blind consulting with the blind.
40349,BOOK IV.,Incline thine ear and I will teach
40350,BOOK IV.,The cause that prompts my present speech.
40351,BOOK IV.,"This tempest of thy soul assuage,"
40352,BOOK IV.,Nor blame me in thine idle rage.
40353,BOOK IV.,"On this great sin thy thoughts bestow,"
40354,BOOK IV.,The sin for which I lay thee low.
40355,BOOK IV.,"Thou, Báli, in thy brother's life"
40356,BOOK IV.,"Hast robbed him of his wedded wife,"
40357,BOOK IV.,"And keepest, scorning ancient right,"
40358,BOOK IV.,His Rumá for thine own delight.
40359,BOOK IV.,Thy son's own wife should scarcely be
40360,BOOK IV.,More sacred in thine eyes than she.
40361,BOOK IV.,"All duty thou hast scorned, and hence"
40362,BOOK IV.,Comes punishment for dire offence.
40363,BOOK IV.,For those who blindly do amiss
40364,BOOK IV.,"There is, I ween, no way but this:"
40365,BOOK IV.,To check the rash who dare to stray
40366,BOOK IV.,"From customs which the good obey,"
40367,BOOK IV.,"I may not, sprung of Kshatriya line,"
40368,BOOK IV.,Forgive this heinous sin of thine:
40369,BOOK IV.,The laws for those who sin like thee
40370,BOOK IV.,The penalty of death decree.
40371,BOOK IV.,"Now Bharat rules with sovereign sway,"
40372,BOOK IV.,And we his royal word obey.
40373,BOOK IV.,"There was no hope of pardon, none,"
40374,BOOK IV.,"For the vile deed that thou hast done,"
40375,BOOK IV.,That wisest monarch dooms to die
40376,BOOK IV.,The wretch whose crimes the law defy;
40377,BOOK IV.,"And we, chastising those who err,"
40378,BOOK IV.,His righteous doom administer.
40379,BOOK IV.,My soul accounts Sugríva dear
40380,BOOK IV.,E'en as my brother Lakshman here.
40381,BOOK IV.,"He brings me blessing, and I swore"
40382,BOOK IV.,His wife and kingdom to restore:
40383,BOOK IV.,A bond in solemn honour bound
40384,BOOK IV.,When Vánar chieftains stood around.
40385,BOOK IV.,And can a king like me forsake
40386,BOOK IV.,"His friend, and plighted promise break?"
40387,BOOK IV.,"Reflect, O Vánar, on the cause,"
40388,BOOK IV.,"The sanction of eternal laws,"
40389,BOOK IV.,"And, justly smitten down, confess"
40390,BOOK IV.,Thou diest for thy wickedness.
40391,BOOK IV.,By honour was I bound to lend
40392,BOOK IV.,Assistance to a faithful friend;
40393,BOOK IV.,And thou hast met a righteous fate
40394,BOOK IV.,Thy former sins to expiate.
40395,BOOK IV.,And thus wilt thou some merit win
40396,BOOK IV.,And make atonement for thy sin.
40397,BOOK IV.,"For hear me, Vánar King, rehearse"
40398,BOOK IV.,"What Manu(597) spake in ancient verse,--"
40399,BOOK IV.,"This holy law, which all accept"

40401,BOOK IV.,"""Pure grow the sinners kings chastise,"
40402,BOOK IV.,"And, like the virtuous, gain the skies;"
40403,BOOK IV.,"By pain or full atonement freed,"
40404,BOOK IV.,"They reap the fruit of righteous deed,"
40405,BOOK IV.,While kings who punish not incur
40406,BOOK IV.,"The penalties of those who err."""
40407,BOOK IV.,"Mándhátá(598) once, a noble king,"
40408,BOOK IV.,"Light of the line from which I spring,"
40409,BOOK IV.,Punished with death a devotee
40410,BOOK IV.,When he had stooped to sin like thee;
40411,BOOK IV.,And many a king in ancient time
40412,BOOK IV.,"Has punished frantic sinners' crime,"
40413,BOOK IV.,"And, when their impious blood was spilt,"
40414,BOOK IV.,Has washed away the stain of guilt.
40415,BOOK IV.,"Cease, Báli, cease: no more complain:"
40416,BOOK IV.,"Reproaches and laments are vain,"
40417,BOOK IV.,For thou art justly punished: we
40418,BOOK IV.,Obey our king and are not free.
40419,BOOK IV.,"Once more, O Báli, lend thine ear"
40420,BOOK IV.,Another weightiest plea to hear.
40421,BOOK IV.,"For this, when heard and pondered well,"
40422,BOOK IV.,Will all complaint and rage dispel.
40423,BOOK IV.,"My soul will ne'er this deed repent,"
40424,BOOK IV.,Nor was my shaft in anger sent.
40425,BOOK IV.,We take the silvan tribes beset
40426,BOOK IV.,"With snare and trap and gin and net,"
40427,BOOK IV.,And many a heedless deer we smite
40428,BOOK IV.,"From thickest shade, concealed from sight."
40429,BOOK IV.,"Wild for the slaughter of the game,"
40430,BOOK IV.,At stately stags our shafts we aim.
40431,BOOK IV.,"We strike them bounding scared away,"
40432,BOOK IV.,"We strike them as they stand at bay,"
40433,BOOK IV.,"When careless in the shade they lie,"
40434,BOOK IV.,Or scan the plain with watchful eye.
40435,BOOK IV.,"They turn away their heads; we aim,"
40436,BOOK IV.,And none the eager hunter blame.
40437,BOOK IV.,"Each royal saint, well trained in law"
40438,BOOK IV.,"Of duty, loves his bow to draw"

40443,BOOK IV.,"But yet, O best of Vánars, know"
40444,BOOK IV.,That kings who rule the earth bestow
40445,BOOK IV.,"Fruit of pure life and virtuous deed,"
40446,BOOK IV.,And lofty duty's hard-won meed.
40447,BOOK IV.,Harm not thy lord the king: abstain
40448,BOOK IV.,From act and word that cause him pain;
40449,BOOK IV.,For kings are children of the skies
40450,BOOK IV.,Who walk this earth in men's disguise.
40451,BOOK IV.,"But thou, in duty's claims untaught,"
40452,BOOK IV.,"Thy breast with blinding passion fraught,"
40453,BOOK IV.,Assailest me who still have clung
40454,BOOK IV.,"To duty, with thy bitter tongue."""
40455,BOOK IV.,
40456,BOOK IV.,He ceased: and Báli sore distressed
40457,BOOK IV.,"The sovereign claims of law confessed,"
40458,BOOK IV.,"And freed, o'erwhelmed with woe and shame,"
40459,BOOK IV.,The lord of Raghu's race from blame.
40460,BOOK IV.,"Then, reverent palm to palm applied,"
40461,BOOK IV.,To Ráma thus the Vánar cried:
40462,BOOK IV.,"""True, best of men, is every word"
40463,BOOK IV.,"That from thy lips these ears have heard,"
40464,BOOK IV.,It ill beseems a wretch like me
40465,BOOK IV.,To bandy empty words with thee.
40466,BOOK IV.,Forgive the angry taunts that broke
40467,BOOK IV.,From my wild bosom as I spoke.
40468,BOOK IV.,"And lay not to my charge, O King,"
40469,BOOK IV.,My mad reproaches' idle sting.
40470,BOOK IV.,"Thou, in the truth by trial trained,"
40471,BOOK IV.,Best knowledge of the right hast gained:
40472,BOOK IV.,"And layest, just and pure within,"
40473,BOOK IV.,The meetest penalty on sin.
40474,BOOK IV.,"Through every bond of law I burst,"
40475,BOOK IV.,The boldest sinner and the worst.
40476,BOOK IV.,O let thy right-instructing speech
40477,BOOK IV.,"Console my heart and wisely teach."""
40478,BOOK IV.,
40479,BOOK IV.,Like some sad elephant who stands
40480,BOOK IV.,"Fast sinking in the treacherous sands,"
40481,BOOK IV.,Thus Báli raised despairing eyes;
40482,BOOK IV.,Then spake again with sobs and sighs:
40483,BOOK IV.,
40484,BOOK IV.,"""Not for myself, O King, I grieve,"
40485,BOOK IV.,"For Tárá or the friends I leave,"
40486,BOOK IV.,"As for sweet Angad, my dear son,"
40487,BOOK IV.,"My noble, only little one."
40488,BOOK IV.,"For, nursed in luxury and bliss,"
40489,BOOK IV.,"His father he will mourn and miss,"
40490,BOOK IV.,And like a stream whose fount is dry
40491,BOOK IV.,"Will waste away and sink and die,--"
40492,BOOK IV.,"My own dear child, my only boy,"
40493,BOOK IV.,His mother Tárá's hope and joy.
40494,BOOK IV.,"Spare him, O son of Raghu, spare"
40495,BOOK IV.,The child entrusted to thy care.
40496,BOOK IV.,My Angad and Sugríva treat
40497,BOOK IV.,"E'en as thy heart considers meet,"
40498,BOOK IV.,"For thou, O chief of men, art strong"
40499,BOOK IV.,To guard the right and punish wrong.
40500,BOOK IV.,"O, if thou wilt thine ear incline"
40501,BOOK IV.,"To hear these dying words of mine,"
40502,BOOK IV.,He and Sugríva will to thee
40503,BOOK IV.,As Bharat and as Lakshman be.
40504,BOOK IV.,"Let not my Tárá, left forlorn,"
40505,BOOK IV.,Weep for Sugríva's wrathful scorn;
40506,BOOK IV.,"Nor let him, for her lord's offence,"
40507,BOOK IV.,Condemn her faithful innocence.
40508,BOOK IV.,And well and wisely may he reign
40509,BOOK IV.,If thy dear grace his power sustain:
40510,BOOK IV.,"If, following thee his friend and guide,"
40511,BOOK IV.,He turn not from thy hest aside:
40512,BOOK IV.,"Thus may he reign with glory, nay"
40513,BOOK IV.,Thus to the skies will win his way.
40514,BOOK IV.,"Though stayed by Tárá's fond recall,"
40515,BOOK IV.,By thy dear hand I longed to fall.
40516,BOOK IV.,"Against my brother rushed and fought,"
40517,BOOK IV.,"And gained the death I long have sought."""
40518,BOOK IV.,
40519,BOOK IV.,Then Ráma thus the prince consoled
40520,BOOK IV.,From whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:
40521,BOOK IV.,"""Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,"
40522,BOOK IV.,"Nor tremble for thyself or us,"
40523,BOOK IV.,For we will deal with thine and thee
40524,BOOK IV.,As duty and the laws decree.
40525,BOOK IV.,"He who exacts and he who pays,"
40526,BOOK IV.,"Is justly slain or justly slays,"
40527,BOOK IV.,Shall in the life to come have bliss;
40528,BOOK IV.,For each has done his task in this.
40529,BOOK IV.,"Thou, wandering from the right, art made"
40530,BOOK IV.,Pure by the forfeit thou hast paid.
40531,BOOK IV.,"Thy weight of sins is cast aside,"
40532,BOOK IV.,And duty's claim is satisfied.
40533,BOOK IV.,"Then grieve no more, O Prince, but clear"
40534,BOOK IV.,"Thy bosom from all doubt and fear,"
40535,BOOK IV.,"For fate, inexorably stern,"
40536,BOOK IV.,Thou hast no power to move or turn.
40537,BOOK IV.,Thy princely Angad still will share
40538,BOOK IV.,"My tender love, Sugríva's care;"
40539,BOOK IV.,And to thy offspring shall be shown
40540,BOOK IV.,"Affection that shall match thine own."""

40546,BOOK IV.,
40547,BOOK IV.,
40548,BOOK IV.,No answer gave the Vánar king
40549,BOOK IV.,To Ráma's prudent counselling.
40550,BOOK IV.,"Battered and bruised by tree and stone,"
40551,BOOK IV.,"By Ráma's arrow overthrown,"
40552,BOOK IV.,"Fainting upon the ground he lay,"
40553,BOOK IV.,Gasping his troubled life away.
40554,BOOK IV.,
40555,BOOK IV.,But Tárá in the Vánar's hall
40556,BOOK IV.,Heard tidings of her husband's fall;
40557,BOOK IV.,Heard that a shaft from Ráma's bow
40558,BOOK IV.,Had laid the royal Báli low.
40559,BOOK IV.,"Her darling Angad by her side,"
40560,BOOK IV.,Distracted from her home she hied.
40561,BOOK IV.,Then nigh the place of battle drew
40562,BOOK IV.,"The Vánars, Angad's retinue."
40563,BOOK IV.,They saw the bow-armed Ráma: dread
40564,BOOK IV.,"Fell on them, and they turned and fled."
40565,BOOK IV.,"Like helpless deer, their leaders slain,"
40566,BOOK IV.,So wildly fled the startled train.
40567,BOOK IV.,"But Tárá saw, and nearer pressed,"
40568,BOOK IV.,And thus the flying band addressed:
40569,BOOK IV.,"""O Vánars, ye who ever stand"
40570,BOOK IV.,"About our king, a trusty band,"
40571,BOOK IV.,Where is the lion master? why
40572,BOOK IV.,Forsake ye thus your lord and fly?
40573,BOOK IV.,"Say, lies he dead upon the plain,"
40574,BOOK IV.,"A brother by a brother slain,"
40575,BOOK IV.,Or pierced by shafts from Ráma's bow
40576,BOOK IV.,"That rain from far upon the foe?"""
40577,BOOK IV.,
40578,BOOK IV.,"Thus Tárá questioned, and was still:"
40579,BOOK IV.,"Then, wearers of each shape at will,"
40580,BOOK IV.,The Vánars thus with one accord
40581,BOOK IV.,Answered the Lady of their lord:
40582,BOOK IV.,"""Turn, Tárá turn, and half undone"
40583,BOOK IV.,Save Angad thy beloved son.
40584,BOOK IV.,"There Ráma stands in death's disguise,"
40585,BOOK IV.,And conquered Báli faints and dies.
40586,BOOK IV.,"He by whose strong arm, thick and fast,"
40587,BOOK IV.,"Uprooted trees and rocks were cast,"
40588,BOOK IV.,Lies smitten by a shaft that came
40589,BOOK IV.,Resistless as the lightning flame.
40590,BOOK IV.,"When he, whose splendour once could vie"
40591,BOOK IV.,"With Indra's, regent of the sky,"
40592,BOOK IV.,"Fell by that deadly arrow, all"
40593,BOOK IV.,The Vánars fled who marked his fall.
40594,BOOK IV.,"Let all our chiefs their succours bring,"
40595,BOOK IV.,And Angad be anointed king;
40596,BOOK IV.,For all who come of Vánar race
40597,BOOK IV.,Will serve him set in Báli's place.
40598,BOOK IV.,Or else our conquering foes to-day
40599,BOOK IV.,"Within our wall will force their way,"
40600,BOOK IV.,Polluting with their hostile feet
40601,BOOK IV.,The chambers of thy loved retreat.
40602,BOOK IV.,"Great fear is on us, all and one."
40603,BOOK IV.,"Those who have wives and who have none,"
40604,BOOK IV.,"They lust for power, are fierce and bold,"
40605,BOOK IV.,"Or hate us for the strife of old."""
40606,BOOK IV.,
40607,BOOK IV.,"She heard their speech as, sore afraid,"
40608,BOOK IV.,"Arrested in their flight, they stayed,"
40609,BOOK IV.,And gave her answer as became
40610,BOOK IV.,The spirit of so true a dame:
40611,BOOK IV.,"""Nay, what have I to do with pelf,"
40612,BOOK IV.,"With son, with kingdom, or with self,"
40613,BOOK IV.,"When he, my noble lord, who leads"
40614,BOOK IV.,"The Vánars like a lion, bleeds?"
40615,BOOK IV.,"His high-souled victor will I meet,"
40616,BOOK IV.,"And throw me prostrate at his feet."""
40617,BOOK IV.,
40618,BOOK IV.,"She hastened forth, her bosom rent"
40619,BOOK IV.,"With anguish, weeping as she went,"
40620,BOOK IV.,"And striking, mastered by her woes,"
40621,BOOK IV.,Her head and breast with frantic blows.
40622,BOOK IV.,She hurried to the field and found
40623,BOOK IV.,"Her husband prostrate on the ground,"
40624,BOOK IV.,"Who quelled the hostile Vánars' might,"
40625,BOOK IV.,Whose bank was never turned in flight:
40626,BOOK IV.,Whose arm a massy rock could throw
40627,BOOK IV.,As Indra hurls his bolts below:
40628,BOOK IV.,"Fierce as the rushing tempest, loud"
40629,BOOK IV.,As thunder from a labouring cloud:
40630,BOOK IV.,Whene'er he roared his voice of fear
40631,BOOK IV.,Struck terror on the boldest ear:
40632,BOOK IV.,"Now slain, as, hungry for the prey,"
40633,BOOK IV.,A tiger might a lion slay:
40634,BOOK IV.,"Or when, his serpent foe to seek,"
40635,BOOK IV.,Suparna(600) with his furious beak
40636,BOOK IV.,"Tears up a sacred hillock, long"
40637,BOOK IV.,"The reverence of a village throng,"
40638,BOOK IV.,"Its altar with their offerings spread,"
40639,BOOK IV.,And the gay flag that waved o'erhead.
40640,BOOK IV.,She looked and saw the victor stand
40641,BOOK IV.,Resting upon his bow his hand:
40642,BOOK IV.,"And fierce Sugríva she descried,"
40643,BOOK IV.,And Lakshman by his brother's side.
40644,BOOK IV.,"She passed them by, nor stayed to view,"
40645,BOOK IV.,Swift to her husband's side she flew;
40646,BOOK IV.,"Then as she looked, her strength gave way,"
40647,BOOK IV.,And in the dust she fell and lay.
40648,BOOK IV.,"Then, as if startled ere the close"
40649,BOOK IV.,"Of slumber, from the earth she rose."
40650,BOOK IV.,"Upon her dying husband, round"
40651,BOOK IV.,"Whose soul the coils of Death were wound,"
40652,BOOK IV.,Her eyes in agony she bent
40653,BOOK IV.,And called him with a shrill lament.
40654,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, when he heard her cries,"
40655,BOOK IV.,"And saw the queen with weeping eyes,"
40656,BOOK IV.,"And youthful Angad standing there,"
40657,BOOK IV.,His load of grief could hardly bear.

40666,BOOK IV.,Her arms about her husband wound.
40667,BOOK IV.,"Sobbed on his breast, and sick and faint"
40668,BOOK IV.,With anguish poured her wild complaint:
40669,BOOK IV.,"""Brave in the charge of battle, boast"
40670,BOOK IV.,"And glory of the Vánar host,"
40671,BOOK IV.,Why on the cold earth wilt thou lie
40672,BOOK IV.,And give no answer when I cry?
40673,BOOK IV.,"Up, warrior, from thy lowly bed!"
40674,BOOK IV.,A meeter couch for thee is spread.
40675,BOOK IV.,It ill beseems a glorious king
40676,BOOK IV.,On the bare ground his limbs to fling.
40677,BOOK IV.,"Ah, surely must thy love be strong"
40678,BOOK IV.,"For her whom thou hast governed long,"
40679,BOOK IV.,"If thou, my hero, canst recline"

40681,BOOK IV.,"Or, famed for justice through the land,"
40682,BOOK IV.,Thou on the road to heaven hast planned
40683,BOOK IV.,Some city fairer far than this
40684,BOOK IV.,To be thy new metropolis.
40685,BOOK IV.,"Are all our pleasures ended now,"
40686,BOOK IV.,With those delicious hours which thou
40687,BOOK IV.,"And I, dear lord, together spent"
40688,BOOK IV.,In woods that breathed the honey's scent?
40689,BOOK IV.,"Whelmed in my sorrow's boundless sea,"
40690,BOOK IV.,"There is no joy, no hope, for me,"
40691,BOOK IV.,"When my beloved lord, who led"
40692,BOOK IV.,"The Vánars to the fight, is dead,"
40693,BOOK IV.,My widowed heart is stern and cold.
40694,BOOK IV.,"Or, at the sight mine eyes behold,"
40695,BOOK IV.,O'ermastered would it end this ache
40696,BOOK IV.,And in a thousand fragments break.
40697,BOOK IV.,"Ah noble Vánar, doomed to pay"
40698,BOOK IV.,The penalty of all today--
40699,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva from his home expelled,"
40700,BOOK IV.,And Rumá(601) from his arms withheld.
40701,BOOK IV.,"Our Vánar race and thee to save,"
40702,BOOK IV.,Wise counsel for thy weal I gave;
40703,BOOK IV.,"But thou, by wildest folly stirred,"
40704,BOOK IV.,"Wouldst give no credence to my word,"
40705,BOOK IV.,"And now wilt woo the nymphs above,"
40706,BOOK IV.,And shake their souls with pangs of love.
40707,BOOK IV.,"Ah, never could it be that thou"
40708,BOOK IV.,"Beneath Sugríva's power shouldst bow,"
40709,BOOK IV.,Thy conqueror is none but Fate
40710,BOOK IV.,Whose mandates all who breathe await.
40711,BOOK IV.,And does no thrill of anguish run
40712,BOOK IV.,"Through the stern breast of Raghu's son,"
40713,BOOK IV.,"Whose base hand dealt a coward's blow,"
40714,BOOK IV.,And smote thee fighting with thy foe?
40715,BOOK IV.,"Reft of my lord my days, alas!"
40716,BOOK IV.,In bitter bitter woe will pass:
40717,BOOK IV.,"And I, long blest with every good,"
40718,BOOK IV.,Must bear my dreary widowhood.
40719,BOOK IV.,"And when his uncle's brow is stern,"
40720,BOOK IV.,"When his fierce eyes with fury burn,"
40721,BOOK IV.,"Ah, what will be my Angad's fate,"
40722,BOOK IV.,So fair and young and delicate?
40723,BOOK IV.,"Come, darling, for the last sad sight,"
40724,BOOK IV.,Of thy dear sire who loved the right;
40725,BOOK IV.,For soon thine eyes will long in vain
40726,BOOK IV.,A look at that loved face to gain.
40727,BOOK IV.,"And, hero, as thy child draws near,"
40728,BOOK IV.,With tender words his spirit cheer;
40729,BOOK IV.,"Thy dying wishes gently speak,"

40737,BOOK IV.,"Enjoy uninterrupted reign,"
40738,BOOK IV.,"For he, thy foe, at length is slain."
40739,BOOK IV.,"Dost thou not hear me speak, and why"
40740,BOOK IV.,Hast thou no word of soft reply?
40741,BOOK IV.,Will thou not lift thine eyes and see
40742,BOOK IV.,"These dames who look to none but thee?"""
40743,BOOK IV.,
40744,BOOK IV.,"From their sad eyes, as Tárá spoke,"
40745,BOOK IV.,The floods of bitter sorrow broke:
40746,BOOK IV.,"Then, pressing close to Angad's side,"
40747,BOOK IV.,Each lifted up her voice and cried:
40748,BOOK IV.,
40749,BOOK IV.,"""How couldst thou leave thine Angad thus,"
40750,BOOK IV.,"And go, for ever go, from us--"
40751,BOOK IV.,"Thy child so dear in brave attire,"
40752,BOOK IV.,Graced with the virtues of his sire?
40753,BOOK IV.,"If e'er in want of thought, O chief,"

40755,BOOK IV.,"Forgive my folly, I entreat,"
40756,BOOK IV.,"And with my head I touch thy feet."""
40757,BOOK IV.,
40758,BOOK IV.,Again the hapless Tárá wept
40759,BOOK IV.,"As to her husband's side she crept,"

40770,BOOK IV.,Fell by her lord's half lifeless frame;
40771,BOOK IV.,"And Hanumán drew softly near,"
40772,BOOK IV.,And strove her grieving heart to cheer:
40773,BOOK IV.,
40774,BOOK IV.,"""By changeless law our bliss and woe"
40775,BOOK IV.,From ancient worth and folly flow.
40776,BOOK IV.,"What fruits soe'er we cull, the seeds"
40777,BOOK IV.,Were scattered by our former deeds.(602)
40778,BOOK IV.,"Why mourn another's mournful fate,"
40779,BOOK IV.,"And weep, thyself unfortunate?"
40780,BOOK IV.,"Be calm, O thou whose heart is wise,"
40781,BOOK IV.,For none deserves another's sighs.
40782,BOOK IV.,"Look up, with idle sorrow strive:"
40783,BOOK IV.,"Thy child, his heir, is yet alive."
40784,BOOK IV.,"Let needful rites be duly done,"

40786,BOOK IV.,Regard the law which all obey:
40787,BOOK IV.,"They spring to life, they pass away."
40788,BOOK IV.,"Begin the task that bids thee rise,"
40789,BOOK IV.,"And stay these tears, for thou art wise."
40790,BOOK IV.,"Our lord the king is doomed to die,"
40791,BOOK IV.,On whom ten million hearts rely.
40792,BOOK IV.,"Kind, liberal, patient, true, and just"
40793,BOOK IV.,"Was he in whom they place their trust,"
40794,BOOK IV.,And now he seeks the land of those

40800,BOOK IV.,These twain(603) whose hearts with sorrow ache
40801,BOOK IV.,"The funeral rites shall undertake,"
40802,BOOK IV.,And Angad by his mother's care
40803,BOOK IV.,"Be king, his father's rightful heir."
40804,BOOK IV.,"Now let him pay, as laws require,"
40805,BOOK IV.,"His sacred duty to his sire,"
40806,BOOK IV.,Nor one solemnity omit
40807,BOOK IV.,Of all that mighty kings befit.
40808,BOOK IV.,And when thy fond eye sees thine own

40835,BOOK IV.,
40836,BOOK IV.,
40837,BOOK IV.,There breathing still with slow faint sighs
40838,BOOK IV.,"Lay Báli on the ground: his eyes,"
40839,BOOK IV.,"Damp with the tears of death, he raised,"
40840,BOOK IV.,"On conquering Sugríva gazed,"
40841,BOOK IV.,And then in clearest speech expressed
40842,BOOK IV.,The tender feelings of his breast:
40843,BOOK IV.,"""Not to my charge, Sugríva, lay"
40844,BOOK IV.,Thine injuries avenged to-day;
40845,BOOK IV.,But rather blame resistless Fate
40846,BOOK IV.,That urged me on infuriate.
40847,BOOK IV.,Fate ne'er agreed our lives to bless
40848,BOOK IV.,With simultaneous happiness:
40849,BOOK IV.,To dwell like brothers side by side
40850,BOOK IV.,In tender love was still denied.
40851,BOOK IV.,The Vánars' realm is thine to-day:
40852,BOOK IV.,"Begin, O King, thy rightful sway;(604)"
40853,BOOK IV.,For I must go at Yáma's call
40854,BOOK IV.,To sojourn in his gloomy hall;
40855,BOOK IV.,Must part and leave this very hour
40856,BOOK IV.,"My life, my realm, my kingly power,"
40857,BOOK IV.,And go instead of these to gain
40858,BOOK IV.,Bright glory free from spot and stain.
40859,BOOK IV.,Now at thy hands one boon I seek
40860,BOOK IV.,"With the last words my lips shall speak,"
40861,BOOK IV.,"And, though it be no easy thing,"
40862,BOOK IV.,"Perform the task I give thee, King."
40863,BOOK IV.,"This son of mine, no foolish boy,"
40864,BOOK IV.,"Worthy of bliss and nursed in joy,--"
40865,BOOK IV.,"See, prostrate on the ground he lies,"

40867,BOOK IV.,"The child I love so well, more sweet"

40869,BOOK IV.,To him be kindly favour shown:
40870,BOOK IV.,O guard and keep him as thine own.
40871,BOOK IV.,"Retain him ever by thy side,"
40872,BOOK IV.,"His father, helper, friend, and guide."
40873,BOOK IV.,"From fear and woe his young life save,"
40874,BOOK IV.,And give him all his father gave.
40875,BOOK IV.,Then Tárá's son in time shall be
40876,BOOK IV.,"Brave, resolute, and famed like thee,"
40877,BOOK IV.,And march before thee to the fight
40878,BOOK IV.,Where stricken fiends shall own his might.
40879,BOOK IV.,"While yet a tender stripling, fame"
40880,BOOK IV.,"Shall bruit abroad his warrior name,"
40881,BOOK IV.,And brightly shall his glory shine
40882,BOOK IV.,For exploits worthy of his line.
40883,BOOK IV.,"Child of Sushen,(605) my Tárá well"

40888,BOOK IV.,Do boldly what her lips advise;
40889,BOOK IV.,"For things to come her eye can see,"
40890,BOOK IV.,And with her words events agree.
40891,BOOK IV.,And for the son of Raghu's sake
40892,BOOK IV.,The toil and danger undertake:
40893,BOOK IV.,"For breach of faith were grievous wrong,"
40894,BOOK IV.,Nor wouldst thou be unpunished long.
40895,BOOK IV.,"Now, brother, take this chain of gold,"

40899,BOOK IV.,
40900,BOOK IV.,"The loving speech Sugríva heard,"
40901,BOOK IV.,And all his heart with woe was stirred.
40902,BOOK IV.,Remorse and gentle pity stole
40903,BOOK IV.,Each thought of triumph from his soul:
40904,BOOK IV.,Thus fades the light when Ráhu(606) mars
40905,BOOK IV.,The glory of the Lord of Stars.(607)
40906,BOOK IV.,All angry thoughts were stayed and stilled
40907,BOOK IV.,And kindly love his bosom filled.
40908,BOOK IV.,His brother's word the chief obeyed
40909,BOOK IV.,And took the chain as Báli prayed.
40910,BOOK IV.,On little Angad standing nigh
40911,BOOK IV.,"The dying hero fixed his eye,"
40912,BOOK IV.,"And, ready from this world to part,"
40913,BOOK IV.,Spoke the fond utterance of his heart:
40914,BOOK IV.,
40915,BOOK IV.,"""Let time and place thy thoughts employ:"
40916,BOOK IV.,"In woe be strong, be meek in joy."
40917,BOOK IV.,"Accept both pain and pleasure, still"
40918,BOOK IV.,Obedient to Sugríva's will.
40919,BOOK IV.,"Thou hast, my darling, from the first"
40920,BOOK IV.,With tender care been softly nursed;
40921,BOOK IV.,"But harder days, if thou wouldst win"
40922,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva's love, must now begin."
40923,BOOK IV.,"To those who hate him ne'er incline,"
40924,BOOK IV.,Nor count his foe a friend of thine.
40925,BOOK IV.,"In all thy thoughts his welfare seek,"
40926,BOOK IV.,"Obedient, lowly, faithful, meek."
40927,BOOK IV.,"Let no rash suit his bosom pain,"
40928,BOOK IV.,Nor yet from due requests abstain.(608)
40929,BOOK IV.,"Each is a grievous fault, between"
40930,BOOK IV.,"The two is found the happy mean."""
40931,BOOK IV.,
40932,BOOK IV.,Then Báli ceased: his eyeballs rolled
40933,BOOK IV.,In stress of anguish uncontrolled
40934,BOOK IV.,"His massive teeth were bared to view,"
40935,BOOK IV.,And from the frame the spirit flew.
40936,BOOK IV.,"Their lord and leader dead, the crowd"
40937,BOOK IV.,Of noblest Vánars shrieked aloud:
40938,BOOK IV.,"""Since thou, O King, hast sought the skies"

40940,BOOK IV.,"Her woods, where Vánars loved to rove,"
40941,BOOK IV.,"Are empty now, and hill and grove."
40942,BOOK IV.,"From every eye the light is fled,"
40943,BOOK IV.,"Since thou, our mighty lord, art dead."
40944,BOOK IV.,Thine was the unwearied arm that bore
40945,BOOK IV.,The brunt of deadly fight of yore
40946,BOOK IV.,"With Golabh the Gandharva, when,"
40947,BOOK IV.,"Lasting through five long years and ten,"
40948,BOOK IV.,The dreadful conflict knew no stay
40949,BOOK IV.,"In gloom of night, in glare of day;"
40950,BOOK IV.,And when the fifteenth year had past
40951,BOOK IV.,Thy dire opponent fell at last.
40952,BOOK IV.,If such a foeman fell beneath

40963,BOOK IV.,And hapless Tárá sank below
40964,BOOK IV.,"The whelming waters of her woe,"
40965,BOOK IV.,Looked upon Báli's face and fell
40966,BOOK IV.,"Beside him whom she loved go well,"

40985,BOOK IV.,To thee the earth is dearer far
40986,BOOK IV.,"Than I and my caresses are,"
40987,BOOK IV.,"If thou upon her breast wilt lie,"

40990,BOOK IV.,"Bold to attack and strong to save,"
40991,BOOK IV.,"Fate is Sugríva's thrall, and we"
40992,BOOK IV.,In him our lord and master see.
40993,BOOK IV.,"Lo, by thy bed, a mournful band,"
40994,BOOK IV.,Thy Vánar chiefs lamenting stand.
40995,BOOK IV.,"O hear thy nobles' groans and cries,"
40996,BOOK IV.,"O mark thy Angad's weeping eyes,"
40997,BOOK IV.,"O list to my entreaties, break"
40998,BOOK IV.,The chains of slumber and awake.
40999,BOOK IV.,"Ah me, my lord, this lowly bed"
41000,BOOK IV.,"Where rest thy limbs and fallen head,"
41001,BOOK IV.,Is the cold couch where smitten lay
41002,BOOK IV.,Thy foemen in the bloody fray.
41003,BOOK IV.,"O noble heart from blemish free,"
41004,BOOK IV.,"Lover of war, beloved by me."
41005,BOOK IV.,Why hast thou fled away and left
41006,BOOK IV.,Thy Tárá of all hope bereft?
41007,BOOK IV.,Unwise the father who allows
41008,BOOK IV.,"His child to be a warrior's spouse,"
41009,BOOK IV.,"For, hero, see thy consort's fate,"
41010,BOOK IV.,"A widow now most desolate,"
41011,BOOK IV.,"For ever broken is my pride,"
41012,BOOK IV.,"My hope of lasting bliss has died,"
41013,BOOK IV.,And sinking in the lowest deep
41014,BOOK IV.,Of sorrow's sea I pine and weep.
41015,BOOK IV.,"Ah, surely not of earthly mould,"
41016,BOOK IV.,"This stony heart is stern and cold,"
41017,BOOK IV.,"Or, in a hundred pieces rent,"
41018,BOOK IV.,It had not lingered to lament.
41019,BOOK IV.,"Dead, dead! my husband, friend, and lord"
41020,BOOK IV.,"In whom my loving hopes were stored,"
41021,BOOK IV.,"First in the field, his foemen's dread,"
41022,BOOK IV.,"My own victorious Báli, dead!"
41023,BOOK IV.,"A woman when her lord has died,"
41024,BOOK IV.,"Though children flourish by her side,"
41025,BOOK IV.,"Though stores of gold her coffers fill,"
41026,BOOK IV.,Is called a lonely widow still.
41027,BOOK IV.,"Alas, thy bleeding gashes make"
41028,BOOK IV.,Around thy limbs a purple lake:
41029,BOOK IV.,Thus slumbering was thy wont to lie
41030,BOOK IV.,On cushions bright with crimson dye.
41031,BOOK IV.,Dark streams of welling blood besmear
41032,BOOK IV.,"Thy limbs where dust and mire adhere,"
41033,BOOK IV.,"Nor have I strength, weighed down by woe,"
41034,BOOK IV.,Mine arms about thy form to throw.
41035,BOOK IV.,The issue of this day has brought
41036,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva all his wishes sought,"
41037,BOOK IV.,For Ráma shot one shaft and he
41038,BOOK IV.,Is freed from fear and jeopardy.
41039,BOOK IV.,"Alas, alas, I may not rest"
41040,BOOK IV.,"My head upon thy wounded breast,"
41041,BOOK IV.,Obstructed by the massive dart
41042,BOOK IV.,"Deep buried in thy bleeding heart."""
41043,BOOK IV.,
41044,BOOK IV.,Then Níla from his bosom drew
41045,BOOK IV.,"The fatal shaft that pierced him through,"
41046,BOOK IV.,Like some tremendous serpent deep
41047,BOOK IV.,In caverns of a hill asleep.
41048,BOOK IV.,"As from the hero's wound it came,"
41049,BOOK IV.,"Shot from the shaft a gleam of flame,"
41050,BOOK IV.,Like the last flashes of the sun
41051,BOOK IV.,Descending when his course is run.
41052,BOOK IV.,From the wide rent in crimson flood
41053,BOOK IV.,"Rushed the full stream of Báli's blood,"
41054,BOOK IV.,Like torrents down a mountain's side
41055,BOOK IV.,With golden ore and copper dyed.
41056,BOOK IV.,Then Tárá brushed with tender care
41057,BOOK IV.,"The dust of battle from his hair,"
41058,BOOK IV.,While her sad eyes poured down their rain
41059,BOOK IV.,Upon her lord untimely slain.
41060,BOOK IV.,Once more she looked upon the dead;
41061,BOOK IV.,Then to her bright-eyed child she said:
41062,BOOK IV.,"""Turn hither, turn thy weeping eyes"
41063,BOOK IV.,Where low in death thy father lies.
41064,BOOK IV.,By sinful deed and bitter hate
41065,BOOK IV.,Our lord has met his mournful fate.
41066,BOOK IV.,Bright as the sun at early morn
41067,BOOK IV.,To Yáma's halls is Báli borne.
41068,BOOK IV.,"Then go, my child, salute the king,"
41069,BOOK IV.,"From whom our bliss and honour spring."""
41070,BOOK IV.,
41071,BOOK IV.,Obedient to his mother's hest
41072,BOOK IV.,His father's feet he gently pressed
41073,BOOK IV.,With twining arms and lingering hands:
41074,BOOK IV.,"""Father,"" he cried, ""here Angad stands."""
41075,BOOK IV.,
41076,BOOK IV.,"Then Tárá: ""Art thou stern and mute,"
41077,BOOK IV.,Regardless of thy child's salute?
41078,BOOK IV.,"Hast thou no blessing for thy son,"
41079,BOOK IV.,"No word for little Angad, none?"
41080,BOOK IV.,"O, hero, at thy lifeless feet"
41081,BOOK IV.,"Here with my boy I take my seat,"
41082,BOOK IV.,"As some sad mother of the herd,"
41083,BOOK IV.,"By the fierce lion undeterred,"
41084,BOOK IV.,Lies moaning by the grassy dell
41085,BOOK IV.,Wherein her lord and leader fell.
41086,BOOK IV.,"How, having wrought that awful rite,"
41087,BOOK IV.,"The sacrifice of deadly fight,"
41088,BOOK IV.,Wherein the shaft by Ráma sped
41089,BOOK IV.,"Supplied the place of water shed,"
41090,BOOK IV.,How hast thou bathed thee at the end
41091,BOOK IV.,Without thy wife her aid to lend?(609)
41092,BOOK IV.,Why do mine eyes no more behold
41093,BOOK IV.,"Thy bright beloved chain of gold,"
41094,BOOK IV.,"Which, pleased with thee, the Immortals' King"
41095,BOOK IV.,About thy neck vouchsafed to fling?
41096,BOOK IV.,Still lingering on thy lifeless face
41097,BOOK IV.,I see the pride of royal race:
41098,BOOK IV.,"Thus when the sun has set, his glow"
41099,BOOK IV.,Still rests upon the Lord of Snow.
41100,BOOK IV.,Alas my hero! undeterred
41101,BOOK IV.,Thou wouldst not listen to my word.
41102,BOOK IV.,With tears and prayers I sued in vain:
41103,BOOK IV.,"Thou wouldst not listen, and art slain."

41113,BOOK IV.,But when Sugríva saw her weep
41114,BOOK IV.,"O'erwhelmed in sorrow's rushing deep,"
41115,BOOK IV.,Swift through his bosom pierced the sting
41116,BOOK IV.,Of anguish for the fallen king.
41117,BOOK IV.,At the sad sight his eyes beheld
41118,BOOK IV.,"A flood of bitter tears outwelled,"
41119,BOOK IV.,"And, with his bosom racked and rent,"
41120,BOOK IV.,To Ráma with his train he went.
41121,BOOK IV.,He came with faltering steps and slow
41122,BOOK IV.,Where Ráma held his mighty bow
41123,BOOK IV.,"And arrow like a venomed snake,"
41124,BOOK IV.,And to the son of Raghu spake:
41125,BOOK IV.,"""Well hast thou kept, O King, thy vow:"
41126,BOOK IV.,The promised fruit is gathered now.
41127,BOOK IV.,"But life is marred, my soul to-day"

41131,BOOK IV.,"And Angad weeps his father slain,"
41132,BOOK IV.,How can my heart delight to reign?
41133,BOOK IV.,"For outrage, fury, senseless pride,"
41134,BOOK IV.,"My brother, doomed of yore, has died."
41135,BOOK IV.,"Yet, Raghu's son, in bitter woe"
41136,BOOK IV.,I mourn his fated overthrow.
41137,BOOK IV.,"Ah, better far in pain and ill"

41141,BOOK IV.,"Did not he cry,--great-hearted foe,--"
41142,BOOK IV.,"""Go, for I will not slay thee, Go""?"
41143,BOOK IV.,With his brave soul those words agree:
41144,BOOK IV.,"My speech, my deeds, are worthy me."
41145,BOOK IV.,How can a brother counterweigh
41146,BOOK IV.,"His grievous loss with joys of sway,"
41147,BOOK IV.,And see with dull unpitying eye
41148,BOOK IV.,So brave and good a brother die?
41149,BOOK IV.,His lofty soul was nobly blind:
41150,BOOK IV.,"My death alas, he ne'er designed;"
41151,BOOK IV.,"But I, urged blindly on by hate,"
41152,BOOK IV.,Sought with his life my rage to sate.
41153,BOOK IV.,He smote me with a splintered tree:
41154,BOOK IV.,"I groaned aloud and turned to flee,"
41155,BOOK IV.,"From stern reproaches he forbore,"
41156,BOOK IV.,And gently bade me sin no more.
41157,BOOK IV.,Serene and dutiful and good
41158,BOOK IV.,He kept the laws of brotherhood:
41159,BOOK IV.,"I, fierce and greedy, vengeful, base,"
41160,BOOK IV.,Showed all the vices of our race.
41161,BOOK IV.,"Ah me, dear friend, my brother's fate"
41162,BOOK IV.,Lays on my soul a crushing weight:
41163,BOOK IV.,"A sin no heart should e'er conceive,"
41164,BOOK IV.,But at the thought each soul should grieve:
41165,BOOK IV.,Sin such as Indra's when his blow
41166,BOOK IV.,Laid heavenly Visvarúpa(610) low.
41167,BOOK IV.,"Yet earth, the waters of the seas,"
41168,BOOK IV.,The race of women and the trees
41169,BOOK IV.,Were fain upon themselves to take
41170,BOOK IV.,The weight of sin for Indra's sake.

41213,BOOK IV.,Fate ne'er exceeds the rule of Fate:
41214,BOOK IV.,"Is ne'er too swift, is ne'er too late,"

41216,BOOK IV.,"Forgets no life, nor passes by."

41398,BOOK IV.,His rank and power and royal sway.
41399,BOOK IV.,"He now will call each faithful friend,"
41400,BOOK IV.,"Enter the city, and attend"
41401,BOOK IV.,With sage advice and prudent care
41402,BOOK IV.,To every task that waits him there.
41403,BOOK IV.,Then balm and unguent shall anoint
41404,BOOK IV.,"Our monarch, as the laws appoint,"
41405,BOOK IV.,And gems and precious wreaths shall be
41406,BOOK IV.,"His grateful offering, King, to thee."
41407,BOOK IV.,"Do thou, O Ráma, with thy friend"
41408,BOOK IV.,Thy steps within the city bend;
41409,BOOK IV.,"Our ruler on his throne install,"
41410,BOOK IV.,"And with thy presence cheer us all."""
41411,BOOK IV.,
41412,BOOK IV.,"Then, skilled in lore and arts that guide"
41413,BOOK IV.,"The speaker, Raghu's son replied:"
41414,BOOK IV.,"""For fourteen years I might not break"
41415,BOOK IV.,The mandate that my father spake;
41416,BOOK IV.,"Nor can I, till that time be fled,"
41417,BOOK IV.,The street of town or village tread.
41418,BOOK IV.,Let King Sugríva seek the town
41419,BOOK IV.,"Most worthy of her high renown,"
41420,BOOK IV.,There let him be without delay
41421,BOOK IV.,"Anointed, and begin his sway."""
41422,BOOK IV.,
41423,BOOK IV.,"This answered, to Sugríva then"
41424,BOOK IV.,Thus spake anew the king of men:
41425,BOOK IV.,"""Do thou who knowest right ordain"
41426,BOOK IV.,Prince Angad consort of thy reign;
41427,BOOK IV.,"For he is noble, true, and bold,"
41428,BOOK IV.,And trained a righteous course to hold
41429,BOOK IV.,Gifts like his sire's that youth adorn
41430,BOOK IV.,Born eldest to the eldest born.
41431,BOOK IV.,"This is the month of Srávan,(612) first"
41432,BOOK IV.,Of those that see the rain-clouds burst.
41433,BOOK IV.,"Four months, thou knowest well, extends"
41434,BOOK IV.,The season when the rain descends.
41435,BOOK IV.,No time for deeds of war is this:
41436,BOOK IV.,"Seek thou thy fair metropolis,"
41437,BOOK IV.,"And I with Lakshman, O my friend,"
41438,BOOK IV.,The time upon this hill will spend.
41439,BOOK IV.,An ample cavern opens there
41440,BOOK IV.,"Made lovely by the mountain air,"
41441,BOOK IV.,And lotuses and lilies fill
41442,BOOK IV.,The pleasant lake and murmuring rill.
41443,BOOK IV.,"When Kártik's(613) month shall clear the skies,"
41444,BOOK IV.,Then tempt the mighty enterprise.
41445,BOOK IV.,"Now, chieftain to thy home repair,"
41446,BOOK IV.,"And be anointed sovereign there."""
41447,BOOK IV.,
41448,BOOK IV.,Sugríva heard: he bowed his head:
41449,BOOK IV.,Within the lovely town he sped
41450,BOOK IV.,"Which Báli's royal will had swayed,"
41451,BOOK IV.,Where thousand Vánar chiefs arrayed
41452,BOOK IV.,"Gathered in order round their king,"
41453,BOOK IV.,And led him on with welcoming.
41454,BOOK IV.,Low on the earth the lesser crowd
41455,BOOK IV.,Fell in prostration as they bowed.
41456,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva looked with grateful eyes,"
41457,BOOK IV.,Spake to them all and bade them rise.
41458,BOOK IV.,Then through the royal bowers he strode
41459,BOOK IV.,Wherein the monarch's wives abode.
41460,BOOK IV.,Soon from the inner chambers came
41461,BOOK IV.,The Vánar of exalted fame;
41462,BOOK IV.,And joyful friends drew near and shed
41463,BOOK IV.,"King-making balm upon his head,"
41464,BOOK IV.,Like Gods anointing in the skies
41465,BOOK IV.,Their sovereign of the thousand eyes.(614)
41466,BOOK IV.,"Then brought they, o'er their king to hold"
41467,BOOK IV.,"The white umbrella decked with gold,"
41468,BOOK IV.,And chouries with their waving hair
41469,BOOK IV.,In golden handles wondrous fair;
41470,BOOK IV.,"And fragrant herbs and seed and spice,"
41471,BOOK IV.,"And sparkling gems exceeding price,"
41472,BOOK IV.,"And every bloom from woods and leas,"
41473,BOOK IV.,And gum distilled from milky trees;
41474,BOOK IV.,"And precious ointment white as milk,"
41475,BOOK IV.,"And spotless robes of cloth and silk,"
41476,BOOK IV.,Wreaths of sweet flowers whose glories gleam
41477,BOOK IV.,"In grassy grove, on lake or stream."
41478,BOOK IV.,And fragrant sandal and each scent
41479,BOOK IV.,That makes the soft breeze redolent;
41480,BOOK IV.,"Grain, honey, odorous seed, and store"
41481,BOOK IV.,Of oil and curd and golden ore;
41482,BOOK IV.,"A noble tiger's skin, a pair"
41483,BOOK IV.,"Of sandals wrought with costliest care,"
41484,BOOK IV.,Eight pairs of damsels drawing nigh
41485,BOOK IV.,Brought unguents stained with varied dye.
41486,BOOK IV.,Then gems and cates and robes displayed
41487,BOOK IV.,"Before the twice-born priests were laid,"
41488,BOOK IV.,That they would deign in order due
41489,BOOK IV.,To consecrate the king anew.
41490,BOOK IV.,The sacred grass was duly spread
41491,BOOK IV.,"And sacrificial flame was fed,"
41492,BOOK IV.,Which Scripture-learned priests supplied
41493,BOOK IV.,With oil which texts had sanctified.
41494,BOOK IV.,"Then, with all rites ordained of old,"
41495,BOOK IV.,"High on the terrace bright with gold,"
41496,BOOK IV.,"Whereon a glorious carpet lay,"
41497,BOOK IV.,"And fresh-culled garlands sweet and gay,"
41498,BOOK IV.,"Placed on his throne, Sugríva bent"
41499,BOOK IV.,His looks toward the Orient.
41500,BOOK IV.,"In horns from forehead of the bull,"
41501,BOOK IV.,"In pitchers bright and beautiful,"
41502,BOOK IV.,In urns of gold the Vánara took
41503,BOOK IV.,"Pure water brought from stream and brook,"
41504,BOOK IV.,From every consecrated strand
41505,BOOK IV.,And every sea that beats the land.
41506,BOOK IV.,"Then, as prescribed by sacred lore"
41507,BOOK IV.,"And many a mighty sage of yore,(615)"
41508,BOOK IV.,The leaders of the Vánars poured
41509,BOOK IV.,The sacred water on their lord.(616)
41510,BOOK IV.,From every Vánar at the close
41511,BOOK IV.,Of that imperial rite arose
41512,BOOK IV.,"Shouts of glad triumph, loud and long"
41513,BOOK IV.,Repeated by the high-souled throng.
41514,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, when the rite was done,"
41515,BOOK IV.,"Obeyed the hest of Raghu's son,"
41516,BOOK IV.,"Prince Angad to his breast he strained,"
41517,BOOK IV.,And partner of his sway ordained.
41518,BOOK IV.,Once more from all the host rang out
41519,BOOK IV.,The loud huzza and jovful shout.
41520,BOOK IV.,"""Well done! well done!"" each Vánar cried,"
41521,BOOK IV.,And good Sugríva glorified.
41522,BOOK IV.,Then with glad voices loudly raised
41523,BOOK IV.,Were Ráma and his brother praised;
41524,BOOK IV.,And bright Kishkindhá shone that day
41525,BOOK IV.,With happy throngs and banners gay.

41531,BOOK IV.,
41532,BOOK IV.,
41533,BOOK IV.,"But when the solemn rite was o'er,"
41534,BOOK IV.,"And bold Sugríva reigned once more,"
41535,BOOK IV.,"The sons of Raghu sought the hill,"
41536,BOOK IV.,"Prasravan of the rushing rill,"
41537,BOOK IV.,"Where roamed the tiger and the deer,"
41538,BOOK IV.,And lions raised their voice of fear;
41539,BOOK IV.,"Thick set with trees of every kind,"
41540,BOOK IV.,With trailing shrubs and plants entwined;
41541,BOOK IV.,"Home of the ape and monkey, lair"
41542,BOOK IV.,Of mountain cat and pard and bear.
41543,BOOK IV.,In cloudy gloom against the sky
41544,BOOK IV.,The sanctifying hills rose high.
41545,BOOK IV.,"Pierced in their crest, a spacious cave"
41546,BOOK IV.,To Raghu's sons a shelter gave.
41547,BOOK IV.,"Then Ráma, pure from every crime,"
41548,BOOK IV.,In words well suited to the time
41549,BOOK IV.,"To Lakshman spake, whose faithful zeal"
41550,BOOK IV.,Watched humbly for his brother's weal:
41551,BOOK IV.,"""I love this spacious cavern where"
41552,BOOK IV.,There breathes a fresh and pleasant air.
41553,BOOK IV.,"Brave brother, let us here remain"
41554,BOOK IV.,Throughout the season of the rain.
41555,BOOK IV.,For in mine eyes this mountain crest
41556,BOOK IV.,"Is above all, the loveliest."
41557,BOOK IV.,Where copper-hued and black and white
41558,BOOK IV.,Show the huge blocks that face the height;
41559,BOOK IV.,"Where gleams the shine of varied ore,"
41560,BOOK IV.,Where dark clouds hang and torrents roar;
41561,BOOK IV.,"Where waving woods are fair to see,"
41562,BOOK IV.,And creepers climb from tree to tree;
41563,BOOK IV.,"Where the gay peacock's voice is shrill,"
41564,BOOK IV.,And sweet birds carol on the hill;
41565,BOOK IV.,Where odorous breath is wafted far
41566,BOOK IV.,From Jessamine and Sinduvár;(617)
41567,BOOK IV.,And opening flowers of every hue
41568,BOOK IV.,Give wondrous beauty to the view.
41569,BOOK IV.,"See, too, this pleasant water near"
41570,BOOK IV.,Our cavern home is fresh and clear;
41571,BOOK IV.,And lilies gay with flower and bud
41572,BOOK IV.,Are glorious on the lovely flood.
41573,BOOK IV.,This cave that fares north and east
41574,BOOK IV.,Will shelter us till rain has ceased;
41575,BOOK IV.,And towering hills that rise behind
41576,BOOK IV.,Will screen us from the furious wind.
41577,BOOK IV.,Close by the cavern's portal lies
41578,BOOK IV.,And level stone of ample size
41579,BOOK IV.,"And sable hue, a mighty block"
41580,BOOK IV.,Long severed from the parent rock.
41581,BOOK IV.,Now let thine eye bent northward rest
41582,BOOK IV.,"A while upon that mountain crest,"
41583,BOOK IV.,"High as a cloud that brings the rain,"
41584,BOOK IV.,And dark as iron rent in twain.
41585,BOOK IV.,"Look southward, brother, now and view"
41586,BOOK IV.,A cloudy pile of paler hue
41587,BOOK IV.,Like Mount Kailása's topmost height
41588,BOOK IV.,Where ores of every tint are bright.
41589,BOOK IV.,"See, Lakshman, see before our cave"
41590,BOOK IV.,That clear brook eastward roll its wave
41591,BOOK IV.,As though 'twere Gangá's infant rill
41592,BOOK IV.,Down streaming from the three-peaked hill.
41593,BOOK IV.,"See, by the water's gentle flow"
41594,BOOK IV.,"Asoka, sál, and sandal grow."
41595,BOOK IV.,And every lovely tree most fair
41596,BOOK IV.,With leaf and bud and flower is there.
41597,BOOK IV.,"See there, beneath the bending trees"
41598,BOOK IV.,"That fringe her bank, the river flees,"
41599,BOOK IV.,Clothed with their beauty like a maid
41600,BOOK IV.,"In all her robes and gems arrayed,"
41601,BOOK IV.,While from the sedgy banks are heard
41602,BOOK IV.,The soft notes of each amorous bird.
41603,BOOK IV.,O see what lovely islets stud
41604,BOOK IV.,"Like gems the bosom of the flood,"
41605,BOOK IV.,And sárases and wild swans crowd
41606,BOOK IV.,About her till she laughs aloud.
41607,BOOK IV.,"See, lotus blooms the brook o'erspread,"
41608,BOOK IV.,"Some tender blue, some dazzling red,"
41609,BOOK IV.,And opening lilies white as snow
41610,BOOK IV.,Their buds in rich profusion show.
41611,BOOK IV.,"There rings the joyous peacock's scream,"
41612,BOOK IV.,"There stands the curlew by the stream,"
41613,BOOK IV.,And holy hermits love to throng
41614,BOOK IV.,Where the sweet waters speed along.
41615,BOOK IV.,Ranged on the grassy margin shine
41616,BOOK IV.,"Gay sandal trees in glittering line,"
41617,BOOK IV.,And all the wondrous verdure seems
41618,BOOK IV.,The offspring of creative dreams.
41619,BOOK IV.,"O conquering Prince, there cannot be"
41620,BOOK IV.,A lovelier place than this we see.
41621,BOOK IV.,Here sheltered on the beauteous height
41622,BOOK IV.,Our days will pass in calm delight.
41623,BOOK IV.,"Nor is Kishkindhá's city, gay"
41624,BOOK IV.,"With grove and garden, far away."
41625,BOOK IV.,Thence will the breeze of evening bring
41626,BOOK IV.,Sweet music as the minstrels sing;
41627,BOOK IV.,"And, when the Vánars dance, will come"
41628,BOOK IV.,The sound of tabour and of drum.
41629,BOOK IV.,"Again to spouse and realm restored,"
41630,BOOK IV.,"Girt by his friends, the Vánar lord"
41631,BOOK IV.,Great glory has acquired; and how
41632,BOOK IV.,"Can he be less than happy now?"""

41635,BOOK IV.,His dwelling in that pleasant shade
41636,BOOK IV.,Upon the mountain's shelving side
41637,BOOK IV.,That sweetly all his wants supplied.
41638,BOOK IV.,But still the hero's troubled mind
41639,BOOK IV.,"No comfort in his woe could find,"
41640,BOOK IV.,Yet mourning for his stolen wife
41641,BOOK IV.,"Dearer to Ráma than his life,"
41642,BOOK IV.,Chief when he saw the Lord of Night
41643,BOOK IV.,"Rise slowly o'er the eastern height,"
41644,BOOK IV.,He tossed upon his leafy bed
41645,BOOK IV.,With eyes by sleep unvisited.
41646,BOOK IV.,"Outwelled the tears in ceaseless flow,"
41647,BOOK IV.,And every sense was numbed by woe.
41648,BOOK IV.,Each pang that pierced the mourner through
41649,BOOK IV.,"Smote Lakshman's faithful bosom too,"
41650,BOOK IV.,"Who, troubled for his brother's sake,"
41651,BOOK IV.,With wisest words the prince bespake:
41652,BOOK IV.,"""Arise, my brother, and be strong:"
41653,BOOK IV.,Thy hero heart has mourned too long.
41654,BOOK IV.,Thou knowest well that tears and sighs
41655,BOOK IV.,Will mar the mightiest enterprise.
41656,BOOK IV.,Thine was the soul that loved to dare:
41657,BOOK IV.,To serve the Gods was still thy care;
41658,BOOK IV.,And ne'er may sorrow's sting subdue
41659,BOOK IV.,A heart so resolute and true.
41660,BOOK IV.,How canst thou hope to slay in fight
41661,BOOK IV.,The giant cruel in his might?
41662,BOOK IV.,Unwearied must the champion be
41663,BOOK IV.,Who strives with such a foe as he.
41664,BOOK IV.,Tear out this sorrow by the root;
41665,BOOK IV.,Again be bold and resolute.
41666,BOOK IV.,"Arise, my brother, and subdue"
41667,BOOK IV.,The demon and his wicked crew.
41668,BOOK IV.,"Thou canst destroy the earth, her seas,"
41669,BOOK IV.,Her rooted hills and giant trees
41670,BOOK IV.,Unseated by thy furious hand:
41671,BOOK IV.,And shall one fiend thy power withstand?
41672,BOOK IV.,Wait through this season of the rain
41673,BOOK IV.,"Till suns of autumn dry the plain,"
41674,BOOK IV.,"Then shall thy giant foe, and all"
41675,BOOK IV.,"His host and realm, before thee fall."
41676,BOOK IV.,I wake thy valour that has slept
41677,BOOK IV.,Amid the tears thine eyes have wept;
41678,BOOK IV.,As drops of oil in worship raise
41679,BOOK IV.,"The dormant flame to sudden blaze."""
41680,BOOK IV.,
41681,BOOK IV.,The son of Raghu heard: he knew
41682,BOOK IV.,His brother's rede was wise and true;
41683,BOOK IV.,"And, honouring his friendly guide,"
41684,BOOK IV.,In gentle words he thus replied:
41685,BOOK IV.,"""Whate'er a hero firm and bold,"
41686,BOOK IV.,"Devoted, true, and lofty-souled"
41687,BOOK IV.,"Should speak by deep affection led,"
41688,BOOK IV.,Such are the words which thou hast said.
41689,BOOK IV.,I cast away each pensive thought
41690,BOOK IV.,"That brings the noblest plans to naught,"
41691,BOOK IV.,And each uninjured power will strain
41692,BOOK IV.,Until the purposed end we gain.
41693,BOOK IV.,"Thy prudent words will I obey,"
41694,BOOK IV.,"And till the close of rain-time stay,"
41695,BOOK IV.,When King Sugríva will invite
41696,BOOK IV.,"To action, and the streams be bright."
41697,BOOK IV.,The hero saved in hour of need

41723,BOOK IV.,"With bleeding wounds incarnadined,"

41728,BOOK IV.,"See, by the fervent heat embrowned,"
41729,BOOK IV.,"How drenched with recent showers, the ground"
41730,BOOK IV.,"Pours out in floods her gushing tears,"
41731,BOOK IV.,Like Sítá wild with torturing fears.
41732,BOOK IV.,So softly blows this cloud-born breeze
41733,BOOK IV.,Cool through the boughs of camphor trees

41738,BOOK IV.,Shows like Sugríva when they shed
41739,BOOK IV.,Tne royal balm upon his head.
41740,BOOK IV.,Like students at their task appear
41741,BOOK IV.,These hills whose misty peaks are near:
41742,BOOK IV.,Black deerskin(619) garments wrought of cloud
41743,BOOK IV.,"Their forms with fitting mantles shroud,"
41744,BOOK IV.,Each torrent from the summit poured
41745,BOOK IV.,Supplies the place of sacred cord.(620)
41746,BOOK IV.,And winds that in their caverns moan
41747,BOOK IV.,Sound like the voice's undertone.(621)

41765,BOOK IV.,The parting sun has ceased to glow.
41766,BOOK IV.,"No captain now for conquest burns,"
41767,BOOK IV.,But homeward with his host returns;
41768,BOOK IV.,For roads and kings' ambitious dreams
41769,BOOK IV.,Have vanished neath descending streams.

41780,BOOK IV.,In this sweet time of ease and rest
41781,BOOK IV.,"No care disturbs Sugríva's breast,"
41782,BOOK IV.,"The foe that marred his peace o'erthrown,"
41783,BOOK IV.,And queen and realm once more his own.
41784,BOOK IV.,"Alas, a harder fate is mine,"
41785,BOOK IV.,"Reft both of realm and queen to pine,"
41786,BOOK IV.,"And, like the bank which floods erode,"

41788,BOOK IV.,"Sore on my soul my miseries weigh,"

41816,BOOK IV.,No cloudlet marred the blue on high.
41817,BOOK IV.,"The Saras(630) missed the welcome rain,"
41818,BOOK IV.,The moon's full beams were bright again.
41819,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, lapped in bliss, forgot"
41820,BOOK IV.,"The claims of faith, or heeded not;"
41821,BOOK IV.,And by alluring joys misled
41822,BOOK IV.,The path of falsehood learned to tread.
41823,BOOK IV.,"In careless ease he passed each hour,"
41824,BOOK IV.,And dallied in his lady's bower.
41825,BOOK IV.,"Each longing of his heart was stilled,"
41826,BOOK IV.,And every lofty hope fulfilled.
41827,BOOK IV.,"With royal Rumá by his side,"
41828,BOOK IV.,"Or Tárá yet a dearer bride,"
41829,BOOK IV.,He spent each joyous day and night
41830,BOOK IV.,"In revelry and wild delight,"
41831,BOOK IV.,Like Indra whom the nymphs entice
41832,BOOK IV.,To taste the joys of Paradise.
41833,BOOK IV.,"The power to courtiers' hands resigned,"
41834,BOOK IV.,To all their acts his eyes were blind.
41835,BOOK IV.,"All doubt, all fear he cast aside"
41836,BOOK IV.,And lived with pleasure for his guide.
41837,BOOK IV.,"But sage Hanúmán, firm and true,"
41838,BOOK IV.,"Whose heart the lore of Scripture knew,"

41844,BOOK IV.,"Of eloquence that wins the heart,"
41845,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva from his trance to wake,"
41846,BOOK IV.,His salutary counsel spake:
41847,BOOK IV.,
41848,BOOK IV.,"""The realm is won, thy name advanced,"
41849,BOOK IV.,"The glory of thy house enhanced,"
41850,BOOK IV.,And now thy foremost care should be
41851,BOOK IV.,To aid the friends who succoured thee.
41852,BOOK IV.,He who is firm and faithful found
41853,BOOK IV.,"To friendly ties in honour bound,"
41854,BOOK IV.,Will see his name and fame increase
41855,BOOK IV.,And his blest kingdom thrive in peace.
41856,BOOK IV.,Wide sway is his who truly boasts
41857,BOOK IV.,"That friends and treasure, self and hosts,"
41858,BOOK IV.,"All blent in one harmonious whole,"
41859,BOOK IV.,Are subject to his firm control.
41860,BOOK IV.,"Do thou, whose footsteps never stray"
41861,BOOK IV.,"From the clear bounds of duty's way,"
41862,BOOK IV.,"Assist, as honour bids thee, now"
41863,BOOK IV.,"Thy friends, observant of thy vow."
41864,BOOK IV.,"For if all cares we lay not by,"
41865,BOOK IV.,"And to our friend's assistance fly,"
41866,BOOK IV.,"We, after, toil in idle haste,"
41867,BOOK IV.,And all the late endeavour waste.
41868,BOOK IV.,Up! nor the promised help delay
41869,BOOK IV.,Until the hour have slipped away.
41870,BOOK IV.,Up! and with Raghu's son renew
41871,BOOK IV.,The search for Sítá lost to view.
41872,BOOK IV.,"The hour is come: he hears the call,"
41873,BOOK IV.,But not on thee reproaches fall

41875,BOOK IV.,His eager spirit's restlessness.
41876,BOOK IV.,Long joined to thee in friendly ties
41877,BOOK IV.,"He made thy fame and fortune rise,"
41878,BOOK IV.,In gentle gifts by none excelled.
41879,BOOK IV.,In splendid might unparalleled.
41880,BOOK IV.,"Up, to his succour, King! repay"
41881,BOOK IV.,"The favour of that prosperous day,"

41884,BOOK IV.,The cry for help thou wilt not spurn

41887,BOOK IV.,To him who realm and life restored?
41888,BOOK IV.,"Exert thy power, and thou hast won"
41889,BOOK IV.,The love of Dasaratha's son:
41890,BOOK IV.,"And wilt thou for his summons wait,"
41891,BOOK IV.,"And, till he call thee, hesitate?"
41892,BOOK IV.,Think not the hero needs thy power
41893,BOOK IV.,To save him in the desperate hour:
41894,BOOK IV.,He with his arrows could subdue
41895,BOOK IV.,"The Gods and all the demon crew,"
41896,BOOK IV.,And only waits that he may see
41897,BOOK IV.,Redeemed the promise made by thee.
41898,BOOK IV.,"For thee he risked his life and fought,"
41899,BOOK IV.,For thee that great deliverance wrought.

41901,BOOK IV.,His lady wheresoe'er she lies.

41936,BOOK IV.,But Ráma in the autumn night
41937,BOOK IV.,"Stood musing on the mountain height,"
41938,BOOK IV.,While grief and love that scorned control
41939,BOOK IV.,Shook with wild storms the hero's soul.
41940,BOOK IV.,"Clear was the sky, without a cloud"
41941,BOOK IV.,The glory of the moon to shroud.
41942,BOOK IV.,And bright with purest silver shone
41943,BOOK IV.,Each hill the soft beams looked upon.
41944,BOOK IV.,He knew Sugríva's heart was bent
41945,BOOK IV.,"On pleasure, gay and negligent."
41946,BOOK IV.,He thought on Janak's child forlorn
41947,BOOK IV.,From his fond arms for ever torn.
41948,BOOK IV.,"He mourned occasion slipping by,"
41949,BOOK IV.,And faint with anguish heaved each sigh.
41950,BOOK IV.,He sat where many a varied streak
41951,BOOK IV.,Of rich ore marked the mountain peak.
41952,BOOK IV.,"He raised his eyes the sky to view,"
41953,BOOK IV.,And to his love his sad thoughts flew.
41954,BOOK IV.,"He heard the Sáras cry, and faint"
41955,BOOK IV.,With sorrow poured his love-born plaint:
41956,BOOK IV.,"""She, she who mocked the softest tone"
41957,BOOK IV.,"Of wild birds' voices with her own,--"
41958,BOOK IV.,"Where strays she now, my love who played"
41959,BOOK IV.,So happy in our hermit shade?
41960,BOOK IV.,How can my absent love behold
41961,BOOK IV.,"The bright trees with their flowers of gold,"
41962,BOOK IV.,And all their gleaming glory see
41963,BOOK IV.,With eyes that vainly look for me?
41964,BOOK IV.,How is it with my darling when
41965,BOOK IV.,From the deep tangles of the glen
41966,BOOK IV.,Float carols of each bird elate
41967,BOOK IV.,With rapture singing to his mate?
41968,BOOK IV.,In vain my weary glances rove
41969,BOOK IV.,"From lake to hill, from stream to grove:"
41970,BOOK IV.,"I find no rapture in the scene,"
41971,BOOK IV.,And languish for my fawn-eyed queen.
41972,BOOK IV.,"Ah, does strong love with wild unrest,"
41973,BOOK IV.,"Born of the autumn, stir her breast?"
41974,BOOK IV.,And does the gentle lady pine
41975,BOOK IV.,"Till her bright eyes shall look in mine?"""
41976,BOOK IV.,
41977,BOOK IV.,"Thus Raghu's son in piteous tone,"
41978,BOOK IV.,"O'erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan."
41979,BOOK IV.,E'en as the bird that drinks the rains(632)
41980,BOOK IV.,To Indra thousand-eyed complains.
41981,BOOK IV.,Then Lakshman who had wandered through
41982,BOOK IV.,"The copses where the berries grew,"
41983,BOOK IV.,Returning to the cavern found
41984,BOOK IV.,"His brother chief in sorrow drowned,"
41985,BOOK IV.,And pitying the woes that broke
41986,BOOK IV.,The spirit of the hero spoke:
41987,BOOK IV.,
41988,BOOK IV.,"""Why cast thy strength of soul away,"
41989,BOOK IV.,And weakly yield to passion's sway?
41990,BOOK IV.,"Arise, my brother, do and dare"
41991,BOOK IV.,Ere action perish in despair.
41992,BOOK IV.,"Recall the firmness of thy heart,"
41993,BOOK IV.,And nerve thee for a hero's part.
41994,BOOK IV.,Whose is the hand unscathed to sieze
41995,BOOK IV.,The red flame quickened by the breeze?
41996,BOOK IV.,Where is the foe will dare to wrong
41997,BOOK IV.,"Or keep the Maithil lady long?"""
41998,BOOK IV.,Then with pale lips that sorrow dried
41999,BOOK IV.,The son of Raghu thus replied:

42001,BOOK IV.,"The sweet rain from the firmament,"
42002,BOOK IV.,"Sees the rich promise of the grain,"
42003,BOOK IV.,And turns him to his rest again.
42004,BOOK IV.,"The clouds with voices loud and deep,"
42005,BOOK IV.,"Veiling each tree upon the steep,"
42006,BOOK IV.,Up on the thirsty earth have shed
42007,BOOK IV.,Their precious burden and are fled.
42008,BOOK IV.,Now in kings' hearts ambition glows:
42009,BOOK IV.,They rush to battle with their foes;(633)
42010,BOOK IV.,But in Sugríva's sloth I see
42011,BOOK IV.,No care for deeds of chivalry.
42012,BOOK IV.,"See, Lakshman, on each breezy height"
42013,BOOK IV.,A thousand autumn blooms are bright.
42014,BOOK IV.,See how the wings of wild swans gleam
42015,BOOK IV.,On every islet of the stream.
42016,BOOK IV.,Four months of flood and rain are past:
42017,BOOK IV.,A hundred years they seemed to last
42018,BOOK IV.,"To me whom toil and trouble tried,"
42019,BOOK IV.,My Sítá severed from my side.
42020,BOOK IV.,"She, gentlest woman, weak and young,"
42021,BOOK IV.,Still to her lord unwearied clung.
42022,BOOK IV.,Still by the exile's side she stood
42023,BOOK IV.,"In the wild ways of Dandak wood,"
42024,BOOK IV.,Like a fond bird disconsolate
42025,BOOK IV.,If parted from her darling mate.
42026,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, lapped in soft repose,"
42027,BOOK IV.,"Untouched by pity for my woes,"
42028,BOOK IV.,"Scorns the poor exile, dispossessed,"
42029,BOOK IV.,"By Rávan's mightier arm oppressed,"
42030,BOOK IV.,The wretch who comes to sue and pray
42031,BOOK IV.,From his lost kingdom far away.
42032,BOOK IV.,"Hence falls on me the Vánar's scorn,"
42033,BOOK IV.,A suitor friendless and forlorn.
42034,BOOK IV.,The time is come: with heedless eye
42035,BOOK IV.,"He sees the hour of action fly,--"
42036,BOOK IV.,"Unmindful, now his hopes succeed,"
42037,BOOK IV.,Of promise made in stress of need.
42038,BOOK IV.,"Go seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,"
42039,BOOK IV.,"Forgetful of his royal oath,"
42040,BOOK IV.,And as mine envoy thus upbraid
42041,BOOK IV.,The monarch for his help delayed:
42042,BOOK IV.,"""Vile is the wretch who will not pay"
42043,BOOK IV.,"The favour of an earlier day,"
42044,BOOK IV.,"Hope in the supplicant's breast awakes,"
42045,BOOK IV.,And then his plighted promise breaks.
42046,BOOK IV.,"Noblest, mid all of women born,"
42047,BOOK IV.,"Who keeps the words his lips have sworn,"
42048,BOOK IV.,"Yea, if those words be good or ill,"
42049,BOOK IV.,Maintains his faith unbroken still.
42050,BOOK IV.,The thankless who forget to aid
42051,BOOK IV.,"The friend who helped them when they prayed,"
42052,BOOK IV.,"Dishonoured in their death shall lie,"
42053,BOOK IV.,And dogs shall pass their corpses by.
42054,BOOK IV.,Sure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold
42055,BOOK IV.,"My bow of battle backed with gold,"
42056,BOOK IV.,Wouldst gaze upon its awful form
42057,BOOK IV.,"Like lightning flashing through the storm,"
42058,BOOK IV.,And hear the clanging bowstring loud
42059,BOOK IV.,"As thunder from a labouring cloud."""
42060,BOOK IV.,
42061,BOOK IV.,His valour and his strength I know:
42062,BOOK IV.,"But pleasure's sway now sinks them low,"
42063,BOOK IV.,"With thee, my brother, for ally"
42064,BOOK IV.,That strength and valour I defy.
42065,BOOK IV.,"He promised, when the rains should end,"
42066,BOOK IV.,The succour of his arm to lend.
42067,BOOK IV.,"Those months are past: he dares forget,"
42068,BOOK IV.,"And, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet."
42069,BOOK IV.,No thought disturbs his careless breast
42070,BOOK IV.,"For us impatient and distressed,"
42071,BOOK IV.,"And, while we sadly wait and pine,"
42072,BOOK IV.,Girt by his lords he quaffs the wine.
42073,BOOK IV.,"Go, brother, go, his palace seek,"
42074,BOOK IV.,"And boldly to Sugríva speak,"
42075,BOOK IV.,Thus give the listless king to know
42076,BOOK IV.,What waits him if my anger glow:
42077,BOOK IV.,"Still open, to the gloomy God,"

42079,BOOK IV.,"""Still to thy plighted word be true,"

42081,BOOK IV.,I launched the shaft I pointed well.
42082,BOOK IV.,"And Báli, only Báli, fell."
42083,BOOK IV.,"But, if from truth thou dare to stray,"

42126,BOOK IV.,"With gentle speech a hearing gain,"
42127,BOOK IV.,And tax Sugríva with the crime
42128,BOOK IV.,"Of failing faith and wasted time."""
42129,BOOK IV.,
42130,BOOK IV.,"Then Lakshman, bravest of the brave,"
42131,BOOK IV.,"Obeyed the hest that Ráma gave,"
42132,BOOK IV.,To whom devoting every thought
42133,BOOK IV.,The Vánar's royal town he sought.
42134,BOOK IV.,As Mandar's mountain heaves on high

42142,BOOK IV.,"And where he stepped, so fiercely fleet,"
42143,BOOK IV.,The stones were shivered by his feet.
42144,BOOK IV.,He reached Kishkindhá's city deep
42145,BOOK IV.,"Embosomed where the hills were steep,"
42146,BOOK IV.,Where street and open square were lined
42147,BOOK IV.,With legions of the Vánar kind.
42148,BOOK IV.,"Then, as his lips with fury swelled,"
42149,BOOK IV.,The lord of Raghu's line beheld
42150,BOOK IV.,A stream of Vánar chiefs outpoured
42151,BOOK IV.,To do obeisance to their lord.
42152,BOOK IV.,But when the mighty prince in view
42153,BOOK IV.,"Of the thick coming Vánars drew,"
42154,BOOK IV.,They turned them in amaze to seize
42155,BOOK IV.,Crags of the rock and giant trees.

42169,BOOK IV.,Heard not each clamorous messenger.
42170,BOOK IV.,"Then, summoned at the lords' behest"

42178,BOOK IV.,"Some chieftains, mightier than the rest,"

42193,BOOK IV.,"His bow recalled the expanded hood,"
42194,BOOK IV.,And in his shaft-head bright and keen
42195,BOOK IV.,The flickering of its tongue was seen:
42196,BOOK IV.,And in his own all-conquering might
42197,BOOK IV.,The venom of its deadly bite.
42198,BOOK IV.,"Prince Angad marked his angry look,"
42199,BOOK IV.,And every hope his heart forsook.
42200,BOOK IV.,"Then, his large eyes with fury red,"

42202,BOOK IV.,
42203,BOOK IV.,"""Go tell the king that Lakshman waits"

42205,BOOK IV.,"Whose heart, O tamer of thy foes,"
42206,BOOK IV.,Is heavy with his brother's woes.
42207,BOOK IV.,"Bid him to Ráma's word attend,"
42208,BOOK IV.,And ask if he will aid his friend.
42209,BOOK IV.,"Go, let the king my message learn:"
42210,BOOK IV.,"Then hither with all speed return."""
42211,BOOK IV.,
42212,BOOK IV.,Prince Angad heard and wild with grief
42213,BOOK IV.,Cried as he looked upon the chief:
42214,BOOK IV.,"""'Tis Lakshman's self: impelled by ire"
42215,BOOK IV.,"He seeks the city of my sire."""
42216,BOOK IV.,At the fierce words and furious look
42217,BOOK IV.,Of Raghu's son he quailed and shook.
42218,BOOK IV.,"Back through the city gates he sped,"
42219,BOOK IV.,"And, laden with the tale of dread,"
42220,BOOK IV.,"Sought King Sugríva, filled his ears"
42221,BOOK IV.,And Rumá's with his doubts and fears.
42222,BOOK IV.,"To Rumá and the king he bent,"
42223,BOOK IV.,"And clasped their feet most reverent,"
42224,BOOK IV.,"Clasped the dear feet of Tárá, too,"
42225,BOOK IV.,And told the startling tale anew.
42226,BOOK IV.,
42227,BOOK IV.,"But King Sugríva's ear was dulled,"
42228,BOOK IV.,"By love and wine and languor lulled,"
42229,BOOK IV.,Nor did the words that Angad spake
42230,BOOK IV.,The slumberer from his trance awake.
42231,BOOK IV.,But soon as Raghu's son came nigh
42232,BOOK IV.,"The startled Vánars raised a cry,"
42233,BOOK IV.,"And strove to win his grace, while dread"
42234,BOOK IV.,Each anxious heart disquieted.
42235,BOOK IV.,"They saw, and, as they gathered round,"
42236,BOOK IV.,Rose from the mighty throng a sound
42237,BOOK IV.,"Like torrents when they downward dash,"
42238,BOOK IV.,Or thunder with the lightning's flash.
42239,BOOK IV.,The shouting of the Vánars broke
42240,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva's slumber, and he woke:"
42241,BOOK IV.,"Still with the wine his eyes were red,"
42242,BOOK IV.,His neck with flowers was garlanded.
42243,BOOK IV.,Roused at the voice of Angad came
42244,BOOK IV.,Two Vánar lords of rank and fame;
42245,BOOK IV.,"One Yaksha, one Prabháva hight,--"
42246,BOOK IV.,Wise counsellors of gain and right.
42247,BOOK IV.,"They came and raised their voices high,"
42248,BOOK IV.,And told that Raghu's son was nigh:
42249,BOOK IV.,"""Two brothers steadfast in their truth,"
42250,BOOK IV.,"Each glorious in the bloom of youth,"
42251,BOOK IV.,"Worthy of rule, have left the skies,"
42252,BOOK IV.,And clothed their forms in men's disguise.
42253,BOOK IV.,"One at thy gates, in warlike hands"
42254,BOOK IV.,"Holding his mighty weapon, stands."
42255,BOOK IV.,His message is the charioteer
42256,BOOK IV.,"That brings the eager envoy near,"
42257,BOOK IV.,"Urged onward by his bold intent,"
42258,BOOK IV.,"And by the hest of Ráma sent."""
42259,BOOK IV.,"The gathered Vánars saw and fled,"
42260,BOOK IV.,And raised aloud their cry of dread.
42261,BOOK IV.,"Son of Queen Tárá, Angad ran"
42262,BOOK IV.,To parley with the godlike man.
42263,BOOK IV.,Still fiery-eyed with rage and hate
42264,BOOK IV.,"Stands Lakshman at the city gate,"
42265,BOOK IV.,And trembling Vánars scarce can fly
42266,BOOK IV.,Scathed by the lightning of his eye.
42267,BOOK IV.,"""Go with thy son, thy kith and kin,"
42268,BOOK IV.,"The favour of the prince to win,"
42269,BOOK IV.,And bow thy reverent head that so
42270,BOOK IV.,His fiery wrath may cease to glow.
42271,BOOK IV.,"What righteous Ráma bids thee, do,"
42272,BOOK IV.,"And to thy plighted word be true."""

42279,BOOK IV.,
42280,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva heard, and, trained and tried"
42281,BOOK IV.,"In counsel, to his lords replied:"
42282,BOOK IV.,"""No deed of mine, no hasty word"
42283,BOOK IV.,The anger of the prince has stirred.
42284,BOOK IV.,But haply some who hate me still
42285,BOOK IV.,"And watch their time to work me ill,"
42286,BOOK IV.,"Have slandered me to Raghu's son,"
42287,BOOK IV.,Accused of deeds I ne'er have done.
42288,BOOK IV.,"Now, O my lords--for you are wise--"
42289,BOOK IV.,"Speak truly what your hearts advise,"
42290,BOOK IV.,"And, pondering each event, inquire"
42291,BOOK IV.,The reason of the prince's ire.
42292,BOOK IV.,No fear have I of Lakshman: none:
42293,BOOK IV.,No dread of Raghu's mightier son.
42294,BOOK IV.,"But wrath, that fires a friendly breast"
42295,BOOK IV.,"Without due cause, disturbs my rest."
42296,BOOK IV.,"With labour light is friendship gained,"
42297,BOOK IV.,But with severest toil maintained.
42298,BOOK IV.,"And doubt is strong, and faith is weak,"
42299,BOOK IV.,And friendship dies when traitors speak.
42300,BOOK IV.,Hence is my troubled bosom cold
42301,BOOK IV.,With fear of Ráma lofty-souled;
42302,BOOK IV.,For heavy on my spirit weigh
42303,BOOK IV.,"His favours I can ne'er repay."""
42304,BOOK IV.,
42305,BOOK IV.,He ceased: and Hanumán of all
42306,BOOK IV.,The Vánars in the council hall
42307,BOOK IV.,"In wisdom first, and rank, expressed"
42308,BOOK IV.,The thoughts that filled his prudent breast:
42309,BOOK IV.,"""No marvel thou rememberest yet"
42310,BOOK IV.,"The service thou shouldst ne'er forget,"
42311,BOOK IV.,How the brave prince of Raghu's seed
42312,BOOK IV.,Thy days from fear and peril freed;
42313,BOOK IV.,"And Báli for thy sake o'erthrew,"
42314,BOOK IV.,Whom Indra's self might scarce subdue.
42315,BOOK IV.,I doubt not Ráma's anger burns
42316,BOOK IV.,For the scant love thy heart returns.
42317,BOOK IV.,"For this he sends his brother, him"
42318,BOOK IV.,Whose glory never waxes dim.
42319,BOOK IV.,Sunk in repose thy careless eye
42320,BOOK IV.,"Marks not the seasons as they fly,"
42321,BOOK IV.,Nor sees that autumn has begun
42322,BOOK IV.,With dark blooms opening to the sun.
42323,BOOK IV.,Clear is the sky: no cloudlet mars
42324,BOOK IV.,The splendour of the shining stars.
42325,BOOK IV.,"The balmy air is soft and still,"
42326,BOOK IV.,And clear and bright are lake and rill.
42327,BOOK IV.,Thou heedest not with blinded eyes
42328,BOOK IV.,The hour for warlike enterprise.
42329,BOOK IV.,Hence Lakshman hither comes to break
42330,BOOK IV.,Thy slothful trance and bid thee wake.
42331,BOOK IV.,"Then, Monarch, with a patient ear"
42332,BOOK IV.,"The high-souled Ráma's message hear,"
42333,BOOK IV.,"Which, reft of wife and realm and friends,"
42334,BOOK IV.,Thus by another's mouth he sends.
42335,BOOK IV.,"Thou, Vánar King, hast done amiss:"
42336,BOOK IV.,And now I see no way but this:
42337,BOOK IV.,Before his envoy humbly stand
42338,BOOK IV.,And sue for peace with suppliant hand.
42339,BOOK IV.,High duty bids a courtier seek
42340,BOOK IV.,"His master's weal, and freely speak."
42341,BOOK IV.,So by no thought of fear controlled
42342,BOOK IV.,"My speech, O King, is free and bold,"
42343,BOOK IV.,"For Ráma, if his anger glow,"
42344,BOOK IV.,"Can, with the terrors of his bow"
42345,BOOK IV.,"This earth with all the Gods subdue,"
42346,BOOK IV.,"Gandharvas,(635) and the demon crew."
42347,BOOK IV.,Unwise to stir his wrathful mood
42348,BOOK IV.,Whose favour must again be wooed.
42349,BOOK IV.,"And, most of all, unwise for one"
42350,BOOK IV.,Grateful like thee for service done.
42351,BOOK IV.,Go with thy son and kinsmen: bend
42352,BOOK IV.,Thy humble head and greet thy friend.

42362,BOOK IV.,"Through the fair city Lakshman came,"
42363,BOOK IV.,Invited in Sugríva's name.
42364,BOOK IV.,"Within the gates the guardian bands,"
42365,BOOK IV.,"Of Vánars raised their suppliant hands,"
42366,BOOK IV.,"And in their ordered ranks, amazed,"
42367,BOOK IV.,"Upon the princely hero gazed,"
42368,BOOK IV.,"They marked each burning breath he drew,"
42369,BOOK IV.,The fury of his soul they knew.
42370,BOOK IV.,Their hearts were chilled with sudden fear:
42371,BOOK IV.,"They gazed, but dared not venture near,"
42372,BOOK IV.,"Before his eyes the city, gay"
42373,BOOK IV.,"With gems and flowery gardens, lay,"
42374,BOOK IV.,"Where fane and palace rose on high,"
42375,BOOK IV.,And things of beauty charmed the eye.
42376,BOOK IV.,Where trees of every blossom grew
42377,BOOK IV.,Yielding their fruit in season due
42378,BOOK IV.,To Vánars of celestial seed
42379,BOOK IV.,"Who wore each varied form at need,"
42380,BOOK IV.,Fair-faced and glorious with the shine
42381,BOOK IV.,Of heavenly robes and wreaths divine.
42382,BOOK IV.,"There sandal, aloe, lotus bloomed,"
42383,BOOK IV.,And there delicious breath perfumed
42384,BOOK IV.,"The city's broad street, redolent"
42385,BOOK IV.,Of sugary mead(636) and honey scent.
42386,BOOK IV.,There many a lofty palace rose
42387,BOOK IV.,"Like Vindhya or the Lord of Snows,"
42388,BOOK IV.,And with sweet murmur sparkling rills
42389,BOOK IV.,Leapt lightly down the sheltering hills.
42390,BOOK IV.,"On many a glorious palace, raised"
42391,BOOK IV.,"For prince and noble,(637) Lakshman gazed:"
42392,BOOK IV.,Like clouds of paly hue they shone
42393,BOOK IV.,With fragrant wreaths that hung thereon:
42394,BOOK IV.,"There wealth of jewels was enshrined,"
42395,BOOK IV.,And fairer gems of womankind.
42396,BOOK IV.,"There gleamed, of noble height and size,"
42397,BOOK IV.,"Like Indra's mansion in the skies,"
42398,BOOK IV.,Protected by a crystal fence
42399,BOOK IV.,"Of rock, the royal residence,"
42400,BOOK IV.,With roof and turret high and bright
42401,BOOK IV.,Like Mount Kailása's loftiest height.
42402,BOOK IV.,"There blooming trees, Mahendra's gift,"
42403,BOOK IV.,High o'er the walls were seen to lift
42404,BOOK IV.,"Their golden fruited boughs, that made"
42405,BOOK IV.,With leaf and flower delicious shade.
42406,BOOK IV.,"He saw a band of Vánars wait,"
42407,BOOK IV.,"Wielding their weapons, at the gate"
42408,BOOK IV.,Where golden portals flashed between
42409,BOOK IV.,Celestial garlands red and green.
42410,BOOK IV.,Within Sugríva's fair abode
42411,BOOK IV.,"Unchecked the mighty hero strode,"
42412,BOOK IV.,As when the sun of autumn shrouds
42413,BOOK IV.,His glory in a pile of clouds.
42414,BOOK IV.,"Through seven wide courts he quickly passed,"
42415,BOOK IV.,"And reached the royal tower at last,"
42416,BOOK IV.,Where seats were set with couch and bed
42417,BOOK IV.,Of gold and silver richly spread.
42418,BOOK IV.,While the young chieftain's feet drew near
42419,BOOK IV.,"The sound of music reached his ear,"
42420,BOOK IV.,As the soft breathings of the flute
42421,BOOK IV.,Came blending with the voice and lute.
42422,BOOK IV.,Then beauty showed her youth and grace
42423,BOOK IV.,And varied charm of form and face:
42424,BOOK IV.,"Soft bright-eyed creatures, fair and young,--"
42425,BOOK IV.,"Gay garlands round their necks were hung,"
42426,BOOK IV.,And greater charms to each were lent
42427,BOOK IV.,By richest dress and ornament.
42428,BOOK IV.,He saw the calm attendants wait
42429,BOOK IV.,"About their lord in careless state,"
42430,BOOK IV.,Heard women's girdles chime in sweet
42431,BOOK IV.,Accordance with their tinkling feet.
42432,BOOK IV.,"He heard the anklet's silvery sound,"
42433,BOOK IV.,"He saw the calm that reigned around,"
42434,BOOK IV.,"And o'er him, as he listened, came"
42435,BOOK IV.,"A rush of rage, a flood of shame."
42436,BOOK IV.,He drew his bowstring: with the clang
42437,BOOK IV.,From ease to west the welkin rang:
42438,BOOK IV.,Then in his modest mood withdrew
42439,BOOK IV.,A little from the ladies' view.
42440,BOOK IV.,"And sternly silent stood apart,"
42441,BOOK IV.,While wrath for Ráma filled his heart.
42442,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva knew the sounding string,"
42443,BOOK IV.,And at the call the Vánar king
42444,BOOK IV.,"Sprang swiftly from his golden seat,"
42445,BOOK IV.,And feared the coming prince to meet.
42446,BOOK IV.,Then with cold lips that terror dried
42447,BOOK IV.,To beauteous Tárá thus he cried:
42448,BOOK IV.,"""What cause of anger, O my spouse"
42449,BOOK IV.,"Fair with the charm of lovely brows,"
42450,BOOK IV.,"Sets Lakshman's gentle breast on fire,"
42451,BOOK IV.,And brings him in unwonted ire?
42452,BOOK IV.,"Say, canst thou see, O faultless dame,"
42453,BOOK IV.,A cause to fill his soul with flame?
42454,BOOK IV.,For there must be a reason when
42455,BOOK IV.,Such fury stirs the king of men.
42456,BOOK IV.,"Reveal the sin, if sin of mine"
42457,BOOK IV.,Anger the lord of Raghu's line.
42458,BOOK IV.,"Or go thyself, his rage subdue,"
42459,BOOK IV.,And with soft words his favour woo.
42460,BOOK IV.,Soon as on thee his eyes are set
42461,BOOK IV.,"His heart this anger will forget,"
42462,BOOK IV.,For men like him of lofty mind
42463,BOOK IV.,Are never stern with womankind.
42464,BOOK IV.,First let thy gentle speech disarm
42465,BOOK IV.,"His fury, and his spirit charm,"
42466,BOOK IV.,"And I, from fear of peril free,"
42467,BOOK IV.,"The conqueror of his foes will see."""
42468,BOOK IV.,
42469,BOOK IV.,"She heard: with faltering steps and slow,"
42470,BOOK IV.,"With eyes that shone with trembling glow,"
42471,BOOK IV.,With gold-girt body gently bent
42472,BOOK IV.,To meet the stranger prince she went.
42473,BOOK IV.,When Lakshman saw the Vánar queen
42474,BOOK IV.,"With tranquil eyes and modest mien,"
42475,BOOK IV.,"Before the dame he bent his head,"
42476,BOOK IV.,"And anger, at her presence, fled."
42477,BOOK IV.,"Made bold by draughts of wine, and cheered"
42478,BOOK IV.,"By Lakshman's look no more she feared,"
42479,BOOK IV.,And in the trust his favour lent
42480,BOOK IV.,She thus addressed him eloquent:
42481,BOOK IV.,"""Whence springs thy burning fury? say:"
42482,BOOK IV.,Who dares thy will to disobey?
42483,BOOK IV.,Who checks the maddened flames that seize
42484,BOOK IV.,"On forests full of withered trees?"""
42485,BOOK IV.,
42486,BOOK IV.,"Then Lakshman spoke, her mind to ease,"
42487,BOOK IV.,His kind reply in words like these:
42488,BOOK IV.,
42489,BOOK IV.,"""Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,"
42490,BOOK IV.,"Heedless of duty and of friends,"
42491,BOOK IV.,"Nor dost thou mark, though fondly true,"
42492,BOOK IV.,The evil path his steps pursue.
42493,BOOK IV.,"He cares not for affairs of state,"
42494,BOOK IV.,"Nor us forlorn and desolate,"
42495,BOOK IV.,"But sits a mere spectator still,"
42496,BOOK IV.,A sensual slave to pleasure's will.
42497,BOOK IV.,"Four months were fixed, the time agreed"
42498,BOOK IV.,When he should help us in our need:
42499,BOOK IV.,"But, bound in toils of pleasure fast,"
42500,BOOK IV.,He sees not that the months are past.
42501,BOOK IV.,Where beats the heart which draughts of wine
42502,BOOK IV.,To virtue or to gain incline?
42503,BOOK IV.,Hast thou not heard those draughts destroy
42504,BOOK IV.,Virtue and gain and love and joy?
42505,BOOK IV.,"For those who, helped at need, refuse"
42506,BOOK IV.,"Their aid in turn, their virtue lose:"
42507,BOOK IV.,And they who scorn a friend disdain
42508,BOOK IV.,A treasure naught may buy again.
42509,BOOK IV.,"Thy lord has cast his friend away,"
42510,BOOK IV.,"Nor feared from virtue's path to stray,"
42511,BOOK IV.,"If this be true, declare, O dame"
42512,BOOK IV.,"Who knowest duty's every claim,"
42513,BOOK IV.,What further work remains for us
42514,BOOK IV.,"Deceived and disappointed thus."""
42515,BOOK IV.,
42516,BOOK IV.,"She listened, for his words were kind,"
42517,BOOK IV.,"Where virtue showed with gain combined,"
42518,BOOK IV.,"And thus in turn the prince addressed,"
42519,BOOK IV.,As hope was rising in his breast:
42520,BOOK IV.,"""No time, no cause of wrath I see"
42521,BOOK IV.,With those who live and honour thee:
42522,BOOK IV.,And thou shouldst bear without offence
42523,BOOK IV.,Thy servant's fitful negligence.
42524,BOOK IV.,"I know the seasons glide away,"
42525,BOOK IV.,While Ráma maddens at delay
42526,BOOK IV.,"I know what deed our thanks has earned,"
42527,BOOK IV.,I know that grace should be returned.
42528,BOOK IV.,"But still I know, whate'er befall,"
42529,BOOK IV.,That conquering love is lord of all;
42530,BOOK IV.,"Know where Sugríva's thoughts, possessed"
42531,BOOK IV.,"By one absorbing passion, rest."
42532,BOOK IV.,But he whom sensual joys debase
42533,BOOK IV.,"Heeds not the claim of time and place,"
42534,BOOK IV.,And sees not with his blinded sight
42535,BOOK IV.,His duty or his gain aright.
42536,BOOK IV.,O pardon him who loves me! spare
42537,BOOK IV.,"The Vánar caught in pleasure's snare,"
42538,BOOK IV.,And once again let Ráma grace
42539,BOOK IV.,With favour him who rules our race.
42540,BOOK IV.,"E'en royal saints, whose chief delight"
42541,BOOK IV.,"Was penance and austerest rite,"
42542,BOOK IV.,"At love's commandment have unbent,"
42543,BOOK IV.,Beguiled by sweetest blandishment.
42544,BOOK IV.,"And know, Sugríva, roused at last,"
42545,BOOK IV.,"The order to his lords has passed,"
42546,BOOK IV.,"And, long by love and bliss delayed,"
42547,BOOK IV.,Wakes all on fire your hopes to aid.
42548,BOOK IV.,"A countless host his city fills,"
42549,BOOK IV.,New-gathered from a thousand hills:
42550,BOOK IV.,"Impetuous chiefs, who wear at need"
42551,BOOK IV.,"Each varied form, his legions lead."
42552,BOOK IV.,"Come then, O hero, kept aloof"
42553,BOOK IV.,"By modest awe, nor fear reproof:"
42554,BOOK IV.,A faithful friend untouched by blame
42555,BOOK IV.,"May look upon another's dame."""
42556,BOOK IV.,
42557,BOOK IV.,"He passed within, by Tárá pressed,"
42558,BOOK IV.,"And by his own impatient breast,"
42559,BOOK IV.,Refulgent there in sunlike sheen

42571,BOOK IV.,With doubt and terror in his breast.
42572,BOOK IV.,He heard the prince's furious tread
42573,BOOK IV.,He saw his eyes glow fiercely red.
42574,BOOK IV.,Swift sprang the monarch to his feet
42575,BOOK IV.,Upstarting from his golden seat.
42576,BOOK IV.,"Rose Rumá and her fellows, too,"
42577,BOOK IV.,"And closely round Sugríva drew,"

42579,BOOK IV.,Attendant stars in glittering band.
42580,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva glanced with reddened eyes,"

42584,BOOK IV.,"And Lakshman saw, and, fiercely moved,"

42587,BOOK IV.,"""Famed is the prince who loves the truth,"
42588,BOOK IV.,"Whose soul is touched with tender ruth,"
42589,BOOK IV.,"Who, liberal, keeps each sense subdued,"
42590,BOOK IV.,And pays the debt of gratitude.
42591,BOOK IV.,"But all unmeet a king to be,"
42592,BOOK IV.,The meanest of the mean is he
42593,BOOK IV.,Who basely breaks the promise made
42594,BOOK IV.,To trusting friends who lent him aid.
42595,BOOK IV.,"He sins who for a steed has lied,"
42596,BOOK IV.,As if a hundred steeds had died:
42597,BOOK IV.,"Or if he lie, a cow to win,"
42598,BOOK IV.,Tenfold as heavy is the sin.
42599,BOOK IV.,"But if the lie a man betray,"
42600,BOOK IV.,Both he and his shall all decay.(639)
42601,BOOK IV.,"O Vánar King, the thankless man"
42602,BOOK IV.,"Is worthy of the general ban,"
42603,BOOK IV.,"Who takes assistance of his friends,"
42604,BOOK IV.,And in his turn no service lends.
42605,BOOK IV.,This verse of old by Brahmá sung
42606,BOOK IV.,Is echoed now by every tongue.
42607,BOOK IV.,Hear what He cried in angry mood
42608,BOOK IV.,Bewailing man's ingratitude:
42609,BOOK IV.,"""For draughts of wine, for slaughtered cows,"
42610,BOOK IV.,"For treacherous theft, for broken vows"
42611,BOOK IV.,A pardon is ordained: but none
42612,BOOK IV.,"For thankless scorn of service done."""
42613,BOOK IV.,"Ungrateful, Vánar King, art thou,"
42614,BOOK IV.,And faithless to thy plighted vow.
42615,BOOK IV.,"For Ráma brought thee help, and yet"
42616,BOOK IV.,Thou shunnest to repay the debt:
42617,BOOK IV.,"Or, grateful, thou hadst surely pressed"
42618,BOOK IV.,To aid the hero in his quest.
42619,BOOK IV.,"Thou art, in vulgar pleasures drowned,"
42620,BOOK IV.,False to thy bond in honour bound.
42621,BOOK IV.,Nor yet has Ráma's guileless heart
42622,BOOK IV.,Discerned thee for the thing thou art--
42623,BOOK IV.,A snake who holds the frogs that cries
42624,BOOK IV.,And lures fresh victims as it dies.
42625,BOOK IV.,"Brave Ráma, born for glorious fate,"
42626,BOOK IV.,"Has set thee in thy high estate,"
42627,BOOK IV.,"And to the Vánars' throne restored,"
42628,BOOK IV.,"Great-souled himself, their mean-souled lord."

42630,BOOK IV.,"High thoughted prince, has done for thee,"

42634,BOOK IV.,Lies the sad path thy brother trod.
42635,BOOK IV.,"Then to thy plighted word be true,"
42636,BOOK IV.,Nor let thy steps that path pursue.
42637,BOOK IV.,"Methinks the shafts of Ráma, shot"
42638,BOOK IV.,"Like thunderbolts, thou heedest not,"
42639,BOOK IV.,"Who canst, absorbed in sensual bliss,"
42640,BOOK IV.,"Thy promise from thy mind dismiss."""

42646,BOOK IV.,
42647,BOOK IV.,
42648,BOOK IV.,He ceased: and Tárá starry-eyed
42649,BOOK IV.,Thus to the angry prince replied:
42650,BOOK IV.,"""Not to my lord shouldst thou address"
42651,BOOK IV.,A speech so fraught with bitterness:
42652,BOOK IV.,"Not thus reproached my lord should be,"
42653,BOOK IV.,"And least of all, O Prince, by thee."
42654,BOOK IV.,He is no thankless coward--no--
42655,BOOK IV.,With spirit dead to valour's glow.
42656,BOOK IV.,"From paths of truth he never strays,"
42657,BOOK IV.,Nor wanders in forbidden ways.
42658,BOOK IV.,"Ne'er will Sugríva's heart forget,"
42659,BOOK IV.,"By Ráma saved, the lasting debt."
42660,BOOK IV.,Still in his grateful breast will live
42661,BOOK IV.,The succour none but he could give.
42662,BOOK IV.,"Restored to fame by Ráma's grace,"
42663,BOOK IV.,"To empire o'er the Vánar race,"
42664,BOOK IV.,"From ceaseless dread and toil set free,"
42665,BOOK IV.,Restored to Rumá and to me:
42666,BOOK IV.,"By grief and care and exile tried,"
42667,BOOK IV.,"New to the bliss so long denied,"
42668,BOOK IV.,"Like Visvámitra once, alas,"
42669,BOOK IV.,He marks not how the seasons pass.
42670,BOOK IV.,"That saint ten thousand years remained,"
42671,BOOK IV.,"By sweet Ghritáchí's(640) love enchained,"
42672,BOOK IV.,"And deemed those years, that flew away"
42673,BOOK IV.,"So lightly, but a single day."
42674,BOOK IV.,"O, if those years unheeded flew"
42675,BOOK IV.,"By him who times and seasons knew,"
42676,BOOK IV.,"Unequalled for his lofty mind,"
42677,BOOK IV.,What marvel meaner eyes are blind?
42678,BOOK IV.,"Then be not angry, Raghu's son,"
42679,BOOK IV.,And let thy brother feel for one
42680,BOOK IV.,Who many a weary year has spent
42681,BOOK IV.,Stranger to love and blandishment.
42682,BOOK IV.,"Let not this wrath thy soul inflame,"
42683,BOOK IV.,Like some mean wretch unknown to fame:
42684,BOOK IV.,For high and noble hearts like thine
42685,BOOK IV.,"Love mercy and to ruth incline,"
42686,BOOK IV.,"Calm and deliberate, and slow"
42687,BOOK IV.,With anger's raging fire to glow.
42688,BOOK IV.,"At length, O righteous prince, relent,"
42689,BOOK IV.,"Nor let my words in vain be spent,"
42690,BOOK IV.,"This sudden blaze of fury slake,"
42691,BOOK IV.,I pray thee for Sugríva's sake.
42692,BOOK IV.,He would renounce at Ráma's call
42693,BOOK IV.,"Rumá and Angad, me and all"
42694,BOOK IV.,"Who call him lord: his gold and grain,"
42695,BOOK IV.,The favour of his friend to gain.
42696,BOOK IV.,His arm shall slay the fiend more base
42697,BOOK IV.,"In soul than all his impious race,"
42698,BOOK IV.,And happy Ráma reunite
42699,BOOK IV.,"To Sítá, rival in delight"
42700,BOOK IV.,Of the triumphant Moon when he
42701,BOOK IV.,Rejoins his darling Rohiní.(641)
42702,BOOK IV.,Ten million million demons guard
42703,BOOK IV.,The gates of Lanká firmly barred.
42704,BOOK IV.,"All hope until that host be slain,"
42705,BOOK IV.,To smite the robber king is vain.
42706,BOOK IV.,Nor with Sugríva's aid alone
42707,BOOK IV.,May king and host be overthrown.
42708,BOOK IV.,Thus ere he died--for well he knew--
42709,BOOK IV.,"Spake Báli, and his words are true."
42710,BOOK IV.,"I know not what his proofs might be,"
42711,BOOK IV.,But speak the words he spake to me.
42712,BOOK IV.,Hence far and wide our lords are sent
42713,BOOK IV.,"To raise the mightiest armament,"
42714,BOOK IV.,For their return Sugríva waits
42715,BOOK IV.,Ere he can sally from his gates.
42716,BOOK IV.,Still is the oath Sugríva swore
42717,BOOK IV.,Kept firmly even as before:
42718,BOOK IV.,And the great host this day will be
42719,BOOK IV.,"Assembled by the king's decree,"
42720,BOOK IV.,"Ten thousand thousand troops, who wear"
42721,BOOK IV.,"The form of monkey and of bear,"
42722,BOOK IV.,Prepared for thee the war to wage:
42723,BOOK IV.,Then let thy wrath no longer rage.
42724,BOOK IV.,The matrons of the Vánar race
42725,BOOK IV.,See marks of fury in thy face;

42739,BOOK IV.,"His altered mood Sugríva saw,"

42741,BOOK IV.,Like raiment heavy with the rain
42742,BOOK IV.,Which on his troubled soul had lain.
42743,BOOK IV.,Then quickly to the ground he threw
42744,BOOK IV.,"His flowery garland, bright of hue,"
42745,BOOK IV.,"Which round his royal neck he wore,"
42746,BOOK IV.,"And, sobered, was himself once more."

42749,BOOK IV.,"""My glory, wealth, and royal sway"
42750,BOOK IV.,To other hands had passed away:
42751,BOOK IV.,"But Ráma to my rescue came,"
42752,BOOK IV.,And gave me back my power and fame.

42754,BOOK IV.,"Could nurse the hope to pay in part,"
42755,BOOK IV.,"By service of a life, the deed"
42756,BOOK IV.,Of Ráma sprung of heavenly seed?
42757,BOOK IV.,"His foeman Rávan shall be slain,"
42758,BOOK IV.,And Sítá shall be his again.
42759,BOOK IV.,"The hero's side I will not leave,"

42761,BOOK IV.,What need of help has he who drew
42762,BOOK IV.,"His bow, and one great arrow flew"

42767,BOOK IV.,With hill and wood and rooted rock
42768,BOOK IV.,Quaked feverous with the thunder shock?
42769,BOOK IV.,"Yet all my legions will I bring,"
42770,BOOK IV.,And follow close the warrior king
42771,BOOK IV.,Marching on his impetuous way
42772,BOOK IV.,Fierce Rávan and his hosts to slay.
42773,BOOK IV.,"If I be guilty of offence,"

42814,BOOK IV.,"In highlands by the western sea,"
42815,BOOK IV.,"On that east hill whence springs the sun,"
42816,BOOK IV.,Or where he sinks when day is done.
42817,BOOK IV.,Call the great chiefs whose legions fill

42819,BOOK IV.,Where every one in strength and size
42820,BOOK IV.,With the stupendous Anjan(644) vies.
42821,BOOK IV.,"Call those, with tints of burnished gold"

42823,BOOK IV.,"Those who on Dhúmra roam, or hide"
42824,BOOK IV.,In the wild woods on Meru's side.
42825,BOOK IV.,"Call those who, brilliant as the sun,"
42826,BOOK IV.,"On high Mahárun leap and run,"
42827,BOOK IV.,Quaffing sweet juices that distil
42828,BOOK IV.,"From odorous trees upon the hill,"

42864,BOOK IV.,Where Vishnu's splendid sphere is set.(646)
42865,BOOK IV.,"By sea, on hill, by wood and lake"
42866,BOOK IV.,"They called to arms for Ráma's sake,"

42873,BOOK IV.,"Ten million others, brave and bold,"
42874,BOOK IV.,"With coats that shone like burning gold,"
42875,BOOK IV.,Came flying from the mountain crest
42876,BOOK IV.,Where sinks the weary sun to rest.
42877,BOOK IV.,"Impetuous from the northern skies,"
42878,BOOK IV.,"Where Mount Kailása's summits rise,"
42879,BOOK IV.,"Ten hundred millions hasted, hued"
42880,BOOK IV.,"Like manes of lions, ne'er subdued:"
42881,BOOK IV.,"The dwellers on Himálaya's side,"
42882,BOOK IV.,"Whose food his roots and fruit supplied,"
42883,BOOK IV.,With rangers of the Vindhyan chain
42884,BOOK IV.,And neighbours of the Milky Main.(647)
42885,BOOK IV.,"Some from the palm groves where they fed,"
42886,BOOK IV.,Some from the woods of betel sped:
42887,BOOK IV.,"In countless numbers, fierce and brave,"
42888,BOOK IV.,"They came from mountain, lake, and cave."
42889,BOOK IV.,
42890,BOOK IV.,As on their way the Vánars went
42891,BOOK IV.,"To rouse each distant armament,"
42892,BOOK IV.,They chanced that wondrous tree to view
42893,BOOK IV.,That on Himálaya's summit grew.
42894,BOOK IV.,Of old upon that sacred height
42895,BOOK IV.,"Was wrought Mahesvar's(648) glorious rite,"
42896,BOOK IV.,"Which every God in heaven beheld,"
42897,BOOK IV.,And his glad heart with triumph swelled.
42898,BOOK IV.,There from pure seed at random sown
42899,BOOK IV.,"Bright plants with luscious fruit had grown,"
42900,BOOK IV.,"And, sweet as Amrit to the taste,"
42901,BOOK IV.,The summit of the mountain graced.
42902,BOOK IV.,Who once should eat the virtuous fruit
42903,BOOK IV.,"That sprang from so divine a root,"
42904,BOOK IV.,One whole revolving moon should be
42905,BOOK IV.,From every pang of hunger free.
42906,BOOK IV.,The Vánars culled the fruit they found
42907,BOOK IV.,Ripe on the sacrificial ground
42908,BOOK IV.,"With rare celestial odours sweet,"
42909,BOOK IV.,To lay them at Sugríva's feet.
42910,BOOK IV.,Those noble envoys scoured the land
42911,BOOK IV.,To summon every Vánar band
42912,BOOK IV.,Then swiftly homeward at the head
42913,BOOK IV.,Of countless armaments they sped.
42914,BOOK IV.,They gathered by Kishkindhá's wall.
42915,BOOK IV.,"They thronged Sugríva's palace hall,"
42916,BOOK IV.,"And, richly laden, bare within"
42917,BOOK IV.,That fruit of heavenly origin.
42918,BOOK IV.,"Their gifts before their king they spread,"
42919,BOOK IV.,And thus in tones of triumph said:
42920,BOOK IV.,
42921,BOOK IV.,"""Through every land our way we took"

42942,BOOK IV.,"""Now, chieftain, if thy will be so,"

42955,BOOK IV.,The litter of the glorious king.
42956,BOOK IV.,"""Mount, O my friend."" Sugríva cried,"
42957,BOOK IV.,And straight Sumitrá's son complied.
42958,BOOK IV.,Then took by Lakshman's side his place
42959,BOOK IV.,"The sovereign of the woodland race,"
42960,BOOK IV.,"Upraised by Vánars, fleet and strong,"
42961,BOOK IV.,Who bore the glittering load along.
42962,BOOK IV.,On high above his royal head
42963,BOOK IV.,"A paly canopy was spread,"
42964,BOOK IV.,And chouries white in many a hand
42965,BOOK IV.,"The forehead of the monarch fanned,"
42966,BOOK IV.,And shell and drum and song and shout
42967,BOOK IV.,Pealed round him as the king passed out.
42968,BOOK IV.,About the monarch went a throng
42969,BOOK IV.,"Of Vánar warriors brave and strong,"
42970,BOOK IV.,As onward to the mountain shade
42971,BOOK IV.,Where Ráma dwelt his way he made.
42972,BOOK IV.,Soon as the lovely spot he viewed
42973,BOOK IV.,"Where Ráma lived in solitude,"
42974,BOOK IV.,"The Vánar monarch, far-renowed,"
42975,BOOK IV.,"With Lakshman, lightly stepped to ground,"
42976,BOOK IV.,And to the son of Raghu went
42977,BOOK IV.,Joining his raised hands reverent.
42978,BOOK IV.,"As their great leader raised his hands,"
42979,BOOK IV.,So suppliant stood the Vánar bands.
42980,BOOK IV.,Well pleased the son of Raghu saw
42981,BOOK IV.,"Those legions, hushed in reverent awe,"
42982,BOOK IV.,Stand silent like the tranquil floods
42983,BOOK IV.,That raise their hands of lotus buds.
42984,BOOK IV.,"But Ráma, when the king, to greet"
42985,BOOK IV.,"His friend, had bowed him at his feet,"
42986,BOOK IV.,"Raised him who ruled the Vánar race,"
42987,BOOK IV.,And held him in a close embrace:
42988,BOOK IV.,"Then, when his arms he had unknit,"
42989,BOOK IV.,"Besought him by his side to sit,"
42990,BOOK IV.,And thus with gentle words the best
42991,BOOK IV.,Of men the Vánar king addressed:
42992,BOOK IV.,
42993,BOOK IV.,"""The prince who well his days divides,"
42994,BOOK IV.,And knows aright the times and tides
42995,BOOK IV.,"To follow duty, joy, or gain,"
42996,BOOK IV.,"He, only he, deserves to reign."
42997,BOOK IV.,"But he who wealth and virtue leaves,"
42998,BOOK IV.,"And every hour to pleasure cleaves,"
42999,BOOK IV.,Falls from his bliss like him who wakes
43000,BOOK IV.,From slumber on a branch that breaks.
43001,BOOK IV.,"True king is he who smites his foes,"
43002,BOOK IV.,"And favour to his servants shows,"
43003,BOOK IV.,And of that fruit makes timely use
43004,BOOK IV.,"Which virtue, wealth, and joy produce."
43005,BOOK IV.,The hour is come that bids thee rise
43006,BOOK IV.,To aid me in my enterprise.
43007,BOOK IV.,"Then call thy nobles to debate,"
43008,BOOK IV.,"And with their help deliberate."""
43009,BOOK IV.,
43010,BOOK IV.,"""Lost was my power,"" the king replied,"
43011,BOOK IV.,"""All strength had fled, all hope had died."
43012,BOOK IV.,"The Vánars owned another lord,"
43013,BOOK IV.,But by thy grace was all restored.
43014,BOOK IV.,"All this, O conqueror of the foe,"
43015,BOOK IV.,To thee and Lakshman's aid I owe.
43016,BOOK IV.,And his should be the villain's shame
43017,BOOK IV.,Who durst deny the sacred claim.
43018,BOOK IV.,These Vánar chiefs of noblest birth
43019,BOOK IV.,"Have at my bidding roamed the earth,"
43020,BOOK IV.,And brought from distant regions all
43021,BOOK IV.,Our legions at their monarch's call:
43022,BOOK IV.,"Fierce bears with monkey troops combined,"
43023,BOOK IV.,"And apes of every varied kind,"
43024,BOOK IV.,"Terrific in their forms, who dwell"

43067,BOOK IV.,"Yes, near, Sugríva, is the day"

43075,BOOK IV.,The mighty clouds that hung o'erhead
43076,BOOK IV.,"From east to west thick darkness spread,"
43077,BOOK IV.,And earth to her foundations shook
43078,BOOK IV.,"With hill and forest, lake and brook."
43079,BOOK IV.,Then hidden was the ground beneath
43080,BOOK IV.,"Fierce warriors armed with fearful teeth,"
43081,BOOK IV.,"Hosts numberless, each lord in size"
43082,BOOK IV.,A match for him who rules the skies:

43085,BOOK IV.,"Some like the morning sun were bright,"

43118,BOOK IV.,"The bears delighted to obey,"
43119,BOOK IV.,With swarming myriads onward pressed
43120,BOOK IV.,True to his lord Sugríva's hest;
43121,BOOK IV.,"And princely Ruman, dear to fame,"
43122,BOOK IV.,"Led millions whom no hosts could tame,"
43123,BOOK IV.,All these and many a chief beside(658)
43124,BOOK IV.,Came onward fierce in warlike pride.
43125,BOOK IV.,"They covered all the plain, and still"
43126,BOOK IV.,Pressed forward over wood and hill.
43127,BOOK IV.,In rows for many a league around
43128,BOOK IV.,They rested on the grassy ground;
43129,BOOK IV.,"Or to Sugríva made their way,"
43130,BOOK IV.,"Like clouds about the Lord of Day,"
43131,BOOK IV.,And to the king their proud heads bent
43132,BOOK IV.,In power and might preeminent.

43150,BOOK IV.,"Chiefs strong as Indra's self, who speed"
43151,BOOK IV.,"Wher'er they list, these armies lead."
43152,BOOK IV.,Fierce and terrific to the view
43153,BOOK IV.,"As Daityas or the Dánav(659) crew,"
43154,BOOK IV.,Famed in all lands for souls afire
43155,BOOK IV.,"With lofty thoughts, they never tire,"
43156,BOOK IV.,"O'er hill and vale they wander free,"

43160,BOOK IV.,"Whate'er thy heart advises, say:"
43161,BOOK IV.,"Thy mandates will the host obey."""
43162,BOOK IV.,
43163,BOOK IV.,"Then answered Ráma, as he pressed"

43165,BOOK IV.,"""O search for my lost Sítá, strive"
43166,BOOK IV.,To find her if she still survive:
43167,BOOK IV.,And in thy wondrous wisdom trace
43168,BOOK IV.,Fierce Rávan to his dwelling-place.

43177,BOOK IV.,
43178,BOOK IV.,He ceased: at King Sugríva's call
43179,BOOK IV.,Near came a Vánar strong and tall.
43180,BOOK IV.,"Huge as a towering mountain, loud"
43181,BOOK IV.,"As some tremendous thunder cloud,"
43182,BOOK IV.,A prince who warlike legions led:
43183,BOOK IV.,To him his sovereign turned and said:
43184,BOOK IV.,"""Go, take ten thousand(660) of our race"

43216,BOOK IV.,And Sona's(673) waters swift and strong
43217,BOOK IV.,With ruddy billows foam along.
43218,BOOK IV.,"Search where his shelving banks descend,"
43219,BOOK IV.,Search where the hanging woods extend.
43220,BOOK IV.,Try if the pathless thickets screen
43221,BOOK IV.,The robber and the captive queen.
43222,BOOK IV.,Search where the torrent floods that rend

43229,BOOK IV.,Against rude rocks the billows dash:

43252,BOOK IV.,Whose every ripple as it curls
43253,BOOK IV.,Gleams glorious with its wealth of pearls.
43254,BOOK IV.,Amid that sea like pale clouds spread
43255,BOOK IV.,The white Mount Rishabh(678) rears his head.
43256,BOOK IV.,About the mountain's glorious waist

43265,BOOK IV.,"Another flood your search shall find,"
43266,BOOK IV.,"A waste of waters, wild and drear,"

43270,BOOK IV.,There rises up a fearful cry
43271,BOOK IV.,"From the sea things that move thereby,"

43286,BOOK IV.,A triple-headed palm of gold--
43287,BOOK IV.,Meet standard for the lofty-souled--
43288,BOOK IV.,Springs towering from the mountain's crest
43289,BOOK IV.,"Beneath whose shade he loves to rest,"
43290,BOOK IV.,So that in eastern realms each God
43291,BOOK IV.,May use it as a measuring-rod.

43297,BOOK IV.,With golden trees that clothe the height.

43299,BOOK IV.,Ten leagues in height and one league square
43300,BOOK IV.,"Saumanas, wrought of glistering gold,"

43828,BOOK IV.,"I sought the regions of the west,"
43829,BOOK IV.,"And gazed on Asta,(746) where the sun"
43830,BOOK IV.,Sinks when his daily course is run.
43831,BOOK IV.,Then from that noblest hill I fled
43832,BOOK IV.,"And to the northern country sped,"
43833,BOOK IV.,"Saw Himaván,(747) and Meru's steep,"
43834,BOOK IV.,And stood beside the northern deep.
43835,BOOK IV.,"But when, by Báli's might oppressed,"
43836,BOOK IV.,"E'en in those wilds I could not rest,"
43837,BOOK IV.,"Came Hanumán the wise and brave,"
43838,BOOK IV.,And thus his prudent counsel gave:
43839,BOOK IV.,"""'I told thee how Matanga(748) cursed"
43840,BOOK IV.,"Thy tyrant, that his head should burst"
43841,BOOK IV.,"In pieces, should he dare invade"
43842,BOOK IV.,The precincts of that tranquil shade.
43843,BOOK IV.,There may we dwell in peace and be
43844,BOOK IV.,"From thy oppressor's malice free."""
43845,BOOK IV.,"We went to Rishyamúka's hill,"
43846,BOOK IV.,And spent our days secure from ill
43847,BOOK IV.,"Where, with that curse upon his head,"

43856,BOOK IV.,Thus forth in quest of Sítá went
43857,BOOK IV.,The legions King Sugríva sent.
43858,BOOK IV.,To many a distant town they hied
43859,BOOK IV.,By many a lake and river's side.
43860,BOOK IV.,"As their great sovereign's order taught,"
43861,BOOK IV.,"Through valleys, plains, and groves they sought."
43862,BOOK IV.,They toiled unresting through the day:
43863,BOOK IV.,At night upon the ground they lay
43864,BOOK IV.,"Where the tall trees, whose branches swayed"
43865,BOOK IV.,"Beneath their fruit, gave pleasant shade."
43866,BOOK IV.,"Then, when a weary month was spent,"
43867,BOOK IV.,"Back to Prasravan's hill they went,"
43868,BOOK IV.,And stood with faces of despair
43869,BOOK IV.,Before their king Sugríva there.
43870,BOOK IV.,"Thus, having wandered through the east,"
43871,BOOK IV.,"Great Vinata his labours ceased,"
43872,BOOK IV.,And weary of the fruitless pain
43873,BOOK IV.,"Returned to meet the king again,"

43875,BOOK IV.,Had led his Vánar legions forth.
43876,BOOK IV.,Now to Sugríva he sped
43877,BOOK IV.,With all his host dispirited.
43878,BOOK IV.,"Sushen the western realms had sought,"
43879,BOOK IV.,And homeward now his legions brought.
43880,BOOK IV.,"All to Sugríva came, where still"
43881,BOOK IV.,He sat with Ráma on the hill.
43882,BOOK IV.,Before their sovereign humbly bent

43888,BOOK IV.,Our feet by thy command have traced
43889,BOOK IV.,"The tangled thicket and the waste,"
43890,BOOK IV.,And dens and dingles hard to pass
43891,BOOK IV.,for creeping plants and matted grass.
43892,BOOK IV.,"Well have we searched with toil and pain,"
43893,BOOK IV.,And monstrous creatures have we slain

43907,BOOK IV.,Through Vindhya's pathless glens he sped
43908,BOOK IV.,And left no spot unvisited.
43909,BOOK IV.,"He gazed from every mountain height,"
43910,BOOK IV.,"He sought each cavern dark as night,"
43911,BOOK IV.,And wandered through the bloomy shade
43912,BOOK IV.,"By pool and river and cascade,"
43913,BOOK IV.,"But, though they sought in every place,"
43914,BOOK IV.,Of Sítá yet they found no trace.
43915,BOOK IV.,On fruit and woodland berries fed
43916,BOOK IV.,"Through many a lonely wild they sped,"
43917,BOOK IV.,"And reached at last, untouched by fear,"
43918,BOOK IV.,A desert terrible and drear:
43919,BOOK IV.,"A fruitless waste, a land of gloom"
43920,BOOK IV.,"Where trees were bare of leaf and bloom,"
43921,BOOK IV.,"Where every scanty stream was dried,"
43922,BOOK IV.,And niggard earth her roots denied.
43923,BOOK IV.,"No elephants through all the ground,"
43924,BOOK IV.,No buffaloes or deer are found.
43925,BOOK IV.,"There roams no tiger, pard, or bear,"

43929,BOOK IV.,"There rise no lilies from the flood,"

43933,BOOK IV.,"There lived a hermit Kandu named,"
43934,BOOK IV.,For truth and wealth of penance famed.
43935,BOOK IV.,Whom fervent zeal and holy rite
43936,BOOK IV.,Had dowered with all-surpassing might.
43937,BOOK IV.,"His little son, a ten year child--"

43940,BOOK IV.,"Who cursed the forest in his rage,"
43941,BOOK IV.,"Doomed from that hour to shelter none,"
43942,BOOK IV.,A waste for bird and beast to shun.
43943,BOOK IV.,"They searched by every forest edge,"
43944,BOOK IV.,"They searched each cave and mountain ledge,"
43945,BOOK IV.,And thickets whence the water fell
43946,BOOK IV.,Wandering through the tangled dell.
43947,BOOK IV.,Striving to do Sugríva's will
43948,BOOK IV.,They roamed along each leafy rill.
43949,BOOK IV.,"But vain were all endeavours, vain"
43950,BOOK IV.,"The careful search, the toil and pain."
43951,BOOK IV.,"Through one dark grove they scarce could wind,"
43952,BOOK IV.,So thick were creepers intertwined.
43953,BOOK IV.,There as they struggled through the wood
43954,BOOK IV.,Before their eyes an Asur(750) stood.
43955,BOOK IV.,"High as a towering hill, his pride"
43956,BOOK IV.,The very Gods in heaven defied.
43957,BOOK IV.,When on the fiend their glances fell
43958,BOOK IV.,Each braced him for the combat well.
43959,BOOK IV.,"The demon raised his arm on high,"
43960,BOOK IV.,And rushed upon them with a cry.
43961,BOOK IV.,"Him Angad smote,--for, sure, he thought"
43962,BOOK IV.,This was the fiend they long had sought.
43963,BOOK IV.,"From his huge mouth by Angad felled,"
43964,BOOK IV.,"The blood in rushing torrents welled,"
43965,BOOK IV.,"As, like a mountain from his base"
43966,BOOK IV.,"Uptorn, he dropped upon his face."
43967,BOOK IV.,Thus fell the mighty fiend: and they
43968,BOOK IV.,Through the thick wood pursued their way;
43969,BOOK IV.,"Then, weary with the toil, reclined"

43982,BOOK IV.,But all in vain: no eye has seen

43984,BOOK IV.,"A dreary time has passed away,"
43985,BOOK IV.,And stern is he we all obey.

44010,BOOK IV.,"By lake and brook and white cascade,"
44011,BOOK IV.,"Till every spot, as our great lord"

44014,BOOK IV.,"Uprose the Vánars one and all,"
44015,BOOK IV.,"Obedient to the chieftain's call,"
44016,BOOK IV.,And over the southern region sped
44017,BOOK IV.,Where Vindhya's tangled forests spread.
44018,BOOK IV.,They clomb that hill that towers on high
44019,BOOK IV.,"Like a huge cloud in autumn's sky,"
44020,BOOK IV.,"Where many a cavern yawns, and streaks"
44021,BOOK IV.,Of radiant silver deck the peaks.
44022,BOOK IV.,In eager search they wandered through
44023,BOOK IV.,"The forests where the Lodh trees grew,"
44024,BOOK IV.,"Where the dark leaves were thick and green,"
44025,BOOK IV.,But found not Ráma's darling queen.

44040,BOOK IV.,"And stony pass and wooded steep,"
44041,BOOK IV.,"The lion's and the tiger's home,"

44045,BOOK IV.,The day prescribed was near and they
44046,BOOK IV.,Still wandered on their weary way.
44047,BOOK IV.,They reached the southern land beset
44048,BOOK IV.,With woody mountains like a net.
44049,BOOK IV.,At length a mighty cave they spied
44050,BOOK IV.,That opened in a mountain's side.
44051,BOOK IV.,Where many a verdant creeper grew
44052,BOOK IV.,And o'er the mouth its tendrils threw.
44053,BOOK IV.,"Thence issued crane, and swan, and drake,"
44054,BOOK IV.,And trooping birds that love the lake.
44055,BOOK IV.,The Vánars rushed within to cool
44056,BOOK IV.,Their fevered lips in spring or pool.
44057,BOOK IV.,"Vast was the cavern dark and dread,"
44058,BOOK IV.,Where not a ray of light was shed;
44059,BOOK IV.,"Yet not the more their eyesight failed,"
44060,BOOK IV.,Their courage sank or valour quailed.

44062,BOOK IV.,"With hunger, thirst, and toil distressed,"
44063,BOOK IV.,"Poor helpless wanderers, sad, forlorn,"
44064,BOOK IV.,With wasted faces wan and worn.
44065,BOOK IV.,"At length, when life seemed lost for aye,"
44066,BOOK IV.,"They saw a splendour as of day,"
44067,BOOK IV.,"A wondrous forest, fair and bright,"
44068,BOOK IV.,Where golden trees shot flamy light.
44069,BOOK IV.,And lotus-covered pools were there
44070,BOOK IV.,"With pleasant waters fresh and fair,"
44071,BOOK IV.,And streams their rippling currents rolled
44072,BOOK IV.,By seats of silver and of gold.
44073,BOOK IV.,Fair houses reared their stately height
44074,BOOK IV.,"Of burnished gold and lazulite,"
44075,BOOK IV.,And glorious was the lustre thrown
44076,BOOK IV.,Through lattices of precious stone.
44077,BOOK IV.,And there were flowers and fruit on stems
44078,BOOK IV.,"Of coral decked with rarest gems,"
44079,BOOK IV.,"And emerald leaves on silver trees,"
44080,BOOK IV.,And honeycomb and golden bees.
44081,BOOK IV.,"Then as the Vánars nearer drew,"

44190,BOOK IV.,Forth trooping from the dark-recess

44251,BOOK IV.,They looked upon the boundless main
44252,BOOK IV.,The awful seat of Varun's reign.
44253,BOOK IV.,And heard his waters roar and rave
44254,BOOK IV.,Terrific with each crested wave.
44255,BOOK IV.,"Then, in the depths of sorrow drowned,"
44256,BOOK IV.,"They sat upon the bosky ground,"
44257,BOOK IV.,"And sadly, as they pondered, grieved"
44258,BOOK IV.,For days gone by and naught achieved.
44259,BOOK IV.,Pain pierced them through with sharper sting
44260,BOOK IV.,"When, gazing on the trees of spring,"
44261,BOOK IV.,They saw each waving bough that showed
44262,BOOK IV.,"The treasures of its glorious load,"
44263,BOOK IV.,"And helpless, fainting with the weight"
44264,BOOK IV.,Of woe they sank disconsolate.
44265,BOOK IV.,"Then, lion-shouldered, stout and strong,"
44266,BOOK IV.,"The noblest of the Vánar throng,"
44267,BOOK IV.,"Angad the prince imperial rose,"
44268,BOOK IV.,"And, deeply stricken by the woes"
44269,BOOK IV.,"That his impetuous spirit broke,"
44270,BOOK IV.,Thus gently to the chieftains spoke:
44271,BOOK IV.,"""Mark ye not, Vánars, that the day"
44272,BOOK IV.,Our monarch fixed has passed away?
44273,BOOK IV.,"The month is lost in toil and pain,"
44274,BOOK IV.,"And now, my friends, what hopes remain?"
44275,BOOK IV.,"On you, in lore of counsel tried,"
44276,BOOK IV.,Our king Sugríva most relied.
44277,BOOK IV.,"Your hearts, with strong affection fraught,"
44278,BOOK IV.,"His weal in every labour sought,"
44279,BOOK IV.,And the true valour of your band
44280,BOOK IV.,Was blazoned wide in every land.
44281,BOOK IV.,"Forth on the toilsome search you sped,"
44282,BOOK IV.,"By me--for so he willed it--led,"
44283,BOOK IV.,"To us, of every hope bereft,"
44284,BOOK IV.,Death is the only refuge left.
44285,BOOK IV.,For none a happy life may see
44286,BOOK IV.,Who fails to do our king's decree.
44287,BOOK IV.,"Come, let us all from food abstain,"
44288,BOOK IV.,"And perish thus, since hope is vain."
44289,BOOK IV.,"Stern is our king and swift to ire,"
44290,BOOK IV.,"Imperious, proud, and fierce like fire,"
44291,BOOK IV.,And ne'er will pardon us the crime
44292,BOOK IV.,Of fruitless search and wasted time.
44293,BOOK IV.,"Far better thus to end our lives,"
44294,BOOK IV.,"And leave our wealth, our homes and wives,"
44295,BOOK IV.,"Leave our dear little ones and all,"
44296,BOOK IV.,Than by his vengeful hand to fall.
44297,BOOK IV.,Think not Sugríva's wrath will spare
44298,BOOK IV.,"Me Báli's son, imperial heir:"
44299,BOOK IV.,"For Raghu's royal son, not he,"
44300,BOOK IV.,To this high place anointed me.
44301,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva, long my bitter foe,"
44302,BOOK IV.,"With eager hand will strike the blow,"
44303,BOOK IV.,"And, mindful of the old offence,"
44304,BOOK IV.,"Will slay me now for negligence,"
44305,BOOK IV.,Nor will my pitying friends have power
44306,BOOK IV.,To save me in the deadly hour.
44307,BOOK IV.,"No--here, O chieftains, will I lie"
44308,BOOK IV.,"By ocean's marge, and fast and die."""
44309,BOOK IV.,
44310,BOOK IV.,They heard the royal prince declare
44311,BOOK IV.,The purpose of his fixt despair;
44312,BOOK IV.,"And all, by common terror moved,"
44313,BOOK IV.,His speech in these sad words approved:
44314,BOOK IV.,"""Sugríva's heart is hard and stern,"
44315,BOOK IV.,And Ráma's thoughts for Sítá yearn.
44316,BOOK IV.,Our forfeit lives will surely pay
44317,BOOK IV.,"For idle search and long delay,"
44318,BOOK IV.,And our fierce king will bid us die
44319,BOOK IV.,"The favour of his friend to buy."""
44320,BOOK IV.,
44321,BOOK IV.,Then Tára softly spake to cheer
44322,BOOK IV.,The Vánars' hearts oppressed by fear:
44323,BOOK IV.,"""Despair no more, your doubts dispel:"
44324,BOOK IV.,Come in this ample cavern dwell.
44325,BOOK IV.,There may we live in blissful ease
44326,BOOK IV.,"Mid springs and fruit and bloomy trees,"
44327,BOOK IV.,"Secure from every foe's assault,"
44328,BOOK IV.,For magic framed the wondrous vault.
44329,BOOK IV.,Protected there we need not fear
44330,BOOK IV.,Though Ráma and our king come near;
44331,BOOK IV.,Nor dread e'en him who batters down
44332,BOOK IV.,"The portals of the foeman's town.""(756)"

44340,BOOK IV.,"But Hanumán, while Tára, best"
44341,BOOK IV.,"Of splendid chiefs his thought expressed,"
44342,BOOK IV.,Perceived that Báli's princely son
44343,BOOK IV.,A kingdom for himself had won.(757)
44344,BOOK IV.,His keen eye marked in him combined
44345,BOOK IV.,"The warrior's arm, the ruler's mind,"
44346,BOOK IV.,And every noble gift should grace
44347,BOOK IV.,The happy sovereign of his race:
44348,BOOK IV.,Marked how he grew with ripening age
44349,BOOK IV.,"More glorious and bold and sage,--"
44350,BOOK IV.,Like the young moon that night by night
44351,BOOK IV.,"Shines on with ever waxing light,--"
44352,BOOK IV.,"Brave as his royal father, wise"
44353,BOOK IV.,As he who counsels in the skies:(758)
44354,BOOK IV.,"Marked how, forwearied with the quest,"
44355,BOOK IV.,"He heeded not his liege's hest,"
44356,BOOK IV.,But Tára's every word obeyed
44357,BOOK IV.,Like Indra still by Sukra(759) swayed.
44358,BOOK IV.,Then with his prudent speech he tried
44359,BOOK IV.,"To better thoughts the prince to guide,"
44360,BOOK IV.,And by division's skilful art
44361,BOOK IV.,The Vánars and the youth to part:
44362,BOOK IV.,"""Illustrious Angad, thou in fight"
44363,BOOK IV.,"Hast far surpassed thy father's might,"
44364,BOOK IV.,"Most worthy, like thy sire of old,"
44365,BOOK IV.,The empire of our race to hold.
44366,BOOK IV.,The Vánars' fickle people range
44367,BOOK IV.,From wish to wish and welcome change.
44368,BOOK IV.,Their wives and babes they will not leave
44369,BOOK IV.,And to their new-made sovereign cleave.
44370,BOOK IV.,"No art, no gifts will draw away"
44371,BOOK IV.,"The Vánars from Sugríva's sway,"
44372,BOOK IV.,"Through hope of wealth, through fear of pain"
44373,BOOK IV.,Still faithful will they all remain.
44374,BOOK IV.,Thou fondly hopest in this cave
44375,BOOK IV.,The vengeance of the foe to brave.
44376,BOOK IV.,But Lakshman's arm a shower will send
44377,BOOK IV.,Of deadly shafts those walls to rend.
44378,BOOK IV.,Like Indra's bolts his shafts have power
44379,BOOK IV.,To cleave the mountain like a flower.
44380,BOOK IV.,"O Angad, mark my counsel well:"
44381,BOOK IV.,"If in this cave thou choose to dwell,"
44382,BOOK IV.,These Vánar hosts with one accord
44383,BOOK IV.,"Will quit thee for their lawful lord,"
44384,BOOK IV.,And turn again with thirsty eyes
44385,BOOK IV.,To wife and babe and all they prize.
44386,BOOK IV.,Thou in the lonely cavern left
44387,BOOK IV.,"Of followers and friends bereft,"
44388,BOOK IV.,"Wilt be in all thy woe, alas,"
44389,BOOK IV.,Weak as a blade of trembling grass:
44390,BOOK IV.,"And Lakshman's arrows, keen and fierce"
44391,BOOK IV.,"From his strong bow, thy heart will pierce."
44392,BOOK IV.,But if in lowly reverence meek
44393,BOOK IV.,"Sugríva's court with us thou seek,"
44394,BOOK IV.,"He, as thy birth demands, will share"
44395,BOOK IV.,The kingdom with the royal heir.
44396,BOOK IV.,"Thy loving kinsman, true and wise,"
44397,BOOK IV.,Looks on thee still with favouring eyes.

44399,BOOK IV.,And ne'er will vex or injure thee.
44400,BOOK IV.,"He loves thy mother, lives for her"

44414,BOOK IV.,His purity and self-control?
44415,BOOK IV.,"How is he worthy of our trust,"
44416,BOOK IV.,"Righteous, and true, and wise, and just,"
44417,BOOK IV.,"Who, shrinking not from sin and shame,"
44418,BOOK IV.,Durst take his living brother's dame?
44419,BOOK IV.,"Who, when, in stress of mortal strife"
44420,BOOK IV.,"His noble brother fought for life,"
44421,BOOK IV.,Against the valiant warrior barred
44422,BOOK IV.,The portal which he stood to guard?
44423,BOOK IV.,Can he be grateful--he who took
44424,BOOK IV.,"The hand of Ráma, and forsook"
44425,BOOK IV.,"That friend who saved him in his woes,"
44426,BOOK IV.,To whom his life and fame he owes?
44427,BOOK IV.,"Ah no! his heart is cold and mean,"
44428,BOOK IV.,What bids him search for Ráma's queen?
44429,BOOK IV.,"Not honour's law, not friendship's debt,"
44430,BOOK IV.,But angry Lakshman's timely threat.
44431,BOOK IV.,No prudent heart will ever place
44432,BOOK IV.,"Its trust in one so false and base,"
44433,BOOK IV.,"Who heeds not friendship, kith or kin,"
44434,BOOK IV.,Who scorns the law and cleaves to sin.
44435,BOOK IV.,"But true or false, whate'er he be,"
44436,BOOK IV.,One consequence I clearly see;
44437,BOOK IV.,"Me, in my youth anointed heir"
44438,BOOK IV.,"Against his wish, he will not spare,"
44439,BOOK IV.,But strike with eager hand the blow
44440,BOOK IV.,That rids him of a household foe.
44441,BOOK IV.,"Shall I of power and friends despoiled,"
44442,BOOK IV.,"In all my purpose crossed and foiled,--"
44443,BOOK IV.,"Shall I Kishkindhá seek, and wait,"
44444,BOOK IV.,"Like some poor helpless thing, my fate?"
44445,BOOK IV.,The cruel wretch through lust of sway
44446,BOOK IV.,"Will seize upon his hapless prey,"
44447,BOOK IV.,And to a prison's secret gloom
44448,BOOK IV.,The remnant of my years will doom.
44449,BOOK IV.,'Tis better far to fast and die
44450,BOOK IV.,"Than hopeless bound in chains to lie,"
44451,BOOK IV.,"Your steps, O Vánars, homeward bend"
44452,BOOK IV.,And leave me here my life to end.

44467,BOOK IV.,Then on the ground his limbs he threw

44469,BOOK IV.,And wept as every hope had fled.

44471,BOOK IV.,Down aged cheeks the piteous dew.
44472,BOOK IV.,"And, as the chieftains' eyes grew dim,"

44497,BOOK IV.,"""Behold how Fate with changeless laws"

44503,BOOK IV.,
44504,BOOK IV.,He spoke no more: and Angad heard
44505,BOOK IV.,The menace of the mighty bird;
44506,BOOK IV.,"And thus, while anguish filled his breast,"
44507,BOOK IV.,The noble Hanumán addressed:
44508,BOOK IV.,"""Vivasvat's(762) son has sought this place"
44509,BOOK IV.,For vengeance on the Vánar race.

44524,BOOK IV.,"Blest is Jatáyus, he who gave"

44652,BOOK IV.,
44653,BOOK IV.,Thus King Sampáti spoke and sighed:
44654,BOOK IV.,And royal Angad thus replied:
44655,BOOK IV.,"""If, brother of Jatáyus, thou"
44656,BOOK IV.,"Hast heard the tale I told but now,"
44657,BOOK IV.,Obedient to mine earnest prayer
44658,BOOK IV.,The dwelling of that fiend declare.
44659,BOOK IV.,"O, say where cursed Rávan dwells,"
44660,BOOK IV.,"Whom folly to his death impels."""
44661,BOOK IV.,
44662,BOOK IV.,"He ceased. Again Sampáti spoke,"
44663,BOOK IV.,And hope in every breast awoke:
44664,BOOK IV.,"""Though lost my wings, and strength decayed,"
44665,BOOK IV.,Yet shall my words lend Ráma aid.
44666,BOOK IV.,"I know the worlds where Vishnu trod,(766)"
44667,BOOK IV.,I know the realm of Ocean's God;
44668,BOOK IV.,"How Asurs fought with heavenly foes,"
44669,BOOK IV.,And Amrit from the churning rose.(767)
44670,BOOK IV.,"A mighty task before me lies,"
44671,BOOK IV.,"To prosper Ráma's enterprise,"
44672,BOOK IV.,A task too hard for one whom length
44673,BOOK IV.,Of days has rifled of his strength.
44674,BOOK IV.,I saw the cruel Rávan bear
44675,BOOK IV.,A gentle lady through the air.
44676,BOOK IV.,"Bright was her form, and fresh and young,"
44677,BOOK IV.,And sparkling gems about her hung.
44678,BOOK IV.,"""O Ráma, Ráma!"" cried the dame,"
44679,BOOK IV.,"And shrieked in terror Lakshman's name,"
44680,BOOK IV.,"As, struggling in the giant's hold,"
44681,BOOK IV.,She dropped her gauds of gems and gold.
44682,BOOK IV.,Like sun-light on a mountain shone
44683,BOOK IV.,"The silken garments she had on,"
44684,BOOK IV.,And glistened o'er his swarthy form
44685,BOOK IV.,As lightning flashes through the storm.
44686,BOOK IV.,"That giant Rávan, famed of old,"
44687,BOOK IV.,Is brother of the Lord of Gold.(768)
44688,BOOK IV.,The southern ocean roars and swells
44689,BOOK IV.,"Round Lanká, where the robber dwells"
44690,BOOK IV.,In his fair city nobly planned
44691,BOOK IV.,And built by Visvakarmá's(769) hand.
44692,BOOK IV.,"Within his bower securely barred,"
44693,BOOK IV.,"With monsters round her for a guard,"
44694,BOOK IV.,Still in her silken vesture clad
44695,BOOK IV.,"Lies Sítá, and her heart is sad."
44696,BOOK IV.,A hundred leagues your course must be
44697,BOOK IV.,Beyond this margin of the sea.
44698,BOOK IV.,"Still to the south your way pursue,"
44699,BOOK IV.,And there the giant Rávan view.
44700,BOOK IV.,"Then up, O Vánars, and away!"
44701,BOOK IV.,"For by my heavenly lore I say,"
44702,BOOK IV.,"There will you see the lady's face,"
44703,BOOK IV.,And hither soon your steps retrace.
44704,BOOK IV.,In the first field of air are borne
44705,BOOK IV.,The doves and birds that feed on corn.
44706,BOOK IV.,The second field supports the crows
44707,BOOK IV.,And birds whose food on branches grows.
44708,BOOK IV.,Along the third in balanced flight
44709,BOOK IV.,Sail the keen osprey and the kite.
44710,BOOK IV.,Swift through the fourth the falcon springs
44711,BOOK IV.,The fifth the slower vulture wings.
44712,BOOK IV.,"Up to the sixth the gay swans rise,"

44714,BOOK IV.,"We too, O chiefs, of vulture race,"
44715,BOOK IV.,"Our line from Vinatá may trace,"
44716,BOOK IV.,"Condemned, because we wrought a deed"
44717,BOOK IV.,"Of shame, on flesh and blood to feed."
44718,BOOK IV.,But all Suparna's(771) wondrous powers
44719,BOOK IV.,"And length of keenest sight are ours,"
44720,BOOK IV.,That we a hundred leagues away
44721,BOOK IV.,Through fields of air descry our prey.
44722,BOOK IV.,Now from this spot my gazing eye
44723,BOOK IV.,Can Rávan and the dame descry.
44724,BOOK IV.,Devise some plan to overleap
44725,BOOK IV.,This barrier of the briny deep.
44726,BOOK IV.,"Find the Videhan lady there,"
44727,BOOK IV.,And joyous to your home repair.
44728,BOOK IV.,"Me too, O Vánars, to the side"
44729,BOOK IV.,"Of Varun's(772) home the ocean, guide,"

44753,BOOK IV.,And in what distant prison lies
44754,BOOK IV.,The lady of the long dark eyes.
44755,BOOK IV.,"Scorched by the fiery God of Day,"
44756,BOOK IV.,High on this mighty hill I lay.
44757,BOOK IV.,"A long and weary time had passed,"
44758,BOOK IV.,And strength and life were failing fast.
44759,BOOK IV.,"Yet, ere the breath had left my frame,"
44760,BOOK IV.,"My son, my dear Supársva, came."
44761,BOOK IV.,"Each morn and eve he brought me food,"
44762,BOOK IV.,And filial care my life renewed.
44763,BOOK IV.,"But serpents still are swift to ire,"
44764,BOOK IV.,"Gandharvas slaves to soft desire,"

44767,BOOK IV.,"Once he turned at close of day,"
44768,BOOK IV.,"Stood by my side, but brought no prey."
44769,BOOK IV.,"He looked upon my ravenous eye,"
44770,BOOK IV.,Heard my complaint and made reply:
44771,BOOK IV.,"""Borne on swift wings ere day was light"
44772,BOOK IV.,"I stood upon Mahendra's(773) height,"
44773,BOOK IV.,"And, far below, the sea I viewed"
44774,BOOK IV.,And birds in countless multitude.
44775,BOOK IV.,Before mine eyes a giant flew
44776,BOOK IV.,Whose monstrous form was dark of hue
44777,BOOK IV.,And struggling in his grasp was borne
44778,BOOK IV.,A lady radiant as the morn.
44779,BOOK IV.,"Swift to the south his course he bent,"
44780,BOOK IV.,And cleft the yielding element.
44781,BOOK IV.,The holy spirits of the air
44782,BOOK IV.,"Came round me as I marvelled there,"
44783,BOOK IV.,And cried as their bright legions met:
44784,BOOK IV.,"""O say, is Sítá living yet?"""
44785,BOOK IV.,Thus cried the saints and told the name
44786,BOOK IV.,Of him who held the struggling dame.
44787,BOOK IV.,Then while mine eye with eager look
44788,BOOK IV.,"Pursued the path the robber took,"
44789,BOOK IV.,"I marked the lady's streaming hair,"
44790,BOOK IV.,And heard her cry of wild despair.
44791,BOOK IV.,I saw her silken vesture rent
44792,BOOK IV.,"And stripped of every ornament,"
44793,BOOK IV.,"Thus, O my father, fled the time:"

44812,BOOK IV.,"""Now listen, Prince, while I relate"
44813,BOOK IV.,How first I learned the lady's fate.
44814,BOOK IV.,Burnt by the sun's resistless might
44815,BOOK IV.,I fell and lay on Vindhya's height.
44816,BOOK IV.,"Seven nights in deadly swoon I passed,"
44817,BOOK IV.,But struggling life returned at last.
44818,BOOK IV.,"Around I bent my wondering view,"
44819,BOOK IV.,But every spot was strange and new.
44820,BOOK IV.,"I scanned the sea with eager ken,"
44821,BOOK IV.,"And rock and brook and lake and glen,"
44822,BOOK IV.,"I saw gay trees their branches wave,"
44823,BOOK IV.,And creepers mantling o'er the cave.
44824,BOOK IV.,"I heard the wild birds' joyous song,"
44825,BOOK IV.,"And waters as they foamed along,"
44826,BOOK IV.,And knew the lovely hill must be
44827,BOOK IV.,Mount Vindhya by the southern sea.
44828,BOOK IV.,"Revered by heavenly beings, stood"
44829,BOOK IV.,"Near where I lay, a sacred wood,"
44830,BOOK IV.,Where great Nisakar dwelt of yore
44831,BOOK IV.,And pains of awful penance bore.
44832,BOOK IV.,Eight thousand seasons winged their flight
44833,BOOK IV.,Over the toiling anchorite--
44834,BOOK IV.,"Upon that hill my days were spent,--"
44835,BOOK IV.,And then to heaven the hermit went.
44836,BOOK IV.,"At last, with long and hard assay,"
44837,BOOK IV.,"Down from that height I made my way,"
44838,BOOK IV.,And wandered through the mountain pass
44839,BOOK IV.,Rough with the spikes of Darbha grass.
44840,BOOK IV.,"I with my misery worn, and faint"
44841,BOOK IV.,Was eager to behold the saint:
44842,BOOK IV.,For often with Jatáyus I
44843,BOOK IV.,Had sought his home in days gone by.
44844,BOOK IV.,As nearer to the grove I drew
44845,BOOK IV.,"The breeze with cooling fragrance blew,"
44846,BOOK IV.,"And not a tree that was not fair,"
44847,BOOK IV.,With richest flower and fruit was there.
44848,BOOK IV.,With anxious heart a while I stayed
44849,BOOK IV.,"Beneath the trees' delightful shade,"
44850,BOOK IV.,"And soon the holy hermit, bright"
44851,BOOK IV.,"With fervent penance, came in sight."
44852,BOOK IV.,"Behind him bears and lions, tame"
44853,BOOK IV.,"As those who know their feeder, came,"
44854,BOOK IV.,"And tigers, deer, and snakes pursued"
44855,BOOK IV.,"His steps, a wondrous multitude,"
44856,BOOK IV.,And turned obeisant when the sage
44857,BOOK IV.,Had reached his shady hermitage.
44858,BOOK IV.,Then came Nisakar to my side
44859,BOOK IV.,"And looked with wondering eyes, and cried:"
44860,BOOK IV.,"""I knew thee not, so dire a change"
44861,BOOK IV.,Has made thy form and feature strange.
44862,BOOK IV.,Where are thy glossy feathers? where
44863,BOOK IV.,The rapid wings that cleft the air?

44865,BOOK IV.,Each form at will could they endue.
44866,BOOK IV.,"They of the vulture race were kings,"
44867,BOOK IV.,And flew with Mátarisva's(774) wings.
44868,BOOK IV.,In human shape they loved to greet
44869,BOOK IV.,"Their hermit friend, and clasp his feet."
44870,BOOK IV.,"The younger was Jatáyus, thou"

44884,BOOK IV.,Our strength of flight resolved to try.
44885,BOOK IV.,And by our foolish pride impelled
44886,BOOK IV.,Our way through realms of ether held.
44887,BOOK IV.,We vowed before the saints who tread
44888,BOOK IV.,"The wilds about Kailása's head,"
44889,BOOK IV.,That we with following wings would chase
44890,BOOK IV.,The swift sun to his resting place.
44891,BOOK IV.,Up on our soaring pinions through
44892,BOOK IV.,The fields of cloudless air we flew.
44893,BOOK IV.,"Beneath us far, and far away,"
44894,BOOK IV.,"Like chariot wheels bright cities lay,"
44895,BOOK IV.,Whence in wild snatches rose the song
44896,BOOK IV.,"Of women mid the gay-clad throng,"
44897,BOOK IV.,With sounds of sweetest music blent

44901,BOOK IV.,Beneath us all the earth was seen
44902,BOOK IV.,"Clad in her garb of tender green,"
44903,BOOK IV.,And every river in her bed
44904,BOOK IV.,Meandered like a silver thread.
44905,BOOK IV.,We looked on Meru far below
44906,BOOK IV.,"And Vindhya and the Lord of Snow,"
44907,BOOK IV.,Like elephants that bend to cool
44908,BOOK IV.,Their fever in a lilied pool.

45068,BOOK IV.,
45069,BOOK IV.,"Then passed the weary night, and all"
45070,BOOK IV.,"Assembled at their prince's call,"
45071,BOOK IV.,And every lord of high estate
45072,BOOK IV.,Was gathered round him for debate.
45073,BOOK IV.,Bright was the chieftains' glorious band
45074,BOOK IV.,"Round Angad on the ocean strand,"
45075,BOOK IV.,As when the mighty Storm-Gods meet
45076,BOOK IV.,Round Indra on his golden seat.
45077,BOOK IV.,"Then princely Angad looked on each,"
45078,BOOK IV.,And thus began his prudent speech:
45079,BOOK IV.,"""What chief of all our host will leap"
45080,BOOK IV.,A hundred leagues across the deep?
45081,BOOK IV.,"Who, O illustrious Vánars, who"
45082,BOOK IV.,"Will make Sugríva's promise true,"
45083,BOOK IV.,And from our weight of fear set free
45084,BOOK IV.,The leaders of our band and me?
45085,BOOK IV.,"To whom, O warriors, shall we owe"
45086,BOOK IV.,"A sweet release from pain and woe,"
45087,BOOK IV.,"And proud success, and happy lives"
45088,BOOK IV.,"With our dear children and our wives,"
45089,BOOK IV.,Again permitted by his grace
45090,BOOK IV.,"To look with joy on Ráma's face,"
45091,BOOK IV.,"And noble Lakshman, and our lord"
45092,BOOK IV.,"The king, to our sweet homes restored?"""
45093,BOOK IV.,
45094,BOOK IV.,Thus to the gathered lords he spoke;
45095,BOOK IV.,But no reply the silence broke.
45096,BOOK IV.,Then with a sterner voice he cried:
45097,BOOK IV.,"""O chiefs, the nation's boast and pride,"
45098,BOOK IV.,"Whom valour strength and power adorn,"
45099,BOOK IV.,"Of most illustrious lineage born,"
45100,BOOK IV.,"Where'er you will you force a way,"
45101,BOOK IV.,And none your rapid course can stay.
45102,BOOK IV.,"Now come, your several powers declare."

45109,BOOK IV.,
45110,BOOK IV.,
45111,BOOK IV.,But none of all the host was found
45112,BOOK IV.,"To clear the sea with desperate bound,"
45113,BOOK IV.,"Though each, as Angad bade, declared"
45114,BOOK IV.,His proper power and what he dared.(779)
45115,BOOK IV.,"Then spake good Jámbaván the sage,"
45116,BOOK IV.,Chief of them all for reverend age;
45117,BOOK IV.,"""I, Vánar chieftains, long ago"
45118,BOOK IV.,"Limbs light to leap could likewise show,"
45119,BOOK IV.,But now on frame and spirit weighs
45120,BOOK IV.,The burthen of my length of days.
45121,BOOK IV.,"Still task like this I may not slight,"
45122,BOOK IV.,When Ráma and our king unite.
45123,BOOK IV.,"So listen while I tell, O friends,"
45124,BOOK IV.,What lingering strength mine age attends.
45125,BOOK IV.,"If my poor leap may aught avail,"
45126,BOOK IV.,"Of ninety leagues, I will not fail."
45127,BOOK IV.,Far other strength in youth's fresh prime
45128,BOOK IV.,"I boasted, in the olden time,"
45129,BOOK IV.,"When, at Prahláda's(780) solemn rite,"
45130,BOOK IV.,I circled in my rapid flight
45131,BOOK IV.,"Lord Vishnu, everlasting God,"
45132,BOOK IV.,When through the universe he trod.
45133,BOOK IV.,"But now my limbs are weak and old,"
45134,BOOK IV.,"My youth is fled, its fire is cold,"
45135,BOOK IV.,And these exhausted nerves to strain
45136,BOOK IV.,"In such a task were idle pain."""
45137,BOOK IV.,
45138,BOOK IV.,"Then Angad due obeisance paid,"

45141,BOOK IV.,Myself the mighty leap will try:
45142,BOOK IV.,Although perchance the power I lack
45143,BOOK IV.,"To leap from Lanká's island back."""
45144,BOOK IV.,
45145,BOOK IV.,"Thus the impetuous chieftain cried,"
45146,BOOK IV.,And Jámbaván the sage replied:
45147,BOOK IV.,"""Whate'er thy power and might may be,"
45148,BOOK IV.,"This task, O Prince, is not for thee."
45149,BOOK IV.,"Kings go not forth themselves, but send"

45158,BOOK IV.,Then Báli's noble son replied:

45179,BOOK IV.,"And then to Hanumán, the best"
45180,BOOK IV.,"Of Vánar lords, these words addressed:"
45181,BOOK IV.,"""Why still, and silent, and apart,"
45182,BOOK IV.,O hero of the dauntless heart?
45183,BOOK IV.,Thou keepest treasured in thy mind
45184,BOOK IV.,"The laws that rule the Vánar kind,"
45185,BOOK IV.,"Strong as our king Sugríva, brave"
45186,BOOK IV.,As Ráma's self to slay or save.
45187,BOOK IV.,"Through every land thy praise is heard,"

45189,BOOK IV.,"Aríshtanemi's son,(781) the king"
45190,BOOK IV.,Of every fowl that plies the wing.
45191,BOOK IV.,Oft have I seen the monarch sweep
45192,BOOK IV.,"With sounding pinions o'er the deep,"
45193,BOOK IV.,And in his mighty talons bear
45194,BOOK IV.,Huge serpents struggling through the air.
45195,BOOK IV.,"Thy arms, O hero, match in might"
45196,BOOK IV.,The ample wings he spreads for flight;
45197,BOOK IV.,And thou with him mayest well compare
45198,BOOK IV.,"In power to do, in heart to dare."
45199,BOOK IV.,"Why, rich in wisdom, power, and skill,"
45200,BOOK IV.,"O hero, art thou lingering still?"
45201,BOOK IV.,An Apsaras(782) the fairest found

45207,BOOK IV.,"When, cursed by Gods, from heaven she fell"
45208,BOOK IV.,"In Vánar form on earth to dwell,"
45209,BOOK IV.,New-born in mortal shape the child
45210,BOOK IV.,Of Kunjar monarch of the wild.
45211,BOOK IV.,"In youthful beauty wondrous fair,"
45212,BOOK IV.,"A crown of flowers about her hair,"
45213,BOOK IV.,In silken robes of richest dye
45214,BOOK IV.,She roamed the hills that kiss the sky.
45215,BOOK IV.,Once in her tinted garments dressed
45216,BOOK IV.,"She stood upon the mountain crest,"
45217,BOOK IV.,"The God of Wind beside her came,"
45218,BOOK IV.,And breathed upon the lovely dame.
45219,BOOK IV.,And as he fanned her robe aside
45220,BOOK IV.,The wondrous beauty that he eyed
45221,BOOK IV.,In rounded lines of breast and limb
45222,BOOK IV.,And neck and shoulder ravished him;
45223,BOOK IV.,And captured by her peerless charms
45224,BOOK IV.,He strained her in his amorous arms.
45225,BOOK IV.,Then to the eager God she cried
45226,BOOK IV.,"In trembling accents, terrified:"
45227,BOOK IV.,"""Whose impious love has wronged a spouse"
45228,BOOK IV.,"So constant in her nuptial vows?"""
45229,BOOK IV.,"He heard, and thus his answer made:"
45230,BOOK IV.,"""O, be not troubled, nor afraid,"
45231,BOOK IV.,"But trust, and thou shalt know ere long"
45232,BOOK IV.,"My love has done thee, sweet, no wrong,"
45233,BOOK IV.,So strong and brave and wise shall be
45234,BOOK IV.,The glorious child I give to thee.
45235,BOOK IV.,"Might shall be his that naught can tire,"
45236,BOOK IV.,"And limbs to spring as springs his sire."""
45237,BOOK IV.,Thus spoke the God; the conquered dame
45238,BOOK IV.,Rejoiced in heart nor feared the shame.
45239,BOOK IV.,Down in a cave beneath the earth
45240,BOOK IV.,The happy mother gave thee birth.
45241,BOOK IV.,Once o'er the summit of the wood
45242,BOOK IV.,Before thine eyes the new sun stood.
45243,BOOK IV.,Thou sprangest up in haste to seize
45244,BOOK IV.,What seemed the fruitage of the trees.
45245,BOOK IV.,"Up leapt the child, a wondrous bound,"
45246,BOOK IV.,"Three hundred leagues above the ground,"
45247,BOOK IV.,"And, though the angered Day-God shot"
45248,BOOK IV.,"His fierce beams on him, feared him not."
45249,BOOK IV.,Then from the hand of Indra came
45250,BOOK IV.,A red bolt winged with wrath and flame.
45251,BOOK IV.,"The child fell smitten on a rock,"
45252,BOOK IV.,"His cheek was shattered by the shock,"
45253,BOOK IV.,Named Hanumán(783) thenceforth by all
45254,BOOK IV.,In memory of the fearful fall.
45255,BOOK IV.,The wandering Wind-God saw thee lie
45256,BOOK IV.,"With bleeding cheek and drooping eye,"
45257,BOOK IV.,And stirred to anger by thy woe
45258,BOOK IV.,Forbade each scented breeze to blow.
45259,BOOK IV.,"The breath of all the worlds was stilled,"
45260,BOOK IV.,And the sad Gods with terror filled
45261,BOOK IV.,"Prayed to the Wind, to calm the ire"
45262,BOOK IV.,And soothe the sorrow of the sire.
45263,BOOK IV.,"His fiery wrath no longer glowed,"
45264,BOOK IV.,And Brahmá's self the boon bestowed
45265,BOOK IV.,That in the brunt of battle none
45266,BOOK IV.,Should slay with steel the Wind-God's son.
45267,BOOK IV.,"Lord Indra, sovereign of the skies,"
45268,BOOK IV.,"Bent on thee all his thousand eyes,"
45269,BOOK IV.,And swore that ne'er the bolt which he
45270,BOOK IV.,Hurls from the heaven should injure thee.
45271,BOOK IV.,"'Tis thine, O mighty chief, to share"

45275,BOOK IV.,"This earth of yore, through all her climes,"
45276,BOOK IV.,"I circled one-and-twenty times,"
45277,BOOK IV.,"And gathered, as the Gods decreed,"
45278,BOOK IV.,"Great store of herbs from hill and mead,"
45279,BOOK IV.,"Which, scattered o'er the troubled wave,"
45280,BOOK IV.,The Amrit to the toilers gave.
45281,BOOK IV.,"But now my days are wellnigh told,"
45282,BOOK IV.,"My strength is gone, my limbs are old,"
45283,BOOK IV.,"And thou, the bravest and the best,"
45284,BOOK IV.,Art the sure hope of all the rest.
45285,BOOK IV.,"Now, mighty chief, the task assay:"
45286,BOOK IV.,Thy matchless power and strength display.
45287,BOOK IV.,"Rise up, O prince, our second king,"
45288,BOOK IV.,And o'er the flood of ocean spring.
45289,BOOK IV.,So shall the glorious exploit vie
45290,BOOK IV.,"With his who stepped through earth and sky.""(784)"
45291,BOOK IV.,
45292,BOOK IV.,"He spoke: the younger chieftain heard,"
45293,BOOK IV.,"His soul to vigorous effort stirred,"

45307,BOOK IV.,On the great chief their eyes they bent
45308,BOOK IV.,"In rapture and astonishment,"
45309,BOOK IV.,"As, when his conquering foot he raised,"
45310,BOOK IV.,The Gods upon Náráyan(785) gazed.
45311,BOOK IV.,"He stood amid the joyous crowd,"
45312,BOOK IV.,"Bent to the chiefs, and cried aloud:"
45313,BOOK IV.,"""The Wind-God, Fire's eternal friend,"

45317,BOOK IV.,"Sprung from that glorious father, I"
45318,BOOK IV.,"In power and speed with him may vie,"
45319,BOOK IV.,A thousand times with airy leap
45320,BOOK IV.,Can circle loftiest Meru's steep:
45321,BOOK IV.,With my fierce arms can stir the sea
45322,BOOK IV.,Till from their bed the waters flee
45323,BOOK IV.,And rush at my command to drown
45324,BOOK IV.,This land with grove and tower and town.
45325,BOOK IV.,I through the fields of air can spring
45326,BOOK IV.,"Far swifter than the feathered King,"
45327,BOOK IV.,"And leap before him as he flies,"
45328,BOOK IV.,On sounding pinions through the skies.
45329,BOOK IV.,I can pursue the Lord of Light
45330,BOOK IV.,"Uprising from the eastern height,"

45336,BOOK IV.,"And every flower that grows on ground,"
45337,BOOK IV.,And bloom of climbing plants shall show
45338,BOOK IV.,"Strewn on the ground, the way I go,"
45339,BOOK IV.,Bright as the lustrous path that lies
45340,BOOK IV.,Athwart the region of the skies.(786)
45341,BOOK IV.,"The Maithil lady will I find,--"
45342,BOOK IV.,"Thus speaks mine own prophetic mind,--"
45343,BOOK IV.,And cast in hideous ruin down

45345,BOOK IV.,
45346,BOOK IV.,Still on the chief in rapt surprise
45347,BOOK IV.,"The Vánar legions bent their eyes,"
45348,BOOK IV.,And thus again sage Jámbaván
45349,BOOK IV.,Addressed the glorious Hanumán:
45350,BOOK IV.,"""Son of the Wind, thy promise cheers"
45351,BOOK IV.,"The Vánars' hearts, and calms their fears,"
45352,BOOK IV.,"Who, rescued from their dire distress,"
45353,BOOK IV.,With prospering vows thy way will bless.
45354,BOOK IV.,"The holy saints their favour lend,"
45355,BOOK IV.,And all our chiefs the deed commend

45361,BOOK IV.,Then sprang the Wind-God's son the best

45363,BOOK IV.,And the great mountain rocked and swayed
45364,BOOK IV.,"By that unusual weight dismayed,"

45409,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar wandered with delight.
45410,BOOK V.(787),"Then, standing on the flowery sod,"
45411,BOOK V.(787),He paid his vows to saint and God.

45420,BOOK V.(787),And if she be not there will fly
45421,BOOK V.(787),And seek the lady in the sky;
45422,BOOK V.(787),"Or, if in heaven she be not found,"
45423,BOOK V.(787),"Will hither bring the giant bound."""
45424,BOOK V.(787),
45425,BOOK V.(787),He ceased; and mustering his might
45426,BOOK V.(787),"Sprang downward from the mountain height,"
45427,BOOK V.(787),"While, shattered by each mighty limb,"
45428,BOOK V.(787),The trees unrooted followed him.
45429,BOOK V.(787),The shadow on the ocean cast
45430,BOOK V.(787),"By his vast form, as on he passed,"
45431,BOOK V.(787),Flew like a ship before the gale
45432,BOOK V.(787),"When the strong breeze has filled the sail,"
45433,BOOK V.(787),And where his course the Vánar held
45434,BOOK V.(787),The sea beneath him raged and swelled.
45435,BOOK V.(787),Then Gods and all the heavenly train
45436,BOOK V.(787),Poured flowerets down in gentle rain;
45437,BOOK V.(787),"Their voices glad Gandharvas raised,"
45438,BOOK V.(787),And saints in heaven the Vánar praised.

45463,BOOK V.(787),"As bursts the sun from autumn cloud,"
45464,BOOK V.(787),"Rose swifty, crowned with plant and tree,"
45465,BOOK V.(787),And stood above the foamy sea.(790)
45466,BOOK V.(787),There with his lofty peaks upraised
45467,BOOK V.(787),"Bright as a hundred suns he blazed,"
45468,BOOK V.(787),And crest and crag of burnished gold
45469,BOOK V.(787),Flashed on the flood that round him rolled.
45470,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar thought the mountain rose
45471,BOOK V.(787),"A hostile bar to interpose,"
45472,BOOK V.(787),"And, like a wind-swept cloud, o'erthrew"
45473,BOOK V.(787),The glittering mountain as he flew.
45474,BOOK V.(787),Then from the falling hill rang out
45475,BOOK V.(787),A warning voice and joyful shout.
45476,BOOK V.(787),Again he raised him high in air
45477,BOOK V.(787),"To meet the flying Vánar there,"
45478,BOOK V.(787),And standing on his topmost peak
45479,BOOK V.(787),In human form began to speak:(791)
45480,BOOK V.(787),"""Best of the Vánars' noblest line,"
45481,BOOK V.(787),"A mighty task, O chief, is thine."
45482,BOOK V.(787),"Here for a while, I pray thee, light"
45483,BOOK V.(787),And rest upon the breezy height.
45484,BOOK V.(787),A prince of Raghu's line was he
45485,BOOK V.(787),"Who gave his glory to the Sea,(792)"
45486,BOOK V.(787),Who now to Ráma's envoy shows
45487,BOOK V.(787),High honour for the debt he owes.
45488,BOOK V.(787),He bade me lift my buried head
45489,BOOK V.(787),"Uprising from my watery bed,"
45490,BOOK V.(787),And woo the Vánar chief to rest
45491,BOOK V.(787),A moment on my glittering crest.
45492,BOOK V.(787),"Refresh thy weary limbs, and eat"
45493,BOOK V.(787),My mountain fruits for they are sweet.
45494,BOOK V.(787),"I too, O chieftain, know thee well;"
45495,BOOK V.(787),Three worlds thy famous virtues tell;
45496,BOOK V.(787),"And none, I ween, with thee may vie"
45497,BOOK V.(787),Who spring impetuous through the sky.
45498,BOOK V.(787),"To every guest, though mean and low."
45499,BOOK V.(787),The wise respect and honour show;
45500,BOOK V.(787),"And how shall I neglect thee, how"
45501,BOOK V.(787),Slight the great guest so near me now?
45502,BOOK V.(787),"Son of the Wind, 'tis thine to share"
45503,BOOK V.(787),The might of him who shakes the air;
45504,BOOK V.(787),"And,--for he loves his offspring,--he"
45505,BOOK V.(787),Is honoured when I honour thee.
45506,BOOK V.(787),"Of yore, when Krita's age(793) was new,"
45507,BOOK V.(787),The little hills and mountains flew
45508,BOOK V.(787),"Where'er they listed, borne on wings"
45509,BOOK V.(787),More rapid than the feathered king's.(794)
45510,BOOK V.(787),But mighty terror came on all
45511,BOOK V.(787),The Gods and saints who feared their fall.
45512,BOOK V.(787),And Indra in his anger rent
45513,BOOK V.(787),Their pinions with the bolts he sent.
45514,BOOK V.(787),When in his ruthless fury he
45515,BOOK V.(787),"Levelled his flashing bolt at me,"
45516,BOOK V.(787),"The great-souled Wind inclined to save,"
45517,BOOK V.(787),And laid me neath the ocean's wave.
45518,BOOK V.(787),Thus by the favour of the sire
45519,BOOK V.(787),I kept my cherished wings entire;
45520,BOOK V.(787),And for this deed of kindness done
45521,BOOK V.(787),I honour thee his noble son.
45522,BOOK V.(787),"O come, thy weary limbs relieve,"
45523,BOOK V.(787),"And honour due from me receive."""
45524,BOOK V.(787),"""I may not rest,"" the Vánar cried;"
45525,BOOK V.(787),"""I must not stay or turn aside."
45526,BOOK V.(787),"Yet pleased am I, thou noblest hill,"
45527,BOOK V.(787),"And as the deed accept thy will."""
45528,BOOK V.(787),
45529,BOOK V.(787),Thus as he spoke he lightly pressed
45530,BOOK V.(787),"With his broad hand the mountain's crest,"
45531,BOOK V.(787),Then bounded upward to the height
45532,BOOK V.(787),"Of heaven, rejoicing in his might,"
45533,BOOK V.(787),"And through the fields of boundless blue,"
45534,BOOK V.(787),"The pathway of his father, flew."
45535,BOOK V.(787),"Gods, saints, and heavenly bards beheld"
45536,BOOK V.(787),"That flight that none had paralleled,"
45537,BOOK V.(787),Then to the Nágas' mother(795) came
45538,BOOK V.(787),And thus addressed the sun-bright dame:
45539,BOOK V.(787),"""See, Hanumán with venturous leap"
45540,BOOK V.(787),"Would spring across the mighty deep,--"
45541,BOOK V.(787),"A Vánar prince, the Wind-God's seed:"
45542,BOOK V.(787),"Come, Surasá, his course impede."
45543,BOOK V.(787),"In Rákshas form thy shape disguise,"
45544,BOOK V.(787),"Terrific, like a hill in size:"
45545,BOOK V.(787),"Let thy red eyes with fury glow,"
45546,BOOK V.(787),And high as heaven thy body grow.
45547,BOOK V.(787),"With fearful tusks the chief defy,"
45548,BOOK V.(787),That we his power and strength may try.
45549,BOOK V.(787),"He will with guile thy hold elude,"
45550,BOOK V.(787),"Or own thy might, by thee subdued."""
45551,BOOK V.(787),
45552,BOOK V.(787),"Pleased with the grateful honours paid,"
45553,BOOK V.(787),"The godlike dame their words obeyed,"
45554,BOOK V.(787),Clad in a shape of terror she
45555,BOOK V.(787),"Sprang from the middle of the sea,"
45556,BOOK V.(787),"And, with fierce accents that appalled"
45557,BOOK V.(787),"All creatures, to the Vánar called:"
45558,BOOK V.(787),"""Come, prince of Vánars, doomed to be"
45559,BOOK V.(787),My food this day by heaven's decree.
45560,BOOK V.(787),Such boon from ages long ago
45561,BOOK V.(787),"To Brahmá's favouring will I owe."""
45562,BOOK V.(787),
45563,BOOK V.(787),"She ceased, and Hanumán replied,"
45564,BOOK V.(787),By shape and threat unterrified:
45565,BOOK V.(787),"""Brave Ráma with his Maithil spouse"
45566,BOOK V.(787),"Lodged in the shade of Dandak's boughs,"
45567,BOOK V.(787),Thence Rávan king of giants stole
45568,BOOK V.(787),Sítá the joy of Ráma's soul.
45569,BOOK V.(787),By Ráma's high behest to her
45570,BOOK V.(787),I go a willing messenger;
45571,BOOK V.(787),And never shouldst them hinder one
45572,BOOK V.(787),Who toils for Dasaratha's son.
45573,BOOK V.(787),"First captive Sítá will I see,"
45574,BOOK V.(787),"And him who sent and waits for me,"
45575,BOOK V.(787),"Then come and to thy will submit,"
45576,BOOK V.(787),"Yea, by my truth I promise it."""
45577,BOOK V.(787),"""Nay, hope not thus thy life to save;"
45578,BOOK V.(787),Not such the boon that Brahmá gave.
45579,BOOK V.(787),"Enter my mouth,"" was her reply,"
45580,BOOK V.(787),"""Then forward on thy journey hie!""(796)"
45581,BOOK V.(787),
45582,BOOK V.(787),"""Stretch, wider stretch thy jaws,"" exclaimed"
45583,BOOK V.(787),"The Vánar chief, to ire inflamed;"
45584,BOOK V.(787),"And, as the Rákshas near him drew,"
45585,BOOK V.(787),Ten leagues in height his stature grew.
45586,BOOK V.(787),"Then straight, her threatening jaws between,"
45587,BOOK V.(787),A gulf of twenty leagues was seen.
45588,BOOK V.(787),"To fifty leagues he waxed, and still"
45589,BOOK V.(787),Her mouth grew wider at her will.
45590,BOOK V.(787),"Then smaller than a thumb became,"
45591,BOOK V.(787),"Shrunk by his power, the Vánar's frame.(797)"
45592,BOOK V.(787),"He leaped within, and turning round"
45593,BOOK V.(787),Sprang through the portal at a bound.
45594,BOOK V.(787),"Then hung in air a moment, while"
45595,BOOK V.(787),He thus addressed her with a smile:
45596,BOOK V.(787),"""O Daksha's child,(798) farewell at last!"
45597,BOOK V.(787),For I within thy mouth have passed.
45598,BOOK V.(787),Thou hast the gift of Brahmá's grace:
45599,BOOK V.(787),"I go, the Maithil queen to trace."""
45600,BOOK V.(787),"Then, to her former shape restored,"
45601,BOOK V.(787),She thus addressed the Vánar lord:
45602,BOOK V.(787),"""Then forward to the task, and may"
45603,BOOK V.(787),Success and joy attend thy way!
45604,BOOK V.(787),"Go, and the rescued lady bring"
45605,BOOK V.(787),"In triumph to her lord and king."""
45606,BOOK V.(787),
45607,BOOK V.(787),Then hosts of spirits as they gazed
45608,BOOK V.(787),The daring of the Vánar praised.
45609,BOOK V.(787),"Through the broad fields of ether, fast"
45610,BOOK V.(787),"Garud's royal self, he passed,"
45611,BOOK V.(787),"The region of the cloud and rain,"
45612,BOOK V.(787),"Loved by the gay Gandharva train,"
45613,BOOK V.(787),Where mid the birds that came and went
45614,BOOK V.(787),"Shone Indra's glorious bow unbent,"
45615,BOOK V.(787),And like a host of wandering stars
45616,BOOK V.(787),Flashed the high Gods' celestial cars.
45617,BOOK V.(787),Fierce Sinhiká(799) who joyed in ill
45618,BOOK V.(787),"And changed her form to work her will,"
45619,BOOK V.(787),Descried him on his airy way
45620,BOOK V.(787),And marked the Vánar for her prey.
45621,BOOK V.(787),"""This day at length,"" the demon cried,"
45622,BOOK V.(787),"""My hunger shall be satisfied,"""
45623,BOOK V.(787),And at his passing shadow caught
45624,BOOK V.(787),Delighted with the cheering thought.
45625,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar felt the power that stayed
45626,BOOK V.(787),"And held him as she grasped his shade,"
45627,BOOK V.(787),Like some tall ship upon the main
45628,BOOK V.(787),That struggles with the wind in vain.
45629,BOOK V.(787),"Below, above, his eye he bent"
45630,BOOK V.(787),And scanned the sea and firmament.
45631,BOOK V.(787),High from the briny deep upreared
45632,BOOK V.(787),"The monster's hideous form appeared,"
45633,BOOK V.(787),"""Sugríva's tale,"" he cried, ""is true:"
45634,BOOK V.(787),This is the demon dire to view
45635,BOOK V.(787),"Of whom the Vánar monarch told,"
45636,BOOK V.(787),"Whose grasp a passing shade can hold."""
45637,BOOK V.(787),"Then, as a cloud in rain-time grows"
45638,BOOK V.(787),"His form, dilating, swelled and rose."
45639,BOOK V.(787),Wide as the space from heaven to hell
45640,BOOK V.(787),"Her jaws she opened with a yell,"
45641,BOOK V.(787),And rushed upon her fancied prey
45642,BOOK V.(787),With cloud-like roar to seize and slay.
45643,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar swift as thought compressed
45644,BOOK V.(787),"His borrowed bulk of limb and chest,"
45645,BOOK V.(787),And stood with one quick bound inside
45646,BOOK V.(787),The monstrous mouth she opened wide.
45647,BOOK V.(787),Hid like the moon when Ráhu draws
45648,BOOK V.(787),The orb within his ravening jaws.
45649,BOOK V.(787),Within that ample cavern pent
45650,BOOK V.(787),"The demon's form he tore and rent,"
45651,BOOK V.(787),"And, from the mangled carcass freed,"
45652,BOOK V.(787),Came forth again with thought-like speed.(800)
45653,BOOK V.(787),"Thus with his skill the fiend he slew,"
45654,BOOK V.(787),Then to his wonted stature grew.
45655,BOOK V.(787),The spirits saw the demon die
45656,BOOK V.(787),And hailed the Vánar from the sky:
45657,BOOK V.(787),"""Well hast thou fought a wondrous fight"
45658,BOOK V.(787),"Nor spared the fiend's terrific might,"
45659,BOOK V.(787),"On, on! perform the blameless deed,"
45660,BOOK V.(787),And in thine every wish succeed.
45661,BOOK V.(787),Ne'er can they fail in whom combine
45662,BOOK V.(787),"Such valour, thought, and skill as thine."""
45663,BOOK V.(787),
45664,BOOK V.(787),"Pleased with their praises as they sang,"
45665,BOOK V.(787),"Again through fields of air he sprang,"
45666,BOOK V.(787),"And now, his travail wellnigh done,"
45667,BOOK V.(787),The distant shore was almost won.
45668,BOOK V.(787),Before him on the margent stood
45669,BOOK V.(787),"In long dark line a waving wood,"
45670,BOOK V.(787),"And the fair island, bright and green"
45671,BOOK V.(787),"With flowers and trees, was clearly seen,"
45672,BOOK V.(787),And every babbling brook that gave
45673,BOOK V.(787),Her lord the sea a tribute wave.
45674,BOOK V.(787),He lighted down on Lamba's peak
45675,BOOK V.(787),"Which tinted metals stain and streak,"
45676,BOOK V.(787),And looked where Lanká's splendid town
45677,BOOK V.(787),Shone on the mountain like a crown.
45678,BOOK V.(787),
45679,BOOK V.(787),
45680,BOOK V.(787),
45681,BOOK V.(787),
45682,BOOK V.(787),Canto II. Lanká.
45683,BOOK V.(787),
45684,BOOK V.(787),
45685,BOOK V.(787),"The glorious sight a while he viewed,"
45686,BOOK V.(787),Then to the town his way pursued.
45687,BOOK V.(787),Around the Vánar as he went
45688,BOOK V.(787),"Breathed from the wood delicious scent,"
45689,BOOK V.(787),And the soft grass beneath his feet
45690,BOOK V.(787),With gem-like flowers was bright and sweet.
45691,BOOK V.(787),Still as the Vánar nearer drew
45692,BOOK V.(787),More clearly rose the town to view.
45693,BOOK V.(787),"The palm her fan-like leaves displayed,"
45694,BOOK V.(787),"Priyálas(801) lent their pleasant shade,"
45695,BOOK V.(787),And mid the lower greenery far
45696,BOOK V.(787),Conspicuous rose the Kovidár.(802)
45697,BOOK V.(787),A thousand trees mid flowers that glowed
45698,BOOK V.(787),"Hung down their fruit's delicious load,(803)"
45699,BOOK V.(787),And in their crests that rocked and swayed
45700,BOOK V.(787),Sweet birds delightful music made.
45701,BOOK V.(787),And there were pleasant pools whereon
45702,BOOK V.(787),The glories of the lotus shone;
45703,BOOK V.(787),"And gleams of sparkling fountains, stirred"
45704,BOOK V.(787),By many a joyous water-bird.
45705,BOOK V.(787),"Around, in lovely gardens grew"
45706,BOOK V.(787),"Blooms sweet of scent and bright of hue,"
45707,BOOK V.(787),"And Lanká, seat of Rávan's sway,"
45708,BOOK V.(787),Before the wondering Vánar lay:
45709,BOOK V.(787),"With stately domes and turrets tall,"
45710,BOOK V.(787),"Encircled by a golden wall,"
45711,BOOK V.(787),And moats whose waters were aglow
45712,BOOK V.(787),With lily blossoms bright below:
45713,BOOK V.(787),For Sítá's sake defended well
45714,BOOK V.(787),"With bolt and bar and sentinel,"
45715,BOOK V.(787),And Rákshases who roamed in bands
45716,BOOK V.(787),With ready bows in eager hands.
45717,BOOK V.(787),He saw the stately mansions rise
45718,BOOK V.(787),Like pale-hued clouds in autumn skies;
45719,BOOK V.(787),"Where noble streets were broad and bright,"
45720,BOOK V.(787),And banners waved on every height.
45721,BOOK V.(787),Her gates were glorious to behold
45722,BOOK V.(787),Rich with the shine of burnished gold:
45723,BOOK V.(787),A lovely city planned and decked
45724,BOOK V.(787),"By heaven's creative architect,(804)"
45725,BOOK V.(787),Fairest of earthly cities meet
45726,BOOK V.(787),To be the Gods' celestial seat.
45727,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar by the northern gate
45728,BOOK V.(787),Thus in his heart began debate
45729,BOOK V.(787),"""Our mightiest host would strive in vain"
45730,BOOK V.(787),To take this city on the main:
45731,BOOK V.(787),A city that may well defy
45732,BOOK V.(787),The chosen warriors of the sky;
45733,BOOK V.(787),A city never to be won
45734,BOOK V.(787),E'en by the arm of Raghu's son.
45735,BOOK V.(787),Here is no hope by guile to win
45736,BOOK V.(787),The hostile hearts of those within.
45737,BOOK V.(787),"'Twere vain to war, or bribe, or sow"
45738,BOOK V.(787),Dissension mid the Vánar foe.
45739,BOOK V.(787),But now my search must I pursue
45740,BOOK V.(787),Until the Maithil queen I view:
45741,BOOK V.(787),"And, when I find the captive dame,"
45742,BOOK V.(787),Make victory mine only aim.
45743,BOOK V.(787),"But, if I wear my present shape,"
45744,BOOK V.(787),How shall I enter and escape
45745,BOOK V.(787),"The Rákshas troops, their guards and spies,"
45746,BOOK V.(787),And sleepless watch of cruel eyes?
45747,BOOK V.(787),The fiends of giant race who hold
45748,BOOK V.(787),This mighty town are strong and bold;
45749,BOOK V.(787),And I must labour to elude
45750,BOOK V.(787),The fiercely watchful multitude.
45751,BOOK V.(787),I in a shape to mock their sight
45752,BOOK V.(787),"Must steal within the town by night,"
45753,BOOK V.(787),"Blind with my art the demons' eyes,"
45754,BOOK V.(787),And thus achieve my enterprise.
45755,BOOK V.(787),"How may I see, myself unseen"
45756,BOOK V.(787),"Of the fierce king, the captive queen,"
45757,BOOK V.(787),"And meet her in some lonely place,"
45758,BOOK V.(787),"With none beside her, face to face?"""
45759,BOOK V.(787),
45760,BOOK V.(787),When the bright sun had left the skies
45761,BOOK V.(787),"The Vánar dwarfed his mighty size,"
45762,BOOK V.(787),"And, in the straitest bounds restrained,"
45763,BOOK V.(787),The bigness of a cat retained.(805)
45764,BOOK V.(787),"Then, when the moon's soft light was spread,"
45765,BOOK V.(787),Within the city's walls he sped.

45772,BOOK V.(787),
45773,BOOK V.(787),There from the circling rampart's height
45774,BOOK V.(787),He gazed upon the wondrous sight;
45775,BOOK V.(787),"Broad gates with burnished gold displayed,"
45776,BOOK V.(787),And courts with turkises inlaid;
45777,BOOK V.(787),"With gleaming silver, gems, and rows"
45778,BOOK V.(787),Of crystal stairs and porticoes.
45779,BOOK V.(787),In semblance of a Rákshas dame
45780,BOOK V.(787),"The city's guardian Goddess came,--"
45781,BOOK V.(787),For she with glances sure and keen
45782,BOOK V.(787),"The entrance of a foe had seen,--"
45783,BOOK V.(787),And thus with fury in her eye
45784,BOOK V.(787),Addressed him with an angry cry:
45785,BOOK V.(787),"""Who art thou? what has led thee, say,"
45786,BOOK V.(787),Within these walls to find thy way?
45787,BOOK V.(787),Thou mayst not enter here in spite

45792,BOOK V.(787),"And chid me thus infuriate?"""
45793,BOOK V.(787),
45794,BOOK V.(787),He ceased: and Lanká made reply:

46143,BOOK V.(787),Of the wild elephant has spread
46144,BOOK V.(787),"Confusion and destruction round,"
46145,BOOK V.(787),And cast it flowerless to the ground.
46146,BOOK V.(787),"Here lay a slumberer still as death,"
46147,BOOK V.(787),Save only that her balmy breath
46148,BOOK V.(787),Raised ever and anon the lace
46149,BOOK V.(787),That floated o'er her sleeping face.
46150,BOOK V.(787),"There, sunk in sleep, an amorous maid"
46151,BOOK V.(787),"Her sweet head on a mirror laid,"
46152,BOOK V.(787),Like a fair lily bending till
46153,BOOK V.(787),Her petals rest upon the rill.
46154,BOOK V.(787),Another black-eyed damsel pressed
46155,BOOK V.(787),"Her lute upon her heaving breast,"
46156,BOOK V.(787),As though her loving arms were twined
46157,BOOK V.(787),Round him for whom her bosom pined.
46158,BOOK V.(787),Another pretty sleeper round
46159,BOOK V.(787),"A silver vase her arms had wound,"
46160,BOOK V.(787),"That seemed, so fresh and fair and young"
46161,BOOK V.(787),A wreath of flowers that o'er it hung.
46162,BOOK V.(787),In sweet disorder lay a throng
46163,BOOK V.(787),"Weary of dance and play and song,"
46164,BOOK V.(787),Where heedless girls had sunk to rest
46165,BOOK V.(787),"One pillowed on another's breast,"
46166,BOOK V.(787),Her tender cheek half seen beneath
46167,BOOK V.(787),"Bed roses of the falling wreath,"
46168,BOOK V.(787),The while her long soft hair concealed
46169,BOOK V.(787),The beauties that her friend revealed.
46170,BOOK V.(787),With limbs at random interlaced
46171,BOOK V.(787),"Round arm and leg and throat and waist,"
46172,BOOK V.(787),That wreath of women lay asleep
46173,BOOK V.(787),Like blossoms in a careless heap.

46181,BOOK V.(787),Apart a dais of crystal rose
46182,BOOK V.(787),"With couches spread for soft repose,"
46183,BOOK V.(787),Adorned with gold and gems of price
46184,BOOK V.(787),Meet for the halls of Paradise.
46185,BOOK V.(787),A canopy was o'er them spread
46186,BOOK V.(787),"Pale as the light the moon beams shed,"
46187,BOOK V.(787),"And female figures,(816) deftly planned,"
46188,BOOK V.(787),"The faces of the sleepers fanned,"
46189,BOOK V.(787),"There on a splendid couch, asleep"
46190,BOOK V.(787),On softest skins of deer and sheep.
46191,BOOK V.(787),Dark as a cloud that dims the day
46192,BOOK V.(787),"The monarch of the giants lay,"
46193,BOOK V.(787),Perfumed with sandal's precious scent
46194,BOOK V.(787),And gay with golden ornament.
46195,BOOK V.(787),"His fiery eyes in slumber closed,"
46196,BOOK V.(787),In glittering robes the king reposed
46197,BOOK V.(787),Like Mandar's mighty hill asleep
46198,BOOK V.(787),With flowery trees that clothe his steep.
46199,BOOK V.(787),Near and more near the Vánar
46200,BOOK V.(787),"The monarch of the fiends to view,"
46201,BOOK V.(787),And saw the giant stretched supine
46202,BOOK V.(787),Fatigued with play and drunk with wine.
46203,BOOK V.(787),"While, shaking all the monstrous frame,"
46204,BOOK V.(787),His breath like hissing serpents' came.
46205,BOOK V.(787),With gold and glittering bracelets gay
46206,BOOK V.(787),His mighty arms extended lay
46207,BOOK V.(787),Huge as the towering shafts that bear
46208,BOOK V.(787),The flag of Indra high in air.
46209,BOOK V.(787),Scars by Airávat's tusk impressed
46210,BOOK V.(787),Showed red upon his shaggy breast.
46211,BOOK V.(787),And on his shoulders were displayed
46212,BOOK V.(787),The dints the thunder-bolt had made.(817)
46213,BOOK V.(787),The spouses of the giant king
46214,BOOK V.(787),"Around their lord were slumbering,"
46215,BOOK V.(787),"And, gay with sparkling earrings, shone"
46216,BOOK V.(787),Fair as the moon to look upon.
46217,BOOK V.(787),There by her husband's side was seen
46218,BOOK V.(787),"Mandodarí the favourite queen,"
46219,BOOK V.(787),The beauty of whose youthful face
46220,BOOK V.(787),Beamed a soft glory through the place.
46221,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar marked the dame more fair
46222,BOOK V.(787),"Than all the royal ladies there,"
46223,BOOK V.(787),"And thought, ""These rarest beauties speak"
46224,BOOK V.(787),The matchless dame I come to seek.
46225,BOOK V.(787),"Peerless in grace and splendour, she"
46226,BOOK V.(787),"The Maithil queen must surely be."""

46232,BOOK V.(787),
46233,BOOK V.(787),
46234,BOOK V.(787),But soon the baseless thought was spurned
46235,BOOK V.(787),And longing hope again returned:
46236,BOOK V.(787),"""No: Ráma's wife is none of these,"
46237,BOOK V.(787),No careless dame that lives at ease.
46238,BOOK V.(787),Her widowed heart has ceased to care
46239,BOOK V.(787),For dress and sleep and dainty fare.
46240,BOOK V.(787),She near a lover ne'er would lie
46241,BOOK V.(787),Though Indra wooed her from the sky.
46242,BOOK V.(787),"Her own, her only lord, whom none"
46243,BOOK V.(787),"Can match in heaven, is Raghu's son."""
46244,BOOK V.(787),
46245,BOOK V.(787),Then to the banquet hall intent
46246,BOOK V.(787),On strictest search his steps he bent.
46247,BOOK V.(787),"He passed within the door, and found"
46248,BOOK V.(787),"Fair women sleeping on the ground,"
46249,BOOK V.(787),"Where wearied with the song, perchance,"
46250,BOOK V.(787),"The merry game, the wanton dance,"
46251,BOOK V.(787),Each girl with wine and sleep oppressed
46252,BOOK V.(787),Had sunk her drooping head to rest.
46253,BOOK V.(787),That spacious hall from side to side
46254,BOOK V.(787),"With noblest fare was well supplied,"
46255,BOOK V.(787),"There quarters of the boar, and here"
46256,BOOK V.(787),"Roast of the buffalo and deer,"
46257,BOOK V.(787),"There on gold plate, untouched as yet"
46258,BOOK V.(787),The peacock and the hen were set.
46259,BOOK V.(787),There deftly mixed with salt and curd
46260,BOOK V.(787),"Was meat of many a beast and bird,"
46261,BOOK V.(787),"Of kid and porcupine and hare,"
46262,BOOK V.(787),And dainties of the sea and air.
46263,BOOK V.(787),"There wrought of gold, ablaze with shine"
46264,BOOK V.(787),"Of precious stones, were cups of wine."
46265,BOOK V.(787),Through court and bower and banquet hall
46266,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar passed and viewed them all;
46267,BOOK V.(787),"From end to end, in every spot,"
46268,BOOK V.(787),"For Sítá searched, but found her not."

46274,BOOK V.(787),
46275,BOOK V.(787),
46276,BOOK V.(787),Again the Vánar chief began
46277,BOOK V.(787),"Each chamber, bower, and hall to scan."
46278,BOOK V.(787),"In vain: he found not her he sought,"
46279,BOOK V.(787),And pondered thus in bitter thought:
46280,BOOK V.(787),"""Ah me the Maithil queen is slain:"
46281,BOOK V.(787),"She, ever true and free from stain,"
46282,BOOK V.(787),"The fiend's entreaty has denied,"
46283,BOOK V.(787),And by his cruel hand has died.
46284,BOOK V.(787),"Or has she sunk, by terror killed,"
46285,BOOK V.(787),When first she saw the palace filled
46286,BOOK V.(787),With female monsters evil miened
46287,BOOK V.(787),Who wait upon the robber fiend?
46288,BOOK V.(787),"No battle fought, no might displayed,"
46289,BOOK V.(787),In vain this anxious search is made;
46290,BOOK V.(787),"Nor shall my steps, made slow by shame,"
46291,BOOK V.(787),"Because I failed to find the dame,"
46292,BOOK V.(787),"Back to our lord the king be bent,"
46293,BOOK V.(787),For he is swift to punishment.
46294,BOOK V.(787),"In every bower my feet have been,"
46295,BOOK V.(787),The dames of Rávan have I seen;
46296,BOOK V.(787),"But Ráma's spouse I seek in vain,"
46297,BOOK V.(787),And all my toil is fruitless pain.
46298,BOOK V.(787),How shall I meet the Vánar band
46299,BOOK V.(787),I left upon the ocean strand?
46300,BOOK V.(787),"How, when they bid me speak, proclaim"
46301,BOOK V.(787),These tidings of defeat and shame?
46302,BOOK V.(787),How shall I look on Angad's eye?
46303,BOOK V.(787),What words will Jámbaván reply?
46304,BOOK V.(787),Yet dauntless hearts will never fail
46305,BOOK V.(787),"To win success though foes assail,"
46306,BOOK V.(787),And I this sorrow will subdue
46307,BOOK V.(787),"And search the palace through and through,"
46308,BOOK V.(787),Exploring with my cautious tread
46309,BOOK V.(787),"Each spot as yet unvisited."""
46310,BOOK V.(787),
46311,BOOK V.(787),Again he turned him to explore
46312,BOOK V.(787),"Each chamber, hall, and corridor,"
46313,BOOK V.(787),"And arbour bright with scented bloom,"
46314,BOOK V.(787),And lodge and cell and picture-room.
46315,BOOK V.(787),With eager eye and noiseless feet
46316,BOOK V.(787),He passed through many a cool retreat
46317,BOOK V.(787),Where women lay in slumber drowned;
46318,BOOK V.(787),But Sítá still was nowhere found.

46324,BOOK V.(787),
46325,BOOK V.(787),
46326,BOOK V.(787),Then rapid as the lightning's flame
46327,BOOK V.(787),From Rávan's halls the Vánar came.
46328,BOOK V.(787),"Each lingering hope was cold and dead,"
46329,BOOK V.(787),And thus within his heart he said:
46330,BOOK V.(787),"""Alas, my fruitless search is done:"
46331,BOOK V.(787),Long have I toiled for Raghu's son;
46332,BOOK V.(787),And yet with all my care have seen
46333,BOOK V.(787),No traces of the ravished queen.

46337,BOOK V.(787),"Slipped struggling from the robber's hold,"
46338,BOOK V.(787),And the wild sea is rolling now
46339,BOOK V.(787),O'er Sítá of the beauteous brow.
46340,BOOK V.(787),Or did she perish of alarm
46341,BOOK V.(787),When circled by the monster's arm?
46342,BOOK V.(787),"Or crushed, unable to withstand"
46343,BOOK V.(787),The pressure of that monstrous hand?
46344,BOOK V.(787),"Or when she spurned his suit with scorn,"
46345,BOOK V.(787),Her tender limbs were rent and torn.
46346,BOOK V.(787),"And she, her virtue unsubdued,"
46347,BOOK V.(787),Was slaughtered for the giant's food.
46348,BOOK V.(787),Shall I to Raghu's son relate
46349,BOOK V.(787),"His well-beloved consort's fate,"
46350,BOOK V.(787),My crime the same if I reveal
46351,BOOK V.(787),The mournful story or conceal?
46352,BOOK V.(787),If with no happier tale to tell
46353,BOOK V.(787),"I seek our mountain citadel,"
46354,BOOK V.(787),"How shall I face our lord the king,"
46355,BOOK V.(787),And meet his angry questioning?
46356,BOOK V.(787),"How shall I greet my friends, and brook"
46357,BOOK V.(787),"The muttered taunt, the scornful look?"
46358,BOOK V.(787),How to the son of Raghu go
46359,BOOK V.(787),And kill him with my tale of woe?
46360,BOOK V.(787),For sure the mournful tale I bear

46366,BOOK V.(787),And sad Satrughna with a cry
46367,BOOK V.(787),Of anguish on his corpse will die.
46368,BOOK V.(787),"Our king Sugríva, ever found"
46369,BOOK V.(787),"True to each bond in honour bound,"
46370,BOOK V.(787),"Will mourn the pledge he vainly gave,"
46371,BOOK V.(787),And die with him he could not save.

46378,BOOK V.(787),The ruin of their prince and king
46379,BOOK V.(787),The Vánars' souls with woe will wring.
46380,BOOK V.(787),"And each, overwhelmed with dark despair,"

46382,BOOK V.(787),"Each, graced and honoured long, will miss"
46383,BOOK V.(787),"His careless life of easy bliss,"
46384,BOOK V.(787),In happy troops will play no more
46385,BOOK V.(787),"On breezy rock and shady shore,"
46386,BOOK V.(787),But with his darling wife and child
46387,BOOK V.(787),"Will seek the mountain top, and wild"
46388,BOOK V.(787),"With hopeless desolation, throw"
46389,BOOK V.(787),"Himself, his wife, and babe, below."
46390,BOOK V.(787),Ah no: unless the dame I find
46391,BOOK V.(787),I ne'er will meet my Vánar kind.
46392,BOOK V.(787),Here rather in some distant dell
46393,BOOK V.(787),"A lonely hermit will I dwell,"
46394,BOOK V.(787),Where roots and berries will supply
46395,BOOK V.(787),My humble wants until I die;
46396,BOOK V.(787),Or on the shore will raise a pyre
46397,BOOK V.(787),And perish in the kindled fire.
46398,BOOK V.(787),Or I will strictly fast until

47516,BOOK V.(787),Our banished king Sugríva spied
47517,BOOK V.(787),The princes from the mountain side.
47518,BOOK V.(787),By his command I sought the pair
47519,BOOK V.(787),And led them to our monarch there.
47520,BOOK V.(787),"Thus Ráma and Sugríva met,"
47521,BOOK V.(787),"And joined the bonds that knit them yet,"
47522,BOOK V.(787),"When each besought the other's aid,"
47523,BOOK V.(787),And friendship and alliance made.
47524,BOOK V.(787),An arrow launched from Ráma's bow
47525,BOOK V.(787),"Laid Báli dead, Sugríva's foe."
47526,BOOK V.(787),Then by commandment of our lord
47527,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar hosts each land explored.
47528,BOOK V.(787),We reached the coast: I crossed the sea
47529,BOOK V.(787),"And found my way at length to thee.""(858)"

47535,BOOK V.(787),
47536,BOOK V.(787),
47537,BOOK V.(787),"""Receive,"" he cried, ""this precious ring,(859)"
47538,BOOK V.(787),Sure token from thy lord the king:
47539,BOOK V.(787),The golden ring he wont to wear:
47540,BOOK V.(787),"See, Ráma's name engraven there."""
47541,BOOK V.(787),"Then, as she took the ring he showed,"
47542,BOOK V.(787),The tears that spring of rapture flowed.
47543,BOOK V.(787),She seemed to touch the hand that sent
47544,BOOK V.(787),"The dearly valued ornament,"
47545,BOOK V.(787),"And with her heart again at ease,"
47546,BOOK V.(787),Replied in gentle words like these:
47547,BOOK V.(787),"""O thou, whose soul no fears deter,"
47548,BOOK V.(787),"Wise, brave, and faithful messenger!"
47549,BOOK V.(787),"And hast thou dared, o'er wave and foam,"
47550,BOOK V.(787),To seek me in the giants' home?
47551,BOOK V.(787),"In thee, true messenger, I find"
47552,BOOK V.(787),The noblest of thy woodland kind.
47553,BOOK V.(787),"Who couldst, unmoved by terror, brook"
47554,BOOK V.(787),"On Rávan, king of fiends, to look."
47555,BOOK V.(787),"Now may we commune here as friends,"
47556,BOOK V.(787),For he whom royal Ráma sends
47557,BOOK V.(787),"Must needs be one in danger tried,"
47558,BOOK V.(787),"A valiant, wise, and faithful guide."
47559,BOOK V.(787),"Say, is it well with Ráma still?"
47560,BOOK V.(787),Lives Lakshman yet untouched by ill?
47561,BOOK V.(787),Then why should Ráma's hand be slow
47562,BOOK V.(787),To free his consort from her woe?
47563,BOOK V.(787),"Why spare to burn, in search of me,"
47564,BOOK V.(787),The land encircled by the sea?
47565,BOOK V.(787),Can Bharat send no army out
47566,BOOK V.(787),"With banners, cars and battle shout?"

47569,BOOK V.(787),
47570,BOOK V.(787),His hands upon his head he laid

47573,BOOK V.(787),"His lady of the lotus eyes,"
47574,BOOK V.(787),Or he like Indra from the sky

47576,BOOK V.(787),"Soon will he hear the tale, and then,"
47577,BOOK V.(787),"Roused to revenge, the lord of men"
47578,BOOK V.(787),Will to the giants' island lead
47579,BOOK V.(787),"Fierce myriads of the woodland breed,"
47580,BOOK V.(787),"Bridging his conquering way, and make"
47581,BOOK V.(787),The town a ruin for thy sake.
47582,BOOK V.(787),"Believe my words, sweet dame; I swear"
47583,BOOK V.(787),"By roots and fruit, my woodland fare,"
47584,BOOK V.(787),"By Meru's peak and Vindhva's chain,"
47585,BOOK V.(787),"And Mandar of the Milky Main,"

47588,BOOK V.(787),"Come glorious as the breaking morn,"
47589,BOOK V.(787),Like Indra on Airávat(862) borne.
47590,BOOK V.(787),For thee he looks with longing eyes;
47591,BOOK V.(787),The wood his scanty food supplies.
47592,BOOK V.(787),"For thee his brow is pale and worn,"
47593,BOOK V.(787),For thee are meat and wine forsworn.
47594,BOOK V.(787),"Thine image in his heart he keeps,"
47595,BOOK V.(787),For thee by night he wakes and weeps.
47596,BOOK V.(787),Or if perchance his eyes he close
47597,BOOK V.(787),"And win brief respite from his woes,"
47598,BOOK V.(787),E'en then the name of Sítá slips
47599,BOOK V.(787),In anguish from his murmuring lips.
47600,BOOK V.(787),"If lovely flowers or fruit he sees,"
47601,BOOK V.(787),"Which women love, upon the trees,"

47636,BOOK V.(787),His brother's rede he will not hear.
47637,BOOK V.(787),Vibhishan's daughter(864) loves me well:

47707,BOOK V.(787),And for thy dread lest limb of thine
47708,BOOK V.(787),"Should for a while be touched by mine,"
47709,BOOK V.(787),The modest fear is worthy one

47714,BOOK V.(787),By friendship for thy lord and thee.
47715,BOOK V.(787),But if with me thou wilt not try
47716,BOOK V.(787),"The passage of the windy sky,"

47729,BOOK V.(787),Delighting in the tangled shade.
47730,BOOK V.(787),There on the grass I sat with thee
47731,BOOK V.(787),And laid my head upon thy knee.
47732,BOOK V.(787),There came a greedy crow and pecked
47733,BOOK V.(787),The meat I waited to protect
47734,BOOK V.(787),"And, heedless of the clods I threw,"
47735,BOOK V.(787),"About my head in circles flew,"
47736,BOOK V.(787),Until by darling hunger pressed
47737,BOOK V.(787),He boldly pecked me on the breast.
47738,BOOK V.(787),I ran to thee in rage and grief
47739,BOOK V.(787),And prayed for vengeance on the thief.
47740,BOOK V.(787),Then Ráma(868) from his slumber rose
47741,BOOK V.(787),And smiled with pity at my woes.
47742,BOOK V.(787),Upon my bleeding breast he saw
47743,BOOK V.(787),The scratches made by beak and claw.
47744,BOOK V.(787),"He laid an arrow on his bow,"
47745,BOOK V.(787),And launched it at the shameless crow.

47750,BOOK V.(787),Couldst thou for me with anger stirred

47857,BOOK V.(787),"Has filled my spirit with affright."""
47858,BOOK V.(787),Some pressed round Sítá in a ring;
47859,BOOK V.(787),Some bore the story to their king:
47860,BOOK V.(787),"""A mighty creature of our race,"
47861,BOOK V.(787),"In monkey form, has reached the place."
47862,BOOK V.(787),"He came within the grove,"" they cried,"
47863,BOOK V.(787),"""He stood and talked by Sítá's side,"
47864,BOOK V.(787),"He comes from Indra's court to her,"
47865,BOOK V.(787),Or is Kuvera's messenger;
47866,BOOK V.(787),Or Ráma sent the spy to seek
47867,BOOK V.(787),"His consort, and her wrongs to wreak."
47868,BOOK V.(787),"His crushing arm, his trampling feet"
47869,BOOK V.(787),"Have marred and spoiled that dear retreat,"
47870,BOOK V.(787),And all the pleasant place which thou
47871,BOOK V.(787),So lovest is a ruin now.
47872,BOOK V.(787),The tree where Sítá sat alone
47873,BOOK V.(787),Is spared where all are overthrown.
47874,BOOK V.(787),Perchance he saved the dame from harm:
47875,BOOK V.(787),"Perchance the toil had numbed his arm."""
47876,BOOK V.(787),
47877,BOOK V.(787),Then flashed the giant's eye with fire
47878,BOOK V.(787),Like that which lights the funeral pyre.
47879,BOOK V.(787),He bade his bravest Kinkars(871) speed
47880,BOOK V.(787),And to his feet the spoiler lead.
47881,BOOK V.(787),"Forth from the palace, at his hest,"
47882,BOOK V.(787),Twice forty thousand warriors pressed.
47883,BOOK V.(787),"Burning for battle, strong and fierce,"
47884,BOOK V.(787),"With clubs to crush and swords to pierce,"
47885,BOOK V.(787),"They saw Hanúmán near a porch,"
47886,BOOK V.(787),"And, thick as moths around a torch,"
47887,BOOK V.(787),Rushed on the foe with wild attacks
47888,BOOK V.(787),Of mace and club and battle-axe.
47889,BOOK V.(787),"As round him pressed the Rákshas crowd,"
47890,BOOK V.(787),"The wondrous monkey roared aloud,"
47891,BOOK V.(787),That birds fell headlong from the sky:
47892,BOOK V.(787),Then spake he with a mighty cry:
47893,BOOK V.(787),"""Long life to Dasaratha's heir,"
47894,BOOK V.(787),"And Lakshman, ever-glorious pair!"
47895,BOOK V.(787),"Long life to him who rules our race,"
47896,BOOK V.(787),Preserved by noblest Ráma's grace!
47897,BOOK V.(787),"I am the slave of Kosal's king,(872)"
47898,BOOK V.(787),Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing.
47899,BOOK V.(787),"Hanúmán I, the Wind-God's seed:"
47900,BOOK V.(787),Beneath this arm the foemen bleed.
47901,BOOK V.(787),"I fear not, unapproached in might,"
47902,BOOK V.(787),"A thousand Rávan's ranged for fight,"
47903,BOOK V.(787),Although in furious hands they rear
47904,BOOK V.(787),"The hill and tree for sword and spear,"
47905,BOOK V.(787),"I will, before the giants' eyes,"
47906,BOOK V.(787),Their city and their king chastise;
47907,BOOK V.(787),"And, having communed with the dame,"
47908,BOOK V.(787),"Depart in triumph as I came."""
47909,BOOK V.(787),
47910,BOOK V.(787),At that terrific roar and yell
47911,BOOK V.(787),The heart of every giant fell.
47912,BOOK V.(787),But still their king's command they feared
47913,BOOK V.(787),And pressed around with arms upreared.
47914,BOOK V.(787),Beside the porch a club was laid:
47915,BOOK V.(787),"The Vánar caught it up, and swayed"
47916,BOOK V.(787),"The weapon round his head, and slew"
47917,BOOK V.(787),The foremost of the Rákshas crew.
47918,BOOK V.(787),"Thus Indra vanquished, thousand-eyed,"
47919,BOOK V.(787),The Daityas who the Gods defied.
47920,BOOK V.(787),"Then on the porch Hanúmán sprang,"
47921,BOOK V.(787),And loud his shout of triumph rang.
47922,BOOK V.(787),"The giants looked upon the dead,"
47923,BOOK V.(787),And turning to their monarch fled.
47924,BOOK V.(787),And Rávan with his spirit wrought
47925,BOOK V.(787),"To frenzy by the tale they brought,"
47926,BOOK V.(787),"Urged to the fight Prahasta's son,"
47927,BOOK V.(787),Of all his chiefs the mightiest one.

47937,BOOK V.(787),"High as the hill of Meru, stood"
47938,BOOK V.(787),Amid the ruins of the wood;
47939,BOOK V.(787),And in his fury thundered out
47940,BOOK V.(787),Again his haughty battle-shout:
47941,BOOK V.(787),"""I am the slave of Kosal's King"
47942,BOOK V.(787),"Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing."""
47943,BOOK V.(787),"Forth hurried, by that shout alarmed,"
47944,BOOK V.(787),The warders of the temple armed
47945,BOOK V.(787),"With every weapon haste supplied,"
47946,BOOK V.(787),"And closed him in on every side,"
47947,BOOK V.(787),With bands that strove to pierce and strike
47948,BOOK V.(787),With shaft and axe and club and pike.
47949,BOOK V.(787),Then from its base the Vánar tore
47950,BOOK V.(787),A pillar with the weight it bore.
47951,BOOK V.(787),"Against the wall the mass he dashed,"
47952,BOOK V.(787),"And forth the flames in answer flashed,"
47953,BOOK V.(787),That wildly ran o'er roofs and wall
47954,BOOK V.(787),In hungry rage consuming all.
47955,BOOK V.(787),He whirled the pillar round his head
47956,BOOK V.(787),And struck a hundred giants dead.
47957,BOOK V.(787),Then high upheld on air he rose
47958,BOOK V.(787),And called in thunder to his foes:
47959,BOOK V.(787),"""A thousand Vánar chiefs like me"

47961,BOOK V.(787),Terrific might we all possess:

47965,BOOK V.(787),"Backed by his bravest myriads, he"
47966,BOOK V.(787),Our warrior lord will cross the sea.
47967,BOOK V.(787),"Then Lanká's lofty towers, and all"

47984,BOOK V.(787),"A bow like Indra's own(874), and store"
47985,BOOK V.(787),Of glittering shafts the chieftain bore.
47986,BOOK V.(787),And ever as the string he tried
47987,BOOK V.(787),"The weapon with a roar replied,"
47988,BOOK V.(787),Loud as the crashing thunder sent
47989,BOOK V.(787),By him who rules the firmament.
47990,BOOK V.(787),Soon as the foeman came in view
47991,BOOK V.(787),"Borne on a car which asses drew,"
47992,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar chieftain mighty-voiced
47993,BOOK V.(787),Shouted in triumph and rejoiced.
47994,BOOK V.(787),"Prahasta's son his bow-string drew,"
47995,BOOK V.(787),"And swift the winged arrows flew,"
47996,BOOK V.(787),"One in the face the Vánar smote,"
47997,BOOK V.(787),Another quivered in his throat.
47998,BOOK V.(787),Ten from the deadly weapon sent
47999,BOOK V.(787),His brawny arms and shoulders rent.
48000,BOOK V.(787),Then as he felt each galling shot
48001,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar's rage waxed fiercely hot.
48002,BOOK V.(787),"He looked, and saw a mass of stone"
48003,BOOK V.(787),That lay before his feet o'erthrown.
48004,BOOK V.(787),"The mighty block he raised and threw,"
48005,BOOK V.(787),And crashing through the air it flew.
48006,BOOK V.(787),"But Jambumáli shunned the blow,"
48007,BOOK V.(787),And rained fresh arrows from his bow.
48008,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar's limbs were red with gore:
48009,BOOK V.(787),"A Sál tree from the earth he tore,"
48010,BOOK V.(787),"And, ere he hurled it undismayed,"
48011,BOOK V.(787),Above his head the missile swayed.
48012,BOOK V.(787),But shafts from Jambumáli's bow
48013,BOOK V.(787),Cut through it ere his hand could throw.
48014,BOOK V.(787),And thigh and arm and chest and side
48015,BOOK V.(787),With streams of rushing blood were dyed.
48016,BOOK V.(787),Still unsubdued though wounded oft
48017,BOOK V.(787),"The shattered trunk he raised aloft,"
48018,BOOK V.(787),And down with well-directed aim
48019,BOOK V.(787),On Jambumáli's chest it came.
48020,BOOK V.(787),There crushed upon the trampled grass
48021,BOOK V.(787),"He lay an undistinguished mass,"
48022,BOOK V.(787),The foeman's eye no more could see
48023,BOOK V.(787),His head or chest or arm or knee.
48024,BOOK V.(787),And bow and car and steeds(875) and store
48025,BOOK V.(787),Of glittering shafts were seen no more.
48026,BOOK V.(787),
48027,BOOK V.(787),"When Jambumáli's death he heard,"

48050,BOOK V.(787),And from the ponderous bows they strained
48051,BOOK V.(787),A shower of deadly arrows rained.
48052,BOOK V.(787),Then scarce was seen the Vánar's form
48053,BOOK V.(787),Enveloped in the arrowy storm.
48054,BOOK V.(787),So stands half veiled the Mountains' King

48064,BOOK V.(787),He raised a mighty roar and yell
48065,BOOK V.(787),"That fear on all the army fell,"
48066,BOOK V.(787),"And then, his warrior soul aglow"
48067,BOOK V.(787),"With fury, rushed upon the foe,"
48068,BOOK V.(787),Some with his open hand he beat
48069,BOOK V.(787),To death and trampled with his feet;

48076,BOOK V.(787),"The remnant, seized with sudden dread,"
48077,BOOK V.(787),Turned from the grove and wildly fled.
48078,BOOK V.(787),The trampled earth was thickly strown
48079,BOOK V.(787),"With steed and car and flag o'erthrown,"

48115,BOOK V.(787),And bright their weapons flashed and glowed.
48116,BOOK V.(787),They saw: they charged in wild career
48117,BOOK V.(787),With sword and mace and axe and spear.
48118,BOOK V.(787),From Durdhar's bow five arrows sped
48119,BOOK V.(787),And quivered in the Vánar's head.
48120,BOOK V.(787),He rose and roared: the fearful sound
48121,BOOK V.(787),Made all the region echo round.
48122,BOOK V.(787),Then from above his weight he threw
48123,BOOK V.(787),On Durdhar's car that near him drew.
48124,BOOK V.(787),The weight that came with lightning speed
48125,BOOK V.(787),"Crushed pole and axle, car and steed."
48126,BOOK V.(787),"It shattered Durdhar's head and neck,"
48127,BOOK V.(787),And left him lifeless mid the wreck.
48128,BOOK V.(787),"Yúpáksha saw the warrior die,"
48129,BOOK V.(787),"And Virúpáksha heard his cry,"
48130,BOOK V.(787),"And, mad for vengeance for the slain,"
48131,BOOK V.(787),They charged their Vánar foe again.
48132,BOOK V.(787),He rose in air: they onward pressed
48133,BOOK V.(787),And fiercely smote him on the breast.
48134,BOOK V.(787),In vain they struck his iron frame:
48135,BOOK V.(787),"With eagle swoop to earth he came,"
48136,BOOK V.(787),Tore from the ground a tree that grew
48137,BOOK V.(787),"Beside him, and the demons slew."
48138,BOOK V.(787),"Then Bhásakama raised his spear,"
48139,BOOK V.(787),"And Praghas with a laugh drew near,"
48140,BOOK V.(787),"And, maddened at the sight, the two"
48141,BOOK V.(787),Against the undaunted Vánar flew.
48142,BOOK V.(787),"As from his wounds the torrents flowed,"
48143,BOOK V.(787),Like a red sun the Vánar showed.
48144,BOOK V.(787),"He turned, a mountain peak to seize"
48145,BOOK V.(787),With all its beasts and snakes and trees.
48146,BOOK V.(787),He hurled it on the pair: and they

48158,BOOK V.(787),And shouted for his bow and lance.
48159,BOOK V.(787),He rode upon a glorious car
48160,BOOK V.(787),That shot the light of gems afar.
48161,BOOK V.(787),His pennon waved mid glittering gold
48162,BOOK V.(787),"And bright the wheels with jewels rolled,"
48163,BOOK V.(787),By long and fierce devotion won
48164,BOOK V.(787),That car was splendid as the sun.
48165,BOOK V.(787),With rows of various weapons stored;
48166,BOOK V.(787),And thought-swift horses whirled their lord

48169,BOOK V.(787),Then fierce and fearful war between

48171,BOOK V.(787),"The Gods and Asurs stood amazed,"
48172,BOOK V.(787),And on the wondrous combat gazed.
48173,BOOK V.(787),"A cry from earth rose long and shrill,"

48175,BOOK V.(787),"The thunder bellowed from the sky,"
48176,BOOK V.(787),And troubled ocean roared reply.
48177,BOOK V.(787),"Thrice Aksha strained his dreadful bow,"
48178,BOOK V.(787),"Thrice smote his arrow on the foe,"
48179,BOOK V.(787),And with full streams of crimson bled
48180,BOOK V.(787),Three gashes in the Vánar's head.
48181,BOOK V.(787),Then rose Hanúmán in the air
48182,BOOK V.(787),To shun the shafts no life could bear.
48183,BOOK V.(787),"But Aksha in his car pursued,"
48184,BOOK V.(787),And from on high the fight renewed
48185,BOOK V.(787),"With storm of arrows, thick as hail"
48186,BOOK V.(787),When angry clouds some hill assail.
48187,BOOK V.(787),Impatient of that arrowy shower
48188,BOOK V.(787),"The Vánar chief put forth his power,"
48189,BOOK V.(787),Again above his chariot rose
48190,BOOK V.(787),And smote him with repeated blows.
48191,BOOK V.(787),Terrific came each deadly stroke:
48192,BOOK V.(787),Breast neck and arm and back he broke;
48193,BOOK V.(787),"And Aksha fell to earth, and lay"

48201,BOOK V.(787),
48202,BOOK V.(787),To Indrajít(878) the bold and brave
48203,BOOK V.(787),The giant king his mandate gave:
48204,BOOK V.(787),"""O trained in warlike science, best"
48205,BOOK V.(787),"In arms of all our mightiest,"
48206,BOOK V.(787),Whose valour in the conflict shown
48207,BOOK V.(787),"To Asurs and to Gods is known,"
48208,BOOK V.(787),"The Kinkars whom I sent are slain,"
48209,BOOK V.(787),And Jambumálí and his train;
48210,BOOK V.(787),The lords who led our giant bands
48211,BOOK V.(787),Have fallen by the monkey's hands;
48212,BOOK V.(787),"With shattered cars the ground is spread,"
48213,BOOK V.(787),And Aksha lies amid the dead.
48214,BOOK V.(787),"Thou art my best and bravest: go,"
48215,BOOK V.(787),"Unmatched in power, and slay the foe."""
48216,BOOK V.(787),He heard the hest: he bent his head;
48217,BOOK V.(787),Athirst for battle forth he sped.
48218,BOOK V.(787),"Four tigers fierce, of tawny hue,"
48219,BOOK V.(787),"With fearful teeth, his chariot drew."
48220,BOOK V.(787),
48221,BOOK V.(787),"Hanúmán heard his strong bow clang,"
48222,BOOK V.(787),"And swiftly from the earth he sprang,"
48223,BOOK V.(787),While weak and ineffective fell
48224,BOOK V.(787),The archer's shafts though pointed well.
48225,BOOK V.(787),The Rákshas saw that naught might kill
48226,BOOK V.(787),"The wondrous foe who mocked his skill,"
48227,BOOK V.(787),And launched a magic shaft to throw
48228,BOOK V.(787),A binding spell about his foe.
48229,BOOK V.(787),Forth flew the shaft: the mystic charm
48230,BOOK V.(787),"Stayed his swift feet and numbed his arm,"
48231,BOOK V.(787),"Through all his frame he felt the spell,"
48232,BOOK V.(787),And motionless to earth he fell.
48233,BOOK V.(787),Nor would the reverent Vánar loose
48234,BOOK V.(787),The bonds that bound him as a noose.
48235,BOOK V.(787),He knew that Brahmá's self had charmed
48236,BOOK V.(787),The weapon that his might disarmed.
48237,BOOK V.(787),
48238,BOOK V.(787),"They saw him helpless on the ground,"
48239,BOOK V.(787),"And all the giants pressed around,"
48240,BOOK V.(787),And bonds of hemp and bark were cast
48241,BOOK V.(787),About his limbs to hold him fast.
48242,BOOK V.(787),They drew the ropes round feet and wrists;
48243,BOOK V.(787),"They beat him with their hands and fists,"
48244,BOOK V.(787),And dragged him as they strained the cord
48245,BOOK V.(787),With shouts of triumph to their lord.(879)

48251,BOOK V.(787),
48252,BOOK V.(787),
48253,BOOK V.(787),On the fierce king Hanúmán turned
48254,BOOK V.(787),His angry eyes that glowed and burned.
48255,BOOK V.(787),He saw him decked with wealth untold
48256,BOOK V.(787),"Of diamond and pearl and gold,"
48257,BOOK V.(787),And priceless was each wondrous gem
48258,BOOK V.(787),That sparkled in his diadem.
48259,BOOK V.(787),"About his neck rich chains were twined,"
48260,BOOK V.(787),"The best that fancy e'er designed,"
48261,BOOK V.(787),And a fair robe with pearls bestrung
48262,BOOK V.(787),Down from his mighty shoulders hung.
48263,BOOK V.(787),"Ten heads he reared,(880) as Mandar's hill"
48264,BOOK V.(787),"Lifts woody peaks which tigers fill,"
48265,BOOK V.(787),"Bright were his eyes, and bright, beneath,"
48266,BOOK V.(787),The flashes of his awful teeth.
48267,BOOK V.(787),His brawny arms of wondrous size
48268,BOOK V.(787),Were decked with rings and scented dyes.
48269,BOOK V.(787),His hands like snakes with five long heads
48270,BOOK V.(787),Descending from their mountain beds.
48271,BOOK V.(787),He sat upon a crystal throne
48272,BOOK V.(787),"Inlaid with wealth of precious stone,"
48273,BOOK V.(787),"Whereon, of noblest work, was set"
48274,BOOK V.(787),A gold-embroidered coverlet.
48275,BOOK V.(787),Behind the monarch stood the best
48276,BOOK V.(787),"Of beauteous women gaily dressed,"
48277,BOOK V.(787),"And each her giant master fanned,"
48278,BOOK V.(787),Or waved a chourie in her hand.
48279,BOOK V.(787),Four noble courtiers(881) wise and good
48280,BOOK V.(787),"In counsel, near the monarch stood,"
48281,BOOK V.(787),As the four oceans ever stand
48282,BOOK V.(787),About the sea-encompassed land.
48283,BOOK V.(787),"Still, though his heart with rage was fired,"
48284,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar marvelled and admired:
48285,BOOK V.(787),"""O what a rare and wondrous sight!"
48286,BOOK V.(787),"What beauty, majesty, and might!"
48287,BOOK V.(787),All regal pomp combines to grace
48288,BOOK V.(787),This ruler of the Rákshas race.
48289,BOOK V.(787),"He, if he scorned not right and law,"
48290,BOOK V.(787),Might guide the world with tempered awe:
48291,BOOK V.(787),"Yea, Indra and the Gods on high"
48292,BOOK V.(787),"Might on his saving power rely."""

48298,BOOK V.(787),
48299,BOOK V.(787),
48300,BOOK V.(787),Then fierce the giant's fury blazed
48301,BOOK V.(787),"As on Hanúmán's form he gazed,"
48302,BOOK V.(787),And shaken by each wild surmise
48303,BOOK V.(787),He spake aloud with flashing eyes:
48304,BOOK V.(787),"""Can this be Nandi(882) standing here,"
48305,BOOK V.(787),The mighty one whom all revere?
48306,BOOK V.(787),Who once on high Kailása's hill
48307,BOOK V.(787),Pronounced the curse that haunts me still?
48308,BOOK V.(787),Or is the woodland creature one
48309,BOOK V.(787),"Of Asur race, or Bali's(883) son?"
48310,BOOK V.(787),The wretch with searching question try:
48311,BOOK V.(787),"Learn who he is, and whence; and why"
48312,BOOK V.(787),"He marred the glory of the grove,"
48313,BOOK V.(787),"And with my captains fiercely strove."""
48314,BOOK V.(787),"Prahasta heard his lord's behest,"
48315,BOOK V.(787),And thus the Vánar chief addressed:
48316,BOOK V.(787),"""O monkey stranger be consoled:"
48317,BOOK V.(787),"Fear not, and let thy heart be bold."
48318,BOOK V.(787),If thou by Indra's mandate sent
48319,BOOK V.(787),"Thy steps to Lanká's isle hast bent,"
48320,BOOK V.(787),"With fearless words the cause explain,"
48321,BOOK V.(787),And freedom thou shalt soon regain.
48322,BOOK V.(787),Or if thou comest as a spy
48323,BOOK V.(787),"Despatched by Vishnu in the sky,"
48324,BOOK V.(787),"Or sent by Yáma, or the Lord"
48325,BOOK V.(787),"Of Riches, hast our town explored;"
48326,BOOK V.(787),Proved by the prowess thou hast shown
48327,BOOK V.(787),No monkey save in form alone;
48328,BOOK V.(787),"Speak boldly all the truth, and be"
48329,BOOK V.(787),"Released from bonds, unharmed and free."
48330,BOOK V.(787),But falsehood spoken to our king
48331,BOOK V.(787),"Swift punishment of death will bring."""
48332,BOOK V.(787),
48333,BOOK V.(787),He ceased: the Vánar made reply;
48334,BOOK V.(787),"""Not Indra's messenger am I,"
48335,BOOK V.(787),Nor came I hither to fulfil
48336,BOOK V.(787),Kuvera's hest or Vishnu's will.
48337,BOOK V.(787),I stand before the giants here
48338,BOOK V.(787),A Vánar e'en as I appear.
48339,BOOK V.(787),I longed to see the king: 'twas hard
48340,BOOK V.(787),To win my way through gate and guard.
48341,BOOK V.(787),And so to gain my wish I laid
48342,BOOK V.(787),In ruin that delightful shade.
48343,BOOK V.(787),"No fiend, no God of heavenly kind"
48344,BOOK V.(787),With bond or chain these limbs may bind.
48345,BOOK V.(787),The Eternal Sire himself of old
48346,BOOK V.(787),"Vouchsafed the boon that makes me bold,"
48347,BOOK V.(787),From Brahmá's magic shaft released(884)

48363,BOOK V.(787),"Hanumán, to this isle I came."
48364,BOOK V.(787),To set the Maithil lady free
48365,BOOK V.(787),I crossed the barrier of the sea.
48366,BOOK V.(787),I roamed in search of her and found
48367,BOOK V.(787),Her weeping in that lovely ground.

48369,BOOK V.(787),Who hast by stern devotion gained

48376,BOOK V.(787),"O Giant King, repent the crime"

48378,BOOK V.(787),Now be the Maithil queen restored
48379,BOOK V.(787),Uninjured to her sorrowing lord.
48380,BOOK V.(787),Soon wilt thou rue thy dire mistake:

48417,BOOK V.(787),"Vibhishan heard the stern behest,"

48419,BOOK V.(787),"Then, trained in arts that soothe and please"
48420,BOOK V.(787),Addressed the king in words like these:
48421,BOOK V.(787),
48422,BOOK V.(787),"""Revoke, my lord, thy fierce decree,"
48423,BOOK V.(787),And hear the words I speak to thee.
48424,BOOK V.(787),Kings wise and noble ne'er condemn
48425,BOOK V.(787),To death the envoys sent to them.
48426,BOOK V.(787),Such deed the world's contempt would draw
48427,BOOK V.(787),On him who breaks the ancient law.(885)
48428,BOOK V.(787),"Observe the mean where justice lies,"
48429,BOOK V.(787),"And spare his life but still chastise."""
48430,BOOK V.(787),"Then forth the tyrant's fury broke,"
48431,BOOK V.(787),And thus in angry words he spoke:
48432,BOOK V.(787),"""O hero, when the wicked bleed"
48433,BOOK V.(787),No sin or shame attends the deed.
48434,BOOK V.(787),"The Vánar's blood must needs be spilt,"

48440,BOOK V.(787),"""Thy foeman's envoy thou shalt spare."""
48441,BOOK V.(787),'Tis true he comes an open foe:

48466,BOOK V.(787),"""Thy words are wise and true: to kill"
48467,BOOK V.(787),An envoy would beseem us ill.
48468,BOOK V.(787),Yet must we for his crime invent

48476,BOOK V.(787),
48477,BOOK V.(787),The giants heard their monarch's speech;
48478,BOOK V.(787),"And, filled with burning fury, each"
48479,BOOK V.(787),"Brought strips of cotton cloth, and round"
48480,BOOK V.(787),The monkey's tail the bandage wound.
48481,BOOK V.(787),As round his tail the bands they drew
48482,BOOK V.(787),His mighty form dilating grew
48483,BOOK V.(787),Vast as the flame that bursts on high

48487,BOOK V.(787),"Delighted as they viewed the blaze,"
48488,BOOK V.(787),The cruel demons stood at gaze:
48489,BOOK V.(787),And mid loud drums and shells rang out
48490,BOOK V.(787),The triumph of their joyful shout.
48491,BOOK V.(787),They pressed about him thick and fast
48492,BOOK V.(787),"As through the crowded streets he passed,"
48493,BOOK V.(787),Observing with attentive care
48494,BOOK V.(787),"Each rich and wondrous structure there,"
48495,BOOK V.(787),Still heedless of the eager cry

48497,BOOK V.(787),
48498,BOOK V.(787),"Some to the captive lady ran,"

48504,BOOK V.(787),The mournful news the lady heard
48505,BOOK V.(787),That with fresh grief her bosom stirred.
48506,BOOK V.(787),Swift to the kindled fire she went
48507,BOOK V.(787),And prayed before it reverent:
48508,BOOK V.(787),"""If I my husband have obeyed,"
48509,BOOK V.(787),"And kept the ascetic vows I made,"

48512,BOOK V.(787),
48513,BOOK V.(787),Then leapt on high the flickering flame
48514,BOOK V.(787),And shone in answer to the dame.
48515,BOOK V.(787),The pitying fire its rage forbore:
48516,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar felt the heat no more.
48517,BOOK V.(787),"Then, to minutest size reduced,"

48523,BOOK V.(787),"Rushed at the fiends that hemmed him round,"
48524,BOOK V.(787),And laid them lifeless on the ground.
48525,BOOK V.(787),"Through Lanká's town again he strode,"
48526,BOOK V.(787),"And viewed each street and square and road,--"

48549,BOOK V.(787),"From house to house he hurried on,"
48550,BOOK V.(787),And the wild flames behind him shone.
48551,BOOK V.(787),"Each mansion of the foe he scaled,"
48552,BOOK V.(787),And furious fire its roof assailed
48553,BOOK V.(787),Till all the common ruin shared:
48554,BOOK V.(787),Vibhishan's house alone was spared.
48555,BOOK V.(787),"From blazing pile to pile he sprang,"
48556,BOOK V.(787),"And loud his shout of triumph rang,"
48557,BOOK V.(787),As roars the doomsday cloud when all
48558,BOOK V.(787),The worlds in dissolution fall.
48559,BOOK V.(787),The friendly wind conspired to fan
48560,BOOK V.(787),"The hungry flames that leapt and ran,"
48561,BOOK V.(787),And spreading in their fury caught
48562,BOOK V.(787),"The gilded walls with pearls inwrought,"
48563,BOOK V.(787),Till each proud palace reeled and fell
48564,BOOK V.(787),As falls a heavenly citadel.
48565,BOOK V.(787),
48566,BOOK V.(787),Loud was the roar the demons raised
48567,BOOK V.(787),"Mid walls that split and beams that blazed,"
48568,BOOK V.(787),As each with vain endeavour strove
48569,BOOK V.(787),To stay the flames in house or grove.
48570,BOOK V.(787),"The women, with dishevelled hair,"
48571,BOOK V.(787),"Flocked to the roofs in wild despair,"
48572,BOOK V.(787),"Shrieked out for succour, wept aloud,"
48573,BOOK V.(787),"And fell, like lightning from a cloud."
48574,BOOK V.(787),He saw the flames ascend and curl
48575,BOOK V.(787),"Round turkis, diamond, and pearl,"
48576,BOOK V.(787),While silver floods and molten gold
48577,BOOK V.(787),From ruined wall and latice rolled.
48578,BOOK V.(787),As fire grows fiercer as he feeds
48579,BOOK V.(787),"On wood and grass and crackling reeds,"

48591,BOOK V.(787),"And, as his bosom felt their weight"
48592,BOOK V.(787),He stood a while to meditate.
48593,BOOK V.(787),"""What have I done?"", he thought with shame,"
48594,BOOK V.(787),"""Destroyed the town with hostile flame."
48595,BOOK V.(787),O happy they whose firm control
48596,BOOK V.(787),Checks the wild passion of the soul;
48597,BOOK V.(787),Who on the fires of anger throw
48598,BOOK V.(787),The cooling drops that check their glow.
48599,BOOK V.(787),"But woe is me, whom wrath could lead"

48616,BOOK V.(787),Its guardian influence round her head?
48617,BOOK V.(787),"She lives untouched,--the peerless dame;"
48618,BOOK V.(787),Flame has no fury for the flame.(887)

48649,BOOK V.(787),He scaled Arishta's glorious steep
48650,BOOK V.(787),Whose summits beetled o'er the deep.
48651,BOOK V.(787),The woods in varied beauty dressed
48652,BOOK V.(787),"Hung like a garland round his crest,"
48653,BOOK V.(787),And clouds of ever changing hue
48654,BOOK V.(787),A robe about his shoulders threw.
48655,BOOK V.(787),On him the rays of morning fell
48656,BOOK V.(787),"To wake the hill they loved so well,"
48657,BOOK V.(787),And bid unclose those splendid eyes
48658,BOOK V.(787),That glittered in his mineral dyes.
48659,BOOK V.(787),He woke to hear the music made
48660,BOOK V.(787),"By thunders of the white cascade,"
48661,BOOK V.(787),While every laughing rill that sprang
48662,BOOK V.(787),From crag to crag its carol sang.
48663,BOOK V.(787),"For arms, he lifted to the stars"
48664,BOOK V.(787),"His towering stems of Deodárs,"
48665,BOOK V.(787),And morning heard his pealing call
48666,BOOK V.(787),In tumbling brook and waterfall.
48667,BOOK V.(787),He trembled when his woods were pale
48668,BOOK V.(787),"And bowed beneath the autumn gale,"

48671,BOOK V.(787),
48672,BOOK V.(787),Far down against the mountain's feet
48673,BOOK V.(787),The Vánar heard the wild waves beat;
48674,BOOK V.(787),Then turned his glances to the north.
48675,BOOK V.(787),"Sprang from the peak and bounded forth,"
48676,BOOK V.(787),The mountain felt the fearful shock
48677,BOOK V.(787),And trembled through his mass of rock.
48678,BOOK V.(787),The tallest trees were crushed and rent
48679,BOOK V.(787),"And headlong to the valley sent,"
48680,BOOK V.(787),And as the rocking shook each cave
48681,BOOK V.(787),Loud was the roar the lions gave.
48682,BOOK V.(787),Forth from the shaken cavern came
48683,BOOK V.(787),Fierce serpents with their tongues aflame;

48720,BOOK V.(787),"Loud as the wind, when tempests rave,"
48721,BOOK V.(787),Roars in the prison of the cave.
48722,BOOK V.(787),"From crag to crag, from height to height;"
48723,BOOK V.(787),"They bounded in their mad delight,"
48724,BOOK V.(787),"And when he touched the mountain's crest,"
48725,BOOK V.(787),With reverent welcome round him pressed.

48727,BOOK V.(787),"They brought him of the choicest roots,"

48736,BOOK V.(787),"They sat beneath the waving trees,"

48754,BOOK V.(787),Dark with their shadow as they flew.
48755,BOOK V.(787),Swift to a lovely grove(891) they came
48756,BOOK V.(787),That rivalled heavenly Nandan's(892) fame;
48757,BOOK V.(787),"Where countless bees their honey stored,--"
48758,BOOK V.(787),"The pleasance of the Vánars' lord,"

48763,BOOK V.(787),To Angad came with one accord
48764,BOOK V.(787),"The Vánars, and besought their lord"
48765,BOOK V.(787),That they those honeyed stores might eat
48766,BOOK V.(787),That made the grove so passing sweet.
48767,BOOK V.(787),
48768,BOOK V.(787),He gave consent: they sought the trees
48769,BOOK V.(787),Thronged with innumerable bees.
48770,BOOK V.(787),"They rifled all the treasured store,"
48771,BOOK V.(787),"And ate the fruit the branches bore,"
48772,BOOK V.(787),And still as they prolonged the feast
48773,BOOK V.(787),Their merriment and joy increased.
48774,BOOK V.(787),"Drunk with the sweets, they danced and bowed,"

48778,BOOK V.(787),"Some scaled the trees which creepers crowned,"
48779,BOOK V.(787),And rained the branches to the ground.
48780,BOOK V.(787),There with loud laugh a Vánar sprang
48781,BOOK V.(787),"Close to his friend who madly sang,"
48782,BOOK V.(787),In doleful mood another crept
48783,BOOK V.(787),To mix his tears with one who wept.
48784,BOOK V.(787),
48785,BOOK V.(787),Then Dadhimukh with fury viewed
48786,BOOK V.(787),The intoxicated multitude.
48787,BOOK V.(787),"He looked upon the rifled shade,"
48788,BOOK V.(787),And all the ruin they had made;
48789,BOOK V.(787),"Then called with angry voice, and strove"
48790,BOOK V.(787),To save the remnant of the grove.
48791,BOOK V.(787),"But warning cries and words were spurned,"
48792,BOOK V.(787),And angry taunt and threat returned.
48793,BOOK V.(787),Then fierce and wild contention rose:
48794,BOOK V.(787),With furious words he mingled blows.
48795,BOOK V.(787),"They by no shame or fear withheld,"
48796,BOOK V.(787),"By drunken mood and ire impelled,"
48797,BOOK V.(787),"Used claws, and teeth, and hands, and beat"

48826,BOOK V.(787),I found her vext with taunt and threat

48828,BOOK V.(787),"Her tresses twined in single braid,"
48829,BOOK V.(787),On the bare earth her limbs were laid.
48830,BOOK V.(787),Sad were her eyes: her cheeks were pale
48831,BOOK V.(787),As shuddering flowers in winter's gale.
48832,BOOK V.(787),"I stood beside the weeping dame,"
48833,BOOK V.(787),And gently whispered Ráma's name:

48840,BOOK V.(787),And bright mark pressed upon her brow
48841,BOOK V.(787),When none was nigh but she and thou.
48842,BOOK V.(787),"She bids thee take this precious stone,"
48843,BOOK V.(787),The sea-born gem thou long hast known.
48844,BOOK V.(787),"""And I,"" she said, ""will dull the sting"

49578,BOOK VI.(895),Nor let us perish for thy crime.
49579,BOOK VI.(895),"O, let the Maithil lady go"
49580,BOOK VI.(895),Ere the avenger bend his bow
49581,BOOK VI.(895),To ruin with his arrowy showers
49582,BOOK VI.(895),Our Lanká with her gates and towers.
49583,BOOK VI.(895),Let Janak's child again be free
49584,BOOK VI.(895),"Ere the wild Vánars cross the sea,"

49587,BOOK VI.(895),"Ah, I conjure thee by the ties"
49588,BOOK VI.(895),"Of brotherhood, be just and wise."
49589,BOOK VI.(895),"In all my thoughts thy good I seek,"

49591,BOOK VI.(895),Let captive Sítá be restored
49592,BOOK VI.(895),"Ere, fierce as autumn's sun, her lord"
49593,BOOK VI.(895),Send his keen arrows from the string
49594,BOOK VI.(895),To drink the life-blood of our king.
49595,BOOK VI.(895),"This fury from thy soul dismiss,"
49596,BOOK VI.(895),"The bane of duty, peace, and bliss."
49597,BOOK VI.(895),"Seek duty's path and walk therein,"
49598,BOOK VI.(895),And joy and endless glory win.
49599,BOOK VI.(895),"Restore the captive, ere we feel"

49601,BOOK VI.(895),"O spare thy city, spare the lives"

49603,BOOK VI.(895),
49604,BOOK VI.(895),Thus spake Vibhishan wise and brave:
49605,BOOK VI.(895),"The Rákshas king no answer gave,"
49606,BOOK VI.(895),"But bade his lords the council close,"
49607,BOOK VI.(895),And sought his chamber for repose.

49616,BOOK VI.(895),"Vibhishan from his slumber woke,"
49617,BOOK VI.(895),"And, duty guiding every thought,"
49618,BOOK VI.(895),The palace of his brother sought.
49619,BOOK VI.(895),Vast as a towering hill that shows
49620,BOOK VI.(895),"His peaks afar, that palace rose."
49621,BOOK VI.(895),Here stood within the monarch's gate
49622,BOOK VI.(895),Sage nobles skilful in debate.
49623,BOOK VI.(895),There strayed in glittering raiment through
49624,BOOK VI.(895),"The courts his royal retinue,"
49625,BOOK VI.(895),Where in wild measure rose and fell
49626,BOOK VI.(895),"The music of the drum and shell,"
49627,BOOK VI.(895),"And talk grew loud, and many a dame"
49628,BOOK VI.(895),Of fairest feature went and came
49629,BOOK VI.(895),"Through doors a marvel to behold,"
49630,BOOK VI.(895),With pearl inlaid on burning gold:
49631,BOOK VI.(895),Therein Gandharvas or the fleet
49632,BOOK VI.(895),Lords of the storm might joy to meet.
49633,BOOK VI.(895),"He passed within the wondrous pile,"
49634,BOOK VI.(895),Chief glory of the giants' isle:
49635,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus, ere his fiery course be done,"
49636,BOOK VI.(895),An autumn cloud admits the sun.
49637,BOOK VI.(895),He heard auspicious voices raise
49638,BOOK VI.(895),"With loud accord the note of praise,"
49639,BOOK VI.(895),"And sages, deep in Scripture, sing"
49640,BOOK VI.(895),Each glorious triumph of the king.
49641,BOOK VI.(895),"He saw the priests in order stand,"
49642,BOOK VI.(895),"Curd, oil, in every sacred hand;"
49643,BOOK VI.(895),"And by them flowers were laid and grain,"
49644,BOOK VI.(895),Due offerings to the holy train.
49645,BOOK VI.(895),"Vibhishan to the monarch bowed,"
49646,BOOK VI.(895),Raised on a throne above the crowd:
49647,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, skilled in arts of soft address,"
49648,BOOK VI.(895),"He raised his voice the king to bless,"
49649,BOOK VI.(895),And sate him on a seat where he
49650,BOOK VI.(895),Full in his brother's sight should be.
49651,BOOK VI.(895),"The chieftain there, while none could hear,"
49652,BOOK VI.(895),"Spoke his true speech for Rávan's ear,"
49653,BOOK VI.(895),And to his words of wisdom lent
49654,BOOK VI.(895),The force of weightiest argument:
49655,BOOK VI.(895),
49656,BOOK VI.(895),"""O brother, hear! since Ráma's queen"
49657,BOOK VI.(895),"A captive in thy house has been,"
49658,BOOK VI.(895),Disastrous omens day by day
49659,BOOK VI.(895),Have struck our souls with wild dismay.
49660,BOOK VI.(895),No longer still and strong and clear
49661,BOOK VI.(895),"The flames of sacrifice appear,"
49662,BOOK VI.(895),"But, restless with the frequent spark,"
49663,BOOK VI.(895),Neath clouds of smoke grow faint and dark.
49664,BOOK VI.(895),Our ministering priests turn pale
49665,BOOK VI.(895),"To see their wonted offerings fail,"
49666,BOOK VI.(895),And ants and serpents creep and crawl
49667,BOOK VI.(895),Within the consecrated hall.(916)
49668,BOOK VI.(895),"Dried are the udders of our cows,"
49669,BOOK VI.(895),"Our elephants have juiceless brows,(917)"

49672,BOOK VI.(895),Big tears from mules and camels flow
49673,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose staring coats their trouble show,"
49674,BOOK VI.(895),Nor can the leech's art restore
49675,BOOK VI.(895),Their health and vigour as before.
49676,BOOK VI.(895),Rapacious birds are fierce and bold:
49677,BOOK VI.(895),"Not single hunters as of old,"
49678,BOOK VI.(895),"In banded troops they chase the prey,"
49679,BOOK VI.(895),Or gathering on our temples stay.
49680,BOOK VI.(895),Through twilight hours with shriek and howl
49681,BOOK VI.(895),"Around the city jackals prowl,"
49682,BOOK VI.(895),And wolves and foul hyćnas wait
49683,BOOK VI.(895),Athirst for blood at every gate.
49684,BOOK VI.(895),One sole atonement still may cure
49685,BOOK VI.(895),"These evils, and our weal assure."
49686,BOOK VI.(895),"Restore the Maithil dame, and win"

49688,BOOK VI.(895),
49689,BOOK VI.(895),"The Rákshas monarch heard, and moved"
49690,BOOK VI.(895),To sudden wrath his speech reproved:
49691,BOOK VI.(895),
49692,BOOK VI.(895),"""No danger, brother, can I see:"
49693,BOOK VI.(895),The Maithil dame I will not free.
49694,BOOK VI.(895),"Though all the Gods for Ráma fight,"
49695,BOOK VI.(895),"He yields to my superior might."""
49696,BOOK VI.(895),Thus the tremendous king who broke
49697,BOOK VI.(895),"The ranks of heavenly warriors spoke,"
49698,BOOK VI.(895),"And, sternly purposed to resist,"
49699,BOOK VI.(895),His brother from the hall dismissed.

49708,BOOK VI.(895),"The counsel of the wise repelled,"
49709,BOOK VI.(895),"And, as his breast with passion burned,"
49710,BOOK VI.(895),His thoughts again to Sítá turned.
49711,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus, to each sign of danger blind,"
49712,BOOK VI.(895),To love and war he still inclined.
49713,BOOK VI.(895),Then mounted he his car that glowed
49714,BOOK VI.(895),"With gems and golden net, and rode"
49715,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, gathered at the monarch's call,"
49716,BOOK VI.(895),The nobles filled the council hall.
49717,BOOK VI.(895),A host of warriors bright and gay
49718,BOOK VI.(895),"With coloured robes and rich array,"
49719,BOOK VI.(895),"With shield and mace and spear and sword,"
49720,BOOK VI.(895),Followed the chariot of their lord.
49721,BOOK VI.(895),Mid the loud voice of shells and beat
49722,BOOK VI.(895),"Of drums he raced along the street,"
49723,BOOK VI.(895),"And, ere he came, was heard afar"
49724,BOOK VI.(895),The rolling thunder of his car.
49725,BOOK VI.(895),He reached the doors: the nobles bent
49726,BOOK VI.(895),Their heads before him reverent:
49727,BOOK VI.(895),"And, welcomed with their loud acclaim,"
49728,BOOK VI.(895),Within the glorious hall he came.
49729,BOOK VI.(895),He sat upon a royal seat
49730,BOOK VI.(895),"With golden steps beneath his feet,"
49731,BOOK VI.(895),And bade the heralds summon all
49732,BOOK VI.(895),His captains to the council hall.
49733,BOOK VI.(895),"The heralds heard the words he spake,"
49734,BOOK VI.(895),And sped from house to house to wake
49735,BOOK VI.(895),The giants where they slept or spent
49736,BOOK VI.(895),The careless hours in merriment.
49737,BOOK VI.(895),These heard the summons and obeyed:
49738,BOOK VI.(895),"From chamber, grove, and colonnade,"
49739,BOOK VI.(895),"On elephants or cars they rode,"
49740,BOOK VI.(895),Or through the streets impatient strode.
49741,BOOK VI.(895),As birds on rustling pinions fly
49742,BOOK VI.(895),"Through regions of the darkened sky,"
49743,BOOK VI.(895),Thus cars and mettled coursers through
49744,BOOK VI.(895),The crowded streets of Lanká flew.
49745,BOOK VI.(895),"The council hall was reached, and then,"
49746,BOOK VI.(895),"As lions seek their mountain den,"
49747,BOOK VI.(895),"Through massy doors that opened wide,"
49748,BOOK VI.(895),With martial stalk the captains hied.
49749,BOOK VI.(895),Welcomed with honour as was meet
49750,BOOK VI.(895),"They stooped to press their monarch's feet,"
49751,BOOK VI.(895),And each a place in order found
49752,BOOK VI.(895),"On stool, on cushion, or the ground."
49753,BOOK VI.(895),Nor did the sage Vibhishan long
49754,BOOK VI.(895),Delay to join the noble throng.
49755,BOOK VI.(895),High on a car that shone like flame
49756,BOOK VI.(895),"With gold and flashing gems he came,"
49757,BOOK VI.(895),"Drew near and spoke his name aloud,"

49780,BOOK VI.(895),"""Each inlet to the town is closed"
49781,BOOK VI.(895),"Without, within, are troops disposed."
49782,BOOK VI.(895),With fearless heart thine aim pursue
49783,BOOK VI.(895),"And do the deed thou hast in view."""
49784,BOOK VI.(895),
49785,BOOK VI.(895),Thus spoke Prahasta in the zeal
49786,BOOK VI.(895),That moved him for the kingdom's weal.
49787,BOOK VI.(895),"And thus the monarch, who pursued"
49788,BOOK VI.(895),"His own delight, his speech renewed:"

49796,BOOK VI.(895),Give joy and endless fame to me.
49797,BOOK VI.(895),"My secret counsel have I kept,"
49798,BOOK VI.(895),While senseless Kumbhakarna slept.
49799,BOOK VI.(895),Six months the warrior's slumbers last
49800,BOOK VI.(895),And bind his torpid senses fast;
49801,BOOK VI.(895),"But now his deep repose he breaks,"

49804,BOOK VI.(895),This daughter of Videha's king.
49805,BOOK VI.(895),And brought her from that distant land(920)
49806,BOOK VI.(895),Where wandered many a Rákshas band.
49807,BOOK VI.(895),"Disdainful still my love she spurns,"
49808,BOOK VI.(895),"Still from each prayer and offering turns,"
49809,BOOK VI.(895),Yet in all lands beneath the sun
49810,BOOK VI.(895),"No dame may rival Sítá, none,"
49811,BOOK VI.(895),"Her dainty waist is round and slight,"
49812,BOOK VI.(895),"Her cheek like autumn's moon is bright,"
49813,BOOK VI.(895),And she like fruit in graven gold
49814,BOOK VI.(895),Mocks her(921) whom Maya framed of old.
49815,BOOK VI.(895),"Faultless in form, how firmly tread"
49816,BOOK VI.(895),Her feet whose soles are rosy red!
49817,BOOK VI.(895),"Ah, as I gaze her beauty takes"
49818,BOOK VI.(895),"My spirit, and my passion wakes."
49819,BOOK VI.(895),Looking for Ráma far away
49820,BOOK VI.(895),She sought with tears a year's delay
49821,BOOK VI.(895),Nor gazing on her love-lit eye
49822,BOOK VI.(895),Could I that earnest prayer deny.

49825,BOOK VI.(895),How shall the sons of Raghu sweep
49826,BOOK VI.(895),To vengeance o'er the pathless deep?
49827,BOOK VI.(895),How shall they lead the Vánar train
49828,BOOK VI.(895),Across the monster-teeming main?
49829,BOOK VI.(895),One Vánar yet could find a way

49835,BOOK VI.(895),Assailed by you the Gods who dwell

49856,BOOK VI.(895),Then was the time to bid us scan
49857,BOOK VI.(895),Each peril and mature a plan.
49858,BOOK VI.(895),"Blest is the king who acts with heed,"
49859,BOOK VI.(895),And ne'er repents one hasty deed;
49860,BOOK VI.(895),And hapless he whose troubled soul
49861,BOOK VI.(895),Mourns over days beyond control.
49862,BOOK VI.(895),"Thou hast, in beauty's toils ensnared,"

49924,BOOK VI.(895),One day--a day I never forget--
49925,BOOK VI.(895),"Fair Punjikasthalá(922) I met,"
49926,BOOK VI.(895),"When, radiant as a flame of fire,"
49927,BOOK VI.(895),She sought the palace of the Sire.
49928,BOOK VI.(895),In passion's eager grasp I tore
49929,BOOK VI.(895),"From her sweet limbs the robes she wore,"
49930,BOOK VI.(895),And heedless of her prayers and cries
49931,BOOK VI.(895),Strained to my breast the vanquised prize.
49932,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Naliní(923) with soil distained,"
49933,BOOK VI.(895),"The mansion of the Sire she gained,"
49934,BOOK VI.(895),And weeping made the outrage known
49935,BOOK VI.(895),To Brahmá on his heavenly throne.
49936,BOOK VI.(895),"He in his wrath pronounced a curse,--"
49937,BOOK VI.(895),That lord who made the universe:
49938,BOOK VI.(895),"""If, Rávan, thou a second time"
49939,BOOK VI.(895),"Be guilty of so foul a crime,"
49940,BOOK VI.(895),Thy head in shivers shall be rent:
49941,BOOK VI.(895),"Be warned, and dread the punishment."""
49942,BOOK VI.(895),Awed by the threat of vengeance still
49943,BOOK VI.(895),I force not Sítá's stubborn will.
49944,BOOK VI.(895),Terrific as the sea in might:
49945,BOOK VI.(895),My steps are like the Storm-Gods' flight;
49946,BOOK VI.(895),"But Ráma knows not this, or he"
49947,BOOK VI.(895),Had never sought to war with me.
49948,BOOK VI.(895),Where is the man would idly brave
49949,BOOK VI.(895),"The lion in his mountain cave,"
49950,BOOK VI.(895),And wake him when with slumbering eyes
49951,BOOK VI.(895),"Grim, terrible as Death, he lies?"
49952,BOOK VI.(895),"No, blinded Ráma knows me not:"
49953,BOOK VI.(895),Ne'er has he seen mine arrows shot;
49954,BOOK VI.(895),Ne'er marked them speeding to their aim
49955,BOOK VI.(895),Like snakes with cloven tongues of flame.
49956,BOOK VI.(895),"On him those arrows will I turn,"
49957,BOOK VI.(895),Whose fiery points shall rend and burn.
49958,BOOK VI.(895),Quenched by my power when I assail
49959,BOOK VI.(895),"The glory of his might shall fail,"
49960,BOOK VI.(895),As stars before the sun grow dim
49961,BOOK VI.(895),"And yield their feeble light to him."""

49968,BOOK VI.(895),
49969,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: Vibhishan ill at ease
49970,BOOK VI.(895),Addressed the king in words like these:
49971,BOOK VI.(895),
49972,BOOK VI.(895),"""O Rávan, O my lord, beware"
49973,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Sítá dangerous as fair,"
49974,BOOK VI.(895),Nor on thy heedless bosom hang
49975,BOOK VI.(895),This serpent with a deadly fang.
49976,BOOK VI.(895),"O King, the Maithil dame restore"
49977,BOOK VI.(895),To Raghu's matchless son before
49978,BOOK VI.(895),"Those warriors of the woodlands, vast"

49981,BOOK VI.(895),Thy city with unsparing foes.
49982,BOOK VI.(895),"O, be the Maithil dame restored"
49983,BOOK VI.(895),Ere loosened from the clanging cord
49984,BOOK VI.(895),"The vengeful shafts of Ráma fly,"
49985,BOOK VI.(895),And low in death thy princes lie.
49986,BOOK VI.(895),In all thy legions hast thou one
49987,BOOK VI.(895),A match in war for Raghu's son?
49988,BOOK VI.(895),"Can Kumbhakarna's self withstand,"
49989,BOOK VI.(895),"Or Indrajít, that mighty hand?"
49990,BOOK VI.(895),In vain with Ráma wilt thou strive:

49992,BOOK VI.(895),Though guarded by the Lord of Day
49993,BOOK VI.(895),"And Storm-Gods' terrible array,"
49994,BOOK VI.(895),"In vain to Indra wilt thou fly,"
49995,BOOK VI.(895),"Or seek protection in the sky,"
49996,BOOK VI.(895),"In Yáma's gloomy mansion dwell,"
49997,BOOK VI.(895),"Or hide thee in the depths of hell."""
49998,BOOK VI.(895),
49999,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased; and when his lips were closed
50000,BOOK VI.(895),Prahasta thus his rede opposed:
50001,BOOK VI.(895),
50002,BOOK VI.(895),"""O timid heart, to counsel thus!"
50003,BOOK VI.(895),What terrors have the Gods for us?
50004,BOOK VI.(895),"Can snake, Gandharva, fiend appal"

50006,BOOK VI.(895),"And shall we now our birth disgrace,"
50007,BOOK VI.(895),"And dread a king of human race?"""
50008,BOOK VI.(895),Thus fierce Prahasta counselled ill:
50009,BOOK VI.(895),But sage Vibhishan's constant will
50010,BOOK VI.(895),The safety of the realm ensued;
50011,BOOK VI.(895),Who thus in turn his speech renewed:
50012,BOOK VI.(895),
50013,BOOK VI.(895),"""Yes, when a soul defiled with sin"
50014,BOOK VI.(895),"Shall mount to heaven and enter in,"
50015,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, chieftain, will experience teach"
50016,BOOK VI.(895),The truth of thy disdainful speech.
50017,BOOK VI.(895),"Can I, or thou, or these or all"
50018,BOOK VI.(895),"Our bravest compass Ráma's fall,"
50019,BOOK VI.(895),"The chief in whom all virtues shine,"

50023,BOOK VI.(895),"Yea, idly mayst thou vaunt thee, till"
50024,BOOK VI.(895),Sharp arrows winged with matchless skill

50026,BOOK VI.(895),"As lightning's flame, thy body pierce."
50027,BOOK VI.(895),"Nikumbha shall not save thee then,"
50028,BOOK VI.(895),"Nor Rávan, from the lord of men."
50029,BOOK VI.(895),"O Monarch, hear my last appeal,"
50030,BOOK VI.(895),My counsel for thy kingdom's weal.
50031,BOOK VI.(895),This sentence I again declare:
50032,BOOK VI.(895),"O giant King, beware, beware!"
50033,BOOK VI.(895),Save from the ruin that impends
50034,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy town, thy people, and thy friends;"

50045,BOOK VI.(895),Of Rákshas warriors thus replied:
50046,BOOK VI.(895),
50047,BOOK VI.(895),"""Is this a speech our king should hear,"
50048,BOOK VI.(895),This counsel of ignoble fear?
50049,BOOK VI.(895),A scion of our glorious race
50050,BOOK VI.(895),"Should ne'er conceive a thought so base,"
50051,BOOK VI.(895),"But one mid all our kin we find,"
50052,BOOK VI.(895),"Vibhishan, whose degenerate mind"
50053,BOOK VI.(895),"No spark of gallant pride retains,"
50054,BOOK VI.(895),Whose coward soul his lineage stains.
50055,BOOK VI.(895),Against one giant what can two
50056,BOOK VI.(895),Unhappy sons of Raghu do?
50057,BOOK VI.(895),"Away with idle fears, away!"
50058,BOOK VI.(895),"Matched with our meanest, what are they?"
50059,BOOK VI.(895),Beneath my conquering prowess fell
50060,BOOK VI.(895),The Lord of earth and heaven and hell.(924)
50061,BOOK VI.(895),Through every startled region dread
50062,BOOK VI.(895),Of my resistless fury spread;
50063,BOOK VI.(895),And Gods in each remotest sphere
50064,BOOK VI.(895),Confessed the universal fear.
50065,BOOK VI.(895),"Rending the air with roar and groan,"
50066,BOOK VI.(895),Airávat(925) to the earth was thrown.

50070,BOOK VI.(895),"By whom the fiends are terrified,"
50071,BOOK VI.(895),"Now prove a weakling little worth,"
50072,BOOK VI.(895),"And fail to slay those sons of earth?"""
50073,BOOK VI.(895),
50074,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: Vibhishan trained and tried
50075,BOOK VI.(895),In war and counsel thus replied
50076,BOOK VI.(895),
50077,BOOK VI.(895),"""Thy speech is marked with scorn of truth,"
50078,BOOK VI.(895),With rashness and the pride of youth.
50079,BOOK VI.(895),"Yea, to thy ruin like a child"
50080,BOOK VI.(895),"Thou pratest, and thy words are wild."
50081,BOOK VI.(895),"Most dear, O Indrajít, to thee"

50083,BOOK VI.(895),"For thou art called his son, but thou"
50084,BOOK VI.(895),"Art proved his direst foeman now,"
50085,BOOK VI.(895),When warned by me thou hast not tried
50086,BOOK VI.(895),To turn the coming woe aside.

50088,BOOK VI.(895),"Who brought thee to this hall to-day,"
50089,BOOK VI.(895),And dared so rash a youth admit
50090,BOOK VI.(895),To council where the wisest sit.
50091,BOOK VI.(895),"Presumptuous, wild, devoid of sense,"
50092,BOOK VI.(895),"Filled full of pride and insolence,"
50093,BOOK VI.(895),Thy reckless tongue thou wilt not rule
50094,BOOK VI.(895),That speaks the counsel of a fool.
50095,BOOK VI.(895),Who in the fight may brook or shun
50096,BOOK VI.(895),The arrows shot by Raghu's son
50097,BOOK VI.(895),"With flame and fiery vengeance sped,"

50137,BOOK VI.(895),What though the worlds in abject fear
50138,BOOK VI.(895),Their mighty lord in me revere?
50139,BOOK VI.(895),This thought my peace of mind destroys
50140,BOOK VI.(895),And robs me of expected joys.
50141,BOOK VI.(895),The lotus of the lake receives
50142,BOOK VI.(895),"The glittering rain that gems its leaves,"
50143,BOOK VI.(895),But each bright drop remains apart:
50144,BOOK VI.(895),So is it still with heart and heart.
50145,BOOK VI.(895),Deceitful as an autumn cloud
50146,BOOK VI.(895),"Which, though its thunderous voice be loud,"
50147,BOOK VI.(895),"On the dry earth no torrent sends,"
50148,BOOK VI.(895),Such is the race of faithless friends.
50149,BOOK VI.(895),No riches of the bloomy spray
50150,BOOK VI.(895),Will tempt the wandering bee to stay

50152,BOOK VI.(895),And friends like thee are swift to change.
50153,BOOK VI.(895),"Thou blot upon thy glorious line,"
50154,BOOK VI.(895),If any giant's tongue but thine

50160,BOOK VI.(895),And with four captains of the band
50161,BOOK VI.(895),Sprang forward with his mace in hand;
50162,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, fury flashing from his eye,"
50163,BOOK VI.(895),Looked on the king and made reply:

50175,BOOK VI.(895),"A thousand courtiers wilt thou meet,"

50177,BOOK VI.(895),But rare are they whose tongue or ear
50178,BOOK VI.(895),"Will speak the bitter truth, or hear."
50179,BOOK VI.(895),Unclose thy blinded eyes and see
50180,BOOK VI.(895),That snares of death encompass thee.

50197,BOOK VI.(895),To Raghu's sons Vibhishan fled.(927)
50198,BOOK VI.(895),Their eyes the Vánar leaders raised
50199,BOOK VI.(895),"And on the air-borne Rákhshas gazed,"
50200,BOOK VI.(895),"Bright as a thunderbolt, in size"
50201,BOOK VI.(895),Like Meru's peak that cleaves the skies.
50202,BOOK VI.(895),In gorgeous panoply arrayed
50203,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Indra's self he stood displayed,"
50204,BOOK VI.(895),And four attendants brave and bold
50205,BOOK VI.(895),Shone by their chief in mail and gold.
50206,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva then with dark surmise
50207,BOOK VI.(895),"Bent on their forms his wondering eyes,"
50208,BOOK VI.(895),And thus in hasty words confessed
50209,BOOK VI.(895),The anxious doubt that moved his breast:
50210,BOOK VI.(895),
50211,BOOK VI.(895),"""Look, look ye Vánars, and beware:"
50212,BOOK VI.(895),That giant chief sublime in air

50215,BOOK VI.(895),"Soon as his warning speech they heard,"
50216,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar chieftains undeterred
50217,BOOK VI.(895),"Seized fragments of the rock and trees,"
50218,BOOK VI.(895),And made reply in words like these:
50219,BOOK VI.(895),"""We wait thy word: the order give,"

50223,BOOK VI.(895),
50224,BOOK VI.(895),Meanwhile Vibhishan with the four
50225,BOOK VI.(895),Stood high above the ocean shore.
50226,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva and the chiefs he spied,"
50227,BOOK VI.(895),And raised his mighty voice and cried:

50232,BOOK VI.(895),And in his palace locked and barred
50233,BOOK VI.(895),Surrounds her with a Rákshas guard.

50240,BOOK VI.(895),"He scorned the sage advice I gave,"
50241,BOOK VI.(895),He spurned me like a base-born slave.
50242,BOOK VI.(895),"I left my children and my wife,"

50609,BOOK VI.(895),"He stood above the Vánar king,"
50610,BOOK VI.(895),"And spoke aloud, sublime in air,"
50611,BOOK VI.(895),The message he was charged to bear.
50612,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánar heard the words he spoke,"
50613,BOOK VI.(895),And quick redoubling stroke on stroke
50614,BOOK VI.(895),On head and pinions hemmed him round
50615,BOOK VI.(895),And bore him struggling to the ground.
50616,BOOK VI.(895),The Rákshas wounded and distressed
50617,BOOK VI.(895),These words to Raghu's son addressed:
50618,BOOK VI.(895),
50619,BOOK VI.(895),"""Quick, quick! This Vánar host restrain,"
50620,BOOK VI.(895),For heralds never must be slain.
50621,BOOK VI.(895),"To him alone, a wretch untrue,"
50622,BOOK VI.(895),The punishment of death is due
50623,BOOK VI.(895),Who leaves his master's speech unsaid
50624,BOOK VI.(895),"And speaks another in its stead."""
50625,BOOK VI.(895),Moved by the suppliant speech and prayer
50626,BOOK VI.(895),"Up sprang the prince and cried, forbear."
50627,BOOK VI.(895),Saved from his wild assailant's blows
50628,BOOK VI.(895),Again the Rákshas herald rose
50629,BOOK VI.(895),And borne on light wings to the sky
50630,BOOK VI.(895),Addressed Sugríva from on high:
50631,BOOK VI.(895),"""O Vánar Monarch, chief endued"
50632,BOOK VI.(895),"With power and wonderous fortitude,"
50633,BOOK VI.(895),"What answer is my king, the fear"
50634,BOOK VI.(895),"And scourge of weeping worlds, to hear?"""
50635,BOOK VI.(895),"""Go tell thy lord,"" Sugríva cried,"
50636,BOOK VI.(895),"""Thou, Ráma's foe, art thus defied."

50638,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus, tyrant, shalt thou perish too."
50639,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy sons, thy friends, proud King, and all"
50640,BOOK VI.(895),Thy kith and kin with thee shall fall;

50642,BOOK VI.(895),Burnt Lanká be a solitude.
50643,BOOK VI.(895),"Fly to the Sun-God's pathway, go"
50644,BOOK VI.(895),And hide thee deep in hell below:
50645,BOOK VI.(895),In vain from Ráma shalt thou flee
50646,BOOK VI.(895),Though heavenly warriors fight for thee.
50647,BOOK VI.(895),"Thine arm subdued, securely bold,"
50648,BOOK VI.(895),The Vulture-king infirm and old:
50649,BOOK VI.(895),But will thy puny strength avail
50650,BOOK VI.(895),When Raghu's wrathful sons assail?
50651,BOOK VI.(895),A captive in thy palace lies
50652,BOOK VI.(895),The lady of the lotus eyes:
50653,BOOK VI.(895),Thou knowest not how fierce and strong
50654,BOOK VI.(895),Is he whom thou hast dared to wrong.
50655,BOOK VI.(895),"The best of Raghu's lineage, he"
50656,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose conquering hand shall punish thee."""
50657,BOOK VI.(895),
50658,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: and Angad raised a cry;

50660,BOOK VI.(895),Above thee from his airy post
50661,BOOK VI.(895),"His rapid eye surveyed our host,"
50662,BOOK VI.(895),Where with advantage he might scan
50663,BOOK VI.(895),Our gathered strength from rear to van.
50664,BOOK VI.(895),"Bind him, Vánars, bind the spy,"
50665,BOOK VI.(895),"Nor let him back to Lanká fly."""
50666,BOOK VI.(895),
50667,BOOK VI.(895),"They hurled the Rákshas to the ground,"
50668,BOOK VI.(895),"They grasped his neck, his pinions bound,"
50669,BOOK VI.(895),And firmly held him while in vain
50670,BOOK VI.(895),His voice was lifted to complain.
50671,BOOK VI.(895),"But Ráma's heart inclined to spare,"
50672,BOOK VI.(895),"He listened to his plaint and prayer,"
50673,BOOK VI.(895),"And cried aloud: ""O Vánars, cease;"

50681,BOOK VI.(895),
50682,BOOK VI.(895),His hands in reverence Ráma raised
50683,BOOK VI.(895),And southward o'er the ocean gazed;
50684,BOOK VI.(895),Then on the sacred grass that made
50685,BOOK VI.(895),His lowly couch his limbs he laid.
50686,BOOK VI.(895),His head on that strong arm reclined
50687,BOOK VI.(895),"Which Sítá, best of womankind,"
50688,BOOK VI.(895),Had loved in happier days to hold
50689,BOOK VI.(895),With soft arms decked with pearls and gold.
50690,BOOK VI.(895),"Then rising from his bed of grass,"
50691,BOOK VI.(895),"""This day,"" he cried, ""the host shall pass"
50692,BOOK VI.(895),"Triumphant to the southern shore,"

50695,BOOK VI.(895),"Again he turned him to his rest,"
50696,BOOK VI.(895),"And there, his eyes in slumber closed,"
50697,BOOK VI.(895),Silent beside the sea reposed.
50698,BOOK VI.(895),"Thrice rose the Day-God thrice he set,"
50699,BOOK VI.(895),"The lord of Ocean came not yet,"
50700,BOOK VI.(895),"Thrice came the night, but Raghu's son"
50701,BOOK VI.(895),No answer by his service won.
50702,BOOK VI.(895),"To Lakshman thus the hero cried,"

50705,BOOK VI.(895),"""In vain the softer gifts that grace"
50706,BOOK VI.(895),The good are offered to the base.
50707,BOOK VI.(895),"Long-suffering, patience, gentle speech"
50708,BOOK VI.(895),Their thankless hearts can never reach.
50709,BOOK VI.(895),The world to him its honour pays
50710,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose ready tongue himself can praise,"
50711,BOOK VI.(895),"Who scorns the true, and hates the right,"
50712,BOOK VI.(895),Whose hand is ever raised to smite.
50713,BOOK VI.(895),Each milder art is tried in vain:
50714,BOOK VI.(895),"It wins no glory, but disdain."
50715,BOOK VI.(895),And victory owns no softer charm
50716,BOOK VI.(895),Than might which nerves a warrior's arm.
50717,BOOK VI.(895),My humble suit is still denied

50719,BOOK VI.(895),This day the monsters of the deep
50720,BOOK VI.(895),In throes of death shall wildly leap.
50721,BOOK VI.(895),My shafts shall rend the serpents curled

50723,BOOK VI.(895),Disclose each sunless depth and bare
50724,BOOK VI.(895),The tangled pearl and coral there.
50725,BOOK VI.(895),Away with mercy! at a time
50726,BOOK VI.(895),Like this compassion is a crime.

50732,BOOK VI.(895),"Shall tremble to his farthest shore."""
50733,BOOK VI.(895),
50734,BOOK VI.(895),Red flashed his eyes with angry glow:
50735,BOOK VI.(895),"He stood and grasped his mighty bow,"
50736,BOOK VI.(895),Terrific as the fire of doom
50737,BOOK VI.(895),Whose quenchless flames the world consume.
50738,BOOK VI.(895),"His clanging cord the archer drew,"
50739,BOOK VI.(895),And swift the fiery arrows flew
50740,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce as the flashing levin sent
50741,BOOK VI.(895),By him who rules the firmament.
50742,BOOK VI.(895),Down through the startled waters sped
50743,BOOK VI.(895),Each missile with its flaming head.
50744,BOOK VI.(895),"The foamy billows rose and sank,"
50745,BOOK VI.(895),And dashed upon the trembling bank.
50746,BOOK VI.(895),Sea monsters of tremendous form
50747,BOOK VI.(895),With crash and roar of thunder storm.
50748,BOOK VI.(895),Still the wild waters rose and fell
50749,BOOK VI.(895),Crowned with white foam and pearl and shell.
50750,BOOK VI.(895),"Each serpent, startled from his rest,"
50751,BOOK VI.(895),Raised his fierce eyes and glowing crest.
50752,BOOK VI.(895),And prisoned Dánavs(933) where they dwelt
50753,BOOK VI.(895),In depths below the terror felt.
50754,BOOK VI.(895),Again upon his string he laid
50755,BOOK VI.(895),"A flaming shaft, but Lakshman stayed"

50790,BOOK VI.(895),"Through echoing skies the thunder pealed,"
50791,BOOK VI.(895),"And startled mountains rocked and reeled,"
50792,BOOK VI.(895),The earth was black with sudden night
50793,BOOK VI.(895),And heaven was blotted from the sight.
50794,BOOK VI.(895),Then ever and anon the glare
50795,BOOK VI.(895),"Of meteors shot through murky air,"
50796,BOOK VI.(895),And with a wild terrific sound
50797,BOOK VI.(895),Red lightnings struck the trembling ground.
50798,BOOK VI.(895),In furious gusts the fierce wind blew:
50799,BOOK VI.(895),"Tall trees it shattered and o'erthrew,"
50800,BOOK VI.(895),"And, smiting with a giant's stroke,"
50801,BOOK VI.(895),Huge masses from the mountain broke.
50802,BOOK VI.(895),A cry of terror long and shrill
50803,BOOK VI.(895),"Came from each valley, plain, and hill."
50804,BOOK VI.(895),"Each ruined dale, each riven peak"
50805,BOOK VI.(895),Re-echoed with a wail or shriek.
50806,BOOK VI.(895),

50813,BOOK VI.(895),Then from the seething flood upreared
50814,BOOK VI.(895),"Majestic Ocean's form appeared,"
50815,BOOK VI.(895),As rising from his eastern height
50816,BOOK VI.(895),Springs through the sky the Lord of Light.
50817,BOOK VI.(895),Attendant on their monarch came
50818,BOOK VI.(895),Sea serpents with their eyes aflame.
50819,BOOK VI.(895),Like lazulite mid burning gold

50821,BOOK VI.(895),Bright with each fairest precious stone
50822,BOOK VI.(895),A chain about his neck was thrown.
50823,BOOK VI.(895),Calm shone his lotus eyes beneath

50866,BOOK VI.(895),"Earth groaned to feel the wound, and sent"
50867,BOOK VI.(895),A rush of water through the rent;
50868,BOOK VI.(895),And famed for ever is the well
50869,BOOK VI.(895),Of Vrana(937) where the arrow fell.
50870,BOOK VI.(895),Then every brook and lake beside
50871,BOOK VI.(895),Throughout the region Ráma dried.
50872,BOOK VI.(895),But yet he gave a boon to bless
50873,BOOK VI.(895),And fertilize the wilderness:
50874,BOOK VI.(895),"No fell disease should taint the air,"
50875,BOOK VI.(895),And sheep and kine should prosper there:
50876,BOOK VI.(895),"Earth should produce each pleasant root,"
50877,BOOK VI.(895),The stately trees should bend with fruit;
50878,BOOK VI.(895),"Oil, milk, and honey should abound,"
50879,BOOK VI.(895),And fragrant herbs should clothe the ground.
50880,BOOK VI.(895),Then spake the king of brooks and seas

50949,BOOK VI.(895),And chafed impatient at delay.
50950,BOOK VI.(895),Then thus to Ráma trained and tried
50951,BOOK VI.(895),In battle King Sugríva cried:
50952,BOOK VI.(895),"""Come, Hanumán's broad back ascend;"
50953,BOOK VI.(895),Let Angad help to Lakshman lend.
50954,BOOK VI.(895),These high above the sea shall bear

50956,BOOK VI.(895),
50957,BOOK VI.(895),"So, with Sugríva, borne o'erhead"
50958,BOOK VI.(895),Ikshváku's sons the legions led.
50959,BOOK VI.(895),"Behind, the Vánar hosts pursued"
50960,BOOK VI.(895),Their march in endless multitude.
50961,BOOK VI.(895),"Some skimmed the surface of the wave,"
50962,BOOK VI.(895),To some the air a passage gave.
50963,BOOK VI.(895),Amid their ceaseless roar the sound
50964,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Ocean's fearful voice was drowned,"
50965,BOOK VI.(895),As o'er the bridge by Nala planned
50966,BOOK VI.(895),"They hastened on to Lanká's strand,"
50967,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, by the pleasant brooks, mid trees"
50968,BOOK VI.(895),"Loaded with fruit, they took their ease."

50981,BOOK VI.(895),"In fruitful groves the host divide,"

50994,BOOK VI.(895),Long streaks of lurid light invest
50995,BOOK VI.(895),The evening skies from east to west.
50996,BOOK VI.(895),And from the sun at times a ball
50997,BOOK VI.(895),Of angry fire is seen to fall.
50998,BOOK VI.(895),From every glen and brake is heard

51002,BOOK VI.(895),"Up springs the moon, but hot and red"

51006,BOOK VI.(895),A cloud of dust and vapour mars

51023,BOOK VI.(895),
51024,BOOK VI.(895),
51025,BOOK VI.(895),As shine the heavens with autumn's moon
51026,BOOK VI.(895),"Refulgent in the height of noon,"
51027,BOOK VI.(895),So shone with light which Ráma gave
51028,BOOK VI.(895),"That army of the bold and brave,"
51029,BOOK VI.(895),As from the sea it marched away
51030,BOOK VI.(895),"In war's magnificent array,"
51031,BOOK VI.(895),And earth was shaken by the beat
51032,BOOK VI.(895),And trampling of unnumbered feet.
51033,BOOK VI.(895),"Then to the giants' ears were borne,"
51034,BOOK VI.(895),"The mingled notes of drum and horn,"
51035,BOOK VI.(895),"And clash of tambours smote the sky,"

51039,BOOK VI.(895),"While giants from their walls replied,"
51040,BOOK VI.(895),"And answering shouts the foe defied,"
51041,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma looked on Lanká where
51042,BOOK VI.(895),"Bright banners floated in the air,"
51043,BOOK VI.(895),"And, pierced with anguish at the view,"
51044,BOOK VI.(895),His loving thoughts to Sítá flew.

51055,BOOK VI.(895),Bright from afar the city shines
51056,BOOK VI.(895),"With gleam of palaces and shrines,"

51083,BOOK VI.(895),Showed awful as the autumn sky
51084,BOOK VI.(895),When clouds embattled form on high.
51085,BOOK VI.(895),"Their arms were mighty trees o'erthrown,"
51086,BOOK VI.(895),And massy blocks of mountain stone.
51087,BOOK VI.(895),"One hope in every warlike breast,"
51088,BOOK VI.(895),"One firm resolve, they onward pressed,"
51089,BOOK VI.(895),To die in fight or batter down

51099,BOOK VI.(895),His homeward way to Rávan made.
51100,BOOK VI.(895),Loud laughed the lord of Lanká's isle:

51102,BOOK VI.(895),"Why is thy plumage marred, and why"

51118,BOOK VI.(895),Is the wild forest multitude.
51119,BOOK VI.(895),"There, marshalling the Vánar bands,"

51122,BOOK VI.(895),"Virádha and Kabandha slew,"

51134,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy safety and the Maithil queen."""
51135,BOOK VI.(895),
51136,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: the tyrant's eyeballs blazed

51138,BOOK VI.(895),"""No, if the dwellers of the sky,"
51139,BOOK VI.(895),"Gandharvas, fiends assail me, I"

51292,BOOK VI.(895),Still trembling from the ungentle touch
51293,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Vánar hands ye fear too much,"
51294,BOOK VI.(895),"And bid me, heedless of the shame,"
51295,BOOK VI.(895),"Give to her lord the Maithil dame."""
51296,BOOK VI.(895),
51297,BOOK VI.(895),Thus spoke the king in stern reproof;
51298,BOOK VI.(895),Then mounted to his palace roof
51299,BOOK VI.(895),"Aloft o'er many a story raised,"
51300,BOOK VI.(895),And on the lands beneath him gazed.
51301,BOOK VI.(895),There by his faithful spies he stood
51302,BOOK VI.(895),And looked on sea and hill and wood.
51303,BOOK VI.(895),There stretched before him far away
51304,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánars' numberless array:
51305,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce could the meadows' tender green
51306,BOOK VI.(895),Beneath their trampling feet be seen.
51307,BOOK VI.(895),"He looked a while with furious eye,"
51308,BOOK VI.(895),Then questioned thus the nearer spy:
51309,BOOK VI.(895),"""Bend, Sáran, bend thy gaze, and show"
51310,BOOK VI.(895),The leaders of the Vánar foe.
51311,BOOK VI.(895),"Tell me their heroes' names, and teach"
51312,BOOK VI.(895),"The valour, power and might of each."""
51313,BOOK VI.(895),
51314,BOOK VI.(895),"Obedient Sáran eyed the van,"
51315,BOOK VI.(895),"The leaders marked, and thus began:"
51316,BOOK VI.(895),"""That chief conspicuous at the head"
51317,BOOK VI.(895),"Of warriors in the forest bred,"
51318,BOOK VI.(895),Who hither bends his ruthless eye
51319,BOOK VI.(895),And shouts his fearful battle cry:
51320,BOOK VI.(895),Whose voice with pealing thunder shakes
51321,BOOK VI.(895),"All Lanká, with the groves and lakes"
51322,BOOK VI.(895),"And hills that tremble at the sound,"
51323,BOOK VI.(895),"Is Níla, for his might renowned:"
51324,BOOK VI.(895),First of the Vánar lords controlled
51325,BOOK VI.(895),By King Sugríva lofty-souled.
51326,BOOK VI.(895),"He who his mighty arm extends,"
51327,BOOK VI.(895),"And his fierce eye on Lanká bends,"
51328,BOOK VI.(895),"In stature like a stately tower,"
51329,BOOK VI.(895),"In colour like a lotus flower,"
51330,BOOK VI.(895),Who with his wild earth-shaking cries
51331,BOOK VI.(895),"Thee, Rávan, to the field defies,"
51332,BOOK VI.(895),"Is Angad, by Sugríva's care"
51333,BOOK VI.(895),Anointed his imperial heir:
51334,BOOK VI.(895),"In wondrous strength, in martial fire"
51335,BOOK VI.(895),"Peer of King Báli's self, his sire;"
51336,BOOK VI.(895),For Ráma's sake in arms arrayed
51337,BOOK VI.(895),Like Varun called to Sakra's aid.
51338,BOOK VI.(895),"Behind him, girt by warlike bands,"
51339,BOOK VI.(895),"Nala the mighty Vánar stands,"
51340,BOOK VI.(895),"The son of Visvakarmá, he"
51341,BOOK VI.(895),Who built the bridge athwart the sea.
51342,BOOK VI.(895),"Look farther yet, O King, and mark"
51343,BOOK VI.(895),That chieftain clothed in Sandal bark.
51344,BOOK VI.(895),"'Tis Sweta, famed among his peers,"
51345,BOOK VI.(895),A sage whom all his race reveres.
51346,BOOK VI.(895),"See, in Sugríva's ear he speaks,"
51347,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, hasting back, his post reseeks,"
51348,BOOK VI.(895),And turns his practised eye to view
51349,BOOK VI.(895),The squadrons he has formed anew.
51350,BOOK VI.(895),Next Kumud stands who roamed of yore
51351,BOOK VI.(895),"On Gomatí's(939) delightful shore,"
51352,BOOK VI.(895),Feared where the waving woods invest
51353,BOOK VI.(895),His seat on Mount Sanrochan's crest.
51354,BOOK VI.(895),"Next him a chieftain strong and dread,"
51355,BOOK VI.(895),Comes Chanda at his legions' head;
51356,BOOK VI.(895),Exulting in his warrior might
51357,BOOK VI.(895),"He hastens, burning for the fight,"
51358,BOOK VI.(895),And boasts that his unaided powers
51359,BOOK VI.(895),Shall cast to earth thy walls and towers.
51360,BOOK VI.(895),"Mark, mark that chief of lion gait,"
51361,BOOK VI.(895),Who views thee with a glance of hate
51362,BOOK VI.(895),As though his very eyes would burn
51363,BOOK VI.(895),The city walls to which they turn:
51364,BOOK VI.(895),"'Tis Rambha, Vánar king; he dwells"
51365,BOOK VI.(895),"In Krishnagiri's tangled dells,"
51366,BOOK VI.(895),Where Vindhya's pleasant slopes are spread

51368,BOOK VI.(895),"There, listening with erected ears,"
51369,BOOK VI.(895),"Sarabha, mighty chief, appears."
51370,BOOK VI.(895),"His soul is burning for the strife,"
51371,BOOK VI.(895),Nor dreads the jeopardy of life.
51372,BOOK VI.(895),"He trembles as he moves, for ire,"
51373,BOOK VI.(895),And bends around his glance of fire.
51374,BOOK VI.(895),"Next, like a cloud that veils the skies,"
51375,BOOK VI.(895),"A chieftain of terrific size,"
51376,BOOK VI.(895),"Conspicuous mid the Vánars, comes"
51377,BOOK VI.(895),"With battle shout like rolling drums,"

51386,BOOK VI.(895),That chieftain bending down to drink
51387,BOOK VI.(895),"On lovely Vená's verdant brink,"
51388,BOOK VI.(895),Is Krathan; now he lifts his eyes
51389,BOOK VI.(895),And thee to mortal fray defies.

51565,BOOK VI.(895),"Cried, Long live Rávan, and withdrew,"
51566,BOOK VI.(895),The giant monarch turned and cried

51582,BOOK VI.(895),"Watch keenly all, and come away."""
51583,BOOK VI.(895),
51584,BOOK VI.(895),With joy they heard the words he said:
51585,BOOK VI.(895),Then with Sárdúla at their head
51586,BOOK VI.(895),About the giant king they went
51587,BOOK VI.(895),With circling paces reverent.
51588,BOOK VI.(895),By fair Suvela's grassy side

51590,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, shaded by the waving wood,"
51591,BOOK VI.(895),Vibhishan and Sugríva stood.
51592,BOOK VI.(895),A while they rested there and viewed
51593,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánars' countless multitude.
51594,BOOK VI.(895),Vibhishan with observant eyes
51595,BOOK VI.(895),"Knew at a glance the giant spies,"
51596,BOOK VI.(895),And bade the warriors of his train
51597,BOOK VI.(895),Bind the rash foes with cord and chain:
51598,BOOK VI.(895),"""Sárdúla's is the sin,"" he cried."
51599,BOOK VI.(895),"He neath the Vánars' hands had died,"
51600,BOOK VI.(895),But Ráma from their fury freed
51601,BOOK VI.(895),"The captive in his utmost need,"
51602,BOOK VI.(895),"And, merciful at sight of woe,"
51603,BOOK VI.(895),Loosed all the spies and bade them go.
51604,BOOK VI.(895),Then home to Lanká's monarch fled
51605,BOOK VI.(895),The giant chiefs discomfited.

51614,BOOK VI.(895),Lay waiting by Suvela's hill.
51615,BOOK VI.(895),"The tyrant, flushed with angry glow,"
51616,BOOK VI.(895),"Heard of the coming of the foe,"
51617,BOOK VI.(895),And thus with close inquiry pressed

51619,BOOK VI.(895),"""Why art thou sad, night-rover? speak:"

51623,BOOK VI.(895),
51624,BOOK VI.(895),"Sárdúla heard, but scarce might speak;"
51625,BOOK VI.(895),His trembling tones were faint and weak:
51626,BOOK VI.(895),"""O Giant King, in vain we try"
51627,BOOK VI.(895),The purpose of the foe to spy.
51628,BOOK VI.(895),"Their strength and number none may tell,"
51629,BOOK VI.(895),And Ráma guards his legions well.
51630,BOOK VI.(895),"He leaves no hope to prying eyes,"

51632,BOOK VI.(895),"Each road and path a Vánar guard,"
51633,BOOK VI.(895),"Of mountain size, has closed and barred."
51634,BOOK VI.(895),Soon as my feet an entrance found
51635,BOOK VI.(895),"By giants was I seized and bound,"
51636,BOOK VI.(895),And wounded sore I fell beneath
51637,BOOK VI.(895),Their fists and knees and hands and teeth.
51638,BOOK VI.(895),"Then trembling, bleeding, wellnigh dead"
51639,BOOK VI.(895),To Ráma's presence was I led.
51640,BOOK VI.(895),"He in his mercy stooped to save,"
51641,BOOK VI.(895),And freedom to the captive gave.
51642,BOOK VI.(895),With rocks and shattered mountains he
51643,BOOK VI.(895),"Has bridged his way athwart the sea,"
51644,BOOK VI.(895),And he and all his legions wait
51645,BOOK VI.(895),Embattled close to Lanká's gate.

51647,BOOK VI.(895),"And, swarming on, the rampart scale."
51648,BOOK VI.(895),"Now, O my King, his consort yield,"

51658,BOOK VI.(895),
51659,BOOK VI.(895),The tyrant's troubled eye confessed
51660,BOOK VI.(895),The secret fear that filled his breast.
51661,BOOK VI.(895),With dread of coming woe dismayed
51662,BOOK VI.(895),He called his counsellors to aid;
51663,BOOK VI.(895),"Then sternly silent, deep in thought,"
51664,BOOK VI.(895),His chamber in the palace sought.
51665,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, as the surest hope of all,"
51666,BOOK VI.(895),The monarch bade his servants call
51667,BOOK VI.(895),"Vidyujjihva, whom magic skill"
51668,BOOK VI.(895),Made master of the means of ill.
51669,BOOK VI.(895),Then spake the lord of Lanká's isle:
51670,BOOK VI.(895),"""Come, Sítá with thine arts beguile."
51671,BOOK VI.(895),With magic skill and deftest care
51672,BOOK VI.(895),A head like Ráma's own prepare.
51673,BOOK VI.(895),"This head, long shafts and mighty bow,"
51674,BOOK VI.(895),"To Janak's daughter will we show."""
51675,BOOK VI.(895),
51676,BOOK VI.(895),"He ceased: Vidyujjihva obeyed,"
51677,BOOK VI.(895),And wondrous magic skill displayed;
51678,BOOK VI.(895),And Rávan for the art he showed
51679,BOOK VI.(895),An ornament of price bestowed.
51680,BOOK VI.(895),Then to the grove where Sítá lay
51681,BOOK VI.(895),The lord of Lanká took his way.
51682,BOOK VI.(895),"Pale, wasted, weeping, on the ground"
51683,BOOK VI.(895),"The melancholy queen he found,"
51684,BOOK VI.(895),Whose thoughts in utmost stress of ill
51685,BOOK VI.(895),Were fixed upon her husband still.
51686,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant king approached the dame,"
51687,BOOK VI.(895),Declared in tones of joy his name;
51688,BOOK VI.(895),Then heeding naught her wild distress
51689,BOOK VI.(895),"Bespake her, stern and pitiless:"
51690,BOOK VI.(895),"""The prince to whom thy fancies cling"
51691,BOOK VI.(895),"Though loved and wooed by Lanká's king,"

51694,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy living root is hewn away,"
51695,BOOK VI.(895),Thy scornful pride is tamed to-day.
51696,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy lord in battle's front has died,"
51697,BOOK VI.(895),And Sítá shall be Rávan's bride.
51698,BOOK VI.(895),"Hence, idle thoughts: thy hope is fled;"
51699,BOOK VI.(895),"What wilt thou, Sítá, with the dead?"
51700,BOOK VI.(895),"Rise, child of Janak, rise and be"
51701,BOOK VI.(895),The queen of all my queens and me.
51702,BOOK VI.(895),"Incline thine ear, and I will tell,"
51703,BOOK VI.(895),"Dear lady, how thy husband fell."
51704,BOOK VI.(895),He bridged his way across the sea
51705,BOOK VI.(895),With countless troops to fight with me.
51706,BOOK VI.(895),The setting sun had flushed the west
51707,BOOK VI.(895),When on the shore they took their rest.
51708,BOOK VI.(895),"Weary with toil no watch they kept,"
51709,BOOK VI.(895),Securely on the sands they slept.
51710,BOOK VI.(895),"Prahasta's troops assailed our foes,"
51711,BOOK VI.(895),And smote them in their deep repose.
51712,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce could their bravest prove their might:
51713,BOOK VI.(895),They perished in the dark of night.
51714,BOOK VI.(895),"Axe, spear, and sword, directed well,"
51715,BOOK VI.(895),Upon the sleeping myriads fell.
51716,BOOK VI.(895),First in the fight Prahasta's sword
51717,BOOK VI.(895),Reft of his head thy slumbering lord.
51718,BOOK VI.(895),"Roused at the din Vibhishan rose,"
51719,BOOK VI.(895),"The captive of surrounding foes,"
51720,BOOK VI.(895),And Lakshman through the woods that spread
51721,BOOK VI.(895),Around him with his Vánars fled.
51722,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán fell: one deadly stroke
51723,BOOK VI.(895),"The neck of King Sugríva broke,"
51724,BOOK VI.(895),"And Mainda sank, and Dwivid lay"
51725,BOOK VI.(895),Gasping in blood his life away.
51726,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánars died, or fled dispersed"
51727,BOOK VI.(895),Like cloudlets when the storm has burst.
51728,BOOK VI.(895),"Some rose aloft in air, and more"
51729,BOOK VI.(895),Ran to the sea and filled the shore.
51730,BOOK VI.(895),"On shore, in woods, on hill and plain"
51731,BOOK VI.(895),Our conquering giants left the slain.
51732,BOOK VI.(895),Thus my victorious host o'erthrew

51752,BOOK VI.(895),With fame of this by Ráma strung
51753,BOOK VI.(895),The earth and heaven and hell have rung.

51987,BOOK VI.(895),
51988,BOOK VI.(895),
51989,BOOK VI.(895),Thus Saramá her story told:
51990,BOOK VI.(895),"And Sítá's spirit was consoled,"
51991,BOOK VI.(895),As when the first fresh rain is shed
51992,BOOK VI.(895),The parching earth is comforted.
51993,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, filled with zeal for Sítá's sake,"
51994,BOOK VI.(895),"Again in gentle tones she spake,"
51995,BOOK VI.(895),"And, skilled in arts that soothe and please,"
51996,BOOK VI.(895),Addressed the queen in words like these:
51997,BOOK VI.(895),"""Thy husband, lady, will I seek,"
51998,BOOK VI.(895),"Say the fond words thy lips would speak,"
51999,BOOK VI.(895),"And then, unseen of any eye,"
52000,BOOK VI.(895),Back to thy side will swiftly fly.
52001,BOOK VI.(895),My airy flights are speedier far
52002,BOOK VI.(895),"Than Garuda's and the tempest are."""
52003,BOOK VI.(895),
52004,BOOK VI.(895),Then Sítá spake: her former woe
52005,BOOK VI.(895),Still left her accents faint and low:
52006,BOOK VI.(895),"""I know thy steps, which naught can stay,"
52007,BOOK VI.(895),Can urge through heaven and hell their way.
52008,BOOK VI.(895),Then if thy love and changeless will
52009,BOOK VI.(895),"Would serve the helpless captive still,"
52010,BOOK VI.(895),Go forth and learn each plot and guile
52011,BOOK VI.(895),Planned by the lord of Lanká's isle.
52012,BOOK VI.(895),With magic art like maddening wine
52013,BOOK VI.(895),"He cheats these weeping eyes of mine,"
52014,BOOK VI.(895),"Torments me with his suit, nor spares"
52015,BOOK VI.(895),"Reproof or flattery, threats or prayers."
52016,BOOK VI.(895),These guards surround me night and day;
52017,BOOK VI.(895),"My heart is sad, my senses stray;"
52018,BOOK VI.(895),And helpless in my woe I fear
52019,BOOK VI.(895),"The tyrant Rávan even here."""

52029,BOOK VI.(895),"Then swiftly, to her promise true,"
52030,BOOK VI.(895),Back to the Asoka grove she flew.
52031,BOOK VI.(895),"The lady on the grassy ground,"
52032,BOOK VI.(895),"Longing for her return, she found;"
52033,BOOK VI.(895),"Who with a gentle smile, to greet"

52035,BOOK VI.(895),Through her worn frame a shiver ran
52036,BOOK VI.(895),As Saramá her tale began:
52037,BOOK VI.(895),"""There stood the royal mother: she"
52038,BOOK VI.(895),"Besought her son to set thee free,"
52039,BOOK VI.(895),"And to her counsel, tears and prayers,"

52051,BOOK VI.(895),"As clings the miser to his gold,"
52052,BOOK VI.(895),He would not loose thee from his hold.
52053,BOOK VI.(895),"No, never till in death he lies,"
52054,BOOK VI.(895),Will Lanká's lord release his prize.
52055,BOOK VI.(895),Soon slain by Ráma's arrows all

52058,BOOK VI.(895),"His black-eyed queen from bondage freed."""
52059,BOOK VI.(895),
52060,BOOK VI.(895),An awful sound that moment rose

52062,BOOK VI.(895),Where drum and shell in mingled peal
52063,BOOK VI.(895),Made earth in terror rock and reel.

52065,BOOK VI.(895),"Stood trembling, in their hearts dismayed;"

52076,BOOK VI.(895),Upon the ear of Rávan fell.
52077,BOOK VI.(895),"One moment quailed his haughty look,"
52078,BOOK VI.(895),"One moment in his fear he shook,"
52079,BOOK VI.(895),"But soon recalling wonted pride,"

52081,BOOK VI.(895),And with a voice that thundered through

52083,BOOK VI.(895),"""Lords, I have heard--your tongues have told--"
52084,BOOK VI.(895),How Raghu's son is fierce and bold.
52085,BOOK VI.(895),To Lanká's shore has bridged his way
52086,BOOK VI.(895),And hither leads his wild array.
52087,BOOK VI.(895),"I know your might, in battle tried,"

52094,BOOK VI.(895),"Malyaván, sage and faithful guide."
52095,BOOK VI.(895),Thus to the monarch's speech replied:
52096,BOOK VI.(895),"""Long reigns the king in safe repose,"
52097,BOOK VI.(895),"Unmoved by fear of vanquished foes,"
52098,BOOK VI.(895),Whose feet by saving knowledge led

52101,BOOK VI.(895),"To order peace, to strike or yield:"
52102,BOOK VI.(895),"Prefers, when foes are stronger, peace,"
52103,BOOK VI.(895),And bids a doubtful conflict cease.

52122,BOOK VI.(895),"But they, who check each vain desire,"

52352,BOOK VI.(895),With spirits burning for the fight
52353,BOOK VI.(895),"They saw the giants from the height,"
52354,BOOK VI.(895),And from a hundred throats rang out

52367,BOOK VI.(895),They slept secure: the sun arose
52368,BOOK VI.(895),And called the chieftains from repose.
52369,BOOK VI.(895),"Before the wondering Vánars, gay"
52370,BOOK VI.(895),"With grove and garden, Lanká lay,"
52371,BOOK VI.(895),"Where golden buds the Champak showed,"
52372,BOOK VI.(895),"And bright with bloom Asoka glowed,"
52373,BOOK VI.(895),And palm and Sál and many a tree
52374,BOOK VI.(895),With leaf and flower were fair to see.
52375,BOOK VI.(895),"They looked on wood and lawn and glade,"
52376,BOOK VI.(895),"On emerald grass and dusky shade,"
52377,BOOK VI.(895),"Where creepers filled the air with scent,"

52381,BOOK VI.(895),The wondering Vánars passed the bound
52382,BOOK VI.(895),"That circled that enchanting ground,"
52383,BOOK VI.(895),And as they came a sweet breeze through
52384,BOOK VI.(895),The odorous alleys softly blew.
52385,BOOK VI.(895),"Some Vánars, at their king's behest,"
52386,BOOK VI.(895),"Onward to bannered Lanká pressed,"

52391,BOOK VI.(895),Bright rose before their wondering eyes
52392,BOOK VI.(895),"Trikúta's peak that kissed the skies,"
52393,BOOK VI.(895),"And, clothed with flowers of every hue,"
52394,BOOK VI.(895),Afar its golden radiance threw.
52395,BOOK VI.(895),Most fair to see the mountain's head
52396,BOOK VI.(895),A hundred leagues in length was spread.
52397,BOOK VI.(895),"There Rávan's town, securely placed,"
52398,BOOK VI.(895),The summit of Trikúta graced.
52399,BOOK VI.(895),"O'er leagues of land she stretched in pride,"
52400,BOOK VI.(895),A hundred long and twenty wide.
52401,BOOK VI.(895),They saw a lofty wall enfold
52402,BOOK VI.(895),"The city, built of blocks of gold,"
52403,BOOK VI.(895),They saw the beams of morning fall
52404,BOOK VI.(895),"On dome and fane within the wall,"
52405,BOOK VI.(895),Bright with the shine that mansion gives
52406,BOOK VI.(895),Where Vishnu in his glory lives.
52407,BOOK VI.(895),White-crested like the Lord of Snows
52408,BOOK VI.(895),Before them Rávan's palace rose.
52409,BOOK VI.(895),High on a thousand pillars raised

52421,BOOK VI.(895),"Suvela's peak rose high in air,"
52422,BOOK VI.(895),And with Sugríva turned his eye
52423,BOOK VI.(895),To scan each quarter of the sky.
52424,BOOK VI.(895),"There on Trikúta, nobly planned"
52425,BOOK VI.(895),"And built by Visvakarmá's hand,"
52426,BOOK VI.(895),"He saw the lovely Lanká, dressed"
52427,BOOK VI.(895),"In all her varied beauty, rest."
52428,BOOK VI.(895),High on a tower above the gate
52429,BOOK VI.(895),The tyrant stood in kingly state.
52430,BOOK VI.(895),The royal canopy displayed
52431,BOOK VI.(895),"Above him lent its grateful shade,"
52432,BOOK VI.(895),"And servants, from the giant band,"
52433,BOOK VI.(895),His cheek with jewelled chowries fanned.
52434,BOOK VI.(895),"Red sandal o'er his breast was spread,"
52435,BOOK VI.(895),His ornaments and robe were red:
52436,BOOK VI.(895),Thus shows a cloud of darksome hue
52437,BOOK VI.(895),With golden sunbeams flashing through.
52438,BOOK VI.(895),While Ráma and the chiefs intent
52439,BOOK VI.(895),"Upon the king their glances bent,"
52440,BOOK VI.(895),Up sprang Sugríva from the ground
52441,BOOK VI.(895),And reached the turret at a bound.
52442,BOOK VI.(895),"Unterrified the Vánar stood,"
52443,BOOK VI.(895),"And wroth, with wondrous hardihood,"
52444,BOOK VI.(895),"The king in bitter words addressed,"
52445,BOOK VI.(895),And thus his scorn and hate expressed:
52446,BOOK VI.(895),
52447,BOOK VI.(895),"""King of the giant race, in me"
52448,BOOK VI.(895),The friend and slave of Ráma see.
52449,BOOK VI.(895),"Lord of the world, he gives me power"
52450,BOOK VI.(895),"To smite thee in thy fenced tower."""
52451,BOOK VI.(895),"While through the air his challenge rang,"
52452,BOOK VI.(895),At Rávan's face the Vánar sprang.
52453,BOOK VI.(895),Snatched from his head the kingly crown
52454,BOOK VI.(895),And dashed it in his fury down.
52455,BOOK VI.(895),"Straight at his foe the giant flew,"
52456,BOOK VI.(895),His mighty arms about him threw.
52457,BOOK VI.(895),With strength resistless swung him round
52458,BOOK VI.(895),And dashed him panting to the ground.
52459,BOOK VI.(895),Unharmed amid the storm of blows
52460,BOOK VI.(895),Swift to his feet Sugríva rose.
52461,BOOK VI.(895),Again in furious fight they met:
52462,BOOK VI.(895),"With streams of blood their limbs were wet,"
52463,BOOK VI.(895),Each grasping his opponent's waist.
52464,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus with their branches interlaced,"
52465,BOOK VI.(895),"Which, crimson with the flowers of spring,"
52466,BOOK VI.(895),"From side to side the breezes swing,"
52467,BOOK VI.(895),In furious wrestle you may see
52468,BOOK VI.(895),The Kinsuk and the Seemal tree.(948)
52469,BOOK VI.(895),"They fought with fists and hands, alike"
52470,BOOK VI.(895),Prepared to parry and to strike.
52471,BOOK VI.(895),"Long time the doubtful combat, waged"
52472,BOOK VI.(895),"With matchless strength and fury, raged."
52473,BOOK VI.(895),"Each fiercely struck, each guarded well,"
52474,BOOK VI.(895),"Till, closing, from the tower they fell,"
52475,BOOK VI.(895),"And, grasping each the other's throat,"
52476,BOOK VI.(895),Lay for an instant in the moat.
52477,BOOK VI.(895),"They rose, and each in fiercer mood"
52478,BOOK VI.(895),The sanguinary strife renewed.
52479,BOOK VI.(895),Well matched in size and strength and skill
52480,BOOK VI.(895),They fought the dubious battle still.
52481,BOOK VI.(895),While sweat and blood their limbs bedewed
52482,BOOK VI.(895),"They met, retreated, and pursued:"
52483,BOOK VI.(895),"Each stratagem and art they tried,"
52484,BOOK VI.(895),Stood front to front and swerved aside.
52485,BOOK VI.(895),His hand a while the giant stayed
52486,BOOK VI.(895),And called his magic to his aid.
52487,BOOK VI.(895),"But brave Sugríva, swift to know"
52488,BOOK VI.(895),"The guileful purpose of the foe,"
52489,BOOK VI.(895),"Gained with light leap the upper air,"
52490,BOOK VI.(895),And breath and strength and spirit there;

52505,BOOK VI.(895),Bring not their lives in peril thus;

52527,BOOK VI.(895),Each fiery eye to Lanká turned.
52528,BOOK VI.(895),"On, where the royal brothers led"
52529,BOOK VI.(895),To Lanká's walls the legions sped.

52531,BOOK VI.(895),"Swarmed round their monarch, Ráma chose"
52532,BOOK VI.(895),Where he in person might direct
52533,BOOK VI.(895),"The battle, and his troops protect."

52542,BOOK VI.(895),"The southern gate was Angad's care,"

52544,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán by the port that faced
52545,BOOK VI.(895),"The setting sun his legions placed,"
52546,BOOK VI.(895),And King Sugríva held the wood
52547,BOOK VI.(895),East of the gate where Rávan stood.
52548,BOOK VI.(895),"On every side the myriads met,"
52549,BOOK VI.(895),And Lanká's walls of close beset
52550,BOOK VI.(895),That scarce the roving gale could win

52576,BOOK VI.(895),"Now show the might, employ the guile,"
52577,BOOK VI.(895),"O Monarch of the giants' isle,"

52593,BOOK VI.(895),And lighted from his airy road
52594,BOOK VI.(895),Within the Rákshas king's abode.
52595,BOOK VI.(895),"There sate, the centre of a ring"
52596,BOOK VI.(895),"Of counsellors, the giant king."
52597,BOOK VI.(895),"Swift through the circle Angad pressed,"
52598,BOOK VI.(895),And spoke with fury in his breast:

52620,BOOK VI.(895),"Four of his band their lord obeyed,"
52621,BOOK VI.(895),And eager hands on Angad laid.
52622,BOOK VI.(895),He purposing his strength to show
52623,BOOK VI.(895),"Gave no resistance to the foe,"
52624,BOOK VI.(895),But swiftly round his captors cast
52625,BOOK VI.(895),His mighty arms and held them fast.
52626,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce shout and cry around him rang:
52627,BOOK VI.(895),"Light to the palace roof he sprang,"
52628,BOOK VI.(895),"There his detaining arms unwound,"
52629,BOOK VI.(895),And hurled the giants to the ground.
52630,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, smiting with a fearful stroke,"
52631,BOOK VI.(895),"A turret from the roof he broke,--"
52632,BOOK VI.(895),As when the fiery levin sent

52635,BOOK VI.(895),And flung the stony mass below.
52636,BOOK VI.(895),Again with loud terrific cry
52637,BOOK VI.(895),"He sprang exulting to the sky,"
52638,BOOK VI.(895),"And, joyous for his errand done,"

52660,BOOK VI.(895),My darling with the fawn-like eyes.
52661,BOOK VI.(895),There on the cold bare ground she keeps
52662,BOOK VI.(895),"Sad vigil and for Ráma weeps."""
52663,BOOK VI.(895),"Mad with the thought, ""Charge, charge,"" he cried."
52664,BOOK VI.(895),"""Let earth with Rákshas blood be dyed."""
52665,BOOK VI.(895),
52666,BOOK VI.(895),Responsive to his call rang out
52667,BOOK VI.(895),"A loud, a universal shout,"
52668,BOOK VI.(895),"As myriads filled the moat with stone,"
52669,BOOK VI.(895),"Trees, rocks, and mountains overthrown,"
52670,BOOK VI.(895),And charging at their leader's call
52671,BOOK VI.(895),Pressed forward furious to the wall.
52672,BOOK VI.(895),Some in their headlong ardour scaled
52673,BOOK VI.(895),"The rampart's height, the guard assailed,"
52674,BOOK VI.(895),And many a ponderous fragment rent
52675,BOOK VI.(895),"From portal, tower, and battlement."
52676,BOOK VI.(895),Huge gates adorned with burnished gold
52677,BOOK VI.(895),Were loosed and lifted from their hold;
52678,BOOK VI.(895),"And post and pillar, with a sound"
52679,BOOK VI.(895),"Like thunder, fell upon the ground."
52680,BOOK VI.(895),"At every portal, east and west"
52681,BOOK VI.(895),"And north and south, the chieftains pressed"
52682,BOOK VI.(895),Each in his post appointed led
52683,BOOK VI.(895),His myriads in the forest bred.
52684,BOOK VI.(895),
52685,BOOK VI.(895),"""Charge, let the gates be opened wide:"
52686,BOOK VI.(895),"Charge, charge, my giants,"" Rávan cried."
52687,BOOK VI.(895),"They heard his voice, and loud and long"
52688,BOOK VI.(895),"Rang the wild clamour of the throng,"
52689,BOOK VI.(895),"And shell and drum their notes upsent,"
52690,BOOK VI.(895),And every martial instrument.
52691,BOOK VI.(895),"Forth, at the bidding of their lord"
52692,BOOK VI.(895),"From every gate the giants poured,"
52693,BOOK VI.(895),"As, when the waters rise and swell,"
52694,BOOK VI.(895),Huge waves preceding waves impel.
52695,BOOK VI.(895),Again from every Vánar throat
52696,BOOK VI.(895),A scream of fierce defiance smote
52697,BOOK VI.(895),The welkin: earth and sea and sky
52698,BOOK VI.(895),Reëchoed with the awful cry.
52699,BOOK VI.(895),"The roar of elephants, the neigh"
52700,BOOK VI.(895),Of horses eager for the fray.
52701,BOOK VI.(895),"The frequent clash of warriors' steel,"
52702,BOOK VI.(895),The rattling of the chariot wheel.
52703,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce was the deadly fight: opposed
52704,BOOK VI.(895),"In terrible array they closed,"
52705,BOOK VI.(895),As when the Gods of heaven enraged
52706,BOOK VI.(895),With rebel fiends wild battle waged.
52707,BOOK VI.(895),"Axe, spear, and mace were wielded well:"
52708,BOOK VI.(895),At every blow a Vánar fell.
52709,BOOK VI.(895),But shivered rock and brandished tree
52710,BOOK VI.(895),"Brought many a giant on his knee,"
52711,BOOK VI.(895),To perish in his turn beneath
52712,BOOK VI.(895),The deadly wounds of nails and teeth.
52713,BOOK VI.(895),
52714,BOOK VI.(895),
52715,BOOK VI.(895),

52718,BOOK VI.(895),
52719,BOOK VI.(895),
52720,BOOK VI.(895),Brave chiefs of each opposing side
52721,BOOK VI.(895),Their strength in single combat tried.
52722,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce Indrajít the fight began
52723,BOOK VI.(895),With Angad in the battle's van.
52724,BOOK VI.(895),"Sampáti, strongest of his race,"
52725,BOOK VI.(895),Stood with Prajangha face to face.
52726,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán, Jambumáli met"
52727,BOOK VI.(895),In mortal opposition set.
52728,BOOK VI.(895),"Vibhishan, brother of the lord"
52729,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Lanká, raised his threatening sword"
52730,BOOK VI.(895),"And singled out, with eyes aglow"
52731,BOOK VI.(895),"With wrath, Satrughna for his foe."
52732,BOOK VI.(895),"The mighty Gaja Tapan sought,"
52733,BOOK VI.(895),And Níla with Nikumbha fought.
52734,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva, Vánar king, defied"
52735,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce Praghas long in battle tried,"
52736,BOOK VI.(895),And Lakshman fearless in the fight
52737,BOOK VI.(895),Encountered Vírúpáksha's might.
52738,BOOK VI.(895),To meet the royal Ráma came
52739,BOOK VI.(895),Wild Agniketu fierce as flame;
52740,BOOK VI.(895),"Mitraghana, he who loved to strike"
52741,BOOK VI.(895),His foeman and his friend alike:
52742,BOOK VI.(895),"With Rasmiketu, known and feared"
52743,BOOK VI.(895),Where'er his ponderous flag was reared;
52744,BOOK VI.(895),And Yajnakopa whose delight
52745,BOOK VI.(895),Was ruin of the sacred rite.
52746,BOOK VI.(895),"These met and fought, with thousands more,"
52747,BOOK VI.(895),And trampled earth was red with gore.
52748,BOOK VI.(895),Swift as the bolt which Indra sends
52749,BOOK VI.(895),When fire from heaven the mountain rends
52750,BOOK VI.(895),Smote Indrajít with furious blows
52751,BOOK VI.(895),On Angad queller of his foes.
52752,BOOK VI.(895),But Angad from his foeman tore
52753,BOOK VI.(895),"The murderous mace the warrior bore,"
52754,BOOK VI.(895),"And low in dust his coursers rolled,"
52755,BOOK VI.(895),"His driver, and his car of gold."
52756,BOOK VI.(895),"Struck by the shafts Prajangha sped,"
52757,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánar chief Sampáti bled,"
52758,BOOK VI.(895),"But, heedless of his gashes he"
52759,BOOK VI.(895),Crushed down the giant with a tree.
52760,BOOK VI.(895),Then car-borne Jambumáli smote
52761,BOOK VI.(895),Hanumán on the chest and throat;
52762,BOOK VI.(895),"But at the car the Vánar rushed,"
52763,BOOK VI.(895),"And chariot, steeds, and rider crushed."
52764,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva whirled a huge tree round,"
52765,BOOK VI.(895),And struck fierce Praghas to the ground.
52766,BOOK VI.(895),One arrow shot from Lakshman's bow
52767,BOOK VI.(895),Laid mighty Vírúpáksha low.
52768,BOOK VI.(895),His giant foes round Ráma pressed
52769,BOOK VI.(895),And shot their shafts at head and breast;
52770,BOOK VI.(895),"But, when the iron shower was spent,"
52771,BOOK VI.(895),"Four arrows from his bow he sent,"
52772,BOOK VI.(895),"And every missile, deftly sped;"
52773,BOOK VI.(895),Cleft from the trunk a giant head.(951)

52779,BOOK VI.(895),
52780,BOOK VI.(895),
52781,BOOK VI.(895),The lord of Light had sunk and set:
52782,BOOK VI.(895),Night came; the foeman struggled yet;
52783,BOOK VI.(895),And fiercer for the gloom of night
52784,BOOK VI.(895),Grew the wild fury of the fight.
52785,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce could each warrior's eager eye
52786,BOOK VI.(895),The foeman from the friend descry.
52787,BOOK VI.(895),"""Rákshas or Vánar? say;"" cried each,"
52788,BOOK VI.(895),And foe knew foeman by his speech.
52789,BOOK VI.(895),"""Why wilt thou fly? O warrior, stay:"
52790,BOOK VI.(895),"Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:"""
52791,BOOK VI.(895),"Such were the cries, such words of fear"
52792,BOOK VI.(895),Smote through the gloom each listening ear.
52793,BOOK VI.(895),Each swarthy rover of the night
52794,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose golden armour flashed with light,"
52795,BOOK VI.(895),Showed like a towering hill embraced
52796,BOOK VI.(895),By burning woods about his waist.
52797,BOOK VI.(895),"The giants at the Vánars flew,"
52798,BOOK VI.(895),And ravening ate the foes they slew:
52799,BOOK VI.(895),"With mortal bite like serpent's fang,"
52800,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánars at the giants sprang,"
52801,BOOK VI.(895),And car and steeds and they who bore
52802,BOOK VI.(895),The pennons fell bedewed with gore.
52803,BOOK VI.(895),"No serried band, no firm array"
52804,BOOK VI.(895),The fury of their charge could stay.
52805,BOOK VI.(895),"Down went the horse and rider, down"
52806,BOOK VI.(895),Went giant lords of high renown.
52807,BOOK VI.(895),"Though midnight's shade was dense and dark,"
52808,BOOK VI.(895),With skill that swerved not from the mark
52809,BOOK VI.(895),"Their bows the sons of Raghu drew,"
52810,BOOK VI.(895),And each keen shaft a chieftain slew.
52811,BOOK VI.(895),Uprose the blinding dust from meads
52812,BOOK VI.(895),"Ploughed by the cars and trampling steeds,"
52813,BOOK VI.(895),And where the warriors fell the flood
52814,BOOK VI.(895),Was dark and terrible with blood.
52815,BOOK VI.(895),"Six giants(952) singled Ráma out,"
52816,BOOK VI.(895),And charged him with a furious shout
52817,BOOK VI.(895),Loud as the roaring of the sea
52818,BOOK VI.(895),When every wind is raging free.
52819,BOOK VI.(895),Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;
52820,BOOK VI.(895),Six giants dead on earth were left.
52821,BOOK VI.(895),"Nor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,"
52822,BOOK VI.(895),And from the sounding weapon rained
52823,BOOK VI.(895),A storm of shafts whose fiery glare
52824,BOOK VI.(895),Filled all the region of the air;
52825,BOOK VI.(895),And chieftains dropped before his aim
52826,BOOK VI.(895),Like moths that perish in the flame.
52827,BOOK VI.(895),"Earth glistened where the arrows fell,"
52828,BOOK VI.(895),As shines in autumn nights a dell
52829,BOOK VI.(895),"Which fireflies, flashing through the gloom,"
52830,BOOK VI.(895),With momentary light illume.
52831,BOOK VI.(895),
52832,BOOK VI.(895),"But Indrajít, when Báli's son(953)"
52833,BOOK VI.(895),"The victory o'er the foe had won,"
52834,BOOK VI.(895),Saw with a fury-kindled eye
52835,BOOK VI.(895),His mangled steeds and driver die;
52836,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, lost in air, he fled the fight,"
52837,BOOK VI.(895),And vanished from the victor's sight.
52838,BOOK VI.(895),"The Gods and saints glad voices raised,"
52839,BOOK VI.(895),And Angad for his virtue praised;
52840,BOOK VI.(895),And Raghu's sons bestowed the meed
52841,BOOK VI.(895),Of honour due to valorous deed.
52842,BOOK VI.(895),
52843,BOOK VI.(895),"Compelled his shattered car to quit,"
52844,BOOK VI.(895),"Rage filled the soul of Indrajít,"
52845,BOOK VI.(895),"Who brooked not, strong by Brahmá's grace"
52846,BOOK VI.(895),Defeat from one of Vánar race.
52847,BOOK VI.(895),In magic mist concealed from view
52848,BOOK VI.(895),"His bow the treacherous warrior drew,"
52849,BOOK VI.(895),And Raghu's sons were first to feel
52850,BOOK VI.(895),The tempest of his winged steel.
52851,BOOK VI.(895),Then when his arrows failed to kill
52852,BOOK VI.(895),"The princes who defied him still,"
52853,BOOK VI.(895),"He bound them with the serpent noose,(954)"
52854,BOOK VI.(895),The magic bond which none might loose.

52860,BOOK VI.(895),
52861,BOOK VI.(895),
52862,BOOK VI.(895),"Brave Ráma, burning still to know"
52863,BOOK VI.(895),"The station of his artful foe,"
52864,BOOK VI.(895),"Gave to ten chieftains, mid the best"
52865,BOOK VI.(895),"Of all the host, his high behest."
52866,BOOK VI.(895),Swift rose in air the Vánar band:
52867,BOOK VI.(895),Each region of the sky they scanned:
52868,BOOK VI.(895),But Rávan's son by magic skill
52869,BOOK VI.(895),"Checked them with arrows swifter still,"
52870,BOOK VI.(895),When streams of blood from chest and side
52871,BOOK VI.(895),"The dauntless Vánars' limbs had dyed,"
52872,BOOK VI.(895),The giant in his misty shroud
52873,BOOK VI.(895),Showed like the sun obscured by cloud.
52874,BOOK VI.(895),"Like serpents hissing through the air,"
52875,BOOK VI.(895),His arrows smote the princely pair;
52876,BOOK VI.(895),And from their limbs at every rent
52877,BOOK VI.(895),A stream of rushing blood was sent.
52878,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Kinsuk trees they stood, that show"
52879,BOOK VI.(895),In spring their blossoms' crimson glow.
52880,BOOK VI.(895),Then Indrajít with fury eyed
52881,BOOK VI.(895),"Ikshváku's royal sons, and cried:"
52882,BOOK VI.(895),
52883,BOOK VI.(895),"""Not mighty Indra can assail"
52884,BOOK VI.(895),Or see me when I choose to veil
52885,BOOK VI.(895),"My form in battle: and can ye,"
52886,BOOK VI.(895),"Children of earth, contend with me?"
52887,BOOK VI.(895),The arrowy noose this hand has shot
52888,BOOK VI.(895),Has bound you with a hopeless knot;
52889,BOOK VI.(895),"And, slaughtered by my shafts and bow,"
52890,BOOK VI.(895),"To Yáma's hall this hour ye go."""
52891,BOOK VI.(895),
52892,BOOK VI.(895),"He spoke, and shouted. Then anew"
52893,BOOK VI.(895),"The arrows from his bowstring flew,"
52894,BOOK VI.(895),"And pierced, well aimed with perfect art,"
52895,BOOK VI.(895),Each limb and joint and vital part.
52896,BOOK VI.(895),"Transfixed with shafts in every limb,"
52897,BOOK VI.(895),"Their strength relaxed, their eyes grew dim."
52898,BOOK VI.(895),"As two tall standards side by side,"
52899,BOOK VI.(895),"With each sustaining rope untied,"
52900,BOOK VI.(895),"Fall levelled by the howling blast,"
52901,BOOK VI.(895),So earth's majestic lords at last
52902,BOOK VI.(895),"Beneath the arrowy tempest reeled,"
52903,BOOK VI.(895),And prostrate pressed the battle field.
52904,BOOK VI.(895),

52906,BOOK VI.(895),
52907,BOOK VI.(895),
52908,BOOK VI.(895),Canto XLVI. Indrajít's Triumph.
52909,BOOK VI.(895),
52910,BOOK VI.(895),
52911,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar chiefs whose piercing eyes
52912,BOOK VI.(895),"Scanned eagerly the earth and skies,"
52913,BOOK VI.(895),Saw the brave brothers wounded sore
52914,BOOK VI.(895),Transfixed with darts and stained with gore.
52915,BOOK VI.(895),"The monarch of the Vánar race,"
52916,BOOK VI.(895),"With wise Vibhishan, reached the place;"
52917,BOOK VI.(895),"Angad and Níla came behind,"
52918,BOOK VI.(895),"And others of the forest kind,"
52919,BOOK VI.(895),And standing with Hanúmán there
52920,BOOK VI.(895),Lamented for the fallen pair.
52921,BOOK VI.(895),Their melancholy eyes they raised;
52922,BOOK VI.(895),In fruitless search a while they gazed.
52923,BOOK VI.(895),But magic arts Vibhishan knew;
52924,BOOK VI.(895),"Not hidden from his keener view,"
52925,BOOK VI.(895),"Though veiled by magic from the rest,"
52926,BOOK VI.(895),The son of Rávan stood confessed.
52927,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce Indrajít with savage pride
52928,BOOK VI.(895),"The fallen sons of Raghu eyed,"
52929,BOOK VI.(895),And every giant heart was proud
52930,BOOK VI.(895),As thus the warrior cried aloud:
52931,BOOK VI.(895),
52932,BOOK VI.(895),"""Slain by mine arrows Ráma lies,"
52933,BOOK VI.(895),And closed in death are Lakshman's eyes.
52934,BOOK VI.(895),Dead are the mighty princes who
52935,BOOK VI.(895),Dúshan and Khara smote and slew.
52936,BOOK VI.(895),The Gods and fiends may toil in vain
52937,BOOK VI.(895),To free them from the binding chain.
52938,BOOK VI.(895),"The haughty chief, my father's dread,"
52939,BOOK VI.(895),"Who drove him sleepless from his bed,"
52940,BOOK VI.(895),"While Lanká, troubled like a brook"
52941,BOOK VI.(895),"In rain time, heard his name and shook:"
52942,BOOK VI.(895),He whose fierce hate our lives pursued
52943,BOOK VI.(895),Lies helpless by my shafts subdued.
52944,BOOK VI.(895),Now fruitless is each wondrous deed
52945,BOOK VI.(895),"Wrought by the race the forests breed,"
52946,BOOK VI.(895),And fruitless every toil at last
52947,BOOK VI.(895),"Like cloudlets when the rains are past."""
52948,BOOK VI.(895),Then rose the shout of giants loud
52949,BOOK VI.(895),"As thunder from a bursting cloud,"
52950,BOOK VI.(895),"When, deeming Ráma, dead, they raised"
52951,BOOK VI.(895),Their voices and the conqueror praised.
52952,BOOK VI.(895),
52953,BOOK VI.(895),"Still motionless, as lie the slain,"
52954,BOOK VI.(895),"The brothers pressed the bloody plain,"
52955,BOOK VI.(895),"No sigh they drew, no breath they heaved,"
52956,BOOK VI.(895),And lay as though of life bereaved.
52957,BOOK VI.(895),"Proud of the deed his art had done,"
52958,BOOK VI.(895),"To Lanká's town went Rávan's son,"
52959,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, as he passed, all fear was stilled,"
52960,BOOK VI.(895),And every heart with triumph filled.
52961,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva trembled as he viewed
52962,BOOK VI.(895),"Each fallen prince with blood bedewed,"
52963,BOOK VI.(895),And in his eyes which overflowed
52964,BOOK VI.(895),With tears the flame of anger glowed.
52965,BOOK VI.(895),"""Calm,"" cried Vibhishan, ""calm thy fears,"
52966,BOOK VI.(895),And stay the torrent of thy tears.
52967,BOOK VI.(895),"Still must the chance of battle change,"
52968,BOOK VI.(895),And victory still delight to range.
52969,BOOK VI.(895),Our cause again will she befriend
52970,BOOK VI.(895),And bring us triumph in the end.
52971,BOOK VI.(895),This is not death: each prince will break
52972,BOOK VI.(895),"The spell that holds him, and awake;"
52973,BOOK VI.(895),Nor long shall numbing magic bind
52974,BOOK VI.(895),"The mighty arm, the lofty mind."""
52975,BOOK VI.(895),
52976,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: his finger bathed in dew
52977,BOOK VI.(895),Across Sugríva's eyes he drew;
52978,BOOK VI.(895),"From dulling mist his vision freed,"
52979,BOOK VI.(895),And spoke these words to suit the need:
52980,BOOK VI.(895),"""No time is this for fear: away"
52981,BOOK VI.(895),With fainting heart and weak delay.
52982,BOOK VI.(895),"Now, e'en the tear which sorrow wrings"
52983,BOOK VI.(895),From loving eyes destruction brings.
52984,BOOK VI.(895),"Up, on to battle at the head"
52985,BOOK VI.(895),Of those brave troops which Ráma led.
52986,BOOK VI.(895),Or guardian by his side remain
52987,BOOK VI.(895),Till sense and strength the prince regain.
52988,BOOK VI.(895),"Soon shall the trance-bound pair revive,"
52989,BOOK VI.(895),And from our hearts all sorrow drive.
52990,BOOK VI.(895),"Though prostrate on the earth he lie,"
52991,BOOK VI.(895),Deem not that Ráma's death is nigh;
52992,BOOK VI.(895),Deem not that Lakshmí will forget
52993,BOOK VI.(895),Or leave her darling champion yet.
52994,BOOK VI.(895),Rest here and be thy heart consoled;
52995,BOOK VI.(895),"Ponder my words, be firm and bold."
52996,BOOK VI.(895),"I, foremost in the battlefield,"
52997,BOOK VI.(895),Will rally all who faint or yield.
52998,BOOK VI.(895),Their staring eyes betray their fear;
52999,BOOK VI.(895),They whisper each in other's ear.
53000,BOOK VI.(895),"They, when they hear my cheering cry"

53064,BOOK VI.(895),Watched by the fallen brothers' side.
53065,BOOK VI.(895),There stretched upon his gory bed
53066,BOOK VI.(895),"Each brother lay as lie the dead,"
53067,BOOK VI.(895),With shattered mail and splintered bow
53068,BOOK VI.(895),Pierced by the arrows of the foe.
53069,BOOK VI.(895),"When on the pair her eyes she bent,"

53279,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánars' headlong flight was stayed.
53280,BOOK VI.(895),A little while Vibhishan eyed
53281,BOOK VI.(895),The brothers fallen side by side.
53282,BOOK VI.(895),His giant fingers wet with dew
53283,BOOK VI.(895),"Across the heroes' eyes he drew,"

53292,BOOK VI.(895),"I on their might for aid relied,"
53293,BOOK VI.(895),And in my cause they fought and died.
53294,BOOK VI.(895),Lost is the hope that soothed each pain:

53368,BOOK VI.(895),"Again their eyes were bright and bold,"

53540,BOOK VI.(895),"And smote Hanúmán on the face,"
53541,BOOK VI.(895),Who maddened by the wound's keen pang
53542,BOOK VI.(895),Again upon his foeman sprang;
53543,BOOK VI.(895),And on the giant's head the rock
53544,BOOK VI.(895),Descended with resistless shock.
53545,BOOK VI.(895),Crushed was each limb: a shapeless mass

53566,BOOK VI.(895),"Cars, camels, steeds were well arrayed,"

53568,BOOK VI.(895),Rings decked his arms: about his waist

53571,BOOK VI.(895),Glittered his cap and coronet.
53572,BOOK VI.(895),Borne on a bannered car that glowed
53573,BOOK VI.(895),"With golden sheen the warrior rode,"
53574,BOOK VI.(895),And footmen marched with spear and sword
53575,BOOK VI.(895),And bow and mace behind their lord.

53585,BOOK VI.(895),Falling before he reached the field.
53586,BOOK VI.(895),"They met in mortal strife engaged,"

53595,BOOK VI.(895),The rocks and trees which Vánars threw.
53596,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce as a hungry lion when
53597,BOOK VI.(895),"Unwary deer approach his den,"

53618,BOOK VI.(895),"Fly to the Lord of Life for aid,"
53619,BOOK VI.(895),To Angad for protection fled

53623,BOOK VI.(895),"A hundred thousand arrows, hot"

53626,BOOK VI.(895),His foeman's body pierced and rent.
53627,BOOK VI.(895),From Angad's limbs ran floods of gore:
53628,BOOK VI.(895),"A stately tree from earth he tore,"
53629,BOOK VI.(895),"Which, maddened as his gashes bled,"
53630,BOOK VI.(895),He hurled at his opponent's head.
53631,BOOK VI.(895),His bow the dauntless giant drew;
53632,BOOK VI.(895),"To meet the tree swift arrows flew,"
53633,BOOK VI.(895),"Checked the huge missile's onward way,"
53634,BOOK VI.(895),And harmless on the earth it lay.
53635,BOOK VI.(895),"A while the Vánar chieftain gazed,"
53636,BOOK VI.(895),Then from the earth a rock he raised
53637,BOOK VI.(895),"Rent from a thunder-splitten height,"
53638,BOOK VI.(895),And cast it with resistless might.
53639,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant marked, and, mace in hand,"
53640,BOOK VI.(895),"Leapt from his chariot to the sand,"
53641,BOOK VI.(895),Ere the rough mass descending broke
53642,BOOK VI.(895),"The seat, the wheel, the pole and yoke."
53643,BOOK VI.(895),
53644,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Angad seized a shattered hill,"

53646,BOOK VI.(895),And with full force the jagged peak
53647,BOOK VI.(895),Fell crashing on the giant's cheek.
53648,BOOK VI.(895),"He staggered, reeled, and fell: the blood"
53649,BOOK VI.(895),Gushed from the giant in a flood.
53650,BOOK VI.(895),"Reft of his might, each sense astray,"
53651,BOOK VI.(895),A while upon the sand he lay.
53652,BOOK VI.(895),But strength and wandering sense returned
53653,BOOK VI.(895),"Again his eyes with fury burned,"
53654,BOOK VI.(895),And with his mace upraised on high
53655,BOOK VI.(895),He wounded Angad on the thigh.
53656,BOOK VI.(895),"Then from his hand his mace he threw,"
53657,BOOK VI.(895),And closer to his foeman drew.
53658,BOOK VI.(895),"Then with their fists they fought, and smote"
53659,BOOK VI.(895),On brow and cheek and chest and throat.
53660,BOOK VI.(895),"Worn out with toil, their limbs bedewed,"
53661,BOOK VI.(895),"With blood, the strife they still renewed,"
53662,BOOK VI.(895),Like Mercury and fiery Mars
53663,BOOK VI.(895),Met in fierce battle mid the stars.
53664,BOOK VI.(895),
53665,BOOK VI.(895),A while the deadly fight was stayed:
53666,BOOK VI.(895),Each armed him with his trusty blade
53667,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose sheath with tinkling bells supplied,"
53668,BOOK VI.(895),"And golden net, adorned his side;"
53669,BOOK VI.(895),And grasped his ponderous leather shield
53670,BOOK VI.(895),To fight till one should fall or yield.
53671,BOOK VI.(895),Unnumbered wounds they gave and took:
53672,BOOK VI.(895),Their wearied bodies reeled and shook.
53673,BOOK VI.(895),At length upon the sand that drank
53674,BOOK VI.(895),"Streams of their blood the warriors sank,"
53675,BOOK VI.(895),But as a serpent rears his head
53676,BOOK VI.(895),"Sore wounded by a peasant's tread,"
53677,BOOK VI.(895),"So Angad, fallen on his knees,"
53678,BOOK VI.(895),Yet gathered strength his sword to seize;

53769,BOOK VI.(895),To guard the city from surprise
53770,BOOK VI.(895),By Ráma's forest born allies.

53772,BOOK VI.(895),"Cleaves swift-advancing billows, he"
53773,BOOK VI.(895),Charged with impetuous onset through

53788,BOOK VI.(895),"Gaváksha, Gavaya heard their call,"
53789,BOOK VI.(895),"And, poising hills, in act to fling"

53792,BOOK VI.(895),"He checked them with his arrowy rain,"
53793,BOOK VI.(895),And every brave assailant felt
53794,BOOK VI.(895),"The piercing wounds his missiles dealt,"
53795,BOOK VI.(895),Then smitten by the shafts that came
53796,BOOK VI.(895),"Keen, fleet, and thick, with certain aim,"
53797,BOOK VI.(895),"They fled to Ráma, sure defence"
53798,BOOK VI.(895),"Against the oppressor's violence,"
53799,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, reverent palm to palm applied,"
53800,BOOK VI.(895),Thus Lakshman to his brother cried:
53801,BOOK VI.(895),"""To me, my lord, the task entrust"
53802,BOOK VI.(895),"To lay this giant in the dust."""
53803,BOOK VI.(895),"""Go, then,"" said Ráma, ""bravely fight;"

53806,BOOK VI.(895),"Fears not the Lord of earth and skies,"
53807,BOOK VI.(895),Keep on thy guard: with keenest eye
53808,BOOK VI.(895),Thy moments of attack espy.

53810,BOOK VI.(895),"Protect thee with the bow and sword."""
53811,BOOK VI.(895),
53812,BOOK VI.(895),Then Lakshman round his brother threw
53813,BOOK VI.(895),"His mighty arms in honour due,"
53814,BOOK VI.(895),"Bent lowly down his reverent head,"
53815,BOOK VI.(895),And onward to the battle sped.
53816,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán from afar beheld
53817,BOOK VI.(895),How Rávan's shafts the Vánars quelled:
53818,BOOK VI.(895),"To meet the giant's car he ran,"
53819,BOOK VI.(895),Raised his right arm and thus began:
53820,BOOK VI.(895),"""If Brahmá's boon thy life has screened"
53821,BOOK VI.(895),"From Yaksha, God, Gandharva, fiend,"
53822,BOOK VI.(895),"With these contending fear no ill,"
53823,BOOK VI.(895),"But tremble at a Vánar still."""
53824,BOOK VI.(895),With fury flashing from his eye
53825,BOOK VI.(895),The lord of Lanká made reply:
53826,BOOK VI.(895),"""Strike, Vánar, strike: the fray begin,"
53827,BOOK VI.(895),And hope eternal fame to win.
53828,BOOK VI.(895),This arm shall prove thee in the strife
53829,BOOK VI.(895),"And end thy glory and thy life."""
53830,BOOK VI.(895),"""Remember,"" cried the Wind-God's son,"
53831,BOOK VI.(895),"""Remember all that I have done,"
53832,BOOK VI.(895),"My prowess, King, thou knowest well,"
53833,BOOK VI.(895),"Shown in the fight when Aksha(963) fell."""
53834,BOOK VI.(895),
53835,BOOK VI.(895),With heavy hand the giant smote
53836,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán on the chest and throat,"
53837,BOOK VI.(895),"Who reeled and staggered to and fro,"
53838,BOOK VI.(895),Stunned for a moment by the blow.
53839,BOOK VI.(895),"Till, mustering strength, his hand he reared"
53840,BOOK VI.(895),And struck the foe whom Indra feared.
53841,BOOK VI.(895),"His huge limbs bent beneath the shock,"
53842,BOOK VI.(895),"As mountains, in an earthquake, rock,"
53843,BOOK VI.(895),And from the Gods and sages pealed
53844,BOOK VI.(895),Shouts of loud triumph as he reeled.
53845,BOOK VI.(895),But strength returning nerved his frame:
53846,BOOK VI.(895),His eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame.
53847,BOOK VI.(895),No living creature might resist
53848,BOOK VI.(895),That blow of his tremendous fist
53849,BOOK VI.(895),Which fell upon Hanúmán's flank:
53850,BOOK VI.(895),"And to the ground the Vánar sank,"
53851,BOOK VI.(895),No sign of life his body showed:
53852,BOOK VI.(895),And Rávan in his chariot rode
53853,BOOK VI.(895),At Níla; and his arrowy rain
53854,BOOK VI.(895),Fell on the captain and his train.
53855,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce Níla stayed his Vánar band,"
53856,BOOK VI.(895),"And, heaving with his single hand"
53857,BOOK VI.(895),"A mountain peak, with vigorous swing"
53858,BOOK VI.(895),Hurled the huge missile at the king.
53859,BOOK VI.(895),
53860,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán life and strength regained,"
53861,BOOK VI.(895),Burned for the fight and thus complained:
53862,BOOK VI.(895),"""Why, coward giant, didst thou flee"
53863,BOOK VI.(895),"And leave the doubtful fight with me?"""
53864,BOOK VI.(895),Seven mighty arrows keen and fleet
53865,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant launched, the hill to meet;"
53866,BOOK VI.(895),"And, all its force and fury stayed,"
53867,BOOK VI.(895),The harmless mass on earth was laid.
53868,BOOK VI.(895),Enraged the Vánar chief beheld
53869,BOOK VI.(895),"The mountain peak by force repelled,"
53870,BOOK VI.(895),And rained upon the foe a shower
53871,BOOK VI.(895),Of trees uptorn with branch and flower.
53872,BOOK VI.(895),Still his keen shafts which pierced and rent
53873,BOOK VI.(895),Each flying tree the giant sent:
53874,BOOK VI.(895),Still was the Vánar doomed to feel
53875,BOOK VI.(895),The tempest of the winged steel.
53876,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, smarting from that arrowy storm,"
53877,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánar chief condensed his form,(964)"
53878,BOOK VI.(895),And lightly leaping from the ground
53879,BOOK VI.(895),On Rávan's standard footing found;
53880,BOOK VI.(895),Then springing unimpeded down
53881,BOOK VI.(895),Stood on his bow and golden crown.
53882,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar's nimble leaps amazed
53883,BOOK VI.(895),Ikshváku's son who stood and gazed.
53884,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant, raging in his heart,"
53885,BOOK VI.(895),Laid on his bow a fiery dart;
53886,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánar on his flagstaff eyed,"
53887,BOOK VI.(895),And thus in tones of fury cried:
53888,BOOK VI.(895),"""Well skilled in magic lore art thou:"
53889,BOOK VI.(895),But will thine art avail thee now?
53890,BOOK VI.(895),See if thy magic will defend
53891,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy life against the dart I send."""
53892,BOOK VI.(895),
53893,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus Rávan spake, the giant king,"
53894,BOOK VI.(895),And loosed the arrow from the string.
53895,BOOK VI.(895),"It pierced, with direst fury sped,"
53896,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar with its flaming head.
53897,BOOK VI.(895),"His father's might, his power innate"
53898,BOOK VI.(895),Preserved him from the threatened fate.
53899,BOOK VI.(895),"Upon his knees he fell, distained"
53900,BOOK VI.(895),"With streams of blood, but life remained."
53901,BOOK VI.(895),
53902,BOOK VI.(895),Still Rávan for the battle burned:
53903,BOOK VI.(895),"At Lakshman next his car he turned,"
53904,BOOK VI.(895),"And charged amain with furious show,"
53905,BOOK VI.(895),Straining in mighty hands his bow.
53906,BOOK VI.(895),"""Come,"" Lakshman cried, ""assay the fight:"
53907,BOOK VI.(895),"Leave foes unworthy of thy might."""
53908,BOOK VI.(895),Thus Lakshman spoke: and Lanká's lord
53909,BOOK VI.(895),Heard the dread thunder of the cord.
53910,BOOK VI.(895),And mad with burning rage and pride
53911,BOOK VI.(895),In hasty words like these replied:
53912,BOOK VI.(895),"""Joy, joy is mine, O Raghu's son:"
53913,BOOK VI.(895),Thy fate to-day thou canst not shun.
53914,BOOK VI.(895),Slain by mine arrows thou shalt tread
53915,BOOK VI.(895),"The gloomy pathway of the dead."""
53916,BOOK VI.(895),
53917,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus as he spoke his bow he drew,"
53918,BOOK VI.(895),"And seven keen shafts at Lakshman flew,"
53919,BOOK VI.(895),But Raghu's son with surest aim
53920,BOOK VI.(895),Cleft every arrow as it came.
53921,BOOK VI.(895),Thus with fleet shafts each warrior shot
53922,BOOK VI.(895),"Against his foe, and rested not."
53923,BOOK VI.(895),"Then one choice weapon from his store,"
53924,BOOK VI.(895),"By Brahmá's self bestowed of yore,"
53925,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce as the flames that end the world,"
53926,BOOK VI.(895),The giant king at Lakshman hurled.
53927,BOOK VI.(895),"The hero fell, and racked with pain,"
53928,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce could his hand his bow retain.
53929,BOOK VI.(895),But sense and strength resumed their seat
53930,BOOK VI.(895),"And, lightly springing to his feet,"
53931,BOOK VI.(895),He struck with one tremendous stroke
53932,BOOK VI.(895),And Rávan's bow in splinters broke.
53933,BOOK VI.(895),From Lakshman's cord three arrows flew
53934,BOOK VI.(895),And pierced the giant monarch through.
53935,BOOK VI.(895),"Sore wounded Rávan closed, and round"
53936,BOOK VI.(895),Ikshváku's son his strong arms wound.
53937,BOOK VI.(895),"With strength unrivalled, Brahmá's gift,"
53938,BOOK VI.(895),He strove from earth his foe to lift.
53939,BOOK VI.(895),"""Shall I,"" he cried, ""who overthrow"
53940,BOOK VI.(895),"Mount Meru and the Lord of Snow,"
53941,BOOK VI.(895),"And heaven and all who dwell therein,"
53942,BOOK VI.(895),"Be foiled by one of Ráma's kin?"""
53943,BOOK VI.(895),"But though he heaved, and toiled, and strained,"
53944,BOOK VI.(895),Unmoved Ikshváku's son remained.
53945,BOOK VI.(895),His frame by those huge arms compressed
53946,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant's God-given force confessed,"
53947,BOOK VI.(895),But conscious that himself was part
53948,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Vishnu, he was firm in heart."
53949,BOOK VI.(895),
53950,BOOK VI.(895),"The Wind-God's son the fight beheld,"
53951,BOOK VI.(895),"And rushed at Rávan, rage-impelled."
53952,BOOK VI.(895),Down crashed his mighty hand; the foe
53953,BOOK VI.(895),Full in the chest received the blow.
53954,BOOK VI.(895),"His eyes grew dim, his knees gave way,"
53955,BOOK VI.(895),And senseless on the earth he lay.
53956,BOOK VI.(895),
53957,BOOK VI.(895),The Wind-God's son to Ráma bore
53958,BOOK VI.(895),Deep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.
53959,BOOK VI.(895),He whom no foe might lift or bend
53960,BOOK VI.(895),Was light as air to such a friend.
53961,BOOK VI.(895),"The dart that Lakshman's side had cleft,"
53962,BOOK VI.(895),"Untouched, the hero's body left,"
53963,BOOK VI.(895),And flashing through the air afar
53964,BOOK VI.(895),Resumed its place in Rávan's car;
53965,BOOK VI.(895),"And, waxing well though wounded sore,"
53966,BOOK VI.(895),He felt the deadly pain no more.
53967,BOOK VI.(895),"And Rávan, though with deep wounds pained,"
53968,BOOK VI.(895),"Slowly his sense and strength regained,"
53969,BOOK VI.(895),And furious still and undismayed
53970,BOOK VI.(895),On bow and shaft his hand he laid.
53971,BOOK VI.(895),
53972,BOOK VI.(895),Then Hanumán to Ráma cried:
53973,BOOK VI.(895),"""Ascend my back, great chief, and ride"
53974,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Vishnu borne on Garud's wing,"
53975,BOOK VI.(895),"To battle with the giant king."""
53976,BOOK VI.(895),"So, burning for the dire attack,"
53977,BOOK VI.(895),"Rode Ráma on the Vánar's back,"
53978,BOOK VI.(895),And with fierce accents loud and slow
53979,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus gave defiance to the foe,"
53980,BOOK VI.(895),While his strained bowstring made a sound
53981,BOOK VI.(895),Like thunder when it shakes the ground:
53982,BOOK VI.(895),"""Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,"
53983,BOOK VI.(895),The penalty of sin to pay.
53984,BOOK VI.(895),"Stay! whither wilt thou fly, and how"
53985,BOOK VI.(895),"Escape the death that waits thee now?"""
53986,BOOK VI.(895),
53987,BOOK VI.(895),No word the giant king returned:
53988,BOOK VI.(895),His eyes with flames of fury burned.
53989,BOOK VI.(895),"His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,"
53990,BOOK VI.(895),And swift his fiery shafts were sent.
53991,BOOK VI.(895),Red torrents from the Vánar flowed:
53992,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Ráma near to Rávan strode,"
53993,BOOK VI.(895),"And with keen darts that never failed,"
53994,BOOK VI.(895),The chariot of the king assailed.
53995,BOOK VI.(895),With surest aim his arrows flew:
53996,BOOK VI.(895),The driver and the steeds he slew.
53997,BOOK VI.(895),And shattered with the pointed steel
53998,BOOK VI.(895),"Car, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel."
53999,BOOK VI.(895),As Indra hurls his bolt to smite
54000,BOOK VI.(895),"Mount Meru's heaven-ascending height,"
54001,BOOK VI.(895),So Ráma with a flaming dart
54002,BOOK VI.(895),"Struck Lanká's monarch near the heart,"
54003,BOOK VI.(895),Who reeled and fell beneath the blow
54004,BOOK VI.(895),And from loose fingers dropped his bow.
54005,BOOK VI.(895),"Bright as the sun, with crescent head,"
54006,BOOK VI.(895),"From Ráma's bow an arrow sped,"
54007,BOOK VI.(895),"And from his forehead, proud no more,"
54008,BOOK VI.(895),Cleft the bright coronet he wore.
54009,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma stood by Rávan's side
54010,BOOK VI.(895),And to the conquered giant cried:
54011,BOOK VI.(895),"""Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain"
54012,BOOK VI.(895),Strong heroes of the Vánar train.

54092,BOOK VI.(895),"They carried garlands sweet and fresh,"
54093,BOOK VI.(895),And reeking loads of blood and flesh.
54094,BOOK VI.(895),"They reached the dwelling where he lay,"
54095,BOOK VI.(895),"A cave that reached a league each way,"
54096,BOOK VI.(895),Sweet with fair blooms of lovely scent
54097,BOOK VI.(895),And bright with golden ornament.
54098,BOOK VI.(895),"His breathings came so fierce and fast,"
54099,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce could the giants brook the blast.
54100,BOOK VI.(895),They found him on a golden bed
54101,BOOK VI.(895),With his huge limbs at length outspread.
54102,BOOK VI.(895),"They piled their heaps of venison near,"
54103,BOOK VI.(895),Fat buffaloes and boars and deer.
54104,BOOK VI.(895),"With wreaths of flowers they fanned his face,"
54105,BOOK VI.(895),And incense sweetened all the place.
54106,BOOK VI.(895),Each raised his mighty voice as loud
54107,BOOK VI.(895),"As thunders of an angry cloud,"
54108,BOOK VI.(895),And conchs their stirring summons gave
54109,BOOK VI.(895),That echoed through the giant's cave.
54110,BOOK VI.(895),"Then on his breast they rained their blows,"
54111,BOOK VI.(895),And high the wild commotion rose
54112,BOOK VI.(895),When cymbal vied with drum and horn.

54115,BOOK VI.(895),"And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead."
54116,BOOK VI.(895),But still he slept and took his rest.
54117,BOOK VI.(895),Then dashed they on his shaggy chest
54118,BOOK VI.(895),"Clubs, maces, fragments of the rock:"
54119,BOOK VI.(895),"He moved not once, nor felt the shock."
54120,BOOK VI.(895),The giants made one effort more
54121,BOOK VI.(895),With shell and drum and shout and roar.
54122,BOOK VI.(895),"Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,"
54123,BOOK VI.(895),Rained blows upon his breast and side.
54124,BOOK VI.(895),"And elephants were urged to aid,"
54125,BOOK VI.(895),And camels groaned and horses neighed.
54126,BOOK VI.(895),"They drenched him with a hundred pails,"
54127,BOOK VI.(895),They tore his ears with teeth and nails.
54128,BOOK VI.(895),They bound together many a mace
54129,BOOK VI.(895),And beat him on the head and face;
54130,BOOK VI.(895),And elephants with ponderous tread
54131,BOOK VI.(895),Stamped on his limbs and chest and head.
54132,BOOK VI.(895),The unusual weight his slumber broke:
54133,BOOK VI.(895),"He started, shook his sides, and woke;"
54134,BOOK VI.(895),"And, heedless of the wounds and blows,"
54135,BOOK VI.(895),"Yawning with thirst and hunger rose,"
54136,BOOK VI.(895),"His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,"
54137,BOOK VI.(895),Dire as the flame neath ocean's tide.
54138,BOOK VI.(895),Red as the sun on Meru's crest
54139,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant's face his wrath expressed,"
54140,BOOK VI.(895),And every burning breath he drew
54141,BOOK VI.(895),Was like the blast that rushes through
54142,BOOK VI.(895),The mountain cedars. Up he raised
54143,BOOK VI.(895),His awful head with eyes that blazed
54144,BOOK VI.(895),"Like comets, dire as Death in form"
54145,BOOK VI.(895),Who threats the worlds with fire and storm.
54146,BOOK VI.(895),The giants pointed to their stores
54147,BOOK VI.(895),"Of buffaloes and deer and boars,"
54148,BOOK VI.(895),And straight he gorged him with a flood
54149,BOOK VI.(895),"Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood."
54150,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: the giants ventured near
54151,BOOK VI.(895),And bent their lowly heads in fear.
54152,BOOK VI.(895),Then Kumbhakar[n.]a glared with eyes
54153,BOOK VI.(895),"Still heavy in their first surprise,"
54154,BOOK VI.(895),"Still drowsy from his troubled rest,"
54155,BOOK VI.(895),And thus the giant band addressed.
54156,BOOK VI.(895),"""How have ye dared my sleep to break?"
54157,BOOK VI.(895),No trifling cause should bid me wake.
54158,BOOK VI.(895),"Say, is all well? or tell the need"

54551,BOOK VI.(895),Of mountain peaks and trees in flower.
54552,BOOK VI.(895),Still on his limbs their missiles rained:
54553,BOOK VI.(895),"Unmoved, their blows he still sustained,"
54554,BOOK VI.(895),And seemed unconscious of the stroke
54555,BOOK VI.(895),When rocks against his body broke.
54556,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce as the flame when woods are dry
54557,BOOK VI.(895),He charged with fury in his eye.
54558,BOOK VI.(895),Like trees consumed with fervent heat
54559,BOOK VI.(895),They fell beneath the giant's feet.
54560,BOOK VI.(895),"Some o'er the ground, dyed red with gore,"
54561,BOOK VI.(895),"Fled wild with terror to the shore,"
54562,BOOK VI.(895),"And, deeming that all hope was lost,"
54563,BOOK VI.(895),Ran to the bridge they erst had crossed.
54564,BOOK VI.(895),"Some clomb the trees their lives to save,"
54565,BOOK VI.(895),Some sought the mountain and the cave;
54566,BOOK VI.(895),"Some hid them in the bosky dell,"

54568,BOOK VI.(895),
54569,BOOK VI.(895),When Angad saw the chieftains fly
54570,BOOK VI.(895),He called them with a mighty cry:
54571,BOOK VI.(895),"""Once more, O Vánars, charge once more,"
54572,BOOK VI.(895),On to the battle as before.
54573,BOOK VI.(895),"In all her compass earth has not,"

54575,BOOK VI.(895),What! leave your arms? each nobler dame

54577,BOOK VI.(895),"This blot upon your names efface,"
54578,BOOK VI.(895),And keep your valour from disgrace.

54605,BOOK VI.(895),"Again the deadly fight began,"
54606,BOOK VI.(895),And fiercely at the giant ran.
54607,BOOK VI.(895),Unmoved the monster kept his place:
54608,BOOK VI.(895),"He raised on high his awful mace,"
54609,BOOK VI.(895),Whirled the huge weapon round his head

54613,BOOK VI.(895),"Then thirty, twenty, ten, or eight"
54614,BOOK VI.(895),"At each fierce onset met their fate,"
54615,BOOK VI.(895),And fast the fallen were devoured

54617,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Dwivid from the Vánar van,"
54618,BOOK VI.(895),"Armed with an uptorn mountain, ran,"
54619,BOOK VI.(895),"Like a huge cloud when fierce winds blow,"
54620,BOOK VI.(895),And charged amain the mountain foe.
54621,BOOK VI.(895),With wondrous force the hill he threw:
54622,BOOK VI.(895),"O'er Kumbhakarna's head it flew,"
54623,BOOK VI.(895),And falling on his host afar
54624,BOOK VI.(895),"Crushed many a giant, steed, and car."
54625,BOOK VI.(895),"Rocks, trees, by fierce Hanúmán sped,"
54626,BOOK VI.(895),Rained fast on Kumbhakarna's head.
54627,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose spear each deadlier missile stopped,"
54628,BOOK VI.(895),And harmless on the plain it dropped.
54629,BOOK VI.(895),Then with his furious eyes aglow
54630,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant rushed upon the foe,"
54631,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, with a woody hill upheaved,"
54632,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán's might his charge received.
54633,BOOK VI.(895),Through his vast frame the giant felt
54634,BOOK VI.(895),The angry blow Hanúmán dealt.
54635,BOOK VI.(895),"He reeled a moment, sore distressed,"
54636,BOOK VI.(895),"Then smote the Vánar on the breast,"
54637,BOOK VI.(895),As when the War-God's furious stroke
54638,BOOK VI.(895),Through Krauncha's hill a passage broke.(977)
54639,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce was the blow, and deep and wide"

54642,BOOK VI.(895),"Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,"
54643,BOOK VI.(895),And from each Rákshas throat rang out
54644,BOOK VI.(895),Loud clamour and exultant shout.
54645,BOOK VI.(895),Then Níla hurled with mustered might
54646,BOOK VI.(895),The fragment of a mountain height;
54647,BOOK VI.(895),"Nor would the rock the foe have missed,"
54648,BOOK VI.(895),But Kumbhakarna raised his fist
54649,BOOK VI.(895),And smote so fiercely that the mass
54650,BOOK VI.(895),Fell crushed to powder on the grass.
54651,BOOK VI.(895),Five chieftains of the Vánar race(978)
54652,BOOK VI.(895),"Charged Kumbhakarna face to face,"

54655,BOOK VI.(895),Round Rishabh first the giant wound
54656,BOOK VI.(895),"His arms and hurled him to the ground,"
54657,BOOK VI.(895),"Where speechless, senseless, wounded sore,"
54658,BOOK VI.(895),He lay his face besmeared with gore.
54659,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Níla with his fist he slew,"
54660,BOOK VI.(895),"And Sarabh with his knee o'erthrew,"
54661,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could Gaváksha's strength withstand
54662,BOOK VI.(895),The force of his terrific hand.
54663,BOOK VI.(895),At Gandhamádan's eager call
54664,BOOK VI.(895),"Rushed thousands to avenge their fall,"
54665,BOOK VI.(895),Nor ceased those Vánars to assail
54666,BOOK VI.(895),With knee and fist and tooth and nail.
54667,BOOK VI.(895),Around his foes the giant threw
54668,BOOK VI.(895),"His mighty arms, and nearer drew"
54669,BOOK VI.(895),The captives subject to his will:
54670,BOOK VI.(895),Then snatched them up and ate his fill.
54671,BOOK VI.(895),"There was no respite then, no pause:"
54672,BOOK VI.(895),Fast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:
54673,BOOK VI.(895),"Yet, prisoned in that gloomy cave,"
54674,BOOK VI.(895),Some Vánars still their lives could save:
54675,BOOK VI.(895),"Some through his nostrils found a way,"
54676,BOOK VI.(895),Some through his ears resought the day.
54677,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Indra with his thunder, like"
54678,BOOK VI.(895),"The God of Death in act to strike,"
54679,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant seized his ponderous spear,"
54680,BOOK VI.(895),And charged the foe in swift career.
54681,BOOK VI.(895),"Before his might the Vánars fell,"
54682,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could their hosts his charge repel.
54683,BOOK VI.(895),"Then trembling, nor ashamed to run,"
54684,BOOK VI.(895),They turned and fled to Raghu's son.
54685,BOOK VI.(895),
54686,BOOK VI.(895),When Báli's warrior son(979) beheld
54687,BOOK VI.(895),"Their flight, his heart with fury swelled."
54688,BOOK VI.(895),"He rushed, with his terrific shout,"
54689,BOOK VI.(895),To meet the foe and stay the rout.
54690,BOOK VI.(895),"He came, he hurled a mountain peak,"
54691,BOOK VI.(895),And smote the giant on the cheek.
54692,BOOK VI.(895),His ponderous spear the giant threw:
54693,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce was the cast, the aim was true;"
54694,BOOK VI.(895),"But Angad, trained in war and tried,"
54695,BOOK VI.(895),"Saw ere it came, and leapt aside."
54696,BOOK VI.(895),Then with his open hand he smote
54697,BOOK VI.(895),The giant on the chest and throat.
54698,BOOK VI.(895),That blow the giant scarce sustained;
54699,BOOK VI.(895),But sense and strength were soon regained.
54700,BOOK VI.(895),With force which nothing might resist
54701,BOOK VI.(895),"He caught the Vánar by the wrist,"
54702,BOOK VI.(895),"Whirled him, as if in pastime, round,"
54703,BOOK VI.(895),And dashed him senseless on the ground.
54704,BOOK VI.(895),There low on earth his foe lay crushed:
54705,BOOK VI.(895),"At King Sugríva next he rushed,"
54706,BOOK VI.(895),"Who, waiting for the charge, stood still,"
54707,BOOK VI.(895),"And heaved on high a shattered hill,"
54708,BOOK VI.(895),He looked on Kumbhakarna dyed
54709,BOOK VI.(895),"With streams of blood, and fiercely cried:"
54710,BOOK VI.(895),"""Great glory has thine arm achieved,"
54711,BOOK VI.(895),And thousands of their lives bereaved.
54712,BOOK VI.(895),"Now leave a while thy meaner foes,"
54713,BOOK VI.(895),"And brook the hill Sugríva throws."""
54714,BOOK VI.(895),
54715,BOOK VI.(895),"He spoke, and hurled the mass he held:"
54716,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant's chest the stroke repelled,"
54717,BOOK VI.(895),"Then on the Vánars fell despair,"
54718,BOOK VI.(895),And Rákshas clamour filled the air.
54719,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant raised his arm, and fast"
54720,BOOK VI.(895),Came the tremendous(980) spear he cast.
54721,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán caught it as it flew,"
54722,BOOK VI.(895),And knapped it on his knee in two.
54723,BOOK VI.(895),The giant saw the broken spear:
54724,BOOK VI.(895),His clouded eye confessed his fear;
54725,BOOK VI.(895),Yet at Sugríva's head he sent
54726,BOOK VI.(895),A peak from Lanká's mountain rent.
54727,BOOK VI.(895),The rushing mass no might could stay:
54728,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva fell and senseless lay.
54729,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant stooped his foe to seize,"
54730,BOOK VI.(895),"And bore him thence, as bears the breeze"
54731,BOOK VI.(895),A cloud in autumn through the sky.
54732,BOOK VI.(895),"He heard the sad Immortals sigh,"
54733,BOOK VI.(895),And shouts of triumph long and loud
54734,BOOK VI.(895),Went up from all the Rákshas crowd.
54735,BOOK VI.(895),Through Lanká's gate the giant passed
54736,BOOK VI.(895),"Holding his struggling captive fast,"
54737,BOOK VI.(895),"While from each terrace, house, and tower"
54738,BOOK VI.(895),Fell on his haughty head a shower
54739,BOOK VI.(895),"Of fragrant scent and flowery rain,"
54740,BOOK VI.(895),Blossoms and leaves and scattered grain.(981)
54741,BOOK VI.(895),
54742,BOOK VI.(895),By slow degrees the Vánars' lord
54743,BOOK VI.(895),Felt life and sense and strength restored.
54744,BOOK VI.(895),He heard the giants' joyful boast:
54745,BOOK VI.(895),He thought upon his Vánar host.
54746,BOOK VI.(895),"His teeth and feet he fiercely plied,"
54747,BOOK VI.(895),"And bit and rent the giant's side,"
54748,BOOK VI.(895),"Who, mad with pain and smeared with gore,"
54749,BOOK VI.(895),Hurled to the ground the load he bore.
54750,BOOK VI.(895),Regardless of a storm of blows
54751,BOOK VI.(895),"Swift to the sky the Vánar rose,"
54752,BOOK VI.(895),Then lightly like a flying ball
54753,BOOK VI.(895),"High overleapt the city wall,"
54754,BOOK VI.(895),And joyous for deliverance won
54755,BOOK VI.(895),Regained the side of Raghu's son.
54756,BOOK VI.(895),"And Kumbhakarna, mad with hate"
54757,BOOK VI.(895),"And fury, sallied from the gate,"
54758,BOOK VI.(895),The carnage of the foe renewed
54759,BOOK VI.(895),And filled his maw with gory food.
54760,BOOK VI.(895),"Slaying, with headlong frenzy blind,"
54761,BOOK VI.(895),Both Vánar foes and giant kind.
54762,BOOK VI.(895),
54763,BOOK VI.(895),Nor would Sumitrá's valiant son(982)
54764,BOOK VI.(895),"The might of Kumbhakarna shun,"
54765,BOOK VI.(895),Who through his harness felt the sting
54766,BOOK VI.(895),Of keen shafts loosened from the string.
54767,BOOK VI.(895),"His heart confessed the warrior's power,"
54768,BOOK VI.(895),"And, bleeding from the ceaseless shower"
54769,BOOK VI.(895),"That smote him on the chest and side,"
54770,BOOK VI.(895),With words like these the giant cried:
54771,BOOK VI.(895),"""Well fought, well fought, Sumitrá's son;"
54772,BOOK VI.(895),"Eternal glory hast thou won,"
54773,BOOK VI.(895),For thou in desperate fight hast met
54774,BOOK VI.(895),"The victor never conquered yet,"
54775,BOOK VI.(895),"Whom, borne on huge Airávat's back,"
54776,BOOK VI.(895),E'en Indra trembles to attack.
54777,BOOK VI.(895),"Go, son of Queen Sumitrá, go:"
54778,BOOK VI.(895),Thy valour and thy strength I know.
54779,BOOK VI.(895),Now all my hope and earnest will
54780,BOOK VI.(895),Is Ráma in the fight to kill.
54781,BOOK VI.(895),"Let him beneath my weapons fall,"
54782,BOOK VI.(895),"And I will meet and conquer all."""
54783,BOOK VI.(895),
54784,BOOK VI.(895),"The chieftain, of Sumitrá born,"
54785,BOOK VI.(895),Made answer as he laughed in scorn:
54786,BOOK VI.(895),"""Yea, thou hast won a victor's fame"
54787,BOOK VI.(895),From trembling Gods and Indra's shame.
54788,BOOK VI.(895),There waits thee now a mightier foe
54789,BOOK VI.(895),Whose prowess thou hast yet to know.
54790,BOOK VI.(895),"There, famous in a hundred lands,"
54791,BOOK VI.(895),"Ráma the son of Raghu stands."""
54792,BOOK VI.(895),
54793,BOOK VI.(895),"Straight at the king the giant sped,"
54794,BOOK VI.(895),And earth was shaken at his tread.
54795,BOOK VI.(895),"His bow the hero grasped and strained,"
54796,BOOK VI.(895),And deadly shafts in torrents rained.
54797,BOOK VI.(895),As Kumbhakarna felt each stroke
54798,BOOK VI.(895),From his huge mouth burst fire and smoke;
54799,BOOK VI.(895),His hands were loosed in mortal pain
54800,BOOK VI.(895),And dropped his weapons on the plain.
54801,BOOK VI.(895),Though reft of spear and sword and mace
54802,BOOK VI.(895),No terror changed his haughty face.
54803,BOOK VI.(895),With heavy hands he rained his blows
54804,BOOK VI.(895),And smote to death a thousand foes.
54805,BOOK VI.(895),Where'er the furious monster strode
54806,BOOK VI.(895),While down his limbs the red blood flowed
54807,BOOK VI.(895),"Like torrents down a mountain's side,"
54808,BOOK VI.(895),Vánars and bears and giants died.
54809,BOOK VI.(895),"High o'er his head a rock he swung,"
54810,BOOK VI.(895),And the huge mass at Ráma flung.
54811,BOOK VI.(895),But Ráma's arrows bright as flame
54812,BOOK VI.(895),Shattered the mountain as it came.
54813,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Raghu's son, his eyes aglow"
54814,BOOK VI.(895),"With burning anger, charged the foe,"
54815,BOOK VI.(895),And as his bow he strained and tried
54816,BOOK VI.(895),With fearful clang the cord replied.
54817,BOOK VI.(895),Wroth at the bowstring's threatening clang
54818,BOOK VI.(895),To meet his foe the giant sprang.
54819,BOOK VI.(895),High towering with enormous frame
54820,BOOK VI.(895),Huge as a wood-crowned hill he came.
54821,BOOK VI.(895),But Ráma firm and self-possessed
54822,BOOK VI.(895),In words like these the foe addressed:
54823,BOOK VI.(895),"""Draw near, O Rákshas lord, draw near,"
54824,BOOK VI.(895),Nor turn thee from the fight in fear.
54825,BOOK VI.(895),"Thou meetest Ráma face to face,"
54826,BOOK VI.(895),Destroyer of the giant race.
54827,BOOK VI.(895),"Come, fight, and thou shalt feel this hour,"
54828,BOOK VI.(895),"Laid low in death, thy conqueror's power."""
54829,BOOK VI.(895),
54830,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: and mad with wrath and pride
54831,BOOK VI.(895),The giant champion thus replied:
54832,BOOK VI.(895),"""Come thou to me and thou shalt find"
54833,BOOK VI.(895),A foeman of a different kind.
54834,BOOK VI.(895),"No Khara, no Virádha,--thou"
54835,BOOK VI.(895),Hast met a mightier warrior now.
54836,BOOK VI.(895),"The strength of Kumbhakarna fear,"
54837,BOOK VI.(895),And dread the iron mace I rear
54838,BOOK VI.(895),This mace in days of yore subdued
54839,BOOK VI.(895),The Gods and Dánav multitude.
54840,BOOK VI.(895),"Prove, lion of Ikshváku's line,"
54841,BOOK VI.(895),Thy power upon these limbs of mine.
54842,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, after trial, shalt thou bleed,"
54843,BOOK VI.(895),"And with thy flesh my hunger feed."""
54844,BOOK VI.(895),
54845,BOOK VI.(895),"He ceased: and Ráma, undismayed,"
54846,BOOK VI.(895),Upon his cord those arrows laid
54847,BOOK VI.(895),"Which pierced the stately Sál trees through,"
54848,BOOK VI.(895),And Báli king of Vánars slew.
54849,BOOK VI.(895),"They flew, they smote, but smote in vain"
54850,BOOK VI.(895),Those mighty limbs that felt no pain.
54851,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma sent with surest aim
54852,BOOK VI.(895),The dart that bore the Wind-God's name.
54853,BOOK VI.(895),The missile from the giant tore
54854,BOOK VI.(895),"His huge arm and the mace it bore,"
54855,BOOK VI.(895),Which crushed the Vánars where it fell:
54856,BOOK VI.(895),And dire was Kumbhakarna's yell.
54857,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant seized a tree, and then"
54858,BOOK VI.(895),Rushed madly at the lord of men.
54859,BOOK VI.(895),"Another dart, Lord Indra's own,"
54860,BOOK VI.(895),"To meet his furious onset thrown,"
54861,BOOK VI.(895),"His left arm from the shoulder lopped,"
54862,BOOK VI.(895),And like a mountain peak it dropped.
54863,BOOK VI.(895),Then from the bow of Ráma sped
54864,BOOK VI.(895),"Two arrows, each with crescent head;"
54865,BOOK VI.(895),"And, winged with might which naught could stay,"
54866,BOOK VI.(895),They cut the giant's legs away.
54867,BOOK VI.(895),"They fell, and awful was the sound"
54868,BOOK VI.(895),As those vast columns shook the ground;
54869,BOOK VI.(895),And sky and sea and hill and cave
54870,BOOK VI.(895),In echoing roars their answer gave.
54871,BOOK VI.(895),Then from his side the hero drew
54872,BOOK VI.(895),A dart that like the tempest flew--
54873,BOOK VI.(895),No deadlier shaft has ever flown
54874,BOOK VI.(895),Than that which Indra called his own--
54875,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could the giant's mail-armed neck
54876,BOOK VI.(895),The fury of the missile check.
54877,BOOK VI.(895),Through skin and flesh and bone it smote
54878,BOOK VI.(895),And rent asunder head and throat.
54879,BOOK VI.(895),Down with the sound of thunder rolled
54880,BOOK VI.(895),"The head adorned with rings of gold,"
54881,BOOK VI.(895),And crushed to pieces in its fall
54882,BOOK VI.(895),"A gate, a tower, a massive wall."
54883,BOOK VI.(895),Hurled to the sea the body fell:
54884,BOOK VI.(895),"Terrific was the ocean's swell,"
54885,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could swift fin and nimble leap
54886,BOOK VI.(895),Save the crushed creatures of the deep.
54887,BOOK VI.(895),
54888,BOOK VI.(895),Thus he who plagued in impious pride
54889,BOOK VI.(895),The Gods and Bráhmans fought and died.
54890,BOOK VI.(895),"Glad were the hosts of heaven, and long"
54891,BOOK VI.(895),The air re-echoed with their song.(983)

54898,BOOK VI.(895),
54899,BOOK VI.(895),They ran to Rávan in his hall
54900,BOOK VI.(895),And told him of his brother's fall:
54901,BOOK VI.(895),"""Fierce as the God who rules the dead,"
54902,BOOK VI.(895),Upon the routed foe he fed;
54903,BOOK VI.(895),"And, victor for a while, at length"
54904,BOOK VI.(895),Fell slain by Ráma's matchless strength.
54905,BOOK VI.(895),Now like a mighty hill in size
54906,BOOK VI.(895),"His mangled trunk extended lies,"
54907,BOOK VI.(895),"And where he fell, a bleeding mass,"
54908,BOOK VI.(895),"Blocks Lanká's gate that none may pass."""
54909,BOOK VI.(895),The monarch heard: his strength gave way;
54910,BOOK VI.(895),And fainting on the ground he lay.
54911,BOOK VI.(895),"Grieved at the giants' mournful tale,"
54912,BOOK VI.(895),"Long, shrill was Atikáya's wail;"
54913,BOOK VI.(895),And Trisirás in sorrow bowed
54914,BOOK VI.(895),"His triple head, and wept aloud."
54915,BOOK VI.(895),"Mahodar, Mahápársva shed"
54916,BOOK VI.(895),Hot tears and mourned their brother dead.
54917,BOOK VI.(895),"At length, his wandering sense restored,"
54918,BOOK VI.(895),In loud lament cried Lanká's lord:
54919,BOOK VI.(895),"""Ah chief, for might and valour famed,"
54920,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose arm the haughty foeman tamed,"
54921,BOOK VI.(895),"Forsaking me, thy friends and all,"
54922,BOOK VI.(895),Why hast thou fled to Yáma's hall?
54923,BOOK VI.(895),Why hast thou fled to taste no more
54924,BOOK VI.(895),The slaughtered foeman's flesh and gore?
54925,BOOK VI.(895),"Ah me, my life is done to-day:"
54926,BOOK VI.(895),My better arm is lopped away.
54927,BOOK VI.(895),"Whereon in danger I relied,"
54928,BOOK VI.(895),"And, fearless, Gods and fiends defied."
54929,BOOK VI.(895),How could a shaft from Ráma's bow
54930,BOOK VI.(895),"The matchless giant overthrow,"
54931,BOOK VI.(895),Whose iron frame so strong of yore
54932,BOOK VI.(895),The crushing bolt of Indra bore?
54933,BOOK VI.(895),This day the Gods and sages meet
54934,BOOK VI.(895),And triumph at their foe's defeat.
54935,BOOK VI.(895),This day the Vánar chiefs will boast
54936,BOOK VI.(895),"And, with new ardour fired, their host"
54937,BOOK VI.(895),In fiercer onset will assail
54938,BOOK VI.(895),"Our city, and the ramparts scale."
54939,BOOK VI.(895),"What care I for a monarch's name,"
54940,BOOK VI.(895),"For empire, or the Maithil dame?"
54941,BOOK VI.(895),"What joy can power and riches give,"
54942,BOOK VI.(895),"Or life that I should care to live,"
54943,BOOK VI.(895),Unless this arm in mortal fray
54944,BOOK VI.(895),The slayer of my brother slay?
54945,BOOK VI.(895),"For me, of Kumbhakarna reft,"
54946,BOOK VI.(895),Death is the only solace left;
54947,BOOK VI.(895),"And I will seek, o'erwhelmed with woes,"

54989,BOOK VI.(895),"Devántak and Narántak heard,"
54990,BOOK VI.(895),And their fierce souls with joy were stirred;
54991,BOOK VI.(895),"And Atikáya(987) burned to fight,"
54992,BOOK VI.(895),And heard the summons with delight;
54993,BOOK VI.(895),"While from the rest loud rang the cry,"

54999,BOOK VI.(895),Of benison and praise to each.
55000,BOOK VI.(895),Forth from the gate the princes sped
55001,BOOK VI.(895),And ranged for war the troops they led.
55002,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánar legions charged anew,"
55003,BOOK VI.(895),And trees and rocks for missiles flew.
55004,BOOK VI.(895),They saw Narántak's mighty form
55005,BOOK VI.(895),Borne on a steed that mocked the storm.
55006,BOOK VI.(895),To check his charge in vain they strove:
55007,BOOK VI.(895),"Straight through their host his way he clove,"
55008,BOOK VI.(895),As springs a dolphin through the tide:
55009,BOOK VI.(895),"And countless Vánars fell and died,"
55010,BOOK VI.(895),And mangled limbs and corpses lay
55011,BOOK VI.(895),"To mark the chief's ensanguined way,"

55013,BOOK VI.(895),"When fierce Narántak's steed was nigh,"

55027,BOOK VI.(895),Narántak heard the words he spake:

55029,BOOK VI.(895),With bloody teeth his lips he pressed
55030,BOOK VI.(895),And hurled his dart at Angad's breast.
55031,BOOK VI.(895),"True was the aim and fierce the stroke,"
55032,BOOK VI.(895),Yet on his breast the missile broke.
55033,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Angad at the giant flew,"
55034,BOOK VI.(895),And with a blow his courser slew:
55035,BOOK VI.(895),"The fierce hand crushed through flesh and bone,"
55036,BOOK VI.(895),And steed and rider fell o'erthrown.
55037,BOOK VI.(895),Narántak's eyes with fury blazed:
55038,BOOK VI.(895),His heavy hand on high he raised
55039,BOOK VI.(895),And struck in savage wrath the head
55040,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Báli's son, who reeled and bled,"
55041,BOOK VI.(895),Fainted a moment and no more:
55042,BOOK VI.(895),"Then stronger, fiercer than before"
55043,BOOK VI.(895),"Smote with that fist which naught could stay,"
55044,BOOK VI.(895),And crushed to death the giant lay.

55051,BOOK VI.(895),
55052,BOOK VI.(895),"Then raged the Rákshas chiefs, and all"
55053,BOOK VI.(895),Burned to avenge Narántak's fall.
55054,BOOK VI.(895),Devántak raised his club on high
55055,BOOK VI.(895),And rushed at Angad with a cry.
55056,BOOK VI.(895),"Behind came Trisirás, and near"
55057,BOOK VI.(895),Mahodar charged with levelled spear.
55058,BOOK VI.(895),There Angad stood to fight with three:
55059,BOOK VI.(895),"High o'er his head he waved a tree,"
55060,BOOK VI.(895),"And at Devántak, swift and true"
55061,BOOK VI.(895),"As Indra's flaming bolt, it flew."
55062,BOOK VI.(895),"But, cut by giant shafts in twain,"
55063,BOOK VI.(895),With minished force it flew in vain.
55064,BOOK VI.(895),A shower of trees and blocks of stone
55065,BOOK VI.(895),From Angad's hand was fiercely thrown;
55066,BOOK VI.(895),But well his club Devántak plied
55067,BOOK VI.(895),And turned each rock and tree aside.
55068,BOOK VI.(895),"Nor yet, by three such foes assailed,"
55069,BOOK VI.(895),The heart of Angad sank or quailed.
55070,BOOK VI.(895),He slew the mighty beast that bore
55071,BOOK VI.(895),Mahodar: from his head he tore
55072,BOOK VI.(895),"A bleeding tusk, and blow on blow"
55073,BOOK VI.(895),Fell fiercely on his Rákshas foe.
55074,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant reeled, but strength regained,"
55075,BOOK VI.(895),"And furious strokes on Angad rained,"
55076,BOOK VI.(895),"Who, wounded by the storm of blows,"
55077,BOOK VI.(895),"Sank on his knees, but swiftly rose."
55078,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Trisirás, as up he sprang,"
55079,BOOK VI.(895),"Drew his great bow with awful clang,"
55080,BOOK VI.(895),And fixed three arrows from his sheaf
55081,BOOK VI.(895),Full in the forehead of the chief.
55082,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán saw, nor long delayed"
55083,BOOK VI.(895),"To speed with Níla to his aid,"
55084,BOOK VI.(895),Who at the three-faced giant sent
55085,BOOK VI.(895),A peak from Lanká's mountain rent.
55086,BOOK VI.(895),But Trisirás with certain aim
55087,BOOK VI.(895),Shot rapid arrows as it came:
55088,BOOK VI.(895),And shivered by their force it broke
55089,BOOK VI.(895),And fell to earth with flash and smoke.
55090,BOOK VI.(895),"Then as the Wind-God's son came nigh,"
55091,BOOK VI.(895),Devántak reared his mace on high.
55092,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán smote him on the head
55093,BOOK VI.(895),And stretched the monstrous giant dead.
55094,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce Trisirás with fury strained
55095,BOOK VI.(895),"His bow, and showers of arrows rained"
55096,BOOK VI.(895),That smote on Níla's side and chest:
55097,BOOK VI.(895),"He sank a moment, sore distressed;"
55098,BOOK VI.(895),But quickly gathered strength to seize
55099,BOOK VI.(895),A mountain with its crown of trees.
55100,BOOK VI.(895),"Crushed by the hill, distained with gore,"
55101,BOOK VI.(895),Mahodar fell to rise no more.
55102,BOOK VI.(895),
55103,BOOK VI.(895),Then Trisirás raised high his spear
55104,BOOK VI.(895),Which chilled the trembling foe with fear
55105,BOOK VI.(895),"And, like a flashing meteor through"
55106,BOOK VI.(895),The air at Hanúmán it flew.
55107,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánar shunned the threatened stroke,"
55108,BOOK VI.(895),And with strong hands the weapon broke.
55109,BOOK VI.(895),The giant drew his glittering blade:
55110,BOOK VI.(895),Dire was the wound the weapon made
55111,BOOK VI.(895),"Deep in the Vánar's ample chest,"
55112,BOOK VI.(895),"Who, for a moment sore oppressed,"
55113,BOOK VI.(895),"Raised his broad hand, regaining might,"
55114,BOOK VI.(895),And struck the rover of the night.
55115,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce was the blow: with one wild yell
55116,BOOK VI.(895),Low on the earth the monster fell.
55117,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán seized his fallen sword
55118,BOOK VI.(895),"Which served no more its senseless lord,"
55119,BOOK VI.(895),And from the monster triple-necked
55120,BOOK VI.(895),Smote his huge heads with crowns bedecked.
55121,BOOK VI.(895),Then Mahápársva burned with ire;
55122,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce flashed his eyes with vengeful fire.
55123,BOOK VI.(895),"A moment on the dead he gazed,"
55124,BOOK VI.(895),"Then his black mace aloft was raised,"
55125,BOOK VI.(895),And down the mass of iron came
55126,BOOK VI.(895),That struck and shook the Vánar's frame.
55127,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán's chest was wellnigh crushed,"
55128,BOOK VI.(895),And from his mouth red torrents gushed:
55129,BOOK VI.(895),Yet served one instant to restore
55130,BOOK VI.(895),His spirit: from the foe he tore
55131,BOOK VI.(895),"His awful mace, and smote, and laid"
55132,BOOK VI.(895),The giant in the dust dismayed.
55133,BOOK VI.(895),Crushed were his jaws and teeth and eyes:
55134,BOOK VI.(895),Breathless and still he lay as lies
55135,BOOK VI.(895),A summit from a mountain rent
55136,BOOK VI.(895),By him who rules the firmament.

55142,BOOK VI.(895),
55143,BOOK VI.(895),
55144,BOOK VI.(895),But Atikáya's wrath grew high
55145,BOOK VI.(895),To see his noblest kinsmen die.
55146,BOOK VI.(895),"He, fiercest of the giant race,"
55147,BOOK VI.(895),Presuming still on Brahmá's grace;
55148,BOOK VI.(895),"Proud tamer of the Immortals' pride,"
55149,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose power and might with Indra's vied,"
55150,BOOK VI.(895),"For blood and vengeful carnage burned,"
55151,BOOK VI.(895),And on the foe his fury turned.
55152,BOOK VI.(895),High on a car that flashed and glowed
55153,BOOK VI.(895),Bright as a thousand suns he rode.
55154,BOOK VI.(895),Around his princely brows was set
55155,BOOK VI.(895),A rich bejewelled coronet.
55156,BOOK VI.(895),Gold pendants in his ears he wore;
55157,BOOK VI.(895),"He strained and tried the bow he bore,"
55158,BOOK VI.(895),"And ever, as a shaft he aimed,"
55159,BOOK VI.(895),His name and royal race proclaimed.
55160,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce might the Vánars brook to hear
55161,BOOK VI.(895),His clanging bow and voice of fear:
55162,BOOK VI.(895),"To Raghu's elder son they fled,"
55163,BOOK VI.(895),Their sure defence in woe and dread.
55164,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma bent his eyes afar
55165,BOOK VI.(895),And saw the giant in his car
55166,BOOK VI.(895),Fast following the flying crowd
55167,BOOK VI.(895),And roaring like a rainy cloud.
55168,BOOK VI.(895),"He, with the lust of battle fired,"
55169,BOOK VI.(895),Turned to Vibhishan and inquired:
55170,BOOK VI.(895),"""Say, who is this, of mountain size,"
55171,BOOK VI.(895),This archer with the lion eyes?
55172,BOOK VI.(895),"His car, which strikes our host with awe,"
55173,BOOK VI.(895),A thousand eager coursers draw.
55174,BOOK VI.(895),Surrounded by the flashing spears
55175,BOOK VI.(895),"Which line his car, the chief appears"
55176,BOOK VI.(895),Like some huge cloud when lightnings play
55177,BOOK VI.(895),About it on a stormy day;
55178,BOOK VI.(895),And the great bow he joys to hold
55179,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose bended back is bright with gold,"
55180,BOOK VI.(895),"As Indra's bow makes glad the skies,"
55181,BOOK VI.(895),That best of chariots glorifies.
55182,BOOK VI.(895),O see the sunlike splendour flung
55183,BOOK VI.(895),"From the great flag above him hung,"
55184,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, blazoned with refulgent lines,"
55185,BOOK VI.(895),Ráhu(988) the dreadful Dragon shines.
55186,BOOK VI.(895),"Full thirty quivers near his side,"
55187,BOOK VI.(895),His car with shafts is well supplied:
55188,BOOK VI.(895),And flashing like the light of stars
55189,BOOK VI.(895),Gleam his two mighty scimitars.
55190,BOOK VI.(895),"Say, best of giants, who is he"
55191,BOOK VI.(895),"Before whose face the Vánars flee?"""
55192,BOOK VI.(895),
55193,BOOK VI.(895),Thus Ráma spake. Vibhishan eyed
55194,BOOK VI.(895),"The giants' chief, and thus replied:"
55195,BOOK VI.(895),"""This Ráma, this is Rávan's son:"
55196,BOOK VI.(895),High fame his youthful might has won.
55197,BOOK VI.(895),"He, best of warriors, bows his ear"
55198,BOOK VI.(895),The wisdom of the wise to hear.
55199,BOOK VI.(895),Supreme is he mid those who know
55200,BOOK VI.(895),The mastery of sword and bow.
55201,BOOK VI.(895),Unrivalled in the bold attack
55202,BOOK VI.(895),"On elephant's or courser's back,"
55203,BOOK VI.(895),"He knows, beside, each subtler art,"
55204,BOOK VI.(895),"To win the foe, to bribe, or part."
55205,BOOK VI.(895),"On him the giant hosts rely,"
55206,BOOK VI.(895),And fear no ill when he is nigh.
55207,BOOK VI.(895),This peerless chieftain bears the name
55208,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Atikáya huge of frame,"

55213,BOOK VI.(895),To meet their foes the Vánars sprang.
55214,BOOK VI.(895),"Armed with tall trees from Lanká's wood,"
55215,BOOK VI.(895),"And rocks and mountain peaks, they stood."
55216,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant's arrows, gold-bedecked,"
55217,BOOK VI.(895),The storm of hurtling missiles checked;
55218,BOOK VI.(895),And ever on his foemen poured
55219,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce tempest from his clanging cord;
55220,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could the Vánar chiefs sustain
55221,BOOK VI.(895),His shafts' intolerable rain.
55222,BOOK VI.(895),They fled: the victor gained the place
55223,BOOK VI.(895),"Where stood the lord of Raghu's race,"
55224,BOOK VI.(895),"And cried with voice of thunder: ""Lo,"
55225,BOOK VI.(895),"Borne on my car, with shaft and bow,"
55226,BOOK VI.(895),"I, champion of the giants, scorn"
55227,BOOK VI.(895),To fight with weaklings humbly born.

55230,BOOK VI.(895),
55231,BOOK VI.(895),"Forth sprang Sumitrá's noble child,(989)"
55232,BOOK VI.(895),"And strained his ready bow, and smiled;"
55233,BOOK VI.(895),And giants trembled as the clang
55234,BOOK VI.(895),Through heaven and earth reëchoing rang.
55235,BOOK VI.(895),The giant to his string applied
55236,BOOK VI.(895),"A pointed shaft, and proudly cried;"
55237,BOOK VI.(895),"""Turn, turn, Sumitrá's son and fly,"
55238,BOOK VI.(895),For terrible as Death am I.
55239,BOOK VI.(895),"Fly, nor that youthful form oppose,"
55240,BOOK VI.(895),"Untrained in war, to warriors' blows."
55241,BOOK VI.(895),What! wilt thou waste thy childish breath
55242,BOOK VI.(895),And wake the dormant fire of death?

55244,BOOK VI.(895),"Preserve thy life, uninjured go."""
55245,BOOK VI.(895),
55246,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: and stirred by wrath & pride
55247,BOOK VI.(895),Sumitrá's noble son replied:
55248,BOOK VI.(895),"""By warlike deed, not words alone,"
55249,BOOK VI.(895),The valour of the brave is shown.
55250,BOOK VI.(895),"Cease with vain boasts my scorn to move,"
55251,BOOK VI.(895),And with thine arm thy prowess prove.
55252,BOOK VI.(895),"Borne on thy car, with sword and bow,"

55259,BOOK VI.(895),"His giant foe no answer made,"
55260,BOOK VI.(895),But on his string an arrow laid.
55261,BOOK VI.(895),"He raised his arm, the cord he drew,"
55262,BOOK VI.(895),At Lakshman's breast the arrow flew.
55263,BOOK VI.(895),"Sumitrá's son, his foemen's dread,"
55264,BOOK VI.(895),"Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,"
55265,BOOK VI.(895),"Which cleft that arrow pointed well,"
55266,BOOK VI.(895),And harmless to the earth it fell.
55267,BOOK VI.(895),A shower of shafts from Lakshman's bow
55268,BOOK VI.(895),Fell fast and furious on the foe
55269,BOOK VI.(895),Who quailed not as the missiles smote
55270,BOOK VI.(895),With idle force his iron coat.
55271,BOOK VI.(895),"Then came the friendly Wind-God near,"
55272,BOOK VI.(895),And whispered thus in Lakshman's ear:
55273,BOOK VI.(895),"""Such shafts as these in vain assail"
55274,BOOK VI.(895),Thy foe's impenetrable mail.
55275,BOOK VI.(895),"A more tremendous missile try,"
55276,BOOK VI.(895),Or never may the giant die.

55282,BOOK VI.(895),"As Indra's flashing bolt, it flew."
55283,BOOK VI.(895),The giant poured his shafts like rain
55284,BOOK VI.(895),"To check its course, but all in vain."
55285,BOOK VI.(895),With spear and mace and sword he tried
55286,BOOK VI.(895),To turn the fiery dart aside.
55287,BOOK VI.(895),"Winged with a force which naught could check,"
55288,BOOK VI.(895),"It smote the monster in the neck,"

55371,BOOK VI.(895),"There on the ground were spear and blade,"
55372,BOOK VI.(895),And arrowy leaves and fuel laid;
55373,BOOK VI.(895),"An iron ladle deep and wide,"
55374,BOOK VI.(895),And robes with sanguine colours dyed.
55375,BOOK VI.(895),Beside him stood a sable goat:
55376,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant seized it by the throat,"
55377,BOOK VI.(895),And straight from the consuming flame
55378,BOOK VI.(895),Auspicious signs of victory came.
55379,BOOK VI.(895),"For swiftly, curling to the right,"
55380,BOOK VI.(895),The fire leapt up with willing light
55381,BOOK VI.(895),"Undimmed by smoky cloud, and, red"
55382,BOOK VI.(895),"Like gold, upon the offering fed."
55383,BOOK VI.(895),"They brought him, while the flame yet glowed,"
55384,BOOK VI.(895),"The dart by Brahmá's grace bestowed,"
55385,BOOK VI.(895),And all the arms he wielded well
55386,BOOK VI.(895),Were charmed with text and holy spell.
55387,BOOK VI.(895),
55388,BOOK VI.(895),"Then fiercer for the fight he burned,"
55389,BOOK VI.(895),"And at the foe his chariot turned,"
55390,BOOK VI.(895),While all his followers lifting high
55391,BOOK VI.(895),Their maces charged with furious cry.
55392,BOOK VI.(895),"Dire, yet more dire the battle grew,"
55393,BOOK VI.(895),As rocks and trees and arrows flew.
55394,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant shot his shafts like rain,"
55395,BOOK VI.(895),"And Vánars fell in myriads slain,"
55396,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva, Angad, Níla felt"
55397,BOOK VI.(895),The wounds his hurtling arrows dealt.
55398,BOOK VI.(895),His shafts the blood of Gaya drank;
55399,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán reeled and Mainda sank.
55400,BOOK VI.(895),Bright as the glances of the sun
55401,BOOK VI.(895),Came the swift darts they could not shun.
55402,BOOK VI.(895),"Caught in the arrowy nets he wove,"
55403,BOOK VI.(895),In vain the sons of Raghu strove;
55404,BOOK VI.(895),"And Ráma, by the darts oppressed,"
55405,BOOK VI.(895),His brother chieftain thus addressed:
55406,BOOK VI.(895),"""See, first this giant warrior sends"
55407,BOOK VI.(895),"Destruction, mid our Vánar friends,"
55408,BOOK VI.(895),And now his arrows thick and fast
55409,BOOK VI.(895),Their binding net around us cast.
55410,BOOK VI.(895),To Brahmá's grace the chieftain owes
55411,BOOK VI.(895),The matchless power and might he shows;
55412,BOOK VI.(895),And mortal strength in vain contends
55413,BOOK VI.(895),With him whom Brahmá's self befriends.
55414,BOOK VI.(895),Then let us still with dauntless hearts
55415,BOOK VI.(895),Endure this storm of pelting darts.
55416,BOOK VI.(895),Soon must we sink bereaved of sense;
55417,BOOK VI.(895),"And then the victor, hurrying hence,"
55418,BOOK VI.(895),Will seek his father in his hall
55419,BOOK VI.(895),"And tell him of his foemen's fall."""
55420,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: o'erpowered by shaft and spell
55421,BOOK VI.(895),The sons of Raghu reeled and fell.
55422,BOOK VI.(895),The Rákshas on their bodies gazed;
55423,BOOK VI.(895),"And, mid the shouts his followers raised,"
55424,BOOK VI.(895),Sped back to Lanká to relate
55425,BOOK VI.(895),In Rávan's hall the princes' fate.

55435,BOOK VI.(895),"Which, bearing each a blazing brand,"
55436,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán and Vibhishan scanned,"
55437,BOOK VI.(895),Moving with slow and anxious tread
55438,BOOK VI.(895),Among the dying and the dead.
55439,BOOK VI.(895),Sad was the scene of slaughter shown
55440,BOOK VI.(895),Where'er the torches' light was thrown.
55441,BOOK VI.(895),Here mountain forms of Vánars lay
55442,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose heads and limbs were lopped away,"
55443,BOOK VI.(895),"Arms, legs and fingers strewed the ground,"
55444,BOOK VI.(895),And severed heads lay thick around.
55445,BOOK VI.(895),"The earth was moist with sanguine streams,"
55446,BOOK VI.(895),And sighs were heard and groans and screams.
55447,BOOK VI.(895),"There lay Sugríva still and cold,"

55449,BOOK VI.(895),"There Jámbaván his might reposed,"
55450,BOOK VI.(895),There Vegadarsí's eyes were closed;
55451,BOOK VI.(895),"There in the dust was Nala's pride,"
55452,BOOK VI.(895),And Dwivid lay by Mainda's side.
55453,BOOK VI.(895),Where'er they looked the ensanguined plain
55454,BOOK VI.(895),Was strewn with myriads of the slain;(990)
55455,BOOK VI.(895),They sought with keenly searching eyes
55456,BOOK VI.(895),King Jámbaván supremely wise.
55457,BOOK VI.(895),"His strength had failed by slow decay,"
55458,BOOK VI.(895),And pierced with countless shafts he lay.
55459,BOOK VI.(895),"They saw, and hastened to his side,"
55460,BOOK VI.(895),And thus the sage Vibhishan cried:
55461,BOOK VI.(895),"""Thee, monarch of the bears, we seek:"
55462,BOOK VI.(895),"Speak if thou yet art living, speak."""
55463,BOOK VI.(895),
55464,BOOK VI.(895),Slow came the aged chief's reply;
55465,BOOK VI.(895),Scarce could he say with many a sigh:
55466,BOOK VI.(895),"""Torn with keen shafts which pierce each limb,"
55467,BOOK VI.(895),"My strength is gone, my sight is dim;"
55468,BOOK VI.(895),"Yet though I scarce can raise mine eyes,"
55469,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy voice, O chief, I recognize."
55470,BOOK VI.(895),"O, while these ears can hear thee, say,"
55471,BOOK VI.(895),"Has Hanúmán survived this day?"""
55472,BOOK VI.(895),
55473,BOOK VI.(895),"""Why ask,"" Vibhishan cried, ""for one"
55474,BOOK VI.(895),"Of lower rank, the Wind-God's son?"
55475,BOOK VI.(895),"Hast thou forgotten, first in place,"
55476,BOOK VI.(895),The princely chief of Raghu's race?
55477,BOOK VI.(895),"Can King Sugríva claim no care,"
55478,BOOK VI.(895),"And Angad, his imperial heir?"""
55479,BOOK VI.(895),
55480,BOOK VI.(895),"""Yea, dearer than my noblest friends"
55481,BOOK VI.(895),Is he on whom our hope depends.
55482,BOOK VI.(895),"For if the Wind-God's son survive,"
55483,BOOK VI.(895),All we though dead are yet alive.
55484,BOOK VI.(895),But if his precious life be fled
55485,BOOK VI.(895),Though living still we are but dead:
55486,BOOK VI.(895),"He is our hope and sure relief."""
55487,BOOK VI.(895),Thus slowly spoke the aged chief:
55488,BOOK VI.(895),"Then to his side Hanúmán came,"
55489,BOOK VI.(895),And with low reverence named his name.
55490,BOOK VI.(895),Cheered by the face he longed to view
55491,BOOK VI.(895),The wounded chieftain lived anew.
55492,BOOK VI.(895),"""Go forth,"" he cried, ""O strong and brave,"
55493,BOOK VI.(895),And in their woe the Vánars save.
55494,BOOK VI.(895),"No might but thine, supremely great,"
55495,BOOK VI.(895),May help us in our lost estate.
55496,BOOK VI.(895),"The trembling bears and Vánars cheer,"
55497,BOOK VI.(895),"Calm their sad hearts, dispel their fear."
55498,BOOK VI.(895),"Save Raghu's noble sons, and heal"
55499,BOOK VI.(895),The deep wounds of the winged steel.
55500,BOOK VI.(895),High o'er the waters of the sea
55501,BOOK VI.(895),To far Himálaya's summits flee.
55502,BOOK VI.(895),"Kailása there wilt thou behold,"
55503,BOOK VI.(895),"And Rishabh, with his peaks of gold."
55504,BOOK VI.(895),Between them see a mountain rise
55505,BOOK VI.(895),Whose splendour will enchant thine eyes;
55506,BOOK VI.(895),"His sides are clothed above, below,"
55507,BOOK VI.(895),With all the rarest herbs that grow.
55508,BOOK VI.(895),Upon that mountain's lofty crest
55509,BOOK VI.(895),"Four plants, of sovereign powers possessed,"
55510,BOOK VI.(895),"Spring from the soil, and flashing there"
55511,BOOK VI.(895),Shed radiance through the neighbouring air.
55512,BOOK VI.(895),One draws the shaft: one brings again
55513,BOOK VI.(895),The breath of life to warm the slain;
55514,BOOK VI.(895),One heals each wound; one gives anew
55515,BOOK VI.(895),To faded cheeks their wonted hue.
55516,BOOK VI.(895),"Fly, chieftain, to that mountain's brow"
55517,BOOK VI.(895),"And bring those herbs to save us now."""
55518,BOOK VI.(895),
55519,BOOK VI.(895),"Hanúmán heard, and springing through"
55520,BOOK VI.(895),The air like Vishnu's discus(991) flew.
55521,BOOK VI.(895),"The sea was passed: beneath him, gay"
55522,BOOK VI.(895),"With bright-winged birds, the mountains lay,"
55523,BOOK VI.(895),"And brook and lake and lonely glen,"
55524,BOOK VI.(895),And fertile lands with toiling men.
55525,BOOK VI.(895),"On, on he sped: before him rose"
55526,BOOK VI.(895),The mansion of perennial snows.
55527,BOOK VI.(895),There soared the glorious peaks as fair
55528,BOOK VI.(895),As white clouds in the summer air.
55529,BOOK VI.(895),"Here, bursting from the leafy shade,"
55530,BOOK VI.(895),In thunder leapt the wild cascade.
55531,BOOK VI.(895),He looked on many a pure retreat
55532,BOOK VI.(895),Dear to the Gods' and sages' feet:
55533,BOOK VI.(895),"The spot where Brahmá dwells apart,"
55534,BOOK VI.(895),The place whence Rudra launched his dart;(992)
55535,BOOK VI.(895),"Vishnu's high seat and Indra's home,"
55536,BOOK VI.(895),And slopes where Yáma's servants roam.
55537,BOOK VI.(895),There was Kuvera's bright abode;
55538,BOOK VI.(895),There Brahmá's mystic weapon glowed.
55539,BOOK VI.(895),There was the noble hill whereon
55540,BOOK VI.(895),"Those herbs with wondrous lustre shone,"
55541,BOOK VI.(895),"And, ravished by the glorious sight,"
55542,BOOK VI.(895),Hanúmán rested on the height.
55543,BOOK VI.(895),"He, moving down the glittering peak,"
55544,BOOK VI.(895),The healing herbs began to seek:
55545,BOOK VI.(895),"But, when he thought to seize the prize,"
55546,BOOK VI.(895),They hid them from his eager eyes.
55547,BOOK VI.(895),Then to the hill in wrath he spake:
55548,BOOK VI.(895),"""Mine arm this day shall vengeance take,"
55549,BOOK VI.(895),"If thou wilt feel no pity, none,"
55550,BOOK VI.(895),"In this great need of Raghu's son."""
55551,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: his mighty arms he bent
55552,BOOK VI.(895),And from the trembling mountain rent
55553,BOOK VI.(895),"His huge head with the life it bore,"
55554,BOOK VI.(895),"Snakes, elephants, and golden ore."
55555,BOOK VI.(895),O'er hill and plain and watery waste
55556,BOOK VI.(895),His rapid way again he traced.
55557,BOOK VI.(895),And mid the wondering Vánars laid
55558,BOOK VI.(895),"His burthen through the air conveyed,"
55559,BOOK VI.(895),The wondrous herbs' delightful scent
55560,BOOK VI.(895),To all the host new vigour lent.
55561,BOOK VI.(895),Free from all darts and wounds and pain
55562,BOOK VI.(895),"The sons of Raghu lived again,"
55563,BOOK VI.(895),And dead and dying Vánars healed
55564,BOOK VI.(895),Rose vigorous from the battle field.

55574,BOOK VI.(895),"For now, of sons and brothers reft,"
55575,BOOK VI.(895),To Rávan little hope is left:
55576,BOOK VI.(895),And if our host his gates assail
55577,BOOK VI.(895),"His weak defence will surely fail."""
55578,BOOK VI.(895),
55579,BOOK VI.(895),At dead of night the Vánar bands
55580,BOOK VI.(895),Rushed on with torches in their hands.
55581,BOOK VI.(895),Scared by the coming of the host
55582,BOOK VI.(895),Each giant warder left his post.
55583,BOOK VI.(895),Where'er the Vánar legions came
55584,BOOK VI.(895),Their way was marked with hostile flame
55585,BOOK VI.(895),That spread in fury to devour
55586,BOOK VI.(895),"Palace and temple, gate and tower."
55587,BOOK VI.(895),"Down came the walls and porches, down"
55588,BOOK VI.(895),Came stately piles that graced the town.
55589,BOOK VI.(895),"In many a house the fire was red,"
55590,BOOK VI.(895),On sandal wood and aloe fed.
55591,BOOK VI.(895),And scorching flames in billows rolled
55592,BOOK VI.(895),O'er diamonds and pearls and gold.
55593,BOOK VI.(895),"On cloth of wool, on silk brocade,"
55594,BOOK VI.(895),On linen robes their fury preyed.
55595,BOOK VI.(895),"Wheels, poles and yokes were burned, and all"
55596,BOOK VI.(895),The coursers' harness in the stall;
55597,BOOK VI.(895),"And elephants' and chariots' gear,"
55598,BOOK VI.(895),"The sword, the buckler, and the spear."
55599,BOOK VI.(895),"Scared by the crash of falling beams,"
55600,BOOK VI.(895),"Mid lamentations, groans and screams,"
55601,BOOK VI.(895),Forth rushed the giants through the flames
55602,BOOK VI.(895),"And with them dragged bewildered dames,"
55603,BOOK VI.(895),"Each, with o'erwhelming terror wild,"
55604,BOOK VI.(895),Still clasping to her breast a child.
55605,BOOK VI.(895),The swift fire from a cloud of smoke
55606,BOOK VI.(895),"Through many a gilded lattice broke,"
55607,BOOK VI.(895),"And, melting pearl and coral, rose"
55608,BOOK VI.(895),O'er balconies and porticoes.
55609,BOOK VI.(895),The startled crane and peacock screamed
55610,BOOK VI.(895),"As with strange light the courtyard gleamed,"
55611,BOOK VI.(895),And fierce unusual glare was thrown
55612,BOOK VI.(895),On shrinking wood and heated stone.
55613,BOOK VI.(895),From burning stall and stable freed
55614,BOOK VI.(895),"Rushed frantic elephant and steed,"
55615,BOOK VI.(895),And goaded by the driving blaze
55616,BOOK VI.(895),Fled wildly through the crowded ways.
55617,BOOK VI.(895),As earth with fervent heat will glow
55618,BOOK VI.(895),When comes her final overthrow;
55619,BOOK VI.(895),"From gate to gate, from court to spire"
55620,BOOK VI.(895),"Proud Lanká was one blaze of fire,"
55621,BOOK VI.(895),"And every headland, rock and bay"
55622,BOOK VI.(895),Shone bright a hundred leagues away.
55623,BOOK VI.(895),"Forth, blinded by the heat and flame"
55624,BOOK VI.(895),Ran countless giants huge of frame;
55625,BOOK VI.(895),"And, mustering for fierce attack,"
55626,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánars charged to drive them back,"
55627,BOOK VI.(895),While shout and scream and roar and cry
55628,BOOK VI.(895),Reëchoed through the earth and sky.
55629,BOOK VI.(895),"There Ráma stood with strength renewed,"
55630,BOOK VI.(895),"And ever, as the foe he viewed,"
55631,BOOK VI.(895),Shaking the distant regions rang
55632,BOOK VI.(895),His mighty bow's tremendous clang.
55633,BOOK VI.(895),"Then through the gates Nikumbha hied,"
55634,BOOK VI.(895),"And Kumbha by his brother's side,"
55635,BOOK VI.(895),Sent forth--the bravest and the best--
55636,BOOK VI.(895),To battle by the king's behest.
55637,BOOK VI.(895),"There fought the chiefs in open field,"
55638,BOOK VI.(895),And Angad fell and Dwivid reeled.
55639,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva saw: by rage impelled
55640,BOOK VI.(895),He crushed the bow which Kumbha held.
55641,BOOK VI.(895),About his foe Sugríva wound
55642,BOOK VI.(895),"His arms, and, heaving from the ground"
55643,BOOK VI.(895),The giant hurled him o'er the bank;
55644,BOOK VI.(895),And deep beneath the sea he sank.
55645,BOOK VI.(895),Like mandar hill with furious swell
55646,BOOK VI.(895),Up leapt the waters where he fell.
55647,BOOK VI.(895),Again he rose: he sprang to land
55648,BOOK VI.(895),And raised on high his threatening hand:
55649,BOOK VI.(895),Full on Sugríva's chest it came
55650,BOOK VI.(895),"And shook the Vánar's massy frame,"
55651,BOOK VI.(895),But on the wounded bone he broke
55652,BOOK VI.(895),His wrist--so furious was the stroke.
55653,BOOK VI.(895),"With force that naught could stay or check,"
55654,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva smote him neath the neck.
55655,BOOK VI.(895),The fierce blow crashed through flesh and bone
55656,BOOK VI.(895),And Kumbha lay in death o'erthrown.
55657,BOOK VI.(895),"Nikumbha saw his brother die,"
55658,BOOK VI.(895),And red with fury flashed his eye.
55659,BOOK VI.(895),He dashed with mighty sway and swing
55660,BOOK VI.(895),His axe against the Vánar king;
55661,BOOK VI.(895),But shattered on that living rock
55662,BOOK VI.(895),It split in fragments at the shock.
55663,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva, rising to the blow,"
55664,BOOK VI.(895),Raised his huge hand and smote his foe.
55665,BOOK VI.(895),And in the dust the giant lay
55666,BOOK VI.(895),Gasping in blood his soul away.
55667,BOOK VI.(895),
55668,BOOK VI.(895),"[I have briefly despatched Kumbha and Nikumbha, each of whom has in the"

55674,BOOK VI.(895),rendered invisible by his magic art slays countless Vánars with his

55676,BOOK VI.(895),"an effigy of Sítá, the work of magic, weeping and wailing by his side. He"
55677,BOOK VI.(895),grasps the lovely image by the hair and cuts it down with his scimitar in

55679,BOOK VI.(895),"much fighting of the usual kind Indrajít's chariot is broken in pieces,"

55705,BOOK VI.(895),"""Ah me, my son, my pride: the boast"
55706,BOOK VI.(895),And glory of the giant host.
55707,BOOK VI.(895),Could Lakshman's puny might defeat
55708,BOOK VI.(895),The foe whom Indra feared to meet?
55709,BOOK VI.(895),Could not thy deadly arrows split
55710,BOOK VI.(895),"Proud Mandar's peaks, O Indrajít,"
55711,BOOK VI.(895),And the Destroyer's self destroy?
55712,BOOK VI.(895),And wast thou conquered by a boy?
55713,BOOK VI.(895),I will not weep: thy noble deed
55714,BOOK VI.(895),Has blessed thee with immortal meed
55715,BOOK VI.(895),Gained by each hero in the skies
55716,BOOK VI.(895),Who fighting for his sovereign dies.
55717,BOOK VI.(895),"Now, fearless of all meaner foes,"
55718,BOOK VI.(895),The guardian Gods(993) will taste repose:
55719,BOOK VI.(895),"But earth to me, with hill and plain,"
55720,BOOK VI.(895),"Is desolate, for thou art slain."
55721,BOOK VI.(895),"Ah, whither hast thou fled, and left"
55722,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy mother, Lanká, me bereft;"
55723,BOOK VI.(895),"Left pride and state and wives behind,"
55724,BOOK VI.(895),And lordship over all thy kind?
55725,BOOK VI.(895),I fondly hoped thy hand should pay
55726,BOOK VI.(895),Due honours on my dying day:
55727,BOOK VI.(895),"And couldst thou, O beloved, flee"
55728,BOOK VI.(895),And leave thy funeral rites to me?
55729,BOOK VI.(895),"Life has no comfort left me, none,"
55730,BOOK VI.(895),"O Indrajít my son, my son."""
55731,BOOK VI.(895),
55732,BOOK VI.(895),Thus wailed he broken by his woes:
55733,BOOK VI.(895),But swift the thought of vengeance rose.
55734,BOOK VI.(895),"In awful wrath his teeth he gnashed,"
55735,BOOK VI.(895),And from his eyes red lightning flashed.
55736,BOOK VI.(895),"Hot from his mouth came fire and smoke,"
55737,BOOK VI.(895),As thus the king in fury spoke:
55738,BOOK VI.(895),
55739,BOOK VI.(895),"""Through many a thousand years of yore"
55740,BOOK VI.(895),"The penance and the pain I bore,"
55741,BOOK VI.(895),And by fierce torment well sustained
55742,BOOK VI.(895),"The highest grace of Brahmá gained,"
55743,BOOK VI.(895),"His plighted word my life assured,"
55744,BOOK VI.(895),From Gods of heaven and fiends secured.
55745,BOOK VI.(895),He armed my limbs with burnished mail
55746,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose lustre turns the sunbeams pale,"
55747,BOOK VI.(895),In battle proof gainst heavenly bands
55748,BOOK VI.(895),With thunder in their threatening hands.
55749,BOOK VI.(895),Armed in this mail myself will go
55750,BOOK VI.(895),"With Brahmá's gift my deadly bow,"
55751,BOOK VI.(895),"And, cleaving through the foes my way,"
55752,BOOK VI.(895),"The slayers of my son will slay."""
55753,BOOK VI.(895),
55754,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, by his grief to frenzy wrought,"
55755,BOOK VI.(895),The captive in the grove he sought.
55756,BOOK VI.(895),Swift through the shady path he sped:
55757,BOOK VI.(895),Earth trembled at his furious tread.
55758,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce were his eyes: his monstrous hand
55759,BOOK VI.(895),Held drawn for death his glittering brand.
55760,BOOK VI.(895),There weeping stood the Maithil dame:
55761,BOOK VI.(895),She shuddered as the giant came.
55762,BOOK VI.(895),Near drew the rover of the night
55763,BOOK VI.(895),And raised his sword in act to smite;
55764,BOOK VI.(895),"But, by his nobler heart impelled,"
55765,BOOK VI.(895),One Rákshas lord his arm withheld:
55766,BOOK VI.(895),"""Wilt thou, great Monarch,"" thus he cried,"
55767,BOOK VI.(895),"""Wilt thou, to heavenly Gods allied,"

55771,BOOK VI.(895),"To stain thee with eternal guilt,"
55772,BOOK VI.(895),Thee deep in all the Veda's lore?

55776,BOOK VI.(895),
55777,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: the prudent counsel pleased
55778,BOOK VI.(895),"The monarch, and his wrath appeased;"
55779,BOOK VI.(895),Then to his council hall in haste
55780,BOOK VI.(895),The giant lord his steps retraced.

55796,BOOK VI.(895),The voice of weeping and lament.
55797,BOOK VI.(895),"In troubled thought his head he bowed,"
55798,BOOK VI.(895),Then fiercely loosing on the crowd

55854,BOOK VI.(895),He came: his clanging bow he drew
55855,BOOK VI.(895),And myriads of the Vánars slew.
55856,BOOK VI.(895),"Some through the side and heart he cleft,"

55899,BOOK VI.(895),Fast rained his shafts: where'er he sped
55900,BOOK VI.(895),"The conquered Vánars fell or fled,"
55901,BOOK VI.(895),On rolled the car in swift career
55902,BOOK VI.(895),Till Raghu's noble sons were near.
55903,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma looked upon the foe
55904,BOOK VI.(895),"And strained and tried his sounding bow,"
55905,BOOK VI.(895),Till earth and all the region rang
55906,BOOK VI.(895),Re-echoing to the awful clang.
55907,BOOK VI.(895),"His bow the younger chieftain bent,"
55908,BOOK VI.(895),And shaft on shaft at Rávan sent.

55911,BOOK VI.(895),"And headless, baffled of its aim,"
55912,BOOK VI.(895),To earth the harmless missile came;
55913,BOOK VI.(895),And Lakshman stayed his arm o'erpowered

55915,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce waxed the fight and fiercer yet,"
55916,BOOK VI.(895),"For Rávan now and Ráma met,"
55917,BOOK VI.(895),And each on other poured amain
55918,BOOK VI.(895),The tempest of his arrowy rain.
55919,BOOK VI.(895),While all the sky above was dark
55920,BOOK VI.(895),With missiles speeding to their mark

55932,BOOK VI.(895),That crown of shafts though wounded sore.

55981,BOOK VI.(895),The steeds that Rávan's chariot drew.

55984,BOOK VI.(895),"But Ráma's arrows checked its way,"
55985,BOOK VI.(895),"And harmless on the earth it lay,"
55986,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant seized a mightier spear,"

56008,BOOK VI.(895),And thoughts of vengeance filled his breast.
56009,BOOK VI.(895),The air around him flashed and gleamed

56044,BOOK VI.(895),Were not thy steps beside me still
56045,BOOK VI.(895),"In gloomy wood, on breezy hill?"
56046,BOOK VI.(895),Did not thy gentle care assuage
56047,BOOK VI.(895),Thy brother's grief and fitful rage?

56050,BOOK VI.(895),
56051,BOOK VI.(895),"As Ráma, vanquished, wept and sighed"
56052,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar chieftain thus replied:
56053,BOOK VI.(895),"""Great Prince, unmanly thoughts dismiss,"
56054,BOOK VI.(895),Nor yield thy soul to grief like this.
56055,BOOK VI.(895),In vain those burning tears are shed:
56056,BOOK VI.(895),Our glory Lakshman is not dead.
56057,BOOK VI.(895),"Death on his brow no mark has set,"
56058,BOOK VI.(895),Where beauty's lustre lingers yet.
56059,BOOK VI.(895),"Clear is the skin, and tender hues"
56060,BOOK VI.(895),Of lotus flowers his palms suffuse.
56061,BOOK VI.(895),"O Ráma, cheer thy trembling heart;"
56062,BOOK VI.(895),Not thus do life and body part.
56063,BOOK VI.(895),"Now, Hanumán, to thee I speak:"
56064,BOOK VI.(895),Hie hence to tall Mahodaya's(996) peak

56066,BOOK VI.(895),Which life and health and strength bestow

56068,BOOK VI.(895),"And Lakshman shall be well again."""
56069,BOOK VI.(895),
56070,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: the Wind-God's son obeyed
56071,BOOK VI.(895),Swift through the clouds his way he made.
56072,BOOK VI.(895),"He reached the hill, nor stayed to find"
56073,BOOK VI.(895),"The wondrous herbs of healing kind,"
56074,BOOK VI.(895),From its broad base the mount he tore
56075,BOOK VI.(895),"With all the shrubs and trees it bore,"
56076,BOOK VI.(895),Sped through the clouds again and showed
56077,BOOK VI.(895),To wise Sushen his woody load.(997)
56078,BOOK VI.(895),"Sushen in wonder viewed the hill,"
56079,BOOK VI.(895),And culled the sovereign salve of ill.
56080,BOOK VI.(895),"Soon as the healing herb he found,"
56081,BOOK VI.(895),The fragrant leaves he crushed and ground.
56082,BOOK VI.(895),"Then over Lakshman's face he bent,"
56083,BOOK VI.(895),"Who, healed and strengthened by the scent"
56084,BOOK VI.(895),"Of that blest herb divinely sweet,"
56085,BOOK VI.(895),Rose fresh and lusty on his feet.

56093,BOOK VI.(895),Then Raghu's son forgot his woe:
56094,BOOK VI.(895),Again he grasped his fallen bow
56095,BOOK VI.(895),And hurled at Lanká's lord amain
56096,BOOK VI.(895),The tempest of his arrowy rain.
56097,BOOK VI.(895),"Drawn by the steeds his lords had brought,"
56098,BOOK VI.(895),Again the giant turned and fought.
56099,BOOK VI.(895),And drove his glittering chariot nigh
56100,BOOK VI.(895),As springs the Day-God through the sky.
56101,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, as his sounding bow he bent,"
56102,BOOK VI.(895),"Like thunderbolts his shafts were sent,"
56103,BOOK VI.(895),As when dark clouds in rain time shed
56104,BOOK VI.(895),Fierce torrents on a mountain's head.
56105,BOOK VI.(895),"High on his car the giant rode,"
56106,BOOK VI.(895),On foot the son of Raghu strode.
56107,BOOK VI.(895),The Gods from their celestial height
56108,BOOK VI.(895),Indignant saw the unequal fight.
56109,BOOK VI.(895),"Then he whom heavenly hosts revere,"
56110,BOOK VI.(895),"Lord Indra, called his charioteer:"
56111,BOOK VI.(895),
56112,BOOK VI.(895),"""Haste, Mátali,"" he cried, ""descend;"

56115,BOOK VI.(895),"And all the Gods thy deed will bless."""
56116,BOOK VI.(895),
56117,BOOK VI.(895),He bowed; he brought the glorious car
56118,BOOK VI.(895),Whose tinkling bells were heard afar;
56119,BOOK VI.(895),"Fair as the sun of morning, bright"
56120,BOOK VI.(895),With gold and pearl and lazulite.
56121,BOOK VI.(895),He yoked the steeds of tawny hue
56122,BOOK VI.(895),That swifter than the tempest flew.
56123,BOOK VI.(895),Then down the slope of heaven he hied
56124,BOOK VI.(895),And stayed the car by Ráma's side.
56125,BOOK VI.(895),"""Ascend, O Chief,"" he humbly cried,"
56126,BOOK VI.(895),"""The chariot which the Gods provide."
56127,BOOK VI.(895),"The mighty bow of Indra see,"

56131,BOOK VI.(895),
56132,BOOK VI.(895),Cheered by the grace the Immortals showed
56133,BOOK VI.(895),The chieftain on the chariot rode.
56134,BOOK VI.(895),Then as the car-borne warriors met
56135,BOOK VI.(895),The awful fight raged fiercer yet.
56136,BOOK VI.(895),Each shaft that Rávan shot became
56137,BOOK VI.(895),"A serpent red with kindled flame,"
56138,BOOK VI.(895),And round the limbs of Ráma hung
56139,BOOK VI.(895),With fiery jaws and quivering tongue.
56140,BOOK VI.(895),But every serpent fled dismayed
56141,BOOK VI.(895),When Raghu's valiant son displayed
56142,BOOK VI.(895),"The weapon of the Feathered King,(998)"
56143,BOOK VI.(895),And loosed his arrows from the string.
56144,BOOK VI.(895),"But Rávan armed his bow anew,"
56145,BOOK VI.(895),"And showers of shafts at Ráma flew,"
56146,BOOK VI.(895),While the fierce king in swift career
56147,BOOK VI.(895),Smote with a dart the charioteer.
56148,BOOK VI.(895),An arrow shot by Rávan's hand
56149,BOOK VI.(895),"Laid the proud banner on the sand,"
56150,BOOK VI.(895),And Indra's steeds of heavenly strain
56151,BOOK VI.(895),Fell by the iron tempest slain.
56152,BOOK VI.(895),On Gods and spirits of the air
56153,BOOK VI.(895),"Fell terror, trembling, and despair."
56154,BOOK VI.(895),The sea's white billows mounted high
56155,BOOK VI.(895),With froth and foam to drench the sky.
56156,BOOK VI.(895),"The sun by lurid clouds was veiled,"
56157,BOOK VI.(895),The friendly lights of heaven were paled;
56158,BOOK VI.(895),"And, fiercely gleaming, fiery Mars"
56159,BOOK VI.(895),Opposed the beams of gentler stars.
56160,BOOK VI.(895),
56161,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma's eyes with fury blazed
56162,BOOK VI.(895),As Indra's heavenly spear he raised.
56163,BOOK VI.(895),Loud rang the bells: the glistering head
56164,BOOK VI.(895),Bright flashes through the region shed.
56165,BOOK VI.(895),Down came the spear in swift descent:
56166,BOOK VI.(895),The giant's lance was crushed and bent.
56167,BOOK VI.(895),Then Rávan's horses brave and fleet
56168,BOOK VI.(895),Fell dead beneath his arrowy sleet.
56169,BOOK VI.(895),"Fierce on his foeman Ráma pressed,"
56170,BOOK VI.(895),And gored with shafts his mighty breast.
56171,BOOK VI.(895),And spouting streams of crimson dyed

56263,BOOK VI.(895),Urged onward by his charioteer
56264,BOOK VI.(895),"The giant's foaming steeds came near,"
56265,BOOK VI.(895),And furious was the battle's din
56266,BOOK VI.(895),Where each resolved to die or win.
56267,BOOK VI.(895),The Rákshas host and Vánar bands
56268,BOOK VI.(895),"Stood with their weapons in their hands,"
56269,BOOK VI.(895),And watched in terror and dismay

56273,BOOK VI.(895),But when they touched the chariot made
56274,BOOK VI.(895),By heavenly hands their force was stayed.
56275,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma's breast with fury swelled;
56276,BOOK VI.(895),"He strained the mighty bow he held,"
56277,BOOK VI.(895),And straight at Rávan's banner flew
56278,BOOK VI.(895),An arrow as the string he drew--
56279,BOOK VI.(895),"A deadly arrow swift of flight,"

56285,BOOK VI.(895),Unmoved the heavenly steeds sustained

56288,BOOK VI.(895),Each haughty crest and glossy coat.
56289,BOOK VI.(895),"Then volleyed swift by magic art,"
56290,BOOK VI.(895),"Tree, mountain peak and spear and dart,"
56291,BOOK VI.(895),Trident and pike and club and mace

56306,BOOK VI.(895),"Each at his foe his chariot drove,"
56307,BOOK VI.(895),And still for death or victory strove.
56308,BOOK VI.(895),"The warriors' steeds together dashed,"
56309,BOOK VI.(895),And pole with pole reëchoing clashed.
56310,BOOK VI.(895),Then Ráma launching dart on dart
56311,BOOK VI.(895),Made Rávan's coursers swerve and start.
56312,BOOK VI.(895),Nor was the lord of Lanká slow
56313,BOOK VI.(895),"To rain his arrows on the foe,"

56315,BOOK VI.(895),"No trace of pain, nor shook nor quailed."
56316,BOOK VI.(895),Dense clouds of arrows Ráma shot
56317,BOOK VI.(895),"With that strong arm which rested not,"
56318,BOOK VI.(895),And spear and mace and club and brand
56319,BOOK VI.(895),Fell in dire rain from Rávan's hand.
56320,BOOK VI.(895),The storm of missiles fiercely cast
56321,BOOK VI.(895),"Stirred up the oceans with its blast,"
56322,BOOK VI.(895),And Serpent-Gods and fiends who dwell
56323,BOOK VI.(895),Below were troubled by the swell.
56324,BOOK VI.(895),The earth with hill and plain and brook
56325,BOOK VI.(895),And grove and garden reeled and shook:
56326,BOOK VI.(895),"The very sun grew cold and pale,"
56327,BOOK VI.(895),And horror stilled the rising gale.
56328,BOOK VI.(895),"God and Gandharva, sage and saint"

56335,BOOK VI.(895),Then to his deadly string the pride
56336,BOOK VI.(895),Of Raghu's race a shaft applied.
56337,BOOK VI.(895),Sharp as a serpent's venomed fang
56338,BOOK VI.(895),"Straight to its mark the arrow sprang,"
56339,BOOK VI.(895),And from the giant's body shred

56341,BOOK VI.(895),There might the triple world behold
56342,BOOK VI.(895),That severed head adorned with gold.
56343,BOOK VI.(895),"But when all eyes were bent to view,"
56344,BOOK VI.(895),Swift in its stead another grew.
56345,BOOK VI.(895),Again the shaft was pointed well:
56346,BOOK VI.(895),Again the head divided fell;
56347,BOOK VI.(895),But still as each to earth was cast
56348,BOOK VI.(895),Another head succeeded fast.
56349,BOOK VI.(895),"A hundred, bright with fiery flame,"
56350,BOOK VI.(895),"Fell low before the victor's aim,"
56351,BOOK VI.(895),Yet Rávan by no sign betrayed
56352,BOOK VI.(895),That death was near or strength decayed.
56353,BOOK VI.(895),"The doubtful fight he still maintained,"
56354,BOOK VI.(895),And on the foe his missiles rained.
56355,BOOK VI.(895),"In air, on earth, on plain, on hill,"
56356,BOOK VI.(895),With awful might he battled still;

56371,BOOK VI.(895),"Was kindled by the Almighty Sire."""
56372,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: and Raghu's son obeyed:

56403,BOOK VI.(895),"Brought odours from the heavenly trees,"
56404,BOOK VI.(895),And ravishing the sight and smell

56416,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could his heart its woe contain.
56417,BOOK VI.(895),O'er the dead king he sadly bent
56418,BOOK VI.(895),And mourned him with a loud lament:
56419,BOOK VI.(895),"""O hero, bold and brave,"" he cried,"
56420,BOOK VI.(895),"""Skilled in all arms, in battle tried."
56421,BOOK VI.(895),"Spoiled of thy crown, with limbs outspread,"

56425,BOOK VI.(895),"Ah me, my brother over bold,"
56426,BOOK VI.(895),Thine is the fate my heart foretold:
56427,BOOK VI.(895),But love and pride forbade to hear

56431,BOOK VI.(895),Our beacon fire is dead and cold
56432,BOOK VI.(895),A hundred waves have o'er it rolled.

56615,BOOK VI.(895),"Behind, their cheeks with tears bedewed,"
56616,BOOK VI.(895),Came sad the widowed multitude.

56618,BOOK VI.(895),"Piled sandal logs, and scented wood,"
56619,BOOK VI.(895),The body of the king was set
56620,BOOK VI.(895),High on a deerskin coverlet.

56623,BOOK VI.(895),And southward on the eastern side
56624,BOOK VI.(895),An altar formed and fire supplied.
56625,BOOK VI.(895),Then on the shoulder of the dead
56626,BOOK VI.(895),The oil and clotted milk were shed.
56627,BOOK VI.(895),All rites were done as rules ordain:
56628,BOOK VI.(895),The sacrificial goat was slain.
56629,BOOK VI.(895),Next on the corpse were perfumes thrown
56630,BOOK VI.(895),And many a flowery wreath was strown;
56631,BOOK VI.(895),And with Vibhishan's ready aid
56632,BOOK VI.(895),Rich vesture o'er the king was laid.
56633,BOOK VI.(895),Then while the tears their cheeks bedewed

56682,BOOK VI.(895),Sea water for the giants' king.
56683,BOOK VI.(895),The brimming urn was swiftly brought:
56684,BOOK VI.(895),Then on a throne superbly wrought

56727,BOOK VI.(895),To keep the mighty oath I swore.
56728,BOOK VI.(895),"Now, gentle love, thy cares dispel,"
56729,BOOK VI.(895),"And weep no more, for all is well."
56730,BOOK VI.(895),Fear not in Rávan's house to stay
56731,BOOK VI.(895),"For good Vibhishan now bears sway,"
56732,BOOK VI.(895),For constant truth and friendship known
56733,BOOK VI.(895),"Regard his palace as thine own."""
56734,BOOK VI.(895),"He greets thee thus thy heart to cheer,"
56735,BOOK VI.(895),"And urged by love will soon be here."""
56736,BOOK VI.(895),
56737,BOOK VI.(895),Then flushed with joy the lady's cheek.
56738,BOOK VI.(895),"Her eyes o'erflowed, her voice was weak;"
56739,BOOK VI.(895),But struggling with her sobs she broke
56740,BOOK VI.(895),"Her silence thus, and faintly spoke:"
56741,BOOK VI.(895),"""So fast the flood of rapture came,"
56742,BOOK VI.(895),My trembling tongue no words could frame.
56743,BOOK VI.(895),Ne'er have I heard in days of bliss
56744,BOOK VI.(895),A tale that gave such joy as this.
56745,BOOK VI.(895),More precious far than gems and gold
56746,BOOK VI.(895),"The message which thy lips have told."""
56747,BOOK VI.(895),
56748,BOOK VI.(895),His reverent hands the Vánar raised
56749,BOOK VI.(895),And thus the lady's answer praised:
56750,BOOK VI.(895),"""Sweet are the words, O Queen, which thou"
56751,BOOK VI.(895),"True to thy lord, hast spoken now,"
56752,BOOK VI.(895),"Better than gems and pearls of price,"
56753,BOOK VI.(895),"Yea, or the throne of Paradise."
56754,BOOK VI.(895),"But, lady, ere I leave this place,"
56755,BOOK VI.(895),"Grant me, I pray, a single grace."
56756,BOOK VI.(895),"Permit me, and this vengeful hand"
56757,BOOK VI.(895),"Shall slay thy guards, this Rákshas band,"
56758,BOOK VI.(895),Whose cruel insult threat and scorn
56759,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy gentle soul too long has borne."""
56760,BOOK VI.(895),
56761,BOOK VI.(895),"Thus, stern of mood, Hanúmán cried:"
56762,BOOK VI.(895),The Maithil lady thus replied:
56763,BOOK VI.(895),"""Nay, be not wroth with servants: they,"
56764,BOOK VI.(895),When monarchs bid must needs obey.
56765,BOOK VI.(895),"And, vassals of their lords, fulfil"
56766,BOOK VI.(895),Each fancy of their sovereign will.
56767,BOOK VI.(895),"To mine own sins the blame impute,"
56768,BOOK VI.(895),For as we sow we reap the fruit.
56769,BOOK VI.(895),The tyrant's will these dames obeyed
56770,BOOK VI.(895),"When their fierce threats my soul dismayed."""
56771,BOOK VI.(895),
56772,BOOK VI.(895),She ceased: with admiration moved
56773,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar chief her words approved:
56774,BOOK VI.(895),"""Thy speech,"" he cried, ""is worthy one"
56775,BOOK VI.(895),Whom love has linked to Raghu's son.
56776,BOOK VI.(895),"Now speak, O Queen, that I may know"
56777,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy pleasure, for to him I go."""
56778,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar ceased: then Janak's child
56779,BOOK VI.(895),Made answer as she sweetly smiled:
56780,BOOK VI.(895),"""'My first, my only wish can be,"
56781,BOOK VI.(895),"O chief, my loving lord to see."""
56782,BOOK VI.(895),"Again the Vánar envoy spoke,"
56783,BOOK VI.(895),And with his words new rapture woke:
56784,BOOK VI.(895),"""Queen, ere this sun shall cease to shine"
56785,BOOK VI.(895),Thy Ráma's eyes shall look in thine.
56786,BOOK VI.(895),Again the lord of Raghu's race
56787,BOOK VI.(895),Shall turn to thee his moon-bright face.
56788,BOOK VI.(895),His faithful brother shall thou see
56789,BOOK VI.(895),"And every friend who fought for thee,"
56790,BOOK VI.(895),And greet once more thy king restored
56791,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Sachí(1014) to her heavenly lord."""
56792,BOOK VI.(895),To Raghu's son his steps he bent
56793,BOOK VI.(895),And told the message that she sent.
56794,BOOK VI.(895),

56799,BOOK VI.(895),
56800,BOOK VI.(895),
56801,BOOK VI.(895),He looked upon that archer chief
56802,BOOK VI.(895),"Whose full eye mocked the lotus leaf,"
56803,BOOK VI.(895),And thus the noble Vánar spake:
56804,BOOK VI.(895),"""Now meet the queen for whose dear sake"
56805,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy mighty task was first begun,"
56806,BOOK VI.(895),And now the glorious fruit is won.
56807,BOOK VI.(895),"O'erwhelmed with woe thy lady lies,"
56808,BOOK VI.(895),The hot tears streaming from her eyes.
56809,BOOK VI.(895),And still the queen must long and pine
56810,BOOK VI.(895),"Until those eyes be turned to thine."""
56811,BOOK VI.(895),
56812,BOOK VI.(895),"But Ráma stood in pensive mood,"
56813,BOOK VI.(895),And gathering tears his eyes bedewed.
56814,BOOK VI.(895),His sad looks sought the ground: he sighed
56815,BOOK VI.(895),And thus to King Vibhishan cried:
56816,BOOK VI.(895),"""Let Sítá bathe and tire her head"
56817,BOOK VI.(895),And hither to my sight be led
56818,BOOK VI.(895),"In raiment sweet with precious scent,"

56820,BOOK VI.(895),
56821,BOOK VI.(895),"The Rákshas king his palace sought,"
56822,BOOK VI.(895),And Sítá from her bower was brought.
56823,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Rákshas bearers tall and strong,"
56824,BOOK VI.(895),"Selected from the menial throng,"
56825,BOOK VI.(895),"Through Lanká's gate the queen, arrayed"
56826,BOOK VI.(895),"In glorious robes and gems, conveyed."
56827,BOOK VI.(895),"Concealed behind the silken screen,"
56828,BOOK VI.(895),"Swift to the plain they bore the queen,"
56829,BOOK VI.(895),"While Vánars, close on every side,"
56830,BOOK VI.(895),With eager looks the litter eyed.
56831,BOOK VI.(895),The warders at Vibhishan's hest
56832,BOOK VI.(895),"The onward rushing throng repressed,"
56833,BOOK VI.(895),While like the roar of ocean loud
56834,BOOK VI.(895),Rose the wild murmur of the crowd.
56835,BOOK VI.(895),The son of Raghu saw and moved
56836,BOOK VI.(895),With anger thus the king reproved:
56837,BOOK VI.(895),"""Why vex with hasty blow and threat"
56838,BOOK VI.(895),"The Vánars, and my rights forget?"
56839,BOOK VI.(895),"Repress this zeal, untimely shown:"
56840,BOOK VI.(895),I count this people as mine own.
56841,BOOK VI.(895),"A woman's guard is not her bower,"
56842,BOOK VI.(895),"The lofty wall, the fenced tower:"
56843,BOOK VI.(895),"Her conduct is her best defence,"
56844,BOOK VI.(895),And not a king's magnificence.
56845,BOOK VI.(895),"At holy rites, in war and woe,"
56846,BOOK VI.(895),Her face unveiled a dame may show;
56847,BOOK VI.(895),"When at the Maiden's Choice(1015) they meet,"
56848,BOOK VI.(895),When marriage troops parade the street.
56849,BOOK VI.(895),"And she, my queen, who long has lain"
56850,BOOK VI.(895),"In prison racked with care and pain,"
56851,BOOK VI.(895),"May cease a while her face to hide,"
56852,BOOK VI.(895),For is not Ráma by her side?
56853,BOOK VI.(895),Lay down the litter: on her feet
56854,BOOK VI.(895),Let Sítá come her lord to meet.
56855,BOOK VI.(895),And let the hosts of woodland race
56856,BOOK VI.(895),"Look near upon the lady's face."""
56857,BOOK VI.(895),
56858,BOOK VI.(895),Then Lakshman and each Vánar chief
56859,BOOK VI.(895),Who heard his words were filled with grief.
56860,BOOK VI.(895),"The lady's gentle spirit sank,"
56861,BOOK VI.(895),"And from each eye in fear she shrank,"
56862,BOOK VI.(895),"As, her sweet eyelids veiled for shame,"
56863,BOOK VI.(895),Slowly before her lord she came.
56864,BOOK VI.(895),While rapture battled with surprise
56865,BOOK VI.(895),She raised to his her wistful eyes.
56866,BOOK VI.(895),"Then with her doubt and fear she strove,"
56867,BOOK VI.(895),And from her breast all sorrow drove.
56868,BOOK VI.(895),"Regardless of the gathering crowd,"
56869,BOOK VI.(895),"Bright as the moon without a cloud,"
56870,BOOK VI.(895),"She bent her eyes, no longer dim,"

56883,BOOK VI.(895),"This arm my glory has retrieved,"
56884,BOOK VI.(895),And all that man might do achieved;
56885,BOOK VI.(895),The insulting foe in battle slain
56886,BOOK VI.(895),And cleared mine honour from its stain.
56887,BOOK VI.(895),This day has made my name renowned
56888,BOOK VI.(895),And with success my labour crowned.
56889,BOOK VI.(895),"Lord of myself, the oath I swore"

56894,BOOK VI.(895),The blot that on mine honour lay.
56895,BOOK VI.(895),"The bridge that spans the foaming flood,"
56896,BOOK VI.(895),The city red with giants' blood;

56905,BOOK VI.(895),No fond affection for my wife
56906,BOOK VI.(895),Inspired me in the hour of strife.
56907,BOOK VI.(895),I battled to avenge the cause
56908,BOOK VI.(895),Of honour and insulted laws.
56909,BOOK VI.(895),"My love is fled, for on thy fame"
56910,BOOK VI.(895),Lies the dark blot of sin and shame;

56932,BOOK VI.(895),Struck down with overwhelming shame
56933,BOOK VI.(895),She shrank within her trembling frame.
56934,BOOK VI.(895),Each word of Ráma's like a dart

56995,BOOK VI.(895),"She slowly paced around her lord,"
56996,BOOK VI.(895),"The Gods with reverent act adored,"
56997,BOOK VI.(895),Then raising suppliant hands the dame

57756,BOOK VI.(895),"The golden deer pursued and shot,"
57757,BOOK VI.(895),And Rávan came and stole away
57758,BOOK VI.(895),"The Maithil queen his hapless prey,"
57759,BOOK VI.(895),"When, as he fought, the dame to save,"
57760,BOOK VI.(895),His noble life Jatáyus gave:
57761,BOOK VI.(895),"How Ráma still the the search renewed,"
57762,BOOK VI.(895),"The robber to his hold pursued,"
57763,BOOK VI.(895),"Bridging the sea from shore to shore,"
57764,BOOK VI.(895),And found his queen to part no more.(1025)

57770,BOOK VI.(895),
57771,BOOK VI.(895),
57772,BOOK VI.(895),O'erwhelmed with rapture Bharat heard
57773,BOOK VI.(895),"The tale that all his being stirred,"
57774,BOOK VI.(895),"And, heralding the glad event,"
57775,BOOK VI.(895),This order to Satrughna sent:
57776,BOOK VI.(895),"""Let every shrine with flowers be gay"
57777,BOOK VI.(895),Let incense burn and music play.
57778,BOOK VI.(895),"Go forth, go forth to meet your king,"
57779,BOOK VI.(895),"Let tabours sound and minstrels sing,"
57780,BOOK VI.(895),Let bards swell high the note of praise
57781,BOOK VI.(895),"Skilled in the lore of ancient days,"
57782,BOOK VI.(895),Call forth the royal matrons: call
57783,BOOK VI.(895),Each noble from the council hall.
57784,BOOK VI.(895),"Send all we love and honour most,"
57785,BOOK VI.(895),"Send Bráhmans and the warrior host,"
57786,BOOK VI.(895),A glorious company to bring
57787,BOOK VI.(895),"In triumph home our lord the king."""
57788,BOOK VI.(895),
57789,BOOK VI.(895),"Great rapture filled Satrughna's breast,"
57790,BOOK VI.(895),Obedient to his brother's hest.
57791,BOOK VI.(895),"""Send forth ten thousand men"" he cried,"
57792,BOOK VI.(895),"""Let brawny arms be stoutly plied,"
57793,BOOK VI.(895),"And, smoothing all with skilful care,"
57794,BOOK VI.(895),The road for Kosal's king prepare.
57795,BOOK VI.(895),Then o'er the earth let thousands throw
57796,BOOK VI.(895),"Fresh showers of water cool as snow,"
57797,BOOK VI.(895),And others strew with garlands gay
57798,BOOK VI.(895),With loveliest blooms our monarch's way.
57799,BOOK VI.(895),On tower and temple porch and gate
57800,BOOK VI.(895),"Let banners wave in royal state,"
57801,BOOK VI.(895),And be each roof and terrace lined
57802,BOOK VI.(895),"With blossoms loose and chaplets twined."""
57803,BOOK VI.(895),
57804,BOOK VI.(895),The nobles hasting forth fulfilled
57805,BOOK VI.(895),His order as Satrughna willed.
57806,BOOK VI.(895),Sublime on elephants they rode
57807,BOOK VI.(895),Whose gilded girths with jewels glowed.
57808,BOOK VI.(895),Attended close by thousands more
57809,BOOK VI.(895),Gay with the gear and flags they bore.
57810,BOOK VI.(895),"A thousand chiefs their steeds bestrode,"
57811,BOOK VI.(895),Their glittering cars a thousand showed.
57812,BOOK VI.(895),And countless hosts in rich array
57813,BOOK VI.(895),Pursued on foot their eager way.
57814,BOOK VI.(895),Veiled from the air with silken screens
57815,BOOK VI.(895),In litters rode the widowed queens.
57816,BOOK VI.(895),"Kausalyá first, acknowledged head"
57817,BOOK VI.(895),"And sovereign of the household, led:"
57818,BOOK VI.(895),"Sumitrá next, and after, dames"
57819,BOOK VI.(895),Of lower rank and humbler names.
57820,BOOK VI.(895),Then compassed by a white-robed throng
57821,BOOK VI.(895),"Of Bráhmans, heralded with song,"
57822,BOOK VI.(895),"With shouts of joy from countless throats,"
57823,BOOK VI.(895),"And shells' and tambours' mingled notes,"
57824,BOOK VI.(895),"And drums resounding long and loud,"
57825,BOOK VI.(895),Exulting Bharat joined the crowd.
57826,BOOK VI.(895),"Still on his head, well-trained in lore"
57827,BOOK VI.(895),"Of duty, Ráma's shoes he bore."
57828,BOOK VI.(895),The moon-white canopy was spread
57829,BOOK VI.(895),"With flowery twine engarlanded,"
57830,BOOK VI.(895),"And jewelled cheuries, meet to hold"
57831,BOOK VI.(895),"O'er Ráma's brow, shone bright with gold,"
57832,BOOK VI.(895),"Though Nandigráma's town they neared,"
57833,BOOK VI.(895),Of Ráma yet no sign appeared.
57834,BOOK VI.(895),Then Bharat called the Vánar chief
57835,BOOK VI.(895),And questioned thus in doubt and grief:
57836,BOOK VI.(895),"""Hast thou uncertain, like thy kind,"
57837,BOOK VI.(895),A sweet delusive guile designed?
57838,BOOK VI.(895),"Where, where is royal Ráma? show"
57839,BOOK VI.(895),"The hero, victor of the foe."
57840,BOOK VI.(895),"I gaze, but see no Vánars still"
57841,BOOK VI.(895),"Who wear each varied shape at will."""
57842,BOOK VI.(895),
57843,BOOK VI.(895),"In eager love thus Bharat cried,"
57844,BOOK VI.(895),And thus the Wind-God's son replied:
57845,BOOK VI.(895),"""Look, Bharat, on those laden trees"
57846,BOOK VI.(895),That murmur with the song of bees;
57847,BOOK VI.(895),For Ráma's sake the saint has made
57848,BOOK VI.(895),"Untimely fruits, unwonted shade."
57849,BOOK VI.(895),Such power in ages long ago
57850,BOOK VI.(895),Could Indra's gracious boon bestow.
57851,BOOK VI.(895),"O, hear the Vánars' voices, hear"
57852,BOOK VI.(895),The shouting which proclaims them near.
57853,BOOK VI.(895),E'en now about to cross they seem
57854,BOOK VI.(895),Sweet Gomatí's delightful stream.
57855,BOOK VI.(895),"I see, I see the car designed"
57856,BOOK VI.(895),"By Brahmá's own creative mind,"
57857,BOOK VI.(895),"The car which, radiant as the moon,"
57858,BOOK VI.(895),Moves at the will by Brahmá's boon;
57859,BOOK VI.(895),"The car which once was Rávan's pride,"
57860,BOOK VI.(895),The victor's spoil when Rávan died.
57861,BOOK VI.(895),"Look, there are Raghu's sons: between"
57862,BOOK VI.(895),The brothers stands the rescued queen.
57863,BOOK VI.(895),"There is Vibhishan full in view,"
57864,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva and his retinue."""
57865,BOOK VI.(895),
57866,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: then rapture loosed each tongue:
57867,BOOK VI.(895),"From men and dames, from old and young,"
57868,BOOK VI.(895),"One long, one universal cry,"
57869,BOOK VI.(895),"'Tis he, 'tis Ráma, smote the sky."
57870,BOOK VI.(895),All lighted down with eager speed
57871,BOOK VI.(895),"From elephant and car and steed,"
57872,BOOK VI.(895),And every joyful eye intent
57873,BOOK VI.(895),On Ráma's moonbright face was bent.
57874,BOOK VI.(895),Entranced a moment Bharat gazed:
57875,BOOK VI.(895),"Then reverential hands he raised,"
57876,BOOK VI.(895),And on his brother humbly pressed
57877,BOOK VI.(895),The honours due to welcome guest.
57878,BOOK VI.(895),Then Bharat clomb the car to greet
57879,BOOK VI.(895),"His king and bowed him at his feet,"
57880,BOOK VI.(895),Till Ráma raised him face to face
57881,BOOK VI.(895),And held him in a close embrace.
57882,BOOK VI.(895),Then Lakshman and the Maithil dame
57883,BOOK VI.(895),He greeted as he spoke his name(1026)
57884,BOOK VI.(895),"He greeted next, supreme in place,"
57885,BOOK VI.(895),"The sovereign of the Vánar race,"
57886,BOOK VI.(895),"And Jámbaván and Báli's son,"
57887,BOOK VI.(895),"And lords and chiefs, omitting none.(1027)"
57888,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva to his heart he pressed
57889,BOOK VI.(895),And thus with grateful words addressed:
57890,BOOK VI.(895),"""Four brothers, Vánar king, were we,"
57891,BOOK VI.(895),And now we boast a fifth in thee.
57892,BOOK VI.(895),By kindly acts a friend we know:
57893,BOOK VI.(895),"Offence and wrong proclaim the foe."""
57894,BOOK VI.(895),To King Vibhishan then he spake:
57895,BOOK VI.(895),"""Well hast thou fought for Ráma's sake."""
57896,BOOK VI.(895),Nor was the brave Satrughna slow
57897,BOOK VI.(895),His reverential love to show
57898,BOOK VI.(895),"To both his brothers, as was meet,"
57899,BOOK VI.(895),And venerate the lady's feet.
57900,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Ráma to his mother came,"
57901,BOOK VI.(895),"Saw her pale cheek and wasted frame,"
57902,BOOK VI.(895),"With gentle words her heart consoled,"
57903,BOOK VI.(895),And clasped her feet with loving hold.
57904,BOOK VI.(895),"Then at Sumitrá's feet he bent,"
57905,BOOK VI.(895),"And fair Kaikeyí's, reverent,"
57906,BOOK VI.(895),"Greeted each dame from chief to least,"
57907,BOOK VI.(895),And bowed him to the household priest.
57908,BOOK VI.(895),Up rose a shout from all the throng:
57909,BOOK VI.(895),"""O welcome, Ráma, mourned so long."
57910,BOOK VI.(895),"Welcome, Kausalyá's joy and pride,"""
57911,BOOK VI.(895),Ten hundred thousand voices cried.
57912,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Bharat placed, in duty taught,"
57913,BOOK VI.(895),On Ráma's feet the shoes he brought:
57914,BOOK VI.(895),"""My King,"" he cried, ""receive again"
57915,BOOK VI.(895),"The pledge preserved through years of pain,"
57916,BOOK VI.(895),The rule and lordship of the land
57917,BOOK VI.(895),Entrusted to my weaker hand.
57918,BOOK VI.(895),"No more I sigh o'er sorrows past,"
57919,BOOK VI.(895),My birth and life are blest at last
57920,BOOK VI.(895),"In the glad sight this day has shown,"
57921,BOOK VI.(895),"When Ráma comes to rule his own."""
57922,BOOK VI.(895),
57923,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: the faithful love that moved
57924,BOOK VI.(895),The prince's soul each heart approved;
57925,BOOK VI.(895),Nor could the Vánar chiefs refrain
57926,BOOK VI.(895),From tender tears that fell like rain.
57927,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Ráma, stirred with joy anew,"
57928,BOOK VI.(895),"His arms about his brother threw,"
57929,BOOK VI.(895),And to the grove his course he bent
57930,BOOK VI.(895),Where Bharat's hermit days were spent.
57931,BOOK VI.(895),Alighting in that pure retreat
57932,BOOK VI.(895),He pressed the earth with eager feet.
57933,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, at his hest, the car rose high"
57934,BOOK VI.(895),And sailing through the northern sky
57935,BOOK VI.(895),Sped homeward to the Lord of Gold
57936,BOOK VI.(895),Who owned the wondrous prize of old.(1028)

57943,BOOK VI.(895),
57944,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, reverent hand to hand applied,"
57945,BOOK VI.(895),Thus Bharat to his brother cried:
57946,BOOK VI.(895),"""Thy realm, O King, is now restored,"
57947,BOOK VI.(895),Uninjured to the rightful lord.
57948,BOOK VI.(895),"This feeble arm with toil and pain,"
57949,BOOK VI.(895),The weighty charge could scarce sustain.
57950,BOOK VI.(895),And the great burthen wellnigh broke
57951,BOOK VI.(895),The neck untrained to bear the yoke.
57952,BOOK VI.(895),The royal swan outspeeds the crow:
57953,BOOK VI.(895),"The steed is swift, the mule is slow,"
57954,BOOK VI.(895),Nor can my feeble feet be led
57955,BOOK VI.(895),O'er the rough ways where thine should tread.
57956,BOOK VI.(895),Now grant what all thy subjects ask:
57957,BOOK VI.(895),"Begin, O King, thy royal task."
57958,BOOK VI.(895),Now let our longing eyes behold
57959,BOOK VI.(895),"The glorious rite ordained of old,"
57960,BOOK VI.(895),And on the new-found monarch's head
57961,BOOK VI.(895),"Let consecrating drops be shed."""
57962,BOOK VI.(895),
57963,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased; victorious Ráma bent
57964,BOOK VI.(895),His head in token of assent.
57965,BOOK VI.(895),"He sat, and tonsors trimmed with care"
57966,BOOK VI.(895),His tangles of neglected hair
57967,BOOK VI.(895),"Then, duly bathed, the hero shone"
57968,BOOK VI.(895),With all his splendid raiment on.
57969,BOOK VI.(895),And Sítá with the matrons' aid
57970,BOOK VI.(895),"Her limbs in shining robes arrayed,"
57971,BOOK VI.(895),"Sumantra then, the charioteer,"
57972,BOOK VI.(895),"Drew, ordered by Satrughna near,"
57973,BOOK VI.(895),And stayed within the hermit grove
57974,BOOK VI.(895),The chariot and the steeds he drove.
57975,BOOK VI.(895),"Therein Sugríva's consorts, graced"
57976,BOOK VI.(895),"With gems, and Ráma's queen were placed,"
57977,BOOK VI.(895),All fain Ayodhyá to behold:
57978,BOOK VI.(895),And swift away the chariot rolled.
57979,BOOK VI.(895),"Like Indra Lord of Thousand Eyes,"
57980,BOOK VI.(895),Drawn by fleet lions through the skies.
57981,BOOK VI.(895),Thus radiant in his glory showed
57982,BOOK VI.(895),"King Ráma as he homeward rode,"
57983,BOOK VI.(895),In power and might unparalleled.
57984,BOOK VI.(895),The reins the hand of Bharat held.
57985,BOOK VI.(895),Above the peerless victor's head
57986,BOOK VI.(895),"The snow-white shade Satrughna spread,"
57987,BOOK VI.(895),And Lakshman's ever-ready hand
57988,BOOK VI.(895),His forehead with a chourie fanned.
57989,BOOK VI.(895),Vibhishan close to Lakshman's side
57990,BOOK VI.(895),Sharing his task a chourie plied.
57991,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva on Satrunjay came,"
57992,BOOK VI.(895),An elephant of hugest frame:
57993,BOOK VI.(895),"Nine thousand others bore, behind,"
57994,BOOK VI.(895),The chieftains of the Vánar kind
57995,BOOK VI.(895),"All gay, in forms of human mould,"
57996,BOOK VI.(895),With rich attire and gems and gold.
57997,BOOK VI.(895),Thus borne along in royal state
57998,BOOK VI.(895),King Ráma reached Ayodbyá's gate
57999,BOOK VI.(895),With merry noise of shells and drums
58000,BOOK VI.(895),"And joyful shouts, He comes, he comes,"
58001,BOOK VI.(895),"A Bráhman host with solemn tread,"
58002,BOOK VI.(895),"And kine the long procession led,"
58003,BOOK VI.(895),And happy maids in ordered bands
58004,BOOK VI.(895),Threw grain and gold with liberal hands.
58005,BOOK VI.(895),Neath gorgeous flags that waved in rows
58006,BOOK VI.(895),On towers and roofs and porticoes.
58007,BOOK VI.(895),Mid merry crowds who sang and cheered
58008,BOOK VI.(895),The palace of the king they neared.
58009,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Raghu's son to Bharat, best"
58010,BOOK VI.(895),"Of duty's slaves, these words addressed:"
58011,BOOK VI.(895),"""Pass onward to the monarch's hall."
58012,BOOK VI.(895),"The high-souled Vánars with thee call,"
58013,BOOK VI.(895),"And let the chieftains, as is meet,"
58014,BOOK VI.(895),The widows of our father greet.
58015,BOOK VI.(895),And to the Vánar king assign
58016,BOOK VI.(895),"Those chambers, best of all, which shine"
58017,BOOK VI.(895),"With lazulite and pearl inlaid,"
58018,BOOK VI.(895),"And pleasant grounds with flowers and shade."""
58019,BOOK VI.(895),
58020,BOOK VI.(895),He ceased: and Bharat bent his head;
58021,BOOK VI.(895),Sugríva by the hand he led
58022,BOOK VI.(895),And passed within the palace where
58023,BOOK VI.(895),"Stood couches which Satrughna's care,"
58024,BOOK VI.(895),"With robes and hangings richly dyed,"
58025,BOOK VI.(895),"And burning lamps, had seen supplied."
58026,BOOK VI.(895),"Then Bharat spake: ""I pray thee, friend,"
58027,BOOK VI.(895),"Thy speedy messengers to send,"
58028,BOOK VI.(895),Each sacred requisite to bring
58029,BOOK VI.(895),"That we may consecrate our king."""
58030,BOOK VI.(895),"Sugríva raised four urns of gold,"
58031,BOOK VI.(895),"The water for the rite to hold,"
58032,BOOK VI.(895),And bade four swiftest Vánars flee
58033,BOOK VI.(895),And fill them from each distant sea.
58034,BOOK VI.(895),Then east and west and south and north
58035,BOOK VI.(895),The Vánar envoys hastened forth.
58036,BOOK VI.(895),Each in swift flight an ocean sought
58037,BOOK VI.(895),"And back through air his treasure brought,"
58038,BOOK VI.(895),And full five hundred floods beside
58039,BOOK VI.(895),Pure water for the king supplied.
58040,BOOK VI.(895),"Then girt by many a Bráhman sage,"
58041,BOOK VI.(895),"Vasishtha, chief for reverend age,"
58042,BOOK VI.(895),High on a throne with jewels graced
58043,BOOK VI.(895),King Ráma and his Sítá placed.
58044,BOOK VI.(895),"There by Jábáli, far revered,"
58045,BOOK VI.(895),Vijay and Kasyap's son appeared;
58046,BOOK VI.(895),"By Gautam's side Kátváyan stood,"
58047,BOOK VI.(895),"And Vámadeva wise and good,"
58048,BOOK VI.(895),Whose holy hands in order shed
58049,BOOK VI.(895),The pure sweet drops on Ráma's head.
58050,BOOK VI.(895),"Then priests and maids and warriors, all"
58051,BOOK VI.(895),"Approaching at Vasishtha's call,"
58052,BOOK VI.(895),"With sacred drops bedewed their king,"
58053,BOOK VI.(895),"The centre of a joyous ring,"
58054,BOOK VI.(895),"The guardians of the worlds, on high,"
58055,BOOK VI.(895),And all the children of the sky
58056,BOOK VI.(895),From herbs wherewith their hands were filled
58057,BOOK VI.(895),Rare juices on his brow distilled.
58058,BOOK VI.(895),His brows were bound with glistering gold
58059,BOOK VI.(895),"Which Manu's self had worn of old,"
58060,BOOK VI.(895),Bright with the flash of many a gem
58061,BOOK VI.(895),His sire's ancestral diadem.
58062,BOOK VI.(895),Satrughna lent his willing aid
58063,BOOK VI.(895),And o'er him held the regal shade:
58064,BOOK VI.(895),The monarchs whom his arm had saved
58065,BOOK VI.(895),The chouries round his forehead waved.
58066,BOOK VI.(895),"A golden chain, that flashed and glowed"
58067,BOOK VI.(895),With gems the God of Wind bestowed:
58068,BOOK VI.(895),Mahendra gave a glorious string
58069,BOOK VI.(895),"Of fairest pearls to deck the king,"
58070,BOOK VI.(895),"The skies with acclamation rang,"
58071,BOOK VI.(895),"The gay nymphs danced, the minstrels sang."
58072,BOOK VI.(895),On that blest day the joyful plain
58073,BOOK VI.(895),Was clothed anew with golden grain.
58074,BOOK VI.(895),"The trees the witching influence knew,"
58075,BOOK VI.(895),"And bent with fruits of loveliest hue,"
58076,BOOK VI.(895),And Ráma's consecration lent
58077,BOOK VI.(895),New sweetness to each flowret's scent.
58078,BOOK VI.(895),"The monarch, joy of Raghu's line,"
58079,BOOK VI.(895),"Gave largess to the Bráhmans, kine"
58080,BOOK VI.(895),"And steeds unnumbered, wealth untold"
58081,BOOK VI.(895),Of robes and pearls and gems and gold.
58082,BOOK VI.(895),"A jewelled chain, whose lustre passed"
58083,BOOK VI.(895),"The glory of the sun, he cast"
58084,BOOK VI.(895),About his friend Sugríva's neck;
58085,BOOK VI.(895),"And, Angad Báli's son to deck,"
58086,BOOK VI.(895),He gave a pair of armlets bright
58087,BOOK VI.(895),With diamond and lazulite.
58088,BOOK VI.(895),A string of pearls of matchless hue
58089,BOOK VI.(895),Which gleams like tender moonlight threw

58139,APPENDIX.,"subdued passions, seeking the happiness of the king, proceeded to perform"
58140,APPENDIX.,the sacrifice for the accomplishment of his wishes. Hither were previously
58141,APPENDIX.,"collected the gods, with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the sages, for"
58142,APPENDIX.,"the sake of receiving their respective shares, Brahmá too, the sovereign"

58144,APPENDIX.,"supporters of the universe, and the divine mothers of all the celestials,"
58145,APPENDIX.,"met together there. To the Asvamedha, the great sacrifice of the"
58146,APPENDIX.,"magnanimous monarch, came also Indra the glorious one, surrounded by the"
58147,APPENDIX.,Maruts. Rishyasring then supplicated the gods assembled for their share of
58148,APPENDIX.,"the sacrifice (saying), ""This devout king Dasaratha, who, through the"
58149,APPENDIX.,"desire of offspring, confiding in you, has performed sacred austerities,"
58150,APPENDIX.,"and who has offered to you the sacrifice called Asvamedha, is about to"
58151,APPENDIX.,perform another sacrifice for the sake of obtaining sons: To him thus
58152,APPENDIX.,desirous of offspring be pleased to grant the blessing: I supplicate you
58153,APPENDIX.,"all with joined hands. May he have four sons, renowned through the"
58154,APPENDIX.,"universe."" The gods replied to the sage's son supplicating with joined"
58155,APPENDIX.,"hands, ""Be it so: thou, O Bráhman, art ever to be regarded by us, as the"
58156,APPENDIX.,king is in a peculiar manner. The lord of men by this sacrifice shall
58157,APPENDIX.,"obtain the great object of his desires."" Having thus said, the gods"

58159,APPENDIX.,
58160,APPENDIX.,They all then having seen that (sacrifice) performed by the great sage
58161,APPENDIX.,"according to the ordinance went to Prajápati the lord of mankind, and with"

58167,APPENDIX.,"the gods, the Dánavas and the Yakshas have born (_sic_) all, (his"

58169,APPENDIX.,"inflated by this promise unjustly vexes the divine sages, the Yakshas, and"
58170,APPENDIX.,"Gandharvas, the Asuras, and men: where Rávana remains there the sun loses"
58171,APPENDIX.,"his force, the winds through fear of him do not blow; the fire ceases to"
58172,APPENDIX.,"burn; the rolling ocean, seeing him, ceases to move its waves. Visravas,"
58173,APPENDIX.,"distressed by his power, has abandoned Lanká and fled. O divine one save"

58176,APPENDIX.,
58177,APPENDIX.,"Brahmá thus informed by the devas, reflecting, replied, ""Oh! I have"

58179,APPENDIX.,"requesting, 'May I be invulnerable to the divine sages, the Gaundharvas,"
58180,APPENDIX.,"the Yakshas, the Rákshasas and the serpents,' I replied 'Be it so.' This"
58181,APPENDIX.,"Ráksha, through contempt, said nothing respecting man; therefore this"
58182,APPENDIX.,"wicked one shall be destroyed by man."" The gods, preceded by Sakra,"
58183,APPENDIX.,"hearing these words spoken by Brahmá, were filled with joy."
58184,APPENDIX.,
58185,APPENDIX.,"At this time Vishnu the glorious, the lord of the world, arrayed in"

58188,APPENDIX.,"hand. Being adored by the excellent celestials, and welcomed by Brahmá, he"
58189,APPENDIX.,"drew near and stood before him. All the gods then addressed Vishnu, ""O"
58190,APPENDIX.,"Madhusudana, thou art able to abolish the distress of the distressed. We"
58191,APPENDIX.,"intreat thee, be our sanctuary, O Vishnu."" Vishnu replied, ""Say, what"
58192,APPENDIX.,"shall I do?"" The celestials hearing these his words added further. ""The"
58193,APPENDIX.,"virtuous, the encourager of excellence, eminent for truth, the firm"

58202,APPENDIX.,"by the exertion of his power, afflicts the gods, the Gandharvaa, the"

58209,APPENDIX.,
58210,APPENDIX.,"Vishnu, the sovereign of the gods, the chief of the celestials, adored by"

58565,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the rishis [saints] assembled to greet him, and Agastya, in answer to his"
58566,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,questions recounted many particulars regarding his old enemies. In the
58567,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Krita Yuga (or Golden Age) the austere and pious Brahman rishi Pulastya, a"
58568,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"son of Brahmá, being teased with the visits of different damsels,"
58569,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,proclaimed that any one of them whom he again saw near his hermitage
58570,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,should become pregnant. This had not been heard by the daughter of the
58571,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"royal rishi Trinavindu, who one day came into Pulastya's neighbourhood,"
58572,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"and her pregnancy was the result (Sect. 2, vv. 14 ff.). After her return"
58573,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"home, her father, seeing her condition, took her to Pulastya, who accepted"
58574,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"her as his wife, and she bore a son who received the name of Visravas."
58575,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"This son was, like his father, an austere and religious sage. He married"
58576,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the daughter of the muni Bharadvája, who bore him a son to whom Brahmá"
58577,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"gave the name of Vaisravan-Kuvera (Sect. 3, vv. 1 ff.). He performed"
58578,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"austerities for thousands of years, when he obtained from Brahmá as a boon"
58579,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"that he should be one of the guardians of the world (along with Indra,"
58580,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Varuna, and Yáma) and the god of riches. He afterwards consulted his"
58581,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"father Visravas about an abode, and at his suggestion took possession of"
58582,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the city of Lanká, which had formerly been built by Visvakarmán for the"
58583,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Rákshasas, but had been abandoned by them through fear of Vishnu, and was"
58584,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,at that time unoccupied. Ráma then (Sect. 4) says he is surprised to hear
58585,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"that Lanká had formerly belonged to the Rákshasas, as he had always"
58586,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"understood that they were the descendants of Pulastya, and now he learns"
58587,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,that they had also another origin. He therefore asks who was their
58588,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"ancestor, and what fault they had committed that they were chased away by"
58589,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Vishnu. Agastya replies that when Brahmá created the waters, he formed"
58590,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"certain beings,--some of whom received the name of Rákshasas,--to guard"
58591,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,them. The first Rákshasas kings were Heti and Praheti. Heti married a
58592,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"sister of Kála (Time). She bore him a son Vidyutkesa, who in his turn took"
58593,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"for his wife Lankatanka[t.]á, the daughter of Sandhyá (V. 21). She bore"
58594,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"him a son Sukesa, whom she abandoned, but he was seen by Siva as he was"
58595,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"passing by with his wife Párvatí, who made the child as old as his mother,"
58596,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"and immortal, and gave him a celestial city. Sukesa married a Gandharví"
58597,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"called Devavatí who bore three sons, Mályavat, Sumáli and Máli. These sons"
58598,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"practised intense austerities, when Brahmá appeared and conferred on them"
58599,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,invincibility and long life. They then harassed the gods. Visvakarmá gave
58600,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"them a city, Lanká, on the mountain Trikúta, on the shore of the southern"
58601,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"ocean, which he had built at the command of Indra.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The three Rákshasa,"
58602,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Mályavat and his two brothers, then began to oppress the gods, rishis,"
58603,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"etc.; who (Sect. 6, v. 1 ff.) in consequence resort for aid to Mahádeva,"
58604,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"who having regard to his protégé Sukesa the father of Mályavat, says that"
58605,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"he cannot kill the Rákshasas, but advises the suppliants to go to Vishnu,"
58606,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"which they do, and receive from him a promise that he will destroy their"
58607,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"enemies. The three Rákshasa kings, hearing of this, consult together, and"
58608,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,proceed to heaven to attack the gods. Vishnu prepares to meet them. The
58609,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,battle is described in the seventh section. The Rákshasas are defeated by
58610,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Vishnu with great slaughter, and driven back to Lanká, one of their"
58611,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"leaders, Máli, being slain. Mályavat remonstrates with Vishnu, who was"
58612,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"assaulting the rear of the fugitives, for his unwarrior-like conduct, and"
58613,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"wishes to renew the combat (Sect. 8, v. 3 ff.). Vishnu replies that he"
58614,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"must fulfil his promise to the gods by slaying the Rákshasas, and that he"
58615,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"would destroy them even if they fled to Pátála. These Rákshasas, Agastya"
58616,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"says, were more powerful than Rávana, and, could only be destroyed by"
58617,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Náráyana, _i.e._ by Ráma himself, the eternal, indestructible god. Sumáli"
58618,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"with his family lived for along time in Pátála, while Kuvera dwelt in"
58619,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Lanká. In section 9 it is related that Sumáli once happened to visit the
58620,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"earth, when he observed Kuvera going in his chariot to see his father"
58621,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Visravas. This leads him to consider how he might restore his own
58622,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,fortunes. He consequently desires his daughter Kaikasí to go and woo
58623,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Visravas, who receives her graciously. She becomes the mother of the"
58624,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"dreadful Rávana, of the huge Kumbhakarna, of Súrpanakhá, and of the"
58625,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"righteous Vibhishana, who was the last son. These children grow up in the"
58626,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,forest. Kumbhakarna goes about eating rishis. Kuvera comes to visit his
58627,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"father, when Kaikasí takes occasion to urge her son Rávana to strive to"
58628,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,become like his brother (Kuvera) in splendour. This Rávana promises to do.
58629,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,He then goes to the hermitage of Gokarna with his brothers to perform
58630,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,austerity. In section 10 their austere observances are described: after a
58631,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,thousand years' penance Rávana throws his head into the fire. He repeats
58632,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"this oblation nine times after equal intervals, and is about to do it the"
58633,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"tenth time, when Brahmá appears, and offers a boon. Rávana asks"
58634,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"immortality, but is refused. He then asks that he may be indestructible by"
58635,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,all creatures more powerful than men; which boon is accorded by Brahmá
58636,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,together with the recovery of all the heads he had sacrificed and the
58637,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,power of assuming any shape he pleased. Vibhishana asks as his boon that
58638,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"even amid the greatest calamities he may think only of righteousness, and"
58639,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"that the weapon of Brahmá may appear to him unlearnt, etc. The god grants"
58640,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"his request, and adds the gift of immortality. When Brahmá is about to"
58641,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"offer a boon to Kumbhakarna, the gods interpose, as, they say, he had"
58642,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"eaten seven Apsarases and ten followers of Indra, besides rishis and men;"
58643,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,and beg that under the guise of a boon stupefaction may be inflicted on
58644,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"him. Brahmá thinks on Sarasvatí, who arrives and, by Brahmá's command,"
58645,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,enters into Kumbhakarna's mouth that she may speak for him. Under this
58646,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"influence he asks that he may receive the boon of sleeping for many years,"
58647,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"which is granted. When however Sarasvatí has left him, and he recovers his"
58648,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"own consciousness, he perceives that he has been deluded. Kuvera by his"
58649,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"father's advice, gives up the city of Lanká to Rávan.""(1031) Rávana"
58650,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,marries (Sect. 12) Mandodarí the beautiful daughter of the Asur Maya whose
58651,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,name has several times occurred in the Rámáyan as that of an artist of
58652,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,wonderful skill. She bears a son Meghanáda or the Roaring Cloud who was
58653,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,afterwards named Indrajít from his victory over the sovereign of the
58654,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"skies. The conquest of Kuvera, and the acquisition of the magic"
58655,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"self-moving chariot which has done much service in the Rámáyan, form the"
58656,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"subject of sections XIII., XIV. and XV. ""The rather pretty story of"
58657,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Vedavatí is related in the seventeenth section, as follows: Rávana in the"
58658,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"course of his progress through the world, comes to the forest on the"
58659,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Himálaya, where he sees a damsel of brilliant beauty, but in ascetic garb,"
58660,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,of whom he straightway becomes enamoured. He tells her that such an
58661,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"austere life is unsuited to her youth and attractions, and asks who she is"
58662,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,and why she is leading an ascetic existence. She answers that she is
58663,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"called Vedavatí, and is the vocal daughter of Vrihaspati's son, the rishi"
58664,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Kusadhwaja, sprung from him during his constant study of the Veda. The"
58665,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"gods, gandharvas, etc., she says, wished that she should choose a husband,"
58666,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"but her father would give her to no one else than to Vishnu, the lord of"
58667,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the world, whom he desired for his son-in-law. Vedavatí then proceeds: 'In"
58668,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"order that I may fulfil this desire of my father in respect of Náráyana, I"
58669,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,wed him with my heart. Having entered into this engagement I practise
58670,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"great austerity. Náráyana and no other than he, Purushottama, is my"
58671,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"husband. From the desire of obtaining him, I resort to this severe"
58672,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,observance.' Rávana's passion is not in the least diminished by this
58673,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,explanation and he urges that it is the old alone who should seek to
58674,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"become distinguished by accumulating merit through austerity, prays that"
58675,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,she who is so young and beautiful shall become his bride; and boasts that
58676,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,he is superior to Vishnu. She rejoins that no one but he would thus
58677,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,contemn that deity. On receiving this reply he touches the hair of her
58678,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"head with the tip of his finger. She is greatly incensed, and forthwith"
58679,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"cuts off her hair and tells him that as he has so insulted her, she cannot"
58680,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"continue to live, but will enter into the fire before his eyes. She goes"
58681,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,on 'Since I have been insulted in the forest by thee who art
58682,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"wicked-hearted, I shall be born again for thy destruction. For a man of"
58683,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,evil desire cannot be slain by a woman; and the merit of my austerity
58684,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,would be lost if I were to launch a curse against thee. But if I have
58685,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,performed or bestowed or sacrificed aught may I be born the virtuous
58686,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"daughter, not produced from the womb, of a righteous man.' Having thus"
58687,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,spoken she entered the blazing fire. Then a shower of celestial flowers
58688,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"fell (from every part of the sky). It is she, lord, who, having been"
58689,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Vedavatí in the Krita age, has been born (in the Treta age) as the"
58690,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"daughter of the king of the Janakas, and (has become) thy [Ráma's] bride;"
58691,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,for thou art the eternal Vishnu. The mountain-like enemy who was
58692,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"[virtually] destroyed before by her wrath, has now been slain by her"
58693,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"having recourse to thy superhuman energy."" On this the commentator"
58694,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"remarks: ""By this it is signified that Sítá was the principal cause of"
58695,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Rávana's death; but the function of destroying him is ascribed to Ráma."""
58696,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"On the words, ""thou art Vishnu,"" in the preceding verse the same"
58697,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"commentator remarks: ""By this it is clearly affirmed that Sítá was"
58698,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Lakshmí."" This is what Parásara says: ""In the god's life as Ráma, she"
58699,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"became Sítá, and in his birth as Krishna [she became] Rukminí.""(1032)"
58700,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,
58701,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"In the following section (XVIII.) ""Rávana is described as violently"
58702,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"interrupting a sacrifice which is being performed by king Marutta, and the"
58703,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,assembled gods in terror assume different shapes to escape; Indra becomes
58704,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"a peacock, Yáma a crow, Kuvera a lizard, and Varuna a swan; and each deity"
58705,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,bestows a boon on the animal he had chosen. The peacock's tail recalls
58706,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Indra's thousand eyes; the swan's colour becomes white, like the foam of"
58707,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,the ocean (Varuna being its lord); the lizard obtains a golden colour; and
58708,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the crow is never to die except when killed by a violent death, and the"
58709,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,dead are to enjoy the funeral oblations when they have been devoured by
58710,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the crows.""(1033)"
58711,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,
58712,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Rávan then attacks Arjuna or Kárttavírya the mighty king of Máhishmati on
58713,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the banks of the Narmadá, and is defeated, captured and imprisoned by"
58714,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Arjuna. At the intercession of Pulastya (Sect. XXII.) he is released from
58715,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,his bonds. He then visits Kishkindhá where he enters into alliance with
58716,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Báli the King of the Vánars: ""We will have all things in common,"" says"
58717,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Rávan, ""dames, sons, cities and kingdoms, food, vesture, and all"
58718,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"delights."" His next exploit is the invasion of the kingdom of departed"
58719,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,spirits and his terrific battle with the sovereign Yáma. The poet in his
58720,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"description of these regions with the detested river with waves of blood,"
58721,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the dire lamentations, the cries for a drop of water, the devouring worm,"
58722,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,all the tortures of the guilty and the somewhat insipid pleasures of the
58723,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"just, reminds one of the scenes in the under world so vividly described by"
58724,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Yáma is defeated (Sect. XXVI.) by the giant, not"
58725,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,so much by his superior power as because at the request of Brahmá Yáma
58726,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,refrains from smiting with his deadly weapon the Rákshas enemy to whom
58727,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,that God had once given the promise that preserved him. In the
58728,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"twenty-seventh section Rávan goes ""under the earth into Pátála the"
58729,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"treasure-house of the waters inhabited by swarms of serpents and Daityas,"
58730,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"and well defended by Varun."" He subdues Bhogavatí the city ruled by Vásuki"
58731,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,and reduces the Nágas or serpents to subjection. He penetrates even to the
58732,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"imperial seat of Varun. The God himself is absent, but his sons come forth"
58733,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,and do battle with the invader. The giant is victorious and departs
58734,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,triumphant. The twenty-eighth section gives the details of a terrific
58735,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"battle between Rávan and Mándhátá King of Ayodhyá, a distinguished"
58736,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,ancestor of Ráma. Supernatural weapons are employed on both sides and the
58737,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,issue of the conflict is long doubtful. But at last Mándhátá prepares to
58738,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"use the mighty weapon ""acquired by severe austerities through the grace"
58739,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"and favour of Rudra."" The giant would inevitably have been slain. But two"
58740,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,pre-eminent Munis Pulastya and Gálava beheld the fight through the power
58741,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"given by contemplation, and with words of exhortation they parted King"
58742,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Mándhátá and the sovereign of the Rákshases. Rávan at last (Sect. XXXII.)
58743,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,returns homeward carrying with him in his car Pushpak the virgin daughters
58744,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"of kings, of Rishis, of Daityas, and Gandharvas whom he has seized upon"
58745,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"his way. The thirty-sixth section describes a battle with Indra, in which"
58746,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the victorious Meghanáda son of the giant, makes the King of the Gods his"
58747,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"prisoner, binds him with his magic art, and carries him away (Sect."
58748,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,XXVII.) in triumph to Lanká. Brahmá intercedes (Sect. XXXVIII.) and
58749,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Indrajít releases his prisoner on obtaining in return the boon that
58750,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,sacrifice to the Lord of Fire shall always make him invincible in the
58751,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"coming battle. In sections XXXIX., XL, ""we have a legend related to Ráma"
58752,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,by the sage Agastya to account for the stupendous strength of the monkey
58753,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Hanumán, as it had been described in the _Rámáyana_. Rama naturally"
58754,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,wonders (as perhaps many readers of the _Rámáyana_ have done since) why a
58755,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,monkey of such marvellous power and prowess had not easily overcome Báli
58756,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,and secured the throne for his friend Sugríva. Agastya replies that
58757,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Hanumán was at that time under a curse from a Rishi, and consequently was"
58758,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"not conscious of his own might.""(1034) The whole story of the marvellous"
58759,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Vánar is here given at length, but nothing else of importance is added to"
58760,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,the tale already given in the Rámáyana. The Rishis or saints then (Sect.
58761,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"XL.) return to their celestial seats, and the Vánars, Rákshases and bears"
58762,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,also (Sect. XLIII.) take their departure. The chariot Pushpak is restored
58763,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"to its original owner Kuvera, as has already been related in the Rámáyan."
58764,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,
58765,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"The story of Ráma and Sítá is then continued, and we meet with matter of"
58766,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,more human interest. The winter is past and the pleasant spring-time is
58767,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"come, and Ráma and Sítá sit together in the shade of the Asoka trees happy"
58768,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,as Indra and Sachí when they drink in Paradise the nectar of the Gods.
58769,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"""Tell me, my beloved,"" says Ráma, ""for thou wilt soon be a mother, hast"
58770,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"thou a wish in thy heart for me to gratify?"" And Sítá smiles and answers:"
58771,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"""I long, O son of Raghu, to visit the pure and holy hermitages on the"
58772,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,banks of the Ganges and to venerate the feet of the saints who there
58773,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,perform their rigid austerities and live on roots and berries. This is my
58774,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"chief desire, to stand within the hermits' grove were it but for a single"
58775,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"day."" And Ráma said: ""Let not the thought trouble thee: thou shalt go to"
58776,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"the grove of the ascetics."" But slanderous tongues have been busy in"
58777,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Ayodhyá, and Sítá has not been spared. Ráma hears that the people are"
58778,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,lamenting his blind folly in taking back to his bosom the wife who was so
58779,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,long a captive in the palace of Rávan. Ráma well knows her spotless purity
58780,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"in thought, word, and deed, and her perfect love of him; but he cannot"
58781,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,endure the mockery and the shame and resolves to abandon his unsuspecting
58782,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,wife. He orders the sad but still obedient Lakshman to convey her to the
58783,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"hermitage which she wishes to visit and to leave her there, for he will"
58784,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"see her face again no more. They arrive at the hermitage, and Lakshman"
58785,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"tells her all. She falls fainting on the ground, and when she recovers her"
58786,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,consciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her cruel and
58787,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,undeserved lot. But she resolves to live for the sake of Ráma and her
58788,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"unborn son, and she sends by Lakshman a dignified message to the husband"
58789,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"who has forsaken her: ""I grieve not for myself,"" she says ""because I have"
58790,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"been abandoned on account of what the people say, and not for any evil"
58791,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"that I have done. The husband is the God of the wife, the husband is her"
58792,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,lord and guide; and what seems good unto him she should do even at the
58793,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"cost of her life."""
58794,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,
58795,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"Sítá is honourably received by the saint Válmíki himself, and the holy"
58796,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,women of the hermitage are charged to entertain and serve her. In this
58797,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,calm retreat she gives birth to two boys who receive the names of Kusa and
58798,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,Lava. They are carefully brought up and are taught by Válmíki himself to
58799,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,recite the Rámáyan. The years pass by: and Ráma at length determines to
58800,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"celebrate the Asvamedha or Sacrifice of the Steed. Válmíki, with his two"
58801,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"young pupils, attends the ceremony, and the unknown princes recite before"
58802,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,the delighted father the poem which recounts his deeds. Ráma inquires into
58803,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,their history and recognizes them as his sons. Sítá is invited to return
58804,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,and solemnly affirm her innocence before the great assembly.
58805,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,
58806,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"""But Sítá's heart was too full; this second ordeal was beyond even her"
58807,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"power to submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level of"
58808,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,women when he ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling:
58809,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"'Beholding all the spectators, and clothed in red garments, Sítá clasping"
58810,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"her hands and bending low her face, spoke thus in a voice choked with"

58812,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"may Mádhaví the goddess of Earth, grant me a hiding-place."" As Sítá made"
58813,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"this oath, lo! a marvel appeared. Suddenly cleaving the earth, a divine"
58814,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"throne of marvellous beauty rose up, borne by resplendent dragons on their"
58815,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"heads: and seated on it, the goddess of Earth, raising Sítá with her arm,"
58816,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"said to her, ""Welcome to thee!"" and placed her by her side. And as the"
58817,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"queen, seated on the throne, slowly descended to Hades, a continuous"
58818,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"shower of flowers fell down from heaven on her head.'(1035)"""
58819,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,
58820,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"""Both the great Hindu epics thus end in disappointment and sorrow. In the"
58821,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,_Mahábhárata_ the five victorious brothers abandon the hardly won throne

58823,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"way Ráma only regains his wife, after all his toils, to lose her. It is"
58824,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,the same in the later Homeric cycle--the heroes of the _Iliad_ perish by
58825,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"ill-fated deaths. And even Ulysses, after his return to Ithaca, sets sail"
58826,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"again to Thesprotia, and finally falls by the hand of his own son. But in"
58827,HIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.,"India and Greece alike this is an afterthought of a self-conscious time,"

58966,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,their wives had taken refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then

58968,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the form of a tortoise, for the purpose of restoring to man some of the"
58969,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,comforts lost during the flood. To this end he stationed himself at the
58970,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"bottom of the ocean, and allowed the point of the great mountain Mandara"

58973,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"churned the waters for the recovery of the amrita or nectar, and fourteen"
58974,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"other sacred things. 3. The Varáha, or Boar. In this he descended in the"
58975,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,form of a boar to rescue the earth from the power of a demon called
58976,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"'golden-eyed,' Hiranyáksha. This demon had seized on the earth and carried"
58977,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"it with him into the depths of the ocean. Vishnu dived into the abyss, and"
58978,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"after a contest of a thousand years slew the monster. 4. The Narasinha, or"
58979,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Man-lion. In this monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion,"
58980,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Vishnu delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent demon called
58981,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Hiranyakasipu. 5. Vámana, or Dwarf. This avatár happened in the second age"
58982,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of the Hindús or Tretáyug, the four preceding are said to have occurred in"
58983,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the first or Satyayug; the object of this avatár was to trick Bali out of
58984,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the dominion of the three worlds. Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he
58985,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"appeared before the king and asked, as a boon, as much land as he could"

58988,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"earth, but in consideration of some merit, left Pátála still in his"
58989,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"dominion. 6. Parasuráma. 7. Rámchandra. 8. Krishna, or according to some"
58990,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Balaráma. 9. Buddha. In this avatár Vishnu descended in the form of a sage
58991,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"for the purpose of making some reform in the religion of the Brahmins, and"
58992,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,especially to reclaim them from their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many
58993,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,of the Hindús will not allow this to have been an incarnation of their
58994,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"favourite god. 10. Kalki, or White Horse. This is yet to come. Vishnu"
58995,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"mounted on a white horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet,"
58996,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"will, according to prophecy, end this present age, viz. the fourth or"

59012,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,creator or first person of the Triad. He is the particular God of the
59013,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Tántrikas, or followers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are"
59014,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"termed Saivas, and although not so numerous as the Vaishnavas, exalt their"

59016,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,attributes which properly belong to the other deities. According to them
59017,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Siva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the Destroyer and Creator. As"
59018,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"presiding over generation, his type is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin"

59020,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"generation and justice, which latter character he shares with the god"

59022,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"that of the bull, is generally white, referring probably to the unsullied"
59023,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,purity of Justice. His throat is dark-blue; his hair of a light reddish
59024,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"colour, and thickly matted together, and gathered above his head like the"
59025,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"hair of an ascetic. He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with"
59026,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"four, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three eyes, one being in"
59027,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the centre of his forehead, pointing up and down. These are said to denote"
59028,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"his view of the three divisions of time, past, present, and future. He"
59029,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his relationship to"
59030,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"water, or according to others, to show that the three great attributes of"
59031,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are"
59032,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"enveloped in a tiger's skin. In his character of Time, he not only"
59033,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"presides over its extinction, but also its astronomical regulation. A"
59034,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,crescent or half-moon on his forehead indicates the measure of time by the
59035,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,phases of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to denote the
59036,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"measure of time by years, and a second necklace of human skulls marks the"

59085,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"The _avatár_ which is here spoken of, that in which, according to Indian"
59086,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"traditions, Vishnu descended and appeared upon earth in the corporeal form"
59087,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of Ráma, the hero of the Rámáyana, is the seventh in the series of Indian"

59089,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"deficient knowledge of the ideas and doctrines of India, they have been"

59091,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the grossest errors that ignorance of the ideas and beliefs of a people
59092,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,has produced. Between the _avatárs_ of India and the Christian Incarnation
59093,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,there is such an immensity of difference that it is impossible to find any
59094,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,reasonable analogy that can approximate them. The idea of the _avatárs_ is
59095,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,intimately united with that of the Trimúrti; the bond of connection
59096,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"between these two ideas is an essential notion common to both, the notion"
59097,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,of Vishnu. What is the Trimúrti? I have already said that it is composed
59098,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of three Gods, Brahmá (masculine), Vishnu the God of _avatárs_, and Siva."
59099,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"These three Gods, who when reduced to their primitive and most simple"
59100,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"expression are but three cosmogonical personifications, three powers or"
59101,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"forces of nature, these Gods, I say, are here found, according to Indian"
59102,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"doctrines, entirely external to the true God of India, or Brahma in the"
59103,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"neuter gender. Brahma is alone, unchangeable in the midst of creation: all"
59104,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"emanates from him, he comprehends all, but he remains extraneous to all:"
59105,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,he is Being and the negation of beings. Brahma is never worshipped; the
59106,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,indeterminate Being is never invoked; he is inaccessible to the prayers as
59107,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the actions of man; humanity, as well as nature, is extraneous to him."
59108,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"External to Brahma rises the Trimúrti, that is to say, Brahmá (masculine)"
59109,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the power which creates, Vishnu the power which preserves, and Siva the"
59110,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,power which destroys: theogony here commences at the same time with
59111,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,cosmogony. The three divinities of the Trimúrti govern the phenomena of
59112,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the universe and influence all nature. The real God of India is by himself
59113,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,without power; real efficacious power is attributed only to three
59114,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"divinities who exist externally to him. Brahmá, Vishnu, and Siva,"
59115,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,possessed of qualities in part contradictory and attributes that are
59116,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"mutually exclusive, have no other accord or harmony than that which"
59117,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"results from the power of things itself, and which is found external to"
59118,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,their own thoughts. Such is the Indian Trimúrti. What an immense
59119,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,difference between this Triad and the wonderful Trinity of Christianity!
59120,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Here there is only one God, who created all, provides for all, governs"
59121,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"all. He exists in three Persons equal to one another, and intimately"
59122,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,united in one only infinite and eternal substance. The Father represents
59123,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the eternal thought and the power which created, the Son infinite love,"
59124,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the Holy Spirit universal sanctification. This one and triune God
59125,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"completes by omnipotent power the great work of creation which, when it"
59126,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"has come forth from His hands, proceeds in obedience to the laws which He"
59127,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"has given it, governed with certain order by His infinite providence."
59128,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
59129,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"""The immense difference between the Trimúrti of India and the Christian"
59130,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Trinity is found again between the _avatárs_ of Vishnu and the Incarnation
59131,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,of Christ. The _avatár_ was effected altogether externally to the Being
59132,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,who is in India regarded as the true God. The manifestation of one
59133,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,essentially cosmogonical divinity wrought for the most part only material
59134,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,and cosmogonical prodigies. At one time it takes the form of the gigantic
59135,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,tortoise which sustains Mount Mandar from sinking in the ocean; at another
59136,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of the fish which raises the lost Veda from the bottom of the sea, and"
59137,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,saves mankind from the waters. When these _avatárs_ are not cosmogonical
59138,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"they consist in some protection accorded to men or Gods, a protection"
59139,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,which is neither universal nor permanent. The very manner in which the
59140,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"_avatár_ is effected corresponds to its material nature, for instance the"
59141,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,mysterious vase and the magic liquor by means of which the _avatár_ here
59142,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,spoken of takes place. What are the forms which Vishnu takes in his
59143,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"descents? They are the simple forms of life; he becomes a tortoise, a"
59144,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"boar, a fish, but he is not obliged to take the form of intelligence and"
59145,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"liberty, that is to say, the form of man. In the _avatár_ of Vishnu is"
59146,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,discovered the inpress of pantheistic ideas which have always more or less
59147,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,prevailed in India. Does the _avatár_ produce a permanent and definitive
59148,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,result in the world? By no means. It is renewed at every catastrophe
59149,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"either of nature or man, and its effects are only transitory.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} To sum up"
59150,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"then, the Indian _avatár_ is effected externally to the true God of India,"
59151,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,to Brahma; it has only a cosmogonical or historical mission which is
59152,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,neither lasting nor decisive; it is accomplished by means of strange
59153,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,prodigies and magic transformations; it may assume promiscuously all the
59154,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,forms of life; it may be repeated indefinitely. Now let the whole of this
59155,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Indian idea taken from primitive tradition be compared with the
59156,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Incarnation of Christ and it will be seen that there is between the two an
59157,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,irreconcilable difference. According to the doctrines of Christianity the
59158,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Everlasting Word, Infinite Love, the Son of God, and equal to Him, assumed"
59159,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"a human body, and being born as a man accomplished by his divine act the"
59160,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,great miracle of the spiritual redemption of man. His coming had for its
59161,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,sole object to bring erring and lost humanity back to Him; this work being
59162,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"accomplished, and the divine union of men with God being re-established,"
59163,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,redemption is complete and remains eternal.

59631,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,same manner as Indra by the Vasus {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} and the observation which is made in
59632,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,some passages that a certain rite of the inauguration was performed
59633,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,'according to the sacred rule' {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} admit of the conclusion that the ceremony
59634,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the vaidik
59635,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,injunction.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} As the inauguration of _Ráma_ was intended and the necessary
59636,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"preparations for it were made when his father Dasaratha was still alive,"
59637,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"but as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-mother"
59638,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"_Kaikeyí_, did not take place then, but fourteen years later, after the"
59639,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"death of _Dasaratha_, an account of the preparatory ceremonies is given in"

59641,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"of the Rámáyana, but an account of the complete ceremony in the latter"
59642,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"book alone. According to the _Ayodhyákánda_, on the day preceding the"
59643,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"intended inauguration _Ráma_ and his wife _Sítá_ held a fast, and in the"
59644,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,night they performed this preliminary rite: _Ráma_ having made his
59645,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"ablutions, approached the idol of _Náráyana_, took a cup of clarified"
59646,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"butter, as the religious law prescribes, made a libation of it into the"
59647,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"kindled fire, and drank the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to"
59648,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"his heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity he lay, silent and"
59649,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"composed, together with _Sítá_, on a bed of Kusa-grass, which was spread"
59650,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"before the altar of Vishnu, until the last watch of the night, when he"
59651,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,awoke and ordered the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At
59652,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"day-break reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he performed"
59653,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In the meantime the
59654,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,town Ayodhyá had assumed a festive appearance and the inauguration
59655,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"implements had been arranged {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} golden water-jars, an ornamented"

59802,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"great dust that you behold, excellent Munis, is raised by troops of"
59803,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"clustering robbers, hastening to fall upon their prey.' The sages, hearing"
59804,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"this, consulted, and together rubbed the thigh of the king (Vena), who had"
59805,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"left no offspring, to produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came"
59806,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"forth a being of the complexion of a charred stake, with flattened"
59807,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"features like a negro, and of dwarfish stature. 'What am I to do,' cried"
59808,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"he eagerly to the Munis. 'Sit down (nishída),' said they. And thence his"
59809,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"name was Nisháda. His descendants, the inhabitants of the Vindhyá"
59810,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"mountain, great Muni, are still called Nishádas and are characterized by"
59811,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the exterior tokens of depravity."" Professor Wilson adds, in his note on"
59812,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the passage: ""The Matsya says that there were born outcast or barbarous"

60069,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"manners, beyond the artificial life of self-mortification and selfdenial"
60070,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,said to have been led by the Brahman sages of olden time. At the same

60072,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"poem, and upon the character in which the Brahmanical author desired to"
60073,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,represent Ráma; and consequently it deserves more serious consideration
60074,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,than the nature of the subject-matter would otherwise seem to imply.
60075,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60076,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"""According to the Rámáyana, the hero Ráma spent more than thirteen years"
60077,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"of his exile in wandering amongst the different Brahmanical settlements,"
60078,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,which appear to have been scattered over the country between the Ganges
60079,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,and the Godáveri; his wanderings extending from the hill of Chitra-kúta in
60080,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Bundelkund, to the modern town of Nasik on the western side of India, near"
60081,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the source of the Godáveri river, and about seventy-five miles to the"
60082,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,north-west of Bombay. The appearance of these Brahmanical hermitages in
60083,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the country far away to the south of the Raj of Kasala, seems to call for"
60084,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,critical inquiry. Each hermitage is said to have belonged to some
60085,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"particular sage, who is famous in Brahmanical tradition. But whether the"
60086,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"sages named were really contemporaries of Ráma, or whether they could"
60087,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"possibly have flourished at one and the same period, is open to serious"
60088,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,question. It is of course impossible to fix with any degree of certainty
60089,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the relative chronology of the several sages, who are said to have been"
60090,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,visited by Ráma; but still it seems tolerably clear that some belonged to
60091,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"an age far anterior to that in which the Rámáyana was composed, and"
60092,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,probably to an age anterior to that in which Ráma existed as a real and
60093,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"living personage; whilst, at least, one sage is to be found who could only"
60094,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,have existed in the age during which the Rámáyana was produced in its
60095,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,present form. The main proofs of these inferences are as follows. An
60096,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,interval of many centuries seems to have elapsed between the composition
60097,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,of the Rig-Veda and that of the Rámáyana: a conclusion which has long been
60098,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"proved by the evidence of language, and is generally accepted by Sanskrit"
60099,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"scholars. But three of the sages, said to have been contemporary with"
60100,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Ráma, namely, Visvámitra, Atri and Agastya, are frequently mentioned in"
60101,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the hymns of the Rig-Veda; whilst Válmíki, the sage dwelling at"
60102,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Chitra-kúta, is said to have been himself the composer of the Rámáyana."
60103,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Again, the sage Atri, whom Ráma visited immediately after his departure"
60104,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"from Chitra-kúta, appears in the genealogical list preserved in the Mahá"
60105,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Bhárata, as the progenitor of the Moon, and consequently as the first"
60106,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,ancestor of the Lunar race: whilst his grandson Buddha [Budha] is said to
60107,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"have married Ilá, the daughter of Ikhsváku who was himself the remote"
60108,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"ancestor of the Solar race of Ayodhyá, from whom Ráma was removed by many"
60109,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"generations. These conclusions are not perhaps based upon absolute proof,"
60110,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,because they are drawn from untrustworthy authorities; but still the
60111,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"chronological difficulties have been fully apprehended by the Pundits, and"
60112,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,an attempt has been made to reconcile all contradictions by representing
60113,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the sages to have lived thousands of years, and to have often re-appeared"
60114,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,upon earth in different ages widely removed from each other. Modern
60115,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,science refuses to accept such explanations; and consequently it is
60116,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,impossible to escape the conclusion that if Válmíki composed the Rámáyana
60117,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"in the form of Sanskrit in which it has been preserved, he could not have"
60118,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"flourished in the same age as the sages who are named in the Rig-Veda."""

60169,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Daksha for devotion
60170,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Made a mighty feast:

60179,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Called the gods unto it,"
60180,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Greatest as the least.
60181,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,All the gods were gathered

60273,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Then a trembling terror
60274,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Overcame each one,"

60326,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"""The personification of Urvasî herself is as thin as that of Eôs or"
60327,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Selęnę. Her name is often found in the Veda as a mere name for the
60328,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"morning, and in the plural number it is used to denote the dawns which"
60329,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,passing over men bring them to old age and death. Urvasî is the bright
60330,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"flush of light overspreading the heaven before the sun rises, and is but"
60331,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,another form of the many mythical beings of Greek mythology whose names
60332,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,take us back to the same idea or the same root. As the dawn in the Vedic
60333,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"hymns is called Urűkî, the far-going (Tęlephassa, Tęlephos), so is she"
60334,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"also Uruasî, the wide-existing or wide-spreading; as are Eurôpę,"
60335,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Euryanassa, Euryphassa, and many more of the sisters of Athęnę and"
60336,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Aphroditę. As such she is the mother of Vasishtha, the bright being, as"
60337,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Oidipous is the son of Iokastę; and although Vasishtha, like Oidipous, has"
60338,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"become a mortal bard or sage, he is still the son of Mitra and Varuna, of"
60339,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,night and day. Her lover Purűravas is the counterpart of the Hellenic
60340,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Polydeukęs; but the continuance of her union with him depends on the
60341,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"condition that she never sees him unclothed. But the Gandharvas, impatient"
60342,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,of her long sojourn among mortal men resolved to bring her back to their
60343,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,bright home; and Purűravas is thus led unwitingly to disregard her
60344,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"warning. A ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch, and the Gandharvas"
60345,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"stole one of them; Urvasî said, 'They take away my darling, as if I lived"
60346,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"in a land where there is no hero and no man.' They stole the second, and"
60347,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"she upbraided her husband again. Then Purűravas looked and said, 'How can"
60348,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,that be a land without heroes or men where I am?' And naked he sprang up;
60349,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,he thought it was too long to put on his dress. Then the Gandharvas sent a
60350,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"flash of lighting, and Urvasî saw her husband naked as by daylight. Then"
60351,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"she vanished. 'I come back,' she said, and went. 'Then he bewailed his"
60352,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"vanished love in bitter grief.' Her promise to return was fulfilled, but"
60353,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"for a moment only, at the Lotos-lake, and Purűravas in vain beseeches her"
60354,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,to tarry longer. 'What shall I do with thy speech?' is the answer of
60355,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Urvasî. 'I am gone like the first of the dawns. Purűravas, go home again."
60356,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,I am hard to be caught like the winds.' Her lover is in utter despair; but
60357,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"when he lies down to die, the heart of Urvasî was melted, and she bids him"
60358,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,come to her on the last night of the year. On that night only he might be
60359,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,with her; but a son should be born to him. On that day he went up to the
60360,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"golden seats, and there Urvasî told him that the Gandharvas would grant"
60361,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"him one wish, and that he must make his choice. 'Choose thou for me,' he"
60362,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"said: and she answered, 'Say to them, Let me be one of you.' """

60411,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60412,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60413,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"""The literal interpretation of this portion of the Rámáyana is indeed"
60414,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,deeply rooted in the mind of the Hindu. He implicitly believes that Ráma
60415,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"is Vishnu, who became incarnate for the purpose of destroying the demon"
60416,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Rávana: that he permitted his wife to be captured by Rávana for the sake
60417,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,of delivering the gods and Bráhmans from the oppressions of the Rákshasa;
60418,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"and that he ultimately assembled an army of monkeys, who were the progeny"
60419,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"of the gods, and led them against the strong-hold of Rávana at Lanká, and"
60420,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"delivered the world from the tyrant Rákshasa, whilst obtaining ample"
60421,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,revenge for his own personal wrongs.
60422,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60423,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"One other point seems to demand consideration, namely, the possibility of"
60424,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,such an alliance as that which Ráma is said to have concluded with the
60425,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"monkeys. This possibility will of course be denied by modern critics, but"
60426,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,still it is interesting to trace out the circumstances which seem to have
60427,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,led to the acceptance of such a wild belief by the dreamy and marvel
60428,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,loving Hindi. The south of India swarms with monkeys of curious
60429,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,intelligence and rare physical powers. Their wonderful instinct for
60430,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"organization, their attachment to particular localities, their occasional"
60431,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"journeys in large numbers over mountains and across rivers, their"
60432,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"obstinate assertion of supposed rights, and the ridiculous caricature"
60433,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"which they exhibit of all that is animal and emotional in man, would"
60434,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,naturally create a deep impression.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Indeed the habits of monkeys well
60435,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"deserve to be patiently studied; not as they appear in confinement, when"
60436,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"much that is revolting in their nature is developed, but as they appear"
60437,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"living in freedom amongst the trees of the forest, or in the streets of"
60438,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"crowded cities, or precincts of temples. Such a study would not fail to"
60439,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,awaken strange ideas; and although the European would not be prepared to
60440,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,regard monkeys as sacred animals he might be led to speculate as to their
60441,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"origin by the light of data, which are at present unknown to the"
60442,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,naturalist whose observations have been derived from the menagerie alone.
60443,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60444,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Whatever, however, may have been the train of ideas which led the Hindú to"
60445,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"regard the monkey as a being half human and half divine, there can be"
60446,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,little doubt that in the Rámáyana the monkeys of southern India have been
60447,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,confounded with what may be called the aboriginal people of the country.
60448,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,The origin of this confusion may be easily conjectured. Perchance the
60449,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,aborigines of the country may have been regarded as a superior kind of
60450,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"monkeys; and to this day the features of the Marawars, who are supposed to"
60451,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"be the aborigines of the southern part of the Carnatic, are not only"
60452,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"different from those of their neighbours, but are of a character"
60453,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"calculated to confirm the conjecture. Again, it is probable that the army"
60454,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,of aborigines may have been accompanied by outlying bands of monkeys
60455,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,impelled by that magpie-like curiosity and love of plunder which are the
60456,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,peculiar characteristics of the monkey race; and this incident may have
60457,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"given rise to the story that the army was composed of Monkeys."""

60492,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,bears of the Râmâyanam manifests itself several times. The king of the
60493,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"monkeys is a sun-god. The ancient king was named Bâlin, and was the son of"
60494,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Indras. His younger brother Sugrívas, he who changes his shape at pleasure"
60495,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"(Kâmarúpas), who, helped by Râmas, usurped his throne, is said to be own"

60503,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"monkeys resembles Indras when he promises to find the ravished Sítá, in"
60504,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,the same way as Vishnus in one of his incarnations finds again the lost
60505,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,vedás. And there are other indications in the Râmâyanam of opposition
60506,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,between Indras and the monkeys who assist Râmas. The great monkey
60507,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Hanumant, of the reddish colour of gold, has his jaw broken, Indras having"
60508,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"struck him with his thunderbolt and caused him to fall upon a mountain,"
60509,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"because, while yet a child, he threw himself off a mountain into the air"
60510,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"in order to arrest the course of the sun, whose rays had no effect upon"
60511,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"him. (The cloud rises from the mountain and hides the sun, which is unable"
60512,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"of itself to disperse it; the tempest comes, and brings flashes of"
60513,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"lightning and thunder-bolts, which tear the cloud in pieces.)"
60514,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60515,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,The whole legend of the monkey Hanumant represents the sun entering into
60516,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the cloud or darkness, and coming out of it. His father is said to be now"
60517,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the wind, now the elephant of the monkeys (Kapikunjaras), now Kesarin, the"
60518,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"long-haired sun, the sun with a mane, the lion sun (whence his name of"
60519,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"_Kesarinah putrah_). From this point of view, Hanumant would seem to be"
60520,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the brother of Sugrívas, who is also the offspring of the sun.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}"
60521,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60522,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,All the epic monkeys of the _Râmâyanam_ are described in the twentieth
60523,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,canto of the first book by expressions which very closely resemble those
60524,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"applied in the Vedic hymns to the Marutas, as swift as the tempestuous"
60525,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"wind, changing their shape at pleasure, making a noise like clouds,"
60526,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"sounding like thunder, battling, hurling mountain-peaks, shaking great"
60527,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"uprooted trees, stirring up the deep waters, crushing the earth with their"
60528,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"arms, making the clouds fall. Thus Bâlin comes out of the cavern as the"

60530,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60531,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,But the legend of the monkey Hanumant presents another curious resemblance
60532,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"to that of Samson. Hanumant is bound with cords by Indrajit, son of"

60592,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Professor Lassen remarks in the Zeitschrift für die Kunde des
60593,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Morgenlandes, ii. 62: ""At the furthest accessible extremity of the earth"
60594,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,appears Harivarsha with the northern Kurus. The region of Hari or Vishnu
60595,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,belongs to the system of mythical geography; but the case is different
60596,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,with the Uttara Kurus. Here there is a real basis of geographical fact; of
60597,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"which fable has only taken advantage, without creating it. The Uttara"
60598,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Kurus were formerly quite independent of the mythical system of _dvípas_,"
60599,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"though they were included in it at an early date."" Again the same writer"
60600,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"says at p. 65: ""That the conception of the Uttara Kurus is based upon an"
60601,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"actual country and not on mere invention, is proved (1) by the way in"
60602,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,which they are mentioned in the Vedas; (2) by the existence of Uttara Kuru
60603,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,in historical times as a real country; and (3) by the way in which the
60604,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,legend makes mention of that region as the home of primitive customs. To
60605,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,begin with the last point the Mahábhárata speaks as follows of the freer
60606,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"mode of life which women led in the early world, Book I. verses 4719-22:"
60607,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"'Women were formerly unconfined and roved about at their pleasure,"
60608,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,independent. Though in their youthful innocence they abandoned their
60609,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"husbands, they were guilty of no offence; for such was the rule in early"
60610,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,times. This ancient custom is even now the law for creatures born as
60611,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"brutes, which are free from lust and anger. This custom is supported by"
60612,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"authority and is observed by great rishis, and it is _still practiced"
60613,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,among the northern Kurus_.'
60614,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60615,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"""The idea which is here conveyed is that of the continuance in one part of"
60616,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,the world of that original blessedness which prevailed in the golden age.
60617,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,To afford a conception of the happy condition of the southern Kurus it is
60618,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"said in another place (M.-Bh, i. 4346.) 'The southern Kurus vied in"
60619,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,happiness with the northern Kurus and with the divine rishis and bards.'
60620,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,
60621,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Professor Lassen goes on to say: 'Ptolemy (vi. 16.) is also acquainted
60622,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"with _Uttara Kuru_. He speaks of a mountain, a people, and a city called"
60623,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,_Ottorakorra_. Most of the other ancient authors who elsewhere mention
60624,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"this name, have it from him. It is a part of the country which he calls"
60625,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Serica; according to him the city lies twelve degrees west from the
60626,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"metropolis of Sera, and the mountain extends from thence far to the"
60627,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,eastward. As Ptolemy has misplaced the whole of eastern Asia beyond the
60628,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"Ganges, the _relative_ position which he assigns will guide us better that"
60629,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"the absolute one, which removes _Ottorakorra_ so far to the east that a"
60630,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,correction is inevitable. According to my opinion the _Ottorakorra_ of
60631,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Ptolemy must be sought for to the east of Kashgar.' Lassen also thinks
60632,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,that Magasthenes had the Uttara Kurus in view when he referred to the
60633,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,Hyperboreans who were fabled by Indian writers to live a thousand years.
60634,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"In his Indian antiquities, (Ind. Alterthumskunde, i. 511, 512. and note,)"
60635,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,the same writer concludes that though the passages above cited relative to
60636,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,the Uttara Kurus indicate a belief in the existence of a really existing
60637,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"country of that name in the far north, yet that the descriptions there"
60638,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"given are to be taken as pictures of an ideal paradise, and not as founded"
60639,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"on any recollections of the northern origin of the Kurus. It is probable,"
60640,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"he thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed, and still"
60641,THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.,"survived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence in"

61073,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},I end these notes with an extract which I translate from Signor Gorresio's
61074,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"Preface to the tenth volume of his Rámáyan, and I take this opportunity of"
61075,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},again thankfully acknowledging my great obligations to this eminent
61076,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Sanskritist from whom I have so frequently borrowed. As Mr. Muir has
61077,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"observed, the Bengal recension which Signor Gorresio has most ably edited"
61078,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},is throughout an admirable commentary on the genuine Rámáyan of northern
61079,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"India, and I have made constant reference to the faithful and elegant"
61080,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},translation which accompanies the text for assistance and confirmation in
61081,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},difficulties:
61082,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61083,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"""Towards the southern extremity and in the island of Lanká (Ceylon) there"
61084,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"existed undoubtedly a black and ferocious race, averse to the Aryans and"
61085,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},hostile to their mode of worship: their ramifications extended through the
61086,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"islands of the Archipelago, and some traces of them remain in Java to this"
61087,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},day.
61088,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61089,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"The Sanskrit-Indians, applying to this race a name expressive of hatred"
61090,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"which occurs in the Vedas as the name of hostile, savage and detested"
61091,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"beings, called it the Rákshas race: it is against these Rákshases that the"
61092,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},expedition of Ráma which the Rámáyan celebrates is directed. The
61093,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Sanskrit-Indians certainly altered in their traditions the real character
61094,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},of this race: they attributed to it physical and moral qualities not found
61095,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},in human nature; they transformed it into a race of giants; they
61096,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"represented it as monstrous, hideous, truculent, changing forms at will,"
61097,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"blood-thirsty and ravenous, just as the Semites represented the races that"
61098,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"opposed them as impious, horrible and of monstrous size. But"
61099,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"notwithstanding these mythical exaggerations, which are partly due to the"
61100,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"genius of the Aryans so prone to magnify everything without measure, the"
61101,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Rámáyan in the course of its epic narration has still preserved and noted
61102,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},here and there some traits and peculiarities of the race which reveal its
61103,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"true character. It represents the Rákshases as black of hue, and compares"
61104,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},them with black clouds and masses of black collyrium; it attributes to
61105,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"them curly woolly hair and thick lips, it depicts them as loaded with"
61106,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"chains, collars and girdles of gold, and the other bright ornaments which"
61107,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"their race has always loved, and in which the kindred races of the Soudan"
61108,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},still delight. It describes them as worshippers of matter and force. They
61109,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},are hostile to the religion of the Aryans whose rites and sacrifices they
61110,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},disturb and ruin {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Such is the Rákshas race as represented in the Rámáyan;
61111,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"and the war of the Aryan Ráma forms the subject of the epic, a subject"
61112,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"certainly real and historical as far as regards its substance, but greatly"
61113,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},exaggerated by the ancient myth. In Sanskrit-Indian tradition are found
61114,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"traces of another struggle of the Aryans with the Rákshas races, which"
61115,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"preceded the war of Ráma. According to some pauranic legends, Kárttavírya,"
61116,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"a descendant of the royal tribe of the Yádavas, contemporary with"
61117,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"Parasurama and a little anterior to Ráma, attacked Lanká and took Rávan"
61118,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},prisoner. This well shows how ancient and how deeply rooted in the Aryan
61119,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},race is the thought of this war which the Rámáyan celebrates.
61120,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61121,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"""But,"" says an eminent Indianist(1181) whose learning I highly appreciate,"
61122,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"""the Rámáyan is an allegorical epic, and no precise and historical value"
61123,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"can be assigned to it. Sítá signifies the furrow made by the plough, and"
61124,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},under this symbolical aspect has already appeared honoured with worship in
61125,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},the hymns of the Rig-veda; Ráma is the bearer of the plough (this
61126,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},assertion is entirely gratuitous); these two allegorical personages
61127,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},represented agriculture introduced to the southern regions of India by the
61128,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},race of the Kosalas from whom Ráma was descended; the Rákshases on whom he
61129,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},makes war are races of demons and giants who have little or nothing human
61130,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"about them; allegory therefore predominates in the poem, and the exact"
61131,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"reality of an historical event must not be looked for in it."" Such is"
61132,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Professor Weber's opinion. If he means to say that mythical fictions are
61133,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"mingled with real events,"
61134,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61135,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"Forsan in alcun vero suo arco percuote,"
61136,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61137,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"as Dante says, and I fully concede the point. The interweaving of the myth"
61138,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"with the historical truth belongs to the essence, so to speak, of the"
61139,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"primitive epopeia. If Sítá is born, as the Rámáyan feigns, from the furrow"
61140,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"which King Janak opened when he ploughed the earth, not a whit more real"
61141,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"is the origin of Helen and Ćneas as related in Homer and Virgil, and if"
61142,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"the characters in the Rámáyan exceed human nature, and in a greater degree"
61143,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"perhaps than is the case in analogous epics, this springs in part from the"
61144,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},nature of the subject and still more from the symbol-loving genius of the
61145,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"orient. Still the characters of the Rámáyan, although they exceed more or"
61146,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"less the limits of human nature, act notwithstanding in the course of the"
61147,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"poem, speak, feel, rejoice and grieve according to the natural impulse of"
61148,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"human passions. But if by saying that the Rámáyan is an allegorical epic,"
61149,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"it is meant that its fundamental subject is nothing but allegory, that the"
61150,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"war of the Aryan Ráma against the Rákshas race is an allegory, that the"
61151,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"conquest of the southern region and of the island of Lanká is an allegory,"
61152,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},I do not hesitate to answer that such a presumption cannot be admitted and
61153,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},that the thing is in my opinion impossible. Father Paolíno da S.
61154,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"Bartolommeo,(1182) had already, together with other strange opinions of"
61155,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"his own on Indian matters, brought forward a similar idea, that is to say"
61156,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},that the exploit of Ráma which is the subject of the Rámáyan was a symbol
61157,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},and represented the course of the sun: thus he imagined that Brahmá was
61158,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"the earth, Vishnu the water, and that his avatárs were the blessings"
61159,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"brought by the fertilizing waters, etc. But such ideas, born at a time"
61160,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"when Indo-sanskrit antiquities were enveloped in darkness, have been"
61161,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},dissipated by the light of new studies. How could an epic so dear in India
61162,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"to the memory of the people, so deeply rooted for many centuries in the"
61163,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"minds of all, so propagated and diffused through all the dialects and"
61164,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"languages of those regions, which had become the source of many dramas"
61165,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"which are still represented in India, which is itself represented every"
61166,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},year with such magnificence and to such crowds of people in the
61167,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"neighbourhood of Ayodhyá, a poem welcomed at its very birth with such"
61168,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"favour, as the legend relates, that the recitation of it by the first"
61169,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},wandering Rhapsodists has consecrated and made famous all the places
61170,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"celebrated by them, and where Ráma made a shorter or longer stay, how, I"
61171,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"ask, could such an epic have been purely allegorical? How, upon a pure"
61172,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"invention, upon a simple allegory, could a poem have been composed of"
61173,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"about fifty thousand verses, relating with such force and power the"
61174,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"events, and giving details with such exactness? On a theme purely"
61175,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"allegorical there may easily be composed a short mythical poem, as for"
61176,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},example a poem on Proserpine or Psyche: but never an epic so full of
61177,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"traditions and historical memories, so intimately connected with the life"
61178,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"of the people, as the Rámáyan.(1183) Excessive readiness to find allegory"
61179,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"whenever some traces of symbolism occur, where the myth partly veils the"
61180,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"historical reality, may lead and often has led to error. What poetical"
61181,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},work of mythical times could stand this mode of trial? could there not be
61182,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"made, or rather has there not been made a work altogether allegorical, out"
61183,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},of the Homeric poems? We have all heard of the ingenious idea of the
61184,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"anonymous writer, who in order to prove how easily we may pass beyond the"
61185,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"truth in our wish to seek and find allegory everywhere, undertook with"
61186,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},keen subtlety to prove that the great personality of Napoleon I. was
61187,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},altogether allegorical and represented the sun. Napoleon was born in an
61188,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"island, his course was from west to east, his twelve marshals were the"
61189,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"twelve signs of the zodiac, etc."
61190,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61191,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"I conclude then, that the fundamental theme of the Rámáyan, that is to say"
61192,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"the war of the Aryan Ráma against the Rákshases, an Hamitic race settled"
61193,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"in the south, ought to be regarded as real and historical as far as"
61194,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"regards its substance, although the mythic element intermingled with the"
61195,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},true sometimes alters its natural and genuine aspect.
61196,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61197,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},How then did the Indo-Sanskrit epopeia form and complete itself? What
61198,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"elements did it interweave in its progress? How did it embody, how did it"
61199,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},clothe the naked and simple primitive datum? We must first of all remember
61200,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},that the Indo-European races possessed the epic genius in the highest
61201,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"degree, and that they alone in the different regions they occupied"
61202,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},produced epic poetry {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But other causes and particular influences combined
61203,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},to nourish and develop the epic germ of the Sanskrit-Indians. Already in
61204,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"the Rig-veda are found hymns in which the Aryan genius preluded, so to"
61205,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"speak, to the future epopeia, in songs that celebrated the heroic deeds of"
61206,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"Indra, the combats and the victories of the tutelary Gods of the Aryan"
61207,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"races over enemies secret or open, human or superhuman, the exploits and"
61208,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"the memories of ancient heroes. More recently, at certain solemn"
61209,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"occasions, as the very learned A. Weber remarks, at the solemnity, for"
61210,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"example of the Asvamedha or sacrifice of the horse, the praises of the"
61211,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},king who ordained the great rite were sung by bards and minstrels in songs
61212,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"composed for the purpose, the memories of past times were recalled and"
61213,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},honourable mention was made of the just and pious kings of old. In the
61214,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"_Bráhmanas_, a sort of prose commentaries annexed to the Vedas, are found"
61215,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},recorded stories and legends which allude to historical events of the past
61216,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"ages, to ancient memories, and to mythical events. Such popular legends"
61217,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},which the _Bráhmanas_ undoubtedly gathered from tradition admirably suited
61218,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},the epic tissue with which they were interwoven by successive hands.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Many
61219,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"and various mythico-historical traditions, suitable for epic development,"
61220,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"were diffused among the Aryan races, those for example which are related"
61221,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"in the four chapters containing the description of the earth, the Descent"
61222,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"of the Ganges, etc. The epic genius however sometimes created beings of"
61223,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},its own and gave body and life to ideal conceptions. Some of the persons
61224,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"in the Rámáyan must be, in my opinion, either personifications of the"
61225,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},forces of nature like those which are described with such vigour in the
61226,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"_Sháhnámah_, or if not exactly created, exaggerated beyond human"
61227,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"proportions; others, vedic personages much more ancient than Ráma, were"
61228,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"introduced into the epic and woven into its narrations, to bring together"
61229,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"men who lived in different and distant ages, as has been the case in times"
61230,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"nearer to our own, in the epics, I mean, of the middle ages."
61231,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},
61232,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},In the introduction I have discussed the antiquity of the Rámáyan; and by
61233,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},means of those critical and inductive proofs which are all that an
61234,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},antiquity without precise historical dates can furnish I have endeavoured
61235,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"to establish with all the certainty that the subject admitted, that the"
61236,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},original composition of the Rámáyan is to be assigned to about the twelfth
61237,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},century before the Christian era. Not that I believe that the epic then
61238,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"sprang to life in the form in which we now possess it; I think, and I have"
61239,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"elsewhere expressed the opinion, that the poem during the course of its"
61240,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"rhapsodical and oral propagation appropriated by way of episodes,"
61241,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"traditions, legends and ancient myths.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But as far as regards the epic"
61242,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},poem properly so called which celebrates the expedition of Ráma against
61243,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},the Rákshases I think that I have sufficiently shown that its origin and
61244,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},first appearance should be placed about the twelfth century B.C.; nor have
61245,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"I hitherto met with anything to oppose this chronological result, or to"
61246,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},oblige me to rectify or reject it.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But an eminent philologist already
61247,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"quoted, deeply versed in these studies, A. Weber, has expressed in some of"
61248,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"his writings a totally different opinion; and the authority of his name,"
61249,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"if not the number and cogency of his arguments, compels me to say"
61250,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},something on the subject. From the fact or rather the assumption that
61251,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Megasthenes(1184) who lived some time in India has made no mention either
61252,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},of the Mahábhárat or the Rámáyan Professor Weber argues that neither of
61253,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"these poems could have existed at that time; as regards the Rámáyan, the"
61254,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"unity of its composition, the chain that binds together its different"
61255,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"parts, and its allegorical character, show it, says Professor Weber, to be"
61256,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"much more recent than the age to which I have assigned it, near to our own"
61257,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"era, and according to him, later than the Mahábhárat. As for Megasthenes"
61258,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"it should be observed, that he did not write a history of India, much less"
61259,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"a literary history or anything at all resembling one, but a simple"
61260,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"description, in great part physical, of India: whence, from his silence on"
61261,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},literary matters to draw inferences regarding the history of Sanskrit
61262,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},literature would be the same thing as from the silence of a geologist with
61263,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"respect to the literature of a country whose valleys, mountains, and"
61264,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"internal structure he is exploring, to conjecture that such and such a"
61265,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},poem or history not mentioned by him did not exist at his time. We have
61266,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},only to look at the fragments of Megasthenes collected and published by
61267,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Schwanbeck to see what was the nature and scope of his _Indica_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But only
61268,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},a few fragments of Megasthenes are extant; and to pretend that they should
61269,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},be argument and proof enough to judge the antiquity of a poem is to press
61270,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},the laws of criticism too far. To Professor Weber's argument as to the
61271,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"more or less recent age of the Rámáyan from the unity of its composition,"
61272,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"I will make one sole reply, which is that if unity of composition were"
61273,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"really a proof of a more recent age, it would be necessary to reduce by a"
61274,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},thousand years at least the age of Homer and bring him down to the age of
61275,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Augustus and Virgil; for certainly there is much more unity of
61276,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"composition, a greater accord and harmony of parts in the Iliad and the"
61277,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},Odyssey than in the Rámáyan. But in the fine arts perfection is no proof
61278,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},of a recent age: while the experience and the continuous labour of
61279,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},successive ages are necessary to extend and perfect the physical or
61280,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"natural sciences, art which is spontaneous in its nature can produce and"
61281,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},has produced in remote times works of such perfection as later ages have
61282,{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~},"not been able to equal."""

66646,XLV.,in the text which I follow. Vibhishan is kicked from his seat by
66647,XLV.,"Rávan, and then, after telling his mother what has happened, he"
66648,XLV.,"flies to Mount Kailása where he has an interview with Siva, and by"

66681,XLV.,941 According to a Pauranik legend Kesarí Hanumán's putative father had
66682,XLV.,"killed an Asur or demon who appeared in the form of an elephant, and"
66683,XLV.,hence arose the hostility between Vánars and elephants.
66684,XLV.,
66685,XLV.,942 Here follows the enumeration of Sugríva's forces which I do not
66686,XLV.,attempt to follow. It soon reaches a hundred thousand billions.
66687,XLV.,
66688,XLV.,"943 I omit the rest of this canto, which is mere repetition. Rávan gives"
66689,XLV.,"in the same words his former answer that the Gods, Gandharvas and"
66690,XLV.,fiends combined shall not force him to give up Sítá. He then orders
66691,XLV.,Sárdúla to tell him the names of the Vánar chieftains whom he has

66754,XLV.,father.
66755,XLV.,
66756,XLV.,"966 The daughter of King Kusadhwaja. She became an ascetic, and being"
66757,XLV.,"insulted by Rávan in the woods where she was performing penance,"

66759,XLV.,in turn the destruction of him who had insulted her.
66760,XLV.,
66761,XLV.,967 Nandísvara was Siva's chief attendant. Rávan had despised and
66762,XLV.,laughed at him for appearing in the form of a monkey and the
66763,XLV.,irritated Nandísvara cursed him and foretold his destruction by
66764,XLV.,monkeys.
66765,XLV.,
66766,XLV.,968 Rávan once upheaved and shook Mount Kailása the favourite dwelling

66774,XLV.,970 Punjikasthalá was the daughter of Varun. Rávan himself has mentioned

66777,XLV.,
66778,XLV.,971 Pulastya was the son of Brahmá and father of Visravas or Paulastya
66779,XLV.,the father of Rávan and Kumbhakarna.
66780,XLV.,
66781,XLV.,972 I omit a tedious sermon on the danger of rashness and the advantages
66782,XLV.,"of prudence, sufficient to irritate a less passionate hearer than"
66783,XLV.,Rávan.
66784,XLV.,
66785,XLV.,973 The Bengal recension assigns a very different speech to Kumbhakarna
66786,XLV.,and makes him say that Nárad the messenger of the Gods had formerly
66787,XLV.,told him that Vishnu himself incarnate as Dasaratha's son should
66788,XLV.,come to destroy Rávan.
66789,XLV.,

66791,XLV.,

66793,XLV.,
66794,XLV.,976 There is so much commonplace repetition in these Sallies of the
66795,XLV.,Rákshas chieftains that omissions are frequently necessary. The
66796,XLV.,"usual ill omens attend the sally of Kumbhakarna, and the Canto ends"
66797,XLV.,with a description of the terrified Vánars' flight which is briefly
66798,XLV.,repeated in different words at the beginning of the next Canto.
66799,XLV.,

66801,XLV.,"are said to have cut a passage through the mountain Krauncha, a part"

66823,XLV.,"983 I have abridged this long Canto by omitting some vain repetitions,"
66824,XLV.,commonplace epithets and similes and other unimportant matter. There
66825,XLV.,are many verses in this Canto which European scholars would rigidly
66826,XLV.,exclude as unmistakeably the work of later rhapsodists. Even the
66827,XLV.,reverent Commentator whom I follow ventures to remark once or twice:

66855,XLV.,
66856,XLV.,993 The Lokapálas are sometimes regarded as deities appointed by Brahmá
66857,XLV.,at the creation of the word to act as guardians of different orders
66858,XLV.,"of beings, but more commonly they are identified with the deities"
66859,XLV.,presiding over the four cardinal and four intermediate points of the
66860,XLV.,"compass, which, according to Manu V. 96, are 1, Indra, guardian of"

66867,XLV.,hundred and fifty million in number with three hundred million

66869,XLV.,"are merely said to have been ""unnumbered."""
66870,XLV.,
66871,XLV.,995 It is not very easy to see the advantage of having arrows headed in
66872,XLV.,the way mentioned. Fanciful names for war-engines and weapons
66873,XLV.,derived from their resemblance to various animals are not confined
66874,XLV.,"to India. The ""War-wolf"" was used by Edward I. at the siege of"

66879,XLV.,
66880,XLV.,997 This exploit of Hanumán is related with inordinate prolixity in the
66881,XLV.,Bengal recension (Gortesio's text). Among other adventures he
66882,XLV.,narrowly escapes being shot by Bharat as he passes over Nandigrama
66883,XLV.,"near Ayodhyá. Hanumán stays Bharat in time, and gives him an account"
