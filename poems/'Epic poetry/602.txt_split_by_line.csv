28,,"Roman poet Lucan, and probably left unfinished upon his death in"
29,,A.D. 65.  Although the work has been generally known through most
30,,"of history as the ""Pharsalia"", modern scholarship tends to agree"
31,,that this was not Lucan's choice for a title.

42,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON
43,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
44,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
45,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Wars worse than civil on Emathian (1) plains,"
46,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And crime let loose we sing; how Rome's high race
47,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Plunged in her vitals her victorious sword;
48,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Armies akin embattled, with the force"
49,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of all the shaken earth bent on the fray;
50,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And burst asunder, to the common guilt,"
51,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"A kingdom's compact; eagle with eagle met,"
52,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Standard to standard, spear opposed to spear."
53,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
54,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Whence, citizens, this rage, this boundless lust"
55,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To sate barbarians with the blood of Rome?
56,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Did not the shade of Crassus, wandering still, (2)"
57,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Cry for his vengeance?  Could ye not have spoiled,"
58,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To deck your trophies, haughty Babylon?"
59,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Why wage campaigns that send no laurels home?
60,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"What lands, what oceans might have been the prize"
61,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of all the blood thus shed in civil strife!
62,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Where Titan rises, where night hides the stars,"
63,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"'Neath southern noons all quivering with heat,"
64,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Or where keen frost that never yields to spring
65,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In icy fetters binds the Scythian main:
66,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Long since barbarians by the Eastern sea
67,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And far Araxes' stream, and those who know"
68,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,(If any such there be) the birth of Nile
69,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Had felt our yoke.  Then, Rome, upon thyself"
70,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With all the world beneath thee, if thou must,"
71,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Wage this nefarious war, but not till then."
72,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
73,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Now view the houses with half-ruined walls
74,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Throughout Italian cities; stone from stone
75,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Has slipped and lies at length; within the home
76,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No guard is found, and in the ancient streets so"
77,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Scarce seen the passer by.  The fields in vain,"
78,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Rugged with brambles and unploughed for years,"
79,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Ask for the hand of man; for man is not.
80,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nor savage Pyrrhus nor the Punic horde
81,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,E'er caused such havoc: to no foe was given
82,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To strike thus deep; but civil strife alone
83,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Dealt the fell wound and left the death behind.
84,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Yet if the fates could find no other way (3)
85,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"For Nero coming, nor the gods with ease"
86,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Gain thrones in heaven; and if the Thunderer
87,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Prevailed not till the giant's war was done,"
88,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Complaint is silent.  For this boon supreme
89,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Welcome, ye gods, be wickedness and crime;"
90,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thronged with our dead be dire Pharsalia's fields,"
91,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Be Punic ghosts avenged by Roman blood;
92,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Add to these ills the toils of Mutina;
93,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Perusia's dearth; on Munda's final field
94,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The shock of battle joined; let Leucas' Cape
95,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shatter the routed navies; servile hands
96,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Unsheath the sword on fiery Etna's slopes:
97,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Still Rome is gainer by the civil war.
98,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thou, Caesar, art her prize.  When thou shalt choose,"
99,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thy watch relieved, to seek divine abodes,"
100,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"All heaven rejoicing; and shalt hold a throne,"
101,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Or else elect to govern Phoebus' car
102,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And light a subject world that shall not dread
103,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To owe her brightness to a different Sun;
104,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"All shall concede thy right: do what thou wilt,"
105,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Select thy Godhead, and the central clime"
106,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Whence thou shalt rule the world with power divine.
107,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And yet the Northern or the Southern Pole
108,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"We pray thee, choose not; but in rays direct"
109,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Vouchsafe thy radiance to thy city Rome.
110,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Press thou on either side, the universe"
111,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Should lose its equipoise: take thou the midst,"
112,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And weight the scales, and let that part of heaven"
113,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Where Caesar sits, be evermore serene"
114,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And smile upon us with unclouded blue.
115,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Then may all men lay down their arms, and peace"
116,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Through all the nations reign, and shut the gates"
117,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That close the temple of the God of War.
118,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Be thou my help, to me e'en now divine!"
119,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Let Delphi's steep her own Apollo guard,"
120,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And Nysa keep her Bacchus, uninvoked."
121,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Rome is my subject and my muse art thou!
122,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
123,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,First of such deeds I purpose to unfold
124,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The causes -- task immense -- what drove to arms
125,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"A maddened nation, and from all the world"
126,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Struck peace away.
127,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
128,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,By envious fate's decrees
129,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Abide not long the mightiest lords of earth;
130,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Beneath too heavy a burden great the fall.
131,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thus Rome o'ergrew her strength.  So when that hour,"
132,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The last in all the centuries, shall sound"
133,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The world's disruption, all things shall revert"
134,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To that primaeval chaos, stars on stars"
135,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall crash; and fiery meteors from the sky
136,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Plunge in the ocean.  Earth shall then no more
137,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Front with her bulwark the encroaching sea:
138,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The moon, indignant at her path oblique,"
139,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall drive her chariot 'gainst her brother Sun
140,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And claim the day for hers; and discord huge
141,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall rend the spheres asunder.
142,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,On themselves
143,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Great powers are dashed: such bounds the gods have placed
144,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Upon the prosperous; nor doth Fortune lend
145,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To any nations, so that they may strike"
146,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The sovereign power that rules the earth and sea,"
147,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The weapons of her envy.  Triple reign
148,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And baleful compact for divided power --
149,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Ne'er without peril separate before --
150,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Made Rome their victim.  Oh!  Ambition blind,"
151,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That stirred the leaders so to join their strength
152,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"In peace that ended ill, their prize the world!"
153,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,For while the Sea on Earth and Earth on Air
154,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Lean for support: while Titan runs his course,"
155,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And night with day divides an equal sphere,"
156,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No king shall brook his fellow, nor shall power"
157,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Endure a rival.  Search no foreign lands:
158,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,These walls are proof that in their infant days
159,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"A hamlet, not the world, was prize enough"
160,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To cause the shedding of a brother's blood.
161,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
162,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Concord, on discord based, brief time endured,"
163,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Unwelcome to the rivals; and alone
164,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Crassus delayed the advent of the war.
165,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Like to the slender neck that separates
166,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The seas of Graecia: should it be engulfed
167,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Then would th' Ionian and Aegean mains (4)
168,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Break each on other: thus when Crassus fell,"
169,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Who held apart the chiefs, in piteous death,"
170,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And stained Assyria's plains with Latian blood,"
171,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Defeat in Parthia loosed the war in Rome.
172,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"More in that victory than ye thought was won,"
173,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Ye sons of Arsaces; your conquered foes
174,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Took at your hands the rage of civil strife.
175,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The mighty realm that earth and sea contained,"
176,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To which all peoples bowed, split by the sword,"
177,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Could not find space for two (5).  For Julia bore,"
178,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Cut off by fate unpitying(6), the bond"
179,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of that ill-omened marriage, and the pledge"
180,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of blood united, to the shades below."
181,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Had'st thou but longer stayed, it had been thine"
182,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To keep the husband and the sire apart,"
183,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And, as the Sabine women did of old,"
184,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Dash down the threatening swords and join the hands.
185,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With thee all trust was buried, and the chiefs"
186,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Could give their courage vent, and rushed to war."
187,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
188,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Lest newer glories triumphs past obscure,"
189,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Late conquered Gaul the bays from pirates won,"
190,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"This, Magnus, was thy fear; thy roll of fame,"
191,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of glorious deeds accomplished for the state
192,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Allows no equal; nor will Caesar's pride
193,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,A prior rival in his triumphs brook;
194,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Which had the right 'twere impious to enquire;
195,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Each for his cause can vouch a judge supreme;
196,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The victor, heaven: the vanquished, Cato, thee. (7)"
197,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nor were they like to like: the one in years
198,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Now verging towards decay, in times of peace"
199,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Had unlearned war; but thirsting for applause
200,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Had given the people much, and proud of fame"
201,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"His former glory cared not to renew,"
202,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"But joyed in plaudits of the theatre, (8)"
203,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"His gift to Rome: his triumphs in the past,"
204,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Himself the shadow of a mighty name.
205,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"As when some oak, in fruitful field sublime,"
206,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Adorned with venerable spoils, and gifts"
207,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of bygone leaders, by its weight to earth"
208,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With feeble roots still clings; its naked arms
209,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And hollow trunk, though leafless, give a shade;"
210,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And though condemned beneath the tempest's shock
211,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To speedy fall, amid the sturdier trees"
212,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In sacred grandeur rules the forest still.
213,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No such repute had Ceesar won, nor fame;"
214,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But energy was his that could not rest --
215,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The only shame he knew was not to win.
216,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Keen and unvanquished (9), where revenge or hope"
217,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Might call, resistless would he strike the blow"
218,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With sword unpitying: every victory won
219,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Reaped to the full; the favour of the gods
220,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Pressed to the utmost; all that stayed his course
221,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Aimed at the summit of power, was thrust aside:"
222,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Triumph his joy, though ruin marked his track."
223,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"As parts the clouds a bolt by winds compelled,"
224,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With crack of riven air and crash of worlds,"
225,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And veils the light of day, and on mankind,"
226,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Blasting their vision with its flames oblique,"
227,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Sheds deadly fright; then turning to its home, '"
228,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nought but the air opposing, through its path"
229,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Spreads havoc, and collects its scattered fires."
230,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
231,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Such were the hidden motives of the chiefs;
232,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But in the public life the seeds of war
233,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Their hold had taken, such as are the doom"
234,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of potent nations: and when fortune poured
235,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Through Roman gates the booty of a world,"
236,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The curse of luxury, chief bane of states,"
237,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Fell on her sons.  Farewell the ancient ways!
238,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Behold the pomp profuse, the houses decked"
239,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With ornament; their hunger loathed the food
240,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of former days; men wore attire for dames
241,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Scarce fitly fashioned; poverty was scorned,"
242,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Fruitful of warriors; and from all the world
243,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Came that which ruins nations; while the fields
244,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Furrowed of yore by great Camillus' plough,"
245,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Or by the mattock which a Curius held,"
246,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Lost their once narrow bounds, and widening tracts"
247,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,By hinds unknown were tilled.  No nation this
248,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To sheathe the sword, with tranquil peace content"
249,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And with her liberties; but prone to ire;
250,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Crime holding light as though by want compelled:
251,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And great the glory in the minds of men,"
252,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Ambition lawful even at point of sword,"
253,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To rise above their country: might their law:
254,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Decrees are forced from Senate and from Plebs:
255,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Consul and Tribune break the laws alike:
256,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Bought are the fasces, and the people sell"
257,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,For gain their favour: bribery's fatal curse
258,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Corrupts the annual contests of the Field.
259,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Then covetous usury rose, and interest"
260,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Was greedier ever as the seasons came;
261,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Faith tottered; thousands saw their gain in war.
262,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
263,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Caesar has crossed the Alps, his mighty soul"
264,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Great tumults pondering and the coming shock.
265,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Now on the marge of Rubicon, he saw,"
266,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"In face most sorrowful and ghostly guise,"
267,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,His trembling country's image; huge it seemed
268,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Through mists of night obscure; and hoary hair
269,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Streamed from the lofty front with turrets crowned:
270,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Torn were her locks and naked were her arms.
271,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Then thus, with broken sighs the Vision spake:"
272,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"""What seek ye, men of Rome?  and whither hence"
273,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Bear ye my standards?  If by right ye come,"
274,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"My citizens, stay here; these are the bounds;"
275,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No further dare.""  But Caesar's hair was stiff"
276,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With horror as he gazed, and ghastly dread"
277,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Restrained his footsteps on the further bank.
278,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Then spake he, ""Thunderer, who from the rock"
279,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Tarpeian seest the wall of mighty Rome;
280,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Gods of my race who watched o'er Troy of old;
281,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thou Jove of Alba's height, and Vestal fires,"
282,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And rites of Romulus erst rapt to heaven,"
283,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And God-like Rome; be friendly to my quest.
284,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Not with offence or hostfie arms I come,"
285,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thy Caesar, conqueror by land and sea,"
286,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Thy soldier here and wheresoe'er thou wilt:
287,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No other's; his, his only be the guilt"
288,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Whose acts make me thy foe.'  He gives the word
289,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And bids his standards cross the swollen stream.
290,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,So in the wastes of Afric's burning clime
291,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The lion crouches as his foes draw near,"
292,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Feeding his wrath the while, his lashing tail"
293,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Provokes his fury; stiff upon his neck
294,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Bristles his mane: deep from his gaping jaws
295,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Resounds a muttered growl, and should a lance"
296,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Or javelin reach him from the hunter's ring,"
297,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Scorning the puny scratch he bounds afield.
298,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
299,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,From modest fountain blood-red Rubicon
300,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In summer's heat flows on; his pigmy tide
301,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Creeps through the valleys and with slender marge
302,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Divides the Italian peasant from the Gaul.
303,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Then winter gave him strength, and fraught with rain"
304,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The third day's crescent moon; while Eastern winds
305,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Thawed from the Alpine slopes the yielding snow.
306,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The cavalry first form across the stream '
307,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To break the torrent's force; the rest with ease
308,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Beneath their shelter gain the further bank.
309,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,When Csesar crossed and trod beneath his feet
310,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The soil of Italy's forbidden fields,"
311,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"""Here,"" spake he, ""peace, here broken laws be left;"
312,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Farewell to treaties.  Fortune, lead me on;"
313,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"War is our judge, and in the fates our trust."""
314,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Then in the shades of night he leads the troops
315,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Swifter than Balearic sling or shaft
316,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Winged by retreating Parthian, to the walls"
317,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of threatened Rimini, while fled the stars,"
318,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Save Lucifer, before the coming sun,"
319,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Whose fires were veiled in clouds, by south wind driven,"
320,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Or else at heaven's command: and thus drew on
321,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The first dark morning of the civil war.
322,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
323,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Now stand the troops within the captured town,"
324,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Their standards planted; and the trumpet clang
325,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Rings forth in harsh alarums, giving note"
326,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of impious strife: roused from their sleep the men
327,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Rush to the hall and snatch the ancient arms
328,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Long hanging through the years of peace; the shield
329,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With crumbling frame; dark with the tooth of rust
330,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Their swords (10); and javelins with blunted point.
331,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"But when the well-known signs and eagles shone,"
332,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And Caesar towering o'er the throng was seen,"
333,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"They shook for terror, fear possessed their limbs,"
334,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And thoughts unuttered stirred within their souls.
335,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"""O miserable those to whom their home"
336,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Denies the peace that all men else enjoy!
337,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Placed as we are beside the Northern bounds
338,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And scarce a footstep from the restless Gaul,"
339,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,We fall the first; would that our lot had been
340,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Beneath the Eastern sky, or frozen North,"
341,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To lead a wandering life, rather than keep"
342,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The gates of Latium.  Brennus sacked the town
343,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And Hannibal, and all the Teuton hosts."
344,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,For when the fate of Rome is in the scale
345,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"By this path war advances.""  Thus they moan"
346,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Their fears but speak them not; no sound is heard
347,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Giving their anguish utterance: as when
348,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"In depth of winter all the fields are still,"
349,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The birds are voiceless and no sound is heard
350,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To break the silence of the central sea.
351,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But when the day had broken through the shades
352,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of chilly darkness, lo!  the torch of war!"
353,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,For by the hand of Fate is swift dispersed
354,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"All Caesar's shame of battle, and his mind"
355,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Scarce doubted more; and Fortune toiled to make
356,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,His action just and give him cause for arms.
357,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,For while Rome doubted and the tongues of men
358,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Spoke of the chiefs who won them rights of yore,"
359,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The hostile Senate, in contempt of right,"
360,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Drove out the Tribunes.  They to Caesar's camp
361,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With Curio hasten, who of venal tongue,"
362,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Bold, prompt, persuasive, had been wont to preach"
363,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of Freedom to the people, and to call"
364,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Upon the chiefs to lay their weapons down (11).
365,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And when he saw how deeply Caesar mused,"
366,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"""While from the rostrum I had power,"" he said,"
367,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To call the populace to aid thy cause,"
368,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,By this my voice against the Senate's will
369,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Was thy command prolonged.  But silenced now
370,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Are laws in war: we driven from our homes;
371,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Yet is our exile willing; for thine arms
372,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall make us citizens of Rome again.
373,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Strike; for no strength as yet the foe hath gained.
374,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Occasion calls, delay shall mar it soon:"
375,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Like risk, like labour, thou hast known before,"
376,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But never such reward.  Could Gallia hold
377,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Thine armies ten long years ere victory came,"
378,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That little nook of earth?  One paltry fight
379,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Or twain, fought out by thy resistless hand,"
380,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And Rome for thee shall have subdued the world:
381,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,'Tis true no triumph now would bring thee home;
382,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,No captive tribes would grace thy chariot wheels
383,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Winding in pomp around the ancient hill.
384,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Spite gnaws the factions; for thy conquests won
385,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Scarce shalt thou be unpunished.  Yet 'tis fate
386,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Thou should'st subdue thy kinsman: share the world
387,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With him thou canst not; rule thou canst, alone."""
388,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,As when at Elis' festival a horse
389,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In stable pent gnaws at his prison bars
390,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Impatient, and should clamour from without"
391,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Strike on his ear, bounds furious at restraint,"
392,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"So then was Caesar, eager for the fight,"
393,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Stirred by the words of Curio.  To the ranks
394,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,He bids his soldiers; with majestic mien
395,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And hand commanding silence as they come.
396,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"""Comrades,"" he cried, ""victorious returned,"
397,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Who by my side for ten long years have faced,"
398,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"'Mid Alpine winters and on Arctic shores,"
399,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The thousand dangers of the battle-field --
400,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Is this our country's welcome, this her prize"
401,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,For death and wounds and Roman blood outpoured?
402,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Rome arms her choicest sons; the sturdy oaks
403,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Are felled to make a fleet; -- what could she more
404,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,If from the Alps fierce Hannibal were come
405,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With all his Punic host?  By land and sea
406,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Caesar shall fly!  Fly?  Though in adverse war
407,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Our best had fallen, and the savage Gaul"
408,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Were hard upon our track, we would not fly."
409,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And now, when fortune smiles and kindly gods"
410,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Beckon us on to glory! -- Let him come
411,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Fresh from his years of peace, with all his crowd"
412,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of conscript burgesses, Marcellus' tongue (12)"
413,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And Cato's empty name!  We will not fly.
414,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall Eastern hordes and greedy hirelings keep
415,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Their loved Pompeius ever at the helm?
416,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall chariots of triumph be for him
417,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Though youth and law forbad them?  Shall he seize
418,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,On Rome's chief honours ne'er to be resigned?
419,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And what of harvests (13) blighted through the world
420,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And ghastly famine made to serve his ends?
421,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Who hath forgotten how Pompeius' bands
422,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Seized on the forum, and with glittering arms"
423,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Made outraged justice tremble, while their swords"
424,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Hemmed in the judgment-seat where Milo (14) stood?
425,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And now when worn and old and ripe for rest (15),"
426,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Greedy of power, the impious sword again"
427,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,He draws.  As tigers in Hyrcanian woods
428,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Wandering, or in the caves that saw their birth,"
429,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Once having lapped the blood of slaughtered kine,"
430,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall never cease from rage; e'en so this whelp
431,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of cruel Sulla, nursed in civil war,"
432,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Outstrips his master; and the tongue which licked
433,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That reeking weapon ever thirsts for more.
434,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Stain once the lips with blood, no other meal"
435,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,They shall enjoy.  And shall there be no end
436,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of these long years of power and of crime?
437,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nay, this one lesson, e'er it be too late,"
438,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Learn of thy gentle Sulla -- to retire!
439,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of old his victory o'er Cilician thieves
440,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And Pontus' weary monarch gave him fame,"
441,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,By poison scarce attained.  His latest prize
442,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Shall I be, Caesar, I, who would not quit"
443,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,My conquering eagles at his proud command?
444,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nay, if no triumph is reserved for me,"
445,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Let these at least of long and toilsome war
446,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,'Neath other leaders the rewards enjoy.
447,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Where shall the weary soldier find his rest?
448,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"What cottage homes their joys, what fields their fruit"
449,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shall to our veterans yield?  Will Magnus say
450,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That pirates only till the fields alight?
451,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Unfurl your standards; victory gilds them yet,"
452,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,As through those glorious years.  Deny our rights!
453,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,He that denies them makes our quarrel just.
454,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nay!  use the strength that we have made our own.
455,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No booty seek we, nor imperial power."
456,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,This would-be ruler of subservient Rome
457,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,We force to quit his grasp; and Heaven shall smile
458,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"On those who seek to drag the tyrant down."""
459,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
460,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Thus Caesar spake; but doubtful murmurs ran
461,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Throughout the listening crowd, this way and that"
462,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Their wishes urging them; the thoughts of home
463,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And household gods and kindred gave them pause:
464,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But fear of Caesar and the pride of war
465,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Their doubts resolved.  Then Laelius, who wore"
466,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The well-earned crown for Roman life preserved,"
467,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The foremost Captain of the army, spake:"
468,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"""O greatest leader of the Roman name,"
469,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,If 'tis thy wish the very truth to hear
470,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"'Tis mine to speak it; we complain of this,"
471,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That gifted with such strength thou did'st refrain
472,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,From using it.  Had'st thou no trust in us?
473,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"While the hot life-blood fills these glowing veins,"
474,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"While these strong arms avail to hurl the lance,"
475,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Wilt thou make peace and bear the Senate's rule?
476,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Is civil conquest then so base and vile?
477,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Lead us through Scythian deserts, lead us where"
478,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The inhospitable Syrtes line the shore
479,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of Afric's burning sands, or where thou wilt:"
480,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"This hand, to leave a conquered world behind,"
481,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Held firm the oar that tamed the Northern Sea
482,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And Rhine's swift torrent foaming to the main.
483,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To follow thee fate gives me now the power:
484,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The will was mine before.  No citizen
485,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,I count the man 'gainst whom thy trumpets sound.
486,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"By ten campaigns of victory, I swear,"
487,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"By all thy world-wide triumphs, though with hand"
488,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Unwilling, should'st thou now demand the life"
489,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of sire or brother or of faithful spouse,"
490,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Caesar, the life were thine.  To spoil the gods"
491,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And sack great Juno's temple on the hill,"
492,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To plant our arms o'er Tiber's yellow stream,"
493,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To measure out the camp, against the wall"
494,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"To drive the fatal ram, and raze the town,"
495,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"This arm shall not refuse, though Rome the prize."""
496,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
497,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,His comrades swore consent with lifted hands
498,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And vowed to follow wheresoe'er he led.
499,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And such a clamour rent the sky as when
500,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Some Thracian blast on Ossa's pine-clad rocks
501,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Falls headlong, and the loud re-echoing woods,"
502,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Or bending, or rebounding from the stroke,"
503,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In sounding chorus lift the roar on high.
504,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
505,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,When Csesar saw them welcome thus the war
506,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And Fortune leading on, and favouring fates,"
507,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"He seized the moment, called his troops from Gaul,"
508,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And breaking up his camp set on for Rome.
509,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
510,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The tents are vacant by Lake Leman's side;
511,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The camps upon the beetling crags of Vosges
512,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No longer hold the warlike Lingon down,"
513,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Fierce in his painted arms; Isere is left,"
514,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Who past his shallows gliding, flows at last"
515,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Into the current of more famous Rhone,"
516,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To reach the ocean in another name.
517,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The fair-haired people of Cevennes are free:
518,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Soft Aude rejoicing bears no Roman keel,"
519,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nor pleasant Var, since then Italia's bound;"
520,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The harbour sacred to Alcides' name
521,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Where hollow crags encroach upon the sea,"
522,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Is left in freedom: there nor Zephyr gains
523,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nor Caurus access, but the Circian blast (16)"
524,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Forbids the roadstead by Monaecus' hold.
525,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And others left the doubtful shore, which sea"
526,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And land alternate claim, whene'er the tide"
527,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Pours in amain or when the wave rolls back --
528,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Be it the wind which thus compels the deep
529,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"From furthest pole, and leaves it at the flood;"
530,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Or else the moon that makes the tide to swell,"
531,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Or else, in search of fuel (17) for his fires,"
532,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The sun draws heavenward the ocean wave; --
533,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Whate'er the cause that may control the main
534,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,I leave to others; let the gods for me
535,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Lock in their breasts the secrets of the world.
536,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
537,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Those who kept watch beside the western shore
538,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Have moved their standards home; the happy Gaul
539,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Rejoices in their absence; fair Garonne
540,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Through peaceful meads glides onward to the sea.
541,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And where the river broadens, neath the cape"
542,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Her quiet harbour sleeps.  No outstretched arm
543,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Except in mimic war now hurls the lance.
544,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,No skilful warrior of Seine directs
545,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The scythed chariot 'gainst his country's foe.
546,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Now rest the Belgians, and the Arvernian race"
547,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That boasts our kinship by descent from Troy;
548,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And those brave rebels whose undaunted hands
549,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Were dipped in Cotta's blood, and those who wear"
550,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Sarmatian garb.  Batavia's warriors fierce
551,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No longer listen for the bugle call,"
552,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nor those who dwell where Rhone's swift eddies sweep
553,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Saone to the ocean; nor the mountain tribes
554,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Who dwell about its source.  Thou, too, oh Treves,"
555,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Rejoicest that the war has left thy bounds.
556,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Ligurian tribes, now shorn, in ancient days"
557,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"First of the long-haired nations, on whose necks"
558,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Once flowed the auburn locks in pride supreme;
559,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And those who pacify with blood accursed
560,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Savage Teutates, Hesus' horrid shrines,"
561,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And Taranis' altars cruel as were those
562,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Loved by Diana (18), goddess of the north;"
563,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"All these now rest in peace.  And you, ye Bards,"
564,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Whose martial lays send down to distant times
565,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The fame of valorous deeds in battle done,"
566,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Pour forth in safety more abundant song.
567,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"While you, ye Druids (19), when the war was done,"
568,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To mysteries strange and hateful rites returned:
569,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To you alone 'tis given the gods and stars
570,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To know or not to know; secluded groves
571,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Your dwelling-place, and forests far remote."
572,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"If what ye sing be true, the shades of men"
573,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Seek not the dismal homes of Erebus
574,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Or death's pale kingdoms; but the breath of life
575,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Still rules these bodies in another age --
576,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Life on this hand and that, and death between."
577,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Happy the peoples 'neath the Northern Star
578,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In this their false belief; for them no fear
579,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of that which frights all others: they with hands
580,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And hearts undaunted rush upon the foe
581,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And scorn to spare the life that shall return.
582,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Ye too depart who kept the banks of Rhine
583,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Safe from the foe, and leave the Teuton tribes"
584,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Free at their will to march upon the world.
585,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
586,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Caesar, with strength increased and gathered troops"
587,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"New efforts daring, spreads his bands afar"
588,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Through Italy, and fills the neighbouring towns."
589,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Then empty rumour to well-grounded fear
590,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Gave strength, and heralding the coming war"
591,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In hundred voices 'midst the people spread.
592,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"One cries in terror, ""Swift the squadrons come"
593,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Where Nar with Tiber joins: and where, in meads"
594,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"By oxen loved, Mevania spreads her walls,"
595,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Fierce Caesar hurries his barbarian horse.
596,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Eagles and standards wave above his head,"
597,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And broad the march that sweeps across the land."""
598,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nor is he pictured truly; greater far
599,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,More fierce and pitiless -- from conquered foes
600,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Advancing; in his rear the peoples march.
601,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Snatched from their homes between the Rhine and Alps,"
602,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To pillage Rome while Roman chiefs look on.
603,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Thus each man's panic thought swells rumour's lie:
604,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,They fear the phantoms they themselves create.
605,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nor does the terror seize the crowd alone:
606,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"But fled the Fathers, to the Consuls (20) first"
607,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Issuing their hated order, as for war;"
608,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And doubting of their safety, doubting too"
609,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Where lay the peril, through the choking gates,"
610,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Each where he would, rushed all the people forth."
611,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Thou would'st believe that blazing to the torch
612,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Were men's abodes, or nodding to their fall."
613,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"So streamed they onwards, frenzied with affright,"
614,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,As though in exile only could they find
615,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Hope for their country.  So, when southern blasts"
616,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"From Libyan whirlpools drive the boundless main,"
617,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And mast and sail crash down upon a ship
618,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With ponderous weight, but still the frame is sound,"
619,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Her crew and captain leap into the sea,"
620,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Each making shipwreck for himself. 'Twas thus
621,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,They passed the city gates and fled to war.
622,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,No aged parent now could stay his son;
623,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nor wife her spouse, nor did they pray the gods"
624,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To grant the safety of their fatherland.
625,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,None linger on the threshold for a look
626,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Of their loved city, though perchance the last."
627,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
628,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Ye gods, who lavish priceless gifts on men,"
629,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Nor care to guard them, see victorious Rome"
630,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Teeming with life, chief city of the world,"
631,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"With ample walls that all mankind might hold,"
632,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To coming Caesar left an easy prey.
633,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The Roman soldier, when in foreign lands"
634,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Pressed by the enemy, in narrow trench"
635,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And hurried mound finds guard enough to make
636,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"His slumber safe; but thou, imperial Rome,"
637,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Alone on rumour of advancing foes
638,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Art left a desert, and thy battlements"
639,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,They trust not for one night.  Yet for their fear
640,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,This one excuse was left; Pompeius fled.
641,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Nor found they room for hope; for nature gave
642,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Unerring portents of worse ills to come.
643,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The angry gods filled earth and air and sea
644,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With frequent prodigies; in darkest nights
645,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Strange constellations sparkled through the gloom:
646,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The pole was all afire, and torches flew"
647,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Across the depths of heaven; with horrid hair
648,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,A blazing comet stretched from east to west
649,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And threatened change to kingdoms.  From the blue
650,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Pale lightning flashed, and in the murky air"
651,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The fire took divers shapes; a lance afar
652,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Would seem to quiver or a misty torch;
653,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,A noiseless thunderbolt from cloudless sky
654,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Rushed down, and drawing fire in northern parts"
655,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Plunged on the summit of the Alban mount.
656,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The stars that run their courses in the night
657,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Shone in full daylight; and the orbed moon,"
658,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Hid by the shade of earth, grew pale and wan."
659,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The sun himself, when poised in mid career,"
660,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Shrouded his burning car in blackest gloom
661,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And plunged the world in darkness, so that men"
662,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Despaired of day -- like as he veiled his light
663,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,From that fell banquet which Mycenae saw (21).
664,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The jaws of Etna were agape with flame
665,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"That rose not heavenwards, but headlong fell"
666,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In smoking stream upon the Italian flank.
667,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Then black Charybdis, from her boundless depth,"
668,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Threw up a gory sea.  In piteous tones
669,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Howled the wild dogs; the Vestal fire was snatched
670,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,From off the altar; and the flame that crowned
671,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The Latin festival was split in twain,"
672,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"As on the Theban pyre (22), in ancient days;"
673,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Earth tottered on its base: the mighty Alps
674,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,From off their summits shook th' eternal snow (23).
675,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,In huge upheaval Ocean raised his waves
676,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,O'er Calpe's rock and Atlas' hoary head.
677,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The native gods shed tears, and holy sweat"
678,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Dropped from the idols; gifts in temples fell:
679,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Foul birds defiled the day; beasts left the woods
680,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And made their lair among the streets of Rome.
681,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,All this we hear; nay more: dumb oxen spake;
682,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Monsters were brought to birth and mothers shrieked
683,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,At their own offspring; words of dire import
684,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,From Cumae's prophetess were noised abroad.

688,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Arms clashed; and sounding in the pathless woods
689,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Were heard strange voices; spirits walked the earth:
690,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And dead men's ashes muttered from the urn.
691,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Those who live near the walls desert their homes,"
692,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"For lo!  with hissing serpents in her hair,"
693,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Waving in downward whirl a blazing pine,"

697,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"From Hades seen, at haughty Juno's word,"
698,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Brought terror to the soul of Hercules.
699,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Trumpets like those that summon armies forth
700,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Were heard re-echoing in the silent night:
701,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And from the earth arising Sulla's (25) ghost
702,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Sang gloomy oracles, and by Anio's wave"
703,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"All fled the homesteads, frighted by the shade"
704,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of Marius waking from his broken tomb.
705,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
706,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"In such dismay they summon, as of yore,"
707,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The Tuscan sages to the nation's aid.
708,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Aruns, the eldest, leaving his abode"

716,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Each trembling citizen in turn proceeds.
717,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The priests, chief guardians of the public faith,"
718,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,With holy sprinkling purge the open space
719,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,That borders on the wall; in sacred garb

722,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,To whom alone is given the right to see
723,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Minerva's effigy that came from Troy (27).
724,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Next come the keepers of the sacred books
725,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And fate's predictions; who from Almo's brook
726,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Bring back Cybebe laved; the augur too
727,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Taught to observe sinister flight of birds;
728,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And those who serve the banquets to the gods;
729,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And Titian brethren; and the priest of Mars,"

739,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Spreads on his brow the meal, and pours the wine."
740,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The victim's struggles prove the gods averse;
741,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But when the servers press upon his horns
742,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,
743,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,He bends the knee and yields him to the blow.
744,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"No crimson torrent issued at the stroke,"
745,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,But from the wound a dark empoisoned stream
746,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Ebbed slowly downward.  Aruns at the sight
747,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Aghast, upon the entrails of the beast"
748,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Essayed to read the anger of the gods.
749,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Their very colour terrified the seer;
750,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"Spotted they were and pale, with sable streaks"
751,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Of lukewarm gore bespread; the liver damp

754,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The fibre hid, and through the vital parts"
755,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,The membrane small; the heart had ceased to throb;
756,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,Blood oozes through the ducts; the caul is split:
757,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"And, fatal omen of impending ill,"
758,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,One lobe o'ergrows the other; of the twain
759,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,"The one lies flat and sick, the other beats"
760,THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON,And keeps the pulse in rapid strokes astir.

1018,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The matrons laid aside their wonted garb:
1019,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Crowds filled the temples -- on the unpitying stones
1020,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Some dashed their bosoms; others bathed with tears
1021,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The statues of the gods; some tore their hair
1022,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Upon the holy threshold, and with shrieks"
1023,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And vows unceasing called upon the names
1024,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of those whom mortals supplicate.  Nor all
1025,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Lay in the Thunderer's fane: at every shrine
1026,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Some prayers are offered which refused shall bring
1027,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Reproach on heaven.  One whose livid arms
1028,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Were dark with blows, whose cheeks with tears bedewed"
1029,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And riven, cried, ""Beat, mothers, beat the breast,"
1030,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Tear now the lock; while doubtful in the scales
1031,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Still fortune hangs, nor yet the fight is won,"
1032,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"You still may grieve: when either wins rejoice."""
1033,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thus sorrow stirs itself.
1034,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1035,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Meanwhile the men
1036,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Seeking the camp and setting forth to war,"
1037,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Address the cruel gods in just complaint.
1038,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""Happy the youths who born in Punic days"
1039,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,On Cannae's uplands or by Trebia's stream
1040,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Fought and were slain!  What wretched lot is ours!
1041,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No peace we ask for: let the nations rage;
1042,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Rouse fiercest cities!  may the world find arms
1043,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To wage a war with Rome: let Parthian hosts
1044,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Rush forth from Susa; Scythian Ister curb
1045,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No more the Massagete: unconquered Rhine
1046,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Let loose from furthest North her fair-haired tribes:
1047,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Elbe, pour thy Suevians forth!  Let us be foes"
1048,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of all the peoples.  May the Getan press
1049,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Here, and the Dacian there; Pompeius meet"
1050,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The Eastern archers, Caesar in the West"
1051,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Confront th' Iberian.  Leave to Rome no hand
1052,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To raise against herself in civil strife.
1053,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Or, if Italia by the gods be doomed,"
1054,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Let all the sky, fierce Parent, be dissolved"
1055,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And falling on the earth in flaming bolts,"
1056,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Their hands still bloodless, strike both leaders down,"
1057,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,With both their hosts!  Why plunge in novel crime
1058,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To settle which of them shall rule in Rome?
1059,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Scarce were it worth the price of civil war
1060,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To hinder either.""  Thus the patriot voice"
1061,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Still found an utterance, soon to speak no more."
1062,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1063,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Meantime, the aged fathers o'er their fates"
1064,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In anguish grieved, detesting life prolonged"
1065,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That brought with it another civil war.
1066,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And thus spake one, to justify his fears:"
1067,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""No other deeds the fates laid up in store"
1068,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"When Marius (1), victor over Teuton hosts,"
1069,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Afric's high conqueror, cast out from Rome,"
1070,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Lay hid in marshy ooze, at thy behest,"
1071,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,O Fortune!  by the yielding soil concealed
1072,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And waving rushes; but ere long the chains
1073,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of prison wore his weak and aged frame,"
1074,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And lengthened squalor: thus he paid for crime
1075,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,His punishment beforehand; doomed to die
1076,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Consul in triumph over wasted Rome.
1077,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Death oft refused him; and the very foe,"
1078,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In act to murder, shuddered in the stroke"
1079,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And dropped the weapon from his nerveless hand.
1080,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For through the prison gloom a flame of light
1081,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,He saw; the deities of crime abhorred;
1082,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The Marius to come.  A voice proclaimed
1083,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Mysterious, 'Hold!  the fates permit thee not"
1084,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That neck to sever.  Many a death he owes
1085,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To time's predestined laws ere his shall come;
1086,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Cease from thy madness.  If ye seek revenge
1087,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For all the blood shed by your slaughtered tribes to
1088,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Let this man, Cimbrians, live out all his days.'"
1089,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Not as their darling did the gods protect
1090,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The man of blood, but for his ruthless hand"
1091,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Fit to prepare that sacrifice of gore
1092,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Which fate demanded.  By the sea's despite
1093,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Borne to our foes, Jugurtha's wasted realm"
1094,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"He saw, now conquered; there in squalid huts"
1095,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Awhile he lay, and trod the hostile dust"
1096,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of Carthage, and his ruin matched with hers:"
1097,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Each from the other's fate some solace drew,"
1098,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And prostrate, pardoned heaven.  On Libyan soil (2)"
1099,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fresh fury gathering (3), next, when Fortune smiled"
1100,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The prisons he threw wide and freed the slaves.
1101,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Forth rushed the murderous bands, their melted chains"
1102,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Forged into weapons for his ruffian needs.
1103,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No charge he gave to mere recruits in guilt
1104,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Who brought not to the camp some proof of crime.
1105,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,How dread that day when conquering Marius seized
1106,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The city's ramparts!  with what fated speed
1107,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Death strode upon his victims!  plebs alike
1108,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And nobles perished; far and near the sword
1109,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Struck at his pleasure, till the temple floors"
1110,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Ran wet with slaughter and the crimson stream
1111,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Befouled with slippery gore the holy walls.
1112,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"No age found pity men of failing years,"
1113,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Just tottering to the grave, were hurled to death;"
1114,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"From infants, in their being's earliest dawn (4),"
1115,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The growing life was severed.  For what crime?
1116,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Twas cause enough for death that they could die.
1117,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The fury grew: soon 'twas a sluggard's part
1118,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To seek the guilty: hundreds died to swell
1119,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The tale of victims.  Shamed by empty hands,"
1120,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The bloodstained conqueror snatched a reeking head
1121,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"From neck unknown.  One way of life remained,"
1122,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To kiss with shuddering lips the red right hand (5).
1123,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Degenerate people!  Had ye hearts of men,"
1124,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Though ye were threatened by a thousand swords,"
1125,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Far rather death than centuries of life
1126,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Bought at such price; much more that breathing space
1127,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Till Sulla comes again (6).  But time would fail
1128,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,In weeping for the deaths of all who fell.
1129,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Encircled by innumerable bands
1130,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fell Baebius, his limbs asunder torn,"
1131,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"His vitals dragged abroad.  Antonius too,"
1132,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Prophet of ill, whose hoary head (7) was placed,"
1133,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Dripping with blood, upon the festal board."
1134,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,There headless fell the Crassi; mangled frames
1135,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,'Neath Fimbria's falchion: and the prison cells
1136,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were wet with tribunes' blood.  Hard by the fane
1137,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Where dwells the goddess and the sacred fire,"
1138,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fell aged Scaevola, though that gory hand (8)"
1139,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Had spared him, but the feeble tide of blood"
1140,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Still left the flame alive upon the hearth.
1141,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That selfsame year the seventh time restored (9)
1142,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The Consul's rods; that year to Marius brought
1143,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The end of life, when he at Fortune's hands"
1144,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,All ills had suffered; all her goods enjoyed.
1145,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1146,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""And what of those who at the Sacriport (10)"
1147,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And Colline gate were slain, then, when the rule"
1148,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of Earth and all her nations almost left
1149,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"This city for another, and the chiefs"
1150,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Who led the Samnite hoped that Rome might bleed
1151,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,More than at Caudium's Forks she bled of old?
1152,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Then came great Sulla to avenge the dead,"
1153,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And all the blood still left within her frame
1154,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Drew from the city; for the surgeon knife
1155,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Which shore the cancerous limbs cut in too deep,"
1156,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And shed the life stream from still healthy veins.
1157,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"True that the guilty fell, but not before"
1158,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,All else had perished.  Hatred had free course
1159,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And anger reigned unbridled by the law.
1160,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The victor's voice spake once; but each man struck
1161,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Just as he wished or willed.  The fatal steel
1162,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Urged by the servant laid the master low.
1163,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Sons dripped with gore of sires; and brothers fought
1164,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"For the foul trophy of a father slain,"
1165,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Or slew each other for the price of blood.
1166,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Men sought the tombs and, mingling with the dead,"
1167,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Hoped for escape; the wild beasts' dens were full.
1168,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,One strangled died; another from the height
1169,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fell headlong down upon the unpitying earth,"
1170,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And from the encrimsoned victor snatched his death:
1171,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"One built his funeral pyre and oped his veins,"
1172,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And sealed the furnace ere his blood was gone.
1173,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Borne through the trembling town the leaders' heads
1174,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were piled in middle forum: hence men knew
1175,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of murders else unpublished.  Not on gates
1176,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of Diomedes (11), tyrant king of Thrace,"
1177,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Nor of Antaeus, Libya's giant brood,"
1178,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were hung such horrors; nor in Pisa's hall
1179,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were seen and wept for when the suitors died.
1180,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Decay had touched the features of the slain
1181,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"When round the mouldering heap, with trembling steps"
1182,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The grief-struck parents sought and stole their dead.
1183,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"I, too, the body of my brother slain"
1184,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thought to remove, my victim to the peace"
1185,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Which Sulla made, and place his loved remains"
1186,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"On the forbidden pyre.  The head I found,"
1187,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But not the butchered corse.
1188,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1189,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""Why now renew"
1190,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The tale of Catulus's shade appeased?
1191,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And those dread tortures which the living frame
1192,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of Marius (12) suffered at the tomb of him
1193,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Who haply wished them not?  Pierced, mangled, torn --"
1194,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Nor speech nor grasp was left: his every limb
1195,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Maimed, hacked and riven; yet the fatal blow"
1196,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The murderers with savage purpose spared.
1197,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,'Twere scarce believed that one poor mortal frame
1198,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Such agonies could bear e'er death should come.
1199,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thus crushed beneath some ruin lie the dead;
1200,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thus shapeless from the deep are borne the drowned.
1201,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Why spoil delight by mutilating thus,"
1202,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The head of Marius?  To please Sulla's heart
1203,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That mangled visage must be known to all.
1204,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fortune, high goddess of Praeneste's fane,"
1205,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Saw all her townsmen hurried to their deaths
1206,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In one fell instant.  All the hope of Rome,"
1207,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The flower of Latium, stained with blood the field"
1208,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Where once the peaceful tribes their votes declared.
1209,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Famine and Sword, the raging sky and sea,"
1210,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And Earth upheaved, have laid such numbers low:"
1211,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But ne'er one man's revenge.  Between the slain
1212,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And living victims there was space no more,"
1213,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Death thus let slip, to deal the fatal blow."
1214,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Hardly when struck they fell; the severed head
1215,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Scarce toppled from the shoulders; but the slain
1216,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Blent in a weighty pile of massacre
1217,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Pressed out the life and helped the murderer's arm.
1218,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Secure from stain upon his lofty throne,"
1219,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Unshuddering sat the author of the whole,"
1220,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Nor feared that at his word such thousands fell.
1221,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,At length the Tuscan flood received the dead
1222,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The first upon his waves; the last on those
1223,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That lay beneath them; vessels in their course
1224,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Were stayed, and while the lower current flowed"
1225,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Still to the sea, the upper stood on high"
1226,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Dammed back by carnage.  Through the streets meanwhile
1227,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In headlong torrents ran a tide of blood,"
1228,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Which furrowing its path through town and field
1229,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Forced the slow river on.  But now his banks
1230,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"No longer held him, and the dead were thrown"
1231,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Back on the fields above.  With labour huge
1232,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,At length he struggled to his goal and stretched
1233,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,In crimson streak across the Tuscan Sea.
1234,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1235,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""For deeds like these, shall Sulla now be styled"
1236,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"'Darling of Fortune', 'Saviour of the State'?"
1237,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"For these, a tomb in middle field of Mars"
1238,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Record his fame?  Like horrors now return
1239,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For us to suffer; and the civil war
1240,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thus shall be waged again and thus shall end.
1241,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Yet worse disasters may our fears suggest,"
1242,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For now with greater carnage of mankind
1243,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The rival hosts in weightier battle meet.
1244,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To exiled Marius, successful strife"
1245,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Was Rome regained; triumphant Sulla knew
1246,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No greater joy than on his hated foes
1247,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To wreak his vengeance with unsparing sword.
1248,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But these more powerful rivals Fortune calls
1249,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To worse ambitions; nor would either chief
1250,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"For such reward as Sulla's wage the war."""
1251,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thus, mindful of his youth, the aged man"
1252,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Wept for the past, but feared the coming days."
1253,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1254,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Such terrors found in haughty Brutus' breast
1255,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No home.  When others sat them down to fear
1256,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"He did not so, but in the dewy night"
1257,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,When the great wain was turning round the pole
1258,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,He sought his kinsman Cato's humble home.
1259,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Him sleepless did he find, not for himself"
1260,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fearing, but pondering the fates of Rome,"
1261,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And deep in public cares.  And thus he spake:
1262,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""O thou in whom that virtue, which of yore"
1263,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Took flight from earth, now finds its only home,"
1264,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Outcast to all besides, but safe with thee:"
1265,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Vouchsafe thy counsel to my wavering soul
1266,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And make my weakness strength.  While Caesar some,"
1267,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Pompeius others, follow in the fight,"
1268,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Cato is Brutus' guide.  Art thou for peace,"
1269,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Holding thy footsteps in a tottering world
1270,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Unshaken?  Or wilt thou with the leaders' crimes
1271,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And with the people's fury take thy part,"
1272,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And by thy presence purge the war of guilt?
1273,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,In impious battles men unsheath the sword;
1274,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But each by cause impelled: the household crime;
1275,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Laws feared in peace; want by the sword removed;
1276,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And broken credit, that its ruin hides"
1277,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In general ruin.  Drawn by hope of gain,"
1278,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And not by thirst for blood, they seek the camp."
1279,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Shall Cato for war's sake make war alone?
1280,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,What profits it through all these wicked years
1281,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That thou hast lived untainted?  This were all
1282,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thy meed of virtue, that the wars which find"
1283,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Guilt in all else, shall make thee guilty too."
1284,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Ye gods, permit not that this fatal strife"
1285,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Should stir those hands to action!  When the clouds
1286,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of flying javelins hiss upon the air,"
1287,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Let not a dart be thine; nor spent in vain
1288,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Such virtue!  All the fury of the war
1289,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Shall launch itself on thee, for who, when faint"
1290,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And wounded, would not rush upon thy sword,"
1291,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Take thence his death, and make the murder thine?"
1292,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Do thou live on thy peaceful life apart
1293,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,As on their paths the stars unshaken roll.
1294,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The lower air that verges on the earth
1295,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Gives flame and fury to the levin bolt;
1296,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The deeps below the world engulph the winds
1297,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And tracts of flaming fire.  By Jove's decree
1298,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Olympus rears his summit o'er the clouds:
1299,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In lowlier valleys storms and winds contend,"
1300,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But peace eternal reigns upon the heights.
1301,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"What joy for Caesar, if the tidings come"
1302,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That such a citizen has joined the war?
1303,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Glad would he see thee e'en in Magnus' tents;
1304,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For Cato's conduct shall approve his own.
1305,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Pompeius, with the Consul in his ranks,"
1306,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And half the Senate and the other chiefs,"
1307,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Vexes my spirit; and should Cato too
1308,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Bend to a master's yoke, in all the world"
1309,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The one man free is Caesar.  But if thou
1310,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For freedom and thy country's laws alone
1311,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Be pleased to raise the sword, nor Magnus then"
1312,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Nor Caesar shall in Brutus find a foe.
1313,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Not till the fight is fought shall Brutus strike,"
1314,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Then strike the victor."""
1315,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1316,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Brutus thus; but spake
1317,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Cato from inmost breast these sacred words:
1318,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""Chief in all wickedness is civil war,"
1319,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Yet virtue in the paths marked out by fate
1320,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Treads on securely.  Heaven's will be the crime
1321,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To have made even Cato guilty.  Who has strength
1322,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To gaze unawed upon a toppling world?
1323,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"When stars and sky fall headlong, and when earth"
1324,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Slips from her base, who sits with folded hands?"
1325,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Shall unknown nations, touched by western strife,"
1326,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And monarchs born beneath another clime
1327,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Brave the dividing seas to join the war?
1328,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Shall Scythian tribes desert their distant north,"
1329,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And Getae haste to view the fall of Rome,"
1330,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And I look idly on?  As some fond sire,"
1331,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Reft of his sons, compelled by grief, himself"
1332,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Marshals the long procession to the tomb,"
1333,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thrusts his own hand within the funeral flames,"
1334,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Soothing his heart, and, as the lofty pyre"
1335,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Rises on high, applies the kindled torch:"
1336,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Nought, Rome, shall tear thee from me, till I hold"
1337,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thy form in death embraced; and Freedom's name,"
1338,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Shade though it be, I'll follow to the grave."
1339,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Yea!  let the cruel gods exact in full
1340,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Rome's expiation: of no drop of blood
1341,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The war be robbed.  I would that, to the gods"
1342,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of heaven and hell devoted, this my life"
1343,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Might satisfy their vengeance.  Decius fell,"
1344,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Crushed by the hostile ranks.  When Cato falls
1345,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Let Rhine's fierce barbarous hordes and both the hosts
1346,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thrust through my frame their darts!  May I alone
1347,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Receive in death the wounds of all the war!
1348,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thus may the people be redeemed, and thus"
1349,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Rome for her guilt pay the atonement due.
1350,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Why should men die who wish to bear the yoke
1351,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And shrink not from the tyranny to come?
1352,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Strike me, and me alone, of laws and rights"
1353,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,In vain the guardian: this vicarious life
1354,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Shall give Hesperia peace and end her toils.
1355,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Who then will reign shall find no need for war.
1356,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"You ask, 'Why follow Magnus?  If he wins (13)"
1357,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,He too will claim the Empire of the world.'
1358,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Then let him, conquering with my service, learn"
1359,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Not for himself to conquer.""  Thus he spoke"
1360,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And stirred the blood that ran in Brutus' veins
1361,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Moving the youth to action in the war.
1362,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1363,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Soon as the sun dispelled the chilly night,"
1364,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The sounding doors flew wide, and from the tomb"
1365,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of dead Hortensius grieving Marcia came (14).
1366,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,First joined in wedlock to a greater man
1367,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Three children did she bear to grace his home:
1368,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Then Cato to Hortensius gave the dame
1369,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To be a fruitful mother of his sons
1370,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And join their houses in a closer tie.
1371,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And now the last sad offices were done
1372,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"She came with hair dishevelled, beaten breast,"
1373,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And ashes on her brow, and features worn"
1374,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,With grief; thus only pleasing to the man.
1375,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""When youth was in me and maternal power"
1376,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"I did thy bidding, Cato, and received"
1377,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,A second husband: now in years grown old
1378,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Ne'er to be parted I return to thee.
1379,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Renew our former pledges undefiled:
1380,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Give back the name of wife: upon my tomb
1381,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Let 'Marcia, spouse to Cato,' be engraved."
1382,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Nor let men question in the time to come,"
1383,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Did'st thou compel, or did I willing leave"
1384,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"My first espousals.  Not in happy times,"
1385,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Partner of joys, I come; but days of care"
1386,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And labour shall be mine to share with thee.
1387,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Nor leave me here, but take me to the camp,"
1388,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thy fond companion: why should Magnus' wife
1389,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Be nearer, Cato, to the wars than thine?"""
1390,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1391,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Although the times were warlike and the fates
1392,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Called to the fray, he lent a willing ear."
1393,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Yet must they plight their faith in simple form
1394,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of law; their witnesses the gods alone.
1395,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No festal wreath of flowers crowned the gate
1396,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Nor glittering fillet on each post entwined;
1397,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"No flaming torch was there, nor ivory steps,"
1398,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No couch with robes of broidered gold adorned;
1399,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No comely matron placed upon her brow
1400,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The bridal garland, or forbad the foot (15)"
1401,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To touch the threshold stone; no saffron veil
1402,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Concealed the timid blushes of the bride;
1403,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No jewelled belt confined her flowing robe (16)
1404,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Nor modest circle bound her neck; no scarf
1405,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Hung lightly on the snowy shoulder's edge
1406,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Around the naked arm. Just as she came,"
1407,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Wearing the garb of sorrow, while the wool"
1408,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Covered the purple border of her robe,"
1409,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thus was she wedded.  As she greets her sons
1410,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,So doth she greet her husband.  Festal games
1411,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Graced not their nuptials, nor were friends and kin"
1412,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,As by the Sabines bidden: silent both
1413,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"They joined in marriage, yet content, unseen"
1414,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,By any save by Brutus.  Sad and stern
1415,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,On Cato's lineaments the marks of grief
1416,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Were still unsoftened, and the hoary hair"
1417,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Hung o'er his reverend visage; for since first
1418,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Men flew to arms, his locks were left unkempt"
1419,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To stream upon his brow, and on his chin"
1420,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,His beard untended grew.  'Twas his alone
1421,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Who hated not, nor loved, for all mankind"
1422,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To mourn alike.  Nor did their former couch
1423,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Again receive them, for his lofty soul"
1424,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,E'en lawful love resisted.  'Twas his rule
1425,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Inflexible, to keep the middle path"
1426,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Marked out and bounded; to observe the laws
1427,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of natural right; and for his country's sake
1428,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To risk his life, his all, as not for self"
1429,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Brought into being, but for all the world:"
1430,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Such was his creed.  To him a sumptuous feast
1431,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Was hunger conquered, and the lowly hut,"
1432,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Which scarce kept out the winter, was a home"
1433,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Equal to palaces: a robe of price
1434,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Such hairy garments as were worn of old:
1435,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The end of marriage, offspring.  To the State"
1436,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Father alike and husband, right and law"
1437,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,He ever followed with unswerving step:
1438,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,No thought of selfish pleasure turned the scale
1439,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In Cato's acts, or swayed his upright soul."
1440,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1441,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Meanwhile Pompeius led his trembling host
1442,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To fields Campanian, and held the walls"
1443,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,First founded by the chief of Trojan race (17).
1444,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"These chose he for the central seat of war,"
1445,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Some troops despatching who might meet the foe
1446,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Where shady Apennine lifts up the ridge
1447,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of mid Italia; nearest to the sky
1448,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Upsoaring, with the seas on either hand,"
1449,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The upper and the lower.  Pisa's sands
1450,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Breaking the margin of the Tuscan deep,"
1451,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Here bound his mountains: there Ancona's towers
1452,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Laved by Dalmatian waves.  Rivers immense,"
1453,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In his recesses born, pass on their course,"
1454,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To either sea diverging.  To the left
1455,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Metaurus, and Crustumium's torrent, fall"
1456,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Sena's streams and Aufidus who bursts
1457,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,On Adrian billows; and that mighty flood
1458,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Which, more than all the rivers of the earth,"
1459,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Sweeps down the soil and tears the woods away
1460,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And drains Hesperia's springs.  In fabled lore
1461,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,His banks were first by poplar shade enclosed: (18)
1462,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And when by Phaethon the waning day
1463,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Was drawn in path transverse, and all the heaven"
1464,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Blazed with his car aflame, and from the depths"
1465,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of inmost earth were rapt all other floods,"
1466,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Padus still rolled in pride of stream along.
1467,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Nile were no larger, but that o'er the sand"
1468,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of level Egypt he spreads out his waves;
1469,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Nor Ister, if he sought the Scythian main"
1470,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Unhelped upon his journey through the world
1471,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,By tributary waters not his own.
1472,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"But on the right hand Tiber has his source,"
1473,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Deep-flowing Rutuba, Vulturnus swift,"
1474,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Sarnus breathing vapours of the night
1475,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Rise there, and Liris with Vestinian wave"
1476,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Still gliding through Marica's shady grove,"
1477,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Siler flowing through Salernian meads:
1478,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Macra's swift unnavigable stream
1479,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,By Luna lost in Ocean.  On the Alps
1480,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Whose spurs strike plainwards, and on fields of Gaul"
1481,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The cloudy heights of Apennine look down
1482,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,In further distance: on his nearer slopes
1483,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The Sabine turns the ploughshare; Umbrian kine
1484,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Marsian fatten; with his pineclad rocks
1485,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"He girds the tribes of Latium, nor leaves"
1486,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Hesperia's soil until the waves that beat
1487,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,On Scylla's cave compel.  His southern spurs
1488,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Extend to Juno's temple, and of old"
1489,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Stretched further than Italia, till the main"
1490,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,O'erstepped his limits and the lands repelled.
1491,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"But, when the seas were joined, Pelorus claimed"
1492,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,His latest summits for Sicilia's isle.
1493,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1494,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Caesar, in rage for war, rejoicing found"
1495,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Foes in Italia; no bloodless steps
1496,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Nor vacant homes had pleased him (19); so his march
1497,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were wasted: now the coming war was joined
1498,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Unbroken to the past; to force the gates
1499,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Not find them open, fire and sword to bring"
1500,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Upon the harvests, not through fields unharmed"
1501,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To pass his legions -- this was Caesar's joy;
1502,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"In peaceful guise to march, this was his shame."
1503,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Italia's cities, doubtful in their choice,"
1504,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Though to the earliest onset of the war
1505,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"About to yield, strengthened their walls with mounds"
1506,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And deepest trench encircling: massive stones
1507,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And bolts of war to hurl upon the foe
1508,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,They place upon the turrets.  Magnus most
1509,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The people's favour held, yet faith with fear"
1510,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fought in their breasts.  As when, with strident blast,"
1511,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,A southern tempest has possessed the main
1512,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And all the billows follow in its track:
1513,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Then, by the Storm-king smitten, should the earth"
1514,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Set Eurus free upon the swollen deep,"
1515,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"It shall not yield to him, though cloud and sky"
1516,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Confess his strength; but in the former wind
1517,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Still find its master.  But their fears prevailed,"
1518,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And Caesar's fortune, o'er their wavering faith."
1519,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,For Libo fled Etruria; Umbria lost
1520,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Her freedom, driving Thermus (20) from her bounds;"
1521,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Great Sulla's son, unworthy of his sire,"
1522,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Feared at the name of Caesar: Varus sought
1523,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The caves and woods, when smote the hostile horse"
1524,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The gates of Auximon; and Spinther driven
1525,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"From Asculum, the victor on his track,"
1526,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fled with his standards, soldierless; and thou,"
1527,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Scipio, did'st leave Nuceria's citadel"
1528,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Deserted, though by bravest legions held"
1529,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Sent home by Caesar for the Parthian war (21);
1530,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Whom Magnus earlier, to his kinsman gave"
1531,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"A loan of Roman blood, to fight the Gaul."
1532,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1533,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But brave Domitius held firm his post (22)
1534,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Behind Corfinium's ramparts; his the troops
1535,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Who newly levied kept the judgment hall
1536,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,At Milo's trial (23).  When from far the plain
1537,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Rolled up a dusty cloud, beneath whose veil"
1538,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The sheen of armour glistening in the sun,"
1539,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Revealed a marching host.  ""Dash down,"" he cried,"
1540,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Swift; as ye can, the bridge that spans the stream;"
1541,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And thou, O river, from thy mountain source"
1542,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"With all thy torrents rushing, planks and beams"
1543,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Ruined and broken on thy foaming breast
1544,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Bear onward to the sea.  The war shall stop
1545,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Here, to our triumph; for this headlong chief"
1546,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Here first at our firm bidding shall be stayed."""
1547,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"He bade his squadrons, speeding from the walls,"
1548,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Charge on the bridge: in vain: for Caesar saw
1549,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,They sought to free the river from his chains (24)
1550,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And bar his march; and roused to ire, he cried:"
1551,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""Were not the walls sufficient to protect"
1552,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Your coward souls?  Seek ye by barricades
1553,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And streams to keep me back?  What though the flood
1554,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of swollen Ganges were across my path?
1555,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Now Rubicon is passed, no stream on earth"
1556,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Shall hinder Caesar!  Forward, horse and foot,"
1557,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And ere it totters rush upon the bridge."""
1558,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Urged in their swiftest gallop to the front
1559,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Dashed the light horse across the sounding plain;
1560,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And suddenly, as storm in summer, flew"
1561,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"A cloud of javelins forth, by sinewy arms"
1562,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Hurled at the foe; the guard is put to flight,"
1563,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And conquering Caesar, seizing on the bridge,"
1564,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Compels the enemy to keep the walls.
1565,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Now do the mighty engines, soon to hurl"
1566,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Gigantic stones, press forward, and the ram"
1567,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Creeps 'neath the ramparts; when the gates fly back,"
1568,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And lo! the traitor troops, foul crime in war,"
1569,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Yield up their leader.  Him they place before
1570,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1571,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"His proud compatriot; yet with upright form,"
1572,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And scornful features and with noble mien,"
1573,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,He asks his death.  But Caesar knew his wish
1574,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Was punishment, and pardon was his fear:"
1575,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""Live though thou would'st not,"" so the chieftain spake,"
1576,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""And by my gift, unwilling, see the day:"
1577,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Be to my conquered foes the cause of hope,"
1578,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Proof of my clemency -- or if thou wilt
1579,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Take arms again -- and should'st thou conquer, count"
1580,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"This pardon nothing.""  Thus he spake, and bade"
1581,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Let loose the bands and set the captive free.
1582,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Ah!  better had he died, and fortune spared"
1583,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The Roman's last dishonour, whose worse doom"
1584,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"It is, that he who joined his country's camp"
1585,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And fought with Magnus for the Senate's cause
1586,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Should gain for this -- a pardon!  Yet he curbed
1587,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"His anger, thinking, ""Wilt thou then to Rome"
1588,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And peaceful scenes, degenerate?  Rather war,"
1589,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The furious battle and the certain end!
1590,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Break with life's ties: be Caesar's gift in vain."""
1591,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1592,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Pompeius, ignorant that his captain thus"
1593,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Was taken, armed his levies newly raised"
1594,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To give his legions strength; and as he thought
1595,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To sound his trumpets with the coming dawn,"
1596,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,To test his soldiers ere he moved his camp
1597,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thus in majestic tones their ranks addressed:
1598,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"""Soldiers of Rome!  Avengers of her laws!"
1599,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"To whom the Senate gives no private arms,"
1600,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Ask by your voices for the battle sign.
1601,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Fierce falls the pillage on Hesperian fields,"
1602,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Gallia's fury o'er the snowy Alps (25)
1603,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Is poured upon us.  Caesar's swords at last
1604,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Are red with Roman blood.  But with the wound
1605,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,We gain the better cause; the crime is theirs.
1606,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"No war is this, but for offended Rome"
1607,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,We wreak the vengeance; as when Catiline
1608,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Lifted against her roofs the flaming brand
1609,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And, partner in his fury, Lentulus,"
1610,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And mad Cethegus (26) with his naked arm.
1611,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Is such thy madness, Caesar?  when the Fates"
1612,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,With great Camillus' and Metellus' names
1613,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Might place thine own, dost thou prefer to rank"
1614,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,With Marius and Cinna?  Swift shall be
1615,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Thy fall: as Lepidus before the sword
1616,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of Catulus; or who my axes felt,"
1617,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Carbo (27), now buried in Sicanian tomb;"
1618,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Or who, in exile, roused Iberia's hordes,"
1619,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Sertorius -- yet, witness Heaven, with these"
1620,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,I hate to rank thee; hate the task that Rome
1621,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Has laid upon me, to oppose thy rage."
1622,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Would that in safety from the Parthian war
1623,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And Scythian steppes had conquering Crassus come!
1624,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Then haply had'st thou fallen by the hand
1625,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That smote vile Spartacus the robber foe.
1626,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,But if among my triumphs fate has said
1627,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thy conquest shall be written, know this heart"
1628,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Still sends the life blood coursing: and this arm (28)
1629,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Still vigorously flings the dart afield.
1630,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"He deems me slothful.  Caesar, thou shalt learn"
1631,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,We brook not peace because we lag in war.
1632,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Old, does he call me?  Fear not ye mine age."
1633,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Let me be elder, if his soldiers are."
1634,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The highest point a citizen can reach
1635,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"And leave his people free, is mine: a throne"
1636,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Alone were higher; whoso would surpass
1637,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Pompeius, aims at that.  Both Consuls stand"
1638,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Here; here for battle stand your lawful chiefs:
1639,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And shall this Caesar drag the Senate down?
1640,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Not with such blindness, not so lost to shame"
1641,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Does Fortune rule.  Does he take heart from Gaul:
1642,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"For years on years rebellious, and a life"
1643,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Spent there in labour?  or because he fled
1644,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Rhine's icy torrent and the shifting pools
1645,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,He calls an ocean?  or unchallenged sought
1646,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Britannia's cliffs; then turned his back in flight?
1647,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Or does he boast because his citizens
1648,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were driven in arms to leave their hearths and homes?
1649,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Ah, vain delusion!  not from thee they fled:"
1650,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"My steps they follow -- mine, whose conquering signs"
1651,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Swept all the ocean (29), and who, ere the moon"
1652,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Twice filled her orb and waned, compelled to flight"
1653,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The pirate, shrinking from the open sea,"
1654,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And humbly begging for a narrow home
1655,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,In some poor nook on shore.  'Twas I again
1656,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Who, happier far than Sulla, drave to death (30)"
1657,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"That king who, exiled to the deep recess"
1658,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Of Scythian Pontus, held the fates of Rome"
1659,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Still in the balances.  Where is the land

1801,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Thus spake to Fortune: ""Thou whose high decree"
1802,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Has made us exiles from Italia's shores,"
1803,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Grant us at least to leave them.""  Yet the fates"
1804,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Hardly permitted, for a murmur vast"
1805,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Came from the ocean, as the countless keels"
1806,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Furrowed the waters, and with ceaseless splash"
1807,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The parted billows rose again and fell.
1808,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Then were the gates thrown wide; for with the fates
1809,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The city turned to Caesar: and the foe,"
1810,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Seizing the town, rushed onward by the pier"
1811,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,That circled in the harbour; then they knew
1812,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,With shame and sorrow that the fleet was gone
1813,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And held the open: and Pompeius' flight
1814,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Gave a poor triumph.
1815,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1816,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Yet was narrower far
1817,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The channel which gave access to the sea
1818,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Than that Euboean strait (34) whose waters lave
1819,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The shore by Chalcis.  Here two ships stuck fast
1820,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Alone, of all the fleet; the fatal hook"
1821,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Grappled their decks and drew them to the land,"
1822,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,And the first bloodshed of the civil war
1823,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Here left a blush upon the ocean wave.
1824,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,As when the famous ship (36) sought Phasis' stream
1825,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The rocky gates closed in and hardly gripped
1826,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Her flying stern; then from the empty sea
1827,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,The cliffs rebounding to their ancient seat
1828,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Were fixed to move no more.  But now the steps
1829,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,Of morn approaching tinged the eastern sky
1830,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"With roseate hues: the Pleiades were dim,"
1831,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The wagon of the Charioteer grew pale,"
1832,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"The planets faded, and the silvery star"
1833,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Which ushers in the day, was lost in light."
1834,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,
1835,THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS,"Then Magnus, hold'st the deep; yet not the same"

1893,IV.,to death (line 216).  At the Colline gate was fought the

2000,MASSILIA,Prepared against thy battles; and the fleets (2)
2001,MASSILIA,Which by the ferryman of the flaming stream
2002,MASSILIA,Were made to bear thy dead: while Hell itself
2003,MASSILIA,Relaxed its punishments; the sisters three
2004,MASSILIA,With busy fingers all their needful task
2005,MASSILIA,"Could scarce accomplish, and the threads of fate"
2006,MASSILIA,"Dropped from their weary hands.  With me thy wife,"
2007,MASSILIA,"Thou, Magnus, leddest happy triumphs home:"
2008,MASSILIA,"New wedlock brings new luck.  Thy concubine,"
2009,MASSILIA,"Whose star brings all her mighty husbands ill,"
2010,MASSILIA,"Cornelia, weds in thee a breathing tomb. (3)"
2011,MASSILIA,Through wars and oceans let her cling to thee
2012,MASSILIA,So long as I may break thy nightly rest:
2013,MASSILIA,"No moment left thee for her love, but all"
2014,MASSILIA,"By night to me, by day to Caesar given."
2015,MASSILIA,Me not the oblivious banks of Lethe's stream
2016,MASSILIA,Have made forgetful; and the kings of death
2017,MASSILIA,Have suffered me to join thee; in mid fight
2018,MASSILIA,"I will be with thee, and my haunting ghost"
2019,MASSILIA,Remind thee Caesar's daughter was thy spouse.
2020,MASSILIA,Thy sword kills not our pledges; civil war
2021,MASSILIA,"Shall make thee wholly mine.""  She spake and fled."
2022,MASSILIA,"But he, though heaven and hell thus bode defeat,"
2023,MASSILIA,"More bent on war, with mind assured of ill,"
2024,MASSILIA,"""Why dread vain phantoms of a dreaming brain?"
2025,MASSILIA,Or nought of sense and feeling to the soul
2026,MASSILIA,"Is left by death; or death itself is nought."""
2027,MASSILIA,
2028,MASSILIA,Now fiery Titan in declining path
2029,MASSILIA,"Dipped to the waves, his bright circumference"
2030,MASSILIA,So much diminished as a growing moon
2031,MASSILIA,"Not yet full circled, or when past the full;"
2032,MASSILIA,When to the fleet a hospitable coast
2033,MASSILIA,"Gave access, and the ropes in order laid,"
2034,MASSILIA,The sailors struck the masts and rowed ashore.
2035,MASSILIA,
2036,MASSILIA,When Caesar saw the fleet escape his grasp
2037,MASSILIA,"And hidden from his view by lengthening seas,"
2038,MASSILIA,"Left without rival on Hesperian soil,"
2039,MASSILIA,He found no joy in triumph; rather grieved
2040,MASSILIA,That thus in safety Magnus' flight was sped.
2041,MASSILIA,Not any gifts of Fortune now sufficed
2042,MASSILIA,"His fiery spirit; and no victory won,"
2043,MASSILIA,Unless the war was finished with the stroke.
2044,MASSILIA,"Then arms he laid aside, in guise of peace"
2045,MASSILIA,Seeking the people's favour; skilled to know
2046,MASSILIA,"How to arouse their ire, and how to gain"
2047,MASSILIA,The popular love by corn in plenty given.
2048,MASSILIA,For famine only makes a city free;
2049,MASSILIA,By gifts of food the tyrant buys a crowd
2050,MASSILIA,To cringe before him: but a people starved
2051,MASSILIA,Is fearless ever.
2052,MASSILIA,
2053,MASSILIA,Curio he bids
2054,MASSILIA,"Cross over to Sicilian cities, where"
2055,MASSILIA,Or ocean by a sudden rise o'erwhelmed
2056,MASSILIA,"The land, or split the isthmus right in twain,"
2057,MASSILIA,Leaving a path for seas.  Unceasing tides
2058,MASSILIA,There labour hugely lest again should meet
2059,MASSILIA,The mountains rent asunder.  Nor were left
2060,MASSILIA,Sardinian shores unvisited: each isle
2061,MASSILIA,Is blest with noble harvests which have filled
2062,MASSILIA,"More than all else the granaries of Rome,"
2063,MASSILIA,And poured their plenty on Hesperia's shores.
2064,MASSILIA,"Not even Libya, with its fertile soil,"
2065,MASSILIA,"Their yield surpasses, when the southern wind"
2066,MASSILIA,Gives way to northern and permits the clouds
2067,MASSILIA,To drop their moisture on the teeming earth.
2068,MASSILIA,"This ordered, Caesar leads his legions on,"
2069,MASSILIA,"Not armed for war, but as in time of peace"
2070,MASSILIA,Returning to his home.  Ah!  had he come
2071,MASSILIA,"With only Gallia conquered and the North (4),"
2072,MASSILIA,What long array of triumph had he brought!
2073,MASSILIA,What pictured scenes of battle!  how had Rhine
2074,MASSILIA,"And Ocean borne his chains!  How noble Gaul,"
2075,MASSILIA,And Britain's fair-haired chiefs his lofty car
2076,MASSILIA,Had followed!  Such a triumph had he lost
2077,MASSILIA,By further conquest.  Now in silent fear
2078,MASSILIA,"They watched his marching troops, nor joyful towns"
2079,MASSILIA,Poured out their crowds to welcome his return.
2080,MASSILIA,"Yet did the conqueror's proud soul rejoice,"
2081,MASSILIA,"Far more than at their love, at such a fear."
2082,MASSILIA,
2083,MASSILIA,"Now Anxur's hold was passed, the oozy road"
2084,MASSILIA,"That separates the marsh, the grove sublime (5)"
2085,MASSILIA,"Where reigns the Scythian goddess, and the path"
2086,MASSILIA,By which men bear the fasces to the feast
2087,MASSILIA,On Alba's summit.  From the height afar --
2088,MASSILIA,Gazing in awe upon the walls of Rome
2089,MASSILIA,"His native city, since the Northern war"
2090,MASSILIA,"Unseen, unvisited -- thus Caesar spake:"
2091,MASSILIA,"""Who would not fight for such a god-like town?"
2092,MASSILIA,"And have they left thee, Rome, without a blow?"
2093,MASSILIA,Thank the high gods no eastern hosts are here
2094,MASSILIA,To wreak their fury; nor Sarmatian horde
2095,MASSILIA,With northern tribes conjoined; by Fortune's gift
2096,MASSILIA,This war is civil: else this coward chief
2097,MASSILIA,"Had been thy ruin."""
2098,MASSILIA,
2099,MASSILIA,Trembling at his feet
2100,MASSILIA,"He found the city: deadly fire and flame,"
2101,MASSILIA,"As from a conqueror, gods and fanes dispersed;"
2102,MASSILIA,"Such was the measure of their fear, as though"
2103,MASSILIA,His power and wish were one.  No festal shout
2104,MASSILIA,"Greeted his march, no feigned acclaim of joy."
2105,MASSILIA,Scarce had they time for hate.  In Phoebus' hall
2106,MASSILIA,"Their hiding places left, a crowd appeared"
2107,MASSILIA,"Of Senators, uncalled, for none could call."
2108,MASSILIA,No Consul there the sacred shrine adorned
2109,MASSILIA,"Nor Praetor next in rank, and every seat"
2110,MASSILIA,Placed for the officers of state was void:
2111,MASSILIA,Caesar was all; and to his private voice (6)
2112,MASSILIA,All else were listeners.  The fathers sat
2113,MASSILIA,"Ready to grant a temple or a throne,"
2114,MASSILIA,If such his wish; and for themselves to vote
2115,MASSILIA,Or death or exile.  Well it was for Rome
2116,MASSILIA,That Caesar blushed to order what they feared.
2117,MASSILIA,Yet in one breast the spirit of freedom rose
2118,MASSILIA,Indignant for the laws; for when the gates
2119,MASSILIA,"Of Saturn's temple hot Metellus saw,"
2120,MASSILIA,"Were yielding to the shock, he clove the ranks"
2121,MASSILIA,"Of Caesar's troops, and stood before the doors"
2122,MASSILIA,As yet unopened.  'Tis the love of gold
2123,MASSILIA,Alone that fears not death; no hand is raised
2124,MASSILIA,For perished laws or violated rights:
2125,MASSILIA,"But for this dross, the vilest cause of all,"
2126,MASSILIA,Men fight and die.  Thus did the Tribune bar
2127,MASSILIA,"The victor's road to rapine, and with voice"
2128,MASSILIA,"Clear ringing spake: ""Save o'er Metellus dead"
2129,MASSILIA,This temple opens not; my sacred blood
2130,MASSILIA,"Shall flow, thou robber, ere the gold be thine."
2131,MASSILIA,And surely shall the Tribune's power defied
2132,MASSILIA,"Find an avenging god; this Crassus knew (7),"
2133,MASSILIA,"Who, followed by our curses, sought the war"
2134,MASSILIA,And met disaster on the Parthian plains.
2135,MASSILIA,"Draw then thy sword, nor fear the crowd that gapes"
2136,MASSILIA,To view thy crimes: the citizens are gone.
2137,MASSILIA,Not from our treasury reward for guilt
2138,MASSILIA,"Thy hosts shall ravish: other towns are left,"
2139,MASSILIA,And other nations; wage the war on them --
2140,MASSILIA,"Drain not Rome's peace for spoil.""  The victor then,"
2141,MASSILIA,"Incensed to ire: ""Vain is thy hope to fall"
2142,MASSILIA,"In noble death, as guardian of the right;"
2143,MASSILIA,"With all thine honours, thou of Caesar's rage"
2144,MASSILIA,Art little worthy: never shall thy blood
2145,MASSILIA,Defile his hand.  Time lowest things with high
2146,MASSILIA,"Confounds not yet so much that, if thy voice"
2147,MASSILIA,"Could save the laws, it were not better far"
2148,MASSILIA,"They fell by Caesar.""  Such his lofty words."
2149,MASSILIA,
2150,MASSILIA,"But as the Tribune yielded not, his rage"
2151,MASSILIA,"Rose yet the more, and at his soldiers' swords"
2152,MASSILIA,"One look he cast, forgetting for the time"
2153,MASSILIA,What robe he wore; but soon Metellus heard
2154,MASSILIA,"These words from Cotta: ""When men bow to power"
2155,MASSILIA,"Freedom of speech is only Freedom's bane (8),"
2156,MASSILIA,"Whose shade at least survives, if with free will"
2157,MASSILIA,Thou dost whate'er is bidden thee.  For us
2158,MASSILIA,Some pardon may be found: a host of ills
2159,MASSILIA,"Compelled submission, and the shame is less"
2160,MASSILIA,That to have done which could not be refused.
2161,MASSILIA,"Yield, then, this wealth, the seeds of direful war."
2162,MASSILIA,"A nation's anger is by losses stirred,"
2163,MASSILIA,When laws protect it; but the hungry slave
2164,MASSILIA,"Brings danger to his master, not himself."""
2165,MASSILIA,
2166,MASSILIA,At this Metellus yielded from the path;
2167,MASSILIA,"And as the gates rolled backward, echoed loud"
2168,MASSILIA,"The rock Tarpeian, and the temple's depths"
2169,MASSILIA,Gave up the treasure which for centuries
2170,MASSILIA,No hand had touched: all that the Punic foe
2171,MASSILIA,"And Perses and Philippus conquered gave,"
2172,MASSILIA,And all the gold which Pyrrhus panic-struck
2173,MASSILIA,"Left when he fled: that gold (9), the price of Rome,"
2174,MASSILIA,"Which yet Fabricius sold not, and the hoard"
2175,MASSILIA,Laid up by saving sires; the tribute sent
2176,MASSILIA,By Asia's richest nations; and the wealth
2177,MASSILIA,"Which conquering Metellus brought from Crete,"
2178,MASSILIA,And Cato (10) bore from distant Cyprus home;
2179,MASSILIA,"And last, the riches torn from captive kings"
2180,MASSILIA,And borne before Pompeius when he came
2181,MASSILIA,"In frequent triumph.  Thus was robbed the shrine,"
2182,MASSILIA,And Caesar first brought poverty to Rome.
2183,MASSILIA,
2184,MASSILIA,Meanwhile all nations of the earth were moved
2185,MASSILIA,"To share in Magnus' fortunes and the war,"
2186,MASSILIA,"And in his fated ruin.  Graecia sent,"
2187,MASSILIA,"Nearest of all, her succours to the host."
2188,MASSILIA,From Cirrha and Parnassus' double peak
2189,MASSILIA,"And from Amphissa, Phocis sent her youth:"
2190,MASSILIA,Boeotian leaders muster in the meads
2191,MASSILIA,"By Dirce laved, and where Cephisus rolls"
2192,MASSILIA,Gifted with fateful power his stream along:
2193,MASSILIA,"And where Alpheus, who beyond the sea (11)"
2194,MASSILIA,In fount Sicilian seeks the day again.
2195,MASSILIA,"Pisa deserted stands, and Oeta, loved"
2196,MASSILIA,By Hercules of old; Dodona's oaks
2197,MASSILIA,"Are left to silence by the sacred train,"
2198,MASSILIA,And all Epirus rushes to the war.
2199,MASSILIA,"And proud Athena, mistress of the seas,"
2200,MASSILIA,Sends three poor ships (alas! her all) to prove
2201,MASSILIA,Her ancient victory o'er the Persian King.
2202,MASSILIA,Next seek the battle Creta's hundred tribes
2203,MASSILIA,Beloved of Jove and rivalling the east
2204,MASSILIA,In skill to wing the arrow from the bow.
2205,MASSILIA,"The walls of Dardan Oricum, the woods"
2206,MASSILIA,"Where Athamanians wander, and the banks"
2207,MASSILIA,Of swift Absyrtus foaming to the main
2208,MASSILIA,Are left forsaken.  Enchelaean tribes
2209,MASSILIA,"Whose king was Cadmus, and whose name records"
2210,MASSILIA,"His transformation (12), join the host; and those"
2211,MASSILIA,Who till Penean fields and turn the share
2212,MASSILIA,"Above Iolcos in Thessalian lands."""
2213,MASSILIA,There first men steeled their hearts to dare the waves (13)
2214,MASSILIA,And 'gainst the rage of ocean and the storm
2215,MASSILIA,"To match their strength, when the rude Argo sailed"
2216,MASSILIA,"Upon that distant quest, and spurned the shore,"
2217,MASSILIA,"Joining remotest nations in her flight,"
2218,MASSILIA,And gave the fates another form of death.
2219,MASSILIA,Left too was Pholoe; pretended home
2220,MASSILIA,Where dwelt the fabled race of double form (14);
2221,MASSILIA,Arcadian Maenalus; the Thracian mount
2222,MASSILIA,"Named Haemus; Strymon whence, as autumn falls,"
2223,MASSILIA,Winged squadrons seek the banks of warmer Nile;
2224,MASSILIA,And all the isles the mouths of Ister bathe
2225,MASSILIA,Mixed with the tidal wave; the land through which
2226,MASSILIA,The cooling eddies of Caicus flow
2227,MASSILIA,Idalian; and Arisbe bare of glebe.
2228,MASSILIA,"The hinds of Pitane, and those who till"
2229,MASSILIA,Celaenae's fields which mourned of yore the gift
2230,MASSILIA,"Of Pallas (15), and the vengeance of the god,"
2231,MASSILIA,All draw the sword; and those from Marsyas' flood
2232,MASSILIA,"First swift, then doubling backwards with the stream"
2233,MASSILIA,Of sinuous Meander: and from where
2234,MASSILIA,Pactolus leaves his golden source and leaps
2235,MASSILIA,From Earth permitting; and with rival wealth
2236,MASSILIA,Rich Hermus parts the meads.  Nor stayed the bands
2237,MASSILIA,"Of Troy, but (doomed as in old time) they joined"
2238,MASSILIA,Pompeius' fated camp: nor held them back
2239,MASSILIA,"The fabled past, nor Caesar's claimed descent"
2240,MASSILIA,From their Iulus.  Syrian peoples came
2241,MASSILIA,From palmy Idumea and the walls
2242,MASSILIA,Of Ninus great of yore; from windy plains
2243,MASSILIA,"Of far Damascus and from Gaza's hold,"
2244,MASSILIA,"From Sidon's courts enriched with purple dye,"
2245,MASSILIA,And Tyre oft trembling with the shaken earth.
2246,MASSILIA,All these led on by Cynosura's light (16)
2247,MASSILIA,Furrow their certain path to reach the war.
2248,MASSILIA,
2249,MASSILIA,Phoenicians first (if story be believed)
2250,MASSILIA,Dared to record in characters; for yet
2251,MASSILIA,"Papyrus was not fashioned, and the priests"
2252,MASSILIA,"Of Memphis, carving symbols upon walls"
2253,MASSILIA,Of mystic sense (in shape of beast or fowl)
2254,MASSILIA,Preserved the secrets of their magic art.
2255,MASSILIA,
2256,MASSILIA,Next Persean Tarsus and high Taurus' groves
2257,MASSILIA,"Are left deserted, and Corycium's cave;"
2258,MASSILIA,"And all Cilicia's ports, pirate no more,"
2259,MASSILIA,Resound with preparation.  Nor the East
2260,MASSILIA,"Refused the call, where furthest Ganges dares,"
2261,MASSILIA,"Alone of rivers, to discharge his stream"
2262,MASSILIA,Against the sun opposing; on this shore (17)
2263,MASSILIA,The Macedonian conqueror stayed his foot
2264,MASSILIA,And found the world his victor; here too rolls
2265,MASSILIA,Indus his torrent with Hydaspes joined
2266,MASSILIA,Yet hardly feels it; here from luscious reed
2267,MASSILIA,Men draw sweet liquor; here they dye their locks
2268,MASSILIA,"With tints of saffron, and with coloured gems"
2269,MASSILIA,"Bind down their flowing garments; here are they,"
2270,MASSILIA,"Who satiate of life and proud to die,"
2271,MASSILIA,"Ascend the blazing pyre, and conquering fate,"
2272,MASSILIA,Scorn to live longer; but triumphant give
2273,MASSILIA,The remnant of their days in flame to heaven. (18)
2274,MASSILIA,
2275,MASSILIA,Nor fails to join the host a hardy band
2276,MASSILIA,"Of Cappadocians, tilling now the soil,"
2277,MASSILIA,Once pirates of the main: nor those who dwell
2278,MASSILIA,"Where steep Niphates hurls the avalanche,"
2279,MASSILIA,And where on Median Coatra's sides
2280,MASSILIA,The giant forest rises to the sky.
2281,MASSILIA,"And you, Arabians, from your distant home"
2282,MASSILIA,"Came to a world unknown, and wondering saw"
2283,MASSILIA,The shadows fall no longer to the left. (19)
2284,MASSILIA,Then fired with ardour for the Roman war
2285,MASSILIA,"Oretas came, and far Carmania's chiefs,"
2286,MASSILIA,"Whose clime lies southward, yet men thence descry"
2287,MASSILIA,"Low down the Pole star, and Bootes runs"
2288,MASSILIA,"Hasting to set, part seen, his nightly course;"
2289,MASSILIA,And Ethiopians from that southern land
2290,MASSILIA,"Which lies without the circuit of the stars,"
2291,MASSILIA,Did not the Bull with curving hoof advanced
2292,MASSILIA,O'erstep the limit.  From that mountain zone
2293,MASSILIA,"They come, where rising from a common fount"
2294,MASSILIA,"Euphrates flows and Tigris, and did earth"
2295,MASSILIA,"Permit, were joined with either name; but now"
2296,MASSILIA,While like th' Egyptian flood Euphrates spreads
2297,MASSILIA,"His fertilising water, Tigris first"
2298,MASSILIA,Drawn down by earth in covered depths is plunged
2299,MASSILIA,And holds a secret course; then born again
2300,MASSILIA,Flows on unhindered to the Persian sea.
2301,MASSILIA,
2302,MASSILIA,"But warlike Parthia wavered 'twixt the chiefs,"
2303,MASSILIA,Content to have made them two (20); while Scythia's hordes
2304,MASSILIA,"Dipped fresh their darts in poison, whom the stream"
2305,MASSILIA,Of Bactros bounds and vast Hyrcanian woods.
2306,MASSILIA,"Hence springs that rugged nation swift and fierce,"
2307,MASSILIA,Descended from the Twins' great charioteer. (21)
2308,MASSILIA,"Nor failed Sarmatia, nor the tribes that dwell"
2309,MASSILIA,"By richest Phasis, and on Halys' banks,"
2310,MASSILIA,Which sealed the doom of Croesus' king; nor where
2311,MASSILIA,"From far Rhipaean ranges Tanais flows,"
2312,MASSILIA,"On either hand a quarter of the world,"
2313,MASSILIA,"Asia and Europe, and in winding course"
2314,MASSILIA,Carves out a continent; nor where the strait
2315,MASSILIA,In boiling surge pours to the Pontic deep
2316,MASSILIA,"Maeotis' waters, rivalling the pride"
2317,MASSILIA,Of those Herculean pillar-gates that guard
2318,MASSILIA,The entrance to an ocean.  Thence with hair
2319,MASSILIA,"In golden fillets, Arimaspians came,"
2320,MASSILIA,"And fierce Massagetae, who quaff the blood"
2321,MASSILIA,Of the brave steed on which they fight and flee.
2322,MASSILIA,
2323,MASSILIA,Not when great Cyrus on Memnonian realms
2324,MASSILIA,"His warriors poured; nor when, their weapons piled, (22)"
2325,MASSILIA,The Persian told the number of his host;
2326,MASSILIA,Nor when th' avenger (23) of a brother's shame
2327,MASSILIA,"Loaded the billows with his mighty fleet,"
2328,MASSILIA,Beneath one chief so many kings made war;
2329,MASSILIA,Nor e'er met nations varied thus in garb
2330,MASSILIA,And thus in language.  To Pompeius' death
2331,MASSILIA,Thus Fortune called them: and a world in arms
2332,MASSILIA,"Witnessed his ruin.  From where Afric's god,"
2333,MASSILIA,"Two-horned Ammon, rears his temple, came"
2334,MASSILIA,"All Libya ceaseless, from the wastes that touch"
2335,MASSILIA,The bounds of Egypt to the shore that meets
2336,MASSILIA,"The Western Ocean.  Thus, to award the prize"
2337,MASSILIA,"Of Empire at one blow, Pharsalia brought"
2338,MASSILIA,'Neath Caesar's conquering hand the banded world.
2339,MASSILIA,
2340,MASSILIA,Now Caesar left the walls of trembling Rome
2341,MASSILIA,And swift across the cloudy Alpine tops
2342,MASSILIA,He winged his march; but while all others fled
2343,MASSILIA,"Far from his path, in terror of his name,"
2344,MASSILIA,Phocaea's (24) manhood with un-Grecian faith
2345,MASSILIA,"Held to their pledged obedience, and dared"
2346,MASSILIA,To follow right not fate; but first of all
2347,MASSILIA,With olive boughs of truce before them borne
2348,MASSILIA,"The chieftain they approach, with peaceful words"
2349,MASSILIA,In hope to alter his unbending will
2350,MASSILIA,"And tame his fury.  ""Search the ancient books"
2351,MASSILIA,Which chronicle the deeds of Latian fame;
2352,MASSILIA,"Thou'lt ever find, when foreign foes pressed hard,"
2353,MASSILIA,Massilia's prowess on the side of Rome.
2354,MASSILIA,"And now, if triumphs in an unknown world"
2355,MASSILIA,"Thou seekest, Caesar, here our arms and swords"
2356,MASSILIA,"Accept in aid: but if, in impious strife"
2357,MASSILIA,"Of civil discord, with a Roman foe"
2358,MASSILIA,"Thou seek'st to join in battle, weeping then"
2359,MASSILIA,We hold aloof: no stranger hand may touch
2360,MASSILIA,Celestial wounds.  Should all Olympus' hosts
2361,MASSILIA,"Have rushed to war, or should the giant brood"
2362,MASSILIA,"Assault the stars, yet men would not presume"
2363,MASSILIA,Or by their prayers or arms to help the gods:
2364,MASSILIA,"And, ignorant of the fortunes of the sky,"
2365,MASSILIA,"Taught by the thunderbolts alone, would know"
2366,MASSILIA,That Jupiter supreme still held the throne.
2367,MASSILIA,Add that unnumbered nations join the fray:
2368,MASSILIA,Nor shrinks the world so much from taint of crime
2369,MASSILIA,That civil wars reluctant swords require.
2370,MASSILIA,But grant that strangers shun thy destinies
2371,MASSILIA,And only Romans fight -- shall not the son
2372,MASSILIA,Shrink ere he strike his father?  on both sides
2373,MASSILIA,Brothers forbid the weapon to be hurled?
2374,MASSILIA,The world's end comes when other hands are armed (25)
2375,MASSILIA,Than those which custom and the gods allow.
2376,MASSILIA,"For us, this is our prayer: Leave, Caesar, here"
2377,MASSILIA,"Thy dreadful eagles, keep thy hostile signs"
2378,MASSILIA,"Back from our gates, but enter thou in peace"
2379,MASSILIA,Massilia's ramparts; let our city rest
2380,MASSILIA,"Withdrawn from crime, to Magnus and to thee"
2381,MASSILIA,Safe: and should favouring fate preserve our walls
2382,MASSILIA,"Inviolate, when both shall wish for peace"
2383,MASSILIA,Here meet unarmed.  Why hither turn'st thou now
2384,MASSILIA,Thy rapid march?  Nor weight nor power have we
2385,MASSILIA,To sway the mighty conflicts of the world.
2386,MASSILIA,We boast no victories since our fatherland
2387,MASSILIA,We left in exile: when Phocaea's fort
2388,MASSILIA,"Perished in flames, we sought another here;"
2389,MASSILIA,"And here on foreign shores, in narrow bounds"
2390,MASSILIA,"Confined and safe, our boast is sturdy faith;"
2391,MASSILIA,Nought else.  But if our city to blockade
2392,MASSILIA,"Is now thy mind -- to force the gates, and hurl"
2393,MASSILIA,Javelin and blazing torch upon our homes --
2394,MASSILIA,Do what thou wilt: cut off the source that fills
2395,MASSILIA,"Our foaming river, force us, prone in thirst,"
2396,MASSILIA,To dig the earth and lap the scanty pool;
2397,MASSILIA,Seize on our corn and leave us food abhorred:
2398,MASSILIA,"Nor shall this people shun, for freedom's sake,"
2399,MASSILIA,The ills Saguntum bore in Punic siege; (26)
2400,MASSILIA,"Torn, vainly clinging, from the shrunken breast"
2401,MASSILIA,The starving babe shall perish in the flames.
2402,MASSILIA,"Wives at their husbands' hands shall pray their fate,"
2403,MASSILIA,And brothers' weapons deal a mutual death.
2404,MASSILIA,"Such be our civil war; not, Caesar, thine."""
2405,MASSILIA,
2406,MASSILIA,But Caesar's visage stern betrayed his ire
2407,MASSILIA,"Which thus broke forth in words: ""Vain is the hope"
2408,MASSILIA,Ye rest upon my march: speed though I may
2409,MASSILIA,"Towards my western goal, time still remains"
2410,MASSILIA,"To blot Massilia out.  Rejoice, my troops!"
2411,MASSILIA,Unsought the war ye longed for meets you now:
2412,MASSILIA,The fates concede it.  As the tempests lose
2413,MASSILIA,"Their strength by sturdy forests unopposed,"
2414,MASSILIA,"And as the fire that finds no fuel dies,"
2415,MASSILIA,Even so to find no foe is Caesar's ill.
2416,MASSILIA,When those who may be conquered will not fight
2417,MASSILIA,"That is defeat.  Degenerate, disarmed"
2418,MASSILIA,"Their gates admit me!  Not content, forsooth,"
2419,MASSILIA,With shutting Caesar out they shut him in!
2420,MASSILIA,They shun the taint of war!  Such prayer for peace
2421,MASSILIA,Brings with it chastisement.  In Caesar's age
2422,MASSILIA,"Learn that not peace, but war within his ranks"
2423,MASSILIA,"Alone can make you safe."""
2424,MASSILIA,
2425,MASSILIA,Fearless he turns
2426,MASSILIA,"His march upon the city, and beholds"
2427,MASSILIA,"Fast barred the gate-ways, while in arms the youths"
2428,MASSILIA,Stand on the battlements.  Hard by the walls
2429,MASSILIA,"A hillock rose, upon the further side"
2430,MASSILIA,"Expanding in a plain of gentle slope,"
2431,MASSILIA,Fit (as he deemed it) for a camp with ditch
2432,MASSILIA,And mound encircling.  To a lofty height
2433,MASSILIA,"The nearest portion of the city rose,"
2434,MASSILIA,While intervening valleys lay between.
2435,MASSILIA,These summits with a mighty trench to bind
2436,MASSILIA,"The chief resolves, gigantic though the toil."
2437,MASSILIA,"But first, from furthest boundaries of his camp,"
2438,MASSILIA,"Enclosing streams and meadows, to the sea"
2439,MASSILIA,"To draw a rampart, upon either hand"
2440,MASSILIA,Heaved up with earthy sod; with lofty towers
2441,MASSILIA,Crowned; and to shut Massilia from the land.
2442,MASSILIA,
2443,MASSILIA,Then did the Grecian city win renown
2444,MASSILIA,"Eternal, deathless, for that uncompelled"
2445,MASSILIA,"Nor fearing for herself, but free to act"
2446,MASSILIA,She made the conqueror pause: and he who seized
2447,MASSILIA,All in resistless course found here delay:
2448,MASSILIA,"And Fortune, hastening to lay the world"
2449,MASSILIA,"Low at her favourite's feet, was forced to stay"
2450,MASSILIA,For these few moments her impatient hand.
2451,MASSILIA,
2452,MASSILIA,"Now fell the forests far and wide, despoiled"
2453,MASSILIA,Of all their giant trunks: for as the mound
2454,MASSILIA,"On earth and brushwood stood, a timber frame"
2455,MASSILIA,"Held firm the soil, lest pressed beneath its towers"
2456,MASSILIA,The mass might topple down.  There stood a grove
2457,MASSILIA,Which from the earliest time no hand of man
2458,MASSILIA,Had dared to violate; hidden from the sun (27)
2459,MASSILIA,Its chill recesses; matted boughs entwined
2460,MASSILIA,Prisoned the air within.  No sylvan nymphs
2461,MASSILIA,"Here found a home, nor Pan, but savage rites"
2462,MASSILIA,"And barbarous worship, altars horrible"
2463,MASSILIA,On massive stones upreared; sacred with blood
2464,MASSILIA,Of men was every tree.  If faith be given
2465,MASSILIA,"To ancient myth, no fowl has ever dared"
2466,MASSILIA,"To rest upon those branches, and no beast"
2467,MASSILIA,"Has made his lair beneath: no tempest falls,"
2468,MASSILIA,Nor lightnings flash upon it from the cloud.
2469,MASSILIA,"Stagnant the air, unmoving, yet the leaves"
2470,MASSILIA,Filled with mysterious trembling; dripped the streams
2471,MASSILIA,From coal-black fountains; effigies of gods
2472,MASSILIA,"Rude, scarcely fashioned from some fallen trunk"
2473,MASSILIA,"Held the mid space: and, pallid with decay,"
2474,MASSILIA,Their rotting shapes struck terror.  Thus do men
2475,MASSILIA,Dread most the god unknown.  'Twas said that caves
2476,MASSILIA,"Rumbled with earthquakes, that the prostrate yew"
2477,MASSILIA,Rose up again; that fiery tongues of flame
2478,MASSILIA,"Gleamed in the forest depths, yet were the trees"
2479,MASSILIA,Unkindled; and that snakes in frequent folds
2480,MASSILIA,Were coiled around the trunks.  Men flee the spot
2481,MASSILIA,Nor dare to worship near: and e'en the priest
2482,MASSILIA,"Or when bright Phoebus holds the height, or when"
2483,MASSILIA,"Dark night controls the heavens, in anxious dread"
2484,MASSILIA,Draws near the grove and fears to find its lord.
2485,MASSILIA,
2486,MASSILIA,"Spared in the former war, still dense it rose"
2487,MASSILIA,"Where all the hills were bare, and Caesar now"
2488,MASSILIA,Its fall commanded.  But the brawny arms
2489,MASSILIA,"Which swayed the axes trembled, and the men,"
2490,MASSILIA,"Awed by the sacred grove's dark majesty,"
2491,MASSILIA,Held back the blow they thought would be returned.
2492,MASSILIA,"This Caesar saw, and swift within his grasp"
2493,MASSILIA,"Uprose a ponderous axe, which downward fell"
2494,MASSILIA,"Cleaving a mighty oak that towered to heaven,"
2495,MASSILIA,"While thus he spake: ""Henceforth let no man dread"
2496,MASSILIA,To fell this forest: all the crime is mine.
2497,MASSILIA,"This be your creed.""  He spake, and all obeyed,"
2498,MASSILIA,For Caesar's ire weighed down the wrath of Heaven.
2499,MASSILIA,"Yet ceased they not to fear.  Then first the oak,"
2500,MASSILIA,Dodona's ancient boast; the knotty holm;
2501,MASSILIA,"The cypress, witness of patrician grief,"
2502,MASSILIA,"The buoyant alder, laid their foliage low"
2503,MASSILIA,Admitting day; though scarcely through the stems
2504,MASSILIA,Their fall found passage.  At the sight the Gauls
2505,MASSILIA,Grieved; but the garrison within the walls
2506,MASSILIA,Rejoiced: for thus shall men insult the gods
2507,MASSILIA,And find no punishment?  Yet fortune oft
2508,MASSILIA,Protects the guilty; on the poor alone
2509,MASSILIA,"The gods can vent their ire.  Enough hewn down,"
2510,MASSILIA,"They seize the country wagons; and the hind,"
2511,MASSILIA,"His oxen gone which else had drawn the plough,"
2512,MASSILIA,Mourns for his harvest.
2513,MASSILIA,
2514,MASSILIA,But the eager chief
2515,MASSILIA,Impatient of the combat by the walls
2516,MASSILIA,Carries the warfare to the furthest west.
2517,MASSILIA,
2518,MASSILIA,"Meanwhile a giant mound, on star-shaped wheels"
2519,MASSILIA,"Concealed, they fashion, crowned with double towers"
2520,MASSILIA,"High as the battlements, by cause unseen"
2521,MASSILIA,"Slow creeping onwards; while amazed the foe,"
2522,MASSILIA,"Beheld, and thought some subterranean gust"
2523,MASSILIA,Had burst the caverns of the earth and forced
2524,MASSILIA,"The nodding pile aloft, and wondered sore"
2525,MASSILIA,Their walls should stand unshaken.  From its height
2526,MASSILIA,Hissed clown the weapons; but the Grecian bolts
2527,MASSILIA,With greater force were on the Romans hurled;
2528,MASSILIA,"Nor by the arm unaided, for the lance"
2529,MASSILIA,Urged by the catapult resistless rushed
2530,MASSILIA,"Through arms and shield and flesh, and left a death"
2531,MASSILIA,"Behind, nor stayed its course: and massive stones"
2532,MASSILIA,Cast by the beams of mighty engines fell;
2533,MASSILIA,As from the mountain top some time-worn rock
2534,MASSILIA,"At length by winds dislodged, in all its track"
2535,MASSILIA,Spreads ruin vast: nor crushed the life alone
2536,MASSILIA,"Forth from the body, but dispersed the limbs"
2537,MASSILIA,In fragments undistinguished and in blood.
2538,MASSILIA,But as protected by the armour shield
2539,MASSILIA,The might of Rome drew nigh beneath the wall
2540,MASSILIA,(The front rank with their bucklers interlaced
2541,MASSILIA,"And held above their helms), the missiles fell"
2542,MASSILIA,"Behind their backs, nor could the toiling Greeks"
2543,MASSILIA,"Deflect their engines, throwing still the bolts"
2544,MASSILIA,Far into space; but from the rampart top
2545,MASSILIA,Flung ponderous masses down.  Long as the shields
2546,MASSILIA,"Held firm together, like to hail that falls"
2547,MASSILIA,"Harmless upon a roof, so long the stones"
2548,MASSILIA,Crushed down innocuous; but as the blows
2549,MASSILIA,"Rained fierce and ceaseless and the Romans tired,"
2550,MASSILIA,Some here and there sank fainting.  Next the roof
2551,MASSILIA,Advanced with earth besprinkled: underneath
2552,MASSILIA,"The ram conceals his head, which, poised and swung,"
2553,MASSILIA,"They dash with mighty force upon the wall,"
2554,MASSILIA,Covered themselves with mantlets.  Though the head
2555,MASSILIA,"Light on the lower stones, yet as the shock"
2556,MASSILIA,"Falls and refalls, from battlement to base"
2557,MASSILIA,The rampart soon shall topple.  But by balks
2558,MASSILIA,"And rocky fragments overwhelmed, and flames,"
2559,MASSILIA,The roof at length gave way; and worn with toil
2560,MASSILIA,"All spent in vain, the wearied troops withdrew"
2561,MASSILIA,And sought the shelter of their tents again.
2562,MASSILIA,
2563,MASSILIA,Thus far to hold their battlements was all
2564,MASSILIA,"The Greeks had hoped; now, venturing attack,"
2565,MASSILIA,"With glittering torches for their arms, by night"
2566,MASSILIA,Fearless they sallied forth: nor lance they bear
2567,MASSILIA,"Nor deadly bow, nor shaft; for fire alone"
2568,MASSILIA,Is now their weapon.  Through the Roman works
2569,MASSILIA,Driven by the wind the conflagration spread:
2570,MASSILIA,Nor did the newness of the wood make pause
2571,MASSILIA,"The fury of the flames, which, fed afresh"
2572,MASSILIA,"By living torches, 'neath a smoky pall"
2573,MASSILIA,Leaped on in fiery tongues.  Not wood alone
2574,MASSILIA,But stones gigantic crumbling into dust
2575,MASSILIA,Dissolved beneath the heat; the mighty mound
2576,MASSILIA,"Lay prone, yet in its ruin larger seemed."
2577,MASSILIA,
2578,MASSILIA,"Next, conquered on the land, upon the main"
2579,MASSILIA,They try their fortunes.  On their simple craft
2580,MASSILIA,No painted figure-head adorned the bows
2581,MASSILIA,"Nor claimed protection from the gods; but rude,"
2582,MASSILIA,"Just as they fell upon their mountain homes,"
2583,MASSILIA,"The trees were knit together, and the deck"
2584,MASSILIA,Gave steady foot-hold for an ocean fight.
2585,MASSILIA,
2586,MASSILIA,Meantime had Caesar's squadron kept the isles
2587,MASSILIA,"Named Stoechades (28), and Brutus (29) turret ship"
2588,MASSILIA,Mastered the Rhone.  Nor less the Grecian host --
2589,MASSILIA,"Boys not yet grown to war, and aged men,"
2590,MASSILIA,"Armed for the conflict, with their all at stake."
2591,MASSILIA,Nor only did they marshal for the fight
2592,MASSILIA,Ships meet for service; but their ancient keels
2593,MASSILIA,Brought from the dockyards.  When the morning rays
2594,MASSILIA,"Broke from the waters, and the sky was clear,"
2595,MASSILIA,"And all the winds were still upon the deep,"
2596,MASSILIA,"Smoothed for the battle, swift on either part"
2597,MASSILIA,The fleets essay the open; and the ships
2598,MASSILIA,"Tremble beneath the oars that urge them on,"
2599,MASSILIA,By sinewy arms impelled.  Upon the wings
2600,MASSILIA,"That bound the Roman fleet, the larger craft"
2601,MASSILIA,With triple and quadruple banks of oars
2602,MASSILIA,Gird in the lesser: so they front the sea;
2603,MASSILIA,"While in their rear, shaped as a crescent moon,"
2604,MASSILIA,Liburnian galleys follow.  Over all
2605,MASSILIA,Towers Brutus' deck praetorian.  Oars on oars
2606,MASSILIA,"Propel the bulky vessel through the main,"
2607,MASSILIA,Six ranks; the topmost strike the waves afar.
2608,MASSILIA,When such a space remained between the fleets
2609,MASSILIA,"As could be covered by a single stroke,"
2610,MASSILIA,Innumerable voices rose in air
2611,MASSILIA,Drowning with resonant din the beat of oars
2612,MASSILIA,And note of trumpet summoning: and all
2613,MASSILIA,Sat on the benches and with mighty stroke
2614,MASSILIA,Swept o'er the sea and gained the space between.
2615,MASSILIA,"Then crashed the prows together, and the keels"
2616,MASSILIA,"Rebounded backwards, and unnumbered darts"
2617,MASSILIA,"Or darkened all the sky or, in their fall,"
2618,MASSILIA,"The vacant ocean.  As the wings grew wide,"
2619,MASSILIA,"Less densely packed the fleet, some Grecian ships"
2620,MASSILIA,Pressed in between; as when with west and east
2621,MASSILIA,"The tide contends, this way the waves are driven"
2622,MASSILIA,And that the sea; so as they plough the deep
2623,MASSILIA,"In various lines converging, what the prow"
2624,MASSILIA,"Throws up advancing, from the foemen's oars"
2625,MASSILIA,Falls back repelled.  But soon the Grecian fleet
2626,MASSILIA,"Was handier found in battle, and in flight"
2627,MASSILIA,"Pretended, and in shorter curves could round;"
2628,MASSILIA,More deftly governed by the guiding helm:
2629,MASSILIA,While on the Roman side their steadier keels
2630,MASSILIA,"Gave vantage, as to men who fight on land."
2631,MASSILIA,Then Brutus to the pilot of his ship:
2632,MASSILIA,"""Dost suffer them to range the wider deep,"
2633,MASSILIA,Contending with the foe in naval skill?
2634,MASSILIA,Draw close the war and drive us on the prows
2635,MASSILIA,"Of these Phocaeans.""  Him the pilot heard;"
2636,MASSILIA,And turned his vessel slantwise to the foe.
2637,MASSILIA,Then was the sea all covered with the war:
2638,MASSILIA,Then Grecian ships attacking Brutus found
2639,MASSILIA,"Their ruin in the stroke, and vanquished lay"
2640,MASSILIA,Beside his bulwarks; while with grappling hooks
2641,MASSILIA,"Others laid fast the foe, themselves by oars"
2642,MASSILIA,Held back the while.  And now no outstretched arm
2643,MASSILIA,"Hurls forth the javelin, but hand to hand"
2644,MASSILIA,With swords they wage the fight: each from his ship
2645,MASSILIA,"Leans forward to the stroke, and falls when slain"
2646,MASSILIA,Upon a foeman's deck.  Deep flows the stream
2647,MASSILIA,Of purple slaughter to the foamy main:
2648,MASSILIA,"By piles of floating corpses are the sides,"
2649,MASSILIA,"Though grappled, kept asunder.  Some, half dead,"
2650,MASSILIA,"Plunge in the ocean, gulping down the brine"
2651,MASSILIA,Encrimsoned with their blood; some lingering still
2652,MASSILIA,Draw their last struggling breath amid the wreck
2653,MASSILIA,Of broken navies: weapons which have missed
2654,MASSILIA,"Find yet their victims, and the falling steel"
2655,MASSILIA,Fails not in middle deep to deal the wound.
2656,MASSILIA,One vessel circled by Phocaean keels
2657,MASSILIA,"Divides her strength, and on the right and left"
2658,MASSILIA,On either side with equal war contends;
2659,MASSILIA,On whose high poop while Tagus fighting gripped
2660,MASSILIA,"The stern Phocaean, pierced his back and breast"
2661,MASSILIA,Two fatal weapons; in the midst the steel
2662,MASSILIA,"Meets, and the blood, uncertain whence to flow,"
2663,MASSILIA,"Stands still, arrested, till with double course"
2664,MASSILIA,"Forth by a sudden gush it drives each dart,"
2665,MASSILIA,And sends the life abroad through either wound.
2666,MASSILIA,
2667,MASSILIA,Here fated Telon also steered his ship:
2668,MASSILIA,No pilot's hand upon an angry sea
2669,MASSILIA,"More deftly ruled a vessel.  Well he knew,"
2670,MASSILIA,"Or by the sun or crescent moon, how best"
2671,MASSILIA,To set his canvas fitted for the breeze
2672,MASSILIA,To-morrow's light would bring.  His rushing stem
2673,MASSILIA,Shattered a Roman vessel: but a dart
2674,MASSILIA,Hurled at the moment quivers in his breast.
2675,MASSILIA,"He falls, and in the fall his dying hand"
2676,MASSILIA,"Diverts the prow.  Then Gyareus, in act"
2677,MASSILIA,"To climb the friendly deck, by javelin pierced,"
2678,MASSILIA,"Still as he hung, by the retaining steel"
2679,MASSILIA,Fast to the side was nailed.
2680,MASSILIA,Twin brethren stand
2681,MASSILIA,"A fruitful mother's pride; with different fates,"
2682,MASSILIA,But ne'er distinguished till death's savage hand
2683,MASSILIA,"Struck once, and ended error: he that lived,"
2684,MASSILIA,"Cause of fresh anguish to their sorrowing souls,"
2685,MASSILIA,Called ever to the weeping parents back
2686,MASSILIA,"The image of the lost: who, as the oars"
2687,MASSILIA,"Grecian and Roman mixed their teeth oblique,"
2688,MASSILIA,Grasped with his dexter hand the Roman ship;
2689,MASSILIA,When fell a blow that shore his arm away.
2690,MASSILIA,"So died, upon the side it held, the hand,"
2691,MASSILIA,Nor loosed its grasp in death.  Yet with the wound
2692,MASSILIA,"His noble courage rose, and maimed he dared"
2693,MASSILIA,"Renew the fray, and stretched across the sea"
2694,MASSILIA,To grasp the lost -- in vain!  another blow
2695,MASSILIA,Lopped arm and hand alike.  Nor shield nor sword
2696,MASSILIA,Henceforth are his.  Yet even now he seeks
2697,MASSILIA,"No sheltering hold, but with his chest advanced"
2698,MASSILIA,"Before his brother armed, he claims the fight,"
2699,MASSILIA,And holding in his breast the darts which else
2700,MASSILIA,"Had slain his comrades, pierced with countless spears,"
2701,MASSILIA,He fails in death well earned; yet ere his end
2702,MASSILIA,"Collects his parting life, and all his strength"
2703,MASSILIA,Strains to the utmost and with failing limbs
2704,MASSILIA,Leaps on the foeman's deck; by weight alone
2705,MASSILIA,Injurious; for streaming down with gore
2706,MASSILIA,"And piled on high with corpses, while her sides"
2707,MASSILIA,"Sounded to ceaseless blows, the fated ship"
2708,MASSILIA,Let in the greedy brine until her ways
2709,MASSILIA,Were level with the waters -- then she plunged
2710,MASSILIA,In whirling eddies downwards -- and the main
2711,MASSILIA,"First parted, then closed in upon its prey."
2712,MASSILIA,
2713,MASSILIA,"Full many wondrous deaths, with fates diverse,"
2714,MASSILIA,Upon the sea in that day's fight befell.
2715,MASSILIA,"Caught by a grappling-hook that missed the side,"
2716,MASSILIA,Had Lysidas been whelmed in middle deep;
2717,MASSILIA,"But by his feet his comrades dragged him back,"
2718,MASSILIA,And rent in twain he hung; nor slowly flowed
2719,MASSILIA,As from a wound the blood; but all his veins (30)
2720,MASSILIA,Were torn asunder and the stream of life
2721,MASSILIA,Gushed o'er his limbs till lost amid the deep.
2722,MASSILIA,From no man dying has the vital breath
2723,MASSILIA,Rushed by so wide a path; the lower trunk
2724,MASSILIA,"Succumbed to death, but with the lungs and heart"
2725,MASSILIA,"Long strove the fates, and hardly won the whole."
2726,MASSILIA,
2727,MASSILIA,"While, bent upon the fight, an eager crew"
2728,MASSILIA,Were gathered to the margin of their deck
2729,MASSILIA,"(Leaving the upper side as bare of foes),"
2730,MASSILIA,Their ship was overset.  Beneath the keel
2731,MASSILIA,"Which floated upwards, prisoned in the sea,"
2732,MASSILIA,And powerless by spread of arms to float
2733,MASSILIA,"The main, they perished.  One who haply swam"
2734,MASSILIA,"Amid the battle, chanced upon a death"
2735,MASSILIA,Strange and unheard of; for two meeting prows
2736,MASSILIA,Transfixed his body.  At the double stroke
2737,MASSILIA,Wide yawned his chest; blood issued from his mouth
2738,MASSILIA,With flesh commingled; and the brazen beaks
2739,MASSILIA,"Resounding clashed together, by the bones"
2740,MASSILIA,Unhindered: now they part and through the gap
2741,MASSILIA,Swift pours the sea and drags the corse below.
2742,MASSILIA,"Next, of a shipwrecked crew, the larger part"
2743,MASSILIA,"Struggling with death upon the waters, reached"
2744,MASSILIA,A comrade bark; but when with elbows raised do
2745,MASSILIA,They seized upon the bulwarks and the ship
2746,MASSILIA,"Rolled, nor could bear their weight, the ruthless crew"
2747,MASSILIA,Hacked off their straining arms; then maimed they sank
2748,MASSILIA,"Below the seething waves, to rise no more."
2749,MASSILIA,
2750,MASSILIA,"Now every dart was hurled and every spear,"
2751,MASSILIA,The soldier weaponless; yet their rage found arms:
2752,MASSILIA,One hurls an oar; another's brawny arm
2753,MASSILIA,Tugs at the twisted stern; or from the seats
2754,MASSILIA,"The oarsmen driving, swings a bench in air."
2755,MASSILIA,The ships are broken for the fight.  They seize
2756,MASSILIA,The fallen dead and snatch the sword that slew.
2757,MASSILIA,"Nay, many from their wounds, frenzied for arms,"
2758,MASSILIA,"Pluck forth the deadly steel, and pressing still"
2759,MASSILIA,"Upon their yawning sides, hurl forth the spear"
2760,MASSILIA,Back to the hostile ranks from which it came;
2761,MASSILIA,Then ebbs their life blood forth.
2762,MASSILIA,
2763,MASSILIA,But deadlier yet
2764,MASSILIA,Was that fell force most hostile to the sea;
2765,MASSILIA,"For, thrown in torches and in sulphurous bolts"
2766,MASSILIA,"Fire all-consuming ran among the ships,"
2767,MASSILIA,Whose oily timbers soaked in pitch and wax
2768,MASSILIA,"Inflammable, gave welcome to the flames."
2769,MASSILIA,Nor could the waves prevail against the blaze
2770,MASSILIA,Which claimed as for its own the fragments borne
2771,MASSILIA,Upon the waters.  Lo!  on burning plank
2772,MASSILIA,One hardly 'scapes destruction; one to save
2773,MASSILIA,"His flaming ship, gives entrance to the main."
2774,MASSILIA,Of all the forms of death each fears the one
2775,MASSILIA,That brings immediate dying: yet quails not
2776,MASSILIA,Their heart in shipwreck: from the waves they pluck
2777,MASSILIA,The fallen darts and furnishing the ship
2778,MASSILIA,Essay the feeble stroke; and should that hope
2779,MASSILIA,"Still fail their hand, they call the sea to aid"
2780,MASSILIA,And seizing in their grasp some floating foe
2781,MASSILIA,Drag him to mutual death.
2782,MASSILIA,
2783,MASSILIA,But on that day
2784,MASSILIA,Phoceus above all others proved his skill.
2785,MASSILIA,Well trained was he to dive beneath the main
2786,MASSILIA,And search the waters with unfailing eye;
2787,MASSILIA,And should an anchor 'gainst the straining rope
2788,MASSILIA,"Too firmly bite the sands, to wrench it free."
2789,MASSILIA,Oft in his fatal grasp he seized a foe
2790,MASSILIA,Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone.
2791,MASSILIA,Such was his frequent deed; but this his fate:
2792,MASSILIA,"For rising, victor (as he thought), to air,"
2793,MASSILIA,Full on a keel he struck and found his death.
2794,MASSILIA,"Some, drowning, seized a hostile oar and checked"
2795,MASSILIA,"The flying vessel; not to die in vain,"
2796,MASSILIA,Their single care; some on their vessel's side
2797,MASSILIA,"Hanging, in death, with wounded frame essayed"
2798,MASSILIA,To check the charging prow.
2799,MASSILIA,
2800,MASSILIA,Tyrrhenus high
2801,MASSILIA,Upon the bulwarks of his ship was struck
2802,MASSILIA,By leaden bolt from Balearic sling
2803,MASSILIA,Of Lygdamus; straight through his temples passed
2804,MASSILIA,The fated missile; and in streams of blood
2805,MASSILIA,Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballs fell.
2806,MASSILIA,"Plunged in a darkness as of night, he thought"
2807,MASSILIA,That life had left him; yet ere long he knew
2808,MASSILIA,"The living rigour of his limbs; and cried,"
2809,MASSILIA,"""Place me, O friends, as some machine of war"
2810,MASSILIA,Straight facing towards the foe; then shall my darts
2811,MASSILIA,"Strike as of old; and thou, Tyrrhenus, spend"
2812,MASSILIA,"Thy latest breath, still left, upon the fight:"
2813,MASSILIA,"So shalt thou play, not wholly dead, the part"
2814,MASSILIA,"That fits a soldier, and the spear that strikes"
2815,MASSILIA,"Thy frame, shall miss the living.""  Thus he spake,"
2816,MASSILIA,"And hurled his javelin, blind, but not in vain;"
2817,MASSILIA,"For Argus, generous youth of noble blood,"
2818,MASSILIA,Below the middle waist received the spear
2819,MASSILIA,And failing drave it home.  His aged sire
2820,MASSILIA,From furthest portion of the conquered ship
2821,MASSILIA,"Beheld; than whom in prime of manhood none,"
2822,MASSILIA,"More brave in battle: now no more he fought,"
2823,MASSILIA,Yet did the memory of his prowess stir
2824,MASSILIA,Phocaean youths to emulate his fame.
2825,MASSILIA,Oft stumbling o'er the benches the old man hastes
2826,MASSILIA,"To reach his boy, and finds him breathing still."
2827,MASSILIA,"No tear bedewed his cheek, nor on his breast"
2828,MASSILIA,"One blow he struck, but o'er his eyes there fell"
2829,MASSILIA,A dark impenetrable veil of mist
2830,MASSILIA,That blotted out the day; nor could he more
2831,MASSILIA,"Discern his luckless Argus.  He, who saw"
2832,MASSILIA,"His parent, raising up his drooping head"
2833,MASSILIA,With parted lips and silent features asks
2834,MASSILIA,"A father's latest kiss, a father's hand"
2835,MASSILIA,"To close his dying eyes.  But soon his sire,"
2836,MASSILIA,"Recovering from his swoon, when ruthless grief"
2837,MASSILIA,"Possessed his spirit, ""This short space,"" he cried,"
2838,MASSILIA,"""I lose not, which the cruel gods have given,"
2839,MASSILIA,But die before thee.  Grant thy sorrowing sire
2840,MASSILIA,Forgiveness that he fled thy last embrace.
2841,MASSILIA,Not yet has passed thy life blood from the wound
2842,MASSILIA,Nor yet is death upon thee -- still thou may'st (31)
2843,MASSILIA,"Outlive thy parent."" Thus he spake, and seized"
2844,MASSILIA,"The reeking sword and drave it to the hilt,"
2845,MASSILIA,"Then plunged into the deep, with headlong bound,"
2846,MASSILIA,To anticipate his son: for this he feared
2847,MASSILIA,A single form of death should not suffice.
2848,MASSILIA,
2849,MASSILIA,"Now gave the fates their judgment, and in doubt"
2850,MASSILIA,No longer was the war: the Grecian fleet
2851,MASSILIA,In most part sunk; -- some ships by Romans oared
2852,MASSILIA,Conveyed the victors home: in headlong flight
2853,MASSILIA,Some sought the yards for shelter.  On the strand
2854,MASSILIA,"What tears of parents for their offspring slain,"
2855,MASSILIA,How wept the mothers!  'Mid the pile confused
2856,MASSILIA,Ofttimes the wife sought madly for her spouse
2857,MASSILIA,And chose for her last kiss some Roman slain;
2858,MASSILIA,While wretched fathers by the blazing pyres
2859,MASSILIA,Fought for the dead.  But Brutus thus at sea
2860,MASSILIA,First gained a triumph for great Caesar's arms. (32)

4205,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Stifled the god; perhaps the breath divine
4206,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Has left its ancient gorge and thro' the world
4207,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Wanders in devious paths; or else the fane,"
4208,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Consumed to ashes by barbarian (14) fire,"
4209,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Closed up the deep recess and choked the path
4210,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of Phoebus; or the ancient Sibyl's books
4211,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Disclosed enough of fate, and thus the gods"
4212,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Decreed to close the oracle; or else
4213,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Since wicked steps are banished from the fane,"
4214,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In this our impious age the god finds none
4215,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Whom he may answer.""  But the maiden's guile"
4216,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Was known, for though she would deny the gods"
4217,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Her fears approved them.  On her front she binds
4218,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"A twisted fillet, while a shining wreath"
4219,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of Phocian laurels crowns the locks that flow
4220,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Upon her shoulders.  Hesitating yet
4221,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The priest compelled her, and she passed within."
4222,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But horror filled her of the holiest depths
4223,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From which the mystic oracle proceeds;
4224,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And resting near the doors, in breast unmoved"
4225,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"She dares invent the god in words confused,"
4226,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Which proved no mind possessed with fire divine;
4227,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,By such false chant less injuring the chief
4228,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Than faith in Phoebus and the sacred fane.
4229,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"No burst of words with tremor in their tones,"
4230,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,No voice re-echoing through the spacious vault
4231,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Proclaimed the deity, no bristling locks"
4232,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Shook off the laurel chaplet; but the grove
4233,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Unshaken, and the summits of the shrine,"
4234,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Gave proof she shunned the god.  The Roman knew
4235,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The tripods yet were idle, and in rage,"
4236,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Wretch,"" he exclaimed, ""to us and to the gods,"
4237,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Whose presence thou pretendest, thou shalt pay"
4238,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For this thy fraud the punishment; unless
4239,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thou enter the recess, and speak no more,"
4240,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of this world-war, this tumult of mankind,"
4241,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thine own inventions.""  Then by fear compelled,"
4242,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"At length the priestess sought the furthest depths,"
4243,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And stayed beside the tripods; and there came
4244,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Into her unaccustomed breast the god,"
4245,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Breathed from the living rock for centuries
4246,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Untouched; nor ever with a mightier power
4247,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Did Paean's inspiration seize the frame
4248,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of Delphic priestess; his pervading touch
4249,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Drove out her former mind, expelled the man,"
4250,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And made her wholly his.  In maddened trance
4251,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"She whirls throughout the cave, her locks erect"
4252,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With horror, and the fillets of the god"
4253,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Dashed to the ground; her steps unguided turn
4254,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To this side and to that; the tripods fall
4255,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,O'erturned; within her seethes the mighty fire
4256,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of angry Phoebus; nor with whip alone
4257,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"He urged her onwards, but with curb restrained;"
4258,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor was it given her by the god to speak
4259,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,All that she knew; for into one vast mass (15)
4260,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"All time was gathered, and her panting chest"
4261,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Groaned 'neath the centuries.  In order long
4262,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,All things lay bare: the future yet unveiled
4263,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Struggled for light; each fate required a voice;
4264,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The compass of the seas, Creation's birth,"
4265,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Creation's death, the number of the sands,"
4266,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,All these she knew.  Thus on a former day
4267,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The prophetess upon the Cuman shore, (16)"
4268,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Disdaining that her frenzy should be slave
4269,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To other nations, from the boundless threads"
4270,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Chose out with pride of hand the fates of Rome.
4271,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"E'en so Phemonoe, for a time oppressed"
4272,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With fates unnumbered, laboured ere she found,"
4273,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Beneath such mighty destinies concealed,"
4274,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thine, Appius, who alone had'st sought the god"
4275,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In land Castalian; then from foaming lips
4276,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"First rushed the madness forth, and murmurs loud"
4277,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Uttered with panting breath and blent with groans;
4278,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Till through the spacious vault a voice at length
4279,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Broke from the virgin conquered by the god:
4280,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""From this great struggle thou, O Roman, free"
4281,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Escap'st the threats of war: alive, in peace,"
4282,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thou shalt possess the hollow in the coast
4283,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of vast Euboea.""  Thus she spake, no more."
4284,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4285,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Ye mystic tripods, guardians of the fates"
4286,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And Paean, thou, from whom no day is hid"
4287,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"By heaven's high rulers, Master of the truth,"
4288,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Why fear'st thou to reveal the deaths of kings,"
4289,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Rome's murdered princes, and the latest doom"
4290,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of her great Empire tottering to its fall,"
4291,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And all the bloodshed of that western land?
4292,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Were yet the stars in doubt on Magnus' fate
4293,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not yet decreed, and did the gods yet shrink"
4294,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"From that, the greatest crime?  Or wert thou dumb"
4295,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That Fortune's sword for civil strife might wreak
4296,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Just vengeance, and a Brutus' arm once more"
4297,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Strike down the tyrant?
4298,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4299,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From the temple doors
4300,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Rushed forth the prophetess in frenzy driven,"
4301,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not all her knowledge uttered; and her eyes,"
4302,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Still troubled by the god who reigned within,"
4303,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Or filled with wild affright, or fired with rage"
4304,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Gaze on the wide expanse: still works her face
4305,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Convulsive; on her cheeks a crimson blush
4306,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With ghastly pallor blent, though not of fear."
4307,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Her weary heart throbs ever; and as seas
4308,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Boom swollen by northern winds, she finds in sighs,"
4309,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"All inarticulate, relief.  But while"
4310,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,She hastes from that dread light in which she saw
4311,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The fates, to common day, lo!  on her path"
4312,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The darkness fell.  Then by a Stygian draught
4313,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of the forgetful river, Phoebus snatched"
4314,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Back from her soul his secrets; and she fell
4315,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Yet hardly living.
4316,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4317,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor did Appius dread
4318,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Approaching death, but by dark oracles"
4319,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Baffled, while yet the Empire of the world"
4320,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Hung in the balance, sought his promised realm"
4321,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In Chalcis of Euboea.  Yet to escape
4322,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"All ills of earth, the crash of war -- what god"
4323,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Can give thee such a boon, but death alone?"
4324,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Far on the solitary shore a grave
4325,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Awaits thee, where Carystos' marble crags (17)"
4326,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Draw in the passage of the sea, and where"
4327,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The fane of Rhamnus rises to the gods
4328,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Who hate the proud, and where the ocean strait"
4329,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Boils in swift whirlpools, and Euripus draws"
4330,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Deceitful in his tides, a bane to ships,"
4331,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Chalcidian vessels to bleak Aulis' shore.
4332,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4333,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But Caesar carried from the conquered west
4334,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,His eagles to another world of war;
4335,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When envying his victorious course the gods
4336,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Almost turned back the prosperous tide of fate.
4337,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not on the battle-field borne down by arms
4338,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But in his tents, within the rampart lines,"
4339,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The hoped-for prize of this unholy war
4340,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Seemed for a moment gone.  That faithful host,"
4341,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"His comrades trusted in a hundred fields,"
4342,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Or that the falchion sheathed had lost its charm;
4343,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Or weary of the mournful bugle call
4344,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Scarce ever silent; or replete with blood,"
4345,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Well nigh betrayed their general and sold
4346,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For hope of gain their honour and their cause.
4347,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,No other perilous shock gave surer proof
4348,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,How trembled 'neath his feet the dizzy height
4349,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From which great Caesar looked.  A moment since
4350,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,His high behest drew nations to the field:
4351,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Now, maimed of all, he sees that swords once drawn"
4352,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Are weapons for the soldier, not the chief."
4353,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From the stern ranks no doubtful murmur rose;
4354,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not silent anger as when one conspires,"
4355,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"His comrades doubting, feared himself in turn;"
4356,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Alone (he thinks) indignant at the wrongs
4357,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Wrought by the despot.  In so great a host
4358,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Dread found no place.  Where thousands share the guilt
4359,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Crime goes unpunished.  Thus from dauntless throats
4360,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"They hurled their menace: ""Caesar, give us leave"
4361,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To quit thy crimes; thou seek'st by land and sea
4362,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The sword to slay us; let the fields of Gaul
4363,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And far Iberia, and the world proclaim"
4364,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,How for thy victories our comrades fell.
4365,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,What boots it us that by an army's blood
4366,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The Rhine and Rhone and all the northern lands
4367,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thou hast subdued?  Thou giv'st us civil war
4368,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For all these battles; such the prize.  When fled
4369,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The Senate trembling, and when Rome was ours"
4370,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,What homes or temples did we spoil?  Our hands
4371,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Reek with offence!  Aye, but our poverty"
4372,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Proclaims our innocence!  What end shall be
4373,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of arms and armies?  What shall be enough
4374,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,If Rome suffice not?  and what lies beyond?
4375,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Behold these silvered locks, these nerveless hands"
4376,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And shrunken arms, once stalwart!  In thy wars"
4377,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Gone is the strength of life, gone all its pride!"
4378,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Dismiss thine aged soldiers to their deaths.
4379,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,How shameless is our prayer!  Not on hard turf
4380,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To stretch our dying limbs; nor seek in vain,"
4381,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When parts the soul, a hand to close our eyes;"
4382,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not with the helmet strike the stony clod: (19)
4383,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Rather to feel the dear one's last embrace,"
4384,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And gain a humble but a separate tomb.
4385,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Let nature end old age.  And dost thou think
4386,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,We only know not what degree of crime
4387,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Will fetch the highest price?  What thou canst dare
4388,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"These years have proved, or nothing; law divine"
4389,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor human ordinance shall hold thine hand.
4390,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thou wert our leader on the banks of Rhine;
4391,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Henceforth our equal; for the stain of crime
4392,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Makes all men like to like.  Add that we serve
4393,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,A thankless chief: as fortune's gift he takes
4394,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The fruits of victory our arms have won.
4395,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"We are his fortunes, and his fates are ours"
4396,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To fashion as we will.  Boast that the gods
4397,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shall do thy bidding!  Nay, thy soldiers' will"
4398,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shall close the war.""  With threatening mien and speech"
4399,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thus through the camp the troops demand their chief.
4400,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4401,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When faith and loyalty are fled, and hope"
4402,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"For aught but evil, thus may civil war"
4403,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In mutiny and discord find its end!
4404,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,What general had not feared at such revolt?
4405,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But mighty Caesar trusting on the throw,"
4406,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"As was his wont, his fortune, and o'erjoyed"
4407,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To front their anger raging at its height
4408,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Unflinching comes.  No temples of the gods,"
4409,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not Jove's high fane on the Tarpeian rock,"
4410,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not Rome's high dames nor maidens had he grudged
4411,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To their most savage lust: that they should ask
4412,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The worst, his wish, and love the spoils of war."
4413,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor feared he aught save order at the hands
4414,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of that unconquered host.  Art thou not shamed
4415,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"That strife should please thee only, now condemned"
4416,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Even by thy minions?  Shall they shrink from blood,"
4417,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,They from the sword recoil?  and thou rush on
4418,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Heedless of guilt, through right and through unright,"
4419,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor learn that men may lay their arms aside
4420,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Yet bear to live?  This civil butchery
4421,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Escapes thy grasp.  Stay thou thy crimes at length;
4422,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor force thy will on those who will no more.
4423,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4424,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Upon a turfy mound unmoved he stood
4425,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And, since he feared not, worthy to be feared;"
4426,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And thus while anger stirred his soul began:
4427,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Thou that with voice and hand didst rage but now"
4428,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Against thine absent chief, behold me here;"
4429,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Here strike thy sword into this naked breast,"
4430,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To stay the war; and flee, if such thy wish."
4431,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,This mutiny devoid of daring deed
4432,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Betrays your coward souls, betrays the youth"
4433,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Who tires of victories which gild the arms
4434,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of an unconquered chief, and yearns for flight."
4435,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Well, leave me then to battle and to fate!"
4436,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"I cast you forth; for every weapon left,"
4437,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Fortune shall find a man, to wield it well."
4438,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Shall Magnus in his flight with such a fleet
4439,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Draw nations in his train; and not to me as
4440,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"My victories bring hosts, to whom shall fall"
4441,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The prize of war accomplished, who shall reap"
4442,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Your laurels scorned, and scathless join the train"
4443,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That leads my chariot to the sacred hill?
4444,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"While you, despised in age and worn in war,"
4445,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Gaze on our triumph from the civic crowd.
4446,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Think you your dastard flight shall give me pause?
4447,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,If all the rivers that now seek the sea
4448,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Were to withdraw their waters, it would fail"
4449,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"By not one inch, no more than by their flow"
4450,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,It rises now.  Have then your efforts given
4451,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Strength to my cause?  Not so: the heavenly gods
4452,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Stoop not so low; fate has no time to judge
4453,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Your lives and deaths.  The fortunes of the world
4454,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Follow heroic souls: for the fit few
4455,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The many live; and you who terrified
4456,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With me the northern and Iberian worlds,"
4457,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Would flee when led by Magnus.  Strong in arms
4458,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For Caesar's cause was Labienus; (20) now
4459,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"That vile deserter, with his chief preferred,"
4460,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Wanders o'er land and sea.  Nor were your faith
4461,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"One whit more firm to me if, neither side"
4462,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Espoused, you ceased from arms.  Who leaves me once,"
4463,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Though not to fight against me with the foe,"
4464,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Joins not my ranks again.  Surely the gods
4465,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Smile on these arms who for so great a war
4466,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Grant me fresh soldiers.  From what heavy load
4467,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Fortune relieves me!  for the hands which aimed
4468,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"At all, to which the world did not suffice,"
4469,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"I now disarm, and for myself alone"
4470,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Reserve the conflict.  Quit ye, then, my camp,"
4471,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"'Quirites', (21) Caesar's soldiers now no more,"
4472,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And leave my standards to the grasp of men!
4473,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Yet some who led this mad revolt I hold,"
4474,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not as their captain now, but as their judge."
4475,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Lie, traitors, prone on earth, stretch out the neck"
4476,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And take th' avenging blow.  And thou whose strength
4477,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shall now support me, young and yet untaught,"
4478,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Behold the doom and learn to strike and die."""
4479,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4480,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Such were his words of ire, and all the host"
4481,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Drew back and trembled at the voice of him
4482,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"They would depose, as though their very swords"
4483,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Would from their scabbards leap at his command
4484,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Themselves unwilling; but he only feared
4485,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Lest hand and blade to satisfy the doom
4486,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Might be denied, till they submitting pledged"
4487,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Their lives and swords alike, beyond his hope."
4488,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To strike and suffer (22) holds in surest thrall
4489,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The heart inured to guilt; and Caesar kept,"
4490,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"By dreadful compact ratified in blood,"
4491,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Those whom he feared to lose.
4492,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4493,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,He bids them march
4494,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Upon Brundusium, and recalls the ships"
4495,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From soft Calabria's inlets and the point
4496,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of Leucas, and the Salapinian marsh,"
4497,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Where sheltered Sipus nestles at the feet
4498,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of rich Garganus, jutting from the shore"
4499,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In huge escarpment that divides the waves
4500,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of Hadria; on each hand, his seaward slopes"
4501,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Buffeted by the winds; or Auster borne
4502,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"From sweet Apulia, or the sterner blast"
4503,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of Boreas rushing from Dalmatian strands.
4504,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4505,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But Caesar entered trembling Rome unarmed,"
4506,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Now taught to serve him in the garb of peace.
4507,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Dictator named, to grant their prayers, forsooth:"
4508,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Consul, in honour of the roll of Rome."
4509,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Then first of all the names by which we now
4510,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Lie to our masters, men found out the use:"
4511,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For to preserve his right to wield the sword
4512,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,He mixed the civil axes with his brands;
4513,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With eagles, fasces; with an empty word"
4514,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Clothing his power; and stamped upon the time
4515,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,A worthy designation; for what name
4516,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Could better mark the dread Pharsalian year
4517,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Than ""Caesar, Consul""?  (23) Now the famous field"
4518,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Pretends its ancient ceremonies: calls
4519,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The tribes in order and divides the votes
4520,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In vain solemnity of empty urns.
4521,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor do they heed the portents of the sky:
4522,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Deaf were the augurs to the thunder roll;
4523,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The owl flew on the left; yet were the birds
4524,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Propitious sworn.  Then was the ancient name
4525,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Degraded first; and monthly Consuls, (24)"
4526,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shorn of their rank, are chosen to mark the years."
4527,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And Trojan Alba's (25) god (since Latium's fall
4528,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Deserving not) beheld the wonted fires
4529,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Blaze from his altars on the festal night.
4530,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4531,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Then through Apulia's fallows, that her hinds"
4532,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Left all untilled, to sluggish weeds a prey"
4533,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Passed Caesar onward, swifter than the fire"
4534,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of heaven, or tigress dam: until he reached"
4535,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Brundusium's winding ramparts, built of old"
4536,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,By Cretan colonists.  There icy winds
4537,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Constrained the billows, and his trembling fleet"
4538,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Feared for the winter storms nor dared the main.
4539,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But Caesar's soul burned at the moments lost
4540,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"For speedy battle, nor could brook delay"
4541,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Within the port, indignant that the sea"
4542,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Should give safe passage to his routed foe:
4543,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And thus he stirred his troops, in seas unskilled,"
4544,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With words of courage: ""When the winter wind"
4545,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Has seized on sky and ocean, firm its hold;"
4546,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But the inconstancy of cloudy spring
4547,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Permits no certain breezes to prevail
4548,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Upon the billows.  Straight shall be our course.
4549,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"No winding nooks of coast, but open seas"
4550,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Struck by the northern wind alone we plough,"
4551,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And may he bend the spars, and bear us swift"
4552,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To Grecian cities; else Pompeius' oars,"
4553,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Smiting the billows from Phaeacian (26) coasts,"
4554,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,May catch our flagging sails.  Cast loose the ropes
4555,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From our victorious prows.  Too long we waste
4556,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Tempests that blow to bear us to our goal."""
4557,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4558,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Now sank the sun to rest; the evening star
4559,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shone on the darkening heaven, and the moon"
4560,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Reigned with her paler light, when all the fleet"
4561,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Freed from retaining cables seized the main.
4562,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With slackened sheet the canvas wooed the breeze,"
4563,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Which rose and fell and fitful died away,"
4564,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Till motionless the sails, and all the waves"
4565,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Were still as deepest pool, where never wind"
4566,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Ripples the surface.  Thus in Scythian climes
4567,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Cimmerian Bosphorus restrains the deep
4568,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Bound fast in frosty fetters; Ister's streams (27)
4569,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"No more impel the main, and ships constrained"
4570,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Stand fast in ice; and while in depths below
4571,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The waves still murmur, loud the charger's hoof"
4572,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Sounds on the surface, and the travelling wheel"
4573,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Furrows a track upon the frozen marsh.
4574,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Cruel as tempest was the calm that lay
4575,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In stagnant pools upon the mournful deep:
4576,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Against the course of nature lay outstretched
4577,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,A rigid ocean: 'twas as if the sea
4578,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Forgat its ancient ways and knew no more
4579,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The ceaseless tides, nor any breeze of heaven,"
4580,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Nor quivered at the image of the sun,"
4581,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Mirrored upon its wave.  For while the fleet
4582,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Hung in mid passage motionless, the foe"
4583,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Might hurry to attack, with sturdy stroke"
4584,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Churning the deep; or famine's deadly grip
4585,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Might seize the ships becalmed.  For dangers new
4586,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"New vows they find.  ""May mighty winds arise"
4587,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And rouse the ocean, and this sluggish plain"
4588,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Cast off stagnation and be sea once more."""
4589,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thus did they pray, but cloudless shone the sky,"
4590,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Unrippled slept the surface of the main;
4591,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Until in misty clouds the moon arose
4592,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And stirred the depths, and moved the fleet along"
4593,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Towards the Ceraunian headland; and the waves
4594,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And favouring breezes followed on the ships,"
4595,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Now speeding faster, till (their goal attained)"
4596,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,They cast their anchors on Palaeste's (28) shore.
4597,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4598,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,This land first saw the chiefs in neighbouring camps
4599,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Confronted, which the streams of Apsus bound"
4600,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And swifter Genusus; a lengthy course
4601,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Is run by neither, but on Apsus' waves"
4602,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Scarce flowing from a marsh, the frequent boat"
4603,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Finds room to swim; while on the foamy bed
4604,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of Genusus by sun or shower compelled
4605,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The melted snows pour seawards.  Here were met
4606,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,(So Fortune ordered it) the mighty pair;
4607,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And in its woes the world yet vainly hoped
4608,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That brought to nearer touch their crime itself
4609,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Might bleed abhorrence: for from either camp
4610,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Voices were clearly heard and features seen.
4611,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Nor e'er, Pompeius, since that distant day"
4612,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When Caesar's daughter and thy spouse was reft
4613,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"By pitiless fate away, nor left a pledge,"
4614,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Did thy loved kinsman (save on sands of Nile)
4615,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,So nearly look upon thy face again.
4616,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4617,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But Caesar's mind though frenzied for the fight
4618,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Was forced to pause until Antonius brought
4619,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The rearward troops; Antonius even now
4620,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Rehearsing Leucas' fight.  With prayers and threats
4621,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Caesar exhorts him.  ""Why delay the fates,"
4622,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thou cause of evil to the suffering world?
4623,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,My speed hath won the major part: from thee
4624,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Fortune demands the final stroke alone.
4625,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Do Libyan whirlpools with deceitful tides
4626,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Uncertain separate us?  Is the deep
4627,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Untried to which I call?  To unknown risks
4628,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Art thou commanded?  Caesar bids thee come,"
4629,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thou sluggard, not to leave him.  Long ago"
4630,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,I ran my ships midway through sands and shoals
4631,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To harbours held by foes; and dost thou fear
4632,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,My friendly camp?  I mourn the waste of days
4633,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Which fate allotted us.  Upon the waves
4634,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And winds I call unceasing: hold not back
4635,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thy willing troops, but let them dare the sea;"
4636,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Here gladly shall they come to join my camp,"
4637,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Though risking shipwreck.  Not in equal shares
4638,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The world has fallen between us: thou alone
4639,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Dost hold Italia, but Epirus I"
4640,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And all the lords of Rome.""  Twice called and thrice"
4641,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Antonius lingered still: but Caesar thought
4642,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To reap in full the favour of the gods,"
4643,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not sit supine; and knowing danger yields
4644,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To whom heaven favours, he upon the waves"
4645,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Feared by Antonius' fleets, in shallow boat"
4646,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Embarked, and daring sought the further shore."
4647,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4648,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Now gentle night had brought repose from arms;
4649,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And sleep, blest guardian of the poor man's couch,"
4650,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Restored the weary; and the camp was still.
4651,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The hour was come that called the second watch
4652,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When mighty Caesar, in the silence vast"
4653,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,With cautious tread advanced to such a deed (29)
4654,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"As slaves should dare not.  Fortune for his guide,"
4655,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Alone he passes on, and o'er the guard"
4656,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Stretched in repose he leaps, in secret wrath"
4657,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"At such a sleep.  Pacing the winding beach,"
4658,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Fast to a sea-worn rock he finds a boat
4659,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,On ocean's marge afloat.  Hard by on shore
4660,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Its master dwelt within his humble home.
4661,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"No solid front it reared, for sterile rush"
4662,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And marshy reed enwoven formed the walls,"
4663,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Propped by a shallop with its bending sides
4664,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Turned upwards.  Caesar's hand upon the door
4665,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Knocks twice and thrice until the fabric shook.
4666,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Amyclas from his couch of soft seaweed
4667,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Arising, calls: ""What shipwrecked sailor seeks"

4671,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Glows in the darkness, and throws wide the door."
4672,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Careless of war, he knew that civil strife"
4673,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Stoops not to cottages.  Oh!  happy life
4674,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That poverty affords!  great gift of heaven
4675,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Too little understood!  what mansion wall,"
4676,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"What temple of the gods, would feel no fear"
4677,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When Caesar called for entrance?  Then the chief:
4678,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Enlarge thine hopes and look for better things."
4679,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Do but my bidding, and on yonder shore"
4680,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Place me, and thou shalt cease from one poor boat"
4681,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To earn thy living; and in years to come
4682,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Look for a rich old age: and trust thy fates
4683,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To those high gods whose wont it is to bless
4684,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The poor with sudden plenty.""  So he spake"
4685,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"E'en at such time in accents of command,"
4686,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"For how could Caesar else?  Amyclas said,"
4687,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""'Twere dangerous to brave the deep to-night."
4688,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The sun descended not in ruddy clouds
4689,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Or peaceful rays to rest; part of his beams
4690,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Presaged a southern gale, the rest proclaimed"
4691,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"A northern tempest; and his middle orb,"
4692,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shorn of its strength, permitted human eyes"
4693,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To gaze upon his grandeur; and the moon
4694,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Rose not with silver horns upon the night
4695,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor pure in middle space; her slender points
4696,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not drawn aright, but blushing with the track"
4697,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of raging tempests, till her lurid light"
4698,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Was sadly veiled within the clouds.  Again
4699,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The forest sounds; the surf upon the shore;
4700,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The dolphin's mood, uncertain where to play;"
4701,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The sea-mew on the land; the heron used
4702,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To wade among the shallows, borne aloft"
4703,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And soaring on his wings -- all these alarm;
4704,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The raven, too, who plunged his head in spray,"
4705,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"As if to anticipate the coming rain,"
4706,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And trod the margin with unsteady gait.
4707,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But if the cause demands, behold me thine."
4708,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Either we reach the bidden shore, or else"
4709,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Storm and the deep forbid -- we can no more."""
4710,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4711,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thus said he loosed the boat and raised the sail.
4712,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,No sooner done than stars were seen to fall
4713,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"In flaming furrows from the sky: nay, more;"
4714,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The pole star trembled in its place on high:
4715,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Black horror marked the surging of the sea;
4716,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The main was boiling in long tracts of foam,"
4717,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Uncertain of the wind, yet seized with storm."
4718,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Then spake the captain of the trembling bark:
4719,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""See what remorseless ocean has in store!"
4720,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Whether from east or west the storm may come
4721,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Is still uncertain, for as yet confused"
4722,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The billows tumble.  Judged by clouds and sky
4723,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,A western tempest: by the murmuring deep
4724,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,A wild south-eastern gale shall sweep the sea.
4725,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor bark nor man shall reach Hesperia's shore
4726,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In this wild rage of waters.  To return
4727,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Back on our course forbidden by the gods,"
4728,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Is our one refuge, and with labouring boat"
4729,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To reach the shore ere yet the nearest land
4730,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Way be too distant."""
4731,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4732,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But great Caesar's trust
4733,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Was in himself, to make all dangers yield."
4734,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And thus he answered: ""Scorn the threatening sea,"
4735,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Spread out thy canvas to the raging wind;

4741,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Break through the middle storm and trust in me.
4742,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The burden of this fight fails not on us
4743,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But on the sky and ocean; and our bark
4744,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Shall swim the billows safe in him it bears.
4745,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor shall the wind rage long: the boat itself
4746,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Shall calm the waters.  Flee the nearest shore,"
4747,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Steer for the ocean with unswerving hand:

4749,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"No other port is given, believe thou hast"
4750,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Calabria's harbours.  And dost thou not know
4751,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The purpose of such havoc?  Fortune seeks

4753,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"A boon for Caesar.""  Then a hurricane"
4754,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Swooped on the boat and tore away the sheet:
4755,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The fluttering sail fell on the fragile mast:
4756,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And groaned the joints.  From all the universe
4757,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Commingled perils rush.  In Atlas' seas
4758,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"First Corus (30) lifts his head, and stirs the depths"

4760,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Whole seas and oceans; but the chilly north
4761,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Drove back the deep that doubted which was lord.
4762,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But Scythian Aquilo prevailed, whose blast"
4763,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Tossed up the main and showed as shallow pools
4764,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Each deep abyss; and yet was not the sea
4765,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Heaped on the crags, for Corus' billows met"
4766,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The waves of Boreas: such seas had clashed
4767,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Even were the winds withdrawn; Eurus enraged
4768,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Burst from the cave, and Notus black with rain,"
4769,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And all the winds from every part of heaven
4770,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Strove for their own; and thus the ocean stayed
4771,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Within his boundaries.  No petty seas
4772,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Rapt in the storm are whirled.  The Tuscan deep
4773,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Invades th' Aegean; in Ionian gulfs
4774,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Sounds wandering Hadria.  How long the crags
4775,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Which that day fell, the Ocean's blows had braved!"
4776,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,What lofty peaks did vanquished earth resign!
4777,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And yet on yonder coast such mighty waves
4778,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Took not their rise; from distant regions came
4779,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Those monster billows, driven on their course"
4780,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,By that great current which surrounds the world. (31)
4781,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thus did the King of Heaven, when length of years"
4782,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Wore out the forces of his thunder, call"
4783,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"His brother's trident to his help, what time"
4784,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The earth and sea one second kingdom formed
4785,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And ocean knew no limit but the sky.
4786,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Now, too, the sea had risen to the stars"
4787,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"In mighty mass, had not Olympus' chief"
4788,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Pressed down its waves with clouds: came not from heaven
4789,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"That night, as others; but the murky air"
4790,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Was dim with pallor of the realms below; (32)
4791,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The sky lay on the deep; within the clouds
4792,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The waves received the rain: the lightning flash
4793,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Clove through the parted air a path obscured
4794,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,By mist and darkness: and the heavenly vaults
4795,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Re-echoed to the tumult, and the frame"
4796,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That holds the sky was shaken.  Nature feared
4797,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Chaos returned, as though the elements"
4798,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Had burst their bonds, and night had come to mix"
4799,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Th' infernal shades with heaven.
4800,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4801,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In such turmoil
4802,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not to have perished was their only hope.
4803,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Far as from Leucas point the placid main
4804,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Spreads to the horizon, from the billow's crest"
4805,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,They viewed the dashing of th' infuriate sea;
4806,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thence sinking to the middle trough, their mast"
4807,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Scarce topped the watery height on either hand,"
4808,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Their sails in clouds, their keel upon the ground."
4809,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"For all the sea was piled into the waves,"
4810,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And drawn from depths between laid bare the sand.
4811,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The master of the boat forgot his art,"
4812,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For fear o'ercame; he knew not where to yield
4813,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Or where to meet the wave: but safety came
4814,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,From ocean's self at war: one billow forced
4815,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The vessel under, but a huger wave"
4816,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Repelled it upwards, and she rode the storm"
4817,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Through every blast triumphant.  Not the shore
4818,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of humble Sason (33), nor Thessalia's coast"
4819,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Indented, not Ambracia's scanty ports"
4820,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Dismay the sailors, but the giddy tops"
4821,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of high Ceraunia's cliffs.
4822,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4823,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But Caesar now,"
4824,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thinking the peril worthy of his fates:
4825,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Are such the labours of the gods?"" exclaimed,"
4826,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Bent on my downfall have they sought me thus,"
4827,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Here in this puny skiff in such a sea?
4828,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,If to the deep the glory of my fall
4829,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Is due, and not to war, intrepid still"
4830,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Whatever death they send shall strike me down.
4831,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Let fate cut short the deeds that I would do
4832,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And hasten on the end: the past is mine.
4833,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The northern nations fell beneath my sword;
4834,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,My dreaded name compels the foe to flee.
4835,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Pompeius yields me place; the people's voice
4836,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Gave at my order what the wars denied.
4837,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And all the titles which denote the powers
4838,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Known to the Roman state my name shall bear.
4839,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Let none know this but thou who hear'st my prayers,"
4840,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Fortune, that Caesar summoned to the shades,"
4841,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Dictator, Consul, full of honours, died"
4842,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Ere his last prize was won.  I ask no pomp
4843,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of pyre or funeral; let my body lie
4844,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Mangled beneath the waves: I leave a name
4845,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That men shall dread in ages yet to come
4846,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And all the earth shall honour.""  Thus he spake,"
4847,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When lo!  a tenth gigantic billow raised
4848,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The feeble keel, and where between the rocks"
4849,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"A cleft gave safety, placed it on the shore."
4850,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Thus in a moment fortune, kingdoms, lands,"
4851,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Once more were Caesar's.
4852,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4853,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But on his return
4854,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When daylight came, he entered not the camp"
4855,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Silent as when he parted; for his friends
4856,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Soon pressed around him, and with weeping eyes"
4857,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In accents welcome to his ears began:
4858,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Whither in reckless daring hast thou gone,"
4859,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Unpitying Caesar?  Were these humble lives
4860,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Left here unguarded while thy limbs were given,"
4861,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Unsought for, to be scattered by the storm?"
4862,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When on thy breath so many nations hang
4863,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"For life and safety, and so great a world"
4864,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Calls thee its master, to have courted death"
4865,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Proves want of heart.  Was none of all thy friends
4866,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Deserving held to join his fate with thine?
4867,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When thou wast tossed upon the raging deep
4868,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,We lay in slumber!  Shame upon such sleep!
4869,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And why thyself didst seek Italia's shores?
4870,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,'Twere cruel (such thy thought) to speak the word
4871,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That bade another dare the furious sea.
4872,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"All men must bear what chance or fate may bring,"
4873,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The sudden peril and the stroke of death;
4874,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But shall the ruler of the world attempt
4875,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The raging ocean?  With incessant prayers
4876,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Why weary heaven?  is it indeed enough
4877,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To crown the war, that Fortune and the deep"
4878,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Have cast thee on our shores?  And would'st thou use
4879,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The grace of favouring deities, to gain"
4880,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Not lordship, not the empire of the world,"
4881,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But lucky shipwreck!""  Night dispersed, and soon"
4882,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The sun beamed on them, and the wearied deep,"
4883,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The winds permitting, lulled its waves to rest."
4884,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And when Antonius saw a breeze arise
4885,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Fresh from a cloudless heaven, to break the sea,"
4886,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"He loosed his ships which, by the pilots' hands"
4887,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And by the wind in equal order held,"
4888,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Swept as a marching host across the main.
4889,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But night unfriendly from the seamen snatched
4890,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"All governance of sail, parting the ships"
4891,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In divers paths asunder.  Like as cranes
4892,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Deserting frozen Strymon for the streams
4893,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Of Nile, when winter falls, in casual lines"
4894,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of wedge-like figures (34) first ascend the sky;
4895,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,But when in loftier heaven the southern breeze
4896,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Strikes on their pinions tense, in loose array"
4897,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Dispersed at large, in flight irregular,"
4898,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,They wing their journey onwards.  Stronger winds
4899,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With day returning blew the navy on,"
4900,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Past Lissus' shelter which they vainly sought,"
4901,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Till bare to northern blasts, Nymphaeum's port,"
4902,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"But safe in southern, gave the fleet repose,"
4903,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,For favouring winds came on.
4904,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4905,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,When Magnus knew
4906,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,That Caesar's troops were gathered in their strength
4907,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And that the war for quick decision called
4908,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Before his camp, Cornelia he resolved"
4909,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To send to Lesbos' shore, from rage of fight"
4910,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Safe and apart: so lifting from his soul
4911,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The weight that burdened it.  Thus, lawful Love."
4912,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thus art thou tyrant o'er the mightiest mind!
4913,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,His spouse was the one cause why Magnus stayed
4914,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Nor met his fortunes, though he staked the world"
4915,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And all the destinies of Rome.  The word
4916,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"He speaks not though resolved; so sweet it seemed,"
4917,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When on the future pondering, to gain"
4918,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"A pause from Fate!  But at the close of night,"
4919,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When drowsy sleep had fled, Cornelia sought"
4920,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To soothe the anxious bosom of her lord
4921,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And win his kisses.  Then amazed she saw
4922,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"His cheek was tearful, and with boding soul"
4923,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"She shrank instinctive from the hidden wound,"
4924,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor dared to rouse him weeping.  But he spake:
4925,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Dearer to me than life itself, when life"
4926,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Is happy (not at moments such as these);
4927,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The day of sorrow comes, too long delayed,"
4928,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor long enough!  With Caesar at our gates
4929,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"With all his forces, a secure retreat"
4930,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Shall Lesbos give thee.  Try me not with prayers.
4931,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,This fatal boon I have denied myself.
4932,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thou wilt not long be absent from thy lord.
4933,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Disasters hasten, and things highest fall"
4934,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,With speediest ruin.  'Tis enough for thee
4935,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To hear of Magnus' peril; and thy love (35)
4936,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Deceives thee with the thought that thou canst gaze
4937,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Unmoved on civil strife.  It shames my soul
4938,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"On the eve of war to slumber at thy side,"
4939,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And rise from thy dear breast when trumpets call
4940,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,A woeful world to misery and arms.
4941,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,I fear in civil war to feel no loss
4942,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To Magnus.  Meantime safer than a king
4943,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Lie hid, nor let the fortune of thy lord"
4944,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Whelm thee with all its weight.  If unkind heaven
4945,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Our armies rout, still let my choicest part"
4946,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Survive in thee; if fated is my flight,"
4947,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Still leave me that whereto I fain would flee."""
4948,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
4949,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Hardly at first her senses grasped the words
4950,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In their full misery; then her mind amazed
4951,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Could scarce find utterance for the grief that pressed.
4952,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"""Nought, Magnus, now is left wherewith to upbraid"
4953,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The gods and fates of marriage; 'tis not death
4954,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"That parts our love, nor yet the funeral pyre,"
4955,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor that dread torch which marks the end of all.
4956,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,I share the ignoble lot of vulgar lives:
4957,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"My spouse rejects me.  Yes, the foe is come!"
4958,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Break we our bonds and Julia's sire appease! --
4959,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Is this thy consort, Magnus, this thy faith"
4960,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,In her fond loving heart?  Can danger fright
4961,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Her and not thee?  Long since our mutual fates
4962,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Hang by one chain; and dost thou bid me now
4963,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The thunder-bolts of ruin to withstand
4964,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Without thee?  Is it well that I should die
4965,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Even while you pray for fortune?  And suppose
4966,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,I flee from evil and with death self-sought
4967,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Follow thy footsteps to the realms below --
4968,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Am I to live till to that distant isle
4969,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Some tardy rumour of thy fall may come?
4970,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Add that thou fain by use would'st give me strength
4971,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To bear such sorrow and my doom.  Forgive
4972,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Thy wife confessing that she fears the power.
4973,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And if my prayers shall bring the victory,"
4974,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,The joyful tale shall come to me the last
4975,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"In that lone isle of rocks.  When all are glad,"
4976,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"My heart shall throb with anguish, and the sail"
4977,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Which brings the message I shall see with fear,"
4978,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not safe e'en then: for Caesar in his flight
4979,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Might seize me there, abandoned and alone"
4980,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"To be his hostage.  If thou place me there,"
4981,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The spouse of Magnus, shall not all the world"
4982,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Well know the secret Mitylene holds?
4983,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"This my last prayer: if all is lost but flight,"
4984,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And thou shalt seek the ocean, to my shores"
4985,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Turn not thy keel, ill-fated one: for there,"
4986,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"There will they seek thee.""  Thus she spoke distraught,"
4987,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Leaped from the couch and rushed upon her fate;
4988,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,No stop nor stay: she clung not to his neck
4989,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Nor threw her arms about him; both forego
4990,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"The last caress, the last fond pledge of love,"
4991,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And grief rushed in unchecked upon their souls;
4992,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Still gazing as they part no final words
4993,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Could either utter, and the sweet Farewell"
4994,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Remained unspoken.  This the saddest day
4995,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Of all their lives: for other woes that came
4996,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,More gently struck on hearts inured to grief.
4997,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Borne to the shore with failing limbs she fell
4998,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"And grasped the sands, embracing, till at last"
4999,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Her maidens placed her senseless in the ship.
5000,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,
5001,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Not in such grief she left her country's shores
5002,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"When Caesar's host drew near; for now she leaves,"
5003,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Though faithful to her lord, his side in flight"
5004,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,And flees her spouse.  All that next night she waked;
5005,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Then first what means a widowed couch she knew,"
5006,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Its cold, its solitude.  When slumber found"
5007,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Her eyelids, and forgetfulness her soul,"
5008,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved,"
5009,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"She grasps but air.  Though tossed by restless love,"
5010,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,She leaves a place beside her as for him
5011,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Returning.  Yet she feared Pompeius lost
5012,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,To her for ever.  But the gods ordained
5013,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,"Worse than her fears, and in the hour of woe"
5014,THE ORACLE. THE MUTINY. THE STORM,Gave her to look upon his face again.

5126,THESSALIA,THESSALIA
5127,THESSALIA,
5128,THESSALIA,
5129,THESSALIA,Now that the chiefs with minds intent on fight
5130,THESSALIA,Had drawn their armies near upon the hills
5131,THESSALIA,"And all the gods beheld their chosen pair,"
5132,THESSALIA,"Caesar, the Grecian towns despising, scorned"
5133,THESSALIA,To reap the glory of successful war
5134,THESSALIA,Save at his kinsman's cost.  In all his prayers
5135,THESSALIA,"He seeks that moment, fatal to the world,"
5136,THESSALIA,"When shall be cast the die, to win or lose,"
5137,THESSALIA,And all his fortune hang upon the throw.
5138,THESSALIA,"Thrice he drew out his troops, his eagles thrice,"
5139,THESSALIA,Demanding battle; thus to increase the woe
5140,THESSALIA,"Of Latium, prompt as ever: but his foes,"
5141,THESSALIA,"Proof against every art, refused to leave"
5142,THESSALIA,The rampart of their camp.  Then marching swift
5143,THESSALIA,By hidden path between the wooded fields
5144,THESSALIA,"He seeks, and hopes to seize, Dyrrhachium's (1) fort;"
5145,THESSALIA,"But Magnus, speeding by the ocean marge,"
5146,THESSALIA,"First camped on Petra's slopes, a rocky hill"
5147,THESSALIA,Thus by the natives named.  From thence he keeps
5148,THESSALIA,Watch o'er the fortress of Corinthian birth
5149,THESSALIA,Which by its towers alone without a guard
5150,THESSALIA,Was safe against a siege.  No hand of man
5151,THESSALIA,"In ancient days built up her lofty wall,"
5152,THESSALIA,No hammer rang upon her massive stones:
5153,THESSALIA,"Not all the works of war, nor Time himself"
5154,THESSALIA,Shall undermine her.  Nature's hand has raised
5155,THESSALIA,Her adamantine rocks and hedged her in
5156,THESSALIA,With bulwarks girded by the foamy main:
5157,THESSALIA,And but for one short bridge of narrow earth
5158,THESSALIA,"Dyrrhachium were an island.  Steep and fierce,"
5159,THESSALIA,"Dreaded of sailors, are the cliffs that bear"
5160,THESSALIA,"Her walls; and tempests, howling from the west,"
5161,THESSALIA,Toss up the raging main upon the roofs;
5162,THESSALIA,And homes and temples tremble at the shock.
5163,THESSALIA,
5164,THESSALIA,Thirsting for battle and with hopes inflamed
5165,THESSALIA,"Here Caesar hastes, with distant rampart lines"
5166,THESSALIA,"Seeking unseen to coop his foe within,"
5167,THESSALIA,Though spread in spacious camp upon the hills.
5168,THESSALIA,With eagle eye he measures out the land
5169,THESSALIA,"Meet to be compassed, nor content with turf"
5170,THESSALIA,"Fit for a hasty mound, he bids his troops"
5171,THESSALIA,Tear from the quarries many a giant rock:
5172,THESSALIA,"And spoils the dwellings of the Greeks, and drags"
5173,THESSALIA,Their walls asunder for his own.  Thus rose
5174,THESSALIA,A mighty barrier which no ram could burst
5175,THESSALIA,Nor any ponderous machine of war.
5176,THESSALIA,"Mountains are cleft, and level through the hills"
5177,THESSALIA,"The work of Caesar strides: wide yawns the moat,"
5178,THESSALIA,"Forts show their towers rising on the heights,"
5179,THESSALIA,And in vast circle forests are enclosed
5180,THESSALIA,"And groves and spacious lands, and beasts of prey,"
5181,THESSALIA,As in a line of toils.  Pompeius lacked
5182,THESSALIA,Nor field nor forage in th' encircled span
5183,THESSALIA,"Nor room to move his camp; nay, rivers rose"
5184,THESSALIA,"Within, and ran their course and reached the sea;"
5185,THESSALIA,"And Caesar wearied ere he saw the whole,"
5186,THESSALIA,And daylight failed him.  Let the ancient tale
5187,THESSALIA,Attribute to the labours of the gods
5188,THESSALIA,The walls of Ilium: let the fragile bricks
5189,THESSALIA,"Which compass in great Babylon, amaze"
5190,THESSALIA,The fleeting Parthian.  Here a larger space
5191,THESSALIA,Than those great cities which Orontes swift
5192,THESSALIA,"And Tigris' stream enclose, or that which boasts"
5193,THESSALIA,"In Eastern climes, the lordly palaces"
5194,THESSALIA,"Fit for Assyria's kings, is closed by walls"
5195,THESSALIA,Amid the haste and tumult of a war
5196,THESSALIA,Forced to completion.  Yet this labour huge
5197,THESSALIA,Was spent in vain.  So many hands had joined
5198,THESSALIA,"Or Sestos with Abydos, or had tamed"
5199,THESSALIA,"With mighty mole the Hellespontine wave,"
5200,THESSALIA,Or Corinth from the realm of Pelops' king
5201,THESSALIA,"Had rent asunder, or had spared each ship"
5202,THESSALIA,"Her voyage round the long Malean cape,"
5203,THESSALIA,"Or had done anything most hard, to change"
5204,THESSALIA,The world's created surface.  Here the war
5205,THESSALIA,Was prisoned: blood predestinate to flow
5206,THESSALIA,In all the parts of earth; the host foredoomed
5207,THESSALIA,To fall in Libya or in Thessaly
5208,THESSALIA,Was here: in such small amphitheatre
5209,THESSALIA,The tide of civil passion rose and fell.
5210,THESSALIA,
5211,THESSALIA,At first Pompeius knew not: so the hind
5212,THESSALIA,Who peaceful tills the mid-Sicilian fields
5213,THESSALIA,Hears not Pelorous (2) sounding to the storm;
5214,THESSALIA,"So billows thunder on Rutupian shores (3),"
5215,THESSALIA,Unheard by distant Caledonia's tribes.
5216,THESSALIA,But when he saw the mighty barrier stretch
5217,THESSALIA,"O'er hill and valley, and enclose the land,"
5218,THESSALIA,He bade his columns leave their rocky hold
5219,THESSALIA,And seize on posts of vantage in the plain;
5220,THESSALIA,Thus forcing Caesar to extend his troops
5221,THESSALIA,On wider lines; and holding for his own
5222,THESSALIA,Such space encompassed as divides from Rome
5223,THESSALIA,"Aricia, (4) sacred to that goddess chaste"
5224,THESSALIA,Of old Mycenae; or as Tiber holds
5225,THESSALIA,"From Rome's high ramparts to the Tuscan sea,"
5226,THESSALIA,Unless he deviate.  No bugle call
5227,THESSALIA,"Commands an onset, and the darts that fly"
5228,THESSALIA,Fly though forbidden; but the arm that flings
5229,THESSALIA,"For proof the lance, at random, here and there"
5230,THESSALIA,Deals impious slaughter.  Weighty care compelled
5231,THESSALIA,Each leader to withhold his troops from fight;
5232,THESSALIA,For there the weary earth of produce failed
5233,THESSALIA,"Pressed by Pompeius' steeds, whose horny hoofs"
5234,THESSALIA,Rang in their gallop on the grassy fields
5235,THESSALIA,And killed the succulence.  They strengthless lay
5236,THESSALIA,"Upon the mown expanse, nor pile of straw,"
5237,THESSALIA,"Brought from full barns in place of living grass,"
5238,THESSALIA,"Relieved their craving; shook their panting flanks,"
5239,THESSALIA,And as they wheeled Death struck his victim down.
5240,THESSALIA,Then foul contagion filled the murky air
5241,THESSALIA,Whose poisonous weight pressed on them in a cloud
5242,THESSALIA,Pestiferous; as in Nesis' isle (5) the breath
5243,THESSALIA,Of Styx rolls upwards from the mist-clad rocks;
5244,THESSALIA,Or that fell vapour which the caves exhale
5245,THESSALIA,From Typhon (6) raging in the depths below.
5246,THESSALIA,"Then died the soldiers, for the streams they drank"
5247,THESSALIA,Held yet more poison than the air: the skin
5248,THESSALIA,"Was dark and rigid, and the fiery plague"
5249,THESSALIA,"Made hard their vitals, and with pitiless tooth"
5250,THESSALIA,"Gnawed at their wasted features, while their eyes"
5251,THESSALIA,"Started from out their sockets, and the head"
5252,THESSALIA,Drooped for sheer weariness.  So the disease
5253,THESSALIA,"Grew swifter in its strides till scarce was room,"
5254,THESSALIA,"'Twixt life and death, for sickness, and the pest"
5255,THESSALIA,"Slew as it struck its victim, and the dead"
5256,THESSALIA,Thrust from the tents (such all their burial) lay
5257,THESSALIA,Blent with the living.  Yet their camp was pitched
5258,THESSALIA,Hard by the breezy sea by which might come
5259,THESSALIA,"All nations' harvests, and the northern wind"
5260,THESSALIA,Not seldom rolled the murky air away.
5261,THESSALIA,"Their foe, not vexed with pestilential air"
5262,THESSALIA,"Nor stagnant waters, ample range enjoyed"
5263,THESSALIA,Upon the spacious uplands: yet as though
5264,THESSALIA,"In leaguer, famine seized them for its prey."
5265,THESSALIA,Scarce were the crops half grown when Caesar saw
5266,THESSALIA,"How prone they seized upon the food of beasts,"
5267,THESSALIA,"And stripped of leaves the bushes and the groves,"
5268,THESSALIA,And dragged from roots unknown the doubtful herb.
5269,THESSALIA,"Thus ate they, starving, all that teeth may bite"
5270,THESSALIA,"Or fire might soften, or might pass their throats"
5271,THESSALIA,"Dry, parched, abraded; food unknown before"
5272,THESSALIA,Nor placed on tables: while the leaguered foe
5273,THESSALIA,Was blessed with plenty.
5274,THESSALIA,
5275,THESSALIA,When Pompeius first
5276,THESSALIA,"Was pleased to break his bonds and be at large,"
5277,THESSALIA,No sudden dash he makes on sleeping foe
5278,THESSALIA,Unarmed in shade of night; his mighty soul
5279,THESSALIA,"Scorns such a path to victory.  'Twas his aim,"
5280,THESSALIA,"To lay the turrets low; to mark his track,"
5281,THESSALIA,By ruin spread afar; and with the sword
5282,THESSALIA,To hew a path between his slaughtered foes.
5283,THESSALIA,Minucius' (7) turret was the chosen spot
5284,THESSALIA,Where groves of trees and thickets gave approach
5285,THESSALIA,"Safe, unbetrayed by dust."
5286,THESSALIA,
5287,THESSALIA,Up from the fields
5288,THESSALIA,Flashed all at once his eagles into sight
5289,THESSALIA,And all his trumpets blared.  But ere the sword
5290,THESSALIA,"Could win the battle, on the hostile ranks"
5291,THESSALIA,Dread panic fell; prone as in death they lay
5292,THESSALIA,Where else upright they should withstand the foe;
5293,THESSALIA,"Nor more availed their valour, and in vain"
5294,THESSALIA,"The cloud of weapons flew, with none to slay."
5295,THESSALIA,Then blazing torches rolling pitchy flame
5296,THESSALIA,"Are hurled, and shaken nod the lofty towers"
5297,THESSALIA,"And threaten ruin, and the bastions groan"
5298,THESSALIA,"Struck by the frequent engine, and the troops"
5299,THESSALIA,Of Magnus by triumphant eagles led
5300,THESSALIA,"Stride o'er the rampart, in their front the world."
5301,THESSALIA,
5302,THESSALIA,Yet now that passage which not Caesar's self
5303,THESSALIA,Nor thousand valiant squadrons had availed
5304,THESSALIA,"To rescue from their grasp, one man in arms"
5305,THESSALIA,Steadfast till death refused them; Scaeva named
5306,THESSALIA,This hero soldier: long he served in fight
5307,THESSALIA,Waged 'gainst the savage on the banks of Rhone;
5308,THESSALIA,"And now centurion made, through deeds of blood,"
5309,THESSALIA,He bore the staff before the marshalled line.
5310,THESSALIA,"Prone to all wickedness, he little recked"
5311,THESSALIA,How valourous deeds in civil war may be
5312,THESSALIA,Greatest of crimes; and when he saw how turned
5313,THESSALIA,His comrades from the war and sought in flight
5314,THESSALIA,"A refuge, (8) ""Whence,"" he cried, ""this impious fear"
5315,THESSALIA,Unknown to Caesar's armies?  Do ye turn
5316,THESSALIA,"Your backs on death, and are ye not ashamed"
5317,THESSALIA,Not to be found where slaughtered heroes lie?
5318,THESSALIA,Is loyalty too weak?  Yet love of fight
5319,THESSALIA,Might bid you stand.  We are the chosen few
5320,THESSALIA,Through whom the foe would break.  Unbought by blood
5321,THESSALIA,"This day shall not be theirs.  'Neath Caesar's eye,"
5322,THESSALIA,"True, death would be more happy; but this boon"
5323,THESSALIA,Fortune denies: at least my fall shall be
5324,THESSALIA,Praised by Pompeius.  Break ye with your breasts
5325,THESSALIA,Their weapons; blunt the edges of their swords
5326,THESSALIA,With throats unyielding.  In the distant lines
5327,THESSALIA,"The dust is seen already, and the sound"
5328,THESSALIA,Of tumult and of ruin finds the ear
5329,THESSALIA,Of Caesar: strike; the victory is ours:
5330,THESSALIA,For he shall come who while his soldiers die
5331,THESSALIA,"Shall make the fortress his.""  His voice called forth"
5332,THESSALIA,The courage that the trumpets failed to rouse
5333,THESSALIA,When first they rang: his comrades mustering come
5334,THESSALIA,"To watch his deeds; and, wondering at the man,"
5335,THESSALIA,"To test if valour thus by foes oppressed,"
5336,THESSALIA,"In narrow space, could hope for aught but death."
5337,THESSALIA,But Scaeva standing on the tottering bank
5338,THESSALIA,Heaves from the brimming turret on the foe
5339,THESSALIA,The corpses of the fallen; the ruined mass
5340,THESSALIA,"Furnishing weapons to his hands; with beams,"
5341,THESSALIA,"And ponderous stones, nay, with his body threats"
5342,THESSALIA,His enemies; with poles and stakes he thrusts
5343,THESSALIA,The breasts advancing; when they grasp the wall
5344,THESSALIA,He lops the arm: rocks crush the foeman's skull
5345,THESSALIA,And rive the scalp asunder: fiery bolts
5346,THESSALIA,"Dashed at another set his hair aflame,"
5347,THESSALIA,Till rolls the greedy blaze about his eyes
5348,THESSALIA,With hideous crackle.  As the pile of slain
5349,THESSALIA,"Rose to the summit of the wall he sprang,"
5350,THESSALIA,"Swift as across the nets a hunted pard,"
5351,THESSALIA,"Above the swords upraised, till in mid throng"
5352,THESSALIA,"Of foes he stood, hemmed in by densest ranks"
5353,THESSALIA,"And ramparted by war; in front and rear,"
5354,THESSALIA,"Where'er he struck, the victor.  Now his sword"
5355,THESSALIA,"Blunted with gore congealed no more could wound,"
5356,THESSALIA,But brake the stricken limb; while every hand
5357,THESSALIA,Flung every quivering dart at him alone;
5358,THESSALIA,"Nor missed their aim, for rang against his shield"
5359,THESSALIA,"Dart after dart unerring, and his helm"
5360,THESSALIA,In broken fragments pressed upon his brow;
5361,THESSALIA,His vital parts were safeguarded by spears
5362,THESSALIA,That bristled in his body.  Fortune saw
5363,THESSALIA,"Thus waged a novel combat, for there warred"
5364,THESSALIA,"Against one man an army.  Why with darts,"
5365,THESSALIA,"Madmen, assail him and with slender shafts,"
5366,THESSALIA,'Gainst which his life is proof?  Or ponderous stones
5367,THESSALIA,"This warrior chief shall overwhelm, or bolts"
5368,THESSALIA,Flung by the twisted thongs of mighty slings.
5369,THESSALIA,Let steelshod ram or catapult remove
5370,THESSALIA,This champion of the gate.  No fragile wall
5371,THESSALIA,"Stands here for Caesar, blocking with its bulk"
5372,THESSALIA,Pompeius' way to freedom.  Now he trusts
5373,THESSALIA,"His shield no more, lest his sinister hand,"
5374,THESSALIA,"Idle, give life by shame; and on his breast"
5375,THESSALIA,"Bearing a forest of spears, though spent with toil"
5376,THESSALIA,"And worn with onset, falls upon his foe"
5377,THESSALIA,And braves alone the wounds of all the war.
5378,THESSALIA,"Thus may an elephant in Afric wastes,"
5379,THESSALIA,"Oppressed by frequent darts, break those that fall"
5380,THESSALIA,"Rebounding from his horny hide, and shake"
5381,THESSALIA,"Those that find lodgment, while his life within"
5382,THESSALIA,"Lies safe, protected, nor doth spear avail"
5383,THESSALIA,To reach the fount of blood.  Unnumbered wounds
5384,THESSALIA,"By arrow dealt, or lance, thus fail to slay"
5385,THESSALIA,This single warrior.  But lo!  from far
5386,THESSALIA,"A Cretan archer's shaft, more sure of aim"
5387,THESSALIA,"Than vows could hope for, strikes on Scaeva's brow"
5388,THESSALIA,To light within his eye: the hero tugs
5389,THESSALIA,"Intrepid, bursts the nerves, and tears the shaft"
5390,THESSALIA,"Forth with the eyeball, and with dauntless heel"
5391,THESSALIA,Treads them to dust.  Not otherwise a bear
5392,THESSALIA,"Pannonian, fiercer for the wound received,"
5393,THESSALIA,"Maddened by dart from Libyan thong propelled,"
5394,THESSALIA,"Turns circling on her wound, and still pursues"
5395,THESSALIA,The weapon fleeing as she whirls around.
5396,THESSALIA,"Thus, in his rage destroyed, his shapeless face"
5397,THESSALIA,Stood foul with crimson flow.  The victors' shout
5398,THESSALIA,Glad to the sky arose; no greater joy
5399,THESSALIA,A little blood could give them had they seen
5400,THESSALIA,That Caesar's self was wounded.  Down he pressed
5401,THESSALIA,"Deep in his soul the anguish, and, with mien,"
5402,THESSALIA,"No longer bent on fight, submissive cried,"
5403,THESSALIA,"""Spare me, ye citizens; remove the war"
5404,THESSALIA,Far hence: no weapons now can haste my death;
5405,THESSALIA,"Draw from my breast the darts, but add no more."
5406,THESSALIA,Yet raise me up to place me in the camp
5407,THESSALIA,"Of Magnus, living: this your gift to him;"
5408,THESSALIA,"No brave man's death my title to renown,"
5409,THESSALIA,"But Caesar's flag deserted.""  So he spake."
5410,THESSALIA,"Unhappy Aulus thought his words were true,"
5411,THESSALIA,Nor saw within his hand the pointed sword;
5412,THESSALIA,And leaping forth in haste to make his own
5413,THESSALIA,"The prisoner and his arms, in middle throat"
5414,THESSALIA,Received the lightning blade.  By this one death
5415,THESSALIA,"Rose Scaeva's valour again; and thus he cried,"
5416,THESSALIA,Such be the punishment of all who thought
5417,THESSALIA,Great Scaeva vanquished; if Pompeius seeks
5418,THESSALIA,"Peace from this reeking sword, low let him lay"
5419,THESSALIA,At Caesar's feet his standards.  Me do ye think
5420,THESSALIA,"Such as yourselves, and slow to meet the fates?"
5421,THESSALIA,Your love for Magnus and the Senate's cause
5422,THESSALIA,"Is less than mine for death.""  These were his words;"
5423,THESSALIA,And dust in columns proved that Caesar came.
5424,THESSALIA,Thus was Pompeius' glory spared the stain
5425,THESSALIA,"Of flight compelled by Scaeva.  He, when ceased"
5426,THESSALIA,"The battle, fell, no more by rage of fight,"
5427,THESSALIA,"Or sight of blood out-pouring from his wounds,"
5428,THESSALIA,Roused to the combat.  Fainting there he lay
5429,THESSALIA,"Upon the shoulders of his comrades borne,"
5430,THESSALIA,Who him adoring (as though deity
5431,THESSALIA,"Dwelt in his bosom) for his matchless deeds,"
5432,THESSALIA,Plucked forth the gory shafts and took his arms
5433,THESSALIA,To deck the gods and shield the breast of Mars.
5434,THESSALIA,"Thrice happy thou with such a name achieved,"
5435,THESSALIA,"Had but the fierce Iberian from thy sword,"
5436,THESSALIA,"Or heavy shielded Teuton, or had fled"
5437,THESSALIA,The light Cantabrian: with no spoils shalt thou
5438,THESSALIA,"Adorn the Thunderer's temple, nor upraise"
5439,THESSALIA,The shout of triumph in the ways of Rome.
5440,THESSALIA,"For all thy prowess, all thy deeds of pride"
5441,THESSALIA,Do but prepare her lord.
5442,THESSALIA,
5443,THESSALIA,Nor on this hand
5444,THESSALIA,"Repulsed, Pompeius idly ceased from war,"
5445,THESSALIA,Content within his bars; but as the sea
5446,THESSALIA,"Tireless, which tempests force upon the crag"
5447,THESSALIA,"That breaks it, or which gnaws a mountain side"
5448,THESSALIA,Some day to fall in ruin on itself;
5449,THESSALIA,"He sought the turrets nearest to the main,"
5450,THESSALIA,On double onset bent; nor closely kept
5451,THESSALIA,"His troops in hand, but on the spacious plain"
5452,THESSALIA,Spread forth his camp.  They joyful leave the tents
5453,THESSALIA,And wander at their will.  Thus Padus flows
5454,THESSALIA,"In brimming flood, and foaming at his bounds,"
5455,THESSALIA,Making whole districts quake; and should the bank
5456,THESSALIA,"Fail 'neath his swollen waters, all his stream"
5457,THESSALIA,Breaks forth in swirling eddies over fields
5458,THESSALIA,"Not his before; some lands are lost, the rest"
5459,THESSALIA,Gain from his bounty.
5460,THESSALIA,
5461,THESSALIA,Hardly from his tower
5462,THESSALIA,Had Caesar seen the fire or known the fight:
5463,THESSALIA,"And coming found the rampart overthrown,"
5464,THESSALIA,"The dust no longer stirred, the rains cold"
5465,THESSALIA,As from a battle done.  The peace that reigned
5466,THESSALIA,"There and on Magnus' side, as though men slept,"
5467,THESSALIA,"Their victory won, aroused his angry soul."
5468,THESSALIA,"Quick he prepares, so that he end their joy"
5469,THESSALIA,"Careless of slaughter or defeat, to rush"
5470,THESSALIA,With threatening columns on Torquatus' post.
5471,THESSALIA,"But swift as sailor, by his trembling mast"
5472,THESSALIA,"Warned of Circeian tempest, furls his sails,"
5473,THESSALIA,"So swift Torquatus saw, and prompt to wage"
5474,THESSALIA,"The war more closely, he withdrew his men"
5475,THESSALIA,Within a narrower wall.
5476,THESSALIA,
5477,THESSALIA,Now past the trench
5478,THESSALIA,"Were Caesar's companies, when from the hills"
5479,THESSALIA,Pompeius hurled his host upon their ranks
5480,THESSALIA,"Shut in, and hampered.  Not so much o'erwhelmed"
5481,THESSALIA,As Caesar's soldiers is the hind who dwells
5482,THESSALIA,"On Etna's slopes, when blows the southern wind,"
5483,THESSALIA,And all the mountain pours its cauldrons forth
5484,THESSALIA,Upon the vale; and huge Enceladus (9)
5485,THESSALIA,Writhing beneath his load spouts o'er the plains
5486,THESSALIA,A blazing torrent.
5487,THESSALIA,
5488,THESSALIA,"Blinded by the dust,"
5489,THESSALIA,"Encircled, vanquished, ere the fight, they fled"
5490,THESSALIA,"In cloud of terror on their rearward foe,"
5491,THESSALIA,So rushing on their fates.  Thus had the war
5492,THESSALIA,"Shed its last drop of blood and peace ensued,"
5493,THESSALIA,"But Magnus suffered not, and held his troops."
5494,THESSALIA,Back from the battle.
5495,THESSALIA,
5496,THESSALIA,"Thou, oh Rome, had'st been"
5497,THESSALIA,"Free, happy, mistress of thy laws and rights"
5498,THESSALIA,Were Sulla here.  Now shalt thou ever grieve
5499,THESSALIA,"That in his crowning crime, to have met in fight"
5500,THESSALIA,"A pious kinsman, Caesar's vantage lay."
5501,THESSALIA,Oh tragic destiny!  Nor Munda's fight
5502,THESSALIA,"Hispania had wept, nor Libya mourned"
5503,THESSALIA,"Encrimsoned Utica, nor Nilus' stream,"
5504,THESSALIA,"With blood unspeakable polluted, borne"
5505,THESSALIA,A nobler corse than her Egyptian kings:
5506,THESSALIA,"Nor Juba (10) lain unburied on the sands,"
5507,THESSALIA,Nor Scipio with his blood outpoured appeased
5508,THESSALIA,The ghosts of Carthage; nor the blameless life
5509,THESSALIA,Of Cato ended: and Pharsalia's name
5510,THESSALIA,Had then been blotted from the book of fate.
5511,THESSALIA,
5512,THESSALIA,But Caesar left the region where his arms
5513,THESSALIA,"Had found the deities averse, and marched"
5514,THESSALIA,His shattered columns to Thessalian lands.
5515,THESSALIA,Then to Pompeius came (whose mind was bent
5516,THESSALIA,To follow Caesar wheresoe'er he fled)
5517,THESSALIA,"His captains, striving to persuade their chief"
5518,THESSALIA,"To seek Ausonia, his native land,"
5519,THESSALIA,"Now freed from foes.  ""Ne'er will I pass,"" he said,"
5520,THESSALIA,"""My country's limit, nor revisit Rome"
5521,THESSALIA,"Like Caesar, at the head of banded hosts."
5522,THESSALIA,Hesperia when the war began was mine;
5523,THESSALIA,"Mine, had I chosen in our country's shrines, (11)"
5524,THESSALIA,"In midmost forum of her capital,"
5525,THESSALIA,To join the battle.  So that banished far
5526,THESSALIA,"Be war from Rome, I'll cross the torrid zone"
5527,THESSALIA,Or those for ever frozen Scythian shores.
5528,THESSALIA,What!  shall my victory rob thee of the peace
5529,THESSALIA,I gave thee by my flight?  Rather than thou
5530,THESSALIA,"Should'st feel the evils of this impious war,"
5531,THESSALIA,"Let Caesar deem thee his.""  Thus said, his course"
5532,THESSALIA,"He turned towards the rising of the sun,"
5533,THESSALIA,"And following devious paths, through forests wide,"
5534,THESSALIA,"Made for Emathia, the land by fate"
5535,THESSALIA,Foredoomed to see the issue.
5536,THESSALIA,
5537,THESSALIA,Thessalia on that side where Titan first
5538,THESSALIA,"Raises the wintry day, by Ossa's rocks"
5539,THESSALIA,Is prisoned in: but in th' advancing year
5540,THESSALIA,When higher in the vault his chariot rides
5541,THESSALIA,'Tis Pelion that meets the morning rays.
5542,THESSALIA,And when beside the Lion's flames he drives
5543,THESSALIA,"The middle course, Othrys with woody top"
5544,THESSALIA,Screens his chief ardour.  On the hither side
5545,THESSALIA,Pindus receives the breezes of the west
5546,THESSALIA,And as the evening falls brings darkness in.
5547,THESSALIA,"There too Olympus, at whose foot who dwells"
5548,THESSALIA,Nor fears the north nor sees the shining bear.
5549,THESSALIA,"Between these mountains hemmed, in ancient time"
5550,THESSALIA,"The fields were marsh, for Tempe's pass not yet"
5551,THESSALIA,"Was cleft, to give an exit to the streams"
5552,THESSALIA,That filled the plain: but when Alcides' hand
5553,THESSALIA,"Smote Ossa from Olympus at a blow, (12)"
5554,THESSALIA,And Nereus wondered at the sudden flood
5555,THESSALIA,"Of waters to the main, then on the shore"
5556,THESSALIA,(Would it had slept for ever 'neath the deep)
5557,THESSALIA,Seaborn Achilles' home Pharsalus rose;
5558,THESSALIA,And Phylace (13) whence sailed that ship of old
5559,THESSALIA,Whose keel first touched upon the beach of Troy;
5560,THESSALIA,And Dorion mournful for the Muses' ire
5561,THESSALIA,On Thamyris (14) vanquished: Trachis; Melibe
5562,THESSALIA,"Strong in the shafts (15) of Hercules, the price"
5563,THESSALIA,Of that most awful torch; Larissa's hold
5564,THESSALIA,"Potent of yore; and Argos, (16) famous erst,"
5565,THESSALIA,O'er which men pass the ploughshare: and the spot
5566,THESSALIA,"Fabled as Echionian Thebes, (17) where once"
5567,THESSALIA,Agave bore in exile to the pyre
5568,THESSALIA,(Grieving 'twas all she had) the head and neck
5569,THESSALIA,Of Pentheus massacred.  The lake set free
5570,THESSALIA,Flowed forth in many rivers: to the west
5571,THESSALIA,"Aeas, (18) a gentle stream; nor stronger flows"
5572,THESSALIA,The sire of Isis ravished from his arms;
5573,THESSALIA,"And Achelous, rival for the hand"
5574,THESSALIA,"Of Oeneus' daughter, rolls his earthy flood (19)"
5575,THESSALIA,To silt the shore beside the neighbouring isles.
5576,THESSALIA,Evenus (20) purpled by the Centaur's blood
5577,THESSALIA,Wanders through Calydon: in the Malian Gulf
5578,THESSALIA,"Thy rapids fall, Spercheius: pure the wave"
5579,THESSALIA,With which Amphrysos (21) irrigates the meads
5580,THESSALIA,Where once Apollo served: Anaurus (22) flows
5581,THESSALIA,Breathing no vapour forth; no humid air
5582,THESSALIA,"Ripples his face: and whatever stream,"
5583,THESSALIA,"Nameless itself, to Ocean gives its waves"
5584,THESSALIA,"Through thee, Peneus: (23) whirled in eddies foams"
5585,THESSALIA,Apidanus; Enipeus lingers on
5586,THESSALIA,Swift only when fresh streams his volume swell:
5587,THESSALIA,"And thus Asopus takes his ordered course,"
5588,THESSALIA,Phoenix and Melas; but Eurotas keeps
5589,THESSALIA,"His stream aloof from that with which he flows,"
5590,THESSALIA,"Peneus, gliding on his top as though"
5591,THESSALIA,"Upon the channel.  Fable says that, sprung"
5592,THESSALIA,"From darkest pools of Styx, with common floods"
5593,THESSALIA,"He scorns to mingle, mindful of his source,"
5594,THESSALIA,So that the gods above may fear him still.
5595,THESSALIA,
5596,THESSALIA,"Soon as were sped the rivers, Boebian ploughs"
5597,THESSALIA,Dark with its riches broke the virgin soil;
5598,THESSALIA,"Then came Lelegians to press the share,"
5599,THESSALIA,And Dolopes and sons of Oeolus
5600,THESSALIA,By whom the glebe was furrowed.  Steed-renowned
5601,THESSALIA,"Magnetians dwelt there, and the Minyan race"
5602,THESSALIA,Who smote the sounding billows with the oar.
5603,THESSALIA,There in the cavern from the pregnant cloud
5604,THESSALIA,"Ixion's sons found birth, the Centaur brood"
5605,THESSALIA,"Half beast, half human: Monychus who broke"
5606,THESSALIA,"The stubborn rocks of Pholoe, Rhoetus fierce"
5607,THESSALIA,Hurling from Oeta's top gigantic elms
5608,THESSALIA,Which northern storms could hardly overturn;
5609,THESSALIA,"Pholus, Alcides' host: Nessus who bore"
5610,THESSALIA,"The Queen across Evenus' (24) waves, to feel"
5611,THESSALIA,The deadly arrow for his shameful deed;
5612,THESSALIA,And aged Chiron (25) who with wintry star
5613,THESSALIA,Against the huger Scorpion draws his bow.
5614,THESSALIA,Here sparkled on the land the warrior seed; (26)
5615,THESSALIA,Here leaped the charger from Thessalian rocks (27)
5616,THESSALIA,"Struck by the trident of the Ocean King,"
5617,THESSALIA,"Omen of dreadful war; here first he learned,"
5618,THESSALIA,"Champing the bit and foaming at the curb,"
5619,THESSALIA,Yet to obey his lord.  From yonder shore
5620,THESSALIA,"The keel of pine first floated, (28) and bore men"
5621,THESSALIA,To dare the perilous chance of seas unknown:
5622,THESSALIA,And here Ionus ruler of the land
5623,THESSALIA,First from the furnace molten masses drew
5624,THESSALIA,Of iron and brass; here first the hammer fell
5625,THESSALIA,"To weld them, shapeless; here in glowing stream"
5626,THESSALIA,"Ran silver forth and gold, soon to receive"
5627,THESSALIA,The minting stamp.  'Twas thus that money came
5628,THESSALIA,"Whereby men count their riches, cause accursed"
5629,THESSALIA,Of warfare.  Hence came down that Python huge
5630,THESSALIA,On Cirrha: hence the laurel wreath which crowns
5631,THESSALIA,The Pythian victor: here Aloeus' sons
5632,THESSALIA,"Gigantic rose against the gods, what time"
5633,THESSALIA,"Pelion had almost touched the stars supreme,"
5634,THESSALIA,And Ossa's loftier peak amid the sky
5635,THESSALIA,"Opposing, barred the constellations' way."
5636,THESSALIA,
5637,THESSALIA,When in this fated land the chiefs had placed
5638,THESSALIA,"Their several camps, foreboding of the end"
5639,THESSALIA,"Now fast approaching, all men's thoughts were turned"
5640,THESSALIA,Upon the final issue of the war.
5641,THESSALIA,"And as the hour drew near, the coward minds"
5642,THESSALIA,Trembling beneath the shadow of the fate
5643,THESSALIA,"Now hanging o'er them, deemed disaster near:"
5644,THESSALIA,"While some took heart; yet doubted what might fall,"
5645,THESSALIA,In hope and fear alternate.  'Mid the throng
5646,THESSALIA,"Sextus, unworthy son of worthy sire"
5647,THESSALIA,"Who soon upon the waves that Scylla guards, (29)"
5648,THESSALIA,"Sicilian pirate, exile from his home,"
5649,THESSALIA,"Stained by his deeds of shame the fights he won,"
5650,THESSALIA,"Could bear delay no more; his feeble soul,"
5651,THESSALIA,"Sick of uncertain fate, by fear compelled,"
5652,THESSALIA,Forecast the future: yet consulted not
5653,THESSALIA,The shrine of Delos nor the Pythian caves;
5654,THESSALIA,Nor was he satisfied to learn the sound
5655,THESSALIA,"Of Jove's brass cauldron, 'mid Dodona's oaks,"
5656,THESSALIA,By her primaeval fruits the nurse of men:
5657,THESSALIA,"Nor sought he sages who by flight of birds,"
5658,THESSALIA,Or watching with Assyrian care the stars
5659,THESSALIA,"And fires of heaven, or by victims slain,"
5660,THESSALIA,May know the fates to come; nor any source
5661,THESSALIA,Lawful though secret.  For to him was known
5662,THESSALIA,That which excites the hate of gods above;
5663,THESSALIA,"Magicians' lore, the savage creed of Dis"
5664,THESSALIA,And all the shades; and sad with gloomy rites
5665,THESSALIA,Mysterious altars.  For his frenzied soul
5666,THESSALIA,Heaven knew too little.  And the spot itself
5667,THESSALIA,"Kindled his madness, for hard by there dwelt"
5668,THESSALIA,The brood of Haemon (30) whom no storied witch
5669,THESSALIA,Of fiction e'er transcended; all their art
5670,THESSALIA,In things most strange and most incredible;
5671,THESSALIA,There were Thessalian rocks with deadly herbs
5672,THESSALIA,"Thick planted, sensible to magic chants,"
5673,THESSALIA,"Funereal, secret: and the land was full"
5674,THESSALIA,Of violence to the gods: the Queenly guest (31)
5675,THESSALIA,From Colchis gathered here the fatal roots
5676,THESSALIA,That were not in her store: hence vain to heaven
5677,THESSALIA,"Rise impious incantations, all unheard;"
5678,THESSALIA,For deaf the ears divine: save for one voice
5679,THESSALIA,Which penetrates the furthest depths of airs
5680,THESSALIA,Compelling e'en th' unwilling deities
5681,THESSALIA,To hearken to its accents.  Not the care
5682,THESSALIA,Of the revolving sky or starry pole
5683,THESSALIA,Can call them from it ever.  Once the sound
5684,THESSALIA,Of those dread tones unspeakable has reached
5685,THESSALIA,"The constellations, then nor Babylon"
5686,THESSALIA,"Nor secret Memphis, though they open wide"
5687,THESSALIA,The shrines of ancient magic and entreat
5688,THESSALIA,"The gods, could draw them from the fires that smoke"
5689,THESSALIA,Upon the altars of far Thessaly.
5690,THESSALIA,To hearts of flint those incantations bring
5691,THESSALIA,"Love, strange, unnatural; the old man's breast"
5692,THESSALIA,Burns with illicit fire.  Nor lies the power
5693,THESSALIA,In harmful cup nor in the juicy pledge
5694,THESSALIA,Of love maternal from the forehead drawn; (32)
5695,THESSALIA,"Charmed forth by spells alone the mind decays,"
5696,THESSALIA,By poisonous drugs unharmed.  With woven threads
5697,THESSALIA,Crossed in mysterious fashion do they bind
5698,THESSALIA,Those whom no passion born of beauteous form
5699,THESSALIA,Or loving couch unites.  All things on earth
5700,THESSALIA,Change at their bidding; night usurps the day;
5701,THESSALIA,The heavens disobey their wonted laws;
5702,THESSALIA,At that dread hymn the Universe stands still;
5703,THESSALIA,And Jove while urging the revolving wheels
5704,THESSALIA,Wonders they move not.  Torrents are outpoured
5705,THESSALIA,Beneath a burning sun; and thunder roars
5706,THESSALIA,Uncaused by Jupiter.  From their flowing locks
5707,THESSALIA,Vapours immense shall issue at their call;
5708,THESSALIA,When falls the tempest seas shall rise and foam (33)
5709,THESSALIA,Moved by their spell; though powerless the breeze
5710,THESSALIA,To raise the billows.  Ships against the wind
5711,THESSALIA,With bellying sails move onward.  From the rock
5712,THESSALIA,Hangs motionless the torrent: rivers run
5713,THESSALIA,Uphill; the summer heat no longer swells
5714,THESSALIA,Nile in his course; Maeander's stream is straight;
5715,THESSALIA,Slow Rhone is quickened by the rush of Saone;
5716,THESSALIA,Hills dip their heads and topple to the plain;
5717,THESSALIA,Olympus sees his clouds drift overhead;
5718,THESSALIA,And sunless Scythia's sempiternal snows
5719,THESSALIA,Melt in mid-winter; the inflowing tides
5720,THESSALIA,"Driven onward by the moon, at that dread chant"
5721,THESSALIA,"Ebb from their course; earth's axes, else unmoved,"
5722,THESSALIA,"Have trembled, and the force centripetal"
5723,THESSALIA,"Has tottered, and the earth's compacted frame"
5724,THESSALIA,"Struck by their voice has gaped, (34) till through the void"
5725,THESSALIA,Men saw the moving sky.  All beasts most fierce
5726,THESSALIA,"And savage fear them, yet with deadly aid"
5727,THESSALIA,Furnish the witches' arts.  Tigers athirst
5728,THESSALIA,"For blood, and noble lions on them fawn"
5729,THESSALIA,With bland caresses: serpents at their word
5730,THESSALIA,"Uncoil their circles, and extended glide"
5731,THESSALIA,Along the surface of the frosty field;
5732,THESSALIA,The viper's severed body joins anew;
5733,THESSALIA,And dies the snake by human venom slain.
5734,THESSALIA,
5735,THESSALIA,"Whence comes this labour on the gods, compelled"
5736,THESSALIA,"To hearken to the magic chant and spells,"
5737,THESSALIA,Nor daring to despise them?  Doth some bond
5738,THESSALIA,"Control the deities?  Is their pleasure so,"
5739,THESSALIA,Or must they listen?  and have silent threats
5740,THESSALIA,"Prevailed, or piety unseen received"
5741,THESSALIA,So great a guerdon?  Against all the gods
5742,THESSALIA,"Is this their influence, or on one alone"
5743,THESSALIA,"Who to his will constrains the universe,"
5744,THESSALIA,Himself constrained?  Stars most in yonder clime
5745,THESSALIA,Shoot headlong from the zenith; and the moon
5746,THESSALIA,Gliding serene upon her nightly course
5747,THESSALIA,"Is shorn of lustre by their poisonous chant,"
5748,THESSALIA,"Dimmed by dark earthly fires, as though our orb"
5749,THESSALIA,Shadowed her brother's radiance and barred
5750,THESSALIA,The light bestowed by heaven; nor freshly shines
5751,THESSALIA,Until descending nearer to the earth
5752,THESSALIA,She sheds her baneful drops upon the mead.
5753,THESSALIA,
5754,THESSALIA,These sinful rites and these her sister's songs
5755,THESSALIA,"Abhorred Erichtho, fiercest of the race,"
5756,THESSALIA,"Spurned for their piety, and yet viler art"
5757,THESSALIA,Practised in novel form.  To her no home
5758,THESSALIA,Beneath a sheltering roof her direful head
5759,THESSALIA,Thus to lay down were crime: deserted tombs
5760,THESSALIA,"Her dwelling-place, from which, darling of hell,"
5761,THESSALIA,She dragged the dead.  Nor life nor gods forbad
5762,THESSALIA,But that she knew the secret homes of Styx
5763,THESSALIA,And learned to hear the whispered voice of ghosts
5764,THESSALIA,At dread mysterious meetings. (35)  Never sun
5765,THESSALIA,Shed his pure light upon that haggard cheek
5766,THESSALIA,"Pale with the pallor of the shades, nor looked"
5767,THESSALIA,Upon those locks unkempt that crowned her brow.
5768,THESSALIA,In starless nights of tempest crept the hag
5769,THESSALIA,Out from her tomb to seize the levin bolt;
5770,THESSALIA,Treading the harvest with accursed foot
5771,THESSALIA,"She burned the fruitful growth, and with her breath"
5772,THESSALIA,Poisoned the air else pure.  No prayer she breathed
5773,THESSALIA,Nor supplication to the gods for help
5774,THESSALIA,Nor knew the pulse of entrails as do men
5775,THESSALIA,Who worship.  Funeral pyres she loves to light
5776,THESSALIA,And snatch the incense from the flaming tomb.
5777,THESSALIA,The gods at her first utterance grant her prayer
5778,THESSALIA,"For things unlawful, lest they hear again"
5779,THESSALIA,Its fearful accents: men whose limbs were quick
5780,THESSALIA,With vital power she thrust within the grave
5781,THESSALIA,Despite the fates who owed them years to come:
5782,THESSALIA,The funeral reversed brought from the tomb
5783,THESSALIA,Those who were dead no longer; and the pyre
5784,THESSALIA,Yields to her shameless clutch still smoking dust
5785,THESSALIA,"And bones enkindled, and the torch which held"
5786,THESSALIA,"Some grieving sire but now, with fragments mixed"
5787,THESSALIA,In sable smoke and ceremental cloths
5788,THESSALIA,Singed with the redolent fire that burned the dead.
5789,THESSALIA,But those who lie within a stony cell
5790,THESSALIA,"Untouched by fire, whose dried and mummied frames"
5791,THESSALIA,"No longer know corruption, limb by limb"
5792,THESSALIA,"Venting her rage she tears, the bloodless eyes"
5793,THESSALIA,"Drags from their cavities, and mauls the nail"
5794,THESSALIA,Upon the withered hand: she gnaws the noose
5795,THESSALIA,"By which some wretch has died, and from the tree"
5796,THESSALIA,"Drags down a pendent corpse, its members torn"
5797,THESSALIA,Asunder to the winds: forth from the palms
5798,THESSALIA,"Wrenches the iron, and from the unbending bond"
5799,THESSALIA,"Hangs by her teeth, and with her hands collects"
5800,THESSALIA,The slimy gore which drips upon the limbs.
5801,THESSALIA,
5802,THESSALIA,Where lay a corpse upon the naked earth
5803,THESSALIA,On ravening birds and beasts of prey the hag
5804,THESSALIA,"Kept watch, nor marred by knife or hand her spoil,"
5805,THESSALIA,Till on his victim seized some nightly wolf; (36)
5806,THESSALIA,Then dragged the morsel from his thirsty fangs;
5807,THESSALIA,"Nor fears she murder, if her rites demand"
5808,THESSALIA,"Blood from the living, or some banquet fell"
5809,THESSALIA,Requires the panting entrail.  Pregnant wombs
5810,THESSALIA,Yield to her knife the infant to be placed
5811,THESSALIA,On flaming altars: and whene'er she needs
5812,THESSALIA,"Some fierce undaunted ghost, he fails not her"
5813,THESSALIA,Who has all deaths in use.  Her hand has chased
5814,THESSALIA,From smiling cheeks the rosy bloom of life;
5815,THESSALIA,And with sinister hand from dying youth
5816,THESSALIA,Has shorn the fatal lock: and holding oft
5817,THESSALIA,In foul embraces some departed friend
5818,THESSALIA,"Severed the head, and through the ghastly lips,"
5819,THESSALIA,"Held by her own apart, some impious tale"
5820,THESSALIA,Dark with mysterious horror hath conveyed
5821,THESSALIA,Down to the Stygian shades.
5822,THESSALIA,
5823,THESSALIA,When rumour brought
5824,THESSALIA,"Her name to Sextus, in the depth of night,"
5825,THESSALIA,While Titan's chariot beneath our earth
5826,THESSALIA,"Wheeled on his middle course, he took his way"
5827,THESSALIA,"Through fields deserted; while a faithful band,"
5828,THESSALIA,"His wonted ministers in deeds of guilt,"
5829,THESSALIA,"Seeking the hag 'mid broken sepulchres,"
5830,THESSALIA,Beheld her seated on the crags afar
5831,THESSALIA,Where Haemus falls towards Pharsalia's plain. (37)
5832,THESSALIA,There was she proving for her gods and priests
5833,THESSALIA,"Words still unknown, and framing numbered chants"
5834,THESSALIA,Of dire and novel purpose: for she feared
5835,THESSALIA,"Lest Mars might stray into another world,"
5836,THESSALIA,And spare Thessalian soil the blood ere long
5837,THESSALIA,To flow in torrents; and she thus forbade
5838,THESSALIA,"Philippi's field, polluted with her song,"
5839,THESSALIA,"Thick with her poisonous distilments sown,"
5840,THESSALIA,"To let the war pass by.  Such deaths, she hopes,"
5841,THESSALIA,Soon shall be hers!  the blood of all the world
5842,THESSALIA,Shed for her use!  to her it shall be given
5843,THESSALIA,"To sever from their trunks the heads of kings,"
5844,THESSALIA,"Plunder the ashes of the noble dead,"
5845,THESSALIA,"Italia's bravest, and in triumph add"
5846,THESSALIA,The mightiest warriors to her host of shades.
5847,THESSALIA,And now what spoils from Magnus' tombless corse
5848,THESSALIA,"Her hand may snatch, on which of Caesar's limbs"
5849,THESSALIA,"She soon may pounce, she makes her foul forecast"
5850,THESSALIA,And eager gloats.
5851,THESSALIA,
5852,THESSALIA,To whom the coward son
5853,THESSALIA,"Of Magnus thus: ""Thou greatest ornament"
5854,THESSALIA,"Of Haemon's daughters, in whose power it lies"
5855,THESSALIA,"Or to reveal the fates, or from its course"
5856,THESSALIA,"To turn the future, be it mine to know"
5857,THESSALIA,By thy sure utterance to what final end
5858,THESSALIA,Fortune now guides the issue.  Not the least
5859,THESSALIA,Of all the Roman host on yonder plain
5860,THESSALIA,"Am I, but Magnus' most illustrious son,"
5861,THESSALIA,Lord of the world or heir to death and doom.
5862,THESSALIA,The unknown affrights me: I can firmly face
5863,THESSALIA,The certain terror.  Bid my destiny
5864,THESSALIA,"Yield to thy power the dark and hidden end,"
5865,THESSALIA,And let me fall foreknowing.  From the gods
5866,THESSALIA,"Extort the truth, or, if thou spare the gods,"
5867,THESSALIA,Force it from hell itself.  Fling back the gates
5868,THESSALIA,That bar th' Elysian fields; let Death confess
5869,THESSALIA,Whom from our ranks he seeks.  No humble task
5870,THESSALIA,"I bring, but worthy of Erichtho's skill"
5871,THESSALIA,Of such a struggle fought for such a prize
5872,THESSALIA,"To search and tell the issue."""
5873,THESSALIA,
5874,THESSALIA,Then the witch
5875,THESSALIA,Pleased that her impious fame was noised abroad
5876,THESSALIA,"Thus made her answer: ""If some lesser fates"
5877,THESSALIA,"Thy wish had been to change, against their wish"
5878,THESSALIA,It had been easy to compel the gods
5879,THESSALIA,To its accomplishment.  My art has power
5880,THESSALIA,When of one man the constellations press
5881,THESSALIA,"The speedy death, to compass a delay;"
5882,THESSALIA,"And mine it is, though every star decrees"
5883,THESSALIA,"A ripe old age, by mystic herbs to shear"
5884,THESSALIA,The life midway.  But should some purpose set
5885,THESSALIA,"From the beginning of the universe,"
5886,THESSALIA,"And all the labouring fortunes of mankind,"
5887,THESSALIA,"Be brought in question, then Thessalian art"
5888,THESSALIA,Bows to the power supreme.  But if thou be
5889,THESSALIA,"Content to know the issue pre-ordained,"
5890,THESSALIA,That shall be swiftly thine; for earth and air
5891,THESSALIA,And sea and space and Rhodopaean crags
5892,THESSALIA,Shall speak the future.  Yet it easiest seems
5893,THESSALIA,Where death in these Thessalian fields abounds
5894,THESSALIA,To raise a single corpse.  From dead men's lips
5895,THESSALIA,"Scarce cold, in fuller accents falls the voice;"
5896,THESSALIA,Not from some mummied flame in accents shrill
5897,THESSALIA,"Uncertain to the ear."""
5898,THESSALIA,
5899,THESSALIA,Thus spake the hag
5900,THESSALIA,"And through redoubled night, a squalid veil"
5901,THESSALIA,"Swathing her pallid features, stole among"
5902,THESSALIA,"Unburied carcases.  Fast fled the wolves,"
5903,THESSALIA,The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied
5904,THESSALIA,"Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step"
5905,THESSALIA,She sought her prophet.  Firm must be the flesh
5906,THESSALIA,"As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs"
5907,THESSALIA,Untouched by wound.  Now in the balance hung
5908,THESSALIA,The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven
5909,THESSALIA,Armies to raise and order back to life
5910,THESSALIA,"Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed"
5911,THESSALIA,"Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx,"
5912,THESSALIA,"Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,"
5913,THESSALIA,And rising fought once more.  At length the witch
5914,THESSALIA,Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape
5915,THESSALIA,Fit for her purpose.  Gripped by pitiless hook
5916,THESSALIA,O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave
5917,THESSALIA,"Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore"
5918,THESSALIA,The dead man's life.
5919,THESSALIA,
5920,THESSALIA,Close to the hidden brink
5921,THESSALIA,The land that girds the precipice of hell
5922,THESSALIA,Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves
5923,THESSALIA,"A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew"
5924,THESSALIA,Casts shade impenetrable.  Foul decay
5925,THESSALIA,"Fills all the space, and in the deep recess"
5926,THESSALIA,"Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,"
5927,THESSALIA,Reigns ever.  Not where gape the misty jaws
5928,THESSALIA,"Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound"
5929,THESSALIA,"Of either world, through which the nether kings"
5930,THESSALIA,"Permit the passage of the dead to earth,"
5931,THESSALIA,"So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air."
5932,THESSALIA,"Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades"
5933,THESSALIA,"Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave"
5934,THESSALIA,Were not a part of hell.  Discordant hues
5935,THESSALIA,Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;
5936,THESSALIA,"Bare was her visage, and upon her brow"
5937,THESSALIA,"Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks"
5938,THESSALIA,In sable coils entwined.  But when she saw
5939,THESSALIA,"The youth's companions trembling, and himself"
5940,THESSALIA,"With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,"
5941,THESSALIA,"Thus spake the witch: ""Forbid your craven souls"
5942,THESSALIA,These fears to cherish: soon returning life
5943,THESSALIA,"This frame shall quicken, and in tones which reach"
5944,THESSALIA,Even the timorous ear shall speak the man.
5945,THESSALIA,"If I have power the Stygian lakes to show,"
5946,THESSALIA,"The bank that sounds with fire, the fury band,"
5947,THESSALIA,"And giants lettered, and the hound that shakes"
5948,THESSALIA,"Bristling with heads of snakes his triple head,"
5949,THESSALIA,What fear is this that cringes at the sight
5950,THESSALIA,"Of timid shivering shades?"""
5951,THESSALIA,
5952,THESSALIA,Then to her prayer.
5953,THESSALIA,First through his gaping bosom blood she pours
5954,THESSALIA,"Still fervent, washing from his wounds the gore."
5955,THESSALIA,Then copious poisons from the moon distils
5956,THESSALIA,Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pangs
5957,THESSALIA,Bring to untimely birth; the froth from dogs
5958,THESSALIA,"Stricken with madness, foaming at the stream;"
5959,THESSALIA,A lynx's entrails: and the knot that grows
5960,THESSALIA,Upon the fell hyaena; flesh of stags
5961,THESSALIA,Fed upon serpents; and the sucking fish
5962,THESSALIA,Which holds the vessel back (38) though eastern winds
5963,THESSALIA,Make bend the canvas; dragon's eyes; and stones
5964,THESSALIA,That sound beneath the brooding eagle's wings.
5965,THESSALIA,"Nor Araby's viper, nor the ocean snake"
5966,THESSALIA,"Who in the Red Sea waters guards the shell,"
5967,THESSALIA,Are wanting; nor the slough on Libyan sands
5968,THESSALIA,By horned reptile cast; nor ashes fail
5969,THESSALIA,Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died.
5970,THESSALIA,"And viler poisons many, which herself"
5971,THESSALIA,"Has made, she adds, whereto no name is given:"
5972,THESSALIA,Pestiferous leaves pregnant with magic chants
5973,THESSALIA,And blades of grass which in their primal growth
5974,THESSALIA,Her cursed mouth had slimed.  Last came her voice
5975,THESSALIA,More potent than all herbs to charm the gods
5976,THESSALIA,Who rule in Lethe.  Dissonant murmurs first
5977,THESSALIA,And sounds discordant from the tongues of men
5978,THESSALIA,"She utters, scarce articulate: the bay"
5979,THESSALIA,"Of wolves, and barking as of dogs, were mixed"
5980,THESSALIA,With that fell chant; the screech of nightly owl
5981,THESSALIA,Raising her hoarse complaint; the howl of beast
5982,THESSALIA,And sibilant hiss of snake -- all these were there;
5983,THESSALIA,"And more -- the waft of waters on the rock,"
5984,THESSALIA,The sound of forests and the thunder peal.
5985,THESSALIA,Such was her voice; but soon in clearer tones
5986,THESSALIA,"Reaching to Tartarus, she raised her song:"
5987,THESSALIA,"""Ye awful goddesses, avenging power"
5988,THESSALIA,"Of Hell upon the damned, and Chaos huge"
5989,THESSALIA,"Who striv'st to mix innumerable worlds,"
5990,THESSALIA,"And Pluto, king of earth, whose weary soul"
5991,THESSALIA,Grieves at his godhead; Styx; and plains of bliss
5992,THESSALIA,"We may not enter: and thou, Proserpine,"
5993,THESSALIA,"Hating thy mother and the skies above,"
5994,THESSALIA,"My patron goddess, last and lowest form (39)"
5995,THESSALIA,Of Hecate through whom the shades and I
5996,THESSALIA,Hold silent converse; warder of the gate
5997,THESSALIA,Who castest human offal to the dog:
5998,THESSALIA,Ye sisters who shall spin the threads again; (40)
5999,THESSALIA,"And thou, O boatman of the burning wave,"
6000,THESSALIA,Now wearied of the shades from hell to me
6001,THESSALIA,"Returning, hear me if with voice I cry"
6002,THESSALIA,"Abhorred, polluted; if the flesh of man"
6003,THESSALIA,"Hath ne'er been absent from my proffered song,"
6004,THESSALIA,Flesh washed with brains still quivering; if the child
6005,THESSALIA,Whose severed head I placed upon the dish
6006,THESSALIA,But for this hand had lived -- a listening ear
6007,THESSALIA,Lend to my supplication!  From the caves
6008,THESSALIA,Hid in the innermost recess of hell
6009,THESSALIA,I claim no soul long banished from the light.
6010,THESSALIA,"For one but now departed, lingering still"
6011,THESSALIA,"Upon the brink of Orcus, is my prayer."
6012,THESSALIA,Grant (for ye may) that listening to the spell
6013,THESSALIA,Once more he seek his dust; and let the shade
6014,THESSALIA,Of this our soldier perished (if the war
6015,THESSALIA,"Well at your hands has merited), proclaim"
6016,THESSALIA,"The destiny of Magnus to his son."""
6017,THESSALIA,
6018,THESSALIA,"Such prayers she uttered; then, her foaming lips"
6019,THESSALIA,"And head uplifting, present saw the ghost."
6020,THESSALIA,"Hard by he stood, beside the hated corpse"
6021,THESSALIA,"His ancient prison, and loathed to enter in."
6022,THESSALIA,There was the yawning chest where fell the blow
6023,THESSALIA,That was his death; and yet the gift supreme
6024,THESSALIA,"Of death, his right, (Ah, wretch!) was reft away."
6025,THESSALIA,"Angered at Death the witch, and at the pause"
6026,THESSALIA,"Conceded by the fates, with living snake"
6027,THESSALIA,Scourges the moveless corse; and on the dead
6028,THESSALIA,"She barks through fissures gaping to her song,"
6029,THESSALIA,Breaking the silence of their gloomy home:
6030,THESSALIA,"""Tisiphone, Megaera, heed ye not?"
6031,THESSALIA,Flies not this wretched soul before your whips
6032,THESSALIA,"The void of Erebus?  By your very names,"
6033,THESSALIA,"She-dogs of hell, I'll call you to the day,"
6034,THESSALIA,Not to return; through sepulchres and death
6035,THESSALIA,Your gaoler: from funereal urns and tombs
6036,THESSALIA,"I'll chase you forth.  And thou, too, Hecate,"
6037,THESSALIA,"Who to the gods in comely shape and mien,"
6038,THESSALIA,"Not that of Erebus, appearst, henceforth"
6039,THESSALIA,Wasted and pallid as thou art in hell
6040,THESSALIA,
6041,THESSALIA,At my command shalt come.  I'll noise abroad
6042,THESSALIA,The banquet that beneath the solid earth
6043,THESSALIA,"Holds thee, thou maid of Enna; by what bond"
6044,THESSALIA,"Thou lov'st night's King, by what mysterious stain"
6045,THESSALIA,"Infected, so that Ceres fears from hell"
6046,THESSALIA,"To call her daughter.  And for thee, base king,"
6047,THESSALIA,Titan shall pierce thy caverns with his rays
6048,THESSALIA,And sudden day shall smite thee.  Do ye hear?
6049,THESSALIA,Or shall I summon to mine aid that god
6050,THESSALIA,At whose dread name earth trembles; who can look
6051,THESSALIA,"Unflinching on the Gorgon's head, and drive"
6052,THESSALIA,"The Furies with his scourge, who holds the depths"
6053,THESSALIA,"Ye cannot fathom, and above whose haunts"
6054,THESSALIA,Ye dwell supernal; who by waves of Styx
6055,THESSALIA,"Forswears himself unpunished?"""
6056,THESSALIA,
6057,THESSALIA,Then the blood
6058,THESSALIA,"Grew warm and liquid, and with softening touch"
6059,THESSALIA,"Cherished the stiffened wounds and filled the veins,"
6060,THESSALIA,Till throbbed once more the slow returning pulse
6061,THESSALIA,"And every fibre trembled, as with death"
6062,THESSALIA,"Life was commingled.  Then, not limb by limb,"
6063,THESSALIA,"With toil and strain, but rising at a bound"
6064,THESSALIA,Leaped from the earth erect the living man.
6065,THESSALIA,"Fierce glared his eyes uncovered, and the life"
6066,THESSALIA,"Was dim, and still upon his face remained"
6067,THESSALIA,The pallid hues of hardly parted death.
6068,THESSALIA,"Amazement seized upon him, to the earth"
6069,THESSALIA,Brought back again: but from his lips tight drawn
6070,THESSALIA,No murmur issued; he had power alone
6071,THESSALIA,"When questioned to reply.  ""Speak,"" quoth the hag,"
6072,THESSALIA,"""As I shall bid thee; great shall be thy gain"
6073,THESSALIA,"If but thou answerest truly, freed for aye"
6074,THESSALIA,From all Haemonian art.  Such burial place
6075,THESSALIA,"Shall now be thine, and on thy funeral pyre"
6076,THESSALIA,"Such fatal woods shall burn, such chant shall sound,"
6077,THESSALIA,That to thy ghost no more or magic song
6078,THESSALIA,"Or spell shall reach, and thy Lethaean sleep"
6079,THESSALIA,Shall never more be broken in a death
6080,THESSALIA,From me received anew: for such reward
6081,THESSALIA,Think not this second life enforced in vain.
6082,THESSALIA,Obscure may be the answers of the gods
6083,THESSALIA,By priestess spoken at the holy shrine;
6084,THESSALIA,But whose braves the oracles of death
6085,THESSALIA,"In search of truth, should gain a sure response."
6086,THESSALIA,"Then speak, I pray thee.  Let the hidden fates"
6087,THESSALIA,"Tell through thy voice the mysteries to come."""
6088,THESSALIA,
6089,THESSALIA,"Thus spake she, and her words by mystic force"
6090,THESSALIA,"Gave him his answer; but with gloomy mien,"
6091,THESSALIA,"And tears swift flowing, thus he made reply:"
6092,THESSALIA,"""Called from the margin of the silent stream"
6093,THESSALIA,I saw no fateful sisters spin the threads.
6094,THESSALIA,"Yet know I this, that 'mid the Roman shades"
6095,THESSALIA,Reigns fiercest discord; and this impious war
6096,THESSALIA,Destroys the peace that ruled the fields of death.
6097,THESSALIA,Elysian meads and deeps of Tartarus
6098,THESSALIA,In paths diverse the Roman chieftains leave
6099,THESSALIA,And thus disclose the fates.  The blissful ghosts
6100,THESSALIA,Bear visages of sorrow.  Sire and son
6101,THESSALIA,"The Decii, who gave themselves to death"
6102,THESSALIA,"In expiation of their country's doom,"
6103,THESSALIA,"And great Camillus, wept; and Sulla's shade"
6104,THESSALIA,Complained of fortune.  Scipio bewailed
6105,THESSALIA,The scion of his race about to fall
6106,THESSALIA,"In sands of Libya: Cato, greatest foe"
6107,THESSALIA,"To Carthage, grieves for that indignant soul"
6108,THESSALIA,Which shall disdain to serve.  Brutus alone
6109,THESSALIA,"In all the happy ranks I smiling saw,"
6110,THESSALIA,First consul when the kings were thrust from Rome.
6111,THESSALIA,The chains were fallen from boastful Catiline.
6112,THESSALIA,"Him too I saw rejoicing, and the pair"
6113,THESSALIA,"Of Marii, and Cethegus' naked arm. (41)"
6114,THESSALIA,"The Drusi, heroes of the people, joyed,"
6115,THESSALIA,In laws immoderate; and the famous pair (42)
6116,THESSALIA,Of greatly daring brothers: guilty bands
6117,THESSALIA,By bars eternal shut within the doors
6118,THESSALIA,"That close the prison of hell, applaud the fates,"
6119,THESSALIA,Claiming the plains Elysian: and the King
6120,THESSALIA,"Throws wide his pallid halls, makes hard the points"
6121,THESSALIA,"Of craggy rocks, and forges iron chains,"
6122,THESSALIA,The victor's punishment.  But take with thee
6123,THESSALIA,"This comfort, youth, that there a calm abode,"
6124,THESSALIA,"And peaceful, waits thy father and his house."
6125,THESSALIA,Nor let the glory of a little span
6126,THESSALIA,Disturb thy boding heart: the hour shall come
6127,THESSALIA,"When all the chiefs shall meet.  Shrink not from death,"
6128,THESSALIA,"But glowing in the greatness of your souls,"
6129,THESSALIA,"E'en from your humble sepulchres descend,"
6130,THESSALIA,"And tread beneath your feet, in pride of place,"
6131,THESSALIA,The wandering phantoms of the gods of Rome. (43)
6132,THESSALIA,"Which of the chiefs by Tiber's yellow stream,"
6133,THESSALIA,And which by Nile shall rest (the leaders' fate)
6134,THESSALIA,"This fight decides, no more.  Nor seek to know"
6135,THESSALIA,From me thy fortunes: for the fates in time
6136,THESSALIA,"Shall give thee all thy due; and thy great sire, (44)"
6137,THESSALIA,"A surer prophet, in Sicilian fields"
6138,THESSALIA,Shall speak thy future -- doubting even he
6139,THESSALIA,What regions of the world thou should'st avoid
6140,THESSALIA,And what should'st seek.  O miserable race!
6141,THESSALIA,"Europe and Asia and Libya's plains, (45)"
6142,THESSALIA,"Which saw your conquests, now shall hold alike"

6505,THE BATTLE,And from the altar fled the frantic bull
6506,THE BATTLE,To fields afar; nor was a victim found
6507,THE BATTLE,To grace the sacrifice of coming doom.
6508,THE BATTLE,
6509,THE BATTLE,"But thou, Caesar, to what gods of ill"
6510,THE BATTLE,"Didst thou appeal?  What furies didst thou call,"
6511,THE BATTLE,What powers of madness and what Stygian Kings
6512,THE BATTLE,Whelmed in th' abyss of hell?  Didst favour gain
6513,THE BATTLE,By sacrifice in this thine impious war?
6514,THE BATTLE,Strange sights were seen; or caused by hands divine
6515,THE BATTLE,Or due to fearful fancy.  Haemus' top
6516,THE BATTLE,"Plunged headlong in the valley, Pindus met"
6517,THE BATTLE,"With high Olympus, while at Ossa's feet"
6518,THE BATTLE,"Red ran Baebeis, (8) and Pharsalia's field"
6519,THE BATTLE,Gave warlike voices forth in depth of night.
6520,THE BATTLE,"Now darkness came upon their wondering gaze,"
6521,THE BATTLE,"Now daylight pale and wan, their helmets wreathed"
6522,THE BATTLE,In pallid mist; the spirits of their sires
6523,THE BATTLE,"Hovered in air, and shades of kindred dead"
6524,THE BATTLE,Passed flitting through the gloom.  Yet to the host
6525,THE BATTLE,Conscious of guilty prayers which sought to shed
6526,THE BATTLE,"The blood of sires and brothers, earth and air"
6527,THE BATTLE,"Distraught, and horrors seething in their hearts"
6528,THE BATTLE,Gave happy omen of the end to come.
6529,THE BATTLE,
6530,THE BATTLE,Was't strange that peoples whom their latest day
6531,THE BATTLE,Of happy life awaited (if their minds
6532,THE BATTLE,Foreknew the doom) should tremble with affright?
6533,THE BATTLE,"Romans who dwelt by far Araxes' stream,"
6534,THE BATTLE,"And Tyrian Gades, (9) in whatever clime,"
6535,THE BATTLE,"'Neath every sky, struck by mysterious dread"
6536,THE BATTLE,"Were plunged in sorrow -- yet rebuked the tear,"
6537,THE BATTLE,For yet they knew not of the fatal day.
6538,THE BATTLE,Thus on Euganean hills (10) where sulphurous fumes
6539,THE BATTLE,"Disclose the rise of Aponus (11) from earth,"
6540,THE BATTLE,"And where Timavus broadens in the meads,"
6541,THE BATTLE,"An augur spake: ""This day the fight is fought,"
6542,THE BATTLE,The arms of Caesar and Pompeius meet
6543,THE BATTLE,"To end the impious conflict.""  Or he saw"
6544,THE BATTLE,"The bolts of Jupiter, predicting ill;"
6545,THE BATTLE,Or else the sky discordant o'er the space
6546,THE BATTLE,"Of heaven, from pole to pole; or else perchance"
6547,THE BATTLE,The sun was sad and misty in the height
6548,THE BATTLE,And told the battle by his wasted beams.
6549,THE BATTLE,By Nature's fiat that Thessalian day
6550,THE BATTLE,Passed not as others; if the gifted sense
6551,THE BATTLE,"Of reading portents had been given to all,"
6552,THE BATTLE,All men had known Pharsalia.  Gods of heaven!
6553,THE BATTLE,How do ye mark the great ones of the earth!
6554,THE BATTLE,The world gives tokens of their weal or woe;
6555,THE BATTLE,The sky records their fates: in distant climes
6556,THE BATTLE,"To future races shall their tale be told,"
6557,THE BATTLE,Or by the fame alone of mighty deeds
6558,THE BATTLE,"Had in remembrance, or by this my care"
6559,THE BATTLE,Borne through the centuries: and men shall read
6560,THE BATTLE,In hope and fear the story of the war
6561,THE BATTLE,"And breathless pray, as though it were to come,"
6562,THE BATTLE,For that long since accomplished; and for thee
6563,THE BATTLE,"Thus far, Pompeius, shall that prayer be given."
6564,THE BATTLE,
6565,THE BATTLE,"Reflected from their arms, th' opposing sun"
6566,THE BATTLE,Filled all the slope with radiance as they marched
6567,THE BATTLE,"In ordered ranks to that ill-fated fight,"
6568,THE BATTLE,And stood arranged for battle.  On the left
6569,THE BATTLE,"Thou, Lentulus, had'st charge; two legions there,"
6570,THE BATTLE,"The fourth, and bravest of them all, the first:"
6571,THE BATTLE,"While on the right, Domitius, ever stanch,"
6572,THE BATTLE,"Though fates be adverse, stood: in middle line"
6573,THE BATTLE,"The hardy soldiers from Cilician lands,"
6574,THE BATTLE,"In Scipio's care; their chief in Libyan days,"
6575,THE BATTLE,To-day their comrade.  By Enipeus' pools
6576,THE BATTLE,"And by the rivulets, the mountain troops"
6577,THE BATTLE,"Of Cappadocia, and loose of rein"
6578,THE BATTLE,"Thy squadrons, Pontus: on the firmer ground"
6579,THE BATTLE,Galatia's tetrarchs and the greater kings;
6580,THE BATTLE,"And all the purple-robed, the slaves of Rome."
6581,THE BATTLE,"Numidian hordes were there from Afric shores,"
6582,THE BATTLE,There Creta's host and Ituraeans found
6583,THE BATTLE,Full space to wing their arrows; there the tribes
6584,THE BATTLE,"From brave Iberia clashed their shields, and there"
6585,THE BATTLE,Gaul stood arrayed against her ancient foe.
6586,THE BATTLE,"Let all the nations be the victor's prize,"
6587,THE BATTLE,None grace in future a triumphal car;
6588,THE BATTLE,This fight demands the slaughter of a world.
6589,THE BATTLE,
6590,THE BATTLE,Caesar that day to send his troops for spoil
6591,THE BATTLE,"Had left his tent, when on the further hill"
6592,THE BATTLE,Behold!  his foe descending to the plain.
6593,THE BATTLE,The moment asked for by a thousand prayers
6594,THE BATTLE,"Is come, which puts his fortune on the risk"
6595,THE BATTLE,"Of imminent war, to win or lose it all."
6596,THE BATTLE,For burning with desire of kingly power
6597,THE BATTLE,His eager soul ill brooked the small delay
6598,THE BATTLE,This civil war compelled: each instant lost
6599,THE BATTLE,Robbed from his due!  But when at length he knew
6600,THE BATTLE,"The last great conflict come, the fight supreme,"
6601,THE BATTLE,Whose prize the leadership of all the world:
6602,THE BATTLE,And felt the ruin nodding to its fall:
6603,THE BATTLE,"Swiftest to strike, yet for a little space"
6604,THE BATTLE,His rage for battle failed; the spirit bold
6605,THE BATTLE,"To pledge itself the issue, wavered now:"
6606,THE BATTLE,"For Magnus' fortunes gave no room for hope,"
6607,THE BATTLE,Though Caesar's none for fear.  Deep in his soul
6608,THE BATTLE,"Such doubt was hidden, as with mien and speech"
6609,THE BATTLE,"That augured victory, thus the chief began:"
6610,THE BATTLE,"""Ye conquerors of a world, my hope in all,"
6611,THE BATTLE,"Prayed for so oft, the dawn of fight is come."
6612,THE BATTLE,No more entreat the gods: with sword in hand
6613,THE BATTLE,Seize on our fates; and Caesar in your deeds
6614,THE BATTLE,This day is great or little.  This the day
6615,THE BATTLE,For which I hold since Rubicon was passed
6616,THE BATTLE,Your promise given: for this we flew to arms: (12)
6617,THE BATTLE,"For this deferred the triumphs we had won,"
6618,THE BATTLE,And which the foe refused: this gives you back
6619,THE BATTLE,"Your homes and kindred, and the peaceful farm,"
6620,THE BATTLE,Your prize for years of service in the field.
6621,THE BATTLE,And by the fates' command this day shall prove
6622,THE BATTLE,Whose quarrel juster: for defeat is guilt
6623,THE BATTLE,To him on whom it falls.  If in my cause
6624,THE BATTLE,"With fire and sword ye did your country wrong,"
6625,THE BATTLE,Strike for acquittal!  Should another judge
6626,THE BATTLE,"This war, not Caesar, none were blameless found."
6627,THE BATTLE,"Not for my sake this battle, but for you,"
6628,THE BATTLE,"To give you, soldiers, liberty and law"
6629,THE BATTLE,'Gainst all the world.  Wishful myself for life
6630,THE BATTLE,"Apart from public cares, and for the gown"
6631,THE BATTLE,"That robes the private citizen, I refuse"
6632,THE BATTLE,To yield from office till the law allows
6633,THE BATTLE,Your right in all things.  On my shoulders rest
6634,THE BATTLE,All blame; all power be yours.  Nor deep the blood
6635,THE BATTLE,Between yourselves and conquest.  Grecian schools
6636,THE BATTLE,Of exercise and wrestling (13) send us here
6637,THE BATTLE,Their chosen darlings to await your swords;
6638,THE BATTLE,"And scarcely armed for war, a dissonant crowd"
6639,THE BATTLE,"Barbaric, that will start to hear our trump,"
6640,THE BATTLE,"Nay, their own clamour.  Not in civil strife"
6641,THE BATTLE,Your blows shall fall -- the battle of to-day
6642,THE BATTLE,Sweeps from the earth the enemies of Rome.
6643,THE BATTLE,Dash through these cowards and their vaunted kings:
6644,THE BATTLE,One stroke of sword and all the world is yours.
6645,THE BATTLE,Make plain to all men that the crowds who decked
6646,THE BATTLE,Pompeius' hundred pageants scarce were fit
6647,THE BATTLE,For one poor triumph.  Shall Armenia care
6648,THE BATTLE,"Who leads her masters, or barbarians shed"
6649,THE BATTLE,One drop of blood to make Pompeius chief
6650,THE BATTLE,"O'er our Italia?  Rome, 'tis Rome they hate"
6651,THE BATTLE,And all her children; yet they hate the most
6652,THE BATTLE,Those whom they know.  My fate is in the hands
6653,THE BATTLE,"Of you, mine own true soldiers, proved in all"
6654,THE BATTLE,The wars we fought in Gallia.  When the sword
6655,THE BATTLE,"Of each of you shall strike, I know the hand:"
6656,THE BATTLE,The javelin's flight to me betrays the arm
6657,THE BATTLE,That launched it hurtling: and to-day once more
6658,THE BATTLE,"I see the faces stern, the threatening eyes,"
6659,THE BATTLE,Unfailing proofs of victory to come.
6660,THE BATTLE,E'en now the battle rushes on my sight;
6661,THE BATTLE,Kings trodden down and scattered senators
6662,THE BATTLE,"Fill all th' ensanguined plain, and peoples float"
6663,THE BATTLE,Unnumbered on the crimson tide of death.
6664,THE BATTLE,Enough of words -- I but delay the fates;
6665,THE BATTLE,"And you who burn to dash into the fray,"
6666,THE BATTLE,Forgive the pause.  I tremble with the hopes (14)
6667,THE BATTLE,Thus finding utterance.  I ne'er have seen
6668,THE BATTLE,The mighty gods so near; this little field
6669,THE BATTLE,Alone dividing us; their hands are full
6670,THE BATTLE,Of my predestined honours: for 'tis I
6671,THE BATTLE,Who when this war is done shall have the power
6672,THE BATTLE,"O'er all that peoples, all that kings enjoy"
6673,THE BATTLE,To shower it where I will.  But has the pole
6674,THE BATTLE,"Been moved, or in its nightly course some star"
6675,THE BATTLE,"Turned backwards, that such mighty deeds should pass"
6676,THE BATTLE,Here on Thessalian earth?  To-day we reap
6677,THE BATTLE,Of all our wars the harvest or the doom.
6678,THE BATTLE,"Think of the cross that threats us, and the chain,"
6679,THE BATTLE,"Limbs hacked asunder, Caesar's head displayed"
6680,THE BATTLE,Upon the rostra; and that narrow field
6681,THE BATTLE,Piled up with slaughter: for this hostile chief
6682,THE BATTLE,"Is savage Sulla's pupil.  'Tis for you,"
6683,THE BATTLE,"If conquered, that I grieve: my lot apart"
6684,THE BATTLE,"Is cast long since.  This sword, should one of you"
6685,THE BATTLE,"Turn from the battle ere the foe be fled,"
6686,THE BATTLE,"Shall rob the life of Caesar.  O ye gods,"
6687,THE BATTLE,"Drawn down from heaven by the throes of Rome,"
6688,THE BATTLE,May he be conqueror who shall not draw
6689,THE BATTLE,"Against the vanquished an inhuman sword,"
6690,THE BATTLE,Nor count it as a crime if men of Rome
6691,THE BATTLE,Preferred another's standard to his own.
6692,THE BATTLE,Pompeius' sword drank deep Italian blood
6693,THE BATTLE,When cabined in yon space the brave man's arm
6694,THE BATTLE,"No more found room to strike.  But you, I pray,"
6695,THE BATTLE,"Touch not the foe who turns him from the fight,"
6696,THE BATTLE,"A fellow citizen, a foe no more."
6697,THE BATTLE,"But while the gleaming weapons threaten still,"
6698,THE BATTLE,"Let no fond memories unnerve the arm, (15)"
6699,THE BATTLE,No pious thought of father or of kin;
6700,THE BATTLE,"But full in face of brother or of sire,"
6701,THE BATTLE,Drive home the blade.  Unless the slain be known
6702,THE BATTLE,Your foes account his slaughter as a crime;
6703,THE BATTLE,"Spare not our camp, but lay the rampart low"
6704,THE BATTLE,And fill the fosse with ruin; not a man
6705,THE BATTLE,But holds his post within the ranks to-day.
6706,THE BATTLE,"And yonder tents, deserted by the foe,"
6707,THE BATTLE,"Shall give us shelter when the rout is done."""
6708,THE BATTLE,
6709,THE BATTLE,"Scarce had he paused; they snatch the hasty meal,"
6710,THE BATTLE,And seize their armour and with swift acclaim
6711,THE BATTLE,"Welcome the chief's predictions of the day,"
6712,THE BATTLE,Tread low their camp when rushing to the fight;
6713,THE BATTLE,"And take their post: nor word nor order given,"
6714,THE BATTLE,"In fate they put their trust.  Nor, had'st thou placed"
6715,THE BATTLE,"All Caesars there, all striving for the throne"
6716,THE BATTLE,"Of Rome their city, had their serried ranks"
6717,THE BATTLE,With speedier tread dashed down upon the foe.
6718,THE BATTLE,
6719,THE BATTLE,But when Pompeius saw the hostile troops
6720,THE BATTLE,"Move forth in order and demand the fight,"
6721,THE BATTLE,"And knew the gods' approval of the day,"
6722,THE BATTLE,"He stood astonied, while a deadly chill"
6723,THE BATTLE,"Struck to his heart -- omen itself of woe,"
6724,THE BATTLE,"That such a chief should at the call to arms,"
6725,THE BATTLE,"Thus dread the issue: but with fear repressed,"
6726,THE BATTLE,Borne on his noble steed along the line
6727,THE BATTLE,"Of all his forces, thus he spake: ""The day"
6728,THE BATTLE,"Your bravery demands, that final end"
6729,THE BATTLE,"Of civil war ye asked for, is at hand."
6730,THE BATTLE,"Put forth your strength, your all; the sword to-day"
6731,THE BATTLE,Does its last work.  One crowded hour is charged
6732,THE BATTLE,With nations' destinies.  Whoe'er of you
6733,THE BATTLE,"Longs for his land and home, his wife and child,"
6734,THE BATTLE,"Seek them with sword.  Here in mid battle-field,"
6735,THE BATTLE,The gods place all at stake.  Our better right
6736,THE BATTLE,Bids us expect their favour; they shall dip
6737,THE BATTLE,"Your brands in Caesar's blood, and thus shall give"
6738,THE BATTLE,"Another sanction to the laws of Rome,"
6739,THE BATTLE,Our cause of battle.  If for him were meant
6740,THE BATTLE,"An empire o'er the world, had they not put"
6741,THE BATTLE,An end to Magnus' life?  That I am chief
6742,THE BATTLE,Of all these mingled peoples and of Rome
6743,THE BATTLE,Disproves an angry heaven.  See here combined
6744,THE BATTLE,All means of victory.  Noble men have sought
6745,THE BATTLE,Unasked the risks of war.  Our soldiers boast
6746,THE BATTLE,Ancestral statues.  If to us were given
6747,THE BATTLE,"A Curius, if Camillus were returned,"
6748,THE BATTLE,"Or patriot Decius to devote his life,"
6749,THE BATTLE,Here would they take their stand.  From furthest east
6750,THE BATTLE,"All nations gathered, cities as the sand"
6751,THE BATTLE,"Unnumbered, give their aid: a world complete"
6752,THE BATTLE,Serves 'neath our standards.  North and south and all
6753,THE BATTLE,"Who have their being 'neath the starry vault,"
6754,THE BATTLE,Here meet in arms conjoined: And shall we not
6755,THE BATTLE,Crush with our closing wings this paltry foe?
6756,THE BATTLE,Few shall find room to strike; the rest with voice
6757,THE BATTLE,Must be content to aid: for Caesar's ranks
6758,THE BATTLE,Suffice not for us.  Think from Rome's high walls
6759,THE BATTLE,The matrons watch you with their hair unbound;
6760,THE BATTLE,"Think that the Senate hoar, too old for arms,"
6761,THE BATTLE,"With snowy locks outspread; and Rome herself,"
6762,THE BATTLE,"The world's high mistress, fearing now, alas!"
6763,THE BATTLE,A despot -- all exhort you to the fight.
6764,THE BATTLE,Think that the people that is and that shall be
6765,THE BATTLE,"Joins in the prayer -- in freedom to be born,"
6766,THE BATTLE,"In freedom die, their wish.  If 'mid these vows"
6767,THE BATTLE,"Be still found place for mine, with wife and child,"
6768,THE BATTLE,"So far as Imperator may, I bend"
6769,THE BATTLE,Before you suppliant -- unless this fight
6770,THE BATTLE,"Be won, behold me exile, your disgrace,"
6771,THE BATTLE,"My kinsman's scorn.  From this, 'tis yours to save."
6772,THE BATTLE,"Then save!  Nor in the latest stage of life,"
6773,THE BATTLE,"Let Magnus be a slave."""
6774,THE BATTLE,
6775,THE BATTLE,Then burned their souls
6776,THE BATTLE,"At these his words, indignant at the thought,"
6777,THE BATTLE,"And Rome rose up within them, and to die"
6778,THE BATTLE,Was welcome.
6779,THE BATTLE,
6780,THE BATTLE,Thus alike with hearts aflame
6781,THE BATTLE,"Moved either host to battle, one in fear"
6782,THE BATTLE,And one in hope of empire.  These hands shall do
6783,THE BATTLE,Such work as not the rolling centuries
6784,THE BATTLE,Not all mankind though free from sword and war
6785,THE BATTLE,Shall e'er make good.  Nations that were to live
6786,THE BATTLE,"This fight shall crush, and peoples pre-ordained"
6787,THE BATTLE,To make the history of the coming world
6788,THE BATTLE,Shall come not to the birth.  The Latin names
6789,THE BATTLE,"Shall sound as fables in the ears of men,"
6790,THE BATTLE,And ruins loaded with the dust of years
6791,THE BATTLE,"Shall hardly mark her cities.  Alba's hill,"
6792,THE BATTLE,"Home of our gods, no human foot shall tread,"
6793,THE BATTLE,Save of some Senator at the ancient feast
6794,THE BATTLE,By Numa's orders founded -- he compelled
6795,THE BATTLE,Serves his high office. (16)  Void and desolate
6796,THE BATTLE,"Are Veii, Cora and Laurentum's hold;"
6797,THE BATTLE,Yet not the tooth of envious time destroyed
6798,THE BATTLE,These storied monuments -- 'twas civil war
6799,THE BATTLE,That rased their citadels.  Where now hath fled
6800,THE BATTLE,The teeming life that once Italia knew?
6801,THE BATTLE,Not all the earth can furnish her with men:
6802,THE BATTLE,Untenanted her dwellings and her fields:
6803,THE BATTLE,Slaves till her soil: one city holds us all:
6804,THE BATTLE,"Crumbling to ruin, the ancestral roof"
6805,THE BATTLE,"Finds none on whom to fall; and Rome herself,"
6806,THE BATTLE,"Void of her citizens, draws within her gates"
6807,THE BATTLE,The dregs of all the world.  That none might wage
6808,THE BATTLE,"A civil war again, thus deeply drank"
6809,THE BATTLE,Pharsalia's fight the life-blood of her sons.
6810,THE BATTLE,"Dark in the calendar of Rome for aye,"
6811,THE BATTLE,The days when Allia and Cannae fell:
6812,THE BATTLE,"And shall Pharsalus' morn, darkest of all,"
6813,THE BATTLE,"Stand on the page unmarked?  Alas, the fates!"
6814,THE BATTLE,"Not plague nor pestilence nor famine's rage,"
6815,THE BATTLE,"Not cities given to the flames, nor towns"
6816,THE BATTLE,Trembling at shock of earthquake shall weigh down
6817,THE BATTLE,"Such heroes lost, when Fortune's ruthless hand"
6818,THE BATTLE,"Lops at one blow the gift of centuries,"
6819,THE BATTLE,"Leaders and men embattled.  How great art thou,"
6820,THE BATTLE,"Rome, in thy fall!  Stretched to the widest bounds"
6821,THE BATTLE,War upon war laid nations at thy feet
6822,THE BATTLE,Till flaming Titan nigh to either pole
6823,THE BATTLE,Beheld thine empire; and the furthest east
6824,THE BATTLE,"Was almost thine, till day and night and sky"
6825,THE BATTLE,"For thee revolved, and all the stars could see"
6826,THE BATTLE,Throughout their course was Roman.  But the fates
6827,THE BATTLE,In one dread day of slaughter and despair
6828,THE BATTLE,Turned back the centuries and spoke thy doom.
6829,THE BATTLE,And now the Indian fears the axe no more
6830,THE BATTLE,"Once emblem of thy power, now no more"
6831,THE BATTLE,"The girded Consul curbs the Getan horde,"
6832,THE BATTLE,Or in Sarmatian furrows guides the share: (17)
6833,THE BATTLE,Still Parthia boasts her triumphs unavenged:
6834,THE BATTLE,"Foul is the public life; and Freedom, fled"
6835,THE BATTLE,"To furthest Earth beyond the Tigris' stream,"
6836,THE BATTLE,"And Rhine's broad river, wandering at her will"
6837,THE BATTLE,"'Mid Teuton hordes and Scythian, though by sword"
6838,THE BATTLE,"Sought, yet returns not.  Would that from the day"
6839,THE BATTLE,"When Romulus, aided by the vulture's flight,"
6840,THE BATTLE,"Ill-omened, raised within that hateful grove"
6841,THE BATTLE,"Rome's earliest walls, down to the crimsoned field"
6842,THE BATTLE,"In dire Thessalia fought, she ne'er had known"
6843,THE BATTLE,Italia's peoples!  Did the Bruti strike
6844,THE BATTLE,In vain for liberty?  Why laws and rights
6845,THE BATTLE,Sanctioned by all the annals designate
6846,THE BATTLE,With consular titles?  Happier far the Medes
6847,THE BATTLE,"And blest Arabia, and the Eastern lands"
6848,THE BATTLE,Held by a kindlier fate in despot rule!
6849,THE BATTLE,That nation serves the worst which serves with shame.
6850,THE BATTLE,No guardian gods watch over us from heaven:
6851,THE BATTLE,Jove (18) is no king; let ages whirl along
6852,THE BATTLE,In blind confusion: from his throne supreme
6853,THE BATTLE,Shall he behold such carnage and restrain
6854,THE BATTLE,His thunderbolts?  On Mimas shall he hurl
6855,THE BATTLE,"His fires, on Rhodope and Oeta's woods"
6856,THE BATTLE,"Unmeriting such chastisement, and leave"
6857,THE BATTLE,This life to Cassius' hand?  On Argos fell
6858,THE BATTLE,At grim Thyestes' feast (19) untimely night
6859,THE BATTLE,By him thus hastened; shall Thessalia's land
6860,THE BATTLE,"Receive full daylight, wielding kindred swords"
6861,THE BATTLE,In fathers' hands and brothers'?  Careless of men
6862,THE BATTLE,Are all the gods.  Yet for this day of doom
6863,THE BATTLE,Such vengeance have we reaped as deities
6864,THE BATTLE,May give to mortals; for these wars shall raise
6865,THE BATTLE,Our parted Caesars to the gods; and Rome
6866,THE BATTLE,"Shall deck their effigies with thunderbolts,"
6867,THE BATTLE,"And stars and rays, and in the very fanes"
6868,THE BATTLE,Swear by the shades of men.
6869,THE BATTLE,
6870,THE BATTLE,With swift advance
6871,THE BATTLE,They seize the space that yet delays the fates
6872,THE BATTLE,Till short the span dividing.  Then they gaze
6873,THE BATTLE,"For one short moment where may fall the spear,"
6874,THE BATTLE,"What hand may deal their death, what monstrous task"
6875,THE BATTLE,"Soon shall be theirs; and all in arms they see,"
6876,THE BATTLE,"In reach of stroke, their brothers and their sires"
6877,THE BATTLE,With front opposing; yet to yield their ground
6878,THE BATTLE,It pleased them not.  But all the host was dumb
6879,THE BATTLE,"With horror; cold upon each loving heart,"
6880,THE BATTLE,"Awe-struck, the life-blood pressed; and all men held"
6881,THE BATTLE,"With arms outstretched their javelins for a time,"
6882,THE BATTLE,Poised yet unthrown.  Now may th' avenging gods
6883,THE BATTLE,"Allot thee, Crastinus, (20) not such a death"
6884,THE BATTLE,As all men else do suffer!  In the tomb
6885,THE BATTLE,May'st thou have feeling and remembrance still!
6886,THE BATTLE,"For thine the hand that first flung forth the dart,"
6887,THE BATTLE,Which stained with Roman blood Thessalia's earth.
6888,THE BATTLE,Madman!  To speed thy lance when Caesar's self
6889,THE BATTLE,Still held his hand!  Then from the clarions broke
6890,THE BATTLE,"The strident summons, and the trumpets blared"
6891,THE BATTLE,Responsive signal.  Upward to the vault
6892,THE BATTLE,The sound re-echoes where nor clouds may reach
6893,THE BATTLE,Nor thunder penetrate; and Haemus' slopes (21)
6894,THE BATTLE,Reverberate to Pelion the din;
6895,THE BATTLE,Pindus re-echoes; Oeta's lofty rocks
6896,THE BATTLE,"Groan, and Pangaean cliffs, till at their rage"
6897,THE BATTLE,Borne back from all the earth they shook for fear.
6898,THE BATTLE,
6899,THE BATTLE,"Unnumbered darts they hurl, with prayers diverse;"
6900,THE BATTLE,"Some hope to wound: others, in secret, yearn"
6901,THE BATTLE,"For hands still innocent.  Chance rules supreme,"
6902,THE BATTLE,And wayward Fortune upon whom she wills
6903,THE BATTLE,Makes fall the guilt.  Yet for the hatred bred
6904,THE BATTLE,"By civil war suffices spear nor lance,"
6905,THE BATTLE,Urged on their flight afar: the hand must grip
6906,THE BATTLE,The sword and drive it to the foeman's heart.
6907,THE BATTLE,"But while Pompeius' ranks, shield wedged to shield,"
6908,THE BATTLE,"Were ranged in dense array, and scarce had space"
6909,THE BATTLE,"To draw the blade, came rushing at the charge"
6910,THE BATTLE,"Full on the central column Caesar's host,"
6911,THE BATTLE,Mad for the battle.  Man nor arms could stay
6912,THE BATTLE,"The crash of onset, and the furious sword"
6913,THE BATTLE,"Clove through the stubborn panoply to the flesh,"
6914,THE BATTLE,There only stayed.  One army struck -- their foes
6915,THE BATTLE,"Struck not in answer; Magnus' swords were cold,"
6916,THE BATTLE,But Caesar's reeked with slaughter and with guilt.
6917,THE BATTLE,"Nor Fortune lingered, but decreed the doom"
6918,THE BATTLE,Which swept the ruins of a world away.
6919,THE BATTLE,
6920,THE BATTLE,"Soon as withdrawn from all the spacious plain,"
6921,THE BATTLE,Pompeius' horse was ranged upon the flanks;
6922,THE BATTLE,"Passed through the outer files, the lighter armed"
6923,THE BATTLE,"Of all the nations joined the central strife,"
6924,THE BATTLE,"With divers weapons armed, but all for blood"
6925,THE BATTLE,"Of Rome athirst: then blazing torches flew,"
6926,THE BATTLE,Arrows and stones. and ponderous balls of lead
6927,THE BATTLE,Molten by speed of passage through the air.
6928,THE BATTLE,There Ituraean archers and the Mede
6929,THE BATTLE,Winged forth their countless shafts till all the sky
6930,THE BATTLE,Grew dark with missiles hurled; and from the night
6931,THE BATTLE,"Brooding above, Death struck his victims down,"
6932,THE BATTLE,"Guiltless such blow, while all the crime was heaped"
6933,THE BATTLE,Upon the Roman spear.  In line oblique
6934,THE BATTLE,Behind the standards Caesar in reserve
6935,THE BATTLE,"Had placed some companies of foot, in fear"
6936,THE BATTLE,"The foremost ranks might waver.  These at his word,"
6937,THE BATTLE,"No trumpet sounding, break upon the ranks"
6938,THE BATTLE,Of Magnus' horsemen where they rode at large
6939,THE BATTLE,"Flanking the battle.  They, unshamed of fear"
6940,THE BATTLE,"And careless of the fray, when first a steed"
6941,THE BATTLE,Pierced through by javelin spurned with sounding hoof
6942,THE BATTLE,"The temples of his rider, turned the rein,"
6943,THE BATTLE,And through their comrades spurring from the field
6944,THE BATTLE,"In panic, proved that not with warring Rome"
6945,THE BATTLE,Barbarians may grapple.  Then arose
6946,THE BATTLE,"Immeasurable carnage: here the sword,"
6947,THE BATTLE,"There stood the victim, and the victor's arm"
6948,THE BATTLE,"Wearied of slaughter.  Oh, that to thy plains,"
6949,THE BATTLE,"Pharsalia, might suffice the crimson stream"
6950,THE BATTLE,"From hosts barbarian, nor other blood"
6951,THE BATTLE,Pollute thy fountains' sources!  these alone
6952,THE BATTLE,Shall clothe thy pastures with the bones of men!
6953,THE BATTLE,Or if thy fields must run with Roman blood
6954,THE BATTLE,Then spare the nations who in times to come
6955,THE BATTLE,Must be her peoples!
6956,THE BATTLE,
6957,THE BATTLE,Now the terror spread
6958,THE BATTLE,"Through all the army, and the favouring fates"
6959,THE BATTLE,Decreed for Caesar's triumph: and the war
6960,THE BATTLE,"Ceased in the wider plain, though still ablaze"
6961,THE BATTLE,"Where stood the chosen of Pompeius' force,"
6962,THE BATTLE,Upholding yet the fight.  Not here allies
6963,THE BATTLE,Begged from some distant king to wield the sword:
6964,THE BATTLE,"Here were the Roman sons, the sires of Rome,"
6965,THE BATTLE,Here the last frenzy and the last despair:
6966,THE BATTLE,"Here, Caesar, was thy crime: and here shall stay"
6967,THE BATTLE,My Muse repelled: no poesy of mine
6968,THE BATTLE,"Shall tell the horrors of the final strife,"
6969,THE BATTLE,Nor for the coming ages paint the deeds
6970,THE BATTLE,Which civil war permits.  Be all obscured
6971,THE BATTLE,In deepest darkness!  Spare the useless tear
6972,THE BATTLE,"And vain lament, and let the deeds that fell"
6973,THE BATTLE,In that last fight of Rome remain unsung.
6974,THE BATTLE,
6975,THE BATTLE,But Caesar adding fury to the breasts
6976,THE BATTLE,"Already flaming with the rage of war,"
6977,THE BATTLE,That each might bear his portion of the guilt
6978,THE BATTLE,"Which stained the host, unflinching through the ranks"
6979,THE BATTLE,"Passed at his will.  He looked upon the brands,"
6980,THE BATTLE,"These reddened only at the point, and those"
6981,THE BATTLE,"Streaming with blood and gory, to the hilt:"
6982,THE BATTLE,"He marks the hand which trembling grasped the sword,"
6983,THE BATTLE,"Or held it idle, and the cheek that grew"
6984,THE BATTLE,"Pale at the blow, and that which at his words"
6985,THE BATTLE,Glowed with the joy of battle: midst the dead
6986,THE BATTLE,He treads the plain and on each gaping wound
6987,THE BATTLE,Presses his hand to keep the life within.
6988,THE BATTLE,Thus Caesar passed: and where his footsteps fell
6989,THE BATTLE,"As when Bellona shakes her crimson lash,"
6990,THE BATTLE,Or Mavors scourges on the Thracian mares (22)
6991,THE BATTLE,"When shunning the dread face on Pallas' shield,"
6992,THE BATTLE,"He drives his chariot, there arose a night"
6993,THE BATTLE,"Dark with huge slaughter and with crime, and groans"
6994,THE BATTLE,"As of a voice immense, and sound of alms"
6995,THE BATTLE,"As fell the wearer, and of sword on sword"
6996,THE BATTLE,Crashed into fragments.  With a ready hand
6997,THE BATTLE,Caesar supplies the weapon and bids strike
6998,THE BATTLE,Full at the visage; and with lance reversed
6999,THE BATTLE,Urges the flagging ranks and stirs the fight.
7000,THE BATTLE,"Where flows the nation's blood, where beats the heart,"
7001,THE BATTLE,"Knowing, he bids them spare the common herd,"
7002,THE BATTLE,"But seek the senators -- thus Rome he strikes,"
7003,THE BATTLE,"Thus the last hold of Freedom.  In the fray,"
7004,THE BATTLE,Then fell the nobles with their mighty names
7005,THE BATTLE,"Of ancient prowess; there Metellus' sons,"
7006,THE BATTLE,"Corvini, Lepidi, Torquati too,"
7007,THE BATTLE,"Not once nor twice the conquerors of kings,"
7008,THE BATTLE,"First of all men, Pompeius' name except,"
7009,THE BATTLE,Lay dead upon the field.
7010,THE BATTLE,
7011,THE BATTLE,"But, Brutus, where,"
7012,THE BATTLE,"Where was thy sword? (23)  ""Veiled by a common helm"
7013,THE BATTLE,"Unknown thou wanderest.  Thy country's pride,"
7014,THE BATTLE,"Hope of the Senate, thou (for none besides);"
7015,THE BATTLE,"Thou latest scion of that race of pride,"
7016,THE BATTLE,"Whose fearless deeds the centuries record,"
7017,THE BATTLE,"Tempt not the battle, nor provoke the doom!"
7018,THE BATTLE,Awaits thee on Philippi's fated field
7019,THE BATTLE,Thy Thessaly.  Not here shalt thou prevail
7020,THE BATTLE,'Gainst Caesar's life.  Not yet hath he surpassed
7021,THE BATTLE,The height of power and deserved a death
7022,THE BATTLE,"Noble at Brutus' hands -- then let him live,"
7023,THE BATTLE,Thy fated victim!
7024,THE BATTLE,
7025,THE BATTLE,There upon the field
7026,THE BATTLE,Lay all the honour of Rome; no common stream
7027,THE BATTLE,Mixed with the purple tide.  And yet of all
7028,THE BATTLE,"Who noble fell, one only now I sing,"
7029,THE BATTLE,"Thee, brave Domitius. (24)  Whene'er the day"
7030,THE BATTLE,Was adverse to the fortunes of thy chief
7031,THE BATTLE,Thine was the arm which vainly stayed the fight.
7032,THE BATTLE,"Vanquished so oft by Caesar, now 'twas thine"
7033,THE BATTLE,Yet free to perish.  By a thousand wounds
7034,THE BATTLE,"Came welcome death, nor had thy conqueror power"
7035,THE BATTLE,Again to pardon.  Caesar stood and saw
7036,THE BATTLE,"The dark blood welling forth and death at hand,"
7037,THE BATTLE,"And thus in words of scorn: ""And dost thou lie,"
7038,THE BATTLE,"Domitius, there?  And did Pompeius name"
7039,THE BATTLE,"Thee his successor, thee?  Why leavest thou then"
7040,THE BATTLE,"His standards helpless?""  But the parting life"
7041,THE BATTLE,"Still faintly throbbed within Domitius' breast,"
7042,THE BATTLE,"Thus finding utterance: ""Yet thou hast not won"
7043,THE BATTLE,"Thy hateful prize, for doubtful are the fates;"
7044,THE BATTLE,"Nor thou the master, Caesar; free as yet,"
7045,THE BATTLE,"With great Pompeius for my leader still,"
7046,THE BATTLE,"Warring no more, I seek the silent shades,"
7047,THE BATTLE,"Yet with this hope in death, that thou subdued"
7048,THE BATTLE,To Magnus and to me in grievous guise
7049,THE BATTLE,"May'st pay atonement.""  So he spake: no more;"
7050,THE BATTLE,Then closed his eyes in death.
7051,THE BATTLE,
7052,THE BATTLE,"'Twere shame to shed,"
7053,THE BATTLE,"When thus a world was perishing, the tear"
7054,THE BATTLE,"Meet for each fate, or sing the wound that reft"
7055,THE BATTLE,Each life away.  Through forehead and through throat
7056,THE BATTLE,"The pitiless weapon clove its deadly path,"
7057,THE BATTLE,Or forced the entrails forth: one fell to earth
7058,THE BATTLE,Prone at the stroke; one stood though shorn of limb;
7059,THE BATTLE,Glanced from this breast unharmed the quivering spear;
7060,THE BATTLE,That it transfixed to earth.  Here from the veins
7061,THE BATTLE,"Spouted the life-blood, till the foeman's arms"
7062,THE BATTLE,"Were crimsoned.  One his brother slew, nor dared"
7063,THE BATTLE,"To spoil the corse, till severed from the neck"
7064,THE BATTLE,He flung the head afar.  Another dashed
7065,THE BATTLE,"Full in his father's teeth the fatal sword,"
7066,THE BATTLE,By murderous frenzy striving to disprove
7067,THE BATTLE,His kinship with the slain.  Yet for each death
7068,THE BATTLE,"We find no separate dirge, nor weep for men"
7069,THE BATTLE,"When peoples fell.  Thus, Rome, thy doom was wrought"
7070,THE BATTLE,"At dread Pharsalus.  Not, as in other fields,"
7071,THE BATTLE,"By soldiers slain, or captains; here were swept"
7072,THE BATTLE,"Whole nations to the death; Assyria here,"
7073,THE BATTLE,"Achaia, Pontus; and the blood of Rome"
7074,THE BATTLE,"Gushing in torrents forth, forbade the rest"
7075,THE BATTLE,"To stagnate on the plain.  Nor life was reft,"
7076,THE BATTLE,Nor safety only then; but reeled the world
7077,THE BATTLE,And all her manifold peoples at the blow
7078,THE BATTLE,In that day's battle dealt; nor only then
7079,THE BATTLE,"Felt, but in all the times that were to come."
7080,THE BATTLE,Those swords gave servitude to every age
7081,THE BATTLE,That shall be slavish; by our sires was shaped
7082,THE BATTLE,"For us our destiny, the despot yoke."
7083,THE BATTLE,"Yet have we trembled not, nor feared to bare"
7084,THE BATTLE,"Our throats to slaughter, nor to face the foe:"
7085,THE BATTLE,We bear the penalty for others' shame.
7086,THE BATTLE,"Such be our doom; yet, Fortune, sharing not"
7087,THE BATTLE,"In that last battle, 'twas our right to strike"
7088,THE BATTLE,One blow for freedom ere we served our lord.
7089,THE BATTLE,
7090,THE BATTLE,"Now saw Pompeius, grieving, that the gods"
7091,THE BATTLE,"Had left his side, and knew the fates of Rome"
7092,THE BATTLE,Passed from his governance; yet all the blood
7093,THE BATTLE,That filled the field scarce brought him to confess
7094,THE BATTLE,His fortunes fled.  A little hill he sought
7095,THE BATTLE,Whence to descry the battle raging still
7096,THE BATTLE,"Upon the plain, which when he nearer stood"
7097,THE BATTLE,The warring ranks concealed.  Thence did the chief
7098,THE BATTLE,Gaze on unnumbered swords that flashed in air
7099,THE BATTLE,And sought his ruin; and the tide of blood
7100,THE BATTLE,In which his host had perished.  Yet not as those
7101,THE BATTLE,"Who, prostrate fallen, would drag nations down"
7102,THE BATTLE,"To share their evil fate, Pompeius did."
7103,THE BATTLE,Still were the gods thought worthy of his prayers
7104,THE BATTLE,"To give him solace, in that after him"
7105,THE BATTLE,"Might live his Romans.  ""Spare, ye gods,"" he said,"
7106,THE BATTLE,"""Nor lay whole peoples low; my fall attained,"
7107,THE BATTLE,The world and Rome may stand. And if ye need
7108,THE BATTLE,"More bloodshed, here on me, my wife, and sons"
7109,THE BATTLE,Wreak out your vengeance -- pledges to the fates
7110,THE BATTLE,Such have we given.  Too little for the war
7111,THE BATTLE,"Is our destruction?  Doth the carnage fail,"
7112,THE BATTLE,"The world escaping?  Magnus' fortunes lost,"
7113,THE BATTLE,"Why doom all else beside him?""  Thus he cried,"
7114,THE BATTLE,"And passed amid his standards, and recalled"
7115,THE BATTLE,His vanquished host that rushed on fate declared.
7116,THE BATTLE,Not for his sake such carnage should be wrought.
7117,THE BATTLE,So thought Pompeius; nor the foeman's sword
7118,THE BATTLE,"He feared, nor death; but lest upon his fall"
7119,THE BATTLE,"To quit their chief his soldiers might refuse,"
7120,THE BATTLE,And o'er his prostrate corpse a world in arms
7121,THE BATTLE,Might find its ruin: or perchance he wished
7122,THE BATTLE,From Caesar's eager eyes to veil his death.
7123,THE BATTLE,"In vain, unhappy!  for the fates decree"
7124,THE BATTLE,"He shall behold, shorn from the bleeding trunk,"
7125,THE BATTLE,"Again thy visage.  And thou, too, his spouse,"
7126,THE BATTLE,"Beloved Cornelia, didst cause his flight;"
7127,THE BATTLE,Thy longed-for features; yet he shall not die
7128,THE BATTLE,When thou art present. (25)
7129,THE BATTLE,
7130,THE BATTLE,"Then upon his steed,"
7131,THE BATTLE,"Though fearing not the weapons at his back,"
7132,THE BATTLE,"Pompeius fled, his mighty soul prepared"
7133,THE BATTLE,"To meet his destinies.  No groan nor tear,"
7134,THE BATTLE,"But solemn grief as for the fates of Rome,"
7135,THE BATTLE,"Was in his visage, and with mien unchanged"
7136,THE BATTLE,"He saw Pharsalia's woes, above the frowns"
7137,THE BATTLE,Or smiles of Fortune; in triumphant days
7138,THE BATTLE,"And in his fall, her master.  The burden laid"
7139,THE BATTLE,"Of thine impending fate, thou partest free"
7140,THE BATTLE,To muse upon the happy days of yore.
7141,THE BATTLE,Hope now has fled; but in the fleeting past
7142,THE BATTLE,"How wast thou great!  Seek thou the wars no more,"
7143,THE BATTLE,And call the gods to witness that for thee
7144,THE BATTLE,Henceforth dies no man.  In the fights to come
7145,THE BATTLE,"On Afric's mournful shore, by Pharos' stream"
7146,THE BATTLE,And fateful Munda; in the final scene
7147,THE BATTLE,"Of dire Pharsalia's battle, not thy name"
7148,THE BATTLE,"Doth stir the war and urge the foeman's arm,"
7149,THE BATTLE,"But those great rivals biding with us yet,"
7150,THE BATTLE,Caesar and Liberty; and not for thee
7151,THE BATTLE,"But for itself the dying Senate fought,"
7152,THE BATTLE,When thou had'st fled the combat.
7153,THE BATTLE,
7154,THE BATTLE,Find'st thou not
7155,THE BATTLE,Some solace thus in parting from the fight
7156,THE BATTLE,Nor seeing all the horrors of its close?
7157,THE BATTLE,"Look back upon the dead that load the plain,"
7158,THE BATTLE,The rivers turbid with a crimson stream;
7159,THE BATTLE,Then pity thou thy victor.  How shall he
7160,THE BATTLE,"Enter the city, who on such a field"
7161,THE BATTLE,"Finds happiness?  Trust thou in Fortune yet,"
7162,THE BATTLE,"Her favourite ever; and whate'er, alone"
7163,THE BATTLE,"In lands unknown, an exile, be thy lot,"
7164,THE BATTLE,"Whate'er thy sufferings 'neath the Pharian king,"
7165,THE BATTLE,"'Twere worse to conquer.  Then forbid the tear,"
7166,THE BATTLE,"Cease, sounds of woe, and lamentation cease,"
7167,THE BATTLE,"And let the world adore thee in defeat,"
7168,THE BATTLE,"As in thy triumphs.  With unfaltering gaze,"
7169,THE BATTLE,"Look on the suppliant kings, thy subjects still;"
7170,THE BATTLE,"Search out the realms and cities which they hold,"
7171,THE BATTLE,"Thy gift, Pompeius; and a fitting place"
7172,THE BATTLE,Choose for thy death.
7173,THE BATTLE,
7174,THE BATTLE,"First witness of thy fall,"
7175,THE BATTLE,"And of thy noble bearing in defeat,"
7176,THE BATTLE,"Larissa.  Weeping, yet with gifts of price"
7177,THE BATTLE,"Fit for a victor, from her teeming gates"
7178,THE BATTLE,"Poured forth her citizens, their homes and fanes"
7179,THE BATTLE,Flung open; wishing it had been their lot
7180,THE BATTLE,With thee to share disaster.  Of thy name
7181,THE BATTLE,"Still much survives, unto thy former self"
7182,THE BATTLE,"Alone inferior, still could'st thou to arms"
7183,THE BATTLE,All nations call and challenge fate again.
7184,THE BATTLE,"But thus he spake: ""To cities nor to men"
7185,THE BATTLE,Avails the conquered aught; then pledge your faith
7186,THE BATTLE,"To him who has the victory.""  Caesar trod"
7187,THE BATTLE,"Pharsalia's slaughter, while his daughter's spouse"
7188,THE BATTLE,Thus gave him kingdoms; but Pompeius fled
7189,THE BATTLE,'Mid sobs and groans and blaming of the gods
7190,THE BATTLE,For this their fierce commandment; and he fled
7191,THE BATTLE,Full of the fruits and knowledge of the love
7192,THE BATTLE,"The peoples bore him, which he knew not his"
7193,THE BATTLE,In times of happiness.
7194,THE BATTLE,
7195,THE BATTLE,When Italian blood
7196,THE BATTLE,"Flowed deep enough upon the fatal field,"
7197,THE BATTLE,"Caesar bade halt, and gave their lives to those"
7198,THE BATTLE,Whose death had been no gain.  But that their camp
7199,THE BATTLE,"Might not recall the foe, nor calm of night"
7200,THE BATTLE,"Banish their fears, he bids his cohorts dash,"
7201,THE BATTLE,"While Fortune glowed and terror filled the plain,"
7202,THE BATTLE,Straight on the ramparts of the conquered foe.
7203,THE BATTLE,Light was the task to urge them to the spoil;
7204,THE BATTLE,"""Soldiers,"" he said, ""the victory is ours,"
7205,THE BATTLE,Full and triumphant: there doth lie the prize
7206,THE BATTLE,"Which you have won, not Caesar; at your feet"
7207,THE BATTLE,Behold the booty of the hostile camp.
7208,THE BATTLE,"Snatched from Hesperian nations ruddy gold,"
7209,THE BATTLE,"And all the riches of the Orient world,"
7210,THE BATTLE,Are piled within the tents.  The wealth of kings
7211,THE BATTLE,And of Pompeius here awaits its lords.
7212,THE BATTLE,"Haste, soldiers, and outstrip the flying foe;"
7213,THE BATTLE,E'en now the vanquished of Pharsalia's field
7214,THE BATTLE,"Anticipate your spoils.""  No more he said,"
7215,THE BATTLE,"But drave them, blind with frenzy for the gold,"
7216,THE BATTLE,"To spurn the bodies of their fallen sires,"
7217,THE BATTLE,And trample chiefs in dashing on their prey.
7218,THE BATTLE,What rampart had restrained them as they rushed
7219,THE BATTLE,To seize the prize for wickedness and war
7220,THE BATTLE,And learn the price of guilt?  And though they found
7221,THE BATTLE,In ponderous masses heaped for need of war
7222,THE BATTLE,"The trophies of a world, yet were their minds"
7223,THE BATTLE,"Unsatisfied, that asked for all.  Whate'er"
7224,THE BATTLE,"Iberian mines or Tagus bring to day,"
7225,THE BATTLE,Or Arimaspians from golden sands
7226,THE BATTLE,"May gather, had they seized; still had they thought"
7227,THE BATTLE,Their guilt too cheaply sold.  When pledged to them
7228,THE BATTLE,"Was the Tarpeian rock, for victory won,"
7229,THE BATTLE,"And all the spoils of Rome, by Caesar's word,"
7230,THE BATTLE,Shall camps suffice them?
7231,THE BATTLE,
7232,THE BATTLE,Then plebeian limbs
7233,THE BATTLE,"On senators' turf took rest, on kingly couch"
7234,THE BATTLE,The meanest soldier; and the murderer lay
7235,THE BATTLE,Where yesternight his brother or his sire.
7236,THE BATTLE,In raving dreams within their waking brains
7237,THE BATTLE,"Yet raged the battle, and the guilty hand"
7238,THE BATTLE,"Still wrought its deeds of blood, and restless sought"
7239,THE BATTLE,The absent sword-hilt.  Thou had'st said that groans
7240,THE BATTLE,"Issued from all the plain, that parted souls"
7241,THE BATTLE,"Had breathed a life into the guilty soil,"
7242,THE BATTLE,That earthly darkness teemed with gibbering ghosts
7243,THE BATTLE,And Stygian terrors.  Victory foully won
7244,THE BATTLE,Thus claimed its punishment.  The slumbering sense
7245,THE BATTLE,Already heard the hiss of vengeful flames
7246,THE BATTLE,As from the depths of Acheron.  One saw
7247,THE BATTLE,Deep in the trances of the night his sire
7248,THE BATTLE,And one his brother slain.  But all the dead
7249,THE BATTLE,In long array were visioned to the eyes
7250,THE BATTLE,Of Caesar dreaming.  Not in other guise
7251,THE BATTLE,Orestes saw the Furies ere he fled
7252,THE BATTLE,To purge his sin within the Scythian bounds;
7253,THE BATTLE,Nor in more fierce convulsions raged the soul
7254,THE BATTLE,Of Pentheus raving; nor Agave's (26) mind
7255,THE BATTLE,When she had known her son.  Before his gaze
7256,THE BATTLE,"Flashed all the javelins which Pharsalia saw,"
7257,THE BATTLE,Or that avenging day when drew their blades
7258,THE BATTLE,"The Roman senators; and on his couch,"
7259,THE BATTLE,Infernal monsters from the depths of hell
7260,THE BATTLE,Scourged him in slumber.  Thus his guilty mind
7261,THE BATTLE,Brought retribution.  Ere his rival died
7262,THE BATTLE,The terrors that enfold the Stygian stream
7263,THE BATTLE,"And black Avernus, and the ghostly slain"
7264,THE BATTLE,Broke on his sleep.
7265,THE BATTLE,
7266,THE BATTLE,Yet when the golden sun
7267,THE BATTLE,Unveiled the butchery of Pharsalia's field (27)
7268,THE BATTLE,"He shrank not from its horror, nor withdrew"
7269,THE BATTLE,His feasting gaze.  There rolled the streams in flood
7270,THE BATTLE,With crimson carnage; there a seething heap
7271,THE BATTLE,"Rose shrouding all the plain, now in decay"
7272,THE BATTLE,Slow settling down; there numbered he the host
7273,THE BATTLE,Of Magnus slain; and for the morn's repast
7274,THE BATTLE,"That spot he chose whence he might watch the dead,"
7275,THE BATTLE,And feast his eyes upon Emathia's field
7276,THE BATTLE,Concealed by corpses; of the bloody sight
7277,THE BATTLE,"Insatiate, he forbad the funeral pyre,"
7278,THE BATTLE,And cast Emathia in the face of heaven.
7279,THE BATTLE,"Nor by the Punic victor was he taught,"
7280,THE BATTLE,Who at the close of Cannae's fatal fight
7281,THE BATTLE,"Laid in the earth the Roman consul dead,"
7282,THE BATTLE,To find fit burial for his fallen foes;
7283,THE BATTLE,"For these were all his countrymen, nor yet"
7284,THE BATTLE,His ire by blood appeased.  Yet ask we not
7285,THE BATTLE,For separate pyres or sepulchres apart
7286,THE BATTLE,Wherein to lay the ashes of the fallen:
7287,THE BATTLE,Burn in one holocaust the nations slain;
7288,THE BATTLE,Or should it please thy soul to torture more
7289,THE BATTLE,"Thy kinsman, pile on high from Oeta's slopes"
7290,THE BATTLE,And Pindus' top the woods: thus shall he see
7291,THE BATTLE,While fugitive on the deep the blaze that marks
7292,THE BATTLE,Thessalia.  Yet by this idle rage
7293,THE BATTLE,Nought dost thou profit; for these corporal frames
7294,THE BATTLE,Bearing innate from birth the certain germs
7295,THE BATTLE,"Of dissolution, whether by decay"
7296,THE BATTLE,"Or fire consumed, shall fall into the lap"
7297,THE BATTLE,Of all-embracing nature.  Thus if now
7298,THE BATTLE,"Thou should'st deny the pyre, still in that flame"
7299,THE BATTLE,"When all shall crumble, (28) earth and rolling seas"
7300,THE BATTLE,"And stars commingled with the bones of men,"
7301,THE BATTLE,These too shall perish.  Where thy soul shall go
7302,THE BATTLE,These shall companion thee; no higher flight
7303,THE BATTLE,"In airy realms is thine, nor smoother couch"
7304,THE BATTLE,Beneath the Stygian darkness; for the dead
7305,THE BATTLE,"No fortune favours, and our Mother Earth"
7306,THE BATTLE,"All that is born from her receives again,"
7307,THE BATTLE,And he whose bones no tomb or urn protects
7308,THE BATTLE,Yet sleeps beneath the canopy of heaven.
7309,THE BATTLE,"And thou, proud conqueror, who would'st deny"
7310,THE BATTLE,"The rites of burial to thousands slain,"
7311,THE BATTLE,Why flee thy field of triumph?  Why desert
7312,THE BATTLE,"This reeking plain?  Drink, Caesar, of the streams,"
7313,THE BATTLE,"Drink if thou can'st, and should it be thy wish"
7314,THE BATTLE,Breathe the Thessalian air; but from thy grasp
7315,THE BATTLE,"The earth is ravished, and th' unburied host,"
7316,THE BATTLE,"Routing their victor, hold Pharsalia's field."
7317,THE BATTLE,
7318,THE BATTLE,Then to the ghastly harvest of the war
7319,THE BATTLE,Came all the beasts of earth whose facile sense
7320,THE BATTLE,Of odour tracks the bodies of the slain.
7321,THE BATTLE,Sped from his northern home the Thracian wolf;
7322,THE BATTLE,Bears left their dens and lions from afar
7323,THE BATTLE,Scenting the carnage; dogs obscene and foul
7324,THE BATTLE,Their homes deserted: all the air was full
7325,THE BATTLE,"Of gathering fowl, who in their flight had long"
7326,THE BATTLE,Pursued the armies.  Cranes (29) who yearly change
7327,THE BATTLE,"The frosts of Thracia for the banks of Nile,"
7328,THE BATTLE,This year delayed their voyage.  As ne'er before
7329,THE BATTLE,"The air grew dark with vultures' hovering wings,"
7330,THE BATTLE,"Innumerable, for every grove and wood"
7331,THE BATTLE,Sent forth its denizens; on every tree
7332,THE BATTLE,Dripped from their crimsoned beaks a gory dew.
7333,THE BATTLE,Oft on the conquerors and their impious arms
7334,THE BATTLE,"Or purple rain of blood, or mouldering flesh"
7335,THE BATTLE,Fell from the lofty heaven; or limbs of men
7336,THE BATTLE,From weary talons dropped.  Yet even so
7337,THE BATTLE,The peoples passed not all into the maw
7338,THE BATTLE,Of ravening beast or fowl; the inmost flesh
7339,THE BATTLE,"Scarce did they touch, nor limbs -- thus lay the dead"
7340,THE BATTLE,Scorned by the spoiler; and the Roman host
7341,THE BATTLE,"By sun and length of days, and rain from heaven,"
7342,THE BATTLE,At length was mingled with Emathia's plain.
7343,THE BATTLE,
7344,THE BATTLE,Ill-starred Thessalia!  By what hateful crime
7345,THE BATTLE,Didst thou offend that thus on thee alone
7346,THE BATTLE,Was laid such carnage?  By what length of years
7347,THE BATTLE,Shalt thou be cleansed from the curse of war?
7348,THE BATTLE,When shall the harvest of thy fields arise
7349,THE BATTLE,Free from their purple stain?  And when the share
7350,THE BATTLE,Cease to upturn the slaughtered hosts of Rome?
7351,THE BATTLE,"First shall the battle onset sound again,"
7352,THE BATTLE,Again shall flow upon thy fated earth
7353,THE BATTLE,A crimson torrent.  Thus may be o'erthrown
7354,THE BATTLE,"Our sires' memorials; those erected last,"
7355,THE BATTLE,Or those which pierced by ancient roots have spread
7356,THE BATTLE,Through broken stones their sacred urns abroad.
7357,THE BATTLE,Thus shall the ploughman of Haemonia gaze
7358,THE BATTLE,"On more abundant ashes, and the rake"
7359,THE BATTLE,"Pass o'er more frequent bones.  Wert, Thracia, thou."
7360,THE BATTLE,"Our only battlefield, no sailor's hand"
7361,THE BATTLE,Upon thy shore should make his cable fast;
7362,THE BATTLE,"No spade should turn, the husbandman should flee"
7363,THE BATTLE,"Thy fields, the resting-place of Roman dead;"
7364,THE BATTLE,"No lowing kine should graze, nor shepherd dare"
7365,THE BATTLE,To leave his fleecy charge to browse at will
7366,THE BATTLE,On fields made fertile by our mouldering dust;
7367,THE BATTLE,"All bare and unexplored thy soil should lie,"
7368,THE BATTLE,"As past man's footsteps, parched by cruel suns,"
7369,THE BATTLE,"Or palled by snows unmelting!  But, ye gods,"

7623,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thus expiate.  And, cruel Julia, thee,"
7624,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Who by this war hast vengeance on our vows,"
7625,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,From thine abode I call: atonement find
7626,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"In this thy rival's death, and spare at least"
7627,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thy Magnus.""  Then upon his breast she fell,"
7628,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"While all the concourse wept -- e'en Magnus' self,"
7629,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Who saw Thessalia's field without a tear.
7630,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
7631,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,But now upon the shore a numerous band
7632,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,From Mitylene thus approached the chief:
7633,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"""If 'tis our greatest glory to have kept"
7634,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The pledge with us by such a husband placed,"
7635,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Do thou one night within these friendly walls
7636,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"We pray thee, stay; thus honouring the homes"
7637,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Long since devoted, Magnus, to thy cause."
7638,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,This spot in days to come the guest from Rome
7639,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,For thee shall honour.  Nowhere shalt thou find
7640,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,A surer refuge in defeat.  All else
7641,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,May court the victor's favour; we long since
7642,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Have earned his chastisement.  And though our isle
7643,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Rides on the deep, girt by the ocean wave,"
7644,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"No ships has Caesar: and to us shall come,"
7645,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Be sure, thy captains, to our trusted shore,"
7646,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The war renewing.  Take, for all is thine,"
7647,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The treasures of our temples and the gold,"
7648,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Take all our youth by land or on the sea
7649,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To do thy bidding: Lesbos only asks
7650,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"This from the chief who sought her in his pride,"
7651,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Not in his fall to leave her.""  Pleased in soul"
7652,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"At such a love, and joyed that in the world"
7653,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Some faith still lingered, thus Pompeius said:"
7654,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"""Earth has for me no dearer land than this."
7655,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Did I not trust it with so sweet a pledge
7656,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And find it faithful?  Here was Rome for me,"
7657,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Country and household gods.  This shore I sought
7658,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Home of my wife, this Lesbos, which for her"
7659,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Had merited remorseless Caesar's ire:
7660,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor was afraid to trust you with the means
7661,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To gain his mercy.  But enough -- through me
7662,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Your guilt was caused -- I part, throughout the world"
7663,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To prove my fate.  Farewell thou happiest land!
7664,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Famous for ever, whether taught by thee"
7665,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Some other kings and peoples may be pleased
7666,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To give me shelter; or should'st thou alone
7667,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Be faithful.  And now seek I in what lands
7668,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Right may be found or wrong.  My latest prayer
7669,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Receive, O deity, if still with me"
7670,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thou bidest, thus.  May it be mine again,"
7671,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Conquered, with hostile Caesar on my tracks"
7672,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To find a Lesbos where to enter in
7673,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And whence to part, unhindered."""
7674,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
7675,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,In the boat
7676,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,He placed his spouse: while from the shore arose
7677,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Such lamentation, and such hands were raised"
7678,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"In ire against the gods, that thou had'st deemed"
7679,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"All left their kin for exile, and their homes."
7680,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And though for Magnus grieving in his fall
7681,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Yet for Cornelia chiefly did they mourn
7682,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Long since their gentle guest.  For her had wept
7683,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The Lesbian matrons had she left to join
7684,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"A victor husband: for she won their love,"
7685,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"By kindly modesty and gracious mien,"
7686,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Ere yet her lord was conquered, while as yet"
7687,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Their fortunes stood.
7688,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
7689,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Now slowly to the deep
7690,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Sank fiery Titan; but not yet to those
7691,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"He sought (if such there be), was shown his orb,"
7692,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Though veiled from those he quitted.  Magnus' mind,"
7693,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Anxious with waking cares, sought through the kings"
7694,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"His subjects, and the cities leagued with Rome"
7695,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"In faith, and through the pathless tracts that lie"
7696,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Beyond the southern bounds: until the toil
7697,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Of sorrowing thought upon the past, and dread"
7698,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Of that which might be, made him cast afar"
7699,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"His wavering doubts, and from the captain seek"
7700,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Some counsel on the heavens; how by the sky
7701,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,He marked his track upon the deep; what star
7702,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Guided the path to Syria, and what points"
7703,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Found in the Wain would pilot him aright
7704,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To shores of Libya.  But thus replied
7705,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The well-skilled watcher of the silent skies:
7706,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"""Not by the constellations moving ever"
7707,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Across the heavens do we guide our barks;
7708,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,For that were perilous; but by that star (2)
7709,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Which never sinks nor dips below the wave,"
7710,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Girt by the glittering groups men call the Bears.
7711,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"When stands the pole-star clear before the mast,"
7712,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Then to the Bosphorus look we, and the main"
7713,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Which carves the coast of Scythia.  But the more

7716,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Towards Syria tends, till bright Canopus (3) shines,"
7717,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,In southern skies content to hold his course;
7718,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,With him upon the left past Pharos borne
7719,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Straight for the Syrtes shalt thou plough the deep.
7720,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,But whither now dost bid me shape the yards
7721,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And set the canvas?"""
7722,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
7723,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Magnus, doubting still;"
7724,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"""This only be thy care: from Thracia steer"
7725,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The vessel onward; shun with all thy skill
7726,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Italia's distant shore: and for the rest

7728,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Pledged with the Lesbians, my spouse beloved,"
7729,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"My course was sure: now, Fortune, where thou wilt"
7730,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Give me a refuge.""  These his answering words."
7731,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
7732,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The pilot, as they hung from level yards"
7733,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Shifted the sails; and hauling to the stern
7734,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"One sheet, he slacked the other, to the left"
7735,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Steering, where Samian rocks and Chian marred"
7736,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The stillness of the waters; while the sea
7737,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Sent up in answer to the changing keel

7739,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Curbing his steeds, his wain the Charioteer,"
7740,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"While glows his dexter wheel, and with the left"
7741,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"He almost touches, yet avoids the goal."
7742,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
7743,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Now Titan veiled the stars and showed the shore;
7744,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"When, following Magnus, came a scattered band"
7745,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Saved from the Thracian storm.  From Lesbos' port
7746,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"His son; (4) next, captains who preserved their faith;"

7963,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor do they dare a combat hand to hand;
7964,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"But as the winds may suffer, from afar"
7965,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,They draw their bows at venture.  Brave men love
7966,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The sword which, wielded by a stalwart arm,"
7967,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Drives home the blow and makes the battle sure.
7968,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Not such their weapons; and the first assault
7969,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Shall force the flying Mede with coward hand
7970,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And empty quiver from the field.  His faith
7971,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,In poisoned blades is placed; but trustest thou
7972,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Those who without such aid refuse the war?
7973,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"For such alliance wilt thou risk a death,"
7974,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,With all the world between thee and thy home?
7975,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Shall some barbarian earth or lowly grave
7976,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Enclose thee perishing?  E'en that were shame
7977,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,While Crassus seeks a sepulchre in vain.
7978,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thy lot is happy; death, unfeared by men,"
7979,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Is thy worst doom, Pompeius; but no death"
7980,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Awaits Cornelia -- such a fate for her
7981,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,This king shall not reserve; for know not we
7982,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The hateful secrets of barbarian love,"
7983,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Which, blind as that of beasts, the marriage bed"
7984,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Pollutes with wives unnumbered?  Nor the laws

7986,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,In ancient days the fable of the crime
7987,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"By tyrant Oedipus unwitting wrought,"
7988,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Brought hate upon his city; but how oft
7989,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Sits on the throne of Arsaces a prince
7990,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Of birth incestuous?  This gracious dame
7991,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Born of Metellus, noblest blood of Rome,"
7992,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Shall share the couch of the barbarian king
7993,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"With thousand others: yet in savage joy,"
7994,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Proud of her former husbands, he may grant"
7995,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Some larger share of favour; and the fates
7996,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,May seem to smile on Parthia; for the spouse
7997,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Of Crassus, captive, shall to him be brought"
7998,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,As spoil of former conquest.  If the wound
7999,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Dealt in that fell defeat in eastern lands

8004,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,That in the clash of conflict ye forgot
8005,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,For Crassus' slaughtered troops the vengeance due?
8006,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,First should united Rome upon the Mede
8007,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Have poured her captains, and the troops who guard"
8008,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The northern frontier from the Dacian hordes;
8009,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And all her legions should have left the Rhine
8010,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Free to the Teuton, till the Parthian dead"
8011,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Were piled in heaps upon the sands that hide
8012,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Our heroes slain; and haughty Babylon
8013,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Lay at her victor's feet.  To this foul peace
8014,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,We pray an end; and if Thessalia's day
8015,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Has closed our warfare, let the conqueror march"
8016,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Straight on our Parthian foe.  Then should this heart,"
8017,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Then only, leap at Caesar's triumph won."

8025,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Where passed their headless trunks: Euphrates here
8026,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Engulfed them slain, or Tigris' winding stream"
8027,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Cast on the shore to perish.  Gaze on this,"
8028,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And thou canst supplicate at Caesar's feet
8029,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"In mid Thessalia seated.  Nay, thy glance"
8030,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Turn on the Roman world, and if thou fear'st"
8031,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"King Juba faithless and the southern realms,"

8071,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,For counsel given; but in haste were met
8072,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"All who advised the base Pellaean king,"
8073,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Monsters, inhuman; there Achoreus sat"

8076,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Of fertilising Nile.  While he was priest
8077,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Not only once had Apis (17) lived the space
8078,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Marked by the crescent on his sacred brow.
8079,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"First was his voice, for Magnus raised and troth"
8080,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And for the pledges of the king deceased:

8095,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,At piety must flee the regal hall;
8096,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Virtue's the bane of rule; he lives in dread

8126,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,We have offence which by the sword alone
8127,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Can find its condonation, in that we"

8154,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,His slaves permit him to so great a deed
8155,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To give his favouring voice; and for the work
8156,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,They choose Achillas.
8157,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
8158,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Where the treacherous shore
8159,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Runs out in sand below the Casian mount

8166,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Its thoughts to such an enterprise?  Do thus
8167,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Our fates press on the world?  Is Rome thus fallen
8168,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,That in our civil frays the Phaxian sword
8169,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Finds place, or Egypt?  O, may civil war"
8170,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Be thus far faithful that the hand which strikes
8171,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Be of our kindred; and the foreign fiend
8172,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Held worlds apart!  Pompeius, great in soul,"
8173,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Noble in spirit, had deserved a death"
8174,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"From Caesar's self.  And, king, hast thou no fear"
8175,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,At such a ruin of so great a name?
8176,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And dost thou dare when heaven's high thunder rolls,"
8177,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thou, puny boy, to mingle with its tones"
8178,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Thine impure utterance?  Had he not won
8179,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"A world by arms, and thrice in triumph scaled"

8183,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"To cause forbearance in a Pharian king,"
8184,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,That he was Roman.  Wherefore with thy sword

8186,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,How stand thy fortunes; now no more by right
8187,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Hast thou the sceptre of the land of Nile;
8188,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"For prostrate, vanquished in the civil wars"

8199,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Eternal and unalterable laws
8200,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Called for their victim and decreed his end
8201,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Now near at hand, his comrades' warning voice"
8202,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Yet might have stayed his course: for if the court
8203,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"To Magnus, who bestowed the Pharian crown,"
8204,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"In truth were open, should not king and fleet"
8205,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,In pomp have come to greet him?  But he yields:
8206,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The fates compel.  Welcome to him was death
8207,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Rather than fear.  But, rushing to the side,"
8208,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"His spouse would follow, for she dared not stay,"
8209,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Fearing the guile.  Then he, ""Abide, my wife,"

8221,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Am I thy fit companion?""  Thus in vain,"
8222,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Leaning upon the bulwark, dazed with dread;"
8223,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Nor could she turn her straining gaze aside,"
8224,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor see her parting husband.  All the fleet
8225,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Stood silent, anxious, waiting for the end:"
8226,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Not that they feared the murder which befell,"

8236,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Fierce, brutal, thirsting as a beast may thirst"
8237,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"For carnage.  Didst thou, Fortune, for the sake"
8238,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Of nations, spare to dread Pharsalus field"
8239,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,This savage monster's blows?  Or dost thou place
8240,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Throughout the world, for thy mysterious ends,"
8241,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Some ministering swords for civil war?
8242,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thus, to the shame of victors and of gods,"
8243,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,This story shall be told in days to come:
8244,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"A Roman swordsman, once within thy ranks,"
8245,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Slave to the orders of a puny prince,"
8246,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Severed Pompeius' neck.  And what shall be
8247,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Septimius' fame hereafter?  By what name
8248,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"This deed be called, if Brutus wrought a crime?"
8249,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
8250,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Now came the end, the latest hour of all:"
8251,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Rapt to the boat was Magnus, of himself"

8254,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"He swathed his visage, for he scorned unveiled"
8255,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To yield his life to fortune; closed his eyes
8256,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And held his breath within him, lest some word,"
8257,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Or sob escaped, might mar the deathless fame"
8258,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,His deeds had won.  And when within his side
8259,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Achillas plunged his blade, nor sound nor cry"
8260,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"He gave, but calm consented to the blow"
8261,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And proved himself in dying; in his breast
8262,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"These thoughts revolving: ""In the years to come"
8263,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Men shall make mention of our Roman toils,"
8264,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Gaze on this boat, ponder the Pharian faith;"
8265,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And think upon thy fame and all the years
8266,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,While fortune smiled: but for the ills of life
8267,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"How thou could'st bear them, this men shall not know"
8268,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Save by thy death.  Then weigh thou not the shame
8269,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"That waits on thine undoing.  Whose strikes,"
8270,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The blow is Caesar's.  Men may tear this frame

8278,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Guarding his thoughts.
8279,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
8280,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,But now Cornelia filled
8281,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The air with lamentations at the sight;
8282,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"""O, husband, whom my wicked self hath slain!"
8283,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,That lonely isle apart thy bane hath been
8284,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And stayed thy coming.  Caesar to the Nile

8287,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Sent from the gods with power, for Caesar's ire,"
8288,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Or thine own sake, to slay, thou dost not know"

8294,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Followed my spouse afield nor feared the fates;
8295,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And in disaster, when the kings refused,"
8296,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Received and cherished him.  Did I deserve
8297,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Thus to be left of thee, and didst thou seek"
8298,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To spare me?  And when rushing on thine end
8299,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Was I to live?  Without the monarch's help

8319,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Of striking, fierce Septimius' murderous hand"
8320,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,(Thus making worse his crime) severed the folds
8321,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"That swathed the face, and seized the noble head"
8322,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And drooping neck ere yet was fled the life:
8323,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Then placed upon the bench; and with his blade
8324,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Slow at its hideous task, and blows unskilled"
8325,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Hacked through the flesh and brake the knotted bone:
8326,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,For yet man had not learned by swoop of sword
8327,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Deftly to lop the neck.  Achillas claimed
8328,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The gory head dissevered.  What!  shalt thou
8329,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"A Roman soldier, while thy blade yet reeks"
8330,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"From Magnus' slaughter, play the second part"
8331,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To this base varlet of the Pharian king?
8332,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor bear thyself the bleeding trophy home?

8334,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Might know the features of the hero slain,"
8335,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Seized by the locks, the dread of kings, which waved"
8336,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Upon his stately front, on Pharian pike"
8337,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,The head was lifted; while almost the life
8338,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Gave to the tongue its accents, and the eyes"
8339,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Were yet scarce glazed: that head at whose command
8340,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Was peace or war, that tongue whose eloquent tones"
8341,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Would move assemblies, and that noble brow"
8342,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,On which were showered the rewards of Rome.
8343,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor to the tyrant did the sight suffice
8344,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"To prove the murder done.  The perishing flesh,"
8345,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The tissues, and the brain he bids remove"
8346,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,By art nefarious: the shrivelled skin
8347,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Draws tight upon the bone; and poisonous juice
8348,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Gives to the face its lineaments in death.
8349,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
8350,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Last of thy race, thou base degenerate boy,"
8351,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"About to perish (20) soon, and yield the throne"

8359,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Too much it troubled thee to guard the corse
8360,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Unmutilated, for his kinsman's eye"
8361,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To witness!  Such the faith which Fortune kept
8362,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,With prosperous Pompeius to the end.
8363,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,'Twas not for him in evil days some ray
8364,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Of light to hope for.  Shattered from the height
8365,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Of power in one short moment to his death!
8366,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Years of unbroken victories balanced down
8367,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,By one day's carnage!  In his happy time
8368,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Heaven did not harass him, nor did she spare"
8369,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,In misery.  Long Fortune held the hand
8370,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"That dashed him down.  Now beaten by the sands,"
8371,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Torn upon rocks, the sport of ocean's waves"
8372,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Poured through its wounds, his headless carcase lies,"
8373,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Save by the lacerated trunk unknown.
8374,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
8375,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Yet ere the victor touched the Pharian sands
8376,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Some scanty rites to Magnus Fortune gave,"
8377,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Lest he should want all burial.  Pale with fear
8378,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Came Cordus, hasting from his hiding place;"
8379,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Quaestor, he joined Pompeius on thy shore,"
8380,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Idalian Cyprus, bringing in his train"
8381,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,A cloud of evils.  Through the darkening shades
8382,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Love for the dead compelled his trembling steps,"
8383,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Hard by the marin of the deep to search
8384,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And drag to land his master.  Through the clouds
8385,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"The moon shone sadly, and her rays were dim;"
8386,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,But by its hue upon the hoary main
8387,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,He knew the body.  In a fast embrace
8388,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"He holds it, wrestling with the greedy sea,"
8389,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And deftly watching for a refluent wave
8390,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Gains help to bring his burden to the land.
8391,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Then clinging to the loved remains, the wounds"
8392,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Washed with his tears, thus to the gods he speaks,"
8393,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"And misty stars obscure: ""Here, Fortune, lies"
8394,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Pompeius, thine: no costly incense rare"
8395,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Or pomp of funeral he dares to ask;

8398,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Of pious Romans bear him to the tomb,"
8399,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Their parent; while the forums shall resound
8400,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,With dirges; nor that triumphs won of yore
8401,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Be borne before him; nor for sorrowing hosts
8402,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,To cast their weapons forth.  Some little shell
8403,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"He begs as for the meanest, laid in which"
8404,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,His mutilated corse may reach the flame.
8405,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Grudge not his misery the pile of wood
8406,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Lit by this menial hand.  Is't not enough
8407,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,That his Cornelia with dishevelled hair
8408,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Weeps not beside him at his obsequies,"
8409,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor with a last embrace shall place the torch

8412,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,
8413,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Burning from afar

8415,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Deserted of his own, with none to guard:"
8416,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,And quickly drawing from beneath the limbs
8417,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Some glowing logs, ""Whoe'er thou art,"" he said"

8431,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"No pile above the corpse nor under lay,"
8432,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Nor was the fire beneath.  Then as he crouched
8433,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Beside the blaze, ""O, greatest chief,"" he cried,"
8434,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Majestic champion of Hesperia's name,"

8453,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Then did he cherish the enfeebled fire
8454,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Till Magnus' body mingled with its flames.
8455,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,But now the harbinger of coming dawn
8456,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,Had paled the constellations: he in fear

8458,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,"Madman, what punishment for such a crime,"
8459,DEATH OF POMPEIUS.,For which thy fame by rumour trumpet-tongued

8675,CATO,"Yet in those ashes on the Pharian shore,"
8676,CATO,"In that small heap of dust, was not confined"
8677,CATO,So great a shade; but from the limbs half burnt
8678,CATO,And narrow cell sprang forth (1) and sought the sky
8679,CATO,Where dwells the Thunderer.  Black the space of air
8680,CATO,Upreaching to the poles that bear on high
8681,CATO,The constellations in their nightly round;
8682,CATO,There 'twixt the orbit of the moon and earth
8683,CATO,"Abide those lofty spirits, half divine,"
8684,CATO,Who by their blameless lives and fire of soul
8685,CATO,Are fit to tolerate the pure expanse
8686,CATO,"That bounds the lower ether: there shall dwell,"
8687,CATO,"Where nor the monument encased in gold,"
8688,CATO,"Nor richest incense, shall suffice to bring"
8689,CATO,"The buried dead, in union with the spheres,"
8690,CATO,Pompeius' spirit.  When with heavenly light
8691,CATO,"His soul was filled, first on the wandering stars"
8692,CATO,And fixed orbs he bent his wondering gaze;
8693,CATO,Then saw what darkness veils our earthly day
8694,CATO,And scorned the insults heaped upon his corse.
8695,CATO,"Next o'er Emathian plains he winged his flight,"
8696,CATO,"And ruthless Caesar's standards, and the fleet"
8697,CATO,Tossed on the deep: in Brutus' blameless breast
8698,CATO,"Tarried awhile, and roused his angered soul"
8699,CATO,To reap the vengeance; last possessed the mind
8700,CATO,Of haughty Cato.
8701,CATO,
8702,CATO,He while yet the scales
8703,CATO,"Were poised and balanced, nor the war had given"
8704,CATO,"The world its master, hating both the chiefs,"
8705,CATO,Had followed Magnus for the Senate's cause
8706,CATO,And for his country: since Pharsalia's field
8707,CATO,"Ran red with carnage, now was all his heart"
8708,CATO,Bound to Pompeius.  Rome in him received
8709,CATO,Her guardian; a people's trembling limbs
8710,CATO,He cherished with new hope and weapons gave
8711,CATO,Back to the craven hands that cast them forth.
8712,CATO,Nor yet for empire did he wage the war
8713,CATO,Nor fearing slavery: nor in arms achieved
8714,CATO,"Aught for himself: freedom, since Magnus fell,"
8715,CATO,The aim of all his host.  And lest the foe
8716,CATO,In rapid course triumphant should collect
8717,CATO,"His scattered bands, he sought Corcyra's gulfs"
8718,CATO,"Concealed, and thence in ships unnumbered bore"
8719,CATO,The fragments of the ruin wrought in Thrace.
8720,CATO,Who in such mighty armament had thought
8721,CATO,A routed army sailed upon the main
8722,CATO,Thronging the sea with keels?  Round Malea's cape
8723,CATO,And Taenarus open to the shades below
8724,CATO,"And fair Cythera's isle, th' advancing fleet"
8725,CATO,"Sweeps o'er the yielding wave, by northern breeze"
8726,CATO,Borne past the Cretan shores.  But Phycus dared
8727,CATO,"Refuse her harbour, and th' avenging hand"
8728,CATO,Left her in ruins.  Thus with gentle airs
8729,CATO,They glide along the main and reach the shore
8730,CATO,From Palinurus (2) named; for not alone
8731,CATO,"On seas Italian, Pilot of the deep,"
8732,CATO,Hast thou thy monument; and Libya too
8733,CATO,Claims that her waters pleased thy soul of yore.
8734,CATO,Then in the distance on the main arose
8735,CATO,"The shining canvas of a stranger fleet,"
8736,CATO,Or friend or foe they knew not.  Yet they dread
8737,CATO,In every keel the presence of that chief
8738,CATO,Their fear-compelling conqueror.  But in truth
8739,CATO,"That navy tears and sorrow bore, and woes"
8740,CATO,To make e'en Cato weep.
8741,CATO,
8742,CATO,For when in vain
8743,CATO,Cornelia prayed her stepson and the crew
8744,CATO,"To stay their flight, lest haply from the shore"
8745,CATO,Back to the sea might float the headless corse;
8746,CATO,And when the flame arising marked the place
8747,CATO,"Of that unhallowed rite, ""Fortune, didst thou"
8748,CATO,"Judge me unfit,"" she cried, ""to light the pyre"
8749,CATO,"To cast myself upon the hero dead,"
8750,CATO,"The lock to sever, and compose the limbs"
8751,CATO,"Tossed by the cruel billows of the deep,"
8752,CATO,"To shed a flood of tears upon his wounds,"
8753,CATO,And from the flickering flame to bear away
8754,CATO,And place within the temples of the gods
8755,CATO,"All that I could, his dust?  That pyre bestows"
8756,CATO,"No honour, haply by some Pharian hand"
8757,CATO,Piled up in insult to his mighty shade.
8758,CATO,Happy the Crassi lying on the waste
8759,CATO,Unburied.  To the greater shame of heaven
8760,CATO,Pompeius has such funeral.  And shall this
8761,CATO,For ever be my lot?  her husbands slain
8762,CATO,"Cornelia ne'er enclose within the tomb,"
8763,CATO,Nor shed the tear beside the urn that holds
8764,CATO,The ashes of the loved?  Yet for my grief
8765,CATO,What boots or monument or ordered pomp?
8766,CATO,"Dost thou not, impious, upon thy heart"
8767,CATO,"Pompeius' image, and upon thy soul"
8768,CATO,Bear ineffaceable?  Dust closed in urns
8769,CATO,Is for the wife who would survive her lord
8770,CATO,"Not such as thee, Cornelia!  And yet"
8771,CATO,Yon scanty light that glimmers from afar
8772,CATO,"Upon the Pharian shore, somewhat of thee"
8773,CATO,"Recalls, Pompeius!  Now the flame sinks down"
8774,CATO,And smoke drifts up across the eastern sky
8775,CATO,"Bearing thine ashes, and the rising wind"
8776,CATO,Sighs hateful in the sail.  To me no more
8777,CATO,Dearer than this whatever land may yield
8778,CATO,"Pompeius' victory, nor the frequent car"
8779,CATO,That carried him in triumph to the hill;
8780,CATO,Gone is that happy husband from my thoughts;
8781,CATO,Here did I lose the hero whom I knew;
8782,CATO,Here let me stay; his presence shall endear
8783,CATO,The sands of Nile where fell the fatal blow.
8784,CATO,"Thou, Sextus, brave the chances of the war"
8785,CATO,And bear Pompeius' standard through the world.
8786,CATO,For thus thy father spake within mine ear:
8787,CATO,'When sounds my fatal hour let both my sons
8788,CATO,Urge on the war; nor let some Caesar find
8789,CATO,"Room for an empire, while shall live on earth"
8790,CATO,Still one in whom Pompeius' blood shall run.
8791,CATO,This your appointed task; all cities strong
8792,CATO,"In freedom of their own, all kingdoms urge"
8793,CATO,To join the combat; for Pompeius calls.
8794,CATO,Nor shall a chieftain of that famous name
8795,CATO,Ride on the seas and fail to find a fleet.
8796,CATO,Urged by his sire's unconquerable will
8797,CATO,"And mindful of his rights, mine heir shall rouse"
8798,CATO,"All nations to the conflict.  One alone,"
8799,CATO,(Should he contend for freedom) may ye serve;
8800,CATO,"Cato, none else!'  Thus have I kept the faith;"
8801,CATO,"Thy plot (3) prevailed upon me, and I lived"
8802,CATO,Thy mandate to discharge.  Now through the void
8803,CATO,"Of space, and shades of Hell, if such there be,"
8804,CATO,I follow; yet how distant be my doom
8805,CATO,I know not: first my spirit must endure
8806,CATO,"The punishment of life, which saw thine end"
8807,CATO,"And could survive it; sighs shall break my heart,"
8808,CATO,Tears shall dissolve it: sword nor noose I need
8809,CATO,"Nor headlong plunge. 'Twere shameful since thy death,"
8810,CATO,"Were aught but grief required to cause my own."""
8811,CATO,
8812,CATO,"She seeks the cabin, veiled, in funeral garb,"
8813,CATO,"In tears to find her solace, and to love"
8814,CATO,Grief in her husband's room; no prayers were hers
8815,CATO,"For life, as were the sailors'; nor their shout"
8816,CATO,"Roused by the height of peril, moved her soul,"
8817,CATO,"Nor angered waves: but sorrowing there she lay,"
8818,CATO,Resigned to death and welcoming the storm.
8819,CATO,
8820,CATO,First reached they Cyprus on the foamy brine;
8821,CATO,Then as the eastern breeze more gently held
8822,CATO,"The favouring deep, they touched the Libyan shore"
8823,CATO,Where stood the camp of Cato.  Sad as one
8824,CATO,"Who deep in fear presages ills to come,"
8825,CATO,Cnaeus beheld his brother and his band
8826,CATO,Of patriot comrades.  Swift into the wave
8827,CATO,"He leaps and cries,  ""Where, brother, is our sire?"
8828,CATO,"Still stands our country mistress of the world,"
8829,CATO,"Or are we fallen, Rome with Magnus' death"
8830,CATO,"Rapt to the shades?""  Thus he: but Sextus said"
8831,CATO,
8832,CATO,"""Oh happy thou who by report alone"
8833,CATO,Hear'st of the deed that chanced on yonder shore!
8834,CATO,"These eyes that saw, my brother, share the guilt."
8835,CATO,"Not Caesar wrought the murder of our sire,"
8836,CATO,Nor any captain worthy in the fray.
8837,CATO,He fell beneath the orders of a king
8838,CATO,"Shameful and base, while trusting to the gods"
8839,CATO,Who shield the guest; a king who in that land
8840,CATO,By his concession ruled: (this the reward
8841,CATO,For favours erst bestowed). Within my sight
8842,CATO,Pierced through with wounds our noble father fell:
8843,CATO,Yet deeming not the petty prince of Nile
8844,CATO,"So fell a deed would dare, to Egypt's strand"
8845,CATO,"I thought great Caesar come.  But worse than all,"
8846,CATO,Worse than the wounds which gaped upon his frame
8847,CATO,"Struck me with horror to the inmost heart,"
8848,CATO,"Our murdered father's head, shorn from the trunk"
8849,CATO,"And borne aloft on javelin; this sight,"
8850,CATO,"As rumour said, the cruel victor asked"
8851,CATO,"To feast his eyes, and prove the bloody deed."
8852,CATO,For whether ravenous birds and Pharian dogs
8853,CATO,"Have torn his corse asunder, or a fire"
8854,CATO,"Consumed it, which with stealthy flame arose"
8855,CATO,"Upon the shore, I know not.  For the parts"
8856,CATO,Devoured by destiny I only blame
8857,CATO,"The gods: I weep the part preserved by men."""
8858,CATO,
8859,CATO,Thus Sextus spake: and Cnaeus at the words
8860,CATO,Flamed into fury for his father's shame.
8861,CATO,"""Sailors, launch forth our navies, by your oars"
8862,CATO,Forced through the deep though wind and sea oppose:
8863,CATO,"Captains, lead on: for civil strife ne'er gave"
8864,CATO,So great a prize; to lay in earth the limbs
8865,CATO,"Of Magnus, and avenge him with the blood"
8866,CATO,Of that unmanly tyrant.  Shall I spare
8867,CATO,"Great Alexander's fort, nor sack the shrine"
8868,CATO,And plunge his body in the tideless marsh?
8869,CATO,"Nor drag Amasis from the Pyramids,"
8870,CATO,"And all their ancient Kings, to swim the Nile?"
8871,CATO,"Torn from his tomb, that god of all mankind"
8872,CATO,"Isis, unburied, shall avenge thy shade;"
8873,CATO,And veiled Osiris shall I hurl abroad
8874,CATO,In mutilated fragments; and the form
8875,CATO,Of sacred Apis; (4) and with these their gods
8876,CATO,"Shall light a furnace, that shall burn the head"
8877,CATO,They held in insult.  Thus their land shall pay
8878,CATO,The fullest penalty for the shameful deed.
8879,CATO,No husbandman shall live to till the fields
8880,CATO,Nor reap the benefit of brimming Nile.
8881,CATO,"Thou only, Father, gods and men alike"
8882,CATO,"Fallen and perished, shalt possess the land."""
8883,CATO,
8884,CATO,Such were the words he spake; and soon the fleet
8885,CATO,Had dared the angry deep: but Cato's voice
8886,CATO,"While praising, calmed the youthful chieftain's rage."
8887,CATO,
8888,CATO,"Meanwhile, when Magnus' fate was known, the air"
8889,CATO,Sounded with lamentations which the shore
8890,CATO,"Re-echoed; never through the ages past,"
8891,CATO,"By history recorded, was it known"
8892,CATO,That thus a people mourned their ruler's death.
8893,CATO,"Yet more when worn with tears, her pallid cheek"
8894,CATO,"Veiled by her loosened tresses, from the ship"
8895,CATO,"Cornelia came, they wept and beat the breast."
8896,CATO,"The friendly land once gained, her husband's garb,"
8897,CATO,"His arms and spoils, embroidered deep in gold,"
8898,CATO,Thrice worn of old upon the sacred hill (5)
8899,CATO,She placed upon the flame.  Such were for her
8900,CATO,The ashes of her spouse: and such the love
8901,CATO,"Which glowed in every heart, that soon the shore"
8902,CATO,Blazed with his obsequies.  Thus at winter-tide
8903,CATO,By frequent fires th' Apulian herdsman seeks
8904,CATO,To render to the fields their verdant growth;
8905,CATO,Till blaze Garganus' uplands and the meads
8906,CATO,"Of Vultur, and the pasture of the herds"
8907,CATO,By warm Matinum.
8908,CATO,
8909,CATO,Yet Pompeius' shade
8910,CATO,"Nought else so gratified, not all the blame"
8911,CATO,"The people dared to heap upon the gods,"
8912,CATO,"For him their hero slain, as these few words"
8913,CATO,From Cato's noble breast instinct with truth:
8914,CATO,"""Gone is a citizen who though no peer (6)"
8915,CATO,Of those who disciplined the state of yore
8916,CATO,"In due submission to the bounds of right,"
8917,CATO,Yet in this age irreverent of law
8918,CATO,"Has played a noble part.  Great was his power,"
8919,CATO,But freedom safe: when all the plebs was prone
8920,CATO,"To be his slaves, he chose the private gown;"
8921,CATO,"So that the Senate ruled the Roman state,"
8922,CATO,The Senate's ruler: nought by right of arms
8923,CATO,He e'er demanded: willing took he gifts
8924,CATO,Yet from a willing giver: wealth was his
8925,CATO,"Vast, yet the coffers of the State he filled"
8926,CATO,"Beyond his own.  He seized upon the sword,"
8927,CATO,Knew when to sheath it; war did he prefer
8928,CATO,"To arts of peace, yet armed loved peace the more."
8929,CATO,"Pleased took he power, pleased he laid it down:"
8930,CATO,"Chaste was his home and simple, by his wealth"
8931,CATO,Untarnished.  Mid the peoples great his name
8932,CATO,And venerated: to his native Rome
8933,CATO,He wrought much good.  True faith in liberty
8934,CATO,Long since with Marius and Sulla fled:
8935,CATO,Now when Pompeius has been reft away
8936,CATO,Its counterfeit has perished.  Now unshamed
8937,CATO,"Shall seize the despot on Imperial power,"
8938,CATO,Unshamed shall cringe the Senate.  Happy he
8939,CATO,Who with disaster found his latest breath
8940,CATO,And met the Pharian sword prepared to slay.
8941,CATO,"Life might have been his lot, in despot rule,"
8942,CATO,Prone at his kinsman's throne.  Best gift of all
8943,CATO,"The knowledge how to die; next, death compelled."
8944,CATO,If cruel Fortune doth reserve for me
8945,CATO,"An alien conqueror, may Juba be"
8946,CATO,As Ptolemaeus.  So he take my head
8947,CATO,"My body grace his triumph, if he will."""
8948,CATO,More than had Rome resounded with his praise
8949,CATO,Words such as these gave honour to the shade
8950,CATO,Of that most noble dead.
8951,CATO,
8952,CATO,Meanwhile the crowd
8953,CATO,"Weary of warfare, since Pompeius' fall,"
8954,CATO,"Broke into discord, as their ancient chief"
8955,CATO,Cilician called them to desert the camp.
8956,CATO,But Cato hailed them from the furthest beach:
8957,CATO,"""Untamed Cilician, is thy course now set"
8958,CATO,"For Ocean theft again; Pompeius gone,"
8959,CATO,"Once more a pirate?""  Thus he spake, and gazed"
8960,CATO,At all the stirring throng; but one whose mind
8961,CATO,"Was fixed on flight, thus answered,  ""Pardon, chief,"
8962,CATO,"'Twas love of Magnus, not of civil war,"
8963,CATO,That led us to the fight: his side was ours:
8964,CATO,"With him whom all the world preferred to peace,"
8965,CATO,Our cause is perished.  Let us seek our homes
8966,CATO,"Long since unseen, our children and our wives."
8967,CATO,If nor the rout nor dread Pharsalia's field
8968,CATO,"Nor yet Pompeius' death shall close the war,"
8969,CATO,Whence comes the end?  The vigour of a life
8970,CATO,For us is vanished: in our failing years
8971,CATO,Give us at least some pious hand to speed
8972,CATO,"The parting soul, and light the funeral pyre."
8973,CATO,Scarce even to its captains civil strife
8974,CATO,Concedes due burial.  Nor in our defeat
8975,CATO,Does Fortune threaten us with the savage yoke
8976,CATO,Of distant nations.  In the garb of Rome
8977,CATO,"And with her rights, I leave thee.  Who had been"
8978,CATO,"Second to Magnus living, he shall be"
8979,CATO,My first hereafter: to that sacred shade
8980,CATO,Be the prime honour.  Chance of war appoints
8981,CATO,My lord but not my leader.  Thee alone
8982,CATO,"I followed, Magnus; after thee the fates."
8983,CATO,"Nor hope we now for victory, nor wish;"
8984,CATO,For all our Thracian army is fled
8985,CATO,"In Caesar's victory, whose potent star"
8986,CATO,"Of fortune rules the world, and none but he"
8987,CATO,Has power to keep or save.  That civil war
8988,CATO,Which while Pompeius lived was loyalty
8989,CATO,Is impious now.  If in the public right
8990,CATO,"Thou, patriot Cato, find'st thy guide, we seek"
8991,CATO,"The standards of the Consul.""  Thus he spake"
8992,CATO,And with him leaped into the ship a throng
8993,CATO,Of eager comrades.
8994,CATO,
8995,CATO,"Then was Rome undone,"
8996,CATO,For all the shore was stirring with a crowd
8997,CATO,Athirst for slavery.  But burst these words
8998,CATO,"From Cato's blameless breast: ""Then with like vows"
8999,CATO,As Caesar's rival host ye too did seek
9000,CATO,"A lord and master!  not for Rome the fight,"
9001,CATO,But for Pompeius!  For that now no more
9002,CATO,"Ye fight for tyranny, but for yourselves,"
9003,CATO,"Not for some despot chief, ye live and die;"
9004,CATO,Since now 'tis safe to conquer and no lord
9005,CATO,"Shall rob you, victors, of a world subdued --"
9006,CATO,"Ye flee the war, and on your abject necks"
9007,CATO,Feel for the absent yoke; nor can endure
9008,CATO,Without a despot!  Yet to men the prize
9009,CATO,Were worth the danger.  Magnus might have used
9010,CATO,"To evil ends your blood; refuse ye now,"
9011,CATO,"With liberty so near, your country's call?"
9012,CATO,Now lives one tyrant only of the three;
9013,CATO,Thus far in favour of the laws have wrought
9014,CATO,The Pharian weapons and the Parthian bow;
9015,CATO,"Not you, degenerate!  Begone, and spurn"
9016,CATO,This gift of Ptolemaeus. (8)  Who would think
9017,CATO,Your hands were stained with blood?  The foe will deem
9018,CATO,That you upon that dread Thessalian day
9019,CATO,"First turned your backs.  Then flee in safety, flee!"
9020,CATO,By neither battle nor blockade subdued
9021,CATO,"Caesar shall give you life!  O slaves most base,"
9022,CATO,"Your former master slain, ye seek his heir!"
9023,CATO,Why doth it please you not yet more to earn
9024,CATO,Than life and pardon?  Bear across the sea
9025,CATO,"Metellus' daughter, Magnus' weeping spouse,"
9026,CATO,"And both his sons; outstrip the Pharian gift,"
9027,CATO,"Nor spare this head, which, laid before the feet"
9028,CATO,"Of that detested tyrant, shall deserve"
9029,CATO,"A full reward.  Thus, cowards, shall ye learn"
9030,CATO,In that ye followed me how great your gain.
9031,CATO,Quick to your task and purchase thus with blood
9032,CATO,Your claim on Caesar.  Dastardly is flight
9033,CATO,"Which crime commends not."""
9034,CATO,
9035,CATO,Cato thus recalled
9036,CATO,The parting vessels.  So when bees in swarm
9037,CATO,"Desert their waxen cells, forget the hive"
9038,CATO,"Ceasing to cling together, and with wings"
9039,CATO,"Untrammelled seek the air, nor slothful light"
9040,CATO,On thyme to taste its bitterness -- then rings
9041,CATO,The Phrygian gong -- at once they pause aloft
9042,CATO,Astonied; and with love of toil resumed
9043,CATO,Through all the flowers for their honey store
9044,CATO,"In ceaseless wanderings search; the shepherd joys,"
9045,CATO,Sure that th' Hyblaean mead for him has kept
9046,CATO,"His cottage store, the riches of his home."
9047,CATO,
9048,CATO,Now in the active conduct of the war
9049,CATO,"Were brought to discipline their minds, untaught"
9050,CATO,To bear repose; first on the sandy shore
9051,CATO,"Toiling they learned fatigue: then stormed thy walls,"
9052,CATO,"Cyrene; prizeless, for to Cato's mind"
9053,CATO,'Twas prize enough to conquer.  Juba next
9054,CATO,"He bids attack, though Nature on the path"
9055,CATO,Had placed the Syrtes; which his sturdy heart
9056,CATO,Aspired to conquer.  Either at the first
9057,CATO,When Nature gave the universe its form
9058,CATO,She left this region neither land nor sea;
9059,CATO,"Not wholly shrunk, so that it should receive"
9060,CATO,The ocean flood; nor firm enough to stand
9061,CATO,Against its buffets -- all the pathless coast
9062,CATO,Lies in uncertain shape; the land by earth
9063,CATO,Is parted from the deep; on sandy banks
9064,CATO,"The seas are broken, and from shoal to shoal"
9065,CATO,The waves advance to sound upon the shore.
9066,CATO,"Nature, in spite, thus left her work undone,"
9067,CATO,Unfashioned to men's use -- Or else of old
9068,CATO,"A foaming ocean filled the wide expanse,"
9069,CATO,But Titan feeding from the briny depths
9070,CATO,His burning fires (near to the zone of heat)
9071,CATO,Reduced the waters; and the sea still fights
9072,CATO,"With Phoebus' beams, which in the length of time"
9073,CATO,Drank deeper of its fountains.
9074,CATO,
9075,CATO,When the main
9076,CATO,"Struck by the oars gave passage to the fleet,"
9077,CATO,Black from the sky rushed down a southern gale
9078,CATO,"Upon his realm, and from the watery plain"
9079,CATO,"Drave back th' invading ships, and from the shoals"
9080,CATO,"Compelled the billows, and in middle sea"
9081,CATO,Raised up a bank.  Forth flew the bellying sails
9082,CATO,"Beyond the prows, despite the ropes that dared"
9083,CATO,Resist the tempest's fury; and for those
9084,CATO,"Who prescient housed their canvas to the storm,"
9085,CATO,Bare-masted they were driven from their course.
9086,CATO,Best was their lot who gained the open waves
9087,CATO,Of ocean; others lightened of their masts
9088,CATO,Shook off the tempest; but a sweeping tide
9089,CATO,"Hurried them southwards, victor of the gale."
9090,CATO,Some freed of shallows on a bank were forced
9091,CATO,"Which broke the deep: their ship in part was fast,"
9092,CATO,Part hanging on the sea; their fates in doubt.
9093,CATO,Fierce rage the waves till hems (9) them in the land;
9094,CATO,Nor Auster's force in frequent buffets spent
9095,CATO,Prevails upon the shore.  High from the main
9096,CATO,"By seas inviolate one bank of sand,"
9097,CATO,Far from the coast arose; there watched in vain
9098,CATO,"The storm-tossed mariners, their keel aground,"
9099,CATO,No shore descrying.  Thus in sea were lost
9100,CATO,"Some portion, but the major part by helm"
9101,CATO,"And rudder guided, and by pilots' hands"
9102,CATO,"Who knew the devious channels, safe at length"
9103,CATO,Floated the marsh of Triton loved (as saith
9104,CATO,"The fable) by that god, whose sounding shell (10)"
9105,CATO,"All seas and shores re-echo; and by her,"
9106,CATO,"Pallas, who springing from her father's head"
9107,CATO,"First lit on Libya, nearest land to heaven,"
9108,CATO,(As by its heat is proved); here on the brink
9109,CATO,"She stood, reflected in the placid wave"
9110,CATO,And called herself Tritonis.  Lethe's flood
9111,CATO,"Flows silent near, in fable from a source"
9112,CATO,"Infernal sprung, oblivion in his stream;"
9113,CATO,"Here, too, that garden of the Hesperids"
9114,CATO,"Where once the sleepless dragon held his watch,"
9115,CATO,Shorn of its leafy wealth.  Shame be on him
9116,CATO,Who calls upon the poet for the proof
9117,CATO,Of that which in the ancient days befell;
9118,CATO,But here were golden groves by yellow growth
9119,CATO,"Weighed down in richness, here a maiden band"
9120,CATO,"Were guardians; and a serpent, on whose eyes"
9121,CATO,"Sleep never fell, was coiled around the trees,"
9122,CATO,Whose branches bowed beneath their ruddy load.
9123,CATO,"But great Alcides stripped the bending boughs,"
9124,CATO,And bore their shining apples (thus his task
9125,CATO,Accomplished) to the court of Argos' king.
9126,CATO,
9127,CATO,"Driven on the Libyan realms, more fruitful here,"
9128,CATO,"Pompeius (11) stayed the fleet, nor further dared"
9129,CATO,In Garamantian waves.  But Cato's soul
9130,CATO,"Leaped in his breast, impatient of delay,"
9131,CATO,"To pass the Syrtes by a landward march,"
9132,CATO,"And trusting to their swords, 'gainst tribes unknown"
9133,CATO,To lead his legions.  And the storm which closed
9134,CATO,The main to navies gave them hope of rain;
9135,CATO,"Nor biting frosts they feared, in Libyan clime;"
9136,CATO,Nor suns too scorching in the falling year.
9137,CATO,
9138,CATO,"Thus ere they trod the deserts, Cato spake:"
9139,CATO,"""Ye men of Rome, who through mine arms alone"
9140,CATO,"Can find the death ye covet, and shall fall"
9141,CATO,"With pride unbroken should the fates command,"
9142,CATO,"Meet this your weighty task, your high emprise"
9143,CATO,With hearts resolved to conquer.  For we march
9144,CATO,"On sterile wastes, burnt regions of the world;"
9145,CATO,"Scarce are the wells, and Titan from the height"
9146,CATO,"Burns pitiless, unclouded; and the slime"
9147,CATO,Of poisonous serpents fouls the dusty earth.
9148,CATO,Yet shall men venture for the love of laws
9149,CATO,"And country perishing, upon the sands"
9150,CATO,Of trackless Libya; men who brave in soul
9151,CATO,"Rely not on the end, and in attempt"
9152,CATO,Will risk their all.  'Tis not in Cato's thoughts
9153,CATO,On this our enterprise to lead a band
9154,CATO,"Blind to the truth, unwitting of the risk."
9155,CATO,"Nay, give me comrades for the danger's sake,"
9156,CATO,Whom I shall see for honour and for Rome
9157,CATO,Bear up against the worst.  But whose needs
9158,CATO,"A pledge of safety, to whom life is sweet,"
9159,CATO,Let him by fairer journey seek his lord.
9160,CATO,First be my foot upon the sand; on me
9161,CATO,First strike the burning sun; across my path
9162,CATO,The serpent void his venom; by my fate
9163,CATO,Know ye your perils.  Let him only thirst
9164,CATO,Who sees me at the spring: who sees me seek
9165,CATO,"The shade, alone sink fainting in the heat;"
9166,CATO,Or whoso sees me ride before the ranks
9167,CATO,Plodding their weary march: such be the lot
9168,CATO,"Of each, who, toiling, finds in me a chief"
9169,CATO,"And not a comrade.  Snakes, thirst, burning sand"
9170,CATO,"The brave man welcomes, and the patient breast"
9171,CATO,Finds happiness in labour.  By its cost
9172,CATO,Courage is sweeter; and this Libyan land
9173,CATO,Such cloud of ills can furnish as might make
9174,CATO,"Men flee unshamed.""  'Twas thus that Cato spake,"
9175,CATO,Kindling the torch of valour and the love
9176,CATO,Of toil: then reckless of his fate he strode
9177,CATO,The desert path from which was no return:
9178,CATO,"And Libya ruled his destinies, to shut"
9179,CATO,His sacred name within a narrow tomb.
9180,CATO,
9181,CATO,"One-third of all the world, (12) if fame we trust,"
9182,CATO,Is Libya; yet by winds and sky she yields
9183,CATO,Some part to Europe; for the shores of Nile
9184,CATO,No more than Scythian Tanais are remote
9185,CATO,"From furthest Gades, where with bending coast,"
9186,CATO,"Yielding a place to Ocean, Europe parts"
9187,CATO,From Afric shores.  Yet falls the larger world
9188,CATO,To Asia only.  From the former two
9189,CATO,Issues the Western wind; but Asia's right
9190,CATO,Touches the Southern limits and her left
9191,CATO,The Northern tempest's home; and of the East
9192,CATO,She's mistress to the rising of the Sun.
9193,CATO,All that is fertile of the Afric lands
9194,CATO,"Lies to the west, but even here abound"
9195,CATO,"No wells of water: though the Northern wind,"
9196,CATO,"Infrequent, leaving us with skies serene,"
9197,CATO,Falls there in showers.  Not gold nor wealth of brass
9198,CATO,It yields the seeker: pure and unalloyed
9199,CATO,Down to its lowest depths is Libyan soil.
9200,CATO,Yet citron forests to Maurusian tribes
9201,CATO,"Were riches, had they known; but they, content,"
9202,CATO,"Lived 'neath the shady foliage, till gleamed"
9203,CATO,"The axe of Rome amid the virgin grove,"
9204,CATO,To bring from furthest limits of the world
9205,CATO,Our banquet tables and the fruit they bear. (13)
9206,CATO,But suns excessive and a scorching air
9207,CATO,Burn all the glebe beside the shifting sands:
9208,CATO,There die the harvests on the crumbling mould;
9209,CATO,"No root finds sustenance, nor kindly Jove"
9210,CATO,Makes rich the furrow nor matures the vine.
9211,CATO,Sleep binds all nature and the tract of sand
9212,CATO,"Lies ever fruitless, save that by the shore"
9213,CATO,The hardy Nasamon plucks a scanty grass.
9214,CATO,"Unclothed their race, and living on the woes"
9215,CATO,Worked by the cruel Syrtes on mankind;
9216,CATO,For spoilers are they of the luckless ships
9217,CATO,Cast on the shoals: and with the world by wrecks
9218,CATO,Their only commerce.
9219,CATO,
9220,CATO,Here at Cato's word
9221,CATO,"His soldiers passed, in fancy from the winds"
9222,CATO,That sweep the sea secure: here on them fell
9223,CATO,"Smiting with greater strength upon the shore,"
9224,CATO,"Than on the ocean, Auster's tempest force,"
9225,CATO,And yet more fraught with mischief: for no crags
9226,CATO,"Repelled his strength, nor lofty mountains tamed"
9227,CATO,"His furious onset, nor in sturdy woods"
9228,CATO,"He found a bar; but free from reining hand,"
9229,CATO,Raged at his will o'er the defenceless earth.
9230,CATO,Nor did he mingle dust and clouds of rain
9231,CATO,"In whirling circles, but the earth was swept"
9232,CATO,"And hung in air suspended, till amazed"
9233,CATO,The Nasamon saw his scanty field and home
9234,CATO,"Reft by the tempest, and the native huts"
9235,CATO,From roof to base were hurried on the blast.
9236,CATO,"Not higher, when some all-devouring flame"
9237,CATO,"Has seized upon its prey, in volumes dense"
9238,CATO,"Rolls up the smoke, and darkens all the air."
9239,CATO,Then with fresh might he fell upon the host
9240,CATO,"Of marching Romans, snatching from their feet"
9241,CATO,The sand they trod.  Had Auster been enclosed
9242,CATO,In some vast cavernous vault with solid walls
9243,CATO,"And mighty barriers, he had moved the world"
9244,CATO,Upon its ancient base and made the lands
9245,CATO,To tremble: but the facile Libyan soil
9246,CATO,"By not resisting stood, and blasts that whirled"
9247,CATO,The surface upwards left the depths unmoved.
9248,CATO,Helmet and shield and spear were torn away
9249,CATO,"By his most violent breath, and borne aloft"
9250,CATO,Through all the regions of the boundless sky;
9251,CATO,"Perchance a wonder in some distant land,"
9252,CATO,Where men may fear the weapons from the heaven
9253,CATO,"There falling, as the armour of the gods,"
9254,CATO,Nor deem them ravished from a soldier's arm.
9255,CATO,'Twas thus on Numa by the sacred fire
9256,CATO,Those shields descended which our chosen priests (14)
9257,CATO,Bear on their shoulders; from some warlike race
9258,CATO,"By tempest rapt, to be the prize of Rome."
9259,CATO,
9260,CATO,Fearing the storm prone fell the host to earth
9261,CATO,"Winding their garments tight, and with clenched hands"
9262,CATO,Gripping the earth: for not their weight alone
9263,CATO,Withstood the tempest which upon their frames
9264,CATO,"Piled mighty heaps, and their recumbent limbs"
9265,CATO,Buried in sand.  At length they struggling rose
9266,CATO,"Back to their feet, when lo!  around them stood,"
9267,CATO,"Forced by the storm, a growing bank of earth"
9268,CATO,Which held them motionless.  And from afar
9269,CATO,"Where walls lay prostrate, mighty stones were hurled,"
9270,CATO,Thus piling ills on ills in wondrous form:
9271,CATO,"No dwellings had they seen, yet at their feet"
9272,CATO,Beheld the ruins.  All the earth was hid
9273,CATO,"In vast envelopment, nor found they guide"
9274,CATO,"Save from the stars, which as in middle deep"
9275,CATO,Flamed o'er them wandering: yet some were hid
9276,CATO,Beneath the circle of the Libyan earth
9277,CATO,Which tending downwards hid the Northern sky.
9278,CATO,
9279,CATO,"When warmth dispersed the tempest-driven air,"
9280,CATO,"And rose upon the earth the flaming day,"
9281,CATO,"Bathed were their limbs in sweat, but parched and dry"
9282,CATO,Their gaping lips; when to a scanty spring
9283,CATO,"Far off beheld they came, whose meagre drops"
9284,CATO,All gathered in the hollow of a helm
9285,CATO,They offered to their chief.  Caked were their throats
9286,CATO,"With dust, and panting; and one little drop"
9287,CATO,"Had made him envied.  ""Wretch, and dost thou deem"
9288,CATO,"Me wanting in a brave man's heart?"" he cried,"
9289,CATO,"""Me only in this throng?  And have I seemed"
9290,CATO,"Tender, unfit to bear the morning heat?"
9291,CATO,"He who would quench his thirst 'mid such a host,"
9292,CATO,"Doth most deserve its pangs.""  Then in his wrath"
9293,CATO,"Dashed down the helmet, and the scanty spring,"
9294,CATO,"Thus by their leader spurned, sufficed for all."
9295,CATO,
9296,CATO,Now had they reached that temple which possess
9297,CATO,"Sole in all Libya, th' untutored tribes"
9298,CATO,Of Garamantians.  Here holds his seat
9299,CATO,"(So saith the story) a prophetic Jove,"
9300,CATO,"Wielding no thunderbolts, nor like to ours,"
9301,CATO,The Libyan Hammen of the curved horn.
9302,CATO,No wealth adorns his fane by Afric tribes
9303,CATO,"Bestowed, nor glittering hoard of Eastern gems."
9304,CATO,"Though rich Arabians, Ind and Ethiop"
9305,CATO,"Know him alone as Jove, still is he poor"
9306,CATO,Holding his shrine by riches undefiled
9307,CATO,"Through time, and god as of the olden days"
9308,CATO,Spurns all the wealth of Rome.  That here some god
9309,CATO,"Dwells, witnesses the only grove"
9310,CATO,That buds in Libya -- for that which grows
9311,CATO,Upon the arid dust which Leptis parts
9312,CATO,"From Berenice, knows no leaves; alone"
9313,CATO,Hammon uprears a wood; a fount the cause
9314,CATO,Which with its waters binds the crumbling soil.
9315,CATO,Yet shall the Sun when poised upon the height
9316,CATO,Strike through the foliage: hardly can the tree
9317,CATO,"Protect its trunk, and to a little space"
9318,CATO,His rays draw in the circle of the shade.
9319,CATO,Here have men found the spot where that high band
9320,CATO,Solstitial divides in middle sky (15)
9321,CATO,"The zodiac stars: not here oblique their course,"
9322,CATO,"Nor Scorpion rises straighter than the Bull,"
9323,CATO,"Nor to the Scales does Ram give back his hours,"
9324,CATO,Nor does Astraea bid the Fishes sink
9325,CATO,More slowly down: but watery Capricorn
9326,CATO,"Is equal with the Crab, and with the Twins"
9327,CATO,The Archer; neither does the Lion rise
9328,CATO,Above Aquarius.  But the race that dwells
9329,CATO,Beyond the fervour of the Libyan fires
9330,CATO,Sees to the South that shadow which with us
9331,CATO,Falls to the North: slow Cynosure sinks (16)
9332,CATO,"For them below the deep; and, dry with us,"
9333,CATO,"The Wagon plunges; far from either pole,"
9334,CATO,"No star they know that does not seek the main,"
9335,CATO,But all the constellations in their course
9336,CATO,Whirl to their vision through the middle sky.
9337,CATO,
9338,CATO,Before the doors the Eastern peoples stood
9339,CATO,Seeking from horned Jove to know their fates:
9340,CATO,"Yet to the Roman chief they yielded place,"
9341,CATO,Whose comrades prayed him to entreat the gods
9342,CATO,"Famed through the Libyan world, and judge the voice"
9343,CATO,Renowned from distant ages.  First of these
9344,CATO,"Was Labienus: (17) ""Chance,"" he said, ""to us"
9345,CATO,The voice and counsel of this mighty god
9346,CATO,Has offered as we march; from such a guide
9347,CATO,"To know the issues of the war, and learn"
9348,CATO,To track the Syrtes.  For to whom on earth
9349,CATO,"If not to blameless Cato, shall the gods"
9350,CATO,"Entrust their secrets?  Faithful thou at least,"
9351,CATO,Their follower through all thy life hast been;
9352,CATO,Now hast thou liberty to speak with Jove.
9353,CATO,"Ask impious Caesar's fates, and learn the laws"
9354,CATO,That wait our country in the future days:
9355,CATO,Whether the people shall be free to use
9356,CATO,"Their rights and customs, or the civil war"
9357,CATO,"For us is wasted.  To thy sacred breast,"
9358,CATO,"Lover of virtue, take the voice divine;"
9359,CATO,Demand what virtue is and guide thy steps
9360,CATO,"By heaven's high counsellor."""
9361,CATO,
9362,CATO,"But Cato, full"
9363,CATO,"Of godlike thoughts borne in his quiet breast,"
9364,CATO,"This answer uttered, worthy of the shrines:"
9365,CATO,"""What, Labienus, dost thou bid me ask?"
9366,CATO,Whether in arms and freedom I should wish
9367,CATO,"To perish, rather than endure a king?"
9368,CATO,Is longest life worth aught?  And doth its term
9369,CATO,Make difference?  Can violence to the good
9370,CATO,Do injury?  Do Fortune's threats avail
9371,CATO,Outweighed by virtue?  Doth it not suffice
9372,CATO,To aim at deeds of bravery?  Can fame
9373,CATO,Grow by achievement?  Nay!  No Hammen's voice
9374,CATO,Shall teach us this more surely than we know.
9375,CATO,Bound are we to the gods; no voice we need;
9376,CATO,"They live in all our acts, although the shrine"
9377,CATO,Be silent: at our birth and once for all
9378,CATO,What may be known the author of our being
9379,CATO,Revealed; nor Chose these thirsty sands to chaunt
9380,CATO,"To few his truth, whelmed in the dusty waste."
9381,CATO,"God has his dwelling in all things that be,"
9382,CATO,"In earth and air and sea and starry vault,"
9383,CATO,"In virtuous deeds; in all that thou can'st see,"
9384,CATO,"In all thy thoughts contained.  Why further, then,"
9385,CATO,Seek we our deities?  Let those who doubt
9386,CATO,"And halting, tremble for their coming fates,"
9387,CATO,"Go ask the oracles.  No mystic words,"
9388,CATO,"Make sure my heart, but surely-coming Death."
9389,CATO,"Coward alike and brave, we all must die."
9390,CATO,"Thus hath Jove spoken: seek to know no more."""
9391,CATO,
9392,CATO,"Thus Cato spake, and faithful to his creed"
9393,CATO,He parted from the temple of the god
9394,CATO,And left the oracle of Hammon dumb.
9395,CATO,
9396,CATO,"Bearing his javelin, as one of them"
9397,CATO,Before the troops he marched: no panting slave
9398,CATO,"With bending neck, no litter bore his form."
9399,CATO,"He bade them not, but showed them how to toil."
9400,CATO,"Spare in his sleep, the last to sip the spring"
9401,CATO,When at some rivulet to quench their thirst
9402,CATO,"The eager ranks pressed onward, he alone"
9403,CATO,Until the humblest follower might drink
9404,CATO,Stood motionless.  If for the truly good
9405,CATO,"Is fame, and virtue by the deed itself,"
9406,CATO,"Not by sucoessful issue, should be judged,"
9407,CATO,"Yield, famous ancestors!  Fortune, not worth"
9408,CATO,Gained you your glory.  But such name as his
9409,CATO,Who ever merited by successful war
9410,CATO,Or slaughtered peoples?  Rather would I lead
9411,CATO,With him his triumph through the pathless sands
9412,CATO,"And Libya's bounds, than in Pompeius' car"
9413,CATO,"Three times ascend the Capitol, (18) or break"
9414,CATO,The proud Jugurtha. (19)  Rome!  in him behold
9415,CATO,"His country's father, worthiest of thy vows;"
9416,CATO,"A name by which men shall not blush to swear,"
9417,CATO,"Whom, should'st thou break the fetters from thy neck,"
9418,CATO,Thou may'st in distant days decree divine.
9419,CATO,
9420,CATO,"Now was the heat more dense, and through that clime"
9421,CATO,Than which no further on the Southern side
9422,CATO,"The gods permit, they trod; and scarcer still"
9423,CATO,"The water, till in middle sands they found"
9424,CATO,One bounteous spring which clustered serpents held
9425,CATO,Though scaroe the space sufficed.  By thirsting snakes
9426,CATO,The fount was thronged and asps pressed on the marge.
9427,CATO,But when the chieftain saw that speedy fate
9428,CATO,"Was on the host, if they should leave the well"
9429,CATO,"Untasted, ""Vain,"" he cried, ""your fear of death."
9430,CATO,"Drink, nor delay: 'tis from the threatening tooth"
9431,CATO,"Men draw their deaths, and fatal from the fang"
9432,CATO,Issues the juice if mingled with the blood;
9433,CATO,"The cup is harmless.""  Then he sipped the fount,"
9434,CATO,"Still doubting, and in all the Libyan waste"
9435,CATO,There only was he first to touch the stream.
9436,CATO,
9437,CATO,Why fertile thus in death the pestilent air
9438,CATO,"Of Libya, what poison in her soil"
9439,CATO,"Her several nature mixed, my care to know"
9440,CATO,Has not availed: but from the days of old
9441,CATO,A fabled story has deceived the world.
9442,CATO,
9443,CATO,"Far on her limits, where the burning shore"
9444,CATO,Admits the ocean fervid from the sun
9445,CATO,"Plunged in its waters, lay Medusa's fields"
9446,CATO,"Untilled; nor forests shaded, nor the plough"
9447,CATO,"Furrowed the soil, which by its mistress' gaze"
9448,CATO,"Was hardened into stone: Phorcus, her sire."
9449,CATO,Malevolent nature from her body first
9450,CATO,Drew forth these noisome pests; first from her jaws
9451,CATO,Issued the sibilant rattle of serpent tongues;
9452,CATO,Clustered around her head the poisonous brood
9453,CATO,"Like to a woman's hair, wreathed on her neck"
9454,CATO,Which gloried in their touch; their glittering heads
9455,CATO,Advanced towards her; and her tresses kempt
9456,CATO,Dripped down with viper's venom.  This alone
9457,CATO,"Thou hast, accursed one, which men can see"
9458,CATO,Unharmed; for who upon that gaping mouth
9459,CATO,"Looked and could dread?  To whom who met her glance,"
9460,CATO,Was death permitted?  Fate delayed no more.
9461,CATO,But ere the victim feared had struck him down:
9462,CATO,"Perished the limbs while living, and the soul"
9463,CATO,Grew stiff and stark ere yet it fled the frame.
9464,CATO,"Men have been frenzied by the Furies' locks,"
9465,CATO,Not killed; and Cerberus at Orpheus' song
9466,CATO,"Ceased from his hissing, and Alcides saw"
9467,CATO,The Hydra ere he slew.  This monster born
9468,CATO,Brought horror with her birth upon her sire
9469,CATO,"Phorcus, in second order God of Waves,"
9470,CATO,"And upon Ceto and the Gorgon brood, (20)"
9471,CATO,Her sisters.  She could threat the sea and sky
9472,CATO,"With deadly calm unknown, and from the world"
9473,CATO,Bid cease the soil.  Borne down by instant weight
9474,CATO,"Fowls fell from air, and beasts were fixed in stone."
9475,CATO,Whole Ethiop tribes who tilled the neighbouring lands
9476,CATO,Rigid in marble stood.  The Gorgon sight
9477,CATO,No creature bore and even her serpents turned
9478,CATO,Back from her visage.  Atlas in his place
9479,CATO,"Beside the Western columns, by her look"
9480,CATO,Was turned to rocks; and when on snakes of old
9481,CATO,"Phlegraean giants stood and frighted heaven,"
9482,CATO,"She made them mountains, and the Gorgon head"
9483,CATO,Borne on Athena's bosom closed the war.
9484,CATO,"Here born of Danae and the golden shower,"
9485,CATO,"Floating on wings Parrhasian, by the god"
9486,CATO,"Arcadian given, author of the lyre"
9487,CATO,"And wrestling art, came Perseus, down from heaven"
9488,CATO,Swooping.  Cyllenian Harp (21) did he bear
9489,CATO,"Still crimson from another monster slain,"
9490,CATO,The guardian of the heifer loved by Jove.
9491,CATO,This to her winged brother Pallas lent
9492,CATO,Price of the monster's head: by her command
9493,CATO,Upon the limits of the Libyan land
9494,CATO,"He sought the rising sun, with flight averse,"
9495,CATO,Poised o'er Medusa's realm; a burnished shield
9496,CATO,"Of yellow brass upon his other arm,"
9497,CATO,"Her gift, he bore: in which she bade him see"
9498,CATO,The fatal face unscathed.  Nor yet in sleep
9499,CATO,"Lay all the monster, for such total rest"
9500,CATO,To her were death -- so fated: serpent locks
9501,CATO,"In vigilant watch, some reaching forth defend"
9502,CATO,"Her head, while others lay upon her face"
9503,CATO,And slumbering eyes.  Then hero Perseus shook
9504,CATO,Though turned averse; trembled his dexter hand:
9505,CATO,"But Pallas held, and the descending blade"
9506,CATO,Shore the broad neck whence sprang the viper brood.
9507,CATO,What visage bore the Gorgon as the steel
9508,CATO,Thus reft her life!  what poison from her throat
9509,CATO,Breathed!  from her eyes what venom of death distilled!
9510,CATO,"The goddess dared not look, and Perseus' face"
9511,CATO,"Had frozen, averse, had not Athena veiled"
9512,CATO,With coils of writhing snakes the features dead.
9513,CATO,Then with the Gorgon head the hero flew
9514,CATO,Uplifted on his wings and sought the sky.
9515,CATO,Shorter had been his voyage through the midst
9516,CATO,Of Europe's cities; but Athena bade
9517,CATO,To spare her peoples and their fruitful lands;
9518,CATO,For who when such an airy courser passed
9519,CATO,Had not looked up to heaven?  Western winds
9520,CATO,"Now sped his pinions, and he took his course"
9521,CATO,"O'er Libya's regions, from the stars and suns"
9522,CATO,Veiled by no culture.  Phoebus' nearer track
9523,CATO,"There burns the soil, and loftiest on the sky (22)"
9524,CATO,"There fails the night, to shade the wandering moon,"
9525,CATO,"If o'er forgetful of her course oblique,"
9526,CATO,"Straight through the stars, nor bending to the North"
9527,CATO,"Nor to the South, she hastens.  Yet that earth,"
9528,CATO,"In nothing fertile, void of fruitful yield,"
9529,CATO,"Drank in the poison of Medusa's blood,"
9530,CATO,"Dripping in dreadful dews upon the soil,"
9531,CATO,And in the crumbling sands by heat matured.
9532,CATO,
9533,CATO,First from the dust was raised a gory clot (23)
9534,CATO,"In guise of Asp, sleep-bringing, swollen of neck:"
9535,CATO,Full was the blood and thick the poison drop
9536,CATO,That were its making; in no other snake
9537,CATO,More copious held.  Greedy of warmth it seeks
9538,CATO,"No frozen world itself, nor haunts the sands"
9539,CATO,Beyond the Nile; yet has our thirst of gain
9540,CATO,"No shame nor limit, and this Libyan death,"
9541,CATO,This fatal pest we purchase for our own.
9542,CATO,"Haemorrhois huge spreads out his scaly coils,"
9543,CATO,Who suffers not his hapless victims' blood
9544,CATO,To stay within their veins.  Chersydros sprang
9545,CATO,"To life, to dwell within the doubtful marsh"
9546,CATO,Where land nor sea prevails.  A cloud of spray
9547,CATO,Marked fell Chelyder's track: and Cenchris rose
9548,CATO,"Straight gliding to his prey, his belly tinged"
9549,CATO,"With various spots unnumbered, more than those"
9550,CATO,Which paint the Theban (24) marble; horned snakes
9551,CATO,With spines contorted: like to torrid sand
9552,CATO,"Ammodytes, of hue invisible:"
9553,CATO,Sole of all serpents Scytale to shed
9554,CATO,In vernal frosts his slough; and thirsty Dipsas;
9555,CATO,Dread Amphisbaena with his double head
9556,CATO,Tapering; and Natrix who in bubbling fount
9557,CATO,Fuses his venom.  Greedy Prester swells
9558,CATO,"His foaming jaws; Pareas, head erect"
9559,CATO,Furrows with tail alone his sandy path;
9560,CATO,"Swift Jaculus there, and Seps (25) whose poisonous juice"
9561,CATO,Makes putrid flesh and frame: and there upreared
9562,CATO,"His regal head, and frighted from his track"
9563,CATO,"With sibilant terror all the subject swam,"
9564,CATO,"Baneful ere darts his poison, Basilisk (26)"
9565,CATO,In sands deserted king.  Ye serpents too
9566,CATO,Who in all other regions harmless glide
9567,CATO,"Adored as gods, and bright with golden scales,"
9568,CATO,In those hot wastes are deadly; poised in air
9569,CATO,"Whole herds of kine ye follow, and with coils"
9570,CATO,"Encircling close, crush in the mighty bull."
9571,CATO,"Nor does the elephant in his giant bulk,"
9572,CATO,"Nor aught, find safety; and ye need no fang"
9573,CATO,"Nor poison, to compel the fatal end."
9574,CATO,
9575,CATO,Amid these pests undaunted Cato urged
9576,CATO,His desert journey on.  His hardy troops
9577,CATO,"Beneath his eyes, pricked by a scanty wound,"
9578,CATO,In strangest forms of death unnumbered fall.
9579,CATO,"Tyrrhenian Aulus, bearer of a flag,"
9580,CATO,Trod on a Dipsas; quick with head reversed
9581,CATO,The serpent struck; no mark betrayed the tooth:
9582,CATO,"The aspect of the wound nor threatened death,"
9583,CATO,Nor any evil; but the poison germ
9584,CATO,In silence working as consuming fire
9585,CATO,"Absorbed the moisture of his inward frame,"
9586,CATO,Draining the natural juices that were spread
9587,CATO,Around his vitals; in his arid jaws
9588,CATO,Set flame upon his tongue: his wearied limbs
9589,CATO,"No sweat bedewed; dried up, the fount of tears"
9590,CATO,Fled from his eyelids.  Tortured by the fire
9591,CATO,"Nor Cato's sternness, nor of his sacred charge"
9592,CATO,The honour could withhold him; but he dared
9593,CATO,"To dash his standard down, and through the plains"
9594,CATO,"Raging, to seek for water that might slake"
9595,CATO,The fatal venom thirsting at his heart.
9596,CATO,"Plunge him in Tanais, in Rhone and Po,"
9597,CATO,"Pour on his burning tongue the flood of Nile,"
9598,CATO,Yet were the fire unquenched.  So fell the fang
9599,CATO,Of Dipsas in the torrid Libyan lands;
9600,CATO,In other climes less fatal.  Next he seeks
9601,CATO,"Amid the sands, all barren to the depths,"
9602,CATO,For moisture: then returning to the shoals
9603,CATO,Laps them with greed -- in vain -- the briny draught
9604,CATO,Scarce quenched the thirst it made.  Nor knowing yet
9605,CATO,"The poison in his frame, he steels himself"
9606,CATO,To rip his swollen veins and drink the gore.
9607,CATO,"Cato bids lift the standard, lest his troops"
9608,CATO,May find in thirst a pardon for the deed.
9609,CATO,
9610,CATO,But on Sabellus' yet more piteous death
9611,CATO,Their eyes were fastened.  Clinging to his skin
9612,CATO,"A Seps with curving tooth, of little size,"
9613,CATO,"He seized and tore away, and to the sands"
9614,CATO,Pierced with his javelin.  Small the serpent's bulk;
9615,CATO,None deals a death more horrible in form.
9616,CATO,For swift the flesh dissolving round the wound
9617,CATO,Bared the pale bone; swam all his limbs in blood;
9618,CATO,Wasted the tissue of his calves and knees:
9619,CATO,And all the muscles of his thighs were thawed
9620,CATO,"In black distilment, and file membrane sheath"
9621,CATO,"Parted, that bound his vitals, which abroad"
9622,CATO,Flowed upon earth: yet seemed it not that all
9623,CATO,"His frame was loosed, for by the venomous drop"
9624,CATO,Were all the bands that held his muscles drawn
9625,CATO,Down to a juice; the framework of his chest
9626,CATO,"Was bare, its cavity, and all the parts"
9627,CATO,"Hid by the organs of life, that make the man."
9628,CATO,So by unholy death there stood revealed
9629,CATO,"His inmost nature.  Head and stalwart arms,"
9630,CATO,"And neck and shoulders, from their solid mass"
9631,CATO,Melt in corruption.  Not more swiftly flows
9632,CATO,"Wax at the sun's command, nor snow compelled"
9633,CATO,By southern breezes.  Yet not all is said:
9634,CATO,For so to noxious humours fire consumes
9635,CATO,Our fleshly frame; but on the funeral pyre
9636,CATO,What bones have perished?  These dissolve no less
9637,CATO,"Than did the mouldered tissues, nor of death"
9638,CATO,Thus swift is left a trace.  Of Afric pests
9639,CATO,Thou bear'st the palm for hurtfulness: the life
9640,CATO,"They snatch away, thou only with the life"
9641,CATO,The clay that held it.
9642,CATO,
9643,CATO,"Lo!  a different fate,"
9644,CATO,Not this by melting!  for a Prester's fang
9645,CATO,"Nasidius struck, who erst in Marsian fields"
9646,CATO,Guided the ploughshare.  Burned upon his face
9647,CATO,"A redness as of flame: swollen the skin,"
9648,CATO,"His features hidden, swollen all his limbs"
9649,CATO,Till more than human: and his definite frame
9650,CATO,One tumour huge concealed.  A ghastly gore
9651,CATO,Is puffed from inwards as the virulent juice
9652,CATO,"Courses through all his body; which, thus grown,"
9653,CATO,His corselet holds not.  Not in caldron so
9654,CATO,Boils up to mountainous height the steaming wave;
9655,CATO,Nor in such bellying curves does canvas bend
9656,CATO,To Eastern tempests.  Now the ponderous bulk
9657,CATO,"Rejects the limbs, and as a shapeless trunk"
9658,CATO,"Burdens the earth: and there, to beasts and birds"
9659,CATO,"A fatal feast, his comrades left the corse"
9660,CATO,"Nor dared to place, yet swelling, in the tomb."
9661,CATO,
9662,CATO,But for their eyes the Libyan pests prepared
9663,CATO,"More dreadful sights.  On Tullus great in heart,"
9664,CATO,"And bound to Cato with admiring soul,"
9665,CATO,"A fierce Haemorrhois fixed.  From every limb, (27)"
9666,CATO,(As from a statue saffron spray is showered
9667,CATO,In every part) there spouted forth for blood
9668,CATO,A sable poison: from the natural pores
9669,CATO,"Of moisture, gore profuse; his mouth was filled"
9670,CATO,"And gaping nostrils, and his tears were blood."
9671,CATO,Brimmed full his veins; his very sweat was red;
9672,CATO,All was one wound.
9673,CATO,
9674,CATO,Then piteous Levus next
9675,CATO,"In sleep was victim, for around his heart"
9676,CATO,Stood still the blood congealed: no pain he felt
9677,CATO,"Of venomous tooth, but swift upon him fell"
9678,CATO,"Death, and he sought the shades; more swift to kill"
9679,CATO,No draught in poisonous cups from ripened plants
9680,CATO,Of direst growth Sabaean wizards brew.
9681,CATO,
9682,CATO,"Lo! Upon branchless trunk a serpent, named"
9683,CATO,"By Libyans Jaculus, rose in coils to dart"
9684,CATO,His venom from afar.  Through Paullus' brain
9685,CATO,"It rushed, nor stayed; for in the wound itself"
9686,CATO,"Was death.  Then did they know how slowly flies,"
9687,CATO,"Flung from a sling, the stone; how gently speed"
9688,CATO,Through air the shafts of Scythia.
9689,CATO,
9690,CATO,"What availed,"
9691,CATO,"Murrus, the lance by which thou didst transfix"
9692,CATO,A Basilisk?  Swift through the weapon ran
9693,CATO,The poison to his hand: he draws his sword
9694,CATO,And severs arm and shoulder at a blow:
9695,CATO,Then gazed secure upon his severed hand
9696,CATO,"Which perished as he looked.  So had'st thou died,"
9697,CATO,And such had been thy fate!
9698,CATO,
9699,CATO,Whoe'er had thought
9700,CATO,A scorpion had strength o'er death or fate?
9701,CATO,Yet with his threatening coils and barb erect
9702,CATO,He won the glory of Orion (28) slain;
9703,CATO,So bear the stars their witness.  And who would fear
9704,CATO,"Thy haunts, Salpuga? (29)  Yet the Stygian Maids"
9705,CATO,Have given thee power to snap the fatal threads.
9706,CATO,
9707,CATO,"Thus nor the day with brightness, nor the night"
9708,CATO,With darkness gave them peace.  The very earth
9709,CATO,On which they lay they feared; nor leaves nor straw
9710,CATO,"They piled for couches, but upon the ground"
9711,CATO,"Unshielded from the fates they laid their limbs,"
9712,CATO,Cherished beneath whose warmth in chill of night
9713,CATO,The frozen pests found shelter; in whose jaws
9714,CATO,"Harmless the while, the lurking venom slept."
9715,CATO,Nor did they know the measure of their march
9716,CATO,"Accomplished, nor their path; the stars in heaven"
9717,CATO,"Their only guide.  ""Return, ye gods,"" they cried,"
9718,CATO,"In frequent wail, ""the arms from which we fled."
9719,CATO,Give back Thessalia.  Sworn to meet the sword
9720,CATO,"Why, lingering, fall we thus?  In Caesar's place"
9721,CATO,The thirsty Dipsas and the horned snake
9722,CATO,Now wage the warfare.  Rather let us seek
9723,CATO,That region by the horses of the sun
9724,CATO,"Scorched, and the zone most torrid: let us fall"
9725,CATO,"Slain by some heavenly cause, and from the sky"
9726,CATO,"Descend our fate!  Not, Africa, of thee"
9727,CATO,"Complain we, nor of Nature.  From mankind"
9728,CATO,"Cut off, this quarter, teeming thus with pests"
9729,CATO,"She gave to snakes, and to the barren fields"
9730,CATO,"Denied the husbandman, nor wished that men"
9731,CATO,Should perish by their venom.  To the realms
9732,CATO,"Of serpents have we come.  Hater of men,"
9733,CATO,"Receive thy vengeance, whoso of the gods"
9734,CATO,"Severed this region upon either hand,"
9735,CATO,With death in middle space.  Our march is set
9736,CATO,"Through thy sequestered kingdom, and the host"
9737,CATO,Which knows thy secret seeks the furthest world.
9738,CATO,Perchance some greater wonders on our path
9739,CATO,May still await us; in the waves be plunged
9740,CATO,"Heaven's constellations, and the lofty pole"
9741,CATO,Stoop from its height.  By further space removed
9742,CATO,"No land, than Juba's realm; by rumour's voice"
9743,CATO,"Drear, mournful.  Haply for this serpent land"
9744,CATO,"There may we long, where yet some living thing"
9745,CATO,Gives consolation.  Not my native land
9746,CATO,Nor European fields I hope for now
9747,CATO,"Lit by far other suns, nor Asia's plains."
9748,CATO,"But in what land, what region of the sky,"
9749,CATO,Where left we Africa?  But now with frosts
9750,CATO,Cyrene stiffened: have we changed the laws
9751,CATO,"Which rule the seasons, in this little space?"
9752,CATO,"Cast from the world we know, 'neath other skies"
9753,CATO,And stars we tread; behind our backs the home
9754,CATO,Of southern tempests: Rome herself perchance
9755,CATO,Now lies beneath our feet.  Yet for our fates
9756,CATO,"This solace pray we, that on this our track"
9757,CATO,"Pursuing Caesar with his host may come."""
9758,CATO,
9759,CATO,Thus was their stubborn patience of its plaints
9760,CATO,Disburdened.  But the bravery of their chief
9761,CATO,"Forced them to bear their toils.  Upon the sand,"
9762,CATO,"All bare, he lies and dares at every hour"
9763,CATO,Fortune to strike: he only at the fate
9764,CATO,"Of each is present, flies to every call;"
9765,CATO,"And greatest boon of all, greater than life,"
9766,CATO,Brought strength to die.  To groan in death was shame
9767,CATO,In such a presence.  What power had all the ills
9768,CATO,Possessed upon him?  In another's breast
9769,CATO,"He conquers misery, teaching by his mien"
9770,CATO,That pain is powerless.
9771,CATO,
9772,CATO,Hardly aid at length
9773,CATO,"Did Fortune, wearied of their perils, grant."
9774,CATO,"Alone unharmed of all who till the earth,"
9775,CATO,"By deadly serpents, dwells the Psyllian race."
9776,CATO,"Potent as herbs their song; safe is their blood,"
9777,CATO,Nor gives admission to the poison germ
9778,CATO,E'en when the chant has ceased.  Their home itself
9779,CATO,Placed in such venomous tract and serpent-thronged
9780,CATO,"Gained them this vantage, and a truce with death,"
9781,CATO,Else could they not have lived.  Such is their trust
9782,CATO,"In purity of blood, that newly born"
9783,CATO,Each babe they prove by test of deadly asp
9784,CATO,For foreign lineage.  So the bird of Jove
9785,CATO,Turns his new fledglings to the rising sun
9786,CATO,And such as gaze upon the beams of day
9787,CATO,"With eves unwavering, for the use of heaven"
9788,CATO,He rears; but such as blink at Phoebus' rays
9789,CATO,Casts from the nest.  Thus of unmixed descent
9790,CATO,"The babe who, dreading not the serpent touch,"
9791,CATO,Plays in his cradle with the deadly snake.
9792,CATO,Nor with their own immunity from harm
9793,CATO,"Contented do they rest, but watch for guests"
9794,CATO,Who need their help against the noisome plague.
9795,CATO,
9796,CATO,"Now to the Roman standards are they come,"
9797,CATO,"And when the chieftain bade the tents be fixed,"
9798,CATO,First all the sandy space within the lines
9799,CATO,With song they purify and magic words
9800,CATO,From which all serpents flee: next round the camp
9801,CATO,In widest circuit from a kindled fire
9802,CATO,"Rise aromatic odours: danewort burns,"
9803,CATO,And juice distils from Syrian galbanum;
9804,CATO,"Then tamarisk and costum, Eastern herbs,"
9805,CATO,Strong panacea mixt with centaury
9806,CATO,"From Thrace, and leaves of fennel feed the flames,"
9807,CATO,And thapsus brought from Eryx: and they burn
9808,CATO,"Larch, southern-wood and antlers of a deer"
9809,CATO,"Which lived afar.  From these in densest fumes,"
9810,CATO,"Deadly to snakes, a pungent smoke arose;"
9811,CATO,And thus in safety passed the night away.
9812,CATO,But should some victim feel the fatal fang
9813,CATO,"Upon the march, then of this magic race"
9814,CATO,"Were seen the wonders, for a mighty strife"
9815,CATO,Rose 'twixt the Psyllian and the poison germ.
9816,CATO,First with saliva they anoint the limbs
9817,CATO,That held the venomous juice within the wound;
9818,CATO,Nor suffer it to spread.  From foaming mouth
9819,CATO,Next with continuous cadence would they pour
9820,CATO,Unceasing chants -- nor breathing space nor pause --
9821,CATO,Else spreads the poison: nor does fate permit
9822,CATO,A moment's silence.  Oft from the black flesh
9823,CATO,Flies forth the pest beneath the magic song:
9824,CATO,"But should it linger nor obey the voice,"
9825,CATO,"Repugmant to the summons, on the wound"
9826,CATO,Prostrate they lay their lips and from the depths
9827,CATO,"Now paling draw the venom.  In their mouths,"
9828,CATO,"Sucked from the freezing flesh, they hold the death,"
9829,CATO,Then spew it forth; and from the taste shall know
9830,CATO,The snake they conquer.
9831,CATO,
9832,CATO,Aided thus at length
9833,CATO,Wanders the Roman host in better guise
9834,CATO,Upon the barren fields in lengthy march. (30)
9835,CATO,Twice veiled the moon her light and twice renewed;
9836,CATO,"Yet still, with waning or with growing orb"
9837,CATO,Saw Cato's steps upon the sandy waste.
9838,CATO,But more and more beneath their feet the dust
9839,CATO,"Began to harden, till the Libyan tracts"
9840,CATO,"Once more were earth, and in the distance rose"
9841,CATO,"Some groves of scanty foliage, and huts"
9842,CATO,Of plastered straw unfashioned: and their hearts
9843,CATO,Leaped at the prospect of a better land.
9844,CATO,How fled their sorrow!  how with growing joy
9845,CATO,They met the savage lion in the path!
9846,CATO,In tranquil Leptis first they found retreat:
9847,CATO,And passed a winter free from heat and rain. (31)
9848,CATO,
9849,CATO,When Caesar sated with Emathia's slain
9850,CATO,"Forsook the battlefield, all other cares"
9851,CATO,"Neglected, he pursued his kinsman fled,"
9852,CATO,On him alone intent: by land his steps
9853,CATO,"He traced in vain; then, rumour for his guide,"
9854,CATO,He crossed the sea and reached the Thracian strait
9855,CATO,For love renowned; where on the mournful shore
9856,CATO,"Rose Hero's tower, and Helle born of cloud (32)"
9857,CATO,Took from the rolling waves their former name.
9858,CATO,Nowhere with shorter space the sea divides
9859,CATO,Europe from Asia; though Pontus parts
9860,CATO,By scant division from Byzantium's hold
9861,CATO,Chalcedon oyster-rich: and small the strait
9862,CATO,Through which Propontis pours the Euxine wave.
9863,CATO,"Then marvelling at their ancient fame, he seeks"
9864,CATO,"Sigeum's sandy beach and Simois' stream,"
9865,CATO,"Rhoeteum noble for its Grecian tomb,"
9866,CATO,"And all the hero's shades, the theme of song."
9867,CATO,Next by the town of Troy burnt down of old
9868,CATO,"Now but a memorable name, he turns"
9869,CATO,"His steps, and searches for the mighty stones"
9870,CATO,Relics of Phoebus' wall.  But bare with age
9871,CATO,Forests of trees and hollow mouldering trunks
9872,CATO,"Pressed down Assaracus' palace, and with roots"
9873,CATO,"Wearied, possessed the temples of the gods."
9874,CATO,All Pergamus with densest brake was veiled
9875,CATO,And even her stones were perished.  He beheld
9876,CATO,"Thy rock, Hesione; the hidden grove,"
9877,CATO,Anchises' nuptial chamber; and the cave
9878,CATO,Where sat the arbiter; the spot from which
9879,CATO,Was snatched the beauteous youth; the mountain lawn
9880,CATO,Where played Oenone.  Not a stone but told
9881,CATO,The story of the past.  A little stream
9882,CATO,"Scarce trickling through the arid plain he passed,"
9883,CATO,"Nor knew 'twas Xanthus: deep in grass he placed,"
9884,CATO,"Careless, his footstep; but the herdsman cried"
9885,CATO,"""Thou tread'st the dust of Hector.""  Stones confused"
9886,CATO,Lay at his feet in sacred shape no more:
9887,CATO,"""Look on the altar of Jove,"" thus spake the guide,"
9888,CATO,"""God of the household, guardian of the home."""
9889,CATO,
9890,CATO,"O sacred task of poets, toil supreme,"
9891,CATO,Which rescuing all things from allotted fate
9892,CATO,Dost give eternity to mortal men!
9893,CATO,"Grudge not the glory, Caesar, of such fame."
9894,CATO,"For if the Latian Muse may promise aught,"
9895,CATO,Long as the heroes of the Trojan time
9896,CATO,"Shall live upon the page of Smyrna's bard,"
9897,CATO,So long shall future races read of thee
9898,CATO,In this my poem; and Pharsalia's song
9899,CATO,Live unforgotten in the age to come.
9900,CATO,
9901,CATO,When by the ancient grandeur of the place
9902,CATO,"The chieftain's sight was filled, of gathered turf"
9903,CATO,Altars he raised: and as the sacred flame
9904,CATO,"Cast forth its odours, these not idle vows"
9905,CATO,"Gave to the gods, ""Ye deities of the dead,"
9906,CATO,Who watch o'er Phrygian ruins: ye who now
9907,CATO,"Lavinia's homes inhabit, and Alba's height:"
9908,CATO,"Gods of my sire Aeneas, in whose fanes"
9909,CATO,The Trojan fire still burns: pledge of the past
9910,CATO,"Mysterious Pallas, (24) of the inmost shrine,"
9911,CATO,"Unseen of men!  here in your ancient seat,"
9912,CATO,"Most famous offspring of Iulus' race,"
9913,CATO,I call upon you and with pious hand
9914,CATO,Burn frequent offerings.  To my emprise
9915,CATO,Give prosperous ending!  Here shall I replace
9916,CATO,"The Phrygian peoples, here with glad return"
9917,CATO,"Italia's sons shall build another Troy,"
9918,CATO,"Here rise a Roman Pergamus."""
9919,CATO,
9920,CATO,"This said,"
9921,CATO,"He seeks his fleet, and eager to regain"
9922,CATO,"Time spent at Ilium, to the favouring breeze"
9923,CATO,"Spreads all his canvas.  Past rich Asia borne,"
9924,CATO,Rhodes soon he left while foamed the sparkling main
9925,CATO,Beneath his keels; nor ceased the wind to stretch
9926,CATO,"His bending sails, till on the seventh night"
9927,CATO,The Pharian beam proclaimed Egyptian shores.
9928,CATO,"But day arose, and veiled the nightly lamp"
9929,CATO,Ere rode his barks on waters safe from storm.
9930,CATO,"Then Caesar saw that tumult held the shore,"
9931,CATO,And mingled voices of uncertain sound
9932,CATO,Struck on his ear: and trusting not himself
9933,CATO,"To doubtful kingdoms, of uncertain troth,"
9934,CATO,He kept his ships from land.
9935,CATO,But from the king
9936,CATO,"Came his vile minion forth upon the wave,"
9937,CATO,"Bearing his dreadful gift, Pompeius' head,"
9938,CATO,Wrapped in a covering of Pharian wool.
9939,CATO,First took he speech and thus in shameless words
9940,CATO,"Commends the murder: ""Conqueror of the world,"
9941,CATO,"First of the Roman race, and, what as yet"
9942,CATO,"Thou dost not know, safe by thy kinsman slain;"
9943,CATO,"This gift receive from the Pellaean king,"
9944,CATO,"Sole trophy absent from the Thracian field,"
9945,CATO,To crown thy toils on lands and on the deep.
9946,CATO,Here in thine absence have we placed for thee
9947,CATO,An end upon the war.  Here Magnus came
9948,CATO,To mend his fallen fortunes; on our swords
9949,CATO,Here met his death.  With such a pledge of faith
9950,CATO,"Here have we bought thee, Caesar; with his blood"
9951,CATO,Seal we this treaty.  Take the Pharian realm
9952,CATO,"Sought by no bloodshed, take the rule of Nile,"
9953,CATO,Take all that thou would'st give for Magnus' life:
9954,CATO,And hold him vassal worthy of thy camp
9955,CATO,To whom the fates against thy son-in-law
9956,CATO,Such power entrusted; nor hold thou the deed
9957,CATO,"Lightly accomplished by the swordsman's stroke,"
9958,CATO,And so the merit.  Guest ancestral he
9959,CATO,"Who was its victim; who, his sire expelled,"
9960,CATO,Gave back to him the sceptre.  For a deed
9961,CATO,"So great, thou'lt find a name -- or ask the world."
9962,CATO,"If 'twas a crime, thou must confess the debt"
9963,CATO,"To us the greater, for that from thy hand"
9964,CATO,"We took the doing."""
9965,CATO,
9966,CATO,Then he held and showed
9967,CATO,Unveiled the head.  Now had the hand of death
9968,CATO,Passed with its changing touch upon the face:
9969,CATO,Nor at first sight did Caesar on the gift
9970,CATO,"Pass condemnation; nor avert his gaze,"
9971,CATO,But dwelt upon the features till he knew
9972,CATO,The crime accomplished.  Then when truth was sure
9973,CATO,"The loving father rose, and tears he shed"
9974,CATO,"Which flowed at his command, and glad in heart"
9975,CATO,Forced from his breast a groan: thus by the flow
9976,CATO,Of feigned tears and grief he hoped to hide
9977,CATO,His joy else manifest: and the ghastly boon
9978,CATO,"Sent by the king disparaging, professed"
9979,CATO,"Rather to mourn his son's dissevered head,"
9980,CATO,"Than count it for a debt.  For thee alone,"
9981,CATO,"Magnus, he durst not fail to find a tear:"
9982,CATO,"He, Caesar, who with mien unaltered spurned"
9983,CATO,"The Roman Senate, and with eyes undimmed"
9984,CATO,Looked on Pharsalia's field.  O fate most hard!
9985,CATO,Didst thou with impious war pursue the man
9986,CATO,Whom 'twas thy lot to mourn?  No kindred ties
9987,CATO,No memory of thy daughter and her son
9988,CATO,Touch on thy heart.  Didst think perchance that grief
9989,CATO,Might help thy cause 'mid lovers of his name?
9990,CATO,"Or haply, moved by envy of the king,"
9991,CATO,Griev'st that to other hands than thine was given
9992,CATO,To shed the captive's life-blood?  and complain'st
9993,CATO,Thy vengeance perished and the conquered chief
9994,CATO,Snatched from thy haughty hand?  Whate'er the cause
9995,CATO,"That urged thy grief, 'twas far removed from love."
9996,CATO,Was this forsooth the object of thy toil
9997,CATO,"O'er lands and oceans, that without thy ken"
9998,CATO,He should not perish?  Nay! but well was reft
9999,CATO,From thine arbitrament his fate.  What crime
10000,CATO,"Did cruel Fortune spare, what depth of shame"
10001,CATO,"To Roman honour!  since she suffered not,"
10002,CATO,"Perfidious traitor, while yet Magnus lived,"
10003,CATO,That thou should'st pity him!
10004,CATO,
10005,CATO,"Thus by words he dared,"
10006,CATO,To gain their credence in his sembled grief:
10007,CATO,"""Hence from my sight with thy detested gift,"
10008,CATO,"Thou minion, to thy King.  Worse does your crime"
10009,CATO,Deserve from Caesar than from Magnus' hands.
10010,CATO,The only prize that civil war affords
10011,CATO,Thus have we lost -- to bid the conquered live.
10012,CATO,If but the sister of this Pharian king
10013,CATO,"Were not by him detested, by the head"
10014,CATO,Of Cleopatra had I paid this gift.
10015,CATO,Such were the fit return.  Why did he draw
10016,CATO,"His separate sword, and in the toil that's ours"
10017,CATO,Mingle his weapons?  In Thessalia's field
10018,CATO,Gave we such right to the Pellaean blade?
10019,CATO,Magnus as partner in the rule of Rome
10020,CATO,I had not brooked; and shall I tolerate
10021,CATO,"Thee, Ptolemaeus?  In vain with civil wars"
10022,CATO,"Thus have we roused the nations, if there be"
10023,CATO,Now any might but Caesar's.  If one land
10024,CATO,"Yet owned two masters, I had turned from yours"
10025,CATO,"The prows of Latium; but fame forbids,"
10026,CATO,Lest men should whisper that I did not damn
10027,CATO,"This deed of blood, but feared the Pharian land."
10028,CATO,Nor think ye to deceive; victorious here
10029,CATO,I stand: else had my welcome at your hands
10030,CATO,Been that of Magnus; and that neck were mine
10031,CATO,But for Pharsalia's chance.  At greater risk
10032,CATO,"So seems it, than we dreamed of, took we arms;"
10033,CATO,"Exile, and Magnus' threats, and Rome I knew,"
10034,CATO,Not Ptolemaeus.  But we spare the boy:
10035,CATO,Pass by the murder.  Let the princeling know
10036,CATO,We give no more than pardon for his crime.
10037,CATO,"And now in honour of the mighty dead,"
10038,CATO,"Not merely that the earth may hide your guilt,"
10039,CATO,Lay ye the chieftain's head within the tomb;
10040,CATO,With proper sepulture appease his shade
10041,CATO,And place his scattered ashes in an urn.
10042,CATO,"Thus may he know my coming, and may hear"
10043,CATO,"Affection's accents, and my fond complaints."
10044,CATO,"Me sought he not, but rather, for his life,"
10045,CATO,This Pharian vassal; snatching from mankind
10046,CATO,The happy morning which had shown the world
10047,CATO,A peace between us.  But my prayers to heaven
10048,CATO,No favouring answer found; that arms laid down
10049,CATO,"In happy victory, Magnus, once again"
10050,CATO,"I might embrace thee, begging thee to grant"
10051,CATO,"Thine ancient love to Caesar, and thy life."
10052,CATO,Thus for my labours with a worthy prize
10053,CATO,"Content, thine equal, bound in faithful peace,"
10054,CATO,I might have brought thee to forgive the gods
10055,CATO,For thy disaster; thou had'st gained for me
10056,CATO,"From Rome forgiveness."""
10057,CATO,
10058,CATO,"Thus he spake, but found"
10059,CATO,No comrade in his tears; nor did the host
10060,CATO,Give credit to his grief.  Deep in their breasts
10061,CATO,"They hide their groans, and gaze with joyful front"
10062,CATO,(O famous Freedom!) on the deed of blood:
10063,CATO,And dare to laugh when mighty Caesar wept.

10180,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10181,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10182,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"When Caesar, following those who bore the head,"
10183,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"First trod the shore accursed, with Egypt's fates"
10184,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His fortunes battled, whether Rome should pass"
10185,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In crimson conquest o'er the guilty land,"
10186,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Or Memphis' arms should ravish from the world
10187,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Victor and vanquished: and the warning shade
10188,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of Magnus saved his kinsman from the sword.
10189,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10190,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"First, by the crime assured, his standards borne"
10191,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Before, he marched upon the Pharian town;"
10192,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"But when the people, jealous of their laws,"
10193,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Murmured against the fasces, Caesar knew"
10194,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Their minds were adverse, and that not for him"
10195,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Was Magnus' murder wrought.  And yet with brow
10196,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Dissembling fear, intrepid, through the shrines"
10197,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of Egypt's gods he strode, and round the fane"
10198,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of ancient Isis; bearing witness all
10199,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To Macedon's vigour in the days of old.
10200,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Yet did nor gold nor ornament restrain
10201,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His hasting steps, nor worship of the gods,"
10202,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor city ramparts: but in greed of gain
10203,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He sought the cave dug out amid the tombs. (1)
10204,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The madman offspring there of Philip lies
10205,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The famed Pellaean robber, fortune's friend,"
10206,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Snatched off by fate, avenging so the world."
10207,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In sacred sepulchre the hero's limbs,"
10208,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Which should be scattered o'er the earth, repose,"
10209,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Still spared by Fortune to these tyrant days:
10210,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"For in a world to freedom once recalled,"
10211,CAESAR IN EGYPT,All men had mocked the dust of him who set
10212,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The baneful lesson that so many lands
10213,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Can serve one master.  Macedon he left
10214,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His home obscure; Athena he despised
10215,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The conquest of his sire, and spurred by fate"
10216,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Through Asia rushed with havoc of mankind,"
10217,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Plunging his sword through peoples; streams unknown
10218,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Ran red with Persian and with Indian blood.
10219,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Curse of all earth and thunderbolt of ill
10220,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To every nation!  On the outer sea (2)
10221,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He launched his fleet to sail the ocean wave:
10222,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor flame nor flood nor sterile Libyan sands
10223,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Stayed back his course, nor Hammon's pathless shoals;"
10224,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Far to the west, where downward slopes the world"
10225,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He would have led his armies, and the poles"
10226,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Had compassed, and had drunk the fount of Nile:"
10227,CAESAR IN EGYPT,But came his latest day; such end alone
10228,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Could nature place upon the madman king,"
10229,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Who jealous in death as when he won the world
10230,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His empire with him took, nor left an heir."
10231,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thus every city to the spoiler's hand
10232,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Was victim made: Yet in his fall was his
10233,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Babylon; and Parthia feared him.  Shame on us
10234,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That eastern nations dreaded more the lance
10235,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of Macedon than now the Roman spear.
10236,CAESAR IN EGYPT,True that we rule beyond where takes its rise
10237,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The burning southern breeze, beyond the homes"
10238,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of western winds, and to the northern star;"
10239,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"But towards the rising of the sun, we yield"
10240,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To him who kept the Arsacids in awe;
10241,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And puny Pella held as province sure
10242,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The Parthia fatal to our Roman arms.
10243,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10244,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Now from the stream Pelusian of the Nile,"
10245,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Was come the boyish king, taming the rage"
10246,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of his effeminate people: pledge of peace;
10247,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And Caesar safely trod Pellaean halls;
10248,CAESAR IN EGYPT,When Cleopatra bribed her guard to break
10249,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The harbour chains, and borne in little boat"
10250,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Within the Macedonian palace gates,"
10251,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Caesar unknowing, entered: Egypt's shame;"
10252,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Fury of Latium; to the bane of Rome
10253,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Unchaste.  For as the Spartan queen of yore
10254,CAESAR IN EGYPT,By fatal beauty Argos urged to strife
10255,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And Ilium's homes, so Cleopatra roused"
10256,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Italia's frenzy.  By her drum (3) she called
10257,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Down on the Capitol terror (if to speak
10258,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Such word be lawful); mixed with Roman arms
10259,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Coward Canopus, hoping she might lead"
10260,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"A Pharian triumph, Caesar in her train;"
10261,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And 'twas in doubt upon Leucadian (4) waves
10262,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Whether a woman, not of Roman blood,"
10263,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Should hold the world in awe.  Such lofty thoughts
10264,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Seized on her soul upon that night in which
10265,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The wanton daughter of Pellaean kings
10266,CAESAR IN EGYPT,First shared our leaders' couches.  Who shall blame
10267,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Antonius for the madness of his love,"
10268,CAESAR IN EGYPT,When Caesar's haughty breast drew in the flame?
10269,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Who red with carnage, 'mid the clash of arms,"
10270,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In palace haunted by Pompeius' shade,"
10271,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Gave place to love; and in adulterous bed,"
10272,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Magnus forgotten, from the Queen impure,"
10273,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To Julia gave a brother: on the bounds,"
10274,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of furthest Libya permitting thus
10275,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His foe to gather: he in dalliance base
10276,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Waited upon his mistress, and to her"
10277,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Pharos would give, for her would conquer all."
10278,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10279,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Then Cleopatra, trusting to her charms,"
10280,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Tearless approached him, though in form of grief;"
10281,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Her tresses loose as though in sorrow torn,"
10282,CAESAR IN EGYPT,So best becoming her; and thus began:
10283,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""If, mighty Caesar, aught to noble birth"
10284,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Be due, give ear.  Of Lagian race am I"
10285,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Offspring illustrious; from my father's throne
10286,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Cast forth to banishment; unless thy hand
10287,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Restore to me the sceptre: then a Queen
10288,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Falls at thy feet embracing.  To our race
10289,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Bright star of justice thou!  Nor first shall I
10290,CAESAR IN EGYPT,As woman rule the cities of the Nile;
10291,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"For, neither sex preferring, Pharos bows"
10292,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To queenly governance.  Of my parted sire
10293,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Read the last words, by which 'tis mine to share"
10294,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With equal rights the kingdom and the bed.
10295,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And loves the boy his sister, were he free;"
10296,CAESAR IN EGYPT,But his affections and his sword alike
10297,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Pothinus orders.  Nor wish I myself
10298,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To wield my father's power; but this my prayer:
10299,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Save from this foul disgrace our royal house,"
10300,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Bid that the king shall reign, and from the court"
10301,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Remove this hateful varlet, and his arms."
10302,CAESAR IN EGYPT,How swells his bosom for that his the hand
10303,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That shore Pompeius' head!  And now he threats
10304,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thee, Caesar, also; which the Fates avert!"
10305,CAESAR IN EGYPT,'Twas shame enough upon the earth and thee
10306,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That of Pothinus Magnus should have been
10307,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The guilt or merit."""
10308,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10309,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Caesar's ears in vain
10310,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Had she implored, but aided by her charms"
10311,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The wanton's prayers prevailed, and by a night"
10312,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of shame ineffable, passed with her judge,"
10313,CAESAR IN EGYPT,She won his favour.
10314,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10315,CAESAR IN EGYPT,When between the pair (5)
10316,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Caesar had made a peace, by costliest gifts"
10317,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Purchased, a banquet of such glad event"
10318,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Made fit memorial; and with pomp the Queen
10319,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Displayed her luxuries, as yet unknown"
10320,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To Roman fashions.  First uprose the hall
10321,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Like to a fane which this corrupted age
10322,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Could scarcely rear: the lofty ceiling shone
10323,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"With richest tracery, the beams were bound"
10324,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In golden coverings; no scant veneer
10325,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Lay on its walls, but built in solid blocks"
10326,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of marble, gleamed the palace.  Agate stood"
10327,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In sturdy columns, bearing up the roof;"
10328,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Onyx and porphyry on the spacious floor
10329,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Were trodden 'neath the foot; the mighty gates
10330,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of Maroe's throughout were formed,"
10331,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He mere adornment; ivory clothed the hall,"
10332,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And fixed upon the doors with labour rare
10333,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Shells of the tortoise gleamed, from Indian seas,"
10334,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With frequent emeralds studded.  Gems of price
10335,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And yellow jasper on the couches shone.
10336,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Lustrous the coverlets; the major part
10337,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Dipped more than once within the vats of Tyre
10338,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Had drunk their juice: part feathered as with gold;
10339,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Part crimson dyed, in manner as are passed"
10340,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Through Pharian leash the threads.  There waited slaves
10341,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In number as a people, some in ranks"
10342,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By different blood distinguished, some by age;"
10343,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"This band with Libyan, that with auburn hair"
10344,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Red so that Caesar on the banks of Rhine
10345,CAESAR IN EGYPT,None such had witnessed; some with features scorched
10346,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By torrid suns, their locks in twisted coils"
10347,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Drawn from their foreheads.  Eunuchs too were there,"
10348,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Unhappy race; and on the other side
10349,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Men of full age whose cheeks with growth of hair
10350,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Were hardly darkened.
10351,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10352,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Upon either hand
10353,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Lay kings, and Caesar in the midst supreme."
10354,CAESAR IN EGYPT,There in her fatal beauty lay the Queen
10355,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thick daubed with unguents, nor with throne content"
10356,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor with her brother spouse; laden she lay
10357,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"On neck and hair with all the Red Sea spoils,"
10358,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And faint beneath the weight of gems and gold.
10359,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Her snowy breast shone through Sidonian lawn
10360,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Which woven close by shuttles of the east
10361,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The art of Nile had loosened.  Ivory feet
10362,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Bore citron tables brought from woods that wave (6)
10363,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"On Atlas, such as Caesar never saw"
10364,CAESAR IN EGYPT,When Juba was his captive.  Blind in soul
10365,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By madness of ambition, thus to fire"
10366,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By such profusion of her wealth, the mind"
10367,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of Caesar armed, her guest in civil war!"
10368,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Not though he aimed with pitiless hand to grasp
10369,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The riches of a world; not though were here
10370,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Those ancient leaders of the simple age,"
10371,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Fabricius or Curius stern of soul,"
10372,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Or he who, Consul, left in sordid garb"
10373,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His Tuscan plough, could all their several hopes"
10374,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Have risen to such spoil.  On plates of gold
10375,CAESAR IN EGYPT,They piled the banquet sought in earth and air
10376,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And from the deepest seas and Nilus' waves,"
10377,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Through all the world; in craving for display,"
10378,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"No hunger urging.  Frequent birds and beasts,"
10379,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Egypt's high gods, they placed upon the board:"
10380,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In crystal goblets water of the Nile
10381,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"They handed, and in massive cups of price"
10382,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Was poured the wine; no juice of Mareot grape (7)
10383,CAESAR IN EGYPT,But noble vintage of Falernian growth
10384,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Which in few years in Meroe's vats had foamed,"
10385,CAESAR IN EGYPT,(For such the clime) to ripeness.  On their brows
10386,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Chaplets were placed of roses ever young
10387,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With glistening nard entwined; and in their locks
10388,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Was cinnamon infused, not yet in air"
10389,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Its fragrance perished, nor in foreign climes;"
10390,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And rich amomum from the neighbouring fields.
10391,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thus Caesar learned the booty of a world
10392,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To lavish, and his breast was shamed of war"
10393,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Waged with his son-in-law for meagre spoil,"
10394,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And with the Pharian realm he longed to find
10395,CAESAR IN EGYPT,A cause of battle.
10396,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10397,CAESAR IN EGYPT,When of wine and feast
10398,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"They wearied and their pleasure found an end,"
10399,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Caesar drew out in colloquy the night
10400,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thus with Achoreus, on the highest couch"
10401,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With linen ephod as a priest begirt:
10402,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""O thou devoted to all sacred rites,"
10403,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Loved by the gods, as proves thy length of days,"
10404,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Tell, if thou wilt, whence sprang the Pharian race;"
10405,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"How lie their lands, the manners of their tribes,"
10406,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The form and worship of their deities.
10407,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Expound the sculptures on your ancient fanes:
10408,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Reveal your gods if willing to be known:
10409,CAESAR IN EGYPT,If to th' Athenian sage your fathers taught
10410,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Their mysteries, who worthier than I"
10411,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To bear in trust the secrets of the world?
10412,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"True, by the rumour of my kinsman's flight"
10413,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Here was I drawn; yet also by your fame:
10414,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And even in the midst of war's alarms
10415,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The stars and heavenly spaces have I conned;
10416,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor shall Eudoxus' year (8) excel mine own.
10417,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"But though such ardour burns within my breast,"
10418,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Such zeal to know the truth, yet my chief wish"
10419,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To learn the source of your mysterious flood
10420,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Through ages hidden: give me certain hope
10421,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To see the fount of Nile -- and civil war
10422,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Then shall I leave."""
10423,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10424,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He spake, and then the priest:"
10425,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""The secrets, Caesar, of our mighty sires (9)"
10426,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Kept from the common people until now
10427,CAESAR IN EGYPT,I hold it right to utter.  Some may deem
10428,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That silence on these wonders of the earth
10429,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Were greater piety.  But to the gods
10430,CAESAR IN EGYPT,I hold it grateful that their handiwork
10431,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And sacred edicts should be known to men.
10432,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10433,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""A different power by the primal law,"
10434,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Each star possesses: (10) these alone control
10435,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The movement of the sky, with adverse force"
10436,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Opposing: while the sun divides the year,"
10437,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And day from night, and by his potent rays"
10438,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Forbids the stars to pass their stated course.
10439,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The moon by her alternate phases sets
10440,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The varying limits of the sea and shore.
10441,CAESAR IN EGYPT,'Neath Saturn's sway the zone of ice and snow
10442,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Has passed; while Mars in lightning's fitful flames
10443,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And winds abounds' beneath high Jupiter
10444,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Unvexed by storms abides a temperate air;
10445,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And fruitful Venus' star contains the seeds
10446,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of all things.  Ruler of the boundless deep
10447,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The god (11) Cyllenian: whene'er he holds
10448,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That part of heaven where the Lion dwells
10449,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"With neighbouring Cancer joined, and Sirius star"
10450,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Flames in its fury; where the circular path
10451,CAESAR IN EGYPT,(Which marks the changes of the varying year)
10452,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Gives to hot Cancer and to Capricorn
10453,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Their several stations, under which doth lie"
10454,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The fount of Nile, he, master of the waves,"
10455,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Strikes with his beam the waters.  Forth the stream
10456,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Brims from his fount, as Ocean when the moon"
10457,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Commands an increase; nor shall curb his flow
10458,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Till night wins back her losses from the sun. (12)
10459,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10460,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""Vain is the ancient faith that Ethiop snows (13)"
10461,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Send Nile abundant forth upon the lands.
10462,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Those mountains know nor northern wind nor star.
10463,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of this are proof the breezes of the South,"
10464,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Fraught with warm vapours, and the people's hue"
10465,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Burned dark by suns: and 'tis in time of spring,"
10466,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"When first are thawed the snows, that ice-fed streams"
10467,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In swollen torrents tumble; but the Nile
10468,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor lifts his wave before the Dog star burns;
10469,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Nor seeks again his banks, until the sun"
10470,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In equal balance measures night and day.
10471,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor are the laws that govern other streams
10472,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Obeyed by Nile.  For in the wintry year
10473,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Were he in flood, when distant far the sun,"
10474,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His waters lacked their office; but he leaves
10475,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His channel when the summer is at height,"
10476,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Tempering the torrid heat of Egypt's clime.
10477,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Such is the task of Nile; thus in the world
10478,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He finds his purpose, lest exceeding heat"
10479,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Consume the lands: and rising thus to meet
10480,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Enkindled Lion, to Syene's prayers"
10481,CAESAR IN EGYPT,By Cancer burnt gives ear; nor curbs his wave
10482,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Till the slant sun and Meroe's lengthening shades
10483,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Proclaim the autumn.  Who shall give the cause?
10484,CAESAR IN EGYPT,'Twas Parent Nature's self which gave command
10485,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thus for the needs of earth should flow the Nile.
10486,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10487,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""Vain too the fable that the western winds (14)"
10488,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Control his current, in continuous course"
10489,CAESAR IN EGYPT,At stated seasons governing the air;
10490,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Or hurrying from Occident to South
10491,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Clouds without number which in misty folds
10492,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Press on the waters; or by constant blast,"
10493,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Forcing his current back whose several mouths
10494,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Burst on the sea; -- so, forced by seas and wind,"
10495,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Men say, his billows pour upon the land."
10496,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Some speak of hollow caverns, breathing holes"
10497,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Deep in the earth, within whose mighty jaws"
10498,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Waters in noiseless current underneath
10499,CAESAR IN EGYPT,From northern cold to southern climes are drawn:
10500,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And when hot Meroe pants beneath the sun,"
10501,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Then, say they, Ganges through the silent depths"
10502,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And Padus pass: and from a single fount
10503,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The Nile arising not in single streams
10504,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Pours all the rivers forth.  And rumour says
10505,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That when the sea which girdles in the world (15)
10506,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"O'erflows, thence rushes Nile, by lengthy course,"
10507,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Softening his saltness.  More, if it be true"
10508,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"That ocean feeds the sun and heavenly fires,"
10509,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Then Phoebus journeying by the burning Crab
10510,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Sucks from its waters more than air can hold
10511,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Upon his passage -- this the cool of night
10512,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Pours on the Nile.
10513,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10514,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""If, Caesar, 'tis my part"
10515,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To judge such difference, 'twould seem that since"
10516,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Creation's age has passed, earth's veins by chance"
10517,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Some waters hold, and shaken cast them forth:"
10518,CAESAR IN EGYPT,But others took when first the globe was formed
10519,CAESAR IN EGYPT,A sure abode; by Him who framed the world
10520,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Fixed with the Universe.
10521,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10522,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""And, Roman, thou,"
10523,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In thirsting thus to know the source of Nile
10524,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Dost as the Pharian and Persian kings
10525,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And those of Macedon; nor any age
10526,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Refused the secret, but the place prevailed"
10527,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Remote by nature.  Greatest of the kings
10528,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By Memphis worshipped, Alexander grudged (16)"
10529,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To Nile its mystery, and to furthest earth"
10530,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Sent chosen Ethiops whom the crimson zone
10531,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Stayed in their further march, while flowed his stream"
10532,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Warm at their feet.  Sesostris (17) westward far
10533,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Reached, to the ends of earth; and necks of kings"
10534,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Bent 'neath his chariot yoke: but of the springs
10535,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Which fill your rivers, Rhone and Po, he drank."
10536,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Not of the fount of Nile.  Cambyses king
10537,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In madman quest led forth his host to where
10538,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The long-lived races dwell: then famine struck,"
10539,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Ate of his dead (17) and, Nile unknown, returned."
10540,CAESAR IN EGYPT,No lying rumour of thy hidden source
10541,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Has e'er made mention; wheresoe'er thou art
10542,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Yet art thou sought, nor yet has nation claimed"
10543,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In pride of place thy river as its own.
10544,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Yet shall I tell, so far as has the god,"
10545,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Who veils thy fountain, given me to know."
10546,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thy progress.  Daring to upraise thy banks
10547,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"'Gainst fiery Cancer's heat, thou tak'st thy rise"
10548,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Beneath the zenith: straight towards the north
10549,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And mid Bootes flowing; to the couch
10550,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Bending, or to the risings, of the sun"
10551,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In sinuous bends alternate; just alike
10552,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To Araby's peoples and to Libyan sands.
10553,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By Seres (18) first beheld, yet know they not"
10554,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10555,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Whence art thou come; and with no native stream
10556,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Strik'st thou the Ethiop fields.  Nor knows the world
10557,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To whom it owes thee.  Nature ne'er revealed
10558,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thy secret origin, removed afar."
10559,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor did she wish thee to be seen of men
10560,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"While still a tiny rivulet, but preferred"
10561,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Their wonder to their knowledge.  Where the sun
10562,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Stays at his limit, dost thou rise in flood"
10563,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Untimely; such try right: to other lands
10564,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Bearing try winter: and by both the poles
10565,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thou only wanderest.  Here men ask thy rise
10566,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And there thine ending.  Meroe rich in soil
10567,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And tilled by swarthy husbandmen divides
10568,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thy broad expanse, rejoicing in the leaves"
10569,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of groves of ebony, which though spreading far"
10570,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Their branching foliage, by no breadth of shade"
10571,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Soften the summer sun -- whose rays direct
10572,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Pass from the Lion to the fervid earth. (20)
10573,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Next dost thou journey onwards past the realm
10574,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of burning Phoebus, and the sterile sands,"
10575,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With equal volume; now with all thy strength
10576,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Gathered in one, and now in devious streams"
10577,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Parting the bank that crumbles at thy touch.
10578,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Then by our kingdom's gates, where Philae parts"
10579,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Arabian peoples from Egyptian fields
10580,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The sluggish bosom of thy flood recalls
10581,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Try wandering currents, which through desert wastes"
10582,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Flow gently on to where the merchant track
10583,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Divides the Red Sea waters from our own.
10584,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Who, gazing, Nile, upon thy tranquil flow,"
10585,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Could picture how in wild array of foam
10586,CAESAR IN EGYPT,(Where shelves the earth) thy billows shall be plunged
10587,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Down the steep cataracts, in fuming wrath"
10588,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That rocks should bar the passage of thy stream
10589,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Free from its source?  For whirled on high the spray
10590,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Aims at the stars, and trembles all the air"
10591,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With rush of waters; and with sounding roar
10592,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The foaming mass down from the summit pours
10593,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In hoary waves victorious.  Next an isle
10594,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In all our ancient lore ""untrodden"" named"
10595,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Stems firm thy torrent; and the rocks we call
10596,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Springs of the river, for that here are marked"
10597,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The earliest tokens of the coming flood.
10598,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With mountain shores now nature hems thee in
10599,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And shuts thy waves from Libya; in the midst
10600,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Hence do thy waters run, till Memphis first"
10601,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Forbids the barrier placed upon thy stream
10602,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And gives thee access to the open fields."""
10603,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10604,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thus did they pass, as though in peace profound,"
10605,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The nightly watches.  But Pothinus' mind,"
10606,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Once with accursed butchery imbued,"
10607,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Was frenzied still; since great Pompeius fell
10608,CAESAR IN EGYPT,No deed to him was crime; his rabid soul
10609,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Th' avenging goddesses and Magnus' shade
10610,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Stirred to fresh horrors; and a Pharian hand
10611,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"No less was worthy, as he deemed, to shed"
10612,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That blood which Fortune purposed should bedew
10613,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The conquered fathers: and the fell revenge
10614,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Due to the senate for the civil war
10615,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"This hireling almost snatched.  Avert, ye fates,"
10616,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Far hence the shame that not by Brutus' hand
10617,CAESAR IN EGYPT,This blow be struck!  Shall thus the tyrant's fall
10618,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Just at our hands, become a Pharian crime,"
10619,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Reft of example?  To prepare a plan
10620,CAESAR IN EGYPT,(Fated to fail) he dares; nor veils in fraud
10621,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"A plot for murder, but with open war"
10622,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Attacks th' unconquered chieftain: from his crimes
10623,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He gained such courage as to send command
10624,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To lop the head of Caesar, and to join"
10625,CAESAR IN EGYPT,In death the kinsmen chiefs.
10626,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10627,CAESAR IN EGYPT,These words by night
10628,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His faithful servants to Achillas bear,"
10629,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His foul associate, whom the boy had made"
10630,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Chief of his armies, and who ruled alone"
10631,CAESAR IN EGYPT,O'er Egypt's land and o'er himself her king:
10632,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"""Now lay thy limbs upon the sumptuous couch"
10633,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And sleep in luxury, for the Queen hath seized"
10634,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The palace; nor alone by her betrayed,"
10635,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"But Caesar's gift, is Pharos.  Dost delay"
10636,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor hasten to the chamber of thy Queen?
10637,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thou only?  Married to the Latian chief,"
10638,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The impious sister now her brother weds
10639,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And hurrying from rival spouse to spouse
10640,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Hath Egypt won, and plays the bawd for Rome."
10641,CAESAR IN EGYPT,By amorous potions she has won the man:
10642,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Then trust the boy!  Yet give him but a night
10643,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In her enfondling arms, and drunk with love"
10644,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thy life and mine he'll barter for a kiss.
10645,CAESAR IN EGYPT,We for his sister's charms by cross and flame
10646,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Shall pay the penalty: nor hope of aid;
10647,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Here stands adulterous Caesar, here the King"
10648,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Her spouse: how hope we from so stern a judge
10649,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To gain acquittal?  Shall she not condemn
10650,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Those who ne'er sought her favours?  By the deed
10651,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"We dared together and lost, by Magnus' blood"
10652,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Which wrought the bond between us, be thou swift"
10653,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With hasty tumult to arouse the war:
10654,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Dash in with nightly band, and mar with death"
10655,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Their shameless nuptials: on the very bed
10656,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With either lover smite the ruthless Queen.
10657,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor let the fortunes of the Western chief
10658,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Make pause our enterprise.  We share with him
10659,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The glory of his empire o'er the world.
10660,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Pompeius fallen makes us too sublime.
10661,CAESAR IN EGYPT,There lies the shore that bids us hope success:
10662,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Ask of our power from the polluted wave,"
10663,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And gaze upon the scanty tomb which holds
10664,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Not all Pompeius' ashes.  Peer to him
10665,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Was he whom now thou fearest.  Noble blood
10666,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"True, is not ours: what boots it?  Nor are realms"
10667,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor wealth of peoples given to our command.
10668,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Yet have we risen to a height of power
10669,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"For deeds of blood, and Fortune to our hands"
10670,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Attracts her victims.  Lo!  a nobler now
10671,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Lies in our compass, and a second death"
10672,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Hesperia shall appease; for Caesar's blood,"
10673,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Shed by these hands, shall give us this, that Rome"
10674,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Shall love us, guilty of Pompeius' fall."
10675,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Why fear these titles, why this chieftain's strength?"
10676,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"For shorn of these, before your swords he lies"
10677,CAESAR IN EGYPT,A common soldier.  To the civil war
10678,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"This night shall bring completion, and shall give"
10679,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To peoples slain fit offerings, and send"
10680,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That life the world demands beneath the shades.
10681,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Rise then in all your hardihood and smite
10682,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"This Caesar down, and let the Roman youths"
10683,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Strike for themselves, and Lagos for its King."
10684,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor do thou tarry: full of wine and feast
10685,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thou'lt fall upon him in the lists of love;
10686,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Then dare the venture, and the heavenly gods"
10687,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Shall grant of Cato's and of Brutus' prayers
10688,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To thee fulfilment."""
10689,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10690,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor was Achillas slow
10691,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To hear the voice that counselled him to crime.
10692,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"No sounding clarion summoned, as is wont,"
10693,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His troops to arms; nor trumpet blare betrayed
10694,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Their nightly march: but rapidly he seized
10695,CAESAR IN EGYPT,All needed instruments of blood and war.
10696,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of Latian race the most part of his train,"
10697,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Yet to barbarian customs were their minds
10698,CAESAR IN EGYPT,By long forgetfulness of Rome debased:
10699,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Else had it shamed to serve the Pharian King;
10700,CAESAR IN EGYPT,But now his vassal and his minion's word
10701,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Compel obedience.  Those who serve in camps
10702,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Lose faith and love of kin: their pittance earned (21)
10703,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Makes just the deed: and for their sordid pay,"
10704,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Not for themselves, they threaten Caesar's life."
10705,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Where finds the piteous destiny of the realm
10706,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Rome with herself at peace?  The host withdrawn
10707,CAESAR IN EGYPT,From dread Thessalia raves on Nilus' banks
10708,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"As all the race of Rome.  What more had dared,"
10709,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"With Magnus welcomed, the Lagean house?"
10710,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Each hand must render to the gods their due,"
10711,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor son of Rome may cease from civil war;
10712,CAESAR IN EGYPT,By Heaven's command our state was rent in twain;
10713,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor love for husband nor regard for sire
10714,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Parted our peoples.  'Twas a slave who stirred
10715,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Afresh the conflict, and Achillas grasped"
10716,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In turn the sword of Rome: nay more, had won,"
10717,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Had not the fates adverse restrained his hand
10718,CAESAR IN EGYPT,From Caesar's slaughter.
10719,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10720,CAESAR IN EGYPT,For the murderous pair
10721,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Ripe for their plot were met; the spacious hall
10722,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Still busied with the feast.  So might have flowed
10723,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Into the kingly cups a stream of gore,"
10724,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And in mid banquet fallen Caesar's head.
10725,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Yet did they fear lest in the nightly strife
10726,CAESAR IN EGYPT,(The fates permitting) some incautious hand --
10727,CAESAR IN EGYPT,So did they trust the sword -- might slay the King.
10728,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thus stayed the deed, for in the minds of slaves"
10729,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The chance of doing Caesar to the death
10730,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Might bear postponement: when the day arose
10731,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Then should he suffer; and a night of life
10732,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thus by Pothinus was to Caesar given.
10733,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10734,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Now from the Casian rock looked forth the Sun
10735,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Flooding the land of Egypt with a day
10736,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Warm from its earliest dawn, when from the walls"
10737,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Not wandering in disorder are they seen,"
10738,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"But drown in close array, as though to meet"
10739,CAESAR IN EGYPT,A foe opposing; ready to receive
10740,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Or give the battle.  Caesar, in the town"
10741,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Placing no trust, within the palace courts"
10742,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Lay in ignoble hiding place, the gates"
10743,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Close barred: nor all the kingly rooms possessed,"
10744,CAESAR IN EGYPT,But in the narrowest portion of the space
10745,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He drew his band together.  There in arms
10746,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"They stood, with dread and fury in their souls."
10747,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He feared attack, indignant at his fear."
10748,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thus will a noble beast in little cage
10749,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Imprisoned, fume, and break upon the bars"
10750,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His teeth in frenzied wrath; nor more would rage
10751,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The flames of Vulcan in Sicilian depths
10752,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Should Etna's top be closed.  He who but now
10753,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By Haemus' mount against Pompeius chief,"
10754,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Italia's leaders and the Senate line,"
10755,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"His cause forbidding hope, looked at the fates"
10756,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He knew were hostile, with unfaltering gaze,"
10757,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Now fears before the crime of hireling slaves,"
10758,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And in mid palace trembles at the blow:
10759,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He whom nor Scythian nor Alaun (22) had dared
10760,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To violate, nor the Moor who aims the dart"
10761,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Upon his victim slain, to prove his skill."
10762,CAESAR IN EGYPT,The Roman world but now did not suffice
10763,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To hold him, nor the realms from furthest Ind"
10764,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To Tyrian Gades.  Now, as puny boy,"
10765,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Or woman, trembling when a town is sacked,"
10766,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Within the narrow corners of a house
10767,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He seeks for safety; on the portals closed
10768,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His hope of life; and with uncertain gait
10769,CAESAR IN EGYPT,He treads the hails; yet not without the King;
10770,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"In purpose, Ptolemaeus, that thy life"
10771,CAESAR IN EGYPT,For his shall give atonement; and to hurl
10772,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thy severed head among the servant throng
10773,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Should darts and torches fail.  So story tells
10774,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The Colchian princess (23) with sword in hand,"
10775,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"And with her brother's neck bared to the blow,"
10776,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Waited her sire, avenger of his realm"
10777,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Despoiled, and of her flight.  In the imminent risk"
10778,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Caesar, in hopes of peace, an envoy sent"
10779,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"To the fierce vassals, from their absent lord"
10780,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Bearing a message, thus: ""At whose command"
10781,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Wage ye the war?""  But not the laws which bind"
10782,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"All nations upon earth, nor sacred rights,"
10783,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Availed to save or messenger of peace,"
10784,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Or King's ambassador; or thee from crime
10785,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Such as befitted thee, thou land of Nile"
10786,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Fruitful in monstrous deeds: not Juba's realm
10787,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Vast though it be, nor Pontus, nor the land"
10788,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Thessalian, nor the arms of Pharnaces,"
10789,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Nor yet the tracts which chill Iberus girds,"
10790,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Nor Libyan coasts such wickedness have dared,"
10791,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"As thou, with all thy luxuries.  Closer now"
10792,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"War hemmed them in, and weapons in the courts,"
10793,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Shaking the innermost recesses, fell."
10794,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Yet did no ram, fatal with single stroke,"
10795,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Assail the portal, nor machine of war;"
10796,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor flame they called in aid; but blind of plan
10797,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"They wander purposeless, in separate bands"
10798,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Around the circuit, nor at any spot"
10799,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With strength combined attempt to breach the wall.
10800,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The fates forbad, and Fortune from their hands"
10801,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Held fast the palace as a battlement.
10802,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor failed they to attack from ships of war
10803,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The regal dwelling, where its frontage bold"
10804,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Made stand apart the waters of the deep:
10805,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"There, too, was Caesar's all-protecting arm;"
10806,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"For these at point of sword, and those with fire (24)"
10807,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He forces back, and though besieged he dares"
10808,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To storm th' assailants: and as lay the ships
10809,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Joined rank to rank, bids drop upon their sides"
10810,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Lamps drenched with reeking tar.  Nor slow the fire
10811,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To seize the hempen cables and the decks
10812,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Oozing with melting pitch; the oarsman's bench
10813,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"All in one moment, and the topmost yards"
10814,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Burst into flame: half merged the vessels lay
10815,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"While swam the foemen, all in arms, the wave;"
10816,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Nor fell the blaze upon the ships alone,"
10817,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"But seized with writhing tongues the neighbouring homes,"
10818,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And fanned to fury by the Southern breeze
10819,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Tempestuous, it leaped from roof to roof;"
10820,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Not otherwise than on its heavenly track,"
10821,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Unfed by matter, glides the ball of light,"
10822,CAESAR IN EGYPT,By air alone aflame.
10823,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10824,CAESAR IN EGYPT,This pest recalled
10825,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Some of the forces to the city's aid
10826,CAESAR IN EGYPT,From the besieged halls.  Nor Caesar gave
10827,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To sleep its season; swifter than all else
10828,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To seize the crucial moment of the war.
10829,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Quick in the darkest watches of the night
10830,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"He leaped upon his ships, and Pharos (25) seized,"
10831,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Gate of the main; an island in the days
10832,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of Proteus seer, now bordering the walls"
10833,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Of Alexander's city.  Thus he gained
10834,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"A double vantage, for his foes were pent"
10835,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Within the narrow entrance, which for him"
10836,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And for his aids gave access to the sea.
10837,CAESAR IN EGYPT,
10838,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Nor longer was Pothinus' doom delayed,"
10839,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Yet not with cross or flame, nor with the wrath"
10840,CAESAR IN EGYPT,His crime demanded; nor by savage beasts
10841,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Torn, did he suffer; but by Magnus' death,"
10842,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Alas the shame!  he fell; his head by sword
10843,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Hacked from his shoulders.  Next by frauds prepared
10844,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"By Ganymede her base attendant, fled"
10845,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Arsinoe (26) from the Court to Caesar's foes;
10846,CAESAR IN EGYPT,There in the absence of the King she ruled
10847,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"As of Lagean blood: there at her hands,"
10848,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The savage minion of the tyrant boy,"
10849,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Achillas, fell by just avenging sword."
10850,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Thus did another victim to thy shade
10851,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Atone, Pompeius; but the gods forbid"
10852,CAESAR IN EGYPT,That this be all thy vengeance!  Not the king
10853,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Nor all the stock of Lagos for thy death
10854,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Would make fit sacrifice!  So Fortune deemed;
10855,CAESAR IN EGYPT,And not till patriot swords shall drink the blood
10856,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Of Caesar, Magnus, shalt thou be appeased."
10857,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Still, though was slain the author of the strife,"
10858,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Sank not their rage: with Ganymede for chief
10859,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Again they rush to arms; in deeds of fight
10860,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Again they conquer.  So might that one day
10861,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Have witnessed Caesar's fate; so might its fame
10862,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Have lived through ages.

10865,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Crushed on the narrow surface of the mole,"
10866,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Prepared to throw his troops upon the ships,"
10867,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Sudden upon him the surrounding foes
10868,CAESAR IN EGYPT,With all their terrors came.  In dense array
10869,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Their navy lined the shores, while on the rear"
10870,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"The footmen ceaseless charged.  No hope was left,"
10871,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"For flight was not, nor could the brave man's arm"
10872,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Achieve or safety or a glorious death.
10873,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Not now were needed for great Caesar's fall,"
10874,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Caught in the toils of nature, routed host"
10875,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Or mighty heaps of slain: his only doubt
10876,CAESAR IN EGYPT,To fear or hope for death: while on his brain
10877,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Brave Scaeva's image flashed, now vainly sought,"
10878,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Who on the wall by Epidamnus' fields
10879,CAESAR IN EGYPT,"Earned fame immortal, and with single arm"
10880,CAESAR IN EGYPT,Drove back Pompeius as he trod the breach....

10915,ENDNOTES:,"this god, who controlled the rise and fall of the waves of"
10916,ENDNOTES:,"the sea, also when he was placed directly over the Nile"
10917,ENDNOTES:,caused the rise of that river.

10968,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"Lucan's ""Pharsalia"" (or, ""Civil War"", as many scholars now prefer"

10970,PREPARER'S NOTES:,it chronicles took place.
10971,PREPARER'S NOTES:,
10972,PREPARER'S NOTES:,Lucan was born into a prominent Roman family (Seneca the Elder
10973,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"was his grandfather, and Seneca the Younger his uncle), and seems"
10974,PREPARER'S NOTES:,to have befriended the young Emperor Nero at an early age.  He
10975,PREPARER'S NOTES:,was for several years a poet of some prominence in the Emperor's
10976,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"court, and it is during this period that the ""Civil"
10977,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"War""/""Pharsalia"" was probably begun.  However, Nero and Lucan's"
10978,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"friendship evidently soured, and in A.D. 65 Lucan joined"
10979,PREPARER'S NOTES:,Calpurnius Piso's conspiracy to overthrow Nero.  When the
10980,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"conspiracy was discovered, Lucan was given the option of suicide"
10981,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"or death; he chose suicide, and recited several lines of his"

10983,PREPARER'S NOTES:,
10984,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"Lucan's ""Pharsalia"" was left (probably) unfinished upon his"

10987,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"War"".  Ten books are extant; no one knows how many more Lucan"

10990,PREPARER'S NOTES:,estimate.
10991,PREPARER'S NOTES:,
10992,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"It should be noted that, as history, Lucan's work is far from"
10993,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"being scrupulously accurate, frequently ignoring historical fact"
10994,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"for the benefit of drama and rhetoric.  For this reason, it"
10995,PREPARER'S NOTES:,should not be read as a reliable account of the Roman Civil War.
10996,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"However, as a work of poetic literature, it has few rivals; its"
10997,PREPARER'S NOTES:,powerful depiction of civil war and its consequences have haunted
10998,PREPARER'S NOTES:,"readers for centuries, and prompted many Medieval and Renaissance"
