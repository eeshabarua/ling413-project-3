48,ARGUMENT,
49,ARGUMENT,"Hrothgar, king of the Danes, lives happily and peacefully, and bethinks"
50,ARGUMENT,"him to build a glorious hall called Hart. But a little after, one"
51,ARGUMENT,"Grendel, of the kindred of the evil wights that are come of Cain, hears"
52,ARGUMENT,the merry noise of Hart and cannot abide it; so he enters thereinto by
53,ARGUMENT,"night, and slays and carries off and devours thirty of Hrothgar's"
54,ARGUMENT,"thanes. Thereby he makes Hart waste for twelve years, and the tidings of"
55,ARGUMENT,this mishap are borne wide about lands. Then comes to the helping of
56,ARGUMENT,"Hrothgar Beowulf, the son of Ecgtheow, a thane of King Hygelac of the"
57,ARGUMENT,"Geats, with fourteen fellows. They are met on the shore by the"
58,ARGUMENT,"land-warder, and by him shown to Hart and the stead of Hrothgar, who"
59,ARGUMENT,"receives them gladly, and to whom Beowulf tells his errand, that he will"
60,ARGUMENT,"help him against Grendel. They feast in the hall, and one Unferth, son"
61,ARGUMENT,"of Ecglaf, taunts Beowulf through jealousy that he was outdone by Breca"
62,ARGUMENT,"in swimming. Beowulf tells the true tale thereof. And a little after, at"
63,ARGUMENT,"nightfall, Hrothgar and his folk leave the hall Hart, and it is given in"
64,ARGUMENT,"charge to Beowulf, who with his Geats abides there the coming of"
65,ARGUMENT,Grendel.
66,ARGUMENT,
67,ARGUMENT,"Soon comes Grendel to the hall, and slays a man of the Geats, hight"
68,ARGUMENT,"Handshoe, and then grapples with Beowulf, who will use no weapon against"
69,ARGUMENT,"him: Grendel feels himself over-mastered and makes for the door, and"
70,ARGUMENT,"gets out, but leaves his hand and arm behind him with Beowulf: men on"
71,ARGUMENT,the wall hear the great noise of this battle and the wailing of Grendel.
72,ARGUMENT,"In the morning the Danes rejoice, and follow the bloody slot of Grendel,"
73,ARGUMENT,"and return to Hart racing and telling old tales, as of Sigemund and the"
74,ARGUMENT,"Worm. Then come the king and his thanes to look on the token of victory,"
75,ARGUMENT,"Grendel's hand and arm, which Beowulf has let fasten: to the hall-gable."
76,ARGUMENT,
77,ARGUMENT,"The king praises Beowulf and rewards him, and they feast in Hart, and"
78,ARGUMENT,"the tale of Finn and Hengest is told. Then Hrothgar leaves Hart, and so"
79,ARGUMENT,"does Beowulf also with his Geats, but the Danes keep guard there."
80,ARGUMENT,
81,ARGUMENT,"In the night comes in Grendel's Mother, and catches up Aeschere, a thane"
82,ARGUMENT,"of Hrothgar, and carries him off to her lair. In the morning is Beowulf"
83,ARGUMENT,"fetched to Hrothgar, who tells him of this new grief and craves his"
84,ARGUMENT,help.
85,ARGUMENT,
86,ARGUMENT,"Then they follow up the slot and come to a great water-side, and find"
87,ARGUMENT,"thereby Aeschere's head, and the place is known for the lair of those"
88,ARGUMENT,"two: monsters are playing in the deep, and Beowulf shoots one of them to"
89,ARGUMENT,"death. Then Beowulf dights him and leaps into the water, and is a day's"
90,ARGUMENT,while reaching the bottom. There he is straightway caught hold of by
91,ARGUMENT,"Grendel's Mother, who bears him into her hall. When he gets free he"
92,ARGUMENT,"falls on her, but the edge of the sword Hrunting (lent to him by"
93,ARGUMENT,"Unferth) fails him, and she casts him to the ground and draws her sax to"
94,ARGUMENT,"slay him; but he rises up, and sees an old sword of the giants hanging"
95,ARGUMENT,on the wall; he takes it and smites off her head therewith. He sees
96,ARGUMENT,"Grendel lying dead, and his head also he strikes off; but the blade of"
97,ARGUMENT,"the sword is molten in his venomous blood. Then Beowulf strikes upward,"
98,ARGUMENT,taking with him the head of Grendel and the hilts of the sword. When he
99,ARGUMENT,comes to the shore he finds his Geats there alone; for the Danes fled
100,ARGUMENT,when they saw the blood floating in the water.
101,ARGUMENT,
102,ARGUMENT,"They go up to Hrothgar's stead, and four men must needs bear the head."
103,ARGUMENT,"They come to Hrothgar, and Beowulf gives him the hilts and tells him"
104,ARGUMENT,what he has done. Much praise is given to Beowulf; and they feast
105,ARGUMENT,together.
106,ARGUMENT,
107,ARGUMENT,"On the morrow Beowulf bids farewell to Hrothgar, more gifts are given,"
108,ARGUMENT,and messages are sent to Hygelac: Beowulf departs with the full love of
109,ARGUMENT,"Hrothgar. The Geats come to their ship and reward the ship-warder, and"
110,ARGUMENT,put off and sail to their own land. Beowulf comes to Hygelac's house.
111,ARGUMENT,"Hygelac is told of, and his wife Hygd, and her good conditions, against"
112,ARGUMENT,whom is set as a warning the evil Queen Thrytho.
113,ARGUMENT,
114,ARGUMENT,"Beowulf tells all the tale of his doings in full to Hygelac, and gives"
115,ARGUMENT,"him his gifts, and the precious-gemmed collar to Hygd. Here is told of"
116,ARGUMENT,"Beowulf, and how he was contemned in his youth, and is now grown so"
117,ARGUMENT,renowned.
118,ARGUMENT,
119,ARGUMENT,"Time wears; Hygelac is slain in battle; Heardred, his son, reigns in his"
120,ARGUMENT,"stead, he is slain by the Swedes, and Beowulf is made king. When he is"
121,ARGUMENT,"grown old, and has been king for fifty years, come new tidings. A great"
122,ARGUMENT,dragon finds on the sea-shore a mound wherein is stored the treasure of
123,ARGUMENT,"ancient folk departed. The said dragon abides there, and broods the gold"
124,ARGUMENT,for 300 years.
125,ARGUMENT,
126,ARGUMENT,"Now a certain thrall, who had misdone against his lord and was fleeing"
127,ARGUMENT,"from his wrath, haps on the said treasure and takes a cup thence, which"
128,ARGUMENT,"he brings to his lord to appease his wrath. The Worm waketh, and findeth"
129,ARGUMENT,"his treasure lessened, but can find no man who hath done the deed."
130,ARGUMENT,"Therefore he turns on the folk, and wars on them, and burns Beowulf's"
131,ARGUMENT,house.
132,ARGUMENT,
133,ARGUMENT,"Now Beowulf will go and meet the Worm. He has an iron shield made, and"
134,ARGUMENT,sets forth with eleven men and the thrall the thirteenth. He comes to
135,ARGUMENT,"the ness, and speaks to his men, telling them of his past days, and"
136,ARGUMENT,"gives them his last greeting: then he cries out a challenge to the Worm,"
137,ARGUMENT,"who comes forth, and the battle begins: Beowulf's sword will not bite on"
138,ARGUMENT,"the Worm. Wiglaf eggs on the others to come to Beowulf's help, and goes"
139,ARGUMENT,"himself straightway, and offers himself to Beowulf; the Worm comes on"
140,ARGUMENT,"again, and Beowulf breaks his sword NÃ¦gling on him, and the Worm wounds"
141,ARGUMENT,"Beowulf. Wiglaf smites the Worm in the belly; Beowulf draws his ax, and"
142,ARGUMENT,between them they slay the Worm.
143,ARGUMENT,
144,ARGUMENT,"Beowulf now feels his wounds, and knows that he is hurt deadly; he sits"
145,ARGUMENT,"down by the wall, and Wiglaf bathes his wounds. Beowulf speaks, tells"
146,ARGUMENT,how he would give his armour to his son if he had one; thanks God that
147,ARGUMENT,he has not sworn falsely or done guilefully; and prays Wiglaf to bear
148,ARGUMENT,out the treasure that he may see it before he dies.
149,ARGUMENT,
150,ARGUMENT,"Wiglaf fetches out the treasure, and again bathes Beowulf's wounds;"
151,ARGUMENT,"Beowulf speaks again, rejoices over the sight of the treasure; gives to"
152,ARGUMENT,"Wiglaf his ring and his armour, and bids the manner of his bale-fire."
153,ARGUMENT,With that he passes away. Now the dastards come thereto and find Wiglaf
154,ARGUMENT,vainly bathing his dead lord. He casteth shame upon them with great
155,ARGUMENT,"wrath. Thence he sends a messenger to the barriers of the town, who"
156,ARGUMENT,"comes to the host, and tells them of the death of Beowulf. He tells"
157,ARGUMENT,"withal of the old feud betwixt the Geats and the Swedes, and how these,"
158,ARGUMENT,"when they hear of the death of the king, will be upon them. The warriors"
159,ARGUMENT,"go to look on Beowulf, and find him and the Worm lying dead together."
160,ARGUMENT,"Wiglaf chooses out seven of them to go void the treasure-house, after"
161,ARGUMENT,having bidden them gather wood for the bale-fire. They shove the Worm
162,ARGUMENT,"over the cliff into the sea, and bear off the treasure in wains. Then"
163,ARGUMENT,"they bring Beowulf's corpse to bale, and they kindle it; a woman called"
164,ARGUMENT,"the wife of aforetime, it may be Hygd, widow of Hygelac, bemoans him:"
165,ARGUMENT,"and twelve children of the athelings ride round the bale, and bemoan"
166,ARGUMENT,Beowulf and praise him: and thus ends the poem.

3776,PERSONS AND PLACES,"appears to be part of a Finn epic, of which only the merest fragment,"
3777,PERSONS AND PLACES,"called the _Fight at Finnsburg_, is extant. The following conjectured"
3778,PERSONS AND PLACES,outline of the whole story is based on this fragment and on the Beowulf
3779,PERSONS AND PLACES,"episode; Finn, king of the Frisians, had carried off Hildeburh, daughter"
3780,PERSONS AND PLACES,"of Hoc, probably with her consent. Her father, Hoc, seems to have"
3781,PERSONS AND PLACES,"pursued the fugitives, and to have been slain in the fight which ensued"
3782,PERSONS AND PLACES,"on his overtaking them. After the lapse of some twenty years Hoc's sons,"
3783,PERSONS AND PLACES,"HnÃ¦f and Hengest, are old enough to undertake the duty of avenging their"
3784,PERSONS AND PLACES,"father's death. They make an inroad into Finn's country, and a battle"
3785,PERSONS AND PLACES,"takes place in which many warriors, among them HnÃ¦f and a son of Finn,"
3786,PERSONS AND PLACES,"are killed. Peace is then solemnly concluded, and the slain warriors are"
3787,PERSONS AND PLACES,"burnt. As the year is too far advanced for Hengest to return home, he"
3788,PERSONS AND PLACES,and those of his men who survive remain for the winter in the Frisian
3789,PERSONS AND PLACES,country with Finn. But Hengest's thoughts dwell constantly on the death
3790,PERSONS AND PLACES,"of his brother HnÃ¦f, and he would gladly welcome any excuse to break the"
3791,PERSONS AND PLACES,peace which had been sworn by both parties. His ill-concealed desire for
3792,PERSONS AND PLACES,"revenge is noticed by the Frisians, who anticipate it by themselves"
3793,PERSONS AND PLACES,attacking Hengest and his men whilst they are sleeping in the hall. This
