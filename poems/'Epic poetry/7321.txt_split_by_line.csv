31,PREFACE,
32,PREFACE,This translation of the Nibelungenlied is published with the simple
33,PREFACE,purpose of placing one of the world's great epic poems within the reach
34,PREFACE,of English readers. Translations are at best but poor substitutes for
35,PREFACE,originals. A new translation of a poem implies also a criticism of those
36,PREFACE,that have preceded it. My apology for presenting this new English version
37,PREFACE,of the Nibelungenlied is that none of those hitherto made has reproduced
38,PREFACE,the metrical form of the original. In the hope of making the outlines of
39,PREFACE,"the poem clearer for the modern reader, I have endeavored to supply in"
40,PREFACE,the Introduction a historical background by summing up the results of
41,PREFACE,investigation into its origin and growth. The translation itself was
42,PREFACE,"begun many years ago, when I studied the original under Zarncke in"
43,PREFACE,Leipzig.

119,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA
120,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
121,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,1. Origin of the Saga
122,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
123,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"All the Aryan peoples have had their heroic age, the achievements of"
124,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,which form the basis of later saga. For the Germans this was the period
125,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of the Migrations, as it is called, in round numbers the two hundred"
126,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"years from 400 to 600, at the close of which we find them settled in"
127,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"those regions which they have, generally speaking, occupied ever since."
128,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,During these two centuries kaleidoscopic changes had been taking place in
129,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the position of the various Germanic tribes. Impelled partly by a native
130,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"love of wandering, partly by the pressure of hostile peoples of other"
131,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"race, they moved with astonishing rapidity hither and thither over the"
132,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"face of Europe, generally in conflict with one another or buffeted by the"
133,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Romans in the west and south, and by the Huns in the east. In this stern"
134,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,struggle for existence and search for a permanent place of settlement
135,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,some of them even perished utterly; amid the changing fortunes of all of
136,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,them deeds were performed that fixed themselves in the memory of the
137,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"whole people, great victories or great disasters became the subject of"
138,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,story and song. We need only to recall such names as those of Ermanric
139,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,and Theodoric to remind ourselves what an important part was played by
140,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the Germanic peoples of that Migration Period in the history of Europe.
141,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"During it a national consciousness was engendered, and in it we have the"
142,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,faint beginnings of a national literature. Germanic saga rests almost
143,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"entirely upon the events of these two centuries, the fifth and sixth."
144,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Although we get glimpses of the Germans during the four or five preceding
145,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"centuries, none of the historic characters of those earlier times have"
146,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,been preserved in the national sagas.
147,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
148,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"With these sagas based on history, however, have been mingled in most"
149,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"cases primeval Germanic myths, possessions of the people from prehistoric"
150,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,times. A most conspicuous example of this union of mythical and
151,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"originally historical elements is the Nibelungen saga, out of which grew"
152,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"in course of time the great national epic, the Nibelungenlied."
153,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
154,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"The Nibelungen saga is made up of two parts, on the one hand the mythical"
155,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"story of Siegfried and on the other the story, founded on historic fact,"
156,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,of the Burgundians. When and how the Siegfried myth arose it is
157,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,impossible to say; its origin takes us back into the impenetrable mists
158,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of the unrecorded life of our Germanic forefathers, and its form was"
159,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,moulded by the popular poetic spirit. The other part of the saga is based
160,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,upon the historic incident of the overthrow of the Burgundian kingdom by
161,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the Huns in the year 437. This annihilation of a whole tribe naturally
162,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,impressed itself vividly upon the imagination of contemporaries. Then the
163,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"fact of history soon began to pass over into the realm of legend, and,"
164,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"from causes which can no longer be determined, this tradition of the"
165,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,vanished Burgundians became united with the mythical story of Siegfried.
166,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,This composite Siegfried-Burgundian saga then became a common possession
167,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of the Germanic peoples, was borne with many of them to lands far distant"
168,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"from the place of its origin, and was further moulded by each according"
169,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"to its peculiar genius and surroundings. In the Icelandic Eddas, the"
170,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,oldest of which we have as they were written down in the latter part of
171,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the ninth century, are preserved the earliest records of the form it had"
172,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"taken among the northern Germanic peoples. Our Nibelungenlied, which is"
173,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the chief source of our knowledge of the story as it developed in
174,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Germany, dates from about the year 1200. These two versions, the Northern"
175,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"and the German, though originating in this common source, had diverged"
176,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,very widely in the centuries that elapsed between their beginning and the
177,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,time when the manuscripts were written in which they are preserved. Each
178,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"curtailed, re-arranged, or enlarged the incidents of the story in its own"
179,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,way. The character of the chief actors and the motives underlying what we
180,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,may call the dramatic development assumed widely dissimilar forms. The
181,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,German Nibelungenlied may be read and appreciated as one of the world's
182,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,great epic poems without an acquaintance on the part of the reader with
183,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the Northern version of the saga. In order, however, to furnish the"
184,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,setting for a few episodes that would in that case remain either obscure
185,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"or colorless, and with a view to placing the readers of this translation"
186,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,in a position to judge better the deeper significance of the epic as the
187,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,eloquent narrative of a thousand years of the life of the people among
188,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"whom it grew, the broad outlines of the saga in its Northern form will be"
189,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,given here.
190,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
191,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
192,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,2. The Northern Form of the Saga
193,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
194,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Starting at the middle of the fifth century from the territory about
195,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Worms on the Rhine where the Burgundians were overthrown, the saga soon"
196,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,spread from the Franks to the other Germanic peoples. We have evidence of
197,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,its presence in northern Germany and Denmark. Allusions to it in the
198,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Anglo-Saxon poem, the _Wanderer_, of the seventh century and in the great"
199,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Anglo-Saxon epic _Beowulf_ of a short time later, show us that it had"
200,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,early become part of the national saga stock in England. Among the people
201,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of Norway and Iceland it took root and grew with particular vigor. Here,"
202,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,farthest away from its original home and least exposed to outward
203,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"influences, it preserved on the whole most fully its heathen Germanic"
204,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"character, especially in its mythical part. By a fortunate turn of"
205,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"events, too, the written record of it here is of considerably earlier"
206,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"date than that which we have from Germany. The Eddas, as the extensive"
207,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"collection of early Icelandic poems is called, are the fullest record of"
208,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Germanic mythology and saga that has been handed down to us, and in them"
209,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the saga of Siegfried and the Nibelungen looms up prominently. The
210,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"earliest of these poems date from about the year 850, and the most"
211,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,important of them were probably written down within a couple of centuries
212,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,of that time. They are thus in part some three centuries older than the
213,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"German Nibelungenlied, and on the whole, too, they preserve more of the"
214,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,original outlines of the saga. By bringing together the various episodes
215,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of the saga from the Eddas and the Volsung saga, a prose account of the"
216,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"mythical race of the Volsungs, we arrive at the following narrative."
217,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
218,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"On their wanderings through the world the three gods Odin, Honir, and"
219,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Loki come to a waterfall where an otter is devouring a fish that it has
220,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"caught. Loki kills the otter with a stone, and they take off its skin. In"
221,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the evening they seek a lodging at the house of Hreidmar, to whom they"
222,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"show the skin. Hreidmar recognizes it as that of his son, whom Loki has"
223,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,killed when he had taken on the form of an otter. Assisted by his sons
224,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Fafnir and Regin, Hreidmar seizes the three gods, and spares their lives"
225,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"only on the promise that they will fill the skin, and also cover it"
226,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"outwardly, with gold. Loki is sent to procure the ransom. With a net"
227,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,borrowed from the sea-goddess Ran he catches at the waterfall the dwarf
228,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Andvari in form of a fish and compels him to supply the required gold.
229,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Andvari tries to keep back a ring, but this also Loki takes from him,"
230,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,whereupon the dwarf utters a curse upon the gold and whosoever may
231,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"possess it. The ransom is now paid to Hreidmar; even the ring must, on"
232,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Hreidmar's demand, be given in order to complete the covering of the"
233,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,otter's skin. Loki tells him of the curse connected with the ownership of
234,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the gold. When Hreidmar refuses Fafnir and Regin a share in the treasure,"
235,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"he is killed by Fafnir, who takes possession of the hoard to the"
236,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,exclusion of Regin. In the form of a dragon Fafnir dwells on Gnita Heath
237,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"guarding the hoard, while Regin broods revenge."
238,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
239,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"From Odin is descended King Volsung, who has a family of ten sons and one"
240,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"daughter. The eldest son is Sigmund, twin-born with his sister Signy."
241,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"King Siggeir of Gautland sues for the hand of Signy, whom her father"
242,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,gives to Siggeir against her will. In the midst of King Volsung's hall
243,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,stood a mighty oak-tree. As the wedding-feast is being held there enters
244,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"a stranger, an old man with one eye, his hat drawn down over his face and"
245,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,bearing in his hand a sword. This sword he thrusts to the hilt into the
246,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"tree, saying that it shall belong to him who can draw it out again; after"
247,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,which he disappears as he had come. All the guests try their strength in
248,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"vain upon the sword, but Sigmund alone is able to draw it forth. He"
249,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,refuses to sell it to Siggeir for all his proffered gold. Siggeir plans
250,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"vengeance. He invites Volsung and his sons to Gautland, and returns home"
251,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"thither with his bride Signy, who before going warns her father to be"
252,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,upon his guard.
253,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
254,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,At the appointed time King Volsung and his sons go as invited to
255,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Gautland. In spite of Signy's repeated warning he will not flee from
256,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"danger, and falls in combat with Siggeir; his ten sons are taken"
257,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"prisoners, and placed in stocks in the forest. For nine successive nights"
258,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"a she-wolf comes and devours each night one of them, till only Sigmund"
259,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"remains. By the aid of Signy he escapes. The she-wolf, it was said, was"
260,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the mother of Siggeir.
261,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
262,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"To Sigmund, who has hidden in a wood, Signy sends her eldest boy of ten"
263,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,years that Sigmund may test his courage and see if he is fit to be a
264,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"helper in seeking revenge. Neither he, however, nor his younger brother"
265,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,stands the test. Signy sees that only a scion of the race of Volsung will
266,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"suffice, and accordingly disguises herself and lives three days with"
267,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Sigmund in the wood. From their union a son Sinfiotli is born, whom also,"
268,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"after ten years, she sends out to Sigmund. He stands every test of"
269,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"courage, and is trained by Sigmund, who thinks he is Siggeir's son."
270,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
271,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Bent on revenge, Sigmund repairs with Sinfiotli to Siggeir's castle."
272,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"After Sinfiotli has slain the king's two sons, he and Sigmund are"
273,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"overpowered and condemned to be buried alive. With Sigmund's sword,"
274,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"however, which Signy has managed to place in their hands, they cut their"
275,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"way out, then set fire to Siggeir's hall. Signy comes forth and reveals"
276,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"to Sigmund that Sinfiotli is their own son; and then, saying that her"
277,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"work of revenge is complete and that she can live no longer, she returns"
278,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,into the burning hall and perishes with Siggeir and all his race.
279,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
280,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Sigmund now returns home and rules as a mighty king. He marries Borghild,"
281,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"who later kills Sinfiotli with a poisoned drink, and is cast away by"
282,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Sigmund. He then marries Hjordis. Lyngvi, the son of King Hunding, was"
283,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,also a suitor and now invades Sigmund's land. The latter hews down many
284,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of his enemies, until an old man with one eye, in hat and dark cloak,"
285,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"interposes his spear, against which Sigmund's sword breaks in two."
286,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Sigmund falls severely wounded.
287,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
288,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,In the night Hjordis seeks the scene of the combat and finds Sigmund
289,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"still alive. He refuses to allow her to heal his wounds, saying that Odin"
290,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,no longer wills that he swing the sword. He tells Hjordis to preserve
291,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,carefully the pieces of the broken sword; the son she bears in her womb
292,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"shall yet swing the sword when welded anew, and win thereby a glorious"
293,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"name. At dawn Sigmund dies. Hjordis is borne off by Vikings and, after"
294,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the birth of her son, she becomes the wife of the Danish prince Alf."
295,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
296,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,The son of Hjordis was called Sigurd. He grew up a boy of wondrous
297,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"strength and beauty, with eyes that sparkled brightly, and lived at the"
298,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"court of King Hjalprek, the father of Alf. Regin, the dwarfish brother of"
299,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Fafnir, was his tutor. Regin welds together the pieces of the broken"
300,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"sword Gram, so sharp and strong that with it Sigurd cleaves Regin's anvil"
301,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,in twain. With men and ships that he has received from King Hjalprek
302,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Sigurd goes against the sons of Hunding, whom he slays, thereby avenging"
303,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the death of his father. Regin has urged him to kill Fafnir and take
304,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"possession of the hoard. On the Gnita Heath he digs a ditch from which,"
305,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"as the dragon Fafnir passes over it, he plunges the sword into his heart."
306,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,The dying Fafnir warns him of the curse attached to the possession of the
307,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,gold; also that Regin is to be guarded against. The latter bids him roast
308,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the heart of Fafnir. While doing so he burns his finger by dipping it in
309,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the blood to see if the heart is done, and to cool his finger puts it"
310,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,into his mouth. Suddenly he is able to understand the language of the
311,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"birds in the wood. They warn him to beware of Regin, whom he straightway"
312,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"slays. The birds tell him further of the beautiful valkyrie Brynhild, who"
313,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,sleeps on the fire-encircled mountain awaiting her deliverer. Then Sigurd
314,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"places Fafnir's hoard upon his steed Grani, takes with him also Fafnir's"
315,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"helm, and rides away to Frankenland. He sees a mountain encircled by a"
316,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"zone of fire, makes his way into it and beholds there, as he deems it, a"
317,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,man in full armor asleep. When he takes off the helmet he finds that it
318,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,is a woman. With his sword he cuts loose the armor. The woman wakes and
319,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"asks if it be the hero Sigurd who has awakened her. In joy that it is so,"
320,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Brynhild relates to him how Odin had punished her by this magic sleep for
321,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"disobedience, and how that she had yet obtained from him the promise that"
322,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,she should be wakened only by a hero who knew no fear. She now teaches
323,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Sigurd many wise runes, and tells him of harm to fear through love of"
324,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"her. In spite of all, however, Sigurd does not waver, and they swear an"
325,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,oath of mutual faithful love.
326,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
327,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Next Sigurd comes to King Gjuki at the Rhine, and joins in friendship"
328,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,with him and his sons Gunnar and Hogni. Queen Grimhild gives Sigurd a
329,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,potion which causes him to forget Brynhild and be filled with love for
330,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"her own daughter Gudrun, whom he marries. Gunnar now seeks Brynhild for"
331,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"wife, and Sigurd goes with him on his wooing-journey. They come to the"
332,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"castle encircled by fire, where Brynhild lives. She will be wooed only by"
333,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,him who will ride to her through the flames. Gunnar tries in vain to do
334,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"this, even when mounted on Sigurd's steed Grani. Sigurd and Gunnar then"
335,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,exchange shapes and the former spurs Grani through the flames. He calls
336,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"himself Gunnar the son of Gjuki, and finally Brynhild consents to become"
337,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"his wife. Three nights he shares her couch, but always his sharp sword"
338,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,lies between them. He takes the ring from her finger and places in its
339,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,stead one from Fafnir's treasure. Then he exchanges form again with
340,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Gunnar, who is soon after wedded to Brynhild. Only now does Sigurd"
341,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,recollect the oath that he once swore to Brynhild himself.
342,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
343,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,One day Brynhild and Gudrun are bathing in the Rhine. A quarrel arises
344,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,between them when Brynhild takes precedence of Gudrun by going into the
345,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"water above her in the stream, saying that her husband is a braver and"
346,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,mightier man than Gudrun's. Gudrun retorts by revealing the secret that
347,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"it was Sigurd in Gunnar's form, and not Gunnar himself, who rode through"
348,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the flame, and in proof thereof shows her the ring taken by Sigurd from"
349,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Brynhild's finger. Pale as death, Brynhild goes quietly home: Gunnar must"
350,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"die, she says in wrath. Sigurd tries to pacify her, even offering to"
351,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"desert Gudrun. Now she will have neither him nor another, and when Gunnar"
352,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,appears she demands of him Sigurd's death. In spite of Hogni's protest
353,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Gunnar's stepbrother Gutthorm, who has not sworn blood-friendship with"
354,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Sigurd, is got to do the deed. He is given the flesh of wolf and serpent"
355,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"to eat in order to make him savage. Twice Gutthorm goes to kill Sigurd,"
356,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,but cowers before the piercing glance of his eyes; at last he steals upon
357,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Sigurd asleep and thrusts his sword through him. The dying Sigurd hurls
358,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the sword after the fleeing murderer and cuts him in two. To Gudrun, who"
359,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"wakes from sleep by his side, he points to Brynhild as the instigator of"
360,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the crime, and dies. Brynhild rejoices at the sound of Gudrun's wailing."
361,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Gudrun cannot find relief for her grief, the tears will not flow. Men and"
362,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,women seek to console her by tales of greater woes befallen them. But
363,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,still Gudrun cannot weep as she sits by Sigurd's corpse. At last one of
364,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the women lifts the cloth from Sigurd's face and lays his head upon
365,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Gudrun's lap. Then Gudrun gazes on his blood-besmirched hair, his dimmed"
366,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"eyes, and breast pierced by the sword: she sinks down upon the couch and"
367,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,a flood of tears bursts at length from her eyes.
368,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
369,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Brynhild now tells Gunnar that Sigurd had really kept faith with him on
370,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the wooing journey; but she will live with him no longer and pierces
371,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"herself with a sword, after foretelling to Gunnar his future fate and"
372,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,that of Gudrun. In accord with her own request she is burned on one
373,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"funeral-pyre with Sigurd, the sword between them as once before."
374,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
375,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Atli,[1] king of the Huns, now seeks Gudrun for wife. She refuses, but"
376,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Grimhild gives her a potion which causes her to forget Sigurd and the
377,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"past, and then she becomes the wife of Atli. After Sigurd's death Gunnar"
378,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"had taken possession of the Niflungen hoard, and this Atli now covets. He"
379,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"treacherously invites Gunnar and the others to visit him, which they do"
380,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"in spite of Gudrun's warnings, first of all, however, sinking the hoard"
381,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"in the Rhine. On their arrival Atli demands of them the hoard, which, he"
382,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"says, belongs of right to Gudrun. On their refusal he attacks them. Hosts"
383,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"of fighters on both sides fall and in the end Gunnar and Hogni, the only"
384,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"two of their number remaining, are bound in fetters. Gunnar refuses"
385,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Atli's command to reveal the hiding-place of the hoard, bidding them"
386,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,bring to him the heart of Hogni. They kill a servant and bring his heart
387,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"to Gunnar; but Gunnar sees how it still quivers with fear, and knows it"
388,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"is not the heart of the fearless Hogni. Then the latter is really killed,"
389,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"and his heart is brought to Gunnar, who cries exultingly that now only"
390,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the Rhine knows where the hoard lies hidden. In spite of Gudrun Atli
391,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,orders that Gunnar be thrown into a den of serpents. With a harp
392,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"communicated to him by Gudrun he pacifies them all but one, which stings"
393,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"him to the heart, and thus Gunnar dies. Gudrun is nominally reconciled"
394,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"with Atli, but in secret plans revenge for the death of her brothers. She"
395,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"kills Atli's two sons, gives him at a banquet their blood to drink and"
396,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"their hearts to eat. In the night she plunges a sword into his own heart,"
397,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"confesses herself to him as his murderer, and sets fire to the castle, in"
398,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,which Atli and all his remaining men are consumed.
399,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
400,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"[1] That is, Attila; the Etzel of the Nibelungenlied."
401,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
402,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
403,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,3. The Saga as preserved in the Nibelungenlied
404,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
405,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,The saga as we find it in the German Nibelungenlied differs very widely
406,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,in form and substance from the Northern version which has just been
407,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"outlined, though the two have still enough points of similarity to"
408,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,indicate clearly a common origin. Each bears the stamp of the poetic
409,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,genius of the people among whom it grew. Of all the sagas of the Germanic
410,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"peoples none holds so prominent a place as the Nibelungen saga, and it"
411,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"may safely be said that the epic literature of the world, though offering"
412,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"poems of more refined literary worth, has none that are at the same time"
413,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,such valuable records of the growth of the poetic genius of two kindred
414,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,peoples through many centuries of their early civilization as the Edda
415,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,poems of this saga and the Nibelungenlied. It is impossible here to
416,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,undertake a comparison of the two and point out in detail their
417,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,parallelism and their respective significance as monuments of
418,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,civilization; suffice it to indicate briefly the chief points of
419,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"difference in the two stories, and note particularly those parts of the"
420,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Nibelungenlied that have, as it were, suffered atrophy, and that point to"
421,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"earlier stages of the saga in which, as in the Northern version, they"
422,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,played a more important role.
423,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
424,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"First, as to the hoard. The Nibelungenlied knows nothing of its being"
425,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"taken by Loki from Andvari, of the latter's curse upon it, and how it"
426,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"came finally into the possession of Fafnir, the giant-dragon. Here it"
427,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"belongs, as we learn from Hagen's account (strophes 86-99), to Siegfried"
428,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"(Sigurd), who has slain the previous owners of it, Schilbung and"
429,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Nibelung, and wrested it from its guardian the dwarf Alberich (Andvari)."
430,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,From this point onward its history runs nearly parallel in the two
431,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,versions. After Siegfried's death it remains for a time with Kriemhild
432,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"(Gudrun), is treacherously taken from her by Gunther (Gunnar) and Hagen"
433,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"(Hogni), and finally, before their journey to Etzel (Atli), sunk in the"
434,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Rhine.
435,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
436,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,The protracted narrative of Sigurd's ancestry and his descent from Odin
437,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,has no counterpart in the Nibelungenlied. Here we learn merely that
438,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Siegfried is the son of Siegmund. His father plays an entirely different
439,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"part; and his mother's name is not Hjordis, as in the Edda, but"
440,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Siegelind.
441,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
442,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Of Siegfried's youth the Nibelungenlied knows very little. No mention is
443,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,made of his tutelage to the dwarf smith Regin and preparation for the
444,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,slaying of the dragon Fafnir. The account of him placed in the mouth of
445,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Hagen (strophes 86-501), how he won the hoard, the _tarnkappe_, and the"
446,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"sword Balmung, and slew the dragon, is evidently a faint echo of an"
447,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"earlier version of this episode, which sounds out of place in the more"
448,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,modern German form of the story. From the latter the mythical element has
449,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"almost entirely vanished. It is worthy of note, moreover, that the very"
450,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,brief account of Siegfried's slaying of the dragon is given in the
451,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Nibelungenlied as separate from his acquisition of the hoard, and differs"
452,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"in detail from that of the Edda. Of Sigurd's steed Grani, his ride to"
453,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Frankenland, and his awakening of Brynhild the Nibelungenlied has nothing"
454,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,to tell us. Through the account of Siegfried's assistance to Gunther in
455,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the latter's wooing of Brunhild (Adventures 6 and 7) shimmers faintly,"
456,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"however, the earlier tradition of the mythical Siegfried's awakening of"
457,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the fire-encircled valkyrie. Only by our knowledge of a more original
458,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"version can we explain, for example, Siegfried's previous acquaintance"
459,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,with Brunhild which the Nibelungenlied takes for granted but says nothing
460,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,of. On this point of the relation between Sigurd and Brynhild it is
461,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,difficult to form a clear account owing to the confusion and even
462,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,contradictions that exist when the various Northern versions themselves
463,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,are placed side by side. The name of the valkyrie whom Sigurd awakens
464,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,from her magic sleep is not directly mentioned. Some of the accounts are
465,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,based on the presupposition that she is one with the Brynhild whom Sigurd
466,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"later wooes for Gunnar, while others either know nothing of the sleeping"
467,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,valkyrie or treat the two as separate personages. The situation in the
468,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Nibelungenlied is more satisfactorily explained by the theory that they
469,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,were originally identical. But we see at once that the figure of Brunhild
470,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,has here lost much of its original significance. It is her quarrel with
471,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Kriemhild (Gudrun) that leads to Siegfried's death, though the motives"
472,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,are not just the same in the two cases; and after the death of Siegfried
473,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,she passes unaccountably from the scene.
474,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
475,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"But it is in the concluding part of the story--the part which, as we"
476,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"shall see, has its basis in actual history--that the two accounts diverge"
477,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"most widely. So strange, indeed, has been the evolution of the saga that"
478,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the central character of it, Kriemhild (Gudrun) holds a diametrically"
479,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,opposite relation to her husband Etzel (Atli) at the final catastrophe in
480,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the two versions. In the Nibelungenlied as in the Edda the widowed
481,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Kriemhild (Gudrun) marries King Etzel (Atli), her consent in the former"
482,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"resulting from a desire for revenge upon the murderers of Siegfried, in"
483,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the latter from the drinking of a potion which takes away her memory of
484,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,him; in the Nibelungenlied it is Kriemhild who treacherously lures
485,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Gunther and his men to their destruction unknown to Etzel, in the Edda"
486,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the invitation comes from Atli, while Gudrun tries to warn them to stay"
487,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,at home; in the former Kriemhild is the author of the attack on the
488,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"guests, in the latter Atli; in the former Kriemhild is the frenzied"
489,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"avenger of her former husband Siegfried's death upon her brother Gunther,"
490,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,in the latter Gudrun is the avenger of her brothers' death upon her
491,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,husband Atli.
492,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
493,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
494,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,4. Mythical Element and Historical Element
495,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
496,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,A sifting of the Nibelungen saga reveals a mythical element (the story of
497,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Siegfried) and a historical element (the story of the Burgundians and
498,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Etzel). How, when, and where these two elements were blended together"
499,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,must remain largely a matter of conjecture. This united central body
500,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"received then from time to time accessions of other elements, some of"
501,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"them originally historical in character, some of them pure inventions of"
502,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the poetic imagination.
503,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
504,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"The Siegfried myth is the oldest portion of the Nibelungen saga, and had"
505,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,already passed through a long period of development before its union with
506,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the story of the Burgundian kings. Like so many others of its kind, it is"
507,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,part of the spiritual equipment of our Germanic ancestors at the dawn of
508,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,their recorded history. It grew gradually with the people themselves and
509,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,has its counterpart among other peoples. Such myths are a record of the
510,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,impressions made upon the mind of man by the mighty manifestations of the
511,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,world of nature in which he lives; their formation may be likened to the
512,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,unconscious impressions of its surroundings on the mind of the child. And
513,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,just as the grown man is unable to trace back the formation of his own
514,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"individuality to its very beginnings in infancy, so is it impossible for"
515,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the later nation in its advanced stage to peer back beyond the dawn of
516,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,its history. It is in the gloom beyond the dawn that such myths as this
517,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,of Siegfried have their origin.
518,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
519,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Though modern authorities differ greatly in their conjectures, it is"
520,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,generally agreed that the Siegfried story was in its original form a
521,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,nature-myth. The young day slays the mist-dragon and awakens the
522,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,sun-maiden that sleeps on the mountain; at evening he falls a prey to the
523,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,powers of gloom that draw the sun down again beneath the earth. With this
524,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,day-myth was probably combined the parallel myth of the changing seasons:
525,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the light returns in spring, slays the cloud-dragon, and frees the"
526,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,budding earth from the bonds of winter.[2]
527,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
528,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,[2] For the Siegfried saga in general see Symons in Paul's Grundriss der
529,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"germanischen Philologie, 2d ed., vol. III, pp. 651-671."
530,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
531,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,In the course of time this nature-myth became transformed into a
532,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,hero-saga; the liberating power of light was humanized into the person of
533,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the light-hero Siegfried. This stage of development had already been
534,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"reached at the time of our earliest records, and the evidences point to"
535,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the Rhine Franks, a West Germanic tribe settled in the fifth century in"
536,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the country about Cologne, as the people among whom the transformation"
537,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"from nature-myth to hero-saga took place, for it is among them that the"
538,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"saga in its earliest form is localized. By the Rhine Siegfried is born,"
539,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"there he wins the Nibelungen hoard, and in Frankenland he finds the"
540,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"sleeping valkyrie. By the Rhine, too, he enters into service with the"
541,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Nibelungen kings and weds their sister.
542,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
543,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,The Franks had as neighbors up-stream in the first half of the fifth
544,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"century the Burgundians, an East Germanic tribe. These Burgundians, who"
545,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"were closely allied to the Goths, had originally dwelt in the Baltic"
546,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"region between the Vistula and the Oder, whence they had made their way"
547,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,south westward across Germany and settled in the year 413 in _Germania
548,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,prima_ on the west bank of the Rhine about Worms. Here a tragic fate was
549,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,soon to overtake them. In the year 435 they had already suffered a
550,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"reverse in a conflict with the Romans under Aetius, and two years later,"
551,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"in 437, they were practically annihilated by the Huns. Twenty thousand of"
552,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"them, we are told, fell in battle, the remainder were scattered"
553,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"southward. Beyond the brief record by a contemporary, Prosper, we know"
554,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,but little of this event. It has been conjectured that the Huns were on
555,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,this occasion acting as auxiliaries of Aetius. At any rate it is fairly
556,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,certain that Attila was not personally on the scene.
557,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
558,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,We can easily imagine what a profound impression this extinction of the
559,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Burgundians would produce upon the minds of their neighbors the Rhine
560,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Franks. Fact, too, would soon become mingled with fiction. This new feat"
561,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"was ascribed to Attila himself, already too well known as the scourge of"
562,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Europe and the subduer of so many German tribes. A very few years later,"
563,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"however, fate was to subdue the mighty conqueror himself. With the great"
564,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"battle of Chalons in 451 the tide turned against him, and two years"
565,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,afterwards he died a mysterious death. The historian Jordanes of the
566,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,sixth century relates that on the morning after Attila's wedding with a
567,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,German princess named Ildico (Hildiko) he was found lying in bed in a
568,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"pool of blood, having died of a hemorrhage. The mysteriousness of"
569,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Attila's ending inspired his contemporaries with awe, and the popular"
570,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,fancy was not slow to clothe this event also in a dress of fiction. The
571,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,attendant circumstances peculiarly favored such a process. Historians
572,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,soon recorded the belief that Attila had perished at the hands of his
573,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"wife, and it was only a step further for the imagination to find the"
574,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,motive for the deed in the desire of Hildiko to avenge the death of her
575,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,German kinsmen who had perished through Attila. The saga of Attila's
576,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"death is before long connected with the growing Burgundian saga, Hildiko"
577,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"becomes the sister of the Burgundian kings Gundahari, Godomar, and"
578,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Gislahari, and her deed is vengeance taken upon Attila for his"
579,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,destruction of her brothers. As is seen at once from the outline I have
580,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"already given (Chapter 2.) of the saga as we find it in the Edda, this is"
581,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the stage of development it had reached when it began to find its way
582,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,northward from the Rhine country to Norway and Iceland.
583,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
584,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,It is unnecessary here to record the speculations--for beyond
585,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,speculations we cannot go--as to how the union of this historical saga of
586,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the Burgundians and Attila with the Siegfried saga took place. In the
587,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"course of time, and naturally with greatest probability among the Rhine"
588,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Franks who followed the Burgundians as occupants of _Germania prima_, the"
589,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"two were brought together, and the three Burgundian kings and their"
590,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,sister were identified with the three Nibelungen kings and their sister
591,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,of the already localized Siegfried saga. It is also beyond the scope of
592,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,this introduction to follow the course of the saga northward or to note
593,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,its further evolution during its wanderings and in its new home until it
594,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,was finally recorded in poetic form in the Edda. We have now to consider
595,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,briefly the transformation it passed through in Germany between this date
596,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,(about 500) and the time (about 1200) when it emerges in written record
597,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,as the Nibelungenlied.
598,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
599,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,An account has already been given (Chapter 3.) of the chief features in
600,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"which the Nibelungenlied differs from the Northern form. As we saw there,"
601,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,the mythical element of the Siegfried saga has almost entirely evaporated
602,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,and the historical saga of the Burgundian kings and Attila has undergone
603,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,a complete transformation. That the originally mythical and heathen
604,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Siegfried saga should dwindle away with the progress of civilization and
605,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,under the influence of Christianity was but natural. The character of the
606,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"valkyrie Brynhild who avenges upon Sigurd his infidelity to her, yet"
607,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"voluntarily unites herself with him in death, as heathen custom demanded,"
608,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"is no longer intelligible. She recedes into the background, and after"
609,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Siegfried's death, though she is still living, she plays no further part."
610,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"The Nibelungenlied found its final form on Upper German, doubtless"
611,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Austrian, territory. Here alone was it possible that that greatest of all"
612,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"transformations could take place, namely, in the character of Attila. The"
613,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Franks of the Rhine knew him only as the awe-inspiring conqueror who had
614,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,annihilated their neighbors the Burgundians. In Austrian lands it was
615,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"quite otherwise. Many Germanic tribes, particularly the East Goths, had"
616,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"fought under the banner of Attila, and in the tradition handed down from"
617,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,them he lived as the embodiment of wisdom and generosity. Here it was
618,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,impossible that epic story should picture him as slaying the Burgundian
619,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,kings through a covetous desire for their gold. The annihilation of the
620,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Burgundians is thus left without a motive. To supply this, Kriemhild's"
621,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,character is placed upon an entirely different basis. Instead of avenging
622,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"upon Attila the death of her brothers the Burgundian kings, Kriemhild now"
623,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,avenges upon her brothers the slaying of her first husband Siegfried.
624,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,This fundamental change in the character of Kriemhild has a deep ethical
625,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,reason. To the ancient heathen Germans the tie of blood-relationship was
626,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"stronger than that of wedlock, and thus in the original version of the"
627,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,story Attila's wife avenges upon him the death of her _brothers_; to the
628,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Christianized Germans of later times the marriage bond was the stronger,"
629,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,and accordingly from the altered motive Kriemhild avenges upon her
630,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"brothers the slaying of her _husband_. In accordance, too, with this"
631,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,ethical transformation the scene of the catastrophe is transferred from
632,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Worms to Attila's court. Kriemhild now looms up as the central figure of
633,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"the second half of the drama, while Etzel remains to the last ignorant of"
634,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,her designs for revenge.
635,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
636,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,This transformation of the fundamental parts of the saga was accompanied
637,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"by another process, namely, the addition of new characters. Some of these"
638,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,are the product of the poetic faculty of the people or individuals who
639,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"preserved and remoulded the story in the course of centuries, others are"
640,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"based upon history. To the former class belong the Margrave Ruediger, the"
641,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"ideal of gentle chivalry, and Volker the Fiddler-knight, doubtless a"
642,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,creation of the _spielleute_. To the second class belong Dietrich of
643,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"Bern, in whom we see the mighty East Gothic king, Theodoric of Verona;"
644,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"also Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, a very late importation, besides several"
645,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,others in whom are perpetuated in more or less faint outline actual
646,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,persons of history. This introduction of fresh characters from time to
647,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"time as the saga grew has led to some strange anachronisms, which however"
648,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"are a disturbing element only to us readers of a modern day, who with"
649,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,sacrilegious hand lift the veil through which they were seen in a uniform
650,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,haze of romance by the eye of the knights and ladies of seven centuries
651,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"ago. _They_ neither knew nor cared to know, for instance, that Attila was"
652,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"dead before Theodoric was born, and that Bishop Pilgrim flourished at"
653,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,Passau the trifling space of five hundred years later still.[3]
654,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
655,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,
656,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"[3] Attila lived from about 406 to 453; Theodoric, 475 to 526. Pilgrim"
657,I. THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA,"was Bishop of Passau, 971 to 991."

665,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
666,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Among the German epic poems of the Middle Ages the Nibelungenlied [4]
667,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"enjoyed an exceptional popularity, as is evident from the large number of"
668,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"manuscripts--some thirty, either complete or fragmentary--that have been"
669,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,preserved from the centuries immediately following its appearance. Three
670,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"are of prime importance as texts, namely, those preserved now in Munich,"
671,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"St. Gall, and Donaueschingen, and cited as A, B, and C respectively."
672,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Since the time when Lachmann, about a century ago, made the first"
673,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"scientific study of the poem, a whole flood of writings has been poured"
674,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,forth discussing the relative merits of these texts. Each in turn has had
675,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,its claims advocated with warmth and even acrimony. None of these three
676,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"principal manuscripts, however, offers the poem in its earliest form;"
677,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,they all point to a still earlier version. It is now generally admitted
678,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"that the St. Gall manuscript (B), according to which the present"
679,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"translation has been made, contains the best and most nearly original"
680,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,text.
681,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
682,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"[4] The closing strophe of MS. C calls the poem der _Nibelunge liet_, or"
683,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Nibelungenlied, i.e. the lay of the Nibelungen, and this is the title"
684,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,by which it is commonly known. MSS. A and B have in the corresponding
685,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"strophe _der Nibelunge not_, i.e. the 'need', 'distress',"
686,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,'downfall' of the Nibelungen. In the title of the poem 'Nibelungen'
687,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,is simply equivalent to 'Burgundians': the poem relates the downfall
688,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of the Burgundian kings and their people. Originally the Nibelungen
689,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"were, as their name, which is connected with _nebel_, 'mist',"
690,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"'gloom', signifies, the powers of darkness to whom the light-hero"
691,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Siegfried fell a prey. After Siegfried obtains possession of the
692,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,treasure the name Nibelungen is still applied to Alberich and the
693,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,dwarfs who guard it and who are now Siegfried's vassals. Then after
694,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Siegfried's death the name is given to the Burgundians. It is a
695,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,mistake to suppose that the name was applied in each case to those
696,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"who became possessors of the hoard, for Siegfried himself is never so"
697,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,designated.

700,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,2. Stages in the Evolution of the Poem
701,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
702,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Hand in hand with the discussion of the relative authenticity of the
703,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,manuscripts went the consideration of another more important literary
704,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"question,--the evolution of the poem itself. Even if we knew nothing of"
705,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the history of the Nibelungen saga as revealed in the Edda and through
706,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"other literary and historic sources, a reading of the poem would give us"
707,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"unmistakable hints that it is not, in its present form, a perfect"
708,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,literary unit. We detect inconsistencies in matter and inequalities of
709,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,style that prove it to be a remodelling of material already existing in
710,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"some earlier form. What, then, has been the history of its evolution? How"
711,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"did this primeval Siegfried myth, this historical saga of the Burgundians"
712,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"and Attila, first come to be part of the poetic stock of the German"
713,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"people? What was its earliest poetic form, and what series of"
714,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,transformations did it pass through during seven centuries of growth?
715,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"These and many kindred questions present themselves, and the search for"
716,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,answers to them takes us through many winding labyrinths of the nation's
717,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,contemporary history. Few products of German literature have so exercised
718,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and tantalized critics as the Nibelungenlied.
719,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
720,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In this connection we have to remind ourselves that comparatively little
721,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of what must have been the large body of native poetry in Germany
722,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,previous to the eleventh century has come down to us. Barely enough has
723,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,been preserved to show the path of the nation's literary progress. Some
724,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"of the important monuments have been saved by chance, while others of"
725,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,equal or perhaps greater value have been irrecoverably lost. The interest
726,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,in the various incidents of the Nibelungen story was sufficient to keep
727,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,it alive among the people and hand it down orally through many
728,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,generations. If we could observe it as it passed from age to age we
729,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,should doubtless see it undergoing continuous change according to the
730,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,time and the class of the people that were the preservers of the native
731,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,literature in its many ups and downs. Lachmann in the year 1816 was the
732,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,first to bring scientific criticism to bear on the question of the
733,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Nibelungenlied and its origin. Applying to it the same methods as had
734,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"recently been used by Wolf in his criticism of the Homeric poems, he"
735,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,thought he was able to discover as the basis of the complete epic a cycle
736,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"of twenty separate _lieder_, ballads or shorter episodic poems, on the"
737,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,strength of which belief he went so far as to publish an edition of the
738,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,poem in which he made the division into the twenty separate lays and
739,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,eliminated those strophes (more than one third of the whole number) that
740,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"he deemed not genuine. It is now generally admitted, however, that the"
741,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,pioneer of Nibelungen investigation fell here into over-positive
742,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,refinements of literary criticism. Separate shorter poems there doubtless
743,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"existed narrating separate episodes of the story, but these are no longer"
744,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,to be arrived at by a process of critical disintegration and pruning of
745,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the epic as we have it. An examination of the twenty _lieder_ according
746,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,to Lachmann's division convinces us that they are not separate units in
747,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the sense he conceived them to be. Though these twenty _lieder_ may be
748,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"based upon a number of earlier episodic poems, yet the latter already"
749,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,constituted a connected series. They were already like so many scenes of
750,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,a gradually developing drama. Events were foreshadowed in one that were
751,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"only fulfilled in another, and the incidents of later ones are often only"
752,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,intelligible on the supposition of an acquaintance with motives that
753,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"originated in preceding ones. It is in this sense only, not according to"
754,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Lachmann's overwrought theory, that we are justified in speaking of a"
755,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"_liedercyclus_, or cycle of separate episodic poems, as the stage of the"
756,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,epic antecedent to the complete form in which we now have it. But beyond
757,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,this cycle we cannot trace it back. How the mythical saga of Siegfried
758,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"and the Nibelungen, and the story of the Burgundians and Attila, were"
759,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"first sung in alliterative lays in the Migration Period, how as heathen"
760,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,song they were pushed aside or slowly influenced by the spirit of
761,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Christianity, how with changing time they changed also their outward"
762,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"poetical garb from alliteration to rhyme and altered verse-form, till at"
763,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,last in the twelfth century they have become the cycle of poems from
764,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,which the great epic of the Nibelungenlied could be constructed--of all
765,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,this we may form a faint picture from the development of the literature
766,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"in general, but direct written record of it is almost completely wanting."

769,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,3. Character of the Poem
770,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
771,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,The twelfth and thirteenth centuries witnessed far-reaching changes in
772,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the social and intellectual life of the German lands, the leading feature"
773,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of which is the high development of all that is included under the name
774,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"of chivalry. It is marked, too, by a revival of the native literature"
775,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"such as had not been known before, a revival which is due almost entirely"
776,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,to its cultivation by the nobility. From emperor down to the simple
777,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"knight they were patrons of poetry and, what is most striking, nearly all"
778,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the poets themselves belong to the knightly class. The drama has not yet
779,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"begun, but in the field of epic and lyric there appear about the year"
780,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,1200 poets who are among the greatest that German literature even down to
781,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the present time has to show. The epic poetry of that period, though"
782,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"written almost entirely by the knights, is of two distinct kinds"
783,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"according to its subject: on the one hand what is called the Court Epic,"
784,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"on the other hand the National, or Popular, Epic. The Court Epic follows"
785,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,for the most part French models and deals chiefly with the life of
786,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"chivalry, whose ideals were embodied in king Arthur and his circle of"
787,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,knights; the National Epic drew its subjects from the national German
788,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"saga, its two great products being the Nibelungenlied and the poem of"
789,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Gudrun. Court Epic and National Epic are further distinct in form, the"
790,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Court Epic being written in the rhymed couplets popularized in modern
791,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"times in English by Sir Walter Scott, while the National Epic is composed"
792,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,in four-lined strophes.
793,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
794,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Though we know the name and more or less of the life of the authors of
795,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the many court epics of the period, the name of the poet who gave the"
796,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Nibelungenlied its final form has not been recorded. As we have seen, the"
797,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"poem is at bottom of a truly popular, national character, having its"
798,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,beginnings in mythology and early national history. For centuries the
799,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,subject had been national property and connected with the name of no one
800,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,individual. We have it now in the form in which it was remodelled to suit
801,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the taste of the court and the nobility, and like the court epic to be"
802,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,read aloud in castle hall. That it is written in four-lined strophes[5]
803,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and not in the usual rhymed couplets of the court epics is doubtless due
804,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,to the fact that the former verse-form had already been used in the
805,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"earlier ballads upon which it is based, and was simply taken over by the"
806,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,final moulder of the poem. This latter was probably a member of the
807,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,nobility like the great majority of the epic poets of the time; he must
808,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"at least have been well acquainted with the manners, tastes, sentiments,"
809,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and general life of the nobility. Through him the poem was brought
810,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,outwardly more into line with the literary ideals of the court circles.
811,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"This shows itself chiefly in a negative way, namely, in the almost"
812,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,complete avoidance of the coarse language and farcical situations so
813,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"common with the popular poet, the _spielmann_. Beyond this no violence is"
814,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,done to the simple form of the original. The style is still inornate and
815,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"direct, facts still speak rather than words, and there is nothing"
816,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,approaching the refined psychological dissection of characters and
817,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,motives such as we find in Wolfram von Eschenbach and the other court
818,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,writers.

822,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,When we look to the inner substance we see that the ground ideals are
823,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,still those of the original Germanic heroic age. The chief characters are
824,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"still those of the first stages of the story--Siegfried, Brunhild,"
825,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Gunther, Kriemhild, Hagen. The fundamental theme is the ancient theme of"
826,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"_triuwe_, unswerving personal loyalty and devotion, which manifests"
827,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,itself above all in the characters of Kriemhild and Hagen. Kriemhild's
828,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,husband Siegfried is treacherously slain: her sorrow and revenge are the
829,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"motives of the drama. Hagen's mistress has, though with no evil intent on"
830,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Siegfried's part, received an insult to her honor: to avenge that insult"
831,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"is Hagen's absorbing duty, which he fulfils with an utter disregard of"
832,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,consequences. Over this their fundamental character the various persons
833,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of the story have received a gloss of outward conduct in keeping with the
834,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,close of the twelfth century. The poet is at pains to picture them as
835,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"models of courtly bearing, excelling in _hofscheit_, _zuht_, _tugent_."
836,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Great attention is paid to dress, and the preparation of fitting apparel"
837,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,for court festivities is described and re-described with wearisome
838,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"prolixity. A cardinal virtue is _milte_, liberality in the bestowal of"
839,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,gifts. Courtesy toward women is observed with the careful formality of
840,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the age of the minnesingers. It was above all Siegfried, the light-hero"
841,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"of the original myth, whose character lent itself to an idealization of"
842,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,knighthood. Ruediger holds a like place in the latter part of the poem.
843,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In the evident pleasure with which the minstrel-knight Volker of the
844,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"sword-fiddlebow is depicted, as well doubtless as in occasional gleams of"
845,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"broader humor, the hand of the minstrels who wrought on the story in its"
846,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"earlier ballad stages may be seen. And the whole poem, in keeping with"
847,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"its form in an age strongly under church influence, has been tinged with"
848,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the ideals of Christianity. Not only does the ordinary conversation of
849,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"all the characters, including even the heathen Etzel, contain a great"
850,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"number of formal imprecations of God, but Christian institutions and"
851,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Christian ethics come frequently into play. Mass is sung in the minster,"
852,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"baptism, marriage, burial are celebrated in Christian fashion, the devil"
853,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"is mentioned according to the Christian conception, we hear of priest,"
854,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"chaplain, and bishop, Christians are contrasted with heathen, and"
855,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Kriemhild, in marrying Etzel, has a hope of turning him to Christianity."
856,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In Hagen's attempt to drown the chaplain whom the Burgundians have with
857,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,them as they set out for the land of the Huns we have perhaps an
858,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,expression of the conflict between the heathen and the Christian
859,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"elements, possibly also a reflection of the traditional animosity of the"
860,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,_spielmann_ to his clerical rival.
861,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
862,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"The Nibelungenlied and the Iliad of Homer have often been compared, but"
863,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,after all to no great purpose. The two epics are alike in having their
864,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"roots deep in national origins, but beyond this we have contrasts rather"
865,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,than resemblances. The Iliad is a more varied and complete picture of the
866,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"whole Greek world than the Nibelungenlied is of the German, its religious"
867,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,atmosphere has not been disturbed in the same way as that of the saga of
868,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,early Germanic times projected several centuries into a later Christian
869,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"age, and it possesses in every way a greater unity of sentiment. In the"
870,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"varied beauty of its language, its wealth of imagery, its depth of"
871,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,feeling and copiousness of incident the Iliad is superior to the
872,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Nibelungenlied with its language of simple directness, its few lyrical"
873,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"passages, its expression of feeling by deeds rather than by words. Homer,"
874,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"too, is in general buoyant, the Nibelungenlied is sombre and stern. And"
875,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,in one last respect the two epics differ most of all: the Iliad is
876,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"essentially narrative and descriptive, a series of episodes; the"
877,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Nibelungenlied is essentially dramatic, scene following scene of dramatic"
878,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,necessity and pointing steadily to a final and inevitable catastrophe.

882,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
883,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In the Northern Edda and in the German Nibelungenlied the Nibelungen saga
884,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,found its fullest and most poetic expression. But these were not to be
885,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the only literary records of it. Both in Scandinavian lands and in
886,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Germany various other monuments, scattered over the intervening"
887,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"centuries, bear witness to the fact that it lived on in more or less"
888,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,divergent forms. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus of the latter part
889,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of the twelfth century has a reference to the story of Kriemhild's
890,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,treachery toward her brothers. About the year 1250 an extensive prose
891,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"narrative, known as the Thidrekssaga, was written by a Norwegian from"
892,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,oral accounts given him by men from Bremen and Munster. This narrative is
893,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,interesting as showing the form the saga had taken by that date on Low
894,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"German territory, and holds an important place in the history of the"
895,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,development of the saga. It has much more to say of the early history of
896,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Siegfried than we find in the Nibelungenlied, and yet in the main"
897,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,outlines of the story of Kriemhild's revenge it corresponds with the
898,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,German epic and not with the Northern Edda. A chronicle of the island of
899,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Hven in the Sound, dating in its original form from the sixteenth"
900,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"century, as well as Danish ballads on the same island that have lived on"
901,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"into modern times, tell of Sivard (Siegfried), Brynhild, and also of"
902,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Grimild's (Kriemhild's) revenge. In Norway and Sweden traces of the saga
903,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,have recently been discovered; while songs that are sung on the Faroe
904,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Islands, as an accompaniment to the dance on festive occasions, have been"
905,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"recorded, containing over six hundred strophes in which is related in"
906,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,more or less distorted form the Nibelungen story.
907,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
908,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In Germany the two poems known as the _Klage_ and _Hurnen Seyfrid_ are
909,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the most noteworthy additional records of the Nibelungen saga, as"
910,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,offering in part at least independent material. The _Klage_ is a poem of
911,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"over four thousand lines in rhymed couplets, about half of it being an"
912,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"account of the mourning of Etzel, Dietrich, and Hildebrand as they seek"
913,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"out the slain and prepare them for burial, the other half telling of the"
914,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"bringing of the news to Bechlaren, Passau, and Worms. The poem was"
915,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"written evidently very soon after the Nibelungenlied, the substance of"
916,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"which was familiar to the author, though he also draws in part from other"
917,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,sources. Compared with the Nibelungenlied it possesses but little poetic
918,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,merit and is written with distinctly Christian sentiment which is out of
919,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,harmony with the ground-tone of the Germanic tragedy.
920,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
921,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,The _Hurnen Seyfrid_ is a poem of 179 four-lined strophes which is
922,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"preserved only in a print of the sixteenth century, but at least a"
923,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,portion of whose substance reaches back in its original form to a period
924,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"preceding the composition of the Nibelungenlied. It is evidently, as we"
925,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"have it, formed by the union of two earlier separate poems, which are"
926,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,indeed to a certain extent contradictory of each other. The first tells
927,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of the boyhood of Seyfrid (Siegfried) and his apprenticeship to the
928,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"smith; how he slew many dragons, burned them, and smeared over his body"
929,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"with the resulting fluid horny substance (hence his name _hurnen_), which"
930,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,made him invulnerable; how he further found the hoard of the dwarf
931,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Nybling, and by service to King Gybich won the latter's daughter for his"
932,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,wife. The second part tells how King Gybich reigned at Worms. He has
933,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"three sons, Gunther, Hagen, Gyrnot, and one daughter, Kriemhild. The"
934,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"latter is borne off by a dragon, but finally rescued by Seyfrid, to whom"
935,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,she is given in marriage. The three brothers are jealous of the might and
936,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"fame of Seyfrid, and after eight years Hagen slays him beside a cool"
937,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,spring in the Ottenwald.
938,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
939,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"The poem _Biterolf_, written soon after the Nibelungenlied, and"
940,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"_Rosengarten_ of perhaps a half-century later, represent Dietrich in"
941,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,conflict with Siegfried at Worms. The famous shoemaker-poet Hans Sachs of
942,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Nuremberg in 1557 constructed a tragedy, _Der hornen Sewfriedt_, on the"
943,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,story of Siegfried as he knew it from the _Hurnen Seyfrid_ and the
944,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"_Rosengarten_. A prose version of the _Hurnen Seyfrid_, with free"
945,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"additions and alterations, is preserved in the _Volksbuch vom gehornten"
946,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Sigfrid_, the oldest print of which dates from the year 1726. Of the vast"
947,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"number of Fairy Tales, those most genuine creations of the poetic"
948,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"imagination of the people, in which live on, often to be sure in scarcely"
949,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"recognizable form, many of the myths and sagas of the nation's infancy,"
950,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,there are several that may with justice be taken as relics of the
951,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Siegfried myth, for instance, The Two Brothers, The Young Giant, The"
952,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Earth-Manikin, The King of the Golden Mount, The Raven, The Skilled"
953,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Huntsman, and perhaps also the Golden Bird and The Water of Life;[6]"
954,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,though it would seem from recent investigations that Thorn-Rose or the
955,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Sleeping Beauty, is no longer to be looked upon as the counterpart of the"
956,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"sleeping Brynhild. Finally, it is probable that several names in Germany"
957,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and in Northern countries preserve localized memories of the saga.

965,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
966,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Fundamentally different from the foregoing natural outgrowths of the
967,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Nibelungen saga are the modern dramas and poems founded upon it since the
968,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,time of the romanticists at the beginning of the nineteenth century.[7]
969,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Nearly all of these have already vanished as so much chaff from the
970,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"winnowing-mill of time: only two, perhaps, are now considered seriously,"
971,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"namely, Hebbel's _Die Nibelungen_ and Richard Wagner's _Ring des"
972,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Nibelungen_. Hebbel in his grandly conceived drama in three parts follows
973,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"closely the story as we have it in our epic poem the Nibelungenlied, and"
974,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the skill with which he makes use of its tragic elements shows his
975,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,dramatic genius at its best. But not even the genius of Hebbel could make
976,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"these forms of myth and saga live again for us upon a modern stage, and"
977,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the failure of this work with its wealth of poetic beauty and many scenes
978,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of highest dramatic effectiveness to maintain its place as an acting
979,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,drama is sufficient evidence that the yawning gap that separates the
980,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,sentiment of the modern world from that of the early centuries in which
981,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"these sagas grew is not to be bridged over by the drama, however easy and"
982,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,indeed delightful it may be for us to allow ourselves to be transported
983,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,thither to that romantic land upon the wings of epic story. Wagner in his
984,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,music-drama in three parts and prelude has followed in the main the saga
985,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"in its Northern form [8] up to the death of Siegfried and Brunhild, but"
986,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,to the entire exclusion of the latter part of the story in which Atli
987,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,(Etzel) figures; his work has accordingly hardly any connection with the
988,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Nibelungenlied here offered in translation. Only the pious loyalty of
989,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,national sentiment can assign a high place in dramatic literature to
990,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Wagner's work with its intended imitation of the alliterative form of
991,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,verse; while his philosophizing gods and goddesses are also but decadent
992,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,modern representatives of their rugged heathen originals.

1001,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,The language of the Nibelungenlied presents about the same difficulty to
1002,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the German reader of to-day as that of our English Chaucer to us. Many
1003,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,translations into modern German have accordingly been made to render it
1004,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,accessible to the average reader without special study. In the year 1767
1005,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Bodmer in Zurich published a translation into hexameters of a portion of
1006,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"it, and since the investigations of Lachmann raised it to the position of"
1007,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"a national epic of first magnitude many more have appeared, both in prose"
1008,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"and verse. The best in prose is that by Scherr, of the year 1860. Of the"
1009,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"metrical translations that by Simrock, which in its later editions"
1010,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"follows pretty closely the text of MS. C, is deservedly the most popular"
1011,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and has passed through a great number of editions. Bartsch has also made
1012,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,a translation based on his edition of MS. B. These modern versions by
1013,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Simrock and Bartsch reproduce best the metrical quality of the original
1014,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,strophe. Easily obtainable recent translations are those by Junghans (in

1032,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"in England, contributed to the Westminster Review in 1831 his well-known"
1033,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"essay on the Nibelungenlied which, though containing an additional mass"
1034,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"of rather ill-arranged matter and now antiquated in many particulars, is"
1035,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,still well worth reading for its enthusiastic account of the epic itself
1036,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,in the genuine style of the author. Carlyle here reproduces in metrical
1037,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,form a few strophes. He has said elsewhere that one of his ambitions was
1038,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,to make a complete English version of the poem. Since then an endless
1039,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"number of accounts of it, chiefly worthless, has appeared in magazines"
1040,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and elsewhere. The first attempt at a complete metrical translation was
1041,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"made in 1848 by Jonathan Birch, who however only reproduces Lachmann's"
1042,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"twenty _lieder_, with some fifty-one strophes added on his own account."
1043,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,His version of the first strophe runs thus:
1044,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
1045,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Legends of by-gone times reveal wonders and prodigies,"
1046,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of heroes worthy endless fame,--of matchless braveries,--"
1047,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of jubilees and festal sports,--of tears and sorrows great,--"
1048,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,And knights who daring combats fought:--the like I now relate.

1050,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In 1850 appeared William Nansom Lettsom's translation of the whole poem
1051,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"according to Braunfels' edition, with the opening strophe turned as"
1052,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,follows:
1053,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
1054,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,In stories of our fathers high marvels we are told
1055,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Of champions well approved in perils manifold.
1056,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of feasts and merry meetings, of weeping and of wail,"

1059,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,The next metrical rendering is that by A. G. Foster-Barham in the year
1060,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,1887. His first strophe reads:
1061,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
1062,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Many a wondrous story have the tales of old,"
1063,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of feats of knightly glory, and of the Heroes bold,"
1064,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of the delights of feasting, of weeping and of wail,"

1069,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,is prefaced by Carlyle's essay. First strophe:
1070,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
1071,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"To us, in olden legends, / is many a marvel told"
1072,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of praise-deserving heroes, / of labours manifold,"
1073,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Of weeping and of wailing, / of joy and festival;"
1074,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Of bold knights' battling shall you / now hear a wondrous tale.
1075,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
1076,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Apart from the many faults of interpretation all of the metrical
1077,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,translations of the Nibelungenlied here enumerated are defective in one
1078,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,all-important respect: they do not reproduce the poem in its _metrical
1079,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,form_. Carlyle and other pioneers we may perhaps acquit of any intention
1080,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,of following the original closely in this regard. None of the translators
1081,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"of the complete poem, however, has retained in the English rendering what"
1082,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"is after all the very essence of a poem,--its exact metrical quality."
1083,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Birch has created an entirely different form of strophe in which all four

1086,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,attempt to reproduce the original strophe. It is evident from the
1087,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,introduction to his translation (see p. xxvi) that he had made a careful
1088,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"study of its form, and he does in fact reproduce the first three lines"
1089,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"exactly. Of the fourth line he says: ""I have not thought it expedient to"
1090,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"make a rule of thus lengthening the fourth lines of the stanzas, though I"
1091,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"have lengthened them occasionally""(!). What moved him thus to deprive"
1092,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the stanza of its most striking feature--and one, moreover, that is"
1093,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,easily preserved in English--he does not make clear. The versions of
1094,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"Foster-Barham and of Horton and Bell show the same disfigurement, the"
1095,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"latter omitting the extra accent of the fourth line, as they say, ""for"
1096,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"the sake of euphony""(!). It is just this lengthened close of each strophe"
1097,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,that gives the Nibelungenlied its peculiar metrical character and
1098,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,contributes not a little to the avoidance of monotony in a poem of over
1099,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,two thousand strophes. In theory the form of the fourth line as it stands
1100,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,in the original is no more foreign to the genius of the English language
1101,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"than to that of modern German, and few of the many Germans giving a"
1102,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,modernized version of the epic have been bold enough to lay sacrilegious
1103,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,hands upon it to shorten it.
1104,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,
1105,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"A brief account of the Nibelungen strophe may not be out of place here,"
1106,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,owing to the fact that its character has generally been misunderstood.
1107,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,The origin and evolution of the strophe have been the subject of much
1108,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"discussion, the results of which we need not pause to formulate here. As"
1109,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"it appears in actual practice in our poem of about the year 1200, it was"
1110,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"as follows: Each strophe consists of four long lines, the first line"
1111,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"rhyming with the second, and the third with the fourth. The rhymes are"
1112,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"masculine, that is, rhymes on the end syllable. Each line is divided by a"
1113,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,clearly marked caesura into two halves; each half of the first three
1114,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"lines and the first half of the fourth line has three accented syllables,"
1115,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the second half of the fourth line has four accented syllables. The first
1116,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"half of each line ends in an unaccented syllabic--or, strictly speaking,"
1117,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"in a syllable bearing a secondary accent; that is, each line has what is"
1118,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"called a ""ringing"" caesura. The metrical character of the Nibelungen"
1119,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,strophe is thus due to its fixed number of accented syllables. Of
1120,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,unaccented syllables the number may vary within certain limits.
1121,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Ordinarily each accented syllable is preceded by an unaccented one; that
1122,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"is, the majority of feet are iambic. The unaccented syllable may,"
1123,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"however, at times be wanting, or there may, on the other hand, be two or"
1124,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,even three of them together. A characteristic of the second half of the
1125,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,last line is that there is very frequently no unaccented syllable between
1126,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the second and the third accented ones. Among occasional variations of
1127,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the normal strophe as here described may be mentioned the following: The
1128,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,end-rhyme is in a few instances feminine instead of masculine; while on
1129,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,the other hand the ending of the first half-lines is occasionally
1130,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"masculine instead of feminine, that is, the caesura is not ""ringing."" In"
1131,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,a few scattered instances we find strophes that rhyme throughout in the
1132,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,caesura as well as at the end of lines;[10] occasionally the first and
1133,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"second lines, or still less frequently the third and fourth, alone have"
1134,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,caesural rhyme.[11] Rhyming of the caesura may be regarded as accidental
1135,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"in most cases, but it is reproduced as exactly as possible in this"
1136,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,translation.

1153,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,Here the only place where the unaccented syllable is lacking before the
1154,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,accented is before _wunders_ at the beginning of the second half of the
1155,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"first line. A strophe showing more typical irregularities is, for"
1156,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"instance, the twenty-second:"

1164,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,and _sagen_ being pronounced _tagn_ and _sagn_. The unaccented syllable
1165,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"is lacking, e.g., before the second accent of the second half of line"
1166,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"two, also before the first and the third accent of the second half of"
1167,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,line four. There are two unaccented syllables at the beginning

1170,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"half of the fourth line of a strophe, as here, is so frequent in the poem"
1171,II. THE NIBELUNGENLIED,"as to amount almost to a rule; it shows an utter misconception, or"

1424,SECOND ADVENTURE,"Against the high midsummer, / when Siegfried won the name of knight."
1425,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1426,SECOND ADVENTURE,32
1427,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1428,SECOND ADVENTURE,Then went unto the minster / full many a noble knight
1429,SECOND ADVENTURE,And gallant squires beside them. / The elder there with right
1430,SECOND ADVENTURE,"Did wait upon the younger, / as once for them was done."
1431,SECOND ADVENTURE,"They were all light-hearted, / in hope of pleasure every one."
1432,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1433,SECOND ADVENTURE,33
1434,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1435,SECOND ADVENTURE,God to praise and honor / they sang the mass' song;
1436,SECOND ADVENTURE,"There, too, were crowds of people, / a great and surging throng,"
1437,SECOND ADVENTURE,"When after knightly custom / knighthood received they then,"
1438,SECOND ADVENTURE,In such a stately pageant / as scarce might ever be again.
1439,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1440,SECOND ADVENTURE,34
1441,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1442,SECOND ADVENTURE,They hastened where they found them / saddled many a steed;
1443,SECOND ADVENTURE,In the court of Siegmund's castle / they tilted with such speed
1444,SECOND ADVENTURE,"That far the din resounded / through castle and through hall,"
1445,SECOND ADVENTURE,As in the play with clamor / did join the fiery riders all.
1446,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1447,SECOND ADVENTURE,35
1448,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1449,SECOND ADVENTURE,"Well-tried old knights and youthful / met there in frequent clash,"
1450,SECOND ADVENTURE,"There was sound of shattered lances / that through the air did crash,"
1451,SECOND ADVENTURE,And along before the castle / were splinters seen to fly
1452,SECOND ADVENTURE,From hands of knights a many: / each with other there did vie.

1458,SECOND ADVENTURE,And many a stone full costly / lay there upon the sward
1459,SECOND ADVENTURE,"From erstwhile shining shield-bands, / now broken in the jousting hard."
1460,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1461,SECOND ADVENTURE,37
1462,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1463,SECOND ADVENTURE,The guests all went thereafter / where seats for them were reared;
1464,SECOND ADVENTURE,"They by the choicest viands / from weariness were cheered,"
1465,SECOND ADVENTURE,"And wine, of all the rarest, / that then in plenty flowed."
1466,SECOND ADVENTURE,Upon both friends and strangers / were fitting honors rich bestowed.
1467,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1468,SECOND ADVENTURE,38
1469,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1470,SECOND ADVENTURE,In such merry manner / all day did last the feast.
1471,SECOND ADVENTURE,"Many a wandering minstrel / knew not any rest,"
1472,SECOND ADVENTURE,But sang to win the presents / dealt out with bounteous hand;
1473,SECOND ADVENTURE,And with their praise was honored / far and wide King Siegmund's land.

1479,SECOND ADVENTURE,"To all his sword-companions / he gave with such full hand,"
1480,SECOND ADVENTURE,That joyed they o'er the journey / they now had made unto that land.
1481,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1482,SECOND ADVENTURE,40
1483,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1484,SECOND ADVENTURE,The festival yet lasted / until the seventh day.
1485,SECOND ADVENTURE,Siegelind after old custom / in plenty gave away
1486,SECOND ADVENTURE,--For so her son she honored-- / rich gifts of shining gold:
1487,SECOND ADVENTURE,In sooth deserved she richly / that all should him in honor hold.
1488,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1489,SECOND ADVENTURE,41
1490,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1491,SECOND ADVENTURE,Never a wandering minstrel / was unprovided found:
1492,SECOND ADVENTURE,"Horses there and raiment / so free were dealt around,"
1493,SECOND ADVENTURE,As if to live they had not / beyond it one day more.
1494,SECOND ADVENTURE,I ween a monarch's household / ne'er bestowed such gifts before.
1495,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1496,SECOND ADVENTURE,42
1497,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1498,SECOND ADVENTURE,"Thus closed the merry feasting / in this right worthy way,"
1499,SECOND ADVENTURE,And 't was well known thereafter / how those good knights did say
1500,SECOND ADVENTURE,That they the youthful hero / for king would gladly have;
1501,SECOND ADVENTURE,"But this nowise he wished for, / Siegfried the stately knight and brave."
1502,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1503,SECOND ADVENTURE,43
1504,SECOND ADVENTURE,
1505,SECOND ADVENTURE,"While that they both were living, / Siegmund and Siegelind,"
1506,SECOND ADVENTURE,"No crown their son desired, / --thereto he had no mind."
1507,SECOND ADVENTURE,Yet would he fain be master / o'er all the hostile might
1508,SECOND ADVENTURE,That in the lands around him / opposed the keen and fiery knight.

1519,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Seldom in sooth, if ever, / the hero's heart was sad."
1520,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"He heard them tell the story, / how that a winsome maid"
1521,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"There lived afar in Burgundy, / surpassing fair to see:"
1522,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Great joy she brought him later, / but eke she brought him misery."
1523,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1524,THIRD ADVENTURE.,45
1525,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1526,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Of her exceeding beauty / the fame spread far and near,"
1527,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"And of the thing, moreover, / were knights oft-times aware"
1528,THIRD ADVENTURE.,How the maid's high spirit / no mortal could command:
1529,THIRD ADVENTURE.,The thing lured many a stranger / from far unto King Gunther's land.
1530,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1531,THIRD ADVENTURE.,46
1532,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1533,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Although to win her favor / were many wooers bent,"

1535,THIRD ADVENTURE.,That any one amongst them / for lover she would have:
1536,THIRD ADVENTURE.,Still to her was he a stranger / to whom anon her troth she gave.
1537,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1538,THIRD ADVENTURE.,47
1539,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1540,THIRD ADVENTURE.,To true love turned his fancy / the son of Siegelind.
1541,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"'Gainst his, all others' wooing / was like an idle wind:"
1542,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Full well did he merit / a lady fair to woo,"
1543,THIRD ADVENTURE.,And soon the noble Kriemhild / to Siegfried bold was wedded true.
1544,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1545,THIRD ADVENTURE.,48
1546,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1547,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"By friends he oft was counselled, / and many a faithful man,"
1548,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Since to think of wooing / in earnest he began,"
1549,THIRD ADVENTURE.,That he a wife should find him / of fitting high degree.
1550,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Then spoke the noble Siegfried: / ""In sooth fair Kriemhild shall it be,"

1552,THIRD ADVENTURE.,49
1553,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1554,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"""The noble royal maiden / in Burgundy that dwells,"

1564,THIRD ADVENTURE.,That his son intent was / the full stately maid to woo.
1565,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1566,THIRD ADVENTURE.,51
1567,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1568,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Siegelind asked and learned it, / the noble monarch's wife."
1569,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"For her loved son she sorrowed / lest he should lose his life,"

1572,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1573,THIRD ADVENTURE.,52

1712,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1713,THIRD ADVENTURE.,72
1714,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1715,THIRD ADVENTURE.,New-made shields they carried / that were both strong and wide

1718,THIRD ADVENTURE.,Of knights before was never / beheld so richly clad a band.
1719,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1720,THIRD ADVENTURE.,73

1728,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1729,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Reins with gold all gleaming / held they in the hand,"

1733,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1734,THIRD ADVENTURE.,75
1735,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1736,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Gallant men high-hearted, / knight and squire too,"

1758,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"""If that the king thou seekest, / right soon may he be found."

1769,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1770,THIRD ADVENTURE.,80
1771,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1772,THIRD ADVENTURE.,Thereat the king did wonder / whence were come to him
1773,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"These knights adventure seeking / in dress so bright and trim,"
1774,THIRD ADVENTURE.,And shields adorned so richly / that new and mighty were.
1775,THIRD ADVENTURE.,That none the thing could tell him / did grieve him sorely to hear.
1776,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1777,THIRD ADVENTURE.,81
1778,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1779,THIRD ADVENTURE.,"Outspake a knight then straightway, / Ortwein by name was he,"

1790,THIRD ADVENTURE.,
1791,THIRD ADVENTURE.,83
1792,THIRD ADVENTURE.,

2221,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Now shall ye let me know it,"" / spake the monarch keen."
2222,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then dreaded they full sorely / to see King Gunther's angry mien.
2223,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2224,FOURTH ADVENTURE,143
2225,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2226,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""Wilt them, O king, permit us / the tidings straight to tell"
2227,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"That we now have brought thee, / no whit will we conceal,"

2238,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2239,FOURTH ADVENTURE,145
2240,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2241,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""Within weeks a dozen / their march will they begin;"

2257,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Have I yet warriors faithful, / from these I'll naught conceal,"
2258,FOURTH ADVENTURE,But to my friends I'll straightway / these warlike tidings strange

2262,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2263,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The lordly Gunther wondered / thereat and troubled sore,"
2264,FOURTH ADVENTURE,As he the message pondered / in heart and brooded o'er.
2265,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"He sent to fetch grim Hagen / and others of his men,"
2266,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And bade likewise in hurry / to court bring hither Gernot then.
2267,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2268,FOURTH ADVENTURE,149
2269,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2270,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Thus at his word his trusted / advisers straight attend.
2271,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"He spake: ""Our land to harry / foes all unknown will send"

2281,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2282,FOURTH ADVENTURE,151

2289,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2290,FOURTH ADVENTURE,152
2291,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2292,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The messengers in the borough / were harbored well the while,"
2293,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And though their sight was hateful, / in hospitable style"
2294,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"As his own guests to tend them / King Gunther gave command,"

2297,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2298,FOURTH ADVENTURE,153
2299,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2300,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The king was filled with sorrow / and his heart was sad.

2302,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Who could not well imagine / what 'twas that grieved him so.
2303,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then begged he of King Gunther / the tale of this his grief to know.
2304,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2305,FOURTH ADVENTURE,154
2306,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2307,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""To me it is great wonder,"" / said Siegfried to the king,"

2321,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"He spake unto the monarch: / ""To thee I've naught denied."

2340,FOURTH ADVENTURE,159

2388,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2389,FOURTH ADVENTURE,166

2395,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2396,FOURTH ADVENTURE,167
2397,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2398,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"When to their native Denmark / the messengers returned,"

2417,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2418,FOURTH ADVENTURE,170

2433,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2434,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"To march they quick made ready. / And when they thence would fare,"

2459,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2460,FOURTH ADVENTURE,176

2462,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then from the Rhine through Hesse / the hosts of knights rode on
2463,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Toward the land of Saxons, / where battle was anon."
2464,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"With fire and sword they harried / and laid the country waste,"
2465,FOURTH ADVENTURE,So that both the monarchs / full well the woes of war did taste.
2466,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2467,FOURTH ADVENTURE,177
2468,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2469,FOURTH ADVENTURE,When came they to the border / the train-men onward pressed.
2470,FOURTH ADVENTURE,With thought of battle-order / Siegfried the thanes addressed:
2471,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""Who now shall guard our followers / from danger in the rear?"""
2472,FOURTH ADVENTURE,In sooth like this the Saxons / in battle worsted never were.
2473,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2474,FOURTH ADVENTURE,178

2480,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2481,FOURTH ADVENTURE,179

2484,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And against our enemies / will keep watch in the van,"
2485,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Till I aright discover / where they perchance may be."""
2486,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The son of fair Queen Siegelind / did arm him then immediately.

2492,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Into the land of Saxons / alone he rode away,"
2493,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And by his hand was severed / many a helmet's band that day.
2494,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2495,FOURTH ADVENTURE,181
2496,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2497,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"He found a mighty army / that lay athwart the plain,"
2498,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Small part of which outnumbered / all those in his own train:
2499,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Full forty thousand were they / or more good men of might.
2500,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The hero high in spirit / saw right joyfully the sight.
2501,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2502,FOURTH ADVENTURE,182
2503,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2504,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then had eke a warrior / from out the enemy
2505,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"To guard the van gone forward, / all armed cap-a-pie."
2506,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Him saw the noble Siegfried, / and he the valiant man;"
2507,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Each one straight the other / to view with angry mien began.
2508,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2509,FOURTH ADVENTURE,183
2510,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2511,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Who he was I'll tell you / that rode his men before,"
2512,FOURTH ADVENTURE,--A shield of gold all shining / upon his arm he bore--
2513,FOURTH ADVENTURE,In sooth it was King Luedegast / who there the van did guard.
2514,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Straightway the noble Siegfried / full eagerly against him spurred.
2515,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2516,FOURTH ADVENTURE,184
2517,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2518,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Now singled out for combat / him, too, had Luedegast."
2519,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then full upon each other / they spurred their chargers fast,"
2520,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"As on their shields they lowered / their lances firm and tight,"
2521,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Whereat the lordly monarch / soon found himself in sorry plight.
2522,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2523,FOURTH ADVENTURE,185
2524,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2525,FOURTH ADVENTURE,After the shock their chargers / bore the knights so fast
2526,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Onward past each other / as flew they on the blast.
2527,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then turned they deftly backward / obedient to the rein,"
2528,FOURTH ADVENTURE,As with their swords contested / the grim and doughty fighters twain.
2529,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2530,FOURTH ADVENTURE,186
2531,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2532,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"When Siegfried struck in anger / far off was heard the blow,"
2533,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And flew from off the helmet, / as if 'twere all aglow,"
2534,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The fiery sparks all crackling / beneath his hand around.
2535,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Each warrior in the other / a foeman worth his mettle found.
2536,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2537,FOURTH ADVENTURE,187
2538,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2539,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Full many a stroke with vigor / dealt eke King Luedegast,"
2540,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And on each other's buckler / the blows fell thick and fast.
2541,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then thirty men discovered / their master's sorry plight:
2542,FOURTH ADVENTURE,But ere they came to help him / had doughty Siegfried won the fight.
2543,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2544,FOURTH ADVENTURE,188
2545,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2546,FOURTH ADVENTURE,With three mighty gashes / which he had dealt the king
2547,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Through his shining breastplate / made fast with many a ring.
2548,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The sword with sharpest edges / from wounds brought forth the blood,"
2549,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Whereat King Luedegast / apace fell into gloomy mood.
2550,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2551,FOURTH ADVENTURE,189
2552,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2553,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"To spare his life he begged him, / his land he pledged the knight,"
2554,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And told him straight moreover, / that Luedegast he hight."
2555,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then came his knights to help him, / they who there had seen"
2556,FOURTH ADVENTURE,How that upon the vanguard / fierce fight betwixt the twain had been.
2557,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2558,FOURTH ADVENTURE,190
2559,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2560,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"After duel ended, / did thirty yet withstand"
2561,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Of knights that him attended; / but there the hero's hand
2562,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Kept safe his noble captive / with blows of wondrous might.
2563,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And soon wrought greater ruin / Siegfried the full gallant knight.
2564,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2565,FOURTH ADVENTURE,191
2566,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2567,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Beneath his arm of valor / the thirty soon lay dead.
2568,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"But one the knight left living, / who thence full quickly sped"
2569,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To tell abroad the story / how he the others slew;
2570,FOURTH ADVENTURE,In sooth the blood-red helmet / spake all the hapless tidings true.
2571,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2572,FOURTH ADVENTURE,192
2573,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2574,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then had the men of Denmark / for all their grief good cause,"
2575,FOURTH ADVENTURE,When it was told them truly / their king a captive was.
2576,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"They told it to King Luedeger, / when he to rage began"
2577,FOURTH ADVENTURE,In anger all unbounded: / for him had grievous harm been done.
2578,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2579,FOURTH ADVENTURE,193
2580,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2581,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The noble King Luedegast / was led a prisoner then
2582,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"By hand of mighty Siegfried / back to King Gunther's men,"
2583,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And placed in hands of Hagen: / and when they did hear
2584,FOURTH ADVENTURE,That 'twas the king of Denmark / they not a little joyful were.
2585,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2586,FOURTH ADVENTURE,194

2602,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To horse then hastened Gernot / and with him mighty men.
2603,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Volker keen in battle / took up the banner then;
2604,FOURTH ADVENTURE,He was a doughty Fiddler / and rode the host before.
2605,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"There, too, every follower / a stately suit of armor wore."
2606,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2607,FOURTH ADVENTURE,197
2608,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2609,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"More than a thousand warriors / they there had not a man,"
2610,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Saving twelve knights-errant. / To rise the dust began
2611,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"In clouds along the highway / as they rode across the fields,"
2612,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And gleaming in the sunlight / were seen the brightly shining shields.
2613,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2614,FOURTH ADVENTURE,198
2615,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2616,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Meanwhile eke was nearing / of Saxons a great throng,"
2617,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Each a broadsword bearing / that mickle was and long,"
2618,FOURTH ADVENTURE,With blade that cut full sorely / when swung in strong right hand.
2619,FOURTH ADVENTURE,'Gainst strangers were they ready / to guard their castles and their
2620,FOURTH ADVENTURE,land.
2621,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2622,FOURTH ADVENTURE,199
2623,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2624,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The leaders forth to battle / led the warriors then.
2625,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Come was also Siegfried / with his twelve chosen men,"
2626,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Whom he with him hither / had brought from Netherland.
2627,FOURTH ADVENTURE,That day in storm of battle / was blood-bespattered many a hand.
2628,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2629,FOURTH ADVENTURE,200
2630,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2631,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Sindold and Hunold / and Gernot as well,"
2632,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Beneath their hands in battle / full many a hero fell,"
2633,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Ere that their deeds of valor / were known throughout the host.
2634,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Through them must many a stately / matron weep for warrior lost.
2635,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2636,FOURTH ADVENTURE,201
2637,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2638,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Volker and Hagen / and Ortwein in the fight
2639,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Lustily extinguished / full many a helmet's light
2640,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"With blood from wounds down flowing,-- / keen fighters every one."
2641,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And there by Dankwart also / was many a mickle wonder done.
2642,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2643,FOURTH ADVENTURE,202
2644,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2645,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The knights of Denmark tested / how they could weapons wield.
2646,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Clashing there together / heard ye many a shield
2647,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And 'neath sharp swords resounding, / swung by many an arm."
2648,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The Saxons keen in combat / wrought 'mid their foes a grievous harm.
2649,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2650,FOURTH ADVENTURE,203
2651,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2652,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"When the men of Burgundy / pressed forward to the fight,"
2653,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Gaping wounds full many / hewed they there with might.
2654,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then flowing down o'er saddle / in streams was seen the blood,"
2655,FOURTH ADVENTURE,So fought for sake of honor / these valiant riders keen and good.
2656,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2657,FOURTH ADVENTURE,204
2658,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2659,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Loudly were heard ringing, / wielded by hero's hand,"
2660,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The sharply-cutting weapons, / where they of Netherland"
2661,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Their master followed after / into the thickest throng:
2662,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Wherever Siegfried led them / rode too those valiant knights along.
2663,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2664,FOURTH ADVENTURE,205
2665,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2666,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Of warriors from Rhine river / could follow not a one.
2667,FOURTH ADVENTURE,There could be seen by any / a stream of blood flow down
2668,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"O'er brightly gleaming helmet / 'neath Siegfried's mighty hand,"
2669,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Until King Luedeger / before him with his men did stand.
2670,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2671,FOURTH ADVENTURE,206
2672,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2673,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Three times hither and thither / had he the host cut through
2674,FOURTH ADVENTURE,From one end to the other. / Now come was Hagen too
2675,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Who helped him well in battle / to vent his warlike mood.
2676,FOURTH ADVENTURE,That day beneath his valor / must die full many a rider good.
2677,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2678,FOURTH ADVENTURE,207
2679,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2680,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"When the doughty Luedeger / Siegfried there found,"
2681,FOURTH ADVENTURE,As he swung high in anger / his arm for blows around
2682,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And with his good sword Balmung / knights so many slew,"
2683,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Thereat was the keen warrior / filled with grief and anger too.
2684,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2685,FOURTH ADVENTURE,208
2686,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2687,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then mickle was the thronging / and loud the broadswords clashed,"
2688,FOURTH ADVENTURE,As all their valiant followers / 'gainst one another dashed.
2689,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then struggled all the fiercer / both sides the fight to win;
2690,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The hosts joined with each other: / 'twas frightful there to hear the
2691,FOURTH ADVENTURE,din.
2692,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2693,FOURTH ADVENTURE,209
2694,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2695,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"To the monarch of the Saxons / it had been told before,"
2696,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"His brother was a captive, / which grieved his heart right sore."
2697,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"He knew not that had done it / fair Siegelind's son,"
2698,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For rumor said 'twas Gernot. / Full well he learned the truth anon.
2699,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2700,FOURTH ADVENTURE,210
2701,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2702,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"King Luedeger struck so mighty / when fierce his anger rose,"
2703,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"That Siegfried's steed beneath him / staggered from the blows,"
2704,FOURTH ADVENTURE,But forthwith did recover; / then straight his rider keen
2705,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Let all his furious mettle / in slaughter of his foes be seen.
2706,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2707,FOURTH ADVENTURE,211
2708,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2709,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"There helped him well grim Hagen, / and Gernot in the fray,"
2710,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Dankwart and Volker; / dead many a knight there lay.
2711,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Sindold and Hunold / and Ortwein, doughty thane,"
2712,FOURTH ADVENTURE,By them in that fierce struggle / was many a valiant warrior slain.
2713,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2714,FOURTH ADVENTURE,212
2715,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2716,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Unparted in storm of battle / the gallant leaders were,"
2717,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Around them over helmet / flew there many a spear
2718,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Through shield all brightly shining, / from hand of mighty thane:"
2719,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And on the glancing armor / was seen full many a blood-red stain.
2720,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2721,FOURTH ADVENTURE,213
2722,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2723,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Amid the hurly-burly / down fell many a man
2724,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To ground from off his charger. / Straight 'gainst each other ran
2725,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried the keen rider / and eke King Luedeger.
2726,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then flew from lance the splinters / and hurled was many a pointed spear.
2727,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2728,FOURTH ADVENTURE,214
2729,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2730,FOURTH ADVENTURE,'Neath Siegfried's hand so mighty / from shield flew off the band.
2731,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And soon to win the victory / thought he of Netherland
2732,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Over the valiant Saxons, / of whom were wonders seen."
2733,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Heigh-ho! in shining mail-rings / many a breach made Dankwart keen!
2734,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2735,FOURTH ADVENTURE,215
2736,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2737,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Upon the shining buckler / that guarded Siegfried's breast
2738,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Soon espied King Luedeger / a painted crown for crest;
2739,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"By this same token knew he / it was the doughty man,"
2740,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And to his friends he straightway / amid the battle loud began:
2741,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2742,FOURTH ADVENTURE,216
2743,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2744,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""Give o'er from fighting further, / good warriors every one!"
2745,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Amongst our foes now see I / Siegmund's noble son,"
2746,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Of netherland the doughty / knight on victory bent.
2747,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Him has the evil Devil / to scourge the Saxons hither sent."""
2748,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2749,FOURTH ADVENTURE,217
2750,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2751,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then bade he all the banners / amid the storm let down.
2752,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Peace he quickly sued for: / 'Twas granted him anon,"
2753,FOURTH ADVENTURE,But he must now a hostage / be ta'en to Gunther's land.
2754,FOURTH ADVENTURE,This fate had forced upon him / the fear of Siegfried's mighty hand.
2755,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2756,FOURTH ADVENTURE,218
2757,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2758,FOURTH ADVENTURE,They thus by common counsel / left off all further fight.
2759,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Hacked full many a helmet / and shields that late were bright
2760,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"From hands down laid they weary; / as many as there might be,"
2761,FOURTH ADVENTURE,With stains they all were bloody / 'neath hands of the men of Burgundy.
2762,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2763,FOURTH ADVENTURE,219
2764,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2765,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Each whom he would took captive, / now they had won the fight."
2766,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Gernot, the noble hero, / and Hagen, doughty knight,"
2767,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Bade bear forth the wounded. / Back led they with them then
2768,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Unto the land of Burgundy / five hundred stalwart fighting-men.
2769,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2770,FOURTH ADVENTURE,220
2771,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2772,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The knights, of victory cheated, / their native Denmark sought,"
2773,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Nor had that day the Saxons / with such high valor fought,"
2774,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"That one could praise them for it, / which caused the warriors pain."
2775,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Then wept their friends full sorely / at home for those in battle slain.
2776,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2777,FOURTH ADVENTURE,221
2778,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2779,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For the Rhine then laden / they let their armor be.
2780,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Siegfried, the knight so doughty, / had won the victory"
2781,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"With his few chosen followers; / that he had nobly done,"
2782,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Could not but free acknowledge / King Gunther's warriors every one.
2783,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2784,FOURTH ADVENTURE,222
2785,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2786,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"To Worms sent Gernot riding / now a messenger,"
2787,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And of the joyous tiding / soon friends at home were ware,"
2788,FOURTH ADVENTURE,How that it well had prospered / with him and all his men.
2789,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Fought that day with valor / for honor had those warriors keen.
2790,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2791,FOURTH ADVENTURE,223
2792,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2793,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The messenger sped forward / and told the tidings o'er.
2794,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then joyfully they shouted / who boded ill before,"
2795,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To hear the welcome story / that now to them was told.
2796,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"From ladies fair and noble / came eager questions manifold,"
2797,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2798,FOURTH ADVENTURE,224
2799,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2800,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Who all the fair fortune / of King Gunther's men would know.
2801,FOURTH ADVENTURE,One messenger they ordered / unto Kriemhild to go.
2802,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"But that was done in secret: / she durst let no one see,"
2803,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For he was 'mongst those warriors / whom she did love so faithfully.
2804,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2805,FOURTH ADVENTURE,225
2806,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2807,FOURTH ADVENTURE,When to her own apartments / was come the messenger
2808,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Joyfully addressed him / Kriemhild the maiden fair:
2809,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""But tell me now glad tidings, / and gold I'll give to thee,"
2810,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And if thou tell'st not falsely, / good friend thou'lt ever find in me."

2817,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the messenger truly: / ""No knight but did high valor show."

2821,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""But in the dire turmoil / rode rider none so well,"

2839,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And weep aloud must women / for friends by his strong arm laid low.
2840,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2841,FOURTH ADVENTURE,230

2988,FOURTH ADVENTURE,251
2989,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2990,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"""I'll grant you both your freedom,"" / spake the king again;"

2994,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2995,FOURTH ADVENTURE,252
2996,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
2997,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Sweet rest then found the weary / their tired limbs to aid,"
2998,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And gently soon on couches / the wounded knights were laid;
2999,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Mead and wine right ruddy / they poured out plenteously:
3000,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Than they and all their followers / merrier men there none might be.
3001,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3002,FOURTH ADVENTURE,253
3003,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3004,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Their shields all hacked in battle / secure were laid away;
3005,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And not a few of saddles / stained with blood that day,"
3006,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Lest women weep to see them, / hid they too from sight."
3007,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Full many a keen rider / home came aweary from the fight.
3008,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3009,FOURTH ADVENTURE,254
3010,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3011,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The host in gentlest manner / did his guests attend:
3012,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The land around with stranger / was crowded, and with friend."
3013,FOURTH ADVENTURE,They bade the sorely wounded / nurse with especial care:
3014,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Whereby the knights high-hearted / 'neath all their wounds knew not
3015,FOURTH ADVENTURE,despair.
3016,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3017,FOURTH ADVENTURE,255
3018,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3019,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Who there had skill in healing / received reward untold,"
3020,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Silver all unweighed / and thereto ruddy gold
3021,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For making whole the heroes / after the battle sore.
3022,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To all his friends the monarch / gave presents rich in goodly store.
3023,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3024,FOURTH ADVENTURE,256
3025,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3026,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Who there again was minded / to take his homeward way
3027,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"They bade, as one a friend doth, / yet a while to stay."
3028,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The king did then take counsel / how to reward each one,"
3029,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For they his will in battle / like liegemen true had nobly done.
3030,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3031,FOURTH ADVENTURE,257
3032,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3033,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Then outspake royal Gernot: / ""Now let them homeward go;"
3034,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"After six weeks are over, / --thus our friends shall know--"
3035,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To hold high feast they're bidden / hither to come again;

3037,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3038,FOURTH ADVENTURE,258
3039,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3040,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Of Netherland the hero / would also then take leave.
3041,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"When of this King Gunther / did tidings first receive,"
3042,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The knight besought he kindly / not yet his leave to take:
3043,FOURTH ADVENTURE,To this he'd ne'er consented / an it were not for Kriemhild's sake.
3044,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3045,FOURTH ADVENTURE,259
3046,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3047,FOURTH ADVENTURE,A prince he was too noble / to take the common pay;
3048,FOURTH ADVENTURE,He had right well deserved it / that the king alway
3049,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"And all his warriors held him / in honor, for they had seen"
3050,FOURTH ADVENTURE,What by his arm in battle / bravely had accomplished been.
3051,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3052,FOURTH ADVENTURE,260
3053,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3054,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"He stayed there yet a little / for the maiden's sake alone,"
3055,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Whom he would see so gladly. / And all fell out full soon
3056,FOURTH ADVENTURE,As he at heart had wished it: / well known to him was she.
3057,FOURTH ADVENTURE,Home to his father's country / joyously anon rode he.
3058,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3059,FOURTH ADVENTURE,261
3060,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3061,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"The king bade at all seasons / keep up the tournament,"
3062,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And many a youthful rider / forth to the lists there went.
3063,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The while were seats made ready / by Worms upon the strand
3064,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For all who soon were coming / unto the Burgundian land.
3065,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3066,FOURTH ADVENTURE,262
3067,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3068,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"In the meantime also, / ere back the knights returned,"
3069,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Had Kriemhild, noble lady, / the tidings likewise learned,"
3070,FOURTH ADVENTURE,The king would hold high feasting / with all his gallant men.
3071,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"There was a mickle hurry, / and busy were fair maidens then"

3079,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3080,FOURTH ADVENTURE,264
3081,FOURTH ADVENTURE,
3082,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Such love she bore her children / she bade rich dress prepare,"
3083,FOURTH ADVENTURE,"Wherewith adorned were ladies / and many a maiden fair,"
3084,FOURTH ADVENTURE,And not a few young riders / in the land of Burgundy.
3085,FOURTH ADVENTURE,For strangers many bade she / rich garments eke should measured be.

3094,FIFTH ADVENTURE,265
3095,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3096,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Unto the Rhine now daily / the knights were seen to ride,"

3098,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"To all that thither journeyed / to the king to show them true,"

3100,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3101,FIFTH ADVENTURE,266

3106,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then vied with one another / to deck themselves the ladies all.
3107,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3108,FIFTH ADVENTURE,267
3109,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3110,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Never was seen idle / the young Prince Giselher:
3111,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The guests and all their followers / received full kindly were
3112,FIFTH ADVENTURE,By him and eke by Gernot / and their men every one.
3113,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The noble thanes they greeted / as ever 'tis in honor done.
3114,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3115,FIFTH ADVENTURE,268
3116,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3117,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"With gold bright gleaming saddles / unto the land they brought,"
3118,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Good store of rich apparel / and shields all richly wrought
3119,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Unto the Rhine they carried / to that high festival.
3120,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And joyous days were coming / for the wounded warriors all.
3121,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3122,FIFTH ADVENTURE,269
3123,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3124,FIFTH ADVENTURE,They who yet on couches / lay wounded grievously
3125,FIFTH ADVENTURE,For joy had soon forgotten / how bitter death would be:
3126,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The sick and all the ailing / no need of pity had.
3127,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Anent the days of feasting / were they o'er the tidings glad,"
3128,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3129,FIFTH ADVENTURE,270
3130,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3131,FIFTH ADVENTURE,How they should make them merry / there where all were so.
3132,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Delight beyond all measure, / of joys an overflow,"
3133,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Had in sooth the people / seen on every hand:
3134,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then rose a mickle joyance / over all King Gunther's land.
3135,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3136,FIFTH ADVENTURE,271
3137,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3138,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Full many a warrior valiant / one morn at Whitsuntide
3139,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"All gorgeously apparelled / was thither seen to ride,"
3140,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Five thousand men or over, / where the feast should be;"
3141,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And vied in every quarter / knight with knight in revelry.
3142,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3143,FIFTH ADVENTURE,272
3144,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3145,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Thereof the host was mindful, / for he well did understand"
3146,FIFTH ADVENTURE,How at heart right warmly / the hero of Netherland
3147,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Loved alone his sister, / though her he ne'er had seen,"
3148,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Who praised for wondrous beauty / before all maidens else had been.
3149,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3150,FIFTH ADVENTURE,273
3151,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3152,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then spake the thane so noble / of Metz Sir Ortwein:
3153,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Wilt thou full be honored / by every guest of thine,"
3154,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then do them all the pleasure / the winsome maids to see,"

3156,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3157,FIFTH ADVENTURE,274

3159,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""What were a man's chief pleasure, / his very joy of life,"
3160,FIFTH ADVENTURE,An 't were not a lovely maiden / or a stately wife?
3161,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then let the maid thy sister / before thy guests appear."""
3162,FIFTH ADVENTURE,--Brave thanes did there full many / at heart rejoice the rede to hear.
3163,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3164,FIFTH ADVENTURE,275
3165,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3166,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Thy words I'll gladly follow,"" / then the monarch said,"
3167,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And all the knights who heard him / ere thereat right glad.
3168,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then told was Queen Ute / and eke her daughter fair,"
3169,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That they with maids in waiting / unto the court should soon repair.
3170,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3171,FIFTH ADVENTURE,276
3172,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3173,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then in well-stored wardrobes / rich attire they sought,"
3174,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And forth from folding covers / their glittering dresses brought,"
3175,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Armbands and silken girdles / of which they many had.
3176,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And zealous to adorn her / was then full many a winsome maid.
3177,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3178,FIFTH ADVENTURE,277
3179,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3180,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Full many a youthful squire / upon that day did try,"
3181,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"By decking of his person, / to win fair lady's eye;"
3182,FIFTH ADVENTURE,For the which great good fortune / he'd take no monarch's crown:
3183,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"They longed to see those maidens, / whom they before had never known."
3184,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3185,FIFTH ADVENTURE,278
3186,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3187,FIFTH ADVENTURE,For her especial service / the king did order then
3188,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"To wait upon his sister / a hundred of his men,"
3189,FIFTH ADVENTURE,As well upon his mother: / they carried sword in hand.
3190,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That was the court attendance / there in the Burgundian land.
3191,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3192,FIFTH ADVENTURE,279
3193,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3194,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Ute, queen so stately, / then came forth with her:"
3195,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And with the queen in waiting / ladies fair there were,"
3196,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"A hundred or over, / in festal robes arrayed."
3197,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Eke went there with Kriemhild / full many a fair and winsome maid.
3198,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3199,FIFTH ADVENTURE,280
3200,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3201,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Forth from their own apartments / they all were seen to go:
3202,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"There was a mickle pressing / of good knights to and fro,"
3203,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Who hoped to win the pleasure, / if such a thing might be,"
3204,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"The noble maiden Kriemhild, / delight of every eye, to see."
3205,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3206,FIFTH ADVENTURE,281
3207,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3208,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Now came she fair and lovely, / as the ruddy sun of morn"
3209,FIFTH ADVENTURE,From misty clouds emerging. / Straight he who long had borne
3210,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Her in his heart and loved her, / from all his gloom was freed,"
3211,FIFTH ADVENTURE,As so stately there before him / he saw the fair and lovely maid.
3212,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3213,FIFTH ADVENTURE,282
3214,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3215,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Her rich apparel glittered / with many a precious stone,"
3216,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And with a ruddy beauty / her cheeks like roses shone.
3217,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Though you should wish to do so, / you could not say, I ween,"
3218,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That e'er a fairer lady / in all the world before was seen.
3219,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3220,FIFTH ADVENTURE,283
3221,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3222,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"As in a sky all starlit / the moon shines out so bright,"
3223,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And through the cloudlets peering / pours down her gentle light,"
3224,FIFTH ADVENTURE,E'en so was Kriemhild's beauty / among her ladies fair:
3225,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The hearts of gallant heroes / were gladder when they saw her there.
3226,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3227,FIFTH ADVENTURE,284
3228,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3229,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"The richly clad attendants / moved stately on before,"
3230,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And the valiant thanes high-hearted / stood patiently no more,"
3231,FIFTH ADVENTURE,But pressed right eager forward / to see the lovely maid:
3232,FIFTH ADVENTURE,In noble Siegfried's bosom / alternate joy and anguish swayed.
3233,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3234,FIFTH ADVENTURE,285
3235,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3236,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"He thought with heart despairing, / ""How could it ever be,"
3237,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That I should win thy favor? / There hoped I foolishly.
3238,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"But had I e'er to shun thee, / then were I rather dead."""
3239,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And oft, to think upon it, / the color from his visage fled."
3240,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3241,FIFTH ADVENTURE,286
3242,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3243,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The noble son of Siegmund / did there so stately stand
3244,FIFTH ADVENTURE,As if his form were pictured / by good old master's hand
3245,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Upon a piece of parchment. / All who saw, confessed"
3246,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That he of all good heroes / was the stateliest and the best.
3247,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3248,FIFTH ADVENTURE,287
3249,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3250,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The fair Kriemhild's attendants / gave order to make way
3251,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"On all sides for the ladies, / and willing thanes obey."
3252,FIFTH ADVENTURE,To see their noble bearing / did every warrior cheer;
3253,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Full many a stately lady / of gentle manner born was there.
3254,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3255,FIFTH ADVENTURE,288
3256,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3257,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then outspake of Burgundy / Gernot the valiant knight:
3258,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""To him who thus has helped thee / so bravely in the fight,"
3259,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther, royal brother, / shalt thou like favor show,"
3260,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"A thane before all others; / he's worthy of it well, I trow."
3261,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3262,FIFTH ADVENTURE,289
3263,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3264,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Let then the doughty Siegfried / unto my sister go"
3265,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"To have the maiden's greetings, / --'twill be our profit so."
3266,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"She that ne'er greeted hero / shall greet him courteously,"
3267,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"That thus the stately warrior / for aye our faithful friend may be."""
3268,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3269,FIFTH ADVENTURE,290
3270,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3271,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The king's knights hastened gladly / upon his high command
3272,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And told these joyous tidings / to the prince of Netherland.
3273,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""It is the king's good pleasure / that thou to court shalt go,"
3274,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"To have his sister's greetings; / to honor thee 'tis ordered so."""
3275,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3276,FIFTH ADVENTURE,291
3277,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3278,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then was the thane full valiant / thereat soon filled with joy.
3279,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Yea, bore he in his bosom / delight without alloy"
3280,FIFTH ADVENTURE,At thought that he should straightway / Ute's fair daughter see.
3281,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried anon she greeted / in courteous manner lovingly.
3282,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3283,FIFTH ADVENTURE,292
3284,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3285,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"As she saw the knight high-hearted / there before her stand,"
3286,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Blushed red and spake the maiden, / the fairest of the land:"
3287,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""A welcome, brave Sir Siegfried, / thou noble knight and good."""
3288,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"As soon as he had heard it, / the hearty greeting cheered his mood."
3289,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3290,FIFTH ADVENTURE,293
3291,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3292,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Before her low he bended; / him by the hand took she,"
3293,FIFTH ADVENTURE,And by her onward wended / the knight full willingly.
3294,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"They cast upon each other / fond glances many a one,"
3295,FIFTH ADVENTURE,The knight and eke the maiden; / furtively it all was done.
3296,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3297,FIFTH ADVENTURE,294
3298,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3299,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Whether he pressed friendly / that hand as white as snow
3300,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"From the love he bore her, / that I do not know;"
3301,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Yet believe I cannot / that this was left undone,"
3302,FIFTH ADVENTURE,For straightway showed the maiden / that he her heart had fully won.
3303,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3304,FIFTH ADVENTURE,295
3305,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3306,FIFTH ADVENTURE,In the sunny summer season / and in the month of May
3307,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Had his heart seen never / before so glad a day,"
3308,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Nor one so fully joyous, / as when he walked beside"
3309,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That maiden rich in beauty / whom fain he'd choose to be his bride.
3310,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3311,FIFTH ADVENTURE,296
3312,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3313,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then thought many a warrior: / ""Were it likewise granted me"
3314,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"To walk beside the maiden, / just as now I see,"
3315,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Or to lie beside her, / how gladly were that done!"""
3316,FIFTH ADVENTURE,But ne'er a knight more fully / had gracious lady's favor won.
3317,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3318,FIFTH ADVENTURE,297
3319,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3320,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"From all the lands far distant / were guests distinguished there,"
3321,FIFTH ADVENTURE,But fixed each eye was only / upon this single pair.
3322,FIFTH ADVENTURE,By royal leave did Kriemhild / kiss then the stately knight:
3323,FIFTH ADVENTURE,In all the world he never / before had known so rare delight.
3324,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3325,FIFTH ADVENTURE,298
3326,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3327,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then full of strange forebodings, / of Denmark spake the king:"
3328,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""This full loving greeting / to many woe will bring,"
3329,FIFTH ADVENTURE,--My heart in secret warns me-- / through Siegfried's doughty hand.
3330,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"God give that he may never / again be seen within my land."""
3331,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3332,FIFTH ADVENTURE,299
3333,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3334,FIFTH ADVENTURE,On all sides then 'twas ordered / 'fore Kriemhild and her train
3335,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Of women make free passage. / Full many a valiant thane
3336,FIFTH ADVENTURE,With her unto the minster / in courtly way went on.
3337,FIFTH ADVENTURE,But from her side was parted / the full stately knight anon.
3338,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3339,FIFTH ADVENTURE,300
3340,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3341,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then went she to the minster, / and with her many a maid."
3342,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"In such rich apparel / Kriemhild was arrayed,"
3343,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That hearty wishes many / there were made in vain:
3344,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Her comely form delighted / the eye of many a noble thane.
3345,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3346,FIFTH ADVENTURE,301
3347,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3348,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Scarce could tarry Siegfried / till mass was sung the while.
3349,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And surely did Dame Fortune / upon him kindly smile,"
3350,FIFTH ADVENTURE,To him she was so gracious / whom in his heart he bore.
3351,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Eke did he the maiden, / as she full well deserved, adore."
3352,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3353,FIFTH ADVENTURE,302
3354,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3355,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"As after mass then Kriemhild / came to the minster door,"
3356,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"The knight his homage offered, / as he had done before."
3357,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then began to thank him / the full beauteous maid,"
3358,FIFTH ADVENTURE,That he her royal brothers / did 'gainst their foes so nobly aid.
3359,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3360,FIFTH ADVENTURE,303
3361,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3362,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""God speed thee, Sir Siegfried,"" / spake the maiden fair,"
3363,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""For thou hast well deserved / that all these warriors are,"
3364,FIFTH ADVENTURE,"As it hath now been told me, / right grateful unto thee."""
3365,FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then gan he cast his glances / on the Lady Kriemhild lovingly.
3366,FIFTH ADVENTURE,
3367,FIFTH ADVENTURE,304

3754,SIXTH ADVENTURE,358
3755,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3756,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Spake thereupon the maiden: / ""Now mark ye what I say:"
3757,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Myself have silks in plenty; / now send us rich supply
3758,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Of stones borne on bucklers, / so vesture we'll prepare."""
3759,SIXTH ADVENTURE,To do it royal Gunther / and Siegfried both right ready were.
3760,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3761,SIXTH ADVENTURE,359
3762,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3763,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""And who are your companions,"" / further questioned she,"
3764,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""Who with you apparelled / now for court shall be?"""
3765,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""I it is and Siegfried, / and of my men are two,"
3766,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Dankwart and Hagen, / who with us to court shall go."

3768,SIXTH ADVENTURE,360
3769,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3770,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""Now rightly what we tell thee, / mark, O sister dear:"

3774,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3775,SIXTH ADVENTURE,361
3776,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3777,SIXTH ADVENTURE,After fair leave-taking / the knights departed so.
3778,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Then of her attendants / thirty maids to go
3779,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Forth from her apartments / Kriemhild the princess bade,"
3780,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Of those that greatest cunning / in such skilful working had.
3781,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3782,SIXTH ADVENTURE,362
3783,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3784,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"The silks that were of Araby / white as the snow in sheen,"
3785,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"And from the land of Zazamank / like unto grass so green,"
3786,SIXTH ADVENTURE,With stones of price they broidered; / that made apparel rare.
3787,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Herself she cut them, Kriemhild / the royal maiden debonair."
3788,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3789,SIXTH ADVENTURE,363
3790,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3791,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Fur linings fashioned fairly / from dwellers in the sea
3792,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Beheld by people rarely, / the best that e'er might be,"
3793,SIXTH ADVENTURE,With silken stuffs they covered / for the knights to wear.
3794,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Now shall ye of the shining / weeds full many a wonder hear.
3795,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3796,SIXTH ADVENTURE,364
3797,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3798,SIXTH ADVENTURE,From land of far Morocco / and eke from Libya
3799,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Of silks the very finest / that ever mortal saw
3800,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"With any monarch's kindred, / they had a goodly store."
3801,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Well showed the Lady Kriemhild / that unto them good will she bore.
3802,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3803,SIXTH ADVENTURE,365
3804,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3805,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Since they unto the journey / had wished that so it be,"
3806,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Skins of costly ermine / used they lavishly,"
3807,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Whereon were silken pieces / black as coal inlaid.
3808,SIXTH ADVENTURE,To-day were any nobles / in robes so fashioned well arrayed.
3809,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3810,SIXTH ADVENTURE,366
3811,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3812,SIXTH ADVENTURE,From the gold of Araby / many a stone there shone.
3813,SIXTH ADVENTURE,The women long were busy / before the work was done;
3814,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"But all the robes were finished / ere seven weeks did pass,"
3815,SIXTH ADVENTURE,When also trusty armor / for the warriors ready was.
3816,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3817,SIXTH ADVENTURE,367
3818,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3819,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"When they at length were ready / adown the Rhine to fare,"
3820,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"A ship lay waiting for them / strong built with mickle care,"
3821,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Which should bear them safely / far down unto the sea.
3822,SIXTH ADVENTURE,The maidens rich in beauty / plied their work laboriously.
3823,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3824,SIXTH ADVENTURE,368
3825,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3826,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Then 'twas told the warriors / for them was ready there
3827,SIXTH ADVENTURE,The finely wrought apparel / that they were to wear;
3828,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Just as they had wished it, / so it had been made;"
3829,SIXTH ADVENTURE,After that the heroes / there by the Rhine no longer stayed.
3830,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3831,SIXTH ADVENTURE,369
3832,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3833,SIXTH ADVENTURE,To the knights departing / went soon a messenger:
3834,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Would they come in person / to view their new attire,"
3835,SIXTH ADVENTURE,If it had been fitted / short and long aright.
3836,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"'Twas found of proper measure, / and thanked those ladies fair each"
3837,SIXTH ADVENTURE,knight.
3838,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3839,SIXTH ADVENTURE,370
3840,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3841,SIXTH ADVENTURE,And all who there beheld them / they must needs confess
3842,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That in the world they never / had gazed on fairer dress:
3843,SIXTH ADVENTURE,At court to wear th' apparel / did therefore please them well.
3844,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Of warriors better furnished / never could a mortal tell.
3845,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3846,SIXTH ADVENTURE,371
3847,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3848,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Thanks oft-times repeated / were there not forgot.
3849,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Leave of parting from them / the noble knights then sought:
3850,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Like thanes of noble bearing / they went in courteous wise.
3851,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Then dim and wet with weeping / grew thereat two shining eyes.
3852,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3853,SIXTH ADVENTURE,372
3854,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3855,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"She spake: ""O dearest brother, / still here thou mightest stay,"
3856,SIXTH ADVENTURE,And woo another woman-- / that were the better way--
3857,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Where so sore endangered / stood not thus thy life.
3858,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Here nearer canst thou find thee / equally a high-born wife."""
3859,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3860,SIXTH ADVENTURE,373
3861,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3862,SIXTH ADVENTURE,I ween their hearts did tell them / what later came to pass.
3863,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"They wept there all together, / whatever spoken was."
3864,SIXTH ADVENTURE,The gold upon their bosoms / was sullied 'neath the tears
3865,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That from their eyes in plenty / fell adown amid their fears.
3866,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3867,SIXTH ADVENTURE,374
3868,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3869,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"She spake: ""O noble Siegfried, / to thee commended be"
3870,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Upon thy truth and goodness / the brother dear to me,"
3871,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"That he come unscathed / home from Brunhild's land."""
3872,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That plighted the full valiant / knight in Lady Kriemhild's hand.
3873,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3874,SIXTH ADVENTURE,375
3875,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3876,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"The mighty thane gave answer: / ""If I my life retain,"
3877,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Then shall thy cares, good Lady, / all have been in vain."
3878,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"All safe I'll bring him hither / again unto the Rhine,"
3879,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Be that to thee full sicker."" / To him did the fair maid incline."
3880,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3881,SIXTH ADVENTURE,376
3882,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3883,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Their shields of golden color / were borne unto the strand,"
3884,SIXTH ADVENTURE,And all their trusty armor / was ready brought to hand.
3885,SIXTH ADVENTURE,They bade their horses bring them: / they would at last depart.
3886,SIXTH ADVENTURE,--Thereat did fairest women / weep with sad foreboding heart.
3887,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3888,SIXTH ADVENTURE,377
3889,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3890,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Down from lofty casement / looked many a winsome maid,"
3891,SIXTH ADVENTURE,As ship and sail together / by stirring breeze were swayed.
3892,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Upon the Rhine they found them, / the warriors full of pride."
3893,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Then outspake King Gunther: / ""Who now is here the ship to guide?"""
3894,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3895,SIXTH ADVENTURE,378
3896,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3897,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""That will I,"" spake Siegfried; / ""I can upon the flood"
3898,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Lead you on in safety, / that know ye, heroes good;"
3899,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"For all the water highways / are known right well to me."""
3900,SIXTH ADVENTURE,With joy they then departed / from the land of Burgundy.
3901,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3902,SIXTH ADVENTURE,379
3903,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3904,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"A mighty pole then grasped he, / Siegfried the doughty man,"
3905,SIXTH ADVENTURE,And the ship from shore / forth to shove began.
3906,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Gunther the fearless also / himself took oar in hand.
3907,SIXTH ADVENTURE,The knights thus brave and worthy / took departure from the land.
3908,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3909,SIXTH ADVENTURE,380
3910,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3911,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"They carried rich provisions, / thereto the best of wine"
3912,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That might in any quarter / be found about the Rhine.
3913,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Their chargers stood in comfort / and rested by the way:
3914,SIXTH ADVENTURE,The ship it moved so lightly / that naught of injury had they.
3915,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3916,SIXTH ADVENTURE,381
3917,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3918,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Stretched before the breezes / were the great sail-ropes tight,"
3919,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"And twenty miles they journeyed / ere did come the night,"
3920,SIXTH ADVENTURE,By fair breezes favored / down toward the sea.
3921,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Their toil repaid thereafter / the dauntless knights full grievously.
3922,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3923,SIXTH ADVENTURE,382
3924,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3925,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Upon the twelfth morning, / as we in story hear,"
3926,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Had they by the breezes / thence been carried far,"
3927,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Unto Castle Isenstein / and Brunhild's country:
3928,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That to Siegfried only / was known of all the company.
3929,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3930,SIXTH ADVENTURE,383
3931,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3932,SIXTH ADVENTURE,As soon as saw King Gunther / so many towers rise
3933,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"And eke the boundless marches / stretch before his eyes,"
3934,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"He spake: ""Tell me, friend Siegfried, / is it known to thee"
3935,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Whose they are, the castles / and the majestic broad country?"""
3936,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3937,SIXTH ADVENTURE,384
3938,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3939,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Thereto gave answer Siegfried: / ""That well to me is known:"
3940,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Brunhild for their mistress / do land and people own
3941,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"And Isenstein's firm towers, / as ye have heard me say."
3942,SIXTH ADVENTURE,Ladies fair a many / shall ye here behold to-day.
3943,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3944,SIXTH ADVENTURE,385
3945,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3946,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""And I will give you counsel: / be it well understood"
3947,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That all your words must tally / --so methinks 'twere good.
3948,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"If ere to-day is over / our presence she command,"
3949,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Must we leave pride behind us, / as before Brunhild we stand."
3950,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3951,SIXTH ADVENTURE,386
3952,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3953,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""When we the lovely lady / 'mid her retainers see,"
3954,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Then shall ye, good companions, / in all your speech agree"
3955,SIXTH ADVENTURE,That Gunther is my master / and I his serving-man:
3956,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"'Tis thus that all he hopeth / shall we in the end attain."""
3957,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3958,SIXTH ADVENTURE,387
3959,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3960,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"To do as he had bidden / consented straight each one,"
3961,SIXTH ADVENTURE,And spite of proudest spirit / they left it not undone.
3962,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"All that he wished they promised, / and good it proved to be"
3963,SIXTH ADVENTURE,When anon King Gunther / the fair Brunhild came to see.
3964,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3965,SIXTH ADVENTURE,388
3966,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3967,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"""Not all to meet thy wishes / do I such service swear,"
3968,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"But most 'tis for thy sister, / Kriemhild the maiden fair;"
3969,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Just as my soul unto me / she is my very life,"
3970,SIXTH ADVENTURE,"And fain would I deserve it / that she in truth become my wife."""

3974,SIXTH ADVENTURE,
3975,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,SEVENTH ADVENTURE
3976,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3977,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,How Gunther won Brunhild
3978,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3979,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,389
3980,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3981,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The while they thus did parley / their ship did forward glide
3982,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,So near unto the castle / that soon the king espied
3983,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Aloft within the casements / many a maiden fair to see.
3984,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That all to him were strangers / thought King Gunther mournfully.
3985,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3986,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,390
3987,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3988,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"He asked then of Siegfried, / who bare him company:"
3989,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Know'st thou aught of the maidens, / who the same may be,"
3990,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Gazing yonder downward / upon us on the tide?
3991,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Howe'er is named their master, / minded are they high in pride."""
3992,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3993,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,391
3994,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
3995,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the valiant Siegfried: / ""Now thither shalt thou spy"
3996,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Unseen among the ladies, / then not to me deny"
3997,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Which, wert thou free in choosing, / thou'dst take to be thy queen."""
3998,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""That will I do,"" then answered / Gunther the valiant knight and keen."
3999,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4000,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,392
4001,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4002,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""I see there one among them / by yonder casement stand,"
4003,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Clad in snow-white raiment: / 'tis she my eyes demand,"
4004,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"So buxom she in stature, / so fair she is to see."
4005,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"An I were free in choosing, / she it is my wife must be."""
4006,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4007,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,393
4008,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4009,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Full well now in choosing / thine eyes have guided thee:"
4010,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"It is the stately Brunhild / the maiden fair to see,"
4011,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"That doth now unto her / thy heart and soul compel."""
4012,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,All the maiden's bearing / pleased the royal Gunther well.
4013,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4014,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,394
4015,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4016,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,But soon the queen commanded / from casement all to go
4017,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Of those her beauteous maidens: / they should not stand there so
4018,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,To be gazed at by the strangers. / They must obey her word.
4019,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"What were the ladies doing, / of that moreover have we heard."
4020,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4021,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,395
4022,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4023,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto the noble strangers / their beauty they would show,"
4024,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,A thing which lovely women / are ever wont to do.
4025,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto the narrow casements / came they crowding on,"
4026,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"When they spied the strangers: / that they might also see, 'twas done."
4027,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4028,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,396
4029,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4030,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"But four the strangers numbered, / who came unto that land."
4031,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried the doughty / the king's steed led in hand:
4032,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"They saw it from the casements, / many a lovely maid,"
4033,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And saw the willing service / unto royal Gunther paid.
4034,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4035,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,397
4036,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4037,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then held he by the bridle / for him his gallant steed,"
4038,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"A good and fair-formed charger, / strong and of noble breed,"
4039,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Until the royal Gunther / into the saddle sprung.
4040,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Thus did serve him Siegfried: / a service all forgot ere long.
4041,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4042,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,398
4043,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4044,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then his own steed he also / led forth upon the shore.
4045,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Such menial service had he / full seldom done before,"
4046,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That he should hold the stirrup / for monarch whomsoe'er.
4047,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Down gazing from the casements / beheld it ladies high and fair.
4048,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4049,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,399
4050,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4051,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"At every point according, / the heroes well bedight"
4052,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,--Their dress and eke their chargers / of color snowy white--
4053,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Were like unto each other, / and well-wrought shield each one"
4054,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Of the good knights bore with him, / that brightly glimmered in the sun."
4055,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4056,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,400
4057,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4058,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Jewelled well was saddle / and narrow martingale
4059,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"As they rode so stately / in front of Brunhild's Hall,"
4060,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And thereon bells were hanging / of red gold shining bright.
4061,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"So came they to that country, / as fitting was for men of might,"
4062,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4063,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,401
4064,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4065,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"With spears all newly polished, / with swords, well-made that were"
4066,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And by the stately heroes / hung down unto the spur:
4067,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Such bore the valiant riders / of broad and cutting blade.
4068,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The noble show did witness / Brunhild the full stately maid.
4069,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4070,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,402
4071,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4072,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"With him came then Dankwart / and Hagen, doughty thane."
4073,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The story further telleth / how that the heroes twain
4074,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Of color black as raven / rich attire wore,"
4075,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And each a broad and mighty / shield of rich adornment bore.
4076,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4077,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,403
4078,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4079,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Rich stones from India's country / every eye could see,"
4080,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Impending on their tunics, / sparkle full brilliantly."
4081,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Their vessel by the river / they left without a guard,"
4082,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,As thus the valiant heroes / rode undaunted castleward.
4083,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4084,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,404
4085,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4086,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Six and fourscore towers / without they saw rise tall,"
4087,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Three spacious palaces / and moulded well a hall
4088,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"All wrought of precious marble / green as blade of grass,"
4089,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Wherein the royal Brunhild / with company of fair ladies was.
4090,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4091,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,405
4092,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4093,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The castle doors unbolted / were flung open wide
4094,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,As out toward them / the men of Brunhild hied
4095,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And received the strangers / into their Lady's land.
4096,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Their steeds they bade take over, / and also shield from out the hand."
4097,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4098,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,406
4099,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4100,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake a man-in-waiting: / ""Give o'er the sword each thane,"
4101,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And eke the shining armor.""-- / ""Good friend, thou ask'st in vain,"""
4102,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake of Tronje Hagen; / ""the same we'd rather wear."""
4103,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then gan straightway Siegfried / the country's custom to declare.
4104,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4105,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,407
4106,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4107,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""'Tis wont within this castle, / --of that be now aware--"
4108,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That never any stranger / weapons here shall bear.
4109,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Now let them hence be carried: / well dost thou as I say."""
4110,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"In this did full unwilling / Hagen, Gunther's man, obey."
4111,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4112,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,408
4113,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4114,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,They bade the strangers welcome / with drink and fitting rest.
4115,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Soon might you see on all sides / full many knights the best
4116,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,In princely weeds apparelled / to their reception go:
4117,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Yet did they mickle gazing / who would the keen new-comers know.
4118,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4119,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,409
4120,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4121,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then unto Lady Brunhild / the tidings strange were brought
4122,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"How that unknown warriors / now her land had sought,"
4123,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,In stately apparel / come sailing o'er the sea.
4124,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The maiden fair and stately / gave question how the same might be.
4125,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4126,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,410
4127,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4128,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now shall ye straight inform me,"" / spake she presently,"
4129,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Who so unfamiliar / these warrior knights may be,"
4130,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"That within my castle / thus so lordly stand,"
4131,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And for whose sake the heroes / have hither journeyed to my land."""
4132,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,

4302,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4303,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,435
4304,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4305,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then followed her attendants / and with them thither brought
4306,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"At once a shield full stately, / of pure red gold 'twas wrought,"

4311,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4312,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"To hold the shield securely / a well-wrought band there was,"
4313,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Whereon lay precious jewels / green as blade of grass.
4314,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Full many a ray their lustre / shot round against the gold.
4315,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,He were a man full valiant / whom this high dame should worthy hold.
4316,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4317,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,437
4318,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4319,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The shield was 'neath the boss-point, / as to us is said,"
4320,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Good three spans in thickness, / which should bear the maid."
4321,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Of steel 'twas wrought so richly / and had of gold such share,"

4330,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4331,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,439
4332,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4333,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,List more of her apparel; / she had a goodly store.
4334,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Of silk of Azagang / a tunic made she wore,"

4336,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Forth from the queen it covered, / full many a sparkling precious stone."
4337,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4338,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,440
4339,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4340,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then brought they for the lady, / large and heavy there,"
4341,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"As she was wont to hurl it, / a sharply-pointed spear;"
4342,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Strong and massive was it, / huge and broad as well,"
4343,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And at both its edges / it cut with devastation fell.
4344,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4345,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,441
4346,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4347,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,To know the spear was heavy / list ye wonders more:
4348,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Three spears of common measure / 'twould make, and something o'er."
4349,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Of Brunhild's attendants / three scarce the same could bear.
4350,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The heart of noble Gunther / thereat began to fill with fear.
4351,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4352,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,442
4353,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4354,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Within his soul he thought him: / ""What pickle am I in?"

4358,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4359,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,443
4360,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4361,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then spake Hagen's brother / the valiant Dankwart:
4362,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""In truth this royal journey / doth sorely grieve my heart."
4363,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"We passed for good knights one time: / what caitiff's death, if we"
4364,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Here in far-off country / a woman's game are doomed to be!

4367,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4368,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""It rueth me full sorely / that I came to this land."

4370,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And had I mine to help him, / a bit more gently then,"
4371,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"A little tame of spirit, / might show themselves all Brunhild's men."
4372,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4373,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,445

4378,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Amid the souls departed / this fair maid herself should be."""

4381,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4382,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Well should we unhampered / quit at last this land,"""
4383,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake his brother Hagen, / ""did we in armor stand,"

4386,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4387,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,447
4388,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4389,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Well heard the noble maiden / what the warriors spoke.
4390,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Back athwart her shoulder / she sent a smiling look:
4391,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now thinks he him so valiant, / so let them armed stand;"
4392,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Their full keen-edged broadswords / give the warriors each in hand."""
4393,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4394,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,448
4395,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4396,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"When they their swords received, / as the maiden said,"
4397,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The full valiant Dankwart / with joy his face grew red.
4398,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now play they what them pleaseth,"" / cried the warrior brave;"

4400,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4401,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,449
4402,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4403,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The royal Brunhild's prowess / with terror was it shown.
4404,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Into the ring they bore her / in sooth a ponderous stone,"
4405,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Great and all unwieldy, / huge it was and round:"
4406,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And scarce good knights a dozen / together raised it from the ground.
4407,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4408,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,450
4409,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4410,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,To put this was her custom / after trial with the spear.
4411,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Thereat the men of Burgundy / began to quake with fear.
4412,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Alack! Alack!"" quoth Hagen, / ""what seeks the king for bride?"

4414,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4415,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,451
4416,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4417,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"On her white arms the flowing / sleeves she backward flung,"
4418,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then with grasp of power / the shield in hand she swung,"
4419,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And spear poised high above her. / So did the contest start.
4420,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Gunther and Siegfried / saw Brunhild's ire with falling heart.
4421,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4422,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,452
4423,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4424,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And were it not that Siegfried / a ready help did bring,"
4425,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Surely then had perished / beneath her hand the king.
4426,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,There went he unperceived / and the king's hand did touch.
4427,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Gunther at his cunning / artifice was troubled much.
4428,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4429,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,453
4430,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4431,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""What is that hath touched me?"" / thought the monarch keen."
4432,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then gazed he all around him: / none was there to be seen.
4433,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"A voice spake: ""Siegfried is it, / a friend that holds thee dear."
4434,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Before this royal maiden / shall thy heart be free from fear.

4438,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Thy shield in hand now give me / and leave it me to bear,"

4441,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"When he did know him rightly, / the monarch's heart was filled with glee."

4445,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now secret keep my cunning, / let none e'er know the same:"

4448,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Behold now how the lady / stands before thee void of fear."""
4449,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4450,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,456
4451,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4452,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The spear the stately maiden / with might and main did wield,"
4453,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And huge and broad she hurled it / upon the new-made shield,"
4454,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That on his arm did carry / the son of Siegelind;
4455,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,From the steel the sparks flew hissing / as if were blowing fierce the
4456,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,wind.
4457,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4458,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,457
4459,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4460,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The mighty spear sharp-pointed / full through the shield did crash,"
4461,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That ye from off the mail-rings / might see the lightning flash.
4462,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Beneath its force they stumbled, / did both those men of might;"
4463,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,But for the sightless mantle / they both were killed there outright.
4464,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4465,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,458
4466,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4467,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,From mouth of the full doughty / Siegfried burst the blood.
4468,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Full soon he yet recovered; / then seized the warrior good
4469,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The spear that from her strong arm / thus his shield had rent,"
4470,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And back with force as came it / the hand of doughty Siegfried sent.
4471,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4472,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,459
4473,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4474,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"He thought: ""To pierce the maiden / were but small glory earned,"""
4475,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And so the spear's sharp edges / backward pointing turned;
4476,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Against her mail-clad body / he made the shaft to bound,"
4477,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And with such might he sent it / full loud her armor did resound.
4478,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4479,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,460
4480,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4481,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The sparks as if in stormwind / from mail-rings flew around.
4482,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,So mightily did hurl it / the son of Siegmund
4483,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That she with all her power / could not the shaft withstand.
4484,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,In sooth it ne'er was speeded / so swiftly by King Gunther's hand.
4485,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4486,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,461
4487,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4488,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,But to her feet full sudden / had sprung Brunhild fair.
4489,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""A shot, O noble Gunther, / befitting hero rare."""
4490,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"She weened himself had done it, / and all unaided he,"

4492,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4493,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,462
4494,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4495,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then did she go full sudden, / wrathful was her mood,"
4496,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"A stone full high she heaved / the noble maiden good,"
4497,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And the same far from her / with might and main she swung:
4498,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Her armor's mail-rings jingled / as she herself thereafter sprung.
4499,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4500,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,463
4501,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4502,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The stone, when it had fallen, / lay fathoms twelve from there,"
4503,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And yet did spring beyond it / herself the maiden fair.
4504,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then where the stone was lying / thither Siegfried went:
4505,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther feigned to move it, / but by another arm 'twas sent."
4506,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4507,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,464
4508,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4509,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,A valiant man was Siegfried / full powerful and tall.
4510,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The stone then cast he farther, / and farther sprang withal."
4511,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,From those his arts so cunning / had he of strength such store
4512,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,That as he leaped he likewise / the weight of royal Gunther bore.
4513,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4514,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,465
4515,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4516,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And when the leap was ended / and fallen was the stone,"
4517,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then saw they ne'er another / but Gunther alone.
4518,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Brunhild the fair maiden, / red grew she in wrath:"
4519,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried yet had warded / from royal Gunther surest death.
4520,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4521,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,466
4522,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4523,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto her attendants / she spake in loud command,"
4524,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,When she saw 'cross the circle / the king unvanquished stand.
4525,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Come hither quick, my kinsmen, / and ye that wait on me;"
4526,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Henceforth unto Gunther / shall all be pledged faithfully."""
4527,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4528,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,467
4529,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4530,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then laid the knights full valiant / their swords from out the hand;
4531,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,At feet 'fore mighty Gunther / from Burgundian land
4532,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Offered himself in service / full many a valiant knight.
4533,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,They weened that he had conquered / in trial by his proper might.
4534,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4535,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,468
4536,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4537,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"He gave her loving greeting, / right courteous was he."
4538,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then by the hand she took him, / the maiden praiseworthy,"
4539,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,In pledge that all around him / was his to have and hold.
4540,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Whereat rejoiced Hagen / the warrior valorous and bold.
4541,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4542,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,469
4543,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4544,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Into the spacious palace / with her thence to go
4545,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Bade she the noble monarch. / When they had done so,"
4546,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then still greater honors / unto the knight were shown.
4547,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Dankwart and Hagen, / right willingly they saw it done."
4548,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4549,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,470
4550,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4551,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Siegfried the valiant, / by no means was he slow,"
4552,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,His sightless mantle did he / away in safety stow.
4553,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then went he again thither / where many a lady sat.
4554,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,He spake unto the monarch-- / full cunningly was done all that:
4555,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4556,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,471
4557,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4558,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Why bidest thus, my master? / Wilt not the play begin,"
4559,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,To which so oft hath challenged / thee the noble queen?
4560,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Let us soon have example / what may the trial be."""
4561,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"As knew he naught about it, / did the knight thus cunningly."
4562,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4563,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,472
4564,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4565,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the queen unto him: / ""How hath this ever been,"
4566,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"That of the play, Sir Siegfried, / nothing thou hast seen,"
4567,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Wherein hath been the victor / Gunther with mighty hand?"""
4568,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Thereto gave answer Hagen / a grim knight of Burgundian land.
4569,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4570,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,473
4571,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4572,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake he: ""There dost thou, Lady, / think ill without a cause:"
4573,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"By the ship down yonder / the noble Siegfried was,"
4574,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,The while the lord of Rhineland / in play did vanquish thee:
4575,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Thus knows he nothing of it,"" / spake Gunther's warrior courteously."
4576,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4577,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,474
4578,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4579,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""A joy to me these tidings,"" / the doughty Siegfried spoke,"
4580,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""That so thy haughty spirit / is brought beneath the yoke,"
4581,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And that yet one there liveth / master to be of thine.
4582,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Now shalt thou, noble maiden, / us follow thither to the Rhine."""
4583,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4584,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,475
4585,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4586,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the maiden shapely: / ""It may not yet be so."
4587,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,All my men and kindred / first the same must know.
4588,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,In sooth not all so lightly / can I quit my home.
4589,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"First must I bid my trusty / warriors that they hither come."""
4590,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4591,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,476
4592,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4593,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then bade she messengers / quickly forth to ride,"
4594,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And summoned in her kindred / and men from every side.
4595,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Without delay she prayed them / to come to Isenstein,"
4596,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,And bade them all be given / fit apparel rare and fine.
4597,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4598,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,477
4599,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4600,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then might ye see daily / 'twixt morn and eventide
4601,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Unto Brunhild's castle / many a knight to ride.
4602,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""God wot, God wot,"" quoth Hagen, / ""we do an evil thing,"
4603,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,To tarry here while Brunhild / doth thus her men together bring.
4604,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4605,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,478
4606,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4607,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""If now into this country / their good men they've brought"

4609,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Belike her wrath ariseth, / and we are men forlorn--"
4610,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then to be our ruin / were the noble maiden born."""
4611,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4612,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,479
4613,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4614,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the doughty Siegfried: / ""That matter leave to me."
4615,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Whereof thou now art fearful, / I'll never let it be."
4616,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Ready help I'll bring thee / hither unto this land,"
4617,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Knights of whom thou wotst not / till now I'll bring, a chosen band."
4618,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4619,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,480
4620,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4621,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Of me shalt thou ask not: / from hence will I fare."
4622,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,May God of thy good honor / meanwhile have a care.
4623,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"I come again right quickly / with a thousand men for thee,"
4624,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The very best of warriors / hitherto are known to me."""
4625,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4626,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,481
4627,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
4628,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Then tarry not unduly,"" / thus the monarch said."
4629,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Glad we are full fairly / of this thy timely aid."""
4630,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"He spake: ""Till I come to thee / full short shall be my stay."
4631,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"That thou thyself hast sent me / shalt thou unto Brunhild say."""
4632,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,

4638,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"How Siegfried fared to his Knights, the Nibelungen"
4639,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4640,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,482
4641,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4642,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Thence went then Siegfried / out through the castle door
4643,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,In his sightless mantle / to a boat upon the shore.
4644,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,As Siegmund's son doth board it / him no mortal sees;
4645,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And quickly off he steers it / as were it wafted by the breeze.
4646,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4647,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,483
4648,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4649,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"No one saw the boatman, / yet rapid was the flight"
4650,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Of the boat forth speeding / driven by Siegfried's might.
4651,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,They weened that did speed it / a swiftly blowing wind:
4652,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"No, 'twas Siegfried sped it, / the son of fairest Siegelind."
4653,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4654,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,484
4655,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4656,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,In that one day-time / and the following night
4657,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Came he to a country / by dint of mickle might,"
4658,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Long miles a hundred distant, / and something more than this:"
4659,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The Nibelungen were its people / where the mighty hoard was his.
4660,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4661,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,485
4662,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4663,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Alone did fare the hero / unto an island vast
4664,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Whereon the boat full quickly / the gallant knight made fast.
4665,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Of a castle then bethought him / high upon a hill,"
4666,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"And there a lodging sought him, / as wayworn men are wont to still."
4667,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4668,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,486
4669,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4670,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Then came he to the portals / that locked before him stood.
4671,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,They guarded well their honor / as people ever should.
4672,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"At the door he gan a-knocking, / for all unknown was he."
4673,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"But full well 'twas guarded, / and within it he did see"
4674,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4675,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,487
4676,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4677,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"A giant who the castle / did guard with watchful eye,"
4678,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And near him did at all times / his good weapons lie.
4679,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Quoth he: ""Who now that knocketh / at the door in such strange wise?"""
4680,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Without the valiant Siegfried / did cunningly his voice disguise.
4681,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4682,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,488
4683,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4684,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"He spake: ""A bold knight-errant / am I; unlock the gate."
4685,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Else will I from without here / disturbance rare create
4686,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"For all who'd fain lie quiet / and their rest would take."""
4687,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Wrathful grew the Porter / as in this wise Siegfried spake.
4688,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4689,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,489
4690,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4691,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Now did the giant valorous / his good armor don,"
4692,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And placed on head his helmet; / then the full doughty man
4693,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,His shield up-snatched quickly / and gate wide open swung.
4694,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,How sore was he enraged / as himself upon Siegfried he flung!
4695,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4696,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,490
4697,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4698,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,'How dared he thus awaken / brave knights within the hall?'
4699,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The blows in rapid showers / from his hand did fall.
4700,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Thereat the noble stranger / began himself to shield.
4701,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"For so a club of iron / the Porter's mighty arm did wield,"
4702,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4703,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,491
4704,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4705,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"That splinters flew from buckler, / and Siegfried stood aghast"
4706,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"From fear that this same hour / was doomed to be his last,"
4707,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,So mightily the Porter's / blows about him fell.
4708,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,To find such faithful warder / did please his master Siegfried well.
4709,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4710,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,492
4711,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4712,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,So fiercely did they struggle / that castle far within
4713,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And hall where slept the Nibelungen / echoed back the din.
4714,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,But Siegfried pressed the Porter / and soon he had him bound.
4715,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,In all the land of Nibelungen / the story soon was bruited round.
4716,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4717,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,493
4718,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4719,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"When the grim sound of fighting / afar the place had filled,"
4720,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Alberich did hear it, / a Dwarf full brave and wild."
4721,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"He donned his armor deftly, / and running thither found"
4722,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,This so noble stranger / where he the doughty Porter bound.
4723,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4724,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,494
4725,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4726,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Alberich was full wrathy, / thereto a man of power."
4727,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Coat of mail and helmet / he on his body wore,"
4728,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And in his hand a heavy / scourge of gold he swung.
4729,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Where was fighting Siegfried, / thither in mickle haste he sprung."
4730,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4731,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,495
4732,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4733,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Seven knobs thick and heavy / on the club's end were seen,"
4734,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Wherewith the shield that guarded / the knight that was so keen
4735,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,He battered with such vigor / that pieces from it brake.
4736,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Lest he his life should forfeit / the noble stranger gan to quake.
4737,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4738,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,496
4739,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4740,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The shield that all was battered / from his hand he flung;
4741,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"And into sheath, too, thrust he / his sword so good and long."
4742,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"For his trusty chamberlain / he did not wish to slay,"
4743,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And in such case he could not / grant his anger fullest sway.
4744,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4745,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,497
4746,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4747,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,With but his hands so mighty / at Alberich he ran.
4748,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"By the beard then seized he / the gray and aged man,"
4749,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And in such manner pulled it / that he full loud did roar.
4750,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The youthful hero's conduct / Alberich did trouble sore.
4751,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4752,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,498
4753,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4754,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Loud cried the valiant steward: / ""Have mercy now on me."
4755,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"And might I other's vassal / than one good hero's be,"
4756,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"To whom to be good subject / I an oath did take,"
4757,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Until my death I'd serve thee."" / Thus the man of cunning spake."
4758,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4759,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,499
4760,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4761,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Alberich then bound he / as the giant before.
4762,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The mighty arm of Siegfried / did trouble him full sore.
4763,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"The Dwarf began to question: / ""Thy name, what may it be?"""
4764,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Quoth he: ""My name is Siegfried; / I weened I well were known to thee."""
4765,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4766,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,500
4767,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4768,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"""I joy to hear such tidings,"" / Dwarf Alberich replied."
4769,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"""Well now have I found thee / in knightly prowess tried,"
4770,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And with goodly reason / lord o'er lands to be.
4771,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"I'll do whate'er thou biddest, / wilt thou only give me free."""
4772,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4773,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,501
4774,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4775,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake his master Siegfried: / ""Quickly shalt thou go,"
4776,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"And bring me knights hither, / the best we have to show,"
4777,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"A thousand Nibelungen, / to stand before their lord."""
4778,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Wherefore thus he wished it, / spake he never yet a word."
4779,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4780,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,502
4781,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4782,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The giant and Alberich / straightway he unbound.
4783,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Then ran Alberich quickly / where the knights he found.
4784,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,The warriors of Nibelung / he wakened full of fear.
4785,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Quoth he: ""Be up, ye heroes, / before Siegfried shall ye appear."""
4786,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4787,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,503
4788,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4789,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"From their couches sprang they / and ready were full soon,"
4790,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Clothed well in armor / a thousand warriors boon,"
4791,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And went where they found standing / Siegfried their lord.
4792,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Then was a mickle greeting / courteously in act and word.
4793,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4794,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,504
4795,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4796,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Candles many were lighted, / and sparkling wine he drank."
4797,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"That they came so quickly, / therefor he all did thank."
4798,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Quoth he: ""Now shall ye with me / from hence across the flood."""
4799,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Thereto he found full ready / the heroes valiant and good.
4800,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4801,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,505
4802,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4803,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Good thirty hundred warriors / soon had hither pressed,"
4804,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,From whom were then a thousand / taken of the best.
4805,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,For them were brought their helmets / and what they else did need.
4806,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,For unto Brunhild's country / would he straightway the warriors lead.
4807,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4808,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,506
4809,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4810,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"He spake: ""Ye goodly nobles, / that would I have you hear,"
4811,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"In full costly raiment / shall ye at court appear,"

4813,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Therefore shall your bodies / dight in good apparel be."""
4814,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4815,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,507
4816,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4817,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Upon a morning early / went they on their way.
4818,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,What host of brave companions / bore Siegfried company!
4819,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Good steeds took they with them / and garments rich to wear,"
4820,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,And did in courtly fashion / unto Brunhild's country fare.
4821,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4822,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,508
4823,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4824,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"As gazed from lofty parapet / women fair to see,"
4825,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Spake the queen unto them: / ""Knows any who they be,"

4827,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Rich sails their ships do carry, / whiter than snow they are."""
4828,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4829,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,509
4830,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4831,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the king of Rhineland: / ""My good men they are,"

4834,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,With full great amazing / were the stately strangers seen.
4835,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4836,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,510
4837,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4838,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,There saw they Siegfried / out on the ship's prow stand

4840,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake Queen Brunhild: / ""Good monarch, let me know,"

4842,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4843,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,511

4846,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"So that we see them gladly / they may surely know."""
4847,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Then did the royal lady / fulfil the king's behest.
4848,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Yet Siegfried in the greeting / was not honored with the rest.
4849,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4850,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,512
4851,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4852,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Lodgings were made ready / and their armor ta'en in hand.

4855,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Then would the knights full valiant / homeward fare to Burgundy.
4856,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
4857,EIGHTH ADVENTURE,513

5059,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5060,NINTH ADVENTURE,541

5117,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5118,NINTH ADVENTURE,Giselher the valiant / unto his mother kind

5128,NINTH ADVENTURE,Yet mickle sad forebodings / did trouble still the ladies twain.
5129,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5130,NINTH ADVENTURE,551
5131,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5132,NINTH ADVENTURE,They sprang for their attire / and donned it nothing slow.
5133,NINTH ADVENTURE,Then bade they that Siegfried / to court should thither go.

5138,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5139,NINTH ADVENTURE,"""Welcome be, Sir Siegfried, / thou knight right praiseworthy."
5140,NINTH ADVENTURE,Yet where may King Gunther / my noble brother be?

5165,NINTH ADVENTURE,556
5166,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5167,NINTH ADVENTURE,"She bade the knight be seated, / which he did willingly."

5180,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5181,NINTH ADVENTURE,"Four and twenty armlets / with stones of precious kind,"
5182,NINTH ADVENTURE,"These gave she him for guerdon. / 'Twas not the hero's mind,"
5183,NINTH ADVENTURE,That he himself should keep them: / he dealt them all around

5185,NINTH ADVENTURE,
5186,NINTH ADVENTURE,559

5332,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5333,TENTH ADVENTURE,579
5334,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5335,TENTH ADVENTURE,"On yonder side Rhine river / they saw a stately band,"
5336,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The king and host of strangers, / ride down unto the strand,"
5337,TENTH ADVENTURE,And also many a lady / sitting on charger led.
5338,TENTH ADVENTURE,By those who should receive them / was goodly preparation made.
5339,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5340,TENTH ADVENTURE,580
5341,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5342,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Soon they of Isenland / the ship had entered then,"
5343,TENTH ADVENTURE,And with them Siegfried's vassals / the Nibelungen men;
5344,TENTH ADVENTURE,They strained unto the shore / with untiring hand
5345,TENTH ADVENTURE,When they beheld the monarch's / friends upon the farther strand.
5346,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5347,TENTH ADVENTURE,581

5352,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then came to know each other / full many a knight and fair lady.
5353,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5354,TENTH ADVENTURE,582
5355,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5356,TENTH ADVENTURE,The Margrave Gere / but to the castle gate
5357,TENTH ADVENTURE,The bridle held for Kriemhild; / the keen Siegfried did wait
5358,TENTH ADVENTURE,Thenceforward upon her. / She was a beauteous maid.
5359,TENTH ADVENTURE,Well was the knight's good service / by the lady since repaid.

5361,TENTH ADVENTURE,583
5362,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5363,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Ortwein the valiant / Queen Ute rode beside,"
5364,TENTH ADVENTURE,And many a knight full gallant / was stately lady's guide.
5365,TENTH ADVENTURE,"At such a high reception, / that may we say, I ween,"
5366,TENTH ADVENTURE,Was ne'er such host of ladies / in company together seen.
5367,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5368,TENTH ADVENTURE,584
5369,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5370,TENTH ADVENTURE,"With show of rider's talent / the tilt was carried on,"

5379,TENTH ADVENTURE,Many a shaft go crashing / heard you there on shield.
5380,TENTH ADVENTURE,Heigh-ho! What din of costly / arms resounded o'er the field.
5381,TENTH ADVENTURE,

5383,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5384,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The full lovely maidens / upon the shore did stand,"
5385,TENTH ADVENTURE,As Gunther with the strangers / stepped upon the land;
5386,TENTH ADVENTURE,He himself did Brunhild / by the hand lead on.
5387,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then sparkled towards each other / rich dress and many a shining stone.
5388,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5389,TENTH ADVENTURE,587
5390,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5391,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then went Lady Kriemhild / with fullest courtesy due,"
5392,TENTH ADVENTURE,To greet the Lady Brunhild / and her retinue.
5393,TENTH ADVENTURE,And saw ye each the head-band / with fair hand move aside
5394,TENTH ADVENTURE,When they kissed each other: / high courtesy did the ladies guide.
5395,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5396,TENTH ADVENTURE,588

5402,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5403,TENTH ADVENTURE,589
5404,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5405,TENTH ADVENTURE,Within their arms the ladies / oft-times clasped each other.
5406,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Like this fond reception / heard ye of ne'er another,"
5407,TENTH ADVENTURE,"As when both the ladies / there the bride did greet,"
5408,TENTH ADVENTURE,Queen Ute and her daughter; / oft-times they kissed her lips so sweet.
5409,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5410,TENTH ADVENTURE,590
5411,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5412,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When all of Brunhild's ladies / were come upon the strand,"
5413,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then was there taken / full fondly by the hand
5414,TENTH ADVENTURE,By the warriors stately / many a fair lady.
5415,TENTH ADVENTURE,Before the Lady Brunhild / the train of fair maids might ye see.
5416,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5417,TENTH ADVENTURE,591
5418,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5419,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Before their greetings ended / a mickle time was gone,"
5420,TENTH ADVENTURE,"For lips of rosy color / were kissed there, many a one."
5421,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Long stood they together, / the royal ladies high,"
5422,TENTH ADVENTURE,And so to look upon them / pleased many a noble warrior's eye.
5423,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5424,TENTH ADVENTURE,592
5425,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5426,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spied with probing eye, too, / who before did hear"
5427,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That till then was never / aught beheld so fair,"
5428,TENTH ADVENTURE,As those two royal ladies: / they found it was no lie.
5429,TENTH ADVENTURE,In all their person might ye / no manner of deceit espy.
5430,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5431,TENTH ADVENTURE,593
5432,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5433,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Who there could spy fair ladies / and judge of beauty rare,"
5434,TENTH ADVENTURE,They praised the wife of Gunther / that she was passing fair;
5435,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Yet spake again the wise men / who looked with keener gaze,"
5436,TENTH ADVENTURE,They rather would to Kriemhild / before Brunhild award the praise.
5437,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5438,TENTH ADVENTURE,594
5439,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5440,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then went unto each other / maid and fair lady.
5441,TENTH ADVENTURE,Full many a fair one might ye / in rich adornment see.
5442,TENTH ADVENTURE,"There stood rich tents a many, / silken great and small,"
5443,TENTH ADVENTURE,Wherewith in every quarter / 'fore Worms the field was covered all.
5444,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5445,TENTH ADVENTURE,595
5446,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5447,TENTH ADVENTURE,Of the king's high kindred / a mighty press there was.
5448,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then bade they Brunhild / and Kriemhild on to pass,"
5449,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And with them all the ladies, / where they in shade might be."
5450,TENTH ADVENTURE,Thither did bring them warriors / of the land of Burgundy.
5451,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5452,TENTH ADVENTURE,596
5453,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5454,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When now the strangers also / on horse sat every one,"
5455,TENTH ADVENTURE,Plenteous knightly tilting / at shield was there begun.
5456,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Above the field rose dust-clouds, / as had the country been"
5457,TENTH ADVENTURE,All in flames a-burning; / who bore the honors there was seen.
5458,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5459,TENTH ADVENTURE,597
5460,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5461,TENTH ADVENTURE,Looked on full many a maiden / as the knights did sport them so.
5462,TENTH ADVENTURE,Meseemeth that Sir Siegfried / full many a to-and-fro
5463,TENTH ADVENTURE,Did ride with his good followers / along 'fore many a tent.
5464,TENTH ADVENTURE,With him of Nibelungen / a thousand stately men there went.
5465,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5466,TENTH ADVENTURE,598
5467,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5468,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then came of Tronje Hagen, / whom the king did send;"
5469,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He bade in pleasing manner / the tourney have an end,"
5470,TENTH ADVENTURE,Before in dust be buried / all the ladies fair.
5471,TENTH ADVENTURE,And ready to obey him / soon the courteous strangers were.
5472,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5473,TENTH ADVENTURE,599
5474,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5475,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake Sir Gernot: / ""Now let the chargers stand,"
5476,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Until the air is cooler, / for we must be at hand"
5477,TENTH ADVENTURE,As escort for fair ladies / unto the stately hall;
5478,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And will the king take saddle, / so let him find you ready all."""
5479,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5480,TENTH ADVENTURE,600
5481,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5482,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When now the sound of tourney / o'er all the field was spent,"
5483,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then went for pleasant pastime / 'neath many a lofty tent
5484,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The knights unto the ladies, / and willing thither hied."
5485,TENTH ADVENTURE,And there they passed the hours / till such time as they thence should
5486,TENTH ADVENTURE,ride.
5487,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5488,TENTH ADVENTURE,601
5489,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5490,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Just before the evening / when the sun was in the west,"
5491,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And the air grew cooler, / no longer did they rest,"
5492,TENTH ADVENTURE,But both knights and ladies / unto the castle passed.
5493,TENTH ADVENTURE,And eyes in loving glances / on many a beauteous maid were cast.
5494,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5495,TENTH ADVENTURE,602
5496,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5497,TENTH ADVENTURE,"By hand of goodly warrior / many a coat was rent,"
5498,TENTH ADVENTURE,"For in the country's custom / they tourneyed as they went,"
5499,TENTH ADVENTURE,Until before the palace / the monarch did dismount.
5500,TENTH ADVENTURE,They tended fairest ladies / as knights high-spirited are wont.
5501,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5502,TENTH ADVENTURE,603
5503,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5504,TENTH ADVENTURE,After fairest greeting / the queens did part again.
5505,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Dame Ute and her daughter, / thither passed the twain"
5506,TENTH ADVENTURE,With train of fair attendants / unto a hall full wide.
5507,TENTH ADVENTURE,Din of merrymaking / heard ye there on every side.
5508,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5509,TENTH ADVENTURE,604
5510,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5511,TENTH ADVENTURE,Arranged were sitting-places / where the king would be
5512,TENTH ADVENTURE,With his guests at table. / By him might ye see
5513,TENTH ADVENTURE,Standing the fair Brunhild. / She wore a royal crown
5514,TENTH ADVENTURE,"In the monarch's country, / the which might well such mistress own."
5515,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5516,TENTH ADVENTURE,605
5517,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5518,TENTH ADVENTURE,Seats for all the people / at many a spacious board
5519,TENTH ADVENTURE,"There were, as saith the story, / where victuals rich were stored."
5520,TENTH ADVENTURE,How little there was lacking / of all that makes a feast!
5521,TENTH ADVENTURE,And by the monarch saw ye / sitting many a stately guest.
5522,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5523,TENTH ADVENTURE,606
5524,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5525,TENTH ADVENTURE,The royal host's attendants / in basins golden red
5526,TENTH ADVENTURE,Carried water forward. / And should it e'er be said
5527,TENTH ADVENTURE,By any that a better / service did receive
5528,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Ever guests of monarch, / I never could such thing believe."
5529,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5530,TENTH ADVENTURE,607
5531,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5532,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Before the lord of Rhineland / with water was waited on,"
5533,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto him Sir Siegfried, / as fitting was, had gone;"
5534,TENTH ADVENTURE,He called to mind a promise / that made by him had been
5535,TENTH ADVENTURE,Ere that the Lady Brunhild / afar in Isenland he'd seen.
5536,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5537,TENTH ADVENTURE,608
5538,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5539,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He spake: ""Thou shalt bethink thee / what once did plight thy hand,"
5540,TENTH ADVENTURE,"If that the Lady Brunhild / should come unto this land,"
5541,TENTH ADVENTURE,Thou'dst give to me thy sister. / Where now what thou hast sworn?
5542,TENTH ADVENTURE,"In this thy wooing journey / not small the labor I have borne."""
5543,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5544,TENTH ADVENTURE,609
5545,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5546,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then to his guest the monarch: / ""Well hast thou minded me,"
5547,TENTH ADVENTURE,And by this hand shall never / false word plighted be.
5548,TENTH ADVENTURE,"To gain thy wish I'd help thee / in the way as best I know."""
5549,TENTH ADVENTURE,Bidden then was Kriemhild / forth unto the king to go.
5550,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5551,TENTH ADVENTURE,610
5552,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5553,TENTH ADVENTURE,With her full beauteous maidens / unto the Hall she passed.
5554,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then sprang the youthful Giselher / adown the steps in haste
5555,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Bid now these many maidens / wend their way again;"
5556,TENTH ADVENTURE,"None but my sister only / unto the king shall enter in."""
5557,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5558,TENTH ADVENTURE,611
5559,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5560,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then led they Kriemhild thither / where the king was found,"
5561,TENTH ADVENTURE,With him were knights full noble / from many a land around.
5562,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Within that Hall so spacious / she waited the king's behest,"
5563,TENTH ADVENTURE,What time the Lady Brunhild / betook her likewise to the feast.
5564,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5565,TENTH ADVENTURE,612
5566,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5567,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the royal Gunther: / ""Sister mine full fair,"
5568,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Redeem the word I've given, / an hold'st thou virtue dear."
5569,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Thee to a knight I plighted: / An tak'st thou him to man,"
5570,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereby my wish full truly / unto the warrior hast thou done."""
5571,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5572,TENTH ADVENTURE,613
5573,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5574,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the noble maiden: / ""Brother full dear to me,"
5575,TENTH ADVENTURE,Not long shalt thou entreat me. / In truth I'll ever be
5576,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Obedient to thy bidding; / that shall now be done,"
5577,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And him I'll take full gladly, / my Lord, whom thou giv'st me for man."""
5578,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5579,TENTH ADVENTURE,614
5580,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5581,TENTH ADVENTURE,Before those fair eyes' glances / grew Siegfried's color red.
5582,TENTH ADVENTURE,The knight to Lady Kriemhild / his service offered.
5583,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Within a ring together / then were led the twain,"
5584,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And they asked the maiden, / if she to take the knight were fain."
5585,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5586,TENTH ADVENTURE,615
5587,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5588,TENTH ADVENTURE,Upon her face not little / was the modest glow;
5589,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Nathless to joy of Siegfried / did fortune will it so,"
5590,TENTH ADVENTURE,That the maiden would not / refuse the knight her hand.
5591,TENTH ADVENTURE,Eke swore his wife to make her / the noble king of Netherland.
5592,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5593,TENTH ADVENTURE,616
5594,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5595,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When he to her had plighted, / and eke to him the maid,"
5596,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Siegfried to embrace her / nothing more delayed,"
5597,TENTH ADVENTURE,"But clasped in arms full fondly / and oft the lady fair,"
5598,TENTH ADVENTURE,And stately knights were witness / how that he kissed the princess there.
5599,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5600,TENTH ADVENTURE,617
5601,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5602,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When that the maids attendant / from thence had ta'en their leave,"
5603,TENTH ADVENTURE,In place of honor seated / Siegfried might ye perceive
5604,TENTH ADVENTURE,And by him fairest Kriemhild; / and many a knight at hand
5605,TENTH ADVENTURE,Was seen of the Nibelungen / at Siegfried's service ready stand.
5606,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5607,TENTH ADVENTURE,618
5608,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5609,TENTH ADVENTURE,There too was Gunther seated / and with him Queen Brunhild.
5610,TENTH ADVENTURE,At sight of Kriemhild sitting / by Siegfried was she filled
5611,TENTH ADVENTURE,With anger such as never / before her heart did swell:
5612,TENTH ADVENTURE,"She wept, and tears in plenty / adown her shining face there fell."
5613,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5614,TENTH ADVENTURE,619
5615,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5616,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake who ruled the country: / ""What aileth, lady mine,"

5620,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5621,TENTH ADVENTURE,620

5627,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5628,TENTH ADVENTURE,621
5629,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5630,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then answered her King Gunther: / ""But for the nonce be still."
5631,TENTH ADVENTURE,"At other time more fitting / the thing to thee I'll tell,"
5632,TENTH ADVENTURE,Wherefore thus my sister / to Siegfried I did give.
5633,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And truly with the hero / may she ever joyous live."""
5634,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5635,TENTH ADVENTURE,622
5636,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5637,TENTH ADVENTURE,"She spake: ""Her name and beauty / thus lost it grieveth me."
5638,TENTH ADVENTURE,"An knew I only whither, / from hence I'd surely flee,"
5639,TENTH ADVENTURE,"This night nor e'er hereafter / to share thy royal bed,"
5640,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Say'st thou not truly wherefore / Kriemhild thus hath Siegfried wed."""
5641,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5642,TENTH ADVENTURE,623
5643,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5644,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the noble monarch: / ""Then unto thee be known"
5645,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That he as stately castles, / lands wide as I, doth own."
5646,TENTH ADVENTURE,And know thou that full surely / a mighty monarch he;
5647,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Wherefore the fairest maiden / I grant him thus his wife to be."""
5648,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5649,TENTH ADVENTURE,624
5650,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5651,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Whate'er the king did tell her, / sad was she yet of mood."
5652,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then hastened from the tables / full many a warrior good,"
5653,TENTH ADVENTURE,And jousted that the castle / walls gave back the din.
5654,TENTH ADVENTURE,Amid his guests the monarch / waiting longingly was seen.
5655,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5656,TENTH ADVENTURE,625
5657,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5658,TENTH ADVENTURE,He deemed 'twere better lying / beside his fair lady.
5659,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Of thinking on that plaisance / his mind he could not free,"
5660,TENTH ADVENTURE,And what her love would bring him / before the night be past;
5661,TENTH ADVENTURE,He many a glance full tender / upon the Lady Brunhild cast.
5662,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5663,TENTH ADVENTURE,626
5664,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5665,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The guests they bade give over / in joust who combated,"
5666,TENTH ADVENTURE,For that with spouse new-wedded / the monarch would to bed.
5667,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Leaving then the banquet, / there together met"
5668,TENTH ADVENTURE,Kriemhild and Brunhild: / their bitter hate was silent yet.
5669,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5670,TENTH ADVENTURE,627
5671,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5672,TENTH ADVENTURE,"At hand were their attendants; / they longer tarried not,"
5673,TENTH ADVENTURE,And chamberlains full lordly / lights for them had brought.
5674,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then parted eke the followers / of the monarchs twain,"
5675,TENTH ADVENTURE,And bearing Siegfried company / went full many a worthy thane.
5676,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5677,TENTH ADVENTURE,628
5678,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5679,TENTH ADVENTURE,The lords were both come thither / where that they should lie.
5680,TENTH ADVENTURE,As each one bethought him / of loving victory
5681,TENTH ADVENTURE,"To win o'er winsome lady, / merry he grew of mood."
5682,TENTH ADVENTURE,The noble Siegfried's pastime / it was beyond all measure good.
5683,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5684,TENTH ADVENTURE,629
5685,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5686,TENTH ADVENTURE,As there Sir Siegfried / by fair Kriemhild lay
5687,TENTH ADVENTURE,And to the maid devoted / himself in such fond way
5688,TENTH ADVENTURE,"As noble knight beseemeth, / they twain to him were one,"
5689,TENTH ADVENTURE,And not a thousand others / had he then ta'en for her alone.
5690,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5691,TENTH ADVENTURE,630
5692,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5693,TENTH ADVENTURE,"I'll tell you now no further / how he the lady plied,"
5694,TENTH ADVENTURE,But list ye first the story / what Gunther did betide
5695,TENTH ADVENTURE,By Lady Brunhild lying. / In sooth the noble thane
5696,TENTH ADVENTURE,By side of other ladies / a deal more happily had lain.
5697,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5698,TENTH ADVENTURE,631
5699,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5700,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Withdrawn were now attendants, / man and also maid;"
5701,TENTH ADVENTURE,Not long to lock the chamber / within the king delayed.
5702,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He weened to have good pleasure / of that fair lady,"
5703,TENTH ADVENTURE,Yet was the time still distant / when that she his wife should be.
5704,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5705,TENTH ADVENTURE,632
5706,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5707,TENTH ADVENTURE,In gown of whitest linen / unto the bed she passed.
5708,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then thought the knight full noble: / ""Now have I here at last"
5709,TENTH ADVENTURE,"All that I e'er desired / as long as I can tell."""
5710,TENTH ADVENTURE,Perforce her stately beauty / did please the monarch passing well.
5711,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5712,TENTH ADVENTURE,633
5713,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5714,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That they should shine more dimly / he placed the lights aside,"
5715,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then where did lie the lady / the thane full eager hied.
5716,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He placed himself a-nigh her, / his joy right great it was,"
5717,TENTH ADVENTURE,As in his arms the monarch / the winsome maid did there embrace.
5718,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5719,TENTH ADVENTURE,634
5720,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5721,TENTH ADVENTURE,A loving plaisance had he / with vigor there begun
5722,TENTH ADVENTURE,If that the noble lady / had let the same be done.
5723,TENTH ADVENTURE,She then did rage so sorely / that grieved was he thereat;
5724,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He weened to find who loved him, / --instead he found him naught but"
5725,TENTH ADVENTURE,hate.
5726,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5727,TENTH ADVENTURE,635
5728,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5729,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake she: ""Good knight and noble, / from this thing give o'er."
5730,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That which thou here hast hope of, / it may be nevermore."
5731,TENTH ADVENTURE,A maid I still will keep me / --well mayest thou know that--
5732,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Until I learn that story."" / Gunther wrathy grew thereat."
5733,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5734,TENTH ADVENTURE,636
5735,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5736,TENTH ADVENTURE,Her gown he wrought to ruin / to win her maidenhead.
5737,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Whereat did seize a girdle / the full stately maid,"
5738,TENTH ADVENTURE,"A strong and silken girdle / that round her sides she wore,"
5739,TENTH ADVENTURE,And with the same the monarch / she soon had brought to pains full sore.
5740,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5741,TENTH ADVENTURE,637
5742,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5743,TENTH ADVENTURE,"His feet and his hands also, / together bound she all,"
5744,TENTH ADVENTURE,Unto a nail she bore him / and hung him on the wall.
5745,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Him who disturbed her sleeping / in his love she sorely let,"
5746,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And from her mighty prowess, / he full nigh his death had met."
5747,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5748,TENTH ADVENTURE,638
5749,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5750,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then gan he to entreat her, / who master late had been."
5751,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""From these my bonds now loose me, / my full noble queen."
5752,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Nor trow I e'er, fair lady, / victor o'er thee to be,"
5753,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And henceforth will I seldom / seek to lie thus nigh to thee."""
5754,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5755,TENTH ADVENTURE,639
5756,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5757,TENTH ADVENTURE,"She recked not how 'twere with him, / as she full softly lay."
5758,TENTH ADVENTURE,"There hung he, will he nill he, / the night through unto day,"
5759,TENTH ADVENTURE,Until the light of morning / through the windows shone.
5760,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Could he e'er boast of prowess, / small now the measure he did own."
5761,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5762,TENTH ADVENTURE,640
5763,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5764,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now tell me, lordly Gunther, / wert thou thereat so sad,"
5765,TENTH ADVENTURE,"If that in bonds should find thee"" / --spake the fairest maid--"
5766,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Thy royal men-in-waiting, / bound by lady's hand?"""
5767,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the knight full noble: / ""Thou should'st in case most evil"
5768,TENTH ADVENTURE,stand.
5769,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5770,TENTH ADVENTURE,641
5771,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5772,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Eke had I little honor / therefrom,"" continued he."
5773,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""For all thy royal honor / let me then go to thee."
5774,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Since that my fond embracements / do anger thee so sore,"
5775,TENTH ADVENTURE,"With these my hands I pledge thee / to touch thy garment nevermore."""
5776,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5777,TENTH ADVENTURE,642
5778,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5779,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then she loosed him straightway / and he once more stood free.
5780,TENTH ADVENTURE,To the bed he went as erstwhile / where rested his lady.
5781,TENTH ADVENTURE,But far from her he laid him / and well he now forebore
5782,TENTH ADVENTURE,To stir the lady's anger / by touching e'en the gown she wore.
5783,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5784,TENTH ADVENTURE,643
5785,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5786,TENTH ADVENTURE,"At length came their attendants / who garments fresh did bring,"
5787,TENTH ADVENTURE,Whereof was ready for them / good store on that morning.
5788,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Yet merry as his folk were, / a visage sad did own"
5789,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The lord of that proud country, / for all he wore that day a crown."
5790,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5791,TENTH ADVENTURE,644
5792,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5793,TENTH ADVENTURE,"As was the country's custom, / a thing folk do of right,"
5794,TENTH ADVENTURE,Gunther and Brunhild / presently were dight
5795,TENTH ADVENTURE,To go unto the minster / where the mass was sung.
5796,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Thither eke came Siegfried, / and in their trains a mighty throng."
5797,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5798,TENTH ADVENTURE,645
5799,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5800,TENTH ADVENTURE,As fitted royal honor / for them was thither brought
5801,TENTH ADVENTURE,The crown that each should carry / and garments richly wrought.
5802,TENTH ADVENTURE,"There were they consecrated; / and when the same was done,"
5803,TENTH ADVENTURE,Saw ye the four together / happy stand and wearing crown.
5804,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5805,TENTH ADVENTURE,646
5806,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5807,TENTH ADVENTURE,"There was knighted many a squire, / --six hundred or beyond--"
5808,TENTH ADVENTURE,"In honor of the crowning, / that shall ye understand."
5809,TENTH ADVENTURE,Arose full great rejoicing / in the land of Burgundy
5810,TENTH ADVENTURE,As hand of youthful warrior / did shatter shaft right valiantly.
5811,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5812,TENTH ADVENTURE,647
5813,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5814,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then sat in castle casement / maidens fair to see,"
5815,TENTH ADVENTURE,And many a shield beneath them / gleamed full brilliantly.
5816,TENTH ADVENTURE,Yet himself had sundered / from all his men the king;
5817,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Though joyous every other, / sad-visaged stood he sorrowing."
5818,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5819,TENTH ADVENTURE,648
5820,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5821,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He and the doughty Siegfried, / how all unlike their mood!"
5822,TENTH ADVENTURE,Well wist the thing did grieve him / that noble knight and good.
5823,TENTH ADVENTURE,He went unto the monarch / and straight addressed him so:
5824,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""This night how hast thou fared? / In friendship give thou me to know."""
5825,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5826,TENTH ADVENTURE,649
5827,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5828,TENTH ADVENTURE,"To his guest the king gave answer: / ""Than shame and scathe I've naught."
5829,TENTH ADVENTURE,The devil's dam I surely / into my house have brought.
5830,TENTH ADVENTURE,When as I thought to have her / she bound me like a thrall;
5831,TENTH ADVENTURE,Unto a nail she bore me / and hung me high upon the wall.
5832,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5833,TENTH ADVENTURE,650
5834,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5835,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""There hung I sore in anguish / the night through until day"
5836,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Ere that she would unbind me, / the while she softly lay!"
5837,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And hast thou friendly pity / know then the grief I bear."""
5838,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the doughty Siegfried: / ""Such grieves me verily to hear."
5839,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5840,TENTH ADVENTURE,651
5841,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5842,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""The which I'll show thee truly, / wilt thou me not deny."
5843,TENTH ADVENTURE,I'll bring it that to-night she / so near to thee shall lie
5844,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That she to meet thy wishes / shall tarry nevermore."""
5845,TENTH ADVENTURE,Thereat rejoice did Gunther / to think perchance his trials o'er.
5846,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5847,TENTH ADVENTURE,652
5848,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5849,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then further spake Sir Siegfried: / ""With thee 'twill yet be right."
5850,TENTH ADVENTURE,I ween that all unequal / we twain have fared this night.
5851,TENTH ADVENTURE,To me thy sister Kriemhild / dearer is than life;
5852,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Eke shall the Lady Brunhild / be yet this coming night thy wife."""
5853,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5854,TENTH ADVENTURE,653
5855,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5856,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""I'll come unto thy chamber / this night all secretly,"""
5857,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake he, ""and wrapped in mantle / invisible I'll be,"
5858,TENTH ADVENTURE,That of this my cunning / naught shall any know;
5859,TENTH ADVENTURE,And thy attendants shalt thou / bid to their apartments go.
5860,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5861,TENTH ADVENTURE,654
5862,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5863,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""The lights I'll all extinguish / held by each page in hand,"
5864,TENTH ADVENTURE,By the which same token / shalt thou understand
5865,TENTH ADVENTURE,I present am to serve thee. / I'll tame thy shrewish wife
5866,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That thou this night enjoy her, / else forfeit be my caitiff life."""
5867,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5868,TENTH ADVENTURE,655
5869,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5870,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""An thou wilt truly leave me"" / --answered him the king--"
5871,TENTH ADVENTURE,"'My lady yet a maiden, / I joy o'er this same thing."
5872,TENTH ADVENTURE,"So do thou as thou willest; / and takest thou her life,"
5873,TENTH ADVENTURE,"E'en that I'll let pass o'er me, / --to lose so terrible a wife."""
5874,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5875,TENTH ADVENTURE,656
5876,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5877,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Thereto,"" spake then Siegfried, / ""plight I word of mine,"
5878,TENTH ADVENTURE,To leave her yet a maiden. / A sister fair of thine
5879,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Is to me before all women / I ever yet have seen."""
5880,TENTH ADVENTURE,Gunther believed right gladly / what had by Siegfried plighted been.
5881,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5882,TENTH ADVENTURE,657
5883,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5884,TENTH ADVENTURE,Meanwhile the merry pastime / with joy and zest went on.
5885,TENTH ADVENTURE,"But all the din and bustle / bade they soon be done,"
5886,TENTH ADVENTURE,When band of fairest ladies / would pass unto the hall
5887,TENTH ADVENTURE,'Fore whom did royal chamberlains / bid backward stand the people all.
5888,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5889,TENTH ADVENTURE,658
5890,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5891,TENTH ADVENTURE,The chargers soon and riders / from castle court were sped.
5892,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Each of the noble ladies / by bishop high was led,"
5893,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When that before the monarchs / they passed to banquet board,"
5894,TENTH ADVENTURE,And in their train did follow / to table many a stately lord.
5895,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5896,TENTH ADVENTURE,659
5897,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5898,TENTH ADVENTURE,There sat the king all hopeful / and full of merriment;
5899,TENTH ADVENTURE,"What him did promise Siegfried, / thereon his mind was bent."
5900,TENTH ADVENTURE,To him as long as thirty / did seem that single day;
5901,TENTH ADVENTURE,"To plaisance with his lady, / thither turned his thought alway."
5902,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5903,TENTH ADVENTURE,660
5904,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5905,TENTH ADVENTURE,And scarce the time he bided / while that the feast did last.
5906,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Now unto her chamber / the stately Brunhild passed,"
5907,TENTH ADVENTURE,And for her couch did Kriemhild / likewise the table leave.
5908,TENTH ADVENTURE,Before those royal ladies / what host ye saw of warriors brave!
5909,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5910,TENTH ADVENTURE,661
5911,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5912,TENTH ADVENTURE,Full soon thereafter Siegfried / sat right lovingly
5913,TENTH ADVENTURE,"With his fair wife beside him, / and naught but joy had he."
5914,TENTH ADVENTURE,"His hand she clasped full fondly / within her hand so white,"
5915,TENTH ADVENTURE,Until--and how she knew not-- / he did vanish from her sight.
5916,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5917,TENTH ADVENTURE,662
5918,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5919,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When she the knight did fondle, / and straightway saw him not,"
5920,TENTH ADVENTURE,Unto her maids attendant / spake the queen distraught:
5921,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Meseemeth a mickle wonder / where now the king hath gone."
5922,TENTH ADVENTURE,"His hands in such weird fashion / who now from out mine own hath drawn?"""
5923,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5924,TENTH ADVENTURE,663
5925,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5926,TENTH ADVENTURE,Yet further not she questioned. / Soon had he hither gone
5927,TENTH ADVENTURE,Where with lights were standing / attendants many a one.
5928,TENTH ADVENTURE,The same he did extinguish / in every page's hand;
5929,TENTH ADVENTURE,That Siegfried then was present / Gunther thereby did understand.
5930,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5931,TENTH ADVENTURE,664
5932,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5933,TENTH ADVENTURE,Well wist he what he would there; / so bade he thence be gone
5934,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Ladies and maids-in-waiting. / And when that was done,"
5935,TENTH ADVENTURE,Himself the mighty monarch / fast did lock the door:
5936,TENTH ADVENTURE,Two bolts all wrought securely / he quickly shoved the same before.
5937,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5938,TENTH ADVENTURE,665
5939,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5940,TENTH ADVENTURE,The lights behind the curtains / hid he presently.
5941,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Soon a play was started / (for thus it had to be),"
5942,TENTH ADVENTURE,Betwixt the doughty Siegfried / and the stately maid:
5943,TENTH ADVENTURE,Thereat was royal Gunther / joyous alike and sad.
5944,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5945,TENTH ADVENTURE,666
5946,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5947,TENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried there laid him / by the maid full near.
5948,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake she: ""Let be, now, Gunther, / an hast thou cause to fear"
5949,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Those troubles now repeated / which befell thee yesternight."""
5950,TENTH ADVENTURE,And soon the valiant Siegfried / through the lady fell in sorry plight.
5951,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5952,TENTH ADVENTURE,667
5953,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5954,TENTH ADVENTURE,His voice did he keep under / and ne'er a word spake he.
5955,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Intently listened Gunther, / and though he naught could see,"
5956,TENTH ADVENTURE,Yet knew he that in secret / nothing 'twixt them passed.
5957,TENTH ADVENTURE,In sooth nor knight nor lady / upon the bed had mickle rest.
5958,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5959,TENTH ADVENTURE,668
5960,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5961,TENTH ADVENTURE,"He did there as if Gunther / the mighty king he were,"
5962,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And in his arms he pressed her, / the maiden debonair."
5963,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Forth from the bed she hurled him / where a bench there stood,"
5964,TENTH ADVENTURE,And head of valiant warrior / against a stool went ringing loud.
5965,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5966,TENTH ADVENTURE,669
5967,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5968,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Up sprang again undaunted / the full doughty man,"
5969,TENTH ADVENTURE,To try for fortune better. / When he anew began
5970,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Perforce to curb her fury, / fell he in trouble sore."
5971,TENTH ADVENTURE,I ween that ne'er a lady / did so defend herself before.
5972,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5973,TENTH ADVENTURE,670
5974,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5975,TENTH ADVENTURE,"When he would not give over, / up the maid arose:"
5976,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""My gown so white thou never / thus shalt discompose."
5977,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And this thy villain's manner / shall sore by thee be paid,"
5978,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The same I'll teach thee truly,"" / further spake the buxom maid."
5979,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5980,TENTH ADVENTURE,671
5981,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5982,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Within her arms she clasped him, / the full stately thane,"
5983,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And thought likewise to bind him, / as the king yestreen,"
5984,TENTH ADVENTURE,That she the night in quiet / upon her couch might lie.
5985,TENTH ADVENTURE,"That her dress he thus did rumple, / avenged the lady grievously."
5986,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5987,TENTH ADVENTURE,672
5988,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5989,TENTH ADVENTURE,What booted now his prowess / and eke his mickle might?
5990,TENTH ADVENTURE,Her sovereignty of body / she proved upon the knight;
5991,TENTH ADVENTURE,"By force of arm she bore him, / --'twixt wall and mighty chest"
5992,TENTH ADVENTURE,(For so it e'en must happen) / him she all ungently pressed.
5993,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5994,TENTH ADVENTURE,673
5995,TENTH ADVENTURE,
5996,TENTH ADVENTURE,"""Ah me!""--so thought the hero-- / ""shall I now my life"
5997,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Lose at hand of woman, / then will every wife"
5998,TENTH ADVENTURE,Evermore hereafter / a shrewish temper show
5999,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Against her lord's good wishes, / who now such thing ne'er thinks to do."""
6000,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6001,TENTH ADVENTURE,674
6002,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6003,TENTH ADVENTURE,All heard the monarch meanwhile / and trembled for the man.
6004,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Sore ashamed was Siegfried, / and a-raging he began."
6005,TENTH ADVENTURE,"With might and main he struggled / again to make him free,"
6006,TENTH ADVENTURE,Ere which to sorest trouble / 'neath Lady Brunhild's hand fell he.
6007,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6008,TENTH ADVENTURE,675
6009,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6010,TENTH ADVENTURE,Long space to him it seemed / ere Siegfried tamed her mood.
6011,TENTH ADVENTURE,She grasped his hand so tightly / that 'neath the nails the blood
6012,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Oozed from the pressure, / which made the hero wince."
6013,TENTH ADVENTURE,Yet the stately maiden / subdued he to obedience since.
6014,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6015,TENTH ADVENTURE,676
6016,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6017,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Her unrestrained temper / that she so late displayed,"
6018,TENTH ADVENTURE,"All overheard the monarch, / though ne'er a word he said."
6019,TENTH ADVENTURE,"'Gainst the bed did press her Siegfried / that aloud she cried,"
6020,TENTH ADVENTURE,Ungentle was the treatment / that he meted to the bride.
6021,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6022,TENTH ADVENTURE,677
6023,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6024,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Then grasped she for a girdle / that round her sides she wore,"
6025,TENTH ADVENTURE,And thought therewith to bind him; / but her limbs and body o'er
6026,TENTH ADVENTURE,Strained beneath the vigor / that his strong arm displayed.
6027,TENTH ADVENTURE,So was the struggle ended / --Gunther's wife was vanquished.
6028,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6029,TENTH ADVENTURE,678
6030,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6031,TENTH ADVENTURE,"She spake: ""O noble monarch, / take not my life away."
6032,TENTH ADVENTURE,The harm that I have done thee / full well will I repay.
6033,TENTH ADVENTURE,"No more thy royal embraces / by me shall be withstood,"
6034,TENTH ADVENTURE,"For now I well have seen it, / thou canst be lord o'er woman's mood."""
6035,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6036,TENTH ADVENTURE,679
6037,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6038,TENTH ADVENTURE,"From the couch rose Siegfried, / lying he left the maid,"
6039,TENTH ADVENTURE,As if that he would from him / lay his clothes aside.
6040,TENTH ADVENTURE,He drew from off her finger / a ring of golden sheen
6041,TENTH ADVENTURE,Without that e'er perceived / his practice the full noble queen.
6042,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6043,TENTH ADVENTURE,680
6044,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6045,TENTH ADVENTURE,Thereto he took her girdle / that was all richly wrought:
6046,TENTH ADVENTURE,"If from wanton spirit / he did it, know I not."
6047,TENTH ADVENTURE,The same he gave to Kriemhild: / the which did sorrow bear.
6048,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then lay by one another / Gunther and the maiden fair.
6049,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6050,TENTH ADVENTURE,681
6051,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6052,TENTH ADVENTURE,Hearty were his embraces / as such king became:
6053,TENTH ADVENTURE,Perforce must she relinquish / her anger and her shame.
6054,TENTH ADVENTURE,"In sooth not little pallid / within his arms she grew,"
6055,TENTH ADVENTURE,And in that love-surrender / how waned her mighty prowess too!
6056,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6057,TENTH ADVENTURE,682
6058,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6059,TENTH ADVENTURE,Then was e'en she not stronger / than e'er another bride;
6060,TENTH ADVENTURE,He lay with fond embraces / the beauteous dame beside.
6061,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And had she struggled further, / avail how could it aught?"
6062,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther, when thus he clasped her, / such change upon her strength had"
6063,TENTH ADVENTURE,wrought.
6064,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6065,TENTH ADVENTURE,683
6066,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6067,TENTH ADVENTURE,And with right inward pleasure / she too beside him lay
6068,TENTH ADVENTURE,In warmest love embracings / until the dawn of day!
6069,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Meantime now had Siegfried / departure ta'en from there,"
6070,TENTH ADVENTURE,And was full well received / by a lady debonair.
6071,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6072,TENTH ADVENTURE,684
6073,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6074,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Her questioning he avoided / and all whereon she thought,"
6075,TENTH ADVENTURE,"And long time kept he secret / what he for her had brought,"
6076,TENTH ADVENTURE,Until in his own country / she wore a royal crown;
6077,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Yet what for her he destined, / how sure at last it was her own."
6078,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6079,TENTH ADVENTURE,685
6080,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6081,TENTH ADVENTURE,Upon the morn was Gunther / by far of better mood
6082,TENTH ADVENTURE,Than he had been before it; / joy thus did spread abroad
6083,TENTH ADVENTURE,'Mid host of knights full noble / that from his lands around
6084,TENTH ADVENTURE,"To his court had been invited, / and there most willing service found."
6085,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6086,TENTH ADVENTURE,686
6087,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6088,TENTH ADVENTURE,"The merry time there lasted / until two weeks were spent,"
6089,TENTH ADVENTURE,Nor all the while did flag there / the din of merriment
6090,TENTH ADVENTURE,And every kind of joyance / that knight could e'er devise;
6091,TENTH ADVENTURE,With lavish hand expended / the king thereto in fitting wise.
6092,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6093,TENTH ADVENTURE,687
6094,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6095,TENTH ADVENTURE,The noble monarch's kinsmen / upon his high command
6096,TENTH ADVENTURE,"By gifts of gold and raiment / told forth his generous hand,"
6097,TENTH ADVENTURE,By steed and thereto silver / on minstrel oft bestowed.
6098,TENTH ADVENTURE,Who there did gift desire / departed thence in merry mood.
6099,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6100,TENTH ADVENTURE,688
6101,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6102,TENTH ADVENTURE,"All the store of raiment / afar from Netherland,"
6103,TENTH ADVENTURE,The which had Siegfried's thousand / warriors brought to hand
6104,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto the Rhine there with them, / complete 'twas dealt away,"
6105,TENTH ADVENTURE,And eke the steeds well saddled: / in sooth a lordly life led they.
6106,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6107,TENTH ADVENTURE,689
6108,TENTH ADVENTURE,
6109,TENTH ADVENTURE,"Ere all the gifts so bounteous / were dealt the guests among,"
6110,TENTH ADVENTURE,They who would straightway homeward / did deem the waiting long.
6111,TENTH ADVENTURE,Ne'er had guests of monarch / such goodly gifts before;
6112,TENTH ADVENTURE,And so as Gunther willed it / the merry feast at last was o'er.
6113,TENTH ADVENTURE,

6117,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE
6118,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6119,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,How Siegfried came home with his Wife
6120,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6121,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,690
6122,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6123,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"When that now the strangers / all from thence were gone,"
6124,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Spake unto his followers / noble Siegmund's son:
6125,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""We shall eke make ready / home to my land to fare."""
6126,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Unto his spouse was welcome / such news when she the same did hear.
6127,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6128,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,691
6129,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6130,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"She spake unto her husband: / ""When shall we hence depart?"
6131,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Not hastily on the journey / I pray thee yet to start.
6132,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"With me first my brothers / their wide lands shall share."""
6133,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried yet it pleased not / such words from Kriemhild to hear.
6134,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6135,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,692
6136,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6137,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,The princes went unto him / and spake they there all three:
6138,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now know thou well, Sir Siegfried, / for thee shall ever be"
6139,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"In faithfulness our service / ready while yet we live."""
6140,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,The royal thanes then thanked he / who thus did proof of friendship give.
6141,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6142,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,693
6143,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6144,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""With thee further share we,"" / spake young Giselher,"
6145,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""The lands and eke the castles / by us that owned are."
6146,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"In wide lands whatsoever / we rule o'er warriors brave,"
6147,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Of the same with Kriemhild / a goodly portion shalt thou have.
6148,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6149,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,694
6150,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6151,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then spake unto the princes / the son of Siegmund
6152,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,When he their lofty purpose / did rightly understand:
6153,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""God grant your goodly heritage / at peace may ever be,"
6154,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And eke therein your people. / The spouse in sooth so dear to me."""
6155,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6156,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,695
6157,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6158,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""May well forego the portion / that ye to her would give."
6159,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"For she a crown shall carry, / if to such day I live,"
6160,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And queen more rich than any / that lives she then must be.
6161,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"What else to her ye offer, / therein I'll meet you faithfully."""
6162,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6163,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,696
6164,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6165,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: / ""If wealth thou wilt not choose,"
6166,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Yet gallant thanes of Burgundy / shalt thou not light refuse.
6167,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,They're such as monarch gladly / would lead to his own land.
6168,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Of these shall make division / with me my loving brothers' hand."""
6169,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6170,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,697
6171,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6172,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereto spake noble Gernot: / ""Now take to please thy mind."
6173,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Who gladly will go with thee / full many here thou'lt find.
6174,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Of thirty hundred warriors / we give thee thousand men
6175,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"To be thy royal escort."" / Kriemhild did summon then"
6176,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6177,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,698
6178,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6179,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Hagen of Tronje to her / and Ortwein instantly:
6180,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And would they and their kinsmen / make her good company?
6181,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,To hear the same did Hagen / begin to rage full sore.
6182,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Quoth he: ""E'en royal Gunther / may thus bestow us nevermore."
6183,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6184,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,699
6185,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6186,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Other men that serve thee, / let them follow thee;"
6187,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Thou know'st the men of Tronje / and what their pledges be:
6188,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Here must we by the monarchs / in service true abide;
6189,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Hereto as them we followed, / so shall we henceforth keep their side."""
6190,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6191,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,700
6192,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6193,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And so the thing was ended: / to part they ready make.
6194,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"A high and noble escort / did Kriemhild to her take,"
6195,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Maidens two and thirty / and five hundred men also.
6196,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,In Lady Kriemhild's company / the Margrave Eckewart did go.
6197,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6198,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,701
6199,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6200,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Leave took they all together, / squire and also knight,"
6201,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Maidens and fair ladies, / as was their wont aright."
6202,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,There parted they with kisses / and eke with clasp of hand:
6203,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Right merrily they journeyed / forth from royal Gunther's land.
6204,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6205,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,702
6206,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6207,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Their friends did give them escort / upon the way full far.
6208,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Night-quarters at every station / they bade for them prepare,"
6209,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Where they might wish to tarry / as on their way they went.
6210,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then straightway was a messenger / unto royal Siegmund sent,"
6211,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6212,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,703
6213,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6214,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,To him and Siegelind bearing / thereof the joyful sign
6215,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,That his son was coming / from Worms upon the Rhine
6216,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And with him Ute's daughter, / Kriemhild the fair lady."
6217,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,As this could other message / nevermore so welcome be.
6218,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6219,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,704
6220,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6221,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""Well is me!"" quoth Siegmund, / ""that I the day have known,"
6222,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,When the fair Lady Kriemhild / here shall wear a crown.
6223,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Thus higher shall my kingdom / stand in majesty.
6224,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"My son the noble Siegfried / here himself the king shall be."""
6225,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6226,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,705
6227,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6228,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then dealt the Lady Siegelind / velvet red in store,"
6229,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Silver and gold full heavy / to them the news that bore:
6230,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,She joyed to hear the story / that there her ear did greet.
6231,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then decked themselves her ladies / all in rich attire meet.
6232,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6233,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,706
6234,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6235,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"'Twas told, with Siegfried coming / whom they did expect."
6236,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Then bade they sitting-places / straightway to erect,"
6237,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Where he before his kinsmen / a crown in state should wear.
6238,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then men of royal Siegmund / forward rode to meet him there.
6239,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6240,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,707
6241,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6242,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Was e'er more royal greeting, / news have I not to hand,"
6243,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,As came the knights full noble / into Siegmund's land.
6244,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,There the royal Siegelind / to Kriemhild forth did ride
6245,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"With ladies fair a many, / and followed gallant knights beside"
6246,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6247,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,708
6248,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6249,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Out a full day's journey / to welcome each high guest.
6250,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And little with the strangers / did they ever rest
6251,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Until into a castle / wide they came once more,"
6252,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The same was called Xanten, / where anon a crown they wore."
6253,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6254,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,709
6255,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6256,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,With smiling lips Dame Siegelind / --and Siegmund eke did this--
6257,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"To show the love they bore her / full oft did Kriemhild kiss,"
6258,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And eke the royal Siegfried: / far was their sorrow gone.
6259,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And all the merry company, / good welcome had they every one."
6260,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6261,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,710
6262,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6263,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The train of strangers bade they / 'fore Siegmund's Hall to lead,"
6264,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And maidens fair a many / down from gallant steed
6265,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Helped they there dismounting. / Full many a man was there
6266,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,To do them willing service / as was meet for ladies fair.
6267,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6268,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,711
6269,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6270,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"How great soe'er the splendor / erstwhile beside the Rhine,"
6271,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Here none the less was given / raiment yet more fine,"
6272,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Nor were they e'er attired / in all their days so well.
6273,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Full many a wonder might I / of their rich apparel tell.
6274,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6275,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,712
6276,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6277,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"How there in state resplendent / they sat and had full store,"
6278,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And how each high attendant / gold-broidered raiment wore,"
6279,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,With stones full rare and precious / set with skill therein!
6280,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,The while with care did serve them / Siegelind the noble queen.
6281,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6282,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,713
6283,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6284,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Then spake the royal Siegmund / before his people so:
6285,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"""To every friend of Siegfried / give I now to know"
6286,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"That he before these warriors / my royal crown shall wear."""
6287,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And did rejoice that message / the thanes of Netherland to hear.
6288,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6289,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,714
6290,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6291,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,His crown to him he tendered / and rule o'er wide domain
6292,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Whereof he all was master. / Where'er did reach his reign
6293,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Or men were subject to him / bestowed his hand such care
6294,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,That evil-doers trembled / before the spouse of Kriemhild fair.
6295,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6296,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,715
6297,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6298,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"In such high honor truly / he lived, as ye shall hear,"
6299,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And judged as lofty monarch / unto the tenth year,"
6300,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,What time his fairest lady / to him a son did bear.
6301,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Thereat the monarch's kinsmen / filled with mickle joyance were.
6302,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6303,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,716
6304,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6305,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"They soon the same did christen / and gave to him a name,"
6306,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther, as hight his uncle, / nor cause was that for shame:"
6307,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Grew he but like his kinsmen / then happy might he be.
6308,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"As well he did deserve it, / him fostered they right carefully."
6309,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6310,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,717
6311,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6312,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"In the selfsame season / did Lady Siegelind die,"
6313,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"When was full power wielded / by Ute's daughter high,"
6314,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,As meet so lofty lady / should homage wide receive.
6315,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,That death her thus had taken / did many a worthy kinsman grieve.
6316,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6317,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,718
6318,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6319,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Now by the Rhine yonder, / as we likewise hear,"
6320,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Unto mighty Gunther / eke a son did bear
6321,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Brunhild his fair lady / in the land of Burgundy.
6322,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,In honor to the hero / Siegfried named eke was he.
6323,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6324,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,719
6325,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6326,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,The child they also fostered / with what tender care!
6327,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Gunther the noble monarch / anon did masters rare
6328,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Find who should instruct him / a worthy man to grow.
6329,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Alas! by sad misfortune / to friends was dealt how fell a blow!
6330,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6331,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,720
6332,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6333,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"At all times the story / far abroad was told,"
6334,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,How that in right worthy / way the warriors bold
6335,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Lived there in Siegmund's country / as noble knights should do.
6336,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,Likewise did royal Gunther / eke amid his kinsmen true.
6337,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6338,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,721
6339,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6340,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Land of the Nibelungen / Siegfried as well did own,"
6341,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,--Amid his lofty kindred / a mightier ne'er was known--
6342,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"And Schilbung's knights did serve him, / with all that theirs had been."
6343,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,That great was thus his power / did fill with joy the knight full keen.
6344,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6345,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,722
6346,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6347,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Hoard of all the greatest / that hero ever won,"
6348,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Save who erstwhile did wield it, / now the knight did own,"
6349,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"The which before a mountain / he seized against despite,"
6350,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,And for whose sake he further / slew full many a gallant knight.
6351,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6352,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,723
6353,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,
6354,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Naught more his heart could wish for; / yet had his might been less,"
6355,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Rightly must all people / of the high knight confess,"
6356,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,One was he of the worthiest / that e'er bestrode a steed.
6357,ELEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Feared was his mickle prowess, / and, sooth to say, thereof was need."

6364,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,How Gunther bade Siegfried to the Feast
6365,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,
6366,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,724
6367,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,
6368,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,Now all time bethought her / royal Gunther's wife:
6369,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,"""How now doth Lady Kriemhild / lead so haughty life?"
6370,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,"In sooth her husband Siegfried / doth homage to us owe,"
6371,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,"But now full long unto us / little service he doth show."""
6372,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,
6373,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,725
6374,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,
6375,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,That in her heart in secret / eke she pondered o'er.
6376,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,"That they were strangers to her / did grieve her heart full sore,"
6377,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,And so seldom sign of service / came from Siegfried's land.
6378,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,"How it thus was fallen, / that she fain would understand."
6379,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,
6380,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,726
6381,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,
6382,TWELFTH ADVENTURE,"She probed then the monarch, / if the thing might be,"

6751,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6752,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,778
6753,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6754,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Leave we now the ardor / wherewith they did prepare,"
6755,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,And tell how Lady Kriemhild / and eke her maidens fair
6756,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,From land of Nibelungen / did journey to the Rhine.
6757,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Ne'er did horses carry / such store of raiment rich and fine.
6758,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6759,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,779
6760,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6761,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Carrying-chests full many / for the way they made ready.
6762,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then rode the thane Siegfried / with his friends in company
6763,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,And eke the queen thither / where joy they looked to find.
6764,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Where now was high rejoicing / they soon in sorest grief repined.
6765,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6766,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,780
6767,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6768,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,At home behind them left they / Lady Kriemhild's son
6769,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,That she did bear to Siegfried / --'twas meet that that be done.
6770,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,From this their festive journey / rose mickle sorrow sore:
6771,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,His father and his mother / their child beheld they never more.
6772,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6773,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,781
6774,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6775,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then eke with them thither / Siegmund the king did ride.
6776,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Had he e'er had knowledge / what should there betide
6777,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Anon from that high journey, / such had he never seen:"
6778,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Ne'er wrought upon dear kindred / might so grievous wrong have been.
6779,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6780,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,782
6781,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6782,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Messengers sent they forward / that the tidings told should be.
6783,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then forth did ride to meet them / with gladsome company
6784,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Ute's friends full many / and many a Gunther's man.
6785,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,With zeal to make him ready / unto his guests the king began.
6786,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6787,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,783
6788,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6789,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Where he found Brunhild sitting, / thither straight went he."
6790,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""How received thee my sister, / as thou cam'st to this country?"
6791,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Like preparations shalt thou / for Siegfried's wife now make."""
6792,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Fain do I that; good reason / have I to love her well,"" she spake."
6793,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6794,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,784
6795,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6796,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then quoth the mighty monarch: / ""The morn shall see them here."
6797,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Wilt thou go forth to meet them, / apace do thou prepare,"
6798,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,That not within the castle / their coming we await.
6799,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Guests more welcome never / greeted I of high estate."""
6800,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6801,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,785
6802,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6803,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Her maidens and her ladies / straight did she command
6804,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"To choose them rich apparel, / the best within the land,"
6805,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,In which the stately company / before the guests should go.
6806,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The same they did right gladly, / that may ye full surely know."
6807,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6808,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,786
6809,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6810,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then eke to offer service / the men of Gunther hied,"
6811,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,And all his doughty warriors / saw ye by the monarch's side.
6812,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then rode the queen full stately / the strangers forth to meet,"
6813,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,And hearty was the welcome / as she her loving guests did greet.
6814,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6815,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,787
6816,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6817,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,With what glad rejoicings / the guests they did receive!
6818,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,They deemed that Lady Kriemhild / did unto Brunhild give
6819,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Ne'er so warm a welcome / to the land of Burgundy.
6820,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Bold knights that yet were strangers / rejoiced each other there to see.
6821,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6822,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,788
6823,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6824,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Now come was also Siegfried / with his valiant men.
6825,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The warriors saw ye riding / thither and back again,"
6826,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Where'er the plain extended, / with huge company."
6827,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,From the dust and crowding / could none in all the rout be free.
6828,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6829,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,789
6830,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6831,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,When the monarch of the country / Siegfried did see
6832,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And with him also Siegmund, / spake he full lovingly:"
6833,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Be ye to me full welcome / and to all these friends of mine."

6840,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Since that my son Siegfried / thee for a friend hath known,"
6841,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"My heart hath e'er advised me / that thee I soon should see."""
6842,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereto spake royal Gunther: / ""Joy hast thou brought full great to me."""

6848,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,There joined in way right courteous / Gernot and Giselher:
6849,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,I ween so warm a welcome / did they make for strangers ne'er.
6850,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6851,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,792
6852,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6853,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,The spouse of each high monarch / greeted the other there.
6854,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Emptied was many a saddle, / and many a lady fair"
6855,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,By hero's hand was lifted / adown upon the sward.
6856,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,By waiting on fair lady / how many a knight sought high reward!
6857,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6858,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,793
6859,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6860,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,So went unto each other / the ladies richly dight;
6861,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereat in high rejoicing / was seen full many a knight,"
6862,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,That by both the greeting / in such fair way was done.
6863,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,By fair maidens standing / saw ye warriors many a one.
6864,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6865,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,794
6866,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,

6872,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,795
6873,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6874,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,They bided there no longer / but rode into the town.
6875,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The host bade to the strangers / in fitting way be shown,"
6876,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,That they were seen full gladly / in the land of Burgundy.
6877,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,High knights full many tilting / before fair ladies might ye see.
6878,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6879,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,796

6881,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then did of Tronje Hagen / and eke Ortwein
6882,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,In high feats of valor / all other knights outshine.
6883,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Whate'er the twain commanded / dared none to leave undone;
6884,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,By them was many a service / to their high guests in honor shown.
6885,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6886,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,797
6887,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6888,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Shields heard ye many clashing / before the castle gate
6889,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,With din of lances breaking. / Long in saddle sate
6890,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The host and guests there with him, / ere that within they went."
6891,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,With full merry pastime / joyfully the hours they spent.
6892,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6893,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,798
6894,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6895,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Unto the Hall so spacious / rode the merry company.
6896,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Many a silken cover / wrought full cunningly
6897,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Saw ye beyond the saddles / of the ladies debonair
6898,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,On all sides down hanging. / King Gunther's men did meet them there.
6899,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6900,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,799
6901,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6902,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Led by the same the strangers / to their apartments passed.
6903,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Meanwhile oft her glances / Brunhild was seen to cast
6904,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Upon the Lady Kriemhild, / for she was passing fair."
6905,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,In lustre vied her color / with the gold that she did wear.
6906,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6907,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,800
6908,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6909,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Within the town a clamor / at Worms on every hand
6910,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Arose amid their followers. / King Gunther gave command
6911,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,To Dankwart his Marshal / to tend them all with care.
6912,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then bade he fitting quarters / for the retinue prepare.
6913,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6914,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,801
6915,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6916,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Without and in the castle / the board for all was set:
6917,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,In sooth were never strangers / better tended yet.
6918,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Whatever any wished for / did they straightway provide:
6919,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,So mighty was the monarch / that naught to any was denied.
6920,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6921,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,802
6922,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6923,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,To them was kind attention / and all good friendship shown.
6924,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,The host then at the table / with his guests sat him down.
6925,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried they bade be seated / where he did sit before.
6926,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then went with him to table / full many a stately warrior more.
6927,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6928,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,803
6929,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6930,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Gallant knights twelve hundred / in the circle there, I ween,"
6931,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,With him sat at table. / Brunhild the lofty queen
6932,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Did deem that never vassal / could more mighty be.
6933,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"So well she yet was minded, / she saw it not unwillingly."
6934,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6935,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,804
6936,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6937,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"There upon an evening, / as the king with guests did dine,"
6938,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Full many a rich attire / was wet with ruddy wine,"
6939,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,As passed among the tables / the butlers to and fro.
6940,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,And great was their endeavor / full honor to the guests to show.
6941,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6942,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,805
6943,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6944,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,As long hath been the custom / at high festivity
6945,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Fit lodging there was given / to maid and high lady.
6946,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,From whence soe'er they came there / they had the host's good care;
6947,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Unto each guest was meted / of fitting honors fullest share.
6948,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6949,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,806
6950,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6951,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When now the night was ended / and came forth the dawn,"
6952,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"From chests they carried with them, / full many a precious stone"
6953,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Sparkled on costly raiment / by hand of lady sought.
6954,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Stately robes full many / forth to deck them then they brought.
6955,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6956,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,807
6957,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6958,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Ere dawn was full appeared, / before the Hall again"
6959,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Came knights and squires many, / whereat arose the din"
6960,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,E'en before the matins / that for the king were sung.
6961,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Well pleased was the monarch / at joust to see the warriors young.
6962,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6963,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,808
6964,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6965,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Full lustily and loudly / many a horn did blare,"
6966,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Of flutes and eke of trumpets / such din did rend the air
6967,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,That loud came back the echo / from Worms the city wide.
6968,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,The warriors high-hearted / to saddle sprung on every side.
6969,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6970,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,809
6971,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6972,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Arose there in that country / high a jousting keen
6973,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Of many a doughty warrior / whereof were many seen,"
6974,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Whom there their hearts more youthful / did make of merry mood;
6975,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Of these 'neath shield there saw ye / many a stately knight and good.
6976,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6977,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,810
6978,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6979,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,There sat within the casements / many a high lady
6980,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And maidens many with them, / the which were fair to see."
6981,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Down looked they where did tourney / many a valiant man.
6982,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,The host with his good kinsmen / himself a-riding soon began.
6983,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6984,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,811
6985,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6986,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Thus they found them pastime, / and fled the time full well;"
6987,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then heard they from the minster / the sound of many a bell.
6988,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Forth upon their horses / the ladies thence did ride;
6989,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Many a knight full valiant / the lofty queens accompanied.
6990,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6991,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,812
6992,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6993,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,They then before the minster / alighted on the grass.
6994,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Unto her guests Queen Brunhild / yet well-minded was.
6995,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Into the spacious minster / they passed, and each wore crown."
6996,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Their friendship yet was broken / by direst jealousy anon.
6997,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
6998,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,813
6999,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7000,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,When the mass was ended / went they thence again
7001,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,In full stately manner. / Thereafter were they seen
7002,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Joyous at board together. / The pleasure full did last,"
7003,THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE,Until days eleven / amid the merry-making passed.

7011,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7012,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,814
7013,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7014,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,Before the time of vespers / arose a mickle stir
7015,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,On part of warriors many / upon the courtyard there.
7016,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,In knightly fashion made they / the time go pleasantly;
7017,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,Thither knights and ladies / went their merry play to see.
7018,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7019,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,815
7020,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7021,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"There did sit together / the queens, a stately pair,"
7022,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And of two knights bethought them, / that noble warriors were."
7023,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the fair Kriemhild: / ""Such spouse in sooth have I,"
7024,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"That all these mighty kingdoms / might well beneath his sceptre lie."""
7025,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7026,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,816
7027,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7028,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the Lady Brunhild: / ""How might such thing be?"
7029,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"If that there lived none other / but himself and thee,"
7030,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,So might perchance his power / rule these kingdoms o'er;
7031,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The while that liveth Gunther, / may such thing be nevermore."""
7032,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7033,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,817
7034,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7035,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then again spake Kriemhild: / ""Behold how he doth stand"

7038,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"In sooth to think upon it / a joyous mood to me is given."""
7039,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7040,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,818

7046,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7047,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,819
7048,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7049,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then again spake Kriemhild: / ""So worthy is my spouse,"

7053,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7054,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,820

7056,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now guard thee, Lady Kriemhild, / my word amiss to take,"

7060,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7061,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,821

7836,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,At every point the runways. / The company then did greet
7837,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Siegfried the keen and doughty: / ""Who now within the green"
7838,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto the game shall guide us, / ye warriors so bold and keen?"""
7839,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7840,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,930
7841,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7842,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now part we from each other,"" / answered Hagen then,"
7843,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Ere that the hunting / we do here begin!"
7844,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Thereby may be apparent / to my masters and to me
7845,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Who on this forest journey / of the hunters best may be.
7846,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7847,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,931
7848,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7849,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Let then hounds and huntsmen / be ta'en in equal share,"
7850,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"That wheresoever any / would go, there let him fare."
7851,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Who then is first in hunting / shall have our thanks this day."""
7852,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Not longer there together / did the merry hunters stay.
7853,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7854,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,932
7855,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7856,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereto quoth Sir Siegfried: / ""Of dogs have I no need,"
7857,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,More than one hound only / of trusty hunting breed
7858,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,For scenting well the runway / of wild beast through the brake.
7859,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And now the chase begin we!"" / --so the spouse of Kriemhild spake."
7860,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7861,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,933
7862,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7863,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then took a practised hunter / a good tracking-hound,"
7864,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"That did bring them where they / game in plenty found,"
7865,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Nor kept them long awaiting. / Whate'er did spring from lair
7866,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Pursued the merry huntsmen, / as still good hunters everywhere."
7867,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7868,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,934
7869,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7870,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,As many as the hound started / slew with mighty hand
7871,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried the full doughty / hero of Netherland.
7872,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,So swiftly went his charger / that none could him outrun;
7873,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And praise before all others / soon he in the hunting won.
7874,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7875,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,935
7876,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7877,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,He was in every feature / a valiant knight and true.
7878,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,The first within the forest / that with his hand he slew
7879,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Was a half-grown wild-boar / that he smote to ground;
7880,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Thereafter he full quickly / a wild and mighty lion found.
7881,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7882,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,936
7883,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7884,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When it the hound had started, / with bow he shot it dead,"
7885,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Wherewith a pointed arrow / he had so swiftly sped
7886,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,That the lion after / could forward spring but thrice.
7887,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,All they that hunted with him / cried Siegfried's praise with merry
7888,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,voice.
7889,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7890,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,937
7891,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7892,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Soon fell a prey unto him / an elk and bison more,"
7893,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,A giant stag he slew him / and huge ure-oxen four.
7894,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,His steed bore him so swiftly / that none could him outrun;
7895,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Of stag or hind encountered / scarce could there escape him one.
7896,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7897,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,938
7898,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7899,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"A boar full huge and bristling / soon was likewise found,"
7900,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And when the same bethought him / to flee before the hound,"
7901,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Came quick again the master / and stood athwart his path.
7902,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,The boar upon the hero / full charged straightway in mickle wrath.
7903,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7904,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,939
7905,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7906,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then the spouse of Kriemhild, / with sword the boar he slew,"
7907,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,A thing that scarce another / hunter had dared to do.
7908,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When he thus had felled him / they lashed again the hound,"
7909,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And soon his hunting prowess / was known to all the people round.
7910,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7911,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,940
7912,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7913,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake to him his huntsmen: / ""If that the thing may be,"
7914,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"So let some part, Sir Siegfried, / of the forest game go free;"
7915,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"To-day thou makest empty / hillside and forest wild."""
7916,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Thereat in merry humor / the thane so keen and valiant smiled.
7917,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7918,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,941
7919,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7920,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then they heard on all sides / the din, from many a hound"
7921,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And huntsmen eke the clamor / so great was heard around
7922,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,That back did come the answer / from hill and forest tree--
7923,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Of hounds had four-and-twenty / packs been set by hunter free.
7924,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7925,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,942
7926,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7927,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Full many a forest denizen / from life was doomed to part.
7928,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Each of all the hunters / thereon had set his heart,"
7929,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"To win the prize in hunting. / But such could never be,"
7930,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,When they the doughty Siegfried / at the camping-place did see.
7931,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7932,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,943
7933,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7934,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Now the chase was ended, / --and yet complete 'twas not."
7935,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,All they to camp who wended / with them thither brought
7936,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Skin of full many an animal / and of game good store.
7937,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Heigho! unto the table / how much the king's attendants bore!
7938,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7939,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,944
7940,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7941,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then bade the king the noble / hunters all to warn
7942,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"That he would take refreshment, / and loud a hunting-horn"
7943,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,In one long blast was winded: / to all was known thereby
7944,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,That the noble monarch / at camp did wait their company.
7945,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7946,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,945
7947,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7948,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake one of Siegfried's huntsmen: / ""Master, I do know"
7949,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,By blast of horn resounding / that we now shall go
7950,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Unto the place of meeting; / thereto I'll make reply."""
7951,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then for the merry hunters / blew the horn right lustily.
7952,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7953,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,946
7954,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7955,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake Sir Siegfried: / ""Now leave we eke the green."""
7956,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"His charger bore him smoothly, / and followed huntsmen keen."
7957,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"With their rout they started / a beast of savage kind,"
7958,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,That was a bear untamed. / Then spake the knight to those behind
7959,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7960,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,947
7961,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7962,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""For our merry party / some sport will I devise."
7963,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Let slip the hound then straightway, / a bear now meets my eyes,"
7964,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And with us shall he thither / unto the camp-fire fare.
7965,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Full rapid must his flight be / shall he our company forbear."""
7966,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7967,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,948
7968,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7969,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"From leash the hound was loosened, / the bear sprang through the brake,"
7970,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,When that the spouse of Kriemhild / did wish him to o'ertake.
7971,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"He sought a pathless thicket, / but yet it could not be,"
7972,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"As bruin fondly hoped it, / that from the hunter he was free."
7973,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7974,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,949
7975,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7976,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then from his horse alighted / the knight of spirit high,"
7977,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And gan a running after. / Bruin all unguardedly
7978,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Was ta'en, and could escape not. / Him caught straightway the knight,"
7979,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And soon all unwounded / had him bound in fetters tight.
7980,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7981,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,950
7982,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7983,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Nor claws nor teeth availed him / for aught of injury,"
7984,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,But bound he was to saddle. / Then mounted speedily
7985,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The knight, and to the camp-fire / in right merry way"
7986,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"For pastime led he bruin, / the hero valiant and gay."
7987,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7988,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,951
7989,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7990,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,In what manner stately / unto the camp he rode!
7991,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"He bore a spear full mickle, / great of strength and broad."
7992,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"A sword all ornamented / hung down unto his spur,"
7993,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And wrought of gold all ruddy / at side a glittering horn he wore.
7994,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7995,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,952
7996,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
7997,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Of richer hunting-garments / heard I ne'er tell before.
7998,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Black was the silken tunic / that the rider wore,"
7999,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And cap of costly sable / did crown the gallant knight.
8000,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Heigho, and how his quiver / with well-wrought hands was rich bedight!"
8001,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8002,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,953
8003,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8004,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"A skin of gleaming panther / covered the quiver o'er,"
8005,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Prized for its pleasant odor. / Eke a bow he bore,"
8006,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The which to draw if ever / had wished another man,"
8007,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,A lever he had needed: / such power had Siegfried alone.
8008,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8009,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,954
8010,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8011,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Of fur of costly otter / his mantle was complete,"
8012,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,With other skins embroidered / from head unto the feet.
8013,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And 'mid the fur all shining, / full many a golden seam"
8014,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,On both sides of the valiant / huntsman saw ye brightly gleam.
8015,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8016,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,955
8017,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8018,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Balmung, a goodly weapon / broad, he also wore,"
8019,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,That was so sharp at edges / that it ne'er forbore
8020,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,To cleave when swung on helmet: / blade it was full good.
8021,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Stately was the huntsman / as there with merry heart he rode.
8022,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8023,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,956
8024,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8025,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"If that complete the story / to you I shall unfold,"
8026,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Full many a goodly arrow / did his rich quiver hold
8027,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Whereof were gold the sockets, / and heads a hand-breadth each."
8028,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,In sooth was doomed to perish / whate'er in flight the same did reach.
8029,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8030,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,957
8031,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8032,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Pricking like goodly huntsman / the noble knight did ride
8033,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,When him the men of Gunther / coming thither spied.
8034,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"They hasted out to meet him / and took from him his steed,"
8035,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,As bruin great and mighty / by the saddle he did lead.
8036,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8037,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,958
8038,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8039,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,When he from horse alighted / he loosed him every band
8040,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,From foot and eke from muzzle. / Straight on every hand
8041,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Began the dogs a howling / when they beheld the bear.
8042,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Bruin would to the forest: / among the men was mickle stir.
8043,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8044,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,959
8045,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8046,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Amid the clamor bruin / through the camp-fires sped:
8047,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Heigho, how the servants / away before him fled!"
8048,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,O'erturned was many a kettle / and flaming brands did fly:
8049,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Heigho, what goodly victuals / did scattered in the ashes lie!"
8050,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8051,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,960
8052,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8053,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then sprang from out the saddle / knights and serving-men.
8054,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,The bear was wild careering: / the king bade loosen then
8055,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,All the dogs that fastened / within their leashes lay.
8056,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"If this thing well had ended, / then had there passed a merry day."
8057,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8058,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,961
8059,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8060,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Not longer then they waited / but with bow and eke with spear
8061,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Hasted the nimble hunters / to pursue the bear,"
8062,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Yet none might shoot upon him / for all the dogs around.
8063,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Such clamor was of voices / that all the mountain did resound.
8064,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8065,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,962
8066,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8067,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When by the dogs pursued / the bear away did run,"
8068,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,None there that could o'ertake him / but Siegfried alone.
8069,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"With his sword he came upon him / and killed him at a blow,"
8070,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And back unto the camp-fire / bearing bruin they did go.
8071,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8072,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,963
8073,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8074,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake who there had seen it, / he was a man of might."
8075,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Soon to the table bade they / come each noble knight,"
8076,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And on a smiling meadow / the noble company sat.
8077,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Heigho, with what rare victuals / did they upon the huntsmen wait!"
8078,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8079,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,964
8080,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8081,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Ne'er appeared a butler / wine for them to pour.
8082,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Than they good knights were never / better served before,"
8083,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And had there not in secret / been lurking treachery,"
8084,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then were the entertainers / from every cause of cavil free.
8085,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8086,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,965
8087,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8088,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake Sir Siegfried: / ""A wonder 'tis to me,"
8089,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Since that from the kitchen / so full supplied are we,"
8090,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Why to us the butlers / of wine bring not like store:
8091,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,If such the huntsman's service / a huntsman reckon me no more.
8092,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8093,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,966
8094,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8095,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Meseems I yet did merit / some share of courtesy."""
8096,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,The king who sat at table / spake then in treachery:
8097,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Gladly shall be amended / wherein we're guilty so."
8098,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The fault it is of Hagen, / he'd willing see us thirsting go."""
8099,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8100,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,967
8101,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8102,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / ""Good master, hear me say,"
8103,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,I weened for this our hunting / we did go to-day
8104,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Unto the Spessart forest: / the wine I thither sent.
8105,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Go we to-day a-thirsting, / I'll later be more provident."""
8106,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8107,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,968
8108,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8109,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereto replied Sir Siegfried: / ""Small merit here is thine."
8110,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Good seven horses laden / with mead and sparkling wine
8111,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Should hither have been conducted. / If aught the same denied,"
8112,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then should our place of meeting / have nearer been the Rhine beside."""
8113,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8114,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,969
8115,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8116,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / ""Ye noble knights and bold,"
8117,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,I know here nigh unto us / a spring that's flowing cold.
8118,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Be then your wrath appeased, / and let us thither go."""
8119,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Through that same wicked counsel / came many a thane to grievous woe.
8120,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8121,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,970
8122,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8123,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Sore was the noble Siegfried / with the pangs of thirst:
8124,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,To bid them rise from table / was he thus the first.
8125,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,He would along the hillside / unto the fountain go:
8126,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"In sooth they showed them traitors, / those knights who there did"
8127,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,counsel so.
8128,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8129,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,971
8130,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8131,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,On wagons hence to carry / the game they gave command
8132,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Which had that day been slaughtered / by Siegfried's doughty hand.
8133,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"He'd carried off the honors, / all who had seen did say."
8134,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Hagen his faith with Siegfried / soon did break in grievous way.
8135,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8136,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,972
8137,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8138,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When now they would go thither / to where the linden spread,"
8139,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Spake of Tronje Hagen: / ""To me hath oft been said,"
8140,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,That none could follow after / Kriemhild's nimble knight
8141,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Or vie with him in running: / would that he'd prove it to our sight!"""
8142,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8143,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,973
8144,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8145,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then spake of Netherland / bold Siegfried speedily:
8146,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""That may ye well have proof of, / will ye but run with me"
8147,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"In contest to the fountain. / When that the same be done,"
8148,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"To him be given honor / who the race hath fairly won."""
8149,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8150,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,974
8151,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8152,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""Now surely make we trial,"" / quoth Hagen the thane."
8153,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Thereto the doughty Siegfried: / ""I too will give you gain,"
8154,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Afore your feet at starting / to lay me in the grass."""
8155,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When that he had heard it, / thereat how joyous Gunther was!"
8156,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8157,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,975
8158,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8159,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"And spake again the warrior: / ""And ye shall further hear:"
8160,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"All my clothing likewise / will I upon me wear,"
8161,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The spear and shield full heavy / and hunting-dress I'll don."""
8162,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,His sword as well as quiver / had he full quickly girded on.
8163,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8164,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,976
8165,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8166,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Doffed they their apparel / and aside they laid it then:
8167,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Clothed in white shirts only / saw you there the twain.
8168,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Like unto two wild panthers / they coursed across the green:
8169,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Yet first beside the fountain / was the valiant Siegfried seen.
8170,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8171,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,977
8172,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8173,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,No man in feats of valor / who with him had vied.
8174,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"The sword he soon ungirded / and quiver laid aside,"
8175,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,The mighty spear he leaned / against the linden-tree:
8176,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Beside the running fountain / stood the knight stately to see.
8177,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8178,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,978
8179,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8180,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,To Siegfried naught was lacking / that doth good knight adorn.
8181,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Down the shield then laid he / where did flow the burn,"
8182,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Yet howsoe'er he thirsted / no whit the hero drank
8183,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Before had drunk the monarch: / therefor he earned but evil thank.
8184,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8185,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,979
8186,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8187,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"There where ran clear the water / and cool from out the spring,"
8188,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Down to it did bend him / Gunther the king.
8189,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And when his thirst was quenched / rose he from thence again:
8190,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Eke the valiant Siegfried, / how glad had he done likewise then."
8191,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8192,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,980
8193,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8194,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"For his courtesy he suffered. / Where bow and sword there lay,"
8195,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Both did carry Hagen / from him thence away,"
8196,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And again sprang quickly thither / where the spear did stand:
8197,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,And for a cross the tunic / of the valiant knight he scanned.
8198,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8199,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,981

8214,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,

8217,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,The prince weened to find there / his bow or his sword:
8218,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then in sooth had Hagen / found the traitor's meet reward.
8219,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8220,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,984
8221,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8222,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"When from the sorely wounded / knight his sword was gone,"
8223,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Then had he naught to 'venge him / but his shield alone.
8224,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"This snatched he from the fountain / and Hagen rushed upon,"

8232,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Thus vengeance fain had taken / upon his foe the stately thane.
8233,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8234,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,986
8235,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8236,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Beneath his hand must Hagen / stagger and fall to ground.

8246,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,Full many a fairest lady / for the knight anon must weep.
8247,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,

8558,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,She gave them kindly warning / as friend to friend beloved doth.
8559,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8560,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,1031
8561,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8562,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Then spake she rich in sorrow: / ""What thing beginnest thou,"

8656,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,Thereby the guilt of Hagen / might they now full plainly tell.
8657,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,
8658,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,1045

9612,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Every eye did gaze on / the knights that came in state,"
9613,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And mickle was the wonder / whence to the Rhine they came.
9614,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then sent the king for Hagen, / if he perchance might know the same."
9615,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9616,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1178
9617,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9618,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then spake he of Tronje: / ""These knights I ne'er have seen,"

9625,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,For the guests fit lodgings / now provided were.
9626,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Clad in rich apparel / came the messenger,"

9628,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Sumptuous attire / wore they, wrought full cunningly."
9629,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9630,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1180
9631,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9632,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the doughty Hagen: / ""As far as goes my ken,"

9641,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Scarce had King Gunther / his mind full spoken there,"

9643,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9644,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1182
9645,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9646,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,He and his friends then hastened / with warmest welcoming.
9647,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then saw ye knights five hundred / adown from saddle spring,"

9656,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Thereat was fitting honor / done to every valiant Hun.
9657,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9658,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1184
9659,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9660,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,The monarch's nearest kinsmen / went forth the guests to meet.
9661,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Of Metz the knight Sir Ortwein / Ruediger thus did greet:
9662,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""The while our life hath lasted, / never yet hath guest"
9663,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Here been seen so gladly: / be that in very truth confessed."""
9664,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9665,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1185
9666,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9667,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,For that greeting thanked they / the brave knights one and all.
9668,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"With train of high attendants / they passed unto the hall,"

9670,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,The king arose from settle / in courteous way the guests to greet.
9671,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9672,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1186
9673,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9674,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Right courteously he greeted / then the messenger.
9675,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Gunther and Gernot, / full busy both they were"
9676,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,For stranger and companions / a welcome fit to make.
9677,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,The noble knight Sir Ruediger / by the hand the king did take.
9678,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9679,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1187
9680,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9681,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,He led him to the settle / where himself he sat:
9682,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,He bade pour for the strangers / (a welcome work was that)
9683,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Mead the very choicest / and the best of wine,"

9685,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9686,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1188
9687,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9688,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Giselher and Gere / joined the company too,"

9690,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"The coming of the strangers: / glad they were of mood,"
9691,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And greeted 'fore the monarch / fair the noble knights and good.
9692,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9693,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1189
9694,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9695,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Then spake unto his master / of Tronje the knight:
9696,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""Let our thanes seek ever / fully to requite"

9704,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Etzel and Helke / afar in Hunland."""
9705,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then answered him the margrave: / ""Fain would I have thee understand."""
9706,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9707,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1191
9708,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9709,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Then rose he from the settle / and his men every one.

9720,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9721,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1193
9722,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9723,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the upright messenger: / ""Hither to thee at Rhine"

9769,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9770,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1200

9783,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9784,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1202
9785,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,

9792,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9793,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Together all save Hagen / did the thing advise,"
9794,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And unto King Gunther / spake he in this wise:

9803,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Yea, ought ourselves to seek it, / might it but her honor be."""
9804,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9805,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1205
9806,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9807,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Thereto gave answer Hagen: / ""Now such words give o'er."

9817,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Thereto gave answer Hagen: / ""Such counsel hast thou ne'er of me."""
9818,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9819,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1207
9820,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9821,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then did they bid for Gernot / and Giselher to go,"
9822,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"For wished they of the royal / twain their mind to know,"
9823,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,If that the mighty monarch / Kriemhild for spouse should take.

9825,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9826,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1208
9827,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9828,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Then spake of Burgundy / Giselher the thane:
9829,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""Well may'st thou now, friend Hagen, / show upright mind again:"
9830,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,For sorrows wrought upon her / may'st thou her well requite.

9845,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then in sooth will serve her / full many a keen and doughty man."""
9846,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9847,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1211
9848,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9849,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,In answer then to Hagen / the brave Gernot said:
9850,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""With us doth lie to leave it / until they both be dead,"

9861,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9862,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1213
9863,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9864,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,In anger spake then Giselher / the son of Ute the fair:
9865,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""None shall yet among us / himself like traitor bear."
9866,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"What honor e'er befall her, / rejoice thereat should we."
9867,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Whate'er thou sayest, Hagen, / true helper shall she find in me."""
9868,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9869,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1214
9870,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9871,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,When that heard it Hagen / straightway waxed he wroth.
9872,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Gernot and Giselher / the knights high-minded both,"
9873,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"And Gunther, mighty monarch, / did counsel finally,"
9874,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"If that did wish it Kriemhild, / by them 'twould unopposed be."
9875,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9876,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1215
9877,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9878,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the margrave Gere: / ""That lady will I tell"

9882,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
9883,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1216

10314,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And soon of Kriemhild's treasure / they from the chamber bore
10315,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Marks full thirty thousand / or e'en more plenteously.
10316,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"He bade the guests to take it, / which pleased King Gunther well to see."
10317,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10318,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1278
10319,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10320,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Then Gotelinde's husband / of Bechelaren spake:
10321,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""An if my Lady Kriemhild / with her complete might take"
10322,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"What treasure e'er came hither / from Nibelungenland,"
10323,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Ne'er a whit would touch it / mine or my royal lady's hand.
10324,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10325,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1279
10326,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10327,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""Now bid them here to keep it, / for ne'er the same I'll touch."
10328,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Yea brought I from my country / of mine own wealth so much,"
10329,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"That we upon our journey / may be full well supplied,"
10330,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"And ne'er have lack in outlay / as in state we homeward ride."""
10331,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10332,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1280
10333,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10334,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Chests well filled a dozen / from the time of old
10335,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Had for their own her maidens, / of the best of gold"
10336,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"That e'er ye might discover: / now thence away 'twas borne,"
10337,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And jewels for the ladies / upon the journey to be worn.
10338,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10339,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1281
10340,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10341,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Of the might she yet was fearful / of Hagen grim and bold.
10342,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Still had she of mass-money / a thousand marks in gold,"
10343,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,That gave she for the soul's rest / of her husband dear.
10344,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Such loving deed and faithful / did touch the heart of Ruediger.
10345,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10346,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1282
10347,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10348,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then spake the lady mournful: / ""Who now that loveth me,"
10349,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"And for the love they bear me / may willing exiles be,"
10350,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Who with me to Hunland / now away shall ride?
10351,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Take they of my treasure / and steeds and meet attire provide."""
10352,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10353,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1283
10354,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10355,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Then did the margrave Eckewart / answer thus the queen:
10356,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""Since I from the beginning / of thy train have been,"
10357,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Have I e'er right faithful / served thee,"" spake the thane,"
10358,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""And to the end I'll ever / thus faithful unto thee remain."
10359,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10360,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1284
10361,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10362,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"""Eke will I lead with me / five hundred of my men,"
10363,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Whom I grant to serve thee / in faithful way again.
10364,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Nor e'er shall we be parted / till that we be dead."""
10365,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Low bowing thanked him Kriemhild, / as verily might be his meed."
10366,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10367,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1285
10368,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10369,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Forth were brought the horses, / for that they thence would fare."
10370,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Then was a mickle weeping / of friends that parted there.
10371,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Ute, queen full stately, / and many a lady more"
10372,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Showed that from Lady Kriemhild / to part did grieve their hearts full
10373,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,sore.
10374,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10375,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1286
10376,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10377,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"A hundred stately maidens / with her she led away,"
10378,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"And as for them was fitting, / full rich was their array."
10379,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Many a bitter tear-drop / from shining eye fell down:
10380,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Yet joys knew they full many / eke in Etzel's land anon.
10381,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10382,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1287
10383,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10384,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Thither came Sir Giselher / and Gernot as well,"
10385,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"And with them train of followers, / as duty did compel."
10386,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Safe escort would they furnish / for their dear sister then,"
10387,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And with them led of warriors / a thousand brave and stately men.
10388,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10389,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1288
10390,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10391,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Then came the valiant Gere, / and Ortwein eke came he:"
10392,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Rumold the High Steward / might not absent be.
10393,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Unto the Danube did they / night-quarters meet provide.
10394,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Short way beyond the city / did the royal Gunther ride.
10395,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10396,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,1289
10397,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10398,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Ere from the Rhine they started / had they forward sent
10399,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"Messengers that full quickly / unto Hunland went,"
10400,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,And told unto the monarch / how that Ruediger
10401,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,For spouse at length had won him / the high-born queen beyond compare.
10402,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
10403,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,

10410,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1290
10411,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10412,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,The messengers leave we riding. / Now shall ye understand
10413,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"How did the Lady Kriemhild / journey through the land,"
10414,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,And where from her were parted / Gernot and Giselher.
10415,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Upon her had they waited / as faithful unto her they were.
10416,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10417,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1291
10418,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10419,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"As far as to the Danube / at Vergen did they ride,"
10420,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Where must be the parting / from their royal sister's side,"
10421,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,For that again they homeward / would ride unto the Rhine.
10422,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,No eye but wet from weeping / in all the company was seen.
10423,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10424,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1292
10425,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10426,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Giselher the valiant / thus to his sister said:
10427,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"""If that thou ever, lady, / need hast of my aid,"
10428,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"And fronts thee aught of trouble, / give me to understand,"
10429,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"And straight I'll ride to serve thee / afar unto King Etzel's land."""

10431,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1293
10432,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10433,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Upon the mouth then kissed she / all her friends full dear.
10434,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,The escort soon had taken / eke leave of Ruediger
10435,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,And the margrave's warriors / in manner lovingly.
10436,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,With the queen upon her journey / went many a maid full fair to see.
10437,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10438,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1294
10439,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10440,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Four beyond a hundred / there were, all richly clad"
10441,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,In silk of cunning pattern. / Many a shield full broad
10442,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,On the way did guard the ladies / in hand of valiant thane.
10443,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Full many a stately warrior / from thence did backward turn again.
10444,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10445,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1295
10446,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10447,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Thence away they hastened / down through Bavarian land.
10448,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Soon were told the tidings / how that was at hand
10449,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"A mickle host of strangers, / where a cloister stands from yore"

10457,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,And there the Bishop Pilgrim / the Lady Kriemhild fair did greet.
10458,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10459,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1297
10460,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10461,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,The warriors of that country / no whit grieved they were

10463,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Upon those high-born ladies / their eyes with joy did rest,"
10464,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Full comfortable quarters / prepared they for each noble guest.

10474,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10475,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,There to have them tarry / was the bishop fain.
10476,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"To him spake Sir Eckewart: / ""Here may we not remain."

10653,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"That wore not rich attire / from her, and many a precious stone."
10654,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10655,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1325
10656,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10657,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"When they their fast had broken / and would thence depart,"
10658,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,The lady of the castle / did pledge with faithful heart
10659,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Unto the wife of Etzel / service true to bear.
10660,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Kriemhild caressed full fondly / the margravine's young daughter fair.
10661,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10662,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1326
10663,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10664,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"To the queen then spake the maiden: / ""If e'er it pleaseth thee,"
10665,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Well know I that my father / dear full willingly
10666,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Unto thee will send me / where thou livest in Hunland."""
10667,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"That faithful was the maiden, / full well did Kriemhild understand."
10668,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10669,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1327
10670,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10671,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Now ready were the horses / the castle steps before,"
10672,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,And soon the queen full stately / did take her leave once more
10673,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Of the lovely daughter / and spouse of Ruediger.
10674,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Eke parted with fair greeting / thence full many a maiden fair.
10675,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10676,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1328
10677,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10678,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Each other they full seldom / thereafter might behold.
10679,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,From Medelick were carried / beakers rich of gold
10680,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"In hand and eke full many, / wherein was sparkling wine:"
10681,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Upon the way were greeted / thus the strangers from the Rhine.
10682,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10683,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1329
10684,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10685,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"High there a lord was seated, / Astold the name he bore,"
10686,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Who that into Osterland / did lead the way before
10687,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,As far as to Mautaren / adown the Danube's side.
10688,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,There did they fitting service / for the lofty queen provide.
10689,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10690,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1330
10691,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10692,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Of his niece the bishop / took leave in loving wise.
10693,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"That she well should bear her, / did he oft advise,"
10694,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,And that she win her honor / as Helke erst had done.
10695,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Ah, how great the honor / anon that 'mid the Huns she won!"
10696,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10697,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1331
10698,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10699,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Unto the Traisem brought they / forth the strangers then.
10700,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Fair had they attendance / from Ruediger's men,"
10701,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Till o'er the country riding / the Huns came them to meet.
10702,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,With mickle honor did they / then the royal lady greet.
10703,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10704,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1332
10705,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10706,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"For had the king of Hunland, / Traisem's stream beside,"
10707,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"A full mighty castle, / known afar and wide,"
10708,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,The same hight Traisenmauer: / Dame Helke there before
10709,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Did sit, such bounteous mistress / as scarce ye ever might see more,"
10710,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10711,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1333
10712,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10713,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"An it were not Kriemhild / who could such bounty show,"
10714,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"That after days of sorrow / the pleasure she might know,"
10715,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,To be held in honor / by Etzel's men each one:
10716,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,That praise in fullest measure / had she amid those thanes anon.
10717,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10718,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1334
10719,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10720,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Afar the might of Etzel / so well was known around,"
10721,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,That at every season / within his court were found
10722,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Knights of all the bravest, / whereof ye e'er did hear"
10723,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,In Christian lands or heathen: / with him all thither come they were.
10724,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10725,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,1335
10726,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10727,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"By him at every season, / as scarce might elsewhere be,"
10728,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Knights both of Christian doctrine / and heathen use saw ye.
10729,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Yet in what mind soever / did each and every stand,"
10730,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,To all in fullest measure / dealt the king with bounteous hand.
10731,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10732,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10733,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10734,TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
10735,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE
10736,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10737,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,How Etzel kept the Wedding-feast with Kriemhild
10738,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10739,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1336
10740,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10741,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,At Traisenmauer she tarried / until the fourth day.
10742,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Upon the road the dust-clouds / meanwhile never lay.
10743,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,But rose like smoke of fire / around on every side:
10744,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Onward then through Austria / King Etzel's warriors did ride.
10745,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10746,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1337
10747,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10748,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Then eke unto the monarch / such tidings now were told,"
10749,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"That at the thought did vanish / all his grief of old,"
10750,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,In what high manner Kriemhild / should in his land appear.
10751,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Then gan the monarch hasten / where he did find the lady fair.
10752,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10753,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1338
10754,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10755,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Of many a tongue and varied / upon the way were seen
10756,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Before King Etzel riding / full many warriors keen,"
10757,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Of Christians and of heathen / a spreading company.
10758,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,To greet their coming mistress / forth they rode in fair array.
10759,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10760,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1339
10761,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10762,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Of Reuss men and Greeks there / great was the tale,"
10763,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,And rapid saw ye riding / the Wallach and the Pole
10764,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,On chargers full of mettle / that they did deftly guide.
10765,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Their own country's custom / did they in no wise lay aside.
10766,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10767,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1340
10768,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10769,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"From the land of Kief / rode there full many a thane,"
10770,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"And the wild Petschenegers. / Full many a bow was drawn,"
10771,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,As at the flying wild-fowl / through air the bolt was sped.
10772,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,With might the bow was bended / as far as to the arrow's head.
10773,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10774,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1341
10775,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10776,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"A city by the Danube / in Osterland doth stand,"
10777,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Hight the same is Tulna: / of many a distant land
10778,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Saw Kriemhild there the customs, / ne'er yet to her were known."
10779,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,To many there did greet her / sorrow befell through her anon.
10780,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10781,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1342
10782,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10783,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Before the monarch Etzel / rode a company
10784,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Of merry men and mighty, / courteous and fair to see,"
10785,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Good four-and-twenty chieftains, / mighty men and bold."
10786,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Naught else was their desire / save but their mistress to behold.
10787,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10788,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1343
10789,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10790,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Then the Duke Ramung / from far Wallachia
10791,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,With seven hundred warriors / dashed forth athwart her way:
10792,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Their going might ye liken / unto birds in flight.
10793,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Then came the chieftain Gibeke, / with his host a stately sight."
10794,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10795,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1344
10796,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10797,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Eke the valiant Hornbog / with full thousand men
10798,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,From the king went forward / to greet his mistress then.
10799,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,After their country's custom / in joy they shouted loud;
10800,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The doughty thanes of Hunland / likewise in merry tourney rode.
10801,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10802,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1345
10803,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10804,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Then came a chief from Denmark, / Hawart bold and keen,"
10805,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"And the valiant Iring, / in whom no guile was seen,"
10806,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"And Irnfried of Thuringia, / a stately knight to see:"
10807,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Kriemhild they greeted / that honor high therefrom had she,"
10808,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10809,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1346
10810,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10811,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,With good knights twelve hundred / whom led they in their train.
10812,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Thither with three thousand / came Bloedel eke, the thane"
10813,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That was King Etzel's brother / out of Hunland:
10814,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Unto his royal mistress / led he then his stately band.
10815,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10816,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1347
10817,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10818,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Then did come King Etzel / and Dietrich by his side
10819,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,With all his doughty fellows. / In state there saw ye ride
10820,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Many a knight full noble, / valiant and void of fear."
10821,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The heart of Lady Kriemhild / did such host of warriors cheer.
10822,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10823,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1348
10824,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10825,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Then to his royal mistress / spake Sir Ruediger:
10826,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"""Lady, now give I greeting / to the high monarch here."
10827,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Whom to kiss I bid thee, / grant him such favor then:"
10828,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"For not to all like greeting / may'st thou give 'mid Etzel's men."""
10829,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10830,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1349
10831,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10832,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,They lifted then from saddle / the dame of royal state.
10833,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Etzel the mighty monarch / might then no longer wait,"
10834,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,But sprang from off his charger / with many a warrior keen:
10835,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Unto Kriemhild hasting / full joyously he then was seen.
10836,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10837,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1350
10838,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10839,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"As is to us related, / did there high princes twain"
10840,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"By the lady walking / bear aloft her train,"
10841,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"As the royal Etzel / went forward her to meet,"
10842,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,And she the noble monarch / with kiss in kindly wise did greet.
10843,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10844,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1351
10845,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10846,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Aside she moved her wimple, / whereat her visage fair"
10847,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Gleamed 'mid the gold around it. / Though many a knight stood there,"
10848,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,They deemed that Lady Helke / did boast not fairer face.
10849,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Full close beside the monarch / his brother Bloedel had his place.
10850,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10851,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1352
10852,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10853,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"To kiss him then Margrave / Ruediger her did tell,"
10854,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,And eke the royal Gibeke / and Sir Dietrich as well.
10855,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Of highest knights a dozen / did Etzel's spouse embrace;
10856,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Other knights full many / she greeted with a lesser grace.
10857,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10858,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1353
10859,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10860,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"All the while that Etzel / stood by Kriemhild so,"
10861,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Did the youthful riders / as still they're wont to do:
10862,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"In varied tourney saw ye / each 'gainst the other pass,"
10863,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Christian knights and heathen, / as for each the custom was."
10864,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10865,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1354
10866,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10867,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,From men that followed Dietrich / saw ye in kindly wise
10868,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Splinters from the lances / flying high arise
10869,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Aloft above their bucklers, / from hand of good knight sent!"
10870,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,By the German strangers / pierced was many a shield and rent.
10871,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10872,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1355
10873,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10874,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,From shaft of lances breaking / did far the din resound.
10875,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Together came the warriors / from all the land around,"
10876,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Eke the guests of the monarch / and many a knight there was.
10877,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Thence did the mighty monarch / then with Lady Kriemhild pass.
10878,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10879,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1356
10880,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10881,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Stretched a fair pavilion / beside them there was seen:
10882,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"With tents as well was covered / all around the green,"
10883,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Where they now might rest them / all that weary were.
10884,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,By high-born knights was thither / led full many a lady fair.
10885,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10886,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1357
10887,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10888,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"With their royal mistress, / where in rich cushioned chair"
10889,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Sat the queen full stately. / 'Twas by the margrave's care
10890,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"That well had been provided, / with all that seemed good,"
10891,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,A worthy seat for Kriemhild: / thereat was Etzel glad of mood.
10892,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10893,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1358
10894,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10895,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"What was by Etzel spoken, / may I not understand."
10896,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,In his right hand resting / lay her fair white hand.
10897,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"They sat in loving fashion, / nor Ruediger would let"
10898,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The king have secret converse / with Lady Kriemhild as yet.
10899,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10900,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1359
10901,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10902,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,'Twas bidden that the jousting / on all sides they give o'er.
10903,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The din of stately tourney / heard ye then no more.
10904,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"All the men of Etzel / unto their tents did go,"
10905,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,For every warrior present / did they full spacious lodging show.
10906,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10907,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1360
10908,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10909,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,And now the day was ended / and they did rest the night
10910,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Until beheld they shining / once more the morning light.
10911,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Soon on charger mounted / again was many a man:
10912,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Heigho, what merry pastime, / the king to honor, they began!"
10913,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10914,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1361
10915,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10916,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,By the Huns the monarch / bade honors high be shown.
10917,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Soon rode they forth from Tulna / unto Vienna town,"
10918,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Where found they many a lady / decked out in fair array:
10919,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The same the monarch Etzel's / wife received in stately way.
10920,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10921,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1362
10922,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10923,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,In very fullest measure / upon them there did wait
10924,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Whate'er they might desire. / Of knights the joy was great,"
10925,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Looking toward the revel. / Lodging then sought each one.
10926,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The wedding of the monarch / was in merry wise begun.
10927,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10928,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1363
10929,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10930,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Yet not for all might lodging / within the town be had.
10931,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"All that were not strangers, / Ruediger them bade"
10932,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That they find them lodgings / beyond the city's bound.
10933,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,I ween that at all seasons / by Lady Kriemhild's side was found
10934,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10935,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1364
10936,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10937,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"The noble Sir Dietrich / and many another thane,"
10938,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Who amid their labors / but little rest had ta'en,"
10939,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That the guests they harbored / of merry mood should be.
10940,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,For Ruediger and his companions / went the time full pleasantly.
10941,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10942,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1365
10943,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10944,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"The wedding time was fallen / upon a Whitsuntide,"
10945,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,When the monarch Etzel / lay Kriemhild beside
10946,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,In the town at Vienna. / So many men I ween
10947,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Through her former husband / had not in her service been.
10948,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10949,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1366
10950,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10951,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Many that ne'er had seen her / did her rich bounty take,"
10952,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,And many a one among them / unto the strangers spake:
10953,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"""We deemed that Lady Kriemhild / of wealth no more had aught"
10954,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Now hath she by her giving / here full many a wonder wrought."""
10955,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10956,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1367
10957,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10958,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The wedding-feast it lasted / for days full seventeen.
10959,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Ne'er of other monarch / hath any told, I ween,"
10960,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That wedded with more splendor: / of such no tale we hear.
10961,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"All that there were present, / new-made apparel did they wear."
10962,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10963,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1368
10964,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10965,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,I ween that far in Netherland / sat she ne'er before
10966,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Amid such host of warriors. / And this believe I more:
10967,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Was Siegfried rich in treasure, / that yet he ne'er did gain,"
10968,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"As here she saw 'fore Etzel, / so many a high and noble thane."
10969,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10970,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1369
10971,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10972,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Nor e'er gave any other / at his own wedding-tide
10973,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"So many a costly mantle / flowing long and wide,"
10974,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Nor yet so rich apparel / --so may ye well believe--
10975,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,As here from hand of Kriemhild / did they one and all receive.
10976,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10977,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1370
10978,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10979,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Her friends and eke the strangers / were of a single mind,"
10980,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That they would not be sparing / of treasure in any kind:
10981,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"What any from them desired, / they gave with willing hand."
10982,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Many a thane from giving / himself of clothing reft did stand.
10983,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10984,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1371
10985,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10986,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"How by her noble husband / at the Rhine a queen she sat,"
10987,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Of that she still was minded, / and her eye grew wet thereat."
10988,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Yet well she kept it hidden / that none the same might mark.
10989,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Now had she wealth of honor / after long years of sorrow dark.
10990,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10991,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1372
10992,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10993,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"What any did with bounty, / 'twas but an idle wind"
10994,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,By side of Dietrich's giving: / what Etzel's generous mind
10995,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Before to him had given, / complete did disappear."
10996,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Eke wrought there many a wonder / the hand of bounteous Ruediger.
10997,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
10998,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1373
10999,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11000,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Bloedelein the chieftain / that came from Hunland,"
11001,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Full many a chest to empty / did he then command,"
11002,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Of gold and eke of silver. / That did they freely give.
11003,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Right merrily the warriors / of the monarch saw ye live.
11004,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11005,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1374
11006,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11007,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Likewise the monarch's minstrels / Werbel and Schwemmelein,"

11012,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1375
11013,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11014,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Upon the eighteenth morning / from Vienna town they went.
11015,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Then in knightly pastime / many a shield was rent
11016,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,By spear full well directed / by doughty rider's hand.
11017,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,So came the royal Etzel / riding into Hunland.
11018,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11019,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1376
11020,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11021,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,At Heimburg's ancient castle / they tarried over night.
11022,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Tell the tale of people / no mortal ever might,"
11023,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,And the number of good warriors / did o'er the country come.
11024,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Ah, what fairest women / were gathered unto Etzel's home!"
11025,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11026,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1377
11027,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11028,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,By Miesenburg's majestic / towers did they embark.
11029,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"With horses eke and riders / the water all was dark,"
11030,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"As if 'twere earth they trod on, / as far as eye might see."
11031,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,The way-worn ladies rested / now on board right pleasantly.
11032,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11033,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1378
11034,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11035,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Now was lashed together / many a boat full good,"
11036,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That no harm they suffered / from the waves and flood.
11037,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Many a stately awning / likewise above them spread,"
11038,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Just as if beneath them / had they land and flowery mead.
11039,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11040,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1379
11041,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11042,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"When to Etzelburg the tidings / soon were borne along,"

11044,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Who once the Lady Helke / as mistress did obey,"
11045,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Anon by Lady Kriemhild / lived they many a gladsome day.
11046,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11047,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1380
11048,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11049,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"There did stand expectant / full many a maid high-born,"
11050,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That since the death of Helke / had pined all forlorn.
11051,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Daughters of seven monarchs / Kriemhild there waiting found,"
11052,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That were the high adornment / of all King Etzel's country round.
11053,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11054,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1381
11055,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11056,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Herrat, a lofty princess, / did all the train obey,"

11062,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11063,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Against the strangers' coming / her heart with joy flowed o'er:

11065,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Who might e'er give the picture, / how the king eft sat on throne?"
11066,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Nor had with any mistress / the Huns such joyous living known.
11067,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11068,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1383
11069,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11070,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"As with his spouse the monarch / up from the river came,"
11071,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Unto the noble Kriemhild / of each they told the name
11072,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,'Mong them that she did find there: / she fairer each did greet.
11073,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Ah, how mighty mistress / she long did sit in Helke's seat!"

11075,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1384
11076,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11077,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Ready and true the service / to her was offered there.
11078,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"The queen dealt out in plenty / gold and raiment rare,"
11079,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Silver eke and jewels. / What over Rhine she brought
11080,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"With her unto Hunland, / soon thereof retained she naught."
11081,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11082,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1385
11083,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11084,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Eke in faithful service / she to herself did win
11085,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"All the king's warriors / and all his royal kin,"
11086,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,--So that ne'er did Lady Helke / so mighty power wield
11087,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,As until death to Kriemhild / such host did willing service yield.
11088,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11089,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,1386
11090,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11091,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Thus stood so high in honor / the court and country round,"
11092,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That there at every season / was pleasant pastime found
11093,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"By each, whithersoever / his heart's desire might stand:"
11094,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,That wrought the monarch's favor / and the queen's full bounteous hand.
11095,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11096,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
11097,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,

11110,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,1388
11111,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
11112,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Yet would she not give over, / nor with aught be reconciled,"

11121,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Herrat the stranger maiden / many a grace she taught,"
11122,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,Who yet with secret pining / for her mistress Helke was distraught.
11123,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
11124,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,1390
11125,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
11126,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"To stranger and to native / full well she soon was known,"
11127,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Ne'er monarch's country, said they, / did royal mistress own"
11128,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"That gave with freer bounty, / that held they without fear."
11129,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Such praise she bore in Hunland, / until was come the thirteenth year."

11131,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,1391
11132,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
11133,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Now had she well perceived / how all obeyed her will,"
11134,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"As service to royal mistress / king's knights do render still,"
11135,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,And how at every season / twelve kings 'fore her were seen.
11136,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,She thought of many a sorrow / that wrought upon her once had been.
11137,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
11138,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,1392
11139,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,

11142,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,Of it all had reft her / with her lord Siegfried dead;
11143,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,She thought for so great evil / how might he ever be repaid.
11144,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,

11184,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"The treasure wielded Eckewart, / and won good knights thereby."
11185,TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,The will of Lady Kriemhild might / none in all that land deny.

15770,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2040
15771,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15772,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,On Hagen might not Iring / wreak aught of injury.
15773,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Unto the doughty Fiddler / in haste then turned he.
15774,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Him by his mighty sword-strokes / thought he to subdue,"
15775,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,But well the thane full gallant / to keep him safe in combat knew.
15776,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15777,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2041
15778,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15779,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then smote the doughty Fiddler / so lustily his shield
15780,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,That from it flew its ornaments / where he the sword did wield.
15781,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Iring must leave unconquered / there the dauntless man;
15782,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Next upon King Gunther / of Burgundy in wrath he ran.
15783,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15784,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2042
15785,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15786,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,There did each in combat / show him man of might;
15787,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Howe'er did Gunther and Iring / yet each the other smite,"
15788,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"From wounds might never either / make the blood to flow,"
15789,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"So sheltered each his armor, / well wrought that was and strong enow."
15790,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15791,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2043
15792,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15793,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther left he standing, / upon Gernot to dash,"
15794,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,And when he smote ring-armor / the fire forth did flash.
15795,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"But soon had he of Burgundy, / Gernot the doughty thane,"
15796,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Well nigh his keen assailant / Iring of Denmark slain.
15797,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15798,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2044
15799,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15800,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Yet from the prince he freed him, / for nimble was he too."
15801,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Four of the men of Burgundy / the knight full sudden slew
15802,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Of those that followed with them / from Worms across the Rhine.
15803,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Thereupon might nothing / the wrath of Giselher confine.
15804,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15805,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2045
15806,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15807,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""God wot well, Sir Iring,"" / young Giselher then cried,"
15808,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Now must thou make requital / for them that here have died"
15809,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"'Neath thy hand so sudden."" / He rushed upon him so"
15810,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,And smote the knight of Denmark / that he might not withstand the blow.
15811,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15812,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2046
15813,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15814,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Into the blood down fell he / staggering 'neath its might,"
15815,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,That all who there beheld it / might deem the noble knight
15816,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Sword again would never / wield amid the fray.
15817,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Yet 'neath the stroke of Giselher / Iring all unwounded lay.
15818,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15819,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2047
15820,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15821,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Bedazed by helmet's sounding / where ringing sword swung down,"
15822,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Full suddenly his senses / so from the knight were flown:
15823,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,That of his life no longer / harbored he a thought.
15824,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,That the doughty Giselher / by his mighty arm had wrought.
15825,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15826,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2048
15827,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15828,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,When somewhat was subsided / the din within his head
15829,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"From mighty blow so sudden / on him was visited,"
15830,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Thought he: ""I still am living / and bear no mortal wound."
15831,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"How great the might of Giselher, / till now unwitting, have I found."""
15832,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15833,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2049
15834,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15835,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,He hearkened how on all sides / his foes around did stand;
15836,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Knew they what he did purpose, / they had not stayed their hand."
15837,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"He heard the voice of Giselher / eke in that company,"
15838,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,As cunning he bethought him / how yet he from his foes might flee.
15839,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15840,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2050
15841,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15842,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Up from the blood he started / with fierce and sudden bound;
15843,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,By grace alone of swiftness / he his freedom found.
15844,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"With speed he passed the portal / where Hagen yet did stand,"
15845,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,And swift his sword he flourished / and smote him with his doughty hand.
15846,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15847,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2051
15848,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15849,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"To see such sight quoth Hagen: / ""To death thou fall'st a prey;"
15850,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"If not the Devil shield thee, / now is thy latest day."""
15851,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Yet Iring wounded Hagen / e'en through his helmet's crown.
15852,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"That did the knight with Waske, / a sword that was of far renown."
15853,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15854,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2052
15855,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15856,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"When thus Sir Hagen / the smart of wound did feel,"
15857,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Wrathfully he brandished / on high his blade of steel.
15858,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Full soon must yield before him / Hawart's daring man,"
15859,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Adown the steps pursuing / Hagen swiftly after ran.
15860,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15861,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2053
15862,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15863,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"O'er his head bold Iring / his shield to guard him swung,"
15864,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"And e'en had that same stairway / been full three times as long,"
15865,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Yet had he found no respite / from warding Hagen's blows.
15866,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,How plenteously the ruddy / sparks above his helm arose!
15867,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15868,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2054
15869,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15870,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Unscathed at last came Iring / where waited him his own.
15871,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Soon as was the story / unto Kriemhild known,"
15872,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"How that in fight on Hagen / he had wrought injury,"
15873,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Therefor the Lady Kriemhild / him gan to thank full graciously.
15874,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15875,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2055
15876,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15877,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Now God requite thee, Iring, / thou valiant knight and good,"
15878,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,For thou my heart hast comforted / and merry made my mood.
15879,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Red with blood his armor, / see I yonder Hagen stand."""
15880,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,For joy herself did Kriemhild / take his shield from out his hand.
15881,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15882,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2056
15883,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15884,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Small cause hast thou to thank him,"" / thus wrathful Hagen spake;"
15885,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""For gallant knight 'twere fitting / trial once more to make."
15886,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"If then returned he scatheless, / a valiant man he were."
15887,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,The wound doth boot thee little / that now from his hand I bear.
15888,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15889,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2057
15890,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15891,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""That here from wound upon me / my mail-coat see'st thou red,"

15894,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"As yet in sooth hath Iring / wrought on me but little bane."""
15895,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15896,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2058
15897,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15898,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Iring then of Denmark / stood where fanned the wind.
15899,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,He cooled him in his armor / and did his helm unbind.
15900,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Then praised him all the people / and spoke him man of might,"
15901,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Whereat the margrave's bosom / swelled full high with proud delight.
15902,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15903,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2059
15904,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15905,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"""Now hearken friends unto me,"" / Iring once more spake;"

15908,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"New shield they brought, for Hagen / did his erstwhile asunder hew."
15909,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15910,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2060
15911,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15912,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Soon stood again the warrior / in armor all bedight.
15913,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"In hand a spear full massy / took the wrathful knight,"
15914,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Wherewith on yonder Hagen / he thought to vent his hate.
15915,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,With grim and fearful visage / on him the vengeful thane did wait.
15916,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15917,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2061
15918,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15919,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Yet not abide his coming / might Hagen longer now.
15920,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Adown he rushed upon him / with many a thrust and blow,"
15921,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Down where the stairway ended / for fierce did burn his ire.
15922,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Soon the might of Iring / must 'neath his furious onset tire,"
15923,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15924,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2062
15925,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15926,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Their shields they smote asunder / that the sparks began
15927,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,To fly in ruddy showers. / Hawart's gallant man
15928,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Was by sword of Hagen / wounded all so sore

15930,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15931,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2063
15932,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15933,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"When how great the wound was / Iring fully knew,"
15934,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Better to guard his helm-band / his shield he higher drew.
15935,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"The scathe he first received / he deemed sufficient quite,"
15936,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Yet injury far greater / soon had he from King Gunther's knight.
15937,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15938,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2064
15939,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15940,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,From where it lay before him / Hagen a spear did lift

15942,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"It pierced his head, and firmly / fixed the shaft did stand;"
15943,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Full grim the end that met him / 'neath the doughty Hagen's hand.

15945,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2065
15946,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15947,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Backward Iring yielded / unto his Danish men.
15948,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Ere for the knight his helmet / they undid again,"
15949,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,From his head they drew the spear-point; / to death he was anigh.
15950,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Wept thereat his kinsmen, / and sore need had verily."
15951,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15952,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,2066
15953,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,
15954,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"Came thereto Queen Kriemhild / and o'er the warrior bent,"
15955,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,And for the doughty Iring / gan she there lament.
15956,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"She wept to see him wounded, / and sorely grieved the queen."
15957,THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,Then spake unto his kinsmen / the warrior full brave and keen.
