58,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
59,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,This translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The
60,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Authoress of the Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give"
61,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the whole “Odyssey” in that book without making it unwieldy, I"
62,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"therefore epitomised my translation, which was already completed and"
63,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,which I now publish in full.
64,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
65,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,I shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just
66,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"mentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I"
67,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,have there written. The points in question are:
68,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
69,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"(1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely"
70,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"from, the place now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike"
71,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,as regards the Phaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of
72,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Ulysses, when once he is within easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves"
73,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"into a periplus of the island, practically from Trapani back to"
74,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits of Messina, and the island"
75,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,of Pantellaria.
76,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
77,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived"
78,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"at the place now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work"
79,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,under the name of Nausicaa.
80,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
81,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,The main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat
82,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"startling contentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the"
83,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,English and Italian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder)
84,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"in the “Athenaeum” for January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both"
85,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,contentions were urged (also without rejoinder) in the Johnian “Eagle”
86,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,for the Lent and October terms of the same year. Nothing to which I
87,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"should reply has reached me from any quarter, and knowing how anxiously"
88,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in my argument,"
89,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"I begin to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I should"
90,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"have heard, at any rate about some of them, before now. Without,"
91,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"therefore, for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally"
92,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"acquiesce in my conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely"
93,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"so to gainsay me as that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and"
94,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"shall confine myself to translating the “Odyssey” for English readers,"
95,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,with such notes as I think will be found useful. Among these I would
96,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,especially call attention to one on xxii. 465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe
97,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,has kindly allowed me to make public.
98,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
99,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,I have repeated several of the illustrations used in “The Authoress of
100,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the Odyssey”, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court"
101,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,of Ulysses’ house more vividly before the reader. I should like to
102,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,explain that the presence of a man and a dog in one illustration is
103,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"accidental, and was not observed by me till I developed the negative."
104,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,In an appendix I have also reprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the
105,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"plan of Ulysses’ house, together with the plan itself. The reader is"
106,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,recommended to study this plan with some attention.
107,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
108,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,In the preface to my translation of the “Iliad” I have given my views
109,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"as to the main principles by which a translator should be guided, and"
110,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"need not repeat them here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty"
111,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,of translating poetry into prose involves the continual taking of more
112,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,or less liberty throughout the translation; for much that is right in
113,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"poetry is wrong in prose, and the exigencies of readable prose are the"
114,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"first things to be considered in a prose translation. That the reader,"
115,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"however, may see how far I have departed from strict construe, I will"
116,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s translation of the sixty lines or
117,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,so of the “Odyssey.” Their translation runs:
118,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
119,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered far and"
120,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy, and many were the"
121,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes"
122,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"he suffered in his heart on the deep, striving to win his own life and"
123,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the return of his company. Nay, but even so he saved not his company,"
124,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,though he desired it sore. For through the blindness of their own
125,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion:"
126,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these things,"
127,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,"
128,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,declare thou even unto us.
129,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
130,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at"
131,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"home, and had escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving"
132,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"for his wife and for his homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso"
133,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"held, that fair goddess, in her hollow caves, longing to have him"
134,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,for her lord. But when now the year had come in the courses of the
135,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home"
136,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"to Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even among"
137,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"his own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged"
138,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own"
139,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,country. Howbeit Poseidon had now departed for the distant
140,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the"
141,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where"
142,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and
143,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"rams, there he made merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods"
144,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,were gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the
145,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"father of men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his"
146,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon, far-famed"
147,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals:"
148,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us"
149,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the"
150,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is"
151,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was"
152,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and"
153,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his"
154,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"eyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the"
155,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the"
156,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at"
157,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man’s estate and"
158,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed not on"
159,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid"
160,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,one price for all.’
161,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
162,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father,"
163,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly"
164,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,lies in a death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work
165,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"such deeds! But my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, the hapless"
166,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction"
167,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle,"
168,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the"
169,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself"
170,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His
171,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow: and ever with
172,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of
173,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap
174,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine"
175,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by"
176,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in
177,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O"
178,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Zeus?’
179,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
180,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
181,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,The “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from
182,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the “Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type,"
183,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"with marginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this"
184,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"end in my MS. I found, however, that the translation would be thus"
185,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"hopelessly scholasticised, and abandoned my intention. I would"
186,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,nevertheless urge on those who have the management of our University
187,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"presses, that they would render a great service to students if they"
188,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,would publish a Greek text of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages
189,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"printed in a different type, and with marginal references. I have given"
190,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages
191,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,underlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked
192,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"with all the Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of"
193,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,both the “Iliad” and “Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach
194,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,of all students.
195,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
196,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen
197,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"round the “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his"
198,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,reader’s mind that the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one
199,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"single neighbourhood, and hence (even though nothing else pointed to"
200,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,this conclusion) presumably by one person only—that it was written
201,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"certainly before 750, and in all probability before 1000 B.C.—that the"
202,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the
203,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"“Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those books whose"
204,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are admitted to"
205,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his readers,"
206,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who"
207,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,will mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British
208,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Museum above referred to, and who will draw the only inference that"
209,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,common sense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages
210,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"in both poems, will, I believe, find no difficulty in assigning their"
211,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,proper value to a large number of books here and on the Continent that
212,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"at present enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore, and this"
213,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"perhaps is an advantage better worth securing, he will find that many"
214,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they
215,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”
216,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
217,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Other difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of
218,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,the poem in the writer’s mind is understood. I have dealt with this at
219,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"some length in pp. 251-261 of “The Authoress of the Odyssey”. Briefly,"
220,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,the “Odyssey” consists of two distinct poems: (1) The Return of
221,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Ulysses, which alone the Muse is asked to sing in the opening lines of"
222,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian episode, and the account of"
223,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii. It consists of
224,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v., and thence"
225,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at which"
226,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,point the original scheme was abandoned.
227,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
228,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of"
229,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Telemachus’ voyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of
230,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Book i., is continued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till"
231,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Ulysses wakes in the middle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it"
232,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,continues to the end of Book xxiv.
233,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
234,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"In “The Authoress of the Odyssey”, I wrote:"
235,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
236,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the introduction of lines xi., 115-137 and of line ix., 535, with the"
237,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"writing a new council of the gods at the beginning of Book v., to take"
238,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"the place of the one that was removed to Book i., 1-79, were the only"
239,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,things that were done to give even a semblance of unity to the old
240,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"scheme and the new, and to conceal the fact that the Muse, after being"
241,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"asked to sing of one subject, spend two-thirds of her time in singing a"
242,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"very different one, with a climax for which no-one has asked her. For"
243,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"roughly the Return occupies eight Books, and Penelope and the Suitors"
244,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,sixteen.
245,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
246,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
247,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,I believe this to be substantially correct.
248,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,
249,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"Lastly, to deal with a very unimportant point, I observe that the"
250,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,Leipsic Teubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a
251,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,comma. Stops are things of such far more recent date than the
252,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"“Odyssey,” that there does not seem much use in adhering to the text in"
253,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"so small a matter; still, from a spirit of mere conservatism, I have"
254,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,preferred to do so. Why [Greek] at the beginnings of Books ii. and
255,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"viii., and [Greek], at the beginning of Book vii. should have initial"
256,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,capitals in an edition far too careful to admit a supposition of
257,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"inadvertence, when [Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and xiii., and"
258,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,"[Greek] at the beginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals, I"
259,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,cannot determine. No other Books of the “Odyssey” have initial capitals
260,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,except the three mentioned unless the first word of the Book is a
261,PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION,proper name.

274,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Butler’s Translation of the “Odyssey” appeared originally in 1900, and"
275,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,The Authoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition
276,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of “The Authoress”, which is published simultaneously with this new"
277,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"edition of the Translation, I have given some account of the genesis of"
278,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,the two books.
279,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
280,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,The size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both books
281,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"uniform with Butler’s other works; and, fortunately, it has been"
282,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"possible, by using a smaller type, to get the same number of words into"
283,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"each page, so that the references remain good, and, with the exception"
284,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,of a few minor alterations and rearrangements now to be enumerated so
285,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"far as they affect the Translation, the new editions are faithful"
286,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"reprints of the original editions, with misprints and obvious errors"
287,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,corrected—no attempt having been made to edit them or to bring them up
288,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,to date.
289,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
290,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,(a) The Index has been revised.
291,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
292,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been
293,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"necessary to shorten some of the headlines, and here advantage has been"
294,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,taken of various corrections of and additions to the headlines and
295,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,shoulder-notes made by Butler in his own copies of the two books.
296,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
297,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,"
298,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,whereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on the
299,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,page. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.
300,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
301,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,On page 153 of “The Authoress” Butler says: “No great poet would
302,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"compare his hero to a paunch full of blood and fat, cooking before the"
303,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"fire (xx, 24-28).” This passage is not given in the abridged Story of"
304,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the “Odyssey” at the beginning of the book, but in the Translation it"
305,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,occurs in these words:
306,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
307,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"“Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he"
308,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
309,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of a hot fire, doing it first on one side then on the other, that he"
310,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,may get it cooked as soon as possible; even so did he turn himself
311,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single-handed as he"
312,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked"
313,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,suitors.”
314,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
315,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,It looks as though in the interval between the publication of “The
316,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Authoress” (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his
317,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,mind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a
318,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"paunch full, etc., and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man"
319,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"who turns a paunch full, etc. The second comparison is perhaps one"
320,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,which a great poet might make.
321,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
322,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,In seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable
323,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"assistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,"
324,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Cambridge, and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College,"
325,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Cambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for the
326,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,care and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time for the
327,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,labour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and
328,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"references to the “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” and I believe that it could"
329,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"not have been better performed. It was, I know, a pleasure for him; and"
330,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,it would have been a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known
331,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"that his work was being shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H."
332,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"R. Robertson, who more than half a century ago was a fellow-student"
333,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"with him at Cary’s School of Art in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury."

364,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him"
365,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there"
366,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;
367,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were"
368,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him
369,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not"
370,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,let him get home.
371,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
372,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world’s end,"
373,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.1 He had"
374,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying"
375,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of
376,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment"
377,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon’s son"
378,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Orestes; so he said to the other gods:
379,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
380,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing"
381,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to
382,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Agamemnon’s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew"
383,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do
384,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his"
385,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him
386,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for"
387,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,everything in full.”
388,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
389,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Then Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served"
390,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but"
391,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart
392,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,"
393,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with"
394,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,"
395,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the"
396,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth"
397,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,"
398,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his
399,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may"
400,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of"
401,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you"
402,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry
403,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,with him?”
404,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
405,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"And Jove said, “My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget"
406,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more"
407,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear
408,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having"
409,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to
410,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys;"
411,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by"
412,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together"
413,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified,"
414,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.”
415,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
416,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"And Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the"
417,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send"
418,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our
419,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to"
420,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,put heart into Ulysses’ son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the
421,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother"
422,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I"
423,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear"
424,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,anything about the return of his dear father—for this will make people
425,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,speak well of him.”
426,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
427,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,"
428,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the
429,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong,"
430,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and"
431,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith"
432,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses’ house, disguised as a"
433,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in"
434,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the
435,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of"
436,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon
437,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning"
438,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some"
439,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,cutting up great quantities of meat.
440,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
441,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily
442,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would"
443,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again"
444,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them,"
445,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was"
446,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took
447,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. “Welcome,”"
448,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"said he, “to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall"
449,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,tell us what you have come for.”
450,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
451,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were"
452,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,within he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong
453,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father,"
454,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a
455,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,2 and he set"
456,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she"
457,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and"
458,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,that he might ask her more freely about his father.
459,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
460,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and
461,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she"
462,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread,"
463,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the"
464,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold
465,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"by their side, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for"
466,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,them.
467,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
468,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
469,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and
470,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"seats.3 Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids"
471,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with"
472,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that"
473,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they
474,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a"
475,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled"
476,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to
477,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that"
478,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,no man might hear.
479,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
480,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“I hope, sir,” said he, “that you will not be offended with what I am"
481,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and"
482,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some
483,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see
484,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather
485,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has"
486,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is"
487,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,"
488,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from."
489,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how"
490,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared"
491,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"themselves to be—for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly,"
492,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been"
493,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,here in my father’s time? In the old days we had many visitors for my
494,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,father went about much himself.”
495,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
496,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"And Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about"
497,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I"
498,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign"
499,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"tongue being bound for Temesa4 with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring"
500,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country"
501,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron5 under the wooded mountain"
502,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Neritum.6 Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell"
503,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes"
504,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with"
505,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when he"
506,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your
507,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the"
508,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the"
509,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean,"
510,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I
511,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is"
512,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away"
513,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were
514,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But
515,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking"
516,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head
517,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where"
518,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never
519,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,either of us seen the other.”
520,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
521,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“My mother,” answered Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it"
522,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one
523,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is"
524,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my
525,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,father.”
526,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
527,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"And Minerva said, “There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while"
528,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,"
529,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?"
530,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in"
531,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,the family—for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own?
532,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,And the guests—how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make
533,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person
534,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,who comes near them.”
535,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
536,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“Sir,” said Telemachus, “as regards your question, so long as my father"
537,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their"
538,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more"
539,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it
540,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before"
541,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting"
542,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his
543,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the"
544,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone
545,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing"
546,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of
547,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the
548,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island"
549,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are"
550,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my
551,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry,7 nor"
552,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and"
553,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,before long will do so also with myself.”
554,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
555,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“Is that so?” exclaimed Minerva, “then you do indeed want Ulysses home"
556,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he"
557,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and"
558,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,"
559,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming
560,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus,"
561,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give
562,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him."
563,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short
564,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,shrift and a sorry wedding.
565,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
566,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,"
567,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you"
568,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my
569,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your"
570,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors"
571,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother’s mind"
572,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find"
573,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear
574,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take"
575,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest"
576,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you
577,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some"
578,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;
579,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all"
580,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way
581,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet"
582,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come"
583,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a"
584,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having"
585,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or"
586,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to"
587,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing
588,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Orestes’ praises for having killed his father’s murderer Aegisthus? You
589,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make"
590,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and"
591,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think"
592,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.”"
593,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
594,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me"
595,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell"
596,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a"
597,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will
598,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will"
599,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,give you one of great beauty and value—a keepsake such as only dear
600,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,friends give to one another.”
601,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
602,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Minerva answered, “Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at"
603,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I"
604,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very"
605,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.”"
606,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
607,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had"
608,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about"
609,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the"
610,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were"
611,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,sitting.
612,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
613,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he"
614,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had"
615,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song"
616,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not"
617,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the"
618,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof
619,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,of the cloisters8 with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a
620,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly."
621,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
622,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“Phemius,” she cried, “you know many another feat of gods and heroes,"
623,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,"
624,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for"
625,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I"
626,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas"
627,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,and middle Argos.”9
628,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
629,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“Mother,” answered Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind"
630,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who"
631,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own"
632,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated
633,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most"
634,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only
635,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well"
636,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily"
637,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for"
638,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"speech is man’s matter, and mine above all others 10—for it is I who am"
639,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,master here.”
640,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
641,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in"
642,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she"
643,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.
644,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters11, and"
645,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.
646,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
647,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Then Telemachus spoke, “Shameless,” he cried, “and insolent suitors,"
648,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it"
649,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;
650,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal
651,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"notice to depart, and feast at one another’s houses, turn and turn"
652,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in"
653,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you"
654,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"in full, and when you fall in my father’s house there shall be no man"
655,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,to avenge you.”
656,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
657,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the"
658,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, “The"
659,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may
660,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before
661,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,you.”
662,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
663,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Telemachus answered, “Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,"
664,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of
665,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and"
666,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in"
667,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;"
668,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom"
669,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,Ulysses has won for me.”
670,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
671,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, “It rests with heaven to"
672,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own"
673,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in
674,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I"
675,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of
676,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news"
677,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He"
678,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"seemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was"
679,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,gone in a moment before we could get to know him.”
680,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
681,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"“My father is dead and gone,” answered Telemachus, “and even if some"
682,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed
683,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his"
684,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"prophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of"
685,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father’s.” But in"
686,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.
687,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,
688,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the
689,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to
690,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,bed each in his own abode.12 Telemachus’s room was high up in a tower13
691,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and"
692,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son"
693,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes"
694,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the
695,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his"
696,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to"
697,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,his bed for he feared his wife’s resentment.14 She it was who now
698,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of"
699,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a"
700,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as
701,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"he took off his shirt15 he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it"
702,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which"
703,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,"she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt"
704,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,home by means of the strap.16 But Telemachus as he lay covered with a
705,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage
706,TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.,and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.

718,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
719,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus"
720,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,"
721,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an"
722,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in
723,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,"
724,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in"
725,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"hand—not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him"
726,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as
727,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"he went by, and when he took his place in his father’s seat even the"
728,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,oldest councillors made way for him.
729,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
730,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was"
731,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"the first to speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,"
732,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they"
733,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.17"
734,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father’s"
735,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless"
736,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still"
737,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,weeping for him when he began his speech.
738,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
739,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Men of Ithaca,” he said, “hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us"
740,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it
741,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has"
742,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or"
743,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is
744,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart’s"
745,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,desire.”
746,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
747,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he"
748,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the
749,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,"
750,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"turning to Aegyptius, “Sir,” said he, “it is I, as you will shortly"
751,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I"
752,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you,"
753,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My
754,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which"
755,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my
756,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was"
757,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and"
758,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief
759,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will.
760,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him to choose the"
761,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but"
762,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"day by day they keep hanging about my father’s house, sacrificing our"
763,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much"
764,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand
765,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our
766,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days"
767,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had"
768,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house"
769,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own"
770,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest"
771,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and
772,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold"
773,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded18—unless it be that my"
774,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now
775,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am"
776,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the"
777,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some"
778,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid"
779,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"in full, whereas now I have no remedy.”19"
780,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
781,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into
782,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no"
783,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke"
784,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,thus:
785,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
786,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw"
787,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother’s fault not ours, for she"
788,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she"
789,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"had been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us,"
790,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And
791,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great
792,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of"
793,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"fine needlework. ‘Sweet hearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead,"
794,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait—for I would not"
795,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,have skill in needlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall
796,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death"
797,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk"
798,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,if he is laid out without a pall.’
799,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
800,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her"
801,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick"
802,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three
803,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now"
804,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told"
805,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to"
806,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you"
807,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand—‘Send your"
808,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father’s"
809,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,choice’; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us
810,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the
811,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is so clever."
812,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena,"
813,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing to your"
814,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"mother any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us in that way,"
815,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now
816,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate; and I do not"
817,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and glory, and"
818,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not"
819,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her"
820,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,choice and married some one or other of us.”
821,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
822,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Telemachus answered, “Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me"
823,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,from my father’s house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether
824,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the
825,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter
826,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will"
827,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on
828,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing"
829,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take"
830,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another’s"
831,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you"
832,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"elect to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove"
833,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house"
834,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,there shall be no man to avenge you.”
835,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
836,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"As he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they"
837,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly"
838,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they
839,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring"
840,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely"
841,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the"
842,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what"
843,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"all this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best prophet and"
844,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,"
845,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,saying:
846,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
847,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors,"
848,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away
849,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and
850,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live in"
851,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness"
852,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be
853,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;"
854,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set
855,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much"
856,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the
857,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is
858,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,coming true.”
859,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
860,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, “Go home, old man, and prophesy to"
861,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens"
862,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the
863,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has"
864,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with"
865,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger"
866,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he
867,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"will give you something for your family, but I tell you—and it shall"
868,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"surely be—when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a"
869,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his"
870,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,young friend will only fare so much the worse—he will take nothing by
871,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"it, for the suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a"
872,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for"
873,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the"
874,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"presence of you all to send his mother back to her father, who will"
875,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear
876,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on harassing him with our
877,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine"
878,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much"
879,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back"
880,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"and continue to eat up Telemachus’s estate without paying him, till"
881,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day
882,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in"
883,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go
884,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"after the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the"
885,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,way in which she treats us.”
886,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
887,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Then Telemachus said, “Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say"
888,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of"
889,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty"
890,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos"
891,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell
892,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"me something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some"
893,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on
894,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet
895,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will"
896,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a"
897,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.”"
898,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
899,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"With these words he sat down, and Mentor20 who had been a friend of"
900,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority"
901,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty"
902,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,addressed them thus:
903,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
904,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and"
905,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I"
906,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for"
907,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as"
908,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,"
909,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,"
910,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the"
911,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at"
912,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such
913,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"scandalous goings on—which you could do if you chose, for you are many"
914,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,and they are few.”
915,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
916,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, “Mentor, what folly is"
917,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing"
918,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses
919,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do"
920,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would"
921,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own"
922,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what
923,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your"
924,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,"
925,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I do not think"
926,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes"
927,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,and tells him something.”
928,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
929,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own"
930,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"abode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses."
931,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
932,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the"
933,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"grey waves, and prayed to Minerva."
934,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
935,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Hear me,” he cried, “you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me"
936,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I
937,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked"
938,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.”"
939,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
940,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and"
941,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"with the voice of Mentor. “Telemachus,” said she, “if you are made of"
942,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward
943,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half"
944,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,"
945,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins
946,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as
947,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are"
948,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not"
949,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"entirely without some share of your father’s wise discernment, I look"
950,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause
951,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor"
952,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly"
953,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on the same day."
954,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such"
955,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with"
956,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about among the suitors;"
957,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well
958,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of"
959,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up"
960,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I
961,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get
962,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,her ready and will put out to sea without delay.”
963,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
964,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in"
965,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the"
966,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous
967,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,"
968,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"saying, “Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither"
969,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The"
970,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and a picked crew to
971,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,boot—so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your
972,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,noble father.”
973,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
974,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take"
975,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that
976,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?
977,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and"
978,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you all"
979,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain—though,"
980,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must"
981,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,be passenger not captain.”
982,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
983,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the
984,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings,21 jeering at"
985,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,him tauntingly as they did so.
986,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
987,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means to be the death of us; I"
988,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again"
989,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as"
990,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?”"
991,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
992,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Another said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be"
993,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should
994,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us:"
995,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have
996,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,that.”
997,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
998,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and
999,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,spacious store-room where his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay
1000,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were"
1001,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive"
1002,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god"
1003,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home"
1004,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in
1005,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter"
1006,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and"
1007,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said:
1008,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1009,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are"
1010,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"keeping for my father’s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should"
1011,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve"
1012,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn"
1013,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,leathern bags with barley meal—about twenty measures in all. Get these
1014,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take"
1015,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for
1016,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear
1017,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,anything about the return of my dear father.”
1018,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1019,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,"
1020,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"saying, “My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into"
1021,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"your head? Where in the world do you want to go to—you, who are the one"
1022,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign
1023,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these"
1024,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and"
1025,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are
1026,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life"
1027,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,out on the barren ocean.”
1028,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1029,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Fear not, nurse,” answered Telemachus, “my scheme is not without"
1030,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,heaven’s sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this
1031,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she"
1032,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil"
1033,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,her beauty by crying.”
1034,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1035,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had"
1036,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and"
1037,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to"
1038,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,the suitors.
1039,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1040,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and"
1041,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at"
1042,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked"
1043,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,him to let her have a ship—which he was very ready to do. When the sun
1044,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the"
1045,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and"
1046,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up,"
1047,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.
1048,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1049,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors"
1050,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made"
1051,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over"
1052,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes"
1053,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of
1054,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside."
1055,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1056,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"“Telemachus,” said she, “the men are on board and at their oars,"
1057,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.”"
1058,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1059,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When"
1060,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and"
1061,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Telemachus said, “Now my men, help me to get the stores on board; they"
1062,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know"
1063,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.”"
1064,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1065,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When
1066,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,"
1067,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the
1068,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the"
1069,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair
1070,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"wind from the West,22 that whistled over the deep blue waves23 whereon"
1071,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and"
1072,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross
1073,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they"
1074,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the
1075,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue"
1076,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then"
1077,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls to the"
1078,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from"
1079,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove."
1080,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,
1081,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,"Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night"
1082,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.,from dark till dawn.

1091,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1092,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1093,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,but as the sun was rising from the fair sea24 into the firmament of
1094,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the"
1095,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore
1096,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.
1097,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were"
1098,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats25 and
1099,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,"
1100,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship"
1101,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"to anchor, and went ashore."
1102,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1103,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,"
1104,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have"
1105,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and
1106,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see
1107,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will"
1108,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.”"
1109,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1110,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“But how, Mentor,” replied Telemachus, “dare I go up to Nestor, and how"
1111,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long
1112,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who"
1113,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,is so much older than myself.”
1114,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1115,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Some things, Telemachus,” answered Minerva, “will be suggested to you"
1116,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am"
1117,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth
1118,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,until now.”
1119,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1120,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till"
1121,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were
1122,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his"
1123,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of"
1124,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,meat on to the spits26 while other pieces were cooking. When they saw
1125,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade"
1126,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,them take their places. Nestor’s son Pisistratus at once offered his
1127,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were"
1128,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he
1129,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them
1130,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the"
1131,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,same time.
1132,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1133,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Offer a prayer, sir,” said he, “to King Neptune, for it is his feast"
1134,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink
1135,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt"
1136,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without"
1137,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an"
1138,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"age with myself, so I will give you the precedence.”"
1139,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1140,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and
1141,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,proper of him to have given it to herself first;27 she accordingly
1142,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"began praying heartily to Neptune. “O thou,” she cried, “that"
1143,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"encirclest the earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants"
1144,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,that call upon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace
1145,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian
1146,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering
1147,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of"
1148,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the matter that has brought us in our ship to Pylos.”
1149,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1150,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to"
1151,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were"
1152,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man"
1153,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had
1154,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak."
1155,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1156,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Now,” said he, “that our guests have done their dinner, it will be"
1157,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and"
1158,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the
1159,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man’s hand"
1160,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,against you?”
1161,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1162,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask"
1163,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,about his father and get himself a good name.
1164,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1165,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Nestor,” said he, “son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask"
1166,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under"
1167,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Neritum,28 and the matter about which I would speak is of private not"
1168,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to"
1169,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what
1170,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as"
1171,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is
1172,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor"
1173,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid"
1174,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if"
1175,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you"
1176,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for"
1177,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for
1178,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave"
1179,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when"
1180,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in"
1181,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,my favour and tell me truly all.”
1182,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1183,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“My friend,” answered Nestor, “you recall a time of much sorrow to my"
1184,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while"
1185,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of"
1186,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there—Ajax, Achilles,"
1187,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a"
1188,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much
1189,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?
1190,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or even"
1191,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would"
1192,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we
1193,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us;"
1194,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,during all this time there was no one who could compare with your
1195,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,father in subtlety—if indeed you are his son—I can hardly believe my
1196,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,eyes—and you talk just like him too—no one would say that people of
1197,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any
1198,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but"
1199,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might
1200,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,be ordered for the best.
1201,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1202,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail"
1203,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the"
1204,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise
1205,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the"
1206,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"displeasure of Jove’s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel"
1207,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,between the two sons of Atreus.
1208,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1209,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for"
1210,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they
1211,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"explained why they had called the people together, it seemed that"
1212,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased"
1213,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered"
1214,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might"
1215,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have"
1216,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two stood
1217,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a"
1218,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they should do."
1219,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1220,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching"
1221,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into
1222,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,"
1223,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We—the other"
1224,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"half—embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had"
1225,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the
1226,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet"
1227,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of"
1228,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away"
1229,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the"
1230,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was"
1231,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with"
1232,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our"
1233,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,minds about our course—for we did not know whether to go outside Chios
1234,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over"
1235,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign,"
1236,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of
1237,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we
1238,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage"
1239,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"during the night to Geraestus,29 where we offered many sacrifices to"
1240,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Neptune for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed
1241,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"and his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos,"
1242,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it
1243,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,fair for me.
1244,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1245,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything"
1246,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost
1247,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that"
1248,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the
1249,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles’ son Neoptolemus; so also
1250,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no"
1251,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got"
1252,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you
1253,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at"
1254,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the hands of Aegisthus—and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently
1255,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to
1256,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble"
1257,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"father. You too, then—for you are a tall smart-looking fellow—show your"
1258,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,mettle and make yourself a name in story.”
1259,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1260,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Nestor son of Neleus,” answered Telemachus, “honour to the Achaean"
1261,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all"
1262,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant
1263,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who are"
1264,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such
1265,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear it as best"
1266,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,we may.”
1267,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1268,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“My friend,” said Nestor, “now that you remind me, I remember to have"
1269,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards"
1270,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,"
1271,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows
1272,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in"
1273,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If"
1274,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses
1275,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so
1276,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she"
1277,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would"
1278,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,soon some of them forget their wooing.”
1279,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1280,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus answered, “I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far"
1281,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though
1282,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.”
1283,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1284,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"On this Minerva said, “Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven"
1285,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I"
1286,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I"
1287,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home"
1288,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the"
1289,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when"
1290,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"a man’s hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how"
1291,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,fond they are of him.”
1292,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1293,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Mentor,” answered Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more."
1294,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,There is no chance of my father’s ever coming back; the gods have long
1295,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,"
1296,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than"
1297,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so
1298,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and"
1299,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was
1300,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a
1301,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging"
1302,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed"
1303,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Agamemnon?”
1304,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1305,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“I will tell you truly,” answered Nestor, “and indeed you have yourself"
1306,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had
1307,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no"
1308,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have"
1309,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman"
1310,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but"
1311,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, who was"
1312,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon’s wife"
1313,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.
1314,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1315,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she"
1316,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,was of a good natural disposition;30 moreover there was a bard with
1317,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,"
1318,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled
1319,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"her destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and"
1320,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon—after which she
1321,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many
1322,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with"
1323,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his"
1324,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,expectations.
1325,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1326,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms"
1327,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens,"
1328,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of
1329,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Menelaus’ ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in
1330,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his
1331,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait"
1332,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.
1333,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far"
1334,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow"
1335,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and
1336,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about
1337,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts
1338,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along"
1339,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there
1340,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"is a south wind blowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more"
1341,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this"
1342,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews
1343,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were"
1344,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and"
1345,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at
1346,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed
1347,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him,"
1348,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane,"
1349,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral
1350,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,rites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people
1351,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home,31 with as much"
1352,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,treasure as his ships could carry.
1353,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1354,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far"
1355,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your"
1356,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will"
1357,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"have been on a fool’s errand. Still, I should advise you by all means"
1358,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such"
1359,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the"
1360,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds
1361,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and terrible are the"
1362,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your"
1363,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a
1364,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you"
1365,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and"
1366,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.”"
1367,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1368,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,"
1369,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues"
1370,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings"
1371,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed"
1372,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,time. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a
1373,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,religious festival.”
1374,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1375,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men"
1376,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled"
1377,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving"
1378,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,every man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the
1379,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"victims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink offerings. When"
1380,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was
1381,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship, but"
1382,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.
1383,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1384,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed, “forbid that you should"
1385,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and
1386,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to"
1387,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell
1388,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son"
1389,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship—not while I
1390,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I"
1391,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,have done.”
1392,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1393,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Then Minerva answered, “Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much"
1394,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall"
1395,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give"
1396,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older"
1397,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus’ own age,"
1398,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the
1399,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians
1400,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,"
1401,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let"
1402,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him with your
1403,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,best and fleetest horses.”
1404,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1405,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and"
1406,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took"
1407,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus by the hand. “My friend,” said he, “I see that you are going"
1408,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while"
1409,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,you are still so young. This can have been none other of those who
1410,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"dwell in heaven than Jove’s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who"
1411,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,shewed such favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy
1412,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"queen,” he continued, “vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my"
1413,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a"
1414,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by"
1415,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you"
1416,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,in sacrifice.”
1417,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1418,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to"
1419,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"his own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got"
1420,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed"
1421,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the
1422,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the
1423,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to Minerva, daughter of"
1424,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink offerings and"
1425,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to bed"
1426,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room
1427,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only"
1428,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room"
1429,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"of the house, with the queen his wife by his side."
1430,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1431,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Now when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left"
1432,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble
1433,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of"
1434,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of"
1435,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the"
1436,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,"
1437,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son"
1438,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with"
1439,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,them. Nestor then addressed them.
1440,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1441,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first"
1442,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested"
1443,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"herself visibly to me during yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or"
1444,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,"
1445,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus’ ship,"
1446,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel."
1447,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the
1448,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the"
1449,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats,"
1450,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some
1451,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,clear spring water.”
1452,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1453,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was
1454,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"brought in from the plain, and Telemachus’s crew came from the ship;"
1455,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he"
1456,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"worked his gold, and Minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice."
1457,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer"
1458,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and
1459,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the
1460,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand"
1461,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a
1462,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket."
1463,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley
1464,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from"
1465,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the heifer’s head upon the fire.
1466,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1467,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal32 Thrasymedes
1468,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut"
1469,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and"
1470,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"daughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was"
1471,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted
1472,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the heifer’s head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat."
1473,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They"
1474,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two"
1475,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then"
1476,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while"
1477,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.
1478,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they"
1479,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and"
1480,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,toasted them over the fire.
1481,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1482,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor’s youngest daughter, washed"
1483,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she"
1484,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"brought him a fair mantle and shirt,33 and he looked like a god as he"
1485,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the
1486,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to
1487,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept"
1488,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,pouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had
1489,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"enough to eat and drink Nestor said, “Sons, put Telemachus’s horses to"
1490,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,the chariot that he may start at once.”
1491,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,
1492,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the"
1493,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision
1494,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"of bread, wine, and sweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then"
1495,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Telemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the"
1496,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they
1497,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"flew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high"
1498,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the"
1499,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all
1500,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to"
1501,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and
1502,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning,"
1503,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove"
1504,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse.34 Pisistratus
1505,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they
1506,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"came to the corn lands of the open country, and in the course of time"
1507,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,"completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them.35"
1508,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.,

1521,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"they reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove"
1522,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"straight to the abode of Menelaus36 [and found him in his own house,"
1523,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,"
1524,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that"
1525,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to
1526,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the"
1527,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to the
1528,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’ son was reigning. For his
1529,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"only son he had found a bride from Sparta,37 the daughter of Alector."
1530,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven"
1531,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was"
1532,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,fair as golden Venus herself.
1533,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1534,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making
1535,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,merry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his
1536,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them"
1537,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,when the man struck up with his tune.38
1538,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1539,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,"
1540,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw"
1541,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close
1542,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"up to him and said, “Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two"
1543,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their"
1544,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?”"
1545,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1546,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Menelaus was very angry and said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never"
1547,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses"
1548,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;"
1549,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,you and I have staid often enough at other people’s houses before we
1550,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace"
1551,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,henceforward.”
1552,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1553,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,So Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.
1554,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to"
1555,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they"
1556,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the"
1557,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when
1558,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then,"
1559,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"when they had admired everything to their heart’s content, they went"
1560,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,into the bath room and washed themselves.
1561,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1562,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they"
1563,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by"
1564,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful
1565,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their"
1566,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought
1567,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the"
1568,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and"
1569,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,set cups of gold by their side.
1570,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1571,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Menelaus then greeted them saying, “Fall to, and welcome; when you have"
1572,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you"
1573,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of
1574,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you"
1575,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,are.”
1576,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1577,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"On this he handed them39 a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set"
1578,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good"
1579,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and
1580,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close"
1581,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"that no one might hear, “Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see"
1582,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the gleam of bronze and gold—of amber,40 ivory, and silver. Everything"
1583,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am
1584,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,lost in admiration.”
1585,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1586,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Menelaus overheard him and said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own"
1587,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but"
1588,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"among mortal men—well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I"
1589,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and"
1590,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I"
1591,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the"
1592,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the"
1593,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are"
1594,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that"
1595,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good"
1596,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling"
1597,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly"
1598,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that"
1599,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your
1600,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy"
1601,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,loss in the ruin41 of a stately mansion fully and magnificently
1602,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I
1603,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain"
1604,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for"
1605,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I"
1606,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it."
1607,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for them"
1608,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep,"
1609,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans worked so"
1610,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a"
1611,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we"
1612,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his"
1613,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left"
1614,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.”"
1615,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1616,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he"
1617,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him
1618,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both"
1619,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his
1620,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all"
1621,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,about.
1622,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1623,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted
1624,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought"
1625,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the"
1626,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus
1627,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;"
1628,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten"
1629,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful"
1630,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on"
1631,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by"
1632,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet"
1633,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat,"
1634,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.42"
1635,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1636,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Do we know, Menelaus,” said she, “the names of these strangers who"
1637,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help
1638,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like
1639,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think)
1640,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby"
1641,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts,"
1642,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,on account of my most shameless self.”
1643,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1644,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“My dear wife,” replied Menelaus, “I see the likeness just as you do."
1645,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"His hands and feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the"
1646,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was"
1647,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my"
1648,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.”"
1649,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1650,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then Pisistratus said, “Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in"
1651,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and"
1652,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose
1653,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,"
1654,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could"
1655,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home
1656,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this
1657,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is"
1658,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,no one among his own people to stand by him.”
1659,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1660,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Bless my heart,” replied Menelaus, “then I am receiving a visit from"
1661,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake."
1662,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when
1663,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have
1664,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have"
1665,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and"
1666,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that
1667,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,"
1668,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an
1669,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good"
1670,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at"
1671,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,all.”
1672,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1673,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,"
1674,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his"
1675,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom"
1676,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,"
1677,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1678,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me"
1679,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be"
1680,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am"
1681,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon"
1682,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all
1683,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and
1684,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he
1685,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him—his
1686,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say"
1687,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.”
1688,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1689,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Your discretion, my friend,” answered Menelaus, “is beyond your years."
1690,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is
1691,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and
1692,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"offspring—and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days,"
1693,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who"
1694,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all
1695,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured over"
1696,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the
1697,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,morning.”
1698,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1699,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands"
1700,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.
1701,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1702,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Then Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged
1703,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour."
1704,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest
1705,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop"
1706,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very"
1707,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to"
1708,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all"
1709,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing bowl and others"
1710,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled"
1711,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this"
1712,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round,"
1713,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,she said:
1714,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1715,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable"
1716,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,"
1717,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I"
1718,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the
1719,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,"
1720,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself
1721,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the"
1722,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"enemy’s city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different"
1723,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,from what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he
1724,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone"
1725,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"recognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for"
1726,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him"
1727,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the"
1728,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships,"
1729,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans
1730,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all"
1731,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I"
1732,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I was"
1733,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,"
1734,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is"
1735,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding.”
1736,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1737,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then Menelaus said, “All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is"
1738,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I"
1739,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and"
1740,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the"
1741,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and
1742,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,destruction upon the Trojans.43 At that moment you came up to us; some
1743,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you
1744,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding
1745,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and"
1746,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"mimicked all our wives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside"
1747,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds
1748,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from inside, but"
1749,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except"
1750,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two"
1751,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that"
1752,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away"
1753,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,again.”
1754,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1755,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“How sad,” exclaimed Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save"
1756,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us"
1757,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”"
1758,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1759,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was
1760,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread"
1761,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to
1762,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to"
1763,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did"
1764,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son"
1765,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.
1766,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1767,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose"
1768,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded"
1769,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an"
1770,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:"
1771,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1772,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to"
1773,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Lacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about"
1774,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,it.”
1775,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1776,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus, “to see if you can tell me"
1777,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my
1778,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who"
1779,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of"
1780,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"paying their addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your"
1781,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"knees if haply you may tell me about my father’s melancholy end,"
1782,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other"
1783,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out
1784,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you"
1785,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by
1786,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it"
1787,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.”
1788,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1789,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. “So,” he exclaimed,"
1790,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,“these cowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might as well lay
1791,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in"
1792,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his
1793,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,lair will make short work with the pair of them—and so will Ulysses
1794,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is"
1795,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in
1796,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him—if"
1797,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would have a"
1798,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I"
1799,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without"
1800,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.
1801,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1802,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for"
1803,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are"
1804,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a"
1805,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an"
1806,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,island called Pharos—it has a good harbour from which vessels can get
1807,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,out into open sea when they have taken in water—and here the gods
1808,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to
1809,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men
1810,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved"
1811,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the"
1812,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me."
1813,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1814,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the"
1815,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope"
1816,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.
1817,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it seems to me that you like starving in this"
1818,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"way—at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day"
1819,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"after day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by"
1820,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,inches.’
1821,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1822,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of the goddesses you may happen"
1823,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have"
1824,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods"
1825,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in"
1826,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my"
1827,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,home.’
1828,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1829,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. There"
1830,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is
1831,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is"
1832,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Neptune’s head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom
1833,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you"
1834,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to"
1835,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also tell you, if you so"
1836,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"will, all that has been going on at your house both good and bad, while"
1837,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.’
1838,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1839,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Can you show me,’ said I, ‘some stratagem by means of which I may"
1840,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a
1841,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,god is not easily caught—not by a mortal man.’
1842,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1843,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. About"
1844,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the"
1845,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs"
1846,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and"
1847,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals—Halosydne’s chickens"
1848,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"as they call them—come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in"
1849,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell do they
1850,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,bring with them. 44 Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this
1851,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best"
1852,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the"

1854,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1855,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he"
1856,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep"
1857,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he"
1858,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for"
1859,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself
1860,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become"
1861,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him
1862,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to"
1863,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your
1864,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that
1865,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your home over the"
1866,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,seas.’
1867,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1868,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the"
1869,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was
1870,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper
1871,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach."
1872,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1873,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the"
1874,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went"
1875,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"along by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the"
1876,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all"
1877,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father."
1878,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we"
1879,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"should come up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the"
1880,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our"
1881,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy"
1882,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,seals was most distressing45—who would go to bed with a sea monster if
1883,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"he could help it?—but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of"
1884,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under"
1885,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"each man’s nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of"
1886,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the seals.46
1887,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1888,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the"
1889,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the"
1890,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he"
1891,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,"
1892,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as"
1893,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and
1894,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed"
1895,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he
1896,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running"
1897,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and"
1898,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became"
1899,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"distressed, and said, ‘Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that"
1900,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my
1901,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,will? What do you want?’
1902,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1903,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘You know that yourself, old man,’ I answered, ‘you will gain nothing"
1904,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this
1905,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing all"
1906,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the"
1907,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail"
1908,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the sea so as to reach my home?’
1909,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1910,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Then,’ he said, ‘if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,"
1911,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before
1912,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your
1913,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the"
1914,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal"

1918,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,“I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long

1921,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we"

1923,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends
1924,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,when the days of his fighting were done.’
1925,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1926,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Son of Atreus,’ he answered, ‘why ask me? You had better not know"
1927,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard"
1928,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many"
1929,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"still remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished"
1930,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,during their return home. As for what happened on the field of
1931,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"battle—you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,"
1932,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove"
1933,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe"
1934,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva’s hatred he would have"
1935,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the"
1936,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"gods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when"
1937,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny"
1938,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained"
1939,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into"
1940,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was
1941,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,drowned.

1943,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when"
1944,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught"
1945,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his
1946,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but"
1947,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as"
1948,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"though he was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind"
1949,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed
1950,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own"

1952,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1953,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and"

1955,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the
1956,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he"
1957,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"went and told Aegisthus, who at once began to lay a plot for him. He"
1958,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on
1959,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"one side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a"
1960,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon, and"
1961,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all"
1962,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the"
1963,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles;
1964,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"not one of Agamemnon’s followers was left alive, nor yet one of"

1966,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1967,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat"
1968,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear
1969,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had"
1970,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea"
1971,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"said, ‘Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly;"
1972,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you

1976,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1977,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, ‘I know,"

1981,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
1982,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“‘The third man,’ he answered, ‘is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I can"

1984,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for"
1985,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own

1987,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There"
1988,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any"
1989,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail,"
1990,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly"
1991,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you"

1994,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the"
1995,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went"
1996,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was"
1997,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,"
1998,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put"
1999,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took"
2000,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again"
2001,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered"
2002,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased
2003,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"heaven’s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that his"
2004,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for"
2005,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the gods sent me a fair wind.
2006,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2007,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“And now for yourself—stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I"
2008,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a
2009,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice that
2010,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a

2012,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2013,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Son of Atreus,” replied Telemachus, “do not press me to stay longer; I"
2014,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I
2015,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish
2016,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos
2017,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any"
2018,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should be"
2019,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca, but"
2020,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat"
2021,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadow-sweet and"
2022,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas"
2023,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country"
2024,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"is more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that."
2025,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"48 None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and"
2026,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Ithaca least of all.”
2027,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2028,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus’s hand within his own. “What you
2029,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"say,” said he, “shows that you come of good family. I both can, and"
2030,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most"
2031,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by
2032,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Vulcan’s own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with"
2033,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a"
2034,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.
2035,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,I will make you a present of it.”
2036,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2037,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king’s house.
2038,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for"
2039,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the
2040,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,courts].49
2041,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2042,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a
2043,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses’ house, and were"
2044,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who"
2045,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were"
2046,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to
2047,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Antinous,"
2048,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2049,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?"
2050,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have"
2051,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet
2052,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him.”"
2053,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2054,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that"
2055,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was only
2056,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the"
2057,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"swineherd; so Antinous said, “When did he go? Tell me truly, and what"
2058,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own
2059,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"bondsmen—for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him"
2060,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he"
2061,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,take it without your leave?”
2062,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2063,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“I lent it him,” answered Noemon, “what else could I do when a man of"
2064,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him? I"
2065,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the
2066,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain—or some"
2067,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor"
2068,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for"
2069,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Pylos.”
2070,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2071,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Noemon then went back to his father’s house, but Antinous and"
2072,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Eurymachus were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing,"
2073,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,"
2074,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with
2075,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:"
2076,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2077,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we"
2078,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has"
2079,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving"
2080,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find
2081,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait"
2082,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the
2083,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,day that he set out to try and get news of his father.”
2084,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2085,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all"
2086,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,of them went inside the buildings.
2087,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2088,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were
2089,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the"
2090,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell"
2091,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:
2092,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the"
2093,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,maids to leave their master’s business and cook dinner for them? I wish
2094,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere"
2095,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of"
2096,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"my son’s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children,"
2097,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"how good Ulysses had been to them—never doing anything high-handed, nor"
2098,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they"
2099,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did"
2100,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"an unjust thing by anybody—which shows what bad hearts you have, and"
2101,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.”
2102,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2103,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then Medon said, “I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are"
2104,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,plotting something much more dreadful now—may heaven frustrate their
2105,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming
2106,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his"
2107,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,father.”
2108,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2109,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then Penelope’s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was"
2110,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no"
2111,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"utterance. At last, however, she said, “Why did my son leave me? What"
2112,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over
2113,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one
2114,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,behind him to keep up his name?”
2115,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2116,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“I do not know,” answered Medon, “whether some god set him on to it, or"
2117,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his
2118,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"father was dead, or alive and on his way home.”"
2119,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2120,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief."
2121,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"There were plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for"
2122,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor
2123,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old"
2124,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a"
2125,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"transport of sorrow she exclaimed,"
2126,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2127,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than"
2128,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and
2129,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and"
2130,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my"
2131,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having"
2132,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one"
2133,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though"
2134,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he
2135,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter"
2136,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him—one or"
2137,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"other. Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolius, who was given"
2138,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"me by my father on my marriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at"
2139,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"once and tell everything to Laertes, who may be able to hit on some"
2140,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who"
2141,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,are trying to exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses.”
2142,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2143,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, “You may kill me, Madam, or let"
2144,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the"
2145,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in"
2146,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I"
2147,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you"
2148,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you"
2149,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change"
2150,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to"
2151,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even"
2152,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has
2153,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the"
2154,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to"
2155,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that"
2156,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,lie far all round it.”
2157,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2158,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the"
2159,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and"
2160,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a
2161,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,basket and began praying to Minerva.
2162,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2163,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Hear me,” she cried, “Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If"
2164,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or
2165,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son"
2166,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,from the villainy of the suitors.”
2167,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2168,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;"
2169,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,"
2170,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,and one of them said:
2171,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2172,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,“The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.
2173,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.”
2174,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2175,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to"
2176,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"happen. Then Antinous said, “Comrades, let there be no loud talking,"
2177,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in
2178,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"silence, about which we are all of a mind.”"
2179,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2180,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"He then chose twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the"
2181,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and
2182,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted
2183,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,"
2184,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the
2185,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and"
2186,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,waited till night should fall.
2187,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2188,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and"
2189,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the"
2190,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen
2191,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into
2192,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion."
2193,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2194,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the"
2195,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,likeness of Penelope’s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had
2196,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the
2197,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came"
2198,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the
2199,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"door to, and hovered over her head saying,"
2200,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2201,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer"
2202,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will"
2203,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,yet come back to you.”
2204,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2205,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,"
2206,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I"
2207,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to"
2208,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?
2209,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good"
2210,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and"
2211,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship—a
2212,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going"
2213,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than
2214,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest"
2215,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"something should happen to him, either from the people among whom he"
2216,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against"
2217,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.”"
2218,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2219,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Then the vision said, “Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There"
2220,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand
2221,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and"
2222,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,who has sent me to bear you this message.”
2223,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2224,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"“Then,” said Penelope, “if you are a god or have been sent here by"
2225,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one—is he"
2226,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?”"
2227,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2228,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"And the vision said, “I shall not tell you for certain whether he is"
2229,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.”"
2230,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2231,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated
2232,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and
2233,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"comforted, so vivid had been her dream."
2234,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,
2235,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea,"
2236,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called
2237,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,"Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and"
2238,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.,there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then

2255,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2256,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in"

2260,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he"
2261,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where"
2262,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get"
2263,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"back to his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to"
2264,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to"
2265,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and"
2266,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.”"
2267,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2268,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied her father, “did you"
2269,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses"
2270,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to"
2271,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors"
2272,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.”
2273,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2274,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"When he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, “Mercury, you are"
2275,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor"
2276,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor
2277,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to"
2278,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"reach fertile Scheria,50 the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of"
2279,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of"
2280,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and will"
2281,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought
2282,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"back from Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home"
2283,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to
2284,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,his country and his friends.”
2285,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2286,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as"
2287,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with
2288,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand
2289,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he
2290,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped"
2291,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose"
2292,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and
2293,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He"
2294,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the"
2295,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"island which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land"
2296,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.
2297,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2298,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and"
2299,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal
2300,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden"
2301,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there
2302,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,"
2303,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests—owls, hawks, and"
2304,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,chattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine
2305,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of
2306,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,the cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut
2307,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"pretty close together, and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate"
2308,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. 51
2309,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so"
2310,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it
2311,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,sufficiently he went inside the cave.
2312,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2313,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Calypso knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, no matter"
2314,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,how far they live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was
2315,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears"
2316,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave"
2317,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Mercury a seat and said: “Why have you come to see me,"
2318,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you do not visit me often? Say"
2319,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be"
2320,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.”"
2321,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2322,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed
2323,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,"
2324,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,and then said:
2325,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2326,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I"
2327,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"have come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove"
2328,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all
2329,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer
2330,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none"
2331,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"of us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says"
2332,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,that you have here the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine
2333,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year
2334,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,after having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against
2335,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Minerva,52 who raised both wind and waves against them, so that all his"
2336,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"brave companions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and"
2337,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at once, for it is"
2338,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but"
2339,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.”
2340,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2341,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she"
2342,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"exclaimed, “ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous"
2343,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with"
2344,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"him in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion,"
2345,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed
2346,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and"
2347,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of"
2348,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now
2349,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor
2350,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his"
2351,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were"
2352,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island."
2353,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him"
2354,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"immortal, so that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot"
2355,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists"
2356,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"upon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him"
2357,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.
2358,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith, as"
2359,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.”
2360,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2361,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“Then send him away,” said Mercury, “or Jove will be angry with you and"
2362,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,punish you”.
2363,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2364,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"On this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,"
2365,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,for she had heard Jove’s message. She found him sitting upon the beach
2366,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness;"
2367,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with"
2368,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As"
2369,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore,"
2370,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the"
2371,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:
2372,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2373,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your"
2374,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will;
2375,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an"
2376,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread,"
2377,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will also give"
2378,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the"
2379,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"gods in heaven so will it—for they know more about these things, and"
2380,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,can settle them better than I can.”
2381,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2382,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there"
2383,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me
2384,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft.
2385,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Not even a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a
2386,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on
2387,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no
2388,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,mischief.”
2389,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2390,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know a
2391,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"great deal,” said she, “but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above"
2392,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and"
2393,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take—that I mean
2394,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I"
2395,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite
2396,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry"
2397,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,for you.”
2398,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2399,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and"
2400,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on"
2401,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and on till they came to Calypso’s cave, where Ulysses took the seat"
2402,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,that Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of
2403,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar
2404,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were"
2405,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,"
2406,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Calypso spoke, saying:"
2407,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2408,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own"
2409,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how"
2410,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own
2411,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and"
2412,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"let me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this"
2413,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet"
2414,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well-looking than she
2415,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in"
2416,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,beauty with an immortal.”
2417,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2418,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“Goddess,” replied Ulysses, “do not be angry with me about this. I am"
2419,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so
2420,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an"
2421,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"immortal. Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing"
2422,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and"
2423,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea
2424,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"already, so let this go with the rest.”"
2425,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2426,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into"
2427,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,the inner part of the cave and went to bed.
2428,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2429,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on"
2430,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer"
2431,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about"
2432,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to
2433,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great
2434,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and"
2435,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave
2436,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island"
2437,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached the"
2438,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"sky—very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the"
2439,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"water.53 Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew,"
2440,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished"
2441,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring"
2442,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back
2443,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers"
2444,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled
2445,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top"
2446,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a"
2447,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with"
2448,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw on"
2449,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some linen to make
2450,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with"
2451,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the"
2452,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,raft down into the water.
2453,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2454,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso"
2455,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean
2456,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another"
2457,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and"
2458,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm"
2459,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat"
2460,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed
2461,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes,"
2462,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and on the Bear—which men also call the wain, and which turns round and"
2463,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the"
2464,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,stream of Oceanus—for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left.
2465,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the"
2466,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian
2467,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon."
2468,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2469,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"But King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight"
2470,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could"
2471,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged"
2472,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"his head and muttered to himself, saying, “Good heavens, so the gods"
2473,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in
2474,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it"
2475,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen
2476,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done"
2477,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,with it.”
2478,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2479,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred"
2480,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till"
2481,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of"
2482,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all"
2483,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses’ heart"
2484,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"began to fail him. “Alas,” he said to himself in his dismay, “what ever"
2485,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should
2486,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How
2487,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"black is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds"
2488,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest
2489,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause
2490,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when the
2491,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for"
2492,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,then I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured
2493,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,my name; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”
2494,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2495,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft
2496,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go"
2497,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the"
2498,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a"
2499,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to rise"
2500,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him"
2501,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter
2502,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,"
2503,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he"
2504,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to"
2505,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn
2506,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though
2507,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the South, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and"
2508,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,shuttlecock with it at once.
2509,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2510,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called"
2511,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been"
2512,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great
2513,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like"
2514,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft."
2515,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2516,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“My poor good man,” said she, “why is Neptune so furiously angry with"
2517,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster"
2518,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I"
2519,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to"
2520,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the Phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my"
2521,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to"
2522,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off,"
2523,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go away again.”"
2524,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived
2525,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.
2526,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2527,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"But Ulysses did not know what to think. “Alas,” he said to himself in"
2528,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"his dismay, “this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring"
2529,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,me to ruin by advising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so
2530,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"at present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all"
2531,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do—I am
2532,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,sure it will be best—no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as
2533,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I"
2534,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than this.”
2535,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2536,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"While he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that"
2537,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,"
2538,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed
2539,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it
2540,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had
2541,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"given him, bound Ino’s veil under his arms, and plunged into the"
2542,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"sea—meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,"
2543,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, “There now, swim"
2544,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people. I
2545,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too
2546,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,lightly.” On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his
2547,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,palace is.
2548,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2549,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"But Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the"
2550,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good"
2551,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses
2552,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.
2553,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2554,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with"
2555,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when
2556,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so"
2557,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked
2558,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice"
2559,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,when their dear father begins to get better after having for a long
2560,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods"
2561,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land"
2562,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more"
2563,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he"
2564,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell"
2565,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped
2566,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter"
2567,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops."
2568,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2569,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Ulysses’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to"
2570,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"himself, “Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I"
2571,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast"
2572,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the"
2573,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for"
2574,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,want of foot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs
2575,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water—which would give me
2576,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of"
2577,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea"
2578,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of"
2579,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that"
2580,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Neptune is very angry with me.”
2581,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2582,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such
2583,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to
2584,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the
2585,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave
2586,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on"
2587,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,again and carried him back with it far into the sea—tearing his hands
2588,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its
2589,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"bed, and the stones come up along with it—even so did the rocks tear"
2590,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down"
2591,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,under the water.
2592,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2593,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his
2594,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"own destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him."
2595,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating"
2596,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"against the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the"
2597,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take"
2598,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a"
2599,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were no"
2600,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a"
2601,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"current, so he prayed inwardly and said:"
2602,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2603,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the"
2604,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost"
2605,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my"
2606,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your"
2607,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your"
2608,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,suppliant.”
2609,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2610,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"Then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm"
2611,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here"
2612,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"at last Ulysses’ knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had"
2613,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and"
2614,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither"
2615,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,"
2616,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"when he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off the"
2617,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt54 stream
2618,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"of the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that"
2619,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among"
2620,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth."
2621,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2622,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of"
2623,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through"
2624,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold"
2625,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,and damp may make an end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a keen
2626,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the"
2627,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may"
2628,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"escape the cold and have a good night’s rest, but some savage beast may"
2629,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,take advantage of me and devour me.”
2630,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,
2631,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one"
2632,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath
2633,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock—the one an ungrafted
2634,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,"
2635,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"could break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun’s rays"
2636,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow"
2637,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself a
2638,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying"
2639,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,about—enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard
2640,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down"
2641,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in"
2642,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the"
2643,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did"
2644,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep
2645,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,"upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of"
2646,CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.,his sorrows.

2657,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"So here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off"
2658,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,to the country and city of the Phaeacians—a people who used to live in
2659,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes"
2660,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"were stronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous"
2661,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other"
2662,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,"
2663,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to the
2664,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired of"
2665,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in"
2666,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,furtherance of the return of Ulysses.
2667,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2668,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there
2669,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King"
2670,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,"
2671,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made"
2672,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,folding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas’s
2673,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"daughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;"
2674,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a breath of wind, she"
2675,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,hovered over her head and said:
2676,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2677,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy"
2678,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are"
2679,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well"
2680,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend"
2681,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"you. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your"
2682,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a"
2683,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that"
2684,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best"
2685,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"young men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going"
2686,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a"
2687,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and"
2688,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"girdles, and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you"
2689,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town.”"
2690,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2691,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"When she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is"
2692,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and"
2693,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine
2694,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are"
2695,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess
2696,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,went when she had given instructions to the girl.
2697,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2698,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about her"
2699,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her
2700,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her"
2701,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her
2702,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"maids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was"
2703,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian"
2704,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:
2705,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2706,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want"
2707,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the
2708,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt"
2709,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons"
2710,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"at home, two of them married, while the other three are good looking"
2711,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go
2712,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"to a dance, and I have been thinking about all this.”"
2713,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2714,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,"
2715,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"but her father knew and said, “You shall have the mules, my love, and"
2716,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall"
2717,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your
2718,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,clothes.”
2719,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2720,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,"
2721,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the"
2722,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her
2723,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good
2724,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon,"
2725,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her"
2726,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and
2727,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on"
2728,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa"
2729,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her."
2730,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2731,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"When they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns,"
2732,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any
2733,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules"
2734,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the
2735,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the"
2736,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"water, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get"
2737,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they"
2738,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach"
2739,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"of shingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves"
2740,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream,"
2741,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done
2742,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to
2743,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes"
2744,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars
2745,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"or deer, and the wood nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take"
2746,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,their sport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter
2747,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"stand a full head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest"
2748,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her"
2749,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,handmaids.
2750,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2751,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the"
2752,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"clothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider how"
2753,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him
2754,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one"
2755,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they"
2756,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his"
2757,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.
2758,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2759,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“Alas,” said he to himself, “what kind of people have I come amongst?"
2760,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane? I"
2761,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of"
2762,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows"
2763,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me
2764,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.”
2765,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2766,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough"
2767,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some
2768,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and
2769,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of
2770,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even into"
2771,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"a well fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep—even such did"
2772,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as"
2773,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so"
2774,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that"
2775,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for"
2776,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She
2777,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"stood right in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should go up"
2778,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a"
2779,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some"
2780,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it best
2781,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence at
2782,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her in"
2783,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,honeyed and persuasive language.
2784,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2785,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“O queen,” he said, “I implore your aid—but tell me, are you a goddess"
2786,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I"
2787,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"can only conjecture that you are Jove’s daughter Diana, for your face"
2788,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a
2789,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and"
2790,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"mother—thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and"
2791,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself
2792,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose"
2793,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you to his own home."
2794,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am"
2795,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young
2796,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of
2797,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Apollo—for I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on"
2798,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet
2799,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I"
2800,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at
2801,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress;"
2802,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the
2803,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian
2804,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"island,55 and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure"
2805,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the
2806,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"end of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for me."
2807,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2808,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I"
2809,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to"
2810,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to"
2811,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart’s
2812,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"desire—husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing"
2813,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a
2814,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends"
2815,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.”"
2816,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2817,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"To this Nausicaa answered, “Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,"
2818,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives
2819,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"prosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what"
2820,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however,"
2821,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"that you have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes"
2822,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look
2823,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"for. I will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the name of"
2824,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in"
2825,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,whom the whole power of the state is vested.”
2826,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2827,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Then she called her maids and said, “Stay where you are, you girls. Can"
2828,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a
2829,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do
2830,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on"
2831,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"a land’s end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do"
2832,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way,"
2833,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"and we must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress"
2834,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"are under Jove’s protection, and will take what they can get and be"
2835,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink,"
2836,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the
2837,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,wind.”
2838,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2839,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another
2840,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told
2841,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the"
2842,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go and wash in the stream."
2843,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"But Ulysses said, “Young women, please to stand a little on one side"
2844,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,"
2845,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I
2846,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to
2847,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,strip56 before a number of good looking young women.”
2848,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2849,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses"
2850,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and
2851,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and"
2852,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and"
2853,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him
2854,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick"
2855,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;"
2856,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who
2857,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece
2858,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,of silver plate by gilding it—and his work is full of beauty. Then he
2859,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young"
2860,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said"
2861,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,to her maids:
2862,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2863,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who"
2864,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw
2865,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the"
2866,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just
2867,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go"
2868,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"away. However, give him something to eat and drink.”"
2869,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2870,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and"
2871,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind."
2872,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen"
2873,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she"
2874,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"took her seat, she called Ulysses:"
2875,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2876,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be going back to the town; I"
2877,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can"
2878,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians.
2879,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person."
2880,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"As long as we are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly"
2881,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,behind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.
2882,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Presently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find a"
2883,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side with"
2884,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the"
2885,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You"
2886,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it,"
2887,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in
2888,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"ship’s gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are"
2889,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of"
2890,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring"
2891,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which"
2892,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,they travel far over the sea.
2893,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2894,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,“I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against
2895,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low"
2896,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"fellow, if he met us, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger"
2897,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose
2898,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has
2899,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god"
2900,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is"
2901,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good
2902,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else,"
2903,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who
2904,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,are in love with her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark that
2905,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself"
2906,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"be scandalised at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with"
2907,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still"
2908,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"alive, and without having been married in the face of all the world."
2909,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2910,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help"
2911,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"you home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by"
2912,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow
2913,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about"
2914,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,as far from the town as a man’s voice will carry. Sit down there and
2915,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my
2916,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"father’s house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into"
2917,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will
2918,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you,"
2919,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house
2920,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer
2921,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"court, go right across the inner court till you come to my mother. You"
2922,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by
2923,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans back against one
2924,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her
2925,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"seat stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an"
2926,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother, and lay your"
2927,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her
2928,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"over, you may hope to see your own country again, no matter how distant"
2929,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,it may be.”
2930,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2931,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.
2932,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"The mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road."
2933,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were
2934,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with"
2935,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of
2936,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter"
2937,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,of Jove.
2938,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2939,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"“Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear"
2940,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking"
2941,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends"
2942,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,and be hospitably received by the Phaeacians.”
2943,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,
2944,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show"
2945,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,"herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who was"
2946,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.,still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.

3021,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3022,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to
3023,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Marathon59 and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered the"
3024,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous, and"
3025,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of
3026,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or"
3027,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the"
3028,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of"
3029,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver"
3030,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,and the hook of the door was of gold.
3031,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3032,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with"
3033,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the"
3034,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow
3035,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end"
3036,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the"
3037,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit
3038,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there"
3039,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands,"
3040,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table."
3041,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"There are60 fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always"
3042,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom,"
3043,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"or sit and spin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the"
3044,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it"
3045,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so"
3046,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"their women excel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them"
3047,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent."
3048,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3049,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about
3050,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful
3051,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"trees—pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are"
3052,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor"
3053,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so"
3054,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on
3055,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for"
3056,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,"
3057,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,the grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being
3058,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on"
3059,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again"
3060,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are
3061,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year
3062,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout"
3063,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the"
3064,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"outer court to the house itself, and the town’s people draw water from"
3065,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the"
3066,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,house of king Alcinous.
3067,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3068,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had"
3069,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the
3070,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the
3071,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Phaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always"
3072,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,did the last thing before going away for the night.61 He went straight
3073,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which"
3074,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King Alcinous;"
3075,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment"
3076,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every
3077,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there, but Ulysses"
3078,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,began at once with his petition.
3079,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3080,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“Queen Arete,” he exclaimed, “daughter of great Rhexenor, in my"

3085,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my
3086,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,friends.”
3087,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3088,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their
3089,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent"
3090,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty"
3091,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,addressed them thus:
3092,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3093,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“Alcinous,” said he, “it is not creditable to you that a stranger"
3094,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is
3095,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and"
3096,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix"
3097,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,some wine and water that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord
3098,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"of thunder, who takes all well disposed suppliants under his"
3099,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever"
3100,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,there may be in the house.”
3101,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3102,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from"
3103,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been"
3104,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then"
3105,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a
3106,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"silver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table"
3107,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many
3108,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"good things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank."
3109,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, “Pontonous, mix a cup of"
3110,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the
3111,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.”"
3112,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3113,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving"
3114,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and"
3115,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:"
3116,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3117,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You"
3118,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"have had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall"
3119,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial"
3120,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his
3121,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his"
3122,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how"
3123,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his
3124,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take the"
3125,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is
3126,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who has"
3127,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are
3128,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made"
3129,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them
3130,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,"
3131,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other
3132,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the"
3133,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.”62
3134,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3135,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Then Ulysses said: “Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into"
3136,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor"
3137,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted."
3138,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,"
3139,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,"
3140,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very"
3141,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man’s notice no matter how"
3142,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I"
3143,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and"
3144,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as"
3145,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to get home. I"
3146,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"shall be content to die if I may first once more behold my property, my"
3147,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house.”63"
3148,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3149,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he"
3150,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when
3151,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"they had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he"
3152,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving"
3153,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were
3154,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak, for"
3155,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was"
3156,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,"
3157,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like"
3158,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?"
3159,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?”
3160,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3161,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"And Ulysses answered, “It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate"
3162,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been"
3163,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island"
3164,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,far away in the sea which is called ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the
3165,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by"
3166,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,"
3167,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my"
3168,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave"
3169,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and"
3170,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last"
3171,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the
3172,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in
3173,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me
3174,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to"
3175,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,let her do so.
3176,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3177,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the"
3178,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at
3179,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free

3181,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she"
3182,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good
3183,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days"
3184,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught"
3185,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast—and glad
3186,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much
3187,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no"
3188,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly"
3189,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under"
3190,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current"
3191,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,brought me to your shores.
3192,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3193,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the"

3195,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place,"
3196,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then,"
3197,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was
3198,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I"
3199,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off"
3200,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the
3201,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke"
3202,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter’s maid servants playing"

3204,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition,"
3205,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,much more so than could be expected from so young a person—for young
3206,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,"
3207,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the
3208,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to"
3209,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"do so, I have told you the whole truth.”"
3210,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3211,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Then Alcinous said, “Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to"

3214,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3215,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“Pray do not scold her,” replied Ulysses; “she is not to blame. She did"

3217,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every

3219,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3220,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"“Stranger,” replied Alcinous, “I am not the kind of man to get angry"

3223,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my"

3229,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a"

3231,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of
3232,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place—and yet they did the whole"
3233,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and came back"
3234,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others,"
3235,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”
3236,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3237,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, “Father Jove, grant that"
3238,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable"
3239,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.”"
3240,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3241,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the
3242,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to"
3243,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to
3244,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when"
3245,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, “Rise, sir"
3246,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,” and glad indeed was"
3247,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,he to go to his rest.
3248,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,
3249,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;
3250,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.,"but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his"

3262,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous"
3263,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place"
3264,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat"
3265,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the"
3266,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"form of one of Alcinous’ servants, and went round the town in order to"
3267,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man by man, and"
3268,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"said, “Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the"
3269,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a
3270,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal

3272,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3273,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to"
3274,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one
3275,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified"
3276,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter"
3277,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as"
3278,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials"
3279,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"of skill to which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got"
3280,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"together, Alcinous spoke:"
3281,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3282,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,"
3283,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be,"
3284,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or
3285,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us
3286,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him;"
3287,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain"
3288,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into
3289,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with two and
3290,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your
3291,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to"
3292,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,prepare a feast.65 I will find you in everything. I am giving these
3293,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"instructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards"
3294,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining our"
3295,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have"
3296,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may
3297,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,choose to sing about.”
3298,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3299,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a"
3300,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to
3301,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew"
3302,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the"
3303,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due"
3304,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a"
3305,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house"
3306,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"of King Alcinous. The out houses,66 yards, and all the precincts were"
3307,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and
3308,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two"
3309,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent
3310,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,banquet.
3311,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3312,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had"
3313,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though"
3314,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of"
3315,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it"
3316,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his
3317,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He"
3318,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup"
3319,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.
3320,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3321,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before
3322,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse"
3323,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a"
3324,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel"
3325,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on"
3326,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,one another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad
3327,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo"
3328,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to
3329,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will
3330,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.
3331,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3332,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head"
3333,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that"
3334,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from
3335,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a"
3336,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus
3337,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again"
3338,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his
3339,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy"
3340,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and town"
3341,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the"
3342,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us"
3343,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so that our guest on his"
3344,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all
3345,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.”"
3346,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3347,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A"
3348,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"servant hung Demodocus’s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the"
3349,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief"
3350,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several
3351,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent"
3352,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,"
3353,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,"
3354,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus
3355,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking"
3356,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous,"
3357,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also."
3358,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3359,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the
3360,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew"
3361,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he
3362,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a
3363,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,couple of mules can plough in a fallow field.67 They then turned to the
3364,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man."
3365,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the"
3366,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous’s son
3367,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when"
3368,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"they had all been diverted with the games, “Let us ask the stranger"
3369,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully
3370,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"built; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,"
3371,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is"
3372,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong"
3373,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,he is.”
3374,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3375,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied Euryalus, “go up to your guest"
3376,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,and speak to him about it yourself.”
3377,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3378,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd
3379,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"and said to Ulysses, “I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for"
3380,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of
3381,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,them—and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is
3382,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,nothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the
3383,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try
3384,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your"
3385,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn"
3386,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"into the water, and the crew is found.”"
3387,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3388,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Ulysses answered, “Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind"
3389,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite
3390,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king"
3391,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,and people to further me on my return home.”
3392,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3393,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, “I gather, then, that you"
3394,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.
3395,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships
3396,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward"
3397,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the
3398,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,athlete about you.”
3399,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3400,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“For shame, Sir,” answered Ulysses, fiercely, “you are an insolent"
3401,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,fellow—so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in
3402,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but"
3403,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms
3404,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with
3405,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever"
3406,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but"
3407,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No
3408,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool."
3409,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are"
3410,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed,"
3411,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"so long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of"
3412,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have"
3413,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the
3414,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts"
3415,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,have stung me to the quick.”
3416,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3417,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,"
3418,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians"
3419,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"when disc-throwing among themselves.68 Then, swinging it back, he threw"
3420,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he"
3421,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it
3422,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been"
3423,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place"
3424,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"where it had fallen. “A blind man, Sir,” said she, “could easily tell"
3425,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,your mark by groping for it—it is so far ahead of any other. You may
3426,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can come near"
3427,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,to such a throw as yours.”
3428,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3429,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so"
3430,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"he began to speak more pleasantly. “Young men,” said he, “come up to"
3431,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even"
3432,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I"
3433,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what"
3434,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him"
3435,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one’s own personal"
3436,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a
3437,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"guest to challenge his host’s family at any game, especially when he is"
3438,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if
3439,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I want to"
3440,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at
3441,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent
3442,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my
3443,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"arrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me."
3444,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when
3445,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one
3446,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"else in the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the face of"
3447,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such"
3448,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men who could shoot against the"
3449,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his
3450,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged"
3451,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can
3452,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am
3453,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought"
3454,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still"
3455,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,weak.”

3460,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one
3461,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who"

3464,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary"

3477,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"their business to manage everything connected with the sports, so they"
3478,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.

3485,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus
3486,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"many presents, and defiled King Vulcan’s marriage bed, so the sun, who"
3487,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he"
3488,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief,"
3489,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains"
3490,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there"
3491,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,in that place.69 When he had finished his snare he went into his
3492,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs;
3493,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even
3494,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had
3495,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting"

3510,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had"
3511,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him"
3512,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the"
3513,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.
3514,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,

3518,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built,"

3520,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together
3521,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very
3522,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer than"

3526,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3527,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling

3531,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,"
3532,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:

3551,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,

3554,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?”
3555,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3556,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“Vulcan,” said Neptune, “if Mars goes away without paying his damages,"

3570,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no"

3573,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and"

3597,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"shall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of"
3598,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into

3600,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3601,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, “Good"

3610,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3611,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards

3615,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.
3616,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3617,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go, fetch the best chest we"

3620,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made
3621,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that

3626,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3627,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast
3628,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a"
3629,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became"
3630,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.71 Meanwhile
3631,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Arete brought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she"
3632,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the
3633,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from
3634,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:"

3639,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3640,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast
3641,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper
3642,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad
3643,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he"
3644,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had"
3645,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the
3646,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him"
3647,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests"
3648,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the
3649,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as"
3650,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"she saw him pass. “Farewell stranger,” said she, “do not forget me when"
3651,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom"

3653,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,

3658,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3659,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was"
3660,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the"
3661,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near"
3662,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean"
3663,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of
3664,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,"
3665,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,“Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for
3666,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;
3667,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse"

3669,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3670,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took"

3673,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, “Demodocus, there is no one in the"

3680,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who

3682,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.”
3683,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3684,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some

3686,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"hidden within the horse,73 were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan"

3688,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it,"
3689,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,and were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for
3690,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top
3691,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the"
3692,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering
3693,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the
3694,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which"
3695,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and
3696,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans
3697,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their"
3698,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and
3699,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus"
3700,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,to the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most
3701,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"furiously, nevertheless by Minerva’s help he was victorious."
3702,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3703,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his"
3704,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws
3705,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city
3706,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She"
3707,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for
3708,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back"
3709,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour and"
3710,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks—even so piteously did"
3711,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except"
3712,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs"
3713,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:"
3714,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3715,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease"
3716,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From"
3717,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our"
3718,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in
3719,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy"
3720,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should"
3721,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we"
3722,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"are making with so much good will are wholly in his honour, and any one"
3723,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to
3724,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.
3725,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3726,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor"
3727,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more
3728,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your
3729,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were"
3730,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is no one,"
3731,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for"
3732,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,people’s fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.
3733,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape"
3734,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have
3735,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations
3736,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are"
3737,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the
3738,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is"
3739,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"covered with mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being"
3740,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father
3741,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,say that Neptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the
3742,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he
3743,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted
3744,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"some one,74 and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my"
3745,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"father used to say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no"
3746,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,is a matter which he will decide for himself.
3747,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,
3748,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"“And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and"
3749,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples
3750,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"themselves, and of their cities—who were hostile, savage and"
3751,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"uncivilised, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us"
3752,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,also why you are made so unhappy on hearing about the return of the
3753,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,"Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them"
3754,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something
3755,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife’s when you
3756,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law—which are the nearest
3757,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some
3758,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,brave and kindly-natured comrade—for a good friend is as dear to a man
3759,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.,as his own brother?”

3771,AND CYCLOPES.,"And Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard"
3772,AND CYCLOPES.,with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or
3773,AND CYCLOPES.,"more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the"
3774,AND CYCLOPES.,"guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread"
3775,AND CYCLOPES.,"and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every"
3776,AND CYCLOPES.,"man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,"
3777,AND CYCLOPES.,"since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my"
3778,AND CYCLOPES.,"own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor"
3779,AND CYCLOPES.,"yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has"
3780,AND CYCLOPES.,been laid heavily upon me.
3781,AND CYCLOPES.,
3782,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and"
3783,AND CYCLOPES.,"one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though"
3784,AND CYCLOPES.,"I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,"
3785,AND CYCLOPES.,"renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame"
3786,AND CYCLOPES.,"ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain"
3787,AND CYCLOPES.,"called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a"
3788,AND CYCLOPES.,"group of islands very near to one another—Dulichium, Same, and the"
3789,AND CYCLOPES.,"wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest"
3790,AND CYCLOPES.,"up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it"
3791,AND CYCLOPES.,"towards dawn.75 It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my"
3792,AND CYCLOPES.,eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso
3793,AND CYCLOPES.,"kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also"
3794,AND CYCLOPES.,the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them
3795,AND CYCLOPES.,"persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country"
3796,AND CYCLOPES.,"and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign"
3797,AND CYCLOPES.,"country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it."
3798,AND CYCLOPES.,"Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by"
3799,AND CYCLOPES.,Jove’s will I met with on my return from Troy.
3800,AND CYCLOPES.,
3801,AND CYCLOPES.,"“When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is"
3802,AND CYCLOPES.,the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to
3803,AND CYCLOPES.,"the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided"
3804,AND CYCLOPES.,"equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I"
3805,AND CYCLOPES.,"then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very"
3806,AND CYCLOPES.,"foolishly would not obey me, so they staid there drinking much wine and"
3807,AND CYCLOPES.,killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the
3808,AND CYCLOPES.,Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were
3809,AND CYCLOPES.,"more in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of"
3810,AND CYCLOPES.,"war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the"
3811,AND CYCLOPES.,"occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as"
3812,AND CYCLOPES.,"leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so"
3813,AND CYCLOPES.,"that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships,"
3814,AND CYCLOPES.,and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.76 So long
3815,AND CYCLOPES.,"as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own against"
3816,AND CYCLOPES.,"them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went"
3817,AND CYCLOPES.,"down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the"
3818,AND CYCLOPES.,"better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so"
3819,AND CYCLOPES.,we got away with those that were left.
3820,AND CYCLOPES.,
3821,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have"
3822,AND CYCLOPES.,"escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we"
3823,AND CYCLOPES.,had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the
3824,AND CYCLOPES.,hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it
3825,AND CYCLOPES.,"blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and"
3826,AND CYCLOPES.,night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the
3827,AND CYCLOPES.,"gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took"
3828,AND CYCLOPES.,"them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the"
3829,AND CYCLOPES.,land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from
3830,AND CYCLOPES.,"toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again"
3831,AND CYCLOPES.,"raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and"
3832,AND CYCLOPES.,steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed
3833,AND CYCLOPES.,had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was
3834,AND CYCLOPES.,"doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of"
3835,AND CYCLOPES.,Cythera.
3836,AND CYCLOPES.,
3837,AND CYCLOPES.,“I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the
3838,AND CYCLOPES.,"sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who"
3839,AND CYCLOPES.,live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take
3840,AND CYCLOPES.,"in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near"
3841,AND CYCLOPES.,the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to
3842,AND CYCLOPES.,"see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a"
3843,AND CYCLOPES.,"third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the"
3844,AND CYCLOPES.,"Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus,"
3845,AND CYCLOPES.,which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about
3846,AND CYCLOPES.,"home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to"
3847,AND CYCLOPES.,"them, but were for staying and munching lotus77 with the Lotus-eaters"
3848,AND CYCLOPES.,"without thinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they"
3849,AND CYCLOPES.,wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under
3850,AND CYCLOPES.,"the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of"
3851,AND CYCLOPES.,"them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home, so"
3852,AND CYCLOPES.,they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.
3853,AND CYCLOPES.,
3854,AND CYCLOPES.,"“We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of"
3855,AND CYCLOPES.,the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor
3856,AND CYCLOPES.,"plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and"
3857,AND CYCLOPES.,"grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes"
3858,AND CYCLOPES.,yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no
3859,AND CYCLOPES.,"laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of"
3860,AND CYCLOPES.,"high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no"
3861,AND CYCLOPES.,account of their neighbours.
3862,AND CYCLOPES.,
3863,AND CYCLOPES.,“Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite
3864,AND CYCLOPES.,"close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run"
3865,AND CYCLOPES.,"with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never"
3866,AND CYCLOPES.,disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen—who as a rule will suffer so
3867,AND CYCLOPES.,"much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices—do not go there,"
3868,AND CYCLOPES.,"nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness"
3869,AND CYCLOPES.,"untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it"
3870,AND CYCLOPES.,"but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who"
3871,AND CYCLOPES.,"could make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city,"
3872,AND CYCLOPES.,or sail over the sea to one another’s country as people who have ships
3873,AND CYCLOPES.,"can do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island,78"
3874,AND CYCLOPES.,"for it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season."
3875,AND CYCLOPES.,"There are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea shore,"
3876,AND CYCLOPES.,well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there
3877,AND CYCLOPES.,"excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always"
3878,AND CYCLOPES.,"yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good"
3879,AND CYCLOPES.,"harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be"
3880,AND CYCLOPES.,"moored, but all one has to do is to beach one’s vessel and stay there"
3881,AND CYCLOPES.,till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of
3882,AND CYCLOPES.,"the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and"
3883,AND CYCLOPES.,there are poplars growing all round it.
3884,AND CYCLOPES.,
3885,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have"
3886,AND CYCLOPES.,"brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist"
3887,AND CYCLOPES.,hung all round our ships;79 the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds
3888,AND CYCLOPES.,"so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for it, nor"
3889,AND CYCLOPES.,were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before we
3890,AND CYCLOPES.,"found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached the"
3891,AND CYCLOPES.,"ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach"
3892,AND CYCLOPES.,till daybreak.
3893,AND CYCLOPES.,
3894,AND CYCLOPES.,"“When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired the"
3895,AND CYCLOPES.,"island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove’s daughters"
3896,AND CYCLOPES.,roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On
3897,AND CYCLOPES.,"this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and"
3898,AND CYCLOPES.,dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven
3899,AND CYCLOPES.,"sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got"
3900,AND CYCLOPES.,"nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to"
3901,AND CYCLOPES.,"the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty"
3902,AND CYCLOPES.,"of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we"
3903,AND CYCLOPES.,"sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we"
3904,AND CYCLOPES.,were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the
3905,AND CYCLOPES.,"Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires."
3906,AND CYCLOPES.,We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their
3907,AND CYCLOPES.,"sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we"
3908,AND CYCLOPES.,"camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council."
3909,AND CYCLOPES.,
3910,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘Stay here, my brave fellows,’ said I, ‘all the rest of you, while I"
3911,AND CYCLOPES.,go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they
3912,AND CYCLOPES.,"are uncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.’"
3913,AND CYCLOPES.,
3914,AND CYCLOPES.,"“I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers;"
3915,AND CYCLOPES.,so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When
3916,AND CYCLOPES.,"we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff"
3917,AND CYCLOPES.,"near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a"
3918,AND CYCLOPES.,"station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large"
3919,AND CYCLOPES.,"yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground"
3920,AND CYCLOPES.,and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster
3921,AND CYCLOPES.,who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have
3922,AND CYCLOPES.,"nothing to do with other people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was"
3923,AND CYCLOPES.,"a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling rather"
3924,AND CYCLOPES.,some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high
3925,AND CYCLOPES.,mountain.
3926,AND CYCLOPES.,
3927,AND CYCLOPES.,"“I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all"
3928,AND CYCLOPES.,"but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I"
3929,AND CYCLOPES.,also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by
3930,AND CYCLOPES.,"Maron, son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of"
3931,AND CYCLOPES.,"Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we"
3932,AND CYCLOPES.,"were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also"
3933,AND CYCLOPES.,his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great value—seven
3934,AND CYCLOPES.,"talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet"
3935,AND CYCLOPES.,"wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid"
3936,AND CYCLOPES.,"in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one"
3937,AND CYCLOPES.,housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of
3938,AND CYCLOPES.,"wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that"
3939,AND CYCLOPES.,it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with
3940,AND CYCLOPES.,"this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind"
3941,AND CYCLOPES.,misgave me that I might have to deal with some savage who would be of
3942,AND CYCLOPES.,"great strength, and would respect neither right nor law."
3943,AND CYCLOPES.,
3944,AND CYCLOPES.,"“We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went"
3945,AND CYCLOPES.,inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were
3946,AND CYCLOPES.,"loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could"
3947,AND CYCLOPES.,"hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets,"
3948,AND CYCLOPES.,then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones80
3949,AND CYCLOPES.,"all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels,"
3950,AND CYCLOPES.,"bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey."
3951,AND CYCLOPES.,"When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some"
3952,AND CYCLOPES.,"cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would then return,"
3953,AND CYCLOPES.,"drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with"
3954,AND CYCLOPES.,them. It would have been indeed better if we had done so but I would
3955,AND CYCLOPES.,"not listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope"
3956,AND CYCLOPES.,"that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men"
3957,AND CYCLOPES.,found him ill to deal with.
3958,AND CYCLOPES.,
3959,AND CYCLOPES.,"“We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of"
3960,AND CYCLOPES.,"them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his"
3961,AND CYCLOPES.,"sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood"
3962,AND CYCLOPES.,"to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise"
3963,AND CYCLOPES.,on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far
3964,AND CYCLOPES.,"end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as"
3965,AND CYCLOPES.,"the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams"
3966,AND CYCLOPES.,"and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the"
3967,AND CYCLOPES.,mouth of the cave—so huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled
3968,AND CYCLOPES.,waggons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the
3969,AND CYCLOPES.,"doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats,"
3970,AND CYCLOPES.,"all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He"
3971,AND CYCLOPES.,"curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the"
3972,AND CYCLOPES.,other half he poured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper.
3973,AND CYCLOPES.,"When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then"
3974,AND CYCLOPES.,"caught sight of us, whereon he said:"
3975,AND CYCLOPES.,
3976,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do"
3977,AND CYCLOPES.,"you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and"
3978,AND CYCLOPES.,every man’s hand against you?’
3979,AND CYCLOPES.,
3980,AND CYCLOPES.,“We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous
3981,AND CYCLOPES.,"form, but I managed to say, ‘We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,"
3982,AND CYCLOPES.,"but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far"
3983,AND CYCLOPES.,"out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who"
3984,AND CYCLOPES.,"has won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking so great"
3985,AND CYCLOPES.,a city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show
3986,AND CYCLOPES.,"us some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors"
3987,AND CYCLOPES.,"may reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven,"
3988,AND CYCLOPES.,"for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers"
3989,AND CYCLOPES.,"under his protection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and"
3990,AND CYCLOPES.,foreigners in distress.’
3991,AND CYCLOPES.,
3992,AND CYCLOPES.,"“To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, ‘Stranger,’ said he, ‘you"
3993,AND CYCLOPES.,"are a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,"
3994,AND CYCLOPES.,"indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do"
3995,AND CYCLOPES.,"not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so"
3996,AND CYCLOPES.,much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your
3997,AND CYCLOPES.,"companions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for"
3998,AND CYCLOPES.,doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
3999,AND CYCLOPES.,"on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the"
4000,AND CYCLOPES.,land?’
4001,AND CYCLOPES.,
4002,AND CYCLOPES.,"“He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in"
4003,AND CYCLOPES.,"that way, so I answered with a lie; ‘Neptune,’ said I, ‘sent my ship on"
4004,AND CYCLOPES.,"to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were"
4005,AND CYCLOPES.,"driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me"
4006,AND CYCLOPES.,escaped the jaws of death.’
4007,AND CYCLOPES.,
4008,AND CYCLOPES.,"“The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a"
4009,AND CYCLOPES.,sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down
4010,AND CYCLOPES.,upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed
4011,AND CYCLOPES.,"upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore"
4012,AND CYCLOPES.,them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a
4013,AND CYCLOPES.,"lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without"
4014,AND CYCLOPES.,"leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to"
4015,AND CYCLOPES.,"heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to"
4016,AND CYCLOPES.,"do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed"
4017,AND CYCLOPES.,"down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched"
4018,AND CYCLOPES.,"himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep."
4019,AND CYCLOPES.,"I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into"
4020,AND CYCLOPES.,"his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be"
4021,AND CYCLOPES.,"lost, for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster"
4022,AND CYCLOPES.,had put in front of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we
4023,AND CYCLOPES.,were till morning came.
4024,AND CYCLOPES.,
4025,AND CYCLOPES.,"“When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit"
4026,AND CYCLOPES.,"his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let"
4027,AND CYCLOPES.,each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his
4028,AND CYCLOPES.,"work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his"
4029,AND CYCLOPES.,"morning’s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone"
4030,AND CYCLOPES.,"away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back"
4031,AND CYCLOPES.,again—as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a
4032,AND CYCLOPES.,"quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried"
4033,AND CYCLOPES.,"‘Shoo, shoo,’ after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I"
4034,AND CYCLOPES.,was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself
4035,AND CYCLOPES.,with glory.
4036,AND CYCLOPES.,
4037,AND CYCLOPES.,“In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The
4038,AND CYCLOPES.,Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it
4039,AND CYCLOPES.,"was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a"
4040,AND CYCLOPES.,staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could only
4041,AND CYCLOPES.,compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large
4042,AND CYCLOPES.,"burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club"
4043,AND CYCLOPES.,and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and
4044,AND CYCLOPES.,"told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do,"
4045,AND CYCLOPES.,"and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire"
4046,AND CYCLOPES.,"to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was"
4047,AND CYCLOPES.,"lying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of"
4048,AND CYCLOPES.,them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the
4049,AND CYCLOPES.,monster’s eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom
4050,AND CYCLOPES.,"I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch"
4051,AND CYCLOPES.,"came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave—this"
4052,AND CYCLOPES.,"time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I"
4053,AND CYCLOPES.,"suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him"
4054,AND CYCLOPES.,to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the
4055,AND CYCLOPES.,"door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and"
4056,AND CYCLOPES.,then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all
4057,AND CYCLOPES.,"this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off"
4058,AND CYCLOPES.,them. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my
4059,AND CYCLOPES.,hands:
4060,AND CYCLOPES.,
4061,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘Look here, Cyclops,’ said I, you have been eating a great deal of"
4062,AND CYCLOPES.,"man’s flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what"
4063,AND CYCLOPES.,kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a
4064,AND CYCLOPES.,"drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and"
4065,AND CYCLOPES.,"further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and"
4066,AND CYCLOPES.,raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can
4067,AND CYCLOPES.,you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this
4068,AND CYCLOPES.,way?’
4069,AND CYCLOPES.,
4070,AND CYCLOPES.,“He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of
4071,AND CYCLOPES.,"the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. ‘Be so kind,’ he"
4072,AND CYCLOPES.,"said, ‘as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want"
4073,AND CYCLOPES.,to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even
4074,AND CYCLOPES.,"in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but"
4075,AND CYCLOPES.,this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.’
4076,AND CYCLOPES.,
4077,AND CYCLOPES.,"“I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,"
4078,AND CYCLOPES.,"and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I"
4079,AND CYCLOPES.,"saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as"
4080,AND CYCLOPES.,"I could: ‘Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,"
4081,AND CYCLOPES.,"therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what"
4082,AND CYCLOPES.,my father and mother and my friends have always called me.’
4083,AND CYCLOPES.,
4084,AND CYCLOPES.,"“But the cruel wretch said, ‘Then I will eat all Noman’s comrades"
4085,AND CYCLOPES.,"before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the"
4086,AND CYCLOPES.,present that I will make him.’
4087,AND CYCLOPES.,
4088,AND CYCLOPES.,"“As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground."
4089,AND CYCLOPES.,His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon
4090,AND CYCLOPES.,"him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets"
4091,AND CYCLOPES.,"of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk."
4092,AND CYCLOPES.,"Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and"
4093,AND CYCLOPES.,encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the
4094,AND CYCLOPES.,"wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the"
4095,AND CYCLOPES.,"fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had"
4096,AND CYCLOPES.,filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam
4097,AND CYCLOPES.,"into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept"
4098,AND CYCLOPES.,turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s
4099,AND CYCLOPES.,"plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on"
4100,AND CYCLOPES.,turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam
4101,AND CYCLOPES.,"into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked"
4102,AND CYCLOPES.,"it round and round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded"
4103,AND CYCLOPES.,"his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the"
4104,AND CYCLOPES.,fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to
4105,AND CYCLOPES.,temper it—for it is this that gives strength to the iron—and it makes a
4106,AND CYCLOPES.,"great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round the"
4107,AND CYCLOPES.,"beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We"
4108,AND CYCLOPES.,"ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore"
4109,AND CYCLOPES.,"from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain,"
4110,AND CYCLOPES.,shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak
4111,AND CYCLOPES.,headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave
4112,AND CYCLOPES.,"when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him."
4113,AND CYCLOPES.,
4114,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise,"
4115,AND CYCLOPES.,"breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able"
4116,AND CYCLOPES.,to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is
4117,AND CYCLOPES.,trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?’
4118,AND CYCLOPES.,
4119,AND CYCLOPES.,"“But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, ‘Noman is killing"
4120,AND CYCLOPES.,me by fraud; no man is killing me by force.’
4121,AND CYCLOPES.,
4122,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when"
4123,AND CYCLOPES.,"Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray"
4124,AND CYCLOPES.,to your father Neptune.’
4125,AND CYCLOPES.,
4126,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my"
4127,AND CYCLOPES.,"clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,"
4128,AND CYCLOPES.,felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the
4129,AND CYCLOPES.,door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it
4130,AND CYCLOPES.,"to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be"
4131,AND CYCLOPES.,foolish enough to attempt this.
4132,AND CYCLOPES.,
4133,AND CYCLOPES.,“As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own
4134,AND CYCLOPES.,"life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who"
4135,AND CYCLOPES.,"knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In"
4136,AND CYCLOPES.,the end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were
4137,AND CYCLOPES.,"well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them"
4138,AND CYCLOPES.,"noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the"
4139,AND CYCLOPES.,wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle
4140,AND CYCLOPES.,"sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that there were"
4141,AND CYCLOPES.,three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any
4142,AND CYCLOPES.,"of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in"
4143,AND CYCLOPES.,"the thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece,"
4144,AND CYCLOPES.,"face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time."
4145,AND CYCLOPES.,
4146,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but"
4147,AND CYCLOPES.,"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep"
4148,AND CYCLOPES.,"hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens"
4149,AND CYCLOPES.,"waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their"
4150,AND CYCLOPES.,master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they
4151,AND CYCLOPES.,"stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were"
4152,AND CYCLOPES.,"underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy"
4153,AND CYCLOPES.,"with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid"
4154,AND CYCLOPES.,hold of it and said:
4155,AND CYCLOPES.,
4156,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this"
4157,AND CYCLOPES.,"morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the"
4158,AND CYCLOPES.,"mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are"
4159,AND CYCLOPES.,the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is
4160,AND CYCLOPES.,"it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because"
4161,AND CYCLOPES.,that wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and
4162,AND CYCLOPES.,blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and
4163,AND CYCLOPES.,"talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash"
4164,AND CYCLOPES.,his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should
4165,AND CYCLOPES.,thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done
4166,AND CYCLOPES.,me.’
4167,AND CYCLOPES.,
4168,AND CYCLOPES.,"“As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way"
4169,AND CYCLOPES.,"out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram’s belly,"
4170,AND CYCLOPES.,"and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by"
4171,AND CYCLOPES.,constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them
4172,AND CYCLOPES.,down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who
4173,AND CYCLOPES.,"had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed."
4174,AND CYCLOPES.,"However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to"
4175,AND CYCLOPES.,"hush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once"
4176,AND CYCLOPES.,"and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote"
4177,AND CYCLOPES.,"the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my"
4178,AND CYCLOPES.,"voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops."
4179,AND CYCLOPES.,
4180,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your man"
4181,AND CYCLOPES.,"before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your"
4182,AND CYCLOPES.,visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would
4183,AND CYCLOPES.,"find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.’"
4184,AND CYCLOPES.,
4185,AND CYCLOPES.,"“He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from"
4186,AND CYCLOPES.,"off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it"
4187,AND CYCLOPES.,was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.81 The sea quaked
4188,AND CYCLOPES.,"as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us"
4189,AND CYCLOPES.,"back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I"
4190,AND CYCLOPES.,"snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men"
4191,AND CYCLOPES.,"by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they"
4192,AND CYCLOPES.,"laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I"
4193,AND CYCLOPES.,"was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of"
4194,AND CYCLOPES.,me to hold my tongue.
4195,AND CYCLOPES.,
4196,AND CYCLOPES.,"“‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to provoke this savage"
4197,AND CYCLOPES.,creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us
4198,AND CYCLOPES.,"back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of"
4199,AND CYCLOPES.,us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have
4200,AND CYCLOPES.,pounded our heads and our ship’s timbers into a jelly with the rugged
4201,AND CYCLOPES.,"rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.’"
4202,AND CYCLOPES.,
4203,AND CYCLOPES.,"“But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,"
4204,AND CYCLOPES.,"‘Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and"
4205,AND CYCLOPES.,"spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of"
4206,AND CYCLOPES.,"Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’"
4207,AND CYCLOPES.,
4208,AND CYCLOPES.,"“On this he groaned, and cried out, ‘Alas, alas, then the old prophecy"
4209,AND CYCLOPES.,"about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man"
4210,AND CYCLOPES.,"both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an"
4211,AND CYCLOPES.,"excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he"
4212,AND CYCLOPES.,"grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and"
4213,AND CYCLOPES.,said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all
4214,AND CYCLOPES.,"along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,"
4215,AND CYCLOPES.,"whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has"
4216,AND CYCLOPES.,managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come
4217,AND CYCLOPES.,"here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to show my"
4218,AND CYCLOPES.,"hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey—for"
4219,AND CYCLOPES.,"Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me,"
4220,AND CYCLOPES.,which no one else neither god nor man can do.’
4221,AND CYCLOPES.,
4222,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Then I said, ‘I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and"
4223,AND CYCLOPES.,"sending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more"
4224,AND CYCLOPES.,than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.’
4225,AND CYCLOPES.,
4226,AND CYCLOPES.,"“On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,"
4227,AND CYCLOPES.,"saying, ‘Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten"
4228,AND CYCLOPES.,"son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must"
4229,AND CYCLOPES.,"get back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight"
4230,AND CYCLOPES.,after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man’s ship
4231,AND CYCLOPES.,and find trouble in his house.’82
4232,AND CYCLOPES.,
4233,AND CYCLOPES.,"“Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a"
4234,AND CYCLOPES.,"rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with"
4235,AND CYCLOPES.,"prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a"
4236,AND CYCLOPES.,little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock
4237,AND CYCLOPES.,"fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on"
4238,AND CYCLOPES.,our way towards the shore of the island.
4239,AND CYCLOPES.,
4240,AND CYCLOPES.,“When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our
4241,AND CYCLOPES.,"ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our"
4242,AND CYCLOPES.,return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the
4243,AND CYCLOPES.,"sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops’ sheep, and divided them"
4244,AND CYCLOPES.,equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for
4245,AND CYCLOPES.,"the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share;"
4246,AND CYCLOPES.,"so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to"
4247,AND CYCLOPES.,"Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only"
4248,AND CYCLOPES.,thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.
4249,AND CYCLOPES.,
4250,AND CYCLOPES.,“Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted
4251,AND CYCLOPES.,"our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on"
4252,AND CYCLOPES.,"dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered"
4253,AND CYCLOPES.,"Dawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they"
4254,AND CYCLOPES.,took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed
4255,AND CYCLOPES.,"on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we"
4256,AND CYCLOPES.,had lost our comrades.

4267,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of
4268,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it"
4269,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","were) upon the sea,83 iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus"
4270,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the"
4271,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,"
4272,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long
4273,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats
4274,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their"
4275,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","well made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These"
4276,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",were the people among whom we had now come.
4277,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4278,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the
4279,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","time about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I"
4280,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must"
4281,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of"
4282,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","difficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a"
4283,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up"
4284,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","in the hide as in a sack—for Jove had made him captain over the winds,"
4285,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own
4286,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly
4287,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow
4288,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let
4289,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost through"
4290,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",our own folly.
4291,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4292,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native"
4293,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the
4294,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light"
4295,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we"
4296,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",might get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among
4297,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack"
4298,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","that Aeolus had given me. ‘Bless my heart,’ would one turn to his"
4299,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","neighbour, saying, ‘how this man gets honoured and makes friends to"
4300,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking
4301,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as far as he has,"
4302,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",come back with hands as empty as we set out with—and now Aeolus has
4303,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","given him ever so much more. Quick—let us see what it all is, and how"
4304,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.’
4305,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4306,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,"
4307,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried
4308,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and"
4309,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make
4310,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the"
4311,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our"
4312,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",fleet back to the Aeolian island.
4313,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4314,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by"
4315,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men
4316,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting"
4317,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the
4318,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, ‘Ulysses,"
4319,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",what brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great
4320,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was"
4321,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",that you wanted to go to.’
4322,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4323,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, ‘My men have undone"
4324,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this"
4325,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","mischief, for you can if you will.’"
4326,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4327,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their"
4328,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","father answered, ‘Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the"
4329,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","island; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you"
4330,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",come here as one abhorred of heaven.’ And with these words he sent me
4331,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",sorrowing from his door.
4332,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4333,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and
4334,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six"
4335,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the"
4336,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","rocky stronghold of Lamus—Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,"
4337,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]
4338,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last
4339,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",answers the salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep
4340,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a"
4341,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","shepherd, for they work much the same by night as they do by day.84"
4342,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4343,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep
4344,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","cliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took"
4345,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","all their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for"
4346,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","there was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always"
4347,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the"
4348,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but"
4349,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising"
4350,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find
4351,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",out what sort of people the inhabitants were.
4352,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4353,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the
4354,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till"
4355,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,"
4356,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going
4357,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and"
4358,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of"
4359,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","that country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she"
4360,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","directed them to her father’s house, but when they got there they found"
4361,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were"
4362,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",horrified at the sight of her.
4363,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4364,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,"
4365,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,"
4366,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","and began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other"
4367,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates
4368,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","raised a hue-and-cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians"
4369,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","sprang up from every quarter—ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at"
4370,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the"
4371,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the"
4372,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes"
4373,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",and took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men
4374,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and"
4375,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like
4376,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough"
4377,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at
4378,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",us. As for the others there was not one of them left.
4379,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4380,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had"
4381,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives—a"
4382,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes—for
4383,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus."
4384,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god"
4385,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","guided us thither, and having landed we lay there for two days and two"
4386,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day"
4387,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to"
4388,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or"
4389,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I
4390,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",espied the smoke of Circe’s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of
4391,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I"
4392,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","would not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it"
4393,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some"
4394,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",of them instead of going myself.
4395,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4396,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my
4397,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my"
4398,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the
4399,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him"
4400,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean
4401,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of"
4402,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and"
4403,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them
4404,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four"
4405,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my
4406,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag"
4407,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder,"
4408,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship,"
4409,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. ‘Look
4410,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","here my friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going to die so much before our"
4411,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have"
4412,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",got something to eat and drink on board.’ On this they uncovered their
4413,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a"
4414,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him"
4415,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner."
4416,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4417,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed
4418,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it"
4419,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,"
4420,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, ‘My friends,"
4421,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no
4422,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","idea where the sun either sets or rises,85 so that we do not even know"
4423,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and"
4424,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could"
4425,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it"
4426,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick"
4427,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",forest of trees.’
4428,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4429,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had"
4430,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre"
4431,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing"
4432,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a"
4433,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took"
4434,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot"
4435,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they"
4436,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","wept, as also did we who were left behind."
4437,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4438,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“When they reached Circe’s house they found it built of cut stones, on"
4439,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There"
4440,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor
4441,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged
4442,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great"
4443,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against"
4444,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",them.86 As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming
4445,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",from dinner—for they know he will bring them something—even so did
4446,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the"
4447,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.
4448,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","Presently they reached the gates of the goddess’s house, and as they"
4449,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as"
4450,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such"
4451,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites,"
4452,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, ‘There"
4453,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the
4454,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is"
4455,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",woman or goddess.’
4456,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4457,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them"
4458,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who"
4459,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",suspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her
4460,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with"
4461,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked"
4462,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","poisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she"
4463,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her"
4464,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and all, and they grunted"
4465,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they"
4466,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",remembered everything.
4467,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4468,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some"

4470,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with
4471,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so;
4472,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last"
4473,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the"

4475,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4476,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","“‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the"
4477,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place
4478,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a"
4479,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to"
4480,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and"
4481,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed

4485,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",
4486,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.",“Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also

4506,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will"
4507,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.","protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which"

4766,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on
4767,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind."
4768,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew"
4769,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,dead aft and staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well
4770,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship’s gear and let her
4771,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were
4772,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down"
4773,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the"
4774,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live"
4775,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce
4776,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but"
4777,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there
4778,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the"
4779,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.
4780,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4781,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword"
4782,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the
4783,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with"
4784,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying"
4785,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I"
4786,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best"
4787,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"I had, and would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly"
4788,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best"
4789,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the"
4790,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon"
4791,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus—brides,89 young bachelors, old"
4792,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"men worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave"
4793,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"men who had been killed in battle, with their armour still smirched"
4794,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench
4795,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with
4796,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the
4797,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and"
4798,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I
4799,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless
4800,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my
4801,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,questions.
4802,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4803,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had"
4804,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and
4805,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"unburied in Circe’s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was"
4806,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how"
4807,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have got here
4808,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,on foot quicker than I have with my ship.’
4809,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4810,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was all bad luck, and my own"
4811,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe’s
4812,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase"
4813,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul came down to"
4814,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have
4815,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"left behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father"
4816,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"who brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the"
4817,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when"
4818,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean
4819,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or"
4820,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,I may bring heaven’s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I
4821,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in"
4822,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave"
4823,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.’
4824,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"And I said, ‘My poor fellow, I will do all that you have asked of me.’"
4825,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4826,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the"
4827,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost"
4828,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the
4829,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her"
4830,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her,"
4831,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood"
4832,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.
4833,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4834,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre"
4835,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"in his hand. He knew me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why,"
4836,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the"
4837,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your
4838,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.’
4839,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4840,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of"

4843,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘You want to know,’ said he, ‘about your return home, but heaven will"

4845,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having"
4846,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you"
4847,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the
4848,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging"
4849,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these"
4850,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet"
4851,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn"
4852,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men. Even though
4853,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all"

4859,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“‘When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and
4860,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you"
4861,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"must take a well made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a"
4862,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even
4863,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and"
4864,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain

4866,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your
4867,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a

4875,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she"
4876,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own"
4877,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can"

4886,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and
4887,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"spoke fondly to me, saying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this"
4888,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the

4892,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to"

4898,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with

4900,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a"

4906,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"my son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she"

4908,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4909,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“My mother answered, ‘Your wife still remains in your house, but she is"
4910,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night
4911,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and"
4912,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain
4913,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a"
4914,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"magistrate,92 and how every one invites him; your father remains at his"
4915,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no
4916,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in
4917,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in"
4918,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the"
4919,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown any how upon the ground. He
4920,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"grieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers more"
4921,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise:
4922,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was"
4923,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out
4924,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the force"
4925,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,of my affection for you—this it was that was the death of me.’93
4926,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4927,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother’s ghost.
4928,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each"
4929,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and"
4930,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"being touched to the quick I said to her, ‘Mother, why do you not stay"
4931,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one
4932,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in
4933,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of
4934,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?’
4935,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4936,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not"
4937,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when"
4938,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,they are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;
4939,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has
4940,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"left the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,"
4941,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all"

4943,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4944,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the"
4945,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds
4946,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally."
4947,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that
4948,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at"
4949,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"once. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned"

4951,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4952,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of

4954,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she
4955,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her"
4956,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave"
4957,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,"
4958,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.
4959,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his"
4960,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods"
4961,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve"
4962,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold"
4963,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,your tongue and do not tell any one.’
4964,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4965,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and"
4966,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a"
4967,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in"
4968,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,"
4969,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer."
4970,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4971,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of"
4972,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two"
4973,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and"
4974,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not
4975,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,hold Thebes till they had walled it.
4976,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4977,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove"
4978,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"indomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,"
4979,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.
4980,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4981,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it
4982,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after
4983,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to"
4984,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the"
4985,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house of the
4986,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging"
4987,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother—to his ruing bitterly
4988,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,thereafter.
4989,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
4990,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given"
4991,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of
4992,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore"
4993,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously"
4994,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus"
4995,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from
4996,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man"
4997,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer,95 but"
4998,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle"
4999,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had
5000,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at"
5001,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then,"
5002,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,was the will of Jove accomplished.
5003,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5004,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons,"
5005,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these"
5006,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a"
5007,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again, each one"
5008,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"of them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of"
5009,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,gods.
5010,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5011,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of
5012,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short"
5013,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,"
5014,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they"
5015,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They"
5016,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount"
5017,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,"
5018,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if"
5019,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,"
5020,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or
5021,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,chin.
5022,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5023,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the"
5024,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but"
5025,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the"
5026,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.
5027,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5028,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own"
5029,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name
5030,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and"
5031,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew, or"
5032,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.”"
5033,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5034,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless"
5035,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:—
5036,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5037,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good"
5038,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"looking, and is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you"
5039,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"share in the distinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor"
5040,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great need,"
5041,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.”
5042,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5043,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,Then spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among
5044,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"them, “My friends,” said he, “what our august queen has just said to us"
5045,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it;"
5046,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King
5047,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,Alcinous.”
5048,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5049,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alcinous, “as surely as I still"
5050,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to
5051,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow,"
5052,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean
5053,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"to give him. As regards his escort it will be a matter for you all, and"
5054,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,mine above all others as the chief person among you.”
5055,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5056,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"And Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay"
5057,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded"
5058,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound"
5059,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"greatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own"
5060,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me"
5061,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,when I get back to Ithaca.”
5062,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5063,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Ulysses,” replied Alcinous, “not one of us who sees you has any idea"
5064,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people
5065,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see
5066,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"through them, but there is a style about your language which assures me"
5067,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own
5068,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practiced"
5069,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty"
5070,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"heroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished"
5071,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed"
5072,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"time—go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here"
5073,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell"
5074,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,us of your adventures.”
5075,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5076,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“Alcinous,” answered Ulysses, “there is a time for making speeches, and"
5077,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not"
5078,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades
5079,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their"
5080,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"return, through the treachery of a wicked woman."
5081,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5082,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the"
5083,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by"
5084,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as
5085,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"he had tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out"
5086,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor substance
5087,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you"
5088,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"come by your death,’ said I, ‘King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his"
5089,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies"
5090,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or
5091,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their wives"
5092,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,and city?’
5093,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5094,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘Ulysses,’ he answered, ‘noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea"
5095,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"in any storm of Neptune’s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the"
5096,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between"
5097,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most"
5098,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all"
5099,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding
5100,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You"
5101,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or"
5102,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the"
5103,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the"
5104,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I"
5105,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,heard Priam’s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her
5106,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body,"
5107,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped"
5108,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was
5109,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as"
5110,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy
5111,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by
5112,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought"
5113,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after—even on the good
5114,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,ones.’
5115,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5116,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“And I said, ‘In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to"
5117,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,last in the matter of their women’s counsels. See how many of us fell
5118,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"for Helen’s sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief"
5119,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,against you too during your absence.’
5120,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5121,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly"
5122,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,even with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly
5123,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about"
5124,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for"
5125,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We"
5126,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for
5127,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man’s estate,96"
5128,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one
5129,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"another as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not"
5130,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I"
5131,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,could do so. Furthermore I say—and lay my saying to your heart—do not
5132,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal a"
5133,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting women. But now"
5134,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?"
5135,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus—for"
5136,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,I presume that he is still living.’
5137,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5138,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your"
5139,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not"
5140,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,know.’
5141,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5142,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the
5143,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax"
5144,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son
5145,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,"
5146,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"saying, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you"
5147,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us"
5148,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?’"
5149,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5150,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the"
5151,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Achaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me"
5152,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"about my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get"
5153,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"near the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been"
5154,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so"
5155,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by"
5156,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you"
5157,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much"
5158,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,to heart even if you are dead.’
5159,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5160,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s favour; I would rather be a"
5161,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,paid servant in a poor man’s house and be above ground than king of
5162,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,kings among the dead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the
5163,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if"
5164,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,you have heard anything about my father Peleus—does he still rule among
5165,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and"
5166,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by
5167,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I"
5168,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy—could I but be as
5169,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"I then was and go even for a short time to my father’s house, any one"
5170,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.’
5171,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5172,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of Peleus, but I can tell you all"
5173,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros"
5174,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always
5175,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the"
5176,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the
5177,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but"
5178,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man"
5179,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,did he kill in battle—I cannot name every single one of those whom he
5180,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how"
5181,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the"
5182,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the
5183,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman’s bribes. Moreover, when"
5184,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had
5185,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the"
5186,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and"
5187,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every
5188,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he"
5189,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,was all the time urging me to break out from the horse—grasping the
5190,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury"
5191,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his
5192,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the
5193,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear"
5194,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.’"
5195,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5196,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a"
5197,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the"
5198,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,prowess of his son.
5199,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5200,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,“The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own
5201,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof—still
5202,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour
5203,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners"
5204,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in
5205,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all"
5206,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess."
5207,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,
5208,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"“When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, ‘Ajax, will you not"
5209,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that"

5267,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of"
5268,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88,"suffering, for I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me—a low"

5668,"THE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.","plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a"

5695,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5696,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered"
5697,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous"
5698,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,began to speak.
5699,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5700,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Ulysses,” said he, “now that you have reached my house I doubt not you"
5701,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,will get home without further misadventure no matter how much you have
5702,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here night after"
5703,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist"
5704,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought"
5705,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"gold,108 and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;"
5706,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a"
5707,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a
5708,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the
5709,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,burden of such a handsome present.”
5710,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5711,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his"
5712,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they"
5713,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.
5714,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the
5715,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,ship’s benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.
5716,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and he"
5717,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the lord of all.
5718,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after which"
5719,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a favourite with every one, sang"
5720,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as"
5721,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As"
5722,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen
5723,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he
5724,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"may go and get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry him, even so"
5725,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said to the"
5726,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly to King Alcinous:"
5727,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5728,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me"
5729,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart’s desire by giving"
5730,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may"
5731,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace
5732,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"among friends,109 and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction"
5733,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,to your wives and children;110 may heaven vouchsafe you every good
5734,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"grace, and may no evil thing come among your people.”"
5735,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5736,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and
5737,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken
5738,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"reasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, “Pontonous, mix"
5739,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"some wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to"
5740,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.”"
5741,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5742,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others
5743,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that
5744,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands"
5745,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,of queen Arete.
5746,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5747,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Farewell, queen,” said he, “henceforward and for ever, till age and"
5748,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"death, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take"
5749,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and"
5750,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,with king Alcinous.”
5751,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5752,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to"
5753,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some
5754,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"maidservants with him—one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to"
5755,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"carry his strong box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to"
5756,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"the water side the crew took these things and put them on board, with"
5757,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen
5758,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.
5759,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew"
5760,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone
5761,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea,"
5762,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.111"
5763,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5764,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies
5765,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it
5766,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water"
5767,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"seethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a"
5768,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus,"
5769,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"then, she cut her way through the water, carrying one who was as"
5770,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of"
5771,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves
5772,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,of the weary sea.
5773,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5774,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show,"
5775,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,the ship drew near to land.112 Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the
5776,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line"
5777,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of
5778,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship"
5779,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is
5780,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"a large olive tree, and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern"
5781,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads.113 There are mixing bowls
5782,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,"
5783,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of
5784,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,sea purple—very curious to see—and at all times there is water within
5785,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"it. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals can go down"
5786,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"into the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more"
5787,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken"
5788,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,by the gods.
5789,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5790,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the"
5791,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,place.114 She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length
5792,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"on to the shore;115 when, however, they had landed, the first thing"
5793,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,they did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the
5794,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took"
5795,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him
5796,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all
5797,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear"
5798,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,some passer by116 might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and
5799,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,then they made the best of their way home again.
5800,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5801,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already
5802,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"threatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. “Father Jove,” said"
5803,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"he, “I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods,"
5804,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show"
5805,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,such small regard for me. I said I would let Ulysses get home when he
5806,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home
5807,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it, and"
5808,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in a ship
5809,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more
5810,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever"
5811,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and"
5812,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,got home without misadventure.”
5813,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5814,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"And Jove answered, “What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking"
5815,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would be
5816,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As
5817,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and"
5818,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal"
5819,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.”"
5820,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5821,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“I should have done so at once,” replied Neptune, “if I were not"
5822,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"anxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I"
5823,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,should like to wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its
5824,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I
5825,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,should also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.”
5826,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5827,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very"
5828,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,"
5829,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will
5830,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the"
5831,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,mountain.”
5832,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5833,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the
5834,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Phaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid"
5835,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"way, had got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and"
5836,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground.
5837,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,After this he went away.
5838,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5839,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn"
5840,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"towards his neighbour, saying, “Bless my heart, who is it that can have"
5841,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could
5842,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,see the whole of her only a moment ago.”
5843,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5844,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous"
5845,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"said, “I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that"
5846,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the
5847,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from"
5848,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my"
5849,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"old father used to say, and now it is all coming true.117 Now therefore"
5850,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving
5851,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice"
5852,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not"
5853,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,bury our city under the high mountain.” When the people heard this they
5854,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,were afraid and got ready the bulls.
5855,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5856,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune,"
5857,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,standing round his altar; and at the same time118 Ulysses woke up once
5858,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know
5859,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"it again; moreover, Jove’s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so"
5860,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"that people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell"
5861,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and
5862,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,friends recognising him119 until he had taken his revenge upon the
5863,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to"
5864,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"him—the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the"
5865,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his"
5866,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and
5867,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,cried aloud despairingly.
5868,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5869,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner of people am I fallen? Are"
5870,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,they savage and uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put
5871,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over"
5872,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great
5873,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I
5874,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for"
5875,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and
5876,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me, and have"
5877,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to
5878,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants
5879,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do"
5880,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have"
5881,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,gone off with any of them.”
5882,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5883,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his"
5884,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about"
5885,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of"
5886,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him
5887,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a"
5888,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her
5889,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he
5890,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"saw her, and went straight up to her."
5891,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5892,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person whom I have met with in"
5893,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed"
5894,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your"
5895,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell"
5896,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I"
5897,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?”"
5898,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5899,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Minerva answered, “Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come"
5900,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is"
5901,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is"
5902,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bad"
5903,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also
5904,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and"
5905,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places"
5906,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known"
5907,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off from this"
5908,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Achaean country.”
5909,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5910,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own"
5911,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"country, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and"
5912,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.
5913,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5914,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and"
5915,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as
5916,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed"
5917,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him"
5918,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so
5919,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of
5920,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as
5921,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait"
5922,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"for him with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as"
5923,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark night and
5924,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but"
5925,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who"
5926,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"were Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis"
5927,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them."
5928,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we"
5929,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get
5930,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we"
5931,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were."
5932,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods out of"
5933,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand."
5934,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress"
5935,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,of mind.”
5936,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5937,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand."
5938,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, “He must be"
5939,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"indeed a shifty lying fellow,” said she, “who could surpass you in all"
5940,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare
5941,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not"
5942,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are"
5943,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"in your own country again? We will say no more, however, about this,"
5944,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are the most
5945,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for"
5946,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know
5947,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Jove’s daughter Minerva—me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch"
5948,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"over you in all your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so"
5949,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come here to talk things"
5950,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"over with you, and help you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians"
5951,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that await you in your
5952,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one, neither man nor"
5953,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, and put up with"
5954,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"every man’s insolence, without a word.”"
5955,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5956,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"And Ulysses answered, “A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you"
5957,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is
5958,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much,"
5959,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as"
5960,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we"
5961,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven"
5962,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and cannot"
5963,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had
5964,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I
5965,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me"
5966,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"into the town.120 And now, I beseech you in your father’s name, tell me"
5967,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in"
5968,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you
5969,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own"
5970,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,country?”
5971,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5972,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“You are always taking something of that sort in your head,” replied"
5973,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Minerva, “and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you"
5974,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning"
5975,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and
5976,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"children, but you do not seem to care about asking after them or"
5977,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who"
5978,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or"
5979,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near
5980,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back"
5981,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to"
5982,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded"
5983,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"his son.121 I will now, however, point out to you the lie of the land,"
5984,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old
5985,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of"
5986,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;122 here too is the
5987,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable
5988,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.”"
5989,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5990,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then
5991,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed"
5992,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs,"
5993,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"saying, “Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never"
5994,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving"
5995,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if"
5996,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Jove’s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to"
5997,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,manhood.”
5998,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
5999,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,” rejoined Minerva,"
6000,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where"
6001,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.”
6002,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6003,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding
6004,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and"
6005,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed
6006,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of"
6007,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and"
6008,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.
6009,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6010,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Ulysses,” said Minerva, “noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay"
6011,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your
6012,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents"
6013,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and"
6014,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"sending encouraging messages123 to every one of them, but meaning the"
6015,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,very opposite of all she says.”
6016,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6017,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"And Ulysses answered, “In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have"

6019,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best
6020,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as
6021,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,on the day when we loosed Troy’s fair diadem from her brow. Help me now
6022,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess,"
6023,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,will be with me.”
6024,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6025,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose sight of you when once"
6026,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"we set about it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring"
6027,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and
6028,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall
6029,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your
6030,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see
6031,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an"
6032,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the"
6033,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is
6034,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you,"
6035,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his
6036,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"pigs near the rock that is called Raven124 by the fountain Arethusa,"
6037,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their

6039,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon,"
6040,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still alive.”125
6041,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6042,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"“But why,” said Ulysses, “did you not tell him, for you knew all about"
6043,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship
6044,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,while others are eating up his estate?”
6045,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6046,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"Minerva answered, “Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be"
6047,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is"
6048,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with"
6049,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying
6050,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do"
6051,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are"
6052,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.”
6053,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6054,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with
6055,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over"
6056,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine"
6057,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him,"
6058,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave"
6059,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with"
6060,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to"
6061,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,sling it over his shoulder.
6062,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,
6063,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.,"When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess"

6073,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6074,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6075,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the"
6076,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the
6077,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was"
6078,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his
6079,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be"
6080,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"seen from far. He had made them spacious126 and fair to see, with a"
6081,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his
6082,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"master’s absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,"
6083,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"without saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them"
6084,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of
6085,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had"
6086,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,built twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were
6087,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the"
6088,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept"
6089,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had"
6090,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the"
6091,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"herdsman’s four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always"
6092,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of
6093,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,sandals127 from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding
6094,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to town"
6095,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might
6096,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.
6097,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6098,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at
6099,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of"
6100,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by"
6101,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,"
6102,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off
6103,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, “Old"
6104,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you"
6105,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough
6106,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in"
6107,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people
6108,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving"
6109,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"in some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill"
6110,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your"
6111,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,misfortunes.”
6112,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6113,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,On this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.
6114,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of"
6115,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,this he threw the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he
6116,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,"
6117,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"and said “May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your"
6118,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,heart’s desire in return for the kind way in which you have received
6119,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,me.”
6120,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6121,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Stranger, though a still"
6122,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult"
6123,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what"
6124,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"you can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have"
6125,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for"
6126,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,heaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good
6127,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"to me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of land, a good"
6128,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who"
6129,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as"
6130,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown
6131,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I"
6132,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"wish that Helen’s whole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been"
6133,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to
6134,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of"
6135,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,king Agamemnon.”
6136,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6137,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where
6138,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought
6139,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted"
6140,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before
6141,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over"
6142,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of
6143,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin."
6144,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6145,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish of servant’s pork. The fat"
6146,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or"
6147,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and"
6148,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,respect those who do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce
6149,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"freebooters who go raiding on other people’s land, and Jove gives them"
6150,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and got home"
6151,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but"
6152,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone;
6153,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their"
6154,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force,"
6155,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they"
6156,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his"
6157,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca"
6158,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men
6159,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of
6160,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also"
6161,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him"
6162,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even
6163,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the"
6164,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the
6165,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the"
6166,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have"
6167,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and sending it to them.”
6168,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6169,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"This was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously"
6170,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was"
6171,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,"
6172,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"filled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said"
6173,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"as he took it in his hands, “My friend, who was this master of yours"
6174,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell"
6175,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he
6176,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods"
6177,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled"
6178,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,much.”
6179,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6180,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Eumaeus answered, “Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will"
6181,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"get Ulysses’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in"
6182,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a"
6183,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my
6184,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes"
6185,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the"
6186,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old"
6187,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty"
6188,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to
6189,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones are"
6190,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone,"
6191,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and a bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go
6192,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"where I may I shall never find so good a master, not even if I were to"
6193,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,go home to my mother and father where I was bred and born. I do not so
6194,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"much care, however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like"
6195,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,to see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that
6196,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is
6197,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me"
6198,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.”
6199,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6200,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“My friend,” replied Ulysses, “you are very positive, and very hard of"
6201,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"belief about your master’s coming home again, nevertheless I will not"
6202,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything"
6203,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and"
6204,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take"
6205,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,"
6206,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove, by the"
6207,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now"
6208,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will"
6209,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the
6210,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,beginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who
6211,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,are ill treating his wife and son.”
6212,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6213,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Old man, you will neither"
6214,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink"
6215,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"your wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep"
6216,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks
6217,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I"
6218,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his"
6219,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his;
6220,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man,"
6221,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has"
6222,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get"
6223,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"news of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is"
6224,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"coming home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a"
6225,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"name in Ithaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be"
6226,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"taken, or else to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him"
6227,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"to protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also,"
6228,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"for I want to know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of"
6229,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew"
6230,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed to come—for"
6231,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,you cannot have come by land.”
6232,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6233,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"And Ulysses answered, “I will tell you all about it. If there were meat"
6234,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do"
6235,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily"
6236,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of
6237,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.
6238,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6239,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many"
6240,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had"
6241,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax"
6242,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among"
6243,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put"
6244,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock.
6245,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided"
6246,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a"
6247,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry"
6248,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the"
6249,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw"
6250,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to"
6251,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my
6252,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much
6253,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and spear all whom I"
6254,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm"
6255,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children. My"
6256,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things that most"
6257,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another
6258,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the"
6259,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on"
6260,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil"
6261,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later on."
6262,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6263,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but"
6264,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many"
6265,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"perished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to"
6266,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing"
6267,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked"
6268,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it
6269,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily
6270,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of"
6271,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it."
6272,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I"
6273,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice"
6274,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board"
6275,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were
6276,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had"
6277,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"no sickness on board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the"
6278,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river
6279,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay"
6280,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre
6281,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,from every point of vantage.
6282,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6283,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and"
6284,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their"
6285,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and"
6286,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the"
6287,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of
6288,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer"
6289,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians"
6290,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for"
6291,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus—and I wish I had died"
6292,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for"
6293,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand;
6294,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"then I went straight up to the king’s chariot, clasped his knees and"
6295,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot,"
6296,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and took me weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen
6297,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"spears and tried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me,"
6298,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who"
6299,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,punishes those who do evil.
6300,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6301,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,“I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the
6302,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on"
6303,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who"
6304,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me"
6305,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his"
6306,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the"
6307,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season
6308,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a"
6309,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but"
6310,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I
6311,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not"
6312,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,help it.
6313,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6314,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,“The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea
6315,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled"
6316,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could"
6317,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and"
6318,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts
6319,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and
6320,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea;
6321,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so
6322,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of"
6323,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"getting home again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship’s"
6324,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and"
6325,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the
6326,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian
6327,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably
6328,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,without charging me anything at all—for his son found me when I was
6329,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand,"
6330,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,took me to his father’s house and gave me clothes to wear.
6331,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6332,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had"
6333,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his"
6334,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought"
6335,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family
6336,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon."
6337,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s
6338,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"mind from the god’s high oak tree, and know whether after so long an"
6339,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the"
6340,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as"
6341,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,"
6342,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before
6343,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing"
6344,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge"
6345,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,of her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.
6346,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6347,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,“These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the
6348,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from"
6349,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the
6350,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered"
6351,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they"
6352,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a"
6353,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by"
6354,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn"
6355,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I"
6356,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near"
6357,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my
6358,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they"
6359,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"thought it was no further use and went back to their ship. The gods,"
6360,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"having hidden me thus easily, then took me to a good man’s door—for it"
6361,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,seems that I am not to die yet awhile.”
6362,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6363,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Poor unhappy stranger, I"
6364,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but"
6365,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to
6366,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this
6367,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of
6368,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him"
6369,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;
6370,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his
6371,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have"
6372,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,spirited him away we know not whither.
6373,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6374,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to"
6375,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news
6376,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those"
6377,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"who grieve over the king’s absence, and those who rejoice at it because"
6378,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I
6379,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was
6380,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till"
6381,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he"
6382,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships"
6383,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the
6384,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back"
6385,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has"
6386,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain"
6387,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but"
6388,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"only out of respect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and"
6389,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,pitying you.”
6390,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6391,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses answered, “I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have"
6392,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a"
6393,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master"
6394,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to"
6395,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,"
6396,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,"
6397,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.”
6398,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6399,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“And a pretty figure I should cut then,” replied Eumaeus, “both now and"
6400,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and"
6401,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good
6402,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,earnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will
6403,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.”"
6404,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6405,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the"
6406,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a"
6407,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But
6408,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Eumaeus called to his men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have,"
6409,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"that I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of"
6410,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs,"
6411,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,while others reap the fruit of our labour.”
6412,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6413,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine"
6414,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not"
6415,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first"
6416,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig’s face and throw them
6417,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might"
6418,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which
6419,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it,"
6420,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and"
6421,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the
6422,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers;"
6423,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits"
6424,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the
6425,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who"
6426,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"was a most equitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He"
6427,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of
6428,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt"
6429,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways
6430,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much"
6431,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"pleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well"
6432,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an"
6433,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,outcast like myself.”
6434,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6435,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and"
6436,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,"
6437,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.”"
6438,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6439,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt
6440,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put"
6441,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion."
6442,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man
6443,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"on his own account from among the Taphians during his master’s absence,"
6444,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either
6445,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good
6446,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"things that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and"
6447,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all"
6448,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,went to bed after having made a hearty supper.
6449,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6450,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It"
6451,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which"
6452,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in"
6453,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and"
6454,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"give it him, or make one of his men give him one. “Listen to me,” said"
6455,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"he, “Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell"
6456,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will
6457,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and
6458,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as"
6459,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong as"
6460,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the
6461,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it so."
6462,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath
6463,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood
6464,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,that grew about the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind
6465,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields"
6466,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"were coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts,"
6467,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders,"
6468,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I"
6469,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and"
6470,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted
6471,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and"
6472,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,he at once gave me his ear.
6473,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6474,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“‘Ulysses,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of me, for I have no"
6475,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my
6476,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"shirt, and I do not know what to do.’"
6477,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6478,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following"
6479,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,plan:
6480,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6481,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear you.’"
6482,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,Then he raised his head on his elbow.
6483,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6484,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"“‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We"
6485,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell
6486,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.’
6487,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6488,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,“On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running
6489,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough"
6490,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in
6491,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak"
6492,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but
6493,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.”
6494,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6495,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"And Eumaeus answered, “Old man, you have told us an excellent story,"
6496,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the
6497,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else"
6498,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow"
6499,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for"
6500,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has"
6501,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,only one. When Ulysses’ son comes home again he will give you both
6502,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.”"
6503,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6504,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some
6505,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here
6506,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak"
6507,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.
6508,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,
6509,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the"
6510,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to"
6511,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"go outside, and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his"
6512,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,property during his master’s absence. First he slung his sword over his
6513,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also
6514,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,"took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of"
6515,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the
6516,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from
6517,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.,the North wind.

6529,EUMAEUS.,
6530,EUMAEUS.,But Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses’ son
6531,EUMAEUS.,that he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping
6532,EUMAEUS.,"in the forecourt of Menelaus’s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but"
6533,EUMAEUS.,Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy
6534,EUMAEUS.,"father, so Minerva went close up to him and said:"
6535,EUMAEUS.,
6536,EUMAEUS.,"“Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,"
6537,EUMAEUS.,nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they
6538,EUMAEUS.,"will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a"
6539,EUMAEUS.,fool’s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to
6540,EUMAEUS.,find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father
6541,EUMAEUS.,"and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given"
6542,EUMAEUS.,"her more than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his"
6543,EUMAEUS.,wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the
6544,EUMAEUS.,"house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they always want to"
6545,EUMAEUS.,"do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never give"
6546,EUMAEUS.,"another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their"
6547,EUMAEUS.,"father either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and"
6548,EUMAEUS.,put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you
6549,EUMAEUS.,"have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let"
6550,EUMAEUS.,me tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The
6551,EUMAEUS.,chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait128
6552,EUMAEUS.,"between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean to kill you before you can"
6553,EUMAEUS.,reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely
6554,EUMAEUS.,that some of those who are now eating up your property will find a
6555,EUMAEUS.,"grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from"
6556,EUMAEUS.,the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send
6557,EUMAEUS.,you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on
6558,EUMAEUS.,"to the town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge"
6559,EUMAEUS.,"of your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him,"
6560,EUMAEUS.,"therefore, for the night, and then send him to Penelope to tell her"
6561,EUMAEUS.,that you have got back safe from Pylos.”
6562,EUMAEUS.,
6563,EUMAEUS.,Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with
6564,EUMAEUS.,"his heel to rouse him, and said, “Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the"
6565,EUMAEUS.,"horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.”129"
6566,EUMAEUS.,
6567,EUMAEUS.,"But Pisistratus said, “No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive"
6568,EUMAEUS.,in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought
6569,EUMAEUS.,his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good
6570,EUMAEUS.,bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never
6571,EUMAEUS.,forget a host who has shown him kindness.”
6572,EUMAEUS.,
6573,EUMAEUS.,"As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,"
6574,EUMAEUS.,"leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put"
6575,EUMAEUS.,"on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his"
6576,EUMAEUS.,"shoulders, and went out to meet him. “Menelaus,” said he, “let me go"
6577,EUMAEUS.,"back now to my own country, for I want to get home.”"
6578,EUMAEUS.,
6579,EUMAEUS.,"And Menelaus answered, “Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not"
6580,EUMAEUS.,detain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or
6581,EUMAEUS.,"too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a"
6582,EUMAEUS.,man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he
6583,EUMAEUS.,would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in
6584,EUMAEUS.,"the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I"
6585,EUMAEUS.,"can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have"
6586,EUMAEUS.,yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient
6587,EUMAEUS.,dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once
6588,EUMAEUS.,more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out
6589,EUMAEUS.,"on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a"
6590,EUMAEUS.,"tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will"
6591,EUMAEUS.,conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will send
6592,EUMAEUS.,"us away empty handed; every one will give us something—a bronze tripod,"
6593,EUMAEUS.,"a couple of mules, or a gold cup.”"
6594,EUMAEUS.,
6595,EUMAEUS.,"“Menelaus,” replied Telemachus, “I want to go home at once, for when I"
6596,EUMAEUS.,"came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while"
6597,EUMAEUS.,"looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that"
6598,EUMAEUS.,something valuable has been stolen during my absence.”
6599,EUMAEUS.,
6600,EUMAEUS.,When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to
6601,EUMAEUS.,prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At
6602,EUMAEUS.,"this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got"
6603,EUMAEUS.,"up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he"
6604,EUMAEUS.,"at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant store room,130"
6605,EUMAEUS.,"not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the"
6606,EUMAEUS.,"place where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double"
6607,EUMAEUS.,"cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing bowl."
6608,EUMAEUS.,Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses
6609,EUMAEUS.,"which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was"
6610,EUMAEUS.,largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered
6611,EUMAEUS.,"like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. 131 Then they all"
6612,EUMAEUS.,"came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus, and"
6613,EUMAEUS.,"Menelaus said, “Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring"
6614,EUMAEUS.,you safely home according to your desire. I will now present you with
6615,EUMAEUS.,the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a
6616,EUMAEUS.,"mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,"
6617,EUMAEUS.,and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a
6618,EUMAEUS.,present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on
6619,EUMAEUS.,my return home. I should like to give it to you.”
6620,EUMAEUS.,
6621,EUMAEUS.,"With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,"
6622,EUMAEUS.,while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before
6623,EUMAEUS.,him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.
6624,EUMAEUS.,
6625,EUMAEUS.,"“I too, my son,” said she, “have something for you as a keepsake from"
6626,EUMAEUS.,the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.
6627,EUMAEUS.,"Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go"
6628,EUMAEUS.,back rejoicing to your own country and to your home.”
6629,EUMAEUS.,
6630,EUMAEUS.,So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then
6631,EUMAEUS.,"Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as"
6632,EUMAEUS.,he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the
6633,EUMAEUS.,"house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought"
6634,EUMAEUS.,"them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver"
6635,EUMAEUS.,"basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside"
6636,EUMAEUS.,them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good
6637,EUMAEUS.,things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and
6638,EUMAEUS.,"gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine."
6639,EUMAEUS.,"Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,"
6640,EUMAEUS.,but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and
6641,EUMAEUS.,"Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot."
6642,EUMAEUS.,They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing
6643,EUMAEUS.,"gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came after them with a"
6644,EUMAEUS.,golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a
6645,EUMAEUS.,drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and
6646,EUMAEUS.,"pledged them, saying, “Farewell to both of you; see that you tell"
6647,EUMAEUS.,"Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any father"
6648,EUMAEUS.,could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.”
6649,EUMAEUS.,
6650,EUMAEUS.,"“We will be sure, sir,” answered Telemachus, “to tell him everything as"
6651,EUMAEUS.,soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses
6652,EUMAEUS.,"returned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very"
6653,EUMAEUS.,great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I
6654,EUMAEUS.,am taking with me.”
6655,EUMAEUS.,
6656,EUMAEUS.,As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand—an eagle with a
6657,EUMAEUS.,great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm
6658,EUMAEUS.,yard—and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It
6659,EUMAEUS.,came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front
6660,EUMAEUS.,"of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took"
6661,EUMAEUS.,"comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, “Tell me, Menelaus, has"
6662,EUMAEUS.,heaven sent this omen for us or for you?”
6663,EUMAEUS.,
6664,EUMAEUS.,Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to
6665,EUMAEUS.,"make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, “I will read this"
6666,EUMAEUS.,"matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it"
6667,EUMAEUS.,will come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred
6668,EUMAEUS.,"and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled"
6669,EUMAEUS.,"far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge—if indeed he is"
6670,EUMAEUS.,not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.”
6671,EUMAEUS.,
6672,EUMAEUS.,"“May Jove so grant it,” replied Telemachus, “if it should prove to be"
6673,EUMAEUS.,"so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at"
6674,EUMAEUS.,home.”
6675,EUMAEUS.,
6676,EUMAEUS.,As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed
6677,EUMAEUS.,through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon
6678,EUMAEUS.,their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and
6679,EUMAEUS.,"darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles"
6680,EUMAEUS.,"lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed"
6681,EUMAEUS.,"the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,"
6682,EUMAEUS.,"rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their"
6683,EUMAEUS.,places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and
6684,EUMAEUS.,under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed
6685,EUMAEUS.,his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came
6686,EUMAEUS.,"to Pylos, and then Telemachus said:"
6687,EUMAEUS.,
6688,EUMAEUS.,"“Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you."
6689,EUMAEUS.,"You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both"
6690,EUMAEUS.,"of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely;"
6691,EUMAEUS.,"do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I"
6692,EUMAEUS.,go to your father’s house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his
6693,EUMAEUS.,"good will towards me, and I must go home at once.”"
6694,EUMAEUS.,
6695,EUMAEUS.,"Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he"
6696,EUMAEUS.,"deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus’s"
6697,EUMAEUS.,beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then
6698,EUMAEUS.,"he said, “Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I"
6699,EUMAEUS.,"can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am"
6700,EUMAEUS.,"sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and"
6701,EUMAEUS.,he will not go back without you. But he will be very angry.”
6702,EUMAEUS.,
6703,EUMAEUS.,With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians
6704,EUMAEUS.,"and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and"
6705,EUMAEUS.,"gave his orders. “Now, my men,” said he, “get everything in order on"
6706,EUMAEUS.,"board the ship, and let us set out home.”"
6707,EUMAEUS.,
6708,EUMAEUS.,"Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as"
6709,EUMAEUS.,"Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in"
6710,EUMAEUS.,"the ship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a"
6711,EUMAEUS.,"seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was"
6712,EUMAEUS.,"descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;"
6713,EUMAEUS.,"he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by"
6714,EUMAEUS.,the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held
6715,EUMAEUS.,"them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the"
6716,EUMAEUS.,"house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of"
6717,EUMAEUS.,the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow
6718,EUMAEUS.,"that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped"
6719,EUMAEUS.,"with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the"
6720,EUMAEUS.,"wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his"
6721,EUMAEUS.,"brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where it was"
6722,EUMAEUS.,"ordained that he should reign over much people. There he married,"
6723,EUMAEUS.,"established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantius."
6724,EUMAEUS.,"Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, who was"
6725,EUMAEUS.,"dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live to old"
6726,EUMAEUS.,"age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His sons"
6727,EUMAEUS.,"were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was"
6728,EUMAEUS.,"father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off"
6729,EUMAEUS.,"Cleitus for his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals,"
6730,EUMAEUS.,but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now
6731,EUMAEUS.,that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to
6732,EUMAEUS.,"live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men."
6733,EUMAEUS.,
6734,EUMAEUS.,"His son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was"
6735,EUMAEUS.,"making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now"
6736,EUMAEUS.,"that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your"
6737,EUMAEUS.,"sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you"
6738,EUMAEUS.,also by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth
6739,EUMAEUS.,and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your
6740,EUMAEUS.,town and parents.”
6741,EUMAEUS.,
6742,EUMAEUS.,"Telemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and"
6743,EUMAEUS.,"my father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come"
6744,EUMAEUS.,to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew
6745,EUMAEUS.,"together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a"
6746,EUMAEUS.,long time.”
6747,EUMAEUS.,
6748,EUMAEUS.,"“I too,” answered Theoclymenus, “am an exile, for I have killed a man"
6749,EUMAEUS.,"of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they"
6750,EUMAEUS.,have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at
6751,EUMAEUS.,"their hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the"
6752,EUMAEUS.,"earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that"
6753,EUMAEUS.,"they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.”"
6754,EUMAEUS.,
6755,EUMAEUS.,"“I will not refuse you,” replied Telemachus, “if you wish to join us."
6756,EUMAEUS.,"Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according"
6757,EUMAEUS.,to what we have.”
6758,EUMAEUS.,
6759,EUMAEUS.,On this he received Theoclymenus’ spear and laid it down on the deck of
6760,EUMAEUS.,"the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus"
6761,EUMAEUS.,sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them
6762,EUMAEUS.,"to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set"
6763,EUMAEUS.,"the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast"
6764,EUMAEUS.,"with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of"
6765,EUMAEUS.,twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and
6766,EUMAEUS.,strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then
6767,EUMAEUS.,they passed by Crouni and Chalcis.
6768,EUMAEUS.,
6769,EUMAEUS.,Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel
6770,EUMAEUS.,"made a quick passage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans"
6771,EUMAEUS.,"rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,132 wondering"
6772,EUMAEUS.,within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken
6773,EUMAEUS.,prisoner.
6774,EUMAEUS.,
6775,EUMAEUS.,Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the
6776,EUMAEUS.,"hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and"
6777,EUMAEUS.,"drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he"
6778,EUMAEUS.,"would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the"
6779,EUMAEUS.,station or pack him off to the city; so he said:
6780,EUMAEUS.,
6781,EUMAEUS.,"“Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging"
6782,EUMAEUS.,"about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give"
6783,EUMAEUS.,"me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me"
6784,EUMAEUS.,and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs
6785,EUMAEUS.,"must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I"
6786,EUMAEUS.,should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her
6787,EUMAEUS.,husband to Queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and
6788,EUMAEUS.,see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should
6789,EUMAEUS.,soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and
6790,EUMAEUS.,believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace
6791,EUMAEUS.,"and good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would"
6792,EUMAEUS.,"make a more handy servant than I should—to put fresh wood on the fire,"
6793,EUMAEUS.,"chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that"
6794,EUMAEUS.,poor men have to do for their betters.”
6795,EUMAEUS.,
6796,EUMAEUS.,The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. “Heaven help
6797,EUMAEUS.,"me,” he exclaimed, “what ever can have put such a notion as that into"
6798,EUMAEUS.,your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a
6799,EUMAEUS.,"certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They"
6800,EUMAEUS.,would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their
6801,EUMAEUS.,"servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and"
6802,EUMAEUS.,"shirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables"
6803,EUMAEUS.,"are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay"
6804,EUMAEUS.,"where you are, then; you are not in anybody’s way; I do not mind your"
6805,EUMAEUS.,"being here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes"
6806,EUMAEUS.,home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you
6807,EUMAEUS.,want to go.”
6808,EUMAEUS.,
6809,EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses answered, “I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to"
6810,EUMAEUS.,"me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;"
6811,EUMAEUS.,"there is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men"
6812,EUMAEUS.,have once got low down in the world they will go through a great deal
6813,EUMAEUS.,"on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to"
6814,EUMAEUS.,"stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses’"
6815,EUMAEUS.,"mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he"
6816,EUMAEUS.,set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in
6817,EUMAEUS.,the house of Hades?”
6818,EUMAEUS.,
6819,EUMAEUS.,"“I will tell you all about them,” replied Eumaeus, “Laertes is still"
6820,EUMAEUS.,"living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house,"
6821,EUMAEUS.,"for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also"
6822,EUMAEUS.,"about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him"
6823,EUMAEUS.,more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end133 through
6824,EUMAEUS.,sorrow for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by
6825,EUMAEUS.,"me come to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,"
6826,EUMAEUS.,"though she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking"
6827,EUMAEUS.,"her how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,"
6828,EUMAEUS.,"the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she"
6829,EUMAEUS.,"made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they"
6830,EUMAEUS.,"sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me,"
6831,EUMAEUS.,my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for
6832,EUMAEUS.,"my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of"
6833,EUMAEUS.,me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to
6834,EUMAEUS.,prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat
6835,EUMAEUS.,"and drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who"
6836,EUMAEUS.,comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed out of my
6837,EUMAEUS.,"mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked people."
6838,EUMAEUS.,Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk with her;
6839,EUMAEUS.,"they like to have something to eat and drink at the house, and"
6840,EUMAEUS.,something too to take back with them into the country. This is what
6841,EUMAEUS.,will keep servants in a good humour.”
6842,EUMAEUS.,
6843,EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses answered, “Then you must have been a very little fellow,"
6844,EUMAEUS.,"Eumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents."
6845,EUMAEUS.,"Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother"
6846,EUMAEUS.,"lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you"
6847,EUMAEUS.,"were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for"
6848,EUMAEUS.,whatever your master gave them?”
6849,EUMAEUS.,
6850,EUMAEUS.,"“Stranger,” replied Eumaeus, “as regards your question: sit still, make"
6851,EUMAEUS.,"yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights are"
6852,EUMAEUS.,now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and
6853,EUMAEUS.,"sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time,"
6854,EUMAEUS.,too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes
6855,EUMAEUS.,to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master’s
6856,EUMAEUS.,pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We too will sit
6857,EUMAEUS.,"here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories"
6858,EUMAEUS.,"about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been"
6859,EUMAEUS.,"buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory"
6860,EUMAEUS.,"of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my"
6861,EUMAEUS.,tale is as follows:
6862,EUMAEUS.,
6863,EUMAEUS.,“You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above
6864,EUMAEUS.,"Ortygia,134 where the land begins to turn round and look in another"
6865,EUMAEUS.,"direction.135 It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,"
6866,EUMAEUS.,"with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine"
6867,EUMAEUS.,"and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any"
6868,EUMAEUS.,"sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them"
6869,EUMAEUS.,"with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole"
6870,EUMAEUS.,"country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus,"
6871,EUMAEUS.,"a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both."
6872,EUMAEUS.,
6873,EUMAEUS.,“Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for
6874,EUMAEUS.,the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted
6875,EUMAEUS.,with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in
6876,EUMAEUS.,"my father’s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant;"
6877,EUMAEUS.,these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near
6878,EUMAEUS.,"their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can"
6879,EUMAEUS.,"resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had"
6880,EUMAEUS.,"seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on this"
6881,EUMAEUS.,"she told him her father’s name. ‘I come from Sidon,’ said she, ‘and am"
6882,EUMAEUS.,"daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming"
6883,EUMAEUS.,"into the town from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took"
6884,EUMAEUS.,"me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who owns this"
6885,EUMAEUS.,"house, and he gave them their price for me.’"
6886,EUMAEUS.,
6887,EUMAEUS.,"“The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along"
6888,EUMAEUS.,with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?
6889,EUMAEUS.,They are both alive and are said to be well off.’
6890,EUMAEUS.,
6891,EUMAEUS.,"“‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you men will first swear me a"
6892,EUMAEUS.,solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.’
6893,EUMAEUS.,
6894,EUMAEUS.,"“They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their"
6895,EUMAEUS.,"oath the woman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the"
6896,EUMAEUS.,"street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one"
6897,EUMAEUS.,"should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something."
6898,EUMAEUS.,"He would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep"
6899,EUMAEUS.,"your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,"
6900,EUMAEUS.,and send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much gold
6901,EUMAEUS.,"as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that I can"
6902,EUMAEUS.,do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the
6903,EUMAEUS.,"house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry him"
6904,EUMAEUS.,"off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you"
6905,EUMAEUS.,take him and sell him in foreign parts.’
6906,EUMAEUS.,
6907,EUMAEUS.,“On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole
6908,EUMAEUS.,"year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,"
6909,EUMAEUS.,"and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the"
6910,EUMAEUS.,"woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father’s"
6911,EUMAEUS.,house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and
6912,EUMAEUS.,while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and
6913,EUMAEUS.,"bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went"
6914,EUMAEUS.,"back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the"
6915,EUMAEUS.,house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the
6916,EUMAEUS.,"cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in"
6917,EUMAEUS.,attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public
6918,EUMAEUS.,"assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the"
6919,EUMAEUS.,"bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun"
6920,EUMAEUS.,"was now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as"
6921,EUMAEUS.,"fast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship"
6922,EUMAEUS.,was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the
6923,EUMAEUS.,"sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did"
6924,EUMAEUS.,"we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the"
6925,EUMAEUS.,woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were
6926,EUMAEUS.,a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the
6927,EUMAEUS.,"seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the"
6928,EUMAEUS.,"winds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of"
6929,EUMAEUS.,"his chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon"
6930,EUMAEUS.,this country.”
6931,EUMAEUS.,
6932,EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses answered, “Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes"
6933,EUMAEUS.,"with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as"
6934,EUMAEUS.,"well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who"
6935,EUMAEUS.,sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good
6936,EUMAEUS.,"life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city.”"
6937,EUMAEUS.,
6938,EUMAEUS.,"Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for"
6939,EUMAEUS.,"sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his"
6940,EUMAEUS.,"crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast,"
6941,EUMAEUS.,and rowed the ship into the harbour.136 They cast out their mooring
6942,EUMAEUS.,"stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,"
6943,EUMAEUS.,"mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough"
6944,EUMAEUS.,"to eat and drink Telemachus said, “Take the ship on to the town, but"
6945,EUMAEUS.,"leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my"
6946,EUMAEUS.,"farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to"
6947,EUMAEUS.,"the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give"
6948,EUMAEUS.,you all a good dinner with meat and wine.” 137
6949,EUMAEUS.,
6950,EUMAEUS.,"Then Theoclymenus said, “And what, my dear young friend, is to become"
6951,EUMAEUS.,"of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or"
6952,EUMAEUS.,shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?”
6953,EUMAEUS.,
6954,EUMAEUS.,"“At any other time,” replied Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go"
6955,EUMAEUS.,"to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the"
6956,EUMAEUS.,"present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I"
6957,EUMAEUS.,"shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show"
6958,EUMAEUS.,"herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper"
6959,EUMAEUS.,"chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can"
6960,EUMAEUS.,"go to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held in the highest"
6961,EUMAEUS.,estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most
6962,EUMAEUS.,"persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and"
6963,EUMAEUS.,"trying to take Ulysses’ place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows"
6964,EUMAEUS.,whether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes
6965,EUMAEUS.,place.”
6966,EUMAEUS.,
6967,EUMAEUS.,"As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo’s"
6968,EUMAEUS.,"messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore"
6969,EUMAEUS.,"them off,138 fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship."
6970,EUMAEUS.,On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.
6971,EUMAEUS.,"“Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not fly on your right hand"
6972,EUMAEUS.,without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew
6973,EUMAEUS.,it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there
6974,EUMAEUS.,will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.”
6975,EUMAEUS.,
6976,EUMAEUS.,"“I wish it may prove so,” answered Telemachus. “If it does, I will show"
6977,EUMAEUS.,you so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet
6978,EUMAEUS.,you will congratulate you.”
6979,EUMAEUS.,
6980,EUMAEUS.,"Then he said to his friend Piraeus, “Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have"
6981,EUMAEUS.,throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who
6982,EUMAEUS.,have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to
6983,EUMAEUS.,your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.”
6984,EUMAEUS.,
6985,EUMAEUS.,"And Piraeus answered, “Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you"
6986,EUMAEUS.,"please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of"
6987,EUMAEUS.,hospitality.”
6988,EUMAEUS.,
6989,EUMAEUS.,"As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose"
6990,EUMAEUS.,"the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus"
6991,EUMAEUS.,"bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of"
6992,EUMAEUS.,sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the
6993,EUMAEUS.,"hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as"
6994,EUMAEUS.,"they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he"
6995,EUMAEUS.,"could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine"
6996,EUMAEUS.,"were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so"
6997,EUMAEUS.,devoted a servant to his master.

7007,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7008,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were
7009,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"were getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out"
7010,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but"
7011,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing"
7012,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:"
7013,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7014,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of"
7015,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and"
7016,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,not barking.”
7017,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7018,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the
7019,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"door. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing"
7020,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his"
7021,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not"
7022,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old"
7023,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"age, after ten years’ absence in a foreign country and after having"
7024,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"gone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as"
7025,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:"
7026,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7027,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I"
7028,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you
7029,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good"
7030,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into
7031,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town
7032,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the
7033,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,suitors are doing.”
7034,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7035,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“So be it, old friend,” answered Telemachus, “but I am come now because"
7036,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her old"
7037,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of"
7038,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.”
7039,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7040,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“She is still at the house,” replied Eumaeus, “grieving and breaking"
7041,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.”"
7042,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7043,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"As he spoke he took Telemachus’ spear, whereon he crossed the stone"
7044,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place
7045,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; “Sit down, stranger,” said"
7046,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"he, “I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay"
7047,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,it for me.”
7048,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7049,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Ulysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green"
7050,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for
7051,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Telemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of
7052,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"cold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he"
7053,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine
7054,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"also in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they"
7055,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon"
7056,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,"
7057,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring"
7058,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"him to Ithaca, and who were they?—for assuredly he did not come here by"
7059,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,land.”
7060,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7061,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “My son, I will tell you the"
7062,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great"
7063,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,"
7064,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"and has taken refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands."
7065,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Do whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your"
7066,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,suppliant.”
7067,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7068,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“I am very much distressed,” said Telemachus, “by what you have just"
7069,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,"
7070,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My
7071,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look
7072,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,after the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her
7073,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man"
7074,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most"
7075,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I"
7076,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,"
7077,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep
7078,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he"
7079,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go
7080,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat"
7081,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man
7082,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they will be too strong"
7083,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,for him.”
7084,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7085,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Then Ulysses said, “Sir, it is right that I should say something"
7086,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent
7087,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you
7088,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god"
7089,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers—for
7090,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"it is to these that a man may look for support, however great his"
7091,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present
7092,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would"
7093,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"rather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house"
7094,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and be the bane of every one of these men.139 If they were too many for
7095,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,me—I being single-handed—I would rather die fighting in my own house
7096,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly"
7097,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an"
7098,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose"
7099,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,for an end that shall never be accomplished.”
7100,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7101,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"And Telemachus answered, “I will tell you truly everything. There is no"
7102,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"enmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to"
7103,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove
7104,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius,"
7105,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses
7106,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of"
7107,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of
7108,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands,"
7109,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca"
7110,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my"
7111,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"mother, who will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor"
7112,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and"
7113,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"before long will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue,"
7114,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"however, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once"
7115,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it
7116,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"to herself alone, and then come back here without letting any one else"
7117,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"know, for there are many who are plotting mischief against me.”"
7118,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7119,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“I understand and heed you,” replied Eumaeus; “you need instruct me no"
7120,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"further, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let"
7121,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the
7122,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he"
7123,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me
7124,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten
7125,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits"
7126,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.”
7127,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7128,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“More’s the pity,” answered Telemachus, “I am sorry for him, but we"
7129,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything
7130,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of"
7131,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back again,"
7132,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send
7133,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it"
7134,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,from her.”
7135,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7136,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,"
7137,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched him"
7138,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a"
7139,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"woman—fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,"
7140,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and"
7141,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen"
7142,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not"
7143,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards."
7144,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon
7145,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the
7146,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,yards. Then she said to him:
7147,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7148,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your"
7149,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the"
7150,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be"
7151,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.”"
7152,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7153,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a
7154,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him
7155,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,"
7156,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she"
7157,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded
7158,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking"
7159,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,upon a god.
7160,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7161,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Stranger,” said he, “how suddenly you have changed from what you were"
7162,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not
7163,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If
7164,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings"
7165,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.”
7166,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7167,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"And Ulysses said, “I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am"
7168,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the"
7169,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,hands of lawless men.”
7170,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7171,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the"
7172,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could"
7173,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"not yet believe that it was his father, and said:"
7174,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7175,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes"
7176,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself
7177,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young"
7178,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"at a moment’s notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you were"
7179,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from"
7180,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,heaven.”
7181,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7182,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Ulysses answered, “Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably"
7183,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,astonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will
7184,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and"
7185,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.
7186,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who"
7187,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one"
7188,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with"
7189,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in
7190,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.”
7191,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7192,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father"
7193,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like
7194,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their
7195,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the"
7196,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not
7197,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"suddenly said, “In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you"
7198,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be—for you
7199,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,cannot have come by land?”
7200,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7201,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“I will tell you the truth, my son,” replied Ulysses. “It was the"
7202,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the"
7203,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took
7204,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after"
7205,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by"
7206,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"heaven’s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on"
7207,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our
7208,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their"
7209,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn"
7210,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the whole"
7211,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.”"
7212,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7213,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"To this Telemachus answered, “Father, I have always heard of your"
7214,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a"
7215,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot
7216,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor"
7217,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at"
7218,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have"
7219,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans
7220,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born."
7221,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve"
7222,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to"
7223,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some"
7224,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,one who would be willing to come and help us.”
7225,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7226,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Listen to me,” replied Ulysses, “and think whether Minerva and her"
7227,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some"
7228,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,one else as well.”
7229,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7230,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Those whom you have named,” answered Telemachus, “are a couple of good"
7231,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power"
7232,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,over both gods and men.”
7233,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7234,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“These two,” continued Ulysses, “will not keep long out of the fray,"
7235,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return"
7236,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"home early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before."
7237,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a
7238,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"miserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart"
7239,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of
7240,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently"
7241,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to
7242,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and"
7243,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"lay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I"
7244,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all"
7245,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.
7246,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say
7247,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as"
7248,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become"
7249,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you
7250,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that"
7251,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and
7252,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But"
7253,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of"
7254,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and
7255,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There is also another
7256,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let"
7257,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"no one know that Ulysses is within the house—neither Laertes, nor yet"
7258,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let"
7259,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"you and me exploit the women alone, and let us also make trial of some"
7260,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"other of the men servants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is"
7261,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,against us.”
7262,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7263,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Father,” replied Telemachus, “you will come to know me by and by, and"
7264,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,"
7265,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us."
7266,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms
7267,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your"
7268,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all
7269,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in"
7270,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later
7271,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.”"
7272,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7273,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought"
7274,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When
7275,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land;
7276,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"their servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all"
7277,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell
7278,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the"
7279,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.
7280,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the
7281,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the"
7282,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting
7283,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"women, “Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos”; but Eumaeus went"
7284,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"close up to Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden"
7285,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,him tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its
7286,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.
7287,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7288,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they went"
7289,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a"
7290,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the"
7291,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,first to speak.
7292,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7293,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“My friends,” said he, “this voyage of Telemachus’s is a very serious"
7294,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,"
7295,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send"
7296,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.”
7297,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7298,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw
7299,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and"
7300,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, “We need"
7301,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told"
7302,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her.”"
7303,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7304,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the
7305,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they"
7306,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any"
7307,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,"
7308,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,spoke first.
7309,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7310,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Good heavens,” said he, “see how the gods have saved this man from"
7311,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day
7312,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but"
7313,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and
7314,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us
7315,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our
7316,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"affair is never likely to come off while he is alive, for he is very"
7317,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make"
7318,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time
7319,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the"
7320,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people"
7321,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,will not like this when they come to know of it; we must see that they
7322,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try"
7323,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"and lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the"
7324,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"road hither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his"
7325,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,mother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not
7326,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"please you, and you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his father’s"
7327,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"property, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this"
7328,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"way, but must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and"
7329,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"she can marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it"
7330,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,is to win her.”
7331,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7332,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the
7333,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"son of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among"
7334,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of
7335,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope"
7336,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"than that of any of the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural"
7337,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"disposition. “My friends,” said he, speaking to them plainly and in all"
7338,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"honestly, “I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous"
7339,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of
7340,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to"
7341,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they"
7342,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands.”"
7343,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7344,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose"
7345,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"forthwith and went to the house of Ulysses, where they took their"
7346,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,accustomed seats.
7347,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7348,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She
7349,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had"
7350,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to
7351,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she"
7352,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister
7353,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:"
7354,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7355,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best"
7356,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are"
7357,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death of"
7358,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove"
7359,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another. Do
7360,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the
7361,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"people, who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian"
7362,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They
7363,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses"
7364,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"stayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour"
7365,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"his property without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his"
7366,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the"
7367,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,others also.”
7368,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7369,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"To this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, “Take heart, Queen Penelope"
7370,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters."
7371,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon"
7372,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"your son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the"
7373,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,earth. I say—and it shall surely be—that my spear shall be reddened
7374,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees, held"
7375,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands."
7376,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing"
7377,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him"
7378,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her, but in"
7379,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,reality he was plotting against Telemachus.
7380,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7381,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva
7382,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses
7383,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were"
7384,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to
7385,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and clad"
7386,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might"
7387,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope."
7388,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7389,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Telemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,”"
7390,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"said he. “What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or"
7391,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?”"
7392,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7393,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"“I did not think of asking about that,” replied Eumaeus, “when I was in"
7394,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I
7395,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he"
7396,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"was the first to tell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw"
7397,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury
7398,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of
7399,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the"
7400,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"suitors, but I cannot be sure.”"
7401,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7402,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"On hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus"
7403,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,could not see him.
7404,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,
7405,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"Then, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they"
7406,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"ate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As"
7407,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,"soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest"
7408,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.,and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

7422,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus"
7423,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for"
7424,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"he wanted to go into the city. “Old friend,” said he to the swineherd,"
7425,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will"
7426,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate
7427,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who"
7428,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my
7429,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry"
7430,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.”"
7431,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7432,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Then Ulysses said, “Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can"
7433,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"always do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give"
7434,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck
7435,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told
7436,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,"
7437,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly
7438,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you"

7440,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7441,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge"
7442,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,upon the suitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a
7443,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister"
7444,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"itself, and went inside."
7445,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7446,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting
7447,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to"
7448,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and"
7449,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like
7450,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She"
7451,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, “Light of my eyes,”"
7452,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are come home again; I"
7453,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your
7454,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining

7456,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7457,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Do not scold me, mother,” answered Telemachus, “nor vex me, seeing"

7462,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and"
7463,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,told Piraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for

7469,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7470,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand—not"
7471,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a"
7472,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went
7473,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths"
7474,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to sit with"
7475,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father’s house,"
7476,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and they made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Piraeus
7477,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town to the"
7478,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was"
7479,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"first to speak: “Telemachus,” said he, “I wish you would send some of"
7480,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,your women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.”
7481,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7482,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“We do not know, Piraeus,” answered Telemachus, “what may happen. If"
7483,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,"
7484,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people
7485,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"should get hold of them. If on the other hand I managed to kill them, I"
7486,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.”
7487,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7488,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got
7489,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the"
7490,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed"
7491,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at"
7492,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden
7493,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;"
7494,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them
7495,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.
7496,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the"
7497,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands"
7498,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had"
7499,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,enough to eat and drink Penelope said:
7500,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7501,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which"
7502,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out"
7503,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear"
7504,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether or no you had"
7505,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,been able to hear anything about the return of your father.”
7506,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7507,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“I will tell you then truth,” replied her son. “We went to Pylos and"
7508,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as"
7509,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long
7510,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from
7511,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He sent"
7512,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw"
7513,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in"
7514,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,heaven’s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that
7515,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon"
7516,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"he said, ‘So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind"
7517,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go"
7518,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he"
7519,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"comes back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and"
7520,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and"
7521,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with"
7522,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks"
7523,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"cheered him—if he is still such, and were to come near these suitors,"
7524,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your
7525,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the"
7526,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full. He said he"
7527,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the
7528,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"nymph Calypso, who was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his"
7529,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.’ This"
7530,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"was what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away;"
7531,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.”
7532,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7533,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said
7534,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,to her:
7535,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7536,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;"
7537,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide"
7538,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the"
7539,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,"
7540,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the"
7541,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds"
7542,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I
7543,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it.”"
7544,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7545,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true, you"
7546,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you
7547,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,shall congratulate you.”
7548,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7549,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or"
7550,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the
7551,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now"
7552,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the"
7553,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"town from all the country round, 140 with their shepherds as usual,"
7554,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon them"
7555,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"at table, said, “Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport,"
7556,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing,"
7557,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,at dinner time.”
7558,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7559,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the"
7560,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then"
7561,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and"
7562,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,well grown.141 Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime
7563,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the"
7564,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"swineherd said, “Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town"
7565,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have"
7566,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master"
7567,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one’s"
7568,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad"
7569,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it
7570,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,colder.”142
7571,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7572,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“I know, and understand you,” replied Ulysses; “you need say no more."
7573,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to"
7574,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.”"
7575,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7576,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,"
7577,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his"
7578,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"liking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs"
7579,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his
7580,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"master followed after, looking like some broken down old tramp as he"
7581,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had"
7582,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached"
7583,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,the fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been
7584,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a grove of"
7585,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear"
7586,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"cold water came down to it from a rock high up,143 while above the"
7587,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used"
7588,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was
7589,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors’"
7590,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus and"
7591,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which"
7592,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,made Ulysses very angry.
7593,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7594,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“There you go,” cried he, “and a precious pair you are. See how heaven"
7595,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master"
7596,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any"
7597,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won
7598,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his"
7599,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"shoulders against every man’s door post, and begging, not for swords"
7600,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"and cauldrons144 like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth"
7601,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he"
7602,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the"
7603,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but"
7604,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he
7605,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his"
7606,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"insatiable belly. I say, therefore—and it shall surely be—if he goes"
7607,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,near Ulysses’ house he will get his head broken by the stools they will
7608,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"fling at him, till they turn him out.”"
7609,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7610,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure"
7611,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path."
7612,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him
7613,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he"
7614,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the"
7615,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his"
7616,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,hands and praying to heaven as he did so.
7617,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7618,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Fountain nymphs,” he cried, “children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned"
7619,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my"
7620,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to the
7621,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting
7622,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,people—gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin
7623,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,through bad shepherding.”
7624,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7625,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Then Melanthius the goatherd answered, “You ill conditioned cur, what"
7626,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship
7627,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the"
7628,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike
7629,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I"
7630,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,am that Ulysses will never come home again.”
7631,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7632,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"With this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went"
7633,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he got
7634,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite
7635,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Eurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants"
7636,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread"
7637,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came
7638,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was"
7639,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the
7640,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"swineherd’s hand, and said:"
7641,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7642,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far"
7643,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"you go, you will find few like it. One building keeps following on"
7644,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round
7645,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be"
7646,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there"
7647,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast"
7648,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along"
7649,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,with feasting.”
7650,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7651,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Then Eumaeus said, “You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally"
7652,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside
7653,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you"
7654,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may"
7655,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"see you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider"
7656,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,this matter I pray you.”
7657,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7658,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"And Ulysses answered, “I understand and heed. Go in first and leave me"
7659,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things
7660,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that
7661,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot"
7662,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives
7663,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted
7664,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.”"
7665,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7666,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his"
7667,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred"
7668,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him."
7669,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went
7670,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone"
7671,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in
7672,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to
7673,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw
7674,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he"
7675,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,could not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the
7676,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"other side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus"
7677,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"seeing it, and said:"
7678,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7679,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:"
7680,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he"
7681,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept"
7682,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,merely for show?”
7683,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7684,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“This hound,” answered Eumaeus, “belonged to him who has died in a far"
7685,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would"
7686,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the
7687,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But
7688,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and"
7689,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their
7690,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"master’s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness"
7691,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,out of a man when he makes a slave of him.”
7692,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7693,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the
7694,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master."
7695,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7696,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him"
7697,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying
7698,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he
7699,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"picked it up, brought it to Telemachus’s table, and sat down opposite"
7700,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from"
7701,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,the bread-basket.
7702,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7703,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor"
7704,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in"
7705,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors
7706,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"leading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post"
7707,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed, and had made"
7708,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the
7709,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and"
7710,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"said to Eumaeus, “Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the"
7711,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be"
7712,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,shamefaced.”
7713,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7714,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"So Eumaeus went up to him and said, “Stranger, Telemachus sends you"
7715,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for"
7716,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,beggars must not be shamefaced.”
7717,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7718,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Ulysses answered, “May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and"
7719,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,fulfil the desire of his heart.”
7720,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7721,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it"
7722,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the
7723,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The"
7724,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and"
7725,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that"
7726,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the"
7727,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of
7728,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right,"
7729,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar.
7730,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another"
7731,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius
7732,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"said, “Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about"
7733,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I"
7734,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.”"
7735,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7736,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. “You precious idiot,” he"
7737,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"cried, “what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps"
7738,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think
7739,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master’s
7740,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,property—and must you needs bring this man as well?”
7741,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7742,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"And Eumaeus answered, “Antinous, your birth is good but your words"
7743,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to
7744,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who"
7745,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a"
7746,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,bard who can charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the
7747,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry"
7748,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,him. You are always harder on Ulysses’ servants than any of the other
7749,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as"
7750,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,Telemachus and Penelope are alive and here.”
7751,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7752,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"But Telemachus said, “Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the"
7753,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.”"
7754,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7755,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Then turning to Antinous he said, “Antinous, you take as much care of"
7756,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this
7757,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and
7758,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind
7759,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you"
7760,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself"
7761,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,than of giving them to other people.”
7762,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7763,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“What do you mean, Telemachus,” replied Antinous, “by this swaggering"
7764,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would"
7765,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,not come here again for another three months.”
7766,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7767,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from
7768,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but"
7769,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with"
7770,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold"
7771,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to"
7772,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,Antinous and said:
7773,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7774,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you"
7775,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be"
7776,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too"
7777,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I"
7778,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor"
7779,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things"
7780,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it"
7781,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving
7782,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I
7783,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"stationed my ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them"
7784,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"and keep guard over them, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from"
7785,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,every point of vantage.
7786,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7787,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and"
7788,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their"
7789,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,"
7790,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till"
7791,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam"
7792,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no"
7793,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The"
7794,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced"
7795,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,"
7796,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in"
7797,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.”
7798,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7799,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Then Antinous said, “What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague"
7800,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,145 or I"
7801,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and
7802,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you"
7803,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free"
7804,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,with other people’s property when there is plenty of it.”
7805,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7806,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"On this Ulysses began to move off, and said, “Your looks, my fine sir,"
7807,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would
7808,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in"
7809,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"another man’s, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you"
7810,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,to give him even a piece of bread.”
7811,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7812,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, “You shall"
7813,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,pay for this before you get clear of the court.” With these words he
7814,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near"
7815,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not
7816,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his"
7817,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying"
7818,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,his well filled wallet at his feet.
7819,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7820,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Listen to me,” he cried, “you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may"
7821,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets
7822,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and"
7823,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,"
7824,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have"
7825,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to"
7826,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,a bad end before his marriage.”
7827,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7828,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off"
7829,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"elsewhere,” shouted Antinous. “If you say more I will have you dragged"
7830,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you"
7831,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,alive.”
7832,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7833,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young"
7834,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"men said, “Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a"
7835,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some
7836,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,god—and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as
7837,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"people from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do"
7838,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,amiss and who righteously.”146
7839,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7840,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Thus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile"
7841,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his
7842,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence"
7843,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and brooded on his revenge.
7844,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7845,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the
7846,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"banqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, “Would that Apollo"
7847,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"would so strike you, Antinous,” and her waiting woman Eurynome"
7848,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"answered, “If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would"
7849,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"ever again see the sun rise.” Then Penelope said, “Nurse,147 I hate"
7850,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"every single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I"
7851,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,hate Antinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate
7852,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else
7853,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"has given him something to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him"
7854,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.”
7855,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7856,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the"
7857,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the
7858,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"swineherd and said, “Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I"
7859,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled
7860,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.”"
7861,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7862,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “If these Achaeans, Madam,"
7863,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his"
7864,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,"
7865,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,"
7866,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had
7867,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips"
7868,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat"
7869,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship
7870,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete"
7871,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"where the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither"
7872,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has
7873,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the
7874,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.”"
7875,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7876,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Call him here, then,” said Penelope, “that I too may hear his story."
7877,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they"
7878,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain"
7879,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, while"
7880,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,"
7881,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a"
7882,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such
7883,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to"
7884,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"come again, he and his son would soon have their revenge.”"
7885,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7886,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house
7887,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to"
7888,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Eumaeus, “Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed"
7889,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are
7890,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore"
7891,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the"
7892,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of
7893,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,good wear.”
7894,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7895,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"When Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, “Father"
7896,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you;"
7897,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her"
7898,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the"
7899,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things"
7900,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that"
7901,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give"
7902,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,that will.”
7903,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7904,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“I will tell Penelope,” answered Ulysses, “nothing but what is strictly"
7905,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him in"
7906,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel"
7907,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now,"
7908,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man"
7909,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any"
7910,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait"
7911,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my"
7912,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"clothes are worn very thin—you know they are, for you have seen them"
7913,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,ever since I first asked you to help me—she can then ask me about the
7914,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,return of her husband.”
7915,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7916,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she"
7917,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"saw him cross the threshold, “Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?"
7918,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming"
7919,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.”
7920,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7921,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “The stranger is quite"
7922,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one"
7923,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much"
7924,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can"
7925,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,hear him and talk to him as you will.”
7926,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7927,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“The man is no fool,” answered Penelope, “it would very likely be as he"
7928,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as"
7929,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,these men are.”
7930,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7931,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had"
7932,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear
7933,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"so that none could overhear him, “My dear sir, I will now go back to"
7934,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"the pigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look"
7935,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"to what is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of"
7936,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them"
7937,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,to a bad end before they do us a mischief.”
7938,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,
7939,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"“Very well,” replied Telemachus, “go home when you have had your"
7940,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,"dinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to"
7941,STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.,sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.”

8049,FROM THE SUITORS—THE BRAZIERS—ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.,into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up
8050,FROM THE SUITORS—THE BRAZIERS—ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.,"against the wall and put his staff in his hands. “Sit here,” said he,"

8346,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"to Telemachus, “Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it"
8347,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have
8348,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the
8349,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away,"
8350,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more
8351,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over
8352,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may"

8355,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8356,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Telemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse"
8357,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Euryclea and said, “Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I"
8358,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store

8374,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said,"
8375,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,"
8376,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a"
8377,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from
8378,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,heaven.”
8379,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8380,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Hush,” answered Ulysses, “hold your peace and ask no questions, for"

8389,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8390,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and"
8391,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the
8392,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a
8393,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered
8394,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the"
8395,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,women’s room to join her. They set about removing the tables at which
8396,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was"
8397,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers"
8398,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light"
8399,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,"
8400,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all"
8401,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"night and spying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat"
8402,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"your supper there, or you shall be driven out with a firebrand.”"
8403,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8404,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses scowled at her and answered, “My good woman, why should you be"
8405,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all"
8406,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner"
8407,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"of tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once, and had a"
8408,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I
8409,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number"
8410,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"of servants, and all the other things which people have who live well"
8411,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from"
8412,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and"
8413,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you
8414,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come"
8415,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"home, for there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though"
8416,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo’s will he has left a son"
8417,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"behind him, Telemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids"
8418,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"in the house, for he is now no longer in his boyhood.”"
8419,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8420,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, “Impudent"
8421,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"baggage,” said she, “I see how abominably you are behaving, and you"
8422,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,"
8423,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"that I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for"
8424,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.”
8425,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8426,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Then she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, “Bring a seat with a"
8427,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,"
8428,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.”
8429,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8430,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon"
8431,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, “Stranger, I shall"
8432,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and
8433,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,parents.”
8434,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8435,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “who on the face of the whole earth can dare"
8436,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself;
8437,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the"
8438,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and
8439,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs,"
8440,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people"
8441,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask"
8442,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"me some other question and do not seek to know my race and family, or"
8443,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,you will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am
8444,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in"
8445,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"another person’s house, nor is it well to be thus grieving continually."
8446,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"I shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me,"
8447,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,and saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine.”
8448,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8449,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Then Penelope answered, “Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,"
8450,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my"
8451,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs
8452,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,I should be both more respected and should show a better presence to
8453,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions"
8454,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our
8455,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"islands—Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself, are"
8456,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore
8457,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say"
8458,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted"
8459,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to"
8460,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven
8461,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to"
8462,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to
8463,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"them, ‘Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to"
8464,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in
8465,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,needlework perish unrecorded—till I have finished making a pall for the
8466,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him."
8467,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out"
8468,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"without a pall.’ This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I"
8469,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would"
8470,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for
8471,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"three years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was"
8472,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been"
8473,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"accomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to"
8474,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry"
8475,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"with me, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And"
8476,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,now I do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of
8477,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my"
8478,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for"
8479,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,he is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able
8480,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"to look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an"
8481,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you"
8482,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,are and where you come from—for you must have had father and mother of
8483,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.”
8484,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8485,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in"
8486,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me:"
8487,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as I
8488,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as"
8489,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and
8490,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and
8491,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different
8492,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave"
8493,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a"
8494,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had"
8495,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"a conference with Jove himself.152 Minos was father to Deucalion, whose"
8496,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus"
8497,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my"
8498,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"brother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the"
8499,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him
8500,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy,"
8501,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in
8502,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to"
8503,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then
8504,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,raging. As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for
8505,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had"
8506,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took"
8507,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had"
8508,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with"
8509,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"barley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and"
8510,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart’s content. They stayed with
8511,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong"
8512,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,that one could hardly keep one’s feet on land. I suppose some
8513,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the"
8514,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"wind dropped, and they got away.”"
8515,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8516,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept"
8517,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the"
8518,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed
8519,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so"
8520,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time
8521,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he"
8522,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,kept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them so much as
8523,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had"
8524,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: “Now,"
8525,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really"
8526,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me,"
8527,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so"
8528,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,also with his companions.”
8529,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8530,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “it is such a long time ago that I can"
8531,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and"
8532,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.
8533,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened"
8534,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this
8535,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,there was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his
8536,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one"
8537,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in gold, the"
8538,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was"
8539,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,struggling convulsively to escape.153 As for the shirt that he wore
8540,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an"
8541,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women"
8542,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that"
8543,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or"
8544,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,whether one of his companions had given them to him while he was on his
8545,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a
8546,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"present of them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals"
8547,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful
8548,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet,"
8549,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a
8550,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what"
8551,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"he was like; his shoulders were hunched,154 he was dark, and he had"
8552,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with"
8553,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"greater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most"
8554,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,like-minded with himself.”
8555,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8556,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable
8557,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found
8558,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"relief in tears she said to him, “Stranger, I was already disposed to"
8559,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my"
8560,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them
8561,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also"
8562,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him
8563,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that
8564,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.”
8565,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8566,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure"
8567,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can"
8568,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and
8569,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even"
8570,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"though he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god."
8571,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide"
8572,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"nothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately"
8573,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the
8574,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has"
8575,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were
8576,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the"
8577,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the
8578,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"sun-god’s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck"
8579,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the
8580,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him"
8581,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to"
8582,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here
8583,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering"
8584,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no
8585,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all
8586,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"this, and he swore to me—making drink-offerings in his house as he did"
8587,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,so—that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would
8588,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there"
8589,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island
8590,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got"
8591,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep"
8592,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,his family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to
8593,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know"
8594,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or
8595,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is
8596,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer;
8597,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is"
8598,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of"
8599,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely"
8600,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end
8601,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”
8602,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8603,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you"
8604,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you
8605,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses
8606,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely"
8607,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in"
8608,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them"
8609,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make"
8610,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and"
8611,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,"
8612,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It
8613,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil
8614,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For"
8615,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to"
8616,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let"
8617,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a
8618,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill"
8619,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously of them when they"
8620,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the people"
8621,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call him blessed.”"
8622,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8623,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses answered, “Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the"
8624,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will
8625,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after
8626,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for"
8627,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let"
8628,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you"
8629,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as much trouble
8630,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"as I have, I will allow her to wash them.”"
8631,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8632,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"To this Penelope said, “My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet"
8633,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such
8634,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most
8635,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,respectable old woman—the same who received my poor dear husband in her
8636,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very"
8637,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.” “Come here,” said she,"
8638,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Euryclea, and wash your master’s age-mate; I suppose Ulysses’ hands"
8639,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of"
8640,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,us dreadfully fast.”
8641,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8642,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began
8643,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"to weep and made lamentation saying, “My dear child, I cannot think"
8644,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more
8645,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"god-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole"
8646,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs"
8647,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your
8648,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,son grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone
8649,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in
8650,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all
8651,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,these sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your not
8652,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have
8653,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope"
8654,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope’s sake
8655,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of"
8656,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend"
8657,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before
8658,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like"
8659,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.”"
8660,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8661,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Those who have seen us both,” answered Ulysses, “have always said we"
8662,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.”"
8663,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8664,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his
8665,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath"
8666,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away"
8667,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold"
8668,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"of his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon"
8669,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing
8670,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"her master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by"
8671,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,a wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent
8672,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,grandfather Autolycus—who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer
8673,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,in the whole world—and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had
8674,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"endowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of"
8675,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"goats and kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It"
8676,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,happened once that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found the child
8677,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set
8678,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the infant upon his knees and said, “Autolycus, you must find a name"
8679,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.”
8680,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8681,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Son-in-law and daughter,” replied Autolycus, “call the child thus: I"
8682,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and
8683,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"another, both men and women; so name the child ‘Ulysses,’ or the child"
8684,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother’s family on
8685,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Mt. Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and"
8686,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,will send him on his way rejoicing.”
8687,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8688,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from"
8689,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Autolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome."
8690,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his"
8691,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to"
8692,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"get dinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five"
8693,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints;"
8694,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,these they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them;
8695,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus
8696,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and"
8697,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the
8698,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"sun set and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of"
8699,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,sleep.
8700,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8701,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of"
8702,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too."
8703,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy
8704,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,"
8705,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a"
8706,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the
8707,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,"
8708,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear"
8709,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick
8710,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it,"
8711,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"nor could the sun’s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick"
8712,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men’s feet, and the"
8713,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he"
8714,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay"
8715,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his
8716,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick"
8717,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a"
8718,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar,"
8719,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went"
8720,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life"
8721,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the
8722,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses’ wound; then, after saying a"
8723,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But"
8724,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made"
8725,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"him some splendid presents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much"
8726,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"mutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced"
8727,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"to see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to"
8728,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was
8729,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.
8730,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8731,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well
8732,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"hold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg"
8733,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the"
8734,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea’s eyes between her joy and her
8735,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught"
8736,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses by the beard and said, “My dear child, I am sure you must be"
8737,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched"
8738,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,and handled you.”
8739,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8740,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her"
8741,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look"
8742,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had"
8743,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with
8744,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,"
8745,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own"
8746,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to"
8747,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to
8748,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"recognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it to any"
8749,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"one else in the house, for if you do I tell you—and it shall surely"
8750,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"be—that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will"
8751,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other"
8752,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,women.”
8753,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8754,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“My child,” answered Euryclea, “what are you talking about? You know"
8755,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my
8756,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay"
8757,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into"
8758,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have"
8759,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.”"
8760,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8761,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"And Ulysses answered, “Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am"
8762,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your
8763,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,tongue and leave everything to heaven.”
8764,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8765,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"As he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,"
8766,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and
8767,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"anointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm"
8768,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking"
8769,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,to him and said:
8770,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8771,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another"
8772,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"matter. It is indeed nearly bed time—for those, at least, who can sleep"
8773,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such"
8774,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and"
8775,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the"
8776,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie"
8777,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"awake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and"
8778,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in"
8779,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a"
8780,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own
8781,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in"
8782,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard"
8783,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard"
8784,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"to public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is"
8785,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,not now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing
8786,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still
8787,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"young, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my"
8788,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"husband’s house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to"
8789,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"do so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his"
8790,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"property. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for"
8791,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of
8792,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"a trough,155 and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great"
8793,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into"
8794,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he
8795,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;"
8796,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"whereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so"
8797,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he
8798,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with"
8799,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"human voice, and told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’ he"
8800,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"said, ‘daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen"
8801,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no"
8802,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who"
8803,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On this I woke, and"
8804,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as
8805,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,usual.”
8806,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8807,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"“This dream, Madam,” replied Ulysses, “can admit but of one"
8808,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be"
8809,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single"
8810,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,one of them will escape.”
8811,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8812,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"And Penelope answered, “Stranger, dreams are very curious and"
8813,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"unaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come"
8814,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,true. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies
8815,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come"
8816,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn"
8817,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"mean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my"
8818,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be"
8819,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say—and lay
8820,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,my saying to your heart—the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened
8821,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to"
8822,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the
8823,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is"
8824,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the
8825,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and"
8826,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow"
8827,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of"
8828,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I"
8829,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”
8830,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8831,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your"
8832,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,"
8833,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.”"
8834,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8835,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"To this Penelope said, “As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk to"
8836,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do"
8837,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on"
8838,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,earth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline
8839,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from
8840,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.”
8841,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,
8842,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"She then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her"
8843,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,"maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva"
8844,LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.,shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.

8857,HOUSE.,
8858,HOUSE.,"Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock’s hide, on the"
8859,HOUSE.,"top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten,"
8860,HOUSE.,and Eurynome156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down.
8861,HOUSE.,"There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he"
8862,HOUSE.,"should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had been in the"
8863,HOUSE.,"habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling"
8864,HOUSE.,"and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and he"
8865,HOUSE.,doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and
8866,HOUSE.,"there, or to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors."
8867,HOUSE.,"His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and"
8868,HOUSE.,"shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with"
8869,HOUSE.,anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast
8870,HOUSE.,"and said, “Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day"
8871,HOUSE.,when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in
8872,HOUSE.,"silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made"
8873,HOUSE.,sure of being killed.”
8874,HOUSE.,
8875,HOUSE.,"Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he"
8876,HOUSE.,tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
8877,HOUSE.,"of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that"
8878,HOUSE.,"he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself"
8879,HOUSE.,"about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he"
8880,HOUSE.,"was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked"
8881,HOUSE.,suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of
8882,HOUSE.,"a woman, and hovered over his head saying, “My poor unhappy man, why do"
8883,HOUSE.,you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside
8884,HOUSE.,"it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may"
8885,HOUSE.,be proud of.”
8886,HOUSE.,
8887,HOUSE.,"“Goddess,” answered Ulysses, “all that you have said is true, but I am"
8888,HOUSE.,in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors
8889,HOUSE.,"single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there"
8890,HOUSE.,"is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing"
8891,HOUSE.,"that with Jove’s and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must"
8892,HOUSE.,ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it
8893,HOUSE.,is all over.”
8894,HOUSE.,
8895,HOUSE.,"“For shame,” replied Minerva, “why, any one else would trust a worse"
8896,HOUSE.,"ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less"
8897,HOUSE.,"wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you"
8898,HOUSE.,throughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though
8899,HOUSE.,"there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you"
8900,HOUSE.,"should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you."
8901,HOUSE.,"But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you"
8902,HOUSE.,shall be out of your troubles before long.”
8903,HOUSE.,
8904,HOUSE.,"As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to"
8905,HOUSE.,Olympus.
8906,HOUSE.,
8907,HOUSE.,While Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that
8908,HOUSE.,"eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting"
8909,HOUSE.,up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping
8910,HOUSE.,"she prayed to Diana saying, “Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove,"
8911,HOUSE.,drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch
8912,HOUSE.,me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the
8913,HOUSE.,"mouths of over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus."
8914,HOUSE.,"The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods"
8915,HOUSE.,"killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them,"
8916,HOUSE.,"and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to"
8917,HOUSE.,excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an
8918,HOUSE.,"imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of"
8919,HOUSE.,accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see
8920,HOUSE.,Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall
8921,HOUSE.,happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and
8922,HOUSE.,spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I
8923,HOUSE.,"wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight,"
8924,HOUSE.,"or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go even beneath"
8925,HOUSE.,"the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and"
8926,HOUSE.,"without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no"
8927,HOUSE.,"matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so"
8928,HOUSE.,"long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in"
8929,HOUSE.,slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me
8930,HOUSE.,even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my
8931,HOUSE.,"side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host,"
8932,HOUSE.,"and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very truth"
8933,HOUSE.,itself.”
8934,HOUSE.,
8935,HOUSE.,"On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and"
8936,HOUSE.,"it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by"
8937,HOUSE.,his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had
8938,HOUSE.,"lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock’s"
8939,HOUSE.,"hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed,"
8940,HOUSE.,"saying “Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and"
8941,HOUSE.,"sea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me,"
8942,HOUSE.,give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are
8943,HOUSE.,"now waking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind"
8944,HOUSE.,from outside.”
8945,HOUSE.,
8946,HOUSE.,Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up
8947,HOUSE.,"among the clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad"
8948,HOUSE.,"when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman"
8949,HOUSE.,from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another
8950,HOUSE.,sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind
8951,HOUSE.,wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground
8952,HOUSE.,"their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet"
8953,HOUSE.,"finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard"
8954,HOUSE.,the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.
8955,HOUSE.,"“Father Jove,” said she, “you, who rule over heaven and earth, you have"
8956,HOUSE.,"thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this"
8957,HOUSE.,"means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor"
8958,HOUSE.,"servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the"
8959,HOUSE.,suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour
8960,HOUSE.,"of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may never have another"
8961,HOUSE.,dinner anywhere at all.”
8962,HOUSE.,
8963,HOUSE.,Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman’s
8964,HOUSE.,"speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should"
8965,HOUSE.,avenge himself on the suitors.
8966,HOUSE.,
8967,HOUSE.,Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;
8968,HOUSE.,Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about
8969,HOUSE.,"his shoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a"
8970,HOUSE.,doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the
8971,HOUSE.,"threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, “Nurse, did you make"
8972,HOUSE.,"the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let"
8973,HOUSE.,"him shift for himself?—for my mother, good woman though she is, has a"
8974,HOUSE.,"way of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting"
8975,HOUSE.,others who are in reality much better men.”
8976,HOUSE.,
8977,HOUSE.,"“Do not find fault child,” said Euryclea, “when there is no one to find"
8978,HOUSE.,fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked:
8979,HOUSE.,your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he
8980,HOUSE.,would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make
8981,HOUSE.,"one for him, but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would"
8982,HOUSE.,not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an
8983,HOUSE.,undressed bullock’s hide and some sheepskins put for him in the
8984,HOUSE.,cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.”157
8985,HOUSE.,
8986,HOUSE.,Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans
8987,HOUSE.,"were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not"
8988,HOUSE.,"alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids"
8989,HOUSE.,"and said, “Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and"
8990,HOUSE.,sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the
8991,HOUSE.,"seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out"
8992,HOUSE.,"the mixing-jugs and the cups, and go for water from the fountain at"
8993,HOUSE.,"once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early, for"
8994,HOUSE.,it is a feast day.”
8995,HOUSE.,
8996,HOUSE.,"Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them"
8997,HOUSE.,"went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to"
8998,HOUSE.,work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors
8999,HOUSE.,also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned
9000,HOUSE.,"from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three"
9001,HOUSE.,"best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and"
9002,HOUSE.,"then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses, “Stranger, are the suitors"
9003,HOUSE.,"treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?”"
9004,HOUSE.,
9005,HOUSE.,"“May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with"
9006,HOUSE.,which they deal high-handedly in another man’s house without any sense
9007,HOUSE.,of shame.”
9008,HOUSE.,
9009,HOUSE.,"Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for"
9010,HOUSE.,he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he
9011,HOUSE.,"had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,"
9012,HOUSE.,"and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here,"
9013,HOUSE.,"stranger,” said he, “to pester people by begging about the house? Why"
9014,HOUSE.,can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding
9015,HOUSE.,before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without
9016,HOUSE.,any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the
9017,HOUSE.,"Achaeans, as well as here?”"
9018,HOUSE.,
9019,HOUSE.,"Ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third"
9020,HOUSE.,"man, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and"
9021,HOUSE.,some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to
9022,HOUSE.,take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his
9023,HOUSE.,"heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to"
9024,HOUSE.,"the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he, “is this stranger that is"
9025,HOUSE.,lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does
9026,HOUSE.,"he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man,"
9027,HOUSE.,but the gods give sorrow to whom they will—even to kings if it so
9028,HOUSE.,pleases them.”
9029,HOUSE.,
9030,HOUSE.,As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;
9031,HOUSE.,"“Good day to you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem to be very"
9032,HOUSE.,"poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father"
9033,HOUSE.,"Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,"
9034,HOUSE.,yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat
9035,HOUSE.,"came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he"
9036,HOUSE.,"reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags as"
9037,HOUSE.,"this man’s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is"
9038,HOUSE.,"already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,"
9039,HOUSE.,who made me his stockman when I was quite young among the
9040,HOUSE.,"Cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done"
9041,HOUSE.,"better with them than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn;"
9042,HOUSE.,"nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who"
9043,HOUSE.,"take no heed to his son though he is in the house, and fear not the"
9044,HOUSE.,"wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide Ulysses’ property"
9045,HOUSE.,among them because he has been away so long. I have often thought—only
9046,HOUSE.,it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with the
9047,HOUSE.,"cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still"
9048,HOUSE.,harder to stay here and be ill-treated about other people’s herds. My
9049,HOUSE.,"position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put"
9050,HOUSE.,"myself under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my"
9051,HOUSE.,"poor master will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of"
9052,HOUSE.,the house.”
9053,HOUSE.,
9054,HOUSE.,"“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well-disposed"
9055,HOUSE.,"person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will"
9056,HOUSE.,"tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of"
9057,HOUSE.,"all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses"
9058,HOUSE.,"shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you"
9059,HOUSE.,shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.”
9060,HOUSE.,
9061,HOUSE.,"“If Jove were to bring this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should"
9062,HOUSE.,see how I would do my very utmost to help him.”
9063,HOUSE.,
9064,HOUSE.,And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.
9065,HOUSE.,
9066,HOUSE.,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to
9067,HOUSE.,murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand—an
9068,HOUSE.,"eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, “My friends,"
9069,HOUSE.,this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to
9070,HOUSE.,dinner instead.”
9071,HOUSE.,
9072,HOUSE.,"The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the"
9073,HOUSE.,"benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the"
9074,HOUSE.,"heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round."
9075,HOUSE.,"They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every"
9076,HOUSE.,"man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the bread"
9077,HOUSE.,"baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid"
9078,HOUSE.,their hands upon the good things that were before them.
9079,HOUSE.,
9080,HOUSE.,Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that
9081,HOUSE.,was paved with stone;158 he gave him a shabby looking seat at a little
9082,HOUSE.,"table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to"
9083,HOUSE.,"him, with his wine in a gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your"
9084,HOUSE.,wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows
9085,HOUSE.,"of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses,"
9086,HOUSE.,"and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and"
9087,HOUSE.,"your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.”"
9088,HOUSE.,
9089,HOUSE.,"The suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his"
9090,HOUSE.,"speech; then Antinous said, “We do not like such language but we will"
9091,HOUSE.,"put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If"
9092,HOUSE.,Jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.”
9093,HOUSE.,
9094,HOUSE.,"Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the"
9095,HOUSE.,"heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the"
9096,HOUSE.,Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.
9097,HOUSE.,
9098,HOUSE.,"Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man"
9099,HOUSE.,"his portion, and feasted to their heart’s content; those who waited at"
9100,HOUSE.,"table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for"
9101,HOUSE.,Telemachus had told them to do so.
9102,HOUSE.,
9103,HOUSE.,But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their
9104,HOUSE.,"insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against"
9105,HOUSE.,"them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name"
9106,HOUSE.,"was Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man, confident in his great"
9107,HOUSE.,"wealth, was paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the"
9108,HOUSE.,"suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as"
9109,HOUSE.,"large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor"
9110,HOUSE.,"reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will,"
9111,HOUSE.,"however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have"
9112,HOUSE.,"something to give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses’"
9113,HOUSE.,servants.”
9114,HOUSE.,
9115,HOUSE.,As he spoke he picked up a heifer’s foot from the meat-basket in which
9116,HOUSE.,"it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little"
9117,HOUSE.,"aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion159 as he did"
9118,HOUSE.,"so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to"
9119,HOUSE.,"Ctesippus, “It is a good thing for you,” said he, “that the stranger"
9120,HOUSE.,turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should
9121,HOUSE.,"have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to"
9122,HOUSE.,see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let
9123,HOUSE.,"me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up"
9124,HOUSE.,"now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,"
9125,HOUSE.,instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long
9126,HOUSE.,seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have
9127,HOUSE.,"put up with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no"
9128,HOUSE.,"further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far"
9129,HOUSE.,rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day—guests
9130,HOUSE.,"insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an"
9131,HOUSE.,unseemly way.”
9132,HOUSE.,
9133,HOUSE.,"They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,"
9134,HOUSE.,"“No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it,"
9135,HOUSE.,"for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the"
9136,HOUSE.,"stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I"
9137,HOUSE.,"would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which"
9138,HOUSE.,"I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’ I would say, ‘as you had"
9139,HOUSE.,"ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could"
9140,HOUSE.,complain of your waiting and suffering160 the suitors to be in your
9141,HOUSE.,"house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but it"
9142,HOUSE.,is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all
9143,HOUSE.,"this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man,"
9144,HOUSE.,and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will
9145,HOUSE.,"yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink"
9146,HOUSE.,"in peace, while your mother will look after some other man’s house, not"
9147,HOUSE.,yours.’”
9148,HOUSE.,
9149,HOUSE.,"To this Telemachus answered, “By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of"
9150,HOUSE.,"my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is"
9151,HOUSE.,"wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my"
9152,HOUSE.,mother’s marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she
9153,HOUSE.,"will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare"
9154,HOUSE.,not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own
9155,HOUSE.,wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.”
9156,HOUSE.,
9157,HOUSE.,"Minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set"
9158,HOUSE.,their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.
9159,HOUSE.,"Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and"
9160,HOUSE.,their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and
9161,HOUSE.,"said, “Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of"
9162,HOUSE.,"darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with"
9163,HOUSE.,tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams
9164,HOUSE.,drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are
9165,HOUSE.,full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted
9166,HOUSE.,"out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.”"
9167,HOUSE.,
9168,HOUSE.,"Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus"
9169,HOUSE.,"then said, “This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses."
9170,HOUSE.,"Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark"
9171,HOUSE.,here.”
9172,HOUSE.,
9173,HOUSE.,"But Theoclymenus said, “Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me."
9174,HOUSE.,"I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an"
9175,HOUSE.,"understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I"
9176,HOUSE.,"see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are"
9177,HOUSE.,insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be
9178,HOUSE.,able to escape.”
9179,HOUSE.,
9180,HOUSE.,"He left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him"
9181,HOUSE.,"welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking"
9182,HOUSE.,Telemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to
9183,HOUSE.,"him, “Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this"
9184,HOUSE.,"importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill"
9185,HOUSE.,"for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here"
9186,HOUSE.,is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me
9187,HOUSE.,"persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board ship and"
9188,HOUSE.,send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.”
9189,HOUSE.,
9190,HOUSE.,"Telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,"
9191,HOUSE.,expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.
9192,HOUSE.,
9193,HOUSE.,"Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat"
9194,HOUSE.,"placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear"
9195,HOUSE.,what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid
9196,HOUSE.,"much merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had"
9197,HOUSE.,"sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing"
9198,HOUSE.,can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a
9199,HOUSE.,brave man were soon to lay before them—for they had brought their doom
9200,HOUSE.,upon themselves.

9209,AND PHILOETIUS,AND PHILOETIUS
9210,AND PHILOETIUS,
9211,AND PHILOETIUS,
9212,AND PHILOETIUS,Minerva now put it in Penelope’s mind to make the suitors try their
9213,AND PHILOETIUS,"skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,"
9214,AND PHILOETIUS,as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and
9215,AND PHILOETIUS,"got the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of"
9216,AND PHILOETIUS,ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store-room at the end of
9217,AND PHILOETIUS,"the house, where her husband’s treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought"
9218,AND PHILOETIUS,"iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of"
9219,AND PHILOETIUS,deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in
9220,AND PHILOETIUS,Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another
9221,AND PHILOETIUS,"in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in"
9222,AND PHILOETIUS,order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the
9223,AND PHILOETIUS,"Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had"
9224,AND PHILOETIUS,sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these
9225,AND PHILOETIUS,"Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and"
9226,AND PHILOETIUS,the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had
9227,AND PHILOETIUS,gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had
9228,AND PHILOETIUS,"lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were"
9229,AND PHILOETIUS,"the death of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove’s"
9230,AND PHILOETIUS,"son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules"
9231,AND PHILOETIUS,"to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not"
9232,AND PHILOETIUS,"heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set"
9233,AND PHILOETIUS,"before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the"
9234,AND PHILOETIUS,"mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and"
9235,AND PHILOETIUS,"gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which"
9236,AND PHILOETIUS,on his death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in
9237,AND PHILOETIUS,"return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast"
9238,AND PHILOETIUS,"friendship, although they never visited at one another’s houses, for"
9239,AND PHILOETIUS,"Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow,"
9240,AND PHILOETIUS,"then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when"
9241,AND PHILOETIUS,"he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but"
9242,AND PHILOETIUS,had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.
9243,AND PHILOETIUS,
9244,AND PHILOETIUS,Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the
9245,AND PHILOETIUS,"carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get"
9246,AND PHILOETIUS,it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the
9247,AND PHILOETIUS,"doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the"
9248,AND PHILOETIUS,"key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the"
9249,AND PHILOETIUS,doors;161 these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a
9250,AND PHILOETIUS,"meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests"
9251,AND PHILOETIUS,stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with
9252,AND PHILOETIUS,"fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow"
9253,AND PHILOETIUS,"case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,"
9254,AND PHILOETIUS,"weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her"
9255,AND PHILOETIUS,"tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where the suitors"
9256,AND PHILOETIUS,"were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that"
9257,AND PHILOETIUS,"were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that"
9258,AND PHILOETIUS,contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.
9259,AND PHILOETIUS,"When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts"
9260,AND PHILOETIUS,"supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face,"
9261,AND PHILOETIUS,and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:
9262,AND PHILOETIUS,
9263,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of"
9264,AND PHILOETIUS,"this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other"
9265,AND PHILOETIUS,"pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize"
9266,AND PHILOETIUS,"that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of"
9267,AND PHILOETIUS,"Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his"
9268,AND PHILOETIUS,"arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this"
9269,AND PHILOETIUS,"house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But"
9270,AND PHILOETIUS,even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”
9271,AND PHILOETIUS,
9272,AND PHILOETIUS,"As she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron"
9273,AND PHILOETIUS,"before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had"
9274,AND PHILOETIUS,"bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master’s"
9275,AND PHILOETIUS,"bow, but Antinous scolded them. “You country louts,” said he, “silly"
9276,AND PHILOETIUS,simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by
9277,AND PHILOETIUS,crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her
9278,AND PHILOETIUS,"husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go"
9279,AND PHILOETIUS,"outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors"
9280,AND PHILOETIUS,"shall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it"
9281,AND PHILOETIUS,no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of
9282,AND PHILOETIUS,us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember
9283,AND PHILOETIUS,"him, though I was then only a child.”"
9284,AND PHILOETIUS,
9285,AND PHILOETIUS,"This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to"
9286,AND PHILOETIUS,"string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be"
9287,AND PHILOETIUS,"the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,"
9288,AND PHILOETIUS,whom he was dishonouring in his own house—egging the others on to do so
9289,AND PHILOETIUS,also.
9290,AND PHILOETIUS,
9291,AND PHILOETIUS,"Then Telemachus spoke. “Great heavens!” he exclaimed, “Jove must have"
9292,AND PHILOETIUS,robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she
9293,AND PHILOETIUS,"will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying"
9294,AND PHILOETIUS,"myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the"
9295,AND PHILOETIUS,"contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman"
9296,AND PHILOETIUS,"whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in"
9297,AND PHILOETIUS,Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need
9298,AND PHILOETIUS,"have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses"
9299,AND PHILOETIUS,"for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too"
9300,AND PHILOETIUS,"will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the"
9301,AND PHILOETIUS,"iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger,"
9302,AND PHILOETIUS,not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me.”
9303,AND PHILOETIUS,
9304,AND PHILOETIUS,"As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,"
9305,AND PHILOETIUS,"and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row,"
9306,AND PHILOETIUS,"in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by"
9307,AND PHILOETIUS,"line.162 Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was"
9308,AND PHILOETIUS,"surprised when they saw him set them up so orderly, though he had never"
9309,AND PHILOETIUS,"seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement"
9310,AND PHILOETIUS,"to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his"
9311,AND PHILOETIUS,"might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had"
9312,AND PHILOETIUS,hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for
9313,AND PHILOETIUS,"the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign"
9314,AND PHILOETIUS,to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:
9315,AND PHILOETIUS,
9316,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too"
9317,AND PHILOETIUS,"young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to"
9318,AND PHILOETIUS,"hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are"
9319,AND PHILOETIUS,"stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.”"
9320,AND PHILOETIUS,
9321,AND PHILOETIUS,"On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led"
9322,AND PHILOETIUS,into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.
9323,AND PHILOETIUS,"Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous"
9324,AND PHILOETIUS,said:
9325,AND PHILOETIUS,
9326,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the"
9327,AND PHILOETIUS,place at which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.”
9328,AND PHILOETIUS,
9329,AND PHILOETIUS,"The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He"
9330,AND PHILOETIUS,"was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the"
9331,AND PHILOETIUS,mixing-bowl. 163 He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was
9332,AND PHILOETIUS,indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and
9333,AND PHILOETIUS,"arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could"
9334,AND PHILOETIUS,"not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work,"
9335,AND PHILOETIUS,"they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, “My"
9336,AND PHILOETIUS,"friends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take"
9337,AND PHILOETIUS,"the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die"
9338,AND PHILOETIUS,than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven
9339,AND PHILOETIUS,"for, and which has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even"
9340,AND PHILOETIUS,"now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen"
9341,AND PHILOETIUS,"this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some"
9342,AND PHILOETIUS,"other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer"
9343,AND PHILOETIUS,and whose lot it is to win her.”
9344,AND PHILOETIUS,
9345,AND PHILOETIUS,"On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,164 with"
9346,AND PHILOETIUS,the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat
9347,AND PHILOETIUS,again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him
9348,AND PHILOETIUS,saying:
9349,AND PHILOETIUS,
9350,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and"
9351,AND PHILOETIUS,"intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow"
9352,AND PHILOETIUS,"take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend"
9353,AND PHILOETIUS,"it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are"
9354,AND PHILOETIUS,others who will soon string it.”
9355,AND PHILOETIUS,
9356,AND PHILOETIUS,"Then he said to Melanthius the goatherd, “Look sharp, light a fire in"
9357,AND PHILOETIUS,"the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us"
9358,AND PHILOETIUS,"also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us"
9359,AND PHILOETIUS,"warm the bow and grease it—we will then make trial of it again, and"
9360,AND PHILOETIUS,bring the contest to an end.”
9361,AND PHILOETIUS,
9362,AND PHILOETIUS,"Melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside"
9363,AND PHILOETIUS,it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the
9364,AND PHILOETIUS,"house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but"
9365,AND PHILOETIUS,they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless
9366,AND PHILOETIUS,"there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders"
9367,AND PHILOETIUS,among the suitors and much the foremost among them all.
9368,AND PHILOETIUS,
9369,AND PHILOETIUS,"Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and"
9370,AND PHILOETIUS,Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the
9371,AND PHILOETIUS,"outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:"
9372,AND PHILOETIUS,
9373,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in"
9374,AND PHILOETIUS,doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of
9375,AND PHILOETIUS,"men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back"
9376,AND PHILOETIUS,here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do—to side with the
9377,AND PHILOETIUS,"suitors, or with Ulysses?”"
9378,AND PHILOETIUS,
9379,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Father Jove,” answered the stockman, “would indeed that you might so"
9380,AND PHILOETIUS,"ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see"
9381,AND PHILOETIUS,with what might and main I would fight for him.”
9382,AND PHILOETIUS,
9383,AND PHILOETIUS,In like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;
9384,AND PHILOETIUS,"when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses"
9385,AND PHILOETIUS,"said, “It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at"
9386,AND PHILOETIUS,"last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find"
9387,AND PHILOETIUS,"that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for"
9388,AND PHILOETIUS,"I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,"
9389,AND PHILOETIUS,"therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall"
9390,AND PHILOETIUS,"deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you,"
9391,AND PHILOETIUS,"will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me"
9392,AND PHILOETIUS,as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give
9393,AND PHILOETIUS,"you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is"
9394,AND PHILOETIUS,the scar from the boar’s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on
9395,AND PHILOETIUS,Mt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.”
9396,AND PHILOETIUS,
9397,AND PHILOETIUS,"As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they"
9398,AND PHILOETIUS,"had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw"
9399,AND PHILOETIUS,"their arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses"
9400,AND PHILOETIUS,kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down
9401,AND PHILOETIUS,upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:
9402,AND PHILOETIUS,
9403,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and"
9404,AND PHILOETIUS,"tell those who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both"
9405,AND PHILOETIUS,"together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this"
9406,AND PHILOETIUS,moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to
9407,AND PHILOETIUS,"prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore,"
9408,AND PHILOETIUS,"Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell"
9409,AND PHILOETIUS,the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any
9410,AND PHILOETIUS,"groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not"
9411,AND PHILOETIUS,"come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work."
9412,AND PHILOETIUS,"And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer"
9413,AND PHILOETIUS,"court, and to bind them securely at once.”"
9414,AND PHILOETIUS,
9415,AND PHILOETIUS,"When he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat"
9416,AND PHILOETIUS,"that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside."
9417,AND PHILOETIUS,
9418,AND PHILOETIUS,"At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming"
9419,AND PHILOETIUS,"it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly"
9420,AND PHILOETIUS,"grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, “I grieve for myself and for"
9421,AND PHILOETIUS,"us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not"
9422,AND PHILOETIUS,"care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in"
9423,AND PHILOETIUS,Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so
9424,AND PHILOETIUS,inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This
9425,AND PHILOETIUS,will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.”
9426,AND PHILOETIUS,
9427,AND PHILOETIUS,"“It shall not be so, Eurymachus,” said Antinous, “and you know it"
9428,AND PHILOETIUS,yourself. Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can
9429,AND PHILOETIUS,string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side—as for the axes
9430,AND PHILOETIUS,"they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house"
9431,AND PHILOETIUS,"and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we"
9432,AND PHILOETIUS,may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will
9433,AND PHILOETIUS,tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow—the best he has; we
9434,AND PHILOETIUS,"can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make"
9435,AND PHILOETIUS,"trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.”"
9436,AND PHILOETIUS,
9437,AND PHILOETIUS,"The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over"
9438,AND PHILOETIUS,"the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine"
9439,AND PHILOETIUS,and water and handed it round after giving every man his
9440,AND PHILOETIUS,"drink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk"
9441,AND PHILOETIUS,"each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:—"
9442,AND PHILOETIUS,
9443,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am"
9444,AND PHILOETIUS,"minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has"
9445,AND PHILOETIUS,just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and
9446,AND PHILOETIUS,"leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give"
9447,AND PHILOETIUS,"victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that"
9448,AND PHILOETIUS,"I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I"
9449,AND PHILOETIUS,"still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and"
9450,AND PHILOETIUS,neglect have made an end of it.”
9451,AND PHILOETIUS,
9452,AND PHILOETIUS,"This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,"
9453,AND PHILOETIUS,"Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature, you"
9454,AND PHILOETIUS,have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to
9455,AND PHILOETIUS,think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your
9456,AND PHILOETIUS,"betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others"
9457,AND PHILOETIUS,"have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other"
9458,AND PHILOETIUS,beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among
9459,AND PHILOETIUS,"ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does"
9460,AND PHILOETIUS,with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the
9461,AND PHILOETIUS,Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the
9462,AND PHILOETIUS,"Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill"
9463,AND PHILOETIUS,deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were
9464,AND PHILOETIUS,"there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and"
9465,AND PHILOETIUS,"nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house,"
9466,AND PHILOETIUS,"so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of"
9467,AND PHILOETIUS,"understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and"
9468,AND PHILOETIUS,"the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own"
9469,AND PHILOETIUS,drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with
9470,AND PHILOETIUS,"you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here,"
9471,AND PHILOETIUS,"for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one"
9472,AND PHILOETIUS,"that comes near him: you will never get away alive, so drink and keep"
9473,AND PHILOETIUS,quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.”
9474,AND PHILOETIUS,
9475,AND PHILOETIUS,"Penelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that"
9476,AND PHILOETIUS,you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.
9477,AND PHILOETIUS,If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of
9478,AND PHILOETIUS,"Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make"
9479,AND PHILOETIUS,me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:
9480,AND PHILOETIUS,none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all
9481,AND PHILOETIUS,reason.”
9482,AND PHILOETIUS,
9483,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Queen Penelope,” answered Eurymachus, “we do not suppose that this man"
9484,AND PHILOETIUS,will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest
9485,AND PHILOETIUS,"some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go"
9486,AND PHILOETIUS,"gossiping about and say, ‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are"
9487,AND PHILOETIUS,paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was
9488,AND PHILOETIUS,"able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung"
9489,AND PHILOETIUS,it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This is what will be
9490,AND PHILOETIUS,"said, and it will be a scandal against us.”"
9491,AND PHILOETIUS,
9492,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Eurymachus,” Penelope answered, “people who persist in eating up the"
9493,AND PHILOETIUS,estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect
9494,AND PHILOETIUS,others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as
9495,AND PHILOETIUS,"you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says"
9496,AND PHILOETIUS,"moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see"
9497,AND PHILOETIUS,whether he can string it or no. I say—and it shall surely be—that if
9498,AND PHILOETIUS,"Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a"
9499,AND PHILOETIUS,"cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and"
9500,AND PHILOETIUS,"robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see"
9501,AND PHILOETIUS,him sent safely wherever he wants to go.”
9502,AND PHILOETIUS,
9503,AND PHILOETIUS,"Then Telemachus said, “Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in"
9504,AND PHILOETIUS,the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one
9505,AND PHILOETIUS,have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the
9506,AND PHILOETIUS,"other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the"
9507,AND PHILOETIUS,"bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the"
9508,AND PHILOETIUS,"house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your"
9509,AND PHILOETIUS,"distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man’s matter,"
9510,AND PHILOETIUS,"and mine above all others, for it is I who am master here.”"
9511,AND PHILOETIUS,
9512,AND PHILOETIUS,"She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in"
9513,AND PHILOETIUS,"her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she"
9514,AND PHILOETIUS,mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her
9515,AND PHILOETIUS,eyelids.
9516,AND PHILOETIUS,
9517,AND PHILOETIUS,"The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but"
9518,AND PHILOETIUS,"the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one"
9519,AND PHILOETIUS,"of them said, “You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out"
9520,AND PHILOETIUS,"of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your"
9521,AND PHILOETIUS,"own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry"
9522,AND PHILOETIUS,you to death.”
9523,AND PHILOETIUS,
9524,AND PHILOETIUS,"Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow"
9525,AND PHILOETIUS,"down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other"
9526,AND PHILOETIUS,"side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, “Father Eumaeus,"
9527,AND PHILOETIUS,"bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you"
9528,AND PHILOETIUS,"with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I"
9529,AND PHILOETIUS,wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as
9530,AND PHILOETIUS,"I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for"
9531,AND PHILOETIUS,they mean mischief.”
9532,AND PHILOETIUS,
9533,AND PHILOETIUS,"Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put"
9534,AND PHILOETIUS,them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on
9535,AND PHILOETIUS,"and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called"
9536,AND PHILOETIUS,"Euryclea apart and said to her, “Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to"
9537,AND PHILOETIUS,close the doors of the women’s apartments. If they hear any groaning or
9538,AND PHILOETIUS,"uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out,"
9539,AND PHILOETIUS,but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.”
9540,AND PHILOETIUS,
9541,AND PHILOETIUS,Euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women’s
9542,AND PHILOETIUS,apartments.
9543,AND PHILOETIUS,
9544,AND PHILOETIUS,Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the
9545,AND PHILOETIUS,outer court. There was a ship’s cable of byblus fibre lying in the
9546,AND PHILOETIUS,"gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,"
9547,AND PHILOETIUS,"resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who"
9548,AND PHILOETIUS,"had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,"
9549,AND PHILOETIUS,and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into
9550,AND PHILOETIUS,its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his
9551,AND PHILOETIUS,"neighbour saying, “This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has"
9552,AND PHILOETIUS,"got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike"
9553,AND PHILOETIUS,style does the old vagabond handle it.”
9554,AND PHILOETIUS,
9555,AND PHILOETIUS,"Another said, “I hope he may be no more successful in other things than"
9556,AND PHILOETIUS,he is likely to be in stringing this bow.”
9557,AND PHILOETIUS,
9558,AND PHILOETIUS,"But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung"
9559,AND PHILOETIUS,it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes
9560,AND PHILOETIUS,the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to
9561,AND PHILOETIUS,"prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the"
9562,AND PHILOETIUS,"twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour"
9563,AND PHILOETIUS,"as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a"
9564,AND PHILOETIUS,"sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the"
9565,AND PHILOETIUS,son of scheming Saturn had sent him.
9566,AND PHILOETIUS,
9567,AND PHILOETIUS,He took an arrow that was lying upon the table165—for those which the
9568,AND PHILOETIUS,Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver—he
9569,AND PHILOETIUS,"laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow"
9570,AND PHILOETIUS,"and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken"
9571,AND PHILOETIUS,"aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of"
9572,AND PHILOETIUS,"the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them,"
9573,AND PHILOETIUS,and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:
9574,AND PHILOETIUS,
9575,AND PHILOETIUS,"“Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I"
9576,AND PHILOETIUS,"aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,"
9577,AND PHILOETIUS,"and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for"
9578,AND PHILOETIUS,"the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then"
9579,AND PHILOETIUS,otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the
9580,AND PHILOETIUS,crowning ornaments of a banquet.”
9581,AND PHILOETIUS,
9582,AND PHILOETIUS,"As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on"
9583,AND PHILOETIUS,"his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father’s seat."

9618,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9619,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by"
9620,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of"
9621,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:
9622,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9623,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"“Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have"
9624,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"wasted my substance,167 have forced my women servants to lie with you,"
9625,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared
9626,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"neither God nor man, and now you shall die.”"
9627,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9628,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round"
9629,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"about to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone"
9630,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,spoke.
9631,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9632,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"“If you are Ulysses,” said he, “then what you have said is just. We"
9633,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who
9634,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all
9635,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so
9636,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and"
9637,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be
9638,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the death which"
9639,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything"
9640,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten"
9641,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and"
9642,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened.
9643,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Until we have done this no one can complain of your being enraged
9644,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,against us.”
9645,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9646,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Ulysses again glared at him and said, “Though you should give me all"
9647,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I"
9648,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must
9649,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.”"
9650,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9651,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:"
9652,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9653,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"“My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he"
9654,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then
9655,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from"
9656,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the"
9657,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and raise"
9658,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.”
9659,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9660,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,"
9661,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot"
9662,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself
9663,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.
9664,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the
9665,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the"
9666,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.
9667,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9668,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and
9669,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and"
9670,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and
9671,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and"
9672,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from
9673,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he"
9674,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack"
9675,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and"
9676,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,immediately was at his father’s side. Then he said:
9677,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9678,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for"
9679,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour"
9680,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.”"
9681,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9682,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"“Run and fetch them,” answered Ulysses, “while my arrows hold out, or"
9683,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,when I am alone they may get me away from the door.”
9684,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9685,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where"
9686,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four"
9687,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to
9688,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the"
9689,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses."
9690,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the"
9691,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows"
9692,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by"
9693,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders;"
9694,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of"
9695,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,168 and he grasped two"
9696,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,redoubtable bronze-shod spears.
9697,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9698,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Now there was a trap door169 on the wall, while at one end of the"
9699,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"pavement170 there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this"
9700,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,exit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand
9701,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a"
9702,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"time. But Agelaus shouted out, “Cannot some one go up to the trap door"
9703,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we"
9704,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,should soon make an end of this man and his shooting.”
9705,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9706,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"“This may not be, Agelaus,” answered Melanthius, “the mouth of the"
9707,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One
9708,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I
9709,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"will do, I will bring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is"
9710,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,there that Ulysses and his son have put them.”
9711,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9712,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room
9713,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"of Ulysses’ house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets"
9714,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to"
9715,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,the suitors. Ulysses’ heart began to fail him when he saw the
9716,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,suitors171 putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw
9717,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, “Some one of the"
9718,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be"
9719,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Melanthius.”
9720,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9721,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Telemachus answered, “The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left"
9722,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I"
9723,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the"
9724,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the"
9725,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,son of Dolius.”
9726,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9727,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the
9728,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to"
9729,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Ulysses who was beside him, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that"
9730,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to the store"
9731,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I"
9732,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many
9733,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,wrongs that he has done in your house?”
9734,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9735,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Ulysses answered, “Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,"
9736,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius’ hands
9737,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door
9738,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him"
9739,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post,172 that he may linger"
9740,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,on in an agony.”
9741,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9742,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the"
9743,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was"
9744,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two"
9745,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by
9746,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted"
9747,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,"
9748,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"but which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become"
9749,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and"
9750,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well
9751,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"behind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses"
9752,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him
9753,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"up from a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him"
9754,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus saying, “Melanthius, you will"
9755,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well
9756,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you"
9757,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on.”
9758,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9759,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on"
9760,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take
9761,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the
9762,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the"
9763,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove’s daughter
9764,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor."
9765,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, “Mentor, lend me your help,"
9766,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done"
9767,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"you. Besides, you are my age-mate.”"
9768,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9769,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the"
9770,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to
9771,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"reproach her. “Mentor,” he cried, “do not let Ulysses beguile you into"
9772,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when
9773,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too. You"
9774,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will"
9775,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"take all you have, in doors or out, and bring it into hotch-pot with"
9776,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Ulysses’ property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor"
9777,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of"
9778,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Ithaca.”
9779,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9780,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very"
9781,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"angrily.173 “Ulysses,” said she, “your strength and prowess are no"
9782,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the
9783,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those
9784,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam’s city was taken."
9785,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are
9786,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?"
9787,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Come on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of"
9788,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Alcimus shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred

9790,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9791,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still"
9792,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew"
9793,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in
9794,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,the form of a swallow.
9795,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9796,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,"
9797,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon"
9798,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,the suitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives
9799,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen"
9800,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, “My"
9801,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after"
9802,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors
9803,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your"
9804,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by"
9805,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the

9807,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9808,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of"
9809,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the
9810,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had
9811,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men, “My"
9812,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of"
9813,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us"

9815,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9816,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.
9817,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while"
9818,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others"
9819,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained
9820,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.
9821,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9822,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their"
9823,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the
9824,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of
9825,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top"
9826,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"skin from off Telemachus’s wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze"
9827,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,Eumaeus’s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to
9828,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of
9829,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus"
9830,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and"
9831,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"taunted him saying, “Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so"
9832,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your"

9836,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,
9837,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,"Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a"

9840,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.,full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the

10422,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been
10423,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird"
10424,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some
10425,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis"

10427,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore"

10450,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, “Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king"
10451,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you"
10452,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.
10453,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not"
10454,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an"
10455,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the"
10456,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and
10457,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. ‘Sweethearts,’"
10458,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry"
10459,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in needlework
10460,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,"
10461,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the"
10462,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is
10463,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon"
10464,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches"
10465,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without
10466,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth"
10467,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"year, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one"
10468,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in"
10469,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would"
10470,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had"
10471,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"it washed,186 its splendour was as that of the sun or moon."
10472,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10473,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,“Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his
10474,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a"
10475,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched"
10476,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after"
10477,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and"
10478,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came
10479,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among"
10480,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being"
10481,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but"
10482,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus"
10483,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors"
10484,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a
10485,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this
10486,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the"
10487,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"bow—nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses,"
10488,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no matter"
10489,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he"
10490,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow
10491,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured
10492,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed"
10493,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly"
10494,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of
10495,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main"
10496,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as"
10497,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"our brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our"
10498,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are"
10499,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at"
10500,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out"
10501,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according"
10502,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,to the offices due to the departed.”
10503,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10504,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,” replied the ghost of Agamemnon, “you"
10505,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare
10506,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as"
10507,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue"
10508,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be"
10509,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far
10510,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed
10511,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has"
10512,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.”
10513,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10514,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the
10515,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the
10516,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which"
10517,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a"
10518,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept"
10519,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman,"
10520,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"who looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there,"
10521,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,he said to his son and to the other two:
10522,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10523,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner."
10524,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to"
10525,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,recognise me after so long an absence.”
10526,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10527,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"He then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who"
10528,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to"
10529,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he"
10530,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for"
10531,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the"
10532,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father
10533,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very"
10534,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him
10535,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat"
10536,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw"
10537,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall"
10538,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss"
10539,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should"
10540,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it
10541,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"best to be crafty with him, so in this mind he went up to his father,"
10542,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,who was bending down and digging about a plant.
10543,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10544,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“I see, sir,” said Ulysses, “that you are an excellent gardener—what"
10545,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a"
10546,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of"
10547,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I"
10548,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are
10549,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle"
10550,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and"
10551,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble"
10552,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should wash
10553,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do;"
10554,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose"
10555,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter. Is this
10556,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,place that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just now who said
10557,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience to hear my story"
10558,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was"
10559,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"still living, or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me"
10560,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my
10561,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked
10562,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father
10563,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him"
10564,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"welcome to all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave"
10565,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and"
10566,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve
10567,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve"
10568,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal"
10569,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,number of shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled
10570,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.”"
10571,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10572,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"His father shed tears and answered, “Sir, you have indeed come to the"
10573,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked"
10574,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If
10575,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have"
10576,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,entertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply
10577,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,when you left him—as would have been only right considering what you
10578,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"had already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is"
10579,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!"
10580,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have
10581,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some"
10582,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents,"
10583,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could"
10584,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as
10585,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"was natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according to the"
10586,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"offices due to the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want to know."
10587,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Who and whence are you—tell me of your town and parents? Where is the
10588,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,ship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a
10589,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"passenger on some other man’s ship, and those who brought you here have"
10590,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,gone on their way and left you?”
10591,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10592,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“I will tell you everything,” answered Ulysses, “quite truly. I come"
10593,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who"
10594,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off
10595,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here"
10596,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open"
10597,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left"
10598,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left"
10599,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced"
10600,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have"
10601,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,another friendly meeting and exchange presents.”
10602,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10603,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both
10604,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey
10605,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,"
10606,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang
10607,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, “I am he,"
10608,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"father, about whom you are asking—I have returned after having been"
10609,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation—we have
10610,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the"
10611,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.”"
10612,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10613,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“If you really are my son Ulysses,” replied Laertes, “and have come"
10614,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as"
10615,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,shall convince me.”
10616,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10617,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“First observe this scar,” answered Ulysses, “which I got from a boar’s"
10618,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,tusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me
10619,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"to Autolycus, my mother’s father, to receive the presents which when he"
10620,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out
10621,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all"
10622,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,"
10623,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me
10624,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also"
10625,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted
10626,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of"
10627,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,heaven has been laid heavy upon them.”
10628,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10629,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Laertes’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which
10630,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to"
10631,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he"
10632,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, “O father"
10633,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have"
10634,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am"
10635,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here
10636,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the"
10637,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,cities of the Cephallenians.”
10638,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10639,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Ulysses answered, “Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,"
10640,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told
10641,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready"
10642,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,as soon as possible.”
10643,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10644,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got
10645,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting
10646,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took
10647,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on
10648,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing"
10649,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back"
10650,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said"
10651,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"to him, “My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much"
10652,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,taller and better-looking.”
10653,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10654,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Laertes answered, “Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I"
10655,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took"
10656,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I"
10657,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I"
10658,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.
10659,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced"
10660,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,to see it.”
10661,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10662,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their"
10663,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his"
10664,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and
10665,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their"
10666,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was"
10667,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were"
10668,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses"
10669,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"scolded them good naturedly and said, “Sit down to your dinner, old"
10670,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin"
10671,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,for some time and have been waiting for you.”
10672,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10673,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. “Sir,” said"
10674,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"he, seizing his master’s hand and kissing it at the wrist, “we have"
10675,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after
10676,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper"
10677,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"you.187 But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or"
10678,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,shall we send some one to tell her?”
10679,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10680,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“Old man,” answered Ulysses, “she knows already, so you need not"
10681,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"trouble about that.” On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius"
10682,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after
10683,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their
10684,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,father.
10685,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10686,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round"
10687,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the"
10688,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered"
10689,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses."
10690,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies"
10691,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the"
10692,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily
10693,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes"
10694,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son
10695,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,"
10696,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"weeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great"
10697,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he"
10698,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been"
10699,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and
10700,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule,"
10701,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an
10702,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons
10703,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"and brothers. For my own part I should have no more pleasure in life,"
10704,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before"
10705,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,they can cross over to the main land.”
10706,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10707,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard
10708,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Phemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses."
10709,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle"
10710,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"of the assembly, and Medon said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did"
10711,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an
10712,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god
10713,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously"
10714,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on
10715,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,one another.”
10716,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10717,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of"
10718,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Mastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both"
10719,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,"
10720,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"saying,"
10721,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10722,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as"
10723,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade"
10724,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the
10725,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,wantonness of their hearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the
10726,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,"
10727,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against"
10728,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your"
10729,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,own heads.”
10730,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10731,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at"
10732,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the"
10733,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;"
10734,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed"
10735,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led"
10736,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder of
10737,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to"
10738,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,perish in his attempt.
10739,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10740,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Then Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,"
10741,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,answer me this question—What do you propose to do? Will you set them
10742,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?”"
10743,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10744,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"And Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your"
10745,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the
10746,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be"
10747,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them"
10748,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to"
10749,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of"
10750,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as
10751,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.”"
10752,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10753,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she"
10754,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.
10755,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10756,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by"
10757,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"saying, “Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up to"
10758,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,us.” So one of Dolius’s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the
10759,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, “Here"
10760,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"they are, let us put on our armour at once.”"
10761,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10762,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"They put on their armour as fast as they could—that is to say Ulysses,"
10763,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did"
10764,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,the same—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they
10765,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,"
10766,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Ulysses leading the way.
10767,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10768,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Then Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form"
10769,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his"
10770,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"son Telemachus, “Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an"
10771,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"engagement, which will show every man’s mettle, be sure not to disgrace"
10772,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all the"
10773,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,world over.”
10774,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10775,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"“You say truly, my dear father,” answered Telemachus, “and you shall"
10776,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.”"
10777,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10778,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Laertes was delighted when he heard this. “Good heavens,” he exclaimed,"
10779,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,“what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and
10780,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.”
10781,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10782,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"On this Minerva came close up to him and said, “Son of Arceisius—-best"
10783,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"friend I have in the world—pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove"
10784,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.”
10785,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10786,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed"
10787,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and"
10788,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his"
10789,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
10790,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,Meantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and
10791,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed"
10792,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,"
10793,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. “Men of"
10794,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Ithaca,” she cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at"
10795,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,once without further bloodshed.”
10796,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10797,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their
10798,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of
10799,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"the goddess’ voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But"
10800,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down"
10801,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire
10802,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, “Ulysses,"
10803,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry"
10804,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,with you.”
10805,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,
10806,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed"
10807,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,"the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace"
10808,CONCLUDES A PEACE.,between the two contending parties.
