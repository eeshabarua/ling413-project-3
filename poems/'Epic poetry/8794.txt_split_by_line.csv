36,CANTO XXVI,"While singly thus along the rim we walk'd,"
37,CANTO XXVI,"Oft the good master warn'd me: ""Look thou well."
38,CANTO XXVI,"Avail it that I caution thee.""  The sun"
39,CANTO XXVI,Now all the western clime irradiate chang'd
40,CANTO XXVI,"From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass'd,"
41,CANTO XXVI,My passing shadow made the umber'd flame
42,CANTO XXVI,Burn ruddier.  At so strange a sight I mark'd
43,CANTO XXVI,That many a spirit marvel'd on his way.
44,CANTO XXVI,
45,CANTO XXVI,"This bred occasion first to speak of me,"
46,CANTO XXVI,"""He seems,"" said they, ""no insubstantial frame:"""
47,CANTO XXVI,"Then to obtain what certainty they might,"
48,CANTO XXVI,"Stretch'd towards me, careful not to overpass"
49,CANTO XXVI,"The burning pale.  ""O thou, who followest"
50,CANTO XXVI,"The others, haply not more slow than they,"
51,CANTO XXVI,"But mov'd by rev'rence, answer me, who burn"
52,CANTO XXVI,"In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these"
53,CANTO XXVI,"All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth"
54,CANTO XXVI,Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.
55,CANTO XXVI,"Tell us, how is it that thou mak'st thyself"
56,CANTO XXVI,"A wall against the sun, as thou not yet"
57,CANTO XXVI,Into th' inextricable toils of death
58,CANTO XXVI,"Hadst enter'd?""  Thus spake one, and I had straight"
59,CANTO XXVI,"Declar'd me, if attention had not turn'd"
60,CANTO XXVI,"To new appearance.  Meeting these, there came,"
61,CANTO XXVI,"Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom"
62,CANTO XXVI,"Earnestly gazing, from each part I view"
63,CANTO XXVI,"The shadows all press forward, sev'rally"
64,CANTO XXVI,"Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away."
65,CANTO XXVI,"E'en so the emmets, 'mid their dusky troops,"
66,CANTO XXVI,"Peer closely one at other, to spy out"
67,CANTO XXVI,"Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive."
68,CANTO XXVI,
69,CANTO XXVI,"That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch"
70,CANTO XXVI,"Of the first onward step, from either tribe"
71,CANTO XXVI,"Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,"
72,CANTO XXVI,"Shout ""Sodom and Gomorrah!"" these, ""The cow"
73,CANTO XXVI,"Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd"
74,CANTO XXVI,"Might rush unto her luxury.""  Then as cranes,"
75,CANTO XXVI,"That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,"
76,CANTO XXVI,"Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid"
77,CANTO XXVI,"The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off"
78,CANTO XXVI,"One crowd, advances th' other; and resume"
79,CANTO XXVI,"Their first song weeping, and their several shout."
80,CANTO XXVI,
81,CANTO XXVI,"Again drew near my side the very same,"
82,CANTO XXVI,"Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks"
83,CANTO XXVI,"Mark'd eagerness to listen.  I, who twice"
84,CANTO XXVI,"Their will had noted, spake: ""O spirits secure,"
85,CANTO XXVI,"Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end!"
86,CANTO XXVI,"My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,"
87,CANTO XXVI,"Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed"
88,CANTO XXVI,"With blood, and sinew-strung.  That I no more"
89,CANTO XXVI,"May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft."
90,CANTO XXVI,"There is a dame on high, who wind for us"
91,CANTO XXVI,"This grace, by which my mortal through your realm"
92,CANTO XXVI,I bear.  But may your utmost wish soon meet
93,CANTO XXVI,"Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,"
94,CANTO XXVI,"Fullest of love, and of most ample space,"
95,CANTO XXVI,"Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page"
96,CANTO XXVI,"Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,"
97,CANTO XXVI,"And what this multitude, that at your backs"
98,CANTO XXVI,"Have past behind us.""  As one, mountain-bred,"
99,CANTO XXVI,"Rugged and clownish, if some city's walls"
100,CANTO XXVI,"He chance to enter, round him stares agape,"
101,CANTO XXVI,Confounded and struck dumb; e'en such appear'd
102,CANTO XXVI,"Each spirit.  But when rid of that amaze,"
103,CANTO XXVI,(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)
104,CANTO XXVI,"He, who before had question'd, thus resum'd:"
105,CANTO XXVI,"""O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak'st"
106,CANTO XXVI,"Experience of our limits, in thy bark!"
107,CANTO XXVI,"Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,"
108,CANTO XXVI,"For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard"
109,CANTO XXVI,"The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him.  Hence their cry"
110,CANTO XXVI,"Of 'Sodom,' as they parted, to rebuke"
111,CANTO XXVI,"Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame."
112,CANTO XXVI,"Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,"
113,CANTO XXVI,"Because the law of human kind we broke,"
114,CANTO XXVI,"Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,"
115,CANTO XXVI,"Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace"
116,CANTO XXVI,"Record the name of her, by whom the beast"
117,CANTO XXVI,In bestial tire was acted.  Now our deeds
118,CANTO XXVI,"Thou know'st, and how we sinn'd.  If thou by name"
119,CANTO XXVI,"Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now"
120,CANTO XXVI,"To tell so much, nor can I.  Of myself"
121,CANTO XXVI,"Learn what thou wishest.  Guinicelli I,"
122,CANTO XXVI,"Who having truly sorrow'd ere my last,"
123,CANTO XXVI,"Already cleanse me.""  With such pious joy,"
124,CANTO XXVI,As the two sons upon their mother gaz'd
125,CANTO XXVI,"From sad Lycurgus rescu'd, such my joy"
126,CANTO XXVI,(Save that I more represt it) when I heard
127,CANTO XXVI,"From his own lips the name of him pronounc'd,"
128,CANTO XXVI,"Who was a father to me, and to those"
129,CANTO XXVI,"My betters, who have ever us'd the sweet"
130,CANTO XXVI,And pleasant rhymes of love.  So nought I heard
131,CANTO XXVI,"Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,"
132,CANTO XXVI,"Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,"
133,CANTO XXVI,Approach'd not nearer.  When my eyes were fed
134,CANTO XXVI,"By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,"
135,CANTO XXVI,"As forces credence, I devoted me"
136,CANTO XXVI,Unto his service wholly.  In reply
137,CANTO XXVI,"He thus bespake me: ""What from thee I hear"
138,CANTO XXVI,"Is grav'd so deeply on my mind, the waves"
139,CANTO XXVI,"Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make"
140,CANTO XXVI,A whit less lively.  But as now thy oath
141,CANTO XXVI,"Has seal'd the truth, declare what cause impels"
142,CANTO XXVI,"That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray."""
143,CANTO XXVI,
144,CANTO XXVI,"""Those dulcet lays,"" I answer'd, ""which, as long"
145,CANTO XXVI,"As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,"
146,CANTO XXVI,"Shall make us love the very ink that trac'd them."""
147,CANTO XXVI,
148,CANTO XXVI,"""Brother!""  he cried, and pointed at a shade"
149,CANTO XXVI,"Before him, ""there is one, whose mother speech"
150,CANTO XXVI,Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.
151,CANTO XXVI,He in love ditties and the tales of prose
152,CANTO XXVI,"Without a rival stands, and lets the fools"
153,CANTO XXVI,"Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges"
154,CANTO XXVI,O'ertops him.  Rumour and the popular voice
155,CANTO XXVI,"They look to more than truth, and so confirm"
156,CANTO XXVI,"Opinion, ere by art or reason taught."
157,CANTO XXVI,Thus many of the elder time cried up
158,CANTO XXVI,"Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth"
159,CANTO XXVI,By strength of numbers vanquish'd.  If thou own
160,CANTO XXVI,"So ample privilege, as to have gain'd"
161,CANTO XXVI,"Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ"
162,CANTO XXVI,"Is Abbot of the college, say to him"
163,CANTO XXVI,"One paternoster for me, far as needs"
164,CANTO XXVI,"For dwellers in this world, where power to sin"
165,CANTO XXVI,"No longer tempts us.""  Haply to make way"
166,CANTO XXVI,"For one, that follow'd next, when that was said,"
167,CANTO XXVI,"He vanish'd through the fire, as through the wave"
168,CANTO XXVI,"A fish, that glances diving to the deep."
169,CANTO XXVI,
170,CANTO XXVI,"I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew"
171,CANTO XXVI,"A little onward, and besought his name,"
172,CANTO XXVI,"For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room."
173,CANTO XXVI,"He frankly thus began: ""Thy courtesy"
174,CANTO XXVI,"So wins on me, I have nor power nor will"
175,CANTO XXVI,"To hide me.  I am Arnault; and with songs,"
176,CANTO XXVI,"Sorely lamenting for my folly past,"
177,CANTO XXVI,"Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see"
178,CANTO XXVI,"The day, I hope for, smiling in my view."
179,CANTO XXVI,I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
180,CANTO XXVI,"Unto the summit of the scale, in time"
181,CANTO XXVI,"Remember ye my suff'rings.""  With such words"
182,CANTO XXVI,He disappear'd in the refining flame.
183,CANTO XXVI,
184,CANTO XXVI,
185,CANTO XXVI,
186,CANTO XXVI,
187,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
188,CANTO XXVII,
189,CANTO XXVII,"Now was the sun so station'd, as when first"
190,CANTO XXVII,"His early radiance quivers on the heights,"
191,CANTO XXVII,"Where stream'd his Maker's blood, while Libra hangs"
192,CANTO XXVII,"Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires"
193,CANTO XXVII,Meridian flash on Ganges' yellow tide.
194,CANTO XXVII,
195,CANTO XXVII,"So day was sinking, when the' angel of God"
196,CANTO XXVII,Appear'd before us.  Joy was in his mien.
197,CANTO XXVII,"Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,"
198,CANTO XXVII,"And with a voice, whose lively clearness far"
199,CANTO XXVII,"Surpass'd our human, ""Blessed are the pure"
200,CANTO XXVII,"In heart,"" he Sang: then near him as we came,"
201,CANTO XXVII,"""Go ye not further, holy spirits!""  he cried,"
202,CANTO XXVII,"""Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list"
203,CANTO XXVII,"Attentive to the song ye hear from thence."""
204,CANTO XXVII,
205,CANTO XXVII,"I, when I heard his saying, was as one"
206,CANTO XXVII,"Laid in the grave.  My hands together clasp'd,"
207,CANTO XXVII,"And upward stretching, on the fire I look'd,"
208,CANTO XXVII,And busy fancy conjur'd up the forms
209,CANTO XXVII,Erewhile beheld alive consum'd in flames.
210,CANTO XXVII,
211,CANTO XXVII,Th' escorting spirits turn'd with gentle looks
212,CANTO XXVII,"Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: ""My son,"
213,CANTO XXVII,"Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death."
214,CANTO XXVII,"Remember thee, remember thee, if I"
215,CANTO XXVII,Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come
216,CANTO XXVII,"More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?"
217,CANTO XXVII,Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame
218,CANTO XXVII,"A thousand years contain'd thee, from thy head"
219,CANTO XXVII,"No hair should perish.  If thou doubt my truth,"
220,CANTO XXVII,"Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture's hem"
221,CANTO XXVII,"Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief."
222,CANTO XXVII,"Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside."
223,CANTO XXVII,"Turn hither, and come onward undismay'd."""
224,CANTO XXVII,"I still, though conscience urg'd' no step advanc'd."
225,CANTO XXVII,
226,CANTO XXVII,"When still he saw me fix'd and obstinate,"
227,CANTO XXVII,"Somewhat disturb'd he cried: ""Mark now, my son,"
228,CANTO XXVII,From Beatrice thou art by this wall
229,CANTO XXVII,"Divided.""  As at Thisbe's name the eye"
230,CANTO XXVII,Of Pyramus was open'd (when life ebb'd
231,CANTO XXVII,"Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,"
232,CANTO XXVII,While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd
233,CANTO XXVII,"To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard"
234,CANTO XXVII,"The name, that springs forever in my breast."
235,CANTO XXVII,
236,CANTO XXVII,"He shook his forehead; and, ""How long,"" he said,"
237,CANTO XXVII,"""Linger we now?""  then smil'd, as one would smile"
238,CANTO XXVII,"Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields."
239,CANTO XXVII,Into the fire before me then he walk'd;
240,CANTO XXVII,"And Statius, who erewhile no little space"
241,CANTO XXVII,"Had parted us, he pray'd to come behind."
242,CANTO XXVII,
243,CANTO XXVII,I would have cast me into molten glass
244,CANTO XXVII,"To cool me, when I enter'd; so intense"
245,CANTO XXVII,"Rag'd the conflagrant mass.  The sire belov'd,"
246,CANTO XXVII,"To comfort me, as he proceeded, still"
247,CANTO XXVII,"Of Beatrice talk'd.  ""Her eyes,"" saith he,"
248,CANTO XXVII,"""E'en now I seem to view.""  From the other side"
249,CANTO XXVII,"A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice"
250,CANTO XXVII,"Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,"
251,CANTO XXVII,"There where the path led upward.  ""Come,"" we heard,"
252,CANTO XXVII,"""Come, blessed of my Father.""  Such the sounds,"
253,CANTO XXVII,"That hail'd us from within a light, which shone"
254,CANTO XXVII,"So radiant, I could not endure the view."
255,CANTO XXVII,"""The sun,"" it added, ""hastes: and evening comes."
256,CANTO XXVII,Delay not: ere the western sky is hung
257,CANTO XXVII,"With blackness, strive ye for the pass.""  Our way"
258,CANTO XXVII,"Upright within the rock arose, and fac'd"
259,CANTO XXVII,"Such part of heav'n, that from before my steps"
260,CANTO XXVII,The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.
261,CANTO XXVII,
262,CANTO XXVII,"Nor many stairs were overpass, when now"
263,CANTO XXVII,By fading of the shadow we perceiv'd
264,CANTO XXVII,The sun behind us couch'd: and ere one face
265,CANTO XXVII,Of darkness o'er its measureless expanse
266,CANTO XXVII,"Involv'd th' horizon, and the night her lot"
267,CANTO XXVII,"Held individual, each of us had made"
268,CANTO XXVII,"A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,"
269,CANTO XXVII,"Had fail'd us, by the nature of that mount"
270,CANTO XXVII,"Forbidden further travel.  As the goats,"
271,CANTO XXVII,That late have skipp'd and wanton'd rapidly
272,CANTO XXVII,"Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en"
273,CANTO XXVII,"Their supper on the herb, now silent lie"
274,CANTO XXVII,"And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,"
275,CANTO XXVII,While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans
276,CANTO XXVII,"Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:"
277,CANTO XXVII,"And as the swain, that lodges out all night"
278,CANTO XXVII,"In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey"
279,CANTO XXVII,"Disperse them; even so all three abode,"
280,CANTO XXVII,"I as a goat and as the shepherds they,"
281,CANTO XXVII,Close pent on either side by shelving rock.
282,CANTO XXVII,
283,CANTO XXVII,A little glimpse of sky was seen above;
284,CANTO XXVII,Yet by that little I beheld the stars
285,CANTO XXVII,In magnitude and rustle shining forth
286,CANTO XXVII,"With more than wonted glory.  As I lay,"
287,CANTO XXVII,"Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,"
288,CANTO XXVII,"Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft"
289,CANTO XXVII,"Tidings of future hap.  About the hour,"
290,CANTO XXVII,"As I believe, when Venus from the east"
291,CANTO XXVII,"First lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb"
292,CANTO XXVII,"Seems always glowing with the fire of love,"
293,CANTO XXVII,"A lady young and beautiful, I dream'd,"
294,CANTO XXVII,"Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she came,"
295,CANTO XXVII,Methought I saw her ever and anon
296,CANTO XXVII,Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:
297,CANTO XXVII,"""Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,"
298,CANTO XXVII,That I am Leah: for my brow to weave
299,CANTO XXVII,"A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply."
300,CANTO XXVII,"To please me at the crystal mirror, here"
301,CANTO XXVII,"I deck me.  But my sister Rachel, she"
302,CANTO XXVII,"Before her glass abides the livelong day,"
303,CANTO XXVII,"Her radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less,"
304,CANTO XXVII,Than I with this delightful task.  Her joy
305,CANTO XXVII,"In contemplation, as in labour mine."""
306,CANTO XXVII,
307,CANTO XXVII,"And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks"
308,CANTO XXVII,"More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he"
309,CANTO XXVII,"Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,"
310,CANTO XXVII,"Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled"
311,CANTO XXVII,My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide
312,CANTO XXVII,"Already risen.  ""That delicious fruit,"
313,CANTO XXVII,Which through so many a branch the zealous care
314,CANTO XXVII,"Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day"
315,CANTO XXVII,"Appease thy hunger.""  Such the words I heard"
316,CANTO XXVII,From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard
317,CANTO XXVII,So pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight
318,CANTO XXVII,"Desire so grew upon desire to mount,"
319,CANTO XXVII,Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
320,CANTO XXVII,Increasing for my flight.  When we had run
321,CANTO XXVII,"O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,"
322,CANTO XXVII,"As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd"
323,CANTO XXVII,"His eyes, and thus he spake: ""Both fires, my son,"
324,CANTO XXVII,"The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,"
325,CANTO XXVII,"And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken"
326,CANTO XXVII,No further reaches.  I with skill and art
327,CANTO XXVII,Thus far have drawn thee.  Now thy pleasure take
328,CANTO XXVII,"For guide.  Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,"
329,CANTO XXVII,"O'ercome the straighter.  Lo! the sun, that darts"
330,CANTO XXVII,"His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,"
331,CANTO XXVII,"The arboreta and flowers, which of itself"
332,CANTO XXVII,This land pours forth profuse!  Will those bright eyes
333,CANTO XXVII,"With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste"
334,CANTO XXVII,"To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,"
335,CANTO XXVII,Or wander where thou wilt.  Expect no more
336,CANTO XXVII,"Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,"
337,CANTO XXVII,"Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,"
338,CANTO XXVII,"Discreet, judicious.  To distrust thy sense"
339,CANTO XXVII,Were henceforth error.  I invest thee then
340,CANTO XXVII,"With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself."""

346,CANTO XXVIII,
347,CANTO XXVIII,"Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade"
348,CANTO XXVIII,With lively greenness the new-springing day
349,CANTO XXVIII,"Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and search"
350,CANTO XXVIII,"Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,"
351,CANTO XXVIII,Along the champain leisurely my way
352,CANTO XXVIII,"Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all sides"
353,CANTO XXVIII,"Delicious odour breath'd.  A pleasant air,"
354,CANTO XXVIII,"That intermitted never, never veer'd,"
355,CANTO XXVIII,"Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind"
356,CANTO XXVIII,"Of softest influence: at which the sprays,"
357,CANTO XXVIII,"Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part"
358,CANTO XXVIII,"Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,"
359,CANTO XXVIII,"Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still"
360,CANTO XXVIII,Upon their top the feather'd quiristers
361,CANTO XXVIII,"Applied their wonted art, and with full joy"
362,CANTO XXVIII,"Welcom'd those hours of prime, and warbled shrill"
363,CANTO XXVIII,"Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays"
364,CANTO XXVIII,"inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,"
365,CANTO XXVIII,Along the piney forests on the shore
366,CANTO XXVIII,"Of Chiassi, rolls the gath'ring melody,"
367,CANTO XXVIII,When Eolus hath from his cavern loos'd
368,CANTO XXVIII,"The dripping south.  Already had my steps,"
369,CANTO XXVIII,"Though slow, so far into that ancient wood"
370,CANTO XXVIII,"Transported me, I could not ken the place"
371,CANTO XXVIII,"Where I had enter'd, when behold! my path"
372,CANTO XXVIII,"Was bounded by a rill, which to the left"
373,CANTO XXVIII,"With little rippling waters bent the grass,"
374,CANTO XXVIII,That issued from its brink.  On earth no wave
375,CANTO XXVIII,"How clean soe'er, that would not seem to have"
376,CANTO XXVIII,"Some mixture in itself, compar'd with this,"
377,CANTO XXVIII,"Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll'd,"
378,CANTO XXVIII,"Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne'er"
379,CANTO XXVIII,Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.
380,CANTO XXVIII,
381,CANTO XXVIII,My feet advanc'd not; but my wond'ring eyes
382,CANTO XXVIII,"Pass'd onward, o'er the streamlet, to survey"
383,CANTO XXVIII,"The tender May-bloom, flush'd through many a hue,"
384,CANTO XXVIII,"In prodigal variety: and there,"
385,CANTO XXVIII,"As object, rising suddenly to view,"
386,CANTO XXVIII,That from our bosom every thought beside
387,CANTO XXVIII,"With the rare marvel chases, I beheld"
388,CANTO XXVIII,"A lady all alone, who, singing, went,"
389,CANTO XXVIII,"And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way"
390,CANTO XXVIII,"Was all o'er painted.  ""Lady beautiful!"
391,CANTO XXVIII,"Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,"
392,CANTO XXVIII,"Are worthy of our trust), with love's own beam"
393,CANTO XXVIII,"Dost warm thee,"" thus to her my speech I fram'd:"
394,CANTO XXVIII,"""Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend"
395,CANTO XXVIII,"Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song."
396,CANTO XXVIII,"Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,"
397,CANTO XXVIII,I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd
398,CANTO XXVIII,"Proserpine, in that season, when her child"
399,CANTO XXVIII,"The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring."""
400,CANTO XXVIII,
401,CANTO XXVIII,"As when a lady, turning in the dance,"
402,CANTO XXVIII,"Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce"
403,CANTO XXVIII,One step before the other to the ground;
404,CANTO XXVIII,Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
405,CANTO XXVIII,"Thus turn'd she at my suit, most maiden-like,"
406,CANTO XXVIII,"Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,"
407,CANTO XXVIII,That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.
408,CANTO XXVIII,Arriving where the limped waters now
409,CANTO XXVIII,"Lav'd the green sward, her eyes she deign'd to raise,"
410,CANTO XXVIII,"That shot such splendour on me, as I ween"
411,CANTO XXVIII,"Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's, when her son"
412,CANTO XXVIII,Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.
413,CANTO XXVIII,Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil'd
414,CANTO XXVIII,through her graceful fingers shifted still
415,CANTO XXVIII,"The intermingling dyes, which without seed"
416,CANTO XXVIII,That lofty land unbosoms.  By the stream
417,CANTO XXVIII,Three paces only were we sunder'd: yet
418,CANTO XXVIII,"The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er,"
419,CANTO XXVIII,(A curb for ever to the pride of man)
420,CANTO XXVIII,Was by Leander not more hateful held
421,CANTO XXVIII,"For floating, with inhospitable wave"
422,CANTO XXVIII,"'Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me"
423,CANTO XXVIII,"That flood, because it gave no passage thence."
424,CANTO XXVIII,
425,CANTO XXVIII,"""Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,"
426,CANTO XXVIII,"That cradled human nature in its birth,"
427,CANTO XXVIII,"Wond'ring, ye not without suspicion view"
428,CANTO XXVIII,"My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,"
429,CANTO XXVIII,"'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,' will give ye light,"
430,CANTO XXVIII,"Which may uncloud your minds.  And thou, who stand'st"
431,CANTO XXVIII,"The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,"
432,CANTO XXVIII,Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I
433,CANTO XXVIII,"Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine."""
434,CANTO XXVIII,
435,CANTO XXVIII,"She spake; and I replied: ""I know not how"
436,CANTO XXVIII,To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
437,CANTO XXVIII,"Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard"
438,CANTO XXVIII,"Of opposite report.""  She answering thus:"
439,CANTO XXVIII,"""I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,"
440,CANTO XXVIII,Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud
441,CANTO XXVIII,"That hath enwraps thee.  The First Good, whose joy"
442,CANTO XXVIII,"Is only in himself, created man"
443,CANTO XXVIII,"For happiness, and gave this goodly place,"
444,CANTO XXVIII,His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.
445,CANTO XXVIII,"Favour'd thus highly, through his own defect"
446,CANTO XXVIII,"He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,"
447,CANTO XXVIII,"And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang'd"
448,CANTO XXVIII,Laughter unblam'd and ever-new delight.
449,CANTO XXVIII,"That vapours none, exhal'd from earth beneath,"
450,CANTO XXVIII,"Or from the waters (which, wherever heat"
451,CANTO XXVIII,"Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far"
452,CANTO XXVIII,"To vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose"
453,CANTO XXVIII,"So high toward the heav'n, nor fears the rage"
454,CANTO XXVIII,"Of elements contending, from that part"
455,CANTO XXVIII,"Exempted, where the gate his limit bars."
456,CANTO XXVIII,Because the circumambient air throughout
457,CANTO XXVIII,"With its first impulse circles still, unless"
458,CANTO XXVIII,Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;
459,CANTO XXVIII,"Upon the summit, which on every side"
460,CANTO XXVIII,To visitation of th' impassive air
461,CANTO XXVIII,"Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes"
462,CANTO XXVIII,Beneath its sway th' umbrageous wood resound:
463,CANTO XXVIII,"And in the shaken plant such power resides,"
464,CANTO XXVIII,That it impregnates with its efficacy
465,CANTO XXVIII,"The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume"
466,CANTO XXVIII,That wafted flies abroad; and th' other land
467,CANTO XXVIII,"Receiving (as 't is worthy in itself,"
468,CANTO XXVIII,"Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,"
469,CANTO XXVIII,And from its womb produces many a tree
470,CANTO XXVIII,"Of various virtue.  This when thou hast heard,"
471,CANTO XXVIII,"The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth"
472,CANTO XXVIII,Some plant without apparent seed be found
473,CANTO XXVIII,"To fix its fibrous stem.  And further learn,"
474,CANTO XXVIII,"That with prolific foison of all seeds,"
475,CANTO XXVIII,"This holy plain is fill'd, and in itself"
476,CANTO XXVIII,Bears fruit that ne'er was pluck'd on other soil.
477,CANTO XXVIII,
478,CANTO XXVIII,"""The water, thou behold'st, springs not from vein,"
479,CANTO XXVIII,"As stream, that intermittently repairs"
480,CANTO XXVIII,"And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth"
481,CANTO XXVIII,"From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;"
482,CANTO XXVIII,"And by the will omnific, full supply"
483,CANTO XXVIII,Feeds whatsoe'er On either side it pours;
484,CANTO XXVIII,On this devolv'd with power to take away
485,CANTO XXVIII,"Remembrance of offence, on that to bring"
486,CANTO XXVIII,Remembrance back of every good deed done.
487,CANTO XXVIII,From whence its name of Lethe on this part;
488,CANTO XXVIII,On th' other Eunoe: both of which must first
489,CANTO XXVIII,Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding
490,CANTO XXVIII,All flavours else.  Albeit thy thirst may now
491,CANTO XXVIII,"Be well contented, if I here break off,"
492,CANTO XXVIII,No more revealing: yet a corollary
493,CANTO XXVIII,I freely give beside: nor deem my words
494,CANTO XXVIII,"Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass"
495,CANTO XXVIII,"The stretch of promise.  They, whose verse of yore"
496,CANTO XXVIII,"The golden age recorded and its bliss,"
497,CANTO XXVIII,"On the Parnassian mountain, of this place"
498,CANTO XXVIII,"Perhaps had dream'd.  Here was man guiltless, here"
499,CANTO XXVIII,"Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this"
500,CANTO XXVIII,"The far-fam'd nectar.""  Turning to the bards,"
501,CANTO XXVIII,"When she had ceas'd, I noted in their looks"
502,CANTO XXVIII,A smile at her conclusion; then my face
503,CANTO XXVIII,Again directed to the lovely dame.
504,CANTO XXVIII,
505,CANTO XXVIII,
506,CANTO XXVIII,
507,CANTO XXVIII,
508,CANTO XXIX,CANTO XXIX
509,CANTO XXIX,
510,CANTO XXIX,"Singing, as if enamour'd, she resum'd"
511,CANTO XXIX,"And clos'd the song, with ""Blessed they whose sins"
512,CANTO XXIX,"Are cover'd.""  Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp'd"
513,CANTO XXIX,"Singly across the sylvan shadows, one"
514,CANTO XXIX,"Eager to view and one to 'scape the sun,"
515,CANTO XXIX,"So mov'd she on, against the current, up"
516,CANTO XXIX,"The verdant rivage.  I, her mincing step"
517,CANTO XXIX,"Observing, with as tardy step pursued."
518,CANTO XXIX,
519,CANTO XXIX,"Between us not an hundred paces trod,"
520,CANTO XXIX,"The bank, on each side bending equally,"
521,CANTO XXIX,Gave me to face the orient.  Nor our way
522,CANTO XXIX,"Far onward brought us, when to me at once"
523,CANTO XXIX,"She turn'd, and cried: ""My brother! look and hearken."""
524,CANTO XXIX,And lo! a sudden lustre ran across
525,CANTO XXIX,"Through the great forest on all parts, so bright"
526,CANTO XXIX,I doubted whether lightning were abroad;
527,CANTO XXIX,"But that expiring ever in the spleen,"
528,CANTO XXIX,"That doth unfold it, and this during still"
529,CANTO XXIX,"And waxing still in splendor, made me question"
530,CANTO XXIX,What it might be: and a sweet melody
531,CANTO XXIX,Ran through the luminous air.  Then did I chide
532,CANTO XXIX,With warrantable zeal the hardihood
533,CANTO XXIX,"Of our first parent, for that there were earth"
534,CANTO XXIX,"Stood in obedience to the heav'ns, she only,"
535,CANTO XXIX,"Woman, the creature of an hour, endur'd not"
536,CANTO XXIX,Restraint of any veil: which had she borne
537,CANTO XXIX,"Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,"
538,CANTO XXIX,"Had from the first, and long time since, been mine."
539,CANTO XXIX,
540,CANTO XXIX,While through that wilderness of primy sweets
541,CANTO XXIX,"That never fade, suspense I walk'd, and yet"
542,CANTO XXIX,"Expectant of beatitude more high,"
543,CANTO XXIX,"Before us, like a blazing fire, the air"
544,CANTO XXIX,"Under the green boughs glow'd; and, for a song,"
545,CANTO XXIX,Distinct the sound of melody was heard.
546,CANTO XXIX,
547,CANTO XXIX,O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes
548,CANTO XXIX,"If e'er I suffer'd hunger, cold and watching,"
549,CANTO XXIX,Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.
550,CANTO XXIX,Now through my breast let Helicon his stream
551,CANTO XXIX,Pour copious; and Urania with her choir
552,CANTO XXIX,Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds
553,CANTO XXIX,Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.
554,CANTO XXIX,
555,CANTO XXIX,"Onward a space, what seem'd seven trees of gold,"
556,CANTO XXIX,The intervening distance to mine eye
557,CANTO XXIX,Falsely presented; but when I was come
558,CANTO XXIX,"So near them, that no lineament was lost"
559,CANTO XXIX,"Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen"
560,CANTO XXIX,"Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,"
561,CANTO XXIX,"Then did the faculty, that ministers"
562,CANTO XXIX,"Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold"
563,CANTO XXIX,"Distinguish, and it th' singing trace the sound"
564,CANTO XXIX,"""Hosanna.""  Above, their beauteous garniture"
565,CANTO XXIX,"Flam'd with more ample lustre, than the moon"
566,CANTO XXIX,Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.
567,CANTO XXIX,
568,CANTO XXIX,I turn'd me full of wonder to my guide;
569,CANTO XXIX,And he did answer with a countenance
570,CANTO XXIX,Charg'd with no less amazement: whence my view
571,CANTO XXIX,"Reverted to those lofty things, which came"
572,CANTO XXIX,"So slowly moving towards us, that the bride"
573,CANTO XXIX,Would have outstript them on her bridal day.
574,CANTO XXIX,
575,CANTO XXIX,"The lady called aloud: ""Why thus yet burns"
576,CANTO XXIX,"Affection in thee for these living, lights,"
577,CANTO XXIX,"And dost not look on that which follows them?"""
578,CANTO XXIX,
579,CANTO XXIX,"I straightway mark'd a tribe behind them walk,"
580,CANTO XXIX,"As if attendant on their leaders, cloth'd"
581,CANTO XXIX,"With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth"
582,CANTO XXIX,"Was never.  On my left, the wat'ry gleam"
583,CANTO XXIX,"Borrow'd, and gave me back, when there I look'd."
584,CANTO XXIX,"As in a mirror, my left side portray'd."
585,CANTO XXIX,
586,CANTO XXIX,When I had chosen on the river's edge
587,CANTO XXIX,"Such station, that the distance of the stream"
588,CANTO XXIX,Alone did separate me; there I stay'd
589,CANTO XXIX,"My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld"
590,CANTO XXIX,"The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,"
591,CANTO XXIX,The air behind them painted as with trail
592,CANTO XXIX,Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark'd
593,CANTO XXIX,"All those sev'n listed colours, whence the sun"
594,CANTO XXIX,"Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone."
595,CANTO XXIX,These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
596,CANTO XXIX,"My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,"
597,CANTO XXIX,Parted the outermost.  Beneath a sky
598,CANTO XXIX,"So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,"
599,CANTO XXIX,"By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown'd."
600,CANTO XXIX,
601,CANTO XXIX,"All sang one song: ""Blessed be thou among"
602,CANTO XXIX,The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness
603,CANTO XXIX,"Blessed for ever!""  After that the flowers,"
604,CANTO XXIX,"And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,"
605,CANTO XXIX,Were free from that elected race; as light
606,CANTO XXIX,"In heav'n doth second light, came after them"
607,CANTO XXIX,"Four animals, each crown'd with verdurous leaf."
608,CANTO XXIX,"With six wings each was plum'd, the plumage full"
609,CANTO XXIX,"Of eyes, and th' eyes of Argus would be such,"
610,CANTO XXIX,"Were they endued with life.  Reader, more rhymes"
611,CANTO XXIX,Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:
612,CANTO XXIX,"For other need no straitens, that in this"
613,CANTO XXIX,I may not give my bounty room.  But read
614,CANTO XXIX,"Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north"
615,CANTO XXIX,"How he beheld them come by Chebar's flood,"
616,CANTO XXIX,"In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such"
617,CANTO XXIX,"As thou shalt find them character'd by him,"
618,CANTO XXIX,"Here were they; save as to the pennons; there,"
619,CANTO XXIX,"From him departing, John accords with me."
620,CANTO XXIX,
621,CANTO XXIX,"The space, surrounded by the four, enclos'd"
622,CANTO XXIX,A car triumphal: on two wheels it came
623,CANTO XXIX,Drawn at a Gryphon's neck; and he above
624,CANTO XXIX,"Stretch'd either wing uplifted, 'tween the midst"
625,CANTO XXIX,"And the three listed hues, on each side three;"
626,CANTO XXIX,So that the wings did cleave or injure none;
627,CANTO XXIX,"And out of sight they rose.  The members, far"
628,CANTO XXIX,"As he was bird, were golden; white the rest"
629,CANTO XXIX,With vermeil intervein'd.  So beautiful
630,CANTO XXIX,"A car in Rome ne'er grac'd Augustus pomp,"
631,CANTO XXIX,Or Africanus': e'en the sun's itself
632,CANTO XXIX,"Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun"
633,CANTO XXIX,"Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell"
634,CANTO XXIX,"At Tellus' pray'r devout, by the just doom"
635,CANTO XXIX,Mysterious of all-seeing Jove.  Three nymphs
636,CANTO XXIX,"at the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;"
637,CANTO XXIX,"The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce"
638,CANTO XXIX,Been known within a furnace of clear flame:
639,CANTO XXIX,"The next did look, as if the flesh and bones"
640,CANTO XXIX,Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem'd the third.
641,CANTO XXIX,
642,CANTO XXIX,"Now seem'd the white to lead, the ruddy now;"
643,CANTO XXIX,"And from her song who led, the others took"
644,CANTO XXIX,"Their treasure, swift or slow.  At th' other wheel,"
645,CANTO XXIX,"A band quaternion, each in purple clad,"
646,CANTO XXIX,"Advanc'd with festal step, as of them one"
647,CANTO XXIX,"The rest conducted, one, upon whose front"
648,CANTO XXIX,"Three eyes were seen.  In rear of all this group,"
649,CANTO XXIX,"Two old men I beheld, dissimilar"
650,CANTO XXIX,"In raiment, but in port and gesture like,"
651,CANTO XXIX,Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one
652,CANTO XXIX,Did show himself some favour'd counsellor
653,CANTO XXIX,"Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made"
654,CANTO XXIX,To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.
655,CANTO XXIX,"His fellow mark'd an opposite intent,"
656,CANTO XXIX,"Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,"
657,CANTO XXIX,"E'en as I view'd it with the flood between,"
658,CANTO XXIX,"Appall'd me.  Next four others I beheld,"
659,CANTO XXIX,"Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,"
660,CANTO XXIX,"One single old man, sleeping, as he came,"
661,CANTO XXIX,"With a shrewd visage.  And these seven, each"
662,CANTO XXIX,"Like the first troop were habited, but wore"
663,CANTO XXIX,No braid of lilies on their temples wreath'd.
664,CANTO XXIX,"Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,"
665,CANTO XXIX,"A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,"
666,CANTO XXIX,That they were all on fire above their brow.
667,CANTO XXIX,
668,CANTO XXIX,"Whenas the car was o'er against me, straight."
669,CANTO XXIX,"Was heard a thund'ring, at whose voice it seem'd"
670,CANTO XXIX,"The chosen multitude were stay'd; for there,"
671,CANTO XXIX,"With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt."
672,CANTO XXIX,
673,CANTO XXIX,
674,CANTO XXIX,
675,CANTO XXIX,
676,CANTO XXX,CANTO XXX
677,CANTO XXX,
678,CANTO XXX,"Soon as the polar light, which never knows"
679,CANTO XXX,"Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil"
680,CANTO XXX,"Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament"
681,CANTO XXX,"Of the first heav'n, to duty each one there"
682,CANTO XXX,"Safely convoying, as that lower doth"
683,CANTO XXX,"The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix'd;"
684,CANTO XXX,"Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van"
685,CANTO XXX,"Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,"
686,CANTO XXX,"Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:"
687,CANTO XXX,"And one, as if commission'd from above,"
688,CANTO XXX,In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:
689,CANTO XXX,"""Come, spouse, from Libanus!"" and all the rest"
690,CANTO XXX,Took up the song--At the last audit so
691,CANTO XXX,"The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each"
692,CANTO XXX,"Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,"
693,CANTO XXX,"As, on the sacred litter, at the voice"
694,CANTO XXX,"Authoritative of that elder, sprang"
695,CANTO XXX,A hundred ministers and messengers
696,CANTO XXX,"Of life eternal.  ""Blessed thou! who com'st!"""
697,CANTO XXX,"And, ""O,"" they cried, ""from full hands scatter ye"
698,CANTO XXX,"Unwith'ring lilies;"" and, so saying, cast"
699,CANTO XXX,Flowers over head and round them on all sides.
700,CANTO XXX,
701,CANTO XXX,"I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,"
702,CANTO XXX,"The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky"
703,CANTO XXX,"Oppos'd, one deep and beautiful serene,"
704,CANTO XXX,"And the sun's face so shaded, and with mists"
705,CANTO XXX,"Attemper'd at lids rising, that the eye"
706,CANTO XXX,Long while endur'd the sight: thus in a cloud
707,CANTO XXX,"Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,"
708,CANTO XXX,"And down, within and outside of the car,"
709,CANTO XXX,"Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath'd,"
710,CANTO XXX,"A virgin in my view appear'd, beneath"
711,CANTO XXX,"Green mantle, rob'd in hue of living flame:"
712,CANTO XXX,
713,CANTO XXX,"And o'er my Spirit, that in former days"
714,CANTO XXX,"Within her presence had abode so long,"
715,CANTO XXX,No shudd'ring terror crept.  Mine eyes no more
716,CANTO XXX,Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her
717,CANTO XXX,"A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,"
718,CANTO XXX,The power of ancient love was strong within me.
719,CANTO XXX,
720,CANTO XXX,"No sooner on my vision streaming, smote"
721,CANTO XXX,"The heav'nly influence, which years past, and e'en"
722,CANTO XXX,"In childhood, thrill'd me, than towards Virgil I"
723,CANTO XXX,"Turn'd me to leftward, panting, like a babe,"
724,CANTO XXX,"That flees for refuge to his mother's breast,"
725,CANTO XXX,If aught have terrified or work'd him woe:
726,CANTO XXX,"And would have cried: ""There is no dram of blood,"
727,CANTO XXX,That doth not quiver in me.  The old flame
728,CANTO XXX,"Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:"""
729,CANTO XXX,"But Virgil had bereav'd us of himself,"
730,CANTO XXX,"Virgil, my best-lov'd father; Virgil, he"
731,CANTO XXX,"To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,"
732,CANTO XXX,"All, our prime mother lost, avail'd to save"
733,CANTO XXX,My undew'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears.
734,CANTO XXX,
735,CANTO XXX,"""Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,"
736,CANTO XXX,Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge
737,CANTO XXX,"Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that."""
738,CANTO XXX,
739,CANTO XXX,"As to the prow or stern, some admiral"
740,CANTO XXX,"Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,"
741,CANTO XXX,When 'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;
742,CANTO XXX,"Thus on the left side of the car I saw,"
743,CANTO XXX,"(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,"
744,CANTO XXX,Which here I am compell'd to register)
745,CANTO XXX,"The virgin station'd, who before appeared"
746,CANTO XXX,Veil'd in that festive shower angelical.
747,CANTO XXX,
748,CANTO XXX,"Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;"
749,CANTO XXX,"Though from her brow the veil descending, bound"
750,CANTO XXX,"With foliage of Minerva, suffer'd not"
751,CANTO XXX,That I beheld her clearly; then with act
752,CANTO XXX,"Full royal, still insulting o'er her thrall,"
753,CANTO XXX,"Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back"
754,CANTO XXX,"The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:"
755,CANTO XXX,"""Observe me well.  I am, in sooth, I am"
756,CANTO XXX,Beatrice.  What! and hast thou deign'd at last
757,CANTO XXX,"Approach the mountainnewest not, O man!"
758,CANTO XXX,"Thy happiness is whole?""  Down fell mine eyes"
759,CANTO XXX,"On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,"
760,CANTO XXX,"Recoil'd, and sought the greensward: such a weight"
761,CANTO XXX,Of shame was on my forehead.  With a mien
762,CANTO XXX,"Of that stern majesty, which doth surround"
763,CANTO XXX,"mother's presence to her awe-struck child,"
764,CANTO XXX,She look'd; a flavour of such bitterness
765,CANTO XXX,Was mingled in her pity.  There her words
766,CANTO XXX,"Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:"
767,CANTO XXX,"""In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:"""
768,CANTO XXX,"But went no farther than, ""Thou Lord, hast set"
769,CANTO XXX,"My feet in ample room.""  As snow, that lies"
770,CANTO XXX,Amidst the living rafters on the back
771,CANTO XXX,Of Italy congeal'd when drifted high
772,CANTO XXX,"And closely pil'd by rough Sclavonian blasts,"
773,CANTO XXX,"Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,"
774,CANTO XXX,"And straightway melting it distils away,"
775,CANTO XXX,"Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,"
776,CANTO XXX,"Without a sigh or tear, or ever these"
777,CANTO XXX,"Did sing, that with the chiming of heav'n's sphere,"
778,CANTO XXX,Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain
779,CANTO XXX,"Of dulcet symphony, express'd for me"
780,CANTO XXX,"Their soft compassion, more than could the words"
781,CANTO XXX,"""Virgin, why so consum'st him?""  then the ice,"
782,CANTO XXX,"Congeal'd about my bosom, turn'd itself"
783,CANTO XXX,"To spirit and water, and with anguish forth"
784,CANTO XXX,Gush'd through the lips and eyelids from the heart.
785,CANTO XXX,
786,CANTO XXX,"Upon the chariot's right edge still she stood,"
787,CANTO XXX,"Immovable, and thus address'd her words"
788,CANTO XXX,To those bright semblances with pity touch'd:
789,CANTO XXX,"""Ye in th' eternal day your vigils keep,"
790,CANTO XXX,"So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,"
791,CANTO XXX,Conveys from you a single step in all
792,CANTO XXX,The goings on of life: thence with more heed
793,CANTO XXX,"I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,"
794,CANTO XXX,"Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now"
795,CANTO XXX,May equal the transgression.  Not alone
796,CANTO XXX,"Through operation of the mighty orbs,"
797,CANTO XXX,"That mark each seed to some predestin'd aim,"
798,CANTO XXX,As with aspect or fortunate or ill
799,CANTO XXX,"The constellations meet, but through benign"
800,CANTO XXX,"Largess of heav'nly graces, which rain down"
801,CANTO XXX,"From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man"
802,CANTO XXX,"Was in the freshness of his being, such,"
803,CANTO XXX,"So gifted virtually, that in him"
804,CANTO XXX,All better habits wond'rously had thriv'd.
805,CANTO XXX,"The more of kindly strength is in the soil,"
806,CANTO XXX,So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
807,CANTO XXX,"Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness."
808,CANTO XXX,These looks sometime upheld him; for I show'd
809,CANTO XXX,"My youthful eyes, and led him by their light"
810,CANTO XXX,In upright walking.  Soon as I had reach'd
811,CANTO XXX,"The threshold of my second age, and chang'd"
812,CANTO XXX,"My mortal for immortal, then he left me,"
813,CANTO XXX,And gave himself to others.  When from flesh
814,CANTO XXX,"To spirit I had risen, and increase"
815,CANTO XXX,"Of beauty and of virtue circled me,"
816,CANTO XXX,"I was less dear to him, and valued less."
817,CANTO XXX,"His steps were turn'd into deceitful ways,"
818,CANTO XXX,"Following false images of good, that make"
819,CANTO XXX,No promise perfect.  Nor avail'd me aught
820,CANTO XXX,"To sue for inspirations, with the which,"
821,CANTO XXX,"I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,"
822,CANTO XXX,"Did call him back; of them so little reck'd him,"
823,CANTO XXX,"Such depth he fell, that all device was short"
824,CANTO XXX,"Of his preserving, save that he should view"
825,CANTO XXX,The children of perdition.  To this end
826,CANTO XXX,I visited the purlieus of the dead:
827,CANTO XXX,"And one, who hath conducted him thus high,"
828,CANTO XXX,Receiv'd my supplications urg'd with weeping.
829,CANTO XXX,"It were a breaking of God's high decree,"
830,CANTO XXX,"If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted"
831,CANTO XXX,"Without the cost of some repentant tear."""

836,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
837,CANTO XXXI,
838,CANTO XXXI,"""O Thou!""  her words she thus without delay"
839,CANTO XXXI,"Resuming, turn'd their point on me, to whom"
840,CANTO XXXI,"They but with lateral edge seem'd harsh before,"
841,CANTO XXXI,"""Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream,"
842,CANTO XXXI,If this be true.  A charge so grievous needs
843,CANTO XXXI,"Thine own avowal.""  On my faculty"
844,CANTO XXXI,"Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir'd"
845,CANTO XXXI,"Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth."
846,CANTO XXXI,
847,CANTO XXXI,"A little space refraining, then she spake:"
848,CANTO XXXI,"""What dost thou muse on?  Answer me.  The wave"
849,CANTO XXXI,On thy remembrances of evil yet
850,CANTO XXXI,"Hath done no injury.""  A mingled sense"
851,CANTO XXXI,"Of fear and of confusion, from my lips"
852,CANTO XXXI,"Did such a ""Yea"" produce, as needed help"
853,CANTO XXXI,Of vision to interpret.  As when breaks
854,CANTO XXXI,"In act to be discharg'd, a cross-bow bent"
855,CANTO XXXI,"Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd,"
856,CANTO XXXI,The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;
857,CANTO XXXI,"Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst"
858,CANTO XXXI,"Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice"
859,CANTO XXXI,Was slacken'd on its way.  She straight began:
860,CANTO XXXI,"""When my desire invited thee to love"
861,CANTO XXXI,"The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,"
862,CANTO XXXI,What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain
863,CANTO XXXI,"Did meet thee, that thou so should'st quit the hope"
864,CANTO XXXI,"Of further progress, or what bait of ease"
865,CANTO XXXI,Or promise of allurement led thee on
866,CANTO XXXI,"Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should'st rather wait?"""
867,CANTO XXXI,
868,CANTO XXXI,"A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice"
869,CANTO XXXI,"To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips"
870,CANTO XXXI,"Gave utterance, wailing: ""Thy fair looks withdrawn,"
871,CANTO XXXI,"Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn'd"
872,CANTO XXXI,"My steps aside.""  She answering spake: ""Hadst thou"
873,CANTO XXXI,"Been silent, or denied what thou avow'st,"
874,CANTO XXXI,Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye
875,CANTO XXXI,Observes it.  But whene'er the sinner's cheek
876,CANTO XXXI,Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears
877,CANTO XXXI,"Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel"
878,CANTO XXXI,Of justice doth run counter to the edge.
879,CANTO XXXI,Howe'er that thou may'st profit by thy shame
880,CANTO XXXI,"For errors past, and that henceforth more strength"
881,CANTO XXXI,"May arm thee, when thou hear'st the Siren-voice,"
882,CANTO XXXI,"Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,"
883,CANTO XXXI,"And lend attentive ear, while I unfold"
884,CANTO XXXI,How opposite a way my buried flesh
885,CANTO XXXI,Should have impell'd thee.  Never didst thou spy
886,CANTO XXXI,"In art or nature aught so passing sweet,"
887,CANTO XXXI,"As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame"
888,CANTO XXXI,"Enclos'd me, and are scatter'd now in dust."
889,CANTO XXXI,"If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,"
890,CANTO XXXI,"What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish"
891,CANTO XXXI,Have tempted?  When thou first hadst felt the dart
892,CANTO XXXI,"Of perishable things, in my departing"
893,CANTO XXXI,"For better realms, thy wing thou should'st have prun'd"
894,CANTO XXXI,"To follow me, and never stoop'd again"
895,CANTO XXXI,"To 'bide a second blow for a slight girl,"
896,CANTO XXXI,Or other gaud as transient and as vain.
897,CANTO XXXI,"The new and inexperienc'd bird awaits,"
898,CANTO XXXI,"Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler's aim;"
899,CANTO XXXI,"But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,"
900,CANTO XXXI,"In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing'd."""
901,CANTO XXXI,
902,CANTO XXXI,"I stood, as children silent and asham'd"
903,CANTO XXXI,"Stand, list'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,"
904,CANTO XXXI,Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn'd.
905,CANTO XXXI,"And she resum'd: ""If, but to hear thus pains thee,"
906,CANTO XXXI,"Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!"""
907,CANTO XXXI,
908,CANTO XXXI,"With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,"
909,CANTO XXXI,"Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows"
910,CANTO XXXI,"From off the pole, or from Iarbas' land,"
911,CANTO XXXI,Than I at her behest my visage rais'd:
912,CANTO XXXI,"And thus the face denoting by the beard,"
913,CANTO XXXI,I mark'd the secret sting her words convey'd.
914,CANTO XXXI,
915,CANTO XXXI,"No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,"
916,CANTO XXXI,Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
917,CANTO XXXI,Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes
918,CANTO XXXI,"Yet unassur'd and wavering, bent their light"
919,CANTO XXXI,"On Beatrice.  Towards the animal,"
920,CANTO XXXI,"Who joins two natures in one form, she turn'd,"
921,CANTO XXXI,"And, even under shadow of her veil,"
922,CANTO XXXI,"And parted by the verdant rill, that flow'd"
923,CANTO XXXI,"Between, in loveliness appear'd as much"
924,CANTO XXXI,"Her former self surpassing, as on earth"
925,CANTO XXXI,All others she surpass'd.  Remorseful goads
926,CANTO XXXI,"Shot sudden through me.  Each thing else, the more"
927,CANTO XXXI,"Its love had late beguil'd me, now the more"
928,CANTO XXXI,I Was loathsome.  On my heart so keenly smote
929,CANTO XXXI,"The bitter consciousness, that on the ground"
930,CANTO XXXI,"O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,"
931,CANTO XXXI,She knows who was the cause.  When now my strength
932,CANTO XXXI,"Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart,"
933,CANTO XXXI,"The lady, whom alone I first had seen,"
934,CANTO XXXI,"I found above me.  ""Loose me not,"" she cried:"
935,CANTO XXXI,"""Loose not thy hold;"" and lo! had dragg'd me high"
936,CANTO XXXI,"As to my neck into the stream, while she,"
937,CANTO XXXI,"Still as she drew me after, swept along,"
938,CANTO XXXI,"Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave."
939,CANTO XXXI,
940,CANTO XXXI,The blessed shore approaching then was heard
941,CANTO XXXI,"So sweetly, ""Tu asperges me,"" that I"
942,CANTO XXXI,"May not remember, much less tell the sound."
943,CANTO XXXI,"The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd"
944,CANTO XXXI,"My temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit"
945,CANTO XXXI,"The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,"
946,CANTO XXXI,Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
947,CANTO XXXI,"Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm"
948,CANTO XXXI,"They each did cover me.  ""Here are we nymphs,"
949,CANTO XXXI,And in the heav'n are stars.  Or ever earth
950,CANTO XXXI,"Was visited of Beatrice, we"
951,CANTO XXXI,"Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her."
952,CANTO XXXI,We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light
953,CANTO XXXI,"Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,"
954,CANTO XXXI,"Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,"
955,CANTO XXXI,"Thy sight shall quicken.""  Thus began their song;"
956,CANTO XXXI,"And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,"
957,CANTO XXXI,"While, turn'd toward us, Beatrice stood."
958,CANTO XXXI,"""Spare not thy vision.  We have stationed thee"
959,CANTO XXXI,"Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile"
960,CANTO XXXI,"Hath drawn his weapons on thee.""  As they spake,"
961,CANTO XXXI,A thousand fervent wishes riveted
962,CANTO XXXI,"Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood"
963,CANTO XXXI,Still fix'd toward the Gryphon motionless.
964,CANTO XXXI,"As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus"
965,CANTO XXXI,"Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,"
966,CANTO XXXI,"For ever varying, in one figure now"
967,CANTO XXXI,"Reflected, now in other.  Reader! muse"
968,CANTO XXXI,How wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark
969,CANTO XXXI,"A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,"
970,CANTO XXXI,Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.
971,CANTO XXXI,
972,CANTO XXXI,"Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul"
973,CANTO XXXI,"Fed on the viand, whereof still desire"
974,CANTO XXXI,"Grows with satiety, the other three"
975,CANTO XXXI,"With gesture, that declar'd a loftier line,"
976,CANTO XXXI,Advanc'd: to their own carol on they came
977,CANTO XXXI,Dancing in festive ring angelical.
978,CANTO XXXI,
979,CANTO XXXI,"""Turn, Beatrice!"" was their song: ""O turn"
980,CANTO XXXI,"Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,"
981,CANTO XXXI,Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
982,CANTO XXXI,Hath measur'd.  Gracious at our pray'r vouchsafe
983,CANTO XXXI,Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark
984,CANTO XXXI,"Thy second beauty, now conceal'd.""  O splendour!"
985,CANTO XXXI,O sacred light eternal! who is he
986,CANTO XXXI,"So pale with musing in Pierian shades,"
987,CANTO XXXI,"Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,"
988,CANTO XXXI,Whose spirit should not fail him in th' essay
989,CANTO XXXI,"To represent thee such as thou didst seem,"
990,CANTO XXXI,When under cope of the still-chiming heaven
991,CANTO XXXI,Thou gav'st to open air thy charms reveal'd.
992,CANTO XXXI,
993,CANTO XXXI,
994,CANTO XXXI,
995,CANTO XXXI,
996,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
997,CANTO XXXII,
998,CANTO XXXII,"Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,"
999,CANTO XXXII,"Were bent to rid them of their ten years' thirst,"
1000,CANTO XXXII,No other sense was waking: and e'en they
1001,CANTO XXXII,Were fenc'd on either side from heed of aught;
1002,CANTO XXXII,So tangled in its custom'd toils that smile
1003,CANTO XXXII,"Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,"
1004,CANTO XXXII,When forcibly toward the left my sight
1005,CANTO XXXII,The sacred virgins turn'd; for from their lips
1006,CANTO XXXII,"I heard the warning sounds: ""Too fix'd a gaze!"""
1007,CANTO XXXII,
1008,CANTO XXXII,Awhile my vision labor'd; as when late
1009,CANTO XXXII,Upon the' o'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:
1010,CANTO XXXII,"But soon to lesser object, as the view"
1011,CANTO XXXII,Was now recover'd (lesser in respect
1012,CANTO XXXII,"To that excess of sensible, whence late"
1013,CANTO XXXII,I had perforce been sunder'd) on their right
1014,CANTO XXXII,"I mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn,"
1015,CANTO XXXII,"Against the sun and sev'nfold lights, their front."
1016,CANTO XXXII,"As when, their bucklers for protection rais'd,"
1017,CANTO XXXII,"A well-rang'd troop, with portly banners curl'd,"
1018,CANTO XXXII,"Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:"
1019,CANTO XXXII,E'en thus the goodly regiment of heav'n
1020,CANTO XXXII,"Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car"
1021,CANTO XXXII,Had slop'd his beam.  Attendant at the wheels
1022,CANTO XXXII,The damsels turn'd; and on the Gryphon mov'd
1023,CANTO XXXII,"The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,"
1024,CANTO XXXII,No feather on him trembled.  The fair dame
1025,CANTO XXXII,"Who through the wave had drawn me, companied"
1026,CANTO XXXII,"By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,"
1027,CANTO XXXII,"Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch."
1028,CANTO XXXII,
1029,CANTO XXXII,"Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,"
1030,CANTO XXXII,Who by the serpent was beguil'd) I past
1031,CANTO XXXII,With step in cadence to the harmony
1032,CANTO XXXII,"Angelic.  Onward had we mov'd, as far"
1033,CANTO XXXII,Perchance as arrow at three several flights
1034,CANTO XXXII,"Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down"
1035,CANTO XXXII,Descended Beatrice.  With one voice
1036,CANTO XXXII,"All murmur'd  ""Adam,"" circling next a plant"
1037,CANTO XXXII,Despoil'd of flowers and leaf on every bough.
1038,CANTO XXXII,"Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,"
1039,CANTO XXXII,"Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds for height"
1040,CANTO XXXII,"The Indians might have gaz'd at.  ""Blessed thou!"
1041,CANTO XXXII,"Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree"
1042,CANTO XXXII,Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite
1043,CANTO XXXII,"Was warp'd to evil.""  Round the stately trunk"
1044,CANTO XXXII,"Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return'd"
1045,CANTO XXXII,"The animal twice-gender'd: ""Yea: for so"
1046,CANTO XXXII,"The generation of the just are sav'd."""
1047,CANTO XXXII,"And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot"
1048,CANTO XXXII,"He drew it of the widow'd branch, and bound"
1049,CANTO XXXII,There left unto the stock whereon it grew.
1050,CANTO XXXII,
1051,CANTO XXXII,As when large floods of radiance from above
1052,CANTO XXXII,"Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends"
1053,CANTO XXXII,"Next after setting of the scaly sign,"
1054,CANTO XXXII,"Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew"
1055,CANTO XXXII,"His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok'd"
1056,CANTO XXXII,Beneath another star his flamy steeds;
1057,CANTO XXXII,"Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,"
1058,CANTO XXXII,"And deeper than the violet, was renew'd"
1059,CANTO XXXII,"The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare."
1060,CANTO XXXII,
1061,CANTO XXXII,"Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose."
1062,CANTO XXXII,"I understood it not, nor to the end"
1063,CANTO XXXII,Endur'd the harmony.  Had I the skill
1064,CANTO XXXII,"To pencil forth, how clos'd th' unpitying eyes"
1065,CANTO XXXII,"Slumb'ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid"
1066,CANTO XXXII,"So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,"
1067,CANTO XXXII,"That with a model paints, I might design"
1068,CANTO XXXII,The manner of my falling into sleep.
1069,CANTO XXXII,But feign who will the slumber cunningly;
1070,CANTO XXXII,"I pass it by to when I wak'd, and tell"
1071,CANTO XXXII,How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
1072,CANTO XXXII,"The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:"
1073,CANTO XXXII,"""Arise, what dost thou?""  As the chosen three,"
1074,CANTO XXXII,"On Tabor's mount, admitted to behold"
1075,CANTO XXXII,"The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit"
1076,CANTO XXXII,"Is coveted of angels, and doth make"
1077,CANTO XXXII,"Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves"
1078,CANTO XXXII,"Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps"
1079,CANTO XXXII,"Were broken, that they their tribe diminish'd saw,"
1080,CANTO XXXII,"Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang'd"
1081,CANTO XXXII,The stole their master wore: thus to myself
1082,CANTO XXXII,"Returning, over me beheld I stand"
1083,CANTO XXXII,"The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought"
1084,CANTO XXXII,"My steps.  ""And where,"" all doubting, I exclaim'd,"
1085,CANTO XXXII,"""Is Beatrice?""--""See her,"" she replied,"
1086,CANTO XXXII,"""Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root."
1087,CANTO XXXII,Behold th' associate choir that circles her.
1088,CANTO XXXII,"The others, with a melody more sweet"
1089,CANTO XXXII,"And more profound, journeying to higher realms,"
1090,CANTO XXXII,"Upon the Gryphon tend.""  If there her words"
1091,CANTO XXXII,"Were clos'd, I know not; but mine eyes had now"
1092,CANTO XXXII,"Ta'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts"
1093,CANTO XXXII,Were barr'd admittance.  On the very ground
1094,CANTO XXXII,"Alone she sat, as she had there been left"
1095,CANTO XXXII,"A guard upon the wain, which I beheld"
1096,CANTO XXXII,Bound to the twyform beast.  The seven nymphs
1097,CANTO XXXII,"Did make themselves a cloister round about her,"
1098,CANTO XXXII,And in their hands upheld those lights secure
1099,CANTO XXXII,From blast septentrion and the gusty south.
1100,CANTO XXXII,
1101,CANTO XXXII,"""A little while thou shalt be forester here:"
1102,CANTO XXXII,"And citizen shalt be forever with me,"
1103,CANTO XXXII,"Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman"
1104,CANTO XXXII,"To profit the misguided world, keep now"
1105,CANTO XXXII,"Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,"
1106,CANTO XXXII,"Take heed thou write, returning to that place."""
1107,CANTO XXXII,
1108,CANTO XXXII,Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin'd
1109,CANTO XXXII,"Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,"
1110,CANTO XXXII,"I, as she bade, directed.  Never fire,"
1111,CANTO XXXII,"With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud"
1112,CANTO XXXII,"Leap'd downward from the welkin's farthest bound,"
1113,CANTO XXXII,As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
1114,CANTO XXXII,"Pounce on the tree, and, as he rush'd, the rind,"
1115,CANTO XXXII,"Disparting crush beneath him, buds much more"
1116,CANTO XXXII,And leaflets.  On the car with all his might
1117,CANTO XXXII,"He struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel'd,"
1118,CANTO XXXII,"At random driv'n, to starboard now, o'ercome,"
1119,CANTO XXXII,"And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves."
1120,CANTO XXXII,
1121,CANTO XXXII,Next springing up into the chariot's womb
1122,CANTO XXXII,"A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin'd"
1123,CANTO XXXII,"Of all good food.  But, for his ugly sins"
1124,CANTO XXXII,"The saintly maid rebuking him, away"
1125,CANTO XXXII,"Scamp'ring he turn'd, fast as his hide-bound corpse"
1126,CANTO XXXII,"Would bear him.  Next, from whence before he came,"
1127,CANTO XXXII,I saw the eagle dart into the hull
1128,CANTO XXXII,"O' th' car, and leave it with his feathers lin'd;"
1129,CANTO XXXII,"And then a voice, like that which issues forth"
1130,CANTO XXXII,"From heart with sorrow riv'd, did issue forth"
1131,CANTO XXXII,"From heav'n, and, ""O poor bark of mine!"" it cried,"
1132,CANTO XXXII,"""How badly art thou freighted!""  Then, it seem'd,"
1133,CANTO XXXII,"That the earth open'd between either wheel,"
1134,CANTO XXXII,"And I beheld a dragon issue thence,"
1135,CANTO XXXII,That through the chariot fix'd his forked train;
1136,CANTO XXXII,"And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,"
1137,CANTO XXXII,"So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg'd"
1138,CANTO XXXII,"Part of the bottom forth, and went his way"
1139,CANTO XXXII,"Exulting.  What remain'd, as lively turf"
1140,CANTO XXXII,"With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,"
1141,CANTO XXXII,Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
1142,CANTO XXXII,"Been offer'd; and therewith were cloth'd the wheels,"
1143,CANTO XXXII,"Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly"
1144,CANTO XXXII,"A sigh were not breath'd sooner.  Thus transform'd,"
1145,CANTO XXXII,"The holy structure, through its several parts,"
1146,CANTO XXXII,"Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one"
1147,CANTO XXXII,"On every side; the first like oxen horn'd,"
1148,CANTO XXXII,But with a single horn upon their front
1149,CANTO XXXII,The four.  Like monster sight hath never seen.
1150,CANTO XXXII,"O'er it methought there sat, secure as rock"
1151,CANTO XXXII,"On mountain's lofty top, a shameless whore,"
1152,CANTO XXXII,"Whose ken rov'd loosely round her.  At her side,"
1153,CANTO XXXII,"As 't were that none might bear her off, I saw"
1154,CANTO XXXII,"A giant stand; and ever, and anon"
1155,CANTO XXXII,"They mingled kisses.  But, her lustful eyes"
1156,CANTO XXXII,"Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion"
1157,CANTO XXXII,Scourg'd her from head to foot all o'er; then full
1158,CANTO XXXII,"Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos'd"
1159,CANTO XXXII,"The monster, and dragg'd on, so far across"
1160,CANTO XXXII,"The forest, that from me its shades alone"
1161,CANTO XXXII,Shielded the harlot and the new-form'd brute.
1162,CANTO XXXII,
1163,CANTO XXXII,
1164,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
1165,CANTO XXXIII,
1166,CANTO XXXIII,"""The heathen, Lord! are come!"" responsive thus,"
1167,CANTO XXXIII,"The trinal now, and now the virgin band"
1168,CANTO XXXIII,"Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,"
1169,CANTO XXXIII,"Weeping; and Beatrice listen'd, sad"
1170,CANTO XXXIII,"And sighing, to the song', in such a mood,"
1171,CANTO XXXIII,"That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,"
1172,CANTO XXXIII,Was scarce more chang'd.  But when they gave her place
1173,CANTO XXXIII,"To speak, then, risen upright on her feet,"
1174,CANTO XXXIII,"She, with a colour glowing bright as fire,"
1175,CANTO XXXIII,"Did answer: ""Yet a little while, and ye"
1176,CANTO XXXIII,"Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,"
1177,CANTO XXXIII,"Again a little while, and ye shall see me."""
1178,CANTO XXXIII,
1179,CANTO XXXIII,"Before her then she marshall'd all the seven,"
1180,CANTO XXXIII,"And, beck'ning only motion'd me, the dame,"
1181,CANTO XXXIII,"And that remaining sage, to follow her."
1182,CANTO XXXIII,
1183,CANTO XXXIII,"So on she pass'd; and had not set, I ween,"
1184,CANTO XXXIII,"Her tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes"
1185,CANTO XXXIII,"Her eyes encounter'd; and, with visage mild,"
1186,CANTO XXXIII,"""So mend thy pace,"" she cried, ""that if my words"
1187,CANTO XXXIII,"Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac'd"
1188,CANTO XXXIII,"To hear them.""  Soon as duly to her side"
1189,CANTO XXXIII,"I now had hasten'd: ""Brother!"" she began,"
1190,CANTO XXXIII,"""Why mak'st thou no attempt at questioning,"
1191,CANTO XXXIII,"As thus we walk together?""  Like to those"
1192,CANTO XXXIII,"Who, speaking with too reverent an awe"
1193,CANTO XXXIII,"Before their betters, draw not forth the voice"
1194,CANTO XXXIII,"Alive unto their lips, befell me shell"
1195,CANTO XXXIII,That I in sounds imperfect thus began:
1196,CANTO XXXIII,"""Lady! what I have need of, that thou know'st,"
1197,CANTO XXXIII,"And what will suit my need.""  She answering thus:"
1198,CANTO XXXIII,"""Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou"
1199,CANTO XXXIII,"Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,"
1200,CANTO XXXIII,As one who dreams.  Thus far be taught of me:
1201,CANTO XXXIII,"The vessel, which thou saw'st the serpent break,"
1202,CANTO XXXIII,"Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,"
1203,CANTO XXXIII,Hope not to scare God's vengeance with a sop.
1204,CANTO XXXIII,Without an heir for ever shall not be
1205,CANTO XXXIII,"That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum'd,"
1206,CANTO XXXIII,Which monster made it first and next a prey.
1207,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars"
1208,CANTO XXXIII,"E'en now approaching, whose conjunction, free"
1209,CANTO XXXIII,"From all impediment and bar, brings on"
1210,CANTO XXXIII,"A season, in the which, one sent from God,"
1211,CANTO XXXIII,"(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)"
1212,CANTO XXXIII,"That foul one, and th' accomplice of her guilt,"
1213,CANTO XXXIII,"The giant, both shall slay.  And if perchance"
1214,CANTO XXXIII,"My saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,"
1215,CANTO XXXIII,"Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils"
1216,CANTO XXXIII,The intellect with blindness) yet ere long
1217,CANTO XXXIII,"Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve"
1218,CANTO XXXIII,"This knotty riddle, and no damage light"
1219,CANTO XXXIII,On flock or field.  Take heed; and as these words
1220,CANTO XXXIII,"By me are utter'd, teach them even so"
1221,CANTO XXXIII,"To those who live that life, which is a race"
1222,CANTO XXXIII,"To death: and when thou writ'st them, keep in mind"
1223,CANTO XXXIII,"Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,"
1224,CANTO XXXIII,"That twice hath now been spoil'd.  This whoso robs,"
1225,CANTO XXXIII,"This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed"
1226,CANTO XXXIII,"Sins against God, who for his use alone"
1227,CANTO XXXIII,"Creating hallow'd it.  For taste of this,"
1228,CANTO XXXIII,"In pain and in desire, five thousand years"
1229,CANTO XXXIII,"And upward, the first soul did yearn for him,"
1230,CANTO XXXIII,Who punish'd in himself the fatal gust.
1231,CANTO XXXIII,
1232,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thy reason slumbers, if it deem this height"
1233,CANTO XXXIII,"And summit thus inverted of the plant,"
1234,CANTO XXXIII,"Without due cause: and were not vainer thoughts,"
1235,CANTO XXXIII,"As Elsa's numbing waters, to thy soul,"
1236,CANTO XXXIII,And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark
1237,CANTO XXXIII,"As Pyramus the mulberry, thou hadst seen,"
1238,CANTO XXXIII,"In such momentous circumstance alone,"
1239,CANTO XXXIII,God's equal justice morally implied
1240,CANTO XXXIII,In the forbidden tree.  But since I mark thee
1241,CANTO XXXIII,"In understanding harden'd into stone,"
1242,CANTO XXXIII,"And, to that hardness, spotted too and stain'd,"
1243,CANTO XXXIII,"So that thine eye is dazzled at my word,"
1244,CANTO XXXIII,"I will, that, if not written, yet at least"
1245,CANTO XXXIII,"Painted thou take it in thee, for the cause,"
1246,CANTO XXXIII,"That one brings home his staff inwreath'd with palm."""
1247,CANTO XXXIII,
1248,CANTO XXXIII,"I thus: ""As wax by seal, that changeth not"
1249,CANTO XXXIII,"Its impress, now is stamp'd my brain by thee."
1250,CANTO XXXIII,But wherefore soars thy wish'd-for speech so high
1251,CANTO XXXIII,"Beyond my sight, that loses it the more,"
1252,CANTO XXXIII,"The more it strains to reach it?""--""To the end"
1253,CANTO XXXIII,"That thou mayst know,"" she answer'd straight, ""the school,"
1254,CANTO XXXIII,"That thou hast follow'd; and how far behind,"
1255,CANTO XXXIII,"When following my discourse, its learning halts:"
1256,CANTO XXXIII,"And mayst behold your art, from the divine"
1257,CANTO XXXIII,"As distant, as the disagreement is"
1258,CANTO XXXIII,"'Twixt earth and heaven's most high and rapturous orb."""
1259,CANTO XXXIII,
1260,CANTO XXXIII,"""I not remember,"" I replied, ""that e'er"
1261,CANTO XXXIII,"I was estrang'd from thee, nor for such fault"
1262,CANTO XXXIII,"Doth conscience chide me.""  Smiling she return'd:"
1263,CANTO XXXIII,"""If thou canst, not remember, call to mind"
1264,CANTO XXXIII,How lately thou hast drunk of Lethe's wave;
1265,CANTO XXXIII,"And, sure as smoke doth indicate a flame,"
1266,CANTO XXXIII,In that forgetfulness itself conclude
1267,CANTO XXXIII,Blame from thy alienated will incurr'd.
1268,CANTO XXXIII,From henceforth verily my words shall be
1269,CANTO XXXIII,As naked as will suit them to appear
1270,CANTO XXXIII,"In thy unpractis'd view.""  More sparkling now,"
1271,CANTO XXXIII,And with retarded course the sun possess'd
1272,CANTO XXXIII,"The circle of mid-day, that varies still"
1273,CANTO XXXIII,"As th' aspect varies of each several clime,"
1274,CANTO XXXIII,"When, as one, sent in vaward of a troop"
1275,CANTO XXXIII,"For escort, pauses, if perchance he spy"
1276,CANTO XXXIII,Vestige of somewhat strange and rare: so paus'd
1277,CANTO XXXIII,"The sev'nfold band, arriving at the verge"
1278,CANTO XXXIII,"Of a dun umbrage hoar, such as is seen,"
1279,CANTO XXXIII,"Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches, oft"
1280,CANTO XXXIII,To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff.
1281,CANTO XXXIII,"And, where they stood, before them, as it seem'd,"
1282,CANTO XXXIII,"Tigris and Euphrates both beheld,"
1283,CANTO XXXIII,"Forth from one fountain issue; and, like friends,"
1284,CANTO XXXIII,"Linger at parting. ""O enlight'ning beam!"
1285,CANTO XXXIII,O glory of our kind! beseech thee say
1286,CANTO XXXIII,"What water this, which from one source deriv'd"
1287,CANTO XXXIII,"Itself removes to distance from itself?"""
1288,CANTO XXXIII,
1289,CANTO XXXIII,To such entreaty answer thus was made:
1290,CANTO XXXIII,"""Entreat Matilda, that she teach thee this."""
1291,CANTO XXXIII,
1292,CANTO XXXIII,"And here, as one, who clears himself of blame"
1293,CANTO XXXIII,"Imputed, the fair dame return'd: ""Of me"
1294,CANTO XXXIII,He this and more hath learnt; and I am safe
1295,CANTO XXXIII,"That Lethe's water hath not hid it from him."""
1296,CANTO XXXIII,
1297,CANTO XXXIII,"And Beatrice: ""Some more pressing care"
1298,CANTO XXXIII,"That oft the memory 'reeves, perchance hath made"
1299,CANTO XXXIII,His mind's eye dark.  But lo! where Eunoe cows!
1300,CANTO XXXIII,"Lead thither; and, as thou art wont, revive"
1301,CANTO XXXIII,"His fainting virtue.""  As a courteous spirit,"
1302,CANTO XXXIII,"That proffers no excuses, but as soon"
1303,CANTO XXXIII,"As he hath token of another's will,"
1304,CANTO XXXIII,"Makes it his own; when she had ta'en me, thus"
1305,CANTO XXXIII,"The lovely maiden mov'd her on, and call'd"
1306,CANTO XXXIII,To Statius with an air most lady-like:
1307,CANTO XXXIII,"""Come thou with him.""  Were further space allow'd,"
1308,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, Reader, might I sing, though but in part,"
1309,CANTO XXXIII,"That beverage, with whose sweetness I had ne'er"
1310,CANTO XXXIII,"Been sated.  But, since all the leaves are full,"
1311,CANTO XXXIII,"Appointed for this second strain, mine art"
1312,CANTO XXXIII,With warning bridle checks me.  I return'd
1313,CANTO XXXIII,"From the most holy wave, regenerate,"
1314,CANTO XXXIII,"If 'en as new plants renew'd with foliage new,"
1315,CANTO XXXIII,Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars.
