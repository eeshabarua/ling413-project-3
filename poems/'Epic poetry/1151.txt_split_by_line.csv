60,PREFACE,PREFACE
61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,This work has been undertaken in the belief that a literal translation
63,PREFACE,"of as famous an epic as the ""Nibelungenlied"" would be acceptable to the"
64,PREFACE,general reading public whose interest in the story of Siegfried has
65,PREFACE,been stimulated by Wagner's operas and by the reading of such poems as
66,PREFACE,"William Morris' ""Sigurd the Volsung"". Prose has been selected as the"
67,PREFACE,"medium of translation, since it is hardly possible to give an accurate"
68,PREFACE,rendering and at the same time to meet the demands imposed by rhyme
69,PREFACE,"and metre; at least, none of the verse translations made thus far have"
70,PREFACE,"succeeded in doing this. The prose translations, on the other hand,"
71,PREFACE,"mostly err in being too continuous and in condensing too much, so that"
72,PREFACE,they retell the story instead of translating it. The present translator
73,PREFACE,has tried to avoid these two extremes. He has endeavored to translate
74,PREFACE,"literally and accurately, and to reproduce the spirit of the original,"
75,PREFACE,as far as a prose translation will permit. To this end the language has
76,PREFACE,been made as simple and as Saxon in character as possible. An exception
77,PREFACE,"has been made, however, in the case of such Romance words as were in use"
78,PREFACE,"in England during the age of the romances of chivalry, and which would"
79,PREFACE,help to land a Romance coloring; these have been frequently employed.
80,PREFACE,"Very few obsolete words have been used, and these are explained in the"
81,PREFACE,"notes, but the language has been made to some extent archaic, especially"
82,PREFACE,"in dialogue, in order to give the impression of age. At the request of"
83,PREFACE,the publishers the Introduction Sketch has been shorn of the apparatus
84,PREFACE,of scholarship and made as popular as a study of the poem and its
85,PREFACE,sources would allow. The advanced student who may be interested in
86,PREFACE,consulting authorities will find them given in the introduction to the
87,PREFACE,parallel edition in the Riverside Literature Series. A short list of
88,PREFACE,"English works on the subject had, however, been added."
89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,"In conclusion the translator would like to thank his colleagues, C.G."
91,PREFACE,"Child and Cornelius Weygandt, for their helpful suggestions in starting"
92,PREFACE,"the work, and also to acknowledge his indebtedness to the German edition"
93,PREFACE,"of Paul Piper, especially in preparing the notes."

102,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH
103,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
104,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,There is probably no poem of German literature that has excited such
105,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"universal interest, or that has been so much studied and discussed, as"
106,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the ""Nibelungenlied"". In its present form it is a product of the age"
107,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of chivalry, but it reaches back to the earliest epochs of German"
108,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"antiquity, and embraces not only the pageantry of courtly chivalry,"
109,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,but also traits of ancient Germanic folklore and probably of Teutonic
110,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"mythology. One of its earliest critics fitly called it a German ""Iliad"","
111,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"for, like this great Greek epic, it goes back to the remotest times and"
112,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,unites the monumental fragments of half-forgotten myths and historical
113,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"personages into a poem that is essentially national in character, and"
114,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the embodiment of all that is great in the antiquity of the race. Though
115,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"lacking to some extent the dignity of the ""Iliad"", the ""Nibelungenlied"""
116,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"surpasses the former in the deep tragedy which pervades it, the tragedy"
117,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of fate, the inevitable retribution for crime, the never-dying struggle"
118,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"between the powers of good and evil, between light and darkness."
119,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
120,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,That the poem must have been exceedingly popular during the Middle Ages
121,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,is evinced by the great number of Manuscripts that have come down to us.
122,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"We possess in all twenty-eight more or less complete MSS., preserved"
123,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in thirty-one fragments, fifteen of which date from the thirteenth and"
124,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"fourteenth centuries. Of all these MSS., but nine are so well preserved"
125,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"that, in spite of some minor breaks, they can be considered complete. Of"
126,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"this number three, designated respectively as A, B, C, are looked upon"
127,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"as the most important for purposes of textual criticism, and around them"
128,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"a fierce battle has been waged, which is not even yet settled. (1) It"
129,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is now generally conceded that the longest MS., C, is a later redaction"
130,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"with many additional strophes, but opinions are divided as to whether"
131,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the priority should be given to A or B, the probabilities being that B"
132,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is the more original, A merely a careless copy of B."
133,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
134,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"In spite of the great popularity of the ""Nibelungenlied"", the poem was"
135,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,soon forgotten by the mass of the people. With the decay of courtly
136,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"chivalry and the rise of the prosperous citizen class, whose ideals and"
137,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"tastes lay in a different direction, this epic shared the fate of many"
138,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"others of its kind, and was relegated to the dusty shelves of monastery"
139,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"or ducal libraries, there to wait till a more cultured age, curious"
140,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"as to the literature of its ancestors, should bring it forth from"
141,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"its hiding places. However, the figures of the old legend were not"
142,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"forgotten, but lived on among the people, and were finally embodied in a"
143,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"popular ballad, ""Das Lied vom HÃ¼rnen Seyfrid"", which has been preserved"
144,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in a print of the sixteenth century, although the poem itself is thought"
145,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,to go back at least to the thirteenth. The legend was also dramatized by
146,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Hans Sachs, the shoemaker poet of Nuremberg, and related in prose form"
147,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,in a chap book which still exists in prints of the eighteenth century.
148,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The story and the characters gradually became so vague and distorted,"
149,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,that only a trained eye could detect in the burlesque figures of the
150,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,popular account the heroes of the ancient Germanic Legend.
151,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
152,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The honor of rediscovering the ""Nibelungenlied"" and of restoring it to"
153,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the world of literature belongs to a young physician by the name of J.H.
154,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Obereit, who found the manuscript C at the castle of Hohenems in the"
155,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Tirol on June 29, 1755; but the scientific study of the poem begins with"
156,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Karl Lachmann, one of the keenest philological critics that Germany"
157,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,has ever produced. In 1816 he read before the University of Berlin
158,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his epoch-making essay upon the original form of the ""Nibelungenlied""."
159,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Believing that the poem was made up of a number of distinct ballads
160,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"or lays, he sought by means of certain criteria to eliminate all parts"
161,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which were, as he thought, later interpolations or emendations. As a"
162,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"result of this sifting and discarding process, he reduced the poem"
163,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to what he considered to have been its original form, namely, twenty"
164,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"separate lays, which he thought had come down to us in practically the"
165,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,same form in which they had been sung by various minstrels.
166,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
167,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,This view is no longer held in its original form. Though we have every
168,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"reason to believe that ballads of Siegfried the dragon killer, of"
169,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried and Kriemhild, and of the destruction of the Nibelungs existed"
170,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in Germany, yet these ballads are no longer to be seen in our poem. They"
171,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,formed merely the basis or source for some poet who thought to revive
172,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the old heroic legends of the German past which were familiar to his
173,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,hearers and to adapt them to the tastes of his time. In all probability
174,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"we must assume two, three, or even more steps in the genesis of the"
175,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"poem. There appear to have been two different sources, one a Low German"
176,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"account, quite simple and brief, the other a tradition of the Lower"
177,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Rhine. The legend was perhaps developed by minstrels along the Rhine,"
178,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,until it was taken and worked up into its present form by some Austrian
179,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"poet. Who this poet was we do not know, but we do know that he was"
180,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,perfectly familiar with all the details of courtly etiquette. He seems
181,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,also to have been acquainted with the courtly epics of Heinrich von
182,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Veldeke and Hartman von Ouwe, but his poem is free from the tedious and"
183,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"often exaggerated descriptions of pomp, dress, and court ceremonies,"
184,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,that mar the beauty of even the best of the courtly epics. Many
185,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,painstaking attempts have been made to discover the identity of the
186,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"writer of our poem, but even the most plausible of all these theories"
187,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which considers Kurenberg, one of the earliest of the ""Minnesingers"","
188,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to be the author, because of the similarity of the strophic form of our"
189,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"poem to that used by him, is not capable of absolute proof, and"
190,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,recent investigations go to show that Kurenberg was indebted to
191,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the ""Nibelungen"" strophe for the form of his lyric, and not the"
192,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungenlied"" to him. The ""Nibelungen"" strophe is presumably much"
193,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"older, and, having become popular in Austria through the poem, was"
194,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"adopted by Kurenberg for his purposes. As to the date of the poem, in"
195,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"its present form it cannot go back further than about 1190, because of"
196,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the exactness of the rhymes, nor could it have been written later"
197,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"than 1204, because of certain allusions to it in the sixth book of"
198,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Parzival"", which we know to have been written at this date. The two"
199,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Low German poems which probably form the basis of our epic may have been
200,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,united about 1150. It was revised and translated into High German and
201,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"circulated at South German courts about 1170, and then received its"
202,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"present courtly form about 1190, this last version being the immediate"
203,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,source of our manuscripts.
204,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
205,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The story of Siegfried, his tragic death, and the dire vengeance visited"
206,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"upon his slayers, which lies at the basis of our poem, antedates the"
207,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"latter by many centuries, and was known to all nations whose languages"
208,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,prove by their resemblance to the German tongue their original identity
209,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,with the German people. Not only along the banks of the Rhine and the
210,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Danube and upon the upland plains of Southern Germany, but also along"
211,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the rocky fjords of Norway, among the Angles and Saxons in their new"
212,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"home across the channel, even in the distant Shetland Islands and on the"
213,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"snow-covered wastes of Iceland, this story was told around the fires at"
214,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"night and sung to the harp in the banqueting halls of kings and nobles,"
215,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,each people and each generation telling it in its own fashion and adding
216,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,new elements of its own invention. This great geographical distribution
217,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the legend, and the variety of forms in which it appears, make it"
218,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,difficult to know where we must seek its origin. The northern version is
219,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in many respects older and simpler in form than the German, but still it"
220,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is probable that Norway was not the home of the saga, but that it took"
221,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,its rise in Germany along the banks of the Rhine among the ancient
222,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"tribe of the Franks, as is shown by the many geographical names that are"
223,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"reminiscent of the characters of the story, such as a Siegfried ""spring"""
224,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in the Odenwald, a Hagen ""well"" at Lorsch, a Brunhild ""bed"" near"
225,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Frankfort, and the well-known ""Drachenfels"", or Dragon's Rock, on the"
226,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Rhine. It is to Norway, however, that we must go for our knowledge"
227,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the story, for, singularly enough, with the exception of the"
228,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungenlied"" and the popular ballad, German literature has preserved"
229,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"almost no trace of the legend, and such as exist are too late and too"
230,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,corrupt to be of much use in determining the original features of the
231,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,story.
232,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
233,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Just when the legend emigrated to Skandinavia we do not know, but"
234,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"certainly at an early date, perhaps during the opening years of the"
235,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"sixth century. It may have been introduced by German traders, by slaves"
236,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"captured by the Northmen on their frequent marauding expeditions, or,"
237,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"as Mogk believes, may have been taken by the Heruli on their return"
238,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to Norway after their defeat by the Langobardi. By whatever channel,"
239,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"however, the story reached the North, it became part and parcel of"
240,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Skandinavian folklore, only certain names still pointing to the original"
241,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"home of the legend. In the ninth century, when Harald Harfagr changed"
242,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the ancient free constitution of the land, many Norwegians emigrated"
243,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to Iceland, taking with them these acquired legends, which were better"
244,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,preserved in this remote island because of the peaceful introduction
245,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of Christianity, than on the Continent, where the Church was more"
246,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,antagonistic to the customs and legends of the heathen period.
247,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
248,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,The Skandinavian version of the Siegfried legend has been handed down
249,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,to us in five different forms. The first of these is the poetic or
250,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"older ""Edda"", also called Saemund's ""Edda"", as it was assigned to the"
251,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"celebrated Icelandic scholar Saemundr Sigfusson. The ""Codex Regius"", in"
252,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which it is preserved, dates from the middle of the thirteenth century,"
253,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,but is probably a copy of an older manuscript. The songs it contains
254,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"were written at various times, the oldest probably in the first half of"
255,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the ninth century, the latest not much before the date of the earliest"
256,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"manuscript. Most of them, however, belong to the Viking period, when"
257,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Christianity was already beginning to influence the Norwegians, that"
258,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is, between the years 800 and 1000. They are partly heroic, partly"
259,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"mythological in character, and are written in alliterative strophes"
260,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"interspersed with prose, and have the form of dialogues. Though the"
261,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"legends on which these songs are based were brought from Norway, most of"
262,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"them were probably composed in Iceland. Among these songs, now, we find"
263,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,a number which deal with the adventures of Siegfried and his tragic end.
264,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
265,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,The second source of the Siegfried story is the so-called
266,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Volsungasaga"", a prose paraphrase of the ""Edda"" songs. The MS. dates"
267,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"from the beginning of the thirteenth century, but the account was"
268,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,probably written a century earlier. The adventures of Siegfried and his
269,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,ancestors are here related in great detail and his ancestry traced back
270,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to Wodan. Although a secondary source, as it is based on the ""Edda"", the"
271,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Volsungasaga"" is nevertheless of great importance, since it supplies a"
272,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"portion of the ""Codex Regius"" which has been lost, and thus furnishes us"
273,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,with the contents of the missing songs.
274,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
275,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The third source is the prose ""Edda"", sometimes called the ""Snorra"
276,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Edda"", after the famous Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241), to whom"
277,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"it was ascribed. The author was acquainted with both the poetic ""Edda"""
278,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and the ""Volsungasaga"", and follows these accounts closely. The younger"
279,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Edda"" is not really a tale, but a book of poetics; it relates, however,"
280,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the Siegfried saga briefly. It is considered an original source, since"
281,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"it evidently made use of songs that have not come down to us, especially"
282,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in the account of the origin of the treasure, which is here told more"
283,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in detail and with considerable differences. The ""Nornagestsaga"" or"
284,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nornageststhattr"", the story of ""Nornagest"", forms the fourth source of"
285,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the Siegfried story. It is really a part of the Olaf saga, but contains"
286,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the story of Sigurd and Gunnar (the Norse forms of Siegfried and
287,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gunther), which an old man Nornagest relates to King Olaf Tryggvason,"
288,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,who converted the Norwegians to Christianity. The story was written
289,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,about 1250 to illustrate the transition from heathendom to the Christian
290,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"faith. It is based on the ""Edda"" and the ""Volsungasaga"", and is"
291,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,therefore of minor importance as a source.
292,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
293,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,These four sources represent the early introduction of the Siegfried
294,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,legend into Skandinavia. A second introduction took place about the
295,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"middle of the thirteenth century, at the time of the flourishing of"
296,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the Hanseatic League, when the story was introduced together with other"
297,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"popular German epics. These poems are products of the age of chivalry,"
298,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and are characterized by the romantic and courtly features of this
299,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"movement. The one which concerns us here, as the fifth source of the"
300,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried story, is the so-called ""Thidreksaga"", which celebrates"
301,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the adventures of the famous legendary hero, Dietrich of Berne,"
302,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the historical Theodorich of Ravenna. In as far as it contains the
303,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"adventures of the Nibelungs, it is also called the ""Niflungasaga"". The"
304,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Thidreksaga"" was written about 1250 by a Norwegian who, as he himself"
305,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"tells us, heard the story from Germans in the neighborhood of Bremen"
306,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and Munster. Since it is thus based on Saxon traditions, it can be"
307,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"considered an independent source of the legend, and, in fact, differs"
308,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,from the earlier Norse versions in many important details. The author
309,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"was acquainted, however, with the older versions, and sought to"
310,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"compromise between them, but mostly followed his German authorities."
311,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
312,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The story, as given in the older Norse versions, is in most respects"
313,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"more original than in the ""Nibelungenlied"". It relates the history of"
314,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the treasure of the Nibelungs, tracing it back to a giant by the name of"
315,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Hreithmar"", who received it from the god ""Loki"" as a compensation for"
316,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the killing of the former's son ""Otur"", whom Loki had slain in the form"
317,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of an otter. Loki obtained the ransom from a dwarf named ""Andwari"","
318,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,who in turn had stolen it from the river gods of the Rhine. Andwari
319,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"pronounces a terrible curse upon the treasure and its possessors, and"
320,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"this curse passes from Loki to the Giant Hreithmar, who is murdered when"
321,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"asleep by his two sons ""Fafnir"" and ""Regin"". The latter, however, is"
322,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"cheated out of the coveted prize by Fafnir, who carries it away to the"
323,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Gnita"" heath, where he guards it in the form of a dragon."
324,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
325,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"This treasure, with its accompanying curse, next passes into the hands"
326,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of a human being named Sigurd (the Norse form of Siegfried, as we have"
327,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"seen), a descendant of the race of the Volsungs, who trace their history"
328,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,back to Wodan and are especially favored by him. The full story of
329,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried's ancestry is far too long to relate here, and does not"
330,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"especially concern us, as it has little or no influence on the later"
331,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,development of the story. It is sufficient for our purpose to know that
332,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried was the son of Siegmund, who was slain in battle before the"
333,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"birth of his son. Sigurd was carefully reared by his mother ""Hjordis"""
334,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and the wise dwarf Regin, who taught him the knowledge of runes and"
335,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of many languages. (2) At the suggestion of Regin, Sigurd asks for and"
336,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"receives the steed ""Grani"" from the king, and is then urged by his tutor"
337,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,to help him obtain the treasure guarded by the latter's brother Fafnir.
338,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Sigurd promises, but first demands a sword. Two, that are given him by"
339,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Regin, prove worthless, and he forges a new one from the pieces of his"
340,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"father's sword, which his mother had preserved. With this he easily"
341,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"splits the anvil and cuts in two a flake of wool, floating down the"
342,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Rhine. He first avenges the death of his father, and then sets off with"
343,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Regin to attack the dragon Fafnir. At the advice of the former Sigurd
344,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,digs a ditch across the dragon's peth and pierces him from below with
345,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his sword, as the latter comes down to drink. In dying the dragon warns"
346,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Sigurd against the treasure and its curse, and against Regin, who, he"
347,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"says, is planning Sigurd's death, intending to obtain the treasure for"
348,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,himself.
349,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
350,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"When Regin sees the dragon safely dead, he creeps from his place of"
351,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"concealment, drinks of the blood, and, cutting out the heart, begs"
352,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Sigurd to roast it for him. While doing so, Sigurd burns his fingers,"
353,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and, putting them in his mouth, understands at once the language of the"
354,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,birds and hears them say that Sigurd himself should eat the heart and
355,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,then he would be wiser than all other men. They also betray Regin's evil
356,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"designs, and counsel the lad to kill his tutor. This Sigurd then does,"
357,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"cutting off Regin's head, drinking the blood of both brothers, and"
358,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,eating Fafnir's heart. (3) On the further advice of the birds Sigurd
359,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"first fetches the treasure from the cave, and then journeys to the"
360,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"mountain ""Hindarfjall"", where he rescues the sleeping Valkyrie,"
361,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Sigrdrifa"" (""Brynhild"", ""Brunhild""), who, stung by the sleep thorn"
362,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of Wodan, and clad in full armor, lies asleep within a castle that is"
363,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"surrounded by a wall of flame. With the help of his steed Grani, Sigurd"
364,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,succeeds in penetrating through the fire to the castle. The sleeping
365,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"maiden awakes when he cuts the armor from her with his sword, for it"
366,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,was as tight as if grown fast to the flesh. She hails her deliverer
367,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"with great joy, for she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear. At"
368,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Sigurd's request she teaches him many wise precepts, and finally pledges"
369,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"her troth to him. He then departs, after promising to be faithful to her"
370,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and to remember her teachings.
371,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
372,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"On his journeyings Sigurd soon arrives at the court of ""Giuki"" (the"
373,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Norse form of the German ""Gibicho"", ""Gibich""), a king whose court lay on"
374,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the lower Rhine. Giuki has three sons, ""Gunnar"", ""Hogni"", and ""Gutthorm"","
375,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and a daughter ""Gudrun"", endowed with great beauty. The queen bears"
376,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the name of Grimhild, and is versed in magic, but possessed of an evil"
377,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"heart. (4) Sigurd is received with great honor, for his coming had been"
378,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"announced to Gudrun in dreams, which had in part been interpreted to her"
379,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"by Brynhild. The mother, knowing of Sigurd's relations to the latter,"
380,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"gives him a potion which produces forgetfulness, so that he no longer"
381,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"remembers his betrothed, and accepts the hand of Gudrun, which the king"
382,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,offers him at the queen's request. The marriage is celebrated with
383,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"great pomp, and Sigurd remains permanently attached to Giuki's court,"
384,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,performing with the others many deeds of valor.
385,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
386,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Meanwhile Grimhild urges her son Gunnar to sue for the hand of Brynhild.
387,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Taking with him Sigurd and a few others, Gunnar visits first Brynhild's"
388,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"father ""Budli"", and then her brother-in-law ""Heimir"", from both of whom"
389,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"he learns that she is free to choose whom she will, but that she will"
390,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,marry no one who has not ridden through the wall of flame. With this
391,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"answer they proceed to Brynhild's castle, where Gunnar is unable to"
392,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"pierce the flames, even when seated on Sigurd's steed. Finally Sigurd"
393,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and Gunnar change forms, and Sigurd, disguised as Gunnar, rides through"
394,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the wall of fire, announces himself to Brynhild as Gunnar, the son of"
395,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Giuki, and reminds her of her promise to marry the one who penetrated"
396,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the fire. Brynhild consents with great reluctance, for she is busy"
397,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,carrying on a war with a neighboring king. Sigurd then passes three
398,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"nights at her side, placing, however, his sword Gram between them, as"
399,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"a bar of separation. At parting he draws from her finger the ring, with"
400,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which he had originally pledged his troth to her, and replaces it with"
401,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"another, taken from Fafnir's hoard. Soon after this the marriage of"
402,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gunnar and Brynhild is celebrated with great splendor, and all return to"
403,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Giuki's court, where they live happily for some time."
404,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
405,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"One day, however, when the ladies go down to the river to take a bath,"
406,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brynhild will not bathe further down stream than Gudrun, that is, in the"
407,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"water which flows from Gudrun to her, (5) giving as the reason, that her"
408,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"father was mightier and her husband braver, since he had ridden through"
409,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the fire, while Sigurd had been a menial. Stung at this, Gudrun retorts"
410,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,that not Gunnar but Sigurd had penetrated the flames and had taken from
411,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"her the fateful ring ""Andvaranaut"", which she then shows to her rival in"
412,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"proof of her assertion. Brynhild turns deathly pale, but answers not"
413,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,a word. After a second conversation on the subject had increased the
414,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"hatred of the queens, Brynhild plans vengeance. Pretending to be ill,"
415,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"she takes to her bed, and when Gunnar inquires what ails her, she asks"
416,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,him if he remembers the circumstances of the wooing and that not he but
417,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Sigurd had penetrated the flames. She attempts to take Gunnar's life, as"
418,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"she had pledged her troth to Sigurd, and is thereupon placed in chains"
419,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"by Hogni. Seven days she sleeps, and no one dares to wake her. Finally"
420,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Sigurd succeeds in making her talk, and she tells him how cruelly she"
421,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"has been deceived, that the better man had been destined for her, but"
422,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"that she had received the poorer one. This Sigurd denies, for Giuki's"
423,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"son had killed the king of the Danes and also Budli's brother, a great"
424,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"warrior. Moreover, although he, Sigurd, had ridden through the flames,"
425,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,he had not become her husband. He begs her therefore not to harbor a
426,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,grudge against Gunnar.
427,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
428,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brynhild remains unconvinced, and plans Sigurd's death, and threatens"
429,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gunnar with the loss of dominion and life, if he will not kill Sigurd."
430,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"After some hesitation, Gunnar consents, and, calling Hogni, informs"
431,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"him that he must kill Sigurd, in order to obtain the treasure of the"
432,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Rhinegold. Hogni warns him against breaking his oath to Sigurd, when it"
433,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"occurs to Gunnar, that his brother Gutthorm had sworn no oath and might"
434,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"do the deed. Both now proceed to excite the latter's greed, and give him"
435,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,wolf's and snake meat to eat to make him savage. Twice Gutthorm makes
436,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the attempt, as Sigurd lies in bed, but is deterred by the latter's"
437,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"penetrating glance. The third time he finds Sigurd asleep, and pierces"
438,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"him with his sword. Sigurd, awakening at the pain, hurls his own sword"
439,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"after his murderer, fairly cutting him in two. He then dies, protesting"
440,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,his innocence and designating Brynhild as the instigator of his murder.
441,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brynhild at first laughs aloud at Gudrun's frantic grief, but later her"
442,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"joy turns into sorrow, and she determines to share Sigurd's death. In"
443,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"vain they try to dissuade her; donning her gold corselet, she pierces"
444,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,herself with a sword and begs to be burned on Sigurd's funeral pyre. In
445,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"dying she prophesies the future, telling of Gudrun's marriage to ""Atli"""
446,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and of the death of the many men which will be caused thereby.
447,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
448,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,After Brynhild's death Gudrun in her sorrow flees to the court of King
449,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Half"" of Denmark, where she remains seven years. Finally Grimhild"
450,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"learns of the place of her daughter's concealment, and tries to bring"
451,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,about a reconciliation with Gunnar and Hogni. They offer her much
452,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"treasure, if she will marry Atli. At first she refuses and thinks only"
453,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of revenge, but finally she consents and the marriage is celebrated in"
454,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Atli's land. After a time Atli, who is envious of Gunnar's riches, for"
455,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the latter had taken possession of Sigurd's hoard, invites him to his"
456,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"court. A man named ""Vingi"", who was sent with the invitation, changes"
457,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the runes of warning, which Gudrun had given him, so that they, too,"
458,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"read as an invitation. The brothers determine to accept the invitation,"
459,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and, though warned by many dreams, they set out for Atli's court, which"
460,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"they reach in due time. Vingi now breaks forth into exultations, that he"
461,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"has lured them into a snare, and is slain by Hogni with a battle axe."
462,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
463,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"As they ride to the king's hall, Atli and his sons arm themselves for"
464,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"battle, and demand Sigurd's treasure, which belongs by right to Gudrun."
465,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gunnar refuses to surrender it, and the fight begins, after some"
466,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,exchange of taunting words. Gudrun tries at first to reconcile the
467,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"combatants, but, failing, arms herself and fights on the side of her"
468,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"brothers. The battle rages furiously with great loss on both sides,"
469,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"until nearly all of the Nibelungs are killed, when Gunnar and Hogni"
470,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,are forced to yield to the power of numbers and are captured and bound.
471,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gunnar is asked, if he will purchase his life with the treasure. He"
472,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,replies that he first wishes to see Hogni's bleeding heart. At first the
473,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"heart of a slave is cut out and brought to him, but Gunnar recognizes it"
474,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"at once as that of a coward. Then they cut out Hogni's heart, who laughs"
475,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"at the pain. This Gunnar sees is the right one, and is jubilant, for now"
476,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Atli shall never obtain the treasure, as Gunnar alone knows where it is"
477,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,hid. In a rage Atli orders Gunnar to be thrown to the snakes. Though
478,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his hands are bound, Gunnar plays so sweetly with his toes on the harp,"
479,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which Gudrun has sent him, that all the snakes are lulled to sleep, with"
480,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the exception of an adder, which stings him to the heart, so that he"
481,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,dies.
482,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
483,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Atli now walks triumphantly over the dead bodies, and remarks to Gudrun"
484,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,that she alone is to blame for what has happened. She refuses his offers
485,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of peace and reconciliation, and towards evening kills her two sons"
486,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Erp"" and ""Eitil"", and serves them at the banquet, which the king gives"
487,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"for his retainers. When Atli asks for his sons, he is told that he had"
488,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,drunk their blood mixed with wine and had eaten their hearts. That night
489,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"when Atli is asleep, Gudrun takes Hogni's son ""Hniflung"", who desires"
490,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to avenge his father, and together they enter Atli's room and thrust a"
491,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"sword through his breast. Atli awakes from the pain, only to be told"
492,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,by Gudrun that she is his murderess. When he reproaches her with thus
493,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"killing her husband, she answers that she cared only for Sigurd. Atli"
494,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"now asks for a fitting burial, and on receiving the promise of this,"
495,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"expires. Gudrun carries out her promise, and burns the castle with"
496,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Atli and all his dead retainers. Other Edda songs relate the further
497,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"adventures of Gudrun, but they do not concern us here, as the"
498,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungenlied"" stops with the death of the Nibelungs."
499,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
500,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"This in brief is the story of Siegfried, as it has been handed down to"
501,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,us in the Skandinavian sources. It is universally acknowledged that
502,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"this version, though more original than the German tradition, does not"
503,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,represent the simplest and most original form of the tale; but what the
504,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"original form was, has long been and still is a matter of dispute. Two"
505,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"distinctly opposite views are held, the one seeing in the story the"
506,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"personification of the forces of nature, the other, scouting the"
507,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"possibility of a mythological interpretation, seeks a purely human"
508,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"origin for the tale, namely, a quarrel among relatives for the"
509,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"possession of treasure. The former view is the older, and obtained"
510,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,almost exclusively at one time. The latter has been gaining ground of
511,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"recent years, and is held by many of the younger students of the legend."
512,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"According to the mythological view, the maiden slumbering upon the"
513,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"lonely heights is the sun, the wall of flames surrounding her the"
514,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"morning red (""Morgenrote""). Siegfried is the youthful day who is"
515,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,destined to rouse the sun from her slumber. At the appointed time he
516,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"ascends, and before his splendor the morning red disappears. He awakens"
517,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the maiden; radiantly the sun rises from its couch and joyously greets
518,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the world of nature. But light and shade are indissolubly connected; day
519,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,changes of itself into night. When at evening the sun sinks to rest
520,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and surrounds herself once more with a wall of flames, the day again"
521,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"approaches, but no longer in the youthful form of the morning to arouse"
522,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"her from her slumber, but in the sombre shape of Gunther, to rest at her"
523,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,side. Day has turned into night; this is the meaning of the change of
524,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"forms. The wall of flame vanishes, day and sun descend into the realm of"
525,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,darkness. Under this aspect the Siegfried story is a day myth; but under
526,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"another it is a myth of the year. The dragon is the symbol of winter,"
527,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the dwarfs of darkness. Siegfried denotes the bright summer, his sword"
528,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the sunbeams. The youthful year grows up in the dark days of winder.
529,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"When its time has come, it goes forth triumphantly and destroys"
530,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the darkness and the cold of winter. Through the symbolization the
531,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,abstractions gain form and become persons; the saga is thus not a mere
532,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"allegory, but a personification of nature's forces. The treasure may"
533,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,have entered the saga through the widespread idea of the dragon as the
534,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"guardian of treasure, or it may represent the beauty of nature which"
535,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"unfolds when the season has conquered. In the last act of the saga,"
536,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried's death, Wilmanns, the best exponent of this view, sees again"
537,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,a symbolic representation of a process of nature. According to him it
538,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,signifies the death of the god of the year in winter. In the spring he
539,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"kills the dragon, in the winter he goes weary to his rest and is foully"
540,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"slain by the hostile powers of darkness. Later, when this act was"
541,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"connected with the story of Gunther's wooing Brunhild, the real meaning"
542,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"was forgotten, and Siegfried's death was attributed to the grief and"
543,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,jealousy of the insulted queen.
544,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
545,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Opposed now to the mythological interpretation is the other view already
546,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"spoken of, which denies the possibility of mythological features, and"
547,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,does not seek to trace the legend beyond the heroic stage. The best
548,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"exponent of this view is R. C. Boer, who has made a remarkable attempt"
549,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,to resolve the story into its simplest constituents. According to him
550,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the nucleus of the legend is an old story of the murder of relatives
551,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"(""Verwandienmord""), the original form being perhaps as follows. Attila"
552,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"(i.e., the enemy of Hagen under any name) is married to Hagen's sister"
553,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Grimhild or Gudrun. He invites his brother-in-law to his house, attacks"
554,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"him in the hope of obtaining his treasure, and kills him. According"
555,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to this view Hagen was originally the king, but later sinks to a"
556,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,subordinate position through the subsequent connection of the story with
557,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the Burgundians. It is of course useless to hunt for the date of such
558,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"an episode in history. Such a murder could have frequently occurred, and"
559,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,can be localized anywhere. Very early we find this Hagen story united
560,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"with the Siegfried legend. If the latter is mythological, then we have"
561,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"a heterogeneous combination, a mythical legend grafted on a purely human"
562,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"one. This Boer thinks unlikely, and presents a number of arguments to"
563,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"disprove the mythical character of the Siegfried story, into which"
564,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"we cannot enter here. He comes, however, to the conclusion, that the"
565,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried tale is likewise purely human, and consisted originally of the"
566,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"murder of relatives, that is, a repetition of the Hagen title. Siegfried"
567,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is married to Hagen's sister, and is killed by his brother-in-law"
568,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"because of his treasure. The kernel of the legend is, therefore, the"
569,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"enmity between relatives, which exists in two forms, the one in which"
570,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the son-in-law kills his father-in-law, as in the ""Helgi"" saga, the"
571,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"other in which Hagen kills his son-in-law and is killed by him, too, as"
572,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in the ""Hilde"" saga. The German tradition tries to combine the two by"
573,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"introducing the new feature, that Kriemhild causes the death of her"
574,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"relatives, in order to avenge her first husband. Boer is of the opinion"
575,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,that both the Norse and the German versions have forgotten the original
576,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"connection between the two stories, and that this connection was nothing"
577,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"more nor less than the common motive of the treasure. The same treasure,"
578,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which causes Hagen to murder Siegfried, causes his own death in turn"
579,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"through the greed of Attila. There was originally, according to Boer, no"
580,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"question of revenge, except the revenge of fate, the retribution which"
581,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,overtakes the criminal. This feeling for the irony of fate was lost
582,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"when the motive, that Hagen kills Siegfried because of his treasure,"
583,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,was replaced by the one that he does it at the request of Brunhild. This
584,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"leads Boer to the conclusion, that Brunhild did not originally belong to"
585,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the Siegfried story, but to the well-known fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty"
586,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"(""Erlosungsmurchen""), which occurs in a variety of forms. The type is"
587,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"that of a hero who rescues a maiden from a magic charm, which may take"
588,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the form of a deep sleep, as in the case of Sleeping Beauty, or of being"
589,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"sewed into a garment, as in No. 111 of Grimm's fairy tales. By the union"
590,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the two stories, i.e., the Hagen-Siegfried saga with the Sleeping"
591,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Beauty tale, Siegfried stands in relation to two women; on the one hand"
592,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his relation to Sigrdrifa-Brynhild, the maiden whom he rescues on the"
593,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"rock, on the other his marriage with Grimhild-Gudrun and his consequent"
594,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"death. This twofold relation had to be disposed of, and since his"
595,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"connection with Grimhild was decisive for his fate, his relation to"
596,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brunhild had to be changed. It could not be entirely ignored, for it"
597,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"was too well known, therefore it was given a different interpretation."
598,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried still rescues a maiden from the rock, not for himself,"
599,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"however, but for another. The exchange of forms on the part of"
600,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Siegfried and Gunther is a reminiscence of the older form. It gives the
601,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"impression, that Siegfried, and yet not Siegfried, won the bride. This"
602,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,alteration probably took place when the Burgundians were introduced into
603,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the legend. With this introduction an unlocalized saga of unknown heroes
604,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,of ancient times became one of events of world-wide importance; the fall
605,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,of a mighty race was depicted as the result of Siegfried's death. To
606,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"render this plausible, it was necessary on the one hand to idealize"
607,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the hero, so that his death should appear as a deed of horror demanding"
608,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"fearful vengeance, and on the other, to make the king of the Burgundians"
609,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"an active participator in Siegfried's death, for otherwise it would not"
610,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"seem natural, that the whole race should be exterminated for a crime"
611,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,committed by the king's brother or vassal. As the role of Brunhild's
612,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"husband had become vacant, and as Gunther had no special role, it was"
613,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,natural that it should be given to him. Boer traces very ingeniously
614,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the gradual development of this exchange of roles through the various
615,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,sources.
616,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
617,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Another method of explaining away Siegfried's relation to two women is
618,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"to identify them, and this has been done by the Seyfrid ballad. Here the"
619,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"hero rescues Kriemhild from the power of the dragon, marries her,"
620,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and then is later killed by her brothers through envy and hatred. As
621,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brunhild and Kriemhild are here united in one person, there is no need"
622,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of a wooing for the king, nor of vengeance on the part of Brunhild,"
623,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,accordingly the old motive of greed (here envy) reappears.
624,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
625,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"As to the fight with the dragon, Boer believes that it did not"
626,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"originally belong to the saga, for in none of the sources except the"
627,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,popular ballad is the fight with the dragon connected with the release
628,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of Brunhild. If the Siegfried-Hagen story is purely human, then the"
629,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"dragon cannot have originally belonged to it, but was later introduced,"
630,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,because of the widespread belief in the dragon as the guardian of
631,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"treasure, and in order to answer the question as to the provenience of"
632,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the hoard. This is, however, only one answer to the question. Another,"
633,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"widespread in German legends, is that the treasure comes from the"
634,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Nibelungs, that is, from the dwarfs. Many identify the dwarfs and the"
635,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"dragon, but this finds no support in the sources, for here the dwarfs"
636,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and Fafnir are never confused. The ""Nibelungenlied"" describes an"
637,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"adventure with each, but the treasure is only connected with the dwarfs."
638,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The ""Thidreksaga"" knows only the dragon fight but not the dwarfs, as is"
639,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,likewise the case with the Seyfrid ballad. Only in the Norse sources
640,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"do we find a contamination. The story of Hreithmar and his sons, who"
641,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"quarrel about the treasure, resembles that of Schilbung and Nibelung in"
642,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the ""Nibelungenlied"", and probably has the same source. One of the sons,"
643,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"because of his guarding the treasure, is identified with the dragon,"
644,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and so we read that Fafnir becomes a dragon, after gaining the treasure."
645,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Originally, however, he was not a dragon, but a dwarf. These two"
646,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,independent forms can be geographically localized. The dwarf legend is
647,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the more southern; it is told in detail in the ""Nibelungenlied"". The"
648,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"dragon legend probably originated in the Cimbrian peninsula, where the"
649,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Beowulf"" saga, in which the dragon fight plays such an important part,"
650,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,likewise arose.
651,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
652,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"There thus stand sharply opposed to each other two theories, one seeing"
653,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in the Siegfried saga a personification of natural forces, the other"
654,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,tracing it back to a purely human story of murder through greed. It may
655,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"be, that the true form of the original saga lies half way between"
656,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"these two views. The story of the fall of the Nibelungs, that is, their"
657,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"killing at Etzel's court, may go back to the tale of the murder of"
658,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,relatives for money. On the other hand it is hard to believe that the
659,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried saga is nothing but a repetition of the Attila motive, for"
660,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,this is too brief a formula to which to reduce the long legend of
661,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried, with its many deeds. Even if we discard the mythological"
662,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"interpretation, it is the tale of a daring hero, who is brought up in"
663,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the woods by a cunning dwarf. He kills a dragon and takes possession of
664,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his hoard, then rescues a maiden, imprisoned upon a mountain, as in the"
665,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"older Norse version and the popular ballad, or in a tower, as in the"
666,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Thidreksaga"", and surrounded either by a wall of fire, as in the"
667,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Norse, or by a large body of water, as in the ""Nibelungenlied"". After"
668,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"betrothing himself to the maiden, he sets forth in search of further"
669,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"adventures, and falls into the power of an evil race, who by their"
670,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"magic arts lure him to them, cause his destruction, and then obtain"
671,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,his treasure and the maiden for themselves. By her very name Sigrdrifa
672,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"belongs to Siegfried, just as Gunther and Gudrun-Grimhild belong"
673,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"together, and it seems hardly possible that she should have entered the"
674,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"story later, as Boer would have us believe. After all, it is largely a"
675,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"matter of belief, for it is impossible to prove positively that mythical"
676,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,elements did or did not exist in the original.
677,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
678,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,To the combined Siegfried-Nibelung story various historical elements
679,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,were added during the fifth century. At the beginning of this period the
680,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Franks were located on the left bank of the Rhine from Coblenz downward.
681,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Further up the river, that is, to the south, the Burgundians had"
682,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"established a kingdom in what is now the Rhenish Palatinate, their"
683,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"capital being Worms and their king ""Gundahar"", or ""Gundicarius"", as the"
684,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Romans called him. For twenty years the Burgundians lived on good terms
685,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"with the surrounding nations. Then, growing bolder, they suddenly"
686,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"rose against the Romans in the year 436, but the rebellion was quietly"
687,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"suppressed by the Roman general Aetius. Though defeated, the Burgundians"
688,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"were not subdued, and the very next year they broke their oaths and"
689,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,again sought to throw off the Roman yoke. This time the Romans called to
690,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"their aid the hordes of Huns, who had been growing rapidly in power and"
691,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,were already pressing hard upon the German nations from the east. Only
692,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"too glad for an excuse, the Huns poured into the land in great numbers"
693,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and practically swept the Burgundian people from the face of the earth.
694,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"According to the Roman historians, twenty thousand Burgundians were"
695,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,slain in this great battle of the Catalaunian Fields. Naturally this
696,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"catastrophe, in which a whole German nation fell before the hordes of"
697,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"invading barbarians, produced a profound impression upon the Teutonic"
698,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"world. The King Gundahar, the Gunther of the ""Nibelungenlied"", who also"
699,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"fell in the battle, became the central figure of a new legend, namely,"
700,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the story of the fall of the Burgundians.
701,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
702,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Attila is not thought to have taken part in the invasion, still, after"
703,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his death in 454, his name gradually came to be associated with the"
704,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"slaughter of the Burgundians, for a legend operates mainly with types,"
705,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and as Attila was a Hun and throughout the Middle Ages was looked upon
706,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"as the type of a cruel tyrant, greedy for conquest, it was but natural"
707,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,for him to play the rÃ´le assigned to him in the legend. Quite plausible
708,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,is Boer's explanation of the entrance of Attila into the legend. The
709,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Thidreksaga"" locates him in Seest in Westphalia. Now this province once"
710,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"bore the name of ""Hunaland"", and by a natural confusion, because of"
711,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the similarity of the names, ""Huna"" and ""Huns"", Attila, who is the"
712,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"chief representative of Hunnish power, was connected with the legend"
713,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and located at Seest. This would show that the original extension of the
714,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"legend was slight, as Xanten, the home of Hagen, is but seventy miles"
715,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,from Seest. The original form would then be that Hagen was slain by a
716,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"king of ""Hunaland"", then because history relates that the Burgundians"
717,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"were slain by the Huns, the similarity of the names led to the"
718,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,introduction of Attila and the identification of the Nibelungs with the
719,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Burgundians. The fact, too, that the Franks rapidly took possession"
720,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,of the district depopulated by the crushing defeat of the Burgundians
721,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"likewise aided the confusion, and thus the Franks became the natural"
722,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"heirs of the legend concerning the death of Gunther, and so we read of"
723,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the fall of the Nibelungs, a name that is wholly Frankish in character."
724,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,This identification led also to Attila's being considered the avenger of
725,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried's death. Poetic justice, however, demands that the slaughter"
726,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the Burgundians at the hands of Attila be also avenged. The rumor,"
727,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"that Attila's death was not natural, but that he had been murdered by"
728,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his wife Ildico (""Hildiko""), gave the necessary features to round out"
729,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the story. As Kriemhild was the sister of the Burgundian kings, it was"
730,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"but natural to explain her killing of Attila, as described in the Norse"
731,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"versions, by her desire to avenge her brothers."
732,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
733,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"In our ""Nibelungenlied"", however, it is no longer Attila, but Kriemhild,"
734,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"who is the central figure of the tragedy. Etzel, as he is called here,"
735,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"has sunk to the insignificant role of a stage king, a perfectly passive"
736,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,observer of the fight raging around him. This change was brought about
737,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"perhaps by the introduction of Dietrich of Berne, the most imposing"
738,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,figure of all Germanic heroic lore. The necessity of providing him
739,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"with a role corresponding to his importance, coupled with a growing"
740,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,repugnance on the part of the proud Franks to acknowledge defeat at the
741,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"hands of the Huns, caused the person of Attila to dwindle in importance."
742,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gradually, too, the role played by Kriemhild was totally changed."
743,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Instead of being the avenger of her brothers, as depicted in the Norse"
744,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"versions, she herself becomes the cause of their destruction. Etzel"
745,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is not only innocent of any desire to harm the Nibelungs, but is even"
746,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,ignorant of the revenge planned by his wife. This change in her role was
747,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,probably due to the feeling that it was incumbent upon her to avenge the
748,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,murder of Siegfried.
749,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
750,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Our ""Nibelungenlied"" knows but little of the adventures of Siegfried's"
751,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,youth as depicted in the Norse versions. The theme of the poem is no
752,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"longer the love of Sigurd, the homeless wanderer, for the majestic"
753,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Valkyrie Brunhild, but the love idyll of Siegfried, the son of the king"
754,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the Netherlands, and the dainty Burgundian princess Kriemhild."
755,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,The poem has forgotten Siegfried's connection with Brunhild; it knows
756,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"nothing of his penetrating the wall of flames to awake and rescue her,"
757,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,nothing of the betrothal of the two. In our poem Siegfried is carefully
758,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"reared at his father's court in the Netherlands, and sets out with great"
759,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,pomp for the court of the Burgundians. In the Norse version he naturally
760,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"remains at Gunther's court after his marriage, but in our poem he"
761,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,returns to the Netherlands with his bride. This necessitates the
762,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"introduction of several new scenes to depict his arrival home, the"
763,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"invitation to the feast at Worms, and the reception of the guests on the"
764,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,part of the Burgundians.
765,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
766,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"In the ""Nibelungenlied"" the athletic sports, as an obstacle to the"
767,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"winning of Brunhild, take the place of the wall of flames of the older"
768,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Norse versions. Siegfried and Gunther no longer change forms, but"
769,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Siegfried dons the ""Tarnkappe"", which renders him invisible, so that"
770,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"while Gunther makes the motions, Siegfried really does the work, a thing"
771,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,which is rather difficult to imagine. The quarrel of the two queens is
772,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"likewise very differently depicted in the ""Nibelungenlied"" from what it"
773,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,is in the Norse version. In the latter it takes place while the
774,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"ladies are bathing in the river, and is brought on by the arrogance of"
775,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brunhild, who refuses to stand lower down the stream and bathe in the"
776,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"water flowing from Gudrun to her. In the ""Thidreksaga"" it occurs in the"
777,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"seclusion of the ladies' apartments, but in our poem it culminates in"
778,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"front of the cathedral before the assembled court, and requires as its"
779,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,background all the pomp and splendor of medieval chivalry. With a master
780,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"hand and a wonderful knowledge of female character, the author depicts"
781,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,the gradual progress of the quarrel until it terminates in a magnificent
782,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"scene of wounded pride and malignant hatred. Kriemhild, as usual, plays"
783,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the more important part, and, while standing up for her rights, tries in"
784,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,every way to conciliate Brunhild and not to hurt her feelings. At
785,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"last, however, stung by the taunts of the latter, she in turn loses her"
786,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"patience, bursts out with the whole story of the twofold deception to"
787,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"which Brunhild has been subjected, and then triumphantly sweeps into"
788,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the church, leaving her rival stunned and humiliated by the news she"
789,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,has heard. In the Norse tradition the scene serves merely to enlighten
790,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Brunhild as to the deception played upon her. In the ""Nibelungenlied"" it"
791,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"becomes the real cause of Siegfried's death, for Brunhild plans to kill"
792,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Siegfried to avenge the public slight done to her. She has no other
793,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"reason, as Siegfried swears that there had been no deception. Brunhild"
794,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"appeals to us much less in the ""Nibelungenlied"" than in the Norse"
795,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,version. In the latter she feels herself deeply wronged by Siegfried's
796,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"faithlessness, and resolves on his death because she will not be the"
797,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,wife of two men. In our poem she has no reason for wishing his death
798,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"except her wounded pride. In the ""Nibelungenlied"", too, she disappears"
799,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"from view after Siegfried's death, whereas in the Norse tradition she"
800,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,ascends his funeral pyre and dies at his side.
801,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
802,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,The circumstances of Siegfried's death are likewise totally different
803,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"in the two versions. In the Norse, as we have seen, he is murdered while"
804,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"asleep in bed, by Gunnar's younger brother Gutthorm. In our poem he is"
805,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"killed by Hagen, while bending over a spring to drink. This is preceded"
806,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,by a scene in which Hagen treacherously induces Kriemhild to mark the
807,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"one vulnerable spot on Siegfried's body, on the plea of protecting"
808,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"him. This deepens the tragedy, and renders Kriemhild's misery and"
809,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"self-reproaches the greater. After Siegfried's burial his father,"
810,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"who had also come to Worms with his son, vainly endeavors to persuade"
811,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Kriemhild to return with him to the Netherlands. Her refusal is
812,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"unnatural in the extreme, for she had reigned there ten years or"
813,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"more with Siegfried, and had left her little son behind, and yet she"
814,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"relinquishes all this and remains with her brothers, whom she knows to"
815,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,be the murderers of her husband. This is evidently a reminiscence of
816,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"an earlier form in which Siegfried was a homeless adventurer, as in the"
817,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Thidreksaga""."
818,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
819,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The second half of the tale, the destruction of the Nibelungs,"
820,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is treated of very briefly in the early Norse versions, but the"
821,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungenlied"", which knows so little of Siegfried's youth, has"
822,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"developed and enlarged upon the story, until it overshadows the first"
823,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,part in length and importance and gives the name to the whole poem.
824,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,The main difference between the two versions is that in the older
825,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Norse tradition it is Attila who invites the Nibelungs to his court and
826,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"attacks them in order to gain possession of the treasure, while Gudrun"
827,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"(Kriemhild) first tries to reconcile the warring parties, and, not"
828,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"succeeding in this, snatches up a sword and fights on the side of"
829,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,her brothers and later kills her husband as an act of revenge. In the
830,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Thidreksaga"" and the ""Nibelungenlied"", however, she is the instigator"
831,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the fight and the cause of her brothers' death, and finally suffers"
832,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"death herself at the hands of Master Hildebrand, who is furious that"
833,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,such noble heroes should fall at a woman's hand. The second part of
834,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the poem is grewsome reading at best, with its weltering corpses and"
835,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,torrents of blood. The horror is relieved only by the grim humor of
836,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Hagen and by the charming scene at Rudeger's court, where the young"
837,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,prince Giselher is betrothed to Rudeger's daughter. Rudeger is without
838,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,doubt the most tragic figure of this part. He is bound on the one hand
839,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,by his oath of allegiance to Kriemhild and on the other by ties of
840,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,friendship to the Burgundians. His agony of mind at the dilemma in which
841,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Kriemhild's command to attack the Burgundians places him is pitiful.
842,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Divided between love and duty, the conviction that he must fulfill his"
843,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"vow, cost what it may, gradually forces itself upon him and he rushes to"
844,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,his death in combat with his dearest friends.
845,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
846,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Towering above all others in its gloomy grandeur stands the figure of
847,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Hagen, the real hero of the second half of the poem. Fully aware that"
848,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"he is going to his death, he nevertheless scorns to desert his"
849,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"companions-in-arms, and awaits the fate in store for him with a stoicism"
850,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,that would do honor to a Spartan. He calmly accepts the consequences of
851,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"his crime, and to the last mocks and scoffs at Kriemhild, until her fury"
852,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,knows no bounds. No character shows so little the refining influences of
853,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Christianity as does his. In all essential respects he is still the same
854,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"old gigantic Teuton, who meets us in the earliest forms of the legend."
855,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
856,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"As to the various minor characters, many of which appear only in the"
857,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungenlied"", space will not permit of their discussion here,"
858,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,although they will be treated of briefly in the notes. Suffice it to
859,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"say, that the ""Nibelungenlied"" has introduced a number of effective"
860,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"scenes for the purpose of bringing some of them, especially Folker and"
861,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Dankwart, into prominence. Among the best of these are, first, the night"
862,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"watch, when Folker first plays the Burgundians to sleep with his violin,"
863,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and then stands guard with Hagen, thus preventing the surprise planned"
864,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"by Kriemhild; further, the visit to the church on the following morning,"
865,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,when the men of both parties clash; and lastly the tournament between
866,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the Huns and the Burgundians, which gives the author an excellent chance"
867,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,to show the prowess of the various heroes.
868,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
869,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Let us pass now to the consideration of the strophic form of the
870,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungenlied"". The two Danish ballads of ""Grimhild's Revenge"""
871,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"(""Grimhild's Haevn""), which are based upon the first combination of"
872,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the Low German, i.e., Saxon, and the Rhenish traditions, prove that the"
873,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"strophe is considerably older than the preserved redactions of our poem,"
874,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,and that it was probably of Saxon origin. The metrical form goes back
875,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,most probably to the four-accented verse of the poet Otfrid of the ninth
876,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"century, although some have thought that Latin hymns, others that the"
877,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"French epic verse, may have been of influence. The direct derivation"
878,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"from Otfrid seems, however, the most plausible, as it accounts for the"
879,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"importance of the caesura, which generally marks a pause in the"
880,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"sense, as well as in the verse, and also for its masculine ending. The"
881,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungen"" strophe consists of four long lines separated by a caesura"
882,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,into two distinct halves. The first half of each line contains four
883,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"accents, the fourth falling upon the last syllable. This last stress,"
884,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"however, is not, as a rule as strong as the others, the effect being"
885,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,somewhat like that of a feminine ending. On this account some speak of
886,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"three accents in the first half line, with a feminine ending. The fourth"
887,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"stress is, however, too strong to be thus disregarded, but because of"
888,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,its lighter character is best marked with a grave accent. The second
889,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,half of each line ends in a masculine rhyme. The first three lines have
890,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"each three stresses in the second half, while the second half of the"
891,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,fourth line has four accents to mark the end of the strophe. This
892,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,longer fourth line is one of the most marked characteristics of the
893,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""Nibelungen"" strophe. The rhymes are arranged in the order of ""a"", ""a"","
894,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"""b"", ""b"", though in a few isolated cases near the end of the poem but"
895,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,one rhyme is used throughout the strophe.
896,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
897,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,The opening lines of the poem may serve to illustrate the strophic form
898,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and scansion, and at the same time will give the reader an idea of the"
899,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,Middle High German language in which the poem is written:

937,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"German poems, as this practice of using the final ""e"" in rhyme began to"
938,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"die out in the twelfth century, though occasionally found throughout the"
939,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"period. The rhymes are, as a rule, quite exact, the few cases of impure"
940,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,rhymes being mainly those in which short and long vowels are rhymed
941,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"together, e.g. ""mich"": ""rich"" or ""man"": ""han"". Caesural rhymes are"
942,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"frequently met with, and were considered by Lachmann to be the marks of"
943,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"interpolated strophes, a view no longer held. A further peculiarity"
944,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of the ""Nibelungen"" strophe is the frequent omission of the unaccented"
945,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,syllable in the second half of the last line of the strophe between the
946,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"second and third stresses. Examples of this will be found in the second,"

949,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"The language of the ""Nibelungenlied"" is the so-called Middle High"
950,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"German, that is, the High German written and spoken in the period"
951,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"between 1100 and 1500, the language of the great romances of chivalry"
952,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"and of the ""Minnesingers"". More exactly, the poem is written in the"
953,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Austrian dialect of the close of the twelfth century, but contains many"
954,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"archaisms, which point to the fact of its having undergone a number of"
955,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,revisions.
956,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
957,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"In closing this brief study of the ""Nibelungenlied"", just a word or"
958,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"two further with reference to the poem, its character, and its place in"
959,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"German literature. Its theme is the ancient Teutonic ideal of ""Treue"""
960,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"(faithfulness or fidelity), which has found here its most magnificent"
961,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"portrayal; faithfulness unto death, the loyalty of the vassal for his"
962,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"lord, as depicted in Hagen, the fidelity of the wife for her husband,"
963,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"as shown by Kriemhild, carried out with unhesitating consistency to the"
964,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"bitter end. This is not the gallantry of medieval chivalry, which colors"
965,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"so largely the opening scenes of the poem, but the heroic valor, the"
966,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"death-despising stoicism of the ancient Germans, before which the"
967,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"masters of the world, the all-conquering Romans, were compelled to bow."
968,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
969,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"In so far as the ""Nibelungenlied"" has forgotten most of the history of"
970,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"the youthful Siegfried, and knows nothing of his love for Brunhild, it"
971,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"is a torso, but so grand withal, that one hardly regrets the loss of"
972,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,these integral elements of the old saga. As it is a working over of
973,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"originally separate lays, it is not entirely homogeneous, and contains"
974,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"not a few contradictions. In spite of these faults, however, which a"
975,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"close study reveals, it is nevertheless the grandest product of Middle"
976,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"High German epic poetry, and deservedly the most popular poem of older"
977,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"German literature. It lacks, to be sure, the grace of diction found in"
978,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"Gottfried von Strassburg's ""Tristan und Isolde"", the detailed and often"
979,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,magnificent descriptions of armor and dress to be met with in the epics
980,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,of Hartman von Ouwe; it is wanting in the lofty philosophy of Wolfram
981,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"von Eschenbach's ""Parzival"", and does not, as this latter, lead the"
982,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,reader into the realms of religious doubts and struggles. It is imposing
983,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"through its very simplicity, through the grandeur of the story, which"
984,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,it does not seek to adorn and decorate. It nowhere pauses to analyze
985,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,motives nor to give us a picture of inner conflict as modern authors are
986,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"fond of doing. Its characters are impulsive and prompt in action, and"
987,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"when they have once acted, waste no time in useless regret or remorse."
988,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,
989,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"It resembles the older ""Spielmannsdichtung"", or minstrel poetry, in the"
990,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"terseness and vigor of its language and in the lack of poetic imagery,"
991,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,but it is free from the coarseness and vulgar and grotesque humor of the
992,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,latter. It approaches the courtly epic in its introduction of the pomp
993,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"of courtly ceremonial, but this veneer of chivalry is very thin, and"
994,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,beneath the outward polish of form the heart beats as passionately and
995,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"wildly as in the days of Herman, the Cheruscan chief. There are perhaps"
996,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"greater poems in literature than the ""Nibelungenlied"", but few so"
997,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"majestic in conception, so sublime in their tragedy, so simple in their"
998,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,"execution, and so national in their character, as this great popular"
999,INTRODUCTORY SKETCH,epic of German literature.

1055,ADVENTURE I (2),In Burgundy there grew so noble a maid that in all the lands none fairer
1056,ADVENTURE I (2),"might there be. Kriemhild (3) was she called; a comely woman she became,"
1057,ADVENTURE I (2),for whose sake many a knight must needs lose his life. Well worth the
1058,ADVENTURE I (2),"loving was this winsome maid. Bold knights strove for her, none bare her"
1059,ADVENTURE I (2),hate. Her peerless body was beautiful beyond degree; the courtly virtues
1060,ADVENTURE I (2),of this maid of noble birth would have adorned many another woman too.

1064,ADVENTURE I (2),"chosen knight. This lady was their sister, the princes had her in their"
1065,ADVENTURE I (2),"care. The lordings were free in giving, of race high-born, passing bold"
1066,ADVENTURE I (2),"of strength were they, these chosen knights. Their realm hight Burgundy."
1067,ADVENTURE I (2),Great marvels they wrought hereafter in Etzel's (7) land. At Worms (8)
1068,ADVENTURE I (2),upon the Rhine they dwelt with all their power. Proud knights from out
1069,ADVENTURE I (2),"their lands served them with honor, until their end was come. Thereafter"

1076,ADVENTURE I (2),"allegiance the best of warriors, of whom tales were ever told, strong"
1077,ADVENTURE I (2),"and brave, fearless in the sharp strife. Hagen (11) there was of Troneg,"

1081,ADVENTURE I (2),"a chosen knight; the lords Sindolt and Hunolt, liegemen of these three"
1082,ADVENTURE I (2),"kings, had rule of the court and of its honors. Thereto had they many"
1083,ADVENTURE I (2),"a warrior whose name I cannot tell. Dankwart was marshal; his nephew,"
1084,ADVENTURE I (2),"Ortwin, seneschal unto the king; Sindolt was cupbearer, a chosen knight;"
1085,ADVENTURE I (2),Hunolt served as chamberlain; well they wot how to fill these lofty
1086,ADVENTURE I (2),"stations. Of the forces of the court and its far-reaching might, of"

1091,ADVENTURE I (2),"In the midst of these high honors Kriemhild dreamed a dream, of how she"
1092,ADVENTURE I (2),"trained a falcon, strong, fair, and wild, which, before her very eyes,"
1093,ADVENTURE I (2),two eagles rent to pieces. No greater sorrow might chance to her in all

1095,ADVENTURE I (2),"unfold it to the dutiful maid in better wise than this: ""The falcon"
1096,ADVENTURE I (2),"which thou trainest, that is a noble man, but thou must needs lose him"
1097,ADVENTURE I (2),"soon, unless so be that God preserve him."""
1098,ADVENTURE I (2),
1099,ADVENTURE I (2),"""Why speakest thou to me of men, dear brother mine? I would fain ever be"
1100,ADVENTURE I (2),"without a warrior's love. So fair will I remain until my death, that I"
1101,ADVENTURE I (2),"shall never gain woe from love of man."""
1102,ADVENTURE I (2),
1103,ADVENTURE I (2),"""Now forswear this not too roundly,"" spake the mother in reply. ""If ever"
1104,ADVENTURE I (2),"thou shalt wax glad of heart in this world, that will chance through the"
1105,ADVENTURE I (2),"love of man. Passing fair wilt thou become, if God grant thee a right"
1106,ADVENTURE I (2),"worthy knight."""
1107,ADVENTURE I (2),
1108,ADVENTURE I (2),"""I pray you leave this speech,"" spake she, ""my lady. Full oft hath it"
1109,ADVENTURE I (2),"been seen in many a wife, how joy may at last end in sorrow. I shall"
1110,ADVENTURE I (2),"avoid them both, then can it ne'er go ill with me."""
1111,ADVENTURE I (2),
1112,ADVENTURE I (2),Thus in her heart Kriemhild forsware all love. Many a happy day
1113,ADVENTURE I (2),thereafter the maiden lived without that she wist any whom she would
1114,ADVENTURE I (2),care to love. In after days she became with worship a valiant here's
1115,ADVENTURE I (2),bride. He was the selfsame falcon which she beheld in her dream that her

1163,ENDNOTES:,"(8)  ""Worms"" is the ancient ""Borbetomagus"", which in the first"
1164,ENDNOTES:,century B.C. was the chief city of the German tribe of the
1165,ENDNOTES:,"""Vangioni"".  In the fifth century it was the capital of the"

1167,ENDNOTES:,"Merovingians rebuilt it, and in the seventh century it"

1180,ENDNOTES:,"(11) ""Hagen of Troneg"".  Troneg is probably a corruption of the"
1181,ENDNOTES:,"name of the Latin colony, ""colonia Trajana"", on the Lower"
1182,ENDNOTES:,"Rhine, which as early as the fifth century was written as"
1183,ENDNOTES:,"""Troja"", giving rise to the legend that the Franks were"

1185,ENDNOTES:,"further corrupted to ""Tronje"" and ""Tronege"".  Hagen was"
1186,ENDNOTES:,therefore originally a Frank and had no connection with the
1187,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundian kings, as the lack of alliteration also goes to"
1188,ENDNOTES:,show.  Boer thinks that not Siegfried but Hagen originally
1189,ENDNOTES:,"lived at Xanten (see note 3 to Adventure II), as this was"
1190,ENDNOTES:,often called Troja Francorum. When the Hagen story was
1191,ENDNOTES:,connected with the Burgundians and Hagen became either their
1192,ENDNOTES:,"brother or their vassal, his home was transferred to Worms"
1193,ENDNOTES:,"and Siegfried was located at Xanten, as he had no especial"

1197,ENDNOTES:,"(12) ""Dankwart"" is not an historical character nor one that"

1199,ENDNOTES:,"from another saga, where he played the principal role as"
1200,ENDNOTES:,"Droege (ZsfdA. 48, 499) thinks.  Boer considers him to be"
1201,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen's double, invented to play a part that would naturally"
1202,ENDNOTES:,"fall to Hagen's share, were he not otherwise engaged at the"
1203,ENDNOTES:,"moment.  In our poem he is called ""Dancwart der snelle"", a"
1204,ENDNOTES:,"word that has proved a stumbling-block to translators,"
1205,ENDNOTES:,"because in modern German it means 'speedy', 'swift'.  Its"
1206,ENDNOTES:,"original meaning was, however, 'brave', 'warlike', although"
1207,ENDNOTES:,the later meaning is already found in M.H.G.  In all such
1208,ENDNOTES:,"doubtful cases the older meaning has been preferred, unless"
1209,ENDNOTES:,"the context forbids, and the word 'doughty' has been chosen"
1210,ENDNOTES:,to translate it.
1211,ENDNOTES:,"(13) ""Ortwin of Metz"" appears also in the ""Eckenlied"","
1212,ENDNOTES:,"""Waltharius"", and in ""Biterolf"".  He is most likely a late"
1213,ENDNOTES:,"introduction (but see Piper, I, 44).  Rieger thinks that he"
1214,ENDNOTES:,"belonged to a wealthy family ""De Metis"".  Though the ""i"" is"
1215,ENDNOTES:,"long in the original, and Simrock uses the form ""Ortewein"""
1216,ENDNOTES:,"in his translation, the spelling with short ""i"" has been"
1217,ENDNOTES:,"chosen, as the lack of accent tends to shorten the vowel in"
1218,ENDNOTES:,such names.
1219,ENDNOTES:,"(14) ""Gere"" is likewise a late introduction.  He is perhaps the"
1220,ENDNOTES:,"historical Margrave Gere (965) of East Saxony, whom Otto the"

1232,ENDNOTES:,"the noble family of the same name.  It is most likely,"
1233,ENDNOTES:,"however, that this fact caused Folker to be connected with"
1234,ENDNOTES:,"Alzei.  In the ""Thidreksaga"" Folker did not play the role of"

1247,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE II. Of Siegfried.
1248,ENDNOTES:,
1249,ENDNOTES:,In the Netherlands there grew the child of a noble king (his father had
1250,ENDNOTES:,"for name Siegmund, (1) his mother Siegelind), (2) in a mighty castle,"
1251,ENDNOTES:,"known far and wide, in the lowlands of the Rhine: Xanten, (3) men called"
1252,ENDNOTES:,"it. Of this hero I sing, how fair he grew. Free he was of every blemish."
1253,ENDNOTES:,"Strong and famous he later became, this valiant man. Ho! What great"
1254,ENDNOTES:,worship he won in this world! Siegfried hight this good and doughty
1255,ENDNOTES:,knight. Full many kingdoms did he put to the test through his warlike
1256,ENDNOTES:,mood. Through his strength of body he rode into many lands. Ho! What
1257,ENDNOTES:,bold warriors he after found in the Burgundian land! Mickle wonders
1258,ENDNOTES:,"might one tell of Siegfried in his prime, in youthful days; what honors"
1259,ENDNOTES:,he received and how fair of body he. The most stately women held him
1260,ENDNOTES:,in their love; with the zeal which was his due men trained him. But of
1261,ENDNOTES:,"himself what virtues he attained! Truly his father's lands were honored,"
1262,ENDNOTES:,that he was found in all things of such right lordly mind. Now was he
1263,ENDNOTES:,become of the age that he might ride to court. Gladly the people saw
1264,ENDNOTES:,"him, many a maid wished that his desire might ever bear him hither. Enow"
1265,ENDNOTES:,gazed on him with favor; of this the prince was well aware. Full seldom
1266,ENDNOTES:,was the youth allowed to ride without a guard of knights. Siegmund and
1267,ENDNOTES:,Siegelind bade deck him out in brave attire. The older knights who were
1268,ENDNOTES:,"acquaint with courtly custom, had him in their care. Well therefore"
1269,ENDNOTES:,might he win both folk and land.
1270,ENDNOTES:,
1271,ENDNOTES:,Now he was of the strength that he bare weapons well. Whatever he needed
1272,ENDNOTES:,"thereto, of this he had enow. With purpose he began to woo fair ladies;"
1273,ENDNOTES:,these bold Siegfried courted well in proper wise. Then bade Siegmund
1274,ENDNOTES:,"have cried to all his men, that he would hold a feasting with his loving"
1275,ENDNOTES:,kindred. The tidings thereof men brought into the lands of other kings.
1276,ENDNOTES:,To the strangers and the home-folk he gave steeds and armor. Wheresoever
1277,ENDNOTES:,"any was found who, because of his birth, should become a knight, these"
1278,ENDNOTES:,noble youths were summoned to the land for the feasting. Here with the
1279,ENDNOTES:,youthful prince they gained the knightly sword. Wonders might one tell
1280,ENDNOTES:,of this great feast; Siegmund and Siegelind wist well how to gain great
1281,ENDNOTES:,"worship with their gifts, of which their hands dealt out great store."
1282,ENDNOTES:,Wherefore one beheld many strangers riding to their realm. Four hundred
1283,ENDNOTES:,sword-thanes (4) were to put on knightly garb with Siegfried. Many a
1284,ENDNOTES:,"fair maid was aught but idle with the work, for he was beloved of them"
1285,ENDNOTES:,"all. Many precious stones the ladies inlaid on the gold, which together"
1286,ENDNOTES:,with the edging they would work upon the dress of the proud young
1287,ENDNOTES:,"warriors, for this must needs be done."
1288,ENDNOTES:,
1289,ENDNOTES:,"The host bade make benches for the many valiant men, for the midsummer"
1290,ENDNOTES:,"festival, (5) at which Siegfried should gain the name of knight. Then"
1291,ENDNOTES:,full many a noble knight and many a high-born squire did hie them to
1292,ENDNOTES:,"the minster. Right were the elders in that they served the young, as had"
1293,ENDNOTES:,been done to them afore. Pastimes they had and hope of much good cheer.
1294,ENDNOTES:,To the honor of God a mass was sung; then there rose from the people
1295,ENDNOTES:,"full great a press, as the youths were made knights in courtly wise,"
1296,ENDNOTES:,with such great honors as might not ever lightly be again. Then they
1297,ENDNOTES:,ran to where they found saddled many a steed. In Siegmund's court the
1298,ENDNOTES:,hurtling (6) waxed so fierce that both palace (7) and hall were heard
1299,ENDNOTES:,to ring; the high-mettled warriors clashed with mighty sound. From young
1300,ENDNOTES:,"and old one heard many a shock, so that the splintering of the shafts"
1301,ENDNOTES:,reechoed to the clouds. Truncheons (8) were seen flying out before
1302,ENDNOTES:,the palace from the hand of many a knight. This was done with zeal. At
1303,ENDNOTES:,length the host bade cease the tourney and the steeds were led away.
1304,ENDNOTES:,Upon the turf one saw all to-shivered (9) many a mighty buckler and
1305,ENDNOTES:,great store of precious stones from the bright spangles (10) of the
1306,ENDNOTES:,shields. Through the hurtling this did hap.
1307,ENDNOTES:,
1308,ENDNOTES:,Then the guests of the host betook them to where men bade them sit. With
1309,ENDNOTES:,"good cheer they refreshed them and with the very best of wine, of which"
1310,ENDNOTES:,one bare frill plenty. To the strangers and the home-folk was shown
1311,ENDNOTES:,"worship enow. Though much pastime they had throughout the day, many of"
1312,ENDNOTES:,"the strolling folk forsware all rest. They served for the largess, which"
1313,ENDNOTES:,"men found there richly, whereby Siegmund's whole land was decked with"
1314,ENDNOTES:,"praise. Then bade the king enfeoff Siegfried, the youth, with land"
1315,ENDNOTES:,"and castles, as he himself had done. Much his hand bestowed upon the"
1316,ENDNOTES:,"sword-companions. The journey liked them well, that to this land they"
1317,ENDNOTES:,"were come. The feasting lasted until the seventh day. Siegelind,"
1318,ENDNOTES:,"the noble queen, for the love of her son, dealt out ruddy gold in"
1319,ENDNOTES:,time-honored wise. Full well she wot how to make him beloved of the
1320,ENDNOTES:,folk. Scarce could a poor man be found among the strolling mimes. Steeds
1321,ENDNOTES:,"and raiment were scattered by their hand, as if they were to live not"
1322,ENDNOTES:,one more day. I trow that never did serving folk use such great bounty.
1323,ENDNOTES:,With worshipful honors the company departed hence. Of the mighty barons
1324,ENDNOTES:,"the tale doth tell that they desired the youth unto their lord, but of"
1325,ENDNOTES:,"this the stately knight, Sir Siegfried, listed naught. Forasmuch as both"
1326,ENDNOTES:,"Siegmund and Siegelind were still alive, the dear child of them twain"
1327,ENDNOTES:,"wished not to wear a crown, but fain would he become a lord against all"
1328,ENDNOTES:,"the deeds of force within his lands, whereof the bold and daring knight"
1329,ENDNOTES:,was sore adread.

1371,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE III. How Siegfried Came to Worms.
1372,ENDNOTES:,
1373,ENDNOTES:,It was seldom that sorrow of heart perturbed the prince. He heard tales
1374,ENDNOTES:,"told of how there lived in Burgundy a comely maid, fashioned wondrous"
1375,ENDNOTES:,"fair, from whom he thereafter gained much of joy, but suffering, too."
1376,ENDNOTES:,Her beauty out of measure was known far and wide. So many a here heard
1377,ENDNOTES:,"of her noble mind, that it alone brought many a guest (1) to Gunther's"
1378,ENDNOTES:,"land. But however many were seen wooing for her love, Kriemhild never"
1379,ENDNOTES:,confessed within her heart that she listed any for a lover. He was
1380,ENDNOTES:,"still a stranger to her, whose rule she later owned. Then did the son of"
1381,ENDNOTES:,Siegelind aspire to lofty love; the wooing of all others was to his but
1382,ENDNOTES:,"as the wind, for well he wot how to gain a lady fair. In later days the"
1383,ENDNOTES:,noble Kriemhild became bold Siegfried's bride. Kinsmen and liegemen enow
1384,ENDNOTES:,"advised him, since he would have hope of constant love, that he woo"
1385,ENDNOTES:,"one who was his peer. At this bold Siegfried spake: ""Then will I choose"
1386,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild, the fair maid of Burgundy, for her beauty beyond measure."
1387,ENDNOTES:,"This I know full well, never was emperor so mighty, and he would have a"
1388,ENDNOTES:,"wife, that it would not beseem him to love this noble queen."""
1389,ENDNOTES:,
1390,ENDNOTES:,Tidings of this reached Siegmund's ear; through the talk of the
1391,ENDNOTES:,courtiers he was made ware of the wish of his son. Full loth it was to
1392,ENDNOTES:,"the king, that his child would woo the glorious maid. Siegelind heard it"
1393,ENDNOTES:,"too, the wife of the noble king. Greatly she feared for her child, for"
1394,ENDNOTES:,full well she knew Gunther and his men. Therefore they sought to turn
1395,ENDNOTES:,"the hero from this venture. Up spake then the daring Siegfried: ""Dear"
1396,ENDNOTES:,"father mine, I would fain ever be without the love of noble dames, if I"
1397,ENDNOTES:,may not woo her in whom my heart hath great delight; whatsoever any may
1398,ENDNOTES:,"aver, it will avail but naught."""
1399,ENDNOTES:,
1400,ENDNOTES:,"""And thou wilt not turn back,"" spake the king, ""then am I in sooth glad"
1401,ENDNOTES:,"of thy will and will help thee bring it to pass, as best I may. Yet hath"
1402,ENDNOTES:,this King Gunther full many a haughty man. If there were none else but
1403,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen, the doughty knight, he can use such arrogance that I fear me it"
1404,ENDNOTES:,"will repent us sore, if we woo this high-born maid."""
1405,ENDNOTES:,
1406,ENDNOTES:,"Then Siegfried made reply: ""Wherefore need that hinder us? What I may"
1407,ENDNOTES:,"not obtain from them in friendly wise, that my hand and its strength can"
1408,ENDNOTES:,"gain. I trow that 1 can wrest from him both folk and land."""
1409,ENDNOTES:,
1410,ENDNOTES:,"To this Prince Siegmund replied: ""Thy speech liketh me not, for if this"
1411,ENDNOTES:,"tale were told upon the Rhine, then durst thou never ride unto that"
1412,ENDNOTES:,land. Long time have Gunther and Gernot been known to me. By force may
1413,ENDNOTES:,"none win the maid, of this have I been well assured; but wilt thou ride"
1414,ENDNOTES:,"with warriors unto this land, and we still have aught of friends, they"
1415,ENDNOTES:,"shall be summoned soon."""
1416,ENDNOTES:,
1417,ENDNOTES:,"""It is not to my mind,"" spake again Siegfried, ""that warriors should"
1418,ENDNOTES:,"follow me to the Rhine, as if for battle, that I constrain thereby the"
1419,ENDNOTES:,noble maid. My single hand can win her well--with eleven (2) comrades
1420,ENDNOTES:,"I will fare to Gunther's land; thereto shalt thou help me, Father"
1421,ENDNOTES:,"Siegmund."" Then to his knights they gave for garments furs both gray and"
1422,ENDNOTES:,vair. (3)
1423,ENDNOTES:,
1424,ENDNOTES:,Now his mother Siegelind also heard the tale. She began to make dole for
1425,ENDNOTES:,"her loved child, whom she feared to lose through Gunther's men. Sorely"
1426,ENDNOTES:,the noble queen gan weep. Lord Siegfried hied him straightway to where
1427,ENDNOTES:,"he saw her; to his mother he spake in gentle wise: ""Lady, ye must not"
1428,ENDNOTES:,weep for me; naught have I to fear from all his fighting men. I pray
1429,ENDNOTES:,"you, speed me on my journey to the Burgundian land, that I and my"
1430,ENDNOTES:,warriors may have array such as proud heroes can wear with honor; for
1431,ENDNOTES:,"this I will say you gramercy i' faith."""
1432,ENDNOTES:,
1433,ENDNOTES:,"""Since naught will turn thee,"" spake then the Lady Siegelind, ""so will I"
1434,ENDNOTES:,"speed thee on thy journey, mine only child, with the best of weeds that"
1435,ENDNOTES:,"ever knight did wear, thee and thy comrades. Ye shall have enow."""
1436,ENDNOTES:,
1437,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, the youth, then made low obeisance to the queen. He spake:"
1438,ENDNOTES:,"""None but twelve warriors will I have upon the way. Let raiment be"
1439,ENDNOTES:,"made ready for them, I pray, for I would fain see how it standeth with"
1440,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild."""
1441,ENDNOTES:,
1442,ENDNOTES:,"Then sate fair ladies night and day. Few enow of them, I trow, did ease"
1443,ENDNOTES:,"them, till Siegfried's weeds had all been wrought. Nor would he desist"
1444,ENDNOTES:,from faring forth. His father bade adorn the knightly garb in which his
1445,ENDNOTES:,"son should ride forth from Siegmund's land. The shining breastplates,"
1446,ENDNOTES:,"too, were put in trim, also the stanch helmets and their shields both"
1447,ENDNOTES:,fair and broad. Now their journey to the Burgundian land drew near;
1448,ENDNOTES:,man and wife began to fear lest they never should come home again. The
1449,ENDNOTES:,heroes bade lade their sumpters with weapons and with harness. Their
1450,ENDNOTES:,steeds were fair and their trappings red with gold. No need were there
1451,ENDNOTES:,to live more proudly than Siegfried and his men. Then he asked for leave
1452,ENDNOTES:,to journey to the land of Burgundy; this the king and queen sorrowfully
1453,ENDNOTES:,"vouchsafed. Lovingly he comforted them twain. ""For my sake,"" spake he,"
1454,ENDNOTES:,"""must ye not weep, nor have fear for me or for my life."""
1455,ENDNOTES:,
1456,ENDNOTES:,"The warriors, too, were sad and many a maiden wept; I ween, their hearts"
1457,ENDNOTES:,did tell them rightly that many of their kinsmen would come to death
1458,ENDNOTES:,because of this. Just cause had they for wailing; need enow they had in
1459,ENDNOTES:,sooth.
1460,ENDNOTES:,
1461,ENDNOTES:,"Upon the seventh morning, forth upon the river sand at Worms the brave"
1462,ENDNOTES:,warriors pricked. Their armor was of ruddy gold and their trappings
1463,ENDNOTES:,fashioned fair. Smoothly trotted the steeds of bold Siegfried's men.
1464,ENDNOTES:,"Their shields were new; gleaming and broad and fair their helmets, as"
1465,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, the bold, rode to court in Gunther's land. Never had such"
1466,ENDNOTES:,princely attire been seen on heroes; their sword-points hung down
1467,ENDNOTES:,to their spurs. Sharp javelins were borne by these chosen knights.
1468,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried wielded one full two spans broad, which upon its edges cut"
1469,ENDNOTES:,most dangerously. In their hands they held gold-colored bridles; their
1470,ENDNOTES:,martingales were silken: so they came into the land. Everywhere the folk
1471,ENDNOTES:,began to gape amazed and many of Gunther's men fared forth to meet them.
1472,ENDNOTES:,"High-mettled warriors, both knight and squire, betook them to the lords"
1473,ENDNOTES:,"(as was but right), and received into the land of their lords these"
1474,ENDNOTES:,guests and took from their hands the black sumpters which bore the
1475,ENDNOTES:,"shields. The steeds, too, they wished to lead away for easement. How"
1476,ENDNOTES:,"boldly then brave Siegfried spake: ""Let stand the mounts of me and of"
1477,ENDNOTES:,"my men. We will soon hence again, of this have I great desire. Whosoever"
1478,ENDNOTES:,"knoweth rightly where I can find the king, Gunther, the mighty, of"
1479,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundian land, let him not keep his peace but tell me."""
1480,ENDNOTES:,
1481,ENDNOTES:,"Then up spake one to whom it was rightly known: ""Would ye find the king,"
1482,ENDNOTES:,that can hap full well. In yon broad hall with his heroes did I but see
1483,ENDNOTES:,him. Ye must hither hie you; there ye may find with him many a lordly
1484,ENDNOTES:,"man."""
1485,ENDNOTES:,
1486,ENDNOTES:,"To the king now the word was brought, that full lusty knights were come,"
1487,ENDNOTES:,who wore white breastplates and princely garb. None knew them in the
1488,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land. Much it wondered the king whence came these lordly
1489,ENDNOTES:,"warriors in such shining array, with such good shields, both new and"
1490,ENDNOTES:,"broad. Loth was it to Gunther, that none could tell him this. Then"
1491,ENDNOTES:,Ortwin of Metz (a bold and mighty man was he) made answer to the king:
1492,ENDNOTES:,"""Since we know them not, ye should send for mine uncle Hagen, and let"
1493,ENDNOTES:,him see them. To him are known (4) all kingdoms and foreign lands. If so
1494,ENDNOTES:,"be he knoweth these lords, he will tell us straightway."""
1495,ENDNOTES:,
1496,ENDNOTES:,Then bade the king that Hagen and his men be brought. One saw him with
1497,ENDNOTES:,his warriors striding in lordly wise unto the court.
1498,ENDNOTES:,
1499,ENDNOTES:,"""What would the king of me?"" asked Hagen."
1500,ENDNOTES:,
1501,ENDNOTES:,"""There be come to my house strange warriors, whelm here none knoweth. If"
1502,ENDNOTES:,"ye have ever seen them, I pray you, Hagen, tell me now the truth."""
1503,ENDNOTES:,
1504,ENDNOTES:,"""That will I,"" spake then Hagen. He hied him to a window and over the"
1505,ENDNOTES:,guests he let his glances roam. Well liked him their trappings and their
1506,ENDNOTES:,"array, but full strange were they to him in the Burgundian land. He"
1507,ENDNOTES:,"spake: ""From wheresoever these warriors be come unto the Rhine, they may"
1508,ENDNOTES:,"well be princes or envoys of kings, for their steeds are fair and"
1509,ENDNOTES:,"their garments passing good. Whencesoever they bear these, forsooth"
1510,ENDNOTES:,"high-mettled warriors be they."""
1511,ENDNOTES:,
1512,ENDNOTES:,"""I dare well say,"" so spake Hagen, ""though I never have seen Siegfried,"
1513,ENDNOTES:,"yet can I well believe, however this may be, that he is the warrior that"
1514,ENDNOTES:,strideth yonder in such lordly wise. He bringeth new tidings hither to
1515,ENDNOTES:,"this land. By this here's hand were slain the bold Nibelungs, Schilbung"
1516,ENDNOTES:,"and Nibelung, (5) sons of a mighty king. Since then he hath wrought"
1517,ENDNOTES:,great marvels with his huge strength. Once as the hero rode alone
1518,ENDNOTES:,"without all aid, he found before a mountain, as I have in sooth been"
1519,ENDNOTES:,"told, by Nibelung's hoard full many a daring man. Strangers they were to"
1520,ENDNOTES:,"him, till he gained knowledge of them there."
1521,ENDNOTES:,
1522,ENDNOTES:,"""The hoard of Nibelung was borne entire from out a hollow hill. Now hear"
1523,ENDNOTES:,"a wondrous tale, of how the liegemen of Nibelung wished to divide it"
1524,ENDNOTES:,there. This the hero Siegfried saw and much it gan wonder him. So near
1525,ENDNOTES:,"was he now come to them, that he beheld the heroes, and the knights"
1526,ENDNOTES:,"espied him, too. One among them spake: 'Here cometh the mighty"
1527,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, the hero of Netherland.' Passing strange were the tidings"
1528,ENDNOTES:,"that, he found among the Nibelungs. Schilbung and Nibelung greeted well"
1529,ENDNOTES:,the knight; with one accord these young and noble lordings bade the
1530,ENDNOTES:,"stately man divide the hoard. Eagerly they asked it, and the lord in"
1531,ENDNOTES:,turn gan vow it to them.
1532,ENDNOTES:,
1533,ENDNOTES:,"""He beheld such store of gems, as we have heard said, that a hundred"
1534,ENDNOTES:,wains might not bear the lead; still more was there of ruddy gold from
1535,ENDNOTES:,the Nibelung land. All this the hand of the daring Siegfried should
1536,ENDNOTES:,"divide. As a guerdon they gave him the sword of Nibelung, but they were"
1537,ENDNOTES:,served full ill by the service which the good knight Siegfried should
1538,ENDNOTES:,render them. Nor could he end it for them; angry of mood (6) they grew.
1539,ENDNOTES:,"Twelve bold men of their kith were there, mighty giants these. What"
1540,ENDNOTES:,"might that avail them! Siegfried's hand slew them soon in wrath, and"
1541,ENDNOTES:,seven hundred warriors from the Nibelung land he vanquished with the
1542,ENDNOTES:,"good sword Balmung. (7) Because of the great fear that, many a young"
1543,ENDNOTES:,"warrior had of the sword and of the valiant man, they made the land and"
1544,ENDNOTES:,its castles subject to his hand. Likewise both the mighty kings he
1545,ENDNOTES:,"slew, but soon he himself was sorely pressed by Alberich. (8) The"
1546,ENDNOTES:,"latter weened to venge straightway his masters, till he then discovered"
1547,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried's mighty strength; for no match for him was the sturdy dwarf.
1548,ENDNOTES:,"Like wild lions they ran to the hill, where from Alberich he won the"
1549,ENDNOTES:,"Cloak of Darkness. (9) Thus did Siegfried, the terrible, become master"
1550,ENDNOTES:,"of the hoard; those who had dared the combat, all lay there slain. Soon"
1551,ENDNOTES:,bade he cart and bear the treasure to the place from whence the men of
1552,ENDNOTES:,"Nibelung had borne it forth. He made Alberich, the strong, warden of the"
1553,ENDNOTES:,hoard and bade him swear an oath to serve him as his knave; and fit he
1554,ENDNOTES:,"was for work of every sort."""

1662,ENDNOTES:,
1663,ENDNOTES:,At this Lord Siegfried grew of somewhat gentler mood. Then they bade

1665,ENDNOTES:,men might find were sought for Siegfried's squires; great easement they
1666,ENDNOTES:,gave them. Thereafter they gladly saw the guest in Burgundy. Many a day
1667,ENDNOTES:,"they offered him great worship, a thousand fold more than I can tell"

1671,ENDNOTES:,"Whenever the lordings and their liegemen did play at knightly games,"

1675,ENDNOTES:,"made merry with the ladies, there were they glad to see the hero of"
1676,ENDNOTES:,"Netherland, for upon high love his heart was bent. He was aye ready for"

1678,ENDNOTES:,"had never seen. She too, who in secret spake full well of him, cherished"
1679,ENDNOTES:,"him alone. Whenever the pages, squires, and knights would play their"
1680,ENDNOTES:,"games within the court, Kriemhild, the noble queen, watched them from"
1681,ENDNOTES:,"the windows, for no other pastime she needed on such days. Had he known"
1682,ENDNOTES:,"that she gazed on him thus, whom he bare within his heart, then had he"
1683,ENDNOTES:,"had pastime enough, I trow, for well I wot that no greater joy in all"

1685,ENDNOTES:,
1686,ENDNOTES:,"Whenever he stood by the heroes in the court, as men still are wont to"
1687,ENDNOTES:,"do, for pastime's sake, so winsome was the posture of Siegelind's son,"

1689,ENDNOTES:,"many a day: ""How shall that hap, that I with mine own eyes may see the"

1696,ENDNOTES:,"with the lordings, of a truth, full a year in Gunther's land, and in all"

1879,ENDNOTES:,"all the countryside, so that the two kings did learn of it in dire"
1880,ENDNOTES:,distress. Then came they to the border; the warriors marched along.
1881,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, the strong, gan ask: ""Who shall now guard here the troop?"""
1882,ENDNOTES:,Forsooth never did men ride more scathfully to the Saxons. They spake:
1883,ENDNOTES:,"""Let the valiant Dankwart guard the young upon the way, he is a doughty"
1884,ENDNOTES:,knight. Thus shall we lose the less through Liudeger's men. Let him and
1885,ENDNOTES:,"Ortwin guard the rear."""
1886,ENDNOTES:,
1887,ENDNOTES:,"""Then I myself will ride,"" spake Siegfried, the knight, ""and play the"
1888,ENDNOTES:,"outlook toward the foe, until I discover aright where these warriors"
1889,ENDNOTES:,"be."" Quickly the son of fair Siegelind donned his harness. The troop"
1890,ENDNOTES:,"he gave in charge to Hagen, when he would depart, and to Gernot, the"
1891,ENDNOTES:,valiant man. Thus he rode hence into the Saxon land alone and many a
1892,ENDNOTES:,helmet band he cut to pieces on that day. Soon he spied the mighty host
1893,ENDNOTES:,that lay encamped upon the plain and far outweighed the forces of his
1894,ENDNOTES:,men. Forty thousand or better still there were. Full blithely Siegfried
1895,ENDNOTES:,saw this in lofty mood. Meantime a warrior full well arrayed had mounted
1896,ENDNOTES:,"to the outlook 'gainst the foe. Him Sir Siegfried spied, and the bold"
1897,ENDNOTES:,"man saw him, too. Each began to watch the other in hostile wise. Who it"
1898,ENDNOTES:,"was, who stood on guard, I'll tell you now; a gleaming shield of gold"
1899,ENDNOTES:,"lay by his hand. It was the good King Liudegast, who was guarding here"
1900,ENDNOTES:,his band. The noble stranger pricked along in lordly wise.
1901,ENDNOTES:,
1902,ENDNOTES:,Now had Sir Liudegast espied him with hostile eye. Into the flanks of
1903,ENDNOTES:,their horses they plunged the spurs; with all their might they couched
1904,ENDNOTES:,the spears against the shields. At this great fear befell the mighty
1905,ENDNOTES:,king. After the thrust the horses carried past each other the royal
1906,ENDNOTES:,"knights, as though borne upon the wind. With the bridles they wheeled"
1907,ENDNOTES:,in knightly wise and the two fierce champions encountered with their
1908,ENDNOTES:,"swords. Then smote Sir Siegfried, so that the whole field did ring."
1909,ENDNOTES:,"Through the hero's hand from out the helmets, as from firebrands, flew"
1910,ENDNOTES:,"the bright red sparks. Each in the other found his match. Sir Liudegast,"
1911,ENDNOTES:,"too, struck many a savage blow; the might of each broke full upon the"
1912,ENDNOTES:,"shields. Thirty of Liudegast's men stood there on guard, but ere they"
1913,ENDNOTES:,"could come to his aid, Siegfried had won the fight, with three groat"
1914,ENDNOTES:,"wounds which he dealt the king through his gleaming breastplate, the"
1915,ENDNOTES:,which was passing good. The blood from the wounds gushed forth along
1916,ENDNOTES:,"the edges of the sword, whereat King Liudegast stood in sorry mood. He"
1917,ENDNOTES:,begged for life and made offrance of his lands and said that his name
1918,ENDNOTES:,"was Liudegast. Then came his warrior's, who had witnessed what there had"
1919,ENDNOTES:,"happed upon the lookout. As Siegfried would lead his captive thence, he"
1920,ENDNOTES:,was set upon by thirty of these men. With mighty blows the hero's hand
1921,ENDNOTES:,guarded his noble prize. The stately knight then wrought worse scathe.
1922,ENDNOTES:,"In self-defense he did thirty unto death; only one he left alive,"
1923,ENDNOTES:,who rode full fast to tell the tale of what here had chanced. By his
1924,ENDNOTES:,reddened helmet one might see the truth. It sorely grieved the men of
1925,ENDNOTES:,"Denmark, when the tale was told them that their king was taken captive."
1926,ENDNOTES:,"Men told it to his brother, who at the news began to rage with monstrous"
1927,ENDNOTES:,"wrath, for great woe it brought him."
1928,ENDNOTES:,
1929,ENDNOTES:,"Liudegast, the warrior, then was led away by Siegfried's might to"
1930,ENDNOTES:,Gunther's men and given to Hagen in charge. When that they heard it was
1931,ENDNOTES:,"the king, full moderate was their dole. The Burgundians now were bidden"
1932,ENDNOTES:,"raise their banner. ""Up, men,"" cried Siegfried, ""here shall more be"
1933,ENDNOTES:,"done, ere the day end, and I lose not my life. Full many a stately dame"
1934,ENDNOTES:,"in Saxon land shall rue this fight. Ye heroes from the Rhine, give heed"
1935,ENDNOTES:,"to me, for I can guide you well to Liudeger's band. So shall ye see"
1936,ENDNOTES:,"helmets carved by the hands of goodly knights; ere we turn again, they"
1937,ENDNOTES:,"shall become acquaint with fear."""
1938,ENDNOTES:,
1939,ENDNOTES:,"To their horses Gernot and all his men now hasted, and soon the stalwart"
1940,ENDNOTES:,"minstrel, Sir Folker, grasped the battle-flag and rode before the band."
1941,ENDNOTES:,Then were all the comrades arrayed in lordly wise for strife; nor
1942,ENDNOTES:,"had they more than a thousand men, and thereto Siegfried's twelve"
1943,ENDNOTES:,"men-at-arms. Now from the road gan rise the dust, as across the land"
1944,ENDNOTES:,they rode; many a lordly shield was seen to gleam from out their midst.
1945,ENDNOTES:,"There, too, were come the Saxons with their troops and well-sharpened"
1946,ENDNOTES:,"swords, as I since have heard. Sore cut these weapons in the heroes'"
1947,ENDNOTES:,"hands, for they would fain guard both their castles and their land"
1948,ENDNOTES:,against the strangers. The lordings' marshals led on the troop.
1949,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, too, was come with his men-at-arms, whom he had brought from"
1950,ENDNOTES:,Netherland. In the storm of battle many a hand this day grew red with
1951,ENDNOTES:,"blood. Sindolt and Hunolt and Gernot, too, slew many a knight in the"
1952,ENDNOTES:,"strife, ere these rightly knew the boldness of their foes. This many a"
1953,ENDNOTES:,"stately dame must needs bewail. Folker and Hagen and Ortwin, too,"
1954,ENDNOTES:,"dimmed in the battle the gleam of many a helm with flowing blood, these"
1955,ENDNOTES:,"storm-bold men. By Dankwart, too, great deeds were done."
1956,ENDNOTES:,
1957,ENDNOTES:,The men of Denmark proved well their hands; one heard many a shield
1958,ENDNOTES:,"resounding from the hurtling and from the sharp swords as well, many of"
1959,ENDNOTES:,"which were wielded there. The battle-bold Saxons did scathe enow, but"
1960,ENDNOTES:,"when the men of Burgundy pressed to the fight, by them was really a wide"
1961,ENDNOTES:,wound carved. Then down across the saddles the blood was seen to flow.
1962,ENDNOTES:,"Thus they fought for honors, these knights both bold and good. Loud rang"
1963,ENDNOTES:,"the sharp weapons in the heroes' hands, as those of Netherland followed"
1964,ENDNOTES:,their lording through the sturdy host. Valiantly they forced their way
1965,ENDNOTES:,"in Siegfried's wake, but not a knight from the Rhine was seen to follow."
1966,ENDNOTES:,"Through the shining helmets one could see flow the bloody stream, drawn"
1967,ENDNOTES:,"forth by Siegfried's hand, till at last he found Liudeger before his"
1968,ENDNOTES:,men-at-arms. Thrice had he pierced the host from end to end. Now was
1969,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen come, who helped him achieve in the battle all his mind. Before"
1970,ENDNOTES:,them many a good knight must needs die this day.
1971,ENDNOTES:,
1972,ENDNOTES:,When the mighty Liudeger espied Siegfried and saw that he bore high in
1973,ENDNOTES:,"hand the good sword Balmung and did slay so many a man, then waxed the"
1974,ENDNOTES:,lording wroth and fierce enow. A mighty surging and a mighty clang of
1975,ENDNOTES:,"swords arose, as their comrades pressed against each other. The two"
1976,ENDNOTES:,champions tried their prowess all the more. The troops began to yield;
1977,ENDNOTES:,fierce grew the hate. To the ruler of the Saxons the tale was told that
1978,ENDNOTES:,his brother had been captured; great dole this gave him. Well he knew it
1979,ENDNOTES:,"was the son of Siegelind who had done the deed. Men blamed Sir Gernot,"
1980,ENDNOTES:,but later he learned the truth.
1981,ENDNOTES:,
1982,ENDNOTES:,So mighty were the blows of Liudeger that Siegfried's charger reeled
1983,ENDNOTES:,"beneath the saddle. When the steed recovered, bold Siegfried took on a"
1984,ENDNOTES:,"frightful usance in the fray. In this Hagen helped him well, likewise"
1985,ENDNOTES:,"Gernot, Dankwart, and Folker, too. Through them lay many dead. Likewise"
1986,ENDNOTES:,"Sindolt and Hunolt and Ortwin, the knight, laid many low in strife; side"
1987,ENDNOTES:,by side in the fray the noble princes stood. One saw above the helmets
1988,ENDNOTES:,"many a spear, thrown by here's hand, hurtling through the gleaming"
1989,ENDNOTES:,shields. Blood-red was colored many a lordly buckler; many a man in the
1990,ENDNOTES:,"fierce conflict was unhorsed. At each other ran Siegfried, the brave,"
1991,ENDNOTES:,and Liudeger; shafts were seen to fly and many a keen-edged spear. Then
1992,ENDNOTES:,"off flew the shield-plates, struck by Siegfried's hand; the hero of"
1993,ENDNOTES:,"Netherland thought to win the battle from the valiant Saxons, wondrous"
1994,ENDNOTES:,many of whom one saw. Ho! How many shining armor-rings the daring
1995,ENDNOTES:,Dankwart broke!
1996,ENDNOTES:,
1997,ENDNOTES:,Then Sir Liudeger espied a crown painted on the shield in Siegfried's
1998,ENDNOTES:,"hand. Well he knew that it was Siegfried, the mighty man. To his friends"
1999,ENDNOTES:,"the hero loudly called: ""Desist ye from the strife, my men, here I have"
2000,ENDNOTES:,"seen the son of Siegmund, Siegfried, the strong, and recognized him"
2001,ENDNOTES:,"well. The foul fiend himself hath sent him hither to the Saxon land."""
2002,ENDNOTES:,"The banners bade he lower in the fight. Peace he craved, and this was"
2003,ENDNOTES:,"later granted him, but he must needs go as hostage to Gunther's land."
2004,ENDNOTES:,This was wrung from him by valiant Siegfried's hand. With one accord
2005,ENDNOTES:,they then gave over the strife and laid aside the many riddled helmets
2006,ENDNOTES:,"and the broad, battered bucklers. Whatever of these was found, bore the"
2007,ENDNOTES:,"hue of blood from the Burgundians' hand. They captured whom they would,"
2008,ENDNOTES:,"for this lay in their power. Gernot and Hagen, the full bold warriors,"
2009,ENDNOTES:,bade bear away the wounded; five hundred stately men they led forth
2010,ENDNOTES:,"captive to the Rhine. The worsted knights rode back to Denmark, nor had"
2011,ENDNOTES:,"the Saxons fought so well that one could give them aught of praise, and"
2012,ENDNOTES:,"this the heroes rued full sore. The fallen, too, were greatly mourned by"
2013,ENDNOTES:,friends.
2014,ENDNOTES:,
2015,ENDNOTES:,"Then they bade place the weapons on sumpters for the Rhine. Siegfried,"
2016,ENDNOTES:,"the warrior, and his heroes had wrought full well, as Gunther's men must"
2017,ENDNOTES:,needs confess. Sir Gernot now sent messengers homeward to Worms in his
2018,ENDNOTES:,"native land, and bade tell his kin what great success had happed to him"
2019,ENDNOTES:,"and to his men, and how these daring knights had striven well for"
2020,ENDNOTES:,honor. The squirelings ran and told the tale. Then those who afore had
2021,ENDNOTES:,"sorrowed, were blithe for joy at the pleasing tidings that were come."
2022,ENDNOTES:,"Much questioning was heard from noble dames, how it had fared with"
2023,ENDNOTES:,the liegemen of the mighty king. One of the messengers they bade go to
2024,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild; this happed full secretly (openly she durst not), for she,"
2025,ENDNOTES:,"too, had amongst them her own true love. When she saw the messenger"
2026,ENDNOTES:,"coming to her bower, fair Kriemhild spake in kindly wise: ""Now tell me"
2027,ENDNOTES:,"glad news, I pray. And thou dost so without deceit, I will give thee of"
2028,ENDNOTES:,my gold and will ever be thy friend. How fared forth from the battle my
2029,ENDNOTES:,brother Gernot and others of my kin? Are many of them dead perchance? Or
2030,ENDNOTES:,"who wrought there the best? This thou must tell me."""
2031,ENDNOTES:,
2032,ENDNOTES:,"Quickly then the envoy spake: ""Ne'er a coward did we have, but, to tell"
2033,ENDNOTES:,"the truth, O noble queen, none rode so well to the strife and fray,"
2034,ENDNOTES:,as did the noble stranger from Netherland. Mickle wonders the hand of
2035,ENDNOTES:,"valiant Siegfried wrought. Whate'er the knights have done in strife,"
2036,ENDNOTES:,"Dankwart and Hagen and other men of the king, however much they strove"
2037,ENDNOTES:,"for honor, 'tis but as the wind compared with Siegfried, the son of"
2038,ENDNOTES:,"Siegmund, the king. They slew full many a hero in the fray, but none"
2039,ENDNOTES:,"might tell you of the wonders which Siegfried wrought, whenever he rode"
2040,ENDNOTES:,into the fight. Great woe he did the ladies through their kin; upon the
2041,ENDNOTES:,field the love of many a dame lay dead. His blows were heard to ring so
2042,ENDNOTES:,"loud upon the helmets, that from the wounds they drew forth the blood"
2043,ENDNOTES:,in streams. In every knightly art he is a worthy knight and a brave.
2044,ENDNOTES:,Whatever Ortwin of Metz achieved (and he whom he could reach with his
2045,ENDNOTES:,"good sword, fell sorely wounded, but mostly dead), yet your brother"
2046,ENDNOTES:,wrought the direst woe that could ever chance in battle. One must say of
2047,ENDNOTES:,"the chosen knights in truth, that these proud Burgundians acquitted"
2048,ENDNOTES:,them so well that they can well preserve their honor from every taint
2049,ENDNOTES:,"of shame. Through their hands we saw many a saddle bare, while the field"
2050,ENDNOTES:,resounded with the flashing swords. So well rode the warriors from
2051,ENDNOTES:,"the Rhine, that it were better for their foes had it been avoided. The"
2052,ENDNOTES:,"valiant men of Troneg, also, wrought dire woe, when in great numbers the"
2053,ENDNOTES:,armies met. Bold Hagen's hand did many a one to death; of this full many
2054,ENDNOTES:,"stories might be told here in the Burgundian land. Sindolt and Hunolt,"
2055,ENDNOTES:,"Gernot's men, Rumolt the brave, have done such deeds that it may well"
2056,ENDNOTES:,ever rue Liudeger that he made war upon thy kinsmen by the Rhine. The
2057,ENDNOTES:,"very best fight that happed from first to last, that one has ever seen,"
2058,ENDNOTES:,was made full lustily by Siegfried's hand. Rich hostages he bringeth to
2059,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther's land. He won them by his prowess, this stately man. Of this"
2060,ENDNOTES:,King Liudegast must bear the loss and eke his brother Liudeger of Saxon
2061,ENDNOTES:,"land. Now listen to my tale, most noble queen: by the hand of Siegfried"
2062,ENDNOTES:,the twain were caught. Never have men brought so many hostages to this
2063,ENDNOTES:,"land, as now are coming to the Rhine through him. Men are bringing"
2064,ENDNOTES:,to our land five hundred or more unharmed captives; and of the deadly
2065,ENDNOTES:,"wounded, my lady, know, not less than eighty blood-red biers. These men"
2066,ENDNOTES:,were mostly wounded by bold Siegfried's hand. Those who in haughty
2067,ENDNOTES:,"pride sent a challenge to the Rhine, must now needs be the captives of"
2068,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther, the king, and men are bringing them with joy unto this land."""
2069,ENDNOTES:,
2070,ENDNOTES:,Still higher rose Kriemhild's color when she heard this tale. Her fair
2071,ENDNOTES:,"face blushed a rosy red, that Siegfried, the youth, the stately knight,"
2072,ENDNOTES:,had fared forth so joyfully from the dangerous strife. These tidings
2073,ENDNOTES:,"could not have pleased her better. For her kinsmen, too, she rejoiced in"
2074,ENDNOTES:,"duty bound. Then spake the lovely maid: ""A fair tale thou hast told me;"
2075,ENDNOTES:,therefore shalt thou have as guerdon rich attire. Likewise I'll have
2076,ENDNOTES:,"thee brought ten marks of gold."" (5) Small wonder that such tales are"
2077,ENDNOTES:,gladly told to noble dames.
2078,ENDNOTES:,
2079,ENDNOTES:,"They gave him then his guerdon, the garments and the gold. Then many a"
2080,ENDNOTES:,"fair maid hied her to the casement and gazed upon the street, where many"
2081,ENDNOTES:,high-mettled warriors were seen riding into the Burgundian land. There
2082,ENDNOTES:,"came the champions, the wounded and the sound. Without shame they heard"
2083,ENDNOTES:,the greetings of their friends. Merrily the host rode forth to meet his
2084,ENDNOTES:,"guests, for his great sorrow had been turned to joy. Well greeted he"
2085,ENDNOTES:,"his vassals and the strangers, too; for it was only meet that the mighty"
2086,ENDNOTES:,"king in courtly wise should thank those who were come back to him,"
2087,ENDNOTES:,because in the storm of battle they had won the fight with honor.
2088,ENDNOTES:,Gunther bade his kinsmen tell who had been slain upon the march; but
2089,ENDNOTES:,"sixty had been lost, whom one must mourn, as is the wont with heroes."
2090,ENDNOTES:,Many a riven shield and battered helm the unharmed warriors brought to
2091,ENDNOTES:,Gunther's land. The men alighted from their steeds before the palace
2092,ENDNOTES:,of the king. Loud was heard the joyous sound of the merry welcome;
2093,ENDNOTES:,then order was given to lodge the warriors in the town. The king bade
2094,ENDNOTES:,"minister well unto his guests, attend the wounded and give them good"
2095,ENDNOTES:,easement. His courtesie was cleverly seen upon his foes. He spake to
2096,ENDNOTES:,"Liudegast: ""Now be ye welcome. Much damage have I ta'en because of you;"
2097,ENDNOTES:,"for this I shall now be repaid, if fortune favor. God reward my kinsmen,"
2098,ENDNOTES:,"for they have given me joy."""
2099,ENDNOTES:,
2100,ENDNOTES:,"""Well may ye thank them,"" answered Liudeger; ""such noble hostages hath"
2101,ENDNOTES:,king never gained afore. For fair treatment we offer great store of
2102,ENDNOTES:,"wealth, that ye may act with mercy towards your foes."""
2103,ENDNOTES:,
2104,ENDNOTES:,"""I will let you both go free,"" spake Gunther, ""but I must have surety"
2105,ENDNOTES:,"that my foes remain here with me, that they do not leave the land"
2106,ENDNOTES:,"against my will."" To that Liudeger pledged his hand."
2107,ENDNOTES:,
2108,ENDNOTES:,Men brought them to their lodgings and gave them easement. The wounded
2109,ENDNOTES:,"were bedded well, and for the sound were poured out good mead and wine."
2110,ENDNOTES:,Never could the comrades have been more merry. Their battered shields
2111,ENDNOTES:,"were borne away for keeping, and enow there was of bloody saddles which"
2112,ENDNOTES:,"one bade hide away, that the ladies might not weep. Many a good knight"
2113,ENDNOTES:,returned aweary from the fray. The king did make his guests great cheer.
2114,ENDNOTES:,His lands were full of strangers and of home-folk. He bade ease the
2115,ENDNOTES:,sorely wounded in kindly wise; their haughty pride was now laid low. Men
2116,ENDNOTES:,"offered to the leeches rich rewards, silver without weight and thereto"
2117,ENDNOTES:,"shining gold, if they would heal the heroes from the stress of war. To"
2118,ENDNOTES:,his guests the king likewise gave great gifts. Those that were minded to
2119,ENDNOTES:,"set out for home, were asked to stay, as one doth to friends. The king"
2120,ENDNOTES:,"bethought him how he might requite his men, for they had brought to pass"
2121,ENDNOTES:,his wish for fame and honor.
2122,ENDNOTES:,
2123,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Lord Gernot: ""Let them ride away, but be it made known to"
2124,ENDNOTES:,them that in six weeks they must come again for a mighty feast. By then
2125,ENDNOTES:,"will many a one be healed who now lieth sorely wounded."""
2126,ENDNOTES:,
2127,ENDNOTES:,"Then Siegfried of Netherland also asked for leave, but when King Gunther"
2128,ENDNOTES:,"learned his wish, lovingly he bade him stay erstwhile. Were it not for"
2129,ENDNOTES:,"the king's sister, this were never done. He was too rich to take reward,"
2130,ENDNOTES:,"though he well deserved it and the king liked him well, as also did the"
2131,ENDNOTES:,"kinsmen, who had seen what happed in battle through his strength. For"
2132,ENDNOTES:,"the sake of one fair lady he thought to stay, if perchance he might espy"
2133,ENDNOTES:,"her. Later it was done, and according to his wish he met the maid. He"
2134,ENDNOTES:,rode thereafter joyfully to Siegmund's land.
2135,ENDNOTES:,
2136,ENDNOTES:,"At all times the host bade practice knighthood, and many a youthful"
2137,ENDNOTES:,knight did this right gladly. Meanwhile he ordered seats prepared upon
2138,ENDNOTES:,the sand before the town of Worms for those who were to visit him in the
2139,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundian land. At the time when they should come, fair Kriemhild heard"
2140,ENDNOTES:,it said that the king would hold a feasting for the sake of his dear
2141,ENDNOTES:,friends. Then comely women hasted apace with robes and headgear which
2142,ENDNOTES:,they were to don. The noble Uta heard tales told of the proud warriors
2143,ENDNOTES:,who were to come. Then many rich dresses were taken from the press. To
2144,ENDNOTES:,"please her children she bade make garments ready, that many ladies and"
2145,ENDNOTES:,many maids might therewith be decked and many youthful knights of the
2146,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land. Also for many of the strangers she bade fashion lordly
2147,ENDNOTES:,robes.

2154,ENDNOTES:,period elapsing between Siegfried's marriage and the journey
2155,ENDNOTES:,to Brunhild's land.  (In our poem it is placed before the
2156,ENDNOTES:,marriage.)  It reflects the ancient feuds between the Franks
2157,ENDNOTES:,on the one hand and the Saxons and Danes on the other.
2158,ENDNOTES:,"Originally Siegfried probably did not take part in it, but"
2159,ENDNOTES:,was later introduced and made the leader of the expedition
2160,ENDNOTES:,"in place of the king, in accordance with the tendency to"

2192,ENDNOTES:,"men received the friends and strangers. In truth, they gave the knights"
2193,ENDNOTES:,right courtly greetings. These brought into the land many a saddle
2194,ENDNOTES:,"of golden red, dainty shields and lordly armor to the feasting on the"
2195,ENDNOTES:,Rhine. Many a wounded man was seen full merry since. Even those who lay
2196,ENDNOTES:,"abed in stress of wounds, must needs forget the bitterness of death."
2197,ENDNOTES:,Men ceased to mourn for the weak and sick and joyed in prospect of the
2198,ENDNOTES:,"festal day, and how well they would fare at the feasting of the king."
2199,ENDNOTES:,Pleasure without stint and overabundance of joy pervaded all the folk
2200,ENDNOTES:,which there were seen. Therefore great rejoicing arose throughout the
2201,ENDNOTES:,whole of Gunther's land.
2202,ENDNOTES:,
2203,ENDNOTES:,"Upon a Whitsun morning five thousand or more brave men, clad in glad"
2204,ENDNOTES:,"attire, were seen going forth to the high festal tide. On all sides they"
2205,ENDNOTES:,"vied with each other in knightly sports. The host marked well, what he"
2206,ENDNOTES:,"already wet, how from his very heart the hero of Netherland did love his"
2207,ENDNOTES:,"sister, albeit he had never seen her, whose comeliness men praised above"
2208,ENDNOTES:,"all maids. Then spake the knight Ortwin to the king: ""Would ye have full"
2209,ENDNOTES:,"honor at your feast, so should ye let be seen the charming maids, who"
2210,ENDNOTES:,"live in such high honors here in Burgundy. What were the joy of man,"
2211,ENDNOTES:,"what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?"
2212,ENDNOTES:,"Pray let your sister go forth before the guests."" To the joy of many a"
2213,ENDNOTES:,hero was this counsel given.
2214,ENDNOTES:,
2215,ENDNOTES:,"""This will I gladly do,"" spake then the king, and all who heard it were"
2216,ENDNOTES:,merry at the thought. Then bade he say to the Lady Uta and her comely
2217,ENDNOTES:,"daughter, that with their maidens they should come to court. From the"
2218,ENDNOTES:,presses they took fair raiment and whatso of rich attire was laid away.
2219,ENDNOTES:,"Of rings and ribbons, too, enow they had. Thus each stately maiden"
2220,ENDNOTES:,decked herself with zeal. Full many a youthful knight upon that day was
2221,ENDNOTES:,"of the mind that he was so fair to look upon for ladies, that he would"
2222,ENDNOTES:,not exchange this chance for the lands of any mighty king. Gladly they
2223,ENDNOTES:,gazed on those whom till now they had not known. Then bade the mighty
2224,ENDNOTES:,"king full a hundred of his men, who were his kin and hers, escort"
2225,ENDNOTES:,his sister and serve her thus. These were the court retainers of the
2226,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land and carried swords in hand. Soon one saw the noble Uta
2227,ENDNOTES:,coming with her child. Full hundred or more fair ladies had she taken
2228,ENDNOTES:,"for her train, who wore rich robes. Likewise there followed her daughter"
2229,ENDNOTES:,"many a stately maid. When from out a bower men saw them come, there rose"
2230,ENDNOTES:,"a mighty press of knights who had the hope, if that might be, to gaze"
2231,ENDNOTES:,"with joy upon the noble maid. Now came she forth, the lovely fair, as"
2232,ENDNOTES:,doth the red of dawn from out the lowering clouds. He then was reft
2233,ENDNOTES:,"of many woes who bore her in his heart so long a time, when he saw the"
2234,ENDNOTES:,lovely maid stand forth so glorious. How shone full many a precious
2235,ENDNOTES:,stone upon her robes! In lovely wise her rose-red hue appeared. Whatever
2236,ENDNOTES:,"one might wish, he could not but confess that never in the world had"
2237,ENDNOTES:,"he beheld a fairer maid. As the radiant moon, whose sheen is thrown so"
2238,ENDNOTES:,"brightly on the clouds, doth stand before the stars, so stood she now"
2239,ENDNOTES:,before full many a stately dame. Therefore higher rose the spirits of
2240,ENDNOTES:,"the comely knights. Richly appareled chamberlains marched on in front,"
2241,ENDNOTES:,while the high-mettled warriors forsooth must press where they might
2242,ENDNOTES:,see the lovely maid. At this Lord Siegfried felt both joy and dole. To
2243,ENDNOTES:,"himself he thought: ""How could that chance, that I should love thee?"
2244,ENDNOTES:,"That is a foolish dream. But if I now must lose thee, then were I better"
2245,ENDNOTES:,"dead."" At thought of this his color came and went. There stood the son"
2246,ENDNOTES:,"of Siegmund in such dainty grace, as he were limned on parchment by"
2247,ENDNOTES:,skillful master's art. Indeed 'twas said of him that never had so fair a
2248,ENDNOTES:,knight been seen. The escort of the ladies now bade everywhere give
2249,ENDNOTES:,way and many a man obeyed. These high-born hearts rejoiced full many a
2250,ENDNOTES:,"wight, as thus so many a noble dame appeared in courtly bearing."
2251,ENDNOTES:,
2252,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Lord Gernot of Burgundy: ""Dear brother Gunther, him who"
2253,ENDNOTES:,"offered service in such kindly wise, ye should in like manner requite"
2254,ENDNOTES:,before these knights; nor shall I ever rue this counsel. Bid Siegfried
2255,ENDNOTES:,"now approach my sister, that the maid may greet him; this will ever be"
2256,ENDNOTES:,"our gain. She who never greeted warrior shall greet him fair, that by"
2257,ENDNOTES:,"this means we now may win the stately knight."""
2258,ENDNOTES:,
2259,ENDNOTES:,Then went the kinsmen of the host to fetch the hero. To the champion
2260,ENDNOTES:,"from Netherland they spake: ""You hath the king permitted to go to court;"
2261,ENDNOTES:,"his sister is to greet you. This hath he decreed to do you honor."""
2262,ENDNOTES:,
2263,ENDNOTES:,"At this the lord grew blithe of mood, for in his heart he bare joy"
2264,ENDNOTES:,"without alloy, that he thus should see fair Uta's child. With lovely"
2265,ENDNOTES:,"grace she greeted Siegfried then, but when she saw the haughty knight"
2266,ENDNOTES:,"stand thus before her, her cheeks flamed bright. ""Be welcome, Sir"
2267,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, most good and noble knight,"" the fair maid spake, and at this"
2268,ENDNOTES:,greeting his spirits mounted high. Courteously he made obeisance; she
2269,ENDNOTES:,took him by the hand. How gallantly he walked by the lady's side! Upon
2270,ENDNOTES:,each other this lord and lady gazed with kindling eyes. Full secretly
2271,ENDNOTES:,this happed. Was perchance a white hand there fervently pressed by
2272,ENDNOTES:,heart-felt love? That know I not; yet I cannot believe that this was
2273,ENDNOTES:,"left undone, for soon had she betrayed to him her love. Nevermore in"
2274,ENDNOTES:,summertide nor in the days of May bare he within his heart such lofty
2275,ENDNOTES:,"joy as now he gained, when hand in hand he walked with her whom he fain"
2276,ENDNOTES:,would call his love.
2277,ENDNOTES:,
2278,ENDNOTES:,"Then thought full many a knight: ""Had that but happed to me, to walk"
2279,ENDNOTES:,"thus with her hand in hand, as now I see him do, or to lie beside her,"
2280,ENDNOTES:,"I'd bear it willingly."""
2281,ENDNOTES:,
2282,ENDNOTES:,Never has warrior better served to gain a queen. From whatever land the
2283,ENDNOTES:,"guests were come, all gazed alike upon this pair alone. She then was"
2284,ENDNOTES:,"bidden kiss the stately man, to whom no such delight had ever happened"
2285,ENDNOTES:,in this world.
2286,ENDNOTES:,
2287,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the king of Denmark: ""Because of this high greeting many a"
2288,ENDNOTES:,"warrior lieth wounded (this wot I well), through Siegfried's hand. God"
2289,ENDNOTES:,"grant that he may never come again to my kingly lands."""
2290,ENDNOTES:,
2291,ENDNOTES:,"On all sides they bade make way for Kriemhild, as thus to church one saw"
2292,ENDNOTES:,her go with many a valiant knight in courtly wise. Then soon the stately
2293,ENDNOTES:,"knight was parted from her side. Thus went she to the minster, followed"
2294,ENDNOTES:,by many a dame. So full of graces was this queenly maid that many a
2295,ENDNOTES:,daring wish must needs be lost. Born she was to be the eyes' delight
2296,ENDNOTES:,of many a knight. Siegfried scarce could wait till mass was sung. Well
2297,ENDNOTES:,"might he think his fortune that she did favor him, whom thus he bare in"
2298,ENDNOTES:,heart. Cause enow he had to love the fair.
2299,ENDNOTES:,
2300,ENDNOTES:,"When she came forth from out the minster, they begged the gallant knight"
2301,ENDNOTES:,"again to bear her company, as he had done afore. Then first the lovely"
2302,ENDNOTES:,maid began to thank him that he had fought so gloriously before so many
2303,ENDNOTES:,"knights. ""Now God requite you, Sir Siegfried,"" spake the comely maid,"
2304,ENDNOTES:,"""that ye have brought to pass with your service, that the warriors do"
2305,ENDNOTES:,"love you with such fealty as I hear them say."""
2306,ENDNOTES:,
2307,ENDNOTES:,"Then upon Dame Kriemhild he began to gaze in loving wise. ""I will serve"
2308,ENDNOTES:,"them ever,"" spake then the knight, ""and while life shall last, never"
2309,ENDNOTES:,"will I lay my head to rest till I have done their will; and this I do,"
2310,ENDNOTES:,"my Lady Kriemhild, to win your love."""
2311,ENDNOTES:,
2312,ENDNOTES:,"A twelfth-night long, on each and every day, one saw the winsome maid"
2313,ENDNOTES:,"beside the knight, when she should go to court to meet her kin. This"
2314,ENDNOTES:,service was done from sheer delight. A great rout of joy and pleasure
2315,ENDNOTES:,"was daily seen in front of Gunther's hall, without and eke within, from"
2316,ENDNOTES:,many a daring man. Ortwin and Hagen began to do great marvels. Whatever
2317,ENDNOTES:,"any wished to play, these lusty knights were fully ready; thus they"
2318,ENDNOTES:,became well known to all the guests and so the whole of Gunther's land
2319,ENDNOTES:,was decked with honor. Those who had lain wounded were now seen coming
2320,ENDNOTES:,"forth; they, too, would fain have pastime with the troop and guard"
2321,ENDNOTES:,themselves with bucklers and hurl the shaft. Enow there were to help
2322,ENDNOTES:,"them, for there was great store of men."
2323,ENDNOTES:,
2324,ENDNOTES:,At the feasting the host bade purvey them with the best of cheer. He
2325,ENDNOTES:,kept him free from every form of blame that might befall a king; men
2326,ENDNOTES:,"saw him move in friendly wise among his guests. He spake: ""Ye worthy"
2327,ENDNOTES:,"knights, ere ye go hence, pray take my gifts. I am minded to deserve it"
2328,ENDNOTES:,"of you ever. Do not disdain my goods, the which I'll share with you, as"
2329,ENDNOTES:,"I have great desire."""
2330,ENDNOTES:,
2331,ENDNOTES:,"Then up spake they of Denmark: ""Ere we ride homeward to our land, we"
2332,ENDNOTES:,"crave a lasting peace; we knights have need thereof, for many a one of"
2333,ENDNOTES:,"our kinsmen lieth dead at the hands of your men-at-arms."""
2334,ENDNOTES:,
2335,ENDNOTES:,"Liudegast, the Saxon chief, was now cured of his wounds and had"
2336,ENDNOTES:,"recovered from the fray, though many dead they left within this land."
2337,ENDNOTES:,Then King Gunther went to find Sir Siegfried; to the knight he spake:
2338,ENDNOTES:,"""Now tell me what to do. Our foes would fain ride early and beg for"
2339,ENDNOTES:,"lasting peace of me and of my men. Advise me now, Knight Siegfried, what"
2340,ENDNOTES:,thinketh thee good to do? What the lordings offer me will I tell thee;
2341,ENDNOTES:,"what of gold five hundred steeds can bear, that would they gladly give"
2342,ENDNOTES:,"me, and I set them free again."""
2343,ENDNOTES:,
2344,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the mighty Siegfried: ""That were done but ill. Let them ride"
2345,ENDNOTES:,"hence unhindered, but make each of the lordings give surety with his"
2346,ENDNOTES:,"hand, that their noble knights henceforth forbear all hostile riding"
2347,ENDNOTES:,"hither to your land."""
2348,ENDNOTES:,
2349,ENDNOTES:,"""This counsel will I follow."" Herewith they parted, and to the king's"
2350,ENDNOTES:,foes was told that no one craved the gold they proffered. For their
2351,ENDNOTES:,loved friends at home the battle-weary warriors longed. Many a shield
2352,ENDNOTES:,full of treasure was then brought forth which the king dealt out
2353,ENDNOTES:,"unweighed to his many friends, to each five hundred marks of gold, and"
2354,ENDNOTES:,"to a few, still more. Gernot, the brave, had counseled Gunther this."
2355,ENDNOTES:,"Then they all took leave, sith they would hence. One saw the guests"
2356,ENDNOTES:,draw nigh to Kriemhild and also to where Dame Uta sate. Never yet were
2357,ENDNOTES:,"knights dismissed in better wise. Lodgings grew empty as they rode away,"
2358,ENDNOTES:,but still there stayed at home the king and all his kin and many a noble
2359,ENDNOTES:,liegeman. Daily they were seen as they went to Lady Kriemhild. The good
2360,ENDNOTES:,knight Siegfried now would likewise take his leave; he weened not to win
2361,ENDNOTES:,"that on which his mind was set. The king heard said that he would hence,"
2362,ENDNOTES:,"but Giselher, the youth, quite won him from the journey."
2363,ENDNOTES:,
2364,ENDNOTES:,"""Whither would ye ride now, noble Siegfried? Pray tarry with the"
2365,ENDNOTES:,"knights, I beg you, with Gunther the king and with his men. Here, too,"
2366,ENDNOTES:,"are many comely dames whom we shall gladly let you see."""
2367,ENDNOTES:,
2368,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the mighty Siegfried: ""Let stand the steeds. I listed to ride"
2369,ENDNOTES:,"hence, but now will I desist. The shields, too, bear away. To my land I"
2370,ENDNOTES:,"craved to go, in truth, but Giselher with his great love hath turned me"
2371,ENDNOTES:,"from it."""
2372,ENDNOTES:,
2373,ENDNOTES:,"So the valiant knight stayed on to please his friends, nor could he"
2374,ENDNOTES:,have fared more gentilly in any land. This happed because he daily saw
2375,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild, the fair; for the sake of her unmeasured beauty the lording"
2376,ENDNOTES:,"stayed. With many a pastime they whiled the hours away, but still her"
2377,ENDNOTES:,love constrained him and often gave him dole. Because of this same love
2378,ENDNOTES:,in later days the valiant knight lay pitiful in death.

2384,ENDNOTES:,
2385,ENDNOTES:,New tidings came across the Rhine. 'Twas said that yonder many a fair
2386,ENDNOTES:,maid dwelt. The good king Gunther thought to win him one of these; high
2387,ENDNOTES:,therefore rose the warrior's spirits. There lived a queen beyond the
2388,ENDNOTES:,"sea, whose like men knew not anywhere. Peerless was her beauty and great"
2389,ENDNOTES:,her strength. With doughty knights she shot the shaft for love. The
2390,ENDNOTES:,stone she hurled afar and sprang far after it. He who craved her love
2391,ENDNOTES:,must win without fail three games from this high-born dame. When the
2392,ENDNOTES:,"noble maid had done this passing oft, a stately knight did hear it by"
2393,ENDNOTES:,"the Rhine. He turned his thoughts upon this comely dame, and so heroes"
2394,ENDNOTES:,must needs later lose their lives.
2395,ENDNOTES:,
2396,ENDNOTES:,One day when the king and his vassals sate and pondered to and fro in
2397,ENDNOTES:,"many a wise, whom their lord might take to wife, who would be fit to be"
2398,ENDNOTES:,"their lady and beseem the land, up spake the lord of the Rhinelands: ""I"
2399,ENDNOTES:,"will go down to the sea and hence to Brunhild, however it may go with"
2400,ENDNOTES:,me. For her love I'll risk my life. I will gladly lose it and she become
2401,ENDNOTES:,"not my wife."""
2402,ENDNOTES:,
2403,ENDNOTES:,"""Against that do I counsel you,"" spake then Siegfried, ""if, as ye say,"
2404,ENDNOTES:,"the queen doth have so fierce a wont, he who wooeth for her love will"
2405,ENDNOTES:,"pay full dear. Therefore should ye give over the journey."""

2431,ENDNOTES:,"with him hence the cloak which he, the bold hero, had won 'mid dangers"
2432,ENDNOTES:,"from a dwarf, Alberich he hight. These bold and mighty knights now made"
2433,ENDNOTES:,them ready for the journey. When Siegfried wore the Cloak of Darkness
2434,ENDNOTES:,he had strength enow: the force of full twelve men beside his own. With
2435,ENDNOTES:,"cunning arts he won the royal maid. This cloak was fashioned so, that"

2523,ENDNOTES:,"In fitting wise the lords took leave and parted hence. Kriemhild, the"

2526,ENDNOTES:,"fair silk of Zazamanc, (2) green as is the clover, they overlaid with"
2527,ENDNOTES:,"precious stones; that gave garments passing fair. Kriemhild herself, the"
2528,ENDNOTES:,"high-born maiden, cut them out. Whatso they had at hand of well-wrought"
2529,ENDNOTES:,"linings from the skin of foreign fish, but rarely seen of folk, they"
2530,ENDNOTES:,"covered now with silk, as was the wont to wear. (3) Now hear great"

2532,ENDNOTES:,"Libya, too, they had great store of the fairest silks which the kith of"
2533,ENDNOTES:,any king did ever win. Kriemhild made it well appear what love she bore
2534,ENDNOTES:,"the twain. Sith upon the proud journey they had set their minds, they"
2535,ENDNOTES:,deemed ermine to be well fit. (4) Upon this lay fine silk as black as
2536,ENDNOTES:,coal. This would still beseem all doughty knights at high festal tides.
2537,ENDNOTES:,From out a setting of Arabian gold there shone forth many a stone. The
2538,ENDNOTES:,"ladies' zeal, it was not small, forsooth; in seven weeks they wrought"

2540,ENDNOTES:,
2541,ENDNOTES:,"When now they all stood dight, (5) there was built for them in haste"
2542,ENDNOTES:,"upon the Rhine a sturdy little skiff, that should bear them downward"

2544,ENDNOTES:,warriors were told that the brave vestures they should wear were now
2545,ENDNOTES:,"prepared; as they had craved it, so it now was done. Then no"
2546,ENDNOTES:,longer would they tarry on the Rhine; they sent a message to their
2547,ENDNOTES:,"war-companions, if perchance they should care to view their new attire,"
2548,ENDNOTES:,"to see if it be too long or short. All was found in fitting measure,"
2549,ENDNOTES:,and for this they gave the ladies thanks. All who saw them could not but
2550,ENDNOTES:,aver that never in the world had they seen attire more fair. Therefore
2551,ENDNOTES:,they wore it gladly at the court. None wist how to tell of better
2552,ENDNOTES:,knightly weeds. Nor did they fail to give great thanks. Then the lusty
2553,ENDNOTES:,"knights craved leave to go, and this the lordings did in courtly wise."
2554,ENDNOTES:,Bright eyes grew dim and moist thereat from weeping.
2555,ENDNOTES:,
2556,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild spake: ""Dear brother, ye might better tarry here a while and"

2560,ENDNOTES:,
2561,ENDNOTES:,"I ween their hearts did tell them what would hap. All wept alike, no"

2564,ENDNOTES:,
2565,ENDNOTES:,"She spake: ""Sir Siegfried, let this dear brother of mine be commended"

2576,ENDNOTES:,stood at the easements. A high wind stirred the ship and sails; the
2577,ENDNOTES:,proud war fellowship embarked upon the Rhine.
2578,ENDNOTES:,
2579,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake King Gunther: ""Who shall be the captain of the ship?"""

2585,ENDNOTES:,So they parted merrily from out the Burgundian land. Siegfried quickly

2588,ENDNOTES:,knights set forth from land. With them they took rich food and eke good
2589,ENDNOTES:,"wine, the best that could be found along the Rhine. Their steeds stood"
2590,ENDNOTES:,fair; they had good easement. Their ship rode well; scant harm did hap
2591,ENDNOTES:,them. Their stout sheet-rope was tightened by the breeze. Twenty leagues
2592,ENDNOTES:,"they sailed, or ever came the night, with a good wind, downward toward"
2593,ENDNOTES:,the sea. These hard toils later brought the high-mettled warriors pain.
2594,ENDNOTES:,
2595,ENDNOTES:,"Upon the twelfth-day morning, as we hear say, the winds had borne them"
2596,ENDNOTES:,far away to Isenstein in Brunhild's land. To none save Siegfried was
2597,ENDNOTES:,this known; but when King Gunther spied so many castles and broad
2598,ENDNOTES:,"marches, too, how soon he spake: ""Pray tell me, friend Siegfried, is it"

2600,ENDNOTES:,
2601,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried answered: ""I know it well. It is the land and folk of Brunhild"

2653,ENDNOTES:,
2654,ENDNOTES:,Meanwhile their bark had come so near the castle that the king saw many
2655,ENDNOTES:,a comely maiden standing at the casements. Much it irked King Gunther
2656,ENDNOTES:,"that he knew them not. He asked his comrade Siegfried: ""Hast thou no"
2657,ENDNOTES:,"knowledge of these maidens, who yonder are gazing downward towards us on"
2658,ENDNOTES:,"the flood? Whoever be their lord, they are of lofty mood."""
2659,ENDNOTES:,
2660,ENDNOTES:,"At this Sir Siegfried spake: ""I pray you, spy secretly among the"

2662,ENDNOTES:,"power."""
2663,ENDNOTES:,
2664,ENDNOTES:,"""That will I,"" spake Gunther, the bold and valiant knight. ""In yonder"
2665,ENDNOTES:,window do I see one stand in snow-white weeds. She is fashioned so fair
2666,ENDNOTES:,"that mine eyes would choose her for her comeliness. Had I power, she"
2667,ENDNOTES:,"should become my wife."""
2668,ENDNOTES:,
2669,ENDNOTES:,"""Right well thine eyes have chosen for thee. It is the noble Brunhild,"
2670,ENDNOTES:,"the comely maid, for whom thy heart doth strive and eke thy mind and"
2671,ENDNOTES:,"mood."" All her bearing seemed to Gunther good."
2672,ENDNOTES:,
2673,ENDNOTES:,"When bade the queen her high-born maids go from the windows, for it"
2674,ENDNOTES:,behooved them not to be the mark of strangers' eyes. Each one obeyed.
2675,ENDNOTES:,"What next the ladies did, hath been told us since. They decked their"
2676,ENDNOTES:,"persons out to meet the unknown knights, a way fair maids have ever"
2677,ENDNOTES:,"had. To the narrow casements they came again, where they had seen the"
2678,ENDNOTES:,knights. Through love of gazing this was done.
2679,ENDNOTES:,
2680,ENDNOTES:,But four there were that were come to land. Through the windows the
2681,ENDNOTES:,"stately women saw how Siegfried led a horse out on the sand, whereby"
2682,ENDNOTES:,"King Gunther felt himself much honored. By the bridle he held the steed,"
2683,ENDNOTES:,"so stately, good and fair, and large and strong, until King Gunther had"
2684,ENDNOTES:,"sat him in the saddle. Thus Siegfried served him, the which he later"
2685,ENDNOTES:,"quite forgot. Such service he had seldom done afore, that he should"
2686,ENDNOTES:,stand at any here's stirrup. Then he led his own steed from the ship.
2687,ENDNOTES:,All this the comely dames of noble birth saw through the casements. The
2688,ENDNOTES:,"steeds and garments, too, of the lusty knights, of snow-white hue, were"
2689,ENDNOTES:,"right well matched and all alike; the bucklers, fashioned well, gleamed"
2690,ENDNOTES:,in the hands of the stately men. In lordly wise they rode to Brunhild's
2691,ENDNOTES:,"hall, their saddles set with precious stones, with narrow martingales,"
2692,ENDNOTES:,from which hung bells of bright and ruddy gold. So they came to the
2693,ENDNOTES:,"land, as well befit their prowess, with newly sharpened spears, with"
2694,ENDNOTES:,"well-wrought swords, the which hung down to the spurs of these stately"
2695,ENDNOTES:,men. The swords the bold men bore were sharp and broad. All this
2696,ENDNOTES:,"Brunhild, the high-born maid, espied."
2697,ENDNOTES:,
2698,ENDNOTES:,"With the king came Dankwart and Hagen, too. We have heard tales told of"
2699,ENDNOTES:,"how the knights wore costly raiment, raven black of hue. Fair were their"
2700,ENDNOTES:,"bucklers, mickle, good and broad. Jewels they wore from the land of"
2701,ENDNOTES:,"India, the which gleamed gloriously upon their weeds. By the flood they"
2702,ENDNOTES:,left their skiff without a guard. Thus the brave knights and good
2703,ENDNOTES:,"rode to the castle. Six and eighty towers they saw within, three broad"
2704,ENDNOTES:,"palaces, (1) and one hall well wrought of costly marble, green as"
2705,ENDNOTES:,"grass, wherein Brunhild herself sate with her courtiers. The castle was"
2706,ENDNOTES:,unlocked and the gates flung wide. Then ran Brunhild's men to meet them
2707,ENDNOTES:,and welcomed the strangers into their mistress' land. One bade relieve
2708,ENDNOTES:,them of their steeds and shields.
2709,ENDNOTES:,
2710,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake a chamberlain: ""Pray give us now your swords and your shining"
2711,ENDNOTES:,"breastplates, too."""

2719,ENDNOTES:,
2720,ENDNOTES:,"Unwillingly Hagen, Gunther's man, obeyed. For the strangers men bade"

2725,ENDNOTES:,"Then the tidings were told to Lady Brunhild, that unknown warriors were"

2730,ENDNOTES:,

2734,ENDNOTES:,second of their fellowship is so worthy of praise that he were easily
2735,ENDNOTES:,"a mighty king over broad and princely lands, and he had the power and"
2736,ENDNOTES:,might possess them. One doth see him stand by the rest in such right
2737,ENDNOTES:,lordly wise. The third of the fellowship is so fierce and yet withal

2751,ENDNOTES:,"Brunhild, the fair, was soon well clad. Then went there with her many a"

2754,ENDNOTES:,"from Isenland, Brunhild's men-at-arms, five hundred or more, who bore"
2755,ENDNOTES:,swords in hand. This the strangers rued. From their seats then the brave

2819,ENDNOTES:,served a costly band upon which lay jewels green as grass. It shone and

2845,ENDNOTES:,must we lose our lives! Shall we now perish at the hands of women in

2847,ENDNOTES:,"Had but my brother Hagen his sword in hand, and I mine, too, then should"
2848,ENDNOTES:,"Brunhild's men go softly in their overweening pride. This know for sure,"
2849,ENDNOTES:,they'd guard against it well. And had I sworn a peace with a thousand
2850,ENDNOTES:,"oaths, before I'd see my dear lord die, the comely maid herself should"

2852,ENDNOTES:,
2853,ENDNOTES:,"""We might leave this land unscathed,"" spake then his brother Hagen, ""had"

2855,ENDNOTES:,"would the pride of this strong dame become a deal more soft."""
2856,ENDNOTES:,
2857,ENDNOTES:,What the warrior spake the noble maid heard well. Over her shoulders she
2858,ENDNOTES:,"gazed with smiling mouth. ""Now sith he thinketh himself so brave,"
2859,ENDNOTES:,bring them forth their coats-of-mail; put in the warriors' hands their
2860,ENDNOTES:,"sharp-edged swords."""
2861,ENDNOTES:,
2862,ENDNOTES:,"When they received their weapons as the maiden bade, bold Dankwart"
2863,ENDNOTES:,"blushed for very joy. ""Now let them play whatso they list,"" spake the"
2864,ENDNOTES:,"doughty man. ""Gunther is unconquered, since now we have our arms."""
2865,ENDNOTES:,
2866,ENDNOTES:,Mightily now did Brunhild's strength appear. Into the ring men bare a
2867,ENDNOTES:,"heavy stone, huge and great, mickle and round. Twelve brave and valiant"
2868,ENDNOTES:,"men-at-arms could scarcely bear it. This she threw at all times, when"
2869,ENDNOTES:,she had shot the spear. The Burgundians' fear now grew amain.
2870,ENDNOTES:,
2871,ENDNOTES:,"""Woe is me,"" cried Hagen. ""Whom hath King Gunther chosen for a love?"
2872,ENDNOTES:,"Certes she should be the foul fiend's bride in hell."""
2873,ENDNOTES:,
2874,ENDNOTES:,Upon her fair white arm the maid turned back her sleeves; with her hands
2875,ENDNOTES:,she grasped the shield and poised the spear on high. Thus the strife
2876,ENDNOTES:,"began. Gunther and Siegfried feared Brunhild's hate, and had Siegfried"
2877,ENDNOTES:,"not come to Gunther's aid, she would have bereft the king of life."
2878,ENDNOTES:,Secretly Siegfried went and touched his hand; with great fear Gunther
2879,ENDNOTES:,"marked his wiles. ""Who hath touched me?"" thought the valiant man. Then"
2880,ENDNOTES:,"he gazed around on every side, but saw none standing there."
2881,ENDNOTES:,
2882,ENDNOTES:,"""'Tis I, Siegfried, the dear friend of thine. Thou must not fear the"
2883,ENDNOTES:,queen. Give me the shield from off thy hand and let me bear it and mark
2884,ENDNOTES:,"aright what thou dost hear me say. Make thou the motions, I will do the"
2885,ENDNOTES:,"deeds."""
2886,ENDNOTES:,
2887,ENDNOTES:,"When Gunther knew that it was Siegfried, he was overjoyed."
2888,ENDNOTES:,
2889,ENDNOTES:,"Quoth Siegfried: ""Now hide thou my arts; tell them not to any man; then"
2890,ENDNOTES:,"can the queen win from thee little fame, albeit she doth desire it. See"
2891,ENDNOTES:,"how fearlessly the lady standeth now before thee."""
2892,ENDNOTES:,
2893,ENDNOTES:,"Then with might and main the noble maiden hurled the spear at a shield,"
2894,ENDNOTES:,"mickle, new, and broad, which the son of Siegelind bore upon his arm."
2895,ENDNOTES:,"The sparks sprang from the steel, as if the wind did blow. The edge of"
2896,ENDNOTES:,"the mighty spear broke fully through the shield, so that men saw the"
2897,ENDNOTES:,fire flame forth from the armor rings. The stalwart men both staggered
2898,ENDNOTES:,at the blow; but for the Cloak of Darkness they had lain there dead.
2899,ENDNOTES:,"From the mouth of Siegfried, the brave, gushed forth the blood. Quickly"
2900,ENDNOTES:,the good knight sprang back again and snatched the spear that she had
2901,ENDNOTES:,driven through his shield. Stout Siegfried's hand now sent it back
2902,ENDNOTES:,"again. He thought: ""I will not pierce the comely maid."" So he reversed"
2903,ENDNOTES:,"the point and cast it at her armor with the butt, that it rang out"
2904,ENDNOTES:,"loudly from his mighty hand. The sparks flew from the armor rings, as"
2905,ENDNOTES:,though driven by the wind. Siegmund's son had made the throw with might.
2906,ENDNOTES:,With all her strength she could not stand before the blow. In faith King
2907,ENDNOTES:,Gunther never could have done the deed.
2908,ENDNOTES:,
2909,ENDNOTES:,"Brunhild, the fair, how quickly up she sprang! ""Gunther, noble knight,"
2910,ENDNOTES:,"I cry you mercy for the shot."" She weened that he had done it with"
2911,ENDNOTES:,his strength. To her had crept a far more powerful man. Then went she
2912,ENDNOTES:,"quickly, angry was her mood. The noble maid and good raised high the"
2913,ENDNOTES:,stone and hurled it mightily far from her hand. After the cast she
2914,ENDNOTES:,"sprang, that all her armor rang, in truth. The stone had fallen twelve"
2915,ENDNOTES:,"fathoms hence, but with her leap the comely maid out-sprang the throw."
2916,ENDNOTES:,"Then went Sir Siegfried to where lay the stone. Gunther poised it, while"
2917,ENDNOTES:,"the hero made the throw. Siegfried was bold, strong, and tall; he threw"
2918,ENDNOTES:,the stone still further and made a broader jump. Through his fair arts
2919,ENDNOTES:,he had strength enow to bear King Gunther with him as he sprang. The
2920,ENDNOTES:,"leap was made, the stone lay on the ground; men saw none other save"
2921,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther, the knight, alone. Siegfried had banished the fear of King"
2922,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther's death. Brunhild, the fair, waxed red with wrath. To her"
2923,ENDNOTES:,"courtiers she spake a deal too loud, when she spied the hero safe and"
2924,ENDNOTES:,"sound at the border of the ring: ""Come nearer quickly, ye kinsmen and"
2925,ENDNOTES:,"liegemen of mine, ye must now be subject to Gunther, the king."""
2926,ENDNOTES:,
2927,ENDNOTES:,Then the brave knights laid aside their arms and paid their homage at
2928,ENDNOTES:,the feet of mighty Gunther from the Burgundian land. They weened that he
2929,ENDNOTES:,had won the games by his own strength alone. He greeted them in loving
2930,ENDNOTES:,wise; in sooth he was most rich in virtues.
2931,ENDNOTES:,
2932,ENDNOTES:,Then the lovely maiden took him by the hand; full power she granted him
2933,ENDNOTES:,"within the land. At this Hagen, the bold and doughty knight, rejoiced"
2934,ENDNOTES:,him. She bade the noble knight go with her hence to the spacious palace.
2935,ENDNOTES:,"When this was done, they gave the warriors with their service better"
2936,ENDNOTES:,cheer. With good grace Hagen and Dankwart now must needs submit. The
2937,ENDNOTES:,doughty Siegfried was wise enow and bare away his magic cloak. Then he
2938,ENDNOTES:,repaired to where the ladies sate. To the king he spake and shrewdly
2939,ENDNOTES:,"did he this: ""Why wait ye, good my lord? Why begin ye not the games, of"
2940,ENDNOTES:,which the queen doth deal so great a store? Let us soon see how they be
2941,ENDNOTES:,"played."" The crafty man did not as though he wist not a whit thereof."
2942,ENDNOTES:,
2943,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the Queen: ""How hath it chanced that ye, Sir Siegfried, have"
2944,ENDNOTES:,"seen naught of the games which the hand of Gunther here hath won?"""
2945,ENDNOTES:,
2946,ENDNOTES:,"To this Hagen of the Burgundian land made answer. He spake: ""Ye have"

2948,ENDNOTES:,ship when the lord of the Rhineland won from you the games. He knoweth
2949,ENDNOTES:,"naught thereof."""
2950,ENDNOTES:,
2951,ENDNOTES:,"""Well is me of this tale,"" spake Siegfried, the knight, ""that your pride"

2953,ENDNOTES:,"the power to be your master. Now, O noble maiden, must ye follow us"
2954,ENDNOTES:,"hence to the Rhine."""
2955,ENDNOTES:,
2956,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the fair-fashioned maid: ""That may not be. First must my kith"
2957,ENDNOTES:,"and liegemen learn of this. Certes, I may not so lightly void my lands;"
2958,ENDNOTES:,"my dearest friends must first be fetched."""
2959,ENDNOTES:,
2960,ENDNOTES:,"Then bade she messengers ride on every side. She called her friends,"
2961,ENDNOTES:,"her kinsmen, and her men-at-arms and begged them come without delay to"

3011,ENDNOTES:,"The hero rowed alone to a broad isle, where the lusty knight now beached"

3014,ENDNOTES:,came first to a gateway that stood fast locked. In sooth they guarded
3015,ENDNOTES:,"well their honor, as men still do. The stranger now gan knock upon"
3016,ENDNOTES:,"the door, the which was closely guarded. There within he saw a giant"
3017,ENDNOTES:,"standing, who kept the castle and at whose side lay at all times his"

3027,ENDNOTES:,"ran at Siegfried and asked, how he durst wake so many valiant men? Huge"
3028,ENDNOTES:,blows were dealt out by his hand. Then the lordly stranger gan defend
3029,ENDNOTES:,"him, but with an iron bar the warder shattered his shield-plates. Then"
3030,ENDNOTES:,"was the hero in dire need. Siegfried gan fear a deal his death, when the"
3031,ENDNOTES:,warder struck such mighty blows. Enow his master Siegfried loved him for
3032,ENDNOTES:,this cause. They strove so sore that all the castle rang and the sound
3033,ENDNOTES:,"was heard in Nibelung's hall. He overcame the warder and bound him, too."
3034,ENDNOTES:,
3035,ENDNOTES:,"The tale was noised abroad in all the Nibelungs' land. Alberich, the"

3037,ENDNOTES:,"He armed him quick and ran to where he found the noble stranger, as he"
3038,ENDNOTES:,bound the mighty giant. Full wroth was Alberich and strong enow. On his
3039,ENDNOTES:,body he bare helmet and rings of mail and in his hand a heavy scourge of
3040,ENDNOTES:,gold. Swift and hard he ran to where Siegfried stood. Seven heavy knobs
3041,ENDNOTES:,"(3) hung down in front, with which he smote so fiercely the shield upon"
3042,ENDNOTES:,"the bold man's arm, that it brake in parts. The stately stranger came in"
3043,ENDNOTES:,danger of his life. From his hand he flung the broken shield and thrust
3044,ENDNOTES:,"into the sheath a sword, the which was long. He would not strike his"
3045,ENDNOTES:,"servant dead, but showed his courtly breeding as his knightly virtue"
3046,ENDNOTES:,bade him. He rushed at Alberich and with his powerful hands he seized
3047,ENDNOTES:,"the gray-haired man by the beard. So roughly he pulled his beard, that"

3076,ENDNOTES:,Great store of tapers were now lit up; they proffered him mulled wine.

3091,ENDNOTES:,"upon the battlements. Then spake the queen: ""Knoweth any, who they be"

3197,ENDNOTES:,
3198,ENDNOTES:,"When they had thus fared on their way full nine days, Hagen of Troneg"
3199,ENDNOTES:,"spake: ""Now mark ye what I say. We wait too long with the tidings for"
3200,ENDNOTES:,"Worms upon the Rhine. Our messengers should be e'en now in Burgundy."""
3201,ENDNOTES:,
3202,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake King Gunther: ""Ye have told me true, and none be more fitting"
3203,ENDNOTES:,"for this trip than ye, friend Hagen; now ride ye to my land. None can"
3204,ENDNOTES:,"acquaint them better with our journey home to court."""
3205,ENDNOTES:,
3206,ENDNOTES:,"To this Hagen made answer: ""I am no fit envoy. Let me play chamberlain,"
3207,ENDNOTES:,"I'll stay with the ladies upon the flood and guard their robes, until"
3208,ENDNOTES:,"we bring them to the Burgundian land. Bid Siegfried bear the message, he"
3209,ENDNOTES:,knoweth how to do it well with his mighty strength. If he refuse you the
3210,ENDNOTES:,"journey, then must ye in courtly and gentle wise pray him of the boon"
3211,ENDNOTES:,"for your sister's sake."""
3212,ENDNOTES:,
3213,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther sent now for the warrior, who came to where he stood. He spake:"
3214,ENDNOTES:,"""Sith we be now nearing my lands at home, it behooveth me to send a"
3215,ENDNOTES:,"messenger to the dear sister of mine and to my mother, too, that we draw"

3218,ENDNOTES:,
3219,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, the passing bold man, however said him nay, till Gunther"

3222,ENDNOTES:,"as well as I."""
3223,ENDNOTES:,
3224,ENDNOTES:,"When Siegfried heard these words, full ready was the knight. ""Now bid me"
3225,ENDNOTES:,what ye will; naught shall be withheld. I will do it gladly for the fair
3226,ENDNOTES:,maid's sake. Why should I refuse her whom I bear in heart? Whatso ye

3228,ENDNOTES:,
3229,ENDNOTES:,"""Then tell my mother Uta, the queen, that we be of lofty mood upon this"

3239,ENDNOTES:,
3240,ENDNOTES:,"The good Lord Siegfried soon took leave of Lady Brunhild, as beseemed"
3241,ENDNOTES:,"him well, and of all her train; then rode he to the Rhine. Never might"
3242,ENDNOTES:,there be a better envoy in this world. He rode with four and twenty
3243,ENDNOTES:,men-at-arms to Worms; he came without the king. When that was noised
3244,ENDNOTES:,"about, the courtiers all were grieved; they feared their master had been"
3245,ENDNOTES:,slain.
3246,ENDNOTES:,
3247,ENDNOTES:,"Then they dismounted from their steeds, high stood their mood. Giselher,"
3248,ENDNOTES:,"the good young king, came soon to meet them, and Gernot his brother,"
3249,ENDNOTES:,"too. How quickly then he spake, when he saw not Gunther at Siegfried's"
3250,ENDNOTES:,"side: ""Be welcome, Siegfried; pray let me know where ye have left the"
3251,ENDNOTES:,"king my brother? The prowess of Brunhild, I ween, hath ta'en him from"

3259,ENDNOTES:,"in high estate."""
3260,ENDNOTES:,
3261,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Giselher, the youth: ""Now must ye go to her, for ye have"

3263,ENDNOTES:,"answer that the maid will see you gladly."""

3268,ENDNOTES:,
3269,ENDNOTES:,"Giselher then became the messenger, the stately man. The doughty knight"

3274,ENDNOTES:,"right tidings straight from Isenland."""
3275,ENDNOTES:,
3276,ENDNOTES:,"As yet the noble ladies were acquaint with fear, but now for their weeds"
3277,ENDNOTES:,they sprang and dressed them and bade Sir Siegfried come to court. This
3278,ENDNOTES:,"he did full gladly, for he was fain to see them. Kriemhild, the noble"
3279,ENDNOTES:,"maid, addressed him fair: ""Be welcome, Sir Siegfried, most worshipful"
3280,ENDNOTES:,"knight. Where is my brother Gunther, the noble and mighty king? We ween"
3281,ENDNOTES:,"that we have lost him through Brunhild's strength. Woe is me, poor maid,"
3282,ENDNOTES:,"that ever I was born."""
3283,ENDNOTES:,
3284,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the daring knight: ""Now give me an envoy's guerdon, ye"
3285,ENDNOTES:,"passing fair ladies, ye do weep without a cause. I do you to wit, I left"
3286,ENDNOTES:,him safe and sound. They have sent me with the tidings to you both. He
3287,ENDNOTES:,"and his bride do send you kindly greetings and a kinsman's love, O noble"

3289,ENDNOTES:,
3290,ENDNOTES:,In many a day she had not heard a tale so glad. With her snow-white
3291,ENDNOTES:,hem she wiped the tears from her pretty eyes and began to thank the
3292,ENDNOTES:,"messenger for the tidings, which now were come. Thus her great sorrow"
3293,ENDNOTES:,and her weeping were taken away. She bade the messenger be seated; full
3294,ENDNOTES:,"ready he was for this. Then spake the winsome maid: ""I should not rue"
3295,ENDNOTES:,"it, should I give you as an envoy's meed my gold. For that ye are too"
3296,ENDNOTES:,"rich, but I will be your friend in other ways."""
3297,ENDNOTES:,
3298,ENDNOTES:,"""And had I alone,"" spake he, ""thirty lands, yet would I gladly receive"
3299,ENDNOTES:,"gifts from your fair hand."""
3300,ENDNOTES:,
3301,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the courtly maid: ""It shall be done."" She bade her"
3302,ENDNOTES:,"chamberlain go fetch the meed for tidings. Four and twenty arm-rings,"
3303,ENDNOTES:,"set with goodly gold, she gave him as his meed. So stood the hero's mood"
3304,ENDNOTES:,"that he would not retain them, but gave them straightway to her nearest"
3305,ENDNOTES:,"maidens, he found within the bower. Full kindly her mother offered him"
3306,ENDNOTES:,"her service. ""I am to tell you the tale,"" then spake the valiant man,"
3307,ENDNOTES:,"""of what the king doth pray you, when he cometh to the Rhine. If ye"
3308,ENDNOTES:,"perform that, my lady, he'll ever hold you in his love. I heard him"
3309,ENDNOTES:,crave that ye should give fair greetings to his noble guests and grant
3310,ENDNOTES:,"him the boon, that ye ride to meet him out in front of Worms upon the"
3311,ENDNOTES:,"strand. This ye are right truly admonished by the king to do."""
3312,ENDNOTES:,
3313,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the winsome maid: ""For this am I full ready. In whatsoever"
3314,ENDNOTES:,"wise I can serve the king, that will I not refuse; with a kinsman's"
3315,ENDNOTES:,"love it shall be done."" Her color heightened for very joy. Never was the"
3316,ENDNOTES:,messenger of any prince received more fair. The lady would have kissed
3317,ENDNOTES:,"him, had she but dared. How lovingly he parted from the dames!"
3318,ENDNOTES:,
3319,ENDNOTES:,The men of Burgundy then did as Siegfried counseled. Sindolt and Hunolt
3320,ENDNOTES:,"and Rumolt, the knight, must needs be busy with the work of putting up"
3321,ENDNOTES:,"the seats outside of Worms upon the strand. The royal stewards, too,"
3322,ENDNOTES:,"were found at work. Ortwin and Gere would not desist, but sent to fetch"
3323,ENDNOTES:,"their friends on every side, and made known to them the feasting that"
3324,ENDNOTES:,was to be. The many comely maids arrayed themselves against the feast.
3325,ENDNOTES:,Everywhere the palace and the walls were decked out for the guests.
3326,ENDNOTES:,Gunther's hall was passing well purveyed for the many strangers. Thus
3327,ENDNOTES:,began full merrily this splendid feast.
3328,ENDNOTES:,
3329,ENDNOTES:,From every side along the highways of the land pricked now the kinsmen
3330,ENDNOTES:,"of these three kings, who had been called that they might wait upon"
3331,ENDNOTES:,those who were coming home. Then from the presses great store of costly
3332,ENDNOTES:,weeds was taken. Soon tidings were brought that men saw Brunhild's
3333,ENDNOTES:,kinsmen ride along. Great jostling then arose from the press of folk in
3334,ENDNOTES:,"the Burgundian land. Ho, what bold knights were found on either side!"
3335,ENDNOTES:,
3336,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake fair Kriemhild: ""Ye maids of mine, who would be with me at"
3337,ENDNOTES:,"the greeting, seek out from the guests the very best of robes; then will"
3338,ENDNOTES:,"praise and honor be given us by the guests."" Then came the warriors,"
3339,ENDNOTES:,"too, and bade the lordly saddles of pure red gold be carried forth,"
3340,ENDNOTES:,on which the ladies should ride from Worms down to the Rhine. Better
3341,ENDNOTES:,"trappings might there never be. Ho, what bright gold did sparkle on"
3342,ENDNOTES:,the jet-black palfreys! From their bridles there gleamed forth many a
3343,ENDNOTES:,precious stone. The golden stepping-blocks were brought and placed on
3344,ENDNOTES:,"shining carpets for the ladies, who were gay of mood. As I have said,"
3345,ENDNOTES:,the palfreys now stood ready in the courtyard for the noble maids. One
3346,ENDNOTES:,"saw the steeds wear narrow martingales of the best of silk, of which"
3347,ENDNOTES:,tale might be told. Six and eighty ladies who wore fillets (1) in their
3348,ENDNOTES:,hair were seen come forth. The fair ones came to Kriemhild wearing
3349,ENDNOTES:,"glittering robes. Then followed many a comely maid in brave attire,"
3350,ENDNOTES:,fifty and four from the Burgundian land. They were eke the best that
3351,ENDNOTES:,might anywhere be found. Men saw them walking with their flaxen hair and
3352,ENDNOTES:,shining ribbons. That which the king desired was done with zeal. They
3353,ENDNOTES:,"wore before the stranger knights rich cloth of silk, the best that"
3354,ENDNOTES:,"could be found, and so many a goodly robe, which well befit their ample"
3355,ENDNOTES:,beauty. One found there many clothes of sable and ermine fur. Many an
3356,ENDNOTES:,"arm and hand was well adorned with bracelets over the silken sleeves,"
3357,ENDNOTES:,which they should wear. None might tell the story of this tiring to the
3358,ENDNOTES:,"end. Many a hand played with well-wrought girdles, rich and long, above"
3359,ENDNOTES:,"gay colored robes, over costly ferran (2) skirts of silken cloth of"
3360,ENDNOTES:,Araby. In high spirits were these maids of noble birth. Clasps (3) were
3361,ENDNOTES:,sewed in lovely wise upon the dress of many a comely maid. She had good
3362,ENDNOTES:,"cause to rue it, whose bright color did not shine in contrast to her"
3363,ENDNOTES:,weeds. No kingly race hath now such fair retainers. When now the lovely
3364,ENDNOTES:,"maids had donned the garments they should wear, there then drew near a"
3365,ENDNOTES:,mickle band of high-mettled champions. Together with their shields they
3366,ENDNOTES:,carried many an ashen spear.
3367,ENDNOTES:,
3368,ENDNOTES:,
3369,ENDNOTES:,ENDNOTES:
3370,ENDNOTES:,"(1)  ""Fillets"" were worn only by married women."

3373,ENDNOTES:,"(3)  ""Clasps"" or ""brooches"" were used to fasten the dresses in"

3379,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE X. How Brunhild Was Received At Worms.
3380,ENDNOTES:,
3381,ENDNOTES:,Across the Rhine men saw the king with his guests in many bands pricking
3382,ENDNOTES:,"to the shore. One saw the horse of many a maiden, too, led by the"
3383,ENDNOTES:,bridle. All those who should give them welcome were ready now. When
3384,ENDNOTES:,those of Isenland and Siegfried's Nibelung men were come across in
3385,ENDNOTES:,"boats, they hasted to the shore (not idle were their hands), where the"
3386,ENDNOTES:,"kindred of the king were seen upon the other bank. Now hear this tale,"
3387,ENDNOTES:,"too, of the queen, the noble Uta, how she herself rode hither with the"
3388,ENDNOTES:,maidens from the castle. Then many a knight and maid became acquaint.
3389,ENDNOTES:,Duke Gere led Kriemhild's palfrey by the bridle till just outside
3390,ENDNOTES:,"the castle gate. Siegfried, the valiant knight, must needs attend her"
3391,ENDNOTES:,further. A fair maid was she! Later the noble dame requited well this
3392,ENDNOTES:,"deed. Ortwin, the bold, rode by Lady Uta's side, and many knights and"
3393,ENDNOTES:,maidens rode in pairs. Well may we aver that so many dames were never
3394,ENDNOTES:,seen together at such stately greeting. Many a splendid joust was
3395,ENDNOTES:,ridden by worshipful knights (not well might it be left undone) afore
3396,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild, the fair, down to the ships. Then the fair-fashioned ladies"
3397,ENDNOTES:,were lifted from the palfreys. The king was come across and many a
3398,ENDNOTES:,"worthy guest. Ho, what stout lances brake before the ladies' eyes! One"
3399,ENDNOTES:,"heard the clash of many hurtling shields. Ho, what costly bucklers rang"
3400,ENDNOTES:,loudly as they closed! The lovely fair stood by the shore as Gunther and
3401,ENDNOTES:,his guests alighted from the boats; he himself led Brunhild by the hand.
3402,ENDNOTES:,Bright gems and gleaming armor shone forth in rivalry. Lady Kriemhild
3403,ENDNOTES:,walked with courtly breeding to meet Dame Brunhild and her train.
3404,ENDNOTES:,"White hands removed the chaplets, (1) as these twain kissed each other;"
3405,ENDNOTES:,through deference this was done.
3406,ENDNOTES:,
3407,ENDNOTES:,"Then in courteous wise the maiden Kriemhild spake: ""Be ye welcome in"
3408,ENDNOTES:,"these lands of ours, to me and to my mother and to all the loyal kin we"
3409,ENDNOTES:,"have."""
3410,ENDNOTES:,
3411,ENDNOTES:,Low bows were made and the ladies now embraced full oft. Such loving
3412,ENDNOTES:,"greeting hath one never heard, as the two ladies, Dame Uta and her"
3413,ENDNOTES:,"daughter, gave the bride; upon her sweet mouth they kissed her oft. When"
3414,ENDNOTES:,"now Brunhild's ladies all were come to land, stately knights took many"
3415,ENDNOTES:,a comely woman by the hand in loving wise. The fair-fashioned maids were
3416,ENDNOTES:,seen to stand before the lady Brunhild. Long time elasped or ever the
3417,ENDNOTES:,"greetings all were done; many a rose-red mouth was kissed, in sooth."
3418,ENDNOTES:,"Still side by side the noble princesses stood, which liked full well"
3419,ENDNOTES:,the doughty warriors for to see. They who had heard men boast afore that
3420,ENDNOTES:,"such beauty had ne'er been seen as these two dames possessed, spied now"
3421,ENDNOTES:,with all their eyes and must confess the truth. Nor did one see upon
3422,ENDNOTES:,their persons cheats of any kind. Those who wot how to judge of women
3423,ENDNOTES:,"and lovely charms, praised Gunther's bride for beauty; but the wise had"
3424,ENDNOTES:,"seen more clear and spake, that one must give Kriemhild the palm before"
3425,ENDNOTES:,Brunhild.
3426,ENDNOTES:,
3427,ENDNOTES:,Maids and ladies now drew near each other. Many a comely dame was seen
3428,ENDNOTES:,"arrayed full well. Silken tents and many rich pavilions stood hard by,"
3429,ENDNOTES:,the which quite filled the plain of Worms. The kinsmen of the king came
3430,ENDNOTES:,"crowding around, when Brunhild and Kriemhild and with them all the dames"
3431,ENDNOTES:,were bidden go to where shade was found. Thither the knights from the
3432,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land escorted them.
3433,ENDNOTES:,
3434,ENDNOTES:,"Now were the strangers come to horse, and shields were pierced in many"
3435,ENDNOTES:,"royal jousts. From the plain the dust gan rise, as though the whole land"
3436,ENDNOTES:,had burst forth into flames. There many a knight became well known as
3437,ENDNOTES:,"champion. Many a maiden saw what there the warriors plied. Methinks,"
3438,ENDNOTES:,Sir Siegfried and his knights rode many a turn afore the tents. He led a
3439,ENDNOTES:,thousand stately Nibelungs.
3440,ENDNOTES:,
3441,ENDNOTES:,"Then Hagen of Troneg came, as the king had counseled, and parted in"
3442,ENDNOTES:,"gentle wise the jousting, that the fair maids be not covered with the"
3443,ENDNOTES:,"dust, the which the strangers willingly obeyed. Then spake Sir Gernot:"
3444,ENDNOTES:,"""Let stand the steeds till the air grow cooler, for ye must be full"
3445,ENDNOTES:,ready when that the king will ride. Meanwhile let us serve the comely
3446,ENDNOTES:,"dames before the spacious hall."""
3447,ENDNOTES:,
3448,ENDNOTES:,"When now over all the plain the jousts had ceased, the knights, on"
3449,ENDNOTES:,"pastime bent, hied them to the ladies under many a high pavilion in the"
3450,ENDNOTES:,hope of lofty joys. There they passed the hours until they were minded
3451,ENDNOTES:,to ride away.
3452,ENDNOTES:,
3453,ENDNOTES:,"Just at eventide, when the sun was setting and the air grew chill, no"
3454,ENDNOTES:,"longer they delayed, but man and woman hasted toward the castle. Many a"
3455,ENDNOTES:,comely maiden was caressed with loving glances. In jousting great store
3456,ENDNOTES:,"of clothes were torn by good knights, by the high-mettled warriors,"
3457,ENDNOTES:,"after the custom of the land, until the king dismounted by the hall."
3458,ENDNOTES:,"Valiant heroes helped the ladies, as is their wont. The noble queens"
3459,ENDNOTES:,then parted; Lady Uta and her daughter went with their train to a
3460,ENDNOTES:,"spacious hall, where great noise of merriment was heard on every side."
3461,ENDNOTES:,
3462,ENDNOTES:,"The seats were now made ready, for the king would go to table with his"
3463,ENDNOTES:,"guests. At his side men saw fair Brunhild stand, wearing the crown in"
3464,ENDNOTES:,"the king's domain. Royal enow she was in sooth. Good broad tables, with"
3465,ENDNOTES:,"full many benches for the men, were set with vitaille, as we are told."
3466,ENDNOTES:,Little they lacked that they should have! At the king's table many a
3467,ENDNOTES:,lordly guest was seen. The chamberlains of the host bare water forth in
3468,ENDNOTES:,"basins of ruddy gold. It were but in vain, if any told you that men were"
3469,ENDNOTES:,ever better served at princes' feasts: I would not believe you that.
3470,ENDNOTES:,
3471,ENDNOTES:,"Before the lord of the Rhineland took the water to wash his hands,"
3472,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried did as was but meet, he minded him by his troth of what he had"
3473,ENDNOTES:,"promised, or ever he had seen Brunhild at home in Isenland. He spake:"
3474,ENDNOTES:,"""Ye must remember how ye swore me by your hand, that when Lady Brunhild"
3475,ENDNOTES:,"came to this land, ye would give me your sister to wife. Where be now"
3476,ENDNOTES:,"these oaths? I have suffered mickle hardship on our trip."""
3477,ENDNOTES:,
3478,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the king to his guest: ""Rightly have ye minded me. Certes my"
3479,ENDNOTES:,"hand shall not be perjured. I'll bring it to pass as best I can."""
3480,ENDNOTES:,
3481,ENDNOTES:,Then they bade Kriemhild go to court before the king. She came with her
3482,ENDNOTES:,fair maidens to the entrance of the hall. At this Sir Giselher sprang
3483,ENDNOTES:,"down the steps. ""Now bid these maidens turn again. None save my sister"
3484,ENDNOTES:,"alone shall be here by the king."""
3485,ENDNOTES:,
3486,ENDNOTES:,Then they brought Kriemhild to where the king was found. There stood
3487,ENDNOTES:,noble knights from many princes' lands; throughout the broad hall one
3488,ENDNOTES:,bade them stand quite still. By this time Lady Brunhild had stepped
3489,ENDNOTES:,"to the table, too. Then spake King Gunther: ""Sweet sister mine, by thy"
3490,ENDNOTES:,"courtesie redeem my oath. I swore to give thee to a knight, and if he"
3491,ENDNOTES:,"become thy husband, then hast thou done my will most loyally."""
3492,ENDNOTES:,
3493,ENDNOTES:,"Quoth the noble maid: ""Dear brother mine, ye must not thus entreat me."
3494,ENDNOTES:,"Certes I'll be ever so, that whatever ye command, that shall be done."
3495,ENDNOTES:,"I'll gladly pledge my troth to him whom ye, my lord, do give me to"
3496,ENDNOTES:,"husband."""
3497,ENDNOTES:,
3498,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried here grew red at the glance of friendly eyes. The knight then
3499,ENDNOTES:,proffered his service to Lady Kriemhild. Men bade them take their stand
3500,ENDNOTES:,at each other's side within the ring and asked if she would take the
3501,ENDNOTES:,"stately man. In maidenly modesty she was a deal abashed, yet such was"
3502,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried's luck and fortune, that she would not refuse him out of hand."
3503,ENDNOTES:,"The noble king of Netherland vowed to take her, too, to wife. When he"
3504,ENDNOTES:,"and the maid had pledged their troths, Siegfried's arm embraced eftsoon"
3505,ENDNOTES:,the winsome maid. Then the fair queen was kissed before the knights. The
3506,ENDNOTES:,"courtiers parted, when that had happed; on the bench over against the"
3507,ENDNOTES:,king Siegfried was seen to take his scat with Kriemhild. Thither many
3508,ENDNOTES:,a man accompanied him as servitor; men saw the Nibelungs walk at
3509,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried's side.
3510,ENDNOTES:,
3511,ENDNOTES:,"The king had seated him with Brunhild, the maid, when she espied"
3512,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild (naught had ever irked her so) sitting at Siegfried's side.
3513,ENDNOTES:,She began to weep and hot tears coursed down fair cheeks. Quoth the lord
3514,ENDNOTES:,"of the land: ""What aileth you, my lady, that ye let bright eyes grow"
3515,ENDNOTES:,dim? Ye may well rejoice; my castles and my land and many a stately
3516,ENDNOTES:,"vassal own your sway."""
3517,ENDNOTES:,
3518,ENDNOTES:,"""I have good cause to weep,"" spake the comely maid; ""my heart is sore"
3519,ENDNOTES:,"because of thy sister, whom I see sitting so near thy vassal's side. I"
3520,ENDNOTES:,"must ever weep that she be so demeaned."""
3521,ENDNOTES:,
3522,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the King Gunther: ""Ye would do well to hold your peace. At"
3523,ENDNOTES:,another time I will tell you the tale of why I gave Siegfried my sister
3524,ENDNOTES:,"unto wife. Certes she may well live ever happily with the knight."""
3525,ENDNOTES:,
3526,ENDNOTES:,"She spake: ""I sorrow ever for her beauty and her courtesie. I fain would"
3527,ENDNOTES:,"flee, and I wist whither I might; go, for never will I lie close by"
3528,ENDNOTES:,"your side, unless ye tell me through what cause Kriemhild be Siegfried's"
3529,ENDNOTES:,"bride."""
3530,ENDNOTES:,
3531,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the noble king: ""I'll do it you to wit; he hath castles"
3532,ENDNOTES:,"and broad domains, as well as I. Know of a truth, he is a mighty king,"
3533,ENDNOTES:,"therefore did I give him the peerless maid to love."""
3534,ENDNOTES:,
3535,ENDNOTES:,"But whatsoever the king might say, she remained full sad of mood."
3536,ENDNOTES:,
3537,ENDNOTES:,Now many a good knight hastened from the board. Their hurtling waxed so
3538,ENDNOTES:,"passing hard, that the whole castle rang. But the host was weary of his"
3539,ENDNOTES:,guests. Him-thought that he might lie more soft at his fair lady's side.
3540,ENDNOTES:,As yet he had not lost at all the hope that much of joy might hap to him
3541,ENDNOTES:,through her. Lovingly he began to gaze on Lady Brunhild. Men bade the
3542,ENDNOTES:,"guests leave off their knightly games, for the king and his wife would"
3543,ENDNOTES:,go to bed. Brunhild and Kriemhild then met before the stairway of the
3544,ENDNOTES:,"hall, as yet without the hate of either. Then came their retinue. Noble"
3545,ENDNOTES:,"chamberlains delayed not, but brought them lights. The warriors, the"
3546,ENDNOTES:,"liegemen of the two kings, then parted on either side and many of the"
3547,ENDNOTES:,knights were seen to walk with Siegfried.
3548,ENDNOTES:,
3549,ENDNOTES:,The lords were now come to the rooms where they should lie. Each of the
3550,ENDNOTES:,twain thought to conquer by love his winsome dame. This made them blithe
3551,ENDNOTES:,of mood. Siegfried's pleasure on that night was passing great. When Lord
3552,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried lay at Kriemhild's side and with his noble love caressed the
3553,ENDNOTES:,"high-born maid so tenderly, she grew as dear to him as life, so that not"
3554,ENDNOTES:,for a thousand other women would he have given her alone. No more I'll
3555,ENDNOTES:,tell how Siegfried wooed his wife; hear now the tale of how King Gunther
3556,ENDNOTES:,lay by Lady Brunhild's side. The stately knight had often lain more
3557,ENDNOTES:,"soft by other dames. The courtiers now had left, both maid and man. The"
3558,ENDNOTES:,chamber soon was locked; he thought to caress the lovely maid. Forsooth
3559,ENDNOTES:,"the time was still far off, ere she became his wife. In a smock of snowy"
3560,ENDNOTES:,"linen she went to bed. Then thought the noble knight: ""Now have I here"
3561,ENDNOTES:,"all that I have ever craved in all my days."" By rights she must needs"
3562,ENDNOTES:,please him through her comeliness. The noble king gan shroud the lights
3563,ENDNOTES:,and then the bold knight hied him to where the lady lay. He laid him at
3564,ENDNOTES:,"her side, and great was his joy when in his arms he clasped the lovely"
3565,ENDNOTES:,"fair. Many loving caresses he might have given, had but the noble dame"
3566,ENDNOTES:,allowed it. She waxed so wroth that he was sore a-troubled; he weened
3567,ENDNOTES:,"that they were lovers, but he found here hostile hate. She spake: ""Sir"
3568,ENDNOTES:,"Knight, pray give this over, which now ye hope. Forsooth this may not"
3569,ENDNOTES:,"hap, for I will still remain a maid, until I hear the tale; now mark ye"
3570,ENDNOTES:,"that."""
3571,ENDNOTES:,
3572,ENDNOTES:,Then Gunther grew wroth; he struggled for her love and rumpled all her
3573,ENDNOTES:,"clothes. The high-born maid then seized her girdle, the which was a"
3574,ENDNOTES:,"stout band she wore around her waist, and with it she wrought the king"
3575,ENDNOTES:,great wrong enow. She bound him hand and foot and bare him to a nail and
3576,ENDNOTES:,"hung him on the wall. She forbade him love, sith he disturbed her sleep."
3577,ENDNOTES:,Of a truth he came full nigh to death through her great strength.
3578,ENDNOTES:,
3579,ENDNOTES:,"Then he who had weened to be the master, began to plead. ""Now loose my"
3580,ENDNOTES:,"bands, most noble queen. I no longer trow to conquer you, fair lady, and"
3581,ENDNOTES:,"full seldom will I lie so near your side."""
3582,ENDNOTES:,
3583,ENDNOTES:,"She reeked not how he felt, for she lay full soft. There he had to hang"
3584,ENDNOTES:,"all night till break of day, until the bright morn shone through the"
3585,ENDNOTES:,"casements. Had he ever had great strength, it was little seen upon him"
3586,ENDNOTES:,now.
3587,ENDNOTES:,
3588,ENDNOTES:,"""Now tell me, Sir Gunther, would that irk you aught,"" the fair maid"
3589,ENDNOTES:,"spake, ""and your servants found you bound by a woman's hand?"""
3590,ENDNOTES:,
3591,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the noble knight: ""That would serve you ill; nor would it"
3592,ENDNOTES:,"gain me honor,"" spake the doughty man. ""By your courtesie, pray let me"
3593,ENDNOTES:,"lie now by your side. Sith that my love mislike you so, I will not touch"
3594,ENDNOTES:,"your garment with my hands."""
3595,ENDNOTES:,
3596,ENDNOTES:,"Then she loosed him soon and let him rise. To the bed again, to the lady"
3597,ENDNOTES:,"he went and laid him down so far away, that thereafter he full seldom"
3598,ENDNOTES:,touched her comely weeds. Nor would she have allowed it.
3599,ENDNOTES:,
3600,ENDNOTES:,"Then their servants came and brought them new attire, of which great"
3601,ENDNOTES:,"store was ready for them against the morn. However merry men made, the"
3602,ENDNOTES:,"lord of the land was sad enow, albeit he wore a crown that day. As"
3603,ENDNOTES:,"was the usage which they had and which they kept by right, Gunther and"
3604,ENDNOTES:,"Brunhild no longer tarried, but hied them to the minster, where mass was"
3605,ENDNOTES:,"sung. Thither, too, Sir Siegfried came and a great press arose among the"
3606,ENDNOTES:,"crowd. In keeping with their royal rank, there was ready for them all"
3607,ENDNOTES:,"that they did need, their crowns and robes as well. Then they were"
3608,ENDNOTES:,"consecrated. When this was done, all four were seen to stand joyful"
3609,ENDNOTES:,"'neath their crowns. Many young squires, six hundred or better, were now"
3610,ENDNOTES:,"girt with sword in honor of the kings, as ye must know. Great joy rose"
3611,ENDNOTES:,then in the Burgundian land; one heard spear-shafts clashing in the
3612,ENDNOTES:,hands of the sworded knights. There at the windows the fair maids sat;
3613,ENDNOTES:,they saw shining afore them the gleam of many a shield. But the king had
3614,ENDNOTES:,"sundered him from his liegemen; whatso others plied, men saw him stand"
3615,ENDNOTES:,full sad. Unlike stood his and Siegfried's mood. The noble knight and
3616,ENDNOTES:,good would fain have known what ailed the king. He hasted to him and gan
3617,ENDNOTES:,"ask: ""Pray let me know how ye have fared this night, Sir King."""
3618,ENDNOTES:,
3619,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the king to his guest: ""Shame and disgrace have I won; I have"
3620,ENDNOTES:,"brought a fell devil to my house and home. When I weened to love her,"
3621,ENDNOTES:,she bound me sore; she bare me to a nail and hung me high upon a wall.
3622,ENDNOTES:,"There I hung affrighted all night until the day, or ever she unbound me."
3623,ENDNOTES:,How softly she lay bedded there! In hope of thy pity do I make plaint to
3624,ENDNOTES:,"thee as friend to friend."""
3625,ENDNOTES:,
3626,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake stout Siegfried: ""That rueth me in truth. I'll do you this to"
3627,ENDNOTES:,"wit; and ye allow me without distrust, I'll contrive that she lie by you"
3628,ENDNOTES:,"so near this night, that she'll nevermore withhold from you her love."""
3629,ENDNOTES:,
3630,ENDNOTES:,After all his hardships Gunther liked well this speech. Sir Siegfried
3631,ENDNOTES:,"spake again: ""Thou mayst well be of good cheer. I ween we fared unlike"
3632,ENDNOTES:,last night. Thy sister Kriemhild is dearer to me than life; the Lady
3633,ENDNOTES:,Brunhild must become thy wife to-night. I'll come to thy chamber this
3634,ENDNOTES:,"night, so secretly in my Cloud Cloak, that none may note at all my arts."
3635,ENDNOTES:,Then let the chamberlains betake them to their lodgings and I'll put out
3636,ENDNOTES:,"the lights in the pages' hands, whereby thou mayst know that I be within"
3637,ENDNOTES:,"and that I'll gladly serve thee. I'll tame for time thy wife, that thou"
3638,ENDNOTES:,"mayst have her love to-night, or else I'll lose my life."""
3639,ENDNOTES:,
3640,ENDNOTES:,"""Unless be thou embrace my dear lady,"" spake then the king, ""I shall be"
3641,ENDNOTES:,"glad, if thou do to her as thou dost list. I could endure it well, an'"
3642,ENDNOTES:,"thou didst take her life. In sooth she is a fearful wife."""
3643,ENDNOTES:,
3644,ENDNOTES:,"""I pledge upon my troth,"" quoth Siegfried, ""that I will not embrace her."
3645,ENDNOTES:,"The fair sister of thine, she is to me above all maids that I have ever"
3646,ENDNOTES:,"seen."""
3647,ENDNOTES:,
3648,ENDNOTES:,Gunther believed full well what Siegfried spake.
3649,ENDNOTES:,
3650,ENDNOTES:,From the knightly sports there came both joy and woe; but men forbade
3651,ENDNOTES:,"the hurtling and the shouting, since now the ladies were to hie them to"
3652,ENDNOTES:,the hall. The grooms-in-waiting bade the people stand aside; the court
3653,ENDNOTES:,"was cleared of steeds and folk. A bishop led each of the ladies, as they"
3654,ENDNOTES:,should go to table in the presence of the kings. Many a stately warrior
3655,ENDNOTES:,followed to the seats. In fair hope the king sate now full merrily; well
3656,ENDNOTES:,he thought on that which Siegfried had vowed to do. This one day thought
3657,ENDNOTES:,"him as long as thirty days, for all his thoughts were bent upon his"
3658,ENDNOTES:,lady's love. He could scarce abide the time to leave the board. Now men
3659,ENDNOTES:,"let fair Brunhild and Kriemhild, too, both go to their rest. Ho, what"
3660,ENDNOTES:,doughty knights were seen to walk before the queens!
3661,ENDNOTES:,
3662,ENDNOTES:,"The Lord Siegfried sate in loving wise by his fair wife, in bliss"
3663,ENDNOTES:,"without alloy. With her snow-white hands she fondled his, till that he"
3664,ENDNOTES:,"vanished from before her eyes, she wist not when. When now she no longer"
3665,ENDNOTES:,"spied him, as she toyed, the queen spake to his followers: ""Much this"
3666,ENDNOTES:,"wondereth me, whither the king be gone. Who hath taken his hands from"
3667,ENDNOTES:,"mine?"""
3668,ENDNOTES:,
3669,ENDNOTES:,"She spake no other word, but he was gone to where he found many grooms"
3670,ENDNOTES:,of the chamber stand with lights. These he gan snuff out in the pages'
3671,ENDNOTES:,hands. Thus Gunther knew that it was Siegfried. Well wist he what he
3672,ENDNOTES:,"would; he bade the maids and ladies now withdraw. When that was done,"
3673,ENDNOTES:,the mighty king himself made fast the door and nimbly shoved in place
3674,ENDNOTES:,two sturdy bolts. Quickly then he hid the lights behind the hangings of
3675,ENDNOTES:,the bed. Stout Siegfried and the maiden now began a play (for this there
3676,ENDNOTES:,was no help) which was both lief and loth to Gunther. Siegfried laid him
3677,ENDNOTES:,"close by the high-born maid. She spake: ""Now, Gunther, let that be, and"
3678,ENDNOTES:,"it be lief to you, that ye suffer not hardship as afore."""
3679,ENDNOTES:,
3680,ENDNOTES:,Then the lady hurt bold Siegfried sore. He held his peace and answered
3681,ENDNOTES:,"not a whit. Gunther heard well, though he could not see his friend a"
3682,ENDNOTES:,"bit, that they plied not secret things, for little ease they had upon"
3683,ENDNOTES:,"the bed. Siegfried bare him as though he were Gunther, the mighty king."
3684,ENDNOTES:,In his arms he clasped the lovely maid. She cast him from the bed upon
3685,ENDNOTES:,"a bench near by, so that his head struck loudly against the stool. Up"
3686,ENDNOTES:,sprang the valiant man with all his might; fain would he try again. When
3687,ENDNOTES:,"he thought now to subdue her, she hurt him sore. Such defense, I ween,"
3688,ENDNOTES:,might nevermore be made by any wife.
3689,ENDNOTES:,
3690,ENDNOTES:,"When he would not desist, up sprang the maid. ""Ye shall not rumple thus"
3691,ENDNOTES:,"my shift so white. Ye are a clumsy churl and it shall rue you sore,"
3692,ENDNOTES:,"I'll have you to know fall well,"" spake the comely maid. In her arms she"
3693,ENDNOTES:,"grasped the peerless knight; she weened to bind him, as she had done the"
3694,ENDNOTES:,"king, that she might have her case upon the bed. The lady avenged full"
3695,ENDNOTES:,"sore, that he had rumpled thus her clothes. What availed his mickle"
3696,ENDNOTES:,force and his giant strength? She showed the knight her masterly
3697,ENDNOTES:,strength of limb; she carried him by force (and that must needs be) and
3698,ENDNOTES:,pressed him rudely 'twixt a clothes-press and the wall.
3699,ENDNOTES:,
3700,ENDNOTES:,"""Alas,"" so thought the knight, ""if now I lose my life at a maiden's"
3701,ENDNOTES:,"hands, then may all wives hereafter bear towards their husbands haughty"
3702,ENDNOTES:,"mien, who would never do it else."""
3703,ENDNOTES:,
3704,ENDNOTES:,The king heard it well and feared him for his liegeman's life. Siegfried
3705,ENDNOTES:,was sore ashamed; wrathful he waxed and with surpassing strength he set
3706,ENDNOTES:,himself against her and tried it again with Lady Brunhild in fearful
3707,ENDNOTES:,"wise. It thought the king full long, before he conquered her. She"
3708,ENDNOTES:,"pressed his hands, till from her strength the blood gushed forth from"
3709,ENDNOTES:,out the nails: this irked the hero. Therefore he brought the high-born
3710,ENDNOTES:,"maiden to the pass that she gave over her unruly will, which she"
3711,ENDNOTES:,"asserted there afore. The king heard all, albeit not a word he spake."
3712,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried pressed her against the bed, so that she shrieked aloud."
3713,ENDNOTES:,Passing sore his strength did hurt her. She grasped the girdle around
3714,ENDNOTES:,"her waist and would fain have bound him, but his hand prevented it in"
3715,ENDNOTES:,such a wise that her limbs and all her body cracked. Thus the strife was
3716,ENDNOTES:,parted and she became King Gunther's wife.
3717,ENDNOTES:,
3718,ENDNOTES:,"She spake: ""Most noble king, pray spare my life. I'll do thee remedy for"
3719,ENDNOTES:,whatso I have done thee. I'll no longer struggle against thy noble
3720,ENDNOTES:,"love, for I have learned full well that thou canst make thee master over"
3721,ENDNOTES:,"women."""
3722,ENDNOTES:,
3723,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried let the maiden be and stepped away, as though he would do off"
3724,ENDNOTES:,"his clothes. From her hand he drew a golden finger ring, without that"
3725,ENDNOTES:,"she wist it, the noble queen. Thereto he took her girdle, a good stout"
3726,ENDNOTES:,band. I know not if he did that for very haughtiness. He gave it to his
3727,ENDNOTES:,wife and rued it sore in after time.
3728,ENDNOTES:,
3729,ENDNOTES:,"Then lay Gunther and the fair maid side by side. He played the lover,"
3730,ENDNOTES:,"as beseemed him, and thus she must needs give over wrath and shame. From"
3731,ENDNOTES:,"his embrace a little pale she grew. Ho, how her great strength failed"
3732,ENDNOTES:,through love! Now was she no stronger than any other wife. He caressed
3733,ENDNOTES:,"her lovely form in lover's wise. Had she tried her strength again, what"
3734,ENDNOTES:,had that availed? All this had Gunther wrought in her by his love. How
3735,ENDNOTES:,right lovingly she lay beside him in bridal joy until the dawn of day!
3736,ENDNOTES:,
3737,ENDNOTES:,Now was Sir Siegfried gone again to where he was given fair greetings by
3738,ENDNOTES:,a woman fashioned fair. He turned aside the question she had thought to
3739,ENDNOTES:,"put and hid long time from her what he had brought, until she ruled as"
3740,ENDNOTES:,queen within his land. How little he refused to give her what he should!
3741,ENDNOTES:,
3742,ENDNOTES:,On the morn the host was far cheerier of mood than he had been afore.
3743,ENDNOTES:,"Through this the joy of many a noble man was great in all his lands,"
3744,ENDNOTES:,"whom he had bidden to his court, and to whom he proffered much of"
3745,ENDNOTES:,"service. The wedding feast now lasted till the fourteenth day, so that"
3746,ENDNOTES:,in all this while the sound never died away of the many joys which there
3747,ENDNOTES:,they plied. The cost to the king was rated high. The kinsmen of the
3748,ENDNOTES:,"noble host gave gifts in his honor to the strolling folk, as the king"
3749,ENDNOTES:,"commanded: vesture and ruddy gold, steeds and silver, too. Those who"
3750,ENDNOTES:,"there craved gifts departed hence full merrily. Siegfried, the lord from"
3751,ENDNOTES:,"Netherland, with a thousand of his men, gave quite away the garments"
3752,ENDNOTES:,"they had brought with them to the Rhine and steeds and saddles, too."
3753,ENDNOTES:,Full well they wot how to live in lordly wise. Those who would home
3754,ENDNOTES:,again thought the time too long till the rich gifts had all been made.
3755,ENDNOTES:,Nevermore have guests been better eased. Thus ended the wedding feast;

3770,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE XI. How Siegfried Journeyed Homeward With His Wife.
3771,ENDNOTES:,
3772,ENDNOTES:,"When now the strangers had all ridden hence, Siegmund's son spake to his"
3773,ENDNOTES:,"fellowship: ""We must make us ready, too, to journey to my lands."""
3774,ENDNOTES:,
3775,ENDNOTES:,"Lief was it to his wife, when the lady heard the tale aright. She spake"
3776,ENDNOTES:,"to her husband: ""When shall we ride? I pray thee, make me not haste too"
3777,ENDNOTES:,"sore. First must my brothers share their lands with me."""
3778,ENDNOTES:,
3779,ENDNOTES:,"It was loth to Siegfried, when he heard this from Kriemhild. The"
3780,ENDNOTES:,"lordings hied them to him and all three spake: ""Now may ye know, Sir"
3781,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, that our true service be ever at your bidding till our"
3782,ENDNOTES:,"death."""
3783,ENDNOTES:,
3784,ENDNOTES:,"Then he made obeisance to the knights, as it was proffered him in such"
3785,ENDNOTES:,"kindly wise. ""We shall share with you,"" spake Giselher, the youth, ""both"
3786,ENDNOTES:,land and castles which we do own and whatever broad realms be subject to
3787,ENDNOTES:,"our power. Of these ye and Kriemhild shall have a goodly share."""
3788,ENDNOTES:,
3789,ENDNOTES:,"The son of Siegmund spake to the princes, as he heard and saw the"
3790,ENDNOTES:,"lordings' will: ""God grant that ye be ever happy with your heritage and"
3791,ENDNOTES:,the folk therein. My dear bride can well forego in truth the share which
3792,ENDNOTES:,"ye would give. There where she shall wear a crown, she shall be mightier"
3793,ENDNOTES:,"than any one alive, and live to see the day. For whatsoever else ye do"
3794,ENDNOTES:,"command, I stand ready to your bidding."""
3795,ENDNOTES:,
3796,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: ""Though ye forego my heritage, yet is"
3797,ENDNOTES:,it not so light a matter with the Burgundian men-at-arms. A king might
3798,ENDNOTES:,gladly lead them to his land. Forsooth my brothers' hands must share
3799,ENDNOTES:,"them with me."""
3800,ENDNOTES:,
3801,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the Lord Gernot: ""Now take whomsoever thou dost wish. Thou"
3802,ENDNOTES:,wilt find here really a one who'll gladly ride with thee. We will
3803,ENDNOTES:,give thee a thousand of our thirty hundred warriors; be they thy court
3804,ENDNOTES:,"retainers."""
3805,ENDNOTES:,
3806,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild then gan send for Hagen of Troneg and also for Ortwin, to ask"
3807,ENDNOTES:,if they and their kinsfolk would be Kriemhild's men.
3808,ENDNOTES:,
3809,ENDNOTES:,"At this Hagen waxed wonderly wroth. He spake: ""Certes, Gunther may not"

3811,ENDNOTES:,full well the custom of the men of Troneg: we must in duty bound remain

3813,ENDNOTES:,"now have followed."""
3814,ENDNOTES:,
3815,ENDNOTES:,They gave that over and made them ready to ride away. Lady Kriemhild
3816,ENDNOTES:,"gained for herself two and thirty maids and five hundred men, a noble"

3818,ENDNOTES:,"took leave, both knights and squires and maids and ladies, as was mickle"
3819,ENDNOTES:,right. Anon they parted with a kiss and voided merrily King Gunther's
3820,ENDNOTES:,land. Their kinsmen bare them company far upon the way and bade them

3824,ENDNOTES:,"Then messengers were sent eftsoon to Siegmund, that he might know,"
3825,ENDNOTES:,"and Siegelind, too, that his son would come with Lady Uta's child,"
3826,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild, the fair, from Worms beyond the Rhine. Liefer tidings might"
3827,ENDNOTES:,"they never have. ""Well for me,"" spake then Siegmund, ""that I have"
3828,ENDNOTES:,lived to see fair Kriemhild here as queen. My heritage will be thereby
3829,ENDNOTES:,"enhanced. My son, the noble Siegfried, shall himself be king."""
3830,ENDNOTES:,
3831,ENDNOTES:,"Then the Lady Siegelind gave much red velvet, silver, and heavy gold;"
3832,ENDNOTES:,"this was the envoy's meed. The tale well liked her, which then she"
3833,ENDNOTES:,"heard. She clad her and her handmaids with care, as did beseem them. Men"
3834,ENDNOTES:,told who was to come with Siegfried to the land. Anon they bade seats be
3835,ENDNOTES:,"raised, where he should walk crowned before his friends. King Siegmund's"
3836,ENDNOTES:,liegemen then rode forth to meet him. Hath any been ever better greeted
3837,ENDNOTES:,"than the famous hero in Siegmund's land, I know not. Siegelind, the"
3838,ENDNOTES:,"fair, rode forth to meet Kriemhild with many a comely dame (lusty"
3839,ENDNOTES:,"knights did follow on behind), a full day's journey, till one espied the"
3840,ENDNOTES:,guests. Home-folk and the strangers had little easement till they were
3841,ENDNOTES:,"come to a spacious castle, hight Xanten, (2) where they later reigned."
3842,ENDNOTES:,
3843,ENDNOTES:,Smilingly Siegelind and Siegmund kissed Kriemhild many times for joy and
3844,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, too; their sorrow was taken from them. All their fellowship"
3845,ENDNOTES:,received great welcome. One bade now bring the guests to Siegmund's
3846,ENDNOTES:,"hall, and lifted the fair young maids down from the palfreys. Many a"
3847,ENDNOTES:,knight gan serve the comely dames with zeal. However great the feasting
3848,ENDNOTES:,"at the Rhine was known to be, here one gave the heroes much better robes"
3849,ENDNOTES:,than they had worn in all their days. Of their splender great marvels
3850,ENDNOTES:,"might be told. When now they sate in lofty honors and had enow of all,"
3851,ENDNOTES:,what gold-hued clothes their courtiers wore with precious stones well
3852,ENDNOTES:,"worked thereon! Thus did Siegelind, the noble queen, purvey them well."
3853,ENDNOTES:,
3854,ENDNOTES:,"Then to his friends Lord Siegmund spake: ""I do all Siegfried's kin"
3855,ENDNOTES:,"to wit, that he shall wear my crown before these knights."" Those of"
3856,ENDNOTES:,"Netherland heard full fain the tale. He gave his son the crown, the"
3857,ENDNOTES:,"cognizance, (3) and lands, so that he then was master of them all. When"
3858,ENDNOTES:,"that men went to law and Siegfried uttered judgment, that was done in"
3859,ENDNOTES:,such a wise that men feared sore fair Kriemhild's husband.
3860,ENDNOTES:,
3861,ENDNOTES:,"In these high honors Siegfried lived, of a truth, and judged as king,"
3862,ENDNOTES:,"till the tenth year was come, when his fair lady bare a son. This was"
3863,ENDNOTES:,come to pass after the wish of the kinsmen of the king. They hastened
3864,ENDNOTES:,to baptize and name him Gunther for his uncle; nor had he need to be
3865,ENDNOTES:,"ashamed of this. Should he grow like to his kinsman, he would fare full"
3866,ENDNOTES:,"well. They brought him up with care, as was but due. In these same times"
3867,ENDNOTES:,"the Lady Siegelind died, and men enow made wail when death bereft them"
3868,ENDNOTES:,of her. Then the child of the noble Uta held withal the power over the
3869,ENDNOTES:,"lands, which well beseemed such high-born dames. (4)"
3870,ENDNOTES:,
3871,ENDNOTES:,"Now also by the Rhine, as we hear tell, at mighty Gunther's court, in"
3872,ENDNOTES:,"the Burgundian land, Brunhild, the fair, had born a son. For the hero's"
3873,ENDNOTES:,sake they named him Siegfried. With what great care they bade attend
3874,ENDNOTES:,him! The noble Gunther gave him masters who well wot how to bring him
3875,ENDNOTES:,"up to be a doughty man. Alas, what great loss of kin he later suffered"
3876,ENDNOTES:,through misfortune!
3877,ENDNOTES:,
3878,ENDNOTES:,"Many tales were told all time, of how right worshipfully the lusty"
3879,ENDNOTES:,knights dwelt alway in Siegmund's land. Gunther dealt the same with his
3880,ENDNOTES:,distinguished kin. The Nibelung land and Schilbung's knights and the
3881,ENDNOTES:,goods of both served Siegfried here (none of his kinsmen ever waxed
3882,ENDNOTES:,mightier than he). So much the higher rose the mood of the valiant man.
3883,ENDNOTES:,"The very greatest heard that any hero ever gained, save those who owned"
3884,ENDNOTES:,"it aforetime, the bold man had, the which he had won by his own hand"
3885,ENDNOTES:,"hard by a hill, and for which he did many a lusty knight to death. He"
3886,ENDNOTES:,"had honors to his heart's desire, and had this not been so, yet one must"
3887,ENDNOTES:,"rightly aver of the noble champion, that he was one of the best that"

3901,ENDNOTES:,
3902,ENDNOTES:,"Now Gunther's wife thought alway: ""How haughtily doth Lady Kriemhild"
3903,ENDNOTES:,bear her! Is not her husband Siegfried our liegeman? Long time now hath
3904,ENDNOTES:,"he done us little service."" This she bare within her heart, but held her"
3905,ENDNOTES:,peace. It irked her sore that they did make themselves such strangers
3906,ENDNOTES:,and that men from Siegfried's land so seldom served her. Fain would she
3907,ENDNOTES:,have known from whence this came. She asked the king if it might hap
3908,ENDNOTES:,that she should see Kriemhild again. Secretly she spake what she had in
3909,ENDNOTES:,"mind. The speech like the king but moderately well. ""How might we bring"
3910,ENDNOTES:,"them,"" quoth he, ""hither to our land? That were impossible, they live"

3912,ENDNOTES:,
3913,ENDNOTES:,"To this Brunhild replied in full crafty wise: ""However high and mighty"

3915,ENDNOTES:,"command him."""
3916,ENDNOTES:,
3917,ENDNOTES:,"King Gunther smiled when she spake thus. However oft he saw Siegfried,"
3918,ENDNOTES:,yet did he not count it to him as service.
3919,ENDNOTES:,
3920,ENDNOTES:,"She spake: ""Dear lord, for my sake help me to have Siegfried and thy"
3921,ENDNOTES:,"sister come to this land, that we may see them here. Naught liefer might"
3922,ENDNOTES:,ever hap to me in truth. Whenso I think on thy sister's courtesie and
3923,ENDNOTES:,"her well-bred mind, how it delighteth me! How we sate together, when I"
3924,ENDNOTES:,"first became thy wife! She may with honor love bold Siegfried."""
3925,ENDNOTES:,
3926,ENDNOTES:,"She besought so long, till the king did speak: ""Now know that I have"
3927,ENDNOTES:,never seen more welcome guests. Ye need but beg me gently. I will send
3928,ENDNOTES:,"my envoys for the twain, that they may come to see us to the Rhine."""
3929,ENDNOTES:,
3930,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the queen: ""Pray tell me then, when ye are willed to send for"

3936,ENDNOTES:,
3937,ENDNOTES:,He had these come before him and bade them carry tidings to Siegfried's
3938,ENDNOTES:,land. To their delight Brunhild did give them full lordly vesture.
3939,ENDNOTES:,

3950,ENDNOTES:,Brunhild and Uta and whatever ladies were found at court all commended
3951,ENDNOTES:,their service to the lovely dames and the many valiant men in
3952,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried's land. With the consent of the kinsmen of the king the
3953,ENDNOTES:,messengers set forth. They rode as wandering knights; their horses and
3954,ENDNOTES:,"their trappings had now been brought them. Then they voided the land,"
3955,ENDNOTES:,"for they had haste of the journey, whither they would fare. The king"
3956,ENDNOTES:,bade guard the messengers well with convoys. In three weeks they came
3957,ENDNOTES:,"riding into the land, to Nibelung's castle, in the marches of Norway,"
3958,ENDNOTES:,(1) whither they were sent. Here they found the knight. The mounts of
3959,ENDNOTES:,the messengers were weary from the lengthy way.
3960,ENDNOTES:,
3961,ENDNOTES:,"Both Siegfried and Kriemhild were then told that knights were come, who"
3962,ENDNOTES:,wore such clothes as men were wont to wear at Burgundy. She sprang
3963,ENDNOTES:,from a couch on which she lay to rest and bade a maiden hie her to the
3964,ENDNOTES:,"window. In the court she saw bold Gere standing, him and the fellowship"
3965,ENDNOTES:,that had been sent thither. What joyful things she there found against
3966,ENDNOTES:,"her sorrow of heart! She spake to the king: ""Now behold where they"

3971,ENDNOTES:,
3972,ENDNOTES:,All the courtiers ran to where one saw them. Each of them in turn then
3973,ENDNOTES:,"spake full kindly, as best he could to the envoys. Siegmund, the lord,"
3974,ENDNOTES:,was right blithe of their coming. Then Gere and his men were lodged and
3975,ENDNOTES:,men bade take their steeds in charge. The messengers then went hence
3976,ENDNOTES:,"to where Lord Siegfried sate by Kriemhild. This they did, for they had"
3977,ENDNOTES:,leave to go to court. The host and his lady rose from their seats at
3978,ENDNOTES:,"once and greeted well Gere of the Burgundian land with his fellowship,"

4011,ENDNOTES:,out for the guests; no longer did they tarry. Now Siegmund was come
4012,ENDNOTES:,to where he saw the messengers. The lord said to the Burgundians in
4013,ENDNOTES:,"friendly wise: ""Be welcome, Sir Knights, ye men of Gunther. Sith now"
4014,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, my son, hath won Kriemhild to wife, one should see you more"

4016,ENDNOTES:,
4017,ENDNOTES:,"They answered that they would gladly come, when so he would. Of their"

4019,ENDNOTES:,"be seated and brought them food, of which Siegfried had them given"
4020,ENDNOTES:,"great store. They must needs stay there full nine days, till at last"
4021,ENDNOTES:,"the doughty knights made plaint, that they durst not ride again to their"

4023,ENDNOTES:,
4024,ENDNOTES:,Meantime king Siegfried had sent to fetch his friends; he asked them

4032,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake his warriors: ""And ye be minded to journey to the feasting,"

4037,ENDNOTES:,"Up spake then Lord Siegmund of Netherland: ""Will ye to the feasting, why"

4046,ENDNOTES:,"Since now the noble king was minded for the journey, men bade the good"

4048,ENDNOTES:,"the Rhine, that he would full fain be at their feasting. Siegfried and"
4049,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild, as the tale doth tell, gave the messengers such store of"
4050,ENDNOTES:,gifts that their horses could not bear them to their native land. A
4051,ENDNOTES:,wealthy man was he. They drove their sturdy sumpters merrily along.
4052,ENDNOTES:,
4053,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried and Siegmund arrayed their men. Eckewart, the margrave, that"
4054,ENDNOTES:,"very hour bade seek out ladies' robes, the best that were at hand or"

4056,ENDNOTES:,saddles and the shields. To knights and ladies who should go hence with
4057,ENDNOTES:,"him was given whatso they would, so that they wanted naught. He brought"
4058,ENDNOTES:,to his kinsfolk many a lordly stranger.
4059,ENDNOTES:,
4060,ENDNOTES:,"The messengers pricked fast upon their homeward way. Now was Gere, the"

4063,ENDNOTES:,"did hie them, as people do, to ask the tidings. Quoth the good knight:"

4087,ENDNOTES:,
4088,ENDNOTES:,"""He may lightly give great gifts,"" spake then Hagen; ""he could not"

4096,ENDNOTES:,time they had to oversee the stewards and the butlers and raise many a
4097,ENDNOTES:,"bench. Ortwin helped them, too, at this, and Gunther said them thanks."

4123,ENDNOTES:,"little child, Kriemhild's son, at home. That must needs be. Great grief"
4124,ENDNOTES:,befell him through their journey to the court. The bairn never saw his

4126,ENDNOTES:,"Had he known aright how he would fare at the feasting, no whit of it"

4147,ENDNOTES:,the queen rode forth in princely wise and mickle greeting of the welcome

4149,ENDNOTES:,them as though Lady Kriemhild had not greeted Lady Brunhild so fair in

4160,ENDNOTES:,
4161,ENDNOTES:,"""Now God requite you,"" quoth Siegmund, the honor-seeking man; ""sith my"

4163,ENDNOTES:,"to see you."""
4164,ENDNOTES:,
4165,ENDNOTES:,"At this spake Gunther: ""Now hath joy happed to me thereby."""
4166,ENDNOTES:,
4167,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried was received with much great worship as beseemed him; none
4168,ENDNOTES:,bare him hatred there. Giselher and Gernot helped thereby with great
4169,ENDNOTES:,"courtesie. I ween, never have guests been greeted in such goodly wise."
4170,ENDNOTES:,
4171,ENDNOTES:,Then the wives of the two kings drew near each other. Emptied were many
4172,ENDNOTES:,"saddles, as fair ladies were lifted down by knightly hands upon the"
4173,ENDNOTES:,sward. How busy were those who gladly served the dames! The lovely women
4174,ENDNOTES:,"now drew near each other, and many a knight was blithe, that such fair"
4175,ENDNOTES:,greeting passed between the twain. Then one saw great press of warriors
4176,ENDNOTES:,standing by the high-born maids. The lordly meiny (1) grasped each
4177,ENDNOTES:,other by the hand. Much courteous bowing was seen and loving kisses from
4178,ENDNOTES:,fair-fashioned dames. This liked well Gunther's and Siegfried's liegemen
4179,ENDNOTES:,"for to see. They bided now no longer, but rode to town. The host"
4180,ENDNOTES:,bade show his guests full well that all were fain to see them in the
4181,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land. Many a royal joust took place before the high-born
4182,ENDNOTES:,"maids. Hagen of Troneg and Ortwin, too, proved full well their prowess."
4183,ENDNOTES:,One durst not leave undone whatso they would command. Much service was
4184,ENDNOTES:,rendered by them to the welcome guests. Many shields were heard resound
4185,ENDNOTES:,from thrusts and blows before the castle gate. The host and his guests
4186,ENDNOTES:,"tarried long time without, or ever they came within. Forsooth the hours"
4187,ENDNOTES:,passed quickly for them with their sports. Merrily they rode before the
4188,ENDNOTES:,royal palace. Many cunning housings (2) of good cloth and well cut
4189,ENDNOTES:,were seen hanging on either side from the saddles of the fair-fashioned
4190,ENDNOTES:,dames.
4191,ENDNOTES:,
4192,ENDNOTES:,Then came Gunther's liegemen. Men bade lead the strangers quickly to
4193,ENDNOTES:,"their easement. At times one saw Brunhild glance at Lady Kriemhild, who"
4194,ENDNOTES:,was passing fair enow. Her color against the gold gave back the gleam
4195,ENDNOTES:,in lovely wise. On every side in Worms one heard the courtiers shout.
4196,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther bade Dankwart, his marshal, have them in his care, who then"
4197,ENDNOTES:,gan lodge the retinue in goodly wise. One let them eat within and eke
4198,ENDNOTES:,without. Never were stranger guests better cared for. Men gave them
4199,ENDNOTES:,"gladly all they craved; so rich was the king, that not a wish was there"
4200,ENDNOTES:,denied. Men served them in friendly wise without all hate. The host now
4201,ENDNOTES:,took his seat at table with his guests. One bade Siegfried be seated
4202,ENDNOTES:,where he sate afore. Then many a stately man went with him to the seats.
4203,ENDNOTES:,Twelve hundred warriors in sooth did sit at his round table. Brunhild
4204,ENDNOTES:,thought her that a vassal could not be mightier than he; yet she was
4205,ENDNOTES:,still so friendly to him that she did not wish his death.
4206,ENDNOTES:,
4207,ENDNOTES:,"On an evening when the king was seated at the board, many costly robes"
4208,ENDNOTES:,"were wet with wine, as the butlers hied them to the tables. Full service"
4209,ENDNOTES:,"was given there with mickle zeal. As hath long been the wont at feasts,"
4210,ENDNOTES:,men bade the ladies and the maids be given fair lodgment. From wherever
4211,ENDNOTES:,"they were come, the host bare them right good will. One gave them all"
4212,ENDNOTES:,enow with goodly honors.
4213,ENDNOTES:,
4214,ENDNOTES:,"When the night had an end and the day appeared, many a precious stone"
4215,ENDNOTES:,"from the sumpter chests sparkled on goodly weeds, as they were touched"
4216,ENDNOTES:,by woman's hand. Many a lordly robe was taken forth. Or ever the day had
4217,ENDNOTES:,"fully dawned, many knights and squires came out before the hall. Then"
4218,ENDNOTES:,"rose a merry rout before the early mass, which was sung for the king."
4219,ENDNOTES:,There young heroes rode so well that the king did cry them mercy. Many
4220,ENDNOTES:,"a trumpet rang out passing loud, and the noise of drums and flutes did"
4221,ENDNOTES:,grow so great that the broad town of Worms reechoed with the sound. The
4222,ENDNOTES:,high-mettled heroes horsed them everywhere. Then there rose in the land
4223,ENDNOTES:,high knightly play from many a doughty champion; one saw a great rout
4224,ENDNOTES:,"of them whose youthful hearts beat high, and many a dapper knight and a"
4225,ENDNOTES:,good stood armed with shield. At the easements sate the high-born dames
4226,ENDNOTES:,"and many comely maids, decked out in brave attire. They watched the"
4227,ENDNOTES:,pastimes of the many valiant men. The host himself gan tilt there with
4228,ENDNOTES:,"his friends. Thus they passed the time, the which seemed aught but long."
4229,ENDNOTES:,
4230,ENDNOTES:,"Then from the dome was heard the sound of many bells. The palfreys came,"
4231,ENDNOTES:,the ladies rode away; but many a bold man followed the noble queens.
4232,ENDNOTES:,They alighted on the green before the minster; Brunhild was still
4233,ENDNOTES:,"friendly to her guests. Wearing crowns, they entered the spacious"
4234,ENDNOTES:,"church. Later their love was parted, which caused great hate. When they"
4235,ENDNOTES:,"had heard the mass, they rode away again with many honors and were soon"
4236,ENDNOTES:,seen going merrily to table. Their pleasure at the feasting did not flag
4237,ENDNOTES:,until the eleventh day.

4250,ENDNOTES:,"On a day before the vesper tide a great turmoil arose, which many"

4255,ENDNOTES:,
4256,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the fair Kriemhild: ""I have a husband who by right should"

4319,ENDNOTES:,
4320,ENDNOTES:,"They needed not much bidding, but sought rich robes and many a dame and"

4322,ENDNOTES:,"her train. Fair Kriemhild, too, was well arrayed and three and forty"
4323,ENDNOTES:,"maidens with her, whom she had brought hither to the Rhine. They wore"
4324,ENDNOTES:,"bright vesture wrought in Araby, and thus the fair-fashioned maids"
4325,ENDNOTES:,betook them to the minster. All Siegfried's men awaited them before the
4326,ENDNOTES:,house. The folk had marvel whence it chanced that the queens were seen
4327,ENDNOTES:,"thus sundered, so that they did not walk together as afore. From this"
4328,ENDNOTES:,did many a warrior later suffer dire distress. Here before the minster
4329,ENDNOTES:,"stood Gunther's wife, while many a good knight had pastime with the"
4330,ENDNOTES:,comely dames whom they there espied.
4331,ENDNOTES:,
4332,ENDNOTES:,Then came the Lady Kriemhild with a large and noble train. Whatever kind
4333,ENDNOTES:,"of clothes the daughters of noble knights have ever worn, these were but"
4334,ENDNOTES:,"the wind against her retinue. She was so rich in goods, that what the"
4335,ENDNOTES:,"wives of thirty kings could not purvey, that Kriemhild did. An' one"
4336,ENDNOTES:,"would wish to, yet he could not aver that men had ever seen such costly"
4337,ENDNOTES:,dresses as at this time her fair-fashioned maidens wore. Kriemhild
4338,ENDNOTES:,"had not done it, save to anger Brunhild. They met before the spacious"
4339,ENDNOTES:,minster. Through her great hate the mistress of the house in evil wise
4340,ENDNOTES:,"bade Kriemhild stand: ""Forsooth no vassaless should ever walk before the"
4341,ENDNOTES:,"queen."""
4342,ENDNOTES:,
4343,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake fair Kriemhild (angry was her mood): ""Couldst thou have held"
4344,ENDNOTES:,"thy peace, 'twere well for thee. Thou hast disgraced thee and the fair"
4345,ENDNOTES:,body of thine. How might a vassal's leman (1) ever be the wife of any

4348,ENDNOTES:,"""Whom callest thou here leman?"" spake the queen."

4351,ENDNOTES:,"by Siegfried, my dear husband. Certes, it was not my brother who won thy"
4352,ENDNOTES:,maidhood. Whither could thy wits have wandered? It was an evil trick.

4355,ENDNOTES:,
4356,ENDNOTES:,"""I' faith,"" spake then Brunhild, ""Gunther shall hear of this."""
4357,ENDNOTES:,
4358,ENDNOTES:,"""What is that to me?"" said Kriemhild. ""Thy pride hath bewrayed thee."
4359,ENDNOTES:,"With words thou hast claimed me for thy service. Know, by my troth, it"
4360,ENDNOTES:,"will ever grieve me, for I shall be no more thy faithful friend."""
4361,ENDNOTES:,
4362,ENDNOTES:,"Then Brunhild wept. Kriemhild delayed no longer, but entered the minster"
4363,ENDNOTES:,"with her train before the queen. Thus there rose great hatred, from"
4364,ENDNOTES:,which bright eyes grew dim and moist.
4365,ENDNOTES:,
4366,ENDNOTES:,"Whatso men did or sang to God's service there, the time seemed far"
4367,ENDNOTES:,"too long for Brunhild, for she was sad of heart and mood. Many a brave"
4368,ENDNOTES:,knight and a good must later rue this day. Brunhild with her ladies now
4369,ENDNOTES:,"went forth and stopped before the minster. Her-thought: ""Kriemhild must"

4373,ENDNOTES:,Now the noble Kriemhild came with many a valiant liegeman. Lady Brunhild

4376,ENDNOTES:,
4377,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: ""Ye should have let me pass. I'll prove"

4380,ENDNOTES:,
4381,ENDNOTES:,"Brunhild had never seen so ill a day. She spake: ""This costly hoop of"

4384,ENDNOTES:,
4385,ENDNOTES:,Both ladies now had fallen into grievous wrath.
4386,ENDNOTES:,
4387,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild replied: ""I'll not be called a thief. Thou hadst done better"
4388,ENDNOTES:,"to have held thy peace, an' thou hold thine honor dear. I'll prove it"
4389,ENDNOTES:,"by the girdle which I wear about my waist, that I lie not. Certes, my"

4391,ENDNOTES:,
4392,ENDNOTES:,"She wore the cord of silk of Nineveh, set with precious stones; in sooth"

4395,ENDNOTES:,
4396,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the queen: ""Bid the prince of the Rhineland come hither. I"

4399,ENDNOTES:,
4400,ENDNOTES:,"The king came with knights, and when he saw his love a-weeping, how"

4446,ENDNOTES:,
4447,ENDNOTES:,"Many fair ladies were parted by the speech. Brunhild mourned so sore,"
4448,ENDNOTES:,that it moved King Gunther's men to pity. Then came Hagen of Troneg to
4449,ENDNOTES:,"his sovran lady. He found her weeping, and asked what grief she had."
4450,ENDNOTES:,She told him then the tale. On the spot he vowed that Kriemhild's lord
4451,ENDNOTES:,"should rue it sore, or he would nevermore be glad. Ortwin and Gernot"
4452,ENDNOTES:,joined their parley and these heroes counseled Siegfried's death.
4453,ENDNOTES:,"Giselher, the son of the noble Uta, came hither too. When he heard the"
4454,ENDNOTES:,"talk, he spake full true: ""Ye trusty knights, wherefore do ye this?"

4506,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE XV. How Siegfried Was Betrayed.
4507,ENDNOTES:,
4508,ENDNOTES:,Upon the fourth morning two and thirty men were seen to ride to court
4509,ENDNOTES:,and the tale was brought to mighty Gunther that war had been declared.
4510,ENDNOTES:,The very direst woes befell fair women from a lie. They gained leave
4511,ENDNOTES:,"to come before the king and say that they were Liudeger's men, whom"
4512,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried's hand had conquered afore and had brought as hostages to
4513,ENDNOTES:,Gunther's land. He greeted then the messengers and bade them go and seat
4514,ENDNOTES:,"them. One among them spake: ""My lord, pray let us stand till we have"
4515,ENDNOTES:,"told the message we do bear you. This know, ye have of a truth many"
4516,ENDNOTES:,"a mother's son as foe. Liudegast and Liudeger, whom ye one time gave"
4517,ENDNOTES:,"grievous sores, declare a feud against you and are minded to ride with"
4518,ENDNOTES:,"an army to this land."" The king waxed wroth when he heard This tale."
4519,ENDNOTES:,
4520,ENDNOTES:,"Men bade lead the perjurers to their lodgings. How might Siegfried, or"
4521,ENDNOTES:,"any else against whom they plotted, ware himself against their wiles?"
4522,ENDNOTES:,This later brought great sorrow to them all. The king walked whispering
4523,ENDNOTES:,with his friends; Hagen of Troneg never let him rest. Enow of the king's
4524,ENDNOTES:,"liegemen would fain have parted the strife, but Hagen would not give"
4525,ENDNOTES:,up his plan. On a day Siegfried found them whispering. The hero of
4526,ENDNOTES:,"Netherland gan ask: ""How go the king and his men so sadly? I'll help"
4527,ENDNOTES:,"avenge it, hath any done you aught."""
4528,ENDNOTES:,
4529,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake King Gunther: ""I am rightly sad. Liudegast and Liudeger have"
4530,ENDNOTES:,"challenged me to war; they are minded to ride openly into my land."""
4531,ENDNOTES:,
4532,ENDNOTES:,"At this the bold knight said: ""Siegfried's hand shall hinder that with"
4533,ENDNOTES:,"zeal, as beseemeth all your honors. I'll do yet to these knights as I"
4534,ENDNOTES:,"did before; I'll lay waste their lands, or ever I turn again. Be my head"
4535,ENDNOTES:,your pledge of this. Ye and your warriors shall stay at home and let me
4536,ENDNOTES:,ride to meet them with those I have. I'll let you see how fain I serve
4537,ENDNOTES:,"you. This know, through me it shall go evil with your foes."""
4538,ENDNOTES:,
4539,ENDNOTES:,"""Well is me of these tidings,"" spake then the king, as though he were"
4540,ENDNOTES:,glad in earnest of this aid. With guile the faithless man bowed low.
4541,ENDNOTES:,
4542,ENDNOTES:,"Quoth Lord Siegfried: ""Ye shall have small care."""
4543,ENDNOTES:,
4544,ENDNOTES:,Then they made ready for the journey hence with the men-at-arms. This
4545,ENDNOTES:,"was done for Siegfried and his men to see. He, too, bade those of"
4546,ENDNOTES:,Netherland get them ready. Siegfried's warriors sought out warlike
4547,ENDNOTES:,"weeds. Then the stalwart Siegfried spake: ""My father Siegmund, ye must"
4548,ENDNOTES:,"stay here. We shall return in short space hither to the Rhine, and God"
4549,ENDNOTES:,"give us luck. Ye must here make merry with the king."""
4550,ENDNOTES:,
4551,ENDNOTES:,"They tied fast their banners, as though they would away, and there were"
4552,ENDNOTES:,enow of Gunther's men who wist not wherefore this was done. Great rout
4553,ENDNOTES:,of men was seen at Siegfried's side. They bound their helmets and their
4554,ENDNOTES:,"breastplates upon the steeds, and many a stout knight made ready to"
4555,ENDNOTES:,quit the land. Then Hagen of Troneg went to find Kriemhild and asked for
4556,ENDNOTES:,leave; sith they would void the land.
4557,ENDNOTES:,
4558,ENDNOTES:,"""Now well is me,"" spake Kriemhild, ""that I have won a husband who dare"
4559,ENDNOTES:,"protect so well my loving kinsfolk, as my Lord Siegfried doth here."
4560,ENDNOTES:,"Therefore,"" spake the queen, ""will I be glad of heart. Dear friend"
4561,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen, think on that, that I do serve you gladly and never yet did bear"
4562,ENDNOTES:,"you hate. Requite this now to me in my dear husband. Let him not suffer,"
4563,ENDNOTES:,"if I have done to Brunhild aught. I since have rued it,"" spake the noble"
4564,ENDNOTES:,"wife. ""Moreover, he since hath beaten me black and blue; the brave hero"

4566,ENDNOTES:,
4567,ENDNOTES:,"""Ye'll be friends once more after some days. Kriemhild, dear lady, pray"

4569,ENDNOTES:,"this for you than for any else."""
4570,ENDNOTES:,
4571,ENDNOTES:,"""I should be without all fear,"" quoth the noble dame, ""that any one"
4572,ENDNOTES:,"would take his life in the fray, if he would not follow his overweening"
4573,ENDNOTES:,"mood; then the bold knight and a good were safe."""
4574,ENDNOTES:,
4575,ENDNOTES:,"""Lady,"" spake then Hagen, ""an' ye do think that men might wound him,"
4576,ENDNOTES:,"pray let me know with what manner of arts I can prevent this. On foot,"
4577,ENDNOTES:,"on horse, will I ever be his guard."""
4578,ENDNOTES:,
4579,ENDNOTES:,"She spake: ""Thou art my kinsman and I am thine. I'll commend to thee"
4580,ENDNOTES:,"trustingly the dear lover of mine, that thou mayst guard him well,"
4581,ENDNOTES:,"mine own dear husband."" She made him acquaint with tales which had been"
4582,ENDNOTES:,"better left unsaid. She spake: ""My husband is brave and strong enow."
4583,ENDNOTES:,"When he slew the dragon on the hill, the lusty warrior bathed him of"
4584,ENDNOTES:,"a truth in the blood, so that since then no weapon ever cut him in"
4585,ENDNOTES:,"the fray. Yet am I in fear, whenever he standeth in the fight and many"
4586,ENDNOTES:,"javelins are cast by heroes' hands, that I may lose this dear husband of"
4587,ENDNOTES:,"mine. Alas, how oft I suffer sore for Siegfried's sake! Dear kinsman, in"
4588,ENDNOTES:,"the hope that thou wilt hold thy troth with me, I'll tell thee where"
4589,ENDNOTES:,"men may wound the dear lord of mine. I let thee hear this, 'tis done in"
4590,ENDNOTES:,faith. When the hot blood gushed from the dragon's wounds and the bold
4591,ENDNOTES:,"hero and a good bathed him therein, a broad linden leaf did fall betwixt"
4592,ENDNOTES:,his shoulder blades. Therefore am I sore afraid that men may cut him
4593,ENDNOTES:,"there."""
4594,ENDNOTES:,
4595,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Hagen of Troneg: ""Sew a small mark upon his coat, whereby I"
4596,ENDNOTES:,"may know where I must guard him, when we stand in battle."""
4597,ENDNOTES:,
4598,ENDNOTES:,"She weened to save her knight, but 'twas done unto his death. She spake:"
4599,ENDNOTES:,"""With fine silk I'll sew a secret cross upon his vesture. There, knight,"
4600,ENDNOTES:,"thy hand must guard my husband, when the strife is on and he standeth in"
4601,ENDNOTES:,"the battle before his foes."""
4602,ENDNOTES:,
4603,ENDNOTES:,"""That will I well, dear my lady,"" Hagen then replied."
4604,ENDNOTES:,
4605,ENDNOTES:,"The lady weened that it would boot him aught, but Kriemhild's husband"
4606,ENDNOTES:,was thereby betrayed. Hagen then took leave; merrily he hied him hence.
4607,ENDNOTES:,The king's liegeman was blithe of mood. I ween that nevermore will
4608,ENDNOTES:,"warrior give such false counsel, as was done by him when Kriemhild"
4609,ENDNOTES:,trusted in his troth.
4610,ENDNOTES:,
4611,ENDNOTES:,Next morning Siegfried with a thousand of his men rode merrily forth. He
4612,ENDNOTES:,weened he should avenge the grievance of his kinsmen. Hagen rode so
4613,ENDNOTES:,"near him that he could eye his clothes. When he saw the sign, he sent"
4614,ENDNOTES:,"in secret twain of his men, who should tell another tale: that Gunther's"
4615,ENDNOTES:,land should still have peace and that Liudeger had sent them to the
4616,ENDNOTES:,"king. How loth Siegfried now rode home again, or ever he had avenged his"
4617,ENDNOTES:,kinsmen's wrongs! Gunther's men could hardly turn him back. He rode then
4618,ENDNOTES:,"to the king; the host gan thank him. ""Now God requite you of your will,"
4619,ENDNOTES:,"friend Siegfried, that ye do so willingly what I bid you. For this"
4620,ENDNOTES:,"I'll ever serve you, as I rightly should. I trust you more than all my"
4621,ENDNOTES:,"friends. Now that we be rid of this foray, I am minded to ride a-hunting"
4622,ENDNOTES:,"for bears and boars to the Vosges forest, as I have done oft-time."" That"
4623,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen, the faithless knight, had counseled. ""Let it be told to all my"
4624,ENDNOTES:,"guests, that we ride betimes. Those that would hunt with me must make"
4625,ENDNOTES:,"them ready. If any choose to stay at home to court the ladies, that"
4626,ENDNOTES:,"liketh me as well."""
4627,ENDNOTES:,
4628,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Sir Siegfried in lordly wise: ""And ye would a-hunting, I'd"
4629,ENDNOTES:,"fain go with you. Pray lend me a huntsman and some brach, (1) and I will"
4630,ENDNOTES:,"ride to the pines."""
4631,ENDNOTES:,
4632,ENDNOTES:,"""Will ye have but one?"" spake the king anon. ""I'll lend you, an' ye"
4633,ENDNOTES:,"will, four men to whom both wood and paths be known where the game is"
4634,ENDNOTES:,"wont to go, and who will not let you miss the camp."""
4635,ENDNOTES:,
4636,ENDNOTES:,"Then rode the full lusty warrior to his wife, whilst Hagen quickly told"
4637,ENDNOTES:,the king how he thought to trap the doughty knight. A man should never
4638,ENDNOTES:,use such faithlessness.

4648,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE XVI. How Siegfried Was Slain.
4649,ENDNOTES:,
4650,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther and Hagen, the passing bold knights, faithlessly let cry"
4651,ENDNOTES:,"a-hunting in the woods, that with sharp spears they would hunt boars"
4652,ENDNOTES:,and bears and bison. What might be braver? With them rode Siegfried
4653,ENDNOTES:,in lordly guise; many kinds of victual did they take along. At a cool
4654,ENDNOTES:,"spring he later lost his life, the which Brunhild, King Gunther's wife,"
4655,ENDNOTES:,had counseled. The bold knight then went to where he found Kriemhild.
4656,ENDNOTES:,His costly hunting garb and those of his fellowship were already bound
4657,ENDNOTES:,"upon the sumpters, for they would cross the Rhine. Never could Kriemhild"
4658,ENDNOTES:,"have been more sorrowful. He kissed his love upon her mouth. ""God let"
4659,ENDNOTES:,"me see thee, lady, still in health and grant that thine eyes may see me"
4660,ENDNOTES:,too. Thou shalt have pastime with thy loving kinsmen. I may not stay at
4661,ENDNOTES:,"home."""
4662,ENDNOTES:,
4663,ENDNOTES:,"Then she thought of the tale she had told to Hagen, though she durst not"
4664,ENDNOTES:,say a whit. The noble queen began to rue that she was ever born. Lord
4665,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried's wife wept out of measure. She spake to the knight: ""Let be"
4666,ENDNOTES:,"your hunting. I had an evil dream last night, how two wild boars did"
4667,ENDNOTES:,chase you across the heath; then flowers grew red. I have in truth great
4668,ENDNOTES:,cause to weep so sore. I be much adread of sundry plans and whether we
4669,ENDNOTES:,"have not misserved some who might bear us hostile hate. Tarry here, dear"
4670,ENDNOTES:,"my lord, that I counsel by my troth."""
4671,ENDNOTES:,
4672,ENDNOTES:,"He spake: ""Dear love, I'll come back in a few short days. I wot not here"
4673,ENDNOTES:,of people who bear me aught of hate. Each and all of thy kinsmen be my
4674,ENDNOTES:,"friends, nor have I deserved it other of the knights."""
4675,ENDNOTES:,
4676,ENDNOTES:,"""No, no, Sir Siegfried, in truth I fear thy fall. I had last night an"
4677,ENDNOTES:,"evil dream, how two mountains fell upon thee. I saw thee nevermore. It"
4678,ENDNOTES:,"doth cut me to the heart, that thou wilt part from me."""
4679,ENDNOTES:,
4680,ENDNOTES:,In his arms he clasped his courteous wife and kissed her tenderly. Then
4681,ENDNOTES:,"in a short space he took his leave and parted hence. Alas, she never saw"
4682,ENDNOTES:,him in health again.
4683,ENDNOTES:,
4684,ENDNOTES:,Then they rode from thence into a deep wood for pastime's sake. Many
4685,ENDNOTES:,"bold knights did follow Gunther and his men, but Gernot and Giselher"
4686,ENDNOTES:,stayed at home. Many laden sumpters were sent before them across the
4687,ENDNOTES:,"Rhine, the which bare for the hunting fellowship bread and wine, meat"
4688,ENDNOTES:,"and fish, and great store of other things, which so mighty a king might"
4689,ENDNOTES:,rightly have. They bade the proud huntsmen and bold halt before a green
4690,ENDNOTES:,"wood over against the courses of the game, upon a passing broad glade"
4691,ENDNOTES:,"where they should hunt. The king was told that Siegfried, too, was come."
4692,ENDNOTES:,The hunting fellowship now took their stand on every side. Then the
4693,ENDNOTES:,"bold knight, the sturdy Siegfried, asked: ""Ye heroes bold and brave, who"
4694,ENDNOTES:,"shall lead us to the game within the wood?"""
4695,ENDNOTES:,
4696,ENDNOTES:,"""Let us part,"" spake Hagen, ""ere we begin the chase. Thereby my lords"
4697,ENDNOTES:,and I may know who be the best hunter on this woodland journey. Let us
4698,ENDNOTES:,divide the folk and hounds and let each turn whithersoever he list. He
4699,ENDNOTES:,"who doth hunt the best shall have our thanks."" Short time the huntsmen"
4700,ENDNOTES:,bided by another after that.
4701,ENDNOTES:,
4702,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Lord Siegfried: ""I need no dogs save one brach that hath"
4703,ENDNOTES:,been trained that he can tell the track of the beasts through the pine
4704,ENDNOTES:,"woods."" Quoth Kriemhild's husband: ""We'll find the game."""
4705,ENDNOTES:,
4706,ENDNOTES:,Then an old huntsman took a good sleuth-hound and in a short space
4707,ENDNOTES:,brought the lord to where many beasts were found. Whatso rose from its
4708,ENDNOTES:,lair the comrades hunted as good hunters still are wont to do. Whatever
4709,ENDNOTES:,"the brach started, bold Siegfried, the hero of Netherland, slew with his"
4710,ENDNOTES:,hand. His horse did run so hard that none escaped him. In the chase he
4711,ENDNOTES:,gained the prize above them all. Doughty enow he was in all things. The
4712,ENDNOTES:,"beast which he slew with his hands was the first, a mighty boar; after"
4713,ENDNOTES:,which he found full soon a monstrous lion. (1) When the brach started
4714,ENDNOTES:,"this from its lair, he shot it with his bow, in which he had placed a"
4715,ENDNOTES:,full sharp arrow. After the shot the lion ran the space of but three
4716,ENDNOTES:,bounds. The hunting fellowship gave Siegfried thanks. Thereafter he
4717,ENDNOTES:,"speedily slew a bison and an elk, four strong ure-oxen, (2) and a savage"
4718,ENDNOTES:,"shelk. (3) His horse bare him so swiftly that naught escaped him, nor"
4719,ENDNOTES:,could hart or hind avoid him. Then the sleuth-hound found a mighty boar;
4720,ENDNOTES:,"when he began to flee, at once there came the master of the hunt and"
4721,ENDNOTES:,encountered him upon his path. Wrathfully the boar did run against the
4722,ENDNOTES:,"valiant hero, but Kriemhild's husband slew him with his sword. Another"
4723,ENDNOTES:,huntsman might not have done this deed so lightly. When he had felled
4724,ENDNOTES:,"him, they leashed the sleuth-hound; his rich booty was soon well known"
4725,ENDNOTES:,to the Burgundian men.
4726,ENDNOTES:,
4727,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake his huntsman: ""Sir Siegfried, if might so be, let us leave a"
4728,ENDNOTES:,"deal of the beasts alive. Ye'll empty both our hill and woods to-day."""
4729,ENDNOTES:,
4730,ENDNOTES:,At this the brave knight and a bold gan smile. Then the calls of men and
4731,ENDNOTES:,the baying of hounds were heard on every side; so great was the noise
4732,ENDNOTES:,that both hill and pine woods echoed with the sound. The huntsmen had
4733,ENDNOTES:,let loose full four and twenty packs. Then passing many beasts must
4734,ENDNOTES:,needs lose their lives. Each man weened to bring it to pass that men
4735,ENDNOTES:,"should give him the prize of the hunt; that might not be, for the"
4736,ENDNOTES:,"stalwart Siegfried was already standing by the fire. The chase was over,"
4737,ENDNOTES:,and yet not quite. Those who would to the camp-fire brought with them
4738,ENDNOTES:,"thither hides of many beasts and game in plenty. Ho, how much the king's"
4739,ENDNOTES:,meiny bare then to the kitchen!
4740,ENDNOTES:,
4741,ENDNOTES:,Then bade the king announce to the huntsman that he would dismount. A
4742,ENDNOTES:,"horn was blown full loud just once, that all might know that one might"
4743,ENDNOTES:,find the noble prince in camp. Spake then one of Siegfried's huntsmen:
4744,ENDNOTES:,"""My lord, I heard by the blast of a horn that we must now hie us to the"
4745,ENDNOTES:,"quarters; I'll now give answer."""
4746,ENDNOTES:,
4747,ENDNOTES:,Thus by many blasts of horns they asked about the hunters. Then spake
4748,ENDNOTES:,"Sir Siegfried: ""Now let us leave the pine wood!"" His steed bare him"
4749,ENDNOTES:,smoothly and with him they hasted hence. With their rout they started
4750,ENDNOTES:,up a savage beast; a wild bear it was. Quoth then the knight to those
4751,ENDNOTES:,"behind: ""I'll give our fellowship a little pastime. Let loose the brach."
4752,ENDNOTES:,Forsooth I spy a bear which shall journey with us to the camp. Flee he
4753,ENDNOTES:,"never so fast, he shall not escape us."""
4754,ENDNOTES:,
4755,ENDNOTES:,"The brach was loosed, the bear sprang hence; Kriemhild's husband would"
4756,ENDNOTES:,"fain overtake him. He reached a thicket, where none could follow. The"
4757,ENDNOTES:,"mighty beast weened now to escape from the hunter with his life, but the"
4758,ENDNOTES:,proud knight and a good leaped from his steed and began to chase him.
4759,ENDNOTES:,The bear was helpless and could not flee away. At once the hero caught
4760,ENDNOTES:,"it and bound it quickly with not a wound, so that it might neither"
4761,ENDNOTES:,scratch nor bite the men. The doughty knight then tied it to his saddle
4762,ENDNOTES:,and horsed him quickly. Through his overweening mood the bold warrior
4763,ENDNOTES:,and a good brought it to the camp-fire as a pastime. In what lordly wise
4764,ENDNOTES:,"he rode to the quarters! Mickle was his boar-spear, strong and broad. A"
4765,ENDNOTES:,dainty sword hung downward to his spurs. The lord bare also a fair horn
4766,ENDNOTES:,of ruddy gold. Never heard I tale of better hunting weeds. One saw him
4767,ENDNOTES:,wear a coat of black and silky cloth and a hat of sable: rich enow it
4768,ENDNOTES:,"was. Ho, what costly bands he wore upon his quiver! A panther's skin was"
4769,ENDNOTES:,"drawn over it for its sweet fragrance' (4) sake. He bare a bow, which"
4770,ENDNOTES:,"any but the hero must needs draw back with a windlass, and he would bend"
4771,ENDNOTES:,it. His vesture was befurred with otter skin (5) from head to toe. From
4772,ENDNOTES:,the bright fur shone out on both sides of the bold master of the hunt
4773,ENDNOTES:,"many a bar of gold. Balmung (6) he also bare, a good broad sword, that"
4774,ENDNOTES:,was so sharp that it never failed when 'twas wielded 'gainst a helmet;
4775,ENDNOTES:,its edge was good. In high spirits was the lordly huntsman. Sith I must
4776,ENDNOTES:,"tell you all the tale, his costly quiver was full of goodly darts, the"
4777,ENDNOTES:,"heads a full hand's breadth, on golden shafts. What he pierced therewith"
4778,ENDNOTES:,must needs die soon.
4779,ENDNOTES:,
4780,ENDNOTES:,Thus the noble knight rode hence in hunter's garb. Gunther's men espied
4781,ENDNOTES:,him coming and ran out to meet him and took his horse in charge. On his
4782,ENDNOTES:,"saddle he carried a large bear and a strong. When he had dismounted, he"
4783,ENDNOTES:,"loosed the bonds from feet and snout. Those of the pack bayed loudly,"
4784,ENDNOTES:,that spied the bear. The beast would to the woods; the serving folk had
4785,ENDNOTES:,"fear. Dazed by the din, the bear made for the kitchen. Ho, how he"
4786,ENDNOTES:,drove the scullions from the fire! Many a kettle was upset and many a
4787,ENDNOTES:,"firebrand scattered. Ho, what good victual men found lying in the ashes!"
4788,ENDNOTES:,Then the lordings and their liegemen sprang from their scats. The bear
4789,ENDNOTES:,grew furious and the king bade loose the pack that lay enleashed. Had
4790,ENDNOTES:,"all sped well, they would have had a merry day. No longer the doughty"
4791,ENDNOTES:,"men delayed, but ran for the bear with bows and pikes. There was such"
4792,ENDNOTES:,"press of dogs that none might shoot, but from the people's shouts the"
4793,ENDNOTES:,whole hill rang. The bear began to flee before the dogs; none could
4794,ENDNOTES:,"follow him but Kriemhild's husband, who caught and slew him with his"
4795,ENDNOTES:,"sword. Then they bore the bear again to the fire. Those that saw it,"
4796,ENDNOTES:,averred he was a mighty man.
4797,ENDNOTES:,
4798,ENDNOTES:,Men bade now the proud hunting fellowship seat them at the tables. Upon
4799,ENDNOTES:,"a fair mead there sate a goodly company. Ho, what rich viands they"
4800,ENDNOTES:,bare there to the noble huntsmen! The butlers who should bring the wine
4801,ENDNOTES:,delayed; else might never heroes have been better served. Had they not
4802,ENDNOTES:,"been so falsely minded, then had the knights been free of every blame."
4803,ENDNOTES:,
4804,ENDNOTES:,"Now the Lord Siegfried spake: ""Me-wondereth, since men do give us such"
4805,ENDNOTES:,"great store from the kitchen, why the butlers bring us not the"
4806,ENDNOTES:,"wine. Unless men purvey the hunters better, I'll be no more your"
4807,ENDNOTES:,"hunting-fellow. I have well deserved that they regard me, too."""
4808,ENDNOTES:,
4809,ENDNOTES:,"The king addressed him from his seat with guile: ""We fain would do you"
4810,ENDNOTES:,"remedy of what we lack. It is Hagen's fault, who is willed to let us die"
4811,ENDNOTES:,"of thirst."""
4812,ENDNOTES:,
4813,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Hagen: ""Dear my lord, I weened that the hunt should be in the"
4814,ENDNOTES:,"Spessart (7) wood, therefore sent I thither the wine. Though we may not"
4815,ENDNOTES:,"drink to-day, how well will I avoid this in the future!"""
4816,ENDNOTES:,

4824,ENDNOTES:,
4825,ENDNOTES:,To the danger of many a knight was this counsel given. The pangs of
4826,ENDNOTES:,thirst now plagued the warrior Siegfried. He bade the tables be borne
4827,ENDNOTES:,"away the sooner, for he would go to the spring in the mountains. With"
4828,ENDNOTES:,false intent the counsel was then given by the knights. They bade the
4829,ENDNOTES:,"game which Siegfried's hand had slain, be carried home on wains. Whoever"
4830,ENDNOTES:,saw it gave him great laud. Hagen of Troneg now foully broke his troth
4831,ENDNOTES:,"to Siegfried. When they would hence to the broad linden, he spake: ""It"

4838,ENDNOTES:,
4839,ENDNOTES:,"""So let us try it then,"" quoth Hagen, the knight."
4840,ENDNOTES:,
4841,ENDNOTES:,"Spake the sturdy Siegfried: ""Then will I lay me down on the green sward"
4842,ENDNOTES:,"at your feet."" (9)"
4843,ENDNOTES:,
4844,ENDNOTES:,"How lief it was to Gunther, when he heard these words! Then the bold"
4845,ENDNOTES:,"knight spake again: ""I'll tell you more. I'll take with me all my"
4846,ENDNOTES:,"trappings, my spear and shield and all my hunting garb."" Around him he"
4847,ENDNOTES:,quickly girded his quiver and his sword.
4848,ENDNOTES:,
4849,ENDNOTES:,Then they drew the clothes from off their limbs; men saw them stand in
4850,ENDNOTES:,"two white shifts. Like two wild panthers through the clover they ran,"
4851,ENDNOTES:,but men spied bold Siegfried first at the spring. In all things he bare
4852,ENDNOTES:,away the prize from many a man. Quickly he ungirt his sword and laid
4853,ENDNOTES:,aside his quiver and leaned the stout spear against a linden bough.
4854,ENDNOTES:,The lordly stranger stood now by the flowing spring. Passing great was
4855,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried's courtesie. He laid down his shield where the spring gushed
4856,ENDNOTES:,"forth, but the hero drank not, albeit he thirsted sore until the king"
4857,ENDNOTES:,"had drunk, who gave him evil thanks. Cool, clear, and good was the"
4858,ENDNOTES:,"spring. Gunther stooped down then to the flowing stream, and when he had"
4859,ENDNOTES:,drunken straightened up again. Bold Siegfried would fain also have done
4860,ENDNOTES:,"the same, but now he paid for his courtesie. Hagen bare quite away from"
4861,ENDNOTES:,him both bow and sword and bounded then to where he found the spear;
4862,ENDNOTES:,then he looked for the mark on bold Siegfried's coat. As Lord Siegfried
4863,ENDNOTES:,"drank above the spring, he pierced him through the cross, so that"
4864,ENDNOTES:,his heart's blood spurted from the wounds almost on Hagen's clothes.
4865,ENDNOTES:,Nevermore will hero do so foul a deed. Hagen left the spear a-sticking
4866,ENDNOTES:,in his heart and fled more madly than he ever in the world had run from
4867,ENDNOTES:,any man.
4868,ENDNOTES:,
4869,ENDNOTES:,"When Lord Siegfried felt the mighty wound, up from the spring he started"
4870,ENDNOTES:,in a rage. From betwixt his shoulder blades a long spear-shaft towered.
4871,ENDNOTES:,"He weened to find his bow or his sword, and then had Hagen been repaid"
4872,ENDNOTES:,as he deserved. But when the sorely wounded hero found no trace of his
4873,ENDNOTES:,"sword, then had he naught else but his shield. This he snatched from the"
4874,ENDNOTES:,spring and ran at Hagen; nor could King Gunther's man escape him. Albeit
4875,ENDNOTES:,"he was wounded unto death, yet he smote so mightily that a plenty of"
4876,ENDNOTES:,precious stones were shaken from the shield. The shield itself burst
4877,ENDNOTES:,quite apart. Fain would the lordly stranger have avenged him. Now was
4878,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen fallen to the ground at his hands, and from the force of the blow"
4879,ENDNOTES:,"the glade rang loudly. Had he had a sword in hand, then had it been"
4880,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen's death, so sore enraged was the wounded man. Forsooth he had good"
4881,ENDNOTES:,"cause thereof. His hue grew pale, he could not stand; his strength of"
4882,ENDNOTES:,"body melted quite away, for in bright colors he bore the signs of death."
4883,ENDNOTES:,Thereafter he was bewailed by fair dames enow.
4884,ENDNOTES:,
4885,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild's husband fell now among the flowers. Fast from his wounds his
4886,ENDNOTES:,"blood was seen to gush. He began to rail, as indeed he had great cause,"
4887,ENDNOTES:,at those who had planned this treacherous death. The deadly wounded
4888,ENDNOTES:,"spake: ""Forsooth, ye evil cowards, what avail my services now that ye"
4889,ENDNOTES:,have slain me? This is my reward that I was always faithful to you.
4890,ENDNOTES:,"Alas, ye have acted ill against your kinsmen. Those of them who are born"
4891,ENDNOTES:,in after days will be disgraced. Ye have avenged your wrath too sore
4892,ENDNOTES:,"upon me. With shame shall ye be parted from all good warriors."""
4893,ENDNOTES:,
4894,ENDNOTES:,The knights all ran to where he lay slain. For enow of them it was a
4895,ENDNOTES:,"hapless day. He was bewailed by those who had aught of loyalty, and"
4896,ENDNOTES:,this the brave and lusty knight had well deserved. The king of the
4897,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundians bemoaned his death. Quoth the deadly wounded: ""There is no"
4898,ENDNOTES:,need that he should weep who hath done the damage; he doth merit mickle
4899,ENDNOTES:,"blame. It had been better left undone."""
4900,ENDNOTES:,
4901,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the fierce Hagen: ""Forsooth I wot not what ye now bewail. All"
4902,ENDNOTES:,our fear and all our woe have now an end. We shall find scant few who
4903,ENDNOTES:,"dare withstand us now. Well is me, that to his rule I have put an end."""
4904,ENDNOTES:,
4905,ENDNOTES:,"""Ye may lightly boast you,"" Siegfried then replied. ""Had I wist your"
4906,ENDNOTES:,"murderous bent, I had well guarded my life against you. None doth rue"
4907,ENDNOTES:,"me so sore as Lady Kriemhild, my wife. Now may God have pity that I"
4908,ENDNOTES:,"ever had a son to whom the reproach will be made in after days, that his"
4909,ENDNOTES:,"kindred have slain a man with murderous intent. If I might,"" so spake"
4910,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried, ""I should rightly make complaint of this."" Piteously the"
4911,ENDNOTES:,"deadly wounded spake again: ""Noble king, if ye will keep your troth to"
4912,ENDNOTES:,"any in the world, then let my dear love be commended to your grace and"
4913,ENDNOTES:,let it avail her that she be your sister. For the sake of your princely

4977,ENDNOTES:,Lady Kriemhild learned the baneful tale. As she would set out with her
4978,ENDNOTES:,"ladies for the minster, the chamberlain spake: ""Pray stay your feet,"

5157,ENDNOTES:,
5158,ENDNOTES:,The people of the town returned now to their lodgings. She begged the
5159,ENDNOTES:,"priests and monks and all his retinue, that served the knight, to stay."
5160,ENDNOTES:,They spent full evil nights and toilsome days; many a man remained
5161,ENDNOTES:,"without all food and drink. For those who would partake, it was made"
5162,ENDNOTES:,known that men would give them to the full. This Sir Siegmund purveyed.
5163,ENDNOTES:,Then were the Nibelungs made acquaint with mickle toil. During the three
5164,ENDNOTES:,"days, as we hear tell, those who knew how to sing, were made to bear a"
5165,ENDNOTES:,"deal of work. What offerings men brought them! Those who were very poor,"
5166,ENDNOTES:,"grew rich enow. Whatever of poor men there were, the which had naught,"
5167,ENDNOTES:,these were bid go to mass with gold from Siegfried's treasure chamber.
5168,ENDNOTES:,"Since he might not live, many thousand marks of gold were given for his"
5169,ENDNOTES:,"soul. She dealt out well-tilled lands, wherever cloisters and pious folk"
5170,ENDNOTES:,were found. Enow of gold and silver was given to the poor. By her deeds
5171,ENDNOTES:,she showed that she did love him fondly.
5172,ENDNOTES:,
5173,ENDNOTES:,"Upon the third morning at time of mass, the broad churchyard by the"
5174,ENDNOTES:,"minster was full of weeping country folk. They served him after death,"
5175,ENDNOTES:,"as one should do to loving kin. In the four days, as hath been told,"
5176,ENDNOTES:,full thirty thousand marks or better still were given to the poor for
5177,ENDNOTES:,his soul's sake. Yet his great beauty and his life lay low. When God
5178,ENDNOTES:,"had been served and the chants were ended, much people fought 'gainst"
5179,ENDNOTES:,monstrous grief. Men bade bear him from the minster to the grave. Those
5180,ENDNOTES:,were seen to weep and wail who missed him most. With loud laments the
5181,ENDNOTES:,"people followed hence; none was merry, neither wife nor man. They sang"
5182,ENDNOTES:,"and read a service before they buried him. Ho, what good priests were"
5183,ENDNOTES:,"present at his burial! Ere Siegfried's wife was come to the grave, her"
5184,ENDNOTES:,"faithful heart was rung with grief, so that they must needs oft sprinkle"
5185,ENDNOTES:,her with water from the spring. Her pain was passing great; a mickle
5186,ENDNOTES:,wonder it was that she ever lived. Many a lady helped her in her plaint.
5187,ENDNOTES:,
5188,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the queen: ""Ye men of Siegfried, by your loyalty must ye"

5191,ENDNOTES:,
5192,ENDNOTES:,"She begged so long, with griefs strong will, that they must needs break"

5194,ENDNOTES:,her white hand she raised his fair head and kissed the noble knight and
5195,ENDNOTES:,"good, thus dead. Tears of blood her bright eyes wept from grief. Then"
5196,ENDNOTES:,"there happed a piteous parting. Men bare her hence, she could not walk,"
5197,ENDNOTES:,and soon they found the high-born lady lying senseless. Fain would the

5199,ENDNOTES:,
5200,ENDNOTES:,"When they had now buried the noble lord, those who were come with him"

5340,ENDNOTES:,"they built for her a dwelling, broad and passing large, costly and"
5341,ENDNOTES:,"great, where, with her maids, she since dwelt joyless. She liked for to"
5342,ENDNOTES:,"go to church and did this willingly. Where her love lay buried, thither"
5343,ENDNOTES:,she went all time in mournful mood (how seldom she gave that over). She
5344,ENDNOTES:,prayed the good God to have mercy on her soul. With great fidelity she
5345,ENDNOTES:,"bewept the knight full oft. Uta and her meiny comforted her all time,"
5346,ENDNOTES:,"but so sorely wounded was her heart, that it booted naught, whatever"
5347,ENDNOTES:,comfort men did offer her. She had the greatest longing for her dear
5348,ENDNOTES:,"love, that ever wife did have for loving husband. One might see thereby"
5349,ENDNOTES:,"her passing virtue; until her end she mourned, the while life lasted. In"
5350,ENDNOTES:,after days brave Siegfried's wife avenged herself with might.
5351,ENDNOTES:,
5352,ENDNOTES:,"Thus she dwelt after her sorrow, after her husband's death, and this is"
5353,ENDNOTES:,"true, well three and one half years, that she spake no word to Gunther,"
5354,ENDNOTES:,nor did she see her foeman Hagen in all this time.
5355,ENDNOTES:,
5356,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Hagen of Troneg: ""If ye could compass it to make your sister"
5357,ENDNOTES:,"friendly, then might come to these lands the gold of Nibelung. Of this"

5367,ENDNOTES:,"done, Gernot and Giselher, the youth, were also brought. They tried"

5369,ENDNOTES:,"spake: ""Lady, ye mourn too long for Siegfried's death. The king will"

5373,ENDNOTES:,"She spake: ""None chargeth him with this. 'Twas Hagen's hand that struck"

5375,ENDNOTES:,I think that he did bear him hate? Else had I guarded against this full
5376,ENDNOTES:,"well,"" spake the queen, ""so that I had not betrayed his life; then would"
5377,ENDNOTES:,"I, poor wife, leave off my weeping. I'll never be a friend of him that"

5382,ENDNOTES:,Well he wot his guilt; 'twas he had caused her dole. When now she would
5383,ENDNOTES:,"forego her hate of Gunther, so that he might kiss her, it had befitted"
5384,ENDNOTES:,him better had she not been wronged by his advice; then might he have
5385,ENDNOTES:,gone boldly unto Kriemhild. Nevermore was peace between kindred brought
5386,ENDNOTES:,"to pass with so many tears; her loss still gave her woe. All, save the"
5387,ENDNOTES:,"one man alone, she pardoned. None had slain him, had not Hagen done the"
5388,ENDNOTES:,deed.
5389,ENDNOTES:,
5390,ENDNOTES:,Not long thereafter they brought it to pass that Lady Kriemhild gained
5391,ENDNOTES:,the hoard from the Nibelung land and brought it to the Rhine. It was
5392,ENDNOTES:,her marriage morning gift (1) and was hers by right. Giselher and Gernot
5393,ENDNOTES:,"rode to fetch it. Kriemhild ordered eighty hundred men, that they should"
5394,ENDNOTES:,"bring it from where it lay hid, where it was guarded by the knight"
5395,ENDNOTES:,Alberich (2) and his nearest kin. When they saw those from the Rhine
5396,ENDNOTES:,"coming for the hoard, Alberich, the bold, spake to his friends: ""Naught"

5401,ENDNOTES:,"it hath fared ill with Siegfried, that the hero bereft us of the Cloud"
5402,ENDNOTES:,"Cloak and that all this land did have to serve him."""
5403,ENDNOTES:,
5404,ENDNOTES:,Then went the warder to where he found the keys. Before the castle stood
5405,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild's liegemen and a deal of her kinsfolk. Men bade carry the
5406,ENDNOTES:,"treasure hence to the sea, down to the boats; one bare it then upon"
5407,ENDNOTES:,the waves to the mountains on the Rhine. Now may ye hear marvels of the
5408,ENDNOTES:,"hoard, the which twelve huge wains, packed full, were just able to bear"
5409,ENDNOTES:,away from the hill in four days and nights and each must make the trip
5410,ENDNOTES:,"three times a day. There was naught else but gems and gold, and had men"
5411,ENDNOTES:,"paid therewith the wage of all the world, not a mark less had it been"
5412,ENDNOTES:,in worth. Forsooth Hagen did not crave it so without good cause. The
5413,ENDNOTES:,greatest prize of all was a wishing-rod (3) of gold. He who knew its
5414,ENDNOTES:,"nature, might well be master over any man in all the world."
5415,ENDNOTES:,
5416,ENDNOTES:,Many of Alberich's kinsmen journeyed with Gernot hence. When they
5417,ENDNOTES:,stored away the hoard in Gunther's land and the queen took charge of
5418,ENDNOTES:,"everything, chambers and towers were filled therewith. Never did men"
5419,ENDNOTES:,hear tales told of such wondrous store of goods. And had it been a
5420,ENDNOTES:,"thousand times as much, if the Lord Siegfried were but alive again,"
5421,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild would fain have stood empty-handed at his side. No more
5422,ENDNOTES:,"faithful wife did hero ever win. Now that she had the hoard, she brought"
5423,ENDNOTES:,many unknown warriors to the land. In truth the lady's hand gave in
5424,ENDNOTES:,such wise that men have never seen such bounty more. She used great
5425,ENDNOTES:,courtesie; men owned this of the queen. To the rich and the poor she
5426,ENDNOTES:,"began to give so greatly that Hagen said, should she live yet a while,"
5427,ENDNOTES:,she would gain so many a man for her service that they would fare full
5428,ENDNOTES:,ill.
5429,ENDNOTES:,
5430,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake King Gunther: ""Her life and her goods be hers. How shall I"

5443,ENDNOTES:,
5444,ENDNOTES:,Few of their oaths were kept. From the widow they took the mighty

5815,ENDNOTES:,"fair women were seen to sit before her, but Kriemhild only nursed her"
5816,ENDNOTES:,grief; her dress upon her breast was wet with scalding tears. This the
5817,ENDNOTES:,noble margrave noted well on Kriemhild.
5818,ENDNOTES:,
5819,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the high-born messenger: ""Most noble princess, I pray you,"

5846,ENDNOTES:,"who were subject to my Lady Helca, and over many dames of high and"

5848,ENDNOTES:,"bold. ""Thereto my lord will give you (this he bade me say), if ye would"

5896,ENDNOTES:,
5897,ENDNOTES:,Thus she let the matter rest. All night until the break of day the lady
5898,ENDNOTES:,"lay upon her bed in thought. Her bright eyes never grew dry, till on the"
5899,ENDNOTES:,morn she went to matins. Just at the time for mass the kings were come
5900,ENDNOTES:,and took their sister again in hand. In truth they urged her to wed the
5901,ENDNOTES:,king of the Hunnish land; little did any of them find the lady merry.
5902,ENDNOTES:,"Then they bade fetch hither Etzel's men, who now would fain have taken"
5903,ENDNOTES:,"their leave, whatever the end might be, whether they gained or lost"
5904,ENDNOTES:,their suit. Rudeger came now to court; his heroes urged him to learn
5905,ENDNOTES:,aright the noble prince's mind. To all it seemed well that this be done
5906,ENDNOTES:,"betimes, for long was the way back into their land. Men brought Rudeger"
5907,ENDNOTES:,to where Kriemhild was found. Winningly the knight gan beg the noble
5908,ENDNOTES:,queen to let him hear what message she would send to Etzel's land. I
5909,ENDNOTES:,"ween, he heard from her naught else than no, that she nevermore would"
5910,ENDNOTES:,"wed a man. The margrave spake: ""That were ill done. Why would ye let"
5911,ENDNOTES:,such beauty wither? Still with honor may ye become the bride of a worthy
5912,ENDNOTES:,"man."""
5913,ENDNOTES:,
5914,ENDNOTES:,"Naught booted that they urged, till Rudeger told the noble queen in"
5915,ENDNOTES:,secret that he would make amends for all that ever happed to her. At
5916,ENDNOTES:,"this her great sorrow grew a deal more mild. To the queen he spake: ""Let"

5919,ENDNOTES:,
5920,ENDNOTES:,"At this the lady's mood grew gentler. She spake: ""Then swear me an"

5968,ENDNOTES:,"Albeit they had aye worn costly robes, many more were now made ready,"
5969,ENDNOTES:,"for much had been told them of the king. They opened up the chests,"
5970,ENDNOTES:,which stood afore well locked. For four and one half days they were
5971,ENDNOTES:,aught but idle; from the presses they brought forth the stores that lay
5972,ENDNOTES:,"therein. Kriemhild now began to open up her treasure rooms, she fain"
5973,ENDNOTES:,would make all Rudeger's liegemen rich. Of the gold from the Nibelung
5974,ENDNOTES:,land she still had such store that a hundred horses might not bear it;
5975,ENDNOTES:,she weened her hand should deal it out among the Huns.
5976,ENDNOTES:,
5977,ENDNOTES:,"This tale Hagen heard told of Kriemhild. He spake: ""Sith Kriemhild will"
5978,ENDNOTES:,"not become my friend, so Siegfried's gold must stay behind. For why"

6006,ENDNOTES:,
6007,ENDNOTES:,Afore this her maids had filled twelve chests at leisure with the very

6009,ENDNOTES:,"store of women's trinkets, which they should wear upon the road. Her"
6010,ENDNOTES:,thought too great the might of Hagen. Of her gold for offerings (7) she
6011,ENDNOTES:,had still a thousand marks. For her dear husband's soul she dealt it
6012,ENDNOTES:,out. This Rudeger thought was done in faithful love. Then spake the
6013,ENDNOTES:,"mournful lady: ""Where be now my friends who for my sake would live in"
6014,ENDNOTES:,"exile? Let those who would ride with me to the Hunnish land, take now my"

6022,ENDNOTES:,
6023,ENDNOTES:,For this speech Kriemhild bowed her thanks; forsooth she had full need.
6024,ENDNOTES:,
6025,ENDNOTES:,Men now led forth the palfreys; for they would ride away. Then many
6026,ENDNOTES:,tears were shed by kinsfolk. Royal Uta and many a comely maiden showed
6027,ENDNOTES:,that they were sad at Kriemhild's loss. A hundred high-born maids she
6028,ENDNOTES:,"took with her hence, who were arrayed as well befit them. Then from"
6029,ENDNOTES:,"bright eyes the tears fell down, but soon at Etzel's court they lived"
6030,ENDNOTES:,"to see much joy. Then came Lord Giselher and Gernot, too, with their"
6031,ENDNOTES:,"fellowship, as their courtesie demanded. Fain would they escort their"
6032,ENDNOTES:,dear sister hence; of their knights they took with them full a thousand
6033,ENDNOTES:,"stately men. Then came Ortwin and the doughty Gere; Rumolt, the master"
6034,ENDNOTES:,"of the kitchen, must needs be with them, too. They purveyed them night"
6035,ENDNOTES:,"quarters as far as the Danube's shore, but Gunther rode no further than"
6036,ENDNOTES:,"a little from the town. Ere they fared hence from the Rhine, they had"
6037,ENDNOTES:,"sent their messengers swiftly on ahead to the Hunnish land, who"
6038,ENDNOTES:,should tell the king that Rudeger had gained for him to wife the noble

6075,ENDNOTES:,
6076,ENDNOTES:,"Let now the messengers ride. We will do you to wit, how the queen"
6077,ENDNOTES:,journeyed through the lands and where Giselher and Gernot parted from
6078,ENDNOTES:,her. They had served her as their fealty bade them. Down to Vergen (1)
6079,ENDNOTES:,"on the Danube they rode; here they gan crave leave of the queen, for"
6080,ENDNOTES:,they would ride again to the Rhine. Without tears these faithful kinsmen
6081,ENDNOTES:,"might not part. Doughty Giselher spake then to his sister: ""Whenever,"
6082,ENDNOTES:,"lady, thou shouldst need me, when aught doth trouble thee, let me but"
6083,ENDNOTES:,"know, and I will ride in thy service to Etzel's land."""
6084,ENDNOTES:,
6085,ENDNOTES:,Those who were her kin she kissed upon the mouth. Lovingly they took
6086,ENDNOTES:,their leave of Margrave Rudeger's men. The queen had with her many a
6087,ENDNOTES:,"fair-fashioned maid, full a hundred and four, that wore costly robes"
6088,ENDNOTES:,"of rich, gay-colored silks. Many broad shields were borne close by the"
6089,ENDNOTES:,"ladies on the road, but many a lordly warrior turned then from her."
6090,ENDNOTES:,
6091,ENDNOTES:,They journeyed soon from thence down through Bavarian land. Here the
6092,ENDNOTES:,"tale was told that many unknown strangers had gathered there, where"
6093,ENDNOTES:,still a cloister standeth and where the Inn floweth into the Danube. In
6094,ENDNOTES:,"the town of Passau, where lived a bishop, lodgings were soon emptied and"
6095,ENDNOTES:,"the prince's court as well, as they hurried forth to meet the strangers"
6096,ENDNOTES:,"in the Bavarian land, where the Bishop Pilgrim (2) found fair Kriemhild."
6097,ENDNOTES:,"The knights of the land were little loth, when in her train they saw so"
6098,ENDNOTES:,many comely maids; with their eyes they courted the daughters of noble
6099,ENDNOTES:,knights. Later good lodgings were given the noble guests.
6100,ENDNOTES:,
6101,ENDNOTES:,With his niece the bishop rode toward Passau. When it was told the
6102,ENDNOTES:,"burghers of the town that Kriemhild was come, their prince's sister's"
6103,ENDNOTES:,"child, well was she greeted by the merchants. The bishop had the hope"
6104,ENDNOTES:,"that they would stay. Then spake Sir Eckewart: ""That may not be. We must"
6105,ENDNOTES:,"fare further down to Rudeger's land. Many knights await us, for all wot"
6106,ENDNOTES:,"well the news."""
6107,ENDNOTES:,
6108,ENDNOTES:,Well wist fair Gotelind the tale. She tired her and her noble child with
6109,ENDNOTES:,care. Rudeger had sent her word that it thought him good that she should
6110,ENDNOTES:,"cheer the mind of the queen by riding forth, with his vassals to the"
6111,ENDNOTES:,"Enns (3) for to meet her. When this message had been given, one saw"
6112,ENDNOTES:,on every side the roads alive; on foot and horse they hastened to meet
6113,ENDNOTES:,their guests. Now was the queen come to Efferding. (4) Enow there were
6114,ENDNOTES:,from the Bavarian land who might perchance have done the guests much
6115,ENDNOTES:,"harm, had they robbed upon the roads, as was their wont. That had been"
6116,ENDNOTES:,forestalled by the lordly margrave: he led a thousand knights or more.
6117,ENDNOTES:,
6118,ENDNOTES:,"Now Gotelind, the wife of Rudeger, was come; with her there rode many a"
6119,ENDNOTES:,"noble knight in lordly vise. When they were come across the Traun, (5)"
6120,ENDNOTES:,"upon the plain by Enns, one saw erected huts and tents, where the guests"
6121,ENDNOTES:,should have their lodgings for the night. Rudeger gave the vitaille to
6122,ENDNOTES:,his guests. Fair Gotelind left her lodgings far behind her; along the
6123,ENDNOTES:,road there trotted many a shapely palfrey with jingling bridle. Fair
6124,ENDNOTES:,was the welcome; right well was Rudeger pleased. Among those who rode to
6125,ENDNOTES:,"meet them on the way, on either side, in praiseworthy wise, was many a"
6126,ENDNOTES:,"knight. They practised chivalry, the which full many a maiden saw. Nor"
6127,ENDNOTES:,did the service of the knights mislike the queen. When that Rudeger's
6128,ENDNOTES:,"liegemen met the guests, many truncheons (6) were seen to fly on high"
6129,ENDNOTES:,from the warriors' hands in knightly custom. As though for a prize they
6130,ENDNOTES:,rode before the ladies there. This they soon gave over and many warriors
6131,ENDNOTES:,greeted each other in friendly wise. Then they escorted fair Gotelind
6132,ENDNOTES:,from thence to where she saw Kriemhild. Scant leisure had they who wot
6133,ENDNOTES:,how to serve the ladies.
6134,ENDNOTES:,
6135,ENDNOTES:,The lord of Bechelaren rode now to his wife. Little it irked the noble
6136,ENDNOTES:,margravine that he was come so well and sound from the Rhine. In part
6137,ENDNOTES:,"her cares had given way to joy. When she had welcomed him, he bade"
6138,ENDNOTES:,her dismount with the ladies of her train upon the sward. Many a
6139,ENDNOTES:,noble knight bestirred him and served the ladies with eager zeal. Then
6140,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild spied the margravine standing with her meiny. No nearer she
6141,ENDNOTES:,"drew, but checked the palfrey with the bridle and bade them lift her"
6142,ENDNOTES:,quickly from the saddle. Men saw the bishop with Eckewart lead his
6143,ENDNOTES:,sister's child to Gotelind. All stood aside at once. Then the exiled
6144,ENDNOTES:,queen kissed Gotelind upon the mouth. Full lovingly spake Rudeger's
6145,ENDNOTES:,"wife: ""Now well is me, dear lady, that I have ever seen with mine own"
6146,ENDNOTES:,eyes your charming self in these our lands. Naught liefer might hap to
6147,ENDNOTES:,"me in all these times."""
6148,ENDNOTES:,
6149,ENDNOTES:,"""Now God requite you,"" quoth Kriemhild, ""most noble Gotelind. Shall I"
6150,ENDNOTES:,"and Botelung's (7) son remain alive and well, it may be lief to you that"
6151,ENDNOTES:,"ye have seen me here."""
6152,ENDNOTES:,
6153,ENDNOTES:,Neither knew what must needs later hap. Many maidens went to meet each
6154,ENDNOTES:,"other in courtly wise. The warriors, too, were full ready with their"
6155,ENDNOTES:,service. After the greeting they sat them down upon the clover. With
6156,ENDNOTES:,"many they became acquaint, who were full strange to them aforetime. As"
6157,ENDNOTES:,"it was now high noon, men bade pour out wine for the ladies. The"
6158,ENDNOTES:,"noble meiny no longer tarried, but rode to where they found many broad"
6159,ENDNOTES:,pavilions; there ample service stood ready for the guests.
6160,ENDNOTES:,
6161,ENDNOTES:,That night they had repose till early on the morn. Those from Bechelaren
6162,ENDNOTES:,"made ready for to lodge the worthy guests. So well had Rudeger planned,"
6163,ENDNOTES:,"that little enow they lacked. The embrasures in the walls stood open,"
6164,ENDNOTES:,the castle at Bechelaren was opened wide. In rode the guests whom men
6165,ENDNOTES:,were fain to see; the noble host bade purvey them proper easement. Most
6166,ENDNOTES:,lovingly Rudeger's daughter with her meiny went to welcome the queen.
6167,ENDNOTES:,"There, too, stood her mother, the margrave's wife; many a high-born maid"
6168,ENDNOTES:,was greeted with delight. They took each other by the hand and hied
6169,ENDNOTES:,"them hence to a broad hall, fashioned full fair, under which the Danube"
6170,ENDNOTES:,flowed along. Towards the breeze they sate and held great pastime. What
6171,ENDNOTES:,"more they did I cannot tell, save that Kriemhild's men-at-arms were"
6172,ENDNOTES:,"heard to grumble that they fared so slowly on their way, for much it"
6173,ENDNOTES:,"irked them. Ho, what good knights rode with them hence from Bechelaren!"
6174,ENDNOTES:,
6175,ENDNOTES:,Rudeger offered them much loving service. The queen gave Gotelind's
6176,ENDNOTES:,"daughter twelve ruddy armlets, and raiment too, as good as any that she"
6177,ENDNOTES:,"brought to Etzel's land. Although the Nibelung gold was taken from her,"
6178,ENDNOTES:,yet she did win the hearts of all that saw her with the little she still
6179,ENDNOTES:,might have. Great gifts were given to the courtiers of the host. In
6180,ENDNOTES:,turn the Lady Gotelind offered the guests from the Rhine worship in such
6181,ENDNOTES:,"friendly wise, that men found passing few of the strangers that did not"
6182,ENDNOTES:,wear her jewels or her lordly robes.
6183,ENDNOTES:,
6184,ENDNOTES:,"When they had eaten and should depart, faithful service was proffered by"
6185,ENDNOTES:,"the lady of the house to Etzel's bride. The fair young margravine, too,"
6186,ENDNOTES:,"was much caressed. To the queen she spake: ""Whenso it thinketh you"
6187,ENDNOTES:,"good, I know well that my dear father will gladly send me to you to"
6188,ENDNOTES:,"the Hunnish land."" How well Kriemhild marked that the maiden loved her"
6189,ENDNOTES:,truly.
6190,ENDNOTES:,
6191,ENDNOTES:,The steeds were harnessed and led before the castle of Bechelaren
6192,ENDNOTES:,and the noble queen took leave of Rudeger's wife and daughter. With
6193,ENDNOTES:,a greeting many a fair maid parted too. Full seldom did they see each
6194,ENDNOTES:,other since these days. From Medelick (8) the folk bare in their hands
6195,ENDNOTES:,"many a rich cup of gold, in which they offered wine to the strangers"
6196,ENDNOTES:,"on the highway. Thus they made them welcome. A host dwelt there, hight"
6197,ENDNOTES:,"Astolt, (9) who showed them the road to the Austrian land, towards"
6198,ENDNOTES:,Mautern (10) down the Danube. There the noble queen was later served
6199,ENDNOTES:,full well. From his niece the bishop parted lovingly. How he counseled
6200,ENDNOTES:,her that she should bear her well and that she should purchase honor
6201,ENDNOTES:,"for herself, as Helca, too, had done! Ho, what great worship she later"
6202,ENDNOTES:,gained among the Huns!
6203,ENDNOTES:,
6204,ENDNOTES:,To the Traisem (11) they escorted hence the guests. Rudeger's men
6205,ENDNOTES:,"purveyed them zealously, until the Huns came riding across the land."
6206,ENDNOTES:,Then the queen became acquaint with mickle honor. Near the Traisem the
6207,ENDNOTES:,"king of the Hunnish land did have a mighty castle, hight Zeisenmauer,"
6208,ENDNOTES:,(12) known far and wide. Lady Helca dwelt there aforetime and used such
6209,ENDNOTES:,"great virtues that it might not lightly ever hap again, unless it be"
6210,ENDNOTES:,"through Kriemhild. She wist so how to give, that after all her sorrow"
6211,ENDNOTES:,"she had the joy that Etzel's liegemen gave her great worship, of which"
6212,ENDNOTES:,she later won great store among the heroes. Etzel's rule was known far
6213,ENDNOTES:,"and wide, so that all time one found at his court the boldest warriors"
6214,ENDNOTES:,"of whom men ever heard, among Christian or among paynim. They were all"
6215,ENDNOTES:,"come with him. All time there were at his court, what may not so lightly"
6216,ENDNOTES:,"hap again, Christian customs and also heathen faith. In whatsoever wise"
6217,ENDNOTES:,"each lived, the bounty of the king bestowed on all enow."

6264,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE XXII. How Etzel Made Kriemhild His Bride.
6265,ENDNOTES:,
6266,ENDNOTES:,Until the fourth day she stayed at Zeisenmauer. The while the dust upon
6267,ENDNOTES:,"the highway never came to rest, but rose on every side, as if it were"
6268,ENDNOTES:,"burning, where King Etzel's liegemen rode through Austria. Then the"
6269,ENDNOTES:,king was told aright how royally Kriemhild fared through the lands; at
6270,ENDNOTES:,thought of this his sorrows vanished. He hasted to where he found the
6271,ENDNOTES:,lovely Kriemhild. Men saw ride before King Etzel on the road many bold
6272,ENDNOTES:,knights of many tongues and many mighty troops of Christians and of
6273,ENDNOTES:,"paynims. When they met the lady, they rode along in lordly wise. Of"
6274,ENDNOTES:,the Russians and the Greeks there rode there many a man. The right good
6275,ENDNOTES:,"steeds of the Poles and Wallachians were seen to gallop swiftly, as they"
6276,ENDNOTES:,rode with might and main. Each did show the customs of his land.
6277,ENDNOTES:,From the land of Kiev (1) there rode many a warrior and the savage
6278,ENDNOTES:,Petschenegers. (2) With the bow they often shot at the birds which flew
6279,ENDNOTES:,there; to the very head they drew the arrows on the bows.
6280,ENDNOTES:,
6281,ENDNOTES:,By the Danube there lieth in the Austrian land a town that men call
6282,ENDNOTES:,"Tulna. (3) There she became acquaint with many a foreign custom, the"
6283,ENDNOTES:,which size had never seen afore. She greeted there enow who later came
6284,ENDNOTES:,"through her to grief. Before Etzel there rode a retinue, merry and"
6285,ENDNOTES:,"noble, courtly and lusty, full four and twenty princes, mighty and of"
6286,ENDNOTES:,lofty birth. They would fain behold their lady and craved naught more.
6287,ENDNOTES:,"Duke Ramung (4) of Wallachia, with seven hundred vassals, galloped up"
6288,ENDNOTES:,before her; like flying birds men saw them ride. Then came Prince Gibeck
6289,ENDNOTES:,"with lordly bands. The doughty Hornbog, (5) with full a thousand men,"
6290,ENDNOTES:,wheeled from the king away towards the queen. Loudly they shouted after
6291,ENDNOTES:,the custom of their land. Madly too rode the kinsmen of the Huns. Then
6292,ENDNOTES:,"came brave Hawart (6) of Denmark and the doughty Iring, (7) free of"
6293,ENDNOTES:,"guile was he, and Irnfried (8) of Thuringia, a stately man. With twelve"
6294,ENDNOTES:,"hundred vassals, whom they had in their band, they greeted Kriemhild,"
6295,ENDNOTES:,"so that she had therefrom great worship. Then came Sir Bloedel, (9)"
6296,ENDNOTES:,"King Etzel's brother, from the Hunnish land, with three thousand men."
6297,ENDNOTES:,In lordly wise he rode to where he found the queen. Then King Etzel
6298,ENDNOTES:,"came and Sir Dietrich, too, with all his fellowship. There stood many"
6299,ENDNOTES:,"worshipful knights, noble, worthy, and good. At this Dame Kriemhild's"
6300,ENDNOTES:,spirits rose.
6301,ENDNOTES:,
6302,ENDNOTES:,"Then Sir Rudeger spake to the queen: ""Lady, here will I receive the"
6303,ENDNOTES:,"high-born king; whomso I bid you kiss, that must ye do. Forsooth ye may"
6304,ENDNOTES:,"not greet alike King Etzel's men."""
6305,ENDNOTES:,
6306,ENDNOTES:,"From the palfrey they helped the royal queen alight. Etzel, the mighty,"
6307,ENDNOTES:,"bode no more, but dismounted from his steed with many a valiant man."
6308,ENDNOTES:,"Joyfully men saw them go towards Kriemhild. Two mighty princes, as we"
6309,ENDNOTES:,"are told, walked by the lady and bore her train, when King Etzel went"
6310,ENDNOTES:,"to meet her, where she greeted the noble lording with a kiss in gracious"
6311,ENDNOTES:,wise. She raised her veil and from out the gold beamed forth her rosy
6312,ENDNOTES:,hue. Many a man stood there who vowed that Lady Helca could not have
6313,ENDNOTES:,"been more fair than she. Close by stood also Bloedel, the brother of the"
6314,ENDNOTES:,"king. Him Rudeger, the mighty margrave, bade her kiss and King Gibeck,"
6315,ENDNOTES:,too. There also stood Sir Dietrich. Twelve of the warriors the king's
6316,ENDNOTES:,bride kissed. She greeted many knights in other ways.
6317,ENDNOTES:,
6318,ENDNOTES:,"All the while that Etzel stood at Kriemhild's side, the youthful"
6319,ENDNOTES:,warriors did as people still are wont to do. One saw them riding many a
6320,ENDNOTES:,"royal joust. This Christian champions did and paynim, too, according"
6321,ENDNOTES:,to their custom. In what right knightly wise the men of Dietrich made
6322,ENDNOTES:,"truncheons from the shafts fly through the air, high above the shields,"
6323,ENDNOTES:,from the hands of doughty knights! Many a buckler's edge was pierced
6324,ENDNOTES:,through and through by the German strangers. Great crashing of breaking
6325,ENDNOTES:,shafts was heard. All the warriors from the land were come and the
6326,ENDNOTES:,"king's guests, too, many a noble man."
6327,ENDNOTES:,
6328,ENDNOTES:,Then the mighty king betook him hence with Lady Kriemhild. Hard by them
6329,ENDNOTES:,a royal tent was seen to stand; around about the plain was filled with
6330,ENDNOTES:,"booths, where they should rest them after their toils. Many a comely"
6331,ENDNOTES:,"maid was shown to her place thereunder by the knights, where she then"
6332,ENDNOTES:,sate with the queen on richly covered chairs. The margrave had so well
6333,ENDNOTES:,"purveyed the seats for Kriemhild, that all found them passing good; at"
6334,ENDNOTES:,"this King Etzel grew blithe of mood. What the king there spake, I know"
6335,ENDNOTES:,not. In his right lay her snow-white hand; thus they sate in lover's
6336,ENDNOTES:,"wise, since Rudeger would not let the king make love to Kriemhild"
6337,ENDNOTES:,secretly.
6338,ENDNOTES:,
6339,ENDNOTES:,Then one bade the tourney cease on every side; in courtly wise the
6340,ENDNOTES:,great rout ended. Etzel's men betook them to the booths; men gave them
6341,ENDNOTES:,lodgings stretching far away on every side. The day had now an end; they
6342,ENDNOTES:,"lay at ease, till the bright morn was seen to dawn again, then many a"
6343,ENDNOTES:,"man betook him to the steeds. Ho, what pastimes they gan ply in honor of"
6344,ENDNOTES:,the king! Etzel bade the Huns purvey all with fitting honors. Then they
6345,ENDNOTES:,"rode from Tulna to the town of Vienna, where they found many a dame"
6346,ENDNOTES:,adorned. With great worship these greeted King Etzel's bride. There was
6347,ENDNOTES:,ready for them in great plenty whatever they should have. Many a lusty
6348,ENDNOTES:,hero rejoiced at prospect of the rout.
6349,ENDNOTES:,
6350,ENDNOTES:,The king's wedding feast commenced in merry wise. They began to lodge
6351,ENDNOTES:,"the guests, but quarters could not be found for all within the town."
6352,ENDNOTES:,Rudeger therefore begged those that were not guests to take lodgings in
6353,ENDNOTES:,"the country round about. I ween men found all time by Lady Kriemhild,"
6354,ENDNOTES:,Sir Dietrich and many another knight. Their rest they had given over
6355,ENDNOTES:,"for toil, that they might purvey the guests good cheer. Rudeger and his"
6356,ENDNOTES:,"friends had pastime good. The wedding feast fell on a Whitsuntide,"
6357,ENDNOTES:,when King Etzel lay by Kriemhild in the town of Vienna. With her first
6358,ENDNOTES:,"husband, I trow, she did not win so many men for service. Through"
6359,ENDNOTES:,presents she made her known to those who had never seen her. Full many
6360,ENDNOTES:,"among them spake to the guests: ""We weened that Lady Kriemhild had"
6361,ENDNOTES:,"naught of goods, now hath she wrought many wonders with her gifts."""
6362,ENDNOTES:,
6363,ENDNOTES:,The feasting lasted seventeen days. I trow men can no longer tell of any
6364,ENDNOTES:,"king whose wedding feast was greater. If so be, 'tis hidden from us."
6365,ENDNOTES:,"All that were present wore brand-new garments. I ween, she never dwelt"
6366,ENDNOTES:,before in Netherland with such retinue of knights. Though Siegfried was
6367,ENDNOTES:,"rich in goods, I trow, he never won so many noble men-at-arms, as she"
6368,ENDNOTES:,saw stand 'fore Etzel. Nor hath any ever given at his own wedding feast
6369,ENDNOTES:,"so many costly mantles, long and wide, nor such good clothes, of which"
6370,ENDNOTES:,"all had here great store, given for Kriemhild's sake. Her friends and"
6371,ENDNOTES:,"the strangers, too, were minded to spare no kind of goods. Whatever any"
6372,ENDNOTES:,"craved, this they willingly gave, so that many of the knights through"
6373,ENDNOTES:,bounty stood bereft of clothes. Kriemhild thought of how she dwelt with
6374,ENDNOTES:,"her noble husband by the Rhine; her eyes grew moist, but she hid it full"
6375,ENDNOTES:,"well, that none might see it. Great worship had been done her after"
6376,ENDNOTES:,"many a grief. Whatever bounty any used, 'twas but a wind to that of"
6377,ENDNOTES:,"Dietrich. What Botelung's son had given him, was squandered quite."
6378,ENDNOTES:,Rudeger's lavish hand did also many wonders. Prince Bloedel of Hungary
6379,ENDNOTES:,bade empty many traveling chests of their silver and their gold; all
6380,ENDNOTES:,this was given away. The king's champions were seen to live right
6381,ENDNOTES:,"merrily. Werbel and Swemmel, (10) the minstrels of the king, each gained"
6382,ENDNOTES:,"at the wedding feast, I ween, full thousand marks, or even better, when"
6383,ENDNOTES:,fair Kriemhild sate crowned at Etzel's side.
6384,ENDNOTES:,
6385,ENDNOTES:,On the eighteenth morning they rode forth from Vienna. Many shields were
6386,ENDNOTES:,"pierced in tilting by spears, which the warriors bare in hand. Thus King"
6387,ENDNOTES:,Etzel came down to the Hunnish land. They spent the night at ancient
6388,ENDNOTES:,"Heimburg. (11) No one might know the press of folk, or with what force"
6389,ENDNOTES:,"they rode across the land. Ho, what fair women they found in Etzel's"
6390,ENDNOTES:,native land! At mighty Misenburg (12) they boarded ship. The water which
6391,ENDNOTES:,"men saw flowing there was covered with steeds and men, as if it were"
6392,ENDNOTES:,solid earth. The wayworn ladies had their ease and rest. Many good ships
6393,ENDNOTES:,"were lashed together, that neither waves nor flood might do them harm."
6394,ENDNOTES:,"Upon them many a goodly tent was spread, as if they still had both land"
6395,ENDNOTES:,and plain.
6396,ENDNOTES:,
6397,ENDNOTES:,"From thence tidings came to Etzelburg, (13) at which both men and"
6398,ENDNOTES:,"wives therein were glad. Helca's meiny, that aforetime waited on their"
6399,ENDNOTES:,"mistress, passed many a happy day thereafter at Kriemhild's side. There"
6400,ENDNOTES:,"many a noble maid stood waiting, who had great grief through Helca's"
6401,ENDNOTES:,"death. Kriemhild found still seven royal princesses there, through whom"
6402,ENDNOTES:,all Etzel's land was graced. For the meiny the high-born maiden Herrat
6403,ENDNOTES:,"(14) cared, the daughter of Helca's sister, beseen with many courtly"
6404,ENDNOTES:,"virtues, the betrothed of Dietrich, a royal child, King Nentwin's (15)"
6405,ENDNOTES:,daughter; much worship she later had. Blithe of heart she was at the
6406,ENDNOTES:,"coming of the guests; for this, too, mighty treasures were prepared."
6407,ENDNOTES:,Who might tell the tale of how the king held court? Never had men lived
6408,ENDNOTES:,better among the Huns with any queen.
6409,ENDNOTES:,
6410,ENDNOTES:,"When that the king with his wife rode from the shore, the noble"
6411,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild was told full well who each one was; she greeted them the
6412,ENDNOTES:,"better. Ho, how royally she ruled in Helca's stead! She became acquaint"
6413,ENDNOTES:,"with much loyal service. Then the queen dealt out gold and vesture, silk"
6414,ENDNOTES:,and precious stones. Whatever she brought with her across the Rhine to
6415,ENDNOTES:,Hungary must needs be given all away. All the king's kinsmen and all
6416,ENDNOTES:,"his liegemen then owned her service, so that Lady Helca never ruled so"
6417,ENDNOTES:,"mightily as she, whom they now must serve till Kriemhild's death. The"
6418,ENDNOTES:,"court and all the land lived in such high honors, that all time men"
6419,ENDNOTES:,"found the pastimes which each heart desired, through the favor of the"
6420,ENDNOTES:,king and his good queen.

6485,ENDNOTES:,ADVENTURE XXIII. How Kriemhild Thought To Avenge Her Wrongs.
6486,ENDNOTES:,
6487,ENDNOTES:,With great worship of a truth they lived together until the seventh
6488,ENDNOTES:,"year. In this time the queen was delivered of a son, at which King Etzel"
6489,ENDNOTES:,"could not have been more joyful. She would not turn back, until she"
6490,ENDNOTES:,brought it to pass that Etzel's child was christened after the Christian
6491,ENDNOTES:,rite. Men named it Ortlieb; (1) at this great joy arose over all of
6492,ENDNOTES:,"Etzel's lands. Whatever courtly breeding Lady Helca had possessed, Dame"
6493,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild practiced this full many a day. Herrat, the exiled maid, who"
6494,ENDNOTES:,"in secret grieved full sore for Helca, taught her the customs. Well was"
6495,ENDNOTES:,she known to the strangers and the home-folk. They vowed that never had
6496,ENDNOTES:,a kingdom had a better or more bounteous queen. This they held for true.
6497,ENDNOTES:,She bare this praise among the Huns until the thirteenth year. Now wot
6498,ENDNOTES:,"she well, that none would thwart her, as royal men-at-arms still do to a"
6499,ENDNOTES:,"prince's wife, and that all time she saw twelve kings stand before"
6500,ENDNOTES:,"her. Over many a wrong she brooded, that had happed to her at home. She"
6501,ENDNOTES:,"thought likewise on the many honors in the Nibelung land, which she"
6502,ENDNOTES:,had there enjoyed and of which Hagen's hand had quite bereft her at
6503,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried's death, and if perchance she might not make him suffer for"
6504,ENDNOTES:,"his deed. ""That would hap, if I might but bring him to this land."" She"
6505,ENDNOTES:,"dreamed that Giselher, her brother, walked often with her hand in hand."
6506,ENDNOTES:,Alway she kissed him in her gentle slumber; later suffering came to
6507,ENDNOTES:,"both. I ween, the foul fiend did counsel Kriemhild this, that she"
6508,ENDNOTES:,"withdrew her friendship from Giselher, whom for forgiveness' sake she"
6509,ENDNOTES:,had kissed in the Burgundian land. At this hot tears again gan soil her
6510,ENDNOTES:,"robe. Early and late it lay within her heart, how without fault of hers"
6511,ENDNOTES:,they had made her wed a heathen man. Hagen and Gunther had brought her
6512,ENDNOTES:,to this pass. This wish she seldom gave over in her heart. She thought:
6513,ENDNOTES:,"""I am so mighty and have such great wealth, that I can do my foes an"
6514,ENDNOTES:,injury yet. Full ready would I be for this towards Hagen of Troneg. My
6515,ENDNOTES:,heart doth often yearn for my faithful kin. Might I be with those who
6516,ENDNOTES:,"did me wrong, my lover's death would be well avenged. Scarce can I abide"
6517,ENDNOTES:,"this,"" spake Etzel's wife."
6518,ENDNOTES:,
6519,ENDNOTES:,"All the king's men, Kriemhild's warriors, bare her love in duty bound."
6520,ENDNOTES:,"Of the chamber Eckewart had charge, which won him friends. None might"
6521,ENDNOTES:,"gainsay Dame Kriemhild's will. All time she thought: ""I will beg the"
6522,ENDNOTES:,"king, that he in kindly wise may grant me to bring my kinsmen to the"
6523,ENDNOTES:,"Hunnish land."" None marked the evil purpose of the queen. One night when"
6524,ENDNOTES:,"she lay by the king, and he did hold her in his arms, as he was wont"
6525,ENDNOTES:,"to love the noble dame, who was dear to him as life, the high-born lady"
6526,ENDNOTES:,"thought her of her foes. To the king she spake: ""Dear my lord, I would"
6527,ENDNOTES:,"fain beseech you, by your grace, that ye would show me that ye did love"
6528,ENDNOTES:,"my kinsfolk, if I have earned the favor."""
6529,ENDNOTES:,
6530,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the king (true was his heart): ""I'll give you to know however"
6531,ENDNOTES:,"well the knights may fare, I may well have joy of this, for never have I"
6532,ENDNOTES:,"won better kin through woman's love."""
6533,ENDNOTES:,
6534,ENDNOTES:,"Again the queen spake: ""It hath been well told you, that I have"
6535,ENDNOTES:,high-born kin; therefore do I grieve that they so seldom reck to see me
6536,ENDNOTES:,"here. I hear the folk aver that I be banished."""
6537,ENDNOTES:,
6538,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake king Etzel: ""Dear lady mine, and it think you not too far,"
6539,ENDNOTES:,"I'll bid hither to my lands, from across the Rhine, whomso ye be fain to"
6540,ENDNOTES:,"see."""
6541,ENDNOTES:,
6542,ENDNOTES:,"The lady joyed her when she heard his will. She spake: ""Would ye show me"
6543,ENDNOTES:,"your faith, my lord, then send envoys to Worms across the Rhine, through"
6544,ENDNOTES:,whom I may tell my kinsfolk what I have in mind. Thus there will come

6546,ENDNOTES:,
6547,ENDNOTES:,"He answered: ""It shall hap whenso ye bid. Ye might not be more glad to"
6548,ENDNOTES:,see your kin than I to see the sons of the noble Uta. It doth irk me
6549,ENDNOTES:,"sore, that they have been strangers to us so long a time. If it please"
6550,ENDNOTES:,"you, dear lady mine, I would fain send my minstrels for your kinsmen to"
6551,ENDNOTES:,"the Burgundian land."""
6552,ENDNOTES:,
6553,ENDNOTES:,He bade the good minstrels be fetched straightway. Quickly they hasted
6554,ENDNOTES:,to where the king sate by the queen. He told the twain they should be
6555,ENDNOTES:,envoys to the Burgundian land and bade full lordly weeds be made ready
6556,ENDNOTES:,"for them. Clothing was prepared for four and twenty warriors, and the"
6557,ENDNOTES:,"message was told them by the king, how they should bid Gunther and his"
6558,ENDNOTES:,"liegemen hither. Kriemhild, the queen, talked with them apart. Then"
6559,ENDNOTES:,"spake the mighty king: ""I'll tell you what to say. I offer to my kin my"
6560,ENDNOTES:,"love and service, that it may please them to ride hither to my land. But"
6561,ENDNOTES:,"few such welcome guests have I known, and if they perchance will fulfill"
6562,ENDNOTES:,"my wish, tell Kriemhild's kinsmen that they must not fall to come this"
6563,ENDNOTES:,"summer to my feast, for much of my joy doth lie upon the kinsmen of my"

6565,ENDNOTES:,
6566,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the minstrel, the proud Swemmel: ""When shall your feasting be"

6568,ENDNOTES:,
6569,ENDNOTES:,"King Etzel answered: ""On next midsummer's day."""

6572,ENDNOTES:,
6573,ENDNOTES:,"The queen bade them be brought secretly unto her bower, where she"
6574,ENDNOTES:,then talked with the envoys. From this but little joy happed to many a

6576,ENDNOTES:,that ye do my pleasure full willingly and give the message which I send
6577,ENDNOTES:,to my native land. I'll make you rich in goods and give you the lordly
6578,ENDNOTES:,"robes. And if ye see any of my kin at Worms upon the Rhine, ye must not"
6579,ENDNOTES:,tell them that ye ever saw me sad of heart. Tender my service to the
6580,ENDNOTES:,heroes brave and good. Beg that they do as the king doth bid and thus
6581,ENDNOTES:,"part me from all my grief. The Huns ween, I be without kith and kin."
6582,ENDNOTES:,"Were I a knight, I'd visit them myself at times. And say to Gernot, too,"
6583,ENDNOTES:,"the noble brother of mine, that none in the world doth love him more."
6584,ENDNOTES:,"Beg him to bring with him to this land our best of friends, that it may"
6585,ENDNOTES:,"be to our honor. Say also to Giselher, that he remember well, I never"
6586,ENDNOTES:,gained grief through fault of his. Therefore would mine eyes fain sue
6587,ENDNOTES:,him. For his great loyalty I would gladly have him here. Tell my mother
6588,ENDNOTES:,"also of the honors which I have, and if Hagen of Troneg be minded to"

6591,ENDNOTES:,
6592,ENDNOTES:,"The envoys wist not, why it was done, that they should not let Hagen of"

6594,ENDNOTES:,many a knight was doomed to a savage death. Letters and messages had now
6595,ENDNOTES:,"been given them. They rode forth rich in goods, and well could lead a"

6614,ENDNOTES:,
6615,ENDNOTES:,"When that Etzel had sent his envoys to the Rhine, these tidings flew"
6616,ENDNOTES:,from land to land. Through full speedy messengers he begged and bade to
6617,ENDNOTES:,his high feasting. From this many a one met there his death. The envoys
6618,ENDNOTES:,rode away from the Hunnish land to Burgundy. They were sent thither for
6619,ENDNOTES:,"three noble kings and for their men, that these should come to Etzel;"
6620,ENDNOTES:,"therefore all gan haste. To Bechelaren they came a-riding, where served"
6621,ENDNOTES:,them gladly. Rudeger and Gotelind and the child of them twain delayed
6622,ENDNOTES:,not to send their service through the envoys to the Rhine. Nor did
6623,ENDNOTES:,"they let them part hence without gifts, that Etzel's men might fare"
6624,ENDNOTES:,the better. To Uta and her sons Rudeger sent word that they had no more
6625,ENDNOTES:,"loyal margrave than he. To Brunhild, also, they tendered service and"
6626,ENDNOTES:,"good wishes, constant fealty and a loving mind. When they heard the"
6627,ENDNOTES:,"speech that the envoys would ride, the margravine begged God in heaven"
6628,ENDNOTES:,to keep them well.
6629,ENDNOTES:,
6630,ENDNOTES:,"Before the messengers were quite come through Bavarian land, the doughty"
6631,ENDNOTES:,Werbel sought out the good Bishop Pilgrim. What word he sent to his kin
6632,ENDNOTES:,"upon the Rhine, that I know not, but naught but ruddy gold he gave the"
6633,ENDNOTES:,messengers for love and let them ride.
6634,ENDNOTES:,
6635,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the bishop: ""And might I see them here, my sister's sons, I"
6636,ENDNOTES:,"should be blithe of mood, for full seldom can I come to them upon the"
6637,ENDNOTES:,"Rhine."""
6638,ENDNOTES:,
6639,ENDNOTES:,"What roads they traveled to the Rhine, I cannot tell. None robbed them"
6640,ENDNOTES:,of their silver and their weeds; men feared their master's wrath. Certes
6641,ENDNOTES:,the noble high-born king was a mighty lord.
6642,ENDNOTES:,
6643,ENDNOTES:,"Within a twelfth night Werbel and Swemmel came to the Rhine, to the land"
6644,ENDNOTES:,of Worms. To the kings and their liegemen tidings were told that there
6645,ENDNOTES:,"came strange messengers. Gunther, the lord of the Rhineland, gan ask:"
6646,ENDNOTES:,"""Who will do us to wit, from whence these strangers ride into our land?"""
6647,ENDNOTES:,
6648,ENDNOTES:,"This none wist, till Hagen of Troneg saw them, who then spake to"

6650,ENDNOTES:,King Etzel's minstrels here. Them your sister hath sent to the Rhine;
6651,ENDNOTES:,"for their master's sake we must give them a kindly welcome."""
6652,ENDNOTES:,
6653,ENDNOTES:,Already they were riding up before the palace; never did a prince's
6654,ENDNOTES:,minstrels journey in more lordly wise. Straightway the king's meiny
6655,ENDNOTES:,bade them welcome. Men gave them lodgings and bade take in charge their
6656,ENDNOTES:,trappings. Their traveling clothes were rich and so well fashioned that
6657,ENDNOTES:,"with honor they might come before the king, but they would not wear them"
6658,ENDNOTES:,"longer there at court, and asked if there were any that desired them."
6659,ENDNOTES:,"At the selfsame moment folk were found who fain would take them, and to"
6660,ENDNOTES:,"these they were sent. Then the strangers donned far better weeds, such"
6661,ENDNOTES:,as well befitted king's messengers for to wear.
6662,ENDNOTES:,
6663,ENDNOTES:,Then Etzel's retainers went by leave to where the king was sitting; men
6664,ENDNOTES:,saw this gladly. Hagen sprang courteously towards the messengers and
6665,ENDNOTES:,greeted them in loving wise. For this the squires did say him thanks.
6666,ENDNOTES:,"That he might know their tidings, he gan ask how Etzel fared and all his"
6667,ENDNOTES:,"men. Then spake the minstrel: ""Never did the land stand better, nor were"

6669,ENDNOTES:,
6670,ENDNOTES:,"To the host they went; the hall was full. There men received the guests,"

6696,ENDNOTES:,"very welcome to us. An' ye would ride more often hither to the Rhine,"
6697,ENDNOTES:,ye would find friends here whom ye would be glad to see. Little of harm

6770,ENDNOTES:,"you for a hostage; (1) but if ye will not follow him, Rumolt adviseth"
6771,ENDNOTES:,"you, for I be bound to you in fealty and duty, that for my sake ye abide"
6772,ENDNOTES:,here and leave King Etzel there with Kriemhild. How might it fare more
6773,ENDNOTES:,gently with you in all the world? Ye be well able to stand before your
6774,ENDNOTES:,"foes; so deck your body out with brave attire, drink the best of wine,"
6775,ENDNOTES:,and pay court to stately ladies. Thereto ye be served with the best of
6776,ENDNOTES:,"food that ever king did gain in the world. And were this not so, yet"
6777,ENDNOTES:,"should ye tarry here for your fair wife's sake, before ye risk your life"
6778,ENDNOTES:,so childishly. Wherefore I do counsel you to stay at home. Your lands be
6779,ENDNOTES:,"rich, and one can redeem his pledges better at home than among the Huns."
6780,ENDNOTES:,"Who knoweth how it standeth there? Ye should stay at home, Sire, that is"
6781,ENDNOTES:,"Rumolt's counsel."""
6782,ENDNOTES:,
6783,ENDNOTES:,"""We will not stay,"" quoth Gernot. ""Sith my sister and the mighty Etzel"
6784,ENDNOTES:,"have bidden us in such friendly wise, why should we not accept? He that"
6785,ENDNOTES:,"liketh not to go may stay at home."""
6786,ENDNOTES:,
6787,ENDNOTES:,"To This Hagen answered: ""Take not my speech amiss, however ye may fare."
6788,ENDNOTES:,"In all truth I counsel you, would ye guard your lives, then ride to the"
6789,ENDNOTES:,"Huns well armed. Sith ye will not turn you, send for your men-at-arms,"
6790,ENDNOTES:,the best ye have or can find in any part; from among them all I'll
6791,ENDNOTES:,choose a thousand doughty knights. Then Kriemhild's evil mood can bring
6792,ENDNOTES:,"you naught of harm."""
6793,ENDNOTES:,
6794,ENDNOTES:,"""This rede I'll gladly follow,"" spake straightway the king. He then"
6795,ENDNOTES:,bade messengers ride far and wide throughout his lands. Three thousand
6796,ENDNOTES:,champions or more they fetched. Little they weened to gain such grievous
6797,ENDNOTES:,woe. Full merrily they rode to Gunther's court. Men bade give all that
6798,ENDNOTES:,were to ride forth from Burgundy both steeds and trappings. The king
6799,ENDNOTES:,gained full many a one with willing mood. Then Hagen of Troneg bade his
6800,ENDNOTES:,brother Dankwart lead eighty of their warriors to the Rhine. In knightly
6801,ENDNOTES:,guise they came; these doughty men took with them harness and trappings
6802,ENDNOTES:,"into Gunther's land. Then came bold Folker, a noble minstrel he,"
6803,ENDNOTES:,with thirty of his men for the journey to Kriemhild's court. They had
6804,ENDNOTES:,"clothing such as a king might wear. Gunther bade make known, he would to"
6805,ENDNOTES:,the Hunnish land. I'll do you now to wit who Folker was. He was a noble
6806,ENDNOTES:,"lord, the liege of many doughty knights in Burgundy. A minstrel he was"
6807,ENDNOTES:,"called, for that he wist how to fiddle. Hagen chose a thousand whom"
6808,ENDNOTES:,he well knew; oft had he seen what their hands had wrought in press of
6809,ENDNOTES:,"battle, or in whatever else they did. None might aver aught else of them"
6810,ENDNOTES:,than doughtiness.
6811,ENDNOTES:,
6812,ENDNOTES:,"The tarrying irked Kriemhild's envoys sore, for great was their fear of"
6813,ENDNOTES:,their lord. Daily they craved leave to go; this Hagen would not grant
6814,ENDNOTES:,"through craftiness. To his master he spake: ""We should well guard"
6815,ENDNOTES:,"against letting them ride away, until we ourselves fare forth a sennight"
6816,ENDNOTES:,"later to Etzel's land. If any beareth us ill will, the better shall we"
6817,ENDNOTES:,wot it. Nor may Lady Kriemhild then make ready that through any plan of
6818,ENDNOTES:,"hers, men do us harm. An' this be her will, she'll fare full ill, for"
6819,ENDNOTES:,"many a chosen liegeman had we hence."""
6820,ENDNOTES:,
6821,ENDNOTES:,"Shields and saddles, and all the garments that they would take with them"
6822,ENDNOTES:,"to Etzel's land, were now full ready for many a brave man-at-arms. Now"
6823,ENDNOTES:,men bade Kriemhild's messengers go before King Gunther. When they were
6824,ENDNOTES:,"come, Gernot spake: ""The king will do as Etzel asked us, we will gladly"
6825,ENDNOTES:,"come to his high feast to see our sister; be no more in doubt of that."""
6826,ENDNOTES:,
6827,ENDNOTES:,"Then King Gunther spake: ""Wist ye how to tell us, when this feast shall"
6828,ENDNOTES:,"be, or in what time we should go thither?"""
6829,ENDNOTES:,
6830,ENDNOTES:,"Swemmel replied: ""Of a truth it shall be on next midsummer's day."""
6831,ENDNOTES:,
6832,ENDNOTES:,"The king gave them leave (this had not happed as yet), if they would"
6833,ENDNOTES:,"fain see Lady Brunhild, to go before her with his free will. This Folker"
6834,ENDNOTES:,"hindered, which pleased her much. ""Forsooth, my Lady Brunhild is not"
6835,ENDNOTES:,"so well of mood, that ye may see her,"" spake the good knight. ""Bide the"
6836,ENDNOTES:,"morrow, and men will let you see her."" When they weened to gaze upon"
6837,ENDNOTES:,"her, it might not hap."
6838,ENDNOTES:,
6839,ENDNOTES:,"Then the mighty prince, who liked the envoys well, through his own"
6840,ENDNOTES:,"courtesie, bade his gold be carried forth on the broad shields of which"
6841,ENDNOTES:,he had great store. Rich gifts were also given them by his kinsmen
6842,ENDNOTES:,"Giselher and Gernot, Gere and Ortwin. Well they showed, that they were"
6843,ENDNOTES:,"generous, too. They offered the messengers such rich gifts, that for"
6844,ENDNOTES:,fear of their lord they durst not take them.
6845,ENDNOTES:,
6846,ENDNOTES:,"Now spake the envoy Werbel to the king: ""Sir King, let your gifts stay"
6847,ENDNOTES:,here at home. We may carry none away; our lord forbade that we take
6848,ENDNOTES:,"aught of gifts. Then too, there is but little need."""
6849,ENDNOTES:,
6850,ENDNOTES:,"Then the ruler of the Rhine waxed wroth, that they should thus refuse"
6851,ENDNOTES:,the gifts of so mighty a king. At last they were forced to take his gold
6852,ENDNOTES:,"and weeds, the which they later bare to Etzel's land. They would fain"
6853,ENDNOTES:,"see the Lady Uta, or ever they departed hence, so the doughty Giselher"
6854,ENDNOTES:,"brought the minstrels before his mother Uta. The lady sent the message,"
6855,ENDNOTES:,"that whatever honors her daughter had, this gave her joy. Then the queen"
6856,ENDNOTES:,"bade give the minstrels of her edgings and her gold, for the sake of"
6857,ENDNOTES:,King Etzel and Kriemhild whom she loved. Gladly they took the gifts; in
6858,ENDNOTES:,good faith 'twas done.
6859,ENDNOTES:,
6860,ENDNOTES:,"The messengers had now taken their leave from thence, from wives and"
6861,ENDNOTES:,men. Merrily they rode away to Swabia. Thither Gernot bade his knights
6862,ENDNOTES:,"escort them, that none might do them harm. When they parted from those"
6863,ENDNOTES:,"who should have them in their care, Etzel's power did guard them on all"
6864,ENDNOTES:,"their ways, so that none bereft them of either horse or trappings. With"
6865,ENDNOTES:,great speed they hasted towards Etzel's land. To all the friends they
6866,ENDNOTES:,"wot of, they made known that in a short time the Burgundians would come"
6867,ENDNOTES:,"hither from the Rhine to the Hunnish land. To the Bishop Pilgrim too,"
6868,ENDNOTES:,"the tale was told. As they rode adown the highway before Bechelaren, men"
6869,ENDNOTES:,"delayed not to tell Rudeger and Gotelind, the margrave's wife. Merry she"
6870,ENDNOTES:,grew that she should see them. Men saw the minstrels hasting with the
6871,ENDNOTES:,tidings. They found King Etzel in the town of Gran. (2) Greeting after
6872,ENDNOTES:,"greeting they gave the king, of which full many had been sent him. He"
6873,ENDNOTES:,blushed for very joy.
6874,ENDNOTES:,
6875,ENDNOTES:,"Happy of mood was the queen, when she heard the tale aright that her"
6876,ENDNOTES:,brothers should come into the land. She gave the minstrels great gifts
6877,ENDNOTES:,"as meed. This was done for honor's sake. She spake: ""Now tell me, both"
6878,ENDNOTES:,"of you, Werbel and Swemmel, which of my kin are minded to be at the"
6879,ENDNOTES:,feast? Will the best of those we bade come hither to this land? Pray
6880,ENDNOTES:,"tell me what Hagen said when he heard the tale."""
6881,ENDNOTES:,
6882,ENDNOTES:,"The minstrel answered: ""He came on a morning early to the council,"
6883,ENDNOTES:,and but little of fair speech he spake thereby. When they pledged the
6884,ENDNOTES:,"journey hither to the Hunnish lands, that was as words of death to the"
6885,ENDNOTES:,"wrathful Hagen. Your brothers, the three kings, will come in lordly"
6886,ENDNOTES:,"mood. Whoever else may come, this tale I know not of a surety. The brave"
6887,ENDNOTES:,"minstrel Folker vowed to ride along."""
6888,ENDNOTES:,
6889,ENDNOTES:,"""Little do I reck,"" spake the queen, ""whether I ever see Folker here. Of"

6891,ENDNOTES:,"see him here."""
6892,ENDNOTES:,
6893,ENDNOTES:,Then the queen went to where she saw the king. How lovingly Dame
6894,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild spake: ""How like you these tales, dear my lord? What I have"

6896,ENDNOTES:,
6897,ENDNOTES:,"""Thy wish is my joy,"" spake then the king. ""Never have I been so blithe"

6899,ENDNOTES:,"kindness of thy kinsmen my care hath fled away."""
6900,ENDNOTES:,
6901,ENDNOTES:,King Etzel's officers bade everywhere palace and hall be purveyed with

6916,ENDNOTES:,
6917,ENDNOTES:,Now let us leave the tale of how they lived at Etzel's court. More
6918,ENDNOTES:,high-mettled warriors never rode in such lordly wise to the land of any
6919,ENDNOTES:,"king; they had whatever they listed, both of weapons and of weeds. The"
6920,ENDNOTES:,"ruler of the Rhineland clad his men, a thousand and sixty knights, (1)"
6921,ENDNOTES:,"as I have heard, and nine thousand footmen, for the courtly feast. Those"
6922,ENDNOTES:,they left at home bewailed it in after time. The trappings were now
6923,ENDNOTES:,borne across the court at Worms; then spake an aged bishop from Speyer
6924,ENDNOTES:,"to fair Uta: ""Our friends would journey to the feasting. May God"
6925,ENDNOTES:,"preserve their honor there."""
6926,ENDNOTES:,
6927,ENDNOTES:,"The noble Lady Uta then spake to her sons: ""Pray tarry here, good"
6928,ENDNOTES:,"knights. Me-dreamed last night of direst woe, how all the fowls in this"
6929,ENDNOTES:,"land lay dead."""
6930,ENDNOTES:,
6931,ENDNOTES:,"""Who recketh aught of dreams,"" quoth Hagen, ""he wotteth not how to say"

6933,ENDNOTES:,that my lord go to court to take his leave. We must gladly ride to
6934,ENDNOTES:,Etzel's land. The arms of doughty heroes may serve kings there full
6935,ENDNOTES:,"well, where we shall behold Kriemhild's feast."""
6936,ENDNOTES:,
6937,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen counseled the journey, but later it rued him sore. He would have"
6938,ENDNOTES:,"advised against it, but that Gernot encountered him with such rude"
6939,ENDNOTES:,"words. Of Siegfried, Lady Kriemhild's husband, he minded him; he spake:"
6940,ENDNOTES:,"""Because of him Hagen will not make the journey to the court."""
6941,ENDNOTES:,
6942,ENDNOTES:,"At this Hagen of Troneg spake: ""I do it not from fear. Heroes, when"
6943,ENDNOTES:,"it please you, begin the work. Certes I will gladly ride with you to"
6944,ENDNOTES:,"Etzel's land."" Later he carved to pieces many a helm and shield."
6945,ENDNOTES:,
6946,ENDNOTES:,The skiffs were now made ready; many a knight stood there. Thither men
6947,ENDNOTES:,"bare whatever clothes they had. Busy they were until the even tide, then"
6948,ENDNOTES:,full merrily they set forth from home. Tents and pavilions were raised
6949,ENDNOTES:,"upon the green beyond the Rhine. When this had happed, the king bade"
6950,ENDNOTES:,his fair wife tarry with him. That night she still embraced her stately
6951,ENDNOTES:,"knight. Trumpeting and fluting rose early on the morn, as sign that they"
6952,ENDNOTES:,should ride. Then to the work they went. Whoso held in his arms his love
6953,ENDNOTES:,caressed the fair. Later King Etzel's wife parted them with woe.
6954,ENDNOTES:,
6955,ENDNOTES:,"Fair Uta's sons, they had a liegeman, brave and true. When they would"
6956,ENDNOTES:,"hence, he spake to the king in secret wise his mind. Quoth he: ""I must"
6957,ENDNOTES:,"bewail that ye make this journey to the court."" He was hight Rumolt and"
6958,ENDNOTES:,"was a hero of his hands. He spake: ""To whom will ye leave your folk and"

6961,ENDNOTES:,
6962,ENDNOTES:,"""Be the land and my little child, too, commended to thy care; serve well"

6964,ENDNOTES:,"King Etzel's bride will never do us harm."""
6965,ENDNOTES:,
6966,ENDNOTES:,The steeds were now ready for the kings and their men. Many a one who
6967,ENDNOTES:,"lived there high of spirit, parted thence with loving kisses. This many"
6968,ENDNOTES:,a stately dame must later needs bewail. When the doughty knights were
6969,ENDNOTES:,"seen go toward the steeds, men spied full many ladies standing sadly"
6970,ENDNOTES:,there. Their hearts did tell them that this long parting boded them
6971,ENDNOTES:,great harm. This doth never ease the heart.
6972,ENDNOTES:,
6973,ENDNOTES:,The doughty Burgundians started on their way. Then in the land a mighty
6974,ENDNOTES:,turmoil rose; on either side of the mountains there wept both men and
6975,ENDNOTES:,"wives. But however the folk might bear them, the knights jogged merrily"
6976,ENDNOTES:,"along. With them rode the men of Nibelung, a thousand hauberks strong,"
6977,ENDNOTES:,who had left many comely dames at home whom they never saw again.
6978,ENDNOTES:,Siegfried's wounds gave Kriemhild pain.
6979,ENDNOTES:,
6980,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther's liegemen now wended their way towards the river Main, up"
6981,ENDNOTES:,"through Eastern Frankland. (2) Thither Hagen led them, for well he wot"
6982,ENDNOTES:,"the way. Dankwart was their marshal, the hero from Burgundian land. As"
6983,ENDNOTES:,"they rode away from the Eastern Frankland towards Swanfield, (3) men"
6984,ENDNOTES:,"could tell the princes and their kin, the worshipful knights, by their"
6985,ENDNOTES:,lordly bearing. On the twelfth morning the king came to the Danube.
6986,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen of Troneg rode foremost of them all, giving to the Nibelungs"
6987,ENDNOTES:,helpful cheer. On the sandy shore the bold knight dismounted and bound
6988,ENDNOTES:,"his steed full soon to a tree. The river was swollen, the skiffs hidden"
6989,ENDNOTES:,"away. Great fear the Nibelungs had, as to how they might come across,"
6990,ENDNOTES:,for the stream was much too broad. Full many a lusty knight alighted on
6991,ENDNOTES:,the ground.
6992,ENDNOTES:,
6993,ENDNOTES:,"""Ill may it lightly hap with thee here,"" quoth Hagen, ""O ruler of the"
6994,ENDNOTES:,"Rhine. Now mayst thou thyself see the river is swollen, its flood is"
6995,ENDNOTES:,"mighty. Certes, I ween, we shall lose here many a worthy knight to-day."""
6996,ENDNOTES:,
6997,ENDNOTES:,"""Why dost thou rebuke me, Hagen?"" spake the lordly king. ""For thine own"
6998,ENDNOTES:,"prowess' sake discomfit me no more, but seek us the ford across to the"
6999,ENDNOTES:,"other bank, that we may take hence both steeds and trappings."""
7000,ENDNOTES:,
7001,ENDNOTES:,"""Forsooth,"" quoth Hagen, ""I be not so weary of life, that I would drown"
7002,ENDNOTES:,me in these broad waves. Sooner shall men die by my hands in Etzel's
7003,ENDNOTES:,"lands. That will I well. Stay by the water's side, ye proud knights and"
7004,ENDNOTES:,"good, and I will seek the ferryman myself along the stream, who shall"
7005,ENDNOTES:,"ferry us across to Gelfrat's (4) land."""
7006,ENDNOTES:,
7007,ENDNOTES:,Then the stalwart Hagen seized his good shield. Well was he armed. The
7008,ENDNOTES:,"shield he bare along, his helmet bound upon his head, bright enow it"
7009,ENDNOTES:,was. Above his breastplate he bare a sword so broad that most fiercely
7010,ENDNOTES:,it cut on either edge. To and fro he sought the ferryman. He heard the
7011,ENDNOTES:,splash of water and began to listen. In a fair spring wise women (5)
7012,ENDNOTES:,were bathing for to cool them off. Now Hagen spied them and crept toward
7013,ENDNOTES:,"them stealthily. When they grew ware of this, they hurried fast to"
7014,ENDNOTES:,"escape him; glad enow they were of this. The hero took their clothes,"
7015,ENDNOTES:,but did them naught else of harm.
7016,ENDNOTES:,
7017,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake one of the mermaids (Hadburg she was called): ""Sir Knight"

7020,ENDNOTES:,
7021,ENDNOTES:,Like birds they floated before him on the flood. Therefore him-thought
7022,ENDNOTES:,their senses strong and good; he believed the more what they would tell
7023,ENDNOTES:,"him. Well they answered what he craved of them. Hadburg spake again: ""Ye"
7024,ENDNOTES:,"may safely ride to Etzel's land. I'll stake my troth at once as pledge,"
7025,ENDNOTES:,that heroes never rode better to any realm for such great honors. Now
7026,ENDNOTES:,"believe that in truth."""
7027,ENDNOTES:,
7028,ENDNOTES:,In his heart Hagen was joyous at this rede. He gave them back their
7029,ENDNOTES:,"clothes and no longer tarried. As they donned their strange attire, they"
7030,ENDNOTES:,told him rightly of the journey to Etzel's land. The other mermaid spake
7031,ENDNOTES:,"(Siegelind she hight): ""I will warn thee, Hagen, son of Aldrian. (6) For"
7032,ENDNOTES:,the sake of her weeds mine aunt hath lied to thee. An' thou comest to

7039,ENDNOTES:,
7040,ENDNOTES:,Then gan they tell him the tale still more knowingly. The same one spake
7041,ENDNOTES:,"again: ""It must needs be that none of you shall live, save the king's"
7042,ENDNOTES:,chaplain; this we know full well. He will come again safe and sound to
7043,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther's land."""
7044,ENDNOTES:,
7045,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake bold Hagen, fierce of mood: ""It were not well to tell my"

7048,ENDNOTES:,
7049,ENDNOTES:,"She answered: ""Sith ye will not turn you from the journey, up yonder"

7052,ENDNOTES:,
7053,ENDNOTES:,At once he ceased to ask for further tidings. After the angry warrior
7054,ENDNOTES:,"she called: ""Pray bide a time, Sir Hagen! Forsooth ye are too much in"
7055,ENDNOTES:,haste. List further to the tale of how ye may cross to the other bank.
7056,ENDNOTES:,The lord of these marches beareth the name of Else. (7) His brother is

7066,ENDNOTES:,
7067,ENDNOTES:,"Haughty Hagen bowed then to the dames; he spake no more, but held his"
7068,ENDNOTES:,"peace. Then by the river he hied him higher up upon the sandy shore,"
7069,ENDNOTES:,to where he found an inn upon the other bank. Loudly he began to call
7070,ENDNOTES:,"across the flood: ""Now come and fetch me, ferryman,"" quoth the good"
7071,ENDNOTES:,"knight, ""and I will give thee as meed an arm ring of ruddy gold. Know,"

7073,ENDNOTES:,
7074,ENDNOTES:,"So noble was the ferryman that it behooved him not to serve, therefore"

7077,ENDNOTES:,"He called with might and main, that all the water rang, for mickle and"
7078,ENDNOTES:,"great was the hero's strength. ""Now fetch me. I am Amelrich, Else's"

7083,ENDNOTES:,"The haughty ferryman, the which was newly wed himself, did take the oar"
7084,ENDNOTES:,"in hand. As he would earn Hagen's gold so red, therefore he died the"
7085,ENDNOTES:,sword-grim death at the hands of the knight. The greed for great goods
7086,ENDNOTES:,(10) doth give an evil end. Speedily the boatman rowed across to the

7096,ENDNOTES:,
7097,ENDNOTES:,"The ferryman replied: ""This may not be. My dear lords have foes,"

7100,ENDNOTES:,
7101,ENDNOTES:,"""Now do it not,"" spake Hagen; ""sad is my mind. Take this good gold from"

7104,ENDNOTES:,
7105,ENDNOTES:,"The grim boatman answered: ""'Twill ne'er be done."" He raised a mighty"
7106,ENDNOTES:,"rudder oar, mickle and broad, and struck at Hagen (full wroth he grew"
7107,ENDNOTES:,"at this), so that he fell upon his knees in the boat. The lord of Troneg"
7108,ENDNOTES:,had never met so fierce a ferryman. Still more the boatman would vex the
7109,ENDNOTES:,"haughty stranger. He smote with an oar, so that it quite to-broke (11)"

7111,ENDNOTES:,"Else took great harm. Hagen, fierce of mood, seized straightway his"

7113,ENDNOTES:,it on the ground. Eftsoon these tidings were made known to the proud
7114,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundians. At the very moment that he slew the boatman, the skiff gan"
7115,ENDNOTES:,drifting down the stream. Enow that irked him. Weary he grew before he
7116,ENDNOTES:,brought it back. King Gunther's liegeman pulled with might and main.

7118,ENDNOTES:,snapped in his hand. He would hence to the knights out upon the shore.
7119,ENDNOTES:,"None other oar he had. Ho, how quickly he bound it with a shield strap,"
7120,ENDNOTES:,"a narrow band! Towards a wood he floated down the stream, where he found"
7121,ENDNOTES:,his sovran standing by the shore.
7122,ENDNOTES:,
7123,ENDNOTES:,Many a stately man went down to meet him. The doughty knights and good
7124,ENDNOTES:,received him with a kindly greeting. When they beheld in the skiff the
7125,ENDNOTES:,"blood reeking from a gaping wound which he had dealt the ferryman, Hagen"
7126,ENDNOTES:,was plied enow with questions by the knights. When that King Gunther
7127,ENDNOTES:,"spied the hot blood swirling in the skiff, how quickly he spake:"
7128,ENDNOTES:,"""Wherefore tell ye me not, Hagen, whither the ferryman be come? I ween"

7150,ENDNOTES:,"unknown land. First he took across a thousand noble knights, then his"
7151,ENDNOTES:,own men-at-arms. Still there were more to come. Nine thousand footmen he
7152,ENDNOTES:,ferried over to the land. Aught but idle was Hagen's hand that day. When

7154,ENDNOTES:,good bethought him of the strange tales which the wild mermaids had told

7156,ENDNOTES:,"found the priest close by the chapel luggage, leaning with his hand upon"

7170,ENDNOTES:,"he turned him back again. Sore was he discomfited, but though he could"

7177,ENDNOTES:,When the liegemen of the three kings unloaded the skiff and had borne

7284,ENDNOTES:,
7285,ENDNOTES:,"Ere the wish was fully spoken, men saw the doughty fiddler standing"

7289,ENDNOTES:,
7290,ENDNOTES:,Trustworthy tidings of the ferryman's death were now come to Gelfrat's

7293,ENDNOTES:,"time, as I'll let you hear, one saw riding towards them those who"
7294,ENDNOTES:,had wrought scathe and monstrous wounds in mighty battles. Full seven
7295,ENDNOTES:,hundred or more were come to Gelfrat. When they began to ride after
7296,ENDNOTES:,"their savage foes, their lords did lead them, of a truth. A deal too"
7297,ENDNOTES:,strong they hasted after the valiant strangers; they would avenge their
7298,ENDNOTES:,wrath. Therefore many of the lordings' friends were later lost.
7299,ENDNOTES:,
7300,ENDNOTES:,Hagen of Troneg had well planned it (how might a hero ever guard his
7301,ENDNOTES:,"kinsmen better), that he had in charge the rear guard, with his liegemen"
7302,ENDNOTES:,and his brother Dankwart. This was wisely done.
7303,ENDNOTES:,
7304,ENDNOTES:,The day had passed away; the night was come. For his friends he feared
7305,ENDNOTES:,"both harm and woe, as beneath their shields they rode through the"
7306,ENDNOTES:,Bavarian land. A short time thereafter the heroes were assailed. On
7307,ENDNOTES:,either side of the highway and in the rear hard by they heard the beat
7308,ENDNOTES:,of hoofs. Their foes pressed on too hard. Then spake hold Dankwart:

7311,ENDNOTES:,
7312,ENDNOTES:,"They stayed their journey, as though it must needs he; in the gloom"

7314,ENDNOTES:,"peace; he called: ""Who chaseth us upon the highway?"""
7315,ENDNOTES:,
7316,ENDNOTES:,To this Gelfrat must needs give answer. Quoth the margrave of Bavaria:
7317,ENDNOTES:,"""We seek our foes and have galloped on behind you. I know not who slew"
7318,ENDNOTES:,"my ferryman to-day, but it doth rue me enow, for he was a hero of his"

7320,ENDNOTES:,
7321,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Hagen of Troneg: ""And was then the ferryman thine? The fault"

7324,ENDNOTES:,"offered him gold and trappings, that he ferry me across to thy land, Sir"
7325,ENDNOTES:,Knight. This angered him so greatly that he smote me with a mighty oar.
7326,ENDNOTES:,At this I waxed grim enow. I seized my sword and fended him his anger

7334,ENDNOTES:,Over the bucklers Gelfrat and Hagen couched their spears for the thrust;

7337,ENDNOTES:,prove each other better? From a mighty thrust Hagen was unhorsed by
7338,ENDNOTES:,"Gelfrat's hand. His martingale snapped, he learnt what it was to fall."
7339,ENDNOTES:,"The crash of shafts resounded from their fellowship. Hagen, who from the"
7340,ENDNOTES:,"thrust afore had come to earth, down on the grass, sprang up again. I"

7342,ENDNOTES:,"steeds, I know not; both Hagen and Gelfrat had alighted on the sand and"
7343,ENDNOTES:,rushed together. Their fellowship helped thereby and became acquaint
7344,ENDNOTES:,"with strife. Albeit Hagen sprang at Gelfrat fiercely, the noble margrave"
7345,ENDNOTES:,"smote from his shield a mickle piece, so that the sparks flew wide. Full"
7346,ENDNOTES:,nigh did Gunther's liegeman die therefrom. He began to call to Dankwart:
7347,ENDNOTES:,"""O help, dear brother! Certes, a hero of his hands hath matched me, he"

7415,ENDNOTES:,"warriors had rested them and came nearer to the Hunnish land, they found"
7416,ENDNOTES:,"a man asleep upon the border, from whom Hagen of Troneg won a sturdy"
7417,ENDNOTES:,sword. The same good knight hight Eckewart (3) in truth; sad of mood he
7418,ENDNOTES:,"grew, that he lost his weapon through the journey of the knights. They"
7419,ENDNOTES:,found Rudeger's marches guarded ill.
7420,ENDNOTES:,
7421,ENDNOTES:,"""Woe is me of this shame,"" spake Eckewart. ""Certes this journey of the"
7422,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundians rueth me full sore. My joy hath fled, sith I lost Knight"
7423,ENDNOTES:,"Siegfried. Alas, Sir Rudeger, how I have acted toward thee!"""
7424,ENDNOTES:,
7425,ENDNOTES:,"When Hagen heard the noble warrior's plight, he gave him back his sword"
7426,ENDNOTES:,"and six red arm bands. ""These keep, Sir Knight, as a token that thou art"
7427,ENDNOTES:,"my friend. A bold knight thou art, though thou standest alone upon the"
7428,ENDNOTES:,"marches."""
7429,ENDNOTES:,
7430,ENDNOTES:,"""God repay you for your arm bands,"" Eckewart replied. ""Yet your journey"
7431,ENDNOTES:,"to the Huns doth rue me sore. Because ye slew Siegfried, men hate you"
7432,ENDNOTES:,"here. I counsel you in truth, that ye guard you well."""
7433,ENDNOTES:,
7434,ENDNOTES:,"""Now may God protect us,"" answered Hagen. ""These knights, the kings and"
7435,ENDNOTES:,"their liegemen, have forsooth no other care, save for their lodgement,"
7436,ENDNOTES:,where we may find quarters in this land to-night. Our steeds be spent by
7437,ENDNOTES:,"the distant way and our food run out,"" quoth Hagen, the knight. ""We"
7438,ENDNOTES:,"find naught anywhere for sale, and have need of a host, who through his"
7439,ENDNOTES:,"courtesie would give us of his bread to-night."""
7440,ENDNOTES:,
7441,ENDNOTES:,"Then Eckewart made answer: ""I'll show you a host so good that full"
7442,ENDNOTES:,"seldom have ye been lodged so well in any land, as here may hap you, an'"
7443,ENDNOTES:,"ye will seek out Rudeger, ye doughty knights. He dwelleth by the highway"
7444,ENDNOTES:,and is the best host that ever owned a house. His heart giveth birth to
7445,ENDNOTES:,"courtesie, as the sweet May doth to grass and flowers. He is aye merry"
7446,ENDNOTES:,"of mood, when he can serve good knights."""
7447,ENDNOTES:,
7448,ENDNOTES:,"At this King Gunther spake: ""Will ye be my messenger and ask whether my"
7449,ENDNOTES:,"dear friend Rudeger will for my sake keep us, my kinsmen and our men? I"
7450,ENDNOTES:,"will repay thee this, as best I ever can."""
7451,ENDNOTES:,
7452,ENDNOTES:,"""Gladly will I be the messenger,"" Eckewart replied. With a right good"
7453,ENDNOTES:,"will he gat him on the road and told Rudeger the message he had heard,"
7454,ENDNOTES:,to whom none such pleasing news had come in many a day.
7455,ENDNOTES:,
7456,ENDNOTES:,At Bechelaren men saw a knight pricking fast. Rudeger himself descried
7457,ENDNOTES:,"him; he spake: ""Upon the road yonder hasteth Eckewart, a liegeman of"
7458,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild."""
7459,ENDNOTES:,
7460,ENDNOTES:,He weened the foes had done him scathe. Before the gate he went to meet
7461,ENDNOTES:,"the messenger, who ungirt his sword and laid it from his hand. The"
7462,ENDNOTES:,"tales he brought were not hidden from the host and his friends, but were"
7463,ENDNOTES:,"straightway told them. To the margrave he spake: ""Gunther, the lord of"
7464,ENDNOTES:,"the Burgundian land, and Giselher, his brother, and Gernot, too, have"
7465,ENDNOTES:,sent me hither to you. Each of the warriors tendered you his service.
7466,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen and Folker, too, eagerly did the same in truth. Still more I'll"
7467,ENDNOTES:,"tell you, that the king's marshal sendeth you by me the message, that"
7468,ENDNOTES:,"the good knights have passing need of your lodgement."""
7469,ENDNOTES:,
7470,ENDNOTES:,"Rudeger answered with a smile: ""Now well is me of these tales, that"
7471,ENDNOTES:,the high-born kings do reck of my service. It shall not be denied them.
7472,ENDNOTES:,"Merry and blithe will I be, an' they come unto my house."""
7473,ENDNOTES:,
7474,ENDNOTES:,"""Dankwart, the marshal, bade let you know whom ye should lodge in your"

7477,ENDNOTES:,
7478,ENDNOTES:,"Merry of mood grew Rudeger; he spake: ""Now well is me of these guests,"

7482,ENDNOTES:,
7483,ENDNOTES:,Knights and squires now hied them to their horses; it thought them

7515,ENDNOTES:,
7516,ENDNOTES:,"Then the margrave went to where he found the ladies, his wife with his"
7517,ENDNOTES:,"daughter, and told them straightway the pleasing tidings he had heard,"
7518,ENDNOTES:,that the brothers of their lady were coming thither to their house.
7519,ENDNOTES:,"""My dearest love,"" quoth Rudeger, ""ye must receive full well the noble"
7520,ENDNOTES:,"high-born kings, when they come here to court with their fellowship. Ye"
7521,ENDNOTES:,"must give fair greeting, too, to Hagen, Gunther's man. With them there"
7522,ENDNOTES:,"cometh one also, hight Dankwart; the other is named Folker, well beseen"
7523,ENDNOTES:,with courtesie. Ye and my daughter must kiss these and abide by the
7524,ENDNOTES:,"knights with gentle breeding."" This the ladies vowed; quite ready they"
7525,ENDNOTES:,were to do it. From the chests they hunted out the lordly robes in which
7526,ENDNOTES:,they would go to meet the warriors. Fair dames were passing busy on
7527,ENDNOTES:,that day. Men saw but little of false colors on the ladies' cheeks;
7528,ENDNOTES:,upon their heads they wore bright bands of gold. Rich chaplets (1) these
7529,ENDNOTES:,"were, that the winds might not dishevel their comely hair, and this is"
7530,ENDNOTES:,true i' faith.
7531,ENDNOTES:,
7532,ENDNOTES:,Let us now leave the ladies with these tasks. Much hasting over the
7533,ENDNOTES:,"plain was done by Rudeger's friends, to where one found the lordings,"
7534,ENDNOTES:,"whom men then received well into the margrave's land. When the margrave,"
7535,ENDNOTES:,"the doughty Rudeger, saw them coming toward him, how joyfully he spake:"
7536,ENDNOTES:,"""Be ye welcome, fair sirs, and your liegemen, too. I be fain to see you"
7537,ENDNOTES:,"in my land."" Low obeisance the knights then made, in good faith, without"
7538,ENDNOTES:,"all hate. That he bare them all good will, he showed full well. Hagen"
7539,ENDNOTES:,"he gave a special greeting, for him had he known of yore. (2) To Folker"
7540,ENDNOTES:,"from Burgundy land he did the same. Dankwart he welcomed, too. The bold"
7541,ENDNOTES:,"knight spake: ""Sith ye will purvey us knights, who shall have a care for"
7542,ENDNOTES:,"our men-at-arms whom we have brought?"""
7543,ENDNOTES:,
7544,ENDNOTES:,"Quoth the margrave: ""A good night shall ye have and all your fellowship."
7545,ENDNOTES:,"I'll purvey such guard for whatever ye have brought with you, of steeds"
7546,ENDNOTES:,"and trappings, that naught shall be lost, that might bring you harm, not"
7547,ENDNOTES:,even a single spur. Ye footmen pitch the tents upon the plain. What ye
7548,ENDNOTES:,"lose I'll pay in full. Take off the bridles, let the horses run."""
7549,ENDNOTES:,
7550,ENDNOTES:,Seldom had host done this for them afore. Therefore the guests made
7551,ENDNOTES:,"merry. When that was done, the lordings rode away and the footmen laid"
7552,ENDNOTES:,"them everywhere upon the grass. Good ease they had; I ween, they never"
7553,ENDNOTES:,fared so gently on the way. The noble margravine with her fair daughter
7554,ENDNOTES:,was come out before the castle. One saw stand by her side the lovely
7555,ENDNOTES:,ladies and many a comely maid. Great store of armlets and princely
7556,ENDNOTES:,robes they wore. The precious stones gleamed afar from out their passing
7557,ENDNOTES:,costly weeds. Fair indeed were they fashioned.
7558,ENDNOTES:,
7559,ENDNOTES:,"Then came the guests and alighted there straightway. Ho, what great"
7560,ENDNOTES:,courtesie one found among the Burgundian men! Six and thirty maids and
7561,ENDNOTES:,"many other dames, whose persons were wrought as fair as heart could"
7562,ENDNOTES:,"wish, went forth to meet them with many a valiant man. Fair greetings"
7563,ENDNOTES:,were given there by noble dames. The young margravine kissed all three
7564,ENDNOTES:,"kings, as did her mother, too. Close at hand stood Hagen. Her father"
7565,ENDNOTES:,"bade her kiss him, but when she gazed upon him, he seemed so fearful"
7566,ENDNOTES:,that she had fain left it undone. Yet she must needs perform what the
7567,ENDNOTES:,"host now bade her do. Her color changed first pale then red. Dankwart,"
7568,ENDNOTES:,"too, she kissed, and then the minstrel. For his great prowess was this"
7569,ENDNOTES:,greeting given. The young margravine took by the hand Knight Giselher
7570,ENDNOTES:,"of the Burgundian land. The same her mother did to Gunther, the valiant"
7571,ENDNOTES:,man. Full merrily they went hence with the heroes. The host walked at
7572,ENDNOTES:,"Gernot's side into a broad hall, where the knights and ladies sate them"
7573,ENDNOTES:,"down. Soon they bade pour out for the guests good wine. Certes, heroes"
7574,ENDNOTES:,might never be better purveyed than they. Rudeger's daughter was gazed
7575,ENDNOTES:,"upon with loving glances, so fair she was. Forsooth many a good knight"
7576,ENDNOTES:,"caressed her in his mind. And well did she deserve this, so high she was"
7577,ENDNOTES:,"of mood. The knights thought what they would, but it might not come to"
7578,ENDNOTES:,pass. Back and forth shot the glances at maids and dames. Of them sate
7579,ENDNOTES:,there enow. The noble fiddler bare the host good will.
7580,ENDNOTES:,
7581,ENDNOTES:,"Then they parted after the custom, knights and ladies going to different"
7582,ENDNOTES:,sides. In the broad hall they set up the tables and served the strangers
7583,ENDNOTES:,in lordly wise. For the sake of the guests the noble margravine went
7584,ENDNOTES:,"to table, but let her daughter stay with the maidens, where she sate by"
7585,ENDNOTES:,"right. The guests saw naught of her, which irked them sore, in truth."
7586,ENDNOTES:,
7587,ENDNOTES:,"When they had eaten and drunk on every side, men brought the fair again"
7588,ENDNOTES:,into the hall; nor were merry speeches left unsaid. Many such spake
7589,ENDNOTES:,"Folker, this brave and lusty knight. Before them all the noble minstrel"
7590,ENDNOTES:,"spake: ""Mighty margrave, God hath dealt full graciously with you, for"
7591,ENDNOTES:,he hath given you a passing comely wife and thereto a life of joy. An'
7592,ENDNOTES:,"I were a prince,"" quoth the minstrel, ""and should wear a crown, I would"
7593,ENDNOTES:,fain have to wife your comely daughter. This my heart doth wish. She is
7594,ENDNOTES:,"lovely for to see, thereto noble and good."""
7595,ENDNOTES:,
7596,ENDNOTES:,"Then answered the margrave: ""How might that be, that king should ever"
7597,ENDNOTES:,crave the dear daughter of mine? My wife and I are exiles; what booteth
7598,ENDNOTES:,"in such ease the maiden's passing comeliness?"""
7599,ENDNOTES:,
7600,ENDNOTES:,"To this Gernot, the well-bred man, made answer: ""An' I might have a love"
7601,ENDNOTES:,"after mine own desire, I should be ever glad of such a wife."""
7602,ENDNOTES:,
7603,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen, too, replied in full kindly wise: ""My lord Giselher must take"
7604,ENDNOTES:,a wife. The margravine is of such high kin that I and all his liegemen
7605,ENDNOTES:,"would gladly serve her, should she wear a crown in Burgundy land."""
7606,ENDNOTES:,
7607,ENDNOTES:,"This speech thought Rudeger passing good, and Gotelind too, indeed"
7608,ENDNOTES:,it joyed their mood. Then the heroes brought to pass that the noble
7609,ENDNOTES:,"Giselher took her to wife, as did well befit a king. Who may part what"
7610,ENDNOTES:,"shall be joined together? Men prayed the margravine to go to court, and"
7611,ENDNOTES:,"swore to give him the winsome maid. He, too, vowed to wed the lovely"
7612,ENDNOTES:,"fair. For the maiden they set castles and land aside, and this the hand"
7613,ENDNOTES:,"of the noble king did pledge with an oath, and Lord Gernot, too, that"
7614,ENDNOTES:,this should hap.
7615,ENDNOTES:,
7616,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the margrave: ""Sith I have naught of castles, I will"
7617,ENDNOTES:,ever serve you with my troth. As much silver and gold will I give my
7618,ENDNOTES:,"daughter, as an hundred sumpters may barely carry, that it may please"
7619,ENDNOTES:,"the hero's kin in honor."""
7620,ENDNOTES:,
7621,ENDNOTES:,After the custom men bade them stand in a ring. Over against her many a
7622,ENDNOTES:,"youth stood, blithe of mood. In their minds they harbored thoughts,"
7623,ENDNOTES:,as young folk still are wont to do. Men then gan ask the winsome maid
7624,ENDNOTES:,"whether she would have the knight or no. Loth in part she was, and yet"
7625,ENDNOTES:,"she thought to take the stately man. She shamed her of the question, as"
7626,ENDNOTES:,many another maid hath done. Her father Rudeger counseled her to answer
7627,ENDNOTES:,"yes, and gladly take him. In a trice young Giselher was at her side, and"
7628,ENDNOTES:,"clasped her in his white hands, albeit but little time she might enjoy"
7629,ENDNOTES:,him.
7630,ENDNOTES:,
7631,ENDNOTES:,"Then Spake the margrave: ""Ye noble and mighty kings, when ye now ride"
7632,ENDNOTES:,"again (that is the custom) home to Burgundy, I will give you my child,"
7633,ENDNOTES:,"that ye may take her with you."""
7634,ENDNOTES:,
7635,ENDNOTES:,This then they vowed. Now men must needs give over all the noisy joy.
7636,ENDNOTES:,"They bade the maiden hie her to her bower, and bade the guests to sleep"
7637,ENDNOTES:,and rest them against the day. Meanwhile men made ready the food; the
7638,ENDNOTES:,host purveyed them well.
7639,ENDNOTES:,
7640,ENDNOTES:,"When now they had eaten, they would ride hence to the Hunnish lands."
7641,ENDNOTES:,"""I'll guard against that well,"" spake the noble host. ""Ye must tarry"
7642,ENDNOTES:,"still, for full seldom have I gained such welcome guests."""
7643,ENDNOTES:,
7644,ENDNOTES:,"To this Dankwart replied: ""Forsooth this may not be. Where would ye find"
7645,ENDNOTES:,"the food, the bread and wine, that ye must have for so many warriors"
7646,ENDNOTES:,"another night?"""
7647,ENDNOTES:,
7648,ENDNOTES:,"When the host heard this, he spake: ""Give o'er this speech. My dear"
7649,ENDNOTES:,"lords, ye must not say me nay. Forsooth I'd give you vittaile for a"
7650,ENDNOTES:,"fortnight, with all your fellowship that is come hither with you. King"
7651,ENDNOTES:,"Etzel hath taken from me as yet full little of my goods."""
7652,ENDNOTES:,
7653,ENDNOTES:,"However much they demurred, still they must needs tarry there until the"
7654,ENDNOTES:,"fourth morning, when such deeds were done by the bounty of the host that"
7655,ENDNOTES:,it was told after. He gave his guests both mounts and robes. No longer
7656,ENDNOTES:,"might they stay, they must fare forth. Through his bounty bold Rudeger"
7657,ENDNOTES:,"wot how to save but little. Naught was denied that any craved, it could"
7658,ENDNOTES:,not but please them all. Their noble meiny now brought saddled before
7659,ENDNOTES:,"the gate the many steeds, and to them came forth thee stranger knights."
7660,ENDNOTES:,"In their hands they bare their shields, for they would ride to Etzel's"
7661,ENDNOTES:,"land. Before the noble guests come forth from the hall, the host had"
7662,ENDNOTES:,"proffered everywhere his gifts. He wist how to live bountifully, in"
7663,ENDNOTES:,"mickle honors. To Giselher he had given his comely daughter; to Gunther,"
7664,ENDNOTES:,"the worshipful knight, who seldom took a gift, he gave a coat of mail,"
7665,ENDNOTES:,which the noble and mighty king wore well with honor. Gunther bowed low
7666,ENDNOTES:,"over noble Rudeger's hand. Then to Gernot he gave a weapon good enow,"
7667,ENDNOTES:,the which he later bare full gloriously in strife. Little did the
7668,ENDNOTES:,"margrave's wife begrudge him the gift, but through it good Rudeger was"
7669,ENDNOTES:,"forced to lose his life. Gotelind offered Hagen a loving gift, as well"
7670,ENDNOTES:,"befit her. He took it, sith the king had taken one, that he should"
7671,ENDNOTES:,"not fare forth from her to the feasting, without her present. Later he"
7672,ENDNOTES:,"gainsayed it. ""Of all that I have ever seen,"" quoth Hagen, ""I crave to"
7673,ENDNOTES:,bear naught else save that shield on yonder wall; fain would I take that
7674,ENDNOTES:,"with me into Etzel's land."""
7675,ENDNOTES:,
7676,ENDNOTES:,"When the margravine heard Hagen's speech, it minded her of her"
7677,ENDNOTES:,grief--tears became her well. She thought full dearly on Nudung's (3)
7678,ENDNOTES:,"death, whom Wittich had slain; from this she felt the stress of sorrow."
7679,ENDNOTES:,"To the knight she spake: ""I'll give you the shield. Would to God in"
7680,ENDNOTES:,"heaven, that he still lived who bare it once in hand. He met his death"
7681,ENDNOTES:,"in battle; for him must I ever weep, which giveth me, poor wife, dire"
7682,ENDNOTES:,"woe."""
7683,ENDNOTES:,
7684,ENDNOTES:,The noble margravine rose from her seat and with her white hands she
7685,ENDNOTES:,"seized the shield. To Hagen the lady bare it, who took it in his hand."
7686,ENDNOTES:,This gift was worthily bestowed upon the knight. A cover of shining silk
7687,ENDNOTES:,"concealed its colors, for it was set with precious stones. In sooth the"
7688,ENDNOTES:,daylight never shone on better shield. Had any wished to buy it at its
7689,ENDNOTES:,"cost, 'twere well worth a thousand marks. (4) Hagen bade the shield be"
7690,ENDNOTES:,borne away.
7691,ENDNOTES:,
7692,ENDNOTES:,Then Dankwart came to court. To him the margrave's daughter gave great
7693,ENDNOTES:,"store of rich apparel, the which he later wore among the Huns in passing"
7694,ENDNOTES:,"lordly wise. However many gifts were taken by them, naught would have"
7695,ENDNOTES:,"come into the hands of any, save through the kindness of the host,"
7696,ENDNOTES:,who proffered them so fair. Later they became such foes that they were
7697,ENDNOTES:,forced to strike him dead.
7698,ENDNOTES:,
7699,ENDNOTES:,Now the doughty Folker went courteously with his fiddle and stood before
7700,ENDNOTES:,Gotelind. He played sweet tunes and sang to her his songs. Thus he took
7701,ENDNOTES:,his leave and parted from Bechelaren. The margravine bade fetch a chest.
7702,ENDNOTES:,Now hear the tale of friendly gifts! Twelve rings she took out and
7703,ENDNOTES:,"placed them on his hand. ""These ye must bear hence to Etzel's land and"
7704,ENDNOTES:,"wear them at court for my sake, whithersoever ye turn, that men may tell"
7705,ENDNOTES:,"me how ye have served me yonder at the feast."" What the lady craved, he"
7706,ENDNOTES:,later carried out full well.
7707,ENDNOTES:,
7708,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the host to his guests: ""Ye shall journey all the gentlier,"
7709,ENDNOTES:,"for I myself will guide you and bid guard you well, that none may harm"
7710,ENDNOTES:,"you on the road."""
7711,ENDNOTES:,
7712,ENDNOTES:,Then his sumpters were laden soon. The host was well beseen with five
7713,ENDNOTES:,hundred men with steeds and vesture. These he took with him full
7714,ENDNOTES:,merrily hence to the feasting. Not one of them later ever came alive
7715,ENDNOTES:,to Bechelaren. With a loving kiss the host parted hence; the same did
7716,ENDNOTES:,"Giselher, as his gentle breeding counseled him. In their arms they"
7717,ENDNOTES:,clasped fair wives. This many a high-born maid must needs bewail in
7718,ENDNOTES:,"later times. On every side they opened the casements, for the host with"
7719,ENDNOTES:,his liegemen would now mount their steeds. I ween their hearts did tell
7720,ENDNOTES:,them of the bitter woes to come. Then wept many a dame and many a comely
7721,ENDNOTES:,"maid. They pined for their dear kinsmen, whom nevermore they saw in"
7722,ENDNOTES:,"Bechelaren. Yet these rode merrily across the sand, down along the"
7723,ENDNOTES:,Danube to the Hunnish land.
7724,ENDNOTES:,
7725,ENDNOTES:,"Then noble Rudeger, the full lusty knight, spake to the Burgundians:"
7726,ENDNOTES:,"""Certes, the tidings that we be coming to the Huns must not be left"
7727,ENDNOTES:,"unsaid, for king Etzel hath never heard aught that pleased him more."""
7728,ENDNOTES:,
7729,ENDNOTES:,"So down through Austria the envoy sped, and to the folk on every side"
7730,ENDNOTES:,'twas told that the heroes were coming from Worms beyond the Rhine.
7731,ENDNOTES:,Naught could have been liefer to the courtiers of the king. On before
7732,ENDNOTES:,"the envoys hasted with the tidings, that the Nibelungs were already in"
7733,ENDNOTES:,the Hunnish land.
7734,ENDNOTES:,
7735,ENDNOTES:,"""Thou must greet them well, Kriemhild, lady mine. Thy dear brothers be"

7761,ENDNOTES:,
7762,ENDNOTES:,"When the Burgundians were come to the land, old Hildebrand (1) of Berne"
7763,ENDNOTES:,"did hear the tale, and sore it rued him. He told his lord, who bade him"

7765,ENDNOTES:,"fetch the steeds; then many a sturdy warrior rode with Dietrich, to"
7766,ENDNOTES:,where he thought to meet them on the plain where they had pitched full
7767,ENDNOTES:,"many a lordly tent. When Hagen of Troneg saw them riding from afar, to"
7768,ENDNOTES:,"his lords he spake in courteous wise: ""Now must ye doughty warriors rise"
7769,ENDNOTES:,"from your seats and go to meet them, who would greet you here. Yonder"
7770,ENDNOTES:,"cometh a fellowship I know full well, they be full speedy knights from"

7773,ENDNOTES:,
7774,ENDNOTES:,"Then with Dietrich there alighted from the steeds, as was mickle right,"
7775,ENDNOTES:,"many a knight and squire. Towards the strangers they went, to where"
7776,ENDNOTES:,they found the heroes; in friendly wise they greeted those from the
7777,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land. Ye may now hear what Sir Dietrich said to the sons of
7778,ENDNOTES:,"Uta, as he saw them coming toward him. Their journey rued him sore; he"
7779,ENDNOTES:,"weened that Rudeger wist it, and had told them the tale. ""Be ye welcome,"
7780,ENDNOTES:,"fair sirs, Gunther and Giselher, Gernot and Hagen, likewise Folker and"
7781,ENDNOTES:,the doughty Dankwart. Know ye not that Kriemhild still mourneth sorely

7783,ENDNOTES:,
7784,ENDNOTES:,"""Let her weep long time,"" quoth Hagen. ""He hath lain these many years,"

7811,ENDNOTES:,
7812,ENDNOTES:,The brave Burgundians now rode to court. In lordly wise they came after
7813,ENDNOTES:,the fashion of their land. Many a brave man among the Huns wondered what
7814,ENDNOTES:,"manner of man Hagen of Troneg be. It was enough that men told tales,"
7815,ENDNOTES:,that he had slain Kriemhild's husband the mightiest of all heroes. For
7816,ENDNOTES:,that cause alone much questioning about Hagen was heard at court. The
7817,ENDNOTES:,"knight was fair of stature, that is full true; broad he was across the"
7818,ENDNOTES:,"breast; his hair was mixed with gray; his legs were long, and fierce his"
7819,ENDNOTES:,glance; lordly gait he had.
7820,ENDNOTES:,
7821,ENDNOTES:,"Then one bade lodge the Burgundian men, but Gunther's fellowship was"

7824,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen's brother, he was marshal. The king earnestly commended to him his"

7828,ENDNOTES:,Giselher alone she kissed and took by the hand. That Hagen of Troneg
7829,ENDNOTES:,"saw, and bound his helmet tighter. ""After such a greeting,"" quoth Hagen,"
7830,ENDNOTES:,"""doughty knights may well bethink them. One giveth kings a greeting"

7939,ENDNOTES:,
7940,ENDNOTES:,"Then the two worshipful warriors parted, Hagen of Troneg and"
7941,ENDNOTES:,Sir Dietrich. Over his shoulder Gunther's liegeman gazed for a
7942,ENDNOTES:,"comrade-at-arms, whom he then quickly won. Folker he saw, the cunning"
7943,ENDNOTES:,"fiddler, stand by Giselher, and begged him to join him, for well he knew"
7944,ENDNOTES:,his savage mood. He was in all things a bold knight and a good. Still
7945,ENDNOTES:,"they let the lordings stand in the court, only these twain alone men saw"
7946,ENDNOTES:,walk hence far across the court before a spacious palace. These chosen
7947,ENDNOTES:,warriors feared the hate of none. They sate them down upon a bench
7948,ENDNOTES:,"before the house over against a hall, the which belonged to Kriemhild."
7949,ENDNOTES:,Upon their bodies shone their lordly weeds. Enow who gazed upon them
7950,ENDNOTES:,would than have known the knights; as wild beasts the haughty heroes
7951,ENDNOTES:,"were stared upon by the Hunnish men. Etzel's wife, too, gazed upon"
7952,ENDNOTES:,"them through a window, at which fair Kriemhild waxed sad again. Of her"
7953,ENDNOTES:,sorrows it minded her and she began to weep. Much it wondered Etzel's
7954,ENDNOTES:,"men what had so quickly saddened her mood. Quoth she: ""That Hagen hath"

7956,ENDNOTES:,

8019,ENDNOTES:,
8020,ENDNOTES:,Haughty Hagen laid across his knees a gleaming sword from whose pommel
8021,ENDNOTES:,"a sparkling jasper, greener than grass, did shine. Its hilt was golden,"
8022,ENDNOTES:,"its sheath an edging of red. That it was Siegfried's, Kriemhild knew"
8023,ENDNOTES:,"full well. She must needs grow sad when that she knew the sword, for it"
8024,ENDNOTES:,minded her of her wrongs; she began to weep. I ween bold Hagen had done
8025,ENDNOTES:,"it for this cause. Folker, the bold, drew nearer to the bench a fiddle"
8026,ENDNOTES:,"bow, strong, mickle, and long, like unto a broad, sharp sword, and there"
8027,ENDNOTES:,the two lusty knights sate undaunted. These two brave men did think
8028,ENDNOTES:,"themselves so lordly, that they would not leave their seats through fear"

8030,ENDNOTES:,"them hostile greeting. She spake: ""Now tell me, Hagen, who hath sent for"

8068,ENDNOTES:,"a war path, when here at Etzel's court they waged so many wars in honor"
8069,ENDNOTES:,"of the king. Much this happed, wherefore one must justly honor Hagen. At"
8070,ENDNOTES:,that time the warrior was of his years a lad. How gray are they who then

8077,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the fiddler: ""We have now well seen that we shall find foes"

8089,ENDNOTES:,"Bold Folker gan speak loudly to his lords: ""How long will ye stand and"

8092,ENDNOTES:,
8093,ENDNOTES:,Men then saw the brave heroes and good pair off. The prince of Berne
8094,ENDNOTES:,took by the hand the mighty Gunther of Burgundian land. Irnfried (4)
8095,ENDNOTES:,"took the brave knight Gernot, while Rudeger was seen to go to court with"
8096,ENDNOTES:,"Giselher. But however any paired, Folker and Hagen never parted, save"
8097,ENDNOTES:,"in one fray, when their end was come, and this noble ladies must needs"
8098,ENDNOTES:,greatly bewail in after time. With the kings one saw go to court a
8099,ENDNOTES:,"thousand brave men of their fellowship, thereto sixty champions that"
8100,ENDNOTES:,"were come with them, whom the bold Hagen had taken from his land. Hawart"
8101,ENDNOTES:,"and Iring, (5) two chosen men, were seen to walk together near the"
8102,ENDNOTES:,"kings. Men saw Dankwart and Wolfhart, a peerless knight, display their"
8103,ENDNOTES:,chivalry before all eyes.
8104,ENDNOTES:,
8105,ENDNOTES:,"When the lord of the Rhine had entered the hall, the mighty Etzel"
8106,ENDNOTES:,"delayed no longer, but sprang from his throne when he saw him"

8183,ENDNOTES:,One saw there many a cunningly wrought quilt from Arras (1) of shining
8184,ENDNOTES:,"silken cloth and many a coverlet of Arabian silk, the best that might be"

8208,ENDNOTES:,
8209,ENDNOTES:,"Both then donned their shining armor and either took his shield in hand,"
8210,ENDNOTES:,walked out of the house and stood before the door. Thus they cared for

8212,ENDNOTES:,"against the side of the hall, then turned him back and fetched his"
8213,ENDNOTES:,fiddle and served his friends as well befit the hero. Beneath the door
8214,ENDNOTES:,of the house he sate him down upon a stone; bolder fiddler was there
8215,ENDNOTES:,"never. When the tones of the strings rang forth so sweetly, the proud"
8216,ENDNOTES:,wanderers gave Folker thanks. At first the strings twanged so that the
8217,ENDNOTES:,whole house resounded; his strength and his skill were both passing
8218,ENDNOTES:,"great. Then sweeter and softer he began to play, and thus many a"
8219,ENDNOTES:,care-worn man he lulled to sleep. When he marked that all had fallen
8220,ENDNOTES:,"asleep, the knight took again his shield and left the room and took"
8221,ENDNOTES:,"his stand before the tower, and there he guarded the wanderers against"
8222,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild's men.
8223,ENDNOTES:,
8224,ENDNOTES:,'Twas about the middle of the night (I know not but what it happed a

8238,ENDNOTES:,"weareth a glittering helmet, shining and hard, strong and whole. His"
8239,ENDNOTES:,armor rings flash out like fire. By him standeth Hagen; in sooth the
8240,ENDNOTES:,"guests be guarded well."""
8241,ENDNOTES:,
8242,ENDNOTES:,"Straightway they turned again. When Folker saw this, wrathfully he spake"
8243,ENDNOTES:,"to his comrade-at-arms: ""Now let me go from the house to the warriors. I"
8244,ENDNOTES:,"would fain put some questions to Lady Kriemhild's men."""
8245,ENDNOTES:,
8246,ENDNOTES:,"""For my sake, no,"" quoth Hagen. ""If ye leave the house, the doughty"
8247,ENDNOTES:,"knights are like to bring you in such stress with their swords, that I"
8248,ENDNOTES:,must aid you even should it be the death of all my kin. As soon as we
8249,ENDNOTES:,"be come into the fray, twain of them, or four, would in a short time run"

8251,ENDNOTES:,"might never cease to mourn."""
8252,ENDNOTES:,

8256,ENDNOTES:,
8257,ENDNOTES:,"Straightway Folker then called out to them: ""How go ye thus armed, ye"

8260,ENDNOTES:,
8261,ENDNOTES:,"To this none made reply. Angry grew his mood. ""Fy! Ye evil cowards,"""

8281,ENDNOTES:,
8282,ENDNOTES:,Then they waked the many knights who still lay sleeping. The light of
8283,ENDNOTES:,dawn shone into the hall upon the strangers. On all sides Hagen gan wake
8284,ENDNOTES:,"the warriors, if perchance they would fain go to the minster for"
8285,ENDNOTES:,mass. Men now loudly rang the bells in Christian fashion. Heathens and
8286,ENDNOTES:,"Christians did not sing alike, so that it was seen full well that they"
8287,ENDNOTES:,"were not as one. Gunther's liegemen now would go to church, and all"
8288,ENDNOTES:,alike had risen from their beds. The champions laced them into such
8289,ENDNOTES:,"goodly garments, that never did hero bring better clothes to the land of"
8290,ENDNOTES:,"any king. This vexed Hagen. He spake: ""Heroes, ye should wear here other"
8291,ENDNOTES:,"clothes. Certes, ye know full well the tales. Instead of roses, bear"
8292,ENDNOTES:,"weapons in your hands; instead of jeweled chaplets, your bright helms"
8293,ENDNOTES:,"and good, sith ye know full well the wicked Kriemhild's mood. Let"
8294,ENDNOTES:,"me tell you, we must fight to-day, so instead of silken shirts, wear"
8295,ENDNOTES:,"hauberks, and instead of rich cloaks, good shields and broad, so that if"
8296,ENDNOTES:,"any grow angry with you, ye be full armed. Dear my lords, and all my kin"
8297,ENDNOTES:,"and liegemen, go willingly to church and make plaint to the mighty God"
8298,ENDNOTES:,"of your fears and need, for know full sure that death draweth nigh us."
8299,ENDNOTES:,Nor must ye forget to confess aught that ye have done and stand full
8300,ENDNOTES:,"zealously before your God. Of this I warn you, noble knights, unless God"
8301,ENDNOTES:,"in heaven so will, ye'll never more hear mass."""
8302,ENDNOTES:,
8303,ENDNOTES:,So the princes and their liegemen went to the minster. In the holy
8304,ENDNOTES:,"churchyard bold Hagen bade them halt, that they might not be parted."
8305,ENDNOTES:,"He spake: ""Of a truth none knoweth what will hap to us from the Huns."
8306,ENDNOTES:,"Place, my friends, your shields before your feet, and if any proffer"
8307,ENDNOTES:,"you cold greeting, repay it with deep and mortal wounds. That is Hagen's"

8309,ENDNOTES:,
8310,ENDNOTES:,"Folker and Hagen, the twain, then hied them to the spacious minster."
8311,ENDNOTES:,"This was done that the queen might press upon them in the crowd. Certes,"
8312,ENDNOTES:,"she was passing grim. Then came the lord of the land and his fair wife,"
8313,ENDNOTES:,"her body adorned with rich apparel; Doughty warriors, too, were seen to"
8314,ENDNOTES:,walk beside her. One saw the dust rise high from Kriemhild's band. When
8315,ENDNOTES:,"mighty Etzel spied the kings and their fellowship thus armed, how quick"
8316,ENDNOTES:,"he spake: ""Why do I see my friends thus go with helmets? Upon my troth,"
8317,ENDNOTES:,"it grieveth me, and hath any done them aught, I shall gladly make"
8318,ENDNOTES:,"amends, as doth think them good. Hath any made heavy their hearts or"
8319,ENDNOTES:,"mood, I'll show them well, that it doth irk me much. I am ready for"
8320,ENDNOTES:,"whatever they command me."""
8321,ENDNOTES:,
8322,ENDNOTES:,"To this Hagen answered: ""None hath done us aught; it is the custom of my"
8323,ENDNOTES:,lordings that they go armed at all high feasts for full three days. We
8324,ENDNOTES:,"should tell Etzel, had aught been done us."""
8325,ENDNOTES:,
8326,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild heard full well what Hagen spake. How right hostilely she
8327,ENDNOTES:,"gazed into his eyes! She would not tell the custom of their land, albeit"
8328,ENDNOTES:,she had known it long in Burgundy. However grim and strong the hate
8329,ENDNOTES:,"she bare them, yet had any told Etzel the truth, he would have surely"
8330,ENDNOTES:,hindered what later happed. Because of their great haughtiness they
8331,ENDNOTES:,"scorned to tell him. When the great crowd went past with the queen,"
8332,ENDNOTES:,"these twain, Hagen and Folker, would not step back more than two"
8333,ENDNOTES:,"hand-breadths, the which irked the Huns. Forsooth they had to jostle"
8334,ENDNOTES:,with the lusty heroes. This thought King Etzel's chamberlains not good.
8335,ENDNOTES:,"Certes, they would have fain angered the champions, but that they durst"
8336,ENDNOTES:,"not before the noble king. So there was much jostling, but nothing more."
8337,ENDNOTES:,
8338,ENDNOTES:,"When they had worshiped God and would hence again, many a Hunnish"
8339,ENDNOTES:,warrior horsed him passing soon. At Kriemhild's side stood many a comely
8340,ENDNOTES:,"maid, and well seven thousand knights rode with the queen. Kriemhild"
8341,ENDNOTES:,with her ladies sate her down at the easements by the side of the mighty
8342,ENDNOTES:,"Etzel, which was him lief, for they would watch the lusty heroes joust."
8343,ENDNOTES:,"Ho, what stranger knights rode before them in the court! Then was come"
8344,ENDNOTES:,the marshal with the squires. Bold Dankwart had taken to him his lord's
8345,ENDNOTES:,retainers from the Burgundian land; the steeds of the Nibelungs they
8346,ENDNOTES:,"found well saddled. When now the kings and their men were come to horse,"
8347,ENDNOTES:,stalwart Folker gan advise that they should ride a joust after the
8348,ENDNOTES:,fashion of their land. At this the heroes rode in lordly wise; none it
8349,ENDNOTES:,irked what the knight had counseled. The hurtling and the noise waxed
8350,ENDNOTES:,"loud, as the many men rode into the broad court. Etzel and Kriemhild"
8351,ENDNOTES:,themselves beheld the scene. To the jousts were come six hundred knights
8352,ENDNOTES:,"of Dietrich's men to match the strangers, for they would have pastime"
8353,ENDNOTES:,"with the Burgundians. Fain would they have done it, had he given them"
8354,ENDNOTES:,"leave. Ho, what good champions rode in their train! The tale was told to"
8355,ENDNOTES:,Sir Dietrich and he forbade the game with Gunther's men; he feared for
8356,ENDNOTES:,"his liegemen, and well he might."
8357,ENDNOTES:,
8358,ENDNOTES:,"When those of Berne had departed thence, there came the men of Rudeger"
8359,ENDNOTES:,"from Bechelaren, five hundred strong, with shields, riding out before"
8360,ENDNOTES:,"the hall. It would have been lief to the margrave, had they left it"
8361,ENDNOTES:,undone. Wisely he rode then to them through the press and said to his
8362,ENDNOTES:,"knights, that they were ware that Gunther's men were evil-minded toward"
8363,ENDNOTES:,"them. If they would leave off the jousting, it would please him much."
8364,ENDNOTES:,"When now these lusty heroes parted from them, then came those of"
8365,ENDNOTES:,"Thuringia, as we are told, and well a thousand brave men from Denmark."
8366,ENDNOTES:,From the tilting one saw many truncheons (2) flying hence. Irnfried and
8367,ENDNOTES:,Hawart now rode into the tourney. Proudly those from the Rhine awaited
8368,ENDNOTES:,them and offered the men of Thuringia many a joust. Many a lordly shield
8369,ENDNOTES:,was riddled by the thrusts. Thither came then Sir Bloedel with three
8370,ENDNOTES:,"thousand men. Well was he seen of Etzel and Kriemhild, for the knightly"
8371,ENDNOTES:,"sports happed just before the twain. The queen saw it gladly, that the"
8372,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundians might come to grief. Schrutan (3) and Gibecke, Ramung and"
8373,ENDNOTES:,"Hornbog, (4) rode into the tourney in Hunnish wise. To the heroes from"
8374,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land they addressed them. High above the roof of the royal
8375,ENDNOTES:,"hall the spear-shafts whirled. Whatever any there plied, 'twas but a"
8376,ENDNOTES:,friendly rout. Palace and hall were heard resounding loud through the
8377,ENDNOTES:,clashing of the shields of Gunther's men. With great honor his meiny
8378,ENDNOTES:,"gained the meed. Their pastime was so mickle and so great, that from"
8379,ENDNOTES:,"beneath the housings of the good steeds, which the heroes rode, there"
8380,ENDNOTES:,flowed the frothy sweat. In haughty wise they encountered with the Huns.
8381,ENDNOTES:,
8382,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the fiddler, Folker the minstrel: ""I ween these warriors"

8405,ENDNOTES:,
8406,ENDNOTES:,"The doughty Folker rode into the lists again, which soon gave many a"

8408,ENDNOTES:,this both maid and wife were seen thereafter to bewail. Full hard and
8409,ENDNOTES:,fast gan Hagen and his liegemen and sixty of his knights ride towards
8410,ENDNOTES:,"the fiddler, where the play was on. This Etzel and Kriemhild clearly"
8411,ENDNOTES:,saw. The three kings would not leave their minstrel without guard amidst
8412,ENDNOTES:,the foe. Cunningly a thousand heroes rode; with haughty bearing they did
8413,ENDNOTES:,"whatso they would. When now the wealthy Hun was slain, men heard his kin"
8414,ENDNOTES:,"cry out and wail. All the courtiers asked: ""Who hath done this deed?"""

8416,ENDNOTES:,"""That the fiddler did, Folker, the valiant minstrel."""
8417,ENDNOTES:,
8418,ENDNOTES:,The margrave's kindred from the Hunnish land called straightway for
8419,ENDNOTES:,"their swords and shields, and would fain have done Folker to death. Fast"
8420,ENDNOTES:,the host gan hasten from the windows. Great rout arose from the folk on
8421,ENDNOTES:,"every side. The kings and their fellowship, the Burgundian men, alighted"
8422,ENDNOTES:,before the hall and drove their horses to the rear. Then King Etzel came
8423,ENDNOTES:,to part the strife. From the hand of a kinsman of the Hun he wrenched
8424,ENDNOTES:,"a sturdy weapon and drove them all back again, for full great was his"
8425,ENDNOTES:,"wrath. ""Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?"
8426,ENDNOTES:,"Had ye slain this minstrel at my court,"" spake King Etzel, ""'twere evil"

8430,ENDNOTES:,
8431,ENDNOTES:,Thus he became their safe-guard. To the stalls men led away the steeds;

8433,ENDNOTES:,"The host now hied him to his palace with his friends, nor would he let"
8434,ENDNOTES:,any man grow wroth again. Then men set up the tables and bare forth

8482,ENDNOTES:,
8483,ENDNOTES:,"When the queen left Bloedel in lust of battle, she went to table with"
8484,ENDNOTES:,King Etzel and his men. Evil counsels had she held against the guests.
8485,ENDNOTES:,Since the strife could be started in no other wise (Kriemhild's ancient
8486,ENDNOTES:,"wrong still lay deep buried in her heart), she bade King Etzel's son"
8487,ENDNOTES:,be brought to table. How might a woman ever do more ghastly deed for
8488,ENDNOTES:,"vengeance' sake? Four of Etzel's men went hence anon and bare Ortlieb,"

8556,ENDNOTES:,"""Of a truth, I wot not how to tell you of these tales; thy kinsmen,"

8578,ENDNOTES:,
8579,ENDNOTES:,Those that had no sword reached down in front of the benches and lifted

8581,ENDNOTES:,"abide no longer, but with the heavy stools they dealt many bruises"
8582,ENDNOTES:,through the helmets. How fiercely the stranger youths did ward them!
8583,ENDNOTES:,"Out of the house they drove at last the men-at-arms, but five hundred"

8585,ENDNOTES:,wet with blood.
8586,ENDNOTES:,
8587,ENDNOTES:,These grievous tales were told now to Etzel's knights; grim was their
8588,ENDNOTES:,"sorrow, that Bloedel and his men were slain. This Hagen's brother and"

8591,ENDNOTES:,"(this must needs be), and of the fellowship they left not one alive."
8592,ENDNOTES:,The faithless Huns brought a mickle band before the house. Well the
8593,ENDNOTES:,"strangers stood their ground, but what booted their doughty prowess?"
8594,ENDNOTES:,Dead they all must lie. Then in a few short hours there rose a fearful
8595,ENDNOTES:,dole. Now ye may hear wonders of a monstrous thing. Nine thousand yeomen
8596,ENDNOTES:,lay there slain and thereto twelve good knights of Dankwart's men. One
8597,ENDNOTES:,"saw him stand alone still by the foe. The noise was hushed, the din had"
8598,ENDNOTES:,"died away, when Dankwart, the hero, gazed over his shoulders. He spake:"

8601,ENDNOTES:,
8602,ENDNOTES:,Upon his single person the sword-strokes fell thick and fast. The wife
8603,ENDNOTES:,"of many a hero must later mourn for this. Higher he raised his shield,"

8605,ENDNOTES:,"blood. ""Woe is me of all this sorrow,"" quoth Aldrian's son. (3) ""Give"

8610,ENDNOTES:,"strife-weary man sprang from the house, how many added swords rang on"

8612,ENDNOTES:,"sprang towards the hero of the Burgundian land. ""Now would to God,"""

8629,ENDNOTES:,"they weened to overpower him, sith he no longer bare a shield. Ho, what"
8630,ENDNOTES:,deep wounds he struck them through their helmets! From this many a brave
8631,ENDNOTES:,"man was forced to reel before him, and bold Dankwart gained thereby"
8632,ENDNOTES:,"great praise. From either side they sprang upon him, but in truth a many"
8633,ENDNOTES:,"of them entered the fray too soon. Before his foes he walked, as doth a"
8634,ENDNOTES:,boar to the woods before the dogs. How might he be more brave? His path
8635,ENDNOTES:,"was ever wet with reeking blood. Certes, no single champion might ever"
8636,ENDNOTES:,fight better with his foes than he had done. Men now saw Hagen's brother
8637,ENDNOTES:,go to court in lordly wise. Sewers (4) and cupbearers heard the ring of
8638,ENDNOTES:,"swords, and full many a one cast from his hand the drink and whatever"

8712,ENDNOTES:,"the table to the ground. A piteous meed it was, which he meted out to"
8713,ENDNOTES:,the master. Hagen then spied a gleeman sitting at King Etzel's board.
8714,ENDNOTES:,In his wrath he hied him thither and struck off his right hand upon the
8715,ENDNOTES:,"fiddle. ""Take this as message to the Burgundian land."""
8716,ENDNOTES:,
8717,ENDNOTES:,"""Woe is me of my hand,"" spake the minstrel Werbel. ""Sir Hagen of Troneg,"
8718,ENDNOTES:,what had I done to you? I came in good faith to your masters' land. How
8719,ENDNOTES:,"can I now thrum the tunes, sith I have lost my hand?"""
8720,ENDNOTES:,
8721,ENDNOTES:,"Little recked Hagen, played he nevermore. In the hall he dealt out"
8722,ENDNOTES:,"fierce deadly wounds to Etzel's warriors, passing many of whom he slew."
8723,ENDNOTES:,Enow of folk in the house he did to death. The doughty Folker now sprang
8724,ENDNOTES:,up from the board; loud rang in his hands his fiddle bow. Rudely did
8725,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther's minstrel play. Ho, what foes he made him among the valiant"
8726,ENDNOTES:,"Huns! The three noble kings, too, sprang up from the table. Gladly would"
8727,ENDNOTES:,"they have parted the fray, or ever greater scathe was done. With all"
8728,ENDNOTES:,"their wit they could not hinder it, when Folker and Hagen gan rage so"
8729,ENDNOTES:,"sore. When that the lord of the Rhine beheld the fray unparted, the"
8730,ENDNOTES:,prince dealt his foes many gaping wounds himself through the shining
8731,ENDNOTES:,"armor rings. That he was a hero of his hands, he gave great proof. Then"
8732,ENDNOTES:,"the sturdy Gernot joined the strife. Certes, he did many a hero of"
8733,ENDNOTES:,"the Huns to death with a sharp sword, the which Rudeger had given him."
8734,ENDNOTES:,Mighty wounds he dealt King Etzel's warriors. Now the young son of Lady
8735,ENDNOTES:,Uta rushed to the fray. Gloriously his sword rang on the helmets of
8736,ENDNOTES:,Etzel's warriors from the Hunnish land. Full mickle wonders were wrought
8737,ENDNOTES:,"by bold Giselher's hand. But how so doughty they all were, the kings and"
8738,ENDNOTES:,"their liegemen, yet Folker was seen to stand before them all against"
8739,ENDNOTES:,the foe; a good hero he. Many a one he made to fall in his blood through
8740,ENDNOTES:,"wounds. Etzel's men did fend them, too, full well, yet one saw the"
8741,ENDNOTES:,strangers go hewing with their gleaming swords through the royal hall
8742,ENDNOTES:,and on every side was heard great sound of wail. Those without would now
8743,ENDNOTES:,"fain be with their friends within, but at the entrance towers they found"
8744,ENDNOTES:,"small gain. Those within had gladly been without the hall, but Dankwart"
8745,ENDNOTES:,let none go either up or down the steps. Therefore there rose before
8746,ENDNOTES:,"the towers a mighty press, and helmets rang loudly from the sword-blows."
8747,ENDNOTES:,"Bold Dankwart came into great stress thereby; this his brother feared,"
8748,ENDNOTES:,as his loyalty did bid him.
8749,ENDNOTES:,
8750,ENDNOTES:,"Loudly then Hagen called to Folker: ""See ye yonder, comrade, my brother"
8751,ENDNOTES:,"stand before the Hunnish warriors amid a rain of blows? Friend, save my"
8752,ENDNOTES:,"brother, or ever we lose the knight."""
8753,ENDNOTES:,
8754,ENDNOTES:,"""That will I surely,"" quoth the minstrel, and through the palace he went"
8755,ENDNOTES:,"a-fiddling, his stout sword ringing often in his hand. Great thanks were"
8756,ENDNOTES:,tendered by the warriors from the Rhine. Bold Folker spake to Dankwart:
8757,ENDNOTES:,"""Great discomfiture have ye suffered to-day, therefore your brother bade"
8758,ENDNOTES:,"me hasten to your aid. Will ye stand without, so will I stand within."""
8759,ENDNOTES:,
8760,ENDNOTES:,Sturdy Dankwart stood without the door and guarded the staircase against
8761,ENDNOTES:,"whoever came, wherefore men heard the swords resound in the heroes'"
8762,ENDNOTES:,hands. Folker of Burgundy land performed the same within. Across
8763,ENDNOTES:,"the press the bold fiddler cried: ""Friend Hagen, the hall is locked;"
8764,ENDNOTES:,forsooth King Etzel's door is bolted well. The hands of two heroes guard
8765,ENDNOTES:,"it, as with a thousand bars."" When Hagen of Troneg beheld the door so"
8766,ENDNOTES:,"well defended, the famous hero and good slung his shield upon his back"
8767,ENDNOTES:,and gan avenge the wrongs that had been done him there. His foes had now
8768,ENDNOTES:,no sort of hope to live.
8769,ENDNOTES:,
8770,ENDNOTES:,"When now the lord of Berne, the king of the Amelungs, (2) beheld aright"
8771,ENDNOTES:,"that the mighty Hagen broke so many a helm, upon a bench he sprang and"

8773,ENDNOTES:,
8774,ENDNOTES:,"The host, too, was sore adread, as behooved him now, for his life was"

8776,ENDNOTES:,away before his eyes! He sate full anxious; what booted it him that he
8777,ENDNOTES:,"was king? Haughty Kriemhild now cried aloud to Dietrich: ""Pray help me"
8778,ENDNOTES:,"hence alive, most noble knight, by the virtues of all the princes of the"
8779,ENDNOTES:,"Amelung land. If Hagen reach me, I shall grasp death by the hand."""
8780,ENDNOTES:,
8781,ENDNOTES:,"""How shall I help you, noble queen?"" spake Sir Dietrich. ""I fear for"

8784,ENDNOTES:,
8785,ENDNOTES:,"""Nay, not so, Sir Dietrich, noble knight and good. Let thy chivalrous"

8787,ENDNOTES:,cause had Kriemhild for this fear.
8788,ENDNOTES:,
8789,ENDNOTES:,"""I'll try to see if I may help you, for it is long since that I have"

8792,ENDNOTES:,
8793,ENDNOTES:,"Loudly the chosen knight gan call, so that his voice rang forth as from"
8794,ENDNOTES:,"a bison's horn, until the broad castle resounded with his force. Sir"

8796,ENDNOTES:,
8797,ENDNOTES:,"When Gunther heard this man cry out in the heated strife, he began to"

8803,ENDNOTES:,
8804,ENDNOTES:,"When Gunther thus begged and bade in the stress of the fray, they"
8805,ENDNOTES:,"sheathed their swords. Passing great was his power, so that none struck"
8806,ENDNOTES:,a blow. Soon enow he asked the tidings of the knight of Berne. He spake:
8807,ENDNOTES:,"""Most noble Dietrich, what hath happed to you through these my friends?"

8809,ENDNOTES:,"aught, 'twould grieve me sore."""

8890,ENDNOTES:,
8891,ENDNOTES:,The lordings sate them down for weariness. Folker and Hagen came forth
8892,ENDNOTES:,from the hall; upon their shields the haughty warriors leaned. Wise
8893,ENDNOTES:,words were spoken by the twain. Then Knight Giselher of Burgundy spake:
8894,ENDNOTES:,"""Forsooth, dear friends, ye may not ease you yet; ye must bear the"
8895,ENDNOTES:,"dead from out the hall. I'll tell you, of a truth, we shall be attacked"
8896,ENDNOTES:,again. They must no longer lie here beneath our feet. Ere the Huns
8897,ENDNOTES:,"vanquish us by storm, we'll yet how wounds, which shall ease my heart."
8898,ENDNOTES:,"For this,"" quoth Giselher, ""I have a steadfast mind."""
8899,ENDNOTES:,
8900,ENDNOTES:,"""Well is me of such a lord,"" spake then Hagen. ""This rede which my young"

8903,ENDNOTES:,
8904,ENDNOTES:,"Then they followed the rede, and to the door they bare seven thousand"
8905,ENDNOTES:,"dead, the which they cast outside. Down they fell before the stairway"

8907,ENDNOTES:,"were with such slight wounds that, had they been more gently treated,"
8908,ENDNOTES:,"they would have waxed well again; but from the lofty fall, they must"
8909,ENDNOTES:,"needs lie dead. Their friends bewailed this, and forsooth they had good"
8910,ENDNOTES:,cause.
8911,ENDNOTES:,
8912,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Folker, the fiddler, a lusty knight: ""Now I mark the truth of"

8915,ENDNOTES:,
8916,ENDNOTES:,"A margrave weened, he spake through kindness. Seeing one of his kinsmen"

8919,ENDNOTES:,"flight began as the others saw this deed, and all fell to cursing this"
8920,ENDNOTES:,"selfsame minstrel. He snatched javelin, sharp and hard, the which had"
8921,ENDNOTES:,"been hurled at him by a Hun, and cast it with might across the court,"
8922,ENDNOTES:,far over the folk. Thus he forced Etzel's warriors to take lodgement
8923,ENDNOTES:,further from the hall. On every side the people feared his mighty
8924,ENDNOTES:,prowess.
8925,ENDNOTES:,
8926,ENDNOTES:,Many thousand men now stood before the hall. Folker and Hagen gan speak

8994,ENDNOTES:,"honor, they let him go. Then a fierce conflict rose between the twain."
8995,ENDNOTES:,"Iring of Denmark, the peerless high-born knight, bare high his spear and"

8998,ENDNOTES:,main they cast the spears with their hands through the sturdy shields

9004,ENDNOTES:,
9005,ENDNOTES:,"Iring now left Hagen stand unharmed, and hied him to the fiddler. He"

9007,ENDNOTES:,"to guard bin, well. Then the fiddler struck a blow, that the plates of"
9008,ENDNOTES:,"mail whirled high above the buckler's rim. An evil man he was, for"
9009,ENDNOTES:,"to encounter, so Iring let him stand and rushed at Gunther of the"
9010,ENDNOTES:,"Burgundian land. Here, too, either was strong enow in strife. The blows"

9026,ENDNOTES:,unwounded here before Sir Giselher. From the crashing of the helmet
9027,ENDNOTES:,"and the ringing of the sword, his wits had grown so weak that the brave"

9036,ENDNOTES:,"found Hagen, whom he dealt a furious blow with his powerful hand."
9037,ENDNOTES:,
9038,ENDNOTES:,"Hagen thought him: ""Thou art doomed. Unless be that the foul fiend"
9039,ENDNOTES:,"protect thee, thou canst not escape alive."""
9040,ENDNOTES:,
9041,ENDNOTES:,Yet Iring wounded Hagen through his crest. This the hero wrought with
9042,ENDNOTES:,"Waska, (2) a passing goodly sword. When Sir Hagen felt the wound, wildly"
9043,ENDNOTES:,he brandished his weapon in his hand. Soon Hawart's liegeman was forced
9044,ENDNOTES:,"to yield his ground, and Hagen gan pursue him down the stairs. Brave"
9045,ENDNOTES:,"Iring swung his shield above his head, but had the staircase been the"
9046,ENDNOTES:,"length of three, Hagen would not have let him strike a blow the while."
9047,ENDNOTES:,"Ho, what red sparks did play above his helmet!"
9048,ENDNOTES:,
9049,ENDNOTES:,Iring returned scatheless to his liegemen. Then the tidings were brought
9050,ENDNOTES:,"to Kriemhild, of that which he had wrought in strife with Hagen of"
9051,ENDNOTES:,"Troneg. For this the queen gan thank him highly. ""Now God requite thee,"
9052,ENDNOTES:,"Iring, thou peerless hero and good. Thou hast comforted well my heart"
9053,ENDNOTES:,"and mind. I see that Hagen's weeds be wet with blood."" For very joy"
9054,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild herself relieved him of his shield.
9055,ENDNOTES:,
9056,ENDNOTES:,"""Be not too lavish of your thanks,"" spake Hagen. ""'Twould well befit a"
9057,ENDNOTES:,"knight to try again. A valiant man were he, if he then came back alive."
9058,ENDNOTES:,"Little shall the wound profit you, which I have at his bands; for that"
9059,ENDNOTES:,ye have seen the rings wet with blood from my wound doth urge me to the
9060,ENDNOTES:,death of many a man. Now first am I enraged at Hawart's liegeman. Small
9061,ENDNOTES:,"scathe hath Knight Iring done me yet."""
9062,ENDNOTES:,
9063,ENDNOTES:,Meanwhile Iring of Denmark stood in the breeze; he cooled his harness
9064,ENDNOTES:,"and doffed his casque. All the folk then praised his prowess, at which"
9065,ENDNOTES:,"the margrave was in passing lofty mood. Again Sir Iring spake: ""My"
9066,ENDNOTES:,"friends, this know; arm me now quickly, for I would fain try again, if"
9067,ENDNOTES:,"perchance I may not conquer this overweening man."""
9068,ENDNOTES:,
9069,ENDNOTES:,"His shield was hewn to pieces, a better one he gained; full soon the"
9070,ENDNOTES:,champion was armed again. Through hate he seized a passing heavy spear
9071,ENDNOTES:,with which he would encounter Hagen yonder. Meantime the death-grim
9072,ENDNOTES:,man awaited him in hostile wise. But Knight Hagen would not abide his
9073,ENDNOTES:,"coming. Hurling the javelin and brandishing his sword, he ran to meet"
9074,ENDNOTES:,him to the very bottom of the stairs. Forsooth his rage was great.
9075,ENDNOTES:,"Little booted Iring then his strength; through the shields they smote,"
9076,ENDNOTES:,so that the flames rose high in fiery blasts. Hagen sorely wounded
9077,ENDNOTES:,Hawart's liegeman with his sword through shield and breastplate. Never
9078,ENDNOTES:,"waxed he well again. When now Knight Iring felt the wound, higher above"
9079,ENDNOTES:,his helmet bands he raised his shield. Great enow he thought the scathe
9080,ENDNOTES:,"he here received, but thereafter King Gunther's liegeman did him more of"
9081,ENDNOTES:,harm. Hagen found a spear lying now before his feet. With this he shot
9082,ENDNOTES:,"Iring, the Danish hero, so that the shaft stood forth from his head."
9083,ENDNOTES:,Champion Hagen had given him a bitter end. Iring must needs retreat
9084,ENDNOTES:,to those of Denmark. Or ever they unbound his helmet and drew the
9085,ENDNOTES:,"spear-shaft from his head, death had already drawn nigh him. At this his"
9086,ENDNOTES:,"kinsmen wept, as forsooth they had great need."
9087,ENDNOTES:,
9088,ENDNOTES:,Then the queen came and bent above him. She gan bewail the stalwart
9089,ENDNOTES:,"Iring and bewept his wounds, indeed her grief was passing sharp. At this"
9090,ENDNOTES:,"the bold and lusty warrior spake before his kinsmen: ""Let be this wail,"
9091,ENDNOTES:,"most royal queen. What availeth your weeping now? Certes, I must lose"
9092,ENDNOTES:,my life from these wounds I have received. Death will no longer let me
9093,ENDNOTES:,"serve you and Etzel."" To the men of Thuringia and to those of Denmark he"
9094,ENDNOTES:,"spake: ""None of you must take from the queen her shining ruddy gold as"
9095,ENDNOTES:,"meed, for if ye encounter Hagen, ye must gaze on death."""
9096,ENDNOTES:,
9097,ENDNOTES:,Pale grew his hue; brave Iring bare the mark of death. Dole enow it
9098,ENDNOTES:,"gave them, for no longer might Hawart's liegeman live. Then the men"
9099,ENDNOTES:,of Denmark must needs renew the fray. Irnfried and Hawart with well a
9100,ENDNOTES:,thousand champions leaped toward the hall. On every side one heard a
9101,ENDNOTES:,"monstrous uproar, mighty and strong. Ho, what sturdy javelins were cast"
9102,ENDNOTES:,"at the Burgundian men! Bold Irnfried rushed at the minstrel, but gained"
9103,ENDNOTES:,great damage at his hands. Through his sturdy helmet the noble fiddler
9104,ENDNOTES:,"smote the landgrave. Certes, he was grim enow! Then Sir Irnfried dealt"
9105,ENDNOTES:,the valiant gleeman such a blow that his coat of mail burst open and
9106,ENDNOTES:,his breastplate was enveloped with a bright red flame. Yet the landgrave
9107,ENDNOTES:,"fell dead at the minstrel's hands. Hawart and Hagen, too, had come"
9108,ENDNOTES:,"together. Wonders would he have seen, who beheld the fight. The swords"
9109,ENDNOTES:,fell thick and fast in the heroes' hands. Through the knight from the
9110,ENDNOTES:,Burgundian land Hawart needs must die. When the Thuringians and the
9111,ENDNOTES:,"Danes espied their lordings dead, there rose before the hall a fearful"
9112,ENDNOTES:,"strife, before they gained the door with mighty hand. Many a helm and"
9113,ENDNOTES:,shield was hacked and cut thereby.
9114,ENDNOTES:,
9115,ENDNOTES:,"""Give way,"" spake Folker, ""and let them in, for else what they have in"
9116,ENDNOTES:,mind will not be ended. They must die in here in full short time. With
9117,ENDNOTES:,"death they'll gain what the queen would give them."""
9118,ENDNOTES:,
9119,ENDNOTES:,"When these overweening men were come into the hall, the head of many a"
9120,ENDNOTES:,one sank down so low that he needs must die from their furious strokes.
9121,ENDNOTES:,"Well fought the valiant Gernot, and the same did Giselher, the knight. A"
9122,ENDNOTES:,thousand and four were come into the hall and many a whizzing stroke
9123,ENDNOTES:,"of the swords was seen flash forth, but soon all the warriors lay slain"
9124,ENDNOTES:,therein. Mickle wonders might one tell of the Burgundian men. The hall
9125,ENDNOTES:,"grew still, as the uproar died away. On every side the dead men's blood"
9126,ENDNOTES:,poured through the openings down to the drain-pipes. This the men from
9127,ENDNOTES:,the Rhine had wrought with their passing strength.
9128,ENDNOTES:,
9129,ENDNOTES:,Those from the Burgundian land now sate them down to rest and laid aside
9130,ENDNOTES:,their swords and shields. But still the valiant minstrel stood guard
9131,ENDNOTES:,"before the hall. He waited, if any would perchance draw near again in"
9132,ENDNOTES:,"strife. Sorely the king made wail, as did the queen. Maids and ladies"
9133,ENDNOTES:,"were distraught with grief. Death, I ween, had conspired against them,"
9134,ENDNOTES:,wherefore many of the warriors perished through the guests.

9148,ENDNOTES:,
9149,ENDNOTES:,"""Now unbind your helmets,"" spake the good Knight Hagen. ""I and my"

9151,ENDNOTES:,"again, I'll warn my lords as soon as I ever can."""
9152,ENDNOTES:,
9153,ENDNOTES:,Then many a good knight bared his head. They sate them down upon the
9154,ENDNOTES:,"wounded, who had fallen in the blood, done to death at their hands. Evil"
9155,ENDNOTES:,looks were cast upon the noble strangers. Before the eventide the king
9156,ENDNOTES:,and the queen brought it to pass that the Hunnish champions tried
9157,ENDNOTES:,"again. Men saw full twenty thousand warriors stand before them, who must"
9158,ENDNOTES:,perforce march to the fray. Straightway there rose a mighty storming
9159,ENDNOTES:,"towards the strangers. Dankwart, Hagen's brother, the doughty knight,"
9160,ENDNOTES:,sprang from his lordings' side to meet the foes without the door.
9161,ENDNOTES:,"All weened that he were dead, yet forth he stood again unscathed."
9162,ENDNOTES:,The furious strife did last till nightfall brought it to a close. As
9163,ENDNOTES:,"befitted good knights, the strangers warded off King Etzel's liegemen"
9164,ENDNOTES:,"the livelong summer day. Ho, how many a bold knight fell doomed before"
9165,ENDNOTES:,"them! This great slaughter happed upon midsummer's day, when Lady"
9166,ENDNOTES:,Kriemhild avenged her sorrow of heart upon her nearest kin and upon many
9167,ENDNOTES:,"another man, so that King Etzel never again gained joy."
9168,ENDNOTES:,
9169,ENDNOTES:,"The day had passed away, but still they had good cause for fear. They"
9170,ENDNOTES:,"thought, a short and speedy death were better for them, than to be"
9171,ENDNOTES:,longer racked with monstrous pain. A truce these proud and lusty knights
9172,ENDNOTES:,now craved; they begged that men would bring the king to see them. Forth
9173,ENDNOTES:,"from the hall stepped the heroes, bloody of hue, and the three noble"
9174,ENDNOTES:,"kings, stained from their armor. They wist not to whom they should make"
9175,ENDNOTES:,plaint of their mighty wounds. Thither both Etzel and Kriemhild went;
9176,ENDNOTES:,the land was theirs and so their band waxed large. He spake to the
9177,ENDNOTES:,"strangers: ""Pray tell me, what ye will of me? Ye ween to gain here"
9178,ENDNOTES:,"peace, but that may hardly be. For damage as great as ye have done me,"
9179,ENDNOTES:,"in my son and in my many kinsmen, whom ye have slain, peace and pardon"
9180,ENDNOTES:,"shall be denied you quite; it shall not boot you aught, an' I remain"
9181,ENDNOTES:,"alive."""
9182,ENDNOTES:,
9183,ENDNOTES:,"To this King Gunther answered: ""Dire need constrained us; all my"

9186,ENDNOTES:,
9187,ENDNOTES:,"Young Giselher of Burgundy likewise spake: ""Ye men of Etzel, who still"

9190,ENDNOTES:,
9191,ENDNOTES:,"Quoth they: ""From thy friendliness this castle is filled with grief and"

9203,ENDNOTES:,
9204,ENDNOTES:,"At this mighty Gernot spake to the king: ""May God then bid you act in"

9206,ENDNOTES:,descend to you into the open court. That will make to you for honor.
9207,ENDNOTES:,Let be done quickly whatever shall hap to us. Ye have still many men
9208,ENDNOTES:,"unscathed, who dare well encounter us and bereave us storm-weary men of"

9210,ENDNOTES:,
9211,ENDNOTES:,King Etzel's champions had nigh granted this boon and let them leave the
9212,ENDNOTES:,"hall, but Kriemhild heard it and sorely it misliked her. Therefore the"

9214,ENDNOTES:,"counsel you in true fealty, that ye do not what ye have in mind, and let"
9215,ENDNOTES:,"these murderers leave the hall, else must your kinsmen suffer a deadly"
9216,ENDNOTES:,"fall. Did none of them still live, save Uta's sons, my noble brothers,"

9233,ENDNOTES:,
9234,ENDNOTES:,"""Now God in heaven forbid,"" spake Gernot; ""were there here a thousand of"

9237,ENDNOTES:,
9238,ENDNOTES:,"""We all must die,"" spake then Giselher, ""but none shall hinder that we"

9240,ENDNOTES:,"for never have I failed a friend in fealty."""
9241,ENDNOTES:,
9242,ENDNOTES:,Then spake bold Dankwart (it had not beseemed him to have held his
9243,ENDNOTES:,"peace): ""Forsooth my brother Hagen standeth not alone. It may yet rue"

9246,ENDNOTES:,
9247,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake the queen: ""Ye full lusty heroes, now go nigher to the stairs"

9249,ENDNOTES:,right. I'll pay Hagen well for his overweening pride. Let none at all

9252,ENDNOTES:,
9253,ENDNOTES:,Soon were King Etzel's champions ready still stood without into the hall

9255,ENDNOTES:,liegemen would not part. For very fealty they could not leave each
9256,ENDNOTES:,"other. Etzel's queen then bade the hall be set on fire, and thus they"
9257,ENDNOTES:,racked the bodies of the knights with fire and flame. Fanned by the
9258,ENDNOTES:,"breeze, the whole house burst into flames full soon. I ween, no folk"
9259,ENDNOTES:,"did ever gain such great distress. Enow within cried out: ""Alack this"
9260,ENDNOTES:,plight! We would much rather die in stress of battle. It might move God
9261,ENDNOTES:,"to pity, how we all are lost! The queen now wreaketh monstrously on us"

9263,ENDNOTES:,
9264,ENDNOTES:,"Quoth one of them within: ""We must all lie dead. What avail us now the"

9267,ENDNOTES:,
9268,ENDNOTES:,"Then spake Hagen of Troneg: ""Ye noble knights and good, let him whom"

9271,ENDNOTES:,
9272,ENDNOTES:,"One of the warriors hied him then to where he found a corpse, and knelt"
9273,ENDNOTES:,him down beside the wound; then he unbound his helmet and began to drink
9274,ENDNOTES:,"the flowing blood. However little wont to such a drink, him thought it"
9275,ENDNOTES:,"passing good: ""Sir Hagen, now God requite you,"" spake the weary man,"
9276,ENDNOTES:,"""that I have drunk so well at your advice; seldom hath better wine been"
9277,ENDNOTES:,"proffered me. And I live yet a while, I shall ever be your friend."""
9278,ENDNOTES:,
9279,ENDNOTES:,"When now the others heard this, it thought them good, and soon there"
9280,ENDNOTES:,were many more that drank the blood. From this the body of each gained
9281,ENDNOTES:,much of strength; but many a stately dame paid dear for this through
9282,ENDNOTES:,the loss of loving kin. Into the hall the fire fell thick and fast upon
9283,ENDNOTES:,"them, but with their shields they turned it from them to the ground."
9284,ENDNOTES:,"Both the heat and the smoke did hurt them sore; in sooth, I ween, that"
9285,ENDNOTES:,nevermore will such anguish hap to heroes.
9286,ENDNOTES:,
9287,ENDNOTES:,"Again Hagen of Troneg spake: ""Stand by the sides of the hall. Let not"
9288,ENDNOTES:,"the firebrands fall upon your helmet bands, but stamp them with your"
9289,ENDNOTES:,feet down deeper in the blood. Forsooth it is an evil feast which the
9290,ENDNOTES:,"queen doth give us here."""
9291,ENDNOTES:,
9292,ENDNOTES:,"In such dire woes the night did wear away at last, and still the brave"
9293,ENDNOTES:,"minstrel and his comrade Hagen stood before the hall, a-leaning on their"
9294,ENDNOTES:,shields. More scathe they awaited from those of Etzel's band. Then spake
9295,ENDNOTES:,"the fiddler: ""Now go we into the hall. Then the Huns will ween, that we"
9296,ENDNOTES:,all be dead from the torture that hath been done us here. They'll yet
9297,ENDNOTES:,"see us go to meet them in the strife."""
9298,ENDNOTES:,
9299,ENDNOTES:,"Now spake Giselher of Burgundy, the youth: ""I trow the day dawneth, a"

9301,ENDNOTES:,"time, for my sister Kriemhild hath given us here an evil feast."""
9302,ENDNOTES:,
9303,ENDNOTES:,"Again one spake: ""I see the day. Sith we cannot hope for better things,"

9305,ENDNOTES:,"come to meet us soon again."""
9306,ENDNOTES:,
9307,ENDNOTES:,"The host weened well, that his guests were dead from their toil and the"
9308,ENDNOTES:,"pangs of fire; but yet within the hall six hundred brave men, as good as"
9309,ENDNOTES:,"any knight that king ever gained, were still alive. Those set to guard"
9310,ENDNOTES:,"the strangers had well seen that the guests still lived, despite the"
9311,ENDNOTES:,damage and the dole that had been done both to the lordings and their
9312,ENDNOTES:,men. In the hall one saw them stand full safe and sound. They then told
9313,ENDNOTES:,"Kriemhild that many were still alive, but the queen replied: ""It could"
9314,ENDNOTES:,"never be, that any should have lived through such stress of fire. Rather"
9315,ENDNOTES:,"will I believe that all lie dead."""
9316,ENDNOTES:,
9317,ENDNOTES:,"The lordings and their men would still fain have lived, had any listed"
9318,ENDNOTES:,"to do them mercy, but they could find none among those of the Hunnish"
9319,ENDNOTES:,land. So with full willing hand they avenged their dying. On this same
9320,ENDNOTES:,"day, towards morning, men proffered them a fierce attack as greeting,"
9321,ENDNOTES:,which brought the champions in stress again. Many a stout spear was
9322,ENDNOTES:,"hurled upon them, but the bold and lordly warriors warded them in"
9323,ENDNOTES:,knightly wise. High rose the mood of Etzel's men at the thought that
9324,ENDNOTES:,they should earn Queen Kriemhild's gold. Thereto they were minded to
9325,ENDNOTES:,perform whatso the King did bid them. Many of them because of this
9326,ENDNOTES:,must soon needs gaze on death. Of pledges and of gifts one might tell
9327,ENDNOTES:,wonders. She bade the ruddy gold be carried forth on shields and gave
9328,ENDNOTES:,"it to whomsoever craved it and would take it. Certes, greater wage was"
9329,ENDNOTES:,nevermore given against foes. To the hall a mickle force of well-armed
9330,ENDNOTES:,warriors marched.
9331,ENDNOTES:,
9332,ENDNOTES:,"Then cried bold Folker: ""We're here again, ye see. Never saw I heroes"

9335,ENDNOTES:,
9336,ENDNOTES:,"Then enow did call: ""Nearer, heroes, nearer, that we may do betimes what"

9338,ENDNOTES:,
9339,ENDNOTES:,Soon their shields were seen sticking full of darts that had been
9340,ENDNOTES:,thrown. What more can I say? Full twelve hundred men tried hard to match
9341,ENDNOTES:,"them, surging back and forth. The strangers cooled well their mood with"
9342,ENDNOTES:,"wounds. None might part the strife, and so blood was seen to flow from"
9343,ENDNOTES:,"mortal wounds, many of which were dealt. Each one was heard to wail for"
9344,ENDNOTES:,"friends. All the great king's doughty warriors died, and loving kinsmen"

9380,ENDNOTES:,
9381,ENDNOTES:,"""Away, thou arrant coward,"" cried Rudeger, ""forsooth I have enow of"

9595,ENDNOTES:,"Courteously the good Sir Rudeger bowed him low. On every side they wept,"

9597,ENDNOTES:,Rudeger would die the father of all knightly virtues.
9598,ENDNOTES:,
9599,ENDNOTES:,"Then Folker, the minstrel, spake from out the hall: ""Sith my comrade"

9612,ENDNOTES:,"guests. Many a furious blow the noble margrave struck. The twain, Folker"
9613,ENDNOTES:,"and Hagen, stepped further back, as they had vowed to him afore. Still"
9614,ENDNOTES:,"he found standing by the tower such valiant men, that Rudeger began the"
9615,ENDNOTES:,fight with anxious doubts. With murderous intent Gunther and Gernot let
9616,ENDNOTES:,"him in, good heroes they! Giselher stood further back, which irked him"
9617,ENDNOTES:,"sore, in truth. He voided Rudeger, for still he had hope of life. Then"
9618,ENDNOTES:,the margrave's men rushed at their foes; in knightly wise one saw them
9619,ENDNOTES:,"follow their lord. In their hands they bare their keen-edged swords,"
9620,ENDNOTES:,the which cleft there many a helm and lordly shield. The tired warriors
9621,ENDNOTES:,"dealt the men of Bechelaren many a mighty blow, that cut smooth and deep"
9622,ENDNOTES:,"through the shining mail, down to the very quick."
9623,ENDNOTES:,
9624,ENDNOTES:,Rudeger's noble fellowship was now come quite within. Into the fight
9625,ENDNOTES:,"Folker and Hagen sprang anon. They gave no quarter, save to one man"
9626,ENDNOTES:,alone. Through the hands of the twain the blood streamed down from
9627,ENDNOTES:,the helmets. How grimly rang the many swords within! The shield plates
9628,ENDNOTES:,"sprang from their fastenings, and the precious stones, cut from the"
9629,ENDNOTES:,"shields, fell down into the gore. So grimly they fought, that men will"
9630,ENDNOTES:,"never do the like again. The lord of Bechelaren raged to and fro, as"
9631,ENDNOTES:,one who wotteth how to use great prowess in the fray. Passing like to
9632,ENDNOTES:,a worshipful champion and a bold did Rudeger bear him on that day. Here
9633,ENDNOTES:,"stood the warriors, Gunther and Gernot, and smote many a hero dead in"
9634,ENDNOTES:,"the fray. Giselher and Dankwart, the twain, recked so little, that"
9635,ENDNOTES:,they brought full many a knight to his last day of life. Full well did
9636,ENDNOTES:,"Rudeger make appear that he was strong enow, brave and well-armed. Ho,"
9637,ENDNOTES:,"what knights he slew! This a Burgundian espied; perforce it angered him,"
9638,ENDNOTES:,and thus Sir Rudeger's death drew near.
9639,ENDNOTES:,
9640,ENDNOTES:,"The stalwart Gernot accosted the hero; to the margrave he spake: ""It"
9641,ENDNOTES:,"appeareth, ye will not leave my men alive, most noble Rudeger. That"
9642,ENDNOTES:,"irketh me beyond all measure, no longer can I bear the sight. So may"
9643,ENDNOTES:,"your present work you harm, sith ye have taken from me such store of"

9649,ENDNOTES:,"Either gan guard him against mighty wounds. So sharp were their swords,"
9650,ENDNOTES:,"that naught might avail against them. Then Rudeger, the knight, smote"
9651,ENDNOTES:,"Gernot a buffet through his helmet, the which was as hard as flint, so"
9652,ENDNOTES:,that the blood gushed forth. But this the bold knight and good repaid
9653,ENDNOTES:,"eftsoon. High in his hand he now poised Rudeger's gift, and though"
9654,ENDNOTES:,"wounded unto death, he smote him a stroke through his good and trusty"
9655,ENDNOTES:,shield down to his helmet band. And so fair Gotelind's husband was done
9656,ENDNOTES:,"to death. Certes, so rich a gift was never worse repaid. So fell alike"

9876,ENDNOTES:,"great the strides he took towards the hall, yet did old Hildebrand"
9877,ENDNOTES:,overtake him at the steps. He would not let him reach the fray before
9878,ENDNOTES:,him. At the hands of the homeless knights they later found the strife

9880,ENDNOTES:,"both one heard the swords ring out. That both were angry, might be"
9881,ENDNOTES:,plainly seen; from the swords of the twain streamed forth a blast of
9882,ENDNOTES:,fire-red sparks. Then they were parted in the stress of battle by the
9883,ENDNOTES:,"men of Berne, as their strength did bid them. At once Hildebrand turned"
9884,ENDNOTES:,"him away from Hagen, but stout Wolfhart addressed him to Folker the"
9885,ENDNOTES:,"bold. Such a blow he smote the fiddler upon his good helmet, that the"
9886,ENDNOTES:,sword's edge pierced to the very helmet bands. This the bold gleeman
9887,ENDNOTES:,"repaid with might; he smote Wolfhart, so that the sparks flew wide. Enow"
9888,ENDNOTES:,"of fire they struck from the armor rings, for each bare hatred to the"
9889,ENDNOTES:,"other. Then Knight Wolfwin of Berne did part them--an' he be not a hero,"
9890,ENDNOTES:,never was there one.
9891,ENDNOTES:,
9892,ENDNOTES:,"With willing hand Gunther, the champion, greeted the heroes of the"
9893,ENDNOTES:,Amelung land. Lord Giselher made many a gleaming helmet red and wet with
9894,ENDNOTES:,"blood. Dankwart, Hagen's brother, a fierce man was he; whatever he had"
9895,ENDNOTES:,done before to Etzel's warriors in strife was as a wind to the fury with
9896,ENDNOTES:,"which bold Aldrian's son now fought. Ritschart (6) and Gerbart, Helfrich"
9897,ENDNOTES:,and Wichart had spared themselves full seldom in many battle storms;
9898,ENDNOTES:,"this they now made Gunther's liegemen note full well. Wolfbrand, too,"
9899,ENDNOTES:,was seen in the strife bearing him in lordly wise. Old Hildebrand fought
9900,ENDNOTES:,"as though he raged. At Wolfhart's hands many good knights, struck by the"
9901,ENDNOTES:,"sword, must needs fall dead down into the blood. Thus the bold champions"
9902,ENDNOTES:,and good avenged Knight Rudeger.
9903,ENDNOTES:,
9904,ENDNOTES:,"Then Lord Siegstab fought as his prowess bade him. Ho, what good helmets"
9905,ENDNOTES:,of his foes this son of Dietrich's sister clove in the strife! Nor
9906,ENDNOTES:,might he ever do better in the fray. When sturdy Folker espied that bold
9907,ENDNOTES:,"Siegstab hewed a bloody stream from the hard armor rings, wroth of mood"
9908,ENDNOTES:,"the hero grew. He sprang to meet him, and Siegstab lost his life full"
9909,ENDNOTES:,"soon at the fiddler's hands, for Folker gave him such a sample of his"
9910,ENDNOTES:,"art, that he soon lay dead, slain by his sword. This old Hildebrand"
9911,ENDNOTES:,"avenged, as his might did bid him."
9912,ENDNOTES:,
9913,ENDNOTES:,"""Alas for my dear lord,"" spake Master Hildebrand, ""who lieth here dead"
9914,ENDNOTES:,"at Folker's hands. Now shall the fiddler no longer live."""
9915,ENDNOTES:,
9916,ENDNOTES:,"How might bold Hildebrand ever be fiercer? Folker he smote, so that"
9917,ENDNOTES:,on all sides the clasps flew to the walls of the hall from helmet and
9918,ENDNOTES:,shield of the doughty gleeman. Thus stout Folker was done to death. At
9919,ENDNOTES:,this the men of Dietrich pressed forward to the strife. They smote so
9920,ENDNOTES:,"that the armor rings whirled far and wide, and high through the air"
9921,ENDNOTES:,the sword-points wore seen to fly. From the helmets they drew the warm
9922,ENDNOTES:,"gushing stream of blood. When Hagen of Troneg saw Folker dead, that was"
9923,ENDNOTES:,"the greatest sorrow, that he had gained at the feasting in kinsman or"
9924,ENDNOTES:,"in liegeman. Alas, how fiercely Hagen gan venge the knight! ""Now old"
9925,ENDNOTES:,Hildebrand shall not profit by this deed. My helpmate lieth slain by the
9926,ENDNOTES:,"hero's hand, the best war comrade that I did ever win."" Higher he raised"

9928,ENDNOTES:,
9929,ENDNOTES:,"Stout Helfrich slew Dankwart. Loth enow it was to Gunther and Giselher,"
9930,ENDNOTES:,"when they saw him fall in cruel need, but with his own hands he himself"
9931,ENDNOTES:,"had well avenged his death. Meanwhile Wolfhart raged back and forth,"
9932,ENDNOTES:,hewing alway King Gunther's men. For the third time he was come through
9933,ENDNOTES:,"the hall, and many a warrior fell, struck by his hands."
9934,ENDNOTES:,
9935,ENDNOTES:,"Then Lord Giselher cried out to Wolfhart: ""Alas, that I have ever gained"

9937,ENDNOTES:,"help to make an end; this may be no longer."""
9938,ENDNOTES:,
9939,ENDNOTES:,"At this Wolfhart turned him in strife to Giselher, and each smote other"
9940,ENDNOTES:,"many a gaping wound. He pressed so mightily toward the king, that"
9941,ENDNOTES:,the blood beneath his feet spurted high above his head. With grim
9942,ENDNOTES:,and fearful blows the son of fair Uta then greeted the brave knight
9943,ENDNOTES:,"Wolfhart. However strong the warrior, he might not save his life. Never"
9944,ENDNOTES:,could so young a king have been more brave; Wolfhart he smote through
9945,ENDNOTES:,"his stout hauberk, that his blood streamed down from the wound. Unto"
9946,ENDNOTES:,death he wounded Dietrich's liegeman. None save a champion had done such
9947,ENDNOTES:,"deed. When brave Wolfhart felt the wound, he let fall his shield and"
9948,ENDNOTES:,lifted higher in his hand his mighty sword (sharp enow it was); through
9949,ENDNOTES:,both helmet and armor rings the hero smote Giselher. Thus each did other
9950,ENDNOTES:,fiercely unto death.
9951,ENDNOTES:,
9952,ENDNOTES:,Now was none left of Dietrich's men. Old Hildebrand saw Wolfhart fall;
9953,ENDNOTES:,"never before his death, I ween, did such dole happen to him. The men of"
9954,ENDNOTES:,"Gunther all lay dead, and those of Dietrich, too. Hildebrand hied him to"
9955,ENDNOTES:,"where Wolfhart had fallen in the gore, and clasped in his arms the brave"
9956,ENDNOTES:,"knight and good. He would fain bear him from the hall, but he was a"
9957,ENDNOTES:,"deal too heavy, and so he must needs let him lie. Then the dying warrior"
9958,ENDNOTES:,"looked upward from the blood in which he lay; well he saw, that his"
9959,ENDNOTES:,"uncle would fain help him hence. Though wounded unto death, he spake:"
9960,ENDNOTES:,"""Dear uncle mine, ye may not aid me now. 'Tis well, methinks, that ye"
9961,ENDNOTES:,should guard you against Hagen. A fierce mood he beareth in his heart.
9962,ENDNOTES:,And if perchance my kinsmen would mourn me after I am dead; pray tell
9963,ENDNOTES:,"the nearest and the best, that they weep not for me; there is no need of"
9964,ENDNOTES:,that. At the hands of a king I have met a glorious death and have also
9965,ENDNOTES:,"avenged me, so that the wives of the good knights may well bewail it. If"
9966,ENDNOTES:,"any ask you of this, ye may boldly say, that full a hundred lie slain by"
9967,ENDNOTES:,"my hand alone."""
9968,ENDNOTES:,
9969,ENDNOTES:,"Then Hagen, too, bethought him of the gleeman, whom bold Hildebrand"
9970,ENDNOTES:,"had robbed of life. To the knight he spake: ""Ye'll requite me now my"
9971,ENDNOTES:,"sorrows. Through your hatred ye have bereft us of many a lusty knight."""
9972,ENDNOTES:,
9973,ENDNOTES:,"He dealt Hildebrand such a blow, that men heard Balmung ring, the which"
9974,ENDNOTES:,"bold Hagen had taken from Siegfried, when he slew the knight. Then the"
9975,ENDNOTES:,old man warded him; in sooth he was brave enow. Dietrich's champion
9976,ENDNOTES:,"struck with a broad sword, that cut full sore, at the hero of Troneg,"
9977,ENDNOTES:,"but could not wound King Gunther's liegeman. Hagen, however, smote him"
9978,ENDNOTES:,"through his well-wrought hauberk. When old Hildebrand felt the wound, he"
9979,ENDNOTES:,feared more scathe at Hagen's hand; his shield he slung across his back
9980,ENDNOTES:,"and thus Sir Dietrich's man escaped from Hagen, though sorely wounded."
9981,ENDNOTES:,
9982,ENDNOTES:,"Now of all the knights none was alive save the twain, Gunther and"
9983,ENDNOTES:,Hagen alone. Dripping with blood old Hildebrand went to where he found
9984,ENDNOTES:,"Dietrich, and told him the baleful tale. He saw him sitting sadly, but"
9985,ENDNOTES:,much more of dole the prince now gained. He spied Hildebrand in his
9986,ENDNOTES:,"blood-red hauberk, and asked him tidings, as his fears did prompt him."
