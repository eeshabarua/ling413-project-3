222,DEDICATION.,"""Who is yonder light-haired stranger"
223,DEDICATION.,Who there like a cat is roaming
224,DEDICATION.,"O'er the roof of Don Pagano?""--"
225,DEDICATION.,"Thus asked many honest burghers,"
226,DEDICATION.,"Dwellers on the Isle of Capri,"
227,DEDICATION.,When they from the market turning
228,DEDICATION.,Looked up at the palm-tree and the
229,DEDICATION.,Low-arched roof of moorish fashion.
230,DEDICATION.,
231,DEDICATION.,And the worthy Don Pagano
232,DEDICATION.,"Said: ""That is a strange queer fellow,"
233,DEDICATION.,And most strange his occupation.
234,DEDICATION.,"Came here with but little luggage,"
235,DEDICATION.,"Lives here quite alone but happy,"
236,DEDICATION.,"Clambers up the steepest mountains,"
237,DEDICATION.,"Over cliffs, through surf is strolling,"
238,DEDICATION.,Loves to steal along the sea-shore.
239,DEDICATION.,Also lately 'mid the ruins
240,DEDICATION.,Of the villa of Tiberius
241,DEDICATION.,With the hermits there caroused.
242,DEDICATION.,"What's his business?--He's a German,"
243,DEDICATION.,And who knows what they are doing?
244,DEDICATION.,But I saw upon his table
245,DEDICATION.,"Heaps of paper written over,"
246,DEDICATION.,Leaving very wasteful margins;
247,DEDICATION.,"I believe he is half crazy,"
248,DEDICATION.,"I believe he's making verses."""
249,DEDICATION.,
250,DEDICATION.,Thus he spoke.--And I myself was
251,DEDICATION.,This queer stranger. Solitary
252,DEDICATION.,I had on this rocky island
253,DEDICATION.,Sung this song of my dear Schwarzwald.
254,DEDICATION.,I went as a wand'ring scholar
255,DEDICATION.,"To far countries, to Italia;"
256,DEDICATION.,"With much art became acquainted,"
257,DEDICATION.,"Also with bad vetturinos,"
258,DEDICATION.,And with many burning flea-bites;
259,DEDICATION.,"But the sweet fruit of the lotus,"
260,DEDICATION.,Which doth banish love of country
261,DEDICATION.,"And the longing to return there,"
262,DEDICATION.,I have never found here growing.
263,DEDICATION.,
264,DEDICATION.,'Twas in Rome. Hard lay the winter
265,DEDICATION.,On th' eternal sev'n-hilled city:
266,DEDICATION.,Hard? for even Marcus Brutus
267,DEDICATION.,Would have caught a bad catarrh then;
268,DEDICATION.,And the rain seemed never-ending.
269,DEDICATION.,Like a dream then rose the vision
270,DEDICATION.,"Of the Schwarzwald, and the story"
271,DEDICATION.,Of the young musician Werner
272,DEDICATION.,And the lovely Margaretta.
273,DEDICATION.,In my youth I have stood often
274,DEDICATION.,By their graves close to the Rhine shore;
275,DEDICATION.,Many things which lie there buried
276,DEDICATION.,"Are, however, long forgotten."
277,DEDICATION.,But like one to whom a sudden
278,DEDICATION.,Ringing in his ears betokens
279,DEDICATION.,"That at home of him they're thinking,"
280,DEDICATION.,So I heard young Werner's trumpet
281,DEDICATION.,"Through the Roman Winter, through the"
282,DEDICATION.,Carnival's gay flower-show--
283,DEDICATION.,"Heard it from afar, then nearer,"
284,DEDICATION.,Like the crystal which of vap'rous
285,DEDICATION.,Fine materials is condensing
286,DEDICATION.,And increases radiating;
287,DEDICATION.,So the figures of this song grew--
288,DEDICATION.,Even followed me to Naples.
289,DEDICATION.,In the halls of the Museum
290,DEDICATION.,Who should meet me but the Baron
291,DEDICATION.,"Shaking his big cane and smiling,"
292,DEDICATION.,And before Pompeii's gate sat
293,DEDICATION.,The black tom-cat Hiddigeigei.
294,DEDICATION.,"Purring, quoth he: ""Leave all study;"
295,DEDICATION.,"What is all this ancient rubbish,"
296,DEDICATION.,E'en that dog there in mosaic
297,DEDICATION.,"In the tragic Poet's dwelling,"
298,DEDICATION.,In comparison with me--the
299,DEDICATION.,"Epic type of all cat-nature?"""
300,DEDICATION.,
301,DEDICATION.,"This I could no longer stand, so"
302,DEDICATION.,Now began this ghost to banish.
303,DEDICATION.,From the brother of the lovely
304,DEDICATION.,"Luisella, from the crooked"
305,DEDICATION.,Cunning druggist of Sorrento
306,DEDICATION.,"Quantities of ink I ordered,"
307,DEDICATION.,And sailed o'er the bay to Capri.
308,DEDICATION.,Here began my exorcisms.
309,DEDICATION.,"Many pale-gold coloured sea-fish,"
310,DEDICATION.,"Many lobsters, many oysters,"
311,DEDICATION.,I ate up without compassion;
312,DEDICATION.,"Drank the red wine like Tiberius,"
313,DEDICATION.,Without mercy poetising;
314,DEDICATION.,On the roof went up and down till
315,DEDICATION.,"All resounded metrically,"
316,DEDICATION.,And the charm was then accomplished:
317,DEDICATION.,Chained up in four-measured trochees
318,DEDICATION.,Lay those figures which so long now
319,DEDICATION.,From my couch sweet sleep had banished.
320,DEDICATION.,
321,DEDICATION.,"'Twas high time, too; Spring already"
322,DEDICATION.,Now gave signal of his coming--
323,DEDICATION.,Buds were sprouting on the fig-trees;
324,DEDICATION.,"Shots were cracking, for with guns and"
325,DEDICATION.,"Nets they were the quails pursuing,"
326,DEDICATION.,Who towards home their flight were taking;
327,DEDICATION.,And the minstrel was in peril
328,DEDICATION.,Then of seeing feathered colleagues
329,DEDICATION.,Set upon the table roasted.
330,DEDICATION.,"This dread o'er him, pen and inkstand"
331,DEDICATION.,Flew against the wall together.
332,DEDICATION.,Ready now and newly soled were
333,DEDICATION.,My strong boots which old Vesuvius
334,DEDICATION.,Had much damaged with his sulphur.
335,DEDICATION.,Farther now I journey onward.
336,DEDICATION.,"Up, my good old Marinaro!"
337,DEDICATION.,Off from land! the waves with pleasure
338,DEDICATION.,Bear light hearts and weightless freightage.
339,DEDICATION.,
340,DEDICATION.,"But the song, which with such happy"
341,DEDICATION.,"Spring-born feelings from my heart welled,"
342,DEDICATION.,Bears my greetings to my country
343,DEDICATION.,"And to you, my honoured parents."
344,DEDICATION.,"Many faults are in it, truly:"
345,DEDICATION.,"Tragic pathos may be wanting,"
346,DEDICATION.,"And a racy tendance; also,"
347,DEDICATION.,"As in Amaranth, the fragrant"
348,DEDICATION.,"Incense of a pious soul, its"
349,DEDICATION.,Sober but pretentious colouring.
350,DEDICATION.,"Take him, as he is, this ruddy."
351,DEDICATION.,"Rough, uncouth son of the mountains,"
352,DEDICATION.,With a pine branch on his straw hat.
353,DEDICATION.,"What he's wanting in, pray, cover"
354,DEDICATION.,With the veil of kind indulgence.
355,DEDICATION.,"Take him not as thanks, for always"
356,DEDICATION.,"In your Book of Love I'm debtor,"
357,DEDICATION.,"But as greeting and as witness,"
358,DEDICATION.,That a man whom worldly fortune
359,DEDICATION.,"Has not placed 'mid smiling verdure,"
360,DEDICATION.,"Yet can, happy as a lark pour"
361,DEDICATION.,Out his song on leafless branches.

373,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
374,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
375,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Five years, my merry song, have now rolled by"
376,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Since thou didst venture thy first course to run,"
377,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"A simple strolling minstrel's chance to try,"
378,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,But no great laurels so far hast thou won.
379,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,In circles of prosaic breathing mortals
380,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,No praise was given thee of any kind--
381,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Where formal stiffness bars life's glowing portals,"
382,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Thou and thy kindred can no quarter find.
383,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And in the coteries of hoops and laces
384,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Few were the readers, fewer still the praises."
385,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
386,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Not everything suits everyone: the hill
387,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Grows different flowers than the vale and lea:
388,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,But here and there in German homes there will
389,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Be found some hearts who fondly turn to thee;
390,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Where merry fellows are their wine enjoying
391,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"With cheerful songs, thy praises will resound;"
392,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Near landscape-painters' easels thou art lying,"
393,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"And in a huntsman's bag thou oft art found,"
394,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And e'en of pastors it has been reported
395,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,To thee as to their prayer-books they've resorted.
396,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
397,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
398,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And many who have taken a young bride
399,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"To spend the honeymoon 'midst rural scenes,"
400,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Do like to read thee, sitting side by side;"
401,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Of happy hours thou often art the means.
402,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Then Säkkingen, the fair Black Forest's treasure,"
403,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Which found at first in thee not much delight,"
404,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Has by degrees derived from thee great pleasure,"
405,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And to her heart with love has pressed thee tight.
406,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Upon the whole, success outweighs detraction,"
407,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And thou canst view thy fate with satisfaction.
408,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
409,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
410,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Now that thou wilt a second course begin,"
411,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"I should for thee a better dress prepare,"
412,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"With finer threads the verses' measure spin,"
413,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Here lengthen out, there shorten with more care,"
414,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"I know it well, right often have I faltered,"
415,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Some of thy trochees sound a little lame;
416,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"But the old humour now, alas! is altered,"
417,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,The mood which gave thee birth is not the same.
418,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"O rosy dreams of youth, when joy abounded,"
419,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,Wherefore so soon by gloomy clouds surrounded!
420,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
421,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
422,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Once more in my dear Schwarzwald I now rest,"
423,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"And near me rush the healing waters out,"
424,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"On high a bird of prey soars o'er his nest,"
425,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And in the brook are sporting tiny trout.
426,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"From charcoal kilns the smoke clouds are ascending,"
427,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"With iris-coloured hues the sun embrace,"
428,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"And stately giant pines in rows unending,"
429,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Like wreaths of evergreens, the mountains grace."
430,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"A spicy hay-scent rises from the meadow,"
431,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And honest folk dwell 'neath their thatched roof's
432,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,shadow.
433,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
434,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
435,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"And yet--should I now try new songs to sing,"
436,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,The old accustomed tone I could not find;
437,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Too often grief my soul with pangs doth wring,"
438,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Instead of mirth, scorn filleth now my mind."
439,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"The world serves idols now, the good ignoring,"
440,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"And truth is silent, beauty hides her face;"
441,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"What is unnatural men are adoring,"
442,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,God is forgotten. Mammon takes his place!
443,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"The Poet, now, should be a prophet warning,"
444,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Like those of old, reproving, praying, mourning!"
445,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
446,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,
447,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,'Tis not _my_ sphere; a mighty stirring song
448,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Requires another man, a different art;"
449,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,But though so much prevails that's sad and wrong.
450,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,One may not quite disdain a merry heart.
451,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Go forth, my song, then, as thou didst before,"
452,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,A cheerful memory of life's fresh spring;
453,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Cheer up those hearts, which grief made sad and sore,"
454,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,And to friends far and near my greeting bring.
455,TO THE SECOND EDITION.,"Whenever men to nobler aims aspire,"

1299,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"I, however, must confess here,"
1300,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,That I did not choose the finest

1302,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"What I liked, was to sit drinking"

1310,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Who had out of life's wild whirlpool
1311,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Peacefully withdrawn himself where
1312,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"He could meditate while drinking,"
1313,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And the cellar was his refuge.
1314,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Here he lived, his care dividing"
1315,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,'Twixt himself and the big wine-tun;
1316,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And he loved it--truer friendship
1317,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Never has the world yet witnessed;
1318,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,'Twas as if it were his bride.
1319,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"With a broom he swept it shining,"
1320,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Chased away the ugly spiders,"
1321,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"And whenever came a feast-day,"
1322,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Hung it o'er with wreaths of ivy;
1323,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Sang to it the morning greeting,"
1324,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Also sang the song of evening,"
1325,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And he carved in wood the image
1326,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Of himself as his best offering.
1327,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,But when sipping his reward then
1328,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"From the big tun's mouth with kisses,"
1329,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Forth he launched in flights of fancy.
1330,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Often at his feet I listened

1342,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,In a concrete form together.
1343,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Thus we comprehend the world well;
1344,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,For this purpose I am drinking
1345,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Truly cosmogonically.
1346,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Mundane space to me is nothing
1347,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"But a roomy vaulted cellar,"
1348,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Where as first and central wine-tun,"
1349,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Firmly stands the sun erected!
1350,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Next to him the rank and file of
1351,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Smaller casks, fixed stars and planets."
1352,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,As the divers casks are holding
1353,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Wines of various sorts and flavours,"
1354,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,So comprise the heavenly bodies
1355,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Various spiritual natures.
1356,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Land-wine this--that Rüdesheimer;
1357,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,But the earth-cask holds a mixture;
1358,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Fermentation has half clouded
1359,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And half volatilised the spirit
1360,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,The antagony of matter
1361,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"And of spirit is, by thinking,"
1362,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Blended into higher union.
1363,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Thus soars my creative genius
1364,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Far on high, while I am drinking."
1365,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And when through my brain are rushing
1366,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Revelations from the wine-fumes,"
1367,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And when then my feeble body
1368,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Tottering sinks down by the wine-tun,"
1369,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"'Tis the triumph of the spirit,"
1370,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,'Tis the act of self-deliverance
1371,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,From the narrow bounds of being.
1372,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Thus my solitude doth teach me
1373,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Nature's everlasting system.
1374,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"With mankind it would be better,"
1375,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Had the great Germanic race but

1378,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"High the standard of the wine-cask,"
1379,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Made of drinking a devotion--
1380,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,As the Persians worship fire!'
1381,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,O Perkéo! better were it
1382,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Now with me, if to thy wisdom"

1384,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"'Twas a sharp cold winter morning,"
1385,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,When down in the cosy cellar
1386,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"We were taking a potation,"
1387,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Talking philosophically;

1389,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,The whole world and everybody
1390,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Looked most strangely queer and funny.
1391,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Rosy hues lit up all Nature,"
1392,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Angel-voices I heard plainly.
1393,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,On the balcony of the castle
1394,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Stood surrounded by her ladies,"

1397,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Up to her start my bold glances,"
1398,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Up to her my daring longing;
1399,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Clouded was my understanding.
1400,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,Quickly I approached the terrace
1401,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,And began to sing the wild air
1402,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"Which the Palsgrave Frederic once sang,"
1403,YOUNG WERNER WITH THE SCHWARZWALD PASTOR.,"As a love-sick serenader,"

1716,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And they understood that giving
1717,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Is more blessed than receiving;
1718,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,That it was the Son of God who
1719,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,On the cross for men did suffer.

1725,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Peacefully there on the island,"
1726,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Sword, and shield, and axe they laid down;"
1727,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And the children gaily gathered
1728,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,For themselves the willow blossoms
1729,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And sweet violets by the river.
1730,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"From his hut came Fridolinus,"
1731,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Fully robed in priestly vestments;
1732,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,By his side walked his companions
1733,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Who had come from distant places:
1734,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Gallas from Helvetia; also
1735,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,From the Bodensee Columban.
1736,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And they led down to the shore then
1737,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"The great throng of the converted,"
1738,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And baptised them in the name of
1739,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
1740,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1741,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1742,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,She alone did not come with them
1743,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"To the isle of Fridolinus,"
1744,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,She the old and stubborn grandam;
1745,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"And she said: ""No new gods need I,"
1746,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,As my life is fast declining.
1747,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"I'm contented with the old ones,"
1748,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Who to me are kind and gracious,"
1749,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Who once gave me my dear husband--

1751,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"When'er Death from here should take me,"
1752,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,I could never hope to find him;
1753,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And for him my heart is yearning.

1755,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Where the mandrake grows 'neath fir-trees
1756,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Which with mistletoe are covered.

1763,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And afar throughout the country

1765,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,When again he paid a visit
1766,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"To King Clovis' court, in Paris,"
1767,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"On his right the king did place him,"
1768,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And then solemnly donated
1769,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"The whole island to his cloister,"
1770,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"And, besides, large tracts of country;"
1771,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Even a great saint became he.
1772,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Have ye never heard the legend

1776,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"A great saint, indeed, became he,"
1777,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And is still the Rhineland's patron.
1778,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,To this day prevails the custom

1788,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Wished him a most pleasant journey.
1789,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And the old cook was completely
1790,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Reconciled unto the stranger;
1791,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Bashfully she cast her eyes down
1792,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"To the ground, while deeply blushing,"
1793,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"When young Werner, out of mischief,"
1794,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Kissed his hand to her, when leaving."
1795,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Barking ran the two St. Bernards

1798,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1799,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Bright and warm the sun was shining

1802,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"From the organ of the minster,"
1803,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,As young Werner through the gate rode.
1804,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Quickly found he first good shelter
1805,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"For his horse, and then he walked on"
1806,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"To the crowded lively market,"
1807,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Went up to the old Cathedral,"
1808,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And he stood with head uncovered
1809,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"By the portal, where was passing"
1810,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Then the festive long procession.
1811,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1812,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1813,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Through the war the precious relics
1814,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Of the Saint had been well hidden
1815,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,In old Laufenburg's strong castle.
1816,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,They had often in the city
1817,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Missed their presence with much sorrow.
1818,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Now that peace once more was settled,"
1819,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,They were striving with fresh ardour
1820,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,To do honour to their saint.
1821,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,At the head of the procession
1822,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Came gay troops of merry children.
1823,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"But when they too loudly prattled,"
1824,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Then their old and gray-haired teacher
1825,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Pulled them by the ear and scolded:

1827,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Take great care, for Fridolinus"
1828,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,May be listening to your gabbling.
1829,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"He, a Saint severe and holy,"
1830,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Will complain of you in Heaven."""
1831,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Twelve young men came next, who bore the"
1832,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Coffin, rich with gold and silver,"
1833,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Which enclosed the Saint's remains.
1834,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Bearing it they chanted softly:
1835,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1836,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1837,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Thou who dwellest high in Heaven,"
1838,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Bless thy people and thy city,"

1845,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1846,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,
1847,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Then the Dean and all the Chaplains
1848,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Followed after--bearing tapers
1849,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Came the youthful Burgomaster,"
1850,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Came the town's wise Corporation
1851,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And the other dignitaries:
1852,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Bailiff, Revenue-receiver,"
1853,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Syndic, Notary, Attorney,"

1859,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,E'en the Messenger and Sergeant

1864,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Ornamented with white crosses,"
1865,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Came the great Teutonic Order,"
1866,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,All the Knights and their Commander.
1867,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Down the river stood in Beuggen

1875,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And in front by the blue standard
1876,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Walked the aged Lady Abbess,"
1877,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"And her thoughts were: ""Fridolinus,"

1886,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And I hope it is forgiven.
1887,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Deeply wrinkled is my forehead,"
1888,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,While the cheeks and lips are faded.

1893,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Came the burghers' comely housewives,"
1894,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,At the end the elder matrons.
1895,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Only one in work-day garments
1896,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Kept aloof from the procession,"
1897,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,'Twas the hostess from the ancient
1898,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Tavern of the ""Golden Button;"""
1899,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,So demanded ancient custom.
1900,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,There--so learn we from the legend--
1901,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Stood once in those heathen ages
1902,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"An old tavern; Fridolinus,"
1903,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,When he first upon the island
1904,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Set his foot, had there sought shelter;"
1905,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"But the landlord, a rude heathen,"
1906,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Spoke unto the holy man thus:
1907,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"""All you priests are good for nothing,"
1908,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,But to vilify our old gods;
1909,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And you seldom carry even
1910,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,One red farthing in your pocket.
1911,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"So begone from off my threshold!"""
1912,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Now the purse of Fridolinus
1913,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Had indeed but little in it,"
1914,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And he had to take his night's rest
1915,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Underneath the shady lindens
1916,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,In the meadow. But the angels
1917,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Cared well for him, and he found out,"
1918,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"On awaking, that his purse was"
1919,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Filled with golden Roman pieces.
1920,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Then again the Saint did visit
1921,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"The inhospitable tavern,"
1922,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Took a meal, and paid in shining"
1923,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Money what the host demanded;
1924,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,And to shame him left moreover
1925,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Seven gold coins as a present.
1926,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Thus for an eternal warning
1927,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"To all landlords void of pity,"
1928,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"Although ages had elapsed since,"
1929,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,"No one from the ""Golden Button"""

1957,ST. FRIDOLIN'S DAY.,Where young Werner now was standing.

3440,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"All around reigned holy silence,"
3441,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Only heard there was the hammering
3442,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Of the pecker on the pine-trees.
3443,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Through the fallen leaves and mosses
3444,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Rustled softly emerald lizards,"
3445,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And with clever questioning glances
3446,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Curiously they eyed the stranger.
3447,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3448,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3449,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Yes, I often lay there dreaming;"

3457,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Heart overwhelming, mind bewildering,"

3459,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And they beckoned me to come there.
3460,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But the fir-tree held and warned me:

3467,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Since those days I've been a wanderer:
3468,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"I have climbed up many mountains,"
3469,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And through many lands have travelled,"
3470,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Looked upon the restless ocean,"
3471,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And have heard the Sirens singing;
3472,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But yet often through my memory
3473,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Steal the lake's sweet soothing murmurs,"
3474,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And soft whispers from the fir-trees,"
3475,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Home, and love, and youth recalling."
3476,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3477,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3478,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Now there was a noisy thronging,"
3479,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Running, shouting, laughing, joking,"
3480,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Down beneath there on the shore.

3487,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,There behind the rocks a boat lay
3488,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"In the reeds with brushwood covered,"
3489,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And with chains securely fastened,"
3490,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"That no poachers should disturb it,"
3491,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Who might come along at midnight,"
3492,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And employ it for their fishing.
3493,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,From its hiding-place they dragged it
3494,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Onward to the lake-shore, and there"
3495,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Placed the heavy net within it.
3496,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Closely netted were the meshes
3497,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Of the coarsest twine, while many"
3498,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Leaden weights thereon were fastened.
3499,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"When they tried the boat for leakage,"
3500,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Although somewhat out of order,"
3501,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,They pronounced it quite seaworthy.
3502,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Now the landlord and five comrades,"
3503,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Gay and hopeful, took their places,"
3504,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And one end of the great net threw
3505,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"To some friends on shore remaining,"
3506,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,With the charge to hold it tightly.
3507,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"From the shore they pushed away now,"
3508,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Rowing stoutly as the net sank
3509,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Slowly down in a wide curve;
3510,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Then returned with speed much lessened,"
3511,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Always dragging on the heavy
3512,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Bulky net, so that the fishes"
3513,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Might therein become entangled.
3514,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"On the shore they sprang out quickly,"
3515,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And drew after them the netting,"
3516,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Till they nigh approached those friends who
3517,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Still upon the shore were waiting.
3518,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Stoutly pulling back the ends, they"
3519,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Raised the net out of the water,"
3520,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,In great hopes of lots of booty.
3521,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But within itself entangled
3522,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,It came slowly to the surface
3523,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Empty: some unskilful rower
3524,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Had prevented it from sinking,"
3525,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And the dwellers of the lake laughed
3526,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,To have just escaped such danger.
3527,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Now the landlord cast sharp glances
3528,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Over all the meshes. Nothing
3529,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Met his anxious gaze but water;
3530,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Not the smallest fish was caught there;
3531,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Only an old boot half rotten,"
3532,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And a toad half crushed and flattened,"
3533,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Which with eyes protruding oddly
3534,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Looked upon the sunlit forest,"
3535,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And the human faces round him,"
3536,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And he thought: ""It is most truly"
3537,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Wonderful, how anybody"

3539,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,With this sky and this bright sunlight!
3540,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Well, it seems to me no one here"
3541,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,E'er can have the slightest notion

3543,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Would I were in my own element!"""
3544,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3545,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3546,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Those who stood upon the lake-shore
3547,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Raised a long and roaring laughter
3548,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,At these first-fruits of the fishing.
3549,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"But in rage broke out the landlord,"
3550,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,O'er their laughter rang his scolding:
3551,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"""Stupid fellows, bunglers, numskulls!"""
3552,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And with angry kicks he sent then
3553,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"All the booty flying swiftly,"
3554,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Boot and toad in peace together
3555,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,To the water where they came from.
3556,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Loudly splashing they sank downward.
3557,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3558,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3559,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But the disappointed fishers
3560,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Would again now try their fortune,"
3561,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Loosened all the tangled meshes,"
3562,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And with greatest care they lowered
3563,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Then the net and raised it slowly.
3564,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And to do so there were needed
3565,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Many sturdy pulls and struggles.
3566,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Ringing shouts and cries of triumph
3567,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Greeted this successful fishing.
3568,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,From the rock came down the Baron
3569,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"To the fishers, and the ladies"
3570,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Eagerly made haste to follow.
3571,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Over rocks and thorny brambles
3572,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,To the shore they found a pathway.
3573,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Margaretta followed also,"
3574,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Notwithstanding her long habit.
3575,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"When young Werner saw her coming,"
3576,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Bashfully his arm he offered,"
3577,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And bewildered were his senses.
3578,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,So Sir Walter Raleigh's heart once
3579,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Must have beaten, when his mantle"
3580,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,He made use of as a carpet
3581,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,For his gracious royal mistress.
3582,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Yet with thanks fair Margaretta
3583,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Werner's arm and aid accepted.
3584,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Out there in the verdant forest
3585,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Many useless scruples vanish,"
3586,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Which oft elsewhere greatly trouble
3587,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Masters of the ceremonies.
3588,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"The descent there was not easy,"
3589,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And no other arm was near her.
3590,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3591,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3592,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,By the lake they gaily looked now
3593,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,At the fishing booty struggling.
3594,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Flapping in the net's strong meshes
3595,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Were the captives. Many snapping
3596,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Sought a way still for escaping,"
3597,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But on the bare sand were landed;
3598,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And thus fruitless was their trial.
3599,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Those who felt toward each other
3600,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"In the depths such bitter hatred,"
3601,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Now as captives were quite peaceful:
3602,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Snake-like eels, so smooth and slippery,"
3603,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Well-fed carps with huge broad noses,"
3604,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And the pirate-fish, the slender"
3605,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Pike with jaws large and voracious.
3606,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"As in war, the harmless peasants"
3607,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Often to stray shots fall victims,"
3608,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,So the fate of being captured
3609,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Many others overtook:
3610,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Handsome barbels, spotted gudgeons;"
3611,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Tiny bleaks, the river-swallow;"
3612,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And through all this crowd of fishes
3613,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Sluggishly the crab was creeping;
3614,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Inwardly he sadly grumbled:
3615,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"""Caught together, hung together."""
3616,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3617,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3618,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Well contented said the Baron:
3619,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"""After labour comes amusement."
3620,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Seems to me, that our fresh booty"
3621,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Will taste better in the forest.
3622,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Therefore let us now make ready
3623,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"For ourselves a rustic dinner."""
3624,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"To these words they all assented,"
3625,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And the landlord of the ""Button"""
3626,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Sent out two fleet-footed fellows
3627,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,To the city with the order:
3628,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"""Two large pans bring quickly hither;"
3629,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Bring me golden fresh-made butter,"
3630,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Also bread, and salt sufficient,"
3631,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And a keg of fine old wine.
3632,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Bring me lemons too, and sugar;"
3633,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,For I feel a premonition
3634,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"As if May-drink would be wanted."""
3635,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Off they started. Under shelter
3636,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Of a rock with a tall pine-tree,"
3637,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Some the hearth were getting ready,"
3638,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Bringing there dry boughs and fagots,"
3639,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Loads of furze and moss together.
3640,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Others now prepared the fishes
3641,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"For the feast, and all the ladies"
3642,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Gathered herbs of spicy fragrance,"
3643,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Such as thyme and leaves of strawberries;
3644,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Also gathered for the May-wine
3645,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,The white-blooming fragrant woodroof.
3646,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Which rejoiced at being broken
3647,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"By such tender hands, and thought thus:"
3648,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"""Sweet it was in these dark pine-woods,"
3649,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"To be blooming, 'mid the rocks here,"
3650,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But still sweeter in the May-time
3651,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"'Tis to die, and with the last breath"
3652,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Highly then to spice the May-wine
3653,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,For the joy of human beings.
3654,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Death in general is corruption,"
3655,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,But the woodroof's death is like that
3656,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Of the morning-dew on blossoms,"
3657,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Sweetly, without sighs, exhaling."""
3658,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,From the town returning quickly
3659,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Came the two fleet-footed fellows,"
3660,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Bringing stores, as had been ordered."
3661,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And soon crackled on the stone-hearth
3662,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Cheerfully a blazing fire.
3663,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,In the pans were frying briskly
3664,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,What had recently been swimming.
3665,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,First a mighty pike was served up
3666,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"To the ladies by the landlord,"
3667,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,As a show of rustic cooking;
3668,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And a solemn earnest silence
3669,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Soon gave evidence that all were
3670,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Very busy with the banquet.
3671,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Only the confused low sounds of
3672,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Gnawing fish-bones, munching crab-claws,"
3673,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Now disturbed the forest quiet.
3674,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3675,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3676,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Meanwhile, farther up, delicious"
3677,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Fragrant May-wine was preparing.
3678,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,In a bowl of size capacious
3679,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Margaretta's taste artistic
3680,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Well had brewed it; mild and spicy,"
3681,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,As sweet May himself the drink was.
3682,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Every glass she filled up, kindly"
3683,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Helping all with graceful bearing.
3684,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Everybody got his share, and"
3685,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,All were merry round the fire.
3686,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3687,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,
3688,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,There the city-teacher also
3689,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Stretched himself upon the grass-bank.
3690,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"From the school he had absconded,"
3691,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Also to enjoy the fishing.
3692,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"In his heart he bore a secret,"
3693,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Had to-day composed a song.
3694,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"May-wine, May-wine, drink of magic!"
3695,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Suddenly his cheeks were glowing,"
3696,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,And his eyes were shining brightly.
3697,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"On the rock he sprang courageous,"
3698,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Saying: ""I will sing you something."""
3699,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Smiling now, the others listened,"
3700,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"And young Werner stepping forward,"
3701,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,On his trumpet low and softly
3702,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Blew a piece first as a prelude.
3703,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Then upon the rock the teacher
3704,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Raised his voice and sang with fervour.
3705,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Werner joined him on the trumpet
3706,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,"Clear and joyful, and the chorus"
3707,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Also fell in--clear and joyful
3708,THE EXCURSION TO THE MOUNTAIN LAKE.,Through the forest rang the

3717,MAY SONG.,"The fresh young green decks hill and lea,"
3718,MAY SONG.,"The birds are singing merrily,"
3719,MAY SONG.,While falls in gentle showers
3720,MAY SONG.,A rain of snow-white flowers.
3721,MAY SONG.,"So in the woods we sing and shout,"

3725,MAY SONG.,
3726,MAY SONG.,
3727,MAY SONG.,"""Young May in humming sounds delights,"

3732,MAY SONG.,Of spring the fairest sweetest prize;
3733,MAY SONG.,Their bells in tuneful measure
3734,MAY SONG.,Ring in the May with pleasure.
3735,MAY SONG.,"So in the woods we sing and shout,"

3740,MAY SONG.,
3741,MAY SONG.,"""Now everyone may think, who can,"

3745,MAY SONG.,His shouts resound across the Rhine:
3746,MAY SONG.,"'O let me in, thou sweetheart mine!'"
3747,MAY SONG.,And voices loud are crying;
3748,MAY SONG.,Love's darts in May are flying.
3749,MAY SONG.,So in the woods we sing and shout

3757,MAY SONG.,Also seemed delighted with it;
3758,MAY SONG.,"As, indeed, in the loud chorus"
3759,MAY SONG.,Many gentle female voices
3760,MAY SONG.,Readily could be distinguished.

3769,MAY SONG.,"Played the fine accompaniment."""
3770,MAY SONG.,
3771,MAY SONG.,
3772,MAY SONG.,"Said the Baron: ""In this matter"
3773,MAY SONG.,I will give a just decision.
3774,MAY SONG.,Ever the first prize is given
3775,MAY SONG.,To the poet; but a garland
3776,MAY SONG.,"Or a laurel-crown, what are they?"
3777,MAY SONG.,I agree with the old Grecians
3778,MAY SONG.,Who awarded to the singer
3779,MAY SONG.,"Just the victim's fattest portion,"
3780,MAY SONG.,As the saddle or the buttock.
3781,MAY SONG.,And I fancy that the teacher's
3782,MAY SONG.,"Stores are not so well provided,"
3783,MAY SONG.,That he'll offer an objection.
3784,MAY SONG.,Therefore I make him a present
3785,MAY SONG.,"Of the largest pike and carp, which"
3786,MAY SONG.,Still are left among our booty.
3787,MAY SONG.,"But as my young friend, the trumpeter,"
3788,MAY SONG.,"Seems disposed less practically,"
3789,MAY SONG.,"So you may, in my opinion,"
3790,MAY SONG.,Honour him with your fair garland;
3791,MAY SONG.,"For, indeed, he played not badly."""
3792,MAY SONG.,
3793,MAY SONG.,
3794,MAY SONG.,Simpering now the happy singer
3795,MAY SONG.,"Rubbed his hands and blessed the May-time,"
3796,MAY SONG.,As he saw a glowing vision
3797,MAY SONG.,Of the pan with fishes frying.
3798,MAY SONG.,But young Werner to the maiden
3799,MAY SONG.,"Bashfully approached, and lowly"
3800,MAY SONG.,"Bending on his knee, he hardly"
3801,MAY SONG.,Dared to gaze at her blue eyes.
3802,MAY SONG.,But with grace placed Margaretta
3803,MAY SONG.,"On his brow the blooming garland,"
3804,MAY SONG.,While a weird and lurid fire-light
3805,MAY SONG.,Suddenly in fitful flashes
3806,MAY SONG.,Fell upon the group assembled.
3807,MAY SONG.,For the embers on the hearth-stone
3808,MAY SONG.,Had ignited the old pine-tree.
3809,MAY SONG.,Flaming fiery tongues now glided
3810,MAY SONG.,Through the branches full of resin;
3811,MAY SONG.,And the sparks flew crackling upward
3812,MAY SONG.,Wildly to the evening sky.
3813,MAY SONG.,
3814,MAY SONG.,
3815,MAY SONG.,"Margaretta, Margaretta!"
3816,MAY SONG.,Were they fireworks which the pine woods
3817,MAY SONG.,Fondly burned to do thee honour?
3818,MAY SONG.,Or did Cupid with his flaming
3819,MAY SONG.,Love-torch wander through the forest?
3820,MAY SONG.,But the flames were soon extinguished.
3821,MAY SONG.,And the Baron now gave orders
3822,MAY SONG.,That the party should break up; and
3823,MAY SONG.,"Fishers, riders, noble ladies,"
3824,MAY SONG.,All went homeward in the twilight.
3825,MAY SONG.,Faintly glimmering fell the last bright

3871,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,In the studio of Albini
3872,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,He became a colour-mixer;

3946,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,But he drank himself the red wine.
3947,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And his compositions truly

3959,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Then the Judgment came of Paris;

3982,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,To inaugurate with music
3983,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,This so beautified pavilion.
3984,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Ha! how Werner's heart was beating,"
3985,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,When he heard the maid's desire.
3986,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,He directly went to Basel
3987,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,To select the new productions

3992,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Whose sweet pastoral composition
3993,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Carried off the prize in music.
3994,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Then there was a noisy bustle
3995,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,'Mongst the artists of the city;
3996,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And a most increasing practice
3997,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"In the frequent long rehearsals,"

4008,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Meanwhile many hands were busy
4009,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Decorating the pavilion
4010,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"With fresh garlands, and were placing"
4011,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Rows of music-desks in order.
4012,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4013,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4014,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,By degrees there came now gliding
4015,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Through the side-gate by the river
4016,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,All the musical performers.
4017,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"First, the youthful burgomaster"
4018,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Bending under the unwieldy
4019,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Contra-bass, whose sounds sonorous"
4020,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Often from his thoughts did banish
4021,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"All the cares of his high office,"
4022,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And the council's stupid blunders.
4023,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Next there came the bloated chaplain
4024,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Who played finely on the violin,"
4025,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Drawing from it such shrill wailings,"
4026,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,As if wishing to give utterance
4027,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,To his lonely bachelor's heart.
4028,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,With his horn beneath his arm came
4029,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"The receiver's clerk, who often,"
4030,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"A great bore to his superior,"
4031,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,With his playing did enliven
4032,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"All the dry accounts he summed up,"
4033,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And the dulness of subtraction.
4034,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"There came also stepping slowly,"
4035,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Dressed in black, but shabby looking,"
4036,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"With a hat the worse for usage,"

4038,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Who by Art consoled himself for
4039,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"What was wanting in his income,"
4040,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And instead of wine and roast beef
4041,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Lived upon his flute's sweet music.
4042,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Then came--Who can count, however,"
4043,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,All these instrumental players?
4044,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,All the talent of the city
4045,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,For this concert had united.
4046,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,From the ironworks of Albbruck
4047,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Even came the superintendent;
4048,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,He alone played the viola.
4049,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4050,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4051,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Like a troop of mounted warriors
4052,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Who the enemy expecting,"
4053,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Lurk in safe and hidden ambush,"
4054,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,So they waited for the Baron
4055,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,To arrive. And like good marksmen
4056,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Who with care before the battle
4057,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Try their weapons, if their powder"
4058,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"By the dew has not been damaged,"
4059,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,If the flint is good for striking;
4060,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"So by blowing, scraping, tuning,"
4061,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,They their instruments were trying.
4062,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4063,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4064,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Margaretta led the Baron
4065,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And his guest now to the garden.
4066,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Women never are in want of
4067,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"A good pretext, when some fun or"
4068,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Some surprise they are preparing.
4069,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,So she praised the shady coolness
4070,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"And the view from the pavilion,"
4071,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Till the two old friends were turning
4072,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Toward that spot without suspicion.
4073,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Like a volley then resounded
4074,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"At their entrance a loud flourish,"
4075,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Every instrument saluting;
4076,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And like roaring torrents bursting
4077,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Wildly through the gaping sluice-gate,"
4078,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,So the overture let loose now
4079,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Its loud storming floods of music
4080,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,On the much astonished hearers.
4081,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,With the greatest skill young Werner
4082,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Led the orchestra, whose chorus"
4083,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Gladly yielded to his bâton.
4084,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Ha! that was a splendid bowing,"
4085,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Such a fiddling, such a pealing!"
4086,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Hopping lightly, like a locust,"
4087,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Through the din the clarinet flew,"
4088,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"And the contra-bass kept groaning,"
4089,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"As if wailing for its soul,"
4090,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,While the player's brow was sweating
4091,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,From his arduous performance.
4092,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4093,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4094,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,There behind in the orchestra
4095,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Fludribus the drum was beating;
4096,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"As a many-sided genius,"
4097,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"During pauses, he was also"
4098,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,To the triangle attending.
4099,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,But his heart o'erflowed with sadness;
4100,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And the drum's dull sound re-echoed
4101,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"His complaints, as dull and grumbling:"
4102,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"""Dilettanti, happy people!"
4103,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Merrily they suck the honey

4105,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Throes the Master's mind created;
4106,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And they spice well their enjoyment
4107,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,With their mutual frequent blunders.
4108,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Genuine Art is a titanic
4109,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Heaven-storming strife and struggle
4110,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"For a Beauty still receding,"

4113,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"But these bunglers are quite happy."""
4114,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4115,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4116,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Now the din of sound subsided.

4119,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Mildly shineth forth the rainbow
4120,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,'Gainst the canopy of heaven;
4121,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,So now the full band is followed
4122,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,By the trumpet's dulcet solo.
4123,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Werner blew it: low and melting
4124,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Rang the tunes forth from the trumpet.
4125,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Full of wonder some were staring

4139,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Now the prelate of St. Blasien
4140,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Stepped forth bowing quite politely
4141,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"To the band, and as a clever"
4142,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Connoisseur and statesman spoke thus:
4143,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"""Heavy wounds have been inflicted"
4144,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"On our land while war was raging,"
4145,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And throughout our German country
4146,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Rudeness was predominating.
4147,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Therefore it deserves great praise, thus"
4148,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,With the Muses to take refuge.
4149,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"This refreshes and ennobles,"
4150,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Civilises human beings,"
4151,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,So that war and strife are silenced.
4152,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,All these frescoes on the walls here
4153,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Show no ordinary talent;
4154,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And still more this feast of music
4155,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Makes me think well of the players
4156,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Who my ears have thus delighted,"
4157,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Brought my happy youth before me,"

4188,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,When our goddesses must wear more
4189,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Draperies than you have painted;

4206,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,'Tis most likely that the pressure
4207,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,Of the hand was full of meaning;

4212,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,
4213,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,"Glasses rang and foaming bumpers,"
4214,THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION.,And there was some heavy drinking;

4267,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Whom the Abbot had distinguished
4268,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Most that evening by his praises;

4276,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,But with thoughts above such nonsense
4277,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Margaretta took an early
4278,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Solitary walk next morning

4284,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,But what saw she? In the arbour

4286,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,She beheld the very trumpet.
4287,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Like the magic horn of Huon,"
4288,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Wondrous mysteries containing;

4298,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Easily a worm might crawl in,"
4299,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Or a thief might come and steal it.
4300,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Shall I take it to the castle,"
4301,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Take it in my careful keeping?
4302,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"No, I'll go, do nothing with it,"
4303,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Should indeed have gone before."""
4304,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4305,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4306,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"But she tarried, for her eyes were"
4307,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Held in durance by the trumpet,"
4308,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Like a shad caught by the fish-hook.
4309,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"""Oh, I wonder,"" she was thinking,"
4310,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"""Whether my breath would be able"
4311,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,From its depths a tone to waken.
4312,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Oh I much should like to know this!
4313,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"No one sees what I am doing,"
4314,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,All around no living being.
4315,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Only my old Hiddigeigei
4316,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Licks the dew from off the box-tree;
4317,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Only insects in the sand here
4318,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Follow out their digging instinct,"
4319,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And the caterpillars gently
4320,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Up and down the arbour crawl."""
4321,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4322,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4323,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"So the maiden shyly entered,"
4324,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Shyly she took up the trumpet,"
4325,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,To her rosy lips she pressed it;
4326,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,But with fright she well-nigh trembled
4327,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,At her breath to sound transforming
4328,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In the trumpet's golden calyx.
4329,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Which the air was bearing farther,"
4330,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Farther--ah, who knoweth where?"
4331,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"But she cannot stop the fun now,"
4332,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"And with sounds discordant, horrid,"
4333,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Fit to rend the ears to pieces,"
4334,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"So disturbed the morning stillness,"
4335,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,That the poor cat Hiddigeigei's
4336,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Long black hair stood up like bristles,"
4337,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Like the sharp quills of a hedgehog.
4338,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Raising then his paw to cover
4339,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"His offended ear, he spoke thus:"
4340,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"""Suffer on, my valiant cat-heart,"
4341,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Which so much has borne already,"
4342,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Also bear this maiden's music!
4343,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"We, we understand the laws well,"
4344,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Which do regulate and govern
4345,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Sound, enigma of creation."
4346,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And we know the charm mysterious
4347,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Which invisibly through space floats,"
4348,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"And, intangible a phantom,"
4349,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Penetrates our hearing organs,"
4350,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And in beasts' as well as men's hearts
4351,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Wakes up love, delight and longing,"
4352,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Raving madness and wild frenzy.
4353,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"And yet, we must bear this insult,"
4354,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,That when nightly in sweet mewing
4355,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"We our love-pangs are outpouring,"
4356,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Men will only laugh and mock us,"
4357,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And our finest compositions
4358,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Rudely brand as caterwauling.
4359,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And in spite of this we witness
4360,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,That these same fault-finding beings
4361,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Can produce such horrid sounds as
4362,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Those which I have just now heard.
4363,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Are such tones not like a nosegay
4364,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Made of straw, and thorns, and nettles,"
4365,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In the midst a prickly thistle?
4366,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And in presence of this maiden
4367,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Who the trumpet there is blowing,"
4368,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Can a man then without blushing
4369,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,E'er sneer at our caterwauling?
4370,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"But, thou valiant heart, be patient!"
4371,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Suffer now, the time will yet come"
4372,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"When this self-sufficient monster,"
4373,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Man, will steal from us the true art"
4374,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Of expressing all his feelings;
4375,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,When the whole world in its struggle
4376,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,For the highest form of culture
4377,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Will adopt our style of music.
4378,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"For in history, there is justice."
4379,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"She redresses every wrong."""
4380,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4381,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4382,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"But besides old Hiddigeigei,"
4383,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Standing far down by the river
4384,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,There was still another listener
4385,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"To these first attempts at blowing,"
4386,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Who felt anger more than pleasure.
4387,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4388,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,It was Werner. He came early
4389,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"With his trumpet to the garden,"
4390,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Wanted to compose a song there
4391,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In that quiet morning-hour.
4392,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"First, however, his dear trumpet"
4393,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,He laid on the rustic table.
4394,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Then stood musing by the stone-wall
4395,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Gazing at the rapid river.
4396,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"""Yes, I see, your waves preserve still"
4397,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Their old course and disposition,"
4398,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Ever toward the ocean rushing,"
4399,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,As my heart for my love striveth.
4400,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Who now from the goal is farthest,"
4401,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Clear green river, thou or I?"""
4402,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,All this train of thought was broken
4403,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"By the stork from the old tower,"
4404,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Who, full of a father's pride, had"
4405,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Taken his young brood to ramble
4406,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,On the Rhine-shore for the first time.
4407,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,'Twas amusing to young Werner
4408,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"How just then the old stork gravely,"
4409,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"On the sand with stealthy cunning,"
4410,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Closely a poor eel was watching,"
4411,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Who of various worms was making
4412,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,There a comfortable meal.
4413,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"He, however, who was wielding"
4414,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"O'er the little worms the strand-law,"
4415,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Soon himself will serve as breakfast.
4416,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"For the greater eats the lesser,"
4417,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And the greatest eats the great ones.
4418,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In this simple manner nature
4419,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Solves the knotty social question.
4420,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"No more did his smoothness help him,"
4421,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"No more his sleek body's wriggling,"
4422,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,No more his spasmodic beating
4423,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,With his tail so strong and supple.
4424,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Tightly held in the indented
4425,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Beak of the determined parent,"
4426,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,He was given to the hopeful
4427,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Stork-brood, now to be divided;"
4428,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And they held with noisy clatter
4429,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Solemnly their morning-feast.
4430,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Nearer to observe this, Werner"
4431,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Had descended to the Rhine-bank,"
4432,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And he seemed in no great hurry
4433,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,To commence his composition.
4434,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,There he sat himself down gently
4435,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,On the insect-covered moss-bank.
4436,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Shaded by a silvery willow,"
4437,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And it gave him much amusement
4438,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Thus to be a silent witness
4439,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Of this banquet of the storks.
4440,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4441,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4442,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Pleasures, yet, of all descriptions"
4443,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Are but fleeting on our planet.
4444,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Even to the most contented
4445,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Doth it happen that fate often
4446,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Like a meteor bursts upon them.
4447,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Only a short time had Werner
4448,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Viewed this scene when he was startled
4449,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"By the tones of his own trumpet,"
4450,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Which like keen-edged Pandour daggers
4451,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Deep into his soul were cutting.
4452,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4453,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4454,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"""'Tis the gardener's saucy youngster"
4455,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Who my trumpet thus is blowing,"""
4456,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Said young Werner, in his anger"
4457,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Starting from his seat so quickly
4458,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"That the storks thereby much frightened,"
4459,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Fluttering upward sought the tower;
4460,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And so quickly that they even
4461,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Had no time to take the eel off.
4462,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Like a poor old torso lay he
4463,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,On the sand so pitifully;
4464,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And the chronicles are silent
4465,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Whether the old father stork came
4466,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Ever back to take his booty.
4467,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4468,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4469,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Werner meanwhile to the garden
4470,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Climbed up; to the shady arbour
4471,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"On the soft green sward he's walking,"
4472,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,That the pebbly footpath may not
4473,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,By the noise betray his coming.
4474,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In the very act of sinning
4475,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Doth he wish to catch the rascal,"
4476,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And to beat time to his music
4477,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,On his back without relenting.
4478,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Thus he comes up to the arbour,"
4479,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,With his hand raised high in anger.
4480,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"But, as if 'twere struck by lightning,"
4481,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"To his side it dropped down quickly,"
4482,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"And the stroke remained, like German"
4483,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Unity and other projects,"
4484,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Only an ideal dream.
4485,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Then beheld he Margaretta
4486,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Pressing to her lips the trumpet,"
4487,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And her rosy cheeks are puffed out
4488,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Like those trumpet-blowing angels'
4489,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In the church of Fridolinus.
4490,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Up she starts now as a thief would
4491,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"In the neighbour's yard detected,"
4492,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And the trumpet drops abruptly
4493,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,From the touch of her soft lips.
4494,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Werner covered her confusion
4495,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Through a clever maze of language;
4496,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And with ardour he commences
4497,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,On the spot to teach the maiden
4498,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,The first steps in trumpet-blowing
4499,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"In strict order, with due method;"
4500,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Shows the instrument's construction,"
4501,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"How to use the lips in blowing,"
4502,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,That true tones may be forthcoming.
4503,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Margaretta listened docile.
4504,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"And before she is aware, new"
4505,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Tones she finds she is awaking
4506,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,From the trumpet which young Werner
4507,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,With low bows had handed to her.
4508,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Easily from him she learneth
4509,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,What her father's cuirassiers blew
4510,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,As the call to charge in battle;
4511,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Only a few notes and simple,"
4512,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,But most pithy and inspiring.
4513,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4514,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4515,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Love is, there can be no question,"
4516,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Of all teachers the most skilful;
4517,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And what years of earnest study
4518,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Do not conquer, he is winning"
4519,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"With the charm of an entreaty,"
4520,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,With the magic of a look.
4521,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,E'en a common Flemish blacksmith
4522,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Once became through love's sweet passion
4523,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In advanced age a great painter.
4524,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Happy teacher, happy scholar,"
4525,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,In the honeysuckle arbour!
4526,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,'Twas as if the only safety
4527,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Of the German empire rested
4528,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,On this trumpet-call's performance.
4529,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,But within their souls was stirring
4530,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Quite a different melody:
4531,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"That sweet song, old as creation,"
4532,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Of the bliss of youthful lovers;
4533,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"True, a song without the words yet,"
4534,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"But they had divined its meaning,"
4535,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,And beneath a playful manner
4536,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Hid the blissful consciousness,"
4537,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Startled by this trumpet-blowing
4538,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Came the Baron reconnoitring,"
4539,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Tried to frown, but soon his anger"
4540,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Was converted into pleasure,"
4541,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,When he heard his child there blowing
4542,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,The old fanfar of his horsemen.
4543,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Friendly spoke he to young Werner:
4544,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"""You are truly in your office"
4545,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,A most ardent zeal unfolding.
4546,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"If you go on in this manner,"
4547,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,We shall see most wondrous things yet.
4548,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,The old stable-door which harshly
4549,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Creaks and groans upon its hinges,"
4550,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Even in the pond the bull-frogs
4551,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"May perhaps change for the better,"
4552,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Through your trumpet's magic charm."""
4553,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4554,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,
4555,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Werner held, however, henceforth"
4556,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"His dear trumpet as a jewel,"
4557,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"Which the richest Basel merchant,"
4558,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,"With the fullest bag of money,"
4559,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Could not ever purchase from him;
4560,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,For the lips of Margaretta
4561,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,Made it sacred by their touch.
4562,TEACHING AND LEARNING.,

4578,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Who to-day behaved quite badly:
4579,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Showing his sharp teeth and grinning,"
4580,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Tore a branch off from the fir-tree,"

4582,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Clambered often quite indignant
4583,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Up and down just like a squirrel;
4584,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,From the wings of a poor night-owl
4585,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Roughly plucked out several feathers;
4586,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And while mocking the old fir-tree
4587,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Rocked himself upon its summit.

4599,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Deep into thy flesh, till falling;"

4666,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Into butterflies develop.
4667,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Homeward now he would be turning;
4668,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,But the wood-sprite Meysenhartus
4669,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Hid with dust the right path from him,"
4670,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"And young Werner, absent-minded,"
4671,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,'Stead of river-ward went inland.
4672,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Now again the wood-sprite grinning
4673,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Clambered to the fir-tree's summit,"
4674,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Rocking gaily in the branches.
4675,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"""He is caught!"" so said he, mocking."
4676,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Werner paying no attention,"
4677,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Went up through the Hasel valley,"
4678,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Till he came to a steep mountain,"
4679,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,To a corner cool and shady.
4680,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Holly, sloe, and climbing ivy"
4681,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Grew around the rocks luxuriant,"
4682,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,While near by a clear spring rippled.
4683,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,
4684,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,
4685,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Through the bushes stepped young Werner
4686,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,To refresh himself by drinking.
4687,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Strongly tangled was the brushwood,"
4688,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And upon it he trod firmly.

4690,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Wailing tones, as from a mole which"
4691,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,At his subterranean labour
4692,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Caught in traps and now detected,"
4693,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Roughly is jerked up to daylight.
4694,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,From the grass rose something crackling;
4695,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Lo, there stood a gray-clad pygmy,"
4696,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Hardly three feet high, and hunchbacked;"
4697,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"But his face was clear and gentle,"
4698,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And his odd small eyes looked clever.
4699,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Gracefully he let the long ends
4700,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Of his garment on the ground trail,"
4701,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"And said, limping: ""Sir, you have been"

4718,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Thinking that you rule creation,"
4719,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,But entirely ignoring
4720,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"All those spirits which, though silent,"

4746,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,
4747,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Then the dwarf said: ""This sounds better."

4804,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Soon, however, widely opened"
4805,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,At the passage end a cavern
4806,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Of gigantic height and grandeur.

4808,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Lofty arches of the ceiling;
4809,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,From the walls the gray stalactites
4810,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Hung in various patterns twining,"
4811,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Marvellous, yet graceful textures;"
4812,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Some like tears which from the walls dropped,"
4813,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Others like the richly twisted
4814,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Branches of gigantic corals.
4815,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,An unearthly bluish colour
4816,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"All throughout the space was glowing,"
4817,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Mingled with the glaring torch-light
4818,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,From the sharp-edged stones reflected.
4819,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,From the depths a rushing sound rose
4820,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,As from distant mountain-streams.
4821,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Werner gazed at all this splendour,"

4823,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"To some strange and lofty temple,"
4824,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And his heart was filled with awe.

4853,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Ever farther, Werner saw how"
4854,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Huge chaotic rocky masses

4860,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"It looked home-like, a large square-room,"
4861,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Of high rocky walls constructed,"
4862,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Fitted for a hermitage;
4863,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Round about stood slender columns.
4864,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Ever dropping from the ceiling
4865,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And through centuries increasing
4866,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Had stalactites slowly formed them;
4867,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And some others stood half finished
4868,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,In the process of formation.
4869,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Now the gnome knocked on the columns,"
4870,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And mysterious solemn tones rang

4872,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"""They are tuned,"" he said, ""according"

4877,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Smooth and round, just like a table;"

4885,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Petrified they now were hanging
4886,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,In his beard and from his robes.

4899,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,But he shook his head and broke out
4900,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,In a mocking scornful laughter.
4901,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Marvellously grand his words were,"
4902,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Now like prayers devout and pious,"
4903,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Like a psalm, such as we gnomes sing"
4904,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Often in the earth's vast bowels;

4906,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Much I could not understand.
4907,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,But it woke the recollections
4908,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Of the days of time primeval,"
4909,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,When the wild ferocious Titans
4910,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Rocks and mountains tore up o'er us
4911,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"From their firm and deep foundations,"
4912,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And we fled to greater depths.
4913,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"For the man I felt great pity,"
4914,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And I took him to my cavern;
4915,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"And he liked it, when I showed him"
4916,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,All the gnomes' incessant labours;
4917,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And directly felt at home here.
4918,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Oft together have we listened
4919,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"To the growing of stalactites,"
4920,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Chatted also many evenings
4921,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Of the things below us hidden;
4922,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Only when my conversation
4923,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Turned to men, he grew quite angry;"
4924,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Dark his frowns were, and he broke once"
4925,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Seven columns in his fury.
4926,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,When I wished to praise the sunlight
4927,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"And the skies, he stopped me, saying:"

4935,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"So he stayed here in the cavern,"
4936,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And the grief which overwhelmed him
4937,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Was dissolved in tender sadness.
4938,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Oft I saw him gently weeping;
4939,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Oft, when a melodious wailing"
4940,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Through the columns' hollow shafts rang,"
4941,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"He sat there, his sweet songs singing."
4942,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,But he gradually grew silent.
4943,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Did I ask him what he wanted,"
4944,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Then he smiling took my hand:
4945,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"'Gnome, I many songs can sing thee,"
4946,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,But the best I have not sung yet.
4947,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Will you know its name? 'Tis silence.
4948,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Silence--silence! oh how well one

4950,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Depth creates true modesty.

4980,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Then in thinking of his own love,"
4981,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Through the sadness now there mingled
4982,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Strains of joy--first faint and distant,"
4983,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Then came nearer--fresher, fuller,"
4984,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,And the last notes sounded like a

4986,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"And the silent man then listened,"
4987,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,Nodded gently with his head.

4998,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"Underneath a shrine was hidden,"
4999,YOUNG WERNER IN THE GNOME'S CAVE.,"And within were sparkling jewels,"

5289,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Never to defraud the orphan,"
5290,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Ne'er to mix sand with our spices."""
5291,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Even one proposed this motion:
5292,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Let us send out to these peasants"
5293,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Meat and wine in great abundance,"
5294,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Also of doubloons some dozens,"
5295,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,That from hence they may depart;
5296,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"They in Waldshut may look out then,"
5297,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"How they drive away these fellows."""
5298,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5299,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5300,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Now the Baron came among them:
5301,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""My good sirs! I do believe you"
5302,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Hang your heads. To work now bravely!
5303,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"When the Swedes the town beleagured,"
5304,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Then 'twas grave, but this is only"
5305,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Child's play. Surely you have always
5306,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Liked to hear and make good music;
5307,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,So the booming guns will please you.
5308,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Let the orchestra strike up now!
5309,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"And these fellows, when they hear you,"
5310,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Homeward soon will all go dancing,"
5311,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,E'er the emperor's own detachment
5312,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Plays for them the grand finale."""
5313,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5314,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5315,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Thus he spoke. In times of terror
5316,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Oft a brave word at the right time
5317,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Can work wonders; many cowards
5318,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,From example drink in courage;
5319,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And one single iron will leads
5320,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Oft along the wavering masses.
5321,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Thus the council looked up strengthened
5322,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,To the Baron's gray moustaches.
5323,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Yes, this is just our opinion,"
5324,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"We'll defend our city bravely,"
5325,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And the Baron shall command us;
5326,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,For he knows well how to do it.
5327,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Death to all these cursed peasants!"""
5328,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Through the streets th' alarm is sounded
5329,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"To the town-gate, where a narrow"
5330,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Dam leads on to terra firma,"
5331,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Ran well armed the younger people.
5332,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,On the bastion stood commanding
5333,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Fludribus, the fresco-painter,"
5334,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Who had there assembled round him
5335,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Some young lads who with great effort
5336,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,An old gun were hauling up there.
5337,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Smiling looked at them the Baron,"
5338,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,But great Fludribus said gravely:
5339,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Devotees of art can boast of"
5340,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Stores of universal knowledge.
5341,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Let them have a chance, and they will"
5342,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Rule the state as well as armies.
5343,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,My keen eye sees well there's danger
5344,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,In this spot; and as Cellini
5345,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,From the Castle of St Angelo
5346,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Shot the constable of France once.
5347,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,So--alas at foes inferior--
5348,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Cannonades here Fludribus."""
5349,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5350,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5351,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Only do not kill them all off!"""
5352,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Said the Baron; ""and be sure first"
5353,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,To get balls enough and powder;
5354,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"For, the gun you there are dragging"
5355,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Will not be of use without them!"""
5356,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5357,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5358,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,To the Rhine-bank came the peasants
5359,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"In great crowds, and looked up growling"
5360,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,At the high walls of the city
5361,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And the well-closed city-gate.
5362,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""In his den the fox is hiding,"
5363,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"He has barred his hole most firmly,"
5364,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"But the peasants will unearth him,"""
5365,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Fridli said, of Bergalingen."
5366,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Forward! I will be your leader!"""
5367,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Drums were beating the assault now,"
5368,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Heavy muskets cracking loudly;
5369,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Through the powder-smoke ran shouting
5370,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,All these hordes against the town-gate.
5371,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,On the walls to best advantage
5372,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Had the Baron placed his forces;
5373,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And was tranquilly then looking
5374,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,At the crowd of wild assaulters.
5375,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""'Tis to be regretted,"" thought he,"
5376,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""That such strength is idly wasted."
5377,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Out of these strong country lubbers
5378,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"One might form a splendid regiment."""
5379,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"His command is heard: ""Now fire!"""
5380,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,The assaulters then were welcomed
5381,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"With a well-aimed thundering volley,"
5382,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And they fled in all directions;
5383,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Like a swarm of crows dispersing,"
5384,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,When the hail-shot flies among them.
5385,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5386,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5387,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And not few of them had fallen.
5388,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,'Neath an apple-tree was lying
5389,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,By the shore one who spoke feebly
5390,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,To a comrade passing by him:
5391,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Greet from me my poor old mother,"
5392,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Also my Verena Frommherz.
5393,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Say, she can with a good conscience"
5394,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Marry the tall Uickerhans now.
5395,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"For, poor Seppli here is staining"
5396,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"The white sand with his true heart's blood!"""
5397,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5398,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5399,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Whilst this happened by the town-gate,"
5400,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Some were trying if the city
5401,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Could be entered by a back-way.
5402,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,On the Rhine below were lying
5403,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Fishing-boats beside a cabin,"
5404,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Where in traps they caught the salmon.
5405,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,There another crowd streamed onward.
5406,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,An audacious lad from Karsau
5407,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Led them; for, he knew each byway"
5408,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Near the river, and had often"
5409,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Many fish at night-time stolen
5410,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,From the nets of other people.
5411,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"In three fishing-boats, well manned, thence"
5412,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Were they rowing up the river.
5413,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Willow-trees and heavy brushwood,"
5414,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And a bend there in the river
5415,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Saved them from discovery.
5416,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Where the garden of the castle
5417,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,On arched walls is far projecting
5418,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"O'er the Rhine, they stopped their barges,"
5419,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And quite easy was the landing.
5420,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5421,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5422,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,On the roof of the pavilion
5423,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Which once Fludribus had painted
5424,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Sat the black cat Hiddigeigei.
5425,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,With surprise the worthy cat saw
5426,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Spear-heads far below him glistening;
5427,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Saw a man, too, upward climbing"
5428,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"On the stone wall, tightly holding"
5429,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,With his teeth a shining sabre;
5430,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And how others followed after.
5431,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Growling said then Hiddigeigei:
5432,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Best for a wise cat it would be"
5433,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Ever to remain quite neutral
5434,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,To man's foolish acts of daring;
5435,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"But I hate these boorish peasants,"
5436,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Hate the smell of cows and stables.
5437,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"If they triumph, woe to Europe;"
5438,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"For, it would destroy completely"
5439,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,The fine atmosphere of culture.
5440,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Now look out below, you fellows!"
5441,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Since the geese by cries of warning
5442,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Saved the Capitol of Rome once,"
5443,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Animals are taking interest
5444,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"In the history of the world."""
5445,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5446,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5447,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Up he sprang in furious anger,"
5448,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Curved his back, his hair all bristling,"
5449,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And commenced a caterwauling
5450,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Fit to take away one's hearing.
5451,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5452,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5453,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,On the jutting turret standing.
5454,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Faithful Anton heard this wauling,"
5455,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And involuntarily looking
5456,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Toward that way: ""Good heaven!"" said he,"
5457,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""In the garden is the enemy."""
5458,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Quick his signal-shot brought other
5459,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Men-at-arms, along with Werner,"
5460,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Who placed quickly his few fighters:
5461,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Stand thou here--thou there--don't hurry"
5462,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"With your fire!"" His heart beat wildly:"
5463,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Ha, my sword, maintain thy valour!"""
5464,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Shallow was the castle's moat then,"
5465,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Well-nigh dry, and 'mid the rushes"
5466,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Glisten many swords and spear-heads.
5467,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Daring men are climbing upward
5468,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,O'er the tower's crumbling stone-work.
5469,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Muskets cracking, arrows flying."
5470,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Axe-strokes 'gainst the gate are ringing,"
5471,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Everywhere attack, and shouting:"
5472,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Castle thou wilt soon be taken!"""
5473,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"And between, the fall of bodies"
5474,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,In the moat is heard--much blood flows.
5475,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,By the gate cries out young Werner:
5476,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Well done, Anton! Now take aim at"
5477,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,That dark fellow on thy left hand;
5478,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,I'll attend unto the other.
5479,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Steady now! They are retreating!"""
5480,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5481,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5482,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Thus the first attack proved fruitless,"
5483,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And with bloody heads drew back now
5484,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"The assaulters, seeking shelter,"
5485,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,'Midst the chestnut-trees' dense thicket.
5486,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Scornful words now reach the castle:
5487,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Coward knights, faint-hearted servants,"
5488,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Keep behind the walls, protected."
5489,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Just come out to honest combat
5490,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"If you've courage."" ""Death and Devil!"""
5491,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Werner shouted. ""Let the bridge down!"
5492,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Spears at rest! Now onward!--Mock us?
5493,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"In the Rhine with these damned scoundrels!"""
5494,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5495,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5496,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Down the bridge fell rattling loudly;
5497,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Far ahead went Werner rushing,"
5498,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Right into the crowd; ran over
5499,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Just the fellow who did guide them.
5500,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""When the sword gets dull, thou rascal,"
5501,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"With my fist alone I'll kill thee."""
5502,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,In the crowd he sees a sturdy
5503,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Soldier, with a weather-beaten"
5504,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Face, bold and defiant-looking."
5505,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"He had served with Wallenstein once,"
5506,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And now fought for these mean peasants
5507,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,From mere love of strife and bloodshed.
5508,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""Taste my steel now, gray old warrior,"""
5509,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Cried young Werner, as his sword swung"
5510,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Whizzing through the air to strike him.
5511,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,But the soldier's halberd parried
5512,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Werner's stroke: ""Not badly done, lad!"
5513,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Here my answer!"" Blood was dripping"
5514,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,From young Werner's locks; his forehead
5515,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Showed a deep wound from the halberd.
5516,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"But the one who swung it, never"
5517,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Gave a second stroke; his own throat,"
5518,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Where by armour not protected,"
5519,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Being cut by Werner's weapon.
5520,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Three steps backward then he staggered
5521,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Sinking: ""Devil, stir thy fire!"
5522,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Hast me now!"" Dead lay the soldier."
5523,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5524,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5525,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Werner, thy young life guard well now!"
5526,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Raging were the peasants, thronging"
5527,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,In great crowds around this handful.
5528,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,'Gainst a chestnut-tree now leaning
5529,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Weak, but still his life defending,"
5530,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Stood young Werner; round him rallied,"
5531,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Brave and faithful, all the servants."
5532,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Save him, God! The wound is bleeding,"
5533,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"From his hand the sword falls slowly,"
5534,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Dimmed his eyes are, and the enemy"
5535,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,At his gory breast is aiming.
5536,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Then--all may go well yet--
5537,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"From the castle rings distinctly,"
5538,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"As if for a charge, the trumpet;"
5539,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Then a shot--one falls; a volley
5540,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Follows. ""Onward!"" so the Baron"
5541,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Now commands, and wildly flying"
5542,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Tear the peasants to the Rhine.
5543,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Cheer up, Werner, friends are coming,"
5544,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And with them comes Margaretta!
5545,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"When the fight below was raging,"
5546,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"To the terrace she ascended,"
5547,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And she blew--herself not knowing
5548,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Why she did it--in the anguish
5549,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Of her soul, the battle signal"
5550,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Used in the Imperial army.
5551,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Which she'd learned in happy moments
5552,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,In the honeysuckle-arbour.
5553,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,It was heard by those returning
5554,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,With the Baron from the town-gate;
5555,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,And the maiden's war-cry made them
5556,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Hurry quickly to the rescue
5557,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Of those fighting in the garden.
5558,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"Woman's heart, so gentle, timid,"
5559,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,What gave thee such courage then?

5561,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,
5562,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"""God, he lives!"" she bent now softly"
5563,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Over him who 'neath the chestnuts

5566,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,"From his brow: ""Hast fought right bravely!"""
5567,THE HAUENSTEIN RIOT.,Half unconscious gazed young Werner;

5641,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In this ground so rich and fertile,"
5642,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Which it permeates completely
5643,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,With its thousand fibrous rootlets.
5644,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5645,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5646,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Thrice already Margaretta
5647,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"To the door her way had wended,"
5648,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,But as many times returning
5649,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,She at last approached the bedside.
5650,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On the table stood a cooling
5651,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Potion, medicines in bottles;"
5652,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,But she neither touched the cooling
5653,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Potion nor the other bottles.
5654,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Timidly she bent there o'er him,"
5655,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Timidly and hardly breathing,"
5656,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Lest her breath might wake the sleeper.
5657,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Long she gazed at his closed eyelids
5658,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And involuntarily stooping,"
5659,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,With her lips--But who interprets
5660,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,All the strange mysterious actions
5661,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Of a first sweet loving passion?
5662,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Well-nigh can my song conjecture
5663,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,That she really wished to kiss him;
5664,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"But she did not; startled sighing,"
5665,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Turned abruptly--like a timid
5666,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Fawn she hurried from the chamber.
5667,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5668,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5669,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Like a man who, long accustomed"
5670,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"To the gloom and damp of dungeons,"
5671,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Seems bewildered when beholding,"
5672,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,For the first time free fair Nature:
5673,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Hast thou not, O sun, grown brighter?"
5674,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Has the sky not deeper colours?"""
5675,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And his eyes are nearly dazzled
5676,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,By the light so long denied him:
5677,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Thus returns the convalescent
5678,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Once again to life and vigour.
5679,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Fresher, warmer, rosier visions"
5680,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Rise before his raptured glances,"
5681,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Which he greets with fond rejoicing.
5682,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""World, how fair thou art!"" was also"
5683,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Dropping from the lips of Werner,"
5684,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,As on the broad steps he slowly
5685,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Now descended to the garden.
5686,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Leaning on his staff, he stood long"
5687,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Quiet, basking in the sunbeams"
5688,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Playing o'er the fragrant flowers,"
5689,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Drew a long breath, and then slowly"
5690,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Stepped upon the garden-terrace.
5691,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On the stone-seat in the sunshine
5692,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"He sat down now. Bees were humming,"
5693,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Butterflies were lightly flying
5694,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"'Mid the verdant chestnut-branches,"
5695,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Out and in, like tavern-goers."
5696,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Green, pellucid, gently rushing,"
5697,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Bore the Rhine its waters onward;
5698,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And a pine-raft filled with people,"
5699,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Snake-like, swiftly sped toward Basel."
5700,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Near the shore, up to his knees stood"
5701,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In the river there a fisher,"
5702,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Singing gently to himself thus:
5703,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5704,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5705,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Peasant comes with spears and muskets,"
5706,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Peasant storms the forest-city,"
5707,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Peasant will now fight with Austria:
5708,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Peasant! you will find that will
5709,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Make much heavier the bill;
5710,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Take your purse and pay the joke!
5711,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Seven florins seemed too much then,"
5712,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,One-and-twenty must thou pay now.
5713,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Soldiers quartered are dear guests too;
5714,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Then the plaisters from the surgeons:
5715,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Peasant! you will find that will
5716,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Make much heavier the bill;
5717,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Take your purse and pay the joke!"""
5718,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5719,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5720,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Gaily gazed young Werner o'er the
5721,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Lovely landscape and the river;
5722,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,But he stopped his contemplations.
5723,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On the wall with sunlight flooded
5724,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"He beheld a shadow gliding,"
5725,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,As of curls and flowing garments--
5726,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Well did Werner know this shadow.
5727,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Through the shrubbery came smiling
5728,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Margaretta; she was watching
5729,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Hiddigeigei's graceful gambols,"
5730,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Who then in the garden-arbour
5731,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,With a wee white mouse was playing.
5732,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,With his velvet paws he held it
5733,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Tight, and like a gracious sovereign"
5734,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Looked down on his trembling captive.
5735,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5736,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5737,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,From his seat rose up young Werner
5738,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Bowing lowly and with reverence.
5739,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Over Margaretta's cheeks spread
5740,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Ever-changing rosy blushes.
5741,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Master Werner, may God bless you,"
5742,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And how are you? You were silent
5743,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Such a long time, so with pleasure"
5744,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Shall I hear your voice once more."""
5745,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5746,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5747,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Since my forehead made acquaintance"
5748,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Lately with the enemy's halberd,"
5749,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Hardly knew I,"" answered Werner,"
5750,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Where my life and thoughts had flown to."
5751,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,O'er me lay thick clouds of darkness;
5752,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,But to-day in dreams an angel
5753,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"To my side descended, saying:"
5754,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Thou art well, arise, be happy"
5755,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,That thou hast thy health recovered
5756,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And it was so. With a firm step
5757,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Thus far have I come already."""
5758,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Now again fair Margaretta's
5759,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Cheeks were like the blush of morning.
5760,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"When the dream young Werner mentioned,"
5761,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Bashfully she turned her head; then
5762,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Playfully she interrupted:
5763,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""I suppose you are now looking"
5764,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,At the battle-field; indeed it
5765,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Proved a hot day, and I fancy"
5766,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Still I hear the roar of battle:
5767,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Do you still recall, you stood there"
5768,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"By yon tree, and there a dead man"
5769,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Lay beneath those blooming elders?
5770,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Where the gossamer so lightly
5771,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Through the air in threads is flying,"
5772,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Spears and halberds then were glittering.
5773,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"There, where still you see the traces"
5774,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Of fresh plaster on the stone-wall,"
5775,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Broke those peasants through when flying.
5776,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And, my good sir, over yonder"
5777,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Then my father loudly scolded,"
5778,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,That a certain person headlong
5779,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Had into such danger plunged."""
5780,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5781,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5782,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Death and--but forgive, my lady."
5783,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"That well-nigh I swore,"" said Werner."
5784,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""They were mocking us; and others,"
5785,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"If they please, may keep their temper."
5786,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"When I hear such stinging speeches,"
5787,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Then my heart burns, my fist clenches:"
5788,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Fight! no other means I know of;
5789,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Fight I must, e'en should the whole world"
5790,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Go to atoms with a crash.
5791,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Through my veins there flows no fish-blood;
5792,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And to-day, though somewhat feeble,"
5793,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In the same case, I should stand there"
5794,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"By the chestnut-tree again."""
5795,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5796,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5797,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Wicked man,"" said Margaretta,"
5798,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""That a fresh stroke from a halberd"
5799,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Should be crossing your old scar, and"
5800,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,That--but do you know who suffered
5801,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Keenly for your daring conduct?
5802,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Do you know whose tears were flowing?
5803,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Would you once more give the order:
5804,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Lower drawbridge! if I begged you:
5805,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Werner stay and do remember
5806,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,The poor suffering Margaretta?

5808,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Further to spin out her sentence.
5809,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"What the mouth spoke not, the eyes said;"
5810,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"What the eyes said not, the heart did."
5811,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Dreamily young Werner lifted
5812,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Unto her his raptured gaze:
5813,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Am I dying, or is doubly"
5814,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"My young life to me now given?"""
5815,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In each other's arms they flew then,"
5816,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Sought each other's lips with ardour,"
5817,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And transported, pressed upon them"
5818,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Love's first kiss, so sweet and blissful."
5819,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Golden-purple streamed the sunlight
5820,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Through the shady trees' high summits,"
5821,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Down upon two happy beings--
5822,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"On young Werner's pallid features,"
5823,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On the lovely blushing maiden.
5824,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5825,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5826,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Love's first kiss so sweet and blissful!
5827,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Thinking of thee, joy and sorrow"
5828,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Both steal o'er me; joy, that also"
5829,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"I have once thy nectar tasted,"
5830,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Sorrow, that but once we taste it!"
5831,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,For thy sake I wished to cull from
5832,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Language, all the fairest flowers,"
5833,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,For a wreath unto thine honour;
5834,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"But, instead of words rose visions"
5835,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Clear before me, and they led me"
5836,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Far to float o'er time and space.
5837,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"First I soared to Eden's garden,"
5838,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,When the new-born world was lying
5839,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In its pristine youthful freshness,"
5840,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,When its age by days was reckoned.
5841,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Evening came, a rosy light spread"
5842,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"O'er the sky, while in the river's"
5843,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Waves the sun to rest sank slowly;
5844,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"On the shore, in merry frolic,"
5845,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Graceful animals were playing.
5846,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Through the shady paths 'neath palm-trees
5847,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,The first human couple walked.
5848,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Wide through space they gazed in silence,"
5849,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,'Mid the holy peace of evening;
5850,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In each other's eyes they looked then,"
5851,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And their lips did meet.
5852,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Then I saw before me rising.
5853,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Visions of quite different aspect;
5854,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Dark the sky, rain-storm and lightning,"
5855,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Mountains bursting, from the dark depths"
5856,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Foaming waters rushing upward.
5857,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Flooded over is the ancient
5858,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Mother Earth, and she is dying."
5859,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"To the cliffs the waves are rolling,"
5860,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"To the old man and his consort,"
5861,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,To the two last living mortals.
5862,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Now a flash--I saw them smiling,"
5863,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Then embracing, without speaking,"
5864,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Ever kissing. Night then--roaring,"
5865,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Did the flood engulf these beings.
5866,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"This I saw, and well I know now,"
5867,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"That a kiss outweighs all language,"
5868,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Is, though mute, love's song of songs."
5869,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And when words fail, then the singer"
5870,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Should be silent; therefore silent
5871,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,He returns now to the garden.
5872,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On the stone steps of the terrace
5873,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Lay the worthy Hiddigeigei;
5874,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And with great amazement saw he,"
5875,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,How his mistress and young Werner
5876,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Were each other fondly kissing.
5877,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Grumbling said he to himself then:
5878,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Often have I meditated"
5879,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"On great problems hard to settle,"
5880,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Which my cat-heart fully fathomed;
5881,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,But there's one which yet remaineth
5882,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Quite unsolved, uncomprehended:"
5883,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Why do people kiss each other?
5884,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Not from hatred, not from hunger,"
5885,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Else they'd bite and eat each other;
5886,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Neither can it be an aimless
5887,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Nonsense, for they are in general"
5888,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Wise, and know well what they're doing."
5889,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Why then is it, I ask vainly,"
5890,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Why do people kiss each other?
5891,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Why do mostly so the youthful?
5892,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And why mostly so in Spring-time?
5893,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Over all these knotty questions,"
5894,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"I intend to ponder further,"
5895,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"On the gable-roof to-morrow."""
5896,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5897,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5898,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Margaretta plucked some roses,"
5899,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Took then Werner's hat, and gaily"
5900,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,With the fairest ones adorned it.
5901,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Poor pale man, till there are blooming"
5902,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"On your own cheeks just such roses,"
5903,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On your hat you'll have to wear them.
5904,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"But now tell me, wherefore is it"
5905,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,That I do so dearly love you?
5906,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Not a word you ere have spoken,"
5907,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,That could show me that you loved me.
5908,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Sometimes only shy and bashful
5909,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Did you raise at me your glances,"
5910,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And sometimes you played before me.
5911,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Is it, then, your country's custom,"
5912,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"That a woman's love is won there,"
5913,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Without words by trumpet-blowing?"""
5914,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5915,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5916,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Margaretta, sweetest darling,"""
5917,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Said young Werner, ""could I venture?"
5918,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"You appeared to me so saint-like,"
5919,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In your flowing, snow-white garments."
5920,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,At the feast of Fridolinus.
5921,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,'Twas your glance which made me enter
5922,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,In your noble father's service;
5923,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And your favour was the sunshine
5924,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Which my daily life illumined.
5925,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Ah! there by the mountain-lake once,"
5926,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,On my head was placed a garland.
5927,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"'Twas love's crown of thorns you gave me,"
5928,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And in silence I have worn it.
5929,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Could I speak, O could the homeless"
5930,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Trumpeter his yearnings utter
5931,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Boldly to fair Margaretta?
5932,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Unto you as to an angel,"
5933,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Who is guarding us poor mortals
5934,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Did I look in silent worship,"
5935,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,And I wished in your dear service
5936,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Here to die beneath the chestnuts.
5937,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"From that fate you have preserved me,"
5938,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Unto life and health restored me,"
5939,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Made my life now doubly precious,"
5940,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,As I know your love adorns it.
5941,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Take me then! Since you did give me
5942,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"That first burning kiss, I only"
5943,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Live through you, belong to you now,"
5944,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Margaretta--ever thine!"""
5945,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5946,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,
5947,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""Thine, yes, thine,"" said Margaretta;"
5948,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"""What stiff barriers are erected"
5949,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,By our words! Belong to you now--
5950,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,What a solemn cold expression.

5952,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"No more you; _thou_, heart to heart pressed,"
5953,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Lips to lips, that is his language;"
5954,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Therefore, Werner, let another"

5956,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"In the sky the moon first shineth,"
5957,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Then by countless stars is followed;
5958,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"So the first kiss, when once given,"
5959,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Is by hosts of others followed.
5960,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,But how many were by stealth robbed
5961,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"And paid duly back with interest,"
5962,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,All this doth my song keep secret.
5963,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Poetry and dry statistics
5964,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,"Are, alas, not on good terms."
5965,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Also Anton came now hurrying
5966,YOUNG WERNER AND MARGARETTA.,Through the garden with a message:

5990,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Of his former life, and nowhere"
5991,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Can his eyes abide with pleasure;
5992,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Only gloomy spectres rise up,"
5993,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Which the sunlight soon would banish.
5994,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Unrefreshed, next to the future"
5995,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Roves the mind from which sweet sleep flies;
5996,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Forges plans, takes resolutions,"
5997,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Builds up proud and airy castles;
5998,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,But like owls and bats are flying
5999,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,All around them hosts of doubts which
6000,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Drive away all hope and courage.
6001,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6002,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6003,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,From the tower-clock struck midnight.
6004,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,On his couch was lying sleepless
6005,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Werner in the turret-chamber;
6006,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Through the window beaming faintly
6007,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Fell a narrow ray of moonlight,"
6008,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,While beneath the Rhine did rush.
6009,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And the sleepless brain of Werner
6010,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Is by dream-like visions haunted.
6011,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Once it seemed to him like Sunday;
6012,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Bells are pealing, horses neighing,"
6013,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Toward the Schwarzwald goes a wedding,"
6014,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"He walks at the head as bridegroom,"
6015,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,By his side is Margaretta;
6016,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And she wears a wreath of myrtle.
6017,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"In the village loud rejoicings,"
6018,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And the roads and village street are
6019,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,All with flowers overstrewn.
6020,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In his priestly robes is standing
6021,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,By the church-door the old Pastor
6022,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Blessing, beckoning him to enter--"
6023,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,But the vision's thread broke off here
6024,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,For a new one: He imagined
6025,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,At the door there was a knocking;
6026,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And now enters the odd figure
6027,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Of his dear old friend Perkéo,"
6028,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With his red nose shining brightly
6029,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In the dimly-lighted chamber;
6030,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And he speaks with husky voice thus:
6031,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Oh, my lad, with love don't meddle!"
6032,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Love's a fire which consumeth
6033,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Him who kindles it, completely;"
6034,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And thou art no charcoal-burner!
6035,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Come then home to the clear Neckar,"
6036,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Come with me to my old wine-tun,"
6037,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Which contains good stuff sufficient
6038,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"All thy love-flames to put out."""
6039,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6040,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6041,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Next he seems to be transported
6042,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,To an Eastern field of battle.
6043,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Cries of Allah, sabres whirring;"
6044,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And he soon strikes down a Pashaw
6045,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"From his horse, and brings the crescent"
6046,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"To the general, Prince Eugene,"
6047,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Who then claps him on the shoulder:
6048,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Well done, my Imperial captain!"""
6049,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,From the battle-field his dreaming
6050,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Flies back to the days of childhood,"
6051,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And his nurse sings in the garden:
6052,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Squirrel climbs up on the blackthorn,"
6053,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Squirrel goes up to the tree-top,"
6054,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Squirrel falls into his grave.
6055,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Had he not so high ascended,"
6056,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Then his fall had been less heavy,"
6057,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Had not broken then his leg."""
6058,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6059,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6060,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Thus disturbed by all this dreaming,"
6061,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Werner sprang up of a sudden,"
6062,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With long strides walked through his chamber;
6063,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And his mind was troubled always
6064,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,By the same portentous question:
6065,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Shall I ask the Baron for her?"""
6066,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Love well-nigh appeared to him now
6067,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Just like stolen fruit; he felt that,"
6068,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Like a thief, before the day broke,"
6069,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,He had better leave the castle.
6070,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"But just then the sun was rising,"
6071,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With the beauty of a bridegroom
6072,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In the blush of early morning.
6073,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Be ashamed, my heart, great coward!"
6074,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Yes, I'll ask him,"" cried young Werner."
6075,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6076,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6077,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,At his breakfast sat the Baron
6078,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Poring deeply o'er a letter
6079,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Which the day before was brought him
6080,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"By a messenger from Suabia,"
6081,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,From the Danube; where through narrow
6082,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Valleys the young stream is flowing,"
6083,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And steep limestone rocks are rising
6084,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,From the water which reflects them
6085,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With their verdant crowns of beech-trees;
6086,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Thence the man had come on horseback.
6087,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And the letter read as follows:
6088,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6089,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6090,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Does my comrade still remember"
6091,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,His old Hans von Wildenstein?
6092,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Down the Rhine and Danube many
6093,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Drops of water have been flowing,"
6094,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Since we in that war together
6095,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Lay before the bivouac-fire;
6096,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"And I see it by my son's growth,"
6097,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Who is now a strapping fellow--
6098,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Four-and-twenty years he reckons.
6099,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,First a page unto his highness
6100,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,The Grand Duke of Würtemberg;
6101,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Then to Tübingen I sent him.
6102,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"If I by his debts can judge well,"
6103,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Which I had to pay for him there,"
6104,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,He must have vast stores of knowledge.
6105,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Now he stays with me at home, at"
6106,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Wildenstein; is hunting stags here,"
6107,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Hunting foxes, hares and rabbits;"
6108,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,But sometimes the rascal even
6109,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Hunts the peasants' pretty daughters.
6110,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,So 'tis time to think of taming
6111,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Him beneath the yoke of marriage.
6112,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"If I err not, you, my friend, have"
6113,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Just a daughter suited for him.
6114,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With old comrades 'tis the custom
6115,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Not to beat around the bush, but"
6116,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Go straight forward to the business.
6117,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"So I ask you, shall my Damian"
6118,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Start upon a tour of courtship
6119,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,To your castle on the Rhine?
6120,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Answer soon. Receive the greetings
6121,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Of thy Hans von Wildenstein!
6122,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Postscript: Do you still remember"
6123,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"That great brawl we had at Augsburg,"
6124,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"And the rage of wealthy Fugger,"
6125,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"The ill-humour of his ladies,"
6126,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Two-and-thirty years ago?"""
6127,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6128,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6129,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With great effort tried the Baron
6130,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,His friend's writing to decipher.
6131,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Spent a good half-hour upon it
6132,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Ere he came to its conclusion.
6133,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Smiling said he then: ""A Suabian"
6134,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Is a devil of a fellow.
6135,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,One and all they are unpolished.
6136,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And coarse-grained is their whole nature;
6137,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,But within their square-built noddles
6138,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Lie rich stores of clever cunning.
6139,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Many stupid brainless fellows
6140,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Might from them obtain supplies.
6141,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Truly my old Hans now even
6142,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In old age is calculating
6143,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Like the best diplomatist.
6144,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"For, his much encumbered, rotten"
6145,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Owl's-nest out there on the Danube,"
6146,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Would be well propped up and rescued
6147,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,By a good rich marriage-portion.
6148,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Still his plan is worth considering;
6149,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"For, the name of Wildenstein is"
6150,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Well known all throughout the Empire,"
6151,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Since they followed as crusaders
6152,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In the train of Barbarossa.
6153,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Let the younker try his chance then!"""
6154,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6155,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6156,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Werner with most solemn aspect,"
6157,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Dressed in black, the room now entered;"
6158,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Sadness lay on his pale features.
6159,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In good humour spoke the Baron:
6160,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""I was wishing just to see you,"
6161,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,For I want you to be ready
6162,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"With your pen, and as my faithful"
6163,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Secretary write a letter,"
6164,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And a letter of importance.
6165,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,There's a knight who lives in Suabia
6166,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Questioning me about my daughter;
6167,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Asks her hand from me in marriage
6168,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"For his son, the younker Damian."
6169,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Write him then, how Margaretta"
6170,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Daily grows in grace and beauty;
6171,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,How she--but I need not tell you.
6172,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Think you are an artist--sketch then
6173,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"With your pen a life-like, faithful"
6174,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Portrait, not a jot forgetting."
6175,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Also write, to his proposal"
6176,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"I do offer no objection,"
6177,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"And the younker, if he pleases,"
6178,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"May come here and try his fortune."""
6179,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6180,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6181,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""May come here and try his fortune,"""
6182,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Said young Werner, as if dreaming,"
6183,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Mumbling to himself--when grimly
6184,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Said the Baron: ""What's the matter?"
6185,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,You have now as long a visage
6186,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,As a protestant old preacher
6187,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,On Good Friday. Is the fever
6188,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Coming once again to plague you?"""
6189,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Gravely answered him young Werner:
6190,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""I, my lord, can't write that letter,"
6191,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,You must find another penman;
6192,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"For, I come myself as suitor,"
6193,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Come to ask you for your daughter."""
6194,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6195,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6196,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Come--to ask you--for your daughter!"""
6197,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In his turn now said the Baron
6198,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,To himself--he made a wry mouth
6199,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"As one playing on the Jew's-harp,"
6200,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And he felt a sudden twitching
6201,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In his foot from his old enemy
6202,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Podagra, and gravely said:"
6203,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""My young friend, your brain is truly"
6204,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Still affected with the fever.
6205,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Hurry quickly to the garden;
6206,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"There stands in the shade a fountain,"
6207,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,There is flowing clear cool water;
6208,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,If you dip your head thrice in it
6209,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Then your fever soon will cool."""
6210,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6211,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6212,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Noble lord,"" now answered Werner,"
6213,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Spare your jokes, for you may better"
6214,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Use them, when the noble younker"
6215,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Comes here from the land of Suabia.
6216,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Calm and free from any fever
6217,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Have I on this step decided,"
6218,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And to Margaretta's father
6219,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"I repeat the same petition."""
6220,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6221,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6222,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Darkly frowning said the Baron:
6223,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Do you want to hear from me then"
6224,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,What your own good sense should tell you?
6225,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Most unwillingly I hurt you
6226,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,With harsh words; I've not forgotten
6227,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"That the wound upon your forehead,"
6228,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Hardly healed yet, you received here"
6229,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,By your ardour in my service.
6230,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,He who ventures as a suitor
6231,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,For my daughter first must show me
6232,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,That he comes of noble lineage.
6233,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Nature has set up strict barriers
6234,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Round us all with prescient wisdom,"
6235,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"To us all our sphere assigning,"
6236,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Wherein we the best may prosper.
6237,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,In the Holy Roman Empire
6238,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Is each rank defined most clearly--
6239,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Nobles, commoners, and peasants."
6240,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"If they keep within their circle,"
6241,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"From themselves their race renewing,"
6242,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,They'll remain then strong and healthy.
6243,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Each is then just like a column,"
6244,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Which supports the whole; but never
6245,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Should these classes mix together.
6246,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Do you know the consequences?
6247,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Our descendants would have something
6248,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Of each class, and yet be nothing--"
6249,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Shallow, good-for-nothing mongrels,"
6250,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Tossed about, because uprooted"
6251,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,From the soil of old tradition.
6252,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Firm, exclusive must a man be;"
6253,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And his course of life already
6254,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Must be inborn, an inheritance"
6255,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Coming down through generations.
6256,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Hence our custom does require
6257,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Equal rank when people marry;
6258,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And I hold as law this custom;
6259,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,I shall not allow a stranger
6260,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"To o'erleap this solid barrier,"
6261,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And no trumpeter shall therefore
6262,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Ever woo a noble lady."""
6263,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6264,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6265,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Thus the Baron. With great labour
6266,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Had he put the words together
6267,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Of this solemn and unusual
6268,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Theoretical discourse.
6269,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Meanwhile Hiddigeigei lying
6270,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"There, behind the stove, was listening."
6271,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"At the end assent he nodded,"
6272,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,But in thoughtful meditation
6273,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Raised his paw up to his forehead,"
6274,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Reasoning to himself as follows:
6275,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Why do people kiss each other?"
6276,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Never shall I solve this question!
6277,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"I did think at last I'd solved it,"
6278,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Thought that kisses might be useful
6279,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"As a means to stop one's talking,"
6280,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And prevent one from declaiming
6281,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Bitter stinging words of truth.
6282,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"But, alas, now this solution"
6283,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Seems, I must confess, erroneous;"
6284,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Else young Werner long before this
6285,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Would have kissed my good old master."""
6286,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6287,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6288,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"To the Baron said young Werner,"
6289,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And his voice was growing hollow:
6290,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Much I thank you for this lesson."
6291,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"'Midst the fir-trees of the mountains,"
6292,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"By the green waves of the river,"
6293,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"In the sunlight of the May-time,"
6294,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Has my eye been overlooking
6295,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,All these barriers of custom.
6296,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Thanks, that you have thus recalled them."
6297,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Also, thanks for all your kindness,"
6298,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Shown to me while on the Rhine.
6299,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Now my time is up, the meaning"
6300,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Of your words I thus interpret:
6301,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,'Right about face!' I go gladly.
6302,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,As a suitor fully equal
6303,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"I shall here return, or never."
6304,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Be not angry then--farewell!"""
6305,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Spoke, and from the room departed,"
6306,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,And he knew what must be done now.
6307,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,At the door with troubled glances
6308,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Still a long while gazed the Baron:
6309,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""I am really sad,"" he muttered,"
6310,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"""Wherefore is this brave youth's name not"
6311,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Damian von Wildenstein?"""
6312,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6313,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,
6314,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Parting, parting, dismal moment!"
6315,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Who first ever did invent it?
6316,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Surely 'twas a wicked man, far"
6317,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"In the Polar Sea, and freezing"
6318,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,Round his nose the polar wind blew;
6319,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"And his shaggy, jealous consort,"
6320,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Plagued him, so he no more relished"
6321,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,The sweet comfort of the train-oil.
6322,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"O'er his head he drew a yellow,"
6323,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"Furry sealskin, and then waving"
6324,WERNER SUES FOR MARGARETTA.,"With his fur-protected right hand,"

8176,THE MEETING IN ROME.,'Twas the Pope's own guard of honour.
8177,THE MEETING IN ROME.,And at last the Holy Father
8178,THE MEETING IN ROME.,"Made his entrance, being carried"
8179,THE MEETING IN ROME.,On a throne by eight strong bearers.
8180,THE MEETING IN ROME.,O'er his head were held by pages

8199,THE MEETING IN ROME.,"Were directed up to heaven,"
8200,THE MEETING IN ROME.,Whence these solemn strains of music
8201,THE MEETING IN ROME.,Seemed to her to be descending.
8202,THE MEETING IN ROME.,But her eye was then attracted
8203,THE MEETING IN ROME.,To the singers' box--she trembled:
8204,THE MEETING IN ROME.,"For, amid the group of singers,"
8205,THE MEETING IN ROME.,"Though half hidden by a column,"

8303,SOLUTION AND END.,But I truly take an interest
8304,SOLUTION AND END.,In the grave young Signor Werner.
8305,SOLUTION AND END.,Greatly has improved the singing
8306,SOLUTION AND END.,"Of my choir, since he leads it,"
8307,SOLUTION AND END.,And the taste for solemn music;
8308,SOLUTION AND END.,While my own Italian singers
8309,SOLUTION AND END.,Care too much for operatic
8310,SOLUTION AND END.,Tunes of lighter character.
8311,SOLUTION AND END.,"Quietly he does his duty,"
8312,SOLUTION AND END.,Of his own accord ne'er speaking;
8313,SOLUTION AND END.,Never begs of me a favour;
8314,SOLUTION AND END.,Never was his hand extended

8316,SOLUTION AND END.,Yet examples of corruption
8317,SOLUTION AND END.,"Are more frequent with us, surely,"

8319,SOLUTION AND END.,Monsignor Venusto knows this!
8320,SOLUTION AND END.,Seems to me that this grave German
8321,SOLUTION AND END.,Is consumed by secret sorrow.
8322,SOLUTION AND END.,"I should really like to know now,"
8323,SOLUTION AND END.,"If he's thinking of his love yet?"""
8324,SOLUTION AND END.,
8325,SOLUTION AND END.,
8326,SOLUTION AND END.,Said the Cardinal Albani:
8327,SOLUTION AND END.,"""I well-nigh may answer for this."
8328,SOLUTION AND END.,In the books kept on the conduct
8329,SOLUTION AND END.,Of all high and low officials
8330,SOLUTION AND END.,"In the State and Church departments,"
8331,SOLUTION AND END.,It is mentioned as a wonder
8332,SOLUTION AND END.,That he strictly shuns all women.
8333,SOLUTION AND END.,First we nourished a suspicion
8334,SOLUTION AND END.,That his heart had fallen victim
8335,SOLUTION AND END.,To the charms of the fair hostess
8336,SOLUTION AND END.,Of the inn near Vale Egeria.
8337,SOLUTION AND END.,He was seen each evening strolling
8338,SOLUTION AND END.,"Through the Porta Sebastiano,"
8339,SOLUTION AND END.,And outside there is no dwelling
8340,SOLUTION AND END.,But the tavern just now mentioned.
8341,SOLUTION AND END.,Thus such nightly promenading
8342,SOLUTION AND END.,Of one yet in early manhood
8343,SOLUTION AND END.,Could not but arouse suspicion.
8344,SOLUTION AND END.,Therefore we once sent two persons
8345,SOLUTION AND END.,"Carefully to track his footsteps,"
8346,SOLUTION AND END.,But they found him 'mid the ruined
8347,SOLUTION AND END.,Tombs along the Appian Way.
8348,SOLUTION AND END.,There had once a great patrician
8349,SOLUTION AND END.,"Built a tomb to his freed woman,"
8350,SOLUTION AND END.,Whom he'd brought as a remembrance
8351,SOLUTION AND END.,"From Judæa, at the time of"

8353,SOLUTION AND END.,She was called Zatcha Achyba.
8354,SOLUTION AND END.,"There he sat, the spies related;"
8355,SOLUTION AND END.,'Twas a subject for an artist:
8356,SOLUTION AND END.,The Campagna's sombre landscape;
8357,SOLUTION AND END.,Moonlight on the marble tombstone;
8358,SOLUTION AND END.,He his mantle wrapped around him;
8359,SOLUTION AND END.,Mournfully he blew his trumpet
8360,SOLUTION AND END.,Through the gloomy lonely silence.
8361,SOLUTION AND END.,This had brought upon him later
8362,SOLUTION AND END.,Many mocking jeers like this one:
8363,SOLUTION AND END.,'Signor Werner is composing
8364,SOLUTION AND END.,"For the Jewess there a requiem.'"""
8365,SOLUTION AND END.,
8366,SOLUTION AND END.,
8367,SOLUTION AND END.,"At this smiled the Holy Father,"
8368,SOLUTION AND END.,And the Cardinals did likewise;

8370,SOLUTION AND END.,All the chamberlains smiled also;

8372,SOLUTION AND END.,Now relaxed their gloomy sadness.
8373,SOLUTION AND END.,"And the Pope said: ""We must all have"

8383,SOLUTION AND END.,
8384,SOLUTION AND END.,
8385,SOLUTION AND END.,On the first day of July in
8386,SOLUTION AND END.,"Sixteen hundred seventy-nine, there"
8387,SOLUTION AND END.,Rose the sun with special glory.
8388,SOLUTION AND END.,Cooling blew the tramontana
8389,SOLUTION AND END.,Through the cypresses and myrtles
8390,SOLUTION AND END.,In the Vatican's fair garden;
8391,SOLUTION AND END.,And the half-parched flowers gladly
8392,SOLUTION AND END.,"Raised their heads, breathed out fresh fragrance,"
8393,SOLUTION AND END.,"O'er the bronze gigantic pine-cone,--"
8394,SOLUTION AND END.,Which once Hadrian's museum

8402,SOLUTION AND END.,E'en the pale old marble statues
8403,SOLUTION AND END.,With warm life became imbued.
8404,SOLUTION AND END.,"And the satyr, with his reed flute,"
8405,SOLUTION AND END.,Raised his foot as if intending

8407,SOLUTION AND END.,But Apollo's hand waved warning:

8417,SOLUTION AND END.,
8418,SOLUTION AND END.,
8419,SOLUTION AND END.,Through the Boscareccio's verdant

8422,SOLUTION AND END.,To the Abbess and the maiden
8423,SOLUTION AND END.,Here had granted audience.
8424,SOLUTION AND END.,"And the Abbess gained assurance,"
8425,SOLUTION AND END.,That her lawsuit would be taken

8427,SOLUTION AND END.,Then to Margaretta turning.
8428,SOLUTION AND END.,"Said the Pope: ""None of the pilgrims"

8432,SOLUTION AND END.,And he whispered to a servant:
8433,SOLUTION AND END.,"""Go and fetch the chapel-master."""
8434,SOLUTION AND END.,
8435,SOLUTION AND END.,
8436,SOLUTION AND END.,Werner came: to stately manhood
8437,SOLUTION AND END.,In this southern clime he'd ripened
8438,SOLUTION AND END.,"Since he left, a hopeless suitor,"
8439,SOLUTION AND END.,The old castle in the Rhine-land.
8440,SOLUTION AND END.,"Life's wild whirlpool, since that morning,"
8441,SOLUTION AND END.,Had well tossed him hither thither.
8442,SOLUTION AND END.,"Willingly I would relate here,"
8443,SOLUTION AND END.,How he went to many countries;
8444,SOLUTION AND END.,How o'er land and sea he travelled;
8445,SOLUTION AND END.,How he with the Knights of Malta
8446,SOLUTION AND END.,Cruised against the Turkish corsairs;
8447,SOLUTION AND END.,Till at last a fate mysterious
8448,SOLUTION AND END.,Unto Rome had duly brought him.
8449,SOLUTION AND END.,But my song becomes impatient;
8450,SOLUTION AND END.,Like a driver who is snapping
8451,SOLUTION AND END.,"At the door his whip, 'tis calling:"

8453,SOLUTION AND END.,Werner came; bewildered gazed he
8454,SOLUTION AND END.,"Twice, yes thrice, at Margaretta,"
8455,SOLUTION AND END.,Gazed at her in utter silence;
8456,SOLUTION AND END.,But his glances did express more
8457,SOLUTION AND END.,Than a printed folio volume.
8458,SOLUTION AND END.,'Twas the glance with which Ulysses
8459,SOLUTION AND END.,Sitting by the suitors' corpses
8460,SOLUTION AND END.,"Gazed upon his consort, from whom"
8461,SOLUTION AND END.,He by twenty years of wandering
8462,SOLUTION AND END.,And of suffering had been parted.

8465,SOLUTION AND END.,Innocentius the Eleventh

8476,SOLUTION AND END.,"""'Tis indeed a mighty power"
8477,SOLUTION AND END.,"Love, a power all subduing;"

8480,SOLUTION AND END.,And the chair of Peter also
8481,SOLUTION AND END.,Is not safe from its invasion
8482,SOLUTION AND END.,When it asks us for our help.
8483,SOLUTION AND END.,"""But it is a pleasant duty"

8493,SOLUTION AND END.,"From the Holy Land, though knowing"

8507,SOLUTION AND END.,There is only a slight scruple--
8508,SOLUTION AND END.,If I've heard right--with the Baron.
8509,SOLUTION AND END.,"You, my Werner, have been faithful,"

8547,SOLUTION AND END.,And overwhelmed with grateful feelings
8548,SOLUTION AND END.,Werner knelt with Margaretta

8563,SOLUTION AND END.,To give vent unto this feeling
8564,SOLUTION AND END.,"He is going to the wine-house,"
8565,SOLUTION AND END.,To the tavern del Fachino.
8566,SOLUTION AND END.,And to-night he is not drinking
8567,SOLUTION AND END.,Country wine in fogliette;

8887,NOTES.,"obscure until the time of the Emperor Rudolph of Hapsburg, when it"

8889,NOTES.,"the German throne between Albrecht of Austria and Adolphe of Nassau,"
8890,NOTES.,"and between Frederick the Beautiful and Ludwig of Bavaria, when Suabia"
8891,NOTES.,"was without a duke and Germany without an emperor, the different"

8893,NOTES.,There is still in existence such a union document drawn up in the year
8894,NOTES.,"1433. The entire union was divided into eight smaller ones, each of"
8895,NOTES.,which stood under an elected leader (Einungsmeister). All these eight
8896,NOTES.,"leaders elected one of their body as speaker (Redmann), who held the"
8897,NOTES.,leadership of the entire union. By this the Hauenstein peasants were
8898,NOTES.,greatly protected in their ancient rights; still the oppression of the
8899,NOTES.,"Austrian governors (Waldvoegte) often incited revolutions, the most"
8900,NOTES.,important of which occurred during the Peasants' War in 1525. Others
