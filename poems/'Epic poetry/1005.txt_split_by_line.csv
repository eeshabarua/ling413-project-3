62,CANTO I,
63,CANTO I,"In the midway of this our mortal life,"
64,CANTO I,"I found me in a gloomy wood, astray"
65,CANTO I,Gone from the path direct: and e’en to tell
66,CANTO I,"It were no easy task, how savage wild"
67,CANTO I,"That forest, how robust and rough its growth,"
68,CANTO I,"Which to remember only, my dismay"
69,CANTO I,"Renews, in bitterness not far from death."
70,CANTO I,"Yet to discourse of what there good befell,"
71,CANTO I,All else will I relate discover’d there.
72,CANTO I,"How first I enter’d it I scarce can say,"
73,CANTO I,Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh’d
74,CANTO I,"My senses down, when the true path I left,"
75,CANTO I,"But when a mountain’s foot I reach’d, where clos’d"
76,CANTO I,"The valley, that had pierc’d my heart with dread,"
77,CANTO I,"I look’d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad"
78,CANTO I,"Already vested with that planet’s beam,"
79,CANTO I,Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.
80,CANTO I,
81,CANTO I,"Then was a little respite to the fear,"
82,CANTO I,"That in my heart’s recesses deep had lain,"
83,CANTO I,"All of that night, so pitifully pass’d:"
84,CANTO I,"And as a man, with difficult short breath,"
85,CANTO I,"Forespent with toiling, ’scap’d from sea to shore,"
86,CANTO I,"Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands"
87,CANTO I,"At gaze; e’en so my spirit, that yet fail’d"
88,CANTO I,"Struggling with terror, turn’d to view the straits,"
89,CANTO I,That none hath pass’d and liv’d. My weary frame
90,CANTO I,"After short pause recomforted, again"
91,CANTO I,"I journey’d on over that lonely steep,"
92,CANTO I,
93,CANTO I,The hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent
94,CANTO I,"Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,"
95,CANTO I,"And cover’d with a speckled skin, appear’d,"
96,CANTO I,"Nor, when it saw me, vanish’d, rather strove"
97,CANTO I,To check my onward going; that ofttimes
98,CANTO I,With purpose to retrace my steps I turn’d.
99,CANTO I,
100,CANTO I,"The hour was morning’s prime, and on his way"
101,CANTO I,"Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,"
102,CANTO I,"That with him rose, when Love divine first mov’d"
103,CANTO I,Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope
104,CANTO I,"All things conspir’d to fill me, the gay skin"
105,CANTO I,"Of that swift animal, the matin dawn"
106,CANTO I,"And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas’d,"
107,CANTO I,"And by new dread succeeded, when in view"
108,CANTO I,"A lion came, ’gainst me, as it appear’d,"
109,CANTO I,
110,CANTO I,"With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,"
111,CANTO I,That e’en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf
112,CANTO I,"Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem’d"
113,CANTO I,"Full of all wants, and many a land hath made"
114,CANTO I,Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear
115,CANTO I,"O’erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall’d,"
116,CANTO I,"That of the height all hope I lost. As one,"
117,CANTO I,"Who with his gain elated, sees the time"
118,CANTO I,"When all unwares is gone, he inwardly"
119,CANTO I,"Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,"
120,CANTO I,"Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,"
121,CANTO I,"Who coming o’er against me, by degrees"
122,CANTO I,Impell’d me where the sun in silence rests.
123,CANTO I,
124,CANTO I,While to the lower space with backward step
125,CANTO I,"I fell, my ken discern’d the form one of one,"
126,CANTO I,Whose voice seem’d faint through long disuse of speech.
127,CANTO I,"When him in that great desert I espied,"
128,CANTO I,"“Have mercy on me!” cried I out aloud,"
129,CANTO I,“Spirit! or living man! what e’er thou be!”
130,CANTO I,
131,CANTO I,"He answer’d: “Now not man, man once I was,"
132,CANTO I,"And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both"
133,CANTO I,"By country, when the power of Julius yet"
134,CANTO I,Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past
135,CANTO I,"Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time"
136,CANTO I,Of fabled deities and false. A bard
137,CANTO I,"Was I, and made Anchises’ upright son"
138,CANTO I,"The subject of my song, who came from Troy,"
139,CANTO I,When the flames prey’d on Ilium’s haughty towers.
140,CANTO I,"But thou, say wherefore to such perils past"
141,CANTO I,Return’st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount
142,CANTO I,"Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?”"
143,CANTO I,"“And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,"
144,CANTO I,From which such copious floods of eloquence
145,CANTO I,Have issued?” I with front abash’d replied.
146,CANTO I,“Glory and light of all the tuneful train!
147,CANTO I,May it avail me that I long with zeal
148,CANTO I,"Have sought thy volume, and with love immense"
149,CANTO I,Have conn’d it o’er. My master thou and guide!
150,CANTO I,Thou he from whom alone I have deriv’d
151,CANTO I,"That style, which for its beauty into fame"
152,CANTO I,"Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled."
153,CANTO I,"O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!”"
154,CANTO I,
155,CANTO I,“For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
156,CANTO I,"She hath made tremble.” He, soon as he saw"
157,CANTO I,"That I was weeping, answer’d, “Thou must needs"
158,CANTO I,"Another way pursue, if thou wouldst ’scape"
159,CANTO I,"From out that savage wilderness. This beast,"
160,CANTO I,"At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none"
161,CANTO I,"To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:"
162,CANTO I,"So bad and so accursed in her kind,"
163,CANTO I,"That never sated is her ravenous will,"
164,CANTO I,Still after food more craving than before.
165,CANTO I,To many an animal in wedlock vile
166,CANTO I,"She fastens, and shall yet to many more,"
167,CANTO I,"Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy"
168,CANTO I,Her with sharp pain. He will not life support
169,CANTO I,"By earth nor its base metals, but by love,"
170,CANTO I,"Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be"
171,CANTO I,The land ’twixt either Feltro. In his might
172,CANTO I,"Shall safety to Italia’s plains arise,"
173,CANTO I,"For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,"
174,CANTO I,"Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell."
175,CANTO I,He with incessant chase through every town
176,CANTO I,"Shall worry, until he to hell at length"
177,CANTO I,"Restore her, thence by envy first let loose."
178,CANTO I,"I for thy profit pond’ring now devise,"
179,CANTO I,"That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide"
180,CANTO I,"Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,"
181,CANTO I,"Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see"
182,CANTO I,"Spirits of old tormented, who invoke"
183,CANTO I,"A second death; and those next view, who dwell"
184,CANTO I,"Content in fire, for that they hope to come,"
185,CANTO I,"Whene’er the time may be, among the blest,"
186,CANTO I,Into whose regions if thou then desire
187,CANTO I,"T’ ascend, a spirit worthier then I"
188,CANTO I,"Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,"
189,CANTO I,"Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,"
190,CANTO I,"Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,"
191,CANTO I,"Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,"
192,CANTO I,That to his city none through me should come.
193,CANTO I,"He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds"
194,CANTO I,"His citadel and throne. O happy those,"
195,CANTO I,Whom there he chooses!” I to him in few:
196,CANTO I,"“Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,"
197,CANTO I,I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse
198,CANTO I,"I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,"
199,CANTO I,"That I Saint Peter’s gate may view, and those"
200,CANTO I,"Who as thou tell’st, are in such dismal plight.”"
201,CANTO I,
202,CANTO I,"Onward he mov’d, I close his steps pursu’d."

208,CANTO II,
209,CANTO II,
210,CANTO II,"Now was the day departing, and the air,"
211,CANTO II,"Imbrown’d with shadows, from their toils releas’d"
212,CANTO II,All animals on earth; and I alone
213,CANTO II,"Prepar’d myself the conflict to sustain,"
214,CANTO II,"Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,"
215,CANTO II,Which my unerring memory shall retrace.
216,CANTO II,
217,CANTO II,O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe
218,CANTO II,Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept
219,CANTO II,"Safe in a written record, here thy worth"
220,CANTO II,And eminent endowments come to proof.
221,CANTO II,
222,CANTO II,"I thus began: “Bard! thou who art my guide,"
223,CANTO II,"Consider well, if virtue be in me"
224,CANTO II,"Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise"
225,CANTO II,"Thou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius’ sire,"
226,CANTO II,"Yet cloth’d in corruptible flesh, among"
227,CANTO II,"Th’ immortal tribes had entrance, and was there"
228,CANTO II,"Sensible present. Yet if heaven’s great Lord,"
229,CANTO II,"Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew’d,"
230,CANTO II,"In contemplation of the high effect,"
231,CANTO II,"Both what and who from him should issue forth,"
232,CANTO II,It seems in reason’s judgment well deserv’d:
233,CANTO II,"Sith he of Rome, and of Rome’s empire wide,"
234,CANTO II,In heaven’s empyreal height was chosen sire:
235,CANTO II,"Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain’d"
236,CANTO II,"And ’stablish’d for the holy place, where sits"
237,CANTO II,Who to great Peter’s sacred chair succeeds.
238,CANTO II,"He from this journey, in thy song renown’d,"
239,CANTO II,"Learn’d things, that to his victory gave rise"
240,CANTO II,And to the papal robe. In after-times
241,CANTO II,"The chosen vessel also travel’d there,"
242,CANTO II,"To bring us back assurance in that faith,"
243,CANTO II,Which is the entrance to salvation’s way.
244,CANTO II,"But I, why should I there presume? or who"
245,CANTO II,"Permits it? not, Aeneas I nor Paul."
246,CANTO II,"Myself I deem not worthy, and none else"
247,CANTO II,"Will deem me. I, if on this voyage then"
248,CANTO II,"I venture, fear it will in folly end."
249,CANTO II,"Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know’st,"
250,CANTO II,"Than I can speak.” As one, who unresolves"
251,CANTO II,"What he hath late resolv’d, and with new thoughts"
252,CANTO II,"Changes his purpose, from his first intent"
253,CANTO II,"Remov’d; e’en such was I on that dun coast,"
254,CANTO II,"Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first"
255,CANTO II,So eagerly embrac’d. “If right thy words
256,CANTO II,"I scan,” replied that shade magnanimous,"
257,CANTO II,"“Thy soul is by vile fear assail’d, which oft"
258,CANTO II,"So overcasts a man, that he recoils"
259,CANTO II,"From noblest resolution, like a beast"
260,CANTO II,At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.
261,CANTO II,"That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,"
262,CANTO II,"I will instruct thee why I came, and what"
263,CANTO II,"I heard in that same instant, when for thee"
264,CANTO II,"Grief touch’d me first. I was among the tribe,"
265,CANTO II,"Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest"
266,CANTO II,"And lovely, I besought her to command,"
267,CANTO II,Call’d me; her eyes were brighter than the star
268,CANTO II,Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft
269,CANTO II,Angelically tun’d her speech address’d:
270,CANTO II,“O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame
271,CANTO II,"Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!"
272,CANTO II,"A friend, not of my fortune but myself,"
273,CANTO II,On the wide desert in his road has met
274,CANTO II,"Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn’d."
275,CANTO II,"Now much I dread lest he past help have stray’d,"
276,CANTO II,"And I be ris’n too late for his relief,"
277,CANTO II,"From what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,"
278,CANTO II,"And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,"
279,CANTO II,"And by all means for his deliverance meet,"
280,CANTO II,Assist him. So to me will comfort spring.
281,CANTO II,I who now bid thee on this errand forth
282,CANTO II,Am Beatrice; from a place I come
283,CANTO II,"Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence,"
284,CANTO II,Who prompts my speech. When in my Master’s sight
285,CANTO II,"I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.”"
286,CANTO II,
287,CANTO II,"(Note: Beatrice. I use this word, as it is"
288,CANTO II,"pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four"
289,CANTO II,"syllables, of which the third is a long one.)"
290,CANTO II,
291,CANTO II,
292,CANTO II,"She then was silent, and I thus began:"
293,CANTO II,"“O Lady! by whose influence alone,"
294,CANTO II,Mankind excels whatever is contain’d
295,CANTO II,"Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,"
296,CANTO II,"So thy command delights me, that to obey,"
297,CANTO II,"If it were done already, would seem late."
298,CANTO II,No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;
299,CANTO II,"Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth"
300,CANTO II,"To leave that ample space, where to return"
301,CANTO II,"Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.”"
302,CANTO II,
303,CANTO II,"She then: “Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,"
304,CANTO II,"I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread"
305,CANTO II,Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone
306,CANTO II,"Are to be fear’d, whence evil may proceed,"
307,CANTO II,"None else, for none are terrible beside."
308,CANTO II,"I am so fram’d by God, thanks to his grace!"
309,CANTO II,That any suff’rance of your misery
310,CANTO II,"Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire"
311,CANTO II,Assails me. In high heaven a blessed dame
312,CANTO II,"Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief"
313,CANTO II,"That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,"
314,CANTO II,That God’s stern judgment to her will inclines.”
315,CANTO II,"To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:"
316,CANTO II,“Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
317,CANTO II,And I commend him to thee.” At her word
318,CANTO II,"Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,"
319,CANTO II,"And coming to the place, where I abode"
320,CANTO II,"Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,"
321,CANTO II,She thus address’d me: “Thou true praise of God!
322,CANTO II,Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent
323,CANTO II,"To him, who so much lov’d thee, as to leave"
324,CANTO II,For thy sake all the multitude admires?
325,CANTO II,"Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,"
326,CANTO II,"Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,"
327,CANTO II,"Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?”"
328,CANTO II,“Ne’er among men did any with such speed
329,CANTO II,"Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,"
330,CANTO II,"As when these words were spoken, I came here,"
331,CANTO II,"Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force"
332,CANTO II,"Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all"
333,CANTO II,"Who well have mark’d it, into honour brings.”"
334,CANTO II,
335,CANTO II,"“When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes"
336,CANTO II,Tearful she turn’d aside; whereat I felt
337,CANTO II,"Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will’d,"
338,CANTO II,"Thus am I come: I sav’d thee from the beast,"
339,CANTO II,Who thy near way across the goodly mount
340,CANTO II,Prevented. What is this comes o’er thee then?
341,CANTO II,"Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast"
342,CANTO II,Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there
343,CANTO II,And noble daring? Since three maids so blest
344,CANTO II,"Thy safety plan, e’en in the court of heaven;"
345,CANTO II,And so much certain good my words forebode.”
346,CANTO II,
347,CANTO II,"As florets, by the frosty air of night"
348,CANTO II,"Bent down and clos’d, when day has blanch’d their leaves,"
349,CANTO II,Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;
350,CANTO II,"So was my fainting vigour new restor’d,"
351,CANTO II,"And to my heart such kindly courage ran,"
352,CANTO II,That I as one undaunted soon replied:
353,CANTO II,"“O full of pity she, who undertook"
354,CANTO II,My succour! and thou kind who didst perform
355,CANTO II,So soon her true behest! With such desire
356,CANTO II,"Thou hast dispos’d me to renew my voyage,"
357,CANTO II,That my first purpose fully is resum’d.
358,CANTO II,Lead on: one only will is in us both.
359,CANTO II,"Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.”"
360,CANTO II,
361,CANTO II,"So spake I; and when he had onward mov’d,"
362,CANTO II,I enter’d on the deep and woody way.
363,CANTO II,
364,CANTO II,
365,CANTO II,
366,CANTO II,
367,CANTO III,CANTO III
368,CANTO III,
369,CANTO III,
370,CANTO III,“Through me you pass into the city of woe:
371,CANTO III,Through me you pass into eternal pain:
372,CANTO III,Through me among the people lost for aye.
373,CANTO III,Justice the founder of my fabric mov’d:
374,CANTO III,"To rear me was the task of power divine,"
375,CANTO III,"Supremest wisdom, and primeval love."
376,CANTO III,"Before me things create were none, save things"
377,CANTO III,"Eternal, and eternal I endure."
378,CANTO III,
379,CANTO III,“All hope abandon ye who enter here.”
380,CANTO III,
381,CANTO III,Such characters in colour dim I mark’d
382,CANTO III,Over a portal’s lofty arch inscrib’d:
383,CANTO III,"Whereat I thus: “Master, these words import"
384,CANTO III,Hard meaning.” He as one prepar’d replied:
385,CANTO III,“Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;
386,CANTO III,Here be vile fear extinguish’d. We are come
387,CANTO III,Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
388,CANTO III,"To misery doom’d, who intellectual good"
389,CANTO III,Have lost.” And when his hand he had stretch’d forth
390,CANTO III,"To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer’d,"
391,CANTO III,Into that secret place he led me on.
392,CANTO III,
393,CANTO III,Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
394,CANTO III,"Resounded through the air pierc’d by no star,"
395,CANTO III,"That e’en I wept at entering. Various tongues,"
396,CANTO III,"Horrible languages, outcries of woe,"
397,CANTO III,"Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,"
398,CANTO III,"With hands together smote that swell’d the sounds,"
399,CANTO III,"Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls"
400,CANTO III,"Round through that air with solid darkness stain’d,"
401,CANTO III,Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.
402,CANTO III,
403,CANTO III,"I then, with error yet encompass’d, cried:"
404,CANTO III,“O master! What is this I hear? What race
405,CANTO III,"Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?”"
406,CANTO III,
407,CANTO III,He thus to me: “This miserable fate
408,CANTO III,"Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv’d"
409,CANTO III,"Without or praise or blame, with that ill band"
410,CANTO III,"Of angels mix’d, who nor rebellious prov’d"
411,CANTO III,"Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves"
412,CANTO III,"Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,"
413,CANTO III,"Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth"
414,CANTO III,"Of Hell receives them, lest th’ accursed tribe"
415,CANTO III,Should glory thence with exultation vain.”
416,CANTO III,
417,CANTO III,"I then: “Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,"
418,CANTO III,That they lament so loud?” He straight replied:
419,CANTO III,“That will I tell thee briefly. These of death
420,CANTO III,No hope may entertain: and their blind life
421,CANTO III,"So meanly passes, that all other lots"
422,CANTO III,"They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,"
423,CANTO III,Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.
424,CANTO III,"Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.”"
425,CANTO III,
426,CANTO III,"And I, who straightway look’d, beheld a flag,"
427,CANTO III,"Which whirling ran around so rapidly,"
428,CANTO III,That it no pause obtain’d: and following came
429,CANTO III,"Such a long train of spirits, I should ne’er"
430,CANTO III,"Have thought, that death so many had despoil’d."
431,CANTO III,
432,CANTO III,"When some of these I recogniz’d, I saw"
433,CANTO III,"And knew the shade of him, who to base fear"
434,CANTO III,"Yielding, abjur’d his high estate. Forthwith"
435,CANTO III,I understood for certain this the tribe
436,CANTO III,Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
437,CANTO III,"And to his foes. These wretches, who ne’er lived,"
438,CANTO III,"Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung"
439,CANTO III,"By wasps and hornets, which bedew’d their cheeks"
440,CANTO III,"With blood, that mix’d with tears dropp’d to their feet,"
441,CANTO III,And by disgustful worms was gather’d there.
442,CANTO III,
443,CANTO III,Then looking farther onwards I beheld
444,CANTO III,A throng upon the shore of a great stream:
445,CANTO III,Whereat I thus: “Sir! grant me now to know
446,CANTO III,"Whom here we view, and whence impell’d they seem"
447,CANTO III,"So eager to pass o’er, as I discern"
448,CANTO III,Through the blear light?” He thus to me in few:
449,CANTO III,"“This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive"
450,CANTO III,Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.”
451,CANTO III,
452,CANTO III,"Then with eyes downward cast and fill’d with shame,"
453,CANTO III,"Fearing my words offensive to his ear,"
454,CANTO III,"Till we had reach’d the river, I from speech"
455,CANTO III,Abstain’d. And lo! toward us in a bark
456,CANTO III,"Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,"
457,CANTO III,
458,CANTO III,"Crying, “Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not"
459,CANTO III,Ever to see the sky again. I come
460,CANTO III,"To take you to the other shore across,"
461,CANTO III,"Into eternal darkness, there to dwell"
462,CANTO III,"In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there"
463,CANTO III,"Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave"
464,CANTO III,These who are dead.” But soon as he beheld
465,CANTO III,"I left them not, “By other way,” said he,"
466,CANTO III,"“By other haven shalt thou come to shore,"
467,CANTO III,Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat
468,CANTO III,Must carry.” Then to him thus spake my guide:
469,CANTO III,"“Charon! thyself torment not: so ’t is will’d,"
470,CANTO III,Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.”
471,CANTO III,
472,CANTO III,Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
473,CANTO III,"Of him the boatman o’er the livid lake,"
474,CANTO III,Around whose eyes glar’d wheeling flames. Meanwhile
475,CANTO III,"Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang’d,"
476,CANTO III,"And gnash’d their teeth, soon as the cruel words"
477,CANTO III,"They heard. God and their parents they blasphem’d,"
478,CANTO III,"The human kind, the place, the time, and seed"
479,CANTO III,That did engender them and give them birth.
480,CANTO III,
481,CANTO III,Then all together sorely wailing drew
482,CANTO III,"To the curs’d strand, that every man must pass"
483,CANTO III,"Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,"
484,CANTO III,"With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,"
485,CANTO III,"Beck’ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar"
486,CANTO III,"Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves,"
487,CANTO III,"One still another following, till the bough"
488,CANTO III,Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;
489,CANTO III,
490,CANTO III,E’en in like manner Adam’s evil brood
491,CANTO III,"Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,"
492,CANTO III,"Each at a beck, as falcon at his call."
493,CANTO III,
494,CANTO III,"Thus go they over through the umber’d wave,"
495,CANTO III,And ever they on the opposing bank
496,CANTO III,"Be landed, on this side another throng"
497,CANTO III,"Still gathers. “Son,” thus spake the courteous guide,"
498,CANTO III,"“Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,"
499,CANTO III,"All here together come from every clime,"
500,CANTO III,And to o’erpass the river are not loth:
501,CANTO III,"For so heaven’s justice goads them on, that fear"
502,CANTO III,Is turn’d into desire. Hence ne’er hath past
503,CANTO III,"Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain,"
504,CANTO III,Now mayst thou know the import of his words.”
505,CANTO III,
506,CANTO III,"This said, the gloomy region trembling shook"
507,CANTO III,"So terribly, that yet with clammy dews"
508,CANTO III,"Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,"
509,CANTO III,"That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,"
510,CANTO III,"Which all my senses conquer’d quite, and I"
511,CANTO III,"Down dropp’d, as one with sudden slumber seiz’d."
512,CANTO III,
513,CANTO III,
514,CANTO III,
515,CANTO III,
516,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
517,CANTO IV,
518,CANTO IV,
519,CANTO IV,Broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash
520,CANTO IV,"Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,"
521,CANTO IV,"As one by main force rous’d. Risen upright,"
522,CANTO IV,"My rested eyes I mov’d around, and search’d"
523,CANTO IV,"With fixed ken to know what place it was,"
524,CANTO IV,Wherein I stood. For certain on the brink
525,CANTO IV,"I found me of the lamentable vale,"
526,CANTO IV,"The dread abyss, that joins a thund’rous sound"
527,CANTO IV,"Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,"
528,CANTO IV,"And thick with clouds o’erspread, mine eye in vain"
529,CANTO IV,"Explor’d its bottom, nor could aught discern."
530,CANTO IV,
531,CANTO IV,“Now let us to the blind world there beneath
532,CANTO IV,Descend;” the bard began all pale of look:
533,CANTO IV,"“I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.”"
534,CANTO IV,
535,CANTO IV,"Then I his alter’d hue perceiving, thus:"
536,CANTO IV,"“How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,"
537,CANTO IV,Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?”
538,CANTO IV,
539,CANTO IV,He then: “The anguish of that race below
540,CANTO IV,"With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear"
541,CANTO IV,Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way
542,CANTO IV,"Urges to haste.” Onward, this said, he mov’d;"
543,CANTO IV,And ent’ring led me with him on the bounds
544,CANTO IV,"Of the first circle, that surrounds th’ abyss."
545,CANTO IV,"Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard"
546,CANTO IV,"Except of sighs, that made th’ eternal air"
547,CANTO IV,"Tremble, not caus’d by tortures, but from grief"
548,CANTO IV,"Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,"
549,CANTO IV,"Of men, women, and infants. Then to me"
550,CANTO IV,The gentle guide: “Inquir’st thou not what spirits
551,CANTO IV,"Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass"
552,CANTO IV,"Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin"
553,CANTO IV,"Were blameless; and if aught they merited,"
554,CANTO IV,"It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,"
555,CANTO IV,The portal to thy faith. If they before
556,CANTO IV,"The Gospel liv’d, they serv’d not God aright;"
557,CANTO IV,"And among such am I. For these defects,"
558,CANTO IV,"And for no other evil, we are lost;”"
559,CANTO IV,
560,CANTO IV,"“Only so far afflicted, that we live"
561,CANTO IV,Desiring without hope.” So grief assail’d
562,CANTO IV,"My heart at hearing this, for well I knew"
563,CANTO IV,Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
564,CANTO IV,"Of mighty worth. “O tell me, sire rever’d!"
565,CANTO IV,"Tell me, my master!” I began through wish"
566,CANTO IV,"Of full assurance in that holy faith,"
567,CANTO IV,"Which vanquishes all error; “say, did e’er"
568,CANTO IV,"Any, or through his own or other’s merit,"
569,CANTO IV,"Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?”"
570,CANTO IV,
571,CANTO IV,"Piercing the secret purport of my speech,"
572,CANTO IV,"He answer’d: “I was new to that estate,"
573,CANTO IV,When I beheld a puissant one arrive
574,CANTO IV,"Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown’d."
575,CANTO IV,"He forth the shade of our first parent drew,"
576,CANTO IV,"Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,"
577,CANTO IV,"Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv’d,"
578,CANTO IV,"Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,"
579,CANTO IV,"Israel with his sire and with his sons,"
580,CANTO IV,"Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,"
581,CANTO IV,"And others many more, whom he to bliss"
582,CANTO IV,"Exalted. Before these, be thou assur’d,"
583,CANTO IV,No spirit of human kind was ever sav’d.”
584,CANTO IV,
585,CANTO IV,"We, while he spake, ceas’d not our onward road,"
586,CANTO IV,Still passing through the wood; for so I name
587,CANTO IV,Those spirits thick beset. We were not far
588,CANTO IV,"On this side from the summit, when I kenn’d"
589,CANTO IV,"A flame, that o’er the darken’d hemisphere"
590,CANTO IV,Prevailing shin’d. Yet we a little space
591,CANTO IV,"Were distant, not so far but I in part"
592,CANTO IV,"Discover’d, that a tribe in honour high"
593,CANTO IV,"That place possess’d. “O thou, who every art"
594,CANTO IV,"And science valu’st! who are these, that boast"
595,CANTO IV,"Such honour, separate from all the rest?”"
596,CANTO IV,
597,CANTO IV,He answer’d: “The renown of their great names
598,CANTO IV,"That echoes through your world above, acquires"
599,CANTO IV,"Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc’d.”"
600,CANTO IV,Meantime a voice I heard: “Honour the bard
601,CANTO IV,Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!”
602,CANTO IV,"No sooner ceas’d the sound, than I beheld"
603,CANTO IV,"Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,"
604,CANTO IV,Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.
605,CANTO IV,
606,CANTO IV,"When thus my master kind began: “Mark him,"
607,CANTO IV,"Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,"
608,CANTO IV,"The other three preceding, as their lord."
609,CANTO IV,"This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:"
610,CANTO IV,Flaccus the next in satire’s vein excelling;
611,CANTO IV,The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.
612,CANTO IV,"Because they all that appellation own,"
613,CANTO IV,"With which the voice singly accosted me,"
614,CANTO IV,"Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.”"
615,CANTO IV,
616,CANTO IV,So I beheld united the bright school
617,CANTO IV,"Of him the monarch of sublimest song,"
618,CANTO IV,That o’er the others like an eagle soars.
619,CANTO IV,"When they together short discourse had held,"
620,CANTO IV,"They turn’d to me, with salutation kind"
621,CANTO IV,Beck’ning me; at the which my master smil’d:
622,CANTO IV,Nor was this all; but greater honour still
623,CANTO IV,"They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;"
624,CANTO IV,And I was sixth amid so learn’d a band.
625,CANTO IV,
626,CANTO IV,Far as the luminous beacon on we pass’d
627,CANTO IV,"Speaking of matters, then befitting well"
628,CANTO IV,"To speak, now fitter left untold. At foot"
629,CANTO IV,"Of a magnificent castle we arriv’d,"
630,CANTO IV,"Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round"
631,CANTO IV,Defended by a pleasant stream. O’er this
632,CANTO IV,As o’er dry land we pass’d. Next through seven gates
633,CANTO IV,"I with those sages enter’d, and we came"
634,CANTO IV,Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
635,CANTO IV,
636,CANTO IV,"There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around"
637,CANTO IV,"Majestically mov’d, and in their port"
638,CANTO IV,Bore eminent authority; they spake
639,CANTO IV,"Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet."
640,CANTO IV,
641,CANTO IV,"We to one side retir’d, into a place"
642,CANTO IV,"Open and bright and lofty, whence each one"
643,CANTO IV,Stood manifest to view. Incontinent
644,CANTO IV,There on the green enamel of the plain
645,CANTO IV,"Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight"
646,CANTO IV,I am exalted in my own esteem.
647,CANTO IV,
648,CANTO IV,Electra there I saw accompanied
649,CANTO IV,"By many, among whom Hector I knew,"
650,CANTO IV,"Anchises’ pious son, and with hawk’s eye"
651,CANTO IV,"Caesar all arm’d, and by Camilla there"
652,CANTO IV,Penthesilea. On the other side
653,CANTO IV,"Old King Latinus, seated by his child"
654,CANTO IV,"Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,"
655,CANTO IV,"Who Tarquin chas’d, Lucretia, Cato’s wife"
656,CANTO IV,"Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;"
657,CANTO IV,"And sole apart retir’d, the Soldan fierce."
658,CANTO IV,
659,CANTO IV,"Then when a little more I rais’d my brow,"
660,CANTO IV,"I spied the master of the sapient throng,"
661,CANTO IV,Seated amid the philosophic train.
662,CANTO IV,"Him all admire, all pay him rev’rence due."
663,CANTO IV,"There Socrates and Plato both I mark’d,"
664,CANTO IV,"Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,"
665,CANTO IV,"Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,"
666,CANTO IV,"With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,"
667,CANTO IV,"And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,"
668,CANTO IV,"Zeno, and Dioscorides well read"
669,CANTO IV,In nature’s secret lore. Orpheus I mark’d
670,CANTO IV,"And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,"
671,CANTO IV,"Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,"
672,CANTO IV,"Galenus, Avicen, and him who made"
673,CANTO IV,"That commentary vast, Averroes."
674,CANTO IV,
675,CANTO IV,Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;
676,CANTO IV,"For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes"
677,CANTO IV,My words fall short of what bechanc’d. In two
678,CANTO IV,The six associates part. Another way
679,CANTO IV,"My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,"
680,CANTO IV,Into a climate ever vex’d with storms:
681,CANTO IV,And to a part I come where no light shines.
682,CANTO IV,
683,CANTO IV,
684,CANTO IV,
685,CANTO IV,
686,CANTO V,CANTO V
687,CANTO V,
688,CANTO V,
689,CANTO V,From the first circle I descended thus
690,CANTO V,"Down to the second, which, a lesser space"
691,CANTO V,"Embracing, so much more of grief contains"
692,CANTO V,"Provoking bitter moans. There, Minos stands"
693,CANTO V,"Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all"
694,CANTO V,"Who enter, strict examining the crimes,"
695,CANTO V,
696,CANTO V,"Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,"
697,CANTO V,According as he foldeth him around:
698,CANTO V,"For when before him comes th’ ill fated soul,"
699,CANTO V,It all confesses; and that judge severe
700,CANTO V,"Of sins, considering what place in hell"
701,CANTO V,"Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft"
702,CANTO V,"Himself encircles, as degrees beneath"
703,CANTO V,He dooms it to descend. Before him stand
704,CANTO V,Always a num’rous throng; and in his turn
705,CANTO V,"Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears"
706,CANTO V,"His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl’d."
707,CANTO V,
708,CANTO V,“O thou! who to this residence of woe
709,CANTO V,"Approachest?” when he saw me coming, cried"
710,CANTO V,"Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,"
711,CANTO V,“Look how thou enter here; beware in whom
712,CANTO V,Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad
713,CANTO V,Deceive thee to thy harm.” To him my guide:
714,CANTO V,“Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way
715,CANTO V,By destiny appointed; so ’tis will’d
716,CANTO V,Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more.”
717,CANTO V,
718,CANTO V,Now ’gin the rueful wailings to be heard.
719,CANTO V,Now am I come where many a plaining voice
720,CANTO V,Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came
721,CANTO V,Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan’d
722,CANTO V,A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
723,CANTO V,By warring winds. The stormy blast of hell
724,CANTO V,With restless fury drives the spirits on
725,CANTO V,Whirl’d round and dash’d amain with sore annoy.
726,CANTO V,
727,CANTO V,"When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,"
728,CANTO V,"There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,"
729,CANTO V,And blasphemies ’gainst the good Power in heaven.
730,CANTO V,
731,CANTO V,I understood that to this torment sad
732,CANTO V,"The carnal sinners are condemn’d, in whom"
733,CANTO V,Reason by lust is sway’d. As in large troops
734,CANTO V,"And multitudinous, when winter reigns,"
735,CANTO V,The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;
736,CANTO V,So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.
737,CANTO V,"On this side and on that, above, below,"
738,CANTO V,It drives them: hope of rest to solace them
739,CANTO V,"Is none, nor e’en of milder pang. As cranes,"
740,CANTO V,"Chanting their dol’rous notes, traverse the sky,"
741,CANTO V,Stretch’d out in long array: so I beheld
742,CANTO V,"Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on"
743,CANTO V,By their dire doom. Then I: “Instructor! who
744,CANTO V,"Are these, by the black air so scourg’d?”—“The first"
745,CANTO V,"’Mong those, of whom thou question’st,” he replied,"
746,CANTO V,“O’er many tongues was empress. She in vice
747,CANTO V,"Of luxury was so shameless, that she made"
748,CANTO V,"Liking be lawful by promulg’d decree,"
749,CANTO V,To clear the blame she had herself incurr’d.
750,CANTO V,"This is Semiramis, of whom ’tis writ,"
751,CANTO V,That she succeeded Ninus her espous’d;
752,CANTO V,"And held the land, which now the Soldan rules."
753,CANTO V,"The next in amorous fury slew herself,"
754,CANTO V,And to Sicheus’ ashes broke her faith:
755,CANTO V,"Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.”"
756,CANTO V,
757,CANTO V,"There mark’d I Helen, for whose sake so long"
758,CANTO V,The time was fraught with evil; there the great
759,CANTO V,"Achilles, who with love fought to the end."
760,CANTO V,"Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside"
761,CANTO V,"A thousand more he show’d me, and by name"
762,CANTO V,"Pointed them out, whom love bereav’d of life."
763,CANTO V,
764,CANTO V,When I had heard my sage instructor name
765,CANTO V,"Those dames and knights of antique days, o’erpower’d"
766,CANTO V,"By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind"
767,CANTO V,Was lost; and I began: “Bard! willingly
768,CANTO V,"I would address those two together coming,"
769,CANTO V,Which seem so light before the wind.” He thus:
770,CANTO V,"“Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.”"
771,CANTO V,
772,CANTO V,"“Then by that love which carries them along,"
773,CANTO V,Entreat; and they will come.” Soon as the wind
774,CANTO V,"Sway’d them toward us, I thus fram’d my speech:"
775,CANTO V,"“O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse"
776,CANTO V,"With us, if by none else restrain’d.” As doves"
777,CANTO V,"By fond desire invited, on wide wings"
778,CANTO V,"And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,"
779,CANTO V,"Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;"
780,CANTO V,"Thus issu’d from that troop, where Dido ranks,"
781,CANTO V,They through the ill air speeding; with such force
782,CANTO V,My cry prevail’d by strong affection urg’d.
783,CANTO V,
784,CANTO V,“O gracious creature and benign! who go’st
785,CANTO V,"Visiting, through this element obscure,"
786,CANTO V,"Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru’d;"
787,CANTO V,"If for a friend the King of all we own’d,"
788,CANTO V,"Our pray’r to him should for thy peace arise,"
789,CANTO V,Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.
790,CANTO V,()f whatsoe’er to hear or to discourse
791,CANTO V,"It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that"
792,CANTO V,"Freely with thee discourse, while e’er the wind,"
793,CANTO V,"As now, is mute. The land, that gave me birth,"
794,CANTO V,"Is situate on the coast, where Po descends"
795,CANTO V,To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.
796,CANTO V,
797,CANTO V,"“Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,"
798,CANTO V,"Entangled him by that fair form, from me"
799,CANTO V,"Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:"
800,CANTO V,"Love, that denial takes from none belov’d,"
801,CANTO V,"Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,"
802,CANTO V,"That, as thou see’st, he yet deserts me not."
803,CANTO V,
804,CANTO V,“Love brought us to one death: Caina waits
805,CANTO V,"The soul, who spilt our life.” Such were their words;"
806,CANTO V,"At hearing which downward I bent my looks,"
807,CANTO V,"And held them there so long, that the bard cried:"
808,CANTO V,“What art thou pond’ring?” I in answer thus:
809,CANTO V,"“Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire"
810,CANTO V,Must they at length to that ill pass have reach’d!”
811,CANTO V,
812,CANTO V,"Then turning, I to them my speech address’d."
813,CANTO V,And thus began: “Francesca! your sad fate
814,CANTO V,Even to tears my grief and pity moves.
815,CANTO V,"But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,"
816,CANTO V,"By what, and how love granted, that ye knew"
817,CANTO V,Your yet uncertain wishes?” She replied:
818,CANTO V,“No greater grief than to remember days
819,CANTO V,"Of joy, when mis’ry is at hand! That kens"
820,CANTO V,Thy learn’d instructor. Yet so eagerly
821,CANTO V,"If thou art bent to know the primal root,"
822,CANTO V,"From whence our love gat being, I will do,"
823,CANTO V,"As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day"
824,CANTO V,"For our delight we read of Lancelot,"
825,CANTO V,"How him love thrall’d. Alone we were, and no"
826,CANTO V,Suspicion near us. Ofttimes by that reading
827,CANTO V,"Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue"
828,CANTO V,Fled from our alter’d cheek. But at one point
829,CANTO V,"Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,"
830,CANTO V,"The wished smile, rapturously kiss’d"
831,CANTO V,"By one so deep in love, then he, who ne’er"
832,CANTO V,"From me shall separate, at once my lips"
833,CANTO V,All trembling kiss’d. The book and writer both
834,CANTO V,Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day
835,CANTO V,"We read no more.” While thus one spirit spake,"
836,CANTO V,"The other wail’d so sorely, that heartstruck"
837,CANTO V,"I through compassion fainting, seem’d not far"
838,CANTO V,"From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground."
839,CANTO V,
840,CANTO V,
841,CANTO V,
842,CANTO V,
843,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
844,CANTO VI,
845,CANTO VI,
846,CANTO VI,"My sense reviving, that erewhile had droop’d"
847,CANTO VI,"With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief"
848,CANTO VI,"O’ercame me wholly, straight around I see"
849,CANTO VI,"New torments, new tormented souls, which way"
850,CANTO VI,"Soe’er I move, or turn, or bend my sight."
851,CANTO VI,"In the third circle I arrive, of show’rs"
852,CANTO VI,"Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang’d"
853,CANTO VI,"For ever, both in kind and in degree."
854,CANTO VI,"Large hail, discolour’d water, sleety flaw"
855,CANTO VI,Through the dun midnight air stream’d down amain:
856,CANTO VI,Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.
857,CANTO VI,
858,CANTO VI,"Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,"
859,CANTO VI,Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
860,CANTO VI,Over the multitude immers’d beneath.
861,CANTO VI,"His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,"
862,CANTO VI,"His belly large, and claw’d the hands, with which"
863,CANTO VI,"He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs"
864,CANTO VI,"Piecemeal disparts. Howling there spread, as curs,"
865,CANTO VI,"Under the rainy deluge, with one side"
866,CANTO VI,"The other screening, oft they roll them round,"
867,CANTO VI,"A wretched, godless crew. When that great worm"
868,CANTO VI,"Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op’d"
869,CANTO VI,"His jaws, and the fangs show’d us; not a limb"
870,CANTO VI,"Of him but trembled. Then my guide, his palms"
871,CANTO VI,"Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth"
872,CANTO VI,"Rais’d them, and cast it in his ravenous maw."
873,CANTO VI,
874,CANTO VI,"E’en as a dog, that yelling bays for food"
875,CANTO VI,"His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall"
876,CANTO VI,"His fury, bent alone with eager haste"
877,CANTO VI,To swallow it; so dropp’d the loathsome cheeks
878,CANTO VI,"Of demon Cerberus, who thund’ring stuns"
879,CANTO VI,"The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain."
880,CANTO VI,
881,CANTO VI,"We, o’er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt"
882,CANTO VI,"Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet"
883,CANTO VI,"Upon their emptiness, that substance seem’d."
884,CANTO VI,
885,CANTO VI,They all along the earth extended lay
886,CANTO VI,"Save one, that sudden rais’d himself to sit,"
887,CANTO VI,Soon as that way he saw us pass. “O thou!”
888,CANTO VI,"He cried, “who through the infernal shades art led,"
889,CANTO VI,"Own, if again thou know’st me. Thou wast fram’d"
890,CANTO VI,Or ere my frame was broken.” I replied:
891,CANTO VI,“The anguish thou endur’st perchance so takes
892,CANTO VI,"Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems"
893,CANTO VI,As if I saw thee never. But inform
894,CANTO VI,"Me who thou art, that in a place so sad"
895,CANTO VI,"Art set, and in such torment, that although"
896,CANTO VI,"Other be greater, more disgustful none"
897,CANTO VI,Can be imagin’d.” He in answer thus:
898,CANTO VI,
899,CANTO VI,"“Thy city heap’d with envy to the brim,"
900,CANTO VI,"Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,"
901,CANTO VI,Held me in brighter days. Ye citizens
902,CANTO VI,Were wont to name me Ciacco. For the sin
903,CANTO VI,"Of glutt’ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,"
904,CANTO VI,"E’en as thou see’st, I with fatigue am worn;"
905,CANTO VI,Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these
906,CANTO VI,Have by like crime incurr’d like punishment.”
907,CANTO VI,
908,CANTO VI,"No more he said, and I my speech resum’d:"
909,CANTO VI,"“Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,"
910,CANTO VI,"Even to tears. But tell me, if thou know’st,"
911,CANTO VI,What shall at length befall the citizens
912,CANTO VI,Of the divided city; whether any just one
913,CANTO VI,"Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,"
914,CANTO VI,Whence jarring discord hath assail’d it thus?”
915,CANTO VI,
916,CANTO VI,He then: “After long striving they will come
917,CANTO VI,To blood; and the wild party from the woods
918,CANTO VI,Will chase the other with much injury forth.
919,CANTO VI,"Then it behoves, that this must fall, within"
920,CANTO VI,Three solar circles; and the other rise
921,CANTO VI,"By borrow’d force of one, who under shore"
922,CANTO VI,Now rests. It shall a long space hold aloof
923,CANTO VI,"Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight"
924,CANTO VI,"The other oppress’d, indignant at the load,"
925,CANTO VI,"And grieving sore. The just are two in number,"
926,CANTO VI,"But they neglected. Av’rice, envy, pride,"
927,CANTO VI,"Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all"
928,CANTO VI,On fire.” Here ceas’d the lamentable sound;
929,CANTO VI,And I continu’d thus: “Still would I learn
930,CANTO VI,"More from thee, farther parley still entreat."
931,CANTO VI,"Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,"
932,CANTO VI,"They who so well deserv’d, of Giacopo,"
933,CANTO VI,"Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent"
934,CANTO VI,Their minds on working good. Oh! tell me where
935,CANTO VI,"They bide, and to their knowledge let me come."
936,CANTO VI,"For I am press’d with keen desire to hear,"
937,CANTO VI,If heaven’s sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
938,CANTO VI,Be to their lip assign’d.” He answer’d straight:
939,CANTO VI,“These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes
940,CANTO VI,Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.
941,CANTO VI,"If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them."
942,CANTO VI,"But to the pleasant world when thou return’st,"
943,CANTO VI,"Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there."
944,CANTO VI,"No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.”"
945,CANTO VI,
946,CANTO VI,"This said, his fixed eyes he turn’d askance,"
947,CANTO VI,"A little ey’d me, then bent down his head,"
948,CANTO VI,And ’midst his blind companions with it fell.
949,CANTO VI,
950,CANTO VI,"When thus my guide: “No more his bed he leaves,"
951,CANTO VI,Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. The Power
952,CANTO VI,"Adverse to these shall then in glory come,"
953,CANTO VI,"Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,"
954,CANTO VI,"Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,"
955,CANTO VI,And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend
956,CANTO VI,The vault.” So pass’d we through that mixture foul
957,CANTO VI,"Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile"
958,CANTO VI,"Touching, though slightly, on the life to come."
959,CANTO VI,"For thus I question’d: “Shall these tortures, Sir!"
960,CANTO VI,"When the great sentence passes, be increas’d,"
961,CANTO VI,"Or mitigated, or as now severe?”"
962,CANTO VI,
963,CANTO VI,He then: “Consult thy knowledge; that decides
964,CANTO VI,"That as each thing to more perfection grows,"
965,CANTO VI,It feels more sensibly both good and pain.
966,CANTO VI,Though ne’er to true perfection may arrive
967,CANTO VI,"This race accurs’d, yet nearer then than now"
968,CANTO VI,They shall approach it.” Compassing that path
969,CANTO VI,"Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse"
970,CANTO VI,Much more than I relate between us pass’d:
971,CANTO VI,"Till at the point, where the steps led below,"
972,CANTO VI,"Arriv’d, there Plutus, the great foe, we found."
973,CANTO VI,
974,CANTO VI,
975,CANTO VI,
976,CANTO VI,
977,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
978,CANTO VII,
979,CANTO VII,
980,CANTO VII,“Ah me! O Satan! Satan!” loud exclaim’d
981,CANTO VII,"Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:"
982,CANTO VII,"And the kind sage, whom no event surpris’d,"
983,CANTO VII,To comfort me thus spake: “Let not thy fear
984,CANTO VII,"Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none"
985,CANTO VII,To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.”
986,CANTO VII,"Then to that sworn lip turning, “Peace!” he cried,"
987,CANTO VII,
988,CANTO VII,“Curs’d wolf! thy fury inward on thyself
989,CANTO VII,"Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound"
990,CANTO VII,Not without cause he passes. So ’t is will’d
991,CANTO VII,"On high, there where the great Archangel pour’d"
992,CANTO VII,Heav’n’s vengeance on the first adulterer proud.”
993,CANTO VII,
994,CANTO VII,As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
995,CANTO VII,"Drop suddenly collaps’d, if the mast split;"
996,CANTO VII,So to the ground down dropp’d the cruel fiend.
997,CANTO VII,
998,CANTO VII,"Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,"
999,CANTO VII,"Gain’d on the dismal shore, that all the woe"
1000,CANTO VII,Hems in of all the universe. Ah me!
1001,CANTO VII,Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap’st
1002,CANTO VII,"New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!"
1003,CANTO VII,Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?
1004,CANTO VII,
1005,CANTO VII,"E’en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,"
1006,CANTO VII,Against encounter’d billow dashing breaks;
1007,CANTO VII,"Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,"
1008,CANTO VII,"Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,"
1009,CANTO VII,"From one side and the other, with loud voice,"
1010,CANTO VII,"Both roll’d on weights by main forge of their breasts,"
1011,CANTO VII,"Then smote together, and each one forthwith"
1012,CANTO VII,"Roll’d them back voluble, turning again,"
1013,CANTO VII,"Exclaiming these, “Why holdest thou so fast?”"
1014,CANTO VII,"Those answering, “And why castest thou away?”"
1015,CANTO VII,"So still repeating their despiteful song,"
1016,CANTO VII,They to the opposite point on either hand
1017,CANTO VII,"Travers’d the horrid circle: then arriv’d,"
1018,CANTO VII,"Both turn’d them round, and through the middle space"
1019,CANTO VII,Conflicting met again. At sight whereof
1020,CANTO VII,"I, stung with grief, thus spake: “O say, my guide!"
1021,CANTO VII,"What race is this? Were these, whose heads are shorn,"
1022,CANTO VII,"On our left hand, all sep’rate to the church?”"
1023,CANTO VII,
1024,CANTO VII,He straight replied: “In their first life these all
1025,CANTO VII,"In mind were so distorted, that they made,"
1026,CANTO VII,"According to due measure, of their wealth,"
1027,CANTO VII,"No use. This clearly from their words collect,"
1028,CANTO VII,"Which they howl forth, at each extremity"
1029,CANTO VII,"Arriving of the circle, where their crime"
1030,CANTO VII,Contrary’ in kind disparts them. To the church
1031,CANTO VII,"Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls"
1032,CANTO VII,"Are crown’d, both Popes and Cardinals, o’er whom"
1033,CANTO VII,Av’rice dominion absolute maintains.”
1034,CANTO VII,
1035,CANTO VII,"I then: “Mid such as these some needs must be,"
1036,CANTO VII,"Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot"
1037,CANTO VII,Of these foul sins were stain’d.” He answering thus:
1038,CANTO VII,"“Vain thought conceiv’st thou. That ignoble life,"
1039,CANTO VII,"Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,"
1040,CANTO VII,And to all knowledge indiscernible.
1041,CANTO VII,Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:
1042,CANTO VII,"These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,"
1043,CANTO VII,"Those with close-shaven locks. That ill they gave,"
1044,CANTO VII,"And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world"
1045,CANTO VII,"Depriv’d, and set them at this strife, which needs"
1046,CANTO VII,No labour’d phrase of mine to set if off.
1047,CANTO VII,"Now may’st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,"
1048,CANTO VII,"The goods committed into fortune’s hands,"
1049,CANTO VII,For which the human race keep such a coil!
1050,CANTO VII,"Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,"
1051,CANTO VII,"Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls"
1052,CANTO VII,Might purchase rest for one.” I thus rejoin’d:
1053,CANTO VII,
1054,CANTO VII,“My guide! of thee this also would I learn;
1055,CANTO VII,"This fortune, that thou speak’st of, what it is,"
1056,CANTO VII,Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?”
1057,CANTO VII,
1058,CANTO VII,He thus: “O beings blind! what ignorance
1059,CANTO VII,Besets you? Now my judgment hear and mark.
1060,CANTO VII,"He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,"
1061,CANTO VII,"The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers"
1062,CANTO VII,"To guide them, so that each part shines to each,"
1063,CANTO VII,Their light in equal distribution pour’d.
1064,CANTO VII,By similar appointment he ordain’d
1065,CANTO VII,Over the world’s bright images to rule.
1066,CANTO VII,Superintendence of a guiding hand
1067,CANTO VII,"And general minister, which at due time"
1068,CANTO VII,May change the empty vantages of life
1069,CANTO VII,"From race to race, from one to other’s blood,"
1070,CANTO VII,Beyond prevention of man’s wisest care:
1071,CANTO VII,"Wherefore one nation rises into sway,"
1072,CANTO VII,"Another languishes, e’en as her will"
1073,CANTO VII,"Decrees, from us conceal’d, as in the grass"
1074,CANTO VII,The serpent train. Against her nought avails
1075,CANTO VII,"Your utmost wisdom. She with foresight plans,"
1076,CANTO VII,"Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs"
1077,CANTO VII,The other powers divine. Her changes know
1078,CANTO VII,Nore intermission: by necessity
1079,CANTO VII,"She is made swift, so frequent come who claim"
1080,CANTO VII,"Succession in her favours. This is she,"
1081,CANTO VII,"So execrated e’en by those, whose debt"
1082,CANTO VII,To her is rather praise; they wrongfully
1083,CANTO VII,"With blame requite her, and with evil word;"
1084,CANTO VII,"But she is blessed, and for that recks not:"
1085,CANTO VII,Amidst the other primal beings glad
1086,CANTO VII,"Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults."
1087,CANTO VII,"Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe"
1088,CANTO VII,"Descending: for each star is falling now,"
1089,CANTO VII,"That mounted at our entrance, and forbids"
1090,CANTO VII,Too long our tarrying.” We the circle cross’d
1091,CANTO VII,"To the next steep, arriving at a well,"
1092,CANTO VII,That boiling pours itself down to a foss
1093,CANTO VII,Sluic’d from its source. Far murkier was the wave
1094,CANTO VII,Than sablest grain: and we in company
1095,CANTO VII,"Of the’ inky waters, journeying by their side,"
1096,CANTO VII,"Enter’d, though by a different track, beneath."
1097,CANTO VII,"Into a lake, the Stygian nam’d, expands"
1098,CANTO VII,"The dismal stream, when it hath reach’d the foot"
1099,CANTO VII,Of the grey wither’d cliffs. Intent I stood
1100,CANTO VII,"To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried"
1101,CANTO VII,"A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks"
1102,CANTO VII,Betok’ning rage. They with their hands alone
1103,CANTO VII,"Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,"
1104,CANTO VII,Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.
1105,CANTO VII,
1106,CANTO VII,"The good instructor spake; “Now seest thou, son!"
1107,CANTO VII,"The souls of those, whom anger overcame."
1108,CANTO VII,"This too for certain know, that underneath"
1109,CANTO VII,"The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs"
1110,CANTO VII,"Into these bubbles make the surface heave,"
1111,CANTO VII,As thine eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turn.”
1112,CANTO VII,Fix’d in the slime they say: “Sad once were we
1113,CANTO VII,"In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,"
1114,CANTO VII,Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:
1115,CANTO VII,Now in these murky settlings are we sad.”
1116,CANTO VII,Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.
1117,CANTO VII,But word distinct can utter none.” Our route
1118,CANTO VII,"Thus compass’d we, a segment widely stretch’d"
1119,CANTO VII,"Between the dry embankment, and the core"
1120,CANTO VII,"Of the loath’d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes"
1121,CANTO VII,Downward on those who gulp’d its muddy lees;
1122,CANTO VII,"Nor stopp’d, till to a tower’s low base we came."
1123,CANTO VII,
1124,CANTO VII,
1125,CANTO VII,
1126,CANTO VII,
1127,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
1128,CANTO VIII,
1129,CANTO VIII,
1130,CANTO VIII,"My theme pursuing, I relate that ere"
1131,CANTO VIII,"We reach’d the lofty turret’s base, our eyes"
1132,CANTO VIII,"Its height ascended, where two cressets hung"
1133,CANTO VIII,"We mark’d, and from afar another light"
1134,CANTO VIII,"Return the signal, so remote, that scarce"
1135,CANTO VIII,The eye could catch its beam. I turning round
1136,CANTO VIII,"To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir’d:"
1137,CANTO VIII,“Say what this means? and what that other light
1138,CANTO VIII,In answer set? what agency doth this?”
1139,CANTO VIII,
1140,CANTO VIII,"“There on the filthy waters,” he replied,"
1141,CANTO VIII,"“E’en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,"
1142,CANTO VIII,If the marsh-gender’d fog conceal it not.”
1143,CANTO VIII,
1144,CANTO VIII,"Never was arrow from the cord dismiss’d,"
1145,CANTO VIII,"That ran its way so nimbly through the air,"
1146,CANTO VIII,"As a small bark, that through the waves I spied"
1147,CANTO VIII,"Toward us coming, under the sole sway"
1148,CANTO VIII,"Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:"
1149,CANTO VIII,"“Art thou arriv’d, fell spirit?”—“Phlegyas, Phlegyas,"
1150,CANTO VIII,"This time thou criest in vain,” my lord replied;"
1151,CANTO VIII,"“No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er"
1152,CANTO VIII,The slimy pool we pass.” As one who hears
1153,CANTO VIII,"Of some great wrong he hath sustain’d, whereat"
1154,CANTO VIII,Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin’d
1155,CANTO VIII,In his fierce ire. My guide descending stepp’d
1156,CANTO VIII,"Into the skiff, and bade me enter next"
1157,CANTO VIII,Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem’d
1158,CANTO VIII,"The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark’d,"
1159,CANTO VIII,"Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,"
1160,CANTO VIII,More deeply than with others it is wont.
1161,CANTO VIII,
1162,CANTO VIII,While we our course o’er the dead channel held.
1163,CANTO VIII,"One drench’d in mire before me came, and said;"
1164,CANTO VIII,"“Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?”"
1165,CANTO VIII,
1166,CANTO VIII,"I answer’d: “Though I come, I tarry not;"
1167,CANTO VIII,"But who art thou, that art become so foul?”"
1168,CANTO VIII,
1169,CANTO VIII,"“One, as thou seest, who mourn:” he straight replied."
1170,CANTO VIII,
1171,CANTO VIII,"To which I thus: “In mourning and in woe,"
1172,CANTO VIII,"Curs’d spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,"
1173,CANTO VIII,E’en thus in filth disguis’d.” Then stretch’d he forth
1174,CANTO VIII,Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage
1175,CANTO VIII,"Aware, thrusting him back: “Away! down there;"
1176,CANTO VIII,
1177,CANTO VIII,"“To the’ other dogs!” then, with his arms my neck"
1178,CANTO VIII,"Encircling, kiss’d my cheek, and spake: “O soul"
1179,CANTO VIII,Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom
1180,CANTO VIII,Thou was conceiv’d! He in the world was one
1181,CANTO VIII,For arrogance noted; to his memory
1182,CANTO VIII,No virtue lends its lustre; even so
1183,CANTO VIII,Here is his shadow furious. There above
1184,CANTO VIII,How many now hold themselves mighty kings
1185,CANTO VIII,"Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,"
1186,CANTO VIII,Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!”
1187,CANTO VIII,
1188,CANTO VIII,I then: “Master! him fain would I behold
1189,CANTO VIII,"Whelm’d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.”"
1190,CANTO VIII,
1191,CANTO VIII,He thus: “Or ever to thy view the shore
1192,CANTO VIII,"Be offer’d, satisfied shall be that wish,"
1193,CANTO VIII,Which well deserves completion.” Scarce his words
1194,CANTO VIII,"Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes"
1195,CANTO VIII,"Set on him with such violence, that yet"
1196,CANTO VIII,For that render I thanks to God and praise
1197,CANTO VIII,“To Filippo Argenti:” cried they all:
1198,CANTO VIII,And on himself the moody Florentine
1199,CANTO VIII,"Turn’d his avenging fangs. Him here we left,"
1200,CANTO VIII,Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear
1201,CANTO VIII,"Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,"
1202,CANTO VIII,Whereat mine eye unbarr’d I sent abroad.
1203,CANTO VIII,
1204,CANTO VIII,"And thus the good instructor: “Now, my son!"
1205,CANTO VIII,"Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam’d,"
1206,CANTO VIII,"With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.”"
1207,CANTO VIII,
1208,CANTO VIII,"I thus: “The minarets already, Sir!"
1209,CANTO VIII,"There certes in the valley I descry,"
1210,CANTO VIII,"Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire"
1211,CANTO VIII,"Had issu’d.” He replied: “Eternal fire,"
1212,CANTO VIII,"That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame"
1213,CANTO VIII,Illum’d; as in this nether hell thou seest.”
1214,CANTO VIII,
1215,CANTO VIII,"We came within the fosses deep, that moat"
1216,CANTO VIII,This region comfortless. The walls appear’d
1217,CANTO VIII,As they were fram’d of iron. We had made
1218,CANTO VIII,"Wide circuit, ere a place we reach’d, where loud"
1219,CANTO VIII,The mariner cried vehement: “Go forth!
1220,CANTO VIII,The’ entrance is here!” Upon the gates I spied
1221,CANTO VIII,"More than a thousand, who of old from heaven"
1222,CANTO VIII,"Were hurl’d. With ireful gestures, “Who is this,”"
1223,CANTO VIII,"They cried, “that without death first felt, goes through"
1224,CANTO VIII,The regions of the dead?” My sapient guide
1225,CANTO VIII,Made sign that he for secret parley wish’d;
1226,CANTO VIII,"Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus"
1227,CANTO VIII,They spake: “Come thou alone; and let him go
1228,CANTO VIII,Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm.
1229,CANTO VIII,Alone return he by his witless way;
1230,CANTO VIII,"If well he know it, let him prove. For thee,"
1231,CANTO VIII,"Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark"
1232,CANTO VIII,"Hast been his escort.” Now bethink thee, reader!"
1233,CANTO VIII,What cheer was mine at sound of those curs’d words.
1234,CANTO VIII,I did believe I never should return.
1235,CANTO VIII,
1236,CANTO VIII,“O my lov’d guide! who more than seven times
1237,CANTO VIII,"Security hast render’d me, and drawn"
1238,CANTO VIII,"From peril deep, whereto I stood expos’d,"
1239,CANTO VIII,"Desert me not,” I cried, “in this extreme."
1240,CANTO VIII,"And if our onward going be denied,"
1241,CANTO VIII,Together trace we back our steps with speed.”
1242,CANTO VIII,
1243,CANTO VIII,"My liege, who thither had conducted me,"
1244,CANTO VIII,Replied: “Fear not: for of our passage none
1245,CANTO VIII,"Hath power to disappoint us, by such high"
1246,CANTO VIII,Authority permitted. But do thou
1247,CANTO VIII,Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
1248,CANTO VIII,"Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur’d"
1249,CANTO VIII,I will not leave thee in this lower world.”
1250,CANTO VIII,
1251,CANTO VIII,"This said, departs the sire benevolent,"
1252,CANTO VIII,And quits me. Hesitating I remain
1253,CANTO VIII,At war ’twixt will and will not in my thoughts.
1254,CANTO VIII,
1255,CANTO VIII,"I could not hear what terms he offer’d them,"
1256,CANTO VIII,"But they conferr’d not long, for all at once"
1257,CANTO VIII,To trial fled within. Clos’d were the gates
1258,CANTO VIII,By those our adversaries on the breast
1259,CANTO VIII,Of my liege lord: excluded he return’d
1260,CANTO VIII,To me with tardy steps. Upon the ground
1261,CANTO VIII,"His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras’d"
1262,CANTO VIII,"All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:"
1263,CANTO VIII,“Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?”
1264,CANTO VIII,"Then thus to me: “That I am anger’d, think"
1265,CANTO VIII,No ground of terror: in this trial I
1266,CANTO VIII,"Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within"
1267,CANTO VIII,"For hindrance. This their insolence, not new,"
1268,CANTO VIII,"Erewhile at gate less secret they display’d,"
1269,CANTO VIII,Which still is without bolt; upon its arch
1270,CANTO VIII,Thou saw’st the deadly scroll: and even now
1271,CANTO VIII,"On this side of its entrance, down the steep,"
1272,CANTO VIII,"Passing the circles, unescorted, comes"
1273,CANTO VIII,One whose strong might can open us this land.”
1274,CANTO VIII,
1275,CANTO VIII,
1276,CANTO VIII,
1277,CANTO VIII,
1278,CANTO IX,CANTO IX
1279,CANTO IX,
1280,CANTO IX,
1281,CANTO IX,"The hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks"
1282,CANTO IX,"Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,"
1283,CANTO IX,"Chas’d that from his which newly they had worn,"
1284,CANTO IX,"And inwardly restrain’d it. He, as one"
1285,CANTO IX,"Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye"
1286,CANTO IX,"Not far could lead him through the sable air,"
1287,CANTO IX,And the thick-gath’ring cloud. “It yet behooves
1288,CANTO IX,We win this fight”—thus he began—“if not—
1289,CANTO IX,"Such aid to us is offer’d.—Oh, how long"
1290,CANTO IX,"Me seems it, ere the promis’d help arrive!”"
1291,CANTO IX,
1292,CANTO IX,"I noted, how the sequel of his words"
1293,CANTO IX,Clok’d their beginning; for the last he spake
1294,CANTO IX,Agreed not with the first. But not the less
1295,CANTO IX,My fear was at his saying; sith I drew
1296,CANTO IX,"To import worse perchance, than that he held,"
1297,CANTO IX,His mutilated speech. “Doth ever any
1298,CANTO IX,Into this rueful concave’s extreme depth
1299,CANTO IX,"Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain"
1300,CANTO IX,Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?”
1301,CANTO IX,
1302,CANTO IX,"Thus I inquiring. “Rarely,” he replied,"
1303,CANTO IX,"“It chances, that among us any makes"
1304,CANTO IX,"This journey, which I wend. Erewhile ’tis true"
1305,CANTO IX,"Once came I here beneath, conjur’d by fell"
1306,CANTO IX,"Erictho, sorceress, who compell’d the shades"
1307,CANTO IX,Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh
1308,CANTO IX,"Was naked of me, when within these walls"
1309,CANTO IX,"She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit"
1310,CANTO IX,From out of Judas’ circle. Lowest place
1311,CANTO IX,"Is that of all, obscurest, and remov’d"
1312,CANTO IX,Farthest from heav’n’s all-circling orb. The road
1313,CANTO IX,Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.
1314,CANTO IX,"That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round"
1315,CANTO IX,"The city’ of grief encompasses, which now"
1316,CANTO IX,We may not enter without rage.” Yet more
1317,CANTO IX,"He added: but I hold it not in mind,"
1318,CANTO IX,For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
1319,CANTO IX,"Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top."
1320,CANTO IX,Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
1321,CANTO IX,At once three hellish furies stain’d with blood:
1322,CANTO IX,In limb and motion feminine they seem’d;
1323,CANTO IX,Around them greenest hydras twisting roll’d
1324,CANTO IX,Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept
1325,CANTO IX,"Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound."
1326,CANTO IX,
1327,CANTO IX,He knowing well the miserable hags
1328,CANTO IX,"Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:"
1329,CANTO IX,
1330,CANTO IX,“Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left
1331,CANTO IX,"This is Megaera; on the right hand she,"
1332,CANTO IX,"Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone"
1333,CANTO IX,"I’ th’ midst.” This said, in silence he remain’d"
1334,CANTO IX,Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves
1335,CANTO IX,"Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais’d,"
1336,CANTO IX,"That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound."
1337,CANTO IX,“Hasten Medusa: so to adamant
1338,CANTO IX,Him shall we change;” all looking down exclaim’d.
1339,CANTO IX,"“E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took"
1340,CANTO IX,"No ill revenge.” “Turn thyself round, and keep"
1341,CANTO IX,Thy count’nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire
1342,CANTO IX,"Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return"
1343,CANTO IX,"Upwards would be for ever lost.” This said,"
1344,CANTO IX,"Himself my gentle master turn’d me round,"
1345,CANTO IX,"Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own"
1346,CANTO IX,He also hid me. Ye of intellect
1347,CANTO IX,"Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal’d"
1348,CANTO IX,Under close texture of the mystic strain!
1349,CANTO IX,
1350,CANTO IX,And now there came o’er the perturbed waves
1351,CANTO IX,"Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made"
1352,CANTO IX,"Either shore tremble, as if of a wind"
1353,CANTO IX,"Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,"
1354,CANTO IX,"That ’gainst some forest driving all its might,"
1355,CANTO IX,"Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls"
1356,CANTO IX,Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps
1357,CANTO IX,"Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly."
1358,CANTO IX,
1359,CANTO IX,"Mine eyes he loos’d, and spake: “And now direct"
1360,CANTO IX,"Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,"
1361,CANTO IX,"There, thickest where the smoke ascends.” As frogs"
1362,CANTO IX,"Before their foe the serpent, through the wave"
1363,CANTO IX,"Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one"
1364,CANTO IX,Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits
1365,CANTO IX,"Destroy’d, so saw I fleeing before one"
1366,CANTO IX,Who pass’d with unwet feet the Stygian sound.
1367,CANTO IX,"He, from his face removing the gross air,"
1368,CANTO IX,"Oft his left hand forth stretch’d, and seem’d alone"
1369,CANTO IX,By that annoyance wearied. I perceiv’d
1370,CANTO IX,"That he was sent from heav’n, and to my guide"
1371,CANTO IX,"Turn’d me, who signal made that I should stand"
1372,CANTO IX,"Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full"
1373,CANTO IX,Of noble anger seem’d he! To the gate
1374,CANTO IX,"He came, and with his wand touch’d it, whereat"
1375,CANTO IX,Open without impediment it flew.
1376,CANTO IX,
1377,CANTO IX,“Outcasts of heav’n! O abject race and scorn’d!”
1378,CANTO IX,"Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,"
1379,CANTO IX,“Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
1380,CANTO IX,Lodge in you? wherefore kick you ’gainst that will
1381,CANTO IX,"Ne’er frustrate of its end, and which so oft"
1382,CANTO IX,Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?
1383,CANTO IX,What profits at the fays to but the horn?
1384,CANTO IX,"Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence"
1385,CANTO IX,"Bears still, peel’d of their hair, his throat and maw.”"
1386,CANTO IX,
1387,CANTO IX,"This said, he turn’d back o’er the filthy way,"
1388,CANTO IX,"And syllable to us spake none, but wore"
1389,CANTO IX,The semblance of a man by other care
1390,CANTO IX,"Beset, and keenly press’d, than thought of him"
1391,CANTO IX,Who in his presence stands. Then we our steps
1392,CANTO IX,"Toward that territory mov’d, secure"
1393,CANTO IX,After the hallow’d words. We unoppos’d
1394,CANTO IX,There enter’d; and my mind eager to learn
1395,CANTO IX,"What state a fortress like to that might hold,"
1396,CANTO IX,"I soon as enter’d throw mine eye around,"
1397,CANTO IX,And see on every part wide-stretching space
1398,CANTO IX,Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.
1399,CANTO IX,
1400,CANTO IX,"As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,"
1401,CANTO IX,"Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro’s gulf,"
1402,CANTO IX,"That closes Italy and laves her bounds,"
1403,CANTO IX,The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;
1404,CANTO IX,"So was it here, save what in horror here"
1405,CANTO IX,"Excell’d: for ’midst the graves were scattered flames,"
1406,CANTO IX,"Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d,"
1407,CANTO IX,That iron for no craft there hotter needs.
1408,CANTO IX,
1409,CANTO IX,"Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath"
1410,CANTO IX,"From them forth issu’d lamentable moans,"
1411,CANTO IX,Such as the sad and tortur’d well might raise.
1412,CANTO IX,
1413,CANTO IX,"I thus: “Master! say who are these, interr’d"
1414,CANTO IX,"Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear"
1415,CANTO IX,The dolorous sighs?” He answer thus return’d:
1416,CANTO IX,
1417,CANTO IX,"“The arch-heretics are here, accompanied"
1418,CANTO IX,"By every sect their followers; and much more,"
1419,CANTO IX,"Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like"
1420,CANTO IX,With like is buried; and the monuments
1421,CANTO IX,"Are different in degrees of heat.” This said,"
1422,CANTO IX,"He to the right hand turning, on we pass’d"
1423,CANTO IX,Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.
1424,CANTO IX,
1425,CANTO IX,
1426,CANTO IX,
1427,CANTO IX,
1428,CANTO X,CANTO X
1429,CANTO X,
1430,CANTO X,
1431,CANTO X,"Now by a secret pathway we proceed,"
1432,CANTO X,"Between the walls, that hem the region round,"
1433,CANTO X,"And the tormented souls: my master first,"
1434,CANTO X,I close behind his steps. “Virtue supreme!”
1435,CANTO X,I thus began; “who through these ample orbs
1436,CANTO X,"In circuit lead’st me, even as thou will’st,"
1437,CANTO X,"Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. May those,"
1438,CANTO X,"Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?"
1439,CANTO X,"Already all the lids are rais’d, and none"
1440,CANTO X,O’er them keeps watch.” He thus in answer spake
1441,CANTO X,"“They shall be closed all, what-time they here"
1442,CANTO X,"From Josaphat return’d shall come, and bring"
1443,CANTO X,"Their bodies, which above they now have left."
1444,CANTO X,The cemetery on this part obtain
1445,CANTO X,"With Epicurus all his followers,"
1446,CANTO X,Who with the body make the spirit die.
1447,CANTO X,Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
1448,CANTO X,"Both to the question ask’d, and to the wish,"
1449,CANTO X,Which thou conceal’st in silence.” I replied:
1450,CANTO X,"“I keep not, guide belov’d! from thee my heart"
1451,CANTO X,"Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,"
1452,CANTO X,A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.”
1453,CANTO X,
1454,CANTO X,“O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire
1455,CANTO X,"Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!"
1456,CANTO X,Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance
1457,CANTO X,Declares the place of thy nativity
1458,CANTO X,"To be that noble land, with which perchance"
1459,CANTO X,I too severely dealt.” Sudden that sound
1460,CANTO X,"Forth issu’d from a vault, whereat in fear"
1461,CANTO X,I somewhat closer to my leader’s side
1462,CANTO X,"Approaching, he thus spake: “What dost thou? Turn."
1463,CANTO X,"Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself"
1464,CANTO X,Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all
1465,CANTO X,Expos’d behold him.” On his face was mine
1466,CANTO X,Already fix’d; his breast and forehead there
1467,CANTO X,"Erecting, seem’d as in high scorn he held"
1468,CANTO X,E’en hell. Between the sepulchres to him
1469,CANTO X,"My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,"
1470,CANTO X,This warning added: “See thy words be clear!”
1471,CANTO X,
1472,CANTO X,"He, soon as there I stood at the tomb’s foot,"
1473,CANTO X,"Ey’d me a space, then in disdainful mood"
1474,CANTO X,"Address’d me: “Say, what ancestors were thine?”"
1475,CANTO X,
1476,CANTO X,"I, willing to obey him, straight reveal’d"
1477,CANTO X,"The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow"
1478,CANTO X,"Somewhat uplifting, cried: “Fiercely were they"
1479,CANTO X,"Adverse to me, my party, and the blood"
1480,CANTO X,From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad
1481,CANTO X,"Scatter’d them.” “Though driv’n out, yet they each time"
1482,CANTO X,"From all parts,” answer’d I, “return’d; an art"
1483,CANTO X,"Which yours have shown, they are not skill’d to learn.”"
1484,CANTO X,
1485,CANTO X,"Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,"
1486,CANTO X,"Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,"
1487,CANTO X,"Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais’d."
1488,CANTO X,"It look’d around, as eager to explore"
1489,CANTO X,If there were other with me; but perceiving
1490,CANTO X,"That fond imagination quench’d, with tears"
1491,CANTO X,Thus spake: “If thou through this blind prison go’st.
1492,CANTO X,"Led by thy lofty genius and profound,"
1493,CANTO X,Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?”
1494,CANTO X,
1495,CANTO X,"I straight replied: “Not of myself I come,"
1496,CANTO X,"By him, who there expects me, through this clime"
1497,CANTO X,"Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son"
1498,CANTO X,Had in contempt.” Already had his words
1499,CANTO X,"And mode of punishment read me his name,"
1500,CANTO X,Whence I so fully answer’d. He at once
1501,CANTO X,"Exclaim’d, up starting, “How! said’st thou he HAD?"
1502,CANTO X,No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye
1503,CANTO X,The blessed daylight?” Then of some delay
1504,CANTO X,"I made ere my reply aware, down fell"
1505,CANTO X,"Supine, not after forth appear’d he more."
1506,CANTO X,
1507,CANTO X,"Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom"
1508,CANTO X,"I yet was station’d, chang’d not count’nance stern,"
1509,CANTO X,"Nor mov’d the neck, nor bent his ribbed side."
1510,CANTO X,"“And if,” continuing the first discourse,"
1511,CANTO X,"“They in this art,” he cried, “small skill have shown,"
1512,CANTO X,That doth torment me more e’en than this bed.
1513,CANTO X,But not yet fifty times shall be relum’d
1514,CANTO X,"Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,"
1515,CANTO X,Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.
1516,CANTO X,"So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,"
1517,CANTO X,"As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,"
1518,CANTO X,Against my kin this people is so fell?”
1519,CANTO X,
1520,CANTO X,"“The slaughter and great havoc,” I replied,"
1521,CANTO X,“That colour’d Arbia’s flood with crimson stain—
1522,CANTO X,"To these impute, that in our hallow’d dome"
1523,CANTO X,Such orisons ascend.” Sighing he shook
1524,CANTO X,"The head, then thus resum’d: “In that affray"
1525,CANTO X,"I stood not singly, nor without just cause"
1526,CANTO X,Assuredly should with the rest have stirr’d;
1527,CANTO X,"But singly there I stood, when by consent"
1528,CANTO X,"Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz’d,"
1529,CANTO X,The one who openly forbad the deed.”
1530,CANTO X,
1531,CANTO X,"“So may thy lineage find at last repose,”"
1532,CANTO X,"I thus adjur’d him, “as thou solve this knot,"
1533,CANTO X,"Which now involves my mind. If right I hear,"
1534,CANTO X,"Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time"
1535,CANTO X,"Leads with him, of the present uninform’d.”"
1536,CANTO X,
1537,CANTO X,"“We view, as one who hath an evil sight,”"
1538,CANTO X,"He answer’d, “plainly, objects far remote:"
1539,CANTO X,So much of his large spendour yet imparts
1540,CANTO X,The’ Almighty Ruler; but when they approach
1541,CANTO X,"Or actually exist, our intellect"
1542,CANTO X,"Then wholly fails, nor of your human state"
1543,CANTO X,Except what others bring us know we aught.
1544,CANTO X,"Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all"
1545,CANTO X,"Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,"
1546,CANTO X,When on futurity the portals close.”
1547,CANTO X,
1548,CANTO X,"Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse"
1549,CANTO X,"Smitten, I added thus: “Now shalt thou say"
1550,CANTO X,"To him there fallen, that his offspring still"
1551,CANTO X,"Is to the living join’d; and bid him know,"
1552,CANTO X,"That if from answer silent I abstain’d,"
1553,CANTO X,’Twas that my thought was occupied intent
1554,CANTO X,"Upon that error, which thy help hath solv’d.”"
1555,CANTO X,
1556,CANTO X,But now my master summoning me back
1557,CANTO X,"I heard, and with more eager haste besought"
1558,CANTO X,"The spirit to inform me, who with him"
1559,CANTO X,Partook his lot. He answer thus return’d:
1560,CANTO X,
1561,CANTO X,“More than a thousand with me here are laid
1562,CANTO X,"Within is Frederick, second of that name,"
1563,CANTO X,"And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest"
1564,CANTO X,"I speak not.” He, this said, from sight withdrew."
1565,CANTO X,But I my steps towards the ancient bard
1566,CANTO X,"Reverting, ruminated on the words"
1567,CANTO X,"Betokening me such ill. Onward he mov’d,"
1568,CANTO X,And thus in going question’d: “Whence the’ amaze
1569,CANTO X,That holds thy senses wrapt?” I satisfied
1570,CANTO X,"The’ inquiry, and the sage enjoin’d me straight:"
1571,CANTO X,“Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
1572,CANTO X,"To thee importing harm; and note thou this,”"
1573,CANTO X,"With his rais’d finger bidding me take heed,"
1574,CANTO X,
1575,CANTO X,"“When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,"
1576,CANTO X,"Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life"
1577,CANTO X,The future tenour will to thee unfold.”
1578,CANTO X,
1579,CANTO X,Forthwith he to the left hand turn’d his feet:
1580,CANTO X,"We left the wall, and tow’rds the middle space"
1581,CANTO X,"Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;"
1582,CANTO X,Which e’en thus high exhal’d its noisome steam.

1587,CANTO XI,CANTO XI
1588,CANTO XI,
1589,CANTO XI,
1590,CANTO XI,"Upon the utmost verge of a high bank,"
1591,CANTO XI,"By craggy rocks environ’d round, we came,"
1592,CANTO XI,Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow’d:
1593,CANTO XI,And here to shun the horrible excess
1594,CANTO XI,"Of fetid exhalation, upward cast"
1595,CANTO XI,"From the profound abyss, behind the lid"
1596,CANTO XI,"Of a great monument we stood retir’d,"
1597,CANTO XI,
1598,CANTO XI,Whereon this scroll I mark’d: “I have in charge
1599,CANTO XI,"Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew"
1600,CANTO XI,From the right path.—Ere our descent behooves
1601,CANTO XI,"We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,"
1602,CANTO XI,"To the dire breath accustom’d, afterward"
1603,CANTO XI,Regard it not.” My master thus; to whom
1604,CANTO XI,Answering I spake: “Some compensation find
1605,CANTO XI,That the time past not wholly lost.” He then:
1606,CANTO XI,“Lo! how my thoughts e’en to thy wishes tend!
1607,CANTO XI,"My son! within these rocks,” he thus began,"
1608,CANTO XI,"“Are three close circles in gradation plac’d,"
1609,CANTO XI,As these which now thou leav’st. Each one is full
1610,CANTO XI,Of spirits accurs’d; but that the sight alone
1611,CANTO XI,"Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how"
1612,CANTO XI,And for what cause in durance they abide.
1613,CANTO XI,
1614,CANTO XI,"“Of all malicious act abhorr’d in heaven,"
1615,CANTO XI,The end is injury; and all such end
1616,CANTO XI,Either by force or fraud works other’s woe
1617,CANTO XI,"But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,"
1618,CANTO XI,To God is more displeasing; and beneath
1619,CANTO XI,The fraudulent are therefore doom’d to’ endure
1620,CANTO XI,Severer pang. The violent occupy
1621,CANTO XI,All the first circle; and because to force
1622,CANTO XI,"Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds"
1623,CANTO XI,Hach within other sep’rate is it fram’d.
1624,CANTO XI,"To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man"
1625,CANTO XI,Force may be offer’d; to himself I say
1626,CANTO XI,"And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear"
1627,CANTO XI,"At full. Death, violent death, and painful wounds"
1628,CANTO XI,Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes
1629,CANTO XI,"By devastation, pillage, and the flames,"
1630,CANTO XI,"His substance. Slayers, and each one that smites"
1631,CANTO XI,"In malice, plund’rers, and all robbers, hence"
1632,CANTO XI,The torment undergo of the first round
1633,CANTO XI,In different herds. Man can do violence
1634,CANTO XI,To himself and his own blessings: and for this
1635,CANTO XI,He in the second round must aye deplore
1636,CANTO XI,"With unavailing penitence his crime,"
1637,CANTO XI,"Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light,"
1638,CANTO XI,"In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,"
1639,CANTO XI,And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.
1640,CANTO XI,"To God may force be offer’d, in the heart"
1641,CANTO XI,"Denying and blaspheming his high power,"
1642,CANTO XI,And nature with her kindly law contemning.
1643,CANTO XI,And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
1644,CANTO XI,"Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak"
1645,CANTO XI,Contemptuously’ of the Godhead in their hearts.
1646,CANTO XI,
1647,CANTO XI,"“Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,"
1648,CANTO XI,"May be by man employ’d on one, whose trust"
1649,CANTO XI,"He wins, or on another who withholds"
1650,CANTO XI,Strict confidence. Seems as the latter way
1651,CANTO XI,Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.
1652,CANTO XI,Whence in the second circle have their nest
1653,CANTO XI,"Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,"
1654,CANTO XI,"Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce"
1655,CANTO XI,"To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,"
1656,CANTO XI,With such vile scum as these. The other way
1657,CANTO XI,"Forgets both Nature’s general love, and that"
1658,CANTO XI,Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
1659,CANTO XI,"To special faith. Whence in the lesser circle,"
1660,CANTO XI,"Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,"
1661,CANTO XI,The traitor is eternally consum’d.”
1662,CANTO XI,
1663,CANTO XI,"I thus: “Instructor, clearly thy discourse"
1664,CANTO XI,"Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm"
1665,CANTO XI,And its inhabitants with skill exact.
1666,CANTO XI,"But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,"
1667,CANTO XI,"Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,"
1668,CANTO XI,"Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,"
1669,CANTO XI,Wherefore within the city fire-illum’d
1670,CANTO XI,"Are not these punish’d, if God’s wrath be on them?"
1671,CANTO XI,"And if it be not, wherefore in such guise"
1672,CANTO XI,Are they condemned?” He answer thus return’d:
1673,CANTO XI,"“Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,"
1674,CANTO XI,Not so accustom’d? or what other thoughts
1675,CANTO XI,Possess it? Dwell not in thy memory
1676,CANTO XI,"The words, wherein thy ethic page describes"
1677,CANTO XI,"Three dispositions adverse to Heav’n’s will,"
1678,CANTO XI,"Incont’nence, malice, and mad brutishness,"
1679,CANTO XI,And how incontinence the least offends
1680,CANTO XI,"God, and least guilt incurs? If well thou note"
1681,CANTO XI,"This judgment, and remember who they are,"
1682,CANTO XI,"Without these walls to vain repentance doom’d,"
1683,CANTO XI,Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac’d
1684,CANTO XI,"From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours"
1685,CANTO XI,Justice divine on them its vengeance down.”
1686,CANTO XI,
1687,CANTO XI,"“O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,"
1688,CANTO XI,"Thou so content’st me, when thou solv’st my doubt,"
1689,CANTO XI,That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.
1690,CANTO XI,"Yet somewhat turn thee back,” I in these words"
1691,CANTO XI,"Continu’d, “where thou saidst, that usury"
1692,CANTO XI,Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot
1693,CANTO XI,Perplex’d unravel.” He thus made reply:
1694,CANTO XI,"“Philosophy, to an attentive ear,"
1695,CANTO XI,"Clearly points out, not in one part alone,"
1696,CANTO XI,How imitative nature takes her course
1697,CANTO XI,From the celestial mind and from its art:
1698,CANTO XI,"And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,"
1699,CANTO XI,"Not many leaves scann’d o’er, observing well"
1700,CANTO XI,"Thou shalt discover, that your art on her"
1701,CANTO XI,"Obsequious follows, as the learner treads"
1702,CANTO XI,"In his instructor’s step, so that your art"
1703,CANTO XI,Deserves the name of second in descent
1704,CANTO XI,"From God. These two, if thou recall to mind"
1705,CANTO XI,"Creation’s holy book, from the beginning"
1706,CANTO XI,Were the right source of life and excellence
1707,CANTO XI,To human kind. But in another path
1708,CANTO XI,The usurer walks; and Nature in herself
1709,CANTO XI,"And in her follower thus he sets at nought,"
1710,CANTO XI,Placing elsewhere his hope. But follow now
1711,CANTO XI,My steps on forward journey bent; for now
1712,CANTO XI,The Pisces play with undulating glance
1713,CANTO XI,"Along the’ horizon, and the Wain lies all"
1714,CANTO XI,O’er the north-west; and onward there a space
1715,CANTO XI,Is our steep passage down the rocky height.”
1716,CANTO XI,
1717,CANTO XI,
1718,CANTO XI,
1719,CANTO XI,
1720,CANTO XII,CANTO XII
1721,CANTO XII,
1722,CANTO XII,
1723,CANTO XII,The place where to descend the precipice
1724,CANTO XII,"We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge"
1725,CANTO XII,"Such object lay, as every eye would shun."
1726,CANTO XII,
1727,CANTO XII,"As is that ruin, which Adice’s stream"
1728,CANTO XII,"On this side Trento struck, should’ring the wave,"
1729,CANTO XII,Or loos’d by earthquake or for lack of prop;
1730,CANTO XII,"For from the mountain’s summit, whence it mov’d"
1731,CANTO XII,"To the low level, so the headlong rock"
1732,CANTO XII,"Is shiver’d, that some passage it might give"
1733,CANTO XII,To him who from above would pass; e’en such
1734,CANTO XII,Into the chasm was that descent: and there
1735,CANTO XII,At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch’d
1736,CANTO XII,"The infamy of Crete, detested brood"
1737,CANTO XII,Of the feign’d heifer: and at sight of us
1738,CANTO XII,"It gnaw’d itself, as one with rage distract."
1739,CANTO XII,
1740,CANTO XII,To him my guide exclaim’d: “Perchance thou deem’st
1741,CANTO XII,"The King of Athens here, who, in the world"
1742,CANTO XII,"Above, thy death contriv’d. Monster! avaunt!"
1743,CANTO XII,"He comes not tutor’d by thy sister’s art,"
1744,CANTO XII,But to behold your torments is he come.”
1745,CANTO XII,
1746,CANTO XII,"Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring"
1747,CANTO XII,"Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow"
1748,CANTO XII,"Hath struck him, but unable to proceed"
1749,CANTO XII,Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge
1750,CANTO XII,The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim’d:
1751,CANTO XII,"“Run to the passage! while he storms, ’t is well"
1752,CANTO XII,That thou descend.” Thus down our road we took
1753,CANTO XII,"Through those dilapidated crags, that oft"
1754,CANTO XII,"Mov’d underneath my feet, to weight like theirs"
1755,CANTO XII,"Unus’d. I pond’ring went, and thus he spake:"
1756,CANTO XII,
1757,CANTO XII,"“Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin’d steep,"
1758,CANTO XII,"Guarded by the brute violence, which I"
1759,CANTO XII,"Have vanquish’d now. Know then, that when I erst"
1760,CANTO XII,"Hither descended to the nether hell,"
1761,CANTO XII,This rock was not yet fallen. But past doubt
1762,CANTO XII,"(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,"
1763,CANTO XII,Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
1764,CANTO XII,"Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds"
1765,CANTO XII,"Such trembling seiz’d the deep concave and foul,"
1766,CANTO XII,"I thought the universe was thrill’d with love,"
1767,CANTO XII,"Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft"
1768,CANTO XII,"Been into chaos turn’d: and in that point,"
1769,CANTO XII,"Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down."
1770,CANTO XII,But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood
1771,CANTO XII,"Approaches, in the which all those are steep’d,"
1772,CANTO XII,Who have by violence injur’d.” O blind lust!
1773,CANTO XII,O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on
1774,CANTO XII,"In the brief life, and in the eternal then"
1775,CANTO XII,Thus miserably o’erwhelm us. I beheld
1776,CANTO XII,"An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,"
1777,CANTO XII,As circling all the plain; for so my guide
1778,CANTO XII,Had told. Between it and the rampart’s base
1779,CANTO XII,"On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm’d,"
1780,CANTO XII,As to the chase they on the earth were wont.
1781,CANTO XII,
1782,CANTO XII,At seeing us descend they each one stood;
1783,CANTO XII,"And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows"
1784,CANTO XII,And missile weapons chosen first; of whom
1785,CANTO XII,One cried from far: “Say to what pain ye come
1786,CANTO XII,"Condemn’d, who down this steep have journied? Speak"
1787,CANTO XII,"From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.”"
1788,CANTO XII,
1789,CANTO XII,To whom my guide: “Our answer shall be made
1790,CANTO XII,"To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come."
1791,CANTO XII,"Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.”"
1792,CANTO XII,
1793,CANTO XII,"Then me he touch’d, and spake: “Nessus is this,"
1794,CANTO XII,"Who for the fair Deianira died,"
1795,CANTO XII,And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.
1796,CANTO XII,"He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,"
1797,CANTO XII,Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs’d;
1798,CANTO XII,"That other Pholus, prone to wrath.” Around"
1799,CANTO XII,"The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts"
1800,CANTO XII,At whatsoever spirit dares emerge
1801,CANTO XII,"From out the blood, more than his guilt allows."
1802,CANTO XII,
1803,CANTO XII,"We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,"
1804,CANTO XII,"Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,"
1805,CANTO XII,And with the notch push’d back his shaggy beard
1806,CANTO XII,"To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view"
1807,CANTO XII,"Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim’d:"
1808,CANTO XII,"“Are ye aware, that he who comes behind"
1809,CANTO XII,Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead
1810,CANTO XII,"Are not so wont.” My trusty guide, who now"
1811,CANTO XII,"Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,"
1812,CANTO XII,"Thus made reply: “He is indeed alive,"
1813,CANTO XII,And solitary so must needs by me
1814,CANTO XII,"Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc’d"
1815,CANTO XII,"By strict necessity, not by delight."
1816,CANTO XII,"She left her joyful harpings in the sky,"
1817,CANTO XII,Who this new office to my care consign’d.
1818,CANTO XII,"He is no robber, no dark spirit I."
1819,CANTO XII,"But by that virtue, which empowers my step"
1820,CANTO XII,"To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,"
1821,CANTO XII,"One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,"
1822,CANTO XII,"Who to the ford may lead us, and convey"
1823,CANTO XII,"Across, him mounted on his back; for he"
1824,CANTO XII,Is not a spirit that may walk the air.”
1825,CANTO XII,
1826,CANTO XII,"Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus"
1827,CANTO XII,"To Nessus spake: “Return, and be their guide."
1828,CANTO XII,"And if ye chance to cross another troop,"
1829,CANTO XII,"Command them keep aloof.” Onward we mov’d,"
1830,CANTO XII,"The faithful escort by our side, along"
1831,CANTO XII,"The border of the crimson-seething flood,"
1832,CANTO XII,Whence from those steep’d within loud shrieks arose.
1833,CANTO XII,
1834,CANTO XII,"Some there I mark’d, as high as to their brow"
1835,CANTO XII,"Immers’d, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:"
1836,CANTO XII,"“These are the souls of tyrants, who were given"
1837,CANTO XII,To blood and rapine. Here they wail aloud
1838,CANTO XII,"Their merciless wrongs. Here Alexander dwells,"
1839,CANTO XII,"And Dionysius fell, who many a year"
1840,CANTO XII,Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. That brow
1841,CANTO XII,"Whereon the hair so jetty clust’ring hangs,"
1842,CANTO XII,Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks
1843,CANTO XII,"Obizzo’ of Este, in the world destroy’d"
1844,CANTO XII,By his foul step-son.” To the bard rever’d
1845,CANTO XII,"I turned me round, and thus he spake; “Let him"
1846,CANTO XII,"Be to thee now first leader, me but next"
1847,CANTO XII,To him in rank.” Then farther on a space
1848,CANTO XII,"The Centaur paus’d, near some, who at the throat"
1849,CANTO XII,Were extant from the wave; and showing us
1850,CANTO XII,"A spirit by itself apart retir’d,"
1851,CANTO XII,"Exclaim’d: “He in God’s bosom smote the heart,"
1852,CANTO XII,Which yet is honour’d on the bank of Thames.”
1853,CANTO XII,
1854,CANTO XII,"A race I next espied, who held the head,"
1855,CANTO XII,And even all the bust above the stream.
1856,CANTO XII,’Midst these I many a face remember’d well.
1857,CANTO XII,"Thus shallow more and more the blood became,"
1858,CANTO XII,So that at last it but imbru’d the feet;
1859,CANTO XII,And there our passage lay athwart the foss.
1860,CANTO XII,
1861,CANTO XII,“As ever on this side the boiling wave
1862,CANTO XII,"Thou seest diminishing,” the Centaur said,"
1863,CANTO XII,"“So on the other, be thou well assur’d,"
1864,CANTO XII,"It lower still and lower sinks its bed,"
1865,CANTO XII,"Till in that part it reuniting join,"
1866,CANTO XII,Where ’t is the lot of tyranny to mourn.
1867,CANTO XII,There Heav’n’s stern justice lays chastising hand
1868,CANTO XII,"On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,"
1869,CANTO XII,"On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts"
1870,CANTO XII,Tears ever by the seething flood unlock’d
1871,CANTO XII,"From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,"
1872,CANTO XII,"Pazzo the other nam’d, who fill’d the ways"
1873,CANTO XII,"With violence and war.” This said, he turn’d,"
1874,CANTO XII,"And quitting us, alone repass’d the ford."
1875,CANTO XII,
1876,CANTO XII,
1877,CANTO XII,
1878,CANTO XII,
1879,CANTO XIII,CANTO XIII
1880,CANTO XIII,
1881,CANTO XIII,
1882,CANTO XIII,"Ere Nessus yet had reach’d the other bank,"
1883,CANTO XIII,"We enter’d on a forest, where no track"
1884,CANTO XIII,Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there
1885,CANTO XIII,"The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light"
1886,CANTO XIII,"The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform’d"
1887,CANTO XIII,"And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns"
1888,CANTO XIII,"Instead, with venom fill’d. Less sharp than these,"
1889,CANTO XIII,"Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide"
1890,CANTO XIII,"Those animals, that hate the cultur’d fields,"
1891,CANTO XIII,Betwixt Corneto and Cecina’s stream.
1892,CANTO XIII,
1893,CANTO XIII,"Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same"
1894,CANTO XIII,Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
1895,CANTO XIII,Drove with dire boding of their future woe.
1896,CANTO XIII,"Broad are their pennons, of the human form"
1897,CANTO XIII,"Their neck and count’nance, arm’d with talons keen"
1898,CANTO XIII,"The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings"
1899,CANTO XIII,These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.
1900,CANTO XIII,
1901,CANTO XIII,The kind instructor in these words began:
1902,CANTO XIII,"“Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now"
1903,CANTO XIII,"I’ th’ second round, and shalt be, till thou come"
1904,CANTO XIII,Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well
1905,CANTO XIII,"Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,"
1906,CANTO XIII,As would my speech discredit.” On all sides
1907,CANTO XIII,"I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see"
1908,CANTO XIII,From whom they might have issu’d. In amaze
1909,CANTO XIII,"Fast bound I stood. He, as it seem’d, believ’d,"
1910,CANTO XIII,That I had thought so many voices came
1911,CANTO XIII,"From some amid those thickets close conceal’d,"
1912,CANTO XIII,And thus his speech resum’d: “If thou lop off
1913,CANTO XIII,"A single twig from one of those ill plants,"
1914,CANTO XIII,The thought thou hast conceiv’d shall vanish quite.”
1915,CANTO XIII,
1916,CANTO XIII,"Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,"
1917,CANTO XIII,"From a great wilding gather’d I a branch,"
1918,CANTO XIII,And straight the trunk exclaim’d: “Why pluck’st thou me?”
1919,CANTO XIII,
1920,CANTO XIII,"Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,"
1921,CANTO XIII,These words it added: “Wherefore tear’st me thus?
1922,CANTO XIII,Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
1923,CANTO XIII,"Men once were we, that now are rooted here."
1924,CANTO XIII,"Thy hand might well have spar’d us, had we been"
1925,CANTO XIII,"The souls of serpents.” As a brand yet green,"
1926,CANTO XIII,That burning at one end from the’ other sends
1927,CANTO XIII,"A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind"
1928,CANTO XIII,"That forces out its way, so burst at once,"
1929,CANTO XIII,Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.
1930,CANTO XIII,
1931,CANTO XIII,"I, letting fall the bough, remain’d as one"
1932,CANTO XIII,"Assail’d by terror, and the sage replied:"
1933,CANTO XIII,"“If he, O injur’d spirit! could have believ’d"
1934,CANTO XIII,"What he hath seen but in my verse describ’d,"
1935,CANTO XIII,He never against thee had stretch’d his hand.
1936,CANTO XIII,"But I, because the thing surpass’d belief,"
1937,CANTO XIII,"Prompted him to this deed, which even now"
1938,CANTO XIII,"Myself I rue. But tell me, who thou wast;"
1939,CANTO XIII,"That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,"
1940,CANTO XIII,In the upper world (for thither to return
1941,CANTO XIII,Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.”
1942,CANTO XIII,
1943,CANTO XIII,"“That pleasant word of thine,” the trunk replied"
1944,CANTO XIII,"“Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech"
1945,CANTO XIII,"Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge"
1946,CANTO XIII,"A little longer, in the snare detain’d,"
1947,CANTO XIII,"Count it not grievous. I it was, who held"
1948,CANTO XIII,"Both keys to Frederick’s heart, and turn’d the wards,"
1949,CANTO XIII,"Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,"
1950,CANTO XIII,"That besides me, into his inmost breast"
1951,CANTO XIII,Scarce any other could admittance find.
1952,CANTO XIII,"The faith I bore to my high charge was such,"
1953,CANTO XIII,It cost me the life-blood that warm’d my veins.
1954,CANTO XIII,"The harlot, who ne’er turn’d her gloating eyes"
1955,CANTO XIII,"From Caesar’s household, common vice and pest"
1956,CANTO XIII,"Of courts, ’gainst me inflam’d the minds of all;"
1957,CANTO XIII,"And to Augustus they so spread the flame,"
1958,CANTO XIII,That my glad honours chang’d to bitter woes.
1959,CANTO XIII,"My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought"
1960,CANTO XIII,"Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,"
1961,CANTO XIII,"Just as I was, unjust toward myself."
1962,CANTO XIII,"By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,"
1963,CANTO XIII,"That never faith I broke to my liege lord,"
1964,CANTO XIII,"Who merited such honour; and of you,"
1965,CANTO XIII,"If any to the world indeed return,"
1966,CANTO XIII,"Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies"
1967,CANTO XIII,Yet prostrate under envy’s cruel blow.”
1968,CANTO XIII,
1969,CANTO XIII,"First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words"
1970,CANTO XIII,"Were ended, then to me the bard began:"
1971,CANTO XIII,"“Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,"
1972,CANTO XIII,If more thou wish to learn.” Whence I replied:
1973,CANTO XIII,“Question thou him again of whatsoe’er
1974,CANTO XIII,"Will, as thou think’st, content me; for no power"
1975,CANTO XIII,"Have I to ask, such pity’ is at my heart.”"
1976,CANTO XIII,
1977,CANTO XIII,He thus resum’d; “So may he do for thee
1978,CANTO XIII,"Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet"
1979,CANTO XIII,"Be pleas’d, imprison’d Spirit! to declare,"
1980,CANTO XIII,How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;
1981,CANTO XIII,And whether any ever from such frame
1982,CANTO XIII,"Be loosen’d, if thou canst, that also tell.”"
1983,CANTO XIII,
1984,CANTO XIII,"Thereat the trunk breath’d hard, and the wind soon"
1985,CANTO XIII,Chang’d into sounds articulate like these;
1986,CANTO XIII,
1987,CANTO XIII,“Briefly ye shall be answer’d. When departs
1988,CANTO XIII,"The fierce soul from the body, by itself"
1989,CANTO XIII,"Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf"
1990,CANTO XIII,"By Minos doom’d, into the wood it falls,"
1991,CANTO XIII,"No place assign’d, but wheresoever chance"
1992,CANTO XIII,"Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,"
1993,CANTO XIII,"It rises to a sapling, growing thence"
1994,CANTO XIII,"A savage plant. The Harpies, on its leaves"
1995,CANTO XIII,"Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain"
1996,CANTO XIII,"A vent to grief. We, as the rest, shall come"
1997,CANTO XIII,"For our own spoils, yet not so that with them"
1998,CANTO XIII,We may again be clad; for what a man
1999,CANTO XIII,Takes from himself it is not just he have.
2000,CANTO XIII,Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout
2001,CANTO XIII,"The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,"
2002,CANTO XIII,Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.”
2003,CANTO XIII,
2004,CANTO XIII,Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
2005,CANTO XIII,"We stood, expecting farther speech, when us"
2006,CANTO XIII,"A noise surpris’d, as when a man perceives"
2007,CANTO XIII,The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
2008,CANTO XIII,"Of station’d watch, who of the beasts and boughs"
2009,CANTO XIII,Loud rustling round him hears. And lo! there came
2010,CANTO XIII,"Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,"
2011,CANTO XIII,That they before them broke each fan o’ th’ wood.
2012,CANTO XIII,"“Haste now,” the foremost cried, “now haste thee death!”"
2013,CANTO XIII,
2014,CANTO XIII,"The’ other, as seem’d, impatient of delay"
2015,CANTO XIII,"Exclaiming, “Lano! not so bent for speed"
2016,CANTO XIII,"Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo’s field.”"
2017,CANTO XIII,"And then, for that perchance no longer breath"
2018,CANTO XIII,"Suffic’d him, of himself and of a bush"
2019,CANTO XIII,One group he made. Behind them was the wood
2020,CANTO XIII,"Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,"
2021,CANTO XIII,As greyhounds that have newly slipp’d the leash.
2022,CANTO XIII,"On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,"
2023,CANTO XIII,And having rent him piecemeal bore away
2024,CANTO XIII,"The tortur’d limbs. My guide then seiz’d my hand,"
2025,CANTO XIII,"And led me to the thicket, which in vain"
2026,CANTO XIII,Mourn’d through its bleeding wounds: “O Giacomo
2027,CANTO XIII,"Of Sant’ Andrea! what avails it thee,”"
2028,CANTO XIII,"It cried, “that of me thou hast made thy screen?"
2029,CANTO XIII,For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?”
2030,CANTO XIII,
2031,CANTO XIII,"When o’er it he had paus’d, my master spake:"
2032,CANTO XIII,"“Say who wast thou, that at so many points"
2033,CANTO XIII,Breath’st out with blood thy lamentable speech?”
2034,CANTO XIII,
2035,CANTO XIII,"He answer’d: “Oh, ye spirits: arriv’d in time"
2036,CANTO XIII,"To spy the shameful havoc, that from me"
2037,CANTO XIII,"My leaves hath sever’d thus, gather them up,"
2038,CANTO XIII,And at the foot of their sad parent-tree
2039,CANTO XIII,"Carefully lay them. In that city’ I dwelt,"
2040,CANTO XIII,"Who for the Baptist her first patron chang’d,"
2041,CANTO XIII,Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
2042,CANTO XIII,To work her woe: and if there still remain’d not
2043,CANTO XIII,"On Arno’s passage some faint glimpse of him,"
2044,CANTO XIII,"Those citizens, who rear’d once more her walls"
2045,CANTO XIII,"Upon the ashes left by Attila,"
2046,CANTO XIII,Had labour’d without profit of their toil.
2047,CANTO XIII,I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.”
2048,CANTO XIII,
2049,CANTO XIII,
2050,CANTO XIII,
2051,CANTO XIII,
2052,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
2053,CANTO XIV,
2054,CANTO XIV,
2055,CANTO XIV,Soon as the charity of native land
2056,CANTO XIV,"Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter’d leaves"
2057,CANTO XIV,"Collected, and to him restor’d, who now"
2058,CANTO XIV,Was hoarse with utt’rance. To the limit thence
2059,CANTO XIV,"We came, which from the third the second round"
2060,CANTO XIV,"Divides, and where of justice is display’d"
2061,CANTO XIV,Contrivance horrible. Things then first seen
2062,CANTO XIV,"Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next"
2063,CANTO XIV,"A plain we reach’d, that from its sterile bed"
2064,CANTO XIV,Each plant repell’d. The mournful wood waves round
2065,CANTO XIV,"Its garland on all sides, as round the wood"
2066,CANTO XIV,"Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge,"
2067,CANTO XIV,Our steps we stay’d. It was an area wide
2068,CANTO XIV,"Of arid sand and thick, resembling most"
2069,CANTO XIV,The soil that erst by Cato’s foot was trod.
2070,CANTO XIV,
2071,CANTO XIV,Vengeance of Heav’n! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear’d
2072,CANTO XIV,"By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!"
2073,CANTO XIV,
2074,CANTO XIV,"Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,"
2075,CANTO XIV,"All weeping piteously, to different laws"
2076,CANTO XIV,"Subjected: for on the’ earth some lay supine,"
2077,CANTO XIV,"Some crouching close were seated, others pac’d"
2078,CANTO XIV,"Incessantly around; the latter tribe,"
2079,CANTO XIV,"More numerous, those fewer who beneath"
2080,CANTO XIV,"The torment lay, but louder in their grief."
2081,CANTO XIV,
2082,CANTO XIV,O’er all the sand fell slowly wafting down
2083,CANTO XIV,"Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow"
2084,CANTO XIV,"On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush’d."
2085,CANTO XIV,"As in the torrid Indian clime, the son"
2086,CANTO XIV,Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
2087,CANTO XIV,"Descending, solid flames, that to the ground"
2088,CANTO XIV,Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop
2089,CANTO XIV,To trample on the soil; for easier thus
2090,CANTO XIV,"The vapour was extinguish’d, while alone;"
2091,CANTO XIV,"So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith"
2092,CANTO XIV,"The marble glow’d underneath, as under stove"
2093,CANTO XIV,"The viands, doubly to augment the pain."
2094,CANTO XIV,
2095,CANTO XIV,"Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,"
2096,CANTO XIV,"Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off"
2097,CANTO XIV,"The heat, still falling fresh. I thus began:"
2098,CANTO XIV,"“Instructor! thou who all things overcom’st,"
2099,CANTO XIV,"Except the hardy demons, that rush’d forth"
2100,CANTO XIV,"To stop our entrance at the gate, say who"
2101,CANTO XIV,"Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not"
2102,CANTO XIV,"The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,"
2103,CANTO XIV,As by the sultry tempest immatur’d?”
2104,CANTO XIV,
2105,CANTO XIV,"Straight he himself, who was aware I ask’d"
2106,CANTO XIV,"My guide of him, exclaim’d: “Such as I was"
2107,CANTO XIV,"When living, dead such now I am. If Jove"
2108,CANTO XIV,"Weary his workman out, from whom in ire"
2109,CANTO XIV,"He snatch’d the lightnings, that at my last day"
2110,CANTO XIV,"Transfix’d me, if the rest be weary out"
2111,CANTO XIV,At their black smithy labouring by turns
2112,CANTO XIV,"In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;"
2113,CANTO XIV,"“Help, help, good Mulciber!” as erst he cried"
2114,CANTO XIV,"In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts"
2115,CANTO XIV,"Launch he full aim’d at me with all his might,"
2116,CANTO XIV,He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.”
2117,CANTO XIV,
2118,CANTO XIV,"Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais’d"
2119,CANTO XIV,Than I before had heard him: “Capaneus!
2120,CANTO XIV,"Thou art more punish’d, in that this thy pride"
2121,CANTO XIV,"Lives yet unquench’d: no torrent, save thy rage,"
2122,CANTO XIV,Were to thy fury pain proportion’d full.”
2123,CANTO XIV,
2124,CANTO XIV,Next turning round to me with milder lip
2125,CANTO XIV,"He spake: “This of the seven kings was one,"
2126,CANTO XIV,"Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,"
2127,CANTO XIV,"As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,"
2128,CANTO XIV,And sets his high omnipotence at nought.
2129,CANTO XIV,"But, as I told him, his despiteful mood"
2130,CANTO XIV,Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.
2131,CANTO XIV,Follow me now; and look thou set not yet
2132,CANTO XIV,"Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood"
2133,CANTO XIV,Keep ever close.” Silently on we pass’d
2134,CANTO XIV,To where there gushes from the forest’s bound
2135,CANTO XIV,"A little brook, whose crimson’d wave yet lifts"
2136,CANTO XIV,"My hair with horror. As the rill, that runs"
2137,CANTO XIV,"From Bulicame, to be portion’d out"
2138,CANTO XIV,Among the sinful women; so ran this
2139,CANTO XIV,"Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank"
2140,CANTO XIV,"Stone-built, and either margin at its side,"
2141,CANTO XIV,Whereon I straight perceiv’d our passage lay.
2142,CANTO XIV,
2143,CANTO XIV,"“Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate"
2144,CANTO XIV,"We enter’d first, whose threshold is to none"
2145,CANTO XIV,"Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,"
2146,CANTO XIV,"As is this river, has thine eye discern’d,"
2147,CANTO XIV,O’er which the flaming volley all is quench’d.”
2148,CANTO XIV,
2149,CANTO XIV,"So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,"
2150,CANTO XIV,"That having giv’n me appetite to know,"
2151,CANTO XIV,"The food he too would give, that hunger crav’d."
2152,CANTO XIV,
2153,CANTO XIV,"“In midst of ocean,” forthwith he began,"
2154,CANTO XIV,"“A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam’d,"
2155,CANTO XIV,Under whose monarch in old times the world
2156,CANTO XIV,"Liv’d pure and chaste. A mountain rises there,"
2157,CANTO XIV,"Call’d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,"
2158,CANTO XIV,Deserted now like a forbidden thing.
2159,CANTO XIV,"It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn’s spouse,"
2160,CANTO XIV,Chose for the secret cradle of her son;
2161,CANTO XIV,"And better to conceal him, drown’d in shouts"
2162,CANTO XIV,"His infant cries. Within the mount, upright"
2163,CANTO XIV,"An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns"
2164,CANTO XIV,"His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome"
2165,CANTO XIV,As in his mirror looks. Of finest gold
2166,CANTO XIV,"His head is shap’d, pure silver are the breast"
2167,CANTO XIV,And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.
2168,CANTO XIV,"And downward all beneath well-temper’d steel,"
2169,CANTO XIV,"Save the right foot of potter’s clay, on which"
2170,CANTO XIV,"Than on the other more erect he stands,"
2171,CANTO XIV,"Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;"
2172,CANTO XIV,"And from the fissure tears distil, which join’d"
2173,CANTO XIV,Penetrate to that cave. They in their course
2174,CANTO XIV,Thus far precipitated down the rock
2175,CANTO XIV,"Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;"
2176,CANTO XIV,Then by this straiten’d channel passing hence
2177,CANTO XIV,"Beneath, e’en to the lowest depth of all,"
2178,CANTO XIV,"Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself"
2179,CANTO XIV,Shall see it) I here give thee no account.”
2180,CANTO XIV,
2181,CANTO XIV,Then I to him: “If from our world this sluice
2182,CANTO XIV,Be thus deriv’d; wherefore to us but now
2183,CANTO XIV,Appears it at this edge?” He straight replied:
2184,CANTO XIV,"“The place, thou know’st, is round; and though great part"
2185,CANTO XIV,"Thou have already pass’d, still to the left"
2186,CANTO XIV,"Descending to the nethermost, not yet"
2187,CANTO XIV,Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.
2188,CANTO XIV,"Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,"
2189,CANTO XIV,It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.”
2190,CANTO XIV,
2191,CANTO XIV,Then I again inquir’d: “Where flow the streams
2192,CANTO XIV,Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one
2193,CANTO XIV,"Thou tell’st not, and the other of that shower,"
2194,CANTO XIV,"Thou say’st, is form’d.” He answer thus return’d:"
2195,CANTO XIV,“Doubtless thy questions all well pleas’d I hear.
2196,CANTO XIV,Yet the red seething wave might have resolv’d
2197,CANTO XIV,"One thou proposest. Lethe thou shalt see,"
2198,CANTO XIV,"But not within this hollow, in the place,"
2199,CANTO XIV,"Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,"
2200,CANTO XIV,Whose blame hath been by penitence remov’d.”
2201,CANTO XIV,He added: “Time is now we quit the wood.
2202,CANTO XIV,Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give
2203,CANTO XIV,"Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;"
2204,CANTO XIV,For over them all vapour is extinct.”
2205,CANTO XIV,
2206,CANTO XIV,
2207,CANTO XIV,
2208,CANTO XIV,
2209,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
2210,CANTO XV,
2211,CANTO XV,
2212,CANTO XV,One of the solid margins bears us now
2213,CANTO XV,"Envelop’d in the mist, that from the stream"
2214,CANTO XV,"Arising, hovers o’er, and saves from fire"
2215,CANTO XV,Both piers and water. As the Flemings rear
2216,CANTO XV,"Their mound, ’twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back"
2217,CANTO XV,"The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide"
2218,CANTO XV,"That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs"
2219,CANTO XV,"Along the Brenta, to defend their towns"
2220,CANTO XV,"And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt"
2221,CANTO XV,"On Chiarentana’s top; such were the mounds,"
2222,CANTO XV,"So fram’d, though not in height or bulk to these"
2223,CANTO XV,"Made equal, by the master, whosoe’er"
2224,CANTO XV,"He was, that rais’d them here. We from the wood"
2225,CANTO XV,"Were not so far remov’d, that turning round"
2226,CANTO XV,"I might not have discern’d it, when we met"
2227,CANTO XV,"A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier."
2228,CANTO XV,
2229,CANTO XV,"They each one ey’d us, as at eventide"
2230,CANTO XV,"One eyes another under a new moon,"
2231,CANTO XV,"And toward us sharpen’d their sight as keen,"
2232,CANTO XV,As an old tailor at his needle’s eye.
2233,CANTO XV,
2234,CANTO XV,"Thus narrowly explor’d by all the tribe,"
2235,CANTO XV,"I was agniz’d of one, who by the skirt"
2236,CANTO XV,"Caught me, and cried, “What wonder have we here!”"
2237,CANTO XV,
2238,CANTO XV,"And I, when he to me outstretch’d his arm,"
2239,CANTO XV,"Intently fix’d my ken on his parch’d looks,"
2240,CANTO XV,"That although smirch’d with fire, they hinder’d not"
2241,CANTO XV,But I remember’d him; and towards his face
2242,CANTO XV,"My hand inclining, answer’d: “Sir! Brunetto!"
2243,CANTO XV,
2244,CANTO XV,“And art thou here?” He thus to me: “My son!
2245,CANTO XV,"Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto"
2246,CANTO XV,Latini but a little space with thee
2247,CANTO XV,"Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.”"
2248,CANTO XV,
2249,CANTO XV,"I thus to him replied: “Much as I can,"
2250,CANTO XV,"I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,"
2251,CANTO XV,"That I here seat me with thee, I consent;"
2252,CANTO XV,"His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain’d.”"
2253,CANTO XV,
2254,CANTO XV,"“O son!” said he, “whoever of this throng"
2255,CANTO XV,"One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,"
2256,CANTO XV,"No fan to ventilate him, when the fire"
2257,CANTO XV,Smites sorest. Pass thou therefore on. I close
2258,CANTO XV,"Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin"
2259,CANTO XV,"My troop, who go mourning their endless doom.”"
2260,CANTO XV,
2261,CANTO XV,I dar’d not from the path descend to tread
2262,CANTO XV,"On equal ground with him, but held my head"
2263,CANTO XV,"Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise."
2264,CANTO XV,
2265,CANTO XV,"“What chance or destiny,” thus he began,"
2266,CANTO XV,“Ere the last day conducts thee here below?
2267,CANTO XV,"And who is this, that shows to thee the way?”"
2268,CANTO XV,
2269,CANTO XV,"“There up aloft,” I answer’d, “in the life"
2270,CANTO XV,"Serene, I wander’d in a valley lost,"
2271,CANTO XV,Before mine age had to its fullness reach’d.
2272,CANTO XV,But yester-morn I left it: then once more
2273,CANTO XV,"Into that vale returning, him I met;"
2274,CANTO XV,And by this path homeward he leads me back.”
2275,CANTO XV,
2276,CANTO XV,"“If thou,” he answer’d, “follow but thy star,"
2277,CANTO XV,Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:
2278,CANTO XV,Unless in fairer days my judgment err’d.
2279,CANTO XV,"And if my fate so early had not chanc’d,"
2280,CANTO XV,"Seeing the heav’ns thus bounteous to thee, I"
2281,CANTO XV,Had gladly giv’n thee comfort in thy work.
2282,CANTO XV,"But that ungrateful and malignant race,"
2283,CANTO XV,"Who in old times came down from Fesole,"
2284,CANTO XV,"Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,"
2285,CANTO XV,Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.
2286,CANTO XV,Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour’d crabs
2287,CANTO XV,It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.
2288,CANTO XV,"Old fame reports them in the world for blind,"
2289,CANTO XV,"Covetous, envious, proud. Look to it well:"
2290,CANTO XV,Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways. For thee
2291,CANTO XV,"Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,"
2292,CANTO XV,That thou by either party shalt be crav’d
2293,CANTO XV,With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far
2294,CANTO XV,From the goat’s tooth. The herd of Fesole
2295,CANTO XV,"May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,"
2296,CANTO XV,"If any such yet spring on their rank bed,"
2297,CANTO XV,"In which the holy seed revives, transmitted"
2298,CANTO XV,"From those true Romans, who still there remain’d,"
2299,CANTO XV,When it was made the nest of so much ill.”
2300,CANTO XV,
2301,CANTO XV,"“Were all my wish fulfill’d,” I straight replied,"
2302,CANTO XV,“Thou from the confines of man’s nature yet
2303,CANTO XV,Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind
2304,CANTO XV,"Is fix’d, and now strikes full upon my heart"
2305,CANTO XV,"The dear, benign, paternal image, such"
2306,CANTO XV,"As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me"
2307,CANTO XV,The way for man to win eternity;
2308,CANTO XV,"And how I priz’d the lesson, it behooves,"
2309,CANTO XV,"That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,"
2310,CANTO XV,"What of my fate thou tell’st, that write I down:"
2311,CANTO XV,And with another text to comment on
2312,CANTO XV,"For her I keep it, the celestial dame,"
2313,CANTO XV,"Who will know all, if I to her arrive."
2314,CANTO XV,This only would I have thee clearly note:
2315,CANTO XV,That so my conscience have no plea against me;
2316,CANTO XV,"Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar’d."
2317,CANTO XV,Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.
2318,CANTO XV,"Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,"
2319,CANTO XV,The clown his mattock; all things have their course.”
2320,CANTO XV,
2321,CANTO XV,Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
2322,CANTO XV,"Turn’d himself back, then look’d at me and spake:"
2323,CANTO XV,“He listens to good purpose who takes note.”
2324,CANTO XV,
2325,CANTO XV,"I not the less still on my way proceed,"
2326,CANTO XV,"Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire"
2327,CANTO XV,Who are most known and chief among his tribe.
2328,CANTO XV,
2329,CANTO XV,"“To know of some is well;” thus he replied,"
2330,CANTO XV,“But of the rest silence may best beseem.
2331,CANTO XV,Time would not serve us for report so long.
2332,CANTO XV,"In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,"
2333,CANTO XV,"Men of great learning and no less renown,"
2334,CANTO XV,By one same sin polluted in the world.
2335,CANTO XV,"With them is Priscian, and Accorso’s son"
2336,CANTO XV,Francesco herds among that wretched throng:
2337,CANTO XV,"And, if the wish of so impure a blotch"
2338,CANTO XV,"Possess’d thee, him thou also might’st have seen,"
2339,CANTO XV,Who by the servants’ servant was transferr’d
2340,CANTO XV,"From Arno’s seat to Bacchiglione, where"
2341,CANTO XV,"His ill-strain’d nerves he left. I more would add,"
2342,CANTO XV,But must from farther speech and onward way
2343,CANTO XV,"Alike desist, for yonder I behold"
2344,CANTO XV,A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.
2345,CANTO XV,"A company, with whom I may not sort,"
2346,CANTO XV,"Approaches. I commend my TREASURE to thee,"
2347,CANTO XV,Wherein I yet survive; my sole request.”
2348,CANTO XV,
2349,CANTO XV,"This said he turn’d, and seem’d as one of those,"
2350,CANTO XV,Who o’er Verona’s champain try their speed
2351,CANTO XV,"For the green mantle, and of them he seem’d,"
2352,CANTO XV,Not he who loses but who gains the prize.
2353,CANTO XV,
2354,CANTO XV,
2355,CANTO XV,
2356,CANTO XV,
2357,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
2358,CANTO XVI,
2359,CANTO XVI,
2360,CANTO XVI,"Now came I where the water’s din was heard,"
2361,CANTO XVI,"As down it fell into the other round,"
2362,CANTO XVI,Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:
2363,CANTO XVI,"When forth together issu’d from a troop,"
2364,CANTO XVI,"That pass’d beneath the fierce tormenting storm,"
2365,CANTO XVI,"Three spirits, running swift. They towards us came,"
2366,CANTO XVI,"And each one cried aloud, “Oh do thou stay!"
2367,CANTO XVI,Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
2368,CANTO XVI,To be some inmate of our evil land.”
2369,CANTO XVI,
2370,CANTO XVI,"Ah me! what wounds I mark’d upon their limbs,"
2371,CANTO XVI,"Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!"
2372,CANTO XVI,E’en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.
2373,CANTO XVI,
2374,CANTO XVI,"Attentive to their cry my teacher paus’d,"
2375,CANTO XVI,"And turn’d to me his visage, and then spake;"
2376,CANTO XVI,“Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:
2377,CANTO XVI,"And were ’t not for the nature of the place,"
2378,CANTO XVI,"Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,"
2379,CANTO XVI,That haste had better suited thee than them.”
2380,CANTO XVI,
2381,CANTO XVI,"They, when we stopp’d, resum’d their ancient wail,"
2382,CANTO XVI,"And soon as they had reach’d us, all the three"
2383,CANTO XVI,Whirl’d round together in one restless wheel.
2384,CANTO XVI,"As naked champions, smear’d with slippery oil,"
2385,CANTO XVI,Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
2386,CANTO XVI,"And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;"
2387,CANTO XVI,"Thus each one, as he wheel’d, his countenance"
2388,CANTO XVI,"At me directed, so that opposite"
2389,CANTO XVI,The neck mov’d ever to the twinkling feet.
2390,CANTO XVI,
2391,CANTO XVI,"“If misery of this drear wilderness,”"
2392,CANTO XVI,"Thus one began, “added to our sad cheer"
2393,CANTO XVI,"And destitute, do call forth scorn on us"
2394,CANTO XVI,"And our entreaties, let our great renown"
2395,CANTO XVI,"Incline thee to inform us who thou art,"
2396,CANTO XVI,That dost imprint with living feet unharm’d
2397,CANTO XVI,"The soil of Hell. He, in whose track thou see’st"
2398,CANTO XVI,"My steps pursuing, naked though he be"
2399,CANTO XVI,"And reft of all, was of more high estate"
2400,CANTO XVI,Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste
2401,CANTO XVI,"Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call’d,"
2402,CANTO XVI,Who in his lifetime many a noble act
2403,CANTO XVI,"Achiev’d, both by his wisdom and his sword."
2404,CANTO XVI,"The other, next to me that beats the sand,"
2405,CANTO XVI,"Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,"
2406,CANTO XVI,"In the’ upper world, of honour; and myself"
2407,CANTO XVI,"Who in this torment do partake with them,"
2408,CANTO XVI,"Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife"
2409,CANTO XVI,"Of savage temper, more than aught beside"
2410,CANTO XVI,Hath to this evil brought.” If from the fire
2411,CANTO XVI,"I had been shelter’d, down amidst them straight"
2412,CANTO XVI,"I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,"
2413,CANTO XVI,Would have restrain’d my going; but that fear
2414,CANTO XVI,"Of the dire burning vanquish’d the desire,"
2415,CANTO XVI,Which made me eager of their wish’d embrace.
2416,CANTO XVI,
2417,CANTO XVI,"I then began: “Not scorn, but grief much more,"
2418,CANTO XVI,"Such as long time alone can cure, your doom"
2419,CANTO XVI,"Fix’d deep within me, soon as this my lord"
2420,CANTO XVI,"Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect"
2421,CANTO XVI,"That such a race, as ye are, was at hand."
2422,CANTO XVI,"I am a countryman of yours, who still"
2423,CANTO XVI,"Affectionate have utter’d, and have heard"
2424,CANTO XVI,Your deeds and names renown’d. Leaving the gall
2425,CANTO XVI,"For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide"
2426,CANTO XVI,"Hath promis’d to me. But behooves, that far"
2427,CANTO XVI,As to the centre first I downward tend.”
2428,CANTO XVI,
2429,CANTO XVI,"“So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,”"
2430,CANTO XVI,He answer straight return’d; “and so thy fame
2431,CANTO XVI,"Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,"
2432,CANTO XVI,"If courtesy and valour, as they wont,"
2433,CANTO XVI,"Dwell in our city, or have vanish’d clean?"
2434,CANTO XVI,"For one amidst us late condemn’d to wail,"
2435,CANTO XVI,"Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,"
2436,CANTO XVI,Grieves us no little by the news he brings.”
2437,CANTO XVI,
2438,CANTO XVI,"“An upstart multitude and sudden gains,"
2439,CANTO XVI,"Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee"
2440,CANTO XVI,"Engender’d, so that now in tears thou mourn’st!”"
2441,CANTO XVI,"Thus cried I with my face uprais’d, and they"
2442,CANTO XVI,"All three, who for an answer took my words,"
2443,CANTO XVI,"Look’d at each other, as men look when truth"
2444,CANTO XVI,"Comes to their ear. “If thou at other times,”"
2445,CANTO XVI,"They all at once rejoin’d, “so easily"
2446,CANTO XVI,"Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,"
2447,CANTO XVI,"Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!"
2448,CANTO XVI,"Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,"
2449,CANTO XVI,"Returning to behold the radiant stars,"
2450,CANTO XVI,"When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,"
2451,CANTO XVI,See that of us thou speak among mankind.”
2452,CANTO XVI,
2453,CANTO XVI,"This said, they broke the circle, and so swift"
2454,CANTO XVI,"Fled, that as pinions seem’d their nimble feet."
2455,CANTO XVI,
2456,CANTO XVI,Not in so short a time might one have said
2457,CANTO XVI,"“Amen,” as they had vanish’d. Straight my guide"
2458,CANTO XVI,Pursu’d his track. I follow’d; and small space
2459,CANTO XVI,"Had we pass’d onward, when the water’s sound"
2460,CANTO XVI,"Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce"
2461,CANTO XVI,Heard one another’s speech for the loud din.
2462,CANTO XVI,
2463,CANTO XVI,"E’en as the river, that holds on its course"
2464,CANTO XVI,"Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,"
2465,CANTO XVI,"On the left side of Apennine, toward"
2466,CANTO XVI,"The east, which Acquacheta higher up"
2467,CANTO XVI,"They call, ere it descend into the vale,"
2468,CANTO XVI,"At Forli by that name no longer known,"
2469,CANTO XVI,"Rebellows o’er Saint Benedict, roll’d on"
2470,CANTO XVI,"From the’ Alpine summit down a precipice,"
2471,CANTO XVI,Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;
2472,CANTO XVI,"Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,"
2473,CANTO XVI,"That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,"
2474,CANTO XVI,So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn’d.
2475,CANTO XVI,
2476,CANTO XVI,"I had a cord that brac’d my girdle round,"
2477,CANTO XVI,Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
2478,CANTO XVI,The painted leopard. This when I had all
2479,CANTO XVI,Unloosen’d from me (so my master bade)
2480,CANTO XVI,"I gather’d up, and stretch’d it forth to him."
2481,CANTO XVI,"Then to the right he turn’d, and from the brink"
2482,CANTO XVI,"Standing few paces distant, cast it down"
2483,CANTO XVI,"Into the deep abyss. “And somewhat strange,”"
2484,CANTO XVI,"Thus to myself I spake, “signal so strange"
2485,CANTO XVI,"Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye"
2486,CANTO XVI,Thus follows.” Ah! what caution must men use
2487,CANTO XVI,"With those who look not at the deed alone,"
2488,CANTO XVI,But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!
2489,CANTO XVI,
2490,CANTO XVI,"“Quickly shall come,” he said, “what I expect,"
2491,CANTO XVI,"Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof"
2492,CANTO XVI,"Thy thought is dreaming.” Ever to that truth,"
2493,CANTO XVI,"Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,"
2494,CANTO XVI,"A man, if possible, should bar his lip;"
2495,CANTO XVI,"Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach."
2496,CANTO XVI,But silence here were vain; and by these notes
2497,CANTO XVI,"Which now I sing, reader! I swear to thee,"
2498,CANTO XVI,So may they favour find to latest times!
2499,CANTO XVI,That through the gross and murky air I spied
2500,CANTO XVI,"A shape come swimming up, that might have quell’d"
2501,CANTO XVI,"The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise"
2502,CANTO XVI,"As one returns, who hath been down to loose"
2503,CANTO XVI,"An anchor grappled fast against some rock,"
2504,CANTO XVI,"Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,"
2505,CANTO XVI,Who upward springing close draws in his feet.
2506,CANTO XVI,
2507,CANTO XVI,
2508,CANTO XVI,
2509,CANTO XVI,
2510,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
2511,CANTO XVII,
2512,CANTO XVII,
2513,CANTO XVII,“Lo! the fell monster with the deadly sting!
2514,CANTO XVII,"Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls"
2515,CANTO XVII,"And firm embattled spears, and with his filth"
2516,CANTO XVII,"Taints all the world!” Thus me my guide address’d,"
2517,CANTO XVII,"And beckon’d him, that he should come to shore,"
2518,CANTO XVII,Near to the stony causeway’s utmost edge.
2519,CANTO XVII,
2520,CANTO XVII,"Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear’d,"
2521,CANTO XVII,"His head and upper part expos’d on land,"
2522,CANTO XVII,But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
2523,CANTO XVII,"His face the semblance of a just man’s wore,"
2524,CANTO XVII,So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
2525,CANTO XVII,The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
2526,CANTO XVII,"Reach’d to the armpits, and the back and breast,"
2527,CANTO XVII,"And either side, were painted o’er with nodes"
2528,CANTO XVII,And orbits. Colours variegated more
2529,CANTO XVII,Nor Turks nor Tartars e’er on cloth of state
2530,CANTO XVII,"With interchangeable embroidery wove,"
2531,CANTO XVII,Nor spread Arachne o’er her curious loom.
2532,CANTO XVII,"As ofttimes a light skiff, moor’d to the shore,"
2533,CANTO XVII,"Stands part in water, part upon the land;"
2534,CANTO XVII,"Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,"
2535,CANTO XVII,The beaver settles watching for his prey;
2536,CANTO XVII,"So on the rim, that fenc’d the sand with rock,"
2537,CANTO XVII,Sat perch’d the fiend of evil. In the void
2538,CANTO XVII,"Glancing, his tail upturn’d its venomous fork,"
2539,CANTO XVII,With sting like scorpion’s arm’d. Then thus my guide:
2540,CANTO XVII,"“Now need our way must turn few steps apart,"
2541,CANTO XVII,"Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.”"
2542,CANTO XVII,
2543,CANTO XVII,Thereat toward the right our downward course
2544,CANTO XVII,"We shap’d, and, better to escape the flame"
2545,CANTO XVII,"And burning marle, ten paces on the verge"
2546,CANTO XVII,"Proceeded. Soon as we to him arrive,"
2547,CANTO XVII,A little further on mine eye beholds
2548,CANTO XVII,"A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand"
2549,CANTO XVII,Near the wide chasm. Forthwith my master spake:
2550,CANTO XVII,“That to the full thy knowledge may extend
2551,CANTO XVII,"Of all this round contains, go now, and mark"
2552,CANTO XVII,The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.
2553,CANTO XVII,"Till thou returnest, I with him meantime"
2554,CANTO XVII,"Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe"
2555,CANTO XVII,The aid of his strong shoulders.” Thus alone
2556,CANTO XVII,Yet forward on the’ extremity I pac’d
2557,CANTO XVII,"Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe"
2558,CANTO XVII,Were seated. At the eyes forth gush’d their pangs.
2559,CANTO XVII,Against the vapours and the torrid soil
2560,CANTO XVII,Alternately their shifting hands they plied.
2561,CANTO XVII,Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
2562,CANTO XVII,"Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore"
2563,CANTO XVII,"By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round."
2564,CANTO XVII,
2565,CANTO XVII,"Noting the visages of some, who lay"
2566,CANTO XVII,"Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,"
2567,CANTO XVII,"One of them all I knew not; but perceiv’d,"
2568,CANTO XVII,That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
2569,CANTO XVII,"With colours and with emblems various mark’d,"
2570,CANTO XVII,On which it seem’d as if their eye did feed.
2571,CANTO XVII,
2572,CANTO XVII,"And when amongst them looking round I came,"
2573,CANTO XVII,"A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,"
2574,CANTO XVII,That wore a lion’s countenance and port.
2575,CANTO XVII,"Then still my sight pursuing its career,"
2576,CANTO XVII,"Another I beheld, than blood more red."
2577,CANTO XVII,A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
2578,CANTO XVII,"And one, who bore a fat and azure swine"
2579,CANTO XVII,"Pictur’d on his white scrip, addressed me thus:"
2580,CANTO XVII,"“What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know,"
2581,CANTO XVII,"Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here"
2582,CANTO XVII,Vitaliano on my left shall sit.
2583,CANTO XVII,A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
2584,CANTO XVII,"Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming"
2585,CANTO XVII,‘O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch
2586,CANTO XVII,"With the three beaks will bring!’” This said, he writh’d"
2587,CANTO XVII,"The mouth, and loll’d the tongue out, like an ox"
2588,CANTO XVII,"That licks his nostrils. I, lest longer stay"
2589,CANTO XVII,"He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,"
2590,CANTO XVII,Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn’d.
2591,CANTO XVII,
2592,CANTO XVII,My guide already seated on the haunch
2593,CANTO XVII,Of the fierce animal I found; and thus
2594,CANTO XVII,He me encourag’d. “Be thou stout; be bold.
2595,CANTO XVII,Down such a steep flight must we now descend!
2596,CANTO XVII,Mount thou before: for that no power the tail
2597,CANTO XVII,"May have to harm thee, I will be i’ th’ midst.”"
2598,CANTO XVII,
2599,CANTO XVII,"As one, who hath an ague fit so near,"
2600,CANTO XVII,"His nails already are turn’d blue, and he"
2601,CANTO XVII,"Quivers all o’er, if he but eye the shade;"
2602,CANTO XVII,Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.
2603,CANTO XVII,"But shame soon interpos’d her threat, who makes"
2604,CANTO XVII,The servant bold in presence of his lord.
2605,CANTO XVII,
2606,CANTO XVII,"I settled me upon those shoulders huge,"
2607,CANTO XVII,"And would have said, but that the words to aid"
2608,CANTO XVII,"My purpose came not, “Look thou clasp me firm!”"
2609,CANTO XVII,
2610,CANTO XVII,"But he whose succour then not first I prov’d,"
2611,CANTO XVII,"Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,"
2612,CANTO XVII,"Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:"
2613,CANTO XVII,“Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres
2614,CANTO XVII,"Of ample circuit, easy thy descent."
2615,CANTO XVII,Think on th’ unusual burden thou sustain’st.”
2616,CANTO XVII,
2617,CANTO XVII,"As a small vessel, back’ning out from land,"
2618,CANTO XVII,"Her station quits; so thence the monster loos’d,"
2619,CANTO XVII,"And when he felt himself at large, turn’d round"
2620,CANTO XVII,"There where the breast had been, his forked tail."
2621,CANTO XVII,"Thus, like an eel, outstretch’d at length he steer’d,"
2622,CANTO XVII,Gath’ring the air up with retractile claws.
2623,CANTO XVII,
2624,CANTO XVII,Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
2625,CANTO XVII,"The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,"
2626,CANTO XVII,"Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;"
2627,CANTO XVII,"Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv’d,"
2628,CANTO XVII,"By liquefaction of the scalded wax,"
2629,CANTO XVII,"The trusted pennons loosen’d from his loins,"
2630,CANTO XVII,"His sire exclaiming loud, “Ill way thou keep’st!”"
2631,CANTO XVII,"Than was my dread, when round me on each part"
2632,CANTO XVII,"The air I view’d, and other object none"
2633,CANTO XVII,"Save the fell beast. He slowly sailing, wheels"
2634,CANTO XVII,"His downward motion, unobserv’d of me,"
2635,CANTO XVII,"But that the wind, arising to my face,"
2636,CANTO XVII,Breathes on me from below. Now on our right
2637,CANTO XVII,I heard the cataract beneath us leap
2638,CANTO XVII,"With hideous crash; whence bending down to’ explore,"
2639,CANTO XVII,New terror I conceiv’d at the steep plunge:
2640,CANTO XVII,
2641,CANTO XVII,"For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:"
2642,CANTO XVII,"So that all trembling close I crouch’d my limbs,"
2643,CANTO XVII,"And then distinguish’d, unperceiv’d before,"
2644,CANTO XVII,By the dread torments that on every side
2645,CANTO XVII,"Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound."
2646,CANTO XVII,
2647,CANTO XVII,"As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,"
2648,CANTO XVII,"But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair"
2649,CANTO XVII,"The falconer cries, “Ah me! thou stoop’st to earth!”"
2650,CANTO XVII,"Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky"
2651,CANTO XVII,"In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits"
2652,CANTO XVII,At distance from his lord in angry mood;
2653,CANTO XVII,So Geryon lighting places us on foot
2654,CANTO XVII,"Low down at base of the deep-furrow’d rock,"
2655,CANTO XVII,"And, of his burden there discharg’d, forthwith"
2656,CANTO XVII,"Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string."
2657,CANTO XVII,
2658,CANTO XVII,
2659,CANTO XVII,
2660,CANTO XVII,
2661,CANTO XVIII,CANTO XVIII
2662,CANTO XVIII,
2663,CANTO XVIII,
2664,CANTO XVIII,There is a place within the depths of hell
2665,CANTO XVIII,"Call’d Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain’d"
2666,CANTO XVIII,"With hue ferruginous, e’en as the steep"
2667,CANTO XVIII,That round it circling winds. Right in the midst
2668,CANTO XVIII,"Of that abominable region, yawns"
2669,CANTO XVIII,"A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame"
2670,CANTO XVIII,"Due time shall tell. The circle, that remains,"
2671,CANTO XVIII,"Throughout its round, between the gulf and base"
2672,CANTO XVIII,"Of the high craggy banks, successive forms"
2673,CANTO XVIII,"Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk."
2674,CANTO XVIII,
2675,CANTO XVIII,"As where to guard the walls, full many a foss"
2676,CANTO XVIII,"Begirds some stately castle, sure defence"
2677,CANTO XVIII,"Affording to the space within, so here"
2678,CANTO XVIII,Were model’d these; and as like fortresses
2679,CANTO XVIII,"E’en from their threshold to the brink without,"
2680,CANTO XVIII,Are flank’d with bridges; from the rock’s low base
2681,CANTO XVIII,"Thus flinty paths advanc’d, that ’cross the moles"
2682,CANTO XVIII,"And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,"
2683,CANTO XVIII,That in one bound collected cuts them off.
2684,CANTO XVIII,"Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves"
2685,CANTO XVIII,From Geryon’s back dislodg’d. The bard to left
2686,CANTO XVIII,"Held on his way, and I behind him mov’d."
2687,CANTO XVIII,
2688,CANTO XVIII,"On our right hand new misery I saw,"
2689,CANTO XVIII,"New pains, new executioners of wrath,"
2690,CANTO XVIII,That swarming peopled the first chasm. Below
2691,CANTO XVIII,"Were naked sinners. Hitherward they came,"
2692,CANTO XVIII,"Meeting our faces from the middle point,"
2693,CANTO XVIII,With us beyond but with a larger stride.
2694,CANTO XVIII,"E’en thus the Romans, when the year returns"
2695,CANTO XVIII,"Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid"
2696,CANTO XVIII,"The thronging multitudes, their means devise"
2697,CANTO XVIII,For such as pass the bridge; that on one side
2698,CANTO XVIII,"All front toward the castle, and approach"
2699,CANTO XVIII,"Saint Peter’s fane, on th’ other towards the mount."
2700,CANTO XVIII,
2701,CANTO XVIII,"Each divers way along the grisly rock,"
2702,CANTO XVIII,"Horn’d demons I beheld, with lashes huge,"
2703,CANTO XVIII,That on their back unmercifully smote.
2704,CANTO XVIII,Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!
2705,CANTO XVIII,
2706,CANTO XVIII,None for the second waited nor the third.
2707,CANTO XVIII,
2708,CANTO XVIII,"Meantime as on I pass’d, one met my sight"
2709,CANTO XVIII,"Whom soon as view’d; “Of him,” cried I, “not yet"
2710,CANTO XVIII,Mine eye hath had his fill.” With fixed gaze
2711,CANTO XVIII,I therefore scann’d him. Straight the teacher kind
2712,CANTO XVIII,"Paus’d with me, and consented I should walk"
2713,CANTO XVIII,"Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,"
2714,CANTO XVIII,"Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down."
2715,CANTO XVIII,But it avail’d him nought; for I exclaim’d:
2716,CANTO XVIII,"“Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,"
2717,CANTO XVIII,"Unless thy features do belie thee much,"
2718,CANTO XVIII,Venedico art thou. But what brings thee
2719,CANTO XVIII,Into this bitter seas’ning?” He replied:
2720,CANTO XVIII,“Unwillingly I answer to thy words.
2721,CANTO XVIII,"But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls"
2722,CANTO XVIII,"The world I once inhabited, constrains me."
2723,CANTO XVIII,Know then ’twas I who led fair Ghisola
2724,CANTO XVIII,"To do the Marquis’ will, however fame"
2725,CANTO XVIII,The shameful tale have bruited. Nor alone
2726,CANTO XVIII,Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
2727,CANTO XVIII,Rather with us the place is so o’erthrong’d
2728,CANTO XVIII,"That not so many tongues this day are taught,"
2729,CANTO XVIII,"Betwixt the Reno and Savena’s stream,"
2730,CANTO XVIII,To answer SIPA in their country’s phrase.
2731,CANTO XVIII,"And if of that securer proof thou need,"
2732,CANTO XVIII,Remember but our craving thirst for gold.”
2733,CANTO XVIII,
2734,CANTO XVIII,"Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong"
2735,CANTO XVIII,"Struck, and exclaim’d, “Away! corrupter! here"
2736,CANTO XVIII,Women are none for sale.” Forthwith I join’d
2737,CANTO XVIII,"My escort, and few paces thence we came"
2738,CANTO XVIII,To where a rock forth issued from the bank.
2739,CANTO XVIII,"That easily ascended, to the right"
2740,CANTO XVIII,"Upon its splinter turning, we depart"
2741,CANTO XVIII,"From those eternal barriers. When arriv’d,"
2742,CANTO XVIII,Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
2743,CANTO XVIII,"The scourged souls: “Pause here,” the teacher said,"
2744,CANTO XVIII,"“And let these others miserable, now"
2745,CANTO XVIII,"Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,"
2746,CANTO XVIII,For that together they with us have walk’d.”
2747,CANTO XVIII,
2748,CANTO XVIII,"From the old bridge we ey’d the pack, who came"
2749,CANTO XVIII,"From th’ other side towards us, like the rest,"
2750,CANTO XVIII,"Excoriate from the lash. My gentle guide,"
2751,CANTO XVIII,"By me unquestion’d, thus his speech resum’d:"
2752,CANTO XVIII,"“Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,"
2753,CANTO XVIII,And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.
2754,CANTO XVIII,How yet the regal aspect he retains!
2755,CANTO XVIII,"Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won"
2756,CANTO XVIII,The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle
2757,CANTO XVIII,"His passage thither led him, when those bold"
2758,CANTO XVIII,And pitiless women had slain all their males.
2759,CANTO XVIII,There he with tokens and fair witching words
2760,CANTO XVIII,"Hypsipyle beguil’d, a virgin young,"
2761,CANTO XVIII,Who first had all the rest herself beguil’d.
2762,CANTO XVIII,Impregnated he left her there forlorn.
2763,CANTO XVIII,Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.
2764,CANTO XVIII,Here too Medea’s inj’ries are avenged.
2765,CANTO XVIII,"All bear him company, who like deceit"
2766,CANTO XVIII,To his have practis’d. And thus much to know
2767,CANTO XVIII,"Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those"
2768,CANTO XVIII,Whom its keen torments urge.” Now had we come
2769,CANTO XVIII,"Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten’d path"
2770,CANTO XVIII,Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.
2771,CANTO XVIII,
2772,CANTO XVIII,"Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,"
2773,CANTO XVIII,"Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,"
2774,CANTO XVIII,"With wide-stretch’d nostrils snort, and on themselves"
2775,CANTO XVIII,Smite with their palms. Upon the banks a scurf
2776,CANTO XVIII,"From the foul steam condens’d, encrusting hung,"
2777,CANTO XVIII,That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
2778,CANTO XVIII,
2779,CANTO XVIII,"So hollow is the depth, that from no part,"
2780,CANTO XVIII,"Save on the summit of the rocky span,"
2781,CANTO XVIII,Could I distinguish aught. Thus far we came;
2782,CANTO XVIII,"And thence I saw, within the foss below,"
2783,CANTO XVIII,"A crowd immers’d in ordure, that appear’d"
2784,CANTO XVIII,Draff of the human body. There beneath
2785,CANTO XVIII,"Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark’d"
2786,CANTO XVIII,"One with his head so grim’d, ’t were hard to deem,"
2787,CANTO XVIII,If he were clerk or layman. Loud he cried:
2788,CANTO XVIII,"“Why greedily thus bendest more on me,"
2789,CANTO XVIII,"Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?”"
2790,CANTO XVIII,
2791,CANTO XVIII,"“Because if true my mem’ry,” I replied,"
2792,CANTO XVIII,"“I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,"
2793,CANTO XVIII,And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.
2794,CANTO XVIII,Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.”
2795,CANTO XVIII,
2796,CANTO XVIII,Then beating on his brain these words he spake:
2797,CANTO XVIII,"“Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,"
2798,CANTO XVIII,Wherewith I ne’er enough could glut my tongue.”
2799,CANTO XVIII,
2800,CANTO XVIII,My leader thus: “A little further stretch
2801,CANTO XVIII,"Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note"
2802,CANTO XVIII,"Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,"
2803,CANTO XVIII,"Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,"
2804,CANTO XVIII,"Now crouching down, now risen on her feet."
2805,CANTO XVIII,
2806,CANTO XVIII,"“Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip"
2807,CANTO XVIII,"Answer’d her doting paramour that ask’d,"
2808,CANTO XVIII,"‘Thankest me much!’—‘Say rather wondrously,’"
2809,CANTO XVIII,And seeing this here satiate be our view.”
2810,CANTO XVIII,
2811,CANTO XVIII,
2812,CANTO XVIII,
2813,CANTO XVIII,
2814,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
2815,CANTO XIX,
2816,CANTO XIX,
2817,CANTO XIX,"Woe to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,"
2818,CANTO XIX,"His wretched followers! who the things of God,"
2819,CANTO XIX,"Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,"
2820,CANTO XIX,"Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute"
2821,CANTO XIX,For gold and silver in adultery!
2822,CANTO XIX,"Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours"
2823,CANTO XIX,Is the third chasm. Upon the following vault
2824,CANTO XIX,"We now had mounted, where the rock impends"
2825,CANTO XIX,Directly o’er the centre of the foss.
2826,CANTO XIX,
2827,CANTO XIX,"Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,"
2828,CANTO XIX,"Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,"
2829,CANTO XIX,"And in the evil world, how just a meed"
2830,CANTO XIX,Allotting by thy virtue unto all!
2831,CANTO XIX,
2832,CANTO XIX,"I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides"
2833,CANTO XIX,"And in its bottom full of apertures,"
2834,CANTO XIX,"All equal in their width, and circular each,"
2835,CANTO XIX,Nor ample less nor larger they appear’d
2836,CANTO XIX,Than in Saint John’s fair dome of me belov’d
2837,CANTO XIX,"Those fram’d to hold the pure baptismal streams,"
2838,CANTO XIX,"One of the which I brake, some few years past,"
2839,CANTO XIX,To save a whelming infant; and be this
2840,CANTO XIX,A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
2841,CANTO XIX,The motive of my deed. From out the mouth
2842,CANTO XIX,"Of every one, emerg’d a sinner’s feet"
2843,CANTO XIX,And of the legs high upward as the calf
2844,CANTO XIX,The rest beneath was hid. On either foot
2845,CANTO XIX,"The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints"
2846,CANTO XIX,"Glanc’d with such violent motion, as had snapt"
2847,CANTO XIX,"Asunder cords or twisted withs. As flame,"
2848,CANTO XIX,"Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along"
2849,CANTO XIX,"The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;"
2850,CANTO XIX,"So here, from heel to point, glided the flames."
2851,CANTO XIX,
2852,CANTO XIX,"“Master! say who is he, than all the rest"
2853,CANTO XIX,"Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom"
2854,CANTO XIX,A ruddier flame doth prey?” I thus inquir’d.
2855,CANTO XIX,
2856,CANTO XIX,"“If thou be willing,” he replied, “that I"
2857,CANTO XIX,"Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,"
2858,CANTO XIX,He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.”
2859,CANTO XIX,
2860,CANTO XIX,I then: “As pleases thee to me is best.
2861,CANTO XIX,Thou art my lord; and know’st that ne’er I quit
2862,CANTO XIX,Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.”
2863,CANTO XIX,"Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn’d,"
2864,CANTO XIX,"And on our left descended to the depth,"
2865,CANTO XIX,A narrow strait and perforated close.
2866,CANTO XIX,"Nor from his side my leader set me down,"
2867,CANTO XIX,"Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb"
2868,CANTO XIX,"Quiv’ring express’d his pang. “Whoe’er thou art,"
2869,CANTO XIX,"Sad spirit! thus revers’d, and as a stake"
2870,CANTO XIX,"Driv’n in the soil!” I in these words began,"
2871,CANTO XIX,"“If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.”"
2872,CANTO XIX,
2873,CANTO XIX,"There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive"
2874,CANTO XIX,"A wretch for murder doom’d, who e’en when fix’d,"
2875,CANTO XIX,"Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays."
2876,CANTO XIX,
2877,CANTO XIX,He shouted: “Ha! already standest there?
2878,CANTO XIX,"Already standest there, O Boniface!"
2879,CANTO XIX,By many a year the writing play’d me false.
2880,CANTO XIX,"So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,"
2881,CANTO XIX,For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
2882,CANTO XIX,"The lovely lady, and then mangle her?”"
2883,CANTO XIX,
2884,CANTO XIX,"I felt as those who, piercing not the drift"
2885,CANTO XIX,"Of answer made them, stand as if expos’d"
2886,CANTO XIX,"In mockery, nor know what to reply,"
2887,CANTO XIX,"When Virgil thus admonish’d: “Tell him quick,"
2888,CANTO XIX,"I am not he, not he, whom thou believ’st.”"
2889,CANTO XIX,
2890,CANTO XIX,"And I, as was enjoin’d me, straight replied."
2891,CANTO XIX,
2892,CANTO XIX,"That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,"
2893,CANTO XIX,And sighing next in woeful accent spake:
2894,CANTO XIX,“What then of me requirest? If to know
2895,CANTO XIX,"So much imports thee, who I am, that thou"
2896,CANTO XIX,"Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn"
2897,CANTO XIX,"That in the mighty mantle I was rob’d,"
2898,CANTO XIX,"And of a she-bear was indeed the son,"
2899,CANTO XIX,"So eager to advance my whelps, that there"
2900,CANTO XIX,"My having in my purse above I stow’d,"
2901,CANTO XIX,And here myself. Under my head are dragg’d
2902,CANTO XIX,"The rest, my predecessors in the guilt"
2903,CANTO XIX,Of simony. Stretch’d at their length they lie
2904,CANTO XIX,Along an opening in the rock. ’Midst them
2905,CANTO XIX,"I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,"
2906,CANTO XIX,"For whom I took thee, when so hastily"
2907,CANTO XIX,I question’d. But already longer time
2908,CANTO XIX,"Hath pass’d, since my souls kindled, and I thus"
2909,CANTO XIX,"Upturn’d have stood, than is his doom to stand"
2910,CANTO XIX,"Planted with fiery feet. For after him,"
2911,CANTO XIX,"One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,"
2912,CANTO XIX,"From forth the west, a shepherd without law,"
2913,CANTO XIX,Fated to cover both his form and mine.
2914,CANTO XIX,"He a new Jason shall be call’d, of whom"
2915,CANTO XIX,In Maccabees we read; and favour such
2916,CANTO XIX,"As to that priest his king indulgent show’d,"
2917,CANTO XIX,Shall be of France’s monarch shown to him.”
2918,CANTO XIX,
2919,CANTO XIX,"I know not if I here too far presum’d,"
2920,CANTO XIX,"But in this strain I answer’d: “Tell me now,"
2921,CANTO XIX,What treasures from St. Peter at the first
2922,CANTO XIX,"Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys"
2923,CANTO XIX,Into his charge? Surely he ask’d no more
2924,CANTO XIX,"But, Follow me! Nor Peter nor the rest"
2925,CANTO XIX,"Or gold or silver of Matthias took,"
2926,CANTO XIX,When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
2927,CANTO XIX,Of the condemned soul. Abide thou then;
2928,CANTO XIX,Thy punishment of right is merited:
2929,CANTO XIX,"And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,"
2930,CANTO XIX,Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir’d.
2931,CANTO XIX,"If reverence of the keys restrain’d me not,"
2932,CANTO XIX,"Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet"
2933,CANTO XIX,Severer speech might use. Your avarice
2934,CANTO XIX,"O’ercasts the world with mourning, under foot"
2935,CANTO XIX,"Treading the good, and raising bad men up."
2936,CANTO XIX,"Of shepherds, like to you, th’ Evangelist"
2937,CANTO XIX,"Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,"
2938,CANTO XIX,"With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,"
2939,CANTO XIX,"She who with seven heads tower’d at her birth,"
2940,CANTO XIX,"And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,"
2941,CANTO XIX,Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.
2942,CANTO XIX,"Of gold and silver ye have made your god,"
2943,CANTO XIX,"Diff’ring wherein from the idolater,"
2944,CANTO XIX,"But he that worships one, a hundred ye?"
2945,CANTO XIX,"Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,"
2946,CANTO XIX,"Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,"
2947,CANTO XIX,Which the first wealthy Father gain’d from thee!”
2948,CANTO XIX,
2949,CANTO XIX,"Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath"
2950,CANTO XIX,"Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang"
2951,CANTO XIX,Spinning on either sole. I do believe
2952,CANTO XIX,"My teacher well was pleas’d, with so compos’d"
2953,CANTO XIX,"A lip, he listen’d ever to the sound"
2954,CANTO XIX,Of the true words I utter’d. In both arms
2955,CANTO XIX,"He caught, and to his bosom lifting me"
2956,CANTO XIX,Upward retrac’d the way of his descent.
2957,CANTO XIX,
2958,CANTO XIX,"Nor weary of his weight he press’d me close,"
2959,CANTO XIX,"Till to the summit of the rock we came,"
2960,CANTO XIX,Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.
2961,CANTO XIX,His cherish’d burden there gently he plac’d
2962,CANTO XIX,"Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path"
2963,CANTO XIX,Not easy for the clamb’ring goat to mount.
2964,CANTO XIX,
2965,CANTO XIX,Thence to my view another vale appear’d
2966,CANTO XIX,
2967,CANTO XIX,
2968,CANTO XIX,
2969,CANTO XIX,
2970,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
2971,CANTO XX,
2972,CANTO XX,
2973,CANTO XX,"And now the verse proceeds to torments new,"
2974,CANTO XX,Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
2975,CANTO XX,"Of the first song, whose awful theme records"
2976,CANTO XX,The spirits whelm’d in woe. Earnest I look’d
2977,CANTO XX,"Into the depth, that open’d to my view,"
2978,CANTO XX,"Moisten’d with tears of anguish, and beheld"
2979,CANTO XX,"A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,"
2980,CANTO XX,In silence weeping: such their step as walk
2981,CANTO XX,Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.
2982,CANTO XX,
2983,CANTO XX,"As on them more direct mine eye descends,"
2984,CANTO XX,Each wondrously seem’d to be revers’d
2985,CANTO XX,"At the neck-bone, so that the countenance"
2986,CANTO XX,Was from the reins averted: and because
2987,CANTO XX,"None might before him look, they were compell’d"
2988,CANTO XX,To’ advance with backward gait. Thus one perhaps
2989,CANTO XX,"Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos’d,"
2990,CANTO XX,But I ne’er saw it nor believe it so.
2991,CANTO XX,
2992,CANTO XX,"Now, reader! think within thyself, so God"
2993,CANTO XX,Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long
2994,CANTO XX,"Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld"
2995,CANTO XX,"Near me our form distorted in such guise,"
2996,CANTO XX,That on the hinder parts fall’n from the face
2997,CANTO XX,The tears down-streaming roll’d. Against a rock
2998,CANTO XX,"I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim’d:"
2999,CANTO XX,"“What, and art thou too witless as the rest?"
3000,CANTO XX,"Here pity most doth show herself alive,"
3001,CANTO XX,"When she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his,"
3002,CANTO XX,Who with Heaven’s judgment in his passion strives?
3003,CANTO XX,"Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,"
3004,CANTO XX,"Before whose eyes earth gap’d in Thebes, when all"
3005,CANTO XX,"Cried out, ‘Amphiaraus, whither rushest?"
3006,CANTO XX,‘Why leavest thou the war?’ He not the less
3007,CANTO XX,"Fell ruining far as to Minos down,"
3008,CANTO XX,Whose grapple none eludes. Lo! how he makes
3009,CANTO XX,"The breast his shoulders, and who once too far"
3010,CANTO XX,"Before him wish’d to see, now backward looks,"
3011,CANTO XX,"And treads reverse his path. Tiresias note,"
3012,CANTO XX,"Who semblance chang’d, when woman he became"
3013,CANTO XX,"Of male, through every limb transform’d, and then"
3014,CANTO XX,Once more behov’d him with his rod to strike
3015,CANTO XX,"The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,"
3016,CANTO XX,"That mark’d the better sex, might shoot again."
3017,CANTO XX,
3018,CANTO XX,"“Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes."
3019,CANTO XX,"On Luni’s mountains ’midst the marbles white,"
3020,CANTO XX,"Where delves Carrara’s hind, who wons beneath,"
3021,CANTO XX,"A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars"
3022,CANTO XX,And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.
3023,CANTO XX,
3024,CANTO XX,"“The next, whose loosen’d tresses overspread"
3025,CANTO XX,"Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair"
3026,CANTO XX,"On that side grows) was Manto, she who search’d"
3027,CANTO XX,"Through many regions, and at length her seat"
3028,CANTO XX,"Fix’d in my native land, whence a short space"
3029,CANTO XX,My words detain thy audience. When her sire
3030,CANTO XX,"From life departed, and in servitude"
3031,CANTO XX,"The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn’d,"
3032,CANTO XX,Long time she went a wand’rer through the world.
3033,CANTO XX,Aloft in Italy’s delightful land
3034,CANTO XX,"A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,"
3035,CANTO XX,"That o’er the Tyrol locks Germania in,"
3036,CANTO XX,"Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,"
3037,CANTO XX,"Methinks, and more, water between the vale"
3038,CANTO XX,Camonica and Garda and the height
3039,CANTO XX,Of Apennine remote. There is a spot
3040,CANTO XX,"At midway of that lake, where he who bears"
3041,CANTO XX,"Of Trento’s flock the past’ral staff, with him"
3042,CANTO XX,"Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each"
3043,CANTO XX,Passing that way his benediction give.
3044,CANTO XX,A garrison of goodly site and strong
3045,CANTO XX,"Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos’d"
3046,CANTO XX,"The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore"
3047,CANTO XX,"More slope each way descends. There, whatsoev’er"
3048,CANTO XX,"Benacus’ bosom holds not, tumbling o’er"
3049,CANTO XX,"Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath"
3050,CANTO XX,Through the green pastures. Soon as in his course
3051,CANTO XX,"The steam makes head, Benacus then no more"
3052,CANTO XX,"They call the name, but Mincius, till at last"
3053,CANTO XX,Reaching Governo into Po he falls.
3054,CANTO XX,"Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat"
3055,CANTO XX,"It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh"
3056,CANTO XX,"It covers, pestilent in summer oft."
3057,CANTO XX,"Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw"
3058,CANTO XX,’Midst of the fen a territory waste
3059,CANTO XX,And naked of inhabitants. To shun
3060,CANTO XX,"All human converse, here she with her slaves"
3061,CANTO XX,"Plying her arts remain’d, and liv’d, and left"
3062,CANTO XX,"Her body tenantless. Thenceforth the tribes,"
3063,CANTO XX,"Who round were scatter’d, gath’ring to that place"
3064,CANTO XX,"Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos’d"
3065,CANTO XX,On all parts by the fen. On those dead bones
3066,CANTO XX,"They rear’d themselves a city, for her sake,"
3067,CANTO XX,"Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,"
3068,CANTO XX,"Nor ask’d another omen for the name,"
3069,CANTO XX,"Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,"
3070,CANTO XX,Ere Casalodi’s madness by deceit
3071,CANTO XX,Was wrong’d of Pinamonte. If thou hear
3072,CANTO XX,Henceforth another origin assign’d
3073,CANTO XX,"Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,"
3074,CANTO XX,That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth.”
3075,CANTO XX,
3076,CANTO XX,"I answer’d: “Teacher, I conclude thy words"
3077,CANTO XX,"So certain, that all else shall be to me"
3078,CANTO XX,"As embers lacking life. But now of these,"
3079,CANTO XX,"Who here proceed, instruct me, if thou see"
3080,CANTO XX,Any that merit more especial note.
3081,CANTO XX,For thereon is my mind alone intent.”
3082,CANTO XX,
3083,CANTO XX,"He straight replied: “That spirit, from whose cheek"
3084,CANTO XX,"The beard sweeps o’er his shoulders brown, what time"
3085,CANTO XX,"Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce"
3086,CANTO XX,"The cradles were supplied, the seer was he"
3087,CANTO XX,"In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign"
3088,CANTO XX,When first to cut the cable. Him they nam’d
3089,CANTO XX,"Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,"
3090,CANTO XX,"In which majestic measure well thou know’st,"
3091,CANTO XX,"Who know’st it all. That other, round the loins"
3092,CANTO XX,"So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,"
3093,CANTO XX,Practis’d in ev’ry slight of magic wile.
3094,CANTO XX,
3095,CANTO XX,"“Guido Bonatti see: Asdente mark,"
3096,CANTO XX,"Who now were willing, he had tended still"
3097,CANTO XX,The thread and cordwain; and too late repents.
3098,CANTO XX,
3099,CANTO XX,"“See next the wretches, who the needle left,"
3100,CANTO XX,"The shuttle and the spindle, and became"
3101,CANTO XX,Diviners: baneful witcheries they wrought
3102,CANTO XX,With images and herbs. But onward now:
3103,CANTO XX,For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
3104,CANTO XX,"On either hemisphere, touching the wave"
3105,CANTO XX,Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight
3106,CANTO XX,The moon was round. Thou mayst remember well:
3107,CANTO XX,For she good service did thee in the gloom
3108,CANTO XX,"Of the deep wood.” This said, both onward mov’d."
3109,CANTO XX,
3110,CANTO XX,
3111,CANTO XX,
3112,CANTO XX,
3113,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
3114,CANTO XXI,
3115,CANTO XXI,
3116,CANTO XXI,"Thus we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,"
3117,CANTO XXI,"The which my drama cares not to rehearse,"
3118,CANTO XXI,"Pass’d on; and to the summit reaching, stood"
3119,CANTO XXI,"To view another gap, within the round"
3120,CANTO XXI,"Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs."
3121,CANTO XXI,
3122,CANTO XXI,Marvelous darkness shadow’d o’er the place.
3123,CANTO XXI,
3124,CANTO XXI,In the Venetians’ arsenal as boils
3125,CANTO XXI,"Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear"
3126,CANTO XXI,Their unsound vessels; for th’ inclement time
3127,CANTO XXI,"Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while"
3128,CANTO XXI,"His bark one builds anew, another stops"
3129,CANTO XXI,"The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;"
3130,CANTO XXI,"One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;"
3131,CANTO XXI,"This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,"
3132,CANTO XXI,The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent
3133,CANTO XXI,So not by force of fire but art divine
3134,CANTO XXI,"Boil’d here a glutinous thick mass, that round"
3135,CANTO XXI,"Lim’d all the shore beneath. I that beheld,"
3136,CANTO XXI,"But therein nought distinguish’d, save the surge,"
3137,CANTO XXI,"Rais’d by the boiling, in one mighty swell"
3138,CANTO XXI,"Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall. While there"
3139,CANTO XXI,"I fix’d my ken below, “Mark! mark!” my guide"
3140,CANTO XXI,"Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,"
3141,CANTO XXI,"Wherein I stood. I turn’d myself as one,"
3142,CANTO XXI,Impatient to behold that which beheld
3143,CANTO XXI,"He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,"
3144,CANTO XXI,That he his flight delays not for the view.
3145,CANTO XXI,"Behind me I discern’d a devil black,"
3146,CANTO XXI,"That running, up advanc’d along the rock."
3147,CANTO XXI,Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!
3148,CANTO XXI,"In act how bitter did he seem, with wings"
3149,CANTO XXI,Buoyant outstretch’d and feet of nimblest tread!
3150,CANTO XXI,His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
3151,CANTO XXI,Was with a sinner charg’d; by either haunch
3152,CANTO XXI,"He held him, the foot’s sinew griping fast."
3153,CANTO XXI,
3154,CANTO XXI,"“Ye of our bridge!” he cried, “keen-talon’d fiends!"
3155,CANTO XXI,Lo! one of Santa Zita’s elders! Him
3156,CANTO XXI,"Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more."
3157,CANTO XXI,"That land hath store of such. All men are there,"
3158,CANTO XXI,"Except Bonturo, barterers: of ‘no’"
3159,CANTO XXI,For lucre there an ‘aye’ is quickly made.”
3160,CANTO XXI,
3161,CANTO XXI,"Him dashing down, o’er the rough rock he turn’d,"
3162,CANTO XXI,Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos’d
3163,CANTO XXI,Sped with like eager haste. That other sank
3164,CANTO XXI,And forthwith writing to the surface rose.
3165,CANTO XXI,"But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,"
3166,CANTO XXI,Cried “Here the hallow’d visage saves not: here
3167,CANTO XXI,Is other swimming than in Serchio’s wave.
3168,CANTO XXI,"Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,"
3169,CANTO XXI,"Take heed thou mount not o’er the pitch.” This said,"
3170,CANTO XXI,"They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,"
3171,CANTO XXI,And shouted: “Cover’d thou must sport thee here;
3172,CANTO XXI,"So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.”"
3173,CANTO XXI,
3174,CANTO XXI,"E’en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,"
3175,CANTO XXI,To thrust the flesh into the caldron down
3176,CANTO XXI,"With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top."
3177,CANTO XXI,
3178,CANTO XXI,"Me then my guide bespake: “Lest they descry,"
3179,CANTO XXI,"That thou art here, behind a craggy rock"
3180,CANTO XXI,Bend low and screen thee; and whate’er of force
3181,CANTO XXI,"Be offer’d me, or insult, fear thou not:"
3182,CANTO XXI,"For I am well advis’d, who have been erst"
3183,CANTO XXI,In the like fray.” Beyond the bridge’s head
3184,CANTO XXI,"Therewith he pass’d, and reaching the sixth pier,"
3185,CANTO XXI,Behov’d him then a forehead terror-proof.
3186,CANTO XXI,
3187,CANTO XXI,"With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth"
3188,CANTO XXI,"Upon the poor man’s back, who suddenly"
3189,CANTO XXI,From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush’d
3190,CANTO XXI,"Those from beneath the arch, and against him"
3191,CANTO XXI,Their weapons all they pointed. He aloud:
3192,CANTO XXI,“Be none of you outrageous: ere your time
3193,CANTO XXI,"Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,"
3194,CANTO XXI,
3195,CANTO XXI,"“Who having heard my words, decide he then"
3196,CANTO XXI,"If he shall tear these limbs.” They shouted loud,"
3197,CANTO XXI,"“Go, Malacoda!” Whereat one advanc’d,"
3198,CANTO XXI,"The others standing firm, and as he came,"
3199,CANTO XXI,“What may this turn avail him?” he exclaim’d.
3200,CANTO XXI,
3201,CANTO XXI,"“Believ’st thou, Malacoda! I had come"
3202,CANTO XXI,"Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,”"
3203,CANTO XXI,"My teacher answered, “without will divine"
3204,CANTO XXI,And destiny propitious? Pass we then
3205,CANTO XXI,"For so Heaven’s pleasure is, that I should lead"
3206,CANTO XXI,Another through this savage wilderness.”
3207,CANTO XXI,
3208,CANTO XXI,"Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop"
3209,CANTO XXI,"The instrument of torture at his feet,"
3210,CANTO XXI,And to the rest exclaim’d: “We have no power
3211,CANTO XXI,To strike him.” Then to me my guide: “O thou!
3212,CANTO XXI,Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
3213,CANTO XXI,"Low crouching, safely now to me return.”"
3214,CANTO XXI,
3215,CANTO XXI,"I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends"
3216,CANTO XXI,Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz’d
3217,CANTO XXI,Lest they should break the compact they had made.
3218,CANTO XXI,"Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw"
3219,CANTO XXI,"Th’ infantry dreading, lest his covenant"
3220,CANTO XXI,The foe should break; so close he hemm’d them round.
3221,CANTO XXI,
3222,CANTO XXI,"I to my leader’s side adher’d, mine eyes"
3223,CANTO XXI,With fixt and motionless observance bent
3224,CANTO XXI,On their unkindly visage. They their hooks
3225,CANTO XXI,"Protruding, one the other thus bespake:"
3226,CANTO XXI,“Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?” To whom
3227,CANTO XXI,Was answer’d: “Even so; nor miss thy aim.”
3228,CANTO XXI,
3229,CANTO XXI,"But he, who was in conf’rence with my guide,"
3230,CANTO XXI,"Turn’d rapid round, and thus the demon spake:"
3231,CANTO XXI,"“Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!” Then to us"
3232,CANTO XXI,He added: “Further footing to your step
3233,CANTO XXI,"This rock affords not, shiver’d to the base"
3234,CANTO XXI,"Of the sixth arch. But would you still proceed,"
3235,CANTO XXI,"Up by this cavern go: not distant far,"
3236,CANTO XXI,Another rock will yield you passage safe.
3237,CANTO XXI,"Yesterday, later by five hours than now,"
3238,CANTO XXI,Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill’d
3239,CANTO XXI,"The circuit of their course, since here the way"
3240,CANTO XXI,Was broken. Thitherward I straight dispatch
3241,CANTO XXI,"Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy"
3242,CANTO XXI,If any on the surface bask. With them
3243,CANTO XXI,Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.
3244,CANTO XXI,"Come Alichino forth,” with that he cried,"
3245,CANTO XXI,"“And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!"
3246,CANTO XXI,The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.
3247,CANTO XXI,"With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,"
3248,CANTO XXI,"Fang’d Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,"
3249,CANTO XXI,"And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant."
3250,CANTO XXI,"Search ye around the bubbling tar. For these,"
3251,CANTO XXI,"In safety lead them, where the other crag"
3252,CANTO XXI,Uninterrupted traverses the dens.”
3253,CANTO XXI,
3254,CANTO XXI,I then: “O master! what a sight is there!
3255,CANTO XXI,"Ah! without escort, journey we alone,"
3256,CANTO XXI,"Which, if thou know the way, I covet not."
3257,CANTO XXI,"Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark"
3258,CANTO XXI,"How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl"
3259,CANTO XXI,Threatens us present tortures?” He replied:
3260,CANTO XXI,"“I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,"
3261,CANTO XXI,Gnarl on: ’t is but in token of their spite
3262,CANTO XXI,"Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep’d.”"
3263,CANTO XXI,
3264,CANTO XXI,To leftward o’er the pier they turn’d; but each
3265,CANTO XXI,"Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,"
3266,CANTO XXI,"Toward their leader for a signal looking,"
3267,CANTO XXI,Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.
3268,CANTO XXI,
3269,CANTO XXI,
3270,CANTO XXI,
3271,CANTO XXI,
3272,CANTO XXII,CANTO XXII
3273,CANTO XXII,
3274,CANTO XXII,
3275,CANTO XXII,It hath been heretofore my chance to see
3276,CANTO XXII,"Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,"
3277,CANTO XXII,"To onset sallying, or in muster rang’d,"
3278,CANTO XXII,Or in retreat sometimes outstretch’d for flight;
3279,CANTO XXII,Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers
3280,CANTO XXII,"Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,"
3281,CANTO XXII,"And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,"
3282,CANTO XXII,"Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,"
3283,CANTO XXII,"Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,"
3284,CANTO XXII,"And with inventions multiform, our own,"
3285,CANTO XXII,Or introduc’d from foreign land; but ne’er
3286,CANTO XXII,"To such a strange recorder I beheld,"
3287,CANTO XXII,"In evolution moving, horse nor foot,"
3288,CANTO XXII,"Nor ship, that tack’d by sign from land or star."
3289,CANTO XXII,
3290,CANTO XXII,With the ten demons on our way we went;
3291,CANTO XXII,Ah fearful company! but in the church
3292,CANTO XXII,"With saints, with gluttons at the tavern’s mess."
3293,CANTO XXII,
3294,CANTO XXII,"Still earnest on the pitch I gaz’d, to mark"
3295,CANTO XXII,"All things whate’er the chasm contain’d, and those"
3296,CANTO XXII,"Who burn’d within. As dolphins, that, in sign"
3297,CANTO XXII,"To mariners, heave high their arched backs,"
3298,CANTO XXII,That thence forewarn’d they may advise to save
3299,CANTO XXII,"Their threaten’d vessels; so, at intervals,"
3300,CANTO XXII,"To ease the pain his back some sinner show’d,"
3301,CANTO XXII,Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.
3302,CANTO XXII,
3303,CANTO XXII,"E’en as the frogs, that of a wat’ry moat"
3304,CANTO XXII,"Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,"
3305,CANTO XXII,"Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,"
3306,CANTO XXII,"Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon"
3307,CANTO XXII,"As Barbariccia was at hand, so they"
3308,CANTO XXII,"Drew back under the wave. I saw, and yet"
3309,CANTO XXII,"My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,"
3310,CANTO XXII,"As it befalls that oft one frog remains,"
3311,CANTO XXII,"While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,"
3312,CANTO XXII,"Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz’d"
3313,CANTO XXII,"His clotted locks, and dragg’d him sprawling up,"
3314,CANTO XXII,That he appear’d to me an otter. Each
3315,CANTO XXII,"Already by their names I knew, so well"
3316,CANTO XXII,"When they were chosen, I observ’d, and mark’d"
3317,CANTO XXII,How one the other call’d. “O Rubicant!
3318,CANTO XXII,"See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,”"
3319,CANTO XXII,Shouted together all the cursed crew.
3320,CANTO XXII,
3321,CANTO XXII,"Then I: “Inform thee, master! if thou may,"
3322,CANTO XXII,"What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand"
3323,CANTO XXII,His foes have laid.” My leader to his side
3324,CANTO XXII,"Approach’d, and whence he came inquir’d, to whom"
3325,CANTO XXII,Was answer’d thus: “Born in Navarre’s domain
3326,CANTO XXII,"My mother plac’d me in a lord’s retinue,"
3327,CANTO XXII,"For she had borne me to a losel vile,"
3328,CANTO XXII,A spendthrift of his substance and himself.
3329,CANTO XXII,"The good king Thibault after that I serv’d,"
3330,CANTO XXII,"To peculating here my thoughts were turn’d,"
3331,CANTO XXII,Whereof I give account in this dire heat.”
3332,CANTO XXII,
3333,CANTO XXII,"Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk"
3334,CANTO XXII,"Issued on either side, as from a boar,"
3335,CANTO XXII,Ript him with one of these. ’Twixt evil claws
3336,CANTO XXII,"The mouse had fall’n: but Barbariccia cried,"
3337,CANTO XXII,"Seizing him with both arms: “Stand thou apart,"
3338,CANTO XXII,While I do fix him on my prong transpierc’d.”
3339,CANTO XXII,"Then added, turning to my guide his face,"
3340,CANTO XXII,"“Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,"
3341,CANTO XXII,Ere he again be rent.” My leader thus:
3342,CANTO XXII,“Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;
3343,CANTO XXII,Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land
3344,CANTO XXII,"Under the tar?”—“I parted,” he replied,"
3345,CANTO XXII,"“But now from one, who sojourn’d not far thence;"
3346,CANTO XXII,So were I under shelter now with him!
3347,CANTO XXII,Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more.”—.
3348,CANTO XXII,
3349,CANTO XXII,"“Too long we suffer,” Libicocco cried,"
3350,CANTO XXII,"Then, darting forth a prong, seiz’d on his arm,"
3351,CANTO XXII,And mangled bore away the sinewy part.
3352,CANTO XXII,Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
3353,CANTO XXII,"Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,"
3354,CANTO XXII,"Turning on all sides round, with threat’ning brow"
3355,CANTO XXII,"Restrain’d them. When their strife a little ceas’d,"
3356,CANTO XXII,"Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,"
3357,CANTO XXII,My teacher thus without delay inquir’d:
3358,CANTO XXII,"“Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap"
3359,CANTO XXII,"Parting, as thou has told, thou cam’st to shore?”—"
3360,CANTO XXII,
3361,CANTO XXII,"“It was the friar Gomita,” he rejoin’d,"
3362,CANTO XXII,"“He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,"
3363,CANTO XXII,"Who had his master’s enemies in hand,"
3364,CANTO XXII,And us’d them so that they commend him well.
3365,CANTO XXII,"Money he took, and them at large dismiss’d."
3366,CANTO XXII,So he reports: and in each other charge
3367,CANTO XXII,"Committed to his keeping, play’d the part"
3368,CANTO XXII,Of barterer to the height: with him doth herd
3369,CANTO XXII,"The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche."
3370,CANTO XXII,"Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue"
3371,CANTO XXII,Is never weary. Out! alas! behold
3372,CANTO XXII,"That other, how he grins! More would I say,"
3373,CANTO XXII,But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore.”
3374,CANTO XXII,
3375,CANTO XXII,"Their captain then to Farfarello turning,"
3376,CANTO XXII,"Who roll’d his moony eyes in act to strike,"
3377,CANTO XXII,Rebuk’d him thus: “Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!”—
3378,CANTO XXII,
3379,CANTO XXII,"“If ye desire to see or hear,” he thus"
3380,CANTO XXII,"Quaking with dread resum’d, “or Tuscan spirits"
3381,CANTO XXII,"Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear."
3382,CANTO XXII,"Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,"
3383,CANTO XXII,"So that no vengeance they may fear from them,"
3384,CANTO XXII,"And I, remaining in this self-same place,"
3385,CANTO XXII,"Will for myself but one, make sev’n appear,"
3386,CANTO XXII,When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so
3387,CANTO XXII,Our custom is to call each other up.”
3388,CANTO XXII,
3389,CANTO XXII,"Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn’d,"
3390,CANTO XXII,"Then wagg’d the head and spake: “Hear his device,"
3391,CANTO XXII,"Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down.”"
3392,CANTO XXII,
3393,CANTO XXII,"Whereto he thus, who fail’d not in rich store"
3394,CANTO XXII,"Of nice-wove toils; “Mischief forsooth extreme,"
3395,CANTO XXII,Meant only to procure myself more woe!”
3396,CANTO XXII,
3397,CANTO XXII,"No longer Alichino then refrain’d,"
3398,CANTO XXII,"But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:"
3399,CANTO XXII,"“If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot"
3400,CANTO XXII,"Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat"
3401,CANTO XXII,"My plumes. Quit we the vantage ground, and let"
3402,CANTO XXII,"The bank be as a shield, that we may see"
3403,CANTO XXII,If singly thou prevail against us all.”
3404,CANTO XXII,
3405,CANTO XXII,"Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!"
3406,CANTO XXII,
3407,CANTO XXII,"They each one turn’d his eyes to the’ other shore,"
3408,CANTO XXII,"He first, who was the hardest to persuade."
3409,CANTO XXII,"The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,"
3410,CANTO XXII,"Planted his feet on land, and at one leap"
3411,CANTO XXII,Escaping disappointed their resolve.
3412,CANTO XXII,
3413,CANTO XXII,"Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,"
3414,CANTO XXII,Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit
3415,CANTO XXII,"He therefore sped, exclaiming; “Thou art caught.”"
3416,CANTO XXII,
3417,CANTO XXII,But little it avail’d: terror outstripp’d
3418,CANTO XXII,"His following flight: the other plung’d beneath,"
3419,CANTO XXII,And he with upward pinion rais’d his breast:
3420,CANTO XXII,"E’en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives"
3421,CANTO XXII,"The falcon near, dives instant down, while he"
3422,CANTO XXII,Enrag’d and spent retires. That mockery
3423,CANTO XXII,"In Calcabrina fury stirr’d, who flew"
3424,CANTO XXII,"After him, with desire of strife inflam’d;"
3425,CANTO XXII,"And, for the barterer had ’scap’d, so turn’d"
3426,CANTO XXII,His talons on his comrade. O’er the dyke
3427,CANTO XXII,In grapple close they join’d; but the’ other prov’d
3428,CANTO XXII,A goshawk able to rend well his foe;
3429,CANTO XXII,
3430,CANTO XXII,And in the boiling lake both fell. The heat
3431,CANTO XXII,"Was umpire soon between them, but in vain"
3432,CANTO XXII,"To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued"
3433,CANTO XXII,"Their pennons. Barbariccia, as the rest,"
3434,CANTO XXII,"That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch’d"
3435,CANTO XXII,"From the’ other coast, with all their weapons arm’d."
3436,CANTO XXII,"They, to their post on each side speedily"
3437,CANTO XXII,"Descending, stretch’d their hooks toward the fiends,"
3438,CANTO XXII,"Who flounder’d, inly burning from their scars:"
3439,CANTO XXII,And we departing left them to that broil.
3440,CANTO XXII,
3441,CANTO XXII,
3442,CANTO XXII,
3443,CANTO XXII,
3444,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
3445,CANTO XXIII,
3446,CANTO XXIII,
3447,CANTO XXIII,"In silence and in solitude we went,"
3448,CANTO XXIII,"One first, the other following his steps,"
3449,CANTO XXIII,As minor friars journeying on their road.
3450,CANTO XXIII,
3451,CANTO XXIII,The present fray had turn’d my thoughts to muse
3452,CANTO XXIII,"Upon old Aesop’s fable, where he told"
3453,CANTO XXIII,What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
3454,CANTO XXIII,"For language hath not sounds more like in sense,"
3455,CANTO XXIII,"Than are these chances, if the origin"
3456,CANTO XXIII,And end of each be heedfully compar’d.
3457,CANTO XXIII,"And as one thought bursts from another forth,"
3458,CANTO XXIII,"So afterward from that another sprang,"
3459,CANTO XXIII,Which added doubly to my former fear.
3460,CANTO XXIII,For thus I reason’d: “These through us have been
3461,CANTO XXIII,"So foil’d, with loss and mock’ry so complete,"
3462,CANTO XXIII,As needs must sting them sore. If anger then
3463,CANTO XXIII,"Be to their evil will conjoin’d, more fell"
3464,CANTO XXIII,"They shall pursue us, than the savage hound"
3465,CANTO XXIII,"Snatches the leveret, panting ’twixt his jaws.”"
3466,CANTO XXIII,
3467,CANTO XXIII,Already I perceiv’d my hair stand all
3468,CANTO XXIII,"On end with terror, and look’d eager back."
3469,CANTO XXIII,
3470,CANTO XXIII,"“Teacher,” I thus began, “if speedily"
3471,CANTO XXIII,"Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread"
3472,CANTO XXIII,Those evil talons. Even now behind
3473,CANTO XXIII,They urge us: quick imagination works
3474,CANTO XXIII,"So forcibly, that I already feel them.”"
3475,CANTO XXIII,
3476,CANTO XXIII,"He answer’d: “Were I form’d of leaded glass,"
3477,CANTO XXIII,I should not sooner draw unto myself
3478,CANTO XXIII,"Thy outward image, than I now imprint"
3479,CANTO XXIII,That from within. This moment came thy thoughts
3480,CANTO XXIII,"Presented before mine, with similar act"
3481,CANTO XXIII,"And count’nance similar, so that from both"
3482,CANTO XXIII,I one design have fram’d. If the right coast
3483,CANTO XXIII,"Incline so much, that we may thence descend"
3484,CANTO XXIII,"Into the other chasm, we shall escape"
3485,CANTO XXIII,Secure from this imagined pursuit.”
3486,CANTO XXIII,
3487,CANTO XXIII,"He had not spoke his purpose to the end,"
3488,CANTO XXIII,When I from far beheld them with spread wings
3489,CANTO XXIII,Approach to take us. Suddenly my guide
3490,CANTO XXIII,"Caught me, ev’n as a mother that from sleep"
3491,CANTO XXIII,"Is by the noise arous’d, and near her sees"
3492,CANTO XXIII,"The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe"
3493,CANTO XXIII,"And flies ne’er pausing, careful more of him"
3494,CANTO XXIII,"Than of herself, that but a single vest"
3495,CANTO XXIII,Clings round her limbs. Down from the jutting beach
3496,CANTO XXIII,"Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,"
3497,CANTO XXIII,Which closes on one part the other chasm.
3498,CANTO XXIII,
3499,CANTO XXIII,Never ran water with such hurrying pace
3500,CANTO XXIII,"Adown the tube to turn a landmill’s wheel,"
3501,CANTO XXIII,"When nearest it approaches to the spokes,"
3502,CANTO XXIII,"As then along that edge my master ran,"
3503,CANTO XXIII,"Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,"
3504,CANTO XXIII,Not a companion. Scarcely had his feet
3505,CANTO XXIII,"Reach’d to the lowest of the bed beneath,"
3506,CANTO XXIII,
3507,CANTO XXIII,When over us the steep they reach’d; but fear
3508,CANTO XXIII,"In him was none; for that high Providence,"
3509,CANTO XXIII,"Which plac’d them ministers of the fifth foss,"
3510,CANTO XXIII,Power of departing thence took from them all.
3511,CANTO XXIII,
3512,CANTO XXIII,"There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,"
3513,CANTO XXIII,"Who pac’d with tardy steps around, and wept,"
3514,CANTO XXIII,Faint in appearance and o’ercome with toil.
3515,CANTO XXIII,"Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down"
3516,CANTO XXIII,"Before their eyes, in fashion like to those"
3517,CANTO XXIII,Worn by the monks in Cologne. Their outside
3518,CANTO XXIII,"Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,"
3519,CANTO XXIII,"But leaden all within, and of such weight,"
3520,CANTO XXIII,That Frederick’s compar’d to these were straw.
3521,CANTO XXIII,"Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!"
3522,CANTO XXIII,
3523,CANTO XXIII,We yet once more with them together turn’d
3524,CANTO XXIII,"To leftward, on their dismal moan intent."
3525,CANTO XXIII,"But by the weight oppress’d, so slowly came"
3526,CANTO XXIII,"The fainting people, that our company"
3527,CANTO XXIII,Was chang’d at every movement of the step.
3528,CANTO XXIII,
3529,CANTO XXIII,Whence I my guide address’d: “See that thou find
3530,CANTO XXIII,"Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,"
3531,CANTO XXIII,And to that end look round thee as thou go’st.”
3532,CANTO XXIII,
3533,CANTO XXIII,"Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,"
3534,CANTO XXIII,"Cried after us aloud: “Hold in your feet,"
3535,CANTO XXIII,Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
3536,CANTO XXIII,Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.”
3537,CANTO XXIII,
3538,CANTO XXIII,"Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:"
3539,CANTO XXIII,"“Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.”"
3540,CANTO XXIII,
3541,CANTO XXIII,"I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look"
3542,CANTO XXIII,Impatient eagerness of mind was mark’d
3543,CANTO XXIII,To overtake me; but the load they bare
3544,CANTO XXIII,And narrow path retarded their approach.
3545,CANTO XXIII,
3546,CANTO XXIII,"Soon as arriv’d, they with an eye askance"
3547,CANTO XXIII,"Perus’d me, but spake not: then turning each"
3548,CANTO XXIII,To other thus conferring said: “This one
3549,CANTO XXIII,"Seems, by the action of his throat, alive."
3550,CANTO XXIII,"And, be they dead, what privilege allows"
3551,CANTO XXIII,They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?”
3552,CANTO XXIII,
3553,CANTO XXIII,"Then thus to me: “Tuscan, who visitest"
3554,CANTO XXIII,"The college of the mourning hypocrites,"
3555,CANTO XXIII,Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.”
3556,CANTO XXIII,
3557,CANTO XXIII,"“By Arno’s pleasant stream,” I thus replied,"
3558,CANTO XXIII,"“In the great city I was bred and grew,"
3559,CANTO XXIII,And wear the body I have ever worn.
3560,CANTO XXIII,"but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,"
3561,CANTO XXIII,"As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?"
3562,CANTO XXIII,What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?”
3563,CANTO XXIII,"“Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,”"
3564,CANTO XXIII,"One of them answer’d, “are so leaden gross,"
3565,CANTO XXIII,That with their weight they make the balances
3566,CANTO XXIII,"To crack beneath them. Joyous friars we were,"
3567,CANTO XXIII,"Bologna’s natives, Catalano I,"
3568,CANTO XXIII,"He Loderingo nam’d, and by thy land"
3569,CANTO XXIII,"Together taken, as men used to take"
3570,CANTO XXIII,"A single and indifferent arbiter,"
3571,CANTO XXIII,"To reconcile their strifes. How there we sped,"
3572,CANTO XXIII,Gardingo’s vicinage can best declare.”
3573,CANTO XXIII,
3574,CANTO XXIII,"“O friars!” I began, “your miseries—”"
3575,CANTO XXIII,"But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,"
3576,CANTO XXIII,Fix’d to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
3577,CANTO XXIII,"He, when he saw me, writh’d himself, throughout"
3578,CANTO XXIII,"Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard."
3579,CANTO XXIII,"And Catalano, who thereof was ’ware,"
3580,CANTO XXIII,
3581,CANTO XXIII,"Thus spake: “That pierced spirit, whom intent"
3582,CANTO XXIII,"Thou view’st, was he who gave the Pharisees"
3583,CANTO XXIII,"Counsel, that it were fitting for one man"
3584,CANTO XXIII,To suffer for the people. He doth lie
3585,CANTO XXIII,"Transverse; nor any passes, but him first"
3586,CANTO XXIII,Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
3587,CANTO XXIII,In straits like this along the foss are plac’d
3588,CANTO XXIII,"The father of his consort, and the rest"
3589,CANTO XXIII,"Partakers in that council, seed of ill"
3590,CANTO XXIII,"And sorrow to the Jews.” I noted then,"
3591,CANTO XXIII,"How Virgil gaz’d with wonder upon him,"
3592,CANTO XXIII,Thus abjectly extended on the cross
3593,CANTO XXIII,In banishment eternal. To the friar
3594,CANTO XXIII,"He next his words address’d: “We pray ye tell,"
3595,CANTO XXIII,"If so be lawful, whether on our right"
3596,CANTO XXIII,"Lies any opening in the rock, whereby"
3597,CANTO XXIII,"We both may issue hence, without constraint"
3598,CANTO XXIII,"On the dark angels, that compell’d they come"
3599,CANTO XXIII,To lead us from this depth.” He thus replied:
3600,CANTO XXIII,"“Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock"
3601,CANTO XXIII,"From the next circle moving, which o’ersteps"
3602,CANTO XXIII,"Each vale of horror, save that here his cope"
3603,CANTO XXIII,Is shatter’d. By the ruin ye may mount:
3604,CANTO XXIII,"For on the side it slants, and most the height"
3605,CANTO XXIII,Rises below.” With head bent down awhile
3606,CANTO XXIII,"My leader stood, then spake: “He warn’d us ill,"
3607,CANTO XXIII,Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.”
3608,CANTO XXIII,
3609,CANTO XXIII,To whom the friar: At Bologna erst
3610,CANTO XXIII,"“I many vices of the devil heard,"
3611,CANTO XXIII,"Among the rest was said, ‘He is a liar,"
3612,CANTO XXIII,"And the father of lies!’” When he had spoke,"
3613,CANTO XXIII,"My leader with large strides proceeded on,"
3614,CANTO XXIII,Somewhat disturb’d with anger in his look.
3615,CANTO XXIII,
3616,CANTO XXIII,"I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,"
3617,CANTO XXIII,"And following, his beloved footsteps mark’d."
3618,CANTO XXIII,
3619,CANTO XXIII,
3620,CANTO XXIII,
3621,CANTO XXIII,
3622,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
3623,CANTO XXIV,
3624,CANTO XXIV,
3625,CANTO XXIV,"In the year’s early nonage, when the sun"
3626,CANTO XXIV,"Tempers his tresses in Aquarius’ urn,"
3627,CANTO XXIV,"And now towards equal day the nights recede,"
3628,CANTO XXIV,When as the rime upon the earth puts on
3629,CANTO XXIV,"Her dazzling sister’s image, but not long"
3630,CANTO XXIV,"Her milder sway endures, then riseth up"
3631,CANTO XXIV,"The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,"
3632,CANTO XXIV,And looking out beholds the plain around
3633,CANTO XXIV,"All whiten’d, whence impatiently he smites"
3634,CANTO XXIV,"His thighs, and to his hut returning in,"
3635,CANTO XXIV,"There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,"
3636,CANTO XXIV,As a discomfited and helpless man;
3637,CANTO XXIV,"Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope"
3638,CANTO XXIV,"Spring in his bosom, finding e’en thus soon"
3639,CANTO XXIV,"The world hath chang’d its count’nance, grasps his crook,"
3640,CANTO XXIV,And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
3641,CANTO XXIV,So me my guide dishearten’d when I saw
3642,CANTO XXIV,"His troubled forehead, and so speedily"
3643,CANTO XXIV,That ill was cur’d; for at the fallen bridge
3644,CANTO XXIV,"Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,"
3645,CANTO XXIV,"He turn’d him back, as that I first beheld"
3646,CANTO XXIV,At the steep mountain’s foot. Regarding well
3647,CANTO XXIV,"The ruin, and some counsel first maintain’d"
3648,CANTO XXIV,"With his own thought, he open’d wide his arm"
3649,CANTO XXIV,"And took me up. As one, who, while he works,"
3650,CANTO XXIV,"Computes his labour’s issue, that he seems"
3651,CANTO XXIV,"Still to foresee the’ effect, so lifting me"
3652,CANTO XXIV,"Up to the summit of one peak, he fix’d"
3653,CANTO XXIV,"His eye upon another. “Grapple that,”"
3654,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, “but first make proof, if it be such"
3655,CANTO XXIV,As will sustain thee.” For one capp’d with lead
3656,CANTO XXIV,"This were no journey. Scarcely he, though light,"
3657,CANTO XXIV,"And I, though onward push’d from crag to crag,"
3658,CANTO XXIV,Could mount. And if the precinct of this coast
3659,CANTO XXIV,"Were not less ample than the last, for him"
3660,CANTO XXIV,"I know not, but my strength had surely fail’d."
3661,CANTO XXIV,But Malebolge all toward the mouth
3662,CANTO XXIV,"Inclining of the nethermost abyss,"
3663,CANTO XXIV,"The site of every valley hence requires,"
3664,CANTO XXIV,"That one side upward slope, the other fall."
3665,CANTO XXIV,
3666,CANTO XXIV,At length the point of our descent we reach’d
3667,CANTO XXIV,"From the last flag: soon as to that arriv’d,"
3668,CANTO XXIV,"So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,"
3669,CANTO XXIV,"I could no further, but did seat me there."
3670,CANTO XXIV,
3671,CANTO XXIV,“Now needs thy best of man;” so spake my guide:
3672,CANTO XXIV,"“For not on downy plumes, nor under shade"
3673,CANTO XXIV,"Of canopy reposing, fame is won,"
3674,CANTO XXIV,Without which whosoe’er consumes his days
3675,CANTO XXIV,"Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,"
3676,CANTO XXIV,As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
3677,CANTO XXIV,Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
3678,CANTO XXIV,"By the mind’s effort, in each struggle form’d"
3679,CANTO XXIV,"To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight"
3680,CANTO XXIV,Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
3681,CANTO XXIV,A longer ladder yet remains to scale.
3682,CANTO XXIV,From these to have escap’d sufficeth not.
3683,CANTO XXIV,"If well thou note me, profit by my words.”"
3684,CANTO XXIV,
3685,CANTO XXIV,"I straightway rose, and show’d myself less spent"
3686,CANTO XXIV,"Than I in truth did feel me. “On,” I cried,"
3687,CANTO XXIV,“For I am stout and fearless.” Up the rock
3688,CANTO XXIV,"Our way we held, more rugged than before,"
3689,CANTO XXIV,Narrower and steeper far to climb. From talk
3690,CANTO XXIV,"I ceas’d not, as we journey’d, so to seem"
3691,CANTO XXIV,Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
3692,CANTO XXIV,"Did issue forth, for utt’rance suited ill."
3693,CANTO XXIV,"Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,"
3694,CANTO XXIV,"What were the words I knew not, but who spake"
3695,CANTO XXIV,"Seem’d mov’d in anger. Down I stoop’d to look,"
3696,CANTO XXIV,But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
3697,CANTO XXIV,For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
3698,CANTO XXIV,"“To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,"
3699,CANTO XXIV,And from the wall dismount we; for as hence
3700,CANTO XXIV,"I hear and understand not, so I see"
3701,CANTO XXIV,"Beneath, and naught discern.”—“I answer not,”"
3702,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, “but by the deed. To fair request"
3703,CANTO XXIV,Silent performance maketh best return.”
3704,CANTO XXIV,
3705,CANTO XXIV,"We from the bridge’s head descended, where"
3706,CANTO XXIV,"To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm"
3707,CANTO XXIV,"Opening to view, I saw a crowd within"
3708,CANTO XXIV,"Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape"
3709,CANTO XXIV,"And hideous, that remembrance in my veins"
3710,CANTO XXIV,Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands
3711,CANTO XXIV,"Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,"
3712,CANTO XXIV,"Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,"
3713,CANTO XXIV,"Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire"
3714,CANTO XXIV,"Or in such numbers swarming ne’er she shew’d,"
3715,CANTO XXIV,"Not with all Ethiopia, and whate’er"
3716,CANTO XXIV,Above the Erythraean sea is spawn’d.
3717,CANTO XXIV,
3718,CANTO XXIV,Amid this dread exuberance of woe
3719,CANTO XXIV,"Ran naked spirits wing’d with horrid fear,"
3720,CANTO XXIV,"Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,"
3721,CANTO XXIV,Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
3722,CANTO XXIV,"With serpents were their hands behind them bound,"
3723,CANTO XXIV,Which through their reins infix’d the tail and head
3724,CANTO XXIV,Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one
3725,CANTO XXIV,"Near to our side, darted an adder up,"
3726,CANTO XXIV,"And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,"
3727,CANTO XXIV,Transpierc’d him. Far more quickly than e’er pen
3728,CANTO XXIV,"Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn’d, and chang’d"
3729,CANTO XXIV,"To ashes, all pour’d out upon the earth."
3730,CANTO XXIV,"When there dissolv’d he lay, the dust again"
3731,CANTO XXIV,"Uproll’d spontaneous, and the self-same form"
3732,CANTO XXIV,"Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell,"
3733,CANTO XXIV,"The’ Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years"
3734,CANTO XXIV,"Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith"
3735,CANTO XXIV,Renascent. Blade nor herb throughout his life
3736,CANTO XXIV,"He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone"
3737,CANTO XXIV,And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
3738,CANTO XXIV,"And myrrh his funeral shroud. As one that falls,"
3739,CANTO XXIV,"He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg’d"
3740,CANTO XXIV,"To earth, or through obstruction fettering up"
3741,CANTO XXIV,"In chains invisible the powers of man,"
3742,CANTO XXIV,"Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,"
3743,CANTO XXIV,Bewilder’d with the monstrous agony
3744,CANTO XXIV,"He hath endur’d, and wildly staring sighs;"
3745,CANTO XXIV,So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
3746,CANTO XXIV,
3747,CANTO XXIV,"Oh! how severe God’s judgment, that deals out"
3748,CANTO XXIV,Such blows in stormy vengeance! Who he was
3749,CANTO XXIV,"My teacher next inquir’d, and thus in few"
3750,CANTO XXIV,"He answer’d: “Vanni Fucci am I call’d,"
3751,CANTO XXIV,Not long since rained down from Tuscany
3752,CANTO XXIV,To this dire gullet. Me the beastial life
3753,CANTO XXIV,"And not the human pleas’d, mule that I was,"
3754,CANTO XXIV,Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.”
3755,CANTO XXIV,
3756,CANTO XXIV,"I then to Virgil: “Bid him stir not hence,"
3757,CANTO XXIV,And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
3758,CANTO XXIV,A man I knew him choleric and bloody.”
3759,CANTO XXIV,
3760,CANTO XXIV,"The sinner heard and feign’d not, but towards me"
3761,CANTO XXIV,"His mind directing and his face, wherein"
3762,CANTO XXIV,"Was dismal shame depictur’d, thus he spake:"
3763,CANTO XXIV,“It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
3764,CANTO XXIV,"In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than"
3765,CANTO XXIV,When I was taken from the other life.
3766,CANTO XXIV,I have no power permitted to deny
3767,CANTO XXIV,What thou inquirest. I am doom’d thus low
3768,CANTO XXIV,"To dwell, for that the sacristy by me"
3769,CANTO XXIV,"Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,"
3770,CANTO XXIV,And with the guilt another falsely charged.
3771,CANTO XXIV,"But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,"
3772,CANTO XXIV,So as thou e’er shalt ’scape this darksome realm
3773,CANTO XXIV,Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
3774,CANTO XXIV,"Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,"
3775,CANTO XXIV,Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
3776,CANTO XXIV,"From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,"
3777,CANTO XXIV,"A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,"
3778,CANTO XXIV,And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
3779,CANTO XXIV,"With arrowy hurtling o’er Piceno’s field,"
3780,CANTO XXIV,"Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike"
3781,CANTO XXIV,Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
3782,CANTO XXIV,"This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.”"
3783,CANTO XXIV,
3784,CANTO XXIV,
3785,CANTO XXIV,
3786,CANTO XXIV,
3787,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
3788,CANTO XXV,
3789,CANTO XXV,
3790,CANTO XXV,"When he had spoke, the sinner rais’d his hands"
3791,CANTO XXV,"Pointed in mockery, and cried: “Take them, God!"
3792,CANTO XXV,I level them at thee!” From that day forth
3793,CANTO XXV,The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
3794,CANTO XXV,"One of then rolling twisted, as it said,"
3795,CANTO XXV,"“Be silent, tongue!” Another to his arms"
3796,CANTO XXV,"Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself"
3797,CANTO XXV,"So close, it took from them the power to move."
3798,CANTO XXV,
3799,CANTO XXV,Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
3800,CANTO XXV,"To turn thee into ashes, cumb’ring earth"
3801,CANTO XXV,"No longer, since in evil act so far"
3802,CANTO XXV,"Thou hast outdone thy seed? I did not mark,"
3803,CANTO XXV,"Through all the gloomy circles of the’ abyss,"
3804,CANTO XXV,"Spirit, that swell’d so proudly ’gainst his God,"
3805,CANTO XXV,"Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled,"
3806,CANTO XXV,Nor utter’d more; and after him there came
3807,CANTO XXV,"A centaur full of fury, shouting, “Where"
3808,CANTO XXV,Where is the caitiff?” On Maremma’s marsh
3809,CANTO XXV,"Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch"
3810,CANTO XXV,"They swarm’d, to where the human face begins."
3811,CANTO XXV,"Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,"
3812,CANTO XXV,"With open wings, a dragon breathing fire"
3813,CANTO XXV,On whomsoe’er he met. To me my guide:
3814,CANTO XXV,"“Cacus is this, who underneath the rock"
3815,CANTO XXV,Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
3816,CANTO XXV,"He, from his brethren parted, here must tread"
3817,CANTO XXV,"A different journey, for his fraudful theft"
3818,CANTO XXV,"Of the great herd, that near him stall’d; whence found"
3819,CANTO XXV,"His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace"
3820,CANTO XXV,"Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on"
3821,CANTO XXV,"A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.”"
3822,CANTO XXV,
3823,CANTO XXV,"While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:"
3824,CANTO XXV,"And under us three spirits came, of whom"
3825,CANTO XXV,"Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim’d;"
3826,CANTO XXV,"“Say who are ye?” We then brake off discourse,"
3827,CANTO XXV,Intent on these alone. I knew them not;
3828,CANTO XXV,"But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one"
3829,CANTO XXV,"Had need to name another. “Where,” said he,"
3830,CANTO XXV,"“Doth Cianfa lurk?” I, for a sign my guide"
3831,CANTO XXV,"Should stand attentive, plac’d against my lips"
3832,CANTO XXV,"The finger lifted. If, O reader! now"
3833,CANTO XXV,"Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,"
3834,CANTO XXV,No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
3835,CANTO XXV,The witness of mine eyes. But as I looked
3836,CANTO XXV,"Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet"
3837,CANTO XXV,"Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:"
3838,CANTO XXV,"His midmost grasp’d the belly, a forefoot"
3839,CANTO XXV,Seiz’d on each arm (while deep in either cheek
3840,CANTO XXV,He flesh’d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
3841,CANTO XXV,"Were spread, ’twixt which the tail inserted curl’d"
3842,CANTO XXV,Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne’er clasp’d
3843,CANTO XXV,"A dodder’d oak, as round the other’s limbs"
3844,CANTO XXV,The hideous monster intertwin’d his own.
3845,CANTO XXV,"Then, as they both had been of burning wax,"
3846,CANTO XXV,"Each melted into other, mingling hues,"
3847,CANTO XXV,That which was either now was seen no more.
3848,CANTO XXV,"Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,"
3849,CANTO XXV,"A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,"
3850,CANTO XXV,And the clean white expires. The other two
3851,CANTO XXV,"Look’d on exclaiming: “Ah, how dost thou change,"
3852,CANTO XXV,"Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,"
3853,CANTO XXV,
3854,CANTO XXV,“Nor only one.” The two heads now became
3855,CANTO XXV,"One, and two figures blended in one form"
3856,CANTO XXV,"Appear’d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths"
3857,CANTO XXV,Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
3858,CANTO XXV,"The thighs and legs into such members chang’d,"
3859,CANTO XXV,As never eye hath seen. Of former shape
3860,CANTO XXV,All trace was vanish’d. Two yet neither seem’d
3861,CANTO XXV,"That image miscreate, and so pass’d on"
3862,CANTO XXV,With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge
3863,CANTO XXV,"Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,"
3864,CANTO XXV,"Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems"
3865,CANTO XXV,"A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,"
3866,CANTO XXV,So toward th’ entrails of the other two
3867,CANTO XXV,"Approaching seem’d, an adder all on fire,"
3868,CANTO XXV,"As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart."
3869,CANTO XXV,"In that part, whence our life is nourish’d first,"
3870,CANTO XXV,One he transpierc’d; then down before him fell
3871,CANTO XXV,Stretch’d out. The pierced spirit look’d on him
3872,CANTO XXV,"But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn’d,"
3873,CANTO XXV,As if by sleep or fev’rous fit assail’d.
3874,CANTO XXV,"He ey’d the serpent, and the serpent him."
3875,CANTO XXV,"One from the wound, the other from the mouth"
3876,CANTO XXV,"Breath’d a thick smoke, whose vap’ry columns join’d."
3877,CANTO XXV,
3878,CANTO XXV,"Lucan in mute attention now may hear,"
3879,CANTO XXV,"Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,"
3880,CANTO XXV,"Nor shine, Nasidius! Ovid now be mute."
3881,CANTO XXV,What if in warbling fiction he record
3882,CANTO XXV,"Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake"
3883,CANTO XXV,"Him chang’d, and her into a fountain clear,"
3884,CANTO XXV,I envy not; for never face to face
3885,CANTO XXV,"Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,"
3886,CANTO XXV,Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
3887,CANTO XXV,The other’s substance. They in mutual guise
3888,CANTO XXV,"So answer’d, that the serpent split his train"
3889,CANTO XXV,"Divided to a fork, and the pierc’d spirit"
3890,CANTO XXV,"Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs"
3891,CANTO XXV,"Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon"
3892,CANTO XXV,Was visible: the tail disparted took
3893,CANTO XXV,"The figure which the spirit lost, its skin"
3894,CANTO XXV,"Soft’ning, his indurated to a rind."
3895,CANTO XXV,"The shoulders next I mark’d, that ent’ring join’d"
3896,CANTO XXV,"The monster’s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet"
3897,CANTO XXV,"So lengthen’d, as the other’s dwindling shrunk."
3898,CANTO XXV,The feet behind then twisting up became
3899,CANTO XXV,"That part that man conceals, which in the wretch"
3900,CANTO XXV,Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke
3901,CANTO XXV,"With a new colour veils, and generates"
3902,CANTO XXV,"Th’ excrescent pile on one, peeling it off"
3903,CANTO XXV,"From th’ other body, lo! upon his feet"
3904,CANTO XXV,"One upright rose, and prone the other fell."
3905,CANTO XXV,Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
3906,CANTO XXV,"Were shifted, though each feature chang’d beneath."
3907,CANTO XXV,"Of him who stood erect, the mounting face"
3908,CANTO XXV,"Retreated towards the temples, and what there"
3909,CANTO XXV,"Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears"
3910,CANTO XXV,"From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg’d,"
3911,CANTO XXV,Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell’d
3912,CANTO XXV,Into due size protuberant the lips.
3913,CANTO XXV,"He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends"
3914,CANTO XXV,"His sharpen’d visage, and draws down the ears"
3915,CANTO XXV,"Into the head, as doth the slug his horns."
3916,CANTO XXV,His tongue continuous before and apt
3917,CANTO XXV,"For utt’rance, severs; and the other’s fork"
3918,CANTO XXV,Closing unites. That done the smoke was laid.
3919,CANTO XXV,"The soul, transform’d into the brute, glides off,"
3920,CANTO XXV,"Hissing along the vale, and after him"
3921,CANTO XXV,The other talking sputters; but soon turn’d
3922,CANTO XXV,"His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few"
3923,CANTO XXV,Thus to another spake: “Along this path
3924,CANTO XXV,"Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!”"
3925,CANTO XXV,
3926,CANTO XXV,So saw I fluctuate in successive change
3927,CANTO XXV,Th’ unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
3928,CANTO XXV,"And here if aught my tongue have swerv’d, events"
3929,CANTO XXV,So strange may be its warrant. O’er mine eyes
3930,CANTO XXV,"Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze."
3931,CANTO XXV,
3932,CANTO XXV,"Yet ’scap’d they not so covertly, but well"
3933,CANTO XXV,I mark’d Sciancato: he alone it was
3934,CANTO XXV,"Of the three first that came, who chang’d not: thou,"
3935,CANTO XXV,"The other’s fate, Gaville, still dost rue."
3936,CANTO XXV,
3937,CANTO XXV,
3938,CANTO XXV,
3939,CANTO XXV,
3940,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
3941,CANTO XXVI,
3942,CANTO XXVI,
3943,CANTO XXVI,Florence exult! for thou so mightily
3944,CANTO XXVI,"Hast thriven, that o’er land and sea thy wings"
3945,CANTO XXVI,"Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!"
3946,CANTO XXVI,Among the plund’rers such the three I found
3947,CANTO XXVI,"Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,"
3948,CANTO XXVI,And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
3949,CANTO XXVI,
3950,CANTO XXVI,"But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,"
3951,CANTO XXVI,"Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long"
3952,CANTO XXVI,"Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)"
3953,CANTO XXVI,Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
3954,CANTO XXVI,"Were in good time, if it befell thee now."
3955,CANTO XXVI,"Would so it were, since it must needs befall!"
3956,CANTO XXVI,"For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more."
3957,CANTO XXVI,
3958,CANTO XXVI,We from the depth departed; and my guide
3959,CANTO XXVI,"Remounting scal’d the flinty steps, which late"
3960,CANTO XXVI,"We downward trac’d, and drew me up the steep."
3961,CANTO XXVI,Pursuing thus our solitary way
3962,CANTO XXVI,"Among the crags and splinters of the rock,"
3963,CANTO XXVI,Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
3964,CANTO XXVI,
3965,CANTO XXVI,"Then sorrow seiz’d me, which e’en now revives,"
3966,CANTO XXVI,"As my thought turns again to what I saw,"
3967,CANTO XXVI,"And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb"
3968,CANTO XXVI,"The powers of nature in me, lest they run"
3969,CANTO XXVI,Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
3970,CANTO XXVI,"My gentle star, or something better gave me,"
3971,CANTO XXVI,I envy not myself the precious boon.
3972,CANTO XXVI,
3973,CANTO XXVI,"As in that season, when the sun least veils"
3974,CANTO XXVI,"His face that lightens all, what time the fly"
3975,CANTO XXVI,"Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then"
3976,CANTO XXVI,"Upon some cliff reclin’d, beneath him sees"
3977,CANTO XXVI,"Fire-flies innumerous spangling o’er the vale,"
3978,CANTO XXVI,"Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:"
3979,CANTO XXVI,With flames so numberless throughout its space
3980,CANTO XXVI,"Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth"
3981,CANTO XXVI,"Was to my view expos’d. As he, whose wrongs"
3982,CANTO XXVI,"The bears aveng’d, at its departure saw"
3983,CANTO XXVI,"Elijah’s chariot, when the steeds erect"
3984,CANTO XXVI,"Rais’d their steep flight for heav’n; his eyes meanwhile,"
3985,CANTO XXVI,"Straining pursu’d them, till the flame alone"
3986,CANTO XXVI,Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn’d;
3987,CANTO XXVI,"E’en thus along the gulf moves every flame,"
3988,CANTO XXVI,"A sinner so enfolded close in each,"
3989,CANTO XXVI,That none exhibits token of the theft.
3990,CANTO XXVI,
3991,CANTO XXVI,"Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,"
3992,CANTO XXVI,"And grasp’d a flinty mass, or else had fall’n,"
3993,CANTO XXVI,"Though push’d not from the height. The guide, who mark’d"
3994,CANTO XXVI,"How I did gaze attentive, thus began:"
3995,CANTO XXVI,
3996,CANTO XXVI,"“Within these ardours are the spirits, each"
3997,CANTO XXVI,"Swath’d in confining fire.”—“Master, thy word,”"
3998,CANTO XXVI,"I answer’d, “hath assur’d me; yet I deem’d"
3999,CANTO XXVI,"Already of the truth, already wish’d"
4000,CANTO XXVI,"To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes"
4001,CANTO XXVI,"So parted at the summit, as it seem’d"
4002,CANTO XXVI,"Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay"
4003,CANTO XXVI,The Theban brothers?” He replied: “Within
4004,CANTO XXVI,Ulysses there and Diomede endure
4005,CANTO XXVI,"Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now"
4006,CANTO XXVI,"Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."
4007,CANTO XXVI,These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
4008,CANTO XXVI,"The ambush of the horse, that open’d wide"
4009,CANTO XXVI,"A portal for that goodly seed to pass,"
4010,CANTO XXVI,Which sow’d imperial Rome; nor less the guile
4011,CANTO XXVI,"Lament they, whence of her Achilles ’reft"
4012,CANTO XXVI,Deidamia yet in death complains.
4013,CANTO XXVI,"And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy"
4014,CANTO XXVI,Of her Palladium spoil’d.”—“If they have power
4015,CANTO XXVI,"Of utt’rance from within these sparks,” said I,"
4016,CANTO XXVI,“O master! think my prayer a thousand fold
4017,CANTO XXVI,"In repetition urg’d, that thou vouchsafe"
4018,CANTO XXVI,"To pause, till here the horned flame arrive."
4019,CANTO XXVI,"See, how toward it with desire I bend.”"
4020,CANTO XXVI,
4021,CANTO XXVI,"He thus: “Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,"
4022,CANTO XXVI,And I accept it therefore: but do thou
4023,CANTO XXVI,"Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,"
4024,CANTO XXVI,"For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,"
4025,CANTO XXVI,"For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.”"
4026,CANTO XXVI,
4027,CANTO XXVI,"When there the flame had come, where time and place"
4028,CANTO XXVI,"Seem’d fitting to my guide, he thus began:"
4029,CANTO XXVI,"“O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!"
4030,CANTO XXVI,"If living I of you did merit aught,"
4031,CANTO XXVI,"Whate’er the measure were of that desert,"
4032,CANTO XXVI,"When in the world my lofty strain I pour’d,"
4033,CANTO XXVI,"Move ye not on, till one of you unfold"
4034,CANTO XXVI,In what clime death o’ertook him self-destroy’d.”
4035,CANTO XXVI,
4036,CANTO XXVI,Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
4037,CANTO XXVI,"Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire"
4038,CANTO XXVI,"That labours with the wind, then to and fro"
4039,CANTO XXVI,"Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,"
4040,CANTO XXVI,"Threw out its voice, and spake: “When I escap’d"
4041,CANTO XXVI,"From Circe, who beyond a circling year"
4042,CANTO XXVI,"Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,"
4043,CANTO XXVI,"Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam’d the shore,"
4044,CANTO XXVI,"Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence"
4045,CANTO XXVI,"Of my old father, nor return of love,"
4046,CANTO XXVI,"That should have crown’d Penelope with joy,"
4047,CANTO XXVI,Could overcome in me the zeal I had
4048,CANTO XXVI,"T’ explore the world, and search the ways of life,"
4049,CANTO XXVI,Man’s evil and his virtue. Forth I sail’d
4050,CANTO XXVI,"Into the deep illimitable main,"
4051,CANTO XXVI,"With but one bark, and the small faithful band"
4052,CANTO XXVI,"That yet cleav’d to me. As Iberia far,"
4053,CANTO XXVI,"Far as Morocco either shore I saw,"
4054,CANTO XXVI,And the Sardinian and each isle beside
4055,CANTO XXVI,Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age
4056,CANTO XXVI,"Were I and my companions, when we came"
4057,CANTO XXVI,"To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain’d"
4058,CANTO XXVI,The bound’ries not to be o’erstepp’d by man.
4059,CANTO XXVI,"The walls of Seville to my right I left,"
4060,CANTO XXVI,On the’ other hand already Ceuta past.
4061,CANTO XXVI,
4062,CANTO XXVI,"“O brothers!” I began, “who to the west"
4063,CANTO XXVI,"Through perils without number now have reach’d,"
4064,CANTO XXVI,"To this the short remaining watch, that yet"
4065,CANTO XXVI,"Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof"
4066,CANTO XXVI,"Of the unpeopled world, following the track"
4067,CANTO XXVI,Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
4068,CANTO XXVI,Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes
4069,CANTO XXVI,But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.
4070,CANTO XXVI,With these few words I sharpen’d for the voyage
4071,CANTO XXVI,"The mind of my associates, that I then"
4072,CANTO XXVI,Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn
4073,CANTO XXVI,"Our poop we turn’d, and for the witless flight"
4074,CANTO XXVI,"Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left."
4075,CANTO XXVI,"Each star of the’ other pole night now beheld,"
4076,CANTO XXVI,"And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor"
4077,CANTO XXVI,"It rose not. Five times re-illum’d, as oft"
4078,CANTO XXVI,Vanish’d the light from underneath the moon
4079,CANTO XXVI,"Since the deep way we enter’d, when from far"
4080,CANTO XXVI,"Appear’d a mountain dim, loftiest methought"
4081,CANTO XXVI,"Of all I e’er beheld. Joy seiz’d us straight,"
4082,CANTO XXVI,But soon to mourning changed. From the new land
4083,CANTO XXVI,"A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side"
4084,CANTO XXVI,Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl’d her round
4085,CANTO XXVI,"With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up"
4086,CANTO XXVI,"The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:"
4087,CANTO XXVI,And over us the booming billow clos’d.”
4088,CANTO XXVI,
4089,CANTO XXVI,
4090,CANTO XXVI,
4091,CANTO XXVI,
4092,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
4093,CANTO XVII,
4094,CANTO XVII,
4095,CANTO XVII,"Now upward rose the flame, and still’d its light"
4096,CANTO XVII,"To speak no more, and now pass’d on with leave"
4097,CANTO XVII,"From the mild poet gain’d, when following came"
4098,CANTO XVII,"Another, from whose top a sound confus’d,"
4099,CANTO XVII,"Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look."
4100,CANTO XVII,
4101,CANTO XVII,"As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully"
4102,CANTO XVII,"His cries first echoed, who had shap’d its mould,"
4103,CANTO XVII,"Did so rebellow, with the voice of him"
4104,CANTO XVII,"Tormented, that the brazen monster seem’d"
4105,CANTO XVII,Pierc’d through with pain; thus while no way they found
4106,CANTO XVII,"Nor avenue immediate through the flame,"
4107,CANTO XVII,Into its language turn’d the dismal words:
4108,CANTO XVII,"But soon as they had won their passage forth,"
4109,CANTO XVII,"Up from the point, which vibrating obey’d"
4110,CANTO XVII,"Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:"
4111,CANTO XVII,“O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!
4112,CANTO XVII,"That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,"
4113,CANTO XVII,
4114,CANTO XVII,"“Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,"
4115,CANTO XVII,Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
4116,CANTO XVII,"Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,"
4117,CANTO XVII,And with me parley: lo! it irks not me
4118,CANTO XVII,And yet I burn. If but e’en now thou fall
4119,CANTO XVII,"into this blind world, from that pleasant land"
4120,CANTO XVII,"Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,"
4121,CANTO XVII,"Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,"
4122,CANTO XVII,Have peace or war. For of the mountains there
4123,CANTO XVII,"Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,"
4124,CANTO XVII,Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.”
4125,CANTO XVII,
4126,CANTO XVII,"Leaning I listen’d yet with heedful ear,"
4127,CANTO XVII,"When, as he touch’d my side, the leader thus:"
4128,CANTO XVII,“Speak thou: he is a Latian.” My reply
4129,CANTO XVII,"Was ready, and I spake without delay:"
4130,CANTO XVII,
4131,CANTO XVII,“O spirit! who art hidden here below!
4132,CANTO XVII,Never was thy Romagna without war
4133,CANTO XVII,"In her proud tyrants’ bosoms, nor is now:"
4134,CANTO XVII,"But open war there left I none. The state,"
4135,CANTO XVII,"Ravenna hath maintain’d this many a year,"
4136,CANTO XVII,"Is steadfast. There Polenta’s eagle broods,"
4137,CANTO XVII,And in his broad circumference of plume
4138,CANTO XVII,O’ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp
4139,CANTO XVII,"The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,"
4140,CANTO XVII,And pil’d in bloody heap the host of France.
4141,CANTO XVII,
4142,CANTO XVII,"“The’ old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,"
4143,CANTO XVII,"That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,"
4144,CANTO XVII,"Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs."
4145,CANTO XVII,
4146,CANTO XVII,“Lamone’s city and Santerno’s range
4147,CANTO XVII,Under the lion of the snowy lair.
4148,CANTO XVII,"Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,"
4149,CANTO XVII,Or ever summer yields to winter’s frost.
4150,CANTO XVII,"And she, whose flank is wash’d of Savio’s wave,"
4151,CANTO XVII,"As ’twixt the level and the steep she lies,"
4152,CANTO XVII,Lives so ’twixt tyrant power and liberty.
4153,CANTO XVII,
4154,CANTO XVII,"“Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?"
4155,CANTO XVII,"Be not more hard than others. In the world,"
4156,CANTO XVII,So may thy name still rear its forehead high.”
4157,CANTO XVII,
4158,CANTO XVII,"Then roar’d awhile the fire, its sharpen’d point"
4159,CANTO XVII,"On either side wav’d, and thus breath’d at last:"
4160,CANTO XVII,"“If I did think, my answer were to one,"
4161,CANTO XVII,"Who ever could return unto the world,"
4162,CANTO XVII,"This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne’er,"
4163,CANTO XVII,"If true be told me, any from this depth"
4164,CANTO XVII,"Has found his upward way, I answer thee,"
4165,CANTO XVII,Nor fear lest infamy record the words.
4166,CANTO XVII,
4167,CANTO XVII,"“A man of arms at first, I cloth’d me then"
4168,CANTO XVII,"In good Saint Francis’ girdle, hoping so"
4169,CANTO XVII,T’ have made amends. And certainly my hope
4170,CANTO XVII,"Had fail’d not, but that he, whom curses light on,"
4171,CANTO XVII,The’ high priest again seduc’d me into sin.
4172,CANTO XVII,And how and wherefore listen while I tell.
4173,CANTO XVII,Long as this spirit mov’d the bones and pulp
4174,CANTO XVII,"My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake"
4175,CANTO XVII,The nature of the lion than the fox.
4176,CANTO XVII,"All ways of winding subtlety I knew,"
4177,CANTO XVII,"And with such art conducted, that the sound"
4178,CANTO XVII,Reach’d the world’s limit. Soon as to that part
4179,CANTO XVII,"Of life I found me come, when each behoves"
4180,CANTO XVII,To lower sails and gather in the lines;
4181,CANTO XVII,"That which before had pleased me then I rued,"
4182,CANTO XVII,And to repentance and confession turn’d;
4183,CANTO XVII,Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!
4184,CANTO XVII,"The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,"
4185,CANTO XVII,"Waging his warfare near the Lateran,"
4186,CANTO XVII,Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes
4187,CANTO XVII,"All Christians were, nor against Acre one"

4189,CANTO XVII,He his great charge nor sacred ministry
4190,CANTO XVII,"In himself, rev’renc’d, nor in me that cord,"
4191,CANTO XVII,Which us’d to mark with leanness whom it girded.
4192,CANTO XVII,"As in Socrate, Constantine besought"
4193,CANTO XVII,"To cure his leprosy Sylvester’s aid,"
4194,CANTO XVII,So me to cure the fever of his pride
4195,CANTO XVII,This man besought: my counsel to that end
4196,CANTO XVII,He ask’d: and I was silent: for his words
4197,CANTO XVII,Seem’d drunken: but forthwith he thus resum’d:
4198,CANTO XVII,‘From thy heart banish fear: of all offence
4199,CANTO XVII,"I hitherto absolve thee. In return,"
4200,CANTO XVII,"Teach me my purpose so to execute,"
4201,CANTO XVII,That Penestrino cumber earth no more.
4202,CANTO XVII,"Heav’n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut"
4203,CANTO XVII,"And open: and the keys are therefore twain,"
4204,CANTO XVII,The which my predecessor meanly priz’d.’”
4205,CANTO XVII,
4206,CANTO XVII,"Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,"
4207,CANTO XVII,"Of silence as more perilous I deem’d,"
4208,CANTO XVII,And answer’d: “Father! since thou washest me
4209,CANTO XVII,"Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,"
4210,CANTO XVII,"Large promise with performance scant, be sure,"
4211,CANTO XVII,Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.”
4212,CANTO XVII,
4213,CANTO XVII,"“When I was number’d with the dead, then came"
4214,CANTO XVII,Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark
4215,CANTO XVII,"He met, who cried: ‘Wrong me not; he is mine,"
4216,CANTO XVII,"And must below to join the wretched crew,"
4217,CANTO XVII,For the deceitful counsel which he gave.
4218,CANTO XVII,"E’er since I watch’d him, hov’ring at his hair,"
4219,CANTO XVII,No power can the impenitent absolve;
4220,CANTO XVII,"Nor to repent and will at once consist,"
4221,CANTO XVII,By contradiction absolute forbid.’”
4222,CANTO XVII,"Oh mis’ry! how I shook myself, when he"
4223,CANTO XVII,"Seiz’d me, and cried, “Thou haply thought’st me not"
4224,CANTO XVII,A disputant in logic so exact.”
4225,CANTO XVII,"To Minos down he bore me, and the judge"
4226,CANTO XVII,"Twin’d eight times round his callous back the tail,"
4227,CANTO XVII,"Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:"
4228,CANTO XVII,"“This is a guilty soul, that in the fire"
4229,CANTO XVII,Must vanish. Hence perdition-doom’d I rove
4230,CANTO XVII,A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.”
4231,CANTO XVII,
4232,CANTO XVII,"When he had thus fulfill’d his words, the flame"
4233,CANTO XVII,"In dolour parted, beating to and fro,"
4234,CANTO XVII,"And writhing its sharp horn. We onward went,"
4235,CANTO XVII,"I and my leader, up along the rock,"
4236,CANTO XVII,"Far as another arch, that overhangs"
4237,CANTO XVII,"The foss, wherein the penalty is paid"
4238,CANTO XVII,"Of those, who load them with committed sin."

4243,CANTO XXVIII,CANTO XXVIII
4244,CANTO XXVIII,
4245,CANTO XXVIII,
4246,CANTO XXVIII,"Who, e’en in words unfetter’d, might at full"
4247,CANTO XXVIII,"Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,"
4248,CANTO XXVIII,Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue
4249,CANTO XXVIII,"So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought"
4250,CANTO XXVIII,Both impotent alike. If in one band
4251,CANTO XXVIII,"Collected, stood the people all, who e’er"
4252,CANTO XXVIII,"Pour’d on Apulia’s happy soil their blood,"
4253,CANTO XXVIII,"Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war"
4254,CANTO XXVIII,When of the rings the measur’d booty made
4255,CANTO XXVIII,"A pile so high, as Rome’s historian writes"
4256,CANTO XXVIII,"Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt"
4257,CANTO XXVIII,"The grinding force of Guiscard’s Norman steel,"
4258,CANTO XXVIII,"And those the rest, whose bones are gather’d yet"
4259,CANTO XXVIII,"At Ceperano, there where treachery"
4260,CANTO XXVIII,"Branded th’ Apulian name, or where beyond"
4261,CANTO XXVIII,"Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms"
4262,CANTO XXVIII,The old Alardo conquer’d; and his limbs
4263,CANTO XXVIII,"One were to show transpierc’d, another his"
4264,CANTO XXVIII,Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this
4265,CANTO XXVIII,"Were but a thing of nought, to the’ hideous sight"
4266,CANTO XXVIII,"Of the ninth chasm. A rundlet, that hath lost"
4267,CANTO XXVIII,"Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,"
4268,CANTO XXVIII,"As one I mark’d, torn from the chin throughout"
4269,CANTO XXVIII,Down to the hinder passage: ’twixt the legs
4270,CANTO XXVIII,"Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay"
4271,CANTO XXVIII,"Open to view, and wretched ventricle,"
4272,CANTO XXVIII,That turns th’ englutted aliment to dross.
4273,CANTO XXVIII,
4274,CANTO XXVIII,"Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,"
4275,CANTO XXVIII,"He ey’d me, with his hands laid his breast bare,"
4276,CANTO XXVIII,And cried; “Now mark how I do rip me! lo!
4277,CANTO XXVIII,
4278,CANTO XXVIII,“How is Mohammed mangled! before me
4279,CANTO XXVIII,"Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face"
4280,CANTO XXVIII,Cleft to the forelock; and the others all
4281,CANTO XXVIII,"Whom here thou seest, while they liv’d, did sow"
4282,CANTO XXVIII,"Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent."
4283,CANTO XXVIII,"A fiend is here behind, who with his sword"
4284,CANTO XXVIII,"Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again"
4285,CANTO XXVIII,"Each of this ream, when we have compast round"
4286,CANTO XXVIII,"The dismal way, for first our gashes close"
4287,CANTO XXVIII,Ere we repass before him. But say who
4288,CANTO XXVIII,"Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,"
4289,CANTO XXVIII,Haply so lingering to delay the pain
4290,CANTO XXVIII,"Sentenc’d upon thy crimes?”—“Him death not yet,”"
4291,CANTO XXVIII,"My guide rejoin’d, “hath overta’en, nor sin"
4292,CANTO XXVIII,"Conducts to torment; but, that he may make"
4293,CANTO XXVIII,"Full trial of your state, I who am dead"
4294,CANTO XXVIII,"Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,"
4295,CANTO XXVIII,"Conduct him. Trust my words, for they are true.”"
4296,CANTO XXVIII,
4297,CANTO XXVIII,"More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,"
4298,CANTO XXVIII,"Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,"
4299,CANTO XXVIII,"Forgetful of their pangs. “Thou, who perchance"
4300,CANTO XXVIII,"Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou"
4301,CANTO XXVIII,"Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not"
4302,CANTO XXVIII,"Here soon to follow me, that with good store"
4303,CANTO XXVIII,"Of food he arm him, lest impris’ning snows"
4304,CANTO XXVIII,"Yield him a victim to Novara’s power,"
4305,CANTO XXVIII,No easy conquest else.” With foot uprais’d
4306,CANTO XXVIII,"For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground"
4307,CANTO XXVIII,"Then fix’d it to depart. Another shade,"
4308,CANTO XXVIII,"Pierc’d in the throat, his nostrils mutilate"
4309,CANTO XXVIII,"E’en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear"
4310,CANTO XXVIII,"Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood"
4311,CANTO XXVIII,"Gazing, before the rest advanc’d, and bar’d"
4312,CANTO XXVIII,"His wind-pipe, that without was all o’ersmear’d"
4313,CANTO XXVIII,"With crimson stain. “O thou!” said he, “whom sin"
4314,CANTO XXVIII,"Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near"
4315,CANTO XXVIII,Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft
4316,CANTO XXVIII,"Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind"
4317,CANTO XXVIII,"Piero of Medicina, if again"
4318,CANTO XXVIII,"Returning, thou behold’st the pleasant land"
4319,CANTO XXVIII,That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;
4320,CANTO XXVIII,
4321,CANTO XXVIII,"“And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts"
4322,CANTO XXVIII,"Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,"
4323,CANTO XXVIII,That if ’t is giv’n us here to scan aright
4324,CANTO XXVIII,"The future, they out of life’s tenement"
4325,CANTO XXVIII,"Shall be cast forth, and whelm’d under the waves"
4326,CANTO XXVIII,"Near to Cattolica, through perfidy"
4327,CANTO XXVIII,Of a fell tyrant. ’Twixt the Cyprian isle
4328,CANTO XXVIII,"And Balearic, ne’er hath Neptune seen"
4329,CANTO XXVIII,"An injury so foul, by pirates done"
4330,CANTO XXVIII,Or Argive crew of old. That one-ey’d traitor
4331,CANTO XXVIII,(Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
4332,CANTO XXVIII,His eye had still lack’d sight of) them shall bring
4333,CANTO XXVIII,"To conf’rence with him, then so shape his end,"
4334,CANTO XXVIII,That they shall need not ’gainst Focara’s wind
4335,CANTO XXVIII,Offer up vow nor pray’r.” I answering thus:
4336,CANTO XXVIII,
4337,CANTO XXVIII,"“Declare, as thou dost wish that I above"
4338,CANTO XXVIII,"May carry tidings of thee, who is he,"
4339,CANTO XXVIII,In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?”
4340,CANTO XXVIII,
4341,CANTO XXVIII,Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone
4342,CANTO XXVIII,"Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws"
4343,CANTO XXVIII,"Expanding, cried: “Lo! this is he I wot of;"
4344,CANTO XXVIII,He speaks not for himself: the outcast this
4345,CANTO XXVIII,"Who overwhelm’d the doubt in Caesar’s mind,"
4346,CANTO XXVIII,Affirming that delay to men prepar’d
4347,CANTO XXVIII,Was ever harmful.” Oh how terrified
4348,CANTO XXVIII,"Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut"
4349,CANTO XXVIII,"The tongue, which spake that hardy word. Then one"
4350,CANTO XXVIII,"Maim’d of each hand, uplifted in the gloom"
4351,CANTO XXVIII,"The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots"
4352,CANTO XXVIII,"Sullied his face, and cried: “‘Remember thee"
4353,CANTO XXVIII,"Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim’d,"
4354,CANTO XXVIII,"‘The deed once done there is an end,’ that prov’d"
4355,CANTO XXVIII,A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.”
4356,CANTO XXVIII,
4357,CANTO XXVIII,"I added: “Ay, and death to thine own tribe.”"
4358,CANTO XXVIII,
4359,CANTO XXVIII,"Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,"
4360,CANTO XXVIII,As one grief stung to madness. But I there
4361,CANTO XXVIII,"Still linger’d to behold the troop, and saw"
4362,CANTO XXVIII,"Things, such as I may fear without more proof"
4363,CANTO XXVIII,"To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,"
4364,CANTO XXVIII,"The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate"
4365,CANTO XXVIII,"Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within"
4366,CANTO XXVIII,And bids him on and fear not. Without doubt
4367,CANTO XXVIII,"I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,"
4368,CANTO XXVIII,"A headless trunk, that even as the rest"
4369,CANTO XXVIII,Of the sad flock pac’d onward. By the hair
4370,CANTO XXVIII,"It bore the sever’d member, lantern-wise"
4371,CANTO XXVIII,"Pendent in hand, which look’d at us and said,"
4372,CANTO XXVIII,
4373,CANTO XXVIII,"“Woe’s me!” The spirit lighted thus himself,"
4374,CANTO XXVIII,"And two there were in one, and one in two."
4375,CANTO XXVIII,How that may be he knows who ordereth so.
4376,CANTO XXVIII,
4377,CANTO XXVIII,"When at the bridge’s foot direct he stood,"
4378,CANTO XXVIII,"His arm aloft he rear’d, thrusting the head"
4379,CANTO XXVIII,"Full in our view, that nearer we might hear"
4380,CANTO XXVIII,"The words, which thus it utter’d: “Now behold"
4381,CANTO XXVIII,"This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go’st"
4382,CANTO XXVIII,To spy the dead; behold if any else
4383,CANTO XXVIII,Be terrible as this. And that on earth
4384,CANTO XXVIII,"Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I"
4385,CANTO XXVIII,"Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John"
4386,CANTO XXVIII,The counsel mischievous. Father and son
4387,CANTO XXVIII,I set at mutual war. For Absalom
4388,CANTO XXVIII,"And David more did not Ahitophel,"
4389,CANTO XXVIII,Spurring them on maliciously to strife.
4390,CANTO XXVIII,"For parting those so closely knit, my brain"
4391,CANTO XXVIII,"Parted, alas! I carry from its source,"
4392,CANTO XXVIII,That in this trunk inhabits. Thus the law
4393,CANTO XXVIII,Of retribution fiercely works in me.”
4394,CANTO XXVIII,
4395,CANTO XXVIII,
4396,CANTO XXVIII,
4397,CANTO XXVIII,
4398,CANTO XXIX,CANTO XXIX
4399,CANTO XXIX,
4400,CANTO XXIX,
4401,CANTO XXIX,So were mine eyes inebriate with view
4402,CANTO XXIX,"Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds"
4403,CANTO XXIX,"Disfigur’d, that they long’d to stay and weep."
4404,CANTO XXIX,
4405,CANTO XXIX,But Virgil rous’d me: “What yet gazest on?
4406,CANTO XXIX,Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
4407,CANTO XXIX,Among the maim’d and miserable shades?
4408,CANTO XXIX,Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
4409,CANTO XXIX,"This weakness. Know, if thou wouldst number them"
4410,CANTO XXIX,That two and twenty miles the valley winds
4411,CANTO XXIX,"Its circuit, and already is the moon"
4412,CANTO XXIX,Beneath our feet: the time permitted now
4413,CANTO XXIX,"Is short, and more not seen remains to see.”"
4414,CANTO XXIX,
4415,CANTO XXIX,"“If thou,” I straight replied, “hadst weigh’d the cause"
4416,CANTO XXIX,"For which I look’d, thou hadst perchance excus’d"
4417,CANTO XXIX,The tarrying still.” My leader part pursu’d
4418,CANTO XXIX,"His way, the while I follow’d, answering him,"
4419,CANTO XXIX,"And adding thus: “Within that cave I deem,"
4420,CANTO XXIX,"Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,"
4421,CANTO XXIX,"There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,"
4422,CANTO XXIX,Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear.”
4423,CANTO XXIX,
4424,CANTO XXIX,Then spake my master: “Let thy soul no more
4425,CANTO XXIX,Afflict itself for him. Direct elsewhere
4426,CANTO XXIX,"Its thought, and leave him. At the bridge’s foot"
4427,CANTO XXIX,I mark’d how he did point with menacing look
4428,CANTO XXIX,"At thee, and heard him by the others nam’d"
4429,CANTO XXIX,Geri of Bello. Thou so wholly then
4430,CANTO XXIX,"Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul’d"
4431,CANTO XXIX,"The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not"
4432,CANTO XXIX,"That way, ere he was gone.”—“O guide belov’d!"
4433,CANTO XXIX,"His violent death yet unaveng’d,” said I,"
4434,CANTO XXIX,"“By any, who are partners in his shame,"
4435,CANTO XXIX,"Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,"
4436,CANTO XXIX,He pass’d me speechless by; and doing so
4437,CANTO XXIX,Hath made me more compassionate his fate.”
4438,CANTO XXIX,
4439,CANTO XXIX,So we discours’d to where the rock first show’d
4440,CANTO XXIX,"The other valley, had more light been there,"
4441,CANTO XXIX,E’en to the lowest depth. Soon as we came
4442,CANTO XXIX,O’er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
4443,CANTO XXIX,"Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood"
4444,CANTO XXIX,"Were to our view expos’d, then many a dart"
4445,CANTO XXIX,"Of sore lament assail’d me, headed all"
4446,CANTO XXIX,"With points of thrilling pity, that I clos’d"
4447,CANTO XXIX,Both ears against the volley with mine hands.
4448,CANTO XXIX,
4449,CANTO XXIX,"As were the torment, if each lazar-house"
4450,CANTO XXIX,"Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time"
4451,CANTO XXIX,"’Twixt July and September, with the isle"
4452,CANTO XXIX,"Sardinia and Maremma’s pestilent fen,"
4453,CANTO XXIX,Had heap’d their maladies all in one foss
4454,CANTO XXIX,Together; such was here the torment: dire
4455,CANTO XXIX,"The stench, as issuing steams from fester’d limbs."
4456,CANTO XXIX,
4457,CANTO XXIX,We on the utmost shore of the long rock
4458,CANTO XXIX,Descended still to leftward. Then my sight
4459,CANTO XXIX,"Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein"
4460,CANTO XXIX,"The minister of the most mighty Lord,"
4461,CANTO XXIX,"All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment"
4462,CANTO XXIX,The forgers noted on her dread record.
4463,CANTO XXIX,
4464,CANTO XXIX,More rueful was it not methinks to see
4465,CANTO XXIX,"The nation in Aegina droop, what time"
4466,CANTO XXIX,"Each living thing, e’en to the little worm,"
4467,CANTO XXIX,"All fell, so full of malice was the air"
4468,CANTO XXIX,"(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,"
4469,CANTO XXIX,The ancient people were restor’d anew
4470,CANTO XXIX,From seed of emmets) than was here to see
4471,CANTO XXIX,"The spirits, that languish’d through the murky vale"
4472,CANTO XXIX,"Up-pil’d on many a stack. Confus’d they lay,"
4473,CANTO XXIX,"One o’er the belly, o’er the shoulders one"
4474,CANTO XXIX,Roll’d of another; sideling crawl’d a third
4475,CANTO XXIX,Along the dismal pathway. Step by step
4476,CANTO XXIX,"We journey’d on, in silence looking round"
4477,CANTO XXIX,"And list’ning those diseas’d, who strove in vain"
4478,CANTO XXIX,"To lift their forms. Then two I mark’d, that sat"
4479,CANTO XXIX,"Propp’d ’gainst each other, as two brazen pans"
4480,CANTO XXIX,"Set to retain the heat. From head to foot,"
4481,CANTO XXIX,A tetter bark’d them round. Nor saw I e’er
4482,CANTO XXIX,"Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord"
4483,CANTO XXIX,"Impatient waited, or himself perchance"
4484,CANTO XXIX,"Tir’d with long watching, as of these each one"
4485,CANTO XXIX,"Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness"
4486,CANTO XXIX,Of ne’er abated pruriency. The crust
4487,CANTO XXIX,"Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales"
4488,CANTO XXIX,Scrap’d from the bream or fish of broader mail.
4489,CANTO XXIX,
4490,CANTO XXIX,"“O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off"
4491,CANTO XXIX,"Thy coat of proof,” thus spake my guide to one,"
4492,CANTO XXIX,"“And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,"
4493,CANTO XXIX,Tell me if any born of Latian land
4494,CANTO XXIX,Be among these within: so may thy nails
4495,CANTO XXIX,Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.”
4496,CANTO XXIX,
4497,CANTO XXIX,"“Both are of Latium,” weeping he replied,"
4498,CANTO XXIX,“Whom tortur’d thus thou seest: but who art thou
4499,CANTO XXIX,That hast inquir’d of us?” To whom my guide:
4500,CANTO XXIX,"“One that descend with this man, who yet lives,"
4501,CANTO XXIX,"From rock to rock, and show him hell’s abyss.”"
4502,CANTO XXIX,
4503,CANTO XXIX,"Then started they asunder, and each turn’d"
4504,CANTO XXIX,"Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear"
4505,CANTO XXIX,Those words redounding struck. To me my liege
4506,CANTO XXIX,Address’d him: “Speak to them whate’er thou list.”
4507,CANTO XXIX,
4508,CANTO XXIX,And I therewith began: “So may no time
4509,CANTO XXIX,Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
4510,CANTO XXIX,"In th’ upper world, but after many suns"
4511,CANTO XXIX,"Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,"
4512,CANTO XXIX,"And of what race ye come. Your punishment,"
4513,CANTO XXIX,"Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,"
4514,CANTO XXIX,Deter you not from opening thus much to me.”
4515,CANTO XXIX,
4516,CANTO XXIX,"“Arezzo was my dwelling,” answer’d one,"
4517,CANTO XXIX,“And me Albero of Sienna brought
4518,CANTO XXIX,"To die by fire; but that, for which I died,"
4519,CANTO XXIX,"Leads me not here. True is in sport I told him,"
4520,CANTO XXIX,That I had learn’d to wing my flight in air.
4521,CANTO XXIX,"And he admiring much, as he was void"
4522,CANTO XXIX,"Of wisdom, will’d me to declare to him"
4523,CANTO XXIX,"The secret of mine art: and only hence,"
4524,CANTO XXIX,"Because I made him not a Daedalus,"
4525,CANTO XXIX,Prevail’d on one suppos’d his sire to burn me.
4526,CANTO XXIX,"But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,"
4527,CANTO XXIX,"For that I practis’d alchemy on earth,"
4528,CANTO XXIX,Has doom’d me. Him no subterfuge eludes.”
4529,CANTO XXIX,
4530,CANTO XXIX,Then to the bard I spake: “Was ever race
4531,CANTO XXIX,Light as Sienna’s? Sure not France herself
4532,CANTO XXIX,Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain.”
4533,CANTO XXIX,
4534,CANTO XXIX,"The other leprous spirit heard my words,"
4535,CANTO XXIX,And thus return’d: “Be Stricca from this charge
4536,CANTO XXIX,"Exempted, he who knew so temp’rately"
4537,CANTO XXIX,To lay out fortune’s gifts; and Niccolo
4538,CANTO XXIX,Who first the spice’s costly luxury
4539,CANTO XXIX,"Discover’d in that garden, where such seed"
4540,CANTO XXIX,Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop
4541,CANTO XXIX,"Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano"
4542,CANTO XXIX,"Lavish’d his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,"
4543,CANTO XXIX,And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show’d
4544,CANTO XXIX,A spectacle for all. That thou mayst know
4545,CANTO XXIX,Who seconds thee against the Siennese
4546,CANTO XXIX,"Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen’d sight,"
4547,CANTO XXIX,That well my face may answer to thy ken;
4548,CANTO XXIX,"So shalt thou see I am Capocchio’s ghost,"
4549,CANTO XXIX,Who forg’d transmuted metals by the power
4550,CANTO XXIX,"Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,"
4551,CANTO XXIX,Thus needs must well remember how I aped
4552,CANTO XXIX,Creative nature by my subtle art.”
4553,CANTO XXIX,

4556,CANTO XXIX,
4557,CANTO XXX,CANTO XXX

4560,CANTO XXX,What time resentment burn’d in Juno’s breast
4561,CANTO XXX,"For Semele against the Theban blood,"
4562,CANTO XXX,"As more than once in dire mischance was rued,"
4563,CANTO XXX,"Such fatal frenzy seiz’d on Athamas,"
4564,CANTO XXX,That he his spouse beholding with a babe
4565,CANTO XXX,"Laden on either arm, “Spread out,” he cried,"
4566,CANTO XXX,"“The meshes, that I take the lioness"
4567,CANTO XXX,And the young lions at the pass:” then forth
4568,CANTO XXX,"Stretch’d he his merciless talons, grasping one,"
4569,CANTO XXX,"One helpless innocent, Learchus nam’d,"
4570,CANTO XXX,"Whom swinging down he dash’d upon a rock,"
4571,CANTO XXX,And with her other burden self-destroy’d
4572,CANTO XXX,The hapless mother plung’d: and when the pride
4573,CANTO XXX,"Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,"
4574,CANTO XXX,"By fortune overwhelm’d, and the old king"
4575,CANTO XXX,"With his realm perish’d, then did Hecuba,"
4576,CANTO XXX,"A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw"
4577,CANTO XXX,"Polyxena first slaughter’d, and her son,"
4578,CANTO XXX,"Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach"
4579,CANTO XXX,"Next met the mourner’s view, then reft of sense"
4580,CANTO XXX,Did she run barking even as a dog;
4581,CANTO XXX,Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.
4582,CANTO XXX,Bet ne’er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
4583,CANTO XXX,"With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads"
4584,CANTO XXX,"Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,"
4585,CANTO XXX,As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
4586,CANTO XXX,"That gnarling wildly scamper’d, like the swine"
4587,CANTO XXX,"Excluded from his stye. One reach’d Capocchio,"
4588,CANTO XXX,"And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,"
4589,CANTO XXX,"Dragg’d him, that o’er the solid pavement rubb’d"
4590,CANTO XXX,"His belly stretch’d out prone. The other shape,"
4591,CANTO XXX,"He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;"
4592,CANTO XXX,“That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood
4593,CANTO XXX,Of random mischief vent he still his spite.”
4594,CANTO XXX,
4595,CANTO XXX,"To whom I answ’ring: “Oh! as thou dost hope,"
4596,CANTO XXX,"The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,"
4597,CANTO XXX,"Be patient to inform us, who it is,"
4598,CANTO XXX,Ere it speed hence.”—“That is the ancient soul
4599,CANTO XXX,"Of wretched Myrrha,” he replied, “who burn’d"
4600,CANTO XXX,"With most unholy flame for her own sire,"
4601,CANTO XXX,
4602,CANTO XXX,"“And a false shape assuming, so perform’d"
4603,CANTO XXX,"The deed of sin; e’en as the other there,"
4604,CANTO XXX,"That onward passes, dar’d to counterfeit"
4605,CANTO XXX,"Donati’s features, to feign’d testament"
4606,CANTO XXX,"The seal affixing, that himself might gain,"
4607,CANTO XXX,"For his own share, the lady of the herd.”"
4608,CANTO XXX,
4609,CANTO XXX,"When vanish’d the two furious shades, on whom"
4610,CANTO XXX,"Mine eye was held, I turn’d it back to view"
4611,CANTO XXX,The other cursed spirits. One I saw
4612,CANTO XXX,"In fashion like a lute, had but the groin"
4613,CANTO XXX,"Been sever’d, where it meets the forked part."
4614,CANTO XXX,"Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs"
4615,CANTO XXX,"With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch"
4616,CANTO XXX,"Suits not the visage, open’d wide his lips"
4617,CANTO XXX,"Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,"
4618,CANTO XXX,"One towards the chin, the other upward curl’d."
4619,CANTO XXX,
4620,CANTO XXX,"“O ye, who in this world of misery,"
4621,CANTO XXX,"Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,”"
4622,CANTO XXX,"Thus he began, “attentively regard"
4623,CANTO XXX,"Adamo’s woe. When living, full supply"
4624,CANTO XXX,Ne’er lack’d me of what most I coveted;
4625,CANTO XXX,"One drop of water now, alas! I crave."
4626,CANTO XXX,"The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes"
4627,CANTO XXX,"Of Casentino, making fresh and soft"
4628,CANTO XXX,"The banks whereby they glide to Arno’s stream,"
4629,CANTO XXX,Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;
4630,CANTO XXX,"For more the pictur’d semblance dries me up,"
4631,CANTO XXX,"Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh"
4632,CANTO XXX,"Desert these shrivel’d cheeks. So from the place,"
4633,CANTO XXX,"Where I transgress’d, stern justice urging me,"
4634,CANTO XXX,Takes means to quicken more my lab’ring sighs.
4635,CANTO XXX,"There is Romena, where I falsified"
4636,CANTO XXX,"The metal with the Baptist’s form imprest,"
4637,CANTO XXX,For which on earth I left my body burnt.
4638,CANTO XXX,But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
4639,CANTO XXX,"Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,"
4640,CANTO XXX,For Branda’s limpid spring I would not change
4641,CANTO XXX,"The welcome sight. One is e’en now within,"
4642,CANTO XXX,"If truly the mad spirits tell, that round"
4643,CANTO XXX,Are wand’ring. But wherein besteads me that?
4644,CANTO XXX,"My limbs are fetter’d. Were I but so light,"
4645,CANTO XXX,"That I each hundred years might move one inch,"
4646,CANTO XXX,"I had set forth already on this path,"
4647,CANTO XXX,"Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,"
4648,CANTO XXX,"Although eleven miles it wind, not more"
4649,CANTO XXX,Than half of one across. They brought me down
4650,CANTO XXX,Among this tribe; induc’d by them I stamp’d
4651,CANTO XXX,The florens with three carats of alloy.”
4652,CANTO XXX,
4653,CANTO XXX,"“Who are that abject pair,” I next inquir’d,"
4654,CANTO XXX,“That closely bounding thee upon thy right
4655,CANTO XXX,"Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep’d"
4656,CANTO XXX,"In the chill stream?”—“When to this gulf I dropt,”"
4657,CANTO XXX,"He answer’d, “here I found them; since that hour"
4658,CANTO XXX,"They have not turn’d, nor ever shall, I ween,"
4659,CANTO XXX,Till time hath run his course. One is that dame
4660,CANTO XXX,The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;
4661,CANTO XXX,"Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy."
4662,CANTO XXX,"Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,"
4663,CANTO XXX,"In such a cloud upsteam’d.” When that he heard,"
4664,CANTO XXX,"One, gall’d perchance to be so darkly nam’d,"
4665,CANTO XXX,"With clench’d hand smote him on the braced paunch,"
4666,CANTO XXX,That like a drum resounded: but forthwith
4667,CANTO XXX,"Adamo smote him on the face, the blow"
4668,CANTO XXX,"Returning with his arm, that seem’d as hard."
4669,CANTO XXX,
4670,CANTO XXX,“Though my o’erweighty limbs have ta’en from me
4671,CANTO XXX,"The power to move,” said he, “I have an arm"
4672,CANTO XXX,At liberty for such employ.” To whom
4673,CANTO XXX,"Was answer’d: “When thou wentest to the fire,"
4674,CANTO XXX,"Thou hadst it not so ready at command,"
4675,CANTO XXX,Then readier when it coin’d th’ impostor gold.”
4676,CANTO XXX,
4677,CANTO XXX,"And thus the dropsied: “Ay, now speak’st thou true."
4678,CANTO XXX,"But there thou gav’st not such true testimony,"
4679,CANTO XXX,"When thou wast question’d of the truth, at Troy.”"
4680,CANTO XXX,
4681,CANTO XXX,"“If I spake false, thou falsely stamp’dst the coin,”"
4682,CANTO XXX,"Said Sinon; “I am here but for one fault,"
4683,CANTO XXX,And thou for more than any imp beside.”
4684,CANTO XXX,
4685,CANTO XXX,"“Remember,” he replied, “O perjur’d one,"
4686,CANTO XXX,"The horse remember, that did teem with death,"
4687,CANTO XXX,And all the world be witness to thy guilt.”
4688,CANTO XXX,
4689,CANTO XXX,"“To thine,” return’d the Greek, “witness the thirst"
4690,CANTO XXX,"Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,"
4691,CANTO XXX,"Rear’d by thy belly up before thine eyes,"
4692,CANTO XXX,A mass corrupt.” To whom the coiner thus:
4693,CANTO XXX,“Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
4694,CANTO XXX,"Its evil saying. Me if thirst assails,"
4695,CANTO XXX,"Yet I am stuff’d with moisture. Thou art parch’d,"
4696,CANTO XXX,"Pains rack thy head, no urging would’st thou need"
4697,CANTO XXX,To make thee lap Narcissus’ mirror up.”
4698,CANTO XXX,
4699,CANTO XXX,"I was all fix’d to listen, when my guide"
4700,CANTO XXX,Admonish’d: “Now beware: a little more.
4701,CANTO XXX,And I do quarrel with thee.” I perceiv’d
4702,CANTO XXX,"How angrily he spake, and towards him turn’d"
4703,CANTO XXX,"With shame so poignant, as remember’d yet"
4704,CANTO XXX,Confounds me. As a man that dreams of harm
4705,CANTO XXX,"Befall’n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,"
4706,CANTO XXX,"And that which is, desires as if it were not,"
4707,CANTO XXX,"Such then was I, who wanting power to speak"
4708,CANTO XXX,"Wish’d to excuse myself, and all the while"
4709,CANTO XXX,"Excus’d me, though unweeting that I did."
4710,CANTO XXX,
4711,CANTO XXX,"“More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,”"
4712,CANTO XXX,"My master cried, “might expiate. Therefore cast"
4713,CANTO XXX,All sorrow from thy soul; and if again
4714,CANTO XXX,"Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,"
4715,CANTO XXX,Think I am ever at thy side. To hear
4716,CANTO XXX,Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.”
4717,CANTO XXX,
4718,CANTO XXX,
4719,CANTO XXX,
4720,CANTO XXX,
4721,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
4722,CANTO XXXI,
4723,CANTO XXXI,
4724,CANTO XXXI,"The very tongue, whose keen reproof before"
4725,CANTO XXXI,"Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain’d,"
4726,CANTO XXXI,"Now minister’d my cure. So have I heard,"
4727,CANTO XXXI,Achilles and his father’s javelin caus’d
4728,CANTO XXXI,"Pain first, and then the boon of health restor’d."
4729,CANTO XXXI,
4730,CANTO XXXI,"Turning our back upon the vale of woe,"
4731,CANTO XXXI,W cross’d th’ encircled mound in silence. There
4732,CANTO XXXI,"Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom"
4733,CANTO XXXI,Mine eye advanc’d not: but I heard a horn
4734,CANTO XXXI,Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made
4735,CANTO XXXI,The thunder feeble. Following its course
4736,CANTO XXXI,"The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent"
4737,CANTO XXXI,On that one spot. So terrible a blast
4738,CANTO XXXI,"Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout"
4739,CANTO XXXI,"O’erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench’d"
4740,CANTO XXXI,His saintly warfare. Thitherward not long
4741,CANTO XXXI,"My head was rais’d, when many lofty towers"
4742,CANTO XXXI,"Methought I spied. “Master,” said I, “what land"
4743,CANTO XXXI,Is this?” He answer’d straight: “Too long a space
4744,CANTO XXXI,Of intervening darkness has thine eye
4745,CANTO XXXI,To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err’d
4746,CANTO XXXI,In thy imagining. Thither arriv’d
4747,CANTO XXXI,"Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude"
4748,CANTO XXXI,The sense. A little therefore urge thee on.”
4749,CANTO XXXI,
4750,CANTO XXXI,Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;
4751,CANTO XXXI,"“Yet know,” said he, “ere farther we advance,"
4752,CANTO XXXI,"That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,"
4753,CANTO XXXI,"But giants. In the pit they stand immers’d,"
4754,CANTO XXXI,"Each from his navel downward, round the bank.”"
4755,CANTO XXXI,
4756,CANTO XXXI,"As when a fog disperseth gradually,"
4757,CANTO XXXI,Our vision traces what the mist involves
4758,CANTO XXXI,Condens’d in air; so piercing through the gross
4759,CANTO XXXI,"And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more"
4760,CANTO XXXI,"We near’d toward the brink, mine error fled,"
4761,CANTO XXXI,And fear came o’er me. As with circling round
4762,CANTO XXXI,"Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,"
4763,CANTO XXXI,"E’en thus the shore, encompassing th’ abyss,"
4764,CANTO XXXI,"Was turreted with giants, half their length"
4765,CANTO XXXI,"Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav’n"
4766,CANTO XXXI,"Yet threatens, when his mutt’ring thunder rolls."
4767,CANTO XXXI,
4768,CANTO XXXI,"Of one already I descried the face,"
4769,CANTO XXXI,"Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge"
4770,CANTO XXXI,"Great part, and both arms down along his ribs."
4771,CANTO XXXI,
4772,CANTO XXXI,"All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand"
4773,CANTO XXXI,"Left framing of these monsters, did display"
4774,CANTO XXXI,"Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War"
4775,CANTO XXXI,Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she
4776,CANTO XXXI,"Repent her not of th’ elephant and whale,"
4777,CANTO XXXI,Who ponders well confesses her therein
4778,CANTO XXXI,Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force
4779,CANTO XXXI,"And evil will are back’d with subtlety,"
4780,CANTO XXXI,Resistance none avails. His visage seem’d
4781,CANTO XXXI,"In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops"
4782,CANTO XXXI,Saint Peter’s Roman fane; and th’ other bones
4783,CANTO XXXI,"Of like proportion, so that from above"
4784,CANTO XXXI,"The bank, which girdled him below, such height"
4785,CANTO XXXI,"Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders"
4786,CANTO XXXI,Had striv’n in vain to reach but to his hair.
4787,CANTO XXXI,Full thirty ample palms was he expos’d
4788,CANTO XXXI,Downward from whence a man his garments loops.
4789,CANTO XXXI,"“Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,”"
4790,CANTO XXXI,"So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns"
4791,CANTO XXXI,Became not; and my guide address’d him thus:
4792,CANTO XXXI,
4793,CANTO XXXI,“O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee
4794,CANTO XXXI,"Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage"
4795,CANTO XXXI,"Or other passion wring thee. Search thy neck,"
4796,CANTO XXXI,There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.
4797,CANTO XXXI,"Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast"
4798,CANTO XXXI,Where hangs the baldrick!” Then to me he spake:
4799,CANTO XXXI,"“He doth accuse himself. Nimrod is this,"
4800,CANTO XXXI,Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
4801,CANTO XXXI,"One tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste"
4802,CANTO XXXI,"Our words; for so each language is to him,"
4803,CANTO XXXI,"As his to others, understood by none.”"
4804,CANTO XXXI,
4805,CANTO XXXI,"Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,"
4806,CANTO XXXI,And at a sling’s throw found another shade
4807,CANTO XXXI,Far fiercer and more huge. I cannot say
4808,CANTO XXXI,What master hand had girt him; but he held
4809,CANTO XXXI,"Behind the right arm fetter’d, and before"
4810,CANTO XXXI,"The other with a chain, that fasten’d him"
4811,CANTO XXXI,"From the neck down, and five times round his form"
4812,CANTO XXXI,Apparent met the wreathed links. “This proud one
4813,CANTO XXXI,Would of his strength against almighty Jove
4814,CANTO XXXI,"Make trial,” said my guide; “whence he is thus"
4815,CANTO XXXI,Requited: Ephialtes him they call.
4816,CANTO XXXI,
4817,CANTO XXXI,"“Great was his prowess, when the giants brought"
4818,CANTO XXXI,"Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,"
4819,CANTO XXXI,Now moves he never.” Forthwith I return’d:
4820,CANTO XXXI,"“Fain would I, if ’t were possible, mine eyes"
4821,CANTO XXXI,Of Briareus immeasurable gain’d
4822,CANTO XXXI,Experience next.” He answer’d: “Thou shalt see
4823,CANTO XXXI,"Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks"
4824,CANTO XXXI,"And is unfetter’d, who shall place us there"
4825,CANTO XXXI,Where guilt is at its depth. Far onward stands
4826,CANTO XXXI,"Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made"
4827,CANTO XXXI,"Like to this spirit, save that in his looks"
4828,CANTO XXXI,More fell he seems.” By violent earthquake rock’d
4829,CANTO XXXI,"Ne’er shook a tow’r, so reeling to its base,"
4830,CANTO XXXI,As Ephialtes. More than ever then
4831,CANTO XXXI,"I dreaded death, nor than the terror more"
4832,CANTO XXXI,"Had needed, if I had not seen the cords"
4833,CANTO XXXI,"That held him fast. We, straightway journeying on,"
4834,CANTO XXXI,"Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete"
4835,CANTO XXXI,"Without the head, forth issued from the cave."
4836,CANTO XXXI,
4837,CANTO XXXI,"“O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made"
4838,CANTO XXXI,"Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword"
4839,CANTO XXXI,"Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,"
4840,CANTO XXXI,Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
4841,CANTO XXXI,An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought
4842,CANTO XXXI,"In the high conflict on thy brethren’s side,"
4843,CANTO XXXI,"Seems as men yet believ’d, that through thine arm"
4844,CANTO XXXI,"The sons of earth had conquer’d, now vouchsafe"
4845,CANTO XXXI,"To place us down beneath, where numbing cold"
4846,CANTO XXXI,Locks up Cocytus. Force not that we crave
4847,CANTO XXXI,Or Tityus’ help or Typhon’s. Here is one
4848,CANTO XXXI,Can give what in this realm ye covet. Stoop
4849,CANTO XXXI,"Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip."
4850,CANTO XXXI,He in the upper world can yet bestow
4851,CANTO XXXI,"Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks"
4852,CANTO XXXI,"For life yet longer, if before the time"
4853,CANTO XXXI,Grace call him not unto herself.” Thus spake
4854,CANTO XXXI,"The teacher. He in haste forth stretch’d his hands,"
4855,CANTO XXXI,And caught my guide. Alcides whilom felt
4856,CANTO XXXI,That grapple straighten’d score. Soon as my guide
4857,CANTO XXXI,"Had felt it, he bespake me thus: “This way"
4858,CANTO XXXI,"That I may clasp thee;” then so caught me up,"
4859,CANTO XXXI,That we were both one burden. As appears
4860,CANTO XXXI,"The tower of Carisenda, from beneath"
4861,CANTO XXXI,"Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud"
4862,CANTO XXXI,"So sail across, that opposite it hangs,"
4863,CANTO XXXI,"Such then Antaeus seem’d, as at mine ease"
4864,CANTO XXXI,I mark’d him stooping. I were fain at times
4865,CANTO XXXI,"T’ have pass’d another way. Yet in th’ abyss,"
4866,CANTO XXXI,"That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,"
4867,CANTO XXXI,"Lightly he plac’d us; nor there leaning stay’d,"
4868,CANTO XXXI,But rose as in a bark the stately mast.
4869,CANTO XXXI,
4870,CANTO XXXI,
4871,CANTO XXXI,
4872,CANTO XXXI,
4873,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
4874,CANTO XXXII,
4875,CANTO XXXII,
4876,CANTO XXXII,"Could I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit"
4877,CANTO XXXII,"That hole of sorrow, o’er which ev’ry rock"
4878,CANTO XXXII,"His firm abutment rears, then might the vein"
4879,CANTO XXXII,Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine
4880,CANTO XXXII,"Such measures, and with falt’ring awe I touch"
4881,CANTO XXXII,The mighty theme; for to describe the depth
4882,CANTO XXXII,"Of all the universe, is no emprize"
4883,CANTO XXXII,"To jest with, and demands a tongue not us’d"
4884,CANTO XXXII,To infant babbling. But let them assist
4885,CANTO XXXII,"My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid"
4886,CANTO XXXII,"Amphion wall’d in Thebes, so with the truth"
4887,CANTO XXXII,"My speech shall best accord. Oh ill-starr’d folk,"
4888,CANTO XXXII,Beyond all others wretched! who abide
4889,CANTO XXXII,"In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words"
4890,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of, better had ye here on earth"
4891,CANTO XXXII,Been flocks or mountain goats. As down we stood
4892,CANTO XXXII,"In the dark pit beneath the giants’ feet,"
4893,CANTO XXXII,"But lower far than they, and I did gaze"
4894,CANTO XXXII,"Still on the lofty battlement, a voice"
4895,CANTO XXXII,Bespoke me thus: “Look how thou walkest. Take
4896,CANTO XXXII,"Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads"
4897,CANTO XXXII,"Of thy poor brethren.” Thereupon I turn’d,"
4898,CANTO XXXII,And saw before and underneath my feet
4899,CANTO XXXII,"A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem’d"
4900,CANTO XXXII,To glass than water. Not so thick a veil
4901,CANTO XXXII,In winter e’er hath Austrian Danube spread
4902,CANTO XXXII,"O’er his still course, nor Tanais far remote"
4903,CANTO XXXII,Under the chilling sky. Roll’d o’er that mass
4904,CANTO XXXII,"Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall’n,"
4905,CANTO XXXII,
4906,CANTO XXXII,Not e’en its rim had creak’d. As peeps the frog
4907,CANTO XXXII,"Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams"
4908,CANTO XXXII,"The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,"
4909,CANTO XXXII,"So, to where modest shame appears, thus low"
4910,CANTO XXXII,"Blue pinch’d and shrin’d in ice the spirits stood,"
4911,CANTO XXXII,Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
4912,CANTO XXXII,"His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,"
4913,CANTO XXXII,Their eyes express’d the dolour of their heart.
4914,CANTO XXXII,
4915,CANTO XXXII,"A space I look’d around, then at my feet"
4916,CANTO XXXII,"Saw two so strictly join’d, that of their head"
4917,CANTO XXXII,"The very hairs were mingled. “Tell me ye,"
4918,CANTO XXXII,"Whose bosoms thus together press,” said I,"
4919,CANTO XXXII,"“Who are ye?” At that sound their necks they bent,"
4920,CANTO XXXII,"And when their looks were lifted up to me,"
4921,CANTO XXXII,"Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,"
4922,CANTO XXXII,"Distill’d upon their lips, and the frost bound"
4923,CANTO XXXII,The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
4924,CANTO XXXII,Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos’d up
4925,CANTO XXXII,So stoutly. Whence like two enraged goats
4926,CANTO XXXII,They clash’d together; them such fury seiz’d.
4927,CANTO XXXII,
4928,CANTO XXXII,"And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,"
4929,CANTO XXXII,"Exclaim’d, still looking downward: “Why on us"
4930,CANTO XXXII,Dost speculate so long? If thou wouldst know
4931,CANTO XXXII,"Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave"
4932,CANTO XXXII,"Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own"
4933,CANTO XXXII,"Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves."
4934,CANTO XXXII,They from one body issued; and throughout
4935,CANTO XXXII,"Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade"
4936,CANTO XXXII,"More worthy in congealment to be fix’d,"
4937,CANTO XXXII,"Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur’s land"
4938,CANTO XXXII,"At that one blow dissever’d, not Focaccia,"
4939,CANTO XXXII,"No not this spirit, whose o’erjutting head"
4940,CANTO XXXII,Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name
4941,CANTO XXXII,"Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,"
4942,CANTO XXXII,Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
4943,CANTO XXXII,"All further question, in my form behold"
4944,CANTO XXXII,What once was Camiccione. I await
4945,CANTO XXXII,"Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt"
4946,CANTO XXXII,Shall wash out mine.” A thousand visages
4947,CANTO XXXII,"Then mark’d I, which the keen and eager cold"
4948,CANTO XXXII,Had shap’d into a doggish grin; whence creeps
4949,CANTO XXXII,"A shiv’ring horror o’er me, at the thought"
4950,CANTO XXXII,Of those frore shallows. While we journey’d on
4951,CANTO XXXII,"Toward the middle, at whose point unites"
4952,CANTO XXXII,"All heavy substance, and I trembling went"
4953,CANTO XXXII,"Through that eternal chillness, I know not"
4954,CANTO XXXII,"If will it were or destiny, or chance,"
4955,CANTO XXXII,"But, passing ’midst the heads, my foot did strike"
4956,CANTO XXXII,With violent blow against the face of one.
4957,CANTO XXXII,
4958,CANTO XXXII,"“Wherefore dost bruise me?” weeping, he exclaim’d,"
4959,CANTO XXXII,“Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
4960,CANTO XXXII,"For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?”"
4961,CANTO XXXII,
4962,CANTO XXXII,"I thus: “Instructor, now await me here,"
4963,CANTO XXXII,That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
4964,CANTO XXXII,"Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.” The teacher paus’d,"
4965,CANTO XXXII,"And to that shade I spake, who bitterly"
4966,CANTO XXXII,"Still curs’d me in his wrath. “What art thou, speak,"
4967,CANTO XXXII,That railest thus on others?” He replied:
4968,CANTO XXXII,"“Now who art thou, that smiting others’ cheeks"
4969,CANTO XXXII,"Through Antenora roamest, with such force"
4970,CANTO XXXII,"As were past suff’rance, wert thou living still?”"
4971,CANTO XXXII,
4972,CANTO XXXII,"“And I am living, to thy joy perchance,”"
4973,CANTO XXXII,"Was my reply, “if fame be dear to thee,"
4974,CANTO XXXII,That with the rest I may thy name enrol.”
4975,CANTO XXXII,
4976,CANTO XXXII,"“The contrary of what I covet most,”"
4977,CANTO XXXII,"Said he, “thou tender’st: hence; nor vex me more."
4978,CANTO XXXII,Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.”
4979,CANTO XXXII,
4980,CANTO XXXII,"Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:"
4981,CANTO XXXII,"“Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.”"
4982,CANTO XXXII,
4983,CANTO XXXII,"“Rend all away,” he answer’d, “yet for that"
4984,CANTO XXXII,"I will not tell nor show thee who I am,"
4985,CANTO XXXII,Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times.”
4986,CANTO XXXII,
4987,CANTO XXXII,"Now I had grasp’d his tresses, and stript off"
4988,CANTO XXXII,"More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes"
4989,CANTO XXXII,"Drawn in and downward, when another cried,"
4990,CANTO XXXII,"“What ails thee, Bocca? Sound not loud enough"
4991,CANTO XXXII,"Thy chatt’ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?"
4992,CANTO XXXII,"What devil wrings thee?”—“Now,” said I, “be dumb,"
4993,CANTO XXXII,Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
4994,CANTO XXXII,"True tidings will I bear.”—“Off,” he replied,"
4995,CANTO XXXII,“Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence
4996,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,"
4997,CANTO XXXII,Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman’s gold.
4998,CANTO XXXII,"‘Him of Duera,’ thou canst say, ‘I mark’d,"
4999,CANTO XXXII,Where the starv’d sinners pine.’ If thou be ask’d
5000,CANTO XXXII,"What other shade was with them, at thy side"
5001,CANTO XXXII,"Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain’d"
5002,CANTO XXXII,"The biting axe of Florence. Farther on,"
5003,CANTO XXXII,"If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,"
5004,CANTO XXXII,"With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him"
5005,CANTO XXXII,Who op’d Faenza when the people slept.”
5006,CANTO XXXII,
5007,CANTO XXXII,"We now had left him, passing on our way,"
5008,CANTO XXXII,When I beheld two spirits by the ice
5009,CANTO XXXII,"Pent in one hollow, that the head of one"
5010,CANTO XXXII,Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
5011,CANTO XXXII,"Is raven’d up through hunger, th’ uppermost"
5012,CANTO XXXII,"Did so apply his fangs to th’ other’s brain,"
5013,CANTO XXXII,Where the spine joins it. Not more furiously
5014,CANTO XXXII,"On Menalippus’ temples Tydeus gnaw’d,"
5015,CANTO XXXII,Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
5016,CANTO XXXII,
5017,CANTO XXXII,“O thou who show’st so beastly sign of hate
5018,CANTO XXXII,"’Gainst him thou prey’st on, let me hear,” said I"
5019,CANTO XXXII,"“The cause, on such condition, that if right"
5020,CANTO XXXII,"Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,"
5021,CANTO XXXII,"And what the colour of his sinning was,"
5022,CANTO XXXII,"I may repay thee in the world above,"
5023,CANTO XXXII,"If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long.”"
5024,CANTO XXXII,
5025,CANTO XXXII,
5026,CANTO XXXII,
5027,CANTO XXXII,
5028,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
5029,CANTO XXXIII,
5030,CANTO XXXIII,
5031,CANTO XXXIII,"His jaws uplifting from their fell repast,"
5032,CANTO XXXIII,"That sinner wip’d them on the hairs o’ th’ head,"
5033,CANTO XXXIII,"Which he behind had mangled, then began:"
5034,CANTO XXXIII,"“Thy will obeying, I call up afresh"
5035,CANTO XXXIII,"Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings"
5036,CANTO XXXIII,"My heart, or ere I tell on’t. But if words,"
5037,CANTO XXXIII,"That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear"
5038,CANTO XXXIII,"Fruit of eternal infamy to him,"
5039,CANTO XXXIII,"The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once"
5040,CANTO XXXIII,Shalt see me speak and weep. Who thou mayst be
5041,CANTO XXXIII,"I know not, nor how here below art come:"
5042,CANTO XXXIII,"But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,"
5043,CANTO XXXIII,When I do hear thee. Know I was on earth
5044,CANTO XXXIII,"Count Ugolino, and th’ Archbishop he"
5045,CANTO XXXIII,"Ruggieri. Why I neighbour him so close,"
5046,CANTO XXXIII,Now list. That through effect of his ill thoughts
5047,CANTO XXXIII,"In him my trust reposing, I was ta’en"
5048,CANTO XXXIII,"And after murder’d, need is not I tell."
5049,CANTO XXXIII,"What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,"
5050,CANTO XXXIII,"How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,"
5051,CANTO XXXIII,And know if he have wrong’d me. A small grate
5052,CANTO XXXIII,"Within that mew, which for my sake the name"
5053,CANTO XXXIII,"Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,"
5054,CANTO XXXIII,Already through its opening sev’ral moons
5055,CANTO XXXIII,"Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,"
5056,CANTO XXXIII,That from the future tore the curtain off.
5057,CANTO XXXIII,"This one, methought, as master of the sport,"
5058,CANTO XXXIII,Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
5059,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight"
5060,CANTO XXXIII,Of Lucca to the Pisan. With lean brachs
5061,CANTO XXXIII,"Inquisitive and keen, before him rang’d"
5062,CANTO XXXIII,Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
5063,CANTO XXXIII,After short course the father and the sons
5064,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem’d tir’d and lagging, and methought I saw"
5065,CANTO XXXIII,The sharp tusks gore their sides. When I awoke
5066,CANTO XXXIII,"Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard"
5067,CANTO XXXIII,My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
5068,CANTO XXXIII,"For bread. Right cruel art thou, if no pang"
5069,CANTO XXXIII,Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
5070,CANTO XXXIII,"And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?"
5071,CANTO XXXIII,Now had they waken’d; and the hour drew near
5072,CANTO XXXIII,When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
5073,CANTO XXXIII,"Of each misgave him through his dream, and I"
5074,CANTO XXXIII,"Heard, at its outlet underneath lock’d up"
5075,CANTO XXXIII,The’ horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
5076,CANTO XXXIII,I look’d upon the visage of my sons.
5077,CANTO XXXIII,I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
5078,CANTO XXXIII,"They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:"
5079,CANTO XXXIII,“Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?” Yet
5080,CANTO XXXIII,"I shed no tear, nor answer’d all that day"
5081,CANTO XXXIII,"Nor the next night, until another sun"
5082,CANTO XXXIII,Came out upon the world. When a faint beam
5083,CANTO XXXIII,"Had to our doleful prison made its way,"
5084,CANTO XXXIII,And in four countenances I descry’d
5085,CANTO XXXIII,"The image of my own, on either hand"
5086,CANTO XXXIII,"Through agony I bit, and they who thought"
5087,CANTO XXXIII,"I did it through desire of feeding, rose"
5088,CANTO XXXIII,"O’ th’ sudden, and cried, ‘Father, we should grieve"
5089,CANTO XXXIII,"Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav’st"
5090,CANTO XXXIII,"These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,"
5091,CANTO XXXIII,
5092,CANTO XXXIII,‘And do thou strip them off from us again.’
5093,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down"
5094,CANTO XXXIII,My spirit in stillness. That day and the next
5095,CANTO XXXIII,"We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth!"
5096,CANTO XXXIII,Why open’dst not upon us? When we came
5097,CANTO XXXIII,"To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet"
5098,CANTO XXXIII,"Outstretch’d did fling him, crying, ‘Hast no help"
5099,CANTO XXXIII,"For me, my father!’ There he died, and e’en"
5100,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three"
5101,CANTO XXXIII,Fall one by one ’twixt the fifth day and sixth:
5102,CANTO XXXIII,
5103,CANTO XXXIII,“Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
5104,CANTO XXXIII,"Over them all, and for three days aloud"
5105,CANTO XXXIII,Call’d on them who were dead. Then fasting got
5106,CANTO XXXIII,"The mastery of grief.” Thus having spoke,"
5107,CANTO XXXIII,
5108,CANTO XXXIII,Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
5109,CANTO XXXIII,"He fasten’d, like a mastiff’s ’gainst the bone"
5110,CANTO XXXIII,Firm and unyielding. Oh thou Pisa! shame
5111,CANTO XXXIII,"Of all the people, who their dwelling make"
5112,CANTO XXXIII,"In that fair region, where th’ Italian voice"
5113,CANTO XXXIII,"Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack"
5114,CANTO XXXIII,"To punish, from their deep foundations rise"
5115,CANTO XXXIII,"Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up"
5116,CANTO XXXIII,"The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee"
5117,CANTO XXXIII,May perish in the waters! What if fame
5118,CANTO XXXIII,Reported that thy castles were betray’d
5119,CANTO XXXIII,"By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou"
5120,CANTO XXXIII,"To stretch his children on the rack. For them,"
5121,CANTO XXXIII,"Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair"
5122,CANTO XXXIII,"Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,"
5123,CANTO XXXIII,"Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make"
5124,CANTO XXXIII,"Uncapable of guilt. Onward we pass’d,"
5125,CANTO XXXIII,Where others skarf’d in rugged folds of ice
5126,CANTO XXXIII,"Not on their feet were turn’d, but each revers’d."
5127,CANTO XXXIII,
5128,CANTO XXXIII,There very weeping suffers not to weep;
5129,CANTO XXXIII,For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
5130,CANTO XXXIII,"Impediment, and rolling inward turns"
5131,CANTO XXXIII,For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
5132,CANTO XXXIII,"Hang cluster’d, and like crystal vizors show,"
5133,CANTO XXXIII,Under the socket brimming all the cup.
5134,CANTO XXXIII,
5135,CANTO XXXIII,Now though the cold had from my face dislodg’d
5136,CANTO XXXIII,"Each feeling, as ’t were callous, yet me seem’d"
5137,CANTO XXXIII,"Some breath of wind I felt. “Whence cometh this,”"
5138,CANTO XXXIII,"Said I, “my master? Is not here below"
5139,CANTO XXXIII,"All vapour quench’d?”—“‘Thou shalt be speedily,”"
5140,CANTO XXXIII,"He answer’d, “where thine eye shall tell thee whence"
5141,CANTO XXXIII,The cause descrying of this airy shower.”
5142,CANTO XXXIII,
5143,CANTO XXXIII,Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn’d:
5144,CANTO XXXIII,“O souls so cruel! that the farthest post
5145,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath been assign’d you, from this face remove"
5146,CANTO XXXIII,"The harden’d veil, that I may vent the grief"
5147,CANTO XXXIII,"Impregnate at my heart, some little space"
5148,CANTO XXXIII,Ere it congeal again!” I thus replied:
5149,CANTO XXXIII,"“Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;"
5150,CANTO XXXIII,"And if I extricate thee not, far down"
5151,CANTO XXXIII,As to the lowest ice may I descend!”
5152,CANTO XXXIII,
5153,CANTO XXXIII,"“The friar Alberigo,” answered he,"
5154,CANTO XXXIII,"“Am I, who from the evil garden pluck’d"
5155,CANTO XXXIII,"Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date"
5156,CANTO XXXIII,"More luscious for my fig.”—“Hah!” I exclaim’d,"
5157,CANTO XXXIII,“Art thou too dead!”—“How in the world aloft
5158,CANTO XXXIII,"It fareth with my body,” answer’d he,"
5159,CANTO XXXIII,“I am right ignorant. Such privilege
5160,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul"
5161,CANTO XXXIII,"Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc’d."
5162,CANTO XXXIII,And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
5163,CANTO XXXIII,"The glazed tear-drops that o’erlay mine eyes,"
5164,CANTO XXXIII,"Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,"
5165,CANTO XXXIII,"As I did, yields her body to a fiend"
5166,CANTO XXXIII,"Who after moves and governs it at will,"
5167,CANTO XXXIII,Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
5168,CANTO XXXIII,Falls to this cistern. And perchance above
5169,CANTO XXXIII,"Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,"
5170,CANTO XXXIII,"Who here behind me winters. Him thou know’st,"
5171,CANTO XXXIII,If thou but newly art arriv’d below.
5172,CANTO XXXIII,"The years are many that have pass’d away,"
5173,CANTO XXXIII,Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.”
5174,CANTO XXXIII,
5175,CANTO XXXIII,"“Now,” answer’d I, “methinks thou mockest me,"
5176,CANTO XXXIII,"For Branca Doria never yet hath died,"
5177,CANTO XXXIII,"But doth all natural functions of a man,"
5178,CANTO XXXIII,"Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on.”"
5179,CANTO XXXIII,
5180,CANTO XXXIII,He thus: “Not yet unto that upper foss
5181,CANTO XXXIII,"By th’ evil talons guarded, where the pitch"
5182,CANTO XXXIII,"Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach’d,"
5183,CANTO XXXIII,When this one left a demon in his stead
5184,CANTO XXXIII,"In his own body, and of one his kin,"
5185,CANTO XXXIII,Who with him treachery wrought. But now put forth
5186,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.” I op’d them not."
5187,CANTO XXXIII,Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
5188,CANTO XXXIII,
5189,CANTO XXXIII,"Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,"
5190,CANTO XXXIII,"With every foulness stain’d, why from the earth"
5191,CANTO XXXIII,Are ye not cancel’d? Such an one of yours
5192,CANTO XXXIII,"I with Romagna’s darkest spirit found,"
5193,CANTO XXXIII,As for his doings even now in soul
5194,CANTO XXXIII,"Is in Cocytus plung’d, and yet doth seem"
5195,CANTO XXXIII,In body still alive upon the earth.
5196,CANTO XXXIII,
5197,CANTO XXXIII,
5198,CANTO XXXIII,
5199,CANTO XXXIII,
5200,CANTO XXXIV,CANTO XXXIV
5201,CANTO XXXIV,
5202,CANTO XXXIV,
5203,CANTO XXXIV,“The banners of Hell’s Monarch do come forth
5204,CANTO XXXIV,"Towards us; therefore look,” so spake my guide,"
5205,CANTO XXXIV,"“If thou discern him.” As, when breathes a cloud"
5206,CANTO XXXIV,"Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night"
5207,CANTO XXXIV,"Fall on our hemisphere, seems view’d from far"
5208,CANTO XXXIV,"A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,"
5209,CANTO XXXIV,"Such was the fabric then methought I saw,"
5210,CANTO XXXIV,
5211,CANTO XXXIV,"To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew"
5212,CANTO XXXIV,Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
5213,CANTO XXXIV,
5214,CANTO XXXIV,Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
5215,CANTO XXXIV,Record the marvel) where the souls were all
5216,CANTO XXXIV,"Whelm’d underneath, transparent, as through glass"
5217,CANTO XXXIV,"Pellucid the frail stem. Some prone were laid,"
5218,CANTO XXXIV,"Others stood upright, this upon the soles,"
5219,CANTO XXXIV,"That on his head, a third with face to feet"
5220,CANTO XXXIV,"Arch’d like a bow. When to the point we came,"
5221,CANTO XXXIV,Whereat my guide was pleas’d that I should see
5222,CANTO XXXIV,"The creature eminent in beauty once,"
5223,CANTO XXXIV,He from before me stepp’d and made me pause.
5224,CANTO XXXIV,
5225,CANTO XXXIV,"“Lo!” he exclaim’d, “lo Dis! and lo the place,"
5226,CANTO XXXIV,Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.”
5227,CANTO XXXIV,
5228,CANTO XXXIV,"How frozen and how faint I then became,"
5229,CANTO XXXIV,"Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,"
5230,CANTO XXXIV,Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
5231,CANTO XXXIV,I was not dead nor living. Think thyself
5232,CANTO XXXIV,"If quick conception work in thee at all,"
5233,CANTO XXXIV,"How I did feel. That emperor, who sways"
5234,CANTO XXXIV,"The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th’ ice"
5235,CANTO XXXIV,Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
5236,CANTO XXXIV,"A giant, than the giants are in his arms."
5237,CANTO XXXIV,"Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits"
5238,CANTO XXXIV,With such a part. If he were beautiful
5239,CANTO XXXIV,"As he is hideous now, and yet did dare"
5240,CANTO XXXIV,"To scowl upon his Maker, well from him"
5241,CANTO XXXIV,May all our mis’ry flow. Oh what a sight!
5242,CANTO XXXIV,"How passing strange it seem’d, when I did spy"
5243,CANTO XXXIV,Upon his head three faces: one in front
5244,CANTO XXXIV,"Of hue vermilion, th’ other two with this"
5245,CANTO XXXIV,Midway each shoulder join’d and at the crest;
5246,CANTO XXXIV,The right ’twixt wan and yellow seem’d: the left
5247,CANTO XXXIV,"To look on, such as come from whence old Nile"
5248,CANTO XXXIV,Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth
5249,CANTO XXXIV,"Two mighty wings, enormous as became"
5250,CANTO XXXIV,A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw
5251,CANTO XXXIV,"Outstretch’d on the wide sea. No plumes had they,"
5252,CANTO XXXIV,"But were in texture like a bat, and these"
5253,CANTO XXXIV,"He flapp’d i’ th’ air, that from him issued still"
5254,CANTO XXXIV,"Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth"
5255,CANTO XXXIV,Was frozen. At six eyes he wept: the tears
5256,CANTO XXXIV,Adown three chins distill’d with bloody foam.
5257,CANTO XXXIV,At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ’d
5258,CANTO XXXIV,"Bruis’d as with pond’rous engine, so that three"
5259,CANTO XXXIV,Were in this guise tormented. But far more
5260,CANTO XXXIV,"Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang’d"
5261,CANTO XXXIV,"By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back"
5262,CANTO XXXIV,"Was stript of all its skin. “That upper spirit,"
5263,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hath worse punishment,” so spake my guide,"
5264,CANTO XXXIV,"“Is Judas, he that hath his head within"
5265,CANTO XXXIV,"And plies the feet without. Of th’ other two,"
5266,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw"
5267,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe"
5268,CANTO XXXIV,"And speaks not! Th’ other Cassius, that appears"
5269,CANTO XXXIV,"So large of limb. But night now re-ascends,"
5270,CANTO XXXIV,And it is time for parting. All is seen.”
5271,CANTO XXXIV,
5272,CANTO XXXIV,"I clipp’d him round the neck, for so he bade;"
5273,CANTO XXXIV,"And noting time and place, he, when the wings"
5274,CANTO XXXIV,"Enough were op’d, caught fast the shaggy sides,"
5275,CANTO XXXIV,And down from pile to pile descending stepp’d
5276,CANTO XXXIV,Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
5277,CANTO XXXIV,
5278,CANTO XXXIV,"Soon as he reach’d the point, whereat the thigh"
5279,CANTO XXXIV,"Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,"
5280,CANTO XXXIV,My leader there with pain and struggling hard
5281,CANTO XXXIV,"Turn’d round his head, where his feet stood before,"
5282,CANTO XXXIV,"And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,"
5283,CANTO XXXIV,That into hell methought we turn’d again.
5284,CANTO XXXIV,
5285,CANTO XXXIV,"“Expect that by such stairs as these,” thus spake"
5286,CANTO XXXIV,"The teacher, panting like a man forespent,"
5287,CANTO XXXIV,“We must depart from evil so extreme.”
5288,CANTO XXXIV,"Then at a rocky opening issued forth,"
5289,CANTO XXXIV,"And plac’d me on a brink to sit, next join’d"
5290,CANTO XXXIV,"With wary step my side. I rais’d mine eyes,"
5291,CANTO XXXIV,Believing that I Lucifer should see
5292,CANTO XXXIV,"Where he was lately left, but saw him now"
5293,CANTO XXXIV,"With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort,"
5294,CANTO XXXIV,"Who see not what the point was I had pass’d,"
5295,CANTO XXXIV,Bethink them if sore toil oppress’d me then.
5296,CANTO XXXIV,
5297,CANTO XXXIV,"“Arise,” my master cried, “upon thy feet."
5298,CANTO XXXIV,"The way is long, and much uncouth the road;"
5299,CANTO XXXIV,And now within one hour and half of noon
5300,CANTO XXXIV,The sun returns.” It was no palace-hall
5301,CANTO XXXIV,"Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,"
5302,CANTO XXXIV,But natural dungeon where ill footing was
5303,CANTO XXXIV,And scant supply of light. “Ere from th’ abyss
5304,CANTO XXXIV,"I sep’rate,” thus when risen I began,"
5305,CANTO XXXIV,“My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free
5306,CANTO XXXIV,From error’s thralldom. Where is now the ice?
5307,CANTO XXXIV,How standeth he in posture thus revers’d?
5308,CANTO XXXIV,And how from eve to morn in space so brief
5309,CANTO XXXIV,Hath the sun made his transit?” He in few
5310,CANTO XXXIV,Thus answering spake: “Thou deemest thou art still
5311,CANTO XXXIV,"On th’ other side the centre, where I grasp’d"
5312,CANTO XXXIV,"Th’ abhorred worm, that boreth through the world."
5313,CANTO XXXIV,"Thou wast on th’ other side, so long as I"
5314,CANTO XXXIV,"Descended; when I turn’d, thou didst o’erpass"
5315,CANTO XXXIV,"That point, to which from ev’ry part is dragg’d"
5316,CANTO XXXIV,All heavy substance. Thou art now arriv’d
5317,CANTO XXXIV,"Under the hemisphere opposed to that,"
5318,CANTO XXXIV,"Which the great continent doth overspread,"
5319,CANTO XXXIV,And underneath whose canopy expir’d
5320,CANTO XXXIV,"The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv’d."
5321,CANTO XXXIV,"Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,"
5322,CANTO XXXIV,Whose other aspect is Judecca. Morn
5323,CANTO XXXIV,"Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,"
5324,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose shaggy pile was scal’d, yet standeth fix’d,"
5325,CANTO XXXIV,As at the first. On this part he fell down
5326,CANTO XXXIV,"From heav’n; and th’ earth, here prominent before,"
5327,CANTO XXXIV,"Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,"
5328,CANTO XXXIV,And to our hemisphere retir’d. Perchance
5329,CANTO XXXIV,To shun him was the vacant space left here
5330,CANTO XXXIV,"By what of firm land on this side appears,"
5331,CANTO XXXIV,"That sprang aloof.” There is a place beneath,"
5332,CANTO XXXIV,"From Belzebub as distant, as extends"
5333,CANTO XXXIV,"The vaulted tomb, discover’d not by sight,"
5334,CANTO XXXIV,"But by the sound of brooklet, that descends"
5335,CANTO XXXIV,"This way along the hollow of a rock,"
5336,CANTO XXXIV,"Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,"
5337,CANTO XXXIV,The wave hath eaten. By that hidden way
5338,CANTO XXXIV,"My guide and I did enter, to return"
5339,CANTO XXXIV,To the fair world: and heedless of repose
5340,CANTO XXXIV,"We climbed, he first, I following his steps,"
5341,CANTO XXXIV,Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav’n
5342,CANTO XXXIV,Dawn’d through a circular opening in the cave:
5343,CANTO XXXIV,Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.
5344,CANTO XXXIV,
5345,CANTO XXXIV,
5346,CANTO XXXIV,
5347,CANTO XXXIV,
