93,ADVERTISEMENT.,"It is proposed to give, in these little volumes, some such introduction"
94,ADVERTISEMENT.,to the great writers of Greece and Rome as may open to those who have
95,ADVERTISEMENT.,not received a classical education--or in whose case it has been
96,ADVERTISEMENT.,incomplete and fragmentary--a fair acquaintance with the contents of
97,ADVERTISEMENT.,"their writings, and the leading features of their style."
98,ADVERTISEMENT.,
99,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The constant allusions in our own literature, and even in our daily"
100,ADVERTISEMENT.,"press, to the works of the ancient classical authors, and the"
101,ADVERTISEMENT.,familiarity with the whole _dramatis personæ_ of ancient history and
102,ADVERTISEMENT.,fable which modern writers on all subjects assume on the part of their
103,ADVERTISEMENT.,"readers, make such an acquaintance almost necessary for those who care"
104,ADVERTISEMENT.,not only to read but to understand.
105,ADVERTISEMENT.,
106,ADVERTISEMENT.,Even in the case of readers who have gone through the regular classical
107,ADVERTISEMENT.,"course in their day, this acquaintance, if honest confession were made,"
108,ADVERTISEMENT.,"would be found very imperfect. It is said, of course, that “every"
109,ADVERTISEMENT.,English gentleman reads Horace;” but this is one of those general
110,ADVERTISEMENT.,assertions which rest upon very loose ground. An ordinary observer of
111,ADVERTISEMENT.,the habits of the class might find himself somewhat at a loss for
112,ADVERTISEMENT.,instances.
113,ADVERTISEMENT.,
114,ADVERTISEMENT.,"In the case of ladies, and of the large body of general readers who have"
115,ADVERTISEMENT.,"received either no classical education, or a very imperfect one,"
116,ADVERTISEMENT.,"probably less is now known of Homer, Virgil, or Horace, than in the days"
117,ADVERTISEMENT.,"when Pope’s, Dryden’s, and Francis’s translations were first published,"
118,ADVERTISEMENT.,and took their place for the time on every literary table.
119,ADVERTISEMENT.,
120,ADVERTISEMENT.,"There appears a strong probability that the study of Greek and Latin,"
121,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which has so long been our exclusive idea of a “liberal” education, will"
122,ADVERTISEMENT.,hereafter be confined within a narrower circle. Yet some knowledge of
123,ADVERTISEMENT.,the ancient classics must continue to be the key to much of our best
124,ADVERTISEMENT.,"English literature. If, as some educational reformers suggest, a"
125,ADVERTISEMENT.,systematic course of English reading be substituted for Latin and Greek
126,ADVERTISEMENT.,"in our “middle-class” schools, such a training will necessarily involve"
127,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the careful study of the masters of English thought and style, and more"
128,ADVERTISEMENT.,especially of those earlier authors whose taste was formed very much
129,ADVERTISEMENT.,"upon the old classical models, and whose writings are full of allusions"
130,ADVERTISEMENT.,to their characters and imagery.
131,ADVERTISEMENT.,
132,ADVERTISEMENT.,It may be said that we have translations of all the best and most
133,ADVERTISEMENT.,"popular of the classical authors, and that many of these are admirable"
134,ADVERTISEMENT.,"in their execution. This is quite true. The Iliad, the Odyssey, the"
135,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Æneid, Horace, and some of the Greek Dramatists, have lately found"
136,ADVERTISEMENT.,"translators who, in point of taste and general accuracy, leave little to"
137,ADVERTISEMENT.,be desired. But the results of their work will be best enjoyed and
138,ADVERTISEMENT.,valued by those whose acquaintance with the originals enables them to
139,ADVERTISEMENT.,"appreciate not only the positive beauty of the English version, but its"
140,ADVERTISEMENT.,relative merit as conveying the spirit and sense of the Greek or Latin
141,ADVERTISEMENT.,author. Even the best translation (especially of the classical poets)
142,ADVERTISEMENT.,"may fail to have a continuous interest for the merely modern reader,"
143,ADVERTISEMENT.,"unless he has some previous familiarity with the argument of the work,"
144,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the personages introduced, and the characteristics of the age in which"
145,ADVERTISEMENT.,the scene and action lie.
146,ADVERTISEMENT.,
147,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The aim of the present series will be to explain, sufficiently for"
148,ADVERTISEMENT.,"general readers, who these great writers were, and what they wrote; to"
149,ADVERTISEMENT.,"give, wherever possible, some connected outline of the story which they"
150,ADVERTISEMENT.,"tell, or the facts which they record, checked by the results of modern"
151,ADVERTISEMENT.,investigations; to present some of their most striking passages in
152,ADVERTISEMENT.,"approved English translations, and to illustrate them generally from"
153,ADVERTISEMENT.,"modern writers; to serve, in short, as a popular retrospect of the chief"
154,ADVERTISEMENT.,"literature of Greece and Rome. The attempt appeals, as will be seen, to"
155,ADVERTISEMENT.,a circle outside that of classical scholarship; though possibly some who
156,ADVERTISEMENT.,"have all legal claim to rank as scholars, but who now stand rather on"
157,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the “retired list” of that service, may in these pages meet some old"
158,ADVERTISEMENT.,"acquaintances whom they have almost forgotten. If, in any case, they"
159,ADVERTISEMENT.,"find our re-introduction unsatisfactory, none would advise them more"
160,ADVERTISEMENT.,heartily than we do to renew the old personal intercourse for
161,ADVERTISEMENT.,themselves.

216,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
217,INTRODUCTION.,
218,INTRODUCTION.,
219,INTRODUCTION.,"It is quite unnecessary here to discuss the question, on which the"
220,INTRODUCTION.,"learned are very far from being agreed, whether Homer--the “Prince of"
221,INTRODUCTION.,Poets”--had any real existence; whether he was really the author of the
222,INTRODUCTION.,"two great poems which bear his name, or whether they are the collected"
223,INTRODUCTION.,"works of various hands, dovetailed into each other by some clever editor"
224,INTRODUCTION.,of ancient times. Homer will still retain his personality for the
225,INTRODUCTION.,"uncritical reader, however a sceptical criticism may question it. The"
226,INTRODUCTION.,"blind old bard, wandering from land to land, singing his lays of the old"
227,INTRODUCTION.,"heroic times to a throng of admiring listeners, must always continue to"
228,INTRODUCTION.,be the familiar notion of the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Such
229,INTRODUCTION.,was the universal creed of the world of readers until a comparatively
230,INTRODUCTION.,"recent date; and the speculations of modern scholars, in this as in"
231,INTRODUCTION.,"other cases, have been much more successful in shaking the popular"
232,INTRODUCTION.,belief than in replacing it by any constructive theory of their own
233,INTRODUCTION.,which is nearly so credible. “Homer” is quite as likely to have been
234,INTRODUCTION.,"really Homer, as a mere name under whose shadow the poems of various"
235,INTRODUCTION.,unknown writers have been grouped.
236,INTRODUCTION.,
237,INTRODUCTION.,"There is extant a Life of the poet, said to have been composed by the"
238,INTRODUCTION.,"Greek historian Herodotus, quoted as such by early writers, and"
239,INTRODUCTION.,"possibly, after all, quite as trustworthy as the destructive conjectures"
240,INTRODUCTION.,of those critics who would allow him no life at all. There we are told
241,INTRODUCTION.,"that his birth, like that of so many heroes of antiquity, was"
242,INTRODUCTION.,"illegitimate; that he was the son of Critheis, who had been betrayed by"
243,INTRODUCTION.,"her guardian; that he was born near Smyrna, on the banks of the river"
244,INTRODUCTION.,"Meles, and was thence called “Melesigenes.” His mother is said"
245,INTRODUCTION.,"afterwards to have married a schoolmaster named Phemius, by whom the boy"
246,INTRODUCTION.,"was adopted, and in due course succeeded to his new father’s occupation."
247,INTRODUCTION.,But the future bard soon grew weary of such confinement. He set out to
248,INTRODUCTION.,"see the world; visiting in turn Egypt, Italy, Spain, the islands of the"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"Mediterranean, and gathering material for at least one of his great"
250,INTRODUCTION.,"works, the adventures of the hero Odysseus (Ulysses), known to us as the"
251,INTRODUCTION.,"Odyssey. In the course of his travels he became blind, and thence was"
252,INTRODUCTION.,called “Homeros”--“the blind man”--such at least is one of the
253,INTRODUCTION.,interpretations of his name.[1] In that state returning to his native
254,INTRODUCTION.,"town of Smyrna, he, like his great English successor, Milton, composed"
255,INTRODUCTION.,his two great poems. One of the few passages in which any personal
256,INTRODUCTION.,"allusion to himself has been traced, or fancied, in Homer’s verse, is a"
257,INTRODUCTION.,"scene in the Odyssey, where the blind harper Demodocus is introduced as"
258,INTRODUCTION.,singing his lays in the halls of King Alcinous:--
259,INTRODUCTION.,
260,INTRODUCTION.,"“Whom the Muse loved, and gave him good and ill--"
261,INTRODUCTION.,"Ill, that of light she did his eyes deprive;"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"Good, that sweet minstrelsies divine at will"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"She lent him, and a voice men’s ears to thrill.” (W.)"
264,INTRODUCTION.,
265,INTRODUCTION.,"So, in the same poem, the only other bard who appears is also"
266,INTRODUCTION.,"blind--Phemius, who is compelled to exercise his art for the diversion"
267,INTRODUCTION.,of the dissolute suitors of Penelope. The fact of blindness is in itself
268,INTRODUCTION.,by no means incompatible with the notion of Homer’s having constructed
269,INTRODUCTION.,and recited even two such long poems as the Iliad and the Odyssey. The
270,INTRODUCTION.,"blind have very frequently remarkable memories, together with a ready"
271,INTRODUCTION.,ear and passionate love for music.
272,INTRODUCTION.,
273,INTRODUCTION.,"For the rest of his life, Homer is said to have roamed from city to city"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"as a wandering minstrel, singing his lays through the towns of Asia"
275,INTRODUCTION.,"Minor, in the islands of the Archipelago, and even in the streets of"
276,INTRODUCTION.,"Athens itself, and drawing crowds of eager listeners wherever he went by"
277,INTRODUCTION.,the wondrous charm of his song. This wandering life has been assumed to
278,INTRODUCTION.,imply that he was an outcast and poor. The uncertainty of his
279,INTRODUCTION.,"birthplace, and the disputes to which it gave rise in after times, were"
280,INTRODUCTION.,the subject of an epigram whose pungency passed for truth--
281,INTRODUCTION.,
282,INTRODUCTION.,"“Seven rival towns contend for Homer dead,"
283,INTRODUCTION.,Through which the living Homer begged his bread.”
284,INTRODUCTION.,
285,INTRODUCTION.,"But the begging is not in the original lines at all, and a wandering"
286,INTRODUCTION.,"minstrel was no dishonoured guest, wherever he appeared, in days much"
287,INTRODUCTION.,later than Homer’s. Somewhere on the coast of the Levant he died and
288,INTRODUCTION.,"was buried, leaving behind him that name which retains its spell hardly"
289,INTRODUCTION.,"weakened by the lapse of some twenty-seven centuries, and the two great"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"poems which have been confessedly the main source of the epic poetry,"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"the heroic drama, and the early romance of Europe."
292,INTRODUCTION.,
293,INTRODUCTION.,Other works are ascribed to Homer’s name besides the Iliad and the
294,INTRODUCTION.,"Odyssey, but the authorship appears more doubtful. If we trust the"
295,INTRODUCTION.,"opinion of Aristotle, Homer was the father of comic narrative poetry as"
296,INTRODUCTION.,"well as of epic. The poem called ‘Margites,’ attributed to him,"
297,INTRODUCTION.,contained the travels and adventures of a wealthy and pedantic coxcomb:
298,INTRODUCTION.,but slight fragments only of this have been preserved--enough to show
299,INTRODUCTION.,that the humour was somewhat more gross than one would expect from the
300,INTRODUCTION.,"poet of the Odyssey, though redeemed, no doubt, by satire of a higher"
301,INTRODUCTION.,"kind, as in the surviving line which, in describing the hero’s"
302,INTRODUCTION.,"accomplishments, seems to anticipate the multifarious and somewhat"
303,INTRODUCTION.,superficial knowledge of the present day--
304,INTRODUCTION.,
305,INTRODUCTION.,“Full many things he knew--and ill he knew them all.”
306,INTRODUCTION.,
307,INTRODUCTION.,"Admitting the personality of the poet himself, and his claim to the"
308,INTRODUCTION.,"authorship of both Iliad and Odyssey, it is not necessary to suppose"
309,INTRODUCTION.,"that either poem was framed originally as a whole, or recited as a whole"
310,INTRODUCTION.,upon every occasion. No doubt the song grew as he sung. He would
311,INTRODUCTION.,"probably add from time to time to the original lay. The reciter, whose"
312,INTRODUCTION.,"audience must depend entirely upon him for their text, has an almost"
313,INTRODUCTION.,unlimited licence of interpolation and expansion. It may be fairly
314,INTRODUCTION.,"granted also that future minstrels, who sung the great poet’s lays"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"after his death, would interweave with them here and there something of"
316,INTRODUCTION.,"their own, more or less successful in its imitation of the original."
317,INTRODUCTION.,Such explanation of the repetitions and incongruities which are to be
318,INTRODUCTION.,found in the Iliad seems at least as reasonable as the supposition that
319,INTRODUCTION.,"its twenty-four books are the work of various hands, “stitched"
320,INTRODUCTION.,together”--such is one explanation of the term “rhapsody”--in after
321,INTRODUCTION.,"times, and having a common origin only in this, that all sung of the"
322,INTRODUCTION.,“wondrous Tale of Troy.”
323,INTRODUCTION.,
324,INTRODUCTION.,"That tale was for generations the mainspring of Greek legend and song,"
325,INTRODUCTION.,"and the inspiration of Greek painters and sculptors. At this day, the"
326,INTRODUCTION.,"attempt to separate the fabulous from the real, to reduce the rich"
327,INTRODUCTION.,"colouring of romance into the severe outlines of history, is a task"
328,INTRODUCTION.,which even in the ablest hands seems hopeless. The legends themselves
329,INTRODUCTION.,"are various, and contradictory in their details. The leading characters"
330,INTRODUCTION.,"in the story--Priam, Helen, Agamemnon, Achilles, Ulysses, Paris, Hector"
331,INTRODUCTION.,and Andromache--appear in as many different aspects and relations as the
332,INTRODUCTION.,fancy of each poet chose. In this respect they are like the heroes of
333,INTRODUCTION.,"our own “Round Table” romances; like Arthur and Guinevere, Lancelot,"
334,INTRODUCTION.,"Tristram, and Percival--common impersonations on whom all kinds of"
335,INTRODUCTION.,"adventures are fastened, though the main characteristics of the portrait"
336,INTRODUCTION.,are preserved throughout. What amount of bare historical truth may or
337,INTRODUCTION.,may not underlie the poetical colouring--whether there was or was not a
338,INTRODUCTION.,"real Greek expedition and a real siege of Troy, less “heroic” and more"
339,INTRODUCTION.,probable in its extent and details than the Iliad represents it--is no
340,INTRODUCTION.,question to be here discussed. So far as literary interest is
341,INTRODUCTION.,"concerned, “the real Trojan war,” as Mr Grote well says, “is that which"
342,INTRODUCTION.,is recounted by Homer.” It will be sufficient here to take the poet as
343,INTRODUCTION.,"our main authority, and to fill up his picture from other legendary"
344,INTRODUCTION.,sources; for though Homer’s version of the Great Trojan War is the
345,INTRODUCTION.,"earliest account which has come down to us, he drew his material from"
346,INTRODUCTION.,"still earlier lays and legends, with which he assumes all his readers"
347,INTRODUCTION.,"(or hearers) to be tolerably familiar; and which, again, the later poets"
348,INTRODUCTION.,and tragedians reproduced with many additions and variations of their
349,INTRODUCTION.,own.
350,INTRODUCTION.,
351,INTRODUCTION.,The preservation of poems of such great length (the Iliad alone contains
352,INTRODUCTION.,"between fifteen and sixteen thousand lines) in days when writing, even"
353,INTRODUCTION.,"if invented, was in its infancy, has been the subject of much"
354,INTRODUCTION.,speculation. That they were publicly recited at great national festivals
355,INTRODUCTION.,"in all parts of Greece, is undoubted. Professional minstrels, or"
356,INTRODUCTION.,"“rhapsodists,” as they were called, chanted certain selected portions"
357,INTRODUCTION.,which suited their own taste or that of their audience--often such as
358,INTRODUCTION.,contained the exploits of some national hero. They followed possibly in
359,INTRODUCTION.,this the example of the great bard himself; just as certain of our own
360,INTRODUCTION.,"popular writers have lately taken to read, to an admiring public, some"
361,INTRODUCTION.,favourite scenes and chapters from their own works. Lycurgus is said to
362,INTRODUCTION.,"have brought the collected poems from Asia to Sparta; Solon, at Athens,"
363,INTRODUCTION.,to have first obliged the minstrels to recite the several portions in
364,INTRODUCTION.,"due order, so as to preserve the continuity of the narrative."
365,INTRODUCTION.,"Pisistratus, the great Athenian ruler, has the reputation of having"
366,INTRODUCTION.,"first reduced the whole into a collected shape, and of having thus far"
367,INTRODUCTION.,"settled the “text” of Homer, employing in this work the most eminent"
368,INTRODUCTION.,men of letters of his day. There is a legend of a Homeric ‘Septuagint:’
369,INTRODUCTION.,"of seventy learned scribes employed in the great work, as in the Greek"
370,INTRODUCTION.,version of the Hebrew Scriptures. From the time when the Iliad and
371,INTRODUCTION.,"Odyssey were reduced to writing, their popularity rather increased than"
372,INTRODUCTION.,"waned. They were the storehouse of Greek history, genealogy, and"
373,INTRODUCTION.,antiquity--the models and standards of literary taste. To be
374,INTRODUCTION.,"unacquainted with these masterpieces, was to be wholly without culture"
375,INTRODUCTION.,"and education: and, thanks to their continual and public recital, this"
376,INTRODUCTION.,want was perhaps less prevalent amongst the Greeks than amongst
377,INTRODUCTION.,"ourselves. The young Alcibiades, when receiving the usual education of a"
378,INTRODUCTION.,"Greek gentleman, is said to have struck his tutor one day in a burst of"
379,INTRODUCTION.,"righteous indignation, for having made the confession--certainly"
380,INTRODUCTION.,inexcusable in his vocation--that he did not possess a copy of the great
381,INTRODUCTION.,poet. Alexander the Great carried always with him the copy which had
382,INTRODUCTION.,"been corrected by his master Aristotle, preserved in a jewelled casket"
383,INTRODUCTION.,taken amongst the spoils of Darius. No pains were spared in the
384,INTRODUCTION.,"caligraphy, or costliness in the mountings, of favourite manuscripts of"
385,INTRODUCTION.,the Homeric poems. They continued to be regarded with almost a
386,INTRODUCTION.,superstitious reverence even during the middle ages of Christendom.
387,INTRODUCTION.,"Men’s future destinies were discovered, by a sort of rude divination, in"
388,INTRODUCTION.,verses selected at hap-hazard. Fantastic writers saw in the two poems
389,INTRODUCTION.,nothing more or less than allegorical versions of Hebrew history; and
390,INTRODUCTION.,grave physicians recommended as an infallible recipe for a _quartan_
391,INTRODUCTION.,"ague, the placing every night a copy of the _fourth_ book of the Iliad"
392,INTRODUCTION.,under the patient’s head. Modern critical speculations have gone quite
393,INTRODUCTION.,"as far in another direction. In the eyes of some ingenious theorists,"
394,INTRODUCTION.,this siege of Troy is but “a repetition of the daily siege of the East
395,INTRODUCTION.,by the solar powers that every evening are robbed of their brightest
396,INTRODUCTION.,treasures in the West;”[2] and the Homeric heroes and their exploits all
397,INTRODUCTION.,"represent allegorically, in one form or another, the great conflict"
398,INTRODUCTION.,between Light and Darkness. But such questions are beyond the scope of
399,INTRODUCTION.,these pages; we are content here to take the tale of Troy as the poet
400,INTRODUCTION.,tells it.
401,INTRODUCTION.,
402,INTRODUCTION.,The supposed date of the story may be taken as some fifteen centuries
403,INTRODUCTION.,"before the Christian era. The great City of Troy, or Ilium, lay on the"
404,INTRODUCTION.,coast of Asia Minor--its reputed site still bearing the name of the
405,INTRODUCTION.,"Troad, a broad well-watered champaign, with a height still recognised as"
406,INTRODUCTION.,"the citadel towering above it. “No royal seat of the ancient world,”"
407,INTRODUCTION.,"says a modern visitor to the spot, “could boast a grander situation than"
408,INTRODUCTION.,"the Trojan citadel.”[3] As to its actual locality and existence, there"
409,INTRODUCTION.,is little ground for scepticism. The tradition of the name and place was
410,INTRODUCTION.,"unbroken in the early historical ages of Greece. Xerxes, king of Persia,"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"in his expedition, is said to have visited the citadel, and to have"
412,INTRODUCTION.,"offered there a thousand oxen to the tutelary goddess; possibly, it has"
413,INTRODUCTION.,"been suggested, claiming to be the avenger of the Asiatic kings on their"
414,INTRODUCTION.,"European enemies.[4] Mindarus, the Lacedæmonian admiral, seventy years"
415,INTRODUCTION.,"later, sacrificed there also: and Alexander, when he crossed the"
416,INTRODUCTION.,"Hellespont, not only did the same, but took from the temple some of the"
417,INTRODUCTION.,sacred arms which were hung there (said to be those of the heroes of
418,INTRODUCTION.,"the great siege), offering up his own in exchange. The founder of the"
419,INTRODUCTION.,"city was Ilus, son of Tros, and from these mythical heroes it took its"
420,INTRODUCTION.,"two names. But its walls were built by the grandson, Laomedon. He"
421,INTRODUCTION.,employed some remarkable workmen. In one of the most striking and
422,INTRODUCTION.,"suggestive fables of the Greek mythology, certain of the gods are"
423,INTRODUCTION.,represented as being condemned by Zeus (or Jupiter) to a period of
424,INTRODUCTION.,servitude upon earth. Poseidon (Neptune) and Apollo were under this
425,INTRODUCTION.,"condemnation, and undertook, for certain rewards, to help Laomedon in"
426,INTRODUCTION.,"his fortifications. But when the work was finished, the ungrateful king"
427,INTRODUCTION.,"repudiated his bargain. As a punishment, a sea-monster is sent to ravage"
428,INTRODUCTION.,"his dominions, who can only be appeased by the sacrifice of a maiden of"
429,INTRODUCTION.,"noble blood. The lot falls upon the king’s own daughter, Hesione. It is"
430,INTRODUCTION.,the original version of St George and the Dragon. Laomedon offers his
431,INTRODUCTION.,"daughter, and certain horses of immortal breed (which he seems to count"
432,INTRODUCTION.,"even a more valuable prize), to the champion who will deliver her and"
433,INTRODUCTION.,slay the monster. Hercules comes to the rescue; but a second time
434,INTRODUCTION.,"Laomedon breaks his word. He substitutes mortal horses, and refuses his"
435,INTRODUCTION.,"daughter. Hercules attacks the city, kills Laomedon, and carries off the"
436,INTRODUCTION.,"princess Hesione, whom he gives to his comrade Telamon. From this union"
437,INTRODUCTION.,"are born two heroes, Ajax and his brother Teucer, whom we shall meet in"
438,INTRODUCTION.,"the second and great Siege of Troy, which forms the subject of Homer’s"
439,INTRODUCTION.,Iliad.
440,INTRODUCTION.,
441,INTRODUCTION.,This double perjury of Laomedon’s is one supposed cause of the wrath of
442,INTRODUCTION.,"Heaven resting on the town and its people. Yet Apollo, forgetful, it"
443,INTRODUCTION.,"would seem, of his former unworthy treatment, and only remembering with"
444,INTRODUCTION.,"affection the walls which he had helped to build, is represented as"
445,INTRODUCTION.,"taking part with the Trojans in the great struggle, in which the deities"
446,INTRODUCTION.,of Olympus are bitterly divided amongst themselves.
447,INTRODUCTION.,
448,INTRODUCTION.,But Homer’s Tale of Troy says nothing of Laomedon and his broken faith.
449,INTRODUCTION.,His poem is built upon a later legend. This legend embraces in the whole
450,INTRODUCTION.,"a period of thirty years, divided exactly, in a manner very convenient"
451,INTRODUCTION.,"for both poet and reader, into complete decades; ten years of"
452,INTRODUCTION.,"preparation for the siege, ten occupied in the siege itself (with which"
453,INTRODUCTION.,"alone the Iliad has to do), and ten consumed in the weary wanderings and"
454,INTRODUCTION.,final return home of the surviving Greek heroes who had taken part in
455,INTRODUCTION.,the expedition.
456,INTRODUCTION.,
457,INTRODUCTION.,The first decade begins with the carrying off from the court of
458,INTRODUCTION.,"Menelaus, king of Sparta, of his wife Helen, by a young Asiatic prince"
459,INTRODUCTION.,whom he has entertained in his travels. Helen is the reputed daughter of
460,INTRODUCTION.,"Jupiter by Leda, and upon her Venus has bestowed the fatal endowment of"
461,INTRODUCTION.,matchless and irresistible beauty. The young prince whom she unhappily
462,INTRODUCTION.,"captivates is Paris or Alexander, son of Priam, king of Troy. Terrible"
463,INTRODUCTION.,oracles had accompanied the birth of him who was to prove the curse of
464,INTRODUCTION.,his father’s people. His mother Hecuba dreamed that she gave birth to a
465,INTRODUCTION.,"flaming brand. The child when born was exposed on Mount Ida, so as to"
466,INTRODUCTION.,"insure his death in infancy without incurring the guilt of blood. But,"
467,INTRODUCTION.,"as in similar legends, the precaution did but help to fulfil the"
468,INTRODUCTION.,"prophecy. In the solitudes of the mountain he grew up, a boy of wondrous"
469,INTRODUCTION.,"beauty, the nursling and the favourite of Venus. There he was called"
470,INTRODUCTION.,upon to decide to whom the “Prize of Beauty”--the golden apple thrown
471,INTRODUCTION.,"by Discord into the feast of the Immortals, with that insidious legend"
472,INTRODUCTION.,"inscribed on it--should be awarded. Three competing goddesses--Juno,"
473,INTRODUCTION.,"Venus, and Minerva, who at least, as the goddess of wisdom, ought to"
474,INTRODUCTION.,have known better--appeared before the young shepherd in all the
475,INTRODUCTION.,"simplicity of immortal costume, in order that he might decide which of"
476,INTRODUCTION.,them was “the fairest.” Each tried to bribe him to adjudge the prize to
477,INTRODUCTION.,"herself. The Queen of Heaven offered him power in the future; Minerva,"
478,INTRODUCTION.,"wisdom; Venus, the loveliest woman upon earth. Paris chose the last. It"
479,INTRODUCTION.,was Helen; for Venus took it very little into her account that she had a
480,INTRODUCTION.,"husband already. It involved also, according to the most picturesque of"
481,INTRODUCTION.,"the legends, a somewhat similar breach of troth on Paris’s part. In the"
482,INTRODUCTION.,"valleys of Ida he had already won the love of the nymph Œnone, but he"
483,INTRODUCTION.,deserts her without scruple under the new temptation.[5] He has learnt
484,INTRODUCTION.,"the secret of his royal birth, and is acknowledged by his father Priam."
485,INTRODUCTION.,"In spite of the warnings of his sister Cassandra, who has a gift of"
486,INTRODUCTION.,"prophecy, and foresees evil from the expedition; in spite, too, of the"
487,INTRODUCTION.,"forsaken Œnone’s wild denunciations, he fits out ships and sets sail for"
488,INTRODUCTION.,Greece. Admitted as a guest to the hospitable court of Menelaus at
489,INTRODUCTION.,"Sparta, he charms both him and Helen by his many accomplishments. The"
490,INTRODUCTION.,"king, gallant and unsuspicious, and of somewhat easy temperament, as"
491,INTRODUCTION.,"appears from several passages of Homer, leaves him still an inmate of"
492,INTRODUCTION.,"his palace, while he himself makes a voyage to Crete. In the husband’s"
493,INTRODUCTION.,"absence, Paris succeeds--not without some degree of violence, according"
494,INTRODUCTION.,"to some of the legends--in carrying off the wife, loading his ships at"
495,INTRODUCTION.,the same time (to give emphatic baseness to the exploit) with a rich
496,INTRODUCTION.,"freight of gold and treasures, the spoils of his absent host. So Venus’s"
497,INTRODUCTION.,"promise is made good, and Priam weakly receives into his palace the"
498,INTRODUCTION.,fatal beauty who is to prove the ruin of the Trojan fortunes.
499,INTRODUCTION.,
500,INTRODUCTION.,The outrage rouses all Greece to arms. Menelaus appeals to his brother
501,INTRODUCTION.,"Agamemnon, king of Argos and Mycenæ, who held some sort of suzerainty"
502,INTRODUCTION.,"over the whole of Greece. The brother-kings were the sons of Atreus, of"
503,INTRODUCTION.,"the great house of Pelops, who gave his name to the peninsula known as"
504,INTRODUCTION.,"the Peloponnesus, and now the Morea. It was a house eminent for wealth"
505,INTRODUCTION.,"and splendour and influence. According to an old proverb, valour and"
506,INTRODUCTION.,"wisdom were given by the gods to other names in larger measure, but"
507,INTRODUCTION.,wealth and power belonged of divine right to the Atridæ. This power must
508,INTRODUCTION.,not be hastily pronounced fabulous. There yet remain traces of the mural
509,INTRODUCTION.,"and sepulchral architecture of Agamemnon’s capital, Mycenæ, which are"
510,INTRODUCTION.,strongly significant of a pre-historical civilisation--an “iron age” of
511,INTRODUCTION.,"massive strength and no mean resources.[6] Agamemnon, in Homer’s poem,"
512,INTRODUCTION.,"carries a sceptre which had literally, not metaphorically, come down to"
513,INTRODUCTION.,him as an heirloom from the king of the gods. Vulcan himself had
514,INTRODUCTION.,"wrought it for Jupiter; Jupiter had given it to Hermes, Hermes to"
515,INTRODUCTION.,"Pelops, and so it had been handed on. It was in some sort the prototype"
516,INTRODUCTION.,of those more than mortal weapons wielded by the heroes of medieval
517,INTRODUCTION.,"romance, which were one secret of their invincible prowess, and which"
518,INTRODUCTION.,"had come from the hand of no human armourer; like the sword Durentaille,"
519,INTRODUCTION.,"which belonged to Charlemagne, and was by him given to his nephew"
520,INTRODUCTION.,"Roland; like Arthur’s Excalibur; or the marvellous blade Recuite, which"
521,INTRODUCTION.,"passed from the hands of Alexander the Great to Ptolemy, from Ptolemy to"
522,INTRODUCTION.,"Judas Maccabæus, and so, through many intermediate owners, to the"
523,INTRODUCTION.,"Emperor Vespasian. To the monarchs of the house of Pelops, then,"
524,INTRODUCTION.,belonged in uncommon degree “the divinity that doth hedge a king;” and
525,INTRODUCTION.,"Agamemnon is recognised, throughout the whole of the Homeric story, as"
526,INTRODUCTION.,pre-eminently “King of Men.” But a terrible curse rested on the house--a
527,INTRODUCTION.,"curse connected with a revolting legend, which, as not recognised by"
528,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer, needs no further notice here, but which was to find ample"
529,INTRODUCTION.,fulfilment in the sequel of Agamemnon’s history.
530,INTRODUCTION.,
531,INTRODUCTION.,The royal sons of Atreus take hasty counsel with such of the
532,INTRODUCTION.,"neighbouring kings and chiefs as they can collect, how they may avenge"
533,INTRODUCTION.,"the wrong. One legend tells us that Tyndarus, the reputed father of"
534,INTRODUCTION.,"Helen, before he gave her in marriage to Menelaus, had pledged all her"
535,INTRODUCTION.,"suitors, among whom were the noblest names of Greece, to avenge any such"
536,INTRODUCTION.,"attempt against the honour of the husband he should choose for her,"
537,INTRODUCTION.,whichever of them he might be: and that they now redeemed that pledge
538,INTRODUCTION.,"when called upon by the king of Sparta. Nestor, king of Pylos, and a"
539,INTRODUCTION.,"chief named Palamedes, went through the coasts of Greece, denouncing"
540,INTRODUCTION.,"the perfidy of the foreign adventurer, and rousing the national feeling"
541,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Greeks, or, as Homer prefers to call them, the Achæans. The"
542,INTRODUCTION.,chiefs did not all obey the summons willingly. Odysseus--better known to
543,INTRODUCTION.,us under the Latin form of his name as Ulysses--king of the rocky island
544,INTRODUCTION.,"of Ithaca, feigned madness to escape from his engagement. But the shrewd"
545,INTRODUCTION.,"Palamedes detected the imposture. He went to the field where the king,"
546,INTRODUCTION.,"after the simple fashion of the times, was ploughing, carrying with him"
547,INTRODUCTION.,"from the house his infant child Telemachus, and laid him down in the"
548,INTRODUCTION.,"furrow which Ulysses was moodily driving, apparently insensible to all"
549,INTRODUCTION.,"other sights and sounds. The father turned the plough aside, and his"
550,INTRODUCTION.,"assumed madness was at once detected. In some cases, where there were"
551,INTRODUCTION.,"several sons of military age in the same family, lots were cast for the"
552,INTRODUCTION.,unwelcome honour of serving against Troy. Some even sent bribes to
553,INTRODUCTION.,Agamemnon to induce him to set them free from their engagement.
554,INTRODUCTION.,"Echepolus of Sicyon, loath to leave his vast possessions, sent to the"
555,INTRODUCTION.,"great king his celebrated mare Œthe, the fleetest of her kind, as his"
556,INTRODUCTION.,"personal ransom. The bribe was accepted, and Œthe went to Troy instead"
557,INTRODUCTION.,of her luxurious master. The story has been adduced in proof of
558,INTRODUCTION.,Agamemnon’s greediness in thus preferring private gain to the public
559,INTRODUCTION.,"interests: but no less a critic than Aristotle has sagaciously observed,"
560,INTRODUCTION.,that a good horse was a far more valuable conscript than an unwilling
561,INTRODUCTION.,"soldier. Some heroes, on the other hand, went resolutely to the war,"
562,INTRODUCTION.,though the fates foretold that they should never return from it alive.
563,INTRODUCTION.,"Euchenor of Corinth, though rich like Echepolus, could not be persuaded"
564,INTRODUCTION.,"to remain at home, even when his aged father, who was a seer himself,"
565,INTRODUCTION.,"forewarned him of his doom; he boldly dared his fate, and fell at the"
566,INTRODUCTION.,close of the siege by the hand of Paris.
567,INTRODUCTION.,
568,INTRODUCTION.,Under somewhat similar auguries the great hero of Homer’s tale left his
569,INTRODUCTION.,"home for Troy. Achilles, said the legends, was the son of the"
570,INTRODUCTION.,"ocean-goddess Thetis by a mortal lover, Peleus son of Æacus. The gods"
571,INTRODUCTION.,had honoured the marriage with their personal presence--
572,INTRODUCTION.,
573,INTRODUCTION.,"“For in that elder time, when truth and worth"
574,INTRODUCTION.,"Were still revered and cherished here on earth,"
575,INTRODUCTION.,The tenants of the skies would oft descend
576,INTRODUCTION.,"To heroes’ spotless homes, as friend to friend;"
577,INTRODUCTION.,"There meet them face to face, and freely share"
578,INTRODUCTION.,In all that stirred the hearts of mortals there.”[7]
579,INTRODUCTION.,
580,INTRODUCTION.,"The Roman poet Catullus tells us in the same beautiful ode, how mortals"
581,INTRODUCTION.,and immortals alike brought their wedding gifts: Chiron the centaur
582,INTRODUCTION.,"(“that divine beast,” as Pindar calls him) comes from the mountains"
583,INTRODUCTION.,"laden with coronals of flowers for the banquet, and Peneus, the"
584,INTRODUCTION.,"Thessalian river-god, brings whole trees of beech and bay and cypress to"
585,INTRODUCTION.,"shade the guests. Even the three weird sisters, the inexorable Fates,"
586,INTRODUCTION.,"tune their voices for this once into a nuptial hymn, and while their"
587,INTRODUCTION.,"spindles “run and weave the threads of doom,” they chant the future"
588,INTRODUCTION.,glories of the child that shall be born from this auspicious union.
589,INTRODUCTION.,Neptune presents the fortunate bridegroom with two horses of divine
590,INTRODUCTION.,breed--Xanthus and Balius--and Chiron gives him a wondrous ashen spear.
591,INTRODUCTION.,"Both these gifts passed afterwards as heirlooms to Achilles, the"
592,INTRODUCTION.,"offspring of this marriage, and were carried by him to Troy."
593,INTRODUCTION.,
594,INTRODUCTION.,"Achilles is the very model of a hero, such as heroes would be accounted"
595,INTRODUCTION.,in times when the softer and nobler qualities of true heroism were
596,INTRODUCTION.,"unknown. Strong and beautiful in person, as a goddess-born should be;"
597,INTRODUCTION.,"haughty, and prompt to resent insult, but gallant and generous;"
598,INTRODUCTION.,"passionate alike in his love and in his hate; a stanch friend, and a"
599,INTRODUCTION.,bitter enemy. He is the prototype of Sir Lancelot in many points--“the
600,INTRODUCTION.,goodliest person that ever came among press of knights--the truest
601,INTRODUCTION.,friend to his lover that ever bestrod horse--the sternest man to his
602,INTRODUCTION.,mortal foe that ever put spear in rest.” The epithet which Homer himself
603,INTRODUCTION.,gives him is precisely that which was given to the English king who was
604,INTRODUCTION.,held to be the flower of chivalry--“Lionheart.” Though in personal
605,INTRODUCTION.,strength and speed of foot he excels all the other heroes of the
606,INTRODUCTION.,"expedition, yet he is not a mere fighter, like his comrade Ajax, but has"
607,INTRODUCTION.,"all the finer tastes and accomplishments of an age which, however fierce"
608,INTRODUCTION.,"and barbarous in many respects, shows yet a high degree of civilisation."
609,INTRODUCTION.,"Music and song beguile for him the intervals of battle, and, whether"
610,INTRODUCTION.,"indignant, sarcastic, or pathetic, he is always an admirable speaker."
611,INTRODUCTION.,"There is something of a melancholy interest about him, too, not"
612,INTRODUCTION.,"inappropriate to a hero of romance, which the poet never allows us to"
613,INTRODUCTION.,"forget. He has come to Troy with his doom upon him, and he knows it. His"
614,INTRODUCTION.,goddess-mother has told him that there is a twofold destiny possible for
615,INTRODUCTION.,"him: either to live in wealth and peace, and such happiness as they can"
616,INTRODUCTION.,"bring, a long life of inglorious ease in his native land of Phthia, or"
617,INTRODUCTION.,"to embrace in foreign warfare a brief career of victory, a warrior’s"
618,INTRODUCTION.,"death, and undying glory. He makes his choice as a hero should--"
619,INTRODUCTION.,
620,INTRODUCTION.,“One crowded hour of glorious life
621,INTRODUCTION.,Is worth an age without a name.”
622,INTRODUCTION.,
623,INTRODUCTION.,"One fable runs that his mother, Thetis, dipped him when an infant in the"
624,INTRODUCTION.,"river Styx, which made him invulnerable in every point except the heel,"
625,INTRODUCTION.,"by which she held him:[8] but there is no mention of this in the Iliad,"
626,INTRODUCTION.,"and he goes into battle, for all that appears, as liable to wounds and"
627,INTRODUCTION.,"death as any other mortal warrior, and with a presentiment that the last"
628,INTRODUCTION.,awaits him before the capture of Troy is complete.
629,INTRODUCTION.,
630,INTRODUCTION.,At length the ten years’ preparations were all completed. The harbour of
631,INTRODUCTION.,Aulis on the coast of Bœotia was the place fixed for the rendezvous.
632,INTRODUCTION.,From every quarter where the great race of the Achæans had
633,INTRODUCTION.,"settled,--from the wooded valleys of Thessaly, from all the coasts of"
634,INTRODUCTION.,"the Peloponnesus, and the neighbouring islands, from Ithaca and"
635,INTRODUCTION.,Cephallenia on the west to Crete and Rhodes on the east--the chiefs and
636,INTRODUCTION.,their following were gathered. A hundred ships--long half-decked
637,INTRODUCTION.,"row-galleys, whose average complement was about eighty men--were manned"
638,INTRODUCTION.,"from Agamemnon’s own kingdom of Mycenæ, and he supplied also sixty more"
639,INTRODUCTION.,"to carry the contingent of the Arcadians, who, as an inland people, had"
640,INTRODUCTION.,no fleet of their own. His brother Menelaus brought sixty; Nestor of
641,INTRODUCTION.,"Pylos, ninety; Idomeneus of Crete, and Diomed of Argos, eighty each."
642,INTRODUCTION.,Ulysses and Ajax did but contribute each twelve galleys; but the leaders
643,INTRODUCTION.,"were a host in themselves. In all there were twelve hundred vessels,"
644,INTRODUCTION.,"carrying above 100,000 men. With the exception of the chiefs and two or"
645,INTRODUCTION.,"three officials attached to each galley, such as the helmsman and the"
646,INTRODUCTION.,"steward, all on board were rowers when at sea, and fighting-men on land."
647,INTRODUCTION.,The expedition has been well termed a secular crusade. It was
648,INTRODUCTION.,"undertaken, as modern politicians would say, “for an idea;” not for"
649,INTRODUCTION.,"conquest, but for a point of honour. It might be questioned, indeed, how"
650,INTRODUCTION.,far the object was worth the cost. There was at least one of the
651,INTRODUCTION.,neighbouring kings who at the time took a very unromantic and
652,INTRODUCTION.,"utilitarian view of the matter. Poltis, king of Thrace, was applied to"
653,INTRODUCTION.,amongst the rest for his assistance. He inquired into the cause of the
654,INTRODUCTION.,"expedition; and when he heard it, he suggested an arrangement which"
655,INTRODUCTION.,might accommodate all differences without the necessity of an appeal to
656,INTRODUCTION.,"arms. “It is hard,” he said, “for Menelaus to lose a wife: yet very"
657,INTRODUCTION.,"probably Paris wanted one. Now I have two wives, whom I can well spare;"
658,INTRODUCTION.,"I will send one to Menelaus, and the other to Paris; and so all parties"
659,INTRODUCTION.,will be satisfied.” But we might have lost the Iliad if his counsel had
660,INTRODUCTION.,been taken.
661,INTRODUCTION.,
662,INTRODUCTION.,"The great host set sail; but the first time, says the legend, they"
663,INTRODUCTION.,missed their way. They mistook a part of the coast called Teuthrania for
664,INTRODUCTION.,"the plains of Troy; and then, re-embarking, were driven by a storm back"
665,INTRODUCTION.,to the shores of Greece. A second time they made their rendezvous at
666,INTRODUCTION.,"Aulis; but Agamemnon had incurred the anger of Diana, and the fleet lay"
667,INTRODUCTION.,wind-bound for many weeks. It was then that deed of purest tragedy was
668,INTRODUCTION.,"done, which, though it forms no part of Homer’s story, has been so often"
669,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject of song, of painting, and of sculpture, and has received so"
670,INTRODUCTION.,"many illustrations in modern literature, that it must find place here."
671,INTRODUCTION.,The king is informed by the oracle that the wrath of Heaven can only be
672,INTRODUCTION.,"appeased by the sacrifice of his virgin daughter Iphianassa, or as she"
673,INTRODUCTION.,"is more commonly called, Iphigenia. Reluctantly, and only after a bitter"
674,INTRODUCTION.,"struggle with his feelings, urged by the importunate clamour of the"
675,INTRODUCTION.,"whole army, and in obedience to his conception of his duties as their"
676,INTRODUCTION.,"chief, the father consented. The story is immortalised by the anecdote"
677,INTRODUCTION.,"told of Timanthes, the painter of Sicyon, when competing with a rival in"
678,INTRODUCTION.,a picture of the sacrifice. The point of admitted difficulty with both
679,INTRODUCTION.,the competitors was to portray the agony in the father’s features at the
680,INTRODUCTION.,moment when the sacrificing priest was about to strike the fatal blow.
681,INTRODUCTION.,The great artist represented the king as wrapping his face in the folds
682,INTRODUCTION.,"of his mantle, and was at once pronounced the winner of the prize. Mr"
683,INTRODUCTION.,Tennyson--never more successful than when he draws his inspiration from
684,INTRODUCTION.,the old classical sources--has made tasteful use of both legend and
685,INTRODUCTION.,anecdote in his ‘Dream of Fair Women.’ It is Iphigenia who speaks:--
686,INTRODUCTION.,
687,INTRODUCTION.,"“I was cut off from hope in that sad place,"
688,INTRODUCTION.,Which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears:
689,INTRODUCTION.,My father held his hand upon his face;
690,INTRODUCTION.,"I, blinded with my tears,"
691,INTRODUCTION.,
692,INTRODUCTION.,"“Still strove to speak: my voice was thick with sighs,"
693,INTRODUCTION.,As in a dream. Dimly I could descry
694,INTRODUCTION.,"The stern black-bearded kings with wolfish eyes,"
695,INTRODUCTION.,Waiting to see me die.
696,INTRODUCTION.,
697,INTRODUCTION.,"“The tall masts quivered as they lay afloat,"
698,INTRODUCTION.,The temples and the people and the shore;
699,INTRODUCTION.,"One drew a sharp knife through my tender throat,"
700,INTRODUCTION.,"Slowly,--and nothing more.”"
701,INTRODUCTION.,
702,INTRODUCTION.,"There was, however, a less harrowing version of the legend. As in the"
703,INTRODUCTION.,"parallel case of Jephtha’s daughter, there were found interpreters who"
704,INTRODUCTION.,could not bear that the sacrifice should be carried out. They said that
705,INTRODUCTION.,"in mercy Diana substituted a fawn, and carried off the maiden to serve"
706,INTRODUCTION.,her as a priestess in perpetual maidenhood at her shrine in the Tauric
707,INTRODUCTION.,Chersonese. It is this version of the tale which the Greek tragedian
708,INTRODUCTION.,"Euripides has followed in his “Iphigenia in Aulis.” Racine, in his"
709,INTRODUCTION.,"tragedy, avails himself of a third version of the catastrophe. The"
710,INTRODUCTION.,victim whom Calchas’ oracle demands must be a princess of the blood of
711,INTRODUCTION.,Helen. This Agamemnon’s daughter was--her mother Clytemnestra being
712,INTRODUCTION.,"Helen’s sister. But at the last moment another Iphigenia is found,"
713,INTRODUCTION.,offspring of a previous secret marriage of Helen with Theseus. The
714,INTRODUCTION.,"French tragedian, following Euripides in representing the princess as"
715,INTRODUCTION.,"promised in marriage to Achilles, has given the necessary amount of"
716,INTRODUCTION.,romance to the _denouement_ by introducing the hero as an impetuous
717,INTRODUCTION.,"lover of the modern type, surrounding the altar with his faithful"
718,INTRODUCTION.,"Myrmidons, and vowing that Calchas himself shall be the first"
719,INTRODUCTION.,victim--until the old soothsayer hits upon the expedient of a
720,INTRODUCTION.,satisfactory substitute.
721,INTRODUCTION.,
722,INTRODUCTION.,"The wrath of Diana is appeased, the favouring gales are granted, and"
723,INTRODUCTION.,once more the Greek armament sets sail. They break their voyage at the
724,INTRODUCTION.,"island of Tenedos; and from thence Menelaus, accompanied by Ulysses, who"
725,INTRODUCTION.,"is the diplomatist of the army, proceeds to Troy to make a final demand"
726,INTRODUCTION.,"for reparation. Even now, if the Trojans will give back Helen and the"
727,INTRODUCTION.,"treasures, the Greeks will be satisfied. But the terms were rejected,"
728,INTRODUCTION.,though the reception of the embassy at Troy seems to mark a high state
729,INTRODUCTION.,of civilisation. So the expedition proceeds: but before they make good
730,INTRODUCTION.,"their landing on the Trojan coast, the Fates demand another victim. The"
731,INTRODUCTION.,oracle had said that the first who set foot on Trojan soil must fall.
732,INTRODUCTION.,"There was a hesitation even among the bravest of the Greeks, and the"
733,INTRODUCTION.,"Trojans and their allies were lining the shore. Protesilaus of Phylacè,"
734,INTRODUCTION.,"with a gallant disregard of omens, leapt to land, and fell, first of his"
735,INTRODUCTION.,"countrymen, by a Dardanian spear--launched, as one legend has it, by the"
736,INTRODUCTION.,noble hand of Hector. Homer has a pathetic touch in his mention of
737,INTRODUCTION.,him:--
738,INTRODUCTION.,
739,INTRODUCTION.,"“Unfinished his proud palaces remain,"
740,INTRODUCTION.,And his sad consort beats her breast in vain.”
741,INTRODUCTION.,
742,INTRODUCTION.,"On this slight foundation the Roman poet, Ovid, has constructed one of"
743,INTRODUCTION.,the sweetest of his imaginary ‘Epistles’--that of the wife Laodamia to
744,INTRODUCTION.,"the husband of whom she complains as sending no message home, undreaming"
745,INTRODUCTION.,that he had long since found a grave on the soil of Troy. A later legend
746,INTRODUCTION.,"tells us that she wearied the gods with prayers and tears, by night and"
747,INTRODUCTION.,"day, to obtain permission to see her husband once again on earth. The"
748,INTRODUCTION.,boon was granted: for the space of three hours the dead hero was allowed
749,INTRODUCTION.,"to revisit his home, and Laodamia died in his embrace. There is a poetic"
750,INTRODUCTION.,"sequel to the tradition, preserved by Pliny,[9] and thus beautifully"
751,INTRODUCTION.,rendered in the concluding lines of Wordsworth’s ‘Laodamia:’--
752,INTRODUCTION.,
753,INTRODUCTION.,“Upon the side
754,INTRODUCTION.,Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained)
755,INTRODUCTION.,A knot of spiry trees for ages grew
756,INTRODUCTION.,From out the tomb of him for whom she died;
757,INTRODUCTION.,"And ever, when such stature they had gained"
758,INTRODUCTION.,"That Ilium’s walls were subject to their view,"
759,INTRODUCTION.,The trees’ tall summits withered at the sight--
760,INTRODUCTION.,A constant interchange of growth and blight!”
761,INTRODUCTION.,
762,INTRODUCTION.,"The Trojans, too, had their allies, who came to their aid, when the"
763,INTRODUCTION.,"invasion was imminent, from the neighbouring tribes of Mysia, Caria,"
764,INTRODUCTION.,"Phrygia, and even the coast towns of Thrace. The most renowned of these"
765,INTRODUCTION.,"auxiliary chiefs were Sarpedon, who led the Lycian troops, and Æneas,"
766,INTRODUCTION.,commander of the Dardanians. Both claimed an immortal descent: Æneas was
767,INTRODUCTION.,"the son of Venus by a human lover, Anchises, and sprung from a branch of"
768,INTRODUCTION.,the royal house of Troy: Sarpedon’s father was no less than Jupiter
769,INTRODUCTION.,"himself. Next after Hector, the most warlike, but not the eldest of the"
770,INTRODUCTION.,"sons of Priam, these are the most illustrious names on the side of the"
771,INTRODUCTION.,Trojans in Homer’s story. But the force of the invaders was too strong
772,INTRODUCTION.,to allow their adversaries to keep the open field. Soon they were driven
773,INTRODUCTION.,"inside the walls of the city, while the Greeks ravaged all the"
774,INTRODUCTION.,"neighbouring coast almost unopposed, and maintained themselves at the"
775,INTRODUCTION.,enemy’s cost. Then began the weary siege which wasted the hopes and
776,INTRODUCTION.,resources of both armies for ten long years. To the long night-watches
777,INTRODUCTION.,round the camp-fires of the Greeks we are indebted--so the legends
778,INTRODUCTION.,say--for at least one invention which has enlivened many a waste hour
779,INTRODUCTION.,"since, and also, it perhaps may be said, has wasted some hours for its"
780,INTRODUCTION.,"more enthusiastic admirers. Palamedes, to cheer the nagging spirits of"
781,INTRODUCTION.,"his countrymen, invented for them, among other pastimes, the nobler"
782,INTRODUCTION.,"game of chess; and kings and castles, knights and pawns, still move in"
783,INTRODUCTION.,illustration of the greater game which was then being played on the
784,INTRODUCTION.,"plains of Troy. The inventor met with but an ungrateful return,"
785,INTRODUCTION.,"according to one gloomy legend--which, however, is not Homer’s. Ulysses"
786,INTRODUCTION.,had never forgiven him the detection of the pretence of madness by which
787,INTRODUCTION.,he had sought himself to escape the service; nor could he bear so close
788,INTRODUCTION.,a rival in what he considered his own exclusive field of subtlety and
789,INTRODUCTION.,stratagem. He took the occasion of a fishing expedition to plunge the
790,INTRODUCTION.,unfortunate chief overboard.
791,INTRODUCTION.,
792,INTRODUCTION.,So much of preface seems almost necessary to enable any reader to whom
793,INTRODUCTION.,"the Greek mythology is not already familiar ground, to take up Homer’s"
794,INTRODUCTION.,tale with some such previous acquaintance with the subject as the bard
795,INTRODUCTION.,himself would have given him credit for. The want of it has sometimes
796,INTRODUCTION.,made the study of the Iliad less interesting and less intelligent than
797,INTRODUCTION.,"it should have been, even to those who have approached it with some"
798,INTRODUCTION.,knowledge of the original language.

802,INTRODUCTION.,"The galleys of the Greeks, when they reached the Trojan coast, were all"
803,INTRODUCTION.,"drawn up on shore, as was their invariable custom at the end of a"
804,INTRODUCTION.,"voyage, and kept in an upright position by wooden shores. The crews,"
805,INTRODUCTION.,"with the exception of some two or three “ship-keepers” for each galley,"
806,INTRODUCTION.,"disembarked, and formed some kind of encampment near their respective"
807,INTRODUCTION.,"vessels. Achilles’ station was on one wing, and that of Ajax on the"
808,INTRODUCTION.,other; these points of danger being assigned to the leaders of highest
809,INTRODUCTION.,repute for valour. The chiefs fought in war-chariots of very light
810,INTRODUCTION.,"construction, on two wheels and open at the back. These were drawn by"
811,INTRODUCTION.,"two--or sometimes three--horses, and carried two persons, both standing;"
812,INTRODUCTION.,"the fighter, armed with sword and shield, and one or two long spears"
813,INTRODUCTION.,"which were usually hurled at the enemy--and his charioteer, usually a"
814,INTRODUCTION.,friend of nearly equal rank. The fighters in most cases dismounted from
815,INTRODUCTION.,"their chariots when they came to close quarters, their charioteers"
816,INTRODUCTION.,attending on their movements. The combatants of lower degree fought on
817,INTRODUCTION.,foot. There is no mention of cavalry.

832,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Adopting for himself a method which has since become a rule of art, more"
833,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"or less acknowledged in the literature of fiction, the poet dashes off"
834,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,at once into the full action of his story. He does not ask his readers
835,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,or hearers to accompany the great armament over sea from the shores of
836,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Greece, or give them the history of the long and weary siege. He plunges"
837,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"at one leap into the tenth year of the war. He assumes from the outset,"
838,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"on the part of those to whom he speaks, a general knowledge of the main"
839,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"plot of his poem, and of the characters represented: just as the modern"
840,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,author of a novel or a poem on the Civil Wars of England would assume
841,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"some general acquaintance with the history of Charles I., the character"
842,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of Cromwell, and the breach between King and Commons. Nine whole years"
843,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,are supposed to have already passed in desultory warfare; but for the
844,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"details of these campaigns the modern reader has to go to other sources,"
845,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,with which also the original hearers are supposed to have been
846,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,acquainted. The Trojans and their allies are cooped up within the walls
847,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of their city, while the Greek hero Achilles has spread the terror of"
848,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,his name far and wide.
849,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
850,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,The poet’s exordium is of the very briefest. His invocation to the
851,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,goddess of song is in just three words:--
852,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
853,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Sing, heavenly muse, the wrath of Peleus’ son.”"
854,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
855,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,We have here the key-note of the poem brought before us in the very
856,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"first line--nay, in the very first word, according to the original, for"
857,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“wrath” stands first in the Greek, which it cannot very conveniently do"
858,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"in the English. The two great heroes of the Greek chivalry, Agamemnon"
859,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"and Achilles, always jealous of each other, come to an open quarrel in"
860,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,full council of the princes of the League. Their quarrel is--like the
861,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"original cause of the war, like so many quarrels before and since--about"
862,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"a woman, a beautiful captive. A fatal pestilence is raging in the camp."
863,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The Sun-god, Apollo, is angry. To him and to his twin-sister Diana, the"
864,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Moon, all mysterious diseases were attributed--not without some"
865,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"sufficient reasons, in a hot climate. Pestilence and disease were the"
866,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,arrows of Apollo and Diana. Therefore the Greeks have no doubt as to the
867,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,author of the present calamity. It is “the god of the silver bow” who is
868,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,sending his swift shafts of death amongst them. The poet’s vision even
869,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,sees the dread Archer in bodily shape. It is a fine picture; the English
870,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,reader will lose little of its beauty in Lord Derby’s version:--
871,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
872,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Along Olympus’ heights he passed, his heart"
873,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Burning with wrath; behind his shoulders hung
874,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,His bow and ample quiver; at his back
875,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Rattled the fateful arrows as he moved.
876,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Like the night-cloud he passed, and from afar"
877,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He bent against the ships, and sped the bolt;"
878,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,And fierce and deadly twanged the silver bow.
879,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"First on the mules and dogs, on man the last,"
880,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Was poured the arrowy storm; and through the camp
881,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Constant and numerous blazed the funeral-fires.”
882,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
883,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"In their misery the Greeks appeal to their soothsayer Calchas, to divine"
884,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"for them the cause of the god’s displeasure. The Mantis or soothsayer,"
885,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"whose skill was in most cases supposed to be hereditary, accompanied a"
886,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Greek force on all its expeditions; and no prudent general would risk a
887,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"battle, or engage in any important enterprise, without first"
888,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"ascertaining from this authority the will of the gods, as shadowed out"
889,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"in certain appearances of the sacrifice, or some peculiarity in the"
890,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"flight of birds, or some phenomena of the heavens. In this particular"
891,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,expedition it would appear that Calchas had turned the last branch of
892,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,his art to good purpose; it must have been his knowledge of the stars
893,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"which had enabled him, as Homer tells us, to pilot the great fleet from"
894,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,their own shores to Troy. He confesses that he can read the secret of
895,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Apollo’s present wrath; but he hesitates to tell it, dreading, he says,"
896,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,lest he should thereby anger the “great chief whom the whole host
897,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,obeys.” Achilles charges him to speak out boldly without fear or favour;
898,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,none shall harm him--not even if he should denounce Agamemnon himself as
899,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the cause of this visitation, adds the hero, gladly seizing the"
900,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"opportunity of hurling a defiance at his great rival. Thus supported,"
901,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the seer speaks out; Agamemnon is indeed the guilty cause. In a late
902,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"foray he had taken captive the maiden daughter of Chryses, a priest of"
903,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the Sun-god, and the father had come to the camp of the invaders as a"
904,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"suppliant, pleading the sanctity of his office, and offering a fitting"
905,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"ransom. The great king had refused to listen, had sent him away with"
906,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,bitter words and threats; and the priest had prayed to his god to punish
907,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the insult: hence the pestilence. Immediately the popular
908,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,voice--expressed loudly through Achilles--demands the maiden’s instant
909,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"restitution to her father. Agamemnon, though burning with indignation"
910,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"alike against the seer and his champion, dares not refuse. His"
911,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"prerogative, however generally admitted and respected by the confederate"
912,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"army, is dependent in such extremities on the popular will. He promises"
913,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,at once to send back the daughter of Chryses unharmed and without
914,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"ransom. But at the same time, after a stormy and bitter dispute with"
915,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Achilles, he announces his intention to insist on that chief resigning,"
916,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"by way of exchange, a fair captive named Briseis, carried off in some"
917,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"similar raid, who had been awarded to him as his share of the public"
918,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"spoil. To this insolent demand the majority of the council of chiefs,"
919,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"content with their victory on the main question, appear to raise no"
920,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,objection. But Achilles--his impetuous nature roused to madness by the
921,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,studied insult--leaps up and half unsheathes his sword. Even then--such
922,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,is the Greek’s reverence for authority--he hesitates; and as he stands
923,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"with his hand upon the hilt, there sweeps down from Olympus[10] Pallas"
924,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Athene (Minerva), the goddess of wisdom, sent by Here (Juno) Queen of"
925,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Heaven to check this fatal strife between her favourite Greeks. The
926,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,celestial messenger is visible to Achilles alone. She calms the hero’s
927,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"wrath so far as to restrain him from any act of violence; but, as she"
928,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"disappears, he turns on his enemy, and swears a mighty oath--the royal"
929,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"oath of kings--by the golden-studded staff, or “sceptre,” which was"
930,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"borne by king, priest, and judge as the emblem of their authority."
931,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Pope’s rendering has all the fire of the original, and the additional"
932,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,touches which he throws in are at least in a kindred spirit:--
933,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
934,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“By this I swear, when bleeding Greece again"
935,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain:"
936,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,When flushed with slaughter Hector comes to spread
937,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The purpled shore with mountains of the dead,"
938,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Then shalt thou mourn th’ affront thy madness gave,"
939,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Forced to deplore, when impotent to save;"
940,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Then rage in bitterness of soul, to know"
941,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,This act has made the bravest Greek thy foe.”
942,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
943,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He dashes his sceptre on the ground, and sits down in savage silence."
944,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Agamemnon is ready enough to return the taunt, when there rises in the"
945,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"assembly a venerable figure, whose grey hairs and tried sagacity in"
946,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"council command at once the respect of all. It is Nestor, the"
947,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,hoary-headed chieftain of the rocky Pylos in the Peloponnese--known in
948,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his more vigorous days as “the horse-tamer,” and, in sooth, not a little"
949,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,proud of his past exploits. Two generations of men he has already
950,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"outlived in his own dominions, and is now loved and respected by the"
951,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,third. He has joined the great armament still sound in wind and limb;
952,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,but he is valued now not so much for his
953,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,

963,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"shame to the Greeks, a triumph to the enemy. His words ring like the"

976,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of an old man’s garrulity. But the reader, it should be remembered,"
977,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"really wants to know something about him, even if the Greeks may have"
978,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,been supposed to have heard his story before.

994,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The angry chiefs do hear him so far, that after the interchange of a few"

997,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Patroclus (of whom we shall hear more), and followed by his retinue."
998,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Agamemnon proceeds at once to carry out his resolution. He despatches a
999,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"galley with a trusty crew, under the command of the sage Ulysses, to the"
1000,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"island of Chrysa, to restore the old priest’s daughter to him in all"
1001,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"honour, with expiatory presents, and the offer of a hecatomb to the"
1002,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Sun-god. They make the voyage quickly, and arrive safely at the island."
1003,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,The rapid movement here of Homer’s verse has rarely been more happily
1004,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,rendered than in the English hexameters of Mr Landon:--
1005,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1006,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Out were the anchors cast, and the ropes made fast to the steerage;"
1007,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Out did the sailors leap on the foaming beach of the ocean;
1008,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Out was the hecatomb led for the skilful marksman Apollo;
1009,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Out Chryseis arose from the ship that sped through the waters.”
1010,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1011,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"So, by the good priest’s prayers, the god is propitiated, and the plague"
1012,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,in the Greek host is stayed.
1013,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1014,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Meanwhile another embassy, on a very different errand, has been"
1015,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"despatched by the King of Men to the tents where Achilles lies, hard by"
1016,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his ships, with his fierce bands of Myrmidons encamped around him. Their"
1017,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"name has passed into a by-word, being commonly but incorrectly used to"
1018,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"designate an unscrupulous rabble of followers, to whom their leader’s"
1019,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"word is law. The notion must be derived not from Homer, but from Pope."
1020,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"In his version of the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles, he makes"
1021,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the former say to his antagonist--
1022,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1023,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Go, threat thine earth-born Myrmidons; but here"
1024,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"’Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.”"
1025,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1026,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"But to suppose that the Myrmidons were subservient to any man’s threats,"
1027,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,is to give them a very different character from what we find in Homer.
1028,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Even the epithet “earth-born,” which is Pope’s, not Homer’s, and which"
1029,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"may easily be misunderstood, they would have prized as a high"
1030,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"compliment, implying that they were no new race, but the aboriginal"
1031,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,possessors of their native soil; just as the proud Athenians wore the
1032,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“golden grasshopper” in their hair, because that insect was fabled to"
1033,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,owe its birth to the spontaneous action of the earth. The followers of
1034,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Achilles were indeed “fierce as ravening wolves,” as the poet has"
1035,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,afterwards described them; but they were the very flower of the Greek
1036,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"army, troops of whom any leader might be proud, and if they had a"
1037,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"wolfish thirst for blood, they were no worse and no better in this"
1038,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"respect than Achilles himself, or any captain in the host before Troy;"
1039,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"for an insatiable ferocity, when once the spirit of combativeness is"
1040,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"aroused, is the characteristic of all Homer’s heroes, as in those of the"
1041,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,medieval romances.
1042,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1043,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The purpose of the king’s embassy to Achilles is, of course, in"
1044,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"pursuance of his threat, to demand the surrender of the fair Briseis."
1045,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Such a message to such a man is no very safe or agreeable errand. But
1046,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Agamemnon chooses his envoys well. He sends two heralds--Eurybates and
1047,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Talthybius. The herald’s office, in early Greek warfare, had an especial"
1048,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,sanctity. Those who held it were not mere officials whose name protected
1049,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"them, but men of noble and even of royal birth, who might have been"
1050,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"captains of thousands themselves, if they had not chosen, as it were,"
1051,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the civilian’s place in warfare. Such diplomacy as there was room for
1052,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,in those ages was transacted by them. They were under the special
1053,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"protection of Zeus, as the god of oaths and treaties. There was no fear"
1054,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"that the noble chief of the Myrmidons, even in his most furious mood,"
1055,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,would treat such envoys rudely. But in fact his reception of them is one
1056,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of the most remarkable scenes in the poem, both from its high-toned"
1057,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,courtesy and from its strong contrast with the hero’s previous bearing
1058,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,towards Agamemnon. Achilles receives the heralds of the king much as a
1059,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,well-bred gentleman of fifty years ago would have received the “friend”
1060,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,who carried a hostile message from one with whom he had a deadly quarrel
1061,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,a few hours before. The demand which they brought from Agamemnon was
1062,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"pointed with the additional threat that, if he refused to give up the"
1063,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"damsel, the king would come himself and carry her off by the strong"
1064,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"hand,--a threat almost brutal, because quite unwarranted; since Achilles"
1065,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"had declared in the council that if the Greeks, who had awarded her as"
1066,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his battle-prize, chose to acquiesce in the injustice of demanding her"
1067,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"back from him, _he_ should make no resistance. But it does not seem that"
1068,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the heralds delivered themselves of the additional insult which they
1069,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,were charged to convey. They had no need. As they stand at the entrance
1070,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of his tent, “troubled and awe-stricken,” loath to begin their unwelcome"
1071,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"tale, Achilles sets them at their ease at once in a few calm and"
1072,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,dignified words. He recognises in them “the messengers of Zeus”--and if
1073,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"now by accident of Agamemnon, the offence is his, not theirs. He at once"
1074,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"bids Patroclus lead forth the damsel, and gives her into their custody,"
1075,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"to deal with according to their orders. He repeats his oath, however,"
1076,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,though in calmer terms; and calls them to witness before heaven that
1077,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Agamemnon, in his day of need, shall look in vain for the saving arm of"
1078,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the man he has insulted.
1079,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1080,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"It is something in favour of a tender side to the hero’s character, that"
1081,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the “fair-cheeked” Briseis, spoil of war though she was, parts from him"
1082,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"very reluctantly. Achilles, for his share, fairly weeps: but not the"
1083,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,most romantic reader of the story dares nurse the idea that it is for
1084,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his Briseis. They who bring with them, to the pages of classical"
1085,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"fiction, a taste which has been built up by modern song and romance,"
1086,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,must be warned at once that there is no love-story in either Iliad or
1087,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Odyssey. Indeed, one remarkable point of difference between the"
1088,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"imaginative writers of antiquity and those of our own days, lies in the"
1089,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,absence of that which is the motive and the key-note of five-sixths of
1090,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"our modern tales in prose and verse. Love between unmarried persons, in"
1091,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the sense in which we commonly use the word, seems very much the product"
1092,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,of modern civilisation. There is indeed a passion which we name by the
1093,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"same English word--the mere animal passion, which Homer, to do him"
1094,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"justice, deals with but as a matter of fact, and never paints in"
1095,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,attractive colours. There is again a love of another kind--the love of
1096,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the husband for his wife and of the wife for her husband--which the old
1097,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"poet also well understood, and which furnishes him with scenes of the"
1098,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,highest pathos and beauty. But as to the sentiment which forms the
1099,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"common staple of modern romance and drama, Homer certainly did not know"
1100,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"what it meant, nor Achilles or Briseis either. As for the latter, if she"
1101,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"shed tears, it was no doubt because she had found in Achilles a kind"
1102,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"and generous lord and master, who had made her captive lot (which might"
1103,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,chance to come to the turn of any lady or princess in those warlike
1104,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,times) as tolerable as such a life could be; and because Agamemnon--if
1105,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,she had heard his character from Achilles--did not promise a very
1106,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,favourable change in that respect.
1107,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1108,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Achilles weeps--but not for Briseis. He is touched in a point where he
1109,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,is far more sensitive--his honour. He has been robbed of the guerdon of
1110,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"valour, bestowed on him in full conclave of the chiefs of the army. He"
1111,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"has been robbed of it by Agamemnon--the man for whose especial sake, to"
1112,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"avenge whose family wrongs, he has come on this long expedition from his"
1113,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,home. This was his indignant protest in their dispute at the council--
1114,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1115,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,“Well dost thou know that ’twas no feud of mine
1116,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"With Troy’s brave sons, that brought me here in arms;"
1117,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,They never did me wrong; they never drove
1118,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"My cattle, or my horses; never sought"
1119,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,In Phthia’s fertile life-sustaining fields
1120,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,To waste the crops; for wide between us lay
1121,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,The shadowy mountains and the roaring sea.
1122,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"With thee, O void of shame! with thee we sailed,"
1123,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"For Menelaüs and for thee, ingrate,"
1124,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Glory and fame on Trojan crests to win.” (D.)
1125,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1126,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"And now this is his reward! And the whole Greek army, too, have made"
1127,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"themselves partakers in the wrong, inasmuch as they have tamely looked"
1128,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"on, and allowed the haughty king thus to override honour, gratitude, and"
1129,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"justice. His indignation is intense. He wanders away, and sits alone on"
1130,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the sea-beach, “gazing vacantly on the illimitable ocean.” Soon there"
1131,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"comes a change upon his spirit; and now, with a childlike"
1132,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"petulance--these Homeric heroes, with all their fierce ways, are still"
1133,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"so very childlike, and therefore so human and so interesting--he cries"
1134,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"to his mother. True, that mother is, as we remember, a goddess--Thetis,"
1135,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"daughter of the great Jupiter, and of potent influence in the waters"
1136,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,beneath the earth. To her he bemoans himself. That his days were to be
1137,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"few, he knew when he came here to Troy; but she had promised him undying"
1138,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,renown. It has failed him: his “one crowded hour of glorious life” is
1139,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"darkened in dishonour. He cries, and his goddess-mother hears him--"
1140,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1141,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Beside her aged father where she sat,"
1142,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,In the deep ocean-caves.”
1143,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1144,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,It is the original of our own Milton’s beautiful invocation in
1145,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Comus--the rough simple outline on which he has painted with a grace and
1146,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,fulness which make it all his own--
1147,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1148,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,“Sabrina fair!
1149,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Listen, where thou art sitting"
1150,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,"
1151,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,In twisted braids of lilies knitting
1152,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;
1153,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Listen for dear honour’s sake,"
1154,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Goddess of the silver lake,"
1155,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Listen, and save!”"
1156,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1157,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Thetis hears, and rises on the sea--“like as it were a mist”--(the"
1158,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“White Lady of Avenel”) caresses him soothingly with her hand, as though"
1159,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the stalwart warrior were still a child indeed, and asks him the simple"
1160,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"question which all mothers, goddesses or not, would put into much the"
1161,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"same words--“My son, why weepest thou?” He tells his tale of wrong; and"
1162,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"she proceeds to give him, in the first place, advice certainly not wiser"
1163,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,than that of some earthly mothers. She does not advise him to make up
1164,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his quarrel with Agamemnon, but to nurse his wrath, and withdraw"
1165,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"himself wholly from the siege. She, meanwhile, will intercede with"
1166,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Jupiter, and beseech him to grant the Trojans victory for a while, that"
1167,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,so the Greeks may learn to feel the loss of the hero whom they have
1168,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,insulted.
1169,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1170,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"There is an obstacle, however, in the way of the immediate performance"
1171,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of her promise--a ludicrous obstacle, to our modern taste, though the"
1172,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,poet does not so intend it. The King of the Gods has gone out to
1173,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"dinner--or rather to a continuous festival of twelve days, to which he"
1174,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,has been invited by “the blameless Ethiopians;”[11] a race with whom the
1175,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Immortals of Olympus have some mysterious connection, which has been"
1176,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,held to imply an Eastern origin for the Greek religion and race. With
1177,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the dawn of the twelfth morning, however, Thetis presents herself in the"
1178,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“brazen-floored” halls of Jupiter, and we are introduced to the Olympian"
1179,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,court and household. A strange picture it is--such a travesty of a
1180,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,divine life as makes us wonder what the poet himself really conceived of
1181,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the gods of his adoption. The life of mortal heroes in the world below
1182,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,is grandeur and nobleness itself compared with that of the Olympian
1183,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,heaven. Its pleasures indeed are much the same--those of sensual
1184,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"gratification; the feast, the wine-cup, music and song, are what gods"
1185,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,and goddesses delight in as much as those whom the poet pathetically
1186,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,calls “the creatures of a day.” But all their passions are incomparably
1187,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,meaner. The wrath of Achilles is dignified--Juno’s anger against Troy
1188,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,is mere vicious spite. The subtle craft of Ulysses is at least exercised
1189,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,for the benefit of his countrymen and their cause; but the shifty
1190,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"counsels of Jupiter are the mere expedients of a cunning despot who,"
1191,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"between queen and ministers and favourites, finds it difficult, in spite"
1192,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of his despotism, to have his own way. The quarrel between Agamemnon and"
1193,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Achilles is tragedy: the domestic wrangles of the Thunderer and his
1194,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"queen are in the very spirit of low comedy, and not even the burlesques"
1195,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of Life in Olympus, which some years ago were popular on our English"
1196,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"stage, went far beyond the recognised legends of mythology. In fact, the"
1197,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"comic element, what little there is of it in the Iliad, is supplied"
1198,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,(with the single exception of the incident of Thersites) by the powers
1199,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,whom the poet recognises as divinities. The idea of rival wills and
1200,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,influences existing in the supernatural world led the poet necessarily
1201,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,to represent his gods as quarrelling; and quarrels in a primitive age
1202,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,are perhaps hardly compatible with dignity. But the conception of gods
1203,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,in human shape has always a tendency to monstrosities and caricature.
1204,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"How close, too, the supernatural and the grotesque seem to lie together"
1205,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,may be seen even in the existing sculptures and carvings of ancient
1206,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Christendom, and still more remarkably in the old Miracle-Plays, which"
1207,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,mix buffoonery with the most sacred subjects in a manner which it is
1208,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,hard to reconcile with any real feeling of reverence.
1209,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1210,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Thetis throws herself at the feet of her father Jupiter, and begs of"
1211,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"him, as a personal favour, the temporary humiliation of Agamemnon and"
1212,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his Greeks. For a while the Thunderer is silent, and hesitates; Thetis"
1213,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,perseveringly clings to his knees. At last he confides to her his dread
1214,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,lest a compliance with her petition should involve him in domestic
1215,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,difficulties.
1216,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1217,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Sad work thou mak’st, in bidding me oppose"
1218,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"My will to Juno’s, when her bitter words"
1219,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Assail me, for full oft amid the gods"
1220,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,She taunts me that I aid the Trojan cause.
1221,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,But thou return--_that Juno see thee not_--
1222,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,And leave to me the furtherance of thy suit.” (D.)
1223,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1224,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He pledges his promise to her, and ratifies it with the mighty nod that"
1225,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,shakes Olympus--a solemn confirmation which made his word irrevocable.
1226,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1227,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Waved on th’ immortal head th’ ambrosial locks,"
1228,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,And all Olympus trembled at his nod.”
1229,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1230,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Critics have somewhat over-praised the grandeur of the image; but it is
1231,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,said that the great sculptor Phidias referred to it as having furnished
1232,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,him with the idea of his noble statue of Olympian Jove. Satisfied with
1233,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"her success, Thetis plunges down from high Olympus into the sea, and the"
1234,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Thunderer proceeds to take his place in full council of the gods, as"
1235,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,calm as if nothing had happened. But there are watchful eyes about him
1236,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"which he has not escaped. Juno has been a witness of the interview, and"
1237,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"has a shrewd suspicion of its object. A connubial dialogue ensues,"
1238,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"which, though the poet has thought fit to transfer the scene of it to"
1239,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Olympus, is of an exceedingly earthly, and what we should now call"
1240,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“realistic,” type. Homer’s recognised translators have not condescended"
1241,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"to give it the homely tone of the original. Pope is grandiloquent, and"
1242,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Lord Derby calmly dignified; but Homer intends to be neither. Mr
1243,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Gladstone’s translation comes nearest the spirit of the Greek. The
1244,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,brief encounter between the king and queen of the Immortals is cut short
1245,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,by the former in rather summary fashion. “Thou hast been promising
1246,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"honour to Achilles, I trow,” says Juno."
1247,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1248,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,“Zeus that rolls the clouds of heaven her addressing answered then;
1249,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,‘Moonstruck! thou art ever _trowing_; never I escape thy ken.
1250,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"After all, it boots thee nothing; leaves thee of my heart the less:"
1251,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,So thou hast the worser bargain. What if I the fact confess?
1252,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"It was done because I willed it. Hold thy peace--my word obey,"
1253,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Lest, if I come near, and on thee these unconquered hands I lay,"
1254,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,All the gods that hold Olympus nought avail thee here to-day.’”[12]
1255,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1256,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He bids her, in very plain Greek, sit down and hold her tongue; and"
1257,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,gives her clearly to understand--with a threat of violence which is an
1258,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,unusual addition to his many failings as a husband--that it is his fixed
1259,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"intention, on this occasion, to be lord and master, not only of Olympus,"
1260,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"but of his wife. Juno is silenced, and the whole assembly of the gods is"
1261,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"startled by the Thunderer’s violence. Vulcan, the fire-god--the lame"
1262,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"brawny hunchback, always more or less the jester and the butt of the"
1263,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"court of Olympus, but with more brains in his head than most of his"
1264,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,straight-limbed compeers--Vulcan comes to the general relief. He soothes
1265,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his royal mother by the argument, that it were ill indeed to break the"
1266,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,peace of heaven for the sake of two or three wretched mortals: and he
1267,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,reminds her--we must suppose in an aside--that they both knew by bitter
1268,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,experience that when the father of gods and men _did_ choose to put
1269,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"forth his might, it went hard with all who resisted."
1270,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1271,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“When to thy succour once before I came,"
1272,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He seized me by the foot, and hurled me down"
1273,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"From heaven’s high threshold; all the day I fell,"
1274,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,And with the setting sun on Lemnos’ isle
1275,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Lighted, scarce half-alive; there was I found,"
1276,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,And by the Sintian people kindly nursed.” (D.)
1277,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1278,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He gives the mother-goddess further comfort--in “a double cup,” which he"
1279,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,proceeds also to hand round the whole of the august circle. They quaff
1280,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"their nectar with unusual zest, as they break into peals of laughter (it"
1281,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"must be confessed, rather ungratefully) at the hobbling gait and awkward"
1282,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,attentions of their new cup-bearer:--
1283,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1284,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,“Thus they till sunset passed the festive hours;
1285,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Nor lacked the banquet aught to please the sense,"
1286,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Nor sound of tuneful lyre by Phœbus touched,"
1287,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Nor Muses’ voice, who in alternate strains"
1288,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Responsive sung; but when the sun had set
1289,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Each to his home departed, where for each"
1290,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The crippled Vulcan, matchless architect,"
1291,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,With wondrous skill a noble house had reared.”
1292,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1293,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"And so, at the end of the first book of the poem, the curtain falls on"
1294,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the Olympian happy family.
1295,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1296,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,But Jupiter has but a wakeful night. He is planning how he may best
1297,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,carry out his promise to Thetis. He sends a lying spirit in a dream to
1298,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Agamemnon at midnight. The vision stands at the head of the king’s
1299,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"couch, taking the shape of old Nestor. In this character it encourages"
1300,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,him to muster all his forces to storm the city of Troy on the morrow.
1301,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Now, at last, the false phantom assures him, its walls are doomed to"
1302,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"fall; the strife in heaven is ended; Juno’s counsels have prevailed, and"
1303,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the fate of Troy is sealed irrevocably.
1304,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1305,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Joyfully the King of Men arises from his sleep, and summons at daybreak"
1306,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"a council of the chiefs. Already, says the poet, he storms and sacks the"
1307,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"royal city in imagination, little foreseeing the long and bloody"
1308,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,struggle that lies yet between him and his prey. In the council he
1309,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"invents a stratagem of his own, which complicates the story considerably"
1310,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,without improving it. He suspects the temper of his army; and before he
1311,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"makes up his mind to lead them to the assault, he seeks to ascertain"
1312,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,whether or no the long ten years’ siege has worn out their patience and
1313,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,broken their spirit. He will try the dangerous experiment of proposing
1314,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,to them to break up the siege and embark at once for home. He himself
1315,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"will make the proposal to the whole army; the other leaders, for their"
1316,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"part, are to oppose such a base retreat, and urge their followers to"
1317,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,make yet another effort for the national honour of Greece.
1318,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1319,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The clans, at the summons of their several chiefs, muster in their"
1320,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"thousands from tents and ships; and Agamemnon, seated on his throne of"
1321,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"state, the immortal sceptre in his hand, harangues them in accordance"
1322,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,with his preconcerted stratagem. He paints in lively colours the
1323,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"weariness of the nine years’ siege, his own disappointed hopes, the"
1324,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,painful yearning of their long-deserted wives and children for the
1325,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,return of their husbands and fathers; and ends by proposing an immediate
1326,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,re-embarkation for home. He plays his part only too successfully. The
1327,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,immense host heaves and sways with excitement at his words--“like the
1328,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"long waves of the Icarian Sea, like the deep tall corn-crop as the"
1329,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,summer wind sweeps over it”--and with tumultuous shouts of exultation
1330,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,they rush down to their galleys and begin at once to launch them; so
1331,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"little regard have the multitude for glory, so strong is their yearning"
1332,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"for home. It is possible that the poet is no unconscious satirist, and"
1333,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"that he willingly allowed his hearers to draw, if they pleased, the"
1334,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"inference which he hints in more than one passage, that war is the sport"
1335,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of princes, for which the masses pay the cost."
1336,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1337,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,But Juno’s ever-watchful eyes have marked the movement. Again Minerva is
1338,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"her messenger, and shoots down from Olympus to stop this disgraceful"
1339,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"flight. She addresses herself to the ear of the sage Ulysses, who knows"
1340,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"her voice at once. Wisdom speaks to the wise,--if any reader prefers the"
1341,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,moral allegory to the simple fiction. Ulysses is standing fixed in
1342,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,disgust and despair at the cowardice of his countrymen. The goddess bids
1343,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,him use all his eloquence to check their flight. Without a word he
1344,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"flings off his cloak,[13] and meeting Agamemnon, receives the immortal"
1345,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"sceptre from his hand, and armed with this staff of authority rushes"
1346,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,down to the galleys. Any king or chieftain whom he encounters he hastily
1347,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,reminds of the secret understanding which had been the result of the
1348,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"previous council, and urges them, at least, to set a braver example. To"
1349,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the plebeian crowd he uses argument of another kind. He applies the
1350,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"royal sceptre to them in one of its primitive uses, as a rod of"
1351,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"correction, and bids them wait for orders from their superiors. Easily"
1352,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"swayed to either course, the crowd are awed into quiet by his energetic"
1353,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,remonstrances. One popular orator alone lifts his well-known voice
1354,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"loudly in defiance. It is a certain Thersites, of whom the poet gives a"
1355,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"sketch, brief enough, but with so many marks of individuality, that we"
1356,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,may be justified in looking at him as a character drawn from life.
1357,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1358,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“The ugliest man was he who came to Troy,"
1359,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"With squinting eyes and one distorted foot,"
1360,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"His shoulders round, and buried in his breast"
1361,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,His narrow head with scanty growth of hair.”
1362,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1363,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"His talent lies in speaking evil of dignities--a talent which, no doubt,"
1364,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"he had found popular enough in some circles of camp society, though all"
1365,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the respectable Greeks, we are assured, are shocked at him. He launches"
1366,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,out now with bitter virulence--in which there is nevertheless (as in
1367,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,most oratory of the kind) a certain amount of truth--against Agamemnon.
1368,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He denounces his greed, his selfishness, his disregard of the sufferings"
1369,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"of his troops, his late treatment of Achilles; they must all be cowards,"
1370,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"he says, to obey such a leader--"
1371,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1372,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,“Women of Greece! I will not call ye men!”
1373,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1374,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Why not sail home at once, and leave him, if he can, to take Troy with"
1375,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,his own single hand?
1376,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1377,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"The mutineer speaks in an evil hour for himself, this time; for Ulysses"
1378,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,hears him. That energetic chief answers him in terms as strong as his
1379,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"own, and warns him that if he should catch him again railing in like"
1380,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,fashion--“taking the name of kings in his abusive mouth”--he will strip
1381,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"his garments from him, and flog him naked back to the ships. And, as an"
1382,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"earnest of his promise, he lays the mighty sceptre heavily on his back"
1383,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,and shoulders. Such prompt and vigorous chastisement meets the popular
1384,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"humour at once; and as the hunchback writhes and howls under the blows,"
1385,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the fickle feelings of the Greeks break forth in peals of laughter. “Of
1386,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the many good things Ulysses has done, this last,” they swear, “is the"
1387,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,best of all.”
1388,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1389,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Then, prompted still by the goddess of Wisdom, Ulysses harangues the"
1390,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,reassembled troops. He reminds them of their plighted oath of service to
1391,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Agamemnon, of the encouraging oracles of heaven, of the disgrace of"
1392,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,returning home from an unaccomplished errand. With the art of a true
1393,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"orator, he sympathises with their late feelings--it _is_ bitter for them"
1394,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"all, indeed, to waste so many years on a foreign shore, far from home,"
1395,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"and wife, and children; but bitterest of all would it be"
1396,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1397,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Long to remain, and bootless to return.”"
1398,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1399,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,The venerable Nestor speaks to the same effect; and Agamemnon himself
1400,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,closes the debate with a call to immediate battle. It is a right royal
1401,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"speech, far more worthy of a true “king of men” than his former"
1402,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"philippics--moderate in his allusion to Achilles, spirited in his appeal"
1403,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,to his warriors.
1404,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1405,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Come but new friendship, and our feud destroy,"
1406,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Then from the evil that is fixed and sealed
1407,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Not one day’s respite shall be left to Troy--
1408,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"But now to dinner, ere we take the field;"
1409,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Let each his spear whet, and prepare his shield,"
1410,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Feed well the horses, and each chariot test,"
1411,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"That we may fight it out till one side yield,"
1412,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Fight in sound harness, and not think of rest,"
1413,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Till the black night decide it as to Zeus seems best.
1414,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1415,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"“Then shall the horses in their foam be wet,"
1416,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,While forward in the glittering car they strain;
1417,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Then shall the straps of the broad buckler sweat
1418,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Round many a breast there battling in the plain;
1419,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Then shall the arm droop, hurling spears with pain:"

1422,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Small for that skulker is the hope, I swear,"
1423,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,But that the dogs he fatten and the fowls of air.” (W.)
1424,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1425,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"He remembers, too, like a wise general, that a battle may be lost by"
1426,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"fighting on an empty stomach. So the oxen and the fatlings are slain,"
1427,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the choice pieces of the thighs and the fat are offered in sacrifice to
1428,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"the gods, and then the whole army feasts their fill. Agamemnon holds a"
1429,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"select banquet of six of the chief leaders--King Idomeneus of Crete,"
1430,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"Nestor, Ajax the Greater and the Less, and Ulysses, “wise in council as"
1431,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,Zeus.” One guest comes uninvited--his brother Menelaus. He is no
1432,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"dinner-loving intruder; he comes, as the poet simply tells us, “because"
1433,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,he knew in his heart how many were his brother’s cares and
1434,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"anxieties,”--he might be of some use or support to him. Throughout the"
1435,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"whole of the poem, the mutual affection borne by these two brothers is"
1436,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"very remarkable, and unlike any type of the same relationship which"
1437,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"exists in fiction. It is never put forward or specially dwelt upon, but"
1438,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,comes out simply and naturally in every particular of their intercourse.
1439,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,
1440,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"A king and priest, like Abraham at Bethel, Agamemnon stands by his"
1441,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"burnt-offering, and lifts his prayer for victory to Jupiter, “most"
1442,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"glorious and most great, who dwells in the clouds and thick darkness.”"
1443,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"But no favourable omen comes from heaven. The god, whether or no he"
1444,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"accepts the offering, gives no sign. Nevertheless--we may suppose with a"
1445,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,certain wilfulness which is part of his character--Agamemnon proceeds to
1446,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,set the battle in array; and the second book of the Iliad closes with
1447,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the long muster-roll of the Greek clans under their respective kings or
1448,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"chiefs on the one side, and of the Trojans and their allies on the"
1449,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"other, which in our introduction has already been partly"
1450,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"anticipated.[14] The long list of chiefs, with their genealogies and"
1451,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"birthplaces, and the strength of their several contingents, was"
1452,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,evidently composed with a view to recitation: and whatever may be its
1453,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"value as an authentic record, we can understand the interest with which"
1454,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,a Greek audience would listen to a muster-roll which was to them what
1455,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,the Roll of Battle Abbey was to the descendants of the Normans in
1456,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"England. If here and there, upon occasion, the wandering minstrel"
1457,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,inserted in the text the name and lineage of some provincial hero on his
1458,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,"own responsibility, the popular applause would assuredly be none the"
1459,THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.,less.

1469,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"The battle is set in array, “army against army.” But there is a"
1470,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,difference in the bearing of the opposed forces which is very
1471,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"significant, and is probably a note of real character, not a mere stroke"
1472,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"of the poet’s art. The Trojan host, after the fashion of Asiatic"
1473,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"warfare, modern as well as ancient, move forward to the combat with loud"
1474,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,shouts and clashing of weapons. The poet compares their confused clamour
1475,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"to the noise of a flock of cranes on their annual migration. The Greeks,"
1476,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"on the other hand, march in silence, with closed ranks, uttering no"
1477,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"sound, but “breathing determination.” So, when afterwards they actually"
1478,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"close for action, not a sound is heard in their ranks but the voice of"
1479,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the leaders giving the word of command. “You would not think,” says the"
1480,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"poet, “that all that mighty host had tongues;” while, in the mixed"
1481,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"battalions of the enemy, whose allies are men of many lands and"
1482,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"languages, there arises a noisy discordant clamour--“like as of bleating"
1483,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,ewes that hear the cries of their lambs.”
1484,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1485,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"But while the hostile forces yet await the signal for the battle, Paris"
1486,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,springs forth alone from the Trojan ranks. “Godlike” he is in his
1487,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"beauty, and with the leve of personal adornment which befits his"
1488,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"character, he wears a spotted leopard’s hide upon his shoulders."
1489,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Tennyson’s portrait of him, though in a different scene, is thoroughly"
1490,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Homeric--
1491,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1492,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“White-breasted like a star,"
1493,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard’s skin
1494,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Drooped from his shoulder, but his sunny hair"
1495,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Clustered about his temples like a god’s.”
1496,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1497,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Advancing with long strides in the space between the armies, he"
1498,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"challenges the leaders of the Greeks, one and all, to meet him singly in"
1499,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,mortal combat. Menelaus hears the boast. “Like a hungry lion springing
1500,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"on his prey,” he leaps full-armed from his chariot, exulting in the"
1501,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,thought that now at last his personal vengeance shall be gratified. But
1502,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,conscience makes a coward of Paris. He starts back--“as a man that sees
1503,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"a serpent in his path”--the godlike visage grows pale, the knees"
1504,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"tremble, and the Trojan champion draws back under the shelter of his"
1505,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,friends from the gallant hero whom he has so bitterly wronged. The Roman
1506,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,historian Livy--a poet in prose--had surely this passage in his mind
1507,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"when he described Sextus Tarquinius, the dishonourer of Lucretia,"
1508,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"quailing, as no Roman of his blood and rank would otherwise have"
1509,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"quailed, when young Valerius dashes out from the Roman lines to engage"
1510,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,him. The moral teaching of the heathen poet on such points is far higher
1511,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,than that of the medieval romancers with whom he has so many points in
1512,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,common. Sir Tristram of Lyonnois has no such scruples of conscience in
1513,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"meeting King Mark. Lancelot, indeed, will not fight with Arthur; but the"
1514,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,very nobility of character with which the unknown author of that
1515,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,striking impersonation has endowed him is in itself the highest of all
1516,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"wrongs against morality, in that it steals the reader’s sympathies for"
1517,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the wrong-doer instead of for the injured husband. Shakespeare, as is"
1518,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"his wont, strikes the higher key. It is the consciousness of guilt which"
1519,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,makes Macbeth half quail before Macduff--
1520,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1521,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,“Of all men else have I avoided thee:
1522,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,But get thee back--my soul is too much charged
1523,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,With blood of thine already.
1524,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,...I will not fight with thee.”
1525,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1526,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Paris withdraws into the Trojan ranks, and there encounters Hector. As"
1527,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"has been already said, the poet assumes at the outset, on the part of"
1528,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"his audience, at least such knowledge of his _dramatis personæ_ as to"
1529,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,make a formal introduction unnecessary. Hector is the noblest of all the
1530,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"sons of Priam, the shield and bulwark of his countrymen throughout the"
1531,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"long years of the war. Achilles is the hero of the Iliad, and to him"
1532,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Homer assigns the palm of strength and valour; but, as is not seldom the"
1533,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"case in fiction, the author has painted the rival hero so well that our"
1534,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,sympathies are at least as frequently found on his side. We almost share
1535,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Juno’s feelings against the Trojans when they are represented by Paris;
1536,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"but when Hector comes into the field, our hearts half go over to the"
1537,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,enemy. His character will be touched upon more fully hereafter: for the
1538,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"present, it must discover itself in the course of the story. He throws"
1539,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,himself in the way of Paris in his cowardly retreat; and in spite of the
1540,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,fraternal feeling which is so remarkably strong amongst Homer’s
1541,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"heroes,--in Hector and his brothers almost as much as in Agamemnon and"
1542,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Menelaus,--shame and disgust at his present poltroonery now mingle"
1543,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,themselves with a righteous hatred of the selfish lust which has
1544,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,plunged his country into a bloody war--
1545,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1546,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Was it for this, or with such heart as now,"
1547,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,O’er the wide billows with a chosen band
1548,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Thou sailedst, and with violated vow"
1549,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Didst bring thy fair wife from the Apian strand,"
1550,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Torn from the house of men of warlike hand,"
1551,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"And a great sorrow for thy father’s head,"
1552,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Troy town, and all the people of the land,"
1553,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"By thine inhospitable offence hast bred,"
1554,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Thus for the enemy’s sport, thine own confusion dread?"
1555,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1556,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Lo, now thou cowerest, and wilt not abide"
1557,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Fierce Menelaus--thou hadst known, I ween,"
1558,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Soon of what man thou hast the blooming bride!
1559,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Poor had the profit of thy harp then been,"
1560,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Vain Aphrodite’s gifts, thy hair, thy mien,"
1561,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,He mangling in the dust thy fallen brow.
1562,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"But there is no wrong to the Trojans keen,"
1563,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,And they are lambs in Spirit; or else hadst thou
1564,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Worn, for thine evil works, a cloke of stone ere now.” W."
1565,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1566,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Paris has the grace to admit the justice of his brother’s rebuke.
1567,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Hector, he confesses, is far the better soldier; only he pleads, with a"
1568,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"self-complacency which he never loses, that grace of person, and a"
1569,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"smooth tongue, and a taste for music, are nothing less than the gifts of"
1570,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the gods--that, in fact, it is not his fault that he is so irresistible."
1571,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"He ends, however, with an offer which is far more to Hector’s mind. Let"
1572,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"open lists be pitched in sight of both armies, and he will engage"
1573,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Menelaus in single combat; Helen and her wealth shall be the prize of
1574,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,victory.
1575,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1576,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,It is a proposal at which Hector’s heart rejoices. He checks at once the
1577,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"advancing line of the Trojans, and steps out himself to the front. The"
1578,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Greeks bend their bows at him, but Agamemnon understands his motions,"
1579,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,and bids them hold their hands. It is a fair challenge which the Trojan
1580,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"prince comes to make on behalf of Paris. Menelaus accepts it, in a few"
1581,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,plain and gallant words--he is no orator:--
1582,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1583,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,“Hear now my answer; in this quarrel I
1584,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,May claim the chiefest share; and now I hope
1585,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Trojans and Greeks may see the final close
1586,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Of all the labours ye so long have borne,"
1587,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,T’ avenge my wrong at Paris’ hand sustained.
1588,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"And of us two whiche’er is doomed to death,"
1589,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,So let him die! the rest depart in peace.” (D.)
1590,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1591,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"A truce is agreed upon, to abide the result of this appeal of battle. A"
1592,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"messenger from Olympus--Iris, goddess of the Rainbow--comes to warn"
1593,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Helen of the impending duel. And this introduces one of the most
1594,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"beautiful passages in the whole Iliad, to modern taste. Its sentiment"
1595,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,and pathos are perfectly level and quiet; but as a natural and life-like
1596,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,yet highly-wrought portrait of a scene in what we may call the social
1597,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"drama, it stands almost without equal or parallel in classical"
1598,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,literature.
1599,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1600,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Helen--the fatal cause of the war, the object of such violent passions"
1601,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,and such bitter taunts--is sitting pensively in the palace of her royal
1602,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"father-in-law, writing her own miserable story. She is writing it--not"
1603,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"in a three-volumed novel, as a lady who had a private history, more or"
1604,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"less creditable, would write it now, but--in a golden tapestry, in which"
1605,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,more laborious form it was in those days not unfrequent to write
1606,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,sensational biographies. Iris urges her to be present at the show. The
1607,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"whole reads like the tale of some medieval tournament, except that Helen"
1608,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,herself is the prize of victory as well as the Queen of Beauty. Attended
1609,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"by her maidens, she goes down to the place where the aged Priam, like"
1610,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the kings of the Old Testament history, “sits in the gate” surrounded"
1611,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"by the elders of his city. It is the “Scæan,” or “left-hand” gate, which"
1612,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"opens towards the camp of the enemy, and commands a view of their lines."
1613,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,We have had no word as yet of the marvellous beauty of Helen. There is
1614,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"no attempt to describe it throughout the whole of the poem. But here, in"
1615,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"a few masterly touches, introduced in the simplest and most natural"
1616,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"manner, Homer does more than describe it, when he tells us its effects."
1617,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,The old men break off their talk as the beautiful stranger draws near.
1618,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,They had seen her often enough before; the fatal face and form must have
1619,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"been well known in the streets and palaces of Troy, however retired a"
1620,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,life Helen might well have thought it becoming in her unhappy position
1621,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,to lead. But the fair vision comes upon their eyes with a new and
1622,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,ever-increasing enchantment. They say each to the other as they look
1623,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"upon her, “It is no blame to Greeks or Trojans to fight for such a"
1624,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"woman--she is worth all the ten years of war; still, let her embark and"
1625,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"go home, lest we and our children suffer more for her.” Even the"
1626,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"earliest critics, when the finer shades of criticism were little"
1627,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"understood, were forcibly struck with the art of the poet in selecting"
1628,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,his witnesses for the defence. The Roman Quintilian had said nearly all
1629,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,that modern taste has since confirmed. He bids the reader mark who gives
1630,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"this testimony to Helen’s charms. Not the infatuated Paris, who has set"
1631,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,his own honour and his country’s welfare at nought for the sake of an
1632,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"unlawful passion; not some young Trojan, who might naturally be ready to"
1633,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,vow “the world well lost” for such a woman; nor yet any of the vulgar
1634,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"crowd, easily impressed, and always extravagant in its praise or blame;"
1635,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"but these grave and reverend seniors, men of cold passions and calm"
1636,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"judgment, fathers whose sons were fighting and falling for this woman’s"
1637,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"sake, and even Priam himself, whose very crown and kingdom she had"
1638,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"brought in deadly peril. He receives her, as she draws near, with gentle"
1639,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"courtesy. Plainly, in his estimation, her unhappy position does not"
1640,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,involve necessarily shame or disgrace. This opens one of the difficult
1641,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"questions of the moral doctrine of the Iliad, which can only be"
1642,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,understood by bearing in mind the supernatural machinery of the poem. To
1643,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the modern reader, the character of Helen, and the light in which she is"
1644,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"regarded alike by Greeks and Trojans, present an anomaly in morals which"
1645,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"is highly unsatisfactory. It is not as if Homer, like the worst writers"
1646,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"of the Italian school, set marriage vows at nought, and made a jest of"
1647,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,unchastity. Far otherwise; the heathen bard on such points took an
1648,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,infinitely higher tone than many so-called Christian poets. The
1649,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"difficulty lies in the fact that throughout the poem, while the crime is"
1650,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"reprobated, the criminal meets with forbearance, and even sympathy. Our"
1651,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,first natural impulse with regard to Helen is to look upon her much in
1652,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the light in which she herself, in one of her bitter confessions, says"
1653,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,she is looked upon by the mass of the Trojans:--
1654,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1655,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Throughout wide Troy I see no friendly eye,"
1656,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,And Trojans shudder as I pass them by.”
1657,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1658,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"But this feeling, we must remember, arose much more from her being the"
1659,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"cause of all the miseries of the siege, than from her having left her"
1660,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Greek husband. Priam and Hector--who have certainly not a lower
1661,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"morality, and a higher nobility and unselfishness, than the mass of"
1662,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"their countrymen--show no such feeling against her; on the contrary,"
1663,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,they treat her with scrupulous delicacy and consideration. So also the
1664,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,leaders of the Greek forces betray no consciousness that they are
1665,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"fighting, after all, for a worthless woman; rather, she is a prize to be"
1666,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"reclaimed, and Menelaus himself is ready from the first to receive her"
1667,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,back again. How is this? Some have understood the poet to represent her
1668,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,abduction from her home to have been forcible--that she was carried off
1669,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,by Paris entirely against her will; but even allowing this (which is not
1670,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"consistent with many passages in the poem), it would not excuse or"
1671,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,palliate her voluntary acceptance of such a degraded position throughout
1672,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,the subsequent story. The real explanation is given in a few words by
1673,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Priam in the scene before us.
1674,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1675,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Not thee I blame,"
1676,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,But to the gods I owe this woful war.”
1677,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1678,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"In Homer’s sight, as in Priam’s, she is the victim of Venus. She is “the"
1679,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"victim of passion,” only in a more literal and personal sense than we"
1680,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"use the expression. Love, lawful or unlawful, was a divine--that is, a"
1681,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"supernatural--force, to the mind of the poet. The spells of Venus are"
1682,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,irresistible: that fatal gift of beauty is the right by which the
1683,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"goddess takes possession of her, and leads her captive at her evil will."
1684,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Helen herself feels her own degradation far more deeply, in fact, than"
1685,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,any one else seems to feel it; no one uses any expressions about her
1686,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"half so bitter as those which she applies to herself; “shameless,”"
1687,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“bringer of sorrow,” “whose name shall be a by-word and a reproach,” are"
1688,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,the terms she uses--
1689,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1690,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Oh that the day my mother gave me birth,"
1691,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Some storm had on the mountains cast me forth!”
1692,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1693,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,We must judge Homer’s characters with reference to the light of his
1694,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,religious creed--if creed it were--or at least with reference to the
1695,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"supernatural element employed in the Iliad. We shall be safe, then, in"
1696,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"seeing Helen through Homer’s eyes. We separate her unconsciously, as he"
1697,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"does, from her fault. Look upon that as the poet does, as she does"
1698,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"herself, as Priam and Hector and Menelaus do, as her fate, her"
1699,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"misfortune, the weird that she has been doomed to dree,--and then, what"
1700,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,a graceful womanly character remains! Gentle and daughterlike to the
1701,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"aged Priam, humble and tearful in the presence of her noble and generous"
1702,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"brother-in-law Hector, as disdainful as she dares to be to her ignoble"
1703,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"lord and lover,--tender, respectful, regretful, towards the gallant"
1704,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,husband she has deserted.
1705,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1706,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"So she comes in all her grace and beauty, and takes her seat by the old"
1707,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"King’s side upon the watch-tower, looking out upon the camp of the"
1708,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Greeks. He bids her tell him the names of such of the kings and chiefs
1709,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"as she can recognise. One there is who seems indeed a “king of men,” by"
1710,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,the grace of nature. There are taller warriors in the host; but none of
1711,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"such majestic mien and right royal bearing. It is, indeed, Agamemnon the"
1712,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"son of Atreus, as Helen informs him,--"
1713,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1714,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Wide-reigning, mighty monarch, ruler good,"
1715,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"And valiant warrior; in my husband’s name,"
1716,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Lost as I am, I called him brother once.”"
1717,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1718,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Another chief attracts Priam’s attention, as he strides along in front"
1719,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"of the lines. Less in stature than Agamemnon, he is broader in the chest"
1720,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"and shoulders. Helen knows him well. It is Ulysses, son of Laertes,"
1721,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,“the man of many wiles;” nursed among the rugged cliffs of his island
1722,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"kingdom of Ithaca, but already a traveller well versed in the ways of"
1723,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"men, the stratagems of war, and the counsels of princes. He is"
1724,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"recognised, too, now that Helen names him, by some of the Trojan elders;"
1725,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"for he, it must be remembered (and Homer assumes that we know it), had"
1726,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,accompanied Menelaus in the embassy to demand Helen’s restitution. Old
1727,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Antenor, now sitting by Priam’s side, well remembers the remarkable"
1728,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"stranger, whom he had lodged and entertained as a public guest. The"
1729,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,picture he draws of him is one of the most graphic and individual of all
1730,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Homer’s characters.
1731,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1732,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“For hither when on thine account to treat,"
1733,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Brave Menelaus and Ulysses came,"
1734,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"I lodged them in my house, and loved them both,"
1735,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,And studied well the form and mind of each.
1736,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"As they with Trojans mixed in social guise,"
1737,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"When both were standing, o’er his comrade high"
1738,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,With broad-set shoulders Menelaus stood:
1739,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Seated, Ulysses was the nobler form:"
1740,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Then, in the great assembly, when to all"
1741,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Their public speech and argument they framed,"
1742,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"In fluent language Menelaus spoke,"
1743,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"In words though few, yet clear; though young in years,"
1744,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"No wordy babbler, wasteful of his speech:"
1745,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"But when the skilled Ulysses rose to speak,"
1746,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"With downcast visage would he stand, his eyes"
1747,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Bent on the ground; the staff he bore, nor back"
1748,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"He waved, nor forward, but like one untaught,"
1749,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"He held it motionless; who only saw,"
1750,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Would say that he was mad, or void of sense:"
1751,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"But when his chest its deep-toned voice sent forth,"
1752,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"With words that fell like flakes of wintry snow,"
1753,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,No mortal with Ulysses could compare;
1754,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Then, little recked we of his outward show.” (D.)"
1755,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1756,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"A third hero catches the eye of the Trojan king, as well he may--a"
1757,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"leader like Saul, “taller by the head and shoulders than the rest"
1758,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,of the people”--and he asks Helen to name him also. This is Ajax of
1759,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Crete, son of Telamon, a giant chieftain, “the bulwark of the Greeks,”"
1760,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"represented here in the Iliad as easy-tempered and somewhat heavy, as"
1761,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"it is the wont of giants to be, degraded by medieval and modern poets"
1762,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"into a mere bulk without brains. “Mars’ idiot,” Shakespeare calls him,"
1763,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,“who has not so much wit as would stop the eye of Helen’s needle.”
1764,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Shirley, in his ‘Ajax and Ulysses,’ carries out the same popular"
1765,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,notion:--
1766,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1767,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“And now I look on Ajax Telamon,"
1768,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,I may compare him to some spacious building;
1769,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"His body holds vast rooms of entertainment,"
1770,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,And lower parts maintain the offices;
1771,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Only the garret, his exalted head,"
1772,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Useless for wise receipt, is filled with lumber.”"
1773,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1774,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"By the side of Ajax Helen also marks King Idomeneus of Crete, a frequent"
1775,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,guest in the palace of Menelaus in happier times; for the court of
1776,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Sparta, as will be seen hereafter in the Odyssey, was in these heroic"
1777,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,days a centre of civilisation and refinement. Two chiefs Helen’s anxious
1778,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"eyes vainly try to discern amongst the crowd of her countrymen,--"
1779,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1780,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“My own two brethren, and my mother’s sons,"
1781,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Castor and Pollux; Castor, horseman bold,"
1782,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Pollux, unmatched in pugilistic skill;"
1783,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,In Lacedæmon have they stayed behind?
1784,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Or can it be, in ocean-going ships"
1785,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"That they have come indeed, but shame to join"
1786,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"The fight of warriors, fearful of the shame"
1787,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,And deep disgrace that on my name attend?” (D.)
1788,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1789,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Helen’s self-reproachful surmises have not reached the truth. The “Great
1790,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Twin Brethren,” who had once already (so the ancient legend said)"
1791,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,rescued their beautiful sister in her girlhood from the hands of
1792,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Theseus, who had been amongst the mighty hunters of the Calydonian boar,"
1793,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"and had formed part of the adventurous crew of the Argo, had finished"
1794,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,their mortal warfare years before in a raid in Messenia; but to reappear
1795,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"as demigods in Greek and Roman legend,--the spirit horsemen who rallied"
1796,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the Roman line in the great fight with the Latins at the Lake Regillus,"
1797,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the “shining stars” who lighted the sailors on the stormy Adriatic, and"
1798,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,gave their names to the ship in which St Paul was cast away.
1799,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1800,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"“Back comes the chief in triumph,"
1801,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Who, in the hour of fight,"
1802,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Hath seen the Great Twin Brethren
1803,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,In harness on his right.
1804,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Safe comes the ship to harbour,"
1805,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Through billows and through gales,"
1806,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,If once the Great Twin Brethren
1807,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Sit shining on the sails.”[15]
1808,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1809,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,This picturesque dialogue between Priam and his fascinating guest is
1810,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,interrupted far too soon for the reader’s complete enjoyment--somewhat
1811,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"too abruptly, indeed, for its perfection. One would like to have heard"
1812,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Helen’s estimate of the other leaders of the Greeks; of Diomed, of the"
1813,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"lesser Ajax, of Nestor, of Mnestheus the Athenian; and it is hardly"
1814,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,possible not to fancy that the scene has been left by the poet
1815,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"incomplete, or that some portion has been lost past recovery. The"
1816,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"tragedian Æschylus, who was full of the true Homeric spirit, carried out"
1817,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,the idea to what seems its natural completion in a remarkable scene of
1818,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"‘The Seven Chiefs against Thebes,’ to which we may hope to introduce"
1819,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"our readers more fully hereafter. Euripides, in his ‘Phœnissæ,’ adopts"
1820,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,the very same machinery; and Tasso has also imitated the scene in his
1821,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"‘Jerusalem Delivered,’[16] where he brings Erminia on the walls,"
1822,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,pointing out to King Aladine the persons of the most renowned of the
1823,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,besieging knights.
1824,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1825,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,The interruption is as little satisfactory to Priam as to the reader. A
1826,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,herald summons the king of Troy to a conference in the mid-space between
1827,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the city walls and the enemy’s leaguer, in order to ratify the"
1828,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"armistice, while Paris and Menelaus decide their quarrel in single"
1829,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"combat. The old man mounts his chariot, “shuddering,” as foreboding the"
1830,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"defeat and death of his son. Agamemnon and Ulysses on the one side,"
1831,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Priam and Antenor on the other, duly slay the sacrificial lambs, and"
1832,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"make joint appeal to Jupiter, the Avenger of oaths, pouring the red wine"
1833,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"upon the earth with solemn imprecation, that so may flow forth the"
1834,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,heart’s blood of him who on either part shall break the truce. And the
1835,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"god listens as before, but does not accept the appeal. Priam withdraws,"
1836,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,for he cannot bear to be a spectator of his son’s peril. Hector and
1837,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Ulysses, precisely in the fashion of the marshals in the tournaments of"
1838,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"chivalry, measure out the lists; the rest of the Greeks lie down on the"
1839,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"ground beside their horses and chariots, while the lots are cast which"
1840,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"shall first throw the spear. The chance falls to Paris. He throws, and"
1841,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,strikes full and fair in the centre of Menelaus’ round shield. But the
1842,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"seasoned bull’s hide turns the point, and it does not penetrate. Next"
1843,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,comes the turn of Menelaus. Paris has ventured no appeal to heaven; but
1844,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,the Greek king lifts his voice in prayer to Jupiter for vengeance on
1845,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the traitor who has so abused his hospitality, before he poises his long"
1846,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"lance carefully and hurls it at his enemy. Right through shield,"
1847,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"breastplate, and linen vest goes the good Greek weapon; but Paris leans"
1848,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"back to avoid it, and it only grazes him. Menelaus rushes forward, sword"
1849,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"in hand, and smites a downright blow on Paris’ crest. But the Trojan"
1850,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"helmet proves of better quality than the shield, and the Greek blade"
1851,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"flies in shivers. Maddened by his double failure, he rushes on his"
1852,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"enemy, and seizing him by the horse-hair crest, drags him off by main"
1853,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,strength towards the ranks of the Greeks. But in this extremity the
1854,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,goddess of love comes to the rescue of her favourite. At her touch the
1855,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"tough bullhide strap of Paris’ head-piece, which was all but choking"
1856,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"him, breaks, and leaves the empty helmet in the hands of Menelaus. He"
1857,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"hurls it amongst his comrades in disappointment and disgust, and rushes"
1858,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"once more in pursuit of Paris. But Venus has wrapt him in a mist, and"
1859,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,carried him off; and while the son of Atreus rushes like a baffled lion
1860,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"up and down the lists in quest of him, while even the Trojans are aiding"
1861,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"in the search, and no man among them would have hidden him--for “they"
1862,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,all hated him like black death”--he is safely laid by the goddess in
1863,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Helen’s chamber. The scene in which she receives him is, like all the"
1864,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"rest of her story, a beautiful contradiction. Her first greeting is"
1865,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,bitter enough. Either her heart has been indeed with Menelaus in the
1866,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,fight--or at least she would have had her present husband come back from
1867,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"the field, dead or alive, in some more honourable fashion--"
1868,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1869,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,“Back from the battle? Would thou there hadst died
1870,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,Beneath a warrior’s arm whom once I called
1871,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,My husband! Vainly didst thou boast erewhile
1872,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Thine arm, thy dauntless courage, and thy spear,"
1873,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,The warlike Menelaus should subdue!
1874,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Go now again, and challenge to the fight"
1875,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,The warlike Menelaus.--Be thou ware!
1876,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"I warn thee, pause, ere madly thou presume"
1877,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,With fair-haired Menelaus to contend!” (D.)
1878,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,
1879,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"Brave words! but still, as of old, the fatal spells of Venus are upon"
1880,THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.,"her, and Paris’ misadventure in the lists is all too soon condoned."

1887,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,THE BROKEN TRUCE.
1888,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1889,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1890,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"The Greeks claim the victory--reasonably, since the Trojan champion has"
1891,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,fled the lists; but again the intrigues of the court of Olympus
1892,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,interfere to interrupt the course of mortal justice. The gods of Homer
1893,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"are not the gods of Epicurus’ creed, who, as our English poet sings,"
1894,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"“lie beside their nectar, careless of mankind.” They are anything but"
1895,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"careless, so far as the affairs of mortals are concerned; but their"
1896,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,interference is regulated by the most selfish motives. Men are the
1897,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,puppets whom they make to dance for their gratification--the counters
1898,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"with which they play their Olympian game, and try to defeat and"
1899,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,checkmate each other. Even the respect which they pay to the mortal who
1900,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,is regular in the matter of offering sacrifices is entirely selfish--it
1901,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,seems to be merely the sensual appetite for fat roasts and rich savours.
1902,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"They are commonly influenced by jealousy, pique, revenge, or"
1903,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"favouritism; and where they do punish the wrongdoer, it is far more"
1904,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,often from a sense of _lèse-majesté_--a slight offered to some cause
1905,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,which is under their special protection--than from any moral indignation
1906,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"at wrong itself. When the scene opens in the fourth book of the poem,"
1907,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,it seems to pass at once from serious melodrama to broad comedy; and but
1908,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"that these dwellers in Olympus really rule the fortunes of the tale, it"
1909,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,would be scarcely possible not to believe that the poet so intended it.
1910,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1911,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"We are introduced again, then, to Olympus; and, as before, to a quarrel"
1912,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,among the Immortals. It is Jove this time who is the aggressor. He has
1913,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"seen the result of the combat, and taunts Juno with the double patronage"
1914,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"extended to the Greeks by herself and Minerva--which, after all, has"
1915,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"failed--while Venus, more active and energetic, has rescued her"
1916,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"favourite. However, he awards the victory to Menelaus; and suggests, as"
1917,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"a solution to all disputes and difficulties, that now Helen should be"
1918,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"given up, the Greeks go home, and so the fate of Troy be averted. At the"
1919,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"thought of her enemy thus escaping, the queen of the gods cannot contain"
1920,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"her rage. Jupiter gives way. He loves Troy much, but domestic peace and"
1921,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"quietness more. He warns his queen, however, that if he now consents to"
1922,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"give up Troy to her insatiable revenge, she shall not stand in his way"
1923,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"hereafter, in case some community of mortals who may be her especial"
1924,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"favourites shall incur his royal displeasure. And Juno, with that utter"
1925,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"indifference to human suffering, or human justice, which characterises"
1926,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"the deities of Olympus, makes answer in these words:--"
1927,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1928,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,“Three cities there are dearest to my heart;
1929,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Argos, and Sparta, and the ample streets"
1930,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Of rich Mycenæ; work on them thy will--
1931,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Destroy them, if thine anger they incur--"
1932,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,I will not interpose nor hinder thee.”
1933,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1934,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"In furtherance of this strange compact, Minerva is once more sent down"
1935,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,to the plains of Troy. Her mission now is to incite the Trojans to break
1936,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"the truce by some overt act, and thus not only renew the war, but put"
1937,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,themselves plainly in the wrong. Clothing herself in the human shape of
1938,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"the son of old Antenor, she mingles in the Trojan ranks, and addresses"
1939,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,herself to the cunning bowman Pandarus. His character in the Iliad has
1940,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"nothing in common with the “Sir Pandarus of Troy,” whose name, as the"
1941,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"base uncle of Cressida, has passed into an unwholesome by-word, and whom"
1942,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Lydgate, Chaucer, and, lastly, Shakespeare, borrowed from the medieval"
1943,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"romancers. Here he is but an archer of known skill, somewhat given to"
1944,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"display, with his bow of polished ibex-horns tipped with gold, and vain"
1945,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"of his reputation, whom the goddess easily tempts to end the long war at"
1946,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"once by a timely shot, and win immortal renown by taking off Menelaus."
1947,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"With a brief prayer and a vow of a hecatomb to Apollo, the god of the"
1948,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,bow--who is supposed to be as ready as the rest of the immortals to abet
1949,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,an act of treachery on such conditions--Pandarus ensconces himself
1950,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"behind the shields of his comrades, and choosing out his arrow with the"
1951,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"same care which we read of in the great exploits of more modern bowmen,"
1952,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,he discharges it point-blank at the unsuspecting Menelaus. The shaft
1953,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"flies true enough, but Minerva is at hand to avert the actual peril from"
1954,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,the Greek hero: she turns the arrow aside--
1955,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1956,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"“As when a mother from her infant’s cheek,"
1957,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Wrapt in sweet slumbers, brushes off a fly.”"
1958,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1959,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,It is a pretty simile; but the result is not so entirely harmless. The
1960,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"arrow strikes in the belt, and so meets the double resistance of belt"
1961,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"and corslet. It draws blood, nevertheless, in a stream; and both"
1962,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Menelaus and Agamemnon at first fear that the wound is mortal;--
1963,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1964,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,“Great Agamemnon shuddered as he saw
1965,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"The crimson blood-drops issuing from the wound,"
1966,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Shuddered the warlike Menelaus’ self;
1967,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,But when the sinew and the arrow-head
1968,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"He saw projecting, back his spirit came."
1969,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Then, deeply groaning, Agamemnon spoke,"
1970,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"As Menelaus by the hand he held,"
1971,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"And with him groaned his comrades; ‘Brother dear,"
1972,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Fatal to thee hath been the oath I swore,"
1973,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,When thou stoodst forth alone for Greece to fight;
1974,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Wounded by Trojans, who their plighted troth"
1975,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Have trodden under foot.’” (D.)
1976,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
1977,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Two points are remarkable in this passage: first, the tenderness which"
1978,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Agamemnon shows towards his younger brother, even to the point of"
1979,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"self-reproach at having allowed him to fight Paris at all, though in a"
1980,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,quarrel which was so thoroughly his own. His expressions of grief and
1981,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,remorse at the thought of going home to Greece without him (which run to
1982,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"considerable length), though somewhat tinged with selfishness, inasmuch"
1983,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"as he feels his own honour at stake, are much more like the feeling of a"
1984,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"parent than of an elder brother. Again, the picture of Menelaus"
1985,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,“shuddering” at his own wound--so sensitive to the dread of death that
1986,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"he apparently all but faints, until he is reassured by finding that the"
1987,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,barb of the arrow has not really penetrated--is utterly inconsistent
1988,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"with our English notions of a hero. We have to bear in mind, here and"
1989,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"elsewhere, that these Greek heroes, of whatever race we are to suppose"
1990,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"them to be, are of an entirely different temperament to us cold and"
1991,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"self-restrained northerns. They are highly sensitive to bodily pain,"
1992,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"very much given to groans and tears, and very much afraid of death for"
1993,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"themselves, however indifferent to human life in the case of others."
1994,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Death, to these sensuous Greeks, was an object of dread and aversion,"
1995,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,chiefly because it implied to their minds something like annihilation.
1996,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,However vivid in some passages of their poets is the description of
1997,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"those happy Elysian fields where the souls of heroes dwelt, the popular"
1998,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,belief gave to the disembodied spirit but a shadowy and colourless
1999,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,existence.
2000,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
2001,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"The wound is soon stanched by the aid of the skilful leech Machaon, son"
2002,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"of Æsculapius (and therefore grandson of Apollo “the Healer”), but who"
2003,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"is a warrior and chieftain as well as the rest, though he has placed his"
2004,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"skill at the service of Agamemnon. The King of Men himself, as soon as"
2005,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"his brother’s hurt is tended, rushes along the lines, rousing chiefs and"
2006,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"clansmen to avenge the treachery of the enemy. Idomeneus of Crete, Ajax"
2007,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"the Greater and the Less, Mnestheus of Athens, Ulysses, Diomed--to all"
2008,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"in turn he makes his passionate appeal; to some, in language which they"
2009,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"are inclined to resent, as implying that they were disinclined for the"
2010,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,combat. Diomed and Sthenelus he even reminds of the brave deeds of their
2011,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"fathers Tydeus and Capaneus in the great siege of Thebes, and stings"
2012,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"them with the taunt, that the sons will never win the like renown."
2013,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Diomed hears in silence; but the son of Capaneus inherits, with all the"
2014,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"bravery, something of the insolence of the chief who swore that “with or"
2015,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,without the gods” he would burn Thebes: he answers the great king in
2016,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,words which have yet a certain nobility in their self-assertion--
2017,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
2018,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"“Atrides, lie not, when thou know’st the truth;"
2019,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,We hold ourselves far better than our sires;
2020,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"We took the strength of seven-gated Thebes,"
2021,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Though with a smaller host we stormed her towers,"
2022,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Strong in heaven’s omens and the help of Jove;
2023,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,For them--their own presumption was their fall.”
2024,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
2025,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,All the leaders of the Greeks eagerly marshal their forces at the King’s
2026,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"call. Nestor’s experienced counsel orders the line of battle--so well,"
2027,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,that subsequent commanders were fain to take a lesson from it.
2028,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,
2029,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"“In the front rank, with chariot and with horse,"
2030,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"He placed the mounted warriors; in the rear,"
2031,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Num’rous and brave, a cloud of infantry,"
2032,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Compactly massed, to stem the tide of war."
2033,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Between the two he placed th’ inferior troops,"
2034,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,That e’en against their will they needs must fight.
2035,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"The horsemen first he charged, and bade them keep"
2036,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Their horses well in hand, nor wildly rush"
2037,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Amid the tumult: ‘See,’ he said, ‘that none,"
2038,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"In skill or valour over-confident,"
2039,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"Advance before his comrades, nor alone"
2040,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Retire; for so your lines were easier forced;
2041,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"But ranging each beside a hostile car,"
2042,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Thrust with your spears; for such the better way;
2043,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,"By men so disciplined, in elder days,"
2044,THE BROKEN TRUCE.,Were lofty walls and fencèd towers destroyed.’” (D.)

2051,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.
2052,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2053,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2054,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"As before, while the Greek line advances in perfect silence, the Trojans"
2055,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,make their onset with loud shouts and a clamour of discordant war-cries
2056,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"in many tongues. Mars animates the Trojans, Minerva the Greeks; while"
2057,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Fear and Panic hover over the two armies, and Strife--whom the poet"
2058,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,describes in words which are the very echo of Solomon’s proverb--“The
2059,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water”--
2060,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2061,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“With humble crest at first, anon her head,"
2062,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"While yet she treads the earth, affronts the skies.”"
2063,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2064,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The two armies close in battle, only embittered by the broken truce. The"
2065,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"description is a good specimen of the poet’s powers, and Lord Derby’s"
2066,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,translation is sufficiently close:--
2067,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2068,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Then rose the mingled shouts and groans of men
2069,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Slaying and slain; the earth ran red with blood.
2070,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,As when descending from the mountain’s brow
2071,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Two wintry torrents from their copious source
2072,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Pour downwards to the narrow pass, where meet"
2073,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Their mingled waters in some deep ravine,"
2074,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Their weight of flood, on the far mountain’s side"
2075,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The shepherd hears the roar; so loud arose
2076,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The shouts and yells of those commingling hosts.”[17]
2077,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2078,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Then begins one of those remarkable descriptions of a series of single
2079,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"combats between warriors of note on either side, in which Homer delights"
2080,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,and excels. It must be confessed that they are somewhat wearisome to a
2081,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"modern reader; although, as has been well observed, the details of"
2082,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"attack and defence, wounds and death, are varied in a fashion which"
2083,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,shows that the artist was thoroughly master of his work; and it is even
2084,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,said that in the physical results assigned to each particular wound he
2085,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"has shown no mean knowledge of anatomy. Still, the continuous catalogue"
2086,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,of ghastly wounds and dying agonies is uncongenial with our more refined
2087,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,sympathies. But it was quite in harmony with the tastes of ruder days.
2088,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,We find the same apparent repetition of single combats in the medieval
2089,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,romances--notably in Mallory’s King Arthur; and they were probably not
2090,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the least popular portions of the tale. Even a stronger parallel case
2091,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,might be found in the description of a prize-fight in the columns of
2092,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"sporting newspapers, not so many years ago, when each particular blow"
2093,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"and its results, up to “Round 102,” were graphically described in"
2094,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"language quite as figurative, if not so poetic, as Homer’s; and found,"
2095,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"we must suppose, a sufficient circle of readers to whom it was not only"
2096,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,intelligible but highly interesting. The poet who recites--as we must
2097,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,suppose Homer to have done--must above everything else excite and
2098,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,interest his audience: his lay must be rich in incident; and to an
2099,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"audience who were all more or less warlike, no incidents could be so"
2100,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,exciting as the details of battle. There is much savageness in Homer’s
2101,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,combats; but savageness is to the taste of men whose only means of
2102,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"excitement is through their grosser senses, and a love of the horrible"
2103,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,in fact or fiction is by no means extinct even in our own day.
2104,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2105,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Young Antilochus, the son of Nestor’s old age, draws the first blood in"
2106,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the battle. He kills Echepolus.
2107,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2108,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Beneath his horsehair-plumèd helmet’s peak
2109,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The sharp spear struck; deep in his forehead fixed,"
2110,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"It pierced the bone: then darkness veiled his eyes,"
2111,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And, like a tower, amid the press he fell.”"
2112,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2113,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Over his dead body the combat grows furious--the Greeks endeavouring to
2114,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"drag him off to strip his armour, the Trojans to prevent it. The armour"
2115,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"of a vanquished enemy was, in these combats, something like what an"
2116,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"enemy’s scalp is to the Indian “brave;” to carry it off in triumph, and"
2117,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"hang it up in their own tents as a trophy, was the great ambition of the"
2118,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"slayer and his friends. Ajax, too, slays his man--spearing him right"
2119,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,through from breast to shoulder: and the tall Trojan falls like a
2120,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,poplar--
2121,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2122,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Which with his biting axe the wheelwright fells.”
2123,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2124,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Ulysses, roused by the death of a friend who is killed in trying to"
2125,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"carry off this last body, rushes to the front, and poising his spear,"
2126,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,looks round to choose his victim. The foremost of his enemies recoil;
2127,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"but he drives his weapon right through the temples of Demophoon, a"
2128,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"natural son of Priam, as he sits high in his chariot. The Trojans waver;"
2129,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"even Hector gives ground; the Greeks cheer, and some carry off the"
2130,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"bodies, while the rest press forward. It is going hard with Troy, when"
2131,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Apollo, who sits watching the battle from the citadel, calls loudly to"
2132,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,their troops to remember that “there is no Achilles in the field
2133,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"to-day.” So the fight is renewed, Minerva cheering on the Greeks, as"
2134,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Apollo does the Trojans.
2135,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2136,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Diomed, the gallant son of Tydeus, now becomes the hero of the day. His"
2137,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"exploits occupy, indeed, so large a portion of the next book of the"
2138,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"poem, that it was known as “The Deeds of Diomed,” and would form,"
2139,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"according to one theory, a separate romance or lay of itself, exactly as"
2140,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,some portions of the Arthurian romance have for their exclusive hero
2141,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"some one renowned Knight of the Round Table, as Tristram or Lancelot."
2142,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Diomed fights under supernatural colours. Minerva herself not only
2143,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"inspires him with indomitable courage, but sheds over his whole person a"
2144,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,halo of celestial radiance before which the bravest Trojan might well
2145,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,recoil--
2146,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2147,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Forth from his helm and shield a fiery light
2148,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"There flashed, like autumn’s star, that brightest shines"
2149,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,When newly risen from his ocean bath.”
2150,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2151,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Once more the prince of archers, Pandarus the Lycian, comes to the"
2152,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"rescue of the discomfited Trojans. He bends his bow against Diomed, who"
2153,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"is now fighting on foot, and the arrow flies true to its mark. He sees"
2154,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"it strike deep into the shoulder, and the red blood streams out visibly"
2155,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"over the breastplate. Elated by his success, he turns round and shouts"
2156,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,his triumphant rallying-cry to the Trojans--“The bravest of the Greeks
2157,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,is wounded to the death!” But his exultation is premature. Diomed gets
2158,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"him back to his chariot, and calls on his faithful friend and charioteer"
2159,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Sthenelus to draw the arrow from the wound. The blood wells out fast,"
2160,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,as the barb is withdrawn; but the hero puts up a brief prayer to his
2161,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"guardian goddess for strength yet to avenge him of his adversary, whose"
2162,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,exulting boast he has just heard. Minerva hears. By some rapid celestial
2163,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"pharmacy she heals the wound at once, and gives him fresh strength and"
2164,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"vigour, adding these words of encouragement and warning:--"
2165,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2166,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Go fearless onward, Diomed, to meet"
2167,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The Trojan hosts; for I within thy breast
2168,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Thy father’s dauntless courage have infused,"
2169,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Such as of old in Tydeus’ bosom dwelt,"
2170,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Bold horseman, buckler-clad; and from thine eyes"
2171,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The film that dimmed them I have purged away,[18]"
2172,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,That thou mayest well ’twixt gods and men discern.
2173,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"If then some god make trial of thy force,"
2174,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,With other of the Immortals fight thou not;
2175,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"But should Jove’s daughter Venus dare the fray,"
2176,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Thou need’st not shun at her to cast thy spear.” (D.)
2177,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2178,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,With redoubled vigour and fury the hero returns to the battle; and again
2179,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the Trojans’ names, to each of which the poet contrives to give some"
2180,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"touch of individual character, swell the list of his victims. Æneas"
2181,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"marks his terrible career, and goes to seek for Pandarus. He points out"
2182,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"to him the movements of the Greek champion, and bids him try upon his"
2183,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,person the far-famed skill that had so nearly turned the fate of war in
2184,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the case of Menelaus. Pandarus tells him of his late unsuccessful
2185,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"attempt, and declares his full belief that some glamour of more than"
2186,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,mortal power has made Diomed invulnerable to human weapons. He bitterly
2187,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"regrets, as he tells Æneas, that he did not follow the counsels of his"
2188,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"father Lycaon, and bring with him to the campaign, like other chiefs of"
2189,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"his rank, some of those noble steeds of whom eleven pair stand always in"
2190,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"his father’s stalls, “champing the white barley and the spelt.” He had"
2191,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"feared, in truth, that they might lack provender in the straits of the"
2192,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,siege:--
2193,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2194,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Woe worth the day, when from the glittering wall,"
2195,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Hector to serve, I took my shafts and bow,"
2196,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And to fair Ilion, from my father’s hall,"
2197,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Captain of men, did with my Lycians go!"
2198,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"If ever I return, if ever I know"
2199,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"My country, my dear wife, my home again,"
2200,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Let me fall headless to an enemy’s blow,"
2201,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Save the red blaze of fire these arms contain!” (W.)
2202,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2203,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Æneas bids him mount with him into his chariot, and together they will"
2204,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"encounter this redoubtable Greek. Pandarus takes the spear and shield,"
2205,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"while Æneas guides the horses. Diomed is still fighting on foot, when"
2206,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Sthenelus, who attends him with the chariot, sees the two hostile chiefs"
2207,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"bearing down upon him. He begs his comrade to remount, and avoid the"
2208,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,encounter with two such adversaries. Diomed indignantly refuses. He will
2209,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"slay both, with the help of Heaven; and he charges Sthenelus, if such"
2210,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"should be the happy result, to leave his own horses and chariot,"
2211,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"securing the reins carefully to the chariot-front, and make prize of the"
2212,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,far-famed steeds of Æneas--they are descended from the immortal breed
2213,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"bestowed of old by Jupiter upon King Tros. So, on foot still, he awaits"
2214,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"their onset. Pandarus stands high in the chariot with poised weapon,"
2215,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,and hails his enemy as he comes within hurling distance:--
2216,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2217,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Prince, thou art met! though late in vain assailed,"
2218,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The spear may enter where the arrow failed.”
2219,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2220,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"It does enter, and piercing through the tough ox-hide of the shield,"
2221,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"stands fixed in the breastplate. Again, with premature triumph, he"
2222,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,shouts exultingly to Diomed that at last he has got his death-wound. But
2223,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the Greek quietly tells him that he has missed--which assuredly he
2224,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,himself is not going to do. He hurls his spear in turn with fatal aim:
2225,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,and the poet tells us with ghastly detail how it entered beneath the
2226,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"eyeball, and passed down through the “white teeth” and tongue--"
2227,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2228,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Till the bright point looked out beneath the chin”--
2229,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2230,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"and Pandarus the Lycian closes his career, free at least from the"
2231,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,baseness which medieval romances have attached to his name.
2232,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2233,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Æneas, in obedience to the laws of heroic chivalry, at once leaps down"
2234,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,from the chariot to defend against all comers the body of his fallen
2235,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,comrade.
2236,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2237,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“And like a lion fearless in his strength
2238,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Around the corpse he stalked this way and that,"
2239,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"His spear and buckler round about him held,"
2240,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,To all who dared approach him threat’ning death.”
2241,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2242,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Diomed in this case avails himself of a mode of attack not uncommon with
2243,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Homer’s heroes. He seizes a huge stone--which not two men of this
2244,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"degenerate age (says Homer, with a poet’s cynicism for the present)"
2245,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,could have lifted--and hurls it at the Trojan prince. It strikes him on
2246,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the hip, crushes the joint, and brings him to his knees. But that his"
2247,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"goddess-mother Venus comes to his rescue, the world had heard the last"
2248,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"of Æneas, and Virgil must have sought another hero for his great poem."
2249,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2250,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“About her much-loved son her arms she throws--
2251,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Her arms, whose whiteness match the falling snows;"
2252,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Screened from the foe behind her shining veil,"
2253,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The swords wave harmless and the javelins fail.” (P.)
2254,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2255,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Sthenelus, for his part, remembers the orders of his friend and chief,"
2256,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,and drives off at once to the Greek camp with the much-coveted horses of
2257,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Æneas. Diomed rushes in pursuit of Venus--whom he knows, by his new gift"
2258,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,of clear vision--as she carries off her son through the ranks of the
2259,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Trojans. She, at least, of all the divinities of Olympus, had no"
2260,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"business, thought the Greek, in the _mêlée_ of battle. Besides, he had"
2261,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,received from Minerva special permission to attack her. Most
2262,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"ungallantly, to our notions, he does so. The scene is such a curious"
2263,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"one, that it is well to give Lord Derby’s version of it:--"
2264,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2265,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Her, searching through the crowd, at length he found,"
2266,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And springing forward, with his pointed spear"
2267,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,A wound inflicted on her tender hand.
2268,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Piercing th’ ambrosial veil, the Graces’ work,"
2269,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The sharp spear grazed her palm below the wrist.
2270,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Forth from the wound th’ immortal current flowed,"
2271,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Pure ichor, life-stream of the blessed Gods;"
2272,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"They eat no bread, they drink no ruddy wine,"
2273,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,And bloodless thence and deathless they become.
2274,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The goddess shrieked aloud, and dropped her son;"
2275,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,But in his arms Apollo bore him off
2276,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"In a thick cloud enveloped, lest some Greek"
2277,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Might pierce his breast, and rob him of his life."
2278,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Loud shouted brave Tydides, as she fled:"
2279,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"‘Daughter of Jove, from battle-fields retire;"
2280,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Enough for thee weak women to delude;
2281,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"If war thou seek’st, the lesson thou shalt learn"
2282,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Shall cause thee shudder but to hear it named.’
2283,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Thus he; but ill at ease, and sorely pained,"
2284,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The Goddess fled: her, Iris, swift as wind,"
2285,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Caught up, and from the tumult bore away,"
2286,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Weeping with pain, her fair skin soiled with blood.”"
2287,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2288,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"It is the original of the grand passage in the ‘Paradise Lost,’ in which"
2289,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the English poet has adopted almost literally the Homeric idea of
2290,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"suffering inflicted on an immortal essence, while carefully avoiding the"
2291,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"ludicrous element in the scene. In the battle of the Angels, Michael"
2292,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,cleaves Satan down the right side:--
2293,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2294,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“The griding sword with discontinuous wound
2295,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Passed through him; but th’ ethereal substance closed,"
2296,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Not long divisible; and from the gash
2297,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"A stream of nectar’ous humour issuing flowed,"
2298,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Sanguine, such as celestial spirits may bleed.”"
2299,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"--Par. Lost, vi. 329."
2300,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2301,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"In sore plight the goddess mounts to Olympus, and there, throwing"
2302,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"herself into the arms of her mother Dione, bewails the wrong she has"
2303,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,suffered at the hands of a presumptuous mortal. Dione comforts her as
2304,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"best she may, reminding her how in times past other of the Olympian"
2305,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"deities have had to endure woes from men: Mars, when the giants Otus and"
2306,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Ephialtes bound him for thirteen months in brazen fetters; Juno herself,"
2307,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the queen of Heaven, and Pluto, the king of the Shades, had been wounded"
2308,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"by the daring Hercules. She foretells, however, an untimely death for"
2309,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the presumptuous hero who has raised his hand against a goddess:--
2310,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2311,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Fool and blind!
2312,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Unknowing he how short his term of life,"
2313,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Who fights against the gods! for him no child
2314,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Upon his knees shall lisp a father’s name,"
2315,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Safe from the war and battle-field returned.
2316,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Brave as he is, let Diomed beware"
2317,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,He meet not with a mightier than himself:
2318,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Then fair Ægiale, Adrastus’ child,"
2319,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The noble wife of valiant Diomed,"
2320,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Shall long, with lamentations loud, disturb"
2321,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The slumbers of her house, and vainly mourn"
2322,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Her youthful lord, the bravest of the Greeks.” (D.)"
2323,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2324,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,But Dione is no prophet. Diomed returned home (if the later legends are
2325,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,to be believed) to find that his wife Ægiale had been anything but
2326,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,inconsolable during his absence.
2327,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2328,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Venus’ wound is healed, and her tears are soon dried. But Minerva--whose"
2329,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,province in the celestial government seems to be not only wisdom but
2330,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,satire--cannot resist a jest upon the unfortunate plight of the Queen of
2331,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Love. She points her out to Jupiter, and suggests as a probable"
2332,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"explanation of the wound, that she has been trying to lead astray some"
2333,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"other fair Greek, like Helen,--"
2334,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2335,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“And as her hand the gentle dame caressed,"
2336,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,A golden clasp has scratched her slender arm.”
2337,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2338,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Jupiter smiles, and calling his pouting daughter-goddess to his side,"
2339,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,recommends her in future to leave to Mars and Minerva the dangers of the
2340,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"battle-field, and confine her own prowess to campaigns in which she is"
2341,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,likely to be more victorious.
2342,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2343,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Diomed is still rushing in pursuit of Æneas. He knows that Apollo is
2344,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,shielding him; but not even this knowledge checks the impetuous Greek.
2345,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2346,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Thrice was his onset made, with murd’rous aim,"
2347,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,And thrice Apollo struck his glittering shield;
2348,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,But when with godlike force he sought to make
2349,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"His fourth attempt, the Far-destroyer spake"
2350,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"In terms of awful menace; ‘Be advised,"
2351,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Tydides, and retire; nor as a god"
2352,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Thyself esteem, since not alike the race"
2353,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Of gods immortal and of earth-born men.’” (D.)
2354,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2355,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Diomed accepts the warning, and Æneas is carried off to the temple of"
2356,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Apollo in the citadel, where Latona and Diana tend and heal him. Apollo"
2357,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"meanwhile replaces him in the battle by a phantom likeness, round which"
2358,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Greeks and Trojans continue the fight. Then he calls his brother deity
2359,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the War-god to the rescue of the hard-prest Trojans, and entreats him to"
2360,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"scare from the field this irreverent and outrageous champion, who, he"
2361,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"verily believes, would lift his spear against Olympian Jove himself. In"
2362,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the likeness of a Thracian chief, Mars calls Hector to the rescue; and"
2363,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the Trojan prince leaps from his chariot, and, crying his battle-cry,"
2364,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"turns the tide of war. Æneas is restored, sound and well, to his place"
2365,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"in the _mêlée_--somewhat indeed to the astonishment of his friends, who"
2366,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"had seen him lying so long grievously wounded; but, as the poet pithily"
2367,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"remarks, little time had they to ask him questions. The two Ajaxes,"
2368,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Ulysses, Menelaus, and Agamemnon himself, “king of men,” come to the"
2369,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"forefront of the Greek battle: and the young Antilochus, son of the"
2370,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"venerable Nestor, notably wins his spurs. But the Trojans have"
2371,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"supernatural aid: and Diomed, of the purged vision, cries to his friends"
2372,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"to beware, for that he sees the War-god in their front brandishing his"
2373,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,huge spear. The Greek line warily gives ground before this immortal
2374,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,adversary. The Queen of Heaven can no longer endure to be a mere
2375,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,spectatress of the peril of her favourites. She obtains permission from
2376,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Jupiter to send Minerva against Mars: and the two goddesses, seated in"
2377,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Juno’s chariot of state, glide down from Olympus--"
2378,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2379,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“Midway between the earth and starry heaven”--
2380,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2381,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"and alight upon the plain of Troy. There Juno, taking human shape,"
2382,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,taunts the Greek troops with cowardice--
2383,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2384,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“In form of Stentor of the brazen voice,"
2385,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Whose shout was as the shout of fifty men”--
2386,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2387,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,and whose name has made a familiar place for itself in our English
2388,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,vocabulary.
2389,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2390,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Shame on ye, Greeks, base cowards! brave alone"
2391,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,In outward semblance: while Achilles yet
2392,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Went forth to battle, from the Dardan gates"
2393,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The Trojans never ventured to advance.”
2394,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2395,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Minerva seeks out Diomed, whom she finds leaning on his chariot, resting"
2396,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"awhile from the fight, and bathing the wound made by the arrow of"
2397,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Pandarus. She taunts him with his inferiority to his great father
2398,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Tydeus, who was, she reminds him, “small in stature, but every inch a"
2399,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,soldier.” Diomed excuses himself by reference to her own charge to
2400,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,him--to fight with none of the immortals save Venus only. But now the
2401,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"goddess withdraws the prohibition, and herself--putting on the “helmet"
2402,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"of darkness,” to hide herself from Mars--takes her place beside him in"
2403,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the chariot, instead of Sthenelus, his henchman and charioteer: and the"
2404,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,chariot-axle groans beneath the more than mortal load. They drive in
2405,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,full career against the War-god: in vain he hurls his spear against
2406,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Diomed, for the hand of the goddess turns it safely aside. The mortal"
2407,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"champion is more successful: his spear strikes Mars in the flank,"
2408,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"piercing the flesh, and drawing from him, as from Venus, the heavenly"
2409,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“ichor.” And the wounded god cries out with a shout like that of ten
2410,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"thousand men, so that both hosts listen to the sound with awe and"
2411,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"trembling. He too, like Venus, flies to Olympus, and there makes piteous"
2412,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"complaint of the impious deeds which, at the instigation of Minerva,"
2413,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,this headstrong mortal is permitted to do. His father Jupiter rates him
2414,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"soundly, as the outlaw of the Olympian family, inheriting his mother"
2415,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Juno’s headstrong temper. However, he bids Pæon, the physician of the"
2416,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"immortals, heal the wound, and Hebe prepares him a bath. Juno and"
2417,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Minerva have done their work, having driven Mars from the field, and"
2418,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"they too quit the plains of Troy, and leave the mortal heroes to"
2419,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,themselves.
2420,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2421,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"While Diomed still pursues his career of slaughter, Menelaus gives token"
2422,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,of that easy and pliant disposition which half explains his behaviour to
2423,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Helen. He has at his mercy a Trojan who has been thrown from his
2424,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"chariot, and begs his life. The fair-haired king is about to spare"
2425,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"him,--as none in the whole story of the fight is spared,--when his"
2426,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"brother Agamemnon comes up, and after chiding him for such"
2427,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"soft-heartedness, pins the wretched suppliant to the ground with his"
2428,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,ashen spear.
2429,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2430,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"So the fight goes on through the sixth book; which is, however, chiefly"
2431,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,remarkable for two of the most striking episodes in the poem. The first
2432,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"is the meeting of Diomed with the young Lycian captain, Glaucus."
2433,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Encountering him in the field, and struck by his bold bearing, he asks"
2434,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"his name and race. Glaucus replies with that pathetic simile which,"
2435,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"found under many forms in many poets, has its earliest embodiment in the"
2436,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,verse of the Hebrew Psalmist and the Greek bard. “The days of man are
2437,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,but as grass.”
2438,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2439,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Brave son of Tydeus, wherefore set thy mind"
2440,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,My race to know? the generations are
2441,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"As of the leaves, so also of mankind."
2442,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"As the leaves fall, now withering in the wind,"
2443,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And others are put forth, and spring descends,"
2444,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Such on the earth the race of men we find;
2445,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Each in his order a set time attends;
2446,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,One generation rises and another ends.” (W.)
2447,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2448,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The young chieftain goes on, nevertheless, to announce his birth and"
2449,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,lineage. He is the grandson of the noble Bellerophon--the rider of the
2450,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,wondrous horse Pegasus and the slayer of the monster Chimæra--all of
2451,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"whose exploits he narrates at length, with some disregard to"
2452,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"probabilities, in the full roar of the battle round him. It turns out"
2453,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,that he and Diomed are bound together by a tie which all of Greek blood
2454,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,scrupulously respected--the rights of hospitality exercised towards each
2455,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,other by some of their ancestors. Such obligations descended from father
2456,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"to son, and served from time to time to mitigate the fierce and"
2457,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,vindictive spirit of an age when every man’s hand was in some sort
2458,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,against another. The grandfather of Diomed had been Bellerophon’s guest
2459,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"and friend. So the Greek places his spear in the ground, and vows that"
2460,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,he will not raise his arm against Glaucus. There are enough besides of
2461,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the Trojan allies for him to slay, and Glaucus may find Greeks enough on"
2462,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"whom to flesh his valour; but for themselves, the old hereditary bond"
2463,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"shall hold good, and in token of amity they will change armour. A good"
2464,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"exchange, indeed, for Diomed; for whereas his own is but of the ordinary"
2465,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"brass or bronze, the young Lycian’s panoply is richly inlaid with"
2466,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,gold--“a hundred oxen’s worth for the worth of nine.” The Greek words
2467,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,have passed into a proverb.
2468,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2469,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The Trojans are still hard prest, and by the advice of his brother"
2470,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Helenus, who has the gift of soothsaying, and is as it were the domestic"
2471,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"priest of the royal household, Hector hastens to the city, and directs"
2472,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,his mother Hecuba to go with her matrons in solemn procession to the
2473,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"temple of Pallas, and beseech the goddess to withdraw the terrible"
2474,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Diomed from the field. In the palace, to his indignation, he finds"
2475,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Paris dallying with Helen, and polishing his armour instead of joining"
2476,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the fight. Hector upbraids him sharply: and Helen, in a speech full of"
2477,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"self-abasement, laments the unworthiness of her paramour. Hector speaks"
2478,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"no word of reproach to her, though he gently declines her invitation to"
2479,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,rest himself also a while from the battle. Paris promises to follow him
2480,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"at once to the field; and Hector moves on to his own wife’s apartments,"
2481,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,to see her and his child once more before he goes back to the combat
2482,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"which he has a half-foreboding will end fatally for himself, whatever be"
2483,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the fortunes of Troy.
2484,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2485,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And now we are introduced to the second female character in the poem,"
2486,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"standing in the strongest possible contrast with that of Helen, but of"
2487,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,no less admirable conception. It is remarkable how entirely Homer
2488,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"succeeds in interesting us in his women, without having recourse to what"
2489,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,might seem to us the very natural expedient of dwelling on their
2490,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"personal charms; especially when it is taken into account that, in his"
2491,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"simple narrative, he has not the resources of the modern novelist, who"
2492,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,can make even the plainest heroine attractive by painting her mental
2493,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"perfections, or setting before us the charms of her conversation. It has"
2494,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,been said that he rather assumes than describes the beauty of Helen: in
2495,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"the case of Andromache, it has been remarked that he never once applies"
2496,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"to her any epithet implying personal attractions, though all his"
2497,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"translators, Lord Derby included, have been tempted to do so. It is as"
2498,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the wife and mother that Andromache charms us. We readily assume that
2499,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"she is comely, graceful--all that a woman should be; but it is simple"
2500,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,grace of domestic character which forms the attraction of the Trojan
2501,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,princess.
2502,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2503,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Hector does not find her, as he expects, in the palace. She had heard"
2504,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,how the fortunes of the day seemed turning against the Trojans; and she
2505,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"had hurried, “like one distraught,” to the tower of the citadel, to see"
2506,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,with her own eyes how the fight was going. He meets her at the Scæan
2507,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"gates, with the nurse and the child, “whom Hector called Scamandrius,"
2508,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"from the river, but the citizens Astyanax”--“defender of the city.” The"
2509,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"father looks silently on his boy, and smiles; Andromache in tears clings"
2510,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"to her husband, and makes a pathetic appeal to him not to be too"
2511,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,prodigal of a life which is so dear to his wife and child. Her fate has
2512,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,been already that of many women of her day. Her father and seven tall
2513,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"brethren have been slain by the fierce Achilles, when ravaging the"
2514,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,country round Troy he destroyed their native city of Cilician Thebes:
2515,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"her mother too is dead, and she is left alone. She adds the touching"
2516,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"loving confession, which Pope’s version has made popular enough even to"
2517,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,unclassical ears--
2518,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2519,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“But while my Hector still survives, I see"
2520,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"My father, mother, brethren, all in thee.”"
2521,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2522,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Hector soothes her, but it is with a mournful foreboding of evil to"
2523,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,come. He values too much his own honour and fair fame to shrink from the
2524,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,battle:--
2525,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2526,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,“I should blush
2527,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"To face the men and long-robed dames of Troy,"
2528,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,If like a coward I could shun the fight;
2529,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Nor could my soul the lessons of my youth
2530,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"So far forget, whose boast it still has been"
2531,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"In the fore-front of battle to be found,"
2532,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Charged with my father’s glory and mine own.
2533,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Yet in my inmost soul too well I know
2534,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The day must come when this our sacred Troy,"
2535,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And Priam’s race, and Priam’s royal self,"
2536,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Shall in one common ruin be o’erthrown.” (D.)
2537,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2538,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,But that which wrings his heart most of all is the vision before his
2539,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,eyes of his beloved wife dragged into slavery. Pope’s version of the
2540,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"rest of the passage is so good of its kind, and has so naturalised the"
2541,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"scene to our English conceptions, that no closer version will ever"
2542,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,supersede it.
2543,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2544,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Thus having spoke, th’ illustrious chief of Troy"
2545,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy;
2546,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The babe clung crying to his nurse’s breast,"
2547,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest.
2548,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,"
2549,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And Hector hasted to relieve his child,"
2550,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The glitt’ring terrors from his brows unbound,"
2551,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.
2552,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Then kissed the child, and lifting high in air,"
2553,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Thus to the Gods preferred a father’s prayer:
2554,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"‘O thou! whose glory fills th’ ethereal throne,"
2555,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!
2556,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,"
2557,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,"
2558,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Against his country’s foes the war to wage,"
2559,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,And rise the Hector of the future age!
2560,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"So when triumphant from successful toils,"
2561,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,"
2562,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,"
2563,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,And say--This chief transcends his father’s fame:
2564,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,"
2565,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,His mother’s conscious heart o’erflows with joy.’
2566,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,"
2567,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Restored the pleasing burthen to her arms;
2568,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,"
2569,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Hushed to repose, and with a smile surveyed."
2570,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,"

2572,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The softened chief with kind compassion viewed,"

2574,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2575,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The “charms,” be it said, are entirely Pope’s idea, and do not harmonise"
2576,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,with the simplicity of the true Homeric picture. The husband was not
2577,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"thinking of his wife’s beauty. He “caresses her with his hand,” and"
2578,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,tries to cheer her with the thought that no hero dies until his work is
2579,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,done.
2580,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2581,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"“For, till my day of destiny is come,"
2582,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"No man may take my life; and when it comes,"
2583,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Nor brave nor coward can escape that day.
2584,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"But go thou home, and ply thy household cares,"
2585,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"The loom and distaff, and appoint thy maids"
2586,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Their several tasks; and leave to men of Troy,"
2587,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And chief of all to me, the toils of war.” (D.)"
2588,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,
2589,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,The tender yet half-contemptuous tone in which the iron soldier
2590,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"relegates the woman to her own inferior cares, is true to the spirit of"
2591,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,every age in which war is the main business of man’s life. Something in
2592,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,the same tone is the charming scene between Hotspur and his lady in
2593,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Shakspeare’s ‘Henry IV.’

2598,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"We must have bloody noses and crack’t crowns,"
2599,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"And pass them current too.--God’s me, my horse!--"

2612,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,"
2613,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate."
2614,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"I know you wise; but yet, no further wise"
2615,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Than Harry Percy’s wife: constant you are--
2616,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"But yet a woman: and for secrecy,"
2617,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,No lady closer: for I well believe
2618,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Thou wilt not utter that thou dost not know.”

2621,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"girt for the battle in glittering armour, the show knight of the"
2622,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"Trojans: Andromache back to the palace, casting many a lingering glance"
2623,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,behind at the gallant husband she is fated never again to see alive. The
2624,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,Roman ladies of the last days of the Republic were not much given to
2625,THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.,"sentiment; but we do not wonder that Brutus’s wife, Portia, knowing well"

2635,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2636,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2637,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"By the advice of his brother Helenus, who knows the counsels of heaven,"
2638,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,Hector now challenges the Greek host to match some one of their
2639,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,chieftains against him in single combat. There is an unwillingness even
2640,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,amongst the bravest to accept the defiance--so terrible is the name of
2641,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,Hector. Menelaus--always gallant and generous--is indignant at their
2642,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"cowardice, and offers himself as the champion. He feels he is no match"
2643,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"for Hector; but, as he says with modest confidence, the issues in such"
2644,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"case lie in the hands of heaven. But Agamemnon, ever affectionately"
2645,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"careful of his brother, will not suffer such unequal risk: some more"
2646,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,stalwart warrior shall be found to maintain the honour of the Achæans.
2647,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Old Nestor rises, and loudly regrets that he has no longer the eye and"
2648,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"sinews of his youth--but the men of Greece, he sees with shame, are not"
2649,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"now what they were in his day. Stung by the taunt, nine chiefs spring to"
2650,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"their feet at once, and offer themselves for the combat. Conspicuous"
2651,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"amongst them are Diomed, the giant Ajax, and King Agamemnon himself; and"
2652,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"when the choice of a champion is referred to lot, the hopes and wishes"
2653,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"of the whole army are audibly expressed, that on one of these three the"
2654,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,lot may fall. It falls on Ajax; and amidst the congratulations and
2655,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"prayers of his comrades, the tall chieftain dons his armour, and strides"
2656,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,forth to meet his adversary. The combat is maintained with vigour on
2657,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"both sides, till dusk comes on; the heralds interpose, and they separate"
2658,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,with mutual courtesies and exchange of presents.
2659,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2660,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Both armies agree to a truce, that they may collect and burn their dead"
2661,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"who strew the plain thickly after the long day’s battle. The Trojans,"
2662,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"dispirited by their loss, and conscious that, owing to the breach of the"
2663,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"first truce by the treacherous act of Pandarus, they are fighting under"
2664,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"the curse of perjury, hold a council of war, in which Antenor (the"
2665,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Nestor of Troy) proposes to restore Helen and her wealth, and so put an"
2666,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,end at last to this weary siege. But Paris refuses--he will give back
2667,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"the treasure, but not Helen; and the proposal thus made is spurned by"
2668,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,the Greeks as an insult. They busy themselves in building a
2669,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"fortification--ditch, and wall, and palisade--to protect their fleet"
2670,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,from any sudden incursion of the Trojans. When this great work is
2671,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"completed, they devote the next night to one of those heavy feasts and"
2672,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"deep carousals, to which men of the heroic mould have always had the"
2673,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,repute of being addicted in the intervals of hard fighting. Most
2674,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"opportunely, a fleet of merchant-ships comes in from Lemnos, laden with"
2675,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"wine; in part a present sent by Euneus, son of the renowned voyager"
2676,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Jason, to the two royal brothers; in part a trading speculation, which"
2677,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,meets with immediate success among the thirsty host. The thunder of
2678,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Olympus rolls all through the night, for the Thunderer is angry at the"
2679,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,prolongation of the war: but the Greeks content their consciences with
2680,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"pouring copious libations to appease his wrath, and after their"
2681,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,prolonged revelry sink into careless slumber.
2682,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2683,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"At daybreak Jupiter holds a council in Olympus, and harangues the"
2684,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,assembled deities at some length--with a special request that he may not
2685,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"be interrupted. He forbids, on pain of his royal displeasure, any"
2686,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,further interference on the part of the Olympians on either side in the
2687,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"contest; and then, mounting his chariot, descends in person to Mount Ida"
2688,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"to survey the field of battle, once more crowded with fierce combatants."
2689,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"He hesitates, apparently, which side he shall aid--for he has no"
2690,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,intention of observing for himself the neutrality which he has so
2691,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,strictly enjoined upon others. So he weighs in a balance the fates of
2692,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Greek and Trojan: the former draws down the scale, while the destiny of"
2693,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Troy mounts to heaven. The metaphor is reversed, according to our modern"
2694,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,notions; it is the losing side which should be found wanting when
2695,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,weighed in the balance. And so Milton has it in the passage which is
2696,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"undoubtedly founded on these lines of Homer. “The Omnipotent,” says"
2697,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Milton,"
2698,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2699,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"“Hung forth in heaven His golden scales, yet seen"
2700,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Betwixt Astræa and the Scorpion sign,"
2701,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Wherein all things created first He weighed,"
2702,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,The pendulous round earth with balanced air
2703,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"In counterpoise; now ponders all events,"
2704,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Battles and realms; in these He put two weights,"
2705,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,The sequel each of parting and of fight:
2706,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,The latter quick up flew and kicked the beam.”
2707,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2708,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"And Gabriel bids Satan look up, and mark the warning:--"
2709,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2710,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"“‘For proof look up,"
2711,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"And read thy lot in yon celestial sign,"
2712,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,"
2713,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"If thou resist!’ The Fiend looked up, and knew"
2714,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"His mounted scale aloft; nor more, but fled"
2715,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.”"
2716,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"--Par. Lost, end of B. iv."
2717,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2718,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,In accordance with this decision the Thunderer sends his lightnings down
2719,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"upon the host of the Greeks, and throws them into terror and confusion."
2720,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Nestor, still in the thickest of the fray, has one of his chariot-horses"
2721,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,killed by a shaft from the bow of Paris; and while he is thus all but
2722,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"helpless, Diomed sees the terrible Hector bearing down on the old chief"
2723,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"in full career. He bids Nestor mount with him, and together they"
2724,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"encounter the Trojan prince, against whom Diomed hurls his spear: he"
2725,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"misses Hector, but kills his charioteer. As Diomed presses on, a"
2726,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,thunderbolt from Jupiter ploughs the ground right in front of his
2727,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,startled horses. Nestor sees in this omen the wrath of heaven; and at
2728,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"his entreaty Diomed reluctantly allows him to turn the horses, and"
2729,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"retires, pursued by the loud taunts of Hector, who bids the Greek"
2730,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"“wench” go hide herself. Thrice he half turns to meet his jesting enemy,"
2731,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,and thrice the roll of the angry thunder warns him not to dare the wrath
2732,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,of the god. Hector in triumph shouts to his comrades to drive the Greeks
2733,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"back to their new trenches, and burn their fleet. He calls to his horses"
2734,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"by name (he drove a bright bay and a chestnut, and called them Whitefoot"
2735,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"and Firefly), and bids them do him good suit and service now, if ever,"
2736,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"in return for all the care they have had from Andromache, who has fed"
2737,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"them day by day with her own hands, even before she would offer the"
2738,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,wine-cup to their thirsty master. The Greeks are driven back into their
2739,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"trenches, where they are rallied by the royal brothers Agamemnon and"
2740,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,Menelaus in person. They have too on their side a bowman as good as
2741,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Pandarus or Paris, who now does them gallant service. It is Teucer, the"
2742,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,younger brother of the huge Ajax. The description of his manner of fight
2743,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,would suit almost exactly the light archer and his pavoise-bearer of the
2744,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,medieval battle:--
2745,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2746,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,“Ajax the shield extended: Teucer then
2747,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Peered from behind, and with a shaft forth stept,"
2748,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,And slew one singled from the enemy’s men:
2749,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Then, as a child creeps to his mother, crept"
2750,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"To Ajax, who the shield before him swept.” (W.)"
2751,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2752,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Eight times he draws his bow, and every arrow reaches its mark in a"
2753,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Trojan. Twice he shoots at Hector, but each time the shaft is turned"
2754,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"aside, and finds some less renowned victim. Of these the last is"
2755,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,Hector’s charioteer--the second who in this day’s battle has paid the
2756,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"forfeit of that perilous honour. Hector leaps down to avenge his death,"
2757,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"and Teucer, felled to the ground by a huge fragment of rock, is carried"
2758,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"off the field with a broken shoulder, still covered by the shield of"
2759,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Ajax. The Greeks remain penned within their stockade, and nothing but"
2760,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,the approach of night saves their fleet from destruction. The victorious
2761,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Trojans bivouac on the field, their watch-fires lighting up the night;"
2762,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,for Hector’s only fear now is lest his enemies should embark and set
2763,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"sail under cover of the darkness, and so escape the fate which he is"
2764,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,confident awaits them on the morrow. Mr Tennyson has chosen for
2765,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"translation the fine passage describing the scene, which closes the"
2766,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,Eighth Book:--
2767,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,
2768,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,“As when in heaven the stars about the moon
2769,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Look beautiful, when all the winds are laid,"
2770,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"And every height comes out, and jutting peak,"
2771,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"And valley, and the immeasurable heavens"
2772,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Break open to their highest, and all the stars"
2773,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Shine, and the shepherd gladdens in his heart:"
2774,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,So many a fire between the ships and stream
2775,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Of Xanthus blazed before the towers of Troy,"
2776,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,A thousand on the plain; and close by each
2777,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,Sat fifty in the blaze of burning fire;
2778,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"And, champing golden grain, the horses stood"
2779,THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.,"Hard by their chariots, waiting for the dawn.”"

2787,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2788,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2789,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The opening of the Ninth Book shows us the Greeks utterly disheartened
2790,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,inside their intrenchments. The threat of the dishonoured Achilles is
2791,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,fast being accomplished: they cannot stand before Hector. Agamemnon
2792,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"calls a hasty council, and proposes--in sad earnest, this time--that all"
2793,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,should re-embark and sail home to Greece. The proposal is received in
2794,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,silence by all except Diomed. He boldly taunts the king with cowardice:
2795,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"the other Greeks may go home if they will, but he and his good comrade"
2796,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Sthenelus will stay and fight it out, even if they fight alone. Then"
2797,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Nestor takes the privilege of his age to remind Agamemnon that his
2798,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,insult to Achilles is the real cause of their present distress. Let an
2799,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"embassy be sent to him where he lies beside his ships, in moody"
2800,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"idleness, to offer him apology and compensation for the wrong. The king"
2801,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"consents; and Ajax, Ulysses, and Phœnix are chosen to accompany the"
2802,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,royal heralds on this mission of reconciliation. Ajax--the chief who in
2803,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,all warlike points stands second only to Achilles himself in the
2804,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,estimation of the army--is a delegate to whom even the great captain of
2805,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,the Myrmidons must surely listen with respect. Phœnix has been a sort of
2806,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"foster-father to Achilles from his boyhood, intrusted with the care of"
2807,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"him by his father Peleus, and has now accompanied him to the war by the"
2808,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"old man’s special request, to aid him with advice and counsel. If any"
2809,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"one in the camp has any influence over the headstrong prince, it will be"
2810,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"the man who, as he says, has dandled him in his arms in his helpless"
2811,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,infancy. And no diplomatic enterprise could be complete without the
2812,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"addition of Ulysses, the man of many devices and of persuasive tongue."
2813,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"The chiefs set forth, and take their way along the shore to the camp of"
2814,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"the Myrmidons. They find Achilles sitting in his tent, solacing his"
2815,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"perturbed spirit with playing on the lyre, to the music of which he"
2816,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,sings the deeds of heroes done in the days of old--the exact prototype
2817,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"of those knightly troubadours of later times, who combined the"
2818,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,accomplishments of the minstrel with the prowess of the soldier. His
2819,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,faithful henchman Patroclus sits and listens to the song. With graceful
2820,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"and lofty courtesy the chief of the Myrmidons rises from his seat, and"
2821,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"lays his lyre aside, and welcomes his visitors. He will hear no message"
2822,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"until they have shared his hospitality. He brings them in, and sets them"
2823,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"down on couches spread with purple tapestry. Then, with the grand"
2824,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"patriarchal simplicity of the days of Abraham, when no office done for a"
2825,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"guest was held to be servile, he bids Patroclus fill a larger bowl, and"
2826,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"mix the wine strong, and make good preparation of the flesh of sheep,"
2827,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"and goats, and well-fed swine. The great hero himself divides the"
2828,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"carcases, while his charioteer Automedon holds them. The joints are"
2829,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,cooked above the heaped embers on ample spits under the superintendence
2830,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"of Patroclus; and when all is ready, they fall to with that wholesome"
2831,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,appetite which has been the characteristic of most heroes in classical
2832,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"and medieval times, Achilles carving for his guests, while Patroclus"
2833,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,deals out the bread. Professor Wilson’s remarks on the scene are
2834,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,characteristic:--
2835,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2836,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“In nothing was the constitution of the heroes more enviable than its
2837,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"native power--of eating at all times, and without a moment’s warning."
2838,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Never does a meal to any distinguished individual come amiss. Their
2839,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"stomachs were as heroic as their hearts, their bowels magnanimous. It"
2840,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"cannot have been forgotten by the reader, who hangs with a watering"
2841,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"mouth over the description of this entertainment, that about two hours"
2842,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"before these three heroes, Ulysses, Ajax, and old Phœnix, had made an"
2843,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,almost enormous supper in the pavilion of Agamemnon. But their walk
2844,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2845,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,‘Along the margin of the sounding deep’
2846,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2847,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,had reawakened their slumbering appetite.”
2848,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2849,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"In this respect, too, the heroes of the Carlovingian and Arthurian"
2850,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"romances equal those of Homer--probably, indeed, taking their colour"
2851,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"from his originals. Nay, a good capacity for food and drink seems in"
2852,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,itself to have been considered an heroic quality. When Sir Gareth of
2853,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Orkney sits him down at table, coming as a stranger to King Arthur’s"
2854,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"court, his performance as a trencher-man excites as much admiration as"
2855,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,his soldier-like thews and sinews. The company declare of him
2856,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"enthusiastically that “they never saw so goodly a man, nor so well of"
2857,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"his eating.” And in the same spirit Sir Kay, Arthur’s foster-brother, is"
2858,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"said, in the Welsh legend, to “have drunk like four, and fought like a"
2859,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,hundred.” The animal virtues are closely linked together; we still
2860,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,prognosticate favourably of a horse’s powers of endurance if we see
2861,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"that he is, like Sir Gareth, a good feeder. And perhaps it is some"
2862,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,lingering reminiscence of the old heroic ages that leads us still to
2863,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,mark our appreciation of modern heroes by bestowing on them a public
2864,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,dinner.
2865,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2866,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"When the meal is over, Ulysses rises, and in accordance with immemorial"
2867,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"custom--as old, it appears, as these half-mythical ages--pledges the"
2868,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,health of their illustrious host. In a speech which does full justice to
2869,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"the oratorical powers which the poet assigns him, he lays before"
2870,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Achilles the proposal of Agamemnon. He sets forth the straits to which
2871,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"the Greeks are reduced, pent within their fortifications by the terrible"
2872,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Hector, and acknowledges, in the fullest manner, that in the great name"
2873,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,of Achilles lies their only hope of rescue. He dwells upon the remorse
2874,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"which Achilles himself will surely feel, when too late, if he suffers"
2875,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,the hopes of Greece to be ruined by the indulgence of his own haughty
2876,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"spirit--the temper against which, as he reminds him, his aged father"
2877,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,warned him when first he set out for Troy:--
2878,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2879,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"“My son, the boon of strength, if so they will,"
2880,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Juno or Pallas have the power to give;
2881,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"But thou thyself thy haughty spirit must curb,"
2882,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,For better far is gentle courtesy.”
2883,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2884,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,He lays before him the propositions of Agamemnon. Briseis shall be
2885,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"restored to him, in all honour, pure as when she left him; so the great"
2886,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"point in the quarrel is fully conceded. Moreover, the king will give him"
2887,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"the choice of his three daughters in marriage, if it ever be their happy"
2888,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"fate to see again the shores of Argos, and will add such dowry"
2889,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2890,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“As never man before to daughter gave.”
2891,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2892,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"And he will send, for the present, peace-offerings of royal"
2893,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"magnificence; ten talents of pure gold, seven fair Lesbian slaves, “well"
2894,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"skilled in household cares,” twelve horses of surpassing fleetness--the"
2895,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,prizes they have already won would be in themselves a fortune--and seven
2896,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"prosperous towns on the sea-coast of Argos. He adds, in well-conceived"
2897,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"climax to his speech, an appeal to higher motives. If Achilles will not"
2898,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"relax his wrath against Agamemnon, at least let him have some compassion"
2899,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,on the unoffending Greeks; let him bethink himself of the national
2900,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"honour--of his own great name; shall Hector be allowed to boast, as he"
2901,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"does now, that no Greek dares meet him in the field?"
2902,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2903,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"But neither the eloquence of Ulysses, nor the garrulous pleading of his"
2904,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"old foster-father Phœnix, who indulges himself and his company with"
2905,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"stories of Achilles’ boyhood, and of the exploits of his own younger"
2906,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"days, can bend the iron determination of the hero. He will have none of"
2907,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Agamemnon’s gifts, and none of Agamemnon’s daughters--no, not were the"
2908,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,princess as fair as Venus. Greece has store of fair maidens for him to
2909,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"choose from if he will. Nay, had either woman or wealth been his"
2910,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"delight, he had scarce come to Troy. He had counted the cost when he set"
2911,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,out for the war:--
2912,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2913,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“Successful forays may good store provide;
2914,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"And tripods may be gained, and noble steeds:"
2915,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"But when the breath of man hath passed his lips,"
2916,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Nor strength, nor foray can the loss repair."
2917,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"I by my goddess mother have been warned,"
2918,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"The silver-footed Thetis, that o’er me"
2919,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,A double chance of destiny impends:
2920,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"If here remaining, round the walls of Troy"
2921,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"I wage the war, I ne’er shall see my home,"
2922,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,But then undying glory shall be mine:
2923,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"If I return, and see my native land,"
2924,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,My glory all is gone; but length of life
2925,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Shall then be mine, and death be long deferred.” (D.)"
2926,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2927,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Besides, he adds with biting sarcasm, Agamemnon can have no need now of"
2928,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"his poor services. He has built a wall, he hears,--with ditch and"
2929,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"palisade to boot: though he doubts whether, after all, it will keep out"
2930,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Hector. To be sure, when _he_ was in the field, no wall was needed."
2931,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2932,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Nor is he a whit more moved by the few blunt and soldier-like remarks
2933,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"with which Ajax closes the conference. They may as well return, says"
2934,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"that chief to Ulysses; words are lost upon one so obstinate as Achilles,"
2935,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"who will neither listen to reason, nor cares for the love of his old"
2936,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"companions in arms. Ajax has no patience, either, with the romantic side"
2937,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,of the quarrel--
2938,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2939,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“And for a single girl! we offer seven.”
2940,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2941,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Reproach and argument are alike in vain. The hero listens patiently and
2942,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"courteously; but nothing shall move him from his resolution, unless"
2943,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Hector, the godlike, shall carry fire and sword even to the ships and"
2944,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"tents of the Myrmidons; a venture which, he thinks, the Trojan prince,"
2945,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"with all his hardihood, will pause before he makes."
2946,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2947,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,With downcast hearts the envoys return to Agamemnon; the aged Phœnix
2948,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"alone remaining behind, at Achilles’ special request, to accompany him"
2949,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,when he shall set sail for home. Great consternation falls on the
2950,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,assembled chiefs when they learn the failure of their overtures; only
2951,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Diomed, chivalrous as ever, laments that they should have stooped to ask"
2952,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,grace at such a churlish hand. Let Achilles go or stay as he will: for
2953,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,themselves--let every man refresh himself with food and wine--“for
2954,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,therein do lie both strength and courage”--and then betake themselves to
2955,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"their no less needful rest: ready, so soon as “the rosy-fingered dawn”"
2956,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"appears, to set the battle fearlessly in array, in front of their ships"
2957,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"and tents, against this redoubtable Hector."
2958,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2959,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,But
2960,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2961,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.”
2962,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2963,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"There is no rest for the King of Men, who has the fate of a national"
2964,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"armament on his soul. He looks forth upon the plain, where the thousand"
2965,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"watchfires of the enemy are blazing out into the night, and hears the"
2966,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"confused hum of their thick-lying battalions, and the sounds of the wild"
2967,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Eastern music with which they are enlivening their revels, and"
2968,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,celebrating their victory by anticipation. He rises from his troubled
2969,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"couch, determined to hold a night-council with Nestor and other chiefs"
2970,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"of mark. He is donning his armour, when he is visited by his brother"
2971,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Menelaus--for he too has no rest, thinking of the dire straits into"
2972,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,which in his sole cause the armies of Greece are driven. The royal
2973,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"brothers go in different directions through the camp, and quietly rouse"
2974,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,all the most illustrious captains. Nestor is the guiding spirit in the
2975,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"council, as before. He advises a reconnoissance of the enemy’s lines"
2976,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"under cover of the darkness. The office of a spy, be it remembered, was"
2977,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"reckoned in these old times, as in the days of the Hebrew commonwealth,"
2978,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,a service of honour as well as of danger; and the kings and chiefs of
2979,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,the Greeks no more thought it beneath their dignity than Gideon did in
2980,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,the case of the Midianites. The man who could discover for them the
2981,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"counsels of Hector would win for himself not only a solid reward, but an"
2982,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,immortal name--
2983,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2984,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“High as heaven in all men’s mouths
2985,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Should be his praise, and ample his reward;"
2986,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,For every captain of a ship should give
2987,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"A coal-black ewe, and at her foot a lamb,"
2988,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,A prize beyond compare: and high should be
2989,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,His place at banquets and at solemn feasts.”
2990,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2991,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Diomed straightway volunteers for the adventure, and out of the many"
2992,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"chiefs who offer themselves as his comrade, he chooses Ulysses. So--not"
2993,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,without due prayer to Heaven--valour and subtlety go forth together on
2994,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,their perilous errand.
2995,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
2996,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Meanwhile the same idea has occurred to Hector; he too would learn the
2997,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,counsels of his enemies. One Dolon--a young warrior who has a fine taste
2998,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"for horses, but is otherwise of somewhat feminine type (Homer tells us"
2999,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"he was the only brother of five sisters), and whose main qualification"
3000,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,is fleetness of foot--is tempted to undertake the enterprise on a
3001,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,somewhat singular condition--that he shall have as his prize the more
3002,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"than mortal horses of Achilles, when, as he doubts not will be soon the"
3003,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"case, the spoils of the conquered Greeks shall come to be divided. And"
3004,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Hector, with equal confidence, swears “by his sceptre” that they shall"
3005,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"be his and none other’s. Wrapped in a cloak of wolfskin, and wearing a"
3006,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"cap of marten’s fur instead of a helmet, he too steals out into the"
3007,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,night. He does not escape the keen vision of Ulysses. The Greek spies
3008,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"crouch behind some dead bodies, and allow him to pass them, when they"
3009,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,rise and cut off his retreat to the Trojan camp. At first he thinks they
3010,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"are Trojans, sent after him by Hector;"
3011,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3012,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"“But when they came a spear-cast off, or less,"
3013,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"He knew them for his foes, and slipt away"
3014,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,With lithe knees flying: and they behind him press.
3015,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,As when with jaggèd teeth two dogs of prey
3016,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Hang steadily behind, to seize and slay,"
3017,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Down the green woods, a wild fawn or a hare,"
3018,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,That shrieking flies them; on his track so lay
3019,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Odysseus and the son of Tydeus there,"
3020,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Winding him out from Troy, and never swerved a hair.” (W.)"
3021,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3022,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Their aim is to take him alive. Diomed at last gets within an easy
3023,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,spear-cast--
3024,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3025,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"“Then, hurling, he so ruled his aim, the spear"
3026,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Whizzed by the neck, then sank into the ground."
3027,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"He, trembling in his teeth, and white with fear,"
3028,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Stood: from his mouth there came a chattering sound.
3029,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"They panting, as he wept, his arms enwound."
3030,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"‘Take me alive, and sell me home,’ cried he;"
3031,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"‘Brass, iron, and fine gold are with me found."
3032,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Glad will my father render countless fee,"
3033,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,If living by the ships they bear him news of me.’” (W.)
3034,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3035,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Ulysses parleys with the unhappy youth, and drags from his terrified"
3036,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"lips not only the secret of his errand, but the disposition of the"
3037,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Trojan forces,--most convenient information for their own movements."
3038,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Especially, he tells them where they might find an easy prey, such as"
3039,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"his own soul would love. Rhesus, king of the Thracian allies, has his"
3040,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,camp apart--
3041,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3042,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"“No steeds that e’er I saw,"
3043,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"For size and beauty, can with his compare;"
3044,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Whiter than snow, and swifter than the wind.”"
3045,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3046,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The unwilling treachery does not save his wretched life. Ulysses
3047,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,sarcastically admires his choice of a reward--
3048,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3049,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"“High soared thy hopes indeed, that thought to win"
3050,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The horses of Achilles; hard are they
3051,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"For mortal man to harness or control,"
3052,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Save for Achilles’ self, the goddess-born.”"
3053,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3054,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Then--with the cruel indifference to human life which marks every one of
3055,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Homer’s heroes--he severs his head from his body.
3056,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
3057,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Following the directions given by Dolon, the two Greeks make their way"
3058,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,first to the quarters of the Thracian contingent. Swiftly and silently
3059,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Diomed despatches the king and twelve of his warriors, as they sleep,"
3060,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,while Ulysses drives off the snow-white horses. With these trophies they
3061,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"return safe to the Greek camp, where they are cordially welcomed, though"
3062,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,it must be admitted they have gained but little insight into the designs
3063,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,of Hector.[19]

3071,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3072,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3073,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"With the morrow’s dawn begins the third and great battle, at the Greek"
3074,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"lines, which occupies from the eleventh to the eighteenth book of the"
3075,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"poem. Agamemnon is the hero of the earlier part of the day, and Hector"
3076,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"is warned by Jupiter not to hazard his own person in the battle, unless"
3077,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"the Greek king is wounded; which at last he is, by the spear of a son of"
3078,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Antenor. Ulysses and Diomed supply his place; until Paris, fighting in"
3079,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"somewhat coward fashion, crouching behind the monumental stone of the"
3080,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"national hero Ilus, pins Diomed through the right heel to the ground"
3081,THE THIRD BATTLE.,with an arrow. Ulysses stands manfully at bay almost alone amidst a host
3082,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"of enemies, holding his ground, though he too is wounded, till Ajax"
3083,THE THIRD BATTLE.,comes to his aid. Still the Greeks have the worst of it. The skilful
3084,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"leech Machaon, amongst others, is wounded by an arrow from the bow of"
3085,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Paris: till even Achilles, watching the fight from the lofty prow of his"
3086,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"ship, sees his day of triumph and vengeance close at hand. He sends"
3087,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Patroclus to the field--nominally to inquire who has just been carried
3088,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"off wounded, but with the further object, we may suppose, of learning"
3089,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"the state of the case more thoroughly. Nestor, to whose tent Patroclus"
3090,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"comes, begs him to use his influence now with his angry chief, and"
3091,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"persuade him, if not to come to the rescue in person, at least to send"
3092,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"his stout Myrmidons to the aid of his countrymen, under Patroclus’ own"
3093,THE THIRD BATTLE.,command.
3094,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3095,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Again the Greeks are driven within their intrenchments, and Hector and"
3096,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"the Trojan chariot-fighters pressing on them, attempt in their fierce"
3097,THE THIRD BATTLE.,excitement even to make their horses leap the ditch and palisade. Foiled
3098,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"in this, they dismount, and, forming in five detachments under the"
3099,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"several command of Hector, Helenus, Paris, Æneas, and Asius son of"
3100,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Hyrtacus, they attack the stockade at five points at once. Asius alone"
3101,THE THIRD BATTLE.,refuses to quit his chariot; and choosing the quarter where a gate is
3102,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"still left open to receive the Greek fugitives, he drives full at the"
3103,THE THIRD BATTLE.,narrow entrance. But in that gateway on either hand stand two stalwart
3104,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"warders, Leonteus and Polypates. The latter is the son of the mighty"
3105,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"hero Pirithous, friend and comrade of Hercules, and both are of the"
3106,THE THIRD BATTLE.,renowned race of the Lapithæ. Gallantly the two champions keep the
3107,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"dangerous post against all comers, while their friends from the top of"
3108,THE THIRD BATTLE.,the rampart shower huge stones upon their assailants. Even Hector at his
3109,THE THIRD BATTLE.,point of attack can make no impression: and as his followers vainly
3110,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"strive to pass the ditch, an omen from heaven strikes them with"
3111,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"apprehension as to the final issue. An eagle, carrying off a huge"
3112,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"serpent through the air, is bitten by the reptile, and drops it,"
3113,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"writhing and bleeding, in the midst of the combatants. Polydamas points"
3114,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"it out to Hector, and reads in it a warning that their victory will be"
3115,THE THIRD BATTLE.,at best a dearly-bought one. Hector rebukes him for his weakness in
3116,THE THIRD BATTLE.,putting faith in portents. The noble words in which the poet sums up
3117,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Hector’s creed in such matters have passed into a proverb with patriots
3118,THE THIRD BATTLE.,of every age and nation--
3119,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3120,THE THIRD BATTLE.,“The best of omens is our country’s cause.”
3121,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3122,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Sarpedon the Lycian, who claims none less than Jupiter for his father,"
3123,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"has taken chief command of the Trojan auxiliaries, and, gallantly"
3124,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"seconded by his countryman Glaucus, sweeps “like a black storm” on the"
3125,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"tower where Mnestheus, the Athenian, commands, and is like to have"
3126,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"carried it, when Glaucus falls wounded by an arrow from Teucer. The"
3127,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"slaughter is terrible on both sides, and the ditch and palisade are red"
3128,THE THIRD BATTLE.,with blood. “The balance of the fight hangs even;” until at last the
3129,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Trojan prince lifts a huge fragment of rock, and heaves it at the wooden"
3130,THE THIRD BATTLE.,gates which bar the entrance at his point of attack.
3131,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3132,THE THIRD BATTLE.,“This way and that the severed portals flew
3133,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Before the crashing missile; dark as night
3134,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"His low’ring brow, great Hector sprang within;"
3135,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Bright flashed the brazen armour on his breast,"
3136,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"As through the gates, two javelins in his hand,"
3137,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"He sprang; the gods except, no power might meet"
3138,THE THIRD BATTLE.,That onset; blazed his eyes with lurid fire.
3139,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Then to the Trojans, turning to the throng,"
3140,THE THIRD BATTLE.,He called aloud to scale the lofty wall;
3141,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"They heard, and straight obeyed; some scaled the wall;"
3142,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Some through the strong-built gates continuous poured;
3143,THE THIRD BATTLE.,While in confusion irretrievable
3144,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Fled to their ships the panic-stricken Greeks.” (D.)
3145,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3146,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Neptune has been watching the fight from the wooded heights of
3147,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Samothrace, and sees the imminent peril of his friends. “In four mighty"
3148,THE THIRD BATTLE.,strides”--the woods and mountains trembling beneath his feet--he reaches
3149,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"the bay of Œge, in Achaia, where far in the depths lie his shining"
3150,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"palaces of gold. There the sea-god mounts his chariot, yoking"
3151,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3152,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"“Beneath his car the brazen-footed steeds,"
3153,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Of swiftest flight, with manes of flowing gold."
3154,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"All clad in gold, the golden lash he grasped"
3155,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Of curious work, and, mounting on his car,"
3156,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Skimmed o’er the waves; from all the depths below
3157,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Gambolled around the monsters of the deep,"
3158,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Acknowledging their king; the joyous sea
3159,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Parted her waves; swift flew the bounding steeds;
3160,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Nor was the brazen axle wet with spray,"
3161,THE THIRD BATTLE.,When to the ships of Greece their lord they bore.” (D.)
3162,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3163,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"He takes the form of the soothsayer Calchas, and in his person rallies"
3164,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"the discomfited Greeks, and summons the greater and the lesser Ajax to"
3165,THE THIRD BATTLE.,the rescue. Both feel a sudden accession of new vigour and courage; Ajax
3166,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Oileus detects the divinity of their visitor, as the seeming Calchas"
3167,THE THIRD BATTLE.,turns to depart. The two chiefs quickly gather round them a phalanx of
3168,THE THIRD BATTLE.,their comrades.
3169,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3170,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"“Spear close by spear, and shield by shield o’erlaid,"
3171,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Buckler to buckler pressed, and helm to helm,"
3172,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"And man to man; the horse-hair plumes above,"
3173,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"That nodded on the warriors’ glittering crests,"
3174,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Each other touched, so closely massed they stood."
3175,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Backward by many a stalwart hand were drawn
3176,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"The spears, in act to hurl; their eyes and minds"
3177,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Turned to the front, and eager for the fray.” (D.)"
3178,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3179,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Hector’s career is stayed. Ajax the Lesser brings into play his band of
3180,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Locrian bowmen, of little use in the open field, but good when they are"
3181,THE THIRD BATTLE.,under cover.
3182,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3183,THE THIRD BATTLE.,“Theirs were not the hearts
3184,THE THIRD BATTLE.,To brook th’ endurance of the standing fight;
3185,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Nor had they brass-bound helms with horse-hair plume,"
3186,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Nor ample shields they bore, nor ashen spear,"
3187,THE THIRD BATTLE.,But came to Troy in bows and twisted slings
3188,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Of woollen cloth confiding.”
3189,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3190,THE THIRD BATTLE.,The galling storm of their arrows throws confusion into the Trojan
3191,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"ranks. Helenas and Deiphobus, Hector’s brothers, have already been led"
3192,THE THIRD BATTLE.,off wounded: Asius son of Hyrtacus has found his trust in chariot and
3193,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"horses vain, and lies dead within the Greek lines. But Hector still"
3194,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"presses on, and Paris shows that he can play the soldier on occasion as"
3195,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"successfully as the gallant. The Greeks, too, miss their leaders."
3196,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Agamemnon, Ulysses, Diomed, are all disabled for the time. The two"
3197,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Ajaxes and Idomeneus of Crete do all that man can do. But the stockade
3198,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"has been forced, and the fight is now round the ships,--the last hope of"
3199,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"bare safety for the Greek forces. If Hector burns them, as he boasts he"
3200,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"will, all means of retreat, all the long-cherished prospect of seeing"
3201,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"their homes again, are lost to them. In a hasty conference with his"
3202,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"wounded companions beside his galley, Agamemnon, suffering and"
3203,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"dispirited, once more counsels retreat before it be too late. If they"
3204,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"can but hold out till nightfall, then, under cover of the darkness, he"
3205,THE THIRD BATTLE.,proposes to take the sea. Those vessels which lie close to the shore may
3206,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"be launched at once without discovery from the enemy, and kept out at"
3207,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"anchor: the rest can follow when the Trojans have, as usual, withdrawn"
3208,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"from immediate attack, as soon as the shades of evening make the"
3209,THE THIRD BATTLE.,distinction hazardous between friend and foe. Ulysses and Diomed
3210,THE THIRD BATTLE.,overrule the proposal; and the wounded leaders return to the scene of
3211,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"combat, unable to take an active part, but inspiriting their men from"
3212,THE THIRD BATTLE.,safe posts of observation.
3213,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3214,THE THIRD BATTLE.,The interlude of comedy is furnished again by the denizens of Olympus.
3215,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Juno has watched with delight the successful efforts of Neptune to rally
3216,THE THIRD BATTLE.,the Greeks against Hector and the hateful Trojans; but she is in an
3217,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"agony of apprehension lest Jupiter, who has his attention just now"
3218,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"occupied in Thrace, should interfere at this critical moment, and still"
3219,THE THIRD BATTLE.,grant the victory to Hector. She determines to put in force all her
3220,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"powers of blandishment, and to coax the Thunderer to spend in her"
3221,THE THIRD BATTLE.,company those precious hours which are laden with the fate of her
3222,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Greeks. She is not content with her ordinary powers of fascination: she
3223,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"applies to the goddess of love for the loan of her magic girdle,--"
3224,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3225,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"“Her broidered cestus, wrought with every charm"
3226,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"To win the heart; there Love, there young Desire,"
3227,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"There fond Discourse, and there Persuasion dwelt,"
3228,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Which oft enthrals the mind of wisest men.”
3229,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3230,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"It certainly enthrals the mind of the sovereign of Olympus; who, in all"
3231,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"cases where female attractions were concerned, was even as the most"
3232,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"foolish of mortals. Transfigured by the cestus of Venus, his queen"
3233,THE THIRD BATTLE.,appears to him in a halo of celestial charms which are irresistible. In
3234,THE THIRD BATTLE.,her company he speedily forgets the wretched squabbles of the creatures
3235,THE THIRD BATTLE.,upon earth. Juno has bribed the god of sleep also to become her
3236,THE THIRD BATTLE.,accomplice; and the dread king is soon locked in profound repose.
3237,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3238,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Then Neptune seizes his opportunity, and heads the Greeks in person."
3239,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Agamemnon, disregarding his recent wound, is seen once more in the front"
3240,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"of the battle. Ajax meets Hector hand to hand, receives his spear full"
3241,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"in his breast just where his cross-belts meet, and so escapes unwounded."
3242,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"As the Trojan prince draws back to recover himself, the giant Greek"
3243,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"upheaves a huge stone that has shored up one of the galleys, and hurls"
3244,THE THIRD BATTLE.,it with main strength against his breast. “Like an oak of the forest
3245,THE THIRD BATTLE.,struck by lightning” Hector falls prone in the dust. With shouts of
3246,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"exultation, Ajax and his comrades rush to crown their victory by"
3247,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"stripping his armour; but the great chiefs of the enemy,--Æneas,"
3248,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Polydamas, the Lycian captains Sarpedon and Glaucus--gather round and"
3249,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"lock their shields in front of the fallen hero, while others bear him"
3250,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"aside out of the battle, still in a death-like swoon, to where his"
3251,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"chariot stands. Dismayed at the fall of their great leader, the Trojans"
3252,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"give ground; the trench is recrossed, and the Greeks breathe again."
3253,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3254,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Jupiter awakes from sleep just in time to see the mischief that has been
3255,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"done; the Trojans in flight, the Greeks with Neptune at their head"
3256,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"pursuing; Hector lying senseless by the side of his chariot, still"
3257,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"breathing heavily, and vomiting blood from his bruised chest, and"
3258,THE THIRD BATTLE.,surrounded by his anxious comrades. He turns wrathfully upon Juno--it is
3259,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"her work, he knows. He reminds her of former penalties which she had"
3260,THE THIRD BATTLE.,brought upon herself by deceiving him.
3261,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3262,THE THIRD BATTLE.,“Hast thou forgotten how in former times
3263,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"I hung thee from on high, and to thy feet"
3264,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Attached two ponderous anvils, and thy hands"
3265,THE THIRD BATTLE.,With golden fetters bound which none might break?
3266,THE THIRD BATTLE.,There didst thou hang amid the clouds of heaven:
3267,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Through all Olympus’ breadth the gods were wroth;
3268,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Yet dared not one approach to set thee free.” (D.)
3269,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3270,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"He does not proceed, however, to exercise any such barbarous conjugal"
3271,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"discipline on this occasion, and is readily appeased by his queen’s"
3272,THE THIRD BATTLE.,assurance that the interference of Neptune was entirely on his own
3273,THE THIRD BATTLE.,proper motion. He condescends even to explain why he desires to give a
3274,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"temporary triumph to the Trojans: it is that, in accordance with his"
3275,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"sworn promise to Thetis, he may avenge the insult offered to her son"
3276,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Achilles, by teaching the Greeks their utter helplessness without him."
3277,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3278,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"The Goddess of the Rainbow is sent to warn Neptune, on pain of the"
3279,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Thunderer’s displeasure, to quit the fight. The sea-king demurs. “Was"
3280,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"not a fair partition made, in the primeval days, between the three"
3281,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"brother-gods, of the realms of Air, and Sea, and Darkness? and is not"
3282,THE THIRD BATTLE.,Earth common ground to all? Why is not Jupiter content with his own
3283,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"lawful domains, and by what right does he assume to dictate to a"
3284,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"brother--and a brother-king?” Iris, however, calms him; he is perfectly"
3285,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"right in theory, she admits; but in practice he will find his elder"
3286,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"brother too strong for him. So the sea-god, in sulky acquiescence,"
3287,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"leaves the scene of battle, and plunges down into the depths of his own"
3288,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"dominion. Phœbus Apollo, on the other hand, receives Jupiter’s"
3289,THE THIRD BATTLE.,permission to aid the Trojans. He sweeps down from Olympus to the spot
3290,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"where Hector lies, now slowly reviving. The hero recognises his"
3291,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"celestial visitor, and feels at once his strength restored, and his"
3292,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"ardour for the battle reawakened. To the consternation of the Greeks, he"
3293,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"reappears in the field, fierce and vigorous as before. But he no longer"
3294,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"comes alone; in his front moves Phœbus Apollo,--"
3295,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3296,THE THIRD BATTLE.,“His shoulders veiled in cloud; his arm sustained
3297,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"The awful Ægis, dread to look on, hung"
3298,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"With shaggy tassels round and dazzling bright,"
3299,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Which Vulcan, skilful workman, gave to Jove,"
3300,THE THIRD BATTLE.,To scatter terror ’mid the souls of men.” (D.)
3301,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3302,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"When the sun-god flashes this in the faces of the Greeks, heart and"
3303,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"spirit fail them. Stalking in the van of the Trojans, he leads them up"
3304,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"once more against the embankment, and, planting his mighty foot upon"
3305,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"it, levels a wide space for the passage of the chariots,--"
3306,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3307,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"“Easy, as when a child upon the beach,"
3308,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"In wanton play, with hands and feet o’erthrows"
3309,THE THIRD BATTLE.,The mound of sand which late in sport he raised.”
3310,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3311,THE THIRD BATTLE.,The habits and pursuits of grown-up men change with the passing
3312,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"generation; but the children of Homer’s day might play with our own, and"
3313,THE THIRD BATTLE.,understand each other’s ways perfectly.
3314,THE THIRD BATTLE.,
3315,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Chariots and footmen press through the breach pell-mell, and again the"
3316,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"battle rages round the Greek galleys. Standing on their high decks, the"
3317,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"Greeks maintain the struggle gallantly with the long boarding-pikes, as"
3318,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"we should call them, kept on board for use in such emergencies. Ajax’"
3319,THE THIRD BATTLE.,galley is attacked by Hector in person; but the Greek chief stands
3320,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"desperately at bay, wielding a huge pike thirty-three feet long, and his"
3321,THE THIRD BATTLE.,brother Teucer plies his arrows with fatal effect upon the crowded
3322,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"assailants: until Jupiter, alarmed lest Hector should be struck, snaps"
3323,THE THIRD BATTLE.,his bowstring in sunder. Hector calls loudly for fire to burn the
3324,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"vessels, and one warrior after another, torch in hand, makes the attempt"
3325,THE THIRD BATTLE.,"at the cost of his life, until twelve lie biting the sand, slain by the"
3326,THE THIRD BATTLE.,huge weapon of Ajax.

3333,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.
3334,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3335,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3336,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Patroclus, sitting in the tent of the wounded Eurypylus, sees the"
3337,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"imminent peril of his countrymen. He cannot bear the sight, and taking"
3338,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"hasty leave of his friend, hurries back to the quarters of Achilles, and"
3339,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,stands before him in an agony of silent tears. At first the hero affects
3340,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,to chide his follower for such girlish sorrow--what cares he for the
3341,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Greeks? It is plain, however, that he does care; and when Patroclus, in"
3342,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"very outspoken terms, upbraids him for his obduracy, and asks that, even"
3343,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,if the dark doom that hangs over him makes his chief unwilling to take
3344,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"the field in person, he will at least send him with the Myrmidons to the"
3345,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"rescue, Achilles at once consents. Patroclus shall go, clad in his"
3346,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"armour, that so perchance the Trojans may be deceived, and think that"
3347,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,they see the well-known crest of Achilles himself once more leading the
3348,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,fight. Only he warns him not to advance too far; to be content with
3349,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"rescuing the galleys, and not attempt to press his victory home to the"
3350,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,walls of Troy; in that case he will find the gods of the enemy turn
3351,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"their wrath against him. In spite of his assumed indifference, Achilles"
3352,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"is intently watching the combatants in the distance, and sees the"
3353,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,flames rising in the air from the galley of Ajax. He can no longer
3354,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"restrain his feelings, but hurries his comrade forth. Patroclus puts on"
3355,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"the harness of his chief, and takes his sword and shield: only the"
3356,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,mighty spear he forbears to touch;--
3357,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3358,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"“None save Achilles’ self that spear could poise,"
3359,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"The far-famed Pelian ash, which to his sire,"
3360,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"On Pelion’s summit felled, to be the bane"
3361,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Of mightiest chiefs, the centaur Chiron gave.”"
3362,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3363,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"He mounts the hero’s chariot, driven by the noble Automedon, and drawn"
3364,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"by the three horses, Xanthus, Balius, and Pedasus--or as we should call"
3365,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"them, Chestnut, Dapple, and Swift-foot. The battalions of the Myrmidons"
3366,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"eagerly gather round their leaders,--even old Phœnix taking command of"
3367,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,one detachment. Achilles himself gives them a few fiery words of
3368,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"exhortation. “They have long chafed at their enforced idleness, and"
3369,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,clamoured for the battle; lo! there lies the opportunity they have
3370,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"longed for.” Then, standing in the midst, he pours from his most costly"
3371,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"goblet the solemn libation to Jove, and prays of him for Patroclus"
3372,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"victory and a safe return. The poet tells us, with that licence of"
3373,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,prognostication which has been considerably abused by some modern
3374,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"writers of fiction, that half the prayer was heard, and half denied."
3375,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3376,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"“Like a pack of ravening wolves, hungering for their prey,” the"
3377,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Myrmidons launch themselves against the enemy. The Trojans recognise, as"
3378,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"they believe, in the armed charioteer who heads them, the terrible"
3379,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Achilles, and consternation spreads through their ranks. Even Hector,"
3380,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"though still fighting gallantly, is borne back over the stockade, and"
3381,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,the ditch is filled with broken chariots and struggling horses. Back
3382,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"towards the Trojan lines rolls the tide of battle. Sarpedon, the great"
3383,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Lycian chief, own son to Jupiter, falls by the spear of Patroclus. The"
3384,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,ruler of Olympus has hesitated for a while whether he shall interpose to
3385,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"save him; but his fated term of life is come, and there is a mysterious"
3386,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Destiny in this Homeric mythology, against which even Jupiter seems"
3387,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,powerless. All that he can do for his offspring is to insure for his
3388,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"body the rites of burial; and by his order the twin brothers, Sleep and"
3389,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Death, carry off the corpse to his native shore of Lycia."
3390,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3391,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,But Patroclus has forgotten the parting caution of Achilles. Flushed
3392,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"with his triumph, he follows up the pursuit even to the walls of Troy."
3393,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,But there Apollo keeps guard. Thrice the Greek champion in defiance
3394,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"smites upon the battlements, and thrice the god shakes the terrible Ægis"
3395,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"in his face. A fourth time the Greek lifts his spear, when an awful"
3396,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"voice warns him that neither for him, nor yet for his mightier master"
3397,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Achilles, is it written in the fates to take Troy. Awe-struck, he draws"
3398,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"back from the wall, but only to continue his career of slaughter among"
3399,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"the Trojans. Apollo meets him in the field, strips from him his helmet"
3400,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"and his armour, and shivers his spear in his hand. The Trojan Euphorbus,"
3401,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"seeing him at this disadvantage, stabs him from behind, and Hector,"
3402,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"following him as he retreats, drives his spear through his body. As the"
3403,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Trojan prince stands over his victim, exulting after the fashion of all"
3404,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,Homeric heroes in what seems to our taste a barbarous and boastful
3405,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"spirit, Patroclus with his dying breath foretells that his slayer shall"
3406,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,speedily meet his own fate by the avenging hand of Achilles. Hector
3407,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"spurns the prophecy, and rushes after the charioteer Automedon, whom"
3408,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,the immortal horses carry off safe from his pursuit. Then donning the
3409,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"armour of Achilles, so lately worn by Patroclus, he leads on the Trojans"
3410,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"to seize the dead body, which Menelaus is gallantly defending. After a"
3411,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"long and desperate contest, the Greeks, locking their shields together"
3412,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"in close phalanx, succeed in carrying it off, the two Ajaxes keeping the"
3413,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"assailants at bay. Jupiter, in pity to the dead hero, casts a veil of"
3414,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,darkness round him. But this embarrasses the movements of friends as
3415,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"well as enemies, and gives rise to a characteristic outburst on the part"
3416,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"of Ajax, often quoted. He can fight best when he sees his way. “Give us"
3417,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"but light, O Jove, and in the light, if thou seest fit, destroy us!”"
3418,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3419,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,We have now reached the crisis of the story. The wrath of Achilles
3420,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,against Agamemnon wanes and pales before the far more bitter wrath which
3421,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"now fills his whole soul against Hector, as the slayer of his comrade."
3422,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Young Antilochus, son of Nestor, brings the mournful tidings to his"
3423,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"tent, where he sits already foreboding the result, as he sees the Greeks"
3424,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,crowding back to their galleys from the field in front of Troy. His
3425,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"grief is frantic--he tears his hair, and heaps dust upon his head, after"
3426,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,a fashion which strongly suggests the Eastern character of the tale. His
3427,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"goddess-mother, Thetis “of the silver feet,” hears him,"
3428,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3429,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"“Beside her aged father where she sat,"
3430,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"In the deep ocean-caves,”"
3431,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3432,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"and comes with all her train of sea-nymphs to console him, as when"
3433,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,before he sat weeping with indignation at the insult of Agamemnon. In
3434,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,vain she strives to comfort him with the thought that his insulted
3435,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,honour has been fully satisfied--that the Greeks have bitterly rued
3436,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"their former treatment of him. He feels only the loss of Patroclus, and"
3437,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,curses the hour in which he was born. All that he longs for now is
3438,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,vengeance upon Hector. Thetis sorrowfully reminds him that it is written
3439,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"in the book of fate that when Hector falls, his own last hour is near at"
3440,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"hand. Be it so, is his reply--death comes in turn to all men, and he"
3441,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,will meet it as he may. But he cannot go forth to battle without armour;
3442,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"and the goddess promises that by the morrow’s dawn, Vulcan, the immortal"
3443,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"craftsman, shall furnish him with harness of proof."
3444,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3445,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"The Greeks have fought their way to their vessels, step by step, with"
3446,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,the dead body of Patroclus. But Hector with his Trojans has pressed them
3447,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"close all the way, and even when at the Greek lines seizes the corpse by"
3448,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,the feet. Iris flies to Achilles with a message from Juno--will he see
3449,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,his dead friend given as a prey to the dogs and vultures?--He is without
3450,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"armour, true; but there is no need for him to adventure himself among"
3451,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"the combatants; let him only show himself, let the Trojans but hear his"
3452,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"voice, and it is enough. He does so; standing aloft upon the rampart,"
3453,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"while Pallas throws her ægis over him, and surrounds his head with a"
3454,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"halo of flashing light, he lifts his mighty voice and thrice shouts"
3455,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"aloud. Panic seizes the whole host of Troy, and while they give ground"
3456,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"in dismay, the dead Patroclus is borne off to the tent of Achilles."
3457,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3458,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Night falls on the plain, and separates the combatants. The Trojans,"
3459,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"before their evening meal, hold an anxious council, in which Polydamas,"
3460,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"as great in debate as Hector is in the field, advises that they should"
3461,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"now retire within their walls. Achilles, it is evident, will head the"
3462,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Greeks in the morning, and who shall stand before him? But the wise"
3463,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,counsel of Polydamas meets the same fate as that of Ahithophel; Heaven
3464,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,will not suffer men to listen to it. Minerva perverts the understandings
3465,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"of the Trojans, and they prefer the rasher exhortations of Hector, who"
3466,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,urges them at all hazards to keep the field.
3467,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3468,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Thetis, meanwhile, has sought out Vulcan, and bespoken his skill in the"
3469,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"forging of new armour for her son. The lame god will work for her, she"
3470,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"knows; for in the day when his cruel mother Juno, in wrath at his"
3471,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"marvellous ugliness, cast him down from Olympus, she with her"
3472,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,sister-goddess Eurynome had nursed him in their bosom till he grew
3473,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"strong. She finds him now hard at work at his forges, in the brazen"
3474,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,halls which he has made for himself in heaven. He is completing at this
3475,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,moment some marvellous machinery--twenty tripods mounted on wheels of
3476,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"gold (the earliest hint of velocipedes), which are to move of"
3477,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"themselves, and carry him to and fro to the assembly of the gods."
3478,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Another marvel, too, is to be seen in the Fire-king’s establishment,"
3479,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"which has long been the desideratum of modern households, but which"
3480,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,modern mechanical science has as yet failed to invent--automaton
3481,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"servants, worked by machinery."
3482,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3483,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"“In form as living maids, but wrought in gold,"
3484,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Instinct with consciousness, with voice endued,"
3485,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"And strength, and skill from heavenly teachers drawn;"
3486,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,These waited duteous at the monarch’s side.”
3487,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3488,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Willingly, at the request of the sea-goddess, Vulcan plies his immortal"
3489,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"art. Helmet with crest of gold, breastplate “brighter than the flash of"
3490,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"fire,” and the pliant greaves that mould themselves to the limb, are"
3491,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,soon completed. But the marvel of marvels is the shield. On this the
3492,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"god bestows all his skill, and the, poet his most graphic description."
3493,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"It is covered with figures of the most elaborate design, wrought in"
3494,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"brass, and tin, and gold, and silver. In its centre are the sun, the"
3495,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"moon, and all the host of heaven: round the rim flows the mighty"
3496,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"ocean-river, which in Homeric as in Eastern mythology encompasses the"
3497,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"earth; and on its embossed surface, crowded with figures, is embodied an"
3498,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"epitome of human life, such as life was in the days of Homer. The tale"
3499,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"is told in twelve compartments, containing each a scene of peace or war."
3500,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,Three groups represent a city in time of peace: a wedding procession
3501,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"with music and dancing, a dispute in the market-place, and a reference"
3502,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,to the judgment of the elders gathered in council. Three represent a
3503,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"city in time of war: a siege, an ambuscade, and a battle. Then follow"
3504,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"three scenes of outdoor country life: ploughing, the harvest, and the"
3505,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"vintage. The lord of the harvest stands looking on at his reapers, like"
3506,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"Boaz. In the vintage scene, the art of the immortal workman is minutely"
3507,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"described. The vines are wrought in gold, the props are of silver, the"
3508,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"grape-bunches are of a purple black, and there is a trench round of some"
3509,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"dark-hued metal, crowned by a palisade of bright tin. Three pastoral"
3510,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"groups complete the circle. First, a herd of oxen with herdsmen and"
3511,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"their dogs, attacked by lions; secondly, flocks feeding in a deep"
3512,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"valley, with the folds and shepherds’ huts in the distance; and lastly,"
3513,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"a festival dance of men and maidens in holiday attire, with the “divine"
3514,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"bard,” without whom no festival is complete, singing his lays to his"
3515,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"harp in the midst, and two gymnasts performing their feats for the"
3516,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,amusement of the crowd of lookers-on. If any reader should have imagined
3517,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,that Homer’s song of (it may be) three thousand years ago was rude and
3518,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"inartistic, he has but to read, in the version of any of our best"
3519,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"translators, this description of the Shield of Achilles, to be convinced"
3520,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,that the poet understood his work to the full as well as the immortal
3521,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,craftsman whom he represents as having wrought it. We need not trouble
3522,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"ourselves with the difficulty of that French critic, who doubted whether"
3523,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,so many subjects could really be represented on any shield of manageable
3524,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"size--like Goldsmith’s rustics who marvelled, in the case of the village"
3525,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"schoolmaster,"
3526,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3527,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,“That one small head could carry all he knew.”
3528,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,
3529,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,It is only necessary to point to the clever design of Flaxman for its
3530,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,"realisation, and its actual embodiment (with the moderate diameter of"
3531,THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.,three feet) in the shield cast by Pitts.

3541,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,With a fierce delight Achilles gazes on the work of the Olympian
3542,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"armourer, before the dazzling brightness of which even the Myrmidons"
3543,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"veil their faces. He sets forth at once for the tents of Agamemnon; and,"
3544,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"taking his way along the shore, calls the leaders to battle as he passes"
3545,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"each man’s galley. The news of his coming spreads fast and far, and"
3546,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"every man, from the highest to the lowest, even those who never quitted"
3547,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,the ship on any other occasion--
3548,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3549,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"“The steersmen who the vessels’ rudders hold,"
3550,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,The very stewards who served the daily bread”--
3551,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3552,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,flock to the central rendezvous to welcome back the champion of the
3553,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Achæans. He is as impulsive and outspoken in his reconciliation as in
3554,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,his wrath. There is no need of mediation now between himself and
3555,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Agamemnon. He accosts the king with a noble simplicity:
3556,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3557,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"“Great son of Atreus, what hath been the gain"
3558,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"To thee or me, since heart-consuming strife"
3559,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Hath fiercely raged between us, for a girl--"
3560,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Who would to heaven had died by Dian’s shafts
3561,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,That day when from Lyrnessus’ captured town
3562,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"I bore her off, so had not many a Greek"
3563,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Bitten the bloody dust, by hostile hands"
3564,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Subdued, while I in anger stood aloof."
3565,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Great was the gain to Troy; but Greece, methinks,"
3566,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Will long retain the memory of our feud.
3567,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Yet pass we that; and though our hearts be sore,"
3568,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Still let us school our angry spirits down.
3569,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,My wrath I here abjure.” (D.)
3570,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3571,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Agamemnon, for his part, magnanimously admits his error; laying the"
3572,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"chief blame, however, upon Jupiter and Fate, who blinded the eyes of his"
3573,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"understanding. The peace-offerings are produced and accepted, though"
3574,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Achilles only chafes at anything which can delay his vengeance. Ulysses
3575,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,strongly urges the necessity of a substantial meal for the whole army;
3576,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3577,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"“For none throughout the day till set of sun,"
3578,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Fasting from food, may bear the toils of war;"
3579,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"His spirit may be eager for the fray,"
3580,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Yet are his limbs by slow degrees weighed down.”
3581,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3582,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Achilles schools himself into patience while the rest act upon this
3583,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"prosaic but prudent counsel; but for himself, he will neither eat nor"
3584,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"drink, nor wash his blood-stained hands, till he has avenged the death"
3585,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"of his comrade. So he sits apart in his grief, while the rest are at the"
3586,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"banquet: Minerva, by Jupiter’s command, infusing into his body ambrosia"
3587,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"and nectar, to sustain his strength. Another true mourner is Briseis."
3588,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,The first sight which meets the captive princess on her return to the
3589,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Myrmidon camp is the bloody corpse of Patroclus. She throws herself upon
3590,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"it in an agony of tears. He, in the early days of her captivity, had"
3591,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"spoken kind and cheering words, and had been a friend in time of"
3592,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"trouble. So, too, Menelaus briefly says of him--“He knew how to be kind"
3593,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,to all men.” This glimpse which the poet gives us of the gentler
3594,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"features of the dead warrior’s character is touching enough, when we"
3595,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,remember the utter disregard of an enemy’s or a captive’s feelings shown
3596,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"not only by Homer’s heroes, but by those of the older Jewish Scriptures."
3597,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3598,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"When all is ready for the battle, Achilles dons the armour of Vulcan,"
3599,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"and draws from its case the Centaur’s gift,--the ashen spear of Mount"
3600,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Pelion, which even Patroclus, it will be remembered, had not ventured to"
3601,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"take in hand. Thus armed, he mounts his chariot, drawn by the two"
3602,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"immortal steeds, Xanthus and Balius--for their mortal yoke-fellow had"
3603,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"been slain in the battle in which Patroclus fell. As he mounts, in the"
3604,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,bitter spirit which leads him to blame the whole world for the death of
3605,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"his friend, he cannot forbear a taunt to his horses--he trusts they will"
3606,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"not leave him on the field, as they left Patroclus. Then the chestnut,"
3607,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"inspired by Juno, for once finds a human voice, and exculpates himself"
3608,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,and his comrade. It was no fault of theirs; it was the doom of
3609,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Patroclus, and Achilles’ own doom draws nigh. This day they will bring"
3610,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,him back in safety; but the end is at hand.
3611,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3612,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Unlike Hector, Achilles knows and foresees his doom clearly; but, like"
3613,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Hector, he will meet it unflinchingly. Pope’s version of his reply is"
3614,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,deservedly admired. Xanthus has uttered his warning;
3615,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3616,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"“Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,"
3617,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,His fateful voice. Th’ intrepid chief replied
3618,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,With unabated rage--‘So let it be!
3619,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Portents and prodigies are lost on me;
3620,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"I know my fate; to die, to see no more"
3621,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,My much-loved parents and my native shore;
3622,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Enough--when Heaven ordains, I sink in night;"
3623,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Now perish Troy!’ he said, and rushed to fight.”"
3624,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3625,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"In the renewed battle which ensues, the gods, by express permission of"
3626,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"their sovereign, take part. Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Mercury, and Vulcan"
3627,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"assist the Greeks: Mars, Venus, Apollo, Latona, and Diana join the"
3628,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Trojans. Their interference seems, at least to our modern taste, to"
3629,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"assist in no way the action of the poem, and merely tends to weaken for"
3630,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,the time the human interest. We must be content to assume that upon a
3631,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Greek audience the impression was different. The only effect which these
3632,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,immortal allies produce upon the fortunes of the day is a negative one;
3633,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Apollo incites Æneas to encounter Achilles, and when he is in imminent"
3634,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"danger, Neptune conveys him away in a mist. Apollo performs the same"
3635,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"office for Hector, who also engages the same terrible adversary, in the"
3636,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,hope of avenging upon him the death of his young brother Polydorus.
3637,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Disappointed in both his greater antagonists, Achilles vents his wrath"
3638,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,in indiscriminate slaughter. Driving through the disordered host of the
3639,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Trojans, his chariot wheels and axle steeped in blood, he cuts the mass"
3640,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"of fugitives in two, and drives part of them into the shallows of the"
3641,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"river Scamander. Leaping down from his chariot, he wades into the river,"
3642,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"and there continues his career of slaughter, sword in hand. Twelve"
3643,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Trojan youths he takes alive and hands them over to his followers;
3644,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,sparing them for the present only to slay them hereafter as victims at
3645,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,the funeral-pile to appease the shade of Patroclus. Another suppliant
3646,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"for his mercy has a singular history. The young Lycaon, one of the many"
3647,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"sons of Priam, had been taken prisoner by him in one of his raids upon"
3648,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Trojan territory, and sold as a slave in Lemnos. He had been ransomed"
3649,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"there and sent home to Troy, only twelve days before he fell into his"
3650,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,enemy’s hands again here in the bed of the Scamander. Achilles
3651,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"recognises him, and cruelly taunts him with his reappearance: the dead"
3652,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Trojans whom he has slain will surely next come to life again, if the"
3653,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,captives thus cross the seas to swell the ranks of his enemies. In vain
3654,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Lycaon pleads for his life, that he is not the son of the same mother as"
3655,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Hector--that his brother Polydorus has just been slain, which may well"
3656,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,content the Greek’s vengeance. There is a gloomy irony in the words with
3657,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"which Achilles rejects his prayer. Before Patroclus fell, he had spared"
3658,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"many a Trojan; but henceforth, all appeal to his mercy is vain--most of"
3659,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"all from a son of Priam. But, in fact, the wish to escape one’s fate he"
3660,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,holds to be utterly unreasonable;
3661,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3662,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"“Thou too, my friend, must die--why vainly wail?"
3663,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Dead is Patroclus too, thy better far--"
3664,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Me too thou seest, how stalwart, tall, and fair,"
3665,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Of noble sire and goddess-mother born,"
3666,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Yet must I yield to death and stubborn fate,"
3667,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Whene’er, at morn or noon or eve, the spear"
3668,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Or arrow from the bow may reach my life.” (D.)
3669,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3670,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"At last the great river-god--whom the gods call Xanthus, but men"
3671,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Scamander--rises in his might, indignant at seeing his stream choked"
3672,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"with corpses, and stained with blood. He hurls the whole force of his"
3673,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"waves against Achilles, and the hero is fain to save himself by grasping"
3674,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"an elm that overhangs the bank, and so swinging himself to land. But"
3675,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"here Scamander pursues him, and, issuing from his banks, rolls in a"
3676,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,deluge over the plain. Even the soul of Achilles is terror-stricken at
3677,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"this new aspect of death. Is he to die thus, like some vile churl--"
3678,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3679,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,“Borne down in crossing by a wintry brook?”
3680,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3681,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Neptune and Minerva appear to encourage him, and give him strength to"
3682,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,battle with the flood: and when Scamander summons his brother-river
3683,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Simois to his aid, Vulcan sends flames that scorch all the river-banks,"
3684,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"consuming the trees and shrubs that clothe them, and threatening to dry"
3685,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"up the very streams themselves. The river yields, and retires to his"
3686,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"banks, leaving Achilles free to pursue his victories. He drives the"
3687,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Trojans inside their walls, and but that Apollo guards the gates, would"
3688,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,have entered the city in hot pursuit. Hector alone remains without--his
3689,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,doom is upon him.
3690,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3691,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"The gods, meanwhile, have entered the field of battle on their own"
3692,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"account, and contributed, as before, a ludicrous element to the action"
3693,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,of the poem. Minerva fells Mars the war-god to the ground with a huge
3694,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"mass of rock, an ancient landmark, which she hurls against him; and he"
3695,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"lies covering “above seven hundred feet,” till Venus comes to his aid to"
3696,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"lead him from the field, when the terrible goddess strikes her to the"
3697,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,earth beside him. Juno shows the strength of those “white arms” which
3698,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"the poet always assigns to her, by a terrible buffet which she bestows,"
3699,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"for no particular reason apparently, upon Diana, who drops her bow and"
3700,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"loses her arrows, and flies weeping to her father Jupiter. He, for his"
3701,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"part, has been watching the quarrels of his court and family with a"
3702,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,dignified amusement;--
3703,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3704,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"“Jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries,"
3705,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,And views contending gods with careless eyes.” (P.)
3706,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,
3707,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,Those philosophers who see a moral allegory in the whole of the Homeric
3708,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"story, have supplied us with a key to the conduct and feelings of"
3709,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"Jupiter during this curious combat. “Jupiter, as the lord of nature, is"
3710,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"well pleased with the war of the gods--that is, of earth, sea, air,"
3711,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,&c.--because the harmony of all beings arises from that discord. Thus
3712,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"heat and cold, moist and dry, are in a continual war, yet upon this"
3713,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,depends the fertility of the earth and the beauty of the creation. So
3714,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,"that Jupiter, who, according to the Greeks, is the soul of all, may well"
3715,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,be said to smile at this contention.”[20] Those readers who may not be
3716,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,satisfied with this solution must be content to take the burlesque as it
3717,THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.,stands.

3726,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3727,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector remains alone outside the Scæan gate, awaiting his great enemy."
3728,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,In vain his aged father and mother from the walls entreat him to take
3729,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"shelter within, like the rest of his countrymen. He will not meet the"
3730,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"just reproach of Polydamas, whose prudent counsel he rejected. The"
3731,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"deaths of his friends who have fallen in this terrible battle, which he"
3732,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"had insisted upon their risking, hang heavy on his soul. He, at least,"
3733,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,will do what he may for Troy. Yet he has no confidence in the result of
3734,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the encounter. If he were only sure that Achilles would listen, he would"
3735,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"even now offer to restore Helen, and so end this disastrous war. But he"
3736,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,feels it is too late; vengeance alone will now content Achilles.
3737,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3738,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Not this the time, nor he the man with whom"
3739,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"By forest oak or rock, like youth and maid,"
3740,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To hold light talk as youth and maid might hold.
3741,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Better to dare the fight, and know at once"
3742,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,For whom the vict’ry is decreed by Heaven.”
3743,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3744,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Achilles draws near. The courage which has never failed Hector before,"
3745,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"wholly deserts him now; he turns and flies, “like a dove from the"
3746,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"falcon.” Judged by any theory of modern heroism, his conduct is simply"
3747,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"indefensible. Critics tell us that the poet, in order to enhance the"
3748,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"glory of his chief hero, makes even the champion of Troy fear to face"
3749,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"him. But it is no compliment, in our modern eyes, to a victorious"
3750,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"warrior, to have it explained that his crowning victory was won over a"
3751,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,coward. Yet perhaps there was something of this feeling maintained even
3752,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"by Englishmen in days not so very long gone by, when it was the popular"
3753,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"fashion to represent Frenchmen generally, and the great French general"
3754,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"in particular, as always running away from the English bayonets."
3755,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"However, to Homer’s public it was evidently not incongruous or"
3756,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"derogatory to the heroic type of character, that sudden panic should"
3757,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"seize even the bravest in the presence of superior force. Hector, as has"
3758,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"been said, turns and flies for his life."
3759,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3760,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thrice round the walls of the city, his friends looking on in horror at"
3761,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the terrible race, he flies, with Achilles in pursuit. In each course he"
3762,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"tries to reach the gates, that his comrades may either open to him, or"
3763,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,at least cover him by launching their missiles from the walls against
3764,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"his enemy. But still Achilles turns him back towards the plain, signing"
3765,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"to the Greeks to hurl no spear, nor to interfere in any way with his"
3766,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,single vengeance. The gods look down from Olympus with divided interest.
3767,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Jupiter longs to save him; but Minerva sternly reminds him of the dread
3768,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,destiny--the Eternal Law--which even the Ruler of Olympus is bound to
3769,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"reverence. Once more he lifts in heaven the golden scales, and finds"
3770,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"that Hector’s fate weighs down the balance. Then, at last, his guardian"
3771,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Apollo leaves him. Minerva, on her part, comes to the aid of her"
3772,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"favourite Achilles with a stratagem, as little worthy of his renown (to"
3773,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,our view) as the sudden panic of Hector. She appears by the side of the
3774,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Trojan hero in the likeness of his brother Deiphobus, and bids him stand"
3775,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"and fight; they two, together, must surely be a match for Achilles."
3776,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector turns and challenges his adversary. One compact he tries to make,"
3777,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"in a few hurried words, before they encounter; let each promise, since"
3778,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"one must fall, to restore the dead body of his enemy in all honour to"
3779,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,his kindred. Achilles makes no reply but this:--
3780,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3781,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“Talk not to me of compacts; as ’tween men
3782,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And lions no firm concord can exist,"
3783,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite,"
3784,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,But ceaseless enmity between them dwells:
3785,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"So not in friendly terms, nor compact firm,"
3786,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Can thou and I unite, till one of us"
3787,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Glut with his blood the mail-clad warrior Mars.
3788,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Mind thee of all thy fence; behoves thee now
3789,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To prove a spearman skilled, and warrior brave."
3790,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"For thee escape is none; now, by my spear,"
3791,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hath Pallas doomed thy death: my comrade’s blood,"
3792,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Which thou hast shed, shall all be now avenged.” (D.)"
3793,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3794,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The spear launched with these words misses its mark: that of Hector
3795,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"strikes full in the centre of his enemy’s shield, but it glances"
3796,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,harmlessly off from the fire-god’s workmanship. He looks round for
3797,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Deiphobus to hand him another; but the false Deiphobus has vanished,"
3798,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"and, too late, Hector detects the cruel deceit of the goddess. He will"
3799,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"die at least as a hero should. He draws his sword, and rushes on"
3800,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Achilles. The wary Greek eyes him carefully as he comes on, and spies"
3801,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,the joint in his harness where the breastplate meets the throat. Through
3802,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"that fatal spot he drives his spear, and the Trojan falls to the ground"
3803,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"mortally wounded, but yet preserving the power of speech. As his"
3804,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"conqueror stands over him cruelly vaunting, and vowing to give his body"
3805,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"to the dogs and to the vultures, he makes a last appeal to his mercy."
3806,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“By the heads of his parents” he beseeches him to spare this last
3807,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,indignity; the ransom which his father Priam will offer shall be ample
3808,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,for one poor corpse. But the wrath of Achilles has become for the
3809,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,present mere savage madness. Neither prayer nor ransom shall avail in
3810,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,this matter. Hector’s last words are prophetic:--
3811,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3812,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“I know thee well, nor did I hope"
3813,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To change thy purpose; iron is thy soul.
3814,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,But see that on thy head I bring not down
3815,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The wrath of heaven, when by the Scæan gate"
3816,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The hand of Paris, with Apollo’s aid,"
3817,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Brave warrior as thou art, shall strike thee down.” (D.)"
3818,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3819,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The only glimpse of nobility which Achilles shows throughout the whole
3820,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,scene is in his stoical answer:--
3821,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3822,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Die thou! my fate I then shall meet, whene’er"
3823,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Jove and th’ immortal gods shall so decree.”
3824,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3825,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"What follows is mere brutality. The Greeks crowd round, and drive their"
3826,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,weapons into the senseless body.
3827,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3828,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“And one to other looked, and said, ‘Good faith,"
3829,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector is easier far to handle now,"
3830,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Than when erewhile he wrapped our ships in fire.’”
3831,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3832,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Does it need here to do more than recall the too well remembered
3833,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"sequel--how the savage victor pierced the heels of his dead enemy, and"
3834,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"so fastened the body to his chariot, and dragged him off to his ships,"
3835,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,in full sight of his agonised parents? how
3836,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3837,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“A cloud of dust the trailing body raised;
3838,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Loose hung his glossy hair; and in the dust
3839,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Was laid that noble head, so graceful once.”"
3840,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3841,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or how the miserable Priam, grovelling on the floor of his palace,"
3842,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"besought his weeping friends to suffer him to rush out of the gates, and"
3843,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"implore the mercy of the merciless Achilles? Less horrible, if not less"
3844,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"piteous, is the picture of Andromache:--"
3845,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3846,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“To her no messenger
3847,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Had brought the tidings, that without the walls"
3848,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Remained her husband; in her house withdrawn,"
3849,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"A web she wove, all purple, double woof,"
3850,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"With varied flowers in rich embroidery,"
3851,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And to her neat-haired maids she gave command
3852,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To place the largest caldrons on the fires,"
3853,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"That with warm baths, returning from the fight,"
3854,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector might be refreshed; unconscious she,"
3855,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"That by Achilles’ hand, with Pallas’ aid,"
3856,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Far from the bath, was godlike Hector slain."
3857,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The sounds of wailing reached her from the tower.
3858,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3859,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,*       *       *       *       *
3860,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3861,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Then from the house she rushed, like one distract,"
3862,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With beating heart; and with her went her maids.
3863,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But when the tower she reached, where stood the crowd,"
3864,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And mounted on the wall, and looked around,"
3865,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And saw the body trailing in the dust,"
3866,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Which the fleet steeds were dragging to the ships,"
3867,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,A sudden darkness overspread her eyes;
3868,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Backward she fell, and gasped her spirit away."
3869,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Far off were flung th’ adornments of her head,"
3870,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The net, the fillet, and the woven bands;"
3871,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The nuptial veil by golden Venus given,"
3872,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,That day when Hector of the glancing helm
3873,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Led from Eëtion’s house his wealthy bride.
3874,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The sisters of her husband round her pressed,"
3875,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And held, as in the deadly swoon she lay.” (D.)"
3876,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3877,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The body is dragged off to the ships, and flung in the dust in front of"
3878,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the bier on which Patroclus lies. And now, at last, when he has been"
3879,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"fully avenged, the due honours shall be paid to his beloved remains,"
3880,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,while the dogs and vultures feast on those of Hector. Thrice in slow
3881,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"procession, with a mournful chant, the Myrmidons lead their horses"
3882,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,round the bier. While Achilles sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion after
3883,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the long day’s battle, the shade of his dead friend appears to him, and"
3884,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"chides him for leaving him so long unburied, a wandering ghost in the"
3885,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,gloom below.
3886,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3887,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Sleep’st thou, Achilles, mindless of thy friend,"
3888,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Neglecting not the living, but the dead?"
3889,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hasten my fun’ral rites, that I may pass"
3890,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Through Hades’ gloomy gates; ere those be done,"
3891,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The spirits and spectres of departed men
3892,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Drive me far from them, nor allow to cross"
3893,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Th’ abhorred river; but forlorn and sad
3894,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,I wander through the widespread realms of night.
3895,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And give me now thy hand, whereon to weep;"
3896,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"For never more, when laid upon the pyre,"
3897,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Shall I return from Hades; never more,"
3898,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Apart from all our comrades, shall we two,"
3899,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"As friends, sweet counsel take; for me, stern Death,"
3900,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The common lot of man, has ope’d his mouth;"
3901,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thou too, Achilles, rival of the gods,"
3902,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Art destined here beneath the walls of Troy
3903,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To meet thy doom; yet one thing must I add,"
3904,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And make, if thou wilt grant it, one request:"
3905,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Let not my bones be laid apart from thine,"
3906,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Achilles, but together, as our youth"
3907,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Was spent together in thy father’s house.” (D.)
3908,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3909,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"As eager now to do honour to Achilles as he was before to insult him,"
3910,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Agamemnon has despatched a strong force at early dawn to cut down wood
3911,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,for a huge funeral pile. The burial rites are grandly savage. In long
3912,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,procession and in full panoply the Myrmidons bear the dead hero to the
3913,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"pile, and the corpse is covered with the long locks of hair which every"
3914,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"warrior in turn, Achilles first, cuts off as an offering to the gods"
3915,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"below. Four chariot-horses, and two dogs “that had fed at their master’s"
3916,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"board,” are slain upon the pile, to follow him, in case he should have"
3917,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"need of them, into the dark and unknown country: and last, the twelve"
3918,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Trojan captives, according to his barbarous vow, are slaughtered by"
3919,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Achilles in person, and laid upon the pile. The winds of heaven are"
3920,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"solemnly invoked to fan the flames, which roar and blaze all night; and"
3921,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,all night Achilles pours copious libations of wine from a golden goblet.
3922,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"With wine also the embers are quenched in the morning, and the bones of"
3923,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Patroclus are carefully collected and placed in a golden urn, to await"
3924,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the day, which Achilles foresees close at hand, when they shall be"
3925,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,buried under one mound with his own.
3926,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3927,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"There follow the funeral games. First, the chariot-race, in which Diomed"
3928,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,carries off an easy victory with the Trojan horses which he captured
3929,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"from Æneas. An easy victory, because the goddess Minerva not only breaks"
3930,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the pole of Eumelus, his most formidable rival, but hands Diomed back"
3931,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"his whip when he drops it: interpreted by our realistic critics to mean,"
3932,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,that prudence bids him take a second whip as a reserve. The old
3933,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“horse-tamer,” Nestor, gives his son Antilochus such cunning directions,"
3934,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"that he comes in second, though his horses are confessedly the slowest"
3935,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,of the whole field. Next comes the battle with the cœstus--that
3936,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"barbarous form of boxing-glove, which, far from deadening the force of"
3937,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the blow delivered, made it more damaging and dangerous, inasmuch as the"
3938,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,padding consisted of thongs of raw ox-hide well hardened. The combat in
3939,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"this case is very unequal, since the giant Epeius speedily fells his"
3940,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"younger and lighter antagonist, who is carried almost senseless from the"
3941,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,lists. The wrestlers are better matched; the skill and subtlety of
3942,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Ulysses are a counterpoise to the huge bulk and somewhat inactive
3943,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"strength of Ajax, who lifts his opponent off his feet with ease, but is"
3944,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,brought to the ground himself by a dexterous kick upon the ancle-joint.
3945,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Another fall, in which neither has the advantage, leads to the dividing"
3946,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,of the prize--though how it was to be divided practically is not so
3947,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"clear, since the first prize was a tripod valued at twelve oxen, and the"
3948,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"second a female captive, reckoned to be worth four.[21] The foot-race is"
3949,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"won by Ulysses, Minerva interfering for the second time to secure the"
3950,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"victory for her favourite, by tripping up the lesser Ajax (son of"
3951,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Oileus), who was leading. The Greek poet does but refer what we should"
3952,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,call an unlucky accident to the agency of heaven. A single combat on
3953,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"foot, with shield and spear, succeeds, the prize for which is the rich"
3954,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,armour of which Patroclus had spoiled Sarpedon. He who first draws blood
3955,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"is to be the winner. Diomed and Ajax Telamon step into the lists, and"
3956,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the combat between the two great champions grows so fierce and hot, that"
3957,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the spectators insist on their being separated, and again the honours"
3958,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"are adjudged to be equal; although Diomed, who was clearly getting the"
3959,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"advantage, receives the chief portion of the divided prize. In the"
3960,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,quoit-throwing Ajax is beaten easily; and critics have remarked that in
3961,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"no single contest does the poet allow him, though a favourite with the"
3962,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"army, to be successful. Those who insist upon the allegorical view of"
3963,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the poem, tell us that the lesson is, that brute force is of little"
3964,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"avail without counsel. The archers’ prizes are next contended for, and"
3965,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"we have the original of the story which has been borrowed, with some"
3966,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"modifications, by many imitators from Virgil’s time downwards, and"
3967,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"figures in the history of the English ‘Clym of the Clough,’ and Tell of"
3968,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Switzerland. Teucer, reputed the most skilful bowman in the whole host,"
3969,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"only shoots near enough to cut the cord which ties the dove to the mast,"
3970,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,while Meriones follows the bird with his aim as she soars far into the
3971,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"air, and brings her down, pierced through and through, with his arrow."
3972,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But Meriones had vowed an offering to Apollo “of the silver bow,” which"
3973,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Teucer, in the pride of his heart, had neglected. The games are closed"
3974,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"with hurling the spear, when the king Agamemnon himself, desirous to pay"
3975,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"all honour to his great rival’s grief, steps into the arena as a"
3976,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,competitor. With no less grace and dignity Achilles accepts the
3977,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"compliment, but forbids the contest. “O son of Atreus, we know thou dost"
3978,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,far surpass us all”--and he hands the prize for his acceptance.
3979,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
3980,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The anger against Agamemnon is past: but not so the savage wrath against
3981,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector. Combined with his passionate grief for Patroclus, it amounts to"
3982,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,madness. Morning after morning he rises from the restless couch where he
3983,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"has lain thinking of his friend, and lashing the dead corpse afresh to"
3984,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"his chariot, drags it furiously thrice round the mound that covers"
3985,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Patroclus’ ashes. Twelve days has the body now lain unburied; but Venus
3986,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,and Apollo preserve it from decay. Venus sheds over it ambrosial roseate
3987,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"unguents, and Apollo covers it with a dark cool cloud. In less"
3988,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"mythological language, the loathliness of death may not mar its beauty,"
3989,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,nor the sunbeams breed in it corruption. Even the Olympians are seized
3990,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,with horror and pity. In spite of the remonstrances of his still
3991,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"implacable queen, Jupiter instructs Thetis to visit her son. and soften"
3992,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"his cruel obduracy. At the same time he sends Iris to Priam, and"
3993,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,persuades him to implore Achilles in person to restore the body of his
3994,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"son. Accompanied by a single herald, and bearing a rich ransom, the aged"
3995,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,king passes the Greek lines by night (for Mercury himself becomes his
3996,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"guide, disguised in the form of a Greek straggler, and casts a deep"
3997,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"sleep upon the sentinels). He reaches the tent of Achilles, who has just"
3998,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"ended his evening meal, throws himself at his feet, and kisses “the"
3999,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"dreadful murderous hands by which so many of his sons have fallen,” in"
4000,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"an agony of supplication. He adjures the conqueror, by the thought of"
4001,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,his own aged father Peleus--now looking and longing for his return--to
4002,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"have some pity on a bereaved old man, whose son can never return to him"
4003,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,alive; and at least to give him back the body.
4004,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
4005,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“And for thy father’s sake look pitying down
4006,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"On me, more needing pity: since I bear"
4007,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Such grief as never man on earth hath borne,"
4008,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son.”
4009,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
4010,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"With the impulsive suddenness which is a part of his character, Achilles"
4011,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"gives way at once--prepared, indeed, to yield, by his mother’s"
4012,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,remonstrances. He gives orders to have the body clothed in costly
4013,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"raiment, and washed and anointed by the handmaidens; nay, even lifts his"
4014,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"dead enemy with his own hands, and lays him on a couch. Yet he will not"
4015,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"let Priam as yet look upon the corpse, lest at the sight of his grief"
4016,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,his own passion should break out afresh. The father spends the night in
4017,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the tent of his son’s slayer, and there he closes his eyes in sleep for"
4018,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,the first time since the day of Hector’s death. In the morning he
4019,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"returns to Troy with his mournful burden, and the funeral rites of"
4020,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Hector close the poem. The boon which Achilles has granted he makes
4021,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"complete by the spontaneous offer of twelve days’ truce, that so Troy"
4022,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,may bury her dead hero with his rightful honours. The wailings of Priam
4023,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"and Hecuba, though naturally expressed, are but commonplace compared"
4024,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,with the last tribute of the remorseful Helen:--
4025,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
4026,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Hector, of all my brethren dearest thou!"
4027,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"True, godlike Paris claims me as his wife,"
4028,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Who bore me hither--would I then had died!
4029,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But twenty years have passed since here I came,"
4030,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And left my native land; yet ne’er from thee
4031,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"I heard one scornful, one degrading word;"
4032,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And when from others I have borne reproach,"
4033,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thy brothers, sister, or thy brothers’ wives,"
4034,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Or mother (for thy sire was ever kind
4035,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Even as a father), thou hast checked them still"
4036,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With tender feeling and with gentle words.
4037,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"For thee I weep, and for myself no less,"
4038,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"For through the breadth of Troy none love me now,"
4039,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"None kindly look on me, but all abhor.” (D.)"

4046,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,CONCLUDING REMARKS.
4047,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4048,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4049,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The character of Hector has been very differently estimated. Modern
4050,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"writers upon Homer generally assume that the ancient bard had, as it"
4051,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"were, a mental picture of all his great heroes before him, of their"
4052,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"inner as well as of their outer man, and worked from this in the various"
4053,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,acts and speeches which he has assigned to each. Probably nothing could
4054,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,be further from the truth. If the poet could be questioned as to his
4055,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"immortal work, and required to give a detailed character of each of his"
4056,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"chief personages, such as his modern admirers present us with, he would"
4057,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,most likely confess that such character as his heroes possess was built
4058,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"up by degrees, as occasion called for them to act and speak, and that"
4059,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,his own portraits (where they were not derived from the current
4060,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,traditions) rested but little upon any preconceived ideal. It is very
4061,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,difficult to estimate character at all in a work of fiction in which the
4062,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,principles of conduct are in many respects so different from those of
4063,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,our own age. How far even the ablest critics have succeeded in the
4064,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,attempt in the case of Hector may be judged from this; that whereas
4065,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Colonel Mure speaks of “a turn for vainglorious boasting” as his
4066,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"characteristic defect,[22] Mr Froude remarks that “while Achilles is all"
4067,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"pride, Hector is all modesty.”[23] Both criticisms are from writers of"
4068,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,competent taste and judgment; but both cannot possibly be true. There
4069,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,can be no doubt that Hector makes a considerable number of vaunting
4070,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,speeches in the course of the poem--vaunts which he does not always
4071,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,carry out; but in this respect he differs rather in degree than in
4072,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"principle from most of the other warriors, Greek as well as Trojan; and"
4073,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"if the boasts of Achilles are always made good, while Hector’s often"
4074,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"come to nothing, that follows almost necessarily from the fact that"
4075,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Achilles is the hero of the tale. A boastful tongue and a merciless
4076,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,spirit are attributes of the heroic character in Homer: his heroes bear
4077,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,a singular resemblance in these two points to the “braves” of the
4078,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,American Indians; while they are utterly unlike them in their
4079,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"sensitiveness to physical pain, their undisguised horror of death, and"
4080,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,their proneness to give loud expression to both feelings. Without
4081,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"attempting to sketch a full-length portrait, which probably Homer"
4082,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"himself would not recognise, it may be said that Hector interests us"
4083,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"chiefly because he is far more human than Achilles, in his weakness as"
4084,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"well as in his strength; his honest love for his wife and child, his"
4085,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"pitying condonation of Helen, his half-contemptuous kindness to his weak"
4086,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"brother Paris, his hearty and unselfish devotion to his country."
4087,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Achilles is the “hero,” indeed, in the classical sense--_i.e._, he is"
4088,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the demi-god, superior to many of the mortal weaknesses which are"
4089,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,palpable enough in the character of his antagonist: as little
4090,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"susceptible to Hector’s alternations of confidence and panic, as to his"
4091,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,tender anxieties about his wife and child. The contrast between the two
4092,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"is very remarkable; as strong, though of quite a different kind, as that"
4093,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"between the two chief female characters in the poem--Helen, charming"
4094,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"even in her frailty, attracting us and compelling our admiration in"
4095,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"spite of our moral judgment; Andromache, the blameless wife and mother,"
4096,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"whose charm is the beauty of true womanhood, and whose portrait, as"
4097,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"drawn by the poet, bears strong witness by its sweetness and purity to"
4098,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the essential soundness of the domestic relations in the age which he
4099,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,depicts.
4100,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4101,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"The poem, as we have seen, ends somewhat abruptly. We learn nothing from"
4102,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"it of the fate of Troy, except so far as we have been taught throughout"
4103,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the tale that the fortunes of the city and people depended wholly upon
4104,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Hector. “Achilles’ wrath” was the theme of the song, and now that this"
4105,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"has been appeased, we wait for no further catastrophe. Yet, if Achilles"
4106,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"has been the hero, it is remarkable that the poet’s parting sympathies"
4107,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"appear to rest, as those of the reader almost certainly will, with"
4108,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Hector. It would seem that Homer himself felt something of what he makes
4109,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Jupiter express with regard to the Trojans--“They interest me, though"
4110,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"they must needs perish.” The Trojan hero must fall, or the glory of the"
4111,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Greek could not be consummated; but the last words of the poem, as they"
4112,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"record his funeral honours, so they express the poet’s regretful"
4113,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,eulogy:--
4114,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4115,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“Such honours paid they to the good knight Hector.”
4116,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4117,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Virgil, in his Æneid, naturally exalts the glory of Hector, because it"
4118,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,was his purpose to trace the origin of the Romans from Troy; but we
4119,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"need not wonder that in later days, when the Homeric legends were worked"
4120,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"up into tales of Christian chivalry, Hector, and not Achilles, became"
4121,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the model of a Christian knight. When the great Italian poet drew his
4122,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"character of Orlando, as a type of chivalry, he had the Trojan hero in"
4123,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,his mind.
4124,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4125,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,One of the earliest and most curious travesties of the Iliad--for it is
4126,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"hardly more, though made in all good faith, according to the taste of"
4127,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the times--was the work of an English troubadour, Benedict de St Maur,"
4128,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of the time of Henry II. It was reproduced, as a prose romance, in"
4129,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Latin, by Guido de Colonna, a Sicilian; but is better known--so far as"
4130,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,it can be said to be known at all--as the ‘History of the Warres of the
4131,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Greeks and Trojans,’ by John Lydgate, monk of Bury St Edmunds, first"
4132,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,printed in 1513. The writer professedly takes Colonna as his original.
4133,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The heroes of the Iliad reappear as the knights of modern chivalry; they
4134,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"fight on horseback, observe all the rules of medieval courtesy, and"
4135,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“fewtre their speres” at each other exactly in the style of the
4136,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Companions of the Round Table. Agamemnon is very like Arthur, and"
4137,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Achilles Sir Lancelot, under other names. But Hector is here also"
4138,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"plainly the favourite hero. Thersites figures as a dwarf, with all the"
4139,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"malice and mischief peculiar, and in some degree permitted, to those"
4140,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,imaginary types of humanity. The closing lines of Lydgate’s third book
4141,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,will give some idea of the strange transformation which Homer’s story
4142,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"undergoes in the hands of our medieval poet, and is a curious instance"
4143,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,of the way in which the zealous churchman “improves” his pagan subject.
4144,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,He is describing the funeral rites of Hector:--
4145,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4146,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“And when Priam in full thrifty wyse
4147,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Performed hath as ye have heard devyse,"
4148,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Ordained eke, as Guido[24] can you tell,"
4149,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,A certain nombre of priestes for to dwell
4150,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"In the temple in their devotions,"
4151,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Continually with devout orisons
4152,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,For the soule of Hector for to pray.
4153,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4154,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,*       *       *       *       *
4155,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4156,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"To which priestes the kyng gave mansyons,"
4157,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"There to abide, and possessyons,"
4158,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The which he hath to them mortysed
4159,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Perpetually, as ye have heard devysed,"
4160,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"And while they kneel, pray, and wake,"
4161,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,I caste fully me an end to make
4162,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Finally of this my thirde booke
4163,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,On my rude manner as I undertooke.”
4164,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4165,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The way in which the Homeric characters are modernised in Chaucer and
4166,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Dryden, and even in Shakspeare’s ‘Troilus and Cressida,’ is a deviation"
4167,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"from their originals hardly more excusable, though less absurd, than"
4168,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"this of Lydgate’s. They copied, in fact, not from the original at all,"
4169,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,but from the medieval corruptions of it. Racine’s tragedies are in a
4170,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"higher vein, and his Iphigenia, though not Homer’s story, does more"
4171,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"justice to some of Homer’s characters: but after all, as has been well"
4172,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"observed, “they are dressed in the Parisian fashions, with speech and"
4173,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,action accordingly.”[25]
4174,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4175,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"The Iliad, as has been already remarked, closes more abruptly than its"
4176,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"modern title would seem to justify, for the Tale of Troy is left half"
4177,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"untold. Imitators of the great bard followed him, and though their works"
4178,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"are lost to us, the legends upon which they worked have been reproduced"
4179,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,by later writers. The poems once known as the ‘Little Iliad’ and the
4180,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"‘Sacking of Troy’ have left little more than their names, and some few"
4181,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"fragments which, do not raise much regret for the loss of the"
4182,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,remainder; but the leading events of which they treated are preserved in
4183,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the works of the Greek dramatists and of Virgil. It may not be out of
4184,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,place here to sketch briefly the sequel to Homer’s story.
4185,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4186,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Troy fell in that tenth year of the siege, though new and remarkable"
4187,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,allies came to the aid of Priam. From the far north of Thrace came a
4188,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"band of Amazons--women-warriors who, in spite of their weaker sex,"
4189,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,proved more than a match in battle for the men of Greece. Their queen
4190,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Penthesilea was said to be the daughter of the War-god; and under her
4191,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"leading, once more the Trojans tried their fortune in the open field,"
4192,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"not unsuccessfully, until she too fell by the spear of Achilles."
4193,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Proceeding to possess himself of her helmet, as the conqueror’s spoil,"
4194,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"he was struck with her remarkable beauty, and stood entranced for some"
4195,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,moments in sorrow and admiration. It is the scene from which Tasso
4196,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"borrows his story of Clorinda, and which Spenser had in his mind when he"
4197,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"makes Sir Artegal, after having unhelmed the fair Britomart in combat,"
4198,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,let fall his sword at the sight of her “angel-face”--
4199,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4200,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"“His powerless hand, benumbed with secret fear,"
4201,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"From his revengefull purpose shronke abacke,"
4202,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,And cruel sword out of his fingers slacke
4203,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Fell down to ground, as if the steel had sence"
4204,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"And felt some ruth, or sence his hand did lacke,"
4205,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Or both of them did think obedience
4206,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,To doe to so divine a Beautie’s excellence.”
4207,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,--B. IV. c. vi. st. 21.
4208,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4209,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Thersites--who had by this time forgotten the chastisement inflicted on
4210,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,him by Ulysses for his scurrilous tongue--ventured a jest upon Achilles’
4211,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"sensibility, and was struck dead by a blow from the hero’s unarmed"
4212,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"hand. Next came upon the scene the tall Ethiopian Memnon, son of the"
4213,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Dawn, a warrior of more than mortal beauty, sent either from Egypt or"
4214,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"from the king of Assyria (for the legends vary), with a contingent of"
4215,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"fierce negro warriors, who carried slaughter into the Greek ranks, until"
4216,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Memnon too fell by the hand of the same irresistible antagonist. These
4217,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,were only brief respites for the doomed city. But it was not to fall by
4218,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the hand of Achilles. Before its day of destruction came, the Greek hero"
4219,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,had met with the fate which he himself foresaw--which had been
4220,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"prophesied for him alike by his mother the sea-goddess, by the wondrous"
4221,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"utterance of his horse Xanthus, and by the dying words of Hector. An"
4222,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"arrow from Paris found the single vulnerable spot in his right heel, and"
4223,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,stretched him where he had slain his Trojan enemy--before the Scæan
4224,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"gate. But his death, according to the legends, was no more like that of"
4225,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,common mortals than his life had been. He does not go down into those
4226,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,gloomy regions where the ghosts of his friend Patroclus and his enemy
4227,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Hector wander. It was not death, but a translation. The Greeks had"
4228,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"prepared for him a magnificent funeral pile, but the body of the hero"
4229,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,suddenly disappeared. His mother Thetis conveyed it away to the island
4230,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of Leukè in the Euxine Sea, to enjoy in that seclusion a new and"
4231,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,perpetual life. So early is the legend which the romance of Christendom
4232,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"adopted for so many of its favourites--notably for the English Arthur,"
4233,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,borne by the three mysterious queens to
4234,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4235,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"“The island valley of Avilion,”"
4236,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4237,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"where, it was long said and believed, he lay either in a charmed sleep"
4238,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"or a passionless immortality. One legend ran that the Greek hero, in his"
4239,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"happy island, was favoured with the society of Helen, whose matchless"
4240,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,beauty he had much desired to see.
4241,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4242,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,His wondrous shield and armour--the masterpieces of Vulcan--were left by
4243,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Thetis as a prize for “the bravest of the Greeks,” and became almost as"
4244,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,fatal a source of discord as the golden apple which had been labelled
4245,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,for “the fairest.” Ulysses and Ajax were the most distinguished
4246,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"claimants, and when, as before, counsel was preferred to strength, Ajax"
4247,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"went mad with vexation, and fell upon his own sword. Ulysses handed on"
4248,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the coveted armour to its rightful inheritor, the young Neoptolemus, son"
4249,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of Achilles, who, in accordance with an oracle, had been sent for to"
4250,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"take Troy. Still the city held out, secure so long as the sacred image"
4251,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of Minerva, the “Palladium,” a gift from Jupiter himself, remained in"
4252,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the citadel: until Ulysses broke the spell by entering within the walls
4253,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"in disguise, and carrying it off. One quick eye discovered the venturous"
4254,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Greek, through his rags and self-inflicted wounds: Helen recognised him;"
4255,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"but she was weary of her guilty life, and became an excusable traitress"
4256,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,in favour of her lawful husband. It was again the fertile brain of
4257,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Ulysses which conceived the stratagem of the wooden horse; and when the
4258,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"curiosity of the Trojans (against all ordinary probabilities, it must be"
4259,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"confessed) dragged it inside the walls, the armed warriors whom it"
4260,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"contained issued forth in the night, and opened the gates to their"
4261,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,comrades.
4262,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4263,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The details of the sack of the city are neither more nor less horrible
4264,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,than similar scenes which are unhappily too historical. Priam is slain
4265,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"at the altar of his house; his family either share his fate, or are"
4266,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,carried into captivity. Of the contradictory legends as to the fate of
4267,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“Hector’s Andromache”--as in Virgil’s great poem she pathetically calls
4268,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"herself--the reader will gladly choose, with that poet, the least"
4269,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"painful version, which leaves her settled at Buthrotus in Epirus, in a"
4270,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"peaceful retirement full of gentle regrets, as the wife of Hector’s"
4271,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,brother Helenus.
4272,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
4273,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Of Helen and Menelaus we shall hear more in Homer’s tale of the
4274,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Wanderings of Ulysses. He says nothing of the scene which the later
4275,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"dramatists give us, by no means inconsistent with his own portrait of"
4276,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the pair, when at the taking of the city the outraged husband rushes"
4277,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"upon the adulteress with uplifted sword, and drops his weapon at the"
4278,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,sight of her well-remembered and matchless beauty. For the miserable
4279,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,sequel of Agamemnon’s story we may refer also to the Odyssey. Few of the
4280,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Greek heroes returned home in peace. They had insulted the gods of Troy,"
4281,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,and they were cursed with toilsome wanderings and long banishment like
4282,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Ulysses, or met with a worse fate still. Diomed did not indeed leave his"
4283,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"wife Ægiale a heart-broken widow, as Dione in her anger had predicted,"
4284,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,but found on his return that she had consoled herself with another lover
4285,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"in his absence, and narrowly escaped assassination by her hand. Teucer"
4286,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"was refused a home by his father, because he did not bring his brother"
4287,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Ajax back with him to the old man. The lesser Ajax was wrecked and
4288,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"drowned on his homeward voyage. Fate spared Nestor, old as he was, to"
4289,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,return to his stronghold at Pylos; but his son Antilochus had fallen in
4290,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the flower of his age on the plains of Troy. The names of many of the
4291,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,wanderers were preserved in the colonies which they founded along the
4292,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"coasts of Greece and Italy, and the heroes of the great Siege of Troy"
4293,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,spread its fame over all the then known world.

4383,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
4384,INTRODUCTION.,
4385,INTRODUCTION.,
4386,INTRODUCTION.,The poem of the Odyssey is treated in these pages as the work of a
4387,INTRODUCTION.,"single author, and that author the same as the composer of the Iliad. It"
4388,INTRODUCTION.,"would be manifestly out of place, in a volume which does not profess to"
4389,INTRODUCTION.,"be written for critical scholars, to discuss a question on which they"
4390,INTRODUCTION.,are so far from being agreed. But it may be satisfactory to assure the
4391,INTRODUCTION.,reader who has neither leisure nor inclination to enter into the
4392,INTRODUCTION.,"controversy, that in accepting, as we do, the Odyssey as from the same"
4393,INTRODUCTION.,"“Homer” to whom we owe the Tale of Troy, he may fortify himself by the"
4394,INTRODUCTION.,authority of many accomplished scholars who have carefully examined the
4395,INTRODUCTION.,question. Though none of the incidents related in the Iliad are
4396,INTRODUCTION.,distinctly referred to in the Odyssey--a point strongly urged by those
4397,INTRODUCTION.,who would assign the poems to different authors--and therefore the one
4398,INTRODUCTION.,"cannot fairly be regarded as a sequel to the other, yet there is no"
4399,INTRODUCTION.,"important discrepancy, either in the facts previously assumed, or in the"
4400,INTRODUCTION.,treatment of such characters as appear upon the scene in both.
4401,INTRODUCTION.,
4402,INTRODUCTION.,"The character of the two poems is, indeed, essentially different. The"
4403,INTRODUCTION.,Iliad is a tale of the camp and the battle-field: the Odyssey combines
4404,INTRODUCTION.,the romance of travel with that of domestic life. The key-note of the
4405,INTRODUCTION.,Iliad is glory: that of the Odyssey is rest. This was amongst the
4406,INTRODUCTION.,reasons which led one of the earliest of Homer’s critics to the
4407,INTRODUCTION.,conclusion that the Odyssey was the work of his old age. In both poems
4408,INTRODUCTION.,"the interest lies in the situations and the descriptions, rather than in"
4409,INTRODUCTION.,what we moderns call the “plot.” This latter is not a main consideration
4410,INTRODUCTION.,"with the poet, and he has no hesitation in disclosing his catastrophe"
4411,INTRODUCTION.,"beforehand. The interest, so far as this point is concerned, is also"
4412,INTRODUCTION.,weakened for the modern reader by the intervention throughout of
4413,INTRODUCTION.,"supernatural agents, who, at the most critical turns of the story, throw"
4414,INTRODUCTION.,"their irresistible weight into the scale. Yet, in spite of this, the"
4415,INTRODUCTION.,interest of the Odyssey is intensely human. Greek mythology and Oriental
4416,INTRODUCTION.,"romance are large ingredients in the poem, but its men and women are"
4417,INTRODUCTION.,"drawn by a master’s hand from the actual life; and, since in the two"
4418,INTRODUCTION.,thousand years between our own and Homer’s day nothing has changed so
4419,INTRODUCTION.,"little as human nature, therefore very much of it is still a story of"
4420,INTRODUCTION.,to-day.
4421,INTRODUCTION.,
4422,INTRODUCTION.,The poem before us is the tale of the wanderings and adventures of
4423,INTRODUCTION.,"Odysseus--or Ulysses, as the softer tongue of the Latins preferred to"
4424,INTRODUCTION.,call him--on his way home from the siege of Troy to his island-kingdom
4425,INTRODUCTION.,of Ithaca. The name Odysseus has been variously interpreted. Homer
4426,INTRODUCTION.,"himself, who should be the best authority, tells us that it was given to"
4427,INTRODUCTION.,him by his grandfather Autolycus to signify “the child of hate.” Others
4428,INTRODUCTION.,have interpreted it to mean “suffering;” and some ingenious scholars see
4429,INTRODUCTION.,in it only the ancient form of a familiar sobriquet by which the hero
4430,INTRODUCTION.,"was known, “the little one,” or “the dwarf,”--a conjecture which derives"
4431,INTRODUCTION.,some support from the fact that the Tyrrhenians knew him under that
4432,INTRODUCTION.,designation. It may be remembered that in the Iliad he is described as
4433,INTRODUCTION.,bearing no comparison in stature with the stalwart forms of Agamemnon
4434,INTRODUCTION.,and Menelaus; and it is implied in the description that there was some
4435,INTRODUCTION.,"want of proportion in his figure, since he appeared nobler than Menelaus"
4436,INTRODUCTION.,when both sat down. But in the Odyssey itself there appears no reference
4437,INTRODUCTION.,to any natural defect of any kind. His character in this poem
4438,INTRODUCTION.,"corresponds perfectly with that which is disclosed in the Iliad. There,"
4439,INTRODUCTION.,he is the leading spirit of the Greeks when in council. Scarcely second
4440,INTRODUCTION.,"to Achilles or Diomed in personal prowess, his advice and opinion are"
4441,INTRODUCTION.,listened to with as much respect as those of the veteran Nestor. In the
4442,INTRODUCTION.,"Iliad, too, he is, as he is called in the present poem, “the man of many"
4443,INTRODUCTION.,devices.” His accomplishments cover a larger field than those of any
4444,INTRODUCTION.,other hero. Achilles only can beat him in speed of foot; he is as good
4445,INTRODUCTION.,an archer as Ajax Oileus or Teucer; he throws Ajax the Great in the
4446,INTRODUCTION.,"wrestling-match, in spite of his superior strength, by a happy use of"
4447,INTRODUCTION.,"science, and divides with him the prize of victory. To him, as the"
4448,INTRODUCTION.,worthiest successor of Achilles--on the testimony of the Trojan
4449,INTRODUCTION.,"prisoners, who declared that he had wrought them most harm of any--the"
4450,INTRODUCTION.,armour of that great hero was awarded at his death. He is not tragic
4451,INTRODUCTION.,"enough to fill the first place in the Iliad, but we are quite prepared"
4452,INTRODUCTION.,to find him the hero of a story of travel and adventure like the
4453,INTRODUCTION.,"Odyssey, in which the grand figure of Achilles would be entirely out of"
4454,INTRODUCTION.,place.
4455,INTRODUCTION.,
4456,INTRODUCTION.,"The Odyssey has been pronounced, by a high classical authority, to be"
4457,INTRODUCTION.,"emphatically a lady’s book. “The Iliad,” says the great Bentley, “Homer"
4458,INTRODUCTION.,"made for men, and the Odyssey for the other sex.” This opinion somewhat"
4459,INTRODUCTION.,contradicts the criticism of an older and greater master--Aristotle--who
4460,INTRODUCTION.,"defines the Odyssey as being “ethic and complex,” while the Iliad is"
4461,INTRODUCTION.,“pathetic and simple.” Yet it was perhaps some such notion of the
4462,INTRODUCTION.,"fitness of things which made Fénélon’s adaptation of Homer’s story, ‘The"
4463,INTRODUCTION.,"Adventures of Telemachus in search of Ulysses,’ so popular a French"
4464,INTRODUCTION.,"text-book in ladies’ schools a century ago. It is certain, also, that"
4465,INTRODUCTION.,"the allusions in our modern literature, and the subjects of modern"
4466,INTRODUCTION.,"pictures, are drawn from the Odyssey even more frequently than from the"
4467,INTRODUCTION.,"Iliad, although the former has never been so generally read in our"
4468,INTRODUCTION.,"schools and colleges. Circe and the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, have"
4469,INTRODUCTION.,pointed more morals than any incidents in the Siege of Troy. Turner’s
4470,INTRODUCTION.,"pictures of Nausicaa and her Maidens, the Gardens of Alcinous, the"
4471,INTRODUCTION.,"Cyclops addressed by Ulysses, the Song of the Sirens--all amongst our"
4472,INTRODUCTION.,national heirlooms of art--assume a fair acquaintance with the later
4473,INTRODUCTION.,Homeric fable on the part of the public for whom they were painted. The
4474,INTRODUCTION.,"secret of this greater popularity may lie in the fact, that while the"
4475,INTRODUCTION.,"adventures in the Odyssey have more of the romantic and the imaginative,"
4476,INTRODUCTION.,the heroes are less heroic--have more of the common human type about
4477,INTRODUCTION.,them--than those of the Iliad. The colossal figure of Achilles in his
4478,INTRODUCTION.,wrath does not affect us so nearly as the wandering voyager with his
4479,INTRODUCTION.,"strange adventures, his hairbreadth escapes, and his not over-scrupulous"
4480,INTRODUCTION.,devices.
4481,INTRODUCTION.,
4482,INTRODUCTION.,To our English sympathies the Odyssey appeals strongly for another
4483,INTRODUCTION.,"reason--it is a tale of voyage and discovery. “It is,” as Dean Alford"
4484,INTRODUCTION.,"says, “of all poems a poem of the sea.” In the Iliad the poet never"
4485,INTRODUCTION.,missed an opportunity of letting us know that--whoever he was and
4486,INTRODUCTION.,"wherever he was born--he knew the sea well, and had a seaman’s tastes."
4487,INTRODUCTION.,"But there his tale confined him chiefly to the plain before Troy, and"
4488,INTRODUCTION.,such opportunities presented themselves but rarely. In the Odyssey we
4489,INTRODUCTION.,"roam from sea to sea throughout the narrative, and the restless hero"
4490,INTRODUCTION.,seems never so much at home as when he is on shipboard. It is not
4491,INTRODUCTION.,without reason that the most ancient works of art which bear the figure
4492,INTRODUCTION.,of Ulysses represent him not as a warrior but as a sailor.
4493,INTRODUCTION.,
4494,INTRODUCTION.,"The Tale of Troy, as has been already said, embraces in its whole range"
4495,INTRODUCTION.,three decades of years. It is with the last ten that the Odyssey has to
4496,INTRODUCTION.,"do; and as in the Iliad, though the siege itself had consumed ten years,"
4497,INTRODUCTION.,it is with the last year only that the poet deals; so in this second
4498,INTRODUCTION.,"great poem also, the main action occupies no more than the last six"
4499,INTRODUCTION.,weeks of the third and concluding decade.
4500,INTRODUCTION.,
4501,INTRODUCTION.,"Between the Iliad and the Odyssey there is an interval of events, not"
4502,INTRODUCTION.,"related in either poem, but which a Greek audience of the poet’s own day"
4503,INTRODUCTION.,would readily supply for themselves out of a store of current legend
4504,INTRODUCTION.,"quite familiar to their minds, and embodied in more than one ancient"
4505,INTRODUCTION.,"poem now lost to us.[26] Troy, after the long siege, had fallen at last;"
4506,INTRODUCTION.,but not to Achilles. For him the dying prophecy of Hector had been soon
4507,INTRODUCTION.,"fulfilled, and an arrow from the bow of Paris had stretched him in"
4508,INTRODUCTION.,"death, like his noble enemy, “before the Scæan gates.” It was his son"
4509,INTRODUCTION.,"Neoptolemus, “the red-haired,” to whom the oracles pointed as the"
4510,INTRODUCTION.,"destined captor of the city. Ulysses went back to Greece to fetch him,"
4511,INTRODUCTION.,"and even handed over to the young hero, on his arrival, the armour of"
4512,INTRODUCTION.,his father--his own much-valued prize. In that armour Neoptolemus led
4513,INTRODUCTION.,"the Greeks to the storm and sack of the city by night, while the Trojans"
4514,INTRODUCTION.,were either asleep or holding deep carousal.
4515,INTRODUCTION.,
4516,INTRODUCTION.,"It has been conjectured by some that, under the name of Ulysses, the"
4517,INTRODUCTION.,"poet has but described, with more or less of that licence to which he"
4518,INTRODUCTION.,"had a double claim as poet and as traveller, his own wanderings and"
4519,INTRODUCTION.,"adventures by land and sea. It has been argued, in a treatise of some"
4520,INTRODUCTION.,"ingenuity,[27] that the poet, whoever he was, was himself a native of"
4521,INTRODUCTION.,the island in which he places the home of his hero. There is certainly
4522,INTRODUCTION.,one passage which reads very much like the circumstantial and loving
4523,INTRODUCTION.,"description which a poet would give of his sea-girt birthplace, with"
4524,INTRODUCTION.,every nook of which he would have been familiar from his childhood. It
4525,INTRODUCTION.,occurs in the scene where Ulysses is at last landed on the coast of
4526,INTRODUCTION.,"Ithaca, which he is slow to recognise until his divine guide points out"
4527,INTRODUCTION.,to him the different localities within sight:--
4528,INTRODUCTION.,
4529,INTRODUCTION.,"“This is the port of sea-king Phorcys old,"
4530,INTRODUCTION.,And this the olive at the haven’s brow.
4531,INTRODUCTION.,"Yonder the deep dark lovely cave behold,"
4532,INTRODUCTION.,Shrine of the Naïad-nymphs! These shades enfold
4533,INTRODUCTION.,"The stone-roofed bower, wherein thou oft hast stood,"
4534,INTRODUCTION.,"While to the Nymphs thy frequent vows uprolled,"
4535,INTRODUCTION.,Steam of choice hecatombs and offerings good.
4536,INTRODUCTION.,"Neritus hill stands there, high-crowned with waving wood.”[28]"
4537,INTRODUCTION.,
4538,INTRODUCTION.,As conjecture only all such theories must remain; but it may at least be
4539,INTRODUCTION.,safely believed that the author had himself visited some of the strange
4540,INTRODUCTION.,"lands which he describes, with whatever amount of fabulous ornament he"
4541,INTRODUCTION.,"may have enriched his tale, and it has a certain interest for the reader"
4542,INTRODUCTION.,to entertain the possibility of a personal narrative thus underlying the
4543,INTRODUCTION.,romance.

4559,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"wanderings, have at length reached their homes, with one"
4560,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,exception--Ulysses has not been heard of in his island-kingdom of
4561,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Ithaca. Ten years have nearly passed since the fall of Troy, and still"
4562,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"his wife Penelope, and his aged father Laertes, and his young son"
4563,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Telemachus, now growing up to manhood, keep weary watch for the hero’s"
4564,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"return. There is, moreover, a twofold trouble in the house. It is not"
4565,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"only anxiety for an absent husband, but the perplexity caused by a crowd"
4566,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of importunate suitors for her hand, which vexes the soul of Penelope"
4567,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,from day to day. The young nobles of Ithaca and its dependent islands
4568,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,have for many years flocked to the palace to seek the hand of her whom
4569,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,they consider as virtually a widowed queen. It is to no purpose that
4570,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,she professes her own firm belief that Ulysses still survives: she has
4571,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"no kind of proof of his existence, and the suitors demand of her"
4572,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,that--in accordance with what would appear the custom of the
4573,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,country--she shall make choice of some one among them to take the lost
4574,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"hero’s place, and enjoy all the rights of sovereignty. How far the"
4575,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"lovers were attracted by the wealth and position of the lady, and how"
4576,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"far by the force of her personal charms, is a point somewhat hard to"
4577,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,decide. The Roman poet Horace imputes to them the less romantic motive.
4578,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"They were, he says, of that class of prudent wooers--"
4579,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4580,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,“Who prized good living more than ladies’ love;”
4581,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4582,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and he even hints that Penelope’s knowledge of their real sentiments
4583,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"helped to account for her obduracy. But Horace, we must remember, was a"
4584,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,satirist by trade. A mere prosaic reader might be tempted to raise the
4585,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"question whether the personal charms of Penelope, irresistible as they"
4586,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"might have been when Ulysses first left her for the war, must not have"
4587,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,been somewhat impaired during the twenty years of his absence; and
4588,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,whether it was possible for a widow of that date (especially with a
4589,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,grown-up son continually present as a memento) to inspire such very
4590,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,ardent admiration. These arithmetical critics have always been the pests
4591,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,of poetry. One very painstaking antiquarian--Jacob Bryant--in the course
4592,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of his studies on the Iliad, made the discovery, by a comparison of"
4593,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"mythological dates, that Helen herself must have been nearly a hundred"
4594,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,years old at the taking of Troy. But the question of age has been
4595,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,unanimously voted impertinent by all her modern admirers: she still
4596,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,shines in our fancy with
4597,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4598,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,“The starlike beauty of immortal eyes”
4599,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4600,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,which the Laureate saw in his ‘Dream of Fair Women.’ The heroic legends
4601,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"take no count of years. Woman is there beautiful by divine right of sex,"
4602,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"unless in those few special instances in which, for the purposes of the"
4603,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"story, particular persons are necessarily represented as old and"
4604,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,decrepit. Nor is there any ground for supposing that the suitors of
4605,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Penelope, like the courtiers of Queen Elizabeth, persisted in"
4606,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,attributing to her fictitious charms. She is evidently not less
4607,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,beautiful in the poet’s eyes than in theirs. As beauty has been happily
4608,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"said to be, after all, “the lover’s gift,” so also the bestowal of it"
4609,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,upon whom he will must be allowed to be the privilege of the poet. The
4610,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"island-queen herself says, indeed, that her beauty had fled when Ulysses"
4611,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"left her, and could only be restored by his return; but this disclaimer"
4612,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,from the lips of a loving and mourning wife only makes her more
4613,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"charming, and she is not the only woman, ancient or modern, who has"
4614,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,borrowed an additional fascination from her tears.
4615,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4616,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"The suitors of Penelope, strange to say, are living at free quarters in"
4617,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"the palace of the absent Ulysses. Telemachus is too young, apparently,"
4618,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,to assert his rights as master of the house on his own or his mother’s
4619,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,behalf. If the picture be true to the life--and there is no good reason
4620,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,to suppose it otherwise--we must assume an age of rude licence even in
4621,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"the midst of considerable civilisation, when, unless a king or chief"
4622,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"could hold his own by the strong hand, there was small chance of his"
4623,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,rights being respected. A partial explanation may also lie in the fact
4624,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,that the wealth of the king was regarded as in some sort public
4625,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"property, and that to keep open house for all whose rank entitled them"
4626,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,to sit at his table was probably a popular branch of the royal
4627,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"prerogative. Telemachus is an only son, and he and his mother have"
4628,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,apparently no near kinsmen to avenge any wrong or insult that may be
4629,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"offered. There is, besides, somewhat of weakness and tameness in his"
4630,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"character, more than befits the son of such a father. He is a"
4631,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"home-nurtured youth, of a gentle and kindly nature, a dutiful and"
4632,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,affectionate son; but his temperament is far too easy for the rude and
4633,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"troublous times in which his lot is cast, and the roystering crew who"
4634,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,profess at least to be the wooers of Penelope have not been slow to find
4635,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,it out. Some kindly critics (“Christopher North” among the number) have
4636,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,refused to see any of these shortcomings in the young prince’s
4637,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,character; but his father Ulysses saw them plainly. For thus it is he
4638,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"speaks, at a later period of the tale, under his disguise of a"
4639,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,mendicant:--
4640,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4641,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“Had I but youth as I have heart, or were"
4642,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"The blameless brave Ulysses, or his son,"
4643,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Then let a stranger strike me headless there,"
4644,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,If against any I leave revenge undone!”
4645,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4646,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,But this is anticipating somewhat too much. We must return to the
4647,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,opening of the poem.
4648,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4649,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"The fate of Ulysses, so far as any knowledge of it has reached his wife"
4650,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"and son, lies yet in mystery. Only the gods know--and perhaps it were as"
4651,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,well for Penelope not to know--in what unworthy thraldom he is held. He
4652,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"has incurred the anger of the great Sea-god, and therefore he is still"
4653,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,forbidden to reach his home. He has lain captive now for seven long
4654,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"years in Ogygia, the enchanted realm of Calypso--"
4655,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4656,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“Girded of ocean in an island-keep,"
4657,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"An island clothed with trees, the navel of the deep."
4658,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4659,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“There dwells the child of Atlas, who can sound"
4660,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"All seas, and eke doth hold the pillars tall"
4661,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Which keep the skies asunder from the ground.
4662,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"There him, still sorrowing, she doth aye enthral,"
4663,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Weaving serene enticements to forestal
4664,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,The memory of his island-realm.”
4665,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4666,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"But the goddess of wisdom, who was his protecting genius throughout the"
4667,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"perils of the great siege, and by whose aid, as we have seen in the"
4668,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Iliad, he has distanced so many formidable competitors in the race for"
4669,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"glory, has not forgotten her favourite. The opening scene of the Odyssey"
4670,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,shows us the gods in council on Olympus. Neptune alone is absent; he is
4671,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"gone to feast, like Jupiter in the Iliad, with those mysterious people,"
4672,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,the far-off Æthiopians--
4673,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4674,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“Extreme of men, who diverse ways retire,"
4675,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Some to the setting, some the rising sun.”"
4676,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4677,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Minerva takes the opportunity of his absence to remind the Father of the
4678,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"gods of the hard fate of Ulysses, so unworthy of a hero who has deserved"
4679,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"so well both of gods and men. It is agreed to send Mercury, the"
4680,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"messenger of the Immortals, to the island where Calypso holds Ulysses"
4681,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"captive in her toils, to announce to him that the day of his return"
4682,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"draws near. Minerva herself, meanwhile, will go to Ithaca, and put"
4683,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"strength into the heart of his son Telemachus, that he may rid his house"
4684,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of this hateful brood of revellers, and set forth to make search for his"
4685,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"father. The passage in which the poet describes her visit is a fine one,"
4686,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and it has been finely rendered by Mr Worsley:--
4687,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4688,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“So ending, underneath her feet she bound"
4689,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Her faery sandals of ambrosial gold,"
4690,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Which o’er the waters and the solid ground
4691,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Swifter than wind have borne her from of old;
4692,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Then on the iron-pointed spear laid hold,"
4693,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Heavy and tall, wherewith she smites the brood"
4694,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Of heroes till her anger waxes cold;
4695,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Then from Olympus swept in eager mood,"
4696,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,And with the island-people in the court she stood
4697,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4698,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,“Fast by the threshold of the outer gate
4699,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Of brave Odysseus: in her hand she bore
4700,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"The iron-pointed spear, heavy and great,"
4701,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"And, waiting as a guest-friend at the door,"
4702,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Of Mentes, Taphian chief, the likeness wore;"
4703,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"There found the suitors, who beguiled with play"
4704,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"The hours, and sat the palace-gates before"
4705,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,On hides of oxen which themselves did slay--
4706,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Haughty of mien they sat, and girt with proud array.”"
4707,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4708,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"As the young prince sits thus, an unwilling host in his father’s hall,"
4709,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"meditating, says the poet, whether or no some day that father may return"
4710,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"suddenly and take vengeance on these invaders of his rights, against"
4711,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"whom he himself seems powerless, he lifts his eyes and sees a stranger"
4712,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,standing at the gate. With simple and high-bred courtesy--the courtesy
4713,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of the old Bible patriarchs, and even now practised by the Orientals,"
4714,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,though the march of modern civilisation has left little remnant of it in
4715,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"our western isles--he hastes to bid the stranger welcome, on the simple"
4716,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"ground that he is a stranger, and will hear no word of his errand until"
4717,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,the rights of hospitality have been paid. Eager as he is to hear
4718,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"possible news of his father, he restrains his anxiety to question his"
4719,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"guest. Not until the handmaidens have brought water in the silver ewers,"
4720,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"and the herald, and the carver, and the dame of the pantry (it is a"
4721,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"right royal establishment, if somewhat rude) have each done their office"
4722,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"to supply the stranger’s wants, does Telemachus ask him a single"
4723,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"question. But when the suitors have ended their feast, they call for"
4724,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"music and song. They compel Phemius, the household bard, to make mirth"
4725,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"for them. Then, while he plies his voice and lyre for their"
4726,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"entertainment, the son of Ulysses whispers aside with his visitor. Who"
4727,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"is he, and whence does he come? Is he a friend of his father’s? For many"
4728,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"a guest, and none unwelcome, had come to those halls, as the son well"
4729,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"knows, in _his_ day. Above all, does he bring news of _him_? Then the"
4730,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"disguised goddess tells her story, with a circumstantial minuteness of"
4731,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,invention which befits wisdom when she condescends to falsehood:--
4732,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4733,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“Know, my name is hight"
4734,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Mentes, the son of brave Anchialus,"
4735,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,And sea-famed Taphos is my regal right;
4736,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,And with my comrades am I come to-night
4737,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Hither, in sailing o’er the wine-dark sea"
4738,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"To men far off, who stranger tongues indite."
4739,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"For copper am I bound to Temesè,"
4740,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,And in my bark I bring sword-steel along with me.
4741,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4742,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“Moored is my ship beyond the city walls,"
4743,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Under the wooded cape, within the bay."
4744,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"We twain do boast, each in the other’s halls,"
4745,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Our fathers’ friendship from an ancient day.
4746,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Hero Laertes ask, and he will say.”"
4747,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4748,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,But of Ulysses’ present fate the guest declares he knows nothing; only
4749,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,he has a presentiment that he is detained somewhere in an unwilling
4750,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"captivity, but that, “though he be bound with chains of iron,” he will"
4751,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"surely find his way home again. But in any case, as his father’s friend,"
4752,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"the supposed Mentes bids Telemachus take heart and courage, and act"
4753,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,manfully for himself. Let him give this train of riotous suitors fair
4754,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"warning to quit the palace, and waste his substance no more; let his"
4755,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,mother Penelope go back to her own father’s house (if she desires to wed
4756,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"again), and make her choice and hold her wedding-banquet there; and for"
4757,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"his own part, let him at once set sail and make inquiry for his father"
4758,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"round the coasts of Greece. It may be that Nestor of Pylos, or Menelaus"
4759,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,of Sparta--the last returned of the chiefs of the expedition--can give
4760,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"him some tidings. If he can only hear that Ulysses is yet alive, then he"
4761,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,may well endure to wait his return with patience; if assured of his
4762,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"death, it will befit him to take due vengeance on these his enemies. The"
4763,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,divine visitor even hints a reproach of Telemachus’ present
4764,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,inactivity:--
4765,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4766,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“No more, with thews like these, to weakness cling."
4767,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Hast thou not heard divine Orestes’ fame,"
4768,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Who slew the secret slayer of the king
4769,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"His father, and achieved a noble name?"
4770,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Thou also, friend, to thine own strength lay claim--"
4771,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Comely thou art and tall--that men may speak
4772,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Thy prowess, and their children speak the same.”"
4773,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4774,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"The young prince duteously accepts the counsel, as from his father’s"
4775,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"friend, and prays his guest to tarry a while. But Minerva, her mission"
4776,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"accomplished, suddenly changes her shape, spreads wings, and vanishes."
4777,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Then Telemachus recognises the goddess, and feels a new life and"
4778,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,spirit born within him. If we choose to admit an allegorical
4779,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"interpretation--more than commonly tempting, as must be confessed, in"
4780,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,this particular case--it is the advent of Wisdom and Discretion to the
4781,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"conscious heart of the youth, hitherto too little awakened to its"
4782,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,responsibilities.
4783,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4784,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Telemachus returns to his place among the revellers a new man. They are
4785,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"still listening to the minstrel, Phemius, who chants a lay of the return"
4786,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of the Greek chiefs from Troy, and the sufferings inflicted on them"
4787,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,during their homeward voyage by the vengeance of the gods. The sound
4788,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"reaches Penelope where she sits apart with her wise maidens, like the"
4789,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"mother of Sisera, in her “upper chamber”--the “bower” of the ladies of"
4790,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"mediæval chivalry. She comes down the stair, and stands on the threshold"
4791,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of the banqueting-hall, attracted by the song. But the subject is too"
4792,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"painful. She calls the bard to her, and begs him, for her sake, to"
4793,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,choose some other theme. We must not be too angry with Telemachus
4794,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"because, in the first flush of his newly-awakened sense of the"
4795,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"responsibilities of his position, he uses language, in addressing his"
4796,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"mother, which to our ears has a sound of harshness and reproach. He bids"
4797,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,her not presume to set limits to the inspiration of the bard--the
4798,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,noblest theme is ever the best. He reminds her that woman’s kingdom is
4799,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"the loom and the distaff, and that the rule over men in his father’s"
4800,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,house now belongs to him. Viewed with reference to the tone of the age
4801,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"as regarded the duties of women,--compared with the parting charge of"
4802,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Hector in the Iliad to the wife he loved so tenderly, and even with a"
4803,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"higher example in Scripture,--there is nothing startling or repulsive in"
4804,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,such language from a son to his mother. To the young prince in his new
4805,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"mood, while the counsels of Minerva were yet ringing in his ears, the"
4806,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,absence and the sufferings of his father might well seem the only theme
4807,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"on which he could endure to hear the minstrel descant; it was of this,"
4808,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"he feels, that he needed to be continually reminded. And if hitherto he"
4809,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"has allowed this riotous company to assume that, in the absence of"
4810,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Ulysses, the government of his house has rested in the weak hands of a"
4811,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"woman, it shall be so no longer. He will take his father’s place."
4812,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4813,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,The mother sees the change in her son’s temper with some surprise--we
4814,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"may suppose, with somewhat mingled feelings of approval and"
4815,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,mortification. The boy has grown into a man on the sudden. The poet
4816,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,gives us but a single word as any clue to the effect upon Penelope of
4817,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,this evidently unaccustomed outburst of self-assertion on the part of
4818,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Telemachus. “Astonished,” he says, she withdraws at once to her upper"
4819,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"chamber, and there weeps her sorrows to sleep. Telemachus himself"
4820,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,addresses the assembled company in a tone which is evidently as new to
4821,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"their ears as to those of his mother. He bids them, with a haughty"
4822,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"courtesy, feast their fill to-night; to-morrow he will summon (as is the"
4823,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"custom of the Homeric princes) a council of the heads of the people, and"
4824,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"there he will give them all public warning to quit his father’s house,"
4825,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"and feast--if they needs must feast--in each other’s houses, at their"
4826,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"own cost. If they refuse, and still make this riot of an absent man’s"
4827,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"wealth, he appeals from men to “the gods who live for ever” for a sure"
4828,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and speedy vengeance.
4829,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4830,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,The careless revellers mark the change in the young man as instantly as
4831,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Penelope. For a few moments they bite their lips in silence--“wondering
4832,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"that he spake so bold.” The first to answer him is Antinous, the most"
4833,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,prominent ringleader of the confraternity of suitors. His character is
4834,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,very like that of the worst stamp of the “Cavalier” of the days of our
4835,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"own Charles II. Brave, bold, and insolent, there is yet a reckless"
4836,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,gaiety and a ready wit about him which would have made him at once a
4837,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,favourite in that unprincipled court. He adds to these characteristics a
4838,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"quality of which he might, unhappily, have also found a high example"
4839,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,there--that of ingratitude. He is bound by strong ties of obligation to
4840,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,the house of Ulysses; his father had come in former days to seek an
4841,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"asylum with the Chief of Ithaca from the vengeance of the Thesprotians,"
4842,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and had been kindly entertained by him until his death. The son now
4843,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,answers Telemachus with a taunting compliment upon the new character in
4844,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,which he has just come out. “He means to claim for himself the
4845,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"sovereignty of the island, as his father’s heir, no doubt; but the gods"
4846,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,forbid that Ithaca should ever come under the rule of so fierce a
4847,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,despot!” Telemachus makes answer that he will at all events rule his
4848,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"father’s house. Upon this, Eurynomus, another leading spirit among the"
4849,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,rivals--a smoother-tongued and more cautious individual--soothes the
4850,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"angry youth with what seems a plausible recognition of his rights, in"
4851,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,order that he may get an answer to a question on which he feels an
4852,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"interest not unmixed, as we may easily understand, with some secret"
4853,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,apprehension. “Who was this traveller from over sea? and--did he happen
4854,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,to bring any news of Ulysses?” But Telemachus has learnt subtlety as
4855,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,well as wisdom from the disguised goddess. He gives the name assumed by
4856,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"his visitor, Mentes, an old friend of the house. But as to his father’s"
4857,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"return, the oracles of the gods and the reports of men all agree in"
4858,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,pronouncing it to have now become hopeless. So the revel is renewed till
4859,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,nightfall; and while the feasters go off to their own quarters somewhere
4860,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"near at hand, Telemachus retires to his chamber (separate, apparently,"
4861,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"from the main building), where his old nurse Eurycleia tends him with a"
4862,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"careful affection, as though he were still a child, folding and hanging"
4863,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"up the vest of fine linen which he takes off when he lies down to sleep,"
4864,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and drawing the bolt of the chamber door through its silver ring when
4865,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,she leaves him.
4866,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4867,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,The council of notables is summoned for the morrow. No such meeting has
4868,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,been held since the departure of Ulysses for Troy. As Telemachus passes
4869,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"to take his place there, all men remark a new majesty in his looks."
4870,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4871,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“So when the concourse to the full was grown,"
4872,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"He lifted in his hand the steely spear,"
4873,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"And to the council moved, but not alone,"
4874,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,For as he walked his swift dogs followed near.
4875,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Also Minerva did with grace endear
4876,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"His form, that all the people gazed intent"
4877,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"And wondered, while he passed without a peer."
4878,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Straight to his father’s seat his course he bent,"
4879,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,And the old men gave way in reverence as he went.”
4880,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4881,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,He makes his passionate protest before them all against the insufferable
4882,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"waste of his household by this crew of revellers, and against their own"
4883,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,supineness in offering him no aid to dislodge them. Antinous rises to
4884,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"answer him, beginning, as before, with an ironical compliment--“the"
4885,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"young orator’s language is as sublime as his spirit.” But the fault, he"
4886,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"begs to assure him, lies not with the suitors, but with the queen"
4887,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"herself. She has been playing fast and loose with her lovers, deluding"
4888,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"them, for these three years past, with vain hopes and false promises."
4889,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"She had, indeed, been practising a kind of pious fraud upon them. She"
4890,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"had set up a mighty loom, in which she wrought diligently to complete,"
4891,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"as she professed, a winding-sheet of delicate texture for her husband’s"
4892,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"father, the aged Laertes, against the day of his death. Not until this"
4893,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"sad task was finished, she entreated of them, let her be asked to choose"
4894,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,a new bridegroom. To so much forbearance they had all assented; but lo!
4895,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,they had lately discovered that what she wrought by day she carefully
4896,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"unwound by night, so that the task promised to be an endless one. Some"
4897,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of the handmaidens (who had found their own lovers, too, amongst their"
4898,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,royal mistress’s many suitors) had betrayed her secret. Antinous is
4899,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,gallant enough to add to this recital of Penelope’s craft warm praises
4900,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of the queen herself, even giving her full credit for the bright woman’s"
4901,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,wit which had so long baffled them all.
4902,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4903,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,“Matchless skill
4904,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"To weave the splendid web; sagacious thought,"
4905,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,And shrewdness such as never fame ascribed
4906,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"To any beauteous Greek of ancient days,"
4907,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Tyro, Mycene, or Alcmene, loved"
4908,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Of Jove himself, all whom th’ accomplished queen"
4909,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Transcends in knowledge--ignorant alone
4910,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"That, wooed long time, she should at last be won.”--(Cowper.)"
4911,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4912,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"But they will now be put off no longer--she must make her choice, or"
4913,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,they will never leave the house so long as she remains there unespoused.
4914,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Telemachus indignantly refuses to send his mother home to her father;
4915,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and repeats his passionate appeal to the gods for vengeance against the
4916,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,wrongs which he is himself helpless to deal with. At once an omen from
4917,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,heaven seems to betoken that the appeal is heard and accepted. Two
4918,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,eagles are seen flying over the heads of the crowd assembled in the
4919,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"marketplace, where they suddenly wheel round, and tear each other"
4920,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,furiously with beak and talons. The soothsayer is at hand to interpret;
4921,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"the aged Halitherses, who reminds them all how he had foretold, when"
4922,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Ulysses first left his own shores for Troy, the twenty years that would"
4923,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"elapse before his return. Now, he sees by this portent, the happy day"
4924,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"is near at hand; nay, in his zeal for his master’s house he goes so far"
4925,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,as to urge the assembled people to take upon themselves at once the
4926,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,punishment of these traitors. One of the suitors mocks at the old man’s
4927,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"auguries, and threatens him for his interference. The prophet is"
4928,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"silenced; and Telemachus, finding no support from the assembly, asks but"
4929,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"for a ship and crew to be furnished him, that he may set forth in search"
4930,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"of his father. One indignant voice, among the apathetic crowd, is raised"
4931,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"in the young prince’s defence: it is that of Mentor, to whom Ulysses had"
4932,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,intrusted the guardianship of his rights in his absence. His name has
4933,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"passed into a synonym for all prudent guardians and moral counsellors,"
4934,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"chiefly in consequence of Fénélon’s didactic tale of ‘Télémaque,’"
4935,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"already mentioned, in which the adventures of the son of Ulysses were"
4936,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“improved,” with elaborate morals, for the benefit of youth; and in"
4937,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"which Mentor, as the young prince’s travelling tutor, played a"
4938,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,conspicuous part. He vents his indignation here in a very striking
4939,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,protest against popular ingratitude:--
4940,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4941,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"“Hear me, ye Ithacans;--be never king"
4942,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"From this time forth benevolent, humane,"
4943,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Or righteous; but let every sceptred hand
4944,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone;"
4945,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Since none of all his people, whom he swayed"
4946,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"With such paternal gentleness and love,"
4947,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Remembers the divine Ulysses more.”--(Cowper.)
4948,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4949,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"He, too, meets with jeers and mockery from the insolent nobles, and"
4950,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Telemachus quits the assembly to wander in melancholy mood along the
4951,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"sea-shore--the usual resort, it will be remarked, of the Homeric"
4952,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"heroes, when they seek to calm the tumult of grief or anger. Such appeal"
4953,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,to the soothing influence of what Homer calls the “illimitable” ocean is
4954,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,not less true to nature than it is characteristic of the poetical and
4955,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"imaginative temperament. Bathing his hands in the sea waves--for prayer,"
4956,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"to the Greek as to the Hebrew mind, demanded a preparatory"
4957,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"purification--Telemachus lifts his cry to his guardian goddess, Minerva."
4958,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,At once she stands before him there in the likeness of Mentor. She
4959,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,speaks to him words of encouragement and counsel. Evil men may mock at
4960,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,him now; but if he be determined to prove himself the true son of such a
4961,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"father, he shall not lack honour in the end. She will provide him ship"
4962,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,and crew for his voyage. Thus encouraged by the divine Wisdom which
4963,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"speaks in the person of Mentor, he returns to the banquet-hall, to avoid"
4964,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"suspicion. Yet, when Antinous greets him there with a mocking show of"
4965,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"friendship, he wrenches his hand roughly from his grasp, and quits the"
4966,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,company. Taking into his counsels his nurse Eurycleia--who is the palace
4967,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,housekeeper also--he bids her make ready good store of provisions for
4968,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"his voyage: twelve capacious vessels filled with the ripest wine, twenty"
4969,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"measures of fine meal, and grain besides, carefully sewn up in wallets."
4970,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"In the dusk of this very evening, unknown to his mother, he will embark;"
4971,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,for the goddess (still in Mentor’s likeness) has chartered for him a
4972,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"galley with twenty stout rowers, which is to lie ready launched for him"
4973,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,in the harbour at nightfall. Eurycleia vainly remonstrates with her
4974,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,nursling on his dangerous purpose--
4975,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4976,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,“‘Ah! bide with thine own people here at ease.
4977,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"There is no call to suffer useless pain,"
4978,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Wandering always on the barren seas.’
4979,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"But he: ‘Good nurse, prithee take heart again,"
4980,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,These things are not without a god nor vain.
4981,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Swear only that my mother shall not know
4982,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Till twelve days pass, or she herself be fain"
4983,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"To ask thee, or some other the tidings show,"
4984,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Lest her salt tears despoil much loveliness with woe.’”
4985,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4986,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Telemachus’s resolve is fixed. As soon as the shadows of evening fall,"
4987,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Minerva sends a strange drowsiness on the assembled revellers in the
4988,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"hall of Ulysses, so that the wine-cups drop from their hands, and they"
4989,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"stagger off early to their couches. Then, in the person of Mentor, she"
4990,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"summons Telemachus to where the galley lies waiting for him, guides him"
4991,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"on board, and takes her place beside him in the stern."
4992,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,
4993,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,“Loud and clear
4994,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Sang the bluff Zephyr o’er the wine-dark mere

4996,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Telemachus his comrades on did cheer
4997,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,To set the tackling. With good hearts the crew
4998,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Heard him, and all things ranged in goodly order true."
4999,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,

5003,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,Loudly the keel rushed through the seething tide.
5004,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"Soon as the good ship’s gear was all applied,"
5005,PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.,"They ranged forth bowls crowned with dark wine, and poured"

5018,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Hitherto, and throughout the first four books of the poem, Telemachus,"
5019,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"and not Ulysses, is the hero of the tale. The voyagers soon reach the"
5020,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"rocky shores of Pylos,[29] the stronghold of the old “horse-tamer,”"
5021,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Nestor. He has survived the long campaign in which so many of his
5022,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"younger comrades fell, and is now sitting, surrounded by his sons, at a"
5023,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"great public banquet held in honour of the Sea-god. Telemachus, with a"
5024,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"natural modesty not unbecoming his youth, is at first reluctant to"
5025,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"accost and question a chieftain so full of years and renown, and his"
5026,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,attendant guardian has to reassure him by the promise that “heaven will
5027,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"put words into his mouth.” There is no need of question yet, however,"
5028,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"either on the side of hosts or guests. Pisistratus, the youngest son of"
5029,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Nestor, upon whom the duties of “guest-master” naturally fall, welcomes"
5030,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,the travellers with the invariable courtesy accorded by the laws of
5031,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Homeric society to all strangers as their right, bids them take a seat"
5032,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"at the banquet, and proffers the wine-cup--to the supposed Mentor"
5033,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"first, as the elder. He only requests of them, before they drink, to"
5034,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,join their hosts in their public supplication to Neptune; for he will
5035,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,not do them the injustice to suppose prayer can be unknown or
5036,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"distasteful to them, be they who they may--“All men have need of"
5037,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,prayer.” When the prayer has been duly made by both for a blessing on
5038,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"their hosts and for their own safe return, and when they have eaten and"
5039,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"drunk to their hearts’ content, then, and not till then, Nestor inquires"
5040,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,their errand. The form in which the old chief put his question is as
5041,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,strongly characteristic of a primitive civilisation as the open
5042,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"hospitality which has preceded it. He asks the voyagers, in so many"
5043,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"words, whether they are pirates?--not for a moment implying that such an"
5044,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,occupation would be to their discredit. The freebooters of the sea in
5045,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the Homeric times were dangerous enough, but not disreputable. It was an"
5046,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"iron age, when every man’s hand was more or less against his neighbour,"
5047,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,and the guest of to-day might be an enemy to-morrow. Nestor’s downright
5048,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,question may help a modern reader to understand the waste of Ulysses’
5049,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,substance in his absence by the lawless spirits of Ithaca. It was only
5050,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,so long as “the strong man armed kept his palace” in person that his
5051,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"goods were in peace. Telemachus, in reply, declares his name and errand,"
5052,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"and implores the old chieftain, in remembrance of the days when he and"
5053,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Ulysses fought side by side at Troy, to give him, if he can, some"
5054,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,tidings of his father.

5069,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5070,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Nestor shows the same love of story-telling which marks his character in
5071,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,the Iliad. Modern critics who are inclined to accuse the old chief of
5072,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"garrulity should remember that, in an age in which there were no daily"
5073,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"newspapers with their “special correspondents,” a good memory and a"
5074,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,fluent tongue were very desirable qualifications of old age. The old
5075,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,campaigner in his retirement was the historian of his own times. Unless
5076,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,he told his story often and at length amongst the men of a younger
5077,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"generation when they met at the banquet, all memory of the gallant deeds"
5078,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"of old would be lost, and even the professional bard would have lacked"
5079,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,the data on which to build his lay. Many a Nestor must have been
5080,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,ready--in season and out of season--to
5081,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5082,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"“Shoulder his crutch, and show how fields were won,”"
5083,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5084,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"before any Homer could have sung of the Trojan war. Even now, we are"
5085,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,ready to listen readily to the veteran’s reminiscences of a past
5086,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"generation, whether in war or peace, who has a retentive memory and a"
5087,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,pleasant style--only he now commonly tells his story in print.
5088,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5089,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Nestor proceeds to tell his guests how the gods, after Troy was taken,"
5090,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,had stirred up strife between the brother-kings Agamemnon and Menelaus;
5091,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"and how, in consequence, the fleet had divided, Menelaus with one"
5092,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"division sailing straight for home, while the rest had waited with"
5093,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Agamemnon in the hope of appeasing the wrath of heaven. Ulysses, who had"
5094,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"at first set sail with Menelaus, had turned back and rejoined his"
5095,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,leader. Of his subsequent fate Nestor knows nothing; but he bids the
5096,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,young man take courage. He has heard of the troubles that beset him at
5097,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,home; but if Minerva vouchsafes to the son the love and favour which (as
5098,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"was known to all the Greeks) she bore to his father, all will go well"
5099,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,with him yet. Neither Nestor nor Telemachus are aware (though the reader
5100,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,is) that the Wisdom which had made Ulysses a great name was even now
5101,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,guiding the steps of his son. One thing yet the youth longs to hear from
5102,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,the lips of his father’s ancient friend--the terrible story of
5103,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Agamemnon’s death by the hands of his wife and her paramour, and the"
5104,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,vengeance taken by his son Orestes. It is a tale which he has heard as
5105,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"yet but darkly, but has dwelt upon in his heart ever since the goddess,"
5106,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"at her visit under the shape of Mentes, made such significant reference"
5107,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"to the story. Nestor tells it now at length--the bloody legend which,"
5108,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"variously shaped, became the theme of the poet and the dramatist from"
5109,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,generation to generation of Greek literature. In Homer’s version we miss
5110,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,some of the horrors which later writers wove into the tale; and it is
5111,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"not unlikely that, in the simpler form in which it is here given, we"
5112,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,have the main facts of an actual domestic tragedy. During Agamemnon’s
5113,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"long absence in the Trojan war, his queen Clytemnestra, sister of"
5114,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Helen, had been seduced from her marriage faith by her husband’s cousin"
5115,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Ægisthus. In vain had the household bard, faithful to the trust"
5116,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"committed to him by his lord in his absence, counselled and warned his"
5117,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"lady against the peril; and Ægisthus at last, hopeless of his object so"
5118,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"long as she had these honest eyes upon her, had caused him to be carried"
5119,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"to a desert island to perish with hunger. So she fell, and Ægisthus"
5120,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,ruled palace and kingdom. At last Agamemnon returned from the weary
5121,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"siege, and, landing on the shore of his kingdom, knelt down and kissed"
5122,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,the soil in a transport of joyful tears. It is probably with no
5123,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"conscious imitation, but merely from the correspondence of the poet’s"
5124,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"mind, that Shakespeare attributes the very same expression of feeling to"
5125,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,his Richard II.:--
5126,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5127,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,“I weep for joy

5135,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5136,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Agamemnon meets with as tragical a reception from the usurper of his

5162,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"shadow still thrown over Agamemnon’s death by later poets, which finds"

5170,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,their vessel and continue their quest; but the old chieftain will not
5171,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"hear of it. That night, at least, they must remain as his guests--on the"
5172,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"morrow he will send them on to the court of Menelaus at Sparta, where"
5173,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,they may chance to learn the latest tidings of Ulysses. Telemachus’s
5174,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"guardian bids him accept the invitation, then suddenly spreads wings,"
5175,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,and takes to flight in the likeness of a sea-eagle; and both Nestor and
5176,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Telemachus recognise at last that, in the shape of Mentor, the goddess"
5177,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,of wisdom has been so long his guide. A sacrifice is forthwith offered
5178,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"in her honour--a heifer, with horns overlaid with gold; a public banquet"
5179,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"is held as before, and then, according to promise, Telemachus is sped on"
5180,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,his journey. A pair of swift and strong-limbed horses--the old chief
5181,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"knew what a good horse was, and charged his sons specially to take the"
5182,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"best in his stalls--are harnessed for the journey, and good provision of"
5183,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"corn and wine, “such as was fit for princes,” stored in the chariot."
5184,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Pisistratus himself mounts beside his new friend as driver. Their first
5185,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"day’s stage is Pheræ, where they are hospitably entertained by Nestor’s"
5186,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"friend, Diocles; and, after driving all the following day, they reach"
5187,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the palace gates of Menelaus, in Sparta, when the sun has set upon the"
5188,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"yellow harvest fields, “and all the ways are dim.”"

5190,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"At Sparta, too, as at Pylos, the city is holding high festival on the"
5191,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,evening of their arrival. A double marriage is being celebrated in the
5192,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"halls of Menelaus. Hermione, his sole child by Helen, is leaving her"
5193,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"parents to become the bride of Neoptolemus (otherwise known as Pyrrhus,"
5194,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the “red-haired”), son of the great Achilles; and at the same time the"
5195,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"young Megapenthes, Menelaus’s son by a slave wife, is to be married in"
5196,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,his father’s house. There is music and dancing in the halls when the
5197,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"travellers arrive; but Menelaus, like Nestor, will ask no questions of"
5198,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the strangers until the bath, and food, and wine in plenty, have"
5199,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"refreshed them, and their horses have good barley-meal and rye set"
5200,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"before them in the mangers. The magnificence of Menelaus’s palace, as"
5201,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"described by the poet, is a very remarkable feature in the tale. It"
5202,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,reads far more like a scene from the ‘Arabian Nights’ than a lay of
5203,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,early Greece. The lofty roofs fling back a flashing light as the
5204,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"travellers enter, “like as the splendour of the sun or moon.” Gold,"
5205,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"silver, bronze, ivory, and electrum, combine their brilliancy in the"
5206,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"decorations. The guests wash in lavers of silver, and the water is"
5207,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"poured from golden ewers. Telemachus is struck with wonder at the sight,"
5208,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,and can compare it to nothing earthly.

5210,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,“Such and so glorious to celestial eyne

5213,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"The palaces of Sparta, as seen in Homer’s vision, contrast remarkably"
5214,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,with the estimate formed of them by the Greek historian of a later age.
5215,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Thucydides speaks of the city as having no public buildings of any
5216,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"magnificence, such as would impress a stranger with an idea of its real"
5217,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"power, but wearing rather the appearance of a collection of villages. It"
5218,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,is difficult to conceive that the actual Sparta of a much earlier age
5219,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,could have contained anything at all corresponding to this Homeric ideal
5220,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"of splendour; and the question arises, whether we have here an"
5221,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"indistinct record of an earlier and extinct civilisation, or whether the"
5222,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,poet drew an imaginary description from his own recollections of the
5223,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"gorgeous barbaric splendour of some city in the further East, which he"
5224,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,had visited in his travels. If this be nothing more than a poet’s
5225,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,exaggerated and idealised view of an actual state of higher
5226,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"civilisation, which once really existed in the old Greek kingdoms, and"
5227,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"disappeared under the Dorian Heraclids, it is a singular record of a"
5228,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,backward step in a nation’s history; and the Homeric poems become
5229,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,especially valuable as preserving the memorials of a state of society
5230,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,which would otherwise have passed altogether into oblivion. There is
5231,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,less difficulty in believing the possible existence of an
5232,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"ante-historical civilisation which afterwards became extinct, if we"
5233,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"remember the splendours of Solomon’s court, as to which the widespread"
5234,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"traditions of the East only corroborate the records of Scripture, and"
5235,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,all which passed away almost entirely with its founder. It is remarkable
5236,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"that in the ancient Welsh poem, ‘Y Gododin,’ by Aneurin Owen, of which"
5237,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the supposed date is A.D. 570, there are very similar properties and"
5238,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"scenery: knights in “armour of gold” and “purple plumes,” mounted on"
5239,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"“thick-maned chargers,” with “golden spurs,” who must--if ever they rode"
5240,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,the Cambrian mountains--have been a very different race from the wild
5241,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Welsh who held Edward Longshanks at bay. Are we to look upon this as
5242,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"merely the common language of all poets? and, if so, how comes it to be"
5243,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,common to all? Were the Welsh who fought in the half-mythical battle of
5244,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Cattraeth as far superior, in the scale of civilisation, to their"
5245,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"successors who fell at Conway, as the Spartans under Menelaus (if"
5246,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Homer’s picture of them is to be trusted) were to the Spartans under
5247,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Leonidas? or was there some remote original, Oriental or other, whence"
5248,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,this ornate military imagery passed into the poetry of such very
5249,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,different nations?
5250,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5251,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"So, too, when Helen--now restored to her place in Menelaus’s"
5252,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"household--comes forth to greet the strangers, her whole surroundings"
5253,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,are rather those of an Eastern sultana than of any princess of Spartan

5269,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,fabric of wool tinged with the costly purple dye--have little in common
5270,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"with the household loom of Penelope. Here, as in the Iliad, refinement"
5271,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,and elegance of taste are the distinctive characteristics of Helen; and
5272,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"they help to explain, though they in no way excuse, the fascination"
5273,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"exercised over her by Paris, the accomplished musician and brilliant"
5274,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"converser, rich in all the graces which Venus, for her own evil"
5275,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"purposes, had bestowed on her favourite. Helen is still, as in the"
5276,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Iliad, emphatically “the lady;” the lady of rank and fashion, as things"
5277,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"were in that day, with all the fashionable faults, and all the"
5278,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"fashionable good qualities: selfish, and luxurious, gracious and"
5279,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"fascinating. Her transgressions, and the seemingly lenient view which"
5280,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the poet takes of them, have been discussed sufficiently in the Iliad."
5281,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,They are all now condoned. She has recovered from her miserable
5282,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,infatuation; and if we are inclined to despise Menelaus for his easy
5283,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"temper as a husband, we must remember the mediæval legends of Arthur and"
5284,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Guinevere, to whom Helen bears, in many points of character, a strong"
5285,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,resemblance. The readiness which Arthur shows to have accepted at any
5286,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"time the repentance of his queen is almost repulsive to modern feeling,"
5287,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,but was evidently not so to the taste of the age in which those legends
5288,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,were popular; nor is it at all clear that such forgiveness is less
5289,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,consonant with the purest code of morality than the stern implacability
5290,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,towards such offences which the laws of modern society would enjoin.
5291,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Menelaus has forgiven Helen, even as Arthur--though not Mr Tennyson’s"
5292,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Arthur--would have forgiven Guinevere. But she has not forgiven herself,"
5293,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,and this is a strong redeeming point in her character; “shameless” is
5294,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"still the uncompromising epithet which she applies to herself, as in the"

5327,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,that Helen enters the hall. Her quick thought seizes the truth at once;
5328,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,as she had detected the father through his disguise of rags when he came
5329,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"as a spy into Troy, so now she recognises the son at once by his strong"
5330,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"personal resemblance. Then Menelaus, too, sees the likeness, and"
5331,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,connects it with the youth’s late emotion. Young Pisistratus at once
5332,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"tells him who his friend is, and on what errand they are travelling"

5376,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,some of his comrades had disguised themselves in seal-skins[31] (though
5377,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"much disturbed, as he confesses, by the “very ancient and fish-like"
5378,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"smell”), and had seized the ancient sea-god as he lay asleep on the"

5433,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"which waits for him at Pylos. His host reluctantly dismisses him, not"
5434,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,without parting gifts; but the gift which the king would have had him
5435,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,take--a chariot and yoke of three swift horses--the island-prince will
5436,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"not accept. Ithaca has no room for horse-coursing, and he loves his"

5445,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,
5446,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,There is much consternation in the palace of Ulysses when the absence of
5447,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,Telemachus is at last discovered. Antinous and his fellow-revellers are
5448,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"struck with astonishment at the bold step he has suddenly taken, and"
5449,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"with alarm at the possible result. Antinous will man a vessel at once,"
5450,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,and waylay him in the straits on his return. The revelation of this plot
5451,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"to Penelope by Medon, the herald, one of the few faithful retainers of"
5452,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"Ulysses’ house, makes her for the first time aware of her son’s"
5453,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,departure; for old Eurycleia has kept her darling’s secret safe even
5454,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,from his mother. In an agony of grief she sits down amidst her
5455,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"sympathising maidens, and bewails herself as “twice bereaved,” of son"
5456,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"and husband. She lifts her prayer to Minerva, and the goddess hears."

5458,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"couch what seems the form of her sister Iphthimè, and assures her of her"
5459,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,son’s safety: he has a guardian about his path “such as many a hero
5460,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"would pray to have.” Even in her dream, Penelope is half conscious of"
5461,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the dignity of her visitor; and, true wife that she is, she prays the"
5462,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"vision to tell her something of her absent husband. But such revelation,"
5463,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,"the figure tells her, is no part of its mission, and so vanishes into"
5464,TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.,thin air. The sleeper awakes--it is a dream indeed; but it has left a

5480,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"mortals, but their dissensions are neither so passionate nor so"

5483,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"long an exile from his home. She, too, repeats the indignant protest"

5486,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,the bitterness of a wounded spirit men rebel against what seems the
5487,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,inequality of the justice of heaven; that “there is one event to the
5488,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"righteous and the wicked;” nay, that the wicked have even the best of"
5489,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,it. “Let never king henceforth do justly and love mercy; but let him
5490,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,rule with iron hand and work all iniquity; for lo! what is Ulysses’
5491,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,reward?” Jupiter is moved by the appeal. He at once despatches Mercury
5492,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"to the island of Calypso, to announce to her that Ulysses must be"
5493,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"released from her toils; such is his sovereign will, and it must be"
5494,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,obeyed. The description of the island-grotto in which Calypso dwells is
5495,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"one of the most beautiful in Homer, and it is a passage upon which our"

5505,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"A smell of cedar and of citron wood,"

5507,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"And she within sat spinning all the while,"
5508,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,And sang a low sweet song that made him hark and smile.

5542,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"especially with those of Arthur and his Round Table, has been already"

5544,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Homer is far purer. But there is one bright creation of mediæval fiction
5545,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,which finds no counterpart in the song of the Greek bard. It was only
5546,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Christianity--one might almost say it was only mediæval
5547,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Christianity--which could conceive the pure ideal of the stainless

5557,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“Child of Laertes, wouldst thou fain depart"

5566,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5567,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Ulysses’ reply is honest and manful:--
5568,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5569,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,“All this I know and do myself avow.
5570,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Well may Penelope in form and brow

5575,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5576,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,“But if some god amid the wine-dark flood
5577,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"With doom pursue me, and my vessel mar,"
5578,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Then will I bear it as a brave man should.

5581,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5582,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"It cannot but be observed, however, that while Penelope’s whole thoughts"
5583,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"and interests are concentrated upon her absent husband, the longing of"
5584,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Ulysses is rather after his fatherland than his wife. She is only one of
5585,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,the many component parts of the home-scene which is ever before the
5586,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"wanderer’s eyes; and not always the most important part, for his aged"
5587,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,father and mother and his young son seem to be at least equal objects
5588,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,of anxiety. It may be urged that in this parting scene with Calypso he
5589,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"is purposely reticent in the matter of his affection for Penelope, not"
5590,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,caring to draw down upon himself the proverbial wrath of “a woman
5591,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"scorned;” and that for a similar reason he suppresses his feelings, and"
5592,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"quite ignores the existence of his wife, at the court of Alcinous, when"
5593,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"that king offers him his daughter in marriage. But there is, to say the"
5594,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"least, some lack of enthusiasm on the husband’s part throughout. Of the"
5595,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,single-hearted devotion of woman to man we have striking instances both
5596,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,in Penelope and in the Andromache of the Iliad; but the devotion of man
5597,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,to woman had yet long to wait for its development in the age of
5598,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,chivalry.
5599,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5600,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"He builds himself a boat on the island, by Calypso’s instructions, and"
5601,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"when all is ready, she stores it plentifully with food and wine, and"
5602,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,gives him directions for his voyage. He launches and sets sail; but the
5603,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,angry god of the sea (irate especially against Ulysses for having
5604,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"blinded his son, the giant Polyphemus, as we shall learn hereafter)"
5605,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"stirs winds and waves against him, wrecks his bark, and leaves him"
5606,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"clinging for life to a broken spar. One of the sea-nymphs, Ino, takes"
5607,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"pity on him, and gives him a charmed scarf--so long as he wears it his"
5608,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,life is safe. For two nights and days he is tossed helplessly on the
5609,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"ocean; on the third, with sore wounds and bruises, he makes good his"
5610,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"landing on the rock-bound coast of a strange island. Utterly exhausted,"
5611,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"he scrapes together a bed of leaves, and creeping into it, sinks into a"
5612,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,profound sleep.
5613,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5614,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,He awakes to find himself in a kind of faeryland. The island on which
5615,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"he has been cast is Scheria,[32] inhabited by the Phæacians, whose king"
5616,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,and people are very far indeed from being of the ordinary type of mortal
5617,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"men. Whether the poet, in his description of these Phæacian islanders,"
5618,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"was exercising his imagination only, or indulging his talent for satire,"
5619,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,is a controverted question with Homeric critics. Those who would assign
5620,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,this poem of the Odyssey to a different author from the writer or
5621,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"writers of the Iliad, and to a much later date than that commonly given"
5622,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"to Homer, have thought that in the good-humoured boastfulness of the"
5623,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Phæacian character, their love of pleasure and novelty, and their"
5624,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"attachment to the sea, some Ionian poet was showing up, under fictitious"
5625,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"names, the weaknesses of his own countrymen. Others take the Phæacians"
5626,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"to be only another name for the Phœnicians, the sailors of all seas, who"
5627,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,had probably in their character somewhat of the egotism and exaggeration
5628,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,which have been commonly reputed faults of men who have travelled far
5629,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"and seen much. Whatever may be the true interpretation of the story, or"
5630,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"whether there be any interpretation at all, this curious episode in the"
5631,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,adventures of Ulysses is unquestionably rather comic than serious. The
5632,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"names are all significant, somewhat after the fashion of those assumed"
5633,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"by the Red men. The king (Alcinous) is “Strong-mind,” son of “The Swift"
5634,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Seaman,” and he has a brother called “Crusher of Men.” The nautical"
5635,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"names of his courtiers--“Prow-man” and “Stern-man,” and the rest--are as"
5636,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,palpably conventional as our own Tom Bowline and Captain Crosstree. The
5637,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"hero’s introduction to his new hosts presents, nevertheless, one of the"
5638,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,most beautiful scenes in the poem. The patriarchal simplicity of the
5639,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"tale cannot fail to remind the reader, as Homer so often does, of the"
5640,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,narratives of the earlier Scriptures.
5641,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5642,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"The princess Nausicaa, daughter of the king of the Phæacians, has had a"
5643,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"dream. The dream--which comes as naturally to princesses, no doubt, as"
5644,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,to other young people--is of marriage; and in this case it could be no
5645,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"possible reproach to the dreamer, since the goddess of wisdom is"
5646,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,represented as having herself suggested it. Nor is the dream of any
5647,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"bridegroom in particular, but simply of what seems to us the very"
5648,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"prosaic fact that a wedding outfit, which must soon come to be thought"
5649,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"of, required household stores of good linen; and that the family stock"
5650,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"in the palace, from long disuse, stood much in need of washing. Nausicaa"
5651,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"awakes in the morning, and begs of her father to lend her a chariot and"
5652,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"a yoke of mules, that she and her maidens may go down to the shore,"
5653,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"where the river joins the sea, to perform this domestic duty. The"
5654,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,pastoral simplicity of the whole scene is charming. It has all the
5655,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,freshness of those earlier ages when the business of life was so
5656,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"leisurely and jovially conducted, that much of it wore the features of a"
5657,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"holiday. The princess and her maidens plunge the linen in the stream,"
5658,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,and stamp it clean with their pretty bare feet (a process which will
5659,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"remind an English reader of Arlette and Robert of Normandy, and which"
5660,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"may be seen in operation still at many a burn-side in Scotland), and"
5661,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,then go themselves to bathe. An outdoor banquet forms part of the day’s
5662,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"enjoyment; for the good queen, Nausicaa’s mother, has stored the wain"
5663,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"with delicate viands and a goat-skin of sweet wine. When this is over,"
5664,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the girls begin to play at ball. Ulysses, be it remembered, is all this"
5665,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"while lying fast asleep under his heap of leaves, and, as it happens,"
5666,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,close by the spot where this merry party are disporting themselves. By
5667,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"chance Nausicaa, too eager in her game, throws the ball out into the"
5668,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"sea; whereupon the whole chorus of handmaidens raise a cry of dismay,"
5669,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"which at once awakens the sleeper. He is puzzled, when he comes to"
5670,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"himself, to make out where he is; and still more confounded, when he"
5671,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"peers out from his hiding-place, to find himself in the close"
5672,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"neighbourhood of this bevy of joyous damsels, especially when he"
5673,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,bethinks himself of the very primitive style of his present costume; for
5674,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,the scarf which the sea-nymph gave him us a talisman he had cast into
5675,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the sea upon his landing, as she had especially charged him. But Ulysses"
5676,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,is far too old a traveller to allow an over-punctilious modesty to stand
5677,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,in his way when he is in danger of starving. He has no idea of missing
5678,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,this opportunity of supplying his wants merely because he has lost his
5679,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,wardrobe. He extemporises some very slight covering out of an
5680,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"olive-bough, and, in this strange attire, makes his sudden appearance"
5681,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,before the party. Nausicaa’s maidens all scream and take to flight--very
5682,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"excusably; but the king’s daughter, with a true nobility, stands firm."
5683,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"She sees only a shipwrecked man, and “to the pure all things are pure.”"
5684,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Ulysses is a courtier as well as a traveller, and knows much of “cities"
5685,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"and men;” and it is not the flattery of a suppliant, but the quick"
5686,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"discernment of a man of the world, which makes him at once assign her"
5687,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,true rank to the fair stranger who stands before him. He remains at a
5688,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"respectful distance, while, in the language of Eastern compliment, he"
5689,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"compares her to the young palm-tree for grace and beauty, and invokes"
5690,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the blessing of the gods upon her marriage-hour, if she will take pity"
5691,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"on his miserable case. Nausicaa recalls her fugitive attendants, and"
5692,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"rebukes them for their folly, reminding them that “the stranger and the"
5693,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,poor are the messengers of the gods.” The shipwrecked hero is supplied
5694,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"at once with food and drink and raiment; and when he reappears, after"
5695,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"having bathed and clothed himself, it is with a mien and stature more"
5696,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"majestic than his wont, with the “hyacinthine locks” of immortal youth"
5697,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,flowing round his stately shoulders--such grace does his guardian
5698,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"goddess bestow upon him, that he may find favour in the sight of the"
5699,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Phæacian princess. She looks upon him now with simple and undisguised
5700,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"admiration, confessing aside to her handmaidens that, when her time for"
5701,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"marriage _does_ come, she should wish for just such a husband as this"
5702,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,godlike stranger. There is nothing unmaidenly in such language from the
5703,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"lips of Nausicaa. To remain unmarried was a reproach in her day,"
5704,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"whatever it may be in ours, and a reproach not likely to fall upon a"
5705,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"king’s daughter; so, looking upon the marriage state as inevitable, and"
5706,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"at her age very near at hand, she thinks and speaks of it unreservedly"
5707,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,to her companions. Our modern conventional silence on such topics arises
5708,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,in great degree from the fact that a perpetual maidenhood is the
5709,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"inevitable lot of far too many in our over-civilised society, and, being"
5710,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"inevitable, is no reproach. It does not consort, therefore, with"
5711,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"maidenly dignity to express any interest about marriage, for which an"
5712,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,opportunity may never be offered.
5713,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5714,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"But Nausicaa is at least as careful to observe the proprieties,"
5715,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"according to her own view of them, as any modern young lady. She will"
5716,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,promise the shipwrecked stranger a welcome at her father’s court; but he
5717,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"must by no means ride home in the wain with her, or even be seen"
5718,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,entering the city in her company. So Ulysses runs by the side of her
5719,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"mules, and waits in a sacred grove near the city gates, until the"
5720,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,princess and her party have re-entered the palace. When they have
5721,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"disappeared, he issues forth, and meets a girl carrying a pitcher. It is"
5722,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"once more his guardian goddess in disguise. She veils him in a mist, so"
5723,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,that he passes the streets unquestioned by the natives (who have no love
5724,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"for strangers), and stands at last in the presence of King Alcinous."
5725,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5726,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"The king of the Phæacians, as well as his queen, boast to be descended"
5727,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"from Neptune. His subjects therefore, are, as has been said,"
5728,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,emphatically a seagoing people. Ulysses has already seen with
5729,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"admiration, as he passed,"
5730,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5731,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“The smooth wide havens, and the glorious fleet,"
5732,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Wherewith those mariners the great deep tire.”
5733,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5734,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Their galleys, moreover, are unlike any barks that ever walked the seas"
5735,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,except in a poet’s imagination. King Alcinous himself describes them:--
5736,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5737,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“For unto us no pilots appertain,"
5738,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Rudder nor helm which other barks obey.
5739,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"These, ruled by reason, their own course essay"
5740,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Sharing men’s mind. Cities and climes they know,"
5741,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"And through the deep sea-gorges cleaving way,"
5742,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Wrapt in an ambient vapour, to and fro"
5743,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Sail in a fearless scorn of scathe or overthrow.”
5744,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5745,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,The wondrous art of navigation might well seem nothing less than
5746,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,miraculous in an age when all the forces of nature were personified as
5747,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"gods. So, when the great ship Argo carried out her crew of ancient"
5748,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"heroes on what was the first voyage of discovery, the fable ran that in"
5749,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"her prow was set a beam cut from the oak of Dodona, which had the gift"
5750,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"of speech, and gave the voyagers oracles in their distress. Our English"
5751,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Spenser must have had these Phæacian ships in mind when he describes the
5752,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,“gondelay” which bears the enchantress Phædria:--
5753,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5754,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“Eftsoone her shallow ship away did slide,"
5755,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"More swift than swallow sheres the liquid sky,"
5756,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Withouten oar or pilot it to guide,"
5757,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Or winged canvass with the wind to fly;
5758,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Only she turned a pin, and by-and-by"
5759,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"It cut a way upon the yielding wave,"
5760,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,(Ne cared she her course for to apply)
5761,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"For it was taught the way which she would have,"
5762,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,And both from rocks and flats itself could wisely save.”
5763,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5764,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"As the men of Phæacia excel all others in seamanship, so also do the"
5765,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,women in the feminine accomplishments of weaving and embroidery. But
5766,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"they are not, as they freely confess, a nation of warriors: they love"
5767,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the feast and the dance and the song, and care little for what other men"
5768,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,call glory. The palace of Alcinous and its environs are all in
5769,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,accordance with this luxurious type of character. All round the palace
5770,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"lie gardens and orchards, which rejoice in an enchanted climate, under"
5771,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,whose influence their luscious products ripen in an unfailing
5772,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,succession:--
5773,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5774,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“There in full prime the orchard-trees grow tall,"
5775,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Sweet fig, pomegranate, apple fruited fair,"
5776,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Pear and the healthful olive. Each and all
5777,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Both summer droughts and chills of winter spare;
5778,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,All the year round they flourish. Some the air

5789,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,From the long basement to the topmost height.
5790,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"There on each side ran walls of flaming brass,"
5791,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Zoned on the summit with a blue bright mass
5792,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Of cornice; and the doors were framed of gold;

5802,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"And from the shining threshold thrones were set,"

5804,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"On to the far room, where the women met,"
5805,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,With many a rich robe strewn and woven coverlet.

5814,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Flash like the quivering leaves of aspen tall;
5815,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,And from the close-spun weft the trickling oil will fall.”

5822,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,the poet was satiric or serious--the ruling influence lies with the
5823,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,women. The mist in which Minerva had enveloped his person melts away;
5824,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"and while all gaze in astonishment at his sudden appearance, he claims"
5825,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"hospitality as a shipwrecked wanderer, and then, after the fashion of"
5826,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"suppliants, seats himself on the hearth-stone. The hospitality of"
5827,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Alcinous is prompt and magnificent. He bids one of his sons rise up and
5828,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"cede the place of honour to the stranger. If he be mortal man, the boon"
5829,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"he asks shall be granted; but it may be that he is one of the immortals,"
5830,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"who, as he gravely assures his guest, often condescend to come down and"
5831,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"share the banquets of the Phæacians, and make themselves known to them"
5832,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"face to face. Ulysses assures his royal host, in a passage which is in"
5833,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"itself sufficient to mark the subdued comedy of the episode, that far"
5834,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"from having any claim to divinity, he is very mortal indeed, and wholly"
5835,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,taken up at present with one of the most inglorious of mortal
5836,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,cravings:--
5837,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5838,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“Nothing more shameless is than Appetite,"
5839,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Who still, whatever anguish load our breast,"
5840,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Makes us remember, in our own despite,"
5841,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Both food and drink. Thus I, thrice wretched wight,"
5842,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Carry of inward grief surpassing store,"
5843,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Yet she constrains me with superior might,"
5844,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Wipes clean away the memory-written score,"

5846,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5847,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"There is every appliance to satisfy appetite, however, in the luxurious"

5849,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"careful housewife as she is with all her royalty, marks with some"
5850,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,curiosity that the raiment which their strange guest wears must have
5851,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,come from her own household stores--so well does she know the work of
5852,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,herself and her handmaidens. This leads to a confession on Ulysses’ part
5853,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"of his previous interview with Nausicaa, whom he praises, as he had good"
5854,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"right to do, as wise beyond her years. So charmed is the king with his"
5855,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"guest’s taste and discernment, that he at once declares that nothing"
5856,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,would please him better than to retain him at his court in the
5857,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,character of a son-in-law. Ulysses (whose fate it is throughout his
5858,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,wanderings to make himself only too interesting to the fair sex
5859,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,generally) is by this time too much accustomed to such proposals to show
5860,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,any embarrassment. With his usual diplomacy he puts the question
5861,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"aside--bowing his acknowledgments only, it may be, though Homer does not"
5862,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,tell us even so much as this. The one point to which he addresses
5863,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"himself is the king’s promise to send him safe home, which he accepts"
5864,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"with thankfulness. Before they retire for the night, the queen herself"
5865,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,does not disdain to give special orders for their guest’s accommodation.
5866,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,She bids her maidens prepare
5867,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5868,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“A couch beneath the echoing corridor,"
5869,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"And thereon spread the crimson carpets fair,"
5870,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Then the wide coverlets of richness rare,"
5871,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"And to arrange the blankets warm and white,"
5872,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Wherein who sleepeth straight forgets his care.
5873,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"They then, each holding in her hand a light,"
5874,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"From the great hall pass forth, and spread the robes aright.”"
5875,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5876,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,The combination of magnificence with simplicity is of a wholly Oriental
5877,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,character. The appliances of the court might be those of a modern
5878,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Eastern potentate; yet the queen is a thrifty housekeeper, the"
5879,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"princess-royal superintends the family wash, and the five sons of the"
5880,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"royal family, when their sister comes home, themselves come forward and"
5881,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,unyoke her mules from the wain which has brought home the linen.
5882,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5883,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,The next day is devoted to feasting and games in honour of the stranger.
5884,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Amongst the company sits the blind minstrel Demodocus, in whose person"
5885,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,it has been thought that the poet describes himself--

5892,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Set with the feasters, leaning it with skill"

5894,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Made the blind fingers feel the harp suspended there.”
5895,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5896,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Such honour has the bard in all lands. The king’s son does not disdain
5897,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"to guide “the blind fingers;” and when the song is over, the herald"
5898,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"leads him carefully to his place at the banquet, where his portion is of"
5899,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,the choicest--“the chine of the white-tusked boar.” The subject of his
5900,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"lay is the tale which charms all hearers--Phæacian, Greek, or Roman,"
5901,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"ancient or modern, then as now--the tale of Troy. Touched with the"
5902,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"remembrances which the song awakens, Ulysses wraps his face in his"
5903,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,mantle to hide his rising tears. The king marks his guest’s emotion: too
5904,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"courteous to allude to it, he contents himself with rising at once from"
5905,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the banquet-table, and giving order for the sports to begin. Foot-race,"
5906,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"wrestling, quoit-throwing, and boxing, all have their turn; and in all"
5907,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the king’s’ sons take their part, not unsuccessfully. It is suggested at"
5908,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"last that the stranger, who stands silently looking on, should exhibit"
5909,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,some feat of strength or skill. Ulysses declines--he has no heart just
5910,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"now for pastimes. Then one of the young Phæacians, Euryalus, who has"
5911,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"just won the wrestling-match, gives vent to an ungracious taunt. Their"
5912,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"guest, he says, is plainly no hero, nor versed in the noble science of"
5913,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"athletics; he must be some skipper of a merchantman, “whose talk is all"
5914,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,of cargoes.” He brings down upon himself a grand rebuke from Ulysses:--
5915,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5916,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“Man, thou hast not said well; a fool thou art."
5917,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Not all fair gifts to all doth God divide,"
5918,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Eloquence, beauty, and a noble heart."
5919,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"One seems in mien poor, but his feebler part"
5920,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"God crowns with language, that men learn to love"
5921,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"The form, so feelingly the sweet words dart"
5922,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Within them. First in councils he doth prove,"
5923,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"And, ’mid the crowd observant, like a god doth move."
5924,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5925,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“Another, though in mould of form and face"
5926,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Like the immortal gods he seems to be,"
5927,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Hath no wise word to crown the outward grace
5928,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"So is thine aspect fair exceedingly,"
5929,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Wherein no blemish even a god might see;
5930,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Yet is thine understanding wholly vain.”
5931,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5932,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Then the hero who has thrown the mighty Ajax in the wrestling-ring, who"
5933,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"is swifter of foot than any Greek except Achilles, and who has been"
5934,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,awarded that matchless hero’s arms as the prize of valour against all
5935,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"competitors,--rises in his wrath, and gives his gay entertainers a taste"
5936,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"of his quality. Not deigning even to throw off his mantle, he seizes a"
5937,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"huge stone quoit, and hurls it, after a single swing, far beyond the"
5938,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,point reached by any of the late competitors. The astonished islanders
5939,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,crouch to the ground as it sings through the air above their heads. Once
5940,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"roused, Ulysses launches out into the self-assertion which has been"
5941,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,remarked as being common to all the heroes of Homeric story. He
5942,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,challenges the whole circle of bystanders to engage with him in
5943,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,whatsoever contest they will--
5944,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5945,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,“All feats I know that are beneath the sun.”
5946,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5947,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"He will not, indeed, compare himself with some of the heroes of old,"
5948,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,such as were Hercules and Eurytus;
5949,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5950,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“But of all else I swear that I stand first,"
5951,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Such men as now upon the earth eat bread.”
5952,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5953,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,None of the Phæacians will accept the challenge. The king commends the
5954,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"spirit in which the stranger has repelled the insult of Euryalus, and"
5955,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"with the gay good-humour which marks the Phæacian character, confesses"
5956,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"that in feats of strength his nation can claim no real excellence, but"
5957,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"only in speed of foot and in seamanship; or, above all, in the dance--in"
5958,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,this no men can surpass them. His guest shall see and judge. Nine grave
5959,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"elders, by the king’s command (and here the satire is evident, even if"
5960,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"we have lost the application) stand forth as masters of the ceremonies,"
5961,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,and clear the lists for dancing. A band of selected youths perform an
5962,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"elaborate ballet, while the minstrel Demodocus sings to his harp a"
5963,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"sportive lay, not over-delicate, of the stolen loves of Mars and Venus,"
5964,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,and their capture in the cunning net of Vulcan. If it must be granted
5965,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"that this song forms a strong exception to the purity of Homer’s muse,"
5966,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"it has also been fairly pleaded for him, that it is introduced as"
5967,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,characteristic of an unwarlike nation and an effeminate society. But
5968,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,even in his lightest mood the poet has no sort of sympathy with a
5969,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,wife’s unfaithfulness. He takes his gods and goddesses as he found them
5970,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"in the popular creed; bad enough, and far worse than the mortal men and"
5971,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,women of his own poetical creation. But his own morals are far higher
5972,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,than those of Olympus. Even in this questionable ballad of the Phæacian
5973,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,minstrel the point of the jest is in strong contrast to some of the
5974,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"comedies of a more modern school. It is on the detected culprits, not on"
5975,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the injured husband, that the ridicule of gods and men is mercilessly"
5976,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"showered. When the ballet is concluded, two of the king’s sons, at their"
5977,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"father’s bidding, perform a sort of minuet, in which ball-play is"
5978,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,introduced. Ulysses expresses his admiration of the whole performance in
5979,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,words which sound like solemn irony:--
5980,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5981,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“O king, pre-eminent in word and deed,"
5982,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Of late thy lips the threatening vaunt did make
5983,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,That these thy dancers all the world exceed--
5984,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Now have I seen fulfilment of thy rede;
5985,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Yea, wonder holds me while I gaze thereon.”"
5986,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5987,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,So all passes off with pleasant compliments between hosts and guest. The
5988,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"king and his twelve peers present Ulysses with costly gifts, and"
5989,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Euryalus, in pledge of regret for his late unseemly speech, offers his"
5990,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,own silver-hilted sword with its ivory scabbard.
5991,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5992,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,From the games they pass again to the banquet; and one more glimpse is
5993,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"given us of the gentle Nausicaa, perfectly in keeping with the maiden"
5994,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,guilelessness of her character. Ulysses--still radiant with the more
5995,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,than human beauty which the goddess has bestowed upon him--moves to his
5996,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,place in the hall.
5997,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
5998,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“He from the bath, cleansed from the dust of toil,"
5999,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Passed to the drinkers; and Nausicaa there
6000,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Stood, moulded by the gods exceeding fair."
6001,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"She on the roof-tree pillar leaning, heard"
6002,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Odysseus; turning, she beheld him near."
6003,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Deep in her breast admiring wonder stirred,"
6004,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,And in a low sweet voice she spake this winged word.
6005,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
6006,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"“‘Hail, stranger-guest! when fatherland and wife"
6007,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Thou shalt revisit, then remember me,"
6008,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,Since to me first thou owest the price of life.’
6009,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,And to the royal virgin answered he:
6010,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"‘Child of a generous sire, if willed it be"
6011,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"By Thunderer Zeus, who all dominion hath,"
6012,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"That I my home and dear return yet see,"
6013,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"There at thy shrine will I devote my breath,"
6014,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"There worship thee, dear maid, my saviour from dark death.’”"
6015,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
6016,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"It is not easy to discover, with any certainty, what the Greek poet"
6017,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,meant us to understand as to the feelings of Nausicaa towards Ulysses.
6018,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"It has been said that Love, in the complex modern acceptation of the"
6019,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"term, is unknown to the Greek poets. Nor is there, in this passage, any"
6020,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,approach to the expression of such a feeling on the part of the
6021,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"princess. Yet, had the scene found place in the work of a modern poet,"
6022,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"we should have understood at once that, without any kind of reproach to"
6023,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the perfect maidenly delicacy of Nausicaa, it was meant to show us the"
6024,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,dawn of a tender sentiment--nothing more--towards the stranger-guest
6025,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"whom the gods had endowed with such majestic graces of person, who stood"
6026,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"so high above all rivals in feats of strength and skill, whose"
6027,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"misfortunes surrounded him with a double interest, and, above all, in"
6028,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,whom she felt a kind of personal property as his deliverer.
6029,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
6030,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,The Greek historian Plutarch chivalrously defends the young princess
6031,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"from the charge of forwardness, which ungallant critics brought against"
6032,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"her as early as his day. It was no marvel, he says, that she knew and"
6033,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"valued a hero when she saw him, and preferred him to the carpet-knights"
6034,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"of her own country, who were good only at the dance and the banquet. But"
6035,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"with her it was, after all, a sentiment, and no more; but which might"
6036,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"have ripened into love, under other circumstances, had the hero of her"
6037,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,maiden fancy been as free to choose as she was.
6038,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,
6039,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,So vanishes from the page one of the sweetest creations of Greek
6040,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"fiction--the more charming to us, as coming nearest, perhaps, of all to"
6041,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,the modern type of feeling. The farewell to Nausicaa is briefly said;
6042,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"and Ulysses, sitting by King Alcinous at the banquet, pays a high"
6043,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"compliment to the blind minstrel, and gives him a new theme for song."
6044,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Since he knows so well the story of the great Siege, let him now take"
6045,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"his lyre, and sing to them of the wondrous Horse. Demodocus obeys. He"
6046,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"sings how the Greeks, hopeless of taking Troy by force of arms, had"
6047,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,recourse at last to stratagem: how they constructed a huge framework in
6048,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"the shape of a horse, ostensibly an offering to the gods, and then set"
6049,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"fire to their sea-camp, and sailed away--for home, to all"
6050,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,appearance--leaving an armed company hidden in the womb of the wooden
6051,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"monster; how the Trojans, after much doubt, dragged it inside their"
6052,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"walls, and how, in the night-time, the Greeks issued from their strange"
6053,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"ambush, and spread fire and sword through the devoted city. And all"
6054,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,along Ulysses is the hero of the lay. He is the leader of the venturous
6055,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,band who thus carried their lives in their hands into the midst of their
6056,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"enemies: he it is who, “like unto Mars,” storms the house of Deiphobus,"
6057,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"who had taken Helen to wife after the death of his brother Paris, and"
6058,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,restores the Spartan princess to her rightful lord. Tears of emotion
6059,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,again fill the listener’s eyes; and again the courteous king bids the
6060,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"minstrel cease, when he sees that some chord of mournful remembrance is"
6061,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"struck in the heart of his guest. But he now implores him, as he has"
6062,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"good right to do, to tell them who he really is. Why does the Tale of"
6063,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Troy so move him? The answer, replies the stranger, will be a long tale,"
6064,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"and sad to tell; but his very name, he proudly says, is a history--“I am"
6065,ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.,"Ulysses, son of Laertes!”"

6074,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6075,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"The narrative, which Ulysses proceeds to relate to his host, takes back"
6076,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"his story to the departure of the Greek fleet from Troy. First, on his"
6077,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"homeward course, he and his comrades had landed on the coast of Thrace,"
6078,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,and laid waste the town of the Ciconians. Instead of putting to sea
6079,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"again with their plunder, the crews stayed to feast on the captured"
6080,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"beeves and the red wine. “Wrapt in the morning mist,” large bodies of"
6081,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"the natives surprised them at this disadvantage, and they had to"
6082,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,re-embark with considerable loss. This was the beginning of their
6083,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"troubles. They were rounding the southern point of Greece, when a storm"
6084,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"bore them out far to sea, and not until sunset on the tenth day did they"
6085,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,reach an unknown shore--the land of the Lotus-eaters--
6086,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6087,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"“Who, on the green earth couched beside the main,"
6088,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Seemed ever with sweet food their lips to entertain.”
6089,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6090,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,To determine the geography of the place is as difficult as to ascertain
6091,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"the natural history of the lotus, though critics have been very"
6092,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,confident in doing both.[34] The effect of the seductive food on the
6093,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,companions of Ulysses is thus described:--
6094,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6095,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,“And whoso tasted of their flowery meat
6096,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Cared not with tidings to return, but clave"
6097,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Fast to that tribe, for ever fain to eat,"
6098,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Reckless of home-return, the tender Lotus sweet.”"
6099,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6100,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Those who ate of it had to be dragged back by main force to their
6101,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"galleys, and bound fast with thongs, so loath were they to leave that"
6102,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"shore of peaceful rest and forgetfulness. In the words of our own poet,"
6103,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,who has founded one of the most imaginative of his poems on this
6104,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"incident of Ulysses’ voyage, so briefly told by Homer--"
6105,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6106,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"“Most weary seemed the sea, weary the oar,"
6107,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.
6108,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Then some one said--‘We will return no more:’
6109,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,And all at once they sang--‘Our island-home
6110,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam.’”[35]
6111,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6112,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,It has been thought that here we have possibly the bread-fruit tree of
6113,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"the South Sea Islands, with some hint of the effect produced by their"
6114,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"soft and enervating climate, and that the voyage of Ulysses anticipated"
6115,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"in some degree the discoveries of Anson and Cook. It is curious that, in"
6116,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Cook’s case, the seductions of those islands gave him the same trouble"
6117,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"as they did Ulysses; for several of his crew thought, like the Greek"
6118,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"sailors, that they had found an earthly paradise for which they"
6119,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"determined to forget home and country, and had to be brought back to"
6120,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"their ship by force. But the lotus-land of the poet is an ideal shore,"
6121,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,to which some of us moderns may have travelled as well as Ulysses. Its
6122,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,deepest recesses will have been reached by the Buddhist who attains his

6125,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,mistake. It is the _dolce far niente_ of the Italian; the region free
6126,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,from all cares and responsibilities--“beyond the domain of
6127,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"conscience”--which Charles Lamb, half in jest and half in earnest,"
6128,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,sighed for.
6129,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6130,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Bearing away from the shore of the Lotus-eaters, Ulysses and his crew"
6131,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,next reached the island where the Cyclops dwell--a gigantic tribe of
6132,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"rude shepherds, monsters in form, having but one eye planted in the"
6133,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"centre of their foreheads, who know neither laws, nor arts, nor"
6134,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,commerce. Adventure and discovery have always a charm for Ulysses; and
6135,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"it was with no other motive, as he pretty plainly confesses, that he"
6136,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,landed with his own ship’s crew to explore these unknown regions. The
6137,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,present adventure had a horrible conclusion for some of his companions.
6138,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Alone, in a vast cave near the shore, dwelt the giant Polyphemus, a son"
6139,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"of Neptune the sea-god, and folded his flocks in its deep recesses. They"
6140,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"did not find the monster within: but the pails of brimming milk, and"
6141,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"huge piles of cheese, stood ranged in order round the walls of the"
6142,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,cavern. Nothing would satisfy Ulysses but to await the owner’s return.
6143,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"At evening he came, driving his flocks before him; and, as was his wont,"
6144,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,began to busy himself in his dairy operations. By the red glow of the
6145,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"firelight he soon discovered the intruders, as they crouched in a"
6146,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"corner. In vain they made appeal to his hospitality, reminding him that"
6147,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,strangers were under the special care of Jupiter. What care the Cyclops
6148,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"race for the gods? So he seized two of the unhappy Greeks, dashed them"
6149,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"on the ground--“like puppies”--devoured them, blood, bones, and all,"
6150,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"after the manner of giants, and washed down his horrible supper with"
6151,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,huge bowls of milk. Two more furnished him with breakfast in the
6152,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,morning. But the craft of Ulysses was more than a match for the savage.
6153,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,He had carried with him on his dangerous expedition (having a kind of
6154,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,presentiment that it would prove useful) a skin of wine of rare quality
6155,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"and potency, and of this he gave Polyphemus to drink after his last"
6156,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"cannibal meal. Charmed with the delicious draught, the giant begged to"
6157,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,know his benefactor’s name. The answer of Ulysses is the oldest specimen
6158,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,on record of the art of punning.
6159,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6160,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,“‘Hear then; my name is Noman. From of old
6161,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"My father, mother, these my comrades bold,"
6162,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Give me this title.’ So I spake, and he"
6163,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Answered at once with mind of ruthless mould:
6164,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,‘This shall fit largess unto Noman be--
6165,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Last, after all thy peers, I promise to eat thee.”"
6166,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6167,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Then, overcome by the potent drink, the savage lay down to sleep."
6168,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Ulysses had prepared the thin end of a huge club of olive-wood, and"
6169,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"this, pointed and well hardened in the fire, he and his comrades thrust"
6170,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"into his single eye-ball, boring it deep in, “as the shipwright doth an"
6171,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"auger.” Roaring with pain, and now fairly sobered, Polyphemus awoke, and"
6172,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,shouted for help to his brother-Cyclops who dwelt in the neighbouring
6173,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,valleys. They came; but to all their questions as to what was the
6174,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"matter, or who had injured him, he only answered “_Noman!_”--and his"
6175,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,friends turned away in disgust. After groping vainly round the cave in
6176,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"search of his tormentors, Polyphemus rolled the huge stone from the"
6177,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"mouth of his den, and let his sheep go out, feeling among them for his"
6178,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"captives, who would probably try thus to escape. But again the wit of"
6179,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,the Ithacan chief proved too subtle for his enemy. The great sheep had
6180,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"been cunningly linked together three abreast, and every middle sheep"
6181,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"carried a Greek tied under his belly; Ulysses, after tying the last of"
6182,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"his companions, clinging fast to the wool of a huge ram, the king of the"
6183,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,flock. So did they all escape to rejoin their anxious comrades. But when
6184,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"all had embarked, and rowed to a safe distance, then Ulysses stood high"
6185,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"upon his deck, and shouted a taunting defiance to his enemy. The answer"
6186,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,of Polyphemus was a huge rock hurled with all his might towards the
6187,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"voice, which fell just short of the vessel. Again Ulysses shouted, and"
6188,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"bade him tell those who should hereafter ask him who did the deed, that"
6189,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,it was even Ulysses the Ithacan. The Cyclops groaned with rage and
6190,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,grief--an ancient oracle had forewarned him of the name; but will the
6191,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"great Ulysses please to return, that he may entertain such a hero"
6192,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,handsomely? He would have shown himself more simple than his enemy if he
6193,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,had. Then the blind monster lifted his cry to his great father the
6194,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Sea-god, and implored his vengeance on his destroyer."
6195,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6196,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,The one-eyed giant of Homer’s story became a very popular comic
6197,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,character in classical fiction. The only specimen of the old Greek

6199,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"satyrs were largely introduced--is a play by Euripides, ‘The Cyclops,’"
6200,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,in which the principal incident is the blinding of Polyphemus by
6201,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Ulysses. The monster rushes out of his cave, with his eye-socket burnt"
6202,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"and bleeding, and stretches his arms across the entrance to intercept"
6203,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"the escape of Ulysses, who creeps out between his legs. He roars out"
6204,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"with pain, and is taunted by the “Chorus,”--a party of satyrs whom he"

6265,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"seas, they won the friendship of the King of the Winds. He feasted them"
6266,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"a whole month on his brass-bound island; and he, too, like all the world"
6267,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"of gods and men, asked eagerly for the last news of the heroes of Troy."
6268,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"So charmed was Æolus with his guest, that on his departure he presented"
6269,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Ulysses with an ox-hide tied with a silver cord, in which all the winds"
6270,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"were safely confined, save only Zephyr, who was left loose to waft the"
6271,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,voyagers safely home. So for nine days and nights they ran straight for
6272,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Ithaca, Ulysses himself at the helm, for he would trust it to no other"
6273,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,hand. And now they had come in sight of the rocks of their beloved
6274,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,island--so near that they could see the smoke go up from the herdsmen’s
6275,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"camp-fires; when, overcome with long watching, the chief fell asleep"
6276,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,upon the deck. Then the greed and curiosity of his companions tempted
6277,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"them to examine the ox-hide bag. It must be some rich treasure, surely,"
6278,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,thus carefully tied up and stowed away. They opened it; out rushed the
6279,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"imprisoned blasts, and drove them back in miserable plight to the island"
6280,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"of Æolus,--much to that monarch’s astonishment. In vain did Ulysses tell"

6282,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Æolus would have nothing more to do with such an ill-starred wretch,"

6327,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,The abode of Circe presents quite a different picture from the grotto of

6343,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"“Black, with a milk-white flower, in heavenly tongue"

6345,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6346,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Armed with this, he can defy all Circe’s enchantments. She mixed for him"

6358,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,spending a whole year in her society. The ingenious critics who insist
6359,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,on shaping a moral allegory out of the story of the Odyssey confess to
6360,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,having found a stumbling-block in this point of the narrative. It sounds
6361,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,very plausible to say that in Circe is personified sensual pleasure;
6362,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"that those who partake of her cup, and are turned into swine, are those"
6363,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,who brutalise themselves by such indulgences; that the herb Moly--black
6364,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"at the root, but white and beautiful in the blossom--symbolises"
6365,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"“instruction” or “temperance,” by which the temptations of sense are to"
6366,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"be resisted. But Ulysses’ victory over the enchantress, and his"
6367,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"subsequent relations to her, fall in but awkwardly with any moral of any"
6368,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,kind. To say that Ulysses knows how to indulge his appetites with
6369,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"moderation, and therefore escapes the penalties of excess--that he is"
6370,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"the master of Pleasure, while his companions become its slaves--is to"
6371,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"make the parable teach a very questionable form of morality indeed,"
6372,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"since it represents self-indulgence as praiseworthy, if we can only"
6373,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,manage to escape the consequences.
6374,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6375,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,But it was not until Ulysses had been reminded by his companions that he
6376,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"was forgetting his fatherland, that he besought his fair entertainer to"
6377,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"let him go. Reluctantly she consented, bound by her oath--warning him,"
6378,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"as they parted, that toil and peril lay before him, and that if he would"
6379,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"learn his future fate, he must visit the Regions of the Dead, and there"
6380,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,consult the shade of the great prophet Tiresias.
6381,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6382,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Ulysses goes on to describe to the king of the Phæacians his voyage on
6383,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"from the island of Ææa, under the favouring gales which Circe sends"

6388,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Till the sun stooped beneath the western wave,"
6389,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,And darkness veiled the spaces of the sea.
6390,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Then to the limitary land came we

6392,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"Shrouded in mist and gloom continually,"
6393,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"That people, from sweet light secluded well,"
6394,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"The dark Cimmerian tribe, who skirt the realms of hell.”"
6395,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,
6396,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Who these Cimmerians were is not easily discoverable. Their name was
6397,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,held by the Greeks a synonym for all that was dark and barbarous in the
6398,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"mists of antiquity. It appears, nevertheless, in the earlier historians"
6399,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"as the appellation of a real people; some rash ethnologists, tempted"
6400,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"chiefly by the similarity of name, have tried to identify them with the"
6401,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,Cymry--the early settlers of Wales. The Welsh are notoriously proud of
6402,ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.,"their ancient origin, but it is doubtful how far they would accept the"

6417,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,episode is remarked as out of character with the light and easy
6418,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"narrative into which it has been woven. Be this as it may, the passage"
6419,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,has a strong interest in itself. It is the solitary glimpse which we
6420,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,have of the poet’s creed as to the state of disembodied spirits. It is
6421,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,at least not in contradiction to the views which are disclosed--scantily
6422,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"enough--by the author of the Iliad, though here we find them"
6423,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,considerably more developed. It is a gloomy picture at the best; and we
6424,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,almost cease to wonder at the shrinking from death which is so often
6425,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"displayed by the Homeric heroes, when we find their future state"
6426,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"represented as something almost worse, to an active mind, than"

6464,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,From the lips of Tiresias Ulysses has learnt the future which awaits
6465,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,him. On the coast of Sicily he should find pasturing the herds and

6467,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,should soon see again their native Ithaca; if they laid sacrilegious

6485,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"As they talked together, there swept forth out of the gloom a crowd of"
6486,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"female shapes--the mothers of the mighty men of old. There came Tyro,"
6487,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"beloved by the sea-god Neptune, from whom sprang Neleus, father of"
6488,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Nestor: next followed Antiope, who bore to Jupiter Amphion and Zethus,"
6489,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"who built the seven-gated Thebes; Iphimedeia, mother of the giants Otus"
6490,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"and Ephialtes, who strove to take heaven itself by storm; Alcmena, Leda,"
6491,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Ariadne, and a crowd of the heroines of Greek romance, who had found the"
6492,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"loves of the gods more or less disastrous in their earthly lot, and who"
6493,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"were reaping, in the gloomy immortality which the poet assigns them,"
6494,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,such consolation as they might from knowing themselves the mothers of

6496,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6497,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Here Ulysses would have ended his tale, and for a while a charmed"

6502,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Yes--if his host cares to listen, Ulysses can tell him a sad tale of"
6503,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"some of his old comrades. He saw the great Agamemnon there, and heard"
6504,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,from his lips the treachery of the adulterous Clytemnestra. Antilochus
6505,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"and Patroclus, too, he had recognised, and Ajax; but the latter,"
6506,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"retaining in the world below the animosities of earthly life, had stood"
6507,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"far aloof, and sullenly refused to speak a word in answer to his"
6508,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,successful rival. The only one who reveals anything of the secrets of
6509,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,his prison-house is Achilles. He asks of his adventurous visitor what
6510,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"has prompted him to risk this intrusion into the gloomy dwelling, where"
6511,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"the dead live indeed, but without thought or purpose, mere shadows of"
6512,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,what they were. And when Ulysses attempts to comfort him with the
6513,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"thought of the deathless glory which surrounds his name, the"
6514,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"hopelessness of his answer sets forth, in the darkest colours, that"
6515,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,gloomy view of human destiny which breaks out from time to time in the
6516,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"creed of the poet, and which belongs to the character of his favourite"
6517,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,hero. Whether the Odyssey did or did not come from the same hand as the
6518,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Iliad, at least Achilles is the same in both. In the former poem we"
6519,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"find him indulging in all the mournful irony of the Hebrew Preacher, in"
6520,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,his perplexed thought before he was led to “the conclusion of the whole
6521,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"matter”--complaining, like him, that “one event happeneth to all,” and"
6522,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"that “the wise man dieth as the fool;” that he, the bravest and most"
6523,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"beautiful of living heroes, would have to meet the same lot as his"
6524,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"victim Lycaon; so here, in the Odyssey, he adopts the text that “a"
6525,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,living dog is better than a dead lion:”--
6526,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6527,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"“Rather would I, in the sun’s warmth divine,"
6528,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Serve some poor churl who drags his days in grief,"
6529,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,Than the whole lordship of the dead were mine.”
6530,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6531,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,Such was the immortality to which Paganism condemned even its best and
6532,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,bravest.
6533,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6534,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,One touching inquiry both Agamemnon and Achilles put to their visitor
6535,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,from the upper world. How fare their sons? Where is Orestes?--asks the
6536,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"great king. Did Neoptolemus, in the later days of the war, prove himself"
6537,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,worthy of his father?--inquires Achilles. When he has been assured of
6538,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"this, the shade of the mighty hero, well satisfied,"
6539,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6540,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,“Passed striding through the fields of asphodel.”
6541,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6542,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,There is no distinct principle of reward or punishment discernible in
6543,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"the regions of the dead, as seen by Ulysses. Indeed, anything like"
6544,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,happiness in this shadowy future seems incompatible with the feelings
6545,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"put into the mouth of Achilles. Orion, the mighty hunter, appears to"
6546,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"enjoy something like the Red Indian’s paradise--pursuing, in those"
6547,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"shadowy fields, the phantoms of the wild creatures which he slew on"
6548,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"earth; but, with this exception, there is no hint of pleasurable"
6549,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,interest or occupation for the mighty dead. Punishments there are for
6550,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,notorious offenders against the majesty of the gods:--
6551,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6552,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"“There also Tantalus in anguish stood,"
6553,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,Plunged in the stream of a translucent lake;
6554,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,And to his chin welled ever the cold flood.
6555,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"But when he rushed, in fierce desire to break"
6556,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"His torment, not one drop could he partake."
6557,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,For as the old man stooping seems to meet
6558,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"That water with his fiery lips, and slake"
6559,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"The frenzy of wild thirst, around his feet,"

6561,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6562,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,“Also the thick-leaved arches overhead
6563,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Fruit of all savour in profusion flung,"
6564,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,And in his clasp rich clusters seemed to shed.
6565,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"There citrons waved, with shining fruitage hung,"
6566,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Pears and pomegranates, olive ever young,"
6567,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,And the sweet-mellowing fig: but whensoe’er
6568,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"The old man, fain to cool his burning tongue,"
6569,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Clutched with his fingers at the branches fair,"
6570,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,Came a strong wind and whirled them skyward through the air.”
6571,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6572,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,“And I saw Sisyphus in travail strong

6579,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"He, straining, the great toil resumed, while sweat"

6581,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,
6582,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"Both these are examples of punishment inflicted in the Shades below, not"
6583,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"for an evil life, but for personal offences against the sovereign of the"
6584,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,gods. Tantalus had been admitted as a guest to the banquet of the
6585,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"immortals, and had stolen their nectar and ambrosia to give to his"
6586,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"fellow-men. Sisyphus had been, it is true, a notorious robber on earth,"
6587,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,but the penalty assigned him was for the higher crime of betraying an
6588,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,amour of Jupiter’s which had come to his knowledge. The stone of
6589,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,Sisyphus has been commonly taken as an illustration of labour spent in
6590,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,vain; but a modern English poet has found in it a beautiful illustration
6591,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,of the indestructibility of hope. In one of Lord Lytton’s ‘Tales of

6686,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,broke out at last into something like mutiny. He had some show of

6690,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,the toils and dangers which wore out ordinary mortals were a mere
6691,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,disport. Seeing that the rest backed Eurylochus in his proposal to land
6692,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"and rest, Ulysses was fain to give way, after exacting a vow that at"
6693,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"least none of them should lay sacrilegious hands upon the sacred herds,"
6694,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"since they had store of corn and wine, the parting gifts of Circe, on"
6695,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,board their vessel. But stress of weather detained them in the anchorage
6696,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"a whole month, until corn and wine were exhausted, and they had to snare"
6697,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,birds and catch fish--a kind of food which a Greek seaman especially
6698,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"despised--to keep them from starving. Then at last, while their chief"
6699,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"had withdrawn to a quiet spot, and fallen asleep wearied with long"
6700,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"prayer, Eurylochus persuaded the rest to break their vow, and slay the"
6701,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,choicest of the oxen. Terrible prodigies followed the unhallowed meal;
6702,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"the skins of the slain animals moved and crawled after their slayers,"
6703,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"and the meat, while roasting on the spits, uttered fearful cries and"
6704,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,groans. One of the old allegorical interpreters has drawn from this
6705,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"incident a moral which, however fanciful, is not without a certain"
6706,THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.,"beauty and appositeness of illustration--the sins of the wicked, he"

6726,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"The hero, at his departure, is loaded with rich presents of honour from"
6727,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,his Phæacian hosts. The twelve princes of the kingdom each contribute
6728,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,their offering--gold and changes of raiment; the king adds a gold
6729,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"drinking-cup of his own, and Queen Arete a mantle and tunic. The careful"
6730,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"queen also supplies him with a magnificent chest, in which she packs his"
6731,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,treasures with her own royal hands; and Ulysses secures the whole with a
6732,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"“seaman’s knot,” whose complications will defy the uninitiated--a secret"
6733,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"which he has learnt from Circe, and which he seems to have handed down"
6734,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"to modern sailors. Thus equipped, he is sent on board one of the magic"
6735,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"galleys, to be conveyed home to his native Ithaca. They embark in the"
6736,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"evening, and early the next morning the crew--apparently in order to"
6737,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,give the adventure the half-ludicrous turn which seems inseparable from
6738,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"the Phæacians--land their passenger, still sound asleep, and leave him"
6739,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"on shore under an olive-tree, with his store of presents heaped beside"
6740,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"him. When he awakes, he fails to recognise his native island, for"
6741,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Minerva has spread a mist over it. The goddess herself presently
6742,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"accosts him, in the form of a shepherd, and listens patiently to a story"
6743,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"which the hero invents, with his usual readiness, to account for his"
6744,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"presence on the island. Then she discovers herself, with a somewhat"
6745,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,ironical compliment on the inveterate craftiness which has led him to
6746,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,attempt to impose on the wisest of the immortals. She tells him news of
6747,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"his wife and of his son, and promises him her help against the accursed"
6748,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"suitors. She lays her golden wand upon him, and lo! the majestic"
6749,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"presence which had touched the maiden fancy of Nausicaa, and won him"
6750,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,favour in the eyes of the Phæacian court (to say nothing of Circe and
6751,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Calypso) has at once given place to the decrepitude of age. The ruddy
6752,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"cheeks grow wrinkled, the bright eyes are dimmed, the flowing locks"
6753,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"turned grey, and Ulysses is, to all appearance, an aged beggar, clad in"
6754,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"squalid rags. Thus disguised, so that none shall recognise him till his"
6755,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"hour comes, he seeks shelter, by direction of the goddess, with his own"
6756,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,swineherd Eumæus.
6757,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6758,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Eumæus is one of the most characteristic personages in the poem, and has"
6759,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,given the most trouble to the poet’s various critics. He occupies a sort
6760,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"of forester’s lodge in the woods, where the vast herds of swine"
6761,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"belonging to the absent king are fed by day, and carefully lodged at"
6762,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"night. Though he is but a keeper of swine, Homer applies to him"
6763,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"continually the epithets “godlike,” and “chief of men,” which he"
6764,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,commonly uses only of territorial lords such as Ulysses and Menelaus. He
6765,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"not only has subordinates in his employ, but an attendant slave, whom he"
6766,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,has purchased with his own money; and he so far exercises an
6767,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,independent right of property in the animals which are under his care as
6768,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"to kill and dress them--two at a time, such is the lavish hospitality of"
6769,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,the age--to feast the stranger-guest who has now come to him. It may be
6770,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"straining a point to see in him, as one of the most genial of Homeric"
6771,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"critics does, “a genuine country gentleman of the age of Homer;” but his"
6772,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"position, so far as it is possible to compare it with anything at all in"
6773,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"modern social life, appears something like that of the agricultural"
6774,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"steward of a large landed proprietor, with whom his relations, though"
6775,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"strictly subordinate, are of a highly confidential and friendly"
6776,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,character. The charge of the swine would be a much more important office
6777,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"in an age when, as is plain from many passages both in the Iliad and the"
6778,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Odyssey, the flesh of those animals held a place of honour at the"
6779,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,banquets of chiefs and kings: and as we find that even the sons of a
6780,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,royal household did not think the keeping of sheep beneath their
6781,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"dignity, so the care of other animals would by no means imply a menial"
6782,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"position. Eumæus, indeed, turns out to be himself of princely"
6783,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,birth--stolen in his childhood by a treacherous nurse from the island
6784,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"where his father was king, sold by Phœnician merchants to Laertes in"
6785,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Ithaca, and brought up in his household almost as a son, and regarding"
6786,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,the lost Ulysses “as an elder brother.” Very loyal is he to the house of
6787,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,his benefactors; prefacing his meal by a prayer that his lord may yet
6788,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"return in safety, and grieving specially that the lady Penelope, in her"
6789,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"present troubles, has seldom the opportunity to see or speak with him in"
6790,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,the kindly intercourse of old. The cordial and simple relations between
6791,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,master and servant--even though the servant was commonly nothing more or
6792,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"less than a purchased slave--are a striking feature, very pleasant to"
6793,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"dwell upon, in these Homeric poems. They remind us, as Homer does so"
6794,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"often, of similar pictures in the sacred narrative of the gentler"
6795,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,affections which redeemed so often the curse of slavery--of the little
6796,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,captive Israelite maiden whose concern for her Syrian master led to his
6797,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"cure, and of the faithful steward, “born in the house” of Abraham, whom"
6798,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,the childless patriarch once thought to make his heir.
6799,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6800,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Eumæus entertains the stranger right hospitably--warning him, at the"
6801,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"same time, not to pretend, as others have often done in the hope of"
6802,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"reward, to bring tidings of the lost Ulysses. His guest’s own story he"
6803,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"will be glad to hear. The hero is always ready at narrative, whether the"
6804,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,tale is to be fact or fiction. At present he chooses fiction; he gives
6805,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"his listener an imaginary history of his past life, as a Cretan chief"
6806,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"who had seen much good service in many lands, especially under King"
6807,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Idomeneus at Troy, but who had met with a succession of disasters since."
6808,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Of course he had seen and known Ulysses; had heard of him since the fall
6809,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,of Troy; and he offers his host a wager that he will yet return. Eumæus
6810,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,will hear nothing of such flattering hopes; by this time his men are
6811,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"coming in from the field, and when the swine are safely housed, supper"
6812,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"and bedtime follow. But the night is bitter cold, and Ulysses has"
6813,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,nothing but his beggar’s rags. He indirectly begs a covering from his
6814,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"host by an ingenious story, very characteristic of the style of the"
6815,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,lighter episodes of the Odyssey. He relates an adventure of his own
6816,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"while lying in ambush, one winter night, under the walls of Troy. Dr"
6817,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Maginn’s translation of this passage, in the old English ballad style,"
6818,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"though somewhat free, preserves fairly the spirit and humour of the"
6819,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,original:--
6820,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6821,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,“Oh! were I as young and as fresh and as strong
6822,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"As when under Troy, brother soldiers among,"
6823,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,In ambush as captains were chosen to lie
6824,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Odysseus and King Menelaus and I!
6825,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6826,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"“They called me as third, and I came at the word,"
6827,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,And reached the high walls that the citadel gird;
6828,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,When under the town we in armour lay down
6829,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,By a brake in the marshes with weeds overgrown.
6830,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"The night came on sharp, bleak the north wind did blow,"
6831,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,And frostily cold fell a thick shower of snow.
6832,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6833,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,“Soon with icicles hoar every shield was frozen o’er;
6834,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,But they who their cloaks and their body-clothes wore
6835,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"The night lightly passed, secure from the blast,"
6836,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Asleep with their shields o’er their broad shoulders cast;
6837,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"But I, like a fool, had my cloak left behind,"
6838,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Not expecting to shake in so piercing a wind.
6839,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6840,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,“My buckler and zone--nothing more--had I on;
6841,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"But when the third part of the night-watch was gone,"
6842,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"And the stars left the sky, with my elbow then I"
6843,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Touched Odysseus, and spoke to him, lying close by--"
6844,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Noble son of Laertes, Odysseus the wise,"
6845,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,I fear that alive I shall never arise.
6846,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6847,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,“‘In this night so severe but one doublet I wear--
6848,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Deceived by a god--and my cloak is not here,"
6849,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,And no way I see from destruction to flee.’
6850,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,But soon to relieve me a project had he.
6851,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"In combat or council still prompt was his head,"
6852,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,And into my ear thus low whisp’ring he said:--
6853,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6854,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,“‘Let none of the band this your need understand;
6855,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Keep silent.’ Then, resting his head on his hand,--"
6856,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"‘Friends and comrades of mine,’ he exclaimed, ‘as a sign,"
6857,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,While I slept has come o’er me a dream all divine.
6858,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"It has warned me how far from the vessels we lie,"
6859,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,And that some one should go for fresh force to apply;
6860,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6861,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"“‘And his footsteps should lead, disclosing our need,"
6862,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"To King Agamemnon, our chieftain, with speed.’"
6863,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"Thoas rose as he spoke, flung off his red cloak,"
6864,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"And running, his way with the message he took;"
6865,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"While, wrapt in his garment, I pleasantly lay"
6866,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Till the rise of the golden-throned queen of the day.
6867,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,
6868,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,"“‘If I now were as young, and as fresh, and as strong,"
6869,ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.,Perhaps here in the stables you swine-herds among

6898,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,"him in a dream that, under his present circumstances, such delays are"
6899,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,"dangerous. Penelope has a hard time of it in his absence, even her"

6903,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,"one of the richest of the rivals, is beginning to find favour in her"

6981,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,"from Ulysses, and Telemachus promises the shipwrecked wanderer relief"
6982,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,and protection. He sends Eumæus to announce his own safe return to

6987,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,all the majesty of presence which he had worn before. But Telemachus
6988,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,does not recognise the father whom he has never known; the sudden
6989,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,transformation rather suggests to him some heavenly visitant. He was but
6990,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,an infant when Ulysses went to Troy; and even when his father assures
6991,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.,"him of his identity, he will not believe. There is a quiet sadness, but"

7026,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,some among them have already determined on his assassination. The
7027,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"swineherd follows to the palace, bringing with him, by command of"
7028,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Telemachus, the seeming beggar--for Ulysses has undergone a second"
7029,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"transformation, and is once more an aged man in mean apparel. As a poor"

7032,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"out his plans of vengeance, without raising the suspicions of the"

7034,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,whose character stands in marked contrast to that of Eumæus. He is
7035,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"utterly faithless to his absent master’s interests, and has become the"
7036,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,ready instrument of his enemies. With mocking insolence he jeers at
7037,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Eumæus and his humble acquaintance, and even goes so far as to spurn the"
7038,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,latter with his foot. Ulysses fully justifies his character for patience
7039,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,and endurance; though for a moment he does debate in his heart the

7042,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,As he draws near the gates of his own palace he espies another old
7043,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"retainer, of a different type, belonging to a race noted in all lands"

7056,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,Eustathius (who made none the worse archbishop because he was a thorough

7140,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"appears, he threatens to drive him from the hall. Ulysses quietly warns"
7141,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,him to keep his hands off--there is room enough for both. The young
7142,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"nobles shout with delight at a quarrel which promises such good sport,"
7143,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"and at once form a ring for the combatants, and undertake to see fair"
7144,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,play. When the disguised king strips off his squalid rags for the
7145,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"boxing-match, and discovers the brawny chest and shoulders for which he"
7146,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"was remarkable, Irus trembles at the thought of encountering him. But it"
7147,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"is too late: with a single blow Ulysses breaks his jaw, and drags him"
7148,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,out into the courtyard. The revellers now hail the conqueror with loud
7149,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"applause, and award him the prize of victory--a goat-paunch filled with"
7150,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"mince-meat and blood, the prototype, apparently, both of the Scotch"
7151,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,haggis and the English black-pudding. Amphinomus--who has already shown
7152,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,something of a nobler nature than the rest--adds a few words of generous
7153,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,sympathy: he sees in the wandering mendicant one who has known better
7154,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"days, and pledges him in a cup of wine, with a hope that brighter"
7155,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,fortunes are yet in store. Ulysses is touched with pity for the fate
7156,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,which the young man’s evil companions are inevitably drawing on him. He
7157,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"had heard, he tells him, of his father, Nisus--had known him, doubtless,"
7158,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,in fact--a wise and good man; such ought the son to be. He adds a voice
7159,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"of ominous warning, tinged with that saddened view of man at his best"
7160,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"estate which continually breaks forth, even amidst the lighter passages"
7161,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,of the poet.
7162,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,
7163,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,“Earth than a man no poorer feebler thing
7164,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Rears, of all creatures that here breathe or move;"
7165,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Who, while the gods lend health, and his knees string,"
7166,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,Boasts that no sorrow he is born to prove.
7167,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"But when the gods assail him from above,"
7168,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Then doth he bear it with a bitter mind,"
7169,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Dies without help, or liveth against love.”"
7170,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,
7171,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Penelope now descends from her chamber for a moment into the hall, to"
7172,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,have speech with her son. The goddess Minerva has shed on her such
7173,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"radiant grace and beauty, that her appearance draws forth passionate"
7174,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,admiration from Eurymachus. She does but taunt him in reply: most
7175,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"suitors, she says, at least bring presents in their hand; these of hers"
7176,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"do but rob, where others give freely. They are all stung sufficiently"
7177,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,by her words to produce at once from their stores some costly
7178,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"offerings--embroidered robes, chains and brooches and necklaces of gold"
7179,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"and electrum. The queen, after the practical fashion of the age, is not"
7180,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,too disdainful to carry them off to her chamber; while Ulysses--as
7181,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,indeed seems more in accordance with his character--secretly rejoices to
7182,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,see his wife thus “spoiling the Egyptians.” Some commentators have
7183,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,apologised for this seeming meanness on the part of Penelope by the
7184,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"explanation, that she does it to inspire them with false hopes of her"
7185,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"choosing one of them now at last for her husband, and so lulling them"
7186,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,into a false security in order to insure their easier destruction. But
7187,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"it is best to take the moral tone of these early poems honestly, as we"
7188,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"find it, and not attempt to force it into too close agreement with our"
7189,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,own.
7190,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,
7191,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"After some further acts of insult, still borne with a wrathful endurance"
7192,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"by Ulysses, the company quit the hall, as usual, for the night. Then"
7193,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Penelope descends again from her chamber, and sitting by the hearth,"
7194,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,bids a chair be set also for the wandering stranger: she will hear his
7195,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,tale. He represents himself to her as the brother of King Idomeneus of
7196,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Crete, and as having once in his brother’s absence entertained the great"
7197,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Ulysses in his halls. To Penelope’s eager questions, by which she seeks"
7198,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"to test his veracity, he answers by describing not so much the person of"
7199,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"her husband as his distinctive dress. The queen recognises, in this"
7200,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"description, the curiously-embroidered mantle which she had worked for"
7201,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"him, and the golden clasp, “linked with twin stars,” which she had"
7202,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,fastened with her own hands when he parted from her to go to Troy. She
7203,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,breaks into floods of tears at the recollection; while the disguised
7204,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Ulysses sets his eyes hard, “as though they were of horn or steel,” and"
7205,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,checks his rising tears. He comforts her with the assurance that he
7206,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,brings recent news of her hero--of his shipwreck and visit to the
7207,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"Phæacians; that he is even now on his way to Ithaca, last heard of in"
7208,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"the neighbouring island of Dulichium, within easy reach of home; nay,"
7209,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"this very year, he would be content to pledge himself, Ulysses shall"
7210,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"stand once more in his own halls. Incredulous, yet thankful for the"
7211,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"comfort, the queen orders the wanderer to be taken to the bath, and"
7212,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,entertained as an honoured guest. But he refuses all attendance save
7213,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,that of the aged Eurycleia. She marks with wonder his likeness to her
7214,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"absent master; but such resemblance, he assures her, has been noticed"
7215,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"frequently by others. As she bathes his feet, her eyes fall on a"
7216,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"well-remembered scar, left by a wound received from a boar’s tusk in his"
7217,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,youth while hunting on Mount Parnassus with his grandsire
7218,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,Autolycus.[41] The old nurse doubts no longer. She lets the foot fall
7219,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"heavily, and upsets the bath."
7220,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,
7221,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"“Surely thou art Ulysses--yes, thou art--"
7222,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"My darling child, and I not knew my king"
7223,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,Till I had handled thee in every part!”
7224,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,
7225,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"He puts his hand upon her throat, and forcibly checks her outcry; his"
7226,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"purpose is not to be known openly as yet, for he feels there are few,"
7227,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"even of his own household, whom he can trust. He charges her--even on"
7228,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"pain of death, much as he loves her--to keep his secret; then, refusing"
7229,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"all softer accommodation, he lies down in the vestibule on a couch of"
7230,ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.,"bullhide, not sleeping, but nursing his wrath in a fever of"

7239,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7240,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7241,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,The morrow is a festival of Apollo. It is kept by the riotous crew in
7242,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,the halls of Ulysses with more than their usual revelry. The disguised
7243,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"hero himself, feeding at a small table apart by command of Telemachus,"
7244,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,is still subject to their insults. But portents are not wanting of their
7245,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,impending doom. In the midst of the feast Minerva casts them into fits
7246,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,of ghastly laughter; the meat which they are eating drips with gore; and
7247,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,the seer Theoclymenus--a refugee under the protection of Telemachus--who
7248,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"has been of late their unwilling companion, sees each man’s head"
7249,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"enveloped in a misty darkness, and the whole court and vestibule"
7250,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"thronged with ghostly shapes. He cries out in affright, and tells them"
7251,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"what sight he sees; but they only answer him with mockery, and threaten"
7252,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,to drive him forth as one who has lost his wits. After warning them of
7253,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"the fate which he foresees awaiting them, he quits the company. They"
7254,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"turn upon Telemachus, and taunt him with his sorry choice of guests:"
7255,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"first yon lazy disreputable vagabond, and now this prating would-be"
7256,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"soothsayer. The young man makes no reply, but watches his father"
7257,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,anxiously; and Ulysses still bides his time.
7258,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7259,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"The queen meanwhile has bethought her of a new device, to put off yet"
7260,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,awhile the evil day in which she must at length make her choice amongst
7261,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,her importunate lovers. She unlocks an inner chamber where the treasures
7262,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"of the house are stored, and draws from its case Ulysses’ bow, the gift"
7263,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"of his dead friend Iphitus, which he had not taken with him to Troy."
7264,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Before she carries it down, she lays it fondly on her knees, and weeps"
7265,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,as she thinks of its absent master. One cunning feat she remembers which
7266,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,her hero was wont to perform--to drive an arrow straight through the
7267,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,hollow rings of twelve axe-heads set up in a line. Whichsoever of her
7268,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"suitors can bend the strong bow, and send a shaft right through the"
7269,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"whole row of twelve, like the lost Ulysses, that man she will follow,"
7270,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"however reluctantly, as her future lord. She has more than a lingering"
7271,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"hope, we may be sure, that one and all will fail in a trial so"
7272,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"manifestly difficult. They would refuse the ordeal, but for Antinous."
7273,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Confident in his own powers, he hopes to succeed--he knows the rest will"
7274,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"fail. They, out of shame, accept the test. Telemachus himself fixes the"
7275,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"weapons firmly in the earth in a true and even line, a task in itself of"
7276,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"no small difficulty, but which he performs with such skill as to win the"
7277,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,admiration of the whole party. He claims the right to make trial first
7278,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"himself, in the hope to prove himself his father’s true son. Thrice he"
7279,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"draws the bow-string, but not yet to its right extent. As he is making a"
7280,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"fourth attempt, sanguine of success, he meets a look from his father"
7281,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,which checks his hand. Ulysses foresees that should his son succeed
7282,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"where the others fail, and so claim what they are really seeking, the"
7283,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"royal power of Ithaca, the whole band might suddenly unite against him,"
7284,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"and so frustrate his present scheme of vengeance. Reluctantly, at his"
7285,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"father’s sign, the youth lays down the bow, and professes to lament the"
7286,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,weakness of his degenerate hand. One after another the rival princes in
7287,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"turn strive to bend it, but in vain; even Antinous and Eurymachus,"
7288,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"notably the best among them, fail to move the string, though the bow is"
7289,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,warmed by the fire and rubbed well with melted fat to make it more
7290,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,pliable. Antinous finds plausible excuse for the failure--they have
7291,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,profaned the festival of Apollo by this contest; it shall be renewed
7292,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,under better auspices on the morrow. Then the seeming beggar (who
7293,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,meanwhile has made himself known as their true lord to Eumæus and
7294,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"another faithful retainer, the herdsman Philœtius) makes request that he"
7295,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,may try his hand upon this wondrous bow. Loud and coarse is the abuse
7296,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,which Antinous and his fellows shower upon him for his audacity; but
7297,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,Telemachus exerts the authority in his mother’s house which his
7298,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,uninvited guests seem never quite to make up their minds to dispute when
7299,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"it is firmly claimed, and the weapon is given into the hands of its true"
7300,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"owner. He handles it gently and lovingly, turning it over and over to"
7301,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"see whether it has in any way suffered by time or decay, and brings"
7302,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"notes from the tight-strained bow-string, “shrill and sweet as the voice"
7303,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"of the swallow.” At last he fits an arrow to the notch, and, not"
7304,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"deigning even to rise from his seat to make the effort, draws it to its"
7305,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"full stretch, and sends the shaft right through the whole line of"
7306,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,axe-heads. It is the immediate prelude to the bloody tragedy which
7307,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,follows--
7308,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7309,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"“‘Behold, the mark is hit,"
7310,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,Hit without labour! the old strength cleaves fast
7311,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Upon me, and my bones are stourly knit--"
7312,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,Not as the suitors mock me in their scornful wit.
7313,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7314,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,“‘Now is it time their evening meal to set
7315,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Before the Achaians, ere the sun go down."
7316,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"And other entertainment shall come yet,"
7317,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Dance and the song, which are the banquet’s crown.’"
7318,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"He spake, and with his eyebrows curved the frown."
7319,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Seizing his sword and spear Telemachus came,"
7320,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Son of Odysseus, chief of high renown,"
7321,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"And, helmeted with brass like fiery flame,"
7322,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,Stood by his father’s throne and waited the dire aim.
7323,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7324,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,“Stript of his rags then leapt the godlike king
7325,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"On the great threshold, in his hand the bow"
7326,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"And quiver, filled with arrows of mortal sting."
7327,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"These with a rattle he rained down below,"
7328,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Loose at his feet, and spake among them so:"
7329,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"‘See, at the last our matchless bout is o’er!"
7330,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Now for another mark, that I may know"
7331,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"If I can hit what none hath hit before,"
7332,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,And if Apollo hear me in the prayer I pour!’”
7333,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7334,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"The philosopher Plato, who did not spare the poet occasionally, in his"
7335,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"criticisms, speaks of this passage as worthy of all admiration. We have"
7336,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"here the primitive type, since worked out into countless shapes, of the"
7337,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,“situations” and “discoveries” which abound in modern romance and drama.
7338,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7339,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,Ulysses aims the first arrow at Antinous. It pierces him in the throat
7340,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"as he is raising a goblet to his lips, and he falls backward in the"
7341,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"agonies of death, spilling the untasted wine upon the floor; thus giving"
7342,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,occasion (so says Greek tradition) to that which has now become a common
7343,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,English proverb--“There’s many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.”[42]
7344,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"His comrades stand aghast for a moment, not certain whether the shot be"
7345,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,deliberate or merely accidental. Ulysses sets them at rest on that point
7346,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,by declaring himself and his purpose. They look round the hall for the
7347,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"arms which usually hang upon the walls, but these have been secretly"
7348,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"removed during the previous night by Ulysses and his son. Eurymachus,"
7349,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"who has more plausible rhetoric at his command than the others, now"
7350,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"endeavours to make terms. Antinous, he confesses, has well deserved his"
7351,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,fate--he had plotted against the life of Telemachus; but for himself and
7352,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"the rest, now that the king has come to his own again, they will submit"
7353,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"themselves, and pay such fine as shall amply satisfy him for the"
7354,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,despoiling of his goods. Ulysses scornfully rejects all such compromise.
7355,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Then, at Eurymachus’ call, the boldest of the party draw their knives"
7356,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,and make a rush upon him. But a second arrow from the terrible bow
7357,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,strikes Eurymachus through the breast before he reaches him; Amphinomus
7358,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,falls by the spear of Telemachus as soon as he gets within range; and
7359,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"while the father, backed by his two retainers, holds the rest at"
7360,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"bay--rather, we must suppose, by the terror of his presence than the"
7361,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,actual use of his bow--the son rushes off to find arms for the little
7362,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"party. Ulysses plies his arrows till they are exhausted, and then the"
7363,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,four together continue the unequal combat with the spears now brought
7364,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"by Telemachus. The details of the work of retribution, like some of the"
7365,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"long slaughter-lists in the Iliad, sufficiently interesting to an"
7366,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"audience for whom war was the great game of human life, are scarcely so"
7367,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"to modern and more fastidious readers. The hero, like all heroes of"
7368,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"romance, performs deeds which in a mere prosaic view would appear"
7369,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"impossibilities. Suffice it to say, that with the Goddess of Wisdom as"
7370,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"an ally (who appears once more under the form of Mentor), the combat"
7371,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"ends in the slaughter of the whole band of intruders, even though they"
7372,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"are partially supplied with arms by the treacherous goatherd, who brings"
7373,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,them from the armoury which Telemachus has carelessly left open. A graze
7374,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"upon the wrist of Telemachus, and a slight flesh-wound where the spear"
7375,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,of one of the enemy “wrote on the shoulder” of the good swineherd
7376,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Eumæus, are the only hurts received by their party in the combat. The"
7377,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"vengeance of the hero is implacable; otherwise it were not heroic, in"
7378,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,the Homeric sense. Not content with the utter extermination of the men
7379,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"who have usurped his palace, harassed his wife, and insulted his son, he"
7380,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"hangs up also their guilty paramours among the women-servants, who have"
7381,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"joined them in defiling his household gods; first, however, making them"
7382,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,swill and scour clean the blood-stained hall which has been the scene of
7383,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,the slaughter. The traitorous goatherd Melanthius is by the same stern
7384,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"orders miserably lopped of ears, and nose, and limbs, before death"
7385,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,releases him. We find the same pitiless cruelty towards his enemies in
7386,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,the hero of the Odyssey as in the hero of the Iliad. Yet the poet would
7387,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,teach us that the vengeance of Ulysses is but the instrument of the
7388,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"divine justice. Like Moses or Joshua, he is but the passionless executor"
7389,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"of the wrath of heaven; while, still to continue the parallel, the"
7390,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,merciless character of the retribution takes its colour from the
7391,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"ferocity of the age. When the aged Eurycleia, who as yet alone of the"
7392,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"women of the household knows the secret of his return, comes down and"
7393,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"sees the floor strewn with the bloody corpses, she is about to raise a"
7394,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,shout of triumph. But the king checks her:--
7395,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,
7396,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"“Nurse, with a mute heart this my vengeance hail!"
7397,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,Not holy is it o’er the slain to boast.
7398,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,These Heaven and their own crimes have brought to bale;
7399,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Since of all strangers, from earth’s every coast,"
7400,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"No man was honoured of this godless host,"
7401,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,"Nor good nor evil, whosoe’er they knew--"
7402,THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.,And with their souls they pay the fatal cost.”

7413,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,doors between the men’s and women’s apartments had been carefully locked
7414,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"by Eumæus, by his lord’s order. Even when the nurse rushes up to her"
7415,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"with the tidings that Ulysses himself has returned, and made this"
7416,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"terrible lustration of his household, she yet remains incredulous. The"
7417,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"riotous crew may have met their deserved fate, but the hand that has"
7418,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"slain them must be that of some deity, not of Ulysses. Yet she will go"
7419,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"down and look upon the corpses. There, leaning “by a pillar” in the"
7420,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"royal place--like King Joash at his coronation, or King Josiah when he"
7421,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,sware to the covenant--she beholds Ulysses. But he is still in his
7422,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"beggar’s weed, and after twenty years of absence she is slow to"
7423,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,recognise him. Both Eurycleia and Telemachus break into anger at her
7424,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,incredulity. The king himself is outwardly as little moved as ever. He
7425,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,will give tokens of his identity hereafter. For the present there are
7426,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,precautions to be taken. The slaughter of so many nobles of Ithaca will
7427,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,scarce be taken lightly when it is heard in the island; it must not be
7428,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"known abroad until he can try the temper of his subjects, and gather a"
7429,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,loyal host around him. All traces of the bloody scene which has just
7430,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"been enacted must be carefully concealed; the house must ring with harp,"
7431,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"and song, and dance, that all who hear may think the queen has made her"
7432,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"choice at last, and is holding her wedding-feast to-day--as, in truth,"
7433,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,in a better sense she shall. Ulysses himself goes to the bath to wash
7434,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,away the stains of slaughter. Thence he comes forth endued once more by
7435,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,his guardian goddess with the “hyacinthine” locks and the grand presence
7436,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,which he had worn in the court of Phæacia. He appeals now to his wife’s
7437,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"memory, for she yet gives no sure sign of recognition:--"
7438,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7439,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"“Lady, the gods that in Olympus dwell"
7440,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Have, beyond mortal women, given to thee"
7441,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Heart as of flint, which none can soften well."
7442,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Lives not a wife who could endure, save thee,"
7443,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Her lord to slight, who, roaming earth and sea,"
7444,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Comes to his own land in the twentieth year.
7445,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Haste, Eurycleia, and go spread for me"
7446,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Some couch, that I may sleep--but not with her.”"
7447,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7448,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Penelope does recognise the form and features--it is indeed, to all"
7449,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"outward appearance, the Ulysses from whom she parted in tears twenty"
7450,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"years ago. But such appearances are deceitful; gods have been known, ere"
7451,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"now, to put on the form of men to gain the love of mortals. She will put"
7452,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"him to one certain test she wots of. “Give him his own bed,” she says to"
7453,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"the nurse; “go, bring it forth from what was our bridal chamber.” But"
7454,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"the couch of which she speaks is, as she and he both well know,"
7455,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"immovable. Its peculiar structure, as detailed in Homer’s verse, is by"
7456,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,no means easy to unravel. But it is formed in some cunning fashion out
7457,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"of the stem of an olive-tree, rooted and growing, round which the hero"
7458,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"himself had built a bridal chamber. Move it?--“There lives no mortal,”"
7459,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"exclaims Ulysses, “who could stir it from its place.” Then, at last, all"
7460,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Penelope’s long doubts are solved in happy certainty:--
7461,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7462,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"“Then from her eyelids the quick tears did start,"
7463,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"And she ran to him from her place, and threw"
7464,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Her arms about his neck, and a warm dew"
7465,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Of kisses poured upon him, and thus spake:"
7466,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"‘Frown not, Odysseus; thou art wise and true!"
7467,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"But God gave sorrow, and hath grudged to make"
7468,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Our path to old age sweet, nor willed us to partake"
7469,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7470,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"“‘Youth’s joys together. Yet forgive me this,"
7471,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Nor hate me that when first I saw thy brow
7472,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"I fell not on thy neck, and gave no kiss,"
7473,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Nor wept in thy dear arms as I weep now.
7474,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,For in my breast a bitter fear did bow
7475,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"My soul, and I lived shuddering day by day,"
7476,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Lest a strange man come hither, and avow"
7477,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"False things, and steal my spirit, and bewray"
7478,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"My love; such guile men scheme, to lead the pure astray."

7485,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Whom my sire gave me, when I first was wed,"
7486,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,To guard the chamber of our bridal bed--
7487,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Now I believe against my own belief.’
7488,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,She ending a desire of weeping bred
7489,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Within him, and in tears the noble chief"
7490,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Clasped his true wife, exulting in their glorious grief."
7491,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7492,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"“Sweet as to swimmers the dry land appears,"
7493,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Whose bark Poseidon in the angry sea
7494,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Strikes with a tempest, and in pieces tears,"
7495,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"And a few swimmers from the white deep flee,"
7496,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Crested with salt foam, and with tremulous knee"
7497,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Spring to the shore exulting; even so
7498,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Sweet was her husband to Penelope,"
7499,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Nor from his neck could she at all let go
7500,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Her white arms, nor forbid her thickening tears to flow.”"
7501,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7502,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"When they retire to rest, each has a long tale to tell. The personal"
7503,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,adventures of Ulysses alone (however careful he might have been to
7504,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,abridge them in some particulars for his present auditor) would have
7505,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,made up many an Arabian Night’s entertainment. There would surely have
7506,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"been little time left for Penelope’s story, but that Minerva’s agency"
7507,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,lengthens the ordinary night--
7508,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7509,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,“Nor from the rolling river of Ocean’s stream
7510,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Suffered the golden-thronèd Dawn to beam,"
7511,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Or yoke the horses that bear light to men.”
7512,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7513,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Here, according to our modern notions of completeness, the Odyssey"
7514,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,should surely end. Accordingly some critics have surmised that the
7515,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"twenty-fourth and last book is not Homer’s, but a later addition. But we"
7516,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,may very well suppose that the primitive taste for narrative in the
7517,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,poet’s day was more simple and childlike; that an ancient Greek audience
7518,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"would inquire, as our own children would, into all the details of the"
7519,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"sequel, and not be satisfied even with the comprehensive assertion that"
7520,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"“they lived happy ever afterwards.” We have therefore, in the text as it"
7521,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"has come down to us, a kind of supplement to the tale, which, as is the"
7522,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"case with the later scenes in some of Shakespeare’s tragedies, rather"
7523,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,weakens the force of the real catastrophe. An episode at the beginning
7524,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"of this last book shows us again the regions of the dead, to which the"
7525,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,god Mercury is conducting the spirits of the dead suitors--pale ghosts
7526,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"who follow him, gibbering and cowering with fear, into that “sunless"
7527,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,land.” The main purpose of the poet seems to be the opportunity once
7528,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"more of introducing the shades of the great heroes, Achilles and"
7529,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Agamemnon; the latter contrasting his own miserable and dishonoured end
7530,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"with that of Achilles, blest above all mortals, dying in battle with all"
7531,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"the flower of Ilium and Greece around him, and leaving a name which is a"
7532,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"sound of glory over the whole earth. So also does he contrast, to"
7533,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Penelope’s honour, her fidelity with the treachery of his own queen"
7534,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Clytemnestra; giving voice to a prophecy which has been fulfilled almost
7535,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,beyond even a poet’s aspirations:--
7536,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7537,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,“O to her first one love how true was she!
7538,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Nought shall make dim the flower of her sweet fame
7539,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"For ever, but the gods unceasingly"
7540,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Shall to the earth’s inhabitants her name,"
7541,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Wide on the wings of song, with endless praise proclaim.”"
7542,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7543,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Ulysses himself has yet to visit and make himself known to his aged
7544,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"father Laertes, who is still alive, but living in sad retirement on his"
7545,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"island-farm, solacing himself as well as he may with pruning and tending"
7546,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"his orchard-grounds. The recognition scene, in which the scar left by"
7547,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"the boar’s tusk is once more the touchstone, will seem tedious, as"
7548,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"savouring too much of repetition, to most readers of our day. But there"
7549,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,is one point which has a special and simple beauty of its own. When
7550,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Laertes seems yet incredulous as to his son’s identity, Ulysses reminds"
7551,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"him how, when he was yet a child, following his father about the"
7552,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"orchards, and begging with a child’s pertinacity, he had given him “for"
7553,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"his very own” a certain number of apple, fig, and pear trees and"
7554,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,vines--all which he can still remember and enumerate. The token is
7555,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"irresistible, and the old man all but faints for joy."
7556,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7557,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"An attempt at rebellion on the part of some of his Ithacan subjects, who"
7558,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"are enraged at his slaughter of their nobles, and which is headed by the"
7559,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"father of the dead Antinous, fails to revive the fading interest of the"
7560,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,tale. The ringleader falls by a spear cast by the trembling hand of
7561,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Laertes, and the malcontents submit, after a brief contest, to their"
7562,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,lawful chief.
7563,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7564,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,A hint of future travel for the hero leaves his history in some degree
7565,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,still incomplete. A penance had been imposed upon him by the seer
7566,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Tiresias, by which alone he could appease Neptune for the cruel injury"
7567,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"inflicted on his son, the giant Polyphemus. He must seek out some people"
7568,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"who had never seen the sea, and never eaten salt, and there offer"
7569,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"sacrifice to the god. Then, and only then, he might hope to reign for"
7570,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,the rest of his life in peace amongst his islanders. Of the fulfilment
7571,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,of this pilgrimage the poet tells us nothing. Other legends represent
7572,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Ulysses as meeting his death at last from the hand of his own son
7573,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Telegonus (born of his amour with Circe), who had landed in the island"
7574,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,of Ithaca on a piratical enterprise. We may remark the coincidence--or
7575,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"the imitation--in the later legend of the British Arthur, who is slain"
7576,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,in battle by his illegitimate son Mordred. The veil which even tradition
7577,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,leaves hanging over the great wanderer’s fate is no inappropriate
7578,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"conclusion to his story. A life of inaction, even in his old age, seems"
7579,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,hardly suited to the poetical conception of this hero of unrest. In the
7580,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,fragmentary legends of the Middle Ages there is almost material for a
7581,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"second Odyssey. There, the Greek voyager becomes the pioneer of Atlantic"
7582,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,discoverers--sailing still on into the unknown West in search of the
7583,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Earthly Paradise, founding new cities as he goes, and at last meeting"
7584,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"his death in Atlantic waters. The Italian poets--Tasso, Pulci, and"
7585,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"especially Dante--adopted the tradition. In the ‘Inferno’ of the latter,"
7586,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,the spirit of Ulysses thus discloses the last scenes of his career:--
7587,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,
7588,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"“Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence"
7589,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Of my old father, nor return of love,"
7590,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"That should have crowned Penelope with joy,"
7591,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Could overcome in me the zeal I had
7592,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"To explore the world, and search the ways of life,"
7593,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Man’s evil and his virtue. Forth I sailed
7594,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Into the deep illimitable main,"
7595,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"With but one bark, and the small faithful band"
7596,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"That yet cleaved to me. As Iberia far,"
7597,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Far as Marocco, either shore I saw,"
7598,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,And the Sardinian and each isle beside
7599,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age
7600,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Were I and my companions, when we came"
7601,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"To the strait pass, where Hercules ordained"
7602,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,The boundaries not to be o’erstepped by man.[43]

7604,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,On the other hand already Ceuta past.

7612,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.’
7613,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,With these few words I sharpened for the voyage
7614,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"The mind of my associates, that I then"
7615,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn
7616,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Our poop we turned, and for the witless flight"
7617,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Made our oars wings,[44] still gaining on the left."
7618,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Each star of the other pole night now beheld,"
7619,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"And ours so low, that from the ocean floor"
7620,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"It rose not. Five times re-illumed, as oft"
7621,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Vanished the light from underneath the moon,"
7622,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Since the deep way we entered, when from far"
7623,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"Appeared a mountain dim, loftiest methought"
7624,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Of all I e’er beheld. Joy seized us straight;
7625,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,But soon to mourning changed. From the new land
7626,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side"
7627,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirled her round
7628,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,With all the waves; the fourth time lifted up
7629,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,"The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:"
7630,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,And over us the booming billow closed.”

7633,THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.,Thus also Mr Tennyson--drawing from Dante not less happily than he so

7666,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7667,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"The resemblance which these Homeric poems bear, in many remarkable"
7668,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"features, to the romances of mediæval chivalry, has been long ago"
7669,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"remarked, and has already been incidentally noticed in these pages. The"
7670,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"peculiar caste of kings and chiefs--or kings and knights, as they are"
7671,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,called in the Arthurian and Carlovingian tales--before whom the
7672,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"unfortunate “churls” tremble and fly like sheep, is a feature common to"
7673,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,both. “Then were they afraid when they saw a knight”--is the pregnant
7674,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"sentence which, in Mallory’s ‘King Arthur,’ reveals a whole volume of"
7675,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"social history; for the knight, in the particular instance, was but"
7676,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"riding quietly along, and there ought to have been no reason why the"
7677,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“churls” should dread the sight of a professed redresser of grievances.
7678,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,But even so Ulysses condescends to use no argument to this class but the
7679,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,active use of his staff; and Achilles dreads above all things dying “the
7680,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"death of a churl” drowned in a brook. It is only the noble, the priest,"
7681,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,and the divine bard who emerge into the light of romance. The lives and
7682,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,feelings of the mere toilers for bread are held unworthy of the
7683,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,minstrel’s celebration. Just as in the early romances of Christendom we
7684,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"do not get much lower in the social scale than the knight and the lady,"
7685,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the bishop and the wizard, so in these Homeric lays--even in the more"
7686,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"domestic Odyssey, unless we make Eumæus the exception--the tale still"
7687,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"clings to the atmosphere of courts and palaces, and ignores almost"
7688,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"entirely, unless for the purpose of drawing out a simile or"
7689,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"illustration, the life-drama of the great mass of human kind. In both"
7690,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,these cycles of fiction we find represented a state of things--whether
7691,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,we call it the “heroic age” or the “age of chivalry”--which could hardly
7692,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"have existed in actual life; and in both the phase of civilisation, and"
7693,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the magnificence of the properties and the scenery, seem far beyond what"
7694,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the narrators could have themselves seen and known.
7695,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7696,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The character of the hero must not be judged by modern canons of
7697,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,morality. With all the honest purpose and steadfast heart which we
7698,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"willingly concede to him, we cannot but feel there is a shiftiness in"
7699,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,his proceedings from first to last which scarcely savours of true
7700,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"heroism. We need not call him, as Thersites does in Shakespeare, “that"
7701,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"dog-fox Ulysses,” nor even go quite so far as to look upon him as what a"
7702,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"modern translator terms him, “the Scapin of epic poetry;” but we see in"
7703,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"him the embodiment of prudence, versatility, and expediency, rather than"
7704,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of the nobler and less selfish virtues. Ulysses, both in the Iliad and"
7705,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"in the Odyssey, is the diplomatist of his age; and it is neither his"
7706,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"fault nor Homer’s that the diplomacy of that date was less refined, and"
7707,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"less skilful in veiling its coarser features. Even in much later times,"
7708,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,dissimulation has been held an indispensable quality in rulers;[45] and
7709,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"an English philosopher tells us plainly that “the intriguing spirit, the"
7710,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"overreaching manner, and the over-refinement of art and policy, are"
7711,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,naturally incident to the experienced and thorough politician.”[46] At
7712,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the same time, it must be remembered that Ulysses employs deceit only"
7713,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,where it was recognised and allowed by the moral code of the
7714,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,age--against his enemies; he is never for a moment otherwise than true
7715,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"to his friends. Nay, while the kings and leaders in the Iliad are too"
7716,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,fairly open to the reproach of holding cheap the lives and the interests
7717,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of the meaner multitude who followed them, Ulysses is, throughout his"
7718,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"long wanderings, the sole protecting providence, so far as their"
7719,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"wilfulness will allow him, of his followers as well as of himself."
7720,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7721,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The tale of his wanderings has been a rich mine of wealth for poets and
7722,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"romancers, painters and sculptors, from the dim date of the age which we"
7723,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"call Homer’s down to our own. In this wonderful poem, be its authorship"
7724,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"what it may, lie the germs of thousands of the volumes which fill our"
7725,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,modern libraries. Not that all their authors are either wilful
7726,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"plagiarists or even conscious imitators; but because the Greek poet,"
7727,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"first of all whose thoughts have been preserved to us in writing,"
7728,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"touched, in their deepest as well as their lightest tones, those chords"
7729,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,of human action and passion which find an echo in all hearts and in all
7730,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,ages.
7731,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7732,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"First, that is to say, of all whose utterances we regard as merely"
7733,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"human. There are, indeed, other recorded utterances to which the song of"
7734,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Homer, unlike as it is, has yet wonderful points of resemblance. For the"
7735,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"student of Scripture, the prince of heathen poets possesses a special"
7736,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,interest. It is quite unnecessary to insist upon the actual connection
7737,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,which some enthusiastic champions of sacred literature have either
7738,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,traced or fancied between the lays of the Greek bard and the inspired
7739,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"records of the chosen people. Whether the Hebrew chronicles, in any"
7740,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"form, could have reached the eye or ear of the poet in his many"
7741,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"wanderings is, to say the least, extremely doubtful. But Homer bears an"
7742,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"independent witness to the truth and accuracy of the sacred narrative,"
7743,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"so far as its imagery and diction are to be taken into account, which is"
7744,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,very remarkable and valuable. Allowing for the difference in the local
7745,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"scenery, the reader of the Iliad may well fancy at times that he is"
7746,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"following the night-march of Abraham, the conquests of Joshua, or the"
7747,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"wars of the Kings; while in the Odyssey the same domestic interiors, the"
7748,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"same primitive family life, the same simple patriarchal relations"
7749,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"between the king or chief of the tribe and his people, remind us in"
7750,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,every page of the fresh and living pictures of the book of Genesis.
7751,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Fresh and living the portraits still are, in both cases, after the lapse"
7752,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of so many centuries, because in both the writers drew faithfully from"
7753,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"what was before their eyes, without any straining after effect--without"
7754,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,any betrayal of that self-consciousness which spoils many an author’s
7755,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"best work, by forcing his own individuality upon the reader instead of"
7756,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,that of the scenes and persons whom he represents. To trace the many
7757,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,points of resemblance between these two great poems and the sacred
7758,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,records as fully as they might be traced would require a volume in
7759,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,itself. It may be enough in these pages shortly to point out some few of
7760,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the many instances in which Homer will be found one of the most
7761,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"interesting, because assuredly one of the most unconscious, commentators"
7762,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,on the Bible.
7763,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7764,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"The Homeric kings, like those of Israel and Judah, lead the battle in"
7765,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"their chariots: Priam sits “in the gate,” like David or Solomon:"
7766,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Ulysses, when he would assert his royalty, stands by a pillar, as stood"
7767,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Joash and Josiah. Their riches consist chiefly in “sheep and oxen,"
7768,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"men-servants and maid-servants.” When Ulysses, in the Iliad, finds"
7769,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Diomed sleeping outside his tent,--“and his comrades lay sleeping around"
7770,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"him, and under their heads they had their shields, and their spears were"
7771,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"fixed in the ground by the butt-end”[47]--we have the picture, almost"
7772,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"word for word, of Saul’s night-bivouac when he was surprised by David:"
7773,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"“And behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in"
7774,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the ground at his bolster, and the people lay round about him.” Ulysses"
7775,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"and Diomed think it not beneath their dignity, as kings or chiefs, to"
7776,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"act what we should consider the part of a spy, like Gideon in the camp"
7777,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of the Midianites. Lycurgus the Thracian slays with an ox-goad, like"
7778,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Shamgar in the Book of Judges. The very cruelties of warfare are the
7779,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"same--the insults too frequently offered to the dead body of an enemy,"
7780,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“the children dashed against the stones”--the miserable sight which
7781,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Priam foresees in the fall of his city, as Isaiah in the prophetic"
7782,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,burden of Babylon.[48]
7783,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7784,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"The outward tokens of grief are wholly Eastern. Achilles, in the Iliad,"
7785,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"when he hears of the death of his friend Patroclus--Laertes, in the"
7786,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Odyssey, when he believes his son’s return hopeless--throw dust upon"
7787,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"their heads, like Joshua and the elders of Israel when they hear of the"
7788,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,disaster at Ai. King Priam tears his hair and beard in his vain appeal
7789,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"to Hector at the Scæan gates, as Ezra does, when he hears of the"
7790,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,trespasses of the Jewish princes.[49] Penelope sits “on the threshold”
7791,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"to weep, just as Moses “heard the people weeping, every man in the door"
7792,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of his tent.” “Call for the mourning women,” says the prophet"
7793,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Jeremiah,[50] “that they may come; and let them make haste, and take up"
7794,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,a wailing for us.” So when the Trojan king bears off his dead son at
7795,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"last to his own palace, the professional mourners are immediately sent"
7796,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"for--“the bards, to begin the lament.”[51] As Moses carries forth the"
7797,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"bones of Joseph into Canaan, and David gathers carefully those of Saul"
7798,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"and Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, so Nestor charges the"
7799,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Greeks, when they have almost determined to quit Troy in despair, to"
7800,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,carry the bones of their slain comrades home to their native land.
7801,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Sarpedon’s body is borne to his native Lycia, there to be honoured “with"
7802,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,a mound and with a column”--as Jacob set up a pillar for his dead
7803,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Rachel on the road by Bethlehem. The Philistines, after the battle of"
7804,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Gilboa, bestow the armour of Saul in the house of their goddess"
7805,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Ashtaroth: the sword of Goliath is laid up as a trophy with the priest
7806,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Ahimelech, “wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod;”[52] even so does"
7807,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Hector vow to hang up the armour of Menelaus in the temple of Apollo in
7808,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Troy.
7809,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7810,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,The more peaceful images have the same remarkable likeness. The fountain
7811,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"in the island of Ithaca, faced with stone, the work of the forefathers"
7812,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of the nation, Ithacus and Neritus, recalls that “well of the"
7813,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"oath”--Beer-sheba--which Abraham dug, or that by which the woman of"
7814,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Samaria sat, known as “the well of our father Jacob.” The stone which"
7815,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the goddess Minerva upheaves to hurl against Mars, which “men of old had"
7816,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"set to be a boundary of the land”--the two white stones,[53] of unknown"
7817,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"date and history even in the poet’s own day, of which he doubts whether"
7818,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"they be sepulchral or boundary, which Achilles made the turning-point"
7819,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"for the chariot-race,--these cannot fail to remind us of the stones"
7820,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Bohan and Ebenezer, and of the warning in the Proverbs--“Remove not the"
7821,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set up.” The women grinding at"
7822,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the mill, the oxen treading out the corn, the measure by cubit, the"
7823,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"changes of raiment, the reverence due to the stranger and to the"
7824,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"poor,--the dowry given by the bridegroom, as by way of purchase, not"
7825,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"received with the bride,--all these are as familiar to us in the books"
7826,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,of Moses as in the poems of Homer. The very figures of speech are the
7827,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"same. The passionate apostrophe of Moses and Isaiah--“Hear, O heavens,"
7828,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"and give ear, O earth”--is used by Juno in the Iliad, and by Calypso in"
7829,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the Odyssey.[54] “Day” is commonly employed as an equivalent for fate or
7830,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,judgment; “the half of one’s kingdom” is held to be a right royal gift;
7831,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“the gates of hell” are the culmination of evil. Telemachus swears “by
7832,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the woes of his father,” as Jacob does “by the fear of his father"
7833,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Isaac;” and the curse pronounced on Phœnix by his father--“that never
7834,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,grandchild of his begetting might sit upon his knees”[55]--recalls the
7835,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"sacred text in which we are told that “the children of Machir, the son"
7836,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of Manasseh, were brought up on Joseph’s knees.”"
7837,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7838,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Many and various have been the theories of interpretation which have
7839,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"been employed, by more or less ingenious writers, to develop what they"
7840,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,have considered the inner meaning of the poet’s tale. Such speculations
7841,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,began at a very early date in literary history. They were current among
7842,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Greek philosophers in the days of Socrates, but he himself would not"
7843,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"admit them. It is impossible, and would be wearisome even if it were"
7844,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"possible, to discuss them all. But one especially must be mentioned, not"
7845,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"wholly modern, but which has won much favour of late in the world of"
7846,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"scholars,--that in both poems we have certain truths of physical and"
7847,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"astronomical science represented under an allegorical form, imported"
7848,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"into Greek fable from Eastern sources. This theory is, to say the least,"
7849,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"so interesting and ingenious, that without presuming here to discuss"
7850,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"its truth, it claims a brief mention. It may be fairest to put it in the"
7851,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,words of one of its most enthusiastic advocates. So far as it applies to
7852,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the Odyssey, it stands thus:--"
7853,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7854,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"“The Sun [Ulysses] leaves his bride the Twilight [Penelope] in the sky,"
7855,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"where he sinks beneath the sea, to journey in silence and darkness to"
7856,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,the scene of the great fight with the powers of Darkness [the Siege of
7857,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Troy]. The ten weary years of the war are the weary hours of the
7858,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,night.... The victory is won: but the Sun still longs to see again the
7859,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"beautiful bride from whom he parted yester-eve. Dangers may await him,"
7860,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,but they cannot arrest his steps: things lovely may lavish their beauty
7861,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"upon him, but they cannot make him forget her.... But he cannot reach"
7862,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,his home until another series of ten long years have come to an end--the
7863,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Sun cannot see the Twilight until another day is done.”[56]
7864,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7865,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"So, in the Iliad, as has been already noticed, Paris and the Trojans"
7866,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"represent the powers of Darkness, “who steal away the beautiful Twilight"
7867,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"[Helen] from the western sky;” while Achilles is the Sun, who puts to"
7868,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,rout these forces of the Night.[57]
7869,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7870,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"In contrast, though not necessarily in contradiction, to this physical"
7871,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"allegory, stands the moral interpretation, a favourite one with some of"
7872,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the mediæval students of Homer, which sees in the Odyssey nothing less"
7873,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,than the pilgrimage of human life--beset with dangers and seductions on
7874,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"every side, yet blessed with divine guidance, and reaching its goal at"
7875,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"last, through suffering and not without loss. Every point in the"
7876,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"wanderings of the hero has been thus made to teach its parable, more or"
7877,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,less successfully. The different adventures have each had their special
7878,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,application: Circe represents the especially sensual appetites; the
7879,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Lotus-eating is indolence; the Sirens the temptations of the ear; the
7880,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,forbidden oxen of the Sun the “flesh-pots of Egypt”--the sin of
7881,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"gluttony. It is at least well worthy of remark how, throughout the whole"
7882,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"narrative, the false rest is brought into contrast with the true. Not in"
7883,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the placid indolence of the Lotus-eaters, not in the luxurious halls of"
7884,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Circe or in the grotto of Calypso, nor even in the joyous society of the"
7885,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Phæacians, but only in the far-off home, the seat of the higher and"
7886,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"better affections, is the pilgrim’s real resting-place. The key-note of"
7887,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"this didactic interpretation, which has an undoubted beauty and pathos"
7888,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"of its own, making the old Greek poet, like the Mosaic law, a"
7889,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"schoolmaster to Christian doctrine, has been well touched by a modern"
7890,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,writer:--
7891,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7892,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“O beautiful and strange epitome
7893,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Of this our life, while through the tale we trace"
7894,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Homeless Ulysses on the land and sea!
7895,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,From childhood to old age it is the face
7896,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Of heaven-lost, yearning man: from place to place"
7897,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Whether he wander forth abroad, or knows"
7898,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"No change but of home-nature and of grace,"
7899,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Still is he as one seeking for repose--
7900,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"A man of many thoughts, a man of many woes.”[58]"
7901,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7902,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Some of the early religious commentators pushed such interpretations to
7903,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,extravagance; they dealt with Homer as the extreme patristic school of
7904,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,theology dealt with the Old Testament: they so busied themselves in
7905,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"seeking for mystical interpretations in every verse, that they held the"
7906,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,plain and literal meaning of the text as of almost secondary importance.
7907,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"It was said of one French scholar--D’Aurat--a man of some learning, that"
7908,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,he spent his life in trying to find all the Bible in Homer. Such men saw
7909,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Paradise disguised in the gardens of Alcinous; the temptation of the
7910,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,chaste Bellerophon was but a pagan version of the story of Joseph; the
7911,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"fall of Troy evidently prefigured, to their fancy, the destruction of"
7912,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Jerusalem. Some went even further, and turned this tempting weapon of"
7913,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,allegory against their religious opponents: thus Doctor Jacobus Hugo saw
7914,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"the Lutheran heretics prefigured in the Lotus-eaters of the Odyssey, and"
7915,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,thought that the reckless Antinous was a type of Martin Luther himself.
7916,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"Those who are content to take Homer as he is, the poet of all ages,"
7917,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,without seeking to set him up either as a prophet or as a moral
7918,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"philosopher, may take comfort from, the brief criticism of Lord Bacon"
7919,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,upon all over-curious interpretation--“I do rather think the fable was
7920,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"first, and the exposition devised after.” The most ingenious theories as"
7921,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,to the hidden meaning of the song are at best but the mists which the
7922,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,Homerists have thrown round their deity--
7923,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7924,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,“The moony vapour rolling round the king.”
7925,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,
7926,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,"He moves among them all, a dim mysterious figure, but hardly less than"
7927,CONCLUDING REMARKS.,divine.

8684,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,“This will be found a most admirable and useful Dictionary by the
8685,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"student, the man of business, or the general inquirer. Its design is to"
8686,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"supply a full and complete pronouncing etymological, and explanatory"
8687,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"Dictionary of the English language; and, as far as we can judge, in that"
8688,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,design it most completely succeeds. It contains an unusual number of
8689,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"scientific names and terms, English phrases, and familiar"
8690,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,colloquialisms; this will considerably enhance its value to the general
8691,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,searcher after information. The author seems to us to have planned the
8692,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,Dictionary exceedingly well. The Dictionary words are printed in bold
8693,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"black type, and in single letters, that being the form in which words"
8694,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,are usually presented to the reader. Capital letters begin such words
8695,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"only in proper names, and others which are always so printed. They are"
8696,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"grouped under a leading word, from which they may be presumed naturally"
8697,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"to fall or be formed, or singly follow in alphabetical order--only so,"
8698,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"however, when they are derived from the same leading root, and when the"
8699,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,alphabetical order may not be materially disturbed. The roots are
8700,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"enclosed within brackets, and for them the works of the best and most"
8701,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,recent authorities seem to have been consulted. The meanings are those
8702,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"usually given, but they have been simplified as much as possible."
8703,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"Nothing unnecessary is given; but, in the way of definition, there will"
8704,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,be found a vast quantity of new matter. The phonetic spelling of the
8705,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,words has been carefully revised by a Cambridge graduate--Mr Phelp; and
8706,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"Dr Page, the well-known geologist, has attended to the correctness of"
8707,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,the various scientific terms in the book. The Dictionary altogether is
8708,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,very complete.”--_Greenock Advertiser._
8709,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,
8710,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,“This Dictionary is admirable. The etymological part especially is good
8711,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"and sound. We have turned to ‘calamity,’ ‘forest,’ ‘poltroon,’ and a"
8712,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"number of other crucial words, and find them all derived according to"
8713,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"the newest lights. There is nothing about ‘calamus,’ and ‘foris,’ and"
8714,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"‘pollice truncus,’ such as we used in the etymological dictionaries of"
8715,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"the old type. The work deserves a place in every English School, whether"
8716,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,boys’ or girls’.”--_Westminster Review._
8717,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,
8718,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,“That which is now before us is evidently a work on which enormous pains
8719,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,have been bestowed. The compilation and arrangement give evidence of
8720,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,laborious research and very extensive scholarship. Special care seems to
8721,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"have been bestowed on the pronunciation and etymological derivation, and"
8722,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,the ‘root-words’ which are given are most valuable in helping to a
8723,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,knowledge of primary significations. All through the book are evidences
8724,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"of elaborate and conscientious work, and any one who masters the varied"
8725,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,contents of this Dictionary will not be far off the attainment of the
8726,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"complete art of ‘writing the English language with propriety,’ in the"
8727,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,matter of orthography at any rate.”--_Belfast Northern Whig._
8728,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,
8729,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,“This strikes us as likely to prove a useful and valuable work.... The
8730,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,number of scientific terms given is far beyond what we have noticed in
8731,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"previous works of this kind, and will in great measure render other"
8732,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,special dictionaries superfluous. Great care seems also to have been
8733,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,exercised in giving the correct etymology and pronunciation of words. We
8734,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,trust the work may meet with the success it deserves.”--_Graphic._
8735,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,
8736,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"“On the whole, we may characterise Mr Stormonth’s as a really good and"
8737,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,valuable Dictionary; and with the typical exceptions we have pointed
8738,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"out, we frankly allow his claim to have laboured earnestly and"

8752,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,painstaking labour and general accuracy. With regard to the scientific
8753,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"and technical words so extensively introduced into it, I must say, that"
8754,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,in this respect I know no Dictionary that so satisfactorily meets a real
8755,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,and widely felt want in our literature of reference. I have compared it
8756,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"with the large and costly works of Latham, Wedgwood, and others, and"
8757,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"find that in the fulness of its details, and the clearness of its"
8758,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"definitions, it holds its own even against them. The etymology has been"
8759,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"treated throughout with much intelligence, the most distinguished"
8760,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"authorities, and the most recent discoveries in philological science"
8761,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"having been laid under careful contribution.”--_Richard D. Graham, Esq.,"

8783,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"Schoolmaster.’ The Dictionary, which contains every word in ordinary"

8785,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"postfixes, with illustrative examples, and a vocabulary of Latin, Greek,"
8786,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"and other root-words, followed by derived English words. It will be"
8787,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"obvious to every experienced teacher, that these lists may be made"

8789,_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._,"language, and for helping unfortunate pupils over the terrible"
