37,CANTO XI,"""O thou Almighty Father, who dost make"
38,CANTO XI,"The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin'd,"
39,CANTO XI,But that with love intenser there thou view'st
40,CANTO XI,"Thy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name:"
41,CANTO XI,Join each created being to extol
42,CANTO XI,"Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise"
43,CANTO XI,Is thy blest Spirit.  May thy kingdom's peace
44,CANTO XI,"Come unto us; for we, unless it come,"
45,CANTO XI,With all our striving thither tend in vain.
46,CANTO XI,As of their will the angels unto thee
47,CANTO XI,"Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne"
48,CANTO XI,"With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done"
49,CANTO XI,By saintly men on earth.  Grant us this day
50,CANTO XI,"Our daily manna, without which he roams"
51,CANTO XI,"Through this rough desert retrograde, who most"
52,CANTO XI,Toils to advance his steps.  As we to each
53,CANTO XI,"Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou"
54,CANTO XI,"Benign, and of our merit take no count."
55,CANTO XI,'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not
56,CANTO XI,Our virtue easily subdu'd; but free
57,CANTO XI,From his incitements and defeat his wiles.
58,CANTO XI,"This last petition, dearest Lord! is made"
59,CANTO XI,"Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,"
60,CANTO XI,"But for their sakes who after us remain."""
61,CANTO XI,
62,CANTO XI,"Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,"
63,CANTO XI,Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
64,CANTO XI,"We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,"
65,CANTO XI,"But with unequal anguish, wearied all,"
66,CANTO XI,"Round the first circuit, purging as they go,"
67,CANTO XI,The world's gross darkness off: In our behalf
68,CANTO XI,"If there vows still be offer'd, what can here"
69,CANTO XI,"For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills"
70,CANTO XI,Have root of goodness in them?  Well beseems
71,CANTO XI,That we should help them wash away the stains
72,CANTO XI,"They carried hence, that so made pure and light,"
73,CANTO XI,They may spring upward to the starry spheres.
74,CANTO XI,
75,CANTO XI,"""Ah! so may mercy-temper'd justice rid"
76,CANTO XI,"Your burdens speedily, that ye have power"
77,CANTO XI,"To stretch your wing, which e'en to your desire"
78,CANTO XI,"Shall lift you, as ye show us on which hand"
79,CANTO XI,Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.
80,CANTO XI,"And if there be more passages than one,"
81,CANTO XI,Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;
82,CANTO XI,"For this man who comes with me, and bears yet"
83,CANTO XI,"The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,"
84,CANTO XI,"Despite his better will but slowly mounts."""
85,CANTO XI,"From whom the answer came unto these words,"
86,CANTO XI,"Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said:"
87,CANTO XI,
88,CANTO XI,"""Along the bank to rightward come with us,"
89,CANTO XI,And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
90,CANTO XI,Of living man to climb: and were it not
91,CANTO XI,"That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith"
92,CANTO XI,"This arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop"
93,CANTO XI,"My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,"
94,CANTO XI,Whose name thou speak'st not him I fain would view.
95,CANTO XI,To mark if e'er I knew himnd to crave
96,CANTO XI,His pity for the fardel that I bear.
97,CANTO XI,"I was of Latiun,  of a Tuscan horn"
98,CANTO XI,A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name
99,CANTO XI,"My sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard."
100,CANTO XI,My old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds
101,CANTO XI,"Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot"
102,CANTO XI,"The common mother, and to such excess,"
103,CANTO XI,"Wax'd in my scorn of all men, that I fell,"
104,CANTO XI,"Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,"
105,CANTO XI,"Each child in Campagnatico, can tell."
106,CANTO XI,I am Omberto; not me only pride
107,CANTO XI,"Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd"
108,CANTO XI,In mischief with her.  Here my lot ordains
109,CANTO XI,"Under this weight to groan, till I appease"
110,CANTO XI,"God's angry justice, since I did it not"
111,CANTO XI,"Amongst the living, here amongst the dead."""
112,CANTO XI,
113,CANTO XI,List'ning I bent my visage down: and one
114,CANTO XI,(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight
115,CANTO XI,"That urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd,"
116,CANTO XI,Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd
117,CANTO XI,"Intent upon me, stooping as I went"
118,CANTO XI,"Companion of their way.  ""O!""  I exclaim'd,"
119,CANTO XI,
120,CANTO XI,"""Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou"
121,CANTO XI,"Agobbio's glory, glory of that art"
122,CANTO XI,"Which they of Paris call the limmer's skill?"""
123,CANTO XI,
124,CANTO XI,"""Brother!"" said he, ""with tints that gayer smile,"
125,CANTO XI,Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.
126,CANTO XI,His all the honour now; mine borrow'd light.
127,CANTO XI,"In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,"
128,CANTO XI,"The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal"
129,CANTO XI,For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.
130,CANTO XI,Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.
131,CANTO XI,"Nor were I even here; if, able still"
132,CANTO XI,"To sin, I had not turn'd me unto God."
133,CANTO XI,"O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp'd"
134,CANTO XI,"E'en in its height of verdure, if an age"
135,CANTO XI,Less bright succeed not! imbue thought
136,CANTO XI,To lord it over painting's field; and now
137,CANTO XI,"The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd."
138,CANTO XI,Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd
139,CANTO XI,"The letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born,"
140,CANTO XI,Who shall drive either from their nest.  The noise
141,CANTO XI,"Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,"
142,CANTO XI,"That blows from divers points, and shifts its name"
143,CANTO XI,Shifting the point it blows from.  Shalt thou more
144,CANTO XI,"Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh"
145,CANTO XI,"Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,"
146,CANTO XI,"Before the coral and the pap were left,"
147,CANTO XI,Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that
148,CANTO XI,"Is, to eternity compar'd, a space,"
149,CANTO XI,Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye
150,CANTO XI,To the heaven's slowest orb.  He there who treads
151,CANTO XI,"So leisurely before me, far and wide"
152,CANTO XI,Through Tuscany resounded once; and now
153,CANTO XI,Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:
154,CANTO XI,"There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught"
155,CANTO XI,"The madd'ning rage of Florence, in that day"
156,CANTO XI,Proud as she now is loathsome.  Your renown
157,CANTO XI,"Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,"
158,CANTO XI,"And his might withers it, by whom it sprang"
159,CANTO XI,"Crude from the lap of earth.""  I thus to him:"
160,CANTO XI,"""True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe"
161,CANTO XI,"The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay"
162,CANTO XI,What tumours rankle there.  But who is he
163,CANTO XI,"Of whom thou spak'st but now?""--""This,"" he replied,"
164,CANTO XI,"""Is Provenzano.  He is here, because"
165,CANTO XI,"He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway"
166,CANTO XI,"Of all Sienna.  Thus he still hath gone,"
167,CANTO XI,"Thus goeth never-resting, since he died."
168,CANTO XI,"Such is th' acquittance render'd back of him,"
169,CANTO XI,"Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth.""  I then:"
170,CANTO XI,"""If soul that to the verge of life delays"
171,CANTO XI,"Repentance, linger in that lower space,"
172,CANTO XI,"Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,"
173,CANTO XI,"How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?"""
174,CANTO XI,
175,CANTO XI,"""When at his glory's topmost height,"" said he,"
176,CANTO XI,"""Respect of dignity all cast aside,"
177,CANTO XI,"Freely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,"
178,CANTO XI,"A suitor to  redeem his suff'ring friend,"
179,CANTO XI,"Who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,"
180,CANTO XI,Nor for his sake refus'd through every vein
181,CANTO XI,"To tremble.  More I will not say; and dark,"
182,CANTO XI,"I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon"
183,CANTO XI,Shall help thee to a comment on the text.
184,CANTO XI,"This is the work, that from these limits freed him."""

189,CANTO XII,CANTO XII
190,CANTO XII,
191,CANTO XII,"With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,"
192,CANTO XII,I with that laden spirit journey'd on
193,CANTO XII,Long as the mild instructor suffer'd me;
194,CANTO XII,"But when he bade me quit him, and proceed"
195,CANTO XII,"(For ""here,"" said he, ""behooves with sail and oars"
196,CANTO XII,"Each man, as best he may, push on his bark""),"
197,CANTO XII,"Upright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd"
198,CANTO XII,"My body, still in thought submissive bow'd."
199,CANTO XII,
200,CANTO XII,I now my leader's track not loth pursued;
201,CANTO XII,And each had shown how light we far'd along
202,CANTO XII,"When thus he warn'd me: ""Bend thine eyesight down:"
203,CANTO XII,For thou to ease the way shall find it good
204,CANTO XII,"To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet."""
205,CANTO XII,
206,CANTO XII,"As in memorial of the buried, drawn"
207,CANTO XII,"Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form"
208,CANTO XII,"Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof"
209,CANTO XII,"Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd,"
210,CANTO XII,"Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),"
211,CANTO XII,"So saw I there, but with more curious skill"
212,CANTO XII,"Of portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space"
213,CANTO XII,From forth the mountain stretches.  On one part
214,CANTO XII,"Him I beheld, above all creatures erst"
215,CANTO XII,"Created noblest, light'ning fall from heaven:"
216,CANTO XII,On th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd
217,CANTO XII,Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint
218,CANTO XII,Of mortal ice-stroke.  The Thymbraean god
219,CANTO XII,"With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,"
220,CANTO XII,"Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs"
221,CANTO XII,Strewn o'er th' ethereal field.  Nimrod I saw:
222,CANTO XII,"At foot of the stupendous work he stood,"
223,CANTO XII,"As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd"
224,CANTO XII,Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.
225,CANTO XII,
226,CANTO XII,O Niobe! in what a trance of woe
227,CANTO XII,"Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,"
228,CANTO XII,Sev'n sons on either side thee slain!  Saul!
229,CANTO XII,How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword
230,CANTO XII,"Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour"
231,CANTO XII,Ne'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!
232,CANTO XII,
233,CANTO XII,O fond Arachne! thee I also saw
234,CANTO XII,Half spider now in anguish crawling up
235,CANTO XII,Th' unfinish'd web thou weaved'st to thy bane!
236,CANTO XII,
237,CANTO XII,O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem
238,CANTO XII,Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote
239,CANTO XII,With none to chase him in his chariot whirl'd.
240,CANTO XII,
241,CANTO XII,Was shown beside upon the solid floor
242,CANTO XII,How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate
243,CANTO XII,That ornament in evil hour receiv'd:
244,CANTO XII,How in the temple on Sennacherib fell
245,CANTO XII,"His sons, and how a corpse they left him there."
246,CANTO XII,Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made
247,CANTO XII,"By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:"
248,CANTO XII,"""Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!"""
249,CANTO XII,Was shown how routed in the battle fled
250,CANTO XII,"Th' Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en"
251,CANTO XII,The relics of the carnage.  Troy I mark'd
252,CANTO XII,"In ashes and in caverns.  Oh! how fall'n,"
253,CANTO XII,"How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!"
254,CANTO XII,
255,CANTO XII,What master of the pencil or the style
256,CANTO XII,"Had trac'd the shades and lines, that might have made"
257,CANTO XII,"The subtlest workman wonder?  Dead the dead,"
258,CANTO XII,The living seem'd alive; with clearer view
259,CANTO XII,"His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,"
260,CANTO XII,"Than mine what I did tread on, while I went"
261,CANTO XII,Low bending.  Now swell out; and with stiff necks
262,CANTO XII,"Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,"
263,CANTO XII,Lest they descry the evil of your path!
264,CANTO XII,
265,CANTO XII,I noted not (so busied was my thought)
266,CANTO XII,"How much we now had circled of the mount,"
267,CANTO XII,"And of his course yet more the sun had spent,"
268,CANTO XII,"When he, who with still wakeful caution went,"
269,CANTO XII,"Admonish'd: ""Raise thou up thy head: for know"
270,CANTO XII,Time is not now for slow suspense.  Behold
271,CANTO XII,That way an angel hasting towards us!  Lo!
272,CANTO XII,Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
273,CANTO XII,From service on the day.  Wear thou in look
274,CANTO XII,"And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,"
275,CANTO XII,That gladly he may forward us aloft.
276,CANTO XII,"Consider that this day ne'er dawns again."""
277,CANTO XII,
278,CANTO XII,"Time's loss he had so often warn'd me 'gainst,"
279,CANTO XII,I could not miss the scope at which he aim'd.
280,CANTO XII,
281,CANTO XII,"The goodly shape approach'd us, snowy white"
282,CANTO XII,"In vesture, and with visage casting streams"
283,CANTO XII,Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.
284,CANTO XII,"His arms he open'd, then his wings; and spake:"
285,CANTO XII,"""Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now"
286,CANTO XII,"Th' ascent is without difficulty gain'd."""
287,CANTO XII,
288,CANTO XII,"A scanty few are they, who when they hear"
289,CANTO XII,"Such tidings, hasten.  O ye race of men"
290,CANTO XII,"Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind"
291,CANTO XII,So slight to baffle ye?  He led us on
292,CANTO XII,Where the rock parted; here against my front
293,CANTO XII,"Did beat his wings, then promis'd I should fare"
294,CANTO XII,In safety on my way.  As to ascend
295,CANTO XII,"That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands"
296,CANTO XII,"(O'er Rubaconte, looking lordly down"
297,CANTO XII,"On the well-guided city,) up the right"
298,CANTO XII,Th' impetuous rise is broken by the steps
299,CANTO XII,"Carv'd in that old and simple age, when still"
300,CANTO XII,The registry and label rested safe;
301,CANTO XII,"Thus is th' acclivity reliev'd, which here"
302,CANTO XII,Precipitous from the other circuit falls:
303,CANTO XII,But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.
304,CANTO XII,
305,CANTO XII,"As ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain"
306,CANTO XII,"Ineffable, sang: ""Blessed are the poor"
307,CANTO XII,"In spirit.""  Ah how far unlike to these"
308,CANTO XII,"The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,"
309,CANTO XII,There shrieks of woe!  We climb the holy stairs:
310,CANTO XII,And lighter to myself by far I seem'd
311,CANTO XII,"Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:"
312,CANTO XII,"""Say, master, of what heavy thing have I"
313,CANTO XII,"Been lighten'd, that scarce aught the sense of toil"
314,CANTO XII,"Affects me journeying?""  He in few replied:"
315,CANTO XII,"""When sin's broad characters, that yet remain"
316,CANTO XII,"Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac'd,"
317,CANTO XII,"Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,"
318,CANTO XII,Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will
319,CANTO XII,"Be so o'ercome, they not alone shall feel"
320,CANTO XII,"No sense of labour, but delight much more"
321,CANTO XII,"Shall wait them urg'd along their upward way."""
322,CANTO XII,
323,CANTO XII,"Then like to one, upon whose head is plac'd"
324,CANTO XII,Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks
325,CANTO XII,Of others as they pass him by; his hand
326,CANTO XII,"Lends therefore help to' assure him, searches, finds,"
327,CANTO XII,And well performs such office as the eye
328,CANTO XII,Wants power to execute: so stretching forth
329,CANTO XII,"The fingers of my right hand, did I find"
330,CANTO XII,"Six only of the letters, which his sword"
331,CANTO XII,Who bare the keys had trac'd upon my brow.
332,CANTO XII,"The leader, as he mark'd mine action, smil'd."
333,CANTO XII,
334,CANTO XII,
335,CANTO XII,
336,CANTO XII,
337,CANTO XIII,CANTO XIII
338,CANTO XIII,
339,CANTO XIII,"We reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood"
340,CANTO XIII,Upon the second buttress of that mount
341,CANTO XIII,"Which healeth him who climbs.  A cornice there,"
342,CANTO XIII,"Like to the former, girdles round the hill;"
343,CANTO XIII,Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.
344,CANTO XIII,
345,CANTO XIII,Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth
346,CANTO XIII,"The rampart and the path, reflecting nought"
347,CANTO XIII,"But the rock's sullen hue.  ""If here we wait"
348,CANTO XIII,"For some to question,"" said the bard, ""I fear"
349,CANTO XIII,"Our choice may haply meet too long delay."""
350,CANTO XIII,
351,CANTO XIII,Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
352,CANTO XIII,"He fastn'd, made his right the central point"
353,CANTO XIII,"From whence to move, and turn'd the left aside."
354,CANTO XIII,"""O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,"
355,CANTO XIII,"Conduct us thou,"" he cried, ""on this new way,"
356,CANTO XIII,"Where now I venture, leading to the bourn"
357,CANTO XIII,We seek.  The universal world to thee
358,CANTO XIII,Owes warmth and lustre.  If no other cause
359,CANTO XIII,"Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide."""
360,CANTO XIII,
361,CANTO XIII,"Far, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,"
362,CANTO XIII,In brief space had we journey'd; such prompt will
363,CANTO XIII,"Impell'd; and towards us flying, now were heard"
364,CANTO XIII,"Spirits invisible, who courteously"
365,CANTO XIII,Unto love's table bade the welcome guest.
366,CANTO XIII,"The voice, that firstlew by, call'd forth aloud,"
367,CANTO XIII,"""They have no wine;"" so on behind us past,"
368,CANTO XIII,"Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost"
369,CANTO XIII,"In the faint distance, when another came"
370,CANTO XIII,"Crying, ""I am Orestes,"" and alike"
371,CANTO XIII,"Wing'd its fleet way.  ""Oh father!""  I exclaim'd,"
372,CANTO XIII,"""What tongues are these?""  and as I question'd, lo!"
373,CANTO XIII,"A third exclaiming, ""Love ye those have wrong'd you."""
374,CANTO XIII,
375,CANTO XIII,"""This circuit,"" said my teacher, ""knots the scourge"
376,CANTO XIII,"For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn"
377,CANTO XIII,By charity's correcting hand.  The curb
378,CANTO XIII,"Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear"
379,CANTO XIII,"(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,"
380,CANTO XIII,Where pardon sets them free.  But fix thine eyes
381,CANTO XIII,"Intently through the air, and thou shalt see"
382,CANTO XIII,"A multitude before thee seated, each"
383,CANTO XIII,"Along the shelving grot.""  Then more than erst"
384,CANTO XIII,"I op'd my eyes, before me view'd, and saw"
385,CANTO XIII,Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;
386,CANTO XIII,"And when we pass'd a little forth, I heard"
387,CANTO XIII,"A crying, ""Blessed Mary! pray for us,"
388,CANTO XIII,"Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!"""
389,CANTO XIII,
390,CANTO XIII,I do not think there walks on earth this day
391,CANTO XIII,"Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn'd"
392,CANTO XIII,With pity at the sight that next I saw.
393,CANTO XIII,"Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now"
394,CANTO XIII,"I stood so near them, that their semblances"
395,CANTO XIII,Came clearly to my view.  Of sackcloth vile
396,CANTO XIII,Their cov'ring seem'd; and on his shoulder one
397,CANTO XIII,"Did stay another, leaning, and all lean'd"
398,CANTO XIII,"Against the cliff.  E'en thus the blind and poor,"
399,CANTO XIII,"Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,"
400,CANTO XIII,"Stand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk,"
401,CANTO XIII,
402,CANTO XIII,"So most to stir compassion, not by sound"

958,CANTO XVI,"That land, through which Adice and the Po"

1017,CANTO XVII,"Kindled in heav'n, spontaneous, self-inform'd,"

1029,CANTO XVII,"And round him Ahasuerus the great king,"

1031,CANTO XVII,Blameless in word and deed.  As of itself
1032,CANTO XVII,That unsubstantial coinage of the brain

1078,CANTO XVII,"The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark"
1079,CANTO XVII,"Arriv'd at land.  And waiting a short space,"
1080,CANTO XVII,"If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,"
1081,CANTO XVII,"Then to my guide I turn'd, and said: ""Lov'd sire!"

1225,CANTO XVIII,"She touch upon that theme.""  The moon, well nigh"
1226,CANTO XVIII,"To midnight hour belated, made the stars"

1232,CANTO XVIII,"And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,"
1233,CANTO XVIII,"Was lighten'd by the aid of that clear spirit,"
1234,CANTO XVIII,Who raiseth Andes above Mantua's name.
1235,CANTO XVIII,"I therefore, when my questions had obtain'd"

1242,CANTO XVIII,As echoing on their shores at midnight heard

1246,CANTO XVIII,By eagerness impell'd of holy love.
1247,CANTO XVIII,
1248,CANTO XVIII,Soon they o'ertook us; with such swiftness mov'd
1249,CANTO XVIII,The mighty crowd.  Two spirits at their head
