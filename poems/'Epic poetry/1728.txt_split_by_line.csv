81,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
82,PREFACE.,
83,PREFACE.,There would have been less controversy about the proper method of
84,PREFACE.,"Homeric translation, if critics had recognised that the question is a"
85,PREFACE.,"purely relative one, that of Homer there can be no final translation."
86,PREFACE.,The taste and the literary habits of each age demand different
87,PREFACE.,"qualities in poetry, and therefore a different sort of rendering of"
88,PREFACE.,"Homer. To the men of the time of Elizabeth, Homer would have appeared"
89,PREFACE.,"bald, it seems, and lacking in ingenuity, if he had been presented in"
90,PREFACE.,"his antique simplicity. For the Elizabethan age, Chapman supplied what"
91,PREFACE.,"was then necessary, and the mannerisms that were then deemed of the"
92,PREFACE.,"essence of poetry, namely, daring and luxurious conceits. Thus in"
93,PREFACE.,"Chapman’s verse Troy must “shed her towers for tears of overthrow,” and"
94,PREFACE.,"when the winds toss Odysseus about, their sport must be called “the"
95,PREFACE.,horrid tennis.”
96,PREFACE.,
97,PREFACE.,"In the age of Anne, “dignity” and “correctness” had to be given to"
98,PREFACE.,"Homer, and Pope gave them by aid of his dazzling rhetoric, his"
99,PREFACE.,"antitheses, his _netteté_, his command of every conventional and"
100,PREFACE.,"favourite artifice. Without Chapman’s conceits, Homer’s poems would"
101,PREFACE.,hardly have been what the Elizabethans took for poetry; without Pope’s
102,PREFACE.,"smoothness, and Pope’s points, the Iliad and Odyssey would have seemed"
103,PREFACE.,"rude, and harsh in the age of Anne. These great translations must"
104,PREFACE.,always live as English poems. As transcripts of Homer they are like
105,PREFACE.,pictures drawn from a lost point of view. _Chaque siècle depuis le xvie
106,PREFACE.,"a eu de ce côté son belvéder différent_. Again, when Europe woke to a"
107,PREFACE.,"sense, an almost exaggerated and certainly uncritical sense, of the"
108,PREFACE.,"value of her songs of the people, of all the ballads that Herder,"
109,PREFACE.,"Scott, Lonnrot, and the rest collected, it was commonly said that Homer"
110,PREFACE.,"was a ballad-minstrel, that the translator must imitate the simplicity,"
111,PREFACE.,and even adopt the formulae of the ballad. Hence came the renderings of
112,PREFACE.,"Maginn, the experiments of Mr. Gladstone, and others. There was some"
113,PREFACE.,excuse for the error of critics who asked for a Homer in ballad rhyme.
114,PREFACE.,"The Epic poet, the poet of gods and heroes, did indeed inherit some of"
115,PREFACE.,"the formulae of the earlier _Volks-lied_. Homer, like the author of"
116,PREFACE.,"_The Song of Roland_, like the singers of the _Kalevala_, uses"
117,PREFACE.,"constantly recurring epithets, and repeats, word for word, certain"
118,PREFACE.,"emphatic passages, messages, and so on. That custom is essential in the"
119,PREFACE.,"ballad, it is an accident not the essence of the epic. The epic is a"
120,PREFACE.,"poem of complete and elaborate art, but it still bears some birthmarks,"
121,PREFACE.,"some signs of the early popular chant, out of which it sprung, as the"
122,PREFACE.,"garden-rose springs from the wild stock, When this is recognised the"
123,PREFACE.,"demand for ballad-like simplicity and “ballad-slang” ceases to exist,"
124,PREFACE.,and then all Homeric translations in the ballad manner cease to
125,PREFACE.,represent our conception of Homer. After the belief in the ballad
126,PREFACE.,"manner follows the recognition of the romantic vein in Homer, and, as a"
127,PREFACE.,"result, came Mr. Worsley’s admirable Odyssey. This masterly translation"
128,PREFACE.,does all that can be done for the Odyssey in the romantic style. The
129,PREFACE.,"smoothness of the verse, the wonderful closeness to the original,"
130,PREFACE.,"reproduce all of Homer, in music and in meaning, that can be rendered"
131,PREFACE.,"in English verse. There still, however, seems an aspect Homeric poems,"
132,PREFACE.,"and a demand in connection with Homer to be recognised, and to be"
133,PREFACE.,satisfied.
134,PREFACE.,
135,PREFACE.,"Sainte-Beuve says, with reference probably to M. Leconte de Lisle’s"
136,PREFACE.,"prose version of the epics, that some people treat the epics too much"
137,PREFACE.,"as if they were sagas. Now the Homeric epics are sagas, but then they"
138,PREFACE.,"are the sagas of the divine heroic age of Greece, and thus are told"
139,PREFACE.,with an art which is not the art of the Northern poets. The epics are
140,PREFACE.,stories about the adventures of men living in most respects like the
141,PREFACE.,"men of our own race who dwelt in Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden."
142,PREFACE.,"The epics are, in a way, and as far as manners and institutions are"
143,PREFACE.,"concerned, historical documents. Whoever regards them in this way, must"
144,PREFACE.,"wish to read them exactly as they have reached us, without modern"
145,PREFACE.,"ornament, with nothing added or omitted. He must recognise, with Mr."
146,PREFACE.,"Matthew Arnold, that what he now wants, namely, the simple truth about"
147,PREFACE.,"the matter of the poem, can only be given in prose, “for in a verse"
148,PREFACE.,translation no original work is any longer recognisable.” It is for
149,PREFACE.,"this reason that we have attempted to tell once more, in simple prose,"
150,PREFACE.,"the story of Odysseus. We have tried to transfer, not all the truth"
151,PREFACE.,"about the poem, but the historical truth, into English. In this process"
152,PREFACE.,"Homer must lose at least half his charm, his bright and equable speed,"
153,PREFACE.,"the musical current of that narrative, which, like the river of Egypt,"
154,PREFACE.,"flows from an indiscoverable source, and mirrors the temples and the"
155,PREFACE.,"palaces of unforgotten gods and kings. Without this music of verse,"
156,PREFACE.,"only a half truth about Homer can be told, but then it is that half of"
157,PREFACE.,"the truth which, at this moment, it seems most necessary to tell. This"
158,PREFACE.,is the half of the truth that the translators who use verse cannot
159,PREFACE.,"easily tell. They _must_ be adding to Homer, talking with Pope about"
160,PREFACE.,"“tracing the mazy lev’ret o’er the lawn,” or with Mr. Worsley about the"
161,PREFACE.,"islands that are “stars of the blue Aegaean,” or with Dr. Hawtrey about"
162,PREFACE.,"“the earth’s soft arms,” when Homer says nothing at all about the “mazy"
163,PREFACE.,"lev’ret,” or the “stars of the blue Aegaean,” or the “soft arms” of"
164,PREFACE.,earth. It would be impertinent indeed to blame any of these
165,PREFACE.,translations in their place. They give that which the romantic reader
166,PREFACE.,"of poetry, or the student of the age of Anne, looks for in verse; and"
167,PREFACE.,"without tags of this sort, a translation of Homer in verse cannot well"
168,PREFACE.,be made to hold together.
169,PREFACE.,
170,PREFACE.,"There can be then, it appears, no final English translation of Homer."
171,PREFACE.,"In each there must be, in addition to what is Greek and eternal, the"
172,PREFACE.,"element of what is modern, personal, and fleeting. Thus we trust that"
173,PREFACE.,there may be room for “the pale and far-off shadow of a prose
174,PREFACE.,"translation,” of which the aim is limited and humble. A prose"
175,PREFACE.,translation cannot give the movement and the fire of a successful
176,PREFACE.,"translation in verse; it only gathers, as it were, the crumbs which"
177,PREFACE.,"fall from the richer table, only tells the story, without the song. Yet"
178,PREFACE.,"to a prose translation is permitted, perhaps, that close adherence to"
179,PREFACE.,"the archaisms of the epic, which in verse become mere oddities. The"
180,PREFACE.,"double epithets, the recurring epithets of Homer, if rendered into"
181,PREFACE.,"verse, delay and puzzle the reader, as the Greek does not delay or"
182,PREFACE.,"puzzle him. In prose he may endure them, or even care to study them as"
183,PREFACE.,"the survivals of a stage of taste, which is to be found in its prime in"
184,PREFACE.,the sagas. These double and recurring epithets of Homer are a softer
185,PREFACE.,"form of the quaint Northern periphrases, which make the sea the “swan’s"
186,PREFACE.,"bath,” gold, the “dragon’s hoard,” men, the “ring-givers,” and so on."
187,PREFACE.,We do not know whether it is necessary to defend our choice of a
188,PREFACE.,somewhat antiquated prose. Homer has no ideas which cannot be expressed
189,PREFACE.,"in words that are “old and plain,” and to words that are old and plain,"
190,PREFACE.,"and, as a rule, to such terms as, being used by the Translators of the"
191,PREFACE.,"Bible, are still not unfamiliar, we have tried to restrict ourselves."
192,PREFACE.,"It may be objected, that the employment of language which does not come"
193,PREFACE.,"spontaneously to the lips, is an affectation out of place in a version"
194,PREFACE.,"of the Odyssey. To this we may answer that the Greek Epic dialect, like"
195,PREFACE.,"the English of our Bible, was a thing of slow growth and composite"
196,PREFACE.,"nature, that it was never a spoken language, nor, except for certain"
197,PREFACE.,"poetical purposes, a written language. Thus the Biblical English seems"
198,PREFACE.,"as nearly analogous to the Epic Greek, as anything that our tongue has"
199,PREFACE.,to offer.
200,PREFACE.,
201,PREFACE.,The few foot-notes in this book are chiefly intended to make clear some
202,PREFACE.,"passages where there is a choice of reading. The notes at the end,"
203,PREFACE.,"which we would like to have written in the form of essays, and in"
204,PREFACE.,"company with more complete philological and archaeological studies, are"
205,PREFACE.,chiefly meant to elucidate the life of Homer’s men.
206,PREFACE.,
207,PREFACE.,"We have received much help from many friends, and especially from Mr."
208,PREFACE.,"R. W. Raper, Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford and Mr. Gerald Balfour,"
209,PREFACE.,"Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who have aided us with many"
210,PREFACE.,suggestions while the book was passing through the press.
211,PREFACE.,
212,PREFACE.,"In the interpretation of B. i. 411, ii. 191, v. 90, and 471, we have"
213,PREFACE.,"departed from the received view, and followed Mr. Raper, who, however,"
214,PREFACE.,has not been able to read through the proof-sheets further than Book
215,PREFACE.,xii.
216,PREFACE.,
217,PREFACE.,"We have adopted La Roche’s text (Homeri Odyssea, J. La Roche, Leipzig,"

219,PREFACE.,foot-note.

221,PREFACE.,"The Arguments prefixed to the Books are taken, with very slight"

225,PREFACE.,"illustrate the growth of those national legends on which Homer worked,"

232,PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.,"We owe our thanks to the Rev. E. Warre, of Eton College, for certain"
233,PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.,"corrections on nautical points. In particular, he has convinced us that"
234,PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.,"the raft of Odysseus in B. v. is a raft strictly so called, and that it"

245,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
246,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,The _Odyssey_ is generally supposed to be somewhat the later in date of
247,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the two most ancient Greek poems which are concerned with the events
248,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,and consequences of the Trojan war. As to the actual history of that
249,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"war, it may be said that nothing is known. We may conjecture that some"
250,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"contest between peoples of more or less kindred stocks, who occupied"
251,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the isles and the eastern and western shores of the Aegean, left a"
252,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,strong impression on the popular fancy. Round the memories of this
253,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"contest would gather many older legends, myths, and stories, not"
254,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"peculiarly Greek or even “Aryan,” which previously floated unattached,"
255,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,or were connected with heroes whose fame was swallowed up by that of a
256,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"newer generation. It would be the work of minstrels, priests, and"
257,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"poets, as the national spirit grew conscious of itself, to shape all"
258,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,these materials into a definite body of tradition. This is the rule of
259,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"development—first scattered stories, then the union of these into a"
260,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"_national_ legend. The growth of later national legends, which we are"
261,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"able to trace, historically, has generally come about in this fashion."
262,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"To take the best known example, we are able to compare the real history"
263,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,of Charlemagne with the old epic poems on his life and exploits. In
264,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"these poems we find that facts are strangely exaggerated, and"
265,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distorted; that purely fanciful additions are made to the true records,"
266,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,that the more striking events of earlier history are crowded into the
267,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"legend of Charles, that mere fairy tales, current among African as well"
268,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as European peoples, are transmuted into false history, and that the"
269,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,anonymous characters of fairy tales are converted into historical
270,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,personages. We can also watch the process by which feigned genealogies
271,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"were constructed, which connected the princely houses of France with"
272,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the imaginary heroes of the epics. The conclusion is that the poetical
273,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,history of Charlemagne has only the faintest relations to the true
274,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"history. And we are justified in supposing that, quite as little of the"
275,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"real history of events can be extracted from the tale of Troy, as from"
276,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the _Chansons de Geste_.
277,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
278,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"By the time the _Odyssey_ was composed, it is certain that a poet had"
279,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,before him a well-arranged mass of legends and traditions from which he
280,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,might select his materials. The author of the _Iliad_ has an extremely
281,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,full and curiously consistent knowledge of the local traditions of
282,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Greece, the memories which were cherished by Thebans, Pylians, people"
283,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Mycenae, of Argos, and so on. The _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ assume"
284,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"this knowledge in the hearers of the poems, and take for granted some"
285,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"acquaintance with other legends, as with the story of the Argonautic"
286,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Expedition. Now that story itself is a tissue of popular tales,—still"
287,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"current in many distant lands,—but all woven by the Greek genius into"
288,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the history of Iason.
289,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
290,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The history of the return of Odysseus as told in the _Odyssey_, is in"
291,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the same way, a tissue of old _märchen_. These must have existed for an"
292,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,unknown length of time before they gravitated into the cycle of the
293,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,tale of Troy.
294,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
295,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The extraordinary artistic skill with which legends and myths,"
296,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"originally unconnected with each other, are woven into the plot of the"
297,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"_Odyssey_, so that the marvels of savage and barbaric fancy become"
298,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"indispensable parts of an artistic whole, is one of the chief proofs of"
299,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the unity of authorship of that poem. We now go on to sketch the plot,"
300,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,which is a marvel of construction.
301,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
302,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Odysseus was the King of Ithaca, a small and rugged island on the"
303,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"western coast of Greece. When he was but lately married to Penelope,"
304,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and while his only son Telemachus was still an infant, the Trojan war"
305,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"began. It is scarcely necessary to say that the object of this war, as"
306,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"conceived of by the poets, was to win back Helen, the wife of Menelaus,"
307,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Paris, the son of Priam, King of Troy. As Menelaus was the brother"
308,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Agamemnon, the Emperor, so to speak, or recognised chief of the"
309,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"petty kingdoms of Greece, the whole force of these kingdoms was at his"
310,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,disposal. No prince came to the leaguer of Troy from a home more remote
311,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"than that of Odysseus. When Troy was taken, in the tenth year of the"
312,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"war, his homeward voyage was the longest and most perilous."
313,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
314,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,The action of the _Odyssey_ occupies but the last six weeks of the ten
315,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,years during which Odysseus was wandering. Two nights in these six
316,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"weeks are taken up, however, by his own narrative of his adventures (to"
317,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Phaeacians, p. xx) in the previous ten years. With this explanatory"
318,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"narrative we must begin, before coming to the regular action of the"
319,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,poem.
320,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
321,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"After the fall of Troy, Odysseus touched at Ismarus, the city of a"
322,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Thracian people, whom he attacked and plundered, but by whom he was at"
323,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"last repulsed. The north wind then carried his ships to Malea, the"
324,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"extreme southern point of Greece. Had he doubled Malea safely, he would"
325,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"probably have reached Ithaca in a few days, would have found Penelope"
326,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"unvexed by wooers, and Telemachus a boy of ten years old. But this was"
327,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,not to be.
328,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
329,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The “ruinous winds” drove Odysseus and his ships for ten days, and on"
330,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the tenth they touched the land of the Lotus-Eaters, whose flowery food"
331,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"causes sweet forgetfulness. Lotus-land was possibly in Western Libya,"
332,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,but it is more probable that ten days’ voyage from the southern point
333,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Greece, brought Odysseus into an unexplored region of fairy-land."
334,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Egypt, of which Homer had some knowledge, was but five days’ sail from"
335,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,Crete.
336,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
337,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Lotus-land, therefore, being ten days’ sail from Malea, was well over"
338,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the limit of the discovered world. From this country Odysseus went on
339,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"till he reached the land of the lawless Cyclôpes, a pastoral people of"
340,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"giants. Later Greece feigned that the Cyclôpes dwelt near Mount Etna,"
341,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,in Sicily. Homer leaves their place of abode in the vague. Among the
342,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cyclôpes, Odysseus had the adventure on which his whole fortunes"
343,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hinged. He destroyed the eye of the cannibal giant, Polyphemus, a son"
344,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Poseidon, the God of the Sea. To avenge this act, Poseidon drove"
345,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Odysseus wandering for ten long years, and only suffered him to land in"
346,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ithaca, “alone, in evil case, to find troubles in his house.” This is a"
347,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,very remarkable point in the plot. The story of the crafty adventurer
348,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and the blinding of the giant, with the punning device by which the"
349,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hero escaped, exists in the shape of a detached _märchen_ or fairy-tale"
350,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,among races who never heard of Homer. And when we find the story among
351,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Oghuzians, Esthonians, Basques, and Celts, it seems natural to suppose"
352,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that these people did not break a fragment out of the _Odyssey_, but"
353,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,that the author of the _Odyssey_ took possession of a legend out of the
354,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,great traditional store of fiction. From the wide distribution of the
355,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tale, there is reason to suppose that it is older than Homer, and that"
356,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it was not originally told of Odysseus, but was attached to his legend,"
357,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,as floating jests of unknown authorship are attributed to eminent wits.
358,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,It has been remarked with truth that in this episode Odysseus acts out
359,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of character, that he is foolhardy as well as cunning. Yet the author"
360,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the _Odyssey_, so far from merely dove-tailing this story at random"
361,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"into his narrative, has made his whole plot turn on the injury to the"
362,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cyclops. Had he not foolishly exposed himself and his companions, by"
363,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his visit to the Cyclops, Odysseus would never have been driven"
364,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,wandering for ten weary years. The prayers of the blinded Cyclops were
365,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,heard and fulfilled by Poseidon.
366,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
367,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"From the land of the Cyclops, Odysseus and his company sailed to the"
368,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Isle of Aeolus, the king of the winds. This place too is undefined; we"
369,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"only learn that, even with the most favourable gale, it was ten days’"
370,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sail from Ithaca. In the Isle of Aeolus Odysseus abode for a month, and"
371,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"then received from the king a bag in which all the winds were bound,"
372,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,except that which was to waft the hero to his home. This sort of bag
373,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,was probably not unfamiliar to superstitious Greek sailors who had
374,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"dealings with witches, like the modern wise women of the Lapps. The"
375,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"companions of the hero opened the bag when Ithaca was in sight, the"
376,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"winds rushed out, the ships were borne back to the Aeolian Isle, and"
377,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,thence the hero was roughly dismissed by Aeolus. Seven days’ sail
378,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"brought him to Lamos, a city of the cannibal Laestrygonians. Their"
379,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"country, too, is in No-man’s-land, and nothing can be inferred from the"
380,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fact that their fountain was called Artacia, and that there was an"
381,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,Artacia in Cyzicus. In Lamos a very important adventure befel Odysseus.
382,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The cannibals destroyed all his fleet, save one ship, with which he"
383,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,made his escape to the Isle of Circé. Here the enchantress turned part
384,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the crew into swine, but Odysseus, by aid of the god Hermes,"
385,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"redeemed them, and became the lover of Circé. This adventure, like the"
386,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"story of the Cyclops, is a fairy tale of great antiquity. Dr. Gerland,"
387,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in his _Alt Griechische Märchen in der Odyssee_, has shown that the"
388,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"story makes part of the collection of Somadeva, a store of Indian"
389,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tales, of which 1200 A.D. is the approximate date. Circé appears as a"
390,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Yackshini, and is conquered when an adventurer seizes her flute whose"
391,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,magic music turns men into beasts. The Indian Circé had the habit of
392,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,eating the animals into which she transformed men.
393,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
394,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We must suppose that the affairs with the Cicones, the Lotus-eaters,"
395,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Cyclops, Aeolus, and the Laestrygonians, occupied most of the first"
396,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,year after the fall of Troy. A year was then spent in the Isle of
397,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Circé, after which the sailors were eager to make for home. Circé"
398,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"commanded them to go down to Hades, to learn the homeward way from the"
399,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias. The descent into hell, for some"
400,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"similar purpose, is common in the epics of other races, such as the"
401,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Finns, and the South-Sea Islanders. The narrative of Odysseus’s visit"
402,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,to the dead (book xi) is one of the most moving passages in the whole
403,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,poem.
404,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
405,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"From Teiresias Odysseus learned that, if he would bring his companions"
406,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"home, he must avoid injuring the sacred cattle of the Sun, which"
407,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"pastured in the Isle of Thrinacia. If these were harmed, he would"
408,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"arrive in Ithaca alone, or in the words of the Cyclops’s prayer, “in"
409,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"evil plight, with loss of all his company, on board the ship of"
410,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"strangers, to find sorrow in his house.” On returning to the Isle"
411,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Aeaean, Odysseus was warned by Circé of the dangers he would encounter."
412,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"He and his friends set forth, escaped the Sirens (a sort of"
413,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mermaidens), evaded the Clashing Rocks, which close on ships (a fable"
414,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"known to the Aztecs), passed Scylla (the _pieuvre_ of antiquity) with"
415,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"loss of some of the company, and reached Thrinacia, the Isle of the"
416,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Sun. Here the company of Odysseus, constrained by hunger, devoured the"
417,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sacred kine of the Sun, for which offence they were punished by a"
418,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"shipwreck, when all were lost save Odysseus. He floated ten days on a"
419,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"raft, and then reached the isle of the goddess Calypso, who kept him as"
420,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,her lover for eight years.
421,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
422,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,The first two years after the fall of Troy are now accounted for. They
423,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"were occupied, as we have seen, by adventures with the Cicones, the"
424,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Lotus-eaters, the Cyclops, Aeolus, the Laestrygonians, by a year’s"
425,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"residence with Circé, by the descent into Hades, the encounters with"
426,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Sirens, and Scylla, and the fatal sojourn in the isle of Thrinacia."
427,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We leave Odysseus alone, for eight years, consuming his own heart, in"
428,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the island paradise of Calypso.
429,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,
430,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In Ithaca, the hero’s home, things seem to have passed smoothly till"
431,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,about the sixth year after the fall of Troy. Then the men of the
432,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"younger generation, the island chiefs, began to woo Penelope, and to"
433,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"vex her son Telemachus. Laertes, the father of Odysseus, was too old to"
434,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"help, and Penelope only gained time by her famous device of weaving and"
435,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"unweaving the web. The wooers began to put compulsion on the Queen,"
436,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"quartering themselves upon her, devouring her substance, and insulting"
437,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"her by their relations with her handmaids. Thus Penelope pined at home,"
438,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"amidst her wasting possessions. Telemachus fretted in vain, and"
439,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,Odysseus was devoured by grief and home-sickness in the isle of
440,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Calypso. When he had lain there for nigh eight years, the action of the"

449,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,is Pallas Athene; the first book opens with her prayer to Zeus that

451,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Calypso to bid her release Odysseus, while Pallas Athene in the shape"
452,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Mentor, a friend of Odysseus, visits Telemachus in Ithaca. She bids"

657,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,This day is occupied with the recognition of Odysseus by his aged
658,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"father Laertes, and with the futile attempt of the kinsfolk of the"

662,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,The reader has now before him a chronologically arranged sketch of the
663,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"action of the _Odyssey_. It is, perhaps, apparent, even from this bare"
664,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"outline, that the composition is elaborate and artistic, that the"
665,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,threads of the plot are skilfully separated and combined. The germ of
666,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the whole epic is probably the popular tale, known all over the world,"
667,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the warrior who, on his return from a long expedition, has great"
668,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,difficulty in making his prudent wife recognise him. The incident
669,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"occurs as a detached story in China, and in most European countries it"
670,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,is told of a crusader. “We may suppose it to be older than the legend
671,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Troy, and to have gravitated into the cycle of that legend. The"
672,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,years of the hero’s absence are then filled up with adventures (the
673,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cyclops, Circé, the Phaeacians, the Sirens, the descent into hell)"
674,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which exist as scattered tales, or are woven into the more elaborate"
675,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"epics of Gaels, Aztecs, Hindoos, Tartars, South-Sea Islanders, Finns,"
676,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Russians, Scandinavians, and Eskimo. The whole is surrounded with the"
677,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"atmosphere of the kingly age of Greece, and the result is the Odyssey,"
678,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,with that unity of plot and variety of character which must have been
679,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,given by one masterly constructive genius. The date at which the poet
680,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Odyssey lived may be approximately determined by his consistent
681,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"descriptions of a peculiar and definite condition of society, which had"
682,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ceased to exist in the ninth century B.C., and of a stage of art in"
683,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,which Phoenician and Assyrian influences predominated. (_Die Kunst bei
684,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer._ Brunn.) As to the mode of composition, it would not be"
685,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,difficult to show that at least the _a priori_ Wolfian arguments
686,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,against the early use of writing for literary purposes have no longer
687,COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.,the cogency which they were once thought to possess. But this is matter

708,BOOK I.,"men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes"
709,BOOK I.,"he suffered in his heart upon the deep, striving to win his own life"
710,BOOK I.,"and the return of his company. Nay, but even so he saved not his"
711,BOOK I.,"company, though he desired it sore. For through the blindness of their"
712,BOOK I.,"own hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios"
713,BOOK I.,Hyperion: but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these
714,BOOK I.,"things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard"

716,BOOK I.,
717,BOOK I.,"Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home,"
718,BOOK I.,"and had escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving for his"
719,BOOK I.,"wife and for his homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair"
720,BOOK I.,"goddess, in her hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But"
721,BOOK I.,"when now the year had come in the courses of the seasons, wherein the"
722,BOOK I.,"gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca, not even there"
723,BOOK I.,"was he quit of labours, not even among his own; but all the gods had"
724,BOOK I.,"pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike"
725,BOOK I.,"Odysseus, till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now"
726,BOOK I.,"departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered"
727,BOOK I.,"in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and"
728,BOOK I.,some where he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls
729,BOOK I.,"and rams, there he made merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods"
730,BOOK I.,were gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father
731,BOOK I.,"of gods and men began to speak, for he bethought him in his heart of"
732,BOOK I.,"noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew."
733,BOOK I.,Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals:
734,BOOK I.,
735,BOOK I.,"“Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they"
736,BOOK I.,"say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness"
737,BOOK I.,"of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even"
738,BOOK I.,"as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to him the"
739,BOOK I.,"wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return,"
740,BOOK I.,"and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had warned him by"
741,BOOK I.,"the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he"
742,BOOK I.,"should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus"
743,BOOK I.,"shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to"
744,BOOK I.,"man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he"
745,BOOK I.,"prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now"
746,BOOK I.,hath he paid one price for all.”
747,BOOK I.,
748,BOOK I.,"And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: “O father, our"
749,BOOK I.,"father Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a"
750,BOOK I.,death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But
751,BOOK I.,"my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his"
752,BOOK I.,"friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle, where"
753,BOOK I.,"is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and therein a goddess hath"
754,BOOK I.,"her habitation, the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths"
755,BOOK I.,"of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and"
756,BOOK I.,sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow:
757,BOOK I.,and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to
758,BOOK I.,forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but
759,BOOK I.,"the smoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for"
760,BOOK I.,"thee, thine heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! did not"
761,BOOK I.,Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of
762,BOOK I.,sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth
763,BOOK I.,"with him, O Zeus?”"
764,BOOK I.,
765,BOOK I.,"And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her, and said, “My child, what"
766,BOOK I.,"word hath escaped the door of thy lips? Yea, how should I forget divine"
767,BOOK I.,"Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men"
768,BOOK I.,"hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven?"
769,BOOK I.,"Nay, but it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth"
770,BOOK I.,continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops’ sake whom he blinded
771,BOOK I.,"of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst"
772,BOOK I.,"all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys,"
773,BOOK I.,"lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with"
774,BOOK I.,Poseidon. From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker doth not indeed
775,BOOK I.,"slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering from his own country. But"
776,BOOK I.,"come, let us here one and all take good counsel as touching his"
777,BOOK I.,"returning, that he may be got home; so shall Poseidon let go his"
778,BOOK I.,"displeasure, for he will in no wise be able to strive alone against"
779,BOOK I.,"all, in despite of all the deathless gods.”"
780,BOOK I.,
781,BOOK I.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, and said: “O father,"
782,BOOK I.,"our father Cronides, throned in the highest, if indeed this thing is"
783,BOOK I.,"now well pleasing to the blessed gods, that wise Odysseus should return"
784,BOOK I.,"to his own home, let us then speed Hermes the Messenger, the slayer of"
785,BOOK I.,"Argos, to the island of Ogygia. There with all speed let him declare to"
786,BOOK I.,"the lady of the braided tresses our unerring counsel, even the return"
787,BOOK I.,"of the patient Odysseus, that so he may come to his home. But as for me"
788,BOOK I.,"I will go to Ithaca that I may rouse his son yet the more, planting"
789,BOOK I.,"might in his heart, to call an assembly of the long-haired Achaeans and"
790,BOOK I.,speak out to all the wooers who slaughter continually the sheep of his
791,BOOK I.,"thronging flocks, and his kine with trailing feet and shambling gait."
792,BOOK I.,And I will guide him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of
793,BOOK I.,"his dear father’s return, if peradventure he may hear thereof and that"
794,BOOK I.,so he may be had in good report among men.”
795,BOOK I.,
796,BOOK I.,She spake and bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax
797,BOOK I.,"not old, and bare her alike over the wet sea and over the limitless"
798,BOOK I.,"land, swift as the breath of the wind. And she seized her doughty"
799,BOOK I.,"spear, shod with sharp bronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith"
800,BOOK I.,"she quells the ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth, the"
801,BOOK I.,daughter of the mighty sire. Then from the heights of Olympus she came
802,BOOK I.,"glancing down, and she stood in the land of Ithaca, at the entry of the"
803,BOOK I.,"gate of Odysseus, on the threshold of the courtyard, holding in her"
804,BOOK I.,"hand the spear of bronze, in the semblance of a stranger, Mentes the"
805,BOOK I.,captain of the Taphians. And there she found the lordly wooers: now
806,BOOK I.,"they were taking their pleasure at draughts in front of the doors,"
807,BOOK I.,"sitting on hides of oxen, which themselves had slain. And of the"
808,BOOK I.,"henchmen and the ready squires, some were mixing for them wine and"
809,BOOK I.,"water in bowls, and some again were washing the tables with porous"
810,BOOK I.,"sponges and were setting them forth, and others were carving flesh in"
811,BOOK I.,plenty.
812,BOOK I.,
813,BOOK I.,"And godlike Telemachus was far the first to descry her, for he was"
814,BOOK I.,sitting with a heavy heart among the wooers dreaming on his good
815,BOOK I.,"father, if haply he might come somewhence, and make a scattering of the"
816,BOOK I.,"wooers there throughout the palace, and himself get honour and bear"
817,BOOK I.,"rule among his own possessions. Thinking thereupon, as he sat among"
818,BOOK I.,"wooers, he saw Athene—and he went straight to the outer porch, for he"
819,BOOK I.,thought it blame in his heart that a stranger should stand long at the
820,BOOK I.,gates: and halting nigh her he clasped her right hand and took from her
821,BOOK I.,"the spear of bronze, and uttered his voice and spake unto her winged"
822,BOOK I.,words:
823,BOOK I.,
824,BOOK I.,"“Hail, stranger, with us thou shalt be kindly entreated, and"
825,BOOK I.,"thereafter, when thou hast tasted meat, thou shalt tell us that whereof"
826,BOOK I.,thou hast need.”
827,BOOK I.,
828,BOOK I.,"Therewith he led the way, and Pallas Athene followed. And when they"
829,BOOK I.,"were now within the lofty house, he set her spear that he bore against"
830,BOOK I.,"a tall pillar, within the polished spear-stand, where stood many spears"
831,BOOK I.,"besides, even those of Odysseus of the hardy heart; and he led the"
832,BOOK I.,"goddess and seated her on a goodly carven chair, and spread a linen"
833,BOOK I.,"cloth thereunder, and beneath was a footstool for the feet. For himself"
834,BOOK I.,"he placed an inlaid seat hard by, apart from the company of the wooers,"
835,BOOK I.,lest the stranger should be disquieted by the noise and should have a
836,BOOK I.,"loathing for the meal, being come among overweening men, and also that"
837,BOOK I.,he might ask him about his father that was gone from his home.
838,BOOK I.,
839,BOOK I.,Then a handmaid bare water for the washing of hands in a goodly golden
840,BOOK I.,"ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal, and drew"
841,BOOK I.,to their side a polished table. And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and
842,BOOK I.,"set it by them, and laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of"
843,BOOK I.,such things as she had by her. And a carver lifted and placed by them
844,BOOK I.,"platters of divers kinds of flesh, and nigh them he set golden bowls,"
845,BOOK I.,and a henchman walked to and fro pouring out to them the wine.
846,BOOK I.,
847,BOOK I.,Then in came the lordly wooers; and they sat them down in rows on
848,BOOK I.,"chairs, and on high seats, and henchmen poured water on their hands,"
849,BOOK I.,"and maidservants piled wheaten bread by them in baskets, and pages"
850,BOOK I.,crowned the bowls with drink; and they stretched forth their hands upon
851,BOOK I.,the good cheer spread before them. Now when the wooers had put from
852,BOOK I.,"them the desire of meat and drink, they minded them of other things,"
853,BOOK I.,even of the song and dance: for these are the crown of the feast. And a
854,BOOK I.,"henchman placed a beauteous lyre in the hands of Phemius, who was"
855,BOOK I.,minstrel to the wooers despite his will. Yea and as he touched the lyre
856,BOOK I.,he lifted up his voice in sweet songs.[1]
857,BOOK I.,
858,BOOK I.,"[1] Or, according to the ordinary interpretation of ἀνεβάλλετο: So he"
859,BOOK I.,touched the chords in prelude to his sweet singing.
860,BOOK I.,
861,BOOK I.,
862,BOOK I.,"But Telemachus spake unto grey-eyed Athene, holding his head close to"
863,BOOK I.,"her that those others might not hear: “Dear stranger, wilt thou of a"
864,BOOK I.,truth be wroth at the word that I shall say? Yonder men verily care for
865,BOOK I.,"such things as these, the lyre and song, lightly, as they that devour"
866,BOOK I.,"the livelihood of another without atonement, of that man whose white"
867,BOOK I.,"bones, it may be, lie wasting in the rain upon the mainland, or the"
868,BOOK I.,billow rolls them in the brine. Were but these men to see him returned
869,BOOK I.,"to Ithaca, they all would pray rather for greater speed of foot than"
870,BOOK I.,"for gain of gold and raiment. But now he hath perished, even so, an"
871,BOOK I.,"evil doom, and for us is no comfort, no, not though any of earthly men"
872,BOOK I.,should say that he will come again. Gone is the day of his returning!
873,BOOK I.,"But come declare me this, and tell me all plainly: Who art thou of the"
874,BOOK I.,"sons of men, and whence? Where is thy city, where are they that begat"
875,BOOK I.,"thee? Say, on what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors"
876,BOOK I.,"bring thee to Ithaca, and who did they avow themselves to be, for in"
877,BOOK I.,nowise do I deem that thou camest hither by land. And herein tell me
878,BOOK I.,"true, that I may know for a surety whether thou art a newcomer, or"
879,BOOK I.,"whether thou art a guest of the house, seeing that many were the"
880,BOOK I.,"strangers that came to our home, for that _he_ too had voyaged much"
881,BOOK I.,among men.”
882,BOOK I.,
883,BOOK I.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Yea now, I will"
884,BOOK I.,"plainly tell thee all. I avow me to be Mentes, son of wise Anchialus,"
885,BOOK I.,"and I bear rule among the Taphians, lovers of the oar. And now am I"
886,BOOK I.,"come to shore, as thou seest, with ship and crew, sailing over the"
887,BOOK I.,"wine-dark sea, unto men of strange speech, even to Temesa,[2] in quest"
888,BOOK I.,"of copper, and my cargo is shining iron. And there my ship is lying"
889,BOOK I.,"toward the upland, away from the city, in the harbour of Rheithron"
890,BOOK I.,beneath wooded Neïon: and we declare ourselves to be friends one of the
891,BOOK I.,"other, and of houses friendly, from of old. Nay, if thou wouldest be"
892,BOOK I.,"assured, go ask the old man, the hero Laertes, who they say no more"
893,BOOK I.,"comes to the city, but far away toward the upland suffers affliction,"
894,BOOK I.,"with an ancient woman for his handmaid, who sets by him meat and drink,"
895,BOOK I.,"whensoever weariness takes hold of his limbs, as he creeps along the"
896,BOOK I.,knoll of his vineyard plot. And now am I come; for verily they said
897,BOOK I.,"that _he_, thy father, was among his people; but lo, the gods withhold"
898,BOOK I.,him from his way. For goodly Odysseus hath not yet perished on the
899,BOOK I.,"earth; but still, methinks, he lives and is kept on the wide deep in a"
900,BOOK I.,"seagirt isle, and hard men constrain him, wild folk that hold him, it"
901,BOOK I.,"may be, sore against his will. But now of a truth will I utter my word"
902,BOOK I.,"of prophecy, as the Immortals bring it into my heart and as I deem it"
903,BOOK I.,"will be accomplished, though no soothsayer am I, nor skilled in the"
904,BOOK I.,signs of birds. Henceforth indeed for no long while shall he be far
905,BOOK I.,"from his own dear country, not though bonds of iron bind him; he will"
906,BOOK I.,"advise him of a way to return, for he is a man of many devices. But"
907,BOOK I.,"come, declare me this, and tell me all plainly, whether indeed, so tall"
908,BOOK I.,"as thou art, thou art sprung from the loins of Odysseus. Thy head"
909,BOOK I.,"surely and they beauteous eyes are wondrous like to his, since full"
910,BOOK I.,"many a time have we held converse together ere he embarked for Troy,"
911,BOOK I.,"whither the others, aye the bravest of the Argives, went in hollow"
912,BOOK I.,"ships. From that day forth neither have I seen Odysseus, nor he me.”"

914,BOOK I.,"[2] Tamasia, in the mountainous centre of Cyprus."
915,BOOK I.,
916,BOOK I.,
917,BOOK I.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, and said: “Yea, sir, now will I"
918,BOOK I.,plainly tell thee all. My mother verily saith that I am his; for myself
919,BOOK I.,"I know not, for never man yet knew of himself his own descent. O that I"
920,BOOK I.,"had been the son of some blessed man, whom old age overtook among his"
921,BOOK I.,"own possessions! But now of him that is the most hapless of mortal men,"
922,BOOK I.,"his son they say that I am, since thou dost question me hereof.”"
923,BOOK I.,
924,BOOK I.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake unto him, and said: “Surely"
925,BOOK I.,"no nameless lineage have the gods ordained for thee in days to come,"
926,BOOK I.,"since Penelope bore thee so goodly a man. But come, declare me this,"
927,BOOK I.,"and tell it all plainly. What feast, nay, what rout is this? What hast"
928,BOOK I.,"thou to do therewith? Is it a clan drinking, or a wedding feast, for"
929,BOOK I.,"here we have no banquet where each man brings his share? In such wise,"
930,BOOK I.,"flown with insolence, do they seem to me to revel wantonly through the"
931,BOOK I.,"house: and well might any man be wroth to see so many deeds of shame,"
932,BOOK I.,whatso wise man came among them.”
933,BOOK I.,
934,BOOK I.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, and said: “Sir, forasmuch as thou"
935,BOOK I.,"questionest me of these things and inquirest thereof, our house was"
936,BOOK I.,"once like to have been rich and honourable, while yet that man was"
937,BOOK I.,"among his people. But now the gods willed it otherwise, in evil"
938,BOOK I.,"purpose, who have made him pass utterly out of sight as no man ever"
939,BOOK I.,"before. Truly I would not even for his death make so great sorrow, had"
940,BOOK I.,"he fallen among his fellows in the land of the Trojans, or in the arms"
941,BOOK I.,of his friends when he had wound up the clew of war. Then would the
942,BOOK I.,"whole Achaean host have builded him a barrow, and even for his son"
943,BOOK I.,would he have won great glory in the after days. But now the spirits of
944,BOOK I.,"the storm have swept him away inglorious. He is gone, lost to sight and"
945,BOOK I.,"hearsay, but for me hath he left anguish and lamentation; nor"
946,BOOK I.,"henceforth is it for him alone that I mourn and weep, since the gods"
947,BOOK I.,have wrought for me other sore distress. For all the noblest that are
948,BOOK I.,"princes in the isles, in Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus, and"
949,BOOK I.,"as many as lord it in rocky Ithaca, all these woo my mother and waste"
950,BOOK I.,"my house. But as for her she neither refuseth the hated bridal, nor"
951,BOOK I.,"hath the heart to make an end: so they devour and minish my house, and"
952,BOOK I.,ere long will they make havoc likewise of myself.”
953,BOOK I.,
954,BOOK I.,Then in heavy displeasure spake unto him Pallas Athene: “God help thee!
955,BOOK I.,"thou art surely sore in need of Odysseus that is afar, to stretch forth"
956,BOOK I.,his hands upon the shameless wooers. If he could but come now and stand
957,BOOK I.,"at the entering in of the gate, with helmet and shield and lances"
958,BOOK I.,"twain, as mighty a man as when first I marked him in our house drinking"
959,BOOK I.,and making merry what time he came up out of Ephyra from Ilus son of
960,BOOK I.,Mermerus! For even thither had Odysseus gone on his swift ship to seek
961,BOOK I.,"a deadly drug, that he might have wherewithal to smear his bronze-shod"
962,BOOK I.,"arrows: but Ilus would in nowise give it to him, for he had in awe the"
963,BOOK I.,"everliving gods. But my father gave it him, for he bare him wondrous"
964,BOOK I.,love. O that Odysseus might in such strength consort with the wooers:
965,BOOK I.,so should they all have swift fate and bitter wedlock! Howbeit these
966,BOOK I.,"things surely lie on the knees of the gods, whether he shall return or"
967,BOOK I.,"not, and take vengeance in his halls. But I charge thee to take counsel"
968,BOOK I.,"how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall. Come now, mark"
969,BOOK I.,and take heed unto my words. On the morrow call the Achaean lords to
970,BOOK I.,"the assembly, and declare thy saying to all, and take the gods to"
971,BOOK I.,"witness. As for the wooers bid them scatter them each one to his own,"
972,BOOK I.,"and for thy mother, if her heart is moved to marriage, let her go back"
973,BOOK I.,"to the hall of that mighty man her father, and her kinsfolk will"
974,BOOK I.,"furnish a wedding feast, and array the gifts of wooing exceeding many,"
975,BOOK I.,all that should go back with a daughter dearly beloved. And to thyself
976,BOOK I.,"I will give a word of wise counsel, if perchance thou wilt hearken. Fit"
977,BOOK I.,"out a ship, the best thou hast, with twenty oarsmen, and go to inquire"
978,BOOK I.,"concerning thy father that is long afar, if perchance any man shall"
979,BOOK I.,"tell thee aught, or if thou mayest hear the voice from Zeus, which"
980,BOOK I.,chiefly brings tidings to men. Get thee first to Pylos and inquire of
981,BOOK I.,"goodly Nestor, and from thence to Sparta to Menelaus of the fair hair,"
982,BOOK I.,for he came home the last of the mail-coated Achaeans. If thou shalt
983,BOOK I.,"hear news of the life and the returning of thy father, then verily thou"
984,BOOK I.,mayest endure the wasting for yet a year. But if thou shalt hear that
985,BOOK I.,"he is dead and gone, return then to thine own dear country and pile his"
986,BOOK I.,"mound, and over it pay burial rites, full many as is due, and give thy"
987,BOOK I.,"mother to a husband. But when thou hast done this and made an end,"
988,BOOK I.,"thereafter take counsel in thy mind and heart, how thou mayest slay the"
989,BOOK I.,"wooers in thy halls, whether by guile or openly; for thou shouldest not"
990,BOOK I.,"carry childish thoughts, being no longer of years thereto. Or hast thou"
991,BOOK I.,not heard what renown the goodly Orestes gat him among all men in that
992,BOOK I.,"he slew the slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus, who killed his"
993,BOOK I.,"famous sire? And thou, too, my friend, for I see that thou art very"
994,BOOK I.,"comely and tall, be valiant, that even men unborn may praise thee. But"
995,BOOK I.,"I will now go down to the swift ship and to my men, who methinks chafe"
996,BOOK I.,much at tarrying for me; and do thou thyself take heed and give ear
997,BOOK I.,unto my words.”
998,BOOK I.,
999,BOOK I.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “Sir, verily thou speakest"
1000,BOOK I.,"these things out of a friendly heart, as a father to his son, and never"
1001,BOOK I.,"will I forget them. But now I pray thee abide here, though eager to be"
1002,BOOK I.,"gone, to the end that after thou hast bathed and had all thy heart’s"
1003,BOOK I.,"desire, thou mayest wend to the ship joyful in spirit, with a costly"
1004,BOOK I.,"gift and very goodly, to be an heirloom of my giving, such as dear"
1005,BOOK I.,friends give to friends.”
1006,BOOK I.,
1007,BOOK I.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Hold me now no"
1008,BOOK I.,"longer, that am eager for the way. But whatsoever gift thine heart"
1009,BOOK I.,"shall bid thee give me, when I am on my way back let it be mine to"
1010,BOOK I.,"carry home: bear from thy stores a gift right goodly, and it shall"
1011,BOOK I.,bring thee the worth thereof in return.”
1012,BOOK I.,
1013,BOOK I.,"So spake she and departed, the grey-eyed Athene, and like an eagle of"
1014,BOOK I.,"the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she planted might and courage,"
1015,BOOK I.,and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore. And he
1016,BOOK I.,"marked the thing and was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god; and"
1017,BOOK I.,"anon he went among the wooers, a godlike man."
1018,BOOK I.,
1019,BOOK I.,"Now the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers, and they sat"
1020,BOOK I.,listening in silence; and his song was of the pitiful return of the
1021,BOOK I.,"Achaeans, that Pallas Athene laid on them as they came forth from Troy."
1022,BOOK I.,"And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,"
1023,BOOK I.,"caught the glorious strain, and she went down the high stairs from her"
1024,BOOK I.,"chamber, not alone, for two of her handmaids bare her company. Now when"
1025,BOOK I.,"the fair lady had come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the"
1026,BOOK I.,well-builded roof holding up her glistening tire before her face; and a
1027,BOOK I.,"faithful maiden stood on either side her. Then she fell a weeping, and"
1028,BOOK I.,spake unto the divine minstrel:
1029,BOOK I.,
1030,BOOK I.,"“Phemius, since thou knowest many other charms for mortals, deeds of"
1031,BOOK I.,"men and gods, which bards rehearse, some one of these do thou sing as"
1032,BOOK I.,"thou sittest by them, and let them drink their wine in silence; but"
1033,BOOK I.,"cease from this pitiful strain, that ever wastes my heart within my"
1034,BOOK I.,"breast, since to me above all women hath come a sorrow comfortless. So"
1035,BOOK I.,"dear a head do I long for in constant memory, namely, that man whose"
1036,BOOK I.,fame is noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos.”
1037,BOOK I.,
1038,BOOK I.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, and said: “O my mother, why then"
1039,BOOK I.,dost thou grudge the sweet minstrel to gladden us as his spirit moves
1040,BOOK I.,"him? It is not minstrels who are in fault, but Zeus, methinks, is in"
1041,BOOK I.,"fault, who gives to men, that live by bread, to each one as he will. As"
1042,BOOK I.,for him it is no blame if he sings the ill-faring of the Danaans; for
1043,BOOK I.,"men always prize that song the most, which rings newest in their ears."
1044,BOOK I.,"But let thy heart and mind endure to listen, for not Odysseus only lost"
1045,BOOK I.,"in Troy the day of his returning, but many another likewise perished."
1046,BOOK I.,"Howbeit go to thy chamber and mind thine own housewiferies, the loom"
1047,BOOK I.,"and distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks. But speech shall be"
1048,BOOK I.,"for men, for all, but for me in chief; for mine is the lordship in the"
1049,BOOK I.,house.”
1050,BOOK I.,
1051,BOOK I.,"Then in amaze she went back to her chamber, for she laid up the wise"
1052,BOOK I.,saying of her son in her heart. She ascended to her upper chamber with
1053,BOOK I.,"the women her handmaids, and then was bewailing Odysseus, her dear"
1054,BOOK I.,"lord, till grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids."
1055,BOOK I.,
1056,BOOK I.,"Now the wooers clamoured throughout the shadowy halls, and each one"
1057,BOOK I.,uttered a prayer to be her bedfellow. And wise Telemachus first spake
1058,BOOK I.,among them:
1059,BOOK I.,
1060,BOOK I.,"“Wooers of my mother, men despiteful out of measure, let us feast now"
1061,BOOK I.,"and make merry and let there be no brawling; for, lo, it is a good"
1062,BOOK I.,"thing to list to a minstrel such as him, like to the gods in voice. But"
1063,BOOK I.,"in the morning let us all go to the assembly and sit us down, that I"
1064,BOOK I.,"may declare my saying outright, to wit that ye leave these halls: and"
1065,BOOK I.,"busy yourselves with other feasts, eating your own substance, going in"
1066,BOOK I.,turn from house to house. But if ye deem this a likelier and a better
1067,BOOK I.,"thing, that one man’s goods should perish without atonement, then waste"
1068,BOOK I.,"ye as ye will; and I will call upon the everlasting gods, if haply Zeus"
1069,BOOK I.,may grant that acts of recompense be made: so should ye hereafter
1070,BOOK I.,perish within the halls without atonement.”
1071,BOOK I.,
1072,BOOK I.,"So spake he, and all that heard him bit their lips and marvelled at"
1073,BOOK I.,"Telemachus, in that he spake boldly."
1074,BOOK I.,
1075,BOOK I.,"Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Telemachus, in very"
1076,BOOK I.,truth the gods themselves instruct thee to be proud of speech and
1077,BOOK I.,"boldly to harangue. Never may Cronion make thee king in seagirt Ithaca,"
1078,BOOK I.,which thing is of inheritance thy right!”
1079,BOOK I.,
1080,BOOK I.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: “Antinous, wilt thou"
1081,BOOK I.,"indeed be wroth at the word that I shall say? Yea, at the hand of Zeus"
1082,BOOK I.,would I be fain to take even this thing upon me. Sayest thou that this
1083,BOOK I.,"is the worst hap that can befal a man? Nay, verily, it is no ill thing"
1084,BOOK I.,to be a king: the house of such an one quickly waxeth rich and himself
1085,BOOK I.,is held in greater honour. Howsoever there are many other kings of the
1086,BOOK I.,"Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca, kings young and old; someone of them shall"
1087,BOOK I.,"surely have this kingship since goodly Odysseus is dead. But as for me,"
1088,BOOK I.,"I will be lord of our own house and thralls, that goodly Odysseus gat"
1089,BOOK I.,me with his spear.”
1090,BOOK I.,
1091,BOOK I.,"Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, saying: “Telemachus, on"
1092,BOOK I.,"the knees of the gods it surely lies, what man is to be king over the"
1093,BOOK I.,Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca. But mayest thou keep thine own possessions
1094,BOOK I.,"and be lord in thine own house! Never may that man come, who shall"
1095,BOOK I.,wrest from thee thy substance violently in thine own despite while
1096,BOOK I.,"Ithaca yet stands. But I would ask thee, friend, concerning the"
1097,BOOK I.,"stranger—whence he is, and of what land he avows him to be? Where are"
1098,BOOK I.,his kin and his native fields? Doth he bear some tidings of thy father
1099,BOOK I.,"on his road, or cometh he thus to speed some matter of his own? In such"
1100,BOOK I.,"wise did he start up, and lo, he was gone, nor tarried he that we"
1101,BOOK I.,should know him;—and yet he seemed no mean man to look upon.”[3]
1102,BOOK I.,
1103,BOOK I.,[3] The γὰρ explains the expression of surprise at the sudden
1104,BOOK I.,departure of the stranger.
1105,BOOK I.,
1106,BOOK I.,
1107,BOOK I.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: “Eurymachus, surely the"
1108,BOOK I.,day of my father’s returning hath gone by. Therefore no more do I put
1109,BOOK I.,"faith in tidings, whencesoever they may come, neither have I regard"
1110,BOOK I.,"unto any divination, whereof my mother may inquire at the lips of a"
1111,BOOK I.,"diviner, when she hath bidden him to the hall. But as for that man, he"
1112,BOOK I.,"is a friend of my house from Taphos, and he avows him to be Mentes, son"
1113,BOOK I.,"of wise Anchialus, and he hath lordship among the Taphians, lovers of"
1114,BOOK I.,the oar.”
1115,BOOK I.,
1116,BOOK I.,"So spake Telemachus, but in his heart he knew the deathless goddess."
1117,BOOK I.,"Now the wooers turned them to the dance and the delightsome song, and"
1118,BOOK I.,"made merry, and waited till evening should come on. And as they made"
1119,BOOK I.,"merry, dusk evening came upon them. Then they went each one to his own"
1120,BOOK I.,house to lie down to rest.
1121,BOOK I.,
1122,BOOK I.,"But Telemachus, where his chamber was builded high up in the fair"
1123,BOOK I.,"court, in a place with wide prospect, thither betook him to his bed,"
1124,BOOK I.,pondering many thoughts in his mind; and with him went trusty
1125,BOOK I.,"Eurycleia, and bare for him torches burning. She was the daughter of"
1126,BOOK I.,"Ops, son of Peisenor, and Laertes bought her on a time with his wealth,"
1127,BOOK I.,"while as yet she was in her first youth, and gave for her the worth of"
1128,BOOK I.,twenty oxen. And he honoured her even as he honoured his dear wife in
1129,BOOK I.,"the halls, but he never lay with her, for he shunned the wrath of his"
1130,BOOK I.,lady. She went with Telemachus and bare for him the burning torches:
1131,BOOK I.,"and of all the women of the household she loved him most, and she had"
1132,BOOK I.,nursed him when a little one. Then he opened the doors of the
1133,BOOK I.,well-builded chamber and sat him on the bed and took off his soft
1134,BOOK I.,"doublet, and put it in the wise old woman’s hands. So she folded the"
1135,BOOK I.,"doublet and smoothed it, and hung it on a pin by the jointed bedstead,"
1136,BOOK I.,"and went forth on her way from the room, and pulled to the door with"
1137,BOOK I.,"the silver handle, and drew home the bar with the thong. There, all"
1138,BOOK I.,"night through, wrapped in a fleece of wool, he meditated in his heart"
1139,BOOK I.,upon the journey that Athene had showed him.
1140,BOOK I.,
1141,BOOK I.,
1142,BOOK I.,
1143,BOOK II.,BOOK II.
1144,BOOK II.,
1145,BOOK II.,
1146,BOOK II.,"Telemachus complains in vain, and borrowing a ship, goes secretly to"
1147,BOOK II.,Pylos by night. And how he was there received.
1148,BOOK II.,
1149,BOOK II.,
1150,BOOK II.,"Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, the dear son"
1151,BOOK II.,"of Odysseus gat him up from his bed, and put on his raiment and cast"
1152,BOOK II.,"his sharp sword about his shoulder, and beneath his smooth feet he"
1153,BOOK II.,"bound his goodly sandals, and stept forth from his chamber in presence"
1154,BOOK II.,like a god. And straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to call
1155,BOOK II.,the long-haired Achaeans to the assembly. And the heralds called the
1156,BOOK II.,"gathering, and the Achaeans were assembled quickly. Now when they were"
1157,BOOK II.,"gathered and come together, he went on his way to the assembly holding"
1158,BOOK II.,"in his hand a spear of bronze,—not alone he went, for two swift hounds"
1159,BOOK II.,"bare him company. Then Athene shed on him a wondrous grace, and all the"
1160,BOOK II.,people marvelled at him as he came. And he sat him in his father’s seat
1161,BOOK II.,and the elders gave place to him.
1162,BOOK II.,
1163,BOOK II.,"Then the lord Aegyptus spake among them first; bowed was he with age,"
1164,BOOK II.,and skilled in things past number. Now for this reason he spake that
1165,BOOK II.,"his dear son, the warrior Antiphus, had gone in the hollow ships to"
1166,BOOK II.,Ilios of the goodly steeds; but the savage Cyclops slew him in his
1167,BOOK II.,"hollow cave, and made of him then his latest meal. Three other sons"
1168,BOOK II.,"Aegyptus had, and one consorted with the wooers, namely Eurynomus, but"
1169,BOOK II.,two continued in their father’s fields; yet even so forgat he not that
1170,BOOK II.,"son, still mourning and sorrowing. So weeping for his sake he made"
1171,BOOK II.,harangue and spake among them:
1172,BOOK II.,
1173,BOOK II.,"“Hearken now to me, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say."
1174,BOOK II.,Never hath our assembly or session been since the day that goodly
1175,BOOK II.,Odysseus departed in the hollow ships. And now who was minded thus to
1176,BOOK II.,"assemble us? On what man hath such sore need come, of the young men or"
1177,BOOK II.,of the elder born? Hath he heard some tidings of the host now
1178,BOOK II.,"returning, which he might plainly declare to us, for that he first"
1179,BOOK II.,"learned thereof, or doth he show forth and tell some other matter of"
1180,BOOK II.,the common weal? Methinks he is a true man—good luck be with him! Zeus
1181,BOOK II.,"vouchsafe him some good thing in his turn, even all his heart’s"
1182,BOOK II.,desire!”
1183,BOOK II.,
1184,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and the dear son of Odysseus was glad at the omen of the"
1185,BOOK II.,"word; nor sat he now much longer, but he burned to speak, and he stood"
1186,BOOK II.,"in mid assembly; and the herald Peisenor, skilled in sage counsels,"
1187,BOOK II.,"placed the staff in his hands. Then he spake, accosting the old man"
1188,BOOK II.,first:
1189,BOOK II.,
1190,BOOK II.,"“Old man, he is not far off, and soon shalt thou know it for thyself,"
1191,BOOK II.,"he who called the folk together, even I: for sorrow hath come to me in"
1192,BOOK II.,"chief. Neither have I heard any tidings of the host now returning,"
1193,BOOK II.,"which I may plainly declare to you, for that I first learned thereof;"
1194,BOOK II.,"neither do I show forth or tell any other matter of the common weal,"
1195,BOOK II.,"but mine own need, for that evil hath befallen my house, a double woe."
1196,BOOK II.,"First, I have lost my noble sire, who sometime was king among you here,"
1197,BOOK II.,"and was gentle as a father; and now is there an evil yet greater far,"
1198,BOOK II.,which surely shall soon make grievous havoc of my whole house and ruin
1199,BOOK II.,all my livelihood. My mother did certain wooers beset sore against her
1200,BOOK II.,"will, even the sons of those men that here are the noblest. They are"
1201,BOOK II.,"too craven to go to the house of her father Icarius, that he may"
1202,BOOK II.,"himself set the bride-price for his daughter, and bestow her on whom he"
1203,BOOK II.,"will, even on him who finds favour in his sight. But they resorting to"
1204,BOOK II.,"our house day by day sacrifice oxen and sheep and fat goats, and keep"
1205,BOOK II.,"revel, and drink the dark wine recklessly, and lo, our great wealth is"
1206,BOOK II.,"wasted, for there is no man now alive such as Odysseus was, to keep"
1207,BOOK II.,ruin from the house. As for me I am nowise strong like him to ward mine
1208,BOOK II.,own; verily to the end of my days[4] shall I be a weakling and all
1209,BOOK II.,unskilled in prowess. Truly I would defend me if but strength were
1210,BOOK II.,"mine; for deeds past sufferance have now been wrought, and now my house"
1211,BOOK II.,is wasted utterly beyond pretence of right. Resent it in your own
1212,BOOK II.,"hearts, and have regard to your neighbours who dwell around, and"
1213,BOOK II.,"tremble ye at the anger of the gods, lest haply they turn upon you in"
1214,BOOK II.,wrath at your evil deeds.[5]  I pray you by Olympian Zeus and by
1215,BOOK II.,"Themis, who looseth and gathereth the meetings of men, let be, my"
1216,BOOK II.,"friends, and leave me alone to waste in bitter grief;—unless it so be"
1217,BOOK II.,"that my father, the good Odysseus, out of evil heart wrought harm to"
1218,BOOK II.,"the goodly-greaved Achaeans, in quittance whereof ye now work me harm"
1219,BOOK II.,"out of evil hearts, and spur on these men. Better for me that ye"
1220,BOOK II.,yourselves should eat up my treasures and my flocks. Were _ye_ so to
1221,BOOK II.,"devour them, ere long would some recompense be made, for we would urge"
1222,BOOK II.,"our plea throughout the town, begging back our substance, until all"
1223,BOOK II.,should be restored. But now without remedy are the pains that ye lay up
1224,BOOK II.,in my heart.”

1228,BOOK II.,
1229,BOOK II.,
1230,BOOK II.,"[5] Or, lest they bring your evil deeds in wrath on your own heads."
1231,BOOK II.,
1232,BOOK II.,
1233,BOOK II.,"So spake he in wrath, and dashed the staff to the ground, and brake"
1234,BOOK II.,forth in tears; and pity fell on all the people. Then all the others
1235,BOOK II.,"held their peace, and none had the heart to answer Telemachus with hard"
1236,BOOK II.,"words, but Antinous alone made answer, saying:"
1237,BOOK II.,
1238,BOOK II.,"“Telemachus, proud of speech and unrestrained in fury, what is this"
1239,BOOK II.,"thou hast said to put us to shame, and wouldest fasten on us reproach?"
1240,BOOK II.,"Behold the fault is not in the Achaean wooers, but in thine own mother,"
1241,BOOK II.,"for she is the craftiest of women. For it is now the third year, and"
1242,BOOK II.,"the fourth is fast going by, since she began to deceive the minds of"
1243,BOOK II.,"the Achaeans in their breasts. She gives hope to all, and makes"
1244,BOOK II.,"promises to every man, and sends them messages, but her mind is set on"
1245,BOOK II.,other things. And she hath devised in her heart this wile besides; she
1246,BOOK II.,"set up in her halls a mighty web, fine of woof and very wide, whereat"
1247,BOOK II.,"she would weave, and anon she spake among us:"
1248,BOOK II.,
1249,BOOK II.,"“‘Ye princely youths, my wooers, now that the goodly Odysseus is dead,"
1250,BOOK II.,"do ye abide patiently, how eager soever to speed on this marriage of"
1251,BOOK II.,"mine, till I finish the robe. I would not that the threads perish to no"
1252,BOOK II.,"avail, even this shroud for the hero Laertes, against the day when the"
1253,BOOK II.,"ruinous doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at their"
1254,BOOK II.,length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land count it blame
1255,BOOK II.,"in me, as well might be, were he to lie without a winding-sheet, a man"
1256,BOOK II.,that had gotten great possessions.’
1257,BOOK II.,
1258,BOOK II.,"“So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So then in the"
1259,BOOK II.,"day time she would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the"
1260,BOOK II.,"same, when she had let place the torches by her. Thus for the space of"
1261,BOOK II.,three years she hid the thing by craft and beguiled the minds of the
1262,BOOK II.,"Achaeans; but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round,"
1263,BOOK II.,"then at the last one of her women who knew all declared it, and we"
1264,BOOK II.,found her unravelling the splendid web. Thus she finished it perforce
1265,BOOK II.,"and sore against her will. But as for thee, the wooers make thee answer"
1266,BOOK II.,"thus, that thou mayest know it in thine own heart, thou and all the"
1267,BOOK II.,"Achaeans! Send away thy mother, and bid her be married to whomsoever"
1268,BOOK II.,"her father commands, and whoso is well pleasing unto her. But if she"
1269,BOOK II.,"will continue for long to vex the sons of the Achaeans, pondering in"
1270,BOOK II.,"her heart those things that Athene hath given her beyond women,"
1271,BOOK II.,"knowledge of all fair handiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles—so be"
1272,BOOK II.,it! Such wiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the
1273,BOOK II.,"women of old did know, of those that aforetime were fair-tressed"
1274,BOOK II.,"Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene with the bright crown."
1275,BOOK II.,Not one of these in the imaginations of their hearts was like unto
1276,BOOK II.,"Penelope, yet herein at least her imagining was not good. For in"
1277,BOOK II.,"despite of her the wooers will devour thy living and thy substance, so"
1278,BOOK II.,long as she is steadfast in such purpose as the gods now put within her
1279,BOOK II.,"breast: great renown for herself she winneth, but for thee regret for"
1280,BOOK II.,"thy much livelihood. But we will neither go to our own lands, nor"
1281,BOOK II.,"otherwhere, till she marry that man whom she will of the Achaeans.”"
1282,BOOK II.,
1283,BOOK II.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Antinous, I may in no wise"
1284,BOOK II.,"thrust forth from the house, against her will, the woman that bare me,"
1285,BOOK II.,"that reared me: while as for my father he is abroad on the earth,"
1286,BOOK II.,whether he be alive or dead. Moreover it is hard for me to make heavy
1287,BOOK II.,"restitution to Icarius, as needs I must, if of mine own will I send my"
1288,BOOK II.,"mother away. For I shall have evil at his hand, at the hand of her"
1289,BOOK II.,"father, and some god will give me more besides, for my mother will call"
1290,BOOK II.,"down the dire Avengers as she departs from the house, and I shall have"
1291,BOOK II.,"blame of men; surely then I will never speak this word. Nay, if your"
1292,BOOK II.,"own heart, even yours, is indignant, quit ye my halls, and busy"
1293,BOOK II.,"yourselves with other feasts, eating your own substance, and going in"
1294,BOOK II.,turn from house to house. But if ye deem this a likelier and a better
1295,BOOK II.,"thing, that one man’s goods should perish without atonement, then waste"
1296,BOOK II.,"ye as ye will: and I will call upon the everlasting gods, if haply Zeus"
1297,BOOK II.,may grant that acts of recompense be made: so should ye hereafter
1298,BOOK II.,perish in the halls without atonement.”
1299,BOOK II.,
1300,BOOK II.,"So spake Telemachus, and in answer to his prayer did Zeus, of the far"
1301,BOOK II.,"borne voice, send forth two eagles in flight, from on high, from the"
1302,BOOK II.,"mountain-crest. Awhile they flew as fleet as the blasts of the wind,"
1303,BOOK II.,"side by side, with straining of their pinions. But when they had now"
1304,BOOK II.,"reached the mid assembly, the place of many voices, there they wheeled"
1305,BOOK II.,"about and flapped their strong wings, and looked down upon the heads of"
1306,BOOK II.,"all, and destruction was in their gaze. Then tore they with their"
1307,BOOK II.,"talons each the other’s cheeks and neck on every side, and so sped to"
1308,BOOK II.,the right across the dwellings and the city of the people. And the men
1309,BOOK II.,"marvelled at the birds when they had sight of them, and pondered in"
1310,BOOK II.,"their hearts the things that should come to pass. Yea and the old man,"
1311,BOOK II.,"the lord Halitherses son of Mastor spake among them, for he excelled"
1312,BOOK II.,"his peers in knowledge of birds, and in uttering words of fate. With"
1313,BOOK II.,good will he made harangue and spake among them:
1314,BOOK II.,
1315,BOOK II.,"“Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say: and"
1316,BOOK II.,"mainly to the wooers do I show forth and tell these things, seeing that"
1317,BOOK II.,a mighty woe is rolling upon them. For Odysseus shall not long be away
1318,BOOK II.,"from his friends, nay, even now, it may be, he is near, and sowing the"
1319,BOOK II.,"seeds of death and fate for these men, every one; and he will be a bane"
1320,BOOK II.,to many another likewise of us who dwell in clear-seen Ithaca. But long
1321,BOOK II.,ere that falls out let us advise us how we may make an end of their
1322,BOOK II.,"mischief; yea, let them of their own selves make an end, for this is"
1323,BOOK II.,"the better way for them, as will soon be seen. For I prophesy not as"
1324,BOOK II.,"one unproved, but with sure knowledge; verily, I say, that for him all"
1325,BOOK II.,"things now are come to pass, even as I told him, what time the Argives"
1326,BOOK II.,"embarked for Ilios, and with them went the wise Odysseus. I said that"
1327,BOOK II.,"after sore affliction, with the loss of all his company, unknown to"
1328,BOOK II.,"all, in the twentieth year he should come home. And behold, all these"
1329,BOOK II.,things now have an end.”
1330,BOOK II.,
1331,BOOK II.,"And Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, saying: “Go now, old man,"
1332,BOOK II.,"get thee home and prophesy to thine own children, lest haply they"
1333,BOOK II.,suffer harm hereafter: but herein am I a far better prophet than thou.
1334,BOOK II.,"Howbeit there be many birds that fly to and fro under the sun’s rays,"
1335,BOOK II.,"but all are not birds of fate. Now as for Odysseus, he hath perished"
1336,BOOK II.,"far away, as would that thou too with him hadst been cut off: so"
1337,BOOK II.,"wouldst thou not have babbled thus much prophecy, nor wouldst thou"
1338,BOOK II.,"hound on Telemachus that is already angered, expecting a gift for thy"
1339,BOOK II.,"house, if perchance he may vouchsafe thee aught. But now will I speak"
1340,BOOK II.,"out, and my word shall surely be accomplished. If thou that knowest"
1341,BOOK II.,"much lore from of old, shalt beguile with words a younger man, and"
1342,BOOK II.,"rouse him to indignation, first it shall be a great grief to him:—and"
1343,BOOK II.,"yet he can count on no aid from these who hear him;—while upon thee,"
1344,BOOK II.,"old man, we will lay a fine, that thou mayest pay it and chafe at"
1345,BOOK II.,"heart, and sore pain shall be thine. And I myself will give a word of"
1346,BOOK II.,counsel to Telemachus in presence of you all. Let him command his
1347,BOOK II.,mother to return to her father’s house; and her kinsfolk will furnish a
1348,BOOK II.,"wedding feast, and array the gifts of wooing, exceeding many, all that"
1349,BOOK II.,"should go back with a daughter dearly beloved. For ere that, I trow, we"
1350,BOOK II.,"sons of the Achaeans will not cease from our rough wooing, since, come"
1351,BOOK II.,"what may, we fear not any man, no, not Telemachus, full of words though"
1352,BOOK II.,"he be, nor soothsaying do we heed, whereof thou, old man, pratest idly,"
1353,BOOK II.,and art hated yet the more. His substance too shall be woefully
1354,BOOK II.,"devoured, nor shall recompense ever be made, so long as she shall put"
1355,BOOK II.,off the Achaeans in the matter of her marriage; while we in
1356,BOOK II.,"expectation, from day to day, vie one with another for the prize of her"
1357,BOOK II.,"perfection, nor go we after other women whom it were meet that we"
1358,BOOK II.,should each one wed.”
1359,BOOK II.,
1360,BOOK II.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him saying: “Eurymachus, and ye others,"
1361,BOOK II.,"that are lordly wooers, I entreat you no more concerning this nor speak"
1362,BOOK II.,"thereof, for the gods have knowledge of it now and all the Achaeans."
1363,BOOK II.,"But come, give me a swift ship and twenty men, who shall accomplish for"
1364,BOOK II.,me my voyage to and fro. For I will go to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to
1365,BOOK II.,"inquire concerning the return of my father that is long afar, if"
1366,BOOK II.,"perchance any man shall tell me aught, or if I may hear the voice from"
1367,BOOK II.,"Zeus, that chiefly brings tidings to men. If I shall hear news of the"
1368,BOOK II.,"life and the returning of my father, then verily I may endure the"
1369,BOOK II.,"wasting for yet a year; but if I shall hear that he is dead and gone,"
1370,BOOK II.,"let me then return to my own dear country, and pile his mound, and over"
1371,BOOK II.,"it pay burial rites full many as is due, and I will give my mother to a"
1372,BOOK II.,husband.”
1373,BOOK II.,
1374,BOOK II.,"So with that word he sat him down; then in the midst uprose Mentor, the"
1375,BOOK II.,"companion of noble Odysseus. He it was to whom Odysseus, as he departed"
1376,BOOK II.,"in the fleet, had given the charge over all his house, that it should"
1377,BOOK II.,"obey the old man, and that he should keep all things safe. With good"
1378,BOOK II.,will he now made harangue and spake among them:
1379,BOOK II.,
1380,BOOK II.,"“Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say."
1381,BOOK II.,Henceforth let not any sceptred king be kind and gentle with all his
1382,BOOK II.,"heart, nor minded to do righteously, but let him alway be a hard man"
1383,BOOK II.,"and work unrighteousness: for behold, there is none that remembereth"
1384,BOOK II.,"divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was, and was gentle as a"
1385,BOOK II.,"father. Howsoever, it is not that I grudge the lordly wooers their"
1386,BOOK II.,deeds of violence in the evil devices of their heart. For at the hazard
1387,BOOK II.,"of their own heads they violently devour the household of Odysseus, and"
1388,BOOK II.,say of him that he will come no more again. But I am indeed wroth with
1389,BOOK II.,"the rest of the people, to see how ye all sit thus speechless, and do"
1390,BOOK II.,"not cry shame upon the wooers, and put them down, ye that are so many"
1391,BOOK II.,and they so few.”
1392,BOOK II.,
1393,BOOK II.,"And Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him, saying: “Mentor infatuate,"
1394,BOOK II.,"with thy wandering wits, what word hast thou spoken, that callest upon"
1395,BOOK II.,"them to put us down? Nay, it is a hard thing to fight about a feast,"
1396,BOOK II.,and that with men who are even more in number than you. Though Odysseus
1397,BOOK II.,of Ithaca himself should come and were eager of heart to drive forth
1398,BOOK II.,"from the hall the lordly wooers that feast throughout his house, yet"
1399,BOOK II.,"should his wife have no joy of his coming, though she yearns for"
1400,BOOK II.,"him;—but even there should he meet foul doom, if he fought with those"
1401,BOOK II.,that outnumbered him; so thou hast not spoken aright. But as for the
1402,BOOK II.,"people, come now, scatter yourselves each one to his own lands, but"
1403,BOOK II.,"Mentor and Halitherses will speed this man’s voyage, for they are"
1404,BOOK II.,"friends of his house from of old. Yet after all, methinks, that long"
1405,BOOK II.,"time he will abide and seek tidings in Ithaca, and never accomplish"
1406,BOOK II.,this voyage.”
1407,BOOK II.,
1408,BOOK II.,"Thus he spake, and in haste they broke up the assembly. So they were"
1409,BOOK II.,"scattered each one to his own dwelling, while the wooers departed to"
1410,BOOK II.,the house of divine Odysseus.
1411,BOOK II.,
1412,BOOK II.,"Then Telemachus, going far apart to the shore of the sea, laved his"
1413,BOOK II.,"hands in the grey sea water, and prayed unto Athene, saying: “Hear me,"
1414,BOOK II.,"thou who yesterday didst come in thy godhead to our house, and badest"
1415,BOOK II.,"me go in a ship across the misty seas, to seek tidings of the return of"
1416,BOOK II.,my father that is long gone: but all this my purpose do the Achaeans
1417,BOOK II.,"delay, and mainly the wooers in the naughtiness of their pride.”"
1418,BOOK II.,
1419,BOOK II.,"So spake he in prayer, and Athene drew nigh him in the likeness of"
1420,BOOK II.,"Mentor, in fashion and in voice, and she spake and hailed him in winged"
1421,BOOK II.,words:
1422,BOOK II.,
1423,BOOK II.,"“Telemachus, even hereafter thou shalt not be craven or witless, if"
1424,BOOK II.,indeed thou hast a drop of thy father’s blood and a portion of his
1425,BOOK II.,"spirit; such an one was he to fulfil both word and work. Nor, if this"
1426,BOOK II.,"be so, shall thy voyage be vain or unfulfilled. But if thou art not the"
1427,BOOK II.,"very seed of him and of Penelope, then have I no hope that thou wilt"
1428,BOOK II.,"accomplish thy desire. For few children, truly, are like their father;"
1429,BOOK II.,"lo, the more part are worse, yet a few are better than the sire. But"
1430,BOOK II.,"since thou shalt not even hereafter be craven or witless, nor hath the"
1431,BOOK II.,"wisdom of Odysseus failed thee quite, so is there good hope of thine"
1432,BOOK II.,accomplishing this work. Wherefore now take no heed of the counsel or
1433,BOOK II.,"the purpose of the senseless wooers, for they are in no way wise or"
1434,BOOK II.,"just: neither know they aught of death and of black fate, which already"
1435,BOOK II.,"is close upon them, that they are all to perish in one day. But the"
1436,BOOK II.,voyage on which thy heart is set shall not long be lacking to thee—so
1437,BOOK II.,"faithful a friend of thy father am I, who will furnish thee a swift"
1438,BOOK II.,"ship and myself be thy companion. But go thou to the house, and consort"
1439,BOOK II.,"with the wooers, and make ready corn, and bestow all in vessels, the"
1440,BOOK II.,"wine in jars and barley-flour, the marrow of men, in well-sewn skins;"
1441,BOOK II.,and I will lightly gather in the township a crew that offer themselves
1442,BOOK II.,"willingly. There are many ships, new and old, in seagirt Ithaca; of"
1443,BOOK II.,"these I will choose out the best for thee, and we will quickly rig her"
1444,BOOK II.,and launch her on the broad deep.”
1445,BOOK II.,
1446,BOOK II.,"So spake Athene, daughter of Zeus, and Telemachus made no long"
1447,BOOK II.,"tarrying, when he had heard the voice of the goddess. He went on his"
1448,BOOK II.,"way towards the house, heavy at heart, and there he found the noble"
1449,BOOK II.,"wooers in the halls, flaying goats and singeing swine in the court. And"
1450,BOOK II.,"Antinous laughed out and went straight to Telemachus, and clasped his"
1451,BOOK II.,hand and spake and hailed him:
1452,BOOK II.,
1453,BOOK II.,"“Telemachus, proud of speech and unrestrained in fury, let no evil word"
1454,BOOK II.,"any more be in thy heart, nor evil work, but let me see thee eat and"
1455,BOOK II.,drink as of old. And the Achaeans will make thee ready all things
1456,BOOK II.,"without fail, a ship and chosen oarsmen, that thou mayest come the"
1457,BOOK II.,"quicker to fair Pylos, to seek tidings of thy noble father.”"
1458,BOOK II.,
1459,BOOK II.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying, “Antinous, in no wise in"
1460,BOOK II.,"your proud company can I sup in peace, and make merry with a quiet"
1461,BOOK II.,"mind. Is it a little thing, ye wooers, that in time past ye wasted many"
1462,BOOK II.,"good things of my getting, while as yet I was a child? But now that I"
1463,BOOK II.,"am a man grown, and learn the story from the lips of others, and my"
1464,BOOK II.,"spirit waxeth within me, I will seek to let loose upon you evil fates,"
1465,BOOK II.,"as I may, going either to Pylos for help, or abiding here in this"
1466,BOOK II.,"township. Yea, I will go, nor vain shall the voyage be whereof I speak;"
1467,BOOK II.,"a passenger on another’s ship go I, for I am not to have a ship nor"
1468,BOOK II.,oarsmen of mine own; so in your wisdom ye have thought it for the
1469,BOOK II.,better.”
1470,BOOK II.,
1471,BOOK II.,"He spake and snatched his hand from out the hand of Antinous, lightly,"
1472,BOOK II.,and all the while the wooers were busy feasting through the house; and
1473,BOOK II.,"they mocked him and sharply taunted him, and thus would some proud"
1474,BOOK II.,youth speak:
1475,BOOK II.,
1476,BOOK II.,“In very truth Telemachus planneth our destruction. He will bring a
1477,BOOK II.,"rescue either from sandy Pylos, or even it may be from Sparta, so"
1478,BOOK II.,"terribly is he set on slaying us. Or else he will go to Ephyra, a"
1479,BOOK II.,"fruitful land, to fetch a poisonous drug that he may cast it into the"
1480,BOOK II.,bowl and make an end of all of us.”
1481,BOOK II.,
1482,BOOK II.,And again another proud youth would say: “Who knows but that he himself
1483,BOOK II.,"if he goes hence on the hollow ship, may perish wandering far from his"
1484,BOOK II.,"friends, even as Odysseus? So should we have yet more ado, for then"
1485,BOOK II.,"must we divide among us all his substance, and moreover give the house"
1486,BOOK II.,"to his mother to possess it, and to him whosoever should wed her.”"
1487,BOOK II.,
1488,BOOK II.,So spake they; but he stepped down into the vaulted treasure-chamber of
1489,BOOK II.,"his father, a spacious room, where gold and bronze lay piled, and"
1490,BOOK II.,"raiment in coffers, and fragrant olive oil in plenty. And there stood"
1491,BOOK II.,"casks of sweet wine and old, full of the unmixed drink divine, all"
1492,BOOK II.,"orderly ranged by the wall, ready if ever Odysseus should come home,"
1493,BOOK II.,"albeit after travail and much pain. And the close-fitted doors, the"
1494,BOOK II.,"folding doors, were shut, and night and day there abode within a dame"
1495,BOOK II.,"in charge, who guarded all in the fulness of her wisdom, Eurycleia,"
1496,BOOK II.,daughter of Ops son of Peisenor. Telemachus now called her into the
1497,BOOK II.,"chamber and spake unto her, saying:"
1498,BOOK II.,
1499,BOOK II.,"“Mother, come draw off for me sweet wine in jars, the choicest next to"
1500,BOOK II.,"that thou keepest mindful ever of that ill-fated one, Odysseus, of the"
1501,BOOK II.,"seed of Zeus, if perchance he may come I know not whence, having"
1502,BOOK II.,"avoided death and the fates. So fill twelve jars, and close each with"
1503,BOOK II.,"his lid, and pour me barley-meal into well-sewn skins, and let there be"
1504,BOOK II.,twenty measures of the grain of bruised barley-meal. Let none know this
1505,BOOK II.,but thyself! As for these things let them all be got together; for in
1506,BOOK II.,"the evening I will take them with me, at the time that my mother hath"
1507,BOOK II.,"gone to her upper chamber and turned her thoughts to sleep. Lo, to"
1508,BOOK II.,Sparta I go and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of my dear father’s
1509,BOOK II.,"return, if haply I may hear thereof.”"
1510,BOOK II.,
1511,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and the good nurse Eurycleia wailed aloud, and making"
1512,BOOK II.,"lament spake to him winged words: “Ah, wherefore, dear child, hath such"
1513,BOOK II.,a thought arisen in thine heart? How shouldst thou fare over wide
1514,BOOK II.,"lands, thou that art an only child and well-beloved? As for him he hath"
1515,BOOK II.,"perished, Odysseus of the seed of Zeus, far from his own country in the"
1516,BOOK II.,"land of strangers. And yonder men, so soon as thou art gone, will"
1517,BOOK II.,"devise mischief against thee thereafter, that thou mayest perish by"
1518,BOOK II.,"guile, and they will share among them all this wealth of thine. Nay,"
1519,BOOK II.,"abide here, settled on thine own lands: thou hast no need upon the deep"
1520,BOOK II.,unharvested to suffer evil and go wandering.”
1521,BOOK II.,
1522,BOOK II.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “Take heart, nurse, for lo,"
1523,BOOK II.,this my purpose came not but of a god. But swear to tell no word
1524,BOOK II.,"thereof to my dear mother, till at least it shall be the eleventh or"
1525,BOOK II.,"twelfth day from hence, or till she miss me of herself, and hear of my"
1526,BOOK II.,"departure, that so she may not mar her fair face with her tears.”"
1527,BOOK II.,
1528,BOOK II.,"Thus he spake, and the old woman sware a great oath by the gods not to"
1529,BOOK II.,"reveal it. But when she had sworn and done that oath, straightway she"
1530,BOOK II.,"drew off the wine for him in jars, and poured barley-meal into"
1531,BOOK II.,"well-sewn skins, and Telemachus departed to the house and consorted"
1532,BOOK II.,with the wooers.
1533,BOOK II.,
1534,BOOK II.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other thoughts. In the"
1535,BOOK II.,"likeness of Telemachus she went all through the city, and stood by each"
1536,BOOK II.,"one of the men and spake her saying, and bade them gather at even by"
1537,BOOK II.,"the swift ship. Furthermore, she craved a swift ship of Noëmon, famous"
1538,BOOK II.,"son of Phronius, and right gladly he promised it."
1539,BOOK II.,
1540,BOOK II.,Now the sun sank and all the ways were darkened. Then at length she let
1541,BOOK II.,drag the swift ship to the sea and stored within it all such tackling
1542,BOOK II.,as decked ships carry. And she moored it at the far end of the harbour
1543,BOOK II.,"and the good company was gathered together, and the goddess cheered on"
1544,BOOK II.,all.
1545,BOOK II.,
1546,BOOK II.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other thoughts. She went"
1547,BOOK II.,on her way to the house of divine Odysseus; and there she shed sweet
1548,BOOK II.,"sleep upon the wooers and made them distraught in their drinking, and"
1549,BOOK II.,cast the cups from their hands. And they arose up to go to rest
1550,BOOK II.,"throughout the city, nor sat they yet a long while, for slumber was"
1551,BOOK II.,"falling on their eyelids. Now grey-eyed Athene spake unto Telemachus,"
1552,BOOK II.,"and called him from out the fair-lying halls, taking the likeness of"
1553,BOOK II.,"Mentor, both in fashion and in voice:"
1554,BOOK II.,
1555,BOOK II.,"“Telemachus, thy goodly-greaved companions are sitting already at their"
1556,BOOK II.,"oars, it is thy despatch they are awaiting. Nay then, let us go, that"
1557,BOOK II.,we delay them not long from the way.”
1558,BOOK II.,
1559,BOOK II.,"Therewith Pallas Athene led the way quickly, and he followed hard in"
1560,BOOK II.,the steps of the goddess. Now when they had come down to the ship and
1561,BOOK II.,"to the sea, they found the long-haired youths of the company on the"
1562,BOOK II.,shore; and the mighty prince Telemachus spake among them:
1563,BOOK II.,
1564,BOOK II.,"“Come hither, friends, let us carry the corn on board, for all is now"
1565,BOOK II.,"together in the room, and my mother knows nought thereof, nor any of"
1566,BOOK II.,the maidens of the house: one woman only heard my saying.”
1567,BOOK II.,
1568,BOOK II.,"Thus he spake and led the way, and they went with him. So they brought"
1569,BOOK II.,"all and stowed it in the decked ship, according to the word of the dear"
1570,BOOK II.,"son of Odysseus. Then Telemachus climbed the ship, and Athene went"
1571,BOOK II.,"before him, and behold, she sat her down in the stern, and near her sat"
1572,BOOK II.,Telemachus. And the men loosed the hawsers and climbed on board
1573,BOOK II.,themselves and sat down upon the benches. And grey-eyed Athene sent
1574,BOOK II.,"them a favourable gale, a fresh West Wind, singing over the wine-dark"
1575,BOOK II.,sea.
1576,BOOK II.,
1577,BOOK II.,And Telemachus called unto his company and bade them lay hands on the
1578,BOOK II.,"tackling, and they hearkened to his call. So they raised the mast of"
1579,BOOK II.,"pine tree and set it in the hole of the cross plank, and made it fast"
1580,BOOK II.,"with forestays, and hauled up the white sails with twisted ropes of"
1581,BOOK II.,"oxhide. And the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave"
1582,BOOK II.,"seethed loudly round the stem of the running ship, and she fleeted over"
1583,BOOK II.,"the wave, accomplishing her path. Then they made all fast in the swift"
1584,BOOK II.,"black ship, and set mixing bowls brimmed with wine, and poured drink"
1585,BOOK II.,"offering to the deathless gods that are from everlasting, and in chief"
1586,BOOK II.,to the grey-eyed daughter of Zeus. So all night long and through the
1587,BOOK II.,dawn the ship cleft her way.
1588,BOOK II.,
1589,BOOK II.,
1590,BOOK II.,
1591,BOOK III.,BOOK III.
1592,BOOK III.,
1593,BOOK III.,
1594,BOOK III.,Nestor entertains Telemachus at Pylos and tells him how the Greeks
1595,BOOK III.,departed from Troy; and sends him for further information to Sparta.
1596,BOOK III.,
1597,BOOK III.,
1598,BOOK III.,"Now the sun arose and left the lovely mere, speeding to the brazen"
1599,BOOK III.,"heaven, to give light to the immortals and to mortal men on the earth,"
1600,BOOK III.,"the graingiver, and they reached Pylos, the stablished castle of"
1601,BOOK III.,"Neleus. There the people were doing sacrifice on the sea shore, slaying"
1602,BOOK III.,"black bulls without spot to the dark-haired god, the shaker of the"
1603,BOOK III.,"earth. Nine companies there were, and five hundred men sat in each, and"
1604,BOOK III.,in every company they held nine bulls ready to hand. Just as they had
1605,BOOK III.,"tasted the inner parts, and were burning the slices of the thighs on"
1606,BOOK III.,"the altar to the god, the others were bearing straight to land, and"
1607,BOOK III.,"brailed up the sails of the gallant ship, and moored her, and"
1608,BOOK III.,"themselves came forth. And Telemachus too stept forth from the ship,"
1609,BOOK III.,"and Athene led the way. And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake first"
1610,BOOK III.,"to him, saying:"
1611,BOOK III.,
1612,BOOK III.,"“Telemachus, thou needst not now be abashed, no, not one whit. For to"
1613,BOOK III.,"this very end didst thou sail over the deep, that thou mightest hear"
1614,BOOK III.,"tidings of thy father, even where the earth closed over him, and what"
1615,BOOK III.,"manner of death he met. But come now, go straight to Nestor, tamer of"
1616,BOOK III.,horses: let us learn what counsel he hath in the secret of his heart.
1617,BOOK III.,And beseech him thyself that he may give unerring answer; and he will
1618,BOOK III.,"not lie to thee, for he is very wise.”"
1619,BOOK III.,
1620,BOOK III.,"The wise Telemachus answered, saying: “Mentor, and how shall I go, how"
1621,BOOK III.,"shall I greet him, I, who am untried in words of wisdom? Moreover a"
1622,BOOK III.,young man may well be abashed to question an elder.”
1623,BOOK III.,
1624,BOOK III.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again: “Telemachus,"
1625,BOOK III.,"thou shalt bethink thee of somewhat in thine own breast, and somewhat"
1626,BOOK III.,"the god will give thee to say. For thou, methinks, of all men wert not"
1627,BOOK III.,born and bred without the will of the gods.”
1628,BOOK III.,
1629,BOOK III.,So spake Pallas Athene and led the way quickly; and he followed hard in
1630,BOOK III.,the steps of the goddess. And they came to the gathering and the
1631,BOOK III.,"session of the men of Pylos. There was Nestor seated with his sons, and"
1632,BOOK III.,"round him his company making ready the feast, and roasting some of the"
1633,BOOK III.,"flesh and spitting other. Now when they saw the strangers, they went"
1634,BOOK III.,"all together, and clasped their hands in welcome, and would have them"
1635,BOOK III.,"sit down. First Peisistratus, son of Nestor, drew nigh, and took the"
1636,BOOK III.,"hands of each, and made them to sit down at the feast on soft fleeces"
1637,BOOK III.,"upon the sea sand, beside his brother Thrasymedes and his father. And"
1638,BOOK III.,"he gave them messes of the inner meat, and poured wine into a golden"
1639,BOOK III.,"cup, and pledging her, he spake unto Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus,"
1640,BOOK III.,lord of the aegis:
1641,BOOK III.,
1642,BOOK III.,"“Pray now, my guest, to the lord Poseidon, even as it is his feast"
1643,BOOK III.,whereon ye have chanced in coming hither. And when thou hast made drink
1644,BOOK III.,"offering and prayed, as is due, give thy friend also the cup of honeyed"
1645,BOOK III.,"wine to make offering thereof, inasmuch as he too, methinks, prayeth to"
1646,BOOK III.,"the deathless gods, for all men stand in need of the gods. Howbeit he"
1647,BOOK III.,"is younger and mine own equal in years, therefore to thee first will I"
1648,BOOK III.,give the golden chalice.”
1649,BOOK III.,
1650,BOOK III.,Therewith he placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine. And Athene
1651,BOOK III.,"rejoiced in the wisdom and judgment of the man, in that he had given to"
1652,BOOK III.,"her first the chalice of gold. And straightway she prayed, and that"
1653,BOOK III.,"instantly, to the lord Poseidon:"
1654,BOOK III.,
1655,BOOK III.,"“Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, and grudge not the fulfilment"
1656,BOOK III.,of this labour in answer to our prayer. To Nestor first and to his sons
1657,BOOK III.,"vouchsafe renown, and thereafter grant to all the people of Pylos a"
1658,BOOK III.,gracious recompense for this splendid hecatomb. Grant moreover that
1659,BOOK III.,"Telemachus and I may return, when we have accomplished that for which"
1660,BOOK III.,we came hither with our swift black ship.”
1661,BOOK III.,
1662,BOOK III.,"Now as she prayed on this wise, herself the while was fulfilling the"
1663,BOOK III.,prayer. And she gave Telemachus the fair two-handled cup; and in like
1664,BOOK III.,"manner prayed the dear son of Odysseus. Then, when the others had"
1665,BOOK III.,"roasted the outer parts and drawn them off the spits, they divided the"
1666,BOOK III.,messes and shared the glorious feast. But when they had put from them
1667,BOOK III.,"the desire of meat and drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots,"
1668,BOOK III.,first spake among them:
1669,BOOK III.,
1670,BOOK III.,“Now is the better time to enquire and ask of the strangers who they
1671,BOOK III.,"are, now that they have had their delight of food. Strangers, who are"
1672,BOOK III.,"ye? Whence sail ye over the wet ways? On some trading enterprise, or at"
1673,BOOK III.,"adventure do ye rove, even as sea-robbers, over the brine, for they"
1674,BOOK III.,wander at hazard of their own lives bringing bale to alien men?”
1675,BOOK III.,
1676,BOOK III.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him and spake with courage, for Athene"
1677,BOOK III.,"herself had put boldness in his heart, that he might ask about his"
1678,BOOK III.,"father who was afar, and that he might be had in good report among men:"
1679,BOOK III.,
1680,BOOK III.,"“Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans, thou askest whence"
1681,BOOK III.,"we are, and I will surely tell thee all. We have come forth out of"
1682,BOOK III.,Ithaca that is below Neïon; and this our quest whereof I speak is a
1683,BOOK III.,"matter of mine own, and not of the common weal. I follow after the"
1684,BOOK III.,"far-spread rumour of my father, if haply I may hear thereof, even of"
1685,BOOK III.,"the goodly steadfast Odysseus, who upon a time, men say, fought by thy"
1686,BOOK III.,"side and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all the others, as many"
1687,BOOK III.,"as warred with the Trojans, we hear tidings, and where each one fell by"
1688,BOOK III.,a pitiful death; but even the death of this man Cronion hath left
1689,BOOK III.,"untold. For none can surely declare the place where he hath perished,"
1690,BOOK III.,"whether he was smitten by foemen on the mainland, or lost upon the deep"
1691,BOOK III.,"among the waves of Amphitrite. So now am I come hither to thy knees, if"
1692,BOOK III.,"perchance thou art willing to tell me of his pitiful death, as one that"
1693,BOOK III.,"saw it with thine own eyes, or heard the story from some other"
1694,BOOK III.,"wanderer,—for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And speak me no"
1695,BOOK III.,"soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly what sight thou didst"
1696,BOOK III.,"get of him. Ah! I pray thee, if ever at all my father, noble Odysseus,"
1697,BOOK III.,"made promise to thee of word or work, and fulfilled the same in the"
1698,BOOK III.,"land of the Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction; these"
1699,BOOK III.,"things, I pray thee, now remember and tell me truth.”"
1700,BOOK III.,
1701,BOOK III.,"Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him: “My friend,"
1702,BOOK III.,"since thou hast brought sorrow back to mind, behold, this is the story"
1703,BOOK III.,"of the woe which we endured in that land, we sons of the Achaeans,"
1704,BOOK III.,"unrestrained in fury, and of all that we bore in wanderings after"
1705,BOOK III.,"spoil, sailing with our ships over the misty deep, wheresoever Achilles"
1706,BOOK III.,led; and of all our war round the mighty burg of king Priam. Yea and
1707,BOOK III.,"there the best of us were slain. There lies valiant Aias, and there"
1708,BOOK III.,"Achilles, and there Patroclus, the peer of the gods in counsel, and"
1709,BOOK III.,"there my own dear son, strong and noble, Antilochus, that excelled in"
1710,BOOK III.,speed of foot and in the fight. And many other ills we suffered beside
1711,BOOK III.,"these; who of mortal men could tell the tale? Nay none, though thou"
1712,BOOK III.,"wert to abide here for five years, ay and for six, and ask of all the"
1713,BOOK III.,ills which the goodly Achaeans then endured. Ere all was told thou
1714,BOOK III.,wouldst be weary and turn to thine own country. For nine whole years we
1715,BOOK III.,"were busy about them, devising their ruin with all manner of craft; and"
1716,BOOK III.,scarce did Cronion bring it to pass. There never a man durst match with
1717,BOOK III.,"him in wisdom, for goodly Odysseus very far outdid the rest in all"
1718,BOOK III.,"manner of craft, Odysseus thy father, if indeed thou art his"
1719,BOOK III.,"son,—amazement comes upon me as I look at thee; for verily thy speech"
1720,BOOK III.,is like unto his; none would say that a younger man would speak so like
1721,BOOK III.,"an elder. Now look you, all the while that myself and goodly Odysseus"
1722,BOOK III.,"were there, we never spake diversely either in the assembly or in the"
1723,BOOK III.,"council, but always were of one mind, and advised the Argives with"
1724,BOOK III.,"understanding and sound counsel, how all might be for the very best."
1725,BOOK III.,"But after we had sacked the steep city of Priam, and had departed in"
1726,BOOK III.,"our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, even then did Zeus"
1727,BOOK III.,"devise in his heart a pitiful returning for the Argives, for in no wise"
1728,BOOK III.,were they all discreet or just. Wherefore many of them met with an ill
1729,BOOK III.,"faring by reason of the deadly wrath of the grey-eyed goddess, the"
1730,BOOK III.,"daughter of the mighty sire, who set debate between the two sons of"
1731,BOOK III.,Atreus. And they twain called to the gathering of the host all the
1732,BOOK III.,"Achaeans, recklessly and out of order, against the going down of the"
1733,BOOK III.,"sun; and lo, the sons of the Achaeans came heavy with wine. And the"
1734,BOOK III.,Atreidae spake out and told the reason wherefore they had assembled the
1735,BOOK III.,host. Then verily Menelaus charged all the Achaeans to bethink them of
1736,BOOK III.,"returning over the broad back of the sea, but in no sort did he please"
1737,BOOK III.,"Agamemnon, whose desire was to keep back the host and to offer holy"
1738,BOOK III.,"hecatombs, that so he might appease that dread wrath of Athene. Fool!"
1739,BOOK III.,"for he knew not this, that she was never to be won; for the mind of the"
1740,BOOK III.,everlasting gods is not lightly turned to repentance. So these twain
1741,BOOK III.,stood bandying hard words; but the goodly-greaved Achaeans sprang up
1742,BOOK III.,"with a wondrous din, and twofold counsels found favour among them. So"
1743,BOOK III.,"that one night we rested, thinking hard things against each other, for"
1744,BOOK III.,"Zeus was fashioning for us a ruinous doom. But in the morning, we of"
1745,BOOK III.,"the one part drew our ships to the fair salt sea, and put aboard our"
1746,BOOK III.,"wealth, and the low-girdled Trojan women. Now one half the people abode"
1747,BOOK III.,"steadfastly there with Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host;"
1748,BOOK III.,"and half of us embarked and drave to sea and swiftly the ships sailed,"
1749,BOOK III.,for a god made smooth the sea with the depths thereof. And when we came
1750,BOOK III.,"to Tenedos, we did sacrifice to the gods, being eager for the homeward"
1751,BOOK III.,"way; but Zeus did not yet purpose our returning, nay, hard was he, that"
1752,BOOK III.,roused once more an evil strife among us. Then some turned back their
1753,BOOK III.,"curved ships, and went their way, even the company of Odysseus, the"
1754,BOOK III.,"wise and manifold in counsel, once again showing a favour to Agamemnon,"
1755,BOOK III.,"son of Atreus. But I fled on with the squadron that followed me, for I"
1756,BOOK III.,knew how now the god imagined mischief. And the warlike son of Tydeus
1757,BOOK III.,fled and roused his men thereto. And late in our track came Menelaus of
1758,BOOK III.,"the fair hair, who found us in Lesbos, considering about the long"
1759,BOOK III.,"voyage, whether we should go sea-ward of craggy Chios, by the isle of"
1760,BOOK III.,"Psyria, keeping the isle upon our left, or inside Chios past windy"
1761,BOOK III.,"Mimas. So we asked the god to show us a sign, and a sign he declared to"
1762,BOOK III.,"us, and bade us cleave a path across the middle sea to Euboea, that we"
1763,BOOK III.,might flee the swiftest way from sorrow. And a shrill wind arose and
1764,BOOK III.,"blew, and the ships ran most fleetly over the teeming ways, and in the"
1765,BOOK III.,night they touched at Geraestus. So there we sacrificed many thighs of
1766,BOOK III.,"bulls to Poseidon, for joy that we had measured out so great a stretch"
1767,BOOK III.,of sea. It was the fourth day when the company of Diomede son of
1768,BOOK III.,"Tydeus, tamer of horses, moored their gallant ships at Argos; but I"
1769,BOOK III.,"held on for Pylos, and the breeze was never quenched from the hour that"
1770,BOOK III.,"the god sent it forth to blow. Even so I came, dear child, without"
1771,BOOK III.,"tidings, nor know I aught of those others, which of the Achaeans were"
1772,BOOK III.,saved and which were lost. But all that I hear tell of as I sit in our
1773,BOOK III.,"halls, thou shalt learn as it is meet, and I will hide nothing from"
1774,BOOK III.,"thee. Safely, they say, came the Myrmidons the wild spearsmen, whom the"
1775,BOOK III.,"famous son of high-souled Achilles led; and safely Philoctetes, the"
1776,BOOK III.,"glorious son of Poias. And Idomeneus brought all his company to Crete,"
1777,BOOK III.,"all that escaped the war, and from him the sea gat none. And of the son"
1778,BOOK III.,"of Atreus even yourselves have heard, far apart though ye dwell, how he"
1779,BOOK III.,"came, and how Aegisthus devised his evil end; but verily he himself"
1780,BOOK III.,paid a terrible reckoning. So good a thing it is that a son of the dead
1781,BOOK III.,"should still be left, even as that son also took vengeance on the"
1782,BOOK III.,"slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus, who slew his famous sire. And"
1783,BOOK III.,"thou too, my friend, for I see thee very comely and tall, be valiant,"
1784,BOOK III.,that even men unborn may praise thee.”
1785,BOOK III.,
1786,BOOK III.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, and said: “Nestor, son of Neleus,"
1787,BOOK III.,"great glory of the Achaeans, verily and indeed he avenged himself, and"
1788,BOOK III.,"the Achaeans shall noise his fame abroad, that even those may hear who"
1789,BOOK III.,are yet for to be. Oh that the gods would clothe me with such strength
1790,BOOK III.,"as his, that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their cruel"
1791,BOOK III.,"transgression, who wantonly devise against me infatuate deeds! But the"
1792,BOOK III.,"gods have woven for me the web of no such weal, for me or for my sire."
1793,BOOK III.,But now I must in any wise endure it.”
1794,BOOK III.,
1795,BOOK III.,"Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, made answer: “Dear friend,"
1796,BOOK III.,"seeing thou dost call these things to my remembrance and speak thereof,"
1797,BOOK III.,they tell me that many wooers for thy mother’s hand plan mischief
1798,BOOK III.,"within the halls in thy despite. Say, dost thou willingly submit thee"
1799,BOOK III.,"to oppression, or do the people through the land hate thee, obedient to"
1800,BOOK III.,the voice of a god? Who knows but that Odysseus may some day come and
1801,BOOK III.,"requite their violence, either himself alone or all the host of the"
1802,BOOK III.,"Achaeans with him? Ah, if but grey-eyed Athene were inclined to love"
1803,BOOK III.,"thee, as once she cared exceedingly for the renowned Odysseus in the"
1804,BOOK III.,"land of the Trojans, where we Achaeans were sore afflicted, for never"
1805,BOOK III.,"yet have I seen the gods show forth such manifest love, as then did"
1806,BOOK III.,"Pallas Athene standing manifest by him,—if she would be pleased so to"
1807,BOOK III.,"love thee and to care for thee, then might certain of them clean forget"
1808,BOOK III.,their marriage.”
1809,BOOK III.,
1810,BOOK III.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Old man, in no wise methinks"
1811,BOOK III.,"shall this word be accomplished. This is a hard saying of thine, awe"
1812,BOOK III.,"comes over me. Not for my hopes shall this thing come to pass, not even"
1813,BOOK III.,if the gods so willed it.”
1814,BOOK III.,
1815,BOOK III.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again: “Telemachus,"
1816,BOOK III.,"what word hath escaped the door of thy lips? Lightly might a god, if so"
1817,BOOK III.,"he would, bring a man safe home even from afar. Rather myself would I"
1818,BOOK III.,have travail and much pain ere I came home and saw the day of my
1819,BOOK III.,"returning, than come back and straightway perish on my own"
1820,BOOK III.,"hearth-stone, even as Agamemnon perished by guile at the hands of his"
1821,BOOK III.,"own wife and of Aegisthus. But lo you, death, which is common to all,"
1822,BOOK III.,"the very gods cannot avert even from the man they love, when the"
1823,BOOK III.,ruinous doom shall bring him low of death that lays men at their
1824,BOOK III.,length.”
1825,BOOK III.,
1826,BOOK III.,"And wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “Mentor, no longer let us"
1827,BOOK III.,"tell of these things, sorrowful though we be. There is none assurance"
1828,BOOK III.,"any more of his returning, but already have the deathless gods devised"
1829,BOOK III.,"for him death and black fate. But now I would question Nestor, and ask"
1830,BOOK III.,"him of another matter, as one who above all men knows judgments and"
1831,BOOK III.,"wisdom: for thrice, men say, he hath been king through the generations"
1832,BOOK III.,"of men; yea, like an immortal he seems to me to look upon. Nestor, son"
1833,BOOK III.,"of Neleus, now tell me true: how died the son of Atreus, Agamemnon of"
1834,BOOK III.,the wide domain? Where was Menelaus? What death did crafty Aegisthus
1835,BOOK III.,"plan for him, in that he killed a man more valiant far than he? Or was"
1836,BOOK III.,"Menelaus not in Argos of Achaia but wandering elsewhere among men, and"
1837,BOOK III.,that other took heart and slew Agamemnon?”
1838,BOOK III.,
1839,BOOK III.,"Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him: “Yea now, my"
1840,BOOK III.,"child, I will tell thee the whole truth. Verily thou guessest aright"
1841,BOOK III.,"even of thyself how things would have fallen out, if Menelaus of the"
1842,BOOK III.,"fair hair, the son of Atreus, when he came back from Troy, had found"
1843,BOOK III.,Aegisthus yet alive in the halls. Then even in his death would they not
1844,BOOK III.,"have heaped the piled earth over him, but dogs and fowls of the air"
1845,BOOK III.,would have devoured him as he lay on the plain far from the town.[6]
1846,BOOK III.,Nor would any of the Achaean women have bewailed him; so dread was the
1847,BOOK III.,"deed he contrived. Now we sat in leaguer there, achieving many"
1848,BOOK III.,"adventures; but he the while in peace in the heart of Argos, the"
1849,BOOK III.,"pastureland of horses, spake ofttimes, tempting her, to the wife of"
1850,BOOK III.,"Agamemnon. Verily at the first she would none of the foul deed, the"
1851,BOOK III.,"fair Clytemnestra, for she had a good understanding. Moreover there was"
1852,BOOK III.,"with her a minstrel, whom the son of Atreus straitly charged as he went"
1853,BOOK III.,to Troy to have a care of his wife. But when at last the doom of the
1854,BOOK III.,"gods bound her to her ruin, then did Aegisthus carry the minstrel to a"
1855,BOOK III.,"lonely isle, and left him there to be the prey and spoil of birds;"
1856,BOOK III.,"while as for her, he led her to his house, a willing lover with a"
1857,BOOK III.,willing lady. And he burnt many thigh slices upon the holy altars of
1858,BOOK III.,"the gods, and hung up many offerings, woven-work and gold, seeing that"
1859,BOOK III.,"he had accomplished a great deed, beyond all hope. Now we, I say, were"
1860,BOOK III.,"sailing together on our way from Troy, the son of Atreus and I, as"
1861,BOOK III.,"loving friends. But when we had reached holy Sunium, the headland of"
1862,BOOK III.,"Athens, there Phoebus Apollo slew the pilot of Menelaus with the"
1863,BOOK III.,"visitation of his gentle shafts, as he held between his hands the"
1864,BOOK III.,"rudder of the running ship, even Phrontis, son of Onetor, who excelled"
1865,BOOK III.,"the tribes of men in piloting a ship, whenso the storm-winds were"
1866,BOOK III.,"hurrying by. Thus was Menelaus holden there, though eager for the way,"
1867,BOOK III.,till he might bury his friend and pay the last rites over him. But when
1868,BOOK III.,"he in his turn, faring over the wine-dark sea in hollow ships, reached"
1869,BOOK III.,"in swift course the steep mount of Malea, then it was that Zeus of the"
1870,BOOK III.,"far-borne voice devised a hateful path, and shed upon them the breath"
1871,BOOK III.,"of the shrill winds, and great swelling waves arose like unto"
1872,BOOK III.,"mountains. There sundered he the fleet in twain, and part thereof he"
1873,BOOK III.,"brought nigh to Crete, where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams of"
1874,BOOK III.,"Iardanus. Now there is a certain cliff, smooth and sheer towards the"
1875,BOOK III.,"sea, on the border of Gortyn, in the misty deep, where the South-West"
1876,BOOK III.,"Wind drives a great wave against the left headland, towards Phaestus,"
1877,BOOK III.,and a little rock keeps back the mighty water. Thither came one part of
1878,BOOK III.,"the fleet, and the men scarce escaped destruction, but the ships were"
1879,BOOK III.,broken by the waves against the rock; while those other five
1880,BOOK III.,dark-prowed ships the wind and the water bare and brought nigh to
1881,BOOK III.,"Egypt. Thus Menelaus, gathering much livelihood and gold, was wandering"
1882,BOOK III.,"there with his ships among men of strange speech, and even then"
1883,BOOK III.,Aegisthus planned that pitiful work at home. And for seven years he
1884,BOOK III.,"ruled over Mycenae, rich in gold, after he slew the son of Atreus, and"
1885,BOOK III.,the people were subdued unto him. But in the eighth year came upon him
1886,BOOK III.,"goodly Orestes back from Athens to be his bane, and slew the slayer of"
1887,BOOK III.,"his father, guileful Aegisthus, who killed his famous sire. Now when he"
1888,BOOK III.,"had slain him, he made a funeral feast to the Argives over his hateful"
1889,BOOK III.,"mother, and over the craven Aegisthus. And on the selfsame day there"
1890,BOOK III.,"came to him Menelaus of the loud war-cry, bringing much treasure, even"
1891,BOOK III.,"all the freight of his ships. So thou, my friend, wander not long far"
1892,BOOK III.,"away from home, leaving thy substance behind thee and men in thy house"
1893,BOOK III.,"so wanton, lest they divide and utterly devour all thy wealth, and thou"
1894,BOOK III.,shalt have gone on a vain journey. Rather I bid and command thee to go
1895,BOOK III.,"to Menelaus, for he hath lately come from a strange country, from the"
1896,BOOK III.,"land of men whence none would hope in his heart to return, whom once"
1897,BOOK III.,the storms have driven wandering into so wide a sea. Thence not even
1898,BOOK III.,"the birds can make their way in the space of one year, so great a sea"
1899,BOOK III.,"it is and terrible. But go now with thy ship and with thy company, or"
1900,BOOK III.,"if thou hast a mind to fare by land, I have a chariot and horses at thy"
1901,BOOK III.,"service, yea and my sons to do thy will, who will be thy guides to"
1902,BOOK III.,"goodly Lacedaemon, where is Menelaus of the fair hair. Do thou thyself"
1903,BOOK III.,"entreat him, that he may give thee unerring answer. He will not lie to"
1904,BOOK III.,"thee, for he is very wise.”"
1905,BOOK III.,
1906,BOOK III.,"[6] Reading ἄστεος. v. 1. Ἄργεος, which must be wrong."
1907,BOOK III.,
1908,BOOK III.,
1909,BOOK III.,"Thus he spake, and the sun went down and darkness came on. Then the"
1910,BOOK III.,"goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake among them, saying: “Yea, old man,"
1911,BOOK III.,"thou hast told all this thy tale aright. But come, cut up the tongues"
1912,BOOK III.,"of the victims and mix the wine, that we may pour forth before Poseidon"
1913,BOOK III.,"and the other deathless gods, and so may bethink us of sleep, for it is"
1914,BOOK III.,"the hour for sleep. For already has the light gone beneath the west,"
1915,BOOK III.,"and it is not seemly to sit long at a banquet of the gods, but to be"
1916,BOOK III.,going home.”
1917,BOOK III.,
1918,BOOK III.,"So spake the daughter of Zeus, and they hearkened to her voice. And the"
1919,BOOK III.,"henchmen poured water over their hands, and pages crowned the mixing"
1920,BOOK III.,"bowls with drink, and served out the wine to all, after they had first"
1921,BOOK III.,poured for libation into each cup in turn; and they cast the tongues
1922,BOOK III.,"upon the fire, and stood up and poured the drink-offering thereon. But"
1923,BOOK III.,"when they had poured forth and had drunken to their heart’s content,"
1924,BOOK III.,Athene and godlike Telemachus were both set on returning to the hollow
1925,BOOK III.,"ship; but Nestor would have stayed them, and accosted them, saying:"
1926,BOOK III.,"“Zeus forfend it, and all the other deathless gods, that ye should"
1927,BOOK III.,"depart from my house to the swift ship, as from the dwelling of one"
1928,BOOK III.,"that is utterly without raiment or a needy man, who hath not rugs or"
1929,BOOK III.,"blankets many in his house whereon to sleep softly, he or his guests."
1930,BOOK III.,"Nay not so, I have rugs and fair blankets by me. Never, methinks, shall"
1931,BOOK III.,"the dear son of this man, even of Odysseus, lay him down upon the"
1932,BOOK III.,"ship’s deck, while as yet I am alive, and my children after me are left"
1933,BOOK III.,"in my hall to entertain strangers, whoso may chance to come to my"
1934,BOOK III.,house.”
1935,BOOK III.,
1936,BOOK III.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again: “Yea, herein"
1937,BOOK III.,"hast thou spoken aright, dear father: and Telemachus may well obey"
1938,BOOK III.,"thee, for before all things this is meet. Behold, he shall now depart"
1939,BOOK III.,"with thee, that he may sleep in thy halls; as for me I will go to the"
1940,BOOK III.,"black ship, that I may cheer my company and tell them all. For I avow"
1941,BOOK III.,"me to be the one elder among them; those others are but younger men,"
1942,BOOK III.,"who follow for love of him, all of them of like age with the"
1943,BOOK III.,high-souled Telemachus. There will I lay me down by the black hollow
1944,BOOK III.,ship this night; but in the morning I will go to the Cauconians high of
1945,BOOK III.,"heart, where somewhat of mine is owing to me, no small debt nor of"
1946,BOOK III.,yesterday. But do thou send this man upon his way with thy chariot and
1947,BOOK III.,"thy son, since he hath come to thy house, and give him horses the"
1948,BOOK III.,lightest of foot and chief in strength.”
1949,BOOK III.,
1950,BOOK III.,Therewith grey-eyed Athene departed in the semblance of a sea-eagle;
1951,BOOK III.,"and amazement fell on all that saw it, and the old man he marvelled"
1952,BOOK III.,when his eyes beheld it. And he took the hand of Telemachus and spake
1953,BOOK III.,and hailed him:
1954,BOOK III.,
1955,BOOK III.,"“My friend, methinks that thou wilt in no sort be a coward and a"
1956,BOOK III.,"weakling, if indeed in thy youth the gods thus follow with thee to be"
1957,BOOK III.,thy guides. For truly this is none other of those who keep the mansions
1958,BOOK III.,"of Olympus, save only the daughter of Zeus, the driver of the spoil,"
1959,BOOK III.,"the maiden Trito-born, she that honoured thy good father too among the"
1960,BOOK III.,"Argives. Nay be gracious, queen, and vouchsafe a goodly fame to me,"
1961,BOOK III.,even to me and to my sons and to my wife revered. And I in turn will
1962,BOOK III.,"sacrifice to thee a yearling heifer, broad of brow, unbroken, which man"
1963,BOOK III.,"never yet hath led beneath the yoke. Such an one will I offer to thee,"
1964,BOOK III.,and gild her horns with gold.”
1965,BOOK III.,
1966,BOOK III.,"Even so he spake in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him. Then Nestor of"
1967,BOOK III.,"Gerenia, lord of chariots, led them, even his sons and the husbands of"
1968,BOOK III.,"his daughters, to his own fair house. But when they had reached this"
1969,BOOK III.,"prince’s famous halls, they sat down all orderly on seats and high"
1970,BOOK III.,"chairs; and when they were come, the old man mixed well for them a bowl"
1971,BOOK III.,"of sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year from the vintaging the"
1972,BOOK III.,"housewife opened, and unloosed the string that fastened the lid. The"
1973,BOOK III.,"old man let mix a bowl thereof, and prayed instantly to Athene as he"
1974,BOOK III.,"poured forth before her, even to the daughter of Zeus, lord of the"
1975,BOOK III.,aegis.
1976,BOOK III.,
1977,BOOK III.,But after they had poured forth and had drunken to their heart’s
1978,BOOK III.,"content, these went each one to his own house to lie down to rest. But"
1979,BOOK III.,"Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, would needs have Telemachus, son"
1980,BOOK III.,"of divine Odysseus, to sleep there on a jointed bedstead beneath the"
1981,BOOK III.,"echoing gallery, and by him Peisistratus of the good ashen spear,"
1982,BOOK III.,"leader of men, who alone of his sons was yet unwed in his halls. As for"
1983,BOOK III.,"him he slept within the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and the lady"
1984,BOOK III.,his wife arrayed for him bedstead and bedding.
1985,BOOK III.,
1986,BOOK III.,"So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, Nestor of"
1987,BOOK III.,"Gerenia, lord of chariots, gat him up from his bed, and he went forth"
1988,BOOK III.,"and sat him down upon the smooth stones, which were before his lofty"
1989,BOOK III.,"doors, all polished, white and glistening, whereon Neleus sat of old,"
1990,BOOK III.,"in counsel the peer of the gods. Howbeit, stricken by fate, he had ere"
1991,BOOK III.,"now gone down to the house of Hades, and to-day Nestor of Gerenia in"
1992,BOOK III.,"his turn sat thereon, warder of the Achaeans, with his staff in his"
1993,BOOK III.,"hands. And about him his sons were gathered and come together, issuing"
1994,BOOK III.,"from their chambers, Echephron and Stratius, and Perseus and Aretus and"
1995,BOOK III.,the godlike Thrasymedes. And sixth and last came the hero Peisistratus.
1996,BOOK III.,"And they led godlike Telemachus and set him by their side, and Nestor"
1997,BOOK III.,"of Gerenia, lord of chariots, spake first among them:"
1998,BOOK III.,
1999,BOOK III.,"“Quickly, my dear children, accomplish my desire, that first of all the"
2000,BOOK III.,"gods I may propitiate Athene, who came to me in visible presence to the"
2001,BOOK III.,"rich feast of the god. Nay then, let one go to the plain for a heifer,"
2002,BOOK III.,"that she may come as soon as may be, and that the neat-herd may drive"
2003,BOOK III.,her: and let another go to the black ship of high-souled Telemachus to
2004,BOOK III.,"bring all his company, and let him leave two men only. And let one"
2005,BOOK III.,again bid Laerces the goldsmith to come hither that he may gild the
2006,BOOK III.,"horns of the heifer. And ye others, abide ye here together and speak to"
2007,BOOK III.,the handmaids within that they make ready a banquet through our famous
2008,BOOK III.,"halls, and fetch seats and logs to set about the altar, and bring clear"
2009,BOOK III.,water.”
2010,BOOK III.,
2011,BOOK III.,"Thus he spake and lo, they all hastened to the work. The heifer she"
2012,BOOK III.,"came from the field, and from the swift gallant ship came the company"
2013,BOOK III.,of great-hearted Telemachus; the smith came holding in his hands his
2014,BOOK III.,"tools, the instruments of his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made"
2015,BOOK III.,"pincers, wherewith he wrought the gold; Athene too came to receive her"
2016,BOOK III.,"sacrifice. And the old knight Nestor gave gold, and the other fashioned"
2017,BOOK III.,"it skilfully, and gilded therewith the horns of the heifer, that the"
2018,BOOK III.,goddess might be glad at the sight of her fair offering. And Stratius
2019,BOOK III.,and goodly Echephron led the heifer by the horns. And Aretus came forth
2020,BOOK III.,from the chamber bearing water for the washing of hands in a basin of
2021,BOOK III.,"flowered work, and in the other hand he held the barley-meal in a"
2022,BOOK III.,"basket; and Thrasymedes, steadfast in the battle, stood by holding in"
2023,BOOK III.,"his hand a sharp axe, ready to smite the heifer. And Perseus held the"
2024,BOOK III.,"dish for the blood, and the old man Nestor, driver of chariots,"
2025,BOOK III.,performed the first rite of the washing of hands and the sprinkling of
2026,BOOK III.,"the meal, and he prayed instantly to Athene as he began the rite,"
2027,BOOK III.,casting into the fire the lock from the head of the victim.
2028,BOOK III.,
2029,BOOK III.,"Now when they had prayed and tossed the sprinkled grain, straightway"
2030,BOOK III.,"the son of Nestor, gallant Thrasymedes, stood by and struck the blow;"
2031,BOOK III.,and the axe severed the tendons of the neck and loosened the might of
2032,BOOK III.,"the heifer; and the women raised their cry, the daughters and the sons’"
2033,BOOK III.,"wives and the wife revered of Nestor, Eurydice, eldest of the daughters"
2034,BOOK III.,of Clymenus. And now they lifted the victim’s head from the wide-wayed
2035,BOOK III.,"earth, and held it so, while Peisistratus, leader of men, cut the"
2036,BOOK III.,throat. And after the black blood had gushed forth and the life had
2037,BOOK III.,"left the bones, quickly they broke up the body, and anon cut slices"
2038,BOOK III.,"from the thighs all duly, and wrapt the same in the fat, folding them"
2039,BOOK III.,"double, and laid raw flesh thereon. So that old man burnt them on the"
2040,BOOK III.,"cleft wood, and poured over them the red wine, and by his side the"
2041,BOOK III.,young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. Now after that
2042,BOOK III.,"the thighs were quite consumed and they had tasted the inner parts,"
2043,BOOK III.,"they cut the rest up small and spitted and roasted it, holding the"
2044,BOOK III.,sharp spits in their hands.
2045,BOOK III.,
2046,BOOK III.,"Meanwhile she bathed Telemachus, even fair Polycaste, the youngest"
2047,BOOK III.,"daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus. And after she had bathed him and"
2048,BOOK III.,"anointed him with olive oil, and cast about him a goodly mantle and a"
2049,BOOK III.,"doublet, he came forth from the bath in fashion like the deathless"
2050,BOOK III.,"gods. So he went and sat him down by Nestor, shepherd of the people."
2051,BOOK III.,
2052,BOOK III.,"Now when they had roasted the outer flesh, and drawn it off the spits,"
2053,BOOK III.,"they sat down and fell to feasting, and honourable men waited on them,"
2054,BOOK III.,pouring wine into the golden cups. But when they had put from them the
2055,BOOK III.,"desire of meat and drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, first"
2056,BOOK III.,spake among them:
2057,BOOK III.,
2058,BOOK III.,"“Lo now, my sons, yoke for Telemachus horses with flowing mane and lead"
2059,BOOK III.,"them beneath the car, that he may get forward on his way.”"
2060,BOOK III.,
2061,BOOK III.,"Even so he spake, and they gave good heed and hearkened; and quickly"
2062,BOOK III.,they yoked the swift horses beneath the chariot. And the dame that kept
2063,BOOK III.,"the stores placed therein corn and wine and dainties, such as princes"
2064,BOOK III.,"eat, the fosterlings of Zeus. So Telemachus stept up into the goodly"
2065,BOOK III.,"car, and with him Peisistratus son of Nestor, leader of men, likewise"
2066,BOOK III.,"climbed the car and grasped the reins in his hands, and he touched the"
2067,BOOK III.,"horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loth the pair flew"
2068,BOOK III.,"towards the plain, and left the steep citadel of Pylos. So all day long"
2069,BOOK III.,they swayed the yoke they bore upon their necks.
2070,BOOK III.,
2071,BOOK III.,Now the sun sank and all the ways were darkened. And they came to
2072,BOOK III.,"Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Orsilochus, the child begotten"
2073,BOOK III.,"of Alpheus. There they rested for the night, and by them he set the"
2074,BOOK III.,entertainment of strangers.
2075,BOOK III.,
2076,BOOK III.,"Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, they yoked"
2077,BOOK III.,the horses and mounted the inlaid car. And forth they drave from the
2078,BOOK III.,"gateway and the echoing gallery, and Peisistratus touched the horses"
2079,BOOK III.,"with the whip to start them, and the pair flew onward nothing loth. So"
2080,BOOK III.,"they came to the wheat-bearing plain, and thenceforth they pressed"
2081,BOOK III.,toward the end: in such wise did the swift horses speed forward. Now
2082,BOOK III.,the sun sank and all the ways were darkened.
2083,BOOK III.,
2084,BOOK III.,
2085,BOOK III.,
2086,BOOK IV.,BOOK IV.
2087,BOOK IV.,
2088,BOOK IV.,
2089,BOOK IV.,"Telemachus’ entertainment at Sparta, where Menelaus tells him what"
2090,BOOK IV.,befell many of the Greeks on their return; that Odysseus was with
2091,BOOK IV.,"Calypso in the isle Ogygia, as he was told by Proteus."
2092,BOOK IV.,
2093,BOOK IV.,
2094,BOOK IV.,"And they came to Lacedaemon lying low among the caverned hills, and"
2095,BOOK IV.,drave to the dwelling of renowned Menelaus. Him they found giving a
2096,BOOK IV.,"feast in his house to many friends of his kin, a feast for the wedding"
2097,BOOK IV.,of his noble son and daughter. His daughter he was sending to the son
2098,BOOK IV.,"of Achilles, cleaver of the ranks of men, for in Troy he first had"
2099,BOOK IV.,"promised and covenanted to give her, and now the gods were bringing"
2100,BOOK IV.,about their marriage. So now he was speeding her on her way with
2101,BOOK IV.,"chariot and horses, to the famous city of the Myrmidons, among whom her"
2102,BOOK IV.,lord bare rule. And for his son he was bringing to his home the
2103,BOOK IV.,"daughter of Alector out of Sparta, for his well-beloved son, strong"
2104,BOOK IV.,"Megapenthes,[7] born of a slave woman, for the gods no more showed"
2105,BOOK IV.,"promise of seed to Helen, from the day that she bare a lovely child,"
2106,BOOK IV.,"Hermione, as fair as golden Aphrodite. So they were feasting through"
2107,BOOK IV.,"the great vaulted hall, the neighbours and the kinsmen of renowned"
2108,BOOK IV.,"Menelaus, making merry; and among them a divine minstrel was singing to"
2109,BOOK IV.,"the lyre, and as he began the song two tumblers in the company whirled"
2110,BOOK IV.,through the midst of them.
2111,BOOK IV.,
2112,BOOK IV.,[7] A son of sorrow: Tristram.
2113,BOOK IV.,
2114,BOOK IV.,
2115,BOOK IV.,"Meanwhile those twain, the hero Telemachus and the splendid son of"
2116,BOOK IV.,"Nestor, made halt at the entry of the gate, they and their horses. And"
2117,BOOK IV.,"the lord Eteoneus came forth and saw them, the ready squire of renowned"
2118,BOOK IV.,Menelaus; and he went through the palace to bear the tidings to the
2119,BOOK IV.,"shepherd of the people, and standing near spake to him winged words:"
2120,BOOK IV.,
2121,BOOK IV.,"“Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, here are two strangers, whosoever they"
2122,BOOK IV.,"be, two men like to the lineage of great Zeus. Say, shall we loose"
2123,BOOK IV.,"their swift horses from under the yoke, or send them onward to some"
2124,BOOK IV.,other host who shall receive them kindly?”
2125,BOOK IV.,
2126,BOOK IV.,Then in sore displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair hair:
2127,BOOK IV.,"“Eteoneus son of Boethous, truly thou wert not a fool aforetime, but"
2128,BOOK IV.,"now for this once, like a child thou talkest folly. Surely ourselves"
2129,BOOK IV.,"ate much hospitable cheer of other men, ere we twain came hither, even"
2130,BOOK IV.,"if in time to come Zeus haply give us rest from affliction. Nay go,"
2131,BOOK IV.,"unyoke the horses of the strangers, and as for the men, lead them"
2132,BOOK IV.,forward to the house to feast with us.”
2133,BOOK IV.,
2134,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and Eteoneus hasted from the hall, and called the other"
2135,BOOK IV.,ready squires to follow with him. So they loosed the sweating horses
2136,BOOK IV.,"from beneath the yoke, and fastened them at the stalls of the horses,"
2137,BOOK IV.,"and threw beside them spelt, and therewith mixed white barley, and"
2138,BOOK IV.,"tilted the chariot against the shining faces of the gateway, and led"
2139,BOOK IV.,the men into the hall divine. And they beheld and marvelled as they
2140,BOOK IV.,"gazed throughout the palace of the king, the fosterling of Zeus; for"
2141,BOOK IV.,there was a gleam as it were of sun or moon through the lofty palace of
2142,BOOK IV.,"renowned Menelaus. But after they had gazed their fill, they went to"
2143,BOOK IV.,the polished baths and bathed them. Now when the maidens had bathed
2144,BOOK IV.,"them and anointed them with olive oil, and cast about them thick cloaks"
2145,BOOK IV.,"and doublets, they sat on chairs by Menelaus, son of Atreus. And a"
2146,BOOK IV.,"handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured"
2147,BOOK IV.,it forth over a silver basin to wash withal; and to their side she drew
2148,BOOK IV.,"a polished table, and a grave dame bare food and set it by them, and"
2149,BOOK IV.,"laid upon the board many dainties, giving freely of such things as she"
2150,BOOK IV.,"had by her, and a carver lifted and placed by them platters of divers"
2151,BOOK IV.,"kinds of flesh, and nigh them he set golden bowls. So Menelaus of the"
2152,BOOK IV.,fair hair greeted the twain and spake:
2153,BOOK IV.,
2154,BOOK IV.,"“Taste ye food and be glad, and thereafter when ye have supped, we will"
2155,BOOK IV.,"ask what men ye are; for the blood of your parents is not lost in you,"
2156,BOOK IV.,"but ye are of the line of men that are sceptred kings, the fosterlings"
2157,BOOK IV.,of Zeus; for no churls could beget sons like you.”
2158,BOOK IV.,
2159,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and took and set before them the fat ox-chine roasted,"
2160,BOOK IV.,which they had given him as his own mess by way of honour. And they
2161,BOOK IV.,stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set before them. Now
2162,BOOK IV.,when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink Telemachus
2163,BOOK IV.,"spake to the son of Nestor, holding his head close to him, that those"
2164,BOOK IV.,others might not hear:
2165,BOOK IV.,
2166,BOOK IV.,"“Son of Nestor, delight of my heart, mark the flashing of bronze"
2167,BOOK IV.,"through the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold and of amber and of"
2168,BOOK IV.,"silver and of ivory. Such like, methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus"
2169,BOOK IV.,"within, for the world of things that are here; wonder comes over me as"
2170,BOOK IV.,I look thereon.”
2171,BOOK IV.,
2172,BOOK IV.,"And as he spake Menelaus of the fair hair was ware of him, and uttering"
2173,BOOK IV.,his voice spake to them winged words:
2174,BOOK IV.,
2175,BOOK IV.,"“Children dear, of a truth no one of mortal men may contend with Zeus,"
2176,BOOK IV.,for his mansions and his treasures are everlasting: but of men there
2177,BOOK IV.,"may be who will vie with me in treasure, or there may be none. Yea, for"
2178,BOOK IV.,"after many a woe and wanderings manifold, I brought my wealth home in"
2179,BOOK IV.,"ships, and in the eighth year came hither. I roamed over Cyprus and"
2180,BOOK IV.,"Phoenicia and Egypt, and reached the Aethiopians and Sidonians and"
2181,BOOK IV.,"Erembi and Libya, where lambs are horned from the birth. For there the"
2182,BOOK IV.,ewes yean thrice within the full circle of a year; there neither lord
2183,BOOK IV.,"nor shepherd lacketh aught of cheese or flesh or of sweet milk, but"
2184,BOOK IV.,ever the flocks yield store of milk continual. While I was yet roaming
2185,BOOK IV.,"in those lands, gathering much livelihood, meantime another slew my"
2186,BOOK IV.,"brother privily, at unawares, by the guile of his accursed wife. Thus,"
2187,BOOK IV.,"look you, I have no joy of my lordship among these my possessions: and"
2188,BOOK IV.,"ye are like to have heard hereof from your fathers, whosoever they be,"
2189,BOOK IV.,for I have suffered much and let a house go to ruin that was stablished
2190,BOOK IV.,"fair, and had in it much choice substance. I would that I had but a"
2191,BOOK IV.,"third part of those my riches, and dwelt in my halls, and that those"
2192,BOOK IV.,"men were yet safe, who perished of old in the wide land of Troy, far"
2193,BOOK IV.,"from Argos, the pastureland of horses. Howbeit, though I bewail them"
2194,BOOK IV.,"all and sorrow oftentimes as I sit in our halls,—awhile indeed I"
2195,BOOK IV.,"satisfy my soul with lamentation, and then again I cease; for soon hath"
2196,BOOK IV.,"man enough of chill lamentation—yet for them all I make no such dole,"
2197,BOOK IV.,"despite my grief, as for one only, who causes me to loathe both sleep"
2198,BOOK IV.,"and meat, when I think upon him. For no one of the Achaeans toiled so"
2199,BOOK IV.,greatly as Odysseus toiled and adventured himself: but to him it was to
2200,BOOK IV.,"be but labour and trouble, and to me grief ever comfortless for his"
2201,BOOK IV.,"sake, so long he is afar, nor know we aught, whether he be alive or"
2202,BOOK IV.,"dead. Yea methinks they lament him, even that old Laertes and the"
2203,BOOK IV.,"constant Penelope and Telemachus, whom he left a child new-born in his"
2204,BOOK IV.,house.”
2205,BOOK IV.,
2206,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and in the heart of Telemachus he stirred a yearning to"
2207,BOOK IV.,lament his father; and at his father’s name he let a tear fall from his
2208,BOOK IV.,"eyelids to the ground, and held up his purple mantle with both his"
2209,BOOK IV.,hands before his eyes. And Menelaus marked him and mused in his mind
2210,BOOK IV.,"and his heart whether he should leave him to speak of his father, or"
2211,BOOK IV.,first question him and prove him in every word.
2212,BOOK IV.,
2213,BOOK IV.,"While yet he pondered these things in his mind and in his heart, Helen"
2214,BOOK IV.,"came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber, like Artemis of the"
2215,BOOK IV.,golden arrows; and with her came Adraste and set for her the
2216,BOOK IV.,"well-wrought chair, and Alcippe bare a rug of soft wool, and Phylo bare"
2217,BOOK IV.,"a silver basket which Alcandre gave her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt"
2218,BOOK IV.,"in Thebes of Egypt, where is the chiefest store of wealth in the"
2219,BOOK IV.,"houses. He gave two silver baths to Menelaus, and tripods twain, ad ten"
2220,BOOK IV.,"talents of gold. And besides all this, his wife bestowed on Helen"
2221,BOOK IV.,"lovely gifts; a golden distaff did she give, and a silver basket with"
2222,BOOK IV.,"wheels beneath, and the rims thereof were finished with gold. This it"
2223,BOOK IV.,"was that the handmaid Phylo bare and set beside her, filled with"
2224,BOOK IV.,"dressed yarn, and across it was laid a distaff charged with wool of"
2225,BOOK IV.,"violet blue. So Helen sat her down in the chair, and beneath was a"
2226,BOOK IV.,footstool for the feet. And anon she spake to her lord and questioned
2227,BOOK IV.,him of each thing:
2228,BOOK IV.,
2229,BOOK IV.,"“Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, know we now who these men avow"
2230,BOOK IV.,themselves to be that have come under our roof? Shall I dissemble or
2231,BOOK IV.,"shall I speak the truth? Nay, I am minded to tell it. None, I say, have"
2232,BOOK IV.,"I ever yet seen so like another, man or woman—wonder comes over me as I"
2233,BOOK IV.,"look on him—as this man is like the son of great-hearted Odysseus,"
2234,BOOK IV.,"Telemachus, whom he left a new born child in his house, when for the"
2235,BOOK IV.,"sake of me, shameless woman that I was, ye Achaeans came up under Troy"
2236,BOOK IV.,with bold war in your hearts.”
2237,BOOK IV.,
2238,BOOK IV.,"And Menelaus of the fair hair answered her, saying: “Now I too, lady,"
2239,BOOK IV.,mark the likeness even as thou tracest it. For such as these were his
2240,BOOK IV.,"feet, such his hands, and the glances of his eyes, and his head, and"
2241,BOOK IV.,"his hair withal. Yea, and even now I was speaking of Odysseus, as I"
2242,BOOK IV.,"remembered him, of all his woeful travail for my sake; when, lo, he let"
2243,BOOK IV.,"fall a bitter tear beneath his brows, and held his purple cloak up"
2244,BOOK IV.,before his eyes.”
2245,BOOK IV.,
2246,BOOK IV.,"And Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him, saying: “Menelaus, son"
2247,BOOK IV.,"of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, assuredly this is"
2248,BOOK IV.,"the son of that very man, even as thou sayest. But he is of a sober"
2249,BOOK IV.,"wit, and thinketh it shame in his heart as on this his first coming to"
2250,BOOK IV.,"make show of presumptuous words in the presence of thee, in whose voice"
2251,BOOK IV.,"we twain delight as in the voice of a god. Now Nestor of Gerenia, lord"
2252,BOOK IV.,"of chariots, sent me forth to be his guide on the way: for he desired"
2253,BOOK IV.,to see thee that thou mightest put into his heart some word or work.
2254,BOOK IV.,"For a son hath many griefs in his halls when his father is away, if"
2255,BOOK IV.,perchance he hath none to stand by him. Even so it is now with
2256,BOOK IV.,"Telemachus; his father is away, nor hath he others in the township to"
2257,BOOK IV.,defend him from distress.”
2258,BOOK IV.,
2259,BOOK IV.,"And Menelaus of the fair hair answered him, and said: “Lo now, in good"
2260,BOOK IV.,"truth there has come unto my house the son of a friend indeed, who for"
2261,BOOK IV.,my sake endured many adventures. And I thought to welcome him on his
2262,BOOK IV.,"coming more nobly than all the other Argives, if but Olympian Zeus, of"
2263,BOOK IV.,"the far-borne voice, had vouchsafed us a return over the sea in our"
2264,BOOK IV.,"swift ships,—that such a thing should be. And in Argos I would have"
2265,BOOK IV.,"given him a city to dwell in, and stablished for him a house, and"
2266,BOOK IV.,brought him forth from Ithaca with his substance and his son and all
2267,BOOK IV.,"his people, making one city desolate of those that lie around, and are"
2268,BOOK IV.,"in mine own domain. Then ofttimes would we have held converse here, and"
2269,BOOK IV.,"nought would have parted us, the welcoming and the welcomed,[8] ere the"
2270,BOOK IV.,"black cloud of death overshadowed us. Howsoever, the god himself,"
2271,BOOK IV.,"methinks, must have been jealous hereof, who from that hapless man"
2272,BOOK IV.,alone cut off his returning.”
2273,BOOK IV.,
2274,BOOK IV.,[8] Mr. Evelyn Abbott of Balliol College has suggested to us that
2275,BOOK IV.,"φιλέοντε and τερπομένω are here correlatives, and denote respectively"
2276,BOOK IV.,the parts of host and of guest. This is sufficiently borne out by the
2277,BOOK IV.,usage of the words elsewhere.
2278,BOOK IV.,
2279,BOOK IV.,
2280,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and in the hearts of all he stirred the desire of"
2281,BOOK IV.,"lamentation. She wept, even Argive Helen the daughter of Zeus, and"
2282,BOOK IV.,"Telemachus wept, and Menelaus the son of Atreus; nay, nor did the son"
2283,BOOK IV.,of Nestor keep tearless eyes. For he bethought him in his heart of
2284,BOOK IV.,"noble Antilochus, whom the glorious son of the bright Dawn had slain."
2285,BOOK IV.,Thinking upon him he spake winged words:
2286,BOOK IV.,
2287,BOOK IV.,"“Son of Atreus, the ancient Nestor in his own halls was ever wont to"
2288,BOOK IV.,"say that thou wert wise beyond man’s wisdom, whensoever we made mention"
2289,BOOK IV.,"of thee and asked one another concerning thee. And now, if it be"
2290,BOOK IV.,"possible, be persuaded by me, who for one have no pleasure in weeping"
2291,BOOK IV.,at supper time—the new-born day will right soon be upon us.[9] Not
2292,BOOK IV.,indeed that I deem it blame at all to weep for any mortal who hath died
2293,BOOK IV.,"and met his fate. Lo, this is now the only due we pay to miserable men,"
2294,BOOK IV.,to cut the hair and let the tear fall from the cheek. For I too have a
2295,BOOK IV.,"brother dead, nowise the meanest of the Argives, and thou art like to"
2296,BOOK IV.,"have known him, for as for me I never encountered him, never beheld"
2297,BOOK IV.,"him. But men say that Antilochus outdid all, being excellent in speed"
2298,BOOK IV.,of foot and in the fight.”
2299,BOOK IV.,
2300,BOOK IV.,[9] Cf. B. xv.50
2301,BOOK IV.,
2302,BOOK IV.,
2303,BOOK IV.,"And Menelaus of the fair hair answered him, and said: “My friend, lo,"
2304,BOOK IV.,"thou hast said all that a wise man might say or do, yea, and an elder"
2305,BOOK IV.,"than thou;—for from such a sire too thou art sprung, wherefore thou"
2306,BOOK IV.,"dost even speak wisely. Right easily known is that man’s seed, for whom"
2307,BOOK IV.,Cronion weaves the skein of luck at bridal and at birth: even as now
2308,BOOK IV.,"hath he granted prosperity to Nestor for ever for all his days, that he"
2309,BOOK IV.,"himself should grow into a smooth old age in his halls, and his sons"
2310,BOOK IV.,moreover should be wise and the best of spearsmen. But we will cease
2311,BOOK IV.,"now the weeping which was erewhile made, and let us once more bethink"
2312,BOOK IV.,"us of our supper, and let them pour water over our hands. And again in"
2313,BOOK IV.,the morning there will be tales for Telemachus and me to tell one to
2314,BOOK IV.,"the other, even to the end.”"
2315,BOOK IV.,
2316,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and Asphalion poured water over their hands, the ready"
2317,BOOK IV.,squire of renowned Menelaus. And they put forth their hands upon the
2318,BOOK IV.,good cheer spread before them.
2319,BOOK IV.,
2320,BOOK IV.,"Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts. Presently she"
2321,BOOK IV.,"cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank, a drug to lull all pain"
2322,BOOK IV.,"and anger, and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow. Whoso should drink"
2323,BOOK IV.,"a draught thereof, when it is mingled in the bowl, on that day he would"
2324,BOOK IV.,"let no tear fall down his cheeks, not though his mother and his father"
2325,BOOK IV.,"died, not though men slew his brother or dear son with the sword before"
2326,BOOK IV.,"his face, and his own eyes beheld it. Medicines of such virtue and so"
2327,BOOK IV.,"helpful had the daughter of Zeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon,"
2328,BOOK IV.,"had given her, a woman of Egypt, where earth the grain-giver yields"
2329,BOOK IV.,"herbs in greatest plenty, many that are healing in the cup, and many"
2330,BOOK IV.,"baneful. There each man is a leech skilled beyond all human kind; yea,"
2331,BOOK IV.,for they are of the race of Paeeon. Now after she had cast in the drug
2332,BOOK IV.,"and bidden pour forth of the wine, she made answer once again, and"
2333,BOOK IV.,spake unto her lord:
2334,BOOK IV.,
2335,BOOK IV.,"“Son of Atreus, Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, and lo, ye sons of noble"
2336,BOOK IV.,"men, forasmuch as now to one and now to another Zeus gives good and"
2337,BOOK IV.,"evil, for to him all things are possible,—now, verily, sit ye down and"
2338,BOOK IV.,"feast in the halls, and take ye joy in the telling of tales, and I will"
2339,BOOK IV.,tell you one that fits the time. Now all of them I could not tell or
2340,BOOK IV.,"number, so many as were the adventures of Odysseus of the hardy heart;"
2341,BOOK IV.,"but, ah, what a deed was this he wrought and dared in his hardiness in"
2342,BOOK IV.,"the land of the Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction. He"
2343,BOOK IV.,"subdued his body with unseemly stripes, and a sorry covering he cast"
2344,BOOK IV.,"about his shoulders, and in the fashion of a servant he went down into"
2345,BOOK IV.,"the wide-wayed city of the foemen, and he hid himself in the guise of"
2346,BOOK IV.,"another, a beggar, though in no wise such an one was he at the ships of"
2347,BOOK IV.,"the Achaeans. In this semblance he passed into the city of the Trojans,"
2348,BOOK IV.,"and they wist not who he was, and I alone knew him in that guise, and I"
2349,BOOK IV.,"kept questioning him, but in his subtlety he avoided me. But when at"
2350,BOOK IV.,"last I was about washing him and anointing him with olive oil, and had"
2351,BOOK IV.,"put on him raiment, and sworn a great oath not to reveal Odysseus amid"
2352,BOOK IV.,"the Trojans, ere he reached the swift ships and the huts, even then he"
2353,BOOK IV.,told me all the purpose of the Achaeans. And after slaying many of the
2354,BOOK IV.,"Trojans with the long sword, he returned to the Argives and brought"
2355,BOOK IV.,"back word again of all. Then the other Trojan women wept aloud, but my"
2356,BOOK IV.,"soul was glad, for already my heart was turned to go back again even to"
2357,BOOK IV.,my home: and now at the last I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite
2358,BOOK IV.,"gave me, when she led me thither away from mine own country, forsaking"
2359,BOOK IV.,"my child and my bridal chamber and my lord, that lacked not aught"
2360,BOOK IV.,whether for wisdom or yet for beauty.”
2361,BOOK IV.,
2362,BOOK IV.,"And Menelaus of the fair hair answered her, saying: “Verily all this"
2363,BOOK IV.,"tale, lady, thou hast duly told. Ere now have I learned the counsel and"
2364,BOOK IV.,"the thought of many heroes, and travelled over many a land, but never"
2365,BOOK IV.,yet have mine eyes beheld any such man of heart as was Odysseus; such
2366,BOOK IV.,another deed as he wrought and dared in his hardiness even in the
2367,BOOK IV.,"shapen horse, wherein sat all we chiefs of the Argives, bearing to the"
2368,BOOK IV.,"Trojans death and doom. Anon thou camest thither, and sure some god"
2369,BOOK IV.,"must have bidden thee, who wished to bring glory to the Trojans. Yea"
2370,BOOK IV.,and godlike Deiphobus went with thee on thy way. Thrice thou didst go
2371,BOOK IV.,"round about the hollow ambush and handle it, calling aloud on the"
2372,BOOK IV.,"chiefs of the Argives by name, and making thy voice like the voices of"
2373,BOOK IV.,the wives of all the Argives. Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly
2374,BOOK IV.,Odysseus sat in the midst and heard thy call; and verily we twain had a
2375,BOOK IV.,desire to start up and come forth or presently to answer from within;
2376,BOOK IV.,"but Odysseus stayed and held us there, despite our eagerness. Then all"
2377,BOOK IV.,"the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace, but Anticlus alone was"
2378,BOOK IV.,still minded to answer thee. Howbeit Odysseus firmly closed his mouth
2379,BOOK IV.,"with strong hands, and so saved all the Achaeans, and held him until"
2380,BOOK IV.,such time as Pallas Athene led thee back.”
2381,BOOK IV.,
2382,BOOK IV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: “Menelaus, son of Atreus,"
2383,BOOK IV.,"fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, all the more grievous it is!"
2384,BOOK IV.,"for in no way did this courage ward from him pitiful destruction, not"
2385,BOOK IV.,"though his heart within him had been very iron. But come, bid us to"
2386,BOOK IV.,"bed, that forthwith we may take our joy of rest beneath the spell of"
2387,BOOK IV.,sleep.”
2388,BOOK IV.,
2389,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and Argive Helen bade her handmaids set out bedsteads"
2390,BOOK IV.,"beneath the gallery, and fling on them fair purple blankets and spread"
2391,BOOK IV.,"coverlets above, and thereon lay thick mantles to be a clothing over"
2392,BOOK IV.,"all. So they went from the hall with torch in hand, and spread the"
2393,BOOK IV.,"beds, and the henchman led forth the guests. Thus they slept there in"
2394,BOOK IV.,"the vestibule of the house, the hero Telemachus and the splendid son of"
2395,BOOK IV.,"Nestor. But the son of Atreus slept, as his custom was, in the inmost"
2396,BOOK IV.,"chamber of the lofty house, and by him lay long-robed Helen, that fair"
2397,BOOK IV.,lady.
2398,BOOK IV.,
2399,BOOK IV.,"Soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, Menelaus of the loud"
2400,BOOK IV.,"war-shout gat him up from his bed and put on his raiment, and cast his"
2401,BOOK IV.,"sharp sword about his shoulder, and beneath his smooth feet bound his"
2402,BOOK IV.,"goodly sandals, and stept forth from his chamber, in presence like a"
2403,BOOK IV.,"god, and sat by Telemachus, and spake and hailed him:"
2404,BOOK IV.,
2405,BOOK IV.,"“To what end hath thy need brought thee hither, hero Telemachus, unto"
2406,BOOK IV.,"fair Lacedaemon, over the broad back of the sea? Is it a matter of the"
2407,BOOK IV.,common weal or of thine own? Herein tell me the plain truth.”
2408,BOOK IV.,
2409,BOOK IV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: “Menelaus, son of Atreus,"
2410,BOOK IV.,"fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, I have come if perchance thou"
2411,BOOK IV.,mayest tell me some tidings of my father. My dwelling is being devoured
2412,BOOK IV.,"and my fat lands are ruined, and of unfriendly men my house is"
2413,BOOK IV.,"full,—who slaughter continually my thronging flocks, and my kine with"
2414,BOOK IV.,"trailing feet and shambling gait,—none other than the wooers of my"
2415,BOOK IV.,"mother, despiteful out of measure. So now am I come hither to thy"
2416,BOOK IV.,"knees, if haply thou art willing to tell me of his pitiful death, as"
2417,BOOK IV.,"one that saw it perchance with thine own eyes, or heard the story from"
2418,BOOK IV.,some other wanderer; for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And
2419,BOOK IV.,"speak me no soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly how thou"
2420,BOOK IV.,"didst get sight of him. Ah, I pray thee, if ever at all my father, good"
2421,BOOK IV.,"Odysseus, made promise to thee of word or work and fulfilled the same"
2422,BOOK IV.,"in the land of the Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction,"
2423,BOOK IV.,"these things, I pray thee, now remember and tell me truth.”"
2424,BOOK IV.,
2425,BOOK IV.,Then in heavy displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair hair: “Out
2426,BOOK IV.,"upon them, for truly in the bed of a brave-hearted man were they minded"
2427,BOOK IV.,"to lie, very cravens as they are! Even as when a hind hath couched her"
2428,BOOK IV.,"newborn fawns unweaned in a strong lion’s lair, and searcheth out the"
2429,BOOK IV.,"mountain knees and grassy hollows, seeking pasture, and afterward the"
2430,BOOK IV.,"lion cometh back to his bed, and sendeth forth unsightly death upon"
2431,BOOK IV.,"that pair, even so shall Odysseus send forth unsightly death upon the"
2432,BOOK IV.,"wooers. Would to our father Zeus and Athene and Apollo, would that in"
2433,BOOK IV.,such might as when of old in stablished Lesbos he rose up and wrestled
2434,BOOK IV.,"a match with Philomeleides and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans"
2435,BOOK IV.,rejoiced; would that in such strength Odysseus might consort with the
2436,BOOK IV.,"wooers: then should they all have swift fate, and bitter wedlock! But"
2437,BOOK IV.,"for that whereof thou askest and entreatest me, be sure I will not"
2438,BOOK IV.,"swerve from the truth in aught that I say, nor deceive thee; but of all"
2439,BOOK IV.,"that the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth, declared to me,"
2440,BOOK IV.,not a word will I hide or keep from thee.
2441,BOOK IV.,
2442,BOOK IV.,"“In the river Aegyptus,[10] though eager I was to press onward home,"
2443,BOOK IV.,"the gods they stayed me, for that I had not offered them the acceptable"
2444,BOOK IV.,"sacrifice of hecatombs, and the gods ever desired that men should be"
2445,BOOK IV.,mindful of their commandments. Now there is an island in the wash of
2446,BOOK IV.,"the waves over against Aegyptus, and men call it Pharos, within one"
2447,BOOK IV.,"day’s voyage of a hollow ship, when shrill winds blow fair in her wake."
2448,BOOK IV.,"And therein is a good haven, whence men launch the gallant ships into"
2449,BOOK IV.,the deep when they have drawn a store of deep black water. There the
2450,BOOK IV.,"gods held me twenty days, nor did the sea-winds ever show their breath,"
2451,BOOK IV.,they that serve to waft ships over the broad back of the sea. And now
2452,BOOK IV.,"would all our corn have been spent, and likewise the strength of the"
2453,BOOK IV.,"men, except some goddess had taken pity on me and saved me, Eidothee,"
2454,BOOK IV.,"daughter of mighty Proteus, the ancient one of the sea. For most of all"
2455,BOOK IV.,"I moved her heart, when she met me wandering alone apart from my"
2456,BOOK IV.,"company, who were ever roaming round the isle, fishing with bent hooks,"
2457,BOOK IV.,"for hunger was gnawing at their belly. So she stood by, and spake and"
2458,BOOK IV.,uttered her voice saying:
2459,BOOK IV.,
2460,BOOK IV.,"[10] The only name for the Nile in Homer. Cf. Wilkinson, Ancient"
2461,BOOK IV.,"Egyptians (1878), vol. i. p. 7."
2462,BOOK IV.,
2463,BOOK IV.,
2464,BOOK IV.,"“‘Art thou so very foolish, stranger, and feeble-witted, or art thou"
2465,BOOK IV.,"wilfully remiss, and hast pleasure in suffering? So long time art thou"
2466,BOOK IV.,"holden in the isle and canst find no issue therefrom, while the heart"
2467,BOOK IV.,of thy company faileth within them?’
2468,BOOK IV.,
2469,BOOK IV.,"“Even so she spake, and I answered her saying: ‘I will speak forth,"
2470,BOOK IV.,"what goddess soever thou art, and tell thee that in no wise am I holden"
2471,BOOK IV.,"here by mine own will, but it needs must be that I have sinned against"
2472,BOOK IV.,"the deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven. Howbeit, do thou tell"
2473,BOOK IV.,me—for the gods know all things—which of the immortals it is that binds
2474,BOOK IV.,"me here and hath hindered me from my way, and declare as touching my"
2475,BOOK IV.,returning how I may go over the teeming deep.’
2476,BOOK IV.,
2477,BOOK IV.,"“So I spake, and straightway the fair goddess made answer: ‘Yea now,"
2478,BOOK IV.,"sir, I will plainly tell thee all. Hither resorteth that ancient one of"
2479,BOOK IV.,"the sea, whose speech is sooth, the deathless Egyptian Proteus, who"
2480,BOOK IV.,"knows the depths of every sea, and is the thrall of Poseidon, and who,"
2481,BOOK IV.,"they say, is my father that begat me. If thou couldst but lay an ambush"
2482,BOOK IV.,"and catch him, he will surely declare to thee the way and the measure"
2483,BOOK IV.,"of thy path, and will tell thee of thy returning, how thou mayest go"
2484,BOOK IV.,"over the teeming deep. Yea, and he will show thee, O fosterling of"
2485,BOOK IV.,"Zeus, if thou wilt, what good thing and what evil hath been wrought in"
2486,BOOK IV.,"thy halls, whilst thou has been faring this long and grievous way.’"
2487,BOOK IV.,
2488,BOOK IV.,"“So she spake, but I answered and said unto her: ‘Devise now thyself"
2489,BOOK IV.,"the ambush to take this ancient one divine, lest by any chance he see"
2490,BOOK IV.,"me first, or know of my coming, and avoid me. For a god is hard for"
2491,BOOK IV.,mortal man to quell.’
2492,BOOK IV.,
2493,BOOK IV.,"“So spake I, and straightway the fair goddess made answer: ‘Yea now,"
2494,BOOK IV.,"sir, I will plainly tell thee all. So often as the sun in his course"
2495,BOOK IV.,"stands high in mid heaven, then forth from the brine comes the ancient"
2496,BOOK IV.,"one of the sea, whose speech is sooth, before the breath of the West"
2497,BOOK IV.,"Wind he comes, and the sea’s dark ripple covers him. And when he is got"
2498,BOOK IV.,"forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow of the caves. And around him"
2499,BOOK IV.,"the seals, the brood of the fair daughter of the brine, sleep all in a"
2500,BOOK IV.,"flock, stolen forth from the grey sea water, and bitter is the scent"
2501,BOOK IV.,they breathe of the deeps of the salt sea. There will I lead thee at
2502,BOOK IV.,"the breaking of the day, and couch you all orderly; so do thou choose"
2503,BOOK IV.,"diligently three of thy company, the best thou hast in thy decked"
2504,BOOK IV.,"ships. And I will tell thee all the magic arts of that old man. First,"
2505,BOOK IV.,he will number the seals and go over them; but when he has told their
2506,BOOK IV.,"tale and beheld them, he will lay him down in the midst, as a shepherd"
2507,BOOK IV.,"mid the sheep of his flock. So soon as ever ye shall see him couched,"
2508,BOOK IV.,"even then mind you of your might and strength, and hold him there,"
2509,BOOK IV.,"despite his eagerness and striving to be free. And he will make assay,"
2510,BOOK IV.,"and take all manner of shapes of things that creep upon the earth, of"
2511,BOOK IV.,"water likewise, and of fierce fire burning. But do ye grasp him"
2512,BOOK IV.,"steadfastly and press him yet the more, and at length when he questions"
2513,BOOK IV.,"thee in his proper shape, as he was when first ye saw him laid to rest,"
2514,BOOK IV.,"then, hero, hold thy strong hands, and let the ancient one go free, and"
2515,BOOK IV.,"ask him which of the gods is hard upon thee, and as touching thy"
2516,BOOK IV.,"returning, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep.’"
2517,BOOK IV.,
2518,BOOK IV.,"“Therewith she dived beneath the heaving sea, but I betook me to the"
2519,BOOK IV.,"ships where they stood in the sand, and my heart was darkly troubled as"
2520,BOOK IV.,"I went. But after I had come down to the ship and to the sea, and we"
2521,BOOK IV.,"had made ready our supper and immortal night had come on, then did we"
2522,BOOK IV.,"lay us to rest upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth,"
2523,BOOK IV.,"the rosy fingered, in that hour I walked by the shore of the wide-wayed"
2524,BOOK IV.,"sea, praying instantly to the gods; and I took with me three of my"
2525,BOOK IV.,"company, in whom I trusted most for every enterprise."
2526,BOOK IV.,
2527,BOOK IV.,"“Meanwhile, so it was that she had plunged into the broad bosom of the"
2528,BOOK IV.,"sea, and had brought from the deep the skins of four sea-calves, and"
2529,BOOK IV.,"all were newly flayed, for she was minded to lay a snare for her"
2530,BOOK IV.,"father. She scooped lairs on the sea-sand, and sat awaiting us, and we"
2531,BOOK IV.,"drew very nigh her, and she made us all lie down in order, and cast a"
2532,BOOK IV.,"skin over each. There would our ambush have been most terrible, for the"
2533,BOOK IV.,"deadly stench of the sea bred seals distressed us sore: nay, who would"
2534,BOOK IV.,lay him down by a beast of the sea? But herself she wrought
2535,BOOK IV.,"deliverance, and devised a great comfort. She took ambrosia of a very"
2536,BOOK IV.,"sweet savour, and set it beneath each man’s nostril, and did away with"
2537,BOOK IV.,the stench of the beast. So all the morning we waited with steadfast
2538,BOOK IV.,"heart, and the seals came forth in troops from the brine, and then they"
2539,BOOK IV.,couched them all orderly by the sea-beach. And at high day the ancient
2540,BOOK IV.,"one came forth from out of the brine, and found his fatted seals, yea"
2541,BOOK IV.,and he went along their line and told their tale; and first among the
2542,BOOK IV.,"sea-beasts he reckoned us, and guessed not that there was guile, and"
2543,BOOK IV.,"afterward he too laid him down. Then we rushed upon him with a cry, and"
2544,BOOK IV.,"cast our hands about him, nor did that ancient one forget his cunning."
2545,BOOK IV.,"Now behold, at the first he turned into a bearded lion, and thereafter"
2546,BOOK IV.,"into a snake, and a pard, and a huge boar; then he took the shape of"
2547,BOOK IV.,"running water, and of a tall and flowering tree. We the while held him"
2548,BOOK IV.,close with steadfast heart. But when now that ancient one of the magic
2549,BOOK IV.,"arts was aweary, then at last he questioned me and spake unto me,"
2550,BOOK IV.,saying:
2551,BOOK IV.,
2552,BOOK IV.,"“‘Which of the gods was it, son of Atreus, that aided thee with his"
2553,BOOK IV.,"counsel, that thou mightest waylay and take me perforce? What wouldest"
2554,BOOK IV.,thou thereby?’
2555,BOOK IV.,
2556,BOOK IV.,"“Even so he spake, but I answered him saying; ‘Old man, thou knowest"
2557,BOOK IV.,"all, wherefore dost thou question me thereof with crooked words? For"
2558,BOOK IV.,"lo, I am holden long time in this isle, neither can I find any issue"
2559,BOOK IV.,"therefrom, and my heart faileth within me. Howbeit do thou tell me—for"
2560,BOOK IV.,the gods know all things—which of the immortals it is that bindeth me
2561,BOOK IV.,"here, and hath hindered me from my way; and declare as touching my"
2562,BOOK IV.,"returning, how I may go over the teeming deep.’"
2563,BOOK IV.,
2564,BOOK IV.,"“Even so I spake, and he straightway answered me, saying: ‘Nay, surely"
2565,BOOK IV.,thou shouldest have done goodly sacrifice to Zeus and the other gods
2566,BOOK IV.,"ere thine embarking, that with most speed thou mightst reach thy"
2567,BOOK IV.,"country, sailing over the wine-dark deep. For it is not thy fate to see"
2568,BOOK IV.,"thy friends, and come to thy stablished house and thine own country,"
2569,BOOK IV.,"till thou hast passed yet again within the waters of Aegyptus, the"
2570,BOOK IV.,"heaven-fed stream, and offered holy hecatombs to the deathless gods who"
2571,BOOK IV.,keep the wide heaven. So shall the gods grant thee the path which thou
2572,BOOK IV.,desirest.’
2573,BOOK IV.,
2574,BOOK IV.,"“So spake he, but my spirit within me was broken, for that he bade me"
2575,BOOK IV.,"again to go to Aegyptus over the misty deep, a long and grievous way."
2576,BOOK IV.,
2577,BOOK IV.,"“Yet even so I answered him saying: ‘Old man, all this will I do,"
2578,BOOK IV.,"according to thy word. But come, declare me this, and tell it all"
2579,BOOK IV.,"plainly. Did all those Achaeans return safe with their ships, all whom"
2580,BOOK IV.,"Nestor and I left as we went from Troy, or perished any by a shameful"
2581,BOOK IV.,"death aboard his own ship, or in the arms of his friends, after he had"
2582,BOOK IV.,wound up the clew of war?’
2583,BOOK IV.,
2584,BOOK IV.,"“So spake I, and anon he answered me, saying: ‘Son of Atreus, why dost"
2585,BOOK IV.,"thou straitly question me hereof? Nay, it is not for thy good to know"
2586,BOOK IV.,"or learn my thought; for I tell thee thou shalt not long be tearless,"
2587,BOOK IV.,"when thou hast heard it all aright. For many of these were taken, and"
2588,BOOK IV.,many were left; but two only of the leaders of the mail-coated Achaeans
2589,BOOK IV.,"perished in returning; as for the battle, thou thyself wast there. And"
2590,BOOK IV.,"one methinks is yet alive, and is holden on the wide deep. Aias in"
2591,BOOK IV.,truth was smitten in the midst of his ships of the long oars. Poseidon
2592,BOOK IV.,"at first brought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and delivered"
2593,BOOK IV.,"him from the sea. And so he would have fled his doom, albeit hated by"
2594,BOOK IV.,"Athene, had he not let a proud word fall in the fatal darkening of his"
2595,BOOK IV.,heart. He said that in the gods’ despite he had escaped the great gulf
2596,BOOK IV.,"of the sea; and Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught"
2597,BOOK IV.,"up his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock Gyraean and"
2598,BOOK IV.,"cleft it in twain. And the one part abode in his place, but the other"
2599,BOOK IV.,"fell into the sea, the broken piece whereon Aias sat at the first, when"
2600,BOOK IV.,his heart was darkened. And the rock bore him down into the vast and
2601,BOOK IV.,heaving deep; so there he perished when he had drunk of the salt sea
2602,BOOK IV.,water. But thy brother verily escaped the fates and avoided them in his
2603,BOOK IV.,"hollow ships, for queen Hera saved him. But now when he was like soon"
2604,BOOK IV.,"to reach the steep mount of Malea, lo, the storm wind snatched him away"
2605,BOOK IV.,"and bore him over the teeming deep, making great moan, to the border of"
2606,BOOK IV.,"the country whereof old Thyestes dwelt, but now Aegisthus abode there,"
2607,BOOK IV.,the son of Thyestes. But when thence too there showed a good prospect
2608,BOOK IV.,"of safe returning, and the gods changed the wind to a fair gale, and"
2609,BOOK IV.,"they had reached home, then verily did Agamemnon set foot with joy upon"
2610,BOOK IV.,"his country’s soil, and as he touched his own land he kissed it, and"
2611,BOOK IV.,"many were the hot tears he let fall, for he saw his land and was glad."
2612,BOOK IV.,"And it was so that the watchman spied him from his tower, the watchman"
2613,BOOK IV.,"whom crafty Aegisthus had led and posted there, promising him for a"
2614,BOOK IV.,"reward two talents of gold. Now he kept watch for the space of a year,"
2615,BOOK IV.,"lest Agamemnon should pass by him when he looked not, and mind him of"
2616,BOOK IV.,his wild prowess. So he went to the house to bear the tidings to the
2617,BOOK IV.,shepherd of the people. And straightway Aegisthus contrived a cunning
2618,BOOK IV.,"treason. He chose out twenty of the best men in the township, and set"
2619,BOOK IV.,"an ambush, and on the further side of the hall he commanded to prepare"
2620,BOOK IV.,a feast. Then with chariot and horses he went to bid to the feast
2621,BOOK IV.,"Agamemnon, shepherd of the people; but caitiff thoughts were in his"
2622,BOOK IV.,"heart. He brought him up to his house, all unwitting of his doom, and"
2623,BOOK IV.,"when he had feasted him slew him, as one slayeth an ox at the stall."
2624,BOOK IV.,And none of the company of Atreides that were of his following were
2625,BOOK IV.,"left, nor any of the men of Aegisthus, but they were all killed in the"
2626,BOOK IV.,halls.’
2627,BOOK IV.,
2628,BOOK IV.,"“So spake he, and my spirit within me was broken, and I wept as I sat"
2629,BOOK IV.,"upon the sand, nor was I minded any more to live and see the light of"
2630,BOOK IV.,the sun. But when I had taken my fill of weeping and grovelling on the
2631,BOOK IV.,"ground, then spake the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth:"
2632,BOOK IV.,
2633,BOOK IV.,"“‘No more, son of Atreus, hold this long weeping without cease, for we"
2634,BOOK IV.,shall find no help therein. Rather with all haste make essay that so
2635,BOOK IV.,thou mayest come to thine own country. For either thou shalt find
2636,BOOK IV.,"Aegisthus yet alive, or it may be Orestes was beforehand with thee and"
2637,BOOK IV.,slew him; so mayest thou chance upon his funeral feast.’
2638,BOOK IV.,
2639,BOOK IV.,"“So he spake, and my heart and lordly soul again were comforted for all"
2640,BOOK IV.,"my sorrow, and I uttered my voice and I spake to him winged words:"
2641,BOOK IV.,
2642,BOOK IV.,“‘Their fate I now know; but tell me of the third; who is it that is
2643,BOOK IV.,"yet living and holden on the wide deep, or perchance is dead? and fain"
2644,BOOK IV.,would I hear despite my sorrow.’
2645,BOOK IV.,
2646,BOOK IV.,"“So spake I, and straightway he answered, and said: ‘It is the son of"
2647,BOOK IV.,"Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; and I saw him in an island"
2648,BOOK IV.,"shedding big tears in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who holds him"
2649,BOOK IV.,"there perforce; so he may not come to his own country, for he has by"
2650,BOOK IV.,"him no ships with oars, and no companions to send him on his way over"
2651,BOOK IV.,"the broad back of the sea. But thou, Menelaus, son of Zeus, art not"
2652,BOOK IV.,"ordained to die and meet thy fate in Argos, the pasture-land of horses,"
2653,BOOK IV.,but the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian plain and the
2654,BOOK IV.,"world’s end, where is Rhadamanthus of the fair hair, where life is"
2655,BOOK IV.,"easiest for men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain;"
2656,BOOK IV.,but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill West to blow
2657,BOOK IV.,"cool on men; yea, for thou hast Helen to wife, and thereby they deem"
2658,BOOK IV.,thee to be son of Zeus.’
2659,BOOK IV.,
2660,BOOK IV.,"“So spake he, and plunged into the heaving sea; but I betook me to the"
2661,BOOK IV.,"ships with my godlike company, and my heart was darkly troubled as I"
2662,BOOK IV.,"went. Now after I had come down to the ship and to the sea, and had"
2663,BOOK IV.,"made ready our supper, and immortal night had come on, then did we lay"
2664,BOOK IV.,"us to rest upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the"
2665,BOOK IV.,"rosy-fingered, first of all we drew down our ships to the fair salt sea"
2666,BOOK IV.,"and placed the masts and the sails in the gallant ships, and the crew"
2667,BOOK IV.,"too climbed on board, and sat upon the benches and smote the grey sea"
2668,BOOK IV.,"water with their oars. Then back I went to the waters of Aegyptus, the"
2669,BOOK IV.,"heaven-fed stream, and there I moored the ships and offered the"
2670,BOOK IV.,acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs. So when I had appeased the anger of
2671,BOOK IV.,"the everlasting gods, I piled a barrow to Agamemnon, that his fame"
2672,BOOK IV.,"might never be quenched. So having fulfilled all, I set out for home,"
2673,BOOK IV.,"and the deathless gods gave me a fair wind, and brought me swiftly to"
2674,BOOK IV.,"mine own dear country. But lo, now tarry in my halls till it shall be"
2675,BOOK IV.,the eleventh day hence or the twelfth. Then will I send thee with all
2676,BOOK IV.,"honour on thy way, and give thee splendid gifts, three horses and a"
2677,BOOK IV.,"polished car; and moreover I will give thee a goodly chalice, that thou"
2678,BOOK IV.,"mayest pour forth before the deathless gods, and be mindful of me all"
2679,BOOK IV.,the days of thy life.”
2680,BOOK IV.,
2681,BOOK IV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Son of Atreus, nay, hold me"
2682,BOOK IV.,not long time here. Yea even for a year would I be content to sit by
2683,BOOK IV.,"thee, and no desire for home or parents would come upon me; for I take"
2684,BOOK IV.,wondrous pleasure in thy tales and talk. But already my company
2685,BOOK IV.,"wearieth in fair Pylos, and yet thou art keeping me long time here. And"
2686,BOOK IV.,"whatsoever gift thou wouldest give me, let it be a thing to treasure;"
2687,BOOK IV.,"but horses I will take none to Ithaca, but leave them here to grace"
2688,BOOK IV.,"thine own house, for thou art lord of a wide plain wherein is lotus"
2689,BOOK IV.,"great plenty, and therein is spear-reed and wheat and rye, and white"
2690,BOOK IV.,"and spreading barley. In Ithaca there are no wide courses, nor meadow"
2691,BOOK IV.,"land at all. It is a pasture-land of goats, and more pleasant in my"
2692,BOOK IV.,sight than one that pastureth horses; for of the isles that lie and
2693,BOOK IV.,"lean upon the sea, none are fit for the driving of horses, or rich in"
2694,BOOK IV.,"meadow land, and least of all is Ithaca.”"
2695,BOOK IV.,
2696,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and Menelaus, of the loud war cry, smiled, and caressed"
2697,BOOK IV.,"him with his hand, and spake and hailed him:"
2698,BOOK IV.,
2699,BOOK IV.,"“Thou art of gentle blood, dear child, so gentle the words thou"
2700,BOOK IV.,"speakest. Therefore I will make exchange of the presents, as I may. Of"
2701,BOOK IV.,"the gifts, such as are treasures stored in my house, I will give thee"
2702,BOOK IV.,the goodliest and greatest of price. I will give thee a mixing bowl
2703,BOOK IV.,"beautifully wrought; it is all of silver, and the lips thereof are"
2704,BOOK IV.,"finished with gold, the work of Hephaestus; and the hero Phaedimus, the"
2705,BOOK IV.,"king of the Sidonians, gave it me, when his house sheltered me on my"
2706,BOOK IV.,"coming thither, and to thee now would I give it.”"
2707,BOOK IV.,
2708,BOOK IV.,"Even so they spake one to another, while the guests came to the palace"
2709,BOOK IV.,"of the divine king. They drave their sheep, and brought wine that"
2710,BOOK IV.,maketh glad the heart of man: and their wives with fair tire sent them
2711,BOOK IV.,wheaten bread. Thus were these men preparing the feast in the halls.
2712,BOOK IV.,
2713,BOOK IV.,"But the wooers meantime were before the palace of Odysseus, taking"
2714,BOOK IV.,"their pleasure in casting of weights and spears, on a levelled place,"
2715,BOOK IV.,"as heretofore, in their insolence. And Antinous and god-like Eurymachus"
2716,BOOK IV.,"were seated there, the chief men of the wooers, who were far the most"
2717,BOOK IV.,"excellent of all. And Noëmon, son of Phromius, drew nigh to them and"
2718,BOOK IV.,"spake unto Antinous and questioned him, saying:"
2719,BOOK IV.,
2720,BOOK IV.,"“Antinous, know we at all, or know we not, when Telemachus will return"
2721,BOOK IV.,"from sandy Pylos? He hath departed with a ship of mine, and I have need"
2722,BOOK IV.,"thereof, to cross over into spacious Elis, where I have twelve brood"
2723,BOOK IV.,mares with hardy mules unbroken at the teat; I would drive off one of
2724,BOOK IV.,these and break him in.”
2725,BOOK IV.,
2726,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and they were amazed, for they deemed not that Telemachus"
2727,BOOK IV.,"had gone to Neleian Pylos, but that he was at home somewhere in the"
2728,BOOK IV.,"fields, whether among the flocks, or with the swineherd."
2729,BOOK IV.,
2730,BOOK IV.,"Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake to him in turn: “Tell me the"
2731,BOOK IV.,"plain truth; when did he go, and what noble youths went with him? Were"
2732,BOOK IV.,they chosen men of Ithaca or hirelings and thralls of his own? He was
2733,BOOK IV.,"in case to bring even that about. And tell me this in good sooth, that"
2734,BOOK IV.,I may know for a surety: did he take thy black ship from thee perforce
2735,BOOK IV.,against thy will? or didst thou give it him of free will at his
2736,BOOK IV.,entreaty?
2737,BOOK IV.,
2738,BOOK IV.,"Then Noëmon, son of Phromius, answered him saying: “I gave it him"
2739,BOOK IV.,"myself of free will. What can any man do, when such an one, so bestead"
2740,BOOK IV.,"with care, begs a favour? it were hard to deny the gift. The youths who"
2741,BOOK IV.,"next to us are noblest in the land, even these have gone with him; and"
2742,BOOK IV.,"I marked their leader on board ship, Mentor, or a god who in all things"
2743,BOOK IV.,resembled Mentor. But one matter I marvel at: I saw the goodly Mentor
2744,BOOK IV.,"here yesterday toward dawn, though already he had embarked for Pylos.”"
2745,BOOK IV.,
2746,BOOK IV.,He spake and withal departed to his father’s house. And the proud
2747,BOOK IV.,"spirits of these twain were angered, and they made the wooers sit down"
2748,BOOK IV.,"together and cease from their games. And among them spake Antinous, son"
2749,BOOK IV.,"of Eupeithes, in displeasure; and his black heart was wholly filled"
2750,BOOK IV.,"with rage, and his eyes were like flaming fire:"
2751,BOOK IV.,
2752,BOOK IV.,"“Out on him, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished with a high"
2753,BOOK IV.,"hand, even this journey, and we thought that he would never bring it to"
2754,BOOK IV.,"pass! This lad hath clean gone without more ado, in spite of us all;"
2755,BOOK IV.,"his ship he hath let haul to the sea, and chosen the noblest in the"
2756,BOOK IV.,township. He will begin to be our bane even more than heretofore; but
2757,BOOK IV.,"may Zeus destroy his might, not ours, ere he reach the measure of"
2758,BOOK IV.,"manhood! But come, give me a swift ship and twenty men, that I may lie"
2759,BOOK IV.,"in watch and wait even for him on his way home, in the strait between"
2760,BOOK IV.,"Ithaca and rugged Samos, that so he may have a woeful end of his"
2761,BOOK IV.,cruising in quest of his father.”
2762,BOOK IV.,
2763,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and they all assented thereto, and bade him to the work."
2764,BOOK IV.,And thereupon they arose and went to the house of Odysseus.
2765,BOOK IV.,
2766,BOOK IV.,Now it was no long time before Penelope heard of the counsel that the
2767,BOOK IV.,wooers had devised in the deep of their heart. For the henchman Medon
2768,BOOK IV.,"told her thereof, who stood without the court and heard their purposes,"
2769,BOOK IV.,while they were weaving their plot within. So he went on his way
2770,BOOK IV.,through the halls to bring the news to Penelope; and as he stept down
2771,BOOK IV.,"over the threshold, Penelope spake unto him:"
2772,BOOK IV.,
2773,BOOK IV.,"“Henchman, wherefore have the noble wooers sent thee forth? Was it to"
2774,BOOK IV.,"tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their work, and"
2775,BOOK IV.,"prepare a banquet for them? Nay, after thus much wooing, never again"
2776,BOOK IV.,"may they come together, but here this day sup for their last and latest"
2777,BOOK IV.,"time; all ye who assemble so often, and waste much livelihood, the"
2778,BOOK IV.,"wealth of wise Telemachus! Long ago when ye were children, ye marked"
2779,BOOK IV.,"not your fathers’ telling, what manner of man was Odysseus among them,"
2780,BOOK IV.,"one that wrought no iniquity toward any man, nor spake aught"
2781,BOOK IV.,"unrighteous in the township, as is the wont of divine kings. One man a"
2782,BOOK IV.,"king is like to hate, another he might chance to love. But never did he"
2783,BOOK IV.,"do aught at all presumptuously to any man. Nay, it is plain what spirit"
2784,BOOK IV.,"ye are of, and your unseemly deeds are manifest to all, nor is there"
2785,BOOK IV.,any gratitude left for kindness done.”
2786,BOOK IV.,
2787,BOOK IV.,"Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “Would, oh queen, that this"
2788,BOOK IV.,were the crowning evil! But the wooers devise another far greater and
2789,BOOK IV.,"more grievous, which I pray the son of Cronos may never fulfil! They"
2790,BOOK IV.,are set on slaying Telemachus with the edge of the sword on his
2791,BOOK IV.,"homeward way; for he is gone to fair Pylos and goodly Lacedaemon, to"
2792,BOOK IV.,seek tidings of his father.”
2793,BOOK IV.,
2794,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, but her knees were loosened where she stood, and her heart"
2795,BOOK IV.,"melted within her, and long time was she speechless, and lo, her eyes"
2796,BOOK IV.,were filled with tears and the voice of her utterance was stayed. And
2797,BOOK IV.,at the last she answered him and said:
2798,BOOK IV.,
2799,BOOK IV.,"“Henchman, wherefore I pray thee is my son departed? There is no need"
2800,BOOK IV.,"that he should go abroad on swift ships, that serve men for horses on"
2801,BOOK IV.,"the sea, and that cross the great wet waste. Is it that even his own"
2802,BOOK IV.,name may no more be left upon earth?”
2803,BOOK IV.,
2804,BOOK IV.,"Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I know not whether some god"
2805,BOOK IV.,set him on or whether his own spirit stirred him to go to Pylos to seek
2806,BOOK IV.,"tidings of his father’s return, or to hear what end he met.”"
2807,BOOK IV.,
2808,BOOK IV.,"He spake, and departed through the house of Odysseus, and on her fell a"
2809,BOOK IV.,cloud of consuming grief; so that she might no more endure to seat her
2810,BOOK IV.,"on a chair, whereof there were many in the house, but there she"
2811,BOOK IV.,"crouched on the threshold of her well-builded chamber, wailing"
2812,BOOK IV.,"piteously, and her handmaids round her made low moan, as many as were"
2813,BOOK IV.,"in the house with her, young and old. And Penelope spake among them"
2814,BOOK IV.,pouring forth her lamentation:
2815,BOOK IV.,
2816,BOOK IV.,"“Hear me, my friends, for the Olympian sire hath given me pain"
2817,BOOK IV.,exceedingly beyond all women who were born and bred in my day. For
2818,BOOK IV.,"erewhile I lost my noble lord of the lion heart, adorned with all"
2819,BOOK IV.,"perfection among the Danaans, my good lord, whose fame is noised abroad"
2820,BOOK IV.,from Hellas to mid Argos. And now again the storm-winds have snatched
2821,BOOK IV.,"away my well-beloved son without tidings from our halls, nor heard I of"
2822,BOOK IV.,"his departure. Oh, women, hard of heart, that even ye did not each one"
2823,BOOK IV.,"let the thought come into your minds, to rouse me from my couch when he"
2824,BOOK IV.,"went to the black hollow ship, though ye knew full well thereof! For"
2825,BOOK IV.,"had I heard that he was purposing this journey, verily he should have"
2826,BOOK IV.,"stayed here still, though eager to be gone, or have left me dead in the"
2827,BOOK IV.,"halls. Howbeit let some one make haste to call the ancient Dolius, my"
2828,BOOK IV.,"thrall, whom my father gave me ere yet I had come hither, who keepeth"
2829,BOOK IV.,"my garden of trees. So shall he go straightway and sit by Laertes, and"
2830,BOOK IV.,"tell him all, if perchance Laertes may weave some counsel in his heart,"
2831,BOOK IV.,"and go forth and make his plaint to the people, who are purposed to"
2832,BOOK IV.,"destroy his seed, and the seed of god-like Odysseus.”"
2833,BOOK IV.,
2834,BOOK IV.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: “Dear lady, aye, slay me if"
2835,BOOK IV.,thou wilt with the pitiless sword or let me yet live on in the
2836,BOOK IV.,"house,—yet will I not hide my saying from thee. I knew all this, and"
2837,BOOK IV.,"gave him whatsoever he commanded, bread and sweet wine. And he took a"
2838,BOOK IV.,great oath of me not to tell thee till at least the twelfth day should
2839,BOOK IV.,"come, or thou thyself shouldst miss him and hear of his departure, that"
2840,BOOK IV.,"thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with thy tears. But now, wash thee"
2841,BOOK IV.,"in water, and take to thee clean raiment and ascend to thy upper"
2842,BOOK IV.,"chamber with the women thy handmaids, and pray to Athene, daughter of"
2843,BOOK IV.,"Zeus, lord of the aegis. For so may she save him even from death. And"
2844,BOOK IV.,heap not troubles on an old man’s trouble; for the seed of the son of
2845,BOOK IV.,"Arceisius, is not, methinks, utterly hated by the blessed gods, but"
2846,BOOK IV.,"someone will haply yet remain to possess these lofty halls, and the fat"
2847,BOOK IV.,fields far away.”
2848,BOOK IV.,
2849,BOOK IV.,"So spake she, and lulled her queen’s lamentation, and made her eyes to"
2850,BOOK IV.,"cease from weeping. So she washed her in water, and took to her clean"
2851,BOOK IV.,"raiment, and ascended to the upper chamber with the women her"
2852,BOOK IV.,"handmaids, and placed the meal for sprinkling in a basket, and prayed"
2853,BOOK IV.,unto Athene:
2854,BOOK IV.,
2855,BOOK IV.,"“Hear me, child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied maiden! If ever"
2856,BOOK IV.,wise Odysseus in his halls burnt for thee fat slices of the thighs of
2857,BOOK IV.,"heifer or of sheep, these things, I pray thee, now remember, and save"
2858,BOOK IV.,"my dear son, and ward from him the wooers in the naughtiness of their"
2859,BOOK IV.,pride.”
2860,BOOK IV.,
2861,BOOK IV.,"Therewith she raised a cry, and the goddess heard her prayer. But the"
2862,BOOK IV.,"wooers clamoured through the shadowy halls, and thus would some proud"
2863,BOOK IV.,youth say:
2864,BOOK IV.,
2865,BOOK IV.,"“Verily this queen of many wooers prepareth our marriage, nor knoweth"
2866,BOOK IV.,at all how that for her son death hath been ordained.”
2867,BOOK IV.,
2868,BOOK IV.,"Thus would certain of them speak, but they knew not how these things"
2869,BOOK IV.,were ordained. And Antinous made harangue and spake among them:
2870,BOOK IV.,
2871,BOOK IV.,"“Good sirs, my friends, shun all disdainful words alike, lest someone"
2872,BOOK IV.,"hear and tell it even in the house. But come let us arise, and in"
2873,BOOK IV.,"silence accomplish that whereof we spake, for the counsel pleased us"
2874,BOOK IV.,every one.”
2875,BOOK IV.,
2876,BOOK IV.,"Therewith he chose twenty men that were the best, and they departed to"
2877,BOOK IV.,the swift ship and the sea-banks. So first of all they drew the ship
2878,BOOK IV.,"down to the deep water, and placed the mast and sails in the black"
2879,BOOK IV.,"ship, and fixed the oars in leathern loops all orderly, and spread"
2880,BOOK IV.,"forth the white sails. And squires, haughty of heart, bare for them"
2881,BOOK IV.,"their arms. And they moored her high out in the shore water, and"
2882,BOOK IV.,themselves disembarked. There they supped and waited for evening to
2883,BOOK IV.,come on.
2884,BOOK IV.,
2885,BOOK IV.,"But the wise Penelope lay there in her upper chamber, fasting and"
2886,BOOK IV.,"tasting neither meat nor drink, musing whether her noble son should"
2887,BOOK IV.,"escape death, or even fall before the proud wooers. And as a lion"
2888,BOOK IV.,"broods all in fear among the press of men, when they draw the crafty"
2889,BOOK IV.,"ring around him, so deeply was she musing when deep sleep came over"
2890,BOOK IV.,her. And she sank back in sleep and all her joints were loosened.
2891,BOOK IV.,
2892,BOOK IV.,"Now the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other thoughts. She made a"
2893,BOOK IV.,"phantom, and fashioned it after the likeness of a woman, Iphthime,"
2894,BOOK IV.,"daughter of great-hearted Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose dwelling"
2895,BOOK IV.,was in Pherae. And she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus to bid
2896,BOOK IV.,"Penelope, amid her sorrow and lamenting, to cease from her weeping and"
2897,BOOK IV.,tearful lamentation. So the phantom passed into the chamber by the
2898,BOOK IV.,"thong of the bolt, and stood above her head and spake unto her, saying:"
2899,BOOK IV.,
2900,BOOK IV.,"“Sleepest thou, Penelope, stricken at heart? Nay, even the gods who"
2901,BOOK IV.,"live at ease suffer thee not to wail or be afflicted, seeing that thy"
2902,BOOK IV.,son is yet to return; for no sinner is he in the eyes of the gods.”
2903,BOOK IV.,
2904,BOOK IV.,Then wise Penelope made her answer as she slumbered very softly at the
2905,BOOK IV.,gates of dreams:
2906,BOOK IV.,
2907,BOOK IV.,"“Wherefore, sister, hast thou come hither, that before wert not wont to"
2908,BOOK IV.,"come, for thou hast thine habitation very far away? Biddest thou me"
2909,BOOK IV.,"indeed to cease from the sorrows and pains, so many that disquiet my"
2910,BOOK IV.,"heart and soul? Erewhile I lost my noble lord of the lion heart,"
2911,BOOK IV.,"adorned with all perfection among the Danaans, my true lord, whose fame"
2912,BOOK IV.,"is noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos. And now, again, my"
2913,BOOK IV.,"well-beloved son is departed on his hollow ship, poor child, not"
2914,BOOK IV.,skilled in toils or in the gatherings of men. For him I sorrow yet more
2915,BOOK IV.,"than for my lord, and I tremble and fear for him lest aught befal him,"
2916,BOOK IV.,"whether, it may be, amid that folk where he is gone, or in the deep."
2917,BOOK IV.,"For many foemen devise evil against him, and go about to kill him, or"
2918,BOOK IV.,ever he come to his own country.”
2919,BOOK IV.,
2920,BOOK IV.,"And the dim phantom answered her, and said: “Take courage, and be not"
2921,BOOK IV.,"so sorely afraid. For lo, such a friend goes to guide him, as all men"
2922,BOOK IV.,"pray to stand by them, for that she hath the power, even Pallas Athene."
2923,BOOK IV.,"And she pitieth thee in thy sorrow, and now hath sent me forth to speak"
2924,BOOK IV.,these words to thee.”
2925,BOOK IV.,
2926,BOOK IV.,"And wise Penelope answered her, saying: “If thou art indeed a god, and"
2927,BOOK IV.,"hast heard the word of a god, come, I pray thee, and tell me tidings"
2928,BOOK IV.,"concerning that ill-fated man, whether perchance he is yet alive and"
2929,BOOK IV.,"sees the light of the sun, or hath already died, and is a dweller in"
2930,BOOK IV.,the house of Hades.”
2931,BOOK IV.,
2932,BOOK IV.,And the dim phantom answered her and said: “Concerning him I will not
2933,BOOK IV.,"tell thee all the tale, whether he be alive or dead; it is ill to speak"
2934,BOOK IV.,words light as wind.”
2935,BOOK IV.,
2936,BOOK IV.,Therewith the phantom slipped away by the bolt of the door and passed
2937,BOOK IV.,into the breath of the wind. And the daughter of Icarius started up
2938,BOOK IV.,"from sleep; and her heart was cheered, so clear was the vision that"
2939,BOOK IV.,sped toward her in the dead of the night.
2940,BOOK IV.,
2941,BOOK IV.,"Meanwhile the wooers had taken ship and were sailing over the wet ways,"
2942,BOOK IV.,pondering in their hearts sheer death for Telemachus. Now there is a
2943,BOOK IV.,"rocky isle in the mid sea, midway between Ithaca and rugged Samos,"
2944,BOOK IV.,"Asteris, a little isle; and there is a harbour therein with a double"
2945,BOOK IV.,"entrance, where ships may ride. There the Achaeans abode lying in wait"
2946,BOOK IV.,for Telemachus.
2947,BOOK IV.,
2948,BOOK IV.,
2949,BOOK IV.,
2950,BOOK V.,BOOK V.
2951,BOOK V.,
2952,BOOK V.,
2953,BOOK V.,The Gods in council command Calypso by Hermes to send away Odysseus on
2954,BOOK V.,"a raft of trees; and Poseidon, returning from Ethiopia and seeing him"
2955,BOOK V.,"on the coast of Phaeacia, scattered his raft; and how by the help of"
2956,BOOK V.,"Ino he was thrown ashore, and slept on a heap of dry leaves till the"
2957,BOOK V.,next day.
2958,BOOK V.,
2959,BOOK V.,
2960,BOOK V.,"Now the Dawn arose from her couch, from the side of the lordly"
2961,BOOK V.,"Tithonus, to bear light to the immortals and to mortal men. And lo, the"
2962,BOOK V.,"gods were gathering to session, and among them Zeus, that thunders on"
2963,BOOK V.,"high, whose might is above all. And Athene told them the tale of the"
2964,BOOK V.,"many woes of Odysseus, recalling them to mind; for near her heart was"
2965,BOOK V.,he that then abode in the dwelling of the nymph:
2966,BOOK V.,
2967,BOOK V.,"“Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for ever,"
2968,BOOK V.,henceforth let not any sceptred king be kind and gentle with all his
2969,BOOK V.,"heart, nor minded to do righteously, but let him alway be a hard man"
2970,BOOK V.,"and work unrighteousness, for behold, there is none that remembereth"
2971,BOOK V.,"divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was, and was gentle as a"
2972,BOOK V.,"father. Howbeit, as for him he lieth in an island suffering strong"
2973,BOOK V.,"pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who holdeth him perforce; so"
2974,BOOK V.,"he may not reach his own country, for he hath no ships by him with"
2975,BOOK V.,"oars, and no companions to send him on his way over the broad back of"
2976,BOOK V.,"the sea. And now, again, they are set on slaying his beloved son on his"
2977,BOOK V.,"homeward way, for he is gone to fair Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon, to"
2978,BOOK V.,seek tidings of his father.”
2979,BOOK V.,
2980,BOOK V.,"And Zeus, gatherer of the clouds, answered and spake unto her: “My"
2981,BOOK V.,"child, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips? Nay, didst thou not"
2982,BOOK V.,"thyself plan this device, that Odysseus may assuredly take vengeance on"
2983,BOOK V.,"those men at his coming? As for Telemachus, do thou guide him by thine"
2984,BOOK V.,"art, as well as thou mayest, that so he may come to his own country all"
2985,BOOK V.,"unharmed, and the wooers may return in their ship with their labour all"
2986,BOOK V.,in vain.”
2987,BOOK V.,
2988,BOOK V.,"Therewith he spake to Hermes, his dear son: “Hermes, forasmuch as even"
2989,BOOK V.,"in all else thou art our herald, tell unto the nymph of the braided"
2990,BOOK V.,"tresses my unerring counsel, even the return of the patient Odysseus,"
2991,BOOK V.,"how he is to come to his home, with no furtherance of gods or of mortal"
2992,BOOK V.,"men. Nay, he shall sail on a well-bound raft, in sore distress, and on"
2993,BOOK V.,"the twentieth day arrive at fertile Scheria, even at the land of the"
2994,BOOK V.,"Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods. And they shall give him"
2995,BOOK V.,"all worship heartily as to a god, and send him on his way in a ship to"
2996,BOOK V.,"his own dear country, with gifts of bronze and gold, and raiment in"
2997,BOOK V.,"plenty, much store, such as never would Odysseus have won for himself"
2998,BOOK V.,"out of Troy, yea, though he had returned unhurt with the share of the"
2999,BOOK V.,"spoil that fell to him. On such wise is he fated to see his friends,"
3000,BOOK V.,and come to his high-roofed home and his own country.”
3001,BOOK V.,
3002,BOOK V.,"So spake he, nor heedless was the messenger, the slayer of Argos."
3003,BOOK V.,"Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely golden sandals, that"
3004,BOOK V.,"wax not old, that bare him alike over the wet sea and over the"
3005,BOOK V.,"limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And he took the wand"
3006,BOOK V.,"wherewith he lulls the eyes of whomso he will, while others again he"
3007,BOOK V.,even wakes from out of sleep. With this rod in his hand flew the strong
3008,BOOK V.,slayer of Argos. Above Pieria he passed and leapt from the upper air
3009,BOOK V.,"into the deep. Then he sped along the wave like the cormorant, that"
3010,BOOK V.,"chaseth the fishes through the perilous gulfs of the unharvested sea,"
3011,BOOK V.,and wetteth his thick plumage in the brine. Such like did Hermes ride
3012,BOOK V.,upon the press of the waves. But when he had now reached that far-off
3013,BOOK V.,"isle, he went forth from the sea of violet blue to get him up into the"
3014,BOOK V.,"land, till he came to a great cave, wherein dwelt the nymph of the"
3015,BOOK V.,braided tresses: and he found her within. And on the hearth there was a
3016,BOOK V.,"great fire burning, and from afar through the isle was smelt the"
3017,BOOK V.,"fragrance of cleft cedar blazing, and of sandal wood. And the nymph"
3018,BOOK V.,within was singing with a sweet voice as she fared to and fro before
3019,BOOK V.,"the loom, and wove with a shuttle of gold. And round about the cave"
3020,BOOK V.,"there was a wood blossoming, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling"
3021,BOOK V.,"cypress. And therein roosted birds long of wing, owls and falcons and"
3022,BOOK V.,"chattering sea-crows, which have their business in the waters. And lo,"
3023,BOOK V.,"there about the hollow cave trailed a gadding garden vine, all rich"
3024,BOOK V.,with clusters. And fountains four set orderly were running with clear
3025,BOOK V.,"water, hard by one another, turned each to his own course. And all"
3026,BOOK V.,"around soft meadows bloomed of violets and parsley, yea, even a"
3027,BOOK V.,deathless god who came thither might wonder at the sight and be glad at
3028,BOOK V.,"heart. There the messenger, the slayer of Argos, stood and wondered."
3029,BOOK V.,"Now when he had gazed at all with wonder, anon he went into the wide"
3030,BOOK V.,"cave; nor did Calypso, that fair goddess, fail to know him, when she"
3031,BOOK V.,saw him face to face; for the gods use not to be strange one to
3032,BOOK V.,"another, the immortals, not though one have his habitation far away."
3033,BOOK V.,"But he found not Odysseus, the greathearted, within the cave, who sat"
3034,BOOK V.,"weeping on the shore even as aforetime, straining his soul with tears"
3035,BOOK V.,"and groans and griefs, and as he wept he looked wistfully over the"
3036,BOOK V.,"unharvested deep. And Calypso, that fair goddess, questioned Hermes,"
3037,BOOK V.,when she had made him sit on a bright shining seat:
3038,BOOK V.,
3039,BOOK V.,"“Wherefore, I pray thee, Hermes, of the golden wand, hast thou come"
3040,BOOK V.,"hither, worshipful and welcome, whereas as of old thou wert not wont to"
3041,BOOK V.,"visit me? Tell me all thy thought; my heart is set on fulfilling it, if"
3042,BOOK V.,"fulfil it I may, and if it hath been fulfilled in the counsel of fate."
3043,BOOK V.,"But now follow me further, that I may set before thee the entertainment"
3044,BOOK V.,of strangers.”
3045,BOOK V.,
3046,BOOK V.,"Therewith the goddess spread a table with ambrosia and set it by him,"
3047,BOOK V.,"and mixed the ruddy nectar. So the messenger, the slayer of Argos, did"
3048,BOOK V.,eat and drink. Now after he had supped and comforted his soul with
3049,BOOK V.,"food, at the last he answered, and spake to her on this wise:"
3050,BOOK V.,
3051,BOOK V.,"“Thou makest question of me on my coming, a goddess of a god, and I"
3052,BOOK V.,"will tell thee this my saying truly, at thy command. ’Twas Zeus that"
3053,BOOK V.,"bade me come hither, by no will of mine; nay, who of his free will"
3054,BOOK V.,"would speed over such a wondrous space of brine, whereby is no city of"
3055,BOOK V.,"mortals that do sacrifice to the gods, and offer choice hecatombs? But"
3056,BOOK V.,surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to
3057,BOOK V.,"make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis. He saith that thou"
3058,BOOK V.,"hast with thee a man most wretched beyond his fellows, beyond those men"
3059,BOOK V.,"that round the burg of Priam for nine years fought, and in the tenth"
3060,BOOK V.,year sacked the city and departed homeward. Yet on the way they sinned
3061,BOOK V.,"against Athene, and she raised upon them an evil blast and long waves"
3062,BOOK V.,"of the sea. Then all the rest of his good company was lost, but it came"
3063,BOOK V.,to pass that the wind bare and the wave brought him hither. And now
3064,BOOK V.,"Zeus biddeth thee send him hence with what speed thou mayest, for it is"
3065,BOOK V.,"not ordained that he die away from his friends, but rather it is his"
3066,BOOK V.,"fate to look on them even yet, and to come to his high-roofed home and"
3067,BOOK V.,his own country.”
3068,BOOK V.,
3069,BOOK V.,"So spake he, and Calypso, that fair goddess, shuddered and uttered her"
3070,BOOK V.,"voice, and spake unto him winged words: “Hard are ye gods and jealous"
3071,BOOK V.,"exceeding, who ever grudge goddesses openly to mate with men, if any"
3072,BOOK V.,make a mortal her dear bed-fellow. Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took
3073,BOOK V.,"Orion for her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous thereof,"
3074,BOOK V.,"till chaste Artemis, of the golden throne, slew him in Ortygia with the"
3075,BOOK V.,visitation of her gentle shafts. So too when fair-tressed Demeter
3076,BOOK V.,"yielded to her love, and lay with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed"
3077,BOOK V.,"fallow-field, Zeus was not long without tidings thereof, and cast at"
3078,BOOK V.,him with his white bolt and slew him. So again ye gods now grudge that
3079,BOOK V.,a mortal man should dwell with me. Him I saved as he went all alone
3080,BOOK V.,"bestriding the keel of a bark, for that Zeus had crushed[11] and cleft"
3081,BOOK V.,his swift ship with a white bolt in the midst of the wine-dark deep.
3082,BOOK V.,"There all the rest of his good company was lost, but it came to pass"
3083,BOOK V.,that the wind bare and the wave brought him hither. And him have I
3084,BOOK V.,"loved and cherished, and I said that I would make him to know not death"
3085,BOOK V.,and age for ever. Yet forasmuch as it is no wise possible for another
3086,BOOK V.,"god to go beyond, or make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis,"
3087,BOOK V.,"let him away over the unharvested seas, if the summons and the bidding"
3088,BOOK V.,"be of Zeus. But I will give him no despatch, not I, for I have no ships"
3089,BOOK V.,"by me with oars, nor company to bear him on his way over the broad back"
3090,BOOK V.,"of the sea. Yet will I be forward to put this in his mind, and will"
3091,BOOK V.,"hide nought, that all unharmed he may come to his own country.”"
3092,BOOK V.,
3093,BOOK V.,[11] It seems very doubtful whether ἔλσας can bear this meaning. The
3094,BOOK V.,"reading ἐλάσας, “smote,” preserved by the Schol. is highly probable."
3095,BOOK V.,
3096,BOOK V.,
3097,BOOK V.,"Then the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered her: “Yea, speed him"
3098,BOOK V.,"now upon his path and have regard unto the wrath of Zeus, lest haply he"
3099,BOOK V.,be angered and bear hard on thee hereafter.”
3100,BOOK V.,
3101,BOOK V.,"Therewith the great slayer of Argos departed, but the lady nymph went"
3102,BOOK V.,"on her way to the great-hearted Odysseus, when she had heard the"
3103,BOOK V.,"message of Zeus. And there she found him sitting on the shore, and his"
3104,BOOK V.,"eyes were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was ebbing away as he"
3105,BOOK V.,mourned for his return; for the nymph no more found favour in his
3106,BOOK V.,"sight. Howsoever by night he would sleep by her, as needs he must, in"
3107,BOOK V.,"the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady. And in the"
3108,BOOK V.,"day-time he would sit on the rocks and on the beach, straining his soul"
3109,BOOK V.,"with tears, and groans, and griefs, and through his tears he would look"
3110,BOOK V.,wistfully over the unharvested deep. So standing near him that fair
3111,BOOK V.,goddess spake to him:
3112,BOOK V.,
3113,BOOK V.,"“Hapless man, sorrow no more I pray thee in this isle, nor let thy good"
3114,BOOK V.,"life waste away, for even now will I send thee hence with all my heart."
3115,BOOK V.,"Nay, arise and cut long beams, and fashion a wide raft with the axe,"
3116,BOOK V.,"and lay deckings high thereupon, that it may bear thee over the misty"
3117,BOOK V.,"deep. And I will place therein bread and water, and red wine to thy"
3118,BOOK V.,"heart’s desire, to keep hunger far away. And I will put raiment upon"
3119,BOOK V.,"thee, and send a fair gale in thy wake, that so thou mayest come all"
3120,BOOK V.,"unharmed to thine own country, if indeed it be the good pleasure of the"
3121,BOOK V.,"gods who hold wide heaven, who are stronger than I am both to will and"
3122,BOOK V.,to do.”
3123,BOOK V.,
3124,BOOK V.,"So she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus shuddered, and uttering"
3125,BOOK V.,"his voice spake to her winged words: “Herein, goddess, thou hast"
3126,BOOK V.,"plainly some other thought, and in no wise my furtherance, for that"
3127,BOOK V.,thou biddest me to cross in a raft the great gulf of the sea so dread
3128,BOOK V.,"and difficult, which not even the swift gallant ships pass over"
3129,BOOK V.,rejoicing in the breeze of Zeus. Nor would I go aboard a raft to
3130,BOOK V.,"displeasure thee, unless thou wilt deign, O goddess, to swear a great"
3131,BOOK V.,oath not to plan any hidden guile to mine own hurt.”
3132,BOOK V.,
3133,BOOK V.,"So spake he, and Calypso, the fair goddess, smiled and caressed him"
3134,BOOK V.,"with her hand, and spake and hailed him:"
3135,BOOK V.,
3136,BOOK V.,"“Knavish thou art, and no weakling[12] in wit, thou that hast conceived"
3137,BOOK V.,"and spoken such a word. Let earth be now witness hereto, and the wide"
3138,BOOK V.,"heaven above, and that falling water of the Styx, the greatest oath and"
3139,BOOK V.,"the most terrible to the blessed gods, that I will not plan any hidden"
3140,BOOK V.,"guile to thine own hurt. Nay, but my thoughts are such, and such will"
3141,BOOK V.,"be my counsel, as I would devise for myself, if ever so sore a need"
3142,BOOK V.,"came over me. For I too have a righteous mind, and my heart within me"
3143,BOOK V.,"is not of iron, but pitiful even as thine.”"
3144,BOOK V.,
3145,BOOK V.,"[12] ἀποφώλιος, from root φυ, “ill-grown,” i. e. a weakling, in the"
3146,BOOK V.,"literal sense as B. xi.249, xiv.212, or metaphorical, as here and"
3147,BOOK V.,viii. 177.
3148,BOOK V.,
3149,BOOK V.,
3150,BOOK V.,"Therewith the fair goddess led the way quickly, and he followed hard in"
3151,BOOK V.,"the steps of the goddess. And they reached the hollow cave, the goddess"
3152,BOOK V.,and the man; so he sat him down upon the chair whence Hermes had
3153,BOOK V.,"arisen, and the nymph placed by him all manner of food to eat and"
3154,BOOK V.,"drink, such as is meat for men. As for her she sat over against divine"
3155,BOOK V.,"Odysseus, and the handmaids placed by her ambrosia and nectar. So they"
3156,BOOK V.,put forth their hands upon the good cheer set before them. But after
3157,BOOK V.,"they had taken their fill of meat and drink, Calypso, the fair goddess,"
3158,BOOK V.,spake first and said:
3159,BOOK V.,
3160,BOOK V.,"“Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, so it"
3161,BOOK V.,is indeed thy wish to get thee home to thine own dear country even in
3162,BOOK V.,this hour? Good fortune go with thee even so! Yet didst thou know in
3163,BOOK V.,"thine heart what a measure of suffering thou art ordained to fulfil, or"
3164,BOOK V.,"ever thou reach thine own country, here, even here, thou wouldst abide"
3165,BOOK V.,"with me and keep this house, and wouldst never taste of death, though"
3166,BOOK V.,"thou longest to see thy wife, for whom thou hast ever a desire day by"
3167,BOOK V.,day. Not in sooth that I avow me to be less noble than she in form or
3168,BOOK V.,"fashion, for it is in no wise meet that mortal women should match them"
3169,BOOK V.,"with immortals, in shape and comeliness.”"
3170,BOOK V.,
3171,BOOK V.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered, and spake unto her: “Be not"
3172,BOOK V.,"wroth with me hereat, goddess and queen. Myself I know it well, how"
3173,BOOK V.,"wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou, in comeliness and"
3174,BOOK V.,stature. But she is mortal and thou knowest not age nor death. Yet even
3175,BOOK V.,"so, I wish and long day by day to fare homeward and see the day of my"
3176,BOOK V.,"returning. Yea, and if some god shall wreck me in the wine-dark deep,"
3177,BOOK V.,"even so I will endure, with a heart within me patient of affliction."
3178,BOOK V.,"For already have I suffered full much, and much have I toiled in perils"
3179,BOOK V.,of waves and war; let this be added to the tale of those.”
3180,BOOK V.,
3181,BOOK V.,"So spake he, and the sun sank and darkness came on. Then they twain"
3182,BOOK V.,"went into the chamber of the hollow rock, and had their delight of"
3183,BOOK V.,"love, abiding each by other."
3184,BOOK V.,
3185,BOOK V.,"So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, anon Odysseus put"
3186,BOOK V.,"on him a mantle and doublet, and the nymph clad her in a great shining"
3187,BOOK V.,"robe, light of woof and gracious, and about her waist she cast a fair"
3188,BOOK V.,"golden girdle, and a veil withal upon her head. Then she considered of"
3189,BOOK V.,"the sending of Odysseus, the great-hearted. She gave him a great axe,"
3190,BOOK V.,"fitted to his grasp, an axe of bronze double-edged, and with a goodly"
3191,BOOK V.,"handle of olive wood fastened well. Next she gave him a polished adze,"
3192,BOOK V.,"and she led the way to the border of the isle where tall trees grew,"
3193,BOOK V.,"alder and poplar, and pine that reacheth unto heaven, seasoned long"
3194,BOOK V.,"since and sere, that might lightly float for him. Now after she had"
3195,BOOK V.,"shown him where the tall trees grew, Calypso, the fair goddess,"
3196,BOOK V.,"departed homeward. And he set to cutting timber, and his work went"
3197,BOOK V.,"busily. Twenty trees in all he felled, and then trimmed them with the"
3198,BOOK V.,"axe of bronze, and deftly smoothed them, and over them made straight"
3199,BOOK V.,"the line. Meanwhile Calypso, the fair goddess, brought him augers, so"
3200,BOOK V.,"he bored each piece and jointed them together, and then made all fast"
3201,BOOK V.,with trenails and dowels. Wide as is the floor of a broad ship of
3202,BOOK V.,"burden, which some man well skilled in carpentry may trace him out, of"
3203,BOOK V.,"such beam did Odysseus fashion his broad raft. And thereat he wrought,"
3204,BOOK V.,"and set up the deckings, fitting them to the close-set uprights, and"
3205,BOOK V.,"finished them off with long gunwales, and there he set a mast, and a"
3206,BOOK V.,"yard-arm fitted thereto, and moreover he made him a rudder to guide the"
3207,BOOK V.,"craft. And he fenced it with wattled osier withies from stem to stern,"
3208,BOOK V.,"to be a bulwark against the wave, and piled up wood to back them."
3209,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile Calypso, the fair goddess, brought him web of cloth to make"
3210,BOOK V.,him sails; and these too he fashioned very skilfully. And he made fast
3211,BOOK V.,"therein braces and halyards and sheets, and at last he pushed the raft"
3212,BOOK V.,with levers down to the fair salt sea.
3213,BOOK V.,
3214,BOOK V.,"It was the fourth day when he had accomplished all. And, lo, on the"
3215,BOOK V.,"fifth, the fair Calypso sent him on his way from the island, when she"
3216,BOOK V.,"had bathed him and clad him in fragrant attire. Moreover, the goddess"
3217,BOOK V.,"placed on board the ship two skins, one of dark wine, and another, a"
3218,BOOK V.,"great one, of water, and corn too in a wallet, and she set therein a"
3219,BOOK V.,"store of dainties to his heart’s desire, and sent forth a warm and"
3220,BOOK V.,gentle wind to blow. And goodly Odysseus rejoiced as he set his sails
3221,BOOK V.,"to the breeze. So he sate and cunningly guided the craft with the helm,"
3222,BOOK V.,"nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids, as he viewed the Pleiads and"
3223,BOOK V.,"Bootes, that setteth late, and the Bear, which they likewise call the"
3224,BOOK V.,"Wain, which turneth ever in one place, and keepeth watch upon Orion,"
3225,BOOK V.,"and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean. This star, Calypso, the"
3226,BOOK V.,"fair goddess, bade him to keep ever on the left as he traversed the"
3227,BOOK V.,"deep. Ten days and seven he sailed traversing the deep, and on the"
3228,BOOK V.,eighteenth day appeared the shadowy hills of the land of the
3229,BOOK V.,"Phaeacians, at the point where it lay nearest to him; and it showed"
3230,BOOK V.,like a shield in the misty deep.
3231,BOOK V.,
3232,BOOK V.,"Now the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the Ethiopians"
3233,BOOK V.,espied him afar off from the mountains of the Solymi: even thence he
3234,BOOK V.,saw Odysseus as he sailed over the deep; and he was mightily angered in
3235,BOOK V.,"spirit, and shaking his head he communed with his own heart. “Lo now,"
3236,BOOK V.,it must be that the gods at the last have changed their purpose
3237,BOOK V.,"concerning Odysseus, while I was away among the Ethiopians. And now he"
3238,BOOK V.,"is nigh to the Phaeacian land, where it is ordained that he escape the"
3239,BOOK V.,"great issues of the woe which hath come upon him. But, methinks, that"
3240,BOOK V.,even yet I will drive him far enough in the path of suffering.”
3241,BOOK V.,
3242,BOOK V.,"With that he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep,"
3243,BOOK V.,grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all
3244,BOOK V.,"manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped"
3245,BOOK V.,"night from heaven. The East Wind and the South Wind clashed, and the"
3246,BOOK V.,"stormy West, and the North, that is born in the bright air, rolling"
3247,BOOK V.,onward a great wave. Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and his
3248,BOOK V.,"heart melted, and heavily he spake to his own great spirit:"
3249,BOOK V.,
3250,BOOK V.,"“Oh, wretched man that I am! what is to befal me at the last? I fear"
3251,BOOK V.,"that indeed the goddess spake all things truly, who said that I should"
3252,BOOK V.,"fill up the measure of sorrow on the deep, or ever I came to mine own"
3253,BOOK V.,"country; and lo, all these things have an end. In such wise doth Zeus"
3254,BOOK V.,"crown the wide heaven with clouds, and hath troubled the deep, and the"
3255,BOOK V.,"blasts rush on of all the winds; yea, now is utter doom assured me."
3256,BOOK V.,"Thrice blessed those Danaans, yea, four times blessed, who perished on"
3257,BOOK V.,"a time in wide Troy-land, doing a pleasure to the sons of Atreus! Would"
3258,BOOK V.,"to God that I too had died, and met my fate on that day when the press"
3259,BOOK V.,"of Trojans cast their bronze-shod spears upon me, fighting for the body"
3260,BOOK V.,"of the son of Peleus! So should I have gotten my dues of burial, and"
3261,BOOK V.,the Achaeans would have spread my fame; but now it is my fate to be
3262,BOOK V.,overtaken by a pitiful death.”
3263,BOOK V.,
3264,BOOK V.,"Even as he spake, the great wave smote down upon him, driving on in"
3265,BOOK V.,"terrible wise, that the raft reeled again. And far therefrom he fell,"
3266,BOOK V.,and lost the helm from his hand; and the fierce blast of the jostling
3267,BOOK V.,"winds came and brake his mast in the midst, and sail and yard-arm fell"
3268,BOOK V.,"afar into the deep. Long time the water kept him under, nor could he"
3269,BOOK V.,speedily rise from beneath the rush of the mighty wave: for the
3270,BOOK V.,garments hung heavy which fair Calypso gave him. But late and at length
3271,BOOK V.,"he came up, and spat forth from his mouth the bitter salt water, which"
3272,BOOK V.,"ran down in streams from his head. Yet even so forgat he not his raft,"
3273,BOOK V.,"for all his wretched plight, but made a spring after it in the waves,"
3274,BOOK V.,"and clutched it to him, and sat in the midst thereof, avoiding the"
3275,BOOK V.,issues of death; and the great wave swept it hither and thither along
3276,BOOK V.,the stream. And as the North Wind in the harvest tide sweeps the
3277,BOOK V.,"thistle-down along the plain, and close the tufts cling each to other,"
3278,BOOK V.,even so the winds bare the raft hither and thither along the main. Now
3279,BOOK V.,"the South would toss it to the North to carry, and now again the East"
3280,BOOK V.,would yield it to the West to chase.
3281,BOOK V.,
3282,BOOK V.,"But the daughter of Cadmus marked him, Ino of the fair ankles,"
3283,BOOK V.,"Leucothea, who in time past was a maiden of mortal speech, but now in"
3284,BOOK V.,the depths of the salt sea she had gotten her share of worship from the
3285,BOOK V.,"gods. She took pity on Odysseus in his wandering and travail, and she"
3286,BOOK V.,"rose, like a sea-gull on the wing, from the depth of the mere, and sat"
3287,BOOK V.,upon the well-bound raft and spake saying:
3288,BOOK V.,
3289,BOOK V.,"“Hapless one, wherefore was Poseidon, shaker of the earth, so wondrous"
3290,BOOK V.,"wroth with thee, seeing that he soweth for thee the seeds of many"
3291,BOOK V.,"evils? Yet shall he not make a full end of thee, for all his desire."
3292,BOOK V.,"But do even as I tell thee, and methinks thou art not witless. Cast off"
3293,BOOK V.,"these garments, and leave the raft to drift before the winds, but do"
3294,BOOK V.,thou swim with thine hands and strive to win a footing on the coast[13]
3295,BOOK V.,"of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that thou escape. Here, take"
3296,BOOK V.,this veil imperishable and wind it about thy breast; so is there no
3297,BOOK V.,fear that thou suffer aught or perish. But when thou hast laid hold of
3298,BOOK V.,"the mainland with thy hands, loose it from off thee and cast it into"
3299,BOOK V.,"the wine-dark deep far from the land, and thyself turn away.”"
3300,BOOK V.,
3301,BOOK V.,"[13] Lit. Strive after an arrival on the land, etc. νόστος originally"
3302,BOOK V.,"meant _going, journeying_, and had no idea of _return_. The earlier"
3303,BOOK V.,"use survives here, and in Soph. Philoct. 43, Eur. Iph. Aul. 1261."
3304,BOOK V.,"Similarly, perhaps, νοστεῖν in Odyssey iv. 619, xv. 119, and νέεσθαι"
3305,BOOK V.,frequently.
3306,BOOK V.,
3307,BOOK V.,
3308,BOOK V.,"With that the goddess gave the veil, and for her part dived back into"
3309,BOOK V.,"the heaving deep, like a sea-gull: and the dark wave closed over her."
3310,BOOK V.,"But the steadfast goodly Odysseus pondered, and heavily he spake to his"
3311,BOOK V.,own brave spirit:
3312,BOOK V.,
3313,BOOK V.,"“Ah, woe is me! Can it be that some one of the immortals is weaving a"
3314,BOOK V.,"new snare for me, that she bids me quit my raft? Nay verily, I will not"
3315,BOOK V.,"yet obey, for I had sight of the shore yet a long way off, where she"
3316,BOOK V.,told me that I might escape. I am resolved what I will do;—and methinks
3317,BOOK V.,"on this wise it is best. So long as the timbers abide in the dowels, so"
3318,BOOK V.,"long will I endure steadfast in affliction, but so soon as the wave"
3319,BOOK V.,"hath shattered my raft asunder, I will swim, for meanwhile no better"
3320,BOOK V.,counsel may be.”
3321,BOOK V.,
3322,BOOK V.,"While yet he pondered these things in his heart and soul, Poseidon,"
3323,BOOK V.,"shaker of the earth, stirred against him a great wave, terrible and"
3324,BOOK V.,"grievous, and vaulted from the crest, and therewith smote him. And as"
3325,BOOK V.,"when a great tempestuous wind tosseth a heap of parched husks, and"
3326,BOOK V.,"scatters them this way and that, even so did the wave scatter the long"
3327,BOOK V.,"beams of the raft. But Odysseus bestrode a single beam, as one rideth"
3328,BOOK V.,"on a courser, and stript him of the garments which fair Calypso gave"
3329,BOOK V.,"him. And presently he wound the veil beneath his breast, and fell prone"
3330,BOOK V.,"into the sea, outstretching his hands as one eager to swim. And the"
3331,BOOK V.,"lord, the shaker of the earth, saw him and shook his head, and communed"
3332,BOOK V.,"with his own soul. “Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering"
3333,BOOK V.,"over the deep, till thou shalt come among a people, the fosterlings of"
3334,BOOK V.,Zeus. Yet for all that I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too
3335,BOOK V.,lightly afflicted.” Therewith he lashed his steeds of the flowing
3336,BOOK V.,"manes, and came to Aegae, where is his lordly home."
3337,BOOK V.,
3338,BOOK V.,"But Athene, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts. Behold, she bound"
3339,BOOK V.,"up the courses of the other winds, and charged them all to cease and be"
3340,BOOK V.,"still; but she roused the swift North and brake the waves before him,"
3341,BOOK V.,"that so Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, might mingle with the"
3342,BOOK V.,"Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, avoiding death and the fates."
3343,BOOK V.,
3344,BOOK V.,So for two nights and two days he was wandering in the swell of the
3345,BOOK V.,"sea, and much his heart boded of death. But when at last the"
3346,BOOK V.,"fair-tressed Dawn brought the full light of the third day, thereafter"
3347,BOOK V.,"the breeze fell, and lo, there was a breathless calm, and with a quick"
3348,BOOK V.,"glance ahead, (he being upborne on a great wave,) he saw the land very"
3349,BOOK V.,near. And even as when most welcome to his children is the sight of a
3350,BOOK V.,"father’s life, who lies in sickness and strong pains long wasting away,"
3351,BOOK V.,some angry god assailing him; and to their delight the gods have loosed
3352,BOOK V.,him from his trouble; so welcome to Odysseus showed land and wood; and
3353,BOOK V.,he swam onward being eager to set foot on the strand. But when he was
3354,BOOK V.,"within earshot of the shore, and heard now the thunder of the sea"
3355,BOOK V.,against the reefs—for the great wave crashed against the dry land
3356,BOOK V.,"belching in terrible wise, and all was covered with foam of the"
3357,BOOK V.,"sea,—for there were no harbours for ships nor shelters, but jutting"
3358,BOOK V.,headlands and reefs and cliffs; then at last the knees of Odysseus were
3359,BOOK V.,"loosened and his heart melted, and in heaviness he spake to his own"
3360,BOOK V.,brave spirit:
3361,BOOK V.,
3362,BOOK V.,"“Ah me! now that beyond all hope Zeus hath given me sight of land, and"
3363,BOOK V.,"withal I have cloven my way through this gulf of the sea, here there is"
3364,BOOK V.,no place to land on from out of the grey water. For without are sharp
3365,BOOK V.,"crags, and round them the wave roars surging, and sheer the smooth rock"
3366,BOOK V.,"rises, and the sea is deep thereby, so that in no wise may I find firm"
3367,BOOK V.,"foothold and escape my bane, for as I fain would go ashore, the great"
3368,BOOK V.,wave may haply snatch and dash me on the jagged rock—and a wretched
3369,BOOK V.,endeavour that would be. But if I swim yet further along the coast to
3370,BOOK V.,"find, if I may, spits that take the waves aslant and havens of the sea,"
3371,BOOK V.,I fear lest the storm-winds catch me again and bear me over the teeming
3372,BOOK V.,"deep, making heavy moan; or else some god may even send forth against"
3373,BOOK V.,me a monster from out of the shore water; and many such pastureth the
3374,BOOK V.,renowned Amphitrite. For I know how wroth against me hath been the
3375,BOOK V.,great Shaker of the Earth.”
3376,BOOK V.,
3377,BOOK V.,"Whilst yet he pondered these things in his heart and mind, a great wave"
3378,BOOK V.,bore him to the rugged shore. There would he have been stript of his
3379,BOOK V.,"skin and all his bones been broken, but that the goddess, grey-eyed"
3380,BOOK V.,"Athene, put a thought into his heart. He rushed in, and with both his"
3381,BOOK V.,"hands clutched the rock, whereto he clung till the great wave went by."
3382,BOOK V.,"So he escaped that peril, but again with backward wash it leapt on him"
3383,BOOK V.,and smote him and cast him forth into the deep. And as when the
3384,BOOK V.,"cuttlefish is dragged forth from his chamber, the many pebbles clinging"
3385,BOOK V.,"to his suckers, even so was the skin stript from his strong hand"
3386,BOOK V.,"against the rocks, and the great wave closed over him. There of a truth"
3387,BOOK V.,"would luckless Odysseus have perished beyond that which was ordained,"
3388,BOOK V.,had not grey-eyed Athene given him sure counsel. He rose from the line
3389,BOOK V.,"of the breakers that belch upon the shore, and swam outside, ever"
3390,BOOK V.,"looking landwards, to find, if he might, spits that take the waves"
3391,BOOK V.,"aslant, and havens of the sea. But when he came in his swimming over"
3392,BOOK V.,"against the mouth of a fair-flowing river, whereby the place seemed"
3393,BOOK V.,"best in his eyes, smooth of rocks, and withal there was a covert from"
3394,BOOK V.,"the wind, Odysseus felt the river running, and prayed to him in his"
3395,BOOK V.,heart:
3396,BOOK V.,
3397,BOOK V.,"“Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art; unto thee am I come, as to one to"
3398,BOOK V.,"whom prayer is made, while I flee the rebukes of Poseidon from the"
3399,BOOK V.,"deep. Yea, reverend even to the deathless gods is that man who comes as"
3400,BOOK V.,"a wanderer, even as I now have come to thy stream and to thy knees"
3401,BOOK V.,"after much travail. Nay pity me, O king; for I avow myself thy"
3402,BOOK V.,suppliant.”
3403,BOOK V.,
3404,BOOK V.,"So spake he, and the god straightway stayed his stream and withheld his"
3405,BOOK V.,"waves, and made the water smooth before him, and brought him safely to"
3406,BOOK V.,"the mouths of the river. And his knees bowed and his stout hands fell,"
3407,BOOK V.,for his heart was broken by the brine. And his flesh was all swollen
3408,BOOK V.,and a great stream of sea water gushed up through his mouth and
3409,BOOK V.,"nostrils. So he lay without breath or speech, swooning, such terrible"
3410,BOOK V.,weariness came upon him. But when now his breath returned and his
3411,BOOK V.,"spirit came to him again, he loosed from off him the veil of the"
3412,BOOK V.,"goddess, and let it fall into the salt flowing river. And the great"
3413,BOOK V.,"wave bare it back down the stream, and lightly Ino caught it in her"
3414,BOOK V.,"hands. Then Odysseus turned from the river, and fell back in the reeds,"
3415,BOOK V.,"and kissed earth, the grain-giver, and heavily he spake unto his own"
3416,BOOK V.,brave spirit:
3417,BOOK V.,
3418,BOOK V.,"“Ah, woe is me! What is to betide me? What shall happen unto me at the"
3419,BOOK V.,"last? If I watch the river bed all through the careful night, I fear"
3420,BOOK V.,"that the bitter frost and fresh dew may overcome me, as I breathe forth"
3421,BOOK V.,"my life for faintness, for the river breeze blows cold betimes in the"
3422,BOOK V.,"morning. But if I climb the hill-side up to the shady wood, and there"
3423,BOOK V.,"take rest in the thickets, though perchance the cold and weariness"
3424,BOOK V.,"leave hold of me, and sweet sleep may come over me, I fear lest of wild"
3425,BOOK V.,beasts I become the spoil and prey.”
3426,BOOK V.,
3427,BOOK V.,So as he thought thereon this seemed to him the better way. He went up
3428,BOOK V.,"to the wood, and found it nigh the water in a place of wide prospect."
3429,BOOK V.,"So he crept beneath twin bushes that grew from one stem, both olive"
3430,BOOK V.,"trees, one of them wild olive. Through these the force of the wet winds"
3431,BOOK V.,"blew never, neither did the bright sun light on it with his rays, nor"
3432,BOOK V.,"could the rain pierce through, so close were they twined either to"
3433,BOOK V.,other; and thereunder crept Odysseus and anon he heaped together with
3434,BOOK V.,"his hands a broad couch; for of fallen leaves there was great plenty,"
3435,BOOK V.,"enough to cover two or three men in winter time, however hard the"
3436,BOOK V.,"weather. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus beheld it and rejoiced, and"
3437,BOOK V.,he laid him in the midst thereof and flung over him the fallen leaves.
3438,BOOK V.,And as when a man hath hidden away a brand in the black embers at an
3439,BOOK V.,"upland farm, one that hath no neighbours nigh, and so saveth the seed"
3440,BOOK V.,"of fire, that he may not have to seek a light otherwhere, even so did"
3441,BOOK V.,Odysseus cover him with the leaves. And Athene shed sleep upon his
3442,BOOK V.,"eyes, that so it might soon release him from his weary travail,"
3443,BOOK V.,overshadowing his eyelids.
3444,BOOK V.,
3445,BOOK V.,
3446,BOOK V.,
3447,BOOK VI.,BOOK VI.
3448,BOOK VI.,
3449,BOOK VI.,
3450,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa, going to a river near that place to wash the clothes of her"
3451,BOOK VI.,"father, mother, and brethren, while the clothes were drying played with"
3452,BOOK VI.,"her maids at ball; and Odysseus coming forth is fed and clothed, and"
3453,BOOK VI.,"led on his way to the house of her father, King Alcinous."
3454,BOOK VI.,
3455,BOOK VI.,
3456,BOOK VI.,"So there he lay asleep, the steadfast goodly Odysseus, fordone with"
3457,BOOK VI.,toil and drowsiness. Meanwhile Athene went to the land and the city of
3458,BOOK VI.,"the Phaeacians, who of old, upon a time, dwelt in spacious Hypereia;"
3459,BOOK VI.,"near the Cyclôpes they dwelt, men exceeding proud, who harried them"
3460,BOOK VI.,"continually, being mightier than they. Thence the godlike Nausithous"
3461,BOOK VI.,"made them depart, and he carried them away, and planted them in"
3462,BOOK VI.,"Scheria, far off from men that live by bread. And he drew a wall around"
3463,BOOK VI.,"the town, and builded houses and made temples for the gods and meted"
3464,BOOK VI.,"out the fields. Howbeit ere this had he been stricken by fate, and had"
3465,BOOK VI.,"gone down to the house of Hades, and now Alcinous was reigning, with"
3466,BOOK VI.,"wisdom granted by the gods. To his house went the goddess, grey-eyed"
3467,BOOK VI.,"Athene, devising a return for the great-hearted Odysseus. She betook"
3468,BOOK VI.,"her to the rich-wrought bower, wherein was sleeping a maiden like to"
3469,BOOK VI.,"the gods in form and comeliness, Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous,"
3470,BOOK VI.,high of heart. Beside her on either hand of the pillars of the door
3471,BOOK VI.,"were two handmaids, dowered with beauty from the Graces, and the"
3472,BOOK VI.,shining doors were shut.
3473,BOOK VI.,
3474,BOOK VI.,"But the goddess, fleet as the breath of the wind, swept towards the"
3475,BOOK VI.,"couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and spake to her in the"
3476,BOOK VI.,"semblance of the daughter of a famous seafarer, Dymas, a girl of like"
3477,BOOK VI.,"age with Nausicaa, who had found grace in her sight. In her shape the"
3478,BOOK VI.,"grey-eyed Athene spake to the princess, saying:"
3479,BOOK VI.,
3480,BOOK VI.,"“Nausicaa, how hath thy mother so heedless a maiden to her daughter?"
3481,BOOK VI.,"Lo, thou hast shining raiment that lies by thee uncared for, and thy"
3482,BOOK VI.,"marriage day is near at hand, when thou thyself must needs go"
3483,BOOK VI.,"beautifully clad, and have garments to give to them who shall lead thee"
3484,BOOK VI.,"to the house of the bridegroom! And, behold, these are the things"
3485,BOOK VI.,"whence a good report goes abroad among men, wherein a father and lady"
3486,BOOK VI.,"mother take delight. But come, let us arise and go a-washing with the"
3487,BOOK VI.,"breaking of the day, and I will follow with thee to be thy mate in the"
3488,BOOK VI.,"toil, that without delay thou mayst get thee ready, since truly thou"
3489,BOOK VI.,"art not long to be a maiden. Lo, already they are wooing thee, the"
3490,BOOK VI.,"noblest youths of all the Phaeacians, among that people whence thou"
3491,BOOK VI.,"thyself dost draw thy lineage. So come, beseech thy noble father"
3492,BOOK VI.,betimes in the morning to furnish thee with mules and a wain to carry
3493,BOOK VI.,"the men’s raiment, and the robes, and the shining coverlets. Yea and"
3494,BOOK VI.,"for thyself it is seemlier far to go thus than on foot, for the places"
3495,BOOK VI.,where we must wash are a great way off the town.”
3496,BOOK VI.,
3497,BOOK VI.,"So spake the grey-eyed Athene, and departed to Olympus, where, as they"
3498,BOOK VI.,"say, is the seat of the gods that standeth fast for ever. Not by winds"
3499,BOOK VI.,"is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh"
3500,BOOK VI.,"thereto, but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and the white"
3501,BOOK VI.,light floats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all their
3502,BOOK VI.,"days, and thither Athene went when she had shown forth all to the"
3503,BOOK VI.,maiden.
3504,BOOK VI.,
3505,BOOK VI.,"Anon came the throned Dawn, and awakened Nausicaa of the fair robes,"
3506,BOOK VI.,"who straightway marvelled on the dream, and went through the halls to"
3507,BOOK VI.,"tell her parents, her father dear and her mother. And she found them"
3508,BOOK VI.,"within, her mother sitting by the hearth with the women her handmaids,"
3509,BOOK VI.,"spinning yarn of sea-purple stain, but her father she met as he was"
3510,BOOK VI.,"going forth to the renowned kings in their council, whither the noble"
3511,BOOK VI.,"Phaeacians called him. Standing close by her dear father she spake,"
3512,BOOK VI.,"saying: “Father, dear, couldst thou not lend me a high waggon with"
3513,BOOK VI.,"strong wheels, that I may take the goodly raiment to the river to wash,"
3514,BOOK VI.,"so much as I have lying soiled? Yea and it is seemly that thou thyself,"
3515,BOOK VI.,"when thou art with the princes in council, shouldest have fresh raiment"
3516,BOOK VI.,"to wear. Also, there are five dear sons of thine in the halls, two"
3517,BOOK VI.,"married, but three are lusty bachelors, and these are always eager for"
3518,BOOK VI.,new-washen garments wherein to go to the dances; for all these things
3519,BOOK VI.,have I taken thought.”
3520,BOOK VI.,
3521,BOOK VI.,"This she said, because she was ashamed to speak of glad marriage to her"
3522,BOOK VI.,"father; but he saw all and answered, saying:"
3523,BOOK VI.,
3524,BOOK VI.,"“Neither the mules nor aught else do I grudge thee, my child. Go thy"
3525,BOOK VI.,"ways, and the thralls shall get thee ready a high waggon with good"
3526,BOOK VI.,"wheels, and fitted with an upper frame.”"
3527,BOOK VI.,
3528,BOOK VI.,"Therewith he called to his men, and they gave ear, and without the"
3529,BOOK VI.,"palace they made ready the smooth-running mule-wain, and led the mules"
3530,BOOK VI.,"beneath the yoke, and harnessed them under the car, while the maiden"
3531,BOOK VI.,brought forth from her bower the shining raiment. This she stored in
3532,BOOK VI.,"the polished car, and her mother filled a basket with all manner of"
3533,BOOK VI.,"food to the heart’s desire, dainties too she set therein, and she"
3534,BOOK VI.,"poured wine into a goat-skin bottle, while Nausicaa climbed into the"
3535,BOOK VI.,"wain. And her mother gave her soft olive oil also in a golden cruse,"
3536,BOOK VI.,that she and her maidens might anoint themselves after the bath. Then
3537,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa took the whip and the shining reins, and touched the mules to"
3538,BOOK VI.,"start them; then there was a clatter of hoofs, and on they strained"
3539,BOOK VI.,"without flagging, with their load of the raiment and the maiden. Not"
3540,BOOK VI.,"alone did she go, for her attendants followed with her."
3541,BOOK VI.,
3542,BOOK VI.,"Now when they were come to the beautiful stream of the river, where"
3543,BOOK VI.,"truly were the unfailing cisterns, and bright water welled up free from"
3544,BOOK VI.,"beneath, and flowed past, enough to wash the foulest garments clean,"
3545,BOOK VI.,"there the girls unharnessed the mules from under the chariot, and"
3546,BOOK VI.,turning them loose they drove them along the banks of the eddying river
3547,BOOK VI.,to graze on the honey-sweet clover. Then they took the garments from
3548,BOOK VI.,"the wain, in their hands, and bore them to the black water, and briskly"
3549,BOOK VI.,"trod them down in the trenches, in busy rivalry. Now when they had"
3550,BOOK VI.,"washed and cleansed all the stains, they spread all out in order along"
3551,BOOK VI.,"the shore of the deep, even where the sea, in beating on the coast,"
3552,BOOK VI.,washed the pebbles clean. Then having bathed and anointed them well
3553,BOOK VI.,"with olive oil, they took their mid-day meal on the river’s banks,"
3554,BOOK VI.,"waiting till the clothes should dry in the brightness of the sun. Anon,"
3555,BOOK VI.,"when they were satisfied with food, the maidens and the princess, they"
3556,BOOK VI.,"fell to playing at ball, casting away their tires, and among them"
3557,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa of the white arms began the song. And even as Artemis, the"
3558,BOOK VI.,"archer, moveth down the mountain, either along the ridges of lofty"
3559,BOOK VI.,"Taygetus or Erymanthus, taking her pastime in the chase of boars and"
3560,BOOK VI.,"swift deer, and with her the wild wood-nymphs disport them, the"
3561,BOOK VI.,"daughters of Zeus, lord of the aegis, and Leto is glad at heart, while"
3562,BOOK VI.,"high over all she rears her head and brows, and easily may she be"
3563,BOOK VI.,"known,—but all are fair; even so the girl unwed outshone her maiden"
3564,BOOK VI.,company.
3565,BOOK VI.,
3566,BOOK VI.,"But when now she was about going homewards, after yoking the mules and"
3567,BOOK VI.,"folding up the goodly raiment, then grey-eyed Athene turned to other"
3568,BOOK VI.,"thoughts, that so Odysseus might awake, and see the lovely maiden, who"
3569,BOOK VI.,should be his guide to the city of the Phaeacian men. So then the
3570,BOOK VI.,"princess threw the ball at one of her company; she missed the girl, and"
3571,BOOK VI.,"cast the ball into the deep eddying current, whereat they all raised a"
3572,BOOK VI.,"piercing cry. Then the goodly Odysseus awoke and sat up, pondering in"
3573,BOOK VI.,his heart and spirit:
3574,BOOK VI.,
3575,BOOK VI.,"“Woe is me! to what men’s land am I come now? say, are they froward,"
3576,BOOK VI.,"and wild, and unjust, or are they hospitable, and of God-fearing mind?"
3577,BOOK VI.,"How shrill a cry of maidens rings round me, of the nymphs that hold the"
3578,BOOK VI.,"steep hill-tops, and the river-springs, and the grassy water meadows!"
3579,BOOK VI.,"It must be, methinks, that I am near men of human speech. Go to, I"
3580,BOOK VI.,myself will make trial and see.”
3581,BOOK VI.,
3582,BOOK VI.,"Therewith the goodly Odysseus crept out from under the coppice, having"
3583,BOOK VI.,"broken with his strong hand a leafy bough from the thick wood, to hold"
3584,BOOK VI.,"athwart his body, that it might hide his nakedness withal. And forth he"
3585,BOOK VI.,"sallied like a lion mountain-bred, trusting in his strength, who fares"
3586,BOOK VI.,"out blown and rained upon, with flaming eyes; amid the kine he goes or"
3587,BOOK VI.,"amid the sheep or in the track of the wild deer; yea, his belly bids"
3588,BOOK VI.,him go even to the good homestead to make assay upon the flocks. Even
3589,BOOK VI.,"so Odysseus was fain to draw nigh to the fair-tressed maidens, all"
3590,BOOK VI.,"naked as he was, such need had come upon him. But he was terrible in"
3591,BOOK VI.,"their eyes, being marred with the salt sea foam, and they fled cowering"
3592,BOOK VI.,here and there about the jutting spits of shore. And the daughter of
3593,BOOK VI.,"Alcinous alone stood firm, for Athene gave her courage of heart, and"
3594,BOOK VI.,took all trembling from her limbs. So she halted and stood over against
3595,BOOK VI.,"him, and Odysseus considered whether he should clasp the knees of the"
3596,BOOK VI.,"lovely maiden, and so make his prayer, or should stand as he was,"
3597,BOOK VI.,"apart, and beseech her with smooth words, if haply she might show him"
3598,BOOK VI.,"the town, and give him raiment. And as he thought within himself, it"
3599,BOOK VI.,"seemed better to stand apart, and beseech her with smooth words, lest"
3600,BOOK VI.,the maiden should be angered with him if he touched her knees: so
3601,BOOK VI.,straightway he spake a sweet and cunning word:
3602,BOOK VI.,
3603,BOOK VI.,"“I supplicate thee, O queen, whether thou art a goddess or a mortal! If"
3604,BOOK VI.,indeed thou art a goddess of them that keep the wide heaven; to
3605,BOOK VI.,"Artemis, then, the daughter of great Zeus, I mainly liken thee, for"
3606,BOOK VI.,beauty and stature and shapeliness. But if thou art one of the
3607,BOOK VI.,"daughters of men who dwell on earth, thrice blessed are thy father and"
3608,BOOK VI.,"thy lady mother, and thrice blessed thy brethren. Surely their souls"
3609,BOOK VI.,"ever glow with gladness for thy sake, each time they see thee entering"
3610,BOOK VI.,"the dance, so fair a flower of maidens. But he is of heart the most"
3611,BOOK VI.,"blessed beyond all other who shall prevail with gifts of wooing, and"
3612,BOOK VI.,lead thee to his home. Never have mine eyes beheld such an one among
3613,BOOK VI.,"mortals, neither man nor woman; great awe comes upon me as I look on"
3614,BOOK VI.,thee. Yet in Delos once I saw as goodly a thing: a young sapling of a
3615,BOOK VI.,"palm tree springing by the altar of Apollo. For thither too I went, and"
3616,BOOK VI.,"much people with me, on that path where my sore troubles were to be."
3617,BOOK VI.,"Yea, and when I looked thereupon, long time I marvelled in spirit,—for"
3618,BOOK VI.,"never grew there yet so goodly a shoot from ground,—even in such wise"
3619,BOOK VI.,"as I wonder at thee, lady, and am astonied and do greatly fear to touch"
3620,BOOK VI.,"thy knees, though grievous sorrow is upon me. Yesterday, on the"
3621,BOOK VI.,"twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark deep, but all that time"
3622,BOOK VI.,"continually the wave bare me, and the vehement winds drave, from the"
3623,BOOK VI.,"isle Ogygia. And now some god has cast me on this shore, that here too,"
3624,BOOK VI.,"methinks, some evil may betide me; for I trow not that trouble will"
3625,BOOK VI.,"cease; the gods ere that time will yet bring many a thing to pass. But,"
3626,BOOK VI.,"queen, have pity on me, for after many trials and sore to thee first of"
3627,BOOK VI.,"all am I come, and of the other folk, who hold this city and land, I"
3628,BOOK VI.,"know no man. Nay show me the town, give me an old garment to cast about"
3629,BOOK VI.,"me, if thou hadst, when thou camest here, any wrap for the linen. And"
3630,BOOK VI.,"may the gods grant thee all thy heart’s desire: a husband and a home,"
3631,BOOK VI.,"and a mind at one with his may they give—a good gift, for there is"
3632,BOOK VI.,nothing mightier and nobler than when man and wife are of one heart and
3633,BOOK VI.,"mind in a house, a grief to their foes, and to their friends great joy,"
3634,BOOK VI.,but their own hearts know it best.”
3635,BOOK VI.,
3636,BOOK VI.,"Then Nausicaa of the white arms answered him, and said: “Stranger,"
3637,BOOK VI.,forasmuch as thou seemest no evil man nor foolish—and it is Olympian
3638,BOOK VI.,"Zeus himself that giveth weal to men, to the good and to the evil, to"
3639,BOOK VI.,"each one as he will, and this thy lot doubtless is of him, and so thou"
3640,BOOK VI.,"must in anywise endure it:—and now, since thou hast come to our city"
3641,BOOK VI.,"and our land, thou shalt not lack raiment, nor aught else that is the"
3642,BOOK VI.,"due of a hapless suppliant, when he has met them who can befriend him."
3643,BOOK VI.,"And I will show thee the town, and name the name of the people. The"
3644,BOOK VI.,"Phaeacians hold this city and land, and I am the daughter of Alcinous,"
3645,BOOK VI.,"great of heart, on whom all the might and force of the Phaeacians"
3646,BOOK VI.,depend.”
3647,BOOK VI.,
3648,BOOK VI.,"Thus she spake, and called to her maidens of the fair tresses: “Halt,"
3649,BOOK VI.,"my maidens, whither flee ye at the sight of a man? Ye surely do not"
3650,BOOK VI.,"take him for an enemy? That mortal breathes not, and never will be"
3651,BOOK VI.,"born, who shall come with war to the land of the Phaeacians, for they"
3652,BOOK VI.,"are very dear to the gods. Far apart we live in the wash of the waves,"
3653,BOOK VI.,"the outermost of men, and no other mortals are conversant with us. Nay,"
3654,BOOK VI.,"but this man is some helpless one come hither in his wanderings, whom"
3655,BOOK VI.,"now we must kindly entreat, for all strangers and beggars are from"
3656,BOOK VI.,"Zeus, and a little gift is dear. So, my maidens, give the stranger meat"
3657,BOOK VI.,"and drink, and bathe him in the river, where withal is a shelter from"
3658,BOOK VI.,the winds.”
3659,BOOK VI.,
3660,BOOK VI.,"So she spake, but they had halted and called each to the other, and"
3661,BOOK VI.,"they brought Odysseus to the sheltered place, and made him sit down, as"
3662,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa bade them, the daughter of Alcinous, high of heart. Beside him"
3663,BOOK VI.,"they laid a mantle, and a doublet for raiment, and gave him soft olive"
3664,BOOK VI.,"oil in the golden cruse, and bade him wash in the streams of the river."
3665,BOOK VI.,"Then goodly Odysseus spake among the maidens, saying: “I pray you stand"
3666,BOOK VI.,"thus apart, while I myself wash the brine from my shoulders, and anoint"
3667,BOOK VI.,"me with olive oil, for truly oil is long a stranger to my skin. But in"
3668,BOOK VI.,"your sight I will not bathe, for I am ashamed to make me naked in the"
3669,BOOK VI.,company of fair-tressed maidens.”
3670,BOOK VI.,
3671,BOOK VI.,Then they went apart and told all to their lady. But with the river
3672,BOOK VI.,water the goodly Odysseus washed from his skin the salt scurf that
3673,BOOK VI.,"covered his back and broad shoulders, and from his head he wiped the"
3674,BOOK VI.,"crusted brine of the barren sea. But when he had washed his whole body,"
3675,BOOK VI.,"and anointed him with olive oil, and had clad himself in the raiment"
3676,BOOK VI.,"that the unwedded maiden gave him, then Athene, the daughter of Zeus,"
3677,BOOK VI.,"made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused"
3678,BOOK VI.,"deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some"
3679,BOOK VI.,skilful man overlays gold upon silver—one that Hephaestus and Pallas
3680,BOOK VI.,"Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his"
3681,BOOK VI.,handiwork—even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders.
3682,BOOK VI.,
3683,BOOK VI.,"Then to the shore of the sea went Odysseus apart, and sat down, glowing"
3684,BOOK VI.,"in beauty and grace, and the princess marvelled at him, and spake among"
3685,BOOK VI.,"her fair-tressed maidens, saying:"
3686,BOOK VI.,
3687,BOOK VI.,"“Listen, my white-armed maidens, and I will say somewhat. Not without"
3688,BOOK VI.,the will of all the gods who hold Olympus hath this man come among the
3689,BOOK VI.,"godlike Phaeacians. Erewhile he seemed to me uncomely, but now he is"
3690,BOOK VI.,like the gods that keep the wide heaven. Would that such an one might
3691,BOOK VI.,"be called my husband, dwelling here, and that it might please him here"
3692,BOOK VI.,"to abide! But come, my maidens, give the stranger meat and drink.”"
3693,BOOK VI.,
3694,BOOK VI.,"Thus she spake, and they gave ready ear and hearkened, and set beside"
3695,BOOK VI.,"Odysseus meat and drink, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus did eat and"
3696,BOOK VI.,"drink eagerly, for it was long since he had tasted food."
3697,BOOK VI.,
3698,BOOK VI.,Now Nausicaa of the white arms had another thought. She folded the
3699,BOOK VI.,"raiment and stored it in the goodly wain, and yoked the mules strong of"
3700,BOOK VI.,"hoof, and herself climbed into the car. Then she called on Odysseus,"
3701,BOOK VI.,"and spake and hailed him: “Up now, stranger, and rouse thee to go to"
3702,BOOK VI.,"the city, that I may convey thee to the house of my wise father, where,"
3703,BOOK VI.,"I promise thee, thou shalt get knowledge of all the noblest of the"
3704,BOOK VI.,"Phaeacians. But do thou even as I tell thee, and thou seemest a"
3705,BOOK VI.,discreet man enough. So long as we are passing along the fields and
3706,BOOK VI.,"farms of men, do thou fare quickly with the maidens behind the mules"
3707,BOOK VI.,"and the chariot, and I will lead the way. But when we set foot within"
3708,BOOK VI.,"the city,—whereby goes a high wall with towers, and there is a fair"
3709,BOOK VI.,"haven on either side of the town, and narrow is the entrance, and"
3710,BOOK VI.,"curved ships are drawn up on either hand of the mole, for all the folk"
3711,BOOK VI.,"have stations for their vessels, each man one for himself. And there is"
3712,BOOK VI.,"the place of assembly about the goodly temple of Poseidon, furnished"
3713,BOOK VI.,"with heavy stones, deep bedded in the earth. There men look to the gear"
3714,BOOK VI.,"of the black ships, hawsers and sails, and there they fine down the"
3715,BOOK VI.,"oars. For the Phaeacians care not for bow nor quiver, but for masts,"
3716,BOOK VI.,"and oars of ships, and gallant barques, wherein rejoicing they cross"
3717,BOOK VI.,"the grey sea. Their ungracious speech it is that I would avoid, lest"
3718,BOOK VI.,"some man afterward rebuke me, and there are but too many insolent folk"
3719,BOOK VI.,among the people. And some one of the baser sort might meet me and say:
3720,BOOK VI.,"‘Who is this that goes with Nausicaa, this tall and goodly stranger?"
3721,BOOK VI.,"Where found she him? Her husband he will be, her very own. Either she"
3722,BOOK VI.,"has taken in some shipwrecked wanderer of strange men,—for no men dwell"
3723,BOOK VI.,near us; or some god has come in answer to her instant prayer; from
3724,BOOK VI.,"heaven has he descended, and will have her to wife for evermore. Better"
3725,BOOK VI.,"so, if herself she has ranged abroad and found a lord from a strange"
3726,BOOK VI.,"land, for verily she holds in no regard the Phaeacians here in this"
3727,BOOK VI.,"country, the many men and noble who are her wooers.’ So will they"
3728,BOOK VI.,"speak, and this would turn to my reproach. Yea, and I myself would"
3729,BOOK VI.,think it blame of another maiden who did such things in despite of her
3730,BOOK VI.,"friends, her father and mother being still alive, and was conversant"
3731,BOOK VI.,"with men before the day of open wedlock. But, stranger, heed well what"
3732,BOOK VI.,"I say, that as soon as may be thou mayest gain at my father’s hands an"
3733,BOOK VI.,"escort and a safe return. Thou shalt find a fair grove of Athene, a"
3734,BOOK VI.,"poplar grove near the road, and a spring wells forth therein, and a"
3735,BOOK VI.,"meadow lies all around. There is my father’s demesne, and his fruitful"
3736,BOOK VI.,"close, within the sound of a man’s shout from the city. Sit thee down"
3737,BOOK VI.,"there and wait until such time as we may have come into the city, and"
3738,BOOK VI.,reached the house of my father. But when thou deemest that we are got
3739,BOOK VI.,"to the palace, then go up to the city of the Phaeacians, and ask for"
3740,BOOK VI.,"the house of my father Alcinous, high of heart. It is easily known, and"
3741,BOOK VI.,"a young child could be thy guide, for nowise like it are builded the"
3742,BOOK VI.,"houses of the Phaeacians, so goodly is the palace of the hero Alcinous."
3743,BOOK VI.,"But when thou art within the shadow of the halls and the court, pass"
3744,BOOK VI.,"quickly through the great chamber, till thou comest to my mother, who"
3745,BOOK VI.,"sits at the hearth in the light of the fire, weaving yarn of sea-purple"
3746,BOOK VI.,"stain, a wonder to behold. Her chair is leaned against a pillar, and"
3747,BOOK VI.,her maidens sit behind her. And there my father’s throne leans close to
3748,BOOK VI.,"hers, wherein he sits and drinks his wine, like an immortal. Pass thou"
3749,BOOK VI.,"by him, and cast thy hands about my mother’s knees, that thou mayest"
3750,BOOK VI.,"see quickly and with joy the day of thy returning, even if thou art"
3751,BOOK VI.,from a very far country. If but her heart be kindly disposed toward
3752,BOOK VI.,"thee, then is there hope that thou shalt see thy friends, and come to"
3753,BOOK VI.,"thy well-builded house, and to thine own country.”"
3754,BOOK VI.,
3755,BOOK VI.,"She spake, and smote the mules with the shining whip, and quickly they"
3756,BOOK VI.,left behind them the streams of the river. And well they trotted and
3757,BOOK VI.,"well they paced, and she took heed to drive in such wise that the"
3758,BOOK VI.,"maidens and Odysseus might follow on foot, and cunningly she plied the"
3759,BOOK VI.,"lash. Then the sun set, and they came to the famous grove, the sacred"
3760,BOOK VI.,place of Athene; so there the goodly Odysseus sat him down. Then
3761,BOOK VI.,"straightway he prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus: “Listen to me,"
3762,BOOK VI.,"child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied maiden; hear me even now,"
3763,BOOK VI.,"since before thou heardest not when I was smitten on the sea, when the"
3764,BOOK VI.,renowned Earth-shaker smote me. Grant me to come to the Phaeacians as
3765,BOOK VI.,"one dear, and worthy of pity.”"
3766,BOOK VI.,
3767,BOOK VI.,"So he spake in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him; but she did not yet"
3768,BOOK VI.,"appear to him face to face, for she had regard unto her father’s"
3769,BOOK VI.,"brother, who furiously raged against the godlike Odysseus, till he"
3770,BOOK VI.,should come to his own country.
3771,BOOK VI.,
3772,BOOK VI.,
3773,BOOK VI.,
3774,BOOK VII.,BOOK VII.
3775,BOOK VII.,
3776,BOOK VII.,
3777,BOOK VII.,"Odysseus being received at the house of the king Alcinous, the queen"
3778,BOOK VII.,"after supper, taking notice of his garments, gives him occasion to"
3779,BOOK VII.,relate his passage thither on the raft. Alcinous promises him a convoy
3780,BOOK VII.,for the morrow.
3781,BOOK VII.,
3782,BOOK VII.,
3783,BOOK VII.,"So he prayed there, the steadfast goodly Odysseus, while the two strong"
3784,BOOK VII.,mules bare the princess to the town. And when she had now come to the
3785,BOOK VII.,"famous palace of her father, she halted at the gateway, and round her"
3786,BOOK VII.,"gathered her brothers, men like to the immortals, and they loosed the"
3787,BOOK VII.,"mules from under the car, and carried the raiment within. But the"
3788,BOOK VII.,maiden betook her to her chamber; and an aged dame from Aperaea kindled
3789,BOOK VII.,"the fire for her, Eurymedusa, the handmaid of the chamber, whom the"
3790,BOOK VII.,curved ships upon a time had brought from Aperaea; and men chose her as
3791,BOOK VII.,"a prize for Alcinous, seeing that he bare rule over all the Phaeacians,"
3792,BOOK VII.,and the people hearkened to him as to a god. She waited on the
3793,BOOK VII.,white-armed Nausicaa in the palace halls; she was wont to kindle the
3794,BOOK VII.,fire and prepare the supper in the inner chamber.
3795,BOOK VII.,
3796,BOOK VII.,"At that same hour Odysseus roused him to go to the city, and Athene"
3797,BOOK VII.,"shed a deep mist about Odysseus for the favour that she bare him, lest"
3798,BOOK VII.,"any of the Phaeacians, high of heart, should meet him and mock him in"
3799,BOOK VII.,"sharp speech, and ask him who he was. But when he was now about to"
3800,BOOK VII.,"enter the pleasant city, then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, met him,"
3801,BOOK VII.,"in the fashion of a young maiden carrying a pitcher, and she stood over"
3802,BOOK VII.,"against him, and goodly Odysseus inquired of her:"
3803,BOOK VII.,
3804,BOOK VII.,"“My child, couldst thou not lead me to the palace of the lord Alcinous,"
3805,BOOK VII.,"who bears sway among this people? Lo, I am come here, a stranger"
3806,BOOK VII.,"travel-worn from afar, from a distant land; wherefore of the folk who"
3807,BOOK VII.,possess this city and country I know not any man.”
3808,BOOK VII.,
3809,BOOK VII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him saying: “Yea now,"
3810,BOOK VII.,"father and stranger, I will show thee the house that thou bidst me"
3811,BOOK VII.,"declare, for it lies near the palace of my noble father; behold, be"
3812,BOOK VII.,"silent as thou goest, and I will lead the way. And look on no man, nor"
3813,BOOK VII.,"question any. For these men do not gladly suffer strangers, nor"
3814,BOOK VII.,lovingly entreat whoso cometh from a strange land. They trust to the
3815,BOOK VII.,"speed of their swift ships, wherewith they cross the great gulf, for"
3816,BOOK VII.,the Earth-shaker hath vouchsafed them this power. Their ships are swift
3817,BOOK VII.,"as the flight of a bird, or as a thought.”"
3818,BOOK VII.,
3819,BOOK VII.,"Therewith Pallas Athene led the way swiftly, and he followed hard in"
3820,BOOK VII.,"the footsteps of the goddess. And it came to pass that the Phaeacians,"
3821,BOOK VII.,"mariners renowned, marked him not as he went down the city through"
3822,BOOK VII.,"their midst, for the fair tressed Athene suffered it not, that awful"
3823,BOOK VII.,"goddess, who shed a wondrous mist about him, for the favour that she"
3824,BOOK VII.,bare him in her heart. And Odysseus marvelled at the havens and the
3825,BOOK VII.,"gallant ships, yea and the places of assembly of the heroes, and the"
3826,BOOK VII.,"long high walls crowned with palisades, a marvel to behold. But when"
3827,BOOK VII.,"they had now come to the famous palace of the king, the goddess,"
3828,BOOK VII.,"grey-eyed Athene, spake first and said:"
3829,BOOK VII.,
3830,BOOK VII.,"“Lo, here, father and stranger, is the house that thou wouldst have me"
3831,BOOK VII.,"show thee: and thou shalt find kings at the feast, the fosterlings of"
3832,BOOK VII.,"Zeus; enter then, and fear not in thine heart, for the dauntless man is"
3833,BOOK VII.,"the best in every adventure, even though he come from a strange land."
3834,BOOK VII.,Thou shalt find the queen first in the halls; Arete is the name whereby
3835,BOOK VII.,"men call her, and she came even of those that begat the king Alcinous."
3836,BOOK VII.,"First Nausithous was son of Poseidon, the Earth-shaker, and of"
3837,BOOK VII.,"Periboea, the comeliest of women, youngest daughter of great-hearted"
3838,BOOK VII.,"Eurymedon, who once was king among the haughty Giants. Howbeit, he"
3839,BOOK VII.,"destroyed his infatuate people, and was himself destroyed; but Poseidon"
3840,BOOK VII.,"lay with Periboea and begat a son, proud Nausithous, who sometime was"
3841,BOOK VII.,prince among the Phaeacians; and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and
3842,BOOK VII.,"Alcinous. While Rhexenor had as yet no son, Apollo of the silver bow"
3843,BOOK VII.,"smote him, a groom new wed, leaving in his halls one only child Arete;"
3844,BOOK VII.,"and Alcinous took her to wife, and honoured her as no other woman in"
3845,BOOK VII.,"the world is honoured, of all that now-a-days keep house under the hand"
3846,BOOK VII.,"of their lords. Thus she hath, and hath ever had, all worship heartily"
3847,BOOK VII.,from her dear children and from her lord Alcinous and from all the
3848,BOOK VII.,"folk, who look on her as on a goddess, and greet her with reverend"
3849,BOOK VII.,"speech, when she goes about the town. Yea, for she too hath no lack of"
3850,BOOK VII.,"understanding. To whomso she shows favour, even if they be men, she"
3851,BOOK VII.,"ends their feuds.[14] If but her heart be kindly disposed to thee, then"
3852,BOOK VII.,"is there good hope that thou mayest see thy friends, and come to thy"
3853,BOOK VII.,high-roofed home and thine own country.”
3854,BOOK VII.,
3855,BOOK VII.,"[14] v.l. ᾗσιν. And for the women she favours, she ends the feuds of"
3856,BOOK VII.,their lords also.
3857,BOOK VII.,
3858,BOOK VII.,
3859,BOOK VII.,"Therewith grey-eyed Athene departed over the unharvested seas, and left"
3860,BOOK VII.,"pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens, and"
3861,BOOK VII.,entered the good house of Erechtheus. Meanwhile Odysseus went to the
3862,BOOK VII.,"famous palace of Alcinous, and his heart was full of many thoughts as"
3863,BOOK VII.,he stood there or ever he had reached the threshold of bronze. For
3864,BOOK VII.,there was a gleam as it were of sun or moon through the high-roofed
3865,BOOK VII.,hall of great-hearted Alcinous. Brazen were the walls which ran this
3866,BOOK VII.,"way and that from the threshold to the inmost chamber, and round them"
3867,BOOK VII.,"was a frieze of blue, and golden were the doors that closed in the good"
3868,BOOK VII.,house. Silver were the door-posts that were set on the brazen
3869,BOOK VII.,"threshold, and silver the lintel thereupon, and the hook of the door"
3870,BOOK VII.,"was of gold. And on either side stood golden hounds and silver, which"
3871,BOOK VII.,"Hephaestus wrought by his cunning, to guard the palace of great-hearted"
3872,BOOK VII.,"Alcinous, being free from death and age all their days. And within were"
3873,BOOK VII.,"seats arrayed against the wall this way and that, from the threshold"
3874,BOOK VII.,"even to the inmost chamber, and thereon were spread light coverings"
3875,BOOK VII.,"finely woven, the handiwork of women. There the Phaeacian chieftains"
3876,BOOK VII.,"were wont to sit eating and drinking, for they had continual store."
3877,BOOK VII.,"Yea, and there were youths fashioned in gold, standing on firm-set"
3878,BOOK VII.,"bases, with flaming torches in their hands, giving light through the"
3879,BOOK VII.,night to the feasters in the palace. And he had fifty handmaids in the
3880,BOOK VII.,"house, and some grind the yellow grain on the millstone, and others"
3881,BOOK VII.,"weave webs and turn the yarn as they sit, restless as the leaves of the"
3882,BOOK VII.,"tall poplar tree: and the soft olive oil drops off that linen, so"
3883,BOOK VII.,closely is it woven. For as the Phaeacian men are skilled beyond all
3884,BOOK VII.,"others in driving a swift ship upon the deep, even so are the women the"
3885,BOOK VII.,"most cunning at the loom, for Athene hath given them notable wisdom in"
3886,BOOK VII.,all fair handiwork and cunning wit. And without the courtyard hard by
3887,BOOK VII.,"the door is a great garden, off our ploughgates, and a hedge runs round"
3888,BOOK VII.,"on either side. And there grow tall trees blossoming, pear-trees and"
3889,BOOK VII.,"pomegranates, and apple-trees with bright fruit, and sweet figs, and"
3890,BOOK VII.,olives in their bloom. The fruit of these trees never perisheth neither
3891,BOOK VII.,"faileth, winter nor summer, enduring through all the year. Evermore the"
3892,BOOK VII.,West Wind blowing brings some fruits to birth and ripens others. Pear
3893,BOOK VII.,"upon pear waxes old, and apple on apple, yea and cluster ripens upon"
3894,BOOK VII.,"cluster of the grape, and fig upon fig. There too hath he a fruitful"
3895,BOOK VII.,"vineyard planted, whereof the one part is being dried by the heat, a"
3896,BOOK VII.,"sunny plot on level ground, while other grapes men are gathering, and"
3897,BOOK VII.,yet others they are treading in the wine-press. In the foremost row are
3898,BOOK VII.,"unripe grapes that cast the blossom, and others there be that are"
3899,BOOK VII.,"growing black to vintaging. There too, skirting the furthest line, are"
3900,BOOK VII.,"all manner of garden beds, planted trimly, that are perpetually fresh,"
3901,BOOK VII.,"and therein are two fountains of water, whereof one scatters his"
3902,BOOK VII.,"streams all about the garden, and the other runs over against it"
3903,BOOK VII.,"beneath the threshold of the courtyard, and issues by the lofty house,"
3904,BOOK VII.,and thence did the townsfolk draw water. These were the splendid gifts
3905,BOOK VII.,of the gods in the palace of Alcinous.
3906,BOOK VII.,
3907,BOOK VII.,There the steadfast goodly Odysseus stood and gazed. But when he had
3908,BOOK VII.,"gazed at all and wondered, he passed quickly over the threshold within"
3909,BOOK VII.,the house. And he found the captains and the counsellors of the
3910,BOOK VII.,"Phaeacians pouring forth wine to the keen-sighted god, the slayer of"
3911,BOOK VII.,Argos; for to him they poured the last cup when they were minded to
3912,BOOK VII.,"take rest. Now the steadfast goodly Odysseus went through the hall,"
3913,BOOK VII.,"clad in a thick mist, which Athene shed around him, till he came to"
3914,BOOK VII.,Arete and the king Alcinous. And Odysseus cast his hands about the
3915,BOOK VII.,"knees of Arete, and then it was that the wondrous mist melted from off"
3916,BOOK VII.,"him, and a silence fell on them that were within the house at the sight"
3917,BOOK VII.,"of him, and they marvelled as they beheld him. Then Odysseus began his"
3918,BOOK VII.,prayer:
3919,BOOK VII.,
3920,BOOK VII.,"“Arete, daughter of god-like Rhexenor, after many toils am I come to"
3921,BOOK VII.,"thy husband and to thy knees and to these guests, and may the gods"
3922,BOOK VII.,"vouchsafe them a happy life, and may each one leave to his children"
3923,BOOK VII.,after him his substance in his halls and whatever dues of honour the
3924,BOOK VII.,"people have rendered unto him. But speed, I pray you, my parting, that"
3925,BOOK VII.,"I may come the more quickly to mine own country, for already too long"
3926,BOOK VII.,do I suffer affliction far from my friends.”
3927,BOOK VII.,
3928,BOOK VII.,"Therewith he sat him down by the hearth in the ashes at the fire, and"
3929,BOOK VII.,"behold, a dead silence fell on all. And at the last the ancient lord"
3930,BOOK VII.,"Echeneus spake among them, an elder of the Phaeacians, excellent in"
3931,BOOK VII.,speech and skilled in much wisdom of old time. With good will he made
3932,BOOK VII.,harangue and spake among them:
3933,BOOK VII.,
3934,BOOK VII.,"“Alcinous, this truly is not the more seemly way, nor is it fitting"
3935,BOOK VII.,that the stranger should sit upon the ground in the ashes by the
3936,BOOK VII.,"hearth, while these men refrain them, waiting thy word. Nay come, bid"
3937,BOOK VII.,"the stranger arise, and set him on a chair inlaid with silver, and"
3938,BOOK VII.,"command the henchmen to mix the wine, that we may pour forth likewise"
3939,BOOK VII.,"before Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, who attendeth upon reverend"
3940,BOOK VII.,suppliants. And let the housewife give supper to the stranger out of
3941,BOOK VII.,such stores as be within.”
3942,BOOK VII.,
3943,BOOK VII.,"Now when the mighty king Alcinous heard this saying, he took Odysseus,"
3944,BOOK VII.,"the wise and crafty, by the hand, and raised him from the hearth, and"
3945,BOOK VII.,"set him on a shining chair, whence he bade his son give place, valiant"
3946,BOOK VII.,"Laodamas, who sat next him and was his dearest. And a handmaid bare"
3947,BOOK VII.,"water for the hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a"
3948,BOOK VII.,"silver basin to wash withal, and drew to his side a polished table. And"
3949,BOOK VII.,a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set it by him and laid upon the
3950,BOOK VII.,"board many dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. So"
3951,BOOK VII.,the steadfast goodly Odysseus did eat and drink: and then the mighty
3952,BOOK VII.,Alcinous spake unto the henchman:
3953,BOOK VII.,
3954,BOOK VII.,"“Pontonous, mix the bowl and serve out the wine to all in the hall,"
3955,BOOK VII.,"that we may pour forth likewise before Zeus, whose joy is in the"
3956,BOOK VII.,"thunder, who attendeth upon reverend suppliants.”"
3957,BOOK VII.,
3958,BOOK VII.,"So spake he, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine, and served it"
3959,BOOK VII.,"out to all, when he had poured for libation into each cup in turn. But"
3960,BOOK VII.,"when they had poured forth and had drunken to their heart’s content,"
3961,BOOK VII.,Alcinous made harangue and spake among them:
3962,BOOK VII.,
3963,BOOK VII.,"“Hear me, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians, that I may"
3964,BOOK VII.,"speak as my spirit bids me. Now that the feast is over, go ye home and"
3965,BOOK VII.,lie down to rest; and in the morning we will call yet more elders
3966,BOOK VII.,"together, and entertain the stranger in the halls and do fair sacrifice"
3967,BOOK VII.,"to the gods, and thereafter we will likewise bethink us of the convoy,"
3968,BOOK VII.,that so without pain or grief yonder stranger may by our convoy reach
3969,BOOK VII.,"his own country speedily and with joy, even though he be from very far"
3970,BOOK VII.,"away. So shall he suffer no hurt or harm in mid passage, ere he set"
3971,BOOK VII.,foot on his own land; but thereafter he shall endure such things as
3972,BOOK VII.,Fate and the stern spinning women drew off the spindles for him at his
3973,BOOK VII.,birth when his mother bare him. But if he is some deathless god come
3974,BOOK VII.,"down from heaven, then do the gods herein imagine some new device"
3975,BOOK VII.,"against us. For always heretofore the gods appear manifest amongst us,"
3976,BOOK VII.,"whensoever we offer glorious hecatombs, and they feast by our side,"
3977,BOOK VII.,"sitting at the same board; yea, and even if a wayfarer going all alone"
3978,BOOK VII.,"has met with them, they use no disguise, since we are near of kin to"
3979,BOOK VII.,"them, even as are the Cyclôpes and the wild tribes of the Giants.”"
3980,BOOK VII.,
3981,BOOK VII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: “Alcinous, that"
3982,BOOK VII.,thought be far from thee! for I bear no likeness either in form or
3983,BOOK VII.,"fashion to the deathless gods, who keep wide heaven, but to men that"
3984,BOOK VII.,"die. Whomsoever ye know of human kind the heaviest laden with sorrow,"
3985,BOOK VII.,"to them might I liken myself in my griefs. Yea, and I might tell of yet"
3986,BOOK VII.,"other woes, even the long tale of toil that by the gods’ will I"
3987,BOOK VII.,"endured. But as for me, suffer me to sup, afflicted as I am; for nought"
3988,BOOK VII.,"is there more shameless than a ravening belly, which biddeth a man"
3989,BOOK VII.,"perforce be mindful of him, though one be worn and sorrowful in spirit,"
3990,BOOK VII.,even as I have sorrow of heart; yet evermore he biddeth me eat and
3991,BOOK VII.,"drink and maketh me utterly to forget all my sufferings, and commandeth"
3992,BOOK VII.,"me to take my fill. But do ye bestir you at the breaking of the day,"
3993,BOOK VII.,"that so ye may set me, hapless as I am, upon my country’s soil, albeit"
3994,BOOK VII.,"after much suffering. Ah, and may life leave me when I have had sight"
3995,BOOK VII.,"of mine own possessions, my thralls, and my dwelling that is great and"
3996,BOOK VII.,high!”
3997,BOOK VII.,
3998,BOOK VII.,"So spake he, and they all assented thereto, and bade send the stranger"
3999,BOOK VII.,"on his way, for that he had spoken aright. Now when they had poured"
4000,BOOK VII.,"forth and had drunken to their hearts’ content, they went each one to"
4001,BOOK VII.,his house to lay them to rest. But goodly Odysseus was left behind in
4002,BOOK VII.,"the hall, and by him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous; and the maids"
4003,BOOK VII.,cleared away the furniture of the feast; and white-armed Arete first
4004,BOOK VII.,"spake among them. For she knew the mantle and the doublet, when she saw"
4005,BOOK VII.,the goodly raiment that she herself had wrought with the women her
4006,BOOK VII.,handmaids. So she uttered her voice and spake to him winged words:
4007,BOOK VII.,
4008,BOOK VII.,"“Sir, I am bold to ask thee first of this. Who art thou of the sons of"
4009,BOOK VII.,"men, and whence? Who gave thee this raiment? Didst thou not say indeed"
4010,BOOK VII.,that thou camest hither wandering over the deep?”
4011,BOOK VII.,
4012,BOOK VII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her, and said: “’Tis hard, O"
4013,BOOK VII.,"queen, to tell my griefs from end to end, for that the gods of heaven"
4014,BOOK VII.,"have given me griefs in plenty. But this will I declare to thee,"
4015,BOOK VII.,"whereof thou dost question and inquire. There is an isle, Ogygia, that"
4016,BOOK VII.,"lies far off in the sea; there dwells the daughter of Atlas, crafty"
4017,BOOK VII.,"Calypso, of the braided tresses, an awful goddess, nor is any either of"
4018,BOOK VII.,"gods or mortals conversant with her. Howbeit, some god brought me to"
4019,BOOK VII.,"her hearth, wretched man that I am, all alone, for that Zeus with white"
4020,BOOK VII.,bolt crushed my swift ship and cleft it in the midst of the wine-dark
4021,BOOK VII.,"deep. There all the rest of my good company was lost, but I clung with"
4022,BOOK VII.,"fast embrace about the keel of the curved ship, and so was I borne for"
4023,BOOK VII.,nine whole days. And on the tenth dark night the gods brought me nigh
4024,BOOK VII.,"the isle Ogygia, where Calypso of the braided tresses dwells, an awful"
4025,BOOK VII.,"goddess. She took me in, and with all care she cherished me and gave me"
4026,BOOK VII.,"sustenance, and said that she would make me to know not death nor age"
4027,BOOK VII.,for all my days; but never did she win my heart within me. There I
4028,BOOK VII.,"abode for seven years continually, and watered with my tears the"
4029,BOOK VII.,imperishable raiment that Calypso gave me. But when the eighth year
4030,BOOK VII.,"came round in his course, then at last she urged and bade me to be"
4031,BOOK VII.,"gone, by reason of a message from Zeus, or it may be that her own mind"
4032,BOOK VII.,"was turned. So she sent me forth on a well-bound raft, and gave me"
4033,BOOK VII.,"plenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in imperishable"
4034,BOOK VII.,"raiment, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind to blow. For ten days"
4035,BOOK VII.,"and seven I sailed, traversing the deep, and on the eighteenth day the"
4036,BOOK VII.,"shadowy hills of your land showed in sight, and my heart was"
4037,BOOK VII.,"glad,—wretched that I was—for surely I was still to be the mate of much"
4038,BOOK VII.,"sorrow. For Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred up the same, who"
4039,BOOK VII.,"roused against me the winds and stopped my way, and made a wondrous sea"
4040,BOOK VII.,"to swell, nor did the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft, as I"
4041,BOOK VII.,"made ceaseless moan. Thus the storm winds shattered the raft, but as"
4042,BOOK VII.,"for me I cleft my way through the gulf yonder, till the wind bare and"
4043,BOOK VII.,the water brought me nigh your coast. Then as I strove to land upon the
4044,BOOK VII.,"shore, the wave had overwhelmed me, dashing me against the great rocks"
4045,BOOK VII.,"and a desolate place, but at length I gave way and swam back, till I"
4046,BOOK VII.,"came to the river, where the place seemed best in mine eyes, smooth of"
4047,BOOK VII.,"rocks, and withal there was a shelter from the wind. And as I came out"
4048,BOOK VII.,"I sank down, gathering to me my spirit, and immortal night came on."
4049,BOOK VII.,"Then I gat me forth and away from the heaven-fed river, and laid me to"
4050,BOOK VII.,"sleep in the bushes and strewed leaves about me, and the god shed over"
4051,BOOK VII.,"me infinite sleep. There among the leaves I slept, stricken at heart,"
4052,BOOK VII.,"all the night long, even till the morning and mid-day. And the sun sank"
4053,BOOK VII.,when sweet sleep let me free. And I was aware of the company of thy
4054,BOOK VII.,"daughter disporting them upon the sand, and there was she in the midst"
4055,BOOK VII.,"of them like unto the goddesses. To her I made my supplication, and she"
4056,BOOK VII.,"showed no lack of a good understanding, behaving so as thou couldst not"
4057,BOOK VII.,hope for in chancing upon one so young; for the younger folk lack
4058,BOOK VII.,"wisdom always. She gave me bread enough and red wine, and let wash me"
4059,BOOK VII.,"in the river and bestowed on me these garments. Herein, albeit in sore"
4060,BOOK VII.,"distress, have I told thee all the truth.”"
4061,BOOK VII.,
4062,BOOK VII.,"And Alcinous answered again, and spake saying: “Sir, surely this was no"
4063,BOOK VII.,"right thought of my daughter, in that she brought thee not to our house"
4064,BOOK VII.,"with the women her handmaids, though thou didst first entreat her"
4065,BOOK VII.,grace.”
4066,BOOK VII.,
4067,BOOK VII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered, and said unto him: “My lord,"
4068,BOOK VII.,"chide not, I pray thee, for this the blameless maiden. For indeed she"
4069,BOOK VII.,"bade me follow with her company, but I would not for fear and very"
4070,BOOK VII.,"shame, lest perchance thine heart might be clouded at the sight; for a"
4071,BOOK VII.,"jealous race upon the earth are we, the tribes of men.”"
4072,BOOK VII.,
4073,BOOK VII.,"And Alcinous answered yet again, and spake saying: “Sir, my heart"
4074,BOOK VII.,within me is not of such temper as to have been wroth without a cause:
4075,BOOK VII.,"due measure in all things is best. Would to father Zeus, and Athene,"
4076,BOOK VII.,"and Apollo, would that so goodly a man as thou art, and like-minded"
4077,BOOK VII.,"with me, thou wouldst wed my daughter, and be called my son, here"
4078,BOOK VII.,"abiding: so would I give thee house and wealth, if thou wouldst stay of"
4079,BOOK VII.,thine own will: but against thy will shall none of the Phaeacians keep
4080,BOOK VII.,thee: never be this well-pleasing in the eyes of father Zeus! And now I
4081,BOOK VII.,"ordain an escort for thee on a certain day, that thou mayst surely"
4082,BOOK VII.,"know, and that day the morrow. Then shalt thou lay thee down overcome"
4083,BOOK VII.,"by sleep, and they the while shall smite the calm waters, till thou"
4084,BOOK VII.,"come to thy country and thy house, and whatsoever place is dear to"
4085,BOOK VII.,"thee, even though it be much farther than Euboea, which certain of our"
4086,BOOK VII.,"men say is the farthest of lands, they who saw it, when they carried"
4087,BOOK VII.,"Rhadamanthus, of the fair hair, to visit Tityos, son of Gaia. Even"
4088,BOOK VII.,"thither they went, and accomplished the journey on the self-same day"
4089,BOOK VII.,"and won home again, and were not weary. And now shalt thou know for"
4090,BOOK VII.,"thyself how far my ships are the best, and how my young men excel at"
4091,BOOK VII.,tossing the salt water with the oar-blade.”
4092,BOOK VII.,
4093,BOOK VII.,"So spake he, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced; and then he"
4094,BOOK VII.,"uttered a word in prayer, and called aloud to Zeus: “Father Zeus, oh"
4095,BOOK VII.,"that Alcinous may fulfil all that he hath said, so may his fame never"
4096,BOOK VII.,"be quenched upon the earth, the grain-giver, and I should come to mine"
4097,BOOK VII.,own land!”
4098,BOOK VII.,
4099,BOOK VII.,Thus they spake one to the other. And white-armed Arete bade her
4100,BOOK VII.,"handmaids set out bedsteads beneath the gallery, and cast fair purple"
4101,BOOK VII.,"blankets over them, and spread coverlets above, and thereon lay thick"
4102,BOOK VII.,mantles to be a clothing over all. So they went from the hall with
4103,BOOK VII.,torch in hand. But when they had busied them and spread the good
4104,BOOK VII.,"bedstead, they stood by Odysseus and called unto him, saying:"
4105,BOOK VII.,
4106,BOOK VII.,"“Up now, stranger, and get thee to sleep, thy bed is made.”"
4107,BOOK VII.,
4108,BOOK VII.,"So spake they, and it seemed to him that rest was wondrous good. So he"
4109,BOOK VII.,"slept there, the steadfast goodly Odysseus, on the jointed bedstead,"
4110,BOOK VII.,beneath the echoing gallery. But Alcinous laid him down in the
4111,BOOK VII.,"innermost chamber of the high house, and by him the lady his wife"
4112,BOOK VII.,arrayed bedstead and bedding.
4113,BOOK VII.,
4114,BOOK VII.,
4115,BOOK VII.,
4116,BOOK VIII.,BOOK VIII.
4117,BOOK VIII.,
4118,BOOK VIII.,
4119,BOOK VIII.,"The next day’s entertainment of Odysseus, where he sees them contend in"
4120,BOOK VIII.,"wrestling and other exercises, and upon provocation took up a greater"
4121,BOOK VIII.,"stone than that which they were throwing, and overthrew them all."
4122,BOOK VIII.,Alcinous and the lords give him presents. And how the king asked his
4123,BOOK VIII.,"name, his country, and his adventures."
4124,BOOK VIII.,
4125,BOOK VIII.,
4126,BOOK VIII.,"Now when early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then the mighty"
4127,BOOK VIII.,"king Alcinous gat him up from his bed; and Odysseus, of the seed of"
4128,BOOK VIII.,"Zeus, likewise uprose, the waster of cities. And the mighty king"
4129,BOOK VIII.,"Alcinous led the way to the assembly place of the Phaeacians, which"
4130,BOOK VIII.,"they had established hard by the ships. So when they had come thither,"
4131,BOOK VIII.,"and sat them down on the polished stones close by each other, Pallas"
4132,BOOK VIII.,"Athene went on her way through the town, in the semblance of the herald"
4133,BOOK VIII.,"of wise Alcinous, devising a return for the great-hearted Odysseus."
4134,BOOK VIII.,"Then standing by each man she spake, saying:"
4135,BOOK VIII.,
4136,BOOK VIII.,"“Hither now get ye to the assembly, ye captains and counsellors of the"
4137,BOOK VIII.,"Phaeacians, that ye may learn concerning the stranger, who hath lately"
4138,BOOK VIII.,"come to the palace of wise Alcinous, in his wanderings over the deep,"
4139,BOOK VIII.,and his form is like the deathless gods.”
4140,BOOK VIII.,
4141,BOOK VIII.,"Therewith she aroused the spirit and desire of each one, and speedily"
4142,BOOK VIII.,the meeting-places and seats were filled with men that came to the
4143,BOOK VIII.,"gathering: yea, and many an one marvelled at the sight of the wise son"
4144,BOOK VIII.,"of Laertes, for wondrous was the grace Athene poured upon his head and"
4145,BOOK VIII.,"shoulders, and she made him greater and more mighty to behold, that he"
4146,BOOK VIII.,"might win love and worship and honour among all the Phaeacians, and"
4147,BOOK VIII.,"that he might accomplish many feats, wherein the Phaeacians made trial"
4148,BOOK VIII.,"of Odysseus. Now when they were gathered and come together, Alcinous"
4149,BOOK VIII.,made harangue and spake among them:
4150,BOOK VIII.,
4151,BOOK VIII.,"“Harken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and I will say"
4152,BOOK VIII.,"that which my spirit within me bids me utter. This stranger, I know not"
4153,BOOK VIII.,"who he is, hath come to my house in his wandering, whether from the men"
4154,BOOK VIII.,"of the dawning or the westward, and he presses for a convoy, and prays"
4155,BOOK VIII.,"that it be assured to him. So let us, as in time past, speed on the"
4156,BOOK VIII.,"convoy. For never, nay never, doth any man who cometh to my house,"
4157,BOOK VIII.,"abide here long in sorrow for want of help upon his way. Nay, come let"
4158,BOOK VIII.,"us draw down a black ship to the fair salt sea, for her first voyage,"
4159,BOOK VIII.,"and let them choose fifty and two noble youths throughout the township,"
4160,BOOK VIII.,who have been proved heretofore the best. And when ye have made fast
4161,BOOK VIII.,"the oars upon the benches, step all a shore, and thereafter come to our"
4162,BOOK VIII.,"house, and quickly fall to feasting; and I will make good provision for"
4163,BOOK VIII.,"all. To the noble youths I give this commandment; but ye others,"
4164,BOOK VIII.,"sceptred kings, come to my fair dwelling, that we may entertain the"
4165,BOOK VIII.,"stranger in the halls, and let no man make excuse. Moreover, bid hither"
4166,BOOK VIII.,"the divine minstrel, Demodocus, for the god hath given minstrelsy to"
4167,BOOK VIII.,"him as to none other, to make men glad in what way soever his spirit"
4168,BOOK VIII.,stirs him to sing.”
4169,BOOK VIII.,
4170,BOOK VIII.,"He spake and led the way, and the sceptred kings accompanied him, while"
4171,BOOK VIII.,"the henchmen went for the divine minstrel. And chosen youths, fifty and"
4172,BOOK VIII.,"two, departed at his command, to the shore of the unharvested sea. But"
4173,BOOK VIII.,"after they had gone down to the ship and to the sea, first of all they"
4174,BOOK VIII.,"drew the ship down to the deep water, and placed the mast and sails in"
4175,BOOK VIII.,"the black ship, and fixed the oars in leathern loops, all orderly, and"
4176,BOOK VIII.,spread forth the white sails. And they moored her high out in the shore
4177,BOOK VIII.,"water, and thereafter went on their way to the great palace of the wise"
4178,BOOK VIII.,Alcinous. Now the galleries and the courts and the rooms were thronged
4179,BOOK VIII.,"with men that came to the gathering, for there were many, young and"
4180,BOOK VIII.,"old. Then Alcinous sacrificed twelve sheep among them, and eight boars"
4181,BOOK VIII.,"with flashing tusks, and two oxen with trailing feet. These they flayed"
4182,BOOK VIII.,"and made ready, and dressed a goodly feast."
4183,BOOK VIII.,
4184,BOOK VIII.,"Then the henchman drew near, leading with him the beloved minstrel,"
4185,BOOK VIII.,"whom the muse loved dearly, and she gave him both good and evil; of his"
4186,BOOK VIII.,"sight she reft him, but granted him sweet song. Then Pontonous, the"
4187,BOOK VIII.,"henchman, set for him a high chair inlaid with silver, in the midst of"
4188,BOOK VIII.,"the guests, leaning it against the tall pillar, and he hung the loud"
4189,BOOK VIII.,"lyre on a pin, close above his head, and showed him how to lay his"
4190,BOOK VIII.,"hands on it. And close by him he placed a basket, and a fair table, and"
4191,BOOK VIII.,"a goblet of wine by his side, to drink when his spirit bade him. So"
4192,BOOK VIII.,they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer spread before
4193,BOOK VIII.,"them. But after they had put from them the desire of meat and drink,"
4194,BOOK VIII.,"the Muse stirred the minstrel to sing the songs of famous men, even"
4195,BOOK VIII.,"that lay whereof the fame had then reached the wide heaven, namely, the"
4196,BOOK VIII.,"quarrel between Odysseus and Achilles, son of Peleus; how once on a"
4197,BOOK VIII.,"time they contended in fierce words at a rich festival of the gods, but"
4198,BOOK VIII.,"Agamemnon, king of men, was inly glad when the noblest of the Achaeans"
4199,BOOK VIII.,fell at variance. For so Phoebus Apollo in his soothsaying had told him
4200,BOOK VIII.,"that it must be, in goodly Pytho, what time he crossed the threshold of"
4201,BOOK VIII.,"stone, to seek to the oracle. For in those days the first wave of woe"
4202,BOOK VIII.,was rolling on Trojans and Danaans through the counsel of great Zeus.
4203,BOOK VIII.,
4204,BOOK VIII.,This song it was that the famous minstrel sang; but Odysseus caught his
4205,BOOK VIII.,"great purple cloak with his stalwart hands, and drew it down over his"
4206,BOOK VIII.,"head, and hid his comely face, for he was ashamed to shed tears beneath"
4207,BOOK VIII.,"his brows in presence of the Phaeacians. Yea, and oft as the divine"
4208,BOOK VIII.,"minstrel paused in his song, Odysseus would wipe away the tears, and"
4209,BOOK VIII.,"draw the cloak from off his head, and take the two-handled goblet and"
4210,BOOK VIII.,"pour forth before the gods. But whensoever he began again, and the"
4211,BOOK VIII.,"chiefs of the Phaeacians stirred him to sing, in delight at the lay,"
4212,BOOK VIII.,again would Odysseus cover up his head and make moan. Now none of all
4213,BOOK VIII.,"the company marked him weeping, but Alcinous alone noted it and was"
4214,BOOK VIII.,ware thereof as he sat by him and heard him groaning heavily. And
4215,BOOK VIII.,"presently he spake among the Phaeacians, masters of the oar:"
4216,BOOK VIII.,
4217,BOOK VIII.,"“Hearken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians, now have our"
4218,BOOK VIII.,"souls been satisfied with the good feast, and with the lyre, which is"
4219,BOOK VIII.,"the mate of the rich banquet. Let us go forth anon, and make trial of"
4220,BOOK VIII.,"divers games, that the stranger may tell his friends, when home he"
4221,BOOK VIII.,"returneth, how greatly we excel all men in boxing, and wrestling, and"
4222,BOOK VIII.,"leaping, and speed of foot.”"
4223,BOOK VIII.,
4224,BOOK VIII.,"He spake, and led the way, and they went with him. And the henchman"
4225,BOOK VIII.,"hung the loud lyre on the pin, and took the hand of Demodocus, and let"
4226,BOOK VIII.,"him forth from the hall, and guided him by the same way, whereby those"
4227,BOOK VIII.,"others, the chiefs of the Phaeacians, had gone to gaze upon the games."
4228,BOOK VIII.,"So they went on their way to the place of assembly, and with them a"
4229,BOOK VIII.,great company innumerable; and many a noble youth stood up to play.
4230,BOOK VIII.,"There rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus, and Elatreus, and Nauteus, and"
4231,BOOK VIII.,"Prymneus, and Anchialus, and Eretmeus, and Ponteus, and Proreus, Thoon,"
4232,BOOK VIII.,"and Anabesineus, and Amphialus, son of Polyneus, son of Tekton, and"
4233,BOOK VIII.,"likewise Euryalus, the peer of murderous Ares, the son of Naubolus, who"
4234,BOOK VIII.,in face and form was goodliest of all the Phaeacians next to noble
4235,BOOK VIII.,"Laodamas. And there stood up the three sons of noble Alcinous,"
4236,BOOK VIII.,"Laodamas, and Halius, and god-like Clytoneus. And behold, these all"
4237,BOOK VIII.,first tried the issue in the foot race. From the very start they
4238,BOOK VIII.,"strained at utmost speed: and all together they flew forward swiftly,"
4239,BOOK VIII.,raising the dust along the plain. And noble Clytoneus was far the
4240,BOOK VIII.,"swiftest of them all in running, and by the length of the furrow that"
4241,BOOK VIII.,"mules cleave in a fallow field,[15] so far did he shoot to the front,"
4242,BOOK VIII.,"and came to the crowd by the lists, while those others were left"
4243,BOOK VIII.,"behind. Then they made trial of strong wrestling, and here in turn"
4244,BOOK VIII.,Euryalus excelled all the best. And in leaping Amphialus was far the
4245,BOOK VIII.,"foremost, and Elatreus in weight-throwing, and in boxing Laodamas, the"
4246,BOOK VIII.,good son of Alcinous. Now when they had all taken their pleasure in the
4247,BOOK VIII.,"games, Laodamas, son of Alcinous, spake among them:"
4248,BOOK VIII.,
4249,BOOK VIII.,[15] The distance here indicated seems to be that which the mule goes
4250,BOOK VIII.,"in ploughing, without pausing to take breath."
4251,BOOK VIII.,
4252,BOOK VIII.,
4253,BOOK VIII.,"“Come, my friends, let us ask the stranger whether he is skilled or"
4254,BOOK VIII.,"practised in any sport. Ill fashioned, at least, he is not in his"
4255,BOOK VIII.,"thighs and sinewy legs and hands withal, and his stalwart neck and"
4256,BOOK VIII.,"mighty strength: yea and he lacks not youth, but is crushed by many"
4257,BOOK VIII.,troubles. For I tell thee there is nought else worse than the sea to
4258,BOOK VIII.,"confound a man, how hardy soever he may be.”"
4259,BOOK VIII.,
4260,BOOK VIII.,"And Euryalus in turn made answer, and said: “Laodamas, verily thou hast"
4261,BOOK VIII.,"spoken this word in season. Go now thyself and challenge him, and"
4262,BOOK VIII.,declare thy saying.”
4263,BOOK VIII.,
4264,BOOK VIII.,"Now when the good son of Alcinous heard this, he went and stood in the"
4265,BOOK VIII.,"midst, and spake unto Odysseus: “Come, do thou too, father and"
4266,BOOK VIII.,"stranger, try thy skill in the sports, if haply thou art practised in"
4267,BOOK VIII.,"any; and thou art like to have knowledge of games, for there is no"
4268,BOOK VIII.,"greater glory for a man while yet he lives, than that which he achieves"
4269,BOOK VIII.,"by hand and foot. Come, then, make essay, and cast away care from thy"
4270,BOOK VIII.,"soul: thy journey shall not now be long delayed; lo, thy ship is even"
4271,BOOK VIII.,"now drawn down to the sea, and the men of thy company are ready.”"
4272,BOOK VIII.,
4273,BOOK VIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying; “Laodamas,"
4274,BOOK VIII.,"wherefore do ye mock me, requiring this thing of me? Sorrow is far"
4275,BOOK VIII.,"nearer my heart than sports, for much have I endured and laboured"
4276,BOOK VIII.,"sorely in time past, and now I sit in this your gathering, craving my"
4277,BOOK VIII.,"return, and making my prayer to the king and all the people.”"
4278,BOOK VIII.,
4279,BOOK VIII.,"And Euryalus answered, and rebuked him to his face: “No truly,"
4280,BOOK VIII.,"stranger, nor do I think thee at all like one that is skilled in games,"
4281,BOOK VIII.,"whereof there are many among men, rather art thou such an one as comes"
4282,BOOK VIII.,"and goes in a benched ship, a master of sailors that are merchantmen,"
4283,BOOK VIII.,"one with a memory for his freight, or that hath the charge of a cargo"
4284,BOOK VIII.,"homeward bound, and of greedily gotten gains; thou seemest not a man of"
4285,BOOK VIII.,thy hands.”
4286,BOOK VIII.,
4287,BOOK VIII.,Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him and said:
4288,BOOK VIII.,"“Stranger, thou hast not spoken well; thou art like a man presumptuous."
4289,BOOK VIII.,"So true it is that the gods do not give every gracious gift to all,"
4290,BOOK VIII.,"neither shapeliness, nor wisdom, nor skilled speech. For one man is"
4291,BOOK VIII.,"feebler than another in presence, yet the god crowns his words with"
4292,BOOK VIII.,"beauty, and men behold him and rejoice, and his speech runs surely on"
4293,BOOK VIII.,"his way with a sweet modesty, and he shines forth among the gathering"
4294,BOOK VIII.,"of his people, and as he passes through the town men gaze on him as a"
4295,BOOK VIII.,"god. Another again is like the deathless gods for beauty, but his words"
4296,BOOK VIII.,have no crown of grace about them; even as thou art in comeliness
4297,BOOK VIII.,"pre-eminent, nor could a god himself fashion thee for the better, but"
4298,BOOK VIII.,"in wit thou art a weakling. Yea, thou hast stirred my spirit in my"
4299,BOOK VIII.,"breast by speaking thus amiss. I am not all unversed in sports, as thy"
4300,BOOK VIII.,"words go, but methinks I was among the foremost while as yet I trusted"
4301,BOOK VIII.,"in my youth and my hands, but now am I holden in misery and pains: for"
4302,BOOK VIII.,I have endured much in passing through the wars of men and the grievous
4303,BOOK VIII.,"waves of the sea. Yet even so, for all my affliction, I will essay the"
4304,BOOK VIII.,"games, for thy word hath bitten to the quick, and thou hast roused me"
4305,BOOK VIII.,with thy saying.”
4306,BOOK VIII.,
4307,BOOK VIII.,"He spake, and clad even as he was in his mantle leaped to his feet, and"
4308,BOOK VIII.,"caught up a weight larger than the rest, a huge weight heavier far than"
4309,BOOK VIII.,those wherewith the Phaeacians contended in casting. With one whirl he
4310,BOOK VIII.,"sent it from his stout hand, and the stone flew hurtling: and the"
4311,BOOK VIII.,"Phaeacians, of the long oars, those mariners renowned, crouched to"
4312,BOOK VIII.,"earth beneath the rushing of the stone. Beyond all the marks it flew,"
4313,BOOK VIII.,"so lightly it sped from his hand, and Athene in the fashion of a man"
4314,BOOK VIII.,"marked the place, and spake and hailed him:"
4315,BOOK VIII.,
4316,BOOK VIII.,"“Yea, even a blind man, stranger, might discern that token if he groped"
4317,BOOK VIII.,"for it, for it is in no wise lost among the throng of the others, but"
4318,BOOK VIII.,is far the first; for this bout then take heart: not one of the
4319,BOOK VIII.,Phaeacians shall attain thereunto or overpass it.”
4320,BOOK VIII.,
4321,BOOK VIII.,"So spake she; and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced and was glad,"
4322,BOOK VIII.,for that he saw a true friend in the lists. Then with a lighter heart
4323,BOOK VIII.,he spake amid the Phaeacians:
4324,BOOK VIII.,
4325,BOOK VIII.,"“Now reach ye this throw, young men, if ye may; and soon, methinks,"
4326,BOOK VIII.,"will I cast another after it, as far or yet further. And whomsoever of"
4327,BOOK VIII.,"the rest his heart and spirit stir thereto, hither let him come and try"
4328,BOOK VIII.,"the issue with me, in boxing or in wrestling or even in the foot race,"
4329,BOOK VIII.,"I care not which, for ye have greatly angered me: let any of all the"
4330,BOOK VIII.,"Phaeacians come save Laodamas alone, for he is mine host: who would"
4331,BOOK VIII.,strive with one that entreated him kindly? Witless and worthless is the
4332,BOOK VIII.,"man, whoso challengeth his host that receiveth him in a strange land,"
4333,BOOK VIII.,"he doth but maim his own estate. But for the rest, I refuse none and"
4334,BOOK VIII.,"hold none lightly, but I fain would know and prove them face to face."
4335,BOOK VIII.,"For I am no weakling in all sports, even in the feats of men. I know"
4336,BOOK VIII.,"well how to handle the polished bow, and ever the first would I be to"
4337,BOOK VIII.,"shoot and smite my man in the press of foes, even though many of my"
4338,BOOK VIII.,"company stood by, and were aiming at the enemy. Alone Philoctetes in"
4339,BOOK VIII.,the Trojan land surpassed me with the bow in our Achaean archery. But I
4340,BOOK VIII.,"avow myself far more excellent than all besides, of the mortals that"
4341,BOOK VIII.,are now upon the earth and live by bread. Yet with the men of old time
4342,BOOK VIII.,"I would not match me, neither with Heracles nor with Eurytus of"
4343,BOOK VIII.,"Oechalia, who contended even with the deathless gods for the prize of"
4344,BOOK VIII.,"archery. Wherefore the great Eurytus perished all too soon, nor did old"
4345,BOOK VIII.,"age come on him in his halls, for Apollo slew him in his wrath, seeing"
4346,BOOK VIII.,that he challenged him to shoot a match. And with the spear I can throw
4347,BOOK VIII.,further than any other man can shoot an arrow. Only I doubt that in the
4348,BOOK VIII.,"foot race some of the Phaeacians may outstrip me, for I have been"
4349,BOOK VIII.,"shamefully broken in many waters, seeing that there was no continual"
4350,BOOK VIII.,sustenance on board; wherefore my knees are loosened.”
4351,BOOK VIII.,
4352,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he and all kept silence; and Alcinous alone answered him,"
4353,BOOK VIII.,saying:
4354,BOOK VIII.,
4355,BOOK VIII.,"“Stranger, forasmuch as these thy words are not ill-taken in our"
4356,BOOK VIII.,"gathering, but thou wouldest fain show forth the valour which keeps"
4357,BOOK VIII.,"thee company, being angry that yonder man stood by thee in the lists,"
4358,BOOK VIII.,"and taunted thee, in such sort as no mortal would speak lightly of"
4359,BOOK VIII.,"thine excellence, who had knowledge of sound words; nay now, mark my"
4360,BOOK VIII.,"speech; so shalt thou have somewhat to tell another hero, when with thy"
4361,BOOK VIII.,"wife and children thou suppest in thy halls, and recallest our prowess,"
4362,BOOK VIII.,what deeds Zeus bestoweth even upon us from our fathers’ days even
4363,BOOK VIII.,"until now. For we are no perfect boxers, nor wrestlers, but speedy"
4364,BOOK VIII.,"runners, and the best of seamen; and dear to us ever is the banquet,"
4365,BOOK VIII.,"and the harp, and the dance, and changes of raiment, and the warm bath,"
4366,BOOK VIII.,"and love, and sleep. Lo, now arise, ye dancers of the Phaeacians, the"
4367,BOOK VIII.,"best in the land, and make sport, that so the stranger may tell his"
4368,BOOK VIII.,"friends, when he returneth home, how far we surpass all men besides in"
4369,BOOK VIII.,"seamanship, and speed of foot, and in the dance and song. And let one"
4370,BOOK VIII.,"go quickly, and fetch for Demodocus the loud lyre which is lying"
4371,BOOK VIII.,somewhere in our halls.”
4372,BOOK VIII.,
4373,BOOK VIII.,"So spake Alcinous the godlike, and the henchman rose to bear the hollow"
4374,BOOK VIII.,"lyre from the king’s palace. Then stood up nine chosen men in all, the"
4375,BOOK VIII.,"judges of the people, who were wont to order all things in the lists"
4376,BOOK VIII.,"aright. So they levelled the place for the dance, and made a fair ring"
4377,BOOK VIII.,and a wide. And the henchman drew near bearing the loud lyre to
4378,BOOK VIII.,"Demodocus, who gat him into the midst, and round him stood boys in"
4379,BOOK VIII.,"their first bloom, skilled in the dance, and they smote the good floor"
4380,BOOK VIII.,"with their feet. And Odysseus gazed at the twinklings of the feet, and"
4381,BOOK VIII.,marvelled in spirit.
4382,BOOK VIII.,
4383,BOOK VIII.,"Now as the minstrel touched the lyre, he lifted up his voice in sweet"
4384,BOOK VIII.,"song, and he sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite, of the fair crown,"
4385,BOOK VIII.,how at the first they lay together in the house of Hephaestus privily;
4386,BOOK VIII.,"and Ares gave her many gifts, and dishonoured the marriage bed of the"
4387,BOOK VIII.,"lord Hephaestus. And anon there came to him one to report the thing,"
4388,BOOK VIII.,"even Helios, that had seen them at their pastime. Now when Hephaestus"
4389,BOOK VIII.,"heard the bitter tidings, he went his way to the forge, devising evil"
4390,BOOK VIII.,"in the deep of his heart, and set the great anvil on the stithy, and"
4391,BOOK VIII.,"wrought fetters that none might snap or loosen, that the lovers might"
4392,BOOK VIII.,there unmoveably remain. Now when he had forged the crafty net in his
4393,BOOK VIII.,"anger against Ares, he went on his way to the chamber where his"
4394,BOOK VIII.,"marriage bed was set out, and strewed his snares all about the posts of"
4395,BOOK VIII.,"the bed, and many too were hung aloft from the main beam, subtle as"
4396,BOOK VIII.,"spiders’ webs, so that none might see them, even of the blessed gods:"
4397,BOOK VIII.,so cunningly were they forged. Now after he had done winding the snare
4398,BOOK VIII.,"about the bed, he made as though he would go to Lemnos, that stablished"
4399,BOOK VIII.,"castle, and this was far the dearest of all lands in his sight. But"
4400,BOOK VIII.,"Ares of the golden rein kept no blind watch, what time he saw"
4401,BOOK VIII.,"Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, depart afar. So he went on his way to"
4402,BOOK VIII.,"the house of renowned Hephaestus, eager for the love of crowned"
4403,BOOK VIII.,"Cytherea. Now she was but newly come from her sire, the mighty Cronion,"
4404,BOOK VIII.,"and as it chanced had sat her down; and Ares entered the house, and"
4405,BOOK VIII.,"clasped her hand, and spake, and hailed her:"
4406,BOOK VIII.,
4407,BOOK VIII.,"“Come, my beloved, let us to bed, and take our pleasure of love, for"
4408,BOOK VIII.,Hephaestus is no longer among his own people; methinks he is already
4409,BOOK VIII.,"gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men of savage speech.”"
4410,BOOK VIII.,
4411,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and a glad thing it seemed to her to lie with him. So they"
4412,BOOK VIII.,"twain went to the couch, and laid them to sleep, and around them clung"
4413,BOOK VIII.,"the cunning bonds of skilled Hephaestus, so that they could not move"
4414,BOOK VIII.,"nor raise a limb. Then at the last they knew it, when there was no way"
4415,BOOK VIII.,"to flee. Now the famous god of the strong arms drew near to them,"
4416,BOOK VIII.,having turned him back ere he reached the land of Lemnos. For Helios
4417,BOOK VIII.,"had kept watch, and told him all. So heavy at heart he went his way to"
4418,BOOK VIII.,"his house, and stood at the entering in of the gate, and wild rage gat"
4419,BOOK VIII.,"hold of him, and he cried terribly, and shouted to all the gods:"
4420,BOOK VIII.,
4421,BOOK VIII.,"“Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods, that live for ever, come"
4422,BOOK VIII.,"hither, that ye may see a mirthful thing and a cruel, for that"
4423,BOOK VIII.,"Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever dishonours me by reason of my"
4424,BOOK VIII.,"lameness, and sets her heart on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair"
4425,BOOK VIII.,"and straight of limb, but as for me, feeble was I born. Howbeit, there"
4426,BOOK VIII.,"is none to blame but my father and mother,—would they had never"
4427,BOOK VIII.,"begotten me! But now shall ye see where these have gone up into my bed,"
4428,BOOK VIII.,"and sleep together in love; and I am troubled at the sight. Yet,"
4429,BOOK VIII.,"methinks, they will not care to lie thus even for a little while"
4430,BOOK VIII.,"longer, despite their great love. Soon will they have no desire to"
4431,BOOK VIII.,"sleep together, but the snare and the bond shall hold them, till her"
4432,BOOK VIII.,"sire give back to me the gifts of wooing, one and all, those that I"
4433,BOOK VIII.,bestowed upon him for the hand of his shameless girl; for that his
4434,BOOK VIII.,"daughter is fair, but without discretion.”"
4435,BOOK VIII.,
4436,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he; and lo, the gods gathered together to the house of the"
4437,BOOK VIII.,"brazen floor. Poseidon came, the girdler of the earth, and Hermes came,"
4438,BOOK VIII.,"the bringer of luck, and prince Apollo came, the archer. But the lady"
4439,BOOK VIII.,"goddesses abode each within her house for shame. So the gods, the"
4440,BOOK VIII.,"givers of good things, stood in the porch: and laughter unquenchable"
4441,BOOK VIII.,"arose among the blessed gods, as they beheld the sleight of cunning"
4442,BOOK VIII.,"Hephaestus. And thus would one speak, looking to his neighbour:"
4443,BOOK VIII.,
4444,BOOK VIII.,"“Ill deed, ill speed! The slow catcheth the swift! Lo, how Hephaestus,"
4445,BOOK VIII.,"slow as he is, hath overtaken Ares, albeit he is the swiftest of the"
4446,BOOK VIII.,"gods that hold Olympus, by his craft hath he taken him despite his"
4447,BOOK VIII.,lameness; wherefore surely Ares oweth the fine of the adulterer.” Thus
4448,BOOK VIII.,"they spake one to the other. But the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, spake to"
4449,BOOK VIII.,Hermes:
4450,BOOK VIII.,
4451,BOOK VIII.,"“Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger and giver of good things, wouldst thou"
4452,BOOK VIII.,"be fain, aye, pressed by strong bonds though it might be, to lie on the"
4453,BOOK VIII.,couch by golden Aphrodite?”
4454,BOOK VIII.,
4455,BOOK VIII.,"Then the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered him: “I would that"
4456,BOOK VIII.,"this might be, Apollo, my prince of archery! So might thrice as many"
4457,BOOK VIII.,"bonds innumerable encompass me about, and all ye gods be looking on and"
4458,BOOK VIII.,"all the goddesses, yet would I lie by golden Aphrodite.”"
4459,BOOK VIII.,
4460,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and laughter rose among the deathless gods. Howbeit,"
4461,BOOK VIII.,"Poseidon laughed not, but was instant with Hephaestus, the renowned"
4462,BOOK VIII.,"artificer, to loose the bonds of Ares: and he uttered his voice, and"
4463,BOOK VIII.,spake to him winged words:
4464,BOOK VIII.,
4465,BOOK VIII.,"“Loose him, I pray thee, and I promise even as thou biddest me, that he"
4466,BOOK VIII.,shall himself pay all fair forfeit in the presence of the deathless
4467,BOOK VIII.,gods.”
4468,BOOK VIII.,
4469,BOOK VIII.,Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him: “Require not this
4470,BOOK VIII.,"of me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth. Evil are evil folk’s pledges to"
4471,BOOK VIII.,"hold. How could I keep thee bound among the deathless gods, if Ares"
4472,BOOK VIII.,"were to depart, avoiding the debt and the bond?”"
4473,BOOK VIII.,
4474,BOOK VIII.,"Then Poseidon answered him, shaker of the earth: “Hephaestus, even if"
4475,BOOK VIII.,"Ares avoid the debt and flee away, I myself will pay thee all.”"
4476,BOOK VIII.,
4477,BOOK VIII.,Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him: “It may not be
4478,BOOK VIII.,"that I should say thee nay, neither is it meet.”"
4479,BOOK VIII.,
4480,BOOK VIII.,"Therewith the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds, and the twain, when"
4481,BOOK VIII.,"they were freed from that strong bond, sprang up straightway, and"
4482,BOOK VIII.,"departed, he to Thrace, but laughter-loving Aphrodite went to Paphos of"
4483,BOOK VIII.,"Cyprus, where is her precinct and fragrant altar. There the Graces"
4484,BOOK VIII.,"bathed and anointed her with oil imperishable, such as is laid upon the"
4485,BOOK VIII.,"everlasting gods. And they clad her in lovely raiment, a wonder to see."
4486,BOOK VIII.,
4487,BOOK VIII.,This was the song the famous minstrel sang; and Odysseus listened and
4488,BOOK VIII.,"was glad at heart, and likewise did the Phaeacians, of the long oars,"
4489,BOOK VIII.,those mariners renowned.
4490,BOOK VIII.,
4491,BOOK VIII.,"Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for none ever"
4492,BOOK VIII.,contended with them. So when they had taken in their hands the goodly
4493,BOOK VIII.,"ball of purple hue, that cunning Polybus had wrought for them, the one"
4494,BOOK VIII.,"would bend backwards, and throw it towards the shadowy clouds; and the"
4495,BOOK VIII.,"other would leap upward from the earth, and catch it lightly in his"
4496,BOOK VIII.,"turn, before his feet touched the ground. Now after they had made trial"
4497,BOOK VIII.,"of throwing the ball straight up, the twain set to dance upon the"
4498,BOOK VIII.,"bounteous earth, tossing the ball from hand to hand, and the other"
4499,BOOK VIII.,"youths stood by the lists and beat time, and a great din uprose."
4500,BOOK VIII.,
4501,BOOK VIII.,Then it was that goodly Odysseus spake unto Alcinous: “My lord
4502,BOOK VIII.,"Alcinous, most notable among all the people, thou didst boast thy"
4503,BOOK VIII.,"dancers to be the best in the world, and lo, thy words are fulfilled; I"
4504,BOOK VIII.,wonder as I look on them.”
4505,BOOK VIII.,
4506,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and the mighty king Alcinous rejoiced and spake at once"
4507,BOOK VIII.,"among the Phaeacians, masters of the oar:"
4508,BOOK VIII.,
4509,BOOK VIII.,"“Hearken ye, captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians, this stranger"
4510,BOOK VIII.,"seems to me a wise man enough. Come then, let us give him a stranger’s"
4511,BOOK VIII.,"gift, as is meet. Behold, there are twelve glorious princes who rule"
4512,BOOK VIII.,"among this people and bear sway, and I myself am the thirteenth. Now"
4513,BOOK VIII.,"each man among you bring a fresh robe and a doublet, and a talent of"
4514,BOOK VIII.,"fine gold, and let us speedily carry all these gifts together, that the"
4515,BOOK VIII.,"stranger may take them in his hands, and go to supper with a glad"
4516,BOOK VIII.,"heart. As for Euryalus, let him yield amends to the man himself, with"
4517,BOOK VIII.,"soft speech and with a gift, for his was no gentle saying.”"
4518,BOOK VIII.,
4519,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and they all assented thereto, and would have it so. And"
4520,BOOK VIII.,"each one sent forth his henchman to fetch his gift, and Euryalus"
4521,BOOK VIII.,"answered the king and spake, saying:"
4522,BOOK VIII.,
4523,BOOK VIII.,"“My lord Alcinous, most notable among all the people, I will make"
4524,BOOK VIII.,atonement to thy guest according to thy word. I will give him a hanger
4525,BOOK VIII.,"all of bronze, with a silver hilt thereto, and a sheath of fresh-sawn"
4526,BOOK VIII.,"ivory covers it about, and it shall be to him a thing of price.”"
4527,BOOK VIII.,
4528,BOOK VIII.,"Therewith he puts into his hands the hanger dight with silver, and"
4529,BOOK VIII.,"uttering his voice spake to him winged words: “Hail, stranger and"
4530,BOOK VIII.,"father; and if aught grievous hath been spoken, may the storm-winds"
4531,BOOK VIII.,soon snatch and bear it away. But may the gods grant thee to see thy
4532,BOOK VIII.,"wife and to come to thine own country, for all too long has thou"
4533,BOOK VIII.,endured affliction away from thy friends.”
4534,BOOK VIII.,
4535,BOOK VIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Thou too, my"
4536,BOOK VIII.,"friend, all hail; and may the gods vouchsafe thee happiness, and mayst"
4537,BOOK VIII.,"thou never miss this sword which thou hast given me, thou that with"
4538,BOOK VIII.,soft speech hast yielded me amends.”
4539,BOOK VIII.,
4540,BOOK VIII.,He spake and hung about his shoulders the silver-studded sword. And the
4541,BOOK VIII.,"sun sank, and the noble gifts were brought him. Then the proud henchmen"
4542,BOOK VIII.,"bare them to the palace of Alcinous, and the sons of noble Alcinous"
4543,BOOK VIII.,"took the fair gifts, and set them by their reverend mother. And the"
4544,BOOK VIII.,"mighty king Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat them down on"
4545,BOOK VIII.,the high seats. And the mighty Alcinous spake unto Arete:
4546,BOOK VIII.,
4547,BOOK VIII.,"“Bring me hither, my lady, a choice coffer, the best thou hast, and"
4548,BOOK VIII.,"thyself place therein a fresh robe and a doublet, and heat for our"
4549,BOOK VIII.,"guest a cauldron on the fire, and warm water, that after the bath the"
4550,BOOK VIII.,stranger may see all the gifts duly arrayed which the noble Phaeacians
4551,BOOK VIII.,"bare hither, and that he may have joy in the feast, and in hearing the"
4552,BOOK VIII.,song of the minstrelsy. Also I will give him a beautiful golden chalice
4553,BOOK VIII.,"of mine own, that he may be mindful of me all the days of his life when"
4554,BOOK VIII.,he poureth the drink-offering to Zeus and to the other gods.”
4555,BOOK VIII.,
4556,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great cauldron on"
4557,BOOK VIII.,the fire with what speed they might. And they set the cauldron for the
4558,BOOK VIII.,"filling of the bath on the blazing fire, and poured water therein, and"
4559,BOOK VIII.,took faggots and kindled them beneath. So the fire began to circle
4560,BOOK VIII.,"round the belly of the cauldron, and the water waxed hot. Meanwhile"
4561,BOOK VIII.,Arete brought forth for her guest the beautiful coffer from the
4562,BOOK VIII.,"treasure chamber, and bestowed fair gifts therein, raiment and gold,"
4563,BOOK VIII.,which the Phaeacians gave him. And with her own hands she placed
4564,BOOK VIII.,"therein a robe and goodly doublet, and uttering her voice spake to him"
4565,BOOK VIII.,winged words:
4566,BOOK VIII.,
4567,BOOK VIII.,"“Do thou now look to the lid, and quickly tie the knot, lest any man"
4568,BOOK VIII.,"spoil thy goods by the way, when presently thou fallest on sweet sleep"
4569,BOOK VIII.,travelling in thy black ship.”
4570,BOOK VIII.,
4571,BOOK VIII.,"Now when the steadfast goodly Odysseus heard this saying, forthwith he"
4572,BOOK VIII.,"fixed on the lid, and quickly tied the curious knot, which the lady"
4573,BOOK VIII.,Circe on a time had taught him. Then straightway the housewife bade him
4574,BOOK VIII.,"go to the bath and bathe him; and he saw the warm water and was glad,"
4575,BOOK VIII.,"for he was not wont to be so cared for, from the day that he left the"
4576,BOOK VIII.,"house of fair-tressed Calypso, but all that while he had comfort"
4577,BOOK VIII.,continually as a god.
4578,BOOK VIII.,
4579,BOOK VIII.,"Now after the maids had bathed him and anointed him with olive oil, and"
4580,BOOK VIII.,"had cast a fair mantle and a doublet upon him, he stept forth from the"
4581,BOOK VIII.,"bath, and went to be with the chiefs at their wine. And Nausicaa,"
4582,BOOK VIII.,"dowered with beauty by the gods, stood by the pillar of the"
4583,BOOK VIII.,"well-builded roof, and marvelled at Odysseus, beholding him before her"
4584,BOOK VIII.,"eyes, and she uttered her voice and spake to him winged words:"
4585,BOOK VIII.,
4586,BOOK VIII.,"“Farewell, stranger, and even in thine own country bethink thee of me"
4587,BOOK VIII.,"upon a time, for that to me first thou owest the ransom of life.”"
4588,BOOK VIII.,
4589,BOOK VIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Nausicaa, daughter"
4590,BOOK VIII.,"of great-hearted Alcinous, yea, may Zeus, the thunderer, the lord of"
4591,BOOK VIII.,"Here, grant me to reach my home and see the day of my returning; so"
4592,BOOK VIII.,"would I, even there, do thee worship as to a god, all my days for"
4593,BOOK VIII.,"evermore, for thou, lady, hast given me my life.”"
4594,BOOK VIII.,
4595,BOOK VIII.,He spake and sat him in the high seat by king Alcinous. And now they
4596,BOOK VIII.,were serving out the portions and mixing the wine. Then the henchmen
4597,BOOK VIII.,"drew nigh leading the sweet minstrel, Demodocus, that was had in honour"
4598,BOOK VIII.,"of the people. So he set him in the midst of the feasters, and made him"
4599,BOOK VIII.,lean against a tall column. Then to the henchman spake Odysseus of many
4600,BOOK VIII.,"counsels, for he had cut off a portion of the chine of a white-toothed"
4601,BOOK VIII.,"boar, whereon yet more was left, with rich fat on either side:"
4602,BOOK VIII.,
4603,BOOK VIII.,"“Lo, henchman, take this mess, and hand it to Demodocus, that he may"
4604,BOOK VIII.,"eat, and I will bid him hail, despite my sorrow. For minstrels from all"
4605,BOOK VIII.,men on earth get their meed of honour and worship; inasmuch as the Muse
4606,BOOK VIII.,"teacheth them the paths of song, and loveth the tribe of minstrels.”"
4607,BOOK VIII.,
4608,BOOK VIII.,"Thus he spake, and the henchman bare the mess, and set it upon the"
4609,BOOK VIII.,"knees of the lord Demodocus, and he took it, and was glad at heart."
4610,BOOK VIII.,Then they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set before
4611,BOOK VIII.,"them. Now after they had put from them the desire of meat and drink,"
4612,BOOK VIII.,"then Odysseus of many counsels spake to Demodocus, saying:"
4613,BOOK VIII.,
4614,BOOK VIII.,"“Demodocus, I praise thee far above all mortal men, whether it be the"
4615,BOOK VIII.,"Muse, the daughter of Zeus, that taught thee, or even Apollo, for right"
4616,BOOK VIII.,"duly dost thou chant the faring of the Achaeans, even all that they"
4617,BOOK VIII.,"wrought and suffered, and all their travail, as if, methinks, thou"
4618,BOOK VIII.,"hadst been present, or heard the tale from another. Come now, change"
4619,BOOK VIII.,"thy strain, and sing of the fashioning of the horse of wood, which"
4620,BOOK VIII.,"Epeius made by the aid of Athene, even the guileful thing, that goodly"
4621,BOOK VIII.,"Odysseus led up into the citadel, when he had laden it with the men who"
4622,BOOK VIII.,"wasted Ilios. If thou wilt indeed rehearse me this aright, so will I be"
4623,BOOK VIII.,"thy witness among all men, how the god of his grace hath given thee the"
4624,BOOK VIII.,gift of wondrous song.”
4625,BOOK VIII.,
4626,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and the minstrel, being stirred by the god, began and"
4627,BOOK VIII.,showed forth his minstrelsy. He took up the tale where it tells how the
4628,BOOK VIII.,"Argives of the one part set fire to their huts, and went aboard their"
4629,BOOK VIII.,"decked ships and sailed away, while those others, the fellowship of"
4630,BOOK VIII.,"renowned Odysseus, were now seated in the assembly-place of the"
4631,BOOK VIII.,"Trojans, all hidden in the horse, for the Trojans themselves had"
4632,BOOK VIII.,"dragged him to the citadel. So the horse stood there, while seated all"
4633,BOOK VIII.,around him the people spake many things confusedly and three ways their
4634,BOOK VIII.,counsel looked; either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless
4635,BOOK VIII.,"spear, or to drag it to the brow of the hill, and hurl it from the"
4636,BOOK VIII.,"rocks, or to leave it as a mighty offering to appease the gods. And on"
4637,BOOK VIII.,this wise it was to be at the last. For the doom was on them to perish
4638,BOOK VIII.,"when their city should have closed upon the great horse of wood,"
4639,BOOK VIII.,"wherein sat all the bravest of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans"
4640,BOOK VIII.,death and destiny. And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans poured
4641,BOOK VIII.,"forth from the horse, and left the hollow lair, and sacked the burg."
4642,BOOK VIII.,"And he sang how and where each man wasted the town, and of Odysseus,"
4643,BOOK VIII.,how he went like Ares to the house of Deiphobus with godlike Menelaus.
4644,BOOK VIII.,"It was there, he said, that Odysseus adventured the most grievous"
4645,BOOK VIII.,"battle, and in the end prevailed, by grace of great-hearted Athene."
4646,BOOK VIII.,
4647,BOOK VIII.,This was the song that the famous minstrel sang. But the heart of
4648,BOOK VIII.,"Odysseus melted, and the tear wet his cheeks beneath the eyelids. And"
4649,BOOK VIII.,"as a woman throws herself wailing about her dear lord, who hath fallen"
4650,BOOK VIII.,"before his city and the host, warding from his town and his children"
4651,BOOK VIII.,the pitiless day; and she beholds him dying and drawing difficult
4652,BOOK VIII.,"breath, and embracing his body wails aloud, while the foemen behind"
4653,BOOK VIII.,smite her with spears on back and shoulders and lead her up into
4654,BOOK VIII.,"bondage, to bear labour and trouble, and with the most pitiful grief"
4655,BOOK VIII.,her cheeks are wasted; even so pitifully fell the tears beneath the
4656,BOOK VIII.,brows of Odysseus. Now none of all the company marked him weeping; but
4657,BOOK VIII.,"Alcinous alone noted it, and was ware thereof, as he sat nigh him and"
4658,BOOK VIII.,heard him groaning heavily. And presently he spake among the
4659,BOOK VIII.,"Phaeacians, masters of the oar:"
4660,BOOK VIII.,
4661,BOOK VIII.,"“Hearken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and now let"
4662,BOOK VIII.,"Demodocus hold his hand from the loud lyre, for this song of his is"
4663,BOOK VIII.,"nowise pleasing alike to all. From the time that we began to sup, and"
4664,BOOK VIII.,"that the divine minstrel was moved to sing, ever since hath yonder"
4665,BOOK VIII.,"stranger never ceased from woeful lamentation: sore grief, methinks,"
4666,BOOK VIII.,"hath encompassed his heart. Nay, but let the minstrel cease, that we"
4667,BOOK VIII.,"may all alike make merry, hosts and guest, since it is far meeter so."
4668,BOOK VIII.,"For all these things are ready for the sake of the honourable stranger,"
4669,BOOK VIII.,even the convoy and the loving gifts which we give him out of our love.
4670,BOOK VIII.,"In a brother’s place stand the stranger and the suppliant, to him whose"
4671,BOOK VIII.,"wits have even a little range, wherefore do thou too hide not now with"
4672,BOOK VIII.,crafty purpose aught whereof I ask thee; it were more meet for thee to
4673,BOOK VIII.,"tell it out. Say, what is the name whereby they called thee at home,"
4674,BOOK VIII.,"even thy father and thy mother, and others thy townsmen and the"
4675,BOOK VIII.,"dwellers round about? For there is none of all mankind nameless,"
4676,BOOK VIII.,"neither the mean man nor yet the noble, from the first hour of his"
4677,BOOK VIII.,"birth, but parents bestow a name on every man so soon as he is born."
4678,BOOK VIII.,"Tell me too of thy land, thy township, and thy city, that our ships may"
4679,BOOK VIII.,conceive of their course to bring thee thither. For the Phaeacians have
4680,BOOK VIII.,"no pilots nor any rudders after the manner of other ships, but their"
4681,BOOK VIII.,barques themselves understand the thoughts and intents of men; they
4682,BOOK VIII.,"know the cities and fat fields of every people, and most swiftly they"
4683,BOOK VIII.,"traverse the gulf of the salt sea, shrouded in mist and cloud, and"
4684,BOOK VIII.,never do they go in fear of wreck or ruin. Howbeit I heard upon a time
4685,BOOK VIII.,"this word thus spoken by my father Nausithous, who was wont to say that"
4686,BOOK VIII.,Poseidon was jealous of us for that we give safe escort to all men. He
4687,BOOK VIII.,said that the god would some day smite a well-wrought ship of the
4688,BOOK VIII.,"Phaeacians as she came home from a convoy over the misty deep, and"
4689,BOOK VIII.,would overshadow our city with a great mountain. Thus that ancient one
4690,BOOK VIII.,"would speak, and thus the god may bring it about, or leave it undone,"
4691,BOOK VIII.,"according to the good pleasure of his will. But come now, declare me"
4692,BOOK VIII.,"this and plainly tell it all; whither wast thou borne wandering, and to"
4693,BOOK VIII.,what shores of men thou camest; tell me of the people and of their
4694,BOOK VIII.,"fair-lying cities, of those whoso are hard and wild and unjust, and of"
4695,BOOK VIII.,"those likewise who are hospitable and of a god-fearing mind. Declare,"
4696,BOOK VIII.,"too, wherefore thou dost weep and mourn in spirit at the tale of the"
4697,BOOK VIII.,faring of the Argive Danaans and the lay of Ilios. All this the gods
4698,BOOK VIII.,"have fashioned, and have woven the skein of death for men, that there"
4699,BOOK VIII.,might be a song in the ears even of the folk of aftertime. Hadst thou
4700,BOOK VIII.,"even a kinsman by marriage that fell before Ilios, a true man, a"
4701,BOOK VIII.,"daughter’s husband or wife’s father, such as are nearest us after those"
4702,BOOK VIII.,"of our own stock and blood? Or else, may be, some loving friend, a good"
4703,BOOK VIII.,man and true; for a friend with an understanding heart is no whit worse
4704,BOOK VIII.,than a brother.”
4705,BOOK VIII.,
4706,BOOK VIII.,
4707,BOOK VIII.,
4708,BOOK IX.,BOOK IX.
4709,BOOK IX.,
4710,BOOK IX.,
4711,BOOK IX.,"Odysseus relates, first, what befell him amongst the Cicones at"
4712,BOOK IX.,"Ismarus; secondly, amongst the Lotophagi; thirdly, how he was used by"
4713,BOOK IX.,the Cyclops Polyphemus.
4714,BOOK IX.,
4715,BOOK IX.,
4716,BOOK IX.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “King Alcinous, most"
4717,BOOK IX.,"notable of all the people, verily it is a good thing to list to a"
4718,BOOK IX.,"minstrel such as this one, like to the gods in voice. Nay, as for me, I"
4719,BOOK IX.,say that there is no more gracious or perfect delight than when a whole
4720,BOOK IX.,"people makes merry, and the men sit orderly at feast in the halls and"
4721,BOOK IX.,"listen to the singer, and the tables by them are laden with bread and"
4722,BOOK IX.,"flesh, and a wine-bearer drawing the wine serves it round and pours it"
4723,BOOK IX.,into the cups. This seems to me well-nigh the fairest thing in the
4724,BOOK IX.,"world. But now thy heart was inclined to ask of my grievous troubles,"
4725,BOOK IX.,that I may mourn for more exceeding sorrow. What then shall I tell of
4726,BOOK IX.,"first, what last, for the gods of heaven have given me woes in plenty?"
4727,BOOK IX.,"Now, first, will I tell my name, that ye too may know it, and that I,"
4728,BOOK IX.,"when I have escaped the pitiless day, may yet be your host, though my"
4729,BOOK IX.,"home is in a far country. I am ODYSSEUS, SON OF LAERTES, who am in"
4730,BOOK IX.,"men’s minds for all manner of wiles, and my fame reaches unto heaven."
4731,BOOK IX.,"And I dwell in clear-seen Ithaca, wherein is a mountain Neriton, with"
4732,BOOK IX.,"trembling forest leaves, standing manifest to view, and many islands"
4733,BOOK IX.,"lie around, very near one to the other, Dulichium and Same, and wooded"
4734,BOOK IX.,"Zacynthus. Now Ithaca lies low, furthest up the sea-line toward the"
4735,BOOK IX.,"darkness, but those others face the dawning and the sun: a rugged isle,"
4736,BOOK IX.,but a good nurse of noble youths; and for myself I can see nought
4737,BOOK IX.,"beside sweeter than a man’s own country. Verily Calypso, the fair"
4738,BOOK IX.,"goddess, would fain have kept me with her in her hollow caves, longing"
4739,BOOK IX.,"to have me for her lord; and likewise too, guileful Circe of Aia, would"
4740,BOOK IX.,"have stayed me in her halls, longing to have me for her lord. But never"
4741,BOOK IX.,did they prevail upon my heart within my breast. So surely is there
4742,BOOK IX.,"nought sweeter than a man’s own country and his parents, even though he"
4743,BOOK IX.,"dwell far off in a rich home, in a strange land, away from them that"
4744,BOOK IX.,"begat him. But come, let me tell thee too of the troubles of my"
4745,BOOK IX.,"journeying, which Zeus laid on me as I came from Troy."
4746,BOOK IX.,
4747,BOOK IX.,"“The wind that bare me from Ilios brought me nigh to the Cicones, even"
4748,BOOK IX.,"to Ismarus, whereupon I sacked their city and slew the people. And from"
4749,BOOK IX.,"out the city we took their wives and much substance, and divided them"
4750,BOOK IX.,"amongst us, that none through me might go lacking his proper share."
4751,BOOK IX.,"Howbeit, thereafter I commanded that we should flee with a swift foot,"
4752,BOOK IX.,but my men in their great folly hearkened not. There was much wine
4753,BOOK IX.,"still a drinking, and still they slew many flocks of sheep by the"
4754,BOOK IX.,seashore and kine with trailing feet and shambling gait. Meanwhile the
4755,BOOK IX.,"Cicones went and raised a cry to other Cicones their neighbours,"
4756,BOOK IX.,"dwelling inland, who were more in number than they and braver withal:"
4757,BOOK IX.,"skilled they were to fight with men from chariots, and when need was on"
4758,BOOK IX.,foot. So they gathered in the early morning as thick as leaves and
4759,BOOK IX.,flowers that spring in their season—yea and in that hour an evil doom
4760,BOOK IX.,"of Zeus stood by us, ill-fated men, that so we might be sore afflicted."
4761,BOOK IX.,"They set their battle in array by the swift ships, and the hosts cast"
4762,BOOK IX.,at one another with their bronze-shod spears. So long as it was morn
4763,BOOK IX.,"and the sacred day waxed stronger, so long we abode their assault and"
4764,BOOK IX.,"beat them off, albeit they outnumbered us. But when the sun was wending"
4765,BOOK IX.,"to the time of the loosing of cattle, then at last the Cicones drave in"
4766,BOOK IX.,"the Achaeans and overcame them, and six of my goodly-greaved company"
4767,BOOK IX.,perished from each ship: but the remnant of us escaped death and
4768,BOOK IX.,destiny.
4769,BOOK IX.,
4770,BOOK IX.,"“Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men saved from"
4771,BOOK IX.,"death, albeit we had lost our dear companions. Nor did my curved ships"
4772,BOOK IX.,move onward ere we had called thrice on each of those our hapless
4773,BOOK IX.,"fellows, who died at the hands of the Cicones on the plain. Now Zeus,"
4774,BOOK IX.,"gatherer of the clouds, aroused the North Wind against our ships with a"
4775,BOOK IX.,"terrible tempest, and covered land and sea alike with clouds, and down"
4776,BOOK IX.,"sped night from heaven. Thus the ships were driven headlong, and their"
4777,BOOK IX.,sails were torn to shreds by the might of the wind. So we lowered the
4778,BOOK IX.,"sails into the hold, in fear of death, but rowed the ships landward"
4779,BOOK IX.,"apace. There for two nights and two days we lay continually, consuming"
4780,BOOK IX.,our hearts with weariness and sorrow. But when the fair-tressed Dawn
4781,BOOK IX.,"had at last brought the full light of the third day, we set up the"
4782,BOOK IX.,"masts and hoisted the white sails and sat us down, while the wind and"
4783,BOOK IX.,the helmsman guided the ships. And now I should have come to mine own
4784,BOOK IX.,"country all unhurt, but the wave and the stream of the sea and the"
4785,BOOK IX.,"North Wind swept me from my course as I was doubling Malea, and drave"
4786,BOOK IX.,me wandering past Cythera.
4787,BOOK IX.,
4788,BOOK IX.,“Thence for nine whole days was I borne by ruinous winds over the
4789,BOOK IX.,teeming deep; but on the tenth day we set foot on the land of the
4790,BOOK IX.,"lotus-eaters, who eat a flowery food. So we stepped ashore and drew"
4791,BOOK IX.,"water, and straightway my company took their midday meal by the swift"
4792,BOOK IX.,ships. Now when we had tasted meat and drink I sent forth certain of my
4793,BOOK IX.,company to go and make search what manner of men they were who here
4794,BOOK IX.,"live upon the earth by bread, and I chose out two of my fellows, and"
4795,BOOK IX.,sent a third with them as herald. Then straightway they went and mixed
4796,BOOK IX.,"with the men of the lotus-eaters, and so it was that the lotus-eaters"
4797,BOOK IX.,"devised not death for our fellows, but gave them of the lotus to taste."
4798,BOOK IX.,"Now whosoever of them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, had"
4799,BOOK IX.,"no more wish to bring tidings nor to come back, but there he chose to"
4800,BOOK IX.,"abide with the lotus-eating men, ever feeding on the lotus, and"
4801,BOOK IX.,forgetful of his homeward way. Therefore I led them back to the ships
4802,BOOK IX.,"weeping, and sore against their will, and dragged them beneath the"
4803,BOOK IX.,"benches, and bound them in the hollow barques. But I commanded the rest"
4804,BOOK IX.,"of my well-loved company to make speed and go on board the swift ships,"
4805,BOOK IX.,lest haply any should eat of the lotus and be forgetful of returning.
4806,BOOK IX.,"Right soon they embarked, and sat upon the benches, and sitting orderly"
4807,BOOK IX.,they smote the grey sea water with their oars.
4808,BOOK IX.,
4809,BOOK IX.,“Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart. And we came to the land of
4810,BOOK IX.,"the Cyclôpes, a froward and a lawless folk, who trusting to the"
4811,BOOK IX.,"deathless gods plant not aught with their hands, neither plough: but,"
4812,BOOK IX.,"behold, all these things spring for them in plenty, unsown and"
4813,BOOK IX.,"untilled, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear great clusters of"
4814,BOOK IX.,"the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase. These"
4815,BOOK IX.,"have neither gatherings for council nor oracles of law, but they dwell"
4816,BOOK IX.,"in hollow caves on the crests of the high hills, and each one utters"
4817,BOOK IX.,"the law to his children and his wives, and they reck not one of"
4818,BOOK IX.,another.
4819,BOOK IX.,
4820,BOOK IX.,“Now there is a waste isle stretching without the harbour of the land
4821,BOOK IX.,"of the Cyclôpes, neither nigh at hand nor yet afar off, a woodland"
4822,BOOK IX.,"isle, wherein are wild goats unnumbered, for no path of men scares"
4823,BOOK IX.,"them, nor do hunters resort thither who suffer hardships in the wood,"
4824,BOOK IX.,as they range the mountain crests. Moreover it is possessed neither by
4825,BOOK IX.,"flocks nor by ploughed lands, but the soil lies unsown evermore and"
4826,BOOK IX.,"untilled, desolate of men, and feeds the bleating goats. For the"
4827,BOOK IX.,"Cyclôpes have by them no ships with vermilion cheek, not yet are there"
4828,BOOK IX.,"shipwrights in the island, who might fashion decked barques, which"
4829,BOOK IX.,"should accomplish all their desire, voyaging to the towns of men (as"
4830,BOOK IX.,"ofttimes men cross the sea to one another in ships), who might likewise"
4831,BOOK IX.,"have made of their isle a goodly settlement. Yea, it is in no wise a"
4832,BOOK IX.,"sorry land, but would bear all things in their season; for therein are"
4833,BOOK IX.,"soft water meadows by the shores of the grey salt sea, and there the"
4834,BOOK IX.,"vines know no decay, and the land is level to plough; thence might they"
4835,BOOK IX.,"reap a crop exceeding deep in due season, for verily there is fatness"
4836,BOOK IX.,"beneath the soil. Also there is a fair haven, where is no need of"
4837,BOOK IX.,"moorings, either to cast anchor or to fasten hawsers, but men may run"
4838,BOOK IX.,"the ship on the beach, and tarry until such time as the sailors are"
4839,BOOK IX.,"minded to be gone, and favourable breezes blow. Now at the head of the"
4840,BOOK IX.,"harbour is a well of bright water issuing from a cave, and round it are"
4841,BOOK IX.,"poplars growing. Thither we sailed, and some god guided us through the"
4842,BOOK IX.,"night, for it was dark and there was no light to see, a mist lying deep"
4843,BOOK IX.,"about the ships, nor did the moon show her light from heaven, but was"
4844,BOOK IX.,"shut in with clouds. No man then beheld that island, neither saw we the"
4845,BOOK IX.,"long waves rolling to the beach, till we had run our decked ships"
4846,BOOK IX.,"ashore. And when our ships were beached, we took down all their sails,"
4847,BOOK IX.,"and ourselves too stept forth upon the strand of the sea, and there we"
4848,BOOK IX.,fell into sound sleep and waited for the bright Dawn.
4849,BOOK IX.,
4850,BOOK IX.,"“So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, in wonder at the"
4851,BOOK IX.,"island we roamed over the length thereof: and the Nymphs, the daughters"
4852,BOOK IX.,"of Zeus, lord of the aegis, started the wild goats of the hills, that"
4853,BOOK IX.,my company might have wherewith to sup. Anon we took to us our curved
4854,BOOK IX.,"bows from out the ships and long spears, and arrayed in three bands we"
4855,BOOK IX.,began shooting at the goats; and the god soon gave us game in plenty.
4856,BOOK IX.,"Now twelve ships bare me company, and to each ship fell nine goats for"
4857,BOOK IX.,"a portion, but for me alone they set ten apart."
4858,BOOK IX.,
4859,BOOK IX.,"“Thus we sat there the livelong day until the going down of the sun,"
4860,BOOK IX.,feasting on abundant flesh and on sweet wine. For the red wine was not
4861,BOOK IX.,"yet spent from out the ships, but somewhat was yet therein, for we had"
4862,BOOK IX.,"each one drawn off large store thereof in jars, when we took the sacred"
4863,BOOK IX.,citadel of the Cicones. And we looked across to the land of the
4864,BOOK IX.,"Cyclôpes, who dwell nigh, and to the smoke, and to the voice of the"
4865,BOOK IX.,"men, and of the sheep and of the goats. And when the sun had sunk and"
4866,BOOK IX.,"darkness had come on, then we laid us to rest upon the sea-beach. So"
4867,BOOK IX.,"soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then I called a"
4868,BOOK IX.,"gathering of my men, and spake among them all:"
4869,BOOK IX.,
4870,BOOK IX.,"“‘Abide here all the rest of you, my dear companions; but I will go"
4871,BOOK IX.,"with mine own ship and my ship’s company, and make proof of these men,"
4872,BOOK IX.,"what manner of folk they are, whether froward, and wild, and unjust, or"
4873,BOOK IX.,hospitable and of god-fearing mind.’
4874,BOOK IX.,
4875,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and I climbed the ship’s side, and bade my company"
4876,BOOK IX.,"themselves to mount, and to loose the hawsers. So they soon embarked"
4877,BOOK IX.,"and sat upon the benches, and sitting orderly smote the grey sea water"
4878,BOOK IX.,"with their oars. Now when we had come to the land that lies hard by, we"
4879,BOOK IX.,"saw a cave on the border near to the sea, lofty and roofed over with"
4880,BOOK IX.,"laurels, and there many flocks of sheep and goats were used to rest."
4881,BOOK IX.,"And about it a high outer court was built with stones, deep bedded, and"
4882,BOOK IX.,with tall pines and oaks with their high crown of leaves. And a man was
4883,BOOK IX.,"wont to sleep therein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks"
4884,BOOK IX.,"alone and afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt apart in"
4885,BOOK IX.,"lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous thing and fashioned"
4886,BOOK IX.,"marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like"
4887,BOOK IX.,"a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone"
4888,BOOK IX.,from others.
4889,BOOK IX.,
4890,BOOK IX.,“Then I commanded the rest of my well-loved company to tarry there by
4891,BOOK IX.,"the ship, and to guard the ship, but I chose out twelve men, the best"
4892,BOOK IX.,"of my company, and sallied forth. Now I had with me a goat-skin of the"
4893,BOOK IX.,"dark wine and sweet which Maron, son of Euanthes, had given me, the"
4894,BOOK IX.,"priest of Apollo, the god that watched over Ismarus. And he gave it,"
4895,BOOK IX.,for that we had protected him with his wife and child reverently; for
4896,BOOK IX.,he dwelt in a thick grove of Phoebus Apollo. And he made me splendid
4897,BOOK IX.,"gifts; he gave me seven talents of gold well wrought, and he gave me a"
4898,BOOK IX.,"mixing bowl of pure silver, and furthermore wine which he drew off in"
4899,BOOK IX.,"twelve jars in all, sweet wine unmingled, a draught divine; nor did any"
4900,BOOK IX.,"of his servants or of his handmaids in the house know thereof, but"
4901,BOOK IX.,himself and his dear wife and one housedame only. And as often as they
4902,BOOK IX.,"drank that red wine honey sweet, he would fill one cup and pour it into"
4903,BOOK IX.,"twenty measures of water, and a marvellous sweet smell went up from the"
4904,BOOK IX.,mixing bowl: then truly it was no pleasure to refrain.
4905,BOOK IX.,
4906,BOOK IX.,"“With this wine I filled a great skin, and bare it with me, and corn"
4907,BOOK IX.,"too I put in a wallet, for my lordly spirit straightway had a boding"
4908,BOOK IX.,"that a man would come to me, a strange man, clothed in mighty strength,"
4909,BOOK IX.,one that knew not judgment and justice.[16]
4910,BOOK IX.,
4911,BOOK IX.,"[16] Literally, knowing neither dooms, nor ordinances of law."
4912,BOOK IX.,
4913,BOOK IX.,
4914,BOOK IX.,"“Soon we came to the cave, but we found him not within; he was"
4915,BOOK IX.,"shepherding his fat flocks in the pastures. So we went into the cave,"
4916,BOOK IX.,and gazed on all that was therein. The baskets were well laden with
4917,BOOK IX.,"cheeses, and the folds were thronged with lambs and kids; each kind was"
4918,BOOK IX.,"penned by itself, the firstlings apart, and the summer lambs apart,"
4919,BOOK IX.,apart too the younglings of the flock. Now all the vessels swam with
4920,BOOK IX.,"whey, the milk-pails and the bowls, the well-wrought vessels whereinto"
4921,BOOK IX.,he milked. My company then spake and besought me first of all to take
4922,BOOK IX.,"of the cheeses and to return, and afterwards to make haste and drive"
4923,BOOK IX.,"off the kids and lambs to the swift ships from out the pens, and to"
4924,BOOK IX.,sail over the salt sea water. Howbeit I hearkened not (and far better
4925,BOOK IX.,"would it have been), but waited to see the giant himself, and whether"
4926,BOOK IX.,he would give me gifts as a stranger’s due. Yet was not his coming to
4927,BOOK IX.,be with joy to my company.
4928,BOOK IX.,
4929,BOOK IX.,"“Then we kindled a fire, and made burnt-offering, and ourselves"
4930,BOOK IX.,"likewise took of the cheeses, and did eat, and sat waiting for him"
4931,BOOK IX.,"within till he came back, shepherding his flocks. And he bore a"
4932,BOOK IX.,"grievous weight of dry wood, against supper time. This log he cast down"
4933,BOOK IX.,"with a din inside the cave, and in fear we fled to the secret place of"
4934,BOOK IX.,"the rock. As for him, he drave his fat flocks into the wide cavern,"
4935,BOOK IX.,even all that he was wont to milk; but the males both of the sheep and
4936,BOOK IX.,of the goats he left without in the deep yard. Thereafter he lifted a
4937,BOOK IX.,"huge doorstone and weighty, and set it in the mouth of the cave, such"
4938,BOOK IX.,an one as two and twenty good four-wheeled wains could not raise from
4939,BOOK IX.,"the ground, so mighty a sheer rock did he set against the doorway. Then"
4940,BOOK IX.,"he sat down and milked the ewes and bleating goats, all orderly, and"
4941,BOOK IX.,beneath each ewe he placed her young. And anon he curdled one half of
4942,BOOK IX.,"the white milk, and massed it together, and stored it in"
4943,BOOK IX.,"wicker-baskets, and the other half he let stand in pails, that he might"
4944,BOOK IX.,have it to take and drink against supper time. Now when he had done all
4945,BOOK IX.,"his work busily, then he kindled the fire anew, and espied us, and made"
4946,BOOK IX.,question:
4947,BOOK IX.,
4948,BOOK IX.,"“‘Strangers, who are ye? Whence sail ye over the wet ways? On some"
4949,BOOK IX.,"trading enterprise or at adventure do ye rove, even as sea-robbers over"
4950,BOOK IX.,"the brine, for at hazard of their own lives they wander, bringing bale"
4951,BOOK IX.,to alien men.’
4952,BOOK IX.,
4953,BOOK IX.,"“So spake he, but as for us our heart within us was broken for terror"
4954,BOOK IX.,of the deep voice and his own monstrous shape; yet despite all I
4955,BOOK IX.,"answered and spake unto him, saying:"
4956,BOOK IX.,
4957,BOOK IX.,"“‘Lo, we are Achaeans, driven wandering from Troy, by all manner of"
4958,BOOK IX.,"winds over the great gulf of the sea; seeking our homes we fare, but"
4959,BOOK IX.,"another path have we come, by other ways: even such, methinks, was the"
4960,BOOK IX.,will and the counsel of Zeus. And we avow us to be the men of
4961,BOOK IX.,"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose fame is even now the mightiest under"
4962,BOOK IX.,"heaven, so great a city did he sack, and destroyed many people; but as"
4963,BOOK IX.,"for us we have lighted here, and come to these thy knees, if perchance"
4964,BOOK IX.,"thou wilt give us a stranger’s gift, or make any present, as is the due"
4965,BOOK IX.,"of strangers. Nay, lord, have regard to the gods, for we are thy"
4966,BOOK IX.,"suppliants; and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and sojourners, Zeus,"
4967,BOOK IX.,"the god of the stranger, who fareth in the company of reverend"
4968,BOOK IX.,strangers.’
4969,BOOK IX.,
4970,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and anon he answered out of his pitiless heart: ‘Thou art"
4971,BOOK IX.,"witless, my stranger, or thou hast come from afar, who biddest me"
4972,BOOK IX.,"either to fear or shun the gods. For the Cyclôpes pay no heed to Zeus,"
4973,BOOK IX.,"lord of the aegis, nor to the blessed gods, for verily we are better"
4974,BOOK IX.,"men than they. Nor would I, to shun the enmity of Zeus, spare either"
4975,BOOK IX.,"thee or thy company, unless my spirit bade me. But tell me where thou"
4976,BOOK IX.,didst stay thy well-wrought ship on thy coming? Was it perchance at the
4977,BOOK IX.,"far end of the island, or hard by, that I may know?’"
4978,BOOK IX.,
4979,BOOK IX.,"“So he spake tempting me, but he cheated me not, who knew full much,"
4980,BOOK IX.,and I answered him again with words of guile:
4981,BOOK IX.,
4982,BOOK IX.,"“‘As for my ship, Poseidon, the shaker of the earth, brake it to"
4983,BOOK IX.,"pieces, for he cast it upon the rocks at the border of your country,"
4984,BOOK IX.,"and brought it nigh the headland, and a wind bare it thither from the"
4985,BOOK IX.,sea. But I with these my men escaped from utter doom.’
4986,BOOK IX.,
4987,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and out of his pitiless heart he answered me not a word,"
4988,BOOK IX.,"but sprang up, and laid his hands upon my fellows, and clutching two"
4989,BOOK IX.,"together dashed them, as they had been whelps, to the earth, and the"
4990,BOOK IX.,"brain flowed forth upon the ground, and the earth was wet. Then cut he"
4991,BOOK IX.,"them up piecemeal, and made ready his supper. So he ate even as a"
4992,BOOK IX.,"mountain-bred lion, and ceased not, devouring entrails and flesh and"
4993,BOOK IX.,"bones with their marrow. And we wept and raised our hands to Zeus,"
4994,BOOK IX.,beholding the cruel deeds; and we were at our wits’ end. And after the
4995,BOOK IX.,Cyclops had filled his huge maw with human flesh and the milk he drank
4996,BOOK IX.,"thereafter, he lay within the cave, stretched out among his sheep."
4997,BOOK IX.,
4998,BOOK IX.,"“So I took counsel in my great heart, whether I should draw near, and"
4999,BOOK IX.,"pluck my sharp sword from my thigh, and stab him in the breast, where"
5000,BOOK IX.,"the midriff holds the liver, feeling for the place with my hand. But my"
5001,BOOK IX.,"second thought withheld me, for so should we too have perished even"
5002,BOOK IX.,there with utter doom. For we should not have prevailed to roll away
5003,BOOK IX.,with our hands from the lofty door the heavy stone which he set there.
5004,BOOK IX.,"So for that time we made moan, awaiting the bright Dawn."
5005,BOOK IX.,
5006,BOOK IX.,"“Now when early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, again he kindled"
5007,BOOK IX.,"the fire and milked his goodly flocks all orderly, and beneath each ewe"
5008,BOOK IX.,"set her lamb. Anon when he had done all his work busily, again he"
5009,BOOK IX.,seized yet other two men and made ready his mid-day meal. And after the
5010,BOOK IX.,"meal, lightly he moved away the great door-stone, and drave his fat"
5011,BOOK IX.,"flocks forth from the cave, and afterwards he set it in his place"
5012,BOOK IX.,"again, as one might set the lid on a quiver. Then with a loud whoop,"
5013,BOOK IX.,the Cyclops turned his fat flocks towards the hills; but I was left
5014,BOOK IX.,"devising evil in the deep of my heart, if in any wise I might avenge"
5015,BOOK IX.,"me, and Athene grant me renown."
5016,BOOK IX.,
5017,BOOK IX.,“And this was the counsel that showed best in my sight. There lay by a
5018,BOOK IX.,"sheep-fold a great club of the Cyclops, a club of olive wood, yet"
5019,BOOK IX.,"green, which he had cut to carry with him when it should be seasoned."
5020,BOOK IX.,Now when we saw it we likened it in size to the mast of a black ship of
5021,BOOK IX.,"twenty oars, a wide merchant vessel that traverses the great sea gulf,"
5022,BOOK IX.,so huge it was to view in bulk and length. I stood thereby and cut off
5023,BOOK IX.,"from it a portion as it were a fathom’s length, and set it by my"
5024,BOOK IX.,"fellows, and bade them fine it down, and they made it even, while I"
5025,BOOK IX.,"stood by and sharpened it to a point, and straightway I took it and"
5026,BOOK IX.,"hardened it in the bright fire. Then I laid it well away, and hid it"
5027,BOOK IX.,"beneath the dung, which was scattered in great heaps in the depths of"
5028,BOOK IX.,"the cave. And I bade my company cast lots among them, which of them"
5029,BOOK IX.,"should risk the adventure with me, and lift the bar and turn it about"
5030,BOOK IX.,"in his eye, when sweet sleep came upon him. And the lot fell upon those"
5031,BOOK IX.,"four whom I myself would have been fain to choose, and I appointed"
5032,BOOK IX.,myself to be the fifth among them. In the evening he came shepherding
5033,BOOK IX.,"his flocks of goodly fleece, and presently he drave his fat flocks into"
5034,BOOK IX.,"the cave each and all, nor left he any without in the deep court-yard,"
5035,BOOK IX.,"whether through some foreboding, or perchance that the god so bade him"
5036,BOOK IX.,do. Thereafter he lifted the huge door-stone and set it in the mouth of
5037,BOOK IX.,"the cave, and sitting down he milked the ewes and bleating goats, all"
5038,BOOK IX.,"orderly, and beneath each ewe he placed her young. Now when he had done"
5039,BOOK IX.,"all his work busily, again he seized yet other two and made ready his"
5040,BOOK IX.,"supper. Then I stood by the Cyclops and spake to him, holding in my"
5041,BOOK IX.,hands an ivy bowl of the dark wine:
5042,BOOK IX.,
5043,BOOK IX.,"“‘Cyclops, take and drink wine after thy feast of man’s meat, that thou"
5044,BOOK IX.,"mayest know what manner of drink this was that our ship held. And lo, I"
5045,BOOK IX.,"was bringing it thee as a drink offering, if haply thou mayest take"
5046,BOOK IX.,"pity and send me on my way home, but thy mad rage is past all"
5047,BOOK IX.,"sufferance. O hard of heart, how may another of the many men there be"
5048,BOOK IX.,"come ever to thee again, seeing that thy deeds have been lawless?’"
5049,BOOK IX.,
5050,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and he took the cup and drank it off, and found great"
5051,BOOK IX.,"delight in drinking the sweet draught, and asked me for it yet a second"
5052,BOOK IX.,time:
5053,BOOK IX.,
5054,BOOK IX.,"“‘Give it me again of thy grace, and tell me thy name straightway, that"
5055,BOOK IX.,"I may give thee a stranger’s gift, wherein thou mayest be glad. Yea for"
5056,BOOK IX.,"the earth, the grain-giver, bears for the Cyclôpes the mighty clusters"
5057,BOOK IX.,"of the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase,"
5058,BOOK IX.,but this is a rill of very nectar and ambrosia.’
5059,BOOK IX.,
5060,BOOK IX.,"“So he spake, and again I handed him the dark wine. Thrice I bare and"
5061,BOOK IX.,"gave it him, and thrice in his folly he drank it to the lees. Now when"
5062,BOOK IX.,"the wine had got about the wits of the Cyclops, then did I speak to him"
5063,BOOK IX.,with soft words:
5064,BOOK IX.,
5065,BOOK IX.,"“‘Cyclops, thou askest me my renowned name, and I will declare it unto"
5066,BOOK IX.,"thee, and do thou grant me a stranger’s gift, as thou didst promise."
5067,BOOK IX.,"Noman is my name, and Noman they call me, my father and my mother and"
5068,BOOK IX.,all my fellows.’
5069,BOOK IX.,
5070,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and straightway he answered me out of his pitiless heart:"
5071,BOOK IX.,
5072,BOOK IX.,"“‘Noman will I eat last in the number of his fellows, and the others"
5073,BOOK IX.,before him: that shall be thy gift.’
5074,BOOK IX.,
5075,BOOK IX.,"“Therewith he sank backwards and fell with face upturned, and there he"
5076,BOOK IX.,"lay with his great neck bent round, and sleep, that conquers all men,"
5077,BOOK IX.,overcame him. And the wine and the fragments of men’s flesh issued
5078,BOOK IX.,"forth from his mouth, and he vomited, being heavy with wine. Then I"
5079,BOOK IX.,"thrust in that stake under the deep ashes, until it should grow hot,"
5080,BOOK IX.,"and I spake to my companions comfortable words, lest any should hang"
5081,BOOK IX.,back from me in fear. But when that bar of olive wood was just about to
5082,BOOK IX.,"catch fire in the flame, green though it was, and began to glow"
5083,BOOK IX.,"terribly, even then I came nigh, and drew it from the coals, and my"
5084,BOOK IX.,"fellows gathered about me, and some god breathed great courage into us."
5085,BOOK IX.,"For their part they seized the bar of olive wood, that was sharpened at"
5086,BOOK IX.,"the point, and thrust it into his eye, while I from my place aloft"
5087,BOOK IX.,"turned it about, as when a man bores a ship’s beam with a drill while"
5088,BOOK IX.,"his fellows below spin it with a strap, which they hold at either end,"
5089,BOOK IX.,and the auger runs round continually. Even so did we seize the
5090,BOOK IX.,"fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood"
5091,BOOK IX.,flowed about the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his
5092,BOOK IX.,"eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the"
5093,BOOK IX.,roots thereof crackled in the flame. And as when a smith dips an axe or
5094,BOOK IX.,"adze in chill water with a great hissing, when he would temper it—for"
5095,BOOK IX.,hereby anon comes the strength of iron—even so did his eye hiss round
5096,BOOK IX.,"the stake of olive. And he raised a great and terrible cry, that the"
5097,BOOK IX.,"rock rang around, and we fled away in fear, while he plucked forth from"
5098,BOOK IX.,his eye the brand bedabbled in much blood. Then maddened with pain he
5099,BOOK IX.,"cast it from him with his hands, and called with a loud voice on the"
5100,BOOK IX.,"Cyclôpes, who dwelt about him in the caves along the windy heights. And"
5101,BOOK IX.,"they heard the cry and flocked together from every side, and gathering"
5102,BOOK IX.,round the cave asked him what ailed him:
5103,BOOK IX.,
5104,BOOK IX.,"“‘What hath so distressed thee, Polyphemus, that thou criest thus aloud"
5105,BOOK IX.,"through the immortal night, and makest us sleepless? Surely no mortal"
5106,BOOK IX.,driveth off thy flocks against thy will: surely none slayeth thyself by
5107,BOOK IX.,force or craft?’
5108,BOOK IX.,
5109,BOOK IX.,“And the strong Polyphemus spake to them again from out the cave: ‘My
5110,BOOK IX.,"friends, Noman is slaying me by guile, nor at all by force.’"
5111,BOOK IX.,
5112,BOOK IX.,“And they answered and spake winged words: ‘If then no man is violently
5113,BOOK IX.,"handling thee in thy solitude, it can in no wise be that thou shouldest"
5114,BOOK IX.,"escape the sickness sent by mighty Zeus. Nay, pray thou to thy father,"
5115,BOOK IX.,the lord Poseidon.’
5116,BOOK IX.,
5117,BOOK IX.,“On this wise they spake and departed; and my heart within me laughed
5118,BOOK IX.,to see how my name and cunning counsel had beguiled them. But the
5119,BOOK IX.,"Cyclops, groaning and travailing in pain, groped with his hands, and"
5120,BOOK IX.,"lifted away the stone from the door of the cave, and himself sat in the"
5121,BOOK IX.,"entry, with arms outstretched to catch, if he might, any one that was"
5122,BOOK IX.,"going forth with his sheep, so witless, methinks, did he hope to find"
5123,BOOK IX.,"me. But I advised me how all might be for the very best, if perchance I"
5124,BOOK IX.,"might find a way of escape from death for my companions and myself, and"
5125,BOOK IX.,"I wove all manner of craft and counsel, as a man will for his life,"
5126,BOOK IX.,seeing that great mischief was nigh. And this was the counsel that
5127,BOOK IX.,showed best in my sight. The rams of the flock were well nurtured and
5128,BOOK IX.,"thick of fleece, great and goodly, with wool dark as the violet."
5129,BOOK IX.,"Quietly I lashed them together with twisted withies, whereon the"
5130,BOOK IX.,"Cyclops slept, that lawless monster. Three together I took: now the"
5131,BOOK IX.,"middle one of the three would bear each a man, but the other twain went"
5132,BOOK IX.,"on either side, saving my fellows. Thus every three sheep bare their"
5133,BOOK IX.,man. But as for me I laid hold of the back of a young ram who was far
5134,BOOK IX.,"the best and the goodliest of all the flock, and curled beneath his"
5135,BOOK IX.,"shaggy belly there I lay, and so clung face upward, grasping the"
5136,BOOK IX.,wondrous fleece with a steadfast heart. So for that time making moan we
5137,BOOK IX.,awaited the bright Dawn.
5138,BOOK IX.,
5139,BOOK IX.,"“So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then did the"
5140,BOOK IX.,"rams of the flock hasten forth to pasture, but the ewes bleated"
5141,BOOK IX.,"unmilked about the pens, for their udders were swollen to bursting."
5142,BOOK IX.,"Then their lord, sore stricken with pain, felt along the backs of all"
5143,BOOK IX.,"the sheep as they stood up before him, and guessed not in his folly how"
5144,BOOK IX.,that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his thick-fleeced flocks.
5145,BOOK IX.,"Last of all the sheep came forth the ram, cumbered with his wool, and"
5146,BOOK IX.,the weight of me and my cunning. And the strong Polyphemus laid his
5147,BOOK IX.,hands on him and spake to him saying:
5148,BOOK IX.,
5149,BOOK IX.,"“‘Dear ram, wherefore, I pray thee, art thou the last of all the flocks"
5150,BOOK IX.,"to go forth from the cave, who of old wast not wont to lag behind the"
5151,BOOK IX.,"sheep, but wert ever the foremost to pluck the tender blossom of the"
5152,BOOK IX.,"pasture, faring with long strides, and wert still the first to come to"
5153,BOOK IX.,"the streams of the rivers, and first did long to return to the"
5154,BOOK IX.,homestead in the evening? But now art thou the very last. Surely thou
5155,BOOK IX.,"art sorrowing for the eye of thy lord, which an evil man blinded, with"
5156,BOOK IX.,"his accursed fellows, when he had subdued my wits with wine, even"
5157,BOOK IX.,"Noman, whom I say hath not yet escaped destruction. Ah, if thou couldst"
5158,BOOK IX.,"feel as I, and be endued with speech, to tell me where he shifts about"
5159,BOOK IX.,"to shun my wrath; then should he be smitten, and his brains be dashed"
5160,BOOK IX.,"against the floor here and there about the cave, and my heart be"
5161,BOOK IX.,"lightened of the sorrows which Noman, nothing worth, hath brought me!’"
5162,BOOK IX.,
5163,BOOK IX.,"“Therewith he sent the ram forth from him, and when we had gone but a"
5164,BOOK IX.,"little way from the cave and from the yard, first I loosed myself from"
5165,BOOK IX.,under the ram and then I set my fellows free. And swiftly we drave on
5166,BOOK IX.,"those stiff-shanked sheep, so rich in fat, and often turned to look"
5167,BOOK IX.,"about, till we came to the ship. And a glad sight to our fellows were"
5168,BOOK IX.,"we that had fled from death, but the others they would have bemoaned"
5169,BOOK IX.,"with tears; howbeit I suffered it not, but with frowning brows forbade"
5170,BOOK IX.,each man to weep. Rather I bade them to cast on board the many sheep
5171,BOOK IX.,"with goodly fleece, and to sail over the salt sea water. So they"
5172,BOOK IX.,"embarked forthwith, and sate upon the benches, and sitting orderly"
5173,BOOK IX.,smote the grey sea water with their oars. But when I had not gone so
5174,BOOK IX.,"far, but that a man’s shout might be heard, then I spoke unto the"
5175,BOOK IX.,Cyclops taunting him:
5176,BOOK IX.,
5177,BOOK IX.,"“‘Cyclops, so thou wert not to eat the company of a weakling by main"
5178,BOOK IX.,might in thy hollow cave! Thine evil deeds were very sure to find thee
5179,BOOK IX.,"out, thou cruel man, who hadst no shame to eat thy guests within thy"
5180,BOOK IX.,"gates, wherefore Zeus hath requited thee, and the other gods.’"
5181,BOOK IX.,
5182,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and he was mightily angered at heart, and he brake off the"
5183,BOOK IX.,"peak of a great hill and threw it at us, and it fell in front of the"
5184,BOOK IX.,"dark-prowed ship.[17] And the sea heaved beneath the fall of the rock,"
5185,BOOK IX.,and the backward flow of the wave bare the ship quickly to the dry
5186,BOOK IX.,"land, with the wash from the deep sea, and drave it to the shore. Then"
5187,BOOK IX.,"I caught up a long pole in my hands, and thrust the ship from off the"
5188,BOOK IX.,"land, and roused my company, and with a motion of the head bade them"
5189,BOOK IX.,"dash in with their oars, that so we might escape our evil plight. So"
5190,BOOK IX.,they bent to their oars and rowed on. But when we had now made twice
5191,BOOK IX.,"the distance over the brine, I would fain have spoken to the Cyclops,"
5192,BOOK IX.,"but my company stayed me on every side with soft words, saying:"
5193,BOOK IX.,
5194,BOOK IX.,"[17] We have omitted line 483, as required by the sense. It is"
5195,BOOK IX.,introduced here from line 540.
5196,BOOK IX.,
5197,BOOK IX.,
5198,BOOK IX.,"“‘Foolhardy that thou art, why wouldst thou rouse a wild man to wrath,"
5199,BOOK IX.,who even now hath cast so mighty a throw towards the deep and brought
5200,BOOK IX.,"our ship back to land, yea and we thought that we had perished[18] even"
5201,BOOK IX.,there? If he had heard any of us utter sound or speech he would have
5202,BOOK IX.,"crushed our heads and our ship timbers with a cast of a rugged stone,"
5203,BOOK IX.,so mightily he hurls.’
5204,BOOK IX.,
5205,BOOK IX.,[18] Neither in this passage nor in B ii. 171 nor in B xx. 121 do we
5206,BOOK IX.,think that the aorist infinitive after a verb of _saying_ can bear a
5207,BOOK IX.,"future sense. The aorist infinitive after ἐλπωρή (ii. 280, vii. 76) is"
5208,BOOK IX.,hardly an argument in its favour; the infinitive there is in fact a
5209,BOOK IX.,noun in the genitive case.
5210,BOOK IX.,
5211,BOOK IX.,
5212,BOOK IX.,"“So spake they, but they prevailed not on my lordly spirit, and I"
5213,BOOK IX.,answered him again from out an angry heart:
5214,BOOK IX.,
5215,BOOK IX.,"“‘Cyclops, if any one of mortal men shall ask thee of the unsightly"
5216,BOOK IX.,"blinding of thine eye, say that it was Odysseus that blinded it, the"
5217,BOOK IX.,"waster of cities, son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca.’"
5218,BOOK IX.,
5219,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and with a moan he answered me, saying:"
5220,BOOK IX.,
5221,BOOK IX.,"“‘Lo now, in very truth the ancient oracles have come upon me. There"
5222,BOOK IX.,"lived here a soothsayer, a noble man and a mighty, Telemus, son of"
5223,BOOK IX.,"Eurymus, who surpassed all men in soothsaying, and waxed old as a seer"
5224,BOOK IX.,among the Cyclôpes. He told me that all these things should come to
5225,BOOK IX.,"pass in the aftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight at the hand"
5226,BOOK IX.,of Odysseus. But I ever looked for some tall and goodly man to come
5227,BOOK IX.,"hither, clad in great might, but behold now one that is a dwarf, a man"
5228,BOOK IX.,"of no worth and a weakling, hath blinded me of my eye after subduing me"
5229,BOOK IX.,"with wine. Nay come hither, Odysseus, that I may set by thee a"
5230,BOOK IX.,"stranger’s cheer, and speed thy parting hence, that so the Earth-shaker"
5231,BOOK IX.,"may vouchsafe it thee, for his son am I, and he avows him for my"
5232,BOOK IX.,"father. And he himself will heal me, if it be his will; and none other"
5233,BOOK IX.,of the blessed gods or of mortal men.’
5234,BOOK IX.,
5235,BOOK IX.,"“Even so he spake, but I answered him, and said: ‘Would god that I were"
5236,BOOK IX.,"as sure to rob thee of soul and life, and send thee within the house of"
5237,BOOK IX.,"Hades, as I am that not even the Earth-shaker will heal thine eye!’"
5238,BOOK IX.,
5239,BOOK IX.,"“So I spake, and then he prayed to the lord Poseidon stretching forth"
5240,BOOK IX.,"his hands to the starry heaven: ‘Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the"
5241,BOOK IX.,"earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest"
5242,BOOK IX.,"thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus,"
5243,BOOK IX.,"waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet"
5244,BOOK IX.,if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded
5245,BOOK IX.,"house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the"
5246,BOOK IX.,"loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in"
5247,BOOK IX.,his house.’
5248,BOOK IX.,
5249,BOOK IX.,"“So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him. And"
5250,BOOK IX.,"once again he lifted a stone, far greater than the first, and with one"
5251,BOOK IX.,"swing he hurled it, and he put forth a measureless strength, and cast"
5252,BOOK IX.,"it but a little space behind the dark-prowed ship, and all but struck"
5253,BOOK IX.,"the end of the rudder. And the sea heaved beneath the fall of the rock,"
5254,BOOK IX.,but the wave bare on the ship and drave it to the further shore.
5255,BOOK IX.,
5256,BOOK IX.,"“But when he had now reached that island, where all our other decked"
5257,BOOK IX.,"ships abode together, and our company were gathered sorrowing,"
5258,BOOK IX.,"expecting us evermore, on our coming thither we ran our ship ashore"
5259,BOOK IX.,"upon the sand, and ourselves too stept forth upon the sea beach. Next"
5260,BOOK IX.,"we took forth the sheep of the Cyclops from out the hollow ship, and"
5261,BOOK IX.,"divided them, that none through me might go lacking his proper share."
5262,BOOK IX.,"But the ram for me alone my goodly-greaved company chose out, in the"
5263,BOOK IX.,"dividing of the sheep, and on the shore I offered him up to Zeus, even"
5264,BOOK IX.,"to the son of Cronos, who dwells in the dark clouds, and is lord of"
5265,BOOK IX.,"all, and I burnt the slices of the thighs. But he heeded not the"
5266,BOOK IX.,"sacrifice, but was devising how my decked ships and my dear company"
5267,BOOK IX.,"might perish utterly. Thus for that time we sat the livelong day, until"
5268,BOOK IX.,"the going down of the sun, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine."
5269,BOOK IX.,"And when the sun had sunk and darkness had come on, then we laid us to"
5270,BOOK IX.,"rest upon the sea beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the"
5271,BOOK IX.,"rosy-fingered, I called to my company, and commanded them that they"
5272,BOOK IX.,should themselves climb the ship and loose the hawsers. So they soon
5273,BOOK IX.,"embarked and sat upon the benches, and sitting orderly smote the grey"
5274,BOOK IX.,sea water with their oars.
5275,BOOK IX.,
5276,BOOK IX.,"“Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men saved from"
5277,BOOK IX.,"death, albeit we had lost our dear companions."

5287,BOOK X.,"Odysseus, his entertainment by Aeolus, of whom he received a fair wind"
5288,BOOK X.,"for the present, and all the rest of the winds tied up in a bag; which"
5289,BOOK X.,"his men untying, flew out, and carried him back to Aeolus, who refused"
5290,BOOK X.,"to receive him. His adventure at Laestrygonia with Antiphates, where of"
5291,BOOK X.,"twelve ships he lost eleven, men and all. How he went thence to the"
5292,BOOK X.,"Isle of Aea, where half of his men were turned by Circe into swine, and"
5293,BOOK X.,"how he went himself, and by the help of Hermes recovered them and"

5297,BOOK X.,"“Then we came to the isle Aeolian, where dwelt Aeolus, son of Hippotas,"
5298,BOOK X.,"dear too the deathless gods, in a floating island, and all about it is"
5299,BOOK X.,"a wall of bronze unbroken, and the cliff runs up sheer from the sea."
5300,BOOK X.,"His twelve children to abide there in his halls, six daughters and six"
5301,BOOK X.,"lusty sons; and, behold, he gave his daughters to his sons to wife. And"
5302,BOOK X.,"they feast evermore by their dear father and their kind mother, and"
5303,BOOK X.,dainties innumerable lie ready to their hands. And the house is full of
5304,BOOK X.,"the savour of feasting, and the noise thereof rings round, yea in the"
5305,BOOK X.,"courtyard, by day, and in the night they sleep each one by his chaste"
5306,BOOK X.,wife in coverlets and on jointed bedsteads. So then we came to their
5307,BOOK X.,"city and their goodly dwelling, and the king entreated me kindly for a"
5308,BOOK X.,"whole month, and sought out each thing, Ilios and the ships of the"
5309,BOOK X.,"Argives, and the return of the Achaeans. So I told him all the tale in"
5310,BOOK X.,"order duly. But when I in turn took the word and asked of my journey,"
5311,BOOK X.,"and bade him send me on my way, he too denied me not, but furnished an"
5312,BOOK X.,"escort. He gave me a wallet, made of the hide of an ox of nine seasons"
5313,BOOK X.,"old, which he let flay, and therein he bound the ways of all the noisy"
5314,BOOK X.,"winds; for him the son of Cronos made keeper of the winds, either to"
5315,BOOK X.,lull or to rouse what blasts he will. And he made it fast in the hold
5316,BOOK X.,"of the ship with a shining silver thong, that not the faintest breath"
5317,BOOK X.,might escape. Then he sent forth the blast of the West Wind to blow for
5318,BOOK X.,"me, to bear our ships and ourselves upon our way; but this he was never"
5319,BOOK X.,"to bring to pass, for we were undone through our own heedlessness."
5320,BOOK X.,
5321,BOOK X.,"“For nine whole days we sailed by night and day continually, and now on"
5322,BOOK X.,"the tenth day my native land came in sight, and already we were so near"
5323,BOOK X.,that we beheld the folk tending the beacon fires. Then over me there
5324,BOOK X.,"came sweet slumber in my weariness, for all the time I was holding the"
5325,BOOK X.,"sheet, nor gave it to any of my company, that so we might come quicker"
5326,BOOK X.,"to our own country. Meanwhile my company held converse together, and"
5327,BOOK X.,"said that I was bringing home for myself gold and silver, gifts from"
5328,BOOK X.,Aeolus the high-hearted son of Hippotas. And thus would they speak
5329,BOOK X.,looking each man to his neighbour:
5330,BOOK X.,
5331,BOOK X.,"“‘Lo now, how beloved he is and highly esteemed among all men, to the"
5332,BOOK X.,city and land of whomsoever he may come. Many are the goodly treasures
5333,BOOK X.,"he taketh with him out of the spoil from Troy, while we who have"
5334,BOOK X.,fulfilled like journeying with him return homeward bringing with us but
5335,BOOK X.,empty hands. And now Aeolus hath given unto him these things freely in
5336,BOOK X.,"his love. Nay come, let us quickly see what they are, even what wealth"
5337,BOOK X.,of gold and silver is in the wallet.’
5338,BOOK X.,
5339,BOOK X.,"“So they spake, and the evil counsel of my company prevailed. They"
5340,BOOK X.,"loosed the wallet, and all the winds brake forth. And the violent blast"
5341,BOOK X.,"seized my men, and bare them towards the high seas weeping, away from"
5342,BOOK X.,"their own country; but as for me, I awoke and communed with my great"
5343,BOOK X.,"heart, whether I should cast myself from the ship and perish in the"
5344,BOOK X.,"deep, or endure in silence and abide yet among the living. Howbeit I"
5345,BOOK X.,"hardened my heart to endure, and muffling my head I lay still in the"
5346,BOOK X.,ship. But the vessels were driven by the evil storm-wind back to the
5347,BOOK X.,"isle Aeolian, and my company made moan."
5348,BOOK X.,
5349,BOOK X.,"“There we stepped ashore and drew water, and my company presently took"
5350,BOOK X.,their midday meal by the swift ships. Now when we had tasted bread and
5351,BOOK X.,"wine, I took with me a herald and one of my company, and went to the"
5352,BOOK X.,famous dwelling of Aeolus: and I found him feasting with his wife and
5353,BOOK X.,children. So we went in and sat by the pillars of the door on the
5354,BOOK X.,"threshold, and they all marvelled and asked us:"
5355,BOOK X.,
5356,BOOK X.,"“‘How hast thou come hither, Odysseus? What evil god assailed thee?"
5357,BOOK X.,"Surely we sent thee on thy way with all diligence, that thou mightest"
5358,BOOK X.,"get thee to thine own country and thy home, and whithersoever thou"
5359,BOOK X.,wouldest.’
5360,BOOK X.,
5361,BOOK X.,"“Even so they said, but I spake among them heavy at heart: ‘My evil"
5362,BOOK X.,"company hath been my bane, and sleep thereto remorseless. Come, my"
5363,BOOK X.,"friends, do ye heal the harm, for yours is the power.’"
5364,BOOK X.,
5365,BOOK X.,"“So I spake, beseeching them in soft words, but they held their peace."
5366,BOOK X.,"And the father answered, saying: ‘Get thee forth from the island"
5367,BOOK X.,"straightway, thou that art the most reprobate of living men. Far be it"
5368,BOOK X.,from me to help or to further that man whom the blessed gods abhor! Get
5369,BOOK X.,"thee forth, for lo, thy coming marks thee hated by the deathless gods.’"
5370,BOOK X.,
5371,BOOK X.,“Therewith he sent me forth from the house making heavy moan. Thence we
5372,BOOK X.,sailed onwards stricken at heart. And the spirit of the men was spent
5373,BOOK X.,"beneath the grievous rowing by reason of our vain endeavour, for there"
5374,BOOK X.,was no more any sign of a wafting wind. So for the space of six days we
5375,BOOK X.,"sailed by night and day continually, and on the seventh we came to the"
5376,BOOK X.,"steep stronghold of Lamos, Telepylos of the Laestrygons, where herdsman"
5377,BOOK X.,"hails herdsman as he drives in his flock, and the other who drives"
5378,BOOK X.,forth answers the call. There might a sleepless man have earned a
5379,BOOK X.,"double wage, the one as neat-herd, the other shepherding white flocks:"
5380,BOOK X.,so near are the outgoings of the night and of the day. Thither when he
5381,BOOK X.,"had come to the fair haven, whereabout on both sides goes one steep"
5382,BOOK X.,cliff unbroken and jutting headlands over against each other stretch
5383,BOOK X.,"forth at the mouth of the harbour, and strait is the entrance;"
5384,BOOK X.,thereinto all the others steered their curved ships. Now the vessels
5385,BOOK X.,"were bound within the hollow harbour each hard by other, for no wave"
5386,BOOK X.,"ever swelled within it, great or small, but there was a bright calm all"
5387,BOOK X.,"around. But I alone moored my dark ship without the harbour, at the"
5388,BOOK X.,"uttermost point thereof, and made fast the hawser to a rock. And I went"
5389,BOOK X.,"up a craggy hill, a place of out-look, and stood thereon: thence there"
5390,BOOK X.,"was no sign of the labour of men or oxen, only we saw the smoke curling"
5391,BOOK X.,upward from the land. Then I sent forth certain of my company to go and
5392,BOOK X.,search out what manner of men they were who here live upon the earth by
5393,BOOK X.,"bread, choosing out two of my company and sending a third with them as"
5394,BOOK X.,"herald. Now when they had gone ashore, they went along a level road"
5395,BOOK X.,whereby wains were wont to draw down wood from the high hills to the
5396,BOOK X.,"town. And without the town they fell in with a damsel drawing water,"
5397,BOOK X.,the noble daughter of Laestrygonian Antiphates. She had come down to
5398,BOOK X.,"the clear-flowing spring Artacia, for thence it was custom to draw"
5399,BOOK X.,"water to the town. So they stood by her and spake unto her, and asked"
5400,BOOK X.,"who was king of that land, and who they were he ruled over. Then at"
5401,BOOK X.,once she showed them the high-roofed hall of her father. Now when they
5402,BOOK X.,"had entered the renowned house, they found his wife therein: she was"
5403,BOOK X.,huge of bulk as a mountain peak and was loathly in their sight.
5404,BOOK X.,"Straightway she called the renowned Antiphates, her lord, from the"
5405,BOOK X.,"assembly-place, and he contrived a pitiful destruction for my men."
5406,BOOK X.,Forthwith he clutched up one of my company and made ready his midday
5407,BOOK X.,"meal, but the other twain sprang up and came in flight to the ships."
5408,BOOK X.,"Then he raised the war cry through the town, and the valiant"
5409,BOOK X.,"Laestrygons at the sound thereof, flocked together from every side, a"
5410,BOOK X.,"host past number, not like men but like the Giants. They cast at us"
5411,BOOK X.,"from the cliffs with great rocks, each of them a man’s burden, and anon"
5412,BOOK X.,there arose from the fleet an evil din of men dying and ships shattered
5413,BOOK X.,withal. And like folk spearing fishes they bare home their hideous
5414,BOOK X.,meal. While as yet they were slaying my friends within the deep
5415,BOOK X.,"harbour, I drew my sharp sword from my thigh, and with it cut the"
5416,BOOK X.,"hawsers of my dark-prowed ship. Quickly then I called to my company,"
5417,BOOK X.,"and bade them dash in with the oars, that we might clean escape this"
5418,BOOK X.,evil plight. And all with one accord they tossed the sea water with the
5419,BOOK X.,"oar-blade, in dread of death, and to my delight my barque flew forth to"
5420,BOOK X.,"the high seas away from the beetling rocks, but those other ships were"
5421,BOOK X.,"lost there, one and all."
5422,BOOK X.,
5423,BOOK X.,"“Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men saved from"
5424,BOOK X.,"death, albeit we had lost our dear companions. And we came to the isle"
5425,BOOK X.,"Aeaean, where dwelt Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of"
5426,BOOK X.,"mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Aeetes. Both were begotten of"
5427,BOOK X.,"Helios, who gives light to all men, and their mother was Perse,"
5428,BOOK X.,daughter of Oceanus. There on the shore we put in with our ship into
5429,BOOK X.,"the sheltering haven silently, and some god was our guide. Then we"
5430,BOOK X.,"stept ashore, and for two days and two nights lay there, consuming our"
5431,BOOK X.,own hearts for weariness and pain. But when now the fair-tressed Dawn
5432,BOOK X.,"had brought the full light of the third day, then did I seize my spear"
5433,BOOK X.,"and my sharp sword, and quickly departing from the ship I went up unto"
5434,BOOK X.,"a place of wide prospect, if haply I might see any sign of the labour"
5435,BOOK X.,"of men and hear the sound of their speech. So I went up a craggy hill,"
5436,BOOK X.,"a place of out-look, and I saw the smoke rising from the broad-wayed"
5437,BOOK X.,"earth in the halls of Circe, through the thick coppice and the"
5438,BOOK X.,woodland. Then I mused in my mind and heart whether I should go and
5439,BOOK X.,"make discovery, for that I had seen the smoke and flame. And as I"
5440,BOOK X.,"thought thereon this seemed to me the better counsel, to go first to"
5441,BOOK X.,"the swift ship and to the sea-banks, and give my company their midday"
5442,BOOK X.,"meal, and then send them to make search. But as I came and drew nigh to"
5443,BOOK X.,"the curved ship, some god even then took pity on me in my loneliness,"
5444,BOOK X.,and sent a tall antlered stag across my very path. He was coming down
5445,BOOK X.,"from his pasture in the woodland to the river to drink, for verily the"
5446,BOOK X.,might of the sun was sore upon him. And as he came up from out of the
5447,BOOK X.,"stream, I smote him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the"
5448,BOOK X.,"brazen shaft went clean through him, and with a moan he fell in the"
5449,BOOK X.,"dust, and his life passed from him. Then I set my foot on him and drew"
5450,BOOK X.,"forth the brazen shaft from the wound, and laid it hard by upon the"
5451,BOOK X.,"ground and let it lie. Next I broke withies and willow twigs, and wove"
5452,BOOK X.,"me a rope a fathom in length, well twisted from end to end, and bound"
5453,BOOK X.,"together the feet of the huge beast, and went to the black ship bearing"
5454,BOOK X.,"him across my neck, and leaning on a spear, for it was in no wise"
5455,BOOK X.,"possible to carry him on my shoulder with the one hand, for he was a"
5456,BOOK X.,mighty quarry. And I threw him down before the ship and roused my
5457,BOOK X.,"company with soft words, standing by each man in turn:"
5458,BOOK X.,
5459,BOOK X.,"“‘Friends, for all our sorrows we shall not yet a while go down to the"
5460,BOOK X.,"house of Hades, ere the coming of the day of destiny; go to then, while"
5461,BOOK X.,"as yet there is meat and drink in the swift ship, let us take thought"
5462,BOOK X.,"thereof, that we be not famished for hunger.’"
5463,BOOK X.,
5464,BOOK X.,"“Even so I spake, and they speedily hearkened to my words. They"
5465,BOOK X.,"unmuffled their heads, and there on the shore of the unharvested sea"
5466,BOOK X.,"gazed at the stag, for he was a mighty quarry. But after they had"
5467,BOOK X.,"delighted their eyes with the sight of him, they washed their hands and"
5468,BOOK X.,got ready the glorious feast. So for that time we sat the livelong day
5469,BOOK X.,"till the going down of the sun, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet"
5470,BOOK X.,"wine. But when the sun sank and darkness had come on, then we laid us"
5471,BOOK X.,"to rest upon the sea beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the"
5472,BOOK X.,"rosy-fingered, I called a gathering of my men and spake in the ears of"
5473,BOOK X.,them all:
5474,BOOK X.,
5475,BOOK X.,"“‘Hear my works, my fellows, despite your evil case. My friends, lo,"
5476,BOOK X.,"now we know not where is the place of darkness or of dawning, nor where"
5477,BOOK X.,"the Sun, that gives light to men, goes beneath the earth, nor where he"
5478,BOOK X.,rises; therefore let us advise us speedily if any counsel yet may be:
5479,BOOK X.,"as for me, I deem there is none. For I went up a craggy hill, a place"
5480,BOOK X.,"of out-look, and saw the island crowned about with the circle of the"
5481,BOOK X.,"endless sea, the isle itself lying low; and in the midst thereof mine"
5482,BOOK X.,eyes beheld the smoke through the thick coppice and the woodland.’
5483,BOOK X.,
5484,BOOK X.,"“Even so I spake, but their spirit within them was broken, as they"
5485,BOOK X.,"remembered the deeds of Antiphates the Laestrygonian, and all the evil"
5486,BOOK X.,"violence of the haughty Cyclops, the man-eater. So they wept aloud"
5487,BOOK X.,shedding big tears. Howbeit no avail came of their weeping.
5488,BOOK X.,
5489,BOOK X.,"“Then I numbered my goodly-greaved company in two bands, and appointed"
5490,BOOK X.,"a leader for each, and I myself took the command of the one part, and"
5491,BOOK X.,godlike Eurylochus of the other. And anon we shook the lots in a
5492,BOOK X.,"brazen-fitted helmet, and out leapt the lot of proud Eurylochus. So he"
5493,BOOK X.,"went on his way, and with him two and twenty of my fellowship all"
5494,BOOK X.,weeping; and we were left behind making lament. In the forest glades
5495,BOOK X.,"they found the halls of Circe builded, of polished stone, in a place"
5496,BOOK X.,with wide prospect. And all around the palace mountain-bred wolves and
5497,BOOK X.,"lions were roaming, whom she herself had bewitched with evil drugs that"
5498,BOOK X.,"she gave them. Yet the beasts did not set on my men, but lo, they"
5499,BOOK X.,"ramped about them and fawned on them, wagging their long tails. And as"
5500,BOOK X.,"when dogs fawn about their lord when he comes from the feast, for he"
5501,BOOK X.,"always brings them the fragments that soothe their mood, even so the"
5502,BOOK X.,strong-clawed wolves and the lions fawned around them; but they were
5503,BOOK X.,affrighted when they saw the strange and terrible creatures. So they
5504,BOOK X.,"stood at the outer gate of the fair-tressed goddess, and within they"
5505,BOOK X.,"heard Circe singing in a sweet voice, as she fared to and fro before"
5506,BOOK X.,"the great web imperishable, such as is the handiwork of goddesses, fine"
5507,BOOK X.,"of woof and full of grace and splendour. Then Polites, a leader of men,"
5508,BOOK X.,"the dearest to me and the trustiest of all my company, first spake to"
5509,BOOK X.,them:
5510,BOOK X.,
5511,BOOK X.,"“‘Friends, forasmuch as there is one within that fares to and fro"
5512,BOOK X.,"before a mighty web singing a sweet song, so that all the floor of the"
5513,BOOK X.,"hall makes echo, a goddess she is or a woman; come quickly and cry"
5514,BOOK X.,aloud to her.’
5515,BOOK X.,
5516,BOOK X.,“He spake the word and they cried aloud and called to her. And
5517,BOOK X.,straightway she came forth and opened the shining doors and bade them
5518,BOOK X.,"in, and all went with her in their heedlessness. But Eurylochus tarried"
5519,BOOK X.,"behind, for he guessed that there was some treason. So she led them in"
5520,BOOK X.,"and set them upon chairs and high seats, and made them a mess of cheese"
5521,BOOK X.,"and barley-meal and yellow honey with Pramnian wine, and mixed harmful"
5522,BOOK X.,drugs with the food to make them utterly forget their own country. Now
5523,BOOK X.,"when she had given them the cup and they had drunk it off, presently"
5524,BOOK X.,"she smote them with a wand, and in the styes of the swine she penned"
5525,BOOK X.,"them. So they had the head and voice, the bristles and the shape of"
5526,BOOK X.,"swine, but their mind abode even as of old. Thus were they penned there"
5527,BOOK X.,"weeping, and Circe flung them acorns and mast and fruit of the cornel"
5528,BOOK X.,"tree to eat, whereon wallowing swine do always batten."
5529,BOOK X.,
5530,BOOK X.,“Now Eurylochus came back to the swift black ship to bring tidings of
5531,BOOK X.,"his fellows, and of their unseemly doom. Not a word could he utter, for"
5532,BOOK X.,"all his desire, so deeply smitten was he to the heart with grief, and"
5533,BOOK X.,his eyes were filled with tears and his soul was fain of lamentation.
5534,BOOK X.,"But when we all had pressed him with our questions in amazement, even"
5535,BOOK X.,then he told the fate of the remnant of our company.
5536,BOOK X.,
5537,BOOK X.,"“‘We went, as thou didst command, through the coppice, noble Odysseus:"
5538,BOOK X.,"we found within the forest glades the fair halls, builded of polished"
5539,BOOK X.,"stone, in a place with wide prospect. And there was one that fared"
5540,BOOK X.,"before a mighty web and sang a clear song, a goddess she was or a"
5541,BOOK X.,"woman, and they cried aloud and called to her. And straightway she came"
5542,BOOK X.,"forth, and opened the shining doors and bade them in, and they all went"
5543,BOOK X.,"with her in their heedlessness. But I tarried behind, for I guessed"
5544,BOOK X.,"that there was some treason. Then they vanished away one and all, nor"
5545,BOOK X.,"did any of them appear again, though I sat long time watching.’"
5546,BOOK X.,
5547,BOOK X.,"“So spake he, whereon I cast about my shoulder my silver-studded sword,"
5548,BOOK X.,"a great blade of bronze, and slung my bow about me and bade him lead me"
5549,BOOK X.,"again by the way that he came. But he caught me with both hands, and by"
5550,BOOK X.,"my knees he besought me, and bewailing him spake to me winged words:"
5551,BOOK X.,
5552,BOOK X.,"“‘Lead me not thither against my will, oh fosterling of Zeus, but leave"
5553,BOOK X.,"me here! For well I know thou shalt thyself return no more, nor bring"
5554,BOOK X.,"any one of all thy fellowship; nay, let us flee the swifter with those"
5555,BOOK X.,"that be here, for even yet may we escape the evil day.’"
5556,BOOK X.,
5557,BOOK X.,"“On this wise he spake, but I answered him, saying: ‘Eurylochus, abide"
5558,BOOK X.,"for thy part here in this place, eating and drinking by the black"
5559,BOOK X.,"hollow ship: but I will go forth, for a strong constraint is laid on"
5560,BOOK X.,me.’
5561,BOOK X.,
5562,BOOK X.,"“With that I went up from the ship and the sea-shore. But lo, when in"
5563,BOOK X.,my faring through the sacred glades I was now drawing near to the great
5564,BOOK X.,"hall of the enchantress Circe, then did Hermes, of the golden wand,"
5565,BOOK X.,"meet me as I approached the house, in the likeness of a young man with"
5566,BOOK X.,"the first down on his lip, the time when youth is most gracious. So he"
5567,BOOK X.,clasped my hand and spake and hailed me:
5568,BOOK X.,
5569,BOOK X.,"“‘Ah, hapless man, whither away again, all alone through the wolds,"
5570,BOOK X.,thou that knowest not this country? And thy company yonder in the hall
5571,BOOK X.,"of Circe are penned in the guise of swine, in their deep lairs abiding."
5572,BOOK X.,"Is it in hope to free them that thou art come hither? Nay, methinks,"
5573,BOOK X.,thou thyself shalt never return but remain there with the others. Come
5574,BOOK X.,"then, I will redeem thee from thy distress, and bring deliverance. Lo,"
5575,BOOK X.,"take this herb of virtue, and go to the dwelling of Circe, that it may"
5576,BOOK X.,keep from thy head the evil day. And I will tell thee all the magic
5577,BOOK X.,sleight of Circe. She will mix thee a potion and cast drugs into the
5578,BOOK X.,mess; but not even so shall she be able to enchant thee; so helpful is
5579,BOOK X.,"this charmed herb that I shall give thee, and I will tell thee all."
5580,BOOK X.,"When it shall be that Circe smites thee with her long wand, even then"
5581,BOOK X.,"draw thou thy sharp sword from thy thigh, and spring on her, as one"
5582,BOOK X.,eager to slay her. And she will shrink away and be instant with thee to
5583,BOOK X.,"lie with her. Thenceforth disdain not thou the bed of the goddess, that"
5584,BOOK X.,she may deliver thy company and kindly entertain thee. But command her
5585,BOOK X.,"to swear a mighty oath by the blessed gods, that she will plan nought"
5586,BOOK X.,"else of mischief to thine own hurt, lest she make thee a dastard and"
5587,BOOK X.,"unmanned, when she hath thee naked.’"
5588,BOOK X.,
5589,BOOK X.,“Therewith the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had plucked
5590,BOOK X.,"from the ground, and he showed me the growth thereof. It was black at"
5591,BOOK X.,"the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but"
5592,BOOK X.,it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are
5593,BOOK X.,possible.
5594,BOOK X.,
5595,BOOK X.,"“Then Hermes departed toward high Olympus, up through the woodland"
5596,BOOK X.,"isle, but as for me I held on my way to the house of Circe, and my"
5597,BOOK X.,heart was darkly troubled as I went. So I halted in the portals of the
5598,BOOK X.,fair-tressed goddess; there I stood and called aloud and the goddess
5599,BOOK X.,"heard my voice, who presently came forth and opened the shining doors"
5600,BOOK X.,"and bade me in, and I went with her heavy at heart. So she led me in"
5601,BOOK X.,"and set me on a chair with studs of silver, a goodly carven chair, and"
5602,BOOK X.,beneath was a footstool for the feet. And she made me a potion in a
5603,BOOK X.,"golden cup, that I might drink, and she also put a charm therein, in"
5604,BOOK X.,the evil counsel of her heart.
5605,BOOK X.,
5606,BOOK X.,“Now when she had given it and I had drunk it off and was not
5607,BOOK X.,"bewitched, she smote me with her wand and spake and hailed me:"
5608,BOOK X.,
5609,BOOK X.,"“‘Go thy way now to the stye, couch thee there with the rest of thy"
5610,BOOK X.,company.’
5611,BOOK X.,
5612,BOOK X.,"“So spake she, but I drew my sharp sword from my thigh and sprang upon"
5613,BOOK X.,"Circe, as one eager to slay her. But with a great cry she slipped"
5614,BOOK X.,"under, and clasped my knees, and bewailing herself spake to me winged"
5615,BOOK X.,words:
5616,BOOK X.,
5617,BOOK X.,"“‘Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence? Where is thy city? Where"
5618,BOOK X.,are they that begat thee? I marvel to see how thou hast drunk of this
5619,BOOK X.,"charm, and wast nowise subdued. Nay, for there lives no man else that"
5620,BOOK X.,"is proof against this charm, whoso hath drunk thereof, and once it hath"
5621,BOOK X.,"passed his lips. But thou hast, methinks, a mind within thee that may"
5622,BOOK X.,"not be enchanted. Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of"
5623,BOOK X.,"the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come"
5624,BOOK X.,"hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship. Nay come, put"
5625,BOOK X.,"thy sword into the sheath, and thereafter let us go up into my bed,"
5626,BOOK X.,that meeting in love and sleep we may trust each the other.’
5627,BOOK X.,
5628,BOOK X.,"“So spake she, but I answered her, saying: ‘Nay, Circe, how canst thou"
5629,BOOK X.,"bid me be gentle to thee, who hast turned my company into swine within"
5630,BOOK X.,"thy halls, and holding me here with a guileful heart requirest me to"
5631,BOOK X.,"pass within thy chamber and go up into thy bed, that so thou mayest"
5632,BOOK X.,"make me a dastard and unmanned when thou hast me naked? Nay, never will"
5633,BOOK X.,"I consent to go up into thy bed, except thou wilt deign, goddess, to"
5634,BOOK X.,"swear a mighty oath, that thou wilt plan nought else of mischief to"
5635,BOOK X.,mine own hurt.’
5636,BOOK X.,
5637,BOOK X.,"“So I spake, and she straightway swore the oath not to harm me, as I"
5638,BOOK X.,"bade her. But when she had sworn and had done that oath, then at last I"
5639,BOOK X.,went up into the beautiful bed of Circe.
5640,BOOK X.,
5641,BOOK X.,"“Now all this while her handmaids busied them in the halls, four"
5642,BOOK X.,maidens that are her serving women in the house. They are born of the
5643,BOOK X.,"wells and of the woods and of the holy rivers, that flow forward into"
5644,BOOK X.,the salt sea. Of these one cast upon the chairs goodly coverlets of
5645,BOOK X.,"purple above, and spread a linen cloth thereunder. And lo, another drew"
5646,BOOK X.,"up silver tables to the chairs, and thereon set for them golden"
5647,BOOK X.,"baskets. And a third mixed sweet honey-hearted wine in a silver bowl,"
5648,BOOK X.,"and set out cups of gold. And a fourth bare water, and kindled a great"
5649,BOOK X.,fire beneath the mighty cauldron. So the water waxed warm; but when it
5650,BOOK X.,"boiled in the bright brazen vessel, she set me in a bath and bathed me"
5651,BOOK X.,"with water from out a great cauldron, pouring it over head and"
5652,BOOK X.,"shoulders, when she had mixed it to a pleasant warmth, till from my"
5653,BOOK X.,limbs she took away the consuming weariness. Now after she had bathed
5654,BOOK X.,"me and anointed me well with olive oil, and cast about me a fair mantle"
5655,BOOK X.,"and a doublet, she led me into the halls and set me on a chair with"
5656,BOOK X.,"studs of silver, a goodly carven chair, and beneath was a footstool for"
5657,BOOK X.,the feet. And a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly golden
5658,BOOK X.,"ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal; and to my"
5659,BOOK X.,"side she drew a polished table, and a grave dame bare wheaten bread and"
5660,BOOK X.,"set it by me, and laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of"
5661,BOOK X.,"such things as she had by her. And she bade me eat, but my soul found"
5662,BOOK X.,"no pleasure therein. I sat with other thoughts, and my heart had a"
5663,BOOK X.,boding of ill.
5664,BOOK X.,
5665,BOOK X.,"“Now when Circe saw that I sat thus, and that I put not forth my hands"
5666,BOOK X.,"to the meat, and that I was mightily afflicted, she drew near to me and"
5667,BOOK X.,spake to me winged words:
5668,BOOK X.,
5669,BOOK X.,"“‘Wherefore thus, Odysseus, dost thou sit there like a speechless man,"
5670,BOOK X.,"consuming thine own soul, and dost not touch meat nor drink? Dost thou"
5671,BOOK X.,"indeed deem there is some further guile? Nay, thou hast no cause to"
5672,BOOK X.,"fear, for already I have sworn thee a strong oath not to harm thee.’"
5673,BOOK X.,
5674,BOOK X.,"“So spake she, but I answered her, saying: ‘Oh, Circe, what righteous"
5675,BOOK X.,man would have the heart to taste meat and drink ere he had redeemed
5676,BOOK X.,"his company, and beheld them face to face? But if in good faith thou"
5677,BOOK X.,"biddest me eat and drink, then let them go free, that mine eyes may"
5678,BOOK X.,behold my dear companions.’
5679,BOOK X.,
5680,BOOK X.,"“So I spake, and Circe passed out through the hall with the wand in her"
5681,BOOK X.,"hand, and opened the doors of the stye, and drave them forth in the"
5682,BOOK X.,"shape of swine of nine seasons old. There they stood before her, and"
5683,BOOK X.,"she went through their midst, and anointed each one of them with"
5684,BOOK X.,"another charm. And lo, from their limbs the bristles dropped away,"
5685,BOOK X.,"wherewith the venom had erewhile clothed them, that lady Circe gave"
5686,BOOK X.,"them. And they became men again, younger than before they were, and"
5687,BOOK X.,"goodlier far, and taller to behold. And they all knew me again and each"
5688,BOOK X.,"one took my hands, and wistful was the lament that sank into their"
5689,BOOK X.,"souls, and the roof around rang wondrously. And even the goddess"
5690,BOOK X.,herself was moved with compassion.
5691,BOOK X.,
5692,BOOK X.,"“Then standing nigh me the fair goddess spake unto me: ‘Son of Laertes,"
5693,BOOK X.,"of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, depart now to thy swift"
5694,BOOK X.,"ship and the sea-banks. And first of all, draw ye up the ship ashore,"
5695,BOOK X.,and bestow the goods in the caves and all the gear. And thyself return
5696,BOOK X.,"again, and bring with thee thy dear companions.’"
5697,BOOK X.,
5698,BOOK X.,"“So spake she, and my lordly spirit consented thereto. So I went on my"
5699,BOOK X.,"way to the swift ship and the sea-banks, and there I found my dear"
5700,BOOK X.,"company on the swift ship lamenting piteously, shedding big tears. And"
5701,BOOK X.,as when calves of the homestead gather round the droves of kine that
5702,BOOK X.,"have returned to the yard, when they have had their fill of pasture,"
5703,BOOK X.,"and all with one accord frisk before them, and the folds may no more"
5704,BOOK X.,"contain them, but with a ceaseless lowing they skip about their dams,"
5705,BOOK X.,"so flocked they all about me weeping, when their eyes beheld me. Yea,"
5706,BOOK X.,and to their spirit it was as though they had got to their dear
5707,BOOK X.,"country, and the very city of rugged Ithaca, where they were born and"
5708,BOOK X.,reared.
5709,BOOK X.,
5710,BOOK X.,“Then making lament they spake to me winged words: ‘O fosterling of
5711,BOOK X.,"Zeus, we were none otherwise glad at thy returning, than if we had come"
5712,BOOK X.,"to Ithaca, our own country. Nay come, of our other companions tell us"
5713,BOOK X.,the tale of their ruin.’
5714,BOOK X.,
5715,BOOK X.,"“So spake they, but I answered them with soft words: ‘Behold, let us"
5716,BOOK X.,"first of all draw up the ship ashore, and bestow our goods in the caves"
5717,BOOK X.,"and all our gear. And do ye bestir you, one and all, to go with me,"
5718,BOOK X.,"that ye may see your fellows in the sacred dwelling of Circe, eating"
5719,BOOK X.,"and drinking, for they have continual store.’"
5720,BOOK X.,
5721,BOOK X.,"“So spake I, and at once they hearkened to my words, but Eurylochus"
5722,BOOK X.,"alone would have holden all my companions, and uttering his voice he"
5723,BOOK X.,spake to them winged words:
5724,BOOK X.,
5725,BOOK X.,“‘Wretched men that we are! whither are we going? Why are your hearts
5726,BOOK X.,"so set on sorrow that ye should go down to the hall of Circe, who will"
5727,BOOK X.,"surely change us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, to guard her great"
5728,BOOK X.,"house perforce, according to the deeds that the Cyclops wrought, when"
5729,BOOK X.,"certain of our company went to his inmost fold, and with them went"
5730,BOOK X.,"Odysseus, ever hardy, for through the blindness of his heart did they"
5731,BOOK X.,too perish?’
5732,BOOK X.,
5733,BOOK X.,"“So spake he, but I mused in my heart whether to draw my long hanger"
5734,BOOK X.,"from my stout thigh, and therewith smite off his head and bring it to"
5735,BOOK X.,"the dust, albeit he was very near of kin to me; but the men of my"
5736,BOOK X.,company stayed me on every side with soothing words:
5737,BOOK X.,
5738,BOOK X.,"“‘Prince of the seed of Zeus, as for this man, we will suffer him, if"
5739,BOOK X.,"thou wilt have it so, to abide here by the ship and guard the ship; but"
5740,BOOK X.,"as for us, be our guide to the sacred house of Circe.’"
5741,BOOK X.,
5742,BOOK X.,"“So they spake and went up from the ship and the sea. Nay, nor yet was"
5743,BOOK X.,"Eurylochus left by the hollow ship, but he went with us, for he feared"
5744,BOOK X.,my terrible rebuke.
5745,BOOK X.,
5746,BOOK X.,“Meanwhile Circe bathed the rest of my company in her halls with all
5747,BOOK X.,"care, and anointed them well with olive oil; and cast thick mantles and"
5748,BOOK X.,doublets about them. And we found them all feasting nobly in the halls.
5749,BOOK X.,"And when they saw and knew each other face to face, they wept and"
5750,BOOK X.,"mourned, and the house rang around. Then she stood near me, that fair"
5751,BOOK X.,"goddess, and spake saying:"
5752,BOOK X.,
5753,BOOK X.,"“‘Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, no"
5754,BOOK X.,more now wake this plenteous weeping: myself I know of all the pains ye
5755,BOOK X.,"endured upon the teeming deep, and the great despite done you by"
5756,BOOK X.,"unkindly men upon the land. Nay come, eat ye meat and drink wine, till"
5757,BOOK X.,"your spirit shall return to you again, as it was when first ye left"
5758,BOOK X.,your own country of rugged Ithaca; but now are ye wasted and wanting
5759,BOOK X.,"heart, mindful evermore of your sore wandering, nor has your heart ever"
5760,BOOK X.,"been merry, for very grievous hath been your trial.’"
5761,BOOK X.,
5762,BOOK X.,"“So spake she, and our lordly spirit consented thereto. So there we sat"
5763,BOOK X.,"day by day for the full circle of a year, feasting on abundant flesh"
5764,BOOK X.,"and sweet wine. But when now a year had gone, and the seasons returned"
5765,BOOK X.,"as the months waned, and the long days came in their course, then did"
5766,BOOK X.,"my dear company call me forth, and say:"
5767,BOOK X.,
5768,BOOK X.,"“‘Good sir, now is it high time to mind thee of thy native land, if it"
5769,BOOK X.,"is ordained that thou shalt be saved, and come to thy lofty house and"
5770,BOOK X.,thine own country.’
5771,BOOK X.,
5772,BOOK X.,“So spake they and my lordly spirit consented thereto. So for that time
5773,BOOK X.,"we sat the livelong day till the going down of the sun, feasting on"
5774,BOOK X.,abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun sank and darkness came
5775,BOOK X.,"on, they laid them to rest throughout the shadowy halls."
5776,BOOK X.,
5777,BOOK X.,"“But when I had gone up into the fair bed of Circe, I besought her by"
5778,BOOK X.,"her knees, and the goddess heard my speech, and uttering my voice I"
5779,BOOK X.,"spake to her winged words: ‘Circe, fulfil for me the promise which thou"
5780,BOOK X.,madest me to send me on my homeward way. Now is my spirit eager to be
5781,BOOK X.,"gone, and the spirit of my company, that wear away my heart as they"
5782,BOOK X.,"mourn around me, when haply thou art gone from us.’"
5783,BOOK X.,
5784,BOOK X.,"“So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: ‘Son of Laertes, of"
5785,BOOK X.,"the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, tarry ye now no longer in"
5786,BOOK X.,"my house against your will; but first must ye perform another journey,"
5787,BOOK X.,and reach the dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone to seek to the
5788,BOOK X.,"spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind soothsayer, whose wits abide"
5789,BOOK X.,"steadfast. To him Persephone hath given judgment, even in death, that"
5790,BOOK X.,he alone should have understanding; but the other souls sweep
5791,BOOK X.,shadow-like around.’
5792,BOOK X.,
5793,BOOK X.,"“Thus spake she, but as for me, my heart was broken, and I wept as I"
5794,BOOK X.,"sat upon the bed, and my soul had no more care to live and to see the"
5795,BOOK X.,"sunlight. But when I had my fill of weeping and grovelling, then at the"
5796,BOOK X.,"last I answered and spake unto her saying: ‘And who, Circe, will guide"
5797,BOOK X.,us on this way? for no man ever yet sailed to hell in a black ship.’
5798,BOOK X.,
5799,BOOK X.,"“So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: ‘Son of Laertes, of"
5800,BOOK X.,"the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, nay, trouble not thyself"
5801,BOOK X.,"for want of a guide, by thy ship abiding, but set up the mast and"
5802,BOOK X.,spread abroad the white sails and sit thee down; and the breeze of the
5803,BOOK X.,North Wind will bear thy vessel on her way. But when thou hast now
5804,BOOK X.,"sailed in thy ship across the stream Oceanus, where is a waste shore"
5805,BOOK X.,"and the groves of Persephone, even tall poplar trees and willows that"
5806,BOOK X.,"shed their fruit before the season, there beach thy ship by deep"
5807,BOOK X.,"eddying Oceanus, but go thyself to the dank house of Hades. Thereby"
5808,BOOK X.,"into Acheron flows Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus, a branch of the water"
5809,BOOK X.,"of the Styx, and there is a rock, and the meeting of the two roaring"
5810,BOOK X.,"waters. So, hero, draw nigh thereto, as I command thee, and dig a"
5811,BOOK X.,"trench as it were a cubit in length and breadth, and about it pour a"
5812,BOOK X.,"drink-offering to all the dead, first with mead and thereafter with"
5813,BOOK X.,"sweet wine, and for the third time with water, and sprinkle white meal"
5814,BOOK X.,thereon; and entreat with many prayers the strengthless heads of the
5815,BOOK X.,"dead, and promise that on thy return to Ithaca thou wilt offer in thy"
5816,BOOK X.,"halls a barren heifer, the best thou hast, and will fill the pyre with"
5817,BOOK X.,"treasure, and wilt sacrifice apart, to Teiresias alone, a black ram"
5818,BOOK X.,"without spot, the fairest of your flock. But when thou hast with"
5819,BOOK X.,"prayers made supplication to the lordly races of the dead, then offer"
5820,BOOK X.,"up a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus and"
5821,BOOK X.,"thyself turn thy back, with thy face set for the shore of the river."
5822,BOOK X.,Then will many spirits come to thee of the dead that be departed.
5823,BOOK X.,Thereafter thou shalt call to thy company and command them to flay the
5824,BOOK X.,"sheep which even now lie slain by the pitiless sword, and to consume"
5825,BOOK X.,"them with fire, and to make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and to"
5826,BOOK X.,dread Persephone. And thyself draw the sharp sword from thy thigh and
5827,BOOK X.,"sit there, suffering not the strengthless heads of the dead to draw"
5828,BOOK X.,"nigh to the blood, ere thou hast word of Teiresias. Then the seer will"
5829,BOOK X.,"come to thee quickly, leader of the people; he will surely declare to"
5830,BOOK X.,"thee the way and the measure of thy path, and as touching thy"
5831,BOOK X.,"returning, how thou mayst go over the teeming deep.’"
5832,BOOK X.,
5833,BOOK X.,"“So spake she, and anon came the golden throned Dawn. Then she put on"
5834,BOOK X.,"me a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and the nymph clad herself in a"
5835,BOOK X.,"great shining robe, light of woof and gracious, and about her waist she"
5836,BOOK X.,"cast a fair golden girdle, and put a veil upon her head. But I passed"
5837,BOOK X.,"through the halls and roused my men with smooth words, standing by each"
5838,BOOK X.,one in turn:
5839,BOOK X.,
5840,BOOK X.,“‘Sleep ye now no more nor breathe sweet slumber; but let us go on our
5841,BOOK X.,"way, for surely she hath shown me all, the lady Circe.’"
5842,BOOK X.,
5843,BOOK X.,"“So spake I, and their lordly soul consented thereto. Yet even thence I"
5844,BOOK X.,"led not my company safe away. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest of"
5845,BOOK X.,"us all, not very valiant in war neither steadfast in mind. He was lying"
5846,BOOK X.,apart from the rest of my men on the housetop of Circe’s sacred
5847,BOOK X.,"dwelling, very fain of the cool air, as one heavy with wine. Now when"
5848,BOOK X.,he heard the noise of the voices and of the feet of my fellows as they
5849,BOOK X.,"moved to and fro, he leaped up of a sudden and minded him not to"
5850,BOOK X.,"descend again by the way of the tall ladder, but fell right down from"
5851,BOOK X.,"the roof, and his neck was broken from the bones of the spine, and his"
5852,BOOK X.,spirit went down to the house of Hades.
5853,BOOK X.,
5854,BOOK X.,"“Then I spake among my men as they went on their way, saying: ‘Ye deem"
5855,BOOK X.,"now, I see, that ye are going to your own dear country; but Circe hath"
5856,BOOK X.,"showed us another way, even to the dwelling of Hades and of dread"
5857,BOOK X.,"Persephone, to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias.’"
5858,BOOK X.,
5859,BOOK X.,"“Even so I spake, but their heart within them was broken, and they sat"
5860,BOOK X.,"them down even where they were, and made lament and tore their hair."
5861,BOOK X.,Howbeit no help came of their weeping.
5862,BOOK X.,
5863,BOOK X.,“But as we were now wending sorrowful to the swift ship and the
5864,BOOK X.,"sea-banks, shedding big tears, Circe meanwhile had gone her ways and"
5865,BOOK X.,"made fast a ram and a black ewe by the dark ship, lightly passing us"
5866,BOOK X.,"by: who may behold a god against his will, whether going to or fro?”"

5877,BOOK XI.,"“Now when we had gone down to the ship and to the sea, first of all we"
5878,BOOK XI.,drew the ship unto the fair salt water and placed the mast and sails in
5879,BOOK XI.,"the black ship, and took those sheep and put them therein, and"
5880,BOOK XI.,"ourselves too climbed on board, sorrowing, and shedding big tears. And"
5881,BOOK XI.,in the wake of our dark-prowed ship she sent a favouring wind that
5882,BOOK XI.,"filled the sails, a kindly escort,—even Circe of the braided tresses, a"
5883,BOOK XI.,dread goddess of human speech. And we set in order all the gear
5884,BOOK XI.,throughout the ship and sat us down; and the wind and the helmsman
5885,BOOK XI.,guided our barque. And all day long her sails were stretched in her
5886,BOOK XI.,seafaring; and the sun sank and all the ways were darkened.
5887,BOOK XI.,
5888,BOOK XI.,"“She came to the limits of the world, to the deep-flowing Oceanus."

5892,BOOK XI.,"earthward from the firmament, but deadly night is outspread over"
5893,BOOK XI.,miserable mortals. Thither we came and ran the ship ashore and took out
5894,BOOK XI.,the sheep; but for our part we held on our way along the stream of
5895,BOOK XI.,"Oceanus, till we came to the place which Circe had declared to us."
5896,BOOK XI.,
5897,BOOK XI.,"“There Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, but I drew my sharp"
5898,BOOK XI.,"sword from my thigh, and dug a pit, as it were a cubit in length and"
5899,BOOK XI.,"breadth, and about it poured a drink-offering to all the dead, first"
5900,BOOK XI.,"with mead and thereafter with sweet wine, and for the third time with"
5901,BOOK XI.,"water. And I sprinkled white meal thereon, and entreated with many"
5902,BOOK XI.,"prayers the strengthless heads of the dead, and promised that on my"
5903,BOOK XI.,"return to Ithaca I would offer in my halls a barren heifer, the best I"
5904,BOOK XI.,"had, and fill the pyre with treasure, and apart unto Teiresias alone"
5905,BOOK XI.,"sacrifice a black ram without spot, the fairest of my flock. But when I"
5906,BOOK XI.,"had besought the tribes of the dead with vows and prayers, I took the"
5907,BOOK XI.,"sheep and cut their throats over the trench, and the dark blood flowed"
5908,BOOK XI.,"forth, and lo, the spirits of the dead that be departed gathered them"
5909,BOOK XI.,"from out of Erebus. Brides and youths unwed, and old men of many and"
5910,BOOK XI.,"evil days, and tender maidens with grief yet fresh at heart; and many"
5911,BOOK XI.,"there were, wounded with bronze-shod spears, men slain in fight with"
5912,BOOK XI.,their bloody mail about them. And these many ghosts flocked together
5913,BOOK XI.,"from every side about the trench with a wondrous cry, and pale fear gat"
5914,BOOK XI.,hold on me. Then did I speak to my company and command them to flay the
5915,BOOK XI.,"sheep that lay slain by the pitiless sword, and to consume them with"
5916,BOOK XI.,"fire, and to make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and to dread"
5917,BOOK XI.,"Persephone, and myself I drew the sharp sword from my thigh and sat"
5918,BOOK XI.,"there, suffering not the strengthless heads of the dead to draw nigh to"
5919,BOOK XI.,"the blood, ere I had word of Teiresias."
5920,BOOK XI.,
5921,BOOK XI.,"“And first came the soul of Elpenor, my companion, that had not yet"

5923,BOOK XI.,"us in the hall of Circe, unwept and unburied, seeing that another task"
5924,BOOK XI.,was instant on us. At the sight of him I wept and had compassion on
5925,BOOK XI.,"him, and uttering my voice spake to him winged words: ‘Elpenor, how"
5926,BOOK XI.,hast thou come beneath the darkness and the shadow? Thou hast come
5927,BOOK XI.,fleeter on foot than I in my black ship.’
5928,BOOK XI.,

5932,BOOK XI.,house-top of Circe I minded me not to descend again by the way of the
5933,BOOK XI.,"tall ladder, but fell right down from the roof, and my neck was broken"
5934,BOOK XI.,"off from the bones of the spine, and my spirit went down to the house"
5935,BOOK XI.,"of Hades. And now I pray thee in the name of those whom we left, who"
5936,BOOK XI.,"are no more with us, thy wife, and thy sire who cherished thee when as"
5937,BOOK XI.,"yet thou wert a little one, and Telemachus, whom thou didst leave in"
5938,BOOK XI.,thy halls alone; forasmuch as I know that on thy way hence from out the
5939,BOOK XI.,"dwelling of Hades, thou wilt stay thy well-wrought ship at the isle"
5940,BOOK XI.,"Aeaean, even then, my lord, I charge thee to think on me. Leave me not"
5941,BOOK XI.,"unwept and unburied as thou goest hence, nor turn thy back upon me,"
5942,BOOK XI.,"lest haply I bring on thee the anger of the gods. Nay, burn me there"
5943,BOOK XI.,"with mine armour, all that is mine, and pile me a barrow on the shore"
5944,BOOK XI.,"of the grey sea, the grave of a luckless man, that even men unborn may"
5945,BOOK XI.,"hear my story. Fulfil me this and plant upon the barrow mine oar,"

5952,BOOK XI.,"“Even so we twain were sitting holding sad discourse, I on the one"

5955,BOOK XI.,
5956,BOOK XI.,"“Anon came up the soul of my mother dead, Anticleia, the daughter of"

5958,BOOK XI.,"sacred Ilios. At the sight of her I wept, and was moved with"
5959,BOOK XI.,"compassion, yet even so, for all my sore grief, I suffered her not to"

5961,BOOK XI.,
5962,BOOK XI.,"“Anon came the soul of Theban Teiresias, with a golden sceptre in his"

5965,BOOK XI.,wherefore hast thou left the sunlight and come hither to behold the
5966,BOOK XI.,"dead and a land desolate of joy? Nay, hold off from the ditch and draw"
5967,BOOK XI.,"back thy sharp sword, that I may drink of the blood and tell thee"
5968,BOOK XI.,sooth.’
5969,BOOK XI.,
5970,BOOK XI.,"“So spake he and I put up my silver-studded sword into the sheath, and"
5971,BOOK XI.,"when he had drunk the dark blood, even then did the noble seer speak"
5972,BOOK XI.,"unto me, saying: Thou art asking of thy sweet returning, great"
5973,BOOK XI.,"Odysseus, but that will the god make hard for thee; for methinks thou"
5974,BOOK XI.,"shalt not pass unheeded by the Shaker of the Earth, who hath laid up"
5975,BOOK XI.,"wrath in his heart against thee, for rage at the blinding of his dear"
5976,BOOK XI.,"son. Yet even so, through many troubles, ye may come home, if thou wilt"
5977,BOOK XI.,restrain thy spirit and the spirit of thy men so soon as thou shalt
5978,BOOK XI.,"bring thy well-wrought ship nigh to the isle Thrinacia, fleeing the sea"
5979,BOOK XI.,"of violet blue, when ye find the herds of Helios grazing and his brave"
5980,BOOK XI.,"flocks, of Helios who overseeth all and overheareth all things. If thou"
5981,BOOK XI.,"doest these no hurt, being heedful of thy return, so may ye yet reach"
5982,BOOK XI.,"Ithaca, albeit in evil case. But if thou hurtest them, I foreshow ruin"
5983,BOOK XI.,"for thy ship and for thy men, and even though thou shalt thyself"
5984,BOOK XI.,"escape, late shalt thou return in evil plight, with the loss of all thy"
5985,BOOK XI.,"company, on board the ship of strangers, and thou shalt find sorrows in"
5986,BOOK XI.,"thy house, even proud men that devour thy living, while they woo thy"
5987,BOOK XI.,"godlike wife and offer the gifts of wooing. Yet I tell thee, on thy"
5988,BOOK XI.,coming thou shalt avenge their violence. But when thou hast slain the
5989,BOOK XI.,"wooers in thy halls, whether by guile, or openly with the edge of the"
5990,BOOK XI.,"sword, thereafter go thy way, taking with thee a shapen oar, till thou"
5991,BOOK XI.,"shalt come to such men as know not the sea, neither eat meat savoured"
5992,BOOK XI.,"with salt; yea, nor have they knowledge of ships of purple cheek, nor"
5993,BOOK XI.,shapen oars which serve for wings to ships. And I will give thee a most
5994,BOOK XI.,"manifest token, which cannot escape thee. In the day when another"
5995,BOOK XI.,wayfarer shall meet thee and say that thou hast a winnowing fan on thy
5996,BOOK XI.,"stout shoulder, even then make fast thy shapen oar in the earth and do"
5997,BOOK XI.,"goodly sacrifice to the lord Poseidon, even with a ram and a bull and a"
5998,BOOK XI.,"boar, the mate of swine, and depart for home and offer holy hecatombs"
5999,BOOK XI.,"to the deathless gods that keep the wide heaven, to each in order due."
6000,BOOK XI.,"And from the sea shall thine own death come, the gentlest death that"

6007,BOOK XI.,"lo, she sits in silence near the blood, nor deigns to look her son in"

6009,BOOK XI.,that I am he?’
6010,BOOK XI.,
6011,BOOK XI.,"“So spake I, and anon he answered me, and said: ‘I will tell thee an"

6014,BOOK XI.,"thee sooth; but if thou shalt grudge any, that one shall go to his own"

6016,BOOK XI.,"within the house of Hades, when he had told all his oracles. But I"
6017,BOOK XI.,"abode there steadfastly, till my mother drew nigh and drank the dark"
6018,BOOK XI.,"blood; and at once she knew me, and bewailing herself spake to me"
6019,BOOK XI.,winged words:
6020,BOOK XI.,
6021,BOOK XI.,"“‘Dear child, how didst thou come beneath the darkness and the shadow,"
6022,BOOK XI.,thou that art a living man? Grievous is the sight of these things to
6023,BOOK XI.,"the living, for between us and you are great rivers and dreadful"
6024,BOOK XI.,"streams; first, Oceanus, which can no wise be crossed on foot, but only"
6025,BOOK XI.,if one have a well wrought ship. Art thou but now come hither with thy
6026,BOOK XI.,ship and thy company in thy long wanderings from Troy? and hast thou
6027,BOOK XI.,"not yet reached Ithaca, nor seen thy wife in thy halls?’"
6028,BOOK XI.,
6029,BOOK XI.,"“Even so she spake, and I answered her, and said: ‘O my mother,"
6030,BOOK XI.,necessity was on me to come down to the house of Hades to seek to the
6031,BOOK XI.,spirit of Theban Teiresias. For not yet have I drawn near to the
6032,BOOK XI.,"Achaean shore, nor yet have I set foot on mine own country, but have"
6033,BOOK XI.,"been wandering evermore in affliction, from the day that first I went"
6034,BOOK XI.,"with goodly Agamemnon to Ilios of the fair steeds, to do battle with"
6035,BOOK XI.,"the Trojans. But come, declare me this and plainly tell it all. What"
6036,BOOK XI.,doom overcame thee of death that lays men at their length? Was it a
6037,BOOK XI.,"slow disease, or did Artemis the archer slay thee with the visitation"
6038,BOOK XI.,"of her gentle shafts? And tell me of my father and my son, that I left"
6039,BOOK XI.,"behind me; doth my honour yet abide with them, or hath another already"
6040,BOOK XI.,"taken it, while they say that I shall come home no more? And tell me of"
6041,BOOK XI.,"my wedded wife, of her counsel and her purpose, doth she abide with her"
6042,BOOK XI.,"son and keep all secure, or hath she already wedded the best of the"
6043,BOOK XI.,Achaeans?’
6044,BOOK XI.,
6045,BOOK XI.,"“Even so I spake, and anon my lady mother answered me: ‘Yea verily, she"
6046,BOOK XI.,abideth with steadfast spirit in thy halls; and wearily for her the
6047,BOOK XI.,nights wane always and the days in shedding of tears. But the fair
6048,BOOK XI.,honour that is thine no man hath yet taken; but Telemachus sits at
6049,BOOK XI.,"peace on his demesne, and feasts at equal banquets, whereof it is meet"
6050,BOOK XI.,"that a judge partake, for all men bid him to their house. And thy"
6051,BOOK XI.,"father abides there in the field, and goes not down to the town, nor"
6052,BOOK XI.,"lies he on bedding or rugs or shining blankets, but all the winter he"
6053,BOOK XI.,"sleeps, where sleep the thralls in the house, in the ashes by the fire,"
6054,BOOK XI.,and is clad in sorry raiment. But when the summer comes and the rich
6055,BOOK XI.,"harvest-tide, his beds of fallen leaves are strewn lowly all about the"
6056,BOOK XI.,knoll of his vineyard plot. There he lies sorrowing and nurses his
6057,BOOK XI.,"mighty grief, for long desire of thy return, and old age withal comes"
6058,BOOK XI.,heavy upon him. Yea and even so did I too perish and meet my doom. It
6059,BOOK XI.,"was not the archer goddess of the keen sight, who slew me in my halls"
6060,BOOK XI.,"with the visitation of her gentle shafts, nor did any sickness come"
6061,BOOK XI.,"upon me, such as chiefly with a sad wasting draws the spirit from the"
6062,BOOK XI.,"limbs; nay, it was my sore longing for thee, and for thy counsels,"
6063,BOOK XI.,"great Odysseus, and for thy loving-kindness, that reft me of sweet"
6064,BOOK XI.,life.’
6065,BOOK XI.,
6066,BOOK XI.,"“So spake she, and I mused in my heart and would fain have embraced the"
6067,BOOK XI.,"spirit of my mother dead. Thrice I sprang towards her, and was minded"
6068,BOOK XI.,to embrace her; thrice she flitted from my hands as a shadow or even as
6069,BOOK XI.,"a dream, and sharp grief arose ever at my heart. And uttering my voice"
6070,BOOK XI.,I spake to her winged words:
6071,BOOK XI.,
6072,BOOK XI.,"“‘Mother mine, wherefore dost thou not abide me who am eager to clasp"
6073,BOOK XI.,"thee, that even in Hades we twain may cast our arms each about the"
6074,BOOK XI.,"other, and have our fill of chill lament? Is this but a phantom that"
6075,BOOK XI.,"the high goddess Persephone hath sent me, to the end that I may groan"
6076,BOOK XI.,for more exceeding sorrow?’
6077,BOOK XI.,
6078,BOOK XI.,"“So spake I, and my lady mother answered me anon: ‘Ah me, my child, of"
6079,BOOK XI.,"all men most ill-fated, Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, doth in no"
6080,BOOK XI.,"wise deceive thee, but even on this wise it is with mortals when they"
6081,BOOK XI.,"die. For the sinews no more bind together the flesh and the bones, but"
6082,BOOK XI.,"the great force of burning fire abolishes these, so soon as the life"
6083,BOOK XI.,"hath left the white bones, and the spirit like a dream flies forth and"
6084,BOOK XI.,"hovers near. But haste with all thine heart toward the sunlight, and"
6085,BOOK XI.,"mark all this, that even hereafter thou mayest tell it to thy wife.’"
6086,BOOK XI.,
6087,BOOK XI.,"“Thus we twain held discourse together; and lo, the women came up, for"
6088,BOOK XI.,"the high goddess Persephone sent them forth, all they that had been the"
6089,BOOK XI.,wives and daughters of mighty men. And they gathered and flocked about
6090,BOOK XI.,"the black blood, and I took counsel how I might question them each one."
6091,BOOK XI.,And this was the counsel that showed best in my sight. I drew my long
6092,BOOK XI.,"hanger from my stalwart thigh, and suffered them not all at one time to"
6093,BOOK XI.,"drink of the dark blood. So they drew nigh one by one, and each"
6094,BOOK XI.,"declared her lineage, and I made question of all."
6095,BOOK XI.,
6096,BOOK XI.,"“Then verily did I first see Tyro, sprung of a noble sire, who said"
6097,BOOK XI.,"that she was the child of noble Salmoneus, and declared herself the"
6098,BOOK XI.,"wife of Cretheus, son of Aeolus. She loved a river, the divine Enipeus,"
6099,BOOK XI.,"far the fairest of the floods that run upon the earth, and she would"
6100,BOOK XI.,resort to the fair streams of Enipeus. And it came to pass that the
6101,BOOK XI.,"girdler of the world, the Earth-shaker, put on the shape of the god,"
6102,BOOK XI.,and lay by the lady at the mouths of the whirling stream. Then the dark
6103,BOOK XI.,"wave stood around them like a hill-side bowed, and hid the god and the"
6104,BOOK XI.,"mortal woman. And he undid her maiden girdle, and shed a slumber over"
6105,BOOK XI.,"her. Now when the god had done the work of love, he clasped her hand"
6106,BOOK XI.,and spake and hailed her:
6107,BOOK XI.,
6108,BOOK XI.,"“‘Woman, be glad in our love, and when the year comes round thou shalt"
6109,BOOK XI.,"give birth to glorious children,—for not weak are the embraces of the"
6110,BOOK XI.,"gods,—and do thou keep and cherish them. And now go home and hold thy"
6111,BOOK XI.,"peace, and tell it not: but behold, I am Poseidon, shaker of the"
6112,BOOK XI.,earth.’
6113,BOOK XI.,
6114,BOOK XI.,“Therewith he plunged beneath the heaving deep. And she conceived and
6115,BOOK XI.,"bare Pelias and Neleus, who both grew to be mighty men, servants of"
6116,BOOK XI.,"Zeus. Pelias dwelt in wide Iolcos, and was rich in flocks; and that"
6117,BOOK XI.,other abode in sandy Pylos. And the queen of women bare yet other sons
6118,BOOK XI.,"to Cretheus, even Aeson and Pheres and Amythaon, whose joy was in"
6119,BOOK XI.,chariots.
6120,BOOK XI.,
6121,BOOK XI.,"“And after her I saw Antiope, daughter of Asopus, and her boast was"
6122,BOOK XI.,"that she had slept even in the arms of Zeus, and she bare two sons,"
6123,BOOK XI.,"Amphion and Zethus, who founded first the place of seven-gated Thebes,"
6124,BOOK XI.,"and they made of it a fenced city, for they might not dwell in spacious"
6125,BOOK XI.,"Thebes unfenced, for all their valiancy."
6126,BOOK XI.,
6127,BOOK XI.,"“Next to her I saw Alcmene, wife of Amphitryon, who lay in the arms of"
6128,BOOK XI.,"mighty Zeus, and bare Heracles of the lion-heart, steadfast in the"
6129,BOOK XI.,"fight. And I saw Megara, daughter of Creon, haughty of heart, whom the"
6130,BOOK XI.,strong and tireless son of Amphitryon had to wife.
6131,BOOK XI.,
6132,BOOK XI.,"“And I saw the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste, who wrought a dread"
6133,BOOK XI.,"deed unwittingly, being wedded to her own son, and he that had slain"
6134,BOOK XI.,"his own father wedded her, and straightway the gods made these things"
6135,BOOK XI.,"known to men. Yet he abode in pain in pleasant Thebes, ruling the"
6136,BOOK XI.,"Cadmaeans, by reason of the deadly counsels of the gods. But she went"
6137,BOOK XI.,"down to the house of Hades, the mighty warder; yea, she tied a noose"
6138,BOOK XI.,"from the high beam aloft, being fast holden in sorrow; while for him"
6139,BOOK XI.,"she left pains behind full many, even all that the Avengers of a mother"
6140,BOOK XI.,bring to pass.
6141,BOOK XI.,
6142,BOOK XI.,"“And I saw lovely Chloris, whom Neleus wedded on a time for her beauty,"
6143,BOOK XI.,and brought gifts of wooing past number. She was the youngest daughter
6144,BOOK XI.,"of Amphion, son of Iasus, who once ruled mightily in Minyan Orchomenus."
6145,BOOK XI.,"And she was queen of Pylos, and bare glorious children to her lord,"
6146,BOOK XI.,"Nestor and Chromius, and princely Periclymenus, and stately Pero too,"
6147,BOOK XI.,the wonder of all men. All that dwelt around were her wooers; but
6148,BOOK XI.,"Neleus would not give her, save to him who should drive off from"
6149,BOOK XI.,"Phylace the kine of mighty Iphicles, with shambling gait and broad of"
6150,BOOK XI.,"brow, hard cattle to drive. And none but the noble seer[19] took in"
6151,BOOK XI.,"hand to drive them; but a grievous fate from the gods fettered him,"
6152,BOOK XI.,even hard bonds and the herdsmen of the wild. But when at length the
6153,BOOK XI.,"months and days were being fulfilled, as the year returned upon his"
6154,BOOK XI.,"course, and the seasons came round, then did mighty Iphicles set him"
6155,BOOK XI.,"free, when he had spoken out all the oracles; and herein was the"
6156,BOOK XI.,counsel of Zeus being accomplished.
6157,BOOK XI.,
6158,BOOK XI.,[19] Melampus
6159,BOOK XI.,
6160,BOOK XI.,
6161,BOOK XI.,"“And I saw Lede, the famous bed-fellow of Tyndareus, who bare to"
6162,BOOK XI.,"Tyndareus two sons, hardy of heart, Castor tamer of steeds, and"
6163,BOOK XI.,"Polydeuces the boxer. These twain yet live, but the quickening earth is"
6164,BOOK XI.,over them; and even in the nether world they have honour at the hand of
6165,BOOK XI.,"Zeus. And they possess their life in turn, living one day and dying the"
6166,BOOK XI.,"next, and they have gotten worship even as the gods."
6167,BOOK XI.,
6168,BOOK XI.,"“And after her I beheld Iphimedeia, bed-fellow of Aloeus, who said that"
6169,BOOK XI.,"she had lain with Poseidon, and she bare children twain, but short of"
6170,BOOK XI.,"life were they, godlike Otus and far-famed Ephialtes. Now these were"
6171,BOOK XI.,"the tallest men that earth, the graingiver, ever reared, and far the"
6172,BOOK XI.,goodliest after the renowned Orion. At nine seasons old they were of
6173,BOOK XI.,"breadth nine cubits, and nine fathoms in height. They it was who"
6174,BOOK XI.,threatened to raise even against the immortals in Olympus the din of
6175,BOOK XI.,"stormy war. They strove to pile Ossa on Olympus, and on Ossa Pelion"
6176,BOOK XI.,"with the trembling forest leaves, that there might be a pathway to the"
6177,BOOK XI.,"sky. Yea, and they would have accomplished it, had they reached the"
6178,BOOK XI.,"full measure of manhood. But the son of Zeus, whom Leto of the fair"
6179,BOOK XI.,"locks bare, destroyed the twain, ere the down had bloomed beneath their"
6180,BOOK XI.,"temples, and darkened their chins with the blossom of youth."
6181,BOOK XI.,
6182,BOOK XI.,"“And Phaedra and Procris I saw, and fair Ariadne, the daughter of"
6183,BOOK XI.,"wizard Minos, whom Theseus on a time was bearing from Crete to the hill"
6184,BOOK XI.,"of sacred Athens, yet had he no joy of her; for Artemis slew her ere"
6185,BOOK XI.,"that in sea-girt Dia, by reason of the witness of Dionysus."
6186,BOOK XI.,
6187,BOOK XI.,"“And Maera and Clymene I saw, and hateful Eriphyle, who took fine gold"
6188,BOOK XI.,for the price of her dear lord’s life. But I cannot tell or name all
6189,BOOK XI.,"the wives and daughters of the heroes that I saw; ere that, the"
6190,BOOK XI.,"immortal night would wane. Nay, it is even now time to sleep, whether I"
6191,BOOK XI.,go to the swift ship to my company or abide here: and for my convoy you
6192,BOOK XI.,and the gods will care.”
6193,BOOK XI.,
6194,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and dead silence fell on all, and they were spell-bound"
6195,BOOK XI.,throughout the shadowy halls. Then Arete of the white arms first spake
6196,BOOK XI.,"among them: “Phaeacians, what think you of this man for comeliness and"
6197,BOOK XI.,"stature, and within for wisdom of heart? Moreover he is my guest,"
6198,BOOK XI.,though every one of you hath his share in this honour. Wherefore haste
6199,BOOK XI.,"not to send him hence, and stint not these your gifts for one that"
6200,BOOK XI.,stands in such sore need of them; for ye have much treasure stored in
6201,BOOK XI.,your halls by the grace of the gods.”
6202,BOOK XI.,
6203,BOOK XI.,"Then too spake among them the old man, lord Echeneus, that was an elder"
6204,BOOK XI.,"among the Phaeacians: “Friends, behold, the speech of our wise queen is"
6205,BOOK XI.,"not wide of the mark, nor far from our deeming, so hearken ye thereto."
6206,BOOK XI.,But on Alcinous here both word and work depend.”
6207,BOOK XI.,
6208,BOOK XI.,"Then Alcinous made answer, and spake unto him: “Yea, the word that she"
6209,BOOK XI.,"hath spoken shall hold, if indeed I am yet to live and bear rule among"
6210,BOOK XI.,"the Phaeacians, masters of the oar. Howbeit let the stranger, for all"
6211,BOOK XI.,"his craving to return, nevertheless endure to abide until the morrow,"
6212,BOOK XI.,till I make up the full measure of the gift; and men shall care for his
6213,BOOK XI.,"convoy, all men, but I in chief, for mine is the lordship in the land.”"
6214,BOOK XI.,
6215,BOOK XI.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: My lord Alcinous,"
6216,BOOK XI.,"most notable of all the people, if ye bade me tarry here even for a"
6217,BOOK XI.,"year, and would speed my convoy and give me splendid gifts, even that I"
6218,BOOK XI.,would choose; and better would it be for me to come with a fuller hand
6219,BOOK XI.,"to mine own dear country, so should I get more love and worship in the"
6220,BOOK XI.,"eyes of all men, whoso should see me after I was returned to Ithaca.”"
6221,BOOK XI.,
6222,BOOK XI.,"And Alcinous answered him, saying: “Odysseus, in no wise do we deem"
6223,BOOK XI.,"thee, we that look on thee, to be a knave or a cheat, even as the dark"
6224,BOOK XI.,"earth rears many such broadcast, fashioning lies whence none can even"
6225,BOOK XI.,"see his way therein. But beauty crowns thy words, and wisdom is within"
6226,BOOK XI.,"thee; and thy tale, as when a minstrel sings, thou hast told with"
6227,BOOK XI.,"skill, the weary woes of all the Argives and of thine own self. But"
6228,BOOK XI.,"come, declare me this and plainly tell it all. Didst thou see any of"
6229,BOOK XI.,thy godlike company who went up at the same time with thee to Ilios and
6230,BOOK XI.,"there met their doom? Behold, the night is of great length,"
6231,BOOK XI.,"unspeakable, and the time for sleep in the hall is not yet; tell me"
6232,BOOK XI.,therefore of those wondrous deeds. I could abide even till the bright
6233,BOOK XI.,"dawn, so long as thou couldst endure to rehearse me these woes of thine"
6234,BOOK XI.,in the hall.”
6235,BOOK XI.,
6236,BOOK XI.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: “My lord Alcinous,"
6237,BOOK XI.,"most notable of all the people, there is a time for many words and"
6238,BOOK XI.,"there is a time for sleep. But if thou art eager still to listen, I"
6239,BOOK XI.,would not for my part grudge to tell thee of other things more pitiful
6240,BOOK XI.,"still, even the woes of my comrades, those that perished afterward, for"
6241,BOOK XI.,they had escaped with their lives from the dread war-cry of the
6242,BOOK XI.,"Trojans, but perished in returning by the will of an evil woman."
6243,BOOK XI.,
6244,BOOK XI.,“Now when holy Persephone had scattered this way and that the spirits
6245,BOOK XI.,"of the women folk, thereafter came the soul of Agamemnon, son of"
6246,BOOK XI.,"Atreus, sorrowing; and round him others were gathered, the ghosts of"
6247,BOOK XI.,them who had died with him in the house of Aegisthus and met their
6248,BOOK XI.,"doom. And he knew me straightway when he had drunk the dark blood, yea,"
6249,BOOK XI.,"and he wept aloud, and shed big tears as he stretched forth his hands"
6250,BOOK XI.,"in his longing to reach me. But it might not be, for he had now no"
6251,BOOK XI.,"steadfast strength nor power at all in moving, such as was aforetime in"
6252,BOOK XI.,his supple limbs.
6253,BOOK XI.,
6254,BOOK XI.,"“At the sight of him I wept and was moved with compassion, and uttering"
6255,BOOK XI.,"my voice, spake to him winged words: ‘Most renowned son of Atreus,"
6256,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon, king of men, say what doom overcame thee of death that lays"
6257,BOOK XI.,"men at their length? Did Poseidon smite thee in thy ships, raising the"
6258,BOOK XI.,"dolorous blast of contrary winds, or did unfriendly men do thee hurt"
6259,BOOK XI.,"upon the land, whilst thou wert cutting off their oxen and fair flocks"
6260,BOOK XI.,"of sheep, or fighting to win a city and the women thereof?’"
6261,BOOK XI.,
6262,BOOK XI.,"“So spake I, and straightway he answered, and said unto me: ‘Son of"
6263,BOOK XI.,"Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, it was not"
6264,BOOK XI.,"Poseidon that smote me in my ships, and raised the dolorous blast of"
6265,BOOK XI.,"contrary winds, nor did unfriendly men do me hurt upon the land, but"
6266,BOOK XI.,"Aegisthus it was that wrought me death and doom and slew me, with the"
6267,BOOK XI.,"aid of my accursed wife, as one slays an ox at the stall, after he had"
6268,BOOK XI.,"bidden me to his house, and entertained me at a feast. Even so I died"
6269,BOOK XI.,"by a death most pitiful, and round me my company likewise were slain"
6270,BOOK XI.,"without ceasing, like swine with glittering tusks which are slaughtered"
6271,BOOK XI.,"in the house of a rich and mighty man, whether at a wedding banquet or"
6272,BOOK XI.,a joint-feast or a rich clan-drinking. Ere now hast thou been at the
6273,BOOK XI.,"slaying of many a man, killed in single fight or in strong battle, yet"
6274,BOOK XI.,"thou wouldst have sorrowed the most at this sight, how we lay in the"
6275,BOOK XI.,"hall round the mixing-bowl and the laden boards, and the floor all ran"
6276,BOOK XI.,with blood. And most pitiful of all that I heard was the voice of the
6277,BOOK XI.,"daughter of Priam, of Cassandra, whom hard by me the crafty"
6278,BOOK XI.,Clytemnestra slew. Then I strove to raise my hands as I was dying upon
6279,BOOK XI.,"the sword, but to earth they fell. And that shameless one turned her"
6280,BOOK XI.,"back upon me, and had not the heart to draw down my eyelids with her"
6281,BOOK XI.,fingers nor to close my mouth. So surely is there nought more terrible
6282,BOOK XI.,"and shameless than a woman who imagines such evil in her heart, even as"
6283,BOOK XI.,"she too planned a foul deed, fashioning death for her wedded lord."
6284,BOOK XI.,Verily I had thought to come home most welcome to my children and my
6285,BOOK XI.,"thralls; but she, out of the depth of her evil knowledge, hath shed"
6286,BOOK XI.,"shame on herself and on all womankind, which shall be for ever, even on"
6287,BOOK XI.,the upright.’
6288,BOOK XI.,
6289,BOOK XI.,"“Even so he spake, but I answered him, saying: ‘Lo now, in very sooth,"
6290,BOOK XI.,hath Zeus of the far-borne voice wreaked wondrous hatred on the seed of
6291,BOOK XI.,Atreus through the counsels of woman from of old. For Helen’s sake so
6292,BOOK XI.,"many of us perished, and now Clytemnestra hath practised treason"
6293,BOOK XI.,"against thee, while yet thou wast afar off.’"
6294,BOOK XI.,
6295,BOOK XI.,"“Even so I spake, and anon he answered me, saying: ‘Wherefore do thou"
6296,BOOK XI.,"too, never henceforth be soft even to thy wife, neither show her all"
6297,BOOK XI.,"the counsel that thou knowest, but a part declare and let part be hid."
6298,BOOK XI.,"Yet shalt not thou, Odysseus, find death at the hand of thy wife, for"
6299,BOOK XI.,"she is very discreet and prudent in all her ways, the wise Penelope,"
6300,BOOK XI.,daughter of Icarius. Verily we left her a bride new wed when we went to
6301,BOOK XI.,"the war, and a child was at her breast, who now, methinks, sits in the"
6302,BOOK XI.,"ranks of men, happy in his lot, for his dear father shall behold him on"
6303,BOOK XI.,"his coming, and he shall embrace his sire as is meet. But us for my"
6304,BOOK XI.,"wife, she suffered me not so much as to have my fill of gazing on my"
6305,BOOK XI.,"son; ere that she slew me, even her lord. And yet another thing will I"
6306,BOOK XI.,"tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart. Put thy ship to land in"
6307,BOOK XI.,"secret, and not openly, on the shore of thy dear country; for there is"
6308,BOOK XI.,"no more faith in woman. But come, declare me this and plainly tell it"
6309,BOOK XI.,"all, if haply ye hear of my son as yet living, either, it may be, in"
6310,BOOK XI.,"Orchomenus or in sandy Pylos, or perchance with Menelaus in wide"
6311,BOOK XI.,"Sparta, for goodly Orestes hath not yet perished on the earth.’"
6312,BOOK XI.,
6313,BOOK XI.,"“Even so he spake, but I answered him, saying: ‘Son of Atreus,"
6314,BOOK XI.,wherefore dost thou ask me straitly of these things? Nay I know not at
6315,BOOK XI.,"all, whether he be alive or dead; it is ill to speak words light as"
6316,BOOK XI.,wind.’
6317,BOOK XI.,
6318,BOOK XI.,"“Thus we twain stood sorrowing, holding sad discourse, while the big"
6319,BOOK XI.,"tears fell fast: and therewithal came the soul of Achilles, son of"
6320,BOOK XI.,"Peleus, and of Patroclus and of noble Antilochus and of Aias, who in"
6321,BOOK XI.,"face and form was goodliest of all the Danaans, after the noble son of"
6322,BOOK XI.,"Peleus. And the spirit of the son of Aeacus, fleet of foot, knew me"
6323,BOOK XI.,"again, and making lament spake to me winged words:"
6324,BOOK XI.,
6325,BOOK XI.,"“‘Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, man"
6326,BOOK XI.,"overbold, what new deed and hardier than this wilt thou devise in thy"
6327,BOOK XI.,"heart? How durst thou come down to the house of Hades, where dwell the"
6328,BOOK XI.,"senseless dead, the phantoms of men outworn?’"
6329,BOOK XI.,
6330,BOOK XI.,"“So he spake, but I answered him: ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest"
6331,BOOK XI.,"far of the Achaeans, I am come hither to seek to Teiresias, if he may"
6332,BOOK XI.,"tell me any counsel, how I may come to rugged Ithaca. For not yet have"
6333,BOOK XI.,"I come nigh the Achaean land, nor set foot on mine own soil, but am"
6334,BOOK XI.,"still in evil case; while as for thee, Achilles, none other than thou"
6335,BOOK XI.,"wast heretofore the most blessed of men, nor shall any be hereafter."
6336,BOOK XI.,"For of old, in the days of thy life, we Argives gave thee one honour"
6337,BOOK XI.,"with the gods, and now thou art a great prince here among the dead."
6338,BOOK XI.,"Wherefore let not thy death be any grief to thee, Achilles.’"
6339,BOOK XI.,
6340,BOOK XI.,"“Even so I spake, and he straightway answered me, and said: ‘Nay, speak"
6341,BOOK XI.,"not comfortably to me of death, oh great Odysseus. Rather would I live"
6342,BOOK XI.,"on ground[20] as the hireling of another, with a landless man who had"
6343,BOOK XI.,"no great livelihood, than bear sway among all the dead that be"
6344,BOOK XI.,"departed. But come, tell me tidings of that lordly son of mine—did he"
6345,BOOK XI.,"follow to the war to be a leader or not? And tell me of noble Peleus,"
6346,BOOK XI.,"if thou hast heard aught,—is he yet held in worship among the"
6347,BOOK XI.,"Myrmidons, or do they dishonour him from Hellas to Phthia, for that old"
6348,BOOK XI.,age binds him hand and foot? For I am no longer his champion under the
6349,BOOK XI.,"sun, so mighty a man as once I was, when in wide Troy I slew the best"
6350,BOOK XI.,"of the host, and succoured the Argives. Ah! could I but come for an"
6351,BOOK XI.,"hour to my father’s house as then I was, so would I make my might and"
6352,BOOK XI.,"hands invincible, to be hateful to many an one of those who do him"
6353,BOOK XI.,despite and keep him from his honour.’
6354,BOOK XI.,
6355,BOOK XI.,"[20] ἐπάρουρος seems to mean “upon the earth,” “above ground,” as"
6356,BOOK XI.,"opposed to the dead who are below, rather than “bound to the soil,” in"
6357,BOOK XI.,which sense most commentators take it.
6358,BOOK XI.,
6359,BOOK XI.,
6360,BOOK XI.,"“Even so he spake, but I answered him saying: ‘As for noble Peleus,"
6361,BOOK XI.,verily I have heard nought of him; but concerning thy dear son
6362,BOOK XI.,"Neoptolemus, I will tell thee all the truth, according to thy word. It"
6363,BOOK XI.,"was I that led him up out of Scyros in my good hollow ship, in the wake"
6364,BOOK XI.,of the goodly-greaved Achaeans. Now oft as we took counsel around Troy
6365,BOOK XI.,"town, he was ever the first to speak, and no word missed the mark; the"
6366,BOOK XI.,godlike Nestor and I alone surpassed him. But whensoever we Achaeans
6367,BOOK XI.,"did battle on the plain of Troy, he never tarried behind in the throng"
6368,BOOK XI.,"or the press of men, but ran out far before us all, yielding to none in"
6369,BOOK XI.,that might of his. And many men he slew in warfare dread; but I could
6370,BOOK XI.,"not tell of all or name their names, even all the host he slew in"
6371,BOOK XI.,"succouring the Argives; but, ah, how he smote with the sword that son"
6372,BOOK XI.,"of Telephus, the hero Eurypylus, and many Ceteians[21] of his company"
6373,BOOK XI.,"were slain around him, by reason of a woman’s bribe. He truly was the"
6374,BOOK XI.,"comeliest man that ever I saw, next to goodly Memnon. And again when"
6375,BOOK XI.,"we, the best of the Argives, were about to go down into the horse which"
6376,BOOK XI.,"Epeus wrought, and the charge of all was laid on me, both to open the"
6377,BOOK XI.,"door of our good ambush and to shut the same, then did the other"
6378,BOOK XI.,"princes and counsellors of the Danaans wipe away the tears, and the"
6379,BOOK XI.,"limbs of each one trembled beneath him, but never once did I see thy"
6380,BOOK XI.,"son’s fair face wax pale, nor did he wipe the tears from his cheeks:"
6381,BOOK XI.,"but he besought me often to let him go forth from the horse, and kept"
6382,BOOK XI.,"handling his sword-hilt, and his heavy bronze-shod spear, and he was"
6383,BOOK XI.,set on mischief against the Trojans. But after we had sacked the steep
6384,BOOK XI.,"city of Priam, he embarked unscathed with his share of the spoil, and"
6385,BOOK XI.,"with a noble prize; he was not smitten with the sharp spear, and got no"
6386,BOOK XI.,"wound in close fight: and many such chances there be in war, for Ares"
6387,BOOK XI.,rageth confusedly.’

6397,BOOK XI.,"and each one asked of those that were dear to them. The soul of Aias,"
6398,BOOK XI.,"son of Telamon, alone stood apart being still angry for the victory"
6399,BOOK XI.,"wherein I prevailed against him, in the suit by the ships concerning"
6400,BOOK XI.,"the arms of Achilles, that his lady mother had set for a prize; and the"
6401,BOOK XI.,sons of the Trojans made award and Pallas Athene. Would that I had
6402,BOOK XI.,never prevailed and won such a prize! So goodly a head hath the earth
6403,BOOK XI.,"closed over, for the sake of those arms, even over Aias, who in beauty"
6404,BOOK XI.,"and in feats of war was of a mould above all the other Danaans, next to"
6405,BOOK XI.,"the noble son of Peleus. To him then I spake softly, saying:"
6406,BOOK XI.,
6407,BOOK XI.,"“‘Aias, son of noble Telamon, so art thou not even in death to forget"
6408,BOOK XI.,"thy wrath against me, by reason of those arms accursed, which the gods"
6409,BOOK XI.,set to be the bane of the Argives? What a tower of strength fell in thy
6410,BOOK XI.,"fall, and we Achaeans cease not to sorrow for thee, even as for the"
6411,BOOK XI.,"life of Achilles, son of Peleus! Nay, there is none other to blame, but"
6412,BOOK XI.,"Zeus, who hath borne wondrous hate to the army of the Danaan spearsmen,"
6413,BOOK XI.,"and laid on thee thy doom. Nay, come hither, my lord, that thou mayest"
6414,BOOK XI.,hear my word and my speech; master thy wrath and thy proud spirit.’
6415,BOOK XI.,
6416,BOOK XI.,"“So I spake, but he answered me not a word and passed to Erebus after"
6417,BOOK XI.,"the other spirits of the dead that be departed. Even then, despite his"
6418,BOOK XI.,"anger, would he have spoken to me or I to him, but my heart within me"
6419,BOOK XI.,was minded to see the spirits of those others that were departed.
6420,BOOK XI.,
6421,BOOK XI.,"“There then I saw Minos, glorious son of Zeus, wielding a golden"
6422,BOOK XI.,"sceptre, giving sentence from his throne to the dead, while they sat"
6423,BOOK XI.,"and stood around the prince, asking his dooms through the wide-gated"
6424,BOOK XI.,house of Hades.
6425,BOOK XI.,
6426,BOOK XI.,“And after him I marked the mighty Orion driving the wild beasts
6427,BOOK XI.,"together over the mead of asphodel, the very beasts that himself had"
6428,BOOK XI.,"slain on the lonely hills, with a strong mace all of bronze in his"
6429,BOOK XI.,"hands,[22] that is ever unbroken."
6430,BOOK XI.,
6431,BOOK XI.,"[22] ἔχων in strict grammar agrees with αὐτὸς in 574, but this merely"
6432,BOOK XI.,"by attraction, for in sense it refers not to the living man, but to"
6433,BOOK XI.,his phantom.
6434,BOOK XI.,
6435,BOOK XI.,
6436,BOOK XI.,"“And I saw Tityos, son of renowned Earth, lying on a levelled ground,"
6437,BOOK XI.,"and he covered nine roods as he lay, and vultures twain beset him one"
6438,BOOK XI.,"on either side, and gnawed at his liver, piercing even to the caul, but"
6439,BOOK XI.,he drave them not away with his hands. For he had dealt violently with
6440,BOOK XI.,"Leto, the famous bedfellow of Zeus, as she went up to Pytho through the"
6441,BOOK XI.,fair lawns of Panopeus.
6442,BOOK XI.,
6443,BOOK XI.,"“Moreover I beheld Tantalus in grievous torment, standing in a mere and"
6444,BOOK XI.,the water came nigh unto his chin. And he stood straining as one
6445,BOOK XI.,"athirst, but he might not attain to the water to drink of it. For often"
6446,BOOK XI.,"as that old man stooped down in his eagerness to drink, so often the"
6447,BOOK XI.,"water was swallowed up and it vanished away, and the black earth still"
6448,BOOK XI.,"showed at his feet, for some god parched it evermore. And tall trees"
6449,BOOK XI.,"flowering shed their fruit overhead, pears and pomegranates and apple"
6450,BOOK XI.,"trees with bright fruit, and sweet figs and olives in their bloom,"
6451,BOOK XI.,"whereat when that old man reached out his hands to clutch them, the"
6452,BOOK XI.,wind would toss them to the shadowy clouds.
6453,BOOK XI.,
6454,BOOK XI.,"“Yea and I beheld Sisyphus in strong torment, grasping a monstrous"
6455,BOOK XI.,"stone with both his hands. He was pressing thereat with hands and feet,"
6456,BOOK XI.,and trying to roll the stone upward toward the brow of the hill. But
6457,BOOK XI.,"oft as he was about to hurl it over the top, the weight would drive him"
6458,BOOK XI.,"back, so once again to the plain rolled the stone, the shameless thing."
6459,BOOK XI.,"And he once more kept heaving and straining, and the sweat the while"
6460,BOOK XI.,"was pouring down his limbs, and the dust rose upwards from his head."
6461,BOOK XI.,
6462,BOOK XI.,"“And after him I descried the mighty Heracles, his phantom, I say; but"
6463,BOOK XI.,"as for himself he hath joy at the banquet among the deathless gods, and"
6464,BOOK XI.,"hath to wife Hebe of the fair ankles, child of great Zeus, and of Here"
6465,BOOK XI.,of the golden sandals. And all about him there was a clamour of the
6466,BOOK XI.,"dead, as it were fowls flying every way in fear, and he like black"
6467,BOOK XI.,"Night, with bow uncased, and shaft upon the string, fiercely glancing"
6468,BOOK XI.,"around, like one in the act to shoot. And about his breast was an awful"
6469,BOOK XI.,"belt, a baldric of gold, whereon wondrous things were wrought, bears"
6470,BOOK XI.,"and wild boars and lions with flashing eyes, and strife and battles and"
6471,BOOK XI.,"slaughters and murders of men. Nay, now that he hath fashioned this,"
6472,BOOK XI.,"never another may he fashion, whoso stored in his craft the device of"
6473,BOOK XI.,"that belt! And anon he knew me when his eyes beheld me, and making"
6474,BOOK XI.,lament he spake unto me winged words:
6475,BOOK XI.,
6476,BOOK XI.,"“‘Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices: ah!"
6477,BOOK XI.,"wretched one, dost thou too lead such a life of evil doom, as I endured"
6478,BOOK XI.,"beneath the rays of the sun? I was the son of Zeus Cronion, yet had I"
6479,BOOK XI.,"trouble beyond measure, for I was subdued unto a man far worse than I."
6480,BOOK XI.,"And he enjoined on me hard adventures, yea and on a time he sent me"
6481,BOOK XI.,hither to bring back the hound of hell; for he devised no harder task
6482,BOOK XI.,for me than this. I lifted the hound and brought him forth from out of
6483,BOOK XI.,the house of Hades; and Hermes sped me on my way and the grey-eyed
6484,BOOK XI.,Athene.’
6485,BOOK XI.,
6486,BOOK XI.,"“Therewith he departed again into the house of Hades, but I abode there"
6487,BOOK XI.,"still, if perchance some one of the hero folk besides might come, who"
6488,BOOK XI.,"died in old time. Yea and I should have seen the men of old, whom I was"
6489,BOOK XI.,"fain to look on, Theseus and Peirithous, renowned children of the gods."
6490,BOOK XI.,But ere that might be the myriad tribes of the dead thronged up
6491,BOOK XI.,"together with wondrous clamour: and pale fear gat hold of me, lest the"
6492,BOOK XI.,"high goddess Persephone should send me the head of the Gorgon, that"
6493,BOOK XI.,"dread monster, from out of Hades."
6494,BOOK XI.,
6495,BOOK XI.,"“Straightway then I went to the ship, and bade my men mount the vessel,"
6496,BOOK XI.,"and loose the hawsers. So speedily they went on board, and sat upon the"
6497,BOOK XI.,benches. And the wave of the flood bore the barque down the stream of
6498,BOOK XI.,"Oceanus, we rowing first, and afterwards the fair wind was our convoy."

6505,BOOK XII.,"Odysseus, his passage by the Sirens, and by Scylla and Charybdis. The"
6506,BOOK XII.,sacrilege committed by his men in the isle Thrinacia. The destruction
6507,BOOK XII.,"of his ships and men. How he swam on a plank nine days together, and"
6508,BOOK XII.,"came to Ogygia, where he stayed seven years with Calypso."
6509,BOOK XII.,
6510,BOOK XII.,
6511,BOOK XII.,"“Now after the ship had left the stream of the river Oceanus, and was"
6512,BOOK XII.,"come to the wave of the wide sea, and the isle Aeaean, where is the"
6513,BOOK XII.,"dwelling place of early Dawn and her dancing grounds, and the land of"
6514,BOOK XII.,"sunrising, upon our coming thither we beached the ship in the sand, and"
6515,BOOK XII.,ourselves too stept ashore on the sea beach. There we fell on sound
6516,BOOK XII.,sleep and awaited the bright Dawn.
6517,BOOK XII.,
6518,BOOK XII.,"“So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, I sent forth my"
6519,BOOK XII.,fellows to the house of Circe to fetch the body of the dead Elpenor.
6520,BOOK XII.,"And speedily we cut billets of wood and sadly we buried him, where the"
6521,BOOK XII.,"furthest headland runs out into the sea, shedding big tears. But when"
6522,BOOK XII.,"the dead man was burned and the arms of the dead, we piled a barrow and"
6523,BOOK XII.,"dragged up thereon a pillar, and on the topmost mound we set the shapen"
6524,BOOK XII.,oar.
6525,BOOK XII.,
6526,BOOK XII.,"“Now all that task we finished, and our coming from out of Hades was"
6527,BOOK XII.,"not unknown to Circe, but she arrayed herself and speedily drew nigh,"
6528,BOOK XII.,and her handmaids with her bare flesh and bread in plenty and dark red
6529,BOOK XII.,"wine. And the fair goddess stood in the midst and spake in our ears,"
6530,BOOK XII.,saying:
6531,BOOK XII.,
6532,BOOK XII.,"“‘Men overbold, who have gone alive into the house of Hades, to know"
6533,BOOK XII.,"death twice, while all men else die once for all. Nay come, eat ye meat"
6534,BOOK XII.,and drink wine here all day long; and with the breaking of the day ye
6535,BOOK XII.,"shall set sail, and myself I will show you the path and declare each"
6536,BOOK XII.,"thing, that ye may not suffer pain or hurt through any grievous"
6537,BOOK XII.,ill-contrivance by sea or on the land.’
6538,BOOK XII.,
6539,BOOK XII.,"“So spake she, and our lordly souls consented thereto. Thus for that"
6540,BOOK XII.,"time we sat the livelong day, until the going down of the sun, feasting"
6541,BOOK XII.,on abundant flesh and on sweet wine. Now when the sun sank and darkness
6542,BOOK XII.,"came on, my company laid them to rest by the hawsers of the ship. Then"
6543,BOOK XII.,"she took me by the hand and led me apart from my dear company, and made"
6544,BOOK XII.,"me to sit down and laid herself at my feet, and asked all my tale. And"
6545,BOOK XII.,I told her all in order duly. Then at the last the Lady Circe spake
6546,BOOK XII.,"unto me, saying:"
6547,BOOK XII.,
6548,BOOK XII.,"“‘Even so, now all these things have an end; do thou then hearken even"
6549,BOOK XII.,"as I tell thee, and the god himself shall bring it back to thy mind. To"
6550,BOOK XII.,"the Sirens first shalt thou come, who bewitch all men, whosoever shall"
6551,BOOK XII.,come to them. Whoso draws nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of
6552,BOOK XII.,"the Sirens’ voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by him on his"
6553,BOOK XII.,"return, nor have they joy at his coming; but the Sirens enchant him"
6554,BOOK XII.,"with their clear song, sitting in the meadow, and all about is a great"
6555,BOOK XII.,"heap of bones of men, corrupt in death, and round the bones the skin is"
6556,BOOK XII.,"wasting. But do thou drive thy ship past, and knead honey-sweet wax,"
6557,BOOK XII.,"and anoint therewith the ears of thy company, lest any of the rest hear"
6558,BOOK XII.,"the song; but if thou myself art minded to hear, let them bind thee in"
6559,BOOK XII.,"the swift ship hand and foot, upright in the mast-stead, and from the"
6560,BOOK XII.,"mast let rope-ends be tied, that with delight thou mayest hear the"
6561,BOOK XII.,voice of the Sirens. And if thou shalt beseech thy company and bid them
6562,BOOK XII.,"to loose thee, then let them bind thee with yet more bonds. But when"
6563,BOOK XII.,"thy friends have driven thy ship past these, I will not tell thee fully"
6564,BOOK XII.,"which path shall thenceforth be thine, but do thou thyself consider it,"
6565,BOOK XII.,and I will speak to thee of either way. On the one side there are
6566,BOOK XII.,"beetling rocks, and against them the great wave roars of dark-eyed"
6567,BOOK XII.,"Amphitrite. These, ye must know, are they the blessed gods call the"
6568,BOOK XII.,"Rocks Wandering. By this way even winged things may never pass, nay,"
6569,BOOK XII.,"not even the cowering doves that bear ambrosia to Father Zeus, but the"
6570,BOOK XII.,"sheer rock evermore takes away one even of these, and the Father sends"
6571,BOOK XII.,in another to make up the tale. Thereby no ship of men ever escapes
6572,BOOK XII.,"that comes thither, but the planks of ships and the bodies of men"
6573,BOOK XII.,confusedly are tossed by the waves of the sea and the storms of ruinous
6574,BOOK XII.,"fire. One ship only of all that fare by sea hath passed that way, even"
6575,BOOK XII.,"Argo, that is in all men’s minds, on her voyage from Aeetes. And even"
6576,BOOK XII.,"her the wave would lightly have cast there upon the mighty rocks, but"
6577,BOOK XII.,Here sent her by for love of Jason.
6578,BOOK XII.,
6579,BOOK XII.,"“‘On the other part are two rocks, whereof the one reaches with sharp"
6580,BOOK XII.,"peak to the wide heaven, and a dark cloud encompasses it; this never"
6581,BOOK XII.,"streams away, and there is no clear air about the peak neither in"
6582,BOOK XII.,summer nor in harvest tide. No mortal man may scale it or set foot
6583,BOOK XII.,"thereon, not though he had twenty hands and feet. For the rock is"
6584,BOOK XII.,"smooth, and sheer, as it were polished. And in the midst of the cliff"
6585,BOOK XII.,"is a dim cave turned to Erebus, towards the place of darkness, whereby"
6586,BOOK XII.,"ye shall even steer your hollow ship, noble Odysseus. Not with an arrow"
6587,BOOK XII.,from a bow might a man in his strength reach from his hollow ship into
6588,BOOK XII.,"that deep cave. And therein dwelleth Scylla, yelping terribly. Her"
6589,BOOK XII.,"voice indeed is no greater than the voice of a new-born whelp, but a"
6590,BOOK XII.,"dreadful monster is she, nor would any look on her gladly, not if it"
6591,BOOK XII.,were a god that met her. Verily she hath twelve feet all dangling down;
6592,BOOK XII.,"and six necks exceeding long, and on each a hideous head, and therein"
6593,BOOK XII.,"three rows of teeth set thick and close, full of black death. Up to her"
6594,BOOK XII.,"middle is she sunk far down in the hollow cave, but forth she holds her"
6595,BOOK XII.,"heads from the dreadful gulf, and there she fishes, swooping round the"
6596,BOOK XII.,"rock, for dolphins or sea-dogs, or whatso greater beast she may"
6597,BOOK XII.,"anywhere take, whereof the deep-voiced Amphitrite feeds countless"
6598,BOOK XII.,flocks. Thereby no sailors boast that they have fled scatheless ever
6599,BOOK XII.,"with their ship, for with each head she carries off a man, whom she"
6600,BOOK XII.,hath snatched from out the dark-prowed ship.
6601,BOOK XII.,
6602,BOOK XII.,"“‘But that other cliff, Odysseus, thou shalt note, lying lower, hard by"
6603,BOOK XII.,the first: thou couldest send an arrow across. And thereon is a great
6604,BOOK XII.,"fig-tree growing, in fullest leaf, and beneath it mighty Charybdis"
6605,BOOK XII.,"sucks down black water, for thrice a day she spouts it forth, and"
6606,BOOK XII.,thrice a day she sucks it down in terrible wise. Never mayest thou be
6607,BOOK XII.,"there when she sucks the water, for none might save thee then from thy"
6608,BOOK XII.,"bane, not even the Earth-Shaker! But take heed and swiftly drawing nigh"
6609,BOOK XII.,"to Scylla’s rock drive the ship past, since of a truth it is far better"
6610,BOOK XII.,"to mourn six of thy company in the ship, than all in the selfsame"
6611,BOOK XII.,hour.’
6612,BOOK XII.,
6613,BOOK XII.,"“So spake she, but I answered, and said unto her: ‘Come I pray thee"
6614,BOOK XII.,"herein, goddess, tell me true, if there be any means whereby I might"
6615,BOOK XII.,"escape from the deadly Charybdis and avenge me on that other, when she"
6616,BOOK XII.,would prey upon my company.’
6617,BOOK XII.,
6618,BOOK XII.,"“So spake I, and that fair goddess answered me: ‘Man overbold, lo, now"
6619,BOOK XII.,again the deeds of war are in thy mind and the travail thereof. Wilt
6620,BOOK XII.,"thou not yield thee even to the deathless gods? As for her, she is no"
6621,BOOK XII.,"mortal, but an immortal plague, dread, grievous, and fierce, and not to"
6622,BOOK XII.,be fought with; and against her there is no defence; flight is the
6623,BOOK XII.,"bravest way. For if thou tarry to do on thine armour by the cliff, I"
6624,BOOK XII.,fear lest once again she sally forth and catch at thee with so many
6625,BOOK XII.,"heads, and seize as many men as before. So drive past with all thy"
6626,BOOK XII.,"force, and call on Cratais, mother of Scylla, which bore her for a bane"
6627,BOOK XII.,to mortals. And she will then let her from darting forth thereafter.
6628,BOOK XII.,
6629,BOOK XII.,“‘Then thou shalt come unto the isle Thrinacia; there are the many kine
6630,BOOK XII.,"of Helios and his brave flocks feeding, seven herds of kine and as many"
6631,BOOK XII.,"goodly flocks of sheep, and fifty in each flock. They have no part in"
6632,BOOK XII.,"birth or in corruption, and there are goddesses to shepherd them,"
6633,BOOK XII.,"nymphs with fair tresses, Phaethusa and Lampetie whom bright Neaera"
6634,BOOK XII.,bare to Helios Hyperion. Now when the lady their mother had borne and
6635,BOOK XII.,"nursed them, she carried them to the isle Thrinacia to dwell afar, that"
6636,BOOK XII.,they should guard their father’s flocks and his kine with shambling
6637,BOOK XII.,"gait. If thou doest these no hurt, being heedful of thy return, truly"
6638,BOOK XII.,"ye may even yet reach Ithaca, albeit in evil case. But if thou hurtest"
6639,BOOK XII.,"them, I foreshow ruin for thy ship and for thy men, and even though"
6640,BOOK XII.,"thou shouldest thyself escape, late shalt thou return in evil plight"
6641,BOOK XII.,with the loss of all thy company.’
6642,BOOK XII.,
6643,BOOK XII.,"“So spake she, and anon came the golden-throned Dawn. Then the fair"
6644,BOOK XII.,goddess took her way up the island. But I departed to my ship and
6645,BOOK XII.,roused my men themselves to mount the vessel and loose the hawsers. And
6646,BOOK XII.,"speedily they went aboard and sat upon the benches, and sitting orderly"
6647,BOOK XII.,smote the grey sea water with their oars. And in the wake of our
6648,BOOK XII.,"dark-prowed ship she sent a favouring wind that filled the sails, a"
6649,BOOK XII.,"kindly escort,—even Circe of the braided tresses, a dread goddess of"
6650,BOOK XII.,human speech. And straightway we set in order the gear throughout the
6651,BOOK XII.,"ship and sat us down, and the wind and the helmsman guided our barque."
6652,BOOK XII.,
6653,BOOK XII.,"“Then I spake among my company with a heavy heart: ‘Friends, forasmuch"
6654,BOOK XII.,as it is not well that one or two alone should know of the oracles that
6655,BOOK XII.,"Circe, the fair goddess, spake unto me, therefore will I declare them,"
6656,BOOK XII.,"that with foreknowledge we may die, or haply shunning death and destiny"
6657,BOOK XII.,escape. First she bade us avoid the sound of the voice of the wondrous
6658,BOOK XII.,"Sirens, and their field of flowers, and me only she bade listen to"
6659,BOOK XII.,"their voices. So bind ye me in a hard bond, that I may abide unmoved in"
6660,BOOK XII.,"my place, upright in the mast-stead, and from the mast let rope-ends be"
6661,BOOK XII.,"tied, and if I beseech and bid you to set me free, then do ye straiten"
6662,BOOK XII.,me with yet more bonds.’
6663,BOOK XII.,
6664,BOOK XII.,"“Thus I rehearsed these things one and all, and declared them to my"
6665,BOOK XII.,company. Meanwhile our good ship quickly came to the island of the
6666,BOOK XII.,"Sirens twain, for a gentle breeze sped her on her way. Then straightway"
6667,BOOK XII.,"the wind ceased, and lo, there was a windless calm, and some god lulled"
6668,BOOK XII.,"the waves. Then my company rose up and drew in the ship’s sails, and"
6669,BOOK XII.,"stowed them in the hold of the ship, while they sat at the oars and"
6670,BOOK XII.,whitened the water with their polished pine blades. But I with my sharp
6671,BOOK XII.,"sword cleft in pieces a great circle of wax, and with my strong hands"
6672,BOOK XII.,"kneaded it. And soon the wax grew warm, for that my great might"
6673,BOOK XII.,"constrained it, and the beam of the lord Helios, son of Hyperion. And I"
6674,BOOK XII.,"anointed therewith the ears of all my men in their order, and in the"
6675,BOOK XII.,"ship they bound me hand and foot upright in the mast-stead, and from"
6676,BOOK XII.,"the mast they fastened rope-ends and themselves sat down, and smote the"
6677,BOOK XII.,grey sea water with their oars. But when the ship was within the sound
6678,BOOK XII.,"of a man’s shout from the land, we fleeing swiftly on our way, the"
6679,BOOK XII.,"Sirens espied the swift ship speeding toward them, and they raised"
6680,BOOK XII.,their clear-toned song:
6681,BOOK XII.,
6682,BOOK XII.,"“‘Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans,"
6683,BOOK XII.,"here stay thy barque, that thou mayest listen to the voice of us twain."
6684,BOOK XII.,"For none hath ever driven by this way in his black ship, till he hath"
6685,BOOK XII.,"heard from our lips the voice sweet as the honeycomb, and hath had joy"
6686,BOOK XII.,"thereof and gone on his way the wiser. For lo, we know all things, all"
6687,BOOK XII.,the travail that in wide Troy-land the Argives and Trojans bare by the
6688,BOOK XII.,"gods’ designs, yea, and we know all that shall hereafter be upon the"
6689,BOOK XII.,fruitful earth.’
6690,BOOK XII.,
6691,BOOK XII.,"“So spake they uttering a sweet voice, and my heart was fain to listen,"
6692,BOOK XII.,"and I bade my company unbind me, nodding at them with a frown, but they"
6693,BOOK XII.,bent to their oars and rowed on. Then straight uprose Perimedes and
6694,BOOK XII.,Eurylochus and bound me with more cords and straitened me yet the more.
6695,BOOK XII.,"Now when we had driven past them, nor heard we any longer the sound of"
6696,BOOK XII.,"the Sirens or their song, forthwith my dear company took away the wax"
6697,BOOK XII.,wherewith I had anointed their ears and loosed me from my bonds.
6698,BOOK XII.,
6699,BOOK XII.,"“But so soon as we left that isle, thereafter presently I saw smoke and"
6700,BOOK XII.,"a great wave, and heard the sea roaring. Then for very fear the oars"
6701,BOOK XII.,"flew from their hands, and down the stream they all splashed, and the"
6702,BOOK XII.,"ship was holden there, for my company no longer plied with their hands"
6703,BOOK XII.,"the tapering oars. But I paced the ship and cheered on my men, as I"
6704,BOOK XII.,stood by each one and spake smooth words:
6705,BOOK XII.,
6706,BOOK XII.,"“‘Friends, forasmuch as in sorrow we are not all unlearned, truly this"
6707,BOOK XII.,"is no greater woe that is upon us,[23] than when the Cyclops penned us"
6708,BOOK XII.,by main might in his hollow cave; yet even thence we made escape by my
6709,BOOK XII.,"manfulness, even by my counsel and my wit, and some day I think that"
6710,BOOK XII.,"this adventure too we shall remember. Come now, therefore, let us all"
6711,BOOK XII.,give ear to do according to my word. Do ye smite the deep surf of the
6712,BOOK XII.,"sea with your oars, as ye sit on the benches, if peradventure Zeus may"
6713,BOOK XII.,"grant us to escape from and shun this death. And as for thee, helmsman,"
6714,BOOK XII.,"thus I charge thee, and ponder it in thine heart seeing that thou"
6715,BOOK XII.,wieldest the helm of the hollow ship. Keep the ship well away from this
6716,BOOK XII.,"smoke and from the wave and hug the rocks, lest the ship, ere thou art"
6717,BOOK XII.,"aware, start from her course to the other side, and so thou hurl us"
6718,BOOK XII.,into ruin.’
6719,BOOK XII.,
6720,BOOK XII.,"[23] Reading ἐπὶ, not ἔπει with La Roche."
6721,BOOK XII.,
6722,BOOK XII.,
6723,BOOK XII.,"“So I spake, and quickly they hearkened to my words. But of Scylla I"
6724,BOOK XII.,"told them nothing more, a bane none might deal with, lest haply my"
6725,BOOK XII.,"company should cease from rowing for fear, and hide them in the hold."
6726,BOOK XII.,"In that same hour I suffered myself to forget the hard behest of Circe,"
6727,BOOK XII.,in that she bade me in nowise be armed; but I did on my glorious
6728,BOOK XII.,"harness and caught up two long lances in my hands, and went on the"
6729,BOOK XII.,"decking of the prow, for thence methought that Scylla of the rock would"
6730,BOOK XII.,"first be seen, who was to bring woe on my company. Yet could I not spy"
6731,BOOK XII.,"her anywhere, and my eyes waxed weary for gazing all about toward the"
6732,BOOK XII.,darkness of the rock.
6733,BOOK XII.,
6734,BOOK XII.,“Next we began to sail up the narrow strait lamenting. For on the one
6735,BOOK XII.,"hand lay Scylla, and on the other mighty Charybdis in terrible wise"
6736,BOOK XII.,"sucked down the salt sea water. As often as she belched it forth, like"
6737,BOOK XII.,a cauldron on a great fire she would seethe up through all her troubled
6738,BOOK XII.,"deeps, and overhead the spray fell on the tops of either cliff. But oft"
6739,BOOK XII.,"as she gulped down the salt sea water, within she was all plain to see"
6740,BOOK XII.,"through her troubled deeps, and the rock around roared horribly and"
6741,BOOK XII.,"beneath the earth was manifest swart with sand, and pale fear gat hold"
6742,BOOK XII.,"on my men. Toward her, then, we looked fearing destruction; but Scylla"
6743,BOOK XII.,"meanwhile caught from out my hollow ship six of my company, the"
6744,BOOK XII.,hardiest of their hands and the chief in might. And looking into the
6745,BOOK XII.,"swift ship to find my men, even then I marked their feet and hands as"
6746,BOOK XII.,"they were lifted on high, and they cried aloud in their agony, and"
6747,BOOK XII.,called me by my name for that last time of all. Even as when as fisher
6748,BOOK XII.,on some headland lets down with a long rod his baits for a snare to the
6749,BOOK XII.,"little fishes below, casting into the deep the horn of an ox of the"
6750,BOOK XII.,"homestead, and as he catches each flings it writhing ashore, so"
6751,BOOK XII.,writhing were they borne upward to the cliff. And there she devoured
6752,BOOK XII.,"them shrieking in her gates, they stretching forth their hands to me in"
6753,BOOK XII.,the dread death-struggle. And the most pitiful thing was this that mine
6754,BOOK XII.,eyes have seen of all my travail in searching out the paths of the sea.
6755,BOOK XII.,
6756,BOOK XII.,"“Now when we had escaped the Rocks and dread Charybdis and Scylla,"
6757,BOOK XII.,thereafter we soon came to the fair island of the god; where were the
6758,BOOK XII.,"goodly kine, broad of brow, and the many brave flocks of Helios"
6759,BOOK XII.,"Hyperion. Then while as yet I was in my black ship upon the deep, I"
6760,BOOK XII.,heard the lowing of the cattle being stalled and the bleating of the
6761,BOOK XII.,"sheep, and on my mind there fell the saying of the blind seer, Theban"
6762,BOOK XII.,"Teiresias, and of Circe of Aia, who charged me very straitly to shun"
6763,BOOK XII.,"the isle of Helios, the gladdener of the world. Then I spake out among"
6764,BOOK XII.,my company in sorrow of heart:
6765,BOOK XII.,
6766,BOOK XII.,"“‘Hear my words, my men, albeit in evil plight, that I may declare unto"
6767,BOOK XII.,"you the oracles of Teiresias and of Circe of Aia, who very straitly"
6768,BOOK XII.,"charged me to shun the isle of Helios, the gladdener of the world. For"
6769,BOOK XII.,"there she said the most dreadful mischief would befal us. Nay, drive ye"
6770,BOOK XII.,then the black ship beyond and past that isle.’
6771,BOOK XII.,
6772,BOOK XII.,"“So spake I, and their heart was broken within them. And Eurylochus"
6773,BOOK XII.,"straightway answered me sadly, saying:"
6774,BOOK XII.,
6775,BOOK XII.,"“‘Hardy art thou, Odysseus, of might beyond measure, and thy limbs are"
6776,BOOK XII.,"never weary; verily thou art fashioned all of iron, that sufferest not"
6777,BOOK XII.,"thy fellows, foredone with toil and drowsiness, to set foot on shore,"
6778,BOOK XII.,where we might presently prepare us a good supper in this sea-girt
6779,BOOK XII.,island. But even as we are thou biddest us fare blindly through the
6780,BOOK XII.,"sudden night, and from the isle go wandering on the misty deep. And"
6781,BOOK XII.,"strong winds, the bane of ships, are born of the night. How could a man"
6782,BOOK XII.,"escape from utter doom, if there chanced to come a sudden blast of the"
6783,BOOK XII.,"South Wind, or of the boisterous West, which mainly wreck ships, beyond"
6784,BOOK XII.,"the will of the gods, the lords of all? Howbeit for this present let us"
6785,BOOK XII.,"yield to the black night, and we will make ready our supper abiding by"
6786,BOOK XII.,"the swift ship, and in the morning we will climb on board, and put out"
6787,BOOK XII.,into the broad deep.’
6788,BOOK XII.,
6789,BOOK XII.,"“So spake Eurylochus, and the rest of my company consented thereto."
6790,BOOK XII.,"Then at the last I knew that some god was indeed imagining evil, and I"
6791,BOOK XII.,uttered my voice and spake unto him winged words:
6792,BOOK XII.,
6793,BOOK XII.,"“‘Eurylochus, verily ye put force upon me, being but one among you all."
6794,BOOK XII.,"But come, swear me now a mighty oath, one and all, to the intent that"
6795,BOOK XII.,"if we light on a herd of kine or a great flock of sheep, none in the"
6796,BOOK XII.,evil folly of his heart may slay any sheep or ox; but in quiet eat ye
6797,BOOK XII.,the meat which the deathless Circe gave.’
6798,BOOK XII.,
6799,BOOK XII.,"“So I spake, and straightway they swore to refrain as I commanded them."
6800,BOOK XII.,"Now after they had sworn and done that oath, we stayed our well-builded"
6801,BOOK XII.,"ship in the hollow harbour near to a well of sweet water, and my"
6802,BOOK XII.,company went forth from out the ship and deftly got ready supper. But
6803,BOOK XII.,"when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink, thereafter"
6804,BOOK XII.,they fell a weeping as they thought upon their dear companions whom
6805,BOOK XII.,Scylla had snatched from out the hollow ship and so devoured. And deep
6806,BOOK XII.,sleep came upon them amid their weeping. And when it was the third
6807,BOOK XII.,"watch of the night, and the stars had crossed the zenith, Zeus the"
6808,BOOK XII.,"cloud-gatherer roused against them an angry wind with wondrous tempest,"
6809,BOOK XII.,"and shrouded in clouds land and sea alike, and from heaven sped down"
6810,BOOK XII.,"the night. Now when early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, we"
6811,BOOK XII.,"beached the ship, and dragged it up within a hollow cave, where were"
6812,BOOK XII.,the fair dancing grounds of the nymphs and the places of their session.
6813,BOOK XII.,"Thereupon I ordered a gathering of my men and spake in their midst,"
6814,BOOK XII.,saying:
6815,BOOK XII.,
6816,BOOK XII.,"“‘Friends, forasmuch as there is yet meat and drink in the swift ship,"
6817,BOOK XII.,"let us keep our hands off those kine, lest some evil thing befal us."
6818,BOOK XII.,"For these are the kine and the brave flocks of a dread god, even of"
6819,BOOK XII.,"Helios, who overseeth all and overheareth all things.’"
6820,BOOK XII.,
6821,BOOK XII.,"“So I spake, and their lordly spirit hearkened thereto. Then for a"
6822,BOOK XII.,"whole month the South Wind blew without ceasing, and no other wind"
6823,BOOK XII.,"arose, save only the East and the South."
6824,BOOK XII.,
6825,BOOK XII.,"“Now so long as my company still had corn and red wine, they refrained"
6826,BOOK XII.,"them from the kine, for they were fain of life. But when the corn was"
6827,BOOK XII.,"now all spent from out the ship, and they went wandering with barbed"
6828,BOOK XII.,"hooks in quest of game, as needs they must, fishes and fowls,"
6829,BOOK XII.,"whatsoever might come to their hand, for hunger gnawed at their belly,"
6830,BOOK XII.,"then at last I departed up the isle, that I might pray to the gods, if"
6831,BOOK XII.,perchance some one of them might show me a way of returning. And now
6832,BOOK XII.,"when I had avoided my company on my way through the island, I laved my"
6833,BOOK XII.,"hands where was a shelter from the wind, and prayed to all the gods"
6834,BOOK XII.,that hold Olympus. But they shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids. And
6835,BOOK XII.,Eurylochus the while set forth an evil counsel to my company:
6836,BOOK XII.,
6837,BOOK XII.,"“‘Hear my words, my friends, though ye be in evil case. Truly every"
6838,BOOK XII.,"shape of death is hateful to wretched mortals, but to die of hunger and"
6839,BOOK XII.,"so meet doom is most pitiful of all. Nay come, we will drive off the"
6840,BOOK XII.,best of the kine of Helios and will do sacrifice to the deathless gods
6841,BOOK XII.,"who keep wide heaven. And if we may yet reach Ithaca, our own country,"
6842,BOOK XII.,"forthwith will we rear a rich shrine to Helios Hyperion, and therein"
6843,BOOK XII.,would we set many a choice offering. But if he be somewhat wroth for
6844,BOOK XII.,"his cattle with straight horns, and is fain to wreck our ship, and the"
6845,BOOK XII.,"other gods follow his desire, rather with one gulp at the wave would I"
6846,BOOK XII.,"cast my life away, than be slowly straitened to death in a desert"
6847,BOOK XII.,isle.’
6848,BOOK XII.,
6849,BOOK XII.,"“So spake Eurylochus, and the rest of the company consented thereto."
6850,BOOK XII.,Forthwith they drave off the best of the kine of Helios that were nigh
6851,BOOK XII.,"at hand, for the fair kine of shambling gait and broad of brow were"
6852,BOOK XII.,feeding no great way from the dark-prowed ship. Then they stood around
6853,BOOK XII.,"the cattle and prayed to the gods, plucking the fresh leaves from an"
6854,BOOK XII.,"oak of lofty boughs, for they had no white barley on board the decked"
6855,BOOK XII.,ship. Now after they had prayed and cut the throats of the kine and
6856,BOOK XII.,"flayed them, they cut out slices of the thighs and wrapped them in the"
6857,BOOK XII.,"fat, making a double fold, and thereon they laid raw flesh. Yet had"
6858,BOOK XII.,"they no pure wine to pour over the flaming sacrifices, but they made"
6859,BOOK XII.,libation with water and roasted the entrails over the fire. Now after
6860,BOOK XII.,"the thighs were quite consumed and they had tasted the inner parts,"
6861,BOOK XII.,they cut the rest up small and spitted it on spits. In the same hour
6862,BOOK XII.,deep sleep sped from my eyelids and I sallied forth to the swift ship
6863,BOOK XII.,"and the sea-banks. But on my way as I drew near to the curved ship, the"
6864,BOOK XII.,sweet savour of the fat came all about me; and I groaned and spake out
6865,BOOK XII.,before the deathless gods:
6866,BOOK XII.,
6867,BOOK XII.,"“‘Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for ever, verily"
6868,BOOK XII.,"to my undoing ye have lulled me with a ruthless sleep, and my company"
6869,BOOK XII.,abiding behind have imagined a monstrous deed.’
6870,BOOK XII.,
6871,BOOK XII.,"“Then swiftly to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long robes, with"
6872,BOOK XII.,the tidings that we had slain his kine. And straight he spake with
6873,BOOK XII.,angry heart amid the Immortals:
6874,BOOK XII.,
6875,BOOK XII.,"“‘Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for ever, take"
6876,BOOK XII.,"vengeance I pray you on the company of Odysseus, son of Laertes, that"
6877,BOOK XII.,"have insolently slain my cattle, wherein I was wont to be glad as I"
6878,BOOK XII.,"went toward the starry heaven, and when I again turned earthward from"
6879,BOOK XII.,"the firmament. And if they pay me not full atonement for the cattle, I"
6880,BOOK XII.,will go down to Hades and shine among the dead.’
6881,BOOK XII.,
6882,BOOK XII.,"“And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered him, saying: ‘Helios, do thou, I"
6883,BOOK XII.,"say, shine on amidst the deathless gods, and amid mortal men upon the"
6884,BOOK XII.,"earth, the grain-giver. But as for me, I will soon smite their swift"
6885,BOOK XII.,"ship with my white bolt, and cleave it in pieces in the midst of the"
6886,BOOK XII.,wine-dark deep.’
6887,BOOK XII.,
6888,BOOK XII.,“This I heard from Calypso of the fair hair; and she said that she
6889,BOOK XII.,herself had heard it from Hermes the Messenger.
6890,BOOK XII.,
6891,BOOK XII.,"“But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea, I went up to my"
6892,BOOK XII.,"companions and rebuked them one by one; but we could find no remedy,"
6893,BOOK XII.,the cattle were dead and gone. And soon thereafter the gods showed
6894,BOOK XII.,"forth signs and wonders to my company. The skins were creeping, and the"
6895,BOOK XII.,"flesh bellowing upon the spits, both the roast and raw, and there was a"
6896,BOOK XII.,sound as the voice of kine.
6897,BOOK XII.,
6898,BOOK XII.,“Then for six days my dear company feasted on the best of the kine of
6899,BOOK XII.,"Helios which they had driven off. But when Zeus, son of Cronos, had"
6900,BOOK XII.,"added the seventh day thereto, thereafter the wind ceased to blow with"
6901,BOOK XII.,"a rushing storm, and at once we climbed the ship and launched into the"
6902,BOOK XII.,"broad deep, when we had set up the mast and hoisted the white sails."
6903,BOOK XII.,
6904,BOOK XII.,"“But now when we left that isle nor any other land appeared, but sky"
6905,BOOK XII.,"and sea only, even then the son of Cronos stayed a dark cloud above the"
6906,BOOK XII.,"hollow ship, and beneath it the deep darkened. And the ship ran on her"
6907,BOOK XII.,"way for no long while, for of a sudden came the shrilling West, with"
6908,BOOK XII.,"the rushing of a great tempest, and the blast of wind snapped the two"
6909,BOOK XII.,"forestays of the mast, and the mast fell backward and all the gear"
6910,BOOK XII.,"dropped into the bilge. And behold, on the hind part of the ship the"
6911,BOOK XII.,mast struck the head of the pilot and brake all the bones of his skull
6912,BOOK XII.,"together, and like a diver he dropt down from the deck, and his brave"
6913,BOOK XII.,spirit left his bones. In that same hour Zeus thundered and cast his
6914,BOOK XII.,"bolt upon the ship, and she reeled all over being stricken by the bolt"
6915,BOOK XII.,"of Zeus, and was filled with sulphur, and lo, my company fell from out"
6916,BOOK XII.,the vessel. Like sea-gulls they were borne round the black ship upon
6917,BOOK XII.,"the billows, and the god reft them of returning."
6918,BOOK XII.,
6919,BOOK XII.,"“But I kept pacing through my ship, till the surge loosened the sides"
6920,BOOK XII.,"from the keel, and the wave swept her along stript of her tackling, and"
6921,BOOK XII.,brake her mast clean off at the keel. Now the backstay fashioned of an
6922,BOOK XII.,oxhide had been flung thereon; therewith I lashed together both keel
6923,BOOK XII.,"and mast, and sitting thereon I was borne by the ruinous winds."
6924,BOOK XII.,
6925,BOOK XII.,"“Then verily the West Wind ceased to blow with a rushing storm, and"
6926,BOOK XII.,"swiftly withal the South Wind came, bringing sorrow to my soul, that so"
6927,BOOK XII.,"I might again measure back that space of sea, the way to deadly"
6928,BOOK XII.,"Charybdis. All the night was I borne, but with the rising of the sun I"
6929,BOOK XII.,"came to the rock of Scylla, and to dread Charybdis. Now she had sucked"
6930,BOOK XII.,"down her salt sea water, when I was swung up on high to the tall"
6931,BOOK XII.,"fig-tree whereto I clung like a bat, and could find no sure rest for my"
6932,BOOK XII.,"feet nor place to stand, for the roots spread far below and the"
6933,BOOK XII.,"branches hung aloft out of reach, long and large, and overshadowed"
6934,BOOK XII.,Charybdis. Steadfast I clung till she should spew forth mast and keel
6935,BOOK XII.,again; and late they came to my desire. At the hour when a man rises up
6936,BOOK XII.,"from the assembly and goes to supper, one who judges the many quarrels"
6937,BOOK XII.,"of the young men that seek to him for law, at that same hour those"
6938,BOOK XII.,timbers came forth to view from out Charybdis. And I let myself drop
6939,BOOK XII.,"down hands and feet, and plunged heavily in the midst of the waters"
6940,BOOK XII.,"beyond the long timbers, and sitting on these I rowed hard with my"
6941,BOOK XII.,hands. But the father of gods and of men suffered me no more to behold
6942,BOOK XII.,"Scylla, else I should never have escaped from utter doom."
6943,BOOK XII.,
6944,BOOK XII.,"“Thence for nine days was I borne, and on the tenth night the gods"
6945,BOOK XII.,"brought me nigh to the isle of Ogygia, where dwells Calypso of the"
6946,BOOK XII.,"braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, who took me in and"
6947,BOOK XII.,entreated me kindly. But why rehearse all this tale? For even yesterday
6948,BOOK XII.,I told it to thee and to thy noble wife in thy house; and it liketh me
6949,BOOK XII.,not twice to tell a plain-told tale.”
6950,BOOK XII.,
6951,BOOK XII.,
6952,BOOK XII.,
6953,BOOK XIII.,BOOK XIII.
6954,BOOK XIII.,
6955,BOOK XIII.,
6956,BOOK XIII.,"Odysseus, sleeping, is set ashore at Ithaca by the Phaeacians, and"
6957,BOOK XIII.,"waking knows it not. Pallas, in the form of a shepherd, helps to hide"
6958,BOOK XIII.,"his treasure. The ship that conveyed him is turned into a rock, and"
6959,BOOK XIII.,"Odysseus by Pallas is instructed what to do, and transformed into an"
6960,BOOK XIII.,old beggarman.
6961,BOOK XIII.,
6962,BOOK XIII.,
6963,BOOK XIII.,"So spake he, and dead silence fell on all, and they were spell-bound"
6964,BOOK XIII.,"throughout the shadowy halls. Thereupon Alcinous answered him, and"
6965,BOOK XIII.,"spake, saying:"
6966,BOOK XIII.,
6967,BOOK XIII.,"“Odysseus, now that thou hast come to my high house with floor of"
6968,BOOK XIII.,"bronze, never, methinks, shalt thou be driven from thy way ere thou"
6969,BOOK XIII.,"returnest, though thou hast been sore afflicted. And for each man among"
6970,BOOK XIII.,"you, that in these halls of mine drink evermore the dark wine of the"
6971,BOOK XIII.,"elders, and hearken to the minstrel, this is my word and command."
6972,BOOK XIII.,"Garments for the stranger are already laid up in a polished coffer,"
6973,BOOK XIII.,"with gold curiously wrought, and all other such gifts as the"
6974,BOOK XIII.,"counsellors of the Phaeacians bare hither. Come now, let us each of us"
6975,BOOK XIII.,"give him a great tripod and a cauldron, and we in turn will gather"
6976,BOOK XIII.,goods among the people and get us recompense; for it were hard that one
6977,BOOK XIII.,man should give without repayment.”
6978,BOOK XIII.,
6979,BOOK XIII.,"So spake Alcinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then they went"
6980,BOOK XIII.,each one to his house to lay him down to rest; but so soon as early
6981,BOOK XIII.,"Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, they hasted to the ship and bare"
6982,BOOK XIII.,"the bronze, the joy of men. And the mighty king Alcinous himself went"
6983,BOOK XIII.,"about the ship and diligently bestowed the gifts beneath the benches,"
6984,BOOK XIII.,"that they might not hinder any of the crew in their rowing, when they"
6985,BOOK XIII.,laboured at their oars. Then they betook them to the house of Alcinous
6986,BOOK XIII.,and fell to feasting. And the mighty king Alcinous sacrificed before
6987,BOOK XIII.,"them an ox to Zeus, the son of Cronos, that dwells in the dark clouds,"
6988,BOOK XIII.,"who is lord of all. And when they had burnt the pieces of the thighs,"
6989,BOOK XIII.,"they shared the glorious feast and made merry, and among them harped"
6990,BOOK XIII.,"the divine minstrel Demodocus, whom the people honoured. But Odysseus"
6991,BOOK XIII.,"would ever turn his head toward the splendour of the sun, as one fain"
6992,BOOK XIII.,to hasten his setting: for verily he was most eager to return. And as
6993,BOOK XIII.,"when a man longs for his supper, for whom all day long two dark oxen"
6994,BOOK XIII.,"drag through the fallow field the jointed plough, yea and welcome to"
6995,BOOK XIII.,"such an one the sunlight sinketh, that so he may get him to supper, for"
6996,BOOK XIII.,"his knees wax faint by the way, even so welcome was the sinking of the"
6997,BOOK XIII.,"sunlight to Odysseus. Then straight he spake among the Phaeacians,"
6998,BOOK XIII.,"masters of the oar, and to Alcinous in chief he made known his word,"
6999,BOOK XIII.,saying:
7000,BOOK XIII.,
7001,BOOK XIII.,"“My lord Alcinous, most notable of all the people, pour ye the drink"
7002,BOOK XIII.,"offering, and send me safe upon my way, and as for you, fare ye well."
7003,BOOK XIII.,"For now have I all that my heart desired, an escort and loving gifts."
7004,BOOK XIII.,"May the gods of heaven give me good fortune with them, and may I find"
7005,BOOK XIII.,"my noble wife in my home with my friends unharmed, while ye, for your"
7006,BOOK XIII.,"part, abide here and make glad your wedded wives and children; and may"
7007,BOOK XIII.,"the gods vouchsafe all manner of good, and may no evil come nigh the"
7008,BOOK XIII.,people!”
7009,BOOK XIII.,
7010,BOOK XIII.,"So spake he, and they all consented thereto and bade send the stranger"
7011,BOOK XIII.,"on his way, in that he had spoken aright. Then the mighty Alcinous"
7012,BOOK XIII.,"spake to the henchman: “Pontonous, mix the bowl and serve out the wine"
7013,BOOK XIII.,"to all in the hall, that we may pray to Father Zeus, and send the"
7014,BOOK XIII.,stranger on his way to his own country.”
7015,BOOK XIII.,
7016,BOOK XIII.,"So spake he, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine, and served it"
7017,BOOK XIII.,to all in turn. And they poured forth before the blessed gods that keep
7018,BOOK XIII.,"wide heaven, even there as they sat. Then goodly Odysseus uprose, and"
7019,BOOK XIII.,"placed in Arete’s hand the two-handled cup, and uttering his voice"
7020,BOOK XIII.,spake to her winged words:
7021,BOOK XIII.,
7022,BOOK XIII.,"“Fare thee well, O queen, all the days of thy life, till old age come"
7023,BOOK XIII.,"and death, that visit all mankind. But I go homeward, and do thou in"
7024,BOOK XIII.,this thy house rejoice in thy children and thy people and Alcinous the
7025,BOOK XIII.,king.”
7026,BOOK XIII.,
7027,BOOK XIII.,Therewith goodly Odysseus stept over the threshold. And with him the
7028,BOOK XIII.,mighty Alcinous sent forth a henchman to guide him to the swift ship
7029,BOOK XIII.,and the sea-banks. And Arete sent in this train certain maidens of her
7030,BOOK XIII.,"household, one bearing a fresh robe and a doublet, and another she"
7031,BOOK XIII.,"joined to them to carry the strong coffer, and yet another bare bread"
7032,BOOK XIII.,"and red wine. Now when they had come down to the ship and to the sea,"
7033,BOOK XIII.,straightway the good men of the escort took these things and laid them
7034,BOOK XIII.,"by in the hollow ship, even all the meat and drink. Then they strewed"
7035,BOOK XIII.,"for Odysseus a rug and a sheet of linen, on the decks of the hollow"
7036,BOOK XIII.,"ship, in the hinder part thereof, that he might sleep sound. Then he"
7037,BOOK XIII.,"too climbed aboard and laid him down in silence, while they sat upon"
7038,BOOK XIII.,"the benches, every man in order, and unbound the hawser from the"
7039,BOOK XIII.,pierced stone. So soon as they leant backwards and tossed the sea water
7040,BOOK XIII.,"with the oar blade, a deep sleep fell upon his eyelids, a sound sleep,"
7041,BOOK XIII.,"very sweet, and next akin to death. And even as on a plain a yoke of"
7042,BOOK XIII.,"four stallions comes springing all together beneath the lash, leaping"
7043,BOOK XIII.,"high and speedily accomplishing the way, so leaped the stern of that"
7044,BOOK XIII.,"ship, and the dark wave of the sounding sea rushed mightily in the"
7045,BOOK XIII.,"wake, and she ran ever surely on her way, nor could a circling hawk"
7046,BOOK XIII.,"keep pace with her, of winged things the swiftest. Even thus she"
7047,BOOK XIII.,"lightly sped and cleft the waves of the sea, bearing a man whose"
7048,BOOK XIII.,"counsel was as the counsel of the gods, one that erewhile had suffered"
7049,BOOK XIII.,"much sorrow of heart, in passing through the wars of men, and the"
7050,BOOK XIII.,"grievous waves; but for that time he slept in peace, forgetful of all"
7051,BOOK XIII.,that he had suffered.
7052,BOOK XIII.,
7053,BOOK XIII.,"So when the star came up, that is brightest of all, and goes ever"
7054,BOOK XIII.,"heralding the light of early Dawn, even then did the seafaring ship"
7055,BOOK XIII.,draw nigh the island. There is in the land of Ithaca a certain haven of
7056,BOOK XIII.,"Phorcys, the ancient one of the sea, and thereby are two headlands of"
7057,BOOK XIII.,"sheer cliff, which slope to the sea on the haven’s side and break the"
7058,BOOK XIII.,"mighty wave that ill winds roll without, but within, the decked ships"
7059,BOOK XIII.,ride unmoored when once they have reached the place of anchorage. Now
7060,BOOK XIII.,"at the harbour’s head is a long-leaved olive tree, and hard by is a"
7061,BOOK XIII.,"pleasant cave and shadowy, sacred to the nymphs, that are called the"
7062,BOOK XIII.,"Naiads. And therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone, and there"
7063,BOOK XIII.,"moreover do bees hive. And there are great looms of stone, whereon the"
7064,BOOK XIII.,"nymphs weave raiment of purple stain, a marvel to behold, and therein"
7065,BOOK XIII.,"are waters welling evermore. Two gates there are to the cave, the one"
7066,BOOK XIII.,"set toward the North Wind whereby men may go down, but the portals"
7067,BOOK XIII.,"toward the South pertain rather to the gods, whereby men may not enter:"
7068,BOOK XIII.,it is the way of the immortals.
7069,BOOK XIII.,
7070,BOOK XIII.,"Thither they, as having knowledge of that place, let drive their ship;"
7071,BOOK XIII.,"and now the vessel in full course ran ashore, half her keel’s length"
7072,BOOK XIII.,high; so well was she sped by the hands of the oarsmen. Then they
7073,BOOK XIII.,"alighted from the benched ship upon the land, and first they lifted"
7074,BOOK XIII.,"Odysseus from out the hollow ship, all as he was in the sheet of linen"
7075,BOOK XIII.,"and the bright rug, and laid him yet heavy with slumber on the sand."
7076,BOOK XIII.,And they took forth the goods which the lordly Phaeacians had given him
7077,BOOK XIII.,on his homeward way by grace of the great-hearted Athene. These they
7078,BOOK XIII.,"set in a heap by the trunk of the olive tree, a little aside from the"
7079,BOOK XIII.,"road, lest some wayfaring man, before Odysseus awakened, should come"
7080,BOOK XIII.,and spoil them. Then themselves departed homeward again. But the shaker
7081,BOOK XIII.,"of the earth forgat not the threats, wherewith at the first he had"
7082,BOOK XIII.,"threatened god like Odysseus, and he inquired into the counsel of Zeus,"
7083,BOOK XIII.,saying:
7084,BOOK XIII.,
7085,BOOK XIII.,"“Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among the"
7086,BOOK XIII.,"deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard, even Phaeacians,"
7087,BOOK XIII.,"who moreover are of mine own lineage. Lo, now I said that after much"
7088,BOOK XIII.,"affliction Odysseus should come home, for I had no mind to rob him"
7089,BOOK XIII.,"utterly of his return, when once thou hadst promised it and given"
7090,BOOK XIII.,"assent; but behold, in his sleep they have borne him in a swift ship"
7091,BOOK XIII.,"over the sea, and set him down in Ithaca, and given him gifts out of"
7092,BOOK XIII.,"measure, bronze and gold in plenty and woven raiment, much store, such"
7093,BOOK XIII.,"as never would Odysseus have won for himself out of Troy; yea, though"
7094,BOOK XIII.,he had returned unhurt with the share of the spoil that fell to him.”
7095,BOOK XIII.,
7096,BOOK XIII.,"And Zeus, the cloud gatherer, answered him saying: “Lo, now, shaker of"
7097,BOOK XIII.,"the earth, of widest power, what a word hast thou spoken! The gods"
7098,BOOK XIII.,nowise dishonour thee; hard would it be to assail with dishonour our
7099,BOOK XIII.,"eldest and our best. But if any man, giving place to his own hardihood"
7100,BOOK XIII.,"and strength, holds thee not in worship, thou hast always thy revenge"
7101,BOOK XIII.,"for the same, even in the time to come. Do thou as thou wilt, and as"
7102,BOOK XIII.,seems thee good.”
7103,BOOK XIII.,
7104,BOOK XIII.,"Then Poseidon, shaker of the earth, answered him: “Straightway would I"
7105,BOOK XIII.,"do even as thou sayest, O god of the dark clouds; but thy wrath I"
7106,BOOK XIII.,"always hold in awe and avoid. Howbeit, now I fain would smite a fair"
7107,BOOK XIII.,"ship of the Phaeacians, as she comes home from a convoy on the misty"
7108,BOOK XIII.,"deep, that thereby they may learn to hold their hands, and cease from"
7109,BOOK XIII.,giving escort to men; and I would overshadow their city with a great
7110,BOOK XIII.,mountain.”
7111,BOOK XIII.,
7112,BOOK XIII.,"And Zeus the gatherer of the clouds, answered him, saying: “Friend,"
7113,BOOK XIII.,learn now what seems best in my sight. At an hour when the folk are all
7114,BOOK XIII.,"looking forth from the city at the ship upon her way, smite her into a"
7115,BOOK XIII.,"stone hard by the land; a stone in the likeness of a swift ship, that"
7116,BOOK XIII.,"all mankind may marvel, and do thou overshadow their city with a great"
7117,BOOK XIII.,mountain.”
7118,BOOK XIII.,
7119,BOOK XIII.,"Now when Poseidon, shaker of the earth, heard this saying, he went on"
7120,BOOK XIII.,"his way to Scheria, where the Phaeacians dwell. There he abode awhile;"
7121,BOOK XIII.,"and lo, she drew near, the seafaring ship, lightly sped upon her way."
7122,BOOK XIII.,"Then nigh her came the shaker of the earth, and he smote her into a"
7123,BOOK XIII.,"stone, and rooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand; and"
7124,BOOK XIII.,he departed thence again.
7125,BOOK XIII.,
7126,BOOK XIII.,"Then one to the other they spake winged words, the Phaeacians of the"
7127,BOOK XIII.,"long oars, mariners renowned. And thus would they speak, looking each"
7128,BOOK XIII.,man to his neighbour:
7129,BOOK XIII.,
7130,BOOK XIII.,“Ah me! who is this that fettered our swift ship on the deep as she
7131,BOOK XIII.,drave homewards? Even now she stood full in sight.”
7132,BOOK XIII.,
7133,BOOK XIII.,Even so they would speak; but they knew not how these things were
7134,BOOK XIII.,ordained. And Alcinous made harangue and spake among them:
7135,BOOK XIII.,
7136,BOOK XIII.,"“Lo now, in very truth the ancient oracles of my father have come home"
7137,BOOK XIII.,"to me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was jealous of us, for that we"
7138,BOOK XIII.,give safe escort to all men. He said that the day would come when the
7139,BOOK XIII.,"god would smite a fair ship of the Phaeacians, as she came home from a"
7140,BOOK XIII.,"convoy on the misty deep, and overshadow our city with a great"
7141,BOOK XIII.,"mountain. Thus that ancient one would speak; and lo, all these things"
7142,BOOK XIII.,"now have an end. But come, let us all give ear and do according to my"
7143,BOOK XIII.,"word. Cease ye from the convoy of mortals, whensoever any shall come"
7144,BOOK XIII.,"unto our town, and let us sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if"
7145,BOOK XIII.,"perchance he may take pity, neither overshadow our city with a great"
7146,BOOK XIII.,mountain.”
7147,BOOK XIII.,
7148,BOOK XIII.,"So spake he, and they were dismayed and got ready the bulls. Thus were"
7149,BOOK XIII.,"they praying to the lord Poseidon, the princes and counsellors of the"
7150,BOOK XIII.,"land of the Phaeacians, as they stood about the altar."
7151,BOOK XIII.,
7152,BOOK XIII.,Even then the goodly Odysseus awoke where he slept on his native land;
7153,BOOK XIII.,"nor knew he the same again, having now been long afar, for around him"
7154,BOOK XIII.,"the goddess had shed a mist, even Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, to"
7155,BOOK XIII.,"the end that she might make him undiscovered for that he was, and might"
7156,BOOK XIII.,"expound to him all things, that so his wife should not know him neither"
7157,BOOK XIII.,"his townsmen and kinsfolk, ere the wooers had paid for all their"
7158,BOOK XIII.,transgressions. Wherefore each thing showed strange to the lord of the
7159,BOOK XIII.,"land, the long paths and the sheltering havens and the steep rocks and"
7160,BOOK XIII.,"the trees in their bloom. So he started up, and stood and looked upon"
7161,BOOK XIII.,"his native land, and then he made moan withal, and smote on both his"
7162,BOOK XIII.,"thighs with the down-stroke of his hands, and making lament, he spake,"
7163,BOOK XIII.,saying:
7164,BOOK XIII.,
7165,BOOK XIII.,"“Oh, woe is me, unto what mortals’ land am I now come? Say, are they"
7166,BOOK XIII.,"froward, and wild, and unjust, or hospitable and of a god-fearing mind?"
7167,BOOK XIII.,"Whither do I bear all this treasure? Yea, where am I wandering myself?"
7168,BOOK XIII.,"Oh that the treasure had remained with the Phaeacians where it was, so"
7169,BOOK XIII.,"had I come to some other of the mighty princes, who would have"
7170,BOOK XIII.,entreated me kindly and sent me on my way. But now I know not where to
7171,BOOK XIII.,"bestow these things, nor yet will I leave them here behind, lest haply"
7172,BOOK XIII.,"other men make spoil of them. Ah then, they are not wholly wise or"
7173,BOOK XIII.,"just, the princes and counsellors of the Phaeacians, who carried me to"
7174,BOOK XIII.,"a strange land. Verily they promised to bring me to clear-seen Ithaca,"
7175,BOOK XIII.,"but they performed it not. May Zeus requite them, the god of"
7176,BOOK XIII.,"suppliants, seeing that he watches over all men and punishes the"
7177,BOOK XIII.,"transgressor! But come, I will reckon up these goods and look to them,"
7178,BOOK XIII.,"lest the men be gone, and have taken aught away upon their hollow"
7179,BOOK XIII.,ship.”
7180,BOOK XIII.,
7181,BOOK XIII.,Therewith he set to number the fair tripods and the cauldrons and the
7182,BOOK XIII.,gold and the goodly woven raiment; and of all these he lacked not
7183,BOOK XIII.,"aught, but he bewailed him for his own country, as he walked downcast"
7184,BOOK XIII.,"by the shore of the sounding sea, and made sore lament. Then Athene"
7185,BOOK XIII.,"came nigh him in the guise of a young man, the herdsman of a flock, a"
7186,BOOK XIII.,"young man most delicate, such as are the sons of kings. And she had a"
7187,BOOK XIII.,"well-wrought mantle that fell in two folds about her shoulders, and"
7188,BOOK XIII.,"beneath her smooth feet she had sandals bound, and a javelin in her"
7189,BOOK XIII.,"hands. And Odysseus rejoiced as he saw her, and came over against her,"
7190,BOOK XIII.,and uttering his voice spake to her winged words:
7191,BOOK XIII.,
7192,BOOK XIII.,"“Friend, since thou art the first that I have chanced on in this land,"
7193,BOOK XIII.,"hail to thee, and with no ill-will mayest thou meet me! Nay, save this"
7194,BOOK XIII.,"my substance and save me too, for to thee as to a god I make prayer,"
7195,BOOK XIII.,"and to thy dear knees have I come. And herein tell me true, that I may"
7196,BOOK XIII.,"surely know. What land, what people is this? what men dwell therein?"
7197,BOOK XIII.,"Surely, methinks, it is some clear seen isle, or a shore of the rich"
7198,BOOK XIII.,mainland that lies and leans upon the deep.”
7199,BOOK XIII.,
7200,BOOK XIII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again: “Thou art"
7201,BOOK XIII.,"witless, stranger, or thou art come from afar, if indeed thou askest of"
7202,BOOK XIII.,"this land; nay, it is not so very nameless but that many men know it,"
7203,BOOK XIII.,"both all those who dwell toward the dawning and the sun, and they that"
7204,BOOK XIII.,abide over against the light toward the shadowy west. Verily it is
7205,BOOK XIII.,"rough and not fit for the driving of horses, yet is it not a very sorry"
7206,BOOK XIII.,"isle, though narrow withal. For herein is corn past telling, and herein"
7207,BOOK XIII.,"too wine is found, and the rain is on it evermore, and the fresh dew."
7208,BOOK XIII.,And it is good for feeding goats and feeding kine; all manner of wood
7209,BOOK XIII.,"is here, and watering-places unfailing are herein. Wherefore, stranger,"
7210,BOOK XIII.,"the name of Ithaca hath reached even unto Troy-land, which men say is"
7211,BOOK XIII.,far from this Achaean shore.”
7212,BOOK XIII.,
7213,BOOK XIII.,"So spake she, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad, and had joy"
7214,BOOK XIII.,"in his own country, according to the word of Pallas Athene, daughter of"
7215,BOOK XIII.,"Zeus, lord of the aegis. And he uttered his voice and spake unto her"
7216,BOOK XIII.,"winged words; yet he did not speak the truth, but took back the word"
7217,BOOK XIII.,"that was on his lips, for quick and crafty was his wit within his"
7218,BOOK XIII.,breast:
7219,BOOK XIII.,
7220,BOOK XIII.,"“Of Ithaca have I heard tell, even in broad Crete, far over the seas;"
7221,BOOK XIII.,and now have I come hither myself with these my goods. And I left as
7222,BOOK XIII.,"much again to my children, when I turned outlaw for the slaying of the"
7223,BOOK XIII.,"dear son of Idomeneus, Orsilochus, swift of foot, who in wide Crete was"
7224,BOOK XIII.,the swiftest of all men that live by bread. Now he would have despoiled
7225,BOOK XIII.,"me of all that booty of Troy, for the which I had endured pain of"
7226,BOOK XIII.,"heart, in passing through the wars of men, and the grievous waves of"
7227,BOOK XIII.,"the sea, for this cause that I would not do a favour to his father, and"
7228,BOOK XIII.,"make me his squire in the land of the Trojans, but commanded other"
7229,BOOK XIII.,fellowship of mine own. So I smote him with a bronze-shod spear as he
7230,BOOK XIII.,"came home from the field, lying in ambush for him by the wayside, with"
7231,BOOK XIII.,"one of my companions. And dark midnight held the heavens, and no man"
7232,BOOK XIII.,"marked us, but privily I took his life away. Now after I had slain him"
7233,BOOK XIII.,"with the sharp spear, straightway I went to a ship and besought the"
7234,BOOK XIII.,"lordly Phoenicians, and gave them spoil to their hearts’ desire. I"
7235,BOOK XIII.,"charged them to take me on board, and land me at Pylos or at goodly"
7236,BOOK XIII.,"Elis where the Epeans bear rule. Howbeit of a truth, the might of the"
7237,BOOK XIII.,"wind drave them out of their course, sore against their will, nor did"
7238,BOOK XIII.,"they wilfully play me false. Thence we were driven wandering, and came"
7239,BOOK XIII.,"hither by night. And with much ado we rowed onward into harbour, nor"
7240,BOOK XIII.,"took we any thought of supper, though we stood sore in need thereof,"
7241,BOOK XIII.,but even as we were we stept ashore and all lay down. Then over me
7242,BOOK XIII.,"there came sweet slumber in my weariness, but they took forth my goods"
7243,BOOK XIII.,"from the hollow ship, and set them by me where I myself lay upon the"
7244,BOOK XIII.,"sands. Then they went on board, and departed for the fair-lying land of"
7245,BOOK XIII.,Sidon; while as for me I was left stricken at heart.”
7246,BOOK XIII.,
7247,BOOK XIII.,"So spake he and the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, smiled, and caressed him"
7248,BOOK XIII.,"with her hand; and straightway she changed to the semblance of a woman,"
7249,BOOK XIII.,"fair and tall, and skilled in splendid handiwork. And uttering her"
7250,BOOK XIII.,voice she spake unto him winged words:
7251,BOOK XIII.,
7252,BOOK XIII.,"“Crafty must he be, and knavish, who would outdo thee in all manner of"
7253,BOOK XIII.,"guile, even if it were a god encountered thee. Hardy man, subtle of"
7254,BOOK XIII.,"wit, of guile insatiate, so thou wast not even in thine own country to"
7255,BOOK XIII.,"cease from thy sleights and knavish words, which thou lovest from the"
7256,BOOK XIII.,"bottom of thine heart! But come, no more let us tell of these things,"
7257,BOOK XIII.,"being both of us practised in deceits, for that thou art of all men far"
7258,BOOK XIII.,"the first in counsel and in discourse, and I in the company of all the"
7259,BOOK XIII.,"gods win renown for my wit and wile. Yet thou knewest not me, Pallas"
7260,BOOK XIII.,"Athene, daughter of Zeus, who am always by thee and guard thee in all"
7261,BOOK XIII.,"adventures. Yea, and I made thee to be beloved of all the Phaeacians."
7262,BOOK XIII.,And now am I come hither to contrive a plot with thee and to hide away
7263,BOOK XIII.,"the goods, that by my counsel and design the noble Phaeacians gave thee"
7264,BOOK XIII.,on thy homeward way. And I would tell thee how great a measure of
7265,BOOK XIII.,trouble thou art ordained to fulfil within thy well-builded house. But
7266,BOOK XIII.,"do thou harden thy heart, for so it must be, and tell none neither man"
7267,BOOK XIII.,"nor woman of all the folk, that thou hast indeed returned from"
7268,BOOK XIII.,"wandering, but in silence endure much sorrow, submitting thee to the"
7269,BOOK XIII.,despite of men.”
7270,BOOK XIII.,
7271,BOOK XIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Hard is it,"
7272,BOOK XIII.,"goddess, for a mortal man that meets thee to discern thee, howsoever"
7273,BOOK XIII.,wise he be; for thou takest upon thee every shape. But this I know
7274,BOOK XIII.,"well, that of old thou wast kindly to me, so long as we sons of the"
7275,BOOK XIII.,Achaeans made war in Troy. But so soon as we had sacked the steep city
7276,BOOK XIII.,"of Priam and had gone on board our ships, and the god had scattered the"
7277,BOOK XIII.,"Achaeans, thereafter I have never beheld thee, daughter of Zeus, nor"
7278,BOOK XIII.,"seen thee coming on board my ship, to ward off sorrow from me—but I"
7279,BOOK XIII.,"wandered evermore with a stricken heart, till the gods delivered me"
7280,BOOK XIII.,"from my evil case—even till the day when, within the fat land of the"
7281,BOOK XIII.,"men of Phaeacia, thou didst comfort me with thy words, and thyself"
7282,BOOK XIII.,didst lead me to their city. And now I beseech thee in thy father’s
7283,BOOK XIII.,"name to tell me: for I deem not that I am come to clear-seen Ithaca,"
7284,BOOK XIII.,"but I roam over some other land, and methinks that thou speakest thus"
7285,BOOK XIII.,to mock me and beguile my mind. Tell me whether in very deed I am come
7286,BOOK XIII.,to mine own dear country.”
7287,BOOK XIII.,
7288,BOOK XIII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Yea, such a thought"
7289,BOOK XIII.,as this is ever in thy breast. Wherefore I may in no wise leave thee in
7290,BOOK XIII.,"thy grief, so courteous art thou, so ready of wit and so prudent. Right"
7291,BOOK XIII.,gladly would any other man on his return from wandering have hasted to
7292,BOOK XIII.,behold his children and his wife in his halls; but thou hast no will to
7293,BOOK XIII.,"learn or to hear aught, till thou hast furthermore made trial of thy"
7294,BOOK XIII.,"wife, who sits as ever in her halls, and wearily for her the nights"
7295,BOOK XIII.,"wane always and the days, in shedding of tears. But of this I never"
7296,BOOK XIII.,"doubted, but ever knew it in my heart that thou wouldest come home with"
7297,BOOK XIII.,"the loss of all thy company. Yet, I tell thee, I had no mind to be at"
7298,BOOK XIII.,"strife with Poseidon, my own father’s brother, who laid up wrath in his"
7299,BOOK XIII.,"heart against thee, being angered at the blinding of his dear son. But"
7300,BOOK XIII.,"come, and I will show thee the place of the dwelling of Ithaca, that"
7301,BOOK XIII.,"thou mayst be assured. Lo, here is the haven of Phorcys, the ancient"
7302,BOOK XIII.,"one of the sea, and here at the haven’s head is the olive tree with"
7303,BOOK XIII.,"spreading leaves, and hard by it is the pleasant cave and shadowy,"
7304,BOOK XIII.,"sacred to the nymphs that are called the Naiads. Yonder, behold, is the"
7305,BOOK XIII.,"roofed cavern, where thou offeredst many an acceptable sacrifice of"
7306,BOOK XIII.,"hecatombs to the nymphs; and lo, this hill is Neriton, all clothed in"
7307,BOOK XIII.,forest.”
7308,BOOK XIII.,
7309,BOOK XIII.,"Therewith the goddess scattered the mist, and the land appeared. Then"
7310,BOOK XIII.,"the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad rejoicing in his own land, and"
7311,BOOK XIII.,"he kissed the earth, the grain-giver. And anon he prayed to the nymphs,"
7312,BOOK XIII.,"and lifted up his hands, saying:"
7313,BOOK XIII.,
7314,BOOK XIII.,"“Ye Naiad nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to look on you"
7315,BOOK XIII.,"again, but now be ye greeted in my loving prayers: yea, and gifts as"
7316,BOOK XIII.,"aforetime I will give, if the daughter of Zeus, driver of the spoil,"
7317,BOOK XIII.,"suffer me of her grace myself to live, and bring my dear son to"
7318,BOOK XIII.,manhood.”
7319,BOOK XIII.,
7320,BOOK XIII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again: “Be of good"
7321,BOOK XIII.,"courage, and let not thy heart be careful about these things. But come,"
7322,BOOK XIII.,let us straightway set thy goods in the secret place of the wondrous
7323,BOOK XIII.,"cave, that there they may abide for thee safe. And let us for ourselves"
7324,BOOK XIII.,advise us how all may be for the very best.”
7325,BOOK XIII.,
7326,BOOK XIII.,"Therewith the goddess plunged into the shadowy cave, searching out the"
7327,BOOK XIII.,"chambers of the cavern. Meanwhile Odysseus brought up his treasure, the"
7328,BOOK XIII.,"gold and the unyielding bronze and fair woven raiment, which the"
7329,BOOK XIII.,"Phaeacians gave him. And these things he laid by with care, and Pallas"
7330,BOOK XIII.,"Athene, daughter of Zeus, lord of the aegis, set a stone against the"
7331,BOOK XIII.,door of the cave. Then they twain sat down by the trunk of the sacred
7332,BOOK XIII.,"olive tree, and devised death for the froward wooers. And the goddess,"
7333,BOOK XIII.,"grey-eyed Athene, spake first, saying:"
7334,BOOK XIII.,
7335,BOOK XIII.,"“Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, advise"
7336,BOOK XIII.,thee how thou mayest stretch forth thine hands upon the shameless
7337,BOOK XIII.,"wooers, who now these three years lord it through thy halls, as they"
7338,BOOK XIII.,"woo thy godlike wife and proffer the gifts of wooing. And she, that is"
7339,BOOK XIII.,"ever bewailing her for thy return, gives hope to all and makes promises"
7340,BOOK XIII.,"to every man and sends them messages, but her mind is set on other"
7341,BOOK XIII.,things.”
7342,BOOK XIII.,
7343,BOOK XIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her, saying:"
7344,BOOK XIII.,
7345,BOOK XIII.,"“Lo now, in very truth I was like to have perished in my halls by the"
7346,BOOK XIII.,"evil doom of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, hadst not thou, goddess,"
7347,BOOK XIII.,"declared me each thing aright. Come then, weave some counsel whereby I"
7348,BOOK XIII.,"may requite them; and thyself stand by me, and put great boldness of"
7349,BOOK XIII.,"spirit within me, even as in the day when we loosed the shining coronal"
7350,BOOK XIII.,"of Troy. If but thou wouldest stand by me with such eagerness, thou"
7351,BOOK XIII.,"grey-eyed goddess, I would war even with three hundred men, with thee"
7352,BOOK XIII.,"my lady and goddess, if thou of thy grace didst succour me the while.”"
7353,BOOK XIII.,
7354,BOOK XIII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Yea, verily I will"
7355,BOOK XIII.,"be near thee nor will I forget thee, whensoever we come to this toil:"
7356,BOOK XIII.,and methinks that certain of the wooers that devour thy livelihood
7357,BOOK XIII.,"shall bespatter the boundless earth with blood and brains. But come, I"
7358,BOOK XIII.,will make thee such-like that no man shall know thee. Thy fair skin I
7359,BOOK XIII.,"will wither on thy supple limbs, and make waste thy yellow hair from"
7360,BOOK XIII.,"off thy head, and wrap thee in a foul garment, such that one would"
7361,BOOK XIII.,"shudder to see a man therein.[24] And I will dim thy two eyes, erewhile"
7362,BOOK XIII.,"so fair, in such wise that thou mayest be unseemly in the sight of all"
7363,BOOK XIII.,"the wooers and of thy wife and son, whom thou didst leave in thy halls."
7364,BOOK XIII.,"And do thou thyself first of all go unto the swineherd, who tends thy"
7365,BOOK XIII.,"swine, loyal and at one with thee, and loves thy son and constant"
7366,BOOK XIII.,"Penelope. Him shalt thou find sitting by the swine, as they are feeding"
7367,BOOK XIII.,"near the rock of Corax and the spring Arethusa, and there they eat"
7368,BOOK XIII.,"abundance of acorns and drink the black water, things whereby swine"
7369,BOOK XIII.,"grow fat and well-liking. There do thou abide and sit by the swine, and"
7370,BOOK XIII.,"find out all, till I have gone to Sparta, the land of fair women, to"
7371,BOOK XIII.,"call Telemachus thy dear son, Odysseus, who hath betaken himself to"
7372,BOOK XIII.,"spacious Lacedaemon, to the house of Menelaus to seek tidings of thee,"
7373,BOOK XIII.,whether haply thou are yet alive.”

7375,BOOK XIII.,"[24] Reading ἄνθρωπον, not ἄνθρωπος."
7376,BOOK XIII.,
7377,BOOK XIII.,
7378,BOOK XIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Nay, wherefore then"
7379,BOOK XIII.,"didst thou not tell him, seeing thou hast knowledge of all? Was it,"
7380,BOOK XIII.,"perchance, that he too may wander in sorrow over the unharvested seas,"
7381,BOOK XIII.,and that others may consume his livelihood?”
7382,BOOK XIII.,
7383,BOOK XIII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Nay, let him not be"
7384,BOOK XIII.,"heavy on thy heart. I myself was his guide, that by going thither he"
7385,BOOK XIII.,"might win a good report. Lo, he knows no toil, but he sits in peace in"
7386,BOOK XIII.,"the palace of the son of Atreus, and has boundless store about him."
7387,BOOK XIII.,"Truly the young men with their black ship they lie in wait, and are"
7388,BOOK XIII.,"eager to slay him ere he come to his own country. But this, methinks,"
7389,BOOK XIII.,"shall never be. Yea, sooner shall the earth close over certain of the"
7390,BOOK XIII.,wooers that devour thy livelihood.”
7391,BOOK XIII.,
7392,BOOK XIII.,Therewith Athene touched him with her wand. His fair flesh she withered
7393,BOOK XIII.,"on his supple limbs, and made waste his yellow hair from off his head,"
7394,BOOK XIII.,"and over all his limbs she cast the skin of an old man, and dimmed his"
7395,BOOK XIII.,"two eyes, erewhile so fair. And she changed his raiment to a vile wrap"
7396,BOOK XIII.,"and a doublet, torn garments and filthy, stained with foul smoke. And"
7397,BOOK XIII.,"over all she clad him with the great bald hide of a swift stag, and she"
7398,BOOK XIII.,"gave him a staff and a mean tattered scrip, and a cord therewith to"
7399,BOOK XIII.,hang it.
7400,BOOK XIII.,
7401,BOOK XIII.,"And after they twain had taken this counsel together, they parted; and"
7402,BOOK XIII.,she now went to goodly Lacedaemon to fetch the son of Odysseus.

7409,BOOK XIV.,"Odysseus, in the form of a beggar, goes to Eumaeus, the master of his"
7410,BOOK XIV.,"swine, where he is well used and tells a feigned story, and informs"
7411,BOOK XIV.,himself of the behaviour of the wooers.
7412,BOOK XIV.,
7413,BOOK XIV.,
7414,BOOK XIV.,"But Odysseus fared forth from the haven by the rough track, up the"
7415,BOOK XIV.,"wooded country and through the heights, where Athene had showed him"
7416,BOOK XIV.,"that he should find the goodly swineherd, who cared most for his"
7417,BOOK XIV.,substance of all the thralls that goodly Odysseus had gotten.
7418,BOOK XIV.,
7419,BOOK XIV.,"Now he found him sitting at the vestibule of the house, where his"
7420,BOOK XIV.,"courtyard was builded high, in a place with wide prospect; a great"
7421,BOOK XIV.,"court it was and a fair, with free range round it. This the swineherd"
7422,BOOK XIV.,"had builded by himself for the swine of his lord who was afar, and his"
7423,BOOK XIV.,mistress and the old man Laertes knew not of it. With stones from the
7424,BOOK XIV.,"quarry had he builded it, and coped it with a fence of white thorn, and"
7425,BOOK XIV.,"he had split an oak to the dark core, and without he had driven stakes"
7426,BOOK XIV.,"the whole length thereof on either side, set thick and close; and"
7427,BOOK XIV.,within the courtyard he made twelve styes hard by one another to be
7428,BOOK XIV.,"beds for the swine, and in each stye fifty grovelling swine were"
7429,BOOK XIV.,"penned, brood swine; but the boars slept without. Now these were far"
7430,BOOK XIV.,"fewer in number, the godlike wooers minishing them at their feasts, for"
7431,BOOK XIV.,the swineherd ever sent in the best of all the fatted hogs. And their
7432,BOOK XIV.,tale was three hundred and three-score. And by them always slept four
7433,BOOK XIV.,"dogs, as fierce as wild beasts, which the swineherd had bred, a master"
7434,BOOK XIV.,"of men. Now he was fitting sandals to his feet, cutting a good brown"
7435,BOOK XIV.,"oxhide, while the rest of his fellows, three in all, were abroad this"
7436,BOOK XIV.,"way and that, with the droves of swine; while the fourth he had sent to"
7437,BOOK XIV.,"the city to take a boar to the proud wooers, as needs he must, that"
7438,BOOK XIV.,they might sacrifice it and satisfy their soul with flesh.
7439,BOOK XIV.,
7440,BOOK XIV.,"And of a sudden the baying dogs saw Odysseus, and they ran at him"
7441,BOOK XIV.,"yelping, but Odysseus in his wariness sat him down, and let the staff"
7442,BOOK XIV.,fall from his hand. There by his own homestead would he have suffered
7443,BOOK XIV.,"foul hurt, but the swineherd with quick feet hasted after them, and"
7444,BOOK XIV.,"sped through the outer door, and let the skin fall from his hand. And"
7445,BOOK XIV.,"the hounds he chid and drave them this way and that, with a shower of"
7446,BOOK XIV.,"stones, and he spake unto his lord, saying:"
7447,BOOK XIV.,
7448,BOOK XIV.,"“Old man, truly the dogs went nigh to be the death of thee all of a"
7449,BOOK XIV.,"sudden, so shouldest thou have brought shame on me. Yea, and the gods"
7450,BOOK XIV.,"have given me other pains and griefs enough. Here I sit, mourning and"
7451,BOOK XIV.,"sorrowing for my godlike lord, and foster the fat swine for others to"
7452,BOOK XIV.,"eat, while he craving, perchance, for food, wanders over some land and"
7453,BOOK XIV.,"city of men of a strange speech, if haply he yet lives and beholds the"
7454,BOOK XIV.,"sunlight. But come with me, let us to the inner steading, old man, that"
7455,BOOK XIV.,"when thy heart is satisfied with bread and wine, thou too mayest tell"
7456,BOOK XIV.,"thy tale and declare whence thou art, and how many woes thou hast"
7457,BOOK XIV.,endured.”
7458,BOOK XIV.,
7459,BOOK XIV.,"Therewith the goodly swineherd led him to the steading, and took him in"
7460,BOOK XIV.,"and set him down, and strewed beneath him thick brushwood, and spread"
7461,BOOK XIV.,"thereon the hide of a shaggy wild goat, wide and soft, which served"
7462,BOOK XIV.,himself for a mattress. And Odysseus rejoiced that he had given him
7463,BOOK XIV.,"such welcome, and spake and hailed him:"
7464,BOOK XIV.,
7465,BOOK XIV.,"“May Zeus, O stranger, and all the other deathless gods grant thee thy"
7466,BOOK XIV.,"dearest wish, since thou hast received me heartily!”"
7467,BOOK XIV.,
7468,BOOK XIV.,"Then, O swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou answer him, saying: “Guest of"
7469,BOOK XIV.,"mine, it were an impious thing for me to slight a stranger, even if"
7470,BOOK XIV.,there came a meaner man than thou; for from Zeus are all strangers and
7471,BOOK XIV.,"beggars; and a little gift from such as we, is dear; for this is the"
7472,BOOK XIV.,"way with thralls, who are ever in fear when young lords like ours bear"
7473,BOOK XIV.,rule over them. For surely the gods have stayed the returning of my
7474,BOOK XIV.,"master, who would have loved me diligently, and given me somewhat of my"
7475,BOOK XIV.,"own, a house and a parcel of ground, and a comely[25] wife, such as a"
7476,BOOK XIV.,"kind lord gives to his man, who hath laboured much for him and the work"
7477,BOOK XIV.,"of whose hands God hath likewise increased, even as he increaseth this"
7478,BOOK XIV.,work of mine whereat I abide. Therefore would my lord have rewarded me
7479,BOOK XIV.,"greatly, had he grown old at home. But he hath perished, as I would"
7480,BOOK XIV.,"that all the stock of Helen had perished utterly, forasmuch as she hath"
7481,BOOK XIV.,caused the loosening of many a man’s knees. For he too departed to
7482,BOOK XIV.,"Ilios of the goodly steeds, to get atonement for Agamemnon, that so he"
7483,BOOK XIV.,might war with the Trojans.”
7484,BOOK XIV.,
7485,BOOK XIV.,[25] Reading ἐύμορφόν.
7486,BOOK XIV.,
7487,BOOK XIV.,
7488,BOOK XIV.,"Therewith he quickly bound up his doublet with his girdle, and went his"
7489,BOOK XIV.,"way to the styes, where the tribes of the swine were penned. Thence he"
7490,BOOK XIV.,"took and brought forth two, and sacrificed them both, and singed them"
7491,BOOK XIV.,"and cut them small, and spitted them. And when he had roasted all, he"
7492,BOOK XIV.,"bare and set it by Odysseus, all hot as it was upon the spits, and he"
7493,BOOK XIV.,sprinkled thereupon white barley-meal. Then in a bowl of ivywood he
7494,BOOK XIV.,"mixed the honey-sweet wine, and himself sat over against him and bade"
7495,BOOK XIV.,him fall to:
7496,BOOK XIV.,
7497,BOOK XIV.,"“Eat now, stranger, such fare as thralls have to hand, even flesh of"
7498,BOOK XIV.,"sucking pigs; but the fatted hogs the wooers devour, for they know not"
7499,BOOK XIV.,the wrath of the gods nor any pity. Verily the blessed gods love not
7500,BOOK XIV.,"froward deeds, but they reverence justice and the righteous acts of"
7501,BOOK XIV.,"men. Yet even foes and men unfriendly, that land on a strange coast,"
7502,BOOK XIV.,"and Zeus grants them a prey, and they have laden their ships and depart"
7503,BOOK XIV.,"for home; yea, even on their hearts falls strong fear of the wrath of"
7504,BOOK XIV.,"the gods. But lo you, these men know somewhat,—for they have heard an"
7505,BOOK XIV.,"utterance of a god—, even the tidings of our lord’s evil end, seeing"
7506,BOOK XIV.,"that they are not minded justly to woo, nor to go back to their own,"
7507,BOOK XIV.,"but at ease they devour our wealth with insolence, and now there is no"
7508,BOOK XIV.,"sparing. For every day and every night that comes from Zeus, they make"
7509,BOOK XIV.,"sacrifice not of one victim only, nor of two, and wine they draw and"
7510,BOOK XIV.,"waste it riotously. For surely his livelihood was great past telling,"
7511,BOOK XIV.,"no lord in the dark mainland had so much, nor any in Ithaca itself;"
7512,BOOK XIV.,"nay, not twenty men together have wealth so great, and I will tell thee"
7513,BOOK XIV.,"the sum thereof. Twelve herds of kine upon the mainland, as many flocks"
7514,BOOK XIV.,"of sheep, as many droves of swine, as many ranging herds of goats, that"
7515,BOOK XIV.,"his own shepherds and strangers pasture. And ranging herds of goats,"
7516,BOOK XIV.,"eleven in all, graze here by the extremity of the island with trusty"
7517,BOOK XIV.,men to watch them. And day by day each man of these ever drives one of
7518,BOOK XIV.,"the flock to the wooers, whichsoever seems the best of the fatted"
7519,BOOK XIV.,goats. But as for me I guard and keep these swine and I choose out for
7520,BOOK XIV.,"them, as well as I may, the best of the swine and send it hence.”"
7521,BOOK XIV.,
7522,BOOK XIV.,"So spake he, but Odysseus ceased not to eat flesh and drink wine right"
7523,BOOK XIV.,"eagerly and in silence, and the while was sowing the seeds of evil for"
7524,BOOK XIV.,the wooers. Now when he had well eaten and comforted his heart with
7525,BOOK XIV.,"food, then the herdsman filled him the bowl out of which he was wont"
7526,BOOK XIV.,"himself to drink, and he gave it him brimming with wine, and he took it"
7527,BOOK XIV.,"and was glad at heart, and uttering his voice spake to him winged"
7528,BOOK XIV.,words:
7529,BOOK XIV.,
7530,BOOK XIV.,"“My friend, who was it then that bought thee with his wealth, a man so"
7531,BOOK XIV.,exceedingly rich and mighty as thou declarest? Thou saidest that he
7532,BOOK XIV.,"perished to get atonement for Agamemnon; tell me, if perchance I may"
7533,BOOK XIV.,"know him, being such an one as thou sayest. For Zeus, methinks, and the"
7534,BOOK XIV.,other deathless gods know whether I may bring tidings of having seen
7535,BOOK XIV.,him; for I have wandered far.”
7536,BOOK XIV.,
7537,BOOK XIV.,"Then the swineherd, a master of men, answered him: “Old man, no"
7538,BOOK XIV.,wanderer who may come hither and bring tidings of him can win the ear
7539,BOOK XIV.,of his wife and his dear son; but lightly do vagrants lie when they
7540,BOOK XIV.,"need entertainment, and care not to tell truth. Whosoever comes"
7541,BOOK XIV.,"straying to the land of Ithaca, goes to my mistress and speaks words of"
7542,BOOK XIV.,guile. And she receives him kindly and lovingly and inquires of all
7543,BOOK XIV.,"things, and the tears fall from her eyelids for weeping, as is meet for"
7544,BOOK XIV.,a woman when her lord hath died afar. And quickly enough wouldst thou
7545,BOOK XIV.,"too, old man, forge a tale, if any would but give thee a mantle and a"
7546,BOOK XIV.,"doublet for raiment. But as for him, dogs and swift fowls are like"
7547,BOOK XIV.,"already to have torn his skin from the bones, and his spirit hath left"
7548,BOOK XIV.,"him. Or the fishes have eaten him in the deep, and there lie his bones"
7549,BOOK XIV.,"swathed in sand-drift on the shore. Yonder then hath he perished, but"
7550,BOOK XIV.,"for his friends nought is ordained but care, for all, but for me in"
7551,BOOK XIV.,"chief. For never again shall I find a lord so gentle, how far soever I"
7552,BOOK XIV.,"may go, not though again I attain unto the house of my father and my"
7553,BOOK XIV.,"mother, where at first I was born, and they nourished me themselves and"
7554,BOOK XIV.,with their own hands they reared me. Nor henceforth it is not for these
7555,BOOK XIV.,"that I sorrow so much, though I long to behold them with mine eyes in"
7556,BOOK XIV.,"mine own country, but desire comes over me for Odysseus who is afar."
7557,BOOK XIV.,"His name, stranger, even though he is not here, it shameth me to speak,"
7558,BOOK XIV.,"for he loved me exceedingly, and cared for me at heart; nay, I call him"
7559,BOOK XIV.,"‘worshipful,’ albeit he is far hence.”"
7560,BOOK XIV.,
7561,BOOK XIV.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus spake to him again: “My friend,"
7562,BOOK XIV.,"forasmuch as thou gainsayest utterly, and sayest that henceforth he"
7563,BOOK XIV.,"will not come again, and thine heart is ever slow to believe, therefore"
7564,BOOK XIV.,"will I tell thee not lightly but with an oath, that Odysseus shall"
7565,BOOK XIV.,return. And let me have the wages of good tidings as soon as ever he in
7566,BOOK XIV.,his journeying shall come hither to his home. Then clothe me in a
7567,BOOK XIV.,"mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment. But ere that, albeit I am sore in"
7568,BOOK XIV.,"need I will not take aught, for hateful to me even as the gates of"
7569,BOOK XIV.,"hell, is that man, who under stress of poverty speaks words of guile."
7570,BOOK XIV.,"Now be Zeus my witness before any god, and the hospitable board and the"
7571,BOOK XIV.,"hearth of noble Odysseus whereunto I am come, that all these things"
7572,BOOK XIV.,shall surely be accomplished even as I tell thee. In this same year
7573,BOOK XIV.,Odysseus shall come hither; as the old moon wanes and the new is born
7574,BOOK XIV.,"shall he return to his home, and shall take vengeance on all who here"
7575,BOOK XIV.,dishonour his wife and noble son.”
7576,BOOK XIV.,
7577,BOOK XIV.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “Old man, it is not I"
7578,BOOK XIV.,"then, that shall ever pay thee these wages of good tidings, nor"
7579,BOOK XIV.,"henceforth shall Odysseus ever come to his home. Nay drink in peace,"
7580,BOOK XIV.,"and let us turn our thoughts to other matters, and bring not these to"
7581,BOOK XIV.,"my remembrance, for surely my heart within me is sorrowful whenever any"
7582,BOOK XIV.,"man puts me in mind of my true lord. But as for thine oath, we will let"
7583,BOOK XIV.,"it go by; yet, oh that Odysseus may come according to my desire, and"
7584,BOOK XIV.,the desire of Penelope and of that old man Laertes and godlike
7585,BOOK XIV.,Telemachus! But now I make a comfortless lament for the boy begotten of
7586,BOOK XIV.,"Odysseus, even for Telemachus. When the gods had reared him like a"
7587,BOOK XIV.,"young sapling, and I thought that he would be no worse man among men"
7588,BOOK XIV.,"than his dear father, glorious in form and face, some god or some man"
7589,BOOK XIV.,"marred his good wits within him, and he went to fair Pylos after"
7590,BOOK XIV.,tidings of his sire. And now the lordly wooers lie in wait for him on
7591,BOOK XIV.,"his way home, that the race of godlike Arceisius may perish nameless"
7592,BOOK XIV.,"out of Ithaca. Howbeit, no more of him now, whether he shall be taken"
7593,BOOK XIV.,"or whether he shall escape, and Cronion stretch out his hand to shield"
7594,BOOK XIV.,"him. But come, old man, do thou tell me of thine own troubles. And"
7595,BOOK XIV.,"herein tell me true, that I may surely know. Who art thou of the sons"
7596,BOOK XIV.,"of men, and whence? Where is thy city, where are they that begat thee?"
7597,BOOK XIV.,"Say on what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors bring"
7598,BOOK XIV.,"thee to Ithaca, and who did they avow them to be? For in nowise do I"
7599,BOOK XIV.,deem that thou camest hither by land.”
7600,BOOK XIV.,
7601,BOOK XIV.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Yea now, I will"
7602,BOOK XIV.,tell thee all most plainly. Might we have food and sweet wine enough to
7603,BOOK XIV.,"last for long, while we abide within thy hut to feast thereon in quiet,"
7604,BOOK XIV.,and others betake them to their work; then could I easily speak for a
7605,BOOK XIV.,"whole year, nor yet make a full end of telling all the troubles of my"
7606,BOOK XIV.,"spirit, all the travail I have wrought by the will of the gods."
7607,BOOK XIV.,
7608,BOOK XIV.,"“I avow that I come by lineage from wide Crete, and am the son of a"
7609,BOOK XIV.,"wealthy man. And many other sons he had born and bred in the halls,"
7610,BOOK XIV.,lawful born of a wedded wife; but the mother that bare me was a
7611,BOOK XIV.,"concubine bought with a price. Yet Castor son of Hylax, of whose blood"
7612,BOOK XIV.,"I avow me to be, gave me no less honour than his lawful sons. Now he at"
7613,BOOK XIV.,"the time got worship even as a god from the Cretans in the land, for"
7614,BOOK XIV.,wealth and riches and sons renowned. Howbeit the fates of death bare
7615,BOOK XIV.,"him away to the house of Hades, and his gallant sons divided among them"
7616,BOOK XIV.,his living and cast lots for it. But to me they gave a very small gift
7617,BOOK XIV.,"and assigned me a dwelling, and I took unto me a wife, the daughter of"
7618,BOOK XIV.,"men that had wide lands, by reason of my valour, for that I was no"
7619,BOOK XIV.,"weakling nor a dastard; but now all my might has failed me, yet even so"
7620,BOOK XIV.,I deem that thou mightest guess from seeing the stubble what the grain
7621,BOOK XIV.,"has been, for of trouble I have plenty and to spare. But then verily"
7622,BOOK XIV.,did Ares and Athene give me boldness and courage to hurl through the
7623,BOOK XIV.,"press of men, whensoever I chose the best warriors for an ambush,"
7624,BOOK XIV.,sowing the seeds of evil for my foes; no boding of death was ever in my
7625,BOOK XIV.,"lordly heart, but I would leap out the foremost and slay with the spear"
7626,BOOK XIV.,whoso of my foes was less fleet of foot than I. Such an one was I in
7627,BOOK XIV.,"war, but the labour of the field I never loved, nor home-keeping"
7628,BOOK XIV.,"thrift, that breeds brave children, but galleys with their oars were"
7629,BOOK XIV.,"dear to me, and wars and polished shafts and darts—baneful things"
7630,BOOK XIV.,"whereat others use to shudder. But that, methinks, was dear to me which"
7631,BOOK XIV.,"the god put in my heart, for divers men take delight in divers deeds."
7632,BOOK XIV.,"For ere ever the sons of the Achaeans had set foot on the land of Troy,"
7633,BOOK XIV.,I had nine times been a leader of men and of swift-faring ships against
7634,BOOK XIV.,"a strange people, and wealth fell ever to my hands. Of the booty I"
7635,BOOK XIV.,"would choose out for me all that I craved, and much thereafter I won by"
7636,BOOK XIV.,"lot. So my house got increase speedily, and thus I waxed dread and"
7637,BOOK XIV.,"honourable among the Cretans. But when Zeus, of the far-borne voice,"
7638,BOOK XIV.,devised at the last that hateful path which loosened the knees of many
7639,BOOK XIV.,"a man in death, then the people called on me and on renowned Idomeneus"
7640,BOOK XIV.,"to lead the ships to Ilios, nor was there any way whereby to refuse,"
7641,BOOK XIV.,for the people’s voice bore hard upon us. There we sons of the Achaeans
7642,BOOK XIV.,"warred for nine whole years, and then in the tenth year we sacked the"
7643,BOOK XIV.,"city of Priam, and departed homeward with our ships, and a god"
7644,BOOK XIV.,"scattered the Achaeans. But Zeus, the counsellor, devised mischief"
7645,BOOK XIV.,"against me, wretched man that I was! For one month only I abode and had"
7646,BOOK XIV.,"joy in my children and my wedded wife, and all that I had; and"
7647,BOOK XIV.,thereafter my spirit bade me fit out ships in the best manner and sail
7648,BOOK XIV.,to Egypt with my godlike company. Nine ships I fitted out and the host
7649,BOOK XIV.,"was gathered quickly; and then for six days my dear company feasted,"
7650,BOOK XIV.,and I gave them many victims that they might sacrifice to the gods and
7651,BOOK XIV.,prepare a feast for themselves. But on the seventh day we set sail from
7652,BOOK XIV.,"wide Crete, with a North Wind fresh and fair, and lightly we ran as it"
7653,BOOK XIV.,"were down stream, yea and no harm came to any ship of mine, but we sat"
7654,BOOK XIV.,"safe and hale, while the wind and the pilots guided the barques. And on"
7655,BOOK XIV.,"the fifth day we came to the fair-flowing Aegyptus, and in the river"
7656,BOOK XIV.,Aegyptus I stayed my curved ships. Then verily I bade my dear
7657,BOOK XIV.,"companions to abide there by the ships and to guard them, and I sent"
7658,BOOK XIV.,forth scouts to range the points of outlook. But my men gave place to
7659,BOOK XIV.,"wantonness, being the fools of their own force, and soon they fell to"
7660,BOOK XIV.,"wasting the fields of the Egyptians, exceeding fair, and led away their"
7661,BOOK XIV.,wives and infant children and slew the men. And the cry came quickly to
7662,BOOK XIV.,"the city, and the people hearing the shout came forth at the breaking"
7663,BOOK XIV.,"of the day, and all the plain was filled with footmen and chariots and"
7664,BOOK XIV.,"with the glitter of bronze. And Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, sent"
7665,BOOK XIV.,"an evil panic upon my company, and none durst stand and face the foe,"
7666,BOOK XIV.,for danger encompassed us on every side. There they slew many of us
7667,BOOK XIV.,"with the edge of the sword, and others they led up with them alive to"
7668,BOOK XIV.,"work for them perforce. But as for me, Zeus himself put a thought into"
7669,BOOK XIV.,"my heart; would to God that I had rather died, and met my fate there in"
7670,BOOK XIV.,"Egypt, for sorrow was still mine host! Straightway I put off my"
7671,BOOK XIV.,"well-wrought helmet from my head, and the shield from off my shoulders,"
7672,BOOK XIV.,"and I cast away my spear from my hand, and I came over against the"
7673,BOOK XIV.,"chariots of the king, and clasped and kissed his knees, and he saved me"
7674,BOOK XIV.,"and delivered me, and setting me on his own chariot took me weeping to"
7675,BOOK XIV.,"his home. Truly many an one made at me with their ashen spears, eager"
7676,BOOK XIV.,"to slay me, for verily they were sore angered. But the king kept them"
7677,BOOK XIV.,"off and had respect unto the wrath of Zeus, the god of strangers, who"
7678,BOOK XIV.,chiefly hath displeasure at evil deeds. So for seven whole years I
7679,BOOK XIV.,"abode with their king, and gathered much substance among the Egyptians,"
7680,BOOK XIV.,for they all gave me gifts. But when the eighth year came in due
7681,BOOK XIV.,"season, there arrived a Phoenician practised in deceit, a greedy knave,"
7682,BOOK XIV.,who had already done much mischief among men. He wrought on me with his
7683,BOOK XIV.,"cunning, and took me with him until he came to Phoenicia, where was his"
7684,BOOK XIV.,house and where his treasures lay. There I abode with him for the space
7685,BOOK XIV.,"of a full year. But when now the months and days were fulfilled, as the"
7686,BOOK XIV.,"year came round and the seasons returned, he set me aboard a seafaring"
7687,BOOK XIV.,"ship for Libya, under colour as though I was to convey a cargo thither"
7688,BOOK XIV.,"with him, but his purpose was to sell me in Libya, and get a great"
7689,BOOK XIV.,"price. So I went with him on board, perforce, yet boding evil. And the"
7690,BOOK XIV.,"ship ran before a North Wind fresh and fair, through the mid sea over"
7691,BOOK XIV.,"above Crete, and Zeus contrived the destruction of the crew. But when"
7692,BOOK XIV.,"we left Crete, and no land showed in sight but sky and sea only, even"
7693,BOOK XIV.,"then the son of Cronos stayed a dark cloud over the hollow ship, and"
7694,BOOK XIV.,the deep grew dark beneath it. And in the same moment Zeus thundered
7695,BOOK XIV.,"and smote his bolt into the ship, and she reeled all over being"
7696,BOOK XIV.,"stricken by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled with fire and brimstone,"
7697,BOOK XIV.,and all the crew fell overboard. And like sea-gulls they were borne
7698,BOOK XIV.,"hither and thither on the waves about the black ship, and the god cut"
7699,BOOK XIV.,off their return. But in this hour of my affliction Zeus himself put
7700,BOOK XIV.,"into my hands the huge mast of the dark-prowed ship, that even yet I"
7701,BOOK XIV.,might escape from harm. So I clung round the mast and was borne by the
7702,BOOK XIV.,"ruinous winds. For nine days was I borne, and on the tenth black night"
7703,BOOK XIV.,the great rolling wave brought me nigh to the land of the Thesprotians.
7704,BOOK XIV.,"There the king of the Thesprotians, the lord Pheidon, took me in"
7705,BOOK XIV.,"freely, for his dear son lighted on me and raised me by the hand and"
7706,BOOK XIV.,"led me to his house, foredone with toil and the keen air, till he came"
7707,BOOK XIV.,to his father’s palace. And he clothed me in a mantle and a doublet for
7708,BOOK XIV.,raiment.
7709,BOOK XIV.,
7710,BOOK XIV.,"“There I heard tidings of Odysseus, for the king told me that he had"
7711,BOOK XIV.,"entertained him, and kindly entreated him on his way to his own"
7712,BOOK XIV.,"country; and he showed me all the wealth that Odysseus had gathered,"
7713,BOOK XIV.,bronze and gold and well-wrought iron; yea it would suffice for his
7714,BOOK XIV.,"children after him even to the tenth generation, so great were the"
7715,BOOK XIV.,"treasures he had stored in the chambers of the king. He had gone, he"
7716,BOOK XIV.,"said, to Dodona to hear the counsel of Zeus, from the high leafy oak"
7717,BOOK XIV.,"tree of the god, how he should return to the fat land of Ithaca after"
7718,BOOK XIV.,"long absence, whether openly or by stealth. Moreover, he sware, in mine"
7719,BOOK XIV.,"own presence, as he poured the drink offering in his house, that the"
7720,BOOK XIV.,"ship was drawn down to the sea and his company were ready, who were to"
7721,BOOK XIV.,"convey him to his own dear country. But ere that, he sent me off, for"
7722,BOOK XIV.,"it chanced that a ship of the Thesprotians was starting for Dulichium,"
7723,BOOK XIV.,a land rich in grain. Thither he bade them bring me with all diligence
7724,BOOK XIV.,to the king Acastus. But an evil counsel concerning me found favour in
7725,BOOK XIV.,"their sight, that even yet I might reach the extremity of sorrow. When"
7726,BOOK XIV.,"the seafaring ship had sailed a great way from the land, anon they"
7727,BOOK XIV.,sought how they might compass for me the day of slavery. They stript me
7728,BOOK XIV.,"of my garments, my mantle and a doublet, and changed my raiment to a"
7729,BOOK XIV.,"vile wrap and doublet, tattered garments, even those thou seest now"
7730,BOOK XIV.,before thee; and in the evening they reached the fields of clear-seen
7731,BOOK XIV.,Ithaca. There in the decked ship they bound me closely with a twisted
7732,BOOK XIV.,"rope, and themselves went ashore, and hasted to take supper by the"
7733,BOOK XIV.,"sea-banks. Meanwhile the gods themselves lightly unclasped my bands,"
7734,BOOK XIV.,"and muffling my head with the wrap I slid down the smooth lading-plank,"
7735,BOOK XIV.,"and set my breast to the sea and rowed hard with both hands as I swam,"
7736,BOOK XIV.,and very soon I was out of the water and beyond their reach. Then I
7737,BOOK XIV.,"went up where there was a thicket, a wood in full leaf, and lay there"
7738,BOOK XIV.,crouching. And they went hither and thither making great moan; but when
7739,BOOK XIV.,"now it seemed to them little avail to go further on their quest, they"
7740,BOOK XIV.,departed back again aboard their hollow ship. And the gods themselves
7741,BOOK XIV.,hid me easily and brought me nigh to the homestead of a wise man; for
7742,BOOK XIV.,"still, methinks, I am ordained to live on.”"
7743,BOOK XIV.,
7744,BOOK XIV.,"Then didst thou make answer to him, swineherd Eumaeus: “Ah! wretched"
7745,BOOK XIV.,"guest, verily thou hast stirred my heart with the tale of all these"
7746,BOOK XIV.,"things, of thy sufferings and thy wanderings. Yet herein, methinks,"
7747,BOOK XIV.,"thou speakest not aright, and never shalt thou persuade me with the"
7748,BOOK XIV.,tale about Odysseus; why should one in thy plight lie vainly? Well I
7749,BOOK XIV.,"know of mine own self, as touching my lord’s return, that he was"
7750,BOOK XIV.,"utterly hated by all the gods, in that they smote him not among the"
7751,BOOK XIV.,"Trojans nor in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the clew"
7752,BOOK XIV.,of war. So should the whole Achaean host have builded him a barrow; yea
7753,BOOK XIV.,and for his son would he have won great glory in the after days; but
7754,BOOK XIV.,now all ingloriously the spirits of the storm have snatched him away.
7755,BOOK XIV.,"But as for me I dwell apart by the swine and go not to the city, unless"
7756,BOOK XIV.,"perchance wise Penelope summons me thither, when tidings of my master"
7757,BOOK XIV.,are brought I know not whence. Now all the people sit round and
7758,BOOK XIV.,"straitly question the news-bearer, both such as grieve for their lord"
7759,BOOK XIV.,"that is long gone, and such as rejoice in devouring his living without"
7760,BOOK XIV.,"atonement. But I have no care to ask or to inquire, since the day that"
7761,BOOK XIV.,"an Aetolian cheated me with his story, one who had slain his man and"
7762,BOOK XIV.,"wandered over wide lands and came to my steading, and I dealt lovingly"
7763,BOOK XIV.,with him. He said that he had seen my master among the Cretans at the
7764,BOOK XIV.,"house of Idomeneus, mending his ships which the storms had broken. And"
7765,BOOK XIV.,he said that he would come home either by the summer or the
7766,BOOK XIV.,"harvest-tide, bringing much wealth with the godlike men of his company."
7767,BOOK XIV.,"And thou too, old man of many sorrows, seeing that some god hath"
7768,BOOK XIV.,"brought thee to me, seek not my grace with lies, nor give me any such"
7769,BOOK XIV.,"comfort; not for this will I have respect to thee or hold thee dear,"
7770,BOOK XIV.,"but only for the fear of Zeus, the god of strangers, and for pity of"
7771,BOOK XIV.,thyself.”
7772,BOOK XIV.,
7773,BOOK XIV.,And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Verily thy heart
7774,BOOK XIV.,"within thee is slow to believe, seeing that even with an oath I have"
7775,BOOK XIV.,"not won thee, nor find credence with thee. But come now, let us make a"
7776,BOOK XIV.,"covenant; and we will each one have for witnesses the gods above, who"
7777,BOOK XIV.,"hold Olympus. If thy lord shall return to this house, put on me a"
7778,BOOK XIV.,"mantle and doublet for raiment, and send me on my way to Dulichium,"
7779,BOOK XIV.,whither I had a desire to go. But if thy lord return not according to
7780,BOOK XIV.,"my word, set thy thralls upon me, and cast me down from a mighty rock,"
7781,BOOK XIV.,that another beggar in his turn may beware of deceiving.”
7782,BOOK XIV.,
7783,BOOK XIV.,"And the goodly swineherd answered him, saying: “Yea stranger, even so"
7784,BOOK XIV.,should I get much honour and good luck among men both now and ever
7785,BOOK XIV.,"hereafter, if after bringing thee to my hut and giving thee a"
7786,BOOK XIV.,"stranger’s cheer, I should turn again and slay thee and take away thy"
7787,BOOK XIV.,dear life. Eager indeed thereafter should I be to make a prayer to Zeus
7788,BOOK XIV.,"the son of Cronos! But now it is supper-time, and would that my fellows"
7789,BOOK XIV.,"may speedily be at home, that we may make ready a dainty supper within"
7790,BOOK XIV.,the hut.”
7791,BOOK XIV.,
7792,BOOK XIV.,"Thus they spake one to the other. And lo, the swine and the swineherds"
7793,BOOK XIV.,"drew nigh. And the swine they shut up to sleep in their lairs, and a"
7794,BOOK XIV.,mighty din arose as the swine were being stalled. Then the goodly
7795,BOOK XIV.,"swineherd called to his fellows, saying:"
7796,BOOK XIV.,
7797,BOOK XIV.,"“Bring the best of the swine, that I may sacrifice it for a guest of"
7798,BOOK XIV.,"mine from a far land: and we too will have good cheer therewith, for we"
7799,BOOK XIV.,"have long suffered and toiled by reason of the white-tusked swine,"
7800,BOOK XIV.,while others devour the fruit of our labour without atonement.”
7801,BOOK XIV.,
7802,BOOK XIV.,"Therewithal he cleft logs with the pitiless axe, and the others brought"
7803,BOOK XIV.,in a well-fatted boar of five years old; and they set him by the hearth
7804,BOOK XIV.,"nor did the swineherd forget the deathless gods, for he was of an"
7805,BOOK XIV.,understanding heart. But for a beginning of sacrifice he cast bristles
7806,BOOK XIV.,"from the head of the white-tusked boar upon the fire, and prayed to all"
7807,BOOK XIV.,the gods that wise Odysseus might return to his own house. Then he
7808,BOOK XIV.,"stood erect, and smote the boar with a billet of oak which he had left"
7809,BOOK XIV.,"in the cleaving, and the boar yielded up his life. Then they cut the"
7810,BOOK XIV.,"throat and singed the carcass and quickly cut it up, and the swineherd"
7811,BOOK XIV.,"took a first portion from all the limbs, and laid the raw flesh on the"
7812,BOOK XIV.,rich fat. And some pieces he cast into the fire after sprinkling them
7813,BOOK XIV.,"with bruised barley-meal, and they cut the rest up small, and pierced"
7814,BOOK XIV.,"it, and spitted and roasted it carefully, and drew it all off from the"
7815,BOOK XIV.,"spits, and put the whole mess together on trenchers. Then the swineherd"
7816,BOOK XIV.,"stood up to carve, for well he knew what was fair, and he cut up the"
7817,BOOK XIV.,"whole and divided it into seven portions. One, when he had prayed, he"
7818,BOOK XIV.,"set aside for the nymphs and for Hermes son of Maia, and the rest he"
7819,BOOK XIV.,"distributed to each. And he gave Odysseus the portion of honour, the"
7820,BOOK XIV.,"long back of the white-tusked boar, and the soul of his lord rejoiced"
7821,BOOK XIV.,"at this renown, and Odysseus of many counsels hailed him saying:"
7822,BOOK XIV.,
7823,BOOK XIV.,"“Eumaeus, oh that thou mayest so surely be dear to father Zeus, as thou"
7824,BOOK XIV.,"art to me, seeing that thou honourest me with a good portion, such an"
7825,BOOK XIV.,one as I am!”
7826,BOOK XIV.,
7827,BOOK XIV.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus:"
7828,BOOK XIV.,
7829,BOOK XIV.,"“Eat, luckless stranger, and make merry with such fare as is here. And"
7830,BOOK XIV.,"one thing the god will give and another withhold, even as he will, for"
7831,BOOK XIV.,with him all things are possible.”
7832,BOOK XIV.,
7833,BOOK XIV.,"So he spake, and made burnt offering of the hallowed parts to the"
7834,BOOK XIV.,"everlasting gods, and poured the dark wine for a drink offering, and"
7835,BOOK XIV.,"set the cup in the hands of Odysseus, the waster of cities, and sat"
7836,BOOK XIV.,"down by his own mess. And Mesaulius bare them wheaten bread, a thrall"
7837,BOOK XIV.,"that the swineherd had gotten all alone, while his lord was away,"
7838,BOOK XIV.,without the knowledge of his mistress and the old Laertes: yea he had
7839,BOOK XIV.,bought him of the Taphians with his own substance. So they stretched
7840,BOOK XIV.,forth their hands upon the good cheer spread before them. Now after
7841,BOOK XIV.,"they had put from them the desire of meat and drink, Mesaulius cleared"
7842,BOOK XIV.,"away the bread, and they, now that they had eaten enough of bread and"
7843,BOOK XIV.,"flesh, were moved to go to rest."
7844,BOOK XIV.,
7845,BOOK XIV.,"Now it was so that night came on foul with a blind moon, and Zeus"
7846,BOOK XIV.,"rained the whole night through, and still the great West Wind, the"
7847,BOOK XIV.,"rainy wind, was blowing. Then Odysseus spake among them that he might"
7848,BOOK XIV.,"make trial of the swineherd, and see whether he would take off his own"
7849,BOOK XIV.,"mantle and give it to him or bid one of his company strip, since he"
7850,BOOK XIV.,cared for him so greatly:
7851,BOOK XIV.,
7852,BOOK XIV.,"“Listen now, Eumaeus, and all of you his companions, with a prayer will"
7853,BOOK XIV.,"I utter my word; so bids me witless wine, which drives even the wisest"
7854,BOOK XIV.,"to sing and to laugh softly, and rouses him to dance, yea and makes him"
7855,BOOK XIV.,"to speak out a word which were better unspoken. Howbeit, now that I"
7856,BOOK XIV.,"have broken into speech, I will not hide aught. Oh that I were young,"
7857,BOOK XIV.,"and my might were steadfast, as in the day when we arrayed our ambush"
7858,BOOK XIV.,"and led it beneath Troy town! And Odysseus, and Menelaus son of Atreus,"
7859,BOOK XIV.,were leaders and with them I was a third in command; for so they bade
7860,BOOK XIV.,"me. Now when we had come to the city and the steep wall, we lay about"
7861,BOOK XIV.,"the citadel in the thick brushwood, crouching under our arms among the"
7862,BOOK XIV.,"reeds and the marsh land, and behold, the night came on foul, with"
7863,BOOK XIV.,"frost, as the North Wind went down, while the snow fell from above, and"
7864,BOOK XIV.,"crusted like rime, bitter cold, and the ice set thick about our"
7865,BOOK XIV.,"shields. Now the others all had mantles and doublets, and slept in"
7866,BOOK XIV.,peace with their shields buckled close about their shoulders; but I as
7867,BOOK XIV.,"I went forth had left my mantle behind with my men, in my folly,"
7868,BOOK XIV.,thinking that even so I should not be cold: so I came with only my
7869,BOOK XIV.,shield and bright leathern apron. But when it was now the third watch
7870,BOOK XIV.,"of the night and the stars had passed the zenith, in that hour I spake"
7871,BOOK XIV.,"unto Odysseus who was nigh me, and thrust him with my elbow, and he"
7872,BOOK XIV.,listened straightway:
7873,BOOK XIV.,
7874,BOOK XIV.,"“‘Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, verily"
7875,BOOK XIV.,"I shall cease from among living men, for this wintry cold is slaying"
7876,BOOK XIV.,"me, seeing that I have no mantle. Some god beguiled me to wear a"
7877,BOOK XIV.,"doublet only, and henceforth is no way of escape.’"
7878,BOOK XIV.,
7879,BOOK XIV.,"“So I spake, and he apprehended a thought in his heart, such an one as"
7880,BOOK XIV.,"he was in counsel and in fight. So he whispered and spake to me,"
7881,BOOK XIV.,saying:
7882,BOOK XIV.,
7883,BOOK XIV.,"“‘Be silent now, lest some other Achaeans hear thee.’ Therewith he"
7884,BOOK XIV.,"raised his head upon his elbow, and spake, saying: ‘Listen, friends, a"
7885,BOOK XIV.,"vision from a god came to me in my sleep. Lo, we have come very far"
7886,BOOK XIV.,"from the ships; I would there were one to tell it to Agamemnon, son of"
7887,BOOK XIV.,"Atreus, shepherd of the host, if perchance he may send us hither a"
7888,BOOK XIV.,greater company from the ships.’
7889,BOOK XIV.,
7890,BOOK XIV.,"“So spake he, and Thoas, son of Andraemon, rose up quickly and cast off"
7891,BOOK XIV.,"his purple mantle. And he started to run unto the ships, but I lay"
7892,BOOK XIV.,"gladly in his garment, and the golden-throned Dawn showed her light."
7893,BOOK XIV.,Oh! that I were young as then and my might steadfast! Then should some
7894,BOOK XIV.,"of the swineherds in the homestead give me a mantle, alike for love’s"
7895,BOOK XIV.,sake and for pity of a good warrior. But now they scorn me for that
7896,BOOK XIV.,sorry raiment is about my body.”
7897,BOOK XIV.,
7898,BOOK XIV.,"Then didst thou make answer, O swineherd Eumaeus: “Old man, the tale"
7899,BOOK XIV.,"that thou hast told in his praise is very good, and so far thou hast"
7900,BOOK XIV.,"not misspoken aught, nor uttered a word unprofitably. Wherefore for"
7901,BOOK XIV.,this night thou shalt lack neither raiment nor aught else that is the
7902,BOOK XIV.,"due of a hapless suppliant, when he has met them that can befriend him."
7903,BOOK XIV.,"But in the morning thou shalt go shuffling in thine own rags, for there"
7904,BOOK XIV.,are not many mantles here or changes of doublet; for each man hath but
7905,BOOK XIV.,"one coat. But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he himself will give"
7906,BOOK XIV.,"thee a mantle and doublet for raiment, and send thee whithersoever thy"
7907,BOOK XIV.,heart and spirit bid.”
7908,BOOK XIV.,
7909,BOOK XIV.,"With that he sprang up and set a bed for Odysseus near the fire, and"
7910,BOOK XIV.,thereon he cast skins of sheep and goats. There Odysseus laid him down
7911,BOOK XIV.,"and Eumaeus cast a great thick mantle over him, which he had ever by"
7912,BOOK XIV.,"him for a change of covering, when any terrible storm should arise."
7913,BOOK XIV.,
7914,BOOK XIV.,"So there Odysseus slept, and the young men slept beside him. But the"
7915,BOOK XIV.,swineherd had no mind to lie there in a bed away from the boars. So he
7916,BOOK XIV.,"made him ready to go forth and Odysseus was glad, because he had a"
7917,BOOK XIV.,great care for his master’s substance while he was afar. First he cast
7918,BOOK XIV.,"his sharp sword about his strong shoulders, then he clad him in a very"
7919,BOOK XIV.,"thick mantle, to keep the wind away; and he caught up the fleece of a"
7920,BOOK XIV.,"great and well-fed goat, and seized his sharp javelin, to defend him"
7921,BOOK XIV.,against dogs and men. Then he went to lay him down even where the
7922,BOOK XIV.,"white-tusked boars were sleeping, beneath the hollow of the rock, in a"
7923,BOOK XIV.,place of shelter from the North Wind.

7928,BOOK XV.,
7929,BOOK XV.,
7930,BOOK XV.,Pallas sends home Telemachus from Lacedaemon with the presents given
7931,BOOK XV.,"him by Menelaus. Telemachus landed, goes first to Eumaeus."
7932,BOOK XV.,
7933,BOOK XV.,
7934,BOOK XV.,"Now Pallas Athene went to the wide land of Lacedaemon, to put the noble"
7935,BOOK XV.,"son of the great-hearted Odysseus in mind of his return, and to make"
7936,BOOK XV.,"him hasten his coming. And she found Telemachus, and the glorious son"
7937,BOOK XV.,"of Nestor, couched at the vestibule of the house of famous Menelaus."
7938,BOOK XV.,"The son of Nestor truly was overcome with soft sleep, but sweet sleep"
7939,BOOK XV.,"gat not hold of Telemachus, but, through the night divine, careful"
7940,BOOK XV.,thoughts for his father kept him wakeful. And grey-eyed Athene stood
7941,BOOK XV.,"nigh him and spake to him, saying:"
7942,BOOK XV.,
7943,BOOK XV.,"“Telemachus, it is no longer meet that thou shouldest wander far from"
7944,BOOK XV.,"thy home, leaving thy substance behind thee, and men in thy house so"
7945,BOOK XV.,"wanton, lest they divide and utterly devour all thy wealth, and thou"
7946,BOOK XV.,"shalt have gone on a vain journey. But come, rouse with all haste"
7947,BOOK XV.,"Menelaus, of the loud war-cry, to send thee on thy way, that thou"
7948,BOOK XV.,mayest even yet find thy noble mother in her home. For even now her
7949,BOOK XV.,"father and her brethren bid her wed Eurymachus, for he outdoes all the"
7950,BOOK XV.,"wooers in his presents, and hath been greatly increasing his gifts of"
7951,BOOK XV.,wooing. So shall she take no treasure from thy house despite thy will.
7952,BOOK XV.,Thou knowest of what sort is the heart of a woman within her; all her
7953,BOOK XV.,"desire is to increase the house of the man who takes her to wife, but"
7954,BOOK XV.,of her former children and of her own dear lord she has no more memory
7955,BOOK XV.,"once he is dead, and she asks concerning him no more. Go then, and"
7956,BOOK XV.,thyself place all thy substance in the care of the handmaid who seems
7957,BOOK XV.,"to thee the best, till the day when the gods shall show thee a glorious"
7958,BOOK XV.,"bride. Now another word will I tell thee, and do thou lay it up in"
7959,BOOK XV.,"thine heart. The noblest of the wooers lie in wait for thee of purpose,"
7960,BOOK XV.,"in the strait between Ithaca and rugged Samos, eager to slay thee"
7961,BOOK XV.,"before thou come to thine own country. But this, methinks, will never"
7962,BOOK XV.,"be; yea, sooner shall the earth close over certain of the wooers that"
7963,BOOK XV.,"devour thy livelihood. Nay, keep thy well-wrought ship far from those"
7964,BOOK XV.,"isles, and sail by night as well as day, and he of the immortals who"
7965,BOOK XV.,hath thee in his keeping and protection will send thee a fair breeze in
7966,BOOK XV.,"thy wake. But when thou hast touched the nearest shore of Ithaca, send"
7967,BOOK XV.,"thy ship and all thy company forward to the city, but for thy part seek"
7968,BOOK XV.,"first the swineherd who keeps thy swine, loyal and at one with thee."
7969,BOOK XV.,"There do thou rest the night, and bid him go to the city to bear"
7970,BOOK XV.,"tidings of thy coming to the wise Penelope, how that she hath got thee"
7971,BOOK XV.,"safe, and thou art come up out of Pylos.”"
7972,BOOK XV.,
7973,BOOK XV.,Therewith she departed to high Olympus. But Telemachus woke the son of
7974,BOOK XV.,"Nestor out of sweet sleep, touching him with his heel, and spake to"
7975,BOOK XV.,"him, saying:"
7976,BOOK XV.,
7977,BOOK XV.,"“Awake, Peisistratus, son of Nestor, bring up thy horses of solid hoof,"
7978,BOOK XV.,"and yoke them beneath the car, that we may get forward on the road.”"
7979,BOOK XV.,
7980,BOOK XV.,"Then Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him, saying: “Telemachus, we"
7981,BOOK XV.,"may in no wise drive through the dark night, how eager soever to be"
7982,BOOK XV.,"gone; nay, soon it will be dawn. Tarry then, till the hero, the son of"
7983,BOOK XV.,"Atreus, spear-famed Menelaus, brings gifts, and sets them on the car,"
7984,BOOK XV.,"and bespeaks thee kindly, and sends thee on thy way. For of him a guest"
7985,BOOK XV.,"is mindful all the days of his life, even of the host that shows him"
7986,BOOK XV.,loving-kindness.”
7987,BOOK XV.,
7988,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, and anon came the golden-throned Dawn. And Menelaus, of"
7989,BOOK XV.,"the loud war cry, drew nigh to them, new risen from his bed, by"
7990,BOOK XV.,"fair-haired Helen. Now when the dear son of Odysseus marked him, he"
7991,BOOK XV.,"made haste and girt his shining doublet about him, and the hero cast a"
7992,BOOK XV.,"great mantle over his mighty shoulders, and went forth at the door, and"
7993,BOOK XV.,"Telemachus, dear son of divine Odysseus, came up and spake to Menelaus,"
7994,BOOK XV.,saying:
7995,BOOK XV.,
7996,BOOK XV.,"“Menelaus, son of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the people,"
7997,BOOK XV.,"even now do thou speed me hence, to mine own dear country; for even now"
7998,BOOK XV.,my heart is fain to come home again.”
7999,BOOK XV.,
8000,BOOK XV.,"Then Menelaus, of the loud war cry, answered him: “Telemachus, as for"
8001,BOOK XV.,"me, I will not hold thee a long time here, that art eager to return;"
8002,BOOK XV.,"nay, I think it shame even in another host, who loves overmuch or hates"
8003,BOOK XV.,overmuch. Measure is best in all things. He does equal wrong who speeds
8004,BOOK XV.,"a guest that would fain abide, and stays one who is in haste to be"
8005,BOOK XV.,gone. Men should lovingly entreat the present guest and speed the
8006,BOOK XV.,parting. But abide till I bring fair gifts and set them on the car and
8007,BOOK XV.,"thine own eyes behold them, and I bid the women to prepare the midday"
8008,BOOK XV.,"meal in the halls, out of the good store they have within. Honour and"
8009,BOOK XV.,"glory it is for us, and gain withal for thee, that ye should have eaten"
8010,BOOK XV.,"well ere ye go on your way, over vast and limitless lands. What and if"
8011,BOOK XV.,thou art minded to pass through Hellas and mid Argos? So shall I too go
8012,BOOK XV.,"with thee, and yoke thee horses and lead thee to the towns of men, and"
8013,BOOK XV.,"none shall send us empty away, but will give us some one thing to take"
8014,BOOK XV.,"with us, either a tripod of goodly bronze or a cauldron, or two mules"
8015,BOOK XV.,or a golden chalice.”
8016,BOOK XV.,
8017,BOOK XV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him saying: “Menelaus, son of Atreus,"
8018,BOOK XV.,"fosterling of Zeus, leader of the people, rather would I return even"
8019,BOOK XV.,"now to mine own land, for I left none behind to watch over my goods"
8020,BOOK XV.,when I departed. I would not that I myself should perish on the quest
8021,BOOK XV.,"of my godlike father, nor that any good heir-loom should be lost from"
8022,BOOK XV.,my halls.”
8023,BOOK XV.,
8024,BOOK XV.,"Now when Menelaus, of the loud war cry, heard this saying, straightway"
8025,BOOK XV.,"he bade his wife and maids to prepare the midday meal in the halls, out"
8026,BOOK XV.,"of the good store they had by them. Then Eteoneus, son of Boethous,"
8027,BOOK XV.,"came nigh him, just risen from his bed, for he abode not far from him."
8028,BOOK XV.,Him Menelaus of the loud war cry bade kindle the fire and roast of the
8029,BOOK XV.,flesh; and he hearkened and obeyed. Then the prince went down into the
8030,BOOK XV.,"fragrant treasure chamber, not alone, for Helen went with him, and"
8031,BOOK XV.,"Megapenthes. Now, when they came to the place where the treasures were"
8032,BOOK XV.,"stored, then Atrides took a two-handled cup, and bade his son"
8033,BOOK XV.,Megapenthes to bear a mixing bowl of silver. And Helen stood by the
8034,BOOK XV.,"coffers, wherein were her robes of curious needlework which she herself"
8035,BOOK XV.,"had wrought. Then Helen, the fair lady, lifted one and brought it out,"
8036,BOOK XV.,"the widest and most beautifully embroidered of all, and it shone like a"
8037,BOOK XV.,"star, and lay far beneath the rest."
8038,BOOK XV.,
8039,BOOK XV.,Then they went forth through the house till they came to Telemachus;
8040,BOOK XV.,"and Menelaus, of the fair hair, spake to him saying:"
8041,BOOK XV.,
8042,BOOK XV.,"“Telemachus, may Zeus the thunderer, and the lord of Here, in very"
8043,BOOK XV.,truth bring about thy return according to the desire of thy heart. And
8044,BOOK XV.,"of the gifts, such as are treasures stored in my house, I will give"
8045,BOOK XV.,thee the goodliest and greatest of price. I will give thee a mixing
8046,BOOK XV.,bowl beautifully wrought; it is all of silver and the lips thereof are
8047,BOOK XV.,"finished with gold, the work of Hephaestus; and the hero Phaedimus the"
8048,BOOK XV.,"king of the Sidonians, gave it to me when his house sheltered me, on my"
8049,BOOK XV.,coming thither. This cup I would give to thee.”
8050,BOOK XV.,
8051,BOOK XV.,Therewith the hero Atrides set the two-handled cup in his hands. And
8052,BOOK XV.,the strong Megapenthes bare the shining silver bowl and set it before
8053,BOOK XV.,"him. And Helen came up, beautiful Helen, with the robe in her hands,"
8054,BOOK XV.,and spake and hailed him:
8055,BOOK XV.,
8056,BOOK XV.,"“Lo! I too give thee this gift, dear child, a memorial of the hands of"
8057,BOOK XV.,"Helen, against the day of thy desire, even of thy bridal, for thy bride"
8058,BOOK XV.,to wear it. But meanwhile let it lie by thy dear mother in her chamber.
8059,BOOK XV.,"And may joy go with thee to thy well-builded house, and thine own"
8060,BOOK XV.,country.”
8061,BOOK XV.,
8062,BOOK XV.,"With that she put it into his hands, and he took it and was glad. And"
8063,BOOK XV.,the hero Peisistratus took the gifts and laid them in the chest of the
8064,BOOK XV.,"car, and gazed on all and wondered. Then Menelaus of the fair hair led"
8065,BOOK XV.,them to the house. Then they twain sat them down on chairs and high
8066,BOOK XV.,"seats, and a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly golden ewer,"
8067,BOOK XV.,"and poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal, and drew to"
8068,BOOK XV.,their side a polished table. And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and
8069,BOOK XV.,"set it by them, and laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of"
8070,BOOK XV.,such things as she had by her. And the son of Boethous carved by the
8071,BOOK XV.,"board and divided the messes, and the son of renowned Menelaus poured"
8072,BOOK XV.,forth the wine. So they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer
8073,BOOK XV.,set before them. Now when they had put from them the desire of meat and
8074,BOOK XV.,"drink, then did Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor yoke the"
8075,BOOK XV.,horses and climb into the inlaid car. And they drave forth from the
8076,BOOK XV.,"gateway and the echoing gallery. After these Menelaus, of the fair"
8077,BOOK XV.,"hair, the son of Atreus, went forth bearing in his right hand a golden"
8078,BOOK XV.,"cup of honey-hearted wine, that they might pour a drink-offering ere"
8079,BOOK XV.,they departed. And he stood before the horses and spake his greeting:
8080,BOOK XV.,
8081,BOOK XV.,"“Farewell, knightly youths, and salute in my name Nestor, the shepherd"
8082,BOOK XV.,"of the people; for truly he was gentle to me as a father, while we sons"
8083,BOOK XV.,of the Achaeans warred in the land of Troy.”
8084,BOOK XV.,
8085,BOOK XV.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Yea verily, O fosterling of"
8086,BOOK XV.,"Zeus, we will tell him all on our coming even as thou sayest. Would God"
8087,BOOK XV.,that when I return to Ithaca I may find Odysseus in his home and tell
8088,BOOK XV.,"him all, so surely as now I go on my way having met with all"
8089,BOOK XV.,"loving-kindness at thy hands, and take with me treasures many and"
8090,BOOK XV.,goodly!”
8091,BOOK XV.,
8092,BOOK XV.,"And even as he spake a bird flew forth at his right hand, an eagle that"
8093,BOOK XV.,"bare in his claws a great white goose, a tame fowl from the yard, and"
8094,BOOK XV.,men and women followed shouting. But the bird drew near them and flew
8095,BOOK XV.,"off to the right, across the horses, and they that saw it were glad,"
8096,BOOK XV.,"and their hearts were all comforted within them. And Peisistratus, son"
8097,BOOK XV.,"of Nestor, first spake among them:"
8098,BOOK XV.,
8099,BOOK XV.,"“Consider, Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the people, whether"
8100,BOOK XV.,"god hath showed forth this sign for us twain, or for thee thyself.”"
8101,BOOK XV.,
8102,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, and the warrior Menelaus pondered thereupon, how he should"
8103,BOOK XV.,"take heed to answer, and interpret it aright."
8104,BOOK XV.,
8105,BOOK XV.,"And long-robed Helen took the word and spake, saying: “Hear me, and I"
8106,BOOK XV.,"will prophesy as the immortals put it into my heart, and as I deem it"
8107,BOOK XV.,"will be accomplished. Even as yonder eagle came down from the hill, the"
8108,BOOK XV.,"place of his birth and kin, and snatched away the goose that was"
8109,BOOK XV.,"fostered in the house, even so shall Odysseus return home after much"
8110,BOOK XV.,"trial and long wanderings and take vengeance; yea, or even now is he at"
8111,BOOK XV.,home and sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers.”
8112,BOOK XV.,
8113,BOOK XV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “Now may Zeus ordain it so,"
8114,BOOK XV.,"Zeus the thunderer and the lord of Here. Then would I do thee worship,"
8115,BOOK XV.,"as to a god, even in my home afar.”"
8116,BOOK XV.,
8117,BOOK XV.,"He spake and smote the horses with the lash, and they sped quickly"
8118,BOOK XV.,"towards the plain, in eager course through the city. So all day long"
8119,BOOK XV.,"they swayed the yoke they bore upon their necks. And the sun sank, and"
8120,BOOK XV.,"all the ways were darkened. And they came to Pherae, to the house of"
8121,BOOK XV.,"Diocles, son of Orsilochus, the child begotten of Alpheus. There they"
8122,BOOK XV.,"rested for the night, and by them he set the entertainment of"
8123,BOOK XV.,strangers.
8124,BOOK XV.,
8125,BOOK XV.,"Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, they yoked"
8126,BOOK XV.,the horses and mounted the inlaid car. And forth they drave from the
8127,BOOK XV.,gateway and the echoing gallery. And he touched the horses with the
8128,BOOK XV.,"whip to start them, and the pair flew onward nothing loth. And soon"
8129,BOOK XV.,thereafter they reached the steep hold of Pylos. Then Telemachus spake
8130,BOOK XV.,"unto the son of Nestor, saying:"
8131,BOOK XV.,
8132,BOOK XV.,"“Son of Nestor, in what wise mightest thou make me a promise and fulfil"
8133,BOOK XV.,my bidding? For we claim to be friends by reason of our fathers’
8134,BOOK XV.,"friendship from of old. Moreover we are equals in age, and this journey"
8135,BOOK XV.,"shall turn to our greater love. Take me not hence past my ship, O"
8136,BOOK XV.,"fosterling of Zeus, but leave me there, lest that old man keep me in"
8137,BOOK XV.,"his house in my despite, out of his eager kindness, for I must go right"
8138,BOOK XV.,quickly home.”
8139,BOOK XV.,
8140,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, and the some of Nestor communed with his own heart how he"
8141,BOOK XV.,"might make promise, and duly fulfil the same. So as he thought thereon,"
8142,BOOK XV.,in this wise it seemed to him best. He turned back his horses toward
8143,BOOK XV.,"the swift ship and the sea-banks, and took forth the fair gifts and set"
8144,BOOK XV.,"them in the hinder part of the ship, the raiment and the gold which"
8145,BOOK XV.,Menelaus gave him. And he called to Telemachus and spake to him winged
8146,BOOK XV.,words:
8147,BOOK XV.,
8148,BOOK XV.,"“Now climb the ship with all haste, and bid all thy company do"
8149,BOOK XV.,"likewise, ere I reach home and bring the old man word. For well I know"
8150,BOOK XV.,"in my mind and heart that, being so wilful of heart, he will not let"
8151,BOOK XV.,"thee go, but he himself will come hither to bid thee to his house, and"
8152,BOOK XV.,methinks that he will not go back without thee; for very wroth will he
8153,BOOK XV.,be despite thine excuse.”
8154,BOOK XV.,
8155,BOOK XV.,"Thus he spake, and drave the horses with the flowing manes back to the"
8156,BOOK XV.,"town of the Pylians, and came quickly to the halls. And Telemachus"
8157,BOOK XV.,"called to his companions and commanded them, saying:"
8158,BOOK XV.,
8159,BOOK XV.,"“Set ye the gear in order, my friends, in the black ship, and let us"
8160,BOOK XV.,climb aboard that we may make way upon our course.”
8161,BOOK XV.,
8162,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, and they gave good heed and hearkened. Then straightway"
8163,BOOK XV.,they embarked and sat upon the benches.
8164,BOOK XV.,
8165,BOOK XV.,Thus was he busy hereat and praying and making burnt-offering to
8166,BOOK XV.,"Athene, by the stern of the ship, when there drew nigh him one from a"
8167,BOOK XV.,"far country, that had slain his man and was fleeing from out of Argos."
8168,BOOK XV.,"He was a soothsayer, and by his lineage he came of Melampus, who of old"
8169,BOOK XV.,"time abode in Pylos, mother of flocks, a rich man and one that had an"
8170,BOOK XV.,"exceeding goodly house among the Pylians, but afterward he had come to"
8171,BOOK XV.,"the land of strangers, fleeing from his country and from Neleus, the"
8172,BOOK XV.,"great-hearted, the proudest of living men, who kept all his goods for a"
8173,BOOK XV.,full year by force. All that time Melampus lay bound with hard bonds in
8174,BOOK XV.,"the halls of Phylacus, suffering strong pains for the sake of the"
8175,BOOK XV.,"daughter of Neleus, and for the dread blindness of soul which the"
8176,BOOK XV.,"goddess, the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke, had laid on him. Howsoever"
8177,BOOK XV.,"he escaped his fate, and drave away the lowing kine from Phylace to"
8178,BOOK XV.,"Pylos, and avenged the foul deed upon godlike Neleus, and brought the"
8179,BOOK XV.,"maiden home to his own brother to wife. As for him, he went to a"
8180,BOOK XV.,"country of other men, to Argos, the pastureland of horses; for there"
8181,BOOK XV.,"truly it was ordained that he should dwell, bearing rule over many of"
8182,BOOK XV.,"the Argives. There he wedded a wife, and builded him a lofty house, and"
8183,BOOK XV.,"begat Antiphates and Mantius, two mighty sons. Now Antiphates begat"
8184,BOOK XV.,"Oicles the great-hearted, and Oicles Amphiaraus, the rouser of the"
8185,BOOK XV.,"host, whom Zeus, lord of the aegis, and Apollo loved with all manner of"
8186,BOOK XV.,"love. Yet he reached not the threshold of old age, but died in Thebes"
8187,BOOK XV.,by reason of a woman’s gifts. And the sons born to him were Alcmaeon
8188,BOOK XV.,and Amphilochus. But Mantius begat Polypheides and Cleitus; but it came
8189,BOOK XV.,to pass that the golden-throned Dawn snatched away Cleitus for his very
8190,BOOK XV.,"beauty’s sake, that he might dwell with the Immortals."
8191,BOOK XV.,
8192,BOOK XV.,"And Apollo made the high-souled Polypheides a seer, far the chief of"
8193,BOOK XV.,"human kind, Amphiaraus being now dead. He removed his dwelling to"
8194,BOOK XV.,"Hypheresia, being angered with his father, and here he abode and"
8195,BOOK XV.,prophesied to all men.
8196,BOOK XV.,
8197,BOOK XV.,"This man’s son it was, Theoclymenus by name, that now drew nigh and"
8198,BOOK XV.,stood by Telemachus. And he found him pouring a drink-offering and
8199,BOOK XV.,"praying by the swift black ship, and uttering his voice he spake to him"
8200,BOOK XV.,winged words:
8201,BOOK XV.,
8202,BOOK XV.,"“Friend, since I find thee making burnt-offering in this place, I pray"
8203,BOOK XV.,"thee, by thine offerings and by the god, and thereafter by thine own"
8204,BOOK XV.,"head, and in the name of the men of thy company answer my question"
8205,BOOK XV.,truly and hide it not. Who art thou of the sons of men and whence?
8206,BOOK XV.,"Where is thy city, where are they that begat thee?”"
8207,BOOK XV.,
8208,BOOK XV.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Yea now, stranger, I will"
8209,BOOK XV.,"plainly tell thee all. Of Ithaca am I by lineage, and my father is"
8210,BOOK XV.,"Odysseus, if ever such an one there was, but now hath he perished by an"
8211,BOOK XV.,"evil fate. Wherefore I have taken my company and a black ship, and have"
8212,BOOK XV.,gone forth to hear word of my father that has been long afar.”
8213,BOOK XV.,
8214,BOOK XV.,Then godlike Theoclymenus spake to him again: “Even so I too have fled
8215,BOOK XV.,"from my country, for the manslaying of one of mine own kin. And many"
8216,BOOK XV.,"brethren and kinsmen of the slain are in Argos, the pastureland of"
8217,BOOK XV.,"horses, and rule mightily over the Achaeans. Wherefore now am I an"
8218,BOOK XV.,"exile to shun death and black fate at their hands, for it is my doom"
8219,BOOK XV.,"yet to wander among men. Now set me on board ship, since I supplicate"
8220,BOOK XV.,"thee in my flight, lest they slay me utterly; for methinks they follow"
8221,BOOK XV.,hard after me.”
8222,BOOK XV.,
8223,BOOK XV.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Surely I will not drive thee"
8224,BOOK XV.,"away from our good ship, if thou art fain to come. Follow thou with us"
8225,BOOK XV.,"then, and in Ithaca thou shalt be welcome to such things as we have.”"
8226,BOOK XV.,
8227,BOOK XV.,"Therewith he took from him his spear of bronze, and laid it along the"
8228,BOOK XV.,"deck of the curved ship, and himself too climbed the seafaring ship."
8229,BOOK XV.,Then he sat him down in the stern and made Theoclymenus to sit beside
8230,BOOK XV.,him; and his company loosed the hawsers. Then Telemachus called unto
8231,BOOK XV.,"his company, and bade them lay hands on the tackling, and speedily they"
8232,BOOK XV.,"hearkened to his call. So they raised the mast of pine tree, and set it"
8233,BOOK XV.,"in the hole of the cross plank and made it fast with forestays, and"
8234,BOOK XV.,hauled up the white sails with twisted ropes of ox-hide. And grey-eyed
8235,BOOK XV.,"Athene sent them a favouring breeze, rushing violently through the"
8236,BOOK XV.,clear sky that the ship might speedily finish her course over the salt
8237,BOOK XV.,"water of the sea. So they passed by Crouni and Chalcis, a land of fair"
8238,BOOK XV.,streams.
8239,BOOK XV.,
8240,BOOK XV.,And the sun set and all the ways were darkened. And the vessel drew
8241,BOOK XV.,"nigh to Pheae, being sped before the breeze of Zeus, and then passed"
8242,BOOK XV.,goodly Elis where the Epeans bear rule. From thence he drave on again
8243,BOOK XV.,"to the Pointed Isles, pondering whether he should escape death or be"
8244,BOOK XV.,cut off.
8245,BOOK XV.,
8246,BOOK XV.,"Now Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were supping in the hut, and the"
8247,BOOK XV.,other men sat at meat with them. So when they had put from them the
8248,BOOK XV.,"desire of meat and drink, Odysseus spake among them, to prove the"
8249,BOOK XV.,"swineherd, whether he would still entertain him diligently, and bid him"
8250,BOOK XV.,abide there in the steading or send him forward to the city:
8251,BOOK XV.,
8252,BOOK XV.,"“Listen now, Eumaeus, and all the others of the company. In the morning"
8253,BOOK XV.,"I would fain be gone to the town to go a begging, that I be not ruinous"
8254,BOOK XV.,"to thyself and thy fellows. Now advise me well, and lend me a good"
8255,BOOK XV.,guide by the way to lead me thither; and through the city will I wander
8256,BOOK XV.,"alone as needs I must, if perchance one may give me a cup of water and"
8257,BOOK XV.,a morsel of bread. Moreover I would go to the house of divine Odysseus
8258,BOOK XV.,"and bear tidings to the wise Penelope, and consort with the wanton"
8259,BOOK XV.,"wooers, if haply they might grant me a meal out of the boundless store"
8260,BOOK XV.,"that they have by them. Lightly might I do good service among them,"
8261,BOOK XV.,even all that they would. For lo! I will tell thee and do thou mark and
8262,BOOK XV.,"listen. By the favour of Hermes, the messenger, who gives grace and"
8263,BOOK XV.,"glory to all men’s work, no mortal may vie with me in the business of a"
8264,BOOK XV.,"serving-man, in piling well a fire, in cleaving dry faggots, and in"
8265,BOOK XV.,"carving and roasting flesh and in pouring of wine, those offices"
8266,BOOK XV.,wherein meaner men serve their betters.”
8267,BOOK XV.,
8268,BOOK XV.,"Then didst thou speak to him in heaviness of heart, swineherd Eumaeus:"
8269,BOOK XV.,"“Ah! wherefore, stranger, hath such a thought arisen in thine heart?"
8270,BOOK XV.,"Surely thou art set on perishing utterly there, if thou wouldest indeed"
8271,BOOK XV.,"go into the throng of the wooers, whose outrage and violence reacheth"
8272,BOOK XV.,even to the iron heaven! Not such as thou are their servants; they that
8273,BOOK XV.,"minister to them are young and gaily clad in mantles and in doublets,"
8274,BOOK XV.,"and their heads are anointed with oil and they are fair of face, and"
8275,BOOK XV.,"the polished boards are laden with bread and flesh and wine. Nay, abide"
8276,BOOK XV.,"here, for none is vexed by thy presence, neither I nor any of my"
8277,BOOK XV.,"fellows that are with me. But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he"
8278,BOOK XV.,"himself will give thee a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and will"
8279,BOOK XV.,send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.”
8280,BOOK XV.,
8281,BOOK XV.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: “Oh, that thou mayst"
8282,BOOK XV.,"so surely be dear to father Zeus as thou art to me, in that thou didst"
8283,BOOK XV.,make me to cease from wandering and dread woe! For there is no other
8284,BOOK XV.,thing more mischievous to men than roaming; yet for their cursed
8285,BOOK XV.,"belly’s need men endure sore distress, to whom come wandering and"
8286,BOOK XV.,"tribulation and pain. But behold now, since thou stayest me here, and"
8287,BOOK XV.,"biddest me wait his coming, tell me of the mother of divine Odysseus,"
8288,BOOK XV.,and of the father whom at his departure he left behind him on the
8289,BOOK XV.,"threshold of old age; are they, it may be, yet alive beneath the"
8290,BOOK XV.,"sunlight, or already dead and within the house of Hades?”"
8291,BOOK XV.,
8292,BOOK XV.,"Then spake to him the swineherd, a master of men: “Yea now, stranger, I"
8293,BOOK XV.,"will plainly tell thee all. Laertes yet lives, and prays evermore to"
8294,BOOK XV.,Zeus that his life may waste from out his limbs within his halls. For
8295,BOOK XV.,"he has wondrous sorrow for his son that is far away, and for the wedded"
8296,BOOK XV.,"lady his wise wife, whose death afflicted him in chief and brought him"
8297,BOOK XV.,to old age before his day. Now she died of very grief for her son
8298,BOOK XV.,"renowned, by an evil death, so may no man perish who dwells here and is"
8299,BOOK XV.,"a friend to me in word and deed! So long as she was on earth, though in"
8300,BOOK XV.,"much sorrow, I was glad to ask and enquire concerning her, for that she"
8301,BOOK XV.,"herself had reared me along with long-robed Ctimene, her noble"
8302,BOOK XV.,"daughter, the youngest of her children. With her I was reared, and she"
8303,BOOK XV.,honoured me little less than her own. But when we both came to the time
8304,BOOK XV.,"of our desire, to the flower of age, thereupon they sent her to Same,"
8305,BOOK XV.,and got a great bride-price; but my lady clad me in a mantle and a
8306,BOOK XV.,"doublet, raiment very fair, and gave me sandals for my feet and sent me"
8307,BOOK XV.,"forth to the field, and right dear at heart she held me. But of these"
8308,BOOK XV.,things now at last am I lacking; yet the blessed gods prosper the work
8309,BOOK XV.,"of mine own hands, whereat I abide. Of this my substance I have eaten"
8310,BOOK XV.,and drunken and given to reverend strangers. But from my lady I may
8311,BOOK XV.,"hear naught pleasant, neither word nor deed, for evil hath fallen on"
8312,BOOK XV.,"her house, a plague of froward men; yet thralls have a great desire to"
8313,BOOK XV.,"speak before their mistress and find out all eat and drink, and"
8314,BOOK XV.,"moreover to carry off somewhat with them to the field, such things as"
8315,BOOK XV.,ever comfort the heart of a thrall.”
8316,BOOK XV.,
8317,BOOK XV.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Ah, Eumaeus, how"
8318,BOOK XV.,far then didst thou wander from thine own country and thy parents while
8319,BOOK XV.,"as yet thou wast but a child! But come, declare me this and plainly"
8320,BOOK XV.,"tell it all. Was a wide-wayed town of men taken and sacked, wherein"
8321,BOOK XV.,"dwelt thy father and thy lady mother, or did unfriendly men find thee"
8322,BOOK XV.,"lonely, tending sheep or cattle, and shipped thee thence, and sold thee"
8323,BOOK XV.,"into the house of thy master here, who paid for thee a goodly price?”"
8324,BOOK XV.,
8325,BOOK XV.,"Then spake to him the swineherd, a master of men: Stranger, since thou"
8326,BOOK XV.,"askest and questionest me hereof, give heed now in silence and make"
8327,BOOK XV.,"merry, and abide here drinking wine. Lo, the nights now are of length"
8328,BOOK XV.,"untold. Time is there to sleep, and time to listen and be glad; thou"
8329,BOOK XV.,needest not turn to bed before the hour; even too much sleep is
8330,BOOK XV.,"vexation of spirit. But for the rest, let him whose heart and mind bid"
8331,BOOK XV.,"him, go forth and slumber, and at the dawning of the day let him break"
8332,BOOK XV.,"his fast, and follow our master’s swine. But let us twain drink and"
8333,BOOK XV.,"feast within the steading, and each in his neighbour’s sorrows take"
8334,BOOK XV.,"delight, recalling them, for even the memory of griefs is a joy to a"
8335,BOOK XV.,man who hath been sore tried and wandered far. Wherefore I will tell
8336,BOOK XV.,thee that whereof thou askest and dost question me.
8337,BOOK XV.,
8338,BOOK XV.,"“There is a certain isle called Syria, if haply thou hast heard tell of"
8339,BOOK XV.,"it, over above Ortygia, and there are the turning-places of the sun. It"
8340,BOOK XV.,"is not very great in compass, though a goodly isle, rich in herds, rich"
8341,BOOK XV.,"in flocks, with plenty of corn and wine. Dearth never enters the land,"
8342,BOOK XV.,and no hateful sickness falls on wretched mortals. But when the tribes
8343,BOOK XV.,"of men grow old in that city, then comes Apollo of the silver bow, with"
8344,BOOK XV.,"Artemis, and slays them with the visitation of his gentle shafts. In"
8345,BOOK XV.,"that isle are two cities, and the whole land is divided between them,"
8346,BOOK XV.,"and my father was king over the twain, Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man"
8347,BOOK XV.,like to the Immortals.
8348,BOOK XV.,
8349,BOOK XV.,"“Thither came the Phoenicians, mariners renowned, greedy merchant men,"
8350,BOOK XV.,with countless gauds in a black ship. Now in my father’s house was a
8351,BOOK XV.,"Phoenician woman, tall and fair and skilled in bright handiwork; this"
8352,BOOK XV.,woman the Phoenicians with their sleights beguiled. First as she was
8353,BOOK XV.,"washing clothes, one of them lay with her in love by the hollow ship,"
8354,BOOK XV.,"for love beguiles the minds of womankind, even of the upright. Then he"
8355,BOOK XV.,"asked her who she was and whence she came, and straightway she showed"
8356,BOOK XV.,"him the lofty home of my father, saying:"
8357,BOOK XV.,
8358,BOOK XV.,"“‘From out of Sidon I avow that I come, land rich in bronze, and I am"
8359,BOOK XV.,"the daughter of Arybas, the deeply wealthy. But Taphians, who were"
8360,BOOK XV.,"sea-robbers, laid hands on me and snatched me away as I came in from"
8361,BOOK XV.,"the fields, and brought me hither and sold me into the house of my"
8362,BOOK XV.,"master, who paid for me a goodly price.’"
8363,BOOK XV.,
8364,BOOK XV.,"“Then the man who had lain with her privily, answered: ‘Say, wouldst"
8365,BOOK XV.,"thou now return home with us, that thou mayst look again on the lofty"
8366,BOOK XV.,house of thy father and mother and on their faces? For truly they yet
8367,BOOK XV.,"live, and have a name for wealth.’"
8368,BOOK XV.,
8369,BOOK XV.,"“Then the woman answered him and spake, saying: ‘Even this may well be,"
8370,BOOK XV.,if ye sailors will pledge me an oath to bring me home in safety.’
8371,BOOK XV.,
8372,BOOK XV.,"“So spake she, and they all swore thereto as she bade them. Now when"
8373,BOOK XV.,"they had sworn and done that oath, again the woman spake among them and"
8374,BOOK XV.,"answered, saying:"
8375,BOOK XV.,
8376,BOOK XV.,"“‘Hold your peace now, and let none of your fellows speak to me and"
8377,BOOK XV.,"greet me, if they meet me in the street, or even at the well, lest one"
8378,BOOK XV.,"go and tell it to the old man at home, and he suspect somewhat and bind"
8379,BOOK XV.,me in hard bonds and devise death for all of you. But keep ye the
8380,BOOK XV.,"matter in mind, and speed the purchase of your homeward freight. And"
8381,BOOK XV.,"when your ship is freighted with stores, let a message come quickly to"
8382,BOOK XV.,"me at the house; for I will likewise bring gold, all that comes under"
8383,BOOK XV.,my hand. Yea and there is another thing that I would gladly give for my
8384,BOOK XV.,"fare. I am nurse to the child of my lord in the halls, a most cunning"
8385,BOOK XV.,"little boy, that runs out and abroad with me. Him would I bring on"
8386,BOOK XV.,"board ship, and he should fetch you a great price, wheresoever ye take"
8387,BOOK XV.,him for sale among men of strange speech.’
8388,BOOK XV.,
8389,BOOK XV.,“Therewith she went her way to the fair halls. But they abode among us
8390,BOOK XV.,"a whole year, and got together much wealth in their hollow ship. And"
8391,BOOK XV.,"when their hollow ship was now laden to depart, they sent a messenger"
8392,BOOK XV.,to tell the tidings to the woman. There came a man versed in craft to
8393,BOOK XV.,"my father’s house, with a golden chain strung here and there with amber"
8394,BOOK XV.,beads. Now the maidens in the hall and my lady mother were handling the
8395,BOOK XV.,"chain and gazing on it, and offering him their price; but he had signed"
8396,BOOK XV.,"silently to the woman, and therewithal gat him away to the hollow ship."
8397,BOOK XV.,Then she took me by the hand and led me forth from the house. And at
8398,BOOK XV.,the vestibule of the house she found the cups and the tables of the
8399,BOOK XV.,"guests that had been feasting, who were in waiting on my father. They"
8400,BOOK XV.,had gone forth to the session and the place of parley of the people.
8401,BOOK XV.,"And she straightway hid three goblets in her bosom, and bare them away,"
8402,BOOK XV.,and I followed in my innocence. Then the sun sank and all the ways were
8403,BOOK XV.,"darkened and we went quickly and came to the good haven, where was the"
8404,BOOK XV.,swift ship of the Phoenicians. So they climbed on board and took us up
8405,BOOK XV.,"with them, and sailed over the wet ways, and Zeus sent us a favouring"
8406,BOOK XV.,wind. For six days we sailed by day and night continually; but when
8407,BOOK XV.,"Zeus, son of Cronos, added the seventh day thereto, then Artemis, the"
8408,BOOK XV.,"archer, smote the woman that she fell, as a sea-swallow falls, with a"
8409,BOOK XV.,plunge into the hold. And they cast her forth to be the prey of seals
8410,BOOK XV.,"and fishes, but I was left stricken at heart. And wind and water bare"
8411,BOOK XV.,"them and brought them to Ithaca, where Laertes bought me with his"
8412,BOOK XV.,possessions. And thus it chanced that mine eyes beheld this land.”
8413,BOOK XV.,
8414,BOOK XV.,"Then Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, answered him saying:"
8415,BOOK XV.,
8416,BOOK XV.,"“Eumaeus, verily thou hast stirred my heart within me with the tale of"
8417,BOOK XV.,"all these things, of all the sorrow of heart thou hast endured. Yet"
8418,BOOK XV.,"surely Zeus hath given thee good as well as evil, since after all these"
8419,BOOK XV.,"adventures thou hast come to the house of a kindly man, who is careful"
8420,BOOK XV.,to give thee meat and drink and right well thou livest. But I have come
8421,BOOK XV.,hither still wandering through the many towns of men.”
8422,BOOK XV.,
8423,BOOK XV.,Thus they spake one with the other. Then they laid them down to sleep
8424,BOOK XV.,"for no long while, but for a little space, for soon came the throned"
8425,BOOK XV.,Dawn. But on the shore the company of Telemachus were striking their
8426,BOOK XV.,"sails, and took down the mast quickly and rowed the ship on to"
8427,BOOK XV.,"anchorage. And they cast anchors and made fast the hawsers, and"
8428,BOOK XV.,"themselves too stept forth upon the strand of the sea, and made ready"
8429,BOOK XV.,"the midday meal, and mixed the dark wine. Now when they had put from"
8430,BOOK XV.,"them the desire of meat and drink, wise Telemachus first spake among"
8431,BOOK XV.,them:
8432,BOOK XV.,
8433,BOOK XV.,"“Do ye now drive the black ship to the city, while I will go to the"
8434,BOOK XV.,"fields and to the herdsmen, and at even I will return to the city, when"
8435,BOOK XV.,I have seen my lands. And in the morning I will set by you the wages of
8436,BOOK XV.,"the voyage, a good feast of flesh and of sweet wine.”"
8437,BOOK XV.,
8438,BOOK XV.,"Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “And whither shall I go, dear"
8439,BOOK XV.,"child? To what man’s house shall I betake me, of such as are lords in"
8440,BOOK XV.,rocky Ithaca? Shall I get me straight to thy mother and to thy home?”
8441,BOOK XV.,
8442,BOOK XV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “In other case I would bid"
8443,BOOK XV.,thee go even to our own house; for there is no lack of cheer for
8444,BOOK XV.,"strangers, but now would it be worse for thyself, forasmuch as I shall"
8445,BOOK XV.,be away nor would my mother see thee. For she comes not often in sight
8446,BOOK XV.,"of the wooers in the house, but abides apart from them in her upper"
8447,BOOK XV.,"chamber, and weaves at her web. Yet there is one whom I will tell thee"
8448,BOOK XV.,"of, to whom thou mayst go, Eurymachus the glorious son of wise Polybus,"
8449,BOOK XV.,"whom now the men of Ithaca look upon, even as if he were a god. For he"
8450,BOOK XV.,"is far the best man of them all, and is most eager to wed my mother and"
8451,BOOK XV.,"to have the sovereignty of Odysseus. Howbeit, Olympian Zeus, that"
8452,BOOK XV.,"dwells in the clear sky, knows hereof, whether or no he will fulfill"
8453,BOOK XV.,for them the evil day before their marriage.”
8454,BOOK XV.,
8455,BOOK XV.,"Now even as he spake, a bird flew out on the right, a hawk, the swift"
8456,BOOK XV.,"messenger of Apollo. In his talons he held a dove and plucked her, and"
8457,BOOK XV.,"shed the feathers down to the earth, midway between the ship and"
8458,BOOK XV.,Telemachus himself. Then Theoclymenus called him apart from his
8459,BOOK XV.,"fellows, and clasped his hand and spake and hailed him:"
8460,BOOK XV.,
8461,BOOK XV.,"“Telemachus, surely not without the god’s will hath the bird flown out"
8462,BOOK XV.,"on the right, for I knew when I saw him that he was a bird of omen."
8463,BOOK XV.,There is no other house more kingly than yours in the land of Ithaca;
8464,BOOK XV.,"nay, ye have ever the mastery.”"
8465,BOOK XV.,
8466,BOOK XV.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Ah, stranger, would that"
8467,BOOK XV.,this word may be accomplished! Soon shouldest thou be aware of kindness
8468,BOOK XV.,"and many a gift at my hands, so that whoso met with thee would call"
8469,BOOK XV.,thee blessed.”
8470,BOOK XV.,
8471,BOOK XV.,"Then he spake to Piraeus, his trusty companion: “Piraeus, son of"
8472,BOOK XV.,"Clytius, thou that at other seasons hearkenest to me above all my"
8473,BOOK XV.,"company who went with me to Pylos, even now, I pray, lead this stranger"
8474,BOOK XV.,"home with thee, and give heed to treat him lovingly and with worship in"
8475,BOOK XV.,thy house till I come.”
8476,BOOK XV.,
8477,BOOK XV.,"Then Piraeus, spearsman renowned, answered him saying: “Telemachus,"
8478,BOOK XV.,"why, even if thou shouldest tarry here long, yet will I entertain this"
8479,BOOK XV.,"man, and he shall have no lack of stranger’s cheer.”"
8480,BOOK XV.,
8481,BOOK XV.,"Therewith he went on board, and bade his men themselves to mount and"
8482,BOOK XV.,loose the hawsers. And quickly they embarked and sat upon the benches.
8483,BOOK XV.,"And Telemachus bound his goodly sandals beneath his feet, and seized a"
8484,BOOK XV.,"mighty spear, shod with sharp bronze, from the deck of the ship and his"
8485,BOOK XV.,"men loosed the hawsers. So they thrust off and sailed to the city, as"
8486,BOOK XV.,"Telemachus bade them, the dear son of divine Odysseus. But swiftly his"
8487,BOOK XV.,"feet bore him on his forward way, till he came to the court, where were"
8488,BOOK XV.,"his swine out of number; and among them the good swineherd slept, a man"
8489,BOOK XV.,loyal to his lords.
8490,BOOK XV.,
8491,BOOK XV.,
8492,BOOK XV.,
8493,BOOK XVI.,BOOK XVI.
8494,BOOK XVI.,
8495,BOOK XVI.,
8496,BOOK XVI.,Telemachus sends Eumaeus to the city to tell his mother of his return.
8497,BOOK XVI.,"And how, in the meantime, Odysseus discovers himself to his son."
8498,BOOK XVI.,
8499,BOOK XVI.,
8500,BOOK XVI.,"Now these twain, Odysseus and the goodly swineherd, within the hut had"
8501,BOOK XVI.,"kindled a fire, and were making ready breakfast at the dawn, and had"
8502,BOOK XVI.,sent forth the herdsmen with the droves of swine. And round Telemachus
8503,BOOK XVI.,"the hounds, that love to bark, fawned and barked not, as he drew nigh."
8504,BOOK XVI.,"And goodly Odysseus took note of the fawning of the dogs, and the noise"
8505,BOOK XVI.,of footsteps fell upon his ears. Then straight he spake to Eumaeus
8506,BOOK XVI.,winged words:
8507,BOOK XVI.,
8508,BOOK XVI.,"“Eumaeus, verily some friend or some other of thy familiars will soon"
8509,BOOK XVI.,"be here, for the dogs do not bark but fawn around, and I catch the"
8510,BOOK XVI.,sound of footsteps.”
8511,BOOK XVI.,
8512,BOOK XVI.,"While the word was yet on his lips, his own dear son stood at the"
8513,BOOK XVI.,"entering in of the gate. Then the swineherd sprang up in amazement, and"
8514,BOOK XVI.,out of his hands fell the vessels wherewith he was busied in mingling
8515,BOOK XVI.,the dark wine. And he came over against his master and kissed his head
8516,BOOK XVI.,"and both his beautiful eyes and both his hands, and he let a great tear"
8517,BOOK XVI.,fall. And even as a loving father welcomes his son that has come in the
8518,BOOK XVI.,"tenth year from a far country, his only son and well-beloved, for whose"
8519,BOOK XVI.,"sake he has had great sorrow and travail, even so did the goodly"
8520,BOOK XVI.,"swineherd fall upon the neck of godlike Telemachus, and kiss him all"
8521,BOOK XVI.,"over as one escaped from death, and he wept aloud and spake to him"
8522,BOOK XVI.,winged words:
8523,BOOK XVI.,
8524,BOOK XVI.,"“Thou art come, Telemachus, a sweet light in the dark; methought I"
8525,BOOK XVI.,"should see thee never again, after thou hadst gone in thy ship to"
8526,BOOK XVI.,"Pylos. Nay now enter, dear child, that my heart may be glad at the"
8527,BOOK XVI.,"sight of thee in mine house, who hast newly come from afar. For thou"
8528,BOOK XVI.,"dost not often visit the field and the herdsmen, but abidest in the"
8529,BOOK XVI.,"town; so it seems has thy good pleasure been, to look on the ruinous"
8530,BOOK XVI.,throng of the wooers.”
8531,BOOK XVI.,
8532,BOOK XVI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “So be it, father, as thou"
8533,BOOK XVI.,"sayest; and for thy sake am I come hither to see thee with mine eyes,"
8534,BOOK XVI.,and to hear from thy lips whether my mother yet abides in the halls or
8535,BOOK XVI.,"another has already wedded her, and the couch of Odysseus, perchance,"
8536,BOOK XVI.,lies in lack of bedding and deep in foul spider-webs.”
8537,BOOK XVI.,
8538,BOOK XVI.,"Then the swineherd, a master of men, answered him: “Yea verily, she"
8539,BOOK XVI.,"abides with patient spirit in thy halls, and wearily for her the nights"
8540,BOOK XVI.,"wane always and the days, in shedding of tears.”"
8541,BOOK XVI.,
8542,BOOK XVI.,So he spake and took from him the spear of bronze. Then Telemachus
8543,BOOK XVI.,"passed within and crossed the threshold of stone. As he came near, his"
8544,BOOK XVI.,"father Odysseus arose from his seat to give him place; but Telemachus,"
8545,BOOK XVI.,"on his part, stayed him and spake saying:"
8546,BOOK XVI.,
8547,BOOK XVI.,"“Be seated, stranger, and we will find a seat some other where in our"
8548,BOOK XVI.,"steading, and there is a man here to set it for us.”"
8549,BOOK XVI.,
8550,BOOK XVI.,"So he spake, and Odysseus went back and sat him down again. And the"
8551,BOOK XVI.,"swineherd strewed for Telemachus green brushwood below, and a fleece"
8552,BOOK XVI.,"thereupon, and there presently the dear son of Odysseus sat him down."
8553,BOOK XVI.,"Next the swineherd set by them platters of roast flesh, the fragments"
8554,BOOK XVI.,that were left from the meal of yesterday. And wheaten bread he briskly
8555,BOOK XVI.,"heaped up in baskets, and mixed the honey-sweet wine in a goblet of ivy"
8556,BOOK XVI.,"wood, and himself sat down over against divine Odysseus. So they"
8557,BOOK XVI.,stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set before them. Now
8558,BOOK XVI.,"when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink, Telemachus"
8559,BOOK XVI.,"spake to the goodly swineherd, saying:"
8560,BOOK XVI.,
8561,BOOK XVI.,"“Father, whence came this stranger to thee? How did sailors bring him"
8562,BOOK XVI.,"to Ithaca? and who did they avow them to be? For in no wise, I deem,"
8563,BOOK XVI.,did he come hither by land.”
8564,BOOK XVI.,
8565,BOOK XVI.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “Yea now, my son, I"
8566,BOOK XVI.,will tell thee all the truth. Of wide Crete he avows him to be by
8567,BOOK XVI.,"lineage, and he says that round many cities of mortals he has wandered"
8568,BOOK XVI.,at adventure; even so has some god spun for him the thread of fate. But
8569,BOOK XVI.,"now, as a runaway from a ship of the Thesprotians, has he come to my"
8570,BOOK XVI.,"steading, and I will give him to thee for thy man; do with him as thou"
8571,BOOK XVI.,wilt; he avows him for thy suppliant.”
8572,BOOK XVI.,
8573,BOOK XVI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Eumaeus, verily a bitter"
8574,BOOK XVI.,word is this that thou speakest. How indeed shall I receive this guest
8575,BOOK XVI.,"in my house? Myself I am young, and trust not yet to my strength of"
8576,BOOK XVI.,hands to defend me against the man who does violence without a cause.
8577,BOOK XVI.,"And my mother has divisions of heart, whether to abide here with me and"
8578,BOOK XVI.,"keep the house, respecting the bed of her lord and the voice of the"
8579,BOOK XVI.,"people, or straightway to go with whomsoever of the Achaeans that woo"
8580,BOOK XVI.,"her in the halls is the best man, and gives most bridal gifts. But"
8581,BOOK XVI.,"behold, as for this guest of thine, now that he has come to thy house,"
8582,BOOK XVI.,"I will clothe him in a mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment, and I will"
8583,BOOK XVI.,"give him a two-edged sword, and shoes for his feet, and send him on his"
8584,BOOK XVI.,"way, whithersoever his heart and his spirit bid him go. Or, if thou"
8585,BOOK XVI.,"wilt, hold him here in the steading and take care of him, and raiment I"
8586,BOOK XVI.,"will send hither, and all manner of food to eat, that he be not ruinous"
8587,BOOK XVI.,to thee and to thy fellows. But thither into the company of the wooers
8588,BOOK XVI.,"would I not suffer him to go, for they are exceeding full of infatuate"
8589,BOOK XVI.,"insolence, lest they mock at him, and that would be a sore grief to me."
8590,BOOK XVI.,"And hard it is for one man, how valiant soever, to achieve aught among"
8591,BOOK XVI.,"a multitude, for verily they are far the stronger.”"
8592,BOOK XVI.,
8593,BOOK XVI.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: “My friend, since it"
8594,BOOK XVI.,"is indeed my right to answer thee withal, of a truth my heart is rent"
8595,BOOK XVI.,"as I hear your words, such infatuate deeds ye say the wooers devise in"
8596,BOOK XVI.,"the halls, in despite of thee, a man so noble. Say, dost thou willingly"
8597,BOOK XVI.,"submit thee to oppression, or do the people through the township hate"
8598,BOOK XVI.,"thee, obedient to the voice of a god? Or hast thou cause to blame thy"
8599,BOOK XVI.,"brethren, in whose battle a man puts trust, even if a great feud arise?"
8600,BOOK XVI.,"Ah, would that I had the youth, as now I have the spirit, and were"
8601,BOOK XVI.,"either the son of noble Odysseus or Odysseus’ very self,[26]"
8602,BOOK XVI.,"straightway then might a stranger sever my head from off my neck, if I"
8603,BOOK XVI.,"went not to the halls of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and made myself the"
8604,BOOK XVI.,bane of every man among them! But if they should overcome me by
8605,BOOK XVI.,"numbers, being but one man against so many, far rather would I die"
8606,BOOK XVI.,"slain in mine own halls, than witness for ever these unseemly deeds,"
8607,BOOK XVI.,"strangers shamefully entreated, and men haling the handmaidens in foul"
8608,BOOK XVI.,"wise through the fair house, and wine drawn wastefully and the wooers"
8609,BOOK XVI.,"devouring food all recklessly without avail, at a work that knows no"
8610,BOOK XVI.,ending.”
8611,BOOK XVI.,
8612,BOOK XVI.,"[26] We omit line 101, which spoils the sense of the passage, and was"
8613,BOOK XVI.,rejected by antiquity.
8614,BOOK XVI.,
8615,BOOK XVI.,
8616,BOOK XVI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Yea now, stranger I will"
8617,BOOK XVI.,plainly tell thee all. There is no grudge and hatred borne my by the
8618,BOOK XVI.,"whole people, neither have I cause to blame my brethren, in whose"
8619,BOOK XVI.,"battle a man puts trust, even if a great feud arise. For thus, as thou"
8620,BOOK XVI.,"seest, Cronion has made us a house of but one heir. Arceisius got him"
8621,BOOK XVI.,"one only son Laertes, and one only son Odysseus was begotten of his"
8622,BOOK XVI.,"father, and Odysseus left me the only child of his getting in these"
8623,BOOK XVI.,"halls, and had no joy of me; wherefore now are foemen innumerable in"
8624,BOOK XVI.,"the house. For all the noblest that are princes in the islands, in"
8625,BOOK XVI.,"Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus, and as many as lord it in"
8626,BOOK XVI.,"rocky Ithaca, all these woo my mother and waste my house. But as for"
8627,BOOK XVI.,"her she neither refuseth the hated bridal, nor hath the heart to make"
8628,BOOK XVI.,and end; so they devour and minish my house; and ere long will they
8629,BOOK XVI.,make havoc likewise of myself. Howbeit these things surely lie on the
8630,BOOK XVI.,"knees of the gods. Nay, father, but do thou go with haste and tell the"
8631,BOOK XVI.,constant Penelope that she hath got me safe and that I am come up out
8632,BOOK XVI.,"of Pylos. As for me, I will tarry here, and do thou return hither when"
8633,BOOK XVI.,thou hast told the tidings to her alone; but of the other Achaeans let
8634,BOOK XVI.,"no man learn it, for there be many that devise mischief against me.”"
8635,BOOK XVI.,
8636,BOOK XVI.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “I mark, I heed, all"
8637,BOOK XVI.,"this thou speakest to one with understanding. But come, declare me this"
8638,BOOK XVI.,and tell it plainly; whether or no I shall go the same road with
8639,BOOK XVI.,"tidings to Laertes, that hapless man, who till lately, despite his"
8640,BOOK XVI.,"great sorrow for Odysseus’ sake, yet had oversight of the tillage, and"
8641,BOOK XVI.,"did eat and drink with the thralls in his house, as often as his heart"
8642,BOOK XVI.,"within him bade him. But now, from the day that thou wentest in thy"
8643,BOOK XVI.,"ship to Pylos, never to this hour, they say, hath he so much as eaten"
8644,BOOK XVI.,"and drunken, nor looked to the labours of the field, but with groaning"
8645,BOOK XVI.,"and lamentation he sits sorrowing, and the flesh wastes away about his"
8646,BOOK XVI.,bones.”
8647,BOOK XVI.,
8648,BOOK XVI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “All the more grievous it"
8649,BOOK XVI.,"is! yet will we let him be, though we sorrow thereat. For if men might"
8650,BOOK XVI.,"in any wise have all their will, we should before ought else choose the"
8651,BOOK XVI.,day of my father’s returning. But do thou when thou hast told the
8652,BOOK XVI.,"tidings come straight back, and go not wandering through the fields"
8653,BOOK XVI.,after Laertes. But speak to my mother that with all speed she send
8654,BOOK XVI.,"forth the house-dame her handmaid, secretly, for she might bear tidings"
8655,BOOK XVI.,to the old man.”
8656,BOOK XVI.,
8657,BOOK XVI.,"With that word he roused the swineherd, who took his sandals in his"
8658,BOOK XVI.,hands and bound them beneath his feet and departed for the city. Now
8659,BOOK XVI.,"Athene noted Eumaeus the swineherd pass from the steading, and she drew"
8660,BOOK XVI.,"nigh in the semblance of a woman fair and tall, and skilled in splendid"
8661,BOOK XVI.,handiwork. And she stood in presence manifest to Odysseus over against
8662,BOOK XVI.,the doorway of the hut; but it was so that Telemachus saw her not
8663,BOOK XVI.,before him and marked her not; for the gods in no wise appear visibly
8664,BOOK XVI.,"to all. But Odysseus was ware of her and the dogs likewise, which"
8665,BOOK XVI.,"barked not, but with a low whine shrank cowering to the far side of the"
8666,BOOK XVI.,"steading. Then she nodded at him with bent brows, and goodly Odysseus"
8667,BOOK XVI.,"perceived it, and came forth from the room, past the great wall of the"
8668,BOOK XVI.,"yard, and stood before her, and Athene spake to him, saying:"
8669,BOOK XVI.,
8670,BOOK XVI.,"“Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, now is"
8671,BOOK XVI.,"the hour to reveal thy word to thy son, and hide it not, that ye twain"
8672,BOOK XVI.,"having framed death and doom for the wooers, may fare to the famous"
8673,BOOK XVI.,"town. Nor will I, even I, be long away from you, being right eager for"
8674,BOOK XVI.,battle.”
8675,BOOK XVI.,
8676,BOOK XVI.,Therewith Athene touched him with her golden wand. First she cast about
8677,BOOK XVI.,"his breast a fresh linen robe and a doublet, and she increased his bulk"
8678,BOOK XVI.,"and bloom. Dark his colour grew again, and his cheeks filled out, and"
8679,BOOK XVI.,the black beard spread thick around his chin.
8680,BOOK XVI.,
8681,BOOK XVI.,"Now she, when she had so wrought, withdrew again, but Odysseus went"
8682,BOOK XVI.,"into the hut, and his dear son marvelled at him and looked away for"
8683,BOOK XVI.,"very fear lest it should be a god, and he uttered his voice and spake"
8684,BOOK XVI.,to him winged words:
8685,BOOK XVI.,
8686,BOOK XVI.,"“Even now, stranger, thou art other in my sight than that thou wert a"
8687,BOOK XVI.,"moment since, and other garments thou hast, and the colour of thy skin"
8688,BOOK XVI.,is no longer the same. Surely thou art a god of those that keep the
8689,BOOK XVI.,"wide heaven. Nay then, be gracious, that we may offer to thee"
8690,BOOK XVI.,"well-pleasing sacrifices and golden gifts, beautifully wrought; and"
8691,BOOK XVI.,spare us I pray thee.”
8692,BOOK XVI.,
8693,BOOK XVI.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying: “Behold, no"
8694,BOOK XVI.,"god am I; why likenest thou me to the immortals? nay, thy father am I,"
8695,BOOK XVI.,"for whose sake thou sufferest many pains and groanest sore, and"
8696,BOOK XVI.,"submittest thee to the despite of men,”"
8697,BOOK XVI.,
8698,BOOK XVI.,"At the word he kissed his son, and from his cheeks let a tear fall to"
8699,BOOK XVI.,"earth: before, he had stayed the tears continually. But Telemachus (for"
8700,BOOK XVI.,as yet he believed not that it was his father) answered in turn and
8701,BOOK XVI.,"spake, saying:"
8702,BOOK XVI.,
8703,BOOK XVI.,"“Thou art not Odysseus my father, but some god beguiles me, that I may"
8704,BOOK XVI.,groan for more exceeding sorrow. For it cannot be that a mortal man
8705,BOOK XVI.,"should contrive this by the aid of his own wit, unless a god were"
8706,BOOK XVI.,"himself to visit him, and lightly of his own will to make him young or"
8707,BOOK XVI.,"old. For truly, but a moment gone, thou wert old and foully clad, but"
8708,BOOK XVI.,now thou art like the gods who keep the wide heaven.”
8709,BOOK XVI.,
8710,BOOK XVI.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Telemachus, it"
8711,BOOK XVI.,"fits thee not to marvel overmuch that thy father is come home, or to be"
8712,BOOK XVI.,amazed. Nay for thou shalt find no other Odysseus come hither any more;
8713,BOOK XVI.,"but lo, I, all as I am, after sufferings and much wandering have come"
8714,BOOK XVI.,"in the twentieth year to mine own country. Behold, this is the work of"
8715,BOOK XVI.,"Athene, driver of the spoil, who makes me such manner of man as she"
8716,BOOK XVI.,"will,—for with her it is possible,— now like a beggar, and now again"
8717,BOOK XVI.,"like a young man, and one clad about in rich raiment. Easy it is for"
8718,BOOK XVI.,the gods who keep the wide heaven to glorify or to abase a mortal man.”
8719,BOOK XVI.,
8720,BOOK XVI.,"With this word then he sat down again; but Telemachus, flinging himself"
8721,BOOK XVI.,"upon his noble father’s neck, mourned and shed tears, and in both their"
8722,BOOK XVI.,"hearts arose the desire of lamentation. And they wailed aloud, more"
8723,BOOK XVI.,"ceaselessly than birds, sea-eagles or vultures of crooked claws, whose"
8724,BOOK XVI.,"younglings the country folk have taken from the nest, ere yet they are"
8725,BOOK XVI.,fledged. Even so pitifully fell the tears beneath their brows. And now
8726,BOOK XVI.,"would the sunlight have gone down upon their sorrowing, had not"
8727,BOOK XVI.,Telemachus spoken to his father suddenly:
8728,BOOK XVI.,
8729,BOOK XVI.,"“And in what manner of ship, father dear, did sailors at length bring"
8730,BOOK XVI.,thee hither to Ithaca? and who did they avow them to be? For in no
8731,BOOK XVI.,"wise, I deem, didst thou come hither by land.”"
8732,BOOK XVI.,
8733,BOOK XVI.,"And the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: “Yea now, my child, I"
8734,BOOK XVI.,"will tell thee all the truth. The Phaeacians brought me hither,"
8735,BOOK XVI.,"mariners renowned, who speed other men too upon their way, whosoever"
8736,BOOK XVI.,comes to them. Asleep in the swift ship they bore me over the seas and
8737,BOOK XVI.,"set me down in Ithaca, and gave me splendid gifts, bronze and gold in"
8738,BOOK XVI.,plenty and woven raiment. And these treasures are lying by the gods’
8739,BOOK XVI.,grace in the caves. But now I am come hither by the promptings of
8740,BOOK XVI.,"Athene, that we may take counsel for the slaughter of the foemen. But"
8741,BOOK XVI.,"come, tell me all the tale of the wooers and their number, that I may"
8742,BOOK XVI.,"know how many and what men they be, and that so I may commune with my"
8743,BOOK XVI.,"good heart and advise me, whether we twain shall be able alone to make"
8744,BOOK XVI.,"head against them without aid, or whether we should even seek succour"
8745,BOOK XVI.,of others.”
8746,BOOK XVI.,
8747,BOOK XVI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Verily, father, I have ever"
8748,BOOK XVI.,"heard of thy great fame, for a warrior hardy of thy hands, and sage in"
8749,BOOK XVI.,counsel. But this is a hard saying of thine: awe comes over me; for it
8750,BOOK XVI.,may not be that two men should do battle with many men and stalwart.
8751,BOOK XVI.,"For of the wooers there are not barely ten nor twice ten only, but many"
8752,BOOK XVI.,a decad more: and straight shalt thou learn the tale of them ere we
8753,BOOK XVI.,"part. From Dulichium there be two and fifty chosen lords, and six"
8754,BOOK XVI.,serving men go with them; and out of Same four and twenty men; and from
8755,BOOK XVI.,Zacynthus there are twenty lords of the Achaeans; and from Ithaca
8756,BOOK XVI.,"itself full twelve men of the best, and with them Medon the henchman,"
8757,BOOK XVI.,"and the divine minstrel, and two squires skilled in carving viands. If"
8758,BOOK XVI.,"we shall encounter all these within the halls, see thou to it, lest"
8759,BOOK XVI.,bitter and baneful for us be the vengeance thou takest on their
8760,BOOK XVI.,"violence at thy coming. But do thou, if thou canst think of some"
8761,BOOK XVI.,"champion, advise thee of any that may help us with all his heart.”"
8762,BOOK XVI.,
8763,BOOK XVI.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying: “Yea now, I"
8764,BOOK XVI.,"will tell thee, and do thou mark and listen to me, and consider whether"
8765,BOOK XVI.,"Athene with Father Zeus will suffice for us twain, or whether I shall"
8766,BOOK XVI.,cast about for some other champion.”
8767,BOOK XVI.,
8768,BOOK XVI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Valiant helpers, in sooth,"
8769,BOOK XVI.,"are these two thou namest, whose seat is aloft in the clouds, and they"
8770,BOOK XVI.,rule among all men and among the deathless gods!”
8771,BOOK XVI.,
8772,BOOK XVI.,Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: “Yet will the twain
8773,BOOK XVI.,"not long keep aloof from the strong tumult of war, when between the"
8774,BOOK XVI.,wooers and us in my halls is held the trial of the might of Ares. But
8775,BOOK XVI.,"as now, do thou go homeward at the breaking of the day, and consort"
8776,BOOK XVI.,"with the proud wooers. As for me, the swineherd will lead me to the"
8777,BOOK XVI.,"town later in the day, in the likeness of a beggar, a wretched man and"
8778,BOOK XVI.,"an old. And if they shall evil entreat me in the house, let thy heart"
8779,BOOK XVI.,"harden itself to endure while I am shamefully handled, yea even if they"
8780,BOOK XVI.,"drag me by the feet through the house to the doors, or cast at me and"
8781,BOOK XVI.,smite me: still do thou bear the sight. Howbeit thou shalt surely bid
8782,BOOK XVI.,"them cease from their folly, exhorting them with smooth words; yet no"
8783,BOOK XVI.,"whit will they hearken, nay for the day of their doom is at hand. Yet"
8784,BOOK XVI.,"another thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart."
8785,BOOK XVI.,"When Athene, of deep counsel, shall put it into my heart, I will nod to"
8786,BOOK XVI.,"thee with my head and do thou note it, and carry away all thy weapons"
8787,BOOK XVI.,"of war that lie in the halls, and lay them down every one in the secret"
8788,BOOK XVI.,place of the lofty chamber. And when the wooers miss them and ask thee
8789,BOOK XVI.,"concerning them, thou shalt beguile them with soft words, saying:"
8790,BOOK XVI.,
8791,BOOK XVI.,"“‘Out of the smoke I laid them by, since they were no longer like those"
8792,BOOK XVI.,"that Odysseus left behind him of old when he went to Troy, but they are"
8793,BOOK XVI.,wholly marred: so mightily hath passed upon them the vapour of fire.
8794,BOOK XVI.,"Moreover Cronion hath put into my heart this other and greater care,"
8795,BOOK XVI.,"that perchance, when ye are heated with wine, ye set a quarrel between"
8796,BOOK XVI.,you and wound one the other and thereby shame the feast and the wooing;
8797,BOOK XVI.,for iron of itself draws a man thereto.’ But for us twain alone leave
8798,BOOK XVI.,"two swords and two spears and two shields of oxhide to grasp, that we"
8799,BOOK XVI.,may rush upon the arms and seize them; and then shall Pallas Athene and
8800,BOOK XVI.,Zeus the counsellor enchant the wooers to their ruin. Yet another thing
8801,BOOK XVI.,"will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart. If in very truth"
8802,BOOK XVI.,"thou art my son and of our blood, then let no man hear that Odysseus is"
8803,BOOK XVI.,"come home; neither let Laertes know it, nor the swineherd nor any of"
8804,BOOK XVI.,"the household nor Penelope herself, but let me and thee alone discover"
8805,BOOK XVI.,"the intent of the women. Yea, and we would moreover make trial of"
8806,BOOK XVI.,"certain of the men among the thralls, and learn who[27] of them chances"
8807,BOOK XVI.,"to honour us and to fear us heartily, and who regards us not at all and"
8808,BOOK XVI.,"holds even thee in no esteem, so noble a man as thou art.”"
8809,BOOK XVI.,
8810,BOOK XVI.,[27] Reading ὅ πού τις.
8811,BOOK XVI.,
8812,BOOK XVI.,
8813,BOOK XVI.,"Then his renowned son answered him, and said: “O my father, of a truth"
8814,BOOK XVI.,"thou shalt learn, methinks, even hereafter what spirit I am of, for no"
8815,BOOK XVI.,whit doth folly possess me. But I deem not that this device of thine
8816,BOOK XVI.,"will be gainful to us twain, so I bid thee to give heed. For thou shalt"
8817,BOOK XVI.,"be long time on thy road to little purpose, making trial of each man,"
8818,BOOK XVI.,while thou visitest the farm lands; but at ease in thy halls the wooers
8819,BOOK XVI.,"devour thy goods with insolence, and now there is no sparing. Howbeit I"
8820,BOOK XVI.,"would have thee take knowledge of the women, who they be that dishonour"
8821,BOOK XVI.,"thee, and who are guiltless. But of the men I would not that we should"
8822,BOOK XVI.,"make trial in the steadings, but that we should see to this task"
8823,BOOK XVI.,"afterwards, if indeed thou knowest some sign from Zeus, lord of the"
8824,BOOK XVI.,aegis.”
8825,BOOK XVI.,
8826,BOOK XVI.,Thus they spake one to the other. And now the well-builded ship was
8827,BOOK XVI.,"being brought to land at Ithaca, the ship that bare Telemachus from"
8828,BOOK XVI.,Pylos with all his company. When they were now come within the deep
8829,BOOK XVI.,"harbour, the men drew up the black ship on the shore, while squires,"
8830,BOOK XVI.,"haughty of heart, bare away their weapons, and straightway carried the"
8831,BOOK XVI.,glorious gifts to the house of Clytius. Anon they sent forward a herald
8832,BOOK XVI.,"to the house of Odysseus to bear the tidings to prudent Penelope,"
8833,BOOK XVI.,"namely, how Telemachus was in the field, and had bidden the ship sail"
8834,BOOK XVI.,"to the city, lest the noble queen should be afraid, and let the round"
8835,BOOK XVI.,"tears fall. So these two met, the herald and the goodly swineherd, come"
8836,BOOK XVI.,on the same errand to tell all to the lady. Now when they were got to
8837,BOOK XVI.,"the house of the divine king, the herald spake out among all the"
8838,BOOK XVI.,handmaids saying:
8839,BOOK XVI.,
8840,BOOK XVI.,"“Verily, O queen, thy son hath come out of Pylos.”"
8841,BOOK XVI.,
8842,BOOK XVI.,"But the swineherd went up to Penelope, and told her all that her dear"
8843,BOOK XVI.,"son had bidden him say. So, when he had declared all that had been"
8844,BOOK XVI.,"enjoined him, he went on his way to the swine and left the enclosure"
8845,BOOK XVI.,and the hall.
8846,BOOK XVI.,
8847,BOOK XVI.,"Now the wooers were troubled and downcast in spirit, and forth they"
8848,BOOK XVI.,"went from the hall past the great wall of the court, and there in front"
8849,BOOK XVI.,of the gates they held their session. And Eurymachus son of Polybus
8850,BOOK XVI.,first spake among them saying:
8851,BOOK XVI.,
8852,BOOK XVI.,"“Verily, friends, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished with a high"
8853,BOOK XVI.,"hand, even this journey, and we said that he should never bring it to"
8854,BOOK XVI.,"pass. But come, launch we a black ship, the best there is, and let us"
8855,BOOK XVI.,"get together oarsmen of the sea, who shall straightway bear word to our"
8856,BOOK XVI.,friends to return home with speed.”
8857,BOOK XVI.,
8858,BOOK XVI.,"The word was yet on his lips, when Amphinomus turned in his place and"
8859,BOOK XVI.,"saw the ship within the deep harbour, and the men lowering the sails"
8860,BOOK XVI.,and with the oars in their hands. Then sweetly he laughed out and spake
8861,BOOK XVI.,among his fellows:
8862,BOOK XVI.,
8863,BOOK XVI.,"“Nay, let us now send no message any more, for lo, they are come home."
8864,BOOK XVI.,Either some god has told them all or they themselves have seen the ship
8865,BOOK XVI.,"of Telemachus go by, and have not been able to catch her.”"
8866,BOOK XVI.,
8867,BOOK XVI.,"Thus he spake, and they arose and went to the sea-banks. Swiftly the"
8868,BOOK XVI.,"men drew up the black ship on the shore, and squires, haughty of heart,"
8869,BOOK XVI.,bare away their weapons. And the wooers all together went to the
8870,BOOK XVI.,"assembly-place, and suffered none other to sit with them, either of the"
8871,BOOK XVI.,"young men or of the elders. Then Antinous spake among them, the son of"
8872,BOOK XVI.,Eupeithes:
8873,BOOK XVI.,
8874,BOOK XVI.,"“Lo now, how the gods have delivered this man from his evil case! All"
8875,BOOK XVI.,"day long did scouts sit along the windy headlands, ever in quick"
8876,BOOK XVI.,"succession, and at the going down of the sun we never rested for a"
8877,BOOK XVI.,"night upon the shore, but sailing with our swift ship on the high seas"
8878,BOOK XVI.,"we awaited the bright Dawn, as we lay in wait for Telemachus, that we"
8879,BOOK XVI.,might take and slay the man himself; but meanwhile some god has brought
8880,BOOK XVI.,"him home. But even here let us devise an evil end for him, even for"
8881,BOOK XVI.,"Telemachus, and let him not escape out of our hands, for methinks that"
8882,BOOK XVI.,while he lives we shall never achieve this task of ours. For he himself
8883,BOOK XVI.,"has understanding in counsel and wisdom, and the people no longer show"
8884,BOOK XVI.,"us favour in all things. Nay come, before he assembles all the Achaeans"
8885,BOOK XVI.,"to the gathering; for methinks that he will in nowise be slack, but"
8886,BOOK XVI.,"will be exceeding wroth, and will stand up and speak out among them"
8887,BOOK XVI.,"all, and tell how we plotted against him sheer destruction but did not"
8888,BOOK XVI.,"overtake him. Then will they not approve us, when they hear these evil"
8889,BOOK XVI.,"deeds. Beware then lest they do us a harm, and drive us forth from our"
8890,BOOK XVI.,"country, and we come to the land of strangers. Nay, but let us be"
8891,BOOK XVI.,"beforehand and take him in the field far from the city, or by the way;"
8892,BOOK XVI.,"and let us ourselves keep his livelihood and his possessions, making"
8893,BOOK XVI.,"fair division among us, but the house we would give to his mother to"
8894,BOOK XVI.,"keep and to whomsoever marries her. But if this saying likes you not,"
8895,BOOK XVI.,but ye chose rather that he should live and keep the heritage of his
8896,BOOK XVI.,"father, no longer then let us gather here and eat all his store of"
8897,BOOK XVI.,"pleasant substance, but let each one from his own hall woo her with his"
8898,BOOK XVI.,bridal gifts and seek to win her; so should she wed the man that gives
8899,BOOK XVI.,the most and comes as the chosen of fate.”
8900,BOOK XVI.,
8901,BOOK XVI.,"So he spake, and they all held their peace. Then Amphinomus made"
8902,BOOK XVI.,harangue and spake out among them; he was the famous son of Nisus the
8903,BOOK XVI.,"prince, the son of Aretias, and he led the wooers that came from out"
8904,BOOK XVI.,"Dulichium, a land rich in wheat and in grass, and more than all the"
8905,BOOK XVI.,"rest his words were pleasing to Penelope, for he was of an"
8906,BOOK XVI.,"understanding mind. And now of his good will he made harangue, and"
8907,BOOK XVI.,spake among them:
8908,BOOK XVI.,
8909,BOOK XVI.,"“Friends, I for one would not choose to kill Telemachus; it is a"
8910,BOOK XVI.,"fearful thing to slay one of the stock of kings! Nay, first let us seek"
8911,BOOK XVI.,"to the counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of great Zeus approve,"
8912,BOOK XVI.,myself I will slay him and bid all the rest to aid. But if the gods are
8913,BOOK XVI.,"disposed to avert it, I bid you to refrain.”"
8914,BOOK XVI.,
8915,BOOK XVI.,"So spake Amphinomus, and his saying pleased them well. Then straightway"
8916,BOOK XVI.,"they arose and went to the house of Odysseus, and entering in sat down"
8917,BOOK XVI.,on the polished seats.
8918,BOOK XVI.,
8919,BOOK XVI.,"Then the wise Penelope had a new thought, namely, to show herself to"
8920,BOOK XVI.,"the wooers, so despiteful in their insolence; for she had heard of the"
8921,BOOK XVI.,"death of her son that was to be in the halls, seeing that Medon the"
8922,BOOK XVI.,henchman had told her of it; who heard their counsels. So she went on
8923,BOOK XVI.,"her way to the hall, with the women her handmaids. Now when that fair"
8924,BOOK XVI.,"lady had come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the"
8925,BOOK XVI.,"well-builded roof, holding up her glistening tire before her face, and"
8926,BOOK XVI.,rebuked Antinous and spake and hailed him:
8927,BOOK XVI.,
8928,BOOK XVI.,"“Antinous, full of all insolence, deviser of mischief! and yet they say"
8929,BOOK XVI.,that in the land of Ithaca thou art chiefest among thy peers in counsel
8930,BOOK XVI.,"and in speech. Nay, no such man dost thou show thyself. Fool! why"
8931,BOOK XVI.,"indeed dost thou contrive death and doom for Telemachus, and hast no"
8932,BOOK XVI.,regard unto suppliants who have Zeus to witness? Nay but it is an
8933,BOOK XVI.,impious thing to contrive evil one against another. What! knowest thou
8934,BOOK XVI.,not of the day when thy father fled to this house in fear of the
8935,BOOK XVI.,"people, for verily they were exceeding wroth against him, because he"
8936,BOOK XVI.,"had followed with Taphian sea robbers and harried the Thesprotians, who"
8937,BOOK XVI.,were at peace with us. So they wished to destroy thy father and wrest
8938,BOOK XVI.,"from him his dear life, and utterly to devour all his great and"
8939,BOOK XVI.,"abundant livelihood; but Odysseus stayed and withheld them, for all"
8940,BOOK XVI.,"their desire. His house thou now consumest without atonement, and his"
8941,BOOK XVI.,"wife thou wooest, and wouldst slay his son, and dost greatly grieve me."
8942,BOOK XVI.,"But I bid thee cease, and command the others to do likewise.”"
8943,BOOK XVI.,
8944,BOOK XVI.,"Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her saying: “Daughter of"
8945,BOOK XVI.,"Icarius, wise Penelope, take courage, and let not thy heart be careful"
8946,BOOK XVI.,"for these things. The man is not, nor shall be, nor ever shall be born,"
8947,BOOK XVI.,"that shall stretch forth his hands against Telemachus, thy son, while I"
8948,BOOK XVI.,live and am on earth and see the light. For thus will I declare to
8949,BOOK XVI.,"thee, and it shall surely come to pass. Right quickly shall the black"
8950,BOOK XVI.,"blood of such an one flow about our spear; for Odysseus, waster of"
8951,BOOK XVI.,"cities, of a truth did many a time set me too upon his knees, and gave"
8952,BOOK XVI.,"me roasted flesh into my hand, and held the red wine to my lips."
8953,BOOK XVI.,"Wherefore Telemachus is far the dearest of all men to me, and I bid him"
8954,BOOK XVI.,"have no fear of death, not from the wooers’ hands; but from the gods"
8955,BOOK XVI.,none may avoid it.”
8956,BOOK XVI.,
8957,BOOK XVI.,"Thus he spake comforting her, but was himself the while framing death"
8958,BOOK XVI.,for her son.
8959,BOOK XVI.,
8960,BOOK XVI.,"Now she ascended to her shining upper chamber, and then was bewailing"
8961,BOOK XVI.,"Odysseus, her dear lord, till grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon"
8962,BOOK XVI.,her eyelids.
8963,BOOK XVI.,
8964,BOOK XVI.,And in the evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his
8965,BOOK XVI.,"son, and they made ready and served the supper, when they had"
8966,BOOK XVI.,"sacrificed a swine of a year old. Then Athene drew near Odysseus, son"
8967,BOOK XVI.,"of Laertes, and smote him with her wand, and made him into an old man"
8968,BOOK XVI.,"again. In sorry raiment she clad him about his body, lest the swineherd"
8969,BOOK XVI.,"should look on him and know him, and depart to tell the constant"
8970,BOOK XVI.,"Penelope, and not keep the matter in his heart."
8971,BOOK XVI.,
8972,BOOK XVI.,"Then Telemachus spake first to the swineherd, saying: “Thou hast come,"
8973,BOOK XVI.,goodly Eumaeus. What news is there in the town? Are the lordly wooers
8974,BOOK XVI.,"now come in from their ambush, or do they still watch for me as before"
8975,BOOK XVI.,on my homeward way?”
8976,BOOK XVI.,
8977,BOOK XVI.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “I had no mind to go"
8978,BOOK XVI.,down the city asking and inquiring hereof; my heart bade me get me home
8979,BOOK XVI.,"again, as quick as might be, when once I had told the tidings. And the"
8980,BOOK XVI.,"swift messenger from thy company joined himself unto me, the henchman,"
8981,BOOK XVI.,"who was the first to tell the news to thy mother. Yet this, too, I"
8982,BOOK XVI.,"know, if thou wouldest hear; for I beheld it with mine eyes. Already"
8983,BOOK XVI.,"had I come in my faring above the city, where is the hill Hermaean,"
8984,BOOK XVI.,"when I marked a swift ship entering our haven, and many men there were"
8985,BOOK XVI.,"in her, and she was laden with shields and two-headed spears, and"
8986,BOOK XVI.,"methought they were the wooers, but I know not at all.”"
8987,BOOK XVI.,
8988,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and the mighty prince Telemachus smiled, and glanced at"
8989,BOOK XVI.,"his father, while he shunned the eye of the swineherd."
8990,BOOK XVI.,
8991,BOOK XVI.,"Now when they had ceased from the work and got supper ready, they fell"
8992,BOOK XVI.,"to feasting, and their hearts lacked not ought of the equal banquet."
8993,BOOK XVI.,"But when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink, they"
8994,BOOK XVI.,"bethought them of rest, and took the boon of sleep."

9000,BOOK XVII.,
9001,BOOK XVII.,Telemachus relates to his mother what he had heard at Pylos and Sparta.
9002,BOOK XVII.,
9003,BOOK XVII.,
9004,BOOK XVII.,"So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then Telemachus,"
9005,BOOK XVII.,"the dear son of divine Odysseus, bound beneath his feet his goodly"
9006,BOOK XVII.,"sandals, and took up his mighty spear that fitted his grasp, to make"
9007,BOOK XVII.,"for the city; and he spake to his swineherd, saying:"
9008,BOOK XVII.,
9009,BOOK XVII.,"“Verily, father, I am bound for the city, that my mother may see me,"
9010,BOOK XVII.,for methinks that she will not cease from grievous wailing and tearful
9011,BOOK XVII.,"lament, until she beholds my very face. But this command I give thee:"
9012,BOOK XVII.,"Lead this stranger, the hapless one, to the city, that there he may beg"
9013,BOOK XVII.,"his meat, and whoso chooses will give him a morsel of bread and a cup"
9014,BOOK XVII.,"of water. As for myself, I can in no wise suffer every guest who comes"
9015,BOOK XVII.,"to me, so afflicted am I in spirit. But if the stranger be sore angered"
9016,BOOK XVII.,"hereat, the more grievous will it be for himself; howbeit I for one"
9017,BOOK XVII.,love to speak the truth.”
9018,BOOK XVII.,
9019,BOOK XVII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “I too, my friend,"
9020,BOOK XVII.,have no great liking to be left behind here. It is better that a beggar
9021,BOOK XVII.,"should beg his meat in the town than in the fields, and whoso chooses"
9022,BOOK XVII.,"will give it me. For I am not now of an age to abide at the steading,"
9023,BOOK XVII.,"and to obey in all things the word of the master. Nay go, and this man"
9024,BOOK XVII.,"that thou biddest will lead me, so soon as I shall be warmed with the"
9025,BOOK XVII.,"fire, and the sun waxes hot. For woefully poor are these garments of"
9026,BOOK XVII.,"mine, and I fear lest the hoar frost of the dawn overcome me; moreover"
9027,BOOK XVII.,ye say the city is far away.”
9028,BOOK XVII.,
9029,BOOK XVII.,"So he spake, and Telemachus passed out through the steading, stepping"
9030,BOOK XVII.,"forth at a quick pace, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers."
9031,BOOK XVII.,"Now when he was come to the fair-lying house, he set his spear against"
9032,BOOK XVII.,"the tall pillar and leaned it there, and himself went in and crossed"
9033,BOOK XVII.,the threshold of stone.
9034,BOOK XVII.,
9035,BOOK XVII.,"And the nurse Eurycleia saw him far before the rest, as she was"
9036,BOOK XVII.,"strewing skin coverlets upon the carven chairs, and straightway she"
9037,BOOK XVII.,"drew near him, weeping, and all the other maidens of Odysseus, of the"
9038,BOOK XVII.,"hardy heart, were gathered about him, and kissed him lovingly on the"
9039,BOOK XVII.,"head and shoulders. Now wise Penelope came forth from her chamber, like"
9040,BOOK XVII.,"Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and cast her arms about her dear son, and"
9041,BOOK XVII.,"fell a weeping, and kissed his face and both his beautiful eyes, and"
9042,BOOK XVII.,"wept aloud, and spake to him winged words:"
9043,BOOK XVII.,
9044,BOOK XVII.,"“Thou art come, Telemachus, a sweet light in the dark; methought I"
9045,BOOK XVII.,"should see thee never again, after thou hadst gone in thy ship to"
9046,BOOK XVII.,"Pylos, secretly and without my will, to seek tidings of thy dear"
9047,BOOK XVII.,"father. Come now, tell me, what sight thou didst get of him?”"
9048,BOOK XVII.,
9049,BOOK XVII.,"And wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “Mother mine, wake not"
9050,BOOK XVII.,"wailing in my soul, nor stir the heart within the breast of me, that"
9051,BOOK XVII.,"have but now fled from utter death. Nay, but wash thee in water, and"
9052,BOOK XVII.,"take to thee fresh raiment, and go aloft to thine upper chamber with"
9053,BOOK XVII.,"the women thy handmaids, and vow to all the gods an acceptable"
9054,BOOK XVII.,"sacrifice of hecatombs, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital"
9055,BOOK XVII.,be made. But I will go to the assembly-place to bid a stranger to our
9056,BOOK XVII.,"house, one that accompanied me as I came hither from Pylos. I sent him"
9057,BOOK XVII.,"forward with my godlike company, and commanded Piraeus to lead him"
9058,BOOK XVII.,"home, and to take heed to treat him lovingly and with worship till I"
9059,BOOK XVII.,should come.”
9060,BOOK XVII.,
9061,BOOK XVII.,"Thus he spake, and wingless her speech remained. And she washed her in"
9062,BOOK XVII.,"water, and took to her fresh raiment, and vowed to all the gods an"
9063,BOOK XVII.,"acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs, if haply Zeus might grant that deeds"
9064,BOOK XVII.,of requital should be made.
9065,BOOK XVII.,
9066,BOOK XVII.,Now Telemachus went out through the hall with the spear in his hand:
9067,BOOK XVII.,and two swift hounds bare him company. And Athene shed on him a
9068,BOOK XVII.,"wondrous grace, and all the people marvelled at him as he came. And the"
9069,BOOK XVII.,"lordly wooers gathered about him with fair words on their lips, but"
9070,BOOK XVII.,brooding evil in the deep of their heart. Then he avoided the great
9071,BOOK XVII.,"press of the wooers, but where Mentor sat, and Antiphus, and"
9072,BOOK XVII.,"Halitherses, who were friends of his house from of old, there he went"
9073,BOOK XVII.,"and sat down; and they asked him of all his adventures. Then Piraeus,"
9074,BOOK XVII.,"the famed spearsman, drew nigh, leading the stranger to the"
9075,BOOK XVII.,assembly-place by the way of the town; and Telemachus kept not aloof
9076,BOOK XVII.,"from him long, but went up to him."
9077,BOOK XVII.,
9078,BOOK XVII.,"Then Piraeus first spake to him, saying: “Bestir the women straightway"
9079,BOOK XVII.,"to go to my house, that I may send thee the gifts that Menelaus gave"
9080,BOOK XVII.,thee.”
9081,BOOK XVII.,
9082,BOOK XVII.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Piraeus, we know not how"
9083,BOOK XVII.,these matters will fall out. If the lordly wooers shall slay me by
9084,BOOK XVII.,"guile in the halls, and divide among them the heritage of my father,"
9085,BOOK XVII.,"then I should wish thee to keep and enjoy the gifts thyself, rather"
9086,BOOK XVII.,than any of these. But if I shall sow the seeds of death and fate for
9087,BOOK XVII.,"the wooers, then gladly bring me to the house the gifts that I will"
9088,BOOK XVII.,gladly take.”
9089,BOOK XVII.,
9090,BOOK XVII.,Therewith he led the travel-worn stranger to the house. Now when they
9091,BOOK XVII.,"came to the fair-lying palace, they laid aside their mantles on the"
9092,BOOK XVII.,"chairs and high seats, and went to the polished baths, and bathed them."
9093,BOOK XVII.,"So when the maidens had bathed them and anointed them with olive oil,"
9094,BOOK XVII.,"and cast about them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from"
9095,BOOK XVII.,"the baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare water for the"
9096,BOOK XVII.,"hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin"
9097,BOOK XVII.,"to wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And the grave"
9098,BOOK XVII.,"dame bare wheaten bread, and set it by them, and laid on the board many"
9099,BOOK XVII.,"dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. And the"
9100,BOOK XVII.,"mother of Telemachus sat over against him by the pillar of the hall,"
9101,BOOK XVII.,"leaning against a chair, and spinning the slender threads from the"
9102,BOOK XVII.,yarn. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set
9103,BOOK XVII.,before them. Now when they had put from them the desire of meat and
9104,BOOK XVII.,"drink, the wise Penelope first spake among them:"
9105,BOOK XVII.,
9106,BOOK XVII.,"“Telemachus, verily I will go up to my upper chamber, and lay me in my"
9107,BOOK XVII.,"bed, the place of my groanings, that is ever watered by my tears, since"
9108,BOOK XVII.,the day that Odysseus departed with the sons of Atreus for Ilios. Yet
9109,BOOK XVII.,"thou hadst no care to tell me clearly, before the lordly wooers came to"
9110,BOOK XVII.,"this house, concerning the returning of thy father, if haply thou hast"
9111,BOOK XVII.,heard thereof.”
9112,BOOK XVII.,
9113,BOOK XVII.,"And wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “Yea now, mother, I will tell"
9114,BOOK XVII.,"thee all the truth. We went to Pylos and to Nestor, the shepherd of the"
9115,BOOK XVII.,"people, and he received me in his lofty house, and was diligent to"
9116,BOOK XVII.,"entreat me lovingly, as a father might his son that had but newly come"
9117,BOOK XVII.,from strange lands after many years; even so diligently he cared for me
9118,BOOK XVII.,with his renowned sons. Yet he said that he had heard no word from any
9119,BOOK XVII.,"man on earth concerning Odysseus, of the hardy heart, whether alive or"
9120,BOOK XVII.,"dead. But he sent me forward on my way with horses and a chariot, well"
9121,BOOK XVII.,"compact, to Menelaus, son of Atreus, spearman renowned. There I saw"
9122,BOOK XVII.,"Argive Helen, for whose sake the Argives and Trojans bore much travail"
9123,BOOK XVII.,"by the gods’ designs. Then straightway Menelaus, of the loud war-cry,"
9124,BOOK XVII.,asked me on what quest I had come to goodly Lacedaemon. And I told him
9125,BOOK XVII.,"all the truth. Then he made answer, and spake, saying:"
9126,BOOK XVII.,
9127,BOOK XVII.,"“‘Out upon them, for truly in the bed of a brave-hearted man were they"
9128,BOOK XVII.,"minded to lie, very cravens as they are! Even as when a hind hath"
9129,BOOK XVII.,"couched her newborn fawns unweaned in a strong lion’s lair, and"
9130,BOOK XVII.,"searcheth out the mountain-knees and grassy hollows, seeking pasture;"
9131,BOOK XVII.,"and afterward the lion cometh back to his bed, and sendeth forth"
9132,BOOK XVII.,"unsightly death upon that pair, even so shall Odysseus send forth"
9133,BOOK XVII.,"unsightly death upon the wooers. Would to our father Zeus, and Athene,"
9134,BOOK XVII.,"and Apollo, would that in such might as when of old in stablished"
9135,BOOK XVII.,"Lesbos he rose up in strife and wrestled with Philomeleides, and threw"
9136,BOOK XVII.,"him mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced; would that in such"
9137,BOOK XVII.,strength Odysseus might consort with the wooers; then should they all
9138,BOOK XVII.,have swift fate and bitter wedlock! But for that whereof thou askest
9139,BOOK XVII.,"and entreatest me, be sure I will not swerve from the truth in aught"
9140,BOOK XVII.,"that I say, nor deceive thee; but of all that the ancient one of the"
9141,BOOK XVII.,"sea, whose speech is sooth, declared to me, not a word will I hide or"
9142,BOOK XVII.,"keep from thee. He said that he saw Odysseus in an island, suffering"
9143,BOOK XVII.,"strong pains in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who holds him there"
9144,BOOK XVII.,"perforce; so that he may not come to his own country, for he has by him"
9145,BOOK XVII.,"no ships with oars, and no companions to send him on his way over the"
9146,BOOK XVII.,"broad back of the sea.’ So spake Menelaus, son of Atreus, spearsman"
9147,BOOK XVII.,"renowned. Then having fulfilled all, I set out for home, and the"
9148,BOOK XVII.,"deathless gods gave me a fair wind, and brought me swiftly to mine own"
9149,BOOK XVII.,dear country.”
9150,BOOK XVII.,
9151,BOOK XVII.,"So he spake, and stirred her heart within her breast. And next the"
9152,BOOK XVII.,godlike Theoclymenus spake among them:
9153,BOOK XVII.,
9154,BOOK XVII.,"“O wife revered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, verily he hath no clear"
9155,BOOK XVII.,"knowledge; but my word do thou mark, for I will prophesy to thee most"
9156,BOOK XVII.,"truly and hide nought. Now Zeus be witness before any god, and this"
9157,BOOK XVII.,"hospitable board and this hearth of noble Odysseus, whereunto I am"
9158,BOOK XVII.,"come, that Odysseus is even now of a surety in his own country, resting"
9159,BOOK XVII.,"or faring, learning of these evil deeds, and sowing the seeds of evil"
9160,BOOK XVII.,for all the wooers. So clear was the omen of the bird that I saw as I
9161,BOOK XVII.,"sat on the decked ship, and I proclaimed it to Telemachus.”"
9162,BOOK XVII.,
9163,BOOK XVII.,"Then wise Penelope answered him, saying: “Ah, stranger, would that this"
9164,BOOK XVII.,thy word may be accomplished! Soon shouldest thou be aware of kindness
9165,BOOK XVII.,"and of many a gift at my hands, so that whoso met with thee would call"
9166,BOOK XVII.,thee blessed.”
9167,BOOK XVII.,
9168,BOOK XVII.,Thus they spake one to the other. But the wooers meantime were before
9169,BOOK XVII.,"the palace of Odysseus, taking their pleasure in casting of weights and"
9170,BOOK XVII.,"of spears on a levelled place, as heretofore, in their insolence. But"
9171,BOOK XVII.,"when it was now the hour for supper, and the flocks came home from the"
9172,BOOK XVII.,"fields all around, and the men led them whose custom it was, then"
9173,BOOK XVII.,"Medon, who of all the henchmen was most to their mind, and was ever"
9174,BOOK XVII.,"with them at the feast, spake to them, saying:"
9175,BOOK XVII.,
9176,BOOK XVII.,"“Noble youths, now that ye have had sport to your hearts’ content, get"
9177,BOOK XVII.,"you into the house, that we may make ready a feast; for truly it is no"
9178,BOOK XVII.,bad thing to take meat in season.”
9179,BOOK XVII.,
9180,BOOK XVII.,"Even so he spake, and they rose up and departed, and were obedient to"
9181,BOOK XVII.,"his word. Now when they were come into the fair-lying house, they laid"
9182,BOOK XVII.,"aside their mantles on the chairs and high seats, and they sacrificed"
9183,BOOK XVII.,"great sheep and stout goats, yea, and the fatlings of the boars and an"
9184,BOOK XVII.,"heifer of the herd, and got ready the feast."
9185,BOOK XVII.,
9186,BOOK XVII.,Now all this while Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were bestirring
9187,BOOK XVII.,"them to go from the field to the city; and the swineherd, a master of"
9188,BOOK XVII.,"men, spake first saying:"
9189,BOOK XVII.,
9190,BOOK XVII.,"“Well, my friend, forasmuch as I see thou art eager to be going to the"
9191,BOOK XVII.,"city to-day, even as my master gave command;—though myself I would well"
9192,BOOK XVII.,"that thou shouldest be left here to keep the steading, but I hold him"
9193,BOOK XVII.,"in reverence and fear, lest he chide me afterwards, and grievous are"
9194,BOOK XVII.,"the rebukes of masters—come then, let us go on our way, for lo, the day"
9195,BOOK XVII.,"is far spent, and soon wilt thou find it colder toward evening.”"
9196,BOOK XVII.,
9197,BOOK XVII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “I mark, I heed:"
9198,BOOK XVII.,"all this thou speakest to one with understanding. But let us be going,"
9199,BOOK XVII.,and be thou my guide withal to the end. And if thou hast anywhere a
9200,BOOK XVII.,"staff ready cut, give it me to lean upon, for truly ye said that"
9201,BOOK XVII.,slippery was the way.”
9202,BOOK XVII.,
9203,BOOK XVII.,"Therewith he cast about his shoulders a mean scrip, all tattered, and a"
9204,BOOK XVII.,"cord withal to hang it, and Eumaeus gave him a staff to his mind. So"
9205,BOOK XVII.,"these twain went on their way, and the dogs and the herdsmen stayed"
9206,BOOK XVII.,behind to guard the steading. And the swineherd led his lord to the
9207,BOOK XVII.,"city in the guise of a beggar, a wretched man and an old, leaning on a"
9208,BOOK XVII.,staff; and sorry was the raiment wherewith he was clothed upon. But as
9209,BOOK XVII.,"they fared along the rugged path they drew near to the town, and came"
9210,BOOK XVII.,"to the fair flowing spring, with a basin fashioned, whence the people"
9211,BOOK XVII.,of the city drew water. This well Ithacus and Neritus and Polyctor had
9212,BOOK XVII.,"builded. And around it was a thicket of alders that grow by the waters,"
9213,BOOK XVII.,"all circlewise, and down the cold stream fell from a rock on high, and"
9214,BOOK XVII.,"above was reared an altar to the Nymphs, whereat all wayfarers made"
9215,BOOK XVII.,"offering. In that place Melanthius, son of Dolius, met them, leading"
9216,BOOK XVII.,"his goats to feast the wooers, the best goats that were in all the"
9217,BOOK XVII.,herds; and two herdsmen bare him company. Now when he saw them he
9218,BOOK XVII.,"reviled them, and spake and hailed them, in terrible and evil fashion,"
9219,BOOK XVII.,"and stirred the heart of Odysseus, saying:"
9220,BOOK XVII.,
9221,BOOK XVII.,"“Now in very truth the vile is leading the vile, for god brings ever"
9222,BOOK XVII.,"like to like! Say, whither art thou leading this glutton,—thou wretched"
9223,BOOK XVII.,"swineherd,—this plaguy beggar, a kill-joy of the feast? He is one to"
9224,BOOK XVII.,"stand about and rub his shoulders against many doorposts, begging for"
9225,BOOK XVII.,"scraps of meat, not for swords or cauldrons. If thou wouldst give me"
9226,BOOK XVII.,"the fellow to watch my steading and sweep out the stalls, and carry"
9227,BOOK XVII.,"fresh fodder to the kids, then he might drink whey and get him a stout"
9228,BOOK XVII.,"thigh. Howbeit, since he is practised only in evil, he will not care to"
9229,BOOK XVII.,"betake him to the labour of the farm, but rather chooses to go louting"
9230,BOOK XVII.,through the land asking alms to fill his insatiate belly. But now I
9231,BOOK XVII.,will speak out and my word shall surely be accomplished. If ever he
9232,BOOK XVII.,"fares to the house of divine Odysseus, many a stool that men’s hands"
9233,BOOK XVII.,"hurl shall fly about his head, and break upon his ribs,[28] as they"
9234,BOOK XVII.,pelt him through the house.”
9235,BOOK XVII.,
9236,BOOK XVII.,[28] Reading πλευραί.
9237,BOOK XVII.,
9238,BOOK XVII.,
9239,BOOK XVII.,"Therewith, as he went past, he kicked Odysseus on the hip, in his"
9240,BOOK XVII.,"witlessness, yet he drave him not from the path, but he abode"
9241,BOOK XVII.,steadfast. And Odysseus pondered whether he should rush upon him and
9242,BOOK XVII.,"take away his life with the staff, or lift him in his grasp[29] and"
9243,BOOK XVII.,smite his head to the earth. Yet he hardened his heart to endure and
9244,BOOK XVII.,refrained himself. And the swineherd looked at the other and rebuked
9245,BOOK XVII.,"him, and lifting up his hands prayed aloud:"
9246,BOOK XVII.,
9247,BOOK XVII.,[29] ἀμφουδὶς is perhaps best taken as an adverb in -δις formed from
9248,BOOK XVII.,"ἀμφὶ, though some letters of the word are still left obscure. Most"
9249,BOOK XVII.,"modern commentators, however, derive it from ἀμφὶ and οὖδας “near the"
9250,BOOK XVII.,"ground; hence, in this context, “lift him _by the feet_.”"
9251,BOOK XVII.,
9252,BOOK XVII.,
9253,BOOK XVII.,"“Nymphs of the well-water, daughters of Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned"
9254,BOOK XVII.,"on your altars pieces of the thighs of rams or kids, in their covering"
9255,BOOK XVII.,"of rich fat, fulfil for me this wish:—oh that he, even he, may come"
9256,BOOK XVII.,"home, and that some god may bring him! Then would he scatter all thy"
9257,BOOK XVII.,"bravery, which now thou flauntest insolently, wandering ever about the"
9258,BOOK XVII.,"city, while evil shepherds destroy the flock.”"
9259,BOOK XVII.,
9260,BOOK XVII.,"Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered: “Lo now, what a word has this"
9261,BOOK XVII.,evil-witted dog been saying! Some day I will take him in a black decked
9262,BOOK XVII.,"ship far from Ithaca, that he may bring me in much livelihood. Would"
9263,BOOK XVII.,"God that Apollo, of the silver bow, might smite Telemachus to-day in"
9264,BOOK XVII.,"the halls, or that he might fall before the wooers, so surely as for"
9265,BOOK XVII.,Odysseus the day of returning has in a far land gone by!”
9266,BOOK XVII.,
9267,BOOK XVII.,So he spake and left them there as they walked slowly on. But
9268,BOOK XVII.,"Melanthius stepped forth, and came very speedily to the house of the"
9269,BOOK XVII.,"prince, and straightway he went in and sat down among the wooers, over"
9270,BOOK XVII.,"against Eurymachus, who chiefly showed him kindness. And they that"
9271,BOOK XVII.,"ministered set by him a portion of flesh, and the grave dame brought"
9272,BOOK XVII.,wheaten bread and set it by him to eat. Now Odysseus and the goodly
9273,BOOK XVII.,"swineherd drew near and stood by, and the sound of the hollow lyre rang"
9274,BOOK XVII.,"around them, for Phemius was lifting up his voice amid the company in"
9275,BOOK XVII.,"song, and Odysseus caught the swineherd by the hand, and spake, saying:"
9276,BOOK XVII.,
9277,BOOK XVII.,"“Eumaeus, verily this is the fair house of Odysseus, and right easily"
9278,BOOK XVII.,might it be known and marked even among many. There is building beyond
9279,BOOK XVII.,"building, and the court of the house is cunningly wrought with a wall"
9280,BOOK XVII.,"and battlements, and well-fenced are the folding doors; no man may hold"
9281,BOOK XVII.,"it in disdain. And I see that many men keep revel within, for the"
9282,BOOK XVII.,"savour of the fat rises upward,[30] and the voice of the lyre is heard"
9283,BOOK XVII.,"there, which the gods have made to be the mate of the feast.”"
9284,BOOK XVII.,
9285,BOOK XVII.,[30] Reading ἀνήνοφεν.
9286,BOOK XVII.,
9287,BOOK XVII.,
9288,BOOK XVII.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “Easily thou knowest"
9289,BOOK XVII.,"it, for indeed thou never lackest understanding. But come, let us"
9290,BOOK XVII.,"advise us, how things shall fall out here. Either do thou go first"
9291,BOOK XVII.,"within the fair-lying halls, and join the company of the wooers, so"
9292,BOOK XVII.,"will I remain here, or if thou wilt, abide here, and I will go before"
9293,BOOK XVII.,"thy face, and tarry not long, lest one see thee without, and hurl at"
9294,BOOK XVII.,"thee or strike thee. Look well to this, I bid thee.”"
9295,BOOK XVII.,
9296,BOOK XVII.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying: “I mark, I"
9297,BOOK XVII.,"heed, all this thou speakest to one with understanding. Do thou then go"
9298,BOOK XVII.,"before me, and I will remain here, for well I know what it is to be"
9299,BOOK XVII.,"smitten and hurled at. My heart is full of hardiness, for much evil"
9300,BOOK XVII.,have I suffered in perils of waves and war; let this be added to the
9301,BOOK XVII.,"tale of those. But a ravening belly may none conceal, a thing accursed,"
9302,BOOK XVII.,that works much ill for men. For this cause too the benched ships are
9303,BOOK XVII.,"furnished, that bear mischief to foemen over the unharvested seas.”"
9304,BOOK XVII.,
9305,BOOK XVII.,"Thus they spake one to the other. And lo, a hound raised up his head"
9306,BOOK XVII.,"and pricked his ears, even where he lay, Argos, the hound of Odysseus,"
9307,BOOK XVII.,"of the hardy heart, which of old himself had bred, but had got no joy"
9308,BOOK XVII.,"of him, for ere that, he went to sacred Ilios. Now in time past the"
9309,BOOK XVII.,young men used to lead the hound against wild goats and deer and hares;
9310,BOOK XVII.,"but as then, despised he lay (his master being afar) in the deep dung"
9311,BOOK XVII.,"of mules and kine, whereof an ample bed was spread before the doors,"
9312,BOOK XVII.,till the thralls of Odysseus should carry it away to dung therewith his
9313,BOOK XVII.,"wide demesne. There lay the dog Argos, full of vermin. Yet even now"
9314,BOOK XVII.,"when he was ware of Odysseus standing by, he wagged his tail and"
9315,BOOK XVII.,"dropped both his ears, but nearer to his master he had not now the"
9316,BOOK XVII.,strength to draw. But Odysseus looked aside and wiped away a tear that
9317,BOOK XVII.,"he easily hid from Eumaeus, and straightway he asked him, saying:"
9318,BOOK XVII.,
9319,BOOK XVII.,"“Eumaeus, verily this is a great marvel, this hound lying here in the"
9320,BOOK XVII.,"dung. Truly he is goodly of growth, but I know not certainly if he have"
9321,BOOK XVII.,"speed with this beauty, or if he be comely only, like as are men’s"
9322,BOOK XVII.,trencher dogs that their lords keep for the pleasure of the eye.”
9323,BOOK XVII.,
9324,BOOK XVII.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “In very truth this is"
9325,BOOK XVII.,the dog of a man that has died in a far land. If he were what once he
9326,BOOK XVII.,"was in limb and in the feats of the chase, when Odysseus left him to go"
9327,BOOK XVII.,"to Troy, soon wouldst thou marvel at the sight of his swiftness and his"
9328,BOOK XVII.,strength. There was no beast that could flee from him in the deep
9329,BOOK XVII.,"places of the wood, when he was in pursuit; for even on a track he was"
9330,BOOK XVII.,"the keenest hound. But now he is holden in an evil case, and his lord"
9331,BOOK XVII.,"hath perished far from his own country, and the careless women take no"
9332,BOOK XVII.,"charge of him. Nay, thralls are no more inclined to honest service when"
9333,BOOK XVII.,"their masters have lost the dominion, for Zeus, of the far-borne voice,"
9334,BOOK XVII.,"takes away the half of a man’s virtue, when the day of slavery comes"
9335,BOOK XVII.,upon him.”
9336,BOOK XVII.,
9337,BOOK XVII.,"Therewith he passed within the fair-lying house, and went straight to"
9338,BOOK XVII.,"the hall, to the company of the proud wooers. But upon Argos came the"
9339,BOOK XVII.,"fate of black death even in the hour that he beheld Odysseus again, in"
9340,BOOK XVII.,the twentieth year.
9341,BOOK XVII.,
9342,BOOK XVII.,Now godlike Telemachus was far the first to behold the swineherd as he
9343,BOOK XVII.,"came into the hall, and straightway then he beckoned and called him to"
9344,BOOK XVII.,"his side. So Eumaeus looked about and took a settle that lay by him,"
9345,BOOK XVII.,where the carver was wont to sit dividing much flesh among the wooers
9346,BOOK XVII.,that were feasting in the house. This seat he carried and set by the
9347,BOOK XVII.,"table of Telemachus over against him, and there sat down himself. And"
9348,BOOK XVII.,"the henchman took a mess and served it him, and wheaten bread out of"
9349,BOOK XVII.,the basket.
9350,BOOK XVII.,
9351,BOOK XVII.,And close behind him Odysseus entered the house in the guise of a
9352,BOOK XVII.,"beggar, a wretched man and an old, leaning on his staff, and clothed on"
9353,BOOK XVII.,with sorry raiment. And he sat down on the ashen threshold within the
9354,BOOK XVII.,"doorway, leaning against a pillar of cypress wood, which the carpenter"
9355,BOOK XVII.,"on a time had deftly planed, and thereon made straight the line. And"
9356,BOOK XVII.,"Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and took a whole loaf out of"
9357,BOOK XVII.,"the fair basket, and of flesh so much as his hands could hold in their"
9358,BOOK XVII.,"grasp, saying:"
9359,BOOK XVII.,
9360,BOOK XVII.,"“Take and give this to the stranger, and bid him go about and beg"
9361,BOOK XVII.,"himself of all the wooers in their turn, for shame is an ill mate of a"
9362,BOOK XVII.,needy man.”
9363,BOOK XVII.,
9364,BOOK XVII.,"So he spake, and the swineherd went when he heard that saying, and"
9365,BOOK XVII.,stood by and spake to him winged words:
9366,BOOK XVII.,
9367,BOOK XVII.,"“Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these and bids thee go about and beg"
9368,BOOK XVII.,"of all the wooers in their turn, for, he says, ‘shame ill becomes a"
9369,BOOK XVII.,beggar man.’”
9370,BOOK XVII.,
9371,BOOK XVII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: “King Zeus, grant"
9372,BOOK XVII.,"me that Telemachus may be happy among men, and may he have all his"
9373,BOOK XVII.,heart’s desire!”
9374,BOOK XVII.,
9375,BOOK XVII.,"Therewith he took the gift in both hands, and set it there before his"
9376,BOOK XVII.,feet on his unsightly scrip. Then he ate meat so long as the minstrel
9377,BOOK XVII.,"was singing in the halls. When he had done supper, and the divine"
9378,BOOK XVII.,"minstrel was ending his song, then the wooers raised a clamour through"
9379,BOOK XVII.,"the halls; but Athene stood by Odysseus, son of Laertes, and moved him"
9380,BOOK XVII.,"to go gathering morsels of bread among the wooers, and learn which were"
9381,BOOK XVII.,righteous and which unjust. Yet not even so was she fated to redeem one
9382,BOOK XVII.,"man of them from an evil doom. So he set out, beginning on the right,"
9383,BOOK XVII.,"to ask of each man, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he"
9384,BOOK XVII.,"were a beggar from of old. And they in pity gave him somewhat, and were"
9385,BOOK XVII.,"amazed at the man, asking one another who he was and whence he came?"
9386,BOOK XVII.,
9387,BOOK XVII.,"Then Melanthius, the goatherd, spake among them:"
9388,BOOK XVII.,
9389,BOOK XVII.,"“Listen, ye wooers of the renowned queen, concerning this stranger, for"
9390,BOOK XVII.,verily I have seen him before. The swineherd truly was his guide
9391,BOOK XVII.,"hither, but of him I have no certain knowledge, whence he avows him to"
9392,BOOK XVII.,be born.”
9393,BOOK XVII.,
9394,BOOK XVII.,"So spake he, but Antinous rebuked the swineherd, saying: “Oh notorious"
9395,BOOK XVII.,"swineherd, wherefore, I pray thee, didst thou bring this man to the"
9396,BOOK XVII.,"city? Have we not vagrants enough besides, plaguy beggars, kill-joys of"
9397,BOOK XVII.,the feast? Dost thou count it a light thing that they assemble here and
9398,BOOK XVII.,"devour the living of thy master, but thou must needs[31] call in this"
9399,BOOK XVII.,man too?”
9400,BOOK XVII.,
9401,BOOK XVII.,"[31] πόθι can hardly have a _local_ meaning here. If retained, it must"
9402,BOOK XVII.,"be nearly equivalent to πού, “it seems,” with a touch of irony. Cf. i."
9403,BOOK XVII.,"348. The v. 1. προτὶ = πρὸς is a simpler reading, but by no means"
9404,BOOK XVII.,certain.
9405,BOOK XVII.,
9406,BOOK XVII.,
9407,BOOK XVII.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “Antinous, no fair"
9408,BOOK XVII.,"words are these of thine, noble though thou art. For who ever himself"
9409,BOOK XVII.,"seeks out and bids to the feast a stranger from afar, save only one of"
9410,BOOK XVII.,"those that are craftsmen of the people, a prophet or a healer of ills,"
9411,BOOK XVII.,"or a shipwright or even a godlike minstrel, who can delight all with"
9412,BOOK XVII.,"his song? Nay, these are the men that are welcome over all the wide"
9413,BOOK XVII.,"earth. But none would call a beggar to the banquet, to waste his"
9414,BOOK XVII.,substance. But thou art ever hard above all the other wooers to the
9415,BOOK XVII.,"servants of Odysseus, and, beyond all, to me; but behold, I care not,"
9416,BOOK XVII.,"so long as my mistress, the constant Penelope, lives in the halls and"
9417,BOOK XVII.,godlike Telemachus.”
9418,BOOK XVII.,
9419,BOOK XVII.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Be silent, answer him not,"
9420,BOOK XVII.,"I pray thee, with many words, for Antinous is wont ever to chide us"
9421,BOOK XVII.,"shamefully with bitter speech, yea, and urges the others thereto.”"
9422,BOOK XVII.,
9423,BOOK XVII.,"Therewithal he spake winged words to Antinous: “Antinous, verily thou"
9424,BOOK XVII.,"hast a good care for me, as it were a father for his son, thou that"
9425,BOOK XVII.,biddest me drive our guest from the hall with a harsh command. God
9426,BOOK XVII.,"forbid that such a thing should be! Take somewhat and give it him: lo,"
9427,BOOK XVII.,"I grudge it not; nay, I charge thee to do it. And herein regard not my"
9428,BOOK XVII.,"mother, nor any of the thralls that are in the house of divine"
9429,BOOK XVII.,"Odysseus. Nay, but thou hast no such thought in thy heart, for thou art"
9430,BOOK XVII.,far more fain to eat thyself than to give to another.”
9431,BOOK XVII.,
9432,BOOK XVII.,"Then Antinous answered him and spake, saying: “Telemachus, proud of"
9433,BOOK XVII.,"speech, and unrestrained in fury, what word hast thou spoken? If all"
9434,BOOK XVII.,"the wooers should vouchsafe him as much as I, this house would keep him"
9435,BOOK XVII.,far enough aloof even for three months’ space.”
9436,BOOK XVII.,
9437,BOOK XVII.,"So he spake, and seized the footstool whereon he rested his sleek feet"
9438,BOOK XVII.,"as he sat at the feast, and showed it from beneath the table where it"
9439,BOOK XVII.,lay. But all the others gave somewhat and filled the wallet with bread
9440,BOOK XVII.,"and flesh; yea, and even now, Odysseus as he returned to the threshold,"
9441,BOOK XVII.,"was like to escape scot free, making trial of the Achaeans, but he"
9442,BOOK XVII.,"halted by Antinous, and spake to him, saying:"
9443,BOOK XVII.,
9444,BOOK XVII.,"“Friend, give me somewhat; for methinks thou art not the basest of the"
9445,BOOK XVII.,"Achaeans, but the best man of them all, for thou art like a king."
9446,BOOK XVII.,"Wherefore thou shouldest give me a portion of bread, and that a better"
9447,BOOK XVII.,than the others; so would I make thee renowned over all the wide earth.
9448,BOOK XVII.,"For I too, once had a house of mine own among men, a rich man with a"
9449,BOOK XVII.,"wealthy house, and many a time would I give to a wanderer, what manner"
9450,BOOK XVII.,"of man soever he might be, and in whatsoever need he came. And I had"
9451,BOOK XVII.,"thralls out of number, and all else in plenty, wherewith folk live well"
9452,BOOK XVII.,"and have a name for riches. But Zeus, the son of Cronos, made me"
9453,BOOK XVII.,"desolate of all,—for surely it was his will,—who sent me with wandering"
9454,BOOK XVII.,"sea-robbers to go to Egypt, a far road, to my ruin. And in the river"
9455,BOOK XVII.,Aegyptus I stayed my curved ships. Then verily I bade my loved
9456,BOOK XVII.,"companions to abide there by the ships, and to guard the ship, and I"
9457,BOOK XVII.,sent forth scouts to range the points of outlook. Now they gave place
9458,BOOK XVII.,"to wantonness, being the fools of their own force, and soon they fell"
9459,BOOK XVII.,"to wasting the fields of the Egyptians, exceeding fair, and carried"
9460,BOOK XVII.,"away their wives and infant children, and slew the men. And the cry"
9461,BOOK XVII.,"came quickly to the city, and the people heard the shout and came forth"
9462,BOOK XVII.,at the breaking of the day; and all the plain was filled with footmen
9463,BOOK XVII.,"and horsemen and with the glitter of bronze. And Zeus, whose joy is in"
9464,BOOK XVII.,"the thunder, sent an evil panic upon my company, and none durst stand"
9465,BOOK XVII.,and face the foe: for danger encompassed us on every side. There they
9466,BOOK XVII.,"slew many of us with the edge of the sword, and others they led up with"
9467,BOOK XVII.,them alive to work for them perforce. But they gave me to a friend who
9468,BOOK XVII.,"met them, to take to Cyprus, even to Dmetor son of Iasus, who ruled"
9469,BOOK XVII.,"mightily over Cyprus; and thence, behold, am I now come hither in sore"
9470,BOOK XVII.,distress.”
9471,BOOK XVII.,
9472,BOOK XVII.,"Then Antinous answered, and spake, saying: “What god hath brought this"
9473,BOOK XVII.,"plague hither to trouble the feast? Stand forth thus in the midst, away"
9474,BOOK XVII.,"from my table, lest thou come soon to a bitter Egypt and a sad Cyprus;"
9475,BOOK XVII.,for a bold beggar art thou and a shameless. Thou standest by all in
9476,BOOK XVII.,"turn and recklessly they give to thee, for they hold not their hand nor"
9477,BOOK XVII.,"feel any ruth in giving freely of others’ goods, for that each man has"
9478,BOOK XVII.,plenty by him.”
9479,BOOK XVII.,
9480,BOOK XVII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels drew back and answered him: “Lo now, I"
9481,BOOK XVII.,see thou hast not wisdom with thy beauty! From out of thine own house
9482,BOOK XVII.,thou wouldest not give even so much as a grain of salt to thy
9483,BOOK XVII.,"suppliant, thou who now even at another’s board dost sit, and canst not"
9484,BOOK XVII.,"find it in thy heart to take of the bread and give it me, where there"
9485,BOOK XVII.,is plenty to thy hand.”
9486,BOOK XVII.,
9487,BOOK XVII.,"He spake, and Antinous was mightily angered at heart, and looked"
9488,BOOK XVII.,fiercely on him and spake winged words:
9489,BOOK XVII.,
9490,BOOK XVII.,"“Henceforth, methinks, thou shalt not get thee out with honour from the"
9491,BOOK XVII.,"hall, seeing thou dost even rail upon me.”"
9492,BOOK XVII.,
9493,BOOK XVII.,Therewith he caught up the foot-stool and smote Odysseus at the base of
9494,BOOK XVII.,"the right shoulder by the back. But he stood firm as a rock, nor reeled"
9495,BOOK XVII.,"he beneath the blow of Antinous, but shook his head in silence,"
9496,BOOK XVII.,brooding evil in the deep of his heart. Then he went back to the
9497,BOOK XVII.,"threshold, and sat him there, and laid down his well-filled scrip, and"
9498,BOOK XVII.,spake among the wooers:
9499,BOOK XVII.,
9500,BOOK XVII.,"“Hear me, ye wooers of the renowned queen, and I will say what my"
9501,BOOK XVII.,spirit within me bids me. Verily there is neither pain nor grief of
9502,BOOK XVII.,"heart, when a man is smitten in battle fighting for his own"
9503,BOOK XVII.,"possessions, whether cattle or white sheep. But now Antinous hath"
9504,BOOK XVII.,"stricken me for my wretched belly’s sake, a thing accursed, that works"
9505,BOOK XVII.,"much ill for men. Ah, if indeed there be gods and Avengers of beggars,"
9506,BOOK XVII.,may the issues of death come upon Antinous before his wedding!”
9507,BOOK XVII.,
9508,BOOK XVII.,"Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Sit and eat thy meat in"
9509,BOOK XVII.,"quiet, stranger, or get thee elsewhere, lest the young men drag thee by"
9510,BOOK XVII.,"hand or foot through the house for thy evil words, and strip all thy"
9511,BOOK XVII.,flesh from off thee.”
9512,BOOK XVII.,
9513,BOOK XVII.,"Even so he spake, and they were all exceeding wroth at his word. And on"
9514,BOOK XVII.,this wise would one of the lordly young men speak:
9515,BOOK XVII.,
9516,BOOK XVII.,"“Antinous, thou didst ill to strike the hapless wanderer, doomed man"
9517,BOOK XVII.,"that thou art,—if indeed there be a god in heaven. Yea and the gods, in"
9518,BOOK XVII.,"the likeness of strangers from far countries, put on all manner of"
9519,BOOK XVII.,"shapes, and wander through the cities, beholding the violence and the"
9520,BOOK XVII.,righteousness of men.”
9521,BOOK XVII.,
9522,BOOK XVII.,"So the wooers spake, but he heeded not their words. Now Telemachus"
9523,BOOK XVII.,"nursed in his heart a mighty grief at the smiting of Odysseus, yet he"
9524,BOOK XVII.,"let no tear fall from his eyelids to the ground, but shook his head in"
9525,BOOK XVII.,"silence, brooding evil in the deep of his heart."
9526,BOOK XVII.,
9527,BOOK XVII.,Now when wise Penelope heard of the stranger being smitten in the
9528,BOOK XVII.,"halls, she spake among her maidens, saying:"
9529,BOOK XVII.,
9530,BOOK XVII.,"“Oh that Apollo, the famed archer, may so smite thee thyself,"
9531,BOOK XVII.,Antinous!”
9532,BOOK XVII.,
9533,BOOK XVII.,"And the house-dame, Eurynome, answered her, saying: “Oh that we might"
9534,BOOK XVII.,win fulfilment of our prayers! So should not one of these men come to
9535,BOOK XVII.,the fair-throned Dawn.”
9536,BOOK XVII.,
9537,BOOK XVII.,"And wise Penelope answered her: “Nurse, they are all enemies, for they"
9538,BOOK XVII.,"all devise evil continually, but of them all Antinous is the most like"
9539,BOOK XVII.,"to black fate. Some hapless stranger is roaming about the house,"
9540,BOOK XVII.,"begging alms of the men, as his need bids him; and all the others"
9541,BOOK XVII.,"filled his wallet and gave him somewhat, but Antinous smote him at the"
9542,BOOK XVII.,base of the right shoulder with a stool.”
9543,BOOK XVII.,
9544,BOOK XVII.,"So she spake among her maidens, sitting in her chamber, while goodly"
9545,BOOK XVII.,Odysseus was at meat. Then she called to her the goodly swineherd and
9546,BOOK XVII.,"spake, saying:"
9547,BOOK XVII.,
9548,BOOK XVII.,"“Go thy way, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come hither, that I"
9549,BOOK XVII.,"may speak him a word of greeting, and ask him if haply he has heard"
9550,BOOK XVII.,"tidings of Odysseus of the hardy heart, or seen him with his eyes; for"
9551,BOOK XVII.,he seems like one that has wandered far.”
9552,BOOK XVII.,
9553,BOOK XVII.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “Queen, oh that the"
9554,BOOK XVII.,"Achaeans would hold their peace! so would he charm thy very heart, such"
9555,BOOK XVII.,things doth he say. For I kept him three nights and three days I held
9556,BOOK XVII.,"him in the steading, for to me he came first when he fled from the"
9557,BOOK XVII.,"ship, yet he had not made an end of the tale of his affliction. Even as"
9558,BOOK XVII.,"when a man gazes on a singer, whom the gods have taught to sing words"
9559,BOOK XVII.,"of yearning joy to mortals, and they have a ceaseless desire to hear"
9560,BOOK XVII.,"him, so long as he will sing; even so he charmed me, sitting by me in"
9561,BOOK XVII.,"the halls. He says that he is a friend of Odysseus and of his house,"
9562,BOOK XVII.,"one that dwells in Crete, where is the race of Minos. Thence he has"
9563,BOOK XVII.,"come hither even now, with sorrow by the way, onward and yet onward"
9564,BOOK XVII.,wandering; and he stands to it that he has heard tidings of Odysseus
9565,BOOK XVII.,nigh at hand and yet alive in the fat land of the men of Thesprotia;
9566,BOOK XVII.,and he is bringing many treasures to his home.”
9567,BOOK XVII.,
9568,BOOK XVII.,"Then wise Penelope answered him, saying: “Go, call him hither, that he"
9569,BOOK XVII.,may speak to me face to face. But let these men sit in the doorway and
9570,BOOK XVII.,"take their pleasure, or even here in the house, since their heart is"
9571,BOOK XVII.,"glad. For their own wealth lies unspoiled at home, bread and sweet"
9572,BOOK XVII.,"wine, and thereon do their servants feed. But they resorting to our"
9573,BOOK XVII.,"house day by day sacrifice oxen and sheep and fat goats, and keep revel"
9574,BOOK XVII.,"and drink the dark wine recklessly; and, lo, our great wealth is"
9575,BOOK XVII.,"wasted, for there is no man now alive, such as Odysseus was, to keep"
9576,BOOK XVII.,"ruin from the house. Oh, if Odysseus might come again to his own"
9577,BOOK XVII.,country; soon would he and his son avenge the violence of these men!”
9578,BOOK XVII.,
9579,BOOK XVII.,"Even so she spake, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and around the roof"
9580,BOOK XVII.,"rang wondrously. And Penelope laughed, and straightway spake to Eumaeus"
9581,BOOK XVII.,winged words:
9582,BOOK XVII.,
9583,BOOK XVII.,"“Go, call me the stranger, even so, into my presence. Dost thou not"
9584,BOOK XVII.,mark how my son has sneezed a blessing on all my words? Wherefore no
9585,BOOK XVII.,"half-wrought doom shall befal the wooers every one, nor shall any avoid"
9586,BOOK XVII.,"death and the fates. Yet another thing will I say, and do thou ponder"
9587,BOOK XVII.,it in thy heart. If I shall find that he himself speaks nought but
9588,BOOK XVII.,"truth, I will clothe him with a mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment.”"
9589,BOOK XVII.,
9590,BOOK XVII.,"So she spake, and the swineherd departed when he heard that saying, and"
9591,BOOK XVII.,stood by the stranger and spake winged words:
9592,BOOK XVII.,
9593,BOOK XVII.,"“Father and stranger, wise Penelope, the mother of Telemachus, is"
9594,BOOK XVII.,"calling for thee, and her mind bids her inquire as touching her lord,"
9595,BOOK XVII.,albeit she has sorrowed much already. And if she shall find that thou
9596,BOOK XVII.,"dost speak nought but truth, she will clothe thee in a mantle and a"
9597,BOOK XVII.,"doublet, whereof thou standest most in need. Moreover thou shalt beg"
9598,BOOK XVII.,"thy bread through the land and shalt fill thy belly, and whosoever"
9599,BOOK XVII.,"will, shall give to thee.”"
9600,BOOK XVII.,
9601,BOOK XVII.,"Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying: “Eumaeus, soon"
9602,BOOK XVII.,"would I tell all the truth to the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,"
9603,BOOK XVII.,"for well I know his story, and we have borne our travail together. But"
9604,BOOK XVII.,"I tremble before the throng of the froward wooers, whose outrage and"
9605,BOOK XVII.,"violence reach even to the iron heaven. For even now, as I was going"
9606,BOOK XVII.,"through the house, when this man struck and pained me sore, and that"
9607,BOOK XVII.,"for no ill deed, neither Telemachus nor any other kept off the blow."
9608,BOOK XVII.,"Wherefore now, bid Penelope tarry in the chambers, for all her"
9609,BOOK XVII.,"eagerness, till the going down of the sun, and then let her ask me"
9610,BOOK XVII.,"concerning her lord, as touching the day of his returning, and let her"
9611,BOOK XVII.,"give me a seat yet nearer to the fire, for behold, I have sorry"
9612,BOOK XVII.,"raiment, and thou knowest it thyself, since I made my supplication"
9613,BOOK XVII.,first to thee.”
9614,BOOK XVII.,
9615,BOOK XVII.,"Even so he spake, and the swineherd departed when he heard that saying."
9616,BOOK XVII.,And as he crossed the threshold Penelope spake to him:
9617,BOOK XVII.,
9618,BOOK XVII.,"“Thou bringest him not, Eumaeus: what means the wanderer hereby? Can it"
9619,BOOK XVII.,"be that he fears some one out of measure, or is he even ashamed of"
9620,BOOK XVII.,tarrying in the house? A shamefaced man makes a bad beggar.”
9621,BOOK XVII.,
9622,BOOK XVII.,"Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “He speaks aright, and"
9623,BOOK XVII.,"but as another would deem, in that he shuns the outrage of overweening"
9624,BOOK XVII.,men. Rather would he have thee wait till the going down of the sun.
9625,BOOK XVII.,"Yea, and it is far meeter for thyself, O queen, to utter thy word to"
9626,BOOK XVII.,"the stranger alone, and to listen to his speech.”"
9627,BOOK XVII.,
9628,BOOK XVII.,Then the wise Penelope answered: “Not witless is the stranger; even as
9629,BOOK XVII.,"he deems, so it well may be.[32] For there are no mortal men, methinks,"
9630,BOOK XVII.,"so wanton as these, and none that devise such infatuate deeds.”"
9631,BOOK XVII.,
9632,BOOK XVII.,"[32] Placing at colon at ξεῖνος, and reading ὥς περ ἂν εἴη (cf. xix."
9633,BOOK XVII.,312).
9634,BOOK XVII.,
9635,BOOK XVII.,
9636,BOOK XVII.,"So she spake, and the goodly swineherd departed into the throng of the"
9637,BOOK XVII.,"wooers, when he had showed her all his message. And straightway he"
9638,BOOK XVII.,"spake to Telemachus winged words, holding his head close to him, that"
9639,BOOK XVII.,the others might not hear:
9640,BOOK XVII.,
9641,BOOK XVII.,"“Friend, I am going hence to look after thy swine and the things of the"
9642,BOOK XVII.,"farm, thy livelihood and mine; but do thou take charge of all that is"
9643,BOOK XVII.,here. Yet first look to thyself and take heed that no evil comes nigh
9644,BOOK XVII.,"thee, for many of the Achaeans have ill will against us, whom may Zeus"
9645,BOOK XVII.,confound before their mischief falls on us!”
9646,BOOK XVII.,
9647,BOOK XVII.,"And wise Telemachus answered him, and said: “Even so shall it be,"
9648,BOOK XVII.,"father; and do thou get thee on thy way, when thou hast supped. And in"
9649,BOOK XVII.,"the morning come again, and bring fair victims for sacrifice. And all"
9650,BOOK XVII.,these matters will be a care to me and to the deathless gods.”
9651,BOOK XVII.,
9652,BOOK XVII.,"Thus he spake, and the other sat down again on the polished settle; and"
9653,BOOK XVII.,"when he had satisfied his heart with meat and drink, he went on his way"
9654,BOOK XVII.,"to the swine, leaving the courts and the hall full of feasters; and"
9655,BOOK XVII.,"they were making merry with dance and song, for already it was close on"
9656,BOOK XVII.,eventide.
9657,BOOK XVII.,
9658,BOOK XVII.,
9659,BOOK XVII.,
9660,BOOK XVIII.,BOOK XVIII.
9661,BOOK XVIII.,
9662,BOOK XVIII.,
9663,BOOK XVIII.,The fighting at fists of Odysseus with Irus. His admonitions to
9664,BOOK XVIII.,"Amphinomus. Penelope appears before the wooers, and draws presents from"
9665,BOOK XVIII.,them.
9666,BOOK XVIII.,
9667,BOOK XVIII.,
9668,BOOK XVIII.,"Then up came a common beggar, who was wont to beg through the town of"
9669,BOOK XVIII.,"Ithaca, one that was known among all men for ravening greed, for his"
9670,BOOK XVIII.,"endless eating and drinking, yet he had no force or might, though he"
9671,BOOK XVIII.,"was bulky enough to look on. Arnaeus was his name, for so had his good"
9672,BOOK XVIII.,"mother given it him at his birth, but all the young men called him"
9673,BOOK XVIII.,"Irus, because he ran on errands, whensoever any might bid him. So now"
9674,BOOK XVIII.,"he came, and would have driven Odysseus from his own house, and began"
9675,BOOK XVIII.,"reviling him, and spake winged words:"
9676,BOOK XVIII.,
9677,BOOK XVIII.,"“Get thee hence, old man, from the doorway, lest thou be even haled out"
9678,BOOK XVIII.,"soon by the foot. Seest thou not that all are now giving me the wink,"
9679,BOOK XVIII.,"and bidding me drag thee forth? Nevertheless, I feel shame of the task."
9680,BOOK XVIII.,"Nay get thee up, lest our quarrel soon pass even to blows.”"
9681,BOOK XVIII.,
9682,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him, and spake"
9683,BOOK XVIII.,"saying: “Sir, neither in deed nor word do I harm thee, nor do I grudge"
9684,BOOK XVIII.,"that any should give to thee, yea though it were a good handful. But"
9685,BOOK XVIII.,"this threshold will hold us both, and thou hast no need to be jealous"
9686,BOOK XVIII.,"for the sake of other men’s goods. Thou seemest to me to be a wanderer,"
9687,BOOK XVIII.,"even as I am, and the gods it is that are like to give us gain. Only"
9688,BOOK XVIII.,"provoke me not overmuch to buffeting, lest thou anger me, and old"
9689,BOOK XVIII.,though I be I defile thy breast and lips with blood. Thereby should I
9690,BOOK XVIII.,"have the greater quiet to-morrow, for methinks that thou shalt never"
9691,BOOK XVIII.,"again come to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes”."
9692,BOOK XVIII.,
9693,BOOK XVIII.,"Then the beggar Irus spake unto him in anger: “Lo now, how trippingly"
9694,BOOK XVIII.,"and like an old cinder-wife this glutton speaks, on whom I will work my"
9695,BOOK XVIII.,"evil will, and smite him right and left, and drive all the teeth from"
9696,BOOK XVIII.,"his jaws to the ground, like the tusks of a swine that spoils the corn."
9697,BOOK XVIII.,"Gird thyself now, that even these men all may know our mettle in fight."
9698,BOOK XVIII.,"Nay, how shouldst thou do battle with a younger man than thou?”"
9699,BOOK XVIII.,
9700,BOOK XVIII.,Thus did they whet each the other’s rage right manfully before the
9701,BOOK XVIII.,lofty doors upon the polished threshold. And the mighty prince Antinous
9702,BOOK XVIII.,"heard the twain, and sweetly he laughed out, and spake among the"
9703,BOOK XVIII.,wooers:
9704,BOOK XVIII.,
9705,BOOK XVIII.,"“Friends, never before has there been such a thing; such goodly game"
9706,BOOK XVIII.,has a god brought to this house. The stranger yonder and Irus are
9707,BOOK XVIII.,"bidding each other to buffets. Quick, let us match them one against the"
9708,BOOK XVIII.,other.”
9709,BOOK XVIII.,
9710,BOOK XVIII.,"Then all at the word leaped up laughing, and gathered round the ragged"
9711,BOOK XVIII.,"beggars, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake among them saying: “Hear"
9712,BOOK XVIII.,"me, ye lordly wooers, and I will say somewhat. Here are goats’ bellies"
9713,BOOK XVIII.,"lying at the fire, that we laid by at supper-time and filled with fat"
9714,BOOK XVIII.,"and blood. Now whichsoever of the twain wins, and shows himself the"
9715,BOOK XVIII.,"better man, let him stand up and take his choice of these puddings. And"
9716,BOOK XVIII.,"further, he shall always eat at our feasts, nor will we suffer any"
9717,BOOK XVIII.,other beggar to come among us and ask for alms.”
9718,BOOK XVIII.,
9719,BOOK XVIII.,"So spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then Odysseus of"
9720,BOOK XVIII.,many counsels spake among them craftily:
9721,BOOK XVIII.,
9722,BOOK XVIII.,"“Friends, an old man and foredone with travail may in no wise fight"
9723,BOOK XVIII.,"with a younger. But my belly’s call is urgent on me, that evil-worker,"
9724,BOOK XVIII.,"to the end that I may be subdued with stripes. But come now, swear me"
9725,BOOK XVIII.,"all of you a strong oath, so that none, for the sake of shewing a"
9726,BOOK XVIII.,"favour to Irus, may strike me a foul blow with heavy hand and subdue me"
9727,BOOK XVIII.,by violence to my foe.”
9728,BOOK XVIII.,
9729,BOOK XVIII.,"So he spake, and they all swore not to strike him, as he bade them. Now"
9730,BOOK XVIII.,"when they had sworn and done that oath, the mighty prince Telemachus"
9731,BOOK XVIII.,once more spake among them:
9732,BOOK XVIII.,
9733,BOOK XVIII.,"“Stranger, if thy heart and lordly spirit urge thee to rid thee of this"
9734,BOOK XVIII.,"fellow, then fear not any other of the Achaeans, for whoso strikes thee"
9735,BOOK XVIII.,"shall have to fight with many. Thy host am I, and the princes consent"
9736,BOOK XVIII.,"with me, Antinous and Eurymachus, men of wisdom both.”"
9737,BOOK XVIII.,
9738,BOOK XVIII.,So spake he and they all consented thereto. Then Odysseus girt his rags
9739,BOOK XVIII.,"about his loins, and let his thighs be seen, goodly and great, and his"
9740,BOOK XVIII.,broad shoulders and breast and mighty arms were manifest. And Athene
9741,BOOK XVIII.,came nigh and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people.
9742,BOOK XVIII.,"Then the wooers were exceedingly amazed, and thus would one speak"
9743,BOOK XVIII.,looking to his neighbour:
9744,BOOK XVIII.,
9745,BOOK XVIII.,"“Right soon will Irus, un-Irused, have a bane of his own bringing, such"
9746,BOOK XVIII.,a thigh as that old man shows from out his rags!”
9747,BOOK XVIII.,
9748,BOOK XVIII.,"So they spake, and the mind of Irus was pitifully stirred; but even so"
9749,BOOK XVIII.,"the servants girded him and led him out perforce in great fear, his"
9750,BOOK XVIII.,"flesh trembling on his limbs. Then Antinous chid him, and spake and"
9751,BOOK XVIII.,hailed him:
9752,BOOK XVIII.,
9753,BOOK XVIII.,"“Thou lubber, better for thee that thou wert not now, nor ever hadst"
9754,BOOK XVIII.,"been born, if indeed thou tremblest before this man, and art so"
9755,BOOK XVIII.,"terribly afraid; an old man too he is, and foredone with the travail"
9756,BOOK XVIII.,"that is come upon him. But I will tell thee plainly, and it shall"
9757,BOOK XVIII.,surely be accomplished. If this man prevail against thee and prove thy
9758,BOOK XVIII.,"master, I will cast thee into a black ship, and send thee to the"
9759,BOOK XVIII.,"mainland to Echetus the king, the maimer of all mankind, who will cut"
9760,BOOK XVIII.,"off thy nose and ears with the pitiless steel, and draw out thy vitals"
9761,BOOK XVIII.,and give them raw to dogs to rend.”
9762,BOOK XVIII.,
9763,BOOK XVIII.,"So he spake, and yet greater trembling gat hold of the limbs of Irus,"
9764,BOOK XVIII.,"and they led him into the ring, and the twain put up their hands. Then"
9765,BOOK XVIII.,the steadfast goodly Odysseus mused in himself whether he should smite
9766,BOOK XVIII.,"him in such wise that his life should leave his body, even there where"
9767,BOOK XVIII.,"he fell, or whether he should strike him lightly, and stretch him on"
9768,BOOK XVIII.,"the earth. And as he thought thereon, this seemed to him the better"
9769,BOOK XVIII.,"way, to strike lightly, that the Achaeans might not take note of him,"
9770,BOOK XVIII.,"who he was. Then the twain put up their hands, and Irus struck at the"
9771,BOOK XVIII.,"right shoulder, but the other smote him on his neck beneath the ear,"
9772,BOOK XVIII.,"and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red blood gushed up"
9773,BOOK XVIII.,"through his mouth, and with a moan he fell in the dust, and drave"
9774,BOOK XVIII.,together his teeth as he kicked the ground. But the proud wooers threw
9775,BOOK XVIII.,"up their hands, and died outright for laughter. Then Odysseus seized"
9776,BOOK XVIII.,"him by the foot, and dragged him forth through the doorway, till he"
9777,BOOK XVIII.,"came to the courtyard and the gates of the gallery, and he set him down"
9778,BOOK XVIII.,"and rested him against the courtyard wall, and put his staff in his"
9779,BOOK XVIII.,"hands, and uttering his voice spake to him winged words:"
9780,BOOK XVIII.,
9781,BOOK XVIII.,"“Sit thou there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and let not such an"
9782,BOOK XVIII.,"one as thou be lord over strangers and beggars, pitiful as thou art,"
9783,BOOK XVIII.,lest haply some worse thing befal thee.”
9784,BOOK XVIII.,
9785,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus he spake, and cast about his shoulders his mean scrip all"
9786,BOOK XVIII.,"tattered, and the cord therewith to hang it, and he gat him back to the"
9787,BOOK XVIII.,"threshold, and sat him down there again. Now the wooers went within"
9788,BOOK XVIII.,"laughing sweetly, and greeted him, saying:"
9789,BOOK XVIII.,
9790,BOOK XVIII.,"“May Zeus, stranger, and all the other deathless gods give thee thy"
9791,BOOK XVIII.,"dearest wish, even all thy heart’s desire, seeing that thou hast made"
9792,BOOK XVIII.,that insatiate one to cease from his begging in the land! Soon will we
9793,BOOK XVIII.,"take him over to the mainland, to Echetus the king, the maimer of all"
9794,BOOK XVIII.,mankind.”
9795,BOOK XVIII.,
9796,BOOK XVIII.,"So they spake, and goodly Odysseus rejoiced in the omen of the words."
9797,BOOK XVIII.,"And Antinous set by him the great pudding, stuffed with fat and blood,"
9798,BOOK XVIII.,"and Amphinomus took up two loaves from the basket, and set them by him"
9799,BOOK XVIII.,"and pledged him in a golden cup, and spake saying:"
9800,BOOK XVIII.,
9801,BOOK XVIII.,"“Father and stranger, hail! may happiness be thine in the time to come;"
9802,BOOK XVIII.,"but as now, thou art fast holden in many sorrows.”"
9803,BOOK XVIII.,
9804,BOOK XVIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Amphinomus, verily"
9805,BOOK XVIII.,thou seemest to me a prudent man enough; for such too was the father of
9806,BOOK XVIII.,"whom thou art sprung, for I have heard the fair fame of him, how that"
9807,BOOK XVIII.,"Nisus of Dulichium was a good man and a rich, and his son they say thou"
9808,BOOK XVIII.,"art, and thou seemest a man of understanding. Wherefore I will tell"
9809,BOOK XVIII.,"thee, and do thou mark and listen to me. Nought feebler doth the earth"
9810,BOOK XVIII.,"nurture than man, of all the creatures that breathe and move upon the"
9811,BOOK XVIII.,"face of the earth. Lo, he thinks that he shall never suffer evil in"
9812,BOOK XVIII.,"time to come, while the gods give him happiness, and his limbs move"
9813,BOOK XVIII.,"lightly. But when again the blessed gods have wrought for him sorrow,"
9814,BOOK XVIII.,"even so he bears it, as he must, with a steadfast heart. For the spirit"
9815,BOOK XVIII.,"of men upon the earth is even as their day, that comes upon them from"
9816,BOOK XVIII.,"the father of gods and men. Yea, and I too once was like to have been"
9817,BOOK XVIII.,"prosperous among men, but many an infatuate deed I did, giving place to"
9818,BOOK XVIII.,"mine own hardihood and strength, and trusting to my father and my"
9819,BOOK XVIII.,"brethren. Wherefore let no man for ever be lawless any more, but keep"
9820,BOOK XVIII.,"quietly the gifts of the gods, whatsoever they may give. Such infatuate"
9821,BOOK XVIII.,"deeds do I see the wooers devising, as they waste the wealth, and hold"
9822,BOOK XVIII.,"in no regard the wife of a man, who, methinks, will not much longer be"
9823,BOOK XVIII.,far from his friends and his own land; nay he is very near. But for
9824,BOOK XVIII.,"thee, may some god withdraw thee hence to thy home, and mayst thou not"
9825,BOOK XVIII.,meet him in the day when he returns to his own dear country! For not
9826,BOOK XVIII.,"without blood, as I deem, will they be sundered, the wooers and"
9827,BOOK XVIII.,"Odysseus, when once he shall have come beneath his own roof.”"
9828,BOOK XVIII.,
9829,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus he spake, and poured an offering and then drank of the honey-sweet"
9830,BOOK XVIII.,"wine, and again set the cup in the hands of the arrayer of the people."
9831,BOOK XVIII.,"But the other went back through the hall, sad at heart and bowing his"
9832,BOOK XVIII.,head; for verily his soul boded evil. Yet even so he avoided not his
9833,BOOK XVIII.,"fate, for Athene had bound him likewise to be slain outright at the"
9834,BOOK XVIII.,hands and by the spear of Telemachus. So he sat down again on the high
9835,BOOK XVIII.,seat whence he had arisen.
9836,BOOK XVIII.,
9837,BOOK XVIII.,"Now the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put it into the heart of the"
9838,BOOK XVIII.,"daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to show herself to the wooers, that"
9839,BOOK XVIII.,"she might make their heart all flutter with hope, and that she might"
9840,BOOK XVIII.,win yet more worship from her lord and her son than heretofore. To she
9841,BOOK XVIII.,"laughed an idle laugh, and spake to the nurse, and hailed her, saying:"
9842,BOOK XVIII.,
9843,BOOK XVIII.,"“Eurynome, my heart yearns, though before I had no such desire, to show"
9844,BOOK XVIII.,"myself to the wooers, hateful as they are. I would also say a word to"
9845,BOOK XVIII.,"my son, that will be for his weal, namely, that he should not for ever"
9846,BOOK XVIII.,"consort with the proud wooers, who speak friendly with their lips, but"
9847,BOOK XVIII.,imagine evil in the latter end.”
9848,BOOK XVIII.,
9849,BOOK XVIII.,"Then the housewife, Eurynome, spake to her saying: “Yea my child, all"
9850,BOOK XVIII.,"this thou hast spoken as is meet. Go then, and declare thy word to thy"
9851,BOOK XVIII.,"son and hide it not, but first wash thee and anoint thy face, and go"
9852,BOOK XVIII.,"not as thou art with thy cheeks all stained with tears. Go, for it is"
9853,BOOK XVIII.,"little good to sorrow always, and never cease. And lo, thy son is now"
9854,BOOK XVIII.,"of an age to hear thee, he whom thou hast above all things prayed the"
9855,BOOK XVIII.,gods that thou mightest see with a beard upon his chin.”
9856,BOOK XVIII.,
9857,BOOK XVIII.,"Then wise Penelope answered her, saying: “Eurynome, speak not thus"
9858,BOOK XVIII.,"comfortably to me, for all thy love, bidding me to wash and be anointed"
9859,BOOK XVIII.,"with ointment. For the gods that keep Olympus destroyed my bloom, since"
9860,BOOK XVIII.,the day that he departed in the hollow ships. But bid Autonoe and
9861,BOOK XVIII.,"Hippodameia come to me, to stand by my side in the halls. Alone I will"
9862,BOOK XVIII.,"not go among men, for I am ashamed.”"
9863,BOOK XVIII.,
9864,BOOK XVIII.,"So she spake, and the old woman passed through the chamber to tell the"
9865,BOOK XVIII.,"maidens, and hasten their coming."
9866,BOOK XVIII.,
9867,BOOK XVIII.,"Thereon the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought. She shed a"
9868,BOOK XVIII.,"sweet slumber over the daughter of Icarius, who sank back in sleep, and"
9869,BOOK XVIII.,"all her joints were loosened as she lay in the chair, and the fair"
9870,BOOK XVIII.,"goddess the while was giving her gifts immortal, that all the Achaeans"
9871,BOOK XVIII.,might marvel at her. Her fair face first she steeped with beauty
9872,BOOK XVIII.,"imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea is anointed,"
9873,BOOK XVIII.,when she goes to the lovely dances of the Graces. And she made her
9874,BOOK XVIII.,"taller and greater to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory."
9875,BOOK XVIII.,"Now when she had wrought thus, that fair goddess departed, and the"
9876,BOOK XVIII.,white-armed handmaidens came forth from the chamber and drew nigh with
9877,BOOK XVIII.,"a sound of voices. Then sweet sleep left hold of Penelope, and she"
9878,BOOK XVIII.,"rubbed her cheeks with her hands, and said:"
9879,BOOK XVIII.,
9880,BOOK XVIII.,"“Surely soft slumber wrapped me round, most wretched though I be. Oh!"
9881,BOOK XVIII.,"that pure Artemis would give me so soft a death even now, that I might"
9882,BOOK XVIII.,"no more waste my life in sorrow of heart, and longing for the manifold"
9883,BOOK XVIII.,"excellence of my dear lord, for that he was foremost of the Achaeans.”"
9884,BOOK XVIII.,
9885,BOOK XVIII.,"With this word she went down from the shining upper chamber, not alone,"
9886,BOOK XVIII.,for two handmaidens likewise bare her company. But when the fair lady
9887,BOOK XVIII.,"had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded"
9888,BOOK XVIII.,"roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side"
9889,BOOK XVIII.,of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
9890,BOOK XVIII.,"wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and"
9891,BOOK XVIII.,each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
9892,BOOK XVIII.,"spake to Telemachus, her dear son:"
9893,BOOK XVIII.,
9894,BOOK XVIII.,"“Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they"
9895,BOOK XVIII.,"were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more"
9896,BOOK XVIII.,"crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the"
9897,BOOK XVIII.,"measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy"
9898,BOOK XVIII.,"beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and"
9899,BOOK XVIII.,"thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed"
9900,BOOK XVIII.,"has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to"
9901,BOOK XVIII.,"be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger"
9902,BOOK XVIII.,"sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this"
9903,BOOK XVIII.,evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.”
9904,BOOK XVIII.,
9905,BOOK XVIII.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I"
9906,BOOK XVIII.,count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
9907,BOOK XVIII.,"understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but"
9908,BOOK XVIII.,heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
9909,BOOK XVIII.,"to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,"
9910,BOOK XVIII.,"on this side and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this"
9911,BOOK XVIII.,battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as the wooers
9912,BOOK XVIII.,"would have had it, but the stranger proved the better man. Would to"
9913,BOOK XVIII.,"Father Zeus and Athene and Apollo, that the wooers in our halls were"
9914,BOOK XVIII.,"even now thus vanquished, and wagging their heads, some in the court,"
9915,BOOK XVIII.,"and some within the house, and that the limbs of each man were loosened"
9916,BOOK XVIII.,"in such fashion as Irus yonder sits now, by the courtyard gates wagging"
9917,BOOK XVIII.,"his head, like a drunken man, and cannot stand upright on his feet, nor"
9918,BOOK XVIII.,"yet get him home to his own place, seeing that his limbs are loosened!”"
9919,BOOK XVIII.,
9920,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus they spake one to another. But Eurymachus spake to Penelope,"
9921,BOOK XVIII.,saying:
9922,BOOK XVIII.,
9923,BOOK XVIII.,"“Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, if all the Achaeans in Iasian"
9924,BOOK XVIII.,"Argos could behold thee, even a greater press of wooers would feast in"
9925,BOOK XVIII.,"your halls from to-morrow’s dawn, since thou dost surpass all women in"
9926,BOOK XVIII.,"beauty and stature, and within in wisdom of mind.”"
9927,BOOK XVIII.,
9928,BOOK XVIII.,"Then wise Penelope answered him: “Eurymachus, surely my excellence,"
9929,BOOK XVIII.,"both of face and form, the gods destroyed in the day when the Argives"
9930,BOOK XVIII.,"embarked for Ilios, and with them went my lord Odysseus. If but he"
9931,BOOK XVIII.,"might come and watch over this my life, greater thus would be my fame"
9932,BOOK XVIII.,and fairer! But now am I in sorrow; such a host of ills some god has
9933,BOOK XVIII.,"sent against me. Ah, well do I remember, when he set forth and left his"
9934,BOOK XVIII.,"own country, how he took me by the right hand at the wrist and spake,"
9935,BOOK XVIII.,saying:
9936,BOOK XVIII.,
9937,BOOK XVIII.,"“‘Lady, methinks that all the goodly-greaved Achaeans will not win a"
9938,BOOK XVIII.,"safe return from Troy; for the Trojans too, they say, are good men at"
9939,BOOK XVIII.,"arms, as spearsmen, and bowmen, and drivers of fleet horses, such as"
9940,BOOK XVIII.,ever most swiftly determine the great strife of equal battle. Wherefore
9941,BOOK XVIII.,"I know not if the gods will suffer me to return, or whether I shall be"
9942,BOOK XVIII.,cut off there in Troy; so do thou have a care for all these things. Be
9943,BOOK XVIII.,"mindful of my father and my mother in the halls, even as now thou art,"
9944,BOOK XVIII.,"or yet more than now, while I am far away. But when thou seest thy son"
9945,BOOK XVIII.,"a bearded man, marry whom thou wilt and leave thine own house.’"
9946,BOOK XVIII.,
9947,BOOK XVIII.,"“Even so did he speak, and now all these things have an end. The night"
9948,BOOK XVIII.,"shall come when a hateful marriage shall find me out, me most luckless,"
9949,BOOK XVIII.,whose good hap Zeus has taken away. But furthermore this sore trouble
9950,BOOK XVIII.,has come on my heart and soul; for this was not the manner of wooers in
9951,BOOK XVIII.,time past. Whoso wish to woo a good lady and the daughter of a rich
9952,BOOK XVIII.,"man, and vie one with another, themselves bring with them oxen of their"
9953,BOOK XVIII.,"own and goodly flocks, a banquet for the friends of the bride, and they"
9954,BOOK XVIII.,"give the lady splendid gifts, but do not devour another’s livelihood"
9955,BOOK XVIII.,without atonement.”
9956,BOOK XVIII.,
9957,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced because she"
9958,BOOK XVIII.,"drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls with soothing words,"
9959,BOOK XVIII.,while her heart was set on other things.
9960,BOOK XVIII.,
9961,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered her again: “Daughter of"
9962,BOOK XVIII.,"Icarius, wise Penelope, the gifts which any of the Achaeans may choose"
9963,BOOK XVIII.,"to bring hither, do thou take; for it were ill to withhold a gift. But"
9964,BOOK XVIII.,"we for our part will neither go to our lands nor otherwhere, before"
9965,BOOK XVIII.,thou art wedded to the best man of the Achaeans.”
9966,BOOK XVIII.,
9967,BOOK XVIII.,"So spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well, and each man sent"
9968,BOOK XVIII.,a henchman to bring his gifts. For Antinous his henchman bare a
9969,BOOK XVIII.,"broidered robe, great and very fair, wherein were golden brooches,"
9970,BOOK XVIII.,"twelve in all, fitted with well bent clasps. And the henchman"
9971,BOOK XVIII.,"straightway bare Eurymachus a golden chain of curious work, strung with"
9972,BOOK XVIII.,"amber beads, shining like the sun. And his squires bare for Eurydamas a"
9973,BOOK XVIII.,"pair of ear-rings, with three drops well wrought, and much grace shone"
9974,BOOK XVIII.,"from them. And out of the house of Peisander the prince, the son of"
9975,BOOK XVIII.,"Polyctor, the squire brought a necklet, a very lovely jewel. And"
9976,BOOK XVIII.,likewise the Achaeans brought each one some other beautiful gift.
9977,BOOK XVIII.,
9978,BOOK XVIII.,"Then the fair lady went aloft to her upper chamber, and her attendant"
9979,BOOK XVIII.,"maidens bare for her the lovely gifts, while the wooers turned to"
9980,BOOK XVIII.,"dancing and the delight of song, and therein took their pleasure, and"
9981,BOOK XVIII.,awaited the coming of eventide. And dark evening came on them at their
9982,BOOK XVIII.,"pastime. Anon they set up three braziers in the halls, to give them"
9983,BOOK XVIII.,"light, and on these they laid firewood all around, faggots seasoned"
9984,BOOK XVIII.,"long since and sere, and new split with the axe. And midway by the"
9985,BOOK XVIII.,"braziers they placed torches, and the maids of Odysseus, of the hardy"
9986,BOOK XVIII.,"heart, held up the lights in turn. Then the prince Odysseus of many"
9987,BOOK XVIII.,counsels himself spake among them saying:
9988,BOOK XVIII.,
9989,BOOK XVIII.,"“Ye maidens of Odysseus, the lord so long afar, get ye into the"
9990,BOOK XVIII.,"chambers where the honoured queen abides, and twist the yarn at her"
9991,BOOK XVIII.,"side, and gladden her heart as ye sit in the chamber, or card the wools"
9992,BOOK XVIII.,with your hands; but I will minister light to all these that are here.
9993,BOOK XVIII.,"For even if they are minded to wait the throned Dawn, they shall not"
9994,BOOK XVIII.,"outstay me, so long enduring am I.”"
9995,BOOK XVIII.,
9996,BOOK XVIII.,"So he spake, but they laughed and looked one at the other. And the fair"
9997,BOOK XVIII.,"Melantho chid him shamefully, Melantho that Dolius begat, but Penelope"
9998,BOOK XVIII.,"reared, and entreated her tenderly as she had been her own child, and"
9999,BOOK XVIII.,"gave her playthings to her heart’s desire. Yet, for all that, sorrow"
10000,BOOK XVIII.,"for Penelope touched not her heart, but she loved Eurymachus and was"
10001,BOOK XVIII.,his paramour. Now she chid Odysseus with railing words:
10002,BOOK XVIII.,
10003,BOOK XVIII.,"“Wretched guest, surely thou art some brain-struck man, seeing that"
10004,BOOK XVIII.,"thou dost not choose to go and sleep at a smithy, or at some place of"
10005,BOOK XVIII.,"common resort, but here thou pratest much and boldly among many lords"
10006,BOOK XVIII.,"and hast no fear at heart. Verily wine has got about thy wits, or"
10007,BOOK XVIII.,"perchance thou art always of this mind, and so thou dost babble idly."
10008,BOOK XVIII.,"Art thou beside thyself for joy, because thou hast beaten the beggar"
10009,BOOK XVIII.,Irus? Take heed lest a better man than Irus rise up presently against
10010,BOOK XVIII.,"thee, to lay his mighty hands about thy head and bedabble thee with"
10011,BOOK XVIII.,"blood, and send thee hence from the house.”"
10012,BOOK XVIII.,
10013,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Yea,"
10014,BOOK XVIII.,"straight will I go yonder and tell Telemachus hereof, thou shameless"
10015,BOOK XVIII.,"thing, for this thy speech, that forthwith he may cut thee limb from"
10016,BOOK XVIII.,limb.”
10017,BOOK XVIII.,
10018,BOOK XVIII.,"So he spake, and with his saying scared away the women, who fled"
10019,BOOK XVIII.,"through the hall, and the knees of each were loosened for fear, for"
10020,BOOK XVIII.,they deemed that his words were true. But Odysseus took his stand by
10021,BOOK XVIII.,"the burning braziers, tending the lights, and gazed on all the men: but"
10022,BOOK XVIII.,"far other matters he pondered in his heart, things not to be"
10023,BOOK XVIII.,unfulfilled.
10024,BOOK XVIII.,
10025,BOOK XVIII.,Now Athene would in no wise suffer the lordly wooers to abstain from
10026,BOOK XVIII.,"biting scorn, that the pain might sink yet the deeper into the heart of"
10027,BOOK XVIII.,"Odysseus, son of Laertes. So Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak"
10028,BOOK XVIII.,"among them, girding at Odysseus, and so made mirth for his friends:"
10029,BOOK XVIII.,
10030,BOOK XVIII.,"“Hear me ye wooers of the queen renowned, that I may say that which my"
10031,BOOK XVIII.,spirit within me bids me. Not without the gods’ will has this man come
10032,BOOK XVIII.,to the house of Odysseus; methinks at least that the torchlight flares
10033,BOOK XVIII.,"forth from[33] that head of his, for there are no hairs on it, nay"
10034,BOOK XVIII.,never so thin.”
10035,BOOK XVIII.,
10036,BOOK XVIII.,[33] Accepting the conjecture κὰκ = κατὰ for the MSS. καὶ.
10037,BOOK XVIII.,
10038,BOOK XVIII.,
10039,BOOK XVIII.,"He spake and withal addressed Odysseus, waster of cities: “Stranger,"
10040,BOOK XVIII.,"wouldest thou indeed be my hireling, if I would take thee for my man,"
10041,BOOK XVIII.,"at an upland farm, and thy wages shall be assured thee, and there shalt"
10042,BOOK XVIII.,thou gather stones for walls and plant tall trees? There would I
10043,BOOK XVIII.,"provide thee bread continual, and clothe thee with raiment, and give"
10044,BOOK XVIII.,"thee shoes for thy feet. Howbeit, since thou art practised only in"
10045,BOOK XVIII.,"evil, thou wilt not care to go to the labours of the field, but wilt"
10046,BOOK XVIII.,"choose rather to go louting through the land, that thou mayst have"
10047,BOOK XVIII.,wherewithal to feed thine insatiate belly.”
10048,BOOK XVIII.,
10049,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: “Eurymachus,"
10050,BOOK XVIII.,"would that there might be a trial of labour between us twain, in the"
10051,BOOK XVIII.,"season of spring, when the long days begin! In the deep grass might it"
10052,BOOK XVIII.,"be, and I should have a crooked scythe, and thou another like it, that"
10053,BOOK XVIII.,"we might try each the other in the matter of labour, fasting till late"
10054,BOOK XVIII.,"eventide, and grass there should be in plenty. Or would again, that"
10055,BOOK XVIII.,"there were oxen to drive, the best there may be, large and tawny, both"
10056,BOOK XVIII.,"well filled with fodder, of equal age and force to bear the yoke and of"
10057,BOOK XVIII.,"strength untiring! And it should be a field of four ploughgates, and"
10058,BOOK XVIII.,the clod should yield before the ploughshare. Then shouldest thou see
10059,BOOK XVIII.,"me, whether or no I would cut a clean furrow unbroken before me. Or"
10060,BOOK XVIII.,"would that this very day Cronion might waken war whence he would, and"
10061,BOOK XVIII.,"that I had a shield and two spears, and a helmet all of bronze, close"
10062,BOOK XVIII.,fitting on my temples! Then shouldest thou see me mingling in the
10063,BOOK XVIII.,"forefront of the battle, nor speak and taunt me with this my belly."
10064,BOOK XVIII.,"Nay, thou art exceeding wanton and thy heart is hard, and thou thinkest"
10065,BOOK XVIII.,"thyself some great one and mighty, because thou consortest with few men"
10066,BOOK XVIII.,"and feeble. Ah, if Odysseus might but return and come to his own"
10067,BOOK XVIII.,"country, right soon would yonder doors full wide as they are, prove all"
10068,BOOK XVIII.,too strait for thee in thy flight through the doorway!”
10069,BOOK XVIII.,
10070,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus he spake, and Eurymachus waxed yet the more wroth at heart, and"
10071,BOOK XVIII.,looking fiercely on him spake to him winged words:
10072,BOOK XVIII.,
10073,BOOK XVIII.,"“Ah, wretch that thou art, right soon will I work thee mischief, so"
10074,BOOK XVIII.,"boldly thou pratest among many lords, and hast no fear at heart. Verily"
10075,BOOK XVIII.,"wine has got about thy wits, or perchance thou art always of this mind,"
10076,BOOK XVIII.,"and so thou dost babble idly. Art thou beside thyself for joy, because"
10077,BOOK XVIII.,thou hast beaten the beggar Irus?”
10078,BOOK XVIII.,
10079,BOOK XVIII.,"Therewith he caught up a footstool, but Odysseus sat him down at the"
10080,BOOK XVIII.,"knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, in dread of Eurymachus. And"
10081,BOOK XVIII.,"Eurymachus cast and smote the cup-bearer on the right hand, and the"
10082,BOOK XVIII.,"ladle cup dropped to the ground with a clang, while the young man"
10083,BOOK XVIII.,groaned and fell backwards in the dust. Then the wooers clamoured
10084,BOOK XVIII.,"through the shadowy halls, and thus one would say looking to his"
10085,BOOK XVIII.,neighbour:
10086,BOOK XVIII.,
10087,BOOK XVIII.,"“Would that our wandering guest had perished otherwhere, or ever he"
10088,BOOK XVIII.,came hither; so should he never have made all this tumult in our midst!
10089,BOOK XVIII.,"But now we are all at strife about beggars, and there will be no more"
10090,BOOK XVIII.,"joy of the good feast, for worse things have their way.”"
10091,BOOK XVIII.,
10092,BOOK XVIII.,Then the mighty prince Telemachus spake among them:
10093,BOOK XVIII.,
10094,BOOK XVIII.,"“Sirs, ye are mad; now doth your mood betray that ye have eaten and"
10095,BOOK XVIII.,"drunken; some one of the gods is surely moving you. Nay, now that ye"
10096,BOOK XVIII.,"have feasted well, go home and lay you to rest, since your spirit so"
10097,BOOK XVIII.,"bids; for as for me, I drive no man hence.”"
10098,BOOK XVIII.,
10099,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus he spake, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus,"
10100,BOOK XVIII.,"in that he spake boldly. Then Amphinomus made harangue, and spake among"
10101,BOOK XVIII.,"them, Amphinomus, the famous son of Nisus the prince, the son of"
10102,BOOK XVIII.,Aretias:
10103,BOOK XVIII.,
10104,BOOK XVIII.,"“Friends, when a righteous word has been spoken, none surely would"
10105,BOOK XVIII.,rebuke another with hard speech and be angry. Misuse ye not this
10106,BOOK XVIII.,"stranger, neither any of the thralls that are in the house of godlike"
10107,BOOK XVIII.,"Odysseus. But come, let the wine-bearer pour for libation into each cup"
10108,BOOK XVIII.,"in turn, that after the drink-offering we may get us home to bed. But"
10109,BOOK XVIII.,the stranger let us leave in the halls of Odysseus for a charge to
10110,BOOK XVIII.,Telemachus: for to his home has he come.”
10111,BOOK XVIII.,
10112,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus he spake, and his word was well-pleasing to them all. Then the"
10113,BOOK XVIII.,"lord Mulius mixed for them the bowl, the henchman out of Dulichium, who"
10114,BOOK XVIII.,was squire of Amphinomus. And he stood by all and served it to them in
10115,BOOK XVIII.,"their turn; and they poured forth before the blessed gods, and drank"
10116,BOOK XVIII.,the honey-sweet wine. Now when they had poured forth and had drunken to
10117,BOOK XVIII.,"their hearts’ content, they departed to lie down, each one to his own"
10118,BOOK XVIII.,house.
10119,BOOK XVIII.,
10120,BOOK XVIII.,
10121,BOOK XVIII.,
10122,BOOK XIX.,BOOK XIX.
10123,BOOK XIX.,
10124,BOOK XIX.,
10125,BOOK XIX.,Telemachus removes the arms out of the hall. Odysseus disburseth with
10126,BOOK XIX.,"Penelope. And is known by his nurse, but concealed. And the hunting of"
10127,BOOK XIX.,the boar upon that occasion related.
10128,BOOK XIX.,
10129,BOOK XIX.,
10130,BOOK XIX.,"Now the goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, devising with"
10131,BOOK XIX.,"Athene’s aid the slaying of the wooers, and straightway he spake winged"
10132,BOOK XIX.,words to Telemachus:
10133,BOOK XIX.,
10134,BOOK XIX.,"“Telemachus, we must needs lay by the weapons of war within, every one;"
10135,BOOK XIX.,"and when the wooers miss them and ask thee concerning them, thou shalt"
10136,BOOK XIX.,"beguile them with soft words, saying:"
10137,BOOK XIX.,
10138,BOOK XIX.,"“Out of the smoke I laid them by, since they were no longer like those"
10139,BOOK XIX.,"that Odysseus left behind him of old, when he went to Troy, but they"
10140,BOOK XIX.,"are wholly marred, so mightily hath passed upon them the vapour of"
10141,BOOK XIX.,fire. Moreover some god hath put into my heart this other and greater
10142,BOOK XIX.,"care, that perchance when ye are heated with wine, ye set a quarrel"
10143,BOOK XIX.,"between you and wound one the other, and thereby shame the feast and"
10144,BOOK XIX.,the wooing; for iron of itself draws a man thereto.”
10145,BOOK XIX.,
10146,BOOK XIX.,"Thus he spake, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and called"
10147,BOOK XIX.,"forth to him the nurse Eurycleia and spake to her, saying:"
10148,BOOK XIX.,
10149,BOOK XIX.,"“Nurse, come now I pray thee, shut up the women in their chambers till"
10150,BOOK XIX.,"I shall have laid by in the armoury the goodly weapons of my father,"
10151,BOOK XIX.,"which all uncared for the smoke dims in the hall, since my father went"
10152,BOOK XIX.,"hence, and I was still but a child. Now I wish to lay them by where the"
10153,BOOK XIX.,vapour of the fire will not reach them.”
10154,BOOK XIX.,
10155,BOOK XIX.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered him, saying: “Ah, my child, if"
10156,BOOK XIX.,ever thou wouldest but take careful thought in such wise as to mind the
10157,BOOK XIX.,"house, and guard all this wealth! But come, who shall fetch the light"
10158,BOOK XIX.,"and bear it, if thou hast thy way, since thou wouldest not that the"
10159,BOOK XIX.,"maidens, who might have given light, should go before thee?”"
10160,BOOK XIX.,
10161,BOOK XIX.,"Then wise Telemachus made answer to her: “This stranger here, for I"
10162,BOOK XIX.,"will keep no man in idleness who eats of my bread, even if he have come"
10163,BOOK XIX.,from afar.”
10164,BOOK XIX.,
10165,BOOK XIX.,"Thus he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she closed the"
10166,BOOK XIX.,"doors of the fair-lying chambers. Then they twain sprang up, Odysseus"
10167,BOOK XIX.,"and his renowned son, and set to carry within the helmets and the bossy"
10168,BOOK XIX.,"shields, and the sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athene"
10169,BOOK XIX.,bare a golden cresset and cast a most lovely light. Thereon Telemachus
10170,BOOK XIX.,spake to his father suddenly:
10171,BOOK XIX.,
10172,BOOK XIX.,"“Father, surely a great marvel is this that I behold with mine eyes;"
10173,BOOK XIX.,"meseems, at least, that the walls of the hall and the fair main-beams"
10174,BOOK XIX.,"of the roof and the cross-beams of pine, and the pillars that run"
10175,BOOK XIX.,"aloft, are bright as it were with flaming fire. Verily some god is"
10176,BOOK XIX.,"within, of those that hold the wide heaven.”"
10177,BOOK XIX.,
10178,BOOK XIX.,And Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: “Hold thy peace
10179,BOOK XIX.,"and keep thy thoughts in check and ask not hereof. Lo, this is the wont"
10180,BOOK XIX.,"of the gods that hold Olympus. But do thou go and lay thee down, and I"
10181,BOOK XIX.,"will abide here, that I may yet further provoke the maids and thy"
10182,BOOK XIX.,mother to answer; and she in her sorrow will ask me concerning each
10183,BOOK XIX.,"thing, one by one.”"
10184,BOOK XIX.,
10185,BOOK XIX.,"So he spake, and Telemachus passed out through the hall to his chamber"
10186,BOOK XIX.,"to lie down, by the light of the flaming torches, even to the chamber"
10187,BOOK XIX.,"where of old he took his rest, when sweet sleep came over him. There"
10188,BOOK XIX.,now too he lay down and awaited the bright Dawn. But goodly Odysseus
10189,BOOK XIX.,"was left behind in the hall, devising with Athene’s aid the slaying of"
10190,BOOK XIX.,the wooers.
10191,BOOK XIX.,
10192,BOOK XIX.,"Now forth from her chamber came the wise Penelope, like Artemis or"
10193,BOOK XIX.,"golden Aphrodite, and they set a chair for her hard by before the fire,"
10194,BOOK XIX.,"where she was wont to sit, a chair well-wrought and inlaid with ivory"
10195,BOOK XIX.,"and silver, which on a time the craftsman Icmalius had fashioned, and"
10196,BOOK XIX.,"had joined thereto a footstool, that was part of the chair, whereon a"
10197,BOOK XIX.,"great fleece was used to be laid. Here then, the wise Penelope sat her"
10198,BOOK XIX.,"down, and next came white-armed handmaids from the women’s chamber, and"
10199,BOOK XIX.,"began to take away the many fragments of food, and the tables and the"
10200,BOOK XIX.,"cups whence the proud lords had been drinking, and they raked out the"
10201,BOOK XIX.,"fire from the braziers on to the floor, and piled many fresh logs upon"
10202,BOOK XIX.,"them, to give light and warmth."
10203,BOOK XIX.,
10204,BOOK XIX.,"Then Melantho began to revile Odysseus yet a second time, saying:"
10205,BOOK XIX.,"“Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here, circling round the"
10206,BOOK XIX.,"house in the night, and spying the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou"
10207,BOOK XIX.,"wretched thing, and be thankful for thy supper, or straightway shalt"
10208,BOOK XIX.,thou even be smitten with a torch and so fare out of the doors.”
10209,BOOK XIX.,
10210,BOOK XIX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Good"
10211,BOOK XIX.,"woman, what possesses thee to assail me thus out of an angry heart? Is"
10212,BOOK XIX.,"it because I go filthy and am clothed about in sorry raiment, and beg"
10213,BOOK XIX.,"through the land, for necessity is laid on me? This is the manner of"
10214,BOOK XIX.,beggars and of wandering men. For I too once had a house of mine own
10215,BOOK XIX.,"among men, a rich man with a wealthy house, and many a time would I"
10216,BOOK XIX.,"give to a wanderer, what manner of man soever he might be, and in"
10217,BOOK XIX.,"whatsoever need he came. And I had countless thralls, and all else in"
10218,BOOK XIX.,"plenty, whereby folk live well and have a name for riches. But Zeus,"
10219,BOOK XIX.,"the son of Cronos, made me desolate of all, for surely it was his will."
10220,BOOK XIX.,"Wherefore, woman, see lest some day thou too lose all thy fine show"
10221,BOOK XIX.,"wherein thou now excellest among the handmaids, as well may chance, if"
10222,BOOK XIX.,"thy mistress be provoked to anger with thee, or if Odysseus come home,"
10223,BOOK XIX.,for there is yet a place for hope. And even if he hath perished as ye
10224,BOOK XIX.,"deem, and is never more to return, yet by Apollo’s grace he hath a son"
10225,BOOK XIX.,"like him, Telemachus, and none of the women works wantonness in his"
10226,BOOK XIX.,"halls without his knowledge, for he is no longer of an age not to mark"
10227,BOOK XIX.,"it,"
10228,BOOK XIX.,
10229,BOOK XIX.,"Thus he spake, and the wise Penelope heard him, and rebuked the"
10230,BOOK XIX.,"handmaid, and spake and hailed her:"
10231,BOOK XIX.,
10232,BOOK XIX.,"“Thou reckless thing and unabashed, be sure thy great sin is not hidden"
10233,BOOK XIX.,"from me, and thy blood shall be on thine own head for the same! Four"
10234,BOOK XIX.,"thou knewest right well, in that thou hadst heard it from my lips, how"
10235,BOOK XIX.,that I was minded to ask the stranger in my halls for tidings of my
10236,BOOK XIX.,lord; for I am grievously afflicted.”
10237,BOOK XIX.,
10238,BOOK XIX.,"Therewith she spake likewise to the housedame, Eurynome, saying:"
10239,BOOK XIX.,
10240,BOOK XIX.,"“Eurynome, bring hither a settle with a fleece thereon, that the"
10241,BOOK XIX.,"stranger may sit and speak with me and hear my words, for I would ask"
10242,BOOK XIX.,him all his story.”
10243,BOOK XIX.,
10244,BOOK XIX.,"So she spake, and the nurse made haste and brought a polished settle,"
10245,BOOK XIX.,and cast a fleece thereon; and then the steadfast goodly Odysseus sat
10246,BOOK XIX.,"him down there, and the wise Penelope spake first, saying:"
10247,BOOK XIX.,
10248,BOOK XIX.,"“Stranger, I will make bold first to ask thee this: who art thou of the"
10249,BOOK XIX.,"sons of men, and whence? Where is thy city, and where are they that"
10250,BOOK XIX.,begat thee?”
10251,BOOK XIX.,
10252,BOOK XIX.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: “Lady, no one of"
10253,BOOK XIX.,"mortal men in the wide world could find fault with thee, for lo, thy"
10254,BOOK XIX.,"fame goes up to the wide heaven, as doth the fame of a blameless king,"
10255,BOOK XIX.,"one that fears the gods and reigns among many men and mighty,"
10256,BOOK XIX.,"maintaining right, and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the"
10257,BOOK XIX.,"trees are laden with fruit, and the sheep bring forth and fail not, and"
10258,BOOK XIX.,"the sea gives store of fish, and all out of his good guidance, and the"
10259,BOOK XIX.,people prosper under him. Wherefore do thou ask me now in thy house all
10260,BOOK XIX.,"else that thou wilt, but inquire not concerning my race and mine own"
10261,BOOK XIX.,"country, lest as I think thereupon thou fill my heart the more with"
10262,BOOK XIX.,"pains, for I am a man of many sorrows. Moreover it beseems me not to"
10263,BOOK XIX.,"sit weeping and wailing in another’s house, for it is little good to"
10264,BOOK XIX.,"mourn always without ceasing, lest perchance one of the maidens, or"
10265,BOOK XIX.,"even thyself, be angry with me and say that I swim in tears, as one"
10266,BOOK XIX.,that is heavy with wine.”
10267,BOOK XIX.,
10268,BOOK XIX.,"Then wise Penelope answered him, and said: “Stranger, surely my"
10269,BOOK XIX.,"excellence, both of face and form, the gods destroyed, in the day when"
10270,BOOK XIX.,"the Argives embarked for Ilios, and with them went my lord Odysseus. If"
10271,BOOK XIX.,"but he might come and watch over this my life, greater and fairer thus"
10272,BOOK XIX.,"would be my fame! But now am I in sorrow, such a host of ills some god"
10273,BOOK XIX.,"has sent against me. For all the noblest that are princes in the isles,"
10274,BOOK XIX.,"in Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus, and they that dwell around"
10275,BOOK XIX.,"even in clear-seen Ithaca, these are wooing me against my will, and"
10276,BOOK XIX.,"devouring the house. Wherefore I take no heed of strangers, nor"
10277,BOOK XIX.,"suppliants, nor at all of heralds, the craftsmen of the people. But I"
10278,BOOK XIX.,waste my heart away in longing for Odysseus; so they speed on my
10279,BOOK XIX.,marriage and I weave a web of wiles. First some god put it into my
10280,BOOK XIX.,"heart to set up a great web in the halls, and thereat to weave a robe"
10281,BOOK XIX.,"fine of woof and very wide; and anon I spake among them, saying: ‘Ye"
10282,BOOK XIX.,"princely youths, my wooers, now that goodly Odysseus is dead, do ye"
10283,BOOK XIX.,"abide patiently, how eager soever to speed on this marriage of mine,"
10284,BOOK XIX.,till I finish the robe. I would not that the threads perish to no
10285,BOOK XIX.,"avail, even this shroud for the hero Laertes, against the day when the"
10286,BOOK XIX.,"ruinous doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at their"
10287,BOOK XIX.,length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land count it blame
10288,BOOK XIX.,"in me, as well might be, were he to lie without a winding sheet, a man"
10289,BOOK XIX.,that had gotten great possessions.’
10290,BOOK XIX.,
10291,BOOK XIX.,"“So spake I, and their high hearts consented thereto. So then in the"
10292,BOOK XIX.,"daytime I would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the"
10293,BOOK XIX.,"same, when I had let place the torches by me. Thus for the space of"
10294,BOOK XIX.,three years I hid the thing by craft and beguiled the minds of the
10295,BOOK XIX.,"Achaeans. But when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round"
10296,BOOK XIX.,"as the months waned, and many days were accomplished, then it was that"
10297,BOOK XIX.,"by help of the handmaids, shameless things and reckless, the wooers"
10298,BOOK XIX.,"came and trapped me, and chid me loudly. Thus did I finish the web by"
10299,BOOK XIX.,"no will of mine, for so I must. And now I can neither escape the"
10300,BOOK XIX.,"marriage nor devise any further counsel, and my parents are instant"
10301,BOOK XIX.,"with me to marry, and my son chafes that these men devour his"
10302,BOOK XIX.,"livelihood, as he takes note of all; for by this time he has come to"
10303,BOOK XIX.,"man’s estate; and is full able to care for a household, for one to"
10304,BOOK XIX.,"which Zeus vouchsafes honour. But even so tell me of thine own stock,"
10305,BOOK XIX.,"whence thou art, for thou art not sprung of oak or rock, whereof old"
10306,BOOK XIX.,tales tell.”
10307,BOOK XIX.,
10308,BOOK XIX.,And Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said:
10309,BOOK XIX.,
10310,BOOK XIX.,"“O wife revered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, wilt thou never have done"
10311,BOOK XIX.,"asking me about mine own race? Nay, but I will tell thee: yet surely"
10312,BOOK XIX.,thou wilt give me over to sorrows yet more than those wherein I am
10313,BOOK XIX.,"holden, for so it ever is when a man has been afar from his own"
10314,BOOK XIX.,"country, so long as now I am, wandering in sore pain to many cities of"
10315,BOOK XIX.,mortals. Yet even so I will tell thee what thou askest and inquirest.
10316,BOOK XIX.,"There is a land called Crete in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair"
10317,BOOK XIX.,"land and a rich, begirt with water, and therein are many men"
10318,BOOK XIX.,"innumerable, and ninety cities. And all have not the same speech, but"
10319,BOOK XIX.,there is confusion of tongues; there dwell Achaeans and there too
10320,BOOK XIX.,"Cretans of Crete, high of heart, and Cydonians there and Dorians of"
10321,BOOK XIX.,waving plumes and goodly Pelasgians. And among these cities is the
10322,BOOK XIX.,"mighty city Cnosus, wherein Minos when he was nine years old began to"
10323,BOOK XIX.,"rule, he who held converse with great Zeus, and was the father of my"
10324,BOOK XIX.,"father, even of Deucalion, high of heart. Now Deucalion begat me and"
10325,BOOK XIX.,"Idomeneus the prince. Howbeit, he had gone in his beaked ships up into"
10326,BOOK XIX.,"Ilios, with the sons of Atreus; but my famed name is Aethon, being the"
10327,BOOK XIX.,younger of the twain and he was the first born and the better man.
10328,BOOK XIX.,"There I saw Odysseus, and gave him guest-gifts, for the might of the"
10329,BOOK XIX.,"wind bare him too to Crete, as he was making for Troy land, and had"
10330,BOOK XIX.,"driven him wandering past Malea. So he stayed his ships in Amnisus,"
10331,BOOK XIX.,"whereby is the cave of Eilithyia, in havens hard to win, and scarce he"
10332,BOOK XIX.,escaped the tempest. Anon he came up to the city and asked for
10333,BOOK XIX.,"Idomeneus, saying that he was his friend and held by him in love and"
10334,BOOK XIX.,honour. But it was now the tenth or the eleventh dawn since Idomeneus
10335,BOOK XIX.,had gone in his beaked ships up into Ilios. Then I led him to the
10336,BOOK XIX.,"house, and gave him good entertainment with all loving-kindness out of"
10337,BOOK XIX.,"the plenty in my house, and for him and for the rest of his company,"
10338,BOOK XIX.,"that went with him, I gathered and gave barley meal and dark wine out"
10339,BOOK XIX.,"of the public store, and oxen to sacrifice to his heart’s desire. There"
10340,BOOK XIX.,"the goodly Achaeans abode twelve days, for the strong North Wind penned"
10341,BOOK XIX.,"them there, and suffered them not to stay upon the coast, for some"
10342,BOOK XIX.,"angry god had roused it. On the thirteenth day the wind fell, and then"
10343,BOOK XIX.,they lifted anchor.”
10344,BOOK XIX.,
10345,BOOK XIX.,"So he told many a false tale in the likeness of truth, and her tears"
10346,BOOK XIX.,"flowed as she listened, and her flesh melted. And even as the snow"
10347,BOOK XIX.,"melts in the high places of the hills, the snow that the South-East"
10348,BOOK XIX.,"wind has thawed, when the West has scattered it abroad, and as it"
10349,BOOK XIX.,"wastes the river streams run full, even so her fair cheeks melted"
10350,BOOK XIX.,"beneath her tears, as she wept her own lord, who even then was sitting"
10351,BOOK XIX.,by her. Now Odysseus had compassion of heart upon his wife in her
10352,BOOK XIX.,"lamenting, but his eyes kept steadfast between his eyelids as it were"
10353,BOOK XIX.,"horn or iron, and craftily he hid his tears. But she, when she had"
10354,BOOK XIX.,"taken her fill of tearful lamentation, answered him in turn and spake,"
10355,BOOK XIX.,saying:
10356,BOOK XIX.,
10357,BOOK XIX.,"“Friend as thou art, even now I think to make trial of thee, and learn"
10358,BOOK XIX.,whether in very truth thou didst entertain my lord there in thy halls
10359,BOOK XIX.,"with his godlike company, as thou sayest. Tell me what manner of"
10360,BOOK XIX.,"raiment he was clothed in about his body, and what manner of man he was"
10361,BOOK XIX.,"himself, and tell me of his fellows that went with him.”"
10362,BOOK XIX.,
10363,BOOK XIX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Lady, it is hard"
10364,BOOK XIX.,"for one so long parted from him to tell thee all this, for it is now"
10365,BOOK XIX.,the twentieth year since he went thither and left my country. Yet even
10366,BOOK XIX.,so I will tell thee as I see him in spirit. Goodly Odysseus wore a
10367,BOOK XIX.,"thick purple mantle, twofold, which had a brooch fashioned in gold,"
10368,BOOK XIX.,"with two sheathes for the pins, and on the face of it was a curious"
10369,BOOK XIX.,device: a hound in his forepaws held a dappled fawn and gazed on it as
10370,BOOK XIX.,"it writhed. And all men marvelled at the workmanship, how, wrought as"
10371,BOOK XIX.,"they were in gold, the hound was gazing on the fawn and strangling it,"
10372,BOOK XIX.,"and the fawn was writhing with his feet and striving to flee. Moreover,"
10373,BOOK XIX.,"I marked the shining doublet about his body, like the gleam over the"
10374,BOOK XIX.,"skin of a dried onion, so smooth it was, and glistering as the sun;"
10375,BOOK XIX.,truly many women looked thereon and wondered. Yet another thing will I
10376,BOOK XIX.,"tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart. I know not if Odysseus"
10377,BOOK XIX.,"was thus clothed upon at home, or if one of his fellows gave him the"
10378,BOOK XIX.,"raiment as he went on board the swift ship, or even it may be some"
10379,BOOK XIX.,"stranger, seeing that to many men was Odysseus dear, for few of the"
10380,BOOK XIX.,"Achaeans were his peers. I, too, gave him a sword of bronze, and a fair"
10381,BOOK XIX.,"purple mantle with double fold, and a tasseled doublet, and I sent him"
10382,BOOK XIX.,"away with all honour on his decked ship. Moreover, a henchman bare him"
10383,BOOK XIX.,"company, somewhat older than he, and I will tell thee of him too, what"
10384,BOOK XIX.,"manner of man he was. He was round-shouldered, black-skinned, and"
10385,BOOK XIX.,"curly-headed, his name Eurybates; and Odysseus honoured him above all"
10386,BOOK XIX.,"his company, because in all things he was like-minded with himself.”"
10387,BOOK XIX.,
10388,BOOK XIX.,"So he spake, and in her heart he stirred yet more the desire of"
10389,BOOK XIX.,"weeping, as she knew the certain tokens that Odysseus showed her. So"
10390,BOOK XIX.,"when she had taken her fill of tearful lament, then she answered him,"
10391,BOOK XIX.,and spake saying:
10392,BOOK XIX.,
10393,BOOK XIX.,"“Now verily, stranger, thou that even before wert held in pity, shalt"
10394,BOOK XIX.,"be dear and honourable in my halls, for it was I who gave him these"
10395,BOOK XIX.,"garments, as judging from thy words, and folded them myself, and"
10396,BOOK XIX.,"brought them from the chamber, and added besides the shining brooch to"
10397,BOOK XIX.,"be his jewel. But him I shall never welcome back, returned home to his"
10398,BOOK XIX.,own dear country. Wherefore with an evil fate it was that Odysseus went
10399,BOOK XIX.,"hence in the hollow ship to see that evil Ilios, never to be named.”"
10400,BOOK XIX.,
10401,BOOK XIX.,And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Wife revered of
10402,BOOK XIX.,"Odysseus, son of Laertes, destroy not now thy fair flesh any more, nor"
10403,BOOK XIX.,waste thy heart with weeping for thy lord;—not that I count it any
10404,BOOK XIX.,"blame in thee, for many a woman weeps that has lost her wedded lord, to"
10405,BOOK XIX.,"whom she has borne children in her love,—albeit a far other man than"
10406,BOOK XIX.,"Odysseus, who, they say, is like the gods. Nay, cease from thy"
10407,BOOK XIX.,"lamenting, and lay up my word in thy heart; for I will tell thee"
10408,BOOK XIX.,"without fail, and will hide nought, how but lately I heard tell of the"
10409,BOOK XIX.,"return of Odysseus, that he is nigh at hand, and yet alive in the fat"
10410,BOOK XIX.,"land of the men of Thesprotia, and is bringing with him many choice"
10411,BOOK XIX.,"treasures, as he begs through the land. But he has lost his dear"
10412,BOOK XIX.,"companions and his hollow ship on the wine-dark sea, on his way from"
10413,BOOK XIX.,"the isle Thrinacia: for Zeus and Helios had a grudge against him,"
10414,BOOK XIX.,because his company had slain the kine of Helios. They for their part
10415,BOOK XIX.,"all perished in the wash of the sea, but the wave cast him on the keel"
10416,BOOK XIX.,"of the ship out upon the coast, on the land of the Phaeacians that are"
10417,BOOK XIX.,"near of kin to the gods, and they did him all honour heartily as unto a"
10418,BOOK XIX.,"god, and gave him many gifts, and themselves would fain have sent him"
10419,BOOK XIX.,"scathless home. Yea and Odysseus would have been here long since, but"
10420,BOOK XIX.,"he thought it more profitable to gather wealth, as he journeyed over"
10421,BOOK XIX.,wide lands; so truly is Odysseus skilled in gainful arts above all men
10422,BOOK XIX.,"upon earth, nor may any mortal men contend with him. So Pheidon king of"
10423,BOOK XIX.,"the Thesprotians told me. Moreover he sware, in mine own presence, as"
10424,BOOK XIX.,"he poured the drink-offering in his house, that the ship was drawn down"
10425,BOOK XIX.,"to the sea and his company were ready, who were to convey him to his"
10426,BOOK XIX.,"own dear country. But me he first sent off, for it chanced that a ship"
10427,BOOK XIX.,"of the Thesprotians was on her way to Dulichium, a land rich in grain."
10428,BOOK XIX.,"And he showed me all the wealth that Odysseus had gathered, yea it"
10429,BOOK XIX.,"would suffice for his children after him, even to the tenth generation,"
10430,BOOK XIX.,so great were the treasures he had stored in the chambers of the king.
10431,BOOK XIX.,"As for him he had gone, he said, to Dodona to hear the counsel of Zeus,"
10432,BOOK XIX.,"from the high leafy oak tree of the god, how he should return to his"
10433,BOOK XIX.,"own dear country, having now been long afar, whether openly or by"
10434,BOOK XIX.,stealth.
10435,BOOK XIX.,
10436,BOOK XIX.,"“In this wise, as I tell thee, he is safe and will come shortly, and"
10437,BOOK XIX.,very near he is and will not much longer be far from his friends and
10438,BOOK XIX.,his own country; yet withal I will give thee my oath on it. Zeus be my
10439,BOOK XIX.,"witness first, of gods the highest and best, and the hearth of noble"
10440,BOOK XIX.,"Odysseus whereunto I am come, that all these things shall surely be"
10441,BOOK XIX.,accomplished even as I tell thee. In this same year Odysseus shall come
10442,BOOK XIX.,"hither, as the old moon wanes and the new is born.”"
10443,BOOK XIX.,
10444,BOOK XIX.,"Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah! stranger, would that this word"
10445,BOOK XIX.,may be accomplished. Soon shouldst thou be aware of kindness and many a
10446,BOOK XIX.,"gift at my hands, so that whoso met with thee would call thee blessed."
10447,BOOK XIX.,"But on this wise my heart has a boding, and so it shall be. Neither"
10448,BOOK XIX.,"shall Odysseus come home any more, nor shalt thou gain an escort hence,"
10449,BOOK XIX.,since there are not now such masters in the house as Odysseus was among
10450,BOOK XIX.,"men,—if ever such an one there was,—to welcome guests revered and speed"
10451,BOOK XIX.,"them on their way. But do ye, my handmaids, wash this man’s feet and"
10452,BOOK XIX.,"strew a couch for him, bedding and mantles and shining blankets, that"
10453,BOOK XIX.,well and warmly he may come to the time of golden-throned Dawn. And
10454,BOOK XIX.,"very early in the morning bathe him and anoint him, that within the"
10455,BOOK XIX.,"house beside Telemachus he may eat meat, sitting quietly in the hall."
10456,BOOK XIX.,"And it shall be the worse for any hurtful man of the wooers, that vexes"
10457,BOOK XIX.,"the stranger, yea he shall not henceforth profit himself here, for all"
10458,BOOK XIX.,"his sore anger. For how shalt thou learn concerning me, stranger,"
10459,BOOK XIX.,"whether indeed I excel all women in wit and thrifty device, if all"
10460,BOOK XIX.,unkempt and evil clad thou sittest at supper in my halls? Man’s life is
10461,BOOK XIX.,"brief enough! And if any be a hard man and hard at heart, all men cry"
10462,BOOK XIX.,"evil on him for the time to come, while yet he lives, and all men mock"
10463,BOOK XIX.,him when he is dead. But if any be a blameless man and blameless of
10464,BOOK XIX.,"heart, his guests spread abroad his fame over the whole earth and many"
10465,BOOK XIX.,people call him noble.”
10466,BOOK XIX.,
10467,BOOK XIX.,Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: “O wife revered
10468,BOOK XIX.,"of Odysseus, son of Laertes, mantles verily and shining blankets are"
10469,BOOK XIX.,"hateful to me, since first I left behind me the snowy hills of Crete,"
10470,BOOK XIX.,"voyaging in the long-oared galley; nay, I will lie as in time past I"
10471,BOOK XIX.,was used to rest through the sleepless nights. For full many a night I
10472,BOOK XIX.,"have lain on an unsightly bed, and awaited the bright throned Dawn. And"
10473,BOOK XIX.,"baths for the feet are no longer my delight, nor shall any women of"
10474,BOOK XIX.,"those who are serving maidens in thy house touch my foot, unless there"
10475,BOOK XIX.,"chance to be some old wife, true of heart, one that has borne as much"
10476,BOOK XIX.,trouble as myself; I would not grudge such an one to touch my feet.”
10477,BOOK XIX.,
10478,BOOK XIX.,"Then wise Penelope answered him: “Dear stranger, for never yet has"
10479,BOOK XIX.,"there come to my house, of strangers from afar, a dearer man or so"
10480,BOOK XIX.,"discreet as thou, uttering so heedfully the words of wisdom. I have an"
10481,BOOK XIX.,"ancient woman of an understanding heart, that diligently nursed and"
10482,BOOK XIX.,"tended that hapless man my lord, she took him in her arms in the hour"
10483,BOOK XIX.,"when his mother bare him. She will wash thy feet, albeit her strength"
10484,BOOK XIX.,"is frail. Up now, wise Eurycleia, and wash this man, whose years are"
10485,BOOK XIX.,the same as thy master’s. Yea and perchance such even now are the feet
10486,BOOK XIX.,"of Odysseus, and such too his hands, for quickly men age in misery.”"
10487,BOOK XIX.,
10488,BOOK XIX.,"So she spake, and the old woman covered her face with her hands and"
10489,BOOK XIX.,"shed hot tears, and spake a word of lamentation, saying:"
10490,BOOK XIX.,
10491,BOOK XIX.,"“Ah, woe is me, child, for thy sake, all helpless that I am! Surely"
10492,BOOK XIX.,"Zeus hated thee above all men, though thou hadst a god-fearing spirit!"
10493,BOOK XIX.,For never yet did any mortal burn so many fat pieces of the thigh and
10494,BOOK XIX.,"so many choice hecatombs to Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, as thou"
10495,BOOK XIX.,"didst give to him, praying that so thou mightest grow to a smooth old"
10496,BOOK XIX.,age and rear thy renowned son. But now from thee alone hath Zeus wholly
10497,BOOK XIX.,cut off the day of thy returning. Haply at him too did the women mock
10498,BOOK XIX.,"in a strange land afar, whensoever he came to the famous palace of any"
10499,BOOK XIX.,"lord, even as here these shameless ones all mock at thee. To shun their"
10500,BOOK XIX.,insults and many taunts it is that thou sufferest them not to wash thy
10501,BOOK XIX.,"feet, but the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, hath bidden me that"
10502,BOOK XIX.,"am right willing to this task. Wherefore I will wash thy feet, both for"
10503,BOOK XIX.,"Penelope’s sake and for thine own, for that my heart within me is moved"
10504,BOOK XIX.,"and troubled. But come, mark the word that I shall speak. Many"
10505,BOOK XIX.,"strangers travel-worn have ere now come hither, but I say that I have"
10506,BOOK XIX.,"never seen any so like another, as thou art like Odysseus, in fashion"
10507,BOOK XIX.,in voice and in feet.”
10508,BOOK XIX.,
10509,BOOK XIX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Old wife, even so"
10510,BOOK XIX.,"all men declare, that have beheld us twain, that we favour each other"
10511,BOOK XIX.,"exceedingly, even as thou dost mark and say.”"
10512,BOOK XIX.,
10513,BOOK XIX.,"Thereupon the crone took the shining cauldron, wherefrom[34] she set to"
10514,BOOK XIX.,"wash his feet, and poured in much cold water and next mingled therewith"
10515,BOOK XIX.,"the warm. Now Odysseus sat aloof from the hearth, and of a sudden he"
10516,BOOK XIX.,"turned his face to the darkness, for anon he had a misgiving of heart"
10517,BOOK XIX.,"lest when she handled him she might know the scar again, and all should"
10518,BOOK XIX.,"be revealed. Now she drew near her lord to wash him, and straightway"
10519,BOOK XIX.,"she knew the scar of the wound, that the boar had dealt him with his"
10520,BOOK XIX.,"white tusk long ago, when Odysseus went to Parnassus to see Autolycus,"
10521,BOOK XIX.,"and the sons of Autolycus, his mother’s noble father, who outdid all"
10522,BOOK XIX.,men in thievery and skill in swearing. This skill was the gift of the
10523,BOOK XIX.,"god himself, even Hermes, for that he burned to him the well-pleasing"
10524,BOOK XIX.,sacrifice of the thighs of lambs and kids; wherefore Hermes abetted him
10525,BOOK XIX.,"gladly. Now Autolycus once had gone to the rich land of Ithaca, and"
10526,BOOK XIX.,"found his daughter’s son a child new-born, and when he was making an"
10527,BOOK XIX.,"end of supper, behold, Eurycleia set the babe on his knees, and spake"
10528,BOOK XIX.,and hailed him: “Autolycus find now a name thyself to give thy child’s
10529,BOOK XIX.,"own son; for lo, he is a child of many prayers.”"
10530,BOOK XIX.,
10531,BOOK XIX.,[34] Reading τοῦ.
10532,BOOK XIX.,
10533,BOOK XIX.,
10534,BOOK XIX.,Then Autolycus made answer and spake: “My daughter and my daughter’s
10535,BOOK XIX.,"lord, give ye him whatsoever name I tell you. Forasmuch as I am come"
10536,BOOK XIX.,"hither in wrath against many a one, both man and woman, over the"
10537,BOOK XIX.,"fruitful earth, wherefore let the child’s name be ‘a man of wrath,’"
10538,BOOK XIX.,"Odysseus. But when the child reaches his full growth, and comes to the"
10539,BOOK XIX.,"great house of his mother’s kin at Parnassus, whereby are my"
10540,BOOK XIX.,"possessions, I will give him a gift out of these and send him on his"
10541,BOOK XIX.,way rejoicing.”
10542,BOOK XIX.,
10543,BOOK XIX.,Therefore it was that Odysseus went to receive the splendid gifts. And
10544,BOOK XIX.,Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus grasped his hands and greeted him
10545,BOOK XIX.,"with gentle words, and Amphithea, his mother’s mother, clasped him in"
10546,BOOK XIX.,her arms and kissed his face and both his fair eyes. Then Autolycus
10547,BOOK XIX.,"called to his renowned sons to get ready the meal, and they hearkened"
10548,BOOK XIX.,"to the call. So presently they led in a five-year-old bull, which they"
10549,BOOK XIX.,"flayed and busily prepared, and cut up all the limbs and deftly chopped"
10550,BOOK XIX.,"them small, and pierced them with spits and roasted them cunningly,"
10551,BOOK XIX.,dividing the messes. So for that livelong day they feasted till the
10552,BOOK XIX.,"going down of the sun, and their soul lacked not ought of the equal"
10553,BOOK XIX.,"banquet. But when the sun sank and darkness came on, they laid them to"
10554,BOOK XIX.,rest and took the boon of sleep.
10555,BOOK XIX.,
10556,BOOK XIX.,"Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, they all went"
10557,BOOK XIX.,"forth to the chase, the hounds and the sons of Autolycus, and with them"
10558,BOOK XIX.,went the goodly Odysseus. So they fared up the steep hill of wood-clad
10559,BOOK XIX.,"Parnassus, and quickly they came to the windy hollows. Now the sun was"
10560,BOOK XIX.,"but just striking on the fields, and was come forth from the soft"
10561,BOOK XIX.,flowing stream of deep Oceanus. Then the beaters reached a glade of the
10562,BOOK XIX.,"woodland, and before them went the hounds tracking a scent, but behind"
10563,BOOK XIX.,"came the sons of Autolycus, and among them goodly Odysseus followed"
10564,BOOK XIX.,"close on the hounds, swaying a long spear. Thereby in a thick lair was"
10565,BOOK XIX.,"a great boar lying, and through the coppice the force of the wet winds"
10566,BOOK XIX.,"blew never, neither did the bright sun light on it with his rays, nor"
10567,BOOK XIX.,"could the rain pierce through, so thick it was, and of fallen leaves"
10568,BOOK XIX.,there was great plenty therein. Then the tramp of the men’s feet and of
10569,BOOK XIX.,"the dogs came upon the boar, as they pressed on in the chase, and forth"
10570,BOOK XIX.,from his lair he sprang towards them with crest well bristled and fire
10571,BOOK XIX.,"shining in his eyes, and stood at bay before them all. Then Odysseus"
10572,BOOK XIX.,"was the first to rush in, holding his spear aloft in his strong hand,"
10573,BOOK XIX.,most eager to stab him; but the boar was too quick and drave a gash
10574,BOOK XIX.,"above the knee, ripping deep into the flesh with his tusk as he charged"
10575,BOOK XIX.,"sideways, but he reached not to the bone of the man. Then Odysseus"
10576,BOOK XIX.,"aimed well and smote him on his right shoulder, so that the point of"
10577,BOOK XIX.,"the bright spear went clean through, and the boar fell in the dust with"
10578,BOOK XIX.,"a cry, and his life passed from him. Then the dear sons of Autolycus"
10579,BOOK XIX.,"began to busy them with the carcase, and as for the wound of the noble"
10580,BOOK XIX.,"godlike Odysseus, they bound it up skilfully, and stayed the black"
10581,BOOK XIX.,"blood with a song of healing, and straight-way returned to the house of"
10582,BOOK XIX.,their dear father. Then Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus got him
10583,BOOK XIX.,"well healed of his hurt, and gave him splendid gifts, and quickly sent"
10584,BOOK XIX.,"him with all love to Ithaca, gladly speeding a glad guest. There his"
10585,BOOK XIX.,"father and lady mother were glad of his returning, and asked him of all"
10586,BOOK XIX.,"his adventures, and of his wound how he came by it, and duly he told"
10587,BOOK XIX.,"them all, namely how the boar gashed him with his white tusk in the"
10588,BOOK XIX.,"chase, when he had gone to Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus."
10589,BOOK XIX.,
10590,BOOK XIX.,"Now the old woman took the scarred limb and passed her hands down it,"
10591,BOOK XIX.,"and knew it by the touch and let the foot drop suddenly, so that the"
10592,BOOK XIX.,"knee fell into the bath, and the brazen vessel rang, being turned over"
10593,BOOK XIX.,"on the other side, and behold, the water was spilled on the ground."
10594,BOOK XIX.,"Then joy and anguish came on her in one moment, and both her eyes"
10595,BOOK XIX.,"filled up with tears, and the voice of her utterance was stayed, and"
10596,BOOK XIX.,"touching the chin of Odysseus she spake to him, saying:"
10597,BOOK XIX.,
10598,BOOK XIX.,"“Yea verily, thou art Odysseus, my dear child, and I knew thee not"
10599,BOOK XIX.,"before, till I had handled all the body of my lord.”"
10600,BOOK XIX.,
10601,BOOK XIX.,"Therewithal she looked towards Penelope, as minded to make a sign that"
10602,BOOK XIX.,her husband was now home. But Penelope could not meet her eyes nor take
10603,BOOK XIX.,"note of her, for Athene had bent her thoughts to other things. But"
10604,BOOK XIX.,Odysseus feeling for the old woman’s throat gript it with his right
10605,BOOK XIX.,"hand and with the other drew her closer to him and spake, saying:"
10606,BOOK XIX.,
10607,BOOK XIX.,"“Woman, why wouldest thou indeed destroy me? It was thou that didst"
10608,BOOK XIX.,"nurse me there at thine own breast, and now after travail and much pain"
10609,BOOK XIX.,I am come in the twentieth year to mine own country. But since thou art
10610,BOOK XIX.,"ware of me, and the god has put this in thy heart, be silent, lest"
10611,BOOK XIX.,another learn the matter in the halls. For on this wise I will declare
10612,BOOK XIX.,"it, and it shall surely be accomplished:—if the gods subdue the lordly"
10613,BOOK XIX.,"wooers unto me, I will not hold my hand from thee, my nurse though thou"
10614,BOOK XIX.,"art, when I slay the other handmaids in my halls.”"
10615,BOOK XIX.,
10616,BOOK XIX.,"Then wise Eurycleia answered, saying: “My child, what word hath escaped"
10617,BOOK XIX.,the door of thy lips? Thou knowest how firm is my spirit and
10618,BOOK XIX.,"unyielding, and I will keep me fast as stubborn stone or iron. Yet"
10619,BOOK XIX.,"another thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thine heart."
10620,BOOK XIX.,"If the gods subdue the lordly wooers to thy hand, then will I tell thee"
10621,BOOK XIX.,"all the tale of the women in the halls, which of them dishonour thee"
10622,BOOK XIX.,and which be guiltless.”
10623,BOOK XIX.,
10624,BOOK XIX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Nurse, wherefore I"
10625,BOOK XIX.,"pray thee wilt thou speak of these? Thou needest not, for even I myself"
10626,BOOK XIX.,"will mark them well and take knowledge of each. Nay, do thou keep thy"
10627,BOOK XIX.,"saying to thyself, and leave the rest to the gods.”"
10628,BOOK XIX.,
10629,BOOK XIX.,"Even so he spake, and the old woman passed forth from the hall to bring"
10630,BOOK XIX.,"water for his feet, for that first water was all spilled. So when she"
10631,BOOK XIX.,"had washed him and anointed him well with olive-oil, Odysseus again"
10632,BOOK XIX.,"drew up his settle nearer to the fire to warm himself, and covered up"
10633,BOOK XIX.,"the scar with his rags. Then the wise Penelope spake first, saying:"
10634,BOOK XIX.,
10635,BOOK XIX.,"“Stranger, there is yet a little thing I will make bold to ask thee,"
10636,BOOK XIX.,"for soon will it be the hour for pleasant rest, for him on whomsoever"
10637,BOOK XIX.,"sweet sleep falls, though he be heavy with care. But to me has the god"
10638,BOOK XIX.,"given sorrow, yea sorrow measureless, for all the day I have my fill of"
10639,BOOK XIX.,"wailing and lamenting, as I look to mine own housewiferies and to the"
10640,BOOK XIX.,tasks of the maidens in the house. But when night comes and sleep takes
10641,BOOK XIX.,"hold of all, I lie on my couch, and shrewd cares, thick thronging about"
10642,BOOK XIX.,"my inmost heart, disquiet me in my sorrowing. Even as when the daughter"
10643,BOOK XIX.,"of Pandareus, the nightingale of the greenwood, sings sweet in the"
10644,BOOK XIX.,"first season of the spring, from her place in the thick leafage of the"
10645,BOOK XIX.,"trees, and with many a turn and trill she pours forth her full-voiced"
10646,BOOK XIX.,"music bewailing her child, dear Itylus, whom on a time she slew with"
10647,BOOK XIX.,"the sword unwitting, Itylus the son of Zethus the prince; even as her"
10648,BOOK XIX.,"song, my troubled soul sways to and fro. Shall I abide with my son, and"
10649,BOOK XIX.,"keep all secure, all the things of my getting, my thralls and great"
10650,BOOK XIX.,"high-roofed home, having respect unto the bed of my lord and the voice"
10651,BOOK XIX.,"of the people, or even now follow with the best of the Achaeans that"
10652,BOOK XIX.,"woos me in the halls, and gives a bride-price beyond reckoning? Now my"
10653,BOOK XIX.,"son, so long as he was a child and light of heart, suffered me not to"
10654,BOOK XIX.,marry and leave the house of my husband; but now that he is great of
10655,BOOK XIX.,"growth, and is come to the full measure of manhood, lo now he prays me"
10656,BOOK XIX.,"to go back home from these walls, being vexed for his possessions that"
10657,BOOK XIX.,"the Achaeans devour before his eyes. But come now, hear a dream of mine"
10658,BOOK XIX.,and tell me the interpretation thereof. Twenty geese I have in the
10659,BOOK XIX.,"house, that eat wheat, coming forth from the water, and I am gladdened"
10660,BOOK XIX.,at the sight. Now a great eagle of crooked beak swooped from the
10661,BOOK XIX.,"mountain, and brake all their necks and slew them; and they lay strewn"
10662,BOOK XIX.,"in a heap in the halls, while he was borne aloft to the bright air."
10663,BOOK XIX.,"Thereon I wept and wailed, in a dream though it was, and around me were"
10664,BOOK XIX.,"gathered the fair-tressed Achaean women as I made piteous lament, for"
10665,BOOK XIX.,that the eagle had slain my geese. But he came back and sat him down on
10666,BOOK XIX.,"a jutting point of the roof-beam, and with the voice of a man he spake,"
10667,BOOK XIX.,and stayed my weeping:
10668,BOOK XIX.,
10669,BOOK XIX.,"“‘Take heart, O daughter of renowned Icarius; this is no dream but a"
10670,BOOK XIX.,"true vision, that shall be accomplished for thee. The geese are the"
10671,BOOK XIX.,"wooers, and I that before was the eagle am now thy husband come again,"
10672,BOOK XIX.,who will let slip unsightly death upon all the wooers.’ With that word
10673,BOOK XIX.,"sweet slumber let me go, and I looked about, and beheld the geese in"
10674,BOOK XIX.,"the court pecking their wheat at the trough, where they were wont"
10675,BOOK XIX.,before.”
10676,BOOK XIX.,
10677,BOOK XIX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: “Lady, none may"
10678,BOOK XIX.,"turn aside the dream to interpret it otherwise, seeing that Odysseus"
10679,BOOK XIX.,himself hath showed thee how he will fulfil it. For the wooers
10680,BOOK XIX.,"destruction is clearly boded, for all and every one; not a man shall"
10681,BOOK XIX.,avoid death and the fates.”
10682,BOOK XIX.,
10683,BOOK XIX.,"Then wise Penelope answered him: “Stranger, verily dreams are hard, and"
10684,BOOK XIX.,hard to be discerned; nor are all things therein fulfilled for men.
10685,BOOK XIX.,"Twain are the gates of shadowy dreams, the one is fashioned of horn and"
10686,BOOK XIX.,one of ivory. Such dreams as pass through the portals of sawn ivory are
10687,BOOK XIX.,"deceitful, and bear tidings that are unfulfilled. But the dreams that"
10688,BOOK XIX.,"come forth through the gates of polished horn bring a true issue,"
10689,BOOK XIX.,whosoever of mortals beholds them. Yet methinks my strange dream came
10690,BOOK XIX.,not thence; of a truth that would be most welcome to me and to my son.
10691,BOOK XIX.,"But another thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart."
10692,BOOK XIX.,"Lo, even now draws nigh the morn of evil name, that is to sever me from"
10693,BOOK XIX.,"the house of Odysseus, for now I am about to ordain for a trial those"
10694,BOOK XIX.,"axes that he would set up in a row in his halls, like stays of oak in"
10695,BOOK XIX.,"ship-building, twelve in all, and he would stand far apart and shoot"
10696,BOOK XIX.,his arrow through them all. And now I will offer this contest to the
10697,BOOK XIX.,"wooers; whoso shall most easily string the bow in his hands, and shoot"
10698,BOOK XIX.,"through all twelve axes, with him will I go and forsake this house,"
10699,BOOK XIX.,"this house of my wedlock, so fair and filled with all livelihood, which"
10700,BOOK XIX.,"methinks I shall yet remember, aye, in a dream.”"
10701,BOOK XIX.,
10702,BOOK XIX.,Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: “Wife revered of
10703,BOOK XIX.,"Odysseus son of Laertes, no longer delay this contest in thy halls;"
10704,BOOK XIX.,"for, lo, Odysseus of many counsels will be here, before these men, for"
10705,BOOK XIX.,"all their handling of this polished bow, shall have strung it, and shot"
10706,BOOK XIX.,the arrow through the iron.”
10707,BOOK XIX.,
10708,BOOK XIX.,"Then the wise Penelope answered him: “Stranger, if only thou wert"
10709,BOOK XIX.,"willing still to sit beside me in the halls and to delight me, not upon"
10710,BOOK XIX.,my eyelids would sleep be shed. But men may in no wise abide sleepless
10711,BOOK XIX.,"ever, for the immortals have made a time for all things for mortals on"
10712,BOOK XIX.,"the grain-giving earth. Howbeit I will go aloft to my upper chamber,"
10713,BOOK XIX.,"and lay me on my bed, the place of my groanings, that is ever watered"
10714,BOOK XIX.,"by my tears, since the day that Odysseus went to see that evil Ilios,"
10715,BOOK XIX.,"never to be named. There will I lay me down, but do thou lie in this"
10716,BOOK XIX.,"house; either strew thee somewhat on the floor, or let them lay bedding"
10717,BOOK XIX.,for thee.”
10718,BOOK XIX.,
10719,BOOK XIX.,"Therewith she ascended to her shining upper chamber, not alone, for"
10720,BOOK XIX.,with her likewise went her handmaids. So she went aloft to her upper
10721,BOOK XIX.,"chamber with the women her handmaids, and there was bewailing Odysseus,"
10722,BOOK XIX.,"her dear lord, till grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids."
10723,BOOK XIX.,
10724,BOOK XIX.,
10725,BOOK XIX.,
10726,BOOK XX.,BOOK XX.
10727,BOOK XX.,
10728,BOOK XX.,
10729,BOOK XX.,Pallas and Odysseus consult of the killing of the wooers.
10730,BOOK XX.,
10731,BOOK XX.,
10732,BOOK XX.,But the goodly Odysseus laid him down to sleep in the vestibule of the
10733,BOOK XX.,house. He spread an undressed bull’s hide on the ground and above it
10734,BOOK XX.,"many fleeces of sheep, that the Achaeans were wont to slay in"
10735,BOOK XX.,"sacrifice, and Eurynome threw a mantle over him where he lay. There"
10736,BOOK XX.,"Odysseus lay wakeful, with evil thoughts against the wooers in his"
10737,BOOK XX.,"heart. And the women came forth from their chamber, that aforetime were"
10738,BOOK XX.,"wont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and mirth among"
10739,BOOK XX.,"themselves. Then the heart of Odysseus was stirred within his breast,"
10740,BOOK XX.,"and much he communed with his mind and soul, whether he should leap"
10741,BOOK XX.,"forth upon them and deal death to each, or suffer them to lie with the"
10742,BOOK XX.,"proud wooers, now for the last and latest time. And his heart growled"
10743,BOOK XX.,sullenly within him. And even as a bitch stands over her tender whelps
10744,BOOK XX.,"growling, when she spies a man she knows not, and she is eager to"
10745,BOOK XX.,"assail him, so growled his heart within him in his wrath at their evil"
10746,BOOK XX.,"deeds. Then he smote upon his breast and rebuked his own heart, saying:"
10747,BOOK XX.,
10748,BOOK XX.,"“Endure, my heart; yea, a baser thing thou once didst bear, on that day"
10749,BOOK XX.,"when the Cyclops, unrestrained in fury, devoured the mighty men of my"
10750,BOOK XX.,company; but still thou didst endure till thy craft found a way for
10751,BOOK XX.,"thee forth from out the cave, where thou thoughtest to die.”"
10752,BOOK XX.,
10753,BOOK XX.,"So spake he, chiding his own spirit within him, and his heart verily"
10754,BOOK XX.,abode steadfast in obedience to his word. But Odysseus himself lay
10755,BOOK XX.,tossing this way and that. And as when a man by a great fire burning
10756,BOOK XX.,"takes a paunch full of fat and blood, and turns it this way and that"
10757,BOOK XX.,"and longs to have it roasted most speedily, so Odysseus tossed from"
10758,BOOK XX.,"side to side, musing how he might stretch forth his hands upon the"
10759,BOOK XX.,"shameless wooers, being but one man against so many. Then down from"
10760,BOOK XX.,"heaven came Athene and drew nigh him, fashioned in the likeness of a"
10761,BOOK XX.,"woman. And she stood over his head and spake to him, saying:"
10762,BOOK XX.,
10763,BOOK XX.,"“Lo now again, wherefore art thou watching, most luckless of all men"
10764,BOOK XX.,living? Is not this thy house and is not thy wife there within and thy
10765,BOOK XX.,"child, such a son as men wish to have for their own?”"
10766,BOOK XX.,
10767,BOOK XX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Yea, goddess, all"
10768,BOOK XX.,this thou hast spoken as is meet. But my heart within me muses in some
10769,BOOK XX.,"measure upon this, how I may stretch forth my hands upon the shameless"
10770,BOOK XX.,"wooers, being but one man, while they abide ever in their companies"
10771,BOOK XX.,within. Moreover this other and harder matter I ponder in my heart:
10772,BOOK XX.,"even if I were to slay them by thy will and the will of Zeus, whither"
10773,BOOK XX.,"should I flee from the avengers? Look well to this, I pray thee.”"
10774,BOOK XX.,
10775,BOOK XX.,"Then answered the goddess, grey-eyed Athene: “O hard of belief! yea,"
10776,BOOK XX.,"many there be that trust even in a weaker friend than I am, in one that"
10777,BOOK XX.,"is a mortal and knows not such craft as mine; but I am a god, that"
10778,BOOK XX.,"preserve thee to the end, in all manner of toils. And now I will tell"
10779,BOOK XX.,thee plainly; even should fifty companies of mortal men compass us
10780,BOOK XX.,"about eager to slay us in battle, even their kine shouldst thou drive"
10781,BOOK XX.,off and their brave flocks. But let sleep in turn come over thee; to
10782,BOOK XX.,"wake and to watch all night, this too is vexation of spirit; and soon"
10783,BOOK XX.,shalt thou rise from out of thy troubles.”
10784,BOOK XX.,
10785,BOOK XX.,"So she spake and poured slumber upon his eyelids, but for her part the"
10786,BOOK XX.,fair goddess went back to Olympus.
10787,BOOK XX.,
10788,BOOK XX.,"While sleep laid hold of him loosening the cares of his soul, sleep"
10789,BOOK XX.,"that loosens the limbs of men, his good wife awoke and wept as she sat"
10790,BOOK XX.,"on her soft bed. But when she had taken her fill of weeping, to Artemis"
10791,BOOK XX.,first the fair lady made her prayer:
10792,BOOK XX.,
10793,BOOK XX.,"“Artemis, lady and goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that even now thou"
10794,BOOK XX.,"wouldst plant thy shaft within my breast and take my life away, even in"
10795,BOOK XX.,"this hour! Or else, would that the stormwind might snatch me up, and"
10796,BOOK XX.,"bear me hence down the dusky ways, and cast me forth where the"
10797,BOOK XX.,back-flowing Oceanus mingles with the sea. It should be even as when
10798,BOOK XX.,the stormwinds bare away the daughters of Pandareus. Their father and
10799,BOOK XX.,"their mother the gods had slain, and the maidens were left orphans in"
10800,BOOK XX.,"the halls, and fair Aphrodite cherished them with curds and sweet honey"
10801,BOOK XX.,and delicious wine. And Here gave them beauty and wisdom beyond the lot
10802,BOOK XX.,"of women, and holy Artemis dowered them with stature, and Athene taught"
10803,BOOK XX.,them skill in all famous handiwork. Now while fair Aphrodite was
10804,BOOK XX.,"wending to high Olympus, to pray that a glad marriage might be"
10805,BOOK XX.,"accomplished for the maidens,—and to Zeus she went whose joy is in the"
10806,BOOK XX.,"thunder, for he knows all things well, what the fates give and deny to"
10807,BOOK XX.,mortal men—in the meanwhile the spirits of the storm snatched away
10808,BOOK XX.,"these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the hateful Erinyes."
10809,BOOK XX.,Would that in such wise they that hold the mansions of Olympus would
10810,BOOK XX.,"take me from the sight of men, or that fair-stressed Artemis would"
10811,BOOK XX.,"strike me, that so with a vision of Odysseus before mine eyes I might"
10812,BOOK XX.,"even pass beneath the dreadful earth, nor ever make a baser man’s"
10813,BOOK XX.,"delight! But herein is an evil that may well be borne, namely, when a"
10814,BOOK XX.,"man weeps all the day long in great sorrow of heart, but sleep takes"
10815,BOOK XX.,"him in the night, for sleep makes him forgetful of all things, of good"
10816,BOOK XX.,"and evil, when once it has overshadowed his eyelids. But as for me,"
10817,BOOK XX.,"even the dreams that the gods send upon me are evil. For furthermore,"
10818,BOOK XX.,"this very night one seemed to lie by my side, in the likeness of my"
10819,BOOK XX.,"lord, as he was when he went with the host, and then was my heart glad,"
10820,BOOK XX.,since methought it was no vain dream but a clear vision at the last.”
10821,BOOK XX.,
10822,BOOK XX.,"So she spake, and anon came the golden throned Dawn. Now goodly"
10823,BOOK XX.,"Odysseus caught the voice of her weeping, and then he fell a musing,"
10824,BOOK XX.,and it seemed to him that even now she knew him and was standing by his
10825,BOOK XX.,"head. So he took up the mantle and the fleeces whereon he was lying,"
10826,BOOK XX.,"and set them on a high seat in the hall, and bare out the bull’s hide"
10827,BOOK XX.,"out of doors and laid it there, and lifting up his hands he prayed to"
10828,BOOK XX.,Zeus:
10829,BOOK XX.,
10830,BOOK XX.,"“Father Zeus, if ye gods of your good will have led me over wet and"
10831,BOOK XX.,"dry, to mine own country, after ye had plagued me sore, let some one I"
10832,BOOK XX.,"pray of the folk that are waking show me a word of good omen within,"
10833,BOOK XX.,and without let some sign also be revealed to me from Zeus.”
10834,BOOK XX.,
10835,BOOK XX.,"So he spake in prayer, and Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway"
10836,BOOK XX.,"he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high from the place of"
10837,BOOK XX.,"clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad. Moreover a woman, a grinder at"
10838,BOOK XX.,"the mill, uttered a voice of omen from within the house hard by, where"
10839,BOOK XX.,stood the mills of the shepherd of the people. At these handmills
10840,BOOK XX.,"twelve women in all plied their task, making meal of barley and of"
10841,BOOK XX.,"wheat, the marrow of men. Now all the others were asleep, for they had"
10842,BOOK XX.,"ground out their task of grain, but one alone rested not yet, being the"
10843,BOOK XX.,"weakest of all. She now stayed her quern and spake a word, a sign to"
10844,BOOK XX.,her lord:
10845,BOOK XX.,
10846,BOOK XX.,"“Father Zeus, who rulest over gods and men, loudly hast thou thundered"
10847,BOOK XX.,"from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there a cloud to be seen: this"
10848,BOOK XX.,"surely is a portent thou art showing to some mortal. Fulfil now, I pray"
10849,BOOK XX.,"thee, even to miserable me, the word that I shall speak. May the"
10850,BOOK XX.,"wooers, on this day, for the last and latest time make their sweet"
10851,BOOK XX.,feasting in the halls of Odysseus! They that have loosened my knees
10852,BOOK XX.,"with cruel toil to grind their barley meal, may they now sup their"
10853,BOOK XX.,last!”
10854,BOOK XX.,
10855,BOOK XX.,"Thus she spake, and goodly Odysseus was glad in the omen of the voice"
10856,BOOK XX.,and in the thunder of Zeus; for he thought that he had gotten his
10857,BOOK XX.,vengeance on the guilty.
10858,BOOK XX.,
10859,BOOK XX.,"Now the other maidens in the fair halls of Odysseus had gathered, and"
10860,BOOK XX.,were kindling on the hearth the never-resting fire. And Telemachus rose
10861,BOOK XX.,"from his bed, a godlike man, and put on his raiment, and slung a sharp"
10862,BOOK XX.,"sword about his shoulders, and beneath his shining feet he bound his"
10863,BOOK XX.,goodly sandals. And he caught up his mighty spear shod with sharp
10864,BOOK XX.,"bronze, and went and stood by the threshold, and spake to Eurycleia:"
10865,BOOK XX.,
10866,BOOK XX.,"“Dear nurse, have ye honoured our guest in the house with food and"
10867,BOOK XX.,"couch, or does he lie uncared for, as he may? For this is my mother’s"
10868,BOOK XX.,"way, wise as she is: blindly she honours one of mortal men, even the"
10869,BOOK XX.,"worse, but the better she sends without honour away.”"
10870,BOOK XX.,
10871,BOOK XX.,"Then the prudent Eurycleia answered: “Nay, my child, thou shouldst not"
10872,BOOK XX.,"now blame her where no blame is. For the stranger sat and drank wine,"
10873,BOOK XX.,"so long as he would, and of food he said he was no longer fain, for thy"
10874,BOOK XX.,"mother asked him. Moreover, against the hour when he should bethink him"
10875,BOOK XX.,"of rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew for him a bed. But he, as"
10876,BOOK XX.,"one utterly wretched and ill-fated, refused to lie on a couch and under"
10877,BOOK XX.,"blankets, but on an undressed hide and on the fleeces of sheep he slept"
10878,BOOK XX.,"in the vestibule, and we cast a mantle over him.”"
10879,BOOK XX.,
10880,BOOK XX.,"So she spake, and Telemachus passed out through the hall with his lance"
10881,BOOK XX.,"in his hand, and two fleet dogs bare him company. He went on his way to"
10882,BOOK XX.,the assembly-place to join the goodly-greaved Achaeans. But the good
10883,BOOK XX.,"lady Eurycleia, daughter of Ops son of Peisenor, called aloud to her"
10884,BOOK XX.,maidens:
10885,BOOK XX.,
10886,BOOK XX.,"“Come hither, let some of you go busily and sweep the hall, and"
10887,BOOK XX.,"sprinkle it, and on the fair-fashioned seats throw purple coverlets,"
10888,BOOK XX.,"and others with sponges wipe all the tables clean, and cleanse the"
10889,BOOK XX.,"mixing bowls and well-wrought double beakers, and others again go for"
10890,BOOK XX.,"water to the well, and return with it right speedily. For the wooers"
10891,BOOK XX.,"will not long be out of the hall but will return very early, for it is"
10892,BOOK XX.,"a feast day, yea for all the people.”"
10893,BOOK XX.,
10894,BOOK XX.,"So she spake, and they all gave ready ear and hearkened. Twenty of them"
10895,BOOK XX.,"went to the well of dark water, and the others there in the halls were"
10896,BOOK XX.,busy with skilful hands.
10897,BOOK XX.,
10898,BOOK XX.,Then in came the serving-men of the Achaeans. Thereon they cleft the
10899,BOOK XX.,"faggots well and cunningly, while, behold, the women came back from the"
10900,BOOK XX.,"well. Then the swineherd joined them leading three fatted boars, the"
10901,BOOK XX.,best in all the flock. These he left to feed at large in the fair
10902,BOOK XX.,"courts, but as for him he spake to Odysseus gently, saying:"
10903,BOOK XX.,
10904,BOOK XX.,"“Tell me, stranger, do the Achaeans at all look on thee with more"
10905,BOOK XX.,"regard, or do they dishonour thee in the halls, as heretofore?”"
10906,BOOK XX.,
10907,BOOK XX.,Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:
10908,BOOK XX.,
10909,BOOK XX.,"“Oh, that the gods, Eumaeus, may avenge the scorn wherewith these men"
10910,BOOK XX.,"deal insolently, and devise infatuate deeds in another’s house, and"
10911,BOOK XX.,have no place for shame!”
10912,BOOK XX.,
10913,BOOK XX.,"On such wise they spake one to another. And Melanthius drew near them,"
10914,BOOK XX.,"the goatherd, leading the goats that were most excellent in all the"
10915,BOOK XX.,"herds to be a dinner for the wooers, and two shepherds bare him"
10916,BOOK XX.,"company. So he tethered the goats beneath the echoing gallery, and"
10917,BOOK XX.,"himself spake to Odysseus and taunted him, saying:"
10918,BOOK XX.,
10919,BOOK XX.,"“Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here in the hall, with thy"
10920,BOOK XX.,"begging of men, and wilt not get thee gone? In no wise do I think we"
10921,BOOK XX.,"twain will be sundered, till we taste each the other’s fists, for thy"
10922,BOOK XX.,begging is out of all order. Also there are elsewhere other feasts of
10923,BOOK XX.,the Achaeans.”
10924,BOOK XX.,
10925,BOOK XX.,"So he spake, but Odysseus of many counsels answered him not a word, but"
10926,BOOK XX.,"in silence he shook his head, brooding evil in the deep of his heart."
10927,BOOK XX.,
10928,BOOK XX.,"Moreover a third man came up, Philoetius, a master of men, leading a"
10929,BOOK XX.,barren heifer for the wooers and fatted goats. Now ferrymen had brought
10930,BOOK XX.,"them over from the mainland, boatmen who send even other folks on their"
10931,BOOK XX.,"way, whosoever comes to them. The cattle he tethered carefully beneath"
10932,BOOK XX.,"the echoing gallery, and himself drew close to the swineherd, and began"
10933,BOOK XX.,to question him:
10934,BOOK XX.,
10935,BOOK XX.,"“Swineherd, who is this stranger but newly come to our house? From what"
10936,BOOK XX.,men does he claim his birth? Where are his kin and his native fields?
10937,BOOK XX.,"Hapless is he, yet in fashion he is like a royal lord; but the gods mar"
10938,BOOK XX.,"the goodliness of wandering men, when even for kings they have woven"
10939,BOOK XX.,the web of trouble.”
10940,BOOK XX.,
10941,BOOK XX.,"So he spake, and came close to him offering his right hand in welcome,"
10942,BOOK XX.,and uttering his voice spake to him winged words:
10943,BOOK XX.,
10944,BOOK XX.,"“Father and stranger, hail! may happiness be thine in the time to come;"
10945,BOOK XX.,"but as now, thou art fast holden in many sorrows! Father Zeus, none"
10946,BOOK XX.,"other god is more baneful than thou; thou hast no compassion on men,"
10947,BOOK XX.,"that are of thine own begetting, but makest them to have fellowship"
10948,BOOK XX.,with evil and with bitter pains. The sweat brake out on me when I
10949,BOOK XX.,"beheld him, and mine eyes stand full of tears for memory of Odysseus,"
10950,BOOK XX.,"for he too, methinks, is clad in such vile raiment as this, and is"
10951,BOOK XX.,"wandering among men, if haply he yet lives and sees the sunlight. But"
10952,BOOK XX.,"if he be dead already and in the house of Hades, then woe is me for the"
10953,BOOK XX.,"noble Odysseus, who set me over his cattle while I was but a lad in the"
10954,BOOK XX.,land of the Cephallenians. And now these wax numberless; in no better
10955,BOOK XX.,"wise could the breed of broad-browed cattle of any mortal increase,"
10956,BOOK XX.,even as the ears of corn. But strangers command me to be ever driving
10957,BOOK XX.,"these for themselves to devour, and they care nothing for the heir in"
10958,BOOK XX.,"the house, nor tremble at the vengeance of the gods, for they are eager"
10959,BOOK XX.,even now to divide among themselves the possessions of our lord who is
10960,BOOK XX.,long afar. Now my heart within my breast often revolves this thing.
10961,BOOK XX.,"Truly it were an evil deed, while a son of the master is yet alive, to"
10962,BOOK XX.,"get me away to the land of strangers, and go off, with cattle and all,"
10963,BOOK XX.,"to alien men. But this is more grievous still, to abide here in"
10964,BOOK XX.,"affliction watching over the herds of other men. Yea, long ago I would"
10965,BOOK XX.,"have fled and gone forth to some other of the proud kings, for things"
10966,BOOK XX.,"are now past sufferance; but still my thought is of that hapless one,"
10967,BOOK XX.,"if he might come I know not whence, and make a scattering of the wooers"
10968,BOOK XX.,in the halls.”
10969,BOOK XX.,
10970,BOOK XX.,Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:
10971,BOOK XX.,
10972,BOOK XX.,"“Neatherd, seeing thou art not like to an evil man or a foolish, and of"
10973,BOOK XX.,"myself I mark how that thou hast gotten understanding of heart,"
10974,BOOK XX.,"therefore I will tell thee somewhat, and swear a great oath to confirm"
10975,BOOK XX.,"it. Be Zeus now my witness before any god, and the hospitable board and"
10976,BOOK XX.,"the hearth of noble Odysseus, whereunto I am come, that while thou art"
10977,BOOK XX.,"still in this place Odysseus shall come home, and thou shalt see with"
10978,BOOK XX.,"thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying of the wooers who lord it here.”"
10979,BOOK XX.,
10980,BOOK XX.,"Then the neatherd made answer, saying:"
10981,BOOK XX.,
10982,BOOK XX.,"“Ah, would, stranger, that Cronion may accomplish this word! So"
10983,BOOK XX.,"shouldst thou know what my might is, and how my hands follow to obey.”"
10984,BOOK XX.,
10985,BOOK XX.,"In like manner Eumaeus prayed to all the gods, that wise Odysseus might"
10986,BOOK XX.,return to his own home.
10987,BOOK XX.,
10988,BOOK XX.,"On such wise they spake one to the other, but the wooers at that time"
10989,BOOK XX.,were framing death and doom for Telemachus. Even so there came by them
10990,BOOK XX.,"a bird on their left, an eagle of lofty flight, with a cowering dove in"
10991,BOOK XX.,his clutch. Then Amphinomus made harangue and spake among them:
10992,BOOK XX.,
10993,BOOK XX.,"“Friends, this counsel of ours will not go well, namely, the slaying of"
10994,BOOK XX.,Telemachus; rather let us bethink us of the feast.”
10995,BOOK XX.,
10996,BOOK XX.,"So spake Amphinomus, and his saying pleased them well. They passed into"
10997,BOOK XX.,the halls of godlike Odysseus and laid by their mantles on the chairs
10998,BOOK XX.,"and high seats, and sacrificed great sheep and stout goats and the"
10999,BOOK XX.,fatlings of the boars and the heifer of the herd; then they roasted the
11000,BOOK XX.,"entrails and served them round and mixed wine in the bowl, and the"
11001,BOOK XX.,"swineherd set a cup by each man. And Philoetius, a master of men,"
11002,BOOK XX.,"handed them wheaten bread in beautiful baskets, and Melanthius poured"
11003,BOOK XX.,out the wine. So they put forth their hands on the good cheer set
11004,BOOK XX.,before them.
11005,BOOK XX.,
11006,BOOK XX.,"Now Telemachus, in his crafty purpose, made Odysseus to sit down within"
11007,BOOK XX.,"the stablished hall by the threshold of stone, and placed for him a"
11008,BOOK XX.,"mean settle and a little table. He set by him his mess of the entrails,"
11009,BOOK XX.,"and poured wine into a golden cup and spake to him, saying:"
11010,BOOK XX.,
11011,BOOK XX.,"“There, sit thee down, drinking thy wine among the lords, and the"
11012,BOOK XX.,"taunts and buffets of all the wooers I myself will ward off from thee,"
11013,BOOK XX.,"for this is no house of public resort, but the very house of Odysseus,"
11014,BOOK XX.,"and for me he won it. But, ye wooers, refrain your minds from rebukes"
11015,BOOK XX.,"and your hands from buffets, that no strife and feud may arise.”"
11016,BOOK XX.,
11017,BOOK XX.,"So he said, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus, in"
11018,BOOK XX.,"that he spake boldly. Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake among"
11019,BOOK XX.,"them, saying:"
11020,BOOK XX.,
11021,BOOK XX.,"“Hard though the word be, let us accept it, Achaeans, even the word of"
11022,BOOK XX.,"Telemachus, though mightily he threatens us in his speech. For Zeus"
11023,BOOK XX.,"Cronion hath hindered us of our purpose, else would we have silenced"
11024,BOOK XX.,"him in our halls, shrill orator as he is.”"
11025,BOOK XX.,
11026,BOOK XX.,"So spake Antinous, but Telemachus took no heed of his words. Now the"
11027,BOOK XX.,"henchmen were leading through the town the holy hecatomb of the gods,"
11028,BOOK XX.,"and lo, the long-haired Achaeans were gathered beneath the shady grove"
11029,BOOK XX.,"of Apollo, the prince of archery."
11030,BOOK XX.,
11031,BOOK XX.,"Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits,"
11032,BOOK XX.,they divided the messes and shared the glorious feast. And beside
11033,BOOK XX.,"Odysseus they that waited set an equal share, the same as that which"
11034,BOOK XX.,"fell to themselves, for so Telemachus commanded, the dear son of divine"
11035,BOOK XX.,Odysseus.
11036,BOOK XX.,
11037,BOOK XX.,Now Athene would in nowise suffer the lordly wooers to abstain from
11038,BOOK XX.,"biting scorn, that the pain might sink yet the deeper into the heart of"
11039,BOOK XX.,"Odysseus, son of Laertes. There was among the wooers a man of a lawless"
11040,BOOK XX.,"heart, Ctesippus was his name, and in Same was his home, who trusting,"
11041,BOOK XX.,"forsooth, to his vast possessions, was wooing the wife of Odysseus the"
11042,BOOK XX.,lord long afar. And now he spake among the proud wooers:
11043,BOOK XX.,
11044,BOOK XX.,"“Hear me, ye lordly wooers, and I will say somewhat. The stranger"
11045,BOOK XX.,"verily has long had his due portion, as is meet, an equal share; for it"
11046,BOOK XX.,"is not fair nor just to rob the guests of Telemachus of their right,"
11047,BOOK XX.,"whosoever they may be that come to this house. Go to then, I also will"
11048,BOOK XX.,"bestow on him a stranger’s gift, that he in turn may give a present"
11049,BOOK XX.,"either to the bath-woman, or to any other of the thralls within the"
11050,BOOK XX.,house of godlike Odysseus.”
11051,BOOK XX.,
11052,BOOK XX.,"Therewith he caught up an ox’s foot from the dish, where it lay, and"
11053,BOOK XX.,hurled it with strong hand. But Odysseus lightly avoided it with a turn
11054,BOOK XX.,"of his head, and smiled right grimly in his heart, and the ox’s foot"
11055,BOOK XX.,"smote the well-builded wall. Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, saying:"
11056,BOOK XX.,
11057,BOOK XX.,"“Verily, Ctesippus, it has turned out happier for thy heart’s pleasure"
11058,BOOK XX.,"as it is! Thou didst not smite the stranger, for he himself avoided"
11059,BOOK XX.,"that which was cast at him, else surely would I have struck thee"
11060,BOOK XX.,"through the midst with the sharp spear, and in place of wedding banquet"
11061,BOOK XX.,thy father would have had to busy him about a funeral feast in this
11062,BOOK XX.,place. Wherefore let no man make show of unseemly deeds in this my
11063,BOOK XX.,"house, for now I have understanding to discern both good and evil, but"
11064,BOOK XX.,"in time past I was yet a child. But as needs we must, we still endure"
11065,BOOK XX.,"to see these deeds, while sheep are slaughtered and wine drunken and"
11066,BOOK XX.,"bread devoured, for hard it is for one man to restrain many. But come,"
11067,BOOK XX.,no longer work me harm out of an evil heart; but if ye be set on
11068,BOOK XX.,"slaying me, even me, with the sword, even that would I rather endure,"
11069,BOOK XX.,and far better would it be to die than to witness for ever these
11070,BOOK XX.,"unseemly deeds—strangers shamefully entreated, and men haling the"
11071,BOOK XX.,handmaidens in foul wise through the fair house.”
11072,BOOK XX.,
11073,BOOK XX.,"So he spake, and they were all hushed in silence. And late and at last"
11074,BOOK XX.,"spake among them Agelaus, son of Damastor:"
11075,BOOK XX.,
11076,BOOK XX.,"“Friends, when a righteous word has been spoken, none surely would"
11077,BOOK XX.,rebuke another with hard speech and be angry. Misuse ye not this
11078,BOOK XX.,"stranger, nor any of the thralls that are in the house of godlike"
11079,BOOK XX.,Odysseus. But to Telemachus himself I would speak a soft word and to
11080,BOOK XX.,"his mother, if perchance it may find favour with the mind of those"
11081,BOOK XX.,twain. So long as your hearts within you had hope of the wise Odysseus
11082,BOOK XX.,"returning to his own house, so long none could be wroth that ye waited"
11083,BOOK XX.,"and held back the wooers in the halls, for so had it been better, if"
11084,BOOK XX.,Odysseus had returned and come back to his own home. But now the event
11085,BOOK XX.,"is plain, that he will return no more. Go then, sit by thy mother and"
11086,BOOK XX.,"tell her all, namely, that she must wed the best man that wooes her,"
11087,BOOK XX.,and whose gives most gifts; so shalt thou with gladness live on the
11088,BOOK XX.,"heritage of thy father, eating and drinking, while she cares for"
11089,BOOK XX.,another’s house.”
11090,BOOK XX.,
11091,BOOK XX.,"Then wise Telemachus answered, and said: “Nay by Zeus, Agelaus, and by"
11092,BOOK XX.,"the griefs of my father, who far away methinks from Ithaca has perished"
11093,BOOK XX.,"or goes wandering, in nowise do I delay my mother’s marriage; nay, I"
11094,BOOK XX.,"bid her be married to what man she will, and withal I offer gifts"
11095,BOOK XX.,without number. But I do indeed feel shame to drive her forth from the
11096,BOOK XX.,"hall, despite her will, by a word of compulsion; God forbid that ever"
11097,BOOK XX.,this should be.”
11098,BOOK XX.,
11099,BOOK XX.,"So spake Telemachus, but among the wooers Pallas Athene roused laughter"
11100,BOOK XX.,"unquenchable, and drave their wits wandering. And now they were"
11101,BOOK XX.,"laughing with alien lips, and blood-bedabbled was the flesh they ate,"
11102,BOOK XX.,and their eyes were filled with tears and their soul was fain of
11103,BOOK XX.,lamentation. Then the godlike Theoclymenus spake among them:
11104,BOOK XX.,
11105,BOOK XX.,"“Ah, wretched men, what woe is this ye suffer? Shrouded in night are"
11106,BOOK XX.,"your heads and your faces and your knees, and kindled is the voice of"
11107,BOOK XX.,"wailing, and all cheeks are wet with tears, and the walls and the fair"
11108,BOOK XX.,"main-beams of the roof are sprinkled with blood. And the porch is full,"
11109,BOOK XX.,"and full is the court, of ghosts that hasten hellwards beneath the"
11110,BOOK XX.,"gloom, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an evil mist has"
11111,BOOK XX.,overspread the world.”
11112,BOOK XX.,
11113,BOOK XX.,"So spake he, and they all laughed sweetly at him. Then Eurymachus, son"
11114,BOOK XX.,"of Polybus, began to speak to them, saying:"
11115,BOOK XX.,
11116,BOOK XX.,“The guest that is newly come from a strange land is beside himself.
11117,BOOK XX.,"Quick, ye young men, and convey him forth out of doors, that he may go"
11118,BOOK XX.,"to the place of the gathering, since here he finds it dark as night.”"
11119,BOOK XX.,
11120,BOOK XX.,"Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Eurymachus, in nowise do I"
11121,BOOK XX.,"seek guides of thee to send me on my way. Eyes have I, and ears, and"
11122,BOOK XX.,"both my feet, and a stable mind in my breast of no mean fashioning."
11123,BOOK XX.,"With these I will go forth, for I see evil coming on you, which not one"
11124,BOOK XX.,"man of the wooers may avoid or shun, of all you who in the house of"
11125,BOOK XX.,divine Odysseus deal insolently with men and devise infatuate deeds.”
11126,BOOK XX.,
11127,BOOK XX.,"Therewith he went forth from out the fair-lying halls, and came to"
11128,BOOK XX.,"Peiraeus who received him gladly. Then all the wooers, looking one at"
11129,BOOK XX.,"the other, provoked Telemachus to anger, laughing at his guests. And"
11130,BOOK XX.,thus some one of the haughty youths would speak:
11131,BOOK XX.,
11132,BOOK XX.,"“Telemachus, no man is more luckless than thou in his guests, seeing"
11133,BOOK XX.,"thou keepest such a filthy wanderer, whosoever he be, always longing"
11134,BOOK XX.,"for bread and wine, and skilled in no peaceful work nor any deed of"
11135,BOOK XX.,"war, but a mere burden of the earth. And this other fellow again must"
11136,BOOK XX.,"stand up to play the seer! Nay, but if thou wouldest listen to me, much"
11137,BOOK XX.,"better it were. Let us cast these strangers on board a benched ship,"
11138,BOOK XX.,"and send them to the Sicilians, whence they would fetch thee their"
11139,BOOK XX.,price.”[35]
11140,BOOK XX.,
11141,BOOK XX.,"[35] Reading ἄλφοιν, which is a correction. Or keeping the MSS. ἄλφοι,"
11142,BOOK XX.,"“and this should bring thee in a goodly price,” the subject to ἄλφοι"
11143,BOOK XX.,"being, probably, _the sale_, which is suggested by the context."
11144,BOOK XX.,
11145,BOOK XX.,
11146,BOOK XX.,"So spake the wooers, but he heeded not their words, in silence he"
11147,BOOK XX.,"looked towards his father, expecting evermore the hour when he should"
11148,BOOK XX.,stretch forth his hands upon the shameless wooers.
11149,BOOK XX.,
11150,BOOK XX.,"Now the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had set her fair chair over"
11151,BOOK XX.,"against them, and heard the words of each one of the men in the halls."
11152,BOOK XX.,"For in the midst of laughter they had got ready the midday meal, a"
11153,BOOK XX.,"sweet meal and abundant, for they had sacrificed many cattle. But never"
11154,BOOK XX.,"could there be a banquet less gracious than that supper, such an one as"
11155,BOOK XX.,the goddess and the brave man were soon to spread for them; for that
11156,BOOK XX.,they had begun the devices of shame.
11157,BOOK XX.,
11158,BOOK XX.,
11159,BOOK XX.,
11160,BOOK XXI.,BOOK XXI.
11161,BOOK XXI.,
11162,BOOK XXI.,
11163,BOOK XXI.,"Penelope bringeth forth her husband’s bow, which the suitors could not"
11164,BOOK XXI.,"bend, but was bent by Odysseus."
11165,BOOK XXI.,
11166,BOOK XXI.,
11167,BOOK XXI.,"Now the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put it into the heart of the"
11168,BOOK XXI.,"daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to set the bow and the axes of grey"
11169,BOOK XXI.,"iron, for the wooers in the halls of Odysseus, to be the weapons of the"
11170,BOOK XXI.,"contest, and the beginning of death. So she descended the tall"
11171,BOOK XXI.,"staircase of her chamber, and took the well-bent key in her strong"
11172,BOOK XXI.,"hand, a goodly key of bronze, whereon was a handle of ivory. And she"
11173,BOOK XXI.,"betook her, with her handmaidens, to the treasure-chamber in the"
11174,BOOK XXI.,"uttermost part of the house, where lay the treasures of her lord,"
11175,BOOK XXI.,bronze and gold and well-wrought iron. And there lay the back-bent bow
11176,BOOK XXI.,"and the quiver for the arrows, and many shafts were therein, winged for"
11177,BOOK XXI.,"death, gifts of a friend of Odysseus, that met with him in Lacedaemon,"
11178,BOOK XXI.,"Iphitus son of Eurytus, a man like to the gods. These twain fell in"
11179,BOOK XXI.,"with one another in Messene, in the house of wise Ortilochus. Now"
11180,BOOK XXI.,Odysseus had gone thither to recover somewhat that was owing to him
11181,BOOK XXI.,"from all the people, for the men of Messene had lifted three hundred"
11182,BOOK XXI.,"sheep in benched ships from out of Ithaca, with the shepherds of the"
11183,BOOK XXI.,"flock. In quest of these it was that Odysseus went on a far embassy,"
11184,BOOK XXI.,being yet a lad; for his father and the other elders sent him forth.
11185,BOOK XXI.,"Moreover, Iphitus came thither in his search for twelve brood mares,"
11186,BOOK XXI.,"which he had lost, with sturdy mules at the teat. These same it was"
11187,BOOK XXI.,"that brought him death and destiny in the latter end, when he came to"
11188,BOOK XXI.,"the child of Zeus, hardy of heart, the man Heracles, that had knowledge"
11189,BOOK XXI.,"of great adventures, who smote Iphitus though his guest in his house,"
11190,BOOK XXI.,"in his frowardness, and had no regard for the vengeance of the gods,"
11191,BOOK XXI.,nor for the table which he spread before him; for after the meal he
11192,BOOK XXI.,"slew him, his guest though he was, and kept for himself in the halls"
11193,BOOK XXI.,"the horses strong of hoof. After these was Iphitus asking, when he met"
11194,BOOK XXI.,"with Odysseus, and he gave him the bow, which of old great Eurytus bare"
11195,BOOK XXI.,and had left at his death to his son in his lofty house. And Odysseus
11196,BOOK XXI.,"gave Iphitus a sharp sword and a mighty spear, for the beginning of a"
11197,BOOK XXI.,loving friendship; but never had they acquaintance one of another at
11198,BOOK XXI.,"the board; ere that might be, the son of Zeus slew Iphitus son of"
11199,BOOK XXI.,"Eurytus, a man like to the immortals, the same that gave Odysseus the"
11200,BOOK XXI.,bow. But goodly Odysseus would never take it with him on the black
11201,BOOK XXI.,"ships, as he went to the wars, but the bow was laid by at home in the"
11202,BOOK XXI.,"halls as a memorial of a dear guest, and he carried it on his own land."
11203,BOOK XXI.,
11204,BOOK XXI.,"Now when the fair lady had come even to the treasure-chamber, and had"
11205,BOOK XXI.,"stept upon the threshold of oak, which the carpenter had on a time"
11206,BOOK XXI.,"planed cunningly, and over it had made straight the line,—doorposts"
11207,BOOK XXI.,"also had he fitted thereby, whereon he set shining doors,—anon she"
11208,BOOK XXI.,"quickly loosed the strap from the handle of the door, and thrust in the"
11209,BOOK XXI.,"key, and with a straight aim shot back the bolts. And even as a bull"
11210,BOOK XXI.,"roars that is grazing in a meadow, so mightily roared the fair doors"
11211,BOOK XXI.,smitten by the key; and speedily they flew open before her. Then she
11212,BOOK XXI.,"stept on to the high floor, where the coffers stood, wherein the"
11213,BOOK XXI.,"fragrant raiment was stored. Thence she stretched forth her hand, and"
11214,BOOK XXI.,"took the bow from off the pin, all in the bright case which sheathed it"
11215,BOOK XXI.,"around. And there she sat down, and set the case upon her knees, and"
11216,BOOK XXI.,"cried aloud and wept, and took out the bow of her lord. Now when she"
11217,BOOK XXI.,"had her fill of tearful lament, she set forth to go to the hall to the"
11218,BOOK XXI.,"company of the proud wooers, with the back-bent bow in her hands, and"
11219,BOOK XXI.,"the quiver for the arrows, and many shafts were therein winged for"
11220,BOOK XXI.,"death. And her maidens along with her bare a chest, wherein lay much"
11221,BOOK XXI.,"store of iron and bronze, the gear of combat of their lord. Now when"
11222,BOOK XXI.,"the fair lady had come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the"
11223,BOOK XXI.,"well-builded roof, holding up her glistening tire before her face; and"
11224,BOOK XXI.,"a faithful maiden stood on either side of her, and straightway she"
11225,BOOK XXI.,"spake out among the wooers and declared her word, saying:"
11226,BOOK XXI.,
11227,BOOK XXI.,"“Hear me, ye lordly wooers, who have vexed this house, that ye might"
11228,BOOK XXI.,"eat and drink here evermore, forasmuch as the master is long gone, nor"
11229,BOOK XXI.,"could ye find any other mark[36] for your speech, but all your desire"
11230,BOOK XXI.,"was to wed me and take me to wife. Nay come now, ye wooers, seeing that"
11231,BOOK XXI.,this is the prize that is put before you. I will set forth for you the
11232,BOOK XXI.,"great bow of divine Odysseus, and whoso shall most easily string the"
11233,BOOK XXI.,"bow in his hands, and shoot through all twelve axes, with him will I go"
11234,BOOK XXI.,"and forsake this house, this house of my wedlock, so fair and filled"
11235,BOOK XXI.,"with all livelihood, which methinks I shall yet remember, aye, in a"
11236,BOOK XXI.,dream.”
11237,BOOK XXI.,
11238,BOOK XXI.,[36] The accepted interpretation of ἐπισχεσίη (a word which occurs
11239,BOOK XXI.,only here) is “pretext”; but this does not agree with any of the
11240,BOOK XXI.,meanings of the verb from which the noun is derived. The usage of
11241,BOOK XXI.,"ἐπέχω in Od. xix. 71, xxii. 75, of ἐπίσχειν in Il. xvii. 465, and of"
11242,BOOK XXI.,"ἐπισχόμενος in Od. xxii. 15, suggests rather for ἐπισχεσίη the idea of"
11243,BOOK XXI.,“aiming at a mark.”
11244,BOOK XXI.,
11245,BOOK XXI.,
11246,BOOK XXI.,"So spake she, and commanded Eumaeus, the goodly swineherd, to set the"
11247,BOOK XXI.,bow for the wooers and the axes of grey iron. And Eumaeus took them
11248,BOOK XXI.,"with tears, and laid them down; and otherwhere the neatherd wept, when"
11249,BOOK XXI.,"he beheld the bow of his lord. Then Antinous rebuked them, and spake"
11250,BOOK XXI.,and hailed them:
11251,BOOK XXI.,
11252,BOOK XXI.,"“Foolish boors, whose thoughts look not beyond the day, ah, wretched"
11253,BOOK XXI.,"pair, wherefore now do ye shed tears, and stir the soul of the lady"
11254,BOOK XXI.,"within her, when her heart already lies low in pain, for that she has"
11255,BOOK XXI.,"lost her dear lord? Nay sit, and feast in silence, or else get ye forth"
11256,BOOK XXI.,"and weep, and leave the bow here behind, to be a terrible contest for"
11257,BOOK XXI.,"the wooers, for methinks that this polished bow does not lightly yield"
11258,BOOK XXI.,itself to be strung. For there is no man among all these present such
11259,BOOK XXI.,"as Odysseus was, and I myself saw him, yea I remember it well, though I"
11260,BOOK XXI.,was still but a child.”
11261,BOOK XXI.,
11262,BOOK XXI.,"So spake he, but his heart within him hoped that he would string the"
11263,BOOK XXI.,"bow, and shoot through the iron. Yet verily, he was to be the first"
11264,BOOK XXI.,"that should taste the arrow at the hands of the noble Odysseus, whom"
11265,BOOK XXI.,"but late he was dishonouring as he sat in the halls, and was inciting"
11266,BOOK XXI.,all his fellows to do likewise.
11267,BOOK XXI.,
11268,BOOK XXI.,"Then the mighty prince Telemachus spake among them, saying: “Lo now, in"
11269,BOOK XXI.,"very truth, Cronion has robbed me of my wits! My dear mother, wise as"
11270,BOOK XXI.,"she is, declares that she will go with a stranger and forsake this"
11271,BOOK XXI.,"house; yet I laugh and in my silly heart I am glad. Nay come now, ye"
11272,BOOK XXI.,"wooers, seeing that this is the prize which is set before you, a lady,"
11273,BOOK XXI.,"the like of whom there is not now in the Achaean land, neither in"
11274,BOOK XXI.,"sacred Pylos, nor in Argos, nor in Mycenae, nor yet in Ithaca, nor in"
11275,BOOK XXI.,"the dark mainland. Nay but ye know all this yourselves,—why need I"
11276,BOOK XXI.,"praise my mother? Come therefore, delay not the issue with excuses, nor"
11277,BOOK XXI.,"hold much longer aloof from the drawing of the bow, that we may see the"
11278,BOOK XXI.,thing that is to be. Yea and I myself would make trial of this bow. If
11279,BOOK XXI.,"I shall string it, and shoot through the iron, then should I not sorrow"
11280,BOOK XXI.,"if my lady mother were to quit these halls and go with a stranger,"
11281,BOOK XXI.,"seeing that I should be left behind, well able now to lift my father’s"
11282,BOOK XXI.,goodly gear of combat.”
11283,BOOK XXI.,
11284,BOOK XXI.,"Therewith he cast from off his neck his cloak of scarlet, and sprang to"
11285,BOOK XXI.,"his full height, and put away the sword from his shoulders. First he"
11286,BOOK XXI.,"dug a good trench and set up the axes, one long trench for them all,"
11287,BOOK XXI.,and over it he made straight the line and round about stamped in the
11288,BOOK XXI.,earth. And amazement fell on all that beheld how orderly he set the
11289,BOOK XXI.,"axes, though never before had he seen it so. Then he went and stood by"
11290,BOOK XXI.,the threshold and began to prove the bow. Thrice he made it to tremble
11291,BOOK XXI.,"in his great desire to draw it, and thrice he rested from his effort,"
11292,BOOK XXI.,"though still he hoped in his heart to string the bow, and shoot through"
11293,BOOK XXI.,"the iron. And now at last he might have strung it, mightily straining"
11294,BOOK XXI.,"thereat for the fourth time, but Odysseus nodded frowning and stayed"
11295,BOOK XXI.,"him, for all his eagerness. Then the strong prince Telemachus spake"
11296,BOOK XXI.,among them again:
11297,BOOK XXI.,
11298,BOOK XXI.,"“Lo you now, even to the end of my days I shall be a coward and a"
11299,BOOK XXI.,"weakling, or it may be I am too young, and have as yet no trust in my"
11300,BOOK XXI.,hands to defend me from such an one as does violence without a cause.
11301,BOOK XXI.,"But come now, ye who are mightier men than I, essay the bow and let us"
11302,BOOK XXI.,make an end of the contest.”
11303,BOOK XXI.,
11304,BOOK XXI.,"Therewith he put the bow from him on the ground, leaning it against the"
11305,BOOK XXI.,"smooth and well-compacted doors, and the swift shaft he propped hard by"
11306,BOOK XXI.,"against the fair bow-tip, and then he sat down once more on the high"
11307,BOOK XXI.,"seat, whence he had risen."
11308,BOOK XXI.,
11309,BOOK XXI.,"Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake among them, saying: “Rise up in"
11310,BOOK XXI.,"order, all my friends, beginning from the left, even from the place"
11311,BOOK XXI.,whence the wine is poured.”
11312,BOOK XXI.,
11313,BOOK XXI.,"So spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then first stood"
11314,BOOK XXI.,"up Leiodes, son of Oenops, who was their soothsayer and ever sat by the"
11315,BOOK XXI.,fair mixing bowl at the extremity of the hall; he alone hated their
11316,BOOK XXI.,infatuate deeds and was indignant with all the wooers. He now first
11317,BOOK XXI.,"took the bow and the swift shaft, and he went and stood by the"
11318,BOOK XXI.,"threshold, and began to prove the bow; but he could not bend it; or"
11319,BOOK XXI.,"ever that might be, his hands grew weary with the straining, his"
11320,BOOK XXI.,"unworn, delicate hands; so he spake among the wooers, saying:"
11321,BOOK XXI.,
11322,BOOK XXI.,"“Friends, of a truth I cannot bend it, let some other take it. Ah, many"
11323,BOOK XXI.,"of our bravest shall this bow rob of spirit and of life, since truly it"
11324,BOOK XXI.,"is far better for us to die, than to live on and to fail of that for"
11325,BOOK XXI.,"which we assemble evermore in this place, day by day expecting the"
11326,BOOK XXI.,prize. Many there be even now that hope in their hearts and desire to
11327,BOOK XXI.,"wed Penelope, the bedfellow of Odysseus: but when such an one shall"
11328,BOOK XXI.,"make trial of the bow and see the issue, thereafter let him woo some"
11329,BOOK XXI.,other fair-robed Achaean woman with his bridal gifts and seek to win
11330,BOOK XXI.,"her. So may our lady wed the man that gives most gifts, and comes as"
11331,BOOK XXI.,the chosen of fate.”
11332,BOOK XXI.,
11333,BOOK XXI.,"So he spake, and put from him the bow leaning it against the smooth and"
11334,BOOK XXI.,"well-compacted doors, and the swift shaft he propped hard by against"
11335,BOOK XXI.,"the fair bow-tip, and then he sat down once more on the high seat,"
11336,BOOK XXI.,whence he had risen.
11337,BOOK XXI.,
11338,BOOK XXI.,"But Antinous rebuked him, and spake and hailed him: “Leiodes, what word"
11339,BOOK XXI.,"hath escaped the door of thy lips; a hard word, and a grievous? Nay, it"
11340,BOOK XXI.,"angers me to hear it, and to think that a bow such as this shall rob"
11341,BOOK XXI.,"our bravest of spirit and of life, and all because thou canst not draw"
11342,BOOK XXI.,it. For I tell thee that thy lady mother bare thee not of such might as
11343,BOOK XXI.,to draw a bow and shoot arrows: but there be others of the proud wooers
11344,BOOK XXI.,that shall draw it soon.”
11345,BOOK XXI.,
11346,BOOK XXI.,"So he spake, and commanded Melanthius, the goatherd, saying: “Up now,"
11347,BOOK XXI.,"light a fire in the halls, Melanthius; and place a great settle by the"
11348,BOOK XXI.,"fire and a fleece thereon, and bring forth a great ball of lard that is"
11349,BOOK XXI.,"within, that we young men may warm and anoint the bow therewith and"
11350,BOOK XXI.,"prove it, and make an end of the contest.”"
11351,BOOK XXI.,
11352,BOOK XXI.,"So he spake, and Melanthius soon kindled the never-resting fire, and"
11353,BOOK XXI.,"drew up a settle and placed it near, and put a fleece thereon, and he"
11354,BOOK XXI.,brought forth a great ball of lard that was within. Therewith the young
11355,BOOK XXI.,"men warmed the bow, and made essay, but could not string it, for they"
11356,BOOK XXI.,were greatly lacking of such might. And Antinous still held to the task
11357,BOOK XXI.,"and godlike Eurymachus, chief men among the wooers, who were far the"
11358,BOOK XXI.,most excellent of all.
11359,BOOK XXI.,
11360,BOOK XXI.,"But those other twain went forth both together from the house, the"
11361,BOOK XXI.,neatherd and the swineherd of godlike Odysseus; and Odysseus passed out
11362,BOOK XXI.,after them. But when they were now gotten without the gates and the
11363,BOOK XXI.,"courtyard, he uttered his voice and spake to them in gentle words:"
11364,BOOK XXI.,
11365,BOOK XXI.,"“Neatherd and thou swineherd, shall I say somewhat or keep it to"
11366,BOOK XXI.,"myself? Nay, my spirit bids me declare it. What manner of men would ye"
11367,BOOK XXI.,"be to help Odysseus, if he should come thus suddenly, I know not"
11368,BOOK XXI.,"whence, and some god were to bring him? Would ye stand on the side of"
11369,BOOK XXI.,the wooers or of Odysseus? Tell me even as your heart and spirit bid
11370,BOOK XXI.,you.”
11371,BOOK XXI.,
11372,BOOK XXI.,"Then the neatherd answered him, saying: “Father Zeus, if but thou"
11373,BOOK XXI.,"wouldst fulfil this wish:[37]—oh, that that man might come, and some"
11374,BOOK XXI.,"god lead him hither! So shouldest thou know what my might is, and how"
11375,BOOK XXI.,my hands follow to obey.”
11376,BOOK XXI.,
11377,BOOK XXI.,[37] Placing a colon at ἐέλδωρ.
11378,BOOK XXI.,
11379,BOOK XXI.,
11380,BOOK XXI.,In like manner Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that wise Odysseus might
11381,BOOK XXI.,return to his own home.
11382,BOOK XXI.,
11383,BOOK XXI.,"Now when he knew for a surety what spirit they were of, once more he"
11384,BOOK XXI.,"answered and spake to them, saying:"
11385,BOOK XXI.,
11386,BOOK XXI.,"“Behold, home am I come, even I; after much travail and sore am I come"
11387,BOOK XXI.,in the twentieth year to mine own country. And I know how that my
11388,BOOK XXI.,"coming is desired by you alone of all my thralls, for from none besides"
11389,BOOK XXI.,have I heard a prayer that I might return once more to my home. And now
11390,BOOK XXI.,"I will tell you all the truth, even as it shall come to pass. If the"
11391,BOOK XXI.,"god shall subdue the proud wooers to my hands, I will bring you each"
11392,BOOK XXI.,"one a wife, and will give you a heritage of your own and a house"
11393,BOOK XXI.,"builded near to me, and ye twain shall be thereafter in mine eyes as"
11394,BOOK XXI.,"the brethren and companions of Telemachus. But behold, I will likewise"
11395,BOOK XXI.,"show you a most manifest token, that ye may know me well and be"
11396,BOOK XXI.,"certified in heart, even the wound that the boar dealt me with his"
11397,BOOK XXI.,"white tusk long ago, when I went to Parnassus with the sons of"
11398,BOOK XXI.,Autolycus.”
11399,BOOK XXI.,
11400,BOOK XXI.,Therewith he drew aside the rags from the great scar. And when the
11401,BOOK XXI.,"twain had beheld it and marked it well, they cast their arms about the"
11402,BOOK XXI.,"wise Odysseus, and fell a weeping; and kissed him lovingly on head and"
11403,BOOK XXI.,shoulders. And in like manner Odysseus too kissed their heads and
11404,BOOK XXI.,"hands. And now would the sunlight have gone down upon their sorrowing,"
11405,BOOK XXI.,had not Odysseus himself stayed them saying:
11406,BOOK XXI.,
11407,BOOK XXI.,"“Cease ye from weeping and lamentation, lest some one come forth from"
11408,BOOK XXI.,"the hall and see us, and tell it likewise in the house. Nay, go ye"
11409,BOOK XXI.,"within one by one and not both together, I first and you following, and"
11410,BOOK XXI.,"let this be the token between us. All the rest, as many as are proud"
11411,BOOK XXI.,"wooers, will not suffer that I should be given the bow and quiver; do"
11412,BOOK XXI.,"thou then, goodly Eumaeus, as thou bearest the bow through the hall,"
11413,BOOK XXI.,set it in my hands and speak to the women that they bar the
11414,BOOK XXI.,well-fitting doors of their chamber. And if any of them hear the sound
11415,BOOK XXI.,"of groaning or the din of men within our walls, let them not run forth"
11416,BOOK XXI.,"but abide where they are in silence at their work. But on thee, goodly"
11417,BOOK XXI.,"Philoetius, I lay this charge, to bolt and bar the outer gate of the"
11418,BOOK XXI.,court and swiftly to tie the knot.”
11419,BOOK XXI.,
11420,BOOK XXI.,"Therewith he passed within the fair-lying halls, and went and sat upon"
11421,BOOK XXI.,the settle whence he had risen. And likewise the two thralls of divine
11422,BOOK XXI.,Odysseus went within.
11423,BOOK XXI.,
11424,BOOK XXI.,"And now Eurymachus was handling the bow, warming it on this side and on"
11425,BOOK XXI.,"that at the light of the fire; yet even so he could not string it, and"
11426,BOOK XXI.,in his great heart he groaned mightily; and in heaviness of spirit he
11427,BOOK XXI.,"spake and called aloud, saying:"
11428,BOOK XXI.,
11429,BOOK XXI.,"“Lo you now, truly am I grieved for myself and for you all! Not for the"
11430,BOOK XXI.,"marriage do I mourn so greatly, afflicted though I be; there are many"
11431,BOOK XXI.,"Achaean women besides, some in sea-begirt Ithaca itself and some in"
11432,BOOK XXI.,"other cities. Nay, but I grieve, if indeed we are so far worse than"
11433,BOOK XXI.,"godlike Odysseus in might, seeing that we cannot bend the bow. It will"
11434,BOOK XXI.,be a shame even for men unborn to hear thereof.”
11435,BOOK XXI.,
11436,BOOK XXI.,"Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Eurymachus, this shall"
11437,BOOK XXI.,"not be so, and thou thyself too knowest it. For to-day the feast of the"
11438,BOOK XXI.,"archer god is held in the land, a holy feast. Who at such a time would"
11439,BOOK XXI.,"be bending bows? Nay, set it quietly by; what and if we should let the"
11440,BOOK XXI.,axes all stand as they are? None methinks will come to the hall of
11441,BOOK XXI.,"Odysseus, son of Laertes, and carry them away. Go to now, let the"
11442,BOOK XXI.,"wine-bearer pour for libation into each cup in turn, that after the"
11443,BOOK XXI.,drink-offering we may set down the curved bow. And in the morning bid
11444,BOOK XXI.,"Melanthius, the goatherd, to lead hither the very best goats in all his"
11445,BOOK XXI.,"herds, that we may lay pieces of the thighs on the altar of Apollo the"
11446,BOOK XXI.,"archer, and assay the bow and make an end of the contest.”"
11447,BOOK XXI.,
11448,BOOK XXI.,"So spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then the henchmen"
11449,BOOK XXI.,"poured water on their hands, and pages crowned the mixing-bowls with"
11450,BOOK XXI.,"drink, and served out the wine to all, when they had poured for"
11451,BOOK XXI.,libation into each cup in turn. But when they had poured forth and had
11452,BOOK XXI.,"drunken to their hearts’ desire, Odysseus of many counsels spake among"
11453,BOOK XXI.,"them out of a crafty heart, saying:"
11454,BOOK XXI.,
11455,BOOK XXI.,"“Hear me, ye wooers of the renowned queen, that I may say that which my"
11456,BOOK XXI.,heart within me bids. And mainly to Eurymachus I make my prayer and to
11457,BOOK XXI.,"the godlike Antinous, forasmuch as he has spoken even this word aright,"
11458,BOOK XXI.,"namely, that for this present ye cease from your archery and leave the"
11459,BOOK XXI.,issue to the gods; and in the morning the god will give the victory to
11460,BOOK XXI.,"whomsoever he will. Come therefore, give me the polished bow, that in"
11461,BOOK XXI.,"your presence I may prove my hands and strength, whether I have yet any"
11462,BOOK XXI.,"force such as once was in my supple limbs, or whether my wanderings and"
11463,BOOK XXI.,needy fare have even now destroyed it.”
11464,BOOK XXI.,
11465,BOOK XXI.,"So spake he and they all were exceeding wroth, for fear lest he should"
11466,BOOK XXI.,"string the polished bow. And Antinous rebuked him, and spake and hailed"
11467,BOOK XXI.,him:
11468,BOOK XXI.,
11469,BOOK XXI.,"“Wretched stranger, thou hast no wit, nay never so little. Art thou not"
11470,BOOK XXI.,"content to feast at ease in our high company, and to lack not thy share"
11471,BOOK XXI.,"of the banquet, but to listen to our speech and our discourse, while no"
11472,BOOK XXI.,guest and beggar beside thee hears our speech? Wine it is that wounds
11473,BOOK XXI.,"thee, honey sweet wine, that is the bane of others too, even of all who"
11474,BOOK XXI.,take great draughts and drink out of measure. Wine it was that darkened
11475,BOOK XXI.,"the mind even of the Centaur, renowned Eurytion, in the hall of"
11476,BOOK XXI.,"high-hearted Peirithous, when he went to the Lapithae; and after that"
11477,BOOK XXI.,"his heart was darkened with wine, he wrought foul deeds in his frenzy,"
11478,BOOK XXI.,"in the house of Peirithous. Then wrath fell on all the heroes, and they"
11479,BOOK XXI.,"leaped up and dragged him forth through the porch, when they had shorn"
11480,BOOK XXI.,"off his ears and nostrils with the pitiless sword, and then with"
11481,BOOK XXI.,darkened mind he bare about with him the burden of his sin in
11482,BOOK XXI.,foolishness of heart. Thence was the feud begun between the Centaurs
11483,BOOK XXI.,"and mankind; but first for himself gat he hurt, being heavy with wine."
11484,BOOK XXI.,And even so I declare great mischief unto thee if thou shalt string the
11485,BOOK XXI.,"bow, for thou shalt find no courtesy at the hand of anyone in our land,"
11486,BOOK XXI.,"and anon we will send thee in a black ship to Echetus, the maimer of"
11487,BOOK XXI.,"all men, and thence thou shalt not be saved alive. Nay then, drink at"
11488,BOOK XXI.,"thine ease, and strive not still with men that are younger than thou.”"
11489,BOOK XXI.,
11490,BOOK XXI.,"Then wise Penelope answered him: “Antinous, truly it is not fair nor"
11491,BOOK XXI.,"just to rob the guests of Telemachus of their due, whosoever he may be"
11492,BOOK XXI.,that comes to this house. Dost thou think if yonder stranger strings
11493,BOOK XXI.,"the great bow of Odysseus, in the pride of his might and of his"
11494,BOOK XXI.,"strength of arm, that he will lead me to his home and make me his wife?"
11495,BOOK XXI.,"Nay he himself, methinks, has no such hope in his breast; so, as for"
11496,BOOK XXI.,"that, let not any of you fret himself while feasting in this place;"
11497,BOOK XXI.,that were indeed unmeet.”
11498,BOOK XXI.,
11499,BOOK XXI.,"Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her, saying: “Daughter of"
11500,BOOK XXI.,"Icarius, wise Penelope, it is not that we deem that he will lead thee"
11501,BOOK XXI.,"to his home,—far be such a thought from us,—but we dread the speech of"
11502,BOOK XXI.,"men and women, lest some day one of the baser sort among the Achaeans"
11503,BOOK XXI.,"say: ‘Truly men far too mean are wooing the wife of one that is noble,"
11504,BOOK XXI.,nor can they string the polished bow. But a stranger and a beggar came
11505,BOOK XXI.,"in his wanderings, and lightly strung the bow, and shot through the"
11506,BOOK XXI.,"iron.’ Thus will they speak, and this will turn to our reproach.”"
11507,BOOK XXI.,
11508,BOOK XXI.,"Then wise Penelope answered him: “Eurymachus, never can there be fair"
11509,BOOK XXI.,fame in the land for those that devour and dishonour the house of a
11510,BOOK XXI.,"prince, but why make ye this thing into a reproach? But, behold, our"
11511,BOOK XXI.,"guest is great of growth and well-knit, and avows him to be born the"
11512,BOOK XXI.,"son of a good father. Come then, give ye him the polished bow, that we"
11513,BOOK XXI.,"may see that which is to be. For thus will I declare my saying, and it"
11514,BOOK XXI.,shall surely come to pass. If he shall string the bow and Apollo grant
11515,BOOK XXI.,"him renown, I will clothe him in a mantle and a doublet, goodly"
11516,BOOK XXI.,"raiment, and I will give him a sharp javelin to defend him against dogs"
11517,BOOK XXI.,"and men, and a two-edged sword and sandals to bind beneath his feet,"
11518,BOOK XXI.,and I will send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go.”
11519,BOOK XXI.,
11520,BOOK XXI.,"Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: “My mother, as for the bow,"
11521,BOOK XXI.,"no Achaean is mightier than I to give or to deny it to whomso I will,"
11522,BOOK XXI.,neither as many as are lords in rocky Ithaca nor in the isles on the
11523,BOOK XXI.,"side of Elis, the pastureland of horses. Not one of these shall force"
11524,BOOK XXI.,"me in mine own despite, if I choose to give this bow, yea once and for"
11525,BOOK XXI.,"all, to the stranger to bear away with him. But do thou go to thine own"
11526,BOOK XXI.,"chamber and mind thine own housewiferies, the loom and distaff, and bid"
11527,BOOK XXI.,"thine handmaids ply their tasks. But the bow shall be for men, for all,"
11528,BOOK XXI.,"but for me in chief, for mine is the lordship in the house.”"
11529,BOOK XXI.,
11530,BOOK XXI.,"Then in amaze she went back to her chamber, for she laid up the wise"
11531,BOOK XXI.,saying of her son in her heart. She ascended to her upper chamber with
11532,BOOK XXI.,"the women her handmaids, and then was bewailing Odysseus, her dear"
11533,BOOK XXI.,"lord, till grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids."
11534,BOOK XXI.,
11535,BOOK XXI.,"Now the goodly swineherd had taken the curved bow, and was bearing it,"
11536,BOOK XXI.,when the wooers all cried out upon him in the halls. And thus some one
11537,BOOK XXI.,of the haughty youths would speak: “Whither now art thou bearing the
11538,BOOK XXI.,"curved bow, thou wretched swineherd, crazed in thy wits? Lo, soon shall"
11539,BOOK XXI.,"the swift hounds of thine own breeding eat thee hard by thy swine,"
11540,BOOK XXI.,"alone and away from men, if Apollo will be gracious to us and the other"
11541,BOOK XXI.,deathless gods.”
11542,BOOK XXI.,
11543,BOOK XXI.,"Even so they spake, and he took and set down the bow in that very"
11544,BOOK XXI.,"place, being affrighted because many cried out on him in the halls."
11545,BOOK XXI.,"Then Telemachus from the other side spake threateningly, and called"
11546,BOOK XXI.,aloud:
11547,BOOK XXI.,
11548,BOOK XXI.,"“Father, bring hither the bow, soon shalt thou rue it that thou servest"
11549,BOOK XXI.,"many masters. Take heed, lest I that am younger than thou pursue thee"
11550,BOOK XXI.,"to the field, and pelt thee with stones, for in might I am the better."
11551,BOOK XXI.,If only I were so much mightier in strength of arm than all the wooers
11552,BOOK XXI.,"that are in the halls, soon would I send many an one forth on a woeful"
11553,BOOK XXI.,"way from out our house, for they imagine mischief against us.”"
11554,BOOK XXI.,
11555,BOOK XXI.,"So he spake, and all the wooers laughed sweetly at him, and ceased now"
11556,BOOK XXI.,from their cruel anger toward Telemachus. Then the swineherd bare the
11557,BOOK XXI.,"bow through the hall, and went up to wise Odysseus, and set it in his"
11558,BOOK XXI.,hands. And he called forth the nurse Eurycleia from the chamber and
11559,BOOK XXI.,spake to her:
11560,BOOK XXI.,
11561,BOOK XXI.,"“Wise Eurycleia, Telemachus bids thee bar the well-fitting doors of thy"
11562,BOOK XXI.,"chamber, and if any of the women hear the sound of groaning or the din"
11563,BOOK XXI.,"of men within our walls, let them not go forth, but abide where they"
11564,BOOK XXI.,are in silence at their work.”
11565,BOOK XXI.,
11566,BOOK XXI.,"So he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she barred the doors"
11567,BOOK XXI.,of the fair-lying chambers.
11568,BOOK XXI.,
11569,BOOK XXI.,"Then Philoetius hasted forth silently from the house, and barred the"
11570,BOOK XXI.,outer gates of the fenced court. Now there lay beneath the gallery the
11571,BOOK XXI.,"cable of a curved ship, fashioned of the byblus plant, wherewith he"
11572,BOOK XXI.,"made fast the gates, and then himself passed within. Then he went and"
11573,BOOK XXI.,"sat on the settle whence he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus. He"
11574,BOOK XXI.,"already was handling the bow, turning it every way about, and proving"
11575,BOOK XXI.,"it on this side and on that, lest the worms might have eaten the horns"
11576,BOOK XXI.,when the lord of the bow was away. And thus men spake looking each one
11577,BOOK XXI.,to his neighbour:
11578,BOOK XXI.,
11579,BOOK XXI.,"“Verily he has a good eye, and a shrewd turn for a bow! Either,"
11580,BOOK XXI.,"methinks, he himself has such a bow lying by at home or else he is set"
11581,BOOK XXI.,"on making one, in such wise does he turn it hither and thither in his"
11582,BOOK XXI.,"hands, this evil-witted beggar.”"
11583,BOOK XXI.,
11584,BOOK XXI.,And another again of the haughty youths would say: “Would that the
11585,BOOK XXI.,"fellow may have profit thereof, just so surely as he shall ever prevail"
11586,BOOK XXI.,to bend this bow!”
11587,BOOK XXI.,
11588,BOOK XXI.,"So spake the wooers, but Odysseus of many counsels had lifted the great"
11589,BOOK XXI.,"bow and viewed it on every side, and even as when a man that is skilled"
11590,BOOK XXI.,"in the lyre and in minstrelsy, easily stretches a cord about a new peg,"
11591,BOOK XXI.,"after tying at either end the twisted sheep-gut, even so Odysseus"
11592,BOOK XXI.,"straightway bent the great bow, all without effort, and took it in his"
11593,BOOK XXI.,"right hand and proved the bow-string, which rang sweetly at the touch,"
11594,BOOK XXI.,"in tone like a swallow. Then great grief came upon the wooers, and the"
11595,BOOK XXI.,"colour of their countenance was changed, and Zeus thundered loud"
11596,BOOK XXI.,showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad
11597,BOOK XXI.,"thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos had sent him a"
11598,BOOK XXI.,"sign. Then he caught up a swift arrow which lay by his table, bare, but"
11599,BOOK XXI.,"the other shafts were stored within the hollow quiver, those whereof"
11600,BOOK XXI.,the Achaeans were soon to taste. He took and laid it on the bridge of
11601,BOOK XXI.,"the bow, and held the notch and drew the string, even from the settle"
11602,BOOK XXI.,"whereon he sat, and with straight aim shot the shaft and missed not one"
11603,BOOK XXI.,"of the axes, beginning from the first axe-handle, and the"
11604,BOOK XXI.,bronze-weighted shaft passed clean through and out at the last. Then he
11605,BOOK XXI.,"spake to Telemachus, saying:"
11606,BOOK XXI.,
11607,BOOK XXI.,"“Telemachus, thy guest that sits in the halls does thee no shame. In"
11608,BOOK XXI.,"nowise did I miss my mark, nor was I wearied with long bending of the"
11609,BOOK XXI.,bow. Still is my might steadfast—not as the wooers say scornfully to
11610,BOOK XXI.,slight me. But now is it time that supper too be got ready for the
11611,BOOK XXI.,"Achaeans, while it is yet light, and thereafter must we make other"
11612,BOOK XXI.,"sport with the dance and the lyre, for these are the crown of the"
11613,BOOK XXI.,feast.”
11614,BOOK XXI.,
11615,BOOK XXI.,"Therewith he nodded with bent brows, and Telemachus, the dear son of"
11616,BOOK XXI.,"divine Odysseus, girt his sharp sword about him and took the spear in"
11617,BOOK XXI.,"his grasp, and stood by his high seat at his father’s side, armed with"
11618,BOOK XXI.,the gleaming bronze.
11619,BOOK XXI.,
11620,BOOK XXI.,
11621,BOOK XXI.,
11622,BOOK XXII.,BOOK XXII.
11623,BOOK XXII.,
11624,BOOK XXII.,
11625,BOOK XXII.,The killing of the wooers.
11626,BOOK XXII.,
11627,BOOK XXII.,
11628,BOOK XXII.,Then Odysseus of many counsels stripped him of his rags and leaped on
11629,BOOK XXII.,"to the great threshold with his bow and quiver full of arrows, and"
11630,BOOK XXII.,"poured forth all the swift shafts there before his feet, and spake"
11631,BOOK XXII.,among the wooers:
11632,BOOK XXII.,
11633,BOOK XXII.,"“Lo, now is this terrible trial ended at last; and now will I know of"
11634,BOOK XXII.,"another mark, which never yet man has smitten, if perchance I may hit"
11635,BOOK XXII.,it and Apollo grant me renown.”
11636,BOOK XXII.,
11637,BOOK XXII.,With that he pointed the bitter arrow at Antinous. Now he was about
11638,BOOK XXII.,"raising to his lips a fair twy-eared chalice of gold, and behold, he"
11639,BOOK XXII.,"was handling it to drink of the wine, and death was far from his"
11640,BOOK XXII.,thoughts. For who among men at feast would deem that one man amongst so
11641,BOOK XXII.,"many, how hardy soever he were, would bring on him foul death and black"
11642,BOOK XXII.,"fate? But Odysseus aimed and smote him with the arrow in the throat,"
11643,BOOK XXII.,"and the point passed clean out through his delicate neck, and he fell"
11644,BOOK XXII.,"sidelong and the cup dropped from his hand as he was smitten, and at"
11645,BOOK XXII.,once through his nostrils there came up a thick jet of slain man’s
11646,BOOK XXII.,"blood, and quickly he spurned the table from him with his foot, and"
11647,BOOK XXII.,"spilt the food on the ground, and the bread and the roast flesh were"
11648,BOOK XXII.,defiled. Then the wooers raised a clamour through the halls when they
11649,BOOK XXII.,"saw the man fallen, and they leaped from their high seats, as men"
11650,BOOK XXII.,"stirred by fear, all through the hall, peering everywhere along the"
11651,BOOK XXII.,"well-builded walls, and nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to"
11652,BOOK XXII.,lay hold on. Then they reviled Odysseus with angry words:
11653,BOOK XXII.,
11654,BOOK XXII.,"“Stranger, thou shootest at men to thy hurt. Never again shalt thou"
11655,BOOK XXII.,"enter other lists, now is utter doom assured thee. Yea, for now hast"
11656,BOOK XXII.,thou slain the man that was far the best of all the noble youths in
11657,BOOK XXII.,Ithaca; wherefore vultures shall devour thee here.”
11658,BOOK XXII.,
11659,BOOK XXII.,"So each one spake, for indeed they thought that Odysseus had not slain"
11660,BOOK XXII.,"him wilfully; but they knew not in their folly that on their own heads,"
11661,BOOK XXII.,"each and all of them, the bands of death had been made fast. Then"
11662,BOOK XXII.,"Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on them, and spake:"
11663,BOOK XXII.,
11664,BOOK XXII.,"“Ye dogs, ye said in your hearts that I should never more come home"
11665,BOOK XXII.,"from the land of the Trojans, in that ye wasted my house, and lay with"
11666,BOOK XXII.,"the maidservants by force, and traitorously wooed my wife while I was"
11667,BOOK XXII.,"yet alive, and ye had no fear of the gods, that hold the wide heaven,"
11668,BOOK XXII.,nor of the indignation of men hereafter. But now the bands of death
11669,BOOK XXII.,have been made fast upon you one and all.”
11670,BOOK XXII.,
11671,BOOK XXII.,"Even so he spake, and pale fear gat hold on the limbs of all, and each"
11672,BOOK XXII.,"man looked about, where he might shun utter doom. And Eurymachus alone"
11673,BOOK XXII.,"answered him, and spake: “If thou art indeed Odysseus of Ithaca, come"
11674,BOOK XXII.,"home again, with right thou speakest thus, of all that the Achaeans"
11675,BOOK XXII.,"have wrought, many infatuate deeds in thy halls and many in the field."
11676,BOOK XXII.,"Howbeit, he now lies dead that is to blame for all, Antinous; for he"
11677,BOOK XXII.,"brought all these things upon us, not as longing very greatly for the"
11678,BOOK XXII.,"marriage nor needing it sore, but with another purpose, that Cronion"
11679,BOOK XXII.,"has not fulfilled for him, namely, that he might himself be king over"
11680,BOOK XXII.,"all the land of stablished Ithaca, and he was to have lain in wait for"
11681,BOOK XXII.,"thy son and killed him. But now he is slain after his deserving, and do"
11682,BOOK XXII.,"thou spare thy people, even thine own; and we will hereafter go about"
11683,BOOK XXII.,the township and yield thee amends for all that has been eaten and
11684,BOOK XXII.,"drunken in thy halls, each for himself bringing atonement of twenty"
11685,BOOK XXII.,"oxen worth, and requiting thee in gold and bronze till thy heart is"
11686,BOOK XXII.,"softened, but till then none may blame thee that thou art angry.”"
11687,BOOK XXII.,
11688,BOOK XXII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him, and said:"
11689,BOOK XXII.,"“Eurymachus, not even if ye gave me all your heritage, all that ye now"
11690,BOOK XXII.,"have, and whatsoever else ye might in any wise add thereto, not even so"
11691,BOOK XXII.,"would I henceforth hold my hands from slaying, ere the wooers had paid"
11692,BOOK XXII.,"for all their transgressions. And now the choice lies before you,"
11693,BOOK XXII.,"whether to fight in fair battle or to fly, if any may avoid death and"
11694,BOOK XXII.,"the fates. But there be some, methinks, that shall not escape from"
11695,BOOK XXII.,utter doom.”
11696,BOOK XXII.,
11697,BOOK XXII.,"He spake, and their knees were straightway loosened and their hearts"
11698,BOOK XXII.,melted within them. And Eurymachus spake among them yet again:
11699,BOOK XXII.,
11700,BOOK XXII.,"“Friends, it is plain that this man will not hold his unconquerable"
11701,BOOK XXII.,"hands, but now that he has caught up the polished bow and quiver, he"
11702,BOOK XXII.,"will shoot from the smooth threshold, till he has slain us all;"
11703,BOOK XXII.,wherefore let us take thought for the delight of battle. Draw your
11704,BOOK XXII.,"blades, and hold up the tables to ward off the arrows of swift death,"
11705,BOOK XXII.,"and let us all have at him with one accord, and drive him, if it may"
11706,BOOK XXII.,"be, from the threshold and the doorway and then go through the city,"
11707,BOOK XXII.,and quickly would the cry be raised. Thereby should this man soon have
11708,BOOK XXII.,shot his latest bolt.”
11709,BOOK XXII.,
11710,BOOK XXII.,"Therewith he drew his sharp two-edged sword of bronze, and leapt on"
11711,BOOK XXII.,"Odysseus with a terrible cry, but in the same moment goodly Odysseus"
11712,BOOK XXII.,"shot the arrow forth and struck him on the breast by the pap, and drave"
11713,BOOK XXII.,"the swift shaft into his liver. So he let the sword fall from his hand,"
11714,BOOK XXII.,"and grovelling over the table he bowed and fell, and spilt the food and"
11715,BOOK XXII.,the two-handled cup on the floor. And in his agony he smote the ground
11716,BOOK XXII.,"with his brow, and spurning with both his feet he overthrew the high"
11717,BOOK XXII.,"seat, and the mist of death was shed upon his eyes."
11718,BOOK XXII.,
11719,BOOK XXII.,"Then Amphinomus made at renowned Odysseus, setting straight at him, and"
11720,BOOK XXII.,"drew his sharp sword, if perchance he might make him give ground from"
11721,BOOK XXII.,"the door. But Telemachus was beforehand with him, and cast and smote"
11722,BOOK XXII.,"him from behind with a bronze-shod spear between the shoulders, and"
11723,BOOK XXII.,"drave it out through the breast, and he fell with a crash and struck"
11724,BOOK XXII.,"the ground full with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away, leaving"
11725,BOOK XXII.,"the long spear fixed in Amphinomus, for he greatly dreaded lest one of"
11726,BOOK XXII.,"the Achaeans might run upon him with his blade, and stab him as he drew"
11727,BOOK XXII.,"forth the spear, or smite him with a down stroke[38] of the sword. So"
11728,BOOK XXII.,"he started and ran and came quickly to his father, and stood by him,"
11729,BOOK XXII.,and spake winged words:
11730,BOOK XXII.,
11731,BOOK XXII.,"[38] Or, reading προπρηνέα, smite him as he stooped over the corpse."
11732,BOOK XXII.,
11733,BOOK XXII.,
11734,BOOK XXII.,"“Father, lo, now I will bring thee a shield and two spears and a helmet"
11735,BOOK XXII.,"all of bronze, close fitting on the temples, and when I return I will"
11736,BOOK XXII.,"arm myself, and likewise give arms to the swineherd and to the neatherd"
11737,BOOK XXII.,yonder: for it is better to be clad in full armour.”
11738,BOOK XXII.,
11739,BOOK XXII.,And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Run and bring them
11740,BOOK XXII.,"while I have arrows to defend me, lest they thrust me from the doorway,"
11741,BOOK XXII.,one man against them all.”
11742,BOOK XXII.,
11743,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and Telemachus obeyed his dear father, and went forth to"
11744,BOOK XXII.,"the chamber, where his famous weapons were lying. Thence he took out"
11745,BOOK XXII.,"four shields and eight spears, and four helmets of bronze, with thick"
11746,BOOK XXII.,"plumes of horse hair, and he started to bring them and came quickly to"
11747,BOOK XXII.,"his father. Now he girded the gear of bronze about his own body first,"
11748,BOOK XXII.,"and in like manner the two thralls did on the goodly armour, and stood"
11749,BOOK XXII.,"beside the wise and crafty Odysseus. Now he, so long as he had arrows"
11750,BOOK XXII.,"to defend him, kept aiming and smote the wooers one by one in his"
11751,BOOK XXII.,"house, and they fell thick one upon another. But when the arrows failed"
11752,BOOK XXII.,"the prince in his archery, he leaned his bow against the doorpost of"
11753,BOOK XXII.,"the stablished hall, against the shining faces of the entrance. As for"
11754,BOOK XXII.,him he girt his fourfold shield about his shoulders and bound on his
11755,BOOK XXII.,"mighty head a well wrought helmet, with horse hair crest, and terribly"
11756,BOOK XXII.,the plume waved aloft. And he grasped two mighty spears tipped with
11757,BOOK XXII.,bronze.
11758,BOOK XXII.,
11759,BOOK XXII.,Now there was in the well-builded wall a certain postern raised above
11760,BOOK XXII.,"the floor, and there by the topmost level of the threshold of the"
11761,BOOK XXII.,"stablished hall, was a way into an open passage, closed by well-fitted"
11762,BOOK XXII.,folding doors. So Odysseus bade the goodly swineherd stand near thereto
11763,BOOK XXII.,"and watch the way, for thither there was but one approach. Then Agelaus"
11764,BOOK XXII.,"spake among them, and declared his word to all:"
11765,BOOK XXII.,
11766,BOOK XXII.,"“Friends, will not some man climb up to the postern, and give word to"
11767,BOOK XXII.,"the people, and a cry would be raised straightway; so should this man"
11768,BOOK XXII.,soon have shot his latest bolt?”
11769,BOOK XXII.,
11770,BOOK XXII.,"Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him, saying: “It may in no wise"
11771,BOOK XXII.,"be, prince Agelaus; for the fair gate of the courtyard is terribly"
11772,BOOK XXII.,"nigh, and perilous is the entrance to the passage, and one man, if he"
11773,BOOK XXII.,"were valiant, might keep back a host. But come, let me bring you armour"
11774,BOOK XXII.,"from the inner chamber, that ye may be clad in hauberks, for, methinks,"
11775,BOOK XXII.,within that room and not elsewhere did Odysseus and his renowned son
11776,BOOK XXII.,lay by the arms.”
11777,BOOK XXII.,
11778,BOOK XXII.,"Therewith Melanthius, the goatherd, climbed up by the clerestory of the"
11779,BOOK XXII.,"hall to the inner chambers of Odysseus, whence he took twelve shields"
11780,BOOK XXII.,"and as many spears, and as many helmets of bronze with thick plumes of"
11781,BOOK XXII.,"horse hair, and he came forth and brought them speedily, and gave them"
11782,BOOK XXII.,to the wooers. Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart
11783,BOOK XXII.,"melted within him, when he saw them girding on the armour and"
11784,BOOK XXII.,"brandishing the long spears in their hands, and great, he saw, was the"
11785,BOOK XXII.,adventure. Quickly he spake to Telemachus winged words:
11786,BOOK XXII.,
11787,BOOK XXII.,"“Telemachus, sure I am that one of the women in the halls is stirring"
11788,BOOK XXII.,"up an evil battle against us, or perchance it is Melanthius.”"
11789,BOOK XXII.,
11790,BOOK XXII.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him: “My father, it is I that have erred"
11791,BOOK XXII.,"herein and none other is to blame, for I left the well-fitted door of"
11792,BOOK XXII.,"the chamber open, and there has been one of them but too quick to spy"
11793,BOOK XXII.,"it. Go now, goodly Eumaeus, and close the door of the chamber, and mark"
11794,BOOK XXII.,"if it be indeed one of the women that does this mischief, or"
11795,BOOK XXII.,"Melanthius, son of Dolius, as methinks it is.”"
11796,BOOK XXII.,
11797,BOOK XXII.,"Even so they spake one to the other. And Melanthius, the goatherd, went"
11798,BOOK XXII.,yet again to the chamber to bring the fair armour. But the goodly
11799,BOOK XXII.,"swineherd was ware thereof, and quickly he spake to Odysseus who stood"
11800,BOOK XXII.,nigh him:
11801,BOOK XXII.,
11802,BOOK XXII.,"“Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus, of many devices, lo,"
11803,BOOK XXII.,"there again is that baleful man, whom we ourselves suspect, going to"
11804,BOOK XXII.,"the chamber; do thou tell me truly, shall I slay him if I prove the"
11805,BOOK XXII.,"better man, or bring him hither to thee, that he may pay for the many"
11806,BOOK XXII.,transgressions that he has devised in thy house?”
11807,BOOK XXII.,
11808,BOOK XXII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered saying: “Verily, I and"
11809,BOOK XXII.,"Telemachus will keep the proud wooers within the halls, for all their"
11810,BOOK XXII.,"fury, but do ye twain tie his feet and arms behind his back and cast"
11811,BOOK XXII.,"him into the chamber, and close the doors after you,[39] and make fast"
11812,BOOK XXII.,"to his body a twisted rope, and drag him up the lofty pillar till he be"
11813,BOOK XXII.,"near the roof beams, that he may hang there and live for long, and"
11814,BOOK XXII.,suffer grievous torment.”
11815,BOOK XXII.,
11816,BOOK XXII.,"[39] Or, as Mr. Merry suggests in his note, “tie boards behind him” as"
11817,BOOK XXII.,"a method of torture. He compares Aristoph. Thesm. 931, 940."
11818,BOOK XXII.,
11819,BOOK XXII.,
11820,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and they gave good heed and hearkened. So they went forth"
11821,BOOK XXII.,"to the chamber, but the goatherd who was within knew not of their"
11822,BOOK XXII.,coming. Now he was seeking for the armour in the secret place of the
11823,BOOK XXII.,"chamber, but they twain stood in waiting on either side the doorposts."
11824,BOOK XXII.,"And when Melanthius, the goatherd, was crossing the threshold with a"
11825,BOOK XXII.,"goodly helm in one hand, and in the other a wide shield and an old,"
11826,BOOK XXII.,"stained with rust, the shield of the hero Laertes that he bare when he"
11827,BOOK XXII.,"was young—but at that time it was laid by, and the seams of the straps"
11828,BOOK XXII.,"were loosened,—then the twain rushed on him and caught him, and dragged"
11829,BOOK XXII.,"him in by the hair, and cast him on the floor in sorrowful plight, and"
11830,BOOK XXII.,"bound him hand and foot in a bitter bond, tightly winding each limb"
11831,BOOK XXII.,"behind his back, even as the son of Laertes bade them, the steadfast"
11832,BOOK XXII.,"goodly Odysseus. And they made fast to his body a twisted rope, and"
11833,BOOK XXII.,dragged him up the lofty pillar till he came near the roof beams. Then
11834,BOOK XXII.,"didst thou speak to him and gird at him, swineherd Eumaeus:"
11835,BOOK XXII.,
11836,BOOK XXII.,"“Now in good truth, Melanthius, shalt thou watch all night, lying in a"
11837,BOOK XXII.,"soft bed as beseems thee, nor shall the early-born Dawn escape thy ken,"
11838,BOOK XXII.,"when she comes forth from the streams of Oceanus, on her golden throne,"
11839,BOOK XXII.,in the hour when thou art wont to drive the goats to make a meal for
11840,BOOK XXII.,the wooers in the halls.”
11841,BOOK XXII.,
11842,BOOK XXII.,"So he was left there, stretched tight in the deadly bond. But they"
11843,BOOK XXII.,"twain got into their harness, and closed the shining door, and went to"
11844,BOOK XXII.,"Odysseus, wise and crafty chief. There they stood breathing fury, four"
11845,BOOK XXII.,"men by the threshold, while those others within the halls were many and"
11846,BOOK XXII.,"good warriors. Then Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew nigh them, like"
11847,BOOK XXII.,"Mentor in fashion and in voice, and Odysseus was glad when he saw her"
11848,BOOK XXII.,"and spake, saying:"
11849,BOOK XXII.,
11850,BOOK XXII.,"“Mentor, ward from us hurt, and remember me thy dear companion, that"
11851,BOOK XXII.,"befriended thee often, and thou art of like age with me.”"
11852,BOOK XXII.,
11853,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, deeming the while that it was Athene, summoner of the"
11854,BOOK XXII.,"host. But the wooers on the other side shouted in the halls, and first"
11855,BOOK XXII.,"Agelaus son of Damastor rebuked Athene, saying:"
11856,BOOK XXII.,
11857,BOOK XXII.,"“Mentor, let not the speech of Odysseus beguile thee to fight against"
11858,BOOK XXII.,"the wooers, and to succour him. For methinks that on this wise we shall"
11859,BOOK XXII.,"work our will. When we shall have slain these men, father and son,"
11860,BOOK XXII.,"thereafter shalt thou perish with them, such deeds thou art set on"
11861,BOOK XXII.,"doing in these halls; nay, with thine own head shalt thou pay the"
11862,BOOK XXII.,"price. But when with the sword we shall have overcome your violence, we"
11863,BOOK XXII.,"will mingle all thy possessions, all that thou hast at home or in the"
11864,BOOK XXII.,"field, with the wealth of Odysseus, and we will not suffer thy sons nor"
11865,BOOK XXII.,"thy daughters to dwell in the halls, nor thy good wife to gad about in"
11866,BOOK XXII.,the town of Ithaca.”
11867,BOOK XXII.,
11868,BOOK XXII.,"So spake he, and Athene was mightily angered at heart, and chid"
11869,BOOK XXII.,"Odysseus in wrathful words: “Odysseus, thou hast no more steadfast"
11870,BOOK XXII.,"might nor any prowess, as when for nine whole years continually thou"
11871,BOOK XXII.,"didst battle with the Trojans for high born Helen, of the white arms,"
11872,BOOK XXII.,"and many men thou slewest in terrible warfare, and by thy device the"
11873,BOOK XXII.,"wide-wayed city of Priam was taken. How then, now that thou art come to"
11874,BOOK XXII.,"thy house and thine own possessions, dost thou bewail thee and art of"
11875,BOOK XXII.,"feeble courage to stand before the wooers? Nay, come hither, friend,"
11876,BOOK XXII.,"and stand by me, and I will show thee a thing, that thou mayest know"
11877,BOOK XXII.,"what manner of man is Mentor, son of Alcimus, to repay good deeds in"
11878,BOOK XXII.,the ranks of foemen.”
11879,BOOK XXII.,
11880,BOOK XXII.,"She spake, and gave him not yet clear victory in full, but still for a"
11881,BOOK XXII.,while made trial of the might and prowess of Odysseus and his renowned
11882,BOOK XXII.,"son. As for her she flew up to the roof timber of the murky hall, in"
11883,BOOK XXII.,"such fashion as a swallow flies, and there sat down."
11884,BOOK XXII.,
11885,BOOK XXII.,"Now Agelaus, son of Damastor, urged on the wooers, and likewise"
11886,BOOK XXII.,Eurynomus and Amphimedon and Demoptolemus and Peisandrus son of
11887,BOOK XXII.,"Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these were in valiancy far the best men"
11888,BOOK XXII.,"of the wooers, that still lived and fought for their lives; for the"
11889,BOOK XXII.,rest had fallen already beneath the bow and the thick rain of arrows.
11890,BOOK XXII.,"Then Agelaus spake among them, and made known his word to all:"
11891,BOOK XXII.,
11892,BOOK XXII.,"“Friends, now at last will this man hold his unconquerable hands. Lo,"
11893,BOOK XXII.,"now has Mentor left him and spoken but vain boasts, and these remain"
11894,BOOK XXII.,"alone at the entrance of the doors. Wherefore now, throw not your long"
11895,BOOK XXII.,"spears all together, but come, do ye six cast first, if perchance Zeus"
11896,BOOK XXII.,may grant us to smite Odysseus and win renown. Of the rest will we take
11897,BOOK XXII.,"no heed, so soon as that man shall have fallen.”"
11898,BOOK XXII.,
11899,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake and they all cast their javelins, as he bade them, eagerly;"
11900,BOOK XXII.,"but behold, Athene so wrought that they were all in vain. One man smote"
11901,BOOK XXII.,"the doorpost of the stablished hall, and another the well-fastened"
11902,BOOK XXII.,"door, and the ashen spear of yet another wooer, heavy with bronze,"
11903,BOOK XXII.,stuck fast in the wall. So when they had avoided all the spears of the
11904,BOOK XXII.,"wooers, the steadfast goodly Odysseus began first to speak among them:"
11905,BOOK XXII.,
11906,BOOK XXII.,"“Friends, now my word is that we too cast and hurl into the press of"
11907,BOOK XXII.,"the wooers, that are mad to slay and strip us beyond the measure of"
11908,BOOK XXII.,their former iniquities.”
11909,BOOK XXII.,
11910,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and they all took good aim and threw their sharp spears,"
11911,BOOK XXII.,"and Odysseus smote Demoptolemus, and Telemachus Euryades, and the"
11912,BOOK XXII.,"swineherd slew Elatus, and the neatherd Peisandrus. Thus they all bit"
11913,BOOK XXII.,"the wide floor with their teeth, and the wooers fell back into the"
11914,BOOK XXII.,inmost part of the hall. But the others dashed upon them and drew forth
11915,BOOK XXII.,the shafts from the bodies of the dead.
11916,BOOK XXII.,
11917,BOOK XXII.,"Then once more the wooers threw their sharp spears eagerly; but behold,"
11918,BOOK XXII.,Athene so wrought that many of them were in vain. One man smote the
11919,BOOK XXII.,"door-post of the stablished hall, and another the well-fastened door,"
11920,BOOK XXII.,"and the ashen spear of another wooer, heavy with bronze, struck in the"
11921,BOOK XXII.,"wall. Yet Amphimedon hit Telemachus on the hand by the wrist lightly,"
11922,BOOK XXII.,and the shaft of bronze wounded the surface of the skin. And Ctesippus
11923,BOOK XXII.,"grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus with a long spear high above the shield,"
11924,BOOK XXII.,"and the spear flew over and fell to the ground. Then again Odysseus,"
11925,BOOK XXII.,"the wise and crafty, he and his men cast their swift spears into the"
11926,BOOK XXII.,"press of the wooers, and now once more Odysseus, waster of cities,"
11927,BOOK XXII.,"smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, and the swineherd slew"
11928,BOOK XXII.,"Polybus, and last, the neatherd struck Ctesippus in the breast and"
11929,BOOK XXII.,"boasted over him, saying:"
11930,BOOK XXII.,
11931,BOOK XXII.,"“O son of Polytherses, thou lover of jeering, never give place at all"
11932,BOOK XXII.,"to folly to speak so big, but leave thy case to the gods, since in"
11933,BOOK XXII.,truth they are far mightier than thou. This gift is thy recompense for
11934,BOOK XXII.,"the ox-foot that thou gavest of late to the divine Odysseus, when he"
11935,BOOK XXII.,went begging through the house.”
11936,BOOK XXII.,
11937,BOOK XXII.,So spake the keeper of the shambling kine. Next Odysseus wounded the
11938,BOOK XXII.,"son of Damastor in close fight with his long spear, and Telemachus"
11939,BOOK XXII.,"wounded Leocritus son of Euenor, right in the flank with his lance, and"
11940,BOOK XXII.,"drave the bronze point clean through, that he fell prone and struck the"
11941,BOOK XXII.,ground full with his forehead. Then Athene held up her destroying aegis
11942,BOOK XXII.,"on high from the roof, and their minds were scared, and they fled"
11943,BOOK XXII.,"through the hall, like a drove of kine that the flitting gadfly falls"
11944,BOOK XXII.,"upon and scatters hither and thither in spring time, when the long days"
11945,BOOK XXII.,begin. But the others set on like vultures of crooked claws and curved
11946,BOOK XXII.,"beak, that come forth from the mountains and dash upon smaller birds,"
11947,BOOK XXII.,"and these scour low in the plain, stooping in terror from the clouds,"
11948,BOOK XXII.,"while the vultures pounce on them and slay them, and there is no help"
11949,BOOK XXII.,"nor way of flight, and men are glad at the sport; even so did the"
11950,BOOK XXII.,company of Odysseus set upon the wooers and smite them right and left
11951,BOOK XXII.,through the hall; and there rose a hideous moaning as their heads were
11952,BOOK XXII.,"smitten, and the floor all ran with blood."
11953,BOOK XXII.,
11954,BOOK XXII.,"Now Leiodes took hold of the knees of Odysseus eagerly, and besought"
11955,BOOK XXII.,"him and spake winged words: “I entreat thee by thy knees, Odysseus, and"
11956,BOOK XXII.,"do thou show mercy on me and have pity. For never yet, I say, have I"
11957,BOOK XXII.,"wronged a maiden in thy halls by froward word or deed, nay I bade the"
11958,BOOK XXII.,"other wooers refrain, whoso of them wrought thus. But they hearkened"
11959,BOOK XXII.,not unto me to keep their hands from evil. Wherefore they have met a
11960,BOOK XXII.,"shameful death through their own infatuate deeds. Yet I, the soothsayer"
11961,BOOK XXII.,"among them, that have wrought no evil, shall fall even as they, for no"
11962,BOOK XXII.,grace abides for good deeds done.”
11963,BOOK XXII.,
11964,BOOK XXII.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels looked askance at him, and said: “If"
11965,BOOK XXII.,"indeed thou dost avow thee to be the soothsayer of these men, thou art"
11966,BOOK XXII.,like to have often prayed in the halls that the issue of a glad return
11967,BOOK XXII.,"might be far from me, and that my dear wife should follow thee and bear"
11968,BOOK XXII.,thee children; wherefore thou shalt not escape the bitterness of
11969,BOOK XXII.,death.”
11970,BOOK XXII.,
11971,BOOK XXII.,"Therewith he caught up a sword in his strong hand, that lay where"
11972,BOOK XXII.,"Agelaus had let it fall to the ground when he was slain, and drave it"
11973,BOOK XXII.,"clean through his neck, and as he yet spake his head fell even to the"
11974,BOOK XXII.,dust.
11975,BOOK XXII.,
11976,BOOK XXII.,"But the son of Terpes, the minstrel, still sought how he might shun"
11977,BOOK XXII.,"black fate, Phemius, who sang among the wooers of necessity. He stood"
11978,BOOK XXII.,"with the loud lyre in his hand hard by the postern gate, and his heart"
11979,BOOK XXII.,"was divided within him, whether he should slip forth from the hall and"
11980,BOOK XXII.,sit down by the well-wrought altar of great Zeus of the household
11981,BOOK XXII.,"court, whereon Laertes and Odysseus had burnt many pieces of the thighs"
11982,BOOK XXII.,"of oxen, or should spring forward and beseech Odysseus by his knees."
11983,BOOK XXII.,"And as he thought thereupon this seemed to him the better way, to"
11984,BOOK XXII.,"embrace the knees of Odysseus, son of Laertes. So he laid the hollow"
11985,BOOK XXII.,lyre on the ground between the mixing-bowl and the high seat inlaid
11986,BOOK XXII.,"with silver, and himself sprang forward and seized Odysseus by the"
11987,BOOK XXII.,"knees, and besought him and spake winged words:"
11988,BOOK XXII.,
11989,BOOK XXII.,"“I entreat thee by thy knees, Odysseus, and do thou show mercy on me"
11990,BOOK XXII.,and have pity. It will be a sorrow to thyself in the aftertime if thou
11991,BOOK XXII.,"slayest me who am a minstrel, and sing before gods and men. Yea none"
11992,BOOK XXII.,"has taught me but myself, and the god has put into my heart all manner"
11993,BOOK XXII.,"of lays, and methinks I sing to thee as to a god, wherefore be not"
11994,BOOK XXII.,"eager to cut off my head. And Telemachus will testify of this, thine"
11995,BOOK XXII.,"own dear son, that not by mine own will or desire did I resort to thy"
11996,BOOK XXII.,house to sing to the wooers at their feasts; but being so many and
11997,BOOK XXII.,stronger than I they led me by constraint.”
11998,BOOK XXII.,
11999,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and the mighty prince Telemachus heard him and quickly"
12000,BOOK XXII.,"spake to his father at his side: “Hold thy hand, and wound not this"
12001,BOOK XXII.,"blameless man with the sword; and let us save also the henchman Medon,"
12002,BOOK XXII.,"that ever had charge of me in our house when I was a child, unless"
12003,BOOK XXII.,"perchance Philoetius or the swineherd have already slain him, or he"
12004,BOOK XXII.,hath met thee in thy raging through the house.”
12005,BOOK XXII.,
12006,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him. For he lay crouching"
12007,BOOK XXII.,"beneath a high seat, clad about in the new-flayed hide of an ox and"
12008,BOOK XXII.,"shunned black fate. So he rose up quickly from under the seat, and cast"
12009,BOOK XXII.,"off the ox-hide, and sprang forth and caught Telemachus by the knees,"
12010,BOOK XXII.,and besought him and spake winged words:
12011,BOOK XXII.,
12012,BOOK XXII.,"“Friend, here am I; prithee stay thy hand and speak to thy father, lest"
12013,BOOK XXII.,"he harm me with the sharp sword in the greatness of his strength, out"
12014,BOOK XXII.,"of his anger for the wooers that wasted his possessions in the halls,"
12015,BOOK XXII.,and in their folly held thee in no honour.”
12016,BOOK XXII.,
12017,BOOK XXII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels smiled on him and said: “Take courage,"
12018,BOOK XXII.,"for lo, he has saved thee and delivered thee, that thou mayst know in"
12019,BOOK XXII.,"thy heart, and tell it even to another, how far more excellent are good"
12020,BOOK XXII.,deeds than evil. But go forth from the halls and sit down in the court
12021,BOOK XXII.,"apart from the slaughter, thou and the full-voiced minstrel, till I"
12022,BOOK XXII.,have accomplished all that I must needs do in the house.”
12023,BOOK XXII.,
12024,BOOK XXII.,Therewith the two went forth and gat them from the hall. So they sat
12025,BOOK XXII.,"down by the altar of great Zeus, peering about on every side, still"
12026,BOOK XXII.,"expecting death. And Odysseus peered all through the house, to see if"
12027,BOOK XXII.,any man was yet alive and hiding away to shun black fate. But he found
12028,BOOK XXII.,"all the sort of them fallen in their blood in the dust, like fishes"
12029,BOOK XXII.,that the fishermen have drawn forth in the meshes of the net into a
12030,BOOK XXII.,"hollow of the beach from out the grey sea, and all the fish, sore"
12031,BOOK XXII.,"longing for the salt sea waves, are heaped upon the sand, and the sun"
12032,BOOK XXII.,shines forth and takes their life away; so now the wooers lay heaped
12033,BOOK XXII.,upon each other. Then Odysseus of many counsels spake to Telemachus:
12034,BOOK XXII.,
12035,BOOK XXII.,"“Telemachus, go, call me the nurse Eurycleia, that I may tell her a"
12036,BOOK XXII.,word that is on my mind.”
12037,BOOK XXII.,
12038,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and Telemachus obeyed his dear father, and smote at the"
12039,BOOK XXII.,"door, and spake to the nurse Eurycleia: “Up now, aged wife, that"
12040,BOOK XXII.,"overlookest all the women servants in our halls, come hither, my father"
12041,BOOK XXII.,calls thee and has somewhat to say to thee.”
12042,BOOK XXII.,
12043,BOOK XXII.,"Even so he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she opened the"
12044,BOOK XXII.,"doors of the fair-lying halls, and came forth, and Telemachus led the"
12045,BOOK XXII.,"way before her. So she found Odysseus among the bodies of the dead,"
12046,BOOK XXII.,"stained with blood and soil of battle, like a lion that has eaten of an"
12047,BOOK XXII.,"ox of the homestead and goes on his way, and all his breast and his"
12048,BOOK XXII.,"cheeks on either side are flecked with blood, and he is terrible to"
12049,BOOK XXII.,"behold; even so was Odysseus stained, both hands and feet. Now the"
12050,BOOK XXII.,"nurse, when she saw the bodies of the dead and the great gore of blood,"
12051,BOOK XXII.,"made ready to cry aloud for joy, beholding so great an adventure. But"
12052,BOOK XXII.,"Odysseus checked and held her in her eagerness, and uttering his voice"
12053,BOOK XXII.,spake to her winged words:
12054,BOOK XXII.,
12055,BOOK XXII.,"“Within thine own heart rejoice, old nurse, and be still, and cry not"
12056,BOOK XXII.,aloud; for it is an unholy thing to boast over slain men. Now these
12057,BOOK XXII.,"hath the destiny of the gods overcome, and their own cruel deeds, for"
12058,BOOK XXII.,"they honoured none of earthly men, neither the bad nor yet the good,"
12059,BOOK XXII.,that came among them. Wherefore they have met a shameful death through
12060,BOOK XXII.,"their own infatuate deeds. But come, tell me the tale of the women in"
12061,BOOK XXII.,"my halls, which of them dishonour me, and which be guiltless.”"
12062,BOOK XXII.,
12063,BOOK XXII.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered him: “Yea now, my child, I will"
12064,BOOK XXII.,"tell thee all the truth. Thou hast fifty women-servants in thy halls,"
12065,BOOK XXII.,"that we have taught the ways of housewifery, how to card wool and to"
12066,BOOK XXII.,"bear bondage. Of these twelve in all have gone the way of shame, and"
12067,BOOK XXII.,"honour not me, nor their lady Penelope. And Telemachus hath but newly"
12068,BOOK XXII.,"come to his strength, and his mother suffered him not to take command"
12069,BOOK XXII.,"over the women in this house. But now, let me go aloft to the shining"
12070,BOOK XXII.,"upper chamber, and tell all to thy wife, on whom some god hath sent a"
12071,BOOK XXII.,sleep.”
12072,BOOK XXII.,
12073,BOOK XXII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Wake her not yet,"
12074,BOOK XXII.,"but bid the women come hither, who in time past behaved themselves"
12075,BOOK XXII.,unseemly.”
12076,BOOK XXII.,
12077,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and the old wife passed through the hall, to tell the"
12078,BOOK XXII.,women and to hasten their coming. Then Odysseus called to him
12079,BOOK XXII.,"Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd, and spake to them"
12080,BOOK XXII.,winged words:
12081,BOOK XXII.,
12082,BOOK XXII.,"“Begin ye now to carry out the dead, and bid the women help you, and"
12083,BOOK XXII.,thereafter cleanse the fair high seats and the tables with water and
12084,BOOK XXII.,"porous sponges. And when ye have set all the house in order, lead the"
12085,BOOK XXII.,"maidens without the stablished hall, between the vaulted room and the"
12086,BOOK XXII.,"goodly fence of the court, and there slay them with your long blades,"
12087,BOOK XXII.,till they shall have all given up the ghost and forgotten the love that
12088,BOOK XXII.,"of old they had at the bidding of the wooers, in secret dalliance.”"
12089,BOOK XXII.,
12090,BOOK XXII.,"Even so he spake, and the women came all in a crowd together, making a"
12091,BOOK XXII.,terrible lament and shedding big tears. So first they carried forth the
12092,BOOK XXII.,"bodies of the slain, and set them beneath the gallery of the fenced"
12093,BOOK XXII.,"court, and propped them one on another; and Odysseus himself hasted the"
12094,BOOK XXII.,"women and directed them, and they carried forth the dead perforce."
12095,BOOK XXII.,Thereafter they cleansed the fair high seats and the tables with water
12096,BOOK XXII.,"and porous sponges. And Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the"
12097,BOOK XXII.,"swineherd, scraped with spades the floor of the well-builded house,"
12098,BOOK XXII.,"and, behold, the maidens carried all forth and laid it without the"
12099,BOOK XXII.,doors.
12100,BOOK XXII.,
12101,BOOK XXII.,"Now when they had made an end of setting the hall in order, they led"
12102,BOOK XXII.,"the maidens forth from the stablished hall, and drove them up in a"
12103,BOOK XXII.,narrow space between the vaulted room and the goodly fence of the
12104,BOOK XXII.,"court, whence none might avoid; and wise Telemachus began to speak to"
12105,BOOK XXII.,"his fellows, saying: “God forbid that I should take these women’s lives"
12106,BOOK XXII.,"by a clean death, these that have poured dishonour on my head and on my"
12107,BOOK XXII.,"mother, and have lain with the wooers.”"
12108,BOOK XXII.,
12109,BOOK XXII.,With that word he tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a great
12110,BOOK XXII.,"pillar and flung it round the vaulted room, and fastened it aloft, that"
12111,BOOK XXII.,"none might touch the ground with her feet. And even as when thrushes,"
12112,BOOK XXII.,"long of wing, or doves fall into a net that is set in a thicket, as"
12113,BOOK XXII.,"they seek to their roosting-place, and a loathly bed harbours them,"
12114,BOOK XXII.,"even so the women held their heads all in a row, and about all their"
12115,BOOK XXII.,"necks nooses were cast, that they might die by the most pitiful death."
12116,BOOK XXII.,"And they writhed with their feet for a little space, but for no long"
12117,BOOK XXII.,while.
12118,BOOK XXII.,
12119,BOOK XXII.,"Then they led out Melanthius through the doorway and the court, and cut"
12120,BOOK XXII.,"off his nostrils and his ears with the pitiless sword, and drew forth"
12121,BOOK XXII.,"his vitals for the dogs to devour raw, and cut off his hands and feet"
12122,BOOK XXII.,in their cruel anger.
12123,BOOK XXII.,
12124,BOOK XXII.,"Thereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into the house to"
12125,BOOK XXII.,"Odysseus, and all the adventure was over. So Odysseus called to the"
12126,BOOK XXII.,"good nurse Eurycleia: “Bring sulphur, old nurse, that cleanses all"
12127,BOOK XXII.,"pollution and bring me fire, that I may purify the house with sulphur,"
12128,BOOK XXII.,"and do thou bid Penelope come here with her handmaidens, and tell all"
12129,BOOK XXII.,the women to hasten into the hall.”
12130,BOOK XXII.,
12131,BOOK XXII.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia made answer: “Yea, my child, herein thou"
12132,BOOK XXII.,"hast spoken aright. But go to, let me bring thee a mantle and a doublet"
12133,BOOK XXII.,"for raiment, and stand not thus in the halls with thy broad shoulders"
12134,BOOK XXII.,wrapped in rags; it were blame in thee so to do.”
12135,BOOK XXII.,
12136,BOOK XXII.,And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “First let a fire
12137,BOOK XXII.,now be made me in the hall.”
12138,BOOK XXII.,
12139,BOOK XXII.,"So he spake, and the good nurse Eurycleia was not slow to obey, but"
12140,BOOK XXII.,brought fire and brimstone; and Odysseus thoroughly purged the women’s
12141,BOOK XXII.,chamber and the great hall and the court.
12142,BOOK XXII.,
12143,BOOK XXII.,Then the old wife went through the fair halls of Odysseus to tell the
12144,BOOK XXII.,"women, and to hasten their coming. So they came forth from their"
12145,BOOK XXII.,"chamber with torches in their hands, and fell about Odysseus, and"
12146,BOOK XXII.,embraced him and kissed and clasped his head and shoulders and his
12147,BOOK XXII.,"hands lovingly, and a sweet longing came on him to weep and moan, for"
12148,BOOK XXII.,he remembered them every one.
12149,BOOK XXII.,
12150,BOOK XXII.,
12151,BOOK XXII.,
12152,BOOK XXIII.,BOOK XXIII.
12153,BOOK XXIII.,
12154,BOOK XXIII.,
12155,BOOK XXIII.,"Odysseus maketh himself known to Penelope, tells his adventures"
12156,BOOK XXIII.,"briefly, and in the morning goes to Laertes and makes himself known to"
12157,BOOK XXIII.,him.
12158,BOOK XXIII.,
12159,BOOK XXIII.,
12160,BOOK XXIII.,"Then the ancient woman went up into the upper chamber laughing aloud,"
12161,BOOK XXIII.,"to tell her mistress how her dear lord was within, and her knees moved"
12162,BOOK XXIII.,"fast for joy, and her feet stumbled one over the other; and she stood"
12163,BOOK XXIII.,"above the lady’s head and spake to her, saying:"
12164,BOOK XXIII.,
12165,BOOK XXIII.,"“Awake, Penelope, dear child, that thou mayest see with thine own eyes"
12166,BOOK XXIII.,"that which thou desirest day by day. Odysseus hath come, and hath got"
12167,BOOK XXIII.,"him to his own house, though late hath he come, and hath slain the"
12168,BOOK XXIII.,"proud wooers that troubled his house, and devoured his substance, and"
12169,BOOK XXIII.,oppressed his child.”
12170,BOOK XXIII.,
12171,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, the gods have made thee"
12172,BOOK XXIII.,"distraught, the gods that can make foolish even the wisdom of the wise,"
12173,BOOK XXIII.,and that stablish the simple in understanding. They it is that have
12174,BOOK XXIII.,"marred thy reason, though heretofore thou hadst a prudent heart. Why"
12175,BOOK XXIII.,"dost thou mock me, who have a spirit full of sorrow, to speak these"
12176,BOOK XXIII.,"wild words, and rousest me out of sweet slumber, that had bound me and"
12177,BOOK XXIII.,overshadowed mine eyelids? Never yet have I slept so sound since the
12178,BOOK XXIII.,"day that Odysseus went forth to see that evil Ilios, never to be named."
12179,BOOK XXIII.,"Go to now, get thee down and back to the women’s chamber, for if any"
12180,BOOK XXIII.,"other of the maids of my house had come and brought me such tidings,"
12181,BOOK XXIII.,"and wakened me from sleep, straightway would I have sent her back"
12182,BOOK XXIII.,woefully to return within the women’s chamber; but this time thine old
12183,BOOK XXIII.,age shall stand thee in good stead.”
12184,BOOK XXIII.,
12185,BOOK XXIII.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: “I mock thee not, dear"
12186,BOOK XXIII.,"child, but in very deed Odysseus is here, and hath come home, even as I"
12187,BOOK XXIII.,tell thee. He is that guest on whom all men wrought such dishonour in
12188,BOOK XXIII.,"the halls. But long ago Telemachus was ware of him, that he was within"
12189,BOOK XXIII.,"the house, yet in his prudence he hid the counsels of his father, that"
12190,BOOK XXIII.,he might take vengeance on the violence of the haughty wooers.”
12191,BOOK XXIII.,
12192,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus she spake, and then was Penelope glad, and leaping from her bed"
12193,BOOK XXIII.,"she fell on the old woman’s neck, and let fall the tears from her"
12194,BOOK XXIII.,"eyelids, and uttering her voice spake to her winged words: “Come, dear"
12195,BOOK XXIII.,"nurse, I pray thee, tell me all truly—if indeed he hath come home as"
12196,BOOK XXIII.,"thou sayest—how he hath laid his hands on the shameless wooers, he"
12197,BOOK XXIII.,"being but one man, while they abode ever in their companies within the"
12198,BOOK XXIII.,house.”
12199,BOOK XXIII.,
12200,BOOK XXIII.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: “I saw not, I wist not,"
12201,BOOK XXIII.,only I heard the groaning of men slain. And we in an inmost place of
12202,BOOK XXIII.,"the well-builded chambers sat all amazed, and the close-fitted doors"
12203,BOOK XXIII.,"shut in the room, till thy son called me from the chamber, for his"
12204,BOOK XXIII.,father sent him out to that end. Then I found Odysseus standing among
12205,BOOK XXIII.,"the slain, who around him, stretched on the hard floor, lay one upon"
12206,BOOK XXIII.,"the other; it would have comforted thy heart to see him, all stained"
12207,BOOK XXIII.,like a lion with blood and soil of battle. And now are all the wooers
12208,BOOK XXIII.,"gathered in an heap by the gates of the court, while he is purifying"
12209,BOOK XXIII.,"his fair house with brimstone, and hath kindled a great fire, and hath"
12210,BOOK XXIII.,"sent me forth to call thee. So come with me, that ye may both enter"
12211,BOOK XXIII.,"into your heart’s delight,[40] for ye have suffered much affliction."
12212,BOOK XXIII.,And even now hath this thy long desire been fulfilled; thy lord hath
12213,BOOK XXIII.,"come alive to his own hearth, and hath found both thee and his son in"
12214,BOOK XXIII.,"the halls; and the wooers that wrought him evil he hath slain, every"
12215,BOOK XXIII.,man of them in his house.”
12216,BOOK XXIII.,
12217,BOOK XXIII.,[40] Reading σφῶι . . . . ἀμφοτέρω.
12218,BOOK XXIII.,
12219,BOOK XXIII.,
12220,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, boast not yet over them"
12221,BOOK XXIII.,with laughter. Thou knowest how welcome the sight of him would be in
12222,BOOK XXIII.,"the halls to all, and to me in chief, and to his son that we got"
12223,BOOK XXIII.,"between us. But this is no true tale, as thou declarest it, nay but it"
12224,BOOK XXIII.,"is one of the deathless gods that hath slain the proud wooers, in wrath"
12225,BOOK XXIII.,at their bitter insolence and evil deeds. For they honoured none of
12226,BOOK XXIII.,"earthly men, neither the good nor yet the bad, that came among them."
12227,BOOK XXIII.,Wherefore they have suffered an evil doom through their own infatuate
12228,BOOK XXIII.,"deeds. But Odysseus, far away hath lost his homeward path to the"
12229,BOOK XXIII.,"Achaean land, and himself is lost.”"
12230,BOOK XXIII.,
12231,BOOK XXIII.,"Then the good nurse Eurycleia made answer to her: “My child, what word"
12232,BOOK XXIII.,"hath escaped the door of thy lips, in that thou saidest that thy lord,"
12233,BOOK XXIII.,"who is even now within, and by his own hearthstone, would return no"
12234,BOOK XXIII.,"more? Nay, thy heart is ever hard of belief. Go to now, and I will tell"
12235,BOOK XXIII.,"thee besides a most manifest token, even the scar of the wound that the"
12236,BOOK XXIII.,boar on a time dealt him with his white tusk. This I spied while
12237,BOOK XXIII.,"washing his feet, and fain I would have told it even to thee, but he"
12238,BOOK XXIII.,"laid his hand on my mouth, and in the fulness of his wisdom suffered me"
12239,BOOK XXIII.,not to speak. But come with me and I will stake my life on it; and if I
12240,BOOK XXIII.,"play thee false, do thou slay me by a death most pitiful.”"
12241,BOOK XXIII.,
12242,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wise Penelope made answer to her: “Dear nurse, it is hard for"
12243,BOOK XXIII.,"thee, how wise soever, to observe the purposes of the everlasting gods."
12244,BOOK XXIII.,"None the less let us go to my child, that I may see the wooers dead,"
12245,BOOK XXIII.,and him that slew them.”
12246,BOOK XXIII.,
12247,BOOK XXIII.,"With that word she went down from the upper chamber, and much her heart"
12248,BOOK XXIII.,"debated, whether she should stand apart, and question her dear lord or"
12249,BOOK XXIII.,"draw nigh, and clasp and kiss his head and hands. But when she had come"
12250,BOOK XXIII.,"within and had crossed the threshold of stone, she sat down over"
12251,BOOK XXIII.,"against Odysseus, in the light of the fire, by the further wall. Now he"
12252,BOOK XXIII.,"was sitting by the tall pillar, looking down and waiting to know if"
12253,BOOK XXIII.,"perchance his noble wife would speak to him, when her eyes beheld him."
12254,BOOK XXIII.,"But she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul, and now"
12255,BOOK XXIII.,"she would look upon him steadfastly with her eyes, and now again she"
12256,BOOK XXIII.,"knew him not, for that he was clad in vile raiment. And Telemachus"
12257,BOOK XXIII.,"rebuked her, and spake and hailed her:"
12258,BOOK XXIII.,
12259,BOOK XXIII.,"“Mother mine, ill mother, of an ungentle heart, why turnest thou thus"
12260,BOOK XXIII.,"away from my father, and dost not sit by him and question him and ask"
12261,BOOK XXIII.,him all? No other woman in the world would harden her heart to stand
12262,BOOK XXIII.,"thus aloof from her lord, who after much travail and sore had come to"
12263,BOOK XXIII.,her in the twentieth year to his own country. But thy heart is ever
12264,BOOK XXIII.,harder than stone.”
12265,BOOK XXIII.,
12266,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wise Penelope answered him, saying: “Child, my mind is amazed"
12267,BOOK XXIII.,"within me, and I have no strength to speak, nor to ask him aught, nay"
12268,BOOK XXIII.,"nor to look on him face to face. But if in truth this be Odysseus, and"
12269,BOOK XXIII.,"he hath indeed come home, verily we shall be ware of each other the"
12270,BOOK XXIII.,"more surely, for we have tokens that we twain know, even we, secret"
12271,BOOK XXIII.,from all others.”
12272,BOOK XXIII.,
12273,BOOK XXIII.,"So she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus smiled, and quickly he"
12274,BOOK XXIII.,"spake to Telemachus winged words: “Telemachus, leave now thy mother to"
12275,BOOK XXIII.,make trial of me within the chambers; so shall she soon come to a
12276,BOOK XXIII.,"better knowledge than heretofore. But now I go filthy, and am clad in"
12277,BOOK XXIII.,"vile raiment, wherefore she has me in dishonour, and as yet will not"
12278,BOOK XXIII.,allow that I am he. Let us then advise us how all may be for the very
12279,BOOK XXIII.,"best. For whoso has slain but one man in a land, even that one leaves"
12280,BOOK XXIII.,"not many behind him to take up the feud for him, turns outlaw and"
12281,BOOK XXIII.,leaves his kindred and his own country; but we have slain the very stay
12282,BOOK XXIII.,"of the city, the men who were far the best of all the noble youths in"
12283,BOOK XXIII.,Ithaca. So this I bid thee consider.”
12284,BOOK XXIII.,
12285,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Father, see thou to this,"
12286,BOOK XXIII.,"for they say that thy counsel is far the best among men, nor might any"
12287,BOOK XXIII.,other of mortal men contend with thee. But right eagerly will we go
12288,BOOK XXIII.,"with thee now, and I think we shall not lack prowess, so far as might"
12289,BOOK XXIII.,is ours.”
12290,BOOK XXIII.,
12291,BOOK XXIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Yea now, I will"
12292,BOOK XXIII.,"tell on what wise methinks it is best. First, go ye to the bath and"
12293,BOOK XXIII.,"array you in your doublets, and bid the maidens in the chambers to take"
12294,BOOK XXIII.,"to them their garments. Then let the divine minstrel, with his loud"
12295,BOOK XXIII.,"lyre in hand, lead off for us the measure of the mirthful dance. So"
12296,BOOK XXIII.,"shall any man that hears the sound from without, whether a wayfarer or"
12297,BOOK XXIII.,"one of those that dwell around, say that it is a wedding feast. And"
12298,BOOK XXIII.,thus the slaughter of the wooers shall not be noised abroad through the
12299,BOOK XXIII.,town before we go forth to our well-wooded farm-land. Thereafter shall
12300,BOOK XXIII.,we consider what gainful counsel the Olympian may vouchsafe us.”
12301,BOOK XXIII.,
12302,BOOK XXIII.,"So he spake, and they gave good ear and hearkened to him. So first they"
12303,BOOK XXIII.,"went to the bath, and arrayed them in doublets, and the women were"
12304,BOOK XXIII.,"apparelled, and the divine minstrel took the hollow harp, and aroused"
12305,BOOK XXIII.,in them the desire of sweet song and of the happy dance. Then the great
12306,BOOK XXIII.,hall rang round them with the sound of the feet of dancing men and of
12307,BOOK XXIII.,fair-girdled women. And whoso heard it from without would say:
12308,BOOK XXIII.,
12309,BOOK XXIII.,“Surely some one has wedded the queen of many wooers. Hard of heart was
12310,BOOK XXIII.,"she, nor had she courage to keep the great house of her wedded lord"
12311,BOOK XXIII.,continually till his coming.”
12312,BOOK XXIII.,
12313,BOOK XXIII.,"Even so men spake, and knew not how these things were ordained."
12314,BOOK XXIII.,"Meanwhile, the house-dame Eurynome had bathed the great-hearted"
12315,BOOK XXIII.,"Odysseus within his house, and anointed him with olive-oil, and cast"
12316,BOOK XXIII.,about him a goodly mantle and a doublet. Moreover Athene shed great
12317,BOOK XXIII.,"beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to"
12318,BOOK XXIII.,"behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the"
12319,BOOK XXIII.,hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon
12320,BOOK XXIII.,"silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of"
12321,BOOK XXIII.,"craft, and full of grace is his handiwork, even so did Athene shed"
12322,BOOK XXIII.,"grace about his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in"
12323,BOOK XXIII.,"form like to the immortals. Then he sat down again on the high seat,"
12324,BOOK XXIII.,"whence he had arisen, over against his wife, and spake to her, saying:"
12325,BOOK XXIII.,
12326,BOOK XXIII.,"“Strange lady, surely to thee above all womankind the Olympians have"
12327,BOOK XXIII.,given a heart that cannot be softened. No other woman in the world
12328,BOOK XXIII.,"would harden her heart to stand thus aloof from her husband, who after"
12329,BOOK XXIII.,"much travail and sore had come to her, in the twentieth year, to his"
12330,BOOK XXIII.,"own country. Nay come, nurse, strew a bed for me to lie all alone, for"
12331,BOOK XXIII.,assuredly her spirit within her is as iron.”
12332,BOOK XXIII.,
12333,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wise Penelope answered him again: “Strange man, I have no proud"
12334,BOOK XXIII.,"thoughts nor do I think scorn of thee, nor am I too greatly astonied,"
12335,BOOK XXIII.,"but I know right well what manner of man thou wert, when thou wentest"
12336,BOOK XXIII.,"forth out of Ithaca, on the long-oared galley. But come, Eurycleia,"
12337,BOOK XXIII.,spread for him the good bedstead outside the stablished bridal chamber
12338,BOOK XXIII.,that he built himself. Thither bring ye forth the good bedstead and
12339,BOOK XXIII.,"cast bedding thereon, even fleeces and rugs and shining blankets.”"
12340,BOOK XXIII.,
12341,BOOK XXIII.,"So she spake and made trial of her lord, but Odysseus in sore"
12342,BOOK XXIII.,"displeasure spake to his true wife, saying: “Verily a bitter word is"
12343,BOOK XXIII.,"this, lady, that thou hast spoken. Who has set my bed otherwhere? Hard"
12344,BOOK XXIII.,"it would be for one, how skilled so ever, unless a god were to come"
12345,BOOK XXIII.,"that might easily set it in another place, if so he would. But of men"
12346,BOOK XXIII.,"there is none living, howsoever strong in his youth, that could lightly"
12347,BOOK XXIII.,"upheave it, for a great token is wrought in the fashioning of the bed,"
12348,BOOK XXIII.,and it was I that made it and none other. There was growing a bush of
12349,BOOK XXIII.,"olive, long of leaf, and most goodly of growth, within the inner court,"
12350,BOOK XXIII.,and the stem as large as a pillar. Round about this I built the
12351,BOOK XXIII.,"chamber, till I had finished it, with stones close set, and I roofed it"
12352,BOOK XXIII.,over well and added thereto compacted doors fitting well. Next I
12353,BOOK XXIII.,"sheared off all the light wood of the long-leaved olive, and"
12354,BOOK XXIII.,"rough-hewed the trunk upwards from the root, and smoothed it around"
12355,BOOK XXIII.,"with the adze, well and skilfully, and made straight the line thereto"
12356,BOOK XXIII.,"and so fashioned it into the bedpost, and I bored it all with the"
12357,BOOK XXIII.,"auger. Beginning from this bedpost, I wrought at the bedstead till I"
12358,BOOK XXIII.,"had finished it, and made it fair with inlaid work of gold and of"
12359,BOOK XXIII.,silver and of ivory. Then I made fast therein a bright purple band of
12360,BOOK XXIII.,"oxhide. Even so I declare to thee this token, and I know not, lady, if"
12361,BOOK XXIII.,"the bedstead be yet fast in his place, or if some man has cut away the"
12362,BOOK XXIII.,"stem of the olive tree, and set the bedstead otherwhere.”"
12363,BOOK XXIII.,
12364,BOOK XXIII.,"So he spake, and at once her knees were loosened, and her heart melted"
12365,BOOK XXIII.,"within her, as she knew the sure tokens that Odysseus showed her. Then"
12366,BOOK XXIII.,"she fell a weeping, and ran straight toward him and cast her hands"
12367,BOOK XXIII.,"about his neck, and kissed his head and spake, saying:"
12368,BOOK XXIII.,
12369,BOOK XXIII.,"“Be not angry with me, Odysseus, for thou wert ever at other times the"
12370,BOOK XXIII.,"wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us sorrow, the gods who"
12371,BOOK XXIII.,"begrudged us that we should abide together and have joy of our youth,"
12372,BOOK XXIII.,and come to the threshold of old age. So now be not wroth with me
12373,BOOK XXIII.,"hereat nor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw thee,"
12374,BOOK XXIII.,I did not welcome thee straightway. For always my heart within my
12375,BOOK XXIII.,"breast shuddered, for fear lest some man should come and deceive me"
12376,BOOK XXIII.,"with his words, for many they be that devise gainful schemes and evil."
12377,BOOK XXIII.,"Nay even Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain with a"
12378,BOOK XXIII.,"stranger, and taken him for a lover, had she known that the warlike"
12379,BOOK XXIII.,sons of the Achaeans would bring her home again to her own dear
12380,BOOK XXIII.,"country. Howsoever, it was the god that set her upon this shameful"
12381,BOOK XXIII.,"deed; nor ever, ere that, did she lay up in her heart the thought of"
12382,BOOK XXIII.,"this folly, a bitter folly, whence on us too first came sorrow. But now"
12383,BOOK XXIII.,"that thou hast told all the sure tokens of our bed, which never was"
12384,BOOK XXIII.,"seen by mortal man, save by thee and me and one maiden only, the"
12385,BOOK XXIII.,"daughter of Actor, that my father gave me ere yet I had come hither,"
12386,BOOK XXIII.,"she who kept the doors of our strong bridal chamber, even now dost thou"
12387,BOOK XXIII.,"bend my soul, all ungentle as it is.”"
12388,BOOK XXIII.,
12389,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus she spake, and in his heart she stirred yet a greater longing to"
12390,BOOK XXIII.,"lament, and he wept as he embraced his beloved wife and true. And even"
12391,BOOK XXIII.,"as when the sight of land is welcome to swimmers, whose well-wrought"
12392,BOOK XXIII.,"ship Poseidon hath smitten on the deep, all driven with the wind and"
12393,BOOK XXIII.,"swelling waves, and but a remnant hath escaped the grey sea-water and"
12394,BOOK XXIII.,"swum to the shore, and their bodies are all crusted with the brine, and"
12395,BOOK XXIII.,gladly have they set foot on land and escaped an evil end; so welcome
12396,BOOK XXIII.,"to her was the sight of her lord, and her white arms she would never"
12397,BOOK XXIII.,quite let go from his neck. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have
12398,BOOK XXIII.,"risen upon their weeping, but the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had other"
12399,BOOK XXIII.,"thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West, and on the other"
12400,BOOK XXIII.,"side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by the stream Oceanus, and"
12401,BOOK XXIII.,suffered her not to harness the swift-footed steeds that bear light to
12402,BOOK XXIII.,"men, Lampus and Phaethon, the steeds ever young, that bring the"
12403,BOOK XXIII.,morning.
12404,BOOK XXIII.,
12405,BOOK XXIII.,"Then at the last, Odysseus of many counsels spake to his wife, saying:"
12406,BOOK XXIII.,"“Lady, we have not yet come to the issue of all our labours; but still"
12407,BOOK XXIII.,"there will be toil unmeasured, long and difficult, that I must needs"
12408,BOOK XXIII.,"bring to a full end. Even so the spirit of Teiresias foretold to me, on"
12409,BOOK XXIII.,"that day when I went down into the house of Hades, to inquire after a"
12410,BOOK XXIII.,"returning for myself and my company. Wherefore come, lady, let us to"
12411,BOOK XXIII.,"bed, that forthwith we may take our joy of rest beneath the spell of"
12412,BOOK XXIII.,sweet sleep.”
12413,BOOK XXIII.,
12414,BOOK XXIII.,Then wise Penelope answered him: “Thy bed verily shall be ready
12415,BOOK XXIII.,"whensoever thy soul desires it, forasmuch as the gods have indeed"
12416,BOOK XXIII.,caused thee to come back to thy stablished home and thine own country.
12417,BOOK XXIII.,"But now that thou hast noted it and the god has put it into thy heart,"
12418,BOOK XXIII.,"come, tell me of this ordeal, for methinks the day will come when I"
12419,BOOK XXIII.,"must learn it, and timely knowledge is no hurt.”"
12420,BOOK XXIII.,
12421,BOOK XXIII.,"And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Ah, why now art"
12422,BOOK XXIII.,thou so instant with me to declare it? Yet I will tell thee all and
12423,BOOK XXIII.,"hide nought. Howbeit thy heart shall have no joy of it, as even I"
12424,BOOK XXIII.,myself have no pleasure therein. For Teiresias bade me fare to many
12425,BOOK XXIII.,"cities of men, carrying a shapen oar in my hands, till I should come to"
12426,BOOK XXIII.,"such men as know not the sea, neither eat meat savoured with salt, nor"
12427,BOOK XXIII.,"have they knowledge of ships of purple cheek nor of shapen oars, which"
12428,BOOK XXIII.,"serve for wings to ships. And he told me this with manifest token,"
12429,BOOK XXIII.,which I will not hide from thee. In the day when another wayfarer
12430,BOOK XXIII.,"should meet me and say that I had a winnowing fan on my stout shoulder,"
12431,BOOK XXIII.,"even then he bade me make fast my shapen oar in the earth, and do"
12432,BOOK XXIII.,"goodly sacrifice to the lord Poseidon, even with a ram and a bull and a"
12433,BOOK XXIII.,"boar, the mate of swine, and depart for home, and offer holy hecatombs"
12434,BOOK XXIII.,"to the deathless gods, that keep the wide heaven, to each in order due."
12435,BOOK XXIII.,"And from the sea shall mine own death come, the gentlest death that may"
12436,BOOK XXIII.,"be, which shall end me, foredone, with smooth old age, and the folk"
12437,BOOK XXIII.,"shall dwell happily around. All this, he said, was to be fulfilled.”"
12438,BOOK XXIII.,
12439,BOOK XXIII.,Then wise Penelope answered him saying: “If indeed the gods will bring
12440,BOOK XXIII.,"about for thee a happier old age at the last, then is there hope that"
12441,BOOK XXIII.,thou mayest yet have an escape from evil.”
12442,BOOK XXIII.,
12443,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus they spake one to the other. Meanwhile, Eurynome and the nurse"
12444,BOOK XXIII.,"spread the bed with soft coverlets, by the light of the torches"
12445,BOOK XXIII.,"burning. But when they had busied them and spread the good bed, the"
12446,BOOK XXIII.,"ancient nurse went back to her chamber to lie down, and Eurynome, the"
12447,BOOK XXIII.,"bower-maiden, guided them on their way to the couch, with torches in"
12448,BOOK XXIII.,"her hands, and when she had led them to the bridal-chamber she"
12449,BOOK XXIII.,"departed. And so they came gladly to the rites of their bed, as of old."
12450,BOOK XXIII.,"But Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd stayed their feet"
12451,BOOK XXIII.,"from dancing, and made the women to cease, and themselves gat them to"
12452,BOOK XXIII.,rest through the shadowy halls.
12453,BOOK XXIII.,
12454,BOOK XXIII.,"Now when the twain had taken their fill of sweet love, they had delight"
12455,BOOK XXIII.,"in the tales, which they told one to the other. The fair lady spoke of"
12456,BOOK XXIII.,all that she had endured in the halls at the sight of the ruinous
12457,BOOK XXIII.,"throng of wooers, who for her sake slew many cattle, kine and goodly"
12458,BOOK XXIII.,"sheep; and many a cask of wine was broached. And in turn, Odysseus, of"
12459,BOOK XXIII.,"the seed of Zeus, recounted all the griefs he had wrought on men, and"
12460,BOOK XXIII.,"all his own travail and sorrow, and she was delighted with the story,"
12461,BOOK XXIII.,and sweet sleep fell not upon her eyelids till the tale was ended.
12462,BOOK XXIII.,
12463,BOOK XXIII.,"He began by setting forth how he overcame the Cicones, and next arrived"
12464,BOOK XXIII.,"at the rich land of the Lotus-eaters, and all that the Cyclops wrought,"
12465,BOOK XXIII.,and what a price he got from him for the good companions that he
12466,BOOK XXIII.,"devoured, and showed no pity. Then how he came to Aeolus, who received"
12467,BOOK XXIII.,him gladly and sent him on his way; but it was not yet ordained that he
12468,BOOK XXIII.,"should reach his own country, for the storm-wind seized him again, and"
12469,BOOK XXIII.,"bare him over the teeming seas, making grievous moan. Next how he came"
12470,BOOK XXIII.,"to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians, who brake his ships and slew all"
12471,BOOK XXIII.,"his goodly-greaved companions, and Odysseus only escaped with his black"
12472,BOOK XXIII.,"ship. Then he told all the wiles and many contrivances of Circe, and"
12473,BOOK XXIII.,"how in a benched ship he fared to the dank house of Hades, to seek to"
12474,BOOK XXIII.,the soul of Theban Teiresias. There he beheld all those that had been
12475,BOOK XXIII.,"his companions, and his mother who bore him and nurtured him, while yet"
12476,BOOK XXIII.,he was a little one. Then how he heard the song of the full-voiced
12477,BOOK XXIII.,"Sirens, and came to the Rocks Wandering, and to terrible Charybdis, and"
12478,BOOK XXIII.,"to Scylla, that never yet have men avoided scatheless. Next he told how"
12479,BOOK XXIII.,"his company slew the kine of Helios, and how Zeus, that thunders on"
12480,BOOK XXIII.,"high, smote the swift ship with the flaming bolt, and the good crew"
12481,BOOK XXIII.,"perished all together, and he alone escaped from evil fates. And how he"
12482,BOOK XXIII.,"came to the isle Ogygia, and to the nymph Calypso, who kept him there"
12483,BOOK XXIII.,"in her hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord, and nurtured him"
12484,BOOK XXIII.,and said that she would make him never to know death or age all his
12485,BOOK XXIII.,days: yet she never won his heart within his breast. Next how with
12486,BOOK XXIII.,"great toil he came to the Phaeacians, who gave him all worship"
12487,BOOK XXIII.,"heartily, as to a god, and sent him with a ship to his own dear"
12488,BOOK XXIII.,"country, with gifts of bronze, and of gold, and raiment in plenty. This"
12489,BOOK XXIII.,"was the last word of the tale, when sweet sleep came speedily upon him,"
12490,BOOK XXIII.,"sleep that loosens the limbs of men, unknitting the cares of his soul."
12491,BOOK XXIII.,
12492,BOOK XXIII.,"Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to new thoughts. When she"
12493,BOOK XXIII.,"deemed that Odysseus had taken his fill of love and sleep, straightway"
12494,BOOK XXIII.,"she aroused from out Oceanus the golden-throned Dawn, to bear light to"
12495,BOOK XXIII.,"men. Then Odysseus gat him from his soft bed, and laid this charge on"
12496,BOOK XXIII.,"his wife, saying:"
12497,BOOK XXIII.,
12498,BOOK XXIII.,"“Lady, already have we had enough of labours, thou and I; thou, in"
12499,BOOK XXIII.,"weeping here, and longing for my troublous return, I, while Zeus and"
12500,BOOK XXIII.,"the other gods bound me fast in pain, despite my yearning after home,"
12501,BOOK XXIII.,away from mine own country. But now that we both have come to the bed
12502,BOOK XXIII.,"of our desire, take thou thought for the care of my wealth within the"
12503,BOOK XXIII.,"halls. But as for the sheep that the proud wooers have slain, I myself"
12504,BOOK XXIII.,"will lift many more as spoil, and others the Achaeans will give, till"
12505,BOOK XXIII.,"they fill all my folds. But now, behold, I go to the well-wooded"
12506,BOOK XXIII.,"farm-land, to see my good father, who for love of me has been in sorrow"
12507,BOOK XXIII.,"continually. And this charge I lay on thee, lady, too wise though thou"
12508,BOOK XXIII.,"art to need it. Quickly will the bruit go forth with the rising sun,"
12509,BOOK XXIII.,"the bruit concerning the wooers, whom I slew in the halls. Wherefore"
12510,BOOK XXIII.,"ascend with the women thy handmaids into the upper chamber, and sit"
12511,BOOK XXIII.,"there and look on no man, nor ask any question.”"
12512,BOOK XXIII.,
12513,BOOK XXIII.,"Therewith he girded on his shoulder his goodly armour, and roused"
12514,BOOK XXIII.,"Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, and bade them all take"
12515,BOOK XXIII.,weapons of war in their hands. So they were not disobedient to his
12516,BOOK XXIII.,"word, but clad themselves in mail, and opened the doors and went forth,"
12517,BOOK XXIII.,and Odysseus led the way. And now there was light over all the earth;
12518,BOOK XXIII.,"but them Athene hid in night, and quickly conducted out of the town."
12519,BOOK XXIII.,
12520,BOOK XXIII.,
12521,BOOK XXIII.,
12522,BOOK XXIV.,BOOK XXIV.
12523,BOOK XXIV.,
12524,BOOK XXIV.,
12525,BOOK XXIV.,"The Ithacans bury the wooers, and sitting in council resolve on"
12526,BOOK XXIV.,"revenge. And coming near the house of Laertes, are met by Odysseus, and"
12527,BOOK XXIV.,"Laertes with Telemachus and servants, the whole number twelve, and are"
12528,BOOK XXIV.,"overcome, and submit."
12529,BOOK XXIV.,
12530,BOOK XXIV.,
12531,BOOK XXIV.,Now Cyllenian Hermes called forth from the halls the souls of the
12532,BOOK XXIV.,"wooers, and he held in his hand his wand that is fair and golden,"
12533,BOOK XXIV.,"wherewith he lulls the eyes of men, of whomso he will, while others"
12534,BOOK XXIV.,again he even wakens out of sleep. Herewith he roused and led the souls
12535,BOOK XXIV.,who followed gibbering. And even as bats flit gibbering in the secret
12536,BOOK XXIV.,"place of a wondrous cave, when one has fallen down from the cluster on"
12537,BOOK XXIV.,"the rock, where they cling each to each up aloft, even so the souls"
12538,BOOK XXIV.,"gibbered as they fared together, and Hermes, the helper, led them down"
12539,BOOK XXIV.,"the dank ways. Past the streams of Oceanus and the White Rock, past the"
12540,BOOK XXIV.,"gates of the Sun they sped and the land of dreams, and soon they came"
12541,BOOK XXIV.,"to the mead of asphodel, where dwell the souls, the phantoms of men"
12542,BOOK XXIV.,"outworn. There they found the soul of Achilles son of Peleus, and the"
12543,BOOK XXIV.,"souls of Patroclus, and of noble Antilochus, and of Aias, who in face"
12544,BOOK XXIV.,and form was goodliest of all the Danaans after the noble son of
12545,BOOK XXIV.,Peleus.
12546,BOOK XXIV.,
12547,BOOK XXIV.,"So these were flocking round Achilles, and the spirit of Agamemnon, son"
12548,BOOK XXIV.,"of Atreus, drew nigh sorrowful; and about him were gathered all the"
12549,BOOK XXIV.,"other shades, as many as perished with him in the house of Aegisthus,"
12550,BOOK XXIV.,and met their doom. Now the soul of the son of Peleus spake to him
12551,BOOK XXIV.,"first, saying:"
12552,BOOK XXIV.,
12553,BOOK XXIV.,"“Son of Atreus, verily we deemed that thou above all other heroes wast"
12554,BOOK XXIV.,"evermore dear to Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, seeing that thou"
12555,BOOK XXIV.,"wast lord over warriors, many and mighty men, in the land of the"
12556,BOOK XXIV.,"Trojans where we Achaeans suffered affliction. But lo, thee too was"
12557,BOOK XXIV.,"deadly doom to visit early,[41] the doom that none avoids of all men"
12558,BOOK XXIV.,"born. Ah, would that in the fulness of thy princely honour, thou hadst"
12559,BOOK XXIV.,met death and fate in the land of the Trojans! So would all the Achaean
12560,BOOK XXIV.,"host have builded thee a barrow, yea and for thy son thou wouldst have"
12561,BOOK XXIV.,won great glory in the aftertime. But now it has been decreed for thee
12562,BOOK XXIV.,to perish by a most pitiful death.”
12563,BOOK XXIV.,
12564,BOOK XXIV.,[41] Reading πρῶι.
12565,BOOK XXIV.,
12566,BOOK XXIV.,
12567,BOOK XXIV.,"Then the soul of the son of Atreus answered, and spake: “Happy art thou"
12568,BOOK XXIV.,"son of Peleus, godlike Achilles, that didst die in Troy-land far from"
12569,BOOK XXIV.,"Argos, and about thee fell others, the best of the sons of Trojans and"
12570,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaeans, fighting for thy body; but thou in the whirl of dust layest"
12571,BOOK XXIV.,"mighty and mightily fallen, forgetful of thy chivalry. And we strove"
12572,BOOK XXIV.,"the livelong day, nor would we ever have ceased from the fight, if Zeus"
12573,BOOK XXIV.,had not stayed us with a tempest. Anon when we had borne thee to the
12574,BOOK XXIV.,"ships from out of the battle, we laid thee on a bier and washed thy"
12575,BOOK XXIV.,"fair flesh clean with warm water and unguents, and around thee the"
12576,BOOK XXIV.,Danaans shed many a hot tear and shore their hair. And forth from the
12577,BOOK XXIV.,"sea came thy mother with the deathless maidens of the waters, when they"
12578,BOOK XXIV.,"heard the tidings; and a wonderful wailing rose over the deep, and"
12579,BOOK XXIV.,"trembling fell on the limbs of all the Achaeans. Yea, and they would"
12580,BOOK XXIV.,"have sprung up and departed to the hollow ships, had not one held them"
12581,BOOK XXIV.,"back that knew much lore from of old, Nestor, whose counsel proved"
12582,BOOK XXIV.,"heretofore the best. Out of his good will he made harangue, and spake"
12583,BOOK XXIV.,among them:
12584,BOOK XXIV.,
12585,BOOK XXIV.,"“‘Hold, ye Argives, flee not, young lords of the Achaeans. Lo, his"
12586,BOOK XXIV.,"mother from the sea is she that comes, with the deathless maidens of"
12587,BOOK XXIV.,"the waters, to behold the face of her dead son.’"
12588,BOOK XXIV.,
12589,BOOK XXIV.,"“So he spake, and the high-hearted Achaeans ceased from their flight."
12590,BOOK XXIV.,"Then round thee stood the daughters of the ancient one of the sea,"
12591,BOOK XXIV.,"holding a pitiful lament, and they clad thee about in raiment"
12592,BOOK XXIV.,incorruptible. And all the nine Muses one to the other replying with
12593,BOOK XXIV.,sweet voices began the dirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an
12594,BOOK XXIV.,"Argive but wept, so mightily rose up the clear chant. Thus for"
12595,BOOK XXIV.,"seventeen days and nights continually did we all bewail thee, immortal"
12596,BOOK XXIV.,gods and mortal men. On the eighteenth day we gave thy body to the
12597,BOOK XXIV.,"flames, and many well-fatted sheep we slew around thee, and kine of"
12598,BOOK XXIV.,"shambling gait. So thou wert burned in the garments of the gods, and in"
12599,BOOK XXIV.,"much unguents and in sweet honey, and many heroes of the Achaeans moved"
12600,BOOK XXIV.,"mail-clad around the pyre when thou wast burning, both footmen and"
12601,BOOK XXIV.,"horse, and great was the noise that arose. But when the flame of"
12602,BOOK XXIV.,"Hephaestus had utterly abolished thee, lo, in the morning we gathered"
12603,BOOK XXIV.,"together thy white bones, Achilles, and bestowed them in unmixed wine"
12604,BOOK XXIV.,"and in unguents. Thy mother gave a twy-handled golden urn, and said"
12605,BOOK XXIV.,"that it was the gift of Dionysus, and the workmanship of renowned"
12606,BOOK XXIV.,"Hephaestus. Therein lie thy white bones, great Achilles, and mingled"
12607,BOOK XXIV.,"therewith the bones of Patroclus son of Menoetias, that is dead, but"
12608,BOOK XXIV.,"apart is the dust of Antilochus, whom thou didst honour above all thy"
12609,BOOK XXIV.,"other companions, after Patroclus that was dead. Then over them did we"
12610,BOOK XXIV.,"pile a great and goodly tomb, we the holy host of Argive warriors, high"
12611,BOOK XXIV.,"on a jutting headland over wide Hellespont, that it might be far seen"
12612,BOOK XXIV.,"from off the sea by men that now are, and by those that shall be"
12613,BOOK XXIV.,hereafter. Then thy mother asked the gods for glorious prizes in the
12614,BOOK XXIV.,"games, and set them in the midst of the lists for the champions of the"
12615,BOOK XXIV.,Achaeans. In days past thou hast been at the funeral games of many a
12616,BOOK XXIV.,"hero, whenso, after some king’s death, the young men gird themselves"
12617,BOOK XXIV.,and make them ready for the meed of victory; but couldst thou have seen
12618,BOOK XXIV.,"these gifts thou wouldst most have marvelled in spirit, such glorious"
12619,BOOK XXIV.,"prizes did the goddess set there to honour thee, even Thetis, the"
12620,BOOK XXIV.,silver-footed; for very dear wert thou to the gods. Thus not even in
12621,BOOK XXIV.,"death hast thou lost thy name, but to thee shall be a fair renown for"
12622,BOOK XXIV.,"ever among all men, Achilles. But what joy have I now herein, that I"
12623,BOOK XXIV.,"have wound up the clew of war, for on my return Zeus devised for me an"
12624,BOOK XXIV.,evil end at the hands of Aegisthus and my wife accursed?”
12625,BOOK XXIV.,
12626,BOOK XXIV.,"So they spake one to the other. And nigh them came the Messenger, the"
12627,BOOK XXIV.,"slayer of Argos, leading down the ghosts of the wooers by Odysseus"
12628,BOOK XXIV.,"slain, and the two heroes were amazed at the sight and went straight"
12629,BOOK XXIV.,"toward them. And the soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, knew the dear"
12630,BOOK XXIV.,"son of Melaneus, renowned Amphimedon, who had been his host, having his"
12631,BOOK XXIV.,"dwelling in Ithaca. The soul of the son of Atreus spake to him first,"
12632,BOOK XXIV.,saying:
12633,BOOK XXIV.,
12634,BOOK XXIV.,"“Amphimedon, what hath befallen you, that ye have come beneath the"
12635,BOOK XXIV.,"darkness of earth, all of you picked men and of like age? it is even as"
12636,BOOK XXIV.,though one should choose out and gather together the best warriors in a
12637,BOOK XXIV.,city. Did Poseidon smite you in your ships and rouse up contrary winds
12638,BOOK XXIV.,"and the long waves? Or did unfriendly men, perchance, do you hurt upon"
12639,BOOK XXIV.,"the land as ye were cutting off their oxen and fair flocks of sheep, or"
12640,BOOK XXIV.,while they fought to defend their city and the women thereof? Answer
12641,BOOK XXIV.,"and tell me, for I avow me a friend of thy house. Rememberest thou not"
12642,BOOK XXIV.,"the day when I came to your house in Ithaca with godlike Menelaus, to"
12643,BOOK XXIV.,urge Odysseus to follow with me to Ilios on the decked ships? And it
12644,BOOK XXIV.,"was a full month ere we had sailed all across the wide sea, for scarce"
12645,BOOK XXIV.,"could we win to our cause Odysseus, waster of cities.”"
12646,BOOK XXIV.,
12647,BOOK XXIV.,"Then the ghost of Amphimedon answered him, and spake: “Most famous son"
12648,BOOK XXIV.,"of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, I remember all these things, O"
12649,BOOK XXIV.,"fosterling of Zeus, as thou declarest them, and I in turn will tell"
12650,BOOK XXIV.,"thee all the tale well and truly, even our death and evil end, on what"
12651,BOOK XXIV.,"wise it befell. We wooed the wife of Odysseus that was long afar, and"
12652,BOOK XXIV.,"she neither refused the hated bridal nor was minded to make an end,"
12653,BOOK XXIV.,devising for us death and black fate. Also this other wile she
12654,BOOK XXIV.,"contrived in her heart. She set up in her halls a mighty web, fine of"
12655,BOOK XXIV.,"woof and very wide, whereat she would weave, and anon she spake among"
12656,BOOK XXIV.,us:
12657,BOOK XXIV.,
12658,BOOK XXIV.,"“‘Ye princely youths, my wooers, now that goodly Odysseus is dead, do"
12659,BOOK XXIV.,"ye abide patiently, how eager soever to speed on this marriage of mine,"
12660,BOOK XXIV.,till I finish the robe. I would not that the threads perish to no
12661,BOOK XXIV.,"avail, even this shroud for the hero Laertes, against the day when the"
12662,BOOK XXIV.,"ruinous doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at their"
12663,BOOK XXIV.,length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land count it blame
12664,BOOK XXIV.,"in me, as well might be, were he to lie without a winding-sheet, a man"
12665,BOOK XXIV.,that had gotten great possessions.’
12666,BOOK XXIV.,
12667,BOOK XXIV.,"“So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So then in the"
12668,BOOK XXIV.,"daytime she would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the"
12669,BOOK XXIV.,"same, when she had let place the torches by her. Thus for the space of"
12670,BOOK XXIV.,three years she hid the thing by guile and won the minds of the
12671,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaeans; but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round,"
12672,BOOK XXIV.,"as the months waned and many days were accomplished, then it was that"
12673,BOOK XXIV.,"one of her women who knew all declared it, and we found her unravelling"
12674,BOOK XXIV.,the splendid web. Thus she finished it perforce and sore against her
12675,BOOK XXIV.,"will. Now when she brought the robe to light, after she had woven the"
12676,BOOK XXIV.,"great web and washed it, and it shone even as sun or moon, at that very"
12677,BOOK XXIV.,"hour some evil god led Odysseus, I know not whence, to the upland farm,"
12678,BOOK XXIV.,where the swineherd abode in his dwelling. Thither too came the dear
12679,BOOK XXIV.,"son of divine Odysseus out of sandy Pylos, voyaging with his black"
12680,BOOK XXIV.,"ship. These twain framed an evil death for the wooers, and came to the"
12681,BOOK XXIV.,"renowned town. Odysseus verily came the later, and Telemachus went"
12682,BOOK XXIV.,before and led the way. Now the swineherd brought Odysseus clad in vile
12683,BOOK XXIV.,"raiment, in the likeness of a beggar, a wretched man and an old,"
12684,BOOK XXIV.,"leaning on a staff, and behold, he was clad about in sorry raiment. And"
12685,BOOK XXIV.,"none of us, not even the elders, could know him for that he was, on"
12686,BOOK XXIV.,"this his sudden appearing, but with evil words we assailed him and"
12687,BOOK XXIV.,hurled things at him. Yet for a while he hardened his heart to endure
12688,BOOK XXIV.,"both the hurlings and the evil words in his own halls; but at the last,"
12689,BOOK XXIV.,"when the spirit of Zeus, lord of the aegis, aroused him, by the help of"
12690,BOOK XXIV.,"Telemachus he took up all the goodly weapons, and laid them by in the"
12691,BOOK XXIV.,inner chamber and drew the bolts. Next in his great craft he bade his
12692,BOOK XXIV.,wife to offer his bow and store of grey iron to the wooers to be the
12693,BOOK XXIV.,"weapons of our contest, luckless that we were, and the beginning of"
12694,BOOK XXIV.,death. Now not one of us could stretch the string of the strong bow;
12695,BOOK XXIV.,far short we fell of that might. But when the great bow came to the
12696,BOOK XXIV.,"hands of Odysseus, then we all clamoured and forbade to give him the"
12697,BOOK XXIV.,"bow, how much soever he might speak, but Telemachus alone was instant"
12698,BOOK XXIV.,with him and commanded him to take it. Then he took the bow into his
12699,BOOK XXIV.,"hands, the steadfast goodly Odysseus, and lightly he strung it, and"
12700,BOOK XXIV.,sent the arrow through the iron. Then straight he went to the threshold
12701,BOOK XXIV.,"and there took his stand, and poured forth the swift arrows, glancing"
12702,BOOK XXIV.,"terribly around, and smote the king Antinous. Thereafter on the others"
12703,BOOK XXIV.,"he let fly his bolts, winged for death, with straight aim, and the"
12704,BOOK XXIV.,wooers fell thick one upon another. Then was it known how that some god
12705,BOOK XXIV.,"was their helper, for pressing on as their passion drave them, they"
12706,BOOK XXIV.,"slew the men right and left through the halls, and thence there arose a"
12707,BOOK XXIV.,"hideous moaning, as heads were smitten and the floor all ran with"
12708,BOOK XXIV.,"blood. So we perished, Agamemnon, and even now our bodies lie uncared"
12709,BOOK XXIV.,"for in the halls of Odysseus, for the friends of each one at home as"
12710,BOOK XXIV.,"yet know nought, even they who might wash the black-clotted blood out"
12711,BOOK XXIV.,"of our wounds, and lay out the bodies and wail the dirge, for that is"
12712,BOOK XXIV.,the due of the dead.”
12713,BOOK XXIV.,
12714,BOOK XXIV.,"Then the ghost of the son of Atreus answered him: “Ah, happy son of"
12715,BOOK XXIV.,"Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, yea, for a wife most excellent hast"
12716,BOOK XXIV.,"thou gotten, so good was the wisdom of constant Penelope, daughter of"
12717,BOOK XXIV.,"Icarius, that was duly mindful of Odysseus, her wedded lord. Wherefore"
12718,BOOK XXIV.,"the fame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals will make"
12719,BOOK XXIV.,a gracious song in the ears of men on earth to the fame of constant
12720,BOOK XXIV.,Penelope. In far other wise did the daughter of Tyndareus devise ill
12721,BOOK XXIV.,"deeds, and slay her wedded lord, and hateful shall the song of her be"
12722,BOOK XXIV.,"among men, and an evil repute hath she brought upon all womankind, even"
12723,BOOK XXIV.,on the upright.”
12724,BOOK XXIV.,
12725,BOOK XXIV.,"Even so these twain spake one to the other, standing in the house of"
12726,BOOK XXIV.,"Hades, beneath the secret places of the earth."
12727,BOOK XXIV.,
12728,BOOK XXIV.,"Now when those others had gone down from the city, quickly they came to"
12729,BOOK XXIV.,"the rich and well-ordered farm land of Laertes, that he had won for"
12730,BOOK XXIV.,"himself of old, as the prize of great toil in war. There was his house,"
12731,BOOK XXIV.,and all about it ran the huts wherein the thralls were wont to eat and
12732,BOOK XXIV.,"dwell and sleep, bondsmen that worked his will. And in the house there"
12733,BOOK XXIV.,"was an old Sicilian woman, who diligently cared for the old man, in the"
12734,BOOK XXIV.,upland far from the city. There Odysseus spake to his thralls and to
12735,BOOK XXIV.,"his son, saying:"
12736,BOOK XXIV.,
12737,BOOK XXIV.,"“Do ye now get you within the well-builded house, and quickly sacrifice"
12738,BOOK XXIV.,"the best of the swine for the midday meal, but I will make trial of my"
12739,BOOK XXIV.,"father, whether he will know me again and be aware of me when he sees"
12740,BOOK XXIV.,"me, or know me not, so long have I been away,”"
12741,BOOK XXIV.,
12742,BOOK XXIV.,Therewith he gave the thralls his weapons of war. Then they went
12743,BOOK XXIV.,"speedily to the house, while Odysseus drew near to the fruitful"
12744,BOOK XXIV.,"vineyard to make trial of his father. Now he found not Dolius there, as"
12745,BOOK XXIV.,"he went down into the great garden, nor any of the thralls nor of their"
12746,BOOK XXIV.,sons. It chanced that they had all gone to gather stones for a garden
12747,BOOK XXIV.,"fence, and the old man at their head. So he found his father alone in"
12748,BOOK XXIV.,"the terraced vineyard, digging about a plant. He was clothed in a"
12749,BOOK XXIV.,"filthy doublet, patched and unseemly, with clouted leggings of oxhide"
12750,BOOK XXIV.,"bound about his legs, against the scratches of the thorns, and long"
12751,BOOK XXIV.,"sleeves over his hands by reason of the brambles, and on his head he"
12752,BOOK XXIV.,"wore a goatskin cap, and so he nursed his sorrow. Now when the"
12753,BOOK XXIV.,steadfast goodly Odysseus saw his father thus wasted with age and in
12754,BOOK XXIV.,"great grief of heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree and let"
12755,BOOK XXIV.,"fall a tear. Then he communed with his heart and soul, whether he"
12756,BOOK XXIV.,"should fall on his father’s neck and kiss him, and tell him all, how he"
12757,BOOK XXIV.,"had returned and come to his own country, or whether he should first"
12758,BOOK XXIV.,question him and prove him in every word. And as he thought within
12759,BOOK XXIV.,"himself, this seemed to him the better way, namely, first to prove his"
12760,BOOK XXIV.,father and speak to him sharply. So with this intent the goodly
12761,BOOK XXIV.,Odysseus went up to him. Now he was holding his head down and kept
12762,BOOK XXIV.,"digging about the plant, while his renowned son stood by him and spake,"
12763,BOOK XXIV.,saying:
12764,BOOK XXIV.,
12765,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old man, thou hast no lack of skill in tending a garden; lo, thou"
12766,BOOK XXIV.,"carest well for all,[42] nor is there aught whatsoever, either plant or"
12767,BOOK XXIV.,"fig-tree, or vine, yea, or olive, or pear, or garden-bed in all the"
12768,BOOK XXIV.,"close, that is not well seen to. Yet another thing will I tell thee and"
12769,BOOK XXIV.,lay not up wrath thereat in thy heart. Thyself art scarce so well cared
12770,BOOK XXIV.,"for, but a pitiful old age is on thee, and withal thou art withered and"
12771,BOOK XXIV.,"unkempt, and clad unseemly. It cannot be to punish thy sloth that thy"
12772,BOOK XXIV.,master cares not for thee; there shows nothing of the slave about thy
12773,BOOK XXIV.,"face and stature, for thou art like a kingly man, even like one who"
12774,BOOK XXIV.,"should lie soft, when he has washed and eaten well, as is the manner of"
12775,BOOK XXIV.,the aged. But come declare me this and plainly tell it all. Whose
12776,BOOK XXIV.,"thrall art thou, and whose garden dost thou tend? Tell me moreover"
12777,BOOK XXIV.,"truly, that I may surely know, if it be indeed to Ithaca that I am now"
12778,BOOK XXIV.,"come, as one yonder told me who met with me but now on the way hither."
12779,BOOK XXIV.,"He was but of little understanding, for he deigned not to tell me all"
12780,BOOK XXIV.,"nor to heed my saying, when I questioned him concerning my friend,"
12781,BOOK XXIV.,whether indeed he is yet alive or is even now dead and within the house
12782,BOOK XXIV.,of Hades. For I will declare it and do thou mark and listen: once did I
12783,BOOK XXIV.,"kindly entreat a man in mine own dear country, who came to our home,"
12784,BOOK XXIV.,and never yet has any mortal been dearer of all the strangers that have
12785,BOOK XXIV.,drawn to my house from afar. He declared him to be by lineage from out
12786,BOOK XXIV.,"of Ithaca, and said that his own father was Laertes son of Arceisius."
12787,BOOK XXIV.,"So I led him to our halls and gave him good entertainment, with all"
12788,BOOK XXIV.,"loving-kindness, out of the plenty that was within. Such gifts too I"
12789,BOOK XXIV.,gave him as are the due of guests; of well wrought gold I gave him
12790,BOOK XXIV.,"seven talents, and a mixing bowl of flowered work, all of silver, and"
12791,BOOK XXIV.,"twelve cloaks of single fold, and as many coverlets, and as many goodly"
12792,BOOK XXIV.,"mantles and doublets to boot, and besides all these, four women skilled"
12793,BOOK XXIV.,"in all fair works and most comely, the women of his choice.”"
12794,BOOK XXIV.,
12795,BOOK XXIV.,[42] Supplying ὄρχατον from the preceding clause as object to ἔχει.
12796,BOOK XXIV.,Other constructions are possible.
12797,BOOK XXIV.,
12798,BOOK XXIV.,
12799,BOOK XXIV.,"Then his father answered him, weeping: “Stranger, thou art verily come"
12800,BOOK XXIV.,"to that country whereof thou askest, but outrageous men and froward"
12801,BOOK XXIV.,"hold it. And these thy gifts, thy countless gifts, thou didst bestow in"
12802,BOOK XXIV.,vain. For if thou hadst found that man yet living in the land of Ithaca
12803,BOOK XXIV.,"he would have sent thee on thy way with good return of thy presents,"
12804,BOOK XXIV.,"and with all hospitality, as is due to the man that begins the"
12805,BOOK XXIV.,"kindness. But come, declare me this and plainly tell me all; how many"
12806,BOOK XXIV.,"years are passed since thou didst entertain him, thy guest ill-fated"
12807,BOOK XXIV.,"and my child,—if ever such an one there was,—hapless man, whom far from"
12808,BOOK XXIV.,"his friends and his country’s soil, the fishes, it may be, have"
12809,BOOK XXIV.,"devoured in the deep sea, or on the shore he has fallen the prey of"
12810,BOOK XXIV.,"birds and beasts. His mother wept not over him nor clad him for burial,"
12811,BOOK XXIV.,"nor his father, we that begat him. Nor did his bride, whom men sought"
12812,BOOK XXIV.,"with rich gifts, the constant Penelope, bewail her lord upon the bier,"
12813,BOOK XXIV.,"as was meet, nor closed his eyes, as is the due of the departed."
12814,BOOK XXIV.,"Moreover, tell me this truly, that I may surely know, who art thou and"
12815,BOOK XXIV.,whence of the sons of men? Where is thy city and where are they that
12816,BOOK XXIV.,"begat thee? Where now is thy swift ship moored, that brought thee"
12817,BOOK XXIV.,thither with thy godlike company? Hast thou come as a passenger on
12818,BOOK XXIV.,"another’s ship, while they set thee ashore and went away?"
12819,BOOK XXIV.,
12820,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: “Yea now, I will"
12821,BOOK XXIV.,"tell thee all most plainly. From out of Alybas I come, where I dwell in"
12822,BOOK XXIV.,"a house renowned, and am the son of Apheidas the son of Polypemon, the"
12823,BOOK XXIV.,"prince, and my own name is Eperitus. But some god drave me wandering"
12824,BOOK XXIV.,"hither from Sicania against my will, and yonder my ship is moored"
12825,BOOK XXIV.,"toward the upland away from the city. But for Odysseus, this is now the"
12826,BOOK XXIV.,fifth year since he went thence and departed out of my country.
12827,BOOK XXIV.,"Ill-fated was he, and yet he had birds of good omen when he fared away,"
12828,BOOK XXIV.,"birds on the right; wherefore I sped him gladly on his road, and gladly"
12829,BOOK XXIV.,"he departed, and the heart of us twain hoped yet to meet in friendship"
12830,BOOK XXIV.,on a day and to give splendid gifts.”
12831,BOOK XXIV.,
12832,BOOK XXIV.,"So he spake, and on the old man fell a black cloud of sorrow. With both"
12833,BOOK XXIV.,his hands he clutched the dust and ashes and showered them on his gray
12834,BOOK XXIV.,"head, with ceaseless groaning. Then the heart of Odysseus was moved,"
12835,BOOK XXIV.,and up through his nostrils throbbed anon the keen sting of sorrow at
12836,BOOK XXIV.,the sight of his dear father. And he sprang towards him and fell on his
12837,BOOK XXIV.,"neck and kissed him, saying:"
12838,BOOK XXIV.,
12839,BOOK XXIV.,"“Behold, I here, even I, my father, am the man of whom thou askest; in"
12840,BOOK XXIV.,the twentieth year am I come to mine own country. But stay thy weeping
12841,BOOK XXIV.,"and tearful lamentation, for I will tell thee all clearly, though great"
12842,BOOK XXIV.,need there is of haste. I have slain the wooers in our halls and
12843,BOOK XXIV.,avenged their bitter scorn and evil deeds.”
12844,BOOK XXIV.,
12845,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Laertes answered him and spake, saying: “If thou art indeed"
12846,BOOK XXIV.,"Odysseus, mine own child, that art come hither, show me now a manifest"
12847,BOOK XXIV.,"token, that I may be assured.”"
12848,BOOK XXIV.,
12849,BOOK XXIV.,Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Look first on this
12850,BOOK XXIV.,"scar and consider it, that the boar dealt me with his white tusk on"
12851,BOOK XXIV.,"Parnassus, whither I had gone, and thou didst send me forth, thou and"
12852,BOOK XXIV.,"my lady mother, to Autolycus my mother’s father, to get the gifts which"
12853,BOOK XXIV.,"when he came hither he promised and covenanted to give me. But come,"
12854,BOOK XXIV.,"and I will even tell thee the trees through all the terraced garden,"
12855,BOOK XXIV.,"which thou gavest me once for mine own, and I was begging of thee this"
12856,BOOK XXIV.,"and that, being but a little child, and following thee through the"
12857,BOOK XXIV.,"garden. Through these very trees we were going, and thou didst tell me"
12858,BOOK XXIV.,the names of each of them. Pear-trees thirteen thou gavest me and ten
12859,BOOK XXIV.,"apple-trees and figs two-score, and, as we went, thou didst name the"
12860,BOOK XXIV.,"fifty rows of vines thou wouldest give me, whereof each one ripened at"
12861,BOOK XXIV.,"divers times, with all manner of clusters on their boughs, when the"
12862,BOOK XXIV.,seasons of Zeus wrought mightily on them from on high.”
12863,BOOK XXIV.,
12864,BOOK XXIV.,"So he spake, and straightway his knees were loosened, and his heart"
12865,BOOK XXIV.,"melted within him, as he knew the sure tokens that Odysseus showed him."
12866,BOOK XXIV.,"About his dear son he cast his arms, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus"
12867,BOOK XXIV.,caught him fainting to his breast. Now when he had got breath and his
12868,BOOK XXIV.,"spirit came to him again, once more he answered and spake, saying:"
12869,BOOK XXIV.,
12870,BOOK XXIV.,"“Father Zeus, verily ye gods yet bear sway on high Olympus, if indeed"
12871,BOOK XXIV.,the wooers have paid for their infatuate pride! But now my heart is
12872,BOOK XXIV.,"terribly afraid, lest straightway all the men of Ithaca come up against"
12873,BOOK XXIV.,"us here, and haste to send messengers everywhere to the cities of the"
12874,BOOK XXIV.,Cephallenians.”
12875,BOOK XXIV.,
12876,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: “Take courage, and"
12877,BOOK XXIV.,"let not thy heart be careful about these matters. But come, let us go"
12878,BOOK XXIV.,"to the house that lies near the garden, for thither I sent forward"
12879,BOOK XXIV.,Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd to get ready the meal as
12880,BOOK XXIV.,speedily as may be.”
12881,BOOK XXIV.,
12882,BOOK XXIV.,After these words the twain set out to the goodly halls. Now when they
12883,BOOK XXIV.,"had come to the fair-lying house, they found Telemachus and the"
12884,BOOK XXIV.,"neatherd and the swineherd carving much flesh, and mixing the dark"
12885,BOOK XXIV.,wine. Meanwhile the Sicilian handmaid bathed high-hearted Laertes in
12886,BOOK XXIV.,"his house, and anointed him with olive-oil, and cast a fair mantle"
12887,BOOK XXIV.,"about him. Then Athene drew nigh, and made greater the limbs of the"
12888,BOOK XXIV.,"shepherd of the people, taller she made him than before and mightier to"
12889,BOOK XXIV.,"behold. Then he went forth from the bath, and his dear son marvelled at"
12890,BOOK XXIV.,"him, beholding him like to the deathless gods in presence. And uttering"
12891,BOOK XXIV.,his voice he spake to him winged words:
12892,BOOK XXIV.,
12893,BOOK XXIV.,"“Father, surely one of the gods that are from everlasting hath made"
12894,BOOK XXIV.,thee goodlier and greater to behold.”
12895,BOOK XXIV.,
12896,BOOK XXIV.,"Then wise Laertes answered him, saying: “Ah, would to father Zeus and"
12897,BOOK XXIV.,"Athene and Apollo, that such as I was when I took Nericus, the"
12898,BOOK XXIV.,"stablished castle on the foreland of the continent, being then the"
12899,BOOK XXIV.,"prince of the Cephallenians, would that in such might, and with mail"
12900,BOOK XXIV.,"about my shoulders, I had stood to aid thee yesterday in our house, and"
12901,BOOK XXIV.,to beat back the wooers; so should I have loosened the knees of many an
12902,BOOK XXIV.,"one of them in the halls, and thou shouldest have been gladdened in"
12903,BOOK XXIV.,thine inmost heart!”
12904,BOOK XXIV.,
12905,BOOK XXIV.,So they spake each with the other. But when the others had ceased from
12906,BOOK XXIV.,"their task and made ready the feast, they sat down all orderly on"
12907,BOOK XXIV.,chairs and on high seats. Then they began to put forth their hands on
12908,BOOK XXIV.,"the meat, and the old man Dolius drew nigh, and the old man’s sons"
12909,BOOK XXIV.,"withal came tired from their labour in the fields, for their mother,"
12910,BOOK XXIV.,"the aged Sicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she that saw"
12911,BOOK XXIV.,"to their living and diligently cared for the old man, now that old age"
12912,BOOK XXIV.,had laid hold on him. So soon as they looked on Odysseus and took
12913,BOOK XXIV.,"knowledge of him, they stood still in the halls in great amazement. But"
12914,BOOK XXIV.,"Odysseus addressed them in gentle words, saying:"
12915,BOOK XXIV.,
12916,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old man, sit down to meat and do ye forget your marvelling, for long"
12917,BOOK XXIV.,"have we been eager to put forth our hands on the food, as we abode in"
12918,BOOK XXIV.,the hall alway expecting your coming.”
12919,BOOK XXIV.,
12920,BOOK XXIV.,"So he spake, and Dolius ran straight toward him stretching forth both"
12921,BOOK XXIV.,"his hands, and he grasped the hand of Odysseus and kissed it on the"
12922,BOOK XXIV.,"wrist, and uttering his voice spake to him winged words:"
12923,BOOK XXIV.,
12924,BOOK XXIV.,"“Beloved, forasmuch as thou hast come back to us who sore desired thee,"
12925,BOOK XXIV.,"and no longer thought to see thee, and the gods have led thee home"
12926,BOOK XXIV.,"again;—hail to thee and welcome manifold, and may the gods give thee"
12927,BOOK XXIV.,"all good fortune! Moreover tell me this truly, that I may be assured,"
12928,BOOK XXIV.,"whether wise Penelope yet knows well that thou hast come back hither,"
12929,BOOK XXIV.,or whether we shall dispatch a messenger.”
12930,BOOK XXIV.,
12931,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered saying: “Old man, already she"
12932,BOOK XXIV.,knows all; what need to busy thyself herewith?”
12933,BOOK XXIV.,
12934,BOOK XXIV.,Thereon the other sat him down again on his polished settle. And in
12935,BOOK XXIV.,"like wise the sons of Dolius gathered about the renowned Odysseus, and"
12936,BOOK XXIV.,"greeted him well and clasped his hands, and then sat down all orderly"
12937,BOOK XXIV.,by Dolius their father.
12938,BOOK XXIV.,
12939,BOOK XXIV.,So they were busy with the meal in the halls. Now Rumour the messenger
12940,BOOK XXIV.,"went swiftly all about the city, telling the tale of the dire death and"
12941,BOOK XXIV.,"fate of the wooers. And the people heard it, and all at once gathered"
12942,BOOK XXIV.,together from every side with sighing and groaning before the house of
12943,BOOK XXIV.,"Odysseus. And each brought forth his dead from the halls, and buried"
12944,BOOK XXIV.,them; but those that came out of other cities they placed on swift
12945,BOOK XXIV.,"ships and sent with fisherfolk, each to be carried to his own home. As"
12946,BOOK XXIV.,"for them they all fared together to the assembly-place, in sorrow of"
12947,BOOK XXIV.,"heart. When they were all gathered and come together, Eupeithes arose"
12948,BOOK XXIV.,"and spake among them, for a comfortless grief lay heavy on his heart"
12949,BOOK XXIV.,"for his son Antinous, the first man that goodly Odysseus had slain."
12950,BOOK XXIV.,Weeping for him he made harangue and spake among them:
12951,BOOK XXIV.,
12952,BOOK XXIV.,"“Friends, a great deed truly hath this man devised against the"
12953,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaeans. Some with his ships he led away, many men, and noble, and his"
12954,BOOK XXIV.,"hollow ships hath he lost, and utterly lost of his company, and others"
12955,BOOK XXIV.,"again, and those far the best of the Cephallenians he hath slain on his"
12956,BOOK XXIV.,"coming home. Up now, before ever he gets him swiftly either to Pylos or"
12957,BOOK XXIV.,"to fair Elis, where the Epeians bear sway, let us go forth; else even"
12958,BOOK XXIV.,hereafter shall we have shame of face for ever. For a scorn this is
12959,BOOK XXIV.,"even for the ears of men unborn to hear, if we avenge not ourselves on"
12960,BOOK XXIV.,the slayers of our sons and of our brethren. Life would no more be
12961,BOOK XXIV.,"sweet to me, but rather would I die straightway and be with the"
12962,BOOK XXIV.,"departed. Up, let us be going, lest these fellows be beforehand with us"
12963,BOOK XXIV.,and get them over the sea.”
12964,BOOK XXIV.,
12965,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus he spake weeping, and pity fell on all the Achaeans. Then came"
12966,BOOK XXIV.,"near to them Medon and the divine minstrel, forth from the halls of"
12967,BOOK XXIV.,"Odysseus, for that sleep had let them go. They stood in the midst of"
12968,BOOK XXIV.,"the gathering, and amazement seized every man. Then Medon, wise of"
12969,BOOK XXIV.,"heart, spake among them, saying:"
12970,BOOK XXIV.,
12971,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, for surely Odysseus planned not"
12972,BOOK XXIV.,these deeds without the will of the gods. Nay I myself beheld a god
12973,BOOK XXIV.,"immortal, who stood hard by Odysseus, in the perfect semblance of"
12974,BOOK XXIV.,"Mentor; now as a deathless god was he manifest in front of Odysseus,"
12975,BOOK XXIV.,"cheering him, and yet again scaring the wooers he stormed through the"
12976,BOOK XXIV.,"hall, and they fell thick one on another.”"
12977,BOOK XXIV.,
12978,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus he spake, and pale fear gat hold of the limbs of all. Then the old"
12979,BOOK XXIV.,"man, the lord Halitherses, spake among them, the son of Mastor, for he"
12980,BOOK XXIV.,alone saw before and after. Out of his good will be made harangue and
12981,BOOK XXIV.,"spake among them, saying:"
12982,BOOK XXIV.,
12983,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I will say."
12984,BOOK XXIV.,"Through your own cowardice, my friends, have these deeds come to pass."
12985,BOOK XXIV.,"For ye obeyed not me, nor Mentor, the shepherd of the people, to make"
12986,BOOK XXIV.,your sons cease from their foolish ways. A great villainy they wrought
12987,BOOK XXIV.,"in their evil infatuation, wasting the wealth and holding in no regard"
12988,BOOK XXIV.,"the wife of a prince, while they deemed that he would never more come"
12989,BOOK XXIV.,"home. And now let things be on this wise, and obey my counsel. Let us"
12990,BOOK XXIV.,"not go forth against him, lest haply some may find a bane of their own"
12991,BOOK XXIV.,bringing.”
12992,BOOK XXIV.,
12993,BOOK XXIV.,"So he spake, but they leapt up with a great cry, the more part of them,"
12994,BOOK XXIV.,while the rest abode there together; for his counsel was not to the
12995,BOOK XXIV.,"mind of the more part, but they gave ear to Eupeithes, and swiftly"
12996,BOOK XXIV.,thereafter they rushed for their armour. So when they had arrayed them
12997,BOOK XXIV.,"in shining mail, they assembled together in front of the spacious town."
12998,BOOK XXIV.,"And Eupeithes led them in his witlessness, for he thought to avenge the"
12999,BOOK XXIV.,"slaying of his son, yet himself was never to return, but then and there"
13000,BOOK XXIV.,to meet his doom.
13001,BOOK XXIV.,
13002,BOOK XXIV.,"Now Athene spake to Zeus, the son of Cronos, saying: “O Father, our"
13003,BOOK XXIV.,"father Cronides, throned in the highest, answer and tell me what is now"
13004,BOOK XXIV.,the hidden counsel of thy heart? Wilt thou yet further rouse up evil
13005,BOOK XXIV.,"war and the terrible din of battle, or art thou minded to set them at"
13006,BOOK XXIV.,one again in friendship?”
13007,BOOK XXIV.,
13008,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, answered her saying: “My child,"
13009,BOOK XXIV.,"why dost thou thus straitly question me, and ask me this? Nay didst not"
13010,BOOK XXIV.,"thou thyself devise this very thought, namely, that Odysseus should"
13011,BOOK XXIV.,"indeed take vengeance on these men at his coming? Do as thou wilt, but"
13012,BOOK XXIV.,I will tell thee of the better way. Now that goodly Odysseus hath
13013,BOOK XXIV.,"wreaked vengeance on the wooers, let them make a firm covenant together"
13014,BOOK XXIV.,"with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring"
13015,BOOK XXIV.,about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren; so
13016,BOOK XXIV.,"may both sides love one another as of old, and let peace and wealth"
13017,BOOK XXIV.,abundant be their portion.”
13018,BOOK XXIV.,
13019,BOOK XXIV.,"Therewith he roused Athene to yet greater eagerness, and from the peaks"
13020,BOOK XXIV.,of Olympus she came glancing down.
13021,BOOK XXIV.,
13022,BOOK XXIV.,"Now when they had put from them the desire of honey-sweet food, the"
13023,BOOK XXIV.,"steadfast goodly Odysseus began to speak among them, saying:"
13024,BOOK XXIV.,
13025,BOOK XXIV.,"“Let one go forth and see, lest the people be already drawing near"
13026,BOOK XXIV.,against us.”
13027,BOOK XXIV.,
13028,BOOK XXIV.,"So he spake, and the son of Dolius went forth at his bidding, and stood"
13029,BOOK XXIV.,on the outer threshold and saw them all close at hand. Then straightway
13030,BOOK XXIV.,he spake to Odysseus winged words:
13031,BOOK XXIV.,
13032,BOOK XXIV.,"“Here they be, close upon us! Quick, let us to arms!”"
13033,BOOK XXIV.,
13034,BOOK XXIV.,"Thereon they rose up and arrayed them in their harness, Odysseus and"
13035,BOOK XXIV.,"his men being four, and the six sons of Dolius, and likewise Laertes"
13036,BOOK XXIV.,"and Dolius did on their armour, grey-headed as they were, warriors"
13037,BOOK XXIV.,"through stress of need. Now when they had clad them in shining mail,"
13038,BOOK XXIV.,they opened the gates and went forth and Odysseus led them.
13039,BOOK XXIV.,
13040,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the likeness of"
13041,BOOK XXIV.,"Mentor, in fashion and in voice. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus"
13042,BOOK XXIV.,"beheld her and was glad, and straightway he spake to Telemachus his"
13043,BOOK XXIV.,dear son:
13044,BOOK XXIV.,
13045,BOOK XXIV.,"“Telemachus, soon shalt thou learn this, when thou thyself art got to"
13046,BOOK XXIV.,"the place of the battle where the best men try the issue,—namely, not"
13047,BOOK XXIV.,"to bring shame on thy father’s house, on us who in time past have been"
13048,BOOK XXIV.,eminent for might and hardihood over all the world.”
13049,BOOK XXIV.,
13050,BOOK XXIV.,"Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: “Thou shalt see me, if thou"
13051,BOOK XXIV.,"wilt, dear father, in this my mood no whit disgracing thy line,"
13052,BOOK XXIV.,according to thy word.”
13053,BOOK XXIV.,
13054,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake he, and Laertes was glad and spake, saying: “What a day has"
13055,BOOK XXIV.,"dawned for me, kind gods; yea, a glad man am I! My son and my son’s son"
13056,BOOK XXIV.,are vying with one another in valour.”
13057,BOOK XXIV.,
13058,BOOK XXIV.,"Then grey-eyed Athene stood beside Laertes, and spake to him: “O son of"
13059,BOOK XXIV.,"Arceisius that art far the dearest of all my friends, pray first to the"
13060,BOOK XXIV.,"grey-eyed maid and to father Zeus, then swing thy long spear aloft and"
13061,BOOK XXIV.,hurl its straightway.”
13062,BOOK XXIV.,
13063,BOOK XXIV.,Therewith Pallas Athene breathed into him great strength. Then he
13064,BOOK XXIV.,"prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus, and straightway swung his long"
13065,BOOK XXIV.,"spear aloft and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through his casque with"
13066,BOOK XXIV.,the cheek-piece of bronze. The armour kept not out the spear that went
13067,BOOK XXIV.,"clean through, and he fell with a crash, and his arms rattled about his"
13068,BOOK XXIV.,"body. Then Odysseus and his renowned son fell on the fore-fighters, and"
13069,BOOK XXIV.,smote them with swords and two-headed spears. And now would they have
13070,BOOK XXIV.,"slain them all and cut off their return, had not Athene called aloud,"
13071,BOOK XXIV.,"the daughter of Zeus lord of the aegis, and stayed all the host of the"
13072,BOOK XXIV.,"enemy, saying:"
13073,BOOK XXIV.,
13074,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hold your hands from fierce fighting, ye men of Ithaca, that so ye may"
13075,BOOK XXIV.,"be parted quickly, without bloodshed.”"
13076,BOOK XXIV.,
13077,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake Athene, and pale fear gat hold of them all. The arms flew from"
13078,BOOK XXIV.,"their hands in their terror and fell all upon the ground, as the"
13079,BOOK XXIV.,"goddess uttered her voice. To the city they turned their steps, as men"
13080,BOOK XXIV.,"fain of life, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus with a terrible cry"
13081,BOOK XXIV.,"gathered himself together and hurled in on them, like an eagle of lofty"
13082,BOOK XXIV.,"flight. Then in that hour the son of Cronos cast forth a flaming bolt,"
13083,BOOK XXIV.,"and it fell at the feet of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of the"
13084,BOOK XXIV.,"mighty Sire. Then grey-eyed Athene spake to Odysseus, saying:"
13085,BOOK XXIV.,
13086,BOOK XXIV.,"“Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, refrain"
13087,BOOK XXIV.,"thee now and stay the strife of even-handed war, lest perchance the son"
13088,BOOK XXIV.,"of Cronos be angry with thee, even Zeus of the far-borne voice.”"
13089,BOOK XXIV.,
13090,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake Athene, and he obeyed and was glad at heart. And thereafter"
13091,BOOK XXIV.,"Pallas Athene set a covenant between them with sacrifice, she, the"
13092,BOOK XXIV.,"daughter of Zeus lord of the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor, both in"
13093,BOOK XXIV.,fashion and in voice.
13094,BOOK XXIV.,
13095,BOOK XXIV.,
13096,BOOK XXIV.,
13097,BOOK XXIV.,"Homer, thy song men liken to the sea,"
13098,BOOK XXIV.,"With every note of music in his tone,"
13099,BOOK XXIV.,With tides that wash the dim dominion
13100,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Hades, and light waves that laugh in glee"
13101,BOOK XXIV.,"Around the isles enchanted: nay, to me"
13102,BOOK XXIV.,Thy verse seems as the River of source unknown
13103,BOOK XXIV.,"That glasses Egypt’s temples overthrown,"
13104,BOOK XXIV.,"In his sky-nurtur’d stream, eternally."
13105,BOOK XXIV.,No wiser we than men of heretofore
13106,BOOK XXIV.,To find thy mystic fountains guarded fast;
13107,BOOK XXIV.,Enough—thy flood makes green our human shore
13108,BOOK XXIV.,"As Nilus, Egypt, rolling down his vast,"
13109,BOOK XXIV.,"His fertile waters, murmuring evermore"
13110,BOOK XXIV.,"Of gods dethroned, and empires of the Past."
