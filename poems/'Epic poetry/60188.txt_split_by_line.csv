13,,
14,,This book was transcribed from scans of several different copies of the
15,,original found at the Internet Archive. The typesetters of the original
16,,book represented the letter ā (with a macron above) as â (with
17,,"circumflex above) when italicized, but this etext uses the macron"
18,,throughout. Words in italics in this etext were italicized in the
19,,original book. I have corrected obvious misspellings but I’ve left
20,,"variant spellings alone. Some words and names, like _yojana_ and"
21,,"_Gāruda_, were spelled two different ways in the same text. I have"
22,,spelled them consistently to avoid confusion.

192,SECTION I.,
193,SECTION I.,
194,SECTION I.,"Hearing the words of Hanumān rehearsed properly, Rāma, exceedingly"
195,SECTION I.,"delighted, said,—""By Hanumān hath been performed a very great deed, rare"
196,SECTION I.,"on earth, and one incapable of being even conceived by any other in the"
197,SECTION I.,"world. Save Gāruda and the Wind-god, and save also Hanumān, him find I"
198,SECTION I.,not who crosseth the wide ocean. Entering by main force the city of
199,SECTION I.,"Lankā, incapable of being subjugated by the gods and Dānavas and"
200,SECTION I.,"Yakshas, the Gandharbas, serpents or Rakhas, and well protected by"
201,SECTION I.,"Rāvana,—who, living, cometh out (of it)? And who that is not the compeer"
202,SECTION I.,"of Hanumān in strength and prowess, even entereth into (Lankā), hard to"
203,SECTION I.,"subdue, and carefully guarded by the Rākshasas? And having so put forth"
204,SECTION I.,"his strength commensurate with his prowess, Hanumān hath also performed"
205,SECTION I.,"a great act befitting a servant on behalf of Sugriva.¹ That servant who,"
206,SECTION I.,"being entrusted with a hard task,—after having accomplished it, doeth"
207,SECTION I.,"another work in pursuance of (the prescribed business), is the best of"
208,SECTION I.,"men. That servant is middling, who, deputed to any task,² doth not,"
209,SECTION I.,"albeit capable, perform any other work which may be dear to the king."
210,SECTION I.,"And that servant who, entrusted with any work the king, doth not,"
211,SECTION I.,"although competent, heedfully accomplish the same, hath been called the"
212,SECTION I.,"worst. Anent the order (which he had received), Hanumān hath done the"
213,SECTION I.,"work (and more). He hath not been humbled,³—and, further, hath pleased"
214,SECTION I.,"Sugriva. And by seeing Vaidehi, (Hanumān hath), while reaping"
215,SECTION I.,"righteousness, saved me, the Raghu race, and the highly powerful"
216,SECTION I.,"Lakshmana. And this pained my mind sore, that I cannot do a like"
217,SECTION I.,"benefit, returning this dear office of his. Embrace expresseth the all"
218,SECTION I.,"(of the Deity),⁴ and, finding this occasion, I extend my embrace unto"
219,SECTION I.,"the high-souled Hanumān"". Having said this, Rāma, with his down standing"
220,SECTION I.,"on end in joy, embraced the self-controlled Hanumān, who was present"
221,SECTION I.,"after having finished his speech. Then reflecting for a while, the best"
222,SECTION I.,"of the Raghus again spoke in the presence of Sugriva, lord of monkeys."
223,SECTION I.,"""Complete success hath been attained anent the search for Sitā. But when"
224,SECTION I.,"I think of the ocean, my mind is again sunk in dejection. How can the"
225,SECTION I.,"assembled monkeys go over to the southern shore of the vasty deep,"
226,SECTION I.,difficult to cross? This tidings thou hast related unto me touching
227,SECTION I.,"Vadehi, but what are the monkeys to do next about crossing the sea?"""
228,SECTION I.,"Having said this unto Hanumān, that slayer of foes, mighty-armed Rāma,"
229,SECTION I.,"agitated by anxiety, was then plunged in thought."
230,SECTION I.,
231,SECTION I.,¹ Having seen Sitā—which was all that he had been commissioned to do
232,SECTION I.,"by Sugriva, Hanumān has destroyed Rākshasas and burnt Lankā; and"
233,SECTION I.,this he did of himself like a good servant.—T.
234,SECTION I.,
235,SECTION I.,² i.e. _performing the entrusted work.—T._
236,SECTION I.,
237,SECTION I.,³ _By the Rākskasas.—T._
238,SECTION I.,
239,SECTION I.,⁴ The commentator explains this obscure passage after his own
240,SECTION I.,orthodox fashion. The gist is this. Delight is the essence of the
241,SECTION I.,"Deity, and all His incarnations body forth this. Embrace is"
242,SECTION I.,typical of this emotion.—T.
243,SECTION I.,
244,SECTION I.,
245,SECTION I.,
246,SECTION II.,SECTION II.
247,SECTION II.,
248,SECTION II.,
249,SECTION II.,"Then the graceful Sugriva spake words capable of soothing sorrow, unto"
250,SECTION II.,"Daçaratha’s son, Rāma, who was wrought up with grief,—""Why, O hero, dost"
251,SECTION II.,"thou grieve, like one that is base? Let not this be so. Chase away thy"
252,SECTION II.,"grief, even as an ingrate resigneth amity. Nor, O Rāghava, when the"
253,SECTION II.,"whereabouts of Sitā hath been discovered, and when too the abode itself"
254,SECTION II.,"of the foe hath been known, do I perceive the reason of thy sorrow."
255,SECTION II.,"Thou, O Rāghava, art intelligent, conversant with learning, wise, and"
256,SECTION II.,"judicious. Do thou cast away this sorry way of thinking, even as a"
257,SECTION II.,self-controlled (ascetic) casteth away any course of thought interfering
258,SECTION II.,with the attainment of his purpose. Crossing over the ocean swarming
259,SECTION II.,"with gigantic alligators, we shall enter Lankā and slay thy enemy. Of a"
260,SECTION II.,person that is dispirited and poor in pluck and that hath his soul
261,SECTION II.,"overwhelmed with grief, every interest droopeth, and he cometh by"
262,SECTION II.,"misfortunes (one after another). All these heroes, these leaders of"
263,SECTION II.,"monkey-hordes, who are ardent for thy welfare, are competent to enter"
264,SECTION II.,"into fire itself. From their cheerful attitude I know this, and firm is"
265,SECTION II.,"my faith. It behoveth thee so to arrange things that, slaying the foe,"
266,SECTION II.,"Rāvana of impious acts, we may bring hither Sitā by our own prowess. Do"
267,SECTION II.,"thou, O Rāghava, so order matters that a bridge may be constructed (over"
268,SECTION II.,"the main), and that we may behold the palace of the Rākshasa monarch. We"
269,SECTION II.,"having seen the city of Lankā, established on the summit of Trikuta, do"
270,SECTION II.,thou for certain conclude Rāvana as slain in battle immediately after
271,SECTION II.,(we see her). Without throwing a bridge over the ocean—the dread abode
272,SECTION II.,of Varuna—even the Asuras and celestials with Indra (at their head) are
273,SECTION II.,unequal to subduing Lankā. When the bridge over the ocean hath been
274,SECTION II.,"constructed up to near Lankā, and when my forces have crossed (over the"
275,SECTION II.,"sea), consider victory as secured. As these monkeys are heroic in fight,"
276,SECTION II.,"and able to wear forms at will, O king, do not let thy intellect get"
277,SECTION II.,"stupified and thus mar all interests. In this world, sorrow berefts"
278,SECTION II.,people of their prowess. Do thou do even what should be done by a
279,SECTION II.,"man—summon thy manliness; for what an actor doeth promptly, conduceth to"
280,SECTION II.,"his success. At this time, O eminently wise one, do thou realise"
281,SECTION II.,"goodness through thy energy.⁵ Of heroic, high-souled, men like thyself,"
282,SECTION II.,"on their sustaining an entire or a partial loss, grief undoeth every"
283,SECTION II.,"interest. Therefore, the foremost of intelligent persons, and conversant"
284,SECTION II.,"with every lore, thou shouldst along with councilors like me, strive to"
285,SECTION II.,"beat thy foe. Find I none in the three worlds, O Rāghava, who can stay"
286,SECTION II.,in fight before thee equipped with thy bow. Thy business entrusted to
287,SECTION II.,"these monkeys shall not (anyway) suffer. And soon, crossing over the"
288,SECTION II.,"boundless main, thou shalt behold Sitā. Therefore, O king, renounce thy"
289,SECTION II.,"sorrow, and call up wrath. Those Kshatriyas that conceive no anger in"
290,SECTION II.,"respect of their enemies, have their activity annulled; and all fear"
291,SECTION II.,"furious persons. Drawing nigh unto us, do thou, gifted with acute"
292,SECTION II.,"intelligence, cast about for crossing over the dreadful deep—lord of"
293,SECTION II.,"streams—along with us. On these forces getting beyond the ocean, do thou"
294,SECTION II.,take it for certain that we have won; and when my whole host hath
295,SECTION II.,"reached the further shore, do thou indubitably conclude that we have"
296,SECTION II.,"obtained victory. These monkeys, heroic and capable of assuming in fight"
297,SECTION II.,"forms at will, shall slaughter those foes by showering rocks and trees."
298,SECTION II.,"If I see any means of crossing the ocean, Varuna’s abode, I shall, O"
299,SECTION II.,"destroyer of foes, deem him as slain in battle. And what is the use of"
300,SECTION II.,"dilating? Every way thou shalt prove victorious. And I see omens, and my"
301,SECTION II.,"mind is filled with delight""."
302,SECTION II.,
303,SECTION II.,"⁵ _i.e._ as I understand this rather obscure passage, _prove thou"
304,SECTION II.,good through thy vigor—secure victory to the cause of goodness
305,SECTION II.,through thy might._—T

310,SECTION III.,
311,SECTION III.,
312,SECTION III.,"Hearing Sugriva’s speech, reasonable and fraught with high sense,"
313,SECTION III.,"Kākutstha accorded his assent to it and spoke unto Hanumān, saying,—""By"
314,SECTION III.,"asceticism, or constructing a a bridge, or drying up the"
315,SECTION III.,"ocean,—competent every way am I for crossing over this ocean. Of"
316,SECTION III.,"impracticable places, tell me how many there are in (Lankā), which are"
317,SECTION III.,"incapable of being come at. O monkey, as thou hast seen personally, I"
318,SECTION III.,wish to get acquainted with all this. And thou hast at thy leisure duly
319,SECTION III.,"noticed in Lankā the number of the army, the inaccessibility (or"
320,SECTION III.,"otherwise) of the gates, the defence of Lankā, and the dwellings of the"
321,SECTION III.,"Rākshasas. Do thou faithfully relate this unto me, for thou art"
322,SECTION III.,"observant"". Hearing Rāma’s speech, Hanumān, offspring of the Wind-god,"
323,SECTION III.,"foremost of those conversant with speech, again spake unto"
324,SECTION III.,"Rāma,—""Hearken! I will describe unto thee by what method is the city of"
325,SECTION III.,"Lankā guarded and protected by the Rākshasas, how loyal the Rākshasas"
326,SECTION III.,"are, the surpassing prosperity of Lankā, the dreadfulness of the deep,"
327,SECTION III.,"the divisions of the forces, and the number of the elephants, horses,"
328,SECTION III.,"cars, etc"". Having said this, that best of monkeys, knowing the nature"
329,SECTION III.,"of things, went on,—""Lankā, filled with mad elephants, ever rejoiceth."
330,SECTION III.,"She is great, thronging with cars and inhabited by Rākshasas. Her doors"
331,SECTION III.,are firmly established and furnished with massy bolts. And she hath four
332,SECTION III.,"wide and giant gates. (At those gates) are powerful and large arms,"
333,SECTION III.,"stones, and engines, whereby a hostile host approaching, is opposed. At"
334,SECTION III.,"the entrances are arrayed and set in order by bands of heroic Rākshasas,"
335,SECTION III.,hundreds of dreadful sharp iron _sataghnis_.⁶ She hath a mighty
336,SECTION III.,"impassable golden wall, having its side emblazoned in the centre with"
337,SECTION III.,"costly stones, coral, lapises and pearls. Round about is a moat,"
338,SECTION III.,"exceedingly dreadful, with cool water, eminently grand, fathomless,"
339,SECTION III.,"containing ferocious aquatic animals, and inhabited by fishes. At the"
340,SECTION III.,"gates are four broad bridges, furnished with machines and many rows of"
341,SECTION III.,"grand structures. On the approach of hostile forces, their attack is"
342,SECTION III.,"repulsed by these machines, and they are thrown into the ditch. One"
343,SECTION III.,"among these bridges is immovable, strong and fast established; adorned"
344,SECTION III.,"with golden pillars and daises. O Rāma, albeit Rāvana hungereth for"
345,SECTION III.,"fight, yet is he calm; and he is vigilant and ever engaged in"
346,SECTION III.,superintending his army. And dreadful and resembling a celestial
347,SECTION III.,"citadel, Lankā cannot be ascended by means of any support. She hath"
348,SECTION III.,"fortresses composed of streams, those of hills, and artificial ones of"
349,SECTION III.,"four kinds. And, O Rāghava, she is situated on the other shore of the"
350,SECTION III.,ocean having its limit far away. And way there is none even for
351,SECTION III.,"barks,—and all sides are destitute of division. And that citadel is"
352,SECTION III.,"built on the mountain’s brow; and, resembling the metropolis of the"

361,SECTION III.,protect the Northern gate. And car-warriors and horsemen—persons honored
362,SECTION III.,"and sprung from noble lines—by hundreds and thousands,—and irrepressible"
363,SECTION III.,"goblins and _kotis_ of Rākshasas, protect the garrison. I have broken"

383,SECTION IV.,"Hearing Hanumān’s speech duly from the beginning, the exceedingly"
384,SECTION IV.,"energetic Rāma having truth for his prowess, said,—""What thou sayest—’I"
385,SECTION IV.,"shall speedily destroy the city of this dreadful Raksha,’—is true, I"
386,SECTION IV.,"tell thee. Therefore, at this very moment arrange for Sugriva’s march."
387,SECTION IV.,"The Sun hath attained his meridian at this proper moment, capable of"
388,SECTION IV.,conferring victory.⁸ Let Rāvana carry away Sitā (to his own

390,SECTION IV.,"hath taken a death-dispelling drug and drunk ambrosia, Sitā, hearing of"
391,SECTION IV.,"my preparations for war, shall inspire hope of life. To-day the Northern"

398,SECTION IV.,"import of things, again said,—""Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of"
399,SECTION IV.,"fast-speeding monkeys, let Nila go ahead of this force, for surveying"
400,SECTION IV.,"the route. O Nila, do thou, O general, expeditiously take the army by a"
401,SECTION IV.,"path furnished with fruits and roots, having cool waters of the woods,"
402,SECTION IV.,"and replenished with honey. The wicked Rākshasas vitiate¹⁰ fruits, roots"
403,SECTION IV.,"and water along the way. Thou, ever on the alert, shouldst preserve"
404,SECTION IV.,"these from the Rakshas. And, bounding down into hollow places,"
405,SECTION IV.,"mountain-fastnesses, and woods, let the rangers of the wilds, spy the"
406,SECTION IV.,"posted detachments of the enemy. Let those that are incompetent, stay"
407,SECTION IV.,"here. This business is dreadful, and we should apply our best strength"
408,SECTION IV.,in conducting the same. Therefore let the foremost monkeys gifted with
409,SECTION IV.,"prodigious prowess lead forth the choice portion of the army, numbering"
410,SECTION IV.,"hundreds and thousands. And let Gaja resembling a hill, and the"
411,SECTION IV.,"exceedingly powerful Gavaya, and that monkey, Gavaksha, master of the"
412,SECTION IV.,"leaping ones,¹¹ like a haughty bull among kine, go in the van of the"
413,SECTION IV.,"monkey-host. And let that foremost of monkeys, Rishava, go, protecting"
414,SECTION IV.,"the right wing (of the army); and let Gandha, irrisistible like an"
415,SECTION IV.,"elephant with the fragrant temporal juice trickling down, and the"

419,SECTION IV.,"And like the lord of wealth and master of riches, mounted on"

423,SECTION IV.,"Hearing Rāghava’s words, that foremost of monkeys and lord of the army,"
424,SECTION IV.,"the exceedingly energetic Sugriva, issued his orders. And anon those"
425,SECTION IV.,"highly powerful monkeys issuing up from caves and mountain-summits,"
426,SECTION IV.,"began to bound (on all sides). Thereafter, honored by the king of"
427,SECTION IV.,"monkeys and also Lakshmana, the righteous Rāma, accompanied by his"
428,SECTION IV.,"forces, set out in a southerly direction. And he marched, surrounded by"
429,SECTION IV.,"hundreds and thousands, Kotis and Ayutas of monkeys resembling"
430,SECTION IV.,elephants. And he marching was followed by the mighty host of monkeys;
431,SECTION IV.,and all those maintained by Sugriva were filled with joy and betrayed
432,SECTION IV.,demonstrations of delight. And bounding by way of guarding the flanks of
433,SECTION IV.,"the forces, and leaping in front of the army for pioneering, blustering,"
434,SECTION IV.,"emitting leonine roars, and uttering cries, the monkeys made towards the"
435,SECTION IV.,"south. And some partook of perfumed honey and fruits, and some bore"
436,SECTION IV.,"mighty trees, holding the sprouts. And some in pride (of strength)"
437,SECTION IV.,suddenly raised others and threw them down. And some fell and were anon
438,SECTION IV.,"up, and some brought others down. ’We shall slay Rāvana, as also all the"
439,SECTION IV.,rangers of the night’; thus did the monkeys roar out in the presence of
440,SECTION IV.,"Rāghava. Before (the army), Rhrishabha, the heroic Nila, and Kumuda,"
441,SECTION IV.,"along with many monkeys, went on clearing the route. In the middle were"
442,SECTION IV.,"king Sugriva, Rāma and Lakshamana, environed by innumerable powerful and"
443,SECTION IV.,"terrible monkeys. And the heroic monkey, Satavali, surrounded by ten"
444,SECTION IV.,"Kotis (of troops), alone on all sides protected that monkey host. And"
445,SECTION IV.,"accompanied by an hundred Kotis, Kesari, Panasa, Gaja¹³ and Arka, by"
446,SECTION IV.,means of many protected that host on every side. And taking Sugriva
447,SECTION IV.,"before them, Sushena, and Jāmbavān, surrounded by innumerable bears,"
448,SECTION IV.,protected the rear (of the army.) And that foremost of rangers possessed
449,SECTION IV.,"of excellence, and of restrained senses, the heroic Nila, general (of"
450,SECTION IV.,"the army), kept going round the ranks. And Vālimukha, and Prajangha,"
451,SECTION IV.,"Jambha and the monkey Rabhasa, went everywhere, urging on the monkeys."
452,SECTION IV.,"While thus marching, breathing pride of strength, those tiger-like"
453,SECTION IV.,monkeys saw that foremost of mountains _Sahya_ crowned with hundreds of
454,SECTION IV.,"trees, and watery expanses laughing with flowers, and beautiful tanks."
455,SECTION IV.,"And knowing the order of Rāma of dreadful wrath, that terrible and"
456,SECTION IV.,"mighty host, exceedingly terrific and resembling the bosom of the deep,"
457,SECTION IV.,"cowed down through fear, leaving behind cities and villages and"
458,SECTION IV.,"provinces, went like the deep-sounding sea. And at the side of"
459,SECTION IV.,"Daçaratha’s son those heroic monkeys resembling elephants, proceeded by"
460,SECTION IV.,"bounds, like noble horses, spurred on. And those foremost of men,"
461,SECTION IV.,"mounted on the monkeys, looked beautiful like the Sun and the Moon half"
462,SECTION IV.,"eclipsed by the two mighty planets, _viz_., Rāhu and Ketu. And (thus)"
463,SECTION IV.,"did the righteous Rāma proceed towards the South, accompanied by his"
464,SECTION IV.,"army. Then Lakshmana, furnished with consummate sense and promptitude,"
465,SECTION IV.,"who was mounted on Angada, spoke unto Rāma, inviting words, fraught with"
466,SECTION IV.,"import. ""Speedily recovering Vaidehi, who hath been carried away, and"
467,SECTION IV.,"slaying Rāvana, thou wilt, thy end attained, return to Ayodhyā, who"
468,SECTION IV.,"shall also have her desire. O Rāghava, I see all the great auspicious"
469,SECTION IV.,"omens on earth and in the sky, signifying success unto thee. Mildly and"
470,SECTION IV.,"grateful doth the blessed breeze blow behind the army, inspiring"
471,SECTION IV.,pleasure. And the birds and beasts are crying in sonorous voices. And
472,SECTION IV.,all the points (of the compass) appear pleasant; and the lord of day is
473,SECTION IV.,"cloudless. Bhrigu’s son, Uçanas, also weareth for thee an auspicious"
474,SECTION IV.,"aspect, and Dhruva is without blemish. And all the _rishis_, pure and"
475,SECTION IV.,"furnished with lustre, go round Dhruva. And before us shineth the"
476,SECTION IV.,grandfather of the high-souled Ikshwākus; the spotless Rājarshi
477,SECTION IV.,"Triçanku, with his priest.—And stainless and free from disturbances"
478,SECTION IV.,"appeareth Visākhā. This is the racial star of us, the high-souled"
479,SECTION IV.,"Ikshwākus. And Nairita, the racial star of the Nairitas, is sore"
480,SECTION IV.,"afflicted and, touched by the rod-bearing Dhumketu is in trouble. All"
481,SECTION IV.,"this is for the destruction of the Rākshasas. At the fated time, those"
482,SECTION IV.,"that are in the clutches of Death, have their stars afflicted by the"
483,SECTION IV.,planets. And the water is dear and tastes sweet; and the woods are
484,SECTION IV.,stocked with fruit. And the odorous gale doth not blow strongly; and the
485,SECTION IV.,"trees are furnished with all blossoms of of the season. And, O lord,"
486,SECTION IV.,"this host of monkeys appeareth splendid to the height, as did the"
487,SECTION IV.,celestial host on the occasion of the destruction of Tāraka. Seeing all
488,SECTION IV.,"this, thou shouldst, O noble one, feel delighted"". Having thus consoled"
489,SECTION IV.,"his brother, Sumitrā’s son, feeling enlivened, said this. The"
490,SECTION IV.,"monkey-host went on, covering the earth. And the mighty dust raised by"
491,SECTION IV.,"bears, monkeys, and tigers, having for their weapons nails and"
492,SECTION IV.,"teeth,—with the foreparts of their feet and hands, enveloped the world,"
493,SECTION IV.,and the splendour of the sun was obscured. And as clouds envelope the
494,SECTION IV.,"sky, the mighty monkey-host went on, covering up the Southern quarter"
495,SECTION IV.,"with its mountains, woods, and sky. And as they marched covering many a"
496,SECTION IV.,"_yojana_, the streams seemed as if they flowed in an opposite"
497,SECTION IV.,"direction.¹⁴ And they, while proceeding, took rest by pools of clear"
498,SECTION IV.,"water, on mountains covered with trees, on plains and in forests teeming"
499,SECTION IV.,"with fruits. Some moving straight, some moving askance, and some moving"
500,SECTION IV.,"on the earth, that enormous monkey-host went on covering the entire"
501,SECTION IV.,earth. And they were all of delighted countenances and gifted with the
502,SECTION IV.,velocity of the wind. And these monkeys devoted all their energy to the
503,SECTION IV.,accomplishment of Rāghava’s work. And they were displaying unto each
504,SECTION IV.,"other their joy, prowess and energy. And influenced with the vanity of"
505,SECTION IV.,"youth they set up diverse cries. Some proceeded with speed, some leaped,"
506,SECTION IV.,"some set up cries expressing joy, some were uplifting their tails, and"
507,SECTION IV.,"some were striking the ground with their feet. Some, stretching forth"
508,SECTION IV.,"their arms, were breaking the hills, and others the trees. And others"
509,SECTION IV.,were ascending the tops of the hills. Some began to make terrible
510,SECTION IV.,"sounds, and others made a tingling noise. And many others blasted the"
511,SECTION IV.,creepers with the velocity of their thighs. And some were engaged in
512,SECTION IV.,sporting with trees and rocks. And thus was the earth enveloped with
513,SECTION IV.,millions and _kotis_ of fearful monkeys. And thus the enormous monkey
514,SECTION IV.,"host went on day and night. And all those monkeys, delighted, guided by"
515,SECTION IV.,"Sugriva, and taking delight in battle, went on speedily. And they did"
516,SECTION IV.,"not take rest even for a moment, desirous of rescuing Sitā. Thereupon,"
517,SECTION IV.,"getting at the mount _Sahya_ covered with various trees and forests,"
518,SECTION IV.,those monkeys ascended it. And Rāma went on beholding the variegated
519,SECTION IV.,"forest, rivers and fountains of the mount _Sahya_ and _Malaya_. And"
520,SECTION IV.,"those monkeys broke down various trees—_Champakas_, _Tilakās, mangos,"
521,SECTION IV.,"*Prasekas_, _Sindubarakas_, _Tiniças_ and _Karaviras_, _Asokas_,"
522,SECTION IV.,"_Karanjas_, _Plakshas_, _Nyagrodhas_, _Jambukas_ and _Amalakas_. And"
523,SECTION IV.,"seated on picturesque rocks, various forest trees, shaken by the wind,"
524,SECTION IV.,showered flowers on them. And there blew in those forests filled with
525,SECTION IV.,"the smell of honey, a wind of pleasant touch, cool as the Moon,"
526,SECTION IV.,accompanied by the hummings of the bees. And that mount was richly
527,SECTION IV.,embellished with diverse metals. And dust issuing from these metals and
528,SECTION IV.,"thickened by the air, enveloped on all sides the huge monkey-host. There"
529,SECTION IV.,"blossomed in that picturesque mountain-vale _Ketakas_, _Sindubaras_,"
530,SECTION IV.,"beautiful _Vasantees_, _Mādhabis_, _Gandhapurnas_, _Kandas_,"
531,SECTION IV.,"_Chiravilyas_, _Mahikas_, _Vanjulas_, _Vakulas_, _Ranjakas_, _Tilakās_,"
532,SECTION IV.,"_Nagas_, _Chutas_, _Patalikas_, _Kobidaras_, _Muchlindas_, _Arjunas_,"
533,SECTION IV.,"_Singsapas_, _Kutajas_, _Pintalas_, _Tiniças_, _Churnkas_, _Neepakas_,"
534,SECTION IV.,"_Neela-Sokas_, _Saralas_, _Ankolas_ and lotuses. And all these trees"
535,SECTION IV.,"were greatly disturbed by those monkeys, delighted with their view."
536,SECTION IV.,There were in that mountain many a picturesque lake and pond filled with
537,SECTION IV.,"_Chakravakas_ and _Karandavas_, ducks, _Chraunchas_ and the mount"
538,SECTION IV.,"abounded on all sides with boars, deer, and terrible bears, lions and"
539,SECTION IV.,"tigers and various other fearful animals, and it was beautified with"
540,SECTION IV.,"full blown lotuses, lilies, _Utpalas_ and various other fragrant trees"
541,SECTION IV.,growing in the water. And various birds set up their musical choir on
542,SECTION IV.,"the summit of that mount. And bathing and drinking, these monkeys"
543,SECTION IV.,sported in the water. And ascending the mount these monkeys continually
544,SECTION IV.,"bounded. And excited with drink, they crumbled into pieces the"
545,SECTION IV.,"ambrosia-smelling fruits, roots and flowers of the trees. And those"
546,SECTION IV.,"monkeys yellow as honey, delighted, feasted on mangoes, long and"
547,SECTION IV.,"measuring a _drona_. Breaking down the trees, blasting the creepers,"
548,SECTION IV.,"bounding from one tree to another and making the mount _Sahya_ echo,"
549,SECTION IV.,those leading monkeys went on delighted and excited with drink. Some
550,SECTION IV.,"ascending the trees, and others drinking, the whole earth was enveloped"
551,SECTION IV.,"with those monkeys, and seemed as if beautified with ripe paddy crops."
552,SECTION IV.,"And reaching the mount Mahendra, the large-armed Rāma, having eyes like"
553,SECTION IV.,"lotuses, ascended the summit adorned with diverse trees. And getting at"
554,SECTION IV.,"the top, Daçaratha’s son espied the vast deep filled with tortoises and"
555,SECTION IV.,"fishes. Thereupon, passing by the mounts _Sahya_ and _Malaya_ and"
556,SECTION IV.,"arranging their enormous host, they¹⁵ by and by reached the roaring"
557,SECTION IV.,"deep. And descending therefrom, Rāma, the foremost of those who minister"
558,SECTION IV.,"happiness unto all, accompanied by Lakshmana and Sugriva, entered the"
559,SECTION IV.,forest situate on the banks of the ocean. And reaching the expansive
560,SECTION IV.,"banks having rocks thereon and continually washed by the rising billows,"
561,SECTION IV.,"Rāma spoke saying,—""O Sugriva we have arrived at the abode of Varuna."
562,SECTION IV.,Now hath arisen in my mind what I had not thought of before. And this
563,SECTION IV.,"ocean, the lord of the streams, whose other side is not seen, cannot be"
564,SECTION IV.,crossed over without some excellent measure. Let the monkey-host be
565,SECTION IV.,"encamped here therefore, and then concert a plan by means of which they"
566,SECTION IV.,"might get at the other side. And reaching the shores of the ocean, the"
567,SECTION IV.,"large-armed Rāma, stricken with grief for Sitā, ordered their"
568,SECTION IV.,"encampment, saying,—""O foremost of monkeys, do thou encamp thy host on"
569,SECTION IV.,"the brink of the ocean. Now hath arrived the hour for counsel, when we"
570,SECTION IV.,should devise some plan for crossing over the main. I fear the Rākshasas
571,SECTION IV.,"at every step, for they are greatly illusion creating—let the leaders"
572,SECTION IV.,"therefore go to their own hosts and let them not proceed anywhere else,"
573,SECTION IV.,"renouncing them"". Hearing the words of Rāma, Sugriva along with"
574,SECTION IV.,"Lakshmana, encamped the army on the brink of the ocean covered with"
575,SECTION IV.,"trees. And stationed near the main, the monkey-host in consequence of"
576,SECTION IV.,"their resemblance in colour with the blue contents of the deep, looked"
577,SECTION IV.,"like a second ocean. Thereupon, reaching the shore, those leading"
578,SECTION IV.,monkeys engaged in concerting a plan to cross over the vasty deep. And
579,SECTION IV.,"the tumult, of that monkey-host encamped there, was heard above the"
580,SECTION IV.,roaring of the deep. And that huge army of the monkeys commanded by
581,SECTION IV.,"Sugriva, and set up in three divisions, were deeply concerned with the"
582,SECTION IV.,"accomplishment of Rāma’s work. And reaching the shore of the vasty deep,"
583,SECTION IV.,"that monkey host, delighted, beheld the ocean moved by the Wind. And"
584,SECTION IV.,"they waited there beholding the deep of unimpeded expanse, having its"
585,SECTION IV.,"distant shore inhabited by the demons, and thronged with various aquatic"
586,SECTION IV.,"animals. While upheaving its foam on the approach of eve, it appeared"
587,SECTION IV.,"laughing and setting up its surges, it appeared to dance. It increased"
588,SECTION IV.,with the rising of the Moon and he reflected himself on its breast. That
589,SECTION IV.,"abode of Varuna was infested with gigantic sharks, whales and"
590,SECTION IV.,"_Timingalas_¹⁶, disturbed with the fury of the Wind, filled with"
591,SECTION IV.,"serpents having flaming frames, and various aquatic animals and rocks"
592,SECTION IV.,and was fathomless deep. It had picturesque fortresses on its marge and
593,SECTION IV.,its other shore was hard to get at. And the _Makaras_¹⁷ and serpents
594,SECTION IV.,"living therein were moved by the Wind. The waters, as if delighted, were"
595,SECTION IV.,"rising and falling. And having serpents of flaming frames underneath, it"
596,SECTION IV.,appeared as if sprinkled with scintillations of fire. And that terrible
597,SECTION IV.,abode of the demons extended down to the regions inhabited by the
598,SECTION IV.,_Nagas_ or serpents. The deep resembled the welkin and the welkin the
599,SECTION IV.,"deep, and there appeared no difference between them. The sky crested"
600,SECTION IV.,with stars and the deep filled with gems resembled each other. The sky
601,SECTION IV.,enveloped with clouds and the ocean overflowing with surges presented no
602,SECTION IV.,contrast whatsoever. The waves of the mighty deep beating at each other
603,SECTION IV.,"continually, set up a sound resembling that of a trumpet in the sky. It"
604,SECTION IV.,was filled with diverse gems and its water was poisoned by means of the
605,SECTION IV.,"air. It was filled with various aquatic animals, and upheaving its"
606,SECTION IV.,"billows, it appeared as if excited with ire. And there beheld those"
607,SECTION IV.,high-souled monkeys the mighty main agitated by the Wind and muttering
608,SECTION IV.,"as if with the upheaval of the waves. Thereupon, overwhelmed with"
609,SECTION IV.,"surprise, those monkeys, stationed there, espied the main brimming with"
610,SECTION IV.,rolling waters and moving as if (off its place).

655,SECTION V.,"being encamped on the shore of the lord of streams and rivers, Rāma,"
656,SECTION V.,"beholding Lakshmana by his side, spoke, saying—""I know that grief abates"
657,SECTION V.,"as time passes by, but my sorrow arising from the separation of my"
658,SECTION V.,"spouse, is increasing day by day. I am not sorry that she hath been"
659,SECTION V.,stealthily taken away by the demon—but my sorrow is that her end is
660,SECTION V.,"drawing nigh. O Wind, do thou go there where my dear spouse is, and"

662,SECTION V.,stationing my looks in the Moon and being touched by thee. Alas! my dear

665,SECTION V.,"by the fire of desire, having separation from her for its fuel and her"
666,SECTION V.,"thoughts for its flame. Leaving thee, O Son of Sumitrā, I shall jump"
667,SECTION V.,into the deep and then shall not this fire burn me any more. This is my
668,SECTION V.,"only consolation, for which I draw my vital breath—that myself and she"
669,SECTION V.,breathe on the same earth. Like unto a dry land drawing water from a
670,SECTION V.,"watered ground, I do live, hearing that Jānaki still survives. When"
671,SECTION V.,"shall I, discomfitting my enemies, behold Sitā, having a beautiful waist"

708,SECTION VI.,on this occasion? It behoveth you all to give me such counsel as
709,SECTION VI.,"becometh me and will conduce to my glory"". ’Victory is the outcome of"
710,SECTION VI.,"consultation’—this do the sages¹⁸ say. Let us, therefore, O mighty ones,"
711,SECTION VI.,"engage in counsel, relating to the measures we should adopt towards"
712,SECTION VI.,Rāma. There are three orders of men on this earth—the superior the
713,SECTION VI.,middling and the inferior. This distinction cannot be perceived without
714,SECTION VI.,"a knowledge of the signs, and so I shall relate unto you their merits"
715,SECTION VI.,"and demerits. He is said to belong to the superior order, whose counsel"
716,SECTION VI.,"contains the three signs (mentioned below), or who engages in works"
717,SECTION VI.,after consulting duly with friends capable or with persons having the
718,SECTION VI.,"same end in view, and some times with others, and who serveth"
719,SECTION VI.,Providence. He belongs to the middle order who consults his own self
720,SECTION VI.,"only, depends on the Providence, and engages alone in works. And he"
721,SECTION VI.,belongs to the inferior order who engageth in works without ascertaining
722,SECTION VI.,"their merits or demerits, disregarding the will of the Providence and"
723,SECTION VI.,"saying, ’I will do this’, and is inactive (at last). And counsels are"
724,SECTION VI.,also divided into three divisions like unto the three orders of men
725,SECTION VI.,(mentioned). That counsel belongs to the superior order in which the
726,SECTION VI.,counsellors with their judgment reinforced by a knowledge of political
727,SECTION VI.,"ethics, are unanimous. That one belongs to the middle order in which the"
728,SECTION VI.,"counsellors after varied discussion, arrive at unanimity in the long"
729,SECTION VI.,run. And that one is the worst in which the counsellors differ from each
730,SECTION VI.,"other and agree a little in the long run, with no good result. You are"
731,SECTION VI.,all gifted with good intellects: do you all unanimously settle as to
732,SECTION VI.,what becometh me and conduceth to my well-being. Environed by a thousand
733,SECTION VI.,"of patient monkeys, Rāma, with a view to capture our city, is"
734,SECTION VI.,"approaching towards Lankā. Forsooth, shall he cross over the main along"
735,SECTION VI.,with his younger brother and a mighty host. He can by his prowess dry up
736,SECTION VI.,the ocean and do the other.¹⁹ Rāma approaching thus with a hostile

753,SECTION VII.,"the serpents in battle. The God of Death, living on mount Kailāça,"

758,SECTION VII.,"lord of Rākshasas, desiring thy friendship out of fear, Maya, the king"

764,SECTION VII.,"heroic Dānavas, the _Kalakeyas_, were greatly powerful, irrepressible,"

767,SECTION VII.,"O slayer of foes, and learn from them the science of varied illusions, O"
768,SECTION VII.,"king of the Rākshasas. O great hero, by thee were defeated in battle,"
769,SECTION VII.,"the heroic and powerful sons of Varuna, followed by a fourfold division"

772,SECTION VII.,"the noose for the billows, his attendants for the serpents and his"
773,SECTION VII.,terrible fever for the dreadful attitude of the deep. And diving into
774,SECTION VII.,"this terrible deep, thou didst, O king, discomfit Death himself and win"
775,SECTION VII.,glorious victory. And every one was pleased there with thy successful
776,SECTION VII.,"fight. The Earth was filled with various heroic Kshetriyas, resembling"
777,SECTION VII.,Sakra in prowess as she is adorned now with various trees. Rāghava is
778,SECTION VII.,"not their equal either in strength or prowess. And all those heroes,"

1014,SECTION XI.,"The unrighteous king, overmastered by his passion (for Sitā), in"
1015,SECTION XI.,consequence of his sinful act as well as the loss of honor he sustained
1016,SECTION XI.,"at the hands of his friends, became reduced. And the occasion for war"
1017,SECTION XI.,"was wanting. Rāvana, possessed by lust, and continually thinking of"
1018,SECTION XI.,"Vaidehi, conceived along with his counsellors that the time for entering"
1019,SECTION XI.,"into hostilities had arrived. And sallying forth, he ascended a mighty"
1020,SECTION XI.,"car furnished with golden network, adorned with pearls and coral, and"
1021,SECTION XI.,"yoked with trained steeds. And having ascended that excellent vehicle,"
1022,SECTION XI.,"having sounds resembling those of mighty clouds, that foremost of"
1023,SECTION XI.,"Rakshas, the Ten necked one, drove towards the court. And as he coursed"
1024,SECTION XI.,"on, Rākshasas, bearing swords and shields, and carrying all kinds of"
1025,SECTION XI.,"weapons, went before the lord of the Rākshasas. And (some of) these,"
1026,SECTION XI.,"wearing various frightful suits, and decked with diverse ornaments,"
1027,SECTION XI.,"went, surrounding his rear and flanks. And _atirathas_ went with cars,"
1028,SECTION XI.,"and superb mad elephants, and sportive steeds; and bearing in their"
1029,SECTION XI.,hands maces and bludgeons; and darts and clubs. And as Rāvana marched
1030,SECTION XI.,"towards the court, there arose the loud blares of thousand trumpet, and"
1031,SECTION XI.,the uproarious sounds of conches. And that redoubtable and mighty
1032,SECTION XI.,"car-warrior held his course, suddenly making sides resound, and"
1033,SECTION XI.,beautifying the highways. And the spotless white umbrella of the lord of
1034,SECTION XI.,"Rākshasas, being raised up, looked beautiful like the Moon at her full."
1035,SECTION XI.,On his right and left graced two crystal white chowris furnished with
1036,SECTION XI.,threads of gold. And all the Rākshasas standing on the ground with
1037,SECTION XI.,"joined hands, bow down their heads to the foremost of Rākshasas who was"
1038,SECTION XI.,"seated on his car. Hymned by the Rākshasas with blessings for victory,"
1039,SECTION XI.,that exceedingly energetic chastiser of enemies arrived at the court
1040,SECTION XI.,constructed (by Viçwakarmā). And that highly energetic one in person
1041,SECTION XI.,"entered that court paved with silver and gold, having its heart"
1042,SECTION XI.,"decorated with crystal, and gracefully covered with silk, embroidered"
1043,SECTION XI.,"with gold; excellently constructed by Viçwakarmā, and guarded by six"
1044,SECTION XI.,hundred ghosts. And Rāvana sat down on a superior and august seat
1045,SECTION XI.,"consisting of lapises, furnished with a pillow; and covered with a soft"
1046,SECTION XI.,"dear-skin. And lord-like, he commanded the envoys possessed of fleet"
1047,SECTION XI.,"vigor, saying, ""Do ye speedily summon hither the Rākshasas. I fan some"
1048,SECTION XI.,"mighty effort hath to be put forth against our foes. Hearing his words,"
1049,SECTION XI.,"the envoys began to range Lankā; and going to every house, they"
1050,SECTION XI.,"fearlessly collected the Rākshas from places of sport, bed-rooms, and"
1051,SECTION XI.,"gardens. Then some set out, mounting cars, and some mounting proud"
1052,SECTION XI.,"coursers, and some on foot. And like the welkin filled with fowls, the"
1053,SECTION XI.,"city thronged with approaching cars, elephants and steeds. And leaving"
1054,SECTION XI.,"their various vehicles and cars behind, they entered the court on foot,"
1055,SECTION XI.,like lions entering mountain caverns. And taking the feet of the
1056,SECTION XI.,"sovereign, and honored by him (in turn), they sat them down, some on"
1057,SECTION XI.,"raised seats, some on cushions of Kuça, and some on the floor. And"
1058,SECTION XI.,"presenting themselves agreeably to the command of the monarch, they sat"
1059,SECTION XI.,"them down each according to his position, before the lord of Rākshasas,"
1060,SECTION XI.,Rāvana. And there came also the learned and competent to arrive at
1061,SECTION XI.,"infallible decisions, and they sat them down in order of merit. And"
1062,SECTION XI.,"there also came courtiers endowed with virtues, versed in every thing,"
1063,SECTION XI.,"and having intelligence for their eye-sight,—and innumerable heroes by"
1064,SECTION XI.,hundreds also (arrived) at that court for ascertaining the course that
1065,SECTION XI.,"would prove beneficial. And then mounting a large, noble and splendid"
1066,SECTION XI.,"car, having its parts decked with gold, and yoked with horses, the"
1067,SECTION XI.,magnanimous and renowned Vibhishana went to the court of his elder
1068,SECTION XI.,"brother. And that younger brother (of Rāvana), announcing his name,"
1069,SECTION XI.,bowed down at the feet of his elder brother. And Suka and Prahasta were
1070,SECTION XI.,employed in giving to each a separate seat befitting his rank. And from
1071,SECTION XI.,all sides in the court there began to spread the odour of excellent
1072,SECTION XI.,"_agura_ and sandal and wreaths belonging to the Rākshasas, decked in"
1073,SECTION XI.,"gold and various gems, and clad in costly attires. And no one among"
1074,SECTION XI.,"these present at court uttered any thing, or spoke any falsehood, or"
1075,SECTION XI.,"conversed in loud accents. And having completely attained their desire,"
1076,SECTION XI.,"all of fierce prowess, gazed at the face of their lord. And in the"
1077,SECTION XI.,"assembly of those intelligent, and exceedingly powerful persons,"
1078,SECTION XI.,"equipped with arms, the intelligent Rāvana appeared splendid like the"
1079,SECTION XI.,Vajra-handed Indra among the Vasus.

1086,SECTION XII.,"Then surveying that entire assembly, that conqueror in battle delivered"
1087,SECTION XII.,"himself unto Prahasta,—general of the forces, saying,—""O general, it"
1088,SECTION XII.,behoveth thee so to order disciplined fourfold forces that they may
1089,SECTION XII.,"successfully protect the city"". Thereat, Prahasta, carefully carrying"
1090,SECTION XII.,"out the royal behest, stationed all the forces within and without the"
1091,SECTION XII.,"city. And having posted the army for the defence of the city, Prahasta"
1092,SECTION XII.,"sitting down before the king, said,—""I have stationed the forces"
1093,SECTION XII.,"belonging to thee who art possessed of strength, inside as well as"
1094,SECTION XII.,"outside. (Now), without suffering thy mind to be agitated with anxiety,"
1095,SECTION XII.,"speedily, do what is in thy heart. Hearing the speech of Prahasta"
1096,SECTION XII.,"seeking the welfare of the kingdom, Rāvana craving for enjoyment spoke"
1097,SECTION XII.,"in the midst of his aderents,—""When virtue, or happiness, or interest is"
1098,SECTION XII.,"in straits, it behoveth you to (know your course) in relation to"
1099,SECTION XII.,"pleasant and unpleasant, happiness and misery, profitable and"
1100,SECTION XII.,"unprofitable, and good and evil. No business of mine which ye have set"
1101,SECTION XII.,"about after taking counsel, hath ever miscarried. And like Vāsava"
1102,SECTION XII.,"environed by the moon, stars and planets, and the Maruts, I surrounded"
1103,SECTION XII.,"by you, have attained to plenitude of prosperity. I am, for certain,"
1104,SECTION XII.,"going to employ you all. In consequence of sleep, I could not inform him"
1105,SECTION XII.,of this matter. After having slept for six months that one of prodigious
1106,SECTION XII.,strength—foremost of those bearing arms—hath just risen. Janaka’s
1107,SECTION XII.,daughter and Rāma’s beloved wife hath been brought hither from the
1108,SECTION XII.,"forest of Dandaka, the region ranged by Rakshas. That indolent damsel"
1109,SECTION XII.,"wisheth not to ascend my bed; nor is there any in the three spheres,"
1110,SECTION XII.,"that to me is like unto Sitā. She is slender waisted, and high-hipped,"
1111,SECTION XII.,and her face is as the autumnal Moon resembling a golden image. She is
1112,SECTION XII.,meek and looketh like the hand work of Maya himself gifted with an
1113,SECTION XII.,infinite variety of fascinations.³⁴ And beholding her dainty and tender
1114,SECTION XII.,"feet with roseate soles, and having coppery nails, my mind burneth (with"
1115,SECTION XII.,desire). And seeing her resembling the flame of a sacrificial fire and
1116,SECTION XII.,the splendour of the Sun himself; and her fair face furnished with a
1117,SECTION XII.,"prominent nose and elegant eyes, I, having lost control over self, have"
1118,SECTION XII.,"come under the sway of desire. And my passion, uninfluenced by anger and"
1119,SECTION XII.,"joy, capable of producing pallor, and constantly causing anguish and"
1120,SECTION XII.,"sorrow, hath rendered me pale. Expecting her lord, Rāma, the beautiful"
1121,SECTION XII.,"one having expansive eyes, hath solicited for a year’s space; and I have"
1122,SECTION XII.,pledged my fair woods to her of graceful eyes. But tired am I on account
1123,SECTION XII.,"of my passion,—like a horse spent on the way. How can the rangers of the"
1124,SECTION XII.,"woods, or the sons of Daçaratha cross over the sea ungovernable and"
1125,SECTION XII.,"swarming with countless creatures and fishes? On the other hand, a"
1126,SECTION XII.,single month hath troubled us grievously. Hard it is therefore to
1127,SECTION XII.,"understand the course of events. Do ye act, each as he thinks proper."
1128,SECTION XII.,"And although no fear can come from mortals, yet ye should deliberate (as"
1129,SECTION XII.,to what ye should do). Formerly I had gained victory with the help given
1130,SECTION XII.,"by you; do ye in the same way stand by me now. The king’s son, having"
1131,SECTION XII.,"learnt that Sitā is on the other shore of the ocean, taking before them"
1132,SECTION XII.,"monkeys headed by Sugriva, reached Varuna’s abode. Do ye so counsel that"
1133,SECTION XII.,Sitā may be with-holden by me and the sons of Daçaratha may be slain;
1134,SECTION XII.,but ye must prefer certain counsel. No other³⁵ person in this world hath
1135,SECTION XII.,"the power to cross the sea along with the monkeys,—victory, therefore,"
1136,SECTION XII.,"is undubitably mine"". Hearing the sorrowful speech of (Rāvana) afflicted"
1137,SECTION XII.,"with lust, Kumbhakarna greatly enraged, and said,—""When just on seeing"
1138,SECTION XII.,"(Sitā) of Rāma along with Lakshmana, thou didst by main force carry her"
1139,SECTION XII.,"away, it plainly appeareth that thy mind, like the Yamuna filling her"
1140,SECTION XII.,"bed, hath been possessed (by her).³⁶ O great king, all this (that thou"
1141,SECTION XII.,hast done) is not worthy of thee. If thou hadst at the outset consulted
1142,SECTION XII.,"us in this matter, we would have done what was proper.³⁷ O ten-faced"
1143,SECTION XII.,"one, the king that arriving at certain conclusions, carrieth on his"
1144,SECTION XII.,"regal affairs agreeably to justice, hath not to repent afterwards. But"
1145,SECTION XII.,"those actions that are done without deliberation, like unto clarified"
1146,SECTION XII.,"butter poured in an impure sacrifice, conduces only to harm. He doth not"
1147,SECTION XII.,"know what is proper and what not, that performs prior actions"
1148,SECTION XII.,"afterwards, and posterior actions first. Others spy holes in the actions"
1149,SECTION XII.,"of the volatile; the latter may be possessed of great power,—like swans"
1150,SECTION XII.,passing Krauncha through the hole.³⁸ By luck it is that Rāma hath not
1151,SECTION XII.,"yet slain thee, who hath done this tremendous thing, without reflection,"
1152,SECTION XII.,resembling food mixed with poison. But as thou hast entered upon a
1153,SECTION XII.,"course of action which is improper even in respect of foes, I will, O"
1154,SECTION XII.,"sinless one, perform thy work by slaying thy enemies. And, O ranger of"
1155,SECTION XII.,"the night, I will exterminate thy foe. Even if Sakra and the sun-god,"
1156,SECTION XII.,"even if fire and the War-god, even if Kuvera and Varuna should range"
1157,SECTION XII.,"themselves against me, I will fight them. Purandara himself shall be"
1158,SECTION XII.,"afflicted with fright when I have my body measuring a mountain, and"
1159,SECTION XII.,"furnished with sharp teeth, shall, setting up roars, fight with my huge"
1160,SECTION XII.,"bludgeon. Before Rāma shooteth a second shaft, to slay me, I shall drink"
1161,SECTION XII.,"his life-blood. Be thou comforted by slaying Daçaratha’s son, I will"
1162,SECTION XII.,exert to secure blessed victory for thee. Having killed Rāma along with
1163,SECTION XII.,"Lakshmana, I shall devour all the principal monkeys. Do thou make merry"
1164,SECTION XII.,"at thy will, drink the Varuni, and, with thy mind set at rest, conduct"
1165,SECTION XII.,affairs fraught with thy welfare. On Rāma being despatched to the
1166,SECTION XII.,"mansion of Yama, Sitā shall come under thy subjection for ever and a"
1167,SECTION XII.,"day""."

1189,SECTION XIII.,"Seeing Rāvana wrought up with wrath, the exceedingly strong Mahāpārcwa,"
1190,SECTION XIII.,"reflecting for a moment, observed with joined hands,—""The man that,"
1191,SECTION XIII.,"entering the forest, abounding with deer and ferocious animals, doth not"
1192,SECTION XIII.,"drink honey, maketh a fool of himself. O destroyer of foes, who is the"
1193,SECTION XIII.,"lord of thee, that art lord thyself? Enjoy with Vaidehi, taking thy"

1195,SECTION XIII.,"exerting thy might lead thy life, after the manner of hens, and invading"
1196,SECTION XIII.,"Sitā again and again, do thou enjoy her and derive pleasure (therefrom)."
1197,SECTION XIII.,And when thou hast attained thy purpose; what fear can succeed? Alike
1198,SECTION XIII.,"when on thy guard, and off it, thou shalt provide against all"
1199,SECTION XIII.,"exigencies. Kumbhakarna along with us, as well the exceedingly powerful"
1200,SECTION XIII.,"Indrajit, are competent to chastise the thunder-bearing (Deity) equipped"
1201,SECTION XIII.,"with his thunder. Passing by gift, conciliation, and dissension, which"
1202,SECTION XIII.,"have been assigned by the wise as the means of success, I relish the"
1203,SECTION XIII.,success in business which is attained through chastisement. O highly
1204,SECTION XIII.,"powerful one, we shall, without doubt, by the prowess of our arms,"
1205,SECTION XIII.,"subdue all these enemies of thine that have come hither"". Thus addressed"
1206,SECTION XIII.,"by Mahāpārcwa, king Rāvana, honoring his speech, said,—""O Mahāpārcwa, I"
1207,SECTION XIII.,"will relate unto thee, who hast spoken (thus) a secret matter relating"
1208,SECTION XIII.,"to myself, which befell me to since I saw Panjikasthalā, like a flame in"
1209,SECTION XIII.,"the sky, coursing to the Great-father’s mansion. Her pace slackened, as"
1210,SECTION XIII.,"soon as she saw me, (turn) I feasted on her and deprived her of her"
1211,SECTION XIII.,attire. Then she went to the Great-father’s place like a crumpled lotus.
1212,SECTION XIII.,That high-souled one received information of all that I had done; and
1213,SECTION XIII.,"thereat, waxed enraged, the Deity spoke unto me,—""If from this day, thou"
1214,SECTION XIII.,"ravish a female by force, thy head certainly shall be riven in an"
1215,SECTION XIII.,"hundred pieces. It is for this, that with my mind afflicted with fear, I"
1216,SECTION XIII.,"do not violently force, Videha’s daughter Sitā, anent lying with her"

1220,SECTION XIII.,resembling Death wrought up by wrath? Rāma hath not seen shafts shot by
1221,SECTION XIII.,"me, resembling two-tongued serpents and therefore, it is that he"
1222,SECTION XIII.,"approacheth me. Like a met burning an elephant, I shall, with shafts"
1223,SECTION XIII.,"shot from bows by hundreds, resembling the thunder-bolt, consume Rāma."
1224,SECTION XIII.,And as at the proper hour the risen Sun defeateth the splendor of the
1225,SECTION XIII.,"stars, will I, surrounded by a mighty army, overpower his strength."
1226,SECTION XIII.,"Neither the thousand eyed Vāsava, nor Varuna, is capable of fighting me."

1255,SECTION XIV.,"Vibhishana, seeking the welfare of the king, and having his intellect"

1258,SECTION XIV.,"what the king, Mahodara, thou, and Kumbhakarna, are saying with"

1325,SECTION XV.,"in disguise, since knowing of his destruction from Rāghava, thou dost"

1329,SECTION XV.,"devoid of humility, of an irritable temper, of feeble sense,"
1330,SECTION XV.,"vicious-minded and of a silly understanding. And thou dost speak so,"
1331,SECTION XV.,"being impelled by childishness. Who shall withstand in battle, the"
1332,SECTION XV.,"shafts, shot by Rāghava, resembling the rod of Death, the stick of"

1344,SECTION XVI.,"accents.—""It is better to live with open enemies or enraged serpents"
1345,SECTION XVI.,than with those who pass for friends but are in reality foes. I know
1346,SECTION XVI.,"well the nature of kinsmen, in all the worlds, O Rakhasa,—one takes"
1347,SECTION XVI.,"delight in another’s misfortune. The kinsmen, O Rākshasa, generally"
1348,SECTION XVI.,"disregard him who is their king,⁴² protecteth the kingdom, educated and"
1349,SECTION XVI.,"pious—and they always try to discomfit him, if he be a hero. These"
1350,SECTION XVI.,"terrible enemies—the kinsmen, hypocrite as they are, always take delight"
1351,SECTION XVI.,"in one another’s calamity. Hear, I shall relate what the elephants, in"
1352,SECTION XVI.,"yore, spoke beholding some persons with noose in hand—""We do not fear,"
1353,SECTION XVI.,"fire, weapons, or even the terrible noose—we fear only the dreadful"
1354,SECTION XVI.,"kinsmen, blinded with selfishness. They alone unfold the means of our"
1355,SECTION XVI.,destruction—there is not the least doubt about it. Fear from kinsmen is
1356,SECTION XVI.,"therefore known as the worst of all fears. In kine there is milk, in"
1357,SECTION XVI.,"kinsmen, there is fear, in women there is fickleness, and in Brahmanas,"
1358,SECTION XVI.,"there is asceticism. It doth not please thee, I fancy, O gentle one,"
1359,SECTION XVI.,"that I am honored of the three worlds, the lord of riches, and the"
1360,SECTION XVI.,subduer of my foes. As the drops of water do not last long on the leaves
1361,SECTION XVI.,"of lotuses, so is the friendship with unworthy persons. As the autumnal"
1362,SECTION XVI.,"clouds, albeit muttering, do not pour forth water, so is the friendship"
1363,SECTION XVI.,with unworthy persons. As a bee flies away after sucking up the honey so
1364,SECTION XVI.,"is the friendship with unworthy persons. As a bee, after feeding upon"
1365,SECTION XVI.,"the Kāça flowers, doth not get honey so is (fruitless) the friendship"
1366,SECTION XVI.,"with unworthy persons. As an elephant, after being bathed, covers its"
1367,SECTION XVI.,"body again with dust, taking it with its trunk, so is the friendship"
1368,SECTION XVI.,"with unworthy persons.⁴³ Fie thee, O monkey, O thou that bringest"
1369,SECTION XVI.,disgrace on the family. Had any one else spoken thus he would have
1370,SECTION XVI.,"ceased to live by this time"". Being thus accosted harshly, Bibhisana,"
1371,SECTION XVI.,"speaking truth, rose up along with four Rākshasas having maces in their"
1372,SECTION XVI.,"hands. Thereupon, rising up in the welkin, the graceful brother"
1373,SECTION XVI.,"Bibhisana, worked up with ire, addressed the lord of Rākshasas—""Thou art"
1374,SECTION XVI.,"mistaken, O king. Do thou speak what thou wishest—thou art my elder"
1375,SECTION XVI.,"brother, adorable like unto father—thou dost not follow the track of"
1376,SECTION XVI.,"virtue. I cannot tolerate the harsh accents of thine, my elder"
1377,SECTION XVI.,"brother.—For thy welfare I spoke those well-meaning words, O Ten-necked"
1378,SECTION XVI.,"one, but thou didst not pay heed to them being brought under the control"
1379,SECTION XVI.,"of Death. O king, many are the persons who speak sweet words, but rare"
1380,SECTION XVI.,are they who can speak and hear unpalatable but well-meaning words. How
1381,SECTION XVI.,can I disregard thy death like unto a burning house bound as thou art by
1382,SECTION XVI.,"the noose of Death, the destroyer of all creatures. I do not wish to"
1383,SECTION XVI.,"behold thee slain by the well-sharpened shafts of Rāma, feathered in"
1384,SECTION XVI.,gold and resembling the flaming fire. Even the heroic and powerful
1385,SECTION XVI.,"persons, well versed in the use of weapons, wear away like sands in"
1386,SECTION XVI.,"battle, being attracted by Death. Thou art worshipful unto me, do thou"
1387,SECTION XVI.,forgive me for what I have said for thy welfare. Do thou protect thyself
1388,SECTION XVI.,"and this city, abounding in Rākshasas. May good betide thee! I am going"
1389,SECTION XVI.,"away and do thou be happy without me. What, I spoke unto thee, O ranger"
1390,SECTION XVI.,"of the night, to prevent thee, for thy welfare, did not please thee."
1391,SECTION XVI.,"Persons, whose lease of life is well-nigh expired, do not pay heed to"

1403,SECTION XVII.,"Having addressed Rāvana with these harsh words, his younger brother,"
1404,SECTION XVII.,"reached in no time, where Rāma along with Lakshmana was. The leading"
1405,SECTION XVII.,"monkeys, stationed on earth, espied him on the welkin, resembling in"
1406,SECTION XVII.,"size the summit of the mount Meru, and burning like lightning in the"
1407,SECTION XVII.,effulgence of his own person. And his four attendants of terrible
1408,SECTION XVII.,prowess were adorned with excellent ornaments and armed with armours and
1409,SECTION XVII.,"maces. He was like unto a collection of clouds, powerful as the"
1410,SECTION XVII.,"thunder-bolt, holding an excellent mace, heroic and embellished with"
1411,SECTION XVII.,"excellent ornaments. And beholding him along with four counsellors, the"
1412,SECTION XVII.,"highly intelligent Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, engaged in meditation"
1413,SECTION XVII.,"along with them. And meditating for a while, he spoke unto the monkeys"
1414,SECTION XVII.,"headed by Hanumān the following excellent words—""Behold, there comes a"
1415,SECTION XVII.,"Rākshasa, armed with various weapons and followed by four demons to slay"
1416,SECTION XVII.,"us and there is not the least doubt about it"". And hearing the words of"
1417,SECTION XVII.,"Sugriva, the excellent monkeys, taking up huge trees and crags, bespoke"
1418,SECTION XVII.,"him,—""Do thou order us, O king, to destroy these vicious-souleri demons."
1419,SECTION XVII.,"These shall crush them to death, limited as is the tenure of their"
1420,SECTION XVII.,"life"". They addressing each other in this wise, Bibhisana descended from"
1421,SECTION XVII.,the sky on the northern shore. And beholding Sugriva and all others
1422,SECTION XVII.,"stationed near him, the highly intelligent Bibhisana accosted them, at"
1423,SECTION XVII.,"the highest pitch of his voice, saying,—""Liveth there the Rākshasa,"
1424,SECTION XVII.,"Rāvana, the lord of demons, and perpetrator of many iniquitous deeds. I"
1425,SECTION XVII.,"am his younger brother known as Bibhisana. By him, slaying the vulture"
1426,SECTION XVII.,"Yatāyu, was carried away Sitā from Janasthāna. She is imprisoned,"
1427,SECTION XVII.,"brought under his sway, poorly, and being well guarded by the"
1428,SECTION XVII.,Rākshasees. With various well meaning words and reasonings I pointed out
1429,SECTION XVII.,"unto him, the necessity of rendering back Sitā unto Rāma. And Rāvana,"
1430,SECTION XVII.,"possessed by Death, paid no heed to my well-meaning words, like unto"
1431,SECTION XVII.,"one, lying on the brink of death, neglecting the administration of"
1432,SECTION XVII.,"medicine. Being reviled by him and treated harshly like a menial, I have"
1433,SECTION XVII.,"come to seek Rāghava’s shelter, renouncing my children and wives. Do ye"
1434,SECTION XVII.,"soon mention unto the high-souled Rāghava, the refuge of all creatures,"
1435,SECTION XVII.,"that Bibhisana hath arrived"". Hearing those words the quick-paced"
1436,SECTION XVII.,"Sugriva, excited with ire, spake unto Rāma, before Lakshinana,"
1437,SECTION XVII.,"saying,—""Forsooth hath an enemy entered secretly in our midst and he"
1438,SECTION XVII.,shall slay us getting an opportunity like unto an owl killing the crows.
1439,SECTION XVII.,"O slayer of foes, it now behoveth thee to be particularly careful about"
1440,SECTION XVII.,"the counsels, arrangement of soldiers, polity—civil and military and"
1441,SECTION XVII.,spies of our own party as well as those of the enemies. These Rākshasas
1442,SECTION XVII.,"are heroic; they assume shapes at will, always lie in ambush and"
1443,SECTION XVII.,secretly bring about others’ ruin—we should not therefore place
1444,SECTION XVII.,confidence in them. This must be the emissary of Rāvana—the lord of
1445,SECTION XVII.,"Rākshasas. Entering in our midst, he shall, in sooth, sow dissensions in"
1446,SECTION XVII.,"our camp, or he shall slay us when we are careless, confiding in them."
1447,SECTION XVII.,"Avoiding the enemies, we should now collect the forest-rangers our"
1448,SECTION XVII.,"friends and servants. O lord, this man is a Rākshasa by birth and the"
1449,SECTION XVII.,"brother of our foe and so is he our enemy, how can we trust him?"
1450,SECTION XVII.,"Rāvana’s younger brother, known as Bibhishana, hath come here with four"
1451,SECTION XVII.,"Rākshasas, to seek thy shelter. O thou the foremost of forgiving"
1452,SECTION XVII.,"persons, I consider this Bibhishana, who hath been despatched by Rāvana,"
1453,SECTION XVII.,worthy of being slain. Being impelled by his wicked intention and
1454,SECTION XVII.,"commissioned by Rāvana, this Rākshasa hath come here and secretly by"
1455,SECTION XVII.,"virtue of his illussive powers he shall slay thee, O innocent one, when"
1456,SECTION XVII.,"thou shalt place confidence in him"". Having thus accosted Rāma, skilled"
1457,SECTION XVII.,"in the art of speech, that lord of the army, Sugriva, well versed in"
1458,SECTION XVII.,"speech, became silent. And hearing the words of Sugriva, the mighty Rāma"
1459,SECTION XVII.,"spake unto the monkeys, near him, headed by Hanumān, saying,—""Ye have"
1460,SECTION XVII.,"all heard, the words well grounded in reason, the lord of monkeys hath"
1461,SECTION XVII.,"said, regarding Rāvana’s younger brother. It behoveth him, who desireth"
1462,SECTION XVII.,"for perpetual wealth, and is intelligent and capable of giving sound"
1463,SECTION XVII.,"counsels, to advise his friends in difficult matters"". Being thus"
1464,SECTION XVII.,addressed by Rāma (to minister unto him best counsels) all those
1465,SECTION XVII.,"monkeys, intent upon encompassing his well-being, gave out their"
1466,SECTION XVII.,"respective opinions. ""O Rāghava, there is nothing beyond thy knowledge"
1467,SECTION XVII.,"in the three worlds. It is only to show thy respect towards us, O Rāma,"
1468,SECTION XVII.,"that thou dost accost us in this wise. Thou art of truthful vows,"
1469,SECTION XVII.,"heroic, pious, of firm prowess, discriminating, recollecting and having"
1470,SECTION XVII.,implicit confidence in thy friends. Let the intelligent and capable
1471,SECTION XVII.,"counsellors deliver their reasonable opinions unto thee"". They speaking"
1472,SECTION XVII.,"thus unto Rāghava, the intelligent monkey Angada, spoke as follows for"
1473,SECTION XVII.,"sounding the intention of Bibhishana,—""We should always suspect him"
1474,SECTION XVII.,"since he has come from the side of our enemies, and should not, all on a"
1475,SECTION XVII.,"sudden, place confidence in him. The wicked-minded always move about"
1476,SECTION XVII.,"hiding their real self, and bring about peoples’ calamity, taking"
1477,SECTION XVII.,advantage of their weak points. And great is the disaster thereof. It is
1478,SECTION XVII.,"always proper to engage in actions, considering what is right and what"
1479,SECTION XVII.,is wrong. Virtues should always be gathered and vices abandoned. Do thou
1480,SECTION XVII.,"renounce him unhesitatingly, if dost thou find in him a source of a"
1481,SECTION XVII.,great calamity and do thou embrace him if dost thou find him crowned
1482,SECTION XVII.,"with many virtues"". Thereupon followed Sarava with words fraught with"
1483,SECTION XVII.,"high import,—""O best of men, do thou speedily despatch emissaries to"
1484,SECTION XVII.,"sound Bibhishana. If dost thou, sounding him well through the"
1485,SECTION XVII.,"instrumentality of sharp spies, find him friendly, do thou win him over"
1486,SECTION XVII.,"to thy side"". Thereupon the wise Jāmbavān, arriving at conclusions by"
1487,SECTION XVII.,"virtue of his knowledge of _Sastras_, began with words, void of"
1488,SECTION XVII.,"defects,—""Surely doth Bibhishana come from the vicious lord of"
1489,SECTION XVII.,"Rākshasas, dead set against us and hath arrived at such a bad place and"
1490,SECTION XVII.,"in such a bad hour. We should always fear him"". And thereupon followed"
1491,SECTION XVII.,"Mainda, conversant with what is right and wrong, after due deliberation,"
1492,SECTION XVII.,"with words pregnant with reason,—""He is Rāvana’s younger brother, by"
1493,SECTION XVII.,name Bibhishana. Let the lord of men ask him every thing at first in
1494,SECTION XVII.,"sweet words. Do thou first ascertain, O foremost of men, with what"
1495,SECTION XVII.,intention he hath come—evil or good—and then settle what course to
1496,SECTION XVII.,"adopt"". Thereupon spake Hanumān, the foremost of the counsellors and"
1497,SECTION XVII.,"well versed in _Sastras_, in accents sweet, glorious and fraught with a"
1498,SECTION XVII.,"high value,—""Even Vrihaspati, (the lord of speech) cannot excell thee,"
1499,SECTION XVII.,"capable,⁴⁴ gifted with the best of intellect and foremost of those"
1500,SECTION XVII.,"skilled in the art of speech, as thou art. And what I know I speak, O"
1501,SECTION XVII.,"king. I do so, in the interest of Rāma’s work and not impelled by my"
1502,SECTION XVII.,"skill in the art of speech, by the pride of being a counsellor, by the"
1503,SECTION XVII.,vanity of being gifted with a high intellect or by the desire of
1504,SECTION XVII.,speaking for its own sake. What thy counsellors have said for
1505,SECTION XVII.,ascertaining the good or evil intention of Bibhishana appeareth to me as
1506,SECTION XVII.,most defective and productive of no consequence whatever. It is
1507,SECTION XVII.,impossible to sound him without any command.⁴⁵ And even to command him
1508,SECTION XVII.,now for the same appears to me as improper. And as regards the despatch
1509,SECTION XVII.,"of spies, anent what thou hast been advised by thy ministers, I do not"
1510,SECTION XVII.,"observe any utility. And what little I have thought of, I have something"
1511,SECTION XVII.,to say (regarding Jāmbavān’s proposal) that Bibhishana hath arrived at
1512,SECTION XVII.,such a bad place and in such an evil hour. He has really come to a very
1513,SECTION XVII.,good place and in a very good hour. And truly has he performed a
1514,SECTION XVII.,becoming and sensible action by coming here after duly ascertaining that
1515,SECTION XVII.,Rāvana is a vicious wight and thou art a pious person—he is full of
1516,SECTION XVII.,vices—thou art gifted with many virtues—he is tyrranical and thou art
1517,SECTION XVII.,"powerful. And what they hate said, O king, as regards sounding him"
1518,SECTION XVII.,"through secret spies, appears to me as one requiring great wisdom. An"
1519,SECTION XVII.,"intelligent man, when questioned by any suddenly, suspects many things."
1520,SECTION XVII.,And if the new-comer be a friend and has come here for his own
1521,SECTION XVII.,"happiness, how greatly shall his mind be changed by such a course?"
1522,SECTION XVII.,Besides by a sudden questioning it is impossible to ascertain the
1523,SECTION XVII.,intention of a foreigner. Do thou therefore thyself accost him and
1524,SECTION XVII.,"determine, by his voice, his secret motive. I did not however mark"
1525,SECTION XVII.,anything of his wickedness while he spoke; rather I did observe signs of
1526,SECTION XVII.,gladness on his countenance. So I do not suspect him. The wily can never
1527,SECTION XVII.,come fearless and undisturbed. Nor were his words cunning. So I do not
1528,SECTION XVII.,suspect him. It is not very easy to hide one’s real nature. It manifests
1529,SECTION XVII.,itself by force. So this action of Bibhishana is not out of place or
1530,SECTION XVII.,season. When accomplished it shall redound to his own interest.
1531,SECTION XVII.,"Considering well thy preparations for war and Rāvana’s vain conduct,"
1532,SECTION XVII.,"hearing of Vāli’s destruction and Sugriva’s installation on the throne,"
1533,SECTION XVII.,"he hath, impelled by his good sense, come here, desirous of gaining the"
1534,SECTION XVII.,"kingdom. Taking these into account, it seems prudent to take him to our"
1535,SECTION XVII.,"side. O thou the foremost of the intelligent, I have spoken thus"
1536,SECTION XVII.,considering him sincere. It now behoveth thee to perform what thou
1537,SECTION XVII.,"thinkest proper""."

1548,SECTION XVIII.,"Hearing those words of the Wind-god’s son, the irrepressible Rāma,"
1549,SECTION XVIII.,"conversant with all the Sāstras, replied, with words expressing his own"
1550,SECTION XVIII.,"opinion—""I have also thought of some thing regarding Bibhishana. I wish"
1551,SECTION XVIII.,"you all, interested in my well-being, to hear that. (Bibhishana) hath"
1552,SECTION XVIII.,come here as a friend so I cannot forsake him by any means. And even if
1553,SECTION XVIII.,he has come with any evil intent it is not culpable for the pious to
1554,SECTION XVIII.,"afford him shelter"". Thereupon hearing his words and considering them"
1555,SECTION XVIII.,"well, Sugriva, the lord of the monkeys, replied in more auspicious⁴⁶"
1556,SECTION XVIII.,"words,—""Whether this ranger of the night is sincere or wicked, he should"
1557,SECTION XVIII.,"never be offered any shelter, since he hath forsaken his brother in the"
1558,SECTION XVIII.,midst of these calamities. What reason is there to believe that he shall
1559,SECTION XVIII.,"not renounce us in our difficulty?"" Hearing the words of the lord of"
1560,SECTION XVIII.,"monkeys and casting his looks towards them, Kākutstha, having truth for"
1561,SECTION XVIII.,"his prowess, smiling a little, spake, unto Lakshmana, crowned with all"
1562,SECTION XVIII.,"the marks of piety, saying—""Without being conversant with _Sastras_, and"
1563,SECTION XVIII.,"living in the company of old men, none can speak such words as have been"
1564,SECTION XVIII.,"uttered by the king of the monkeys. There appear unto me, however two"
1565,SECTION XVIII.,"subtler reasons anent the difference between brothers, amongst the"
1566,SECTION XVIII.,kings—one is evident and another mundane. There are two classes of
1567,SECTION XVIII.,foes—one consisting of the members of the same line the other of the
1568,SECTION XVIII.,neighbours. And these generally bring about our misfortune whenever any
1569,SECTION XVIII.,opportunity presents itself. And it is for this that he hath come here.
1570,SECTION XVIII.,"Those kinsmen, who do not think of one another’s mischief, generally"
1571,SECTION XVIII.,long for their respective well-being. But even such well-meaning
1572,SECTION XVIII.,"relatives are feared by the kings. And hear, I shall relate, what the"
1573,SECTION XVIII.,_Sastras_ say regarding the weak points thou hast mentioned as to the
1574,SECTION XVIII.,advisability of taking the enemies to our side. We are not his kinsmen
1575,SECTION XVIII.,and this Rākshasa hath come here with a view to gain the kingdom. Even
1576,SECTION XVIII.,the Rākshasas are wise enough to ascertain the proper course—so we must
1577,SECTION XVIII.,take Bibhishana. If the brothers are confident and satisfied with each
1578,SECTION XVIII.,"other they generally live together, or else they fear each other and"
1579,SECTION XVIII.,ultimately engage in a tumultuous war. And there hath sprung up some
1580,SECTION XVIII.,"difference with Rāvana and therefore Bibhishana hath come here. Nor are,"
1581,SECTION XVIII.,"O friend, all brothers like Bharata, all sons like me unto their father,"
1582,SECTION XVIII.,"all friends like thee"". Being thus addressed by Rāma, the highly wise"
1583,SECTION XVIII.,"Sugriva, along with Lakshmana, rose up and bending low his head, said—""O"
1584,SECTION XVIII.,"thou the best of all forgiving persons, this night-ranger hath been"
1585,SECTION XVIII.,despatched by Rāvana. I therefore think it better to kill him. Being
1586,SECTION XVIII.,"impelled by his vicious sense that Rākshasa hath come here to slay us, O"
1587,SECTION XVIII.,"innocent one, when myself, thou and Lakshmana shall consider ourselves"
1588,SECTION XVIII.,"secure. Therefore the large-armed Bibhisana, the younger brother of the"
1589,SECTION XVIII.,"ruthless Rāvana, deserves to be slain along with his counsellors""."
1590,SECTION XVIII.,"Having thus addressed (Rāma) the foremost of Raghu’s race, skilled in"
1591,SECTION XVIII.,"art of speech, Sugriva, the lord of monkey host, equally versed in the"
1592,SECTION XVIII.,"art of speech, became silent. And hearing the words of Sugriva, and"
1593,SECTION XVIII.,"weighing them, Rāma again addressed the foremost of monkeys with more"
1594,SECTION XVIII.,"reasonable accents—""Wicked or otherwise, whatever this night-ranger may"
1595,SECTION XVIII.,"be, he shall not be able to do me the least mischief. Pisachas, Dānavas,"
1596,SECTION XVIII.,"Yakshas or all the Rākshasas on earth,—I can slay them all, if I like,"
1597,SECTION XVIII.,"with the tips of my fingers, O thou the lord of monkeys. I have heard of"
1598,SECTION XVIII.,"a pigeon adoring and entertaining with its own flesh, an enemy who took"
1599,SECTION XVIII.,"its shelter. While a pigeon received so friendly its enemy, the slayer"
1600,SECTION XVIII.,"of its mate, how can I then act otherwise, O foremost of the monkeys? Do"
1601,SECTION XVIII.,"thou hear, I shall relate, a sacred story, narrated by the great"
1602,SECTION XVIII.,"ascetic, the truthful Kandu, son of the ascetic Kanya. O slayer of foes,"
1603,SECTION XVIII.,"even a wicked-minded enemy, if he, with folded palms and a poor heart,"
1604,SECTION XVIII.,"craveth for thy shelter, should not be slain. If an enemy, proud or"
1605,SECTION XVIII.,"terrified, seeketh shelter in affright, he should be saved by a great"
1606,SECTION XVIII.,"man even at the risk of his own life. One, who from fear, ignorance or"
1607,SECTION XVIII.,"wilfully doth not protect him who seeketh his shelter, perpetrateth a"
1608,SECTION XVIII.,"mighty iniquity, blamed of all. When a person is slain before him whose"
1609,SECTION XVIII.,shelter he hath taken he taketh away all the virtues of his protector.
1610,SECTION XVIII.,So great is the sin in not affording shelter unto those who seek for it;
1611,SECTION XVIII.,"it standeth in the way of going to heaven, bringeth in calumny and"
1612,SECTION XVIII.,destroyeth the strength and prowess. I shall therefore follow the
1613,SECTION XVIII.,"excellent words of Kandu—leading to piety, fame and the attainment of"
1614,SECTION XVIII.,the abode of the celestials. I always declare ’no fear’ unto all
1615,SECTION XVIII.,"creatures, whenever any, approaching me, says, ’I am thine’ and seeketh"
1616,SECTION XVIII.,"my shelter. Even this is my pious observance. O Sugriva, O foremost of"
1617,SECTION XVIII.,"monkeys, do thou soon bring him here, whether he be Rāvana or Bibhishana"
1618,SECTION XVIII.,"and I shall declare unto him ’no fear’. Hearing the words of Rāma,"
1619,SECTION XVIII.,"Sugriva, the lords of those who go bounding, over-flowing with"
1620,SECTION XVIII.,"friendliness, bespake Kākutstha.—""What wonder is there that thou wouldst"
1621,SECTION XVIII.,"speak these auspicious words, O thou the foremost of kings, conversant"
1622,SECTION XVIII.,"with morality, gifted with prowess and ever treading the pious track as"
1623,SECTION XVIII.,thou art. Truly doth my inner self regard Bibhisana as devoid of any
1624,SECTION XVIII.,wicked intention. He has been well sounded by signs and gestures. And
1625,SECTION XVIII.,"let the greatly wise Bibhisana, Rāghava, be placed on an equal footing"
1626,SECTION XVIII.,"with us and gain our friendship"". Hearing the words of Sugriva, the lord"
1627,SECTION XVIII.,"of monkeys, the king of men (Rāma) made instantly friends with"
1628,SECTION XVIII.,"Bibhisana, like unto the conqueror of enemies’ cities making friends"

1638,SECTION XIX.,"Raghava thus declaring unto him ’no fear’, Rāvana’s younger brother, the"
1639,SECTION XIX.,"greatly wise Bibhisana, bending low his head, cast his looks on the"
1640,SECTION XIX.,earth. And descending from the welkin with his devoted attendants the
1641,SECTION XIX.,"virtuous-souled Bibhisana, delighted, bowed unto Rāma. And thereupon"
1642,SECTION XIX.,"touching his feet along with four Rākshasas, Bibhisana addressed"
1643,SECTION XIX.,"Rāma,—with words, fraught with piety, befitting the occasion and"
1644,SECTION XIX.,"conducing to pleasure. ""I am Rāvana’s younger brother and have been"
1645,SECTION XIX.,"greatly insulted by him, I have therefore come to seek thy shelter, the"
1646,SECTION XIX.,"refuge of all creatures, abandoning Lankā, and renouncing my friends and"
1647,SECTION XIX.,"riches. My kingdom, life and happiness are all at thy disposal"". Hearing"
1648,SECTION XIX.,"his words Rāma replied,—comforting him with words and favouring him as"
1649,SECTION XIX.,"if with looks. ""Do thou relate unto me truly the strength and weakness"
1650,SECTION XIX.,"of the enemies"". Being thus accosted by Rāma of unwearied actions, the"
1651,SECTION XIX.,"Raksha, began to describe the strength of Rāvana. ""O prince, by virtue"
1652,SECTION XIX.,"of the boon acquired from the Self-Create, the Ten-necked one is"
1653,SECTION XIX.,"incapable of being slain by all creatures—Gandharbas, serpents, or"
1654,SECTION XIX.,birds. My elder brother—the one next to Rāvana—is the heroic and highly
1655,SECTION XIX.,"effulgent _Kumbharkarna_—Sakra’s equal in battle. Thou mayst have heard,"
1656,SECTION XIX.,"O Rāma, his commander is Prahasta, by whom was defeated Manibhadra on"
1657,SECTION XIX.,"the mount Kailāça. (His son) Indrajit, equipped with invincible armour,"
1658,SECTION XIX.,"bow and finger-protector made of the skin of iguana, becomes invisible"
1659,SECTION XIX.,"in fight. And, worshipping Fire and becoming invisible, that graceful"
1660,SECTION XIX.,"hero, O Rāghava, slayeth the enemies in conflict, having the contending"
1661,SECTION XIX.,"parties vast and well arranged. Mahodara, Mahāpārcwa and the Rākshasa,"
1662,SECTION XIX.,"Akampana, are his lieutenants, who equal the Lokapālas⁴⁷ in battle. His"
1663,SECTION XIX.,"army consists of ten thousand _kotis_ of Rākshasas, wearing shapes at"
1664,SECTION XIX.,"will, inhabiting the city of Lankā, and living on flesh and gore. And"
1665,SECTION XIX.,"with the _Lokapālas_ and the celestials, they were all defeated by the"
1666,SECTION XIX.,"vicious-souled Rāvana"". Hearing the words of Bibhisana and weighing them"
1667,SECTION XIX.,"in his mind, that foremost of Raghu’s race said—""I understand well the"
1668,SECTION XIX.,"strength and prowess of Rāvana, which thou hast depicted truly, O"
1669,SECTION XIX.,Bibhisana. Do thou hear truly that I shall slay the Ten-necked one
1670,SECTION XIX.,"together with Prahasta and his sons, and I shall make thee king. Whether"
1671,SECTION XIX.,"he entereth the _Rasātala_⁴⁸ or the regions under the earth, or seeketh"
1672,SECTION XIX.,"shelter of the Grand-father of the celestials, he shall not be able to"
1673,SECTION XIX.,save his life from me. I do swear by my three brethern that I shall
1674,SECTION XIX.,"enter the city of Ayodhyā, after slaying in battle Rāvana with his sons,"
1675,SECTION XIX.,"kinsmen and friends"". Hearing these words of Rāma of unwearied action,"
1676,SECTION XIX.,"the virtuous-souled (Bibhisana), bowing his head unto him, began—""I"
1677,SECTION XIX.,shall lend thee my might in slaying the Rākshasas and devastating the
1678,SECTION XIX.,"city of Lankā, and shall be in the midst of Rāvana’s army"". Thereupon,"
1679,SECTION XIX.,"embracing Bibhisana, who spoke thus, Rāma, delighted, said unto"
1680,SECTION XIX.,"Lakshmana,—""O my brother, do thou bring water from the ocean. Sprinkling"
1681,SECTION XIX.,"the greatly wise Bibhisana, I shall make him at once the king of the"
1682,SECTION XIX.,"Rākshasas, O conferer of honor; for I am greatly pleased with him""."
1683,SECTION XIX.,"Being thus addressed, Saumitri, at the command of the king, annointed"
1684,SECTION XIX.,Bibhisana and made him the king of the Rākshasas in the presence of the
1685,SECTION XIX.,"monkey-host. Beholding Rāma’s kindness (towards Bibhisana), the monkeys"
1686,SECTION XIX.,"eulogized the high-souled one, exclaiming ""Excellent! Excellent!"""
1687,SECTION XIX.,"Thereupon, Hanumān and Sugriva addressed Bibhisana, saying, ""Do thou"
1688,SECTION XIX.,"tell us how we shall cross over the main—the abode of Varuna, along with"
1689,SECTION XIX.,the host of the highly powerful monkeys. Do thou inform us of the means
1690,SECTION XIX.,"by which we may cross over, along with our army, the lord of rivers and"
1691,SECTION XIX.,"streams—the abode of Varuna"". Being thus addressed, the virtuous-souled"
1692,SECTION XIX.,"Bibhisana replied,—""It behoveth the king, Rāghava, to seek refuge from"
1693,SECTION XIX.,the Ocean. This measureless deep was dug out by (the king) Sagara.⁴⁹ And
1694,SECTION XIX.,"the great Ocean shall surely help Rāma belonging to Sagara’s race""."
1695,SECTION XIX.,"Being thus accosted by the wise Rākshasa, Bibhishana. Sugriva reached"
1696,SECTION XIX.,"where Rāma with Lakshmana was. Thereupon, the broad-necked Sugriva began"
1697,SECTION XIX.,"to explain the well-meaning words of Bibhishana, requesting Rāma to seek"
1698,SECTION XIX.,"the shelter of the Ocean. And those words pleased Rāma, pious by nature."
1699,SECTION XIX.,"And the highly eflulgent (hero) requested, smiling, the active Lakshmana"
1700,SECTION XIX.,and the monkey-chief Sugriva to collect necessaries for his adoration.
1701,SECTION XIX.,"""O Lakshmana, this counsel of Bibhisana appeareth to me as most sound."
1702,SECTION XIX.,"Sugriva is always greatly wise, and thou art greatly proficient in"
1703,SECTION XIX.,"counsel. Do ye, holding a conference, intimate to me what you think"
1704,SECTION XIX.,"becoming"". Thus addressed, those two heroes—Lakshmana and Sugriva, spoke"
1705,SECTION XIX.,"respectfully the following words fraught with propriety,—""Why shall not"
1706,SECTION XIX.,"the well-meaning words of Bibhisana expressed now, please us, O Rāghava,"
1707,SECTION XIX.,"O thou best of men? Without constructing a bridge over the deep, the"
1708,SECTION XIX.,"terrible abode of Varuna, even the celestials and their lord (Indra)"
1709,SECTION XIX.,cannot get at the city of Lankā. Do thou act on the genuine counsel of
1710,SECTION XIX.,"the heroic Bibhisana, and without losing time, do thou engage the Ocean"
1711,SECTION XIX.,"for this work, so that we may with our army proceed to the city of"
1712,SECTION XIX.,"Rāvana"". Being thus addressed Rāma reached the shore of the lord of"

1733,SECTION XX.,"army all busy, the emissary of the vicious-souled Rākshasa—Rāvana,"
1734,SECTION XX.,"entered the city of Lankā and, approaching his lord, said,—""The army of"
1735,SECTION XX.,monkeys and bears hath approached Lankā. It is immeasurably deep as the

1737,SECTION XX.,"Lakshmana, gifted with great beauty, coming to rescue Sitā, have"
1738,SECTION XX.,"stationed themselves on the shore of the ocean, O thou of great"
1739,SECTION XX.,effulgence. The army of Rāma extends over the sky and ten _yojanas_. I
1740,SECTION XX.,"have come, O great king, to acquaint thee with the real truth. And,"
1741,SECTION XX.,"knowing everything, it behoveth thy emissaries, O king, to settle"
1742,SECTION XX.,"whether to render back Sitā, to adopt measures of conciliation, or to"

1745,SECTION XX.,"addressed a Rākshasa by name Suka, the most sensible of his counsellors,"

1747,SECTION XX.,"Sugriva my behest, in becoming and excellent accents. ’Thou art born of"
1748,SECTION XX.,a great family and art the mighty son of the king of bears. I have no
1749,SECTION XX.,"dissension with thee. In fact I consider thee as my brother, O king of"

1751,SECTION XX.,"(Rāma), yet what is that to thee, O Sugriva? Do thou return to"

1753,SECTION XX.,city of Lankā. Even the celestials and Gandharbas could not—what of
1754,SECTION XX.,"these men and monkeys?’"" And being thus commissioned by the lord of"
1755,SECTION XX.,"Rākshasas, that night-ranger assumed the shape of a bird and, bounding,"
1756,SECTION XX.,"speedily reached the sky. And, proceeding far over the deep and"
1757,SECTION XX.,"stationing himself at the welkin, he spoke unto Sugriva all the words"
1758,SECTION XX.,with which he was addressed by the vicious-souled Rāvana. Hearing him
1759,SECTION XX.,"speak thus, the monkeys leaped up quickly and reached there with a view"
1760,SECTION XX.,to chop off his wings or to slay him with their clenched fists. On being
1761,SECTION XX.,"seized vehemently by all these monkeys, that night-ranger was brought"
1762,SECTION XX.,down speedily from the sky to the earth. And being assailed by the
1763,SECTION XX.,"monkeys, Suka said,—""O Kākutstha, it doth not behove (people) to slay an"

1767,SECTION XX.,"Rāma spake unto the monkeys, who were about to kill him, saying, ""Do not"
1768,SECTION XX.,"kill him"". And again stationing himself on the welkin, that night-ranger"
1769,SECTION XX.,"said,—""O Sugriva, O thou gifted with great energy, O thou of great"

1775,SECTION XX.,dost therefore deserve to be slain by him like Vāli along with thy
1776,SECTION XX.,"friends and relatives. I shall therefore slay thee, O king of"
1777,SECTION XX.,"night-rangers, together with thy sons, friends and relatives. And I"

1783,SECTION XX.,"do not behold any in these three worlds—Pisācha, Rākshasa, Gandharba, or"

1786,SECTION XX.,large-eyed Sitā from the vicinity of Rāma and the neighbourhood of
1787,SECTION XX.,"Lakshmana; but, having captured her, thou understandest not (thy native"

1789,SECTION XX.,"high-souled, possessed of great strength, and incapable of being"
1790,SECTION XX.,"repressed even by the celestials,—who shall take thy life"". Then spake"
1791,SECTION XX.,"that best of monkeys, Angada, son of Vāli,—""O highly wise one, this is"
1792,SECTION XX.,no emissary. This one clearly appeareth to me as a spy. He hath come to

1816,SECTION XXI.,"East. And that slayer of foes (lay down), making his pillow his arm"
1817,SECTION XXI.,resembling the shining form of a serpent; always dight with golden
1818,SECTION XXI.,ornaments; full many a time pressed with the palms of beauteous
1819,SECTION XXI.,"damsels,⁵¹ decked with jewelled golden _Keyuras_ and superb ornaments"
1820,SECTION XXI.,studded with pearls; smeared from above with sandal and _aguru_; (his

1822,SECTION XXI.,unto the body of Takshaka under the waters of the Gangā; resembling a

1825,SECTION XXI.,strokes of the bow-string; which was the refuge of the entire earth;—his
1826,SECTION XXI.,"right arm resembling a mighty bludgeon,—the donor of thousands of"

1829,SECTION XXI.,"resolution in respect of the great deep, Rāma, restraining his speech,"
1830,SECTION XXI.,with a concentrated mind lay down there agreeably to rule. And as Rāma
1831,SECTION XXI.,"slept on the earth on Kuça spread over, without ever swerving from the"
1832,SECTION XXI.,"rule, three nights passed away. And while spending three nights, Rāma,"
1833,SECTION XXI.,"learned in polity and attached to virtue, prayed unto that lord of"
1834,SECTION XXI.,"streams—the Ocean. Yet the wicked Ocean, albeit adored according to his"
1835,SECTION XXI.,"deserts by Rāma with his mind concentrated, did not show himself."
1836,SECTION XXI.,Thereat Rāma grew enraged and had the corners of his eyes crimsoned; and
1837,SECTION XXI.,"he spake unto Lakshmana of auspicious marks, saying,—""Behold the hauteur"
1838,SECTION XXI.,"of the Ocean in not presenting himself before me. Calmness, forbearance,"
1839,SECTION XXI.,"candour, and soft speech—these virtues of the good are by the insolent"
1840,SECTION XXI.,taken for the effects of incompetency. The person⁵² that is
1841,SECTION XXI.,"self-laudatory, wicked, and badly-bold, publisheth his own praise, and"
1842,SECTION XXI.,"meteth out chastisement every where,⁵³ is honored in the world. By"
1843,SECTION XXI.,"moderation one cannot attain celebrity, by moderation one cannot attain"
1844,SECTION XXI.,"fame,—and, O Lakshmana, in this world by moderation one cannot attain"
1845,SECTION XXI.,"victory on ’the edge of battle.’⁵⁴ See, O Sumitrā’s son, the abode of"
1846,SECTION XXI.,"Makaras, with his waters obstructed all around with Makaras destroyed by"
1847,SECTION XXI.,"my shafts. And, O Lakshmana, see the bodies here of serpents, and the"
1848,SECTION XXI.,"huge bodies of mighty fishes, and the trunks of elephants,—torn by my"
1849,SECTION XXI.,arrows. And to-day in terrible battle will I dry up the Ocean with
1850,SECTION XXI.,"conchs and oysters, and fishes and Makaras. This abode of Makaras taketh"
1851,SECTION XXI.,"me, who is forbearing, to be incompetent. Fie on forbearance towards"
1852,SECTION XXI.,"such as he! In consequence of my moderation, Ocean showeth not his own"
1853,SECTION XXI.,"form. O Saumitri, bring thou my bow, my arrows resembling venomous"
1854,SECTION XXI.,"snakes. I will dry up the Ocean, and the monkeys shall go over on foot."
1855,SECTION XXI.,"And, being angered, to-day, albeit incapable of being agitated, will I"
1856,SECTION XXI.,"agitate the deep. And by means of my shafts will I make Varuna’s abode,"
1857,SECTION XXI.,surging with a thousand billows and having his dignity maintained by his
1858,SECTION XXI.,"shores,—overleap his continents. And I will agitate the deep harbouring"
1859,SECTION XXI.,"numbers of mighty Dānavas"". Having spoken thus, Rāma, equipped with his"
1860,SECTION XXI.,"bow, with his eyes dilated in wrath, became exceedingly irrepressible,"
1861,SECTION XXI.,like unto the flaming fire at the final dissolution. And straining his
1862,SECTION XXI.,"dreadful bow, making the earth shake, tremulously, he let fly fierce"
1863,SECTION XXI.,shafts like him of an hundred sacrifices hurling his thunder-bolt.
1864,SECTION XXI.,"Thereat, flaming up, those vehement choice shafts surcharged with"
1865,SECTION XXI.,"energy, enter into the waters of the sea, with its serpents afflicted"
1866,SECTION XXI.,with fear. And then great and exceedingly dreadful was the motion of the
1867,SECTION XXI.,"sea, with fishes and Makaras, and with the roar of the winds (blowing"
1868,SECTION XXI.,"there). And on a sudden the mighty deep was heaving with mighty surges,"
1869,SECTION XXI.,"with conchs scattered about, and a smoke (enveloped) the ocean; and the"
1870,SECTION XXI.,"billows became visible on all sides. And the serpents were distressed,"
1871,SECTION XXI.,with their faces flaming and their eyes aglow; as well as the Dānavas of
1872,SECTION XXI.,"terrific energy, and the dwellers of the nether spheres. And billows of"
1873,SECTION XXI.,"the sovran Ocean, resembling Vindhya or Mandara, containing crocodiles"
1874,SECTION XXI.,and Makaras sprang up by thousands. And Varuna’s abode had its surges
1875,SECTION XXI.,"whirling, its serpents and Rākshasas seized with affright, and its"
1876,SECTION XXI.,ferocious aquatic animals borne all around; and it sent forth sounds.
1877,SECTION XXI.,"Then Sumitrā’s son, springing up, said unto Rāghava of fiery vehemence,"

1941,SECTION XXII.,"vesture, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, bearing on his head a"
1942,SECTION XXII.,noble garland containing all flowers; decked with ornaments of polished
1943,SECTION XXII.,"gold; as well with excellent ornaments of gems originating in himself,"
1944,SECTION XXII.,like the mountain Himavān embellished with metals (sprung in
1945,SECTION XXII.,"himself),—(the Ocean arose) with wave on wave whirling around, and rife"
1946,SECTION XXII.,"with winds blowing among clouds,—surrounded by streams, Ganga, Sindhu"
1947,SECTION XXII.,"(and others). And approaching the arrow-showering Rāma, and greeting him"
1948,SECTION XXII.,"fair, Ocean spoke unto him with joined hands,—""O Rāghava, earth, air,"
1949,SECTION XXII.,"sky, water and light,—these, O mild one, retaining their eternal course,"
1950,SECTION XXII.,maintain their (respective) natures. Mine also is that nature whereby I
1951,SECTION XXII.,am fathomless and incapable of being crossed. The reverse of this is the
1952,SECTION XXII.,having a bottom. And for this reason I speak to thee (concerning the
1953,SECTION XXII.,"means). O king’s son, not from desire, or covetuousness, or fear, or"
1954,SECTION XXII.,"anger, can I anywise deprive my waters abounding in alligators of their"
1955,SECTION XXII.,(perpetual) motion. I will tell thee how thou wilt pass (over me); and I
1956,SECTION XXII.,will bear it. And no ferocious aquatic animals shall do wrong so long as
1957,SECTION XXII.,"thy forces have not crossed. And, O Rāma, I will make as it were firm"
1958,SECTION XXII.,"land for the crossing over of the monkeys"". Then Rāma said,—""O Varuna’s"
1959,SECTION XXII.,"abode, listen to me! This arrow (of mine) must accomplish the end"
1960,SECTION XXII.,"(intended). Where shall I let it light?"" Hearing Rāma’s speech, and"
1961,SECTION XXII.,"looking at the mighty arrow, that exceedingly energetic one, the great"
1962,SECTION XXII.,"Deep, addressed Rāghava, saying,—""There is a certain spot of mine in the"
1963,SECTION XXII.,"North, which is more sacred (than the rest). It is famed as Drumakulya,"
1964,SECTION XXII.,even as thou art famed in the world. There are there many robbers of
1965,SECTION XXII.,"ferocious forms and actions,—wicked wights, headed by cow-herds,—who"
1966,SECTION XXII.,"drink of my water. These persons of unrighteous acts touch me, and I"
1967,SECTION XXII.,"cannot bear this sin. O Rāma, do thou at that place render this best of"
1968,SECTION XXII.,"arrows successful"". Hearing the words of the high-souled Ocean, (Rāma)"
1969,SECTION XXII.,"immediately after,⁵⁹ let fly that flaming shaft. And the place where the"
1970,SECTION XXII.,"arrow resembling the thunder-bolt and _vajra_ in splendour, alighted,"
1971,SECTION XXII.,"hath been celebrated on earth as Marukāntāra. And hurt with the dart,"
1972,SECTION XXII.,"the Earth emitted roars; and in consequence of this, water began to gush"
1973,SECTION XXII.,out at the mouth of the wound from the subterranean regions. And this
1974,SECTION XXII.,then became well-known as Vrana; and there are seen the waters of the
1975,SECTION XXII.,Ocean spring up. And there arose a terrific report of riving. And owing
1976,SECTION XXII.,"to this,⁶⁰ as well as the incident of the arrow, the water that existed"
1977,SECTION XXII.,"in the tanks, was dried up. Having dried up Marukāntāra famous"
1978,SECTION XXII.,"throughout the three regions, as well as the reservoirs of water, Rāma"
1979,SECTION XXII.,"the son of Daçaratha, learned and of god-like prowess, conferred a boon"
1980,SECTION XXII.,"on the desert, saying,—""This place shall be filled with food nourishing"
1981,SECTION XXII.,beasts; and ailments shall be rare here. And the fruits and roots shall
1982,SECTION XXII.,be replete with relish; and it shall abound in oil and overflow with
1983,SECTION XXII.,"milk; and it shall contain various odorous drugs"". Thus did the desert"
1984,SECTION XXII.,"come to possess these attributes; and from Rāma’s bestowal of a boon, it"
1985,SECTION XXII.,"attained a pleasant aspect. On that place being burnt up, that lord of"
1986,SECTION XXII.,"streams, the Ocean, thus spake unto Rāghava, versed in every branch of"
1987,SECTION XXII.,"learning,—""O mild one, this one is named Nala, son unto Viçwakarmā. He"
1988,SECTION XXII.,hath received a boon from his sire. Viçwakarmā’s son is well pleased
1989,SECTION XXII.,"with thee. Let this monkey, surcharged with exhuberant spirits, build a"
1990,SECTION XXII.,"bridge over me. I will hold that up. This one is as his sire"". Having"
1991,SECTION XXII.,"delivered himself thus, Ocean disappeared. Then that foremost of"
1992,SECTION XXII.,"monkeys, Nala, arising, spoke unto the mighty Rāma,—""Resorting to my"
1993,SECTION XXII.,"sire’s skill, I will build a bridge over the spacious abode of Makaras."
1994,SECTION XXII.,The mighty Ocean hath spoken justly. In respect of the ingrate even
1995,SECTION XXII.,"chastisement is supreme in this world,—this is my conviction. Down with"
1996,SECTION XXII.,"forbearance, or moderation, or gift! This dreadful Ocean, this mighty"
1997,SECTION XXII.,"deep, expecting to see a bridge (thrown over him), hath granted depth"
1998,SECTION XXII.,"unto Rāghava.—(Formerly) is Mandara, Viçwakarmā had conferred a boon on"
1999,SECTION XXII.,"my mother: ’O exalted one, thy son shall be like me.’ I am a son of his,"
2000,SECTION XXII.,"sprung from his loins, and I am like unto Viçwakarmā. Not having been"
2001,SECTION XXII.,"asked by thee, I had not unfolded my qualifications. I also am capable"
2002,SECTION XXII.,of constructing a bridge over Varuna’s abode. Therefore this very day
2003,SECTION XXII.,"let the foremost monkeys construct the bridge"". Then directed by Rāma,"
2004,SECTION XXII.,the principal monkeys with alacrity entered the mighty forest in
2005,SECTION XXII.,"hundrerds and thousands. And themselves resembling mountains, the"
2006,SECTION XXII.,foremost of the monkeys began to break down and draw them towards the
2007,SECTION XXII.,"Ocean. And the monkeys filled the Ocean with _sālas_, and _açwakarnas_,"
2008,SECTION XXII.,"_dhavas_, bamboos _kutajas_, _arjunas_, palms, _tilakas_, _tiniças_,"
2009,SECTION XXII.,"_billakas_, _aparnas_, and blossoming _karnikāras_, mangoes, and a"
2010,SECTION XXII.,trees. And those monkeys—the foremost of their species—began to gather
2011,SECTION XXII.,"the trees, some with their roots, some without them,—carrying them like"
2012,SECTION XXII.,Indra’s ensign. And those huge-bodied monkeys possessed of prodigious
2013,SECTION XXII.,"strength, procured palms and pomegranates, cocoanuts and itakas,"
2014,SECTION XXII.,"Kariras, Vakulas, and Nimbas,—as well as rocks. Measuring elephants’"
2015,SECTION XXII.,"dimensions; and uprooting crags, they tossed them by means of machines."
2016,SECTION XXII.,"And on rocks being plunged into the waters, the latter, suddenly"
2017,SECTION XXII.,"swelling up, mounted to the welkin, and again subsided.—And (the trees)"
2018,SECTION XXII.,"dropping (into the deep), vexed it all around. And some made lines (for"
2019,SECTION XXII.,insuring straightness unto the bridge). And in the middle of the lord of
2020,SECTION XXII.,"rivers and streams, Nala made a grand bridge measuring an hundred"
2021,SECTION XXII.,_yojanas_. And then he went about constructing the bridge with the
2022,SECTION XXII.,assistance of monkeys of dreadful deeds. And some took the measuring and
2023,SECTION XXII.,others bore (timber to the sea). And by help of hundreds of monkeys
2024,SECTION XXII.,"following Rāma’s mandate, hued like woods or mountains, (they)"
2025,SECTION XXII.,"constructed a bridge with grass, and wood. And the monkeys made the"
2026,SECTION XXII.,bridge of trees with blossoming tops. And (monkeys) resembling Dānavas
2027,SECTION XXII.,"were rushing all around with rocks resembling hills, and"
2028,SECTION XXII.,mountain-summits. And tremendous was the tumult that came of crags
2029,SECTION XXII.,thrown and rocks toppled down into the mighty deep. And on the first day
2030,SECTION XXII.,"the elephant-like monkeys of spirits and exerting themselves vigorously,"
2031,SECTION XXII.,finished fifteen _yojanas_. And the exceedingly strong and huge-bodied
2032,SECTION XXII.,monkeys on the second day speedily disposed of twenty _yojanas_. And on
2033,SECTION XXII.,the third day the huge-bodied active monkeys did one and twenty
2034,SECTION XXII.,_yojanas_ on the sea. And on the fourth day the exceedingly impetuous
2035,SECTION XXII.,"monkeys, bestirring themselves vigorously, did two and twenty _yojanas_."
2036,SECTION XXII.,And On the fifth day the fast-speeding monkeys accomplished three and
2037,SECTION XXII.,"twenty _yojanas_ reaching unto the fair shore. And resembling his sire,"
2038,SECTION XXII.,"that best of monkeys, the lusty and graceful offspring of Viçwakarmā,"
2039,SECTION XXII.,(thus) constructed the bridge over the sea. And that bridge built by
2040,SECTION XXII.,"force over the abode of _makaras_, looked graceful and splendid like the"
2041,SECTION XXII.,"Milky way in the firmament. And then the deities and Gandharbas, the"
2042,SECTION XXII.,"Siddhas and the prime saints, appearing in the heavens, stood there,"
2043,SECTION XXII.,eager to behold this wonder. And the gods and Gandharbas saw that bridge
2044,SECTION XXII.,"of Nala, difficult of being made, having an area of ten _yojanas_ and"
2045,SECTION XXII.,"measuring an hundred in length. And the monkeys, leaping and bounding"
2046,SECTION XXII.,"and roaring, as well as all creatures, beheld that building of the"
2047,SECTION XXII.,"bridge on the ocean, inconceivable, and marvellous, displaying skill"
2048,SECTION XXII.,past thought and capable of making one’s hair stand on end. And those
2049,SECTION XXII.,"thousands of Kotis of exceeding vigor, having constructed the bridge"
2050,SECTION XXII.,"over the ocean, went over to the other shore of the mighty main. And"
2051,SECTION XXII.,"spacious, skillfully constructed, graceful, well-paved and nicely"
2052,SECTION XXII.,"finished, the great bridge appeared like the line where the hair hath"
2053,SECTION XXII.,"been parted on the Ocean’s head. Then on the other shore of the ocean,"
2054,SECTION XXII.,"Bibhishana, with the view of opposing foes (that might advance),"
2055,SECTION XXII.,"stationed himself mace in hand, along with some councilors. Then Sugriva"
2056,SECTION XXII.,"spoke unto Rāma, having truth for his prowess,—""Do thou get upon"
2057,SECTION XXII.,"Hanumān, and let Laskhmana get upon Angada. O hero, vast is this"
2058,SECTION XXII.,"Ocean—abode of Makaras. These monkeys, rangers of the sky, shall hold"
2059,SECTION XXII.,"you up both"". Thereat the graceful and righteous Rāma along with"
2060,SECTION XXII.,"Lakshmana, equipped with his bow, set out in the van of the army in"
2061,SECTION XXII.,"company with Sugriva. And some monkeys proceeded along the middle, and"
2062,SECTION XXII.,"some plunged into the deep, and some went by the road. And some coursed"
2063,SECTION XXII.,"through the air, bounding up bird-like. And that dreadful array of"
2064,SECTION XXII.,"monkeys crossing over, with its mighty uproar drowned the dreadful roar"
2065,SECTION XXII.,"of the deep, which had been arising. On the monkey-host having crossed"
2066,SECTION XXII.,"by the bridge of Nala, the king stationed it on the shore abounding in"
2067,SECTION XXII.,"fruits, roots and water. Beholding that work of Rāghava incapable of"
2068,SECTION XXII.,"being performed, the deities together with the Siddhas and Charanas, and"
2069,SECTION XXII.,"the Maharshis, suddenly presenting themselves before Rāma, sprinkled him"
2070,SECTION XXII.,"one by one with sacred water, and said,—""Mayst thou be victorious, O"
2071,SECTION XXII.,"human-divine one! Rule thou the Earth eternally!"" Thus in various"
2072,SECTION XXII.,"auspicious words, did they pay homage unto that one honored by the"
2073,SECTION XXII.,"Brahmanas, Rāma."

2099,SECTION XXIII.,"darkly, and the Earth shaketh. The tops of the mountains tremble, and"
2100,SECTION XXIII.,"trees topple down. And the clouds are ashen and roistering, and roar"
2101,SECTION XXIII.,"roughly. And lowering, they shower portentous drops of blood. And the"
2102,SECTION XXIII.,twilight is terrible and looketh like the red sandal. And a fiery circle
2103,SECTION XXIII.,"droppeth from the flaming sun. And on all sides birds and beasts,"
2104,SECTION XXIII.,"distressed, uttering woe-begone notes, and grim-visaged, set up crying"
2105,SECTION XXIII.,"against the sun, arousing great fear. And the Moon, although not"
2106,SECTION XXIII.,"appearing⁶¹ in the night, burneth, and with dark and red rays riseth, as"
2107,SECTION XXIII.,if it intended to exterminate people. And the aspect (of the sun) is
2108,SECTION XXIII.,"slight, rough, and not good;⁶² and, O Lakshmana, a blue mark is visible"
2109,SECTION XXIII.,on the unclouded Sun. And the stars seem erased by a mighty volume of
2110,SECTION XXIII.,"dust. O Lakshmana, behold this sight disastrous to people like unto the"
2111,SECTION XXIII.,"universal dissolution. Crows, and hawks, and the inferior vultures,"
2112,SECTION XXIII.,"wheel all round. And jackals are sending inauspicious yells, exciting"
2113,SECTION XXIII.,"great fear. The earth shall be covered with darts and javelins, and"
2114,SECTION XXIII.,"swords discharged by monkeys and Rākshasas, and then turned into mire"

2117,SECTION XXIII.,"incapable of being subdued. Having said this, that subduer in conflict,"
2118,SECTION XXIII.,"that lord, the enchanter of men, Rāma,⁶³ equipped with his bow, proceeds"
2119,SECTION XXIII.,in the direction of Lankā. And all the principal monkeys— Sugriva with
2120,SECTION XXIII.,"Bibhishana—went on, setting up roars, for the destruction of foes, who"
2121,SECTION XXIII.,were determined to battle with them. And consequently Raghu’s son was

2143,SECTION XXIV.,"forest heard a hubbub in Lankā, as well as the sounds of trumpets and"
2144,SECTION XXIV.,"Mridangas, mighty and capable of making people’s down stand on end. And"

2147,SECTION XXIV.,"And the Rākshasas also heard the roars of the monkeys, resembling the"
2148,SECTION XXIV.,rumbling of haughty clouds in the sky. Beholding Lankā with variegated
2149,SECTION XXIV.,"standards, and streamers, Daçaratha’s son went⁶⁵ to Sitā with an"
2150,SECTION XXIV.,"aggrieved heart. ""Here that one having eyes resembling those of a young"

2155,SECTION XXIV.,"and, built by Viçwakarmā on the brow of the mountain, she seems to have"
2156,SECTION XXIV.,been made by the Mind. Constructed in time past with edifices thronging
2157,SECTION XXIV.,"her, Lankā looks like the all-encasing air, covered with pale clouds."
2158,SECTION XXIV.,"Lankā is embellished with groves resembling Chitraratha, fair, and"
2159,SECTION XXIV.,"eloquent with the notes of various birds, and fraught with fruits and"
2160,SECTION XXIV.,"flowers. Behold the intoxicated birds, and the black bees blending (with"
2161,SECTION XXIV.,the blossoms). And the blessed breeze swayeth the trees vocal with the
2162,SECTION XXIV.,"coels"". Having divided his forces there agreeably to the directions of"
2163,SECTION XXIV.,"the scriptures, Daçaratha’s son, Rāma, thus spoke unto Lakshmana. And he"
2164,SECTION XXIV.,"ordered that monkey-army, saying,—""Taking his own forces, let the"
2165,SECTION XXIV.,"puissant and invincible Angada along with Nila, station himself in the"
2166,SECTION XXIV.,"centre of the forces. And let the monkey, named Rishabha, surrounded by"
2167,SECTION XXIV.,"numbers of monkeys, post himself at the right of the monkey-army. And"
2168,SECTION XXIV.,"let the active and irrepressible Gandhamādana, resembling an elephant"
2169,SECTION XXIV.,"fragrant with the temporal exudation, stay, occupying the left of the"
2170,SECTION XXIV.,"forces. I myself along with Lakshmana, shall needfully stay in the"
2171,SECTION XXIV.,"fore-front. And the monkeys, Jāmbavān, Sushena and Vagadarçi, the three"
2172,SECTION XXIV.,"high-souled, foremost bears,⁶⁷—shall protect the interior (of the"
2173,SECTION XXIV.,"forces). And as the Sun, surcharged with energy, protects the hind half"
2174,SECTION XXIV.,"of the globe, let the monkey-monarch protect the rear of the"
2175,SECTION XXIV.,"monkey-army"". And that army being skilfully divided into parts and"
2176,SECTION XXIV.,"protected by great monkeys, resembled the welkin covered with clouds."
2177,SECTION XXIV.,"Then, taking up mountain-peaks and mighty trees, the monkeys began to"
2178,SECTION XXIV.,"proceed towards Lankā burning to crush Lankā in battle. ""We shall"
2179,SECTION XXIV.,"demolish Lankā by hurling mountain-peaks, or with our clenched fists""."
2180,SECTION XXIV.,Thus did the foremost of monkeys think in their minds. Then the
2181,SECTION XXIV.,"exceedingly energetic Rāma addressed Sugriva, saying,—""Our forces have"

2183,SECTION XXIV.,"lord of monkeys possessed of great strength, liberated the envoy, Suka,"
2184,SECTION XXIV.,"at the command of Rāma. Liberated at the word of Rāma, Suka, who had"
2185,SECTION XXIV.,"been sore tormented by the monkeys, oppressed with exceeding great fear,"
2186,SECTION XXIV.,"went to the lord of Rākshasas. Thereat, Rāvana, laughing, said unto"
2187,SECTION XXIV.,"Suka,—""Are thy wings fettered? And thou seemst as if thy wings had been"
2188,SECTION XXIV.,severed. Why? Didst thou come under the control of the volatile
2189,SECTION XXIV.,"(monkeys)?"" Thereat, exercised with fear, Suka, commanded by the"
2190,SECTION XXIV.,"monarch, answered the lord of Rākshasas in this excellent speech,"
2191,SECTION XXIV.,"saying,—""Repairing to the northern shore of the sea, I, pacifying (the"
2192,SECTION XXIV.,"monkeys) with mild speech, communicated thy tidings clearly (unto"
2193,SECTION XXIV.,"Sugriva). Thereat, as soon as they saw me, the monkeys flying into a"
2194,SECTION XXIV.,"wrath, captured me, and attempted to clip my wings and slay me with"
2195,SECTION XXIV.,their clenched fists. They are insuseptible of being spoken to. No doubt
2196,SECTION XXIV.,"whatever can exist that, O lord of Rākshasas, the monkeys are by nature"
2197,SECTION XXIV.,wrathful and fierce. The same Rāma that hath slain Virādha and Kavandha
2198,SECTION XXIV.,"and Khara, hath arrived (here) along with Sugriva, searching for the"
2199,SECTION XXIV.,whereabouts of Sitā. Having thrown a bridge across the brine and crossed
2200,SECTION XXIV.,"the salt sea, Rāghava, equipped with his bow, stayeth here, setting the"
2201,SECTION XXIV.,Rakshas at naught. And the hosts consisting of thousands of bears and
2202,SECTION XXIV.,"monkeys, resembling hills and clouds, envelope the Earth. And peace"
2203,SECTION XXIV.,there can be none between the forces of the Rākshasas and the hosts of
2204,SECTION XXIV.,"the sovereign of monkeys, like unto the deities and the Dānavas. And"
2205,SECTION XXIV.,they advance before the wall. Speedily do one of these things—make over
2206,SECTION XXIV.,"Sitā without delay, or give (him) battle"". Hearing Suka’s speech, Rāvana"
2207,SECTION XXIV.,"with his eyes reddened in wrath, spoke, as if burning (Suka) with"
2208,SECTION XXIV.,"them,—""Even if gods, and Gandharbas, and Dānavas should array themselves"
2209,SECTION XXIV.,"against me, I will not from fear of all creatures, render (back) Sitā."
2210,SECTION XXIV.,"When shall my shafts pursue Rāghava, like maddened Bhramaras making"
2211,SECTION XXIV.,towards blossomy trees in spring? When by means of flaming shafts shot
2212,SECTION XXIV.,"from my bow shall I burn (Rāghava) with his body bathed in blood, even"
2213,SECTION XXIV.,"as a meteor (burneth) an elephant? And when, surrounded by a mighty"
2214,SECTION XXIV.,"host, shall I confound his ranks, even as the Sun arising, (vanquisheth)"
2215,SECTION XXIV.,"the light of the stellar spheres? My impetuosity like the Ocean’s, my"
2216,SECTION XXIV.,"strength like the Wind’s, Dāçarathi doth not know,—and therefore it is"
2217,SECTION XXIV.,that he desireth to fight with me. Rāma hath not seen my shafts resting
2218,SECTION XXIV.,"in the quiver, resembling venomous serpents,—and therefore it is that he"
2219,SECTION XXIV.,seeketh to fight with me. Rāghava hath not in conflict formerly known my
2220,SECTION XXIV.,bow representing my Vinā sounded with my shafts; having tremendous
2221,SECTION XXIV.,sounds proceeding from the strings; dreadful; with the cries of
2222,SECTION XXIV.,distressed people for its mighty strains of music; and resonant with the
2223,SECTION XXIV.,"reports of Nārāchas and palms. And, having bathed in the great field of"
2224,SECTION XXIV.,"battle representing the river of hostile forces, I will in the encounter"
2225,SECTION XXIV.,"strike (this Vinā). Neither the thousand-eyed Vasava, nor Varuna"

2251,SECTION XXV.,"behoveth you to ascertain the magnitude thereof, its strength, who are"
2252,SECTION XXV.,"the foremost monkeys, who are the councilors assembled there of Rāma,"
2253,SECTION XXV.,"and who of Sugriva, who range at the head, who among the monkeys are"
2254,SECTION XXV.,heroic; how they have constructed the bridge over the water of the
2255,SECTION XXV.,"ocean; how the high-souled monkeys stay there; Rāma’s, as well as"
2256,SECTION XXV.,"Lakshmana’s purpose, prowess and the arms (they fight with). And who is"
2257,SECTION XXV.,the commander of those magnanimous monkeys? Having learnt all this
2258,SECTION XXV.,"truly, ye ought to return speedily"". Being thus commissioned, these"
2259,SECTION XXV.,"heroes, the Rākshasas, Suka and Sārana, assuming monkey-shapes, entered"
2260,SECTION XXV.,into the hosts of monkeys. But Suka and Sārana could not number that
2261,SECTION XXV.,"army of monkeys, incomprehensible and capable of making people’s hair"
2262,SECTION XXV.,"stand on end. The forces were on mountain-tops, by fountains and in"
2263,SECTION XXV.,"caves. And those rangers of the night beheld those forces, some having"
2264,SECTION XXV.,"already crossed, and some crossing, and some intent on doing so; and"
2265,SECTION XXV.,some having sat down and some sitting—that mighty army sending terrific
2266,SECTION XXV.,"roars,—that ocean of hosts incapable of being disturbed. As they"
2267,SECTION XXV.,"remained thus disguised, they were discovered by Vibhishana. Thereat,"
2268,SECTION XXV.,"taking them captive, he unfolded (the fact) unto Rāma, saying,—""These"
2269,SECTION XXV.,are the counsellors of the lord of Rākshasas—Suka and Sārana. O captor
2270,SECTION XXV.,"of hostile capitals, they have come as spies from Lankā"". Seeing Rāma,"
2271,SECTION XXV.,"they were greatly afflicted, and, despairing of their lives and"
2272,SECTION XXV.,"exercised with fear, with joined hands, said,—""O placid one, commanded"
2273,SECTION XXV.,"by Rāvana, we have come here, O son of Raghu, for the purpose of"
2274,SECTION XXV.,"gathering information concerning this army"". Hearing their speech,"
2275,SECTION XXV.,"Rāma—son unto Daçaratha—ever engaged in the welfare of all beings,"
2276,SECTION XXV.,"laughing, remarked,—""If you have heedfully noted this entire array, or"
2277,SECTION XXV.,"if you have done what ye had been commanded to do, return in peace. If"
2278,SECTION XXV.,"aught remaineth unseen, do ye see it anew. Or Vibhishana will again"
2279,SECTION XXV.,"fully show it unto you. Having been taken, ye need not fear on the score"
2280,SECTION XXV.,of your lives. Even if envoys happen to be taken who are equipped with
2281,SECTION XXV.,"weapons, they should not be slain. And albeit these night-rangers have"
2282,SECTION XXV.,"come as spies in disguise, with the view of creating division among"
2283,SECTION XXV.,"their foes, yet, O Vibhishana, let them off. Entering the extensive"
2284,SECTION XXV.,"Lankā, ye should say unto the king—younger brother unto the Dispenser of"
2285,SECTION XXV.,"riches—the words which I utter,—’That force relying on which thou hast"
2286,SECTION XXV.,"carried away my Sitā, do thou as thou wishest, along with thy forces and"
2287,SECTION XXV.,"friends, display the same. On the morning of the morrow behold the city"
2288,SECTION XXV.,"of Lankā with her wall and gates, as well as the hosts of Rākshasas,"
2289,SECTION XXV.,destroyed by me with my shafts. And as Vasava equipped with the
2290,SECTION XXV.,"thunder-bolt hurleth the same amidst the Dānavas, will I, O Rāvana, on"
2291,SECTION XXV.,the morning of the morrow pour down my dreadful ire upon thee along with
2292,SECTION XXV.,"thy forces.’"" Thus directed (by Rāma), those Rākshasas, Suka and Sārana,"
2293,SECTION XXV.,"having saluted the righteous Rāghava with ’Victory!,’ came (back) to"
2294,SECTION XXV.,"Lankā and spoke unto the lord of Rākshasas, saying,—""O lord of"
2295,SECTION XXV.,"Rākshasas, having been taken by Vibhishana for the purpose of being"
2296,SECTION XXV.,"slain, we came to be seen by the righteoua-souled Rāma of immeasurable"
2297,SECTION XXV.,"energy, and (finally) were liberated (by him). As these four persons"
2298,SECTION XXV.,"have combined—like unto the Lokapalas, heroic, accomplished in arms, and"
2299,SECTION XXV.,"of steady prowess—viz., Daçaratha’s son, Rāma, the graceful Lakshmana,"
2300,SECTION XXV.,"Vibhishana, and the highly powerful Sugriva, resembling the great Indra,"
2301,SECTION XXV.,these are capable of uprooting the city of Lankā—walls and gateways—and
2302,SECTION XXV.,"replacing her (on her former site),—leave thou the monkeys aside. Such"
2303,SECTION XXV.,"is Rāma’s figure and arms that he shall alone demolish Lankā,—leave the"
2304,SECTION XXV.,"other three alone. And that host protected by Rāma, Lakshmana and"
2305,SECTION XXV.,"Sugriva, shall become exceedingly hard to combat even by the Asuras and"
2306,SECTION XXV.,"gods.—And the army of the high-souled rangers of the woods, eager for"
2307,SECTION XXV.,"encounter, contains warriors bursting with high spirits. No use of"
2308,SECTION XXV.,dispute. Be thou intent on pacification. Do thou render back Maithili
2309,SECTION XXV.,"unto Daçaratha’s son""."

2319,SECTION XXXI.,"thou, having been hard handled by the monkeys and distressed in"

2321,SECTION XXXI.,day. What foe of mine is there who is competent to conquer me in

2323,SECTION XXXI.,"the Rākshasas—desirous of surveying (the monkey-hosts), ascended an"
2324,SECTION XXXI.,"edifice white like snow, and elevated like many palms (placed one upon"

2326,SECTION XXXI.,"spies, saw the sea, mountains and forests. And they beheld the Earth"
2327,SECTION XXXI.,"enveloped with monkeys, and the mighty host of monkeys, boundless and"
2328,SECTION XXXI.,"irresistible. And having seen this, king Rāvana asked Sārana,—""Who among"
2329,SECTION XXXI.,"these monkeys are the foremost, who are the heroes, and who possessed of"
2330,SECTION XXXI.,"great strength? Who, bursting with spirits, stay all about the fore?"
2331,SECTION XXXI.,Whom doth Sugriva listen to? And who are the leaders of the
2332,SECTION XXXI.,"monkey-leaders? O Sārana, relate thou all this unto me. And what is the"
2333,SECTION XXXI.,"prowess of the monkeys?"" Thereat, Sārana, knowing the chiefs (of the"
2334,SECTION XXXI.,"monkey-army), spoke unto the sovereign of Rākshasas, who had asked"
2335,SECTION XXXI.,"(him), as to who were the heads of the rangers of the woods. ""This"
2336,SECTION XXXI.,"monkey, that, setting up roars, stayeth in front of Lankā, surrounded by"
2337,SECTION XXXI.,"hundreds and thousands of monkey-leaders, by whose tremendous shouts"
2338,SECTION XXXI.,"Lankā trembleth with her wall, gateways, hills, woods and forests, and"
2339,SECTION XXXI.,who is posted in front of the forces of the high-souled Sugriva—master
2340,SECTION XXXI.,of all the monkeys—is the heroic leader of monkey-bands named Nila. And
2341,SECTION XXXI.,"that one, possessed of prowess, who, folding up his arms, paceth the"
2342,SECTION XXXI.,"gound on foot, who, facing Lankā, from wrath is frequently yawning, who"
2343,SECTION XXXI.,"resembles a mountain-peak and is like the filaments of a lotus, who,"
2344,SECTION XXXI.,"enraged again and again soundeth his tail, and the ten cardinal points"
2345,SECTION XXXI.,"resound with the sounds of whose tail,—is he who hath been sprinkled by"
2346,SECTION XXXI.,"Sugriva—king of monkeys—the heir apparent, named Angada. He challengeth"
2347,SECTION XXXI.,"thee to the fight. The worthy son of Vāli and ever dear unto Sugriva, he"

2349,SECTION XXXI.,"well-wisher of Rāghava, the vehement Hanumān, hath seen Janaka’s"
2350,SECTION XXXI.,"daughter, was owing to the advice of this one. That powerful (hero) is"
2351,SECTION XXXI.,"proceeding, taking innumerable bands belonging to the lord of monkeys,"
2352,SECTION XXXI.,for the purpose of beating thee by means of his soldiery. Following
2353,SECTION XXXI.,"Vāli’s son, and surrounded by a mighty force, stayeth in the field the"

2355,SECTION XXXI.,"lying inactive, and setting up roars and ululations, are following this"
2356,SECTION XXXI.,"one,⁶⁸ are heroes dwelling in _Chandana_.⁶⁹ With his own army alone, the"
2357,SECTION XXXI.,silver-hued Sweta of dreadful prowess hopes to subdue Lankā. Marshalling
2358,SECTION XXXI.,"his monkey-forces and cheering up his soldiers, that intelligent monkey,"
2359,SECTION XXXI.,"famed over the three regions, having speedily met with Sugriva, is"
2360,SECTION XXXI.,retracing his steps. From days of yore on the banks of the Gomati there
2361,SECTION XXXI.,"is a mountain, (named) Ramya, (otherwise) called Sanrochana. The mount"
2362,SECTION XXXI.,"abounds with various trees. There that leader of bands, named Kumuda,"

2364,SECTION XXXI.,"and thousands of monkeys, and the long grim hairs of whose tail,"
2365,SECTION XXXI.,"coppery, yellow, sable and white, are cast about, is the energetic"

2368,SECTION XXXI.,"furnished with a long mane, who, remaining apart, vieweth all Lankā as"
2369,SECTION XXXI.,"if consuming her with his eyes, dwelleth for ever and a day in Vindhya,"

2378,SECTION XXXI.,"with fear cast off,—resideth in the romantic mount, Sālweya, and, a"
2379,SECTION XXXI.,"leader of companies, is named Sarabha. To him, O king, belong forty"

2688,SECTION XXX.,"ordered by him, then (Sārdula), bewildered by fear, addressed that tiger"
2689,SECTION XXX.,"of a Rākshasa, saying,—""Those powerful monkeys, O king, puissant,"
2690,SECTION XXX.,"strong, and protected by Rāghava, are incapable of being ranged (by us)."
2691,SECTION XXX.,"And they cannot be conversed with or interrogated. All around, the"
2692,SECTION XXX.,"courses are kept by monkeys resembling hills. As soon as I entered, and"
2693,SECTION XXX.,"was scanning that host, I was discovered. And forcibly taken by the"
2694,SECTION XXX.,"Rakshas, I was pulled by them hither and thither. And furiously assailed"
2695,SECTION XXX.,"by the monkeys with thighs, clenched fists, teeth, and palms, I was"
2696,SECTION XXX.,"dragged in the midst of the army by the enraged monkeys. And, after"
2697,SECTION XXX.,"having been taken all about, I was (at length) taken before Rāma,"
2698,SECTION XXX.,"bleeding, with my limbs showing sorry work, and my senses swimming and"
2699,SECTION XXX.,"paralysed. And, having been belabored by the monkeys, I, on craving his"
2700,SECTION XXX.,"kindness with joined hands, was, at his pleasure, rescued by Rāghava,"
2701,SECTION XXX.,"with, ""Don’t, don’t""! Having filled up the deep with rocks and crags,"

2707,SECTION XXX.,"Hearing this, Rāvana, lord of Rākshasas, then reflecting in his mind,"

2709,SECTION XXX.,"and Dānavas should array themselves against me, Sitā I shall not give,"
2710,SECTION XXX.,"from fear of all creatures"". Having said this, that exceedingly"
2711,SECTION XXX.,"energetic one again said,—""Thou hast ranged this army. Who here among"

2713,SECTION XXX.,"what are those monkeys that are hard to approach, like? And, O thou of"

2715,SECTION XXX.,"me). Having ascertained their strength and weakness, I shall in this"
2716,SECTION XXX.,"matter adopt my course. Those who wish for fight, certainly take account"
2717,SECTION XXX.,"of all this"". Thus addressed by Rāvana, Sārdula—best of spies—thus begin"
2718,SECTION XXX.,"to speak in the presence of Rāvana,—""O king, that unconquerable one in"
2719,SECTION XXX.,"fight, Jāmbavān, is well known as the son Gadgada, king of bears. The"
2720,SECTION XXX.,"other son of Gadgada is the son of Sakra’s preceptor. By which son,"

2726,SECTION XXX.,the son of the bearer of sacrificial oblations;⁸⁵ and Hanumān is famed
2727,SECTION XXX.,as the son of the Wind-god. And the irrepressible and youthful Angada is
2728,SECTION XXX.,the grandson of Sakra. And the lusty Mainda and Dwivida are sprung from
2729,SECTION XXX.,"Açwi. And five are the sons of Vaivaswata, resembling the Reaper"

2810,SECTION XXXI.,"Bibhishana, who was flying at his will, was taken captive. And Lakshmana"

2862,SECTION XXXII.,"the race; and the entire race is exterminated by thee, partial to"
2863,SECTION XXXII.,dissension. And what evil had been done unto Kaikeyi by the revered
2864,SECTION XXXII.,"Rāma, that along with me, he hadst been banished into the woods, with"
2865,SECTION XXXII.,"rags given him (for his covering)?"" Having said this, Vaidehi, forlorn"
2866,SECTION XXXII.,"and trembling (all over), dropped to the earth, like a plantain cut off."
2867,SECTION XXXII.,"Then, recovering after a while, and having regained her consciousness,"
2868,SECTION XXXII.,"the large-eyed one, placing the head in her front, gave way to grief."
2869,SECTION XXXII.,"""Ah! I am undone, O mighty-armed one! O thou that didst follow stern"
2870,SECTION XXXII.,"vows! From thy (death), I have come by this final plight, having been"
2871,SECTION XXXII.,"rendered a widow. The greatest calamity (that can befall a woman), is"
2872,SECTION XXXII.,"said to be the death of her husband. And, possessor of an excellent"
2873,SECTION XXXII.,"character, thou hast departed before me, who have ever trod the path of"
2874,SECTION XXXII.,the righteous; but who have come by a mighty grief and am plunged in a
2875,SECTION XXXII.,"sea of sorrow. And thou, who was engaged in delivering me, hast thyself"
2876,SECTION XXXII.,"fallen! And my mother-in-law, Kauçalyā, attached (to thee), through the"
2877,SECTION XXXII.,"death of thee, her son, at the hands of Rākshasas, hath been reduced to"
2878,SECTION XXXII.,"the condition of a cow that hath been deprived of her calf. O Rāghava,"
2879,SECTION XXXII.,even the astrologers had predicted long life for thee. But their words
2880,SECTION XXXII.,"are false,—thou, O Rāghava, wast short-lived. Or didst thy wisdom, wise"
2881,SECTION XXXII.,"and good as thou wert, come to naught? For God, who is the origin of all"
2882,SECTION XXXII.,"beings, maketh (every one) reap the fruit of his own acts. And why,"
2883,SECTION XXXII.,"versed in polity as thou wast, didst thou come by death, unforeseen?"
2884,SECTION XXXII.,"Thou wast acquainted with the means of warding off misfortune, and"
2885,SECTION XXXII.,"skilled in doing so. And having been brought hither by me, representing"
2886,SECTION XXXII.,"the Fatal Night, fierce and fell,—after (being) embraced, and by"
2887,SECTION XXXII.,"force,—the lotus-eyed one hath met with his death. Here liest thou, O"
2888,SECTION XXXII.,"long-armed one, leaving me lone,—and embracing the Earth like thy"
2889,SECTION XXXII.,"beloved fair. Ever carefully worshipped with perfumed wreaths, this bow"
2890,SECTION XXXII.,"of thine, O hero, embellished with gold, is dear unto me. O sinless one,"
2891,SECTION XXXII.,"thou hast surely gone to heaven, and (art there) in the company of thy"
2892,SECTION XXXII.,"sire and my father-in-law, Daçaratha, and all thy ancestors. Thou hast"
2893,SECTION XXXII.,become a star of the firmament as the fruit of thy great act.⁸⁸ Thou
2894,SECTION XXXII.,"hast disregarded thy righteous race of Rājarshis. O king, why dost thou"
2895,SECTION XXXII.,"not look at me? And why is it that thou dost not answer me, who am a"
2896,SECTION XXXII.,"girl, hardly arrived at youth,—and who am thy wife and companion? That"
2897,SECTION XXXII.,thou at the time of thy espousing my hand hadst vowed—I will practise
2898,SECTION XXXII.,"(righteousness) with thee—do thou, O Kākutstha, recollect the same, and"
2899,SECTION XXXII.,"take me, who am overwhelmed with distress. Why, O best of goers, hast"
2900,SECTION XXXII.,"thou gone from this world to that other, leaving behind me, overwhelmed"
2901,SECTION XXXII.,"with distress? That person of thine which, decked out with auspicious"
2902,SECTION XXXII.,"things, I used to embrace, beasts of prey will for certain tear the"
2903,SECTION XXXII.,same. Having performed the Agnishtoma and other sacrifices with
2904,SECTION XXXII.,"_Dakshinās_ (dispensed),—why hadst not thou attained purity by means of"
2905,SECTION XXXII.,"the sacrificial fire? Kauçalyā, overwhelmed with sorrow, shall only"
2906,SECTION XXXII.,"behold one of the three that had gone away to distant lands,—come"
2907,SECTION XXXII.,"(back)—Lakshmana. And, on being asked by her, he shall relate thine as"
2908,SECTION XXXII.,well as the deaths of thy friend’s troops over night at the hands of the
2909,SECTION XXXII.,"Rākshasas. And, O Rāghava, hearing thee slain while asleep, and me"
2910,SECTION XXXII.,"staying in the abode of the Raksha, she with her heart cleft (in twain),"
2911,SECTION XXXII.,"shall cease to exist. And for the sake of me, abject that I am, that"
2912,SECTION XXXII.,"sinless son of the king, Rāma, possessed of prowess, having crossed the"
2913,SECTION XXXII.,"ocean, hath been slain in the footprint of a cow. I, the befouler of my"
2914,SECTION XXXII.,"line, who had been wedded by Daçaratha’s son through want of discretion,"
2915,SECTION XXXII.,"becoming the wife of the revered Rāma, was (in reality) his Death."
2916,SECTION XXXII.,"Without doubt, in another birth I had abstained from choice gifts,—and"
2917,SECTION XXXII.,"therefore it is that I sorrow to-day, albeit being the wife of one that"
2918,SECTION XXXII.,"was (ever dear) unto guests. Do thou, O Rāvana, speedily slay me upon"
2919,SECTION XXXII.,"Rāma; and, bringing the wife to the husband, compass my best benefit. Do"
2920,SECTION XXXII.,"thou join my head to his and my body to his body. I will, O Rāvana,"
2921,SECTION XXXII.,"follow the way of my high-souled lord"". Thus, burning in grief, did that"
2922,SECTION XXXII.,large-eyed one indulge in lamentations; and Janaka’s daughter kept fast
2923,SECTION XXXII.,gazing at the head and bow of her lord. And as the Rākshasa was by while
2924,SECTION XXXII.,"Sitā was thus bewailing, there appeared before his lord, with joined"
2925,SECTION XXXII.,"hands, the warder, saying,—""May the worshipful one be victorious!"" And"
2926,SECTION XXXII.,"saluting and propitiating him, (Rāvana), he told him that Prahasta,"
2927,SECTION XXXII.,"general of the forces, had arrived. ""Prahasta hath come to thee,"
2928,SECTION XXXII.,"surrounded by all the courtiers. And, O lord, I was despatched by him,"
2929,SECTION XXXII.,"desirous of seeing thee. O mighty monarch, surely there is—and thou art"
2930,SECTION XXXII.,forgiving from thy regal sentiment⁸⁹—some work which is momentous; and
2931,SECTION XXXII.,"do thou see them"". Hearing these words of the Rākshasa, the Ten-necked"
2932,SECTION XXXII.,"one, leaving the açoka wood, went to see the counselors. And, having"
2933,SECTION XXXII.,decided his entire course of action in consultation with his competent
2934,SECTION XXXII.,"advisers, (Rāvana), entering his court,—well knowing Rāma’s prowess, set"
2935,SECTION XXXII.,"about his work. And as soon as Rāvana left that place, that head and"
2936,SECTION XXXII.,"that bow vanished. And in company with the councilors of dreadful power,"
2937,SECTION XXXII.,(Rāvana) decided his course with reference to Rāma. And then the lord of
2938,SECTION XXXII.,"Rākshasas, Rāvana, resembling the day of doom, addressed his"
2939,SECTION XXXII.,"generals,—all well-wishers—staying hard by, saying,—""Do ye speedily"
2940,SECTION XXXII.,summon my forces with the beat of drums—nor do ye give out the reason
2941,SECTION XXXII.,"(of the summons)"". Then assenting to his speech with ""So be it,"" the"
2942,SECTION XXXII.,"envoys immediately summoned that mighty force; and, when it had arrived,"
2943,SECTION XXXII.,"they informed their master, eager for conflict, of its arrival."
2944,SECTION XXXII.,
2945,SECTION XXXII.,⁸⁸ _The carrying out the command of thy sire.—T._

2955,SECTION XXXIII.,"Seeing Sitā overwhelmed with grief, a Rākshasi, named Saramā, who was"
2956,SECTION XXXIII.,"the beloved companion (of Sitā), drew near to her dear (friend),"
2957,SECTION XXXIII.,Vaidehi. And the mild-speeched Saramā comforted the exceedingly
2958,SECTION XXXIII.,"distressed Sitā, who had been bereft of her senses by the lord of"
2959,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rākshasas. Sitā, who was protected there (by Saramā), had been made a"
2960,SECTION XXXIII.,"friend by her. And, protecting her at the command of Rāvana, that"
2961,SECTION XXXIII.,"kind-hearted companion, firm in vows, saw Sitā, deprived of her"
2962,SECTION XXXIII.,consciousness. And she⁹⁰ comforted with a friend’s affection that one of
2963,SECTION XXXIII.,"fair vows, who was rolling in the dust and rising up from it like a"
2964,SECTION XXXIII.,"mare.⁹¹ ""Having come to the solitary wood for protecting thee, I,"
2965,SECTION XXXIII.,"renouncing all fear of Rāvana, have, remaining hid, heard everything"
2966,SECTION XXXIII.,"that he addressed unto thee, as well as what thou hadst replied unto"
2967,SECTION XXXIII.,"him. For thee, O thou of expansive eyes, I have no fear of Rāvana. And,"
2968,SECTION XXXIII.,"O Maithili, I, coming out, have also learnt well as to why the lord of"
2969,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rākshasas hath gone out hence hurriedly. Rāma, acquainted with self, is"
2970,SECTION XXXIII.,incapable of being surprised in sleep; nor doth the slaying of that
2971,SECTION XXXIII.,tiger-like one commend itself to me as probable. And the monkeys
2972,SECTION XXXIII.,"fighting with trees, well protected by Rāghava, like the gods protected"
2973,SECTION XXXIII.,"by the foremost of the celestials, are incapable of being slain. And,"
2974,SECTION XXXIII.,possessed of arms long and rounded; graceful; broad-breasted; powerful;
2975,SECTION XXXIII.,accoutred with the bow; and mailed; righteous; and famous over the
2976,SECTION XXXIII.,"earth; endowed with energy; and along with his brother, Lakshmana, ever"
2977,SECTION XXXIII.,protecting himself and others; of noble descent; and versed in polity;
2978,SECTION XXXIII.,the destroyer of the hostile ranks; and of inconceivable strength and
2979,SECTION XXXIII.,"manhood,—the graceful Rāghava, O Sitā, slayer of foes, is not slain."
2980,SECTION XXXIII.,"This illusion hath been spread around thee by that fierce,"
2981,SECTION XXXIII.,"illusion-creating one, whose mind ever runs upon improper acts and who"
2982,SECTION XXXIII.,"opposeth himself to all creatures.—All thy sorrow hath departed, and thy"
2983,SECTION XXXIII.,"good day hath dawned. Certainly Lakshmi seeketh thee. And, O lady,"
2984,SECTION XXXIII.,"hearken unto what is dear to thee! Having crossed over the ocean, along"
2985,SECTION XXXIII.,"with the monkey-host, Rāma hath encamped himself on the southern shore"
2986,SECTION XXXIII.,of the sea. By me hath been seen the complete Kākutstha along with
2987,SECTION XXXIII.,"Lakshmana, accompanied by the forces, stationed on the marge of the"
2988,SECTION XXXIII.,"main,—protected (by his native might). Those Rākshasas of fleet vigor"
2989,SECTION XXXIII.,"who had been despatched by this one, have brought the news that Rāghava"
2990,SECTION XXXIII.,"hath crossed.—And, O large-eyed lady, having learnt this news,"
2991,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—is consulting with all his counselors"". As the"
2992,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rākshasi, Saramā, was relating this unto Sitā, she heard the leonine"
2993,SECTION XXXIII.,"roars of the army, emitted with the greatest energy. And, hearing the"
2994,SECTION XXXIII.,"mighty sounds of kettledrums produced by sticks struck (thereon), the"
2995,SECTION XXXIII.,"honey-tongued Saramā spoke thus unto Sitā,—""These dreadful sounds of the"
2996,SECTION XXXIII.,"kettledrum, O mother, call to arms. And hark to the solemn notes of the"
2997,SECTION XXXIII.,"kettledrums, resembling the rumbling of clouds! The mad elephants are"
2998,SECTION XXXIII.,caparisoned and the car-horses are yoked; and thousands (of warriors)
2999,SECTION XXXIII.,"are seen, mounted on steeds, with bearded darts in their hands. And, as"
3000,SECTION XXXIII.,"waters fill up the ocean, mailed warriors of wonderful forms, vehement"
3001,SECTION XXXIII.,"and roaring, by thousands rush out on all sides and fill the highways."
3002,SECTION XXXIII.,And mark the splendour spread around by the polished arms and bucklers
3003,SECTION XXXIII.,"and mail,—and by the cars, horses and elephants of the followers of the"
3004,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rākshasa-chief,—consisting of many hues shooting up,—like unto the"
3005,SECTION XXXIII.,"appearance of a fire in summer, burning a forest,—and also mark the"
3006,SECTION XXXIII.,excitement of ihe high-spirited and fast-coursing Rakshas!⁹² And hear
3007,SECTION XXXIII.,the sounds of bells and the rattling of the car-wheels! And hear the
3008,SECTION XXXIII.,neighing of the steeds and the reports of the drums And fierce is the
3009,SECTION XXXIII.,"excitement of these Rākshasas—followers of the Raksha-chief,—with their"
3010,SECTION XXXIII.,"hands hearing upraised arms,—capable of making people’s hair stand on"
3011,SECTION XXXIII.,end. The sorrow removing Sree espouseth thee; and the fear of the
3012,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rakshas is come. And as Vāsava did unto the Daityas, the lotus-eyed"
3013,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rāma, thy lord—of controlled anger, and of inconceivable prowess,"
3014,SECTION XXXIII.,"slaying Rāvana in battle and thus delivering thee, shall approach thee."
3015,SECTION XXXIII.,"And, as Vasava put forth his prowess among his foes, in company with the"
3016,SECTION XXXIII.,"foe-destroying Vishnu, thy lord, along with Lakshmana, shall display his"
3017,SECTION XXXIII.,"prowess among the Rakshas. On the enemy having fallen, I shall behold"
3018,SECTION XXXIII.,"thee, devoted to thy lord, with thy desire attained, soon lying on the"
3019,SECTION XXXIII.,"lap of Rāma. And, O Janaki, embracing (thy lord), thou shalt shed tears"
3020,SECTION XXXIII.,"of joy on his mighty breast. And, O Sitā, soon shall the highly powerful"
3021,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rāma loosen this braid of thine reaching unto thy hips, which thou hast"
3022,SECTION XXXIII.,"been wearing for many a month. And, O exalted one, seeing his face like"
3023,SECTION XXXIII.,"the full moon risen, thou shalt shed water begot of ruth, even as a"
3024,SECTION XXXIII.,"she-serpent casts off her slough. And, O Mithilā’s daughter, speedily"
3025,SECTION XXXIII.,"slaying Rāvana in battle, that one worthy of happiness shall reap"
3026,SECTION XXXIII.,"felicity in the company of thee, his beloved. And, loved by the"
3027,SECTION XXXIII.,"high-souled Rāma, thou shalt be happy, even as the Earth furnished with"
3028,SECTION XXXIII.,"crops brought forth by plenteous showers. Do thou, O exalted one, take"
3029,SECTION XXXIII.,"refuge with him, who, going round the foremost of mountains, speedily"
3030,SECTION XXXIII.,assumeth a steed-like circular movement; for even the maker of day is
3031,SECTION XXXIII.,"the source of people’s joy and grief""."

3049,SECTION XXXIV.,"then, desirous of doing her good, (Sitā’s) friend, conversant with"
3050,SECTION XXXIV.,"season, and ever preluding her speech with a smile, spoke unto her"
3051,SECTION XXXIV.,"seasonably,—""O thou having dark eyes, I can, secretly going to Rāma and"

3053,SECTION XXXIV.,"when I course the supportless sky, can even the Wind or Gāruda follow"

3055,SECTION XXXIV.,"Saramā in sweet and smooth words,—""Thou art capable of even going to the"
3056,SECTION XXXIV.,nethermost regions. But do thou on my behalf that which is fit to be
3057,SECTION XXXIV.,"done by thee. If thou intend doing me a good turn, and if thy sense be"

3059,SECTION XXXIV.,"That guileful and wicked-minded one, Rāvana, destroyer of enemies,"
3060,SECTION XXXIV.,"having powers of illusion, overwhelms me even as the Varuni just drunk."
3061,SECTION XXXIV.,"Confining me here for ever and a day, (Rāvana) sets on dreadful"
3062,SECTION XXXIV.,Rākshasas to alike threaten and scold me constantly. And I am agitated
3063,SECTION XXXIV.,"and alarmed, and my mind is (always) uneasy. And I, dwelling in the"
3064,SECTION XXXIV.,"_açoka_ wood, is ever agitated. If there is any talk (of delivering me),"
3065,SECTION XXXIV.,"or keeping me confined,—thou shouldst communicate unto me the decision"
3066,SECTION XXXIV.,"arrived at. This is the highest favor that I seek (at thy hands)""."
3067,SECTION XXXIV.,"Thereat, the mild-speeched Saramā, wiping (Sitā’s) face washed in tears,"
3068,SECTION XXXIV.,"spake unto her, as she said this,—""If this is thy wish, I will go, O"
3069,SECTION XXXIV.,"Janaki. O Mithilā’s daughter, having possessed myself of the intent of"
3070,SECTION XXXIV.,"the enemy, I shall come back"". Having said this, (Saramā), repairing to"
3071,SECTION XXXIV.,"the Raksha, heard Rāvana’s converse with his counselors. And having"
3072,SECTION XXXIV.,"heard of the decision of that wicked-minded one, she, understanding"
3073,SECTION XXXIV.,"decisions, swiftly retraced her steps to the fair _açoka_ forest. And"
3074,SECTION XXXIV.,"then, entering there, she saw Janaka’s daughter, expecting (her) like a"
3075,SECTION XXXIV.,"very Sri, bereft of her lotus. And, the fair-spoken Saramā, on getting"
3076,SECTION XXXIV.,"back (near her), Sitā, embracing her affectionately, herself gave her a"
3077,SECTION XXXIV.,"seat. ""Sitting down here at ease, do thou relate to me faithfully all"
3078,SECTION XXXIV.,"about the determination of the wicked-minded and guileful Rāvana"". Thus"
3079,SECTION XXXIV.,"accosted by the trembling Sitā, Saramā related everything that had been"
3080,SECTION XXXIV.,"said by Rāvana and his counselors. ""O Vaidehi, the Raksha lord was"
3081,SECTION XXXIV.,advised by his mother and the aged counselors in pregnant words informed
3082,SECTION XXXIV.,"with affection, having thy deliverance for their object. ’Do thou make"
3083,SECTION XXXIV.,"over Maithili unto the king of men, paying him homage due. Thou hast, in"
3084,SECTION XXXIV.,Janasthāna profusely witnessed wonderful instances (of his prowess). The
3085,SECTION XXXIV.,"crossing of the ocean, Hanumān’s sight (of Sitā),—and the slaughter of"
3086,SECTION XXXIV.,"the Rakshas in fight,—what person is capable of doing all this in"
3087,SECTION XXXIV.,"battle?’ Thus long exhorted by his counselors as well as his mother,"
3088,SECTION XXXIV.,"Rāvana doth not make up his mind to emancipate thee, even as a covetuous"
3089,SECTION XXXIV.,"person is loath to part with wealth (appropriated). And, O Maithili,"
3090,SECTION XXXIV.,"without renouncing his life in battle, he doth not intend to liberate"
3091,SECTION XXXIV.,thee. Even this is the determination which that cruel one hath arrived
3092,SECTION XXXIV.,at along with his advisers. This intent is in consequence of their
3093,SECTION XXXIV.,coveting surcease. He can not yield thee up from sheer fear; nor is he
3094,SECTION XXXIV.,"backward in battle, or shirketh his own destruction or that of all the"
3095,SECTION XXXIV.,"Rākshasas. O dark-eyed lady, slaying Rāvana in battle with sharp shafts,"

3099,SECTION XXXIV.,"the servants of the Rākshasa monarch, ran who were in Lankā,—growing"
3100,SECTION XXXIV.,"dispirited and bereft of energy, with weakness overcoming their"

3112,SECTION XXXV.,"conchs. Hearing this noise, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—reflecting for a"
3113,SECTION XXXV.,"while, cast his eyes upon his counselors. And addressing there all those"
3114,SECTION XXXV.,"counsellors, that afflictor of the world—the crooked and highly powerful"
3115,SECTION XXXV.,"lord of the Rākshasas, Rāvana, making his court resound,—running down"
3116,SECTION XXXV.,"(Rāma’s) crossing the main, as well as his vigor, strength and"
3117,SECTION XXXV.,"manhood,—said to them,—""What ye have said touching Rāma’s (prowess),"
3118,SECTION XXXV.,hath been heard by me. And I also know ye to be of sterling valor in the
3119,SECTION XXXV.,"field. Yet why, knowing Rāma’s prowess, do ye silently look at each"
3120,SECTION XXXV.,"other?"" Then the maternal grand sire (of Rāvana), possessed of exceeding"
3121,SECTION XXXV.,"wisdom, named Mālyavān, hearing his words, said,—""The king that is"
3122,SECTION XXXV.,"accomplished in the various kinds of learning,⁹⁴ and that followeth"
3123,SECTION XXXV.,"polity, ever commandeth affluence and bringeth his enemies under his"
3124,SECTION XXXV.,subjection. He that seasonably concludes peace and carries on war with
3125,SECTION XXXV.,"his enemies,—and who advances his own party, attaineth great affluence."
3126,SECTION XXXV.,"A king should enter into peace, if he be an equal or inferior of his"
3127,SECTION XXXV.,"adversary, and engage in war, if be more powerful,—but an enemy should"
3128,SECTION XXXV.,"never be disregarded. Therefore, O Rāvana, peace with Rāma is what"
3129,SECTION XXXV.,commends itself to me; and do thou render unto him that for which thou
3130,SECTION XXXV.,"hast been invaded (by him), _viz._, Sitā. All the Devarshis and"
3131,SECTION XXXV.,"Gandharvas wish for (Rāma’s) victory. Therefore, do not enter into"
3132,SECTION XXXV.,hostilities with him; but do thou bend thy mind to ther conclusion of
3133,SECTION XXXV.,"peace with him. That possessor of the six attributes, the Great-father,"
3134,SECTION XXXV.,"hath appointed two courses, (respectively) for the Asuras and the"
3135,SECTION XXXV.,"celestials, having for their proper objects righteousness and"
3136,SECTION XXXV.,"unrighteousness. Righteousness, we hear, is the course of the"
3137,SECTION XXXV.,"high-souled celestials, as, O Rākshasa, unrighteousness is that of"
3138,SECTION XXXV.,"Rakshas and Asuras. During the Krita Yuga, righteousness swalloweth up"
3139,SECTION XXXV.,"sin; and during Tishya,⁹⁵ unrigheousness swalloweth up virtue. Thou,"
3140,SECTION XXXV.,"ranging the three worlds, hadst extinguished pregnant piety, and reaped"
3141,SECTION XXXV.,unrighteousness; and it is for this that thy foes have waxed potent.⁹⁶
3142,SECTION XXXV.,"And, having grown through thy neglect, unrighteousness devoureth us, and"
3143,SECTION XXXV.,"that protector of the gods, (righteousness), is strengthening the side"
3144,SECTION XXXV.,"of the celestials. Thou, addicted to carnal pleasures and acting in"
3145,SECTION XXXV.,"defiance of duty, hadst aroused the high wrath of the saints resembling"
3146,SECTION XXXV.,fire. The power of these possessed of souls sanctified through
3147,SECTION XXXV.,"asceticism, and ever engaged in invoking the aid of righteousness, is"
3148,SECTION XXXV.,incapable of being resisted and is like flaming fire. The twice-born
3149,SECTION XXXV.,"ones engage in contemplation with intent minds, and loudly recite the"
3150,SECTION XXXV.,"Vedas. They overpower the Rakshas, uttering the Vedas; and thereat they"
3151,SECTION XXXV.,fly in all directions like clouds scattered in summer. And the smoke
3152,SECTION XXXV.,"that ariseth from the Agnihotra sacrifices of saints resembling fire,"
3153,SECTION XXXV.,"enveloping the energy of the Rākshasas, spreads over the ten cardinal"
3154,SECTION XXXV.,"quarters. And ther fierce austerities of vow-observing saints, performed"
3155,SECTION XXXV.,"at particular sacred spots, try the Rākshasas sore. Thou hast obtained a"
3156,SECTION XXXV.,"boon, conferring immunity at the hands of deities, Dānavas and Yakshas."
3157,SECTION XXXV.,"But men and monkeys, bears and Golāngulas, possessed of enormous"
3158,SECTION XXXV.,"strength and endowed with vigor, and of indomitable prowess,—coming"

3160,SECTION XXXV.,perceive the destruction of all the Rākshasas. Dreadful and terrific
3161,SECTION XXXV.,"clouds, uttering harsh sounds, are showering blood all around Lankā. And"
3162,SECTION XXXV.,"(live) vehicles are dropping profuse tears. And all sides, covered with"
3163,SECTION XXXV.,"dust, do not appear bright as formerly. And beasts of prey, jackals and"
3164,SECTION XXXV.,"vultures, are emitting frightful cries, and, entering into the garden of"
3165,SECTION XXXV.,"Lankā, form themselves into bands. And in dreams mighty dark-hued women"
3166,SECTION XXXV.,"in front of dwellings, seizing at (the furniture ) thereof, and speaking"
3167,SECTION XXXV.,"inauspiciously, laugh displaying their sable teeth. And in houses dogs"
3168,SECTION XXXV.,"are feasting on the articles of worship. And cows bring forth asses, and"
3169,SECTION XXXV.,"mongooses, mice. And cats are pairing with leopards, and swine with"
3170,SECTION XXXV.,"dogs, and Kinnaras with Rākshasas and human beings. And red-footed white"
3171,SECTION XXXV.,"sky-coursing pigeons, urged on by Doom, are going about for the"
3172,SECTION XXXV.,"destruction of the Rākshasas. And female-parrots in houses, wounded and"
3173,SECTION XXXV.,"worsted by other birds delighting in discord, are dropping down,"
3174,SECTION XXXV.,emitting indistinct notes. And all the birds and beasts are crying
3175,SECTION XXXV.,(distressfully) with their faces turned towards the sun. And at dusk a
3176,SECTION XXXV.,"frightful, withered, tawny-hued male figure, looking like Death himself,"
3177,SECTION XXXV.,"with his head shaven, peereth into the houses (of people). These and"
3178,SECTION XXXV.,other evil omens occur. Rāma I deem as Vishnu assuming the form of a
3179,SECTION XXXV.,"man. Rāghava of steady prowess, for certain, is no human being,—he that"
3180,SECTION XXXV.,"hath built a bridge over the deep, must be an exceedingly wonderful"
3181,SECTION XXXV.,"person. Therefore, O Rāvana, conclude peace with Rāma—king of men."
3182,SECTION XXXV.,"Having ascertained fit course, do thou act properly"". Having said this"
3183,SECTION XXXV.,"unto that vile one, and knowing the intention of the lord of Rakshas,"
3184,SECTION XXXV.,"that strong Mālyavān, of exceeding prowess, became silent, eying Rāvana."

3201,SECTION XXXVI.,"he, coming under the masterdom of passion, with his eyes rolling in"
3202,SECTION XXXVI.,"wrath, addressed Mālyavān, saying,—""The words which, deeming the"
3203,SECTION XXXVI.,"strength of the enemy as superior, thou hast harshly spoken, considering"
3204,SECTION XXXVI.,"it as beneficial, had never before entered my ears. A (mere) man, and"
3205,SECTION XXXVI.,"feeble, and alone, and having monkeys for his support, why dost thou"
3206,SECTION XXXVI.,"deem Rāma, who hath (further) been cast off by his sire, and hath in"
3207,SECTION XXXVI.,"consequence taken refuge in the woods,—as competent (to cope with me)?"
3208,SECTION XXXVI.,"And why dost thou consider me, who am the lord of the Rakshas, and"
3209,SECTION XXXVI.,"feared even by the immortals,—as weak and reft of all power? Thou, I"
3210,SECTION XXXVI.,"suspect, speakest (thus) roughly either from jealousy of my heroism, or"
3211,SECTION XXXVI.,"for inciting me. And who that is wise and learned, ever addresseth him"
3212,SECTION XXXVI.,"roughly that is at once puissant and of (high) station, if not to spur"
3213,SECTION XXXVI.,"him on? Why, having brought Sitā like a Sri shorn of her lotus, shall I"
3214,SECTION XXXVI.,"give her up, from fear of Rāghava? Behold Rāghava, environed by Kotis of"
3215,SECTION XXXVI.,"monkeys, with Sugriva and Lakshmana, slain one of these days! He before"
3216,SECTION XXXVI.,"whom even the gods cannot stay in the field,—how can that Rāvana ever"
3217,SECTION XXXVI.,"come by fear? Better that I should be riven in twain,—but bend I never"
3218,SECTION XXXVI.,will. This is my native fault; and nature is incapable of being
3219,SECTION XXXVI.,overcome. And if Rāma hath at his pleasure constructed a bridge over the
3220,SECTION XXXVI.,"ocean, what is the wonder in this that thou hast conceived such a fear?"
3221,SECTION XXXVI.,"And although Rāma hath crossed the ocean along with the monkey-army, yet"
3222,SECTION XXXVI.,"I swear unto thee truly, living, he shall not back hence"". When Rāvana,"
3223,SECTION XXXVI.,"wrought up with passion, had spoken thus, Mālyavān, knowing him wroth,"
3224,SECTION XXXVI.,"did not return a reply. And, duly tendering blessings unto the king,"
3225,SECTION XXXVI.,"Mālyavān, taking his permission, went to his own abode. And the"
3226,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasa, Rāvana, along with his courtiers, having consulted together as"
3227,SECTION XXXVI.,"to what was fit to be done, set about the defence of Lankā. And he"
3228,SECTION XXXVI.,commanded the Rākshasa Prahasta (to guard) the Eastern gate; and the
3229,SECTION XXXVI.,exceedingly powerful Mahāpārçwa and Mahodara (to guard) the Southern
3230,SECTION XXXVI.,"gate; and he ordered his son Indrajit, possessing mighty powers of"
3231,SECTION XXXVI.,"illusion, girt by innumerable Rākshasas, to guard the Western gate. And"
3232,SECTION XXXVI.,he commanded Suka and Sārana to defend the Northern gate. But he said
3233,SECTION XXXVI.,"unto the counsellors,—""I will myself go thither"".⁹⁷ And he posted in the"
3234,SECTION XXXVI.,"middle in the garrison the Rākshasa, Virupāksha, endowed with exceeding"
3235,SECTION XXXVI.,"prowess and energy, backed by countless Rākshasas. Having taken these"
3236,SECTION XXXVI.,"measures in Lankā, the Rākshasa-chief, urged by Fate, deemed himself as"
3237,SECTION XXXVI.,having achieved success. Having thus completely provided for the defence
3238,SECTION XXXVI.,"of the city, he dismissed the ministers; and, honored by the counsellors"
3239,SECTION XXXVI.,"with blessings of victory, (then) entered his magnificent and splendid"
3240,SECTION XXXVI.,inner apartment.

3254,SECTION XXXVII.,"ruled by Rāvana, invincible even unto the celestials, serpents and"
3255,SECTION XXXVII.,"Gandharvas. Let us, keeping before us success in the enterprise, consult"
3256,SECTION XXXVII.,together for the purpose of arriving at a decision. We are here daily
3257,SECTION XXXVII.,"nearing Rāvana, lord of Rākshasas"". As they were speaking thus, Rāvana’s"
3258,SECTION XXXVII.,"younger brother, Bibhishana, said in a pregnant speech free from"
3259,SECTION XXXVII.,"provincialism,—""Anala, Panaça, Sampāti and Pramāti—all courtiers of"
3260,SECTION XXXVII.,"mine—having gone up to Lankā, have come back here. Wearing the forms of"
3261,SECTION XXXVII.,"birds, they entered into the hostile forces; and, having seen the"
3262,SECTION XXXVII.,"measures that had been adopted (by them), have come (back). O Rāma,"
3263,SECTION XXXVII.,hearken to me as I tell thee truly anent the provisions which they have
3264,SECTION XXXVII.,"related, made by the wicked-minded Rāvana. In the Eastern gate stayeth"
3265,SECTION XXXVII.,"Prahasta along with his forces; in the Southern, the exceedingly"
3266,SECTION XXXVII.,"powerful Mahāpārçwa and Mahodara; and in the Western, Rāvana’s son,"
3267,SECTION XXXVII.,"Indrajit, supported by innumerable Rākshasas, equipped with _pattiças_,"
3268,SECTION XXXVII.,"swords and bows, and bearing darts and maces in their hands,—surrounded"
3269,SECTION XXXVII.,"by heroes carrying various weapons. And, backed by many thousands of"
3270,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rākshasas weilding weapons, and accompanied by Rākshasas conversant with"
3271,SECTION XXXVII.,"counsel, Rāvana himself, his heart agitated to the height, guardeth the"
3272,SECTION XXXVII.,Northern gate of the city. And Virupāksha with a powerful force
3273,SECTION XXXVII.,"accoutred in javelins, clubs and bows, protects the garrison in the"
3274,SECTION XXXVII.,"centre. Having seen these hosts thus disposed in Lankā, my counsellors"
3275,SECTION XXXVII.,"have speedily come back here. There are ten thousand elephants, an Ayuta"
3276,SECTION XXXVII.,"cars, two of horses, and about a _koti_ of Rākshasas, powerful and"
3277,SECTION XXXVII.,"strong, and equipped with arms in conflict.⁹⁸ These night-rangers are"
3278,SECTION XXXVII.,"ever the favorites of the Rākshasa ruler. And, O king, a _koti_ of"
3279,SECTION XXXVII.,"forces accompany each of these Rākshasas in battle"". Having conveyed"
3280,SECTION XXXVII.,"this information concerning Lankā, which had been communicated by his"
3281,SECTION XXXVII.,"counsellors, the mighty-armed Bibhishana showed (unto Rāma) those"
3282,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rākshasas themselves. And in company with his counsellors, Rāvana’s"
3283,SECTION XXXVII.,"graceful younger brother, ever striving for the welfare of Rāma, by way"
3284,SECTION XXXVII.,of answer communicated everything that was going forward in Lankā unto
3285,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāma, having eyes resembling lotus-leaves,—""O Rāma, when Rāvana battled"
3286,SECTION XXXVII.,"with Kuvera, sixty lacs of Rākshasas marched forth (to meet him). In"
3287,SECTION XXXVII.,"prowess, energy, vigor, exceeding fortitude, and hauteur, they resembled"
3288,SECTION XXXVII.,"the wicked-minded Rāvana himself. In this matter, thou ought not to grow"
3289,SECTION XXXVII.,"wroth,—I only arouse thy wrath, and do not endeavour to frighten thee.⁹⁹"
3290,SECTION XXXVII.,"Thou canst subdue even the celestials by thy prowess. Therefore thou,"
3291,SECTION XXXVII.,"environed by a mighty army, having arrayed the monkey-forces in order of"
3292,SECTION XXXVII.,"battle, shalt thrash Rāvana (in battle)"". When Rāvana’s younger brother"
3293,SECTION XXXVII.,"had spoken thus, Rāghava, said these words with reference to his beating"
3294,SECTION XXXVII.,"the foe,—""Let that foremost of monkeys, Nilā, surrounded by an immense"
3295,SECTION XXXVII.,"number of monkeys, cope with Prahasta at the Eastern gate of Lankā. And,"
3296,SECTION XXXVII.,"engirt by a mighty force, let Angada, son of Vāli, resist Mahāparçwa and"
3297,SECTION XXXVII.,Mahodara at the Southern gate (thereof). And let that son of the
3298,SECTION XXXVII.,"Wind-god, Hanumān, backed by innumerable monkeys, (beating the host"
3299,SECTION XXXVII.,"stationed) at the Western gate, find entrance (into the city). I myself,"
3300,SECTION XXXVII.,"determined to compass the destruction of the lord of Rākshasas, who,"
3301,SECTION XXXVII.,"waxing powerful in consequence of the boon he hath received, hath"
3302,SECTION XXXVII.,brought about the destruction of high-souled saints resembling gods and
3303,SECTION XXXVII.,"Dānavas,—and who goeth round all regions, oppressing people,—will, along"
3304,SECTION XXXVII.,"with Sumitrā’s son, smiting (the foe), occupy the Northern entrance,"
3305,SECTION XXXVII.,where Rāvana with his army is stationed. And let the powerful king of
3306,SECTION XXXVII.,"monkeys, and the puissant sovereign of bears, and the younger brother of"
3307,SECTION XXXVII.,"the Rākshasa-chief, manage the soldiery posted in the centre. And in"
3308,SECTION XXXVII.,"this battle, the monkeys need not assume the forms of human being. And"
3309,SECTION XXXVII.,"let this serve for a sign that the monkeys, in order to the recognition"
3310,SECTION XXXVII.,"of our own forces, appear with their proper monkey-marks. We seven only"
3311,SECTION XXXVII.,"shall battle with the foe in human shapes,—_viz_., I along with my"
3312,SECTION XXXVII.,"brother, the exceedingly energetic Lakshmana, and my friend Bibhishana"
3313,SECTION XXXVII.,"counting for the fifth in company with his own following"". Having said"
3314,SECTION XXXVII.,"this unto Bibhishana, for attaining success in the enterprise, that"
3315,SECTION XXXVII.,"lord, the intelligent Rāma, seeing the sides of Suvela more beautiful"
3316,SECTION XXXVII.,"(than other places), intended to ascend it. Then, environed by a mighty"
3317,SECTION XXXVII.,"host, the high-souled and magnanimous Rāma, his features mirroring forth"
3318,SECTION XXXVII.,"high exultation,—overshadowing the entire Earth (with his forces), set"

3334,SECTION XXXVIII.,"precepts, who was devoted to him,—saying,—""We shall all ascend this"
3335,SECTION XXXVIII.,"mount Suvela, bedight with metals; and pass this night even here. And"
3336,SECTION XXXVIII.,"(from here) will we view the abode of that Rākshasa who, foul of soul,"

3339,SECTION XXXVIII.,"dignity of his descent),—and who, in consequence of his base propensity,"

3341,SECTION XXXVIII.,"thus, Rāma, filled with wrath at Rāvana, coming to Suvela, ascended its"

3349,SECTION XXXVIII.,"And the monkey-leaders beheld Lankā, exceedingly splendid with noble"
3350,SECTION XXXVIII.,gateways; gracefully enclosed with a wall; thronging with Rākshasas; and
3351,SECTION XXXVIII.,defended by sable Rākshasas. And the foremost of monkeys saw these
3352,SECTION XXXVIII.,appearing like another wall (overtopping the one beneath). And on seeing
3353,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the Rākshasas, the monkeys burning for battle set up various roars in"
3354,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the presence of Rāma. Then the Sun, crimsoned with Eve, ascended the"
3355,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Setting-hill and Night came, illumined by the Moon at his full. Then the"

3375,SECTION XXXIX.,"blue lawns, and rows of woods; and bearing odourous and charming"
3376,SECTION XXXIX.,"blossoms and fruits,—looked like men adorned with ornaments. And there a"
3377,SECTION XXXIX.,"delightful and pleasant wood resembling Chaitraratha, and like unto"

3380,SECTION XXXIX.,and peacocks dancing; and the strains of the coels were heard at the
3381,SECTION XXXIX.,"woodland rills. And the heroic and exhilarated monkeys, capable of"

3387,SECTION XXXIX.,there blew upon them the breeze—like unto life—redolent of perfume
3388,SECTION XXXIX.,obtained from contact with the blossoms. And others of the leaders among
3389,SECTION XXXIX.,"the heroic monkeys, coming out from the bands, ordered by Sugriva, made"
3390,SECTION XXXIX.,"in the direction of Lankā crowned with ensigns. And, terrifying the"

3392,SECTION XXXIX.,"roars, those foremost monkeys set up shouts. And they, endowed with"
3393,SECTION XXXIX.,"great impetuosity, went on, oppressing the earth with their"

3443,SECTION XL.,"monkeys as well as Rāghava. And influenced by wrath, he, mustering"
3444,SECTION XL.,"strength and vigor, rising from the brow of the mountain, bounded to the"
3445,SECTION XL.,"gateway. And pausing for a while and eying the Rākshasa intrepidly, he,"

3448,SECTION XL.,"backed by the energy of that king of the Earth, shalt thou not escape"

3450,SECTION XL.,"snatching away his variegated crown, let it fall on the earth. And"
3451,SECTION XL.,"seeing him come abruptly, the night-ranger spoke to him thus,—""Thou that"

3453,SECTION XL.,"this, he rose up swiftly and dragged him¹⁰³ down to the earth. Thereat"
3454,SECTION XL.,"springing like pith, the monkey pushed down his antagonist with his"

3475,SECTION XL.,"arms like unto the trunks of elephants, fought for a long while, swiftly"
3476,SECTION XL.,"wheeling about the arena. And approaching each other, they strove to"

3567,SECTION XLI.,"fierce; and harsh-sounding. And wearing terrific looks, they fiercely"
3568,SECTION XLI.,pour down showers mixed with drops of blood. And the Evening resembles
3569,SECTION XLI.,"the red sandal, and is fearful. And a flaming circle droppeth from the"
3570,SECTION XLI.,"Sun. And exciting great fear, inauspicious birds and beasts, wearing"
3571,SECTION XLI.,"cruel looks, and in distressful guise,—cry in piteous accents, facing"
3572,SECTION XLI.,"the Sun. And at night, the ominous Moon with a black-red brim as at the"

3580,SECTION XLI.,"very day with all expedition shall we, surrounded on all sides by the"

3582,SECTION XLI.,"unto Lakshmana, Lakshmana’s elder brother possessed of exceeding"
3583,SECTION XLI.,"strength, hastily descended from the top of the mountain. And descending"
3584,SECTION XLI.,"from the mountain, the righteous Rāghava surveyed his troops, incapable"
3585,SECTION XLI.,of being beaten by enemies. And after making the mighty host of the
3586,SECTION XLI.,"monkey-king equip itself, Rāghava versed in season, along with Sugriva,"
3587,SECTION XLI.,"at the proper hour, issued orders for battle. Then in due time that one,"
3588,SECTION XLI.,"accoutred with his bow, surrounded by a mighty army, set out, with the"
3589,SECTION XLI.,intention of entering the city of Lankā. And those two—Bibhishana and
3590,SECTION XLI.,"Sugriva—and Hanumān, and Jāmbavān, and Nala, and the bear-king Nila, and"
3591,SECTION XLI.,"Lakshmana, followed (Rāma). Behind them, the mighty array of bears and"
3592,SECTION XLI.,"monkeys followed Rāghava, covering a wide surface of land. The monkeys,"
3593,SECTION XLI.,"resembling elephants, capable of resisting foes, took mountain-peaks and"
3594,SECTION XLI.,tall trees by hundreds. And in a short time those repressors of foes—the
3595,SECTION XLI.,brothers Rāma and Lakshmana—arrived at the city of Rāvana; with pennons
3596,SECTION XLI.,streaming over her; charming; garnished with groves and woods; having
3597,SECTION XLI.,variegated gateways; inaccessible; and having walls and gates. And urged
3598,SECTION XLI.,"on by Rāma’s command, the wood-rangers,¹¹⁶ as commanded, blocking up"
3599,SECTION XLI.,"(Lankā) incapable of being subdued even by the gods, stationed"
3600,SECTION XLI.,"themselves. Coming to Lankā ruled by Rāvana, that hero, Rāma, son unto"
3601,SECTION XLI.,"Daçaratha, along with Lakshmana, remained stationed at the Northern"
3602,SECTION XLI.,"gate, where Rāvana used to reside. None save Rāma was competent to"
3603,SECTION XLI.,"protect that dreadful gate, where Rāvana used to reside. None save Rāma"
3604,SECTION XLI.,"was competent to protect that dreadful gate, guarded by Rāvana himself,"
3605,SECTION XLI.,"like the Ocean guarded by Varuna,—and protected on all sides by terrible"
3606,SECTION XLI.,Rākshasas equipped with weapons; capable of striking terror into the
3607,SECTION XLI.,weak; like unto the nether regions guarded by Dānavas. And (Rāma) saw
3608,SECTION XLI.,"there many and various arms and mail of the warriors, ranged together."
3609,SECTION XLI.,"And coming to the Eastern gate, that leader of the monkey-army, the"
3610,SECTION XLI.,"powerful Nila, along with Mainda and Dwivida,—took up his post there."
3611,SECTION XLI.,"And the exceedingly strong Angada, accompanied by Rishava, Gavāksha,"
3612,SECTION XLI.,"Gaya, and Gavaya, occupied the Southern gate. And the mighty monkey"
3613,SECTION XLI.,"Hanumān protected the Western entrance. And Sugriva himself, with"
3614,SECTION XLI.,"Prajangha, Tarasa and other heroes, was quartered near the garrision in"
3615,SECTION XLI.,the centre. And accompanied by all the foremost monkeys resembling
3616,SECTION XLI.,"Suparna or the Wind, twenty _kotis_ of renowned monkey-leaders, blocking"
3617,SECTION XLI.,"up all sides, stationed themselves near the monkey, Sugriva. And at"
3618,SECTION XLI.,"Rāma’s command, Lakshmana along with Bibhishana, went from door to door,"
3619,SECTION XLI.,"issuing instructions to _kotis_ of monkeys. On the west of Rāma,"
3620,SECTION XLI.,"Jāmbavān along with Sushena, followed by innumerable troops, remained"
3621,SECTION XLI.,"hard by at the garrison in the middle. And those tiger-like monkeys,"
3622,SECTION XLI.,"furnished with teeth like unto tigers, weilding trees and mountain-tops,"
3623,SECTION XLI.,"stood ready for fight. And all had their tails curled up, and all were"
3624,SECTION XLI.,"armed with teeth and nails, and all had chequered bodies, and all had"
3625,SECTION XLI.,frightful faces. And some had the strength of ten elephants; and some
3626,SECTION XLI.,had strength ten times as much; and some of the monkey-leaders there had
3627,SECTION XLI.,"the strength of a thousand elephants,—and some had the strength of"
3628,SECTION XLI.,numbers (of elephants); and some had strength hundred times as much. And
3629,SECTION XLI.,others had immeasurable might. And wonderful and astonishing was their
3630,SECTION XLI.,meeting. And the concourse at that place of the monkey-forces was like
3631,SECTION XLI.,"the concourse of locusts. And the air was filled up, and the earth was"
3632,SECTION XLI.,covered quite with the monkeys coursing towards Lankā and dropping down
3633,SECTION XLI.,"into it. And hundreds and thousands making up the army of monkeys,"
3634,SECTION XLI.,arrived at the gate of Lankā; while others were pouring in from all
3635,SECTION XLI.,sides for encounter. And that mount was covered with monkeys. And a
3636,SECTION XLI.,"thousand _ayutas_ were going round the city. And Lankā, blocked up"
3637,SECTION XLI.,"everywhere with powerful monkeys bearing trees in their hands, was"
3638,SECTION XLI.,"incapable of being entered even by the Wind. And the Rākshasas, sore"
3639,SECTION XLI.,"pressed by thousands of monkeys resembling masses of clouds, and like"
3640,SECTION XLI.,"unto Sakra himself in battle, were seized with amazement. And like unto"
3641,SECTION XLI.,"the roar of water on the ocean being riven, there arose a mighty tumult"
3642,SECTION XLI.,in consequence of the forces surging hither and thither. And with that
3643,SECTION XLI.,"sound the entire Lankā, with her wall and gateways, her mountains,"
3644,SECTION XLI.,"woods, and forests, began to shake. And that army, protected by Rāma and"
3645,SECTION XLI.,"Lakshmana as well as Sugriva, became all the more invincible even by the"
3646,SECTION XLI.,Asuras and celestials. And having arranged his forces with the view of
3647,SECTION XLI.,"destroying the Rakshas, Rāghava, versed in the resources of war,¹¹⁷"
3648,SECTION XLI.,"taking counsel of the counsellors, and deciding again and again his"
3649,SECTION XLI.,"course of action,—intending to adopt further measures,—resolved to abide"
3650,SECTION XLI.,"by the advice of Bibhishana¹¹⁸, remembering the morality regulating"
3651,SECTION XLI.,"monarchs¹¹⁹. And then, calling Vāli’s son, Angada, (Rāma) said,—""O mild"
3652,SECTION XLI.,"one, going to the Ten-necked one, tell him in my words,—’Bounding over"
3653,SECTION XLI.,"the deep and casting off fear and dejection, I have laid seige to the"
3654,SECTION XLI.,city of Lankā; and have reft thee of thy prosperity and thy wealth; and
3655,SECTION XLI.,"rendered thee moribund and senseless. Thou hast, O night-ranger, through"
3656,SECTION XLI.,"delusion and pride injured saints and celestials, and Gandharvas and"
3657,SECTION XLI.,"Apsaras, and Serpents, and Yakshas, and crowned heads. But, O Rākshasa,"
3658,SECTION XLI.,thy pride begot of the boon received from the Self-create hath gone from
3659,SECTION XLI.,"thee, whose destroyer,¹²⁰ I, afflicted in consequence of my wife having"
3660,SECTION XLI.,"been carried off,—weilding the rod, have sat down at the door of Lankā."
3661,SECTION XLI.,"O Rākshasa, thou shalt, remaining steady in fight, attain the state of"
3662,SECTION XLI.,"celestials and Maharshis and Rājarshis. And, O worst of Rākshasas, do"
3663,SECTION XLI.,"thou display that prowess of thine by which, aided by thy power of"
3664,SECTION XLI.,"illusion, thou hast forcibly carried off Sitā, disregarding me. I shall"
3665,SECTION XLI.,"with my sharpened shafts render this world free from Rākshasas, unless"
3666,SECTION XLI.,"rendering back Mithilā’s daughter, thou throw thyself on my mercy. And,"
3667,SECTION XLI.,"for certain, that foremost of Rākshasas, the righteous and graceful"
3668,SECTION XLI.,"Bibhishana, who hath joined us, shall obtain, without having a thorn in"
3669,SECTION XLI.,"his side, all this wealth of Lankā. For thou, foolish, wicked, ignorant"
3670,SECTION XLI.,"of self-knowledge, and having dolts for counsellors, art not competent"
3671,SECTION XLI.,"to unrighteously exercise kingship for a moment. Fight thou, O Rākshasa,"
3672,SECTION XLI.,"summoning fortitude and heroism. On being slain with my shafts, thou"
3673,SECTION XLI.,"shalt attain peace.¹²¹ O night-ranger, if thou shouldst range the three"
3674,SECTION XLI.,"worlds in the shape of a bird, thou, coming in my ken, shalt not be able"
3675,SECTION XLI.,to preserve thy life. It is all this for thy good; do thou perform acts
3676,SECTION XLI.,for the good of thy body surviving death; and do thou see Lankā well;
3677,SECTION XLI.,"for thy life is in my keeping.’"" Thus addressed by Rāma of untiring"
3678,SECTION XLI.,"deeds, Tarā’s son went through the welkin like the embodied bearer of"
3679,SECTION XLI.,"sacrificial offerings.¹²² And arriving near that subduer of enemies,"
3680,SECTION XLI.,"Rāvana, in a moment, that graceful one saw Rāvana, sitting calmly in the"
3681,SECTION XLI.,midst of his ministers. And dropping down in his vicinity like a flaming
3682,SECTION XLI.,"fire, that best of monkeys, Angada, resembling a golden bracelet,¹²³"
3683,SECTION XLI.,"stood there. And then introducing himself, Angada delivered unto Rāvana"
3684,SECTION XLI.,"along with his ministers all that Rāma had excellently spoken unto him,"
3685,SECTION XLI.,"neither extenuating nor setting down aught of himself,—""I am the envoy"
3686,SECTION XLI.,of the king of Koçala—Rāma of untiring deeds; and I am the son of
3687,SECTION XLI.,"Vāli.—I do not know whether thou hast heard of me. And Raghu’s son,"
3688,SECTION XLI.,"Rāma—enhancer of Kauçalyā’s joy—hath said unto thee,—’Do thou, O fell"
3689,SECTION XLI.,"one, coming out, give me battle and prove thy prowess. Thee shall I slay"
3690,SECTION XLI.,"together with thy ministers, and with thy sons and relations and"
3691,SECTION XLI.,"friends. And thou being slain, the three worlds shall attain peace. And"
3692,SECTION XLI.,"to-day shall I destroy the enemy of the gods and Dānavas, and Yakshas,"
3693,SECTION XLI.,"of the Gandharvas, serpents and Rākshasas,—and the thorn (in the side"
3694,SECTION XLI.,"of) the saints. And on thee being slain, all the wealth shall be"
3695,SECTION XLI.,"Bibhishana’s; unless, bowing down (unto me) and paying me homage, thou"
3696,SECTION XLI.,"render back Maithili.’"" When that monkey-chief had spoken thus, the lord"
3697,SECTION XLI.,of the night-rangers was wrought up with wrath. And coming under the
3698,SECTION XLI.,"sway of passion, he commanded his counsellors, saying,—""Take this one of"
3699,SECTION XLI.,"perverse understanding, and slay him at once""."
3700,SECTION XLI.,
3701,SECTION XLI.,"Hearing Rāvana’s speech, four grim-visaged night-rangers seized (Angada)"
3702,SECTION XLI.,flaming in energy like fire itself. And Tārā’s son suffered himself to
3703,SECTION XLI.,"be taken, in order that the hero might then display his prowess before"
3704,SECTION XLI.,"the Yātudhānas.¹²⁴ Then Angada, taking them up, who were pressed against"
3705,SECTION XLI.,"his arms, like insects,—leapt up on a palace resembling a hill. Thereat,"
3706,SECTION XLI.,"in consequence of the impetuosity of his bound, the Rākshasas, slipping"
3707,SECTION XLI.,"off, fell on to the ground in the very sight of the Rākshasa king. Then"
3708,SECTION XLI.,"the powerful son of Vāli with his legs attacked the top of that palace,"
3709,SECTION XLI.,"elevated like a hill,¹²⁵ of the lord of Rākshasas. And thereat, as"
3710,SECTION XLI.,"formerly the summit of the Himavān had been cleft by the thunderbolt,"
3711,SECTION XLI.,"the palace, thus assailed, was split in the very presence of the"
3712,SECTION XLI.,"Ten-necked one. Having reft the top of the edifice, and proclaimed his"
3713,SECTION XLI.,"name, Angada, setting up a mighty roar, sprang into the sky. And,"
3714,SECTION XLI.,"aggrieving the Rākshasas and rejoicing all the monkeys, he came back to"
3715,SECTION XLI.,the side of Rāma in the midst of the monkeys. Rāvana was transported
3716,SECTION XLI.,"with wrath in consequence of the breaking down of the palace. And,"
3717,SECTION XLI.,"finding his destruction (at hand), he began to heave sighs. And Rāma,"
3718,SECTION XLI.,"surrounded by innumerable delighted monkeys setting up shouts,—anxious"
3719,SECTION XLI.,"for slaying his foe, prepared for battle. And at the command of Sugriva,"
3720,SECTION XLI.,"the exceedingly powerful monkey—Sushena—resembling a mountain-summit,"
3721,SECTION XLI.,surrounded by a large number of monkeys capable of assuming shapes at
3722,SECTION XLI.,"pleasure, began to range from door to door;¹²⁶ like the Moon ranging the"
3723,SECTION XLI.,"stars. Seeing the hundred _akshauhinis_ of the wood-rangers, stationed"
3724,SECTION XLI.,"in Lankā, extending down to the sea, some of the Rākshasas were struck"
3725,SECTION XLI.,"with astonishment, while some came under the influence of fear; and some"
3726,SECTION XLI.,experienced delight from the (anticipated) delight of battle. And the
3727,SECTION XLI.,space between the well and the moat all was flooded with monkeys. And
3728,SECTION XLI.,the distressed Rākshasas saw the wall thronging with monkeys;¹²⁷ and
3729,SECTION XLI.,"thereat exclaiming ""Alas"" ""Alas,"" the Rākshasas were extremely"
3730,SECTION XLI.,"terrified. And on that frightful uproar arising, the warriors of the"

3776,SECTION XLII.,"Then those Rākshasas, going to that subduer of enemies, Rāvana, informed"
3777,SECTION XLII.,him that Rāma along with the monkeys had laid seige unto the city.
3778,SECTION XLII.,"Hearing the city beseiged, the night-ranger was enraged. And, hearing"
3779,SECTION XLII.,that double arrangements had been made (by Rāma) in guarding the
3780,SECTION XLII.,"gateways, (Rāvana) ascended the palace. He saw Lankā with her hills,"
3781,SECTION XLII.,"woods, and forests, covered everywhere with innumerable monkeys eager"
3782,SECTION XLII.,for encounter. And he saw the entire Earth tawneyed with the monkeys;
3783,SECTION XLII.,and he reflected within himself how he could destroy these. And
3784,SECTION XLII.,"reflecting for long, Rāvana having expansive eyes, assuming patience,"
3785,SECTION XLII.,gazed at Rāghava and the leader of monkeys. Rāghava with his host was
3786,SECTION XLII.,fast approaching (the wall); and Rāvana saw Lankā defended on all sides
3787,SECTION XLII.,"by Rākshasas. And Daçaratha’s son, seeing Lankā crowned with variegated"
3788,SECTION XLII.,"ensigns and standards, mentally went to Sitā, with a sad heart. ""For my"
3789,SECTION XLII.,"sake, here that one, Janaka’s daughter, having eyes resembling those of"
3790,SECTION XLII.,"a young deer,—is undergoing affliction; and lieth down on the ground""."
3791,SECTION XLII.,"And aggrieved at the thought of Vaidehi, the righteous Rāma speedily"
3792,SECTION XLII.,commanded the monkeys to compass the destruction of the enemies. As Rāma
3793,SECTION XLII.,"of untiring deeds said this, the monkeys, filling (the air) with leonine"
3794,SECTION XLII.,"roars, began to press forward furiously. ""We shall cleave Lankā with"
3795,SECTION XLII.,"mountain-peaks, or with our blows""—thus thought the leaders within"
3796,SECTION XLII.,"themselves. And the monkey-leaders stood, raising up gigantic"
3797,SECTION XLII.,"mountain-peaks and tops of mountains, and rooting up various trees. And"
3798,SECTION XLII.,"for doing what was dear unto Rāma, that army, divided into separate"
3799,SECTION XLII.,"parties, in the presence of the Rākshasa-chief commenced scaling Lankā."
3800,SECTION XLII.,"And those copper-faced ones of golden sheen, who had consecrated their"
3801,SECTION XLII.,"lives to the service of Rāma, equipped with trees and rocks, began to"
3802,SECTION XLII.,throng upon Lankā. And the monkeys with trees and hill-tops and blows
3803,SECTION XLII.,crushed countless gates and tops of walls; and they filled the moat
3804,SECTION XLII.,"containing crystal water with dust, tops of crags, straw, and wood. Then"
3805,SECTION XLII.,leaders of thousands and _kotis_ and hundreds of _kotis_ began to scale
3806,SECTION XLII.,"Lankā. And the monkeys crushed golden gateways; and, breaking down gates"
3807,SECTION XLII.,"resembling the tops of the summits of Kailāça, bounded roaring, some"
3808,SECTION XLII.,"towards the wall and some all around. And resembling gigantic elephants,"
3809,SECTION XLII.,"they rushed towards Lankā. ""Victory to the mighty Rāma, and Victory to"
3810,SECTION XLII.,"the exceedingly powerful Lakshmana, and Victory to king Sugriva, who is"
3811,SECTION XLII.,"protected by Rāghava"". Thus shouting, those monkeys, wearing forms at"
3812,SECTION XLII.,"will, sending up roars, rushed amain towards the wall of Lankā. And"
3813,SECTION XLII.,"Viravāhu, Suvāhu, Nala and Panaça—leader of monkeys—breaking (a portion"
3814,SECTION XLII.,"of) the wall, took up their post there. In the meantime, (they) arranged"
3815,SECTION XLII.,"the forces in order of battle. And the strong Kumuda, surrounded by ten"
3816,SECTION XLII.,"_kotis_ of victorious monkeys, stood obstructing the Eastern gate. And"
3817,SECTION XLII.,"for backing him, there remained the monkey, Prasabha, as also the"
3818,SECTION XLII.,"long-armed Panaça, surrounded by monkeys. And obstructing the Southern"
3819,SECTION XLII.,"entrance stood the strong and gallant monkey, Satavali, surrounded by"
3820,SECTION XLII.,"twenty _kotis_. And the strong sire of Tārā, the powerful Sushena,"
3821,SECTION XLII.,"obstructed the Western gate, backed by _kotis_ upon _kotis_ (of"
3822,SECTION XLII.,"monkeys). And obstructing the Northern gate, remained the puissant Rāma"
3823,SECTION XLII.,"himself along with Sumitrā’s son, as well as the king of"
3824,SECTION XLII.,monkeys—Sugriva. And that huge-bodied and dreadful Golāngula—the mighty
3825,SECTION XLII.,"and powerful Gavāksha—surrounded by a _koti_, remained by the side of"
3826,SECTION XLII.,Rāma. And that destroyer of foes—the exceedingly mighty Dhumra of the
3827,SECTION XLII.,"bears of terrific wrath, remained by the side of Rāma—where, surrounded"
3828,SECTION XLII.,"by vigilant counsellors, and bearing a mace in his hand, stood the"
3829,SECTION XLII.,"exceedingly strong Bibhishana, endowed with wonderful powers, in"
3830,SECTION XLII.,"complete panoply. And Gaya, and Gavāksha, and Gavaya, and Sarabha, and"
3831,SECTION XLII.,"Gandhamadana, protected the monkey-army, coursing all around. And then,"
3832,SECTION XLII.,"his soul wrought up with wrath, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—speedily"
3833,SECTION XLII.,"ordered the whole host to sally out. Hearing those words, which came out"
3834,SECTION XLII.,"from Rāvana’s mouth, all of a sudden the night-rangers sent up a"
3835,SECTION XLII.,"dreadful yell. Then awoke the kettle-drums, having moon-like pale"
3836,SECTION XLII.,"faces,—sounded by means of golden sticks. And conchs by hundreds and by"
3837,SECTION XLII.,"thousands, capable of producing loud blares, filled with air proceeding"
3838,SECTION XLII.,"from the mouths of dreadful Rākshasas,—were winded. And with conchs"
3839,SECTION XLII.,"placed in their mouths, those night-rangers, having bodies blue like"
3840,SECTION XLII.,"those of _Cukas_, resembled masses of clouds, with lightning and cranes."
3841,SECTION XLII.,"And, commanded by Rāvana, the troops cheerfully issued forth like the"
3842,SECTION XLII.,onrushing of the mighty main filling all at the time of the universal
3843,SECTION XLII.,"dissolution. And then the monkey-army gave a roar, spreading all around;"
3844,SECTION XLII.,and it seemed as if the sound filled all Malaya with its sides and
3845,SECTION XLII.,"caves. And sounds of conchs, and drums, as well as the leonine shouts of"
3846,SECTION XLII.,"the impetuous (warriors); made the earth, air, and ocean, resound; and"
3847,SECTION XLII.,"these mixed with the roars of elephants, the neighing of steeds, the"
3848,SECTION XLII.,"rattle of the car-wheels, and the tread of the Rākshasas’ feet. And in"
3849,SECTION XLII.,the meantime there commenced a mighty encounter between the Rākshasas
3850,SECTION XLII.,"and the monkeys, like that which took place of yore between the gods and"
3851,SECTION XLII.,"the Asuras. And displaying their prowess, they¹²⁸ began to slaughter"
3852,SECTION XLII.,"monkeys with maces, and darts, and adzes. And the vehement monkeys (on"
3853,SECTION XLII.,their side) slaughtered Rākshasas with trees and tops of crags as well
3854,SECTION XLII.,as with their nails and teeth. And a mighty sound arose of ’Victory unto
3855,SECTION XLII.,"king Sugriva!’ and ’Victory unto thee, O king,’—each army taking the"
3856,SECTION XLII.,name of its king. And then other dreadful Rākshasas that were stationed
3857,SECTION XLII.,"upon the wall, dropping down, pierced the monkeys with darts and"
3858,SECTION XLII.,"_bhindipālas_. And (thereat) the monkeys, flying into fury, descending"
3859,SECTION XLII.,"to the earth and bounding, brought down the Rākshasas with their arms."
3860,SECTION XLII.,And that encounter of the Rākshasas and the monkeys was mighty and
3861,SECTION XLII.,"wonderful, and the ground became wet with flesh and gore."

3863,SECTION XLII.,¹²⁸ Rākshasas.

3866,SECTION XLII.,
3867,SECTION XLIII.,SECTION XLIII.
3868,SECTION XLIII.,
3869,SECTION XLIII.,
3870,SECTION XLIII.,"And as the high-souled monkeys and Rākshasas fought on, their wrath"
3871,SECTION XLIII.,vastly increased at sight of each other’s forces. And furnished with
3872,SECTION XLIII.,steeds in golden trappings; and elephants resembling flames of fire; and
3873,SECTION XLIII.,"cars appearing like (so many) suns; and shining armour,—the valiant"
3874,SECTION XLIII.,"Rākshasas issued, making the ten cardinal points resound. The Rākshasas"
3875,SECTION XLIII.,of terrific exploits were burning for victory on behalf of Rāvana.—And
3876,SECTION XLIII.,"the mighty monkey-army also, eager for victory, darted against the host"
3877,SECTION XLIII.,"of the Rakshas of dreadful deeds. And in the meanwhile, as either party"
3878,SECTION XLIII.,"assailed the other, there took place single combats between the"
3879,SECTION XLIII.,Rākshasas and the monkeys. And as Andhaka had combated with the
3880,SECTION XLIII.,"Three-eyed (deity)¹²⁹ that Rākshasa, the exceedingly energetic Indrajit,"
3881,SECTION XLIII.,"fought with Angada, son unto Vāli. Sampati, hard to bear, engaged with"
3882,SECTION XLIII.,"Prajangha; and the monkey, Hanumān, entered into conflict with"
3883,SECTION XLIII.,"Jambumāli. And Rāvana’s younger brother, Bibhishana, fired with wrath,"
3884,SECTION XLIII.,"encountered Satrughna, endowed with exceeding impetuosity. And the"
3885,SECTION XLIII.,highly powerful Nila engaged with Nikumbha. And Sugriva—lord of
3886,SECTION XLIII.,"monkeys—undertook Praghasa, and the graceful Lakshmana was engaged with"
3887,SECTION XLIII.,Virupāksha. And the exceedingly irrepressible Agniketu and the
3888,SECTION XLIII.,"Rākshasa—Raçmiketu—and Mitraghna and Yajnakopa, were engaged with Rāma."
3889,SECTION XLIII.,"And Vajramubhthi encountered Mainda, and Açaniprabha, Dwivida. And those"
3890,SECTION XLIII.,"foremost of monkeys fought with those dreadful Rākshasas,—the heroic and"
3891,SECTION XLIII.,"terrible Pratapana, incapable of being overcome in battle, was combating"
3892,SECTION XLIII.,"with Nala of terrific force; and that lusty son of Righteousness,"
3893,SECTION XLIII.,"well-known as Sushena,—a mighty monkey—battled with Vidyunmāli. And"
3894,SECTION XLIII.,other fearful monkeys encountered other Rākshasas; and many were the
3895,SECTION XLIII.,encounters that took place. And great and fierce was the engagement that
3896,SECTION XLIII.,"took place between the heroic Rākshasas and monkeys burning for victory,"
3897,SECTION XLIII.,capable of making people’s hair stand on end. And from the persons of
3898,SECTION XLIII.,"the Rākshasas and the monkeys there flowed a river of gore, having hair"
3899,SECTION XLIII.,"for grass (growing on its banks), and the bodies of the warriors for"
3900,SECTION XLIII.,"pieces of planks floating (adown the current). Indrajit, growing"
3901,SECTION XLIII.,"enraged, with his mace dealt a blow at that tearer of hostile ranks,"
3902,SECTION XLIII.,"Angada,—like him of an hundred sacrifices striking with his thunderbolt."
3903,SECTION XLIII.,"Thereat, that graceful monkey, Angada, gifted with vehemence, with his"
3904,SECTION XLIII.,"mace crushed his car decked in gold, together with the steeds and the"
3905,SECTION XLIII.,charioteer. Sampāti was pierced with three arrows by Prajangha; and the
3906,SECTION XLIII.,former (in his turn) slew Prajangha on the edge of battle with an
3907,SECTION XLIII.,"Açwakarna.¹³⁰ And Jambumāli, mounted on a car, possessed of prodigious"
3908,SECTION XLIII.,"strength, fired with wrath, with all the access of force derived from"
3909,SECTION XLIII.,"his car, wounded Hanumān between his paps. Thereat, getting at his car,"
3910,SECTION XLIII.,Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god—with a slap speedily crushed his
3911,SECTION XLIII.,"adversary’s vehicle along with the Raksha. Then the terrific Pratapana,"
3912,SECTION XLIII.,"roaring, rushed at Nala; and thereat Nala, with his body pierced with"
3913,SECTION XLIII.,"sharp shafts by that swift-handed Raksha, plucked out Pratapana’s eyes,"
3914,SECTION XLIII.,"and cast them to the earth. And that lord of monkeys, Sugriva, with a"
3915,SECTION XLIII.,"_Saptaparna_¹³¹ swiftly slew Praghasa, who appeared to be devouring up"
3916,SECTION XLIII.,"the troops. And, tormenting the Rākshasa of dreadful form with a shower"
3917,SECTION XLIII.,"of shafts, Lakshmana slew Virupāksha with a single arrow. And the"
3918,SECTION XLIII.,"irrepressible Agniketu, the Rākshasa Ragmiketu, Mitraghna and Yajnakopa,"
3919,SECTION XLIII.,"with their arrows rendered Rāma aflame. Thereat, Rāma, growing wroth, in"
3920,SECTION XLIII.,"battle severed the heads of those four by means of four shafts,"
3921,SECTION XLIII.,"dreadful, and resembling the tongues of a flame. And Vajramushti was"
3922,SECTION XLIII.,slain in conflict by Mainda with a clenched fist; and down came he to
3923,SECTION XLIII.,"the ground along with his car and horses, like a turret toppling"
3924,SECTION XLIII.,(headlong). And Nikumbha in fight wounded Nila resembling a mass of blue
3925,SECTION XLIII.,"collyrium, with sharpened shafts,—as the Sun pierceth clouds with his"
3926,SECTION XLIII.,"rays. Again with an hundred arrows, that light-handed night-ranger"
3927,SECTION XLIII.,"pierced Nila in the field; and Nikumbha laughed thereat. At this, even"
3928,SECTION XLIII.,"as Vishnu did in battle, Nila with a wheel of his¹³² car, cut off in"
3929,SECTION XLIII.,conflict Nikumbha’s head together with that of his charioteer. And
3930,SECTION XLIII.,"Dwivida, possessed of the touch of the Vajra and thunder-bolt, in the"
3931,SECTION XLIII.,presence of the entire Rākshasa host hurled a mountain-peak at him that
3932,SECTION XLIII.,was endowed with the splendour of the thunder-bolt. And Açaniprabha in
3933,SECTION XLIII.,"encounter pierced that foremost of monkeys, Dwivida, with shafts"
3934,SECTION XLIII.,"resembling thunder-bolts. Thereat, beside himself with wrath, with his"
3935,SECTION XLIII.,"entire body wounded with arrows, Dwivida with a _sāla_ destroyed"
3936,SECTION XLIII.,"Açaniprabha along with his car and horses. And Vidyunmali, mounted on a"
3937,SECTION XLIII.,"car, assailed Sushena with shafts decked with gold, and began to shout"
3938,SECTION XLIII.,"momentarily. Seeing him mounted on his car, Sushena—best of"
3939,SECTION XLIII.,"monkeys—taking up a huge crag, swiftly brought his car down to the"
3940,SECTION XLIII.,"ground. Thereat, endowed with lightness, that night-ranger, Vidyunmāli,"
3941,SECTION XLIII.,"at once extricating himself from his car, stood on the ground with a"
3942,SECTION XLIII.,"mace in his hand. Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys, Sushena, growing"
3943,SECTION XLIII.,"furious, taking up a gigantic crag, rushed at the night-ranger. And as"
3944,SECTION XLIII.,"he was descending, the night-ranger, Vidyunmāli, with his mace swiftly"
3945,SECTION XLIII.,"hit at the breast of Sushena—greatest of monkeys. Thereat, without"
3946,SECTION XLIII.,"thinking at all of the terrific hit of the mace, that best of monkeys in"
3947,SECTION XLIII.,"mighty conflict brought down that¹³³ upon his¹³⁴ head. And, assailed"
3948,SECTION XLIII.,"with the crag, the night-ranger, Vidyunmāli, having his chest crushed,"
3949,SECTION XLIII.,"fell down to the earth, deprived of life. And, like the celestials"
3950,SECTION XLIII.,"warring against the Daityas, the heroic monkeys warred on and confounded"
3951,SECTION XLIII.,"the valiant rangers of the night. And frightful was the field of battle,"
3952,SECTION XLIII.,"with darts, and other arms; and clubs, and javelins, and lances, and"
3953,SECTION XLIII.,"other weapons; and with broken cars, and war-horses, and mad horses"
3954,SECTION XLIII.,"slain, and monkeys and Rākshasas; and wheels and _akshas_,¹³⁵ and yokes"
3955,SECTION XLIII.,"and standards,—broken and scattered over the ground; and swarms of"
3956,SECTION XLIII.,jackals began to range on all sides of the monkeys and the Rākshasas;
3957,SECTION XLIII.,"and _Kavandhas_¹³⁶ began to rise in that terrific encounter, resembling"
3958,SECTION XLIII.,the encounter of the gods and the Asuras. Thus destroyed by the foremost
3959,SECTION XLIII.,"of monkeys, the rangers of night, beyond themselves with the smell of"
3960,SECTION XLIII.,"blood,—eagerly wishing for the setting of the Sun,¹³⁷ again made active"

3989,SECTION XLIV.,"dreadful Rākshasas and the monkeys of fixed hostility, each party"
3990,SECTION XLIV.,"burning for victory. And in that profound darknesss, the monkeys and the"
3991,SECTION XLIV.,"Rākshasas began to slay each other, exclaiming,—’Thou art a Rākshasa,’"
3992,SECTION XLIV.,and ’Thou art a monkey.’ And in that army there was heard a mighty
3993,SECTION XLIV.,"uproar of ’slain,’ ’rive!’ ’come!’ ’why fliest?’ And, dark-hued, the"
3994,SECTION XLIV.,"Rākshasas, equipped in golden mail, in that deep darkness appeared like"
3995,SECTION XLIV.,elevated hills clad with woods of flaming medicinal herbs. And in that
3996,SECTION XLIV.,"limitless gloom, the Rākshasas, transported with wrath, advanced with"
3997,SECTION XLIV.,"impetuous speed, devouring monkeys. And, fired with terrible wrath,"
3998,SECTION XLIV.,"they,¹³⁸ bounding up, with their sharp teeth tore up steeds caparisoned"
3999,SECTION XLIV.,"in gold, and standards resembling venomous serpents. And the lusty"
4000,SECTION XLIV.,"monkeys in battle agitated the Rākshasa host,—and, waxing furious, with"
4001,SECTION XLIV.,"their teeth pulled and bit elephants and the riders thereof, and cars"
4002,SECTION XLIV.,furnished with flags and standards. And Rāma and Lakshmana with shafts
4003,SECTION XLIV.,"resembling venomous serpents, slaughtered the foremost among the"
4004,SECTION XLIV.,Rākshasas—both those that were seen and those that were not.—And the
4005,SECTION XLIV.,"dust of the earth arising from warring combatants, and from the hoofs of"
4006,SECTION XLIV.,"horses and the wheels of cars, choked up eye and ear. And as the mighty"
4007,SECTION XLIV.,"encounter, capable of making people’s hair stand on end, went on, there"
4008,SECTION XLIV.,flowed a fearful river of gore. And the sounds of kettle-drums and
4009,SECTION XLIV.,"_Mridangas_ and _Panavas_, mingled with those of conchs and"
4010,SECTION XLIV.,"car-wheels,—were wonderful (to hear). And the sounds of steeds neighing,"
4011,SECTION XLIV.,"and Rākshasas (roaring), and monkeys, rejoicing,—were something"
4012,SECTION XLIV.,"tremendous. And, with able monkeys slain; and darts and javelins and"
4013,SECTION XLIV.,"axes; and slaughtered Rākshasas wearing forms at pleasure, lying"
4014,SECTION XLIV.,"mountain-like,—the field of battle, seeming to have offerings of arms"
4015,SECTION XLIV.,"representing flowers,—became difficult to recognise, and inaccessible;"
4016,SECTION XLIV.,"and the earth was drenched with streams of blood. And that Night,"
4017,SECTION XLIV.,"destructive to monkeys and Rākshasas,—was dreadful, and difficult of"
4018,SECTION XLIV.,"being out-sped by all,—like unto the Fatal Night of beings. And in that"
4019,SECTION XLIV.,"profound darkness, the Rākshasas with great vivacity attacked Rāma with"
4020,SECTION XLIV.,"a shower of shafts. And the roars of those beings as they advanced,"
4021,SECTION XLIV.,"sending up shouts in anger, resembled the dashing of the Ocean at the"
4022,SECTION XLIV.,"time of the universal dissolution. And in the twinkling of an eye, Rāma"
4023,SECTION XLIV.,"by means of six shafts resembling tongues of flames, struck six of the"
4024,SECTION XLIV.,"night-rangers; _viz_., Yajnaçatru, irrepressible (in fight),—and"
4025,SECTION XLIV.,"Mahāpārcwa, and Mahodara, and the huge-bodied Vajradanashtra,—and those"
4026,SECTION XLIV.,"two—Suka and Sārana. And, pierced in their vitals with Rāma’s shafts,"
4027,SECTION XLIV.,"they, having only their lives left to them, disappeared from the field."
4028,SECTION XLIV.,"Then in the twinkling of an eye, that Mahāratha rendered all sides clear"
4029,SECTION XLIV.,(of all gloom) by means of arrows resembling tongues of fire; and those
4030,SECTION XLIV.,"other heroic Rākshasas that were in front of Rāma, were destroyed on"
4031,SECTION XLIV.,"approaching the place, like insects approaching a fire. And with shafts"
4032,SECTION XLIV.,"plated with gold lying in all directions, the night resembled one in"
4033,SECTION XLIV.,autumn decked with fireflies. And in consequence of the uproar
4034,SECTION XLIV.,"occasioned by the Rākshasas, and the sounds of drums, that night,"
4035,SECTION XLIV.,"already dreadful (in itself), became all the more so. And on that sound"
4036,SECTION XLIV.,"attaining dimensions on all sides, it seemed as if the mount Trikuta,"
4037,SECTION XLIV.,"containing numerous caverns, had been speaking. And huge-bodied"
4038,SECTION XLIV.,"Goāngulas of equal lustre with darkness itself,¹³⁹ binding fast the"
4039,SECTION XLIV.,"night-rangers with their arms, began to swallow them up. And Angada was"
4040,SECTION XLIV.,"present in the encounter, for slaying foes, And Indrajit, fairing sadly"
4041,SECTION XLIV.,"at the hands of Angada, abandoning his vehicle, and having his horses as"
4042,SECTION XLIV.,"well as his charioteer slain, vanished then and there. And that feat of"
4043,SECTION XLIV.,"Vāli’s son, worthy of being honored, all the celestials with the saints"
4044,SECTION XLIV.,and both Rāma and Lakshmana lauded to the eight. All beings were
4045,SECTION XLIV.,"acquainted with the might of Indrajit in battle; and, therefore,"
4046,SECTION XLIV.,"witnessing his discomfiture, and seeing that high-souled one, they"
4047,SECTION XLIV.,"rejoiced exceedingly, and, seeing the enemy vanquished, all the monkeys"
4048,SECTION XLIV.,"with Sugriva and Bibhishana, experiencing high delight,"
4049,SECTION XLIV.,"exclaimed,—""Excellent!"" ""Excellent!"" And, beaten by Vāli’s son of"
4050,SECTION XLIV.,"dreadful deeds, Indrajit was fired with a mighty wrath. And, being"
4051,SECTION XLIV.,"handled hard in battle, and having vanished from the field, the heroic"
4052,SECTION XLIV.,"and wicked son of Rāvana, who had received a boon from Brahmā,"
4053,SECTION XLIV.,"transported with passion,—remaining invisible, began to discharge"
4054,SECTION XLIV.,sharpened shafts of the splendour of the thunder-bolt. And worked up
4055,SECTION XLIV.,"into rage, he in the conflict pierced Raghu’s sons, Rāma and Lakshmana"

4057,SECTION XLIV.,"himself engirt with illusion, that night-ranger, given to fighting in"

4059,SECTION XLIV.,descendants of Raghu in battle; and by means of his shafts bound the
4060,SECTION XLIV.,"brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana. And then in the sight of the monkeys,"
4061,SECTION XLIV.,those heroes and foremost of men were suddenly overpowered with shafts
4062,SECTION XLIV.,by the enraged (Indrajit). And when the son of the Rākshasa monarch felt

4077,SECTION XLV.,"Then, anxious to ascertain his¹⁴¹ course, the kings son possessed of"
4078,SECTION XLV.,"prowess, and endowed with exceeding strength, Rāma, ordered ten of the"
4079,SECTION XLV.,"monkey-leaders. And that repressor of foes ordered Vāli’s son—Angada,"
4080,SECTION XLV.,"the vigorous Sarabha, Dwivida, Hanumān, the mighty Sānuprastha, Rishabha"
4081,SECTION XLV.,"and Rishabhaskandha. Thereat with alacrity those monkeys, weilding"
4082,SECTION XLV.,"mighty trees, shot up into the sky, and began to scour the ten cardinal"
4083,SECTION XLV.,"points. And Rāvana’s son, skilled in arms, resisted the impetuous march"
4084,SECTION XLV.,of those vehement ones by means of a powerful weapon as well as arms
4085,SECTION XLV.,more forceful (than the force of their rush). And the exceedingly
4086,SECTION XLV.,"vehement monkeys, cut and mangled with _nārāchas_, saw him in the dark"
4087,SECTION XLV.,"like the sun enveloped in clouds. And that conquerer in battle, Rāvana’s"
4088,SECTION XLV.,"son, with shafts sorely pierced the persons of Rāma and Lakshmana. And"
4089,SECTION XLV.,both Rāma and Lakshmana had their bodies entirely covered by the angry
4090,SECTION XLV.,Indrajit with shafts turned into serpents. And from their wounds blood
4091,SECTION XLV.,began to gush out in streams; and they looked like flower-crowned
4092,SECTION XLV.,_Kinçukas_. Then that one having red corners unto his eyes and
4093,SECTION XLV.,"resembling a mass of crushed collyrium, Rāvana’s son, said unto the"
4094,SECTION XLV.,"brothers, as he vanished,—""When I fight remaining invisible, even"
4095,SECTION XLV.,"Sakra—the lord of the celestials—cannot see or approach me,—and who are"
4096,SECTION XLV.,"ye? And I, with my soul surcharged with wrath, shall, assailing them"
4097,SECTION XLV.,"with showers of weapons furnished with Kanka feathers, send Raghu’s sons"
4098,SECTION XLV.,"to the abode of Yama"". Having spoken thus unto the brothers—Rāma and"
4099,SECTION XLV.,"Lakshmana, cognizant of righteousness—(Indrajit)—pierced them with"
4100,SECTION XLV.,"sharpened shafts, and shouted in joy. And stretching his large bow, that"
4101,SECTION XLV.,one sable like unto a mass of crushed collyrium again discharged
4102,SECTION XLV.,terrific shafts in battle. And that one versed in the inner sense of
4103,SECTION XLV.,"things, with whetted arrows pierced the vitals of Rāma and Lakshmana and"
4104,SECTION XLV.,shouted momentarily. And fast bound by the shackles of shafts on the
4105,SECTION XLV.,"edge of battle, they¹⁴² could not attain respite for a moment. Then with"
4106,SECTION XLV.,"their persons pierced with shafts and darts, and resembling the flags of"
4107,SECTION XLV.,"the Great Indra let loose from the cords and trembling (in the air),—and"
4108,SECTION XLV.,"with their bodies bristling with arrows,—those heroes and mighty"
4109,SECTION XLV.,bowmen—lords of the earth—tormented in consequence of their vitals
4110,SECTION XLV.,"having been pierced, dropped down to the earth. And those heroes, bathed"
4111,SECTION XLV.,"in blood, and their persons covered with arrows,—pained and suffering"
4112,SECTION XLV.,"terribly, lay down as became heroes. And there was not so much room"
4113,SECTION XLV.,unpierced in their persons as could be measured by a finger; and they
4114,SECTION XLV.,were wounded with arrows up to the fore-parts of their hands.¹⁴³ And
4115,SECTION XLV.,"they being wounded by that fell one capable of assuming shapes at will,"
4116,SECTION XLV.,blood violently gushed out of their bodies like water from a spring. And
4117,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma fell first, pierced in the vitals with the shafts. And the same"
4118,SECTION XLV.,Indrajit who had formerly wrathfully routed Sakra.(now) pierced (Rāma)
4119,SECTION XLV.,"with _nārāchas_ knotted with gold, and having polished heads;"
4120,SECTION XLV.,swift-speeding; and resembling dust carried about by the wind; and
4121,SECTION XLV.,half-_nārāchas_; and darts resembling _anjalis_;¹⁴⁴ and
4122,SECTION XLV.,"_vatsadantas_;¹⁴⁵ and _sinhadanshtras_;¹⁴⁶ and razors; and, resigning"
4123,SECTION XLV.,"his stringless bow decked in gold and curved in three places,—with its"
4124,SECTION XLV.,part for grasping shattered—he¹⁴⁷ lay down like a hero. And seeing
4125,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma—foremost of men—down within arrow-range, Lakshmana despaired of his"
4126,SECTION XLV.,"life. And seeing his brother, Rāma, having eyes resembling lotus-petals"
4127,SECTION XLV.,"and ever delighting in battle, himself the refuge of others,—lying down"
4128,SECTION XLV.,"in the field; (Lakshmana) began to weep. And the monkeys also, seeing"
4129,SECTION XLV.,"him, were plunged in sorrow; and they, their eyes flooded with tears,"
4130,SECTION XLV.,began to cry in grief of heart. And when they had been bound and had
4131,SECTION XLV.,"laid themselves down as become heroes, the monkeys stood around"
4132,SECTION XLV.,"them,—and, conversing with one another, they, headed by the son of the"

4158,SECTION XLVI.,"work, like the God¹⁴⁸ going away, after having showered,—there came to"
4159,SECTION XLVI.,"that place Bibhishana with Sugriva. And, mourning Raghu’s sons, there"
4160,SECTION XLVI.,also came in all haste Nila and Dwivida and Mainda and Sushena and
4161,SECTION XLVI.,Kumuda and Angada in company with Hanumān. And moveless; breathing
4162,SECTION XLVI.,"low,—covered with blood,—pierced all over with net-works of shafts;"
4163,SECTION XLVI.,dumb; they¹⁴⁹ were lying on the field. And they were sighing like
4164,SECTION XLVI.,serpents; and were inert; and deprived of prowess; and washed in blood;
4165,SECTION XLVI.,"and looking like unto golden standards. And as they lay moveless, as"
4166,SECTION XLVI.,"become heroes, the leaders of monkeys environed them with tear-charged"
4167,SECTION XLVI.,"eyes. And seeing the sons of Raghu lying, covered with showers of"
4168,SECTION XLVI.,"shafts, the monkeys, with Bibhishana, were pained (exceedingly). And the"
4169,SECTION XLVI.,"monkeys, surveying the sky as well as all directions, could not see"
4170,SECTION XLVI.,Rāvana’s son in battle enveloped with illusion. And then Bibhishana by
4171,SECTION XLVI.,"means of illusion saw his brother’s son staying before, hidden by"
4172,SECTION XLVI.,"illusion. And Bibhishana saw that hero of incomparable deeds, who had no"
4173,SECTION XLVI.,"compeer in the field and who had energy, fame and prowess,—as he"
4174,SECTION XLVI.,remained invisible in consequence of the Boon received from Brahma. And
4175,SECTION XLVI.,"Indrajit, seeing his own feat and them lying at length, spake in excess"
4176,SECTION XLVI.,"of joy, gladdening all the Rākshasas,—""The brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana,"
4177,SECTION XLVI.,"possessed of great strength, who had slain Khara and Dushana, are"
4178,SECTION XLVI.,themselves slain with my shafts. And all the celestials and Asuras
4179,SECTION XLVI.,"assembled together with the saints, are incompetent to emancipate these"
4180,SECTION XLVI.,from the fetters of my shafts. He for whom my father was exercised with
4181,SECTION XLVI.,"anxiety and tormented by grief, for whom my sire used to spend nights"
4182,SECTION XLVI.,"without pressing his bed,—for whom this entire Lankā had resembled a"
4183,SECTION XLVI.,"river turbulent in the rainy reason,—that same evil sticking by the root"
4184,SECTION XLVI.,"of all, hath been dispensed his quietus by me. And like clouds of"
4185,SECTION XLVI.,"autumn, the prowess of Rāma and Lakshmana as well as that of all the"
4186,SECTION XLVI.,"rangers of the woods, hath been rendered useless"". Saying this in the"
4187,SECTION XLVI.,"presence of all the Rākshasas, Rāvana’s son—destroyer of foes—menacing"
4188,SECTION XLVI.,"the monkey-leaders, hit Nila with nine arrows, and hurt Mainda and"
4189,SECTION XLVI.,Dwivida each with three powerful shafts. And piercing Jambavān with an
4190,SECTION XLVI.,"arrow in the chest, that mighty bowman discharged ten at Hanumān. And"
4191,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāvana’s son possessed of exceeding impetuosity, pierced in the conflict"
4192,SECTION XLVI.,with two shafts each Gavāksha and Sarabha of immeasurable vigor. And
4193,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāvana’s son, summoning celerity, pierced the king of Golangulas and"
4194,SECTION XLVI.,"Vāli’s son, Angada, with innumerable arrows. And the powerful son of"
4195,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāvana, endowed with might, piercing the foremost monkeys with shafts"
4196,SECTION XLVI.,"resembling tongues of flames, set up shouts in the field of battle. And"
4197,SECTION XLVI.,tormenting the monkeys with volleys of shafts and striking terror into
4198,SECTION XLVI.,"them, that mighty-armed one, bursting out into a laugh, said,—""Let the"
4199,SECTION XLVI.,"Rākshasas behold these brothers, lying fast bound with dreadful arrows,"
4200,SECTION XLVI.,"in front of the forces"". Thus addressed, those Rākshasas—wily warriors"
4201,SECTION XLVI.,"all—resembling masses of clouds, witnessing that deed (of Indrajit),"
4202,SECTION XLVI.,"struck with wonder and rejoicing (greatly), set up tremendous roars. And"
4203,SECTION XLVI.,"thinking that Rāma was slain, they honored Rāvana’s son. And seeing the"
4204,SECTION XLVI.,"brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—motionless, and lying inert on the"
4205,SECTION XLVI.,"ground,—they took them for slain. And, experiencing excess of joy,"
4206,SECTION XLVI.,"Indrajit—conquerer in conflict—entered the city of Lankā, rejoicing all"
4207,SECTION XLVI.,the Nairitas. Seeing the bodies as well as the limbs of Rāma and
4208,SECTION XLVI.,"Lakshmana, covered entirely with arrows, fear took possession of"
4209,SECTION XLVI.,"Sugriva. Thereat Bibhishana said unto that lord of monkeys, staying in"
4210,SECTION XLVI.,"woe begone guise, with a tearful countenance, and his eyes wild with"
4211,SECTION XLVI.,"wrath,—""Do not give way to fear, O Sugriva. Restrain thy rising tears!"
4212,SECTION XLVI.,"This is the way of warfare: victory is not (always) sure. But, O hero,"
4213,SECTION XLVI.,"if Fortune ultimately smile upon us, this stupor shall go off from these"
4214,SECTION XLVI.,"high-souled and exceedingly powerful ones. Therefore, O monkey, do thou"
4215,SECTION XLVI.,"cheer me, who am forlorn"". Saying this, with his hand Bibhishana washed"
4216,SECTION XLVI.,"Sugriva’s graceful eyes with water. And taking water, the righteous"
4217,SECTION XLVI.,"Bibhishana by means of his knowledge, washed Sugriva’s eyes therewith."
4218,SECTION XLVI.,"And washing the face of the intelligent monkey-monarch, Bibhishana spoke"
4219,SECTION XLVI.,"these words, seasonable and sedate,—""O foremost of monkey-kings, this is"
4220,SECTION XLVI.,"no time for being overcome with stupor. At this hour, even immoderate"
4221,SECTION XLVI.,"affection may lead to destruction. Therefore, casting off stupor, which"
4222,SECTION XLVI.,"tends to mar all work, do thou bethink thee how thou mayst serve this"
4223,SECTION XLVI.,army headed by Rāma. Or do thou protect Rāma so long as he doth not
4224,SECTION XLVI.,regain consciousness; and when the Kākutsthas shall have regained
4225,SECTION XLVI.,"consciousness, all our apprehension shall vanish. This is nothing to"
4226,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāma, and Rāma is not dying. And Lakshmi,¹⁵⁰ who is incapable of being"
4227,SECTION XLVI.,"attained by those that are doomed, shall not forsake this one. Therefore"
4228,SECTION XLVI.,"do thou comfort thyself, do thou also cheer up thy own forces,—while I"
4229,SECTION XLVI.,"am engaged in composing all the troops. O best of monkeys, these with"
4230,SECTION XLVI.,"distended eyes, come under the governance of terror, are, stricken with"
4231,SECTION XLVI.,"panic, whispering into each other’s ears. But seeing me, let the forces"
4232,SECTION XLVI.,"rushing about, cheered up,—as well as the monkeys,—cast off all fear,"
4233,SECTION XLVI.,"like a wreath that hath been used before"". Thus comforting Sugriva,"
4234,SECTION XLVI.,Bibhishana—lord of Rākshasas—again instilled spirits into the flying
4235,SECTION XLVI.,forces of monkeys. And Indrajit—worker of mighty illusions—accompanied
4236,SECTION XLVI.,"by his troops, entered the city of Lankā and presented himself before"
4237,SECTION XLVI.,"his father. And approaching Rāvana and saluting him with joined hands,"
4238,SECTION XLVI.,he informed his sire of the welcome tidings that Rāma and Lakshmana had
4239,SECTION XLVI.,"been slain. And hearing that his foe had fallen, Rāvana springing up in"
4240,SECTION XLVI.,"the midst of the Rākshasas, with great joy embraced his son. And"
4241,SECTION XLVI.,"scenting the crown of his head, (Rāvana) with a delighted heart, asked"
4242,SECTION XLVI.,"(Indrajit as to all that had taken place). And on being asked, he"
4243,SECTION XLVI.,(Indrajit) truly related unto his sire how (Rāma and Lakshmana) had been
4244,SECTION XLVI.,rendered senseless and lack-lustre by being fastened with shafts.
4245,SECTION XLVI.,"Thereat, with rapture surcharging his inmost soul, Rāvana, hearing the"
4246,SECTION XLVI.,"speech of the mighty car-warrior, banished his fear of Daçaratha’s"

4267,SECTION XLVII.,"awry and upwards; and even when a straw stirred, they thought it to be a"
4268,SECTION XLVII.,"Rākshasa. And Rāvana, on his part, experiencing the height of"
4269,SECTION XLVII.,"exaltation, summoned the Rakshasis engaged in guarding Sitā.—And thereat"
4270,SECTION XLVII.,the Rakshasis—Trijata and others—presented themselves at his command.
4271,SECTION XLVII.,"And then the lord of Rākshasas, delighted, addressed then the Rakshasis,"
4272,SECTION XLVII.,"saying,—""Tell Vaidehi that Rāma and Lakshmana have been slain in battle"
4273,SECTION XLVII.,"by Indrajit. And taking her on Pushaka, show her (Rāma and Lakshmana)"
4274,SECTION XLVII.,lying slain on the field of battle. That one depending on whom she had
4275,SECTION XLVII.,"proudly set her face against me,—that husband of hers, along with his"
4276,SECTION XLVII.,"brother, hath been slain in conflict. And then Mithila’s daughter, her"
4277,SECTION XLVII.,"fear gone off with her anxiety, and herself losing all"
4278,SECTION XLVII.,"support,—Sitā—daughter unto Mithila—decked out in all ornaments, shall"
4279,SECTION XLVII.,"seek me. And today beholding Rāma with Lakshmana, come under the sway of"
4280,SECTION XLVII.,"Time, she, finding no other way, shall desist from her present course."
4281,SECTION XLVII.,"And seeing no other resourse, that one of expansive eyes shall of"
4282,SECTION XLVII.,"herself seek me"". Hearing those words of the wicked-minded Rāvana, the"
4283,SECTION XLVII.,"Rakshasis, saying,—""So be it,""—went to where Pushpaka was. Then taking"
4284,SECTION XLVII.,"Pushpaka, the Rakshasis at Rāvana’s command went to Maithili staying in"
4285,SECTION XLVII.,"the _açoka_ wood. Then, taking Sitā, who was overcome with grief for her"
4286,SECTION XLVII.,"lord, the Rakshasis, placed her on the car, Pushpaka. And placing Sitā"
4287,SECTION XLVII.,"on Pushpaka along with Trijata, Rāvana took her all around (Lankā)"
4288,SECTION XLVII.,crowded with ensigns and standards. And the lord of Rākshasas jubilantly
4289,SECTION XLVII.,"proclaimed in Lankā,—""Rāghava as well as Lakshmana have been slain by"
4290,SECTION XLVII.,"Indrajit in battle"". And going about with Trijata, Sitā saw all the"

4292,SECTION XLVII.,and the monkeys afflicted with extreme grief at the side of Rāma and
4293,SECTION XLVII.,"Lakshmana. Then Sitā beheld both Lakshmana and Rāma lying in the field,"

4295,SECTION XLVII.,"earth, their mail torn, their bows cast off, their bodies mangled all"

4317,SECTION XLVIII.,"should never be a widow. But on Rāma being slain, it seems now that"
4318,SECTION XLVIII.,"those ones, possessed of knowledge, had spoken untruthfully. And those"
4319,SECTION XLVIII.,"also, who having celebrated sacrifices and rites, had said that I should"
4320,SECTION XLVIII.,"become the queen (of Rāma),—on Rāma being slain, seems to-day to have"
4321,SECTION XLVIII.,"spoken a falsehood, although they are possessed of knowledge. And they"
4322,SECTION XLVIII.,also asserted that I should be honored of the wives of heroic kings as
4323,SECTION XLVIII.,"well as of my lord,—but on Rāma being slain, they seem to have uttered a"
4324,SECTION XLVIII.,"falsehood, although possessed of knowledge. And those twice-born ones"
4325,SECTION XLVIII.,"that in my hearing had said auspicious words, on Rāma being slain, seem"
4326,SECTION XLVIII.,"to-day to have spoken a falsehood, although they were possessed of"
4327,SECTION XLVIII.,"knowledge. These lotus-marks on the feet, betokening unto gentlewomen"
4328,SECTION XLVIII.,"possessing them, that they are to be installed in the kingdom in company"
4329,SECTION XLVIII.,"with their husbands—who are kings,—are on me. And those marks find I"
4330,SECTION XLVIII.,"none on me by which women of rare fortune come by widowhood,—but I find"
4331,SECTION XLVIII.,that in me these good tokens are nullified. Those marks that are
4332,SECTION XLVIII.,"pronounced infallible by those versed in such knowledge, on Rāma being"
4333,SECTION XLVIII.,"slain, are nullified in me. My hairs are fine, equal, and blue; my"
4334,SECTION XLVIII.,eye-brows touch each other; my hips are devoid of down and round; and my
4335,SECTION XLVIII.,"teeth are close. My temples, and eyes, hands, feet, ankles, and thighs"
4336,SECTION XLVIII.,"are equal. And my fingers are furnished with round nails, and are plump"
4337,SECTION XLVIII.,"and even in the middle. And my breasts are close and firm and developed,"
4338,SECTION XLVIII.,"and have their nipples sunk. And my navel is depressed, with high sides."
4339,SECTION XLVIII.,"And my chest is swelling. And my complexion is like the hue of gems,—and"
4340,SECTION XLVIII.,my down soft. And they said that I was furnished with twelve auspicious
4341,SECTION XLVIII.,signs. And my hands in the middle parts of my fingers contain
4342,SECTION XLVIII.,"wheat-marks; and in the spaces between the fingers, have no uneven"
4343,SECTION XLVIII.,corners. And my feet also partake of the general complexion. And my
4344,SECTION XLVIII.,laugh is a gentle smile. And those versed in marks of women knew that I
4345,SECTION XLVIII.,was possessed of such marks. And those Brāhmanas skilled in telling
4346,SECTION XLVIII.,fortune said that I should be installed in the kingdom along with my
4347,SECTION XLVIII.,husband; but all that hath been falsified. Having purified Janasthāna
4348,SECTION XLVIII.,"(of Rākshasas), obtained tidings of me, and crossed the Ocean¹⁵²"
4349,SECTION XLVIII.,"incapable of being Agitated, those brothers have been slain in the"
4350,SECTION XLVIII.,footprint of a cow! The descendants of Raghu had obtained Vāruua and
4351,SECTION XLVIII.,Agneya and Aindra and Vāyava and _Brahmaçiras_ weapons.¹⁵³ Through
4352,SECTION XLVIII.,"illusion have those lords of me, who am forlorn—Rāma and Lakshmana,"
4353,SECTION XLVIII.,"resembling Vāsava himself in battle,—been slain. Coming in battle within"
4354,SECTION XLVIII.,"ken of Rāghava, a foe, even if he be endowed with the fleetness of"
4355,SECTION XLVIII.,"thought,—doth not go back, living. There is nothing which is too hard"
4356,SECTION XLVIII.,for Time; and the Destroyer is incapable of being overcome; inasmuch as
4357,SECTION XLVIII.,Rāma along with his brother Lakshmana hath fallen in fight. And I do not
4358,SECTION XLVIII.,"so much mourn Rāma or the mighty car-warrior—Lakshmana—or, for that"
4359,SECTION XLVIII.,"matter, self,—as I do the wretched Mother-in-law of mine. She ever"
4360,SECTION XLVIII.,thinketh of the period of the promise. ’When shall I behold Sitā and
4361,SECTION XLVIII.,"Lakshmana with Rāghava?’"" As she was thus lamenting, the Rakshasi,"
4362,SECTION XLVIII.,"Trijata, said,—""O exalted lady, do not weep thus. Thy lord liveth. And,"
4363,SECTION XLVIII.,"O dignified one, I shall unfold unto thee potent and probable reasons"
4364,SECTION XLVIII.,"why the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana live. When their leader falleth, the"
4365,SECTION XLVIII.,"countenances of the warriors in battle are not overspread with passion,"
4366,SECTION XLVIII.,"or display cheerfulness and vivacity. And, O Vaidehi, if those had lost"
4367,SECTION XLVIII.,"their lives, this celestial chariot, named Pushpaka, would not have held"
4368,SECTION XLVIII.,thee. An army that hath its heroes and chiefs slain—becoming dispirited
4369,SECTION XLVIII.,"and drooping, rangeth the field, like a vessel on water that hath lost"
4370,SECTION XLVIII.,"its helmsman. But, O lorn one, these troops, betraying neither agitation"

4373,SECTION XLVIII.,and behold the Kākutsthas unslain. This I tell thee from affection. I
4374,SECTION XLVIII.,"never told thee untruths heretofore; nor, O Mithilā’s daughter, will I"
4375,SECTION XLVIII.,tell them unto thee now. Thou by virtue of thy character conducive to
4376,SECTION XLVIII.,"delight, hast found an access into my heart. These even the celestials"
4377,SECTION XLVIII.,and Asuras with Indra (at their head) are incompetent to quell. Seeing
4378,SECTION XLVIII.,"such sight, I speak to thee as to their being alive. And behold, O"
4379,SECTION XLVIII.,"Maithili, this mighty wonder! These are lying insensible with arrows;"
4380,SECTION XLVIII.,but of those Grace hath not taken leave. It generally happens that the
4381,SECTION XLVIII.,"faces of persons dead and gone, are unsightly to a degree. Therefore, O"
4382,SECTION XLVIII.,"Janaka’s daughter, leave off grief and sorrow and stupor. For the sake"
4383,SECTION XLVIII.,of Rāma and Lakshmana thou canst not today put a period to thy
4384,SECTION XLVIII.,"existence"". Hearing her words, Mithila’s daughter—Sitā—resembling the"
4385,SECTION XLVIII.,"daughter of a celestial, with hands joined, said,—""May this be so!"" Then"
4386,SECTION XLVIII.,"turning away the car Pushpaka fleet as the mind, the distressed Sitā"
4387,SECTION XLVIII.,"entered Lankā along with Trijata. Then in company with Trijata,"
4388,SECTION XLVIII.,"alighting from Pushpaka, she along with the Rakshasis entered the"
4389,SECTION XLVIII.,_açoka_ wood. And entering that sporting-ground of the Rākshasa lord
4390,SECTION XLVIII.,"abounding in woody tracts, Sitā, having beheld those princes and"
4391,SECTION XLVIII.,"reflected on them, became subject to a mighty grief."

4405,SECTION XLIX.,"along with Sugriva, possessed of exceeding strength,—overwhelmed with"
4406,SECTION XLIX.,"sorrow, remained surrounding those high-souled ones. In the meanwhile,"
4407,SECTION XLIX.,"the powerful Rāma, albeit fast bound by the shafts, awoke by virtue of"
4408,SECTION XLIX.,"the exceeding toughness of his person, as well as his might. Then,"
4409,SECTION XLIX.,"seeing his brother, having a distressful countenance, covered with"
4410,SECTION XLIX.,"blood, feeble, and fast bound by the shafts,—Rāma, greatly aggrieved,"
4411,SECTION XLIX.,"began to mourn. ""Of what use unto me is the recovery of Sitā, or life"
4412,SECTION XLIX.,"either, when to-day I see my brother vanquished in fight and lying down"
4413,SECTION XLIX.,"in the field? Seeking in the world (of men), I may light upon a woman"
4414,SECTION XLIX.,"like Sitā; but never on a brother, or a helper, or a warrior like unto"
4415,SECTION XLIX.,"Lakshmana. If that enhancer of Sumitrā’s joy have met with his end, my"
4416,SECTION XLIX.,life I must renounce in the sight of the monkeys. What shall I say unto
4417,SECTION XLIX.,Kauçalyā: and what shall I say unto Kaikeyi? And what shall I say unto
4418,SECTION XLIX.,"mother Sumitrā, eager for a sight of her son? And if I go (back) without"
4419,SECTION XLIX.,"him, how shall I soothe her, like unto a cow reft of her calf; and"
4420,SECTION XLIX.,trembling; and resembling a mourning Kurari? And how shall I say unto
4421,SECTION XLIX.,"Satrughana and the illustrious Bharata,—’He went with me to the forest;"
4422,SECTION XLIX.,but I come (back) here without him?’ I shall not be able to bear the
4423,SECTION XLIX.,rebuke of mother Sumitrā. Therefore even here shall I renounce my
4424,SECTION XLIX.,"person; for certainly I dare not live. Fie on me, who am wicked and"
4425,SECTION XLIX.,"base; for me this Lakshmana, brought down, lieth in the field of battle,"
4426,SECTION XLIX.,"like one that is without life. O Lakshmana, thou ever comfortest me when"
4427,SECTION XLIX.,"I am dispirited. But to day, having lost thy life, thou canst not speak"
4428,SECTION XLIX.,"to me, who am afflicted. Thou, O hero, who hadst in battle slain"
4429,SECTION XLIX.,"innumerable Rākshasas lying around, hast (at length) thyself been slain"
4430,SECTION XLIX.,"in the field with shafts. And lying down in the battle-field, bleeding,"
4431,SECTION XLIX.,"and covered with arrows, thou appearest like the Sun when he hath gone"
4432,SECTION XLIX.,"up the Setting-hill. And in consequence of shafts piercing thy vitals,"
4433,SECTION XLIX.,"thou canst not speak; but thy visible expression, albeit thou art dumb,"
4434,SECTION XLIX.,"betokens pain. O thou endowed with exceeding splendour, even as thou"
4435,SECTION XLIX.,"didst follow me into the forest, will I follow thee unto the mansion of"
4436,SECTION XLIX.,"Yama. Thou, having dear friends, and ever following me, hast come by"
4437,SECTION XLIX.,this plight in consequence of my reprehensible conduct. I do not
4438,SECTION XLIX.,"remember having heard any harsh speech from the heroic Lakshmana, even"
4439,SECTION XLIX.,when he had happened to be exceedingly wroth. He that could discharge at
4440,SECTION XLIX.,"one shot five hundred shafts,—that Lakshmana is superior to Kārttaviryya"
4441,SECTION XLIX.,himself in that weapon—the bow. He that with his arms could resist the
4442,SECTION XLIX.,"arms of Sakra himself,—that one worthy of a costly couch—lieth down on"
4443,SECTION XLIX.,"the ground, slain. And that false babble shall now, without doubt,"
4444,SECTION XLIX.,consume me; for by me hath not Bibhishana been made monarch of the
4445,SECTION XLIX.,"Rākshasas. Do thou, O Sugriva, this very moment retrace thy steps."
4446,SECTION XLIX.,"Bereft of thy strength through me, thou wilt be worsted by Rāvana. And,"
4447,SECTION XLIX.,"O Sugriva, placing Angada to the fore, do thou, taking thy host as well"
4448,SECTION XLIX.,"as the equipage, in company with Nila and Nala, cross over the Ocean. By"

4450,SECTION XLIX.,"in battle. And pleased am I with the king of bears, and the lord of"
4451,SECTION XLIX.,"Golāngulas; and Angada hath quit himself nobly, as also Mainda and"
4452,SECTION XLIX.,"Dwivida. And Keçarin and Sampāti have both fought terribly. And Gavaya,"
4453,SECTION XLIX.,"and Gavāksha, and Sarabha, and Gaja,—and other monkeys have fought as"
4454,SECTION XLIX.,"others are incapable of fighting,—determined to lay down their lives"
4455,SECTION XLIX.,"(for me). But, O Sugriva, man cannot overrule Destiny. Thou, my friend,"
4456,SECTION XLIX.,"fearing righteousness,¹⁵⁴ hast done what lay in thy power. And, Ye"
4457,SECTION XLIX.,"foremost of monkeys, ye also have acted as becometh friends. Now, with"
4458,SECTION XLIX.,"my permission, go ye whithersoever ye are minded"". Hearing Rāma’s"
4459,SECTION XLIX.,"lament, the monkeys—those dark-eyed and others—began to shed tears from"
4460,SECTION XLIX.,"their eyes. Then Bibhishana, quieting the army, taking a mace in his"

4462,SECTION XLIX.,"way, resembling a mass of dark collyrium, the monkeys taking him to be"

4482,SECTION L.,car-warrior—Lakshmana—covered with arrows? And (dost thou not see) those
4483,SECTION L.,"high-souled ones lying in the field of battle, covered with blood?"""
4484,SECTION L.,"Thereat, the lord of monkeys, Sugriva, spake unto his son,¹⁵⁶ Angada—""I"
4485,SECTION L.,do not deem it without cause. This may have come to pass through sheer
4486,SECTION L.,"fear. These monkeys with sad faces, leaving their arms behind them, are"
4487,SECTION L.,"flying in all directions, their eyes distended in affright. And they are"
4488,SECTION L.,"not ashamed of each other, and they do not cast their looks back. And"
4489,SECTION L.,"they hug each other, and go leaping over the fallen"". In the meanwhile,"
4490,SECTION L.,"that hero, Bibhishana, bearing a mace in his hand, (approaching),"
4491,SECTION L.,greeted Sugriva as well as Rāghava with blessings of victory. And
4492,SECTION L.,"Sugriva, seeing Bibhishana, capable of inspiring fear in the monkeys,"
4493,SECTION L.,"spoke unto the high-souled sovereign of bears, who stood by,—""This is"
4494,SECTION L.,"Bibhishana that hath come hither, seeing whom the foremost among the"
4495,SECTION L.,"monkeys, from fear of Rāvana’s son who, they apprehend, he is,—are"
4496,SECTION L.,"fleeing away, seized with a panic. Do thou at once stay these agitated"
4497,SECTION L.,"with fear and scampering all around; and proclaim,—’This is"
4498,SECTION L.,"_Bibhishana_, who hath come here.’"" Thus directed, Jāmbavān—king of"
4499,SECTION L.,"bears—restraining those that were flying, composed the monkeys. Hearing"
4500,SECTION L.,"the bear-king’s words, and seeing Bibhishana, the monkeys, renouncing"
4501,SECTION L.,"fear, desisted (from their flight). Then the righteous Bibhishana,"
4502,SECTION L.,"viewing Rāma’s as well as Lakshmana’s body pierced with arrows, was"
4503,SECTION L.,"exceedingly aggrieved. And washing their eyes with water, he, with his"
4504,SECTION L.,"mind overpowered with grief, began to weep and broke out into"
4505,SECTION L.,"lamentation,—""The Rākshasas, fighting in wily ways, have brought to this"
4506,SECTION L.,pass these ones endowed with prowess and possessed of every perfection
4507,SECTION L.,"and gifted with might (of arm). And with his guileful mind, that"
4508,SECTION L.,"brother’s son of mine, wicked-souled and an evil son (unto me),—hath"
4509,SECTION L.,deceived these ones of straight prowess. Pierced with innumerable
4510,SECTION L.,"shafts, and covered with blood, these are lying on the ground like"
4511,SECTION L.,"Salyakas¹⁵⁷. Those depending on whose prowess, I had sought eminence,"
4512,SECTION L.,"those foremost of men, sleep here soundly for renouncing their bodies."
4513,SECTION L.,"Living, today I am in distress: and my desire of dominion is"
4514,SECTION L.,"annihilated; and my foe, Rāvana, hath his promise fulfilled and his aim"
4515,SECTION L.,"crowned with success"". As Bibhishana was thus lamenting, the lord of"
4516,SECTION L.,"monkeys—Sugriva—endowed with strength, embracing him, spoke unto him,—""O"
4517,SECTION L.,"thou cognisant of righteousness, thou wilt herein Lankā obtain empire:"
4518,SECTION L.,no doubt of this; and Rāvana along with his sons will be disappointed in
4519,SECTION L.,their expectations. Both these—Rāma and Lakshmana—are under the _aegis_
4520,SECTION L.,"of Gāruda; and, casting off their stupor: they will in battle slay"
4521,SECTION L.,"Rāvana along with his adherents"". Having thus soothed and comforted the"
4522,SECTION L.,"Rākshasa, Sugriva addressed his father-in-law, who was at his side,"
4523,SECTION L.,"saying,—""Do thou along with numbers of heroic monkeys, taking those"
4524,SECTION L.,"repressors of foes, the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—when they shall have"
4525,SECTION L.,"regained their consciousness, repair to Kishkindhā. And I, slaying"
4526,SECTION L.,"Rāvana along with his sons and friends, shall bring back Mithila’s"
4527,SECTION L.,"daughter, even as Sakra recovered the lost Srī"". Hearing the words of"
4528,SECTION L.,"the monkey-king, Sushena said,—""I had witnessed the war of yore between"
4529,SECTION L.,"the gods and the Asuras. Then the Dānavas, enveloping themselves,"
4530,SECTION L.,"momentarily destroyed the deities, albeit versed in arms and"
4531,SECTION L.,"accomplished in weapons. And they, their senses lost, and their lives"
4532,SECTION L.,"departed, Vrihashpati treated by means of his knowledge of _mantras_, as"
4533,SECTION L.,"well with medicines. Let Sampati, Panaca, and other monkeys speedily hie"
4534,SECTION L.,to the Milky Ocean for the purpose of bringing those medicines. And the
4535,SECTION L.,monkeys well know that mighty mountainous medicine—divine and capable of
4536,SECTION L.,"reviving the dead,—and made by the deities themselves—_viçalyā_. There"
4537,SECTION L.,are (the mountains) named Chandra and Drona: where the ambrosia was
4538,SECTION L.,"churned, there is that supreme drug. And those mountains have been"
4539,SECTION L.,"placed by the deities in the mighty deep. And, O king, let the son of"
4540,SECTION L.,"the Wind-god go thither"". In the meanwhile, the wind arose, and masses"
4541,SECTION L.,"of clouds appeared along with lightning. And the wind blew, agitating"
4542,SECTION L.,"the waters of the deep, and shaking the mountains. And mighty trees of"
4543,SECTION L.,"the ocean-islands, broken down by the terrible wing-raised wind, began"
4544,SECTION L.,to topple headlong into the salt waters. And the serpents dwelling there
4545,SECTION L.,were seized with affright; and speedily all the aquatic animals dived
4546,SECTION L.,deep into the salt sea. And then in a moment the monkeys saw Vinatā’s
4547,SECTION L.,"son, possessed of terrific strength,—like unto a flaming fire. And"
4548,SECTION L.,"seeing him come, the serpents began to dart away,—those exceedingly"
4549,SECTION L.,"powerful ones that, turning into shafts, had bound those persons.¹⁵⁸"
4550,SECTION L.,"Then, touching the Kākutsthas and saluting them, Suparna rubbed with his"
4551,SECTION L.,hands their countenances furnished with the splendour of the Moon. And
4552,SECTION L.,"their wounds, on being touched by Vinatā’s son, were (immediately)"
4553,SECTION L.,healed; and the bodies of both speedily became cool and shone with an
4554,SECTION L.,excellent complexion. And they attained immense energy and prowess; and
4555,SECTION L.,"a double share of strength, and of rational and perceptive powers, and"
4556,SECTION L.,"of memory. And then raising them up, the exceedingly energetic Gāruda,"
4557,SECTION L.,"resembling Vāsava himself, embraced both joyfully. And then Rāma"
4558,SECTION L.,"addressed (Gāruda), saying,—""By thy grace we have through means survived"
4559,SECTION L.,the mighty calamity that had sprung from Rāvana’s son; and we have also
4560,SECTION L.,"speedily been rendered strong. And my heart is delighted on having thee,"
4561,SECTION L.,"like unto my father, Daçaratha, or my grand sire, Aja. Who art thou,"
4562,SECTION L.,"furnished with beauty, and bearing wreaths and unguents (on thy person);"
4563,SECTION L.,"clad in stainless attire; and adorned in noble ornaments?"" Unto him"
4564,SECTION L.,spake the exceedingly energetic son of Vinatā endowed with great
4565,SECTION L.,"strength,—the lord of birds, with a pleased heart, and his eyes wild"
4566,SECTION L.,"with glee,—""O Kākutstha, I am thy friend—thy life ranging"
4567,SECTION L.,externally—Garutman. I am come hither for aiding you. Neither the highly
4568,SECTION L.,"powerful Asuras, nor the exceedingly strong monkeys, nor the celestials"
4569,SECTION L.,"along with the Gandharbas, having him of an hundred sacrifices at their"
4570,SECTION L.,"head are,—capable of delivering (any one) from these dreadful arrowy"
4571,SECTION L.,"bonds, which had been forged by Indrajit of tortuous deeds by help of"
4572,SECTION L.,illusion. These serpents—offspring of Kadru—are sharp-fanged and
4573,SECTION L.,venomous; and had bound thee as arrows through the potency of illusion.
4574,SECTION L.,"O Rāma having truth for prowess, thou art fortunate,—along with that"
4575,SECTION L.,"destroyer of foe in fight, Lakshmana. Hearing this, I, summoning energy,"
4576,SECTION L.,"have come hither swiftly. And I, doing by thee as a friend, have from"
4577,SECTION L.,affection at once set you free from these dreadful arrowy bonds. But
4578,SECTION L.,thou shouldst always be on thy guard. By nature the Rākshasas have
4579,SECTION L.,"cunning shifts in fight and thou, who art heroic and of a pure spirit,"
4580,SECTION L.,canst but rely on thy simplicity alone for strength. Therefore thou must
4581,SECTION L.,not trust the Rākshasas in the field of battle. By this one instance
4582,SECTION L.,"(thou must know; that Rākshasas are ever deceitful in fight"". Having"
4583,SECTION L.,"said this, the wondrous mighty Suparna, embracing Rāma) tenderly"
4584,SECTION L.,"(again), said,—""My friend Rāghava, O thou who even cherishest affection"
4585,SECTION L.,"for thy foes, permit me thou. I shall go at pleasure. And, O Rāghava,"
4586,SECTION L.,"entertain no curiosity as to our friendship.¹⁵⁹ When, O hero, thou shalt"
4587,SECTION L.,"have achieved success in battle, thou shalt know all about this"
4588,SECTION L.,"friendship of ours. And with the surges of thy shafts, making Lankā"
4589,SECTION L.,"contain only children and aged, and slaying thy foe, Rāvana, thou shalt"
4590,SECTION L.,"recover Sitā"". Having spoken thus, Suparna, endowed with fleet vigor,"
4591,SECTION L.,"having rendered Rāma hale in the midst of the monkeys,—having gone round"
4592,SECTION L.,"them and embraced them also,—that one possessed of prowess,—set out,"
4593,SECTION L.,"covering up the sky, like unto the wind. And seeing Raghu’s sons"
4594,SECTION L.,"rendered hale, the monkey-leaders set up leonine roars, and began to"
4595,SECTION L.,flourish their tails. And then beat the kettle-drums and the drums
4596,SECTION L.,struck up. And conchs were cheerfully blown; and shouts were sent. And
4597,SECTION L.,"others struck at their arms with their hands. And the monkeys,"
4598,SECTION L.,"accustomed to battle with trees, uprooting them, stood by hundreds and"
4599,SECTION L.,thousands. And emitting tremendous roars and thereby frightening the
4600,SECTION L.,"night-rangers, the monkeys, eager for encounter, approached the gate of"
4601,SECTION L.,"Lankā. And that mighty and dreadful din raised by the monkeys, resembled"

4620,SECTION LI.,noise—that prodigious uproar—Rāvana said in the midst of his
4621,SECTION LI.,"counsellors,—""From mighty roars that are heard of in innumerous"
4622,SECTION LI.,"delighted monkeys,—resembling the roar of clouds,—it is evident, beyond"
4623,SECTION LI.,"a doubt, that there is great rejoicing there. And the salt Ocean is"

4625,SECTION LI.,been fast bound with sharp shafts; and here this uproar is exciting my
4626,SECTION LI.,"alarm"". Having spoken thus unto his ministers, the lord of the Rākshasas"
4627,SECTION LI.,"addressed the Nairitas present there, saying,—""Do you speedily acquaint"
4628,SECTION LI.,yourselves with the cause of rejoicing that hath arisen of these monkeys
4629,SECTION LI.,"on this mournful occasion"". Thus accosted, they hurriedly mounting up on"
4630,SECTION LI.,"the wall, surveyed the forces maintained by the high-souled Sugriva as"
4631,SECTION LI.,well as those exalted ones—Raghu’s sons— emancipated from their terrific
4632,SECTION LI.,"arrowy fetters and arisen (now)"". Thereat, with their hearts wrought up,"
4633,SECTION LI.,"grim-visaged Rākshasas descending from the wall, appeared before the"
4634,SECTION LI.,"Rākshasa-lord with pale faces. And then with woe-begone faces, those"
4635,SECTION LI.,"Rākshasas, skilled in speech, faithfully informed Rāvana in full of that"
4636,SECTION LI.,"unfortunate circumstance. ""Those brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—who had in"
4637,SECTION LI.,"battle been bound up in arrowy fetters by Indrajit,—and whose arms lay"
4638,SECTION LI.,"moveless,—having been emancipated from the arrowy bonds, are seen in the"
4639,SECTION LI.,field of battle; and those ones like unto the foremost of elephants in
4640,SECTION LI.,"strength, seem like elephants that have snapped their fetters"". Hearing"
4641,SECTION LI.,"those words of theirs, the exeedingly powerful lord of the Rākshasas was"
4642,SECTION LI.,"wrought up with anxiety and anger, and his countenance lost its"
4643,SECTION LI.,"complexion. ""Indrajit, having routed them in conflict, had bound them by"
4644,SECTION LI.,"means of irrisistible and terrible arrows, resembling venomous serpents,"
4645,SECTION LI.,"and like unto the Sun himself,—which had been conferred on (Indrajit) as"
4646,SECTION LI.,"boons. But if my enemy, having actually been bound by the weapons, can"

4648,SECTION LI.,"And those shafts resembling Fire in fierceness, which had in battle"
4649,SECTION LI.,"deprived my foes of their lives,—have forsooth been rendered fruitless""."
4650,SECTION LI.,"Having said this in high rage, Rāvana, sighing like a serpent, addressed"
4651,SECTION LI.,"a Rākshasa, named Dhumrāksha, seated in the midst of the Rākshasas,—""O"
4652,SECTION LI.,"thou of dreadful prowess, surrounded by a mighty force, do thou march"

4654,SECTION LI.,"accosted by the intelligent lord of the Rākshasas, Dhumrāksha, turning"
4655,SECTION LI.,"about, issued out of the abode of the king. And speedily sallying forth"
4656,SECTION LI.,"from the gate of (Rāvana’s) residence, he said unto the general of the"
4657,SECTION LI.,"forces,—""Do thou speedily move off thy forces. Why should a warrior"
4658,SECTION LI.,"linger?"" Hearing Dhumrāksha’s words, the general of the forces,"
4659,SECTION LI.,"following them, at the command of Rāvana forthwith made the army ready."
4660,SECTION LI.,"And those powerful and dreadful night-rangers, bursting with high"

4663,SECTION LI.,"darts and clubs, and equipped with maces and bearded darts and rods and"
4664,SECTION LI.,iron bludgeons and _parighas_ and _bhindipālas_ and lances and nooses

4701,SECTION LII.,And the Rākshasas began to scatter the dreadful monkeys on all sides;

4705,SECTION LII.,"with dreadful clubs and bearded darts, daggers and maces and terrible"
4706,SECTION LII.,"and curious bludgeons and grasped javelins,—the exceedingly powerful"
4707,SECTION LII.,"(monkeys), their anger aroused, began with alacrity to perform deeds of"

4714,SECTION LII.,some among the Rākshasas feeding on gore—on being agitated by the
4715,SECTION LII.,"monkeys burning for victory,—began to vomit blood. And some were severed"
4716,SECTION LII.,"along their flanks; and, some, slain with trees, were heaped up; and"

4721,SECTION LII.,"measuring mountains, and mountain-tops, and steeds crushed, and the"

4723,SECTION LII.,"again, the vehement monkeys endowed with terrific prowess, with their"
4724,SECTION LII.,finger-nails tore up the Rākshasas by the mouths. And with woe-begone
4725,SECTION LII.,"faces, and with hair dishevelled, (the Rākshasas), stupified with the"
4726,SECTION LII.,"smell of blood, saught the earth. And other Rākshasas endowed with"
4727,SECTION LII.,"dreadful vigor, waxing wondrous wroth, dealt the monkeys slaps with"

4733,SECTION LII.,"And some of the monkeys, sore assailed with _prāças_, began to bleed;"
4734,SECTION LII.,"and some, wounded with maces, dropped down to the ground. And some were"

4736,SECTION LII.,"some, on being assailed with bearded darts, became insensible and lost"

4738,SECTION LII.,"drenched in blood. And some, fleeing away from the field, were"
4739,SECTION LII.,"slaughtered by the infuriated Rākshasas. And some, having their breasts"
4740,SECTION LII.,"pierced, lay on their sides. And some were riven with tridents; and the"
4741,SECTION LII.,entrails of some had come out. And that mighty and dreadful encounter of
4742,SECTION LII.,"the Rākshasas and the monkeys, was waged with countless weapons and"
4743,SECTION LII.,rocks and trees. And that battle became a musical entertainment¹⁶¹
4744,SECTION LII.,"mellifluous with bow-string for _Vinā_,¹⁶² having the neighing of"
4745,SECTION LII.,"chargers for its measure, and with the cries of _Maindas_¹⁶³ for its"
4746,SECTION LII.,"strains. Then in the field, Dhumrāksha bow in hand, laughing, pursued"
4747,SECTION LII.,the monkeys in all directions with showers of shafts. And seeing the
4748,SECTION LII.,"forces hard beset by Dhumrāksha and distressed thereat, the Wind-god’s"
4749,SECTION LII.,"offspring, waxing enraged, seizing a huge crag, approached (the"
4750,SECTION LII.,"Rākshasa). And with his eyes doubly reddened in wrath, that one, like"
4751,SECTION LII.,"unto his sire himself in prowess, brought down the crag upon"
4752,SECTION LII.,"Dhumrāksha’s car. And seeing the crag, (Dhumrāksha) upraising his mace"
4753,SECTION LII.,"hurriedly, leapt down in vehemence, and stood on the ground. And having"
4754,SECTION LII.,"shattered his car, that crag fell down to the earth. And thereat letting"
4755,SECTION LII.,"go the car furnished with wheels, _Kuvaras_ and a face, as well as a"
4756,SECTION LII.,"banner; in which Dhumrāksha had left his bow,—Hanumān—son unto the"
4757,SECTION LII.,"Wind-god—laid about him right lustily for destroying the Rākshasas, with"
4758,SECTION LII.,trees having branches long and short. And thereat some Rākshasas with
4759,SECTION LII.,"their heads shattered, lay drenched in blood; and others, struck with"
4760,SECTION LII.,"trees, dropped down to the earth. And then Hanumān—son unto the"
4761,SECTION LII.,"Wind-god—charged in full career against the Rākshasa army; and, taking a"
4762,SECTION LII.,"mountain-peak, he rushed against Dhumrāksha. And as Hanumān was"
4763,SECTION LII.,"descending, the powerful Dhumrāksha, upraising a mace, and giving out a"
4764,SECTION LII.,"shout, made towards him speedily. And then Dhumrāksha enraged, brought"
4765,SECTION LII.,"down that mace studded with innumerable pricks, on the head of Hanumān"
4766,SECTION LII.,fired with wrath. And thus assailed with the mace of fearful
4767,SECTION LII.,"impetuosity! the monkey endowed with the strength of the wind, without"
4768,SECTION LII.,"at all heeding that blow, let fall a mountain-top right against"
4769,SECTION LII.,"Dhumrāksha’s head. And on being assailed with the mountain-peak,"
4770,SECTION LII.,"Dhumrāksha, having his entire body mangled, suddenly fell to the earth,"
4771,SECTION LII.,"like unto a toppling hill. And seeing Dhumrāksha slain, those"
4772,SECTION LII.,"night-rangers that survived the carnage, in extreme agitation began to"
4773,SECTION LII.,"pour into Lankā, attacked by the monkeys. And that high-souled offspring"
4774,SECTION LII.,"of the Wind-god, having slain his foes, and come under the influence of"
4775,SECTION LII.,"fatigue incident to his slaughtering his enemies,—having caused rivers"
4776,SECTION LII.,"of gore to flow (in the field),—experienced the excess of joy on being"

4895,SECTION LIV.,"monkeys (in the field). And the exceedingly powerful Vajradanshtra,"

4898,SECTION LIV.,"rushed towards Angada, like vultures resorting to the Creator. And"
4899,SECTION LIV.,"finding the monkey-ranks disordered, Vāli’s son in a rage cast his eyes"

4907,SECTION LIV.,"career, the Rākshasa without betraying any agitation, severed it in"
4908,SECTION LIV.,"pieces; and the tree, thus assailed, fell to the earth. And seeing that"
4909,SECTION LIV.,"feat of Vajradanshtra, that foremost of monkeys, taking up a huge crag,"
4910,SECTION LIV.,hurled it (at his foe) and sent up shouts. And seeing this descend upon
4911,SECTION LIV.,"him, that powerful one, calmly leaping down from his vehicle, stood on"

4913,SECTION LIV.,"in the field, dashed to pieces the car along with the wheels and the"
4914,SECTION LIV.,"_Kuvara_ as well as the horses. And then the monkey, taking up another"
4915,SECTION LIV.,"prodigious peak crowned with trees, let it alight on Vajradanshtra’s"
4916,SECTION LIV.,"head. Thereat vomitting blood, Vajradanshtra, deprived of his senses,"

4983,SECTION LV.,"fair day, it looked foul with the wind breathing roughly. And fierce and"
4984,SECTION LV.,frightful beasts and birds began to emit cries. And that lion-shouldered
4985,SECTION LV.,"one like a tiger in prowess, without heeding these ominous occurences,"
4986,SECTION LV.,marched forth into the field. And as that Rākshasa was setting out along
4987,SECTION LV.,"with the Rākshasas, he set up mighty roars as if agitating the deep. And"
4988,SECTION LV.,the mighty army of monkeys was seized with trepidation at that sound.
4989,SECTION LV.,And then there took place a mighty encounter of the Rākshasas and the
4990,SECTION LV.,monkeys equipped staying in fight with trees and rocks; who had given up
4991,SECTION LV.,all concern for their selves in behalf of Rāma and Rāvana. And each side
4992,SECTION LV.,"desirous of slaying the other, the monkeys and the Rākshasas were"
4993,SECTION LV.,exceedingly strong and heroic and like unto mountains. And each party
4994,SECTION LV.,"storming at the other, in that conflict were heard loud cries emitted by"
4995,SECTION LV.,those swift-speeding ones in anger. And fearful was the dust red-hued
4996,SECTION LV.,that was raised incessantly by the monkeys and the Rakshas; and it
4997,SECTION LV.,"enveloped the ten cardinal points. And in the field of battle, each"
4998,SECTION LV.,"enveloped with that dust raised, pale as silk, could not be discovered"
4999,SECTION LV.,"by the other. And in consequence of that dust arising, neither standard,"
5000,SECTION LV.,"nor ensign, nor shield, nor steed, nor weapon, nor car could be seen."
5001,SECTION LV.,And the fierce cries alone of those roaring and rushing were heard in
5002,SECTION LV.,that dreadful battle; but their forms were not visible to the sight. And
5003,SECTION LV.,"in that conflict in the dark then monkeys enraged slew monkeys, and"
5004,SECTION LV.,Rākshasas Rakshsasas. And monkeys and Rākshasas slaying
5005,SECTION LV.,"(indiscriminately) friends and foes, made the earth wet with blood, and"
5006,SECTION LV.,miry. And then with showers of blood the dust was layed; and the earth
5007,SECTION LV.,was covered with corpses. And Rākshasas and monkeys fast slew each other
5008,SECTION LV.,"vigorously with trees and darts, maces and _prācas_, rocks, bludgeons"
5009,SECTION LV.,"and _tomaras_, and by means of their arms resembling bludgeons, coped"
5010,SECTION LV.,with their adversaries appearing like hills. And in the encounter
5011,SECTION LV.,"monkeys slew Rākshasas of dreadful deeds. And in their turn Rākshasas,"
5012,SECTION LV.,"wrought up with passion, bearing in their hands _prāças_ and _tomaras_"
5013,SECTION LV.,destroyed monkeys wielding dire arms. And that leader of the
5014,SECTION LV.,"force—Akampana—growing wroth, inspired with cheerfulness all the"
5015,SECTION LV.,Rākshasas endowed with dreadful vigor. And the monkeys forcibly
5016,SECTION LV.,"snatching away the weapons (of the Rākshasas), began to rive the"
5017,SECTION LV.,Rākshasas with mighty trees and giant crags. In the meanwhile those
5018,SECTION LV.,"heroes among the monkeys—Kumuda, Nila and the exceedingly exasperated"
5019,SECTION LV.,"Mainda, summoned the utmost impetuosity they were masters of. And those"
5020,SECTION LV.,foremost of monkeys and redoubtable able warriors without much ado began
5021,SECTION LV.,"to spread quite a carnage in the van of the Rākshasa army, and by means"
5022,SECTION LV.,of various arms terribly beat the Rākshasas.

5038,SECTION LVI.,"Akampana waxed furious with wrath. And transported with passion, he,"
5039,SECTION LVI.,"twanging his mighty bow, seeing that feat of his foe, addressed his"
5040,SECTION LVI.,"charioteer saying,—""O charioteer, swiftly conduct thou the car to that"
5041,SECTION LVI.,same place. These powerful ones are slaying innumerable Rākshasas in
5042,SECTION LVI.,"fight. And all those vigorous monkeys of dreadful deeds stay before me,"
5043,SECTION LVI.,"armed with trees and rocks. Those, pluming themselves overmuch on their"
5044,SECTION LVI.,"martial worth, I intended to slay in battle. And all this Rākshasa force"
5045,SECTION LVI.,"appeared to be harassed by these"". Then on a car drawn by moving steeds,"
5046,SECTION LVI.,Akampana from a distance attacked the monkeys with showers of arrows.
5047,SECTION LVI.,And thereat the monkeys could not so much as maintain their ground in
5048,SECTION LVI.,"the field,—and how could they fight? And broken by the arrows of"
5049,SECTION LVI.,"Akampana, they began to fly. And the exceedingly strong Hanumān, seeing"
5050,SECTION LVI.,his kindred come under the masterdom of Death and follow the course
5051,SECTION LVI.,"pursued by the shafts of Akampana, advanced (to the conflict). And"
5052,SECTION LVI.,"seeing that mighty monkey, all those heroic prime monkeys together"
5053,SECTION LVI.,"surrounded (Hanumān) in the field. And those best of monkeys, seeing"
5054,SECTION LVI.,"Hanumān stay, grew strong by relying on that strong one. And even as the"
5055,SECTION LVI.,"great Indra showereth down rain, Akampana showered shafts on Hanumān"
5056,SECTION LVI.,resembling a mountain-summit in grandeur. And without casting a thought
5057,SECTION LVI.,"on the showers of arrows poured on his person, that monkey gifted with"
5058,SECTION LVI.,"exceeding strength, set his heart on compassing the death of Akampana."
5059,SECTION LVI.,"And laughing, that exceedingly energetic offspring of the Wind-god"
5060,SECTION LVI.,"rushed after that Raksha, as if making the Earth herself tremble. And"
5061,SECTION LVI.,"the form of that one roaring and flaming up in energy, was irresistible,"
5062,SECTION LVI.,like unto the appearance of a flaming fire. And thinking that he was
5063,SECTION LVI.,"unfurnished with any arms, that foremost of monkeys, waxing wroth,"
5064,SECTION LVI.,"vehemently rooted up a hill. And taking that huge hill, the Wind-god’s"
5065,SECTION LVI.,"son endowed with prowess, sending up a tremendous roar, began to whirl"
5066,SECTION LVI.,it with a single arm. And as of yore Purandara had in encounter pursued
5067,SECTION LVI.,"Namuchi with the thunder-bolt, (Hanumān) pursued that best of"
5068,SECTION LVI.,"Rākshasas—Akampana. And Akampana, seeing that uplifted crag, from a"
5069,SECTION LVI.,distance cut it off with mighty crescent-shaped shafts. And finding that
5070,SECTION LVI.,mountain-top severed by the shafts of the Raksha and scattered in
5071,SECTION LVI.,"pieces, Hanumān was seized with a mighty wrath. And that monkey, wrought"
5072,SECTION LVI.,"up with rage and pride, grasping an Açwakarna elevated like unto a hill,"
5073,SECTION LVI.,"at once uprooted it. And taking that broad-shouldered Açwakarna, that"
5074,SECTION LVI.,"one furnished with high splendour, with great glee whirled it above the"
5075,SECTION LVI.,"ground. And thereat rushing amain vehemently, (Akampana) speedily broke"
5076,SECTION LVI.,"the trees.¹⁷³ And (seeing this), Hanumān, transported with passion,"
5077,SECTION LVI.,"rived the earth with his kicks. And Hanumān slaughtered elephants, and"
5078,SECTION LVI.,"the riders thereof, and cars with their riders, and dreadful Rākshasas,"
5079,SECTION LVI.,and footmen. And seeing the enraged Hanumān resembling the Finisher
5080,SECTION LVI.,"armed with trees and destructive, the Rākshasas began to fly fast. And"
5081,SECTION LVI.,"seeing that one enraged, terrific unto the Rākshasas, the heroic"
5082,SECTION LVI.,Akampana was agitated greatly and sent up shouts. And Akampana pierced
5083,SECTION LVI.,"Hanumān endowed with exceeding prowess with four and ten shafts,"
5084,SECTION LVI.,sharpened and capable of cleaving the bodies of people. And thus covered
5085,SECTION LVI.,"with iron arrows and whetted darts, that hero—Hanumān—looked like a hill"
5086,SECTION LVI.,covered with trees. And that huge-bodied one endowed with wondrous
5087,SECTION LVI.,"prowess and great strength, appeared like a flowering Açoka or a fire"
5088,SECTION LVI.,"without smoke. And then uprooting another tree, (Hanumān) summoning up"
5089,SECTION LVI.,"his best impetuosity, swiftly hit Akampana—foremost of Rākshasas—on the"
5090,SECTION LVI.,head. And slain with that tree by that high-souled monkey-chief wrought
5091,SECTION LVI.,"up with passion, that Rākshasa fell down and died.¹⁷⁴ And seeing that"
5092,SECTION LVI.,"foremost of Rākshasas—Akampana—slain (and lying) on the ground,—the"
5093,SECTION LVI.,"Rākshasas were extremely aggrieved, and (appeared) like trees in an"
5094,SECTION LVI.,"earthquake. And those Rākshasas defeated, leaving their arms behind,"
5095,SECTION LVI.,"made for Lankā in fear, pursued by the monkeys. And with their hair"
5096,SECTION LVI.,"flowing loosely, (the Rākshasas), afflicted with affright, and"
5097,SECTION LVI.,"despirited and beaten, fled fast, with the water of fatigue running down"
5098,SECTION LVI.,"their persons. And crushing down each other, they entered the city in a"
5099,SECTION LVI.,"panic, momentarily casting their looks behind them. When the Rākshasas"
5100,SECTION LVI.,"had entered Lankā, the exceedingly mighty monkeys, assembled together,"
5101,SECTION LVI.,"paid homage unto Hanumān. And Hanumān, gifted with strength, honored the"
5102,SECTION LVI.,seniors each as he deserved in consideration of his lineage. And the
5103,SECTION LVI.,"monkeys eager for victory shouted with might and main, and began to drag"
5104,SECTION LVI.,the Rākshasas with the view of taking their lives. And that mighty
5105,SECTION LVI.,monkey—son unto the Wind god—having destroyed the Rākshasas and arrived
5106,SECTION LVI.,"(in the midst of the host), attained heroic glory,—even as did Vishnu,"
5107,SECTION LVI.,having slain that destroyer of enemies—the mighty and dreadful Asura
5108,SECTION LVI.,"possessed of exceeding strength,—stationed in the van of the forces. And"
5109,SECTION LVI.,"then the deities and Rāma himself and the highly powerful Lakshmana, and"
5110,SECTION LVI.,"also the monkeys headed by Sugriva, and Bibhishana endowed with great"
5111,SECTION LVI.,"strength, honored that monkey."

5127,SECTION LVII.,forenoon he went round the city of Lankā for inspecting the barracks.
5128,SECTION LVII.,"And the king surveyed the city guarded by the Rākshasas, covered with"
5129,SECTION LVII.,"innumerable barracks, and crowned with ensigns and standards. And seeing"
5130,SECTION LVII.,"the city beseiged, Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—seasonably spoke words"
5131,SECTION LVII.,"of welfare unto Prahasta skilled in fight,—""Save battle, deliverance"
5132,SECTION LVII.,find I none for the city suddenly beleaguered and put to straits. And
5133,SECTION LVII.,this strain must be borne by these versed in warfare—me or Kumbhakarna
5134,SECTION LVII.,or thee—my general—or Indrajit or Nikumbha.¹⁷⁵ And therefore do thou
5135,SECTION LVII.,"from this place, speedily taking this force, march to where the monkeys"
5136,SECTION LVII.,"are, for securing victory (in the encounter). And as soon as thou"
5137,SECTION LVII.,"settest out, the monkey-forces, hearing the roars of the foremost"
5138,SECTION LVII.,"Rākshasas—speedily setting themselves in motion,—shall flee away. And"
5139,SECTION LVII.,"volatile and haughty and of fickle minds, the monkeys will not be able"
5140,SECTION LVII.,to bear thy shouts; even as elephants are incapable of bearing the
5141,SECTION LVII.,"roaring of a lion. And on that monkey-army running away, Rāma in company"
5142,SECTION LVII.,"with Sumitrā’s son, deprived of his power and shorn of support, shall, O"
5143,SECTION LVII.,"Prahasta, come under thy subjection. In this matter, thy being slain is"
5144,SECTION LVII.,"uncertain, but victory is certain. Now do thou, as thou weighest our"
5145,SECTION LVII.,"welfare, declare thyself for or against this course"". Thus addressed by"
5146,SECTION LVII.,"Rāvana, Prahasta—general of the forces—said unto the Rākshasa-chief;"
5147,SECTION LVII.,"like _Uçanas_ addressing the lord of Asuras,—""O, king, before this we"
5148,SECTION LVII.,"had deliberated together with wise counsellors, and then we disputed"
5149,SECTION LVII.,with each other in our respective views. And I had declared myself for
5150,SECTION LVII.,giving up Sitā as fraught with our welfare; and we saw war involved in
5151,SECTION LVII.,witholding her. I have ever been honored by thee variously with gifts
5152,SECTION LVII.,and regard and soft speech. And what is thy good for which I shall not
5153,SECTION LVII.,"be at the pains? My life I do not care to keep,—nor yet my sons or my"
5154,SECTION LVII.,wife. Behold! for thee will I offer up my life into the sacrificial fire
5155,SECTION LVII.,"of conflict"". Having said this unto his master—Rāvana—the general,"
5156,SECTION LVII.,"Prahasta, addressed his generals staying before him, saying,—""At once"
5157,SECTION LVII.,bring up the mighty host of Rākshasas. To-day in the field of fight will
5158,SECTION LVII.,I entertain the flesh-feeding fowls of the forest with the bodies of the
5159,SECTION LVII.,"foes slain with my resistless shafts"". Hearing his speech, the highly"
5160,SECTION LVII.,powerful leaders arrayed the army in that abode of the Rākshasa. And in
5161,SECTION LVII.,a moment Lankā swarmed with heroic and terrific Rākshasas equipped with
5162,SECTION LVII.,"various arms,—as if with elephants,—as well as with people worshipping"
5163,SECTION LVII.,"Fire and bowing down unto Brahmanas. And the perfumed breeze blew, laden"
5164,SECTION LVII.,"with the incense of sacrificial offerings. And the Rākshasas, inspired"
5165,SECTION LVII.,"with martial ardour, put on diverse garlands, consecrated with"
5166,SECTION LVII.,scriptural formulae; and donned on their armour. And furnished with
5167,SECTION LVII.,"their bows and wearing their armour, the Rākshasas, on seeing king"
5168,SECTION LVII.,"Rāvana, leaving (their vehicles), stood, surrounding Prahasta. Then"
5169,SECTION LVII.,"greeting the monarch, Prahasta, furnished (with all appliances of"
5170,SECTION LVII.,"battle),—winding his dreadful trumpet, ascended his car; having all"
5171,SECTION LVII.,sorts of weapons; yoked with wondrous fleet steeds; driven by a
5172,SECTION LVII.,"competent charioteer,—excellently furnished; sending up sounds"
5173,SECTION LVII.,"resembling the rumbling of mighty masses of cloud,—appearing like the"
5174,SECTION LVII.,very Sun or Moon; invincible with a serpent-standard; having a defence
5175,SECTION LVII.,as well as a portion exceedingly handsome; netted with gold all round;
5176,SECTION LVII.,"and seeming to be laughing in grace. And then, ascending this car,"
5177,SECTION LVII.,"Prahasta, whom Rāvana had entrusted with authority, surrounded by a vast"
5178,SECTION LVII.,"host, swiftly went out of Lankā. And then there were heard the sounds of"
5179,SECTION LVII.,"kettle-drums, resembling the roars of Parjanya,—and the sounds of"
5180,SECTION LVII.,"musical instruments, as if filling the Earth. And on that general of the"
5181,SECTION LVII.,"forces marching, sounds of conchs were heard (all around); and the"
5182,SECTION LVII.,"Rākshasas of dreadful forms and huge bodies, going before Prahasta,"
5183,SECTION LVII.,"advanced, emitting tremendous roars. And Narāntaka,¹⁷⁶ Kambhahanu,"
5184,SECTION LVII.,"Mahānāda,¹⁷⁷ and Samunnata,¹⁷⁸—Prahasta’s counsellors all of them—went"
5185,SECTION LVII.,"on, surrounding him. And he went out by the Eastern entrance, environed"
5186,SECTION LVII.,"by this exceedingly dreadful array, resembling troops of elephants. And"
5187,SECTION LVII.,resembling the Destroyer—Yama himself—Prahasta in rage went out
5188,SECTION LVII.,surrounded by that mighty host resembling the sea. And at the tumult
5189,SECTION LVII.,"raised by their exodus, as well as the roars of the Rākshasas, all"
5190,SECTION LVII.,creatures in Lankā began to cry in preternatural tones. And swarming
5191,SECTION LVII.,"under the cloudless welkin, birds feasting on flesh and gore began to"
5192,SECTION LVII.,"gyrate at the right hand of the car. And dreadful jackals, emitting live"
5193,SECTION LVII.,"flames from their mouths, set up cries. And stars began to shoot from"
5194,SECTION LVII.,"the firmament; and the winds to ruffle. And enraged at each other, the"
5195,SECTION LVII.,planetary bodies were shorn of their brightness. And clouds emitting
5196,SECTION LVII.,"sharp sounds showered down blood upon the car, and those marching in"
5197,SECTION LVII.,"front were washed therewith. And alighting at the top of the standard, a"
5198,SECTION LVII.,"vulture set up cries, facing the south, and began to prick both its"
5199,SECTION LVII.,"sides,—thereby depriving (Prahasta) of his grace. And from the hands of"
5200,SECTION LVII.,"his charioteer and his driver conducting the steeds, never given to"
5201,SECTION LVII.,"turning away from the field, the goad began to drop again and again. And"
5202,SECTION LVII.,"the auspiciousness that was bright and rare when the army set out, was"
5203,SECTION LVII.,"clean gone in a moment,—and the steeds began to stumble on even ground."
5204,SECTION LVII.,"And as Prahasta of renowned worth and valor marched, the monkey-army"
5205,SECTION LVII.,"equipped with various arms, presented themselves before him. And loud"
5206,SECTION LVII.,was the tumult that was raised by the monkeys. And mighty was the din
5207,SECTION LVII.,"that was heard of those, uprooting trees and taking up ponderous crags"
5208,SECTION LVII.,of the Rākshasas roaring and the monkeys storming in both the
5209,SECTION LVII.,"exhilarated armies of Rakshas and wood-rangers,—of vehement and able"
5210,SECTION LVII.,"(warriors) eager for slaying each other, and challenging each other to"
5211,SECTION LVII.,"fight. And like an insect falling into a flame, the wicked-minded"

5237,SECTION LVIII.,"Rākshasa named Prahasta, surrounded by a third of the forces. He is"
5238,SECTION LVIII.,possessed of prowess and is of distinguished gallantry. And that mighty

5240,SECTION LVIII.,"saw him dreadful and of terrific prowess and huge-bodied,—surrounded on"
5241,SECTION LVIII.,"all sides by the Rākshasas,—and setting up roars, marching. And the"

5245,SECTION LVIII.,"the monkeys on their part, eager for encounter, took up flowering trees"
5246,SECTION LVIII.,and hills and huge and broad crags. And each party approaching the
5247,SECTION LVIII.,"other, great was the encounter that took place. And innumerable (monkeys"
5248,SECTION LVIII.,and Rākshasas) kept showering rocks and arrows. And many Rākshasas in
5249,SECTION LVIII.,"conflict slew many a powerful monkey, and the monkeys on their part"
5250,SECTION LVIII.,slaughtered many a Rākshasa. And some were pierced with darts and with
5251,SECTION LVIII.,(other) powerful weapons; and some were wounded with bludgeons; and some
5252,SECTION LVIII.,"were hewn with axes. And some rendered senseless, dropped down to the"
5253,SECTION LVIII.,"earth; and some hit with weapons, had their breasts riven. And some,"
5254,SECTION LVIII.,"severed in twain with swords, dropped to the earth lifeless. And monkeys"
5255,SECTION LVIII.,were hewn in their sides by heroic Rākshasas. And numbers of Rākshasas
5256,SECTION LVIII.,all around were beaten to the ground by infuriated monkeys with trees
5257,SECTION LVIII.,and mountain-peaks. And some smitten sore with slaps having the touch of
5258,SECTION LVIII.,"the thunder-bolt, began to vomit blood from their mouths, with faces and"
5259,SECTION LVIII.,eyes turned pale. And great was the uproar that arose in consequence of
5260,SECTION LVIII.,Rākshasas and monkeys emitting distressful cries and sending forth
5261,SECTION LVIII.,"leonine roars. And monkeys and Rākshasas wrought up with wrath, engaged"
5262,SECTION LVIII.,"in treading the path of heroes,—looking terrific with their faces moving"
5263,SECTION LVIII.,"about,—performed deeds of intrepid courage. And Narāntaka and Kambhahanu"
5264,SECTION LVIII.,and Mahānāda and Samunnata—all counsellors of Prahasta—set about
5265,SECTION LVIII.,slaughtering the rangers of the woods. Of these doing swift execution
5266,SECTION LVIII.,"among the monkeys, Dwivida, taking up a mountain-peak, slew one—namely"
5267,SECTION LVIII.,"Narāntaka. And then the monkey, Durmukha, rising up afresh, armed with a"
5268,SECTION LVIII.,"mighty tree, killed the light-handed Rākshasa—Samunnata. And Jāmbavān"
5269,SECTION LVIII.,"endowed with energy, waxing enraged, uplifting a giant crag brought the"
5270,SECTION LVIII.,"same down on Mahānāda’s breast. And there speedily assailed by Tāra,"
5271,SECTION LVIII.,"with a mighty tree, the powerful Kumbhahanu gave up the ghost in the"
5272,SECTION LVIII.,"conflict. And not brooking that feat, Prahasta, mounted on a car, taking"
5273,SECTION LVIII.,"a bow in his hand, fell to spreading a dreadful havoc among the rangers"
5274,SECTION LVIII.,of the woods. And then there the two hosts mingled into almost a vortex;
5275,SECTION LVIII.,and the sounds that arose from those infuriated ones of immeasurable
5276,SECTION LVIII.,"might, resembled the roar of the ocean. And in terrific encounter the"
5277,SECTION LVIII.,enraged Rākshasa irresistible in battle drove the monkeys to sore
5278,SECTION LVIII.,straits with showers of arrows. And the earth was covered quite with the
5279,SECTION LVIII.,terrible bodies of monkeys and Rākshasas; and it looked as if covered
5280,SECTION LVIII.,with mountains. And the earth drenched with streams of gore looked as if

5282,SECTION LVIII.,"leaders of elephant-herds cross a lotus-tank covered with lotus-dust,"
5283,SECTION LVIII.,those Rākshasas and choice monkeys crossed that river flowing in the
5284,SECTION LVIII.,field of conflict incapable of being crossed; having for her banks hosts
5285,SECTION LVIII.,of heroic warriors slain; for her mighty trees broken arms; for her
5286,SECTION LVIII.,volume of waters showers of blood; coursing to Yama resembling the
5287,SECTION LVIII.,Ocean; with livers and spleens for her vast slime; with scattered
5288,SECTION LVIII.,entrails for her moss; with riven bodies and heads for her fish; limbs
5289,SECTION LVIII.,for her lawns; swarming with vultures for her swans; with Kankas for her
5290,SECTION LVIII.,cranes; filled with fat representing her foam; with the roars (of
5291,SECTION LVIII.,"warriors) for her sounds,—incapable of being crossed by cravens,—and"
5292,SECTION LVIII.,resembling a real river swarming at the end of the rains with cranes and
5293,SECTION LVIII.,"swans. Then all of a sudden Nila saw Prahasta stationed on his car,"
5294,SECTION LVIII.,discharging vollies of shafts and harassing the monkeys therewith. And
5295,SECTION LVIII.,"mounted on a sun-bright vehicle, that leader of the army—Prahasta—seeing"
5296,SECTION LVIII.,"Nila advance towards him amain in the encounter, like the wind in the"
5297,SECTION LVIII.,"sky scattering a mighty mass of clouds,—rushed towards Nila. And that"
5298,SECTION LVIII.,"leader of forces—Prahasta—foremost of bowmen, stretching his bow, began"
5299,SECTION LVIII.,"to shower arrows on Nila. And having pierced Nila sore and wounded him,"
5300,SECTION LVIII.,those shafts sought the earth like enraged serpents. And that mighty
5301,SECTION LVIII.,"monkey—Nila—endowed with energy, struck with those sharpened shafts"
5302,SECTION LVIII.,"resembling flames,—uprooting a tree, assailed therewith the"
5303,SECTION LVIII.,"irrepressible Prahasta—who was rushing against him. And thereat, that"
5304,SECTION LVIII.,"foremost of Rākshasas, on being attacked, flaming up into fury and"
5305,SECTION LVIII.,"uttering roars,—poured showers of arrows on the monkey-leader. And not"
5306,SECTION LVIII.,"being able to resist the arrowy vollies of that wicked-minded Rākshasa,"
5307,SECTION LVIII.,"(Nila) bore them, even as a bull beareth with closed eyes a"
5308,SECTION LVIII.,fast-descending autumnal shower. And in the very same way did Nila with
5309,SECTION LVIII.,his eyes closed suddenly stand the mighty arrowy buffet of Prahasta
5310,SECTION LVIII.,"incapable of being withstood. And wrought up with rage, the exceedingly"
5311,SECTION LVIII.,strong and mighty Nila with a giant _Sāla_ slew the steeds of Prahasta.
5312,SECTION LVIII.,"And then his soul surcharged with wrath, Nila swiftly shattered the bow"
5313,SECTION LVIII.,"of that wicked-minded one, and then shouted again and again. On being"
5314,SECTION LVIII.,"bereft of his bow, Prahasta, general of forces, taking a terrible mace,"
5315,SECTION LVIII.,leapt down from his car. And the redoubtable leaders endowed with
5316,SECTION LVIII.,"activity, bearing hostility to each other, their persons bathed in"
5317,SECTION LVIII.,"blood, stood (on the ground) like two elephants (with their temples)"
5318,SECTION LVIII.,riven. And they kept tearing each other with their teeth like a lion and
5319,SECTION LVIII.,"a tiger, and also striving like a lion and a tiger. And endowed with"
5320,SECTION LVIII.,"victorious vigor, those heroes, never knowing to desist from fight, were"
5321,SECTION LVIII.,"eager for fame, even like Vritra and Vāsava (fighting). And then"
5322,SECTION LVIII.,"Prahasta putting forth his dearest effort, hit Nila on the temples with"
5323,SECTION LVIII.,"a mace; and the blood began to flow. And then the mighty monkey, with"
5324,SECTION LVIII.,"his person drenched in blood,—wrought up with passion, discharged a tall"
5325,SECTION LVIII.,"tree at Prahasta’s breast. And without caring for that hit, he, taking"
5326,SECTION LVIII.,"up a mighty mace, furiously rushed against the monkey—Nila. And"
5327,SECTION LVIII.,witnessing that enraged (hero) rushing against him with exceeding
5328,SECTION LVIII.,"impetuosity, that redoubted monkey endowed with vehemence, took up a"
5329,SECTION LVIII.,tremendous crag. And in the encounter Nila at once let that crag alight
5330,SECTION LVIII.,"right on the head of Prahasta, eager for encounter and fighting with the"
5331,SECTION LVIII.,"mace. And hurled by that foremost of monkeys, that huge and terrific"
5332,SECTION LVIII.,crag then shattered Prahasta’s head in pieces. And then bereft of life
5333,SECTION LVIII.,"and shorn of nerve and devoid of sense, he suddenly dropped down to the"
5334,SECTION LVIII.,earth like a tree whose roots have been severed. And even as fountains
5335,SECTION LVIII.,"flow from the sides of a hill, blood flowed profusely from the person of"
5336,SECTION LVIII.,"that one, whose head had been riven. On Prahasta being slain by Nila,"
5337,SECTION LVIII.,"that mighty army of Rākshasas, never trembling (from fear),—retreated"
5338,SECTION LVIII.,"towards Lankā. And like waters rushing (through a breach in) a dyke, the"
5339,SECTION LVIII.,"Rākshasas could not stand their ground, on their leader being slain. And"
5340,SECTION LVIII.,"on that head of the hosts being killed, the Rākshasas, growing"
5341,SECTION LVIII.,"dispirited, repairing to the residence of the lord of Rakshas, remained"
5342,SECTION LVIII.,"plunged in thought, without speaking anything. And plunged in that sea"
5343,SECTION LVIII.,"of sorrow, they seemed as if they had been bereft of their senses. And"
5344,SECTION LVIII.,"then the highly powerful and victorious Nila, leader of forces, on being"
5345,SECTION LVIII.,"extolled with gracious offices, and on being joined by Rāma and"
5346,SECTION LVIII.,"Lakshmana, looked exceedingly exhilarated."

5349,SECTION LVIII.,
5350,SECTION LIX.,SECTION LIX.
5351,SECTION LIX.,
5352,SECTION LIX.,
5353,SECTION LIX.,And on the leader of the Rākshasa host being slain in battle by the
5354,SECTION LIX.,"foremost of monkeys, that army of the Rākshasa monarch, resembling the"
5355,SECTION LIX.,"ocean in violence,—furnished with dreadful weapons, began to scamper"
5356,SECTION LIX.,"away. And going to the lord of the Rākshasas, they apprised him of the"
5357,SECTION LIX.,death of his general at the hands of the Fire-god’s offspring. And
5358,SECTION LIX.,"hearing those words of theirs, the Rākshasa lord was overcome with rage."
5359,SECTION LIX.,"And hearing that Prahasta had been killed in battle, (he), exercised"
5360,SECTION LIX.,"with passion, with his heart influenced with grief, addressed those"
5361,SECTION LIX.,"foremost of the Rākshasa hosts, even as Indra addresses the chiefs among"
5362,SECTION LIX.,"the celestials, saying,—""That foe should no longer be disregarded that"
5363,SECTION LIX.,hath slain along with his followers and elephants that leader of my
5364,SECTION LIX.,"hosts that had destroyed the forces of Indra himself. Therefore, without"
5365,SECTION LIX.,"taking thought, will I, for compassing the destruction of the foe,"
5366,SECTION LIX.,"myself march to that marvellous field of fight. And to-day, even as a"
5367,SECTION LIX.,"flaming fire burneth down a forest, will I with showers of shafts burn"
5368,SECTION LIX.,"up that monkey-army, and Rāma and Lakshmana"". Saying this, that enemy of"
5369,SECTION LIX.,the sovereign of the immortals ascended a flaming vehicle of dazzling
5370,SECTION LIX.,"sheen yoked to rows of excellent steeds,—displaying itself gloriously"
5371,SECTION LIX.,"and having a glowing body. And eulogized with sacred hymns, the"
5372,SECTION LIX.,sovereign of the Rākshasa rulers then set out to the sounds of conchs
5373,SECTION LIX.,and trumpets and _panavas_; and in the midst of those produced by
5374,SECTION LIX.,"persons striking at their arms, with their hands, and of the sounds"
5375,SECTION LIX.,"defiance, and leonine roars. And like that lord of the"
5376,SECTION LIX.,"immortals—Rudra—surrounded by ghosts, the foremost of the Rākshsa"
5377,SECTION LIX.,monarchs was surrounded by bands of flesh-feeding (Rakshas) resembling
5378,SECTION LIX.,"cliffs and clouds,—with eyes glowing like fire. And at once issuing from"
5379,SECTION LIX.,"the city, that one endowed with high energy saw that fierce array of"
5380,SECTION LIX.,"monkeys, extended as the ocean or a mighty mass of clouds,—with arms"
5381,SECTION LIX.,upraised with rocks and stones. And seeing that terrific host of
5382,SECTION LIX.,"Rākshasas, that eminently auspicious one, followed by the forces, having"
5383,SECTION LIX.,"arms resembling the lord of serpents—Rāma—spoke unto Bibhishana,"
5384,SECTION LIX.,"foremost of those bearing arms,—""Whose is this force furnished with"
5385,SECTION LIX.,various ensigns and standards—and equipped with _prācas_ and swords and
5386,SECTION LIX.,"darts and other arms,—consisting of intrepid (Rākshasas), and having"
5387,SECTION LIX.,"elephants resembling Mahendra¹⁷⁹ itself"". Then hearing Rāma’s speech,"
5388,SECTION LIX.,"Bibhishana, possessed of the prowess of Sakra himself, informed Rāma"
5389,SECTION LIX.,anent that foremost of hosts consisting of that flower of high-souled
5390,SECTION LIX.,"Rākshasas, saying,—""O king, him do thou know to be Akampana, who,"
5391,SECTION LIX.,"possessed of a high soul, is on the back of that elephant,—whose face"
5392,SECTION LIX.,"looks like the sun new risen, and who approacheth making the head of his"
5393,SECTION LIX.,elephant tremble (with the splendour of his person).¹⁸⁰ And that one is
5394,SECTION LIX.,"named Indrajit—foremost by virtue of the boon (that he hath obtained),"
5395,SECTION LIX.,"who ascending a car and having a lion for his ensign,—twangeth his bow"
5396,SECTION LIX.,"like the very bow of Sakra displayed,—and who with his terrific round"
5397,SECTION LIX.,teeth appeareth like an elephant. And that one of a gigantic person is
5398,SECTION LIX.,"named Atikaya, that, like unto the Setting-hill of Vindhya, furnished"
5399,SECTION LIX.,"with the bow and stationed on a car,—highly heroic, stretcheth his bow"
5400,SECTION LIX.,of unparalleled proportions. And that high-souled hero is named Mahodara
5401,SECTION LIX.,"that, furnished with right coppery eyes resembling the sun new risen,"
5402,SECTION LIX.,"and ascending a car resonant with the sound of bells, shouteth shrill."
5403,SECTION LIX.,"And that one having the vehemence of the thunder-bolt is Piçācha, that,"
5404,SECTION LIX.,"mounted on a steed in variegated golden trappings, and having the aspect"
5405,SECTION LIX.,"of a mass of evening clouds, or a mountain,—(appeareth) with a _prāça_"
5406,SECTION LIX.,"furnished with effulgence. And that one is the famed Triçiras,¹⁸¹ that,"
5407,SECTION LIX.,grasping a whetted dart endowed with the splendour of lightning and
5408,SECTION LIX.,"having the speed of the thunder for its minister, approacheth, riding a"
5409,SECTION LIX.,bull—the best of his species—and having the appearance of the Moon
5410,SECTION LIX.,"himself. And that one looking like a mass of clouds, that, having a"
5411,SECTION LIX.,broad and beautiful breast and a banner surmounted with the king of
5412,SECTION LIX.,"serpents, goeth in collected carriage, stretching his bow is Kumbha. And"
5413,SECTION LIX.,"that one is Nikumbha of wondrous valorous deeds (in battle) that,"
5414,SECTION LIX.,grasping a flaming and smoky¹⁸² bludgeon embellished with gold and
5415,SECTION LIX.,"diamonds, cometh—a very banner of the entire Raksha host. And that one"
5416,SECTION LIX.,"is Narāntaka, fighting with mountain-peaks,—that appeareth before us,"
5417,SECTION LIX.,"mounted on a car flaming like fire, furnished with pennons and equipped"
5418,SECTION LIX.,with bows and swords and shafts. And that crusher of the hauteur of even
5419,SECTION LIX.,"the celestials,—that surrounded by various spectres of dreadful forms"
5420,SECTION LIX.,"having faces of tigers, or camels, or powerful elephants, or deer, or"
5421,SECTION LIX.,"horses,—and with their eyes rolling,—where the white umbrella resembling"
5422,SECTION LIX.,"the Moon,—shineth, graced with slender ribs—the high-souled sovereign of"
5423,SECTION LIX.,"Rakshas appeareth like Rudra himself environed by spectres,—the"
5424,SECTION LIX.,"sovereign of the Rakshas decked with a diadem, with his countenance"
5425,SECTION LIX.,"graced with pendulous ear-rings,—with a person resembling that monarch"
5426,SECTION LIX.,"of mountains—even Vindhya himself,—that humbler of the pride of Indra"
5427,SECTION LIX.,"the Great and Yama,—shineth like the Sun"". Then Rāma—repressor of"
5428,SECTION LIX.,"foes—answered Bibhishana, saying,—""Alas! Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—is"
5429,SECTION LIX.,"of exceeding glowing splendour; and Rāvana shineth in glory, and is"
5430,SECTION LIX.,"incapable of being gazed at like the Sun himself. And his grace, being"
5431,SECTION LIX.,"enshrouded in his own splendour, I cannot view plainly. And the persons"
5432,SECTION LIX.,of celestials appear splendid as doth the person of the Rākshasa-chief.
5433,SECTION LIX.,And all the warriors of that high-souled one are like mountains and
5434,SECTION LIX.,fight with crags; and all are equipped with flaming weapons. And
5435,SECTION LIX.,environed by glowing ghosts of dreadful forms and fierce-looking and
5436,SECTION LIX.,"furnished with material tenements,¹⁸³—the king of Rākshasas appeareth"
5437,SECTION LIX.,imposing like the Destroyer himself. And by luck it is that to-day the
5438,SECTION LIX.,wicked-minded one hath come within the range of my vision; and to-day
5439,SECTION LIX.,"will I vent my wrath incident to the ravishment of Sitā"". Having said"
5440,SECTION LIX.,"this, Rāma endowed with prowess, ever followed by Lakshmana, stood,"
5441,SECTION LIX.,taking up his bow and pulling out a powerful shaft. And then that
5442,SECTION LIX.,"high-souled lord of Rākshasas addressed that mighty host, saying,—""Do ye"
5443,SECTION LIX.,"casting off fear stay at ease, at the gateways, high ways, and the"
5444,SECTION LIX.,"edifices (in Lankā). Taking note of this lapse,—_viz_., that ye have all"
5445,SECTION LIX.,"come hither with me, the wood-rangers in a body, subduing the empty city"
5446,SECTION LIX.,"incapable of being withstood,—shall suddenly put (all) to straits"". Then"
5447,SECTION LIX.,"leaving those counsellors, (Rāvana) on the Rakshas having departed"
5448,SECTION LIX.,"agreeably to his injunction, dived into that ocean of monkeys, like a"
5449,SECTION LIX.,mighty fish diving into the waves of over brimming deep. And seeing the
5450,SECTION LIX.,"lord of Rākshasas, furnished with flaming a bow and arrows,—suddenly"
5451,SECTION LIX.,"rushing,—the king of monkeys, uprooting a mighty mountain-top, darted"
5452,SECTION LIX.,against the sovereign of the Rakshas. And taking up that mountain-peak
5453,SECTION LIX.,"having its sides covered with innumerable trees, he hurled it at the"
5454,SECTION LIX.,"night ranger. And seeing it descend swiftly, (Rāvana) in battle severed"
5455,SECTION LIX.,the same by means of gold-knobbed shafts. And on that gigantic peak
5456,SECTION LIX.,"furnished with fair sides filled with trees, falling to the earth,"
5457,SECTION LIX.,"severed in pieces,—the lord of Rākshasas took up an arrow, resembling a"
5458,SECTION LIX.,mighty serpent and having the splendour of the Destroyer himself. And
5459,SECTION LIX.,"taking that shaft endowed with the vehemence of the wind, flaming like a"
5460,SECTION LIX.,"fire aglow, and having the impetuosity of the great Indra’s"
5461,SECTION LIX.,"thunder-bolt, (Rāvana) hurled it in rage to compass the destruction of"
5462,SECTION LIX.,Sugriva. And even as the fierce dart discharged by Guha¹⁸⁴ had pierced
5463,SECTION LIX.,"Krauncha,¹⁸⁵ that shaft shot by Rāvana, rushing in violence at Sugriva"
5464,SECTION LIX.,"possessed of a person having the touch of Sakra’s thunder-bolt, pierced"
5465,SECTION LIX.,"it. Thereat, agonised by the shaft, that hero, with his senses"
5466,SECTION LIX.,"bewildered, dropped down to the ground with shrieks. And seeing him down"
5467,SECTION LIX.,"on the earth bereft of his senses, the Yatudhanas were filled with"
5468,SECTION LIX.,"rejoicing. And then Gavāksha and Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha, Jyotimukha"
5469,SECTION LIX.,"and Nala, uprooting crags and magnifying their bodies, rushed against"
5470,SECTION LIX.,the lord of Rākshasas. And the lord of Rākshasas with hundreds of shafts
5471,SECTION LIX.,"having sharpened heads, rendered their strokes fruitless. And then he"
5472,SECTION LIX.,rived those foremost of monkeys with showers of arrows having variegated
5473,SECTION LIX.,"golden knobs, and covered those fierce monkey-ranks with networks of"
5474,SECTION LIX.,"arrows. And on being sore assailed and falling in consequence, those"
5475,SECTION LIX.,"heroes, the monkeys, pierced with terrific arrows, and distressed with"
5476,SECTION LIX.,"the shafts of Rāvana, emitting cries, sought the shelter of Rāma worthy"
5477,SECTION LIX.,"of being sought. Then the high-souled and excellent bowman—Rāma,—taking"
5478,SECTION LIX.,"his bow, at once sallied forth. And thereat, Lakshmana, approaching"
5479,SECTION LIX.,"Rāma, with joined hands addressed him words couching prime import. ""O"
5480,SECTION LIX.,"noble one, I alone am fit to compass the destruction of this"
5481,SECTION LIX.,"wicked-minded one. I will slay him. Do thou, O master, permit me"". To"
5482,SECTION LIX.,"him replied Rāma of exceeding energy, having truth for his prowess,—""Go"
5483,SECTION LIX.,"then, O Lakshmana, and put forth thy utmost exertions in the encounter."
5484,SECTION LIX.,"Rāvana is forsooth endowed with mighty energy, and his prowess in battle"
5485,SECTION LIX.,"is wonderful. Without doubt, when enraged, he is incapable of being"
5486,SECTION LIX.,borne by this triple world. Do thou keep an eye on his shortcomings as
5487,SECTION LIX.,"thou shouldst watch thine own failings. Being always on the alert, thou"
5488,SECTION LIX.,"must with thy eyes as much as thy bow protect thyself"". Hearing"
5489,SECTION LIX.,"Rāghava’s speech, Sumitrā’s son, embracing Rāma, and saluting him and"
5490,SECTION LIX.,"paying him his respects, went forth to battle. And (going unto the"
5491,SECTION LIX.,"field), he found Rāvana, endowed with arms resembling the trunks of"
5492,SECTION LIX.,"elephants,—wielding his dreadful and flaming bow, and covering with"
5493,SECTION LIX.,"showers of arrows those monkeys, whose bodies had been swarming with"
5494,SECTION LIX.,"shafts. And seeing Rāvana, the exceedingly powerful Hanumān—son unto the"
5495,SECTION LIX.,"Wind-god—resisting that downpour of arrows, charged him vehemently. And"
5496,SECTION LIX.,"coming at his car, the intelligent Hanumān, uplifting his right arm and"
5497,SECTION LIX.,"terrifying Rāvana, said,—""Incapable of being slain by gods, Dānavas or"
5498,SECTION LIX.,"Gandharvas, Yakshas or Rākshasas,—Fear hath (at last) found thee, coming"
5499,SECTION LIX.,even from monkeys. This my upraised right arm furnished with five
5500,SECTION LIX.,"fingers, shall rob thee of thy soul long resident (in thy body)""."
5501,SECTION LIX.,"Hearing Hanumān’s speech, Rāvana possessed of dreadful prowess, with his"
5502,SECTION LIX.,"eyes reddened in wrath, said these words,—""Strike thou swift maugre"
5503,SECTION LIX.,"fear; and acquire lasting renown. And, O monkey, having (at first) taken"
5504,SECTION LIX.,"the measure of thy might, will I finish thee"". Hearing Rāvana’s words,"
5505,SECTION LIX.,"the offspring of the Wind-god said,—""(First) remember thou thy"
5506,SECTION LIX.,"son—Aksha—slaughtered by me!"" Thus addressed, the exceedingly energetic"
5507,SECTION LIX.,lord of the Rākshasas possessed of prowess dealt a slap unto the
5508,SECTION LIX.,"offspring of the Wind-god. And struck with his slap, he shook"
5509,SECTION LIX.,"momentarily. And staying for a moment and calling up fortitude, that"
5510,SECTION LIX.,magnanimous one administered a slap unto the foe of the immortals. And
5511,SECTION LIX.,"hit by the highsouled monkey, the Ten-necked one trembled, as trembleth"
5512,SECTION LIX.,a mountain during an earthquake. And witnessing Rāvana struck with a
5513,SECTION LIX.,slap (by Hanumān) saints and Siddhas and celestials and the Asuras
5514,SECTION LIX.,"shouted in glee. Then attaining a little respite, Rāvana said,—""Well"
5515,SECTION LIX.,"done, O monkey. In prowess thou art a foe I pride in"". Thus addressed by"
5516,SECTION LIX.,"Rāvana, the Wind-god’s son said,—""Fie on my prowess, seeing that thou"
5517,SECTION LIX.,"breathest yet, O Rāvana. Strike at the same time, O perverse one. Why"
5518,SECTION LIX.,dost thou bluster? And then my blow shall despatch thee to the mansions
5519,SECTION LIX.,"of Yama"". And at the speech of the Wind-god’s son, his ire flamed up."
5520,SECTION LIX.,"And then that one endowed with prowess, clenching his right fist"
5521,SECTION LIX.,"carefully, let it alight amain on the monkey’s chest. And hit at his"
5522,SECTION LIX.,"spacious chest, Hanumān shook over and over again. And seeing the mighty"
5523,SECTION LIX.,"Hanumān overwhelmed, that powerful car-warrior ascended on his car,"
5524,SECTION LIX.,approached Nila. And the powerful lord of Rākshasas—the Ten-necked
5525,SECTION LIX.,one—made that general of forces—Nila—aflame with dreadful shafts
5526,SECTION LIX.,"entering into the vitals, resembling snakes. And assailed with shafts,"
5527,SECTION LIX.,Nila—leader of monkeys—with one arm took up a mountain-top and hurled it
5528,SECTION LIX.,"at the lord of Rakshas. And the energetic and high-minded Hanumān,"
5529,SECTION LIX.,"attaining respite, eager for encounter, seeing (the fight between the"
5530,SECTION LIX.,"Rākshasa and the monkey), wrought up with rage, said,—""It is not meet"
5531,SECTION LIX.,"for me to attack Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—engaged with Nila"". And the"
5532,SECTION LIX.,"highly powerful Rāvana, by means of seven shafts with sharpened points,"
5533,SECTION LIX.,"hit at the mountain-top; and shivered in pieces, it fell (to the earth)."
5534,SECTION LIX.,"And seeing that mountain peak shattered, that general of the"
5535,SECTION LIX.,monkey-forces—slayer of hostile heroes—flamed up in wrath like the fire
5536,SECTION LIX.,at the universal wreck. And in that encounter Nila discharged Açwakarna
5537,SECTION LIX.,"trees, and _Sālas_, and mangoes in full flower, and various other trees."
5538,SECTION LIX.,"And Rāvana, getting at the trees, severed them (by means of his arrows),"
5539,SECTION LIX.,and poured on the Fire-god’s son terrific showers of shafts. And
5540,SECTION LIX.,"assailed with fearful showers of arrows as with a mass of clouds, that"
5541,SECTION LIX.,"one endowed with eminent strength, decreasing his dimensions, dropped on"
5542,SECTION LIX.,the top of Rāvana’s banner. And seeing the son of the Fire-god descend
5543,SECTION LIX.,"on the top of his banner. Rāvana was fired with ire, and Nila shouted"
5544,SECTION LIX.,"(thereat). And seeing the monkey (now) at the top of the banner, and"
5545,SECTION LIX.,"(now) at the end of his bow, and (now) at the crest of his tiara,"
5546,SECTION LIX.,Lakshmana and Hanumān and Rāma were struck with astonishment. And also
5547,SECTION LIX.,"Rāvana endowed with exceeding energy, astonished at the lightness of the"
5548,SECTION LIX.,"monkey, took up a wonderful flaming fiery weapon. And the monkeys seeing"
5549,SECTION LIX.,"Rāvana bewildered, and delighted thereat, set up shouts. And Rāvana"
5550,SECTION LIX.,"encaged at the shouts of the monkeys, with his heart overwhelmed with"
5551,SECTION LIX.,"agitation, could not address himself to any effort. And then taking a"
5552,SECTION LIX.,"fiery shaft and setting the same on his bow, the night-ranger gazed at"
5553,SECTION LIX.,"Nila. And the exceedingly energetic lord of the Rākshasas said,—""O"
5554,SECTION LIX.,"monkey, by virtue of thy skill in illusion, thou art furnished with"
5555,SECTION LIX.,"lightness. But, O monkey, if thou canst, preserve thy life. Thou"
5556,SECTION LIX.,transformest thyself into many shapes. Yet this shaft of mine discharged
5557,SECTION LIX.,"from my weapon, shall deprive of thy life thee that art preserving it""."
5558,SECTION LIX.,"Having said this, the mighty-armed Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—fixing"
5559,SECTION LIX.,"his shaft on his bow, shot it at the general. And Nila, struck at the"
5560,SECTION LIX.,"chest with that arrow, which had been shot (by Rāvana), burning,"
5561,SECTION LIX.,suddenly fell down to the earth. And by virtue of the greatness of his
5562,SECTION LIX.,"sire and also of his own energy, he went to the earth on his knees, but"
5563,SECTION LIX.,was not utterly deprived of life. And seeing the monkey deprived of his
5564,SECTION LIX.,"senses, the Ten-necked one, eager for encounter, riding a car emitting a"
5565,SECTION LIX.,"rattle resembling the rumbling of clouds, darted against Sumitrā’s son."
5566,SECTION LIX.,"And entering into the arena of fight and posted there flaming, the"
5567,SECTION LIX.,"powerful lord of the Rākshasas, baffling (the foe), kept stretching his"
5568,SECTION LIX.,"bow. And as that one of immeasurable prowess kept stretching his bow,"
5569,SECTION LIX.,"Sumitrā’s son of unflagging mettle, addressed him, saying,—""O lord of"
5570,SECTION LIX.,"night-rangers, do thou to-day try me in encounter. Thou ought not to"
5571,SECTION LIX.,"strive with the monkeys"". And hearing Saumitri’s speech uttered in a"
5572,SECTION LIX.,"full voice, as well as the terrific twangs of his. bow-string, that"
5573,SECTION LIX.,"Raksha—the king—approaching Sumitrā’s son staying in the field, spoke"
5574,SECTION LIX.,"unto him wrathfully,—""O Raghu’s son, by my luck hast thou of perverse"
5575,SECTION LIX.,"sense, finding thy fate come within the range of my ken. This very"
5576,SECTION LIX.,"instant, tormented with the springes of my shafts, thou wilt repair to"
5577,SECTION LIX.,"the regions of Death"". Thereat, Sumitrā’s son, without being overwhelmed"
5578,SECTION LIX.,"with wonder (on witnessing Rāvana’s prowess), addressed that one"
5579,SECTION LIX.,"furnished with large and sharp teeth,—setting up roars,—""O king, those"
5580,SECTION LIX.,"who are (really) endowed with prowess, do not storm. O prince of"
5581,SECTION LIX.,"sinners, in vain thou vauntest. O lord of Rākshasas, I know thy prowess"
5582,SECTION LIX.,"and strength and energy and vigor. Here am I stationed, bow and shafts"
5583,SECTION LIX.,"in hand. Come thou. What is the use of vain-glorious self-laudation?"""
5584,SECTION LIX.,"Thus accosted, the Raksha monarch, growing wroth, discharged seven"
5585,SECTION LIX.,shafts furnished with knobs. Thereupon Lakshmana split them up with
5586,SECTION LIX.,sharp-pointed arrows having variegated golden knobs. And they suddenly
5587,SECTION LIX.,"severed like powerful serpents cut off, Lankā’s lord came under the sway"
5588,SECTION LIX.,"of passion, and discharged other whetted arrows. And Rāma’s younger"
5589,SECTION LIX.,"brother poured showers of arrows from his bow; and, planting himself at"
5590,SECTION LIX.,"his post, cut off those arrows (of his adversary) by means of razors,"
5591,SECTION LIX.,"and crescents, and excellent _karnas_ and darts. And seeing his arrowy"
5592,SECTION LIX.,"net-works rendered ineffectual, that enemy of the celestials—the"
5593,SECTION LIX.,"king—was seized with wonderment, and again shot sharpened arrows. And"
5594,SECTION LIX.,"Lakshmana also, resembling Indra the Great, setting on his bow"
5595,SECTION LIX.,"sharpened, sharp-pointed, flaming, and luminous shafts, endowed with the"
5596,SECTION LIX.,"dreadful vehement impetus of the thunder-bolt, discharged (them), to"
5597,SECTION LIX.,compass the destruction of the lord of Rakshas. And thereat the Rākshasa
5598,SECTION LIX.,sovereign cut off those whetted arrows; and smote Lakshmana in the
5599,SECTION LIX.,"forehead with an arrow resembling the Fire of Dooms-day in energy,—which"
5600,SECTION LIX.,"had been conferred on him by the Self-create. And Lakshmana, tortured"
5601,SECTION LIX.,"with Rāvana’s arrow, shook, loosely holding his bow; and then recovering"
5602,SECTION LIX.,"his consciousness after undergoing extreme agony, he severed the bow of"
5603,SECTION LIX.,"the foe of the foremost of celestials. And having cut off Rāvana’s bow,"
5604,SECTION LIX.,Daçarathas son hit (him) with three sharp-pointed arrows. And the king
5605,SECTION LIX.,"smarting under the shafts, with much ado regained his consciousness. And"
5606,SECTION LIX.,"the enemy of the immortals of terrific power with his bow severed, and"
5607,SECTION LIX.,"himself hit with shafts, and his body covered with fat, and himself"
5608,SECTION LIX.,"washed in blood, took up a dart conferred on him by the Self-create. And"
5609,SECTION LIX.,the sovereign of the Rākshasas and their lord in that encounter hurled
5610,SECTION LIX.,"at Sumitrā’s son the dart resembling smoking fire, sending up living"
5611,SECTION LIX.,"flames, and striking terror into the monkeys. And as it coursed on,"
5612,SECTION LIX.,Bharata’s younger brother resisted it with arrows resembling a
5613,SECTION LIX.,sacrificial flame. Yet the dart pierced into the broad arm¹⁸⁶ of
5614,SECTION LIX.,"Daçaratha’s son. And smit with the dart, that hero of the Raghu race,"
5615,SECTION LIX.,"although possessed of strength, was aglow. And the king at once with his"
5616,SECTION LIX.,"arms seized that one, who had been deprived of his senses. But he that"
5617,SECTION LIX.,could with his arms wield Himavān or Mandara or Meru or the triple world
5618,SECTION LIX.,"itself along with the immortals, could not (for all his strength) lift"
5619,SECTION LIX.,up Bharata’s younger brother. And hit at his chest by the dart of
5620,SECTION LIX.,"Brahma, Sumitrā’s son remembered that he was verily a portion of Vishnu"
5621,SECTION LIX.,himself. And pressing hard Sumitrā’s son—that humbler of the hauteur of
5622,SECTION LIX.,"the Daityas, that thorn in the sides of the celestials—could not move"
5623,SECTION LIX.,him (from his place). And then the Wind-god’s offspring waxing wroth
5624,SECTION LIX.,"rushed at Rāvana, and overwhelmed with rage smote at his chest with his"
5625,SECTION LIX.,"clenched fist resembling the thunder-bolt. And boxed (by Hanumāna),"
5626,SECTION LIX.,"Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—went down to the ground on his knees, and"
5627,SECTION LIX.,shook and dropped to the earth. And blood gushed out in streams from his
5628,SECTION LIX.,"mouths and eyes and arms; and staggered and senseless, he sat down on"
5629,SECTION LIX.,the platform of his car. And he was rendered insensible with his senses
5630,SECTION LIX.,lost; and he knew not where he was. And seeing Rāvana endued with
5631,SECTION LIX.,"terrific prowess, rendered insensible in the encounter, saints and"
5632,SECTION LIX.,monkeys and gods with the Asuras set up shouts. And then the energetic
5633,SECTION LIX.,"Hanumān taking Lakshmana racked by Rāvana, with his arms brought him"
5634,SECTION LIX.,"before Rāghava. And albeit incapable of being moved by the foes,"
5635,SECTION LIX.,"(Lakshmana), on account of the friendship of the Wind-god’s offspring as"
5636,SECTION LIX.,"well as the high reverence in which he was held by Hanumān, became"
5637,SECTION LIX.,"extremely light to the monkey. And then that dart, renouncing Sumitrā’s"
5638,SECTION LIX.,"son vanquished in fight, again sought its place in Rāvana’s car. And the"
5639,SECTION LIX.,"exceedingly powerful Rāvana, recovering his consciousness in that dread"
5640,SECTION LIX.,"encounter, took up whetted shafts and seized a mighty bow. And that"
5641,SECTION LIX.,"finisher of foes—Lakshmana—recovered the exercise of his senses, and had"
5642,SECTION LIX.,"his entire person perfectly healed,—on his recalling that he verily was"
5643,SECTION LIX.,a part and parcel of Vishnu himself. And witnessing the mighty army of
5644,SECTION LIX.,"the monkeys and the redoubted heroes brought down in the conflict,"
5645,SECTION LIX.,"Rāghava rushed at Rāvana. Thereat drawing near to him, Hanumān said unto"
5646,SECTION LIX.,"him,—""It behoveth thee to chastise the foe ascending my back, even as"
5647,SECTION LIX.,"Vishnu chastiseth the enemies of the immortals, riding Garutman""."
5648,SECTION LIX.,"Hearing the words spoken by Hanumān, Rāghava at once got up on that"
5649,SECTION LIX.,gigantic monkey; and that master of men beheld Rāvana in battle. And
5650,SECTION LIX.,"seeing him, that highly powerful one darted against Rāvana, even as the"
5651,SECTION LIX.,"enraged Vishnu had rushed against Virochana’s son,¹⁸⁷ upraising his"
5652,SECTION LIX.,weapons. And he sharply twanged his bow-string sounding like the
5653,SECTION LIX.,"terrific crash of thunder; and then in solemn tones, Rāma addressed the"
5654,SECTION LIX.,"lord of Rākshasas, saying,—""Stay, stay, having done me such wrong."
5655,SECTION LIX.,"Repairing whither, shalt thou, O powerful Rākshasa, attain respite? Even"
5656,SECTION LIX.,if thou shouldst seek Yama or Indra or the Sun—son unto Vivaçwān—or the
5657,SECTION LIX.,"Self-sprung or the Fire-god or Sankara himself,—or go to the ten"
5658,SECTION LIX.,"cardinal points in ten portions,—yet shalt thou not, so resorting,"
5659,SECTION LIX.,"attain deliverance. And (Lakshmana), going forth to the fight, hath been"
5660,SECTION LIX.,"wounded with the dart and hath suddenly been stupified. But, O king of"
5661,SECTION LIX.,"the Rakshas, to-day in conflict Death shall claim for his own thee and"
5662,SECTION LIX.,thy sons and grandsons. By me with my shafts have been slaughtered four
5663,SECTION LIX.,"and ten thousand Rakshas residing in Janasthāna, wielding excellent"
5664,SECTION LIX.,"weapons"". Hearing Rāghava’s words, the exceedingly strong lord of the"
5665,SECTION LIX.,"Rākshasas, overwhelmed with a mighty wrath, recalling enmity agone, with"
5666,SECTION LIX.,burning shafts resembling the fire of Doom hit in encounter the
5667,SECTION LIX.,"exceedingly impetuous offspring of the Wind-god, who was bearing"
5668,SECTION LIX.,"Rāghava. And although struck and resisted by the Rākshasa with arrows,"
5669,SECTION LIX.,"the energy of that one, endowed by nature with prowess—increased"
5670,SECTION LIX.,"greatly. And the exceedingly energetic Rāma, on seeing that foremost of"
5671,SECTION LIX.,"the monkeys wounded by Rāvana, was mastered by wrath. And Rāma, closing"
5672,SECTION LIX.,"with his enemy, by means of whetted arrow-points severed in pieces his"
5673,SECTION LIX.,"car together with the wheels and the steeds, the banner, the umbrella,"
5674,SECTION LIX.,"and the majestic streamer, as well as with the charioteer and the"
5675,SECTION LIX.,thunder-bolts and darts and swords. And then as the reverend Indra
5676,SECTION LIX.,"cleaveth Meru with his thunder-bolt, (Rāghava) swiftly smote on Rāvana’s"
5677,SECTION LIX.,spacious and shapely chest with a shaft resembling Vajra and the thunder
5678,SECTION LIX.,holt. And—that the king hero—who had not smarted nor shaken under the
5679,SECTION LIX.,"impetus of Vajra and the thunder-bolt,—assailed with the arrow of Rāma"
5680,SECTION LIX.,"and agonised in consequence, shook and lost hold of his bow. And seeing"
5681,SECTION LIX.,"him overwhelmed, Rāma took up a flaming half-moon, and with the same at"
5682,SECTION LIX.,once severed the sun-bright tiara of the high-souled sovereign of the
5683,SECTION LIX.,"Rākshasas. And Rāma in the encounter addressed the lord of Rākshasas,"
5684,SECTION LIX.,"resembling a serpent bereft of venom, shorn of his splendour, like unto"
5685,SECTION LIX.,"the sun shrouded (in mist),—without his wonted grace, and having his"
5686,SECTION LIX.,"entire tiara riven—saying,—""Thou hast (in battle) performed high and"
5687,SECTION LIX.,"dreadful deeds,—and hast also (in the conflict) slain my foremost"
5688,SECTION LIX.,heroes. And therefore I know thou art fatigued. And for this reason it
5689,SECTION LIX.,is that I will not with my shafts bring thee to the door of Death. Go
5690,SECTION LIX.,"thou. I know¹⁸⁸ that thou art worn out with fight. Therefore, O king of"
5691,SECTION LIX.,"night-rangers, enter Lankā. Having a little respite, do thou depart on"
5692,SECTION LIX.,"thy car along with thy bowmen. Afterwards, mounted on thy car, shalt"
5693,SECTION LIX.,"thou behold my power"". And thus addressed, the king, with his pride and"
5694,SECTION LIX.,"joy defeated, with his bow severed, and his steeds and charioteer"
5695,SECTION LIX.,"killed, himself smarting under shafts,—and having his crown"
5696,SECTION LIX.,"splintered,—speedily entered Lankā. And on that foe of the deities and"
5697,SECTION LIX.,the Dānavas—the puissant lord of the night-rangers—entering (into
5698,SECTION LIX.,"Lankā), Rāma rendered the monkeys along with Lakshmana hale in that"
5699,SECTION LIX.,"fierce conflict. And at the break-down of that foe of the immortals, the"
5700,SECTION LIX.,"celestials and the Asuras, the ghosts and the Cardinal points, and all"
5701,SECTION LIX.,the mighty serpents together with the oceans and the creatures
5702,SECTION LIX.,"inhabiting earth and water, felt exceedingly delighted."

5737,SECTION LX.,remembering Rāghava’s arrows resembling a comet risen at the universal
5738,SECTION LX.,"wreck, and of the splendour of live lightning, the Rākshasa-chief was"
5739,SECTION LX.,"aggrieved. And seated on a superb golden seat, Rāma, eying the"
5740,SECTION LX.,"Rākshasas, spoke,—""Forsooth all the austere asceticism I have performed"
5741,SECTION LX.,"goeth for nothing, for although resembling the redoubtable Indra, I have"
5742,SECTION LX.,been overcome by a mortal. And this dire speech of Brahma also reverts
5743,SECTION LX.,"to my remembrance,—’Know thou that thy fear cometh from a human being."
5744,SECTION LX.,"Thou art incapable of being slain by deities and Dānavas, Gandharvas,"
5745,SECTION LX.,"Yakshas, Rākshasas and serpents. But thou hast not asked for immunity"

5747,SECTION LX.,fear. And I was formerly cursed by that lord of the Ikshwaku
5748,SECTION LX.,"line—Anaranya—saying,—’O worst of Rākshasas, a person shall spring in my"
5749,SECTION LX.,"race, who, O wicked-minded one, shall slay thee in battle along with thy"
5750,SECTION LX.,sons and courtiers and forces and horses and charioteers.’ And I was
5751,SECTION LX.,"also cursed by Vedavati, who was formerly outraged by me. And she is"
5752,SECTION LX.,(perchance) born as the exalted daughter of Janaka. And what had also
5753,SECTION LX.,"been uttered by Umā and Nandiçwara and Rambha and Varuna’s daughter,¹⁸⁹"

5757,SECTION LX.,"deities and the Dānavas—Kumbhakarna, endowed with unparalleled gravity,"
5758,SECTION LX.,"overwhelmed with the curse of Brahmā"". And seeing himself worsted and"

5770,SECTION LX.,"he doth not help me in such high peril, what shall I do with his"
5771,SECTION LX.,"strength resembling the strength of Sakra himself?"" Hearing the speech"
5772,SECTION LX.,"of the lord of the Rākshasas, the Rākshasas, bestirring themselves, went"
5773,SECTION LX.,"to the abode of Kumbhakarna. And desired by Rāvana, those feeding on"
5774,SECTION LX.,"flesh and blood went off hurriedly, taking perfumes and wreaths and a"
5775,SECTION LX.,mass of food. And entering Kumbhakarna’s charming cave having a wide
5776,SECTION LX.,"gateway, measuring a _yojana_ breathing around perfumes of"
5777,SECTION LX.,"flowers,—those highly powerful ones, pushed off by Kumbhakarna’s breath,"
5778,SECTION LX.,with the utmost energy they could summon up stood their ground and
5779,SECTION LX.,entered the cave. And then entering that charming cave having floors
5780,SECTION LX.,"paved with gold and gems, those Nairitas endowed with great strength,"
5781,SECTION LX.,"saw that one of dreadful prowess, lying down. And then they together set"
5782,SECTION LX.,about waking up the slumbering Kumbhakarna looking like a hill
5783,SECTION LX.,"extended,—and sunk in profound slumber; with his body having its down"
5784,SECTION LX.,standing on end; lying down; like a sighing serpent; rolling people¹⁹¹
5785,SECTION LX.,"with his powerful breath,—reposing; possessed of dreadful prowess;"
5786,SECTION LX.,having a huge nose; of a person vast as the nether sphere; lying
5787,SECTION LX.,stretched at length; smelling of fat and blood; decked with golden
5788,SECTION LX.,_angadas_; and waring a diadem endowed with the splendour of the Sun.
5789,SECTION LX.,And (they) saw that subduer of enemies and foremost of
5790,SECTION LX.,Nairitas—Kumbhakarna. And then they piled up Meru-like animals for
5791,SECTION LX.,"conferring rare gratification, and heaps of deer and buffaloes and"
5792,SECTION LX.,boars. And the Rākshasas made an astounding heap of rice. And then the
5793,SECTION LX.,enemies of the immortals put up before Kumbhakarna jars of blood and
5794,SECTION LX.,"various kinds of food, and smeared that repressor of foes with excellent"
5795,SECTION LX.,"sandal, and made him inhale perfumes and the aroma of wreaths. And they"
5796,SECTION LX.,"made (the place) rife with the incense of _dhupa_, and extolled that"
5797,SECTION LX.,smiter of enemies. And then the Yātudhānas roared around here and there
5798,SECTION LX.,like clouds. And they winded conchs beaming moon-like. And they
5799,SECTION LX.,incapable of being beaten shouted in full chorus. And the night-rangers
5800,SECTION LX.,shouted and struck at their arms with their hands and began to pull him.
5801,SECTION LX.,"And for rousing Kumbhakarna, mighty was the din that they raised. And"
5802,SECTION LX.,hearing those loud sounds of conchs and drums and _panavas_; and those
5803,SECTION LX.,proceeding from persons striking at their arms with their hands; and
5804,SECTION LX.,"leonine roars,—rushing on all sides and riving the very heavens,—birds"
5805,SECTION LX.,suddenly dropped down. And when the high-souled Kumbhakarna sleeping
5806,SECTION LX.,"soundly did not awake at that terrific tumult, the Rākshasas took up"
5807,SECTION LX.,"_Bhushandis_¹⁹² and maces. And then the Rākshasas, drawing near, smote"
5808,SECTION LX.,"Kumbhakarna sleeping sweetly in the chest with mountain-peaks, maces and"
5809,SECTION LX.,clubs. But the Rākshasas could not stay before Kumbhakarna owing to the
5810,SECTION LX.,hurricane heaving at his breath. Then tightening their cloth¹⁹³ (about
5811,SECTION LX.,"their waist), those Rākshasas of dreadful prowess sounded _mridangas_"
5812,SECTION LX.,"and _panavas_, conchs and kumbhas. And ten thousand Rākshasas together"
5813,SECTION LX.,surrounded that one resembling a heap of dark-blue collyrium and fell to
5814,SECTION LX.,"rousing him. But albeit assailed with shouts and smit with weapons, he"
5815,SECTION LX.,"did not wake up. And when they succeeded not in rousing him, they more"
5816,SECTION LX.,than ever exerted themselves. And then they smote him with horses and
5817,SECTION LX.,"camels, and mules and snakes, rods and lashes and hooks, and with might"
5818,SECTION LX.,and main sounded kettledrums and conchs and _mridangas_. And they struck
5819,SECTION LX.,his body with innumerable huge blocks of wood. And summoning up their
5820,SECTION LX.,"dearest energy, they dealt him blows with maces and clubs. And at that"
5821,SECTION LX.,"mighty uproar, entire Lankā was filled with her woods and hills; yet he"
5822,SECTION LX.,did not wake up. And then they simultaneously sounded a thousand
5823,SECTION LX.,kettle-drums beaten with sticks of polished gold. And coming under the
5824,SECTION LX.,"sway of the curse,¹⁹⁴ when that one sunk in slumber did not wake up, the"
5825,SECTION LX.,"night-rangers were wrought up with wrath. And overcome with choler, they"
5826,SECTION LX.,endowed with dreadful prowess addressed themselves vigorously to
5827,SECTION LX.,awakening him; and others put forth their energy. And others smote the
5828,SECTION LX.,"kettle-drums, and others set up loud cries. And others cut off his hair,"
5829,SECTION LX.,and others bit his ears. And others poured into his ears a thousand
5830,SECTION LX.,vessels of water. But Kumbhakarna come under the spell of a mighty
5831,SECTION LX.,slumber did not wink. And others—strong ones—armed with poniards
5832,SECTION LX.,"(_kutas_) and maces, made their poniards and maces alight on his person."
5833,SECTION LX.,"And struck with _sataghnis_ bound with cords,¹⁹⁵ that huge-bodied one"
5834,SECTION LX.,did not wake up. And then when a thousand elephants rushed against his
5835,SECTION LX.,"body, recovering his consciousness, he awoke. And assailed with"
5836,SECTION LX.,"mountain-peaks and trees descending on his body, he, without minding"
5837,SECTION LX.,"those tremendous blows,—on sleep having been dispelled, suddenly got up,"
5838,SECTION LX.,"yawning,—suffering the pangs of hunger. And then that night-ranger"
5839,SECTION LX.,"resembling an elephant or a serpent or a mountain-peak, casting about"
5840,SECTION LX.,"his arms superior in force to the thunder-bolt itself, and opening his"
5841,SECTION LX.,"deformed mouth like unto that of a mule, yawned (again and again). And"
5842,SECTION LX.,"as he yawned, his mouth resembling the subterraneous regions, looked"
5843,SECTION LX.,like the Sun stationed at the summit of Meru. And that night-ranger
5844,SECTION LX.,"possessed of unwieldly strength woke up, yawning. And the breath that he"
5845,SECTION LX.,"breathed resembled a storm raging in a mountain. And then as he sat up,"
5846,SECTION LX.,Kumbhakarna’s form appeared like that of the Destroyer himself at the
5847,SECTION LX.,"universal wreck,—intent upon consuming all creatures. And the large eyes"
5848,SECTION LX.,"of that one, resembling a live flame and endowed with the splendour of"
5849,SECTION LX.,"lightning, appeared like a pair of glowing planets. And then they"
5850,SECTION LX.,"pointed unto him all those heaps of edibles, various and profuse,—bears"
5851,SECTION LX.,"and buffaloes,—and that powerful (Rākshasa) fell to. And hungering, he"
5852,SECTION LX.,"fed on flesh and athirst, drank blood. And then that enemy of Sakra"
5853,SECTION LX.,"drank vesselfuls of fat and blood. And concluding that he was replete,"
5854,SECTION LX.,"the night rangers came up; and bowing down their heads, stood circling"
5855,SECTION LX.,him on all sides. And then with his eyes discolored and drooping from
5856,SECTION LX.,"drowsiness, he casting his eyes around, addressed those night-rangers."
5857,SECTION LX.,And that foremost of Nairitas cheered all those Nairitas; and surprised
5858,SECTION LX.,"at his having been roused,—spoke unto the Rākshasas,—""Why, being"
5859,SECTION LX.,"honored, have I been awakened by you? Is it well with the king? Or hath"
5860,SECTION LX.,any fear sprung up here? Or hath a mighty fear presented itself forsooth
5861,SECTION LX.,from among others; for which I have been speedily awakened by you? This
5862,SECTION LX.,very day will I uproot quite the fear of the sovereign of the Rākshasas.
5863,SECTION LX.,"I will split up the great Indra himself,—or make Fire himself give up"
5864,SECTION LX.,his heat. One doth not awaken my like for a light cause. Therefore do ye
5865,SECTION LX.,"give the real truth of the cause of your awakening me"". Thereat a"
5866,SECTION LX.,"minister of the king, named Yupāksha, with joined hands said unto that"
5867,SECTION LX.,"humbler of foes—Kumbhakarna—wrought up with wrath, who was thus"
5868,SECTION LX.,"speaking,—""No fear anywise springs to us from the Deities. But, O king,"
5869,SECTION LX.,"a great fear doth cross us, coming from a mortal. And never fear so"
5870,SECTION LX.,"cometh unto us anywise from Daityas or Dānavas, as it hath arrived from"
5871,SECTION LX.,"a man, O king. This Lankā hath been hemmed in by monkeys resembling"
5872,SECTION LX.,mountains. And terrific is the terror that cometh even from Rāma
5873,SECTION LX.,scorched with fire springing from the ravishment of Sitā. Ere this by a
5874,SECTION LX.,single monkey was this splendid city burnt down. And the prince Aksha
5875,SECTION LX.,hath been slain along with his following and elephants. And that thorn
5876,SECTION LX.,"in the sides of deities, that lord of the Rākshasas—Pulasta’s son"
5877,SECTION LX.,himself—hath been set free in conflict by Rāghava endowed with the
5878,SECTION LX.,"splendour of the Sun,—saying—-’Go thou.’ And what had been done unto the"
5879,SECTION LX.,"king by neither the gods nor the Daityas nor yet the Dānavas, hath been"
5880,SECTION LX.,"done by Rāma; and he hath been set free, having come to a pass"
5881,SECTION LX.,"imperilling his life"". Hearing Yupāksha’s speech and hearing of the"
5882,SECTION LX.,"defeat of his brother, Kumbhakarna, with his eyes whirling, spoke unto"
5883,SECTION LX.,"him, saying,—""To day, O Yupāksha, after vanquishing in battle the"
5884,SECTION LX.,"monkey-army together with Lakshmana and Rāghava, shall I see Rāvana. And"
5885,SECTION LX.,"I shall regale the Rākshasas with the flesh and blood of the monkeys,"
5886,SECTION LX.,"and myself drink the blood of Rāma and Lakshmana"". Hearing his words as"
5887,SECTION LX.,"he haughtily spoke thus with his spirit of insolence magnified by much,"
5888,SECTION LX.,"that foremost of the Nairita soldiers, Mahodara, with joined hands"
5889,SECTION LX.,"observed,—""O long-armed one, having at first heard Rāvana’s words and"
5890,SECTION LX.,"considered their justice or otherwise, thou wilt afterwards defeat the"
5891,SECTION LX.,"foe in fight"". Hearing Mahodara’s words, the exceedingly energetic and"
5892,SECTION LX.,"mighty (Kumbhakarna) surrounded by the Rākshasas, prepared to depart."
5893,SECTION LX.,And having roused from his slumbers that one of terrific prowess having
5894,SECTION LX.,"dreadful eyes,—the Rākshasas speedily arrived at the residence of the"
5895,SECTION LX.,Ten-necked one. And presenting themselves before the Ten-necked one
5896,SECTION LX.,"seated on a superb seat, all the night-rangers spoke with joined"
5897,SECTION LX.,"hands,—""O lord of the Rākshasas, thy brother, Kumbhakarna, hath been"
5898,SECTION LX.,"roused. Shall he march from there; or wilt thou see him come here?"""
5899,SECTION LX.,"Thereat, Rāvana, pleased, spoke unto those Rākshasas who had presented"
5900,SECTION LX.,"themselves,—""I wish to see him here, and do ye honor him fittingly""."
5901,SECTION LX.,"Thereat, saying ’So be it’, the Rākshasas, directed by Rāvana, going"
5902,SECTION LX.,"back, spoke unto Kumbhakarna,—""That foremost of all the Rākshasas—the"
5903,SECTION LX.,"king—wisheth to see thee. So mind thou going, and gladden thy brother""."
5904,SECTION LX.,"And the irrepressible Kumbhakarna possessed of prodigious prowess,"
5905,SECTION LX.,"learning the mandate of his brother, saying,—’So be it,’—rose up from"
5906,SECTION LX.,"his bed. And washing his face, and having bathed, that one, feeling"
5907,SECTION LX.,"refreshed and enjoying exceeding exhilaration of spirit,—wishing to"
5908,SECTION LX.,"drink, urged (the Rākshasas) to bring the nerve-conferring draught. And"
5909,SECTION LX.,"then the Rākshasas, at the command of Rāvana speedily procured wine and"
5910,SECTION LX.,various kinds of viands. And having drunk two thousand vessels (of
5911,SECTION LX.,"wine), he prepared to go. And slightly swolen and flushed, Kumbhakarna,"
5912,SECTION LX.,"attaining access of strength and fire, waxed wroth, and resembled the"
5913,SECTION LX.,Doom and Destroyer—Yama himself. And striding to the residence of his
5914,SECTION LX.,"brother backed by the Raksha force, Kumbhakarna shook the earth with his"
5915,SECTION LX.,"tread. And illuming the highway with the splendour of his person, like"
5916,SECTION LX.,"the thousand-rayed (Sun) discovering the earth with his rays,"
5917,SECTION LX.,"(Kumbhakarna) went on, engirt around by joined hands resembling"
5918,SECTION LX.,"wreaths,—like Satakratu¹⁹⁶ going to the abode of the Self-sprung. And"
5919,SECTION LX.,"suddenly seeing that slayer of foes of immeasurable prowess, resembling"
5920,SECTION LX.,"a mountain-summit,—walking along the highways, the wood-rangers"
5921,SECTION LX.,"stationed outside (the monkey-camp), along with the leaders of bands,"
5922,SECTION LX.,"were seized with affright. And then some sought the shelter of Rāma,"
5923,SECTION LX.,"worthy of being so sought; and some, stricken (with panic), dropped to"
5924,SECTION LX.,"the earth; and some, suffering (from fear), lied to the cardinal points;"
5925,SECTION LX.,and some through stress (of apprehension) lay down on the ground. And

5928,SECTION LX.,"and wonderful to behold,—the wood-rangers, tormented with fright, began"

5971,SECTION LXI.,looking like a hill? And in Lankā the hero appeareth like a mass of

5977,SECTION LXI.,"battle Vivasçwata’s offspring¹⁹⁷ and Vāsava himself had been vanquished,"
5978,SECTION LXI.,this is he—the wondrous powerful Kumbhakarna—son unto Viçravān. No
5979,SECTION LXI.,"Rākshasa is there that equalleth this one in size. O Rāghava, this one"
5980,SECTION LXI.,in battle hath brought down Dānavas and Yakshas and Serpents¹⁹⁸ and
5981,SECTION LXI.,flesh-feeders and Gandharvas and Vidyādharas and Pannagas¹⁹⁹ by
5982,SECTION LXI.,thousands. The immortals themselves thinking the dart-handed and
5983,SECTION LXI.,"fierce-eyed Kumbhakarna possessed of great strength, as the Destroyer"
5984,SECTION LXI.,"himself,—were overwhelmed with stupor and were foiled in their exertions"
5985,SECTION LXI.,to slay him. The exceedingly powerful Kumbhakarna is mighty by nature:
5986,SECTION LXI.,the strength of other redoubtable Rākshasas is owing to boons obtained
5987,SECTION LXI.,"by them. As soon as this high-souled one was born and was a babe, he"
5988,SECTION LXI.,began to devour up countless creatures by the thousand. And on these
5989,SECTION LXI.,"having been devoured, creatures, afflicted with affright consequent on"
5990,SECTION LXI.,"those having been eaten up, sought the shelter of Sakra and told him"
5991,SECTION LXI.,"what had happened. And thereat the great Indra, waxing wroth, smote"

6007,SECTION LXI.,"addressed him, saying,—""Forsooth for compassing the destruction of"

6012,SECTION LXI.,"lord of creatures, thou ought not to curse thus thine own grandson. Thy"
6013,SECTION LXI.,"words will never go for naught; sleep he will, without doubt. But do"
6014,SECTION LXI.,"thou appoint a time for his sleeping and one for his awaking"". Hearing"
6015,SECTION LXI.,"Rāvana’s speech, the Self-sprung said,—""Having slept for six months, he"
6016,SECTION LXI.,"shall wake for one day. And for a single day, that hero, coming under"
6017,SECTION LXI.,"the influence of hunger, shall range the earth, opening his mouth wide"

6026,SECTION LXI.,Bibhishana’s words informed with reason and tending to the good (of the

6029,SECTION LXI.,"furnished with mountain-summits and trees and rocks, stay, occupying the"
6030,SECTION LXI.,"highways and the bridges"". Thus instructed by Rāghava, that powerful"
6031,SECTION LXI.,"monkey, Nila—general of the forces—accordingly issued his orders to the"
6032,SECTION LXI.,"monkey-hosts. And then Givāksha and Sarabha and Hanumān and Angada,"
6033,SECTION LXI.,"themselves endowed with the splendour of mountain-summits, taking up"
6034,SECTION LXI.,"mountain-tops, drew towards the gateway. And hearing Rāma’s words,²⁰³"
6035,SECTION LXI.,"the heroic monkeys inspired with intrepidity, fiercely fell on the foe"

6165,SECTION LXIII.,bethink thee of what is proper. Do thou through thy prowess assuage the
6166,SECTION LXIII.,"sorrow of mine springing from my impolitic conduct, if thou cherishest"
6167,SECTION LXIII.,"any feeling for me, if thy strength stayeth, and if thou deemest this"
6168,SECTION LXIII.,business of mine as by far more momentous unto thee. He is a friend that
6169,SECTION LXIII.,succoureth one fallen in distress and is undergoing affliction; and he
6170,SECTION LXIII.,"acts friendly that helpeth a person lapsing from the path of morality""."
6171,SECTION LXIII.,"As he was speaking thus in words sedate yet severe, Kumbhakarna,"
6172,SECTION LXIII.,"concluding that Rāvana was delighted, made his remarks mildly. And"
6173,SECTION LXIII.,"seeing his brother extremely sorry, Kumbhakarna, pacifying him, gently"
6174,SECTION LXIII.,"said,—""O king, intently hear my words, O repressor of foes! O lord of"
6175,SECTION LXIII.,"Rākshasas, banish this sorrow, and casting away thy wrath, return thou"
6176,SECTION LXIII.,"to nature. And, O king, so long as I live, thou must not suffer thy"
6177,SECTION LXIII.,heart to fare thus. Him will I slay for whom thou grievest. But whatever
6178,SECTION LXIII.,"condition thou mayst be in, I must tell what is for thy welfare; and"
6179,SECTION LXIII.,therefore from sentiment of friendship as well as from fraternal
6180,SECTION LXIII.,"affection I have spoken thus unto thee, O king. And what a friend from"
6181,SECTION LXIII.,"affection should do at a time like this, I shall do the same. See the"
6182,SECTION LXIII.,"havock I spread among the foes in fight. And, O long-armed one, behold,"
6183,SECTION LXIII.,on Rāma having been slain by me on the edge of battle along with his
6184,SECTION LXIII.,"brother, the monkey-army in headlong flight. And to-day seeing Rāma’s"
6185,SECTION LXIII.,"head brought by me from the field, be thou, O long-armed one, happy; and"
6186,SECTION LXIII.,let Sitā be overwhelmed with woe. And let those Rākshasas in Lankā who
6187,SECTION LXIII.,"have had their kindred slain (in battle), see that dear sight—Rāma slain"
6188,SECTION LXIII.,"(in fight). And to-day shall I slaying the enemies in battle, wipe the"
6189,SECTION LXIII.,tears of those who mourn their friends slain and are overwhelmed with
6190,SECTION LXIII.,grief. To-day behold the lord of monkeys—Sugriva—resembling a mountain
6191,SECTION LXIII.,"or a mass of clouds lighted up by (the living) sun,—lying stretched on"
6192,SECTION LXIII.,"the field. But why, O sinless one, albeit comforted by these Rākshasas"
6193,SECTION LXIII.,"eager for slaying Daçaratha’s son, as well as by me,—dost thou persist"
6194,SECTION LXIII.,"in thy sorrow? Rāghava forsooth shall slay thee after slaying me. But, O"
6195,SECTION LXIII.,"lord of Rākshasas, I cannot come by grief²¹³ (at Rāghava’s hands). O"
6196,SECTION LXIII.,"repressor of foes, do thou now command me, O thou of unparalleled"
6197,SECTION LXIII.,"prowess, thou needst not thyself face the foe in fight. I shall abolish"
6198,SECTION LXIII.,"thy foes endowed with redoubted might. If even Sakra himself, and Yama,"
6199,SECTION LXIII.,"and the god of Fire, and the god of Wind, and Kuvera, and Varuna—shall"
6200,SECTION LXIII.,"range themselves against me, them shall I encounter in fight. Purandara"
6201,SECTION LXIII.,"himself is seized with fright at sight of me, having a body measuring a"
6202,SECTION LXIII.,"mountain,—equipped with sharpened spears,—furnished with sharp"
6203,SECTION LXIII.,"teeth,—and setting up shouts. And who wishing to save himself shall be"
6204,SECTION LXIII.,able to stay before me as I casting away my weapons keep pounding my
6205,SECTION LXIII.,"enemies with celerity? No need of the dart, or the mace, or the sword,"
6206,SECTION LXIII.,or whetted arrows. I shall with my bare arms alone slay (Rāma) along
6207,SECTION LXIII.,"with the thunderer himself. If Rāghava bear the impetus of my blows,"
6208,SECTION LXIII.,"then shall the vollies of my shafts drink his life-blood. Why, O king,"
6209,SECTION LXIII.,"while I remain, dost thou burn in anxiety? And I am ready to sally out"
6210,SECTION LXIII.,for compassing the destruction of thine enemies. Cast off all terror of
6211,SECTION LXIII.,Rāma. I shall slay in battle Rāghava and Lakshmana and the exceedingly
6212,SECTION LXIII.,"powerful Sugriva and the Raksha-destroying Hanumān, who made Lankā"
6213,SECTION LXIII.,blaze. I shall eat up the monkeys present in the encounter. And signal
6214,SECTION LXIII.,"is the celebrity that I shall confer on thee. And, O king, if thy fear"
6215,SECTION LXIII.,"springs from Indra or the Self-create, even the immortals shall measure"
6216,SECTION LXIII.,their lengths on the earth when I am wrought with rage. And I shall
6217,SECTION LXIII.,subdue Yama himself and devour the God of Fire. And I shall bring down
6218,SECTION LXIII.,the very welkin garnished with stars. And I shall slay Satakratu and
6219,SECTION LXIII.,drink up the abode itself²¹⁴ of Varuna. And I shall crush the mountains
6220,SECTION LXIII.,and rive the earth. And to day let all creatures as they are being eaten
6221,SECTION LXIII.,"up, witness the prowess of Kumbhakarna, after he hath slept for a long"
6222,SECTION LXIII.,time. Even the celestial regions do not suffice for me as my fare. I go
6223,SECTION LXIII.,for securing felicity ushuring in pleasures plenteous flowing from the
6224,SECTION LXIII.,"destruction of Daçaratha’s son. And slaying Rāma along with Lakshmana, I"
6225,SECTION LXIII.,"shall eat up all the foremost of monkey-bands. Make merry, my king;"
6226,SECTION LXIII.,"to-day drink Vāruni. Enjoy pleasures, banishing sorrow. And to-day on my"
6227,SECTION LXIII.,"having despatched Rāma to the mansion of Yama, Sitā shall come under thy"

6272,SECTION LXIV.,hast from thy youth upwards been insolent; and thy joy is in talking

6274,SECTION LXIV.,"increase and injury,—and knoweth the duties touching season and"

6303,SECTION LXIV.,"dost thou wish to fight with him whose peer there is none among men, and"
6304,SECTION LXIV.,"who is equal to Indra and Vivaçwata himself?"" Having said this unto"
6305,SECTION LXIV.,"Kumbhakarna wrought up with wrath, Mahodara addressed that destroyer of"
6306,SECTION LXIV.,"creatures—Rāvana—in the midst of the Rākshasas,—""Having already obtained"
6307,SECTION LXIV.,"Vaidehi, why dost thou delay? If thou wishest it, Sitā shall come under"
6308,SECTION LXIV.,thy control. I have perceived a way as to how Sitā may smile upon thee.

6311,SECTION LXIV.,Vitardana—these five—are marching for compassing the destruction of
6312,SECTION LXIV.,"Rāma. And we, marching out, shall battle with Rāma, putting forth our"
6313,SECTION LXIV.,"uttermost. And if we succeed in securing victory, no expedient need we"
6314,SECTION LXIV.,resort to (or bringing Sitā round). But if our foe live after fight and
6315,SECTION LXIV.,"we also having fought the fight, then shall we do what I conceive in my"
6316,SECTION LXIV.,"mind. We shall come hither from the field, bathed in blood, and having"
6317,SECTION LXIV.,our bodies cleft with arrows marked with the name of Rāma. And we shall
6318,SECTION LXIV.,give out that both Rāma and Lakshmana have been eaten up by us. And then
6319,SECTION LXIV.,"we shall hold thy feet, saying,—’Do thou gratify us.’ Then, king, do"
6320,SECTION LXIV.,thou through Gajaskandha publish it all round that Rāma hath been slain
6321,SECTION LXIV.,"along with his brother and the army. And, O repressor of foes,"
6322,SECTION LXIV.,"(pretending to be) well pleased, do thou dispense—viands, and servants,"
6323,SECTION LXIV.,"and objects of enjoyments, and wealth unto thy retainers; and unto the"
6324,SECTION LXIV.,many heroes and warriors distribute wreaths and attires and unguents.
6325,SECTION LXIV.,"And do thou (simulating) delight, drink. And on this report—name that"
6326,SECTION LXIV.,"Rāma hath been eaten up by the Rākshasas along with his friends,—having"

6329,SECTION LXIV.,"this deceit, O king, working powerfully through Sitā’s sorrow, she,"
6330,SECTION LXIV.,"albeit unwilling, shall, having lost her lord, come under thy control."
6331,SECTION LXIV.,"Losing her charming husband, she from despair and female frailty, shall"
6332,SECTION LXIV.,"come under thy sway. Having formerly been brought up in happiness, she,"

6334,SECTION LXIV.,"now finding happiness to be in thy custody, she shall unreservedly come"
6335,SECTION LXIV.,over to thee. In my opinion this is the properest course to follow. As
6336,SECTION LXIV.,"soon as thou seest Rāma, evil shall befall thee. Remain here. Do not"
6337,SECTION LXIV.,"wish (to go to the field). By refraining from fight, thou shalt acquire"
6338,SECTION LXIV.,"great good. And, O lord of people, by conquering the foe without battle,"
6339,SECTION LXIV.,"thou without losing thy forces and putting thyself to peril, thou, O"
6340,SECTION LXIV.,"lord of earth, shalt attain fame and high religious merit, and"

6373,SECTION LXV.,"thou sayest is ever acceptable only to kings that are incompetent, and"
6374,SECTION LXV.,"foolish, pluming themselves on their knowledge. All the affairs of the"
6375,SECTION LXV.,monarch have been wrecked by you—cravens in
6376,SECTION LXV.,"fight,—sleek-tongued,—following the king (fawning) ye have made Lankā"
6377,SECTION LXV.,"contain only the king, the treasury is lean; and the forces have been"

6379,SECTION LXV.,"repairing in mighty conflict the wrong that ye have perpetrated, I am"
6380,SECTION LXV.,"about to set out for battle for routing the enemy"". Thus addressed by"

6382,SECTION LXV.,"answered,—""Sure this Mahodara is affrighted at Rāma. And therefore, my"

6384,SECTION LXV.,"have I none either in friendship or strength. Therefore, O Kumbhakarna,"
6385,SECTION LXV.,go for destroying the foe and securing celebrity. I have waked thee up
6386,SECTION LXV.,"that wast lying down, in order that thou mightst destroy the enemy. O"
6387,SECTION LXV.,"subduer of foes, perilous is the time for the Rākshasas. Go forth,"

6391,SECTION LXV.,"the breasts of Rāma and Lakshmana shall be riven"". Having spoken thus"
6392,SECTION LXV.,"unto Kumbhakarna endowed with prodigious might, that foremost of"
6393,SECTION LXV.,Rākshasas—the exceedingly energetic Rāvana—felt as if he had received
6394,SECTION LXV.,"life over again. And well acquainted with Kumbhakarna’s might, and"

6398,SECTION LXV.,"And he took a whetted dart, destructive to foes on account of its"

6404,SECTION LXV.,"of foes; the wondrous energetic Kumbhakarna spoke unto Rāvana,"
6405,SECTION LXV.,"saying,—""I shall go alone: let this mighty host remain here. To-day"

6416,SECTION LXV.,and a chain resembling the Moon. And Rāvana adorned his person with
6417,SECTION LXV.,"garlands gorgeous and fragrant, and set ear-rings to his ears. And"
6418,SECTION LXV.,"adorned with golden _angadas_ and Keyuras and other ornaments of gold,"
6419,SECTION LXV.,the large-eared Kumbhakarna appeared like a fire fed full of sacrificial
6420,SECTION LXV.,libations. And with his great dark girdle he seemed like the Mandara
6421,SECTION LXV.,fastened by the serpent on the occasion of the churning of the sea. And
6422,SECTION LXV.,"donning on his impenetrable golden mail, splendid like lightning, and"
6423,SECTION LXV.,"shining in its own brilliance, Kumbhakarna appeared like the monarch of"
6424,SECTION LXV.,mountains enveloped with evening clouds. Having all his limbs adorned

6426,SECTION LXV.,"Narāyana in elation of spirits, when he covered heaven and earth and the"

6428,SECTION LXV.,"going round him and bowing down the head unto him, that exceedingly"
6429,SECTION LXV.,powerful one went out. And Rāvana sent him with choice
6430,SECTION LXV.,"benedictions,—while he caused kettle-drums and conchs to be sounded and"
6431,SECTION LXV.,"forces equipped with excellent weapons, to accompany Kumbhakarna. And"
6432,SECTION LXV.,high-souled mighty warriors followed that foremost of heroes with
6433,SECTION LXV.,elephants and steeds and chariots sending out rattle resembling the
6434,SECTION LXV.,rumbling of thunder. And mounting serpents and camels and asses and
6435,SECTION LXV.,"lions and leopards and deer and birds, (Rākshasas) followed the grim"
6436,SECTION LXV.,"Kumbhakarna endowed with tremendous strength. And strewn with blossoms,"
6437,SECTION LXV.,"and, with an umbrella held over him, that exceedingly terrible enemy of"
6438,SECTION LXV.,"the Deities and the Dānavas, wielding a dart in his hand,—went out,"
6439,SECTION LXV.,maddened with the smell of blood. And countless footmen wondrous
6440,SECTION LXV.,"powerful and mighty and dreadful and fierce-sighted Rākshasas, carrying"
6441,SECTION LXV.,"weapons in their hands, went in his wake. The Rakshas measuring each"
6442,SECTION LXV.,"many a _vyāma_ and red-eyed, and resembling masses of dark-blue"
6443,SECTION LXV.,"collyrium,—went out upraising darts and swords and sharpened axes and"
6444,SECTION LXV.,_bhindipālas_ and _parighas_ and maces and huge _tālaskandhas_ and
6445,SECTION LXV.,irrisistible _Kshapanis_. And the exceedingly energetic Kumbhakarna
6446,SECTION LXV.,"endowed with prodigious strength sallied forth, assuming another form"
6447,SECTION LXV.,terrific and dreadful to behold. And the gigantic huge-faced and fierce
6448,SECTION LXV.,"Kumbhakarna, measuring an hundred bows in breadth and six hundred in"
6449,SECTION LXV.,"altitude, having eyes resembling car-wheels, and resembling a towering"
6450,SECTION LXV.,"hill, or a mountain burnt,—marshalling the Rakshas, said with a"
6451,SECTION LXV.,"complacent countenance,—""Like fire consuming insects, shall I to-day,"
6452,SECTION LXV.,"wrought up with wroth, burn up one by one the bands of the flower of the"
6453,SECTION LXV.,monkey-forces. But the wood-ranging monkeys have not transgressed

6456,SECTION LXV.,"Rāghava along with Lakshmana. He being slain, all are slain. Therefore"
6457,SECTION LXV.,"shall I slay him in battle"". As the Raksha—Kumbhakarna—was speaking"
6458,SECTION LXV.,"thus, the Rākshasas sent up terrific shouts, as if making the very sea"
6459,SECTION LXV.,"shake. As the intelligent Kumbhakarna sallied out speedily, dreadful"
6460,SECTION LXV.,were the omens that presented themselves on all sides. Clouds containing
6461,SECTION LXV.,meteors and lightning looked dark like asses. And the earth shook with
6462,SECTION LXV.,"her oceans and woods. And fierce jackals began to cry, opening their"
6463,SECTION LXV.,flaming mouths. And birds began to wheel at the left. And as he marched
6464,SECTION LXV.,a vulture alighted on his dart. And his left eye throbbed and his left
6465,SECTION LXV.,arm shook. And a meteor dropped down with a tremendous crash. And the
6466,SECTION LXV.,"sun was bedimmed, and the air did not blow, enhancing pleasure. But"
6467,SECTION LXV.,"without heeding these mighty omens that took place, capabale of making"
6468,SECTION LXV.,"people’s down stand on end, Kumbhakarna went out, urged on by the force"
6469,SECTION LXV.,"of the Finisher. And leaping over the wall with his legs, that one"
6470,SECTION LXV.,"resembling a mountain saw the wonderful array of the monkeys, resembling"
6471,SECTION LXV.,"clouds. And seeing that foremost of Rākshasas resembling a hill, the"
6472,SECTION LXV.,monkeys began to disperse in all the ten cardinal directions like clouds
6473,SECTION LXV.,driven by the wind. And seeing that terrific host of monkeys scattering
6474,SECTION LXV.,"in all directions, like clouds broken through (by winds), Kumbhakarna"
6475,SECTION LXV.,"possessed of the splendour of clouds, from joy, emitted roars like"
6476,SECTION LXV.,clouds. Hearing those terrible shouts like unto the roaring of clouds in
6477,SECTION LXV.,"the welkin, innumerable monkeys dropped to the earth even as _sāla_"
6478,SECTION LXV.,trees that have their roots severed. And issuing forth for destroying
6479,SECTION LXV.,"the foe, the high-souled Kumbhakarna, equipped with a tremendous"
6480,SECTION LXV.,"bludgeon, struck extreme terror into the monkey-ranks, like unto the"
6481,SECTION LXV.,Lord armed with the Fatal rod at the Universal wreck.

6491,SECTION LXVI.,
6492,SECTION LXVI.,"Having leapt over the wall, the exceedingly powerful and gigantic"
6493,SECTION LXVI.,"Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain-summit, speedily went out of the city."
6494,SECTION LXVI.,"And then he sent up a mighty shout making the sea resound, and as if"
6495,SECTION LXVI.,drowning the roar of the thunder and riving mountains. And seeing that
6496,SECTION LXVI.,"fierce-eyed one, incapable of being vanquished by Maghavān or Varuna or"
6497,SECTION LXVI.,"Yama, the monkeys began to fly away. And seeing them scamper, the king’s"
6498,SECTION LXVI.,son—Angada—said unto Nala and Nila and Gavāksha and the mighty
6499,SECTION LXVI.,"Kumuda,—""Forgetting your lineage and prowess, whither do ye, exercised"
6500,SECTION LXVI.,"with fear, fly,—like inferior monkeys? Ye amiable ones, desist. Why"
6501,SECTION LXVI.,"should ye save yourselves? This Raksha doth not come to fight,—this is"
6502,SECTION LXVI.,only a great phenomenon to affright. We shall by our vigor destroy this
6503,SECTION LXVI.,fearful phenomenon of the Rākshasas that hath presented itself.
6504,SECTION LXVI.,"Therefore, let the monkeys desist. Cheered with much ado, the monkeys"
6505,SECTION LXVI.,"rallying, took up trees and advanced to the field of fight. And ceasing"
6506,SECTION LXVI.,"from flight, the wood-rangers waxing enraged, began to assail"
6507,SECTION LXVI.,"Kumbhakarna, like unto elephants in rut. And the exceedingly strong²²¹"
6508,SECTION LXVI.,"Kumbhakarna, attacked with towering mountain-peaks and crags and trees"
6509,SECTION LXVI.,"with flowering top, did not shake. And countless crags descending on his"
6510,SECTION LXVI.,"person, were shattered; and trees with flowering tops, being broken,"
6511,SECTION LXVI.,fell down to the earth. And incapable of containing himself (through
6512,SECTION LXVI.,"rage), Kumbhakarna on his part fell to agitating the ranks of the"
6513,SECTION LXVI.,"powerful monkeys, even as a fire breaking out burneth down a forest. And"
6514,SECTION LXVI.,"many a prime monkey, crimsoned and drenched (with blood) lay down (on"
6515,SECTION LXVI.,"the ground); and many, resisted dropped to the earth, like trees bearing"
6516,SECTION LXVI.,"coppery flowers. And without looking before or after, the monkeys"
6517,SECTION LXVI.,bounded and rushed. And on being attacked by the Rākshasa with ease some
6518,SECTION LXVI.,"of those heroes dropped into the deep, and some entered the wilderness."
6519,SECTION LXVI.,And some ran by the same way by which they had crossed the ocean; and
6520,SECTION LXVI.,some with pale faces darted into downs. And some of the bears ascended
6521,SECTION LXVI.,"up trees, and some took shelter in mountains. And others dropped²²²"
6522,SECTION LXVI.,"down; and some ran on. And some fell down to the earth, and some lay"
6523,SECTION LXVI.,"insensible²²³ as if dead. Seeing the monkeys break down, Angada"
6524,SECTION LXVI.,"addressed them, saying,—""Stay we shall fight. Desist, ye monkeys. Going"
6525,SECTION LXVI.,round this Earth place find I none where ye may rest. Stop ye all. What
6526,SECTION LXVI.,"is the need of preserving your lives. Ye poltroons, if ye fly away"
6527,SECTION LXVI.,"leaving your arms behind, your wives shall deride you; and that is more"
6528,SECTION LXVI.,painful to honorable persons than death itself. Born in long and noble
6529,SECTION LXVI.,"lines, whither go ye, suffering from fear, like abject monkeys? When"
6530,SECTION LXVI.,"renouncing your prowess, ye fly away in fear, forsooth ye are base."
6531,SECTION LXVI.,Where now is gone that talk of yours anent your nobility and the welfare
6532,SECTION LXVI.,"(of your king) which you had held in society. He that liveth, despised"
6533,SECTION LXVI.,"(of all), hear the reproach of being a craven. Therefore do ye follow"
6534,SECTION LXVI.,"the way frequented by the worthy, and cast off fear. We will either lie"
6535,SECTION LXVI.,"down on the earth, being slain in consequence of our shortness of days,"
6536,SECTION LXVI.,and thus attain the region of Brahmā incapable of being attained by
6537,SECTION LXVI.,dastards; or achieve renown by slaying the foe in fight and slain in
6538,SECTION LXVI.,"battle, we shall enjoy the wealth of the region of heroes. Like an"
6539,SECTION LXVI.,"insect coming to a glowing and flaming fire, Kumbhakarna, seeing"
6540,SECTION LXVI.,"Kākutstha, shall not away hence living. If we save our lives by flight,"
6541,SECTION LXVI.,"and if the many are brought down by one, we shall lose our fame"
6542,SECTION LXVI.,"utterly"". As Angada decked in golden _angadas_ was saying this, the"
6543,SECTION LXVI.,"monkeys, flying away spake onto that hero words not worthy of being"
6544,SECTION LXVI.,"spoken unto an hero,—""Great is the havoc that the"
6545,SECTION LXVI.,Rākshasa—Kumbhakarna—hath spread amongst us. ’Tis not the time to stay:
6546,SECTION LXVI.,"life is dear unto us"". Having said this the monkey-bands darted to the"
6547,SECTION LXVI.,ten cardinal points; as they saw that dreadful and grim-eyed one
6548,SECTION LXVI.,"approach. And as those flower of the forces were on the flight, those"
6549,SECTION LXVI.,heroes were made to desist by Angada with words of comfort and hope
6550,SECTION LXVI.,"pointing to the future. On being cheered by the intelligent son of Vāli,"
6551,SECTION LXVI.,all the monkey-bands stood expecting his commands.

6563,SECTION LXVII.,
6564,SECTION LXVII.,"And having desisted on hearing the words of Angada, those huge-bodied"
6565,SECTION LXVII.,"ones, regaining calmness, became (again) intent on fight. And attaining"
6566,SECTION LXVII.,"energy at the exhortation (of Angada), and summoning up their prowess,"
6567,SECTION LXVII.,they stayed in the field agreeably to the words of the powerful Angada.
6568,SECTION LXVII.,"And inspired with spirits, the monkeys, determined to face their fate,"
6569,SECTION LXVII.,"rushed into the conflict, and, casting away all care for their lives,"
6570,SECTION LXVII.,entered into a furious fight (with the foe). And speedily upraising
6571,SECTION LXVII.,"trees and gigantic crags, the huge-bodied monkeys charged Kumbhakarna."
6572,SECTION LXVII.,Thereat the mighty Kumbhakarna possessed of a prodigious person waxing
6573,SECTION LXVII.,"wroth, taking up his mace let the same alight on the enemies. And"
6574,SECTION LXVII.,"attacked by Kumbhakarna, seven, eight hundreds and thousands of monkeys"
6575,SECTION LXVII.,"measure their lengths on the earth. And casting about his arms, he"
6576,SECTION LXVII.,"rusheth on, devouring sixteen, eight, ten, twenty or thirty. And he"
6577,SECTION LXVII.,devoured (the monkeys) like Gāruda swallowing up serpents. And then
6578,SECTION LXVII.,"cheered up with much ado, the monkeys meeting together, and taking trees"
6579,SECTION LXVII.,"and rocks in their hands, stood their ground in the van of battle. Then"
6580,SECTION LXVII.,"uprooting a crag, Dwivida—foremost of monkeys—resembling an extended"
6581,SECTION LXVII.,mass of clouds rushed against (Kumbhakarna) having the aspect of a
6582,SECTION LXVII.,"mountain-summit. And uprooting it, the monkey hurled it at Kumbhakarna."
6583,SECTION LXVII.,"And without descending on him, the crag fell down amidst the army, and"
6584,SECTION LXVII.,smashed steeds and elephants and cans and choice chargers. And then
6585,SECTION LXVII.,"taking another mountain top, Dwivida hurled it at other Rakshas. And"
6586,SECTION LXVII.,"smit with the impetus of the peak, Kumbhakarna had his chargers and his"
6587,SECTION LXVII.,charioteers slain; and the terrific field overflowed with the blood of
6588,SECTION LXVII.,Rakshas. And Rākshasa car-warriors by means of arrows resembling the
6589,SECTION LXVII.,"Destroyer himself, cut off the heads of the foremost monkeys who had"
6590,SECTION LXVII.,"been setting up roars. And the high-souled monkeys also, uprooting"
6591,SECTION LXVII.,"giants trees, destroyed cars and horses and elephants and camels and"
6592,SECTION LXVII.,"Rākshasas.—And remaining in the sky, Hanumān discharged at Kumbhakarna’s"
6593,SECTION LXVII.,head mountain-peaks and rocks and various trees. And all those
6594,SECTION LXVII.,mountain-tops he cut off with his dart; and the mighty Kumbhakarna also
6595,SECTION LXVII.,"baffled the shower of trees.—Then grasping his sharpened spear,"
6596,SECTION LXVII.,Kumbhakarna darted against that terrific array of monkeys. And as he
6597,SECTION LXVII.,"charged them, Hanumān armed with a mountain-peak, stood before him. And"
6598,SECTION LXVII.,waxing enraged (Hanumān) vehemently smote Kumbhakarna with a gigantic
6599,SECTION LXVII.,"crag. And overpowered by that, Kumbhakarna experienced great torments,"
6600,SECTION LXVII.,and his body was covered with fat and blood. And then as Guha had
6601,SECTION LXVII.,"pierced Krauncha with his fierce dart, Kumbhakarna the mountain-like"
6602,SECTION LXVII.,smote the Wind-god’s son in the chest with his dart resembling lightning
6603,SECTION LXVII.,or like a glowing mountain-summit. And having his mighty chest pierced
6604,SECTION LXVII.,"in the mighty encounter, Hanumān, overwhelmed, and vomitting"
6605,SECTION LXVII.,"blood,—transported with wrath, set up roars resembling the roaring of"
6606,SECTION LXVII.,"the clouds at the universal disruption. And then, beholding him in"
6607,SECTION LXVII.,"torments, the Rakshas suddenly rejoiced, emitted shouts; and the monkeys"
6608,SECTION LXVII.,"aggrieved and overcome with fright, began to fly Kumbhakarna in battle."
6609,SECTION LXVII.,"And then the powerful Nila, arranging his forces, discharged a"
6610,SECTION LXVII.,"mountain-peak at the intelligent Kumbhakarna. And seeing it descend, he"
6611,SECTION LXVII.,"dealt it a blow; and struck by the blow, the mountain-top was shattered"
6612,SECTION LXVII.,in pieces; and dropped to the earth glowing and shooting living flames.
6613,SECTION LXVII.,And then Rishabha and Sarabha and Nila and Gavāksha and
6614,SECTION LXVII.,Gandhamādana—these five terrific monkeys—rushed against Kumbhakarna. And
6615,SECTION LXVII.,in the encounter those mighty monkeys began to sorely assail the
6616,SECTION LXVII.,huge-bodied Kumbhakarna with crags and trees and slaps and kicks and
6617,SECTION LXVII.,blows. But those blows seemed to him like touches²²⁴ and did not at all
6618,SECTION LXVII.,pain him. Then he fastened the vehement Rishabha with his arms. And
6619,SECTION LXVII.,"agonised on being fastened with Kumbhakarna’s arms, that foremost of"
6620,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys, the dreadful Rishabha, fell down to the earth, vomitting blood"
6621,SECTION LXVII.,"by his mouth. And then the enemy of Indra smit, Sarabha with blow, and"
6622,SECTION LXVII.,"Nila, in the conflict with his thigh, struck a slap at Gavāksha. And"
6623,SECTION LXVII.,suffering great pain in consequence of the blows (dealt by Kumbhakarna
6624,SECTION LXVII.,"those monkeys), deprived of their senses and bathed in blood, dropped"
6625,SECTION LXVII.,down to the earth like Kinçukas that have been cut down. And on those
6626,SECTION LXVII.,"high-souled and mighty monkeys falling down, thousands of monkeys rushed"
6627,SECTION LXVII.,"at Kumbhakarna. And ascending a mountain-summit, those foremost of"
6628,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys,²²⁵ possessed of the splendour of a mountain-peak, sprang upon"
6629,SECTION LXVII.,him and tore him with their teeth. And those foremost of monkeys
6630,SECTION LXVII.,attacked the long-armed Kumbhakarna with their claws and teeth and blows
6631,SECTION LXVII.,and arms. And then with thousands of monkeys on him that extraordinary
6632,SECTION LXVII.,"one that fearful Rākshasa—resembling a hill,—looked like a mountain with"
6633,SECTION LXVII.,"trees on it. And like Gāruda eating up serpents, that wondrous strong"
6634,SECTION LXVII.,"one, wrought up with rage, devoured those monkeys, seizing them with his"
6635,SECTION LXVII.,arms. And cast by Kumbhakarna into his mouth resembling the nether
6636,SECTION LXVII.,regions the monkeys emerged from his nose and ears. And eating up the
6637,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys, that foremost of Rākshasas resembling a hill, growing wroth,"
6638,SECTION LXVII.,"and fired with rage,²²⁶ began to break the monkeys down.—And transported"
6639,SECTION LXVII.,"with passion, that Rākshasa, making the earth miry with flesh and blood,"
6640,SECTION LXVII.,spread among the monkey-ranks like unto the fire at the a time of the
6641,SECTION LXVII.,"Universal dissolution. And in that encounter, Kumbhakarna armed with his"
6642,SECTION LXVII.,"dart in his hand, resembled the thunder-handed Sakra, or the"
6643,SECTION LXVII.,noose-handed Destroyer himself. And as a conflagration²²⁷ burneth up a
6644,SECTION LXVII.,"withered forest in the summer, Kumbhakarna burnt that host of the"
6645,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys. And thus beaten (by Kumbhakarna), those monkeys, with their"
6646,SECTION LXVII.,"ranks destroyed, the monkeys,²²⁸ racked with anxiety, began to cry in"
6647,SECTION LXVII.,"unnatural tones. And having innumerable monkeys slain by Kumbhakarna,"
6648,SECTION LXVII.,"the monkeys, aggrieved and their hearts riven with sorrow, sought the"
6649,SECTION LXVII.,"shelter of Rāghava. Seeing the monkeys broken in the terrific encounter,"
6650,SECTION LXVII.,"the son of the thunder-handed,²²⁹ darted impetuously against"
6651,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna. And taking up a mighty crag, he momentarily setting up"
6652,SECTION LXVII.,"roars, and thereby terrorizing all the Rākshasas—followers of"
6653,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna, he discharged the mountain-peak right against Kumbhakarna’s"
6654,SECTION LXVII.,"crown.—And struck with that mountain-peak, Indra’s"
6655,SECTION LXVII.,enemy—Kumbhakarna—flamed up in fierce wrath. And the loud-throated
6656,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna, terrifying all the monkeys vehemently darted against the"
6657,SECTION LXVII.,enraged son of Vāli; and then that wondrous strong one hurled his dart
6658,SECTION LXVII.,"at Angada. And as the dart descended, that foremost of monkeys endowed"
6659,SECTION LXVII.,"with strength,²³⁰ and skilled in battle, evaded the weapon from his"
6660,SECTION LXVII.,"fleetness. And then swiftly springing up, he slapped (his antagonist) in"
6661,SECTION LXVII.,"the chest. And thereat that one resembling a hill, lost his senses. And"
6662,SECTION LXVII.,"recovering his senses, that exceedingly strong Rākshasa, dealt a blow at"
6663,SECTION LXVII.,Angada; and the latter dropped down senseless. And on that powerful
6664,SECTION LXVII.,"monkey falling down insensible, Kumbhakarna, taking his dart, rushed"
6665,SECTION LXVII.,"against Sugriva. And seeing the exceeding stout Kumbhakarna approach,"
6666,SECTION LXVII.,the heroic king of monkeys—Sugriva—sprang up; and taking a mountain-top
6667,SECTION LXVII.,that one possessed of great strength darted against the mighty
6668,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna. And seeing that monkey, Kumbhakarna, stretching his limbs,"
6669,SECTION LXVII.,"stood before the lord of monkeys. And seeing Kumbhakarna, with his body"
6670,SECTION LXVII.,"laved in the blood of monkeys; and eating up mighty monkeys, Sugriva"
6671,SECTION LXVII.,"addressed him, saying,—""Thou hast felled heroes done deeds difficult of"
6672,SECTION LXVII.,"being performed, and hast devoured the warriors; and thou hast thus"
6673,SECTION LXVII.,attained renown. But let go now the monkey-army. What shalt thou do with
6674,SECTION LXVII.,"the ignoble? Do thou, O Rākshasa bear the descent of this mountain""."
6675,SECTION LXVII.,Hearing those words of the monkey-king instinct with strength and
6676,SECTION LXVII.,"fortitude, that terrible Rākshasa—Kumbhakarna—said,—""O monkey, thou"
6677,SECTION LXVII.,"stormest, because thou art the grandson of Prajāpati²³¹ and the son of"
6678,SECTION LXVII.,the king of bears; and because as such thou art endowed with fortitude
6679,SECTION LXVII.,"and prowess"". Hearing Kumbhakarna’s speech, Sugriva whirling that"
6680,SECTION LXVII.,"mountain-peak, suddenly let it go; and with that rock resembling _Vajra_"
6681,SECTION LXVII.,"or the thunder-bolt, smote Kumbhakarna in the chest. And on coming in"
6682,SECTION LXVII.,"contact with his wide breast, that mountain-peak was at once shattered"
6683,SECTION LXVII.,in shivers. And thereat the monkeys grew dispirited and the Rākshasa’s
6684,SECTION LXVII.,"ranks shouted in joy. And struck with the mountain-summit, Kumbhakarna"
6685,SECTION LXVII.,"was fired with wrath; and roared, expending his face. And then, whirling"
6686,SECTION LXVII.,"his dart resembling lightning displayed, he hurled it for compassing the"
6687,SECTION LXVII.,"destruction of the master of monkeys. Then swiftly bounding up, the"
6688,SECTION LXVII.,"Wind-god’s son, resisting that whetted dart fastened with golden"
6689,SECTION LXVII.,"chains,—with his hands violently snapped it in twain. And placing the"
6690,SECTION LXVII.,"same on his thighs, (Hanumān) snapped that ponderous and terrible dart"
6691,SECTION LXVII.,"composed of black iron, and thereat the monkeys waxed delighted. And"
6692,SECTION LXVII.,"seeing the dart severed by Hanumān, the monkey-army, growing delighted,"
6693,SECTION LXVII.,set up countless shouts and rushed in all directions. And the Rākshasa
6694,SECTION LXVII.,was seized with fear and turned away (from the field.) And the monkeys
6695,SECTION LXVII.,"excessively delighted, set up loud shouts, and finding the dart broken,"
6696,SECTION LXVII.,poured forth thanks to the Wind-god’s son. Then the mighty-minded lord
6697,SECTION LXVII.,"of Rākshasas seeing the dart thus severed, uprooted a peak from the"
6698,SECTION LXVII.,Malaya and with it smote Sugriva. The king of monkeys struck with the
6699,SECTION LXVII.,"mountain-peak fell senseless upon the field, and the demons finding him"
6700,SECTION LXVII.,in this plight shouted out in great joy. Then Kumbhakarna coming to the
6701,SECTION LXVII.,"wonderfully mighty master of monkeys, took him up and stole away from"
6702,SECTION LXVII.,"the field, as a violent gust of wind stealeth away a patch of cloud."
6703,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain in loftiness of stature, while"
6704,SECTION LXVII.,taking him away like a mass of cloud appeared like Sumeru overtopped
6705,SECTION LXVII.,with lofty peaks. Thus the lord of Rākshasas went on hearing thanks
6706,SECTION LXVII.,"(from the Rākshasas) and shouts from the lords of the heavens, wondered"
6707,SECTION LXVII.,"at the capture of the foremost of monkeys. Thus taking him captive, that"
6708,SECTION LXVII.,"mighty one resembling Indra in puissance, thought his death would"
6709,SECTION LXVII.,destroy the entire host of the opponents together with Rāghava. Then
6710,SECTION LXVII.,"Hanumān, the shrewd son of Maruta, finding the whole host of monkeys"
6711,SECTION LXVII.,"scattered in all directions, as well as Sugriva captured by Kumbhakarna"
6712,SECTION LXVII.,"bethought himself—""What ought to be done by me now that our king has"
6713,SECTION LXVII.,been captured? I will doubtless do as befits me now—let me assume the
6714,SECTION LXVII.,shape of a mountain and kill the Rākshasas. Let me kill the mighty
6715,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna, splitting his body with my strong fist and thus relieve the"
6716,SECTION LXVII.,master of monkeys—thus let the whole host of monkeys become delighted.
6717,SECTION LXVII.,"Or, even when captured by the whole host of gods or Asuras or serpents"
6718,SECTION LXVII.,"he is mighty enough to extricate himself. Meseems, the lord of monkeys"
6719,SECTION LXVII.,struck with dart in battle by Kumbhakarna has not yet recovered his
6720,SECTION LXVII.,senses. Else in a moment he would do the needful for himself as well as
6721,SECTION LXVII.,the monkeys. Should the relief of the mighty-minded Sugriva come from
6722,SECTION LXVII.,"me, I should be incurring his displeasure and it would certainly lead to"
6723,SECTION LXVII.,the loss of his reputation for ever; then I must wait a moment and see
6724,SECTION LXVII.,his own might displayed by himself when relieved. Meanwhile let me cheer
6725,SECTION LXVII.,"up the monkey-host"". Thinking thus within himself, Hanumān, that son of"
6726,SECTION LXVII.,"Maruta, began to stay the mighty host of monkeys. In the meantime"
6727,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna entered Lankā with Sugrira trembling, being honored with the"
6728,SECTION LXVII.,"showering of beautiful flowers from the sky, the buildings on the main"
6729,SECTION LXVII.,roads and the town-gate. Then the mighty one (Sugriva) slowly recovered
6730,SECTION LXVII.,his senses with the shower of fried paddy and sweet scent and the
6731,SECTION LXVII.,sprinkling of water as well as with the coolness of the streets. Then
6732,SECTION LXVII.,"that mighty-minded (Sugriva), caught in the arms of the powerful"
6733,SECTION LXVII.,"Rākshasa, having with difficulty come to his senses and surveying around"
6734,SECTION LXVII.,"him the streets of the town bethought himself:—""When thus within the"
6735,SECTION LXVII.,grasp of the enemy how can I take revenge? Or let me do what will be
6736,SECTION LXVII.,"acceptable and advantageous to our army"". Then advancing all on a"
6737,SECTION LXVII.,"sudden, he with his nails and sharp teeth cut off the ears and nose of"
6738,SECTION LXVII.,that lord of the enemies of the gods and split both his sides with the
6739,SECTION LXVII.,blow of his feet. And Kumbhakarna losing his ears and nose and having
6740,SECTION LXVII.,"his sides split with nails and teeth grew angry, and becoming all"
6741,SECTION LXVII.,"covered over with blood, threw Sugriva to the ground and pressed him."
6742,SECTION LXVII.,Thus pressed upon the ground with main force and severely struck by the
6743,SECTION LXVII.,"enemies of gods, he flew to the skies like a ball-rolling, and once more"
6744,SECTION LXVII.,joined Rāma. The mighty Kumbhakarna having lost his nose and ears and
6745,SECTION LXVII.,"drenched in blood, appeared like a mountain covered all over with"
6746,SECTION LXVII.,"streamlets. That huge-bodied Rākshasa, younger brother of Rāvana,"
6747,SECTION LXVII.,"terrible in appearance, resembling a mass of deep black collyrium, and"
6748,SECTION LXVII.,"covered all over with blood, appeared like an evening cloud; and (once"
6749,SECTION LXVII.,"more) made up his mind to appear in battle. Sugriva having thus escaped,"
6750,SECTION LXVII.,that dreadful enemy of the king of the celestials in wrath again rushed
6751,SECTION LXVII.,to battle; and finding himself destitute of arms took up a fearful mace.
6752,SECTION LXVII.,"And then that mighty-minded one, the Raksha Kumbhakarna, issuing out of"
6753,SECTION LXVII.,"the city began to devour the terrific host of monkeys, as doth the"
6754,SECTION LXVII.,mighty fire eat up people at the end of a Yuga. On entering the mighty
6755,SECTION LXVII.,"host of monkeys, the hungry Kumbhakarna, hankering after flesh and"
6756,SECTION LXVII.,"blood, ate up the monkeys, and with them, devoured many a Rākshasa and"
6757,SECTION LXVII.,"Pisācha by mistake. Thus, as Death devoureth creatures at the end of a"
6758,SECTION LXVII.,"Yuga, he destroyed the mighty monkeys. And he in wrath, taking up with"
6759,SECTION LXVII.,"one hand the monkeys along with the Rākshasas, hurriedly threw them into"
6760,SECTION LXVII.,"his mouth,—one, two three, or many at a time. And blood and fat flowed"
6761,SECTION LXVII.,copiously down his body; and though struck by the monkeys with peaks of
6762,SECTION LXVII.,"mountains, the mighty one devoured all those monkeys. And the monkeys as"
6763,SECTION LXVII.,"they were being devoured, saught the shelter of Rāma. And Kumbhakarna"
6764,SECTION LXVII.,"wrought up with wrath, chased amain hundreds of monkeys, eating up"
6765,SECTION LXVII.,"seven, eight, twenty, or thirty. And fastening (the monkeys) with his"
6766,SECTION LXVII.,"arms, he, devouring them, rushed on. And resembling the Destroyer of"
6767,SECTION LXVII.,"prodigious dimensions at the end of a Yuga, that one furnished with"
6768,SECTION LXVII.,"extremely sharp teeth, having his body covered with fat, marrow and"
6769,SECTION LXVII.,"blood, and coiling entrails about his ears, began to discharge darts."
6770,SECTION LXVII.,"And at this moment, that subduer of hostile hosts and captor of the"
6771,SECTION LXVII.,"capitals of foes—Sumitrā’s son—Lakshmana, growing enraged, entered on an"
6772,SECTION LXVII.,encounter with the enemy. And Lakshmana endued with prowess shot seven
6773,SECTION LXVII.,"shafts at Kumbhakarna’s body; and next, taking up other arrows also"
6774,SECTION LXVII.,"discharged them (at his antagonist). And thereat that Rākshasa, smarting"
6775,SECTION LXVII.,"under the wounds inflicted by that weapon,²³² cut it off (by means of a"
6776,SECTION LXVII.,weapon). Thereupon grew enraged the powerful Lakshmana—enhancer of
6777,SECTION LXVII.,"Sumitrā’s joy. And then as the wind overspreadeth evening clouds, he"
6778,SECTION LXVII.,with his shafts covered his²³³ shining and graceful mail entirely made
6779,SECTION LXVII.,"of gold. And smit with arrows dight with gold, that one resembling a"
6780,SECTION LXVII.,mass of dark-blue collyrium appeared beautiful like the ray-furnished
6781,SECTION LXVII.,Sun surrounded by clouds. Then that dreadful Rākshasa voiced like masses
6782,SECTION LXVII.,"of clouds, scornfully addressed the enhancer of Sumitrā’s felicity,"
6783,SECTION LXVII.,"saying,—""By dauntlessly fighting with me, who have without ado brought"
6784,SECTION LXVII.,"down the Destroyer himself in battle, thou hast established thy heroism."
6785,SECTION LXVII.,"Even by staying before me, who am equipped with arms in this encounter,"
6786,SECTION LXVII.,"and who in mighty conflict resemble Death himself, thou deservest to be"
6787,SECTION LXVII.,honored. What shall I say of thy fighting? Not even that lord—Sakra
6788,SECTION LXVII.,"himself—mounted on his Airāvata, and engirt by all the immortals,—had"
6789,SECTION LXVII.,"ever before stayed before me in the field. But to-day, O Sumitrā’s son,"
6790,SECTION LXVII.,"albeit a boy, thou hast gratified me with thy prowess. Now taking thy"
6791,SECTION LXVII.,"leave, I wish to go to Rāghava. And as I have been well pleased in"
6792,SECTION LXVII.,"battle with thy vigour and strength and enthusiasm, I now wish to slay"
6793,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāma alone, who being slain, all are slain. On Rāma being here slain by"
6794,SECTION LXVII.,"me, the rest remaining in the encounter—them shall I undertake with my"
6795,SECTION LXVII.,"all-crushing vigour"". When that Raksha had spoken thus, (Lakshmana);"
6796,SECTION LXVII.,"Sumitrā’s son, present in that contest, answered him laughing in"
6797,SECTION LXVII.,"terrible words, saying,—""That thy prowess is incapable of being borne by"
6798,SECTION LXVII.,"Sakra and other celestials,—is true. It is not otherwise, O hero. To-day"
6799,SECTION LXVII.,I myself have witnessed thy prowess. Yonder is Daçaratha’s
6800,SECTION LXVII.,"son—Rāma—staying like a moveless mountain"". Hearing this, that"
6801,SECTION LXVII.,"night-ranger—Kumhhakarna—possessed of immense might, disregarding"
6802,SECTION LXVII.,"Lakshmana and passing beyond Sumitrā’s son, rushed against Rāma, making"
6803,SECTION LXVII.,"the earth tremble. Thereat Daçaratha’s son, Rāma, employing a terrific"
6804,SECTION LXVII.,"weapon, discharged sharpened shafts at Kumbhakarna’s breast. Thereat"
6805,SECTION LXVII.,flames mixed with live embers shot out from the mouth of that enraged
6806,SECTION LXVII.,"one suddenly rushing (against Rāma),—as Rāma pierced him (with his"
6807,SECTION LXVII.,"arrows). And on being frightfully pierced by Rāma’s weapons, that"
6808,SECTION LXVII.,"foremost of Rākshasas, roaring wrathfully darted against Rāma, and"
6809,SECTION LXVII.,pursued the monkeys in the conflict. And those shafts adorned with
6810,SECTION LXVII.,"peacock’s plumes, alighting on (Kumbhakarna’s) chest, his mace, escaping"
6811,SECTION LXVII.,"his hand, dropped to the earth; and all his (other) arms also were"
6812,SECTION LXVII.,scattered on the ground. And when that exceedingly powerful one saw
6813,SECTION LXVII.,"himself deprived of all his arms, he began to spread a huge havoc by"
6814,SECTION LXVII.,means of his clenched fists and hands. And with his body entirely
6815,SECTION LXVII.,"covered with arrows and bathed in blood, he began to bleed like a hill"
6816,SECTION LXVII.,overflowing with fountains. And fired with wrath and maddened with
6817,SECTION LXVII.,"blood,²³⁴ he rusheth on, devouring monkeys and Rākshasas and bears. And"
6818,SECTION LXVII.,"that redoubtable one possessed of dreadful prowess, resembling the"
6819,SECTION LXVII.,"Reaper himself, whirling a mighty mountain-peak, hurled it aiming at"
6820,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāma. Thereat Bharata’s elder brother, the righteous Rāma, ere that"
6821,SECTION LXVII.,"prodigious peak had alighted, severed the same by means of seven"
6822,SECTION LXVII.,straight-speeding shafts wrought with gold. Intent on finishing
6823,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna, the virtuous Lakshmana, revolving many a means, (at last)"
6824,SECTION LXVII.,"spoke unto Rāma,—""O king, this one knoweth not monkeys and"
6825,SECTION LXVII.,"Rākshasas,—maddened with the smell of blood, he eateth up his own as"
6826,SECTION LXVII.,"well as his enemies. Now let the foremost monkeys, putting forth their"
6827,SECTION LXVII.,"best, mount on him; and let the leaders of bands according to their"
6828,SECTION LXVII.,"rank, stand surrounding him. And then to-day this wicked-minded"
6829,SECTION LXVII.,"Rākshasa, oppressed with a mighty weight, will no longer be able to eat"
6830,SECTION LXVII.,"up any more monkeys"". Hearing the words of the intelligent prince, those"
6831,SECTION LXVII.,exceedingly powerful monkeys with alacrity ascended Kumbhakarna. And
6832,SECTION LXVII.,"Kumbhakarna mounted by those monkeys, waxing exceedingly enraged, shook"
6833,SECTION LXVII.,"them vehemently, even as mad elephants shake the drivers thereof. And"
6834,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāghava seeing them shaken, and concluding the Rākshasa to be wroth,"
6835,SECTION LXVII.,"furiously sprang forward, taking his bow. And with his eyes crimsoned"
6836,SECTION LXVII.,"with choler, the gentle Rāghava, as if burning up the Rākshasa with his"
6837,SECTION LXVII.,"eyes, rushed forth vehemently, summoning up all his impetuosity, thereby"
6838,SECTION LXVII.,cheering up the leaders of bands that had been sore tried by the might
6839,SECTION LXVII.,"of Kumbhakarna. And equipped with an excellent quiver and arrows, Rāma"
6840,SECTION LXVII.,"cheering up the monkeys sprang forward, taking a bow, resembling a"
6841,SECTION LXVII.,serpent; terrific; having a stout string; and embellished in gold. Then
6842,SECTION LXVII.,"surrounded by exceedingly invincible monkey-bands, that highly powerful"
6843,SECTION LXVII.,"hero, followed by Lakshmana, marched forth. And he saw the redoubtable"
6844,SECTION LXVII.,"and high-souled Kumbhakarna, with his body drenched in blood, and with"
6845,SECTION LXVII.,"blood-shot eyes; rushing against all, like unto an infuriated elephant"
6846,SECTION LXVII.,of the cardinal points; pursuing the monkeys; wrought up with wrath;
6847,SECTION LXVII.,environed by Rākshasas; appearing like the Vindhya or the Mandara;
6848,SECTION LXVII.,decked with golden _angadas_; bleeding from his mouth; like clouds
6849,SECTION LXVII.,pouring showers; licking at the corners of his mouth laved with blood;
6850,SECTION LXVII.,smashing the monkey-ranks; and resembling Yama the Destroyer. And that
6851,SECTION LXVII.,"best of persons, seeing that foremost of Rākshasas having the splendour"
6852,SECTION LXVII.,"of a living fire, stretched his bow to its full bent. And fired with"
6853,SECTION LXVII.,"wrath at the twang of his bow, that foremost of Rākshasas, inflamed with"
6854,SECTION LXVII.,"wrath,—not brooking that report, rushed against Rāghava. Thereat, the"
6855,SECTION LXVII.,"gentle Rāma, endowed with arms resembling the body of the sovereign of"
6856,SECTION LXVII.,"serpents, in that encounter addressed Kumbhakarna, like unto an elevated"
6857,SECTION LXVII.,"cloud and possessed of the splendour of a mountain,—as he darted"
6858,SECTION LXVII.,"forward, saying,—""Come, O king of Rakshas! Let no grief be thine! Here I"
6859,SECTION LXVII.,"stay, taking my bow in my hand. Know me for the destroyer of the race of"
6860,SECTION LXVII.,"the Rākshasas—thou who in a moment shalt be deprived of thy senses""."
6861,SECTION LXVII.,"Knowing that this was Rāma, (Kumbhakarna) laughed in frightful accents;"
6862,SECTION LXVII.,"and then, wrought up with wrath, rushed against the monkeys in the"
6863,SECTION LXVII.,"encounter. And as if riving the breasts of all the monkeys (present),"
6864,SECTION LXVII.,"the exceedingly energetic Kumbhakarna, laughing frightfully and in a"
6865,SECTION LXVII.,"terrific manner,—resembling the rumbling of clouds, addressed Rāghava,"
6866,SECTION LXVII.,"saying,—""Take me not for Virādha, or for Kavandha, or yet for Khara. I"
6867,SECTION LXVII.,"am not Vāli or Māricha. I am Kumbhakarna, that am come. Behold my"
6868,SECTION LXVII.,dreadful and mighty mace entirely made of iron. By help of this I had
6869,SECTION LXVII.,formerly brought down deities and Dānavas. It doth not behove thee to
6870,SECTION LXVII.,scorn me in that my nose hath been severed. I do not feel any the
6871,SECTION LXVII.,smallest torment in consequence of my ears and nose having been cut off.
6872,SECTION LXVII.,"O tiger of the Ikshwaku line, O sinless one, do thou witness the prowess"
6873,SECTION LXVII.,"that is in my frame. And thereafter, when thou shalt have displayed thy"
6874,SECTION LXVII.,"prowess and power, shall I devour thee up"". Hearing Kumbhakarna’s words,"
6875,SECTION LXVII.,Rāma discharged (at him) shafts furnished with knobs. And smit with
6876,SECTION LXVII.,"these having the impetus of the thunder-bolt, the foe of the celestials"
6877,SECTION LXVII.,did not feel any pain or smart. And those shafts which had severed the
6878,SECTION LXVII.,"seven stately _sālas_, and, to boot, had slain Vāli—best of"
6879,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys,—they resembling the thunder itself—could not impart any pain to"
6880,SECTION LXVII.,Kumbhakarna’s body. And drinking up in his body those arrows resembling
6881,SECTION LXVII.,"a shower, the enemy of the great Indra whirling his mace possessed of"
6882,SECTION LXVII.,"fierce vehemence, put out the arrowy discharge of Rāma. Then that Raksha"
6883,SECTION LXVII.,"whirling his mace washed in blood, capable of striking terror into the"
6884,SECTION LXVII.,"mighty hosts of gods and Dānavas, and possessed of fierce impetus,—made"
6885,SECTION LXVII.,"the monkey-army take to its heels. Then Rāma, taking a mighty _Vāyavya_"
6886,SECTION LXVII.,"weapon, used the same against the night-ranger; and cut off his arm with"
6887,SECTION LXVII.,"the mace. And having his arm cut off, he set up tremendous roars. And"
6888,SECTION LXVII.,"his arm with the mace, resembling a mountain-peak, cut off by Rāghava’s"
6889,SECTION LXVII.,"arrows, fell in the midst of the army of the monkey-king, and destroyed"
6890,SECTION LXVII.,that army.²³⁵ Thereat the monkeys remaining after those broken and
6891,SECTION LXVII.,"slain,—dispirited, and having their limbs wounded,—moving aside, looked"
6892,SECTION LXVII.,on the dreadful encounter between the Raksha and the lord of men. And
6893,SECTION LXVII.,"then Kumbhakarna, having his arm severed, resembling the foremost of"
6894,SECTION LXVII.,"mountains with its crest hewn away by a mighty sabre, tore up a tree"
6895,SECTION LXVII.,with his (remaining) arm and in the conflict rushed against the monarch
6896,SECTION LXVII.,"of men. Thereupon with a shaft plated in gold, set upon a weapon of"
6897,SECTION LXVII.,"Indra, Rāma cut off his uplifted arm with a palm tree, looking like the"
6898,SECTION LXVII.,"body of a _pannaga_. And that arm of Kumbhakarna, being severed, dropped"
6899,SECTION LXVII.,"inert on the earth, like a hill, and crushed trees and rocks and crags"
6900,SECTION LXVII.,"and monkeys and Rākshasas. And Rāma, seeing that one shorn of his arms"
6901,SECTION LXVII.,"suddenly spring up, roaring,—took up two whetted crescents, and in the"
6902,SECTION LXVII.,contest cut off the legs of the Rākshasa. And thereupon those legs (of
6903,SECTION LXVII.,"his), making all sides and quarters and rocks and caves and the mighty"
6904,SECTION LXVII.,main and Lankā herself and the army of the monkeys and the
6905,SECTION LXVII.,"Rākshasas,—resound,—dropped down (on the ground). And having his arms"
6906,SECTION LXVII.,"cut off and his legs also severed, (Kumbhakarna), opening wide his mouth"
6907,SECTION LXVII.,"resembling in sheen the mouth of a mare, roaring swiftly darted against"
6908,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāghava,—even as Rāhu pursueth the Moon in the firmament. Then Rāma"
6909,SECTION LXVII.,stuffed his mouth full of sharpened shafts having their feathered parts
6910,SECTION LXVII.,furnished with gold. And having his mouth filled; he could not
6911,SECTION LXVII.,articulate; but with extreme effort uttered indistinct accents and
6912,SECTION LXVII.,"swooned away. Then Rāma took an arrow of Indra,—whetted and knobbed,"
6913,SECTION LXVII.,"impetuous as the wind, resembling the effulgence of the Sun, and like"
6914,SECTION LXVII.,"unto the very banner of Brahmā, or the Destroyer himself; and fatal to"
6915,SECTION LXVII.,foes. And then Rāma hurled it at the ranger of the night. And thereat
6916,SECTION LXVII.,"that weapon hurled by Rāma’s arm, resembling a smokeless flame, lighting"
6917,SECTION LXVII.,"up the ten cardinal points with its own glory,—saught him that was"
6918,SECTION LXVII.,possessed of the dreadful energy of Sakra’s thunder-bolt. And therewith
6919,SECTION LXVII.,he (Rāma) cut off the head of the lord of Rakshas resembling a
6920,SECTION LXVII.,"mountain-summit, furnished with prominent teeth,—from which the"
6921,SECTION LXVII.,"ear-rings had fallen off,—even as formerly Purandara had cut off the"
6922,SECTION LXVII.,head of Vritra. And then Kumbhakarna’s huge head deprived of the
6923,SECTION LXVII.,ear-rings appeared like the Moon seated in the midst (of the heavens) on
6924,SECTION LXVII.,"the rising of the Sun in the morning.²³⁶ And struck with Rāma’s arrow,"
6925,SECTION LXVII.,the head of the Raksha resembling a hill fell down to the earth; and (in
6926,SECTION LXVII.,its fall) crushed edifices on the highways and gateways; and elevated
6927,SECTION LXVII.,walls also it bore down to the ground. And then that Raksha of gigantic
6928,SECTION LXVII.,proportions and vast to the view plunged into the deep; and crushing
6929,SECTION LXVII.,"huge and mighty fishes and serpents, saught the depths. And on that"
6930,SECTION LXVII.,"enemy of the Brahmanas and gods, endowed with immense strength,—having"
6931,SECTION LXVII.,"been slain in battle, the earth shook and the mountains also; and from"
6932,SECTION LXVII.,excess of joy the celestials shouted aloud. And those deities and saints
6933,SECTION LXVII.,"and Maharshis and Pannagas, and celestials and (other) beings and birds"
6934,SECTION LXVII.,"and Guhyakas, together with Yakshas and Gandharvas,—all these who had"
6935,SECTION LXVII.,"stationed themselves in the welkin,—were rejoiced at the prowess of"
6936,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāma. And at his (Kumbhakarna’s) great destruction, the intelligent"
6937,SECTION LXVII.,"adherents of the king of Nairitas,—aggrieved exceedingly, began to cry"
6938,SECTION LXVII.,"at the sight of that best of the Raghus, even as mad elephants cry at"
6939,SECTION LXVII.,"sight of a lion. And like unto the Sun emerged from the mouth of Rāhu,"
6940,SECTION LXVII.,"and destroying the darkness of the celestial fields,—shone Rāma in the"
6941,SECTION LXVII.,midst of the monkey-army having slain Kumbhakarna in battle. And
6942,SECTION LXVII.,countless monkeys experienced the very height of delight; and on (their)
6943,SECTION LXVII.,"foe of terrific strength having been slain, they with countenances"
6944,SECTION LXVII.,resembling awaked lotuses paid homage unto the king’s son—Rāghava—the
6945,SECTION LXVII.,sharer of good fortune. And as the monarch of the immortals had rejoiced
6946,SECTION LXVII.,on slaying the mighty Asura—Vritra—Bharata’s elder brother rejoiced on
6947,SECTION LXVII.,"having in battle slain that smiter of celestial hosts, Kumbhakarna in"
6948,SECTION LXVII.,"mighty conflict, never (before) vanquished in renowned encounters."

6991,SECTION LXVIII.,"for a while displayed his prowess, hath met with his quietus at the"

6998,SECTION LXVIII.,"burning in grief, swooned away and dropped to the earth. And hearing"
6999,SECTION LXVIII.,"their uncle slain, Triçiras²³⁷ and Atikāya—destroyers of gods and"
7000,SECTION LXVIII.,"men,—began to weep, oppressed with sorrow. And Mahodara²³⁸ and"
7001,SECTION LXVIII.,"Mahāpārçwa²³⁹ hearing of their uncle slain by Rāma of untiring deeds,"
7002,SECTION LXVIII.,were overcome with grief. Then regaining his senses with extreme
7003,SECTION LXVIII.,"exertion, that foremost of Rākshasas, distressed in consequence of the"
7004,SECTION LXVIII.,"destruction of Kumbhakarna, mourned with his senses overwhelmed,"
7005,SECTION LXVIII.,"saying,—""O hero! O humbler of the pride of the foe! O mighty"
7006,SECTION LXVIII.,"Kumbhakarna! Leaving me, thou through Destiny, hast gone to the abode of"
7007,SECTION LXVIII.,"Yama. O exceedingly powerful one, leaving me (lone) whither dost thou"

7009,SECTION LXVIII.,"really I am not, inasmuch as my right arm hath dropped. Backed by this"

7012,SECTION LXVIII.,"Fire arisen at the hour of universal wreck,—been slain in fight by"

7015,SECTION LXVIII.,soundly on the earth? These gods stationed in the sky along with the

7051,SECTION LXIX.,certainly alone art competent to conquer the triple world. Wherefore
7052,SECTION LXIX.,then dost thou vent such sorrow like an ignoble one? Thou hast thy dart
7053,SECTION LXIX.,conferred on thee by Brahmā; and thy mail and thy weapon—the bow—and thy
7054,SECTION LXIX.,"car yoked with a thousand asses, sending forth clatter resembling the"
7055,SECTION LXIX.,rumbling of clouds. The deities and the Dānavas have by means of thy
7056,SECTION LXIX.,"arms been terrified over and over again. And furnished with all arms,"
7057,SECTION LXIX.,"thou ought to chastise Rāghava. But stay at thy pleasure, O mighty"
7058,SECTION LXIX.,"sovereign, I will go out to battle; and even as Gāruda captureth"
7059,SECTION LXIX.,"serpents, will I capture thine enemies. And as Samvara was vanquished by"
7060,SECTION LXIX.,"the lord of the immortals, or Naraka by Vishnu, will I bringing down"
7061,SECTION LXIX.,"Rāma in battle make him sleep (in the field)"". Hearing Triçiras’ words,"
7062,SECTION LXIX.,"Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—urged on by Fate, considered himself as having"
7063,SECTION LXIX.,"regained his life. And hearing the speech of Triçiras, Devāntaka, and"
7064,SECTION LXIX.,"Narāntaka, and the energetic Atikāya also, were wrought up with martial"
7065,SECTION LXIX.,enthusiasm. And then those foremost of Nairitas—the heroic sons of
7066,SECTION LXIX.,"Rāvana—endowed with the prowess of Sakra himself—roared out, ’I will"
7067,SECTION LXIX.,"go,’ ’I will go.’ And all could range the sky, and all were skilled in"
7068,SECTION LXIX.,"illusion, and all were crushers of the pride of the immortals; and all"
7069,SECTION LXIX.,were irrisistible in encounter. And all of them were endowed with
7070,SECTION LXIX.,"superior strength, and all had achieved wide celebrity. They had never"
7071,SECTION LXIX.,been heard of as having been beaten in fight even by the gods along with
7072,SECTION LXIX.,"the Gandharvas, or the mighty serpents accompanied by the Kinnaras. And"
7073,SECTION LXIX.,all were skilled in weapons and heroic; and all were versed in warfare.
7074,SECTION LXIX.,And all were possessed of the higher knowledge; and all had obtained
7075,SECTION LXIX.,"boons. And then the king surrounded by those sons of his, appearing like"
7076,SECTION LXIX.,"celestials,—capable of injuring the force and fortune of the foe,—looked"
7077,SECTION LXIX.,"splendid like Maghavān environed by the immortals, humblers of the"
7078,SECTION LXIX.,hauteur of mighty Dānavas. And embracing his sons and adorning them in
7079,SECTION LXIX.,"ornaments,—he sent them to the field with his best benedictions. And"
7080,SECTION LXIX.,Rāvana sent the brothers—Yudhyonmatta and Matta—for protecting the
7081,SECTION LXIX.,"princes in the field. And then, saluting the high-souled"
7082,SECTION LXIX.,"Rāvana—destroyer of creatures,—and going round him, those huge-bodied"
7083,SECTION LXIX.,ones marched forth. And furnished with every description of medicinal
7084,SECTION LXIX.,"herbs and perfumes, these six Nairitas—foremost of their kind—endowed"
7085,SECTION LXIX.,"with great strength—burning for battle, marched forth,—Triçiras and"
7086,SECTION LXIX.,"Atikāya, and Devāntaka and Narāntaka, and Mahodara and Mahāpārçwa went"
7087,SECTION LXIX.,"out, urged on by Fate. Then Mahodara mounted the"
7088,SECTION LXIX.,"elephant—Sudarçana—sprung in the race of Airāvata, and resembling"
7089,SECTION LXIX.,"dark-blue clouds. And accoutred in every weapon, and decked with"
7090,SECTION LXIX.,"quivers, he looked splendid on his elephant like the Sun ascending the"
7091,SECTION LXIX.,crest of the Setting-hill. And Rāvana’s son—Triçiras—ascended a car
7092,SECTION LXIX.,"yoked with excellent steeds, and furnished with every variety of arms."
7093,SECTION LXIX.,"And having ascended the car, Triçiras bow in hand appeared beautiful"
7094,SECTION LXIX.,"like a mass of burning clouds having lightning and meteors, and crowned"
7095,SECTION LXIX.,"with Indra’s bow.²⁴¹ And dight with three diadems, Triçiras looked"
7096,SECTION LXIX.,"splendid in that superb car, like the monarch of mountains Himavān—with"
7097,SECTION LXIX.,the three golden hills. And then that foremost of all bowmen—the
7098,SECTION LXIX.,powerful Atikāya—son unto the lord of Rākshasas—ascended the best of
7099,SECTION LXIX.,"cars having excellent wheels and _akshas_, and yoked with excellent"
7100,SECTION LXIX.,"steeds,—and furnished with bottoms and holes; flaming with quivers and"
7101,SECTION LXIX.,bows; and bristling with _prāças_ and swords and blugdeons. And adorned
7102,SECTION LXIX.,"with a crown plated with wrought gold and (other) ornaments, he looked"
7103,SECTION LXIX.,like the Meru swimming in its own splendour And that powerful son of the
7104,SECTION LXIX.,king surrounded by the Nairitas looked lovely on that car like the
7105,SECTION LXIX.,thunder-handed (Deity) engirt by the immortals. And Narāntaka mounted a
7106,SECTION LXIX.,"white steed resembling Uchchaiçrava, caparisoned in gold, having a large"
7107,SECTION LXIX.,"frame and endowed with the velocity of the Wind. And taking a _prāça_,"
7108,SECTION LXIX.,"Narantaka appeared like the energetic Guha mounted on the peacock,"
7109,SECTION LXIX.,"grasping his dart. And taking a bludgeon decked in golden ornaments,"
7110,SECTION LXIX.,"Devāntaka resembled Vishnu at the time of the churning of the ocean,"
7111,SECTION LXIX.,"holding the Darbhyā,²⁴² and staying burthening (the earth). And the"
7112,SECTION LXIX.,"powerful Mahāpārçwa endowed with terrific energy, taking his mace,"
7113,SECTION LXIX.,appeared like Kuvera holding in his hand a mace in the encounter. And
7114,SECTION LXIX.,"like immortals issuing out of Amarāvati, they marched out with elephants"
7115,SECTION LXIX.,and steeds and cars sending out clatter resembling the rumbling of
7116,SECTION LXIX.,clouds. And them followed high-souled Rākshasas equipped with
7117,SECTION LXIX.,mighty-arms. And those sun-bright high-souled princes decked with
7118,SECTION LXIX.,diadems appeared splendid like burning planets in the firmament. And the
7119,SECTION LXIX.,various gorgeous attires which they had worn resembled rows of cranes in
7120,SECTION LXIX.,"the sky, looking like autumnal clouds. Resolved on dying or conquering"
7121,SECTION LXIX.,"the foe in fight, those heroes sallied out seeking encounter. And those"
7122,SECTION LXIX.,"high-souled ones, incapable of being repressed in fight, roared and"
7123,SECTION LXIX.,shouted and discharged shafts and held them. And the earth shook as they
7124,SECTION LXIX.,sent up leonine roars and struck at their arms with their hands; and the
7125,SECTION LXIX.,sky seemed riven with the leonine roars of the Rakshas. And issuing out
7126,SECTION LXIX.,"cheerfully, those foremost of Rākshasas endowed with great strength"
7127,SECTION LXIX.,beheld that monkey-army staying with upraised rocks and stones. And the
7128,SECTION LXIX.,high souled monkeys also saw that mighty host of Rākshasas thronging
7129,SECTION LXIX.,"with elephants, horses and cars, and ringing with hundreds of bell-lets;"
7130,SECTION LXIX.,resembling dark-blue clouds; upraising mighty arms; and environed on all
7131,SECTION LXIX.,sides by Nairitas resembling flaming fire. And seeing that force
7132,SECTION LXIX.,"advance, the monkeys, finding opportunity, upraising giant crags,"
7133,SECTION LXIX.,"momentarily set up shouts. And thereat, the Rākshasas, incapable of"
7134,SECTION LXIX.,"bearing those shouts, shouted in reply unto the monkeys. And again the"
7135,SECTION LXIX.,"monkeys shouted unto the Rakshas, who were unable to put up with that"
7136,SECTION LXIX.,"cry. And hearing that loud shout of the monkey-leaders, the mighty"
7137,SECTION LXIX.,Rakshas incapable of bearing that noise expressive of
7138,SECTION LXIX.,"exhilaration,—shouted still more dreadfully. And then diving into that"
7139,SECTION LXIX.,"dreadful Rākshasa army, the monkey leaders began to range it with"
7140,SECTION LXIX.,"uplifted rocks,—like unto mountains. And equipped with trees and stones,"
7141,SECTION LXIX.,"the monkeys enraged, ranged the Raksha army, now rising into the sky."
7142,SECTION LXIX.,and now coming down to the earth. And some among the powerful monkeys
7143,SECTION LXIX.,went about taking broad-shouldered trees. And the encounter that took
7144,SECTION LXIX.,place between the thronging Rakshas and monkeys was something terrific.
7145,SECTION LXIX.,And (the monkeys) began to pour a wonderful shower of trees and rocks
7146,SECTION LXIX.,and cliffs. And the monkeys of dread prowess were resisted with vollies
7147,SECTION LXIX.,of shafts. And in the contest the monkeys and Rākshasas emitted leonine
7148,SECTION LXIX.,"roars. And monkeys crushed Yatudhānas with rocks, and, wrought with"
7149,SECTION LXIX.,"rage, (they) in the encounter slew (Rākshasas) covered with armour and"
7150,SECTION LXIX.,ornaments; and some slew heroes mounted on cars and elephants and
7151,SECTION LXIX.,steeds. And the monkeys on a sudden slew heroic Yātudhānas. And smit
7152,SECTION LXIX.,"with mountain-peaks on their persons, and with their eyes falling off,"
7153,SECTION LXIX.,"the foremost of Rākshasas moved, dropped down, or roared in the scene of"
7154,SECTION LXIX.,conflict. And the Rākshasas (on their part) pierced the foremost of
7155,SECTION LXIX.,monkeys with sharpened and keen darts and clubs and scimitars; and slew
7156,SECTION LXIX.,"them with darts and _prācas_. And, eager for bringing down each other,"
7157,SECTION LXIX.,"the monkeys and the Rākshasas with their persons, washed with the blood"
7158,SECTION LXIX.,of their antagonists felled each other. And in a moment the earth was
7159,SECTION LXIX.,"covered with crags and swords discharged by monkeys and Rākshasas,—and"
7160,SECTION LXIX.,was drenched in gore. And the field was blocked up with scattered
7161,SECTION LXIX.,"mountain-like Rakshas influenced by martial ardour,—mangled by their"
7162,SECTION LXIX.,enemies. And the monkeys thrown down and felled by means of broken crags
7163,SECTION LXIX.,"and monkeys²⁴³ and arms and legs,—waged a wonderful war. And those"
7164,SECTION LXIX.,foremost of Nairitas slew monkeys with (the dead bodies of monkeys); and
7165,SECTION LXIX.,the monkeys smote Rākshasas with (the dead bodies of) Rākshasas; and the
7166,SECTION LXIX.,"Rākshasas slew (the monkeys), hurling rocks and crags. And snatching"
7167,SECTION LXIX.,"away their own arms by main force, the monkeys finished Rakshas; and"
7168,SECTION LXIX.,"they slaughtered them with mountain-peaks, and also wounded each other."
7169,SECTION LXIX.,And the monkeys and Rākshasas emitted leonine roars in the encounter.
7170,SECTION LXIX.,"And the Rākshasas, slain by the monkeys, having their mail and defence"
7171,SECTION LXIX.,"for the body rent, bled like unto trees exuding sap. And in that"
7172,SECTION LXIX.,"encounter, some among the monkeys destroyed cars with cars, elephants"
7173,SECTION LXIX.,"with elephants, and steeds with steeds. And the Rākshasas rived the"
7174,SECTION LXIX.,trees and rocks of the foremost monkeys by means of _Kshurapras_ and
7175,SECTION LXIX.,"crescents and sharpened _Bhallas_ and arrows. And in that encounter, the"
7176,SECTION LXIX.,"earth became impassable, having been scattered with crags baffled and"
7177,SECTION LXIX.,severed trees and (warriors) slain by monkeys and Rakshas. And those
7178,SECTION LXIX.,"monkeys, equipped with various weapons, and with their vigor unworn,"
7179,SECTION LXIX.,"entering upon the conflict casting off fear,—cheerfully putting forth"
7180,SECTION LXIX.,"efforts springing from pride of spirit, warred on with the Rākshasas."
7181,SECTION LXIX.,"And in that fearful conflict, which was being waged, on the monkeys"
7182,SECTION LXIX.,"having been exhilarated and the Rākshasas having been brought down, the"
7183,SECTION LXIX.,Maharshis and the deities sent up shouts. Then mounted on a charger
7184,SECTION LXIX.,"endued with the celerity of the Wind, and grasping a whetted dart,"
7185,SECTION LXIX.,"Narāntaka entered into that fierce army of monkeys, like a fish diving"
7186,SECTION LXIX.,into the deep. And that hero by means of an effulgent bearded dart
7187,SECTION LXIX.,pierced seven hundred monkeys; and at one time the high-souled enemy of
7188,SECTION LXIX.,Indra slew the army of the foremost of monkeys. And the Vidyādharas and
7189,SECTION LXIX.,"Maharshis saw that high-souled one mounted on horseback, ranging the"
7190,SECTION LXIX.,"monkey-ranks. And his course was discovered, miry with flesh and blood"
7191,SECTION LXIX.,and blocked up with mountain-like monkeys fallen. And when the monkeys
7192,SECTION LXIX.,"set their hearts on displaying their prowess, Narāntaka, baffling them,"
7193,SECTION LXIX.,"pierced them with shafts. And he consumed the monkey-army, like fire"
7194,SECTION LXIX.,"burning a forest. And when the wood-rangers uprooted trees and crags,"
7195,SECTION LXIX.,they slain by bearded darts dropped down like mountains riven by the
7196,SECTION LXIX.,"thunder. And raising a glowing _prāça_, the powerful Narantaka began to"
7197,SECTION LXIX.,range about in the rear²⁴⁴ of the forces; dashing everywhere (against
7198,SECTION LXIX.,"the foe) in fight, like the wind in the rainy season. And the heroes"
7199,SECTION LXIX.,"could not appear prominently, or keep their posts. And how could they"
7200,SECTION LXIX.,"then move freely? And that one endued with prowess pierced everyone,"
7201,SECTION LXIX.,"whether springing, or staying, or moving. And broken through by a single"
7202,SECTION LXIX.,"_prāça_, resembling the Reaper, and furnished with solar effulgence, the"
7203,SECTION LXIX.,monkey-ranks began to roll on the earth. And the monkeys were ill fitted
7204,SECTION LXIX.,to bear the impetus of that _prāça_ having the touch of thunder itself;
7205,SECTION LXIX.,and they raised a loud cry. And the appearances of those monkey-heroes
7206,SECTION LXIX.,"falling were like mountains toppling, having their summits riven with"
7207,SECTION LXIX.,the thunder-bolt. Those high-souled and powerful monkeys that formerly
7208,SECTION LXIX.,"had been brought down by Kumbhakarna,—having recovered, were present"
7209,SECTION LXIX.,"with Sugriva in this encounter. And Sugriva, looking around, saw that"
7210,SECTION LXIX.,"monkey-army flying in all directions, agitated with the fear of"
7211,SECTION LXIX.,"Narantaka. And after seeing the army in flight, he saw Narantaka"
7212,SECTION LXIX.,"himself, advancing, wielding a _prāça_, and mounted on a steed. And as"
7213,SECTION LXIX.,"soon as he saw (that hero), the exceedingly energetic lord of"
7214,SECTION LXIX.,"monkeys—Sugriva—addressed the heroic prince Angada, endowed with"
7215,SECTION LXIX.,"strength equal to that of Indra, saying,—""Go against this heroic"
7216,SECTION LXIX.,Rākshasas that is mounted on a steed; and speedily deprive of life that
7217,SECTION LXIX.,"one who is devouring up the ranks of his foes"". Hearing his master’s"
7218,SECTION LXIX.,"speech, Angada descended from that host resembling clouds, like the"
7219,SECTION LXIX.,"powerful Sun himself. And resembling a mass of crags, Angada—foremost of"
7220,SECTION LXIX.,"monkeys—adorned with _Angadas_, appeared beautiful like a mountain with"
7221,SECTION LXIX.,"metals on it. And weaponless himself, and furnished only with nails and"
7222,SECTION LXIX.,"teeth, Vāli’s son attacking Narantaka, said,—""Stay! What shalt thou do"
7223,SECTION LXIX.,"with these interior monkeys? This _prāça_, having the feel of the"
7224,SECTION LXIX.,"thunder-bolt, do thou hurl at my heart itself"". Hearing Angada’s words,"
7225,SECTION LXIX.,Narantaka was fired with wrath. And knawing his upper lip with his teeth
7226,SECTION LXIX.,"and sighing like a serpent, Narāntaka, wrought with wrath, approached"
7227,SECTION LXIX.,"Vāli’s son. And then whirling his _prāça_, he suddenly discharged that"
7228,SECTION LXIX.,flaming (weapon) against Angada. And then it was snapped on the breast
7229,SECTION LXIX.,"of Vāli’s son, resembling the thunder-bolt, and dropped to the earth."
7230,SECTION LXIX.,"And seeing the _prāça_ broken in pieces, like a powerful snake severed"
7231,SECTION LXIX.,"by Suparna, Vāli’s son, raising his hand, dealt a slap at the head of"
7232,SECTION LXIX.,"his (Narāntaka’s) steed. Thereat, with his legs sinking down and his"
7233,SECTION LXIX.,"eye-balls coming off and his tongue hanging down, and wearing the look"
7234,SECTION LXIX.,"of a mountain,—on being smit with that slap, Narāntaka’s steed fell down"
7235,SECTION LXIX.,"to the ground, with its head lying at random. And Narāntaka seeing his"
7236,SECTION LXIX.,"charger slain and fallen, was seized with a furious wrath, and raising"
7237,SECTION LXIX.,"his clenched fist, that one endowed with exceeding great energy in that"
7238,SECTION LXIX.,conflict hit Vāli’s son on the head. Thereat Angada having his head
7239,SECTION LXIX.,"wounded by that blow, warm blood gushed out plentifully. And momentarily"
7240,SECTION LXIX.,"burning and momentarily swooning, he, regaining his senses, was amazed."
7241,SECTION LXIX.,"Then Vāli’s son, the high-souled Angada clenching his fist into a blow"
7242,SECTION LXIX.,"resembling Death itself in energy, and like unto a mountain-peak, let it"
7243,SECTION LXIX.,"descend on the chest of Narāntaka. Thereat, with his breast riven and"
7244,SECTION LXIX.,"broken down, vomitting flames and having his body bathed in blood,"
7245,SECTION LXIX.,"Narāntaka dropped down to the earth, like a hill shattered by the"
7246,SECTION LXIX.,impetus of the thunder-bolt. And on Narāntaka of exceeding prowess
7247,SECTION LXIX.,"having been slain by Vāli’s son in battle, there arose a tremendous"
7248,SECTION LXIX.,uproar in the firmament from the wood-rangers and the foremost of
7249,SECTION LXIX.,"celestials. And Angada having performed that difficult deed of prowess,"
7250,SECTION LXIX.,"capable of delighting the mind of Rāma, was seized with amazement;²⁴⁵"
7251,SECTION LXIX.,and that one of terrific feats in fight was again inspired with delight
7252,SECTION LXIX.,in the encounter.
7253,SECTION LXIX.,
7254,SECTION LXIX.,"And seeing Narāntaka slain, the foremost of Nairitas—including the"
7255,SECTION LXIX.,"three-headed Devāntaka and Pulastya’s descendant, Mahodara,—began to cry"
7256,SECTION LXIX.,"(in chorus). And then the vehement Mahodara, mounted (on horseback),"
7257,SECTION LXIX.,rushed against Vāli’s son endued with energy. And aggrieved in
7258,SECTION LXIX.,"consequence of the calamity that had befallen his brother, the strong"
7259,SECTION LXIX.,"Devāntaka grasping a dreadful bludgeon, darted against Angada. And"
7260,SECTION LXIX.,"ascending a car resembling the Sun yoked with superb steeds, the heroic"
7261,SECTION LXIX.,Triçiras rushed against Vāli’s son. Then charged by those three powerful
7262,SECTION LXIX.,"Rākshasas—crushers of the hauteur of immortals, Angada uprooted a tree"
7263,SECTION LXIX.,furnished with gigantic branches. And as Sakra hurleth the mighty
7264,SECTION LXIX.,"flaming thunderbolt, that hero—Angada—at once hurled against Devāntaka"
7265,SECTION LXIX.,that mighty tree having giant branches. And Triçiras cut off that tree
7266,SECTION LXIX.,in pieces by means of shafts resembling serpents. And seeing the tree
7267,SECTION LXIX.,"severed, Angada darted up; and²⁴⁶ then that foremost of monkeys showered"
7268,SECTION LXIX.,crags and trees. And all those Triçiras wrought with wrath cut off by
7269,SECTION LXIX.,means of whetted arrows; and Mahodara snapped those trees with the end
7270,SECTION LXIX.,of his bludgeon. And then Triçiras rushed against that hero—Vāli’s
7271,SECTION LXIX.,"son—with shafts; and Mahodara chased him,²⁴⁷ mounted on an elephant; and"
7272,SECTION LXIX.,struck Angada in the chest with _tomaras_ resembling the thunder-bolt.
7273,SECTION LXIX.,"And Devāntaka, enraged advancing, hit Angada with his bludgeon, and"
7274,SECTION LXIX.,"then, endowed with velocity, he swiftly turned away. And attacked"
7275,SECTION LXIX.,"simultaneonly by those three powerful Nairitas, the exceedingly"
7276,SECTION LXIX.,"energetic son of Vāli possessed of prowess, did not feel any pain. And"
7277,SECTION LXIX.,"that impetuous one incapable of being conquered, summoning his utmost"
7278,SECTION LXIX.,"vehemence, rushing on, pealt a slap at his²⁴⁸ mighty elephant. And"
7279,SECTION LXIX.,thereat the elephant fell down in his very sight and expired. And then
7280,SECTION LXIX.,"pulling out his tusks, the highly powerful son of Vāli, darting against"
7281,SECTION LXIX.,"Devāntaka, dealt him a blow therewith in that encounter. And thereupon"
7282,SECTION LXIX.,"that strong one overwhelmed like a tree buffetted by the wind, began to"
7283,SECTION LXIX.,"discharge blood profusely, looking like the hue of lac. And then"
7284,SECTION LXIX.,"cheering him, the exceedingly energetic and powerful Narāntaka,"
7285,SECTION LXIX.,"violently whirling his bludgeon with might and main, hit Angada with it."
7286,SECTION LXIX.,"And albeit struck with the bludgeon, the son of the lord of monkeys,"
7287,SECTION LXIX.,"going down on his knees, again darted up. And as he sprang up, Triçiras"
7288,SECTION LXIX.,hit at the temples of the son of the king of monkeys with three
7289,SECTION LXIX.,straight-speeding terrific shafts. And seeing Angada assailed by the
7290,SECTION LXIX.,"three redoubtable Rākshasas, Hanumān and Nila proceeded (to his rescue)."
7291,SECTION LXIX.,Then Nila hurled a mountain-top at Triçiras; and thereat that son of
7292,SECTION LXIX.,Rāvana severed it with sharpened arrows. And that mountain-top on being
7293,SECTION LXIX.,"riven, dropped down, aflame and shooting out sparks of fire. And seeing"
7294,SECTION LXIX.,"him²⁴⁹ yawning in joy, the stalwart Devāntaka in that encounter pursued"
7295,SECTION LXIX.,"the Wind-god’s son with his bludgeon. And as he rushed on, that foremost"
7296,SECTION LXIX.,"of monkeys—Hanumān—dealt on the crown of his head, a blow resembling the"
7297,SECTION LXIX.,thunder-bolt itself. And the mighty and heroic son of the Wind-god hit
7298,SECTION LXIX.,(at his antagonist); and that redoubted monkey also with his roars made
7299,SECTION LXIX.,the Rākshasas tremble (in fear). And thereat with his head crushed and
7300,SECTION LXIX.,"cleft, and his teeth and eyes falling out, and his tongue hanging down,"
7301,SECTION LXIX.,that son unto the sovereign of the Rākshasas suddenly dropped to the
7302,SECTION LXIX.,"earth, deprived of life. On that fierce and mighty Rākshasa warrior—that"
7303,SECTION LXIX.,"foe of the immortals—having fallen in fight, the Three-headed one,"
7304,SECTION LXIX.,waxing wondrous enraged began to shower terrific sharpened shafts on
7305,SECTION LXIX.,"Nila’s chest. And Mahodara, getting enraged, again swiftly mounted an"
7306,SECTION LXIX.,elephant like the ray-furnished (Sun) mounting Mandara. Then even as a
7307,SECTION LXIX.,mass of roaring clouds poureth down showers enwheeled with levin on a
7308,SECTION LXIX.,"mountain, he showered arrows right on Nila’s breast. Thereat showered"
7309,SECTION LXIX.,"with those shafts, that leader of monkeys Nila with his person pierced,"
7310,SECTION LXIX.,had his body riven and was stupified by that exceedingly powerful one.
7311,SECTION LXIX.,"Then that (monkey) possessed of tremendous vehemence, having regained"
7312,SECTION LXIX.,"his senses, uprooting a crag with a whole tract of trees, struck it at"
7313,SECTION LXIX.,"Mahodara’s head. And struck by that mighty enemy, Mahodara, broken down"
7314,SECTION LXIX.,"by the impetus of that rock, deprived of his senses, dropped down dead"
7315,SECTION LXIX.,"on the ground, like a cliff smit with the thunder-bolt."
7316,SECTION LXIX.,
7317,SECTION LXIX.,"Seeing his uncle slain, Triçiras took up his bow; and inflamed with fury"
7318,SECTION LXIX.,"pierced Hanumān with whetted arrows. And thereat the Wind-god’s son,"
7319,SECTION LXIX.,"enraged, hurled a mountain-peak (at his adversary). And Triçiras by"
7320,SECTION LXIX.,means of keen arrows severed the same in shivers. And seeing the
7321,SECTION LXIX.,"mountain-peak baffled, the monkey in the encounter began to shower trees"
7322,SECTION LXIX.,on Rāvana’s son. And Triçiras endowed with prowess by means of sharpened
7323,SECTION LXIX.,shafts cut off that descending arrowy shower in the sky and shouted (in
7324,SECTION LXIX.,"delight). Then Hanumān flying into a fury, bounding to the welkin, with"
7325,SECTION LXIX.,"his nails ripped the steed of Triçiras, even as a lion cleaveth a"
7326,SECTION LXIX.,powerful elephant. Then taking a dart even as the Destroyer employeth
7327,SECTION LXIX.,"the Fatal Night, Rāvana’s son—Triçiras—discharged it at the offspring of"
7328,SECTION LXIX.,the Wind-god. Thereat catching the dart of resistless course as it
7329,SECTION LXIX.,"descended from the sky, the powerful monkey snapped it and then shouted."
7330,SECTION LXIX.,"And seeing that dreadful dart broken by Hanumān, the monkeys,"
7331,SECTION LXIX.,"transported with delight, sent up shouts, even as clouds rumble. Than"
7332,SECTION LXIX.,"upraising his sword, that foremost of Rākshasas—Triçiras—brought it down"
7333,SECTION LXIX.,"on the breast of the monkey-chief. Overpowered with the sword-blow,"
7334,SECTION LXIX.,"Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god,—endowed with energy, dealt the"
7335,SECTION LXIX.,"Three-headed one a slap on the head. And smitten with that slap, the"
7336,SECTION LXIX.,"highly powerful Triçiras, with his hands and attire dropping off, fell"
7337,SECTION LXIX.,"down to the earth, deprived of consciousness. Then that mighty monkey"
7338,SECTION LXIX.,"resembling a hill broke his sword as he fell, and roared, terrifying all"
7339,SECTION LXIX.,"the Rākshasas. But not brooking that uproar, that night-ranger sprang"
7340,SECTION LXIX.,"up; and springing up, he dealt a blow at Hanumān. And at that blow, the"
7341,SECTION LXIX.,"redoubtable monkey was wrought up with wrath; and inflamed with rage, he"
7342,SECTION LXIX.,smote that foremost of Rākshasas about his diadem. And then with a sharp
7343,SECTION LXIX.,sword the Wind-god’s son cut off his heads decked with diadems and
7344,SECTION LXIX.,furnished with ear-rings; even as Sakra had severed the heads of
7345,SECTION LXIX.,"Tashtri’s son.²⁵⁰ Thereat even as burning stars, loosened, drop down"
7346,SECTION LXIX.,"from the course of Indra, the large organs of sense, and eyes flaming"
7347,SECTION LXIX.,"like glowing fire, and heads of that foe of Indra, dropped down to the"
7348,SECTION LXIX.,ground. On Triçiras—enemy of the immortals—having been slain by Hanumān
7349,SECTION LXIX.,"endowed with the prowess itself of Sakra, the monkeys shouted, the earth"
7350,SECTION LXIX.,"shook, and the Rakshas began to fly on all sides. And seeing Triçiras"
7351,SECTION LXIX.,and Yudhyonmatta slain and seeing also the irrepressible Devāntaka and
7352,SECTION LXIX.,"Narāntaka slain (in the encounter), that highly irascible and powerful"
7353,SECTION LXIX.,"Rākshasa—Matta—was transported with passion, and then took up a flaming"
7354,SECTION LXIX.,mace entirely wrought with iron inlaid with gold; frothy with flesh and
7355,SECTION LXIX.,gore; mighty to behold; gratified with the blood of foes; with its end
7356,SECTION LXIX.,flaming in splendour; decked with red wreaths; and capable of striking
7357,SECTION LXIX.,terror into Airāvata and Mahāpadma and Sārvabhauma.²⁵¹ And flaming up
7358,SECTION LXIX.,"like the Fire arisen at the end of a Yuga, that foremost of"
7359,SECTION LXIX.,"Rākshasas—Matta—wrought with fury,—rushed against the monkeys. Then the"
7360,SECTION LXIX.,"mighty and powerful monkey—Rishabha—springing up before Rāvana’s son,"
7361,SECTION LXIX.,stood before the hosts of Matta. And seeing that mountain-like monkey
7362,SECTION LXIX.,"staying before (him), Matta, enraged, dealt him a blow on the breast."
7363,SECTION LXIX.,"And smit with the mace, that foremost of monkeys, with his breast riven"
7364,SECTION LXIX.,"and trembling, began to bleed copiously. And regaining his senses after"
7365,SECTION LXIX.,"a long while, Rishabha—lord of monkeys—inflamed with wrath, pouting out"
7366,SECTION LXIX.,"his upper lip, gazed at Mahāpārçwa.²⁵² And then impetuously approaching"
7367,SECTION LXIX.,"the Rākshasa, that foremost of heroic monkeys resembling a hill, endowed"
7368,SECTION LXIX.,"with vehemence, clenching his fist, suddenly smote him with a blow on"
7369,SECTION LXIX.,"his breast. Thereat like a tree whose roots have been severed, he"
7370,SECTION LXIX.,"suddenly dropped on the ground, covered with blood. And thereupon,"
7371,SECTION LXIX.,(Rishabha) swiftly snatched his dreadful mace resembling the rod of Yama
7372,SECTION LXIX.,himself; and shouted. Only for a moment did he²⁵³ remain like one dead.
7373,SECTION LXIX.,"Recovering his senses, the enemy of the immortals, looking like evening"
7374,SECTION LXIX.,"clouds in hue, suddenly springing up, attacked the son of the king of"
7375,SECTION LXIX.,"waters.²⁵⁴ And thereat, he dropped down to the earth, senseless. In a"
7376,SECTION LXIX.,"moment regaining his consciousness, he again bounded up,—and whirling"
7377,SECTION LXIX.,"the mace resembling a peak of the foremost of mountains, in that"
7378,SECTION LXIX.,encounter dealt (Matta) a blow therewith. And descending on the body of
7379,SECTION LXIX.,"that dreadful one—the enemy of deities, sacrifices and Vipras—that"
7380,SECTION LXIX.,"terrific mace rived his breast; and he began to bleed profusely, even as"
7381,SECTION LXIX.,the lord of mountains discharges minerals and water. And taking the
7382,SECTION LXIX.,terrific mace of the high-souled (Matta) and swinging it again and
7383,SECTION LXIX.,"again, (Rishabha) rushed (against the Rākshasas). And that high-souled"
7384,SECTION LXIX.,one began to slaughter Matta’s forces in the field. And broken down by
7385,SECTION LXIX.,"his own mace, Matta dropped down like a hill, with his teeth and eyes"
7386,SECTION LXIX.,shrivelled up; and he dropped to the earth deprived of strength and
7387,SECTION LXIX.,"life, with his eyes paling. And on that Rākshasa falling, the Rākshasa"
7388,SECTION LXIX.,"forces began to fly. And on that brother of Rāvana having been slain,"
7389,SECTION LXIX.,"that host of Nairitas appearing like the ocean in grandeur, leaving its"
7390,SECTION LXIX.,"arms behind,—solely for life rushed away, like unto the deep riven (by"
7391,SECTION LXIX.,the winds).

7438,SECTION LXXI.,"Atikāya—resembling a hill, who had obtained from Brahmā a boon in"
7439,SECTION LXXI.,"battle, was fired with wrath. Ascending a car effulgent like a thousand"
7440,SECTION LXXI.,"suns mingling their rays into a burst of brilliance, that enemy of"

7442,SECTION LXXI.,"with a diadem and wearing polished ear-rings, proclaimed his name (among"

7444,SECTION LXXI.,"and the proclamation of his name, and the tremendous twang of his"
7445,SECTION LXXI.,"bow-string, he struck terror into the monkeys. Seeing the magnitude of"
7446,SECTION LXXI.,"his person, the monkeys thinking that it was Kumbhakarna who had"
7447,SECTION LXXI.,"come,—and affrighted thereat, sought the shelter of each other. And"
7448,SECTION LXXI.,seeing his form like unto that of Vishnu when he displayed his threefold

7450,SECTION LXXI.,"sides. And on Atikāya appearing before them, the monkeys, stupified in"
7451,SECTION LXXI.,"that conflict, saught the shelter of Lakshmana’s elder brother. And from"

7455,SECTION LXXI.,"Rāghava struck with surprise, comforting the monkeys, addressed"
7456,SECTION LXXI.,"Bibhishana, saying,—""Who is this one resembling a mountain, furnished"
7457,SECTION LXXI.,"with a bow and having leonine eyes, that is stationed on a large car"
7458,SECTION LXXI.,"yoked with a thousand steeds,—he that with effulgent sharpened darts and"
7459,SECTION LXXI.,"keen _prāças_ and _tomaras_, shineth like Maheçwara environed by"
7460,SECTION LXXI.,"spectres—he that displaying his fatal tongue, appeareth splendid,"
7461,SECTION LXXI.,surrounded with darts in his car; like a mass of clouds graced with
7462,SECTION LXXI.,"lightning. And his bows adorned and backed with gold all over, beautify"
7463,SECTION LXXI.,his car even as Indra’s bow beautifyeth the firmament. And who is this
7464,SECTION LXXI.,foremost of Rākshasas and best of bowmen that embellishing the field of
7465,SECTION LXXI.,"battle, approacheth on a car glorious as the sun; who, displaying the"
7466,SECTION LXXI.,"ten cardinal points with his shafts resembling the rays of the sun,"
7467,SECTION LXXI.,appeareth handsome with his peak of a banner bearing the figure of
7468,SECTION LXXI.,"Rāhu—whose bow bent in three places, emitting roars resembling the"
7469,SECTION LXXI.,"rumbling of clouds, and plated with gold, looketh like the bow itself of"
7470,SECTION LXXI.,Satakratu? And his mighty car furnished with a banner and ensign and
7471,SECTION LXXI.,"bottom, and having clatter resembling the roaring of clouds, hath four"
7472,SECTION LXXI.,horsemen (attached to it). And there are on the car eight and thirty
7473,SECTION LXXI.,quivers and dreadful bows and yellow-golden bow-strings. And there are
7474,SECTION LXXI.,"(in that car) two effulgent swords at his side, illumining it,—their"
7475,SECTION LXXI.,hafts measuring four hands and their blades ten each. And that calm
7476,SECTION LXXI.,"(warrior) wears red garlands about his neck, and resembles a mighty"
7477,SECTION LXXI.,"mountain. And a very Destroyer, he hath a mighty mouth, appearing like"
7478,SECTION LXXI.,that of the Destroyer himself; and he looketh like the sun stationed on
7479,SECTION LXXI.,"clouds. And with his arms adorned with golden _angadas_, he appeareth"
7480,SECTION LXXI.,splendid like that best of mountains—the Himavān with its towering
7481,SECTION LXXI.,"summits. And with his pair of ear-rings, his charming yet terrific"
7482,SECTION LXXI.,countenance shineth like the full Moon entering into Punarvaçu.²⁵⁵ O
7483,SECTION LXXI.,"mighty-armed one, tell me all about this foremost of Rākshasas, seeing"
7484,SECTION LXXI.,"whom the monkeys, overwhelmed with fear, fly away in all directions""."
7485,SECTION LXXI.,Asked by the king’s son—Rāma of immeasurable prowess—the exceedingly
7486,SECTION LXXI.,"energetic Bibhishana spoke unto Rāma, informing him,—""The highly"
7487,SECTION LXXI.,"powerful king, Vaisravana’s younger brother of dreadful deeds, the"
7488,SECTION LXXI.,high-souled Rāvana—is the sovereign of the Rākshasas. This one is his
7489,SECTION LXXI.,"mighty son, like unto Rāvana himself in strength. He serveth the aged,"
7490,SECTION LXXI.,is of wide celebrity and is the prime of those versed in all branches of
7491,SECTION LXXI.,"knowledge. And he is competent to ride horses and elephants, to wield"
7492,SECTION LXXI.,"the sword or draw the bow,—or in sowing dissensions, or giving away, or"
7493,SECTION LXXI.,"in counsel,—he reposing in whose arm Lankā hath cast off fear. Know him"
7494,SECTION LXXI.,"to be Atikāya, son unto Dhānyamāli. Having adored the pure-souled Brahmā"
7495,SECTION LXXI.,"with austerities, he hath obtained weapons, and hath defeated his foes"
7496,SECTION LXXI.,"(in fight)"". ’Thou shalt be incapable of being slain by celestials and"
7497,SECTION LXXI.,Asuras’—was the boon conferred on him by the Self-sprung; and he also
7498,SECTION LXXI.,gave him this celestial mail and this car resembling the effulgent Sun
7499,SECTION LXXI.,himself. He hath vanquished (in battle) hundreds of deities and Dānavas;
7500,SECTION LXXI.,"and he hath (always) protected the Rakshas, and destroyed Yakshas. And"
7501,SECTION LXXI.,this intelligent one resisted the thunder-bolt itself of Indra; and in
7502,SECTION LXXI.,encounter baffled the very noose of the king of waters. This one is
7503,SECTION LXXI.,Atikāya—foremost of Rākshasas; and that son of Rāvana is the humbler of
7504,SECTION LXXI.,"the hauteur of deities and Dānavas. Therefore, O best of persons, do"
7505,SECTION LXXI.,thou endeavour thy best. This one with his shafts slaughtered the
7506,SECTION LXXI.,"monkey-hosts before (us)"". And then the powerful Atikāya entering that"
7507,SECTION LXXI.,"monkey-force, stretched his bow and shouted again and again. And the"
7508,SECTION LXXI.,"high-souled principal monkeys, seeing that (hero) possessed of a"
7509,SECTION LXXI.,"dreadful person, that best of car-warriors—stationed on his car, rushed"
7510,SECTION LXXI.,forward. And Kumuda and Dwivida and Mainda and Nila and Sabha dashed on
7511,SECTION LXXI.,at one time with trees and mountain-peaks. Thereupon that foremost of
7512,SECTION LXXI.,"those skilled in weapons, the exceedingly energetic Atikāya, severed"
7513,SECTION LXXI.,those trees and rocks by means of shafts dight with gold. And in that
7514,SECTION LXXI.,"encounter that powerful one possessed of a gigantic person, skilled in"
7515,SECTION LXXI.,"arms, pierced all those monkeys staying before him with arrows entirely"
7516,SECTION LXXI.,"made of iron. And agonised, having their persons pierced in that mighty"
7517,SECTION LXXI.,"conflict by that arrowy shower, they were incapable of resisting the"
7518,SECTION LXXI.,"same. And the Rākshasa terrified that host of monkey-heroes, even as an"
7519,SECTION LXXI.,enraged lion priding in his youth terrifyeth a society of deer. And in
7520,SECTION LXXI.,"the midst of those bands of monkeys, that lord of Rākshasas did not slay"
7521,SECTION LXXI.,"anyone without battle. And then springing up before Rāma, that one"
7522,SECTION LXXI.,"furnished with his bow and quiver, addressed him in haughty words,"
7523,SECTION LXXI.,"saying,—""Stationed in this car holding the bow and arrows in my hands, I"
7524,SECTION LXXI.,"will not fight any that is ignoble. Him that hath strength, and that"
7525,SECTION LXXI.,"also understandeth this business,—let him today speedily give me"
7526,SECTION LXXI.,"battle"". Hearing his speech, that slayer of foes—Sumitrā’s son—was fired"
7527,SECTION LXXI.,"with wrath. And not bearing him, he sprang forward disregarding his"
7528,SECTION LXXI.,"antagonist’s words, and took up his bow. And flying unto fury, Sumitrā’s"
7529,SECTION LXXI.,"son, darting up, took out arrows from his quiver, and stretched his"
7530,SECTION LXXI.,mighty bow in front of Atikāya. And filling the entire earth and the sky
7531,SECTION LXXI.,"and the ocean and all the cardinal quarters,—the terrific twang of"
7532,SECTION LXXI.,Lakshmana’s bow struck terror into the (hearts of the) night-rangers.
7533,SECTION LXXI.,"And hearing the dreadful twang of the bow of Sumitrā’s son, the"
7534,SECTION LXXI.,exceedingly energetic and powerful son of the lord of Rākshasas was
7535,SECTION LXXI.,"struck with surprise. Then Atikāya, enraged, seeing Lakshmana advance,"
7536,SECTION LXXI.,"taking sharpened shafts, spoke unto him,—""Thou art a boy, O Sumitrā’s"
7537,SECTION LXXI.,son; and as such knowest not how to display prowess. Go thou. Why
7538,SECTION LXXI.,wishest thou to fight with me resembling Death itself. Not Himālaya
7539,SECTION LXXI.,itself or the firmament or the earth is capable of bearing the
7540,SECTION LXXI.,impetuosity of shafts shot by my arms. Thou wishest to rouse a fire
7541,SECTION LXXI.,"slumbering sweetly. Leaving alone thy bow, do thou return. Do not lose"
7542,SECTION LXXI.,thy life by coming in contact with me. Or it may be that thou art proud;
7543,SECTION LXXI.,"and, therefore, hast no mind to return. Stay then. Renouncing thy life,"
7544,SECTION LXXI.,thou shalt go to Yama’s mansion. Behold my whetted arrows—crushers of
7545,SECTION LXXI.,the insolence of foes—resembling the weapon itself of the
7546,SECTION LXXI.,"Lord,²⁵⁶—adorned with burnished gold. And even as a lion enraged"
7547,SECTION LXXI.,"sheddeth the blood of a mighty elephant, this arrow of mine resembling a"
7548,SECTION LXXI.,"serpent shall shed thy blood"". Having delivered himself thus, he fired"
7549,SECTION LXXI.,with wrath set his shaft on his bow. Hearing in that encounter Atikāya’s
7550,SECTION LXXI.,"wrathful speech fraught with hauteur, the highly powerful and"
7551,SECTION LXXI.,"intelligent son of the king possessed of exceeding grace, was"
7552,SECTION LXXI.,"transported with passion; and he said,—""Thou canst not attain"
7553,SECTION LXXI.,pre-eminence solely by virtue of thy speech. One cannot be a worthy
7554,SECTION LXXI.,"person simply by say. O wicked-minded one, do thou display thy strength"
7555,SECTION LXXI.,on me equipped with the bow and holding arrows in my hands. To-day shall
7556,SECTION LXXI.,"my shafts decked in gold, drink thy blood flowing from thy person and"
7557,SECTION LXXI.,issuing out of wounds inflicted by my arrows resembling darts.—’This one
7558,SECTION LXXI.,"is a boy’, thinking this, thou ought not to slight me. Whether I am a"
7559,SECTION LXXI.,boy or an old²⁵⁷ man—death shalt thou know in the conflict. It was as a
7560,SECTION LXXI.,"boy that Vishnu had overpowered the triune world with his prowess""."
7561,SECTION LXXI.,"Hearing Lakshmana’s words, fraught with reason and high sense,"
7562,SECTION LXXI.,"Vidyādharas and ghosts, deities, Daityas and Maharshis, and the"
7563,SECTION LXXI.,high-souled Guhyakas then beheld that marvel.²⁵⁸
7564,SECTION LXXI.,
7565,SECTION LXXI.,"Then Atikāya, enraged, setting his arrow on his bow, shot it at"
7566,SECTION LXXI.,"Lakshmana, as if devouring up the welkin. Thereat, Lakshmana—slayer of"
7567,SECTION LXXI.,hostile heroes—with a crescent severed that sharpened shaft resembling a
7568,SECTION LXXI.,"venomous serpent, as it was descending. And seeing the shaft severed,"
7569,SECTION LXXI.,"like a serpent having its person cut off, Atikāya waxing exceedingly"
7570,SECTION LXXI.,"enraged, took up five arrows; and the night-ranger discharged them at"
7571,SECTION LXXI.,Lakshmana. Thereat Bharata’s younger brother cut off the approaching
7572,SECTION LXXI.,arrows with whetted shafts. And having severed them with sharpened
7573,SECTION LXXI.,"shafts, Lakshmana—slayer of hostile heroes—took up a sharpened arrow, as"
7574,SECTION LXXI.,"if flaming in energy. And taking it, Lakshmana set it on his excellent"
7575,SECTION LXXI.,"bow; and drawing the latter, vigorously discharged the shaft. And that"
7576,SECTION LXXI.,hero endowed with prowess hit that foremost of Rākshasas in the forehead
7577,SECTION LXXI.,"with that shaft having bent knots, discharged from his bow drawn to its"
7578,SECTION LXXI.,full bent.—And that arrow piercing the forehead of that dreadful
7579,SECTION LXXI.,"Rākshasa, and smeared with blood, appeared like the lord of serpents in"
7580,SECTION LXXI.,"a mountain. And the Rākshasa, smarting under Lakshmana’s shaft,"
7581,SECTION LXXI.,"showered, like the dreadful gateway of Tripuri battered by Rudra. Then"
7582,SECTION LXXI.,"recovering himself and reflecting, he said,²⁵⁹—""Excellent well! By this"
7583,SECTION LXXI.,"discharge of thy shaft, thou approvest thyself as a foe in whom I can"
7584,SECTION LXXI.,"well glory"". Having spoken thus candidly, he, folding his hands at ease,"
7585,SECTION LXXI.,"and seated on the platform of his car, began to range in it. And then"
7586,SECTION LXXI.,"that foremost of Rākshasas began to take up, set, and shoot one, three,"
7587,SECTION LXXI.,"five, or seven shafts. And those shafts resembling Fate itself, plated"
7588,SECTION LXXI.,"with gold at the feathered parts,—and looking like the Sun himself (in"
7589,SECTION LXXI.,"splendour),—discharged from the bow of the lord of Rākshasas, lighted up"
7590,SECTION LXXI.,the heavens. Thereat Rāghava’s younger brother by means of many a
7591,SECTION LXXI.,sharpened shaft calmly cut off all those vollies of arrows shot by the
7592,SECTION LXXI.,"Rākshasa. And finding all those arrows riven in the encounter, that"
7593,SECTION LXXI.,"enemy of the lord of the immortals, Rāvana’s son, was fired with wrath,"
7594,SECTION LXXI.,"and took up a whetted shaft. And then aiming that arrow, that highly"
7595,SECTION LXXI.,"powerful one suddenly shot it; and with that, rushing on, hit Sumitrā’s"
7596,SECTION LXXI.,"son in the chest. And struck in the encounter by Atikāya, the son of"
7597,SECTION LXXI.,"Sumitrā began to bleed copiously, like a mad elephant discharging the"
7598,SECTION LXXI.,temporal juice. And then that lord at once extricated the arrow; and
7599,SECTION LXXI.,then took up a keen shaft and fixed the same on his weapon.²⁶⁰ And then
7600,SECTION LXXI.,he set a shaft (on his bow-string) reciting a formula for the Agneya²⁶¹
7601,SECTION LXXI.,weapon; and thereat his arrow as well as bow flamed up. Then the highly
7602,SECTION LXXI.,powerful Atikāya took up a Raudra²⁶² weapon; and thereon fixed a shaft
7603,SECTION LXXI.,"plated with gold at the feathered part, and resembling a serpent in"
7604,SECTION LXXI.,"sheen. And even as the Reaper hurleth his rod, did Lakshmana hurl that"
7605,SECTION LXXI.,"weapon inspired with divine energy, dreadful and aflame,—at Atikāya. And"
7606,SECTION LXXI.,"seeing that shaft set upon an Agneya weapon, that night-ranger"
7607,SECTION LXXI.,discharged a Raudra arrow set upon a Solar weapon. And there like a pair
7608,SECTION LXXI.,"of infuriated serpents, those arrows with their heads flaming in energy,"
7609,SECTION LXXI.,"baffled each other in the sky. And burning each other, the shafts fell"
7610,SECTION LXXI.,"on the earth; and those best of arrows, shorn of brilliance and reduced"
7611,SECTION LXXI.,"to ashes, were deprived of their splendour. And having blazed in the"
7612,SECTION LXXI.,"welkin, those two fell down to the earth reft of their lustre, Then"
7613,SECTION LXXI.,Atikāya wrought up with wrath discharged an arrow called Aishika
7614,SECTION LXXI.,dedicated to Tashtri. Thereat the powerful son of Sumitrā severed that
7615,SECTION LXXI.,"shaft by an Aindra²⁶³ weapon. Seeing Aishika baffled, that Prince—son"
7616,SECTION LXXI.,"unto Rāvana—fired with rage, fixed an arrow on a Yamya²⁶⁴ weapon; and"
7617,SECTION LXXI.,then the night-ranger shot that weapon at Lakshmana. And Lakshmana
7618,SECTION LXXI.,resisted it by a Vāyavya²⁶⁵ weapon. And then as a mass of clouds poureth
7619,SECTION LXXI.,"down showers, Lakshmana, enraged, poured volleys of shafts on Rāvana’s"
7620,SECTION LXXI.,"son. Thereupon, hitting Atikāya, those arrows coming in contact with his"
7621,SECTION LXXI.,"mail, had their barbs broken, and fell down to the earth. And seeing"
7622,SECTION LXXI.,"them baffled, that slayer of hostile heroes—the renowned Lakshmana—began"
7623,SECTION LXXI.,"to shower shafts by thousands. And albeit showered with those arrows,"
7624,SECTION LXXI.,that Rākshasa—the mighty Atikāya—in that encounter was not pierced by
7625,SECTION LXXI.,them on account of his impenetrable mail; and that best of men failed to
7626,SECTION LXXI.,"hurt him in the contest. Then approaching him, the Wind-god spake unto"
7627,SECTION LXXI.,"him, saying,—""This one hath received a boon from Brahmā, and is covered"
7628,SECTION LXXI.,with an impenetrable mail. Pierce him with a Brāhma²⁶⁶ weapon. He cannot
7629,SECTION LXXI.,otherwise be slain. This one clad in mail and endowed with prowess is
7630,SECTION LXXI.,"forsooth incapable of being slain by others"". Hearing the words of the"
7631,SECTION LXXI.,"Wind-god, Sumitrā’s son like unto Indra in prowess took an arrow endowed"
7632,SECTION LXXI.,"with fierce impetuosity, and at once set it on a Brāhma weapon. And on"
7633,SECTION LXXI.,that sharp-headed best of arrows being fixed on that foremost of
7634,SECTION LXXI.,"weapons, the cardinal quarters and the Moon and the Sun and the mighty"
7635,SECTION LXXI.,planets and the sky were seized with affright; and the earth shook. And
7636,SECTION LXXI.,inspiring that arrow furnished with a feathered part and resembling an
7637,SECTION LXXI.,"emissary of Yama himself, and fixing the same an his bow, Sumitrā’s son"
7638,SECTION LXXI.,in that encounter discharged that shaft like unto the thunder-bolt at
7639,SECTION LXXI.,the son of the enemy of Indra. And in that conflict Atikāya beheld that
7640,SECTION LXXI.,shaft fair-feathered and having its feathered part dight with splendid
7641,SECTION LXXI.,"diamonds, acquiring enhanced vehemence arising from its having been"
7642,SECTION LXXI.,"discharged by Lakshmana,—and hissing and rushing on with tremendous"
7643,SECTION LXXI.,"impetuosity. And seeing it, Atikāya swiftly resisted it with countless"
7644,SECTION LXXI.,"sharpened shafts. But endowed with the energy of Suparna himself, that"
7645,SECTION LXXI.,shaft vehemently went to him. And seeing that shaft flaming and
7646,SECTION LXXI.,"resembling the Fatal Destroyer himself,—coming, he, exerting himself to"
7647,SECTION LXXI.,the utmost resisted it with darts and _rishtis_ and maces and adzes and
7648,SECTION LXXI.,javelins and arrows. But beating down all those weapons of wonderful
7649,SECTION LXXI.,"forms, that arrow alive with flames, coming to the diadem-decked head of"
7650,SECTION LXXI.,"Atikāya, severed the same (in twain) And that head furnished with a"
7651,SECTION LXXI.,"corsalet, cut off by Lakshmana’s arrow, suddenly dropped to the earth,"
7652,SECTION LXXI.,like a summit of Himavān toppling (to the ground). Seeing him rolling on
7653,SECTION LXXI.,"the earth, with his attire and ornaments scattered about, those"
7654,SECTION LXXI.,night-rangers that survived were overwhelmed with grief. And with pale
7655,SECTION LXXI.,"forces and distressed, they, fatigued in consequence of the thrashing"
7656,SECTION LXXI.,"they had undergone, suddenly began to cry in frightful accents. And on"
7657,SECTION LXXI.,"their leader having been slain, those night-rangers that were about"
7658,SECTION LXXI.,"(Atikāya), without waiting any longer,—overwhelmed with panic, rushed"
7659,SECTION LXXI.,towards the city. And on their foe endowed with terrific prowess and
7660,SECTION LXXI.,"incapable of being confronted, having been slain, innumerable monkeys"
7661,SECTION LXXI.,"filled with excess of joy, and displaying countenances resembling blown"
7662,SECTION LXXI.,"lotuses, paid homage unto Lakshmana working out their welfare."

7758,SECTION LXXIII.,"of Hari himself, that exceedingly powerful repressor of enemies at once"
7759,SECTION LXXIII.,"set out for the field of battle. And as that high-souled (hero) marched,"
7760,SECTION LXXIII.,he was followed by countless mighty (Rākshasas) breathing spirits;
7761,SECTION LXXIII.,"bearing bows in their strong hands. And some of those, resembling"

7763,SECTION LXXIII.,"some on bears, and some on beasts of prey, and some on lions and"
7764,SECTION LXXIII.,"jackals,—and some of the Rākshasas endowed with dreadful vigor were"

7766,SECTION LXXIII.,equipped with _prāças_ and maces and _nistrinças_ and axes and clubs.
7767,SECTION LXXIII.,And all sides were filled with the blares of conchs and the sounds of
7768,SECTION LXXIII.,kettle-drums. And then that enemy of the lord of celestials marched
7769,SECTION LXXIII.,"forth with impetuosity. And with an umbrella hued like the Moon, that"
7770,SECTION LXXIII.,destroyer of enemies appeared like the full Moon stationed in the sky.
7771,SECTION LXXIII.,And that hero garnished in golden ornaments—that foremost of all
7772,SECTION LXXIII.,bowmen—was fanned by an excellent and graceful golden _chowri_. And with
7773,SECTION LXXIII.,"Indrajit furnished with the splendour of the Sun himself, and possessed"

7775,SECTION LXXIII.,graced with the glorious Sun.
7776,SECTION LXXIII.,
7777,SECTION LXXIII.,"Arriving at the scene of conflict, that highly powerful repressor of"
7778,SECTION LXXIII.,foes arrayed his forces around the car. And then that foremost of
7779,SECTION LXXIII.,Rākshasas with choice mantras duly offered libations unto Fire.²⁶⁷ And
7780,SECTION LXXIII.,that powerful lord of Rākshasas there worshipping Fire with fragrant
7781,SECTION LXXIII.,"wreaths and fried paddy, sacrificed unto it. And arms served for _Kāça_"
7782,SECTION LXXIII.,and _Bibhitakas_ for fuel; and there were red cloths and a ladle made of
7783,SECTION LXXIII.,"black iron. And spreading Fire there, with _tomaras_ representing"
7784,SECTION LXXIII.,"_Kāça_, he seized the neck of a living goat. And then the kindled"
7785,SECTION LXXIII.,"smokeless fire blazing up brilliantly, displayed signs betokening"
7786,SECTION LXXIII.,"victory. Thereat, with his right tongue whirling, the Deity of Fire"
7787,SECTION LXXIII.,"himself looking like one made of gold,—arising, accepted the offering."
7788,SECTION LXXIII.,And then that (Rākshasa) skilled in weapons acquired a Brāhma weapon
7789,SECTION LXXIII.,"(from that Deity), and inspired his bow and car with _mantras_. On that"
7790,SECTION LXXIII.,"weapon having been invoked,²⁶⁸ and on (the god of Fire) also having been"
7791,SECTION LXXIII.,"worshipped, the firmament furnished with the suns and stars and planets"
7792,SECTION LXXIII.,"was afflicted with affright. Having worshipped (the god of Fire), that"
7793,SECTION LXXIII.,"one endowed with the splendour of Fire itself, that one possessed of the"
7794,SECTION LXXIII.,"prowess of the great Indra and gifted with inconceivable vigor,"
7795,SECTION LXXIII.,accoutred in bows and arrows and swords and having steeds and cars and
7796,SECTION LXXIII.,"darts,—disappeared in the sky. Then burning for battle, setting up roars"
7797,SECTION LXXIII.,"went out the Rākshasa ranks, thronging with steeds and cars, and graced"
7798,SECTION LXXIII.,with pennons and standards. And they fell to slaughtering monkeys in the
7799,SECTION LXXIII.,"engagement with countless shafts, sharp, variegated and decorated; as"
7800,SECTION LXXIII.,"also with _tomaras_ and _hooks_. And Rāvana’s son, fired with wrath,"
7801,SECTION LXXIII.,"seeing those night-rangers, addressed them, saying,—""Do ye, burning with"
7802,SECTION LXXIII.,"a desire to destroy the monkeys, fight cheerfully"". Thereat all those"
7803,SECTION LXXIII.,"Rākshasas, eager for victory, smitting roars, covered the dreadful"
7804,SECTION LXXIII.,monkeys with showers of shafts. And environed by Rakshas in that
7805,SECTION LXXIII.,"encounter, he²⁶⁹ poured on the monkeys _nālikas_ and _narāchas_ and"
7806,SECTION LXXIII.,"maces and clubs. And trembling in the encounter, those monkeys armed"
7807,SECTION LXXIII.,with trees at once began to shower rocks and trees on Rāvana’s son. Then
7808,SECTION LXXIII.,"the exceedingly powerful Indrajit, son unto Rāvana, endowed with"
7809,SECTION LXXIII.,"wondrous energy, pierced the bodies of the monkeys (with arrows). And"
7810,SECTION LXXIII.,"fired with wrath, that (hero) rejoicing the Rākshasas with a single"
7811,SECTION LXXIII.,shaft pierced nine and seven monkeys in that encounter. And that
7812,SECTION LXXIII.,invincible hero in that conflict mangled the monkeys with shafts
7813,SECTION LXXIII.,"resembling the Sun, decked with gold. And their persons pierced in that"
7814,SECTION LXXIII.,"contest, and themselves pained with those arrows, they began to fall"
7815,SECTION LXXIII.,"down, giving up all intention of fight, like mighty Asuras smit by the"
7816,SECTION LXXIII.,"celestials. And then waxing highly enraged, those considerable monkeys"
7817,SECTION LXXIII.,in that conflict hotly pursued (Indrajit) resembling the Sun himself and
7818,SECTION LXXIII.,"having terrific arrows for his rays. And all the monkeys, with their"
7819,SECTION LXXIII.,"bodies riven and deprived of their senses, and bathed in blood and"
7820,SECTION LXXIII.,"writhing in torments,—pursued (Indrajit). And putting forth their"
7821,SECTION LXXIII.,"prowess in behalf of Rāma, those monkeys, equipped with rocks in the"
7822,SECTION LXXIII.,"encounter, who had set apart their very lives (for him), paused,"
7823,SECTION LXXIII.,shouting up loudly. And they in that conflict showered trees and crags
7824,SECTION LXXIII.,and mountain-tops on Rāvana’s son. And that destroyer of foes—the
7825,SECTION LXXIII.,exceedingly energetic son unto Rāvana—resisted that mighty shower of
7826,SECTION LXXIII.,trees and stones capable of compassing destruction. Then that Lord
7827,SECTION LXXIII.,pierced the monkey-hosts in the encounter with shafts resembling fire or
7828,SECTION LXXIII.,venomous serpents. And piercing Gandhamādana with eight and ten sharp
7829,SECTION LXXIII.,"arrows, he wounded Nila stationed at a distance with nine shafts. And"
7830,SECTION LXXIII.,that one endowed with redoubtable prowess pierced Mainda with seven
7831,SECTION LXXIII.,shafts capable of piercing into the pith; and he pierced Gaja with five
7832,SECTION LXXIII.,shafts in the encounter. And he pierced Jāmbavān with ten and Nila with
7833,SECTION LXXIII.,"thirty. And then with dreadful sharp shafts obtained as boons, he"
7834,SECTION LXXIII.,rendered Sugriva and Rishabha and Angada and Dwivida (almost) lifeless.
7835,SECTION LXXIII.,"And transported with passion, and resembling the Five arisen at"
7836,SECTION LXXIII.,"Doomsday, Indrajit, harassed other principal monkeys with countless"
7837,SECTION LXXIII.,"arrows. And in that terrific conflict, he agitated the monkey-hosts with"
7838,SECTION LXXIII.,"swift-speeding shafts, resembling the Sun himself, deftly discharged"
7839,SECTION LXXIII.,"(from his bow). Then in that encounter, leaving his army, Indrajit"
7840,SECTION LXXIII.,"became suddenly invisible unto the monkey-hosts,—and began to shower"
7841,SECTION LXXIII.,"fierce arrows, like dark clouds pouring rain. And with their persons"
7842,SECTION LXXIII.,"torn by the arrows of the conqueror of Sakra,—slain by his power of"
7843,SECTION LXXIII.,"illusion,—with their teeth uprooted, those mountain-like monkeys fell"
7844,SECTION LXXIII.,"down in the field, emitting frightful cries,—like a mountain smit with"
7845,SECTION LXXIII.,Indra’s thunderbolt. And in the conflict they could only see sharp
7846,SECTION LXXIII.,pointed shafts among the monkey-ranks; but that foe of the celestial
7847,SECTION LXXIII.,"chief—the Rākshasa, hidden by virtue of illusion, they could not"
7848,SECTION LXXIII.,discover there. And then the high-souled lord of Rakshas covered all
7849,SECTION LXXIII.,sides with sharp-pointed shafts resembling the rays of the Sun; and he
7850,SECTION LXXIII.,rived the foremost monkeys. And whirling darts and _nistraiças_ and
7851,SECTION LXXIII.,"axes, flaming and having the effulgence of Fire,—and furnished with"
7852,SECTION LXXIII.,"flames shooting forth sparks,—he discharged them furiously at the forces"
7853,SECTION LXXIII.,of the sovereign of monkeys. And the monkey-leaders struck with
7854,SECTION LXXIII.,"Sakrajit’s shafts resembling flames, appeared like laughing Kinçukas."
7855,SECTION LXXIII.,And some looking at the sky were struck at their eyes. And they
7856,SECTION LXXIII.,gradually began to hide themselves in each other and drop to the earth.
7857,SECTION LXXIII.,And that foremost of Rākshasas—Indrajit—with _prāças_ and darts and
7858,SECTION LXXIII.,"whetted arrows, inspired with _mantras_, pierced all those powerful"
7859,SECTION LXXIII.,"monkeys,—Hanumān and Sugriva and Angada and Gandhamādana and Jāmbavān"
7860,SECTION LXXIII.,"and Sushena and Vegadarçin, and Mainda and Dwivida and Nila and Gavāksha"
7861,SECTION LXXIII.,and Gavaya and Kesari and Hariloman and the monkey Vidyutdanshtra and
7862,SECTION LXXIII.,Suryyānana and Jyotimukha and the monkey Dadhimukha and Pāvakāksha and
7863,SECTION LXXIII.,Nala and the monkey Kumuda. And having pierced those foremost monkeys
7864,SECTION LXXIII.,"with golden-hued maces, he showered on Rāma and Lakshmana arrows"
7865,SECTION LXXIII.,resembling the rays of the Sun. And showered with those vollies of
7866,SECTION LXXIII.,"arrows, Rāma, without heeding that discharge resembling a very"
7867,SECTION LXXIII.,"downpour,—reflecting, spoke unto Lakshmana,—""O Lakshmana, this lord of"
7868,SECTION LXXIII.,"Rākshasas, this foe of the lord of celestials, having obtained the"
7869,SECTION LXXIII.,"Brāhma weapon,—after having brought down the monkey-hosts, are assailing"
7870,SECTION LXXIII.,"us with sharpened shafts. And that high-souled heedful one, having been"
7871,SECTION LXXIII.,"given a boon by the Self-sprung, hath rendered his dreadful body"
7872,SECTION LXXIII.,"invisible. How can we slay him, who is fighting with upraised weapons,"
7873,SECTION LXXIII.,"but who hath hid his body. The reverend Self-sprung, I deem, is"
7874,SECTION LXXIII.,"incomprehensible. And this is his weapon, embodying his energy."
7875,SECTION LXXIII.,"Therefore, O intelligent one, do thou to-day along with me calmly bear"
7876,SECTION LXXIII.,this. And let this foremost them all—this lord of Rākshasas—cover all
7877,SECTION LXXIII.,"sides with the showers of his shafts. And in consequence of this, the"
7878,SECTION LXXIII.,"army of the monkey-king with its greatest heroes fallen, doth not appear"
7879,SECTION LXXIII.,"to advantage. And seeing us also fallen senseless, and desisting from"

7882,SECTION LXXIII.,"assailed by Indra with networks of arrows, they were then sore"
7883,SECTION LXXIII.,"distressed the field. And having struck them with sadness, Indra from"
7884,SECTION LXXIII.,joy shouted in the encounter. And having thus worst in battle that

7915,SECTION LXXIV.,quick-paced monkeys hath been slain by this weapon. Let us go and
7916,SECTION LXXIV.,"console them who are still living"". And those two great heroes—Hanumān"
7917,SECTION LXXIV.,"and that foremost of the Rākshasas, with fire-brands in their hands,"
7918,SECTION LXXIV.,began to range to and fro in the battle field. And they beheld there the
7919,SECTION LXXIV.,earth strewn on all sides with monkeys lying down like so many hills and
7920,SECTION LXXIV.,various shining weapons. And some of these monkeys were deprived of
7921,SECTION LXXIV.,"their tails, some of their hands, some of their thighs, some of their"
7922,SECTION LXXIV.,"legs, some of their fingers, and some of their heads. And blood was"
7923,SECTION LXXIV.,"gushing out from the persons of some, and others were urinating out of"
7924,SECTION LXXIV.,"fear. And Bibhishana and Hanumān beheld there Sugriva, Angada, Nila,"
7925,SECTION LXXIV.,"Gandhamldana, Jāmbavān, Sushena, Vegadarshin, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha,"
7926,SECTION LXXIV.,"and the monkey, Dwivida,—almost slain. And Bibhishana and Hanumān saw in"

7933,SECTION LXXIV.,"son said,—""O noble one, hath not thy life been destroyed with those"
7934,SECTION LXXIV.,"sharp shafts?"" Hearing Bibhishana’s words, Jāmbavān—best of"
7935,SECTION LXXIV.,"bears—evoking utterance with extreme effort, said,—""O foremost of"
7936,SECTION LXXIV.,"Nairitas, endowed with exceeding prowess, I know thee by thy voice."
7937,SECTION LXXIV.,"Having my person pierced with sharp shafts, I cannot see thee with my"
7938,SECTION LXXIV.,eyes. Doth he through whom Anjanā as well as Mātariçwa²⁷³ are blessed
7939,SECTION LXXIV.,"with fair offspring,—doth that prince of monkeys—Hanumān—live?"" Hearing"
7940,SECTION LXXIV.,"Jāmbavān’s speech, Bibhishaua said,—""Why, passing by the son of the high"
7941,SECTION LXXIV.,"and mighty,²⁷⁴ dost thou enquire after the Wind-god’s offspring? O noble"
7942,SECTION LXXIV.,"one, thou dost not show that overflowing affection either for king"
7943,SECTION LXXIV.,"Sugriva or Rāghava that thou showest for the son of the Wind-god""."
7944,SECTION LXXIV.,"Hearing Bibhishana’s words, Jāmbavān said,—""Hear, O foremost of"
7945,SECTION LXXIV.,"Rākshasas, why I enquire after the Wind-god’s son. While this hero is"
7946,SECTION LXXIV.,"alive, this force, albeit destroyed, liveth; but if Hanumān is reft of"
7947,SECTION LXXIV.,"life, although living, we are destroyed. O child, if the Wind-god’s"
7948,SECTION LXXIV.,"offspring, resembling his sire himself or (the deity of) Fire in"
7949,SECTION LXXIV.,"prowess, is alive, there is hope for our lives"". Then approaching that"
7950,SECTION LXXIV.,"aged one, Hanumān—son unto the Wind god—saluted him humbly, holding"
7951,SECTION LXXIV.,"Jāmbavān’s feet. Hearing Hanumān’s voice, that foremost of monkeys, with"
7952,SECTION LXXIV.,"his senses sorely smarting, deemed himself as having regained his life."
7953,SECTION LXXIV.,"Then that exceedingly energetic one addressed Hanumān, saying,—""Come, O"
7954,SECTION LXXIV.,powerful monkey. It behoveth thee to rescue the monkeys. There is none
7955,SECTION LXXIV.,"else. Endowed with profuse prowess, thou art the greatest friend of"
7956,SECTION LXXIV.,these. This is the hour when thou shouldst display thy might. Any other
7957,SECTION LXXIV.,see I not. Do thou cheer up this host consisting of bears and monkeys;
7958,SECTION LXXIV.,and do thou also heal the wounds of these two tormented by them.
7959,SECTION LXXIV.,"Bounding sheer over the main, thou, O Hanumān, shouldst repair to the"
7960,SECTION LXXIV.,Himavān—foremost of mountains. There thou wilt see that best of
7961,SECTION LXXIV.,"mountains—the golden Rishabha of terrific aspect, and, smiter of foes,"
7962,SECTION LXXIV.,"the peak also of Kailāça. Lying in the Up of these two, thou, O hero, O"
7963,SECTION LXXIV.,"powerful monkey, wilt see the mountain of medicines, fraught with"
7964,SECTION LXXIV.,healing herbs of all kinds. On its summit thou wilt find four medicinal
7965,SECTION LXXIV.,"herbs flaming and illumining the ten cardinal quarters—_viz_.,"
7966,SECTION LXXIV.,"Mritasanjivani,²⁷⁵ Viçalyakarani,²⁷⁶ Suvarnakarani,²⁷⁷ and the mighty"
7967,SECTION LXXIV.,"medicine, Sandhāni. O Hanumān, providing thyself with these, thou"
7968,SECTION LXXIV.,"shouldst come hither without delay. Do thou, O offspring of the"
7969,SECTION LXXIV.,"Wind-god²⁷⁸ bringing back lives unto these monkeys, cheer them up""."
7970,SECTION LXXIV.,"Thereat Hanumān filled himself with energy, even as the Ocean heaveth"
7971,SECTION LXXIV.,with the force of the winds (blowing on its breast). And ascending the
7972,SECTION LXXIV.,"summit of that mountain,²⁷⁹ and hurting it with his tread, that"
7973,SECTION LXXIV.,"hero—Hanumān—appeared like a second mountain, And crushed under the"
7974,SECTION LXXIV.,"tread of that monkey, the mountain was dispirited; and sore distressed,"
7975,SECTION LXXIV.,it could hardly contain itself. And the trees on it began to topple to
7976,SECTION LXXIV.,"the earth; and on account of the vehemence of the monkey, they flamed"
7977,SECTION LXXIV.,"up. And smitten by Hanumān, its peaks were scattered around. And monkeys"
7978,SECTION LXXIV.,"could no longer dwell on that foremost of mountains, which, being hard"
7979,SECTION LXXIV.,"pressed (by Hanumān), was trembling all over, with its slopes covered"
7980,SECTION LXXIV.,"with broken trees and rocks. And with her giant gateways shaking, and"
7981,SECTION LXXIV.,"the doors of her edifices broken, that night Lankā, overwhelmed with"
7982,SECTION LXXIV.,"fright, seemed to be dancing. And the offspring of the Wind-god,"
7983,SECTION LXXIV.,"resembling a mountain itself, bringing that mountain to sore straits,"
7984,SECTION LXXIV.,agitated the entire earth with her Oceans. And hurting the mountain with
7985,SECTION LXXIV.,"his tread, he, opening wide his mouth resembling that of a mare, sent up"
7986,SECTION LXXIV.,"loud shouts, terrifying the night-rangers. And hearing those tremendous"
7987,SECTION LXXIV.,"roars as he kept emitting cries, the powerful Rākshasas were quite"
7988,SECTION LXXIV.,"stupified. And bowing down unto the Ocean, that subduer of enemies, the"
7989,SECTION LXXIV.,"Wind-god’s son, endowed with dreadful prowess, began to ponder over the"
7990,SECTION LXXIV.,mighty mission with which he had been entrusted in the interests of
7991,SECTION LXXIV.,"Rāghava.—And, then upraising his tail resembling a serpent, bending his"
7992,SECTION LXXIV.,"back, contracting his ears, and opening his mouth looking like that of a"
7993,SECTION LXXIV.,"mare, that one possessed of terrific impetuosity, bounded into the sky."
7994,SECTION LXXIV.,"And with the vehemence of his rush,—he carried away in his wake whole"
7995,SECTION LXXIV.,"tracts of trees, and rocks, and crags, and inferior monkeys;²⁸⁰ and"
7996,SECTION LXXIV.,after having been carried away some distance by the vehemence of his
7997,SECTION LXXIV.,"arms and thighs, they, at length losing their velocity, fell into the"
7998,SECTION LXXIV.,"waters (of the Ocean.) And stretching his arms resembling serpents, the"
7999,SECTION LXXIV.,son of the Wind-god endowed with the prowess of Gāruda²⁸¹ coursed on
8000,SECTION LXXIV.,"towards the monarch of mountains, as if making all the quarters tremble."
8001,SECTION LXXIV.,"And seeing the sea with its hosts of billows rolling furiously, and with"
8002,SECTION LXXIV.,"the confederacies of aquatic animals bewildered by the angry waters, he"
8003,SECTION LXXIV.,"coursed on rapidly, like the discus discharged by the hand of Vishnu."
8004,SECTION LXXIV.,And surveying hills and birds and pools and rivers and tanks and
8005,SECTION LXXIV.,"splendid cities and flourishing provinces, that one equal to his sire"
8006,SECTION LXXIV.,"himself in celerity, held his way. And that hero—Hanumān—like unto his"
8007,SECTION LXXIV.,"father in prowess, and incapable of being fatigued, vigorously proceeded"
8008,SECTION LXXIV.,along the orbit of the Sun. And that powerful monkey possessed of the
8009,SECTION LXXIV.,"speed of the Wind itself, and having mighty impetuosity, careered,"
8010,SECTION LXXIV.,making all sides resound with his roars. And remembering Jāmbavān’s
8011,SECTION LXXIV.,"words, that redoubtable monkey, son unto the Wind-god, possessed of"
8012,SECTION LXXIV.,"terrific prowess, and resembling a mountain, suddenly saw (before him)"
8013,SECTION LXXIV.,the Himavān: furnished with countless cascades and numerous caves and
8014,SECTION LXXIV.,rivulets; with splendid summits appearing like massess of pale clouds;
8015,SECTION LXXIV.,and graced with various trees. And arriving at that lord of mighty
8016,SECTION LXXIV.,"mountains, furnished with excellent towering golden summits, he saw the"
8017,SECTION LXXIV.,"great sacred asylums (of the ascetics), inhabited by the flower of"
8018,SECTION LXXIV.,celestial saints. And he saw Brahmakoça²⁸² and Rajatālaya²⁸³ and
8019,SECTION LXXIV.,Sakrālaya²⁸⁴ and Rudraçarapramoksha²⁸⁵ and Hayānana²⁸⁶ and the flaming
8020,SECTION LXXIV.,"Brahmaçiras,²⁸⁷ and the servants of Vaivaçwata.²⁸⁸ And he saw the abode"
8021,SECTION LXXIV.,"of the Fire-god, and the abode of Vaiçravana and the effulgent"
8022,SECTION LXXIV.,"Suryyanivandhana.²⁸⁹ and the abode of Brahmā,²⁹⁰ and the bow of Sankara,"
8023,SECTION LXXIV.,"and the navel of the Earth.²⁹¹ And he saw Kailaça of terrific aspect,"
8024,SECTION LXXIV.,"and the stone²⁹² of Himavān, and that bull,²⁹³ and the golden mountain,"
8025,SECTION LXXIV.,"and that foremost of mountains furnished with all medicinal herbs,"
8026,SECTION LXXIV.,"flaming, and illuminated with every kind of medicinal plants. And"
8027,SECTION LXXIV.,"beholding that flaming mass of fire, the offspring of Vāsava’s²⁹⁴"
8028,SECTION LXXIV.,"emissary wondered. And bounding up to the lord of medicinal mountains,"
8029,SECTION LXXIV.,he fell to searching for the drugs. And that mighty monkey—the
8030,SECTION LXXIV.,"Wind-god’s son—leaving behind a thousand _yojanas_, began to range the"
8031,SECTION LXXIV.,mountain containing the divine remedies in its entrails. And those
8032,SECTION LXXIV.,"potent medicines, in that foremost of mountains, knowing (before-hand)"
8033,SECTION LXXIV.,"that one was coming seeking for them, rendered themselves invisible. And"
8034,SECTION LXXIV.,"not seeing them, the high-souled Hanumān was angered; and from wrath he"
8035,SECTION LXXIV.,"set up roars. And not brooking that, (Hanumān) with eyes resembling"
8036,SECTION LXXIV.,"glowing fire, addressed that foremost of mountains, saying,—""What is"
8037,SECTION LXXIV.,"this that thou hast decided on, that thou showest no compassion for"
8038,SECTION LXXIV.,"Rāghava? But, O lord of mountains, to-day witness thyself, overpowered"
8039,SECTION LXXIV.,"by my arms and torn in pieces!"" And (anon) on a sudden, he violently"
8040,SECTION LXXIV.,"rooted up its summit with trees and elephants and gold, and furnished"
8041,SECTION LXXIV.,"with a thousand varieties of ore,—having its tops torn and its slopes"
8042,SECTION LXXIV.,"aflame. And uprooting it, he sprang into (the bosom of the air),"
8043,SECTION LXXIV.,terrifying the worlds containing celestials and the lords thereof. And
8044,SECTION LXXIV.,"hymned by countless rangers of the air, that one endowed with the"
8045,SECTION LXXIV.,"terrific impetuosity of Gāruda himself, taking that summit furnished"
8046,SECTION LXXIV.,"with the splendour of the Sun, went along the orbit of the Sun. And near"
8047,SECTION LXXIV.,"the Sun, that Sun-like one seemed to be another Sun. And with that"
8048,SECTION LXXIV.,"mountain, the offspring of the bearer of perfumes appeared surpassingly"
8049,SECTION LXXIV.,"grand, like very Vishnu equipped with the flaming discus having a"
8050,SECTION LXXIV.,"thousand edges. And seeing him, the monkeys shouted,—and he also, seeing"
8051,SECTION LXXIV.,"then, shouted in delight. And hearing their tremendous cheers, those"
8052,SECTION LXXIV.,residing in Lankā shouted still more dreadfully. And then the
8053,SECTION LXXIV.,high-souled one dropped on that best of mountains in the midst of the
8054,SECTION LXXIV.,"monkey-forces; and, bowing down unto the principal monkeys there, he"
8055,SECTION LXXIV.,"embraced Bibhishana. And then those sons of that king of men, smelling"
8056,SECTION LXXIV.,"the perfume of that mighty medicine, were then and there healed of their"
8057,SECTION LXXIV.,wounds; and the heroic monkeys also sat up. And all the heroic monkeys
8058,SECTION LXXIV.,were instantly healed and cured; and those also that were slain (in
8059,SECTION LXXIV.,"battle), through the smell of that best of drugs, sat up, like persons"
8060,SECTION LXXIV.,risen after sleep at break of day. Ever since the monkeys and Rākshasas
8061,SECTION LXXIV.,"had begun to fight, for maintaining honor, all those Rākshasas that were"
8062,SECTION LXXIV.,"slain there by the mighty monkeys, were thrown into the sea. Then that"
8063,SECTION LXXIV.,"monkey, the offspring of the bearer of fragrance, endowed with terrific"
8064,SECTION LXXIV.,"speed, took that medicinal mountain (back) unto Himavān and again"
8065,SECTION LXXIV.,presented himself before Rāma.

8130,SECTION LXXV.,"strength and that are furnished with fleetness, taking fire-brands (in"

8132,SECTION LXXV.,"at the terrific front of Night, those foremost of monkeys marched"
8133,SECTION LXXV.,"towards Lankā, equipped with fire-brands. And charged at all points by"
8134,SECTION LXXV.,"numbers of monkeys armed with fire-brands, those fierce-eyed (Rākshasas)"

8143,SECTION LXXV.,ornaments of steeds; cords for tying elephants; burnished ornaments for

8161,SECTION LXXV.,"windows and daises raised there, embellished with rubies and lapises,"

8172,SECTION LXXV.,"and of the living flames, that night Lankā looked as if swarming with"
8173,SECTION LXXV.,"flowering Kinçukas. And with elephant-riders, and elephants, and steeds"

8182,SECTION LXXV.,"cries of the females amidst the drift of smoke, heated by the flames,"
8183,SECTION LXXV.,could be heard from an hundred Yojanas. And as Rākshasas having their
8184,SECTION LXXV.,"bodies burnt came out of houses, monkeys eager for encounter on a sudden"
8185,SECTION LXXV.,sprung upon them. And the shouts of the monkeys and the cries of the
8186,SECTION LXXV.,Rākshasas made the ten cardinal quarters and the ocean and the Earth
8187,SECTION LXXV.,resound.
8188,SECTION LXXV.,
8189,SECTION LXXV.,And on those high souled ones—both Rāma and Lakshmana—having been cured
8190,SECTION LXXV.,"of their wounds, possessing themselves in calmness, took up their"
8191,SECTION LXXV.,excellent bows. And Rāma drew that best of bows. And thereat there was
8192,SECTION LXXV.,heard a tremendous twang striking terror into the Rākshasas. And drawing
8193,SECTION LXXV.,"his redoubtable bow, Rāma appeared like the reverend enraged Bhava,"
8194,SECTION LXXV.,drawing his bow having sounds and instinct with Brahma energy. And the
8195,SECTION LXXV.,"twang of Rāma’s bow, drowning the roars of both the monkeys and the"

8197,SECTION LXXV.,cries of the Rākshasas and the rattle of Rāma’s bow—these three filled
8198,SECTION LXXV.,"the ten cardinal quarters. And with the shafts discharged from his bow,"
8199,SECTION LXXV.,the gateway of the city resembling the summit of Kailāça was crushed in
8200,SECTION LXXV.,"pieces, scattered around on the ground. And seeing Rāma’s shafts in cars"
8201,SECTION LXXV.,"and dwellings, the preparations for conflict were pushed on with great"
8202,SECTION LXXV.,"vigor. And in consequence of the foremost Rākshasas preparing for fight,"
8203,SECTION LXXV.,"and emitting roars, that night appeared like the Fatal Night itself. And"
8204,SECTION LXXV.,"the foremost monkeys were directed by the high-souled Sugriva,"
8205,SECTION LXXV.,"saying,—""Ye monkeys, do ye fight, approaching the gate lying at hand."
8206,SECTION LXXV.,"But he that flyeth from his ranks, should be slain by main force"". As"
8207,SECTION LXXV.,"the principal monkeys stationed themselves at the gate, equipped with"
8208,SECTION LXXV.,"fire brands, wrath took possession of Rāvana. And as he yawned, the wind"
8209,SECTION LXXV.,"(blowing from his mouth), filled the ten cardinal regions; and his wrath"
8210,SECTION LXXV.,resembled that appearing in the person of Rudra. And wrought up with a
8211,SECTION LXXV.,"mighty rage, he sent forth Kumbha and Nikumbha—both sons of"
8212,SECTION LXXV.,Kumbhakarna—in company with innumerable Rākshasas.—And in accordance
8213,SECTION LXXV.,"with Rāvana’s command, Yupāksha and Sonitāksha, and Prajangha, and"
8214,SECTION LXXV.,"Kampana went with Kumbhakarna’s sons. And, setting up leonine roars, he"
8215,SECTION LXXV.,"commanded all those highly powerful Rākshasas, saying,—""Do ye go this"
8216,SECTION LXXV.,"very day for battle"". Thus directed, those heroic Rākshasas, equipped"
8217,SECTION LXXV.,"with flaming weapons, went out, roaring again and again. And the"
8218,SECTION LXXV.,firmament was illuminated with the splendour of the ornaments of the
8219,SECTION LXXV.,Rākshasas and the splendour of their persons and the fire kindled by the
8220,SECTION LXXV.,monkeys. And there the light of the Moon and that of the stars and the

8222,SECTION LXXV.,beams of the Moon and the brilliance of the ornaments and the flaming
8223,SECTION LXXV.,splendour of the planets emblazoned all round the forces of the monkeys
8224,SECTION LXXV.,"and Rākshasas. And the light of half-burnt houses, again, falling on the"
8225,SECTION LXXV.,"restless ripples of the sea, made it wear an extremely beautiful aspect."
8226,SECTION LXXV.,"And those dreadful Rākshasa hosts, possessed of dreadful prowess and"
8227,SECTION LXXV.,"energy, were seen,—with ensigns and banners; excellent swords and"
8228,SECTION LXXV.,"_paracwadhas_,³⁰³ terrific steeds and cars and elephants rife with"
8229,SECTION LXXV.,"_paths_,³⁰⁴ and flaming darts and clubs and scimitars and _yrāsas_ and"
8230,SECTION LXXV.,_tomaras_ and bows; bearing blazing _prāsas_; ringing with the tinklings
8231,SECTION LXXV.,of hundreds of balls; with their arms encased in golden networks;

8234,SECTION LXXV.,extremely terrific; swarming with heroes; sending out sounds like those
8235,SECTION LXXV.,of the sea. And seeing the army of the Rākshasas incapable of being
8236,SECTION LXXV.,"coped with advance, the monkey-forces began to move and send up loud"

8238,SECTION LXXV.,"before the force of the foe, like unto insects plunging into aflame. And"
8239,SECTION LXXV.,"whirling with their arms bludgeons and _açanis_, that army of Rākshasas"
8240,SECTION LXXV.,"appeared exceedingly grand. And the monkeys, eager for encounter, darted"
8241,SECTION LXXV.,forward like maniacs; and began to despatch the night-rangers with rocks
8242,SECTION LXXV.,and trees and clenched fist. And Rākshasas possessed of dreadful prowess
8243,SECTION LXXV.,with whetted arrows swiftly cut off the heads of falling monkeys. And
8244,SECTION LXXV.,"the Rākshasas ranged there, with their ears torn with teeth, or their"
8245,SECTION LXXV.,"heads broken by blows, or their limbs crushed with the discharge of"
8246,SECTION LXXV.,crags. And in the same way other grim-visaged night-rangers slew with
8247,SECTION LXXV.,sharpened swords the foremost of monkeys on all sides. And one about to
8248,SECTION LXXV.,"slay another was himself slain by the latter; and one, about to bring"
8249,SECTION LXXV.,"another down, was himself brought down (by his adversary), and one that"
8250,SECTION LXXV.,"was railing at another, was in turn rebuked by his enemy; and one who"
8251,SECTION LXXV.,"was going to bite his foe, was himself bitten by him. And one was crying"
8252,SECTION LXXV.,"’Give,’³⁰⁵ and his adversary anon giveth; and another, again said,—’I"
8253,SECTION LXXV.,will give. Why puttest thyself to trouble? Stay.’ Thus there did they
8254,SECTION LXXV.,accost each other. And there was waged a terrific encounter between the
8255,SECTION LXXV.,"monkeys and the Rākshasas,—in which arms lay scattered about; and armour"
8256,SECTION LXXV.,and weapons strewn around; and mighty _prācas_³⁰⁶ were upraised; and
8257,SECTION LXXV.,which was fought with blows and darts and swords and _Kuntalas_.³⁰⁷ And
8258,SECTION LXXV.,in that conflict the Rākshasas slaughtered monkeys by tens and sevens.
8259,SECTION LXXV.,"And then the monkeys hemmed in the Rākshasa-forces, with their apparels"
8260,SECTION LXXV.,falling off and with their mail and standards strewn around.

8308,SECTION LXXVI.,"slain in the conflict, Sonitāksha mounted on a car, intrepidly rushed"

8316,SECTION LXXVI.,"and dreadful bow. And thereat, Sonitāksha swiftly took up his sword and"
8317,SECTION LXXVI.,"shield; and without reflecting for a moment, that vigorous one sprang"
8318,SECTION LXXVI.,"forward. And the powerful Angada, speedily bounding up, seized his"
8319,SECTION LXXVI.,enemy’s sword and holding the same with his hands shouted. And then
8320,SECTION LXXVI.,"hitting at (Akampana’s) shoulder-blade, that powerful"
8321,SECTION LXXVI.,"monkey—Angada—hewed him in twain, his blow going obliquely down like the"
8322,SECTION LXXVI.,"sacred thread. And taking that terrific sword, and shouting again and"

8324,SECTION LXXVI.,"strong and heroic Yupaksha accompanied by Prajangha,—mounted on a car,"
8325,SECTION LXXVI.,"wrathfully approached the mighty son of Vāli. And taking an iron mace,"
8326,SECTION LXXVI.,"that hero, Sonitāksha, adorned with a golden _angada_,—attaining a"

8328,SECTION LXXVI.,"powerful Prajangha, also, accompanied by Yupāksha, fired with wrath,"
8329,SECTION LXXVI.,"equipped with a mace, advanced towards the son of Vāli endowed with"
8330,SECTION LXXVI.,exceeding prowess. And placed between those two—Sonitāksha and
8331,SECTION LXXVI.,Prajangha—that foremost of monkeys appeared like the full Moon placed
8332,SECTION LXXVI.,"between the Visākhas.³¹⁶ And Mainda and Dwivida defending Angada,"
8333,SECTION LXXVI.,"remained beside him, desirous of witnessing the encounter between those"

8335,SECTION LXXVI.,"endowed with dreadful prowess, equipped with swords and shafts and"
8336,SECTION LXXVI.,"maces,—being on their guard, fell upon the monkeys. And the encounter"
8337,SECTION LXXVI.,that took place between those three lords of monkeys combined (on one
8338,SECTION LXXVI.,"side), and the three redoubtable Rakshasis (on the other), was dreadful"
8339,SECTION LXXVI.,"and capable of making people’s down stand on end. And they,³¹⁷ taking up"
8340,SECTION LXXVI.,"trees, hurled them in the conflict (against their antagonists); and the"
8341,SECTION LXXVI.,powerful Prājangha resisted all those with his swords. And (the monkeys)
8342,SECTION LXXVI.,in the contest showered rocks and trees on the cars (of their enemies)
8343,SECTION LXXVI.,and the exceedingly strong Yupāksha cut them off with vollies of arrows.
8344,SECTION LXXVI.,"And the powerful Sonitāksha, endowed with prowess, with his mace severed"
8345,SECTION LXXVI.,in the middle the trees which Dwivida and Mainda had uprooted and
8346,SECTION LXXVI.,"discharged. And summoning speed, Prājangha darted against Vāli’s son,"
8347,SECTION LXXVI.,upraising a huge scimitar capable of piercing into the vitals of trees.
8348,SECTION LXXVI.,"And seeing him approach, that lord of monkeys possessed of exceeding"
8349,SECTION LXXVI.,strength and great prowess struck him with an Açwakarna tree; and with a
8350,SECTION LXXVI.,blow smote his antagonist on his arm holding a _nistringa_. And seeing
8351,SECTION LXXVI.,"the sword resembling a mace dropped to the earth, that exceedingly"
8352,SECTION LXXVI.,mighty one clenched his fist into a blow like unto the levin; and that
8353,SECTION LXXVI.,"one, endowed with wondrous energy, smote in the forehead that foremost"
8354,SECTION LXXVI.,of monkeys possessed of redoubtable prowess. And thereat he for a moment
8355,SECTION LXXVI.,"was staggered. And then recovering his senses, the energetic and"
8356,SECTION LXXVI.,powerful son of Vāli by means of his clenched fist severed Prājangha’s
8357,SECTION LXXVI.,"head from his body. Thereat Yupāksha, seeing his uncle slain in battle,"
8358,SECTION LXXVI.,"with his eyes filled with tears, finding his shafts exhausted, swiftly"
8359,SECTION LXXVI.,"descended from his car and took a sword. And finding Yupāksha charge,"
8360,SECTION LXXVI.,"Dwivida, waxing wroth, speedily smote him on the breast; and that"
8361,SECTION LXXVI.,"powerful one also seized him. And finding his brother taken, the highly"
8362,SECTION LXXVI.,energetic Sonitāksha then dealt the mighty Dwivida a blow in the chest.
8363,SECTION LXXVI.,"And overcome by that blow, that one endowed with great strength, shook;"
8364,SECTION LXXVI.,and Dwivida seized his antagonist’s upraised mace. In the meanwhile
8365,SECTION LXXVI.,"Mainda came to the side of Dwivida. And Sonitāksha and Yupāksha,"
8366,SECTION LXXVI.,"bestirring themselves, began to vehemently and forcibly drag and pull"
8367,SECTION LXXVI.,those (two) monkeys. And Dwivida with his nail tore Sonhaksha’s face;
8368,SECTION LXXVI.,"and that powerful one violently bringing him down to the earth, pressed"
8369,SECTION LXXVI.,"him with might and main. And fired with wrath, Mainda—foremost of"
8370,SECTION LXXVI.,monkeys—grasped Yupāksha with his arms; and that one dropt down dead on
8371,SECTION LXXVI.,"the earth. And thereupon the force of the lord of the Rākshasas, having"
8372,SECTION LXXVI.,"its foremost heroes slain,—and aggrieved thereat, went to where"
8373,SECTION LXXVI.,"Kumbhakarna’s son was. And then cheering up the flying forces, that best"
8374,SECTION LXXVI.,"(of Rakshas),—the energetic Kumbha—seeing that Raksha host with its"
8375,SECTION LXXVI.,"mighty heroes slain by highly powerful monkeys crowned with success,"
8376,SECTION LXXVI.,began to perform difficult feats in the encounter. And needfully taking
8377,SECTION LXXVI.,"his bow, that first of bowmen discharged shafts resembling venomous"
8378,SECTION LXXVI.,serpents capable of piercing the body. And his excellent bow with shafts
8379,SECTION LXXVI.,shone resplendent like the very bow of Indra himself affluent with the
8380,SECTION LXXVI.,splendour of Airāvata and lightning. And then drawing his bow to its
8381,SECTION LXXVI.,"utmost bent, he hit Dwivida with a feathered shaft knobbed with gold."
8382,SECTION LXXVI.,"And suddenly wounded with it, that best of monkeys having the splendour"
8383,SECTION LXXVI.,"of Trikuta, fell down senseless to the earth, stretching his legs wide."
8384,SECTION LXXVI.,"And Mainda, seeing his brother, broken in mighty encounter, furiously"
8385,SECTION LXXVI.,"rushed forward, taking a gigantic crag; and that one possessed of great"
8386,SECTION LXXVI.,"strength, hurled it at the Rākshasa. And thereat Kumbha severed that"
8387,SECTION LXXVI.,crag with fire shafts discharged (from his bow). And then aiming other
8388,SECTION LXXVI.,"fair-headed arrows resembling venomous snakes, that exceedingly"
8389,SECTION LXXVI.,energetic one smote Dwivida’s elder brother in the chest. And struck
8390,SECTION LXXVI.,"(with those arrows), that leader of monkey-bands, Mainda, with his"
8391,SECTION LXXVI.,"marrow pierced therewith, fell down to the earth, deprived of his"
8392,SECTION LXXVI.,"senses. And Angada seeing his uncles³¹⁸ endowed with exceeding prowess,"
8393,SECTION LXXVI.,"overpowered, darted vehemently at Kumbha staying with bow upraised. And"
8394,SECTION LXXVI.,"as he descended, Kumbha pierced him with fire shafts; and as one"
8395,SECTION LXXVI.,"pierceth an elephant with _tomaras_, he also pierced (Angada) with three"
8396,SECTION LXXVI.,other arrows. And the powerful Kumbha pierced Angada with a great many
8397,SECTION LXXVI.,"arrows, sharp-pointed, whetted, keen and ornamented with gold. And"
8398,SECTION LXXVI.,"Vāli’s son Angada, albeit pierced all over in his person, did not shake;"
8399,SECTION LXXVI.,and he kept showering on his³¹⁹ head stones and trees. And the graceful
8400,SECTION LXXVI.,son of Kumbhakarna cut off and cleft all those (stone and trees)
8401,SECTION LXXVI.,"discharged by Vāli’s son. And seeing him spring up, Kumbha pierced that"
8402,SECTION LXXVI.,"monkey-leader on the ground with shafts, even as one assaileth an"
8403,SECTION LXXVI.,elephant with fire-brands. And blood gushed out of his closed eyes. And
8404,SECTION LXXVI.,"then covering his eyes with his hand, Angada with another took a _sāla_"
8405,SECTION LXXVI.,that was hard by. And placing on his breast the _sāla_ furnished with
8406,SECTION LXXVI.,"shoulders, and pulling its branches and bending its top, he cleared it"
8407,SECTION LXXVI.,"of its foliage, in that mighty encounter. And then in the sight of all"
8408,SECTION LXXVI.,the Rakshas he violently discharged that tree resembling the very banner
8409,SECTION LXXVI.,of Indra and appearing like Mandara itself. And thereat he³²⁰ severed it
8410,SECTION LXXVI.,with seven sharp shafts capable of piercing the body. And Angada
8411,SECTION LXXVI.,experienced a sharp pang and fell down deprived of his senses. And
8412,SECTION LXXVI.,"seeing the invincible Angada down like ebbing sea, the foremost monkeys"
8413,SECTION LXXVI.,"informed Rāghava of it. And Rāma, hearing that Vāli’s son had come to"
8414,SECTION LXXVI.,"grief in terrific fight, directed the principal monkeys, headed by"
8415,SECTION LXXVI.,"Jāmbavān. And hearing Rāma’s command, the monkeys, fired with wrath,"
8416,SECTION LXXVI.,"charged Kumbha, staying with his bow upraised. And those powerful"
8417,SECTION LXXVI.,"monkeys, with their eyes crimsoned with choler and bearing rocks and"
8418,SECTION LXXVI.,"trees in their hands, were engaged in defending Angada. And Jāmbavān and"
8419,SECTION LXXVI.,"Sushena and the monkey, Vegadarçi, wrought with wrath, darted against"
8420,SECTION LXXVI.,that hero—son unto Kumbhakarna. And seeing them spring forward; he
8421,SECTION LXXVI.,"covered up those exceedingly mighty lords of monkey, with showers of"
8422,SECTION LXXVI.,"shafts, even as a crag obstructeth the course of a current. And even the"
8423,SECTION LXXVI.,"great deep cannot see his own shores, those high-souled lord of monkeys,"
8424,SECTION LXXVI.,"coining within the range of his arrows, could not even see. And seeing"
8425,SECTION LXXVI.,"those monkeys sore distressed by the shafts, the king of the monkeys,"
8426,SECTION LXXVI.,"Sugriva, in that conflict taking his brother’s son on his back, rushed"
8427,SECTION LXXVI.,"against the son of Kumbhakarna, even as a powerful lion rusheth at an"
8428,SECTION LXXVI.,"elephant ranging on the slopes of a mountain. And that mighty monkey,"
8429,SECTION LXXVI.,"uprooting many an _açwakarna_ and other mighty trees of various kinds,"
8430,SECTION LXXVI.,discharged them (at the foe). And by means of his sharp arrows the
8431,SECTION LXXVI.,graceful son of Kumbhakarna cut off that down-pour of trees covering the
8432,SECTION LXXVI.,welkin; and incapable of being resisted. And being baffled those trees
8433,SECTION LXXVI.,looked like _çataghnis_. And seeing that shower of trees riven by
8434,SECTION LXXVI.,"Kumbha, the graceful lord of the monkeys endowed with exceeding strength"
8435,SECTION LXXVI.,"and prowess, did not feel any mortification. And suddenly attacked, he"
8436,SECTION LXXVI.,"bearing those arrows, seized Kumbha’s bow resembling in resplendence the"
8437,SECTION LXXVI.,very bow of Indra. And swiftly bounding up and performing that feat
8438,SECTION LXXVI.,"difficult of being achieved, he, exceedingly enraged, addressed Kumbha"
8439,SECTION LXXVI.,"resembling an elephant shorn of his tusks, saying,—""O elder brother of"
8440,SECTION LXXVI.,"Nikumbha, marvellous are thy might and the force of thyself as well as"
8441,SECTION LXXVI.,"the modesty and prowess that are thine and Rāvana’s. And, O thou equal"
8442,SECTION LXXVI.,unto Prahrada or Vāli or the slayer of Vritra or Varuna or Kuvera! thou
8443,SECTION LXXVI.,alone walkest in the wake of thy yet mightier father. As mental anguish
8444,SECTION LXXVI.,"doth not dog one that hath controlled his senses,—the celestials cannot"
8445,SECTION LXXVI.,"cope in conflict with thee alone, O repressor of foes, O of mighty arms,"
8446,SECTION LXXVI.,"bearing thy dart in thy hand. O thou of high intelligence, put forth thy"
8447,SECTION LXXVI.,prowess! and do thou also witness my work. It is only by virtue of the
8448,SECTION LXXVI.,"boon he hath received, that thy uncle can bear the deities and the"
8449,SECTION LXXVI.,Dānavas. But Kumbhakarna copeth with the immortals and Asuras by means
8450,SECTION LXXVI.,of his native might. And in the bow equal to Indrajit himself and in
8451,SECTION LXXVI.,"power equal to Rāvana, thou now in might and energy art the foremost of"
8452,SECTION LXXVI.,Rākshasas. And to-day let all creatures witness the mighty and wonderful
8453,SECTION LXXVI.,"encounter in conflict between thee and me, like unto the meeting of"
8454,SECTION LXXVI.,Sakra and Samvara. And unparalleled is the feat thou hast performed; and
8455,SECTION LXXVI.,thou hast displayed thy skill in weapons. And heroic monkeys endowed
8456,SECTION LXXVI.,"with dreadful vigor, have been brought down by thee. And, O hero it is"
8457,SECTION LXXVI.,only because of the apprehension³²¹ of censure of the people that I do
8458,SECTION LXXVI.,not slay thee who art fatigued in consequence of the acts that thou hast
8459,SECTION LXXVI.,"performed. And reposing from fight, do thou see my strength!"" And being"
8460,SECTION LXXVI.,"thus honored (by Sugriva) with fair speech, (Kumbha) flamed up like a"
8461,SECTION LXXVI.,flame into which oblations have been poured. And then Kumbha seized
8462,SECTION LXXVI.,"Sugriva by the arms. And like two elephants in rut, they sighing"
8463,SECTION LXXVI.,"momentarily, fastened on each other’s person, and possessed each"
8464,SECTION LXXVI.,"other,—and from fatigue emitting from their mouth flames mixed with"
8465,SECTION LXXVI.,"vapour And with the stamping of their feet, the earth was rent into"
8466,SECTION LXXVI.,"rivers, and the main was waxed, with its billows surging furiously. Then"
8467,SECTION LXXVI.,"Sugriva lifting up Kumbha clean, violently plunged him into the salt"
8468,SECTION LXXVI.,"wash, making his eyes acquainted with the locality of the deep. And in"
8469,SECTION LXXVI.,"consequence of Kumbha’s plunge, the waters heaving up, rolled on all"
8470,SECTION LXXVI.,"sides like the Vindhya or Mandara. Then springing up, and bringing"
8471,SECTION LXXVI.,"Sugriva down, Kumbha, transported with wrath dealt a blow on his chest,"
8472,SECTION LXXVI.,"like unto the levin. And thereat his skin was rent, and blood began to"
8473,SECTION LXXVI.,"gush out,—and the impetus of that blow broke Sugriva’s bones. And the"
8474,SECTION LXXVI.,vehemence (of the blow) caused a great fire to blaze up at that spot;
8475,SECTION LXXVI.,"even as the thunder-bolt smiting the mountain Meru, maketh place blazed."
8476,SECTION LXXVI.,"And the mighty Sugriva—foremost of monkeys—sorely handled by him,"
8477,SECTION LXXVI.,"fastened his fingers into a box resembling the thunder-bolt, and"
8478,SECTION LXXVI.,furnished with all the effulgence of the solar disc having a thousand
8479,SECTION LXXVI.,rays. And then that powerful one made that blow descend right on
8480,SECTION LXXVI.,"Kumbha’s breast. And agonised with that stroke, Kumbha reft of his"
8481,SECTION LXXVI.,"senses, dropped like unto a fire that hath lost its brightness. And"
8482,SECTION LXXVI.,"overpowered by that blow, the Rākshasa anon dropped down, like unto the"
8483,SECTION LXXVI.,bright Lohitānga dropping from the firmament urged on by Destiny. And
8484,SECTION LXXVI.,"the aspect of the falling Kumbha with his breast broken by the blow,"
8485,SECTION LXXVI.,"appeared like that of the Sun routed by Rudra. And on his being slain,"
8486,SECTION LXXVI.,"in encounter, by the foremost of monkeys endowed with terrific strength,"
8487,SECTION LXXVI.,"the earth with her hills and woods, shook; and a mighty fear took"

8540,SECTION LXXVII.,"excellent city³²⁵ of the Gandharbas, and the planets, stars and the"

8546,SECTION LXXVII.,powerful (Nikumbha) having long-arms³²⁶ threw his _parigha_ resembling

8549,SECTION LXXVII.,"broken portions, being scattered, appeared like hundreds of fire-brands"
8550,SECTION LXXVII.,in the sky. Like unto a mountain standing still even at the time of an
8551,SECTION LXXVII.,earthquake that mighty monkey was not moved albeit struck with the
8552,SECTION LXXVII.,"_parigha_. Being thus hurt that highly powerful Hanumān, the foremost of"
8553,SECTION LXXVII.,"the monkeys, with great velocity clenched his fist. And with this, the"
8554,SECTION LXXVII.,"powerful (monkey) gifted with great impetuosity, and resembling the wind"
8555,SECTION LXXVII.,"in prowess, struck Nikumbha on his breast. And with that fist, his"
8556,SECTION LXXVII.,(Nikumbha’s) armour³²⁷ was riven and blood gushed out. And a light
8557,SECTION LXXVII.,rising out of his breast suddenly disappeared like unto lightning
8558,SECTION LXXVII.,disappearing in a mass of clouds. And being struck with his (Hanumān’s)
8559,SECTION LXXVII.,fist Nikumbha was greatly moved and restoring himself attacked the
8560,SECTION LXXVII.,mighty Hanumān and pulled him up. And beholding in conflict the terrible
8561,SECTION LXXVII.,"and powerful Hanumān pulled up by Nikumbha, the residents of Lankā began"
8562,SECTION LXXVII.,"to shout with joy. Being thus put to shame by that Raksha, Hanumān the"
8563,SECTION LXXVII.,"son of the Wind, struck him with his iron fist. And releasing himself"
8564,SECTION LXXVII.,"from the grasp of Nikumbha, Hanumān the Wind-god’s son instantly planted"
8565,SECTION LXXVII.,"his foot on the earth. Inflamed with ire, he, throwing down Nikumbha,"
8566,SECTION LXXVII.,"began to crush him; and gifted with vehemence, he, with great"
8567,SECTION LXXVII.,"impetuosity, leaped up and sat on the breast (of the Raksha). And"
8568,SECTION LXXVII.,"holding his head with two hands, he, emitting loud roars, displaced his"
8569,SECTION LXXVII.,"head. Nikumbha being thus slain in conflict by the Wind-god’s son, there"
8570,SECTION LXXVII.,ensued a terrible conflict between the highly enraged armies of the son
8571,SECTION LXXVII.,of Daçaratha and the lord of Rākshasas. And Nikumbha being deprived of
8572,SECTION LXXVII.,"his life, the monkeys began to shout—as if resounding all the quarters."
8573,SECTION LXXVII.,And with it the whole earth moved and the abode of the celestials
8574,SECTION LXXVII.,dropped down. And the Rākshasa-hosts were greatly terrified.

8657,SECTION LXXIX.,"forest of Dandaka. Remembering thy action and finding thee before, my"

8665,SECTION LXXIX.,"battlefield. Either with weapon or with clubs, in whatever thou art"
8666,SECTION LXXIX.,"expert, do thou fight with me in the battle-field, O Rāma"". Hearing the"
8667,SECTION LXXIX.,"words of Makarāksha, Rāma, Daçaratha’s son, smiling, replied to the"
8668,SECTION LXXIX.,"words of the babbler. ""O Raksha, what is the use of idle prating? None"
8669,SECTION LXXIX.,can achieve success in battle with idle words—but with fighting. I slew
8670,SECTION LXXIX.,"in the forest of Dandaka thy father with fourteen thousand Rākshasas,"

8673,SECTION LXXIX.,"shall be satisfied.³³¹ Being thus addressed by Rāghava, the mighty"
8674,SECTION LXXIX.,"Makarāksha, began to dart sharp arrows towards him in the battle-field."
8675,SECTION LXXIX.,"And Rāma, with his shafts, sundered into several pieces, those arrows."
8676,SECTION LXXIX.,"And being thus rendered useless those arrows, feathered in gold, fell"
8677,SECTION LXXIX.,down on the earth. Then there arose a terrible conflict between the
8678,SECTION LXXIX.,Rākshasa Khara’s son and Daçaratha’s son. And there were audible in that
8679,SECTION LXXIX.,"battle-field, the outcry of the heroes and the twang of the bows"
8680,SECTION LXXIX.,"stretched by their hands, like unto the muttering of the clouds in the"
8681,SECTION LXXIX.,"sky. And to beheld that wondrous conflict, the celestials, Dānavas,"
8682,SECTION LXXIX.,"Gandharbas, Kinnaras and the mighty serpents stationed themselves in the"
8683,SECTION LXXIX.,sky. They were wounded with the arrows discharged by each other and
8684,SECTION LXXIX.,their strength was doubled. And they began to fight in that battle-field
8685,SECTION LXXIX.,one attacking and the other withstanding the attack. And in that
8686,SECTION LXXIX.,conflict the Rākshasa sundered the shafts discharged by Rāma. And
8687,SECTION LXXIX.,likewise Rāma severed into several pieces the arrows shot by the
8688,SECTION LXXIX.,Rākshasa. All the quarters were covered with arrows and nothing on earth
8689,SECTION LXXIX.,"or in the sky was visible. Thereupon being excited with ire, Rāghava of"
8690,SECTION LXXIX.,long arms sundered his (Rākshasa’s) bow in conflict and with eight
8691,SECTION LXXIX.,_Nārachas_ pierced the charioteer. And with arrows Rāma sundered the
8692,SECTION LXXIX.,chariot and killing the horses brought them down. And the night-ranger
8693,SECTION LXXIX.,Makarāksha was brought down on the earth from the chariot. He then again
8694,SECTION LXXIX.,rose up with a dart in his hand creating terror unto all creatures and
8695,SECTION LXXIX.,resembling the Fire of Dissolution in resplendence. It was a terribly

8699,SECTION LXXIX.,"And taking up that huge flaming dart, the night-ranger, being excited"
8700,SECTION LXXIX.,"with ire, hurled it at the high-souled Rāghava. And Rāghava, with four"
8701,SECTION LXXIX.,"shafts, sundered that dart, in the sky, flaming and hurled at him by the"
8702,SECTION LXXIX.,"son of Khara. And that flaming dart, feathered in gold, being splintered"
8703,SECTION LXXIX.,into several pieces by Rāma’s arrows fell down on earth like a huge
8704,SECTION LXXIX.,fire-brand. And beholding that dart baffled thus by Rāma of unwearied
8705,SECTION LXXIX.,"actions all those, stationed in the welkin began to shout, ""Well done!"
8706,SECTION LXXIX.,"Well done!!"" And beholding his dart thus sundered, the night-ranger"

8710,SECTION LXXIX.,by Kākutstha in battle. And having his heart pierced he fell down and
8711,SECTION LXXIX.,"died. And beholding Makarāksha thus slain all the Rākshasas, being"
8712,SECTION LXXIX.,"afraid of Rāma’s arrows, proceeded towards Lankā. And seeing that"

8741,SECTION LXXX.,"are?"" Being thus addressed by the lord of the Rākshasas and obeying his"
8742,SECTION LXXX.,"father’s command, Indrajit proceeded towards the sacrificial ground to"
8743,SECTION LXXX.,satisfy Fire (with oblations). There came some she-demons with crimson

8749,SECTION LXXX.,"all black, by the neck. And the fire, with oblations of _sara_, became"
8750,SECTION LXXX.,greatly blazed and devoid of smoke. And there were visible many good
8751,SECTION LXXX.,"omens indicating victory. The flame of the fire was like unto gold, and"
8752,SECTION LXXX.,moving Southwards began to receive offerings of clarified butter. And
8753,SECTION LXXX.,"thus offering oblations unto fire and unto celestials, Dānavas and"
8754,SECTION LXXX.,"Rākshasas, he ascended an excellent car and soon disappeared. It was"
8755,SECTION LXXX.,"drawn by four horses and a huge bow, set with sharp arrows, appeared"

8759,SECTION LXXX.,adorned with flags made of _vaidurja_ and was like unto the flaming
8760,SECTION LXXX.,fire. And being thus well protected with Brahmā weapons resembling the
8761,SECTION LXXX.,"Sun in brilliance, the mighty son of Rāvana became invincible. And"
8762,SECTION LXXX.,offering oblations unto Fire in accordance with demonaic incantations
8763,SECTION LXXX.,"and thus obtaining the power of hiding himself, that hero, ever"
8764,SECTION LXXX.,"victorious in battle, issued out of the city and said,—""Slaying these"

8781,SECTION LXXX.,"clouding the whole sky with smoke that effulgent one, enveloped in"

8790,SECTION LXXX.,"of Rāvana in the sky and soaked in blood those golden arrows, fell down"
8791,SECTION LXXX.,"on earth. And those two best of men, hurt with his arrows, became more"

8797,SECTION LXXX.,with those sharp-pointed and terrible arrows Rāma and Lakshmana appeared
8798,SECTION LXXX.,like blossoming _kingsukas_. Like unto the sun hidden in clouds they
8799,SECTION LXXX.,"could see neither his countenance and motion, nor his bow and arrows."
8800,SECTION LXXX.,And being wounded with those arrows hundreds of monkeys died and fell
8801,SECTION LXXX.,"down on the earth. Thereupon Lakshmana, being excited with wrath, spoke"

8804,SECTION LXXX.,"auspicious marks, saying—""It doth not behove thee to clear all the"
8805,SECTION LXXX.,Rākshasas off the earth for the folly of one individual. Thou shouldst
8806,SECTION LXXX.,"not slay him, who hath retired from battle, hath hidden himself, hath"
8807,SECTION LXXX.,"sought thy shelter, hath stood before thee with joined palms, hath fled"
8808,SECTION LXXX.,"away or who is bewildered. O thou of mighty-arms, let us try to slay him"
8809,SECTION LXXX.,(Indrajit). And to accomplish it I shall use the weapons gifted with
8810,SECTION LXXX.,great impetuosity and resembling the serpents. He is hidden from the
8811,SECTION LXXX.,public gaze so we must slay him—had he been fighting openly the leaders
8812,SECTION LXXX.,of the monkey hosts could have slain that Rākshasa. Truly he shall be
8813,SECTION LXXX.,burnt to death with my shafts and fall down on the earth albeit he

8855,SECTION LXXXI.,thought within himself—’What must be the intention of Indrajit?’ and
8856,SECTION LXXXI.,accompanied by heroic monkeys advanced towards the son of Rāvana. And
8857,SECTION LXXXI.,"beholding that monkey host, Rāvana’s son became beside himself with ire"
8858,SECTION LXXXI.,"and unsheathing his weapon _Nistrinsha_, caught her by the hair. And"
8859,SECTION LXXXI.,that Rākshasa addressed himself to strike her in the presence of all
8860,SECTION LXXXI.,"those monkeys, and that illusory figure of Sitā began to bewail saying,"
8861,SECTION LXXXI.,"""O Rāma! O Rāma!"" And seeing her thus caught by the head, Hanumān, the"
8862,SECTION LXXXI.,"son of Maruta, greatly sorry, began to shed tears. And beholding that"
8863,SECTION LXXXI.,"beloved spouse of Rāma, having a tender and beautiful person, he"
8864,SECTION LXXXI.,"addressed angrily the son of the lord of Rākshasas with harsh words. ""It"
8865,SECTION LXXXI.,"is for thy destruction, O Vicious-souled one! that thou hast touched her"
8866,SECTION LXXXI.,hair. Being descended from that great Brahmā ascetic thou art born as a
8867,SECTION LXXXI.,"Rākshasa. O! cursed art thou, since thou hast cherished such a desire"
8868,SECTION LXXXI.,and engaged in such a vicious deed. O vile! O wicked! O cruel and
8869,SECTION LXXXI.,dishonorable wight! O thou having vice for thy prowess! O shameless! Art
8870,SECTION LXXXI.,thou not ashamed of perpetrating such an inhuman deed. What hath
8871,SECTION LXXXI.,"Maithili done by thee, O cruel one! that thou art ready to slay her—She"
8872,SECTION LXXXI.,"hath been banished from her home, territory and hath been separated from"
8873,SECTION LXXXI.,"her lord. O thou worthy of being slain, destroying Sitā, thou shalt not"
8874,SECTION LXXXI.,live long as thou hast been brought under me. Thou shalt after the death
8875,SECTION LXXXI.,reach the place which is occupied by those who murder women—a place
8876,SECTION LXXXI.,which is avoided even by those who commit every sort of crime punishable
8877,SECTION LXXXI.,"by law"". Saying this Hanumān, accompanied by monkeys armed with weapons,"
8878,SECTION LXXXI.,"and excited with ire, proceeded towards the son of the lord of"
8879,SECTION LXXXI.,Rākshasas. Beholding the highly powerful monkeys advance thus the
8880,SECTION LXXXI.,"Rākshasas, inflamed with wrath, obstructed them. And assailing the"
8881,SECTION LXXXI.,"monkey-hosts with thousands of arrows, Indrajit spoke unto that foremost"
8882,SECTION LXXXI.,"of monkeys, Hanumān, saying,—""To-day I shall slay before you all"
8883,SECTION LXXXI.,"Vaidehi, for whom thou, Sugriva and Rāma have come. Slaying her, O"
8884,SECTION LXXXI.,"monkey, I shall afterwards kill thee, Rāma, Lakshmana and Sugriva and"
8885,SECTION LXXXI.,"the dishonorable Bibhisana. And, O monkey, about not destroying women,"
8886,SECTION LXXXI.,of which thou wert speaking (I might say) that we must always do what
8887,SECTION LXXXI.,"pains our enemies"".³³⁶ Saying this, Indrajit with a sharp sword, himself"
8888,SECTION LXXXI.,killed the illusory Sitā thus bewailing. And being sundered by him
8889,SECTION LXXXI.,"obliquely in a way in which a sacred thread lies on one’s own person,"
8890,SECTION LXXXI.,the innocent (Sitā) having a beautiful countenance fell down on the
8891,SECTION LXXXI.,"earth. And slaying her Indrajit spoke unto Hanumān, saying,—""Behold I"
8892,SECTION LXXXI.,have slain (before thee) with my sword Rāma’s beloved. And Vaidehi being
8893,SECTION LXXXI.,"thus slain, all your labours have been rendered useless"". And destroying"
8894,SECTION LXXXI.,"her with his own hand by means of a huge sword, Indrajit, greatly"
8895,SECTION LXXXI.,pleased ascended his car and began to emit dreadful roars. And the
8896,SECTION LXXXI.,monkeys stationed near heard that terrible roar and saw him enter the
8897,SECTION LXXXI.,castle.³³⁷ And slaying Sitā³³⁸ that wicked-minded son of Rāvana became
8898,SECTION LXXXI.,greatly pleased. And beholding him thus delighted the monkeys being
8899,SECTION LXXXI.,greatly sorry fled away.

8920,SECTION LXXXII.,"Thereupon Hanumān, the son of Maruta, spoke unto them, poorly, terrified"
8921,SECTION LXXXII.,"and of a sorrowful countenance, saying,—""O monkeys, why do ye look so"
8922,SECTION LXXXII.,melancholy and why are you flying away? Why have ye renounced your
8923,SECTION LXXXII.,earnest desire for fight? And where is your heroism gone? Do ye remain
8924,SECTION LXXXII.,"behind me, I shall go first in the battle"". Being thus addressed by that"
8925,SECTION LXXXII.,"highly intelligent son of the Wind-god, they were greatly excited with"
8926,SECTION LXXXII.,wrath and being pleased took up trees and crags in their hands. And
8927,SECTION LXXXII.,roaring thus the leading monkeys advanced towards the Rākshasas and
8928,SECTION LXXXII.,stood encircling Hanumān in the battle-field. And being surrounded on
8929,SECTION LXXXII.,"all sides by leading monkeys, Hanumān began to burn down enemy’s host"
8930,SECTION LXXXII.,like unto fire spreading its flames. And being encircled by monkey-hosts
8931,SECTION LXXXII.,that mighty monkey resembling Death himself began to grind the
8932,SECTION LXXXII.,"Rākshasas. And being overwhelmed with grief and wrought up with ire,"
8933,SECTION LXXXII.,"that monkey Hanumān, threw a huge crag on the car of that son of Rāvana."
8934,SECTION LXXXII.,"Beholding that crag about to fall down on the car, the charioteer moved"
8935,SECTION LXXXII.,his horses and it was speedily brought at some distance. And not
8936,SECTION LXXXII.,"reaching Indrajit stationed on the car and the charioteer, that crag,"
8937,SECTION LXXXII.,"uselessly hurled, fell down on the earth. And that crag falling down"
8938,SECTION LXXXII.,many of the Rākshasas were crushed. Thereupon hundreds of huge-bodied
8939,SECTION LXXXII.,"monkeys, emitting cries and taking up crags and trees proceeded towards"
8940,SECTION LXXXII.,him (Indrajit) and hurled them at him. And the monkeys gifted with
8941,SECTION LXXXII.,dreadful prowess began to make a down-pour of crags and trees. They thus
8942,SECTION LXXXII.,assailed the enemies and frequently emitted cries. And the grim-visaged
8943,SECTION LXXXII.,night-rangers were thus assailed with trees in that field by the
8944,SECTION LXXXII.,"terrible monkeys. Beholding his army thus distressed by the monkeys,"
8945,SECTION LXXXII.,"Indrajit, excited with wrath, and taking up his dart, proceeded towards"
8946,SECTION LXXXII.,"the enemies, and encircled by his soldiers showered terrible shafts upon"
8947,SECTION LXXXII.,them. And that one of dreadful prowess slew many a leading monkey by
8948,SECTION LXXXII.,"means of darts, Açanis, swords, _pattiças_ and clubs. And the highly"
8949,SECTION LXXXII.,"powerful monkeys destroyed his retinue, with crags, stones and trees"
8950,SECTION LXXXII.,having strong trunks. And Hanumān thus crushed many a Rākshasa of
8951,SECTION LXXXII.,terrible deeds. Obstructing the Rākshasas (for some time) Hanumān spoke
8952,SECTION LXXXII.,"unto monkeys, saying,—""Stay, we should not fight now. That daughter of"
8953,SECTION LXXXII.,"Janaka hath been slain, for whom we have engaged in fight, renouncing"
8954,SECTION LXXXII.,all hope of life and desiring to accomplish Rāma’s satisfaction. Let us
8955,SECTION LXXXII.,now go and inform Rāma and Sugriva of it. And we shall do as we shall be
8956,SECTION LXXXII.,commanded by them. Saying this and desisting all the monkeys from
8957,SECTION LXXXII.,encounter that foremost of monkeys proceeded undaunted and heroically.
8958,SECTION LXXXII.,And beholding Hanumān proceed thus where Rāghava was that wicked-minded
8959,SECTION LXXXII.,one (Indrajit) with a view to offer oblations unto Fire entered the
8960,SECTION LXXXII.,sacrificial altar _Nikumbhilā_. And reaching there Indrajit lighted up
8961,SECTION LXXXII.,fire and began to pour oblations therein. And the Fire blazed up
8962,SECTION LXXXII.,"receiving oblations of blood, and being satisfied assumed the appearance"
8963,SECTION LXXXII.,"of the setting sun. And Indrajit conversant with all ceremonials,"
8964,SECTION LXXXII.,offered oblations in due form for the welfare of the Rākshasas. And they
8965,SECTION LXXXII.,all stood there watching the result and desirous of ascertaining the

8978,SECTION LXXXIII.,"therefore proceed speedily, O lord of bears, with all thy soldiers to"
8979,SECTION LXXXIII.,assist that foremost of monkeys.
8980,SECTION LXXXIII.,
8981,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Thereupon, saying, ’So be it,’ that king of bears, surrounded by his"
8982,SECTION LXXXIII.,"forces, approached the Western gate, where the monkey, Hanumān, was"
8983,SECTION LXXXIII.,"stationed. And then the lord of bears saw Hanumān approach, surrounded"
8984,SECTION LXXXIII.,"by monkeys sighing hard, who had faught the fight. And seeing on the way"
8985,SECTION LXXXIII.,"that host of bears dreadful and resembling dark clouds, on the march,"
8986,SECTION LXXXIII.,Hanumān made them desist. And that illustrious one along with that
8987,SECTION LXXXIII.,"force, speedily presented himself (before Rāma), and with a heavy heart"
8988,SECTION LXXXIII.,"addressed him, saying—""As we were fighting in the field, Rāvana’s son,"
8989,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Indrajit in our very sight slew Sitā, crying (in distress). O subduer of"
8990,SECTION LXXXIII.,"enemies, seeing her (in this plight) I, with my senses bewildered, have"
8991,SECTION LXXXIII.,been overwhelmed with grief. Therefore I have come unto thee to inform
8992,SECTION LXXXIII.,"thee of what hath befallen"". Hearing these words of his, Rāghava,"
8993,SECTION LXXXIII.,"overwhelmed with grief, dropped down to the earth, like a tree whose"
8994,SECTION LXXXIII.,"roots have been severed. Seeing the god-like Rāghava down on the earth,"
8995,SECTION LXXXIII.,the foremost monkeys from all sides rushed forward and came to where (he
8996,SECTION LXXXIII.,"was). And with water scented with lotuses,³⁴⁰ they fell to sprinkling"
8997,SECTION LXXXIII.,that one resembling a furious fire³⁴¹ that hath suddenly arisen. Thereat
8998,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Lakshmana overcome with sorrow, embracing Rāma, spoke unto him words"
8999,SECTION LXXXIII.,"fraught with reason and import,—""Profitless³⁴² virtue is incapable, O"
9000,SECTION LXXXIII.,"noble one, of delivering from calamaties thee, who hast subdued thy"
9001,SECTION LXXXIII.,"senses, and who ever abidest in the good path. Beings and the mobile as"
9002,SECTION LXXXIII.,well as the immobile cannot have that direct perception of virtue which
9003,SECTION LXXXIII.,"they have of happiness. Therefore, I ween, virtue is a non-entity."
9004,SECTION LXXXIII.,Inasmuch as the mobile (albeit devoid of any regard for virtue) are
9005,SECTION LXXXIII.,"nevertheless happy, and as the mobile also are so, this virtue cannot"
9006,SECTION LXXXIII.,"lead to happiness. (If it were so), one like thee would have not been"
9007,SECTION LXXXIII.,placed in peril. If unrighteousness would bring unhappiness on
9008,SECTION LXXXIII.,"creatures, Rāvana should hence to hell, and thou possessed of virtue,"
9009,SECTION LXXXIII.,"shouldst not come by misfortune. And seeing that he is free from danger,"
9010,SECTION LXXXIII.,"and thou art in it, righteousness and its opposite are found to have"
9011,SECTION LXXXIII.,tendencies the very reverse of those assigned to them respectively (by
9012,SECTION LXXXIII.,"the Vedas). And if by means of virtue, one attaineth the felicity"
9013,SECTION LXXXIII.,"attached to it, and by means of unrighteouness, one reapeth its proper"
9014,SECTION LXXXIII.,"fruit, then let those that are unrighteous reap the fruit of their"
9015,SECTION LXXXIII.,"impiety,—nor let those that set their face against sin, be deprived of"
9016,SECTION LXXXIII.,the fruit of their righteousness; and let those that walk in the way of
9017,SECTION LXXXIII.,virtue reap the fruit of their piety. But as prosperity attendeth those
9018,SECTION LXXXIII.,"that are established in un-righteousness, and as those regardful of"
9019,SECTION LXXXIII.,"righteousness fare lamentably,—these³⁴³ have not the senses assigned to"
9020,SECTION LXXXIII.,"them (by the scriptures). If, O Rāghava, (it is contended that)"
9021,SECTION LXXXIII.,"unrighteousness cutteth off the wicked, then whom shall unrighteousness,"
9022,SECTION LXXXIII.,"himself slain by the act of slaughter of the destroyer,—slay in his"
9023,SECTION LXXXIII.,turn? Or if it is said that one is slain or slayeth another by
9024,SECTION LXXXIII.,"ordinance, then it is Destiny, which is touched by the sinful act and"
9025,SECTION LXXXIII.,"not he. O chastiser of foes, incapable of meting out"
9026,SECTION LXXXIII.,"retribution,³⁴⁴—unmanifest itself, and non-existent, how can virtue,"
9027,SECTION LXXXIII.,"even if we grant its existence, find out the person that should be"
9028,SECTION LXXXIII.,"slain? If, O foremost of the good, it had existed, thou wouldst not have"
9029,SECTION LXXXIII.,come by any misfortune. But inasmuch as thou hast fallen into this
9030,SECTION LXXXIII.,"plight, there is no such thing as virtue. Or itself feeble and impotent,"
9031,SECTION LXXXIII.,it taketh refuge in manliness. And being powerless and bereft of
9032,SECTION LXXXIII.,"dignity, it should, I deem, by no means be followed. And if virtue is a"
9033,SECTION LXXXIII.,"property of manliness, then carefully forsaking virtue, do thou follow"
9034,SECTION LXXXIII.,"strength as thou hast hitherto followed virtue. But, O subduer of"
9035,SECTION LXXXIII.,"enemies, if truthfulness be virtue, art thou not bound by that departing"
9036,SECTION LXXXIII.,"from which the king lost his life?³⁴⁵ And, O chastiser of foes, if"
9037,SECTION LXXXIII.,"virtue must be practised above all, or if prowess must have"
9038,SECTION LXXXIII.,"precedence,—then the thunder-handed Satakratu would not have celebrated"
9039,SECTION LXXXIII.,"his sacrifice, slaying the ascetic.³⁴⁶ O Rāghava, virtue aided by"
9040,SECTION LXXXIII.,"prowess, destroyeth enemies. Therefore, O Kākutstha, people, for"
9041,SECTION LXXXIII.,"compassing their ends, resort to both virtue and prowess. This, sire, is"
9042,SECTION LXXXIII.,"my opinion: this, O Rāghava, is virtue. But thou, having then renounced"
9043,SECTION LXXXIII.,"the kingdom, hast laid the axe at the root³⁴⁷ of righteousness. Like"
9044,SECTION LXXXIII.,"streams issuing out mountains, all acts spring from wealth flowing from"
9045,SECTION LXXXIII.,various regions and attaining magnitude. Like a shrunken stream in
9046,SECTION LXXXIII.,"summer, all the acts of that foolish person who hath been divorced by"
9047,SECTION LXXXIII.,"wealth, are annihilated.—He that renouncing riches within his reach,³⁴⁸"
9048,SECTION LXXXIII.,"hankers after enjoyment,—being carried away by his overmastering desire,"
9049,SECTION LXXXIII.,taketh to getting at wealth by sinful acts; and then he incurreth guilt.
9050,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Unto him that hath wealth are friends, unto him that hath wealth are"
9051,SECTION LXXXIII.,"acquaintances,—he that hath wealth is an individuality in this world,"
9052,SECTION LXXXIII.,and he that hath wealth is a learned person. He that hath wealth is
9053,SECTION LXXXIII.,powerful; he that hath wealth is intelligent; he that hath wealth is
9054,SECTION LXXXIII.,mighty-armed; and he that hath wealth is full of all graces. All these
9055,SECTION LXXXIII.,that I have ennumerated are the evils of forsaking fortune. (I cannot
9056,SECTION LXXXIII.,"divine) what made thee, renouncing the monarchy, to adopt such a"
9057,SECTION LXXXIII.,"course.—He that hath riches, hath virtue and desire attending on him,"
9058,SECTION LXXXIII.,"and hath everything auspicious. That one without wealth, that seeketh"
9059,SECTION LXXXIII.,"it, cannot secure the wealth of prowess, without riches and desire. And,"
9060,SECTION LXXXIII.,"O lord of men, cheerfulness, and desire, and pride, and piety, and"

9164,SECTION LXXXV.,"Hearing his speech, Rāghava, overwhelmed with grief, could not perfectly"
9165,SECTION LXXXV.,"comprehend what was said by the Rākshasa. Then, summoning up patience,"
9166,SECTION LXXXV.,"Rāma—captor of hostile capitals—spoke unto Bibhishana, seated near the"
9167,SECTION LXXXV.,"monkeys,—""O lord of Nairitas, I once more wish to hear what, O"
9168,SECTION LXXXV.,"Bibhishana, thou hast said"". Hearing Rāghava’s words, Bibhishana,"
9169,SECTION LXXXV.,"skilled in speech, again spoke these words, saying,—""O mighty-armed one,"
9170,SECTION LXXXV.,"I have stationed the forces, O hero, agreeably to thy directions. The"
9171,SECTION LXXXV.,entire force hath been divided around; and the leaders have also been
9172,SECTION LXXXV.,"placed properly. Further, O mighty master, listen to what I have to say."
9173,SECTION LXXXV.,"On thy having been causelessly aggrieved, we all of us were seized with"
9174,SECTION LXXXV.,"grief. If this anxiety of thine conduceth to the joy of the enemy, do"
9175,SECTION LXXXV.,"thou cast it off. And, O hero, bestir thyself,—and summon up spirits. If"
9176,SECTION LXXXV.,"thou art to have Sitā, and if the night-rangers are to be slain by thee,"
9177,SECTION LXXXV.,"do thou, O Raghu’s son, listen to my profitable speech. Let Sumitrā’s"
9178,SECTION LXXXV.,"son go forth, environed by a mighty force, for slaying in battle the son"
9179,SECTION LXXXV.,"of Rāvana, who hath gone to Nikumbhilā; with shafts resembling venomous"
9180,SECTION LXXXV.,"serpents, discharged from the round³⁵¹ of his bow. By virtue of his"
9181,SECTION LXXXV.,"austerities, that hero, from a boon conferred by the Self-sprung, hath"
9182,SECTION LXXXV.,"obtained the Brahmaçiras weapon, together with steeds coursing at their"
9183,SECTION LXXXV.,"will. Now he with his army hath gone to Nikumbhilā; and when, having"
9184,SECTION LXXXV.,"finished his rites, he gets up, know that all of us are slain. ’When not"
9185,SECTION LXXXV.,"reaching Nikumbhilā, and not having finished thy offerings unto fire,"
9186,SECTION LXXXV.,"thou, equipped with arms, art slain by a foe,—O enemy of Indra, that is"
9187,SECTION LXXXV.,"thy death.’—Thus, O mighty-armed one, did the lord of all creatures"
9188,SECTION LXXXV.,"confer a boon (on Indrajit), and, O king, thus was the death of this"
9189,SECTION LXXXV.,"intelligent one ordained. O Rāma, for compassing the destruction of"
9190,SECTION LXXXV.,"Indrajit, do thou commission a mighty force. On his being slain, know"
9191,SECTION LXXXV.,"that Rāvana along with his retainers are slain"".—Hearing Bibhishana’s"
9192,SECTION LXXXV.,"words, Rāma said,—""O thou having truth for prowess, I know the illusion"
9193,SECTION LXXXV.,"of that fierce one. Without doubt, he is skilled in the Brahma weapon,"
9194,SECTION LXXXV.,"is potent in illusion and, is possessed of exceeding strength. In"
9195,SECTION LXXXV.,"conflict, he depriveth of consciousness even the celestials with Varuna"
9196,SECTION LXXXV.,(at their head). And as that illustrious (one) goeth about in the welkin
9197,SECTION LXXXV.,"on his chariot, none, O hero, can perceive his course, like the course"
9198,SECTION LXXXV.,"of the Sun when the sky is covered with clouds"". And Rāghava, being well"
9199,SECTION LXXXV.,"acquainted with the illusive energy of his wicked-minded foe, addressed"
9200,SECTION LXXXV.,"the renowned Lakshmana, saying,—""Environed by the entire host of the"
9201,SECTION LXXXV.,"lord of monkeys,—accompanied by the leaders, O Lakshmana, headed by"
9202,SECTION LXXXV.,"Hanumān,—with Jāmbavān~king of bears—and girt round by the forces,—do"
9203,SECTION LXXXV.,"thou slay this son of the Rākshasa, possessed of the strength of"
9204,SECTION LXXXV.,"illusion. And accompanied by his counsellors, this high-souled"
9205,SECTION LXXXV.,"night-ranger shall follow at thy back, in this engagement with that one"
9206,SECTION LXXXV.,"skilled in illusion"". Hearing Rāghava’s words, Lakshmana endowed with"
9207,SECTION LXXXV.,"dreadful prowess, with Bibhishana,—took up another excellent bow. And"
9208,SECTION LXXXV.,"donning on his mail, and putting on his armour and his sword, and"
9209,SECTION LXXXV.,"furnished with arrows, and a bow in his left hand,—Sumitrā’s son,"
9210,SECTION LXXXV.,"touching Rāma’s feet, feeling elated, addressed Rāma, saying,—""To-day"
9211,SECTION LXXXV.,"the shafts discharged from my bow, piercing Rāvana’s son, shall fall"
9212,SECTION LXXXV.,"into Lankā, even as swans drop into a tank. This very day shall my"
9213,SECTION LXXXV.,"arrows, shot from my redoubtable bow-string, rive the body of that"
9214,SECTION LXXXV.,"terrific one"". Having spoken thus, the effulgent Lakshmana, eager to"
9215,SECTION LXXXV.,"slay Rāvana’s son, went before his brother. And having saluted at the"
9216,SECTION LXXXV.,"feet of his superior and went round him, Lakshmana set out for the"
9217,SECTION LXXXV.,"sacrificial ground (named) Nikumbhilā, protected by the son of Rāvana."
9218,SECTION LXXXV.,"And accompanied by Bibhishana, that powerful son of the"
9219,SECTION LXXXV.,king—Lakshmana—after his brother had offered up prayers in his
9220,SECTION LXXXV.,"behalf,—set off with all speed. And surrounded by thousands of monkeys,"
9221,SECTION LXXXV.,Hanumān as well as Bibhishana together with his counsellors—speedily
9222,SECTION LXXXV.,went in the wake of Lakshmana. And strongly encompassed by that mighty
9223,SECTION LXXXV.,"monkey-host, (Lakshmana) saw the forces of the bear-king stationed on"
9224,SECTION LXXXV.,"the way. And having proceeded far, Sumitrā’s son—enhancer of the delight"
9225,SECTION LXXXV.,of friends—from a distance discovered the forces of the
9226,SECTION LXXXV.,"Rākshasa-monarch, drawn up in battle-array. And that subduer of"
9227,SECTION LXXXV.,"enemies—Raghu’s son—bearing his bow in his hand, coming upon him whoso"
9228,SECTION LXXXV.,"martial might lay in illusion,—stopped (there) for conquering his foe"
9229,SECTION LXXXV.,"agreeably to the ordinance³⁵² of Brahmā. And accompanied by Bibhislnna,"
9230,SECTION LXXXV.,"the heroic Angada, and the Wind-god’s offspring, the powerful son of the"
9231,SECTION LXXXV.,"king dived into the forces of the foe, various, blazing with burnished"
9232,SECTION LXXXV.,"arms, dense with standards; And thronging with mighty cars,³⁵³ capable"
9233,SECTION LXXXV.,"of striking terror (into the hearts of the spectators), instinct with"
9234,SECTION LXXXV.,"immeasurable energy, and resembling darkness."

9249,SECTION LXXXVI.,Lakshmana in words fraught with evil to foes and conducing to the
9250,SECTION LXXXVI.,"welfare (of his own party), saying,—""Do thou without delay bring on an"
9251,SECTION LXXXVI.,"engagement between this cloud-black Rākshasa army, which thou beholdest,"
9252,SECTION LXXXVI.,"and the monkeys having rocks for their arms. O Lakshmana, do thou exert"
9253,SECTION LXXXVI.,thyself to break through his³⁵⁴ mighty army; and when the ranks are
9254,SECTION LXXXVI.,"broken, the son of the Rākshasa-lord shall be visible. And scattering"
9255,SECTION LXXXVI.,"among the foes shafts resembling Indra’s thunder-bolt, charge him while"
9256,SECTION LXXXVI.,"he hath not yet finished this ceremony. Slay, O hero, this wicked one,"
9257,SECTION LXXXVI.,"this son of Rāvana, given to illusion, and of terrific feats,—the fear"
9258,SECTION LXXXVI.,"of all the worlds"". Hearing Bibhishana’s words, Lakshmana graced with"
9259,SECTION LXXXVI.,auspicious marks began to shower arrows on the son of the
9260,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Rākshasa-chief. And bears and monkeys, given to fighting excellently"
9261,SECTION LXXXVI.,"with trees, in a body rushed towards that army (of Rakshas) drawn up"
9262,SECTION LXXXVI.,there. And the Rākshasas (on their part) burning to slaughter the
9263,SECTION LXXXVI.,"monkey-forces, rushed in the encounter with sharpened shafts and darts"
9264,SECTION LXXXVI.,and _tomaras_. And there took place a tremendous onslaught of the
9265,SECTION LXXXVI.,monkeys and the Rākshasas. And Lankā resounded all around with that
9266,SECTION LXXXVI.,"mighty tumult; and the sky was covered with weapons of various shapes,"
9267,SECTION LXXXVI.,and whetted arrows and trees and dreadful upraised mountain-tops. And
9268,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Rākshasas having frightful faces and arms, plying their arms among the"
9269,SECTION LXXXVI.,"foremost monkeys, began to spread terror (there). And in the same way"
9270,SECTION LXXXVI.,the monkeys in the conflict fell to slaying and wounding the Rākshasas
9271,SECTION LXXXVI.,with trees and hill-tops. And great was the terror that was spread among
9272,SECTION LXXXVI.,"the warring Rākshasas by the flower of the bears and monkeys, possessed"
9273,SECTION LXXXVI.,of gigantic persons and endowed with prodigious strength.
9274,SECTION LXXXVI.,
9275,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Hearing his own army hard beset by the enemies, and drooping,—the"
9276,SECTION LXXXVI.,"unconquerable one, ere yet he had finished his rites, rose up. And"
9277,SECTION LXXXVI.,"issuing from the gloom of the trees, Rāvana’s son, fired with wrath,"
9278,SECTION LXXXVI.,"ascended his car, which had already been well yoked (with steeds). And"
9279,SECTION LXXXVI.,"accoutred in a dreadful bow and arrows,—that one resembling a mass of"
9280,SECTION LXXXVI.,"collyrium, having a red face and eyes, looked dreadful like the"
9281,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Reaper—Death. And soon as they saw him mounted on his car, that host of"
9282,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Rakshas possessed of dreadful impetuosity, eager to engage with"
9283,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Lakshmana, stood on their ground. At this time that subduer of"
9284,SECTION LXXXVI.,"enemies—Hanumān—resembling a mountain, uprooted a giant tree incapable"
9285,SECTION LXXXVI.,"of being bandied. And in that encounter, the monkey, consuming (the"
9286,SECTION LXXXVI.,"forces) like the fire risen at Doomsday, made that army of Rākshasas"
9287,SECTION LXXXVI.,"insensible with innumerable trees. And finding the Wind-god’s son,"
9288,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Hanumān, suddenly spreading devastation among the Rākshasas by"
9289,SECTION LXXXVI.,"thousands, (they) showered (shafts) on him. And approaching on all sides"
9290,SECTION LXXXVI.,"that one resembling a hill, those bearing whetted darts attacked him"
9291,SECTION LXXXVI.,"with darts; those bearing swords in their hands, with swords; those"
9292,SECTION LXXXVI.,"bearing javelins in their hands, with javelins; with _pattiças_, those"
9293,SECTION LXXXVI.,"equipped with _pattiças_; and with bludgeons, and maces and graceful"
9294,SECTION LXXXVI.,"_kuntas_; and with hundreds of _sataghnis_, and iron clubs; and with"
9295,SECTION LXXXVI.,terrific axes; and with _bhindipālas_; and with boxes like unto
9296,SECTION LXXXVI.,"thunder-bolts; and slaps resembling the _açani_. And fired with fury, he"
9297,SECTION LXXXVI.,(on his part) spread a huge havoc among them. And Indrajit saw that
9298,SECTION LXXXVI.,"foremost of monkeys, resembling a hill, the offspring of the"
9299,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Wind-god—possessing himself in calmness, while destroying his foes. And"
9300,SECTION LXXXVI.,"thereat, he³⁵⁵ addressed his charioteer, saying,—""Go where the monkey"
9301,SECTION LXXXVI.,"is. Being disregarded by the Rātkshasas, he makes havoc among us"". Thus"
9302,SECTION LXXXVI.,"accosted by him, the charioteer went where the Wind-god’s offspring was,"
9303,SECTION LXXXVI.,carrying the exceedingly invincible Indrajit seated on the car. And
9304,SECTION LXXXVI.,"rushing forward, that irrepressible one—the Rākshasa—began to shower on"
9305,SECTION LXXXVI.,the monkey’s head arrows and swords and _pattiças_ and scimitars and
9306,SECTION LXXXVI.,"axes. And bearing all those dreadful arms, the Wind-god’s offspring,"
9307,SECTION LXXXVI.,"overcome with a mighty rage said,—""O wicked-minded son of Rāvana, if"
9308,SECTION LXXXVI.,"thou art a hero, fight on. Combat with me with thy arms. If in the"
9309,SECTION LXXXVI.,"encounter, thou bearest my impetus, then, O thou of perverse sense, thou"
9310,SECTION LXXXVI.,"indeed art the foremost of Rākshasas"". Then Bibhishana pointed out unto"
9311,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Lakshmana the son of Rāvana, who with his bow upraised, was eager to"
9312,SECTION LXXXVI.,"slay Hanumān. ""This one that, mounted on his car, is eager to slay"
9313,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Hanumān, is the son of Rāvana that hath vanquished Vāsava himself (in"
9314,SECTION LXXXVI.,"battle). Do thou, O son of Sumitrā, with peerless shafts capable of"
9315,SECTION LXXXVI.,"resisting enemies,—dreadful, and competent to finish the lives (of"
9316,SECTION LXXXVI.,"foes),—slay the son of Rāvana"". Thus accosted by Bibhishana terrific"
9317,SECTION LXXXVI.,"unto foes, that high-souled one saw (Indrajit) of dreadful prowess,"
9318,SECTION LXXXVI.,"difficult to get at, and resembling a hill,—stationed on his car."
9319,SECTION LXXXVI.,

9329,SECTION LXXXVI,"Having spoken thus unto Sumitrā’s son, Bibhishana experienced delight,"
9330,SECTION LXXXVI,"and taking (Lakshmana) bearing a bow in his hand, hurriedly went off."
9331,SECTION LXXXVI,"And proceeding some way and entering the mighty wood, Bibhishana pointed"
9332,SECTION LXXXVI,out unto Lakshmana the (place of) sacrifice. And the energetic brother
9333,SECTION LXXXVI,"of Rāvana showed unto Lakshmana the Nyagrodha, dreadful to behold and"
9334,SECTION LXXXVI,"resembling a mass of sable clouds. ""Here offering presents unto the"
9335,SECTION LXXXVI,"ghosts, the powerful son of Rāvana afterwards engages in conflict. Then"
9336,SECTION LXXXVI,the Rākshasa becomes invisible to all beings; and he slayeth his enemies
9337,SECTION LXXXVI,"in battle and fastens them with excellent shafts. Do thou, ere he hath"
9338,SECTION LXXXVI,"passed beyond the Nyagrodha, with flaming arrows destroy the powerful"
9339,SECTION LXXXVI,"son of Rāvana along with his car and steeds and charioteer"". Thereupon"
9340,SECTION LXXXVI,"saying,—’So be it,’ the exceedingly energetic son of Sumitrā—that"
9341,SECTION LXXXVI,"delight of his friends—took up his post there, stretching his variegated"
9342,SECTION LXXXVI,"bow. And Rāvana’s son Indrajit, endowed with strength, mailed, and armed"
9343,SECTION LXXXVI,"with a sword, and furnished with a banner, was seen mounted on a"
9344,SECTION LXXXVI,fire-hued chariot. And the highly powerful Lakshmana addressed
9345,SECTION LXXXVI,"Pulastya’s son, never knowing defeat, saying,—""I challenge thee to the"
9346,SECTION LXXXVI,"encounter. Do thou give me battle, exerting thy utmost"". Thus addressed,"
9347,SECTION LXXXVI,"the exceedingly energetic and intelligent son of Rāvana, seeing"
9348,SECTION LXXXVI,"Bibhishana there, spoke anto him harshly, thus,—""Born and bred in this"
9349,SECTION LXXXVI,"(Rākshasa race), thou art the very brother of my father. Why, O"
9350,SECTION LXXXVI,"Rākshasa, being my uncle, dost thou range thyself against thy son? But"
9351,SECTION LXXXVI,"neither kinship, nor emity, nor race, O wicked-minded one, nor co-birth,"
9352,SECTION LXXXVI,"can, O destroyer of righteousness, avail to make thee discern thy duty."
9353,SECTION LXXXVI,"O thou of perverse understanding, thou art indeed to be pitied; as thou"
9354,SECTION LXXXVI,"art worthy of being reproached by the virtuous; since, renouncing thine"
9355,SECTION LXXXVI,"own, thou hast espoused servitude under another. Neither by thy"
9356,SECTION LXXXVI,character nor yet thy understanding dost thou perceive the mighty
9357,SECTION LXXXVI,"difference that lieth between living with one’s own kindred, and taking"
9358,SECTION LXXXVI,"refuge with the base. If one that is not our own, be furnished with"
9359,SECTION LXXXVI,"every grace, and if one’s own be void of all merit,—one’s kindred,"
9360,SECTION LXXXVI,"albeit unworthy, is preferable; and he that is not ours, is even always"
9361,SECTION LXXXVI,"such. He that, forsaking his own party, serveth that of another, is"
9362,SECTION LXXXVI,"destroyed even by the latter, when his own party is destroyed. O"
9363,SECTION LXXXVI,"night-ranger, such is this thy relentlessness, that, O Rāvana’s younger"
9364,SECTION LXXXVI,"brother, thou being a kindred, art capable of displaying thy manliness"
9365,SECTION LXXXVI,"(as no other person can do so)"". Thus addressed by his brother’s son,"
9366,SECTION LXXXVI,"Bibhishana answered,—""O Rākshasa, why dost thou speak as if in ignorance"
9367,SECTION LXXXVI,"of my character? O impious son of the Rākshasa-chief, do thou forego the"
9368,SECTION LXXXVI,roughness which thou assumest on behalf of my dignity.³⁵⁶ Albeit born in
9369,SECTION LXXXVI,"the race of Rakshas of cruel deeds, yet having regard to the first of"
9370,SECTION LXXXVI,"principles pertaining to men, my character is not that of a Rākshasa. I"
9371,SECTION LXXXVI,do not take pleasure in the terrible; nor do I revel in unrighteousness.
9372,SECTION LXXXVI,"But how can a brother, although differing from his brother in character,"
9373,SECTION LXXXVI,"be renounced by the latter?³⁵⁷ One renouncing a person, lapsing from"
9374,SECTION LXXXVI,"virtue and bent on sinful acts, attaineth happiness, even as one doth by"
9375,SECTION LXXXVI,shaking off a venomous snake from his hand. The wise have called that
9376,SECTION LXXXVI,impious one given to stealing others’ goods and violating others’
9377,SECTION LXXXVI,"wives,—as worthy of being forsaken, even like a house that is"
9378,SECTION LXXXVI,"aflame.—Robbing others’ property, outraging the wives of others, and"
9379,SECTION LXXXVI,"inspiring fear among friends,—these three vices lead to destruction. The"
9380,SECTION LXXXVI,"dreadful slaughter of sages, rebellion against all ihe gods, overweening"
9381,SECTION LXXXVI,"conceit, anger, long-continued enmity, and running amuck of"
9382,SECTION LXXXVI,"counsel,—these sins are sapping the life and fortune of my brother; and"
9383,SECTION LXXXVI,they have hidden his virtues even as clouds cover a mountain. It is on
9384,SECTION LXXXVI,"account of these vices that my brother, thy sire, hath been deserted by"
9385,SECTION LXXXVI,"me. And this city of Lankā will not be, nor thou, nor thy father. Thou"
9386,SECTION LXXXVI,"art proud, and haughty, and a boy, O Rākshasa. Thou art fettered by the"
9387,SECTION LXXXVI,noose of Fate. Do thou say unto me whatever thou likest. To-day thou
9388,SECTION LXXXVI,"hast addressed harshly me, who have fallen on evil days; but, O worst of"
9389,SECTION LXXXVI,"Rākshasas, thou canst not pass this Nyagrodha. Having smitten the"
9390,SECTION LXXXVI,"Kākutstha, thou canst not live. Fight with that man-god, Lakshmana, in"
9391,SECTION LXXXVI,"encounter. Being slain, thou shalt serve the deities in the abode of"
9392,SECTION LXXXVI,"Yama. Displaying thy own prowess, do thou spend all thy weapons and all"
9393,SECTION LXXXVI,"thy shafts. But coming within the ken of Lakshmana’s arrows, thou wilt"
9394,SECTION LXXXVI,"not to-day go hence, living, with thy forces""."
9395,SECTION LXXXVI,
9396,SECTION LXXXVI,"³⁵⁶ Or, on account of thy heroism."
9397,SECTION LXXXVI,
9398,SECTION LXXXVI,³⁵⁷ Some read _Vishamaçilana_. Then the sense would be: ’How else

9411,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"And that one endowed with terrific strength up-raised a huge, gigantic,"

9414,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"(with ornaments) and mounted on his chariot, saw him dight (with his own"

9416,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"who, mounted on Hanumān’s back, like unto the risen sun in"
9417,SECTION LXXXVIII.,splendour—accompanied Bibhishana; and he also addressed all those
9418,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"principal monkeys, saying,—""Do ye behold my prowess! To-day do ye in the"
9419,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"conflict bear my arrowy shower shot from my bow, incapable of being"
9420,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"approached, and resembling the down-pour in the sky. To-day my shafts"
9421,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"discharged from my mighty bow shall mangle your limbs, even as fire"
9422,SECTION LXXXVIII.,burneth up a heap of cotton. To-day with your persons pierced with sharp
9423,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"shafts, with darts, and javelins, and _rishtis_ and arrows, shall I"
9424,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"despatch you all to the abode of Yama. Who shall stay before me,"
9425,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"fleet-handed, creating an arrowy shower in the field, and roaring like"
9426,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"unto clouds? Formerly in a night-engagement, with my shafts resembling"
9427,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"the thunder-bolt and _vajra_, ye two along with your foremost adherents,"
9428,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"were rendered insensible and laid down on the earth by me. But, perhaps,"
9429,SECTION LXXXVIII.,thou hast forgotten it. As thou hast presented thyself for battle before
9430,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"me, fired with wrath and resembling a venomous serpent, it is evident"
9431,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"thou wilt go to the region of Yama"". Hearing the vaunt of the"
9432,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"Rākshasa-chief, Raghu’s son, inflamed with rage, with an undaunted"
9433,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"countenance, spoke unto Rāvana’s son,—""O Rākshasa, hard is the"
9434,SECTION LXXXVIII.,achievement of the task that thou hast mentioned. He that compasseth
9435,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"business by act is alone intelligent.—But thou, O wicked-minded one,"
9436,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"incompetent as thou art to bring about thy end, attaining thy arduous"
9437,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"aim by words only, deemest thyself as crowned with success. That thou"
9438,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"hadst rendered thyself invisible in the field of conflict, was the work"
9439,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"of a thief,—and not the way of a hero. Coming within the range of thy"
9440,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"shafts, I stay here,—do thou display thy prowess. What dost thou say in"
9441,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"words?"" Thus addressed, the mighty Indrajit—conquerer of"
9442,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"enemies—stretching his dreadful bow, showered sharpened shafts. And"
9443,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"discharged by him, those exceedingly impetuous arrows, resembling the"
9444,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"venom of serpents, hitting Lakshmana, fell down like unto hissing"
9445,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"snakes. And in that encounter, Rāvana’s son—Indrajit—possessed of"
9446,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"eminent impetuosity, pierced Lakshmana, graced with auspicious marks,"
9447,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"with vehement shafts. And pierced with those arrows and bathed in blood,"
9448,SECTION LXXXVIII.,the graceful Lakshmana appeared like a smokeless fire. And seeing his
9449,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"own feat, Indrajit, coming forward, and setting up a tremendous cry,"
9450,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"said,—""O son of Sumitrā, my feathered and sharp-edged shafts shot from"
9451,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"my bow, capable of destroying life, will to-day finish thee up. To-day,"
9452,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"O Lakshmana, swarms of jackals and hosts of hawks and vultures shall"
9453,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"alight on thee lying lifeless, having been slain by me. This very day"
9454,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"shall the exceedingly wicked Rāma behold thee, who art the friend of"
9455,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"Kshatriyas and devoted unto thy brother,—and who ever bearest thyself"
9456,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"ignobly,—slain by me; to-day see thee, O Sumitrā’s son, slain by me,"
9457,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"with thy armour fallen off thy person, thy bow broken, and thy head"
9458,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"severed"". As Rāvana’s son was speaking thus harshly, Lakshmana"
9459,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"conversant with the import of words, replied in a reasonable speech,"
9460,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"saying,—""Leave off thy strength of tongue, O thou of perverse sense, O"
9461,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"Rākshasa, O thou of crooked ways! Wherefore dost thou speak thus? Bring"
9462,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"all this to pass in worthy deed. Why, O Rākshasa, without doing (what"
9463,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"thou sayest), dost thou simply say it? Do the deed,—so that I may have"
9464,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"regard for thy utterances. Mark! without speaking anything harsh,"
9465,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"without censuring thee in the least, without venting any brag, shall, I,"
9466,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"O cannibal, slay thee"". Saying this, Lakshmana drawing his bow to its"
9467,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"full bent, hit at the Rākshasa’s chest five _nārāchas_—wondrous"
9468,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"impetuous arrows. And those arrows resembling flaming serpents, with"
9469,SECTION LXXXVIII.,their velocity accelerated by the feathers (with which they were
9470,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"furnished), blazed on the Nairita’s breast like the rays of the Sun. And"
9471,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"wounded with those shafts, Rāvana’s son, fired with wrath, pierced"
9472,SECTION LXXXVIII.,Lakshmana with three arrows discharged (from his bow). And exceedingly
9473,SECTION LXXXVIII.,dreadful was the encounter that took place between those leonine man and
9474,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"Rākshasa, each eager to conquer the other. And both powerful, and both"
9475,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"endowed with strength and possessed of prowess,—and both exceedingly"
9476,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"invincible; and both having unparalleled might and energy,—those heroes"
9477,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"faught like two planets in the welkin; or like Bala and Vrita,"
9478,SECTION LXXXVIII.,irresistible in conflict; and those high-souled ones faught like two
9479,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"lions. And showering countless shafts and displaying many maneuvers,"
9480,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"that foremost of men and that of Rākshasas, fought on cheerfully."

9483,SECTION LXXXVIII.,
9484,SECTION LXXXIX.,SECTION LXXXIX.
9485,SECTION LXXXIX.,
9486,SECTION LXXXIX.,
9487,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Then sighing like an enraged serpent, that chastiser of foes,"
9488,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Daçaratha’s son, setting shafts (on his bow-string) showered them on the"
9489,SECTION LXXXIX.,Rākshasa-chief. And hearing the twang of his bow-string the lord of
9490,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Rākshasas, with his countenance fallen, gazed at Lakshmana. And then"
9491,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Bibhishana spoke unto Sumitrā’s son as he was fighting, ""I find"
9492,SECTION LXXXIX.,"(inauspicious) signs in Rāvana’s son. Do therefore hasten on,—broken he"
9493,SECTION LXXXIX.,"is, without doubt"". Then fixing arrows (on his bow) resembling venomous"
9494,SECTION LXXXIX.,"snakes, he let go those keen shafts, like unto serpents furnished with"
9495,SECTION LXXXIX.,"poison. And smit by Lakshmana with arrows having the touch of the levin,"
9496,SECTION LXXXIX.,(Indrajit) for a while was stupified and had his senses overwhelmed. And
9497,SECTION LXXXIX.,"eying that hero—son unto Daçaratha—present in the encounter, (Indrajit)"
9498,SECTION LXXXIX.,"with his eyes crimsoned in choler, drew near Sumitrā’s son. And coming"
9499,SECTION LXXXIX.,"up to him (Lakshmana), he again addressed (that hero) in a harsh speech,"
9500,SECTION LXXXIX.,"saying,—""Dost thou not remember my prowess at that first encounter, when"
9501,SECTION LXXXIX.,"thou along with thy brother was bound up,—that now thou art discharging"
9502,SECTION LXXXIX.,"arms (at me)? Forsooth ye two in mighty encounter, with shafts"
9503,SECTION LXXXIX.,"resembling the thunder-bolt and _vajra_, by me were first laid down on"
9504,SECTION LXXXIX.,"the ground, deprived of your lives, along with your principal adherents."
9505,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Either this hath escaped thy memory or I fancy, thou plainly wishest to"
9506,SECTION LXXXIX.,"go to the abode of Yama,—inasmuch as thou hast set thy heart on beating"
9507,SECTION LXXXIX.,"me. If at the first encounter thou hast not witnessed my prowess, to-day"
9508,SECTION LXXXIX.,"shall I show it unto thee. Do thou now stay, summoning thy attention""."
9509,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Seeing this, he pierced Lakshmana with seven shafts, and Hanumān with"
9510,SECTION LXXXIX.,"ten keen-edged excellent shafts. And then, fired with double fury, that"
9511,SECTION LXXXIX.,"powerful one pierced Bibhishana with an hundred arrows, powerfully"
9512,SECTION LXXXIX.,"discharged (from his weapons). Seeing this act of Indrajit, that"
9513,SECTION LXXXIX.,"foremost of men, Rāma’s younger brother, Lakshmana, with an undaunted"
9514,SECTION LXXXIX.,"countenance, fired with wrath without minding the same,—and saying with"
9515,SECTION LXXXIX.,"a laugh,—’This is nothing’,—taking dreadful arrows, in the conflict,"
9516,SECTION LXXXIX.,"discharged them at the son of Rāvana. ""O night-rangers, heroes, coming"
9517,SECTION LXXXIX.,to the field never discharge (such shafts as these). These arrows of
9518,SECTION LXXXIX.,"thine are light and of slight strength, and they conduce to my comfort."
9519,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Heroic warriors, eager for encounter, do not fight thus"". Speaking thus,"
9520,SECTION LXXXIX.,(Lakshmana) accoutred with his bow showered vollies of shafts (on his
9521,SECTION LXXXIX.,"adversary). And at his arrows (hitting), (Indrajit’s) mighty golden mail"
9522,SECTION LXXXIX.,"fell off his person, and dropped to the platform of his car like a"
9523,SECTION LXXXIX.,cluster of stars dropping from the welkin. And with his armour dropping
9524,SECTION LXXXIX.,"off, that hero—Indrajit—was wounded with _nārāchas_, like the Sun at"
9525,SECTION LXXXIX.,"dawn. That hero—Rāvana’s son—endowed with dreadful prowess, in that"
9526,SECTION LXXXIX.,"conflict, pierced Lakshmana with a thousand shafts. And thereat"
9527,SECTION LXXXIX.,Lakshmana’s gorgeous and mighty mail was rent in pieces. And each
9528,SECTION LXXXIX.,rushing forward was engaged in dealing blows and harrying them. And
9529,SECTION LXXXIX.,"sighing again and again, they fought furiously. And with their persons"
9530,SECTION LXXXIX.,"cut all over, and laved in blood, for a long while the heroes kept"
9531,SECTION LXXXIX.,cleaving each other with sharpened shafts. And those high-souled ones
9532,SECTION LXXXIX.,"versed in warfare, and endowed with terrific prowess exerted their"
9533,SECTION LXXXIX.,"utmost in securing victory. And covered with vollies of shafts, with"
9534,SECTION LXXXIX.,"their armour and banners rent, they drew each other’s warm blood flowing"
9535,SECTION LXXXIX.,like water from a fountain. And they discharged dreadful showers
9536,SECTION LXXXIX.,"attended with tremendous sounds, like the sounds of black clouds at"
9537,SECTION LXXXIX.,Dooms-day³⁵⁸ pouring torrents in the sky. And a long time went by as
9538,SECTION LXXXIX.,"they faught. Nor did they turn away from the encounter, or know fatigue."
9539,SECTION LXXXIX.,And those foremost of those acquainted with weapons repeatedly displayed
9540,SECTION LXXXIX.,their weapons; and their long and short shafts enveloped the welkin. And
9541,SECTION LXXXIX.,"the skill that they displayed was perfect, and showed lightness, variety"
9542,SECTION LXXXIX.,and grace; and both man and the Rākshasa carried on fearful and terrible
9543,SECTION LXXXIX.,conflict. And the dreadful and tremendous roars of each were audible (at
9544,SECTION LXXXIX.,"that place); and terrific like the levin, they made the hearts of"
9545,SECTION LXXXIX.,"hearers tremble (in terror). And as they faught with might and main, the"
9546,SECTION LXXXIX.,sounds that they sent resembled the deep rumbling of clouds in the sky.
9547,SECTION LXXXIX.,"And pierced with _nārāchas_ knobbed with gold, those powerful and"
9548,SECTION LXXXIX.,"illustrious (warriors) with their hearts set on celebrity, bled"
9549,SECTION LXXXIX.,profusely. And in that engagement gold-knobbed shafts hitting each
9550,SECTION LXXXIX.,"other’s person, pierced the same and covered with gore, entered the"
9551,SECTION LXXXIX.,earth. And other shafts were resisted in the sky by sharpened weapons;
9552,SECTION LXXXIX.,"and some were snapped, and thousands of their arrows were cleft (in the"
9553,SECTION LXXXIX.,"sky). And in that field, the vollies of their shafts were dreadful to"
9554,SECTION LXXXIX.,behold like unto a heap of Kuça aflame in a sacrifice. And the wounded
9555,SECTION LXXXIX.,"frames of those high-souled ones appeared beautiful like a leafless,"
9556,SECTION LXXXIX.,flowering Kinçuka and Sālmali in a wood. And each eager to vanquish the
9557,SECTION LXXXIX.,"other, Indrajit and Lakshmana momentarily discharged tremendous and"
9558,SECTION LXXXIX.,"terrific showers (of arms). And Lakshmana smiting Rāvana’s son, and"
9559,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Rāvana’s son smiting Lakshmana,—they did not experience any fatigue. And"
9560,SECTION LXXXIX.,"with net-works of arrows deeply entering their persons, those vehement"
9561,SECTION LXXXIX.,and exceedingly powerful ones resembled mountains topped (with trees).
9562,SECTION LXXXIX.,"And all their limbs, drenched in blood and covered with arrows, looked"
9563,SECTION LXXXIX.,like a blazing fire. And a great while did they fight; yet they neither
9564,SECTION LXXXIX.,"turned away (from the fight), nor did they experience any exhaustion."
9565,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Then to remove (Lakshmana’s) fatigue from fight, the high-souled"
9566,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Bibhishana, working the weal of Lakshmana staying in front of the field,"
9567,SECTION LXXXIX.,came forward in the encounter and took up his post.
9568,SECTION LXXXIX.,

9580,SECTION LXL.,"encounter, Rāvana’s mighty and heroic brother, bearing an excellent bow,"
9581,SECTION LXL.,"stood in front of the arena. And taking up his post, he stretched his"
9582,SECTION LXL.,great bow and shot terrific sharp-pointed shafts at the Rākshasas. And
9583,SECTION LXL.,"even like thunder-bolt cleaving mighty mountains, those shafts furnished"
9584,SECTION LXL.,"with peacock’s plumes falling powerfully (upon the foe), rent the"
9585,SECTION LXL.,"Rākshasas. And those foremost of Rākshasas, Bibhishana’s followers,"
9586,SECTION LXL.,"also, in the encounter discharged darts and scimitars and _pattiças_ at"
9587,SECTION LXL.,"heroic Rākshasas. And surrounded by those Rākshasas, Bibhishana, then in"
9588,SECTION LXL.,"the midst of his followers, appeared like an elephant in the midst of"
9589,SECTION LXL.,"young ones. Then inciting the monkeys, whose dear object was to slay"
9590,SECTION LXL.,"Rāvana, that one versed in time, the foremost of Rākshasas, spoke"
9591,SECTION LXL.,"seasonably thus,—""This one that stayeth (in the field) is the sole and"
9592,SECTION LXL.,mighty support of the Rākshasa-chief; and this is his remaining force.
9593,SECTION LXL.,Why then do the monkey-chiefs remain inactive? On this wicked Rākshasa
9594,SECTION LXL.,"being slain on the edge of battle, the remnant of his army, with the"
9595,SECTION LXL.,"single exception of Rāvana, is destroyed. That hero—Prahasta—hath been"
9596,SECTION LXL.,"slain, and Nikumbha possessed of wondrous strength, and Kumbhakarna, and"

9607,SECTION LXL.,"conquer; all those Rākshasas, that had come forward, elated with the"

9609,SECTION LXL.,"the son of my brother, yet, casting off compassion will I for Rāma slay"
9610,SECTION LXL.,him.³⁵⁹ Tears surcharge the eyes of me who seeketh to slay him. Let
9611,SECTION LXL.,"therefore Lakshmana administer him his quietus. Ye monkeys, do ye in a"
9612,SECTION LXL.,"body (first) slaughter those that are beside him (Indrajit.)"" Thus"
9613,SECTION LXL.,"exhorted by that illustrious Rākshasa, the monkey-chiefs were"
9614,SECTION LXL.,exhilarated and began to flourish their tails. And then those mighty
9615,SECTION LXL.,"monkeys roared again and again, and sent up various shouts, even as"
9616,SECTION LXL.,peacocks cry on seeing clouds. And then Jāmbavān surrounded by his own
9617,SECTION LXL.,"forces, assailed the Rākshasas with rocks and with their nails and"
9618,SECTION LXL.,"teeth. Thereat Rākshasas, endowed with exceeding strength, equipped with"
9619,SECTION LXL.,"various weapons reproaching the lord of bears, as he was engaged in"
9620,SECTION LXL.,"smiting (the foe),—and renouncing fear, with shafts and sharp axes and"
9621,SECTION LXL.,"_pattiças_ and _yashtis_, and _tomaras_, in the encounter assailed"
9622,SECTION LXL.,"Jāmbavān, who was engaged in beating the Rākshasa forces. And that"
9623,SECTION LXL.,"conflict between the monkeys and the Rakshas, waxed furious, like unto"
9624,SECTION LXL.,the tumultuous encounter of the immortals and the Asuras fired with
9625,SECTION LXL.,wrath. And the magnanimous Hanumān incapable of being approached growing
9626,SECTION LXL.,"wroth,—uprooting a mountain, and putting down Lakshmana from his back,"
9627,SECTION LXL.,began a great carnage among the Rākshasas by thousands. And fighting a
9628,SECTION LXL.,"furious fight with his uncle, the powerful Indrajit—slayer of hostile"
9629,SECTION LXL.,heroes—again rushed against Lakshmana. And then there took place an
9630,SECTION LXL.,"encounter between those heroes in the field,—Lakshmana and the"
9631,SECTION LXL.,Rākshasa—discharging vollies of shafts and smiting each other; and those
9632,SECTION LXL.,mighty and impetuous ones repeatedly covered each other with networks of
9633,SECTION LXL.,arrows; like unto the sun and the moon covered by clouds at the
9634,SECTION LXL.,"expiration of Summer. And on account of their light-handedness, neither"
9635,SECTION LXL.,"discharge of arrows, nor the drawing of the bow; nor the setting of the"
9636,SECTION LXL.,shaft on the bow-string; nor the taking of the bow; nor the selection of
9637,SECTION LXL.,shafts; nor the clenching fast of their fists; nor the hitting of
9638,SECTION LXL.,"aims,—could be perceived as they fought on. And in consequence of the"
9639,SECTION LXL.,"sky being covered with networks of arrows all around, discharged"
9640,SECTION LXL.,"powerfully from their bows, the forms (of objects) could not be"
9641,SECTION LXL.,"discovered. And Lakshmana having at Rāvana’s son, and Rāvana’s son"
9642,SECTION LXL.,"having at Lakshmana, critical was the huggermugger that ensued³⁶⁰ in the"
9643,SECTION LXL.,encounter between each other. And they both kept ceaselessly showering
9644,SECTION LXL.,"feathered and sharpened shafts, the firmament was engulphed with a deep"
9645,SECTION LXL.,darkness. And in consequence of countless keen arrows alighting in
9646,SECTION LXL.,"hundreds, all sides and all the cardinal quarters were swarming with"
9647,SECTION LXL.,"shafts. And all being over-spread with gloom, a mighty fright took"
9648,SECTION LXL.,"possession (of creatures) when the Sun having ascended the setting-hill,"
9649,SECTION LXL.,and darkness environing all objects. And that day³⁶¹ mighty torrents of
9650,SECTION LXL.,blood flowed in thousands of streams; and fierce beasts of prey set up
9651,SECTION LXL.,"terrific yells (all around). And at that hour the wind did not blow, and"
9652,SECTION LXL.,"fire did not blaze; and the Maharshis said,—’Fair befell creatures.’ And"
9653,SECTION LXL.,the Gandharvas along with the Chāranas grew exceedingly agitated. Then
9654,SECTION LXL.,"Sumitrā’s son pierced the four black steeds of the leonine Rākshasa,"
9655,SECTION LXL.,caparisoned in gold. And then he hit at (Indrajit’s) charioteer with
9656,SECTION LXL.,"another yellow and sharpened javelin splendid, furnished with feathers;"
9657,SECTION LXL.,and resembling the thunder-bolt of the great Indra. And through his
9658,SECTION LXL.,fleet handedness the graceful son of Raghu with the thunder-bolt of his
9659,SECTION LXL.,"shaft, resonant with the sound of his palm, separated the (charioteer’s"
9660,SECTION LXL.,head) from his trunk. And on his charioteer having been slain the
9661,SECTION LXL.,"exceedingly energetic son of Mandodari, himself began to perform the"
9662,SECTION LXL.,"function of a charioteer, and took up his bow. And this in the encounter"
9663,SECTION LXL.,was wonderful to behold. And then as (Indrajit) was eagerly engaged in
9664,SECTION LXL.,"managing the steeds, (Lakshmana) pierced him with sharpened shafts; and"
9665,SECTION LXL.,"when (Indrajit) was eagerly wielding his bow, (Lakshmana) discharged"
9666,SECTION LXL.,"shafts at his steeds. And on his steeds having been torn with shafts,"
9667,SECTION LXL.,Sumitrā’s—foremost of fleet-handed—in the encounter assailed (Indrajit)
9668,SECTION LXL.,doubtlessly ranging the field. Seeing his charioteer slain in the
9669,SECTION LXL.,"contest, Rāvana’s son forewent his martial ardour, and was cast down."
9670,SECTION LXL.,"And seeing the Rākshasa with his face fallen, the leaders of"
9671,SECTION LXL.,"monkey-bands, were exceedingly delighted and rendered homage unto"
9672,SECTION LXL.,"Lakshmana. And then those monkey-chiefs—Pramāthi, Rabhasa, Sarabha and"
9673,SECTION LXL.,"Gandamādana, not brooking (their foe) summoned their impetuosity. And"
9674,SECTION LXL.,"suddenly springing up, those highly powerful monkeys endowed with"
9675,SECTION LXL.,terrific prowess descended upon those four best of steeds. And on those
9676,SECTION LXL.,"chargers being assailed by those monkeys resembling mountains, blood"
9677,SECTION LXL.,gushed out of their mouths. And then the steeds were smashed and sent to
9678,SECTION LXL.,"the ground. And having slain the steeds, and smitten the mighty"
9679,SECTION LXL.,"car-warrior³⁶² again by a vehement bound, came to the side of Lakshmana."
9680,SECTION LXL.,"And springing down from his car whose steeds had been slain, Rāvana’s"
9681,SECTION LXL.,"son, his charioteer having been pounded, charged the son of Sumitrā with"
9682,SECTION LXL.,"arrows. And then Lakshmana resembling the great Indra, on (Indrajit’s)"
9683,SECTION LXL.,"best of chargers having been despatched, in the encounter began to"
9684,SECTION LXL.,terribly rive with arrows discharged (his foe) footing on the earth and
9685,SECTION LXL.,showering excellent sharpened shafts.

9712,SECTION LXLI.,"wood-rangers, rushing this way and that, did not (for a moment) leave"
9713,SECTION LXLI.,"their lords. Then Rāvana’s son, gladdening all the Rākshasas, and"
9714,SECTION LXLI.,"himself feeling cheered, addressed them in words of praise, saying,—""All"

9723,SECTION LXLI.,"furnished with _prāças_ and swords and arrows, yoked with superb steeds,"
9724,SECTION LXLI.,"and driven by a charioteer, knowing horses and possessed of instructions"
9725,SECTION LXLI.,"(anent his art),—that victor in battle—the exceedingly energetic son of"

9728,SECTION LXLI.,"Rākshasas; and drawn by fast-speeding steeds, he presented himself"
9729,SECTION LXLI.,before Lakshmana along with Bibhishana. And seeing Rāvana’s son seated

9731,SECTION LXLI.,the Rākshasa—Bibhishana-—were highly amazed at the lighthandedness of

9747,SECTION LXLI.,powerful to a degree and having a stout string. And then aiming at
9748,SECTION LXLI.,"Lakshmana, he, summoning his utmost celerity, showered arrows, as"
9749,SECTION LXLI.,"showereth Purandara in the season of rains. Thereat Lakshmana, subduer"
9750,SECTION LXLI.,"of enemies, retaining his calmness, resisted that powerful arrowy shower"
9751,SECTION LXLI.,"shot by Indrajit. And then that exceedingly energetic one, Raghu’s son,"
9752,SECTION LXLI.,"possessing himself in calmness, displayed (his prowess) unto the son of"
9753,SECTION LXLI.,Rāvana; and this was wonderful (to behold). And then displaying his
9754,SECTION LXLI.,"lightness in the use of weapons, Lakshmana, growing furious, pierced the"
9755,SECTION LXLI.,Rākshasas with three arrows each in that mighty encounter; and the lord
9756,SECTION LXLI.,of Rākshasas struck him with showers of shafts. And pierced sore by that
9757,SECTION LXLI.,powerful enemy—slayer of foes—he incessantly sent innumerable arrows
9758,SECTION LXLI.,"after Lakshmana. And ere they reached their destination, that slayer of"
9759,SECTION LXLI.,hostile heroes severed them with whetted arrows; and in the encounter
9760,SECTION LXLI.,that righteous one and foremost of car-warriors with a dart having bent
9761,SECTION LXLI.,"joints, cut off the head of his charioteer mounted on the car. And"
9762,SECTION LXLI.,"deprived of their driver, there the steeds, retaining their calmness,"
9763,SECTION LXLI.,"began to go in rounds,—and this was wonderful Then Sumitrā’s son of"
9764,SECTION LXLI.,"steady prowess, fired with anger, in that contest, frightening all,"
9765,SECTION LXLI.,pierced his horses with arrows. And not brooking that act (of his
9766,SECTION LXLI.,"adversary), Rāvana’s son in the encounter pierced with ten shafts"
9767,SECTION LXLI.,Sumitrā’s son capable of making people’s down stand on end. And his
9768,SECTION LXLI.,"shafts resembling thunderbolts, and like unto all varieties of venom,"
9769,SECTION LXLI.,"touching (Lakshmana’s) mail having a golden splendour, were reduced to"
9770,SECTION LXLI.,"naught. Thereat considering Lakshmana as clad in an impenetrable armour,"
9771,SECTION LXLI.,"Rāvana’s son—Indrajit—growing furiously enraged, displaying his"
9772,SECTION LXLI.,"lighthandedness in arms, pierced Lakshmana in the temples with three"
9773,SECTION LXLI.,"well-knobbed shafts. And with those arrows lodged in his temples,"
9774,SECTION LXLI.,"Raghu’s son, delighting in battle, appeared beautiful in the field like"
9775,SECTION LXLI.,a mountain furnished with three summits. Albeit thus smitten in the
9776,SECTION LXLI.,"contest by the Raksha with shafts, Lakshmana swiftly smote him in turn"
9777,SECTION LXLI.,"with five arrows; and in the encounter Lakshmana drawing his bow,"
9778,SECTION LXLI.,pierced with shafts Indrajit’s face graced with elegant ear-rings. And
9779,SECTION LXLI.,those heroes—Lakshmana and Indrajit—equipped with exceedingly powerful
9780,SECTION LXLI.,"bows, and endowed with heroism and dreadful prowess, wounded each other"
9781,SECTION LXLI.,"with sharp arrows. And both Lakshmana and Indrajit, with their persons"
9782,SECTION LXLI.,"bathed in blood in that encounter, appeared like unto flowering"
9783,SECTION LXLI.,"Kinçukas. And approaching each other, those bowmen, each telling his"
9784,SECTION LXLI.,"heart on victory, wounded each other all over the body with terrific"
9785,SECTION LXLI.,"shafts. Then Rāvana’s son, carried away by martial rage, pierced"
9786,SECTION LXLI.,Bibhishana in his handsome face With three arrows. And piercing the lord
9787,SECTION LXLI.,"of Rākshasas, Bibhishana, he with three iron-headed arrows, pierced the"
9788,SECTION LXLI.,"monkey-leaders each with a shaft. Thereat, enraged at him more furiously"
9789,SECTION LXLI.,"than ever, the exceedingly energetic Bibhishana with his mace despatched"
9790,SECTION LXLI.,the steeds of the wicked-minded son of Rāvana. Then jumping down from
9791,SECTION LXLI.,"his chariot with its horses slain, (Indrajit), endowed with great"
9792,SECTION LXLI.,"energy, who had his charioteer pounded, discharged a dart at his uncle."
9793,SECTION LXLI.,"And seeing it descend, the enhancer of Sumitrā’s joy severed the same"
9794,SECTION LXLI.,with whetted arrows and brought it down in ten fragments to the ground.
9795,SECTION LXLI.,"And Bibhishana of a tough bow, growing enraged, discharged at"
9796,SECTION LXLI.,"(Indrajit), who had his steeds slain, five speeding shafts having the"
9797,SECTION LXLI.,touch of the thunder-bolt.—And those arrows furnished with gold at the
9798,SECTION LXLI.,"feathered parts, riving his person, were bathed in blood, and resembled"
9799,SECTION LXLI.,"mighty red serpents. Thereat wroth with his uncle, Indrajit took op an"
9800,SECTION LXLI.,excellent shaft—bestowed on him by Yama himself—endowed with terrific
9801,SECTION LXLI.,"force,—the flower of shafts among all the Rakshas. And seeing that"
9802,SECTION LXLI.,"mighty shaft set by him (on the bow-string), the highly powerful"
9803,SECTION LXLI.,"Lakshmana, possessed of dreadful prowess, (in his turn) took up another"
9804,SECTION LXLI.,"arrow, bestowed by Kuvera himself of immeasurable soul in a"
9805,SECTION LXLI.,"dream,—unconquerable, and incapable of being borne even by the"
9806,SECTION LXLI.,celestials and Asuras with Indra at their head. And on their best of
9807,SECTION LXLI.,"bows being powerfully drawn with their arms resembling bludgeons, they"
9808,SECTION LXLI.,set up cries like unto Kraunchas. And on those foremost of shafts set on
9809,SECTION LXLI.,"those excellent bows of those heroes, being drawn, flamed up in"
9810,SECTION LXLI.,"exceeding splendour. And those flaming arrows, discharged from the bows,"
9811,SECTION LXLI.,"illumining the welkin, with vehemence struck at each other’s head. And a"
9812,SECTION LXLI.,concussion took place of those arrows of terrific aspects; and a furious
9813,SECTION LXLI.,"fire sprang up thereat, with embers shooting around. And dashing against"
9814,SECTION LXLI.,"each other like unto mighty planets, they, reduced to an hundred shivers"
9815,SECTION LXLI.,"in the encounter, saught the earth. Seeing their shafts baffled,"
9816,SECTION LXLI.,"Indrajit and Lakshmana, staying on the edge of the battle, were seized"
9817,SECTION LXLI.,"with shame and wrath. Thereat Sumitrā’s son, flying into a fury, took up"
9818,SECTION LXLI.,"a Vāruna weapon. And the conquerer of the great Indra intent on battle,"
9819,SECTION LXLI.,in the encounter discharged a terrific Raudra weapon; and the
9820,SECTION LXLI.,"exceedingly wonderful Vāruna weapon was baffled by him. Then, waxing"
9821,SECTION LXLI.,"wroth, that victor in battle—the wondrous energetic Indrajit—as if"
9822,SECTION LXLI.,"annihilating the world, discharged a flaming Agneya weapon. And the"
9823,SECTION LXLI.,heroic Lakshmma resisted it with a Solar weapon. Seeing his weapon
9824,SECTION LXLI.,"resisted, Rāvana’s son, transported with passion, took up an Asura"
9825,SECTION LXLI.,"arrow, capable of rending foes. And from that weapon issued daggers and"
9826,SECTION LXLI.,clubs and darts and _bhuçundis_ and maces and swords and axes.³⁶⁶ And in
9827,SECTION LXLI.,"the conflict, seeing that dire and dreadful weapon, irrisistible to all"
9828,SECTION LXLI.,"creatures and capable of riving all arms, the effulgent Lakshmana"
9829,SECTION LXLI.,baffled it with a Māheçwara³⁶⁷ weapon. And the encounter that took place
9830,SECTION LXLI.,between them was wonderful and capable of making people’s down stand on
9831,SECTION LXLI.,end. And beings stationed in the sky surrounded Lakshmana on all sides.
9832,SECTION LXLI.,And in that terrific encounter of the monkeys and the Rākshasas
9833,SECTION LXLI.,"resounding with dreadful roars, the welkin was covered with innumerable"
9834,SECTION LXLI.,beings seized with wonderment. And saints and _Pitris_ and deities and
9835,SECTION LXLI.,"Gandharbas and birds and serpents, placing Satakratu in their front,"
9836,SECTION LXLI.,"protected Lakshmana in the conflict. And then that hero, Rāghava’s"
9837,SECTION LXLI.,"younger brother, fixed (on his bow) another superior shaft, having the"
9838,SECTION LXLI.,"feel of fire itself, and capable of riving the son of Rāvana; furnished"
9839,SECTION LXLI.,with fair feathers; tapering; having elegant joints; symmetrical; and
9840,SECTION LXLI.,"plated with gold,—an arrow capable of finishing the body; irrisistible;"
9841,SECTION LXLI.,dreadful; terrific unto Rākshasas; resembling the venom of poisonous
9842,SECTION LXLI.,serpents; and worshipped by the celestial hosts; by which the
9843,SECTION LXLI.,exceedingly energetic and wonderful Lord riding the horse³⁶⁸—Sakra—of
9844,SECTION LXLI.,old in the war between the celestials and the Asuras had defeated the
9845,SECTION LXLI.,"Dānavas. And Sumitrā’s son, Lakshmana; graced with auspiciousness,"
9846,SECTION LXLI.,drawing on his best of bows that foremost of shafts—the Aindra
9847,SECTION LXLI.,"weapon—invincible in conflict, spoke these words, tending to bring about"
9848,SECTION LXLI.,"his success,³⁶⁹—""If Daçaratha’s son—Rāma—is righteous and truthful, and"
9849,SECTION LXLI.,"if in prowess he hath no rival, then slay this son of Rāvana"". Saying"
9850,SECTION LXLI.,"this, the heroic Lakshmana in that conflict, drawing the"
9851,SECTION LXLI.,"straight-speeding arrow up to his ear,³⁷⁰ discharged it at Indrajit. And"
9852,SECTION LXLI.,"shooting the Aindra weapon, that destroyer of hostile"
9853,SECTION LXLI.,heroes—Lakshmana—severing from its trunk the head of Indrajit with its
9854,SECTION LXLI.,"corslet, graced with burning ear-rings, brought it down to the ground."
9855,SECTION LXLI.,"And the mighty severed head of the Rākshasa’s son, resembling one made"
9856,SECTION LXLI.,"of gold, was seen covered with blood. And slain, Rāvana’s son dropped to"
9857,SECTION LXLI.,"the earth, with his armour and corslet on, and his bow fallen (from his"
9858,SECTION LXLI.,"grasp). And then all the monkeys with Bibhishana set up cheers, even as"
9859,SECTION LXLI.,the immortals cheered at the destruction of Vritra. And in the sky there
9860,SECTION LXLI.,"arose the victorious shouts of all beings and high souled saints, and"
9861,SECTION LXLI.,also of Gandharbas and Apsarās. And knowing (Indrajit) fallen (in
9862,SECTION LXLI.,"fight), the mighty army of Rākshasas; attacked by monkeys burning for"
9863,SECTION LXLI.,"victory, fled in the ten cardinal directions. And assailed by the"
9864,SECTION LXLI.,"monkeys, the Rākshasas, pursued (by their foes), with their senses lost,"
9865,SECTION LXLI.,"rushed towards Lankā, leaving their arms behind. And overwhelmed with"
9866,SECTION LXLI.,"fright, Rākshasas fled in an hundred directions, all renouncing their"
9867,SECTION LXLI.,"arms—bearded darts, and swords, and axes. And harassed by the monkeys,"
9868,SECTION LXLI.,"some hurriedly entered Lankā, and some plunged into the sea, and some"
9869,SECTION LXLI.,saught shelter in the mountains. And seeing Indrajit slain and lying
9870,SECTION LXLI.,"down on the field of battle, thousands of Rākshasas fled away. As when"
9871,SECTION LXLI.,"the Sun sets, his rays remain no longer, on that Rākshasa having fallen,"
9872,SECTION LXLI.,"the Rākshasas dispersed in the ten cardinal quarters, like unto the Sun"
9873,SECTION LXLI.,"when his rays have been rendered mild, or fire which hath been"
9874,SECTION LXLI.,extinguished. And the mighty-armed (Indrajit) was utterly reft of life.
9875,SECTION LXLI.,"And on the son of the Rākshasa-chief falling, the world, having its foe"
9876,SECTION LXLI.,"slain, with its huge affliction gone off, experienced the bright of joy."
9877,SECTION LXLI.,"And on that unrighteous Rākshasa having been slain, the reverend Sakra"
9878,SECTION LXLI.,together with the Maharshis was filled with delight. And sounds of
9879,SECTION LXLI.,kettle-drums were heard in the sky proceeding from the celestials. And
9880,SECTION LXLI.,blossoms were showered by dancing Apsarās and high-souled Gandharbas.
9881,SECTION LXLI.,And this was wonderful (to behold.) And on that Rākshasa of fell deeds
9882,SECTION LXLI.,"having been slain, the dust was laid, the water became transparent, the"
9883,SECTION LXLI.,"sky looked bright, and the deities and Dānavas were filled with"
9884,SECTION LXLI.,"rejoicings. And on that Dread of all creatures having been slain, the"
9885,SECTION LXLI.,"gods, Gandharbas and Dānavas, assembled together in joy, said,—""Now let"
9886,SECTION LXLI.,"the Brahmanas who have their sins removed, with their anxiety gone off,"
9887,SECTION LXLI.,"range about"". And then the monkey-leaders, seeing that foremost of"
9888,SECTION LXLI.,"Nairitas of unparalleled prowess slain in battle, began to gladly pay"
9889,SECTION LXLI.,homage (unto Lakshmana). And Bibhishana and Hanumān and Jāmbavān—leader
9890,SECTION LXLI.,of bears—saluted and hymned Lakshmana on the score of his victory. And
9891,SECTION LXLI.,"shouting and bounding and roaring, the monkeys at this hour of high joy"
9892,SECTION LXLI.,stood surrounding Raghu’s son.³⁷¹ And flourishing their tails and
9893,SECTION LXLI.,"striking the earth (with them), the monkeys shouted,—’Victory unto"
9894,SECTION LXLI.,"Lakshmana!’ And embracing each other, the monkeys with delighted spirits"
9895,SECTION LXLI.,began to converse in various ways touching Rāghava’s welfare. And
9896,SECTION LXLI.,"beholding that deed, difficult of being done, performed by their beloved"
9897,SECTION LXLI.,"friend—Lakshmana—and hearing their foe—Indrajit—slain (in battle), the"

9929,SECTION LXLII.,"Hanumān and all the monkeys with him, speedily went to the place where"
9930,SECTION LXLII.,"Sugriva and Rāghava were. And then going round Rāma and saluted him,"
9931,SECTION LXLII.,"Sumitrā’s son stood before his brother, like Indra’s brother staying"
9932,SECTION LXLII.,before Sakra. And approaching with a look which of itself was
9933,SECTION LXLII.,"significant,³⁷² the heroic Bibhishana described unto the high-souled"
9934,SECTION LXLII.,Rāghava the dreadful destruction of Indrajit. And then the delighted
9935,SECTION LXLII.,Bibhishana related unto Rāma how the high-souled Lakshmana had cut off
9936,SECTION LXLII.,the head of Rāvana’s son. And as soon as that exceedingly powerful one
9937,SECTION LXLII.,"heard of the destruction of Indrajit by Lakshmana, he experienced a huge"

9939,SECTION LXLII.,Pleased am I (with thee). Thou hast performed a difficult feat. The son
9940,SECTION LXLII.,"of Rāvana having been slain, know for certain that we have been"

9942,SECTION LXLII.,"enhancer of fame, (Rāma) endowed with prowess, from affection forcibly"
9943,SECTION LXLII.,"hugged him into his lap. And making him seat on his lap, and"
9944,SECTION LXLII.,"overpowering him with embraces,³⁷³ (Rāma) again and again tenderly eyed"
9945,SECTION LXLII.,"his brother, Lakshmana. And moved with grief, that best of persons,"
9946,SECTION LXLII.,"Rāma, smelling the head of Lakshmana, wounded with darts and having his"
9947,SECTION LXLII.,"person pierced (with arms), sighing and breathing hard—and nursing his"

9952,SECTION LXLII.,of the fell Rāvana. Verily he (Indrajit) was his stay. Both Bibhishana
9953,SECTION LXLII.,"and Hanumān have done mighty deeds in battle. In three days and nights,"

10007,SECTION LXLIII.,"Having conquered Indra himself, wherefore to-day hast thou come under"

10037,SECTION LXLIII.,"consequence of the fire of his wrath having possessed it entirely,"
10038,SECTION LXLIII.,resembled the form of the enraged Rudra. And from the eyes of that
10039,SECTION LXLIII.,infuriated one fell drops of tears as drop from a flaming lamp drops of
10040,SECTION LXLIII.,"burning oil. And as he grinded his teeth, the gnashing resembled the"
10041,SECTION LXLIII.,sounds sent by the machine³⁷⁶ drawn by the Dānavas and churning the
10042,SECTION LXLIII.,deep. The Rākshasas durst not approach that one eying round and
10043,SECTION LXLIII.,"resembling the Destroyer himself, intent, on devouring both mobile and"
10044,SECTION LXLIII.,"immobile. Then exceedingly enraged, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—spoke in"
10045,SECTION LXLIII.,"the midst of the Rākshasas, inciting them to battle,—""I practised severe"
10046,SECTION LXLIII.,austerities for thousands of years; and gratified the Self-sprung at
10047,SECTION LXLIII.,times. Neither from Asuras nor from celestials can any fear spring to
10048,SECTION LXLIII.,"me. My mail conferred on me by Brahmā, which in effulgence resembles the"
10049,SECTION LXLIII.,"Sun himself, was not broken by blows like unto thunder-bolt at the war"
10050,SECTION LXLIII.,between the deities and demons. To-day who will come forward against me
10051,SECTION LXLIII.,in battle accoutred in that and mounted on a car in the conflict? Not
10052,SECTION LXLIII.,"even Purandara himself. Do ye, beating hundreds of drums, to-day raise"
10053,SECTION LXLIII.,"that mighty and dreadful bow of mine which, with arrows, had been"
10054,SECTION LXLIII.,bestowed on one by the gratified Self-sprung at the war of the gods and
10055,SECTION LXLIII.,"Asuras,—so that I may therewith compass the destruction of Rāma and"
10056,SECTION LXLIII.,"Lakshmana in mighty battle"". Burning (in grief) for the destruction of"
10057,SECTION LXLIII.,"his son, the fell Rāvana, coming under the influence of anger,"
10058,SECTION LXLIII.,"reflecting (in his mind), resolved to slay Sitā. And eying round, that"
10059,SECTION LXLIII.,"copper-eyed and dreadful one of a terrific aspect, distressed, in a"
10060,SECTION LXLIII.,"piteous voice addressed all the night-rangers, saying,—""By his power of"
10061,SECTION LXLIII.,"illusion, my beloved child, for deceiving the wood-rangers, slaying"
10062,SECTION LXLIII.,"something (else), had shown it unto them as Sitā. Now will I do that"
10063,SECTION LXLIII.,"good office myself,—Vaidehi will I slay—even her that is devoted to that"
10064,SECTION LXLIII.,"friend of Kshatriyas"". Having spoken thus unto his counsellors, he"
10065,SECTION LXLIII.,"swiftly took up a sword; and raising it, of excellent temper and of"
10066,SECTION LXLIII.,"cerulean hue, he rushed out vehemently, surrounded by his wives and"
10067,SECTION LXLIII.,counsellors. From grief for his son. Rāvana with his consciousness
10068,SECTION LXLIII.,"wildered, taking up a sword, in rage, rushed towards the place where"
10069,SECTION LXLIII.,"Mithilā’s daughter was. Seeing the Rākshasa rising on, some, emitted"
10070,SECTION LXLIII.,"leonine roars, and seeing the Rākshasa enraged, embracing each other,"
10071,SECTION LXLIII.,"said,—""To-day those two brothers, seeing this one, will be exceedingly"
10072,SECTION LXLIII.,"pained. By this one, influenced with passion were the four guardians of"
10073,SECTION LXLIII.,the worlds conquered; and many other foes were brought down in battle.
10074,SECTION LXLIII.,"Procuring gems from the three worlds, Rāvana enjoyeth them. Neither in"
10075,SECTION LXLIII.,"strength nor in prowess is there any one on earth who is his compeer""."
10076,SECTION LXLIII.,"As they were speaking thus, Rāvana, reft of his senses by wrath, rushed"
10077,SECTION LXLIII.,"against Vaidehi, who had taken up her abode in the Açoka wood. And"
10078,SECTION LXLIII.,"dissuaded by his friends endowed with good intelligence, he, wrought up"
10079,SECTION LXLIII.,"with high wrath, darted (against Sitā), even as an enraged planet³⁷⁷"
10080,SECTION LXLIII.,rusheth against Rohini³⁷⁸ in the firmament. And the blameless daughter
10081,SECTION LXLIII.,"of Mithila protected by the Rākshasis, saw the infuriated Rāvana bearing"
10082,SECTION LXLIII.,"that best of blades in his hand. Seeing (Rāvana) approach, sword in"
10083,SECTION LXLIII.,"hand, despite the earnest entreaties of his friends, Janaka’s daughter,"
10084,SECTION LXLIII.,"Sitā, pained and overcome by grief, said, weeping,—""From the way in"
10085,SECTION LXLIII.,"which, wrought up with wrath, this wicked-minded one is rushing on at me"
10086,SECTION LXLIII.,"personally, it appears that he will slay me, who have a lord, as one who"
10087,SECTION LXLIII.,"hath not. He did urge me much ever devoted to my lord, saying ’Be thou"
10088,SECTION LXLIII.,my wife but forsooth I disregarded him. And plainly in consequence of my
10089,SECTION LXLIII.,"refusal, he hath given way to despair. And overcome by anger and"
10090,SECTION LXLIII.,"passion, he is ready to slay me. Or it may be that to-day for me those"
10091,SECTION LXLIII.,"foremost of men, the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—have been slain in"
10092,SECTION LXLIII.,encounter by this inglorious one. I heard a furious and fearful uproar
10093,SECTION LXLIII.,"raised by countless Rākshasas rejoicing, and expressing their"
10094,SECTION LXLIII.,delight.—Alas! O fie! For me those princes have met with destruction. Or
10095,SECTION LXLIII.,"it may be that not without slaying Rāma and Lakshmana, this terrific"
10096,SECTION LXLIII.,"Rākshasa, having his heart set on sin, from grief for his son, will slay"
10097,SECTION LXLIII.,"me. Fool that I am, I did not then act agreeably to Hanumān’s words. If"
10098,SECTION LXLIII.,"I had gone away seated on his back, without waiting for the victory (of"
10099,SECTION LXLIII.,"my lord), I devoted to him, placed on his lap, should not have come by"
10100,SECTION LXLIII.,"this repentance. When Kauçalyā, having an only son, will hear of her son"
10101,SECTION LXLIII.,"slain in battle, I fancy, her heart shall burst. And, weeping, she will"
10102,SECTION LXLIII.,"remember that high-souled one’s birth and boyhood, and youth and pious"
10103,SECTION LXLIII.,"acts and loveliness. And that one bereft of her consciousness, filled"
10104,SECTION LXLIII.,"with despair, after having performed his _srāddha_³⁷⁹ will doubtless"
10105,SECTION LXLIII.,enter into fire or water. Shame on the unchaste and hump-backed
10106,SECTION LXLIII.,"Mantharā, having her heart fixed in sin, for whose sake this grief shall"
10107,SECTION LXLIII.,"exercise Kauçalyā!"" Seeing the distressed daughter of Mithilā lament"
10108,SECTION LXLIII.,"thus, like unto Rohini come under the sway of a planet in the absence of"
10109,SECTION LXLIII.,"the Moon, in the meanwhile his³⁸⁰ pure and good courtier, named"
10110,SECTION LXLIII.,"Suparçwa, endowed with intelligence, albeit prevented by other"
10111,SECTION LXLIII.,"courtiers, spoke unto Rāvana, foremost of Rākshasas,—""Wherefore, O"
10112,SECTION LXLIII.,"Ten-necked one, O thou who art the very younger brother of Vaiçravana"
10113,SECTION LXLIII.,"himself, Dost thou desire to slay Vaidehi, forsaking righteousness? Why,"
10114,SECTION LXLIII.,"O hero! O lord of Rākshasas! having led the Brahmacharyya mode of life,"
10115,SECTION LXLIII.,"studied the Vedas, and returned from the house of thy spiritual guide,"
10116,SECTION LXLIII.,"and ever engaged in religious acts, to-day dost thou intend to slay a"
10117,SECTION LXLIII.,"woman? Do thou, O king, now stay expecting Mithilā’s daughter³⁸¹ endowed"
10118,SECTION LXLIII.,with loveliness; and do thou along with us vent thy wrath on him.³⁸²
10119,SECTION LXLIII.,"To-day being the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, do thou this very"
10120,SECTION LXLIII.,"day prepare for conflict; at _amāvasyā_,³⁸³ environed with thy forces,"
10121,SECTION LXLIII.,"do thou march for victory. Heroic, and intelligent, a mighty car-warrior"
10122,SECTION LXLIII.,"and swordsman, thou, mounted on a car, slaying the redoubtable son of"
10123,SECTION LXLIII.,"Daçaratha, wilt obtain Mithilā’s daughter"". Thus exhorted by his friend,"
10124,SECTION LXLIII.,the unrighteous Rāvana accepted his virtuous speech; and then that
10125,SECTION LXLIII.,"powerful one went (back) to his house, and, surrounded by his friends,"

10158,SECTION LXLIV.,"Entering his court, the king, distressed, and exceedingly aggrieved, sat"
10159,SECTION LXLIV.,him down on the foremost seat sighing like an enraged lion. And stricken
10160,SECTION LXLIV.,"with grief in consequence of his son’s death, that highly powerful"
10161,SECTION LXLIV.,"Rāvana, with folded hands, addressed all the heroic Rākshasas,"
10162,SECTION LXLIV.,"saying:—""Do ye all proceed to battle with elephants, horses and cars."
10163,SECTION LXLIV.,"And encircling Rāma only and discharging shafts at him, delightedly,"
10164,SECTION LXLIV.,"like unto clouds, in the rainy season, pouring water, do ye slay him. Or"
10165,SECTION LXLIV.,"I shall slay him to-morrow in the presence of all, wounded by you in the"
10166,SECTION LXLIV.,"mighty encounter with sharpened arrows"". Hearing the speech of their"
10167,SECTION LXLIV.,"lord the Rākshasas, with a huge army and a host of cars, speedily issued"
10168,SECTION LXLIV.,out for battle. And they all threw at the monkeys life-destroying
10169,SECTION LXLIV.,"_Parighas_, _Pattiças_, arrows, daggers and _Paraskwadhas_. And the"
10170,SECTION LXLIV.,monkeys too threw crags and trees at the Rākshasas. Thus on the eve of
10171,SECTION LXLIV.,sun set there arose a terrible conflict between the Rākshasas and the
10172,SECTION LXLIV.,"monkeys. And they struck each other in the conflict with clubs,"
10173,SECTION LXLIV.,"_chitras_, _Prasas_, daggers and _Paraskwadhas_. The conflict being thus"
10174,SECTION LXLIV.,"carried on, there arose a mighty dust which was again destroyed by the"
10175,SECTION LXLIV.,current of blood gushing out of the persons of the Rākshasas and the
10176,SECTION LXLIV.,"monkeys. Elephants and cars were like the banks of that river of blood,"
10177,SECTION LXLIV.,"the arrows were like the fishes, and the flags were the trees on their"
10178,SECTION LXLIV.,banks and the corpses were like planks afloat there. Being thus wounded
10179,SECTION LXLIV.,"and assailed by the Rākshasas, those heroic monkeys leaped and broke"
10180,SECTION LXLIV.,"down the flags, armours, cars, horses and other weapons. And with their"
10181,SECTION LXLIV.,"sharp teeth and nails they scratched the hair, ears, foreheads and the"
10182,SECTION LXLIV.,"noses of the Rākshasas. Like unto vultures falling upon a felled tree,"
10183,SECTION LXLIV.,hundreds of monkeys fell upon one Rākshasa in that encounter. And the
10184,SECTION LXLIV.,"Rākshasas resembling mountains, with huge clubs, _prāsas_, daggers and"
10185,SECTION LXLIV.,"_parāshwadhas_, struck the monkeys (in their turn). Being thus assailed"
10186,SECTION LXLIV.,"by the Rākshasas, the mighty host of monkeys took refuge of Rāma, the"
10187,SECTION LXLIV.,"son of Daçaratha, the worthy refuge of all creatures. Thereupon the"
10188,SECTION LXLIV.,"highly effulgent and powerful Rāma, taking up his bow, entered the"
10189,SECTION LXLIV.,Rākshasa host and began to make a downpour of arrows. And Rāma entering
10190,SECTION LXLIV.,"the field, those terrible Rākshasas, being burnt with the fire of his"
10191,SECTION LXLIV.,"arrows, could not stand before him like unto clouds disappearing before"
10192,SECTION LXLIV.,the Sun in the welkin. And the night-rangers only espied the dreadful
10193,SECTION LXLIV.,feats performed by Rāma and which were above the power of others. Except
10194,SECTION LXLIV.,when guiding the huge army or driving the cars they could not see Rāma
10195,SECTION LXLIV.,like unto the wind invisible in a forest. They all beheld the Rākshasa
10196,SECTION LXLIV.,"force scattered, wounded, burnt down with arrows, broken and assailed"
10197,SECTION LXLIV.,"with weapons, by Rāma, but none could see the quick-moving Rāma. As"
10198,SECTION LXLIV.,people cannot see the soul which governs all objects of sense so they
10199,SECTION LXLIV.,"could not see Rāma, who was thus inflicting wounds on them. ""It is he"
10200,SECTION LXLIV.,"who is destroying the soldiers riding the elephants, it is he who is"
10201,SECTION LXLIV.,"breaking down the mighty cars, and it is he who with sharp arrows is"
10202,SECTION LXLIV.,"slaying the cavalry—rider and horse"". Thus saying those Rākshasas, in"
10203,SECTION LXLIV.,"that conflict and in the very presence of Rāma, highly enraged, began to"
10204,SECTION LXLIV.,slay each other. They were all bewildered by the huge Gandharba weapon
10205,SECTION LXLIV.,"discharged by the high-souled Rāma and so they could not see Rāma, who"
10206,SECTION LXLIV.,was thus burning down their force. And the Rākshasas sometimes beheld
10207,SECTION LXLIV.,thousands of Rāma in the battle field and again saw one Rāma only. They
10208,SECTION LXLIV.,at times saw the quick-moving golden end of the bow of that high-souled
10209,SECTION LXLIV.,"one, resembling a circular fire brand but they did not behold Rāghava."
10210,SECTION LXLIV.,"And he looked like _kāla chakra_, having his middle body as its navel,"
10211,SECTION LXLIV.,"his own strength as its lustre, the arrow for its radius or spoke, the"
10212,SECTION LXLIV.,"bow for the circumference, the twang of the bow for its sound, his power"
10213,SECTION LXLIV.,"and intelligence for its brightness, and the aim of the celestial"
10214,SECTION LXLIV.,weapons for its limit. And in the eighth division of the time by Rāma
10215,SECTION LXLIV.,alone with arrows resembling the flame of fire were destroyed ten
10216,SECTION LXLIV.,"thousands swift-coursing cars, eighteen thousand elephants fourteen"
10217,SECTION LXLIV.,thousands horses and riders and two million Rākshasa infantry assuming
10218,SECTION LXLIV.,"shapes at will. And those night-rangers, who were still left, having"
10219,SECTION LXLIV.,"their horses killed, cars and flags broken, fled in fear of life to the"
10220,SECTION LXLIV.,"city of Lankā. And the battle field, filled with slain horses elephants"
10221,SECTION LXLIV.,"and infantry, looked like the high-souled and enraged Rudra’s arena of"
10222,SECTION LXLIV.,"sports. Thereupon the celestials with Gandharbas, Siddhas and the great"
10223,SECTION LXLIV.,ascetics glorified the wonderful feat of Rāma. And the virtuous-souled
10224,SECTION LXLIV.,"Rāma addressed Sugriva, Bibhishana the monkey Hanumān, the leading"
10225,SECTION LXLIV.,"monkey Jāmbavān, Mainda and Divida who were near him, saying—""This is"
10226,SECTION LXLIV.,"the power of my weapons and as well as that of Rudra"". The high-souled"
10227,SECTION LXLIV.,"Rāma, equalling Sakra in prowess, thus slaying the huge host of the lord"
10228,SECTION LXLIV.,"of Rākshasas and assailing them with shafts and weapons—the celestials,"
10229,SECTION LXLIV.,"delighted, sang his praises."

10238,SECTION LXLV.,"riders, many a car crested with flaming banners; thousands of heroic"
10239,SECTION LXLV.,"Rākshasas assuming shapes at will, engaged by Rāvana, and armed with"
10240,SECTION LXLV.,clubs and _parighās_; and golden pennons. Beholding and hearing of this
10241,SECTION LXLV.,"the remaining night-rangers assembled and were greatly bewildered,"
10242,SECTION LXLV.,poorly and stricken with anxiety. The widows and those who had lost
10243,SECTION LXLV.,their children or kinsmen approached those Rākshasas and overwhelmed
10244,SECTION LXLV.,"with grief, bewailed piteously,—""Alas! why did the aged and grim-visaged"
10245,SECTION LXLV.,"Surpanakhā, having her belly extending down-ward, behold in the forest"
10246,SECTION LXLV.,Rāma graceful like Kandarpa. And beholding him of great beauty and
10247,SECTION LXLV.,"prowess, ever engaged in the welfare of all creatures, that ugly one,"
10248,SECTION LXLV.,"worthy of being slain by people, was excited with lust. Why did that"
10249,SECTION LXLV.,"ugly-faced she-demon, devoid of all qualities, address Rāma, having a"
10250,SECTION LXLV.,"beautiful countenance, gifted with many virtues and great effulgence?"
10251,SECTION LXLV.,"Alas for the misfortune of the Rākshasas, the aged Rākshasee brought"
10252,SECTION LXLV.,"before him such a vile proposal, hated of all and worthy of creating"
10253,SECTION LXLV.,"laughter. For the destruction of Khara, Dushana and other Rākshasas that"
10254,SECTION LXLV.,ugly one approached Rāghava with such a vile intention. It was for her
10255,SECTION LXLV.,that Rāvana created enmity (with Rāma) and Sitā was carried away by the
10256,SECTION LXLV.,Ten-necked Rākshasa. But he could not spread his influence upon Sitā the
10257,SECTION LXLV.,daughter of king Janaka and deep rooted and eternal became the enmity
10258,SECTION LXLV.,with the highly powerful Rāghava. And beholding the Rākshasa Birādha
10259,SECTION LXLV.,slain by Rāma alone—(Rāvana) wishing Vaidehi should have regarded that
10260,SECTION LXLV.,as a sufficient proof of his prowess. And fourteen thousand Rākshasas of
10261,SECTION LXLV.,terrible deeds were slain by him in Janasthāna with shafts resembling
10262,SECTION LXLV.,"the flame of fire. Khara, Dushana as well as Triçirā were slain by him"
10263,SECTION LXLV.,in conflict with arrows resembling the Sun—this was a sufficient proof
10264,SECTION LXLV.,"(of his power). Yoyanabāhu and Kavandha, drinking blood, were slain by"
10265,SECTION LXLV.,"him, roaring with wrath—this too was a sufficient proof of his power."
10266,SECTION LXLV.,"Rāma slew the powerful Vāli, the son of the thousand eyed one,"
10267,SECTION LXLV.,resembling the cloud—that too was the sufficient proof of his prowess.
10268,SECTION LXLV.,"By him Sugriva, poorly and living in the mount Rishyamukha, having all"
10269,SECTION LXLV.,"his desires frustrated, was placed on the throne—that too even was the"
10270,SECTION LXLV.,sufficient proof of his power. He (Rāvana) from foolishness did not like
10271,SECTION LXLV.,the becoming speech of Bibhishana conducive to the acquirement of piety
10272,SECTION LXLV.,and wealth and securing the welfare of the Rākshasas. Had the younger
10273,SECTION LXLV.,"brother of the lord of wealth (Rāvana) observed the words of Bibhishana,"
10274,SECTION LXLV.,Lankā would not have been overwhelmed with grief and reduced to the
10275,SECTION LXLV.,state of a cremation ground. Hearing of the destruction of the highly
10276,SECTION LXLV.,powerful Kumbhakarna by Rāma. of the irrepressible Atikaya by Lakshmana
10277,SECTION LXLV.,"as well as of his beloved son Indrajit, Rāvana did not come to his"
10278,SECTION LXLV.,"senses.³⁸⁴ There is audible in every house of the Rākshasas, the"
10279,SECTION LXLV.,"cry,—’My son, my brother, my husband is slain in battle.’ In conflict"
10280,SECTION LXLV.,"have been destroyed by the heroic Rāma, thousand cars, horses, serpents"
10281,SECTION LXLV.,"and infantry. Perhaps Rudra, Vishnu, Mahendra or the performer of"
10282,SECTION LXLV.,"hundred sacrifices, or even Death, in the shape of Rāma, is slaying us."
10283,SECTION LXLV.,By Rāma all the heroes have been slain—despair has taken possession of
10284,SECTION LXLV.,our minds—we do not behold the end of our terror and are bewailing being
10285,SECTION LXLV.,"deprived of our lords. Does not the Ten-necked hero, who has obtained"
10286,SECTION LXLV.,boons (from Brahmā) perceive that a mighty disaster shall befall him
10287,SECTION LXLV.,"from Rāma? Neither the celestials, Gandharbas, Piçachas nor Rākshasas"
10288,SECTION LXLV.,shall be able to save him from Rāma in conflict. In every battle many an
10289,SECTION LXLV.,accident befalls Rāvana—this bespeaks of his destruction at the hands of
10290,SECTION LXLV.,"Rāma. The great Patriarch, being pleased, conferred upon Rāvana the boon"
10291,SECTION LXLV.,"that no fear would proceed unto him from the celestials, the Dānavas or"
10292,SECTION LXLV.,"the Rākshasas—but he did not beg of him, security from men. Forsooth, he"
10293,SECTION LXLV.,is that fearful man who shall slay Rāvana and the Rākshasas. The
10294,SECTION LXLV.,"celestials, being thus oppressed by Rāvana, who had obtained the boon,"
10295,SECTION LXLV.,worshipped the great Patriarch with severe austerities. And being
10296,SECTION LXLV.,"propitiated with them, the high-souled Patriarch, for their welfare,"
10297,SECTION LXLV.,"addressed the celestials, with the following pregnant speech. ""From"
10298,SECTION LXLV.,"to-day shall the Rākshasas and Dānavas roam for ever, afraid of the"
10299,SECTION LXLV.,"celestials"". Thereupon the celestials headed by Indra engaged in"
10300,SECTION LXLV.,"propitiating Mahādeva, the slayer of Tripura, and who rides upon a bull."
10301,SECTION LXLV.,"And being pleased, Mahadeva addressed them, saying,—""For your welfare"
10302,SECTION LXLV.,there will be born a woman who shall be the cause of the destruction of
10303,SECTION LXLV.,"the Rākshasas"". As hunger, being engaged by the celestials, did destroy"
10304,SECTION LXLV.,"in olden time, all the Dānavas, so shall she (Sitā) the root of the"
10305,SECTION LXLV.,extinction of Rākshasa race destroy us all with Rāvana. Alas! for the
10306,SECTION LXLV.,foolishness of the vicious-minded and insolent Rāvana destruction has
10307,SECTION LXLV.,faced us and we are overwhelmed with grief. We do not see any such being
10308,SECTION LXLV.,in the world who can afford us shelter. Rāghava has attacked us like
10309,SECTION LXLV.,unto the fire of dissolution. There is no refuge for us who have been

10326,SECTION LXLVI.,Whereupon Rāvana heard in every house of Lankā the piteous cries of the
10327,SECTION LXLVI.,she-demons possessed by sorrow. And sighing hard he engaged in
10328,SECTION LXLVI.,"meditation for some time. And terrible-looking as he was, Rāvana was"
10329,SECTION LXLVI.,"greatly worked up with ire. Having his eyes reddened with anger, and"
10330,SECTION LXLVI.,"gnashing his teeth and biting the lips, that one, irrepressible by other"
10331,SECTION LXLVI.,"Rākshasas, looked like the fire of dissolution incarnate. Thereupon the"
10332,SECTION LXLVI.,"lord of Rākshasas in anger as if burning down everything with his look,"
10333,SECTION LXLVI.,"addressed the Rakshas who were near him—Mahodara, Mahāpārsha,"
10334,SECTION LXLVI.,"Birupāksha—""Do ye speedily speak to the soldiers that they should sally"
10335,SECTION LXLVI.,"out for battle at my command. Hearing his speech—those Rakshas,"
10336,SECTION LXLVI.,"possessed by fear, asked by the command of the king, the Rākshasa"
10337,SECTION LXLVI.,soldiers to be ready. And thereat all those grim-visaged Rākshasas
10338,SECTION LXLVI.,saying ’so be it’ and performing benedictory ceremonies proceeded to the
10339,SECTION LXLVI.,"battle-field. And those mighty car-warriors, worshipping Rāvana, and"
10340,SECTION LXLVI.,"desiring the victory of their lord, stood before them with folded hands."
10341,SECTION LXLVI.,"Thereupon Rāvana, beside himself with anger, laughing, adddressed those"
10342,SECTION LXLVI.,"Rākshasas, Mahodara, Mahāpārsha, and Birupāksha, saying—""To-day shall I"
10343,SECTION LXLVI.,despatch both Rāma and Lakshmana to the abode of Death with arrows
10344,SECTION LXLVI.,"resembling the sun at the time of dissolution, discharged off my bow."

10346,SECTION LXLVI.,"Prahasta and Indrajit. The atmosphere, the quarters the sky and the deep"
10347,SECTION LXLVI.,being enveloped with the cloud of arrows shall become invisible. I shall
10348,SECTION LXLVI.,slay to-day all the heroic monkeys with my winged arrows. Ascending my
10349,SECTION LXLVI.,car gifted with the velocity of the wind shall I churn to day the monkey
10350,SECTION LXLVI.,host with arrow-like waves coming from the ocean-like bow. I shall like
10351,SECTION LXLVI.,an elephant distress to-day the monkey-like pools having their
10352,SECTION LXLVI.,"countenances for the blown lotuses, and the lustre of their bodies for"
10353,SECTION LXLVI.,"the filaments. To-day in the encounter, the leaders of the monkey hosts,"
10354,SECTION LXLVI.,"with their heads transfixed with arrows, shall cover the earth, like"
10355,SECTION LXLVI.,"unto lotuses with their stalks. I shall to-day with a single arrow,"
10356,SECTION LXLVI.,cleave hundreds of heroic monkeys fighting with trees in their hands. I
10357,SECTION LXLVI.,shall wipe to-day the tears of those whose brother or son has been slain
10358,SECTION LXLVI.,"by destroying their foe. In the encounter to-day I shall, with the"
10359,SECTION LXLVI.,"monkeys deprived of their breath and clept with my arrows, so cover the"
10360,SECTION LXLVI.,earth that it may not be seen by any. I shall satisfy to-day with the
10361,SECTION LXLVI.,"flesh of the enemies slain by my shafts, the crows, vultures and others"
10362,SECTION LXLVI.,who live upon flesh. Get ready soon my car and bring my bow. And let the
10363,SECTION LXLVI.,"remaining night-rangers follow me in battle"". Hearing his words"
10364,SECTION LXLVI.,"Mahāpārsha addressed the leaders of the army who were near him,"
10365,SECTION LXLVI.,"saying,—""Get your soldiers ready"". And the commanders too quickly went"
10366,SECTION LXLVI.,round all the houses in Lankā and asked the Rākshasas to be ready soon.
10367,SECTION LXLVI.,"Thereupon began to issue out in a moment terrible-looking Rākshasas,"
10368,SECTION LXLVI.,"emitting roars, having dreadful faces and with various weapons in their"
10369,SECTION LXLVI.,"hands—daggers, _Pattiças_, maces, clubs, furrows, sharpened _saktis_,"
10370,SECTION LXLVI.,"traps, various rods, sharpened _chakra_, _parashwadhas_, _vindipalas_,"
10371,SECTION LXLVI.,_satāghnis_ and various other excellent weapons. Thereupon at the
10372,SECTION LXLVI.,command of Rāvana the commanders brought one _Nijuta_ (a hundred
10373,SECTION LXLVI.,"thousand) cars, three _Nijuta_ elephants, sixty million horses, asses"
10374,SECTION LXLVI.,and camels and numberless infantry. They arranged the soldiers before
10375,SECTION LXLVI.,the king and in the interval the charioteer brought the car—filled with
10376,SECTION LXLVI.,"excellent celestial weapons—richly adorned, containing many an armour,"
10377,SECTION LXLVI.,"girt with a network of tinkling ornaments, crested with various jewels,"
10378,SECTION LXLVI.,having jewelled pillars and a thousand golden jars. Beholding the car
10379,SECTION LXLVI.,"the Rākshasas were greatly astonished. And Rāvana, the lord of"
10380,SECTION LXLVI.,"Rākshasas, rising up all on a sudden, ascended that car, brilliant like"
10381,SECTION LXLVI.,"the flaming fire and the aggregate rays of a million sun,"
10382,SECTION LXLVI.,"quick-coursing, having a charioteer, drawn by eight horses, huge and"
10383,SECTION LXLVI.,"shining in its native lustre. Thereupon proceeded Rāvana, encircled by"
10384,SECTION LXLVI.,many a Rākshasa as if rending the earth with the excess of his prowess.
10385,SECTION LXLVI.,"There arose a huge sound of bugles accompanied with that of Mridangas,"
10386,SECTION LXLVI.,"drums, conchs, and _kalāpas_. The lord of the Rakshas—wicked, the slayer"
10387,SECTION LXLVI.,"of the Brahmins—the thorn of the celestials, and who hath brought away"
10388,SECTION LXLVI.,"Sitā by stealth, has come with his umbrellas and chowries to fight with"
10389,SECTION LXLVI.,the foremost of Raghus—this cry was heard everywhere. And with his
10390,SECTION LXLVI.,"tremendous roar the earth shook. And hearing all on a sudden that sound,"
10391,SECTION LXLVI.,"the monkeys fled away in fear. And the highly effulgent Rāvana, having"
10392,SECTION LXLVI.,"huge arms and surrounded by his ministers, came there being certain of"
10393,SECTION LXLVI.,"gaining victory. Being commanded by Rāvana, Mahāpārsha, Mahodara and the"
10394,SECTION LXLVI.,"irrepresible Birupāksha ascended the car. They, desirous of winning"
10395,SECTION LXLVI.,"victory, issued out emitting dreadful roars in delight and as if rending"
10396,SECTION LXLVI.,the earth therewith. Thereupon the highly effulgent (Rāvana) resembling
10397,SECTION LXLVI.,"Death, with uplifted bow, sallied out for battle along with the army of"
10398,SECTION LXLVI.,"Rakshas. And that mighty car-warrior, went out in his chariot drawn by"
10399,SECTION LXLVI.,quick-coursing steeds by that gate which led to where Rāma and Lakshmana
10400,SECTION LXLVI.,were. Thereat the sun lost its brilliance—the quarters were enshrouded
10401,SECTION LXLVI.,with darkness; the birds sent forth dreadful cries and the earth shook.
10402,SECTION LXLVI.,The celestials poured down bloody rains—the course of the horses was
10403,SECTION LXLVI.,slackened—the vultures sat on the banners and jackals emitted
10404,SECTION LXLVI.,"inauspicious cries, his left eye and the left arm began to shake—his"
10405,SECTION LXLVI.,countenance became pale and his voice grew harsher. The Ten-necked
10406,SECTION LXLVI.,Rākshasa thus going out for battle there appeared many bad omens
10407,SECTION LXLVI.,indicating his destruction. From the sky fell a fire-brand accompanied
10408,SECTION LXLVI.,with the sound of thunder; vultures and crows emitted inauspicious
10409,SECTION LXLVI.,"cries. Disregarding these dreadful omens which appeared then, Rāvana,"
10410,SECTION LXLVI.,"incited by death, foolishly went out to slay his (enemies). And by the"
10411,SECTION LXLVI.,wheel-sound of the chariots of the great Rākshasas the host of monkeys
10412,SECTION LXLVI.,"calling each other, excited with anger and willing to gain victory,"
10413,SECTION LXLVI.,"addressed themselves for fight. Thereupon the Ten-necked one, enraged,"
10414,SECTION LXLVI.,"with his arrows feathered in gold, made a dreadful slaughter of the army"
10415,SECTION LXLVI.,of monkeys. And some of those heroic monkeys were beheaded by
10416,SECTION LXLVI.,Rāvana—some had their hearts rent and others were shorn of their ears.
10417,SECTION LXLVI.,"Some had their breath choked, some were killed and others had their"
10418,SECTION LXLVI.,sides broken. Some had their hands cut off and others had their eyes put
10419,SECTION LXLVI.,"out. And wherever in the encounter, the Ten-headed Rākshasa, whirling"
10420,SECTION LXLVI.,"his eyes in ire, went in his car—the monkey leaders could not stand the"
10421,SECTION LXLVI.,vehemence of his arrows.

10428,SECTION LXLVII.,There the earth was covered with monkeys whose bodies were rent with the
10429,SECTION LXLVII.,arrows of the Ten-necked (Rāvana). As the flies cannot stand before the
10430,SECTION LXLVII.,flaming fire so they could not bear the vehemence of Rāvana’s shafts.
10431,SECTION LXLVII.,"Being thus assailed with pointed arrows they fled away crying, like unto"
10432,SECTION LXLVII.,elephants being burnt by fire. And Rāvana with his arrows pursued in
10433,SECTION LXLVII.,conflict the course of clouds. Thus slaughtering the monkeys the lords
10434,SECTION LXLVII.,of Rākshasas speedily reached in the encounter where Rāghava was. And
10435,SECTION LXLVII.,beholding the monkeys assailed and afraid Sugriva placing Sushena in
10436,SECTION LXLVII.,charge of a _gulma_³⁸⁵ addressed himself for the battle. And placing
10437,SECTION LXLVII.,"that heroic monkey, his equal in prowess, in that command Sugriva"
10438,SECTION LXLVII.,sallied out with a tree in his hand to meet the enemy. And followed him
10439,SECTION LXLVII.,on all sides the leaders of the monkeys with huge crags and various
10440,SECTION LXLVII.,trees. The heroic Sugriva emitted terrible roars in the conflict and
10441,SECTION LXLVII.,assailed the heroic Rākshasas and many others. The huge-bodied
10442,SECTION LXLVII.,monkey-chief crushed the Rākshasas like unto the wind uprooting the
10443,SECTION LXLVII.,trees at the time of dissolution. He began to make a downpour of crags
10444,SECTION LXLVII.,at the Rākshasa host like unto the cloud pouring down hailstorms at the
10445,SECTION LXLVII.,birds in the forest. And being beheaded by the crags discharged by that
10446,SECTION LXLVII.,monkey chief the Rākshasas fell down like unto mountains cleft. The
10447,SECTION LXLVII.,Rākshasas being thus attacked and shattered by Sugriva and roaring and
10448,SECTION LXLVII.,"falling down on all sides, an irrepressible Rākshasa, skilled in"
10449,SECTION LXLVII.,"archery, by name Birupāksha, pronouncing his own name, got down from the"
10450,SECTION LXLVII.,car and mounted an elephant. And mounted on the elephant that highly
10451,SECTION LXLVII.,powerful Birupāksha sent forth leonine roars and dashed against the
10452,SECTION LXLVII.,monkeys. Exciting the joy of the Rākshasas and removing their anxiety he
10453,SECTION LXLVII.,discharged dreadful shafts at Sugriva and his army. And being assailed
10454,SECTION LXLVII.,by the pointed arrows of that Rākshasa that lord of monkeys roared in
10455,SECTION LXLVII.,anger and made up his mind to destroy him. Thereupon uprooting a tree
10456,SECTION LXLVII.,"the heroic monkey, skilled in warfare, leaped and struck that huge"
10457,SECTION LXLVII.,elephant down in his presence. And being assailed greatly by Sugriva
10458,SECTION LXLVII.,that huge elephant proceeded a little within the range of the bow and
10459,SECTION LXLVII.,roared and died. And being; greatly enraged on the destruction of that
10460,SECTION LXLVII.,elephant the highly powerful Rākshasa dashed forward to face the enemy.
10461,SECTION LXLVII.,"That one of quick movements took up his dagger and armour and viling,"
10462,SECTION LXLVII.,approached Sugriva. And beholding his movement Sugriva took up a huge
10463,SECTION LXLVII.,crag resembling a cloud and hurled it against Birupāksha. That highly
10464,SECTION LXLVII.,"powerful leading Rākshasa, finding the crag about to fall, turned a"
10465,SECTION LXLVII.,little away and struck the monkey with his dagger. And being assailed
10466,SECTION LXLVII.,with dagger by that powerful Rākshasa the monkey remained senseless for
10467,SECTION LXLVII.,"sometime on the ground. And rising up all on a sudden he, clenching his"
10468,SECTION LXLVII.,"fist, struck that Rākshasa in the mighty encounter on his breast and got"
10469,SECTION LXLVII.,him down. Being struck with the fist the night-ranger Birupāksha greatly
10470,SECTION LXLVII.,enraged cut down with his dagger Sugriva’s armour and tumbled him down
10471,SECTION LXLVII.,with his feet. And the monkey rising up again was about to deal him a
10472,SECTION LXLVII.,"blow, hard as a thunder-bolt, with a dreadful sound. And receding a"
10473,SECTION LXLVII.,"little, he baffled its aim and returned one on Sugriva’s breast. Finding"
10474,SECTION LXLVII.,"his aim baffled and himself struck in return by the Rākshasa, Sugriva,"
10475,SECTION LXLVII.,"the lord of monkeys, was excited with anger. And the monkey-chief was"
10476,SECTION LXLVII.,now on the look-out for an opportunity to strike Birupāksha. And
10477,SECTION LXLVII.,immediately in anger he struck him down with a blow on his forehead. And
10478,SECTION LXLVII.,being thus assailed with the fist resembling the thunder-bolt of
10479,SECTION LXLVII.,"Mahendra, he fell down on the earth bathed in a pool of blood. And blood"
10480,SECTION LXLVII.,gushed out of the person of Birupāksha like unto water issuing out of a
10481,SECTION LXLVII.,fountain. And the monkeys beheld their enemy (Birupāksha) with his eyes
10482,SECTION LXLVII.,"disfigured in anger, bathed in a foam of blood, his whole body"
10483,SECTION LXLVII.,"discoloured, trembling, rolling and crying piteously. Thereupon those"
10484,SECTION LXLVII.,"two armies of the monkeys and Rākshasas, being ready to engage in the"
10485,SECTION LXLVII.,"encounter, began to roar like unto two mighty oceans having their banks"
10486,SECTION LXLVII.,"broken. And observing that highly powerful Rākshasa, of discoloured"
10487,SECTION LXLVII.,"eyes, slain by the king of monkeys, the monkeys and Rākshasa forces"
10488,SECTION LXLVII.,engaged in fight and looked like the rising Ganges.

10500,SECTION LXLVIII.,"Beholding his own army and Birupāksha slain, Rāvana, the lord of"
10501,SECTION LXLVIII.,"Rākshasas, was doubly excited with ire. And observing his army reduced"
10502,SECTION LXLVIII.,and slain by the heroic (monkeys) he perceived ill omens in the fight
10503,SECTION LXLVIII.,"and was accordingly pained at heart. And he addressed Mahodara, who was"
10504,SECTION LXLVIII.,"near him, saying, ""O thou of great arms, all my hopes of success are now"
10505,SECTION LXLVIII.,"centered in thee. Do thou slay the enemy’s force, O hero, and display"
10506,SECTION LXLVIII.,thy prowess. Now hath come the time of returning the favours of thy
10507,SECTION LXLVIII.,"master. Do thou fight bravely"". Being thus accosted that Rākshasa-chief"
10508,SECTION LXLVIII.,"Mahodara, saying ""so be it"" entered the enemy’s army like unto a fly"
10509,SECTION LXLVIII.,entering into a flame. Excited by his master’s command and empowered by
10510,SECTION LXLVIII.,"his own prowess that (Rākshasa) gifted with great strength, began to"
10511,SECTION LXLVIII.,assail the monkeys. And the highly powerful monkeys too taking up huge
10512,SECTION LXLVIII.,crags dashed against the dreadful army of the enemies and crushed all
10513,SECTION LXLVIII.,"the Rākshasas. And Mahodara, greatly angered, severed in that mighty"
10514,SECTION LXLVIII.,"encounter, with his arrows feathered in gold, the hands, feet and thighs"
10515,SECTION LXLVIII.,"of the monkeys. Then the monkeys, in fear of the Rākshasas, fled away to"
10516,SECTION LXLVIII.,different quarters and some sought shelter of Sugriva. And beholding his
10517,SECTION LXLVIII.,"powerful monkey force thus assailed in the conflict, Sugriva dashed"
10518,SECTION LXLVIII.,forward and fronted Mahodara. And taking up a huge and dreadful crag
10519,SECTION LXLVIII.,"resembling a mountain, the monkey-king hurled it with great vehemence to"
10520,SECTION LXLVIII.,"slay him. Thereupon finding that crag about to fall, Mahodara fearlessly"
10521,SECTION LXLVIII.,severed it with his arrows. And being sundered into a thousand pieces by
10522,SECTION LXLVIII.,"the arrow of that Rākshasa, it fell down on the earth like unto a band"
10523,SECTION LXLVIII.,"of vultures. And beholding that crag thus severed, Sugriva was beside"
10524,SECTION LXLVIII.,himself with ire; and uplifting a _sāla_ tree hurled it: and the heroic
10525,SECTION LXLVIII.,"Rākshasa, the slayer of enemy’s force, severed it into several pieces"
10526,SECTION LXLVIII.,with his arrows. Thereupon excited with wrath he saw a _parigha_ on the
10527,SECTION LXLVIII.,ground. And hurling that flaming _parigha_ and displaying his
10528,SECTION LXLVIII.,(light-handedness) he struck his excellent horse therewith. And having
10529,SECTION LXLVIII.,"his horse slain, that hero—the Rākshasa Mahodara, ascended his car, and"
10530,SECTION LXLVIII.,"in great anger took up his club. Those two heroes, with club and"
10531,SECTION LXLVIII.,"_parigha_ in their hands, engaged in battle, roaring like two bulls or"
10532,SECTION LXLVIII.,"clouds accompanied with lightning. Thereupon the night-ranger Mahodara,"
10533,SECTION LXLVIII.,"inflamed with ire, hurled at Sugriva, the club flaming like the Sun. And"
10534,SECTION LXLVIII.,beholding that dreadful club about to fall the highly powerful
10535,SECTION LXLVIII.,"Sugriva—the lord of monkeys, uplifting his _parigha_ struck it"
10536,SECTION LXLVIII.,"therewith. And the _parigha_, being sundered, fell quickly down on the"
10537,SECTION LXLVIII.,earth. Thereupon the effulgent Sugriva picked up from the ground a
10538,SECTION LXLVIII.,_musala_ made of iron and ornamented with gold. Taking that _musala_ up
10539,SECTION LXLVIII.,he hurled it at the Rākshasa and who again hurled a club; and both of
10540,SECTION LXLVIII.,them being severed fell down on the earth. Having their weapons baffled
10541,SECTION LXLVIII.,"thus, those two heroes, gifted with great prowess and effulgence and"
10542,SECTION LXLVIII.,"resembling the burning fire, were ready to interchange blows. They,"
10543,SECTION LXLVIII.,"emitting roars again and again, struck each other down on the earth with"
10544,SECTION LXLVIII.,their clenched fists. And rising up speedily they again assailed each
10545,SECTION LXLVIII.,"other. Thus those two heroes, unsubdued, struck each other with their"
10546,SECTION LXLVIII.,"arms. Thereupon both of them, highly proficient in fighting with arms,"
10547,SECTION LXLVIII.,were greatly exhausted. Thereupon they took up daggers. And uplifting
10548,SECTION LXLVIII.,"them, (those two heroes) with their persons trembling in ire, proficient"
10549,SECTION LXLVIII.,"in fighting and skilled in the use of weapons, dashed on roaring. And"
10550,SECTION LXLVIII.,"both of them enraged with each other and anxious to score success,"
10551,SECTION LXLVIII.,"moving in a circle on each other’s right side, addressed themselves for"
10552,SECTION LXLVIII.,"action. Thereupon the vicious-minded, heroic Mahodara, gifted with great"
10553,SECTION LXLVIII.,"vehemence and proud of his own heroism, flung his dagger at (the"
10554,SECTION LXLVIII.,monkey’s) armour. And as he was about to extricate his dagger from the
10555,SECTION LXLVIII.,"armour, that foremost of monkeys severed with his dagger that Rākshasa’s"
10556,SECTION LXLVIII.,head with helmet and _kundalas_. And beholding the Rākshasa-chief fall
10557,SECTION LXLVIII.,"down on the earth with his head off, his forces fled away from the"
10558,SECTION LXLVIII.,"field. And slaying him that monkey-chief, delighted, began to roar along"
10559,SECTION LXLVIII.,with other monkeys. There-upon the Ten-necked one became highly enraged
10560,SECTION LXLVIII.,"and Rāghava greatly delighted. And all the Rākshasas, with their hearts"
10561,SECTION LXLVIII.,broken and countenances rendered poorly and stricken with fear fled away
10562,SECTION LXLVIII.,to different quarters. Slaying and striking down on earth Mahodara like
10563,SECTION LXLVIII.,"unto a portion of a mighty hill severed, that son of the Sun appeared"
10564,SECTION LXLVIII.,resplendent in his own effulgence and became irrepressible like unto the
10565,SECTION LXLVIII.,Sun. And winning victory in the action that lord of monkeys was espied

10576,SECTION LXLIX.,"with his weapons, assailed the dreadful army of Angada as well as the"
10577,SECTION LXLIX.,leading monkeys. The Rākshasa severed the heads from the bodies of the
10578,SECTION LXLIX.,monkeys like unto the wind throwing away the fruits from trees. And he
10579,SECTION LXLIX.,"cut off, with his arrows, the arms of some and some were deprived of"
10580,SECTION LXLIX.,their sides. The monkeys were thus assailed by Mahāparshwa with a shower
10581,SECTION LXLIX.,of shafts. All the monkeys were thus stricken with grief and rendered
10582,SECTION LXLIX.,senseless. And hearing of the anxiety of his own army thus assailed by
10583,SECTION LXLIX.,"the Rākshasa, Angada, gifted with great vehemence, taking his _parigha_"
10584,SECTION LXLIX.,"made of iron and resembling the rays of the sun, dashed on like the"

10594,SECTION LXLIX.,"the lord of bears, on his breast with three arrows and assailed Gabāksha"
10595,SECTION LXLIX.,with many shafts. And beholding Jāmbavān and Gabāksha overwhelmed with
10596,SECTION LXLIX.,"arrows, Angada, beside himself with ire, took up a dreadful _parigha_."
10597,SECTION LXLIX.,And holding with two hands that _parigha_ made of iron and bright like
10598,SECTION LXLIX.,"the rays of the sun, Angada, the son of Vāli, with his eyes reddened in"
10599,SECTION LXLIX.,"wrath, hurled it at Mahāparshwa who was stationed at a distance, to slay"
10600,SECTION LXLIX.,"him. And being hurled by the highly powerful (Angada) the _parigha_,"
10601,SECTION LXLIX.,struck down from his hands the bow with arrows and the helmet of the
10602,SECTION LXLIX.,"Rākshasa. And approaching him vehemently, Vāli’s son, gifted with great"
10603,SECTION LXLIX.,"prowess, in anger, struck him, with clenched fist, on his ears having"
10604,SECTION LXLIX.,excellent _kundalas_. There-upon Mahāparshwa gifted with great vehemence
10605,SECTION LXLIX.,"and effulgence, highly angered, took up in his hands a huge"
10606,SECTION LXLIX.,"_parashivadha_, sharpened with oil, bright and hard as iron and"
10607,SECTION LXLIX.,"discharged it at Vāli’s son, and struck him therewith on his left"
10608,SECTION LXLIX.,"shoulder. And Angada baffled that _parashwadha_. Thereupon that hero,"
10609,SECTION LXLIX.,"powerful like his own father, clenching his fist, hard as thunder-bolt"
10610,SECTION LXLIX.,"and resembling even Indra’s _açani_, dealt it, in great anger, upon the"

10612,SECTION LXLIX.,was shattered and lie fell down on earth. He falling down on earth
10613,SECTION LXLIX.,"slain, his soldiers were greatly sorry and Rāvana attained to an excess"
10614,SECTION LXLIX.,of ire in the conflict. The noise set up by the delighted monkeys like
10615,SECTION LXLIX.,"unto a dreadful leonine roar, as if rending the city of Lankā abounding"
10616,SECTION LXLIX.,"in edifices and gates, resembled the great roar of the celestials along"

10618,SECTION LXLIX.,"lord of Rākshasas, the enemy of the gods, in great anger, again"
10619,SECTION LXLIX.,proceeded towards the battle field.

10630,SECTION C.,consequent on all these by slaying Rāma and Lakshmana. I shall destroy

10634,SECTION C.,ten quarters with the sound of his chariot wheels that mighty
10635,SECTION C.,car-warrior proceeded quickly towards Rāghava. With that sound all
10636,SECTION C.,"quarters were filled, and the earth, with rivers, mountains and forests"

10644,SECTION C.,"the monkey-host, that foremost of Rākshasas espied Rāma, unconquered, at"
10645,SECTION C.,"a distance with his brother Lakshmana like unto Bāsava with Vishnu,"
10646,SECTION C.,"holding a huge bow like one painted on the sky, having expansive eyes"

10648,SECTION C.,"the monkeys slain in the encounter and Rāvana approach, the heroic and"
10649,SECTION C.,"highly powerful Rāma, with Sumitrā’s son in his company, delightedly set"
10650,SECTION C.,arrows on his bow. And as if rending the whole earth with that dreadful
10651,SECTION C.,sound he began to draw the string of his excellent bow. With the sound
10652,SECTION C.,of Rāvana’s arrows and the twang of Rāma’s bow hundreds of Rākshasas
10653,SECTION C.,fell down on earth. And coming within the range of the arrows of those
10654,SECTION C.,"two princes, Rāvana appeared like Rāhu in presence of the sun and the"
10655,SECTION C.,moon. And desiring to fight with him first Lakshmana setting sharp
10656,SECTION C.,"arrows on his bow, discharged shafts at him resembling the flame of"

10660,SECTION C.,"with one arrow, severed Lakshmana’s one, with three his three and with"
10661,SECTION C.,"ten his ten. Surpassing thus the son of Sumitrā, Rāvana, ever victorious"
10662,SECTION C.,"in battle, confronted Rāma in the encounter, standing like another hill."
10663,SECTION C.,"And approaching Rāghava, Rāvana the lord of Rākshasas, with his eyes"

10666,SECTION C.,up a _valla_.³⁸⁶ And Rāghava sundered with his sharp _valla_ his
10667,SECTION C.,dreadful arrows flaming and resembling poisonous serpents. With various
10668,SECTION C.,"sharpened arrows Rāghava assailed Rāvana, and he again assailed Rāma in"

10670,SECTION C.,"Uprooting the earth with the vehemence of their arrows, irrepressible by"
10671,SECTION C.,"each other, fighting equally discharging arrows, they looked dreadful"

10673,SECTION C.,"filled with their various weapons, like unto clouds in the rainy season"

10675,SECTION C.,"that shower of arrows, sharpened, shot with great vehemence and winged"

10678,SECTION C.,"dreadful conflict between them, desiring to slay each other, having"
10679,SECTION C.,their prowess unknown and fighting like Vitra and Vāsava. Both of them
10680,SECTION C.,"were proficient in archery, skilled in the art of conflict and foremost"
10681,SECTION C.,of those conversant with the use of weapons. And they began to veer
10682,SECTION C.,"round the battle-field. And wherever they went, there appeared arrows"
10683,SECTION C.,like unto waves of the deep roused by the winds. Then that destroyer of
10684,SECTION C.,"creatures—Rāvana—with his hand engaged in discharging shafts, shot at"
10685,SECTION C.,Rāma’s forehead a network of arrows. And thereat Rāma on his head bore
10686,SECTION C.,"that shower of shafts shot from his terrific bow, having the lustre of"
10687,SECTION C.,"the petals of blue lotuses; nor did he experience any pain, And then"
10688,SECTION C.,"reciting a formula, the exceedingly energetic Rāma endowed with prowess,"
10689,SECTION C.,"wrought up with wrath, engaged in incessantly shooting his shafts,"
10690,SECTION C.,"taking his Raudra weapon and again seizing his arrows, discharged them"
10691,SECTION C.,at that lord of Rākshasas. And alighting at the impenetrable hail of the

10693,SECTION C.,"then occasion him any pain. Again Rāma skilled in all weapons, from a"
10694,SECTION C.,powerful weapon discharged arrows at the sovereign of the Rākshasas
10695,SECTION C.,"mounted on his car. And piercing Rāvana, those like unto five-hooded"
10696,SECTION C.,"serpents, resisted by him, entered the earth, hissing. Having baffled"
10697,SECTION C.,"Rāghava’s weapon, Rāvana, transported with passion, took up a dreadful"
10698,SECTION C.,Asura weapon; and discharged sharpened shafts having the faces of lions
10699,SECTION C.,"and tigers, and the faces of _kankas_ and _kokas_³⁸⁷ and the faces of"
10700,SECTION C.,"vultures and hawks, and the faces of jackals, and the faces of"
10701,SECTION C.,"wolves,—with gaping mouths,—and terrific of aspect; five-mouthed and"
10702,SECTION C.,"red-hued. And that highly powerful one, enraged, sighing like a snake,"
10703,SECTION C.,by his power of illusion shot at Rāma other keen arrows having the faces
10704,SECTION C.,"of mules and the faces of bears, and the faces of dogs and cocks, and"
10705,SECTION C.,"the faces of _makaras_³⁸⁸ and venomous serpents,—these as well as"
10706,SECTION C.,"others. Covered with that Asura weapon, that foremost of the Raghus,"
10707,SECTION C.,"himself resembling fire, discharged an exceedingly vigorous weapon"
10708,SECTION C.,informed with fire; and shot various shafts having faces filled with
10709,SECTION C.,"live flames, and faces like unto suns,—and hued like unto planets and"
10710,SECTION C.,"stars,—and furnished with faces resembling mighty meteors, or resembling"
10711,SECTION C.,"tongues of lightning. And those terrific shafts of Rāvana, resisted by"
10712,SECTION C.,"Rāghava’s weapon, were annihilated in the sky, and destroyed (monkeys)"
10713,SECTION C.,by thousands. And seeing that weapon (of Rāvana) destroyed by Rāma of

10735,SECTION CI.,"from wrath set about discharging at Rāghava a dreadful Raudra weapon,"
10736,SECTION CI.,which had been conferred on him by Maya. And from his bow began to issue
10737,SECTION CI.,"forth in large numbers darts and maces and clubs, flaming and having the"
10738,SECTION CI.,might of thunder; and various kinds of sharp clubs and daggers and
10739,SECTION CI.,nooses and flaming thunderbolts began to descend like unto the winds at
10740,SECTION CI.,the universal tumbling. And thereupon the graceful and exceedingly
10741,SECTION CI.,effulgent Rāghava—foremost of those accomplished in noble arms—resisted
10742,SECTION CI.,that weapon with a powerful Gāndharva weapon. On that weapon being
10743,SECTION CI.,"baffled by the high-souled Rāghava, Rāvana, with his eyes rendered"
10744,SECTION CI.,"coppery with passion, took up a Solar weapon. Thereupon from the bow of"
10745,SECTION CI.,the wondrous vehement and intelligent Ten-necked one rushed out discuses
10746,SECTION CI.,flaming and mighty. And the firmament all round blazed up with those
10747,SECTION CI.,"impendent (arms), as blaze up the cardinal quarters on the Sun and the"
10748,SECTION CI.,Moon and the planets dropping down. Thereat Rāghava in the van of that
10749,SECTION CI.,army by means of vollies of shafts cut off Rāvana’s wonderful weapons
10750,SECTION CI.,"and discuses. And seeing that weapon destroyed, Rāvana—lord of"
10751,SECTION CI.,Rākshasas—with ten arrows pierced Rāma all through his vitals. And
10752,SECTION CI.,"pierced by Rāvana with those ten shafts discharged from his mighty bow,"
10753,SECTION CI.,the exceedingly powerful Rāghava did not so much shake. Then
10754,SECTION CI.,"Rāghava—victor in fight—waxing wondrous wroth, with countless shafts"
10755,SECTION CI.,pierced Rāvana all over his person. In the meanwhile Rāghava’s younger
10756,SECTION CI.,"brother, the mighty Lakshmana—destroyer of foes—growing enraged, took up"
10757,SECTION CI.,seven arrows. And with those highly impetuous arrows that exceedingly
10758,SECTION CI.,effulgent one severed the human-headed standard of Rāvana. And the
10759,SECTION CI.,mighty and graceful Lakshmana with a shaft cut off the head of the
10760,SECTION CI.,"Nairita’s charioteer, illumined with ear-rings. And then with five"
10761,SECTION CI.,"sharpened arrows Lakshmana severed the bow of the Rākshasa-chief,"
10762,SECTION CI.,"resembling the trunk of an elephant. And Bibhishana, bounding up, with"
10763,SECTION CI.,"his mace despatched Rāvana’s excellent steeds, resembling hills or"
10764,SECTION CI.,"dark-blue clouds. Thereat, leaping down from his mighty car, whose"
10765,SECTION CI.,"horses had been slain, Rāvana was fired with high wrath against his"
10766,SECTION CI.,brother. And the powerful lord of Rākshasas endowed with immense
10767,SECTION CI.,"strength, hurled at Bibhishana a dart resembling the flaming"
10768,SECTION CI.,"thunder-bolt. And ere the dart had reached its destination, Lakshmana"
10769,SECTION CI.,severed it with three shafts; and thereat in that mighty conflict there
10770,SECTION CI.,arose a mighty uproar from the monkeys. And the dart dight with networks
10771,SECTION CI.,"of gold fell down in three fragments, as droppeth a mighty meteor from"
10772,SECTION CI.,"the firmament, flaming and shooting out scintillations. Then (Rāvana)"
10773,SECTION CI.,"took up a huge dart, glowing in its own energy, celebrated as being"
10774,SECTION CI.,"irrisistible, and incapable of being borne by the Destroyer himself. On"
10775,SECTION CI.,"being whirled by the impious and strong Rāvana, the dart possessed of"
10776,SECTION CI.,"exceeding energy, flamed up. In the meanwhile the heroic Lakshmana"
10777,SECTION CI.,"swiftly came to the side of Bibhishana,³⁸⁹ whose life was placed in"
10778,SECTION CI.,"peril. And in order to save him, that hero—Lakshmana—drawing his bow,"
10779,SECTION CI.,covered the dart-handed Rāvana with showers of shafts. On being covered
10780,SECTION CI.,"with arrows shot by that high souled one, Rāvana, with his prowess"
10781,SECTION CI.,"baffled, made up his mind to let (his brother) go. And seeing his"
10782,SECTION CI.,"brother delivered by Lakshmana, Rāvana, facing Lakshmana, spoke these"
10783,SECTION CI.,"words,—""O thou proud of thy prowess! as Bibhishana hath this wise been"
10784,SECTION CI.,"delivered by thee, passing by the Rākshasa, this dart, discharged from"
10785,SECTION CI.,"my bludgeon of an arm, will depart, depriving thee of thy life"". Having"
10786,SECTION CI.,"said this, Rāvana, waxing furiously enraged, discharged at Lakshmana"
10787,SECTION CI.,"that dart forged by Maya with his power of illusion, furnished with"
10788,SECTION CI.,"eight bells, having mighty sounds,—incapable of being"
10789,SECTION CI.,"resisted,—competent to finish foes; and flaming in energy,—and shouted"
10790,SECTION CI.,"simultaneously. And hurled with terrific force, the dart sending sounds"
10791,SECTION CI.,"resembling that of Vajra or the thunder-bolt, vehemently alighted at"
10792,SECTION CI.,"Lakshmana in that encounter. Thereat, as the dart descended, Rāghava"
10793,SECTION CI.,"addressed³⁹⁰ it, saying,—""Peace be to Lakshmana! Be thou frustrated; and"
10794,SECTION CI.,"let thy energy go out of thee"". But the dart discharged in the encounter"
10795,SECTION CI.,"by the enraged Rāvana, resembling a venomous serpent, dived into the"
10796,SECTION CI.,dauntless and heroic Lakshmana; and (the dart) exceedingly splendid and
10797,SECTION CI.,"blazing, possessed of dreadful impetuosity; and resembling the tongue of"
10798,SECTION CI.,"the king of serpents, smote Lakshmana in his mighty chest. And with his"
10799,SECTION CI.,"breast riven by the dart, driving deep through the force of Rāvana,"
10800,SECTION CI.,"Lakshmana fell down to the earth. And Rāghava, standing by, seeing"
10801,SECTION CI.,"Lakshmana in that plight, had his heart overspread with sorrow. But"
10802,SECTION CI.,"reflecting only for a while, he, with his eyes surcharged with tears,"
10803,SECTION CI.,"was filled with greater martial ardour, and resembled the fire risen at"
10804,SECTION CI.,"the universal dissolution. Then thinking,—’This is not the time to"
10805,SECTION CI.,"indulge in grief;’ he, gazing at Lakshmana, entered into a terrific"
10806,SECTION CI.,"encounter, resolved upon slaying Rāvana, laying under contribution his"
10807,SECTION CI.,dearest energies. And Rāma saw Lakshmana with his chest riven by the
10808,SECTION CI.,"dart in the mighty conflict, lying drenched in blood, and resembling a"
10809,SECTION CI.,"hill with serpents present in it—And in spite of all their efforts, the"
10810,SECTION CI.,foremost monkeys failed to extract the dart which had been hurled by the
10811,SECTION CI.,"powerful Rāvana.—And, further, they were (all the while) sore assailed"
10812,SECTION CI.,"with showers of shafts by the foremost Rākshasa of them all. The dart,"
10813,SECTION CI.,"having pierced Sumitrā’s son, had entered the earth. In the encounter"
10814,SECTION CI.,"the mighty Rāma, grasping the dreadful dart with his hands, extracted"
10815,SECTION CI.,the same and wrathfully snapped it.³⁹¹ As he (Rāma) was engaged in
10816,SECTION CI.,"pulling the dart out, the mighty Rāvana kept pouring marrow-piercing"
10817,SECTION CI.,"shafts all over his person. Thinking nothing of those arrows, Rāma,"
10818,SECTION CI.,"embracing Lakshmana, spoke unto Hanumān and the mighty monkey,"
10819,SECTION CI.,"Sugriva,—""Ye foremost of monkeys, do ye stay here, surrounding"
10820,SECTION CI.,Lakshmana. The opportunity for putting forth my prowess which I had
10821,SECTION CI.,"sought, is present. I shall slay this wicked-minded Ten-necked one, who"
10822,SECTION CI.,is resolved to pursue the course of unrighteousness. Even as on the
10823,SECTION CI.,"expiry of summer the Chātaka is eager for the sight of clouds, I had"

10825,SECTION CI.,"unto you,—this very hour not long after ye will see this world without"
10826,SECTION CI.,"Rāvana or Rāma. To-day having slain Rāvana in battle, I shall renounce"
10827,SECTION CI.,"all sorrow arising from the loss of my kingdom, from my sojourn in the"
10828,SECTION CI.,"woods, from my wandering in Dandaka, from the ravishment of Vaidehi,"
10829,SECTION CI.,"from encounter with the Rakshas,—all the terrible evils that I have"
10830,SECTION CI.,"suffered, and all the troubles resembling hell. He for whom I have"
10831,SECTION CI.,"brought over the monkey-forces, made Sugriva king, slaying Vāli in"
10832,SECTION CI.,"battle, for whom I have crossed the ocean and constructed a bridge over"
10833,SECTION CI.,"the deep—the same hath been come at by me in conflict, and the same hath"
10834,SECTION CI.,"come within the range of my vision.—And having come within my ken,"
10835,SECTION CI.,"Rāvana will not live, even as one coming within ken of a serpent of"
10836,SECTION CI.,"poisonous sight, doth not live; or even as a serpent doth not live,"
10837,SECTION CI.,"coming within ken of Vinatā’s³⁹² son. Do ye, ye irrepressible ones, ye"
10838,SECTION CI.,"foremost of monkeys, seated at the brow of the mountain, behold the"
10839,SECTION CI.,battle between me and Rāvana. To day let the three worlds with the
10840,SECTION CI.,"Gandharvas, and the Siddhas, and the Chiranas, see that for which Rāma"
10841,SECTION CI.,is Rāma. To-day I shall do a deed of which the worlds with the mobile
10842,SECTION CI.,"and the immobile and the gods, shall speak as long as the Earth"
10843,SECTION CI.,"sustaineth (creatures.)"" Having delivered himself thus, Rāma,"
10844,SECTION CI.,"concentrating his attention, began to charge the Ten-necked one in"
10845,SECTION CI.,encounter with whetted arrows decked with burnished gold. And in the
10846,SECTION CI.,"same way Rāvana showered on Rāma great _nārāchas_ and clubs, even as"
10847,SECTION CI.,clouds pour down showers. And there arose a tremendous uproar of mighty
10848,SECTION CI.,"arrows discharged by Rāma and Rāvana, smiting one another. And the"
10849,SECTION CI.,"shafts shot by Rāma and Rāvana, severed and scattered, with flaming"
10850,SECTION CI.,heads dropped to the Earth. And the mighty twangs of the bow-strings of
10851,SECTION CI.,"both, terrifying all creatures, were wonderful to behold.³⁹³ And then"
10852,SECTION CI.,"even as clouds disperse on being trampled by the Winds, Rāvana, covered"
10853,SECTION CI.,with showers of arrowy networks by that high souled one and reduced to
10854,SECTION CI.,"sore straits by that one (Rāma) of a glowing bow, fled away in fear."

10888,SECTION CII.,dimmed with tears; my limbs weaken as do those of men in a dream;
10889,SECTION CII.,"thought racks me; and I even desire death"". Seeing his brother wounded"
10890,SECTION CII.,"by the wicked-minded Rāvana, crying in preternatural accents, and sore"
10891,SECTION CII.,"stricken in his vitals, (Rāma) overcome by a mighty sorrow, lamented"
10892,SECTION CII.,"with his senses wildered. ""Seeing my brother, Lakshmana, wounded, and"
10893,SECTION CII.,"lying over the dust of the field, even victory, O hero, doth not seem to"
10894,SECTION CII.,"me sweet. If the Moon is hid from the sight, whom doth he then delight?"
10895,SECTION CII.,What have I to do with battle? What have I to do with life? I have no
10896,SECTION CII.,"more to do anything with fighting, seeing that this Lakshmana wounded,"
10897,SECTION CII.,lieth in the field of battle. As this highly effulgent one had followed
10898,SECTION CII.,"me into the forest, so will I in the same way follow him to the abode of"
10899,SECTION CII.,"Yama. Ever seeking my welfare and ever devoted to me, he hath been"
10900,SECTION CII.,reduced to this pass by Rākshasas fighting in crooked ways. In land
10901,SECTION CII.,"after land one meets with wives, in land after land one meets with"
10902,SECTION CII.,"friends, but country find I none where a uterine brother may be met"
10903,SECTION CII.,"with. What, O irrepressible one, shall I do with the kingdom without my"
10904,SECTION CII.,"Lakshmana? And what shall I say unto mother Sumitrā, fond of her son?"
10905,SECTION CII.,And I shall never be able to bear the reproach Sumitrā shall cast upon
10906,SECTION CII.,"me. And what shall I say unto Kauçalyā, and what unto mother Kaikeyi?"
10907,SECTION CII.,"And what shall I say unto Bharata, and what unto the exceedingly"
10908,SECTION CII.,powerful Satrughna? ’Thou hadst gone to the woods with him. Why then
10909,SECTION CII.,dost thou come (back) without him?’ ’Tis better (for me) to renounce my
10910,SECTION CII.,"life here, instead of bearing the censure of friends. What a sin had I"
10911,SECTION CII.,"committed in another birth, seeing that my virtuous brother, staying"
10912,SECTION CII.,"before me, hath been slain? Ah, my brother! Thou best of men! O master,"
10913,SECTION CII.,"who wert the foremost of heroes! Why, forsaking me, dost thou repair to"
10914,SECTION CII.,"the other regions. Wherefore, brother, dost thou not speak to me, who am"
10915,SECTION CII.,lamenting? Get up. See! Why dost thou lie down? Look on me with thine
10916,SECTION CII.,"eyes. O mighty-armed one, in the woods and mountains thou didst ever use"
10917,SECTION CII.,"to cheer me, tried by grief and pining in despondency, with my mind"
10918,SECTION CII.,"overwhelmed (with woe)"". As Rāma was speaking thus with his senses"
10919,SECTION CII.,"overwhelmed with emotion, Sushena, soothing him, spoke these pregnant"
10920,SECTION CII.,"words,—""O foremost of men, cast off this train of thought tending to"
10921,SECTION CII.,"overwhelm thy understanding,—this anxiety giving birth to grief, and"
10922,SECTION CII.,resembling the shafts of foes in the van of the embattled forces.
10923,SECTION CII.,Lakshmana enhancer of auspiciousness is not dead. His face is not
10924,SECTION CII.,"distorted or blackened. Do thou look at his countenance, which is"
10925,SECTION CII.,beautifully bright and cheerful. His hands have palms resembling
10926,SECTION CII.,"lotus-petals, and his eyes are pleasant. O king, one dead doth not look"
10927,SECTION CII.,"thus. (Therefore), O hero, do not grieve. O subduer of enemies, this one"
10928,SECTION CII.,"is instinct with life. As he is lying down on the ground, stretched at"
10929,SECTION CII.,"length, his heart, O hero, trembling momentarily, testifieth to his"
10930,SECTION CII.,"respiration"". Having spoken thus unto Rāghava, the highly wise Sushena"
10931,SECTION CII.,"thus addressed the mighty monkey, Hanumān, saying,—""O placid one, hieing"
10932,SECTION CII.,"hence to the mountain, Mahodaya, which, O hero, had formerly been"
10933,SECTION CII.,"mentioned unto thee by Jāmbavān, bring hither the mighty drug sprung at"
10934,SECTION CII.,"its right summit—Viçalyakaranī by name, and Sāvarnyakaranī,³⁹⁴ and"
10935,SECTION CII.,"Sanjīvakaranī, O hero, and the potent medicine—Sandhānī. Do thou bring"
10936,SECTION CII.,"(these) in order that the hero—Lakshmana—may be revived"". Having been"
10937,SECTION CII.,"thus instructed, Hanumān, repairing to the Medicinal mountain, was"
10938,SECTION CII.,"wrought up with anxiety, not knowing the drugs. And then the thought"
10939,SECTION CII.,sprang up in the mind of the Wind-god’s offspring of immeasurable
10940,SECTION CII.,"prowess,—""I shall go, even taking this (entire) summit of the mountain."
10941,SECTION CII.,"In this very summit must that delightful drug have sprung. This I infer,"
10942,SECTION CII.,inasmuch as Sushena had forsooth said so. If I fail to take
10943,SECTION CII.,"Viçalyakaranī, I shall come by disgrace,—and if I spend much time (in"
10944,SECTION CII.,"thought), that would be fraught with evil"".³⁹⁵ Having reflected thus,"
10945,SECTION CII.,"the exceedingly powerful Hanumān, foremost of monkeys,—swiftly drawing"
10946,SECTION CII.,"up to that best of mountains, and giving three shakes to the mountain"
10947,SECTION CII.,"filled with various flowering trees,—raised it up with his hands. And"
10948,SECTION CII.,taking that summit of the mountain resembling dark-blue clouds charged
10949,SECTION CII.,"with rain, Hanumān from the earth bounded up into the sky. And arriving"
10950,SECTION CII.,"(at his quarters), that wondrous vehement one, putting down the"
10951,SECTION CII.,"mountain-peak, and reposing for a while, spoke unto Sushena,—""I did not"
10952,SECTION CII.,"find the drug, O best of monkeys; and therefore have I brought this"
10953,SECTION CII.,"entire summit of the mountain"". When the Wind-god’s offspring had spoken"
10954,SECTION CII.,"thus, that foremost of monkeys—Sushena—praising him, uprooted the herb"
10955,SECTION CII.,"and secured it. Seeing Hanumān’s feat, incapable of being done by even"
10956,SECTION CII.,"the celestials, the choicest of the monkeys were amazed. Then crushing"
10957,SECTION CII.,"the healing herb, that best of monkeys—the exceedingly effulgent"
10958,SECTION CII.,"Sushena, made Lakshmana smell the same. And thereupon the wounded"
10959,SECTION CII.,"Lakshmana,—slayer of hostile heroes—smelling it, cured of his wound and"
10960,SECTION CII.,"ailments, speedily rose up from the ground. Seeing Lakshmana rise up"
10961,SECTION CII.,"from the earth, the monkeys, exceedingly rejoiced, honoring Lakshmana,"
10962,SECTION CII.,"exclaimed, ""Excellent! Excellent!"" ""Come!"" said that slayer of hostile"
10963,SECTION CII.,"heroes—Rāma—and with his eyes filled with tears, he deeply embraced"
10964,SECTION CII.,"Lakshmana. And having embraced Sumitrā’s son, Rāghava then addressed"
10965,SECTION CII.,"him, saying—""By good fortune it is that, O hero, I see thee returned"
10966,SECTION CII.,"from (the mansion of) Death.—Verily my life, or Sitā, or Victory is"
10967,SECTION CII.,"worthless (without thee). And thou being dead, what is my life worth?"""
10968,SECTION CII.,"When the high-souled Rāghava had spoken thus, Lakshmana, aggrieved on"
10969,SECTION CII.,"account of the words (of Rāghava) expressive of infirmity of purpose,"
10970,SECTION CII.,"said,—""Having bound thyself by that vow, it doth not, O thou having"
10971,SECTION CII.,"truth for prowess, behove thee to speak like one fickle and feeble."
10972,SECTION CII.,"Those speaking the truth, never falsify their promise: the mark of a"
10973,SECTION CII.,"great one is even observance of vow. O sinless one, do not suffer"
10974,SECTION CII.,thyself to be overcome by despair on my account. Do thou to-day by
10975,SECTION CII.,"slaying Rāvana, make thy promise good. Thy foe coming within the sway of"
10976,SECTION CII.,"thy shafts, will not hence, living, even like a mighty elephant coming"
10977,SECTION CII.,before a sharp-toothed roaring lion. I wish the speedy destruction of
10978,SECTION CII.,"this impious one, ere the maker of day, having performed his work, has"
10979,SECTION CII.,"ascended the Setting-hill.³⁹⁶ If thou wishest to slay Rāvana in battle,"
10980,SECTION CII.,"if thou desirest to recover the princess, then, O noble one, O hero,"
10981,SECTION CII.,"to-day speedily set about what I say""."

10997,SECTION CIII.,"Hearing the words uttered by Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile"
10998,SECTION CIII.,"heroes—Rāghava—endued with prowess, taking his bow, set shafts on it,"
10999,SECTION CIII.,and in the brunt of battle began to discharge dreadful arrows at Rāvana.
11000,SECTION CIII.,"And mounted on another car, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—rushed against"
11001,SECTION CIII.,"Kākutstha, even as Swarbhānu rusheth against the Sun. And even as a mass"
11002,SECTION CIII.,"of clouds poureth down torrents on a mighty mountain, the Ten-necked"
11003,SECTION CIII.,"one, mounted on his car, smote Rāma with shafts resembling"
11004,SECTION CIII.,"thunder-bolts. And in the encounter Rāma, concentrating his thoughts,"
11005,SECTION CIII.,showered on the Ten-necked one arrows embellished with gold and looking
11006,SECTION CIII.,like living fire. And celestials and Gandharvas and Kinnaras declared
11007,SECTION CIII.,that there had been no other battle like unto the encounter of Rāma
11008,SECTION CIII.,stationed on the ground and the Raksha mounted on his car. Then the
11009,SECTION CIII.,"foremost of celestials—Sakra—hearing their ambrosial speech, summoning"
11010,SECTION CIII.,"Mātali, said,—""Taking my car, hie to the best of the Raghus. And"
11011,SECTION CIII.,"reaching the earth, do thou, welcoming (him), bring about great good"
11012,SECTION CIII.,"unto the gods"". Thus accosted by the sovereign of the celestials,"
11013,SECTION CIII.,"Mātali—celestial charioteer—bending down his head, addressed that"
11014,SECTION CIII.,"celestial, saying,—""Speedily shall I go, O lord of the celestials; and I"
11015,SECTION CIII.,"shall also do the office of a charioteer (unto Rāghava)"". Then yoking"
11016,SECTION CIII.,"with steeds that best of cars, curiously wrought with gold; adorned with"
11017,SECTION CIII.,hundreds of small bells; resembling the Sun new risen; having its pole
11018,SECTION CIII.,studded with lapises; yoked with excellent horses caparisoned in gold;
11019,SECTION CIII.,"furnished with white chowris,—drawn by steeds resembling the Sun; decked"
11020,SECTION CIII.,"with golden net-works,—and provided with a golden standard,—the graceful"
11021,SECTION CIII.,"car of the sovereign of the celestials,—Mātali, commanded by the king of"
11022,SECTION CIII.,"the immortals, ascending the car, went out of the celestial regions and"
11023,SECTION CIII.,"came to Kākutstha. And with his hand holding the reins, the charioteer"
11024,SECTION CIII.,"of the thousand-eyed (Deity) with joined hands addressed Rāma,"
11025,SECTION CIII.,"saying,—""O Kākutstha, in order that thou mayst obtain the victory, the"
11026,SECTION CIII.,"thousand-eyed (god) hath sent thee this car. And, O exceedingly powerful"
11027,SECTION CIII.,one! O graceful (hero)! thou that slayest thy foes! this is the
11028,SECTION CIII.,"redoubtable bow of Indra,—and this is the mail resembling fire,—and"
11029,SECTION CIII.,these are the arrows looking like the very Sun; and this is the dart
11030,SECTION CIII.,"shining and fraught with fair fortune. Ascend thou this car, O hero."
11031,SECTION CIII.,"Slay the Rākshasa—Rāvana, with me as thy charioteer, even as the lord of"
11032,SECTION CIII.,"the celestials slayeth Dānavas"". Thus addressed, Rāma, going round the"
11033,SECTION CIII.,"car and saluting it, ascended the same, illumining the worlds with his"
11034,SECTION CIII.,splendour. And the encounter that took place between the two cars with
11035,SECTION CIII.,"the mighty-armed Rāma (on one side), and the Raksha—Rāvana—(on the"
11036,SECTION CIII.,"other), was wonderful to behold. And Rāghava highly proficient in"
11037,SECTION CIII.,weapons with a Gāndharva weapon resisted the Gāndharva weapon of the
11038,SECTION CIII.,"Rākshasa king, and with a celestial weapon, his celestial weapon. And"
11039,SECTION CIII.,"then that lord of Rākshasas—the night-ranger—fired with high rage, again"
11040,SECTION CIII.,discharged an exceedingly dreadful Rākshasa weapon. And the gold-decked
11041,SECTION CIII.,"shafts shot from Rāvana’s bow, becoming furiously venomous serpents,"
11042,SECTION CIII.,"covered Kākutstha. And vomitting living flames, they of terrific aspect,"
11043,SECTION CIII.,"having flaming faces, showered over Rāma with gaping mouths. And those"
11044,SECTION CIII.,"flaming venomous serpents, having the feel of Vāsuki himself, covered"
11045,SECTION CIII.,all sides and enveloped all quarters. And seeing those serpents
11046,SECTION CIII.,"descending in the encounter, Rāma employed a dreadful Gāruda weapon. And"
11047,SECTION CIII.,"discharged from Rāghava’s bow, those arrows plated with gold at the"
11048,SECTION CIII.,"feathered parts, and furnished with the splendour of peacocks, becoming"
11049,SECTION CIII.,golden birds—began to range (the field of battle) as the enemies of the
11050,SECTION CIII.,"serpents. And the shafts of Rāma capable of wearing forms at will,"
11051,SECTION CIII.,"turned into birds, destroyed all the exceedingly swift-coursing arrows"
11052,SECTION CIII.,"having the forms of serpents. On his weapon having been baffled,"
11053,SECTION CIII.,"Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—waxing Wroth, poured tremendous showers of"
11054,SECTION CIII.,shafts on Rāma. And smiting Rāma of untiring deeds with thousands of
11055,SECTION CIII.,"shafts, (Rāvana) pierced Mātali with vollies of arrows. And with an"
11056,SECTION CIII.,"arrow, Rāvana severed the standard; and having brought down the golden"
11057,SECTION CIII.,"standard on the floor of the car, Rāvana wounded even Indra’s steeds"
11058,SECTION CIII.,"with a net-work of arrows. And seeing Rāma hard pressed, celestials and"
11059,SECTION CIII.,"Gandharvas, and Chāranas along with Dānavas, and Siddhas, and the"
11060,SECTION CIII.,supreme saints were overcome with sadness; and the foremost monkeys
11061,SECTION CIII.,together with Bihhishana were aggrieved. And seeing a Moon of Rāma
11062,SECTION CIII.,"Chandra in the grasp of a Rāhu of Rāvana, that bringer of evil unto"
11063,SECTION CIII.,"creatures—Budha—stood, assailing the Prayāpatya star—Rohini—beloved of"
11064,SECTION CIII.,"the Moon. And the enraged Ocean, heaving with smoking surges, and"
11065,SECTION CIII.,"flaming as it were, swelled up, seeming to the touch the Sun. And the"
11066,SECTION CIII.,"Sun was blackened and assumed a stern aspect, with his rays dimmed. And"
11067,SECTION CIII.,"he was seen with a headless trunk on his lap, and he was in conjunction"
11068,SECTION CIII.,"with a comet. And that star of the Koçalas, relating to the"
11069,SECTION CIII.,"deities—Indra and Agni—Angaraka—stood in the sky, attacking Viçākhā. And"
11070,SECTION CIII.,"the Ten-necked one, having ten faces and twenty arms, equipped with his"
11071,SECTION CIII.,"bow, looked like the mountain—Maināka. And Rāma reduced to sore straits"
11072,SECTION CIII.,"by the Ten-necked Raksha, could not discharge his arrows in the"
11073,SECTION CIII.,"conflict. And then the enraged Rāma with his eyes slightly red, flew"
11074,SECTION CIII.,"into a tremendous passion, as if burning up the Rākshasas. Seeing the"
11075,SECTION CIII.,"face of the enraged Rāma endued with understanding, all the creatures"
11076,SECTION CIII.,were overwhelmed with fear and the Earth herself shook. And mountains
11077,SECTION CIII.,"abounding with lions and tigers began to tremble, and trees to shiver."
11078,SECTION CIII.,And even the deep—lord of streams—was wrought up wondrously. And rough
11079,SECTION CIII.,and terrific clouds in the sky sent forth fierce roars. And stormy
11080,SECTION CIII.,clouds rumbling went about the heavens. And seeing Rāma wrought up with
11081,SECTION CIII.,"a mighty passion, and the fearful disastrous omens, all creatures were"
11082,SECTION CIII.,possessed by fright and Rāvana was struck with dismay. And then
11083,SECTION CIII.,"stationed in the sky, celestials and Gandharvas and mighty serpents and"
11084,SECTION CIII.,saints and Dānavas and Daityas and those related to Gāruda—fowls—beheld
11085,SECTION CIII.,"that conflict like unto the universal tumbling, as the two heroes fought"
11086,SECTION CIII.,"on with various dire arms. And as they looked on the mighty encounter,"
11087,SECTION CIII.,"the celestials and the Asuras, who had come to the conflict, from"
11088,SECTION CIII.,feeling of regard³⁹⁷ cheerfully spoke (these words). And the Asuras
11089,SECTION CIII.,"staying there said unto the Ten-necked one, ’Be victorious!’ and the"
11090,SECTION CIII.,"celestials again and again said unto Rāma, ’Be victorious!’ In the"
11091,SECTION CIII.,"meantime, the impious Rāvana, desirous of slaying Rāghava, from wrath"
11092,SECTION CIII.,"took up a mighty weapon, fraught with the essence of the thunder-bolt;"
11093,SECTION CIII.,"sending terrible sounds; capable of destroying all foes,—furnished with"
11094,SECTION CIII.,forks resembling mountain-peaks; tending to strike terror unto mind and
11095,SECTION CIII.,"sight; sharp-pointed, resembling the smoking fire risen at the hour of"
11096,SECTION CIII.,universal dissolution; exceedingly terrible; irrisistible (in battle);
11097,SECTION CIII.,"unbearable even by the Destroyer,—the terror of all creatures—terrific;"
11098,SECTION CIII.,"and competent to rive (all things). Flaming up with wrath, Rāvana took"
11099,SECTION CIII.,"this dart. And fired with furious wrath, that powerful one took the dart"
11100,SECTION CIII.,"in the encounter, surrounded in that contest by many heroic Rākshasas."
11101,SECTION CIII.,"And uplifting (the dart), the huge-bodied Rāvana, with his eyes reddened"
11102,SECTION CIII.,"in passion, emitted mighty roars. And the shouts of the Rākshasa"
11103,SECTION CIII.,sovereign made the earth and the sky and the cardinal quarters and all
11104,SECTION CIII.,sides tremble. And at the roars of that wicked-minded and huge-bodied
11105,SECTION CIII.,"one, all creatures were struck with terror, and the sea was vexed.³⁹⁸"
11106,SECTION CIII.,"And the exceedingly energetic Rāvana, taking that mighty dart, and"
11107,SECTION CIII.,"sending up furious shouts, addressed Rāma in a harsh speech, saying,—""O"
11108,SECTION CIII.,"Rāma, I in wrath uplift this dart having the strength of the levin. This"
11109,SECTION CIII.,will utterly deprive of life thee who art assisted by thy brother. O
11110,SECTION CIII.,"thou that delightest in battle, to-day swiftly slaying thee, I shall"
11111,SECTION CIII.,make thee even with those heroic Rakshas slain in the van of the forces.
11112,SECTION CIII.,"Stay now. O Rāghava, thee shall I slay with this dart"". Saying this, the"
11113,SECTION CIII.,lord of the Rākshasas hurled the dart. And discharged from Rāvana’s
11114,SECTION CIII.,"hand, (the dart), surrounded with garlands of lightning, furnished with"
11115,SECTION CIII.,"eight bells, sending mighty roars,—rising to the sky, looked exceedingly"
11116,SECTION CIII.,"splendid. Seeing the dart, flaming and of terrific aspect, Raghu’s"
11117,SECTION CIII.,"son—Rāma—endowed with prowess, drawing his bow, discharged arrows. And"
11118,SECTION CIII.,"with vollies of shafts Rāghava resisted the descending (dart), even as"
11119,SECTION CIII.,Vāsava extinguished the fire of doomsday with his showers. Then even as
11120,SECTION CIII.,"a flame consumeth insects, the mighty dart of Rāvana burnt up those"
11121,SECTION CIII.,shafts shot from the bow of Rāma. Seeing those shafts reduced to ashes
11122,SECTION CIII.,"and crushed on coming in contact with the dart, as they were coursing in"
11123,SECTION CIII.,"the sky, Rāghava was transported with passion. And then waxing wondrous"
11124,SECTION CIII.,"wroth,—Raghu’s son—Rāghava—took up a javelin, liked by Vāsava himself,"
11125,SECTION CIII.,"brought by Mātali. And on being wielded by that strong one, the javelin,"
11126,SECTION CIII.,"resonant with bells, made the welkin blaze up, like a burning meteor on"
11127,SECTION CIII.,"the occasion of universal rack. And when hurled, it alighted on that"
11128,SECTION CIII.,"same dart of the Rākshasa-chief. And thereat, with its splendour lost,"
11129,SECTION CIII.,"the mighty dart, riven, dropped (to the earth.) Then Rāma, shooting"
11130,SECTION CIII.,"straight-speeding arrows, pierced his (Rāvana’s) exceedingly fleet"
11131,SECTION CIII.,steeds. And then he pierced Rāvana in the chest with whetted arrows. And
11132,SECTION CIII.,the energetic Rāghava hit (Rāvana) in the temples with three feathered
11133,SECTION CIII.,"shafts. And thereat with all his limbs pierced (with arrows), and his"
11134,SECTION CIII.,"body laved in blood, the lord of Rākshasas furnished with many limbs,"
11135,SECTION CIII.,looked like a flowering Açoka. And with his person pierced with the
11136,SECTION CIII.,"shafts of Rāma, the lord of night-rangers having his body drenched with"
11137,SECTION CIII.,"blood, was stricken with sadness in the midst of his forces,—and was"

11157,SECTION CIV.,"stood in the field, resisting those networks of arrows, and took up"
11158,SECTION CIV.,shafts resembling the rays of the Sun. Then the fleet-handed
11159,SECTION CIV.,"night-ranger, fired with rage, discharged a thousand arrows at the chest"

11167,SECTION CIV.,"hero—Daçaratha’s son—Rāma, overcome with wrath, addressed Rāvana,"
11168,SECTION CIV.,"laughing, in a harsh speech, saying,—""Thou vilest of Rākshasas, in"

11170,SECTION CIV.,"Janasthāna and brought her under thy subjection, thou hast been deprived"
11171,SECTION CIV.,of thy prowess. Having forcibly carried away Vaidehi staying in that
11172,SECTION CIV.,"mighty forest, forlorn and without me, thou thinkest—’I am a hero.’"
11173,SECTION CIV.,"Outraging the helpless wives of others,—doing this craven deed, thou"

11176,SECTION CIV.,"destruction on thyself, thou thinkest,—’I am a hero.’ A great and’"
11177,SECTION CIV.,"famous act hath been performed by thee,—a hero, and the brother of the"
11178,SECTION CIV.,"Bestower of riches, surrounded with thy forces! To-day receive the"
11179,SECTION CIV.,"mighty fruit of that infamous act done through pride, productive of"
11180,SECTION CIV.,"evil.³⁹⁹ O wicked-minded one, thou thinkest of thyself—’I am a hero;’"
11181,SECTION CIV.,"but thou that hast taken away Sitā like a thief, hast no feeling of"
11182,SECTION CIV.,"shame. Hadst thou forcibly outraged Sitā in my very presence, thou,"
11183,SECTION CIV.,"slain by my shafts, wouldst have seen thy brother—Khara. By luck, O thou"
11184,SECTION CIV.,"of an evil soul, thou hast come within the range of my vision. To-day by"
11185,SECTION CIV.,means of sharp shafts shall I bring thee to death’s door. To-day beasts
11186,SECTION CIV.,"of pray will drag thy head having burning ear-rings, severed by my"
11187,SECTION CIV.,"shafts and covered with the dust of the battle-field. O Rāvana, vultures"
11188,SECTION CIV.,"will alight on thy breast, as thou wilt lie low on the ground; and,"
11189,SECTION CIV.,"athirst, they will drink the blood gushing out from thy wounds. To-day"
11190,SECTION CIV.,"fowls of the air will keep pulling at thee pierced with my shafts, and"
11191,SECTION CIV.,"lying lifeless, as birds do serpents"". Having spoken thus, that slayer"
11192,SECTION CIV.,"of foes—Rāma—showered arrows on the lord of Rākshasas, staying before."
11193,SECTION CIV.,And the prowess and strength and spirits and force of arms of Rāma
11194,SECTION CIV.,"burning for the destruction of his foe, were doubled. And all the"

11196,SECTION CIV.,the fleet-handedness of that exceedingly powerful one increased
11197,SECTION CIV.,immensely from exhilaration of spirits. Seeing all these auspicious
11198,SECTION CIV.,"omens coming of themselves, Rāma, finisher of Rākshasas, set about"
11199,SECTION CIV.,smiting his foe more energetically than ever. And assailed with stones
11200,SECTION CIV.,"by the monkeys and showers of shafts by Rāghava, the Ten-necked one felt"
11201,SECTION CIV.,his heart undergoing a revolution.⁴⁰¹ And when through the stupifaction
11202,SECTION CIV.,"of his inner self, he could not discharge any weapon, or draw his bow,"
11203,SECTION CIV.,"or put forth his prowess, (Rāma) did not persist in smiting him. And the"

11205,SECTION CIV.,"last moments were present. And his charioteer, driving his car,"
11206,SECTION CIV.,"perceiving this, calmly took the car away from the field of fight. And"
11207,SECTION CIV.,"then, seeing the king shorn of prowess, and dropt, his charioteer,"

11227,SECTION CV.,"vigor,—as cowardly, light, nerveless and shorn of energy,—and as"

11231,SECTION CV.,enemy? O abject one! by thee have my long-earned renown and energy and
11232,SECTION CV.,prowess and credit been brought to naught. In the very sight of an enemy
11233,SECTION CV.,"of renowned prowess, and one capable of being gratified with valorous"
11234,SECTION CV.,"deeds, hast thou made me, burning for battle, look as if I were a"
11235,SECTION CV.,"coward. As, O wicked-minded one, thou dost not even through"
11236,SECTION CV.,"heedlessness, take the car to the field of battle, I infer for certain"
11237,SECTION CV.,"that thou hast been bribed by the foe. The act that thou hast done, doth"
11238,SECTION CV.,not appear as that of a friend seeking our welfare; but to-day thou hast
11239,SECTION CV.,"acted like an enemy. If thou hast been maintained by me, if thou"
11240,SECTION CV.,"rememberest my merit, do thou swiftly turn the car before my enemy has"
11241,SECTION CV.,"departed"". Thus admonished by him of slender sense, the charioteer"
11242,SECTION CV.,"possessed of intelligence, humbly spake onto Rāvana words fraught with"
11243,SECTION CV.,"good,—""I am not afraid, nor stupified, nor have I been bribed by the"
11244,SECTION CV.,"foe, nor am I negligent. And I have not forgotten thy affection or thy"
11245,SECTION CV.,"good offices. And studious of thy welfare, I have saved thy fame; and"
11246,SECTION CV.,with a mind over-flowing with affection I have done (unto thee) this
11247,SECTION CV.,"unpalatable good. O mighty monarch, for this, thou shouldst not, like a"
11248,SECTION CV.,"frivolous and base one, criminate me that am ever engaged in what is"
11249,SECTION CV.,good and dear unto thee. Listen! I shall render thee reason why I turned
11250,SECTION CV.,"away from the field the car, rushing like a river when the sea is"
11251,SECTION CV.,swelled up.⁴⁰² I knew that thou hadst been fatigued in consequence of
11252,SECTION CV.,thy mighty exertions in the fight. And I could not perceive that thy
11253,SECTION CV.,prowess then stood superior (to that of the foe).⁴⁰³ And the steeds of
11254,SECTION CV.,"my car were worn out by carrying it; and they were battered, and"
11255,SECTION CV.,"helpless, and perspired like kine in a shower. And bad omens fast sprang"
11256,SECTION CV.,"up before us. And on these occurring, I perceived that things would go"
11257,SECTION CV.,"against us. O thou endowed with exceeding might, a charioteer should be"
11258,SECTION CV.,"conversant with season and place, with omens, and the expressions of"
11259,SECTION CV.,"emotions; as also with depression of spirits, exhilaration, and grief."
11260,SECTION CV.,"And he should have a knowledge of low, level and uneven grounds, and the"

11263,SECTION CV.,"near an enemy, when to turn away from him; when to stay; and when to"
11264,SECTION CV.,"turn round from before the foe—all these (he should know). What I, for"
11265,SECTION CV.,"bringing respite unto thee as well as the horses of the car, have done"
11266,SECTION CV.,"by way of removing the terrific exhaustion, is proper. I did not, O"
11267,SECTION CV.,"hero, turn away the car of my own sheer will. What I have done, O lord,"
11268,SECTION CV.,had been dictated by my affection for thee. Command me. What thou
11269,SECTION CV.,"sayest, O destroyer of foes; I will do every way, O hero, with my whole"

11504,SECTION CVII.,"steeds, engarlanded in gold; stocked with war-like implements; furnished"
11505,SECTION CVII.,with ensigns and standards; appearing to devour the welkin; making the
11506,SECTION CVII.,earth herself resound; destructive to hostile hosts; and filling its own
11507,SECTION CVII.,"party with delight. And as it speedily descended, the monarch of men"
11508,SECTION CVII.,"beheld that Rākshasa-king’s resounding car, having huge standards, yoked"
11509,SECTION CVII.,"with black chargers, and endowed with fierce splendour; as if flaming in"

11511,SECTION CVII.,thronging lightning pennons; displaying the glow of Indra’s weapon;⁴⁵⁷
11512,SECTION CVII.,showering arms; and resembling rain-charged clouds. Seeing the enemy’s
11513,SECTION CVII.,car resembling a mass of clouds having a chatter resembling the sounds
11514,SECTION CVII.,"sent by a cleaving mountain rived by the thunder, Rāma, vehemently"
11515,SECTION CVII.,"drawing his bow curved like the infant moon, addressed Mātali—charioteer"
11516,SECTION CVII.,"unto the thousand-eyed (deity),⁴⁵⁸ saying,—""O Mātali, behold the enraged"
11517,SECTION CVII.,chariot of my foe as it courseth on. From the furious speed with which
11518,SECTION CVII.,"he is again wheeling at my right, it appeareth that he hath set his"
11519,SECTION CVII.,heart on slaying me in encounter. Do thou therefore heedfully drive the
11520,SECTION CVII.,car right against the vehicle of my foe. I wish to destroy this one even
11521,SECTION CVII.,as the wind scattereth clouds that have appeared. Do thou with all thy
11522,SECTION CVII.,"wits about thee, without trepidation, and holding thy heart as well as"
11523,SECTION CVII.,"thy eye in calmness, swiftly drive the chariot ruled by the reins."
11524,SECTION CVII.,"Worthy of Purandara’s car, thou ought not to be taught by me. Desirous"
11525,SECTION CVII.,"of encounter and my whole soul bent on fight, I simply remind thee—not"
11526,SECTION CVII.,"teach thee"". Pleased with these words of Rāma, the excellent celestial"
11527,SECTION CVII.,charioteer—Mātali—drove the car. Then leaving Rāvana’s mighty car on the
11528,SECTION CVII.,"right, he enveloped Rāvana with the dust raised by the wheels. Thereat"
11529,SECTION CVII.,"the Ten-necked one, enraged, with his eyes coppery and dilated (in"

11531,SECTION CVII.,"at the smiting, Rāma, with his ire aroused, but summoning up patience,"
11532,SECTION CVII.,took up in the encounter the bow of Indra endowed with exceeding
11533,SECTION CVII.,vehemence; as well as highly impetuous shafts having the resplendance of
11534,SECTION CVII.,the solar rays. And then there began a furious encounter between those
11535,SECTION CVII.,(two) eager for slaying each other; confronting each other like unto
11536,SECTION CVII.,"flaming lions. And then desirous of destruction of Rāvana,—celestials"
11537,SECTION CVII.,"with Gandharvas, and Siddhas and supersaints assembled to go to behold"
11538,SECTION CVII.,the encounter taking place between the two cars. And for the destruction
11539,SECTION CVII.,"of Rāvana and the success of Rāghava, there occurred round about the"
11540,SECTION CVII.,cars terrible bodements capable of making people’s down stand on end.
11541,SECTION CVII.,The god poured down showers of blood on the car of Rāvana; and a violent
11542,SECTION CVII.,"tornado eddied on his right. And a mighty swarm of vultures, wheeling in"
11543,SECTION CVII.,"the heavens, pursued the car wherever it moved. And Lankā was enveloped"
11544,SECTION CVII.,with evening resembling the red _javā_ flowers and even in day appeared
11545,SECTION CVII.,ablaze. Lightnings and firebrands accompanied by a terrible sound began
11546,SECTION CVII.,to fall down on all sides. And beholding these omens inauspicious unto
11547,SECTION CVII.,Rāvana all the Rākshasas were greatly sorry. And wherever Rāvana moved
11548,SECTION CVII.,the earth shook and the hands of all the Rākshasas fighting were as if
11549,SECTION CVII.,"paralysed. The copper coloured, the yellow, the red, and the white rays"
11550,SECTION CVII.,of the sun falling before Rāvana appeared like melted metals of a
11551,SECTION CVII.,"mountain. And the jackals followed by vultures, vomitting forth fire and"
11552,SECTION CVII.,"casting their looks at him, began to emit inauspicious cries. And in"
11553,SECTION CVII.,that battle-field the unfavourable wind began to blow raising dust and
11554,SECTION CVII.,obstructing the vision of the king of Rākshasas. On the Rākshasa host on
11555,SECTION CVII.,all sides dreadful lightnings were showered without the sound of the
11556,SECTION CVII.,clouds. All the quarters were enshrouded with darkness and the welkin
11557,SECTION CVII.,became invisible being covered with darkness. And setting up a dreadful
11558,SECTION CVII.,quarrel hundreds of terrible _Sharikas_⁴⁵⁹ began to fall down on his
11559,SECTION CVII.,chariot. The horses emitted forth sparks of fire from their hips and
11560,SECTION CVII.,tears from their eyes. These and various other dreadful omens arose
11561,SECTION CVII.,there announcing the destruction of Rāvana. And there appeared on all
11562,SECTION CVII.,sides many an auspicious and good sign intimating the approach of Rāma’s
11563,SECTION CVII.,victory. And beholding all those auspicious marks announcing Rāma’s
11564,SECTION CVII.,"success, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and considered Rāvana as slain."
11565,SECTION CVII.,"Thereupon beholding all those auspicious signs, Rāghava, well qualified"

11582,SECTION CVIII.,"of Rākshasas and the mighty host of the monkeys, although they had"
11583,SECTION CVIII.,"weapons in their hands, became stupified (for the time being). And"
11584,SECTION CVIII.,"beholding them (Rāma and Rāvana) fight, all the Rākshasas and monkeys,"
11585,SECTION CVIII.,"having their minds agitated, were greatly surprised. With various"
11586,SECTION CVIII.,"weapons and hands uplifted for fight, they, greatly wondered, stood"
11587,SECTION CVIII.,there beholding them and did not address themselves to fight with each
11588,SECTION CVIII.,"other. The Rākshasas beholding Rāvana, and the monkeys beholding Rāma"
11589,SECTION CVIII.,"with wonder-stricken eyes, the whole army appeared like a picture. And"
11590,SECTION CVIII.,"espieing all omens Rāghava and Rāvana began to fight, undaunted, firm,"
11591,SECTION CVIII.,resolute and unagitated by anger. And determining that Kākutstha would
11592,SECTION CVIII.,"win victory and Rāvana would die, they began to display their own"
11593,SECTION CVIII.,"prowess. Thereupon the highly powerful Rāvana, setting his arrows in"
11594,SECTION CVIII.,"anger, discharged them at the pennon stationed on Rāghava’s car. Those"
11595,SECTION CVIII.,arrows reaching the flag staff of the Purandara chariot and perceiving
11596,SECTION CVIII.,"its might fell down on the earth. Thereupon the highly powerful Rāma,"
11597,SECTION CVIII.,"wroth, stretching his bow, made up his mind to return the blow. And"
11598,SECTION CVIII.,aiming at Rāvana’s flag staff he discharged a sharpened shaft flaming
11599,SECTION CVIII.,unbearably by its own lustre like a huge serpent. And the effulgent Rāma
11600,SECTION CVIII.,"discharged a shaft aiming at (Rāvana’s) banner which, piercing the"
11601,SECTION CVIII.,"Ten-necked demon’s flag fell, down on the earth. And beholding his flag"
11602,SECTION CVIII.,staff thus broken down the highly powerful Rāvana became ablaze as if
11603,SECTION CVIII.,burning down every tiling with his unbearable ire And being possessed by
11604,SECTION CVIII.,"wrath he began to make a downpour of shafts. Rāvana then, with flaming"
11605,SECTION CVIII.,"arrows, pierced Rāma’s steeds. The celestial horses were not bewildered"
11606,SECTION CVIII.,thereby nor their course was slackened. And they remained thoroughly
11607,SECTION CVIII.,unagitated as if they were stricken with lotus stalks. Beholding the
11608,SECTION CVIII.,steeds thus unmoved Rāvana was again exercised with wrath and began to
11609,SECTION CVIII.,"discharge afresh his various weapons—_gadās_, _parighas_, _chakras_ and"
11610,SECTION CVIII.,"_musalas_, mountain tops, trees, darts and _parashus_ and thousands of"
11611,SECTION CVIII.,other shafts by virtue of his illusive powers. And unmoved was his
11612,SECTION CVIII.,energy. And that downpour of various weapons became huge and terrible in
11613,SECTION CVIII.,the conflict creating terror and making a dreadful noise. Thereupon
11614,SECTION CVIII.,leaving aside Rāghava’s car he began to assail the monkey-host and
11615,SECTION CVIII.,enveloped the sky with a continual discharge of arrows. The Ten-necked
11616,SECTION CVIII.,demon let loose many a weapon even at the risk of his own life. And
11617,SECTION CVIII.,beholding Rāvana in the encounter thus actively engaged in the discharge
11618,SECTION CVIII.,"of arrows, Kākuthstha, smiling, set up pointed shafts, and discharged"
11619,SECTION CVIII.,them by hundreds and thousands. Beholding them Rāvana again filled the
11620,SECTION CVIII.,welkin with arrows—and thus with shafts discharged by them both another
11621,SECTION CVIII.,"flaming sky was created. None (of the arrows) missed the aim, none of"
11622,SECTION CVIII.,them failed to pierce another and none of them was fruitless. And the
11623,SECTION CVIII.,arrows discharged by Rāma and Rāvana stricking each other fell down on
11624,SECTION CVIII.,the earth. And they standing on their right and left began to make a
11625,SECTION CVIII.,continued downpour of arrows and enveloped the sky entirely. And they
11626,SECTION CVIII.,"opposing each other, Rāvana slew Rāma’s steeds and Rāma in his turn slew"
11627,SECTION CVIII.,"Rāvanan’s. They, thus enraged fought with each other and for sometime"
11628,SECTION CVIII.,there ensued a terrible encounter capable of making ones down stand on
11629,SECTION CVIII.,end. And the highly powerful Rāvana and Rāma⁴⁶⁰ righting with each other
11630,SECTION CVIII.,"in the conflict by means of sharpened arrows, the lord of Rākshasas"
11631,SECTION CVIII.,beholding his flag staff broken down became enraged with the foremost of

11645,SECTION CIX.,"charioteers drove the cars on, displaying their skill by moving in"

11652,SECTION CIX.,touching that of the other and the heads of the steeds touching each
11653,SECTION CIX.,"other; and the pennons, stationed on one touched those of the other."
11654,SECTION CIX.,"Rāma, with four sharpened arrows, shot off his bow, removed the flaming"
11655,SECTION CIX.,horses of Rāvana to some distance. And finding his steeds thus removed
11656,SECTION CIX.,he was exercised with wrath. And the Ten-necked one discharged sharpened
11657,SECTION CIX.,arrows at Rāghava. And he was pierced by those arrows coming from the
11658,SECTION CIX.,powerful Ten-necked demon. He was neither overwhelmed nor pained
11659,SECTION CIX.,therewith and he again discharged arrows resembling the thunder-bolts.
11660,SECTION CIX.,"And the Ten-necked demon again discharged arrows at the charioteer,"
11661,SECTION CIX.,which fell with great vehemence on the person of Mātali. Mātali was not

11663,SECTION CIX.,charioteer thus assailed Rāma was excited with wrath and overwhelmed his
11664,SECTION CIX.,foe with a net of arrows. And the heroic Rāghava showered on his enemy’s
11665,SECTION CIX.,"chariot shafts by twentys, thirtys, sixtys, hundreds and thousands. And"
11666,SECTION CIX.,"the lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, who was stationed on the car, wroth,"
11667,SECTION CIX.,attacked Rāma in the conflict with maces and _Musalas_. And there again
11668,SECTION CIX.,ensued a terrible conflict capable of making one’s down stand on end.
11669,SECTION CIX.,"And the seven oceans were overwhelmed with the sound of maces,"
11670,SECTION CIX.,"_musalas_, _Parighas_ and gold feathered arrows. And those inhabiting"
11671,SECTION CIX.,"the regions under the agitated oceans, all the Dānavas and thousands of"
11672,SECTION CIX.,_Pannagas_ were greatly pained. And greatly shook the earth with her
11673,SECTION CIX.,"mountains, forests and gardens. The Sun was shorn of its resplendance"
11674,SECTION CIX.,"and the wind blew very rough. Thereupon the celestials, with"
11675,SECTION CIX.,"_Gandharbas_, _Siddhas_, great saints, _Kinnaras_ and serpents were all"
11676,SECTION CIX.,worked up with anxiety. And beholding the dreadful encounter between
11677,SECTION CIX.,"Rāma and Rāvana capable of making people’s down stand on end, the"
11678,SECTION CIX.,"celestials with ascetics began to pray,—""May good betide the Brahmins"
11679,SECTION CIX.,"and cows, may people live in peace and may Rāghava defeat Rāvana, the"
11680,SECTION CIX.,"lord of Rākshasas, in the conflict"". And the crowd of _Gandharbas_ and"
11681,SECTION CIX.,"_Apsaras_ beholding that wonderful battle between Rāma and Rāvana,"
11682,SECTION CIX.,"said,—""The ocean resembleth the sky and the sky resembleth the"
11683,SECTION CIX.,"ocean—forsooth this encounter between Rāma and Rāvana befits them only""."
11684,SECTION CIX.,"Thereupon Rāma of long-arms, the enhancer of the glory of Raghu’s race,"
11685,SECTION CIX.,"enraged, set his arrow, resembling a serpent, on his bow, and cut"
11686,SECTION CIX.,assunder Rāvana’s head wearing shinning _Kundalas_. And that head in the
11687,SECTION CIX.,presence of the inhabitants of the three regions fell down on the earth.
11688,SECTION CIX.,Instantly there arose another head resembling the former; and it was
11689,SECTION CIX.,speedily cut off by the light-handed Rāma. As soon as the second head
11690,SECTION CIX.,was chopped off in the encounter by means of shafts another appeared
11691,SECTION CIX.,again. And that was again severed by Rāma’s shafts resembling
11692,SECTION CIX.,thunder-bolts. And thus were severed hundred heads all equal in
11693,SECTION CIX.,brilliance. But the end of Rāvana’s life was not seen by him. Thereupon
11694,SECTION CIX.,"the heroic Rāghava, conversant with the use of all weapons, the enhancer"
11695,SECTION CIX.,"of Kauçalyi’s joy, began to reason within himself in various"
11696,SECTION CIX.,"Ways,—""Verily these are the arrows by which Māricha was killed, and"
11697,SECTION CIX.,Khara with Dushana was slain—Viradha was destroyed in the forest of
11698,SECTION CIX.,Krauncha—the headless demon in the forest of Dandaka—Salas and mountains

11700,SECTION CIX.,"perceive the reason, why they are becoming fruitless when discharged at"
11701,SECTION CIX.,"Rāvana"". Thinking thus Rāghava made himself ready In the conflict and"
11702,SECTION CIX.,"began to shower arrows on Rāvana’s breast. Thereupon Rāvana too, the"
11703,SECTION CIX.,"lord of Rākshasas, seated in a car and highly enraged, assailed Rāma in"
11704,SECTION CIX.,the conflict with a downpour of maces and _Musalas_. That dreadful and
11705,SECTION CIX.,"huge conflict, capable of making hairs stand on end, continued for seven"
11706,SECTION CIX.,"nights before the eyes of the celestials, Dānavas, Yakshas, Pisāchas,"

11708,SECTION CIX.,"mountain-tops. Neither for the night nor for the day, nor for a moment"

11711,SECTION CIX.,"victory, the high-souled charioteer of the lord of the celestials spake"

11721,SECTION CX.,weapon obtained from the great Patriarch. The time for (his)
11722,SECTION CX.,"destruction, as described by the celestials, hath arrived"". Being"
11723,SECTION CX.,"reminded by those words of Mātali, Rāma took up the flaming shaft,"
11724,SECTION CX.,breathing as if like a serpent. The great Rishi Agastya first conferred
11725,SECTION CX.,"this upon him. This is a huge and dreadful shaft given by Brahmā, and"
11726,SECTION CX.,highly useful in battle. It was made by Brahmā of undecaying prowess for
11727,SECTION CX.,Indra and conferred by him upon the Lord of celestials desirous of
11728,SECTION CX.,"acquiring victory. In its wings there is wind, in its head there is fire"
11729,SECTION CX.,"and the Sun, in its body there is the sky and in its weight there are"
11730,SECTION CX.,"the (hill) Meru and Mandara. It is resplendent by its own lustre, well"
11731,SECTION CX.,feathered and adorned with gold—made of the essence of all objects and
11732,SECTION CX.,bright as the rays of the Sun. It is like the fire of dissolution
11733,SECTION CX.,"enveloped in smoke—like the flaming serpent, capable of piercing men,"
11734,SECTION CX.,"serpents and horses and was swift-coursing. (It can) rend the gateways,"
11735,SECTION CX.,"_Parighas_ and hills—is soaked in blood, dipped in marrow, and extremely"
11736,SECTION CX.,"dreadful. It is hard as the lightning—producing a dreadful sound,"
11737,SECTION CX.,"assailing various (divisions of the) army, creating terror unto all,"
11738,SECTION CX.,dreadful and (as if) breathing like a serpent. It is terrible as the
11739,SECTION CX.,"Death in the conflict and provides food always for the herons, vultures,"
11740,SECTION CX.,"cranes, jackals and the Rākshasas. It is the enhancer of the"
11741,SECTION CX.,monkey-leaders’ joy and the repressor of the Rākshasas and is feathered
11742,SECTION CX.,like unto a bird with many a picturesque wing. And the highly powerful
11743,SECTION CX.,"Rāma, consecrating in accordance with the _mantras_ laid down in the"
11744,SECTION CX.,"Vedas, that huge shaft—the foremost of all in the world, removing the"
11745,SECTION CX.,"fear of the Ikshwāku race, destroying the fame of the enemies and"
11746,SECTION CX.,"conducing to the joy of its own party, set it on his bow. And that"
11747,SECTION CX.,excellent arrow being mounted on his bow by Rāghava all the animals were
11748,SECTION CX.,"stricken with fear and the earth shook. And (Rāma) highly enraged, and"
11749,SECTION CX.,"greatly wary, suppressing (his breath) discharged that shaft at"
11750,SECTION CX.,Rāvana—piercing to the vitals. (That Brahmā weapon) irrepressible as the
11751,SECTION CX.,"thunder, dreadful as the Death and discharged by Rāma, fell down on"
11752,SECTION CX.,"Rāvana’s breast. And that shaft, capable of bringing about death and"
11753,SECTION CX.,"gifted with velocity, when discharged, cleft the breast of the"
11754,SECTION CX.,"vicious-souled Rāvana. And that body-ending arrow, bathed in blood,"
11755,SECTION CX.,"stealing away the life of Rāvana, entered the earth. That shaft, slaying"
11756,SECTION CX.,"Rāvana, soaked in blood and successful, again entered the quiver⁴⁶¹"
11757,SECTION CX.,"humbly. And from his hand, who was deprived of his life, fell down"
11758,SECTION CX.,instantly on earth his shafts and bow. And fell down on the earth from
11759,SECTION CX.,"the chariot, the highly effulgent Rāvana, gifted with dreadful velocity"
11760,SECTION CX.,"and shorn of his life. And beholding him thus fallen down, the remaining"
11761,SECTION CX.,"night-rangers, deprived of their lord and stricken with terror fled away"
11762,SECTION CX.,to various quarters. And beholding the destruction of the Ten-necked
11763,SECTION CX.,"(demon) and the victory of Rāghava, the monkeys, fighting with trees,"
11764,SECTION CX.,pursued them on all sides. And being assailed by the monkeys and having
11765,SECTION CX.,their countenances full of tears in consequence of their lord being
11766,SECTION CX.,slain they fled away to Lankā in fear. Thereupon the monkeys being
11767,SECTION CX.,greatly delighted roared out the victory of Rāma. The celestial bugle
11768,SECTION CX.,was sounded in the sky and there blew the excellent air carrying the

11773,SECTION CX.,"slaying that foremost of the Rākshasas, Rāma satisfied the desire of"

11799,SECTION CXI.,"delusions. Prahasta, Indrajit, Kumbhakarna, Atikāya, Atiratha,"

11809,SECTION CXI.,"like one asleep, whom else have these remaining (Rākshasas) deprived of"

11823,SECTION CXI.,"said,—""(This lord of Rākshasas) of dreadful prowess hath not been slain"
11824,SECTION CXI.,in battle disabled. He is gifted with great prowess and energy and

11826,SECTION CXI.,"Kshatriyas, who fall at the battle field for enhancing their glory, when"

11828,SECTION CXI.,"although possessed by death, by whom gifted with intellect, Indra with"
11829,SECTION CXI.,the three worlds was terrified in conflict. Besides success in battle is
11830,SECTION CXI.,not perpetual; either one slays his enemy or meets with his destruction
11831,SECTION CXI.,at his hands in the conflict This procedure of the Kshatryas was laid
11832,SECTION CXI.,"down by the ancient preceptors that a Kshatrya, when slain in battle"
11833,SECTION CXI.,should not be mourned for. Beholding this to be certain and attaining
11834,SECTION CXI.,"calmness, do thou be freed from thy sorrow and think what should be done"
11835,SECTION CXI.,now. Thereupon Bibhishana stricken with grief addressed the powerful son
11836,SECTION CXI.,of the king speaking thus with words tending to his brother’s
11837,SECTION CXI.,"well-being. ""Thou hast, like the ocean breaking down its banks, broken"
11838,SECTION CXI.,"him down, who had not been ere this even defeated by Bāsava and the"

11845,SECTION CXI.,"accents, the high-souled son of the lord of men, gifted with great"
11846,SECTION CXI.,"energy, ordered him to perform his obsequies and said. ""With death our"

11859,SECTION CXII.,with dishevelled hairs they rolled in the dust albeit prevented again
11860,SECTION CXII.,and again like unto cows separated from their calves. And coming out by
11861,SECTION CXII.,"the northern gate along with the Rākshasas, entering the dreadful arena"
11862,SECTION CXII.,of battle and searching their slain lord the she-demons cried
11863,SECTION CXII.,"piteously—""O lord, O husband, O our all"" and moved along the battle"

11865,SECTION CXII.,of tears and overwhelmed with the grief of their husband they began to
11866,SECTION CXII.,move about like she-elephants without the lord of their herd. Thereupon
11867,SECTION CXII.,they beheld there on the earth the huge-bodied and the highly powerful
11868,SECTION CXII.,and effulgent Rāvana slain like red collyrium. And beholding their lord
11869,SECTION CXII.,lying down on the battle-field they all fell on his body like creepers
11870,SECTION CXII.,torn assunder. Some wept embracing him respectfully—some holding his
11871,SECTION CXII.,feet and some placing themselves around his neck. And some taking up his
11872,SECTION CXII.,hand rolled on the ground and some were beside themselves (with grief)
11873,SECTION CXII.,beholding the slain (Rāvana’s) countenance. And some placing her head on
11874,SECTION CXII.,"his lap, and beholding his face, wept, bathing it with tears like a"
11875,SECTION CXII.,lotus enveloped with snow. Seeing their husband Rāvana thus slain on the
11876,SECTION CXII.,"earth, they stricken with grief, bewailing again and again in sorrow,"
11877,SECTION CXII.,wept profusely. He by whom the king Vaisrabana was deprived of his
11878,SECTION CXII.,"flower car, who terrified the high-souled Gandharbas, ascetics and the"
11879,SECTION CXII.,"celestials in battle field, who did not know of any fear from the"

11881,SECTION CXII.,"He, whom the celestials, the Dānavas and the Rakshas could not slay,"
11882,SECTION CXII.,"hath been slain in conflict by a man walking on foot. He, who was"
11883,SECTION CXII.,"incapable of being killed by the celestials, Yakshas and Asuras, hath"
11884,SECTION CXII.,"met with death like one devoid of prowess at the hands of a mortal""."
11885,SECTION CXII.,"Speaking in this wise, the she-demons, over-powered with sorrow, wept"

11888,SECTION CXII.,thy destruction as well as that of the Rākshasas. Although thy brother
11889,SECTION CXII.,"Bibhishana addressed thee with words pregnant with thy welfare—thou, for"
11890,SECTION CXII.,"thy own destruction, out of thy misgivings, didst excite his anger and"
11891,SECTION CXII.,hast (now) seen (the result thereof). Hadst thou returned Sitā the
11892,SECTION CXII.,"daughter of the king of Mithilā to Rāma, this mighty and dreadful"
11893,SECTION CXII.,"disaster, destroying the very root, would not have befallen us. Rāma’s"
11894,SECTION CXII.,desire would have been encompassed—his friends would have been
11895,SECTION CXII.,successful (through Bibhishana)—we would not been widowed and our
11896,SECTION CXII.,"enemies would not have got their desires fulfilled. By thee, Sitā was"
11897,SECTION CXII.,"kept by force in captivity in a ruthless manner, and the Rākshasas,"
11898,SECTION CXII.,ourselves and thyself—all three equally have been slain. O foremost of
11899,SECTION CXII.,"the Rākshasas, forsooth this is not thy own folly—it is Accident that"
11900,SECTION CXII.,uniteth all things and it is Accident again that bringeth about
11901,SECTION CXII.,destruction. O thou of huge arms—the destruction of the monkeys and the
11902,SECTION CXII.,Rākshasas as well as that of thyself hath been brought about by

11919,SECTION CXIII.,"far-famed Gandharbas and the _Chāranas_, fled away to different quarters"

11921,SECTION CXIII.,"who is a mere man? Why is it that thou art not ashamed of it, O king, O"
11922,SECTION CXIII.,lord of the Rākshasas? Conquering the three worlds with thy prowess thou
11923,SECTION CXIII.,"didst attain thy glory; and it is unbearable, that a man, ranging in the"
11924,SECTION CXIII.,"forest, hath slain thee. Thou, who art capable of assuming shapes at"
11925,SECTION CXIII.,"will, hast been slain in conflict by Rāma, in the city of Lankā"
11926,SECTION CXIII.,"unapproachable by men. I do not believe that thy destruction,—who hadst"

11929,SECTION CXIII.,"illusions unconsciously for thy destruction, O thou of great strength."
11930,SECTION CXIII.,Or thou hast been slain by Vāsava—(no) what power has he got to face
11931,SECTION CXIII.,"thee in the conflict gifted with great strength, prowess and energy and"
11932,SECTION CXIII.,an enemy of the celestials as thou art? It is evident that the great
11933,SECTION CXIII.,"ascetic Vishnu, having truth for his prowess—the soul of all beings,"
11934,SECTION CXIII.,"ever existing, without beginning, middle or end, greater than the great,"
11935,SECTION CXIII.,"the Preserver of the Nature, holding conch, discus and club, having"
11936,SECTION CXIII.,"_Sribatsa_⁴⁶³ on his breast, always beautiful, incapable of being"
11937,SECTION CXIII.,"conquered, without destruction, devoid of end, and the lord of all men,"
11938,SECTION CXIII.,"assuming this shape of a man and encircled by the celestials, assuming"
11939,SECTION CXIII.,"monkey shapes, hath for the behoof of mankind, slain (thee) the dreadful"
11940,SECTION CXIII.,enemy of the gods with all (thy) family and Rākshasas. Subduing all thy
11941,SECTION CXIII.,"passions, thou didst conquer the three worlds—remembering their grudge"
11942,SECTION CXIII.,they have now over-powered thee. Rāma is not a man since he slew at
11943,SECTION CXIII.,Janasthāna thy brother Khara encircled by many a Rākshasa. We were
11944,SECTION CXIII.,"sore-distressed when Hanumān, by his own prowess, entered the city of"
11945,SECTION CXIII.,"Lankā, incapable of being approached even by the celestials. And I"
11946,SECTION CXIII.,"prevented thee from creating enmity with Rāghava, but thou didst not pay"
11947,SECTION CXIII.,heed to my words and this is the result (thereof). O foremost of
11948,SECTION CXIII.,"Rākshasas—thou of a vicious understanding, for the destruction of thy"
11949,SECTION CXIII.,"wealth, thyself and thy relatives, thou didst suddenly cherish amour for"
11950,SECTION CXIII.,"Sitā, greater than (even) Arundhuti and Rohini. Forsooth thou didst"
11951,SECTION CXIII.,perpetrate an unbecoming deed by distressing the adorable Sitā ever
11952,SECTION CXIII.,"devoted unto her lord, an earth⁴⁶⁴ even unto Earth herself and a Sree⁴⁶⁵"
11953,SECTION CXIII.,even unto Sree herself. And having brought in a false guise from the
11954,SECTION CXIII.,"solitary forest the sorrowful and chaste Sitā, having a blameless"
11955,SECTION CXIII.,"person, thou didst bring on the destruction of thy family. Thou didst"
11956,SECTION CXIII.,"fail to encompass thy desire for the company of Sitā. But now, forsooth,"
11957,SECTION CXIII.,"O my lord, thou hast been burnt down by her devotion who is devoted unto"
11958,SECTION CXIII.,her husband.⁴⁶⁶ Thou wert not burnt down when thou didst captivate that
11959,SECTION CXIII.,middle-statured (damsel) whom fear all the celestials headed by Indra
11960,SECTION CXIII.,"and _Agni_.⁴⁶⁷ O husband, (proper) time appearing the perpetrator gets"
11961,SECTION CXIII.,the result of his vicious deeds: there is not the least doubt in this.
11962,SECTION CXIII.,The performer of the good receives good (result)—the perpetrator of the
11963,SECTION CXIII.,vicious (deeds) meets with bad (result). Bibhishana hath attained to
11964,SECTION CXIII.,happiness and thou hast met with this thy end. There are damsels in your
11965,SECTION CXIII.,seraglio far more beautiful than she but thou possessed by cupid couldst
11966,SECTION CXIII.,not perceive this. Maithilee is not my equal nor superior either in
11967,SECTION CXIII.,"birth, beauty or accomplishments, but thou didst not perceive this by"
11968,SECTION CXIII.,thy misgivings. Death doth not always visit all men without any
11969,SECTION CXIII.,"cause—and Maithilee is the cause of thy death. And death, in consequence"
11970,SECTION CXIII.,"of Maithilee, hath taken thee far away. And she, shorn of all sorrow,"
11971,SECTION CXIII.,"shall enjoy in the company of Rāma, and I, of limited piety, am now sunk"
11972,SECTION CXIII.,in the the ocean of grief. Roaming at large with thee in a car
11973,SECTION CXIII.,"unequalled in beauty on the hill Kailāça, Mandara, Maru, in the garden"
11974,SECTION CXIII.,"of Chaitraratha and ail other celestial gardens, beholding many a"
11975,SECTION CXIII.,"country, wearing variegated clothes and garlands, I have been deprived"
11976,SECTION CXIII.,"of all pleasures and enjoyments, O hero, by thy death. And I am a widow"
11977,SECTION CXIII.,"now. O fie on fickle fortune! O king, in lustre of countenance thou art"
11978,SECTION CXIII.,"like the Sun, in grace like the Moon, in beauty like the lotus; thou art"
11979,SECTION CXIII.,"graceful, O thou having excellent brows; thou hast got excellent skin,"
11980,SECTION CXIII.,high nose and thy countenance is graced with a brilliant crown and
11981,SECTION CXIII.,"_Kundalas_. Oh how beautiful, thou didst look with various garlands when"
11982,SECTION CXIII.,thy eye whirled with intoxication on the drinking ground and how
11983,SECTION CXIII.,"beautiful were thy smiles, O lord. Thy countenance doth not shine"
11984,SECTION CXIII.,"now—being severed with Rāma’s shafts, bathed in a pool of blood, having"
11985,SECTION CXIII.,thy back-bone and brain deranged and covered with the dust raised by the
11986,SECTION CXIII.,wheels of the chariots. Alas! by my ill-luck I have attained to that
11987,SECTION CXIII.,after state making me a widow which I did never think of. My father is
11988,SECTION CXIII.,"the king of Dānavas, my husband the lord of Rākshasas, and my son the"
11989,SECTION CXIII.,subduer of Sakra. I was greatly proud of this and always confident that
11990,SECTION CXIII.,"my protectors were undaunted, dreadful, repressors of the enemies and"
11991,SECTION CXIII.,"famous for their strength and manliness. O ye foremost of the Rākshasas,"
11992,SECTION CXIII.,how could this fear from man overwhelm you all who were so powerful?
11993,SECTION CXIII.,"(This thy body) is cool, green like _Indraneela_, high like a huge"
11994,SECTION CXIII.,"mountain, and adorned with _Keyura_, _Angada_, jewels and garlands of"
11995,SECTION CXIII.,flowers. It was graceful in places of enjoyments and incapable of being
11996,SECTION CXIII.,"looked at in the field of battle. It was brilliant, being decked with"
11997,SECTION CXIII.,ornaments like unto clouds accompanied by lightnings. And this thy
11998,SECTION CXIII.,person hath been pierced with shafts to-day; (and knowing) that it is
11999,SECTION CXIII.,"not easy of attainment for me I am incapable of embracing (it), covered"
12000,SECTION CXIII.,with shafts piercing through the very vitals. O king (this thy body)
12001,SECTION CXIII.,green-hued (but now) blood-red is now lying on the ground like unto a
12002,SECTION CXIII.,mountain shattered with thunder-bolts. That thou wouldst be slain by
12003,SECTION CXIII.,"Rāma was like a dream, but it hath proved true! Thou wert like death"
12004,SECTION CXIII.,"unto Death himself, why hast thou been possessed by him then? Thou wert"
12005,SECTION CXIII.,the enjoyer of the three worlds’ wealth and dread unto them; thou wert
12006,SECTION CXIII.,the conqueror of the deities presiding over various quarters; thou didst
12007,SECTION CXIII.,shake Sankara (himself)—thou wert the subduer of the proud and thy
12008,SECTION CXIII.,prowess was well-known; thou didst repress the people and slay many a
12009,SECTION CXIII.,"pious man—thou didst, by thy prowess, use to give vent to haughty words"
12010,SECTION CXIII.,before the enemies; thou wert the maintainer of thy kinsmen and servants
12011,SECTION CXIII.,and the slayer of many perpetrating dreadful deeds; thou wert the
12012,SECTION CXIII.,"destroyer of thousands of celestials, Dānavas and Yakshas; thou wert the"
12013,SECTION CXIII.,subduer of _Nivata Kavachas_ in the encounter; thou didst hinder the
12014,SECTION CXIII.,performance of many sacrifices and wert the protector of thy relatives;
12015,SECTION CXIII.,"thou wert the obstructer of pious observances, creator of illusions in"
12016,SECTION CXIII.,conflict and thou didst bring away from hither and thither the daughters
12017,SECTION CXIII.,"of the celestials, demons and men; thou didst aggrieve the wives of thy"
12018,SECTION CXIII.,"enemies; thou wert the leader of thy own men, the protector of the"
12019,SECTION CXIII.,island of Lankā and the performer of many a dreadful deed; thou didst
12020,SECTION CXIII.,confer upon us the enjoyment of many a pleasure—and wert the foremost of
12021,SECTION CXIII.,"car-warriors. Beholding such a husband slain by Rāma, I am, deprived of"
12022,SECTION CXIII.,"my dear lord, still maintaining my being; (forsooth) my heart is very"
12023,SECTION CXIII.,"hard. O lord of Rākshasas, used ere to many a valuable bed, why art thou"
12024,SECTION CXIII.,sleeping on earth covered with dust? When my son Indrajit was slain by
12025,SECTION CXIII.,Lakshmana in conflict I was greatly pained—but to-day I am slain.
12026,SECTION CXIII.,"Deprived of my friends and relatives, separated from thee O my lord,"
12027,SECTION CXIII.,deprived from the enjoyment of many pleasures I shall lament for thee
12028,SECTION CXIII.,"perpetually. Thou hast, O king, reached the way, long and hard to be"
12029,SECTION CXIII.,"treaded—do thou take me, who am stricken with grief and who shall not be"
12030,SECTION CXIII.,able to live without thee. Why dost thou wish to go leaving me behind
12031,SECTION CXIII.,"who have been rendered poorly? Why dost thou not welcome me, unfortunate"
12032,SECTION CXIII.,"and poor, who am bewailing? Why art thou not angry, lord, beholding me,"
12033,SECTION CXIII.,"having put off my veil, walk out on foot by the city-gate? O beloved of"
12034,SECTION CXIII.,"thy wives, do thou behold thy wives—who have thrown off their veils. Why"
12035,SECTION CXIII.,art thou not angry seeing them all come out (of the city)? I was thy
12036,SECTION CXIII.,"companion in sports, my lord; I long for having thee; why art thou not"
12037,SECTION CXIII.,"consoling and welcoming me? O king, being imprecated by those damsels,"
12038,SECTION CXIII.,"not one, devoted to their husbands, pious and ever engaged in attending"
12039,SECTION CXIII.,"upon their superiors, who had been widowed by thee, thou hast been"
12040,SECTION CXIII.,"overpowered by thy enemy. The carte, proceeding from them who had been"
12041,SECTION CXIII.,"ill-treated by thee, hath borne fruit. O king, the saying, that the"
12042,SECTION CXIII.,"tears of chaste damsels do not uselessly fall on the ground, hath been"
12043,SECTION CXIII.,"verified (here) forsooth. O king, conquering the worlds with thy"
12044,SECTION CXIII.,"prowess, how couldst thou, always honored by the king, cherish the vile"
12045,SECTION CXIII.,desire of stealing away women? Taking away Rāma and Lakshmana from the
12046,SECTION CXIII.,"hermitage by an illusionary deer, thou didst steal away Rāma’s spouse. I"
12047,SECTION CXIII.,"remember to have never heard thee lament in battle. Forsooth, it is our"
12048,SECTION CXIII.,misfortune and the sign of impending death (that thou didst do this)
12049,SECTION CXIII.,"conversant as thou art with the past, present and future. Beholding the"
12050,SECTION CXIII.,"daughter of the king of Mithilā brought (in the city of Lankā) what, thy"
12051,SECTION CXIII.,"younger brother Bibhishana, thinking and sighing, said, hath now proved"
12052,SECTION CXIII.,"true, O thou of long-arms. This destruction of the leading Rākshasas"
12053,SECTION CXIII.,hath proceeded from the disaster arising from thy anger and lust. For
12054,SECTION CXIII.,thy (vicious) deeds all our good fortune is lost—(and from them) hath
12055,SECTION CXIII.,proceeded the great disaster exterminating the race. And by thee all the
12056,SECTION CXIII.,"Rākshasa families have been deprived of their lords. Thou, well-known"
12057,SECTION CXIII.,"for thy strength and manliness, art not worthy of being grieved by me."
12058,SECTION CXIII.,On account of my effeminate nature my understanding is possessed by
12059,SECTION CXIII.,sorrow. Carrying thy pious and iniquitous deeds thou hast attained to
12060,SECTION CXIII.,thy own state—I am only lamenting for me who have been sorry for thy
12061,SECTION CXIII.,"destruction. O Ten-necked one, thou didst not bear the words of thy"
12062,SECTION CXIII.,"friends and brothers, who spoke those well meaning words out of"
12063,SECTION CXIII.,"affection. Thou didst not obey the words uttered by Bibhisana, duly and"
12064,SECTION CXIII.,"mildly, pregnant with meaning and reasoning and tending to thy welfare."
12065,SECTION CXIII.,"Maddened with thy own prowess thou didst not hear the words of Māricha,"
12066,SECTION CXIII.,Kumbhakarna as well as those of my father—and this is the result
12067,SECTION CXIII.,"thereof. O thou resembling the red clouds, O thou wearing yellow cloth"
12068,SECTION CXIII.,"and excellent _Angada_, stretching thy person on the ground why art thou"
12069,SECTION CXIII.,"in the long run bathed in blood? Why dost thou not, like one asleep,"
12070,SECTION CXIII.,welcome me who am stricken with grief? I am the grand-daughter of the
12071,SECTION CXIII.,highly powerful Rākshasa Sumāli who never flies away from the field of
12072,SECTION CXIII.,battle: why dost thou not welcome me? Rise up! rise up! why dost thou
12073,SECTION CXIII.,lie down (on this occasion of) new discomfiture? To-day have the rays of
12074,SECTION CXIII.,"the Sun entered fearlessly the city of Lankā. The Parigha, by which,"
12075,SECTION CXIII.,"brilliant as the rays of the Sun, thou didst distress the enemies in"
12076,SECTION CXIII.,"conflict, which was always adored by thee like the thunder of the"
12077,SECTION CXIII.,"wielder of thunder-bolt, which slew many in battle, and which was"
12078,SECTION CXIII.,"adorned with golden nets, now lieth shattered into thousand pieces by"
12079,SECTION CXIII.,arrows. Why dost thou lie on the battle-field embracing her like your
12080,SECTION CXIII.,beloved spouse? Why dost thou not wish to welcome me like one not
12081,SECTION CXIII.,beloved unto thee? Oh fie on this heart of mine which is not sundered
12082,SECTION CXIII.,"into thousand (pieces) albeit distressed with the grief of thy death!"""
12083,SECTION CXIII.,"Bewailing thus, she, with profuse tears in her eyes, and with her heart"
12084,SECTION CXIII.,"overflowing with affection, became senseless. And being beside herself"
12085,SECTION CXIII.,"she flung herself on Rāvana’s breast, like unto the bright lightning"
12086,SECTION CXIII.,"appearing on red evening clouds. Thereupon the other wives, of Rāvana,"
12087,SECTION CXIII.,"greatly distressed and weeping, and raising her up who was greatly"
12088,SECTION CXIII.,"weeping, began to console her saying:—""Dost thou not know, O worshipful"
12089,SECTION CXIII.,"dame, that the life of beings is very uncertain, and with adverse"
12090,SECTION CXIII.,"circumstances even the royal fortune becometh fickle?"" Being thus"
12091,SECTION CXIII.,"accosted she again wept aloud, bathing with tears her breast and"
12092,SECTION CXIII.,"beautiful countenance. In the meantime Rāma said to Bibhisana,—""Do thou"
12093,SECTION CXIII.,"perform the funeral ceremonies of thy brother and console his wives""."
12094,SECTION CXIII.,Whereto the intelligent Bibhisana replied with the following
12095,SECTION CXIII.,"words—pointing out wealth and piety, and judging by his understanding"
12096,SECTION CXIII.,"what is proper. ""I do not think it proper to perform his cremation"
12097,SECTION CXIII.,"ceremony who had renounced all pious deeds, was wicked, cruel, liar and"
12098,SECTION CXIII.,who had ravished others’ wives. He is my enemy in the shape of a brother
12099,SECTION CXIII.,ever engaged in doing injury unto others—and Rāvana is not worthy of my
12100,SECTION CXIII.,adoration albeit he is adorable by virtue of his being my elder brother.
12101,SECTION CXIII.,"O Rāma, perhaps people of this earth will call me cruel but they will"
12102,SECTION CXIII.,again recognise my act as good when they will hear of his vicious
12103,SECTION CXIII.,"deeds"". Hearing those words, Rāma, the foremost of the pious and"
12104,SECTION CXIII.,"conversant with the skill of speech, greatly delighted, spoke unto"
12105,SECTION CXIII.,"Bibhishana (equally) skilled in speech,—""It behoveth me to encompass thy"
12106,SECTION CXIII.,welfare since by thy help I have gained the victory. O lord of
12107,SECTION CXIII.,"Rākshasas, forsooth, thou shouldst hear my well-meaning words. Although"
12108,SECTION CXIII.,"this night-ranger perpetrated many vicious and impious deeds, still he"
12109,SECTION CXIII.,"was ever powerful, heroic and strong in warfare. I have heard that this"
12110,SECTION CXIII.,"high-souled Rāvana, gifted with strength and a dread unto all people,"
12111,SECTION CXIII.,was not defeated (even) by the celestials headed by the performer of a
12112,SECTION CXIII.,hundred sacrifices. Enmity extendeth up to death—so it hath ended; there
12113,SECTION CXIII.,is no necessity (of carrying it on). Do thou (therefore) perform his
12114,SECTION CXIII.,cremation ceremony—he is unto thee as he is unto me. O thou of long-arms
12115,SECTION CXIII.,"it behoveth thee to perform, speedily with due rites and religious"
12116,SECTION CXIII.,"ceremonies, his funeral ceremony—thou shalt be the object of praise"
12117,SECTION CXIII.,"(unto people)"". Hearing the words of Rāghava, Bibhishana hastened on and"
12118,SECTION CXIII.,began to make arrangements for the cremation of his slain brother
12119,SECTION CXIII.,"Rāvana. And entering the city of Lankā, Bibhishana, the lord of"
12120,SECTION CXIII.,"Rākshasas, speedily got out Rāvana’s _Agnihotra_,⁴⁶⁸ carts, brass"
12121,SECTION CXIII.,"utensils, fire, (and brought) _Jajakas_,⁴⁶⁹ sandal-wood, other woods,"
12122,SECTION CXIII.,"essences, _Agura_, other fragrant substances, precious stones, pearls"
12123,SECTION CXIII.,and corals. Thereupon arriving immediately accompanied by Rākshasas and
12124,SECTION CXIII.,Malyavāna he engaged in the performance of cremation ceremony. Thereupon
12125,SECTION CXIII.,"the twice-born ones, with tears in their eyes, covered the Rākshasa-king"
12126,SECTION CXIII.,"Rāvana’s body, with a silken cloth and placed it on a golden celestial"
12127,SECTION CXIII.,litter. With the sound of various bugles they began to chaunt his
12128,SECTION CXIII.,praise. And taking up this litter adorned with various charming
12129,SECTION CXIII.,"paintings and flags and carrying fire woods, all the Rākshasas headed by"
12130,SECTION CXIII.,"Bibhishana proceeded towards the South.⁴⁷⁰ The Brahmins, versed in"
12131,SECTION CXIII.,"_Yayur Veda_ and with burning fire in their hands, proceeded and were"
12132,SECTION CXIII.,followed by the attendants. And the damsels of the seraglio followed
12133,SECTION CXIII.,speedily leaping (being ever unused to walking). And placing Rāvana on
12134,SECTION CXIII.,"the cremation ground, they, greatly stricken with grief, prepared the"
12135,SECTION CXIII.,"funeral pyre according to due rites with sandalwoods, _Padmakas_,⁴⁷¹"
12136,SECTION CXIII.,_Ushiras_⁴⁷² and sandal and spread an antelope-skin thereon. They (then)
12137,SECTION CXIII.,performed the excellent obsequies of the manes of the lord of Rākshasas.
12138,SECTION CXIII.,And raising an altar at the south-east corner they placed fire at the
12139,SECTION CXIII.,proper place. They then poured curd and clarified butter upon (Rāvana’s)
12140,SECTION CXIII.,"shoulders. And placing _Sakata_ on his legs, _Ulukhala_⁴⁷³ on his"
12141,SECTION CXIII.,"thighs, and the brass untensils, Arunis and Musals in their proper"
12142,SECTION CXIII.,"places, they celebrated (the obsequies of his manes). Thereupon slaying"
12143,SECTION CXIII.,beasts according to the rites laid down in _Sāstras_ and pointed out by
12144,SECTION CXIII.,"the great saints, the Rākshasas (made a coverlet dipped in their marrow"
12145,SECTION CXIII.,and clarified butter) and placed it on the face of the lord of
12146,SECTION CXIII.,Rākshasas. And decking Rāvana with fragrant garlands and various
12147,SECTION CXIII.,"clothes, the friends, of Bibhishana, with depressed heart and tears in"
12148,SECTION CXIII.,"their eyes, showered dried paddy (on his person). And Bibhishana"
12149,SECTION CXIII.,according to due rites put fire to his (funeral pyre). Bathing and with
12150,SECTION CXIII.,"wetted cloth, offering duly linseed and sacrificial grass mixed with"
12151,SECTION CXIII.,"water and consoling (Rāvana’s) wives again and again, he entreated them"
12152,SECTION CXIII.,to go back. They then entered the city. And those damsels having entered
12153,SECTION CXIII.,"the city, Bibhishana, the lord of Rākshasas, approaching Rāma, stood by"
12154,SECTION CXIII.,"his side gently. And Rāma too, along with his army, Sugriva and"
12155,SECTION CXIII.,"Lakshmana, was greatly delighted after slaying his enemy like unto the"
12156,SECTION CXIII.,wielder of thunder-bolt after slaying (the demon) Vitra. Thereupon
12157,SECTION CXIII.,"leaving aside his bow with arrows, and the huge armour conferred by"
12158,SECTION CXIII.,Mahendra and renouncing ire after the destruction of his enemy Rāma
12159,SECTION CXIII.,assumed gentle mein.

12200,SECTION CXIV.,the charioteer to take back the celestial car bright as the sky sent by
12201,SECTION CXIV.,"Indra, honoured him greatly. And being commanded by Rāghava Mātali, the"

12203,SECTION CXIV.,"that charioteer rising up into the celestial region, Rāghava, the"

12205,SECTION CXIV.,"embracing Sugriva, bowed unto by Lakshmana and worshipped by the monkey"

12208,SECTION CXIV.,"him—""O gentle one, take this Bibhishana to the city of Lankā ever"

12210,SECTION CXIV.,desire that I may behold Bibhishana the younger brother of Rāvana
12211,SECTION CXIV.,"installed on the throne of Lankā"". Being thus addressed by the"
12212,SECTION CXIV.,"high-souled Rāghava, the son of Sumitrā, saying—""So be it"" and greatly"
12213,SECTION CXIV.,"delighted, brought a golden jar. And placing that jar at the hands of"
12214,SECTION CXIV.,"the lord of monkeys, that one, gifted with great energy, ordered them to"
12215,SECTION CXIV.,bring water from the Ocean. And repairing speedily those excellent
12216,SECTION CXIV.,monkeys came back with water from the ocean. And taking that jar and
12217,SECTION CXIV.,placing him on an excellent seat Saumitri with that water sprinkled

12288,SECTION CXV.,"these words of thine, far greater than the wealth, jewels or even the"
12289,SECTION CXV.,sovereignty over the celestials. Forsooth I have gained the kingdom of
12290,SECTION CXV.,"the celestials and other things since I have beheld Rāma slay his enemy,"

12298,SECTION CXV.,"Thereupon not being elated the least, he again, humbly folding his hands"
12299,SECTION CXV.,"with delight and stationed before Sitā, said—""If dost thou permit me I"
12300,SECTION CXV.,"may slay all these she-demons who had tortured thee before, distressed"
12301,SECTION CXV.,"thee in the forest of Açoka, stricken with grief of thy lord, and who"
12302,SECTION CXV.,"are cruel, have grim eyes and who perpetrate always dreadful deeds. O"
12303,SECTION CXV.,"worshipful dame, I have heard that these grim-visaged she-demons"
12304,SECTION CXV.,distressed thee greatly with harsh words at the command of Rāvana. I
12305,SECTION CXV.,"desire to slay all these dreadful, crooked, ugly (she-demons) having"
12306,SECTION CXV.,"fearful eyes, meting out unto them various punishments. I wish to slay"
12307,SECTION CXV.,"all these she-demons, who had used harsh words and had always offended"

12309,SECTION CXV.,"teeth, chopping off their ears and noses, and pulling them by their"
12310,SECTION CXV.,"hairs: do thou confer upon me this permission. O far famed lady, I shall"
12311,SECTION CXV.,"slay them by these various means, by whom, dreadful as they are, thou"
12312,SECTION CXV.,"hadst been distressed before"". Being thus addressed by Hanumān, she,"
12313,SECTION CXV.,"ever kind unto the poor, thinking and meditating, said to him—""O"
12314,SECTION CXV.,"foremost of monkeys, why art thou angry with these she-slaves, who"
12315,SECTION CXV.,"subject as they are to the command of their lord, have done this in"
12316,SECTION CXV.,accordance with another’s order. For my adverse fortune and vicious
12317,SECTION CXV.,deeds perpetrated in another birth I have been subject to such a plight
12318,SECTION CXV.,"and been suffering the consequence thereof. Do thou not speak thus, O"
12319,SECTION CXV.,thou of huge arms. Such is the course of Fortune. Forsooth by my
12320,SECTION CXV.,"ill-luck I have met with (this misfortune). I forgive, out of pity, all"
12321,SECTION CXV.,these she-servants of Rāvana; they used to torture me at the command of
12322,SECTION CXV.,"that Rākshasa. And he being slain they shall not repress me any longer,"
12323,SECTION CXV.,"O son of the Wind-god. Do thou, O monkey, hear of a _Sloka_, related in"
12324,SECTION CXV.,"a _Purāna_ and pregnant with religious import, which was uttered by a"
12325,SECTION CXV.,boar to a tiger. ’No one taketh upon himself the iniquity of a
12326,SECTION CXV.,perpetrator of vicious deeds. So it behoveth the pious crowned with an
12327,SECTION CXV.,excellent character to observe the rules (of piety). So it is proper to
12328,SECTION CXV.,show compassion even upon those who perpetrate crimes and are worthy of

12330,SECTION CXV.,"to act cruelly even by them who take delight in killing men, although"
12331,SECTION CXV.,"they commit various iniquitous deeds.’"" Being thus addressed by Sitā,"
12332,SECTION CXV.,"Hanumān, skilled in speech, spoke unto the blameless Rāma’s spouse,"
12333,SECTION CXV.,"saying—""Thou art the worthy spouse of Rāma, religiously wedded and"
12334,SECTION CXV.,"crowned with many qualities. Permit me, O worshipful dame, to proceed"
12335,SECTION CXV.,"where Rāghava is"". Being thus accosted by Hanumān, Vaidehi, the daughter"
12336,SECTION CXV.,"of king Janaka, said,—""I wish to see my lord, ever fond of those who are"
12337,SECTION CXV.,"devoted unto him"". Hearing these words, the high-minded Hanumān, the son"
12338,SECTION CXV.,"of Maruta, pleasing Maithili said—""Thou shalt behold Rāma, having a"
12339,SECTION CXV.,"countenance like the full moon, with Lakshmana, surrounded by his"
12340,SECTION CXV.,friends and having his enemies slain as Sachi beholdeth Indra the king

12342,SECTION CXV.,herself the highly effulgent Hanumān returned where Rāghava was.
12343,SECTION CXV.,"Thereupon Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys, related duly all what did"

12354,SECTION CXVI.,"Thereupon bowing unto Rāma, the foremost of bow-men, having eyes"
12355,SECTION CXVI.,"resembling lotus-petals, the highly wise monkey said,—""It behoveth thee"
12356,SECTION CXVI.,"now to see Maithilee, stricken with grief for whom thou didst initiate"
12357,SECTION CXVI.,all these works and the fruit whereof hath now been attained. Hearing of
12358,SECTION CXVI.,"thy victory Maithilee, possessed by grief and having eyes full of tears,"
12359,SECTION CXVI.,"expressed her desire to see thee. And I was told by her, confident of"
12360,SECTION CXVI.,"her previous trust, with profuse tears in her eyes,—""I wish to see my"
12361,SECTION CXVI.,"husband"". Being addressed by Hanumān, Rāma the foremost of the pious"
12362,SECTION CXVI.,"being bathed in tears, engaged instantly in meditation. Thereupon"
12363,SECTION CXVI.,sighing hard and casting his looks upon the ground he spoke unto
12364,SECTION CXVI.,"Bibhishana resembling clouds, who was near him. ""Do thou speedily bring"
12365,SECTION CXVI.,"Sitā here—the daughter of the king of Mithilā—bathed, sprinkled with"
12366,SECTION CXVI.,"celestial paste and adorned with celestial ornaments"". Being thus"
12367,SECTION CXVI.,"addressed by Rāma, Bibhishana hastened on and entering the inner"
12368,SECTION CXVI.,appartment sent information unto Sitā through the female attendants. And
12369,SECTION CXVI.,"beholding the great Sitā, the graceful lord of Rākshasas—Bibhishana,"
12370,SECTION CXVI.,"humbly and placing his joined palms on his crown, said,—""O Vaidehi, may"
12371,SECTION CXVI.,good betide thee; sprinkled with celestial paste and adorned with
12372,SECTION CXVI.,celestials ornaments do thou ascend this car; thy husband wisheth to see
12373,SECTION CXVI.,"thee"". Being thus addressed Vaidehi replied unto Bibhishana,—""O lord of"
12374,SECTION CXVI.,"Rākshasas, without bathing even I wish to see my husband"". Hearing those"
12375,SECTION CXVI.,"words Bibhishana replied,—""It behoveth thee to do what thy lord Rāma"
12376,SECTION CXVI.,"hath said"". Whereto the chaste Maithilee, regarding her husband as God"
12377,SECTION CXVI.,"and filled with devotion unto her husband, replied saying ""So be it""."
12378,SECTION CXVI.,"Thereupon placing Sitā, bathed, performing the due rites wearing"
12379,SECTION CXVI.,"valuable clothes and adorned with valuable ornaments, on a palanquin,"
12380,SECTION CXVI.,"carried by many a capable Rākshasa, brought her (unto Rāma). Thereupon"
12381,SECTION CXVI.,"approaching the high-souled Rāma, who, being informed of (Bibhishana’s"
12382,SECTION CXVI.,"approach) was engaged in meditation, Bibhishana bowing down and"
12383,SECTION CXVI.,delighted communicated unto him the arrival of Sitā. And hearing of her
12384,SECTION CXVI.,"arrival who had lived long in the abode of the Rākshasa Rāghava, the"
12385,SECTION CXVI.,"slayer of enemies attained (simultaneously) to anger, delight and"
12386,SECTION CXVI.,"depression. And considering Sitā, who was in the patanquin, over-whelmed"
12387,SECTION CXVI.,"with grief, Rāghava delighted addressed Bibhishana with the following"
12388,SECTION CXVI.,"words. ""O lord of Rākshasas, O gentle (king), O thou ever engaged in"
12389,SECTION CXVI.,"encompassing my success, do thou speedily bring Vaidehi nearer to me""."
12390,SECTION CXVI.,"Hearing these words of Rāghava, Bibhishana, conversant with piety"
12391,SECTION CXVI.,speedily cleared (the people out of that place). And attendants with
12392,SECTION CXVI.,armours and head-dresses on and with cane and drums in their hands began
12393,SECTION CXVI.,"to move about driving away the crowd thereform. And the crowds of bears,"
12394,SECTION CXVI.,monkeys and Rākshasas being driven on all sides began to fly at a
12395,SECTION CXVI.,distance. And they being thus driven there arose a huge noise resembling
12396,SECTION CXVI.,that of the ocean when agitated by the wind. Beholding the monkeys
12397,SECTION CXVI.,"driven on all sides and troubled, Rāghava out of anger and compassion"
12398,SECTION CXVI.,prevented him. And thereupon as if burning (every thing) with his angry
12399,SECTION CXVI.,eyes Rāma addressed the highly intelligent Bibhishana with the following
12400,SECTION CXVI.,"angry words—""Why dost thou insult me by destroying all these? Do thou"
12401,SECTION CXVI.,"remove their anxiety—they are all my own men. Neither the houses,"
12402,SECTION CXVI.,"clothes, walls nor reception like these are the veils of women. There is"
12403,SECTION CXVI.,"no sin consequent upon seeing women in danger, difficulty, war,"
12404,SECTION CXVI.,_Svyambara_⁴⁷⁵ sacrifice and marriage. She is now in great danger and
12405,SECTION CXVI.,difficulty—there is no sin in seeing her specially in my presence.
12406,SECTION CXVI.,Therefore leaving behind the palanquin let her come here on foot and let
12407,SECTION CXVI.,"the monkeys behold Vaidehi in my presence"". Being thus addressed by"
12408,SECTION CXVI.,"Rāma, Bibbishana, being sorry, humbly brought Sitā near him. There-upon"
12409,SECTION CXVI.,"bearing Rāma’s accents, Lakshmana, Sugriva and the monkey Hanumān were"
12410,SECTION CXVI.,"greatly sorry. As if hiding herself in her own person in shame Maithili,"
12411,SECTION CXVI.,"following Bibhishana, approached her husband. And she, having a gentle"
12412,SECTION CXVI.,"countetiance and always regarding her husband as her god, fixed her"
12413,SECTION CXVI.,"looks upon her lord’s face out of surprise, joy and love. And beholding"
12414,SECTION CXVI.,"the gentle countenance of her dearest lord, resembling the full moon she"
12415,SECTION CXVI.,removed her mental distress. Thereupon she appeared (beautiful) having
12416,SECTION CXVI.,the countenance of the clear moon.

12428,SECTION CXVII.,arena of battle I have subdued thy enemy—I have done all that can be
12429,SECTION CXVII.,"accomplished by manliness. I have reached the other end of my anger,"
12430,SECTION CXVII.,rubbed off (the insult) for my spouse being taken away by the enemy and
12431,SECTION CXVII.,have killed simultaneously my disgrace and enemy. My manliness hath been
12432,SECTION CXVII.,"displayed to-day, my labour hath been crowned with success and to-day I"
12433,SECTION CXVII.,"have fulfilled my promise by my own prowess. That accidental misfortune,"
12434,SECTION CXVII.,under the influence whereof thou wert carried away by the fickle-minded
12435,SECTION CXVII.,"Rākshasa in my absence, hath been subdued to-day by me, a man. What is"
12436,SECTION CXVII.,"the use of his manliness, who when insulted, cannot remove it? Even if"
12437,SECTION CXVII.,he be a great man he may be called mean. The praise-worthy works of
12438,SECTION CXVII.,"Hanumān—the crossing of the deep and the devastation of Lankā, have been"
12439,SECTION CXVII.,"crowned with success to-day. The labour of Sugriva with his army, who"
12440,SECTION CXVII.,"displayed valour in the encounter and gave me good counsels, hath borne"
12441,SECTION CXVII.,fruit to-day. To-day also the labour of Bibhishana hath borne fruit—who
12442,SECTION CXVII.,"renouncing his brother, devoid of all good qualities, came to my side""."
12443,SECTION CXVII.,"Hearing those words of Rāma, Sitā began to look wistfully like a hind,"
12444,SECTION CXVII.,with eyes full of tears. And beholding his beloved spouse near him and
12445,SECTION CXVII.,afraid of popular ignominy his heart was broken into two. Thereupon he
12446,SECTION CXVII.,"spoke unto the exquisitely beautiful Sitā, in the midst of the monkeys"
12447,SECTION CXVII.,"and Rākshasas, having eyes resembling lotus-petals and black and curling"
12448,SECTION CXVII.,"hairs, saying,—""As the southern quarter, incapable of being got at by"
12449,SECTION CXVII.,"the people, was conquered by the self-controlled great ascetic Agastya,"
12450,SECTION CXVII.,"so for thee slaying Rāvana, I, (always) anxious to have honour, have"
12451,SECTION CXVII.,removed my insult—as is the duty of a man. May good betide thee—do thou
12452,SECTION CXVII.,"know that all my labour, in the battle-field, backed by the prowess of"
12453,SECTION CXVII.,"my friends, is for thee, To uphold the dignity of my well-known family,"
12454,SECTION CXVII.,to remove the ignominy consequent upon thy being stolen away as well as
12455,SECTION CXVII.,to wipe off my own insult I have encompassed this. I have suspected thy
12456,SECTION CXVII.,"character; thou, (therefore) standing before me, art distressing me like"
12457,SECTION CXVII.,unto a lamp before one who is subject to an eye-disease. Do thou
12458,SECTION CXVII.,"therefore proceed, daughter of king Janaka, wherever thou likest to one"
12459,SECTION CXVII.,"of these ten quarters. I permit thee, O gentle one. I have nothing to do"
12460,SECTION CXVII.,"with thee. What powerful man, born in a high family, take back his wife"
12461,SECTION CXVII.,"considering her as friend out of lust, who hath lived long in another’s"
12462,SECTION CXVII.,"house? Thou wert taken by Rāvana on his lap, beheld by him with sinful"
12463,SECTION CXVII.,"eyes; how can I, taking thee back, bring disgrace upon my great family?"
12464,SECTION CXVII.,"The object, with which I have gained thee back, hath been accomplished."
12465,SECTION CXVII.,"I have got no attachment for thee—do thou go wherever thou wishest,"
12466,SECTION CXVII.,gentle one. I speak these unto thee impelled by my sense of duty. If
12467,SECTION CXVII.,"thou wishest thou mayest live with Lakshmana, Bharata or Satrughna or"
12468,SECTION CXVII.,"with Sugriva or Rākshasa Bibhishana. Do thou settle, O Sitā, where you"
12469,SECTION CXVII.,"may find thy own pleasure. O Sitā, (I do not think) Rāvana hath"
12470,SECTION CXVII.,"overlooked thee, who lived in his house, beholding thee so graceful and"
12471,SECTION CXVII.,"beautiful"". Thereupon hearing those unpleasant words from her beloved"
12472,SECTION CXVII.,"(husband) Sitā, always sensitive and who had never heard such unpleasant"
12473,SECTION CXVII.,"words, trembling like a creeper torn by the trunk of an elephant, began"

12484,SECTION CXVIII.,if entering unto her own person (with shame) and greatly pained with
12485,SECTION CXVIII.,these arrow-like words the daughter of king Janaka began to shed tears.
12486,SECTION CXVIII.,"Thereupon wiping the tears off her countenance, she with sorrowful"
12487,SECTION CXVIII.,"words, addressed her husband—""Why dost thou, O hero, like a common man"
12488,SECTION CXVIII.,"addressing an ordinary woman, make me hear these harsh and unbecoming"
12489,SECTION CXVIII.,"words painful unto ears? O thou of long arms, I am not what thou hast"
12490,SECTION CXVIII.,taken me to be. Do thou believe me I do swear by my own character.
12491,SECTION CXVIII.,Seeing the ordinary women thou art distrusting the whole sex. Do thou
12492,SECTION CXVIII.,"renounce this suspicion since thou hast tried me. O lord, though my"
12493,SECTION CXVIII.,person was touched by another—but it was not in my power; nor was it an
12494,SECTION CXVIII.,wilful act (of mine); accident is to blame in this. My heart is under my
12495,SECTION CXVIII.,control and that is in thee;—and what could I do of my body which was
12496,SECTION CXVIII.,subject to another and of which I was not the mistress. O thou the
12497,SECTION CXVIII.,conferrer of honour—our affection towards one another was increased by
12498,SECTION CXVIII.,our living continually for a long time; even then if thou hast not been
12499,SECTION CXVIII.,"able to understand me I am ruined for ever. O king, when the great hero"
12500,SECTION CXVIII.,Hanumān was despatched by thee to Lankā to see me why didst thou not
12501,SECTION CXVIII.,renounce me then? Hadst thou deputed the monkey with that message I
12502,SECTION CXVIII.,"would have renounced my life there and then, O hero. Thou wouldst not"
12503,SECTION CXVIII.,have been required to undergo this toil at the risk of thy own life and
12504,SECTION CXVIII.,"giving unnecessary trouble to thy friends. O foremost of kings, being"
12505,SECTION CXVIII.,"subject to ire—thou dost not perceive anything but womanhood in me, like"
12506,SECTION CXVIII.,an ordinary man. Although I am known to have a father but in fact I am
12507,SECTION CXVIII.,"born of the earth. Thou dost not sufficiently honour my character, O"
12508,SECTION CXVIII.,thou conversant with characters. Thy marriage with me in boyhood shall
12509,SECTION CXVIII.,be disproved and thou art not sufficiently considering all my devotion
12510,SECTION CXVIII.,"and good conduct unto thee"". Saying thus with accents choked in tears"
12511,SECTION CXVIII.,"and weeping Sitā spoke unto Lakshmana, poorly and engaged in meditation."
12512,SECTION CXVIII.,"""Make a funeral pyre for me, O Saumitri, that is the only remedy for"
12513,SECTION CXVIII.,this disaster. Being thus branded with an unfounded stigma I do not like
12514,SECTION CXVIII.,to keep my life. To adopt the proper course for me who had been
12515,SECTION CXVIII.,renounced before this assembly by my disaffected husband I shall enter
12516,SECTION CXVIII.,"this"". Being thus addressed by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, the slayer of"
12517,SECTION CXVIII.,"enemies, being possessed by anger, looked towards Rāghava. And"
12518,SECTION CXVIII.,understanding Rāma’s intention by gestures and at his command the
12519,SECTION CXVIII.,"powerful Saumitri prepared a funeral pyre. None dared there request,"
12520,SECTION CXVIII.,speak with or even look at Rāma like unto Death at the time of
12521,SECTION CXVIII.,"dissolution. Thereupon circumambulating Rāma, standing with his head"
12522,SECTION CXVIII.,"down, Vaidehi approached the burning fire. And bowing unto the"
12523,SECTION CXVIII.,"celestials and Brāhmanas, Maithili, with folded hands, spoke before the"
12524,SECTION CXVIII.,"fire:—""As my heart hath never gone away from Rāghava, may thou protect"
12525,SECTION CXVIII.,"me, O fire, the witness of the people. As Rāghava considereth me vile,"
12526,SECTION CXVIII.,"who have got a pure character, may fire, the witness of the people,"
12527,SECTION CXVIII.,"protect me on all sides"". Saying this and going round the fire, Vaidehi,"
12528,SECTION CXVIII.,"with undaunted heart, entered the flaming fire. The great assembly"
12529,SECTION CXVIII.,"there, young and old, overwhelmed with grief, saw Maithili enter the"
12530,SECTION CXVIII.,flaming fire. And (Sitā) resembling the burning gold entered the flaming
12531,SECTION CXVIII.,"fire in the presence of all people. All beheld Sitā, having expansive"
12532,SECTION CXVIII.,"eyes, enter fire like unto a golden altar. The ascetics, celestials and"
12533,SECTION CXVIII.,Gandharbas saw that great damsel enter fire like unto a full oblation in
12534,SECTION CXVIII.,the sacrifice. And beholding her fallen into the fire like unto
12535,SECTION CXVIII.,"_Vasudhārā_, sanctified by Mantras in a sacrifice, all the females began"
12536,SECTION CXVIII.,"to weep. And the three worlds—the celestials, Gandharbas and Dānavas saw"
12537,SECTION CXVIII.,her fallen like unto a celestial from the heaven when imprecited. She
12538,SECTION CXVIII.,"having entered the fire, lamentations, unheard of before, rose from all"

12555,SECTION CXIX.,"with various ornaments and folding them, those foremost of the"
12556,SECTION CXIX.,"celestials said unto Rāghava—""O lord, thou art the preserver of all the"

12558,SECTION CXIX.,into fire? Why dost thou not understand thyself the foremost of the

12560,SECTION CXIX.,"name of Kratadhāma. And thou art thyself, O lord, the creator of the"
12561,SECTION CXIX.,three worlds. Thou art the eighth of the _Rudras_⁴⁷⁷ and the fifth of
12562,SECTION CXIX.,the _Sādkyas_;⁴⁷⁸ the Açwinis are thy two ears and the sun and the moon

12566,SECTION CXIX.,"Rāghava, the lord of people and the foremost of the pious, spoke unto"
12567,SECTION CXIX.,"those leading celestials, saying:—""I know myself to be man—Rāma, the son"

12569,SECTION CXIX.,"have come"". Thereupon Brahmā, the foremost of those conversant with the"

12648,SECTION CXX.,Hearing those excellent words uttered by the great Patriarch rose up
12649,SECTION CXX.,_Bibhābasu_⁴⁸⁶ with Vaidehi on his lap shaking the funeral pyre. With
12650,SECTION CXX.,"the daughter of the king Janaka, the receiver⁴⁸⁷ of sacrificial"
12651,SECTION CXX.,"offerings, being incarnate, rose up. And carrying on his lap Vaidehi,"
12652,SECTION CXX.,"wearing a red cloth, resembling the newly risen sun, adorned with"
12653,SECTION CXX.,ornaments of burning gold—having black curling hairs and decked with
12654,SECTION CXX.,"fresh garments, _Bibhābasu_ gave her unto Rāma. Thereupon the Deity of"
12655,SECTION CXX.,"Fire, the witness of the people, spoke unto Rāma, saying—""O Rāma, here"
12656,SECTION CXX.,"is thy Vaidehi—no sin hath visited her. Neither by words, mind,"
12657,SECTION CXX.,"understanding nor eyes, she, good-natured and beautiful—hath deviated"
12658,SECTION CXX.,from thee who hath got a good character and is heroic. She was in the
12659,SECTION CXX.,"solitary forest separated from thee, poorly and having no control over"
12660,SECTION CXX.,herself and hence she was carried away by the Rākshasa Rāvana having
12661,SECTION CXX.,enough prowess in him. Although shut up in the inner appartment—well
12662,SECTION CXX.,protected and guarded by the dreadful she-demons she had always her mind
12663,SECTION CXX.,in thee and was devoted unto thee. Although tempted in many a way and
12664,SECTION CXX.,remonstrated with she did not think of that Rākshasa in her inner mind.
12665,SECTION CXX.,Her heart is pure and she is not spoiled with sin—do thou therefore take
12666,SECTION CXX.,"back Maithili. Do thou not speak other-wise—I do command thee""."
12667,SECTION CXX.,"Thereupon hearing those words—the virtuous-souled Rāma, the foremost of"
12668,SECTION CXX.,"those skilled in speech, with his eyes agitated with delight, meditated"
12669,SECTION CXX.,"for sometime. Being thus addressed, the highly effulgent and intelligent"
12670,SECTION CXX.,"Rāma, of unmitigated prowess—the foremost of the pious, spoke unto that"
12671,SECTION CXX.,"best of celestials saying—""Beautiful (Sitā) lived in the inner"
12672,SECTION CXX.,appartment of Rāvana for a long time so she needs this purification in
12673,SECTION CXX.,the presence of all people. If I would take the daughter of Janaka
12674,SECTION CXX.,"without purifying her, people would say that Rāma the son of king"
12675,SECTION CXX.,Daçaratha is lustful and ignorant of the morality of the people. I know
12676,SECTION CXX.,"it full well that Maithili, the daughter of king Janaka, hath her mind"
12677,SECTION CXX.,devoted unto me and hath not given it to anyone (else). As the ocean
12678,SECTION CXX.,cannot go beyond its banks so Rāvana could not approach her having
12679,SECTION CXX.,expansive eyes protected by virtue of her own chastity. The greatly
12680,SECTION CXX.,"vicious-souled one could not even by his mind get Maithili, who was"
12681,SECTION CXX.,beyond his reach like unto the burning flame of fire. Her mind could not
12682,SECTION CXX.,have been moved although she lived in the inner appartment of Rāvana—she
12683,SECTION CXX.,belongs to none else; Sitā is mine as the rays belong to the Sun.
12684,SECTION CXX.,Maithili—the daughter of Janaka hath been purified before the three
12685,SECTION CXX.,worlds—So I am incapable of renouncing her as a self-controlled person
12686,SECTION CXX.,cannot forsake his (own) reputation. It behoveth me to carry out the
12687,SECTION CXX.,well-meaning words of you all—the lords of people who have spoken them
12688,SECTION CXX.,"out of affection"". Saying this, the victorious, highly powerful, well"
12689,SECTION CXX.,"renowned Rāghava, worthy of enjoying happiness, and having his praise"
12690,SECTION CXX.,"chanted in consequence of his noble action, regaining his spouse,"

12707,SECTION CXXI.,"darkness—the fear of all people—Rāvana, hath been removed by thee in the"

12709,SECTION CXXI.,"Kaikeyi and Sumitrā the mother of Lakshmana, obtaining the kingdom of"
12710,SECTION CXXI.,"Ayodhyā, pleasing all thy friends, establishing the prestige of thy"

12714,SECTION CXXI.,"thy superior on this earth, O Kākutstha. Obtaining thee as his son, that"
12715,SECTION CXXI.,graceful (king) hath repaired to the region of Indra. Do thou bow unto
12716,SECTION CXXI.,"him with thy brother Lakshmana"". Hearing the words of Mahādeva, Rāghava,"
12717,SECTION CXXI.,"along with Lakshmana, bowed unto their father who was seated on the top"
12718,SECTION CXXI.,of the car. He with Lakshmana beheld their father shining in his own
12719,SECTION CXXI.,effulgence and wearing an unsullied cloth. Thereupon beholding his son
12720,SECTION CXXI.,"dearer than his life, attaining great delight (in consequence thereof)"
12721,SECTION CXXI.,"placing him on his lap and embracing him with his arms, the great king"
12722,SECTION CXXI.,"Daçaratha, having long arms and seated on an excellent seat in the car,"
12723,SECTION CXXI.,"said—""I am now in heaven and am equal with the celestials, but without"
12724,SECTION CXXI.,"thee, O Rāma, I do not like it—this is true—I do swear by thee. O thou"
12725,SECTION CXXI.,"the foremost of those skilled in speech, I have still in my mind the"
12726,SECTION CXXI.,words which were uttered by Kaikeyi for sending thee away to the woods.
12727,SECTION CXXI.,Beholding thee all well and embracing thee with Lakshmana I am now shorn
12728,SECTION CXXI.,"of grief like unto the sun, devoid of dues. I have been emancipated, O"
12729,SECTION CXXI.,"my son, through thee—a good and high-souled son, as the virtuous-souled"
12730,SECTION CXXI.,"Brahmana Kapāla was by Asthabakra. O gentle one, I have heard from the"
12731,SECTION CXXI.,"celestials, (that thou art) the excellent Purusha in the guise (of a"
12732,SECTION CXXI.,"man) for the destruction of Rāvana. Blessed is Kauçalyā, O Rāma, who"
12733,SECTION CXXI.,"shall be greatly delighted, on beholding thee, the slayer of enemies,"
12734,SECTION CXXI.,"gone home from the forest. Blessed are those men, O Rāma, who shall"
12735,SECTION CXXI.,behold thee installed in the city as the king of the world. I wish to
12736,SECTION CXXI.,"behold thee reconciled with Bharata, devoted powerful, pure and"
12737,SECTION CXXI.,"performing pious observances. O gentle one, thou hast spent fourteen"
12738,SECTION CXXI.,years in the forest with Sitā and Lakshmana. The term of thy exile is
12739,SECTION CXXI.,"over—thy promise hath been fulfilled; and slaying Rāvana, in the"
12740,SECTION CXXI.,conflict thou hast pleased the celestials. Thou hast performed a mighty
12741,SECTION CXXI.,"deed and attained to excellent fame, O slayer of enemies; and placed in"
12742,SECTION CXXI.,"charge of thy kingdom do thou with thy brothers attain a long life"". The"
12743,SECTION CXXI.,"king speaking thus Rāma spoke unto him with folded hands saying,—""O thou"
12744,SECTION CXXI.,"conversant with piety, do thou be propitiated with Bharata and Kaikeyi."
12745,SECTION CXXI.,"Thou didst imprecate Kaikeyi, saying,—""I renounce thee with thy son""—may"
12746,SECTION CXXI.,"not that dreadful curse visit her and her son"". Saying ""so be it"" unto"
12747,SECTION CXXI.,Rāma with folded hands and embracing Lakshmana the great king said to
12748,SECTION CXXI.,"him:—""O thou conversant with piety and fame on this earth, thou shall"
12749,SECTION CXXI.,attain to heaven and excellent state there. O thou the enhancer of
12750,SECTION CXXI.,Sumitrā’s joy—do thou attend upon Rāma; may good betide thee; Rāma is
12751,SECTION CXXI.,ever engaged in the welfare of all beings. All these celestials headed
12752,SECTION CXXI.,"by Indra, Siddhas and Great saints, bowing unto this high-souled and"
12753,SECTION CXXI.,"excellent Purusha, worship him. Rāma, the subduer of foes, is the"
12754,SECTION CXXI.,"indescribable and undecaying letter _Brahma_, which has, been described"
12755,SECTION CXXI.,(in the Vedas) as the heart and secret of the celestials. For serving
12756,SECTION CXXI.,"him along with Sitā, the daughter of king of Videha, thou hast attained"
12757,SECTION CXXI.,"piety and excellent fame"". Addressing Lakshmana thus, the king spoke"
12758,SECTION CXXI.,"unto his daughter-in-law, who was standing before him with folded hands,"
12759,SECTION CXXI.,"saying:—""It doth not behove thee, O Vaidehi, to be enraged (with Rāma)"
12760,SECTION CXXI.,for renouncing thee; for purifying thee this was done by him ever
12761,SECTION CXXI.,"wishing thy welfare. What thou hast performed, O daughter, to establish"
12762,SECTION CXXI.,"the purity of thy character, is hard to perform. What thou hast done,"
12763,SECTION CXXI.,shall glorify all other females. Though there is no necessity for giving
12764,SECTION CXXI.,thee any instruction as regards thy duty towards thy husband-still I
12765,SECTION CXXI.,"should say that he is thy great god"". Having thus instructed his two"
12766,SECTION CXXI.,"sons and Sitā, he repaired, in his car, to the region of Indra. Having"
12767,SECTION CXXI.,"advised his two sons along with Sitā, ascending the car, and shining in"

12784,SECTION CXXII.,"despatched to the abode of Death, on my account, regaining their life,"
12785,SECTION CXXII.,"stand up. O thou the conferror of honour, I wish to see all those"
12786,SECTION CXXII.,"delighted monkeys, who were separated from their wives and children on"
12787,SECTION CXXII.,"my account. O Purandara, do thou revive all these heroic and powerful"

12798,SECTION CXXII.,"never be falsified, so let them be be fulfilled. Let all those bears and"
12799,SECTION CXXII.,Golangulas rise up who were slain in the conflict by Rākshasas and had
12800,SECTION CXXII.,their heads and arms severed. Let the monkeys gifted with their pristine
12801,SECTION CXXII.,strength and prowess rise up unhurt and healthy as if after the end of

12803,SECTION CXXII.,"let them attain to excellent joy. O thou the wielder of a huge bow, all"

12809,SECTION CXXII.,"Kākutstha of accomplished, end and eulogizing Rāma and Lakshmana, all"
12810,SECTION CXXII.,"the celestials, greatly delighted, said,—""Do thou, O king, repair to"

12931,SECTION CXXIV.,"accosted by the monkeys with Bibhishana, the virtuous-souled Rāma, spoke"
12932,SECTION CXXIV.,"unto them and Sugriva and Bibhishana, saying—""Dearer than the dear, I"
12933,SECTION CXXIV.,"shall attain to, when returning my city, along with you all, I shall"
12934,SECTION CXXIV.,"enjoy in the company of all my friends and relatives. O Sugriva, do thou"
12935,SECTION CXXIV.,"soon ascend the car along with the monkeys. Do thou ascend too, O"
12936,SECTION CXXIV.,"Bibhishana, lord of Rākshasas, with all thy courtiers"". Thereupon"
12937,SECTION CXXIV.,"ascended that celestial car _Pushpaka_, Sugriva, greatly delighted with"
12938,SECTION CXXIV.,"the monkeys and Bibhishana, with his courtiers. And they all having got"
12939,SECTION CXXIV.,"up, the excellent car, of Kuvera at the command of Rāghava, rose up in"
12940,SECTION CXXIV.,the welkin. And in that car coursing at will and drawn by effulgent
12941,SECTION CXXIV.,"ganders, Rāma greatly delighted appeared like Kuvera (himself). And all"
12942,SECTION CXXIV.,"the monkeys, bears and the highly powerful Rākshasas sat in that"
12943,SECTION CXXIV.,celestial car unobstructed and at their pleasure.

12950,SECTION CXXV.,"Being commanded by Rāma, that excellent car, drawn by ganders, with a"
12951,SECTION CXXV.,"huge noise, rose high up in the welkin. And casting his looks on all"
12952,SECTION CXXV.,"sides, Rāma, the descendant of Raghus, spake unto Sitā, the daughter of"
12953,SECTION CXXV.,"the king of Mithilā, having a moon-like countenance, saying,—""O Vaidehi,"
12954,SECTION CXXV.,"do thou behold Lankā, situate on the summit of the mount Chitrakuta,"
12955,SECTION CXXV.,"resembling that of Kailāça and constructed by _Viçwakarmā_. And behold,"
12956,SECTION CXXV.,"O Sitā, that huge arena of battle, bathed in the blood and flesh of the"
12957,SECTION CXXV.,"monkeys and Rākshasas. Do thou behold, O thou having expansive eyes,"
12958,SECTION CXXV.,"Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, the repressor of people and who obtained"
12959,SECTION CXXV.,"a boon, lying there, slain by me on thy account. Kumbhakarna was slain"
12960,SECTION CXXV.,"there, the night-ranger Prahasta, as well, and Dumrāksha, were slain by"
12961,SECTION CXXV.,the monkey Hanumān. Bidyutmāli was slain there by the high-souled
12962,SECTION CXXV.,"Sushena—and Indrajit, the son of Rāvana, was slain there in the"
12963,SECTION CXXV.,"encounter, by Lakshmana. The Rākshasa named Bikata was slain there by"
12964,SECTION CXXV.,"Angadi—and Birupāksha, hard to look at and Mahaparsha and Mahodara. And"
12965,SECTION CXXV.,the powerful Akampana was slain (there) and all other
12966,SECTION CXXV.,"Rākshasas—Trishirā, Alikāya, Devāntaka and Narantaka—and the two leading"
12967,SECTION CXXV.,"and powerful Rākshasas, mad after conflict—the sons of"
12968,SECTION CXXV.,"Kumbhakarna—Nikumbha and Kumbha, Bajradanstra, Danstra and many other"
12969,SECTION CXXV.,Rākshasas were slain and the irrepressible Makarāksha was slain (there)
12970,SECTION CXXV.,by me in the conflict. Akampana was slain—and the powerful Sonitāksha.
12971,SECTION CXXV.,And Yupāksha and Prajangha were destroyed (there) in the great conflict.
12972,SECTION CXXV.,The grim-visaged Rākshasa Viddutsjmha was slain there—and Yajnāsatru and
12973,SECTION CXXV.,the highly powerful Suptaghna. (And there was slain) Suryāsatru and
12974,SECTION CXXV.,"Brahmasatru. (And there bewailed for Rāvana) his spouse Mandodari,"
12975,SECTION CXXV.,surrounded by his thousand other wives. O thou having an excellent
12976,SECTION CXXV.,"countenance, do thou behold the descending place of the ocean, where I"
12977,SECTION CXXV.,spent the night after crossing the deep for thee. O thou having
12978,SECTION CXXV.,"expansive eyes, for thee, this difficult construction of the bridge was"
12979,SECTION CXXV.,"made by me over the deep by the help of Nala. Do thou, O Vaidehi, behold"
12980,SECTION CXXV.,"the unagitated deep—the abode of Varuna, appearing as if without the"
12981,SECTION CXXV.,"other end, roaring and abounding in conchs and pearl oysters. O"
12982,SECTION CXXV.,"Maithili, do thou behold the golden mount, which rose above the deep for"
12983,SECTION CXXV.,affording a resting place unto Hanumān. And on the bank of this ocean I
12984,SECTION CXXV.,"halted with my soldiers. And here Mahādeva, the lord of the celestials,"
12985,SECTION CXXV.,was propitiated with me. It behoveth thee to behold this descending
12986,SECTION CXXV.,"place of the high-souled Ocean, known as _Setubandha_,⁴⁸⁸ worshipped of"
12987,SECTION CXXV.,"the three worlds, highly sacred and destroying even the worst sin."
12988,SECTION CXXV.,"There, Bibhishana, the king of Rākshasas first came to me. Do thou"

12990,SECTION CXXV.,"of Sugriva, where Vāli was slain by me"". And beholding the city of"
12991,SECTION CXXV.,"Kishkindhā, ruled over by Vāli, Sitā, incited by her love, addressed"
12992,SECTION CXXV.,"Rāma, with worthy words, saying—""O king, I wish to repair to Ayodhyā thy"

12995,SECTION CXXV.,"Vaidehi Rāghava replied—saying, ""this shall be done"" and getting at"
12996,SECTION CXXV.,Kishkindhā he stopped the car. And having beheld the car stationed he
12997,SECTION CXXV.,"spoke unto Sugriva, saying—""O foremost of monkeys, do thou speak unto"
12998,SECTION CXXV.,all the leading monkeys that they may go to Ayodhyā accompanied by their
12999,SECTION CXXV.,wives. O thou of great strength—they may all go with Sitā. Do thou hurry
13000,SECTION CXXV.,"them on, O Sugriva. We shall (soon) go, O thou the lord of monkeys""."
13001,SECTION CXXV.,"Being thus addressed by Rāma, of unmitigated prowess—the beautiful lord"
13002,SECTION CXXV.,"of monkeys, encircled by them, entered speedily the inner apartment and"
13003,SECTION CXXV.,"beholding Tārā there, said—""O dear, at the command of Rāghava and the"
13004,SECTION CXXV.,"kind desire of Sitā, do thou soon go, taking with thee the wives of all"
13005,SECTION CXXV.,the high-souled monkeys. We shall see Ayodhyā and the wives of
13006,SECTION CXXV.,"Daçaratha"". Hearing the words of Sugriva, Tārā, having a perfectly"
13007,SECTION CXXV.,"beautiful person, assembling all the wives of the monkeys, said—""You"
13008,SECTION CXXV.,have been ordered by Sugriva to repair (to Ayodhyā) with the monkeys;—to
13009,SECTION CXXV.,"behold Ayodhyā, is also a dear object of mine. (I shall behold) Rāma"
13010,SECTION CXXV.,enter the city with the citizens and villagers and the wealth and riches

13012,SECTION CXXV.,"the monkeys, putting on all their ornaments and circumambulating (her)"
13013,SECTION CXXV.,"ascended the car, with a view to behold Sitā. And beholding the car"
13014,SECTION CXXV.,"going up with them all, Rāghava again spoke unto Sitā, near the mount"
13015,SECTION CXXV.,"Rishyamuka, saying,—""Do thou behold there, O Sitā, the huge and foremost"
13016,SECTION CXXV.,"mount Rishyamuka abounding in gold and various metals, like unto clouds"
13017,SECTION CXXV.,"accompanied with lightnings. There I was joined by Sugriva, the lord of"
13018,SECTION CXXV.,"monkeys. And there I entered into an agreement, O Sitā, for the"
13019,SECTION CXXV.,destruction of Vāli. And there is (the lake) Pampā abounding in lilies
13020,SECTION CXXV.,"and skirted by picturesque forest where separated from thee, I bewailed"
13021,SECTION CXXV.,piteously. And on its bank I beheld the pious _Savari_. And there I slew
13022,SECTION CXXV.,"_Kavandha_ and _Yoyanavāhu_. Behold there, O Sitā, a beautiful tree, in"
13023,SECTION CXXV.,"Janasthāna, where, O thou ever used to luxuries, for thee, the highly"
13024,SECTION CXXV.,"powerful and energetic Yatāyu, the foremost of birds, was slain by"
13025,SECTION CXXV.,"Rāvana. Do thou behold there, O thou of a beautiful person, O thou of"
13026,SECTION CXXV.,"auspicious looks, our hermitage and the beautiful cottage of leaves,"
13027,SECTION CXXV.,wherefrom thou hadst been carried away by force by the lord of
13028,SECTION CXXV.,Rākshasas. Do thou behold there the beautiful and sacred river Godāveri
13029,SECTION CXXV.,"having clear water and the hermitage of Agastya, surrounded by plantain"
13030,SECTION CXXV.,"trees. Do thou behold there, O Vaidehi, the great hermitage of"
13031,SECTION CXXV.,"_Sarabhanga_, where came the thousand-eyed, Sakra, the subduer of"
13032,SECTION CXXV.,"enemies’ cities. O worshipful dame, O thou having a middle"
13033,SECTION CXXV.,"stature—amongst all those ascetics, thou beholdest, there lived Atri,"
13034,SECTION CXXV.,the lord of our family—resembling the fire of the Sun. There was slain
13035,SECTION CXXV.,"the huge-bodied Birādha by me. There thou didst behold, O Sitā, the"
13036,SECTION CXXV.,female ascetic (the wife of Attri) ever performing pious observances.
13037,SECTION CXXV.,"There cometh in view, O thou having a beautiful person, the king of"
13038,SECTION CXXV.,"mountains, Chitrakuta, where to propitiate me, came the son of Sumitrā."
13039,SECTION CXXV.,"Behold the beautiful Yamunā, having picturesque forest on its bank and"
13040,SECTION CXXV.,the pleasant hermitage of Varadwāya. Behold there the sacred river
13041,SECTION CXXV.,"Ganges, dividing itself into three branches. Behold there the city of"
13042,SECTION CXXV.,"Sringabera, where I made friendship with Guha. Behold there, O Sitā, the"
13043,SECTION CXXV.,"capital of my father. Do thou bow unto Ayodhyā, O Vaidehi"". Thereupon"
13044,SECTION CXXV.,all the monkeys and Rākshasas along with Bibhishana rose up delightedly
13045,SECTION CXXV.,and saw the city. Thereupon the monkeys and Rākshasas beheld the city
13046,SECTION CXXV.,"abounding in white houses having spacious compartments, filled with"
13047,SECTION CXXV.,"elephants and horses and looking like Amarāvati, the capital of"
13048,SECTION CXXV.,Mahendra.

13061,SECTION CXXVI.,"elder brother of Lakshmana, arriving at the hermitage of Varadwāya on"
13062,SECTION CXXVI.,"the fifth day, saluted the ascetic. And bowing unto Varadwāya, having"
13063,SECTION CXXVI.,"asceticism for his wealth, he said,—""O thou gifted with six sorts of"
13064,SECTION CXXVI.,"wealth, hast thou heard of the prosperity and well being (of my city)?"
13065,SECTION CXXVI.,Is Bharata still engaged (in guarding the people)? Are my mothers
13066,SECTION CXXVI.,"living?"" Being thus addressed by Rāma the great ascetic Varadwāya"
13067,SECTION CXXVI.,"replied, delighted, and smiling, unto that foremost of Raghus,—""Abiding"
13068,SECTION CXXVI.,"by thy command and with matted locks, Bharata is waiting for thee,"
13069,SECTION CXXVI.,always honoring thy sandals. And all others are well in thy house. O
13070,SECTION CXXVI.,"subduer of thy enemies, I was greatly pained, when I saw thee before"
13071,SECTION CXXVI.,"entering the huge forest, wearing bark, three with thy wife,⁴⁸⁹ deprived"
13072,SECTION CXXVI.,"of thy kingdom for piety only, walking on foot, renouncing every thing,"

13076,SECTION CXXVI.,"accomplished end, with all thy friends having vanquished the enemy, I"
13077,SECTION CXXVI.,"have attained to highest delight. O Rāghava, I am apprised of immense"
13078,SECTION CXXVI.,griefs and happinesses which befell thee when thou didst live in
13079,SECTION CXXVI.,Janasthāna. Thy blameless spouse was carried away stealthily by Rāvana
13080,SECTION CXXVI.,"engaged as thou wert in the behoof of the Brāhmanas, and in the"
13081,SECTION CXXVI.,protection of all the ascetics. The view of Māricha—the carrying away of

13083,SECTION CXXVI.,"Pampā,—thy friendship with Sugriva, where Vāli was slain by thee,—the"
13084,SECTION CXXVI.,"enquiry of Vaidehi undertaken by the son of Wind-god,—the construction"
13085,SECTION CXXVI.,of the bridge by Nala after the whereabouts of Vaidehi had been
13086,SECTION CXXVI.,known—the conflagration of Lankā by the delighted and the leading
13087,SECTION CXXVI.,"monkeys—the destruction, in the conflict, of Rāvana proud of his own"
13088,SECTION CXXVI.,"strength, along with his sons, friends, courtiers, army and steeds—the"
13089,SECTION CXXVI.,"arrival of the celestials on the destruction of Rāvana, the thorn of"
13090,SECTION CXXVI.,gods and the grant of boon by them—I have known all these by virtue of
13091,SECTION CXXVI.,"my asceticism, O thou fond of virtue. My disciples used to go hence to"
13092,SECTION CXXVI.,"that city to bring tidings. I shall even now grant thee a boon, O"
13093,SECTION CXXVI.,foremost of those using weapons. Do thou accept my _Arghya_⁴⁹⁰ and then
13094,SECTION CXXVI.,"repair to Ayodhyā to-morrow"". And respectfully abiding by his words,"
13095,SECTION CXXVI.,"that effulgent son of the king, delighted, begged of him the boon. ""O"
13096,SECTION CXXVI.,"thou gifted with six qualities, on my way while proceeding to Ayodhyā,"
13097,SECTION CXXVI.,"let all the trees, bearing fruits out of season, and producing honey,"
13098,SECTION CXXVI.,"bear many a nectar-smelling fruit"". No sooner he replied saying,—""Thy"
13099,SECTION CXXVI.,"promise shall be fulfilled"" than all the trees there became like those"
13100,SECTION CXXVI.,of heaven. Trees without fruits were filled therewithal and trees
13101,SECTION CXXVI.,"without flowers were covered with them. All the trees, whose leaves were"
13102,SECTION CXXVI.,"dried up, were enveloped with foliage and all of them began to pour"
13103,SECTION CXXVI.,honey. The way to Ayodhyā for three _yojanas_ was thus filled all over
13104,SECTION CXXVI.,"(with trees). Thereupon thousands of monkeys, living, at pleasure and"

13121,SECTION CXXVII.,"cast his looks towards the monkeys and spoke unto Hanumān, saying,—""O"
13122,SECTION CXXVII.,"foremost of monkeys, speedily reparing to Ayodhyā do thou learn of the"
13123,SECTION CXXVII.,welfare of all people in the palace of the king. Arriving at the city of

13128,SECTION CXXVII.,"_Nishadhas_, delighted, shall inform thee of the way to Ayodhyā and the"
13129,SECTION CXXVII.,well being of Bharata. Do thou ask of Bharata his well-being at my
13130,SECTION CXXVII.,"words, and communicate unto him my (arrival) with Lakshmana and my"
13131,SECTION CXXVII.,spouse after having made good the vow (of my sire)—the carrying away of
13132,SECTION CXXVII.,Sitā by the powerful Rāvana—the friendship with Sugriva and the
13133,SECTION CXXVII.,destruction of Vāli in the conflict—the search of Maithili instituted by
13134,SECTION CXXVII.,thee having got over the huge lord of rivers—the advance (of the

13136,SECTION CXXVII.,"construction of the bridge—the destruction of Rāvana,—the grant of boon"
13137,SECTION CXXVII.,"by Mahendra, Brahmā and Varuna—my meeting with my father by the favour"
13138,SECTION CXXVII.,"of Mahādeva. Do thou, O gentle one, communicate unto Bharata, my arrival"
13139,SECTION CXXVII.,here with the lord of Rākshasas and king of monkeys. (Tell him)
13140,SECTION CXXVII.,’vanquishing his foes and attaining to excellent fame Rāma hath arrived
13141,SECTION CXXVII.,"at the gate of the city with his valiant friends, having satisfied the"
13142,SECTION CXXVII.,vow (of his sire).’ Thou shouldst read the signs expressive of joy or
13143,SECTION CXXVII.,sorrow that Bharata shall display on hearing this and infer therefrom
13144,SECTION CXXVII.,"his attitude towards me. Thou shouldst know, from the colour of his"

13150,SECTION CXXVII.,"Therefore, O monkey, it behoveth thee to come back speedily apprised of"
13151,SECTION CXXVII.,"his intention and movements, before we proceed further"". Being thus"
13152,SECTION CXXVII.,"commanded, Hanumān, the son of Wind-god, assuming a human shape speedily"
13153,SECTION CXXVII.,proceeded towards Ayodhyā. Hanumān the son of Māruta rose up in the
13154,SECTION CXXVII.,welkin with velocity like unto Gāruda ready to fall upon a huge serpent.
13155,SECTION CXXVII.,"Then crossing the Wind-path and the abode of the birds, getting over the"
13156,SECTION CXXVII.,"terrible confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā, reaching the city of"

13161,SECTION CXXVII.,"till to-day, he, having obtained permission from the ascetic"
13162,SECTION CXXVII.,"_Varadwāja_, shall proceed to-morrow"". Having said this the highly"
13163,SECTION CXXVII.,"energetic monkey, not caring for the exhaustion of travel, greatly"
13164,SECTION CXXVII.,"delighted and with hairs erect, rose up with great velocity. Beholding"
13165,SECTION CXXVII.,"the holy river sanctified with the name of Parasurāma, the"
13166,SECTION CXXVII.,"rivers—Bālukini, Baruthi, Gomati, the huge forest of _Sāla_ trees, the"
13167,SECTION CXXVII.,"various countries populated with thousands of people, and proceeding a"
13168,SECTION CXXVII.,"great distance speedily, that foremost of monkeys got at the trees near"
13169,SECTION CXXVII.,"_Nandigrām_⁴⁹³ like unto those of Chaitraratha, the garden of the lord"
13170,SECTION CXXVII.,of celestials the flowers whereof were being plucked off by many a
13171,SECTION CXXVII.,damsel accompanied by their children decked in various ornaments. He saw
13172,SECTION CXXVII.,"at a distance of one _crosa_ from Ayodhyā, Bharata wearing the skin of"
13173,SECTION CXXVII.,"an antelope, poorly, greatly reduced, living in a hermitage, wearing"
13174,SECTION CXXVII.,"matted hairs, having his body covered with dirt, greatly pulled down in"
13175,SECTION CXXVII.,"consequence of his brother’s disaster, living on roots and fruits,"
13176,SECTION CXXVII.,"self-controlled; living the life of an ascetic, observing pious"
13177,SECTION CXXVII.,"observances, with a bundle of clotted hairs on his head, wearing bark"
13178,SECTION CXXVII.,"and deer skin, having control over his passions and senses, effulgent"
13179,SECTION CXXVII.,"like _Brahmarshis_, ruling the earth always placing the sandals before"
13180,SECTION CXXVII.,"him, protecting people of four _Varnas_ against all fear, with"
13181,SECTION CXXVII.,"courtiers, priests leading a holy life and soldiers all wearing red"
13182,SECTION CXXVII.,"clothes; around him. All those citizens, fond of piety, did not like to"
13183,SECTION CXXVII.,use good clothes beholding the prince use bark and deer skin. Thereupon
13184,SECTION CXXVII.,"Hanumān, the son of Maruta spake with folded hands unto him, conversant"
13185,SECTION CXXVII.,"with piety like virtue incarnate, saying—""Kākutstha, living in the"
13186,SECTION CXXVII.,"forest of Dandaka with bark and matted hairs, for whom thou art"
13187,SECTION CXXVII.,"lamenting, hath enquired after thy welfare. Do thou, O worshipful sire,"
13188,SECTION CXXVII.,speak out thy welfare and renounce the dreadful grief. Thou shalt in
13189,SECTION CXXVII.,"this moment be reconciled to thy brother Rāma. Slaying Rāvana, and"
13190,SECTION CXXVII.,"regaining Maithili, Rāma, having accomplished his end, hath arrived here"
13191,SECTION CXXVII.,with his valiant friends. The highly effulgent Lakshmana and the famed
13192,SECTION CXXVII.,Vaidehi (have also come). Sitā fareth well with Rāma like unto Sachi in
13193,SECTION CXXVII.,"the company of Mahendra"". Being thus addressed by Hanumān, Bharata, the"
13194,SECTION CXXVII.,"son of Kaikeyi, delighted, fell down all on a sudden in a swoon of joy."
13195,SECTION CXXVII.,"Thereupon rising up in no time, and welcoming him, Bharata, the"
13196,SECTION CXXVII.,"descendant of Raghu, spake unto Hanumān communicating the pleasant"
13197,SECTION CXXVII.,"tidings, the following words. And embracing the monkey respectfully the"
13198,SECTION CXXVII.,graceful Bharata sprinkled him with profuse tears not out of grief but
13199,SECTION CXXVII.,"of joy. He said,—""Art thou a man or god who hast kindly come here? O"
13200,SECTION CXXVII.,"gentle one, I shall confer upon thee, who hast communicated unto me this"

13206,SECTION CXXVII.,"of Rāma, the son of the king, delighted became anxious to behold him and"
13207,SECTION CXXVII.,again addressed joyously Hanumān with the following words.
13208,SECTION CXXVII.,
13209,SECTION CXXVII.,⁴⁹¹ A low caste aboriginal Hindu corresponding to our _Chandālas_
13210,SECTION CXXVII.,always living in the forest. The Raja of Ramnud in the district of
13211,SECTION CXXVII.,Madurā in Madras traces his descent from this Guha.

13214,SECTION CXXVII.,exile he is living at the hermitage of Varadwāja. He shall leave
13215,SECTION CXXVII.,that place to-morrow.—T.

13222,SECTION CXXVIII.,
13223,SECTION CXXVIII.,
13224,SECTION CXXVIII.,"""I hear the tidings of my brother affording me great delight who hath"
13225,SECTION CXXVIII.,been living in the huge forest for many a year. The saying of the people
13226,SECTION CXXVIII.,"appeareth to me as instinct with well meaning that a man, if alive, may"
13227,SECTION CXXVIII.,"attain to joy even after a century. Do thou relate truly unto me, how"
13228,SECTION CXXVIII.,and in what country the union between Rāghava and the monkeys was
13229,SECTION CXXVIII.,"brought about"". Being thus accosted by the prince and seated on Kuça,"
13230,SECTION CXXVIII.,"he, thereupon, began to describe Rāma’s life in the forest. ""How Rāma"
13231,SECTION CXXVIII.,"was exiled, the two boons conferred upon thy mother, how king Daçaratha"
13232,SECTION CXXVIII.,"died in consequence of (his) son’s grief, how by emissaries, O lord,"
13233,SECTION CXXVIII.,"thou wert brought up from the house of thy maternal uncle, how thou"
13234,SECTION CXXVIII.,"didst not wish for the kingdom having entered Ayodhyā, how thy brother,"
13235,SECTION CXXVIII.,"the repressor of enemies, was solicited by thee for accepting the"
13236,SECTION CXXVIII.,"kingdom, reparing to the mount Chitrakuta, who hast ever wended the"
13237,SECTION CXXVIII.,"track of the pious, the renouncement of kingdom (by him) abiding by the"
13238,SECTION CXXVIII.,"words of the king, thy return after taking the sandals of thy revered"
13239,SECTION CXXVIII.,"(brother)—all these, O thou of long-arms, are known to thee. I shall"
13240,SECTION CXXVIII.,relate unto thee all that happened after thy return. Thyself having
13241,SECTION CXXVIII.,"returned thence, all the birds and animals were overwhelmed with terror"
13242,SECTION CXXVIII.,and that forest appeared as if distressed. Thereupon he entered the
13243,SECTION CXXVIII.,solitary and huge and dreadful forest Dandaka distressed by the
13244,SECTION CXXVIII.,"elephants and abounding in lions, tigers and deer. And they entering the"
13245,SECTION CXXVIII.,dense forest there appeared before them the powerful Birādha⁴⁹⁴ emitting
13246,SECTION CXXVIII.,a dreadful sound. And taking him up roaring aloud like an elephant Rāma
13247,SECTION CXXVIII.,threw him with his arms upwards and face downwards into a pit. Having
13248,SECTION CXXVIII.,"accomplished that difficult work the two brothers Rāma and Lakshmana,"
13249,SECTION CXXVIII.,arrived in the evening at the pleasant hermitage of _Sarabhanga_. And
13250,SECTION CXXVIII.,"_Sarabhanga_ having attained to heaven, Rāma, having truth for his"
13251,SECTION CXXVIII.,"prowess, saluting all the ascetics, repaired to Janasthāna. And by the"
13252,SECTION CXXVIII.,"high-souled Rāghava, living there, fourteen thousand inhabitants of"
13253,SECTION CXXVIII.,Janasthāna were slain. In the company of one person only and at the
13254,SECTION CXXVIII.,"commencement of the fight, by Rāma, within the one fourth part of a day,"
13255,SECTION CXXVIII.,were exterminated all the highly powerful and valiant inhabitants of the
13256,SECTION CXXVIII.,forest of Dandaka always putting obstructions in the way of the
13257,SECTION CXXVIII.,ascetics. All the Rākshasas were grinded (to death) by Rāghava. Khara
13258,SECTION CXXVIII.,was slain in the conflict; Dushana being slain first Trishirā was slain
13259,SECTION CXXVIII.,"thereafter by him. Thereafter (a she-demon) named Surpanakhā, came to"
13260,SECTION CXXVIII.,"the side of Rāma. Thereupon being commanded by Rāma, the highly powerful"
13261,SECTION CXXVIII.,Lakshmana rose up all on a sudden and taking a dagger chopped off her
13262,SECTION CXXVIII.,ears and nose. Being thus insulted by him that she-demon came to Rāvana.
13263,SECTION CXXVIII.,"Thereupon a dreadful Rākshasa named Māricha—an attendant of Rāvana,"
13264,SECTION CXXVIII.,"assuming the shape of a jewelled deer, allured Vaidehi. And beholding"
13265,SECTION CXXVIII.,"it, Vaidehi spake unto Rāma, saying,—’Do thou catch it; with it when"
13266,SECTION CXXVIII.,"caught our hermitage shall be more charming.’ Thereupon Rāma, with bow"
13267,SECTION CXXVIII.,"in his hand, pursued that deer and with one shaft destroyed it. O gentle"
13268,SECTION CXXVIII.,"one, Rāghava going out on hunting, and Lakshmana having issued out of"
13269,SECTION CXXVIII.,"the hermitage, the Ten-necked (demon) entered therein. And he speedily"
13270,SECTION CXXVIII.,"got hold of Sitā, like unto Rohini possessed by the planet in the sky."
13271,SECTION CXXVIII.,Thereupon slaying the vulture Yatāyu in the conflict desirous of
13272,SECTION CXXVIII.,rescuing her and getting hold of Sitā that Rākshasa speedily repaired
13273,SECTION CXXVIII.,"(to his capital). Thereupon some monkeys resembling mountains, stationed"
13274,SECTION CXXVIII.,"on the summit of a mountain, stricken with wondrous fear and"
13275,SECTION CXXVIII.,"astonishment, beheld Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas proceed with Sitā."
13276,SECTION CXXVIII.,"Ascending the car _Puskpaka_, going at will, with Vaidehi and hastening"
13277,SECTION CXXVIII.,"his course that highly powerful Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas entered"
13278,SECTION CXXVIII.,Lankā. And entering the huge and excellent golden palace Rāvana consoled
13279,SECTION CXXVIII.,Maithili with (diverse) words. But she regarded that foremost of
13280,SECTION CXXVIII.,Rākshasas and his words as straw. And Vaidehi was placed in the forest
13281,SECTION CXXVIII.,of Asoka. Thereupon returned Rāma after having slain the deer in the
13282,SECTION CXXVIII.,"forest. Having returned and seen the vulture, dearer than his father,"
13283,SECTION CXXVIII.,"slain, Rāma, the descendant of Kākutstha was pained. And searching"
13284,SECTION CXXVIII.,Vaidehi and ranging at the banks of Godāveri and forest-lands covered
13285,SECTION CXXVIII.,"with flowers, Rāma with Lakshmana, met in that huge forest a Rākshasa"
13286,SECTION CXXVIII.,"named Kavandha. Thereupon at the words of Kavandha, Rāma, having truth"
13287,SECTION CXXVIII.,"for his prowess, repairing to the mount Rishyamuka, was united with"
13288,SECTION CXXVIII.,Sugriva. There had grown mutual love in them before they were known to
13289,SECTION CXXVIII.,each other. Sugriva was driven away by his angry brother Vāli. And
13290,SECTION CXXVIII.,informed of each other’s affairs their friendship grew closer.
13291,SECTION CXXVIII.,There-upon slaying the huge-bodied and highly powerful Vāli in the
13292,SECTION CXXVIII.,conflict by virtue of the strength of his own arms Rāma obtained (for
13293,SECTION CXXVIII.,Sugriva) his own kingdom. And being placed on the throne with all the
13294,SECTION CXXVIII.,"monkeys, Sugriva promised unto Rāma the enquiry of the Princess (Sitā)."
13295,SECTION CXXVIII.,"Being commanded by the high-souled Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, ten"
13296,SECTION CXXVIII.,_kotis_ of monkeys repaired to (various) quarters. Among them some of us
13297,SECTION CXXVIII.,"lost our way in a cavity of the Vindhya mountain, and were striken with"
13298,SECTION CXXVIII.,great terror—and accordingly much time was lost. The powerful brother of
13299,SECTION CXXVIII.,the king of vultures named Sampāti communicated unto us the residence of
13300,SECTION CXXVIII.,Sitā in the palace of Rāvana. Thereupon removing the grief of my
13301,SECTION CXXVIII.,"relatives stricken with sorrow and resorting to my own prowess, I jumped"
13302,SECTION CXXVIII.,"over a hundred _yojanas_ and beheld her placed in the forest of Asoka,"
13303,SECTION CXXVIII.,"wearing a red cloth, pale, deprived of all joy and observing strict"
13304,SECTION CXXVIII.,penances. And then nearing her and beholding her of a perfectly
13305,SECTION CXXVIII.,blameless person I bestowed upon her an ensign a ring with Rāma’s name
13306,SECTION CXXVIII.,"engraven on it. And obtaining a jewel as an ensign, I, with my object"
13307,SECTION CXXVIII.,"accomplished, returned. And having returned I presented Rāma of"
13308,SECTION CXXVIII.,unwearied actions with that ensign of a brilliant gem. And hearing (of
13309,SECTION CXXVIII.,the news of Vaidehi) Rāma regained his life like one on the verge of
13310,SECTION CXXVIII.,death regaining his being after drinking nectar. And exciting (his
13311,SECTION CXXVIII.,soldiers) for making preparations like unto Fire about to destroy all
13312,SECTION CXXVIII.,people he made up his mind for the devastation of Lankā. Thereupon
13313,SECTION CXXVIII.,arriving at the banks of the ocean he had a bridge constructed by Nala
13314,SECTION CXXVIII.,by which the army of monkey-heroes crossed (the deep). Nala destroyed
13315,SECTION CXXVIII.,"Prahasta, Rāghava slew Kumbhakarna, Lakshmana killed the son of Rāvana"
13316,SECTION CXXVIII.,"and Rāma himself slew Rāvana. He was then met by Sakra, Yama, Varuna,"
13317,SECTION CXXVIII.,"Siva, Brahmā and Daçaratha. And that graceful descendant of Kākutstha,"
13318,SECTION CXXVIII.,"the slayer of foes, obtained the boon from them as well as from the"
13319,SECTION CXXVIII.,saints assembled there—(celestial and otherwise). Having obtained the
13320,SECTION CXXVIII.,"boon he, delighted, met the monkeys and in the car _Pushpaka_ reached"
13321,SECTION CXXVIII.,Kishkindhā. Again reaching the Ganges he is living with the ascetic; it
13322,SECTION CXXVIII.,becometh thee to behold him to-morrow under the auspices of of
13323,SECTION CXXVIII.,"Pushya,⁴⁹⁵ without any hindrance"". Thereupon being delighted with the"
13324,SECTION CXXVIII.,"sweet accents of Hanumān, Bharata addressed him, with folded hands, with"
13325,SECTION CXXVIII.,"words affording delight, saying,—""After a long time my desire hath been"
13326,SECTION CXXVIII.,"fulfilled""."
13327,SECTION CXXVIII.,
13328,SECTION CXXVIII.,⁴⁹⁴ A demon of that name.
13329,SECTION CXXVIII.,
13330,SECTION CXXVIII.,⁴⁹⁵ The lunar asterism comprising three stars of which one is the

13335,SECTION CXXIX.,SECTION CXXIX.
13336,SECTION CXXIX.,
13337,SECTION CXXIX.,
13338,SECTION CXXIX.,"Hearing those words affording great delight, Bharata, the slayer of"
13339,SECTION CXXIX.,"enemies, having truth for his prowess, delighted, ordered Satrughna,"
13340,SECTION CXXIX.,"(saying),—""Let all people being purified worship all the deities and"
13341,SECTION CXXIX.,altars of the city with fragrant garlands and diverse music. Let all the
13342,SECTION CXXIX.,"bards conversant with the chanting of the pedigree, the flatterers, all"
13343,SECTION CXXIX.,"those conversant with music, the dancing girls, the queens, the"
13344,SECTION CXXIX.,"courtiers, the soldiers with their wives, Brāhmanas, Kshatryas, and"
13345,SECTION CXXIX.,"people of all other castes, issue out to behold the moon-like"
13346,SECTION CXXIX.,"countenance of Rāma"". Hearing the words of Bharata, Satrughna, the"
13347,SECTION CXXIX.,"slayer of enemies, divided the work amongst the servants, (saying),—""Do"
13348,SECTION CXXIX.,ye level the high and low ground from Nandigrām to (Ayodhyā). Do ye
13349,SECTION CXXIX.,perfectly water the ground with cold water. Thereafter sprinkle all the
13350,SECTION CXXIX.,places with flowers and dried paddy; hoist up flags all over the city;
13351,SECTION CXXIX.,"decorate all the houses, before the rising of the moon with garlands,"
13352,SECTION CXXIX.,"jewels, flowers of gold and things of five other colours. Let hundreds"
13353,SECTION CXXIX.,"of men watch the thorough-fares"". Hearing the command of Satrughna,"
13354,SECTION CXXIX.,"issued out with delight Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddartha,"
13355,SECTION CXXIX.,"Arthasadhaka, Asoka, Mantrapāla and Sumantra. Thereupon issued out men"
13356,SECTION CXXIX.,on horse back and in cars with thousands of mad elephants well-decked
13357,SECTION CXXIX.,with pennons and she-elephants with golden seats (on their backs). And
13358,SECTION CXXIX.,some heroes proceeded encircled by a thousand excellent steeds and
13359,SECTION CXXIX.,"persons carrying _Sakti_, _Risthi_, maces and pennons and thousands of"
13360,SECTION CXXIX.,infantry. Thereupon proceeded Sumitrā and all other wives of Daçaratha
13361,SECTION CXXIX.,placing Kauçalya before them and seated in excellent conveyances. And
13362,SECTION CXXIX.,"hearing of the return of his brother and attaining to delight, the"
13363,SECTION CXXIX.,"high-souled and pious Bharata, reduced with fasting, poorly, wearing"
13364,SECTION CXXIX.,"bark and skin of an antelope and conversant with religion, issued out to"
13365,SECTION CXXIX.,receive back Rāma in the company of his counsellors and encircled by the
13366,SECTION CXXIX.,"twice-born ones, the people of diverse castes, his own relations and"
13367,SECTION CXXIX.,"kinsmen and ministers with garlands and _Modaka_⁴⁹⁶ in their hands,"
13368,SECTION CXXIX.,"eulogized by the bards, having his arrival announced with the sound of"
13369,SECTION CXXIX.,conchs and bugles and placing the sandals of his worshipful brother on
13370,SECTION CXXIX.,his head and taking white umbrella adorned with white garlands and white
13371,SECTION CXXIX.,_Chowries_ decked with gold and worthy of being used by the kings.
13372,SECTION CXXIX.,"Thereupon with the sound of the horses’ hoofs and cars, conchs and"
13373,SECTION CXXIX.,bugles the earth shook. And the whole city went to Nandigrām. And
13374,SECTION CXXIX.,"beholding the Wind-god’s son, Bharata said,—""Didst thou not resort to"
13375,SECTION CXXIX.,the usual fickleness of the monkeys? We do not behold the worshipful
13376,SECTION CXXIX.,"Rāma, the descendant of Kākutstha—the slayer of foes. Nor do we behold"
13377,SECTION CXXIX.,"the monkeys assuming shapes at will"". Having been addressed with those"
13378,SECTION CXXIX.,"words, Hanumān replied, communicating unto Bharata, having truth for his"
13379,SECTION CXXIX.,"prowess, the truth,—""Having reached the trees, covered by the favour of"
13380,SECTION CXXIX.,"Varadwaja, with fruits and flowers and pouring honey, the monkeys are"
13381,SECTION CXXIX.,"emitting noise like maddened black bees. O slayer of foes, this boon was"
13382,SECTION CXXIX.,granted him (Rāma) by Vāsava. (Varadwaya) is treating him with his army
13383,SECTION CXXIX.,with all hospitality. Hear the dreadful noise of the delighted monkeys.
13384,SECTION CXXIX.,Methinks the monkey host hath crossed the river Gomati. Behold the huge
13385,SECTION CXXIX.,upheaval of dust towards the _Sāla_ forest. Methinks the monkeys are
13386,SECTION CXXIX.,agitating the graceful _Sāla_ forest. Behold there at the distance the
13387,SECTION CXXIX.,"car resembling the Sun. This celestial car _Pashpaka_, constructed by"
13388,SECTION CXXIX.,"Brahmā’s mind, was obtained by the high-souled (Rāma) after having slain"
13389,SECTION CXXIX.,"Rāvana with his friends. This celestial car, resembling the newly risen"
13390,SECTION CXXIX.,"Sun, coursing at will and carrying Rāma (was gained) by the favour of"
13391,SECTION CXXIX.,the Giver of wealth. (There are) the two heroic brothers—the descendants
13392,SECTION CXXIX.,"of Raghu with Yaidehi, the highly effulgent Sugriva and the Rākshasa"
13393,SECTION CXXIX.,"Bibhishana. Thereupon with the sound of ""there is Rāma"" there arose a"
13394,SECTION CXXIX.,"joyous noise reaching the abode of the celestials from among women,"
13395,SECTION CXXIX.,"children, the young and the old. Thereupon descending upon the earth"
13396,SECTION CXXIX.,"from chariots, elephants and horses all people beheld him (Rāma)"
13397,SECTION CXXIX.,stationed on the car like unto the moon in the sky. And facing Rāghava
13398,SECTION CXXIX.,and with folded hands Bharata delightedly worshipped him with agreeable
13399,SECTION CXXIX.,"words, _Arghya_ and water to wash his feet. There appeared in the car"
13400,SECTION CXXIX.,constructed by Brahmā’s mind the elder brother of Bharata having
13401,SECTION CXXIX.,expansive eyes like the immortal wielder of thunder-bolt. Thereupon
13402,SECTION CXXIX.,Bharata humbly saluted his brother Rāma seated on the top of the car
13403,SECTION CXXIX.,like unto the Sun on the summit (of the mount Meru). And commanded by
13404,SECTION CXXIX.,Rāma that excellent car drawn by ganders got down on the earth with
13405,SECTION CXXIX.,"great velocity. And ascending that car, Bharata, having truth for his"
13406,SECTION CXXIX.,"prowess, reaching Rāma, delighted, again bowed unto him. And raising"
13407,SECTION CXXIX.,Bharata up who had been seen after a long time and placing him on his
13408,SECTION CXXIX.,"lap Kākutstha, delighted, embraced him. There-upon Bharata, the slayer"
13409,SECTION CXXIX.,"of foes, bowed unto Vaidehi and welcomed Lakshmana. And the son of"
13410,SECTION CXXIX.,"Kaikeyi (then in turn) embraced Sugriva, Jāmbavāna, Angada, Mainda,"
13411,SECTION CXXIX.,"Dwivida, Nila and Rishava. And he then embraced Sushena, Nala, Gabāksha,"
13412,SECTION CXXIX.,"Gandhamādana, Sarabha, and Panasa. And assuming human shapes, those"
13413,SECTION CXXIX.,"monkeys, assuming shapes at will, delightedly enquired after Bharata’s"
13414,SECTION CXXIX.,"well-being. And embracing Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, the highly"
13415,SECTION CXXIX.,"effulgent prince Bharata, the foremost of the pious, said—"" O Sugriva,"
13416,SECTION CXXIX.,thou art our fifth brother. From brotherliness groweth friendship and
13417,SECTION CXXIX.,"doing injury is the sign of an enemy"". And Bharata then addressed"
13418,SECTION CXXIX.,"Bibhishana with soothing words—""It is by fortune that through your help"
13419,SECTION CXXIX.,"he hath accomplished such a difficult work"". Thereupon the heroic"
13420,SECTION CXXIX.,"Satrughna saluting Rāma and Lakshmana, respectfully bowed unto Sitā. And"
13421,SECTION CXXIX.,"having approached his mother, pale and pulled down with grief, Rāma"
13422,SECTION CXXIX.,humbly touched her feet and enhanced her delight. And thereupon saluting
13423,SECTION CXXIX.,"Sumitrā, famed Kaikeyi and all his mothers he approached the priests."
13424,SECTION CXXIX.,Thereupon all the citizens with folded hands welcomed him
13425,SECTION CXXIX.,"saying—""Welcome art thou, O thou of long arms! O thou the enhancer of"
13426,SECTION CXXIX.,"Kauçalya’s joy!"" And the elder brother of Bharata observed the folded"
13427,SECTION CXXIX.,hands of the citizens like so many blown lotuses. And himself taking the
13428,SECTION CXXIX.,"sandals of Rāma, Bharata, conversant with piety, placed them at the feet"
13429,SECTION CXXIX.,of that lord of men. Thereupon Bharata with folded hands spoke unto
13430,SECTION CXXIX.,"Rāma, saying—""This all thy kingdom, which thou didst leave to my care, I"
13431,SECTION CXXIX.,"return thee. Blessed is my birth to-day and accomplished is my desire,"
13432,SECTION CXXIX.,since I behold thee again as king in Ayodhyā after thy return. Do thou
13433,SECTION CXXIX.,"examine thy wealth, treasury, palace and army. By thy favour I have"
13434,SECTION CXXIX.,"increased all these ten fold"". Hearing Bharata speak in that wise and"
13435,SECTION CXXIX.,beholding him devoted to his brother all the monkeys and the Rākshasa
13436,SECTION CXXIX.,"Bibhishana shed tears. Thereupon placing Bharata, in delight, on his"
13437,SECTION CXXIX.,"lap, Rāghava, with his army in that car, proceeded towards Bharata’s"
13438,SECTION CXXIX.,abode. And reaching Bharata’s palace Rāghava with his army descended
13439,SECTION CXXIX.,"upon the earth. Thereupon Rāma said to the excellent car—""Do thou (now)"
13440,SECTION CXXIX.,"go to _Vaisrāvana_—I do permit thee"". Thereupon being thus commanded by"
13441,SECTION CXXIX.,"Rāma, that excellent car, proceeding towards the north, reached the"
13442,SECTION CXXIX.,abode of the Giver of wealth. That celestial car _Pushpaka_ had been
13443,SECTION CXXIX.,taken away by the Rākshasa (Rāvana); but now at the words of Rāma it
13444,SECTION CXXIX.,reached (again) the Giver of wealth. And touching the feet of his priest
13445,SECTION CXXIX.,the powerful Rāghava sat on a separate and excellent seat like unto
13446,SECTION CXXIX.,"Sakra, the lord of immortals (by the side of) _Vrihashpati_."

13459,SECTION CXXX.,unto a young one unable to carry a heavy burden thrown off by a powerful
13460,SECTION CXXX.,bull I am unable to carry this huge burden (of the kingdom). I do
13461,SECTION CXXX.,"consider this kingdom infested with thieves, difficult to govern, as it"
13462,SECTION CXXX.,is difficult to re-construct a bridge broken down by a powerful current
13463,SECTION CXXX.,of water. As an ass cannot follow the course of a horse and a crow
13464,SECTION CXXX.,"cannot follow that of a gander, so I am unable, O hero, O slayer of"
13465,SECTION CXXX.,"foes, to follow thy footsteps. If a tree planted in the inner appartment"

13476,SECTION CXXX.,"enemies’ cities, saying,—""So be it"" sat on an excellent seat. Thereupon"
13477,SECTION CXXX.,"at the command of Satrughna, expert, skilful and quick-handed barbers"
13478,SECTION CXXX.,"gathered round Rāghava. At first, Bharata, the highly powerful"
13479,SECTION CXXX.,"Lakshmana, Sugriva the lord of monkeys, and Bibhishana the lord of"
13480,SECTION CXXX.,"Rākshasas bathed. Thereupon shorn of his matted hairs, bathed, with"
13481,SECTION CXXX.,"paste excellent garlands and precious clothes on, he appeared there"
13482,SECTION CXXX.,"shining in grace. The valiant and graceful Satrughna, the upholder of"
13483,SECTION CXXX.,"the dignity of Ikshwaku race, himself got ready the dresses for Rāma and"
13484,SECTION CXXX.,Lakshmana. And all the high-minded wives of Daçaratha with their own
13485,SECTION CXXX.,"hands decked Sitā with various charming (ornaments). Thereupon Kauçalyā,"
13486,SECTION CXXX.,"delighted and fond of her son, herself with great care, decorated the"
13487,SECTION CXXX.,"wives of monkeys. Thereupon at the words of Satrughna, the charioteer by"
13488,SECTION CXXX.,name Sumantra got ready the perfectly beautiful car. And beholding that
13489,SECTION CXXX.,"celestial car, bright as the fire of the sun, stationed before him,"
13490,SECTION CXXX.,"Rāma, having long arms, the conqueror of enemies’ cities, ascended it."
13491,SECTION CXXX.,"Sugriva and Hanumān, graceful like Mahendra, bathed, dressed in"
13492,SECTION CXXX.,"celestial clothes and wearing excellent _Kundalas_, proceeded (to view"
13493,SECTION CXXX.,the city). And then went Sitā and all the wives of Sugriva decorated
13494,SECTION CXXX.,"with all ornaments and wearing excellent _Kundalas_, anxious to behold"
13495,SECTION CXXX.,the city. All the ministers of king Daçaratha in Ayodhyā began to hold
13496,SECTION CXXX.,"consultation respectfully with the priest. Asoka, Vijaya and Siddhartha,"
13497,SECTION CXXX.,"with undivided mind, consulted with each other about the welfare of Rāma"
13498,SECTION CXXX.,as well as that of the city. (Thereupon they ordered the servants)
13499,SECTION CXXX.,"saying,—""Do ye collect materials necessary for the auspicious"
13500,SECTION CXXX.,installation of the high-souled (Rāma) worthy of being crowned with
13501,SECTION CXXX.,"victory"". The priest and the ministers having ordered thus all speedily"
13502,SECTION CXXX.,issued out of the city to behold Rāma. Like unto the thousand-eyed Indra
13503,SECTION CXXX.,"in his car drawn by horses the blameless Rāma, seated in his car,"
13504,SECTION CXXX.,"proceeded towards the excellent city. Bharata took up the reins,"
13505,SECTION CXXX.,Satrughna held the umbrella and Lakshmana began to fan him on the head
13506,SECTION CXXX.,"with _Chowries_. And Bibhishana, the lord of Rākshasas standing on one"
13507,SECTION CXXX.,"side, took up the white _Chowrie_ shining like the second moon. There"
13508,SECTION CXXX.,was audible the sweet encomium of Rāma chanted by the crowd of ascetics
13509,SECTION CXXX.,"in the sky, the celestials and the Marutas. Thereupon the highly"
13510,SECTION CXXX.,"effulgent Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, got up upon an elephant"
13511,SECTION CXXX.,named _Satrunyaya_ resembling a mountain. And riding nine thousand
13512,SECTION CXXX.,elephants proceeded the monkeys assuming human shapes and adorned with
13513,SECTION CXXX.,various ornaments. And with the music of conches and bugles that
13514,SECTION CXXX.,foremost of men entered the city abounding in houses. (And the citizens)
13515,SECTION CXXX.,beheld Rāghava enter the city with a graceful person and seated in the
13516,SECTION CXXX.,car. And they having bowed unto that descendant of Kākutstha were
13517,SECTION CXXX.,welcomed by him. And they followed that high-souled one encircled by his
13518,SECTION CXXX.,"brothers. And surrounded by his courtiers, Brāhmanas and subjects Rāma"
13519,SECTION CXXX.,appeared beautiful like unto the Moon encircled by stars. And he went
13520,SECTION CXXX.,"proceeded by men who play on stringed instruments, by people with"
13521,SECTION CXXX.,_Karatal_ and Sustika in their hands and by men chanting delightedly
13522,SECTION CXXX.,"auspicious songs. Persons with Akshata and gold in their hands, kine,"
13523,SECTION CXXX.,"girls, Brāhmanas and persons with _Modaka_ in their hands went before"
13524,SECTION CXXX.,Rāma. Thereupon before the ministers Rāma began to describe the
13525,SECTION CXXX.,"friendship of Sugriva, the prowess of the Wind-god’s son and the works"
13526,SECTION CXXX.,accomplished by the monkeys. And hearing of the works of the monkeys and
13527,SECTION CXXX.,"the prowess of the Rākshasas, the inhabitants of the city of Ayodhyā"
13528,SECTION CXXX.,attained to astonishment. Having related thus (the works of the monkeys)
13529,SECTION CXXX.,the graceful Rāma encircled by the monkeys entered (the city of) Ayodhyā
13530,SECTION CXXX.,abounding in delighted and plump persons. Thereupon the citizens hoisted
13531,SECTION CXXX.,up flags upon every house and he reached the picturesque abode of his
13532,SECTION CXXX.,ancestors inhabited by the descendants of Ikshwaku. And having reached
13533,SECTION CXXX.,"and entered his ancestral palace and bowed unto Kauçalyā, Sumitrā and"
13534,SECTION CXXX.,"Kaikeyi, the high-souled prince, the enhancer of the joy of the"
13535,SECTION CXXX.,"descendants of Raghu, addressed Bharata the foremost of the pious, with"
13536,SECTION CXXX.,"sweet words instinct with meaning, saying,—""Do thou set apart for"
13537,SECTION CXXX.,Sugriva my huge and excellent palace abounding in pearls and
13538,SECTION CXXX.,"_Vaidurjas_"". Hearing those words, Bharata, having truth for his"
13539,SECTION CXXX.,"prowess, taking Sugriva by the hand, conducted him to the palace. And"
13540,SECTION CXXX.,"commanded by Satrughna, (servants) speedily entered (that palace) with"
13541,SECTION CXXX.,"oil, lamps, bedsteads and beddings. Thereupon the highly effulgent"
13542,SECTION CXXX.,"younger brother of Rāghava spoke unto Sugriva, saying,—""Do thou, O lord,"
13543,SECTION CXXX.,"order some (to bring water) for Rāma’s installation"". And Sugriva"
13544,SECTION CXXX.,conferred upon four leading monkeys four golden jars crested with
13545,SECTION CXXX.,"diverse jewels and said to them,—""Do ye so conduct, O monkeys, that ye"
13546,SECTION CXXX.,may return by the dawn with the jars filled with the water of the four
13547,SECTION CXXX.,"oceans"". Being thus addressed by the high-souled (Sugriva) the monkeys"
13548,SECTION CXXX.,resembling the elephants speedily rose up in the welkin like unto
13549,SECTION CXXX.,"quick-coursing vultures. Jāmbavāna, Hanumān, the monkey Vegadarshi and"
13550,SECTION CXXX.,Rishabha brought the jars filled with water from five hundred rivers.
13551,SECTION CXXX.,"Sushena, gifted with prowess, brought that jar crested with gems, filled"
13552,SECTION CXXX.,with water from the Eastern Ocean. And Rishabha speedily brought water
13553,SECTION CXXX.,"from the Southern Ocean. And Gabaya brought, from the great Western"
13554,SECTION CXXX.,"Ocean in that golden jar, water perfumed with the fragrance of red"
13555,SECTION CXXX.,"sandal and camphor. And the virtuous-souled Wind-god’s son, gifted with"
13556,SECTION CXXX.,"all accomplishments and the prowess of Gāruda and Wind-god, brought,"
13557,SECTION CXXX.,"speedily from the Northern Ocean, water in that jewelled jar. And"
13558,SECTION CXXX.,beholding water thus brought by the leading monkeys for the installation
13559,SECTION CXXX.,"of Rāma, Satrughna, with his ministers, communicated that unto the"
13560,SECTION CXXX.,"leading priests and friends. Thereupon the self-controlled Vasishtha,"
13561,SECTION CXXX.,"striken in years, along with other Brahmanas placed Rāma with Sitā on a"
13562,SECTION CXXX.,"jewelled seat. Vasishtha, Vijayā, Jāvāli, Kātyāyana, Goutama and"
13563,SECTION CXXX.,"Bāmadeva, sprinkled that foremost of men, with clear and fragrant water"
13564,SECTION CXXX.,as Vasus did the thousand eyed Vāsava. (He was then sprinkled by) the
13565,SECTION CXXX.,"_Rittigas_, Brāhmanas, maidens ministers, soldiers and the merchants all"
13566,SECTION CXXX.,delighted. (There-upon) with the juice of _Oshadhis_⁴⁹⁷ (he was
13567,SECTION CXXX.,"sprinkled by) the celestials stationed in the sky, the deities presiding"
13568,SECTION CXXX.,over the four quarters and all other celestials collected. And having
13569,SECTION CXXX.,placed him on a seat crested with various jewels in the arena decorated
13570,SECTION CXXX.,"with gold, various jewels and rich parapharnalia, (he placed on his"
13571,SECTION CXXX.,"head) the jewelled crown made by Brahmā, brilliant and with which in the"
13572,SECTION CXXX.,"days of yore Manu and other kings, born in his race, were installed. And"
13573,SECTION CXXX.,"being decked by the high-souled Vasishtha with that crown, Rāghava was"
13574,SECTION CXXX.,afterwards dressed with the celestial garments by the _Rittigas_.⁴⁹⁸ And
13575,SECTION CXXX.,Satrughna held the white and excellent umbrella and Sugriva the lord of
13576,SECTION CXXX.,monkeys took the white _Chowrie_. And Bibhishana the lord of Rākshasas
13577,SECTION CXXX.,took up another _Chowrie_ resembling the moon. And the wind commanded by
13578,SECTION CXXX.,"Vāsava conferred upon Rāghava, a garland of a hundred golden lotuses,"
13579,SECTION CXXX.,shining in their native lustre. And the wind commanded by Sakra
13580,SECTION CXXX.,conferred upon that lord of men a jewelled garland crested with diverse
13581,SECTION CXXX.,gems. The intelligent and worthy Rāma being installed the celestials and

13583,SECTION CXXX.,"crops, the trees with fruits and the flowers were fragrant on the"
13584,SECTION CXXX.,occassion of Rāghava’s installation. And that foremost of men conferred
13585,SECTION CXXX.,"upon the twice-born ones one million of horses, a hundred thousand cows"
13586,SECTION CXXX.,and a hundred thousand bulls. And Rāghava again conferred upon the

13591,SECTION CXXX.,"Angada, Vāli’s son, two _Angadas_⁴⁹⁹ brilliant as the rays of the moon"
13592,SECTION CXXX.,and made of _Baidurja_. And Rāma conferred upon Sitā an excellent pearl
13593,SECTION CXXX.,"necklace crested with precious jems, celestial clothes and various"
13594,SECTION CXXX.,excellent ornaments. And taking off the necklace from her person
13595,SECTION CXXX.,"Vaidehi, the daughter of king Janaka, conferred it upon the Wind-god’s"
13596,SECTION CXXX.,son remembering the services (rendered by him) and cast her looks again
13597,SECTION CXXX.,and again upon her lord and the monkeys. And beholding that (Rāma)
13598,SECTION CXXX.,"capable of reading the gestures, spoke unto the daughter of king Janaka,"
13599,SECTION CXXX.,"saying—""O fortunate and beautiful lady, do thou confer this necklace"
13600,SECTION CXXX.,"upon him with whom thou art pleased"". Thereupon the lotus-eyed (Sitā)"
13601,SECTION CXXX.,"conferred that upon the Wind god’s son. And Hanumān, the foremost of"
13602,SECTION CXXX.,"monkeys, in whom perpetually exist, energy, forgiveness, fame,"

13610,SECTION CXXX.,"Thereupon, the lord of earth and the slayer of foes conferred, all"

13622,SECTION CXXX.,unto our ancestors do thou now carry the burden of an associate in the
13623,SECTION CXXX.,"throne"". When the son of Sumitrā did not accept the heir apparentship"
13624,SECTION CXXX.,"albeit solicited earnestly again and again, the high-souled (Rāma)"
13625,SECTION CXXX.,conferred upon Bharata that dignity. And that son of king performed
