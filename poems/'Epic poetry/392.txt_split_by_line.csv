47,THE ARGUMENT.,THE ARGUMENT.
48,THE ARGUMENT.,"God sends his angel to Tortosa down,"
49,THE ARGUMENT.,Godfrey unites the Christian Peers and Knights;
50,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the Lords and Princes of renown
51,THE ARGUMENT.,"Choose him their Duke, to rule the wares and fights."
52,THE ARGUMENT.,"He mustereth all his host, whose number known,"
53,THE ARGUMENT.,He sends them to the fort that Sion hights;
54,THE ARGUMENT.,"The aged tyrant Juda’s land that guides,"
55,THE ARGUMENT.,"In fear and trouble, to resist provides."
56,THE ARGUMENT.,
57,I,I
58,I,"The sacred armies, and the godly knight,"
59,I,"That the great sepulchre of Christ did free,"
60,I,"I sing; much wrought his valor and foresight,"
61,I,And in that glorious war much suffered he;
62,I,"In vain ’gainst him did Hell oppose her might,"
63,I,In vain the Turks and Morians armed be:
64,I,"His soldiers wild, to brawls and mutinies prest,"
65,I,"Reduced he to peace, so Heaven him blest."
66,I,
67,II,II
68,II,"O heavenly Muse, that not with fading bays"
69,II,"Deckest thy brow by the Heliconian spring,"
70,II,But sittest crowned with stars’ immortal rays
71,II,"In Heaven, where legions of bright angels sing;"
72,II,"Inspire life in my wit, my thoughts upraise,"
73,II,"My verse ennoble, and forgive the thing,"
74,II,"If fictions light I mix with truth divine,"
75,II,And fill these lines with other praise than thine.
76,II,
77,III,III
78,III,Thither thou know’st the world is best inclined
79,III,"Where luring Parnass most his sweet imparts,"
80,III,And truth conveyed in verse of gentle kind
81,III,To read perhaps will move the dullest hearts:
82,III,"So we, if children young diseased we find,"
83,III,Anoint with sweets the vessel’s foremost parts
84,III,To make them taste the potions sharp we give;
85,III,"They drink deceived, and so deceived, they live."
86,III,
87,IV,IV
88,IV,"Ye noble Princes, that protect and save"
89,IV,"The Pilgrim Muses, and their ship defend"
90,IV,"From rock of Ignorance and Error’s wave,"
91,IV,Your gracious eyes upon this labor bend:
92,IV,To you these tales of love and conquest brave
93,IV,"I dedicate, to you this work I send:"
94,IV,My Muse hereafter shall perhaps unfold
95,IV,"Your fights, your battles, and your combats bold."
96,IV,
97,V,V
98,V,For if the Christian Princes ever strive
99,V,"To win fair Greece out of the tyrants’ hands,"
100,V,And those usurping Ismaelites deprive
101,V,"Of woful Thrace, which now captived stands,"
102,V,"You must from realms and seas the Turks forth drive,"
103,V,"As Godfrey chased them from Juda’s lands,"
104,V,"And in this legend, all that glorious deed,"
105,V,"Read, whilst you arm you; arm you, whilst you read."
106,V,
107,VI,VI
108,VI,Six years were run since first in martial guise
109,VI,The Christian Lords warraid the eastern land;
110,VI,"Nice by assault, and Antioch by surprise,"
111,VI,"Both fair, both rich, both won, both conquered stand,"
112,VI,And this defended they in noblest wise
113,VI,’Gainst Persian knights and many a valiant band;
114,VI,"Tortosa won, lest winter might them shend,"
115,VI,"They drew to holds, and coming spring attend."
116,VI,
117,VII,VII
118,VII,"The sullen season now was come and gone,"
119,VII,"That forced them late cease from their noble war,"
120,VII,"When God Almighty form his lofty throne,"
121,VII,Set in those parts of Heaven that purest are
122,VII,"(As far above the clear stars every one,"
123,VII,"As it is hence up to the highest star),"
124,VII,"Looked down, and all at once this world beheld,"
125,VII,"Each land, each city, country, town and field."
126,VII,
127,VIII,VIII
128,VIII,"All things he viewed, at last in Syria stayed"
129,VIII,"Upon the Christian Lords his gracious eye,"
130,VIII,That wondrous look wherewith he oft surveyed
131,VIII,Men’s secret thoughts that most concealed lie
132,VIII,"He cast on puissant Godfrey, that assayed"
133,VIII,"To drive the Turks from Sion’s bulwarks high,"
134,VIII,"And, full of zeal and faith, esteemed light"
135,VIII,"All worldly honor, empire, treasure, might:"
136,VIII,
137,IX,IX
138,IX,"In Baldwin next he spied another thought,"
139,IX,Whom spirits proud to vain ambition move:
140,IX,"Tancred he saw his life’s joy set at naught,"
141,IX,So woe-begone was he with pains of love:
142,IX,"Boemond the conquered folk of Antioch brought,"
143,IX,The gentle yoke of Christian rule to prove:
144,IX,"He taught them laws, statutes and customs new,"
145,IX,"Arts, crafts, obedience, and religion true;"
146,IX,
147,X,X
148,X,"And with such care his busy work he plied,"
149,X,That to naught else his acting thoughts he bent:
150,X,"In young Rinaldo fierce desires he spied,"
151,X,And noble heart of rest impatient;
152,X,To wealth or sovereign power he naught applied
153,X,"His wits, but all to virtue excellent;"
154,X,"Patterns and rules of skill, and courage bold,"
155,X,"He took from Guelpho, and his fathers old."
156,X,
157,XI,XI
158,XI,"Thus when the Lord discovered had, and seen"
159,XI,"The hidden secrets of each worthy’s breast,"
160,XI,Out of the hierarchies of angels sheen
161,XI,"The gentle Gabriel called he from the rest,"
162,XI,’Twixt God and souls of men that righteous been
163,XI,"Ambassador is he, forever blest,"
164,XI,"The just commands of Heaven’s Eternal King,"
165,XI,"’Twixt skies and earth, he up and down doth bring."
166,XI,
167,XII,XII
168,XII,"To whom the Lord thus spake: “Godfredo find,"
169,XII,"And in my name ask him, why doth he rest?"
170,XII,Why be his arms to ease and peace resigned?
171,XII,Why frees he not Jerusalem distrest?
172,XII,"His peers to counsel call, each baser mind"
173,XII,"Let him stir up; for, chieftain of the rest"
174,XII,"I choose him here, the earth shall him allow,"
175,XII,His fellows late shall be his subjects now.”
176,XII,
177,XIII,XIII
178,XIII,"This said, the angel swift himself prepared"
179,XIII,"To execute the charge imposed aright,"
180,XIII,"In form of airy members fair imbared,"
181,XIII,"His spirits pure were subject to our sight,"
182,XIII,"Like to a man in show and shape he fared,"
183,XIII,"But full of heavenly majesty and might,"
184,XIII,"A stripling seemed he thrive five winters old,"
185,XIII,And radiant beams adorned his locks of gold.
186,XIII,
187,XIV,XIV
188,XIV,"Of silver wings he took a shining pair,"
189,XIV,"Fringed with gold, unwearied, nimble, swift;"
190,XIV,"With these he parts the winds, the clouds, the air,"
191,XIV,"And over seas and earth himself doth lift,"
192,XIV,"Thus clad he cut the spheres and circles fair,"
193,XIV,And the pure skies with sacred feathers clift;
194,XIV,"On Libanon at first his foot he set,"
195,XIV,And shook his wings with rory May dews wet.
196,XIV,
197,XV,XV
198,XV,Then to Tortosa’s confines swiftly sped
199,XV,"The sacred messenger, with headlong flight;"
200,XV,Above the eastern wave appeared red
201,XV,"The rising sun, yet scantly half in sight;"
202,XV,"Godfrey e’en then his morn-devotions said,"
203,XV,"As was his custom, when with Titan bright"
204,XV,"Appeared the angel in his shape divine,"
205,XV,Whose glory far obscured Phoebus’ shine.
206,XV,
207,XVI,XVI
208,XVI,"“Godfrey,” quoth he, “behold the season fit"
209,XVI,"To war, for which thou waited hast so long,"
210,XVI,"Now serves the time, if thou o’erslip not it,"
211,XVI,To free Jerusalem from thrall and wrong:
212,XVI,Thou with thy Lords in council quickly sit;
213,XVI,"Comfort the feeble, and confirm the strong,"
214,XVI,"The Lord of Hosts their general doth make thee,"
215,XVI,And for their chieftain they shall gladly take thee.
216,XVI,
217,XVII,XVII
218,XVII,"“I, messenger from everlasting Jove,"
219,XVII,In his great name thus his behests do tell;
220,XVII,"Oh, what sure hope of conquest ought thee move,"
221,XVII,"What zeal, what love should in thy bosom dwell!”"
222,XVII,"This said, he vanished to those seats above,"
223,XVII,"In height and clearness which the rest excel,"
224,XVII,"Down fell the Duke, his joints dissolved asunder,"
225,XVII,"Blind with the light, and strucken dead with wonder."
226,XVII,
227,XVIII,XVIII
228,XVIII,"But when recovered, he considered more,"
229,XVIII,"The man, his manner, and his message said;"
230,XVIII,"If erst he wished, now he longed sore"
231,XVIII,"To end that war, whereof he Lord was made;"
232,XVIII,"Nor swelled his breast with uncouth pride therefore,"
233,XVIII,"That Heaven on him above this charge had laid,"
234,XVIII,"But, for his great Creator would the same,"
235,XVIII,His will increased: so fire augmenteth flame.
236,XVIII,
237,XIX,XIX
238,XIX,"The captains called forthwith from every tent,"
239,XIX,Unto the rendezvous he them invites;
240,XIX,"Letter on letter, post on post he sent,"
241,XIX,"Entreatance fair with counsel he unites,"
242,XIX,"All, what a noble courage could augment,"
243,XIX,"The sleeping spark of valor what incites,"
244,XIX,"He used, that all their thoughts to honor raised,"
245,XIX,"Some praised, some paid, some counselled, all pleased."
246,XIX,
247,XX,XX
248,XX,"The captains, soldiers, all, save Boemond, came,"
249,XX,"And pitched their tents, some in the fields without,"
250,XX,"Some of green boughs their slender cabins frame,"
251,XX,"Some lodged were Tortosa’s streets about,"
252,XX,Of all the host the chief of worth and name
253,XX,"Assembled been, a senate grave and stout;"
254,XX,"Then Godfrey, after silence kept a space,"
255,XX,"Lift up his voice, and spake with princely grace:"
256,XX,
257,XXI,XXI
258,XXI,"“Warriors, whom God himself elected hath"
259,XXI,"His worship true in Sion to restore,"
260,XXI,"And still preserved from danger, harm and scath,"
261,XXI,"By many a sea and many an unknown shore,"
262,XXI,You have subjected lately to his faith
263,XXI,Some provinces rebellious long before:
264,XXI,"And after conquests great, have in the same"
265,XXI,Erected trophies to his cross and name.
266,XXI,
267,XXII,XXII
268,XXII,"“But not for this our homes we first forsook,"
269,XXII,And from our native soil have marched so far:
270,XXII,"Nor us to dangerous seas have we betook,"
271,XXII,"Exposed to hazard of so far sought war,"
272,XXII,"Of glory vain to gain an idle smook,"
273,XXII,And lands possess that wild and barbarous are:
274,XXII,"That for our conquests were too mean a prey,"
275,XXII,"To shed our bloods, to work our souls’ decay."
276,XXII,
277,XXIII,XXIII
278,XXIII,"“But this the scope was of our former thought,—"
279,XXIII,"Of Sion’s fort to scale the noble wall,"
280,XXIII,"The Christian folk from bondage to have brought,"
281,XXIII,"Wherein, alas, they long have lived thrall,"
282,XXIII,"In Palestine an empire to have wrought,"
283,XXIII,"Where godliness might reign perpetual,"
284,XXIII,"And none be left, that pilgrims might denay"
285,XXIII,"To see Christ’s tomb, and promised vows to pay."
286,XXIII,
287,XXIV,XXIV
288,XXIV,“What to this hour successively is done
289,XXIV,"Was full of peril, to our honor small,"
290,XXIV,"Naught to our first designment, if we shun"
291,XXIV,"The purposed end, or here lie fixed all."
292,XXIV,"What boots it us there wares to have begun,"
293,XXIV,"Or Europe raised to make proud Asia thrall,"
294,XXIV,"If our beginnings have this ending known,"
295,XXIV,"Not kingdoms raised, but armies overthrown?"
296,XXIV,
297,XXV,XXV
298,XXV,“Not as we list erect we empires new
299,XXV,"On frail foundations laid in earthly mould,"
300,XXV,Where of our faith and country be but few
301,XXV,"Among the thousands stout of Pagans bold,"
302,XXV,"Where naught behoves us trust to Greece untrue,"
303,XXV,And Western aid we far removed behold:
304,XXV,"Who buildeth thus, methinks, so buildeth he,"
305,XXV,As if his work should his sepulchre be.
306,XXV,
307,XXVI,XXVI
308,XXVI,"“Turks, Persians conquered, Antiochia won,"
309,XXVI,"Be glorious acts, and full of glorious praise,"
310,XXVI,"By Heaven’s mere grace, not by our prowess done:"
311,XXVI,"Those conquests were achieved by wondrous ways,"
312,XXVI,If now from that directed course we run
313,XXVI,"The God of Battles thus before us lays,"
314,XXVI,"His loving kindness shall we lose, I doubt,"
315,XXVI,And be a byword to the lands about.
316,XXVI,
317,XXVII,XXVII
318,XXVII,“Let not these blessings then sent from above
319,XXVII,"Abused be, or split in profane wise,"
320,XXVII,But let the issue correspondent prove
321,XXVII,To good beginnings of each enterprise;
322,XXVII,"The gentle season might our courage move,"
323,XXVII,Now every passage plain and open lies:
324,XXVII,What lets us then the great Jerusalem
325,XXVII,With valiant squadrons round about to hem?
326,XXVII,
327,XXVIII,XXVIII
328,XXVIII,"“Lords, I protest, and hearken all to it,"
329,XXVIII,"Ye times and ages, future, present, past,"
330,XXVIII,"Hear all ye blessed in the heavens that sit,"
331,XXVIII,The time for this achievement hasteneth fast:
332,XXVIII,"The longer rest worse will the season fit,"
333,XXVIII,Our sureties shall with doubt be overcast.
334,XXVIII,If we forslow the siege I well foresee
335,XXVIII,From Egypt will the Pagans succored be.”
336,XXVIII,
337,XXIX,XXIX
338,XXIX,"This said, the hermit Peter rose and spake,"
339,XXIX,Who sate in counsel those great Lords among:
340,XXIX,"“At my request this war was undertake,"
341,XXIX,"In private cell, who erst lived closed long,"
342,XXIX,"What Godfrey wills, of that no question make,"
343,XXIX,"There cast no doubts where truth is plain and strong,"
344,XXIX,"Your acts, I trust, will correspond his speech,"
345,XXIX,Yet one thing more I would you gladly teach.
346,XXIX,
347,XXX,XXX
348,XXX,"“These strifes, unless I far mistake the thing,"
349,XXX,"And discords raised oft in disordered sort,"
350,XXX,Your disobedience and ill managing
351,XXX,"Of actions lost, for want of due support,"
352,XXX,"Refer I justly to a further spring,"
353,XXX,"Spring of sedition, strife, oppression, tort,"
354,XXX,"I mean commanding power to sundry given,"
355,XXX,"In thought, opinion, worth, estate, uneven."
356,XXX,
357,XXXI,XXXI
358,XXXI,"“Where divers Lords divided empire hold,"
359,XXXI,"Where causes be by gifts, not justice tried,"
360,XXXI,"Where offices be falsely bought and sold,"
361,XXXI,Needs must the lordship there from virtue slide.
362,XXXI,"Of friendly parts one body then uphold,"
363,XXXI,"Create one head, the rest to rule and guide:"
364,XXXI,"To one the regal power and sceptre give,"
365,XXXI,That henceforth may your King and Sovereign live.”
366,XXXI,
367,XXXII,XXXII
368,XXXII,"And therewith stayed his speech.  O gracious Muse,"
369,XXXII,What kindling motions in their breasts do fry?
370,XXXII,"With grace divine the hermit’s talk infuse,"
371,XXXII,That in their hearts his words may fructify;
372,XXXII,"By this a virtuous concord they did choose,"
373,XXXII,And all contentions then began to die;
374,XXXII,"The Princes with the multitude agree,"
375,XXXII,That Godfrey ruler of those wars should be.
376,XXXII,
377,XXXIII,XXXIII
378,XXXIII,"This power they gave him, by his princely right,"
379,XXXIII,"All to command, to judge all, good and ill,"
380,XXXIII,"Laws to impose to lands subdued by might,"
381,XXXIII,"To maken war both when and where he will,"
382,XXXIII,"To hold in due subjection every wight,"
383,XXXIII,Their valors to be guided by his skill;
384,XXXIII,"This done, Report displays her tell-tale wings,"
385,XXXIII,And to each ear the news and tidings brings.
386,XXXIII,
387,XXXIV,XXXIV
388,XXXIV,"She told the soldiers, who allowed him meet"
389,XXXIV,And well deserving of that sovereign place.
390,XXXIV,Their first salutes and acclamations sweet
391,XXXIV,"Received he, with love and gentle grace;"
392,XXXIV,After their reverence done with kind regreet
393,XXXIV,"Requited was, with mild and cheerful face,"
394,XXXIV,He bids his armies should the following day
395,XXXIV,On those fair plains their standards proud display.
396,XXXIV,
397,XXXV,XXXV
398,XXXV,"The golden sun rose from the silver wave,"
399,XXXV,"And with his beams enamelled every green,"
400,XXXV,"When  up arose each warrior bold and brave,"
401,XXXV,"Glistering in filed steel and armor sheen,"
402,XXXV,"With jolly plumes their crests adorned they have,"
403,XXXV,And all tofore their chieftain mustered been:
404,XXXV,He from a mountain cast his curious sight
405,XXXV,On every footman and on every knight.
406,XXXV,
407,XXXVI,XXXVI
408,XXXVI,"My mind, Time’s enemy, Oblivion’s foe,"
409,XXXVI,"Disposer true of each noteworthy thing,"
410,XXXVI,"Oh, let thy virtuous might avail me so,"
411,XXXVI,"That I each troop and captain great may sing,"
412,XXXVI,"That in this glorious war did famous grow,"
413,XXXVI,Forgot till now by Time’s evil handling:
414,XXXVI,"This work, derived from my treasures dear,"
415,XXXVI,"Let all times hearken, never age outwear."
416,XXXVI,
417,XXXVII,XXXVII
418,XXXVII,"The French came foremost battailous and bold,"
419,XXXVII,"Late led by Hugo, brother to their King,"
420,XXXVII,From France the isle that rivers four infold
421,XXXVII,"With rolling streams descending from their spring,"
422,XXXVII,"But Hugo dead, the lily fair of gold,"
423,XXXVII,"Their wonted ensign they tofore them bring,"
424,XXXVII,"Under Clotharius great, a captain good,"
425,XXXVII,And hardy knight ysprong of princes’ blood.
426,XXXVII,
427,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
428,XXXVIII,"A thousand were they in strong armors clad,"
429,XXXVIII,"Next whom there marched forth another band,"
430,XXXVIII,"That number, nature, and instruction had,"
431,XXXVIII,"Like them to fight far off or charge at hand,"
432,XXXVIII,"All valiant Normans by Lord Robert lad,"
433,XXXVIII,"The native Duke of that renowned land,"
434,XXXVIII,"Two bishops next their standards proud upbare,"
435,XXXVIII,"Called Reverend William, and Good Ademare."
436,XXXVIII,
437,XXXIX,XXXIX
438,XXXIX,Their jolly notes they chanted loud and clear
439,XXXIX,"On merry mornings at the mass divine,"
440,XXXIX,And horrid helms high on their heads they bear
441,XXXIX,When their fierce courage they to war incline:
442,XXXIX,The first four hundred horsemen gathered near
443,XXXIX,"To Orange town, and lands that it confine:"
444,XXXIX,"But Ademare the Poggian youth brought out,"
445,XXXIX,"In number like, in hard assays as stout."

448,XL,"Baldwin, his ensign fair, did next dispread"
449,XL,"Among his Bulloigners of noble fame,"
450,XL,"His brother gave him all his troops to lead,"
451,XL,When he commander of the field became;
452,XL,"The Count Carinto did him straight succeed,"
453,XL,"Grave in advice, well skilled in Mars his game,"
454,XL,"Four hundred brought he, but so many thrice"

471,XLII,"He brought, that death or danger feared not:"
472,XLII,"It was their wont in feasts to spend the night,"
473,XLII,And pass cold days in baths and houses hot.

3489,LXXVI,O wondrous love!  thou makest gain of all;
3490,LXXVI,"For if she weeping sit, or smiling stand,"
3491,LXXVI,"She bends thy bow, or kindleth else thy brand."
3492,LXXVI,
3493,LXXVII,LXXVII
3494,LXXVII,This forged plaint drew forth unfeigned tears
3495,LXXVII,"From many eyes, and pierced each worthy’s heart;"
3496,LXXVII,"Each one condoleth with her that her hears,"
3497,LXXVII,And of her grief would help her bear the smart:
3498,LXXVII,"If Godfrey aid her not, not one but swears"
3499,LXXVII,Some tigress gave him suck on roughest part
3500,LXXVII,"Midst the rude crags, on Alpine cliffs aloft:"
3501,LXXVII,Hard is that heart which beauty makes not soft.
3502,LXXVII,

3504,LXXVIII,"But jolly Eustace, in whose breast the brand"
3505,LXXVIII,"Of love and pity kindled had the flame,"
3506,LXXVIII,"While others softly whispered underhand,"
3507,LXXVIII,Before the duke with comely boldness came:
3508,LXXVIII,"“Brother and lord,” quoth he, “too long you stand"
3509,LXXVIII,"In your first purpose, yet vouchsafe to frame"
3510,LXXVIII,"Your thoughts to ours, and lend this virgin aid:"
3511,LXXVIII,Thanks are half lost when good turns are delayed.
3512,LXXVIII,
3513,LXXIX,LXXIX
3514,LXXIX,“And think not that Eustace’s talk assays
3515,LXXIX,"To turn these forces from this present war,"
3516,LXXIX,Or that I wish you should your armies raise
3517,LXXIX,"From Sion’s walls, my speech tends not so far:"
3518,LXXIX,"But we that venture all for fame and praise,"
3519,LXXIX,"That to no charge nor service bounden are,"
3520,LXXIX,Forth of our troop may ten well spared be
3521,LXXIX,"To succor her, which naught can weaken thee."
3522,LXXIX,
3523,LXXX,LXXX
3524,LXXX,"“And know, they shall in God’s high service fight,"
3525,LXXX,That virgins innocent save and defend:
3526,LXXX,"Dear will the spoils be in the Heaven’s sight,"
3527,LXXX,That from a tyrant’s hateful head we rend:
3528,LXXX,"Nor seemed I forward in this lady’s right,"
3529,LXXX,With hope of gain or profit in the end;
3530,LXXX,"But for I know he arms unworthy bears,"
3531,LXXX,To help a maiden’s cause that shuns or fears.

3533,LXXXI,LXXXI
3534,LXXXI,"“Ah!  be it not pardie declared in France,"
3535,LXXXI,"Or elsewhere told where courtesy is in prize,"
3536,LXXXI,"That we forsook so fair a chevisance,"
3537,LXXXI,For doubt or fear that might from fight arise;
3538,LXXXI,"Else, here surrender I both sword and lance,"
3539,LXXXI,And swear no more to use this martial guise;
3540,LXXXI,"For ill deserves he to be termed a knight,"

3547,LXXXII,"With humble grace, and earnest suit they prayed:"
3548,LXXXII,"“I yield,” quoth he, “and it be happy found,"

3557,LXXXIII,"Accept his grant, and let his counsel go."
3558,LXXXIII,"What works not beauty, man’s relenting mind"
3559,LXXXIII,Is eath to move with plaints and shows of woe:
3560,LXXXIII,"Her lips cast forth a chain of sugared words,"
3561,LXXXIII,That captive led most of the Christian lords.
3562,LXXXIII,
3563,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
3564,LXXXIV,"Eustace recalled her, and bespake her thus:"
3565,LXXXIV,"“Beauty’s chief darling, let those sorrows be,"
3566,LXXXIV,For such assistance shall you find in us
3567,LXXXIV,"As with your need, or will, may best agree:”"
3568,LXXXIV,"With that she cheered her forehead dolorous,"
3569,LXXXIV,"And smiled for joy, that Phoebus blushed to see,"
3570,LXXXIV,"And had she deigned her veil for to remove,"
3571,LXXXIV,The God himself once more had fallen in love.
3572,LXXXIV,
3573,LXXXV,LXXXV
3574,LXXXV,"With that she broke the silence once again,"
3575,LXXXV,"And gave the knight great thanks in little speech,"
3576,LXXXV,"She said she would his handmaid poor remain,"
3577,LXXXV,So far as honor’s laws received no breach.
3578,LXXXV,"Her humble gestures made the residue plain,"
3579,LXXXV,"Dumb eloquence, persuading more than speech:"
3580,LXXXV,"Thus women know, and thus they use the guise,"
3581,LXXXV,"To enchant the valiant, and beguile the wise."
3582,LXXXV,

3585,LXXXVI,"Some wished mean of quick and good proceeding,"
3586,LXXXVI,"She thought to strike the iron that was hot,"
3587,LXXXVI,For every action hath his hour of speeding:
3588,LXXXVI,Medea or false Circe changed not
3589,LXXXVI,"So far the shapes of men, as her eyes spreading"
3590,LXXXVI,"Altered their hearts, and with her syren’s sound"
3591,LXXXVI,"In lust, their minds, their hearts, in love she drowned."
3592,LXXXVI,
3593,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
3594,LXXXVII,"All wily sleights that subtle women know,"
3595,LXXXVII,"Hourly she used, to catch some lover new."
3596,LXXXVII,"None kenned the bent of her unsteadfast bow,"
3597,LXXXVII,"For with the time her thoughts her looks renew,"
3598,LXXXVII,"From some she cast her modest eyes below,"
3599,LXXXVII,"At some her gazing glances roving flew,"
3600,LXXXVII,"And while she thus pursued her wanton sport,"
3601,LXXXVII,"She spurred the slow, and reined the forward short."

3604,LXXXVIII,"If some, as hopeless that she would be won,"
3605,LXXXVIII,"Forebore to love, because they durst not move her,"
3606,LXXXVIII,"On them her gentle looks to smile begun,"
3607,LXXXVIII,As who say she is kind if you dare prove her
3608,LXXXVIII,"On every heart thus shone this lustful sun,"
3609,LXXXVIII,"All strove to serve, to please, to woo, to love her,"
3610,LXXXVIII,"And in their hearts that chaste and bashful were,"
3611,LXXXVIII,Her eye’s hot glance dissolved the frost of fear.
3612,LXXXVIII,

3614,LXXXIX,On them who durst with fingering bold assay
3615,LXXXIX,"To touch the softness of her tender skin,"
3616,LXXXIX,"She looked as coy, as if she list not play,"
3617,LXXXIX,And made as things of worth were hard to win;
3618,LXXXIX,"Yet tempered so her deignful looks alway,"
3619,LXXXIX,That outward scorn showed store of grace within:
3620,LXXXIX,"Thus with false hope their longing hearts she fired,"
3621,LXXXIX,For hardest gotten things are most desired.

3628,XC,And with this craft a thousand souls well near
3629,XC,"In snares of foolish ruth and love she hent,"

3639,XCI,The sunshine of her face in lustre bettered:

3661,XCIII,She had not learned the gamut then of love.
3662,XCIII,
3663,XCIV,XCIV

3667,XCIV,Upon the bright enamel of her face;

3669,XCIV,When Phoebus holds the crimson morn in chase;
3670,XCIV,"Full seemed her looks of anger, and of shame;"

3684,XCVI,These were the arts by which she captived
3685,XCVI,A thousand souls of young and lusty knights;
3686,XCVI,These were the arms wherewith love conquered
3687,XCVI,Their feeble hearts subdued in wanton fights:
3688,XCVI,"What wonder if Achilles were misled,"
3689,XCVI,"Of great Alcides at their ladies’ sights,"
3690,XCVI,Since these true champions of the Lord above
3691,XCVI,"Were thralls to beauty, yielden slaves to lore."

3775,VII,There where the lamp of Cupid gave the light:

3825,XII,"To strike him sure, the fire in him was dead;"

3827,XII,Nor cared he for the journey or the maid.

3831,XIII,"Dudon’s high prowess, death and burial,"

3833,XIII,Praising his fortunes for that worthy’s fall;
3834,XIII,"Besides, the knight’s sweet words and praises soft"

3843,XIV,Would I for that to higher place aspire:
3844,XIV,"But if to honors due raise me you would,"

3854,XV,"But Prince Gernando coveted the place,"
3855,XV,"Whom though Armida sought to undermine,"
3856,XV,"Gainst him yet vain did all her engines prove,"
3857,XV,"His pride was such, there was no place for love."

3859,XVI,XVI
3860,XVI,"Gernando was the King of Norway’s son,"
3861,XVI,"That many a realm and region had to guide,"
3862,XVI,And for his elders lands and crowns had won.
3863,XVI,His heart was puffed up with endless pride:
3864,XVI,The other boasts more what himself had done
3865,XVI,Than all his ancestors’ great acts beside;
3866,XVI,Yet his forefathers old before him were
3867,XVI,Famous in war and peace five hundred years.
3868,XVI,
3869,XVII,XVII
3870,XVII,"This barbarous prince, who only vainly thought"
3871,XVII,"That bliss in wealth and kingly power doth lie,"
3872,XVII,And in respect esteemed all virtue naught
3873,XVII,"Unless it were adorned with titles high,"
3874,XVII,"Could not endure, that to the place he sought"
3875,XVII,A simple knight should dare to press so nigh;
3876,XVII,"And in his breast so boiled fell despite,"
3877,XVII,That ire and wrath exiled reason quite.

3879,XVIII,XVIII
3880,XVIII,"The hidden devil, that lies in close await"
3881,XVIII,"To win the fort of unbelieving man,"
3882,XVIII,"Found entry there, where ire undid the gate,"
3883,XVIII,And in his bosom unperceived ran;
3884,XVIII,"It filled his heart with malice, strife and hate,"
3885,XVIII,"It made him rage, blaspheme, swear, curse and ban,"
3886,XVIII,"Invisible it still attends him near,"
3887,XVIII,And thus each minute whispereth in his ear.
3888,XVIII,
3889,XIX,XIX
3890,XIX,"What, shall Rinaldo match thee?  dares he tell"
3891,XIX,Those idle names of his vain pedigree?

3893,XIX,"What lands, what realms his tributaries be:"
3894,XIX,"If his forefathers in the graves that dwell,"
3895,XIX,"Were honored like thine that live, let see:"

3897,XIX,Born in that servile country Italy?
3898,XIX,
3899,XX,XX
3900,XX,"Now, if he win, or if he lose the day,"

3903,XX,"Lo, this is he that with Gernando strived."

3913,XXI,"What wrath, what anger in his face appear,"

3915,XXI,Marking how high he doth his feathers rear?
3916,XXI,"Seeing his rash attempt, how soon he dare,"
3917,XXI,"Though but a boy, with his great worth compare."
3918,XXI,
3919,XXII,XXII
3920,XXII,"He dares not only, but he strives and proves,"
3921,XXII,Where chastisement were fit there wins he praise:
3922,XXII,"One counsels him, his speech him forward moves;"
3923,XXII,Another fool approveth all he says:
3924,XXII,"If Godfrey favor him more than behoves,"
3925,XXII,Why then he wrongeth thee an hundred ways;
3926,XXII,"Nor let thy state so far disgraced be,"
3927,XXII,"Now what thou art and canst, let Godfrey see."
3928,XXII,
3929,XXIII,XXIII
3930,XXIII,With such false words the kindled fire began
3931,XXIII,"To every vein his poisoned heart to reach,"
3932,XXIII,"It swelled his scornful heart, and forth it ran"
3933,XXIII,"At his proud looks, and too audacious speech;"
3934,XXIII,"All that he thought blameworthy in the man,"
3935,XXIII,To his disgrace that would be each where preach;
3936,XXIII,"He termed him proud and vain, his worth in fight"
3937,XXIII,"He called fool-hardise, rashness, madness right."
3938,XXIII,
3939,XXIV,XXIV
3940,XXIV,"All that in him was rare or excellent,"
3941,XXIV,"All that was good, all that was princely found,"
3942,XXIV,"With such sharp words as malice could invent,"
3943,XXIV,"He blamed, such power has wicked tongue to wound."
3944,XXIV,"The youth, for everywhere those rumors went,"
3945,XXIV,Of these reproaches heard sometimes the sound;
3946,XXIV,"Nor did for that his tongue the fault amend,"
3947,XXIV,Until it brought him to his woful end.
3948,XXIV,
3949,XXV,XXV
3950,XXV,"The cursed fiend that set his tongue at large,"
3951,XXV,"Still bred more fancies in his idle brain,"
3952,XXV,"His heart with slanders new did overcharge,"
3953,XXV,And soothed him still in his angry vein;
3954,XXV,"Amid the camp a place was broad and large,"
3955,XXV,Where one fair regiment might easily train;
3956,XXV,And there in tilt and harmless tournament
3957,XXV,Their days of rest the youths and gallants spent.
3958,XXV,
3959,XXVI,XXVI
3960,XXVI,"There, as his fortune would it should betide,"
3961,XXVI,"Amid the press Gernando gan retire,"
3962,XXVI,"To vomit out his venom unespied,"
3963,XXVI,Wherewith foul envy did his heart inspire.
3964,XXVI,"Rinaldo heard him as he stood beside,"
3965,XXVI,"And as he could not bridle wrath and ire,"
3966,XXVI,"“Thou liest,” cried he loud, and with that word"
3967,XXVI,About his head he tossed his flaming sword.
3968,XXVI,
3969,XXVII,XXVII
3970,XXVII,"Thunder his voice, and lightning seemed his brand,"
3971,XXVII,"So fell his look, and furious was his cheer,"
3972,XXVII,"Gernando trembled, for he saw at hand"
3973,XXVII,"Pale death, and neither help nor comfort near,"
3974,XXVII,Yet for the soldiers all to witness stand
3975,XXVII,"He made proud sign, as though he naught did fear,"
3976,XXVII,"But bravely drew his little-helping blade,"
3977,XXVII,And valiant show of strong resistance made.
3978,XXVII,
3979,XXVIII,XXVIII
3980,XXVIII,With that a thousand blades of burnished steel
3981,XXVIII,"Glistered on heaps like flames of fire in sight,"
3982,XXVIII,"Hundreds, that knew not yet the quarrel weel,"
3983,XXVIII,"Ran thither, some to gaze and some to fight:"
3984,XXVIII,The empty air a sound confused did feel
3985,XXVIII,"Of murmurs low, and outcries loud on height,"
3986,XXVIII,Like rolling waves and Boreas’ angry blasts
3987,XXVIII,When roaring seas against the rocks he casts.
3988,XXVIII,
3989,XXIX,XXIX
3990,XXIX,But not for this the wronged warrior stayed
3991,XXIX,"His just displeasure and incensed ire,"
3992,XXIX,"He cared not what the vulgar did or said,"
3993,XXIX,To vengeance did his courage fierce aspire:
3994,XXIX,"Among the thickest weapons way he made,"
3995,XXIX,"His thundering sword made all on heaps retire,"
3996,XXIX,"So that of near a thousand stayed not one,"
3997,XXIX,But Prince Gernando bore the brunt alone.
3998,XXIX,
3999,XXX,XXX
4000,XXX,"His hand, too quick to execute his wrath,"
4001,XXX,"Performed all, as pleased his eye and heart,"
4002,XXX,"At head and breast oft times he strucken hath,"
4003,XXX,"Now at the right, now at the other part:"
4004,XXX,"On every side thus did he harm and scath,"
4005,XXX,"And oft beguile his sight with nimble art,"
4006,XXX,"That no defence the prince of wounds acquits,"
4007,XXX,"Where least he thinks, or fears, there most he hits."
4008,XXX,
4009,XXXI,XXXI
4010,XXXI,"Nor ceased be, till in Gernando’s breast"
4011,XXXI,He sheathed once or twice his furious blade;
4012,XXXI,"Down fell the hapless prince with death oppressed,"
4013,XXXI,A double way to his weak soul was made;
4014,XXXI,"His bloody sword the victor wiped and dressed,"
4015,XXXI,"Nor longer by the slaughtered body stayed,"
4016,XXXI,"But sped him thence, and soon appeased hath"
4017,XXXI,"His hate, his ire, his rancor and his wrath."
4018,XXXI,
4019,XXXII,XXXII
4020,XXXII,"Called by the tumult, Godfrey drew him near,"
4021,XXXII,"And there beheld a sad and rueful sight,"
4022,XXXII,"The signs of death upon his face appear,"
4023,XXXII,"With dust and blood his locks were loathly dight,"
4024,XXXII,"Sighs and complaints on each side might he hear,"
4025,XXXII,Made for the sudden death of that great knight:
4026,XXXII,"Amazed, he asked who durst and did so much;"
4027,XXXII,For yet he knew not whom the fault would touch.
4028,XXXII,
4029,XXXIII,XXXIII
4030,XXXIII,"Arnoldo, minion of the Prince thus slain,"
4031,XXXIII,"Augments the fault in telling it, and saith,"
4032,XXXIII,"This Prince murdered, for a quarrel vain,"
4033,XXXIII,"By young Rinaldo in his desperate wrath,"
4034,XXXIII,"And with that sword that should Christ’s law maintain,"
4035,XXXIII,"One of Christ’s champions bold he killed hath,"
4036,XXXIII,"And this he did in such a place and hour,"
4037,XXXIII,"As if he scorned your rule, despised your power."
4038,XXXIII,
4039,XXXIV,XXXIV
4040,XXXIV,"And further adds, that he deserved death"
4041,XXXIV,"By law, and law should inviolate,"
4042,XXXIV,"That none offence could greater be uneath,"
4043,XXXIV,And yet the place the fault did aggravate:
4044,XXXIV,"If he escapes, that mischief would take breath,"
4045,XXXIV,And flourish bold in spite of rule and state;
4046,XXXIV,"And that Gernando’s friends would venge the wrong,"
4047,XXXIV,"Although to justice that did first belong,"
4048,XXXIV,
4049,XXXV,XXXV
4050,XXXV,"And by that means, should discord, hate and strife"
4051,XXXV,"Raise mutinies, and what therefore ensueth:"
4052,XXXV,"Lastly he praised the dead, and still had rife"
4053,XXXV,All words he thought could vengeance move or rut
4054,XXXV,"Against him Tancred argued for life,"
4055,XXXV,With honest reasons to excuse the youth:
4056,XXXV,"The Duke heard all, but with such sober cheer,"
4057,XXXV,"As banished hope, and still increased fear."
4058,XXXV,
4059,XXXVI,XXXVI
4060,XXXVI,"“Great Prince,” quoth Tancred; “set before thine eyes"
4061,XXXVI,"Rinaldo’s worth and courage what it is,"
4062,XXXVI,How much our hope of conquest in him lies;
4063,XXXVI,Regard that princely house and race of his;
4064,XXXVI,"He that correcteth every fault he spies,"
4065,XXXVI,"And judgeth all alike, doth all amiss;"
4066,XXXVI,"For faults, you know, are greater thought or less,"
4067,XXXVI,As is the person’s self that doth transgress.”
4068,XXXVI,
4069,XXXVII,XXXVII
4070,XXXVII,Godfredo answered him; “If high and low
4071,XXXVII,"Of sovereign power alike should feel the stroke,"
4072,XXXVII,"Then, Tancred, ill you counsel us, I trow;"
4073,XXXVII,"If lords should know no law, as erst you spoke,"
4074,XXXVII,"How vile and base our empire were you know,"
4075,XXXVII,If none but slaves and peasants bear the yoke;
4076,XXXVII,Weak is the sceptre and the power is small
4077,XXXVII,That such provisos bring annexed withal.
4078,XXXVII,
4079,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
4080,XXXVIII,"“But mine was freely given ere ’twas sought,"
4081,XXXVIII,Nor that it lessened be I now consent;
4082,XXXVIII,Right well know I both when and where I ought
4083,XXXVIII,"To give condign reward and punishment,"
4084,XXXVIII,"Since you are all in like subjection brought,"
4085,XXXVIII,"Both high and low obey, and be content.”"
4086,XXXVIII,"This heard, Tancredi wisely stayed his words,"
4087,XXXVIII,Such weight the sayings have of kings and lords.
4088,XXXVIII,
4089,XXXIX,XXXIX
4090,XXXIX,"Old Raymond praised his speech, for old men think"
4091,XXXIX,"They ever wisest seem when most severe,"
4092,XXXIX,"“’Tis best,” quoth he, “to make these great ones shrink,"
4093,XXXIX,The people love him whom the nobles fear:
4094,XXXIX,"There must the rule to all disorders sink,"
4095,XXXIX,Where pardons more than punishments appear;
4096,XXXIX,"For feeble is each kingdom, frail and weak,"
4097,XXXIX,Unless his basis be this fear I speak.”
4098,XXXIX,
4099,XL,XL
4100,XL,"These words Tancredi heard and pondered well,"
4101,XL,"And by them wist how Godfrey’s thoughts were bent,"
4102,XL,"Nor list he longer with these old men dwell,"
4103,XL,"But turned his horse and to Rinaldo went,"
4104,XL,"Who, when his noble foe death-wounded fell,"
4105,XL,Withdrew him softly to his gorgeous tent;
4106,XL,"There Tancred found him, and at large declared"
4107,XL,The words and speeches sharp which late you heard.
4108,XL,
4109,XLI,XLI
4110,XLI,"And said, “Although I wot the outward show"
4111,XLI,"Is not true witness of the secret thought,"
4112,XLI,"For that some men so subtle are, I trow,"
4113,XLI,That what they purpose most appeareth naught;
4114,XLI,"Yet dare I say Godfredo means, I know,"
4115,XLI,"Such knowledge hath his looks and speeches wrought,"
4116,XLI,"You shall first prisoner be, and then be tried"
4117,XLI,As he shall deem it good and law provide.”
4118,XLI,
4119,XLII,XLII
4120,XLII,With that a bitter smile well might you see
4121,XLII,"Rinaldo cast, with scorn and high disdain,"
4122,XLII,"“Let them in fetters plead their cause,” quoth he,"
4123,XLII,"“That are base peasants, born of servile stain,"
4124,XLII,"I was free born, I live and will die free"
4125,XLII,Before these feet be fettered in a chain:
4126,XLII,"These hands were made to shake sharp spears and swords,"
4127,XLII,Not to be tied in gyves and twisted cords.
4128,XLII,
4129,XLIII,XLIII
4130,XLIII,"“If my good service reap this recompense,"
4131,XLIII,"To be clapt up in close and secret mew,"
4132,XLIII,"And as a thief be after dragged from thence,"
4133,XLIII,To suffer punishment as law finds due;
4134,XLIII,"Let Godfrey come or send, I will not hence"
4135,XLIII,"Until we know who shall this bargain rue,"
4136,XLIII,That of our tragedy the late done fact
4137,XLIII,"May be the first, and this the second, act."

4139,XLIV,XLIV
4140,XLIV,"“Give me mine arms,” he cried; his squire them brings,"
4141,XLIV,"And clad his head, and dressed in iron strong,"
4142,XLIV,"About his neck his silver shield he flings,"
4143,XLIV,Down by his side a cutting sword there hung;
4144,XLIV,"Among this earth’s brave lords and mighty kings,"
4145,XLIV,"Was none so stout, so fierce, so fair, so young,"
4146,XLIV,"God Mars he seemed descending from his sphere,"
4147,XLIV,Or one whose looks could make great Mars to fear.

4149,XLV,XLV
4150,XLV,Tancredi labored with some pleasing speech
4151,XLV,His spirits fierce and courage to appease;

4153,XLV,"“Can chastise all that do thee wrong, at ease,"
4154,XLV,"I know your virtue can your enemies teach,"
4155,XLV,That you can venge you when and where you please:
4156,XLV,But God forbid this day you lift your arm
4157,XLV,To do this camp and us your friends such harm.
4158,XLV,
4159,XLVI,XLVI
4160,XLVI,“Tell me what will you do?  why would you stain
4161,XLVI,Your noble hands in our unguilty blood?
4162,XLVI,"By wounding Christians, will you again"
4163,XLVI,"Pierce Christ, whose parts they are and members good?"
4164,XLVI,"Will you destroy us for your glory vain,"
4165,XLVI,Unstayed as rolling waves in ocean flood?
4166,XLVI,"Far be it from you so to prove your strength,"
4167,XLVI,And let your zeal appease your rage at length.
4168,XLVI,
4169,XLVII,XLVII
4170,XLVII,"“For God’s love stay your heat, and just displeasure,"
4171,XLVII,"Appease your wrath, your courage fierce assuage,"
4172,XLVII,"Patience, a praise; forbearance, is a treasure;"
4173,XLVII,"Suffrance, an angel’s is; a monster, rage;"
4174,XLVII,"At least you actions by example measure,"
4175,XLVII,And think how I in mine unbridled age
4176,XLVII,"Was wronged, yet I would not revengement take"
4177,XLVII,"On all this camp, for one offender’s sake."

4184,XLVIII,"He seemed my friend, and I discovered not"
4185,XLVIII,His secret covetise which since appeared;

4193,XLIX,"Your liberty, as men of honor use:"
4194,XLIX,To Antioch what if forthwith you went?
4195,XLIX,"And leave me here your absence to excuse,"

4225,LII,"And kill their kings from Egypt unto Inde,"
4226,LII,From Cynthia’s hills and Nilus’ unknown spring

4764,XII,
4765,XIII,XIII
4766,XIII,"“Perchance he comes some heavenly messenger,"
4767,XIII,"Sent down to set the Pagan people free,"
4768,XIII,"Then let Argantes for himself take care,"
4769,XIII,"This sword, I trust, shall well safe-conduct me:"
4770,XIII,"But while you rest and all your forces spare,"
4771,XIII,That I go forth to war at least agree;
4772,XIII,"Though not your champion, yet a private knight,"
4773,XIII,I will some Christian prove in single fight.”
4774,XIII,
4775,XIV,XIV
4776,XIV,"The king replied, “Though thy force and might"
4777,XIV,Should be reserved to better time and use;
4778,XIV,"Yet that thou challenge some renowned knight,"
4779,XIV,Among the Christians bold I not refuse.”
4780,XIV,"The warrior breathing out desire of fight,"
4781,XIV,"An herald called, and said, “Go tell those news"
4782,XIV,"To Godfrey’s self, and to the western lords,"
4783,XIV,And in their hearings boldly say these words:
4784,XIV,
4785,XV,XV
4786,XV,"“Say that a knight, who holds in great disdain"
4787,XV,"To be thus closed up in secret mew,"
4788,XV,"Will with his sword in open field maintain,"
4789,XV,"If any dare deny his words for true,"
4790,XV,"That no devotion, as they falsely feign,"
4791,XV,Hath moved the French these countries to subdue;
4792,XV,"But vile ambition, and pride’s hateful vice,"
4793,XV,"Desire of rule, and spoil, and covetice."
4794,XV,
4795,XVI,XVI
4796,XVI,“And that to fight I am not only prest
4797,XVI,"With one or two that dare defend the cause,"
4798,XVI,"But come the fourth or fifth, come all the rest,"
4799,XVI,"Come all that will, and all that weapon draws,"
4800,XVI,"Let him that yields obey the victor’s hest,"
4801,XVI,As wills the lore of mighty Mars his laws:”
4802,XVI,"This was the challenge that fierce Pagan sent,"
4803,XVI,"The herald donned his coat-of-arms, and went."
4804,XVI,
4805,XVII,XVII
4806,XVII,And when the man before the presence came
4807,XVII,"Of princely Godfrey, and his captains bold:"
4808,XVII,"“My Lord,” quoth he, “may I withouten blame"
4809,XVII,"Before your Grace, my message brave unfold?”"
4810,XVII,"“Thou mayest,” he answered, “we approve the same;"
4811,XVII,"Withouten fear, be thine ambassage told.”"
4812,XVII,"“Then,” quoth the herald, “shall your highness see,"
4813,XVII,If this ambassage sharp or pleasing be.”
4814,XVII,
4815,XVIII,XVIII
4816,XVIII,"The challenge gan he then at large expose,"
4817,XVIII,"With mighty threats, high terms and glorious words;"
4818,XVIII,"On every side an angry murmur rose,"
4819,XVIII,To wrath so moved were the knights and lords.
4820,XVIII,"Then Godfrey spake, and said, “The man hath chose"
4821,XVIII,"An hard exploit, but when he feels our swords,"
4822,XVIII,"I trust we shall so far entreat the knight,"
4823,XVIII,As to excuse the fourth or fifth of fight.
4824,XVIII,
4825,XIX,XIX
4826,XIX,"“But let him come and prove, the field I grant,"
4827,XIX,"Nor wrong nor treason let him doubt or fear,"
4828,XIX,"Some here shall pay him for his glorious vaunt,"
4829,XIX,"Without or guile, or vantage, that I swear."
4830,XIX,"The herald turned when he had ended scant,"
4831,XIX,"And hasted back the way he came whileare,"
4832,XIX,"Nor stayed he aught, nor once forslowed his pace,"
4833,XIX,Till he bespake Argantes face to face.
4834,XIX,
4835,XX,XX
4836,XX,"“Arm you, my lord,” he said, “your bold defies"
4837,XX,"By your brave foes accepted boldly been,"
4838,XX,"This combat neither high nor low denies,"
4839,XX,Ten thousand wish to meet you on the green;
4840,XX,"A thousand frowned with angry flaming eyes,"
4841,XX,And shaked for rage their swords and weapons keen;
4842,XX,"The field is safely granted by their guide,”"
4843,XX,"This said, the champion for his armor cried."
4844,XX,
4845,XXI,XXI
4846,XXI,"While he was armed, his heart for ire nigh brake,"
4847,XXI,So yearned his courage hot his foes to find:
4848,XXI,The King to fair Clorinda present spake;
4849,XXI,"“If he go forth, remain not you behind,"
4850,XXI,"But of our soldiers best a thousand take,"
4851,XXI,To guard his person and your own assigned;
4852,XXI,"Yet let him meet alone the Christian knight,"
4853,XXI,"And stand yourself aloof, while they two fight.”"
4854,XXI,
4855,XXII,XXII
4856,XXII,"Thus spake the King, and soon without abode"
4857,XXII,"The troop went forth in shining armor clad,"
4858,XXII,"Before the rest the Pagan champion rode,"
4859,XXII,His wonted arms and ensigns all he had:
4860,XXII,"A goodly plain displayed wide and broad,"
4861,XXII,"Between the city and the camp was spread,"
4862,XXII,A place like that wherein proud Rome beheld
4863,XXII,The forward young men manage spear and shield.
4864,XXII,
4865,XXIII,XXIII
4866,XXIII,"There all alone Argantes took his stand,"
4867,XXIII,"Defying Christ and all his servants true,"
4868,XXIII,"In stature, stomach, and in strength of hand,"
4869,XXIII,"In pride, presumption, and in dreadful show,"
4870,XXIII,"Encelade like, on the Phlegrean strand,"
4871,XXIII,Or that huge giant Jesse’s infant slew;
4872,XXIII,"But his fierce semblant they esteemed light,"
4873,XXIII,"For most not knew, or else not feared his might."
4874,XXIII,
4875,XXIV,XXIV
4876,XXIV,As yet not one had Godfrey singled out
4877,XXIV,"To undertake this hardy enterprise,"
4878,XXIV,But on Prince Tancred saw he all the rout
4879,XXIV,"Had fixed their wishes, and had cast their eyes,"
4880,XXIV,"On him he spied them gazing round about,"
4881,XXIV,"As though their honor on his prowess lies,"
4882,XXIV,"And now they whispered louder what they meant,"
4883,XXIV,"Which Godfrey heard and saw, and was content."
4884,XXIV,
4885,XXV,XXV
4886,XXV,The rest gave place; for every one descried
4887,XXV,"To whom their chieftain’s will did most incline,"
4888,XXV,"“Tancred,” quoth he, “I pray thee calm the pride,"
4889,XXV,Abate the rage of yonder Saracine:”
4890,XXV,"No longer would the chosen champion bide,"
4891,XXV,"His face with joy, his eyes with gladness shine,"
4892,XXV,"His helm he took, and ready steed bestrode,"
4893,XXV,And guarded with his trusty friends forth rode.
4894,XXV,
4895,XXVI,XXVI
4896,XXVI,But scantly had he spurred his courser swift
4897,XXVI,"Near to the plain, where proud Argantes stayed,"
4898,XXVI,"When unawares his eyes he chanced to lift,"
4899,XXVI,"And on the hill beheld the warlike maid,"
4900,XXVI,As white as snow upon the Alpine clift
4901,XXVI,"The virgin shone in silver arms arrayed,"
4902,XXVI,"Her vental up so high, that he descried"
4903,XXVI,"Her goodly visage, and her beauty’s pride."
4904,XXVI,
4905,XXVII,XXVII
4906,XXVII,"He saw not where the Pagan stood, and stared,"
4907,XXVII,"As if with looks he would his foeman kill,"
4908,XXVII,"But full of other thoughts he forward fared,"
4909,XXVII,"And sent his looks before him up the hill,"
4910,XXVII,"His gesture such his troubled soul declared,"
4911,XXVII,"At last as marble rock he standeth still,"
4912,XXVII,"Stone cold without; within, burnt with love’s flame,"
4913,XXVII,"And quite forgot himself, and why he came."
4914,XXVII,
4915,XXVIII,XXVIII
4916,XXVIII,"The challenger, that yet saw none appear"
4917,XXVIII,"That made or sign or show he came to just,"
4918,XXVIII,"“How long,” cried he, “shall I attend you here?"
4919,XXVIII,Dares none come forth?  dares none his fortune trust?”
4920,XXVIII,"The other stood amazed, love stopped his ear,"
4921,XXVIII,"He thinks on Cupid, think of Mars who lust;"
4922,XXVIII,"But forth stert Otho bold, and took the field,"
4923,XXVIII,A gentle knight whom God from danger shield.
4924,XXVIII,
4925,XXIX,XXIX
4926,XXIX,"This youth was one of those, who late desired"
4927,XXIX,"With that vain-glorious boaster to have fought,"
4928,XXIX,"But Tancred chosen, he and all retired;"
4929,XXIX,"Now when his slackness he awhile admired,"
4930,XXIX,"And saw elsewhere employed was his thought,"
4931,XXIX,"Nor that to just, though chosen, once he proffered,"
4932,XXIX,He boldly took that fit occasion offered.
4933,XXIX,
4934,XXX,XXX
4935,XXX,"No tiger, panther, spotted leopard,"
4936,XXX,"Runs half so swift, the forests wild among,"
4937,XXX,"As this young champion hasted thitherward,"
4938,XXX,Where he attending saw the Pagan strong:
4939,XXX,"Tancredi started with the noise he heard,"
4940,XXX,"As waked from sleep, where he had dreamed long,"
4941,XXX,"“Oh stay,” he cried, “to me belongs this war!”"
4942,XXX,"But cried too late, Otho was gone too far."
4943,XXX,
4944,XXXI,XXXI
4945,XXXI,"Then full of fury, anger and despite,"
4946,XXXI,"He stayed his horse, and waxed red for shame,"
4947,XXXI,"The fight was his, but now disgraced quite"
4948,XXXI,"Himself he thought, another played his game;"
4949,XXXI,Meanwhile the Saracen did hugely smite
4950,XXXI,"On Otho’s helm, who to requite the same,"
4951,XXXI,"His foe quite through his sevenfold targe did bear,"
4952,XXXI,And in his breastplate stuck and broke his spear.
4953,XXXI,
4954,XXXII,XXXII
4955,XXXII,"The encounter such, upon the tender grass,"
4956,XXXII,Down from his steed the Christian backward fell;
4957,XXXII,"Yet his proud foe so strong and sturdy was,"
4958,XXXII,"That he nor shook, nor staggered in his sell,"
4959,XXXII,"But to the knight that lay full low, alas,"
4960,XXXII,"In high disdain his will thus gan he tell,"
4961,XXXII,"“Yield thee my slave, and this thine honor be,"
4962,XXXII,Thou may’st report thou hast encountered me.”
4963,XXXII,
4964,XXXIII,XXXIII
4965,XXXIII,"“Not so,” quoth he, “pardy it’s not the guise"
4966,XXXIII,"Of Christian knights, though fall’n, so soon to yield;"
4967,XXXIII,"I can my fall excuse in better wise,"
4968,XXXIII,"And will revenge this shame, or die in field.”"
4969,XXXIII,"The great Circassian bent his frowning eyes,"
4970,XXXIII,"Like that grim visage in Minerva’s shield,"
4971,XXXIII,"“Then learn,” quoth he, “what force Argantes useth"
4972,XXXIII,Against that fool that proffered grace refuseth.”
4973,XXXIII,
4974,XXXIV,XXXIV
4975,XXXIV,"With that he spurred his horse with speed and haste,"
4976,XXXIV,"Forgetting what good knights to virtue owe,"
4977,XXXIV,"Otho his fury shunned, and, as he passed,"
4978,XXXIV,"At his right side he reached a noble blow,"
4979,XXXIV,"Wide was the wound, the blood outstreamed fast,"
4980,XXXIV,And from his side fell to his stirrup low:
4981,XXXIV,"But what avails to hurt, if wounds augment"
4982,XXXIV,"Our foe’s fierce courage, strength and hardiment?"
4983,XXXIV,
4984,XXXV,XXXV
4985,XXXV,"Argantes nimbly turned his ready steed,"
4986,XXXV,"And ere his foe was wist or well aware,"
4987,XXXV,"Against his side he drove his courser’s head,"
4988,XXXV,What force could he gainst so great might prepare?
4989,XXXV,"Weak were his feeble joints, his courage dead,"
4990,XXXV,"His heart amazed, his paleness showed his care,"
4991,XXXV,"His tender side gainst the hard earth he cast,"
4992,XXXV,"Shamed, with the first fall; bruised, with the last."
4993,XXXV,
4994,XXXVI,XXXVI
4995,XXXVI,"The victor spurred again his light-foot steed,"
4996,XXXVI,"And made his passage over Otho’s heart,"
4997,XXXVI,"And cried, “These fools thus under foot I tread,"
4998,XXXVI,That dare contend with me in equal mart.”
4999,XXXVI,"Tancred for anger shook his noble head,"
5000,XXXVI,So was he grieved with that unknightly part;
5001,XXXVI,"The fault was his, he was so slow before,"
5002,XXXVI,With double valor would he salve that sore.
5003,XXXVI,
5004,XXXVII,XXXVII
5005,XXXVII,"Forward he galloped fast, and loudly cried:"
5006,XXXVII,"“Villain,” quoth he, “thy conquest is thy shame,"
5007,XXXVII,What praise?  what honor shall this fact betide?
5008,XXXVII,What gain?  what guerdon shall befall the same?
5009,XXXVII,"Among the Arabian thieves thy face go hide,"
5010,XXXVII,"Far from resort of men of worth and fame,"
5011,XXXVII,"Or else in woods and mountains wild, by night,"
5012,XXXVII,On savage beasts employ thy savage might.”
5013,XXXVII,
5014,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
5015,XXXVIII,"The Pagan patience never knew, nor used,"
5016,XXXVIII,"Trembling for ire, his sandy locks he tore,"
5017,XXXVIII,"Out from his lips flew such a sound confused,"
5018,XXXVIII,"As lions make in deserts thick, which roar;"
5019,XXXVIII,"Or as when clouds together crushed and bruised,"
5020,XXXVIII,Pour down a tempest by the Caspian shore;
5021,XXXVIII,"So was his speech imperfect, stopped, and broken,"
5022,XXXVIII,He roared and thundered when he should have spoken.
5023,XXXVIII,
5024,XXXIX,XXXIX
5025,XXXIX,But when with threats they both had whetted keen
5026,XXXIX,"Their eager rage, their fury, spite and ire,"
5027,XXXIX,They turned their steeds and left large space between
5028,XXXIX,"To make their forces greater,   ’proaching nigher,"
5029,XXXIX,With terms that warlike and that worthy been:
5030,XXXIX,"O sacred Muse, my haughty thoughts inspire,"
5031,XXXIX,And make a trumpet of my slender quill
5032,XXXIX,To thunder out this furious combat shrill.
5033,XXXIX,
5034,XL,XL
5035,XL,"These sons of Mavors bore, instead of spears,"
5036,XL,"Two knotty masts, which none but they could lift,"
5037,XL,"Each foaming steed so fast his master bears,"
5038,XL,"That never beast, bird, shaft flew half so swift;"
5039,XL,"Such was their fury, as when Boreas tears"
5040,XL,"The shattered crags from Taurus’ northern clift,"
5041,XL,"Upon their helms their lances long they broke,"
5042,XL,"And up to heaven flew splinters, sparks and smoke."
5043,XL,
5044,XLI,XLI
5045,XLI,"The shock made all the towers and turrets quake,"
5046,XLI,And woods and mountains all nigh hand resound;
5047,XLI,Yet could not all that force and fury shake
5048,XLI,"The valiant champions, nor their persons wound;"
5049,XLI,"Together hurtled both their steeds, and brake"
5050,XLI,"Each other’s neck, the riders lay on ground:"
5051,XLI,"But they, great masters of war’s dreadful art,"
5052,XLI,Plucked forth their swords and soon from earth up start.

5054,XLII,XLII
5055,XLII,"Close at his surest ward each warrior lieth,"
5056,XLII,"He wisely guides his hand, his foot, his eye,"
5057,XLII,"This blow he proveth, that defence he trieth,"
5058,XLII,"He traverseth, retireth, presseth nigh,"
5059,XLII,"Now strikes he out, and now he falsifieth,"
5060,XLII,"This blow he wardeth, that he lets slip by,"
5061,XLII,And for advantage oft he lets some part
5062,XLII,Discovered seem; thus art deludeth art.
5063,XLII,
5064,XLIII,XLIII
5065,XLIII,"The Pagan ill defenced with sword or targe,"
5066,XLIII,"Tancredi’s thigh, as he supposed, espied"
5067,XLIII,"And reaching forth  gainst it his weapon large,"
5068,XLIII,Quite naked to his foe leaves his left-side;
5069,XLIII,"Tancred avoideth quick his furious charge,"
5070,XLIII,"And gave him eke a wound deep, sore and wide;"
5071,XLIII,"That done, himself safe to his ward retired,"
5072,XLIII,"His courage praised by all, his skill admired."
5073,XLIII,
5074,XLIV,XLIV
5075,XLIV,"The proud Circassian saw his streaming blood,"
5076,XLIV,"Down from his wound, as from a fountain, running,"
5077,XLIV,"He sighed for rage, and trembled as he stood,"
5078,XLIV,"He blamed his fortune, folly, want of cunning;"
5079,XLIV,"He lift his sword aloft, for ire nigh wood,"
5080,XLIV,"And forward rushed: Tancred his fury shunning,"
5081,XLIV,"With a sharp thrust once more the Pagan hit,"
5082,XLIV,To his broad shoulder where his arm is knit.
5083,XLIV,
5084,XLV,XLV
5085,XLV,Like as a bear through pierced with a dart
5086,XLV,"Within the secret woods, no further flieth,"
5087,XLV,"But bites the senseless weapon mad with smart,"
5088,XLV,Seeking revenge till unrevenged she dieth;
5089,XLV,"So mad Argantes fared, when his proud heart"
5090,XLV,"Wound upon wound, and shame on shame espieth,"
5091,XLV,"Desire of vengeance so o’ercame his senses,"
5092,XLV,"That he forgot all dangers, all defences."
5093,XLV,
5094,XLVI,XLVI
5095,XLVI,"Uniting force extreme, with endless wrath,"
5096,XLVI,"Supporting both with youth and strength untired,"
5097,XLVI,"His thundering blows so fast about he layeth,"
5098,XLVI,That skies and earth the flying sparkles fired;
5099,XLVI,"His foe to strike one blow no leisure hath,"
5100,XLVI,"Scantly he breathed, though he oft desired,"
5101,XLVI,"His warlike skill and cunning all was waste,"
5102,XLVI,"Such was Argantes’ force, and such his haste."
5103,XLVI,
5104,XLVII,XLVII
5105,XLVII,Long time Tancredi had in vain attended
5106,XLVII,"When this huge storm should overblow and pass,"
5107,XLVII,"Some blows his mighty target well defended,"
5108,XLVII,"Some fell beside, and wounded deep the grass;"
5109,XLVII,"But when he saw the tempest never ended,"
5110,XLVII,"Nor that the Paynim’s force aught weaker was,"
5111,XLVII,"He high advanced his cutting sword at length,"
5112,XLVII,"And rage to rage opposed, and strength to strength."
5113,XLVII,
5114,XLVIII,XLVIII
5115,XLVIII,"Wrath bore the sway, both art and reason fail,"
5116,XLVIII,"Fury new force, and courage new supplies,"
5117,XLVIII,"Their armors forged were of metal frail,"
5118,XLVIII,"On every side thereof, huge cantels flies,"
5119,XLVIII,The land was strewed all with plate and mail.
5120,XLVIII,"That, on the earth; on that, their warm blood lies."
5121,XLVIII,And at each rush and every blow they smote
5122,XLVIII,"Thunder the noise, the sparks, seemed lightning hot."

5124,XLIX,XLIX
5125,XLIX,"The Christian people and the Pagans gazed,"

5170,LIII,What time for this exploit should fittest be:

5175,LIV,This fight was deep imprinted in their hearts

5323,LXVIII,
5324,LXIX,LXIX
5325,LXIX,Nor feared she among the bands to stray

5454,LXXXII,LXXXII
5455,LXXXII,"And sighing, softly to herself she said,"

5487,LXXXV,The bloody weapon in my wounded side
5488,LXXXV,Might cure the wound which love before had made;
5489,LXXXV,Then should my soul in rest and quiet slide
5490,LXXXV,"Down to the valleys of the Elysian shade,"

5610,XCVII,"New perils she descried, new doubts she cast."
5611,XCVII,"The way that her desire to quiet brought,"
5612,XCVII,More difficult now seemed than erst she thought.
5613,XCVII,
5614,XCVIII,XCVIII
5615,XCVIII,"Armed to ride among her angry foes,"
5616,XCVIII,"She now perceived it were great oversight,"
5617,XCVIII,"Yet would she not, she thought, herself disclose,"
5618,XCVIII,"Until she came before her chosen knight,"
5619,XCVIII,To him she purposed to present the rose
5620,XCVIII,"Pure, spotless, clean, untouched of mortal wight,"
5621,XCVIII,"She stayed therefore, and in her thoughts more wise,"

5659,CII,"And that which grieved her most, the careful squire"
5660,CII,Less speedy seemed than e’er before that day;

5710,CVII,"Those that brought victuals to their foes untamed,"

6051,XXVI,"That wished success to his desire denied,"
6052,XXVI,"And sharp revenge protested for the same,"
6053,XXVI,If aught but good his mistress fair betide;
6054,XXVI,"Then wished he to return the way he came,"
6055,XXVI,"Although he wist not by what path to ride,"
6056,XXVI,And time drew near when he again must fight
6057,XXVI,"With proud Argantes, that vain-glorious knight."
6058,XXVI,
6059,XXVII,XXVII
6060,XXVII,His stalwart steed the champion stout bestrode
6061,XXVII,"And pricked fast to find the way he lost,"
6062,XXVII,"But through a valley as he musing rode,"
6063,XXVII,"He saw a man that seemed for haste a post,"
6064,XXVII,"His horn was hung between his shoulders broad,"
6065,XXVII,As is the guise with us: Tancredi crossed
6066,XXVII,"His way, and gently prayed the man to say,"
6067,XXVII,To Godfrey’s camp how he should find the way.
6068,XXVII,
6069,XXVIII,XXVIII
6070,XXVIII,"“Sir,” in the Italian language answered he,"
6071,XXVIII,“I ride where noble Boemond hath me sent:”
6072,XXVIII,"The prince thought this his uncle’s man should be,"
6073,XXVIII,"And after him his course with speed he bent,"
6074,XXVIII,"A fortress stately built at last they see,"
6075,XXVIII,"Bout which a muddy stinking lake there went,"
6076,XXVIII,There they arrived when Titan went to rest
6077,XXVIII,His weary limbs in night’s untroubled nest.
6078,XXVIII,
6079,XXIX,XXIX
6080,XXIX,The courier gave the fort a warning blast;
6081,XXIX,The drawbridge was let down by them within:
6082,XXIX,"“If thou a Christian be,” quoth he, “thou mayest"
6083,XXIX,"Till Phoebus shine again, here take thine inn,"
6084,XXIX,"The County of Cosenza, three days past,"
6085,XXIX,This castle from the Turks did nobly win.”
6086,XXIX,"The prince beheld the piece, which site and art"
6087,XXIX,Impregnable had made on every part.
6088,XXIX,
6089,XXX,XXX
6090,XXX,He feared within a pile so fortified
6091,XXX,"Some secret treason or enchantment lay,"
6092,XXX,"But had he known even there he should have died,"
6093,XXX,Yet should his looks no sign of fear betray;
6094,XXX,"For wheresoever will or chance him guide,"
6095,XXX,His strong victorious hand still made him way:
6096,XXX,"Yet for the combat he must shortly make,"
6097,XXX,No new adventures list he undertake.
6098,XXX,
6099,XXXI,XXXI
6100,XXXI,"Before the castle, in a meadow plain"
6101,XXXI,"Beside the bridge’s end, he stayed and stood,"
6102,XXXI,Nor was entreated by the speeches vain
6103,XXXI,"Of his false guide, to pass beyond the flood."
6104,XXXI,"Upon the bridge appeared a warlike swain,"
6105,XXXI,"From top to toe all clad in armor good,"
6106,XXXI,"Who brandishing a broad and cutting sword,"
6107,XXXI,Thus threatened death with many an idle word.
6108,XXXI,
6109,XXXII,XXXII
6110,XXXII,"“O thou, whom chance or will brings to the soil,"
6111,XXXII,"Where fair Armida doth the sceptre guide,"
6112,XXXII,"Thou canst not fly, of arms thyself despoil,"
6113,XXXII,And let thy hands with iron chains be tied;
6114,XXXII,Enter and rest thee from thy weary toil.
6115,XXXII,"Within this dungeon shalt thou safe abide,"
6116,XXXII,"And never hope again to see the day,"
6117,XXXII,Or that thy hair for age shall turn to gray;
6118,XXXII,
6119,XXXIII,XXXIII
6120,XXXIII,“Except thou swear her valiant knights to aid
6121,XXXIII,Against those traitors of the Christian crew.”
6122,XXXIII,"Tancred at this discourse a little stayed,"
6123,XXXIII,"His arms, his gesture, and his voice he knew:"
6124,XXXIII,"It was Rambaldo, who for that false maid"
6125,XXXIII,"Forsook his country and religion true,"
6126,XXXIII,"And of that fort defender chief became,"
6127,XXXIII,And those vile customs stablished in the same.
6128,XXXIII,
6129,XXXIV,XXXIV
6130,XXXIV,"The warrior answered, blushing red for shame,"
6131,XXXIV,"“Cursed apostate, and ungracious wight,"
6132,XXXIV,I am that Tancred who defend the name
6133,XXXIV,"Of Christ, and have been aye his faithful knight;"
6134,XXXIV,"His rebel foes can I subdue and tame,"
6135,XXXIV,As thou shalt find before we end this fight;
6136,XXXIV,"And thy false heart cleft with this vengeful sword,"
6137,XXXIV,Shall feel the ire of thy forsaken Lord.”
6138,XXXIV,
6139,XXXV,XXXV
6140,XXXV,"When that great name Rambaldo’s ears did fill,"
6141,XXXV,"He shook for fear and looked pale for dread,"
6142,XXXV,"Yet proudly said, “Tancred, thy hap was ill"
6143,XXXV,"To wander hither where thou art but dead,"
6144,XXXV,"Where naught can help, thy courage, strength and skill;"
6145,XXXV,"To Godfrey will I send thy cursed head,"
6146,XXXV,"That he may see, how for Armida’s sake,"
6147,XXXV,Of him and of his Christ a scorn I make.”
6148,XXXV,
6149,XXXVI,XXXVI
6150,XXXVI,"This said, the day to sable night was turned,"
6151,XXXVI,"That scant one could another’s arms descry,"
6152,XXXVI,"But soon an hundred lamps and torches burned,"
6153,XXXVI,That cleared all the earth and all the sky;
6154,XXXVI,"The castle seemed a stage with lights adorned,"
6155,XXXVI,On which men play some pompous tragedy;
6156,XXXVI,"Within a terrace sat on high the queen,"
6157,XXXVI,"And heard, and saw, and kept herself unseen."
6158,XXXVI,
6159,XXXVII,XXXVII
6160,XXXVII,"The noble baron whet his courage hot,"
6161,XXXVII,And busked him boldly to the dreadful fight;
6162,XXXVII,"Upon his horse long while he tarried not,"
6163,XXXVII,"Because on foot he saw the Pagan knight,"
6164,XXXVII,"Who underneath his trusty shield was got,"
6165,XXXVII,"His sword was drawn, closed was his helmet bright,"
6166,XXXVII,"Gainst whom the prince marched on a stately pace,"
6167,XXXVII,"Wrath in his voice, rage in his eyes and face."
6168,XXXVII,
6169,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
6170,XXXVIII,"His foe, his furious charge not well abiding,"
6171,XXXVIII,"Traversed his ground, and stated here and there,"
6172,XXXVIII,"But he, though faint and weary both with riding,"
6173,XXXVIII,"Yet followed fast and still oppressed him near,"
6174,XXXVIII,"And on what side he felt Rambaldo sliding,"
6175,XXXVIII,On that his forces most employed were;
6176,XXXVIII,"Now at his helm, not at his hauberk bright,"
6177,XXXVIII,"He thundered blows, now at his face and sight."
6178,XXXVIII,
6179,XXXIX,XXXIX
6180,XXXIX,"Against those members battery chief he maketh,"
6181,XXXIX,Wherein man’s life keeps chiefest residence;
6182,XXXIX,"At his proud threats the Gascoign warrior quaketh,"
6183,XXXIX,"And uncouth fear appalled every sense,"
6184,XXXIX,"To nimble shifts the knight himself betaketh,"
6185,XXXIX,And skippeth here and there for his defence:
6186,XXXIX,"Now with his rage, now with his trusty blade,"
6187,XXXIX,Against his blows he good resistance made.
6188,XXXIX,
6189,XL,XL
6190,XL,"Yet no such quickness for defence he used,"
6191,XL,As did the prince to work him harm and scathe;
6192,XL,"His shield was cleft in twain, his helmet bruised,"
6193,XL,And in his blood his other arms did bathe;
6194,XL,"On him he heaped blows, with thrusts confused,"
6195,XL,And more or less each stroke annoyed him hath;
6196,XL,"He feared, and in his troubled bosom strove"
6197,XL,"Remorse of conscience, shame, disdain and love."
6198,XL,
6199,XLI,XLI
6200,XLI,"At last so careless foul despair him made,"
6201,XLI,"He meant to prove his fortune ill or good,"
6202,XLI,"His shield cast down, he took his helpless blade"
6203,XLI,"In both his hands, which yet had drawn no blood,"
6204,XLI,"And with such force upon the prince he laid,"
6205,XLI,"That neither plate nor mail the blow withstood,"
6206,XLI,"The wicked steel seized deep in his right side,"
6207,XLI,And with his streaming blood his bases dyed:
6208,XLI,
6209,XLII,XLII
6210,XLII,"Another stroke he lent him on the brow,"
6211,XLII,So great that loudly rung the sounding steel;
6212,XLII,"Yet pierced he not the helmet with the blow,"
6213,XLII,Although the owner twice or thrice did reel.
6214,XLII,"The prince, whose looks disdainful anger show,"
6215,XLII,"Now meant to use his puissance every deal,"
6216,XLII,"He shaked his head and crashed his teeth for ire,"
6217,XLII,"His lips breathed wrath, eyes sparkled shining fire."
6218,XLII,
6219,XLIII,XLIII
6220,XLIII,The Pagan wretch no longer could sustain
6221,XLIII,"The dreadful terror of his fierce aspect,"
6222,XLIII,Against the threatened blow he saw right plain
6223,XLIII,"No tempered armor could his life protect,"
6224,XLIII,"He leapt aside, the stroke fell down in vain,"
6225,XLIII,Against a pillar near a bridge erect.
6226,XLIII,"Thence flaming fire and thousand sparks outstart,"
6227,XLIII,And kill with fear the coward Pagan’s heart.
6228,XLIII,
6229,XLIV,XLIV
6230,XLIV,"Toward the bridge the fearful Paynim fled,"
6231,XLIV,"And in swift flight, his hope of life reposed;"
6232,XLIV,"Himself fast after Lord Tancredi sped,"
6233,XLIV,"And now in equal pace almost they closed,"
6234,XLIV,When all the burning lamps extinguished
6235,XLIV,"The shining fort his goodly splendor losed,"
6236,XLIV,And all those stars on heaven’s blue face that shone
6237,XLIV,"With Cynthia’s self, dispeared were and gone."
6238,XLIV,
6239,XLV,XLV
6240,XLV,"Amid those witchcrafts and that ugly shade,"
6241,XLV,"No further could the prince pursue the chase,"
6242,XLV,"Nothing he saw, yet forward still he made,"
6243,XLV,"With doubtful steps, and ill assured pace;"
6244,XLV,"At last his foot upon a threshold trad,"
6245,XLV,"And ere he wist, he entered had the place;"
6246,XLV,"With ghastly noise the door-leaves shut behind,"
6247,XLV,And closed him fast in prison dark and blind.
6248,XLV,
6249,XLVI,XLVI
6250,XLVI,"As in our seas in the Commachian Bay,"
6251,XLVI,"A silly fish, with streams enclosed, striveth,"
6252,XLVI,To shun the fury and avoid the sway
6253,XLVI,"Wherewith the current in that whirlpool driveth,"
6254,XLVI,"Yet seeketh all in vain, but finds no way"
6255,XLVI,"Out of that watery prison, where she diveth:"
6256,XLVI,"For with such force there be the tides in brought,"
6257,XLVI,"There entereth all that will, thence issueth naught:"
6258,XLVI,
6259,XLVII,XLVII
6260,XLVII,This prison so entrapped that valiant knight;
6261,XLVII,"Of which the gate was framed by subtle train,"
6262,XLVII,"To close without the help of human wight,"
6263,XLVII,So sure none could undo the leaves again;
6264,XLVII,"Against the doors he bended all his might,"
6265,XLVII,"But all his forces were employed in vain,"
6266,XLVII,"At last a voice gan to him loudly call,"
6267,XLVII,"“Yield thee,” quoth it, “thou art Armida’s thrall.”"
6268,XLVII,
6269,XLVIII,XLVIII
6270,XLVIII,“Within this dungeon buried shalt thou spend
6271,XLVIII,The res’due of thy woful days and years;”
6272,XLVIII,"The champion list not more with words contend,"
6273,XLVIII,"But in his heart kept close his griefs and fears,"
6274,XLVIII,"He blamed love, chance gan he reprehend,"
6275,XLVIII,And gainst enchantment huge complaints he rears.
6276,XLVIII,"“It were small loss,” softly he thus begun,"
6277,XLVIII,“To lose the brightness of the shining sun;
6278,XLVIII,
6279,XLIX,XLIX
6280,XLIX,"“But I, alas, the golden beam forego"
6281,XLIX,Of my far brighter sun; nor can I say
6282,XLIX,"If these poor eyes shall e’er be blessed so,"
6283,XLIX,As once again to view that shining ray:”
6284,XLIX,"Then thought he on his proud Circassian foe,"
6285,XLIX,"And said, “Ah!  how shall I perform that fray?"
6286,XLIX,"He, and the world with him, will Tancred blame,"
6287,XLIX,"This is my grief, my fault, mine endless shame.”"
6288,XLIX,
6289,L,L
6290,L,"While those high spirits of this champion good,"
6291,L,"With love and honor’s care are thus oppressed,"
6292,L,"While he torments himself, Argantes wood,"
6293,L,"Waxed weary of his bed and of his rest,"
6294,L,"Such hate of peace, and such desire of blood,"
6295,L,"Such thirst of glory, boiled in his breast;"
6296,L,"That though he scant could stir or stand upright,"
6297,L,Yet longed he for the appointed day to fight.
6298,L,
6299,LI,LI
6300,LI,"The night which that expected day forewent,"
6301,LI,"Scantly the Pagan closed his eyes to sleep,"
6302,LI,"He told how night her sliding hours spent,"
6303,LI,And rose ere springing day began to peep;
6304,LI,"He called for armor, which incontinent"
6305,LI,"Was brought by him that used the same to keep,"
6306,LI,"That harness rich old Aladine him gave,"
6307,LI,A worthy present for a champion brave.
6308,LI,
6309,LII,LII
6310,LII,"He donned them on, not long their riches eyed,"
6311,LII,"Nor did he aught with so great weight incline,"
6312,LII,"His wonted sword upon his thigh he tied,"
6313,LII,"The blade was old and tough, of temper fine."
6314,LII,"As when a comet far and wide descried,"
6315,LII,"In scorn of Phoebus midst bright heaven doth shine,"
6316,LII,And tidings sad of death and mischief brings
6317,LII,"To mighty lords, to monarchs, and to kings:"
6318,LII,
6319,LIII,LIII
6320,LIII,"So shone the Pagan in bright armor clad,"
6321,LIII,"And rolled his eyes great swollen with ire and blood,"
6322,LIII,"His dreadful gestures threatened horror sad,"
6323,LIII,And ugly death upon his forehead stood;
6324,LIII,Not one of all his squires the courage had
6325,LIII,"To approach their master in his angry mood,"
6326,LIII,"Above his head he shook his naked blade,"
6327,LIII,And gainst the subtle air vain battle made.
6328,LIII,
6329,LIV,LIV
6330,LIV,"“The Christian thief,” quoth he, “that was so bold"
6331,LIV,"To combat me in hard and single fight,"
6332,LIV,"Shall wounded fall inglorious on the mould,"
6333,LIV,"His locks with clods of blood and dust bedight,"
6334,LIV,And living shall with watery eyes behold
6335,LIV,"How from his back I tear his harness bright,"
6336,LIV,"Nor shall his dying words me so entreat,"
6337,LIV,But that I’ll give his flesh to dogs for meat.”
6338,LIV,
6339,LV,LV
6340,LV,"Like as a bull when, pricked with jealousy,"
6341,LV,"He spies the rival of his hot desire,"
6342,LV,"Through all the fields doth bellow, roar and cry,"
6343,LV,"And with his thundering voice augments his ire,"
6344,LV,"And threatening battle to the empty sky,"
6345,LV,"Tears with his horn each tree, plant, bush and brier,"
6346,LV,"And with his foot casts up the sand on height,"
6347,LV,Defying his strong foe to deadly fight:
6348,LV,
6349,LVI,LVI
6350,LVI,"Such was the Pagan’s fury, such his cry."
6351,LVI,"A herald called he then, and thus he spake;"
6352,LVI,"“Go to the camp, and in my name, defy"
6353,LVI,The man that combats for his Jesus’ sake;”
6354,LVI,"This said, upon his steed he mounted high,"
6355,LVI,"And with him did his noble prisoner take,"
6356,LVI,"The town he thus forsook, and on the green"
6357,LVI,"He ran, as mad or frantic he had been."
6358,LVI,
6359,LVII,LVII
6360,LVII,"A bugle small he winded loud and shrill,"
6361,LVII,"That made resound the fields and valleys near,"
6362,LVII,Louder than thunder from Olympus hill
6363,LVII,Seemed that dreadful blast to all that hear;
6364,LVII,"The Christian lords of prowess, strength and skill,"
6365,LVII,"Within the imperial tent assembled were,"
6366,LVII,The herald there in boasting terms defied
6367,LVII,"Tancredi first, and all that durst beside."
6368,LVII,
6369,LVIII,LVIII
6370,LVIII,"With sober chear Godfredo look’d about,"
6371,LVIII,And viewed at leisure every lord and knight;
6372,LVIII,"But yet for all his looks not one stepped out,"
6373,LVIII,"With courage bold, to undertake the fight:"
6374,LVIII,"Absent were all the Christian champions stout,"
6375,LVIII,No news of Tancred since his secret flight;
6376,LVIII,"Boemond far off, and banished from the crew"
6377,LVIII,Was that strong prince who proud Gernando slew:
6378,LVIII,
6379,LIX,LIX
6380,LIX,"And eke those ten which chosen were by lot,"
6381,LIX,"And all the worthies of the camp beside,"
6382,LIX,"After Armida false were followed hot,"
6383,LIX,When night were come their secret flight to hide;
6384,LIX,"The rest their hands and hearts that trusted not,"
6385,LIX,"Blushed for shame, yet silent still abide;"
6386,LIX,For none there was that sought to purchase fame
6387,LIX,"In so great peril, fear exiled shame."
6388,LIX,
6389,LX,LX
6390,LX,"The angry duke their fear discovered plain,"
6391,LX,"By their pale looks and silence from each part,"
6392,LX,"And as he moved was with just disdain,"
6393,LX,"These words he said, and from his seat upstart:"
6394,LX,“Unworthy life I judge that coward swain
6395,LX,"To hazard it even now that wants the heart,"
6396,LX,When this vile Pagan with his glorious boast
6397,LX,Dishonors and defies Christ’s sacred host.
6398,LX,
6399,LXI,LXI
6400,LXI,"“But let my camp sit still in peace and rest,"
6401,LXI,And my life’s hazard at their ease behold.
6402,LXI,Come bring me here my fairest arms and best;”
6403,LXI,And they were brought sooner than could be told.
6404,LXI,"But gentle Raymond in his aged breast,"
6405,LXI,"Who had mature advice, and counsel old,"
6406,LXI,Than whom in all the camp were none or few
6407,LXI,"Of greater might, before Godfredo drew,"
6408,LXI,
6409,LXII,LXII
6410,LXII,"And gravely said, “Ah, let it not betide,"
6411,LXII,On one man’s hand to venture all this host!
6412,LXII,"No private soldier thou, thou art our guide,"
6413,LXII,"If thou miscarry, all our hope were lost,"
6414,LXII,"By thee must Babel fall, and all her pride;"
6415,LXII,"Of our true faith thou art the prop and post,"
6416,LXII,"Rule with thy sceptre, conquer with thy word,"
6417,LXII,Let others combat make with spear and sword.
6418,LXII,
6419,LXIII,LXIII
6420,LXIII,"“Let me this Pagan’s glorious pride assuage,"
6421,LXIII,"These aged arms can yet their weapons use,"
6422,LXIII,"Let others shun Bellona’s dreadful rage,"
6423,LXIII,These silver locks shall not Raymondo  scuse:
6424,LXIII,"Oh that I were in prime of lusty age,"
6425,LXIII,"Like you that this adventure brave refuse,"
6426,LXIII,"And dare not once lift up your coward eyes,"
6427,LXIII,Gainst him that you and Christ himself defies!
6428,LXIII,
6429,LXIV,LXIV
6430,LXIV,“Or as I was when all the lords of fame
6431,LXIV,"And Germain princes great stood by to view,"
6432,LXIV,"In Conrad’s court, the second of that name,"
6433,LXIV,When Leopold in single fight I slew;
6434,LXIV,"A greater praise I reaped by the same,"
6435,LXIV,"So strong a foe in combat to subdue,"
6436,LXIV,Than he should do who all alone should chase
6437,LXIV,Or kill a thousand of these Pagans base.
6438,LXIV,
6439,LXV,LXV
6440,LXV,"“Within these arms, had I that strength again,"
6441,LXV,"This boasting Paynim had not lived till now,"
6442,LXV,Yet in this breast doth courage still remain;
6443,LXV,For age or years these members shall not bow;
6444,LXV,"And if I be in this encounter slain,"
6445,LXV,"Scotfree Argantes shall not scape, I vow;"
6446,LXV,"Give me mine arms, this battle shall with praise"
6447,LXV,"Augment mine honor, got in younger days.”"
6448,LXV,
6449,LXVI,LXVI
6450,LXVI,"The jolly baron old thus bravely spake,"
6451,LXVI,His words are spurs to virtue; every knight
6452,LXVI,"That seemed before to tremble and to quake,"
6453,LXVI,"Now talked bold, example hath such might;"
6454,LXVI,"Each one the battle fierce would undertake,"
6455,LXVI,Now strove they all who should begin the fight;
6456,LXVI,"Baldwin and Roger both, would combat fain,"
6457,LXVI,"Stephen, Guelpho, Gernier and the Gerrards twain;"
6458,LXVI,
6459,LXVII,LXVII
6460,LXVII,"And Pyrrhus, who with help of Boemond’s sword"
6461,LXVII,Proud Antioch by cunning sleight opprest;
6462,LXVII,"The battle eke with many a lowly word,"
6463,LXVII,"Ralph, Rosimond, and Eberard request,"
6464,LXVII,"A Scotch, an Irish, and an English lord,"
6465,LXVII,"Whose lands the sea divides far from the rest,"
6466,LXVII,"And for the fight did likewise humbly sue,"
6467,LXVII,"Edward and his Gildippes, lovers true."
6468,LXVII,
6469,LXVIII,LXVIII
6470,LXVIII,But Raymond more than all the rest doth sue
6471,LXVIII,"Upon that Pagan fierce to wreak his ire,"
6472,LXVIII,Now wants he naught of all his armors due
6473,LXVIII,Except his helm that shone like flaming fire.
6474,LXVIII,To whom Godfredo thus; “O mirror true
6475,LXVIII,Of antique worth!  thy courage doth inspire
6476,LXVIII,"New strength in us, of Mars in thee doth shine"
6477,LXVIII,"The art, the honor and the discipline."
6478,LXVIII,
6479,LXIX,LXIX
6480,LXIX,"“If ten like thee of valor and of age,"
6481,LXIX,"Among these legions I could haply find,"
6482,LXIX,"I should the best of Babel’s pride assuage,"
6483,LXIX,And spread our faith from Thule to furthest Inde;
6484,LXIX,"But now I pray thee calm thy valiant rage,"
6485,LXIX,"Reserve thyself till greater need us bind,"
6486,LXIX,"And let the rest each one write down his name,"
6487,LXIX,"And see whom Fortune chooseth to this game,—"
6488,LXIX,
6489,LXX,LXX
6490,LXX,"“Or rather see whom God’s high judgement taketh,"
6491,LXX,"To whom is chance, and fate, and fortune slave.”"
6492,LXX,"Raymond his earnest suit not yet forsaketh,"
6493,LXX,"His name writ with the residue would he have,"
6494,LXX,Godfrey himself in his bright helmet shaketh
6495,LXX,"The scrolls, with names of all the champions brave:"
6496,LXX,"They drew, and read the first whereon they hit,"
6497,LXX,"Wherein was “Raymond, Earl of Tholouse,” writ."
6498,LXX,
6499,LXXI,LXXI
6500,LXXI,His name with joy and mighty shouts they bless;
6501,LXXI,"The rest allow his choice, and fortune praise,"
6502,LXXI,New vigor blushed through those looks of his;
6503,LXXI,"It seemed he now resumed his youthful days,"
6504,LXXI,"Like to a snake whose slough new changed is,"
6505,LXXI,That shines like gold against the sunny rays:
6506,LXXI,"But Godfrey most approved his fortune high,"
6507,LXXI,"And wished him honor, conquest, victory."
6508,LXXI,
6509,LXXII,LXXII
6510,LXXII,"Then from his side he took his noble brand,"
6511,LXXII,"And giving it to Raymond, thus he spake:"
6512,LXXII,"“This is the sword wherewith in Saxon land,"
6513,LXXII,"The great Rubello battle used to make,"
6514,LXXII,"From him I took it, fighting hand to hand,"
6515,LXXII,"And took his life with it, and many a lake"
6516,LXXII,"Of blood with it I have shed since that day,"
6517,LXXII,With thee God grant it proves as happy may.”
6518,LXXII,
6519,LXXIII,LXXIII
6520,LXXIII,"Of these delays meanwhile impatient,"
6521,LXXIII,"Argantes threateneth loud and sternly cries,"
6522,LXXIII,“O glorious people of the Occident!
6523,LXXIII,Behold him here that all your host defies:
6524,LXXIII,"Why comes not Tancred, whose great hardiment,"
6525,LXXIII,With you is prized so dear?  Pardie he lies
6526,LXXIII,"Still on his pillow, and presumes the night"
6527,LXXIII,Again may shield him from my power and might.
6528,LXXIII,
6529,LXXIV,LXXIV
6530,LXXIV,"“Why then some other come, by band and band,"
6531,LXXIV,"Come all, come forth on horseback, come on foot,"
6532,LXXIV,"If not one man dares combat hand to hand,"
6533,LXXIV,In all the thousands of so great a rout:
6534,LXXIV,"See where the tomb of Mary’s Son doth stand,"
6535,LXXIV,"March thither, warriors hold, what makes you doubt?"
6536,LXXIV,"Why run you not, there for your sins to weep"
6537,LXXIV,Or to what greater need these forces keep?”
6538,LXXIV,
6539,LXXV,LXXV
6540,LXXV,Thus scorned by that heathen Saracine
6541,LXXV,Were all the soldiers of Christ’s sacred name:
6542,LXXV,"Raymond, while others at his words repine,"
6543,LXXV,"Burst forth in rage, he could not bear this shame:"
6544,LXXV,For fire of courage brighter far doth shine
6545,LXXV,If challenges and threats augment the same;
6546,LXXV,"So that, upon his steed he mounted light,"
6547,LXXV,Which Aquilino for his swiftness hight.
6548,LXXV,
6549,LXXVI,LXXVI
6550,LXXVI,This jennet was by Tagus bred; for oft
6551,LXXVI,"The breeder of these beasts to war assigned,"
6552,LXXVI,When first on trees burgeon the blossoms soft
6553,LXXVI,"Pricked forward with the sting of fertile kind,"
6554,LXXVI,Against the air casts up her head aloft
6555,LXXVI,And gathereth seed so from the fruitful wind
6556,LXXVI,"And thus conceiving of the gentle blast,"
6557,LXXVI,"A wonder strange and rare, she foals at last."
6558,LXXVI,
6559,LXXVII,LXXVII
6560,LXXVII,"And had you seen the beast, you would have said"
6561,LXXVII,The light and subtile wind his father was;
6562,LXXVII,For if his course upon the sands he made
6563,LXXVII,No sign was left what way the beast did pass;
6564,LXXVII,"Or if he menaged were, or if he played,"
6565,LXXVII,He scantly bended down the tender grass:
6566,LXXVII,"Thus mounted rode the Earl, and as he went,"
6567,LXXVII,"Thus prayed, to Heaven his zealous looks upbent."

6573,LXXVIII,Slain by a faithful child of tender age;
6574,LXXVIII,"Like grace, O Lord, like mercy now extend!"
6575,LXXVIII,"Let me this vile blasphemous pride assuage,"
6576,LXXVIII,"That all the world may to thy glory know,"
6577,LXXVIII,Old men and babes thy foes can overthrow!”
6578,LXXVIII,
6579,LXXIX,LXXIX

6583,LXXIX,"In whose sweet grace is life, death in his wrath,"
6584,LXXIX,"Among his armies bright and legions clear,"
6585,LXXIX,"The Lord an angel good selected hath,"
6586,LXXIX,"To whom the charge was given to guard the knight,"
6587,LXXIX,And keep him safe from that fierce Pagan’s might.

6590,LXXX,"The angel good, appointed for the guard"
6591,LXXX,"Of noble Raymond from his tender eild,"

6593,LXXX,"When spear and sword he able was to wield,"
6594,LXXX,"Now when his great Creator’s will he heard,"
6595,LXXX,"That in this fight he should him chiefly shield,"
6596,LXXX,"Up to a tower set on a rock he flies,"
6597,LXXX,Where all the heavenly arms and weapons lies:
6598,LXXX,
6599,LXXXI,LXXXI
6600,LXXXI,There stands the lance wherewith great Michael slew
6601,LXXXI,"The aged dragon in a bloody fight,"
6602,LXXXI,"There are the dreadful thunders forged new,"
6603,LXXXI,With storms and plagues that on poor sinners light;
6604,LXXXI,The massy trident mayest thou pendant view
6605,LXXXI,"There on a golden pin hung up on height,"
6606,LXXXI,"Wherewith sometimes he smites this solid land,"
6607,LXXXI,And throws down towns and towers thereon which stand.

6609,LXXXII,LXXXII
6610,LXXXII,Among the blessed weapons there which stands
6611,LXXXII,"Upon a diamond shield his looks he bended,"
6612,LXXXII,"So great that it might cover all the lands,"
6613,LXXXII,Twixt Caucasus and Atlas hills extended;
6614,LXXXII,"With it the lord’s dear flocks and faithful bands,"
6615,LXXXII,"The holy kings and cities are defended,"
6616,LXXXII,"The sacred angel took this target sheen,"
6617,LXXXII,And by the Christian champion stood unseen.
6618,LXXXII,
6619,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
6620,LXXXIII,"But now the walls and turrets round about,"
6621,LXXXIII,Both young and old with many thousands fill;
6622,LXXXIII,"The king Clorinda sent and her brave rout,"
6623,LXXXIII,"To keep the field, she stayed upon the hill:"
6624,LXXXIII,Godfrey likewise some Christian bands sent out
6625,LXXXIII,"Which armed, and ranked in good array stood still,"
6626,LXXXIII,And to their champions empty let remain
6627,LXXXIII,Twixt either troop a large and spacious plain.
6628,LXXXIII,
6629,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
6630,LXXXIV,"Argantes looked for Tancredi bold,"
6631,LXXXIV,"But saw an uncouth foe at last appear,"
6632,LXXXIV,"Raymond rode on, and what he asked him, told,"
6633,LXXXIV,"Better by chance, “Tancred is now elsewhere,"
6634,LXXXIV,"Yet glory not of that, myself behold"
6635,LXXXIV,"Am come prepared, and bid thee battle here,"
6636,LXXXIV,"And in his place, or for myself to fight,"
6637,LXXXIV,"Lo, here I am, who scorn thy heathenish might.”"
6638,LXXXIV,
6639,LXXXV,LXXXV
6640,LXXXV,"The Pagan cast a scornful smile and said,"
6641,LXXXV,"“But where is Tancred, is he still in bed?"
6642,LXXXV,His looks late seemed to make high heaven afraid;
6643,LXXXV,But now for dread he is or dead or fled;
6644,LXXXV,But whe’er earth’s centre or the deep sea made
6645,LXXXV,"His lurking hole, it should not save his head.”"
6646,LXXXV,"“Thou liest,” he says, “to say so brave a knight"
6647,LXXXV,"Is fled from thee, who thee exceeds in might.”"
6648,LXXXV,
6649,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
6650,LXXXVI,"The angry Pagan said, “I have not spilt"
6651,LXXXVI,"My labor then, if thou his place supply,"
6652,LXXXVI,"Go take the field, and let’s see how thou wilt"
6653,LXXXVI,Maintain thy foolish words and that brave lie;”
6654,LXXXVI,"Thus parleyed they to meet in equal tilt,"
6655,LXXXVI,"Each took his aim at other’s helm on high,"
6656,LXXXVI,"Even in the fight his foe good Raymond hit,"
6657,LXXXVI,"But shaked him not, he did so firmly sit."
6658,LXXXVI,
6659,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
6660,LXXXVII,"The fierce Circassian missed of his blow,"
6661,LXXXVII,"A thing which seld befell the man before,"
6662,LXXXVII,"The angel, by unseen, his force did know,"
6663,LXXXVII,"And far awry the poignant weapon bore,"
6664,LXXXVII,"He burst his lance against the sand below,"
6665,LXXXVII,"And bit his lips for rage, and cursed and swore,"
6666,LXXXVII,"Against his foe returned he swift as wind,"
6667,LXXXVII,Half mad in arms a second match to find.
6668,LXXXVII,
6669,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
6670,LXXXVIII,"Like to a ram that butts with horned head,"
6671,LXXXVIII,So spurred he forth his horse with desperate race:
6672,LXXXVIII,"Raymond at his right hand let slide his steed,"
6673,LXXXVIII,And as he passed struck at the Pagan’s face;
6674,LXXXVIII,"He turned again, the earl was nothing dread,"
6675,LXXXVIII,"Yet stept aside, and to his rage gave place,"
6676,LXXXVIII,"And on his helm with all his strength gan smite,"
6677,LXXXVIII,Which was so hard his courtlax could not bite.
6678,LXXXVIII,
6679,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
6680,LXXXIX,The Saracen employed his art and force
6681,LXXXIX,"To grip his foe within his mighty arms,"
6682,LXXXIX,"But he avoided nimbly with his horse,"
6683,LXXXIX,"He was no prentice in those fierce alarms,"
6684,LXXXIX,"About him made he many a winding course,"
6685,LXXXIX,"No strength, nor sleight the subtle warrior harms,"
6686,LXXXIX,"His nimble steed obeyed his ready hand,"
6687,LXXXIX,And where he stept no print left in the sand.
6688,LXXXIX,
6689,XC,XC
6690,XC,"As when a captain doth besiege some hold,"
6691,XC,"Set in a marsh or high up on a hill,"
6692,XC,"And trieth ways and wiles a thousandfold,"
6693,XC,To bring the piece subjected to his will;
6694,XC,So fared the County with the Pagan bold;
6695,XC,"And when he did his head and breast none ill,"
6696,XC,"His weaker parts he wisely gan assail,"
6697,XC,And entrance searched oft ’twixt mail and mail.
6698,XC,
6699,XCI,XCI
6700,XCI,"At last he hit him on a place or twain,"
6701,XCI,"That on his arms the red blood trickled down,"
6702,XCI,"And yet himself untouched did remain,"
6703,XCI,"No nail was broke, no plume cut from his crown;"
6704,XCI,"Argantes raging spent his strength in vain,"
6705,XCI,"Waste were his strokes, his thrusts were idle thrown,"
6706,XCI,"Yet pressed he on, and doubled still his blows,"
6707,XCI,And where he hits he neither cares nor knows.
6708,XCI,
6709,XCII,XCII
6710,XCII,Among a thousand blows the Saracine
6711,XCII,"At last struck one, when Raymond was so near,"
6712,XCII,That not the swiftness of his Aquiline
6713,XCII,Could his dear lord from that huge danger bear:
6714,XCII,"But lo, at hand unseen was help divine,"
6715,XCII,"Which saves when worldly comforts none appear,"
6716,XCII,"The angel on his targe received that stroke,"
6717,XCII,And on that shield Argantes’ sword was broke.
6718,XCII,
6719,XCIII,XCIII
6720,XCIII,"The sword was broke, therein no wonder lies"
6721,XCIII,If earthly tempered metal could not hold
6722,XCIII,"Against that target forged above the skies,"
6723,XCIII,Down fell the blade in pieces on the mould;
6724,XCIII,"The proud Circassian scant believed his eyes,"
6725,XCIII,"Though naught were left him but the hilts of gold,"
6726,XCIII,"And full of thoughts amazed awhile he stood,"
6727,XCIII,Wondering the Christian’s armor was so good.
6728,XCIII,
6729,XCIV,XCIV
6730,XCIV,"The brittle web of that rich sword he thought,"
6731,XCIV,Was broke through hardness of the County’s shield;
6732,XCIV,"And so thought Raymond, who discovered naught"
6733,XCIV,What succor Heaven did for his safety yield:
6734,XCIV,But when he saw the man gainst whom he fought
6735,XCIV,"Unweaponed, still stood he in the field;"
6736,XCIV,"His noble heart esteemed the glory light,"
6737,XCIV,At such advantage if he slew the knight.
6738,XCIV,
6739,XCV,XCV
6740,XCV,"“Go fetch,” he would have said, “another blade,”"
6741,XCV,"When in his heart a better thought arose,"
6742,XCV,"How for Christ’s glory he was champion made,"
6743,XCV,"How Godfrey had him to this combat chose,"
6744,XCV,The army’s honor on his shoulder laid
6745,XCV,To hazards new he list not that expose;
6746,XCV,"While thus his thoughts debated on the case,"
6747,XCV,The hilts Argantes hurled at his face.
6748,XCV,
6749,XCVI,XCVI
6750,XCVI,"And forward spurred his mounture fierce withal,"
6751,XCVI,"Within his arms longing his foe to strain,"
6752,XCVI,"Upon whose helm the heavy blow did fall,"
6753,XCVI,And bent well-nigh the metal to his brain:
6754,XCVI,"But he, whose courage was heroical,"
6755,XCVI,"Leapt by, and makes the Pagan’s onset vain,"
6756,XCVI,"And wounds his hand, which he outstretched saw,"
6757,XCVI,"Fiercer than eagles’ talon, lions’ paw."
6758,XCVI,
6759,XCVII,XCVII
6760,XCVII,"Now here, now there, on every side he rode,"
6761,XCVII,"With nimble speed, and spurred now out, now in,"
6762,XCVII,And as he went and came still laid on load
6763,XCVII,Where Lord Argantes’ arms were weak and thin;
6764,XCVII,"All that huge force which in his arms abode,"
6765,XCVII,"His wrath, his ire, his great desire to win,"
6766,XCVII,"Against his foe together all he bent,"
6767,XCVII,And heaven and fortune furthered his intent.
6768,XCVII,
6769,XCVIII,XCVIII
6770,XCVIII,"But he, whose courage for no peril fails,"
6771,XCVIII,"Well armed, and better hearted, scorns his power."
6772,XCVIII,"Like a tall ship when spent are all her sails,"
6773,XCVIII,"Which still resists the rage of storm and shower,"
6774,XCVIII,"Whose mighty ribs fast bound with bands and nails,"
6775,XCVIII,"Withstand fierce Neptune’s wrath, for many an hour,"
6776,XCVIII,"And yields not up her bruised keel to winds,"
6777,XCVIII,In whose stern blast no ruth nor grace she finds:
6778,XCVIII,
6779,XCIX,XCIX
6780,XCIX,"Argantes such thy present danger was,"
6781,XCIX,"When Satan stirred to aid thee at thy need,"
6782,XCIX,"In human shape he forged an airy mass,"
6783,XCIX,And made the shade a body seem indeed;
6784,XCIX,"Well might the spirit for Clorinda pass,"
6785,XCIX,"Like her it was, in armor and in weed,"
6786,XCIX,"In stature, beauty, countenance and face,"
6787,XCIX,"In looks, in speech, in gesture, and in pace."
6788,XCIX,
6789,C,C
6790,C,"And for the spirit should seem the same indeed,"
6791,C,"From where she was whose show and shape it had,"
6792,C,"Toward the wall it rode with feigned speed,"
6793,C,"Where stood the people all dismayed and sad,"
6794,C,"To see their knight of help have so great need,"
6795,C,And yet the law of arms all help forbad.
6796,C,There in a turret sat a soldier stout
6797,C,"To watch, and at a loop-hole peeped out;"

6799,CI,CI
6800,CI,"The spirit spake to him, called Oradine,"
6801,CI,"The noblest archer then that handled bow,"
6802,CI,"“O Oradine,” quoth she, “who straight as line"
6803,CI,"Can’st shoot, and hit each mark set high or low,"
6804,CI,"If yonder knight, alas!  be slain in fine,"
6805,CI,"As likest is, great ruth it were you know,"
6806,CI,"And greater shame, if his victorious foe"

6812,CII,I promise thee thy sovereign shall not slip
6813,CII,To give thee large rewards for such a good;”
6814,CII,Thus said the spirit; the man did laugh and skip
6815,CII,"For hope of future gain, nor longer stood,"
6816,CII,"But from his quiver huge a shaft he hent,"
6817,CII,"And set it in his mighty bow new bent,"
6818,CII,
6819,CIII,CIII
6820,CIII,"Twanged the string, out flew the quarrel long,"

6823,CIII,"Wherewith his precious girdle fastened was,"
6824,CIII,"It bruised them and pierced his hauberk strong,"
6825,CIII,Some little blood down trickled on the grass;
6826,CIII,"Light was the wound; the angel by unseen,"
6827,CIII,The sharp head blunted of the weapon keen.

6834,CIV,"Godfrey, whose careful eyes from his beloved"
6835,CIV,"Were never turned, saw and marked the same,"

6838,CIV,

6844,CV,"From either side a squadron brave out flies,"

6847,CV,"Their shining arms, and far more shining sun."
6848,CV,
6849,CVI,CVI
6850,CVI,"Of breaking spears, of ringing helm and shield,"

6893,CX,That many a Paynim bold there made his end:
6894,CX,"The Turks too weak seemed to sustain his might,"
6895,CX,"And could not from his power their lives defend,"
6896,CX,"Their ensigns rent, and broke was their array,"
6897,CX,And men and horse on heaps together lay.
6898,CX,
6899,CXI,CXI
6900,CXI,"O’erthrown likewise away the right wing ran,"
6901,CXI,"Nor was there one again that turned his face,"
6902,CXI,"Save bold Argantes, else fled every man,"
6903,CXI,"Fear drove them thence on heaps, with headlong chase:"
6904,CXI,"He stayed alone, and battle new began,"
6905,CXI,"Five hundred men, weaponed with sword and mace,"
6906,CXI,"So great resistance never could have made,"
6907,CXI,As did Argantes with his single blade:
6908,CXI,
6909,CXII,CXII
6910,CXII,"The strokes of swords and thrusts of many a spear,"
6911,CXII,"The shock of many a joust he long sustained,"
6912,CXII,"He seemed of strength enough this charge to bear,"
6913,CXII,"And time to strike, now here, now there, he gained"
6914,CXII,"His armors broke, his members bruised were,"
6915,CXII,"He sweat and bled, yet courage still he feigned;"
6916,CXII,"But now his foes upon him pressed so fast,"
6917,CXII,That with their weight they bore him back at last.
6918,CXII,
6919,CXIII,CXIII
6920,CXIII,"His back against this storm at length he turned,"
6921,CXIII,"Whose headlong fury bore him backward still,"
6922,CXIII,"Not like to one that fled, but one that mourned"
6923,CXIII,"Because he did his foes no greater ill,"
6924,CXIII,"His threatening eyes like flaming torches burned,"
6925,CXIII,"His courage thirsted yet more blood to spill,"
6926,CXIII,"And every way and every mean he sought,"
6927,CXIII,"To stay his flying mates, but all for naught."
6928,CXIII,
6929,CXIV,CXIV
6930,CXIV,"This good he did, while thus he played his part,"
6931,CXIV,"His bands and troops at ease, and safe, retired;"
6932,CXIV,"Yet coward dread lacks order, fear wants art,"
6933,CXIV,"Deaf to attend, commanded or desired."
6934,CXIV,"But Godfrey that perceived in his wise heart,"
6935,CXIV,"How his bold knights to victory aspired,"
6936,CXIV,"Fresh soldiers sent, to make more quick pursuit,"
6937,CXIV,And help to gather conquest’s precious fruit.
6938,CXIV,
6939,CXV,CXV
6940,CXV,"But this, alas, was not the appointed day,"
6941,CXV,Set down by Heaven to end this mortal war:
6942,CXV,The western lords this time had borne away
6943,CXV,"The prize, for which they travelled had so far,"
6944,CXV,"Had not the devils, that saw the sure decay"
6945,CXV,"Of their false kingdom by this bloody war,"
6946,CXV,"At once made heaven and earth with darkness blind,"
6947,CXV,"And stirred up tempests, storms, and blustering wind."
6948,CXV,
6949,CXVI,CXVI
6950,CXVI,"Heaven’s glorious lamp, wrapped in an ugly veil"
6951,CXVI,"Of shadows dark, was hid from mortal eye,"
6952,CXVI,And hell’s grim blackness did bright skies assail;
6953,CXVI,"On every side the fiery lightnings fly,"
6954,CXVI,"The thunders roar, the streaming rain and hail"
6955,CXVI,Pour down and make that sea which erst was dry.
6956,CXVI,"The tempests rend the oaks and cedars brake,"
6957,CXVI,And make not trees but rocks and mountains shake.
6958,CXVI,
6959,CXVII,CXVII
6960,CXVII,"The rain, the lightning, and the raging wind,"
6961,CXVII,"Beat in the Frenchmen’s eyes with hideous force,"
6962,CXVII,"The soldiers stayed amazed in heart and mind,"
6963,CXVII,The terror such that stopped both man and horse.
6964,CXVII,"Surprised with this evil no way they find,"
6965,CXVII,"Whither for succor to direct their course,"
6966,CXVII,"But wise Clorinda soon the advantage spied,"
6967,CXVII,And spurring forth thus to her soldiers cried:
6968,CXVII,
6969,CXVIII,CXVIII
6970,CXVIII,"“You hardy men at arms behold,” quoth she,"
6971,CXVIII,"“How Heaven, how Justice in our aid doth fight,"
6972,CXVIII,"Our visages are from this tempest free,"
6973,CXVIII,"Our hands at will may wield our weapons bright,"
6974,CXVIII,The fury of this friendly storm you see
6975,CXVIII,"Upon the foreheads of our foes doth light,"
6976,CXVIII,"And blinds their eyes, then let us take the tide,"
6977,CXVIII,"Come, follow me, good fortune be our guide.”"
6978,CXVIII,
6979,CXIX,CXIX
6980,CXIX,"This said, against her foes on rode the dame,"
6981,CXIX,And turned their backs against the wind and rain;
6982,CXIX,"Upon the French with furious rage she came,"
6983,CXIX,And scorned those idle blows they struck in vain;
6984,CXIX,"Argantes at the instant did the same,"
6985,CXIX,"And them who chased him now chased again,"
6986,CXIX,Naught but his fearful back each Christian shows
6987,CXIX,"Against the tempest, and against their blows."
6988,CXIX,
6989,CXX,CXX
6990,CXX,"The cruel hail, and deadly wounding blade,"
6991,CXX,"Upon their shoulders smote them as they fled,"
6992,CXX,"The blood new spilt while thus they slaughter made,"
6993,CXX,"The water fallen from skies had dyed red,"
6994,CXX,"Among the murdered bodies Pyrrhus laid,"
6995,CXX,"And valiant Raiphe his heart blood there out bled,"
6996,CXX,"The first subdued by strong Argantes’ might,"
6997,CXX,The second conquered by that virgin knight.
6998,CXX,
6999,CXXI,CXXI
7000,CXXI,"Thus fled the French, and then pursued in chase"
7001,CXXI,The wicked sprites and all the Syrian train:
7002,CXXI,But gainst their force and gainst their fell menace
7003,CXXI,"Of hail and wind, of tempest and of rain,"
7004,CXXI,"Godfrey alone turned his audacious face,"
7005,CXXI,"Blaming his barons for their fear so vain,"
7006,CXXI,"Himself the camp gate boldly stood to keep,"
7007,CXXI,And saved his men within his trenches deep.
7008,CXXI,
7009,CXXII,CXXII
7010,CXXII,"And twice upon Argantes proud he flew,"
7011,CXXII,"And beat him backward, maugre all his might,"
7012,CXXII,"And twice his thirsty sword he did imbrue,"
7013,CXXII,In Pagan’s blood where thickest was the fight;
7014,CXXII,"At last himself with all his folk withdrew,"
7015,CXXII,"And that day’s conquest gave the virgin bright,"
7016,CXXII,"Which got, she home retired and all her men,"
7017,CXXII,And thus she chased this lion to his den.
7018,CXXII,
7019,CXXIII,CXXIII
7020,CXXIII,Yet ceased not the fury and the ire
7021,CXXIII,"Of these huge storms, of wind, of rain and hail,"
7022,CXXIII,"Now was it dark, now shone the lightning fire,"
7023,CXXIII,"The wind and water every place assail,"
7024,CXXIII,"No bank was safe, no rampire left entire,"
7025,CXXIII,"No tent could stand, when beam and cordage fail,"
7026,CXXIII,"Wind, thunder, rain, all gave a dreadful sound,"
7027,CXXIII,And with that music deafed the trembling ground.

7190,XV,"Brethren, this camp will shortly be, I guess,"

7209,XVII,"With kindled brand of courage bold and stout,"
7210,XVII,"When lo, the Pagans to assault us came,"
7211,XVII,"And with huge numbers hemmed us round about,"
7212,XVII,"A forest thick of spears about us grew,"
7213,XVII,And over us a cloud of arrows flew:

7215,XVIII,XVIII
7216,XVIII,"“Uneven the fight, unequal was the fray,"
7217,XVIII,"Our enemies were twenty men to one,"

7219,XVIII,"Unseen, where naught but glistering weapons shone:"
7220,XVIII,"The number of the dead could no man say,"
7221,XVIII,"So was the place with darkness overgone,"
7222,XVIII,"The night her mantle black upon its spreads,"
7223,XVIII,Hiding our losses and our valiant deeds.

7225,XIX,XIX
7226,XIX,"“But hardy Sweno midst the other train,"
7227,XIX,"By his great acts was well descried I wot,"
7228,XIX,"No darkness could his valor’s daylight stain,"
7229,XIX,Such wondrous blows on every side he smote;
7230,XIX,"A stream of blood, a bank of bodies slain,"
7231,XIX,"About him made a bulwark, and a mote,"
7232,XIX,"And when soe’er he turned his fatal brand,"
7233,XIX,Dread in his looks and death sate in his hand.

7235,XX,XX
7236,XX,"“Thus fought we till the morning bright appeared,"

7246,XXI,“Of thousands twain an hundred scant survived.
7247,XXI,"When Sweno murdered saw each valiant knight,"
7248,XXI,I know not if his heart in sunder rived
7249,XXI,For dear compassion of that woful sight;
7250,XXI,"He showed no change, but said: ‘Since so deprived"
7251,XXI,"We are of all our friends by chance of fight,"
7252,XXI,"Come follow them, the path to heaven their blood"
7253,XXI,"Marks out, now angels made, of martyrs good.’"
7254,XXI,
7255,XXII,XXII
7256,XXII,"“This said, and glad I think of death at hand,"
7257,XXII,"The signs of heavenly joy shone through his eyes,"
7258,XXII,"Of Saracens against a mighty band,"
7259,XXII,With fearless heart and constant breast he flies;
7260,XXII,No steel could shield them from his cutting brand
7261,XXII,"But whom he hits without recure he dies,"
7262,XXII,He never struck but felled or killed his foe
7263,XXII,And wounded was himself from top to toe.

7273,XXIII,"After long fight, at last Prince Sweno slew."
7274,XXIII,
7275,XXIV,XXIV
7276,XXIV,"“Ah, heavy chance!  Down fell the valiant youth,"
7277,XXIV,Nor mongst us all did one so strong appear
7278,XXIV,"As to revenge his death: that this is truth,"
7279,XXIV,"By his dear blood and noble bones I swear,"
7280,XXIV,"That of my life I had not care nor ruth,"
7281,XXIV,"No wounds I shunned, no blows I would off bear,"

7290,XXV,"But when I opened first mine eyes again,"
7291,XXV,"Night’s curtain black upon the earth was spread,"
7292,XXV,"And through the darkness to my feeble sight,"
7293,XXV,Appeared the twinkling of a slender light.

7295,XXVI,XXVI
7296,XXVI,“Not so much force or judgement in me lies
7297,XXVI,"As to discern things seen and not mistake,"

7299,XXVI,"By turns, now half asleep, now half awake;"
7300,XXVI,"My body eke another torment tries,"
7301,XXVI,"My wounds began to smart, my hurts to ache;"

7305,XXVII,XXVII
7306,XXVII,"“But still the light approached near and near,"
7307,XXVII,"And with the same a whispering murmur run,"
7308,XXVII,"Till at my side arrived both they were,"
7309,XXVII,When I to spread my feeble eyes begun:
7310,XXVII,"Two men behold in vestures long appear,"
7311,XXVII,"With each a lamp in hand, who said, ‘O son"
7312,XXVII,"In that dear Lord who helps his servants, trust,"
7313,XXVII,"Who ere they ask, grants all things to the just.’"
7314,XXVII,
7315,XXVIII,XXVIII
7316,XXVIII,"“This said, each one his sacred blessings flings"
7317,XXVIII,"Upon my corse, with broad our-stretched hand,"
7318,XXVIII,"And mumbled hymns and psalms and holy things,"
7319,XXVIII,Which I could neither hear nor understand;
7320,XXVIII,"‘Arise,’ quoth they, with that as I had wings,"
7321,XXVIII,All whole and sound I leaped up from the land.
7322,XXVIII,"Oh miracle, sweet, gentle, strange and true!"
7323,XXVIII,"My limbs new strength received, and vigor new."
7324,XXVIII,
7325,XXIX,XXIX
7326,XXIX,“I gazed on them like one whose heart denieth
7327,XXIX,"To think that done, he sees so strangely wrought;"

7749,LXXI,The nest of treason false and guile enorm.”
7750,LXXI,Thus spake the angry knight with headlong course;
7751,LXXI,"The rest him followed with a furious storm,"
7752,LXXI,"“Arm, arm.” they cried, to arms the soldiers ran."

7758,LXXII,"Folly, disdain, madness, strife, rancor, ire,"
7759,LXXII,"Thirst to shed blood, in every breast increased,"
7760,LXXII,"This ill spread far, and till it set on fire"
7761,LXXII,"With rage the Italian lodgings, never ceased,"
7762,LXXII,"From thence unto the Switzers’ camp it went,"
7763,LXXII,And last infected every English tent.
7764,LXXII,
7765,LXXIII,LXXIII
7766,LXXIII,"Not public loss of their beloved knight,"
7767,LXXIII,"Alone stirred up their rage and wrath untamed,"

7769,LXXIII,"The ire still nourished, and still inflamed,"
7770,LXXIII,"Awaked was each former cause of spite,"
7771,LXXIII,"The Frenchmen cruel and unjust they named,"

7773,LXXIII,"Hate seld kept close, and oft unwisely shown:"

7779,LXXIV,"Part of the broth and of the scum is cast,"

7781,LXXIV,"In whom of wisdom yet remained some taste,"
7782,LXXIV,"Camillo, William, Tancred were away,"
7783,LXXIV,And all whose greatness might their madness stay.
7784,LXXIV,
7785,LXXV,LXXV

7787,LXXV,"These furious people, all on heaps confused,"
7788,LXXV,"The roaring trumpets battle gan to threat,"
7789,LXXV,"As it in time of mortal war is used,"
7790,LXXV,"The messengers ran to Godfredo great,"
7791,LXXV,"And bade him arm, while on this noise he mused,"

7800,LXXVI,"Illumine their dark souls with light divine,"
7801,LXXVI,"Repress their rage, by hellish fury bred,"
7802,LXXVI,The innocency of my guiltless mind
7803,LXXVI,"Thou knowest, and make these know, with fury blind.”"

7807,LXXVII,"A sacred heat from heaven above distilled,"
7808,LXXVII,A heat in man that courage could constrain
7809,LXXVII,That his brave look with awful boldness filled.
7810,LXXVII,Well guarded forth he went to meet the train
7811,LXXVII,Of those that would revenge Rinaldo killed;
7812,LXXVII,"And though their threats he heard, and saw them bent"
7813,LXXVII,"To arms on every side, yet on he went."

7819,LXXVIII,Wherein a lamp of majesty bright shone;

7830,LXXIX,Of Godfrey’s falsehood who can witness bear?

8275,XXXVII,"That may provoke thine ire, thy wrath and spite?”"
8276,XXXVII,"With that he struck, his anger great to wreak,"
8277,XXXVII,"A blow, that pierced the mail and metal bright,"

8287,XXXVIII,"Wretched Latinus at that issue large,"

8296,XXXIX,"So Latine fell, and with him felled he"

8602,LXX,"Upon his neck light that unhappy blow,"
8603,LXX,"And cut the sinews and the throat in twain,"
8604,LXX,"The head fell down upon the earth below,"
8605,LXX,And soiled with dust the visage on the plain;
8606,LXX,"The headless trunk, a woful thing to know,"
8607,LXX,Still in the saddle seated did remain;
8608,LXX,"Until his steed, that felt the reins at large,"
8609,LXX,With leaps and flings that burden did discharge.

8611,LXXI,LXXI
8612,LXXI,While thus this fair and fierce Bellona slew
8613,LXXI,"The western lords, and put their troops to flight,"
8614,LXXI,"Gildippes raged mongst the Pagan crew,"
8615,LXXI,And low in dust laid many a worthy knight:
8616,LXXI,"Like was their sex, their beauty and their hue,"
8617,LXXI,"Like was their youth, their courage and their might;"
8618,LXXI,Yet fortune would they should the battle try
8619,LXXI,"Of mightier foes, for both were framed to die."
8620,LXXI,
8621,LXXII,LXXII
8622,LXXII,"Yet wished they oft, and strove in vain to meet,"
8623,LXXII,"So great betwixt them was the press and throng,"
8624,LXXII,But hardy Guelpho gainst Clorinda sweet
8625,LXXII,"Ventured his sword to work her harm and wrong,"
8626,LXXII,"And with a cutting blow so did her greet,"
8627,LXXII,That from her side the blood streamed down along;
8628,LXXII,"But with a thrust an answer sharp she made,"
8629,LXXII,And ’twixt his ribs colored somedeal her blade.
8630,LXXII,
8631,LXXIII,LXXIII
8632,LXXIII,"Lord Guelpho struck again, but hit her not,"
8633,LXXIII,"For strong Osmida haply passed by,"
8634,LXXIII,"And not meant him, another’s wound he got,"
8635,LXXIII,That cleft his front in twain above his eye:
8636,LXXIII,"Near Guelpho now the battle waxed hot,"
8637,LXXIII,"For all the troops he led gan thither hie,"
8638,LXXIII,"And thither drew eke many a Paynim knight,"
8639,LXXIII,"That fierce, stern, bloody, deadly waxed the fight."
8640,LXXIII,
8641,LXXIV,LXXIV
8642,LXXIV,Meanwhile the purple morning peeped o’er
8643,LXXIV,"The eastern threshold to our half of land,"
8644,LXXIV,And Argillano in this great uproar
8645,LXXIV,"From prison loosed was, and what he fand,"
8646,LXXIV,"Those arms he hent, and to the field them bore,"
8647,LXXIV,"Resolved to take his chance what came to hand,"
8648,LXXIV,And with great acts amid the Pagan host
8649,LXXIV,Would win again his reputation lost.
8650,LXXIV,
8651,LXXV,LXXV
8652,LXXV,"As a fierce steed ’scaped from his stall at large,"
8653,LXXV,"Where he had long been kept for warlike need,"
8654,LXXV,Runs through the fields unto the flowery marge
8655,LXXV,"Of some green forest where he used to feed,"
8656,LXXV,His curled mane his shoulders broad doth charge
8657,LXXV,"And from his lofty crest doth spring and spreed,"
8658,LXXV,"Thunder his feet, his nostrils fire breathe out,"
8659,LXXV,And with his neigh the world resounds about.
8660,LXXV,
8661,LXXVI,LXXVI
8662,LXXVI,"So Argillan rushed forth, sparkled his eyes,"
8663,LXXVI,"His front high lifted was, no fear therein,"
8664,LXXVI,"Lightly he leaps and skips, it seems he flies,"
8665,LXXVI,"He left no sign in dust imprinted thin,"
8666,LXXVI,"And coming near his foes, he sternly cries,"
8667,LXXVI,"As one that forced not all their strength a pin,"
8668,LXXVI,"“You outcasts of the world, you men of naught"
8669,LXXVI,What hath in you this boldness newly wrought?
8670,LXXVI,
8671,LXXVII,LXXVII
8672,LXXVII,“Too weak are you to bear a helm or shield
8673,LXXVII,"Unfit to arm your breast in iron bright,"
8674,LXXVII,"You run half-naked trembling through the field,"
8675,LXXVII,"Your blows are feeble, and your hope in flight,"
8676,LXXVII,"Your facts and all the actions that you wield,"
8677,LXXVII,"The darkness hides, your bulwark is the night,"
8678,LXXVII,"Now she is gone, how will your fights succeed?"
8679,LXXVII,Now better arms and better hearts you need.”
8680,LXXVII,
8681,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
8682,LXXVIII,"While thus he spoke, he gave a cruel stroke"
8683,LXXVIII,Against Algazel’s throat with might and main;
8684,LXXVIII,"And as he would have answered him, and spoke,"
8685,LXXVIII,"He stopped his words, and cut his jaws in twain;"
8686,LXXVIII,"Upon his eyes death spread his misty cloak,"
8687,LXXVIII,"A chilling frost congealed every vein,"
8688,LXXVIII,"He fell, and with his teeth the earth he tore,"
8689,LXXVIII,"Raging in death, and full of rage before."
8690,LXXVIII,
8691,LXXIX,LXXIX
8692,LXXIX,"Then by his puissance mighty Saladine,"
8693,LXXIX,"Proud Agricalt and Muleasses died,"
8694,LXXIX,"And at one wondrous blow his weapon fine,"
8695,LXXIX,"Did Adiazel in two parts divide,"
8696,LXXIX,"Then through the breast he wounded Ariadine,"
8697,LXXIX,"Whom dying with sharp taunts he gan deride,"
8698,LXXIX,"He lifting up uneath his feeble eyes,"
8699,LXXIX,"To his proud scorns thus answereth, ere he dies:"

8705,LXXX,Which by my side will shortly lay thee low:”
8706,LXXX,"He smiled, and said, “Of mine hour short or long"
8707,LXXX,"Let heaven take care; but here meanwhile die thou,"
8708,LXXX,"Pasture for wolves and crows,” on him his foot"

8715,LXXXI,"Yet blossomed out her flowers, small or light;"
8716,LXXXI,The sweat spread on his cheeks with heat and rage
8717,LXXXI,"Seemed pearls or morning dews on lilies white,"
8718,LXXXI,"The dust therein uprolled adorned his hair,"
8719,LXXXI,"His face seemed fierce and sweet, wrathful and fair."
8720,LXXXI,
8721,LXXXII,LXXXII
8722,LXXXII,"His steed was white, and white as purest snow"

8725,LXXXII,"As he, to run, to stop, to turn and twine;"
8726,LXXXII,"A dart his right hand shaked, prest to throw;"
8727,LXXXII,"His cutlass by his thigh, short, hooked, fine,"
8728,LXXXII,"And braving in his Turkish pomp he shone,"
8729,LXXXII,"In purple robe, o’erfret with gold and stone."
8730,LXXXII,
8731,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
8732,LXXXIII,"The hardy boy, while thirst of warlike praise"

8735,LXXXIII,"And little danger found, though much he sought,"
8736,LXXXIII,"Till Argillan, that watched fit time always"
8737,LXXXIII,"In his swift turns to strike him as he fought,"
8738,LXXXIII,"Did unawares his snow-white courser slay,"

8740,LXXXIII,
8741,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
8742,LXXXIV,"And gainst his face, where love and pity stand,"
8743,LXXXIV,"To pray him that rich throne of beauty spare,"
8744,LXXXIV,"The cruel man stretched forth his murdering hand,"
8745,LXXXIV,"To spoil those gifts, whereof he had no share:"
8746,LXXXIV,It seemed remorse and sense was in his brand
8747,LXXXIV,"Which, lighting flat, to hurt the lad forbare;"
8748,LXXXIV,"But all for naught, gainst him the point he bent"
8749,LXXXIV,"That, what the edge had spared, pierced and rent."

8752,LXXXV,Fierce Solyman that with Godfredo strived
8753,LXXXV,"Who first should enter conquest’s glorious gate,"
8754,LXXXV,"Left off the fray and thither headlong drived,"
8755,LXXXV,When first he saw the lad in such estate;
8756,LXXXV,"He brake the press, and soon enough arrived"
8757,LXXXV,"To take revenge, but to his aid too late,"
8758,LXXXV,"Because he saw his Lesbine slain and lost,"
8759,LXXXV,Like a sweet flower nipped with untimely frost.
8760,LXXXV,
8761,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
8762,LXXXVI,"He saw wax dim the starlight of his eyes,"
8763,LXXXVI,"His ivory neck upon his shoulders fell,"
8764,LXXXVI,"In his pale looks kind pity’s image lies,"
8765,LXXXVI,"That death even mourned, to hear his passing bell."
8766,LXXXVI,"His marble heart such soft impression tries,"
8767,LXXXVI,"That midst his wrath his manly tears outwell,"

8769,LXXXVI,"Thy kingdoms lost, and not one tear could yield."
8770,LXXXVI,
8771,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
8772,LXXXVII,But when the murderer’s sword he hapt to view
8773,LXXXVII,"Dropping with blood of his Lesbino dead,"
8774,LXXXVII,"His pity vanished, ire and rage renew,"
8775,LXXXVII,He had no leisure bootless tears to shed;
8776,LXXXVII,"But with his blade on Argillano flew,"
8777,LXXXVII,"And cleft his shield, his helmet, and his head,"
8778,LXXXVII,Down to his throat; and worthy was that blow
8779,LXXXVII,"Of Solyman, his strength and wrath to show:"
8780,LXXXVII,
8781,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
8782,LXXXVIII,"And not content with this, down from his horse"
8783,LXXXVIII,"He lights, and that dead carcass rent and tore,"
8784,LXXXVIII,Like a fierce dog that takes his angry course
8785,LXXXVIII,To bite the stone which had him hit before.
8786,LXXXVIII,"Oh comfort vain for grief of so great force,"
8787,LXXXVIII,To wound the senseless earth that feels no sore!
8788,LXXXVIII,But mighty Godfrey ’gainst the Soldan’s train
8789,LXXXVIII,"Spent not, this while, his force and blows in vain."

8807,XC,"Then both Rossano’s arms, in every rank"
8808,XC,"The boldest knights, of all that chosen crew,"
8809,XC,"He felled, maimed, wounded, hurt and slew."

8812,XCI,While thus he killed many a Saracine

8817,XCI,"Lightning of war in midst thereof contained,"
8818,XCI,"Whence unawares burst forth a storm of swords,"

8835,XCIII,Drowning in blood him that from blows escapes.
8836,XCIII,The king meanwhile with parcel of his train
8837,XCIII,"Comes hastily out, and for sure conquest gapes,"
8838,XCIII,"And from a bank whereon he stood, beheld"
8839,XCIII,The doubtful hazard of that bloody field.
8840,XCIII,
8841,XCIV,XCIV
8842,XCIV,"But when he saw the Pagans shrink away,"

8845,XCIV,Argantes and Clorinda to retire;
8846,XCIV,"The furious couple both at once said nay,"
8847,XCIV,"Even drunk with shedding blood, and mad with ire,"

8856,XCV,A hollow dale the city’s bulwarks near
8857,XCV,"From west to south outstretched long doth lie,"
8858,XCV,"Thither they fled, and in a mist of dust,"
8859,XCV,"Toward the walls they run, they throng, they thrust."
8860,XCV,
8861,XCVI,XCVI
8862,XCVI,"While down the bank disordered thus they ran,"
8863,XCVI,The Christian knights huge slaughter on them made;
8864,XCVI,"But when to climb the other hill they gan,"
8865,XCVI,Old Aladine came fiercely to their aid:
8866,XCVI,On that steep brae Lord Guelpho would not than
8867,XCVI,"Hazard his folk, but there his soldiers stayed,"
8868,XCVI,And safe within the city’s walls the king.

8870,XCVI,
8871,XCVII,XCVII
8872,XCVII,Meanwhile the Soldan in this latest charge
8873,XCVII,"Had done as much as human force was able,"
8874,XCVII,"All sweat and blood appeared his members large,"
8875,XCVII,"His breath was short, his courage waxed unstable,"
8876,XCVII,"His arm grew weak to bear his mighty targe,"
8877,XCVII,"His hand to rule his heavy sword unable,"
8878,XCVII,"Which bruised, not cut, so blunted was the blade"
8879,XCVII,It lost the use for which a sword was made.
8880,XCVII,
8881,XCVIII,XCVIII
8882,XCVIII,"Feeling his weakness, he gan musing stand,"
8883,XCVIII,"And in his troubled thought this question tossed,"
8884,XCVIII,"If he himself should murder with his hand,"
8885,XCVIII,"Because none else should of his conquest boast,"
8886,XCVIII,"Or he should save his life, when on the land"
8887,XCVIII,"Lay slain the pride of his subdued host,"
8888,XCVIII,"“At last to fortune’s power,” quoth he, “I yield,"

9083,XVII,"How he bewondered was, and how he fared,"

9143,XXIII,Whereto great Solyman gan thus reply:
9144,XXIII,“O happy man to so great praise ybore!”
9145,XXIII,"Thus he rejoiced, but yet envied more;"
9146,XXIII,
9147,XXIV,XXIV
9148,XXIV,"And said, “Let chance with good or bad aspect"

9178,XXVII,"Deeply he sighed, and with naked sword"
9179,XXVII,"Out of the coach he leaped in the mire,"
9180,XXVII,"But Ismen called again the angry lord,"
9181,XXVII,And with grave words appeased his foolish ire.
9182,XXVII,"The prince content remounted at his sword,"
9183,XXVII,"Toward a hill on drove the aged sire,"
9184,XXVII,"And hasting forward up the bank they pass,"
9185,XXVII,Till far behind the Christian leaguer was.
9186,XXVII,
9187,XXVIII,XXVIII
9188,XXVIII,"There they alight and took their way on foot,"
9189,XXVIII,"The empty chariot vanished out of sight,"
9190,XXVIII,Yet still the cloud environed them about.
9191,XXVIII,At their left hand down went they from the height
9192,XXVIII,"Of Sion’s Hill, till they approached the route"
9193,XXVIII,"On that side where to west he looketh right,"
9194,XXVIII,"There Ismen stayed, and his eyesight bent"

9196,XXVIII,
9197,XXIX,XXIX
9198,XXIX,"A hollow cave was in the craggy stone,"
9199,XXIX,"Wrought out by hand a number years tofore,"

9201,XXIX,"The vault was hid with plants and bushes hoar,"
9202,XXIX,"The wizard stooping in thereat to gone,"
9203,XXIX,"The thorns aside and scratching brambles bore,"
9204,XXIX,"His right hand sought the passage through the cleft,"
9205,XXIX,And for his guide he gave the prince his left:
9206,XXIX,
9207,XXX,XXX
9208,XXX,"“What,” quoth the Soldan, “by what privy mine,"
9209,XXX,What hidden vault behoves it me to creep?
9210,XXX,"This sword can find a better way than thine,"
9211,XXX,Although our foes the passage guard and keep.”
9212,XXX,"“Let not,” quoth he, “thy princely foot repine"
9213,XXX,"To tread this secret path, though dark and deep;"
9214,XXX,"For great King Herod used to tread the same,"
9215,XXX,He that in arms had whilom so great fame.
9216,XXX,
9217,XXXI,XXXI
9218,XXXI,"“This passage made he, when he would suppress"
9219,XXXI,"His subjects’ pride, and them in bondage hold;"
9220,XXXI,By this he could from that small forteress
9221,XXXI,"Antonia called, of Antony the bold,"
9222,XXXI,Convey his folk unseen of more and less
9223,XXXI,"Even to the middest of the temple old,"
9224,XXXI,"Thence, hither; where these privy ways begin,"
9225,XXXI,And bring unseen whole armies out and in.

9228,XXXII,“But now saye I in all this world lives none
9229,XXXII,"That knows the secret of this darksome place,"
9230,XXXII,"Come then where Aladine sits on his throne,"
9231,XXXII,With lords and princes set about his grace;
9232,XXXII,"He feareth more than fitteth such an one,"
9233,XXXII,Such signs of doubt show in his cheer and face;
9234,XXXII,"Fitly you come, hear, see, and keep you still,"

9236,XXXII,
9237,XXXIII,XXXIII
9238,XXXIII,"This said, that narrow entrance passed the knight,"
9239,XXXIII,"So creeps a camel through a needle’s eye,"
9240,XXXIII,And through the ways as black as darkest night
9241,XXXIII,He followed him that did him rule and guie;
9242,XXXIII,"Strait was the way at first, withouten light,"
9243,XXXIII,"But further in, did further amplify;"
9244,XXXIII,So that upright walked at ease the men
9245,XXXIII,"Ere they had passed half that secret den,"
9246,XXXIII,
9247,XXXIV,XXXIV
9248,XXXIV,"A privy door Ismen unlocked at last,"
9249,XXXIV,"And up they clomb a little-used stair,"
9250,XXXIV,"Thereat the day a feeble beam in cast,"
9251,XXXIV,"Dim was the light, and nothing clear the air;"
9252,XXXIV,Out of the hollow cave at length they passed
9253,XXXIV,"Into a goodly hall, high, broad and fair,"
9254,XXXIV,"Where crowned with gold, and all in purple clad"
9255,XXXIV,"Sate the sad king, among his nobles sad."

9258,XXXV,"The Turk, close in his hollow cloud imbarred,"
9259,XXXV,"Unseen, at will did all the prease behold,"
9260,XXXV,"These heavy speeches of the king he heard,"
9261,XXXV,Who thus from lofty siege his pleasure told;
9262,XXXV,"“My lords, last day our state was much impaired,"
9263,XXXV,"Our friends were slain, killed were our soldiers bold,"
9264,XXXV,"Great helps and greater hopes are us bereft,"
9265,XXXV,Nor aught but aid from Egypt land is left:
9266,XXXV,
9267,XXXVI,XXXVI
9268,XXXVI,"“And well you see far distant is that aid,"
9269,XXXVI,"Upon our heels our danger treadeth still,"
9270,XXXVI,"For your advice was this assembly made,"
9271,XXXVI,"Each what he thinketh speak, and what he will.”"
9272,XXXVI,"A whisper soft arose when this was said,"
9273,XXXVI,"As gentle winds the groves with murmur fill,"
9274,XXXVI,"But with bold face, high looks and merry cheer,"
9275,XXXVI,"Argantes rose, the rest their talk forbear."
9276,XXXVI,
9277,XXXVII,XXXVII
9278,XXXVII,"“O worthy sovereign,” thus began to say"
9279,XXXVII,"The hardy young man to the tyrant wise,"
9280,XXXVII,“What words be these?  what fears do you dismay?
9281,XXXVII,"Who knows not this, you need not our advice!"
9282,XXXVII,"But on your hand your hope of conquest lay,"
9283,XXXVII,"And, for no loss true virtue damnifies,"
9284,XXXVII,"Make her our shield, pray her us succors give,"
9285,XXXVII,And without her let us not wish to live.
9286,XXXVII,
9287,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
9288,XXXVIII,“Nor say I this for that I aught misdeem
9289,XXXVIII,"That Egypt’s promised succors fail us might,"
9290,XXXVIII,Doubtful of my great master’s words to seem
9291,XXXVIII,"To me were neither lawful, just, nor right!"
9292,XXXVIII,"I speak these words, for spurs I them esteem"
9293,XXXVIII,"To waken up each dull and fearful sprite,"
9294,XXXVIII,"And make our hearts resolved to all assays,"
9295,XXXVIII,"To win with honor, or to die with praise.”"
9296,XXXVIII,
9297,XXXIX,XXXIX
9298,XXXIX,"Thus much Argantes said, and said no more,"
9299,XXXIX,As if the case were clear of which he spoke.
9300,XXXIX,"Orcano rose, of princely stem ybore,"
9301,XXXIX,"Whose presence ’mongst them bore a mighty stroke,"
9302,XXXIX,"A man esteemed well in arms of yore,"
9303,XXXIX,But now was coupled new in marriage yoke;
9304,XXXIX,"Young babes he had, to fight which made him loth,"

9341,XLIII,"On naught but shedding blood, and conquest thought,"
9342,XLIII,"Too little is this city to sustain,"
9343,XLIII,To raise the siege unless some means be sought;
9344,XLIII,And it must last till the prefixed hour

9884,XVIII,"To intimate his will on every side,"
9885,XVIII,"And published it through all the lodgings broad,"
9886,XVIII,That gainst the morn each should himself provide;
9887,XVIII,"Meanwhile they might their hearts of cares unload,"
9888,XVIII,And rest their tired limbs that eveningtide;
9889,XVIII,"Thus fared they till night their eyes did close,"
9890,XVIII,Night friend to gentle rest and sweet repose.
9891,XVIII,
9892,XIX,XIX
9893,XIX,With little sign as yet of springing day
9894,XIX,"Out peeped, not well appeared the rising morn,"
9895,XIX,"The plough yet tore not up the fertile lay,"
9896,XIX,"Nor to their feed the sheep from folds return,"
9897,XIX,The birds sate silent on the greenwood spray
9898,XIX,"Amid the groves unheard was hound and horn,"
9899,XIX,"When trumpets shrill, true signs of hardy fights,"
9900,XIX,"Called up to arms the soldiers, called the knights:"
9901,XIX,
9902,XX,XX
9903,XX,"“Arm, arm at once!” an hundred squadrons cried,"
9904,XX,And with their cry to arm them all begin.
9905,XX,"Godfrey arose, that day he laid aside"
9906,XX,"His hauberk strong he wonts to combat in,"
9907,XX,"And donned a breastplate fair, of proof untried,"
9908,XX,"Such one as footmen use, light, easy, thin."
9909,XX,"Scantly the warlord thus clothed had his gromes,"
9910,XX,When aged Raymond to his presence comes.
9911,XX,
9912,XXI,XXI
9913,XXI,"And furnished to us when he the man beheld,"
9914,XXI,"By his attire his secret thought he guessed,"
9915,XXI,"“Where is,” quoth he, “your sure and trusty shield?"
9916,XXI,"Your helm, your hauberk strong?  where all the rest?"
9917,XXI,Why be you half disarmed?  why to the field
9918,XXI,Approach you in these weak defences dressed?
9919,XXI,"I see this day you mean a course to run,"
9920,XXI,"Wherein may peril much, small praise be won."
9921,XXI,
9922,XXII,XXII
9923,XXII,"“Alas, do you that idle prise expect,"
9924,XXII,To set first foot this conquered wall above?
9925,XXII,Of less account some knight thereto object
9926,XXII,Whose loss so great and harmful cannot prove;
9927,XXII,"My lord, your life with greater care protect,"
9928,XXII,"And love yourself because all us you love,"
9929,XXII,"Your happy life is spirit, soul, and breath"
9930,XXII,"Of all this camp, preserve it then from death.”"
9931,XXII,
9932,XXIII,XXIII
9933,XXIII,"To this he answered thus, “You know,” he said,"
9934,XXIII,“In Clarimont by mighty Urban’s hand
9935,XXIII,"When I was girded with this noble blade,"
9936,XXIII,"For Christ’s true faith to fight in every land,"
9937,XXIII,"To God even then a secret vow I made,"
9938,XXIII,Not as a captain here this day to stand
9939,XXIII,"And give directions, but with shield and sword"
9940,XXIII,"To fight, to win, or die for Christ my Lord."
9941,XXIII,
9942,XXIV,XXIV
9943,XXIV,“When all this camp in battle strong shall be
9944,XXIV,"Ordained and ordered, well disposed all,"
9945,XXIV,And all things done which to the high degree
9946,XXIV,And sacred place I hold belongen shall;
9947,XXIV,"Then reason is it, nor dissuade thou me,"
9948,XXIV,"That I likewise assault this sacred wall,"
9949,XXIV,Lest from my vow to God late made I swerve:
9950,XXIV,"He shall this life defend, keep and preserve.”"
9951,XXIV,
9952,XXV,XXV
9953,XXV,"Thus he concludes, and every hardy knight"
9954,XXV,"His sample followed, and his brethren twain,"
9955,XXV,"The other princes put on harness light,"
9956,XXV,As footmen use: but all the Pagan train
9957,XXV,Toward that side bent their defensive might
9958,XXV,Which lies exposed to view of Charles’s wain
9959,XXV,"And Zephyrus’ sweet blasts, for on that part"
9960,XXV,"The town was weakest, both by side and art."
9961,XXV,
9962,XXVI,XXVI
9963,XXVI,"On all parts else the fort was strong by site,"
9964,XXVI,"With mighty hills defenced from foreign rage,"
9965,XXVI,And to this part the tyrant gan unite
9966,XXVI,"His subjects born and bands that serve for wage,"
9967,XXVI,"From this exploit he spared nor great nor lite,"
9968,XXVI,"The aged men, and boys of tender age,"
9969,XXVI,"To fire of angry war still brought new fuel,"
9970,XXVI,"Stones, darts, lime, brimstone and bitumen cruel."
9971,XXVI,
9972,XXVII,XXVII
9973,XXVII,"All full of arms and weapons was the wall,"
9974,XXVII,"Under whose basis that fair plain doth run,"
9975,XXVII,"There stood the Soldan like a giant tall,"
9976,XXVII,"So stood at Rhodes the Coloss of the sun,"
9977,XXVII,"Waist high, Argantes showed himself withal,"
9978,XXVII,"At whose stern looks the French to quake begun,"
9979,XXVII,"Clorinda on the corner tower alone,"
9980,XXVII,In silver arms like rising Cynthia shone.
9981,XXVII,
9982,XXVIII,XXVIII
9983,XXVIII,"Her rattling quiver at her shoulders hung,"
9984,XXVIII,Therein a flash of arrows feathered weel.
9985,XXVIII,"In her left hand her bow was bended strong,"
9986,XXVIII,"Therein a shaft headed with mortal steel,"
9987,XXVIII,So fit to shoot she singled forth among
9988,XXVIII,"Her foes who first her quarries’ strength should feel,"
9989,XXVIII,So fit to shoot Latona’s daughter stood
9990,XXVIII,When Niobe she killed and all her brood.
9991,XXVIII,
9992,XXIX,XXIX
9993,XXIX,The aged tyrant tottered on his feet
9994,XXIX,"From gate to gate, from wall to wall he flew,"
9995,XXIX,"He comforts all his bands with speeches sweet,"
9996,XXIX,"And every fort and bastion doth review,"
9997,XXIX,For every need prepared in every street
9998,XXIX,New regiments he placed and weapons new.
9999,XXIX,The matrons grave within their temples high
10000,XXIX,"To idols false for succors call and cry,"

10006,XXX,His rebel blood pour out upon these sands;”
10007,XXX,These cries within his ears no enterance
10008,XXX,"Could find, for naught he hears, naught understands."
10009,XXX,"While thus the town for her defence ordains,"

10013,XXXI,"His forces first on foot he forward brought,"

10016,XXXI,"In battles twain his strength he doth depart,"
10017,XXXI,"Between them crossbows stood, and engines wrought"
10018,XXXI,"To cast a stone, a quarry, or a dart,"
10019,XXXI,From whence like thunder’s dint or lightnings new
10020,XXXI,Against the bulwark stones and lances flew.

10023,XXXII,"His men at arms did back his bands on foot,"
10024,XXXII,"The light horse ride far off and serve for wings,"
10025,XXXII,"He gave the sign, so mighty was the rout"
10026,XXXII,"Of those that shot with bows and cast with slings,"
10027,XXXII,"Such storms of shafts and stones flew all about,"
10028,XXXII,"That many a Pagan proud to death it brings,"
10029,XXXII,"Some died, some at their loops durst scant outpeep,"
10030,XXXII,Some fled and left the place they took to keep.
10031,XXXII,
10032,XXXIII,XXXIII
10033,XXXIII,"The hardy Frenchmen, full of heat and haste,"
10034,XXXIII,"Ran boldly forward to the ditches large,"
10035,XXXIII,And o’er their heads an iron pentice vast
10036,XXXIII,"They built, by joining many a shield and targe,"
10037,XXXIII,"Some with their engines ceaseless shot and cast,"
10038,XXXIII,"And volleys huge of arrows sharp discharge,"
10039,XXXIII,Upon the ditches some employed their pain
10040,XXXIII,To fill the moat and even it with the plain.
10041,XXXIII,
10042,XXXIV,XXXIV
10043,XXXIV,"With slime or mud the ditches were not soft,"
10044,XXXIV,"But dry and sandy, void of waters clear,"
10045,XXXIV,"Though large and deep the Christians fill them oft,"
10046,XXXIV,"With rubbish, fagots, stones, and trees they bear:"
10047,XXXIV,"Adrastus first advanced his crest aloft,"
10048,XXXIV,"And boldly gan a strong scalado rear,"
10049,XXXIV,And through the falling storm did upward climb
10050,XXXIV,"Of stones, darts, arrows, fire, pitch and lime:"
10051,XXXIV,
10052,XXXV,XXXV
10053,XXXV,The hardy Switzer now so far was gone
10054,XXXV,"That half way up with mickle pain he got,"
10055,XXXV,"A thousand weapons he sustained alone,"
10056,XXXV,And his audacious climbing ceased not;
10057,XXXV,"At last upon him fell a mighty stone,"
10058,XXXV,"As from some engine great it had been shot,"
10059,XXXV,"It broke his helm, he tumbled from the height,"
10060,XXXV,The strong Circassian cast that wondrous weight;
10061,XXXV,
10062,XXXVI,XXXVI
10063,XXXVI,"Not mortal was the blow, yet with the fall"
10064,XXXVI,On earth sore bruised the man lay in a swoon.
10065,XXXVI,"Argantes gan with boasting words to call,"
10066,XXXVI,"“Who cometh next?  this first is tumbled down,"
10067,XXXVI,"Come, hardy soldiers, come, assault this wall,"
10068,XXXVI,"I will not shrink, nor fly, nor hide my crown,"
10069,XXXVI,"If in your trench yourselves for dread you hold,"
10070,XXXVI,There shall you die like sheep killed in their fold.”
10071,XXXVI,
10072,XXXVII,XXXVII
10073,XXXVII,"Thus boasted he; but in their trenches deep,"
10074,XXXVII,"The hidden squadrons kept themselves from scath,"
10075,XXXVII,The curtain made of shields did well off keep
10076,XXXVII,"Both darts and shot, and scorned all their wrath."
10077,XXXVII,"But now the ram upon the rampiers steep,"
10078,XXXVII,"On mighty beams his head advanced hath,"
10079,XXXVII,"With dreadful horns of iron tough tree great,"
10080,XXXVII,The walls and bulwarks trembled at his threat.
10081,XXXVII,
10082,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
10083,XXXVIII,An hundred able men meanwhile let fall
10084,XXXVIII,"The weights behind, the engine tumbled down"
10085,XXXVIII,And battered flat the battlements and wall:
10086,XXXVIII,"So fell Taigetus hill on Sparta town,"
10087,XXXVIII,"It crushed the steeled shield in pieces small,"
10088,XXXVIII,"And beat the helmet to the wearers’ crown,"
10089,XXXVIII,"And on the ruins of the walls and stones,"
10090,XXXVIII,Dispersed left their blood their brains and bones.
10091,XXXVIII,
10092,XXXIX,XXXIX
10093,XXXIX,The fierce assailants kept no longer close
10094,XXXIX,"Undcr the shelter of their target fine,"
10095,XXXIX,"But their bold fronts to chance of war expose,"
10096,XXXIX,"And gainst those towers let their virtue shine,"
10097,XXXIX,"The scaling ladders up to skies arose,"
10098,XXXIX,"The ground-works deep some closely undermine,"
10099,XXXIX,"The walls before the Frenchmen shrink and shake,"
10100,XXXIX,And gaping sign of headlong falling make:
10101,XXXIX,
10102,XL,XL
10103,XL,"And fallen they had, so far the strength extends"
10104,XL,"Of that fierce ram and his redoubted stroke,"
10105,XL,But that the Pagan’s care the place defends
10106,XL,And saved by warlike skill the wall nigh broke:
10107,XL,"For to what part soe’er the engine bends,"
10108,XL,"Their sacks of wool they place the blow to choke,"
10109,XL,"Whose yielding breaks the strokes thereon which light,"
10110,XL,So weakness oft subdues the greatest might.
10111,XL,
10112,XLI,XLI
10113,XLI,While thus the worthies of the western crew
10114,XLI,"Maintained their brave assault and skirmish hot,"
10115,XLI,"Her mighty bow Clorinda often drew,"
10116,XLI,And many a sharp and deadly arrow shot;
10117,XLI,And from her bow no steeled shaft there flew
10118,XLI,"But that some blood the cursed engine got,"
10119,XLI,"Blood of some valiant knight or man of fame,"
10120,XLI,For that proud shootress scorned weaker game.
10121,XLI,
10122,XLII,XLII
10123,XLII,The first she hit among the Christian peers
10124,XLII,"Was the bold son of England’s noble king,"
10125,XLII,"Above the trench himself he scantly rears,"
10126,XLII,"But she an arrow loosed from the string,"
10127,XLII,"The wicked steel his gauntlet breaks and tears,"
10128,XLII,And through his right hand thrust the piercing sting;
10129,XLII,"Disabled thus from fight, he gan retire,"
10130,XLII,"Groaning for pain, but fretting more for ire."
10131,XLII,
10132,XLIII,XLIII
10133,XLIII,"Lord Stephen of Amboise on the ditch’s brim,"
10134,XLIII,"And on a ladder high, Clotharius died,"
10135,XLIII,"From back to breast an arrow pierced him,"
10136,XLIII,The other was shot through from side to side:
10137,XLIII,"Then as he managed brave his courser trim,"
10138,XLIII,"On his left arm he hit the Flemings’ guide,"
10139,XLIII,"He stopped, and from the wound the reed out-twined,"
10140,XLIII,But left the iron in his flesh behind.
10141,XLIII,
10142,XLIV,XLIV
10143,XLIV,As Ademare stood to behold the fight
10144,XLIV,"High on the bank, withdrawn to breathe a space,"
10145,XLIV,"A fatal shaft upon his forehead light,"
10146,XLIV,"His hand he lifted up to feel the place,"
10147,XLIV,"Whereon a second arrow chanced right,"
10148,XLIV,"And nailed his hand unto his wounded face,"
10149,XLIV,"He fell, and with his blood distained the land,"
10150,XLIV,His holy blood shed by a virgin’s hand.
10151,XLIV,
10152,XLV,XLV
10153,XLV,"While Palamede stood near the battlement,"
10154,XLV,"Despising perils all, and all mishap,"
10155,XLV,"And upward still his hardy footings bent,"
10156,XLV,"On his right eye he caught a deadly clap,"
10157,XLV,"Through his right eye Clorinda’s seventh shaft went,"
10158,XLV,And in his neck broke forth a bloody gap;
10159,XLV,"He underneath that bulwark dying fell,"
10160,XLV,Which late to scale and win he trusted well.
10161,XLV,
10162,XLVI,XLVI
10163,XLVI,Thus shot the maid: the duke with hard assay
10164,XLVI,"And sharp assault, meanwhile the town oppressed,"
10165,XLVI,Against that part which to his campward lay
10166,XLVI,"An engine huge and wondrous he addressed,"
10167,XLVI,A tower of wood built for the town’s decay
10168,XLVI,"As high as were the walls and bulwarks best,"
10169,XLVI,"A turret full of men and weapons pent,"
10170,XLVI,"And yet on wheels it rolled, moved, and went."
10171,XLVI,
10172,XLVII,XLVII
10173,XLVII,"This rolling fort his nigh approaches made,"
10174,XLVII,"And darts and arrows spit against his foes,"
10175,XLVII,"As ships are wont in fight, so it assayed"
10176,XLVII,"With the strong wall to grapple and to close,"
10177,XLVII,"The Pagans on each side the piece invade,"
10178,XLVII,"And all their force against this mass oppose,"
10179,XLVII,"Sometimes the wheels, sometimes the battlement"
10180,XLVII,"With timber, logs and stones, they broke and rent,"
10181,XLVII,
10182,XLVIII,XLVIII
10183,XLVIII,"So thick flew stones and darts, that no man sees"
10184,XLVIII,"The azure heavens, the sun his brightness lost,"
10185,XLVIII,"The clouds of weapons, like to swarms of bees,"
10186,XLVIII,"Move the air, and there each other crossed:"
10187,XLVIII,"And look how falling leaves drop down from trees,"
10188,XLVIII,"When the moist sap is nipped with timely frost,"
10189,XLVIII,Or apples in strong winds from branches fall;
10190,XLVIII,The Saracens so tumbled from the wall.
10191,XLVIII,
10192,XLIX,XLIX
10193,XLIX,"For on their part the greatest slaughter light,"
10194,XLIX,"They had no shelter gainst so sharp a shower,"
10195,XLIX,"Some left on live betook themselves to flight,"
10196,XLIX,So feared they this deadly thundering tower:
10197,XLIX,"But Solyman stayed like a valiant knight,"
10198,XLIX,"And some with him, that trusted in his power,"
10199,XLIX,"Argantes with a long beech tree in hand,"
10200,XLIX,"Ran thither, this huge engine to withstand:"
10201,XLIX,
10202,L,L
10203,L,"With this he pushed the tower, and back it drives"
10204,L,"The length of all his tree, a wondrous way,"
10205,L,"The hardy virgin by his side arrives,"
10206,L,To help Argantes in this hard assay:
10207,L,"The band that used the ram, this season strives"
10208,L,"To cut the cords, wherein the woolpacks lay,"
10209,L,"Which done, the sacks down in the trenches fall,"
10210,L,And to the battery naked left the wall.
10211,L,
10212,LI,LI
10213,LI,"The tower above, the ram beneath doth thunder,"
10214,LI,What lime and stone such puissance could abide?
10215,LI,"The wall began, new bruised and crushed asunder,"
10216,LI,"Her wounded lap to open broad and wide,"
10217,LI,Godfrey himself and his brought safely under
10218,LI,"The shattered wall, where greatest breach he spied,"
10219,LI,"Himself he saves behind his mighty targe,"
10220,LI,A shield not used but in some desperate charge.
10221,LI,
10222,LII,LII
10223,LII,"From hence he sees where Solyman descends,"
10224,LII,"Down to the threshold of the gaping breach,"
10225,LII,And there it seems the mighty prince intends
10226,LII,Godfredo’s hoped entrance to impeach:
10227,LII,"Argantes, and with him the maid, defends"
10228,LII,"The walls above, to which the tower doth reach,"
10229,LII,"His noble heart, when Godfrey this beheld,"
10230,LII,With courage new with wrath and valor swelled.
10231,LII,
10232,LIII,LIII
10233,LIII,"He turned about and to good Sigiere spake,"
10234,LIII,"Who bare his greatest shield and mighty bow,"
10235,LIII,"“That sure and trusty target let me take,"
10236,LIII,"Impenetrable is that shield I know,"
10237,LIII,"Over these ruins will I passage make,"
10238,LIII,"And enter first, the way is eath and low,"
10239,LIII,And time requires that by some noble feat
10240,LIII,I should make known my strength and puissance great.”
10241,LIII,
10242,LIV,LIV
10243,LIV,"He scant had spoken, scant received the charge,"
10244,LIV,"When on his leg a sudden shaft him hit,"
10245,LIV,"And through that part a hole made wide and large,"
10246,LIV,Where his strong sinews fastened were and knit.
10247,LIV,"Clorinda, thou this arrow didst discharge,"
10248,LIV,"And let the Pagans bless thy hand for it,"
10249,LIV,For by that shot thou savedst them that day
10250,LIV,"From bondage vile, from death and sure decay."
10251,LIV,
10252,LV,LV
10253,LV,"The wounded duke, as though he felt no pain,"
10254,LV,"Still forward went, and mounted up the breach"
10255,LV,"His high attempt at first he nould refrain,"
10256,LV,And after called his lords with cheerful speech;
10257,LV,"But when his leg could not his weight sustain,"
10258,LV,"He saw his will did far his power outreach,"
10259,LV,"And more he strove his grief increased the more,"
10260,LV,The bold assault he left at length therefore:
10261,LV,
10262,LVI,LVI
10263,LVI,"And with his hand he beckoned Guelpho near,"
10264,LVI,"And said, “I must withdraw me to my tent,"
10265,LVI,"My place and person in mine absence bear,"
10266,LVI,"Supply my want, let not the fight relent,"
10267,LVI,"I go, and will ere long again be here;"
10268,LVI,"I go and straight return:” this said, he went,"
10269,LVI,"On a light steed he leaped, and o’er the green"
10270,LVI,"He rode, but rode not, as he thought, unseen."
10271,LVI,
10272,LVII,LVII
10273,LVII,"When Godfrey parted, parted eke the heart,"
10274,LVII,"The strength and fortune of the Christian bands,"
10275,LVII,"Courage increased in their adverse part,"
10276,LVII,"Wrath in their hearts, and vigor in their hands:"
10277,LVII,"Valor, success, strength, hardiness and art,"
10278,LVII,"Failed in the princes of the western lands,"
10279,LVII,"Their swords were blunt, faint was their trumpet’s blast,"
10280,LVII,"Their sun was set, or else with clouds o’ercast."
10281,LVII,
10282,LVIII,LVIII
10283,LVIII,Upon the bulwarks now appeared bold
10284,LVIII,That fearful band that late for dread was fled!
10285,LVIII,"The women that Clorinda’s strength behold,"
10286,LVIII,"Their country’s love to war encouraged,"
10287,LVIII,"They weapons got, and fight like men they would,"
10288,LVIII,"Their gowns tucked up, their locks were loose and spread,"
10289,LVIII,"Sharp darts they cast, and without dread or fear,"
10290,LVIII,Exposed their breasts to save their fortress dear.
10291,LVIII,
10292,LIX,LIX
10293,LIX,"But that which most dismayed the Christian knights,"
10294,LIX,"And added courage to the Pagans most,"
10295,LIX,"Was Guelpho’s sudden fall in all men’s sights,"
10296,LIX,"Who tumbled headlong down, his footing lost,"
10297,LIX,"A mighty stone upon the worthy lights,"
10298,LIX,"But whence it came none wist, nor from what coast;"
10299,LIX,"And with like blow, which more their hearts dismayed,"
10300,LIX,Beside him low in dust old Raymond laid:
10301,LIX,
10302,LX,LX
10303,LX,"And Eustace eke within the ditches large,"
10304,LX,"To narrow shifts and last extremes they drive,"
10305,LX,"Upon their foes so fierce the Pagans charge,"
10306,LX,"And with good-fortune so their blows they give,"
10307,LX,"That whom they hit, in spite of helm or targe,"
10308,LX,"They deeply wound, or else of life deprive."
10309,LX,"At this their good success Argantes proud,"
10310,LX,"Waxing more fell, thus roared and cried aloud:"
10311,LX,
10312,LXI,LXI
10313,LXI,"“This is not Antioch, nor the evening dark"
10314,LXI,"Can help your privy sleights with friendly shade,"
10315,LXI,"The sun yet shines, your falsehood can we mark,"
10316,LXI,In other wise this bold assault is made;
10317,LXI,Of praise and glory quenched is the spark
10318,LXI,"That made you first these eastern lands invade,"
10319,LXI,Why cease you now?  why take you not this fort?
10320,LXI,What!  are you weary for a charge so short?”
10321,LXI,
10322,LXII,LXII
10323,LXII,"Thus raged he, and in such hellish sort"
10324,LXII,"Increased the fury in the brain-sick knight,"
10325,LXII,That he esteemed that large and ample fort
10326,LXII,"Too strait a field, wherein to prove his might,"
10327,LXII,"There where the breach had framed a new-made port,"
10328,LXII,"Himself he placed, with nimble skips and light,"
10329,LXII,"He cleared the passage out, and thus he cried"
10330,LXII,"To Solyman, that fought close by his side:"
10331,LXII,
10332,LXIII,LXIII
10333,LXIII,"“Come, Solyman, the time and place behold,"
10334,LXIII,"That of our valors well may judge the doubt,"
10335,LXIII,"What sayest thou?  amongst these Christians bold,"
10336,LXIII,First leap he forth that holds himself most stout:”
10337,LXIII,"While thus his will the mighty champion told,"
10338,LXIII,"Both Solyman and he at once leaped out,"
10339,LXIII,"Fury the first provoked, disdain the last,"
10340,LXIII,Who scorned the challenge ere his lips it passed.
10341,LXIII,
10342,LXIV,LXIV
10343,LXIV,"Upon their foes unlooked-for they flew,"
10344,LXIV,"Each spited other for his virtue’s sake,"
10345,LXIV,"So many soldiers this fierce couple slew,"
10346,LXIV,"So many shields they cleft and helms they break,"
10347,LXIV,"So many ladders to the earth they threw,"
10348,LXIV,"That well they seemed a mount thereof to make,"
10349,LXIV,"Or else some vamure fit to save the town,"
10350,LXIV,Instead of that the Christians late beat down.
10351,LXIV,
10352,LXV,LXV
10353,LXV,The folk that strove with rage and haste before
10354,LXV,"Who first the wall and rampire should ascend,"
10355,LXV,"Retire, and for that honor strive no more,"
10356,LXV,"Scantly they could their limbs and lives defend,"
10357,LXV,"They fled, their engines lost the Pagans tore"
10358,LXV,"In pieces small, their rams to naught they rend,"
10359,LXV,And all unfit for further service make
10360,LXV,With so great force and rage their beams they brake.
10361,LXV,
10362,LXVI,LXVI
10363,LXVI,"The Pagans ran transported with their ire,"
10364,LXVI,"Now here, now there, and woful slaughters wrought,"
10365,LXVI,"At last they called for devouring fire,"
10366,LXVI,"Two burning pines against the tower they brought,"
10367,LXVI,"So from the palace of their hellish sire,"
10368,LXVI,"When all this world they would consume to naught,"
10369,LXVI,"The fury sisters come with fire in hands,"
10370,LXVI,Shaking their snaky locks and sparkling brands:
10371,LXVI,
10372,LXVII,LXVII
10373,LXVII,"But noble Tancred, who this while applied"
10374,LXVII,"Grave exhortations to his bold Latines,"
10375,LXVII,"When of these knights the wondrous acts he spied,"
10376,LXVII,"And saw the champions with their burning pines,"
10377,LXVII,"He left his talk, and thither forthwith hied,"
10378,LXVII,To stop the rage of those fell Saracines.
10379,LXVII,"And with such force the fight he there renewed,"
10380,LXVII,That now they fled and lost who late pursued.
10381,LXVII,
10382,LXVIII,LXVIII
10383,LXVIII,"Thus changed the state and fortune of the fray,"
10384,LXVIII,"Meanwhile the wounded duke, in grief and teen,"
10385,LXVIII,"Within his great pavilion rich and gay,"
10386,LXVIII,Good Sigiere and Baldwin stood between;
10387,LXVIII,"His other friends whom his mishap dismay,"
10388,LXVIII,With grief and tears about assembled been:
10389,LXVIII,"He strove in haste the weapon out to wind,"
10390,LXVIII,"And broke the reed, but left the head behind."
10391,LXVIII,
10392,LXIX,LXIX
10393,LXIX,"He bade them take the speediest way they might,"
10394,LXIX,"Of that unlucky hurt to make him sound,"
10395,LXIX,"And to lay ope the depth thereof to sight,"
10396,LXIX,"He willed them open, search and lance the wound,"
10397,LXIX,"“Send me again,” quoth he, “to end this fight,"
10398,LXIX,Before the sun be sunken under ground;”
10399,LXIX,"And leaning on a broken spear, he thrust"
10400,LXIX,"His leg straight out, to him that cure it must."
10401,LXIX,
10402,LXX,LXX
10403,LXX,"Erotimus, born on the banks of Po,"
10404,LXX,"Was he that undertook to cure the knight,"
10405,LXX,"All what green herbs or waters pure could do,"
10406,LXX,"He knew their power, their virtue, and their might,"
10407,LXX,"A noble poet was the man also,"
10408,LXX,"But in this science had a more delight,"
10409,LXX,"He could restore to health death-wounded men,"
10410,LXX,And make their names immortal with his pen.
10411,LXX,
10412,LXXI,LXXI
10413,LXXI,"The mighty duke yet never changed cheer,"
10414,LXXI,But grieved to see his friends lamenting stand;
10415,LXXI,"The leech prepared his cloths and cleansing gear,"
10416,LXXI,"And with a belt his gown about him band,"
10417,LXXI,Now with his herbs the steely head to tear
10418,LXXI,"Out of the flesh he proved, now with his hand,"
10419,LXXI,"Now with his hand, now with his instrument"
10420,LXXI,"He shaked and plucked it, yet not forth it went."
10421,LXXI,
10422,LXXII,LXXII
10423,LXXII,"His labor vain, his art prevailed naught,"
10424,LXXII,"His luck was ill, although his skill were good,"
10425,LXXII,"To such extremes the wounded prince he brought,"
10426,LXXII,That with fell pain he swooned as he stood:
10427,LXXII,"But the angel pure, that kept him, went and sought"
10428,LXXII,"Divine dictamnum, out of Ida wood,"
10429,LXXII,"This herb is rough, and bears a purple flower,"
10430,LXXII,And in his budding leaves lies all his power.
10431,LXXII,
10432,LXXIII,LXXIII
10433,LXXIII,Kind nature first upon the craggy clift
10434,LXXIII,"Bewrayed this herb unto the mountain goat,"
10435,LXXIII,"That when her sides a cruel shaft hath rift,"
10436,LXXIII,With it she shakes the reed out of her coat;
10437,LXXIII,"This in a moment fetched the angel swift,"
10438,LXXIII,"And brought from Ida hill, though far remote,"
10439,LXXIII,The juice whereof in a prepared bath
10440,LXXIII,Unseen the blessed spirit poured hath.
10441,LXXIII,
10442,LXXIV,LXXIV
10443,LXXIV,"Pure nectar from that spring of Lydia than,"
10444,LXXIV,"And panaces divine therein he threw,"
10445,LXXIV,"The cunning leech to bathe the wound began,"
10446,LXXIV,And of itself the steely head outflew;
10447,LXXIV,"The bleeding stanched, no vermile drop outran,"
10448,LXXIV,The leg again waxed strong with vigor new:
10449,LXXIV,"Erotimus cried out, “This hurt and wound"
10450,LXXIV,No human art or hand so soon makes sound:
10451,LXXIV,
10452,LXXV,LXXV
10453,LXXV,“Some angel good I think come down from skies
10454,LXXV,"Thy surgeon is, for here plain tokens are"
10455,LXXV,"Of grace divine which to thy help applies,"
10456,LXXV,Thy weapon take and haste again to war.”
10457,LXXV,"In precious cloths his leg the chieftain ties,"
10458,LXXV,Naught could the man from blood and fight debar;
10459,LXXV,"A sturdy lance in his right hand he braced,"
10460,LXXV,"His shield he took, and on his helmet laced:"
10461,LXXV,
10462,LXXVI,LXXVI
10463,LXXVI,"And with a thousand knights and barons bold,"
10464,LXXVI,"Toward the town he hasted from his camp,"
10465,LXXVI,"In clouds of dust was Titan’s face enrolled,"
10466,LXXVI,"Trembled the earth whereon the worthies stamp,"
10467,LXXVI,"His foes far off his dreadful looks behold,"
10468,LXXVI,"Which in their hearts of courage quenched the lamp,"
10469,LXXVI,"A chilling fear ran cold through every vein,"
10470,LXXVI,Lord Godfrey shouted thrice and all his train:
10471,LXXVI,
10472,LXXVII,LXXVII
10473,LXXVII,"Their sovereign’s voice his hardy people knew,"
10474,LXXVII,And his loud cries that cheered each fearful heart;
10475,LXXVII,"Thereat new strength they took and courage new,"
10476,LXXVII,And to the fierce assault again they start.
10477,LXXVII,The Pagans twain this while themselves withdrew
10478,LXXVII,"Within the breach to save that battered part,"
10479,LXXVII,And with great loss a skirmish hot they hold
10480,LXXVII,Against Tancredi and his squadron bold.
10481,LXXVII,
10482,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
10483,LXXVIII,Thither came Godfrey armed round about
10484,LXXVIII,"In trusty plate, with fierce and dreadful look;"
10485,LXXVIII,At first approach against Argantes stout
10486,LXXVIII,"Headed with poignant steel a lance he shook,"
10487,LXXVIII,No casting engine with such force throws out
10488,LXXVIII,"A knotty spear, and as the way it took,"
10489,LXXVIII,"It whistled in the air, the fearless knight"
10490,LXXVIII,Opposed his shield against that weapon’s might.
10491,LXXVIII,
10492,LXXIX,LXXIX
10493,LXXIX,"The dreadful blow quite through his target drove,"
10494,LXXIX,"And bored through his breastplate strong and thick,"
10495,LXXIX,"The tender skin it in his bosom rove,"
10496,LXXIX,The purple-blood out-streamed from the quick;
10497,LXXIX,To wrest it out the wounded Pagan strove
10498,LXXIX,And little leisure gave it there to stick;
10499,LXXIX,"At Godfrey’s head the lance again he cast,"
10500,LXXIX,"And said, “Lo, there again thy dart thou hast.”"
10501,LXXIX,
10502,LXXX,LXXX
10503,LXXX,"The spear flew back the way it lately came,"
10504,LXXX,"And would revenge the harm itself had done,"
10505,LXXX,"But missed the mark whereat the man did aim,"
10506,LXXX,He stepped aside the furious blow to shun:
10507,LXXX,"But Sigiere in his throat received the same,"
10508,LXXX,"The murdering weapon at his neck out-run,"
10509,LXXX,"Nor aught it grieved the man to lose his breath,"
10510,LXXX,Since in his prince’s stead he suffered death.
10511,LXXX,
10512,LXXXI,LXXXI
10513,LXXXI,Even then the Soldan struck with monstrous main
10514,LXXXI,"The noble leader of the Norman band,"
10515,LXXXI,"He reeled awhile and staggered with the pain,"
10516,LXXXI,And wheeling round fell grovelling on the sand:
10517,LXXXI,Godfrey no longer could the grief sustain
10518,LXXXI,"Of these displeasures, but with flaming brand,"
10519,LXXXI,"Up to the breach in heat and haste he goes,"
10520,LXXXI,And hand to hand there combats with his foes;
10521,LXXXI,
10522,LXXXII,LXXXII
10523,LXXXII,"And there great wonders surely wrought he had,"
10524,LXXXII,"Mortal the fight, and fierce had been the fray,"
10525,LXXXII,"But that dark night, from her pavilion sad,"
10526,LXXXII,"Her cloudy wings did on the earth display,"
10527,LXXXII,Her quiet shades she interposed glad
10528,LXXXII,To cause the knights their arms aside to lay;
10529,LXXXII,"Godfrey withdrew, and to their tents they wend,"
10530,LXXXII,And thus this bloody day was brought to end.
10531,LXXXII,
10532,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
10533,LXXXIII,"The weak and wounded ere he left the field,"
10534,LXXXIII,"The godly duke to safety thence conveyed,"
10535,LXXXIII,"Nor to his foes his engines would he yield,"
10536,LXXXIII,In them his hope to win the fortress laid;
10537,LXXXIII,"Then to the tower he went, and it beheeld,"
10538,LXXXIII,The tower that late the Pagan lords dismayed
10539,LXXXIII,"But now stood bruised, broken, cracked and shivered,"
10540,LXXXIII,From some sharp storm as it were late delivered.
10541,LXXXIII,
10542,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
10543,LXXXIV,"From dangers great escaped, but late it was,"
10544,LXXXIV,"And now to safety brought well-nigh it seems,"
10545,LXXXIV,But as a ship that under sail doth pass
10546,LXXXIV,"The roaring billows and the raging streams,"
10547,LXXXIV,"And drawing nigh the wished port, alas,"
10548,LXXXIV,Breaks on some hidden rocks her ribs and beams;
10549,LXXXIV,"Or as a steed rough ways that well hath passed,"
10550,LXXXIV,Before his inn stumbleth and falls at last:
10551,LXXXIV,
10552,LXXXV,LXXXV
10553,LXXXV,"Such hap befell that tower, for on that side"
10554,LXXXV,"Gainst which the Pagans’ force and battery bend,"
10555,LXXXV,"Two wheels were broke whereon the piece should ride,"
10556,LXXXV,"The maimed engine could no further wend,"
10557,LXXXV,The troop that guarded it that part provide
10558,LXXXV,"To underprop with posts, and it defend"
10559,LXXXV,Till carpenters and cunning workmen came
10560,LXXXV,Whose skill should help and rear again the same.
10561,LXXXV,
10562,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
10563,LXXXVI,"Thus Godfrey bids, and that ere springing-day,"
10564,LXXXVI,"The cracks and bruises all amend they should,"
10565,LXXXVI,"Each open passage, and each privy way"
10566,LXXXVI,"About the piece, he kept with soldiers bold:"
10567,LXXXVI,"But the loud rumor, both of that they say,"
10568,LXXXVI,"And that they do, is heard within the hold,"
10569,LXXXVI,"A thousand lights about the tower they view,"
10570,LXXXVI,And what they wrought all night both saw and knew.

11204,LXII,"In purple blood, whereso they hit or light,"

11214,LXIII,"Of their first fierceness still the fury lasts,"
11215,LXIII,"Wherewith sustained, they to their tackling stood,"

11224,LXIV,"Her curious square, embossed with swelling gold,"
11225,LXIV,"Her knees grow weak, the pains of death she feels,"

11243,LXVI,"His heart relenting nigh in sunder rave,"
11244,LXVI,"With woful speech of that sweet creature,"
11245,LXVI,"So that his rage, his wrath, and anger died,"
11246,LXVI,And on his cheeks salt tears for ruth down slide.
11247,LXVI,
11248,LXVII,LXVII
11249,LXVII,With murmur loud down from the mountain’s side
11250,LXVII,"A little runnel tumbled near the place,"

11252,LXVII,"And quick returned to do that work of grace,"
11253,LXVII,"With trembling hands her beaver he untied,"
11254,LXVII,"Which done he saw, and seeing, knew her face,"
11255,LXVII,"And lost therewith his speech and moving quite,"

11257,LXVII,
11258,LXVIII,LXVIII
11259,LXVIII,"He died not, but all his strength unites,"

11261,LXVIII,"Bridling his grief, with water he requites"
11262,LXVIII,"The life that he bereft with iron hard,"
11263,LXVIII,"And while the sacred words the knight recites,"
11264,LXVIII,The nymph to heaven with joy herself prepared;
11265,LXVIII,"And as her life decays her joys increase,"
11266,LXVIII,"She smiled and said, “Farewell, I die in peace.”"

11272,LXIX,"Downward for pity bent both heaven and sun,"
11273,LXIX,"Her naked hand she gave the knight, in show"
11274,LXIX,"Of love and peace, her speech, alas, was done,"
11275,LXIX,"And thus the virgin fell on endless sleep,—"

11277,LXIX,
11278,LXX,LXX
11279,LXX,"But when he saw her gentle soul was went,"
11280,LXX,"His manly courage to relent began,"
11281,LXX,"Grief, sorrow, anguish, sadness, discontent,"
11282,LXX,"Free empire got and lordship on the man,"
11283,LXX,"His life within his heart they close up pent,"

11288,LXXI,LXXI
11289,LXXI,"And his weak sprite, to be unbodied"

11292,LXXI,"Had not a Christian squadron there arrived,"
11293,LXXI,"To seek fresh water thither haply led,"
11294,LXXI,"And found the princess dead, and him deprived"

11296,LXXI,"On live, nigh dead, for her himself had slain."
11297,LXXI,
11298,LXXII,LXXII
11299,LXXII,"Their guide far off the prince knew by his shield,"
11300,LXXII,"And thither hasted full of grief and fear,"
11301,LXXII,"Her dead, him seeming so, he there beheld,"
11302,LXXII,And for that strange mishap shed many a tear;
11303,LXXII,He would not leave the corpses fair in field
11304,LXXII,"For food to wolves, though she a Pagan were,"
11305,LXXII,"But in their arms the soldiers both uphent,"
11306,LXXII,And both lamenting brought to Tancred’s tent.
11307,LXXII,
11308,LXXIII,LXXIII
11309,LXXIII,"With those dear burdens to their camp they pass,"
11310,LXXIII,"Yet would not that dead seeming knight awake,"

11312,LXXIII,His feeble soul had not her flight yet take:
11313,LXXIII,"The other lay a still and heavy mass,"
11314,LXXIII,Her spirit had that earthen cage forsake;
11315,LXXIII,"Thus were they brought, and thus they placed were"
11316,LXXIII,"In sundry rooms, yet both adjoining near."
11317,LXXIII,
11318,LXXIV,LXXIV
11319,LXXIV,All skill and art his careful servants used
11320,LXXIV,"To life again their dying lord to bring,"

11322,LXXIV,"He felt their hands and heard their whispering,"
11323,LXXIV,"But how he thither came long time he mused,"
11324,LXXIV,His mind astonished was with everything;
11325,LXXIV,"He gazed about, his squires in fine he knew,"
11326,LXXIV,Then weak and woful thus his plaints out threw:

11328,LXXV,LXXV
11329,LXXV,"“What, live I yet?  and do I breathe and see"
11330,LXXV,Of this accursed day the hateful light?

11333,LXXV,"Ah, coward hand, afraid why should’st thou be;"
11334,LXXV,"Thou instrument of death, shame and despite,"
11335,LXXV,"Why should’st thou fear, with sharp and trenchant knife,"

11339,LXXVI,"“Pierce through this bosom, and my cruel heart"

11341,LXXVI,"But thou to slaughters vile which used art,"
11342,LXXVI,Think’st it were pity so to ease my pain:
11343,LXXVI,Of luckless love therefore in torments’ smart
11344,LXXVI,"A sad example must I still remain,"
11345,LXXVI,"A woful monster of unhappy love,"
11346,LXXVI,"Who still must live, lest death his comfort prove:"
11347,LXXVI,
11348,LXXVII,LXXVII
11349,LXXVII,"“Still must I live in anguish, grief, and care;"
11350,LXXVII,"Furies my guilty conscience that torment,"
11351,LXXVII,"The ugly shades, dark night, and troubled air"
11352,LXXVII,"In grisly forms her slaughter still present,"
11353,LXXVII,"Madness and death about my bed repair,"
11354,LXXVII,Hell gapeth wide to swallow up this tent;
11355,LXXVII,"Swift from myself I run, myself I fear,"
11356,LXXVII,Yet still my hell within myself I bear.

11362,LXXVIII,"Some beast hath torn her flesh and licked her blood,"
11363,LXXVIII,"Ah noble prey!  for savage beast unmeet,"
11364,LXXVIII,"Ah sweet!  too sweet, and far too precious food,"
11365,LXXVIII,"Ah, seely nymph!  whom night and darksome shade"
11366,LXXVIII,"To beasts, and me, far worse than beasts, betrayed."

11369,LXXIX,"“But where you be, if still you be, I wend"

11372,LXXIX,"And on her tender bowels made his feast,"
11373,LXXIX,"Let that fell monster me in pieces rend,"
11374,LXXIX,And deep entomb me in his hollow chest:
11375,LXXIX,"For where she buried is, there shall I have"

11828,XVIII,Their fearful thoughts present before their face;
11829,XVIII,"So feared they, and fled, yet wist not why,"
11830,XVIII,Nor what pursued them in that fearful chase.
11831,XVIII,"Except their fear perchance while thus they fled,"

11834,XIX,XIX
11835,XIX,"Swift to the camp they turned back dismayed,"
11836,XIX,"With words confused uncertain tales they told,"
11837,XIX,That all which heard them scorned what they said

11853,XX,
11854,XXI,XXI
11855,XXI,"When from the grove a fearful sound outbreaks,"
11856,XXI,"As if some earthquake hill and mountain tore,"
11857,XXI,"Wherein the southern wind a rumbling makes,"
11858,XXI,Or like sea waves against the scraggy shore;
11859,XXI,"There lions grumble, there hiss scaly snakes,"
11860,XXI,"There howl the wolves, the rugged bears there roar,"
11861,XXI,"There trumpets shrill are heard and thunders fell,"

11864,XXII,XXII
11865,XXII,Upon their faces pale well might you note
11866,XXII,"A thousand signs of heart-amating fear,"
11867,XXII,"Their reason gone, by no device they wot"
11868,XXII,"How to press nigh, or stay still where they were,"
11869,XXII,"Against that sudden dread their breasts which smote,"
11870,XXII,"Their courage weak no shield of proof could bear,"
11871,XXII,"At last they fled, and one than all more bold,"
11872,XXII,"Excused their flight, and thus the wonders told:"

11875,XXIII,"“My lord, not one of us there is, I grant,"

11878,XXIII,"There keeps his court great Dis infernal king,"
11879,XXIII,He hath a heart of hardened adamant

11884,XXIV,XXIV
11885,XXIV,"This said, Alcasto to his words gave heed,"
11886,XXIV,"Alcasto leader of the Switzers grim,"
11887,XXIV,"A man both void of wit and void of dreed,"
11888,XXIV,Who feared not loss of life nor loss of limb.
11889,XXIV,No savage beasts in deserts wild that feed
11890,XXIV,"Nor ugly monster could dishearten him,"
11891,XXIV,"Nor whirlwind, thunder, earthquake, storm, or aught"
11892,XXIV,That in this world is strange or fearful thought.

11894,XXV,XXV
11895,XXV,"He shook his head, and smiling thus gan say,"
11896,XXV,"“The hardiness have I that wood to fell,"
11897,XXV,And those proud trees low in the dust to lay
11898,XXV,Wherein such grisly fiends and monsters dwell;
11899,XXV,"No roaring ghost my courage can dismay,"
11900,XXV,"No shriek of birds, beast’s roar, or dragon’s yell;"
11901,XXV,"But through and through that forest will I wend,"
11902,XXV,Although to deepest hell the paths descend.”
11903,XXV,
11904,XXVI,XXVI
11905,XXVI,"Thus boasted he, and leave to go desired,"
11906,XXVI,"And forward went with joyful cheer and will,"
11907,XXVI,"He viewed the wood and those thick shades admired,"
11908,XXVI,He heard the wondrous noise and rumbling shrill;
11909,XXVI,"Yet not one foot the audacious man retired,"
11910,XXVI,"He scorned the peril, pressing forward still,"
11911,XXVI,"Till on the forest’s outmost marge he stepped,"
11912,XXVI,A flaming fire from entrance there him kept.
11913,XXVI,
11914,XXVII,XXVII
11915,XXVII,"The fire increased, and built a stately wall"
11916,XXVII,"Of burning coals, quick sparks, and embers hot,"
11917,XXVII,"And with bright flames the wood environed all,"
11918,XXVII,That there no tree nor twist Alcasto got;
11919,XXVII,"The higher stretched the flames seemed bulwarks tall,"
11920,XXVII,"Castles and turrets full of fiery shot,"
11921,XXVII,With slings and engines strong of every sort;—
11922,XXVII,What mortal wight durst scale so strange a fort?
11923,XXVII,
11924,XXVIII,XXVIII
11925,XXVIII,Oh what strange monsters on the battlement
11926,XXVIII,In loathsome forms stood to defend the place?
11927,XXVIII,"Their frowning looks upon the knight they bent,"
11928,XXVIII,"And threatened death with shot, with sword and mace:"
11929,XXVIII,"At last he fled, and though but slow he went,"
11930,XXVIII,As lions do whom jolly hunters chase;
11931,XXVIII,"Yet fled the man and with sad fear withdrew,"
11932,XXVIII,Though fear till then he never felt nor knew.
11933,XXVIII,
11934,XXIX,XXIX
11935,XXIX,"That he had fled long time he never wist,"
11936,XXIX,"But when far run he had discoverd it,"
11937,XXIX,"Himself for wonder with his hand he blist,"
11938,XXIX,"A bitter sorrow by the heart him bit,"
11939,XXIX,"Amazed, ashamed, disgraced, sad, silent, trist,"
11940,XXIX,"Alone he would all day in darkness sit,"
11941,XXIX,"Nor durst he look on man of worth or fame,"
11942,XXIX,"His pride late great, now greater made his shame."
11943,XXIX,
11944,XXX,XXX
11945,XXX,"Godfredo called him, but he found delays"
11946,XXX,"And causes why he should his cabin keep,"
11947,XXX,"At length perforce he comes, but naught he says,"
11948,XXX,Or talks like those that babble in their sleep.
11949,XXX,His shamefacedness to Godfrey plain bewrays
11950,XXX,"His flight, so does his sighs and sadness deep:"
11951,XXX,"Whereat amazed, “What chance is this?” quoth he."
11952,XXX,“These witchcrafts strange or nature’s wonders be.
11953,XXX,
11954,XXXI,XXXI
11955,XXXI,“But if his courage any champion move
11956,XXXI,"To try the hazard of this dreadful spring,"
11957,XXXI,"I give him leave the adventure great to prove,"
11958,XXXI,Some news he may report us of the thing:”
11959,XXXI,"This said, his lords attempt the charmed grove,"
11960,XXXI,"Yet nothing back but fear and flight they bring,"
11961,XXXI,"For them inforced with trembling to retire,"
11962,XXXI,"The sight, the sound, the monsters and the fire."
11963,XXXI,
11964,XXXII,XXXII
11965,XXXII,This happed when woful Tancred left his bed
11966,XXXII,"To lay in marble cold his mistress dear,"
11967,XXXII,"The lively color from his cheek was fled,"
11968,XXXII,His limbs were weak his helm or targe to bear;
11969,XXXII,"Nathless when need to high attempts him led,"
11970,XXXII,"No labor would he shun, no danger fear,"
11971,XXXII,"His valor, boldness, heart and courage brave,"
11972,XXXII,To his faint body strength and vigor gave.
11973,XXXII,
11974,XXXIII,XXXIII
11975,XXXIII,"To this exploit forth went the venturous knight,"
11976,XXXIII,"Fearless, yet heedful; silent, well advised,"
11977,XXXIII,"The terrors of that forest’s dreadful sight,"
11978,XXXIII,"Storms, earthquakes, thunders, cries, he all despised:"
11979,XXXIII,"He feared nothing, yet a motion light,"
11980,XXXIII,"That quickly vanished, in his heart arised"
11981,XXXIII,"When lo, between him and the charmed wood,"
11982,XXXIII,A fiery city high as heaven up stood.
11983,XXXIII,
11984,XXXIV,XXXIV
11985,XXXIV,"The knight stepped back and took a sudden pause,"
11986,XXXIV,"And to himself, “What help these arms?” quoth he,"
11987,XXXIV,"“If in this fire, or monster’s gaping jaws"
11988,XXXIV,"I headlong cast myself, what boots it me?"
11989,XXXIV,"For common profit, or my country’s cause,"
11990,XXXIV,To hazard life before me none should be:
11991,XXXIV,"But this exploit of no such weight I hold,"
11992,XXXIV,For it to lose a prince or champion bold.
11993,XXXIV,
11994,XXXV,XXXV
11995,XXXV,"But if I fly, what will the Pagans say?"
11996,XXXV,"If I retire, who shall cut down this spring?"
11997,XXXV,Godfredo will attempt it every day.
11998,XXXV,What if some other knight perform the thing?
11999,XXXV,These flames uprisen to forestall my way
12000,XXXV,Perchance more terror far than danger bring.
12001,XXXV,"But hap what shall;” this said, he forward stepped,"
12002,XXXV,"And through the fire, oh wondrous boldness, leapt!"
12003,XXXV,
12004,XXXVI,XXXVI
12005,XXXVI,"He bolted through, but neither warmth nor heat!"
12006,XXXVI,"He felt, nor sign of fire or scorching flame;"
12007,XXXVI,"Yet wist he not in his dismayed conceit,"
12008,XXXVI,If that were fire or no through which he came;
12009,XXXVI,"For at first touch vanished those monsters great,"
12010,XXXVI,And in their stead the clouds black night did frame
12011,XXXVI,And hideous storms and showers of hail and rain;
12012,XXXVI,Yet storms and tempests vanished straight again.
12013,XXXVI,
12014,XXXVII,XXXVII
12015,XXXVII,Amazed but not afraid the champion good
12016,XXXVII,"Stood still, but when the tempest passed he spied,"
12017,XXXVII,"He entered boldly that forbidden wood,"
12018,XXXVII,"And of the forest all the secrets eyed,"
12019,XXXVII,In all his walk no sprite or phantasm stood
12020,XXXVII,"That stopped his way or passage free denied,"
12021,XXXVII,"Save that the growing trees so thick were set,"
12022,XXXVII,"That oft his sight, and passage oft they let."
12023,XXXVII,
12024,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
12025,XXXVIII,"At length a fair and spacious green he spied,"
12026,XXXVIII,"Like calmest waters, plain, like velvet, soft,"
12027,XXXVIII,"Wherein a cypress clad in summer’s pride,"
12028,XXXVIII,"Pyramid-wise, lift up his tops aloft;"
12029,XXXVIII,"In whose smooth bark upon the evenest side,"
12030,XXXVIII,"Strange characters he found, and viewed them oft,"
12031,XXXVIII,Like those which priests of Egypt erst instead
12032,XXXVIII,"Of letters used, which none but they could read."
12033,XXXVIII,
12034,XXXIX,XXXIX
12035,XXXIX,"Mongst them he picked out these words at last,"
12036,XXXIX,"Writ in the Syriac tongue, which well he could,"
12037,XXXIX,"“Oh hardy knight, who through these woods hast passed:"
12038,XXXIX,Where Death his palace and his court doth hold!
12039,XXXIX,"Oh trouble not these souls in quiet placed,"
12040,XXXIX,"Oh be not cruel as thy heart is bold,"
12041,XXXIX,"Pardon these ghosts deprived of heavenly light,"
12042,XXXIX,With spirits dead why should men living fight?”

12048,XL,His blasts amid the leaves and branches knit
12049,XL,"And frame a sound like speech of human kind,"
12050,XL,"But full of sorrow grief and woe was it,"
12051,XL,Whereby his gentle thoughts all filled were
12052,XL,"With pity, sadness, grief, compassion, fear."
12053,XL,
12054,XLI,XLI
12055,XLI,"He drew his sword at last, and gave the tree"
12056,XLI,"A mighty blow, that made a gaping wound,"
12057,XLI,Out of the rift red streams he trickling see
12058,XLI,"That all bebled the verdant plain around,"
12059,XLI,"His hair start up, yet once again stroke he,"
12060,XLI,He nould give over till the end he found
12061,XLI,"Of this adventure, when with plaint and moan,"
12062,XLI,"As from some hollow grave, he heard one groan."
12063,XLI,
12064,XLII,XLII
12065,XLII,"“Enough, enough!” the voice lamenting said,"
12066,XLII,"“Tancred, thou hast me hurt, thou didst me drive"
12067,XLII,Out of the body of a noble maid
12068,XLII,"Who with me lived, whom late I kept on live,"
12069,XLII,"And now within this woful cypress laid,"
12070,XLII,"My tender rind thy weapon sharp doth rive,"
12071,XLII,"Cruel, is’t not enough thy foes to kill,"
12072,XLII,But in their graves wilt thou torment them still?

12074,XLIII,XLIII
12075,XLIII,"“I was Clorinda, now imprisoned here,"

12078,XLIII,"Before the city’s walls last day that fell,"
12079,XLIII,"In bodies new or graves I wot not clear,"
12080,XLIII,"But here they are confined by magic’s spell,"

12090,XLIV,So fearful is that wondrous form to view;
12091,XLIV,"So feared the knight, yet he both knew and thought"
12092,XLIV,All were illusions false by witchcraft wrought:

12104,XLVI,XLVI
12105,XLVI,"Thus his fierce heart which death had scorned oft,"
12106,XLVI,"Whom no strange shape or monster could dismay,"
12107,XLVI,"With feigned shows of tender love made soft,"
12108,XLVI,A spirit false did with vain plaints betray;
12109,XLVI,"A whirling wind his sword heaved up aloft,"
12110,XLVI,And through the forest bare it quite away.
12111,XLVI,"O’ercome retired the prince, and as he came,"
12112,XLVI,"His sword he found, and repossessed the same,"

12369,LXXII,"Upon the faithful host His gracious eye,"
12370,LXXII,"And in what pain and what distress it laid,"

12399,LXXV,That like a dark mirksome even it seems;
12400,LXXV,"The crashing rain from molten skies down fell,"
12401,LXXV,And o’er their banks the brooks and fountains swell.

12407,LXXVI,"With merry noise the promised showers attend,"
12408,LXXVI,And spreading broad their wings displayed lie
12409,LXXVI,"To keep the drops that on their plumes descend,"

12419,LXXVII,"In the fresh streams he dives his sweaty hands,"
12420,LXXVII,"Their faces some, and some their temples wet,"
12421,LXXVII,And some to keep the drops large vessels set.

12424,LXXVIII,"Nor man alone to ease his burning sore,"

12427,LXXVIII,"Whose solid limbs were cleft with rifts and chinks,"

12429,LXXVIII,"Of liquor sweet, that through her veins down sinks,"

12613,XV,"If I say truth, or if I love him, see."
12614,XV,"But say, what messengers shall for him go?"
12615,XV,"What shall their speeches, what their errand be?"

12734,XXVII,"This man was bold of courage, strong of hand,"
12735,XXVII,Guelpho was glad he did the proffer make:
12736,XXVII,"“Thou shalt,” quoth he, “Ubaldo shalt thou have"
12737,XXVII,"To go with thee, a knight, stout, wise, and grave.”"
12738,XXVII,
12739,XXVIII,XXVIII
12740,XXVIII,Ubaldo in his youth had known and seen
12741,XXVIII,"The fashions strange of many an uncouth land,"
12742,XXVIII,And travelled over all the realms between
12743,XXVIII,"The Arctic circle and hot Meroe’s strand,"
12744,XXVIII,"And as a man whose wit his guide had been,"
12745,XXVIII,"Their customs use he could, tongues understand,"

12753,XXIX,"Where Boemond doth his seat and sceptre hold,"
12754,XXIX,For public fame said that Bertoldo’s heir
12755,XXIX,"There lived, there dwelt, there stayed; the hermit old,"

12762,XXX,You follow but a rash and truthless guide
12763,XXX,That leads vain men amiss and makes them stray;
12764,XXX,"Near Ascalon go to the salt seaside,"
12765,XXX,"Where a swift brook fails in with hideous sway,"

12783,XXXII,"Whose broken shores with brackish waves are wet,"
12784,XXXII,"And there they heard how gainst the cliffs, besprent"
12785,XXXII,"With bitter foam, the roaring surges bet,"
12786,XXXII,"A tumbling brook their passage stopped and stayed,"

12793,XXXIII,"An aged sire, grave and benign in show,"
12794,XXXIII,"Crowned with a beechen garland gathered new,"
12795,XXXIII,"Clad in a linen robe that raught down low,"
12796,XXXIII,"In his right hand a rod, and on the flood"

12803,XXXIV,"With wanton windlays run, turn, play and pass;"
12804,XXXIV,"So on this river passed the wizard old,"
12805,XXXIV,"Although unfrozen soft and swift it was,"
12806,XXXIV,"And thither stalked where the warriors stayed,"
12807,XXXIV,"To whom, their greetings done, he spoke and said:"

12813,XXXV,"Imprisoned in a waste and desert land,"
12814,XXXV,"What soil remains by which you must not run,"

12816,XXXV,"Your search must stretch before the prince be found,"
12817,XXXV,"Beyond our world, beyond our half of ground!"
12818,XXXV,
12819,XXXVI,XXXVI
12820,XXXVI,"But yet vouchsafe to see my cell I pray,"

12823,XXXVI,"Things good for you to hear, and fit to know:”"
12824,XXXVI,"This said, he bids the river make them way,"
12825,XXXVI,"The flood retired, backward gan to flow,"
12826,XXXVI,"And here and there two crystal mountains rise,"
12827,XXXVI,"So fled the Red Sea once, and Jordan thrice."
12828,XXXVI,
12829,XXXVII,XXXVII
12830,XXXVII,"He took their hands, and led them headlong down"

12833,XXXVII,"Of thickest deserts feeble Cynthia peeps,"
12834,XXXVII,"Their spacious caves they saw all overflown,"
12835,XXXVII,"There all his waters pure great Neptune keeps,"

13133,LXVII,"To mitigate the rage of melting heat,"

13135,LXVII,Of that cold frost dissolve the hardness great

13143,LXVIII,"She framed a soft but surely holding chain,"
13144,LXVIII,Wherewith she bound his neck his hands and feet;
13145,LXVIII,"Thus bound, thus taken, did the prince remain,"
13146,LXVIII,"And in a coach which two old dragons drew,"
13147,LXVIII,"She laid the sleeping knight, and thence she flew:"

13150,LXIX,"“Nor turned she to Damascus’ kingdoms large,"

13153,LXIX,"And of her love ashamed, the way did take,"
13154,LXIX,To the wide ocean whither skiff or barge
13155,LXIX,"From us doth seld or never voyage make,"
13156,LXIX,"And there to frolic with her love awhile,"
13157,LXIX,"She chose a waste, a sole and desert isle."

13163,LXX,"A hill obscured with shades of forests old,"
13164,LXX,Upon whose sides the witch by art did frame
13165,LXX,"Continual snow, sharp frost and winter cold,"
13166,LXX,"But on the top, fresh, pleasant, sweet and green,"

13182,LXXII,"Her curled locks about her front are twined,"
13183,LXXII,A party-colored robe of silk she wears:
13184,LXXII,"This shall conduct you swift as air or wind,"
13185,LXXII,"Or that flit bird that Jove’s hot weapon bears,"
13186,LXXII,"A faithful pilot, cunning, trusty, sure,"

13234,LXXVII,"That he may glass therein his garments light,"
13235,LXXVII,"And wanton soft attire, and view his case,"
13236,LXXVII,That with the sight shame and disdain may move
13237,LXXVII,His heart to leave that base and servile love.

13486,XXII,"Now are they there, where first the sea brake in"
13487,XXII,"By great Alcides’ help, as stories feign,"
13488,XXII,True may it be that where those floods begin
13489,XXII,It whilom was a firm and solid main
13490,XXII,Before the sea there through did passage win
13491,XXII,"And parted Afric from the land of Spain,"
13492,XXII,"Abila hence, thence Calpe great upsprings,"

13499,XXIII,But fairly forward bore the knights her charge;
13500,XXIII,"Now through the strait her jolly ship made way,"
13501,XXIII,And boldly sailed upon the ocean large;
13502,XXIII,"But if the sea in midst of earth was great,"
13503,XXIII,"Oh what was this, wherein earth hath her seat?"
13504,XXIII,
13505,XXIV,XXIV
13506,XXIV,Now deep engulphed in the mighty flood
13507,XXIV,"They saw not Gades, nor the mountains near,"
13508,XXIV,"Fled was the land, and towns on land that stood,"
13509,XXIV,"Heaven covered sea, sea seemed the heavens to bear."
13510,XXIV,"“At last, fair lady,” quoth Ubaldo good,"
13511,XXIV,"“That in this endless main dost guide us here,"

13517,XXV,"The monsters fierce in Afric and in Spain,"
13518,XXV,"And all along your coasts and countries sailed,"
13519,XXV,"Yet durst he not assay the ocean main,"
13520,XXV,Within his pillars would he have impaled
13521,XXV,"The overdaring wit of mankind vain,"
13522,XXV,"Till Lord Ulysses did those bounders pass,"
13523,XXV,To see and know he so desirous was.

13526,XXVI,"“He passed those pillars, and in open wave"
13527,XXVI,"Of the broad sea first his bold sails untwined,"
13528,XXVI,"But yet the greedy ocean was his grave,"
13529,XXVI,Naught helped him his skill gainst tide and wind;
13530,XXVI,With him all witness of his voyage brave
13531,XXVI,"Lies buried there, no truth thereof we find,"
13532,XXVI,"And they whom storm hath forced that way since,"
13533,XXVI,"Are drowned all, or unreturned from thence:"
13534,XXVI,
13535,XXVII,XXVII
13536,XXVII,"“So that this mighty sea is yet unsought,"
13537,XXVII,"Where thousand isles and kingdoms lie unknown,"
13538,XXVII,"Not void of men as some have vainly thought,"
13539,XXVII,"But peopled well, and wonned like your own;"

13825,LVI,LVI
13826,LVI,"All which, united in the springing grass,"

13944,THE ARGUMENT.,"And do so much, that full of rage and spite,"
13945,THE ARGUMENT.,"With them he goes sad, shamed, discontent:"
13946,THE ARGUMENT.,With plaints and prayers to retain her knight
13947,THE ARGUMENT.,"Armida strives; he hears, but thence he went,"
13948,THE ARGUMENT.,And she forlorn her palace great and fair
13949,THE ARGUMENT.,"Destroys for grief, and flies thence through the air."
13950,THE ARGUMENT.,
13951,I,I
13952,I,"The palace great is builded rich and round,"
13953,I,And in the centre of the inmost hold
13954,I,"There lies a garden sweet, on fertile ground,"
13955,I,Fairer than that where grew the trees of gold:
13956,I,The cunning sprites had buildings reared around
13957,I,"With doors and entries false a thousandfold,"
13958,I,"A labyrinth they made that fortress brave,"
13959,I,"Like Daedal’s prison, or Porsenna’s grave."
13960,I,
13961,II,II
13962,II,"The knights passed through the castle’s largest gate,"
13963,II,"Though round about an hundred ports there shine,"
13964,II,"The door-leaves framed of carved silver-plate,"
13965,II,Upon their golden hinges turn and twine.
13966,II,They stayed to view this work of wit and state.
13967,II,"The workmanship excelled the substance fine,"
13968,II,"For all the shapes in that rich metal wrought,"
13969,II,"Save speech, of living bodies wanted naught."
13970,II,
13971,III,III
13972,III,"Alcides there sat telling tales, and spun"
13973,III,"Among the feeble troops of damsels mild,"
13974,III,He that the fiery gates of hell had won
13975,III,And heaven upheld; false Love stood by and smiled:
13976,III,"Armed with his club fair Iole forth run,"
13977,III,"His club with blood of monsters foul defiled,"
13978,III,"And on her back his lion’s skin had she,"
13979,III,Too rough a bark for such a tender tree.
13980,III,
13981,IV,IV
13982,IV,"Beyond was made a sea, whose azure flood"
13983,IV,"The hoary froth crushed from the surges blue,"
13984,IV,Wherein two navies great well ranged stood
13985,IV,"Of warlike ships, fire from their arms outflew,"
13986,IV,"The waters burned about their vessels good,"
13987,IV,"Such flames the gold therein enchased threw,"
13988,IV,"Caesar his Romans hence, the Asian kings"
13989,IV,Thence Antony and Indian princes brings.
13990,IV,
13991,V,V
13992,V,"The Cyclades seemed to swim amid the main,"
13993,V,"And hill gainst hill, and mount gainst mountain smote,"
13994,V,With such great fury met those armies twain;
13995,V,"Here burnt a ship, there sunk a bark or boat,"
13996,V,"Here darts and wild-fire flew, there drowned or slain"
13997,V,Of princes dead the bodies fleet and float;
13998,V,"Here Caesar wins, and yonder conquered been"
13999,V,"The Eastern ships, there fled the Egyptian queen:"
14000,V,
14001,VI,VI
14002,VI,"Antonius eke himself to flight betook,"
14003,VI,"The empire lost to which he would aspire,"
14004,VI,"Yet fled not he nor fight for fear forsook,"
14005,VI,"But followed her, drawn on by fond desire:"
14006,VI,"Well might you see within his troubled look,"
14007,VI,"Strive and contend, love, courage, shame and ire;"
14008,VI,"Oft looked he back, oft gazed he on the fight,"
14009,VI,But oftener on his mistress and her flight.
14010,VI,
14011,VII,VII
14012,VII,"Then in the secret creeks of fruitful Nile,"
14013,VII,"Cast in her lap, he would sad death await,"
14014,VII,And in the pleasure of her lovely smile
14015,VII,Sweeten the bitter stroke of cursed fate:
14016,VII,All this did art with curious hand compile
14017,VII,In the rich metal of that princely gate.
14018,VII,"The knights these stories viewed first and last,"
14019,VII,"Which seen, they forward pressed, and in they passed:"
14020,VII,
14021,VIII,VIII
14022,VIII,As through his channel crooked Meander glides
14023,VIII,"With turns and twines, and rolls now to, now fro,"
14024,VIII,Whose streams run forth there to the salt sea sides
14025,VIII,Here back return and to their springward go:
14026,VIII,"Such crooked paths, such ways this palace hides;"
14027,VIII,"Yet all the maze their map described so,"
14028,VIII,"That through the labyrinth they got in fine,"
14029,VIII,As Theseus did by Ariadne’s line.
14030,VIII,
14031,IX,IX
14032,IX,"When they had passed all those troubled ways,"
14033,IX,"The garden sweet spread forth her green to show,"
14034,IX,"The moving crystal from the fountains plays,"
14035,IX,"Fair trees, high plants, strange herbs and flowerets new,"
14036,IX,"Sunshiny hills, dales hid from Phoebus’ rays,"
14037,IX,"Groves, arbors, mossy caves, at once they view,"
14038,IX,"And that which beauty moat, most wonder brought,"
14039,IX,Nowhere appeared the art which all this wrought.
14040,IX,
14041,X,X
14042,X,So with the rude the polished mingled was
14043,X,"That natural seemed all and every part,"
14044,X,"Nature would craft in counterfeiting pass,"
14045,X,And imitate her imitator art:
14046,X,"Mild was the air, the skies were clear as glass,"
14047,X,"The trees no whirlwind felt, nor tempest smart,"
14048,X,"But ere the fruit drop off, the blossom comes,"
14049,X,"This springs, that falls, that ripeneth and this blooms."
14050,X,
14051,XI,XI
14052,XI,The leaves upon the self-same bough did hide
14053,XI,"Beside the young the old and ripened fig,"
14054,XI,"Here fruit was green, there ripe with vermeil side,"
14055,XI,"The apples new and old grew on one twig,"
14056,XI,The fruitful vine her arms spread high and wide
14057,XI,"That bended underneath their clusters big,"
14058,XI,"The grapes were tender here, hard, young and sour,"
14059,XI,"There purple ripe, and nectar sweet forth pour."
14060,XI,
14061,XII,XII
14062,XII,"The joyous birds, hid under greenwood shade,"
14063,XII,"Sung merry notes on every branch and bough,"
14064,XII,The wind that in the leaves and waters played
14065,XII,"With murmur sweet, now sung, and whistled now;"
14066,XII,"Ceased the birds, the wind loud answer made,"
14067,XII,"And while they sung, it rumbled soft and low;"
14068,XII,"Thus were it hap or cunning, chance or art,"
14069,XII,The wind in this strange music bore his part.
14070,XII,
14071,XIII,XIII
14072,XIII,"With party-colored plumes’ and purple bill,"
14073,XIII,"A wondrous bird among the rest there flew,"
14074,XIII,"That in plain speech sung love-lays loud and shrill,"
14075,XIII,Her leden was like human language true;
14076,XIII,"So much she talked, and with such wit and skill,"
14077,XIII,"That strange it seemed how much good she knew,"
14078,XIII,"Her feathered fellows all stood hush to hear,"
14079,XIII,"Dumb was the wind, the waters silent were."
14080,XIII,
14081,XIV,XIV
14082,XIV,"“The gently budding rose,” quoth she, “behold,"
14083,XIV,"That first scant peeping forth with virgin beams,"
14084,XIV,"Half ope, half shut, her beauties doth upfold"
14085,XIV,"In their dear leaves, and less seen, fairer seems,"
14086,XIV,"And after spreads them forth more broad and bold,"
14087,XIV,"Then languisheth and dies in last extremes,"
14088,XIV,"Nor seems the same, that decked bed and bower"
14089,XIV,"Of many a lady late, and paramour;"
14090,XIV,
14091,XV,XV
14092,XV,"“So, in the passing of a day, doth pass"
14093,XV,"The bud and blossom of the life of man,"
14094,XV,"Nor e’er doth flourish more, but like the grass"
14095,XV,"Cut down, becometh withered, pale and wan:"
14096,XV,Oh gather then the rose while time thou hast
14097,XV,"Short is the day, done when it scant began,"
14098,XV,"Gather the rose of love, while yet thou mayest,"
14099,XV,"Loving, be loved; embracing, be embraced.”"
14100,XV,
14101,XVI,XVI
14102,XVI,"He ceased, and as approving all he spoke,"
14103,XVI,"The choir of birds their heavenly tunes renew,"
14104,XVI,"The turtles sighed, and sighs with kisses broke,"
14105,XVI,The fowls to shades unseen by pairs withdrew;
14106,XVI,"It seemed the laurel chaste, and stubborn oak,"
14107,XVI,"And all the gentle trees on earth that grew,"
14108,XVI,"It seemed the land, the sea, and heaven above,"
14109,XVI,"All breathed out fancy sweet, and sighed out love."
14110,XVI,
14111,XVII,XVII
14112,XVII,"Through all this music rare, and strong consent"
14113,XVII,"Of strange allurements, sweet  bove mean and measure,"
14114,XVII,"Severe, firm, constant, still the knights forthwent,"
14115,XVII,"Hardening their hearts gainst false enticing pleasure,"
14116,XVII,"Twixt leaf and leaf their sight before they sent,"
14117,XVII,"And after crept themselves at ease and leisure,"
14118,XVII,"Till they beheld the queen, set with their knight"
14119,XVII,"Besides the lake, shaded with boughs from sight:"
14120,XVII,
14121,XVIII,XVIII
14122,XVIII,"Her breasts were naked, for the day was hot,"
14123,XVIII,Her locks unbound waved in the wanton wind;
14124,XVIII,"Some deal she sweat, tired with the game you wot,"
14125,XVIII,"Her sweat-drops bright, white, round, like pearls of Ind;"
14126,XVIII,Her humid eyes a fiery smile forthshot
14127,XVIII,"That like sunbeams in silver fountains shined,"
14128,XVIII,"O’er him her looks she hung, and her soft breast"
14129,XVIII,"The pillow was, where he and love took rest."
14130,XVIII,
14131,XIX,XIX
14132,XIX,"His hungry eyes upon her face he fed,"
14133,XIX,"And feeding them so, pined himself away;"
14134,XIX,"And she, declining often down her head,"
14135,XIX,"His lips, his cheeks, his eyes kissed, as he lay,"
14136,XIX,"Wherewith he sighed, as if his soul had fled"
14137,XIX,"From his frail breast to hers, and there would stay"
14138,XIX,With her beloved sprite: the armed pair
14139,XIX,These follies all beheld and this hot fare.
14140,XIX,
14141,XX,XX
14142,XX,Down by the lovers’ side there pendent was
14143,XX,"A crystal mirror, bright, pure, smooth, and neat,"
14144,XX,"He rose, and to his mistress held the glass,"
14145,XX,"A noble page, graced with that service great;"
14146,XX,"She, with glad looks, he with inflamed, alas,"
14147,XX,"Beauty and love beheld, both in one seat;"
14148,XX,"Yet them in sundry objects each espies,"
14149,XX,"She, in the glass, he saw them in her eyes:"
14150,XX,
14151,XXI,XXI
14152,XXI,"Her, to command; to serve, it pleased the knight;"
14153,XXI,"He proud of bondage; of her empire, she;"
14154,XXI,"“My dear,” he said, “that blessest with thy sight"
14155,XXI,"Even blessed angels, turn thine eyes to me,"
14156,XXI,For painted in my heart and portrayed right
14157,XXI,"Thy worth, thy beauties and perfections be,"
14158,XXI,"Of which the form; the shape and fashion best,"
14159,XXI,"Not in this glass is seen, but in my breast."
14160,XXI,
14161,XXII,XXII
14162,XXII,"“And if thou me disdain, yet be content"
14163,XXII,"At least so to behold thy lovely hue,"
14164,XXII,That while thereon thy looks are fixed and bent
14165,XXII,Thy happy eyes themselves may see and view;
14166,XXII,"So rare a shape no crystal can present,"
14167,XXII,No glass contain that heaven of beauties true;
14168,XXII,Oh let the skies thy worthy mirror be!
14169,XXII,And in dear stars try shape and image see.”
14170,XXII,
14171,XXIII,XXIII
14172,XXIII,"And with that word she smiled, and ne’ertheless"
14173,XXIII,"Her love-toys still she used, and pleasures bold!"
14174,XXIII,"Her hair, that done, she twisted up in tress,"
14175,XXIII,"And looser locks in silken laces rolled,"
14176,XXIII,"Her curles garlandwise she did up-dress,"
14177,XXIII,"Wherein, like rich enamel laid on gold,"
14178,XXIII,"The twisted flowers smiled, and her white breast"
14179,XXIII,The lilies there that spring with roses dressed.
14180,XXIII,
14181,XXIV,XXIV
14182,XXIV,The jolly peacock spreads not half so fair
14183,XXIV,The eyed feathers of his pompous train;
14184,XXIV,Nor golden Iris so bends in the air
14185,XXIV,"Her twenty-colored bow, through clouds of rain;"
14186,XXIV,"Yet all her ornaments, strange, rich and rare,"
14187,XXIV,"Her girdle did in price and beauty stain,"
14188,XXIV,"Nor that, with scorn, which Tuscan Guilla lost,"
14189,XXIV,"Igor Venus Ceston, could match this for cost."
14190,XXIV,
14191,XXV,XXV
14192,XXV,"Of mild denays, of tender scorns, of sweet"
14193,XXV,"Repulses, war, peace, hope, despair, joy, fear,"
14194,XXV,"Of smiles, jests, mirth, woe, grief, and sad regreet,"
14195,XXV,"Sighs, sorrows, tears, embracements, kisses dear,"
14196,XXV,"That mixed first by weight and measure meet,"
14197,XXV,"Then at an easy fire attempered were,"
14198,XXV,"This wondrous girdle did Armida frame,"
14199,XXV,"And, when she would be loved, wore the same."
14200,XXV,
14201,XXVI,XXVI
14202,XXVI,"But when her wooing fit was brought to end,"
14203,XXVI,"She congee took, kissed him, and went her way;"
14204,XXVI,For once she used every day to wend
14205,XXVI,"Bout her affairs, her spells and charms to say:"
14206,XXVI,"The youth remained, yet had no power to bend"
14207,XXVI,"One step from thence, but used there to stray"
14208,XXVI,"Mongst the sweet birds, through every walk and grove"
14209,XXVI,"Alone, save for an hermit false called Love."
14210,XXVI,
14211,XXVII,XXVII
14212,XXVII,And when the silence deep and friendly shade
14213,XXVII,"Recalled the lovers to their wonted sport,"
14214,XXVII,"In a fair room for pleasure built, they laid,"
14215,XXVII,And longest nights with joys made sweet and short.
14216,XXVII,"Now while the queen her household things surveyed,"
14217,XXVII,"And left her lord her garden and disport,"
14218,XXVII,The twain that hidden in the bushes were
14219,XXVII,Before the prince in glistering arms appear:
14220,XXVII,
14221,XXVIII,XXVIII
14222,XXVIII,As the fierce steed for age withdrawn from war
14223,XXVIII,"Wherein the glorious beast had always wone,"
14224,XXVIII,"That in vile rest from fight sequestered far,"
14225,XXVIII,"Feeds with the mares at large, his service done,"
14226,XXVIII,"If arms he see, or hear the trumpet’s jar,"
14227,XXVIII,"He neigheth loud and thither fast doth run,"
14228,XXVIII,"And wiseth on his back the armed knight,"
14229,XXVIII,"Longing for jousts, for tournament and fight:"
14230,XXVIII,
14231,XXIX,XXIX
14232,XXIX,So fared Rinaldo when the glorious light
14233,XXIX,"Of their bright harness glistered in his eyes,"
14234,XXIX,His noble sprite awaked at that sight
14235,XXIX,"His blood began to warm, his heart to rise,"
14236,XXIX,"Though, drunk with ease, devoid of wonted might"
14237,XXIX,On sleep till then his weakened virtue lies.
14238,XXIX,"Ubaldo forward stepped, and to him hield"
14239,XXIX,Of diamonds clear that pure and precious shield.
14240,XXIX,
14241,XXX,XXX
14242,XXX,"Upon the targe his looks amazed he bent,"
14243,XXX,"And therein all his wanton habit spied,"
14244,XXX,"His civet, balm, and perfumes redolent,"
14245,XXX,"How from his locks they smoked and mantle wide,"
14246,XXX,"His sword that many a Pagan stout had shent,"
14247,XXX,"Bewrapped with flowers, hung idly by his side,"
14248,XXX,So nicely decked that it seemed the knight
14249,XXX,Wore it for fashion’s sake but not for fight.
14250,XXX,
14251,XXXI,XXXI
14252,XXXI,"As when, from sleep and idle dreams abraid,"
14253,XXXI,A man awaked calls home his wits again;
14254,XXXI,"So in beholding his attire he played,"
14255,XXXI,"But yet to view himself could not sustain,"
14256,XXXI,"His looks he downward cast and naught he said,"
14257,XXXI,"Grieved, shamed, sad, he would have died fain,"
14258,XXXI,And oft he wished the earth or ocean wide
14259,XXXI,"Would swallow him, and so his errors hide."
14260,XXXI,
14261,XXXII,XXXII
14262,XXXII,"Ubaldo took the time, and thus begun,"
14263,XXXII,"“All Europe now and Asia be in war,"
14264,XXXII,"And all that Christ adore and fame have won,"
14265,XXXII,"In battle strong, in Syria fighting are;"
14266,XXXII,"But thee alone, Bertoldo’s noble son,"
14267,XXXII,"This little corner keeps, exiled far"
14268,XXXII,"From all the world, buried in sloth and shame,"
14269,XXXII,A carpet champion for a wanton dame.
14270,XXXII,
14271,XXXIII,XXXIII
14272,XXXIII,“What letharge hath in drowsiness up-penned
14273,XXXIII,Thy courage thus?  what sloth doth thee infect?
14274,XXXIII,"Up, up, our camp and Godfrey for thee send,"
14275,XXXIII,"Thee fortune, praise and victory expect,"
14276,XXXIII,"Come, fatal champion, bring to happy end"
14277,XXXIII,"This enterprise begun, all that sect"
14278,XXXIII,Which oft thou shaken hast to earth full low
14279,XXXIII,"With thy sharp brand strike down, kill, overthrow.”"
14280,XXXIII,
14281,XXXIV,XXXIV
14282,XXXIV,"This said, the noble infant stood a space"
14283,XXXIV,"Confused, speechless, senseless, ill-ashamed;"
14284,XXXIV,"But when that shame to just disdain gave place,"
14285,XXXIV,"To fierce disdain, from courage sprung untamed,"
14286,XXXIV,"Another redness blushed through his face,"
14287,XXXIV,"Whence worthy anger shone, displeasure flamed,"
14288,XXXIV,"His nice attire in scorn he rent and tore,"
14289,XXXIV,For of his bondage vile that witness bore;
14290,XXXIV,
14291,XXXV,XXXV
14292,XXXV,"That done, he hasted from the charmed fort,"
14293,XXXV,And through the maze passed with his searchers twain.
14294,XXXV,Armida of her mount and chiefest port
14295,XXXV,"Wondered to find the furious keeper slain,"
14296,XXXV,"Awhile she feared, but she knew in short,"
14297,XXXV,"That her dear lord was fled, then saw she plain,"
14298,XXXV,"Ah, woful sight!  how from her gates the man"
14299,XXXV,"In haste, in fear, in wrath, in anger ran."
14300,XXXV,
14301,XXXVI,XXXVI
14302,XXXVI,"“Whither, O cruel!  leavest thou me alone?”"
14303,XXXVI,"She would have cried, her grief her speeches stayed,"
14304,XXXVI,"So that her woful words are backward gone,"
14305,XXXVI,And in her heart a bitter echo made;
14306,XXXVI,"Poor soul, of greater skill than she was one"
14307,XXXVI,"Whose knowledge from her thus her joy conveyed,"
14308,XXXVI,"This wist she well, yet had desire to prove"
14309,XXXVI,"If art could keep, if charms recall her love."
14310,XXXVI,
14311,XXXVII,XXXVII
14312,XXXVII,"All what the witches of Thessalia land,"
14313,XXXVII,"With lips unpure yet ever said or spake,"
14314,XXXVII,"Words that could make heaven’s rolling circles stand,"
14315,XXXVII,"And draw the damned ghosts from Limbo lake,"
14316,XXXVII,"All well she knew, but yet no time she fand"
14317,XXXVII,"To use her knowledge or her charms to make,"
14318,XXXVII,"But left her arts, and forth she ran to prove"
14319,XXXVII,If single beauty were best charm for love.
14320,XXXVII,
14321,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
14322,XXXVIII,"She ran, nor of her honor took regard,"
14323,XXXVIII,Oh where be all her vaunts and triumphs now?
14324,XXXVIII,"Love’s empire great of late she made or marred,"
14325,XXXVIII,"To her his subjects humbly bend and bow,"
14326,XXXVIII,"And with her pride mixed was a scorn so hard,"
14327,XXXVIII,"That to be loved she loved, yet whilst they woo"
14328,XXXVIII,Her lovers all she hates; that pleased her will
14329,XXXVIII,"To conquer men, and conquered so, to kill."
14330,XXXVIII,
14331,XXXIX,XXXIX
14332,XXXIX,"But now herself disdained, abandoned,"
14333,XXXIX,"Ran after him; that from her fled in scorn,"
14334,XXXIX,And her despised beauty labored
14335,XXXIX,With humble plaints and prayers to adorn:
14336,XXXIX,"She ran and hasted after him that fled,"
14337,XXXIX,"Through frost and snow, through brier, bush and thorn,"
14338,XXXIX,"And sent her cries on message her before,"
14339,XXXIX,That reached not him till he had reached the shore.

14346,XL,"Hear my last words, no parting kiss of thee"
14347,XL,"I crave, for some more fit with thee to marry"
14348,XL,"Keep them, unkind; what fear’st thou if thou stay?"
14349,XL,"Thou may’st deny, as well as run away.”"
14350,XL,
14351,XLI,XLI

14749,V,"And grew so great, that over Asia’s lands"
14750,V,"And Lybia’s realms it stretched many a mile,"
14751,V,"From Syria’s coasts as far as Cirene sands,"
14752,V,"And southward passed gainst the course of Nile,"
14753,V,"Through the hot clime where burnt Syene stands,"
14754,V,"Hence bounded in with sandy deserts waste,"
14755,V,And thence with Euphrates’ rich flood embraced.
14756,V,
14757,VI,VI
14758,VI,"Maremma, myrrh and spices that doth bring,"
14759,VI,"And all the rich red sea it comprehends,"
14760,VI,"And to those lands, toward the morning spring"
14761,VI,"That lie beyond that gulf, it far extends;"
14762,VI,"Great is that empire, greater by the king"
14763,VI,"That rules it now, whose worth the land amends,"
14764,VI,"And makes more famous, lord thereof by blood,"
14765,VI,"By wisdom, valor, and all virtues good."
14766,VI,
14767,VII,VII
14768,VII,"With Turks and Persians war he oft did wage,"
14769,VII,"And oft he won, and sometimes lost the field,"
14770,VII,Nor could his adverse fortune aught assuage
14771,VII,"His valor’s heat or make his proud heart yield,"
14772,VII,"But when he grew unfit for war through age,"
14773,VII,He sheathed his sword and laid aside his shield:
14774,VII,"But yet his warlike mind he laid not down,"
14775,VII,"Nor his great thirst of rule, praise and renown,"
14776,VII,
14777,VIII,VIII
14778,VIII,But by his knights still cruel wars maintained.
14779,VIII,"So wise his words, so quick his wit appears,"
14780,VIII,"That of the kingdom large o’er which he reigned,"
14781,VIII,The charge seemed not too weighty for his years;
14782,VIII,His greatness Afric’s lesser kings constrained
14783,VIII,"To tremble at his name, all Ind him fears,"
14784,VIII,And other realms that would his friendship hold;
14785,VIII,"Some armed soldiers sent, some gifts, some gold."
14786,VIII,
14787,IX,IX
14788,IX,This mighty prince assembled had the flower
14789,IX,"Of all his realms, against the Frenchmen stout,"
14790,IX,"To break their rising empire and their power,"
14791,IX,Nor of sure conquest had he fear or doubt:
14792,IX,"To him Armida came, even at the hour"
14793,IX,"When in the plains, old Gaza’s walls without,"
14794,IX,The lords and leaders all their armies bring
14795,IX,"In battle-ray, mustered before their king."

14798,X,"He on his throne was set, to which on height"
14799,X,"Who clomb an hundred ivory stairs first told,"
14800,X,"Under a pentise wrought of silver bright,"
14801,X,And trod on carpets made of silk and gold;
14802,X,His robes were such as best beseemen might
14803,X,"A king, so great, so grave, so rich, so old,"
14804,X,And twined of sixty ells of lawn and more
14805,X,A turban strange adorned his tresses hoar.
14806,X,
14807,XI,XI
14808,XI,"His right hand did his precious sceptre wield,"
14809,XI,"His beard was gray, his looks severe and grave,"
14810,XI,"And from his eyes, not yet made dim with eild,"
14811,XI,"Sparkled his former worth and vigor brave,"
14812,XI,His gestures all the majesty upheild
14813,XI,"And state, as his old age and empire crave,"
14814,XI,"So Phidias carved, Apelles so, pardie,"
14815,XI,"Erst painted Jove, Jove thundering down from sky."
14816,XI,
14817,XII,XII
14818,XII,"On either side him stood a noble lord,"
14819,XII,Whereof the first held in his upright hand
14820,XII,Of severe justice the unpartial sword;
14821,XII,"The other bare the seal, and causes scanned,"
14822,XII,"Keeping his folk in peace and good accord,"
14823,XII,And termed was lord chancellor of the land;
14824,XII,"But marshal was the first, and used to lead"
14825,XII,"His armies forth to war, oft with good speed."
14826,XII,
14827,XIII,XIII
14828,XIII,"Of bold Circassians with their halberts long,"
14829,XIII,"About his throne his guards stood in a ring,"
14830,XIII,"All richly armed in gilden corslets strong,"
14831,XIII,And by their sides their crooked swords down hing:
14832,XIII,"Thus set, thus seated, his grave lords among,"
14833,XIII,"His hosts and armies great beheld the king,"
14834,XIII,"And every band as by his throne it went,"
14835,XIII,"Their ensigns low inclined, and arms down bent:"
14836,XIII,
14837,XIV,XIV
14838,XIV,"Their squadrons first the men of Egypt show,"
14839,XIV,"In four troops, and each his several guide,"
14840,XIV,"Of the high country two, two of the low"
14841,XIV,"Which Nile had won out of the salt seaside,"
14842,XIV,"His fertile slime first stopped the waters’ flow,"
14843,XIV,"Then hardened to firm land the plough to bide,"
14844,XIV,"So Egypt still increased, within far placed"
14845,XIV,That part is now where ships erst anchor cast.
14846,XIV,
14847,XV,XV
14848,XV,The foremost band the people were that dwelled
14849,XV,"In Alexandria’s rich and fertile plain,"
14850,XV,"Along the western shore, whence Nile expelled"
14851,XV,The greedy billows of the swelling main;
14852,XV,"Araspes was their guide, who more excelled"
14853,XV,"In wit and craft than strength or warlike pain,"
14854,XV,"To place an ambush close, or to devise"
14855,XV,"A treason false, was none so sly, so wise."
14856,XV,
14857,XVI,XVI
14858,XVI,The people next that gainst the morning rays
14859,XVI,"Along the coasts of Asia have their seat,"
14860,XVI,"Arontes led them, whom no warlike praise"
14861,XVI,"Ennobled, but high birth and titles great,"
14862,XVI,"His helm ne’er made him sweat in toilsome frays,"
14863,XVI,"Nor was his sleep e’er broke with trumpet’s threat,"
14864,XVI,But from soft ease to try the toil of fight
14865,XVI,His fond ambition brought this carpet knight.
14866,XVI,
14867,XVII,XVII
14868,XVII,"The third seemed not a troop or squadron small,"
14869,XVII,But an huge host; nor seemed it so much grain
14870,XVII,In Egypt grew as to sustain them all;
14871,XVII,"Yet from one town thereof came all that train,"
14872,XVII,"A town in people to huge shires equal,"
14873,XVII,"That did a thousand streets and more contain,"
14874,XVII,"Great Caire it hight, whose commons from each side"
14875,XVII,"Came swarming out to war, Campson their guide."
14876,XVII,
14877,XVIII,XVIII
14878,XVIII,Next under Gazel marched they that plough
14879,XVIII,The fertile lands above that town which lie
14880,XVIII,Up to the place where Nilus tumbling low
14881,XVIII,Falls from his second cataract from high;
14882,XVIII,"The Egyptians weaponed were with sword and bow,"
14883,XVIII,"No weight of helm or hauberk list they try,"
14884,XVIII,"And richly armed, in their strong foes no dreed"
14885,XVIII,Of death but great desire of spoil they breed.
14886,XVIII,
14887,XIX,XIX
14888,XIX,"The naked folk of Barca these succeed,"
14889,XIX,"Unarmed half, Alarcon led that band,"
14890,XIX,"That long in deserts lived, in extreme need,"
14891,XIX,On spoils and preys purchased by strength of hand.
14892,XIX,"To battle strong unfit, their king did lead"
14893,XIX,His army next brought from Zumara land.
14894,XIX,"Then he of Tripoli, for sudden fight"
14895,XIX,"And skirmish short, both ready, bold, and light."
14896,XIX,
14897,XX,XX
14898,XX,Two captains next brought forth their bands to show
14899,XX,"Whom Stony sent and Happy Araby,"
14900,XX,"Which never felt the cold of frost and snow,"
14901,XX,"Or force of burning heat, unless fame lie,"
14902,XX,"Where incense pure and all sweet odors grow,"
14903,XX,"Where the sole phoenix doth revive, not die,"
14904,XX,And midst the perfumes rich and flowerets brave
14905,XX,"Both birth and burial, cradle hath and grave."
14906,XX,
14907,XXI,XXI
14908,XXI,"Their clothes not rich, their garments were not gay,"
14909,XXI,"But weapons like the Egyptian troops they had,"
14910,XXI,"The Arabians next that have no certain stay,"
14911,XXI,"No house, no home, no mansion good or bad,"
14912,XXI,"But ever, as the Scythian hordes stray,"
14913,XXI,From place to place their wandering cities gad:
14914,XXI,"These have both voice and stature feminine,"
14915,XXI,"Hair long and black, black face, and fiery eyne."
14916,XXI,
14917,XXII,XXII
14918,XXII,"Long Indian canes, with iron armed, they bear,"
14919,XXII,"And as upon their nimble steeds they ride,"
14920,XXII,"Like a swift storm their speedy troops appear,"
14921,XXII,If winds so fast bring storms from heavens wide:
14922,XXII,By Syphax led the first Arabians were;
14923,XXII,"Aldine the second squadron had no guide,"
14924,XXII,"And Abiazar proud, brought to the fight"
14925,XXII,"The third, a thief, a murderer, not a knight."
14926,XXII,
14927,XXIII,XXIII
14928,XXIII,The islanders came then their prince before
14929,XXIII,"Whose lands Arabia’s gulf enclosed about,"
14930,XXIII,"Wherein they fish and gather oysters store,"
14931,XXIII,Whose shells great pearls rich and round pour out;
14932,XXIII,"The Red Sea sent with them from his left shore,"
14933,XXIII,Of negroes grim a black and ugly rout;
14934,XXIII,"These Agricalt and those Osmida brought,"
14935,XXIII,"A man that set law, faith and truth at naught."
14936,XXIII,
14937,XXIV,XXIV
14938,XXIV,"The Ethiops next which Meroe doth breed,"
14939,XXIV,"That sweet and gentle isle of Meroe,"
14940,XXIV,"Twixt Nile and Astrabore that far doth spread,"
14941,XXIV,"Where two religions are, and kingdoms three,"
14942,XXIV,"These Assimiro and Canario led,"
14943,XXIV,"Both kings, both Pagans, and both subjects be"
14944,XXIV,"To the great Caliph, but the third king kept"
14945,XXIV,"Christ’s sacred faith, nor to these wars outstepped."
14946,XXIV,
14947,XXV,XXV
14948,XXV,"After two kings, both subjects also, ride,"
14949,XXV,"And of two bands of archers had the charge,"
14950,XXV,The first Soldan of Ormus placed in the wide
14951,XXV,"Huge Persian Bay, a town rich, fair, and large:"
14952,XXV,"The last of Boecan, which at every tide"
14953,XXV,"The sea cuts off from Persia’s southern marge,"
14954,XXV,"And makes an isle; but when it ebbs again,"
14955,XXV,"The passage there is sandy, dry and plain."
14956,XXV,
14957,XXVI,XXVI
14958,XXVI,"Nor thee, great Altamore, in her chaste bed"
14959,XXVI,"Thy loving queen kept with her dear embrace,"
14960,XXVI,"She tore her locks, she smote her breast, and shed"
14961,XXVI,"Salt tears to make thee stay in that sweet place,"
14962,XXVI,"“Seem the rough seas more calm, cruel,” she said,"
14963,XXVI,“Than the mild looks of thy kind spouse’s face?
14964,XXVI,"Or is thy shield, with blood and dust defiled,"
14965,XXVI,A dearer armful than thy tender child?”
14966,XXVI,
14967,XXVII,XXVII
14968,XXVII,"This was the mighty king of Samarcand,"
14969,XXVII,"A captain wise, well skilled in feats of war,"
14970,XXVII,"In courage fierce, matchless for strength of hand,"
14971,XXVII,"Great was his praise, his force was noised far;"
14972,XXVII,"His worth right well the Frenchmen understand,"
14973,XXVII,By whom his virtues feared and loved are:
14974,XXVII,"His men were armed with helms and hauberks strong,"
14975,XXVII,And by their sides broad swords and maces hong.
14976,XXVII,
14977,XXVIII,XXVIII
14978,XXVIII,Then from the mansions bright of fresh Aurore
14979,XXVIII,"Adrastus came, the glorious king of Ind,"
14980,XXVIII,"A snake’s green skin spotted with black he wore,"
14981,XXVIII,"That was made rich by art and hard by kind,"
14982,XXVIII,"An elephant this furious giant bore,"
14983,XXVIII,"He fierce as fire, his mounture swift as wind;"
14984,XXVIII,"Much people brought he from his kingdoms wide,"
14985,XXVIII,"Twixt Indus, Ganges, and the salt seaside."
14986,XXVIII,
14987,XXIX,XXIX
14988,XXIX,"The king’s own troop come next, a chosen crew,"
14989,XXIX,"Of all the camp the strength, the crown, the flower,"
14990,XXIX,Wherein each soldier had with honors due
14991,XXIX,"Rewarded been, for service ere that hour;"
14992,XXIX,"Their arms were strong for need, and fair for show,"
14993,XXIX,"Upon fierce steeds well mounted rode this power,"
14994,XXIX,And heaven itself with the clear splendor shone
14995,XXIX,"Of their bright armor, purple, gold and stone."
14996,XXIX,
14997,XXX,XXX
14998,XXX,"Mongst these Alarco fierce, and Odemare"
14999,XXX,"The muster master was, and Hidraort,"
15000,XXX,"And Rimedon, whose rashness took no care"
15001,XXX,"To shun death’s bitter stroke, in field or fort,"
15002,XXX,"Tigranes, Rapold stem, the men that fare"
15003,XXX,"By sea, that robbed in each creek and port,"
15004,XXX,"Ormond, and Marlabust the Arabian named,"
15005,XXX,Because that land rebellious he reclaimed.

15007,XXXI,XXXI
15008,XXXI,"There Pirga, Arimon, Orindo are,"
15009,XXXI,"Brimarte the scaler, and with him Suifant"
15010,XXXI,The breaker of wild horses brought from far;
15011,XXXI,"Then the great wresteler strong Aridamant,"
15012,XXXI,"And Tisapherne, the thunderbolt of war,"
15013,XXXI,"Whom none surpassed, whom none to match durst vaunt"
15014,XXXI,"At tilt, at tourney, or in combat brave,"
15015,XXXI,"With spear or lance, with sword, with mace or glaive."
15016,XXXI,
15017,XXXII,XXXII
15018,XXXII,"A false Armenian did this squadron guide,"
15019,XXXII,That in his youth from Christ’s true faith and light
15020,XXXII,"To the blind lore of Paganism did slide,"
15021,XXXII,"That Clement late, now Emireno, hight;"
15022,XXXII,"Yet to his king he faithful was, and tried"
15023,XXXII,"True in all causes, his in wrong and right:"
15024,XXXII,"A cunning leader and a soldier bold,"
15025,XXXII,"For strength and courage, young; for wisdom, old."
15026,XXXII,
15027,XXXIII,XXXIII
15028,XXXIII,"When all these regiments were passed and gone,"

15031,XXXIII,"Her gown tucked up, and in her hand a bow;"
15032,XXXIII,"In her sweet face her new displeasures shone,"
15033,XXXIII,"Mixed with the native beauties there which grow,"
15034,XXXIII,And quickened so her looks that in sharp wise
15035,XXXIII,It seems she threats and yet her threats entice.
15036,XXXIII,
15037,XXXIV,XXXIV
15038,XXXIV,"Her chariot like Aurora’s glorious wain,"
15039,XXXIV,With carbuncles and jacinths glistered round:
15040,XXXIV,Her coachman guided with the golden rein
15041,XXXIV,"Four unicorns, by couples yoked and bound;"
15042,XXXIV,"Of squires and lovely ladies hundreds twain,"
15043,XXXIV,"Whose rattling quivers at their backs resound,"
15044,XXXIV,"On milk-white steeds, wait on the chariot bright,"
15045,XXXIV,"Their steeds to manage, ready; swift, to flight."
15046,XXXIV,
15047,XXXV,XXXV
15048,XXXV,"Followed her troop led forth by Aradin,"
15049,XXXV,"Which Hidraort from Syria’s kingdom sent,"
15050,XXXV,As when the new-born phoenix doth begin
15051,XXXV,"To fly to Ethiop-ward, at the fair bent"
15052,XXXV,Of her rich wings strange plumes and feathers thin
15053,XXXV,"Her crowns and chains with native gold besprent,"
15054,XXXV,The world amazed stands; and with her fly
15055,XXXV,"An host of wondering birds, that sing and cry:"
15056,XXXV,
15057,XXXVI,XXXVI
15058,XXXVI,"So passed Armida, looked on, gazed on, so,"
15059,XXXVI,"A wondrous dame in habit, gesture, face;"
15060,XXXVI,There lived no wight to love so great a foe
15061,XXXVI,"But wished and longed those beauties to embrace,"
15062,XXXVI,"Scant seen, with anger sullen, sad for woe,"
15063,XXXVI,"She conquered all the lords and knights in place,"
15064,XXXVI,"What would she do, her sorrows passed, think you,"
15065,XXXVI,"When her fair eyes, her looks and smiles shall woo?"
15066,XXXVI,
15067,XXXVII,XXXVII
15068,XXXVII,"She passed, the king commanded Emiren"
15069,XXXVII,"Of his rich throne to mount the lofty stage,"
15070,XXXVII,"To whom his host, his army, and his men,"
15071,XXXVII,"He would commit, now in his graver age."
15072,XXXVII,With stately grace the man approached then;
15073,XXXVII,His looks his coming honor did presage:
15074,XXXVII,"The guard asunder cleft and passage made,"
15075,XXXVII,"He to the throne up went, and there he stayed."
15076,XXXVII,
15077,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
15078,XXXVIII,"To earth he cast his eyes, and bent his knee:"
15079,XXXVIII,"To whom the king thus gan his will explain,"
15080,XXXVIII,"“To thee this sceptre, Emiren, to thee"
15081,XXXVIII,"These armies I commit, my place sustain"
15082,XXXVIII,"Mongst them, go set the king of Judah free,"
15083,XXXVIII,"And let the Frenchmen feel my just disdain,"
15084,XXXVIII,"Go meet them, conquer them, leave none alive;"
15085,XXXVIII,"Or those that scape from battle, bring captive.”"
15086,XXXVIII,
15087,XXXIX,XXXIX
15088,XXXIX,"Thus spake the tyrant, and the sceptre laid"
15089,XXXIX,With all his sovereign power upon the knight:
15090,XXXIX,"“I take this sceptre at your hand,” he said,"
15091,XXXIX,"“And with your happy fortune go to fight,"
15092,XXXIX,"And trust, my lord, in your great virtue’s aid"
15093,XXXIX,"To venge all Asia’s harms, her wrongs to right,"
15094,XXXIX,Nor e’er but victor will I see your face;
15095,XXXIX,"Our overthrow shall bring death, not disgrace."
15096,XXXIX,
15097,XL,XL
15098,XL,"“Heavens grant if evil, yet no mishap I dread,"

15101,XL,"Theirs be the conquest, and the danger mine;"
15102,XL,"And let them safe bring home their captain dead,"
15103,XL,Buried in pomp of triumph’s glorious shine.”
15104,XL,"He ceased, and then a murmur loud up went,"
15105,XL,With noise of joy and sound of instrument.
15106,XL,
15107,XLI,XLI
15108,XLI,"Amid the noise and shout uprose the king,"
15109,XLI,Environed with many a noble peer
15110,XLI,"That to his royal tent the monarch bring,"
15111,XLI,"And there he feasted them and made them cheer,"
15112,XLI,"To him and him he talked, and carved each thing,"
15113,XLI,"The greatest honored, meanest graced were;"
15114,XLI,"And while this mirth, this joy and feast doth last,"

15118,XLII,"But when the feast was done, she, that espied"
15119,XLII,"All eyes on her fair visage fixed and bent,"
15120,XLII,"And by new notes and certain signs described,"
15121,XLII,"How love’s empoisoned fire their entrails brent,"
15122,XLII,"Arose, and where the king sate in his pride,"
15123,XLII,"With stately pace and humble gestures, went;"
15124,XLII,And as she could in looks in voice she strove
15125,XLII,"Fierce, stern, bold, angry, and severe to prove."
15126,XLII,
15127,XLIII,XLIII
15128,XLIII,"“Great Emperor, behold me here,” she said."
15129,XLIII,"“For thee, my country, and my faith to fight,"
15130,XLIII,"A dame, a virgin, but a royal maid;"
15131,XLIII,"And worthy seems this war a princess hight,"
15132,XLIII,"For by the sword the sceptre is upstayed,"
15133,XLIII,"This hand can use them both with skill and might,"
15134,XLIII,"This hand of mine can strike, and at each blow"

15886,XX,"Which reaching out his stretched arms around,"
15887,XX,"All the large desert in his bosom held,"
15888,XX,And through the grove one channel passage found;
15889,XX,"That in the wood; in that, the forest dwelled:"
15890,XX,Trees clad the streams; streams green those trees aye made
15891,XX,And so exchanged their moisture and their shade.
15892,XX,
15893,XXI,XXI
15894,XXI,"The knight some way sought out the flood to pass,"
15895,XXI,"And as he sought, a wondrous bridge appeared,"
15896,XXI,"A bridge of gold, a huge and weighty mass,"
15897,XXI,On arches great of that rich metal reared;
15898,XXI,"When through that golden way he entered was,"
15899,XXI,"Down fell the bridge, swelled the stream, and weared"
15900,XXI,"The work away, nor sign left where it stood,"
15901,XXI,And of a river calm became a flood.
15902,XXI,
15903,XXII,XXII
15904,XXII,"He turned, amazed to see it troubled so,"
15905,XXII,"Like sudden brooks increased with molten snow,"
15906,XXII,"The billows fierce that tossed to and fro,"
15907,XXII,The whirlpools sucked down to their bosoms low;
15908,XXII,"But on he went to search for wonders mo,"
15909,XXII,"Through the thick trees there high and broad which grow,"
15910,XXII,"And in that forest huge and desert wide,"
15911,XXII,"The more he sought, more wonders still he spied."
15912,XXII,
15913,XXIII,XXIII
15914,XXIII,"Whereso he stepped, it seemed the joyful ground"
15915,XXIII,"Renewed the verdure of her flowery weed,"
15916,XXIII,"A fountain here, a wellspring there he found;"
15917,XXIII,"Here bud the roses, there the lilies spread"
15918,XXIII,The aged wood o’er and about him round
15919,XXIII,"Flourished with blossoms new, new leaves, new seed,"
15920,XXIII,"And on the boughs and branches of those treen,"
15921,XXIII,"The bark was softened, and renewed the green."
15922,XXIII,
15923,XXIV,XXIV
15924,XXIV,"The manna on each leaf did pearled lie,"
15925,XXIV,The honey stilled from the tender rind;
15926,XXIV,"Again he heard that wondrous harmony,"
15927,XXIV,"Of songs and sweet complaints of lovers kind,"
15928,XXIV,"The human voices sung a triple high,"
15929,XXIV,"To which respond the birds, the streams, the wind,"
15930,XXIV,"But yet unseen those nymphs, those singers were,"
15931,XXIV,"Unseen the lutes, harps, viols which they bear."
15932,XXIV,

15934,XXV,"He looked, he listened, yet his thoughts denied"
15935,XXV,"To think that true which he both heard and see,"
15936,XXV,"A myrtle in an ample plain he spied,"
15937,XXV,And thither by a beaten path went he:
15938,XXV,"The myrtle spread her mighty branches wide,"
15939,XXV,Higher than pine or palm or cypress tree:
15940,XXV,And far above all other plants was seen
15941,XXV,That forest’s lady and that desert’s queen.
15942,XXV,
15943,XXVI,XXVI
15944,XXVI,"Upon the trees his eyes Rinaldo bent,"
15945,XXVI,And there a marvel great and strange began;
15946,XXVI,"An aged oak beside him cleft and rent,"
15947,XXVI,"And from his fertile hollow womb forth ran,"
15948,XXVI,"Clad in rare weeds and strange habiliment,"
15949,XXVI,"A nymph, for age able to go to man,"
15950,XXVI,"An hundred plants beside, even in his sight,"
15951,XXVI,"Childed an hundred nymphs, so great, so dight."
15952,XXVI,
15953,XXVII,XXVII
15954,XXVII,"Such as on stages play, such as we see"
15955,XXVII,"The Dryads painted whom wild Satyrs love,"
15956,XXVII,"Whose arms half-naked, locks untrussed be,"
15957,XXVII,"With buskins laced on their legs above,"
15958,XXVII,And silken robes tucked short above their knee;
15959,XXVII,"Such seemed the sylvan daughters of this grove,"
15960,XXVII,"Save that instead of shafts and boughs of tree,"
15961,XXVII,"She bore a lute, a harp, or cittern she."
15962,XXVII,
15963,XXVIII,XXVIII
15964,XXVIII,"And wantonly they cast them in a ring,"
15965,XXVIII,"And sung and danced to move his weaker sense,"
15966,XXVIII,"Rinaldo round about environing,"
15967,XXVIII,As centres are with their circumference;
15968,XXVIII,"The tree they compassed eke, and gan to sing,"
15969,XXVIII,That woods and streams admired their excellence;
15970,XXVIII,"“Welcome, dear lord, welcome to this sweet grove,"
15971,XXVIII,"Welcome our lady’s hope, welcome her love."
15972,XXVIII,
15973,XXIX,XXIX
15974,XXIX,"“Thou com’st to cure our princess, faint and sick"
15975,XXIX,"For love, for love of thee, faint, sick, distressed;"
15976,XXIX,"Late black, late dreadful was this forest thick,"
15977,XXIX,"Fit dwelling for sad folk with grief oppressed,"
15978,XXIX,See with thy coming how the branches quick
15979,XXIX,"Revived are, and in new blosoms dressed:”"
15980,XXIX,"This was their song, and after, from it went"
15981,XXIX,"First a sweet sound, and then the myrtle rent."
15982,XXIX,
15983,XXX,XXX
15984,XXX,If antique times admired Silenus old
15985,XXX,"That oft appeared set on his lazy ass,"
15986,XXX,How would they wonder if they had behold
15987,XXX,Such sights as from the myrtle high did pass?
15988,XXX,"Thence came a lady fair with locks of gold,"
15989,XXX,"That like in shape, in face and beauty was"
15990,XXX,To sweet Armide; Rinaldo thinks he spies
15991,XXX,"Her gestures, smiles, and glances of her eyes."
15992,XXX,
15993,XXXI,XXXI
15994,XXXI,"On him a sad and smiling look she cast,"
15995,XXXI,Which twenty passions strange at once bewrays:
15996,XXXI,"“And art thou come,” quoth she, “returned at last"
15997,XXXI,To her from whom but late thou ran’st thy ways?
15998,XXXI,Com’st thou to comfort me for sorrows past?
15999,XXXI,To ease my widow nights and careful days?
16000,XXXI,Or comest thou to work me grief and harm?
16001,XXXI,Why nilt thou speak?—why not thy face disarm?
16002,XXXI,
16003,XXXII,XXXII
16004,XXXII,“Com’st thou a friend or foe? I did not frame
16005,XXXII,"That golden bridge to entertain my foe,"
16006,XXXII,"Nor opened flowers and fountains as you came,"
16007,XXXII,To welcome him with joy that brings me woe:
16008,XXXII,"Put off thy helm, rejoice me with the flame"
16009,XXXII,"Of thy bright eyes, whence first my fires did grow."
16010,XXXII,"Kiss me, embrace me, if you further venture,"
16011,XXXII,"Love keeps the gate, the fort is eath to enter.”"
16012,XXXII,
16013,XXXIII,XXXIII
16014,XXXIII,Thus as she woos she rolls her rueful eyes
16015,XXXIII,"With piteous look, and changeth oft her cheer,"
16016,XXXIII,"An hundred sighs from her false heart upflies,"
16017,XXXIII,"She sobs, she mourns, it is great ruth to hear;"
16018,XXXIII,"The hardest breast sweet pity mollifies,"
16019,XXXIII,What stony heart resists a woman’s tear?
16020,XXXIII,"But yet the knight, wise, wary, not unkind,"
16021,XXXIII,Drew forth his sword and from her careless twined.
16022,XXXIII,
16023,XXXIV,XXXIV
16024,XXXIV,"Toward the tree he marched, she thither start,"
16025,XXXIV,"Before him stepped, embraced the plant and cried,"
16026,XXXIV,"“Ah, never do me such a spiteful part,"
16027,XXXIV,"To cut my tree, this forest’s joy and pride,"
16028,XXXIV,"Put up thy sword, else pierce therewith the heart"
16029,XXXIV,Of thy forsaken and despised Armide;
16030,XXXIV,"For through this breast, and through this heart unkind"
16031,XXXIV,To this fair tree thy sword shall passage find.”
16032,XXXIV,
16033,XXXV,XXXV
16034,XXXV,"He lift his brand, nor cared though oft she prayed,"
16035,XXXV,And she her form to other shape did change;
16036,XXXV,Such monsters huge when men in dreams are laid
16037,XXXV,Oft in their idle fancies roam and range:
16038,XXXV,"Her body swelled, her face obscure was made,"
16039,XXXV,"Vanished her garments, her face and vestures strange,"
16040,XXXV,"A giantess before him high she stands,"
16041,XXXV,Like Briareus armed with an hundred hands.
16042,XXXV,
16043,XXXVI,XXXVI
16044,XXXVI,"With fifty swords, and fifty targets bright,"
16045,XXXVI,"She threatened death, she roared, cried and fought,"
16046,XXXVI,"Each other nymph in armor likewise dight,"
16047,XXXVI,"A Cyclops great became: he feared them naught,"
16048,XXXVI,"But on the myrtle smote with all his might,"
16049,XXXVI,"That groaned like living souls to death nigh brought,"
16050,XXXVI,"The sky seemed Pluto’s court, the air seemed hell,"
16051,XXXVI,"Therein such monsters roar, such spirits yell."
16052,XXXVI,
16053,XXXVII,XXXVII
16054,XXXVII,"Lightened the heavens above, the earth below"
16055,XXXVII,"Roared loud, that thundered, and this shook;"
16056,XXXVII,"Blustered the tempests strong, the whirlwinds blow,"
16057,XXXVII,The bitter storm drove hailstones in his look;
16058,XXXVII,"But yet his arm grew neither weak nor slow,"
16059,XXXVII,"Nor of that fury heed or care he took,"
16060,XXXVII,Till low to earth the wounded tree down bended;
16061,XXXVII,"Then fled the spirits all, the charms all ended."
16062,XXXVII,
16063,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
16064,XXXVIII,"The heavens grew clear, the air waxed calm and still,"
16065,XXXVIII,"The wood returned to his wonted state,"
16066,XXXVIII,"Of withcrafts free, quite void of spirits ill;"
16067,XXXVIII,"Of horror full, but horror there innate;"
16068,XXXVIII,He further proved if aught withstood his will
16069,XXXVIII,"To cut those trees as did the charms of late,"
16070,XXXVIII,"And finding naught to stop him, smiled, and said,"
16071,XXXVIII,"“O shadows vain!  O fools, of shades afraid!”"
16072,XXXVIII,
16073,XXXIX,XXXIX
16074,XXXIX,"From thence home to the campward turned the knight,"
16075,XXXIX,"The hermit cried, upstarting from his seat,"
16076,XXXIX,"“Now of the wood the charms have lost their might,"
16077,XXXIX,"The sprites are conquered, ended is the feat,"
16078,XXXIX,See where he comes!”  In glistering white all dight
16079,XXXIX,"Appeared the man, bold, stately, high and great,"
16080,XXXIX,His eagle’s silver wings to shine begun
16081,XXXIX,With wondrous splendor gainst the golden sun.
16082,XXXIX,
16083,XL,XL
16084,XL,"The camp received him with a joyful cry,"
16085,XL,A cry the dales and hills about that flied;
16086,XL,"Then Godfrey welcomed him with honors high,"
16087,XL,"His glory quenched all spite, all envy killed:"
16088,XL,"“To yonder dreadful grove,” quoth he, “went I,"
16089,XL,"And from the fearful wood, as me you willed,"
16090,XL,"Have driven the sprites away, thither let be"
16091,XL,"Your people sent, the way is safe and free.”"
16092,XL,
16093,XLI,XLI
16094,XLI,"Sent were the workmen thither, thence they brought"
16095,XLI,"Timber enough, by good advice select,"
16096,XLI,And though by skilless builders framed and wrought
16097,XLI,"Their engines rude and rams were late elect,"
16098,XLI,Yet now the forts and towers from whence they fought
16099,XLI,"Were framed by a cunning architect,"
16100,XLI,"William, of all the Genoese lord and guide,"
16101,XLI,Which late ruled all the seas from side to side;
16102,XLI,
16103,XLII,XLII
16104,XLII,"But forced to retire from him at last,"
16105,XLII,"The Pagan fleet the seas moist empire won,"
16106,XLII,His men with all their stuff and store in haste
16107,XLII,"Home to the camp with their commander run,"
16108,XLII,"In skill, in wit, in cunning him surpassed"
16109,XLII,"Yet never engineer beneath the sun,"
16110,XLII,"Of carpenters an hundred large he brought,"
16111,XLII,That what their lord devised made and wrought.
16112,XLII,
16113,XLIII,XLIII
16114,XLIII,"This man began with wondrous art to make,"
16115,XLIII,"Not rams, not mighty brakes, not slings alone,"
16116,XLIII,"Wherewith the firm and solid walls to shake,"
16117,XLIII,"To cast a dart, or throw a shaft or stone;"
16118,XLIII,"But framed of pines and firs, did undertake"
16119,XLIII,"To build a fortress huge, to which was none"
16120,XLIII,"Yet ever like, whereof he clothed the sides"
16121,XLIII,Against the balls of fire with raw bull’s hides.
16122,XLIII,
16123,XLIV,XLIV
16124,XLIV,"In mortices and sockets framed just,"
16125,XLIV,"The beams, the studs and puncheons joined he fast;"
16126,XLIV,"To beat the city’s wall, beneath forth brust"
16127,XLIV,"A ram with horned front, about her waist"
16128,XLIV,"A bridge the engine from her side out thrust,"
16129,XLIV,Which on the wall when need she cast;
16130,XLIV,"And from her top a turret small up stood,"
16131,XLIV,"Strong, surely armed, and builded of like wood."
16132,XLIV,
16133,XLV,XLV
16134,XLV,"Set on an hundred wheels the rolling mass,"
16135,XLV,"On the smooth lands went nimbly up and down,"
16136,XLV,"Though full of arms and armed men it was,"
16137,XLV,"Yet with small pains it ran, as it had flown:"
16138,XLV,"Wondered the camp so quick to see it pass,"
16139,XLV,"They praised the workmen and their skill unknown,"
16140,XLV,"And on that day two towers they builded more,"
16141,XLV,Like that which sweet Clorinda burned before.
16142,XLV,
16143,XLVI,XLVI
16144,XLVI,Yet wholly were not from the Saracines
16145,XLVI,"Their works concealed and their labors hid,"
16146,XLVI,Upon that wall which next the camp confines
16147,XLVI,"They placed spies, who marked all they did:"
16148,XLVI,"They saw the ashes wild and squared pines,"
16149,XLVI,"How to the tents, trailed from the grove, they slid:"
16150,XLVI,"And engines huge they saw, yet could not tell"
16151,XLVI,"How they were built, their forms they saw not well."
16152,XLVI,
16153,XLVII,XLVII
16154,XLVII,"Their engines eke they reared, and with great art"
16155,XLVII,"Repaired each bulwark, turret, port and tower,"
16156,XLVII,"And fortified the plain and easy part,"
16157,XLVII,"To bide the storm of every warlike stoure,"
16158,XLVII,Till as they thought no sleight or force of Mart
16159,XLVII,To undermine or scale the same had power;
16160,XLVII,And false Ismeno gan new balls prepare
16161,XLVII,"Of wicked fire, wild, wondrous, strange and rare."
16162,XLVII,
16163,XLVIII,XLVIII
16164,XLVIII,He mingled brimstone with bitumen fell
16165,XLVIII,"Fetched from that lake where Sodom erst did sink,"
16166,XLVIII,And from that flood which nine times compassed hell
16167,XLVIII,"Some of the liquor hot he brought, I think,"
16168,XLVIII,"Wherewith the quenchless fire he tempered well,"
16169,XLVIII,To make it smoke and flame and deadly stink:
16170,XLVIII,"And for his wood cut down, the aged sire"
16171,XLVIII,Would thus revengement take with flame and fire.
16172,XLVIII,
16173,XLIX,XLIX
16174,XLIX,"While thus the camp, and thus the town were bent,"
16175,XLIX,"These to assault, these to defend the wall,"
16176,XLIX,"A speedy dove through the clear welkin went,"
16177,XLIX,"Straight o’er the tents, seen by the soldiers all;"
16178,XLIX,"With nimble fans the yielding air she rent,"
16179,XLIX,"Nor seemed it that she would alight or fall,"
16180,XLIX,"Till she arrived near that besieged town,"
16181,XLIX,Then from the clouds at last she stooped down:
16182,XLIX,
16183,L,L
16184,L,"But lo, from whence I nolt, a falcon came,"
16185,L,"Armed with crooked bill and talons long,"
16186,L,"And  twixt the camp and city crossed her game,"
16187,L,That durst nor bide her foe’s encounter strong;
16188,L,"But right upon the royal tent down came,"
16189,L,"And there, the lords and princes great among,"
16190,L,When the sharp hawk nigh touched her tender head
16191,L,"In Godfrey’s lap she fell, with fear half dead:"
16192,L,
16193,LI,LI
16194,LI,"The duke received her, saved her, and spied,"
16195,LI,"As he beheld the bird, a wondrous thing,"
16196,LI,"About her neck a letter close was tied,"
16197,LI,"By a small thread, and thrust under her wing,"
16198,LI,"He loosed forth the writ and spread it wide,"
16199,LI,"And read the intent thereof, “To Judah’s king,”"
16200,LI,"Thus said the schedule, “honors high increase,"
16201,LI,The Egyptian chieftain wisheth health and peace:
16202,LI,
16203,LII,LII
16204,LII,"“Fear not, renowned prince, resist, endure"
16205,LII,"Till the third day, or till the fourth at most,"
16206,LII,"I come, and your deliverance will procure,"
16207,LII,And kill your coward foes and all their host.”
16208,LII,"This secret in that brief was closed up sure,"
16209,LII,"Writ in strange language, to the winged post"
16210,LII,Given to transport; for in their warlike need
16211,LII,"The east such message used, oft with good speed."
16212,LII,
16213,LIII,LIII
16214,LIII,"The duke let go the captive dove at large,"
16215,LIII,"And she that had his counsel close betrayed,"
16216,LIII,"Traitress to her great Lord, touched not the marge"
16217,LIII,"Of Salem’s town, but fled far thence afraid."
16218,LIII,The duke before all those which had or charge
16219,LIII,"Or office high, the letter read, and said:"
16220,LIII,“See how the goodness of the Lord foreshows
16221,LIII,The secret purpose of our crafty foes.
16222,LIII,
16223,LIV,LIV
16224,LIV,"“No longer then let us protract the time,"
16225,LIV,"But scale the bulwark of this fortress high,"
16226,LIV,Through sweat and labor gainst those rocks sublime
16227,LIV,"Let us ascend, which to the southward lie;"
16228,LIV,"Hard will it be that way in arms to climb,"
16229,LIV,"But yet the place and passage both know I,"
16230,LIV,"And that high wall by site strong on that part,"
16231,LIV,"Is least defenced by arms, by work and art."
16232,LIV,
16233,LV,LV
16234,LV,"“Thou, Raymond, on this side with all thy might"
16235,LV,"Assault the wall, and by those crags ascend,"
16236,LV,My squadrons with mine engines huge shall fight
16237,LV,"And gainst the northern gate my puissance bend,"
16238,LV,"That so our foes, beguiled with the sight,"
16239,LV,"Our greatest force and power shall there attend,"
16240,LV,"While my great tower from thence shall nimbly slide,"
16241,LV,And batter down some worse defended side;
16242,LV,
16243,LVI,LVI
16244,LVI,"“Camillo, thou not far from me shalt rear"
16245,LVI,"Another tower, close to the walls ybrought.”"
16246,LVI,"This spoken, Raymond old, that sate him near,"
16247,LVI,"And while he talked great things tossed in his thought,"
16248,LVI,"Said, “To Godfredo’s counsel, given us here,"
16249,LVI,"Naught can be added, from it taken naught:"
16250,LVI,"Yet this I further wish, that some were sent"
16251,LVI,"To spy their camp, their secret and intent,"
16252,LVI,
16253,LVII,LVII
16254,LVII,“That may their number and their squadrons brave
16255,LVII,"Describe, and through their tents disguised mask.”"
16256,LVII,"Quoth Tancred, “Lo, a subtle squire I have,"
16257,LVII,"A person fit to undertake this task,"
16258,LVII,"A man quick, ready, bold, sly to deceive,"
16259,LVII,"To answer, wise, and well advised to ask;"
16260,LVII,"Well languaged, and that with time and place,"
16261,LVII,"Can change his look, his voice, his gait, his grace.”"
16262,LVII,
16263,LVIII,LVIII
16264,LVIII,"Sent for, he came, and when his lord him told"
16265,LVIII,"What Godfrey’s pleasure was and what his own,"
16266,LVIII,He smiled and said forthwith he gladly would.
16267,LVIII,"“I go,” quoth he, “careless what chance be thrown,"
16268,LVIII,"And where encamped be these Pagans bold,"
16269,LVIII,"Will walk in every tent a spy unknown,"
16270,LVIII,"Their camp even at noon-day I enter shall,"
16271,LVIII,And number all their horse and footmen all;
16272,LVIII,
16273,LIX,LIX
16274,LIX,"“How great, how strong, how armed this army is,"
16275,LIX,"And what their guide intends, I will declare,"
16276,LIX,To me the secrets of that heart of his
16277,LIX,And hidden thoughts shall open lie and bare.”
16278,LIX,"Thus Vafrine spoke, nor longer stayed on this,"
16279,LIX,"But for a mantle changed the coat he ware,"
16280,LIX,"Naked was his neck, and bout his forehead bold,"
16281,LIX,Of linen white full twenty yards he rolled.
16282,LIX,
16283,LX,LX
16284,LX,"His weapons were a Syrian bow and quiver,"
16285,LX,"His gestures barbarous, like the Turkish train,"
16286,LX,Wondered all they that heard his tongue deliver
16287,LX,Of every land the language true and plain:
16288,LX,"In Tyre a born Phoenician, by the river"
16289,LX,"Of Nile a knight bred in the Egyptian main,"
16290,LX,Both people would have thought him; forth he rides
16291,LX,"On a swift steed, o’er hills and dales that glides."
16292,LX,
16293,LXI,LXI
16294,LXI,But ere the third day came the French forth sent
16295,LXI,"Their pioneers to even the rougher ways,"
16296,LXI,"And ready made each warlike instrument,"
16297,LXI,Nor aught their labor interrupts or stays;
16298,LXI,The nights in busy toll they likewise spent
16299,LXI,"And with long evenings lengthened forth short days,"
16300,LXI,Till naught was left the hosts that hinder might
16301,LXI,To use their utmost power and strength in fight.
16302,LXI,
16303,LXII,LXII
16304,LXII,"That day, which of the assault the day forerun,"
16305,LXII,"The godly duke in prayer spent well-nigh,"
16306,LXII,"And all the rest, because they had misdone,"
16307,LXII,The sacrament receive and mercy cry;
16308,LXII,Then oft the duke his engines great begun
16309,LXII,To show where least he would their strength apply;
16310,LXII,"His foes rejoiced, deluded in that sort,"
16311,LXII,To see them bent against their surest port:
16312,LXII,
16313,LXIII,LXIII
16314,LXIII,"But after, aided by the friendly night,"
16315,LXIII,His greatest engine to that side he brought
16316,LXIII,"Where plainest seemed the wall, where with their might"
16317,LXIII,The flankers least could hurt them as they fought;
16318,LXIII,And to the southern mountain’s greatest height
16319,LXIII,To raise his turret old Raymondo sought;
16320,LXIII,"And thou Camillo on that part hadst thine,"
16321,LXIII,Where from the north the walls did westward twine.
16322,LXIII,
16323,LXIV,LXIV
16324,LXIV,But when amid the eastern heaven appeared
16325,LXIV,"The rising morning bright as shining glass,"
16326,LXIV,"The troubled Pagans saw, and seeing feared,"
16327,LXIV,"How the great tower stood not where late it was,"
16328,LXIV,And here and there tofore unseen was reared
16329,LXIV,"Of timber strong a huge and fearful mass,"
16330,LXIV,"And numberless with beams, with ropes and strings,"
16331,LXIV,"They view the iron rams, the barks and slings."
16332,LXIV,
16333,LXV,LXV
16334,LXV,"The Syrian people now were no whit slow,"
16335,LXV,"Their best defences to that side to bear,"
16336,LXV,"Where Godfrey did his greatest engine show,"
16337,LXV,From thence where late in vain they placed were:
16338,LXV,But he who at his back right well did know
16339,LXV,"The host of Egypt to be proaching near,"
16340,LXV,"To him called Guelpho, and the Roberts twain,"
16341,LXV,"And said, “On horseback look you still remain,"
16342,LXV,
16343,LXVI,LXVI
16344,LXVI,"“And have regard, while all our people strive"
16345,LXVI,"To scale this wall, where weak it seems and thin,"
16346,LXVI,"Lest unawares some sudden host arrive,"
16347,LXVI,And at our backs unlooked-for war begin.”
16348,LXVI,"This said, three fierce assaults at once they give,"
16349,LXVI,"The hardy soldiers all would die or win,"
16350,LXVI,"And on three parts resistance makes the king,"
16351,LXVI,"And rage gainst strength, despair gainst hope doth bring."
16352,LXVI,
16353,LXVII,LXVII
16354,LXVII,Himself upon his limbs with feeble eild
16355,LXVII,"That shook, unwieldy with their proper weight,"
16356,LXVII,"His armor laid and long unused shield,"
16357,LXVII,And marched gainst Raymond to the mountain’s height;
16358,LXVII,Great Solyman gainst Godfrey took the field;
16359,LXVII,Fornenst Camillo stood Argantes straight
16360,LXVII,"Where Tancred strong he found, so fortune will"
16361,LXVII,That this good prince his wonted foe shall kill.
16362,LXVII,

16761,I,From their forsaken walls the Pagans chase:
16762,I,Yet neither force nor fear nor wisdom drives
16763,I,The constant knight Argantes from his place;
16764,I,"Alone against ten thousand foes he strives,"
16765,I,"Yet dreadless, doubtless, careless seemed his face,"
16766,I,"Nor death, nor danger, but disgrace he fears,"
16767,I,"And still unconquered, though o’erset, appears."
16768,I,
16769,II,II
16770,II,But mongst the rest upon his helmet gay
16771,II,With his broad sword Tancredi came and smote:
16772,II,"The Pagan knew the prince by his array,"
16773,II,"By his strong blows, his armor and his coat;"
16774,II,"For once they fought, and when night stayed that fray,"
16775,II,"New time they chose to end their combat hot,"
16776,II,"But Tancred failed, wherefore the Pagan knight"
16777,II,"Cried, “Tancred, com’st thou thus, thus late to fight?"
16778,II,
16779,III,III
16780,III,"“Too late thou com’st, and not alone to war,"
16781,III,"But yet the fight I neither shun nor fear,"
16782,III,"Although from knighthood true thou errest far,"
16783,III,"Since like an engineer thou dost appear,"
16784,III,"That tower, that troop, thy shield and safety are,"
16785,III,Strange kind of arms in single fight to bear;
16786,III,"Yet shalt thou not escape, O conqueror strong"
16787,III,"Of ladies fair, sharp death, to avenge that wrong.”"
16788,III,
16789,IV,IV
16790,IV,"Lord Tancred smiled, with disdain and scorn,"
16791,IV,"And answerd thus, “To end our strife,” quoth he,"
16792,IV,"“Behold at last I come, and my return,"
16793,IV,"Though late, perchance will be too soon for thee;"
16794,IV,"For thou shalt wish, of hope and help forlorn,"
16795,IV,"Some sea or mountain placed twixt thee and me,"
16796,IV,And well shalt know before we end this fray
16797,IV,No fear of cowardice hath caused my stay.
16798,IV,
16799,V,V
16800,V,"“But come aside, thou by whose prowess dies"
16801,V,"The monsters, knights and giants in all lands,"
16802,V,The killer of weak women thee defies.”
16803,V,"This said, he turned to his fighting bands,"
16804,V,"And bids them all retire. “Forbear,” he cries,"
16805,V,"“To strike this knight, on him let none lay hands;"
16806,V,"For mine he is, more than a common foe,"
16807,V,By challenge new and promise old also.”
16808,V,
16809,VI,VI
16810,VI,"“Descend,” the fierce Circassian gan reply,"
16811,VI,"“Alone, or all this troop for succor take"
16812,VI,"To deserts waste, or place frequented high,"
16813,VI,For vantage none I will the fight forsake:”
16814,VI,"Thus given and taken was the bold defy,"
16815,VI,"And through the press, agreed so, they brake,"
16816,VI,"Their hatred made them one, and as they went,"
16817,VI,Each knight his foe did for despite defend:
16818,VI,
16819,VII,VII
16820,VII,"Great was his thirst of praise, great the desire"
16821,VII,"That Tancred had the Pagan’s blood to spill,"
16822,VII,Nor could that quench his wrath or calm his ire
16823,VII,If other hand his foe should foil or kill.
16824,VII,"He saved him with his shield, and cried “Retire!”"
16825,VII,"To all he met, “and do this knight none ill:”"
16826,VII,"And thus defending gainst his friends his foe,"
16827,VII,Through thousand angry weapons safe they go.
16828,VII,
16829,VII,VII
16830,VII,"They left the city, and they left behind"
16831,VII,"Godfredo’s camp, and far beyond it passed,"
16832,VII,And came where into creeks and bosoms blind
16833,VII,"A winding hill his corners turned and cast,"
16834,VII,A valley small and shady dale they find
16835,VII,Amid the mountains steep so laid and placed
16836,VII,As if some theatre or closed place
16837,VII,Had been for men to fight or beasts to chase.
16838,VII,
16839,IX,IX
16840,IX,"There stayed the champions both with rueful eyes,"
16841,IX,Argantes gan the fortress won to view;
16842,IX,"Tancred his foe withouten shield espies,"
16843,IX,"And said, “Whereon doth thy sad heart devise?"
16844,IX,Think’st thou this hour must end thy life untrue?
16845,IX,"If this thou fear, and dost foresee thy fate,"
16846,IX,"Thy fear is vain, thy foresight comes too late.”"
16847,IX,
16848,X,X
16849,X,"“I think,” quoth he, “on this distressed town,"
16850,X,"The aged Queen of Judah’s ancient land,"
16851,X,"Now lost, now sacked, spoiled and trodden down,"
16852,X,"Whose fall in vain I strived to withstand,"
16853,X,"A small revenge for Sion’s fort o’erthrown,"
16854,X,"That head can be, cut off by my strong hand.”"
16855,X,"This said, together with great heed they flew,"
16856,X,For each his foe for bold and hardy knew.
16857,X,
16858,XI,XI
16859,XI,"Tancred of body active was and light,"
16860,XI,"Quick, nimble, ready both of hand and foot;"
16861,XI,"But higher by the head, the Pagan knight"
16862,XI,"Of limbs far greater was, of heart as stout:"
16863,XI,"Tancred laid low and traversed in his fight,"
16864,XI,"Now to his ward retired, now struck out,"
16865,XI,"Oft with his sword his foe’s fierce blows he broke,"
16866,XI,And rather chose to ward-than bear his stroke.
16867,XI,
16868,XII,XII
16869,XII,"But bold and bolt upright Argantes fought,"
16870,XII,"Unlike in gesture, like in skill and art,"
16871,XII,"His sword outstretched before him far he brought,"
16872,XII,"Nor would his weapon touch, but pierce his heart,"
16873,XII,"To catch his point Prince Tancred strove and sought,"
16874,XII,But at his breast or helm’s unclosed part
16875,XII,"He threatened death, and would with stretched-out brand"
16876,XII,"His entrance close, and fierce assaults withstand."
16877,XII,
16878,XIII,XIII
16879,XIII,"With a tall ship so doth a galley fight,"
16880,XIII,When the still winds stir not the unstable main;
16881,XIII,Where this in nimbleness as that in might
16882,XIII,"Excels; that stands, this goes and comes again,"
16883,XIII,And shifts from prow to poop with turnings light;
16884,XIII,"Meanwhile the other doth unmoved remain,"
16885,XIII,"And on her nimble foe approaching nigh,"
16886,XIII,Her weighty engines tumbleth down from high.
16887,XIII,
16888,XIV,XIV
16889,XIV,"The Christian sought to enter on his foe,"
16890,XIV,"Voiding his point, which at his breast was bent;"
16891,XIV,"Argantes at his face a thrust did throw,"
16892,XIV,"Which while the Prince awards and doth prevent,"
16893,XIV,"His ready hand the Pagan turned so,"
16894,XIV,"That all defence his quickness far o’erwent,"
16895,XIV,"And pierced his side, which done, he said and smiled,"
16896,XIV,“The craftsman is in his own craft beguiled.”
16897,XIV,
16898,XV,XV
16899,XV,"Tancredi bit his lip for scorn and shame,"
16900,XV,"Nor longer stood on points of fence and skill,"
16901,XV,But to revenge so fierce and fast he came
16902,XV,"As if his hand could not o’ertake his will,"
16903,XV,"And at his visor aiming just, gan frame"
16904,XV,"To his proud boast an answer sharp, but still"
16905,XV,"Argantes broke the thrust; and at half-sword,"
16906,XV,"Swift, hardy, bold, in stepped the Christian lord."
16907,XV,
16908,XVI,XVI
16909,XVI,"With his left foot fast forward gan he stride,"
16910,XVI,"And with his left the Pagan’s right arm bent,"
16911,XVI,With his right hand meanwhile the man’s right side
16912,XVI,"He cut, he wounded, mangled, tore and rent."
16913,XVI,"“To his victorious teacher,” Tancred cried,"
16914,XVI,“His conquered scholar hath this answer sent;”
16915,XVI,"Argantes chafed, struggled, turned and twined,"
16916,XVI,Yet could not so his captive arm unbind:
16917,XVI,
16918,XVII,XVII
16919,XVII,"His sword at last he let hang by the chain,"
16920,XVII,"And griped his hardy foe in both his hands,"
16921,XVII,"In his strong arms Tancred caught him again,"
16922,XVII,And thus each other held and wrapped in bands.
16923,XVII,With greater might Alcides did not strain
16924,XVII,"The giant Antheus on the Lybian sands,"
16925,XVII,"On holdfast knots their brawny arms they cast,"
16926,XVII,"And whom he hateth most, each held embraced:"
16927,XVII,
16928,XVIII,XVIII
16929,XVIII,"Such was their wrestling, such their shocks and throws"
16930,XVIII,"That down at once they tumbled both to ground,"
16931,XVIII,"Argantes,—were it hap or skill, who knows,"
16932,XVIII,His better hand loose and in freedom found;
16933,XVIII,"But the good Prince, his hand more fit for blows,"
16934,XVIII,With his huge weight the Pagan underbound;
16935,XVIII,"But he, his disadvantage great that knew,"
16936,XVIII,"Let go his hold, and on his feet up flew:"
16937,XVIII,
16938,XIX,XIX
16939,XIX,"Far slower rose the unwieldy Saracine,"
16940,XIX,And caught a rap ere he was reared upright.
16941,XIX,But as against the blustering winds a pine
16942,XIX,"Now bends his top, now lifts his head on height,"
16943,XIX,"His courage so, when it ’gan most decline,"
16944,XIX,"The man reinforced, and advanced his might,"
16945,XIX,"And with fierce change of blows renewed the fray,"
16946,XIX,"Where rage for skill, horror for art, bore sway."
16947,XIX,
16948,XX,XX
16949,XX,"The purple drops from Tancred’s sides down railed,"
16950,XX,"But from the Pagan ran whole streams of blood,"
16951,XX,"Wherewith his force grew weak, his courage quailed"
16952,XX,As fires die which fuel want or food.
16953,XX,Tancred that saw his feeble arm now failed
16954,XX,"To strike his blows, that scant he stirred or stood,"
16955,XX,"Assuaged his anger, and his wrath allayed,"
16956,XX,"And stepping back, thus gently spoke and said:"
16957,XX,
16958,XXI,XXI
16959,XXI,"“Yield, hardy knight, and chance of war or me"
16960,XXI,"Confess to have subdued thee in this fight,"
16961,XXI,"I will no trophy, triumph, spoil of thee,"
16962,XXI,"Nor glory wish, nor seek a victor’s right"
16963,XXI,More terrible than erst;” herewith grew he
16964,XXI,"And all awaked his fury, rage and might,"
16965,XXI,"And said, “Dar’st thou of vantage speak or think,"
16966,XXI,Or move Argantes once to yield or shrink?
16967,XXI,
16968,XXII,XXII
16969,XXII,"“Use, use thy vantage, thee and fortune both"
16970,XXII,"I scorn, and punish will thy foolish pride:”"
16971,XXII,"As a hot brand flames most ere it forth go’th,"
16972,XXII,And dying blazeth bright on every side;
16973,XXII,"So he, when blood was lost, with anger wroth,"
16974,XXII,"Revived his courage when his puissance died,"
16975,XXII,"And would his latest hour which now drew nigh,"
16976,XXII,"Illustrate with his end, and nobly die."
16977,XXII,
16978,XXIII,XXIII
16979,XXIII,"He joined his left hand to her sister strong,"
16980,XXIII,And with them both let fall his weighty blade.
16981,XXIII,"Tancred to ward his blow his sword up slung,"
16982,XXIII,"But that it smote aside, nor there it stayed,"
16983,XXIII,But from his shoulder to his side along
16984,XXIII,"It glanced, and many wounds at once it made:"
16985,XXIII,"Yet Tancred feared naught, for in his heart"
16986,XXIII,"Found coward dread no place, fear had no part."
16987,XXIII,
16988,XXIV,XXIV
16989,XXIV,"His fearful blow he doubled, but he spent"
16990,XXIV,"His force in waste, and all his strength in vain;"
16991,XXIV,"For Tancred from the blow against him bent,"
16992,XXIV,"Leaped aside, the stroke fell on the plain."
16993,XXIV,"With thine own weight o’erthrown to earth thou went,"
16994,XXIV,"Argantes stout, nor could’st thyself sustain,"
16995,XXIV,"Thyself thou threwest down, O happy man,"
16996,XXIV,Upon whose fall none boast or triumph can!
16997,XXIV,
16998,XXV,XXV
16999,XXV,"His gaping wounds the fall set open wide,"
17000,XXV,"The streams of blood about him made a lake,"
17001,XXV,"Helped with his left hand, on one knee he tried"
17002,XXV,"To rear himself, and new defence to make:"
17003,XXV,"The courteous prince stepped back, and “Yield thee!” cried,"
17004,XXV,"No hurt he proffered him, no blow he strake."
17005,XXV,Meanwhile by stealth the Pagan false him gave
17006,XXV,"A sudden wound, threatening with speeches brave:"
17007,XXV,
17008,XXVI,XXVI
17009,XXVI,"Herewith Tancredi furious grew, and said,"
17010,XXVI,"“Villain, dost thou my mercy so despise?”"
17011,XXVI,"Therewith he thrust and thrust again his blade,"
17012,XXVI,"And through his ventil pierced his dazzled eyes,"
17013,XXVI,"Argantes died, yet no complaint he made,"
17014,XXVI,But as he furious lived he careless dies;
17015,XXVI,"Bold, proud, disdainful, fierce and void of fear"
17016,XXVI,"His motions last, last looks, last speeches were."
17017,XXVI,
17018,XXVII,XXVII
17019,XXVII,"Tancred put up his sword, and praises glad"
17020,XXVII,Gave to his God that saved him in this fight;
17021,XXVII,But yet this bloody conquest feebled had
17022,XXVII,"So much the conqueror’s force, strength and might,"
17023,XXVII,That through the way he feared which homeward led
17024,XXVII,He had not strength enough to walk upright;
17025,XXVII,"Yet as he could his steps from thence he bent,"
17026,XXVII,And foot by foot a heavy pace forth-went;
17027,XXVII,
17028,XXVIII,XXVIII
17029,XXVIII,"His legs could bear him but a little stound,"
17030,XXVIII,"And more he hastes, more tired, less was his speed,"
17031,XXVIII,"On his right hand, at last, laid on the ground"
17032,XXVIII,"He leaned, his hand weak like a shaking reed,"
17033,XXVIII,"Dazzled his eyes, the world on wheels ran round,"
17034,XXVIII,Day wrapped her brightness up in sable weed;
17035,XXVIII,"At length he swooned, and the victor knight"
17036,XXVIII,Naught differed from his conquered foe in fight.
17037,XXVIII,
17038,XXIX,XXIX
17039,XXIX,"But while these lords their private fight pursue,"
17040,XXIX,"Made fierce and cruel through their secret hate,"
17041,XXIX,The victor’s ire destroyed the faithless crew
17042,XXIX,"From street to street, and chased from gate to gate."
17043,XXIX,But of the sacked town the image true
17044,XXIX,"Who can describe, or paint the woful state,"
17045,XXIX,Or with fit words this spectacle express
17046,XXIX,Who can?  or tell the city’s great distress?
17047,XXIX,
17048,XXX,XXX
17049,XXX,"Blood, murder, death, each street, house, church defiled,"
17050,XXX,"There heaps of slain appear, there mountains high;"
17051,XXX,There underneath the unburied hills up-piled
17052,XXX,"Of bodies dead, the living buried lie;"
17053,XXX,There the sad mother with her tender child
17054,XXX,"Doth tear her tresses loose, complain and fly,"
17055,XXX,And there the spoiler by her amber hair
17056,XXX,Draws to his lust the virgin chaste and fair.
17057,XXX,
17058,XXXI,XXXI
17059,XXXI,But through the way that to the west-hill yood
17060,XXXI,"Whereon the old and stately temple stands,"
17061,XXXI,All soiled with gore and wet with lukewarm blood
17062,XXXI,"Rinaldo ran, and chased the Pagan bands;"
17063,XXXI,"Above their heads he heaved his curtlax good,"
17064,XXXI,"Life in his grace, and death lay in his hands,"
17065,XXXI,"Nor helm nor target strong his blows off bears,"
17066,XXXI,Best armed there seemed he no arms that wears;
17067,XXXI,
17068,XXXII,XXXII
17069,XXXII,For gainst his armed foes he only bends
17070,XXXII,"His force, and scorns the naked folk to wound;"
17071,XXXII,"Them whom no courage arms, no arms defends,"
17072,XXXII,He chased with his looks and dreadful sound:
17073,XXXII,"Oh, who can tell how far his force extends?"
17074,XXXII,"How these he scorns, threats those, lays them on ground?"
17075,XXXII,"How with unequal harm, with equal fear"
17076,XXXII,"Fled all, all that well armed or naked were:"
17077,XXXII,
17078,XXXIII,XXXIII
17079,XXXIII,"Fast fled the people weak, and with the same"
17080,XXXIII,A squadron strong is to the temple gone
17081,XXXIII,"Which, burned and builded oft, still keeps the name"
17082,XXXIII,"Of the first founder, wise King Solomon;"
17083,XXXIII,That prince this stately house did whilom frame
17084,XXXIII,"Of cedar trees, of gold and marble stone;"
17085,XXXIII,"Now not so rich, yet strong and sure it was,"
17086,XXXIII,"With turrets high, thick walls, and doors of brass."
17087,XXXIII,
17088,XXXIV,XXXIV
17089,XXXIV,The knight arrived where in warklike sort
17090,XXXIV,The men that ample church had fortified.
17091,XXXIV,"And closed found each wicket, gate and port,"
17092,XXXIV,"And on the top defences ready spied,"
17093,XXXIV,"He left his frowning looks, and twice that fort"
17094,XXXIV,"From his high top down to the groundwork eyed,"
17095,XXXIV,"And entrance sought, and twice with his swift foot"
17096,XXXIV,The mighty place he measured about.
17097,XXXIV,
17098,XXXV,XXXV
17099,XXXV,Like as a wolf about the closed fold
17100,XXXV,"Rangeth by night his hoped prey to get,"
17101,XXXV,Enraged with hunger and with malice old
17102,XXXV,Which kind ’twixt him and harmless sheep hath set:
17103,XXXV,"So searched he high and low about that hold,"
17104,XXXV,"Where he might enter without stop or let,"
17105,XXXV,"In the great court he stayed, his foes above"
17106,XXXV,"Attend the assault, and would their fortune prove."
17107,XXXV,
17108,XXXVI,XXXVI
17109,XXXVI,"There lay by chance a posted tree thereby,"
17110,XXXVI,"Kept for some needful use, whate’er it were,"
17111,XXXVI,The armed galleys not so thick nor high
17112,XXXVI,Their tall and lofty masts at Genes uprear;
17113,XXXVI,This beam the knight against the gates made fly
17114,XXXVI,"From his strong hands all weights which lift and bear,"
17115,XXXVI,"Like a light lance that tree he shook and tossed,"
17116,XXXVI,"And bruised the gate, the threshold and the post."
17117,XXXVI,
17118,XXXVII,XXXVII
17119,XXXVII,"No marble stone, no metal strong outbore"
17120,XXXVII,"The wondrous might of that redoubled blow,"
17121,XXXVII,"The brazen hinges from the wall it tore,"
17122,XXXVII,"It broke the locks, and laid the doors down low,"
17123,XXXVII,"No iron ram, no engine could do more,"
17124,XXXVII,"Nor cannons great that thunderbolts forth throw,"
17125,XXXVII,"His people like a flowing stream inthrong,"
17126,XXXVII,And after them entered the victor strong;
17127,XXXVII,
17128,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
17129,XXXVIII,The woful slaughter black and loathsome made
17130,XXXVIII,"That house, sometime the sacred house of God,"
17131,XXXVIII,"O heavenly justice, if thou be delayed,"
17132,XXXVIII,On wretched sinners sharper falls thy rod!
17133,XXXVIII,In them this place profaned which invade
17134,XXXVIII,"Thou kindled ire, and mercy all forbode,"
17135,XXXVIII,Until with their hearts’ blood the Pagans vile
17136,XXXVIII,This temple washed which they did late defile.
17137,XXXVIII,
17138,XXXIX,XXXIX
17139,XXXIX,But Solyman this while himself fast sped
17140,XXXIX,"Up to the fort which David’s tower is named,"
17141,XXXIX,"And with him all the soldiers left he led,"
17142,XXXIX,And gainst each entrance new defences framed:
17143,XXXIX,"The tyrant Aladine eke thither fled,"
17144,XXXIX,"To whom the Soldan thus, far off, exclaimed,"
17145,XXXIX,"Thyself, within this fortress safe uplock:"
17146,XXXIX,
17147,XL,XL
17148,XL,“For well this fortress shall thee and thy crown
17149,XL,"Defend, awhile here may we safe remain.”"
17150,XL,"“Alas!” quoth he, “alas, for this fair town,"
17151,XL,"Which cruel war beats down even with the plain,"
17152,XL,"My life is done, mine empire trodden down,"
17153,XL,"I reigned, I lived, but now nor live nor reign;"
17154,XL,"For now, alas!  behold the fatal hour"
17155,XL,"That ends our life, and ends our kingly power.”"
17156,XL,
17157,XLI,XLI
17158,XLI,"“Where is your virtue, where your wisdom grave,"
17159,XLI,"And courage stout?” the angry Soldan said,"
17160,XLI,"“Let chance our kingdoms take which erst she gave,"
17161,XLI,Yet in our hearts our kingly worth is laid;
17162,XLI,"But come, and in this fort your person save,"
17163,XLI,Refresh your weary limbs and strength decayed:”
17164,XLI,"Thus counselled he, and did to safety bring"
17165,XLI,Within that fort the weak and aged king.
17166,XLI,
17167,XLII,XLII
17168,XLII,"His iron mace in both his hands he hent,"
17169,XLII,"And on his thigh his trusty sword he tied,"
17170,XLII,"And to the entrance fierce and fearless went,"
17171,XLII,"And kept the strait, and all the French defied:"
17172,XLII,"The blows were mortal which he gave or lent,"
17173,XLII,"For whom he hit he slew, else by his side"
17174,XLII,"Laid low on earth, that all fled from the place"
17175,XLII,Where they beheld that great and dreadful mace.
17176,XLII,
17177,XLIII,XLIII
17178,XLIII,But old Raymondo with his hardy crew
17179,XLIII,"By chance came thither, to his great mishap;"
17180,XLIII,"To that defended path the old man flew,"
17181,XLIII,"And scorned his blows and him that kept the gap,"
17182,XLIII,"He struck his foe, his blow no blood forth drew,"
17183,XLIII,"But on the front with that he caught a rap,"
17184,XLIII,"Which in a swoon, low in the dust him laid,"
17185,XLIII,"Wide open, trembling, with his arms displayed."
17186,XLIII,
17187,XLIV,XLIV
17188,XLIV,"The Pagans gathered heart at last, though fear"
17189,XLIV,"Their courage weak had put to flight but late,"
17190,XLIV,"So that the conquerors repulsed were,"
17191,XLIV,"And beaten back, else slain before the Gate:"
17192,XLIV,"The Soldan, mongst the dead beside him near"
17193,XLIV,"That saw Lord Raymond lie in such estate,"
17194,XLIV,"Cried to his men, “Within these bars,” quoth he,"
17195,XLIV,"“Come draw this knight, and let him captive be.”"
17196,XLIV,
17197,XLV,XLV
17198,XLV,"Forward they rushed to execute his word,"
17199,XLV,"But hard and dangerous that emprise they found,"
17200,XLV,"For none of Raymond’s men forsook their lord,"
17201,XLV,"But to their guide’s defence they flocked round,"
17202,XLV,"Thence fury fights, hence pity draws the sword,"
17203,XLV,"Nor strive they for vile cause or on light ground,"
17204,XLV,"The life and freedom of that champion brave,"
17205,XLV,"Those spoil, these would preserve, those kill, these save."
17206,XLV,
17207,XLVI,XLVI
17208,XLVI,But yet at last if they had longer fought
17209,XLVI,The hardy Soldan would have won the field;
17210,XLVI,For gainst his thundering mace availed naught
17211,XLVI,Or helm of temper fine or sevenfold shield:
17212,XLVI,But from each side great succor now was brought
17213,XLVI,"To his weak foes, now fit to faint and yield,"
17214,XLVI,And both at once to aid and help the same
17215,XLVI,The sovereign Duke and young Rinaldo came.
17216,XLVI,
17217,XLVII,XLVII
17218,XLVII,"As when a shepherd, raging round about"
17219,XLVII,"That sees a storm with wind, hail, thunder, rain,"
17220,XLVII,"When gloomy clouds have day’s bright eye put out,"
17221,XLVII,His tender flocks drives from the open plain
17222,XLVII,"To some thick grove or mountain’s shady foot,"
17223,XLVII,"Where Heaven’s fierce wrath they may unhurt sustain,"
17224,XLVII,"And with his hook, his whistle and his cries"
17225,XLVII,"Drives forth his fleecy charge, and with them flies:"
17226,XLVII,
17227,XLVIII,XLVIII
17228,XLVIII,"So fled the Soldan, when he gan descry"
17229,XLVIII,"This tempest come from angry war forthcast,"
17230,XLVIII,"The armor clashed and lightened gainst the sky,"
17231,XLVIII,"And from each side swords, weapons, fire outbrast:"
17232,XLVIII,"He sent his folk up to the fortress high,"
17233,XLVIII,"To shun the furious storm, himself stayed last,"
17234,XLVIII,"Yet to the danger he gave place at length,"
17235,XLVIII,"For wit, his courage; wisdom ruled his strength."
17236,XLVIII,
17237,XLIX,XLIX
17238,XLIX,"But scant the knight was safe the gate within,"
17239,XLIX,"Scant closed were the doors, when having broke"
17240,XLIX,"The bars, Rinaldo doth assault begin"
17241,XLIX,"Against the port, and on the wicket stroke"
17242,XLIX,"His matchless might, his great desire to win,"
17243,XLIX,"His oath and promise, doth his wrath provoke,"
17244,XLIX,"For he had sworn, nor should his word be vain,"
17245,XLIX,To kill the man that had Prince Sweno slain.
17246,XLIX,
17247,L,L
17248,L,And now his armed hand that castle great
17249,L,"Would have assaulted, and had shortly won,"
17250,L,Nor safe pardie the Soldan there a seat
17251,L,"Had found his fatal foes’ sharp wrath to shun,"
17252,L,Had not Godfredo sounded the retreat;
17253,L,"For now dark shades to shroud the earth begun,"
17254,L,"Within the town the duke would lodge that night,"
17255,L,And with the morn renew the assault and fight.
17256,L,
17257,LI,LI
17258,LI,"With cheerful look thus to his folk he said,"
17259,LI,"“High God hath holpen well his children dear,"
17260,LI,"This work is done, the rest this night delayed"
17261,LI,"Doth little labor bring, less doubt, no fear,"
17262,LI,"This tower, our foe’s weak hope and latest aid,"
17263,LI,"We conquer will, when sun shall next appear:"
17264,LI,Meanwhile with love and tender ruth go see
17265,LI,And comfort those which hurt and wounded be;
17266,LI,
17267,LII,LII
17268,LII,“Go cure their wounds which boldly ventured
17269,LII,"Their lives, and spilt their bloods to get this hold,"
17270,LII,"That fitteth more this host for Christ forth led,"
17271,LII,"Than thirst of vengeance, or desire of gold;"
17272,LII,"Too much, ah, too much blood this day is shed!"
17273,LII,"In some we too much haste to spoil behold,"
17274,LII,"But I command no more you spoil and kill,"
17275,LII,And let a trumpet publish forth my will.”
17276,LII,
17277,LIII,LIII
17278,LIII,"This said, he went where Raymond panting lay,"
17279,LIII,Waked from the swoon wherein he late had been.
17280,LIII,Nor Solyman with countenance less gay
17281,LIII,"Bespake his troops, and kept his grief unseen;"
17282,LIII,"“My friends, you are unconquered this day,"
17283,LIII,"In spite of fortune still our hope is green,"
17284,LIII,"For underneath great shows of harm and fear,"
17285,LIII,"Our dangers small, our losses little were:"
17286,LIII,
17287,LIV,LIV
17288,LIV,"“Burnt are your houses, and your people slain,"
17289,LIV,"Yet safe your town is, though your walls be gone,"
17290,LIV,For in yourselves and in your sovereign
17291,LIV,"Consists your city, not in lime and stone;"
17292,LIV,"Your king is safe, and safe is all his train"
17293,LIV,"In this strong fort defended from their fone,"
17294,LIV,"And on this empty conquest let them boast,"
17295,LIV,"Till with this town again, their lives be lost;"
17296,LIV,
17297,LV,LV
17298,LV,"“And on their heads the loss at last will light,"
17299,LV,"For with good fortune proud and insolent,"
17300,LV,"In spoil and murder spend they day and night,"
17301,LV,"In riot, drinking, lust and ravishment,"
17302,LV,And may amid their preys with little fight
17303,LV,"At ease be overthrown, killed, slain and spent,"
17304,LV,If in this carelessness the Egyptian host
17305,LV,"Upon them fall, which now draws near this coast."
17306,LV,
17307,LVI,LVI
17308,LVI,“Meanwhile the highest buildings of this town
17309,LVI,"We may shake down with stones about their ears,"
17310,LVI,"And with our darts and spears from engines thrown,"
17311,LVI,Command that hill Christ’s sepulchre that bears:”
17312,LVI,"Thus comforts he their hopes and hearts cast down,"
17313,LVI,"Awakes their valors, and exiles their fears."
17314,LVI,"But while the things hapt thus, Vafrino goes"
17315,LVI,"Unknown, amid ten thousand armed foes."
17316,LVI,
17317,LVII,LVII
17318,LVII,"The sun nigh set had brought to end the day,"
17319,LVII,"When Vafrine went the Pagan host to spy,"
17320,LVII,He passed unknown a close and secret way;
17321,LVII,"A traveller, false, cunning, crafty, sly,"
17322,LVII,Past Ascalon he saw the morning gray
17323,LVII,"Step o’er the threshold of the eastern sky,"
17324,LVII,"And ere bright Titan half his course had run,"
17325,LVII,"That camp, that mighty host to show begun."
17326,LVII,
17327,LVIII,LVIII
17328,LVIII,"Tents infinite, and standards broad he spies,"
17329,LVIII,"This red, that white, that blue, this purple was,"
17330,LVIII,"And hears strange tongues, and stranger harmonies"
17331,LVIII,"Of trumpets, clarions, and well-sounding brass:"
17332,LVIII,"The elephant there brays, the camel cries."
17333,LVIII,The horses neigh as to and fro they pass:
17334,LVIII,"Which seen and heard, he said within his thought,"
17335,LVIII,"Hither all Asia is, all Afric, brought."
17336,LVIII,
17337,LIX,LIX
17338,LIX,"He viewed the camp awhile, her site and seat,"
17339,LIX,"What ditch, what trench it had, what rampire strong,"
17340,LIX,"Nor close, nor secret ways to work his feat"
17341,LIX,"He longer sought, nor hid him from the throng;"
17342,LIX,"But entered through the gates, broad, royal, great,"
17343,LIX,"And oft he asked, and answered oft among,"
17344,LIX,"In questions wise, in answers short and sly;"
17345,LIX,"Bold was his look, eyes quick, front lifted high:"
17346,LIX,
17347,LX,LX
17348,LX,"On every side he pried here and there,"
17349,LX,"And marked each way, each passage and each tent:"
17350,LX,"The knights he notes, their steeds, and arms they bear,"
17351,LX,"Their names, their armor, and their government;"
17352,LX,"And greater secrets hopes to learn, and hear,"
17353,LX,"Their hidden purpose, and their close intent:"
17354,LX,"So long he walked and wandered, till he spied"
17355,LX,The way to approach the great pavilions’ side:
17356,LX,
17357,LXI,LXI
17358,LXI,"There as he looked he saw the canvas rent,"
17359,LXI,Through which the voice found eath and open way
17360,LXI,From the close lodgings of the regal tent
17361,LXI,And inmost closet where the captain lay;
17362,LXI,"So that if Emireno spake, forth went"
17363,LXI,"The sound to them that listen what they say,"
17364,LXI,"There Vafrine watched, and those that saw him thought"
17365,LXI,To mend the breach that there he stood and wrought.
17366,LXI,
17367,LXII,LXII
17368,LXII,"The captain great within bare-headed stood,"
17369,LXII,"His body armed and clad in purple weed,"
17370,LXII,"Two pages bore his shield and helmet good,"
17371,LXII,He leaning on a bending lance gave heed
17372,LXII,"To a big man whose looks were fierce and proud,"
17373,LXII,"With whom he parleyed of some haughty deed,"
17374,LXII,"Godfredo’s name as Vafrine watched he heard,"
17375,LXII,"Which made him give more heed, take more regard:"
17376,LXII,
17377,LXIII,LXIII
17378,LXIII,"Thus spake the chieftain to that surly sir,"
17379,LXIII,“Art thou so sure that Godfrey shall be slain?”
17380,LXIII,"“I am,” quoth he, “and swear ne’er to retire,"
17381,LXIII,"Except he first be killed, to court again."
17382,LXIII,I will prevent those that with me conspire:
17383,LXIII,Nor other guerdon ask I for my pain
17384,LXIII,But that I may hang up his harness brave
17385,LXIII,"At Gair, and under them these words engrave:"
17386,LXIII,
17387,LXIV,LXIV
17388,LXIV,“‘These arms Ormondo took in noble fight
17389,LXIV,"From Godfrey proud, that spoiled all Asia’s lands,"
17390,LXIV,"And with them took his life, and here on high,"
17391,LXIV,"In memory thereof, this trophy stands.’”"
17392,LXIV,"The duke replied, “Ne’er shall that deed, bold knight,"
17393,LXIV,"Pass unrewarded at our sovereign’s hands,"
17394,LXIV,"What thou demandest shall he gladly grant,"
17395,LXIV,Nor gold nor guerdon shalt thou wish or want.
17396,LXIV,
17397,LXV,LXV
17398,LXV,"“Those counterfeited armors then prepare,"
17399,LXV,Because the day of fight approacheth fast.”
17400,LXV,"“They ready are,” quoth he; then both forbare"
17401,LXV,"From further talk, these speeches were the last."
17402,LXV,"Vafrine, these great things heard, with grief and care"
17403,LXV,"Remained astound, and in his thoughts oft cast"
17404,LXV,"What treason false this was, how feigned were"
17405,LXV,"Those arms, but yet that doubt he could not clear."
17406,LXV,
17407,LXVI,LXVI
17408,LXVI,"From thence he parted, and broad waking lay"
17409,LXVI,"All that long night, nor slumbered once nor slept:"
17410,LXVI,But when the camp by peep of springing day
17411,LXVI,"Their banner spread, and knights on horseback leapt,"
17412,LXVI,"With them he marched forth in meet array,"
17413,LXVI,"And where they pitched lodged, and with them kept,"
17414,LXVI,"And then from tent to tent he stalked about,"
17415,LXVI,"To hear and see, and learn this secret out;"
17416,LXVI,
17417,LXVII,LXVII
17418,LXVII,"Searching about, on a rich throne he fand"
17419,LXVII,"Armida set with dames and knights around,"
17420,LXVII,"Sullen she sat, and sighed, it seemed she scanned"
17421,LXVII,"Some weighty matters in her thoughts profounds,"
17422,LXVII,"Her rosy cheek leaned on her lily hand,"
17423,LXVII,"Her eyes, love’s twinkling stars, she bent to ground,"
17424,LXVII,"Weep she, or no, he knows not, yet appears"
17425,LXVII,Her humid eyes even great with child with tears.
17426,LXVII,
17427,LXVIII,LXVIII
17428,LXVIII,"He saw before her set Adrastus grim,"
17429,LXVIII,"That seemed scant to live, move, or respire,"
17430,LXVIII,"So was he fixed on his mistress trim,"
17431,LXVIII,"So gazed he, and fed his fond desire;"
17432,LXVIII,"But Tisiphern beheld now her now him,"
17433,LXVIII,"And quaked sometime for love, sometime for ire,"
17434,LXVIII,"And in his cheeks the color went and came,"
17435,LXVIII,"For there wrath’s fire now burnt, now shone love’s flame."
17436,LXVIII,
17437,LXIX,LXIX
17438,LXIX,"Then from the garland fair of virgins bright,"
17439,LXIX,"Mongst whom he lay enclosed, rose Altamore,"
17440,LXIX,"His hot desire he hid and kept from sight,"
17441,LXIX,"His looks were ruled by Cupid’s crafty lore,"
17442,LXIX,"His left eye viewed her hand, her face, his right"
17443,LXIX,"Both watched her beauties hid and secret store,"
17444,LXIX,And entrance found where her thin veil bewrayed
17445,LXIX,The milken-way between her breasts that laid.
17446,LXIX,
17447,LXX,LXX
17448,LXX,"Her eyes Armida lift from earth at last,"
17449,LXX,"And cleared again her front and visage sad,"
17450,LXX,Midst clouds of woe her looks which overcast
17451,LXX,"She lightened forth a smile, sweet, pleasant, glad;"
17452,LXX,"“My lord,” quoth she, “your oath and promise passed,"
17453,LXX,"Hath freed my heart of all the griefs it had,"
17454,LXX,"That now in hope of sweet revenge it lives,"
17455,LXX,"Such joy, such ease, desired vengeance gives.”"
17456,LXX,
17457,LXXI,LXXI
17458,LXXI,"“Cheer up thy looks,” answered the Indian king,"
17459,LXXI,"“And for sweet beauty’s sake, appease thy woe,"
17460,LXXI,"Cast at your feet ere you expect the thing,"
17461,LXXI,I will present the head of thy strong foe;
17462,LXXI,Else shall this hand his person captive bring
17463,LXXI,And cast in prison deep;” he boasted so.
17464,LXXI,"His rival heard him well, yet answered naught,"
17465,LXXI,"But bit his lips, and grieved in secret thought."
17466,LXXI,
17467,LXXII,LXXII
17468,LXXII,"To Tisipherne the damsel turning right,"
17469,LXXII,"“And what say you, my noble lord?” quoth she."
17470,LXXII,"He taunting said, “I that am slow to fight"
17471,LXXII,"Will follow far behind, the worth to see"
17472,LXXII,"Of this your terrible and puissant knight,”"
17473,LXXII,In scornful words this bitter scoff gave he.
17474,LXXII,"“Good reason,” quoth the king, “thou come behind,"
17475,LXXII,Nor e’er compare thee with the Prince of Ind.”
17476,LXXII,
17477,LXXIII,LXXIII
17478,LXXIII,"Lord Tisiphernes shook his head, and said,"
17479,LXXIII,"“Oh, had my power free like my courage been,"
17480,LXXIII,"Or had I liberty to use this blade,"
17481,LXXIII,"Who slow, who weakest is, soon should be seen,"
17482,LXXIII,"Nor thou, nor thy great vaunts make me afraid,"
17483,LXXIII,"But cruel love I fear, and this fair queen.”"
17484,LXXIII,"This said, to challenge him the king forth leapt,"
17485,LXXIII,"But up their mistress start, and twixt them stepped:"
17486,LXXIII,
17487,LXXIV,LXXIV
17488,LXXIV,"“Will you thus rob me of that gift,” quoth she,"
17489,LXXIV,“Which each hath vowed to give by word and oath?
17490,LXXIV,"You are my champions, let that title be"
17491,LXXIV,The bond of love and peace between you both;
17492,LXXIV,"He that displeased is, is displeased with me,"
17493,LXXIV,"For which of you is grieved, and I not wroth?”"
17494,LXXIV,"Thus warned she them, their hearts, for ire nigh broke,"
17495,LXXIV,In forced peace and rest thus bore love’s yoke.
17496,LXXIV,
17497,LXXV,LXXV
17498,LXXV,"All this heard Vafrine as he stood beside,"
17499,LXXV,"And having learned the truth, he left the tent,"
17500,LXXV,That treason was against the Christian’s guide
17501,LXXV,"Contrived, he wist, yet wist not how it went,"
17502,LXXV,"By words and questions far off, he tried"
17503,LXXV,"To find the truth; more difficult, more bent"
17504,LXXV,"Was he to know it, and resolved to die,"
17505,LXXV,Or of that secret close the intent to spy.
17506,LXXV,
17507,LXXVI,LXXVI
17508,LXXVI,"Of sly intelligence he proved all ways,"
17509,LXXVI,"All crafts, all wiles, that in his thoughts abide,"
17510,LXXVI,"Yet all in vain the man by wit assays,"
17511,LXXVI,To know that false compact and practice hid:
17512,LXXVI,"But chance, what wisdom could not tell, bewrays,"
17513,LXXVI,"Fortune of all his doubt the knots undid,"
17514,LXXVI,So that prepared for Godfrey’s last mishap
17515,LXXVI,"At ease he found the net, and spied the trap."
17516,LXXVI,
17517,LXXVII,LXXVII
17518,LXXVII,"Thither he turned again where seated was,"
17519,LXXVII,"The angry lover, ’twixt her friends and lords,"
17520,LXXVII,"For in that troop much talk he thought would pass,"
17521,LXXVII,"Each great assembly store of news affords,"
17522,LXXVII,"He sided there a lusty lovely lass,"
17523,LXXVII,"And with some courtly terms the wench he boards,"
17524,LXXVII,"He feigns acquaintance, and as bold appears"
17525,LXXVII,As he had known that virgin twenty years.
17526,LXXVII,
17527,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
17528,LXXVIII,"He said, “Would some sweet lady grace me so,"
17529,LXXVIII,"To chose me for her champion, friend and knight,"
17530,LXXVIII,"Proud Godfrey’s or Rinaldo’s head, I trow,"
17531,LXXVIII,Should feel the sharpness of my curtlax bright;
17532,LXXVIII,"Ask me the head, fair mistress, of some foe,"
17533,LXXVIII,For to your beauty wooed is my might;”
17534,LXXVIII,"So he began, and meant in speeches wise"
17535,LXXVIII,"Further to wade, but thus he broke the ice."
17536,LXXVIII,
17537,LXXIX,LXXIX
17538,LXXIX,"Therewith he smiled, and smiling gan to frame"
17539,LXXIX,"His looks so to their old and native grace,"
17540,LXXIX,"That towards him another virgin came,"
17541,LXXIX,"Heard him, beheld him, and with bashful face"
17542,LXXIX,"Said, “For thy mistress choose no other dame"
17543,LXXIX,"But me, on me thy love and service place,"
17544,LXXIX,"I take thee for my champion, and apart"
17545,LXXIX,"Would reason with thee, if my knight thou art.”"
17546,LXXIX,
17547,LXXX,LXXX
17548,LXXX,"Withdrawn, she thus began, “Vafrine, pardie,"
17549,LXXX,"I know thee well, and me thou knowest of old,”"
17550,LXXX,"To his last trump this drove the subtle spy,"
17551,LXXX,"But smiling towards her he turned him bold,"
17552,LXXX,"“Ne’er that I wot I saw thee erst with eye,"
17553,LXXX,"Yet for thy worth all eyes should thee behold,"
17554,LXXX,"Thus much I know right well, for from the same"
17555,LXXX,Which erst you gave me different is my name.
17556,LXXX,
17557,LXXXI,LXXXI
17558,LXXXI,"“My mother bore me near Bisertus wall,"
17559,LXXXI,"Her name was Lesbine, mine is Almansore!”"

17572,LXXXII,"The squire her lovely beauty called to mind,"
17573,LXXXII,And marked her visage fair: “From thee expel

17581,LXXXIII,"I sigh for sorrow, mourn and weep for pain:"
17582,LXXXIII,"But if to spy perchance thou here sojourn,"
17583,LXXXIII,"Great hap thou hast to know these secrets plain,"

17590,LXXXIV,"Women have tongues of craft, and hearts of guile,"
17591,LXXXIV,"They will, they will not, fools that on them trust,"
17592,LXXXIV,"For in their speech is death, hell in their smile;"
17593,LXXXIV,"At last he said, “If hence depart you lust,"

17604,LXXXV,"Thither where Vafrine her unseen abode,"

17610,LXXXVI,"Vafrine began, “Gainst Godfrey’s life contrived"
17611,LXXXVI,The false compacts and trains unfold aright:”
17612,LXXXVI,"Then she those treasons, from their spring derived,"

17614,LXXXVI,"“Eight knights,” she says, “all courtiers brave, there are,"

17618,LXXXVII,"“These, whether hate or hope of gain them move,"

17621,LXXXVII,"To win lost Asia from his Christian foe,"
17622,LXXXVII,"These, with the cross scored on their arms above,"
17623,LXXXVII,"And armed like Frenchmen will disguised go,"

17631,LXXXVIII,"Shall mingled be, to give the fatal blow"
17632,LXXXVIII,"They will keep near, and pierce Godfredo’s breast,"
17633,LXXXVIII,"While of his faithful guard they bear false show,"
17634,LXXXVIII,"And all their swords are dipped in poison strong,"

17860,CXI,"Quoth Vafrine, “Cure him first, and then complain,"
17861,CXI,Medicine is life’s chief friend; plaint her most foe:”
17862,CXI,"They plucked his armor off, and she each vein,"
17863,CXI,"Each joint, and sinew felt, and handled so,"

17868,CXII,From weariness and loss of blood she spied

17871,CXII,"She had to bind his wounds, in so great need,"
17872,CXII,"But love could other bands, though strange, provide,"
17873,CXII,"And pity wept for joy to see that deed,"
17874,CXII,"For with her amber locks cut off, each wound"
17875,CXII,"She tied: O happy man, so cured so bound!"
17876,CXII,
17877,CXIII,CXIII
17878,CXIII,"For why her veil was short and thin, those deep"

17880,CXIII,"Nor salve nor simple had she, yet to keep"
17881,CXIII,"Her knight on live, strong charms of wondrous kind"
17882,CXIII,"She said, and from him drove that deadly sleep,"
17883,CXIII,"That now his eyes he lifted, turned and twined,"
17884,CXIII,"And saw his squire, and saw that courteous dame"
17885,CXIII,"In habit strange, and wondered whence she came."
17886,CXIII,
17887,CXIV,CXIV
17888,CXIV,"He said, “O Vafrine, tell me, whence com’st thou?"

17897,CXV,CXV
17898,CXV,Vafrine devised this while how he might bear
17899,CXV,"His master home, ere night obscured the land,"
17900,CXV,"When lo, a troop of soldiers did appear,"
17901,CXV,"Whom he descried to be Tancredi’s band,"
17902,CXV,With him when he and Argant met they were;
17903,CXV,"But when they went to combat hand for hand,"

17907,CXVI,CXVI
17908,CXVI,"Besides them, many followed that enquest,"
17909,CXVI,"But these alone found out the rightest way,"
17910,CXVI,Upon their friendly arms the men addressed
17911,CXVI,"A seat whereon he sat, he leaned, he lay:"
17912,CXVI,"Quoth Tancred, “Shall the strong Circassian rest"
17913,CXVI,"In this broad field, for wolves and crows a prey?"
17914,CXVI,"Ah no, defraud not you that champion brave"
17915,CXVI,"Of his just praise, of his due tomb and grave:"
17916,CXVI,
17917,CXVII,CXVII
17918,CXVII,"“With his dead bones no longer war have I,"
17919,CXVII,"Boldly he died and nobly was he slain,"
17920,CXVII,Then let us not that honor him deny
17921,CXVII,Which after death alonely doth remain:”
17922,CXVII,"The Pagan dead they lifted up on high,"
17923,CXVII,And after Tancred bore him through the plain.
17924,CXVII,"Close by the virgin chaste did Vafrine ride,"
17925,CXVII,"As he that was her squire, her guard, her guide."
17926,CXVII,
17927,CXVIII,CXVIII
17928,CXVIII,"“Not home,” quoth Tancred, “to my wonted tent,"
17929,CXVIII,"But bear me to this royal town, I pray,"
17930,CXVIII,That if cut short by human accident
17931,CXVIII,"I die, there I may see my latest day,"
17932,CXVIII,The place where Christ upon his cross was rent
17933,CXVIII,"To heaven perchance may easier make the way,"
17934,CXVIII,"And ere I yield to Death’s and Fortune’s rage,"

17936,CXVIII,
17937,CXIX,CXIX
17938,CXIX,"Thus to the city was Tancredi borne,"
17939,CXIX,"And fell on sleep, laid on a bed of down."
17940,CXIX,Vafrino where the damsel might sojourn
17941,CXIX,"A chamber got, close, secret, near his own;"
17942,CXIX,"That done he came the mighty duke beforn,"
17943,CXIX,"And entrance found, for till his news were known,"
17944,CXIX,"Naught was concluded mongst those knights and lords,"
17945,CXIX,Their counsel hung on his report and words.
17946,CXIX,
17947,CXX,CXX
17948,CXX,"Where weak and weary wounded Raymond laid,"
17949,CXX,"Godfrey was set upon his couch’s side,"
17950,CXX,And round about the man a ring was made
17951,CXX,Of lords and knights that filled the chamber wide;
17952,CXX,"There while the squire his late discovery said,"
17953,CXX,"To break his talk, none answered, none replied,"
17954,CXX,"“My lord,” he said, “at your command I went"
17955,CXX,"And viewed their camp, each cabin, booth and tent;"
17956,CXX,
17957,CXXI,CXXI
17958,CXXI,“But of that mighty host the number true
17959,CXXI,"Expect not that I can or should descry,"
17960,CXXI,All covered with their armies might you view
17961,CXXI,"The fields, the plains, the dales and mountains high,"
17962,CXXI,"I saw what way soe’er they went and drew,"
17963,CXXI,"They spoiled the land, drunk floods and fountains dry,"
17964,CXXI,"For not whole Jordan could have given them drink,"
17965,CXXI,"Nor all the grain in Syria, bread, I think."
17966,CXXI,
17967,CXXII,CXXII
17968,CXXII,“But yet amongst them many bands are found
17969,CXXII,"Both horse and foot, of little force and might,"
17970,CXXII,"That keep no order, know no trumpet’s sound,"
17971,CXXII,"That draw no sword, but far off shoot and fight,"
17972,CXXII,But yet the Persian army doth abound
17973,CXXII,"With many a footman strong and hardy knight,"
17974,CXXII,So doth the King’s own troop which all is framed
17975,CXXII,"Of soldiers old, the Immortal Squadron named."
17976,CXXII,
17977,CXXIII,CXXIII
17978,CXXIII,"“Immortal called is that band of right,"
17979,CXXIII,"For of that number never wanteth one,"
17980,CXXIII,But in his empty place some other knight
17981,CXXIII,"Steps in, when any man is dead or gone:"
17982,CXXIII,"This army’s leader Emireno hight,"
17983,CXXIII,"Like whom in wit and strength are few or none,"
17984,CXXIII,"Who hath in charge in plain and pitched field,"
17985,CXXIII,"To fight with you, to make you fly or yield."
17986,CXXIII,
17987,CXXIV,CXXIV
17988,CXXIV,“And well I know their army and their host
17989,CXXIV,Within a day or two will here arrive:
17990,CXXIV,But thee Rinaldo it behoveth most
17991,CXXIV,"To keep thy noble head, for which they strive,"
17992,CXXIV,For all the chief in arms or courage boast
17993,CXXIV,"They will the same to Queen Armida give,"
17994,CXXIV,"And for the same she gives herself in price,"
17995,CXXIV,Such hire will many hands to work entice.
17996,CXXIV,
17997,CXXV,CXXV
17998,CXXV,"“The chief of these that have thy murder sworn,"
17999,CXXV,"Is Altamore, the king of Samarcand!"
18000,CXXV,"Adrastus then, whose realm lies near the morn,"
18001,CXXV,"A hardy giant, bold, and strong of hand,"
18002,CXXV,"This king upon an elephant is borne,"
18003,CXXV,For under him no horse can stir or stand;
18004,CXXV,"The third is Tisipherne, as brave a lord"
18005,CXXV,As ever put on helm or girt on sword.”
18006,CXXV,
18007,CXXVI,CXXVI
18008,CXXVI,"This said, from young Rinaldo’s angry eyes,"
18009,CXXVI,"Flew sparks of wrath, flames in his visage shined,"
18010,CXXVI,"He longed to be amid those enemies,"
18011,CXXVI,Nor rest nor reason in his heart could find.
18012,CXXVI,"But to the Duke Vafrine his talk applies,"
18013,CXXVI,"“The greatest news, my lord, are yet behind,"
18014,CXXVI,"For all their thoughts, their crafts and counsels tend"
18015,CXXVI,By treason false to bring thy life to end.”
18016,CXXVI,
18017,CXXVII,CXXVII
18018,CXXVII,Then all from point to point he gan expose
18019,CXXVII,"The false compact, how it was made and wrought,"
18020,CXXVII,"The arms and ensigns feigned, poison close,"
18021,CXXVII,"Ormondo’s vaunt, what praise, what thank he sought,"
18022,CXXVII,"And what reward, and satisfied all those"
18023,CXXVII,"That would demand, inquire, or ask of aught."
18024,CXXVII,"Silence was made awhile, when Godfrey thus,—"
18025,CXXVII,"“Raymondo, say, what counsel givest thou us?”"
18026,CXXVII,
18027,CXXVIII,CXXVIII
18028,CXXVIII,"“Not as we purposed late, next morn,” quoth he,"
18029,CXXVIII,"“Let us not scale, but round besiege this tower,"
18030,CXXVIII,That those within may have no issue free
18031,CXXVIII,"To sally out, and hurt us with their power,"
18032,CXXVIII,"Our camp well rested and refreshed see,"
18033,CXXVIII,"Provided well gainst this last storm and shower,"
18034,CXXVIII,"And then in pitched field, fight, if you will;"
18035,CXXVIII,"If not, delay and keep this fortress still."

18041,CXXIX,Who else can rule or guide these squadrons brave?
18042,CXXIX,"And for the traitors shall be noted plain,"
18043,CXXIX,"Command your guard to change the arms they have,"
18044,CXXIX,"So shall their guile be known, in their own net"

18051,CXXX,We will their force in pitched battle prove;
18052,CXXX,"Closed in this wall and trench, the fight to shun,"
18053,CXXX,"Doth ill this camp beseem, and worse behove,"

18348,XXVII,"Thus many words in several tongues he spake,"
18349,XXVII,And all his sundry nations to sharp fight

18354,XXVIII,"It was a great, a strange and wondrous sight,"
18355,XXVIII,"When front to front those noble armies met,"
18356,XXVIII,"How every troop, how in each troop each knight"
18357,XXVIII,"Stood prest to move, to fight, and praise to get,"
18358,XXVIII,"Loose in the wind waved their ensigns light,"
18359,XXVIII,Trembled the plumes that on their crests were set;
18360,XXVIII,"Their arms, impresses, colors, gold and stone,"
18361,XXVIII,"Against the sunbeams smiled, flamed, sparkled, shone."
18362,XXVIII,
18363,XXIX,XXIX
18364,XXIX,"Of dry topped oaks they seemed two forests thick,"
18365,XXIX,"So did each host with spears and pikes abound,"
18366,XXIX,"Bent were their bows, in rests their lances stick,"
18367,XXIX,"Their hands shook swords, their slings held cobbles round:"
18368,XXIX,"Each steed to run was ready, prest and quick,"
18369,XXIX,"At his commander’s spur, his hand, his sound,"
18370,XXIX,"He chafes, he stamps, careers, and turns about,"
18371,XXIX,"He foams, snorts, neighs, and fire and smoke breathes out."
18372,XXIX,
18373,XXX,XXX
18374,XXX,"Horror itself in that fair sight seemed fair,"
18375,XXX,And pleasure flew amid sad dread and fear;
18376,XXX,"The trumpets shrill, that thundered in the air,"
18377,XXX,Were music mild and sweet to every ear:
18378,XXX,"The faithful camp, though less, yet seemed more rare"
18379,XXX,"In that strange noise, more warlike, shrill and clear,"
18380,XXX,"In notes more sweet, the Pagan trumpets jar,"
18381,XXX,"These sung, their armors shined, these glistered far."
18382,XXX,
18383,XXXI,XXXI
18384,XXXI,"The Christian trumpets give the deadly call,"
18385,XXXI,"The Pagans answer, and the fight accept;"
18386,XXXI,The godly Frenchmen on their knees down fall
18387,XXXI,"To pray, and kissed the earth, and then up leapt"
18388,XXXI,"To fight, the land between was vanished all,"
18389,XXXI,In combat close each host to other stepped;
18390,XXXI,"For now the wings had skirmish hot begun,"
18391,XXXI,And with their battles forth the footmen run.
18392,XXXI,
18393,XXXII,XXXII
18394,XXXII,"But who was first of all the Christian train,"
18395,XXXII,"That gave the onset first, first won renown?"
18396,XXXII,"Gildippes thou wert she, for by thee slain"
18397,XXXII,"The King of Orms, Hircano, tumbled down,"
18398,XXXII,"The man’s breastbone thou clov’st and rent in twain,"
18399,XXXII,"So Heaven with honor would thee bless and crown,"
18400,XXXII,"Pierced through he fell, and falling hard withal"
18401,XXXII,His foe praised for her strength and for his fall.
18402,XXXII,
18403,XXXIII,XXXIII
18404,XXXIII,"Her lance thus broke, the hardy dame forth drew"
18405,XXXIII,"With her strong hand a fine and trenchant blade,"
18406,XXXIII,"And gainst the Persians fierce and bold she flew,"
18407,XXXIII,"And in their troop wide streets and lanes she made,"
18408,XXXIII,Even in the girdling-stead divided new
18409,XXXIII,"In pieces twain, Zopire on earth she laid;"
18410,XXXIII,"And then Alarco’s head she swept off clean,"
18411,XXXIII,Which like a football tumbled on the green.
18412,XXXIII,
18413,XXXIV,XXXIV
18414,XXXIV,"A blow felled Artaxerxes, with a thrust"
18415,XXXIV,"Was Argeus slain, the first lay in a trance,"
18416,XXXIV,"Ismael’s left hand cut off fell in the dust,"
18417,XXXIV,For on his wrist her sword fell down by chance:
18418,XXXIV,"The hand let go the bridle where it lust,"
18419,XXXIV,"The blow upon the courser’s ears did glance,"
18420,XXXIV,"Who felt the reins at large, and with the stroke"
18421,XXXIV,"Half mad, the ranks disordered, troubled, broke."
18422,XXXIV,
18423,XXXV,XXXV
18424,XXXV,"All these, and many mo, by time forgot,"
18425,XXXV,"She slew and wounded, when against her came"
18426,XXXV,"The angry Persians all, cast on a knot,"
18427,XXXV,For on her person would they purchase fame:
18428,XXXV,But her dear spouse and husband wanted not
18429,XXXV,"In so great need, to aid the noble dame;"
18430,XXXV,"Thus joined, the haps of war unhurt they prove,"
18431,XXXV,"Their strength was double, double was their love."
18432,XXXV,
18433,XXXVI,XXXVI
18434,XXXVI,"The noble lovers use well might you see,"
18435,XXXVI,"A wondrous guise, till then unseen, unheard,"
18436,XXXVI,"To save themselves forgot both he and she,"
18437,XXXVI,"Each other’s life did keep, defend, and guard;"
18438,XXXVI,"The strokes that gainst her lord discharged be,"
18439,XXXVI,"The dame had care to bear, to break, to ward,"
18440,XXXVI,"His shield kept off the blows bent on his dear,"
18441,XXXVI,"Which, if need be, his naked head should bear."
18442,XXXVI,
18443,XXXVII,XXXVII
18444,XXXVII,"So each saved other, each for other’s wrong"
18445,XXXVII,"Would vengeance take, but not revenge their own:"
18446,XXXVII,The valiant Soldan Artabano strong
18447,XXXVII,"Of Boecan Isle, by her was overthrown,"
18448,XXXVII,"And by his hand, the bodies dead among,"
18449,XXXVII,"Alvante, that durst his mistress wound, fell down,"
18450,XXXVII,"And she between the eyes hit Arimont,"
18451,XXXVII,"Who hurt her lord, and cleft in twain his front."
18452,XXXVII,
18453,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
18454,XXXVIII,But Altamore who had that wing to lead
18455,XXXVIII,Far greater slaughter on the Christians made;
18456,XXXVIII,"For where he turned his sword, or twined his steed,"
18457,XXXVIII,"He slew, or man and beast on earth down laid,"
18458,XXXVIII,"Happy was he that was at first struck dead,"
18459,XXXVIII,"That fell not down on live, for whom his blade"
18460,XXXVIII,"Had speared, the same cast in the dusty street"
18461,XXXVIII,"His horse tore with his teeth, bruised with his feet."
18462,XXXVIII,
18463,XXXIX,XXXIX
18464,XXXIX,"By this brave Persian’s valor, killed and slain"
18465,XXXIX,Were strong Brunello and Ardonia great;
18466,XXXIX,"The first his head and helm had cleft in twain,"
18467,XXXIX,"The last in stranger-wise he did intreat,"
18468,XXXIX,"For through his heart he pierced, and through the vein"
18469,XXXIX,"Where laughter hath his fountain and his seat,"
18470,XXXIX,"So that, a dreadful thing, believed uneath,"
18471,XXXIX,"He laughed for pain, and laughed himself to death."
18472,XXXIX,
18473,XL,XL
18474,XL,"Nor these alone with that accursed knife,"
18475,XL,Of this sweet light and breath deprived lie;
18476,XL,But with that cruel weapon lost their life
18477,XL,"Gentonio, Guascar, Rosimond, and Guy;"
18478,XL,Who knows how many in that fatal strife
18479,XL,He slew?  what knights his courser fierce made die?
18480,XL,The names and countries of the people slain
18481,XL,Who tells?  their wounds and deaths who can explain?
18482,XL,
18483,XLI,XLI
18484,XLI,With this fierce king encounter durst not one.
18485,XLI,"Not one durst combat him in equal field,"
18486,XLI,Gildippes undertook that task alone;
18487,XLI,"No doubt could make her shrink, no danger yield,"
18488,XLI,"By Thermodont was never Amazone,"
18489,XLI,"Who managed steeled axe, or carried shield,"
18490,XLI,"That seemed so bold as she, so strong, so light,"
18491,XLI,When forth she run to meet that dreadful knight.
18492,XLI,
18493,XLII,XLII
18494,XLII,"She hit him, where with gold and rich anmail,"
18495,XLII,"His diadem did on his helmet flame,"
18496,XLII,"She broke and cleft the crown, and caused him veil"
18497,XLII,"His proud and lofty top, his crest down came,"
18498,XLII,Strong seemed her arm that could so well assail:
18499,XLII,"The Pagan shook for spite and blushed for shame,"
18500,XLII,"Forward he rushed, and would at once requite"
18501,XLII,"Shame with disgrace, and with revenge despite."
18502,XLII,
18503,XLIII,XLIII
18504,XLIII,Right on the front he gave that lady kind
18505,XLIII,"A blow so huge, so strong, so great, so sore,"
18506,XLIII,"That out of sense and feeling, down she twined:"
18507,XLIII,"But her dear knight his love from ground upbore,"
18508,XLIII,"Were it their fortune, or his noble mind,"
18509,XLIII,He stayed his hand and strook the dame no more:
18510,XLIII,"A lion so stalks by, and with proud eyes"
18511,XLIII,"Beholds, but scorns to hurt a man that lies."
18512,XLIII,
18513,XLIV,XLIV
18514,XLIV,"This while Ormondo false, whose cruel hand"
18515,XLIV,"Was armed and prest to give the trait’rous blow,"
18516,XLIV,With all his fellows mongst Godfredo’s band
18517,XLIV,"Entered unseen, disguised that few them know:"
18518,XLIV,"The thievish wolves, when night o’ershades the land,"
18519,XLIV,"That seem like faithful dogs in shape and show,"
18520,XLIV,"So to the closed folds in secret creep,"
18521,XLIV,And entrance seek; to kill some harmless sheep.
18522,XLIV,
18523,XLV,XLV
18524,XLV,"He proached nigh, and to Godfredo’s side"
18525,XLV,The bloody Pagan now was placed near:
18526,XLV,"But when his colors gold and white he spied,"
18527,XLV,"And saw the other signs that forged were,"
18528,XLV,"“See, see, this traitor false!” the captain cried,"
18529,XLV,"“That like a Frenchman would in show appear,"
18530,XLV,Behold how near his mates and he are crept!”
18531,XLV,"This said, upon the villain forth he leapt;"
18532,XLV,
18533,LXVI,LXVI
18534,LXVI,"Deadly he wounded him, and that false knight"
18535,LXVI,Nor strikes nor wards nor striveth to be gone;
18536,LXVI,"But, as Medusa’s head were in his sight,"
18537,LXVI,"Stood like a man new turned to marble stone,"
18538,LXVI,"All lances broke, unsheathed all weapons bright,"
18539,LXVI,"All quivers emptied were on them alone,"
18540,LXVI,"In parts so many were the traitors cleft,"
18541,LXVI,That those dead men had no dead bodies left.
18542,LXVI,
18543,LXVII,LXVII
18544,LXVII,"When Godfrey was with Pagan blood bespread,"
18545,LXVII,He entered then the fight and that was past
18546,LXVII,"Where the bold Persian fought and combated,"
18547,LXVII,"Where the close ranks he opened, cleft and brast;"
18548,LXVII,"Before the knight the troops and squadrons fled,"
18549,LXVII,As Afric dust before the southern blast;
18550,LXVII,"The Duke recalled them, in array them placed,"
18551,LXVII,"Stayed those that fled, and him assailed that chased."
18552,LXVII,
18553,LXVIII,LXVIII
18554,LXVIII,"The champions strong there fought a battle stout,"
18555,LXVIII,Troy never saw the like by Xanthus old:
18556,LXVIII,A conflict sharp there was meanwhile on foot
18557,LXVIII,Twixt Baldwin good and Muleasses bold:
18558,LXVIII,"The horsemen also near the mountains root,"
18559,LXVIII,"And in both wings, a furious skirmish hold,"
18560,LXVIII,"And where the barbarous duke in person stood,"
18561,LXVIII,Twixt Tisiphernes and Adrastus proud;
18562,LXVIII,
18563,XLIX,XLIX
18564,XLIX,"With Emiren Robert the Norman strove,"
18565,XLIX,"Long time they fought, yet neither lost nor won;"
18566,XLIX,"The other Robert’s helm the Indian clove,"
18567,XLIX,"And broke his arms, their fight would soon be done:"
18568,XLIX,"From place to place did Tisiphernes rove,"
18569,XLIX,"And found no match, against him none dust run,"
18570,XLIX,But where the press was thickest thither flew
18571,XLIX,"The knight, and at each stroke felled, hurt, or slew."
18572,XLIX,
18573,L,L
18574,L,"Thus fought they long, yet neither shrink nor yield,"
18575,L,In equal balance hung their hope and fear:
18576,L,"All full of broken lances lay the field,"
18577,L,All full of arms that cloven and shattered were;
18578,L,"Of swords, some to the body nail the shield,"
18579,L,"Some cut men’s throats, and some their bellies tear;"
18580,L,"Of bodies, some upright, some grovelling lay,"
18581,L,And for themselves eat graves out of the clay.
18582,L,
18583,LI,LI
18584,LI,"Beside his lord slain lay the noble steed,"
18585,LI,"There friend with friend lay killed like lovers true,"
18586,LI,"There foe with foe, the live under the dead,"
18587,LI,The victor under him whom late he slew:
18588,LI,"A hoarse unperfect sound did eachwhere spread,"
18589,LI,"Whence neither silence, nor plain outcries flew:"
18590,LI,"There fury roars, ire threats, and woe complains,"
18591,LI,"One weeps, another cries, he sighs for pains."
18592,LI,
18593,LII,LII
18594,LII,"The arms that late so fair and glorious seem,"
18595,LII,"Now soiled and slubbered, sad and sullen grow,"
18596,LII,"The steel his brightness lost, the gold his beam;"
18597,LII,The colors had no pride nor beauty’s show;
18598,LII,"The plumes and feathers on their crests that stream,"
18599,LII,Are strowed wide upon the earth below:
18600,LII,"The hosts both clad in blood, in dust and mire,"
18601,LII,"Had changed their cheer, their pride, their rich attire."
18602,LII,
18603,LIII,LIII
18604,LIII,"But now the Moors, Arabians, Ethiops black,"
18605,LIII,"Of the left wing that held the utmost marge,"
18606,LIII,"Spread forth their troops, and purposed at the back"
18607,LIII,And side their heedless foes to assail and charge:
18608,LIII,Slingers and archers were not slow nor slack
18609,LIII,"To shoot and cast, when with his battle large"
18610,LIII,"Rinaldo came, whose fury, haste and ire,"
18611,LIII,"Seemed earthquake, thunder, tempest, storm and fire."
18612,LIII,
18613,LIV,LIV
18614,LIV,"The first he met was Asimire, his throne"
18615,LIV,"That set in Meroe’s hot sunburnt land,"
18616,LIV,"He cut his neck in twain, flesh, skin and bone,"
18617,LIV,The sable head down tumbled on the sand;
18618,LIV,But when by death of this black prince alone
18619,LIV,"The taste of blood and conquest once he fand,"
18620,LIV,"Whole squadrons then, whole troops to earth he brought,"
18621,LIV,"Things wondrous, strange, incredible he wrought."
18622,LIV,
18623,LV,LV
18624,LV,"He gave more deaths than strokes, and yet his blows"
18625,LV,"Upon his feeble foes fell oft and thick,"
18626,LV,"To move three tongues as a fierce serpent shows,"
18627,LV,"Which rolls the one she hath swift, speedy, quick,"
18628,LV,So thinks each Pagan; each Arabian trows
18629,LV,"He wields three swords, all in one hilt that stick;"
18630,LV,"His readiness their eyes so blinded hath,"
18631,LV,"Their dread that wonder bred, fear gave it faith."
18632,LV,
18633,LVI,LVI
18634,LVI,The Afric tyrants and the negro kings
18635,LVI,"Fell down on heaps, drowned each in other’s blood,"
18636,LVI,"Upon their people ran the knights he brings,"
18637,LVI,"Pricked forward by their guide’s example good,"
18638,LVI,"Killed were the Pagans, broke their bows and slings:"
18639,LVI,"Some died, some fell; some yielded, none withstood:"
18640,LVI,"A massacre was this, no fight; these put"
18641,LVI,"Their foes to death, those hold their throats to cut."
18642,LVI,
18643,LVII,LVII
18644,LVII,"Small while they stood, with heart and hardy face,"
18645,LVII,"On their bold breasts deep wounds and hurts to bear,"
18646,LVII,"But fled away, and troubled in the chase"
18647,LVII,Their ranks disordered be with too much fear:
18648,LVII,"Rinaldo followed them from place to place,"
18649,LVII,Till quite discomfit and dispersed they were.
18650,LVII,"That done, he stays, and all his knights recalls,"
18651,LVII,And scorns to strike his foe that flies or falls.
18652,LVII,
18653,LVIII,LVIII
18654,LVIII,"Like as the wind stopped by some wood or hill,"
18655,LVIII,"Grows strong and fierce, tears boughs and trees in twain,"
18656,LVIII,"But with mild blasts, more temperate, gentle, still,"
18657,LVIII,Blows through the ample field or spacious plain;
18658,LVIII,"Against the rocks as sea-waves murmur shrill,"
18659,LVIII,But silent pass amid the open main:
18660,LVIII,"Rinaldo so, when none his force withstood,"
18661,LVIII,"Assuaged his fury, calmed his angry mood;"
18662,LVIII,
18663,LIX,LIX
18664,LIX,He scorned upon their fearful backs that fled
18665,LIX,"To wreak his ire and spend his force in vain,"
18666,LIX,"But gainst the footmen strong his troops he led,"
18667,LIX,"Whose side the Moors had open left and plain,"
18668,LIX,The Africans that should have succored
18669,LIX,"That battle, all were run away or slain,"
18670,LIX,Upon their flank with force and courage stout
18671,LIX,His men at arms assailed the bands on foot:
18672,LIX,
18673,LX,LX
18674,LX,"He brake their pikes, and brake their close array,"
18675,LX,"Entered their battle, felled them down around,"
18676,LX,So wind or tempest with impetuous sway
18677,LX,The ears of ripened corn strikes flat to ground:
18678,LX,"With blood, arms, bodies dead, the hardened clay"
18679,LX,"Plastered the earth, no grass nor green was found;"
18680,LX,"The horsemen running through and through their bands,"
18681,LX,"Kill, murder, slay, few scape, not one withstands."
18682,LX,
18683,LXI,LXI
18684,LXI,Rinaldo came where his forlorn Armide
18685,LXI,"Sate on her golden chariot mounted high,"
18686,LXI,A noble guard she had on every side
18687,LXI,"Of lords, of lovers, and much chivalry:"
18688,LXI,"She knew the man when first his arms she spied,"
18689,LXI,"Love, hate, wrath, sweet desire strove in her eye,"
18690,LXI,"He changed somedeal his look and countenance bold,"
18691,LXI,"She changed from frost to fire, from heat to cold."
18692,LXI,
18693,LXII,LXII
18694,LXII,The prince passed by the chariot of his dear
18695,LXII,"Like one that did his thoughts elsewhere bestow,"
18696,LXII,Yet suffered not her knights and lovers near
18697,LXII,"Their rival so to scape withouten blow,"
18698,LXII,"One drew his sword, another couched his spear,"
18699,LXII,"Herself an arrow sharp set in her bow,"
18700,LXII,"Disdain her ire new sharped and kindled hath,"
18701,LXII,"But love appeased her, love assuaged her wrath."
18702,LXII,
18703,LXIII,LXIII
18704,LXIII,"Love bridled fury, and revived of new"
18705,LXIII,"His fire, not dead, though buried in displeasure,"
18706,LXIII,"Three times her angry hand the bow updrew,"
18707,LXIII,And thrice again let slack the string at leisure;
18708,LXIII,"But wrath prevailed at last, the reed outflew,"
18709,LXIII,"For love finds mean, but hatred knows no measure,"
18710,LXIII,"Outflew the shaft, but with the shaft, this charm,"
18711,LXIII,This wish she sent: Heaven grant it do no harm:
18712,LXIII,
18713,LXIV,LXIV
18714,LXIV,"She bids the reed return the way it went,"
18715,LXIV,"And pierce her heart which so unkind could prove,"
18716,LXIV,"Such force had love, though lost and vainly spent,"
18717,LXIV,"What strength hath happy, kind and mutual love?"
18718,LXIV,"But she that gentle thought did straight repent,"
18719,LXIV,"Wrath, fury, kindness, in her bosom strove,"
18720,LXIV,"She would, she would not, that it missed or hit,"
18721,LXIV,"Her eyes, her heart, her wishes followed it."
18722,LXIV,
18723,LXV,LXV
18724,LXV,"But yet in vain the quarrel lighted not,"
18725,LXV,"For on his hauberk hard the knight it hit,"
18726,LXV,"Too hard for woman’s shaft or woman’s shot,"
18727,LXV,"Instead of piercing, there it broke and split;"
18728,LXV,"He turned away, she burnt with fury hot,"
18729,LXV,"And thought he scorned her power, and in that fit"
18730,LXV,"Shot oft and oft, her shafts no entrance found,"
18731,LXV,"And while she shot, love gave her wound on wound."
18732,LXV,
18733,LXVI,LXVI
18734,LXVI,"“And is he then unpierceable,” quoth she,"
18735,LXVI,“That neither force nor foe he needs regard?
18736,LXVI,"His limbs, perchance, armed with that hardness be,"
18737,LXVI,"Which makes his heart so cruel and so hard,"
18738,LXVI,No shot that flies from eye or hand I see
18739,LXVI,"Hurts him, such rigor doth his person guard,"
18740,LXVI,"Armed, or disarmed; his foe or mistress kind"
18741,LXVI,"Despised alike, like hate, like scorn I find."
18742,LXVI,
18743,LXVII,LXVII
18744,LXVII,"“But what new form is left, device or art,"
18745,LXVII,"By which, to which exchanged, I might find grace?"
18746,LXVII,"For in my knights, and all that take my part,"
18747,LXVII,"I see no help; no hope, no trust I place;"
18748,LXVII,"To his great prowess, might, and valiant heart,"
18749,LXVII,"All strength is weak, all courage vile and base.”"
18750,LXVII,"This said she, for she saw how through the field"
18751,LXVII,"Her champions fly, faint, tremble, fall and yield."
18752,LXVII,
18753,LXVIII,LXVIII
18754,LXVIII,"Nor left alone can she her person save,"
18755,LXVIII,"But to be slain or taken stands in fear,"
18756,LXVIII,"Though with a bow a javelin long she have,"
18757,LXVIII,"Yet weak was Phebe’s bow, blunt Pallas’ spear."
18758,LXVIII,"But, as the swan, that sees the eagle brave"
18759,LXVIII,"Threatening her flesh and silver plumes to tear,"
18760,LXVIII,"Falls down, to hide her mongst the shady brooks:"
18761,LXVIII,"Such were her fearful motions, such her looks."
18762,LXVIII,
18763,LXIX,LXIX
18764,LXIX,"But Altamore, this while that strove and sought"
18765,LXIX,"From shameful flight his Persian host to stay,"
18766,LXIX,"That was discomfit and destroyed to nought,"
18767,LXIX,"Whilst he alone maintained the fight and fray,"
18768,LXIX,"Seeing distressed the goddess of his thought,"
18769,LXIX,"To aid her ran, nay flew, and laid away"
18770,LXIX,All care both of his honor and his host:
18771,LXIX,"If she were safe, let all the world be lost."
18772,LXIX,
18773,LXX,LXX
18774,LXX,"To the ill-guarded chariot swift he flew,"
18775,LXX,His weapon made him way with bloody war:
18776,LXX,Meanwhile Lord Godfrey and Rinaldo slew
18777,LXX,"His feeble bands, his people murdered are,"
18778,LXX,"He saw their loss, but aided not his crew,"
18779,LXX,"A better lover than a leader far,"
18780,LXX,"He set Armida safe, then turned again"
18781,LXX,"With tardy succor, for his folk were slain."
18782,LXX,
18783,LXXI,LXXI
18784,LXXI,And on that side the woful prince beheld
18785,LXXI,"The battle lost, no help nor hope remained;"
18786,LXXI,"But on the other wing the Christians yield,"
18787,LXXI,"And fly, such vantage there the Egyptians gained,"
18788,LXXI,One of the Roberts was nigh slain in field;
18789,LXXI,The other by the Indian strong constrained
18790,LXXI,To yield himself his captive and his slave;
18791,LXXI,Thus equal loss and equal foil they have.
18792,LXXI,
18793,LXXII,LXXII
18794,LXXII,Godfredo took the time and season fit
18795,LXXII,"To bring again his squadrons in array,"
18796,LXXII,"And either camp well ordered, ranged and knit,"
18797,LXXII,"Renewed the furious battle, fight and fray,"
18798,LXXII,"New streams of blood were shed, new swords them hit;"
18799,LXXII,"New combats fought, new spoils were borne away,"
18800,LXXII,"And unresolved and doubtful, on each side,"
18801,LXXII,"Did praise and conquest, Mars and Fortune ride."
18802,LXXII,
18803,LXXIII,LXXIII
18804,LXXIII,Between the armies twain while thus the fight
18805,LXXIII,"Waxed sharp, hot, cruel, though renewed but late,"
18806,LXXIII,"The Soldan clomb up to the tower’s height,"
18807,LXXIII,"And saw far off their strife and fell debate,"
18808,LXXIII,As from some stage or theatre the knight
18809,LXXIII,"Saw played the tragedy of human state,"
18810,LXXIII,"Saw death, blood, murder, woe and horror strange,"
18811,LXXIII,"And the great acts of fortune, chance, and change."
18812,LXXIII,
18813,LXXIV,LXXIV
18814,LXXIV,At first astonished and amazed he stood
18815,LXXIV,"Then burnt with wrath, and self-consuming ire,"
18816,LXXIV,"Swelled his bosom like a raging flood,"
18817,LXXIV,"To be amid that battle; such desire,"
18818,LXXIV,"Such haste he had; he donned his helmet good,"
18819,LXXIV,"His other arms he had before entire,"
18820,LXXIV,"“Up, up!” he cried, “no more, no more, within"
18821,LXXIV,"This fortress stay, come follow, die or win.”"
18822,LXXIV,
18823,LXXV,LXXV
18824,LXXV,Whether the same were Providence divine
18825,LXXV,"That made him leave the fortress he possessed,"
18826,LXXV,For that the empire proud of Palestine
18827,LXXV,"This day should fall, to rise again more blessed;"
18828,LXXV,Or that he breaking felt the fatal line
18829,LXXV,"Of life, and would meet death with constant breast,"
18830,LXXV,"Furious and fierce he did the gates unbar,"
18831,LXXV,"And sudden rage brought forth, and sudden war."
18832,LXXV,
18833,LXXVI,LXXVI
18834,LXXVI,Nor stayed he till the folk on whom he cried
18835,LXXVI,"Assemble might, but out alone he flies,"
18836,LXXVI,"A thousand foes the man alone defied,"
18837,LXXVI,And ran among a thousand enemies:
18838,LXXVI,"But with his fury called from every side,"
18839,LXXVI,"The rest run out, and Aladine forth hies,"
18840,LXXVI,"The cowards had no fear, the wise no care,"
18841,LXXVI,"This was not hope, nor courage, but despair."
18842,LXXVI,
18843,LXXVII,LXXVII
18844,LXXVII,The dreadful Turk with sudden blows down cast
18845,LXXVII,"The first he met, nor gave them time to plain"
18846,LXXVII,"Or pray, in murdering them he made such haste"
18847,LXXVII,That dead they fell ere one could see them slain;
18848,LXXVII,"From mouth to mouth, from eye to eye forth passed"
18849,LXXVII,"The fear and terror, that the faithful train"
18850,LXXVII,"Of Syrian folk, not used to dangerous fight,"
18851,LXXVII,"Were broken, scattered, and nigh put to flight."
18852,LXXVII,
18853,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
18854,LXXVIII,"But with less terror, and disorder less,"
18855,LXXVIII,"The Gascoigns kept array, and kept their ground,"
18856,LXXVIII,"Though most the loss and peril them oppress,"
18857,LXXVIII,"Unwares assailed they were, unready found."
18858,LXXVIII,No ravening tooth or talon hard I guess
18859,LXXVIII,"Of beast or eager hawk, doth slay and wound"
18860,LXXVIII,"So many sheep or fowls, weak, feeble, small,"
18861,LXXVIII,As his sharp sword killed knights and soldiers tall.
18862,LXXVIII,
18863,LXXIX,LXXIX
18864,LXXIX,It seemed his thirst and hunger ’suage he would
18865,LXXIX,"With their slain bodies, and their blood poured out,"
18866,LXXIX,With him his troops and Aladino old
18867,LXXIX,"Slew their besiegers, killed the Gascoign rout:"
18868,LXXIX,"But Raymond ran to meet the Soldan bold,"
18869,LXXIX,"Nor to encounter him had fear or doubt,"
18870,LXXIX,"Though his right hand by proof too well he know,"
18871,LXXIX,Which laid him late for dead at one huge blow.
18872,LXXIX,
18873,LXXX,LXXX
18874,LXXX,"They met, and Raymond fell amid the field,"
18875,LXXX,"This blow again upon his forehead light,"
18876,LXXX,"It was the fault and weakness of his eild,"
18877,LXXX,"Age is not fit to bear strokes of such might,"
18878,LXXX,"Each one lift up his sword, advanced his shield,"
18879,LXXX,"Those would destroy, and these defend the knight."
18880,LXXX,"On went the Soldan, for the man he thought"
18881,LXXX,"Was slain, or easily might be captive brought."
18882,LXXX,
18883,LXXXI,LXXXI
18884,LXXXI,"Among the rest he ran, he raged, he smote,"
18885,LXXXI,"And in small space, small time, great wonders wrought"
18886,LXXXI,"And as his rage him led and fury hot,"
18887,LXXXI,"To kill and murder, matter new he sought:"
18888,LXXXI,As from his supper poor with hungry throat
18889,LXXXI,"A peasant hastes, to a rich feast ybrought;"
18890,LXXXI,So from this skirmish to the battle great
18891,LXXXI,"He ran, and quenched with blood his fury’s heat."
18892,LXXXI,
18893,LXXXII,LXXXII
18894,LXXXII,"Where battered was the wall he sallied out,"
18895,LXXXII,"And to the field in haste and heat he goes,"
18896,LXXXII,"With him went rage and fury, fear and doubt"
18897,LXXXII,"Remained behind, among his scattered foes:"
18898,LXXXII,"To win the conquest strove his squadron stout,"
18899,LXXXII,Which he unperfect left; yet loth to lose
18900,LXXXII,"The day, the Christians fight, resist and die,"
18901,LXXXII,"And ready were to yield, retire and fly."
18902,LXXXII,
18903,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
18904,LXXXIII,"The Gascoign bands retired, but kept array,"
18905,LXXXIII,"The Syrian people ran away outright,"
18906,LXXXIII,"The fight was near the place where Tancred lay,"
18907,LXXXIII,"His house was full of noise and great affright,"
18908,LXXXIII,"He rose and looked forth to see the fray,"
18909,LXXXIII,"Though every limb were weak, faint, void of might;"
18910,LXXXIII,"He saw the country lie, his men o’erthrown,"
18911,LXXXIII,"Some beaten back, some killed, some felled down."
18912,LXXXIII,
18913,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
18914,LXXXIV,"Courage in noble hearts that ne’er is spent,"
18915,LXXXIV,"Yet fainted not, though faint were every limb,"
18916,LXXXIV,"But reinforced each member cleft and rent,"
18917,LXXXIV,And want of blood and strength supplied in him;
18918,LXXXIV,"In his left hand his heavy shield he hent,"
18919,LXXXIV,"Nor seemed the weight too great, his curtlax trim"
18920,LXXXIV,"His right hand drew, nor for more arms he stood"
18921,LXXXIV,"Or stayed, he needs no more whose heart is good:"
18922,LXXXIV,
18923,LXXXV,LXXXV
18924,LXXXV,"But coming forth, cried, “Whither will you run,"
18925,LXXXV,And leave your leader to his foes in prey?
18926,LXXXV,"What!  shall these heathen of his armor won,"
18927,LXXXV,In their vile temples hang up trophies gay?
18928,LXXXV,"Go home to Gascoign then, and tell his son"
18929,LXXXV,"That where his father died, you ran away:”"
18930,LXXXV,"This said, against a thousand armed foes,"
18931,LXXXV,"He did his breast weak, naked, sick, oppose."
18932,LXXXV,
18933,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
18934,LXXXVI,"And with his heavy, strong and mighty targe,"
18935,LXXXVI,"That with seven hard bulls’ hides was surely lined,"
18936,LXXXVI,And strengthened with a cover thick and large
18937,LXXXVI,"Of stiff and well-attempered steel behind,"
18938,LXXXVI,"He shielded Raymond from the furious charge,"
18939,LXXXVI,"From swords, from darts, from weapons of each kind,"
18940,LXXXVI,"And all his foes drove back with his sharp blade,"
18941,LXXXVI,"That sure and safe he lay, as in a shade."
18942,LXXXVI,
18943,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
18944,LXXXVII,"Thus saved, thus shielded, Raymond ’gan respire,"
18945,LXXXVII,"He rose and reared himself in little space,"
18946,LXXXVII,And in his bosom burned the double fire
18947,LXXXVII,Of vengeance; wrath his heart; shame filled his face;
18948,LXXXVII,"He looked around to spy, such was his ire,"
18949,LXXXVII,"The man whose stroke had laid him in that place,"
18950,LXXXVII,"Whom when he sees not, for disdain he quakes,"
18951,LXXXVII,And on his people sharp revengement takes.
18952,LXXXVII,
18953,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
18954,LXXXVIII,"The Gascoigns turn again, their lord in haste"
18955,LXXXVIII,"To venge their loss his band recorded brings,"
18956,LXXXVIII,"The troop that durst so much now stood aghast,"
18957,LXXXVIII,"For where sad fear grew late, now boldness springs,"
18958,LXXXVIII,"Now followed they that fled, fled they that chased;"
18959,LXXXVIII,"So in one hour altereth the state of things,"
18960,LXXXVIII,"Raymond requites his loss, shame, hurt and all,"
18961,LXXXVIII,And with an hundred deaths revenged one fall.
18962,LXXXVIII,
18963,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
18964,LXXXIX,Whilst Raymond wreaked thus his just disdain
18965,LXXXIX,"On the proud-heads of captains, lords and peers,"
18966,LXXXIX,"He spies great Sion’s king amid the train,"
18967,LXXXIX,"And to him leaps, and high his sword he rears,"
18968,LXXXIX,"And on his forehead strikes, and strikes again,"
18969,LXXXIX,"Till helm and head he breaks, he cleaves, he tears;"
18970,LXXXIX,"Down fell the king, the guiltless land he bit,"
18971,LXXXIX,"That now keeps him, because he kept not it."
18972,LXXXIX,
18973,XC,XC
18974,XC,"Their guides, one murdered thus, the other gone,"
18975,XC,"The troops divided were, in diverse thought,"
18976,XC,"Despair made some run headlong gainst their fone,"
18977,XC,"To seek sharp death that comes uncalled, unsought;"
18978,XC,"And some, that laid their hope on flight alone,"
18979,XC,"Fled to their fort again; yet chance so wrought,"
18980,XC,"That with the flyers in the victors pass,"
18981,XC,And so the fortress won and conquered was.
18982,XC,
18983,XCI,XCI
18984,XCI,"The hold was won, slain were the men that fled,"
18985,XCI,"In courts, halls, chambers high; above, below,"
18986,XCI,"Old Raymond fast up to the leads him sped,"
18987,XCI,"And there, of victory true sign and show,"
18988,XCI,"His glorious standard to the wind he spread,"
18989,XCI,That so both armies his success might know.
18990,XCI,"But Solyman saw not the town was lost,"
18991,XCI,"For far from thence he was, and near the host;"
18992,XCI,
18993,XCII,XCII
18994,XCII,"Into the field he came, the lukewarm blood"
18995,XCII,"Did smoke and flow through all the purple field,"
18996,XCII,"There of sad death the court and palace stood,"
18997,XCII,"There did he triumphs lead, and trophies build;"
18998,XCII,"An armed steed fast by the Soldan yood,"
18999,XCII,"That had no guide, nor lord the reins to wield,"
19000,XCII,"The tyrant took the bridle, and bestrode"
19001,XCII,"The courser’s empty back, and forth he rode."
19002,XCII,
19003,XCIII,XCIII
19004,XCIII,"Great, yet but short and sudden was the aid"
19005,XCIII,"That to the Pagans, faint and weak, he brought,"
19006,XCIII,"A thunderbolt he was, you would have said,"
19007,XCIII,"Great, yet that comes and goes as swift as thought"
19008,XCIII,And of his coming swift and flight unstayed
19009,XCIII,"Eternal signs in hardest rocks hath wrought,"
19010,XCIII,"For by his hand a hundred knights were slain,"
19011,XCIII,But time forgot hath all their names but twain;
19012,XCIII,
19013,XCIV,XCIV
19014,XCIV,"Gildippes fair, and Edward thy dear lord,"
19015,XCIV,"Your noble death, sad end, and woful fate,"
19016,XCIV,"If so much power our vulgar tongue afford,"
19017,XCIV,"To all strange wits, strange ears let me dilate,"
19018,XCIV,"That ages all your love and sweet accord,"
19019,XCIV,"Your virtue, prowess, worth may imitate,"
19020,XCIV,"And some kind servant of true love that hears,"
19021,XCIV,"May grace your death, my verses, with some tears."
19022,XCIV,
19023,XCV,XCV
19024,XCV,"The noble lady thither boldly flew,"
19025,XCV,"Where first the Soldan fought, and him defied,"
19026,XCV,"Two mighty blows she gave the Turk untrue,"
19027,XCV,"One cleft his shield, the other pierced his side;"
19028,XCV,"The prince the damsel by her habit knew,"
19029,XCV,"“See, see this mankind strumpet, see,” he cried,"
19030,XCV,"“This shameless whore, for thee fit weapons were"
19031,XCV,"Thy neeld and spindle, not a sword and spear.”"
19032,XCV,
19033,XCVI,XCVI
19034,XCVI,"This said, full of disdain, rage and despite,"
19035,XCVI,"A strong, a fierce, a deadly stroke he gave,"
19036,XCVI,"And pierced her armor, pierced her bosom white,"
19037,XCVI,"Worthy no blows, but blows of love to have:"
19038,XCVI,"Her dying hand let go the bridle quite,"
19039,XCVI,"She faints, she falls, ’twixt life and death she strave,"
19040,XCVI,"Her lord to help her came, but came too late,"
19041,XCVI,"Yet was not that his fault, it was his fate."
19042,XCVI,
19043,XCVII,XCVII
19044,XCVII,What should he do?  to diverse parts him call
19045,XCVII,"Just ire and pity kind, one bids him go"
19046,XCVII,"And succor his dear lady, like to fall,"
19047,XCVII,The other calls for vengeance on his foe;
19048,XCVII,"Love biddeth both, love says he must do all,"
19049,XCVII,"And with his ire joins grief, with pity woe."
19050,XCVII,What did he then?  with his left hand the knight
19051,XCVII,"Would hold her up, revenge her with his right."
19052,XCVII,
19053,XCVIII,XCVIII
19054,XCVIII,But to resist against a knight so bold
19055,XCVIII,Too weak his will and power divided were;
19056,XCVIII,"So that he could not his fair love uphold,"
19057,XCVIII,Nor kill the cruel man that slew his dear.
19058,XCVIII,"His arm that did his mistress kind enfold,"
19059,XCVIII,"The Turk cut off, pale grew his looks and cheer,"
19060,XCVIII,"He let her fall, himself fell by her side,"
19061,XCVIII,"And, for he could not save her, with her died."
19062,XCVIII,
19063,XCIX,XCIX
19064,XCIX,"As the high elm, whom his dear vine hath twined"
19065,XCIX,"Fast in her hundred arms and holds embraced,"
19066,XCIX,Bears down to earth his spouse and darling kind
19067,XCIX,"If storm or cruel steel the tree down cast,"
19068,XCIX,"And her full grapes to naught doth bruise and grind,"
19069,XCIX,"Spoils his own leaves, faints, withers, dies at last,"

19071,XCIX,"But for her death, with him that lies o’erthrown:"
19072,XCIX,
19073,C,C
19074,C,"So fell he mourning, mourning for the dame"

19083,CI,CI
19084,CI,"But now swift fame her nimble wings dispread,"

19086,CI,"Rinaldo heard the case, by one that fled"
19087,CI,From the fierce Turk and brought him news of all.
19088,CI,"Disdain, good-will, woe, wrath the champion led"
19089,CI,"To take revenge; shame, grief, for vengeance call;"
19090,CI,"But as he went, Adrastus with his blade"
19091,CI,"Forestalled the way, and show of combat made."

19093,CII,CII
19094,CII,"The giant cried, “By sundry signs I note"

19096,CII,"I marked each worthy’s shield, his helm, his coat,"
19097,CII,"And all this day have called and cried for thee,"
19098,CII,"To my sweet saint I have thy head devote,"

19107,CIII,But in his saddle made him bend and bow;
19108,CIII,"Rinaldo hit him on the flank so sore,"
19109,CIII,That neither art nor herb could help him now;
19110,CIII,"Down fell the giant strong, one blow such power,"

19138,CVI,"His eyes, that sparkled wrath and fury bold,"
19139,CVI,"Grew dim and feeble, fear had quenched that fire,"
19140,CVI,"And in his heart an hundred passions fought,"
19141,CVI,Yet none on fear or base retire he thought.
19142,CVI,
19143,CVII,CVII
19144,CVII,"While unresolved he stood, the victor knight"
19145,CVII,"Arrived, and seemed in quickness, haste and speed,"
19146,CVII,"In boldness, greatness, goodliness and might,"
19147,CVII,Above all princes born of human seed:
19148,CVII,"The Turk small while resists, not death nor fight"
19149,CVII,"Made him forget his state or race, through dreed,"
19150,CVII,"He fled no strokes, he fetched no groan nor sigh,"
19151,CVII,"Bold were his motions last, proud, stately, high."
19152,CVII,
19153,CVIII,CVIII
19154,CVIII,"Now when the Soldan, in these battles past"
19155,CVIII,"That Antheus-like oft fell oft rose again,"
19156,CVIII,"Evermore fierce, more fell, fell down at last"
19157,CVIII,"To lie forever, when this prince was slain,"
19158,CVIII,"Fortune, that seld is stable, firm or fast,"
19159,CVIII,"No longer durst resist the Christian train,"
19160,CVIII,"But ranged herself in row with Godfrey’s knights,"
19161,CVIII,"With them she serves, she runs, she rides, she fights."
19162,CVIII,
19163,CIX,CIX
19164,CIX,"The Pagan troops, the king’s own squadron fled,"
19165,CIX,"Of all the east, the strength, the pride, the flower,"
19166,CIX,"Late called Immortal, now discomfited,"
19167,CIX,"It lost that title proud, and lost all power;"
19168,CIX,"To him that with the royal standard fled,"
19169,CIX,"Thus Emireno said, with speeches sour,"
19170,CIX,“Art not thou he to whom to bear I gave
19171,CIX,"My king’s great banner, and his standard brave?"

19177,CX,"In battle strong, and runn’st thyself from fight?"
19178,CX,"What seek’st thou?  safety?  come, return with me,"
19179,CX,"The way to death is path to virtue right,"
19180,CX,Here let him fight that would escape; for this
19181,CX,"The way to honor, way to safety is.”"
19182,CX,
19183,CXI,CXI
19184,CXI,"The man returned and swelled with scorn and shame,"
19185,CXI,The duke with speeches grave exhorts the rest;
19186,CXI,"He threats, he strikes sometime, till back they came,"
19187,CXI,"And rage gainst force, despair gainst death addressed."
19188,CXI,Thus of his broken armies gan he frame
19189,CXI,"A battle now, some hope dwelt in his breast,"
19190,CXI,"But Tisiphernes bold revived him most,"
19191,CXI,"Who fought and seemed to win, when all was lost;"
19192,CXI,
19193,CXII,CXII
19194,CXII,"Wonders that day wrought noble Tisipherne,"
19195,CXII,The hardy Normans all he overthrew;
19196,CXII,"The Flemings fled before the champion stern,"
19197,CXII,"Gernier, Rogero, Gerard bold he slew;"
19198,CXII,His glorious deeds to praise and fame etern
19199,CXII,"His life’s short date prolonged, enlarged and drew,"
19200,CXII,"And then, as he that set sweet life at nought,"
19201,CXII,"The greatest peril, danger, most he sought."
19202,CXII,
19203,CXIII,CXIII
19204,CXIII,"He spied Rinaldo, and although his field"
19205,CXIII,"Of azure purple now and sanguine shows,"
19206,CXIII,And though the silver bird amid his shield
19207,CXIII,Were armed gules; yet he the champion knows.
19208,CXIII,"And says, “Here greatest peril is, heavens yield"
19209,CXIII,"Strength to my courage, fortune to my blows,"
19210,CXIII,"That fair Armida her revenge may see,"
19211,CXIII,"Help, Macon, for his arms I vow to thee.”"
19212,CXIII,
19213,CXIV,CXIV
19214,CXIV,"Thus prayed he, but all his vows were vain,"
19215,CXIV,"Mahound was deaf, or slept in heavens above,"
19216,CXIV,"And as a lion strikes him with his train,"
19217,CXIV,"His native wrath to quicken and to move,"
19218,CXIV,"So he awaked his fury and disdain,"
19219,CXIV,And sharped his courage on the whetstone love;
19220,CXIV,"Himself he saved behind his mighty targe,"
19221,CXIV,And forward spurred his steed and gave the charge.
19222,CXIV,
19223,CXV,CXV
19224,CXV,"The Christian saw the hardy warrior come,"
19225,CXV,"And leaped forth to undertake the fight,"
19226,CXV,"The people round about gave place and room,"
19227,CXV,"And wondered on that fierce and cruel sight,"
19228,CXV,"Some praised their strength, their skill and courage some,"
19229,CXV,"Such and so desperate blows struck either knight,"
19230,CXV,"That all that saw forgot both ire and strife,"
19231,CXV,"Their wounds, their hurts, forgot both death and life."
19232,CXV,
19233,CXVI,CXVI
19234,CXVI,"One struck, the other did both strike and wound,"
19235,CXVI,"His arms were surer, and his strength was more;"
19236,CXVI,From Tisipherne the blood streamed down around;
19237,CXVI,"His shield was cleft, his helm was rent and tore."
19238,CXVI,"The dame, that saw his blood besmear the ground,"
19239,CXVI,"His armor broke, limbs weak, wounds deep and sore,"
19240,CXVI,"And all her guard dead, fled, and overthrown,"
19241,CXVI,"Thought, now her field lay waste, her hedge lay down:"
19242,CXVI,
19243,CXVII,CXVII
19244,CXVII,"Environed with so brave a troop but late,"
19245,CXVII,"Now stood she in her chariot all alone,"
19246,CXVII,"She feared bondage, and her life did hate,"
19247,CXVII,"All hope of conquest and revenge was gone,"
19248,CXVII,"Half mad and half amazed from where she sate,"
19249,CXVII,"She leaped down, and fled from friends’ and fone,"
19250,CXVII,"On a swift horse she mounts, and forth she rides"
19251,CXVII,"Alone, save for disdain and love, her guides."
19252,CXVII,
19253,CXVIII,CXVIII
19254,CXVIII,"In days of old, Queen Cleopatra so"
19255,CXVIII,"Alone fled from the fight and cruel fray,"
19256,CXVIII,"Against Augustus great his happy foe,"
19257,CXVIII,Leaving her lord to loss and sure decay.
19258,CXVIII,"And as that lord for love let honor go,"
19259,CXVIII,Followed her flying sails and lost the day:
19260,CXVIII,So Tisipherne the fair and fearful dame
19261,CXVIII,"Would follow, but his foe forbids the same."
19262,CXVIII,
19263,CXIX,CXIX
19264,CXIX,"But when the Pagan’s joy and comfort fled,"
19265,CXIX,"It seemed the sun was set, the day was night,"
19266,CXIX,Gainst the brave prince with whom he combated
19267,CXIX,"He turned, and on the forehead struck the knight:"
19268,CXIX,"When thunders forged are in Typhoius’ bed,"
19269,CXIX,"Not Brontes’ hammer falls so swift, so right;"
19270,CXIX,"The furious stroke fell on Rinaldo’s crest,"
19271,CXIX,And made him bend his head down to his breast.
19272,CXIX,
19273,CXX,CXX
19274,CXX,"The champion in his stirrups high upstart,"
19275,CXX,"And cleft his hauberk hard and tender side,"
19276,CXX,"And sheathed his weapon in the Pagan’s heart,"
19277,CXX,The castle where man’s life and soul do bide;
19278,CXX,The cruel sword his breast and hinder part
19279,CXX,"With double wound unclosed, and opened wide;"
19280,CXX,"And two large doors made for his life and breath,"
19281,CXX,"Which passed, and cured hot love with frozen death."
19282,CXX,
19283,CXXI,CXXI
19284,CXXI,"This done, Rinaldo stayed and looked around,"
19285,CXXI,"Where he should harm his foes, or help his friends;"
19286,CXXI,Nor of the Pagans saw he squadron sound:
19287,CXXI,"Each standard falls, ensign to earth descends;"
19288,CXXI,"His fury quiet then and calm he found,"
19289,CXXI,"There all his wrath, his rage, and rancor ends,"
19290,CXXI,"He called to mind how, far from help or aid,"
19291,CXXI,"Armida fled, alone, amazed, afraid:"
19292,CXXI,
19293,CXXII,CXXII
19294,CXXII,"Well saw he when she fled, and with that sight"
19295,CXXII,"The prince had pity, courtesy and care;"
19296,CXXII,He promised her to be her friend and knight
19297,CXXII,When erst he left her in the island bare:
19298,CXXII,"The way she fled he ran and rode aright,"
19299,CXXII,Her palfrey’s feet signs in the grass outware:
19300,CXXII,"But she this while found out an ugly shade,"
19301,CXXII,"Fit place for death, where naught could life persuade."
19302,CXXII,
19303,CXXIII,CXXIII
19304,CXXIII,"Well pleased was she with those shadows brown,"
19305,CXXIII,"And yet displeased with luck, with life, with love;"
19306,CXXIII,"There from her steed she lighted, there laid down"
19307,CXXIII,"Her bow and shafts, her arms that helpless prove."
19308,CXXIII,"“There lie with shame,” she says, “disgraced, o’erthrown,"
19309,CXXIII,"Blunt are the weapons, blunt the arms I move,"
19310,CXXIII,"Weak to revenge my harms, or harm my foe,"
19311,CXXIII,"My shafts are blunt, ah, love, would thine were so!"
19312,CXXIII,
19313,CXXIV,CXXIV
19314,CXXIV,"Alas, among so many, could not one,"
19315,CXXIV,"Not one draw blood, one wound or rend his skin?"
19316,CXXIV,"All other breasts to you are marble stone,"
19317,CXXIV,Dare you then pierce a woman’s bosom thin?
19318,CXXIV,"See, see, my naked heart, on this alone"
19319,CXXIV,"Employ your force this fort is eath to win,"
19320,CXXIV,"And love will shoot you from his mighty bow,"
19321,CXXIV,Weak is the shot that dripile falls in snow.
19322,CXXIV,
19323,CXXV,CXXV
19324,CXXV,"“I pardon will your fear and weakness past,"
19325,CXXV,"Be strong, mine arrows, cruel, sharp, gainst me,"
19326,CXXV,"Ah, wretch, how is thy chance and fortune cast,"
19327,CXXV,If placed in these thy good and comfort be?
19328,CXXV,"But since all hope is vain all help is waste,"
19329,CXXV,"Since hurts ease hurts, wounds must cure wounds in thee;"
19330,CXXV,"Then with thine arrow’s stroke cure stroke of love,"
19331,CXXV,Death for thy heart must salve and surgeon prove.
19332,CXXV,
19333,CXXVI,CXXVI
19334,CXXVI,"“And happy me if, being dead and slain,"
19335,CXXVI,I bear not with me this strange plague to hell:
19336,CXXVI,"Love, stay behind, come thou with me disdain,"
19337,CXXVI,And with my wronged soul forever dwell;
19338,CXXVI,Or else with it turn to the world again
19339,CXXVI,"And vex that knight with dreams and visions fell,"
19340,CXXVI,"And tell him, when twixt life and death I strove"
19341,CXXVI,"My last wish, was revenge—last word, was love.”"
19342,CXXVI,
19343,CXXVII,CXXVII
19344,CXXVII,"And with that word half mad, half dead, she seems,"
19345,CXXVII,"An arrow, poignant, strong and sharp she took,"
19346,CXXVII,"When her dear knight found her in these extremes,"
19347,CXXVII,"Now fit to die, and pass the Stygian brook,"
19348,CXXVII,Now prest to quench her own and beauty’s beams;
19349,CXXVII,"Now death sat on her eyes, death in her look,"
19350,CXXVII,"When to her back he stepped, and stayed her arm"
19351,CXXVII,"Stretched forth to do that service last, last harm."
19352,CXXVII,
19353,CXXVIII,CXXVIII
19354,CXXVIII,"She turns and, ere she knows, her lord she spies,"
19355,CXXVIII,"Whose coming was unwished, unthought, unknown,"
19356,CXXVIII,"She shrieks, and twines away her  sdainful eyes"
19357,CXXVIII,"From his sweet face, she falls dead in a swoon,"
19358,CXXVIII,"Falls as a flower half cut, that bending lies:"
19359,CXXVIII,"He held her up, and lest she tumble down,"
19360,CXXVIII,"Under her tender side his arm he placed,"
19361,CXXVIII,"His hand her girdle loosed, her gown unlaced;"
19362,CXXVIII,
19363,CXXIX,CXXIX
19364,CXXIX,"And her fair face, fair bosom he bedews"
19365,CXXIX,"With tears, tears of remorse, of ruth, of sorrow."
19366,CXXIX,As the pale rose her color lost renews
19367,CXXIX,"With the fresh drops fallen from the silver morrow,"
19368,CXXIX,"So she revives, and cheeks empurpled shows"
19369,CXXIX,Moist with their own tears and with tears they borrow;
19370,CXXIX,"Thrice looked she up, her eyes thrice closed she;"
19371,CXXIX,"As who say, “Let me die, ere look on thee.”"
19372,CXXIX,
19373,CXXX,CXXX
19374,CXXX,"And his strong arm, with weak and feeble hand"
19375,CXXX,"She would have thrust away, loosed and untwined:"
19376,CXXX,"Oft strove she, but in vain, to break that band,"
19377,CXXX,"For he the hold he got not yet resigned,"
19378,CXXX,"Herself fast bound in those dear knots she fand,"
19379,CXXX,"Dear, though she feigned scorn, strove and repined:"
19380,CXXX,"At last she speaks, she weeps, complains and cries;"
19381,CXXX,"Yet durst not, did not, would not see his eyes."
19382,CXXX,
19383,CXXXI,CXXXI
19384,CXXXI,"“Cruel at thy departure, at return"
19385,CXXXI,"As cruel, say, what chance thee hither guideth,"
19386,CXXXI,Would’st thou prevent her death whose heart forlorn
19387,CXXXI,"For thee, for thee death’s strokes each hour divideth?"
19388,CXXXI,"Com’st thou to save my life?  alas, what scorn,"
19389,CXXXI,What torment for Armida poor abideth?
19390,CXXXI,"No, no, thy crafts and sleights I well descry,"
19391,CXXXI,But she can little do that cannot die.

19416,CXXXIV,"From his pure fountains ran two streams likewise,"
19417,CXXXIV,Wherein chaste pity and mild ruth appears:

19419,CXXXIV,"“Madam, appease your grief, your wrath, your fears,"
19420,CXXXIV,"For to be crowned, not scorned, your life I save;"

19427,CXXXV,"I will restore thee, crown thee with that gold,"
19428,CXXXV,And if high Heaven would so much grace afford
19429,CXXXV,As from thy heart this cloud this veil unfold
19430,CXXXV,"Of Paganism, in all the east no dame"

19438,CXXXVI,So melts her wrath; but love remains entire.
19439,CXXXVI,"“Behold,” she says, “your handmaid and your thrall:"
