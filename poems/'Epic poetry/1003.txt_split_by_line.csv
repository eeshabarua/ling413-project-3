54,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto I
55,APPENDIX,
56,APPENDIX,
57,APPENDIX,The glory of Him who moveth everything
58,APPENDIX,"Doth penetrate the universe, and shine"
59,APPENDIX,In one part more and in another less.
60,APPENDIX,
61,APPENDIX,Within that heaven which most his light receives
62,APPENDIX,"Was I, and things beheld which to repeat"
63,APPENDIX,"Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;"
64,APPENDIX,
65,APPENDIX,Because in drawing near to its desire
66,APPENDIX,"Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,"
67,APPENDIX,That after it the memory cannot go.
68,APPENDIX,
69,APPENDIX,Truly whatever of the holy realm
70,APPENDIX,I had the power to treasure in my mind
71,APPENDIX,Shall now become the subject of my song.
72,APPENDIX,
73,APPENDIX,"O good Apollo, for this last emprise"
74,APPENDIX,Make of me such a vessel of thy power
75,APPENDIX,As giving the beloved laurel asks!
76,APPENDIX,
77,APPENDIX,One summit of Parnassus hitherto
78,APPENDIX,"Has been enough for me, but now with both"
79,APPENDIX,I needs must enter the arena left.
80,APPENDIX,
81,APPENDIX,"Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe"
82,APPENDIX,As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw
83,APPENDIX,Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.
84,APPENDIX,
85,APPENDIX,"O power divine, lend’st thou thyself to me"
86,APPENDIX,So that the shadow of the blessed realm
87,APPENDIX,"Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,"
88,APPENDIX,
89,APPENDIX,"Thou’lt see me come unto thy darling tree,"
90,APPENDIX,And crown myself thereafter with those leaves
91,APPENDIX,Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.
92,APPENDIX,
93,APPENDIX,"So seldom, Father, do we gather them"
94,APPENDIX,"For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,"
95,APPENDIX,"(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)"
96,APPENDIX,
97,APPENDIX,That the Peneian foliage should bring forth
98,APPENDIX,"Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,"
99,APPENDIX,When any one it makes to thirst for it.
100,APPENDIX,
101,APPENDIX,A little spark is followed by great flame;
102,APPENDIX,Perchance with better voices after me
103,APPENDIX,Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!
104,APPENDIX,
105,APPENDIX,To mortal men by passages diverse
106,APPENDIX,Uprises the world’s lamp; but by that one
107,APPENDIX,"Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,"
108,APPENDIX,
109,APPENDIX,With better course and with a better star
110,APPENDIX,"Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax"
111,APPENDIX,Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.
112,APPENDIX,
113,APPENDIX,Almost that passage had made morning there
114,APPENDIX,"And evening here, and there was wholly white"
115,APPENDIX,"That hemisphere, and black the other part,"
116,APPENDIX,
117,APPENDIX,When Beatrice towards the left-hand side
118,APPENDIX,"I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;"
119,APPENDIX,Never did eagle fasten so upon it!
120,APPENDIX,
121,APPENDIX,And even as a second ray is wont
122,APPENDIX,"To issue from the first and reascend,"
123,APPENDIX,"Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,"
124,APPENDIX,
125,APPENDIX,"Thus of her action, through the eyes infused"
126,APPENDIX,"In my imagination, mine I made,"
127,APPENDIX,And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.
128,APPENDIX,
129,APPENDIX,There much is lawful which is here unlawful
130,APPENDIX,"Unto our powers, by virtue of the place"
131,APPENDIX,Made for the human species as its own.
132,APPENDIX,
133,APPENDIX,"Not long I bore it, nor so little while"
134,APPENDIX,But I beheld it sparkle round about
135,APPENDIX,Like iron that comes molten from the fire;
136,APPENDIX,
137,APPENDIX,And suddenly it seemed that day to day
138,APPENDIX,"Was added, as if He who has the power"
139,APPENDIX,Had with another sun the heaven adorned.
140,APPENDIX,
141,APPENDIX,With eyes upon the everlasting wheels
142,APPENDIX,"Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her"
143,APPENDIX,"Fixing my vision from above removed,"
144,APPENDIX,
145,APPENDIX,Such at her aspect inwardly became
146,APPENDIX,"As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him"
147,APPENDIX,Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.
148,APPENDIX,
149,APPENDIX,To represent transhumanise in words
150,APPENDIX,"Impossible were; the example, then, suffice"
151,APPENDIX,Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.
152,APPENDIX,
153,APPENDIX,If I was merely what of me thou newly
154,APPENDIX,"Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,"
155,APPENDIX,"Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!"
156,APPENDIX,
157,APPENDIX,"When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal"
158,APPENDIX,"Desiring thee, made me attentive to it"
159,APPENDIX,"By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,"
160,APPENDIX,
161,APPENDIX,Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled
162,APPENDIX,"By the sun’s flame, that neither rain nor river"
163,APPENDIX,E’er made a lake so widely spread abroad.
164,APPENDIX,
165,APPENDIX,The newness of the sound and the great light
166,APPENDIX,"Kindled in me a longing for their cause,"
167,APPENDIX,Never before with such acuteness felt;
168,APPENDIX,
169,APPENDIX,"Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,"
170,APPENDIX,"To quiet in me my perturbed mind,"
171,APPENDIX,"Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,"
172,APPENDIX,
173,APPENDIX,And she began: “Thou makest thyself so dull
174,APPENDIX,"With false imagining, that thou seest not"
175,APPENDIX,What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.
176,APPENDIX,
177,APPENDIX,"Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;"
178,APPENDIX,"But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,"
179,APPENDIX,"Ne’er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.”"
180,APPENDIX,
181,APPENDIX,If of my former doubt I was divested
182,APPENDIX,"By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,"
183,APPENDIX,I in a new one was the more ensnared;
184,APPENDIX,
185,APPENDIX,And said: “Already did I rest content
186,APPENDIX,From great amazement; but am now amazed
187,APPENDIX,In what way I transcend these bodies light.”
188,APPENDIX,
189,APPENDIX,"Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,"
190,APPENDIX,Her eyes directed tow’rds me with that look
191,APPENDIX,A mother casts on a delirious child;
192,APPENDIX,
193,APPENDIX,And she began: “All things whate’er they be
194,APPENDIX,"Have order among themselves, and this is form,"
195,APPENDIX,That makes the universe resemble God.
196,APPENDIX,
197,APPENDIX,Here do the higher creatures see the footprints
198,APPENDIX,"Of the Eternal Power, which is the end"
199,APPENDIX,Whereto is made the law already mentioned.
200,APPENDIX,
201,APPENDIX,In the order that I speak of are inclined
202,APPENDIX,"All natures, by their destinies diverse,"
203,APPENDIX,More or less near unto their origin;
204,APPENDIX,
205,APPENDIX,Hence they move onward unto ports diverse
206,APPENDIX,O’er the great sea of being; and each one
207,APPENDIX,With instinct given it which bears it on.
208,APPENDIX,
209,APPENDIX,This bears away the fire towards the moon;
210,APPENDIX,This is in mortal hearts the motive power
211,APPENDIX,This binds together and unites the earth.
212,APPENDIX,
213,APPENDIX,Nor only the created things that are
214,APPENDIX,"Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,"
215,APPENDIX,But those that have both intellect and love.
216,APPENDIX,
217,APPENDIX,The Providence that regulates all this
218,APPENDIX,"Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,"
219,APPENDIX,Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.
220,APPENDIX,
221,APPENDIX,"And thither now, as to a site decreed,"
222,APPENDIX,Bears us away the virtue of that cord
223,APPENDIX,Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.
224,APPENDIX,
225,APPENDIX,"True is it, that as oftentimes the form"
226,APPENDIX,"Accords not with the intention of the art,"
227,APPENDIX,"Because in answering is matter deaf,"
228,APPENDIX,
229,APPENDIX,So likewise from this course doth deviate
230,APPENDIX,"Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,"
231,APPENDIX,"Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,"
232,APPENDIX,
233,APPENDIX,(In the same wise as one may see the fire
234,APPENDIX,"Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus"
235,APPENDIX,Earthward is wrested by some false delight.
236,APPENDIX,
237,APPENDIX,"Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,"
238,APPENDIX,"At thine ascent, than at a rivulet"
239,APPENDIX,From some high mount descending to the lowland.
240,APPENDIX,
241,APPENDIX,"Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived"
242,APPENDIX,"Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,"
243,APPENDIX,As if on earth the living fire were quiet.”
244,APPENDIX,
245,APPENDIX,Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.
246,APPENDIX,

249,APPENDIX,
250,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto II
251,APPENDIX,
252,APPENDIX,
253,APPENDIX,"O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,"
254,APPENDIX,"Eager to listen, have been following"
255,APPENDIX,"Behind my ship, that singing sails along,"
256,APPENDIX,
257,APPENDIX,Turn back to look again upon your shores;
258,APPENDIX,"Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,"
259,APPENDIX,"In losing me, you might yourselves be lost."
260,APPENDIX,
261,APPENDIX,The sea I sail has never yet been passed;
262,APPENDIX,"Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,"
263,APPENDIX,And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.
264,APPENDIX,
265,APPENDIX,Ye other few who have the neck uplifted
266,APPENDIX,Betimes to th’ bread of Angels upon which
267,APPENDIX,"One liveth here and grows not sated by it,"
268,APPENDIX,
269,APPENDIX,Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea
270,APPENDIX,"Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you"
271,APPENDIX,Upon the water that grows smooth again.
272,APPENDIX,
273,APPENDIX,Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed
274,APPENDIX,"Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,"
275,APPENDIX,When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!
276,APPENDIX,
277,APPENDIX,The con-created and perpetual thirst
278,APPENDIX,"For the realm deiform did bear us on,"
279,APPENDIX,As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.
280,APPENDIX,
281,APPENDIX,"Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;"
282,APPENDIX,And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt
283,APPENDIX,"And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,"
284,APPENDIX,
285,APPENDIX,Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing
286,APPENDIX,Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she
287,APPENDIX,"From whom no care of mine could be concealed,"
288,APPENDIX,
289,APPENDIX,"Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,"
290,APPENDIX,Said unto me: “Fix gratefully thy mind
291,APPENDIX,"On God, who unto the first star has brought us.”"
292,APPENDIX,
293,APPENDIX,"It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,"
294,APPENDIX,"Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright"
295,APPENDIX,As adamant on which the sun is striking.
296,APPENDIX,
297,APPENDIX,Into itself did the eternal pearl
298,APPENDIX,"Receive us, even as water doth receive"
299,APPENDIX,"A ray of light, remaining still unbroken."
300,APPENDIX,
301,APPENDIX,"If I was body, (and we here conceive not"
302,APPENDIX,"How one dimension tolerates another,"
303,APPENDIX,"Which needs must be if body enter body,)"
304,APPENDIX,
305,APPENDIX,More the desire should be enkindled in us
306,APPENDIX,"That essence to behold, wherein is seen"
307,APPENDIX,How God and our own nature were united.
308,APPENDIX,
309,APPENDIX,"There will be seen what we receive by faith,"
310,APPENDIX,"Not demonstrated, but self-evident"
311,APPENDIX,In guise of the first truth that man believes.
312,APPENDIX,
313,APPENDIX,"I made reply: “Madonna, as devoutly"
314,APPENDIX,As most I can do I give thanks to Him
315,APPENDIX,Who has removed me from the mortal world.
316,APPENDIX,
317,APPENDIX,But tell me what the dusky spots may be
318,APPENDIX,"Upon this body, which below on earth"
319,APPENDIX,Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?”
320,APPENDIX,
321,APPENDIX,"Somewhat she smiled; and then, “If the opinion"
322,APPENDIX,"Of mortals be erroneous,” she said,"
323,APPENDIX,"“Where’er the key of sense doth not unlock,"
324,APPENDIX,
325,APPENDIX,"Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee"
326,APPENDIX,"Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,"
327,APPENDIX,Thou seest that the reason has short wings.
328,APPENDIX,
329,APPENDIX,But tell me what thou think’st of it thyself.”
330,APPENDIX,"And I: “What seems to us up here diverse,"
331,APPENDIX,"Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.”"
332,APPENDIX,
333,APPENDIX,And she: “Right truly shalt thou see immersed
334,APPENDIX,"In error thy belief, if well thou hearest"
335,APPENDIX,The argument that I shall make against it.
336,APPENDIX,
337,APPENDIX,Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you
338,APPENDIX,Which in their quality and quantity
339,APPENDIX,May noted be of aspects different.
340,APPENDIX,
341,APPENDIX,"If this were caused by rare and dense alone,"
342,APPENDIX,One only virtue would there be in all
343,APPENDIX,"Or more or less diffused, or equally."
344,APPENDIX,
345,APPENDIX,Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits
346,APPENDIX,"Of formal principles; and these, save one,"
347,APPENDIX,Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.
348,APPENDIX,
349,APPENDIX,"Besides, if rarity were of this dimness"
350,APPENDIX,"The cause thou askest, either through and through"
351,APPENDIX,"This planet thus attenuate were of matter,"
352,APPENDIX,
353,APPENDIX,"Or else, as in a body is apportioned"
354,APPENDIX,"The fat and lean, so in like manner this"
355,APPENDIX,Would in its volume interchange the leaves.
356,APPENDIX,
357,APPENDIX,"Were it the former, in the sun’s eclipse"
358,APPENDIX,It would be manifest by the shining through
359,APPENDIX,"Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused."
360,APPENDIX,
361,APPENDIX,"This is not so; hence we must scan the other,"
362,APPENDIX,"And if it chance the other I demolish,"
363,APPENDIX,Then falsified will thy opinion be.
364,APPENDIX,
365,APPENDIX,"But if this rarity go not through and through,"
366,APPENDIX,"There needs must be a limit, beyond which"
367,APPENDIX,"Its contrary prevents the further passing,"
368,APPENDIX,
369,APPENDIX,"And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,"
370,APPENDIX,"Even as a colour cometh back from glass,"
371,APPENDIX,The which behind itself concealeth lead.
372,APPENDIX,
373,APPENDIX,Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself
374,APPENDIX,"More dimly there than in the other parts,"
375,APPENDIX,By being there reflected farther back.
376,APPENDIX,
377,APPENDIX,From this reply experiment will free thee
378,APPENDIX,"If e’er thou try it, which is wont to be"
379,APPENDIX,The fountain to the rivers of your arts.
380,APPENDIX,
381,APPENDIX,"Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove"
382,APPENDIX,"Alike from thee, the other more remote"
383,APPENDIX,Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.
384,APPENDIX,
385,APPENDIX,"Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back"
386,APPENDIX,"Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors"
387,APPENDIX,And coming back to thee by all reflected.
388,APPENDIX,
389,APPENDIX,Though in its quantity be not so ample
390,APPENDIX,"The image most remote, there shalt thou see"
391,APPENDIX,How it perforce is equally resplendent.
392,APPENDIX,
393,APPENDIX,"Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays"
394,APPENDIX,Naked the subject of the snow remains
395,APPENDIX,"Both of its former colour and its cold,"
396,APPENDIX,
397,APPENDIX,"Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,"
398,APPENDIX,"Will I inform with such a living light,"
399,APPENDIX,That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.
400,APPENDIX,
401,APPENDIX,Within the heaven of the divine repose
402,APPENDIX,"Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies"
403,APPENDIX,The being of whatever it contains.
404,APPENDIX,
405,APPENDIX,"The following heaven, that has so many eyes,"
406,APPENDIX,"Divides this being by essences diverse,"
407,APPENDIX,"Distinguished from it, and by it contained."
408,APPENDIX,
409,APPENDIX,"The other spheres, by various differences,"
410,APPENDIX,All the distinctions which they have within them
411,APPENDIX,Dispose unto their ends and their effects.
412,APPENDIX,
413,APPENDIX,"Thus do these organs of the world proceed,"
414,APPENDIX,"As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;"
415,APPENDIX,"Since from above they take, and act beneath."
416,APPENDIX,
417,APPENDIX,"Observe me well, how through this place I come"
418,APPENDIX,"Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter"
419,APPENDIX,Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford
420,APPENDIX,
421,APPENDIX,"The power and motion of the holy spheres,"
422,APPENDIX,"As from the artisan the hammer’s craft,"
423,APPENDIX,Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.
424,APPENDIX,
425,APPENDIX,"The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,"
426,APPENDIX,"From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,"
427,APPENDIX,"The image takes, and makes of it a seal."
428,APPENDIX,
429,APPENDIX,And even as the soul within your dust
430,APPENDIX,Through members different and accommodated
431,APPENDIX,"To faculties diverse expands itself,"
432,APPENDIX,
433,APPENDIX,So likewise this Intelligence diffuses
434,APPENDIX,Its virtue multiplied among the stars.
435,APPENDIX,Itself revolving on its unity.
436,APPENDIX,
437,APPENDIX,Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage
438,APPENDIX,"Make with the precious body that it quickens,"
439,APPENDIX,"In which, as life in you, it is combined."
440,APPENDIX,
441,APPENDIX,"From the glad nature whence it is derived,"
442,APPENDIX,"The mingled virtue through the body shines,"
443,APPENDIX,Even as gladness through the living pupil.
444,APPENDIX,
445,APPENDIX,From this proceeds whate’er from light to light
446,APPENDIX,"Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:"
447,APPENDIX,"This is the formal principle that produces,"
448,APPENDIX,
449,APPENDIX,"According to its goodness, dark and bright.”"
450,APPENDIX,

453,APPENDIX,
454,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto III
455,APPENDIX,
456,APPENDIX,
457,APPENDIX,"That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,"
458,APPENDIX,"Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,"
459,APPENDIX,"By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect."
460,APPENDIX,
461,APPENDIX,"And, that I might confess myself convinced"
462,APPENDIX,"And confident, so far as was befitting,"
463,APPENDIX,I lifted more erect my head to speak.
464,APPENDIX,
465,APPENDIX,"But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me"
466,APPENDIX,"So close to it, in order to be seen,"
467,APPENDIX,That my confession I remembered not.
468,APPENDIX,
469,APPENDIX,"Such as through polished and transparent glass,"
470,APPENDIX,"Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,"
471,APPENDIX,"But not so deep as that their bed be lost,"
472,APPENDIX,
473,APPENDIX,Come back again the outlines of our faces
474,APPENDIX,"So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white"
475,APPENDIX,Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;
476,APPENDIX,
477,APPENDIX,"Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,"
478,APPENDIX,So that I ran in error opposite
479,APPENDIX,To that which kindled love ’twixt man and fountain.
480,APPENDIX,
481,APPENDIX,"As soon as I became aware of them,"
482,APPENDIX,"Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,"
483,APPENDIX,"To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,"
484,APPENDIX,
485,APPENDIX,"And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward"
486,APPENDIX,"Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,"
487,APPENDIX,Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.
488,APPENDIX,
489,APPENDIX,"“Marvel thou not,” she said to me, “because"
490,APPENDIX,"I smile at this thy puerile conceit,"
491,APPENDIX,"Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,"
492,APPENDIX,
493,APPENDIX,"But turns thee, as ’tis wont, on emptiness."
494,APPENDIX,"True substances are these which thou beholdest,"
495,APPENDIX,Here relegate for breaking of some vow.
496,APPENDIX,
497,APPENDIX,"Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;"
498,APPENDIX,"For the true light, which giveth peace to them,"
499,APPENDIX,Permits them not to turn from it their feet.”
500,APPENDIX,
501,APPENDIX,And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful
502,APPENDIX,"To speak directed me, and I began,"
503,APPENDIX,As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:
504,APPENDIX,
505,APPENDIX,"“O well-created spirit, who in the rays"
506,APPENDIX,Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste
507,APPENDIX,"Which being untasted ne’er is comprehended,"
508,APPENDIX,
509,APPENDIX,"Grateful ’twill be to me, if thou content me"
510,APPENDIX,Both with thy name and with your destiny.”
511,APPENDIX,Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:
512,APPENDIX,
513,APPENDIX,“Our charity doth never shut the doors
514,APPENDIX,"Against a just desire, except as one"
515,APPENDIX,Who wills that all her court be like herself.
516,APPENDIX,
517,APPENDIX,I was a virgin sister in the world;
518,APPENDIX,"And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,"
519,APPENDIX,"The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,"
520,APPENDIX,
521,APPENDIX,"But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,"
522,APPENDIX,"Who, stationed here among these other blessed,"
523,APPENDIX,Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.
524,APPENDIX,
525,APPENDIX,"All our affections, that alone inflamed"
526,APPENDIX,"Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,"
527,APPENDIX,Rejoice at being of his order formed;
528,APPENDIX,
529,APPENDIX,"And this allotment, which appears so low,"
530,APPENDIX,"Therefore is given us, because our vows"
531,APPENDIX,Have been neglected and in some part void.”
532,APPENDIX,
533,APPENDIX,Whence I to her: “In your miraculous aspects
534,APPENDIX,"There shines I know not what of the divine,"
535,APPENDIX,Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.
536,APPENDIX,
537,APPENDIX,Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;
538,APPENDIX,"But what thou tellest me now aids me so,"
539,APPENDIX,That the refiguring is easier to me.
540,APPENDIX,
541,APPENDIX,"But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,"
542,APPENDIX,"Are you desirous of a higher place,"
543,APPENDIX,To see more or to make yourselves more friends?”
544,APPENDIX,
545,APPENDIX,First with those other shades she smiled a little;
546,APPENDIX,"Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,"
547,APPENDIX,She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:
548,APPENDIX,
549,APPENDIX,"“Brother, our will is quieted by virtue"
550,APPENDIX,"Of charity, that makes us wish alone"
551,APPENDIX,"For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more."
552,APPENDIX,
553,APPENDIX,"If to be more exalted we aspired,"
554,APPENDIX,Discordant would our aspirations be
555,APPENDIX,Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;
556,APPENDIX,
557,APPENDIX,"Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,"
558,APPENDIX,"If being in charity is needful here,"
559,APPENDIX,And if thou lookest well into its nature;
560,APPENDIX,
561,APPENDIX,"Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence"
562,APPENDIX,"To keep itself within the will divine,"
563,APPENDIX,Whereby our very wishes are made one;
564,APPENDIX,
565,APPENDIX,"So that, as we are station above station"
566,APPENDIX,"Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,"
567,APPENDIX,"As to the King, who makes his will our will."
568,APPENDIX,
569,APPENDIX,And his will is our peace; this is the sea
570,APPENDIX,To which is moving onward whatsoever
571,APPENDIX,"It doth create, and all that nature makes.”"
572,APPENDIX,
573,APPENDIX,Then it was clear to me how everywhere
574,APPENDIX,"In heaven is Paradise, although the grace"
575,APPENDIX,Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.
576,APPENDIX,
577,APPENDIX,"But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,"
578,APPENDIX,"And for another still remains the longing,"
579,APPENDIX,"We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,"
580,APPENDIX,
581,APPENDIX,"E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,"
582,APPENDIX,To learn from her what was the web wherein
583,APPENDIX,She did not ply the shuttle to the end.
584,APPENDIX,
585,APPENDIX,“A perfect life and merit high in-heaven
586,APPENDIX,"A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule"
587,APPENDIX,"Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,"
588,APPENDIX,
589,APPENDIX,That until death they may both watch and sleep
590,APPENDIX,Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts
591,APPENDIX,Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.
592,APPENDIX,
593,APPENDIX,"To follow her, in girlhood from the world"
594,APPENDIX,"I fled, and in her habit shut myself,"
595,APPENDIX,And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.
596,APPENDIX,
597,APPENDIX,Then men accustomed unto evil more
598,APPENDIX,"Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;"
599,APPENDIX,God knows what afterward my life became.
600,APPENDIX,
601,APPENDIX,"This other splendour, which to thee reveals"
602,APPENDIX,"Itself on my right side, and is enkindled"
603,APPENDIX,"With all the illumination of our sphere,"
604,APPENDIX,
605,APPENDIX,What of myself I say applies to her;
606,APPENDIX,"A nun was she, and likewise from her head"
607,APPENDIX,Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.
608,APPENDIX,
609,APPENDIX,But when she too was to the world returned
610,APPENDIX,"Against her wishes and against good usage,"
611,APPENDIX,Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.
612,APPENDIX,
613,APPENDIX,"Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,"
614,APPENDIX,Who from the second wind of Suabia
615,APPENDIX,Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”
616,APPENDIX,
617,APPENDIX,"Thus unto me she spake, and then began"
618,APPENDIX,"“Ave Maria” singing, and in singing"
619,APPENDIX,"Vanished, as through deep water something heavy."
620,APPENDIX,
621,APPENDIX,"My sight, that followed her as long a time"
622,APPENDIX,"As it was possible, when it had lost her"
623,APPENDIX,"Turned round unto the mark of more desire,"
624,APPENDIX,
625,APPENDIX,And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;
626,APPENDIX,"But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,"
627,APPENDIX,That at the first my sight endured it not;
628,APPENDIX,
629,APPENDIX,And this in questioning more backward made me.
630,APPENDIX,
631,APPENDIX,

634,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto IV
635,APPENDIX,
636,APPENDIX,
637,APPENDIX,"Between two viands, equally removed"
638,APPENDIX,"And tempting, a free man would die of hunger"
639,APPENDIX,Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.
640,APPENDIX,
641,APPENDIX,So would a lamb between the ravenings
642,APPENDIX,Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;
643,APPENDIX,And so would stand a dog between two does.
644,APPENDIX,
645,APPENDIX,"Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,"
646,APPENDIX,"Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,"
647,APPENDIX,"Since it must be so, nor do I commend."
648,APPENDIX,
649,APPENDIX,I held my peace; but my desire was painted
650,APPENDIX,"Upon my face, and questioning with that"
651,APPENDIX,More fervent far than by articulate speech.
652,APPENDIX,
653,APPENDIX,Beatrice did as Daniel had done
654,APPENDIX,Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath
655,APPENDIX,"Which rendered him unjustly merciless,"
656,APPENDIX,
657,APPENDIX,And said: “Well see I how attracteth thee
658,APPENDIX,"One and the other wish, so that thy care"
659,APPENDIX,Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.
660,APPENDIX,
661,APPENDIX,"Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,"
662,APPENDIX,"The violence of others, for what reason"
663,APPENDIX,Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?
664,APPENDIX,
665,APPENDIX,Again for doubting furnish thee occasion
666,APPENDIX,"Souls seeming to return unto the stars,"
667,APPENDIX,According to the sentiment of Plato.
668,APPENDIX,
669,APPENDIX,These are the questions which upon thy wish
670,APPENDIX,Are thrusting equally; and therefore first
671,APPENDIX,Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.

677,APPENDIX,"Have not in any other heaven their seats,"
678,APPENDIX,"Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,"
679,APPENDIX,Nor of existence more or fewer years;
680,APPENDIX,
681,APPENDIX,"But all make beautiful the primal circle,"
682,APPENDIX,"And have sweet life in different degrees,"
683,APPENDIX,By feeling more or less the eternal breath.
684,APPENDIX,
685,APPENDIX,"They showed themselves here, not because allotted"
686,APPENDIX,"This sphere has been to them, but to give sign"
687,APPENDIX,Of the celestial which is least exalted.
688,APPENDIX,
689,APPENDIX,"To speak thus is adapted to your mind,"
690,APPENDIX,Since only through the sense it apprehendeth
691,APPENDIX,What then it worthy makes of intellect.
692,APPENDIX,
693,APPENDIX,On this account the Scripture condescends
694,APPENDIX,"Unto your faculties, and feet and hands"
695,APPENDIX,"To God attributes, and means something else;"
696,APPENDIX,
697,APPENDIX,And Holy Church under an aspect human
698,APPENDIX,"Gabriel and Michael represent to you,"
699,APPENDIX,And him who made Tobias whole again.
700,APPENDIX,
701,APPENDIX,That which Timaeus argues of the soul
702,APPENDIX,"Doth not resemble that which here is seen,"
703,APPENDIX,Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.
704,APPENDIX,
705,APPENDIX,"He says the soul unto its star returns,"
706,APPENDIX,Believing it to have been severed thence
707,APPENDIX,Whenever nature gave it as a form.
708,APPENDIX,
709,APPENDIX,Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise
710,APPENDIX,"Than the words sound, and possibly may be"
711,APPENDIX,With meaning that is not to be derided.
712,APPENDIX,
713,APPENDIX,If he doth mean that to these wheels return
714,APPENDIX,"The honour of their influence and the blame,"
715,APPENDIX,Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.
716,APPENDIX,
717,APPENDIX,This principle ill understood once warped
718,APPENDIX,"The whole world nearly, till it went astray"
719,APPENDIX,Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.
720,APPENDIX,
721,APPENDIX,The other doubt which doth disquiet thee
722,APPENDIX,"Less venom has, for its malevolence"
723,APPENDIX,Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.
724,APPENDIX,
725,APPENDIX,That as unjust our justice should appear
726,APPENDIX,"In eyes of mortals, is an argument"
727,APPENDIX,"Of faith, and not of sin heretical."
728,APPENDIX,
729,APPENDIX,"But still, that your perception may be able"
730,APPENDIX,"To thoroughly penetrate this verity,"
731,APPENDIX,"As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee."
732,APPENDIX,
733,APPENDIX,If it be violence when he who suffers
734,APPENDIX,"Co-operates not with him who uses force,"
735,APPENDIX,These souls were not on that account excused;
736,APPENDIX,
737,APPENDIX,"For will is never quenched unless it will,"
738,APPENDIX,But operates as nature doth in fire
739,APPENDIX,If violence a thousand times distort it.
740,APPENDIX,
741,APPENDIX,"Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds"
742,APPENDIX,"The force; and these have done so, having power"
743,APPENDIX,Of turning back unto the holy place.
744,APPENDIX,
745,APPENDIX,"If their will had been perfect, like to that"
746,APPENDIX,"Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,"
747,APPENDIX,"And Mutius made severe to his own hand,"
748,APPENDIX,
749,APPENDIX,It would have urged them back along the road
750,APPENDIX,"Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;"
751,APPENDIX,But such a solid will is all too rare.
752,APPENDIX,
753,APPENDIX,"And by these words, if thou hast gathered them"
754,APPENDIX,"As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted"
755,APPENDIX,That would have still annoyed thee many times.
756,APPENDIX,
757,APPENDIX,But now another passage runs across
758,APPENDIX,"Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself"
759,APPENDIX,Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.
760,APPENDIX,
761,APPENDIX,I have for certain put into thy mind
762,APPENDIX,"That soul beatified could never lie,"
763,APPENDIX,"For it is near the primal Truth,"
764,APPENDIX,
765,APPENDIX,And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard
766,APPENDIX,"Costanza kept affection for the veil,"
767,APPENDIX,So that she seemeth here to contradict me.
768,APPENDIX,
769,APPENDIX,"Many times, brother, has it come to pass,"
770,APPENDIX,"That, to escape from peril, with reluctance"
771,APPENDIX,"That has been done it was not right to do,"
772,APPENDIX,
773,APPENDIX,"E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father"
774,APPENDIX,"Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)"
775,APPENDIX,Not to lose pity pitiless became.
776,APPENDIX,
777,APPENDIX,At this point I desire thee to remember
778,APPENDIX,"That force with will commingles, and they cause"
779,APPENDIX,That the offences cannot be excused.
780,APPENDIX,
781,APPENDIX,Will absolute consenteth not to evil;
782,APPENDIX,"But in so far consenteth as it fears,"
783,APPENDIX,"If it refrain, to fall into more harm."
784,APPENDIX,
785,APPENDIX,"Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,"
786,APPENDIX,"She meaneth the will absolute, and I"
787,APPENDIX,"The other, so that both of us speak truth.”"
788,APPENDIX,
789,APPENDIX,Such was the flowing of the holy river
790,APPENDIX,That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;
791,APPENDIX,This put to rest my wishes one and all.
792,APPENDIX,
793,APPENDIX,"“O love of the first lover, O divine,”"
794,APPENDIX,"Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me"
795,APPENDIX,"And warms me so, it more and more revives me,"
796,APPENDIX,
797,APPENDIX,My own affection is not so profound
798,APPENDIX,As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;
799,APPENDIX,"Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond."
800,APPENDIX,
801,APPENDIX,Well I perceive that never sated is
802,APPENDIX,"Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,"
803,APPENDIX,Beyond which nothing true expands itself.
804,APPENDIX,
805,APPENDIX,"It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,"
806,APPENDIX,When it attains it; and it can attain it;
807,APPENDIX,"If not, then each desire would frustrate be."
808,APPENDIX,
809,APPENDIX,"Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,"
810,APPENDIX,"Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,"
811,APPENDIX,Which to the top from height to height impels us.
812,APPENDIX,
813,APPENDIX,"This doth invite me, this assurance give me"
814,APPENDIX,"With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you"
815,APPENDIX,"Another truth, which is obscure to me."
816,APPENDIX,
817,APPENDIX,I wish to know if man can satisfy you
818,APPENDIX,"For broken vows with other good deeds, so"
819,APPENDIX,That in your balance they will not be light.”
820,APPENDIX,
821,APPENDIX,Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes
822,APPENDIX,"Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,"
823,APPENDIX,"That, overcome my power, I turned my back"
824,APPENDIX,
825,APPENDIX,And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.
826,APPENDIX,
827,APPENDIX,
828,APPENDIX,
829,APPENDIX,
830,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto V
831,APPENDIX,
832,APPENDIX,
833,APPENDIX,“If in the heat of love I flame upon thee
834,APPENDIX,"Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,"
835,APPENDIX,"So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,"
836,APPENDIX,
837,APPENDIX,Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds
838,APPENDIX,"From perfect sight, which as it apprehends"
839,APPENDIX,To the good apprehended moves its feet.
840,APPENDIX,
841,APPENDIX,Well I perceive how is already shining
842,APPENDIX,"Into thine intellect the eternal light,"
843,APPENDIX,That only seen enkindles always love;
844,APPENDIX,
845,APPENDIX,"And if some other thing your love seduce,"
846,APPENDIX,"’Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,"
847,APPENDIX,"Ill understood, which there is shining through."
848,APPENDIX,
849,APPENDIX,Thou fain wouldst know if with another service
850,APPENDIX,For broken vow can such return be made
851,APPENDIX,As to secure the soul from further claim.”
852,APPENDIX,
853,APPENDIX,This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;
854,APPENDIX,"And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,"
855,APPENDIX,Continued thus her holy argument:
856,APPENDIX,
857,APPENDIX,“The greatest gift that in his largess God
858,APPENDIX,"Creating made, and unto his own goodness"
859,APPENDIX,"Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize"
860,APPENDIX,
861,APPENDIX,"Most highly, is the freedom of the will,"
862,APPENDIX,Wherewith the creatures of intelligence
863,APPENDIX,Both all and only were and are endowed.
864,APPENDIX,
865,APPENDIX,"Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,"
866,APPENDIX,"The high worth of a vow, if it he made"
867,APPENDIX,So that when thou consentest God consents:
868,APPENDIX,
869,APPENDIX,"For, closing between God and man the compact,"
870,APPENDIX,"A sacrifice is of this treasure made,"
871,APPENDIX,"Such as I say, and made by its own act."
872,APPENDIX,
873,APPENDIX,What can be rendered then as compensation?
874,APPENDIX,"Think’st thou to make good use of what thou’st offered,"
875,APPENDIX,With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.
876,APPENDIX,
877,APPENDIX,Now art thou certain of the greater point;
878,APPENDIX,"But because Holy Church in this dispenses,"
879,APPENDIX,"Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,"
880,APPENDIX,
881,APPENDIX,"Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,"
882,APPENDIX,Because the solid food which thou hast taken
883,APPENDIX,Requireth further aid for thy digestion.
884,APPENDIX,
885,APPENDIX,"Open thy mind to that which I reveal,"
886,APPENDIX,"And fix it there within; for ’tis not knowledge,"
887,APPENDIX,The having heard without retaining it.
888,APPENDIX,
889,APPENDIX,In the essence of this sacrifice two things
890,APPENDIX,Convene together; and the one is that
891,APPENDIX,"Of which ’tis made, the other is the agreement."
892,APPENDIX,
893,APPENDIX,This last for evermore is cancelled not
894,APPENDIX,"Unless complied with, and concerning this"
895,APPENDIX,With such precision has above been spoken.
896,APPENDIX,
897,APPENDIX,Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews
898,APPENDIX,"To offer still, though sometimes what was offered"
899,APPENDIX,"Might be commuted, as thou ought’st to know."
900,APPENDIX,
901,APPENDIX,"The other, which is known to thee as matter,"
902,APPENDIX,May well indeed be such that one errs not
903,APPENDIX,If it for other matter be exchanged.
904,APPENDIX,
905,APPENDIX,But let none shift the burden on his shoulder
906,APPENDIX,"At his arbitrament, without the turning"
907,APPENDIX,Both of the white and of the yellow key;
908,APPENDIX,
909,APPENDIX,"And every permutation deem as foolish,"
910,APPENDIX,"If in the substitute the thing relinquished,"
911,APPENDIX,"As the four is in six, be not contained."
912,APPENDIX,
913,APPENDIX,Therefore whatever thing has so great weight
914,APPENDIX,"In value that it drags down every balance,"
915,APPENDIX,Cannot be satisfied with other spending.
916,APPENDIX,
917,APPENDIX,Let mortals never take a vow in jest;
918,APPENDIX,"Be faithful and not blind in doing that,"
919,APPENDIX,"As Jephthah was in his first offering,"
920,APPENDIX,
921,APPENDIX,"Whom more beseemed to say, ‘I have done wrong,"
922,APPENDIX,Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish
923,APPENDIX,"Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,"
924,APPENDIX,
925,APPENDIX,"Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,"
926,APPENDIX,"And made for her both wise and simple weep,"
927,APPENDIX,Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.’
928,APPENDIX,
929,APPENDIX,"Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;"
930,APPENDIX,"Be ye not like a feather at each wind,"
931,APPENDIX,And think not every water washes you.
932,APPENDIX,
933,APPENDIX,"Ye have the Old and the New Testament,"
934,APPENDIX,And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you
935,APPENDIX,Let this suffice you unto your salvation.
936,APPENDIX,
937,APPENDIX,"If evil appetite cry aught else to you,"
938,APPENDIX,"Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,"
939,APPENDIX,So that the Jew among you may not mock you.
940,APPENDIX,
941,APPENDIX,Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon
942,APPENDIX,"Its mother’s milk, and frolicsome and simple"
943,APPENDIX,Combats at its own pleasure with itself.”
944,APPENDIX,
945,APPENDIX,Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;
946,APPENDIX,Then all desireful turned herself again
947,APPENDIX,To that part where the world is most alive.
948,APPENDIX,
949,APPENDIX,Her silence and her change of countenance
950,APPENDIX,"Silence imposed upon my eager mind,"
951,APPENDIX,That had already in advance new questions;
952,APPENDIX,
953,APPENDIX,And as an arrow that upon the mark
954,APPENDIX,"Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,"
955,APPENDIX,So did we speed into the second realm.
956,APPENDIX,
957,APPENDIX,"My Lady there so joyful I beheld,"
958,APPENDIX,"As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,"
959,APPENDIX,More luminous thereat the planet grew;
960,APPENDIX,
961,APPENDIX,"And if the star itself was changed and smiled,"
962,APPENDIX,"What became I, who by my nature am"
963,APPENDIX,Exceeding mutable in every guise!
964,APPENDIX,
965,APPENDIX,"As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,"
966,APPENDIX,The fishes draw to that which from without
967,APPENDIX,Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;
968,APPENDIX,
969,APPENDIX,So I beheld more than a thousand splendours
970,APPENDIX,"Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:"
971,APPENDIX,"“Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”"
972,APPENDIX,
973,APPENDIX,"And as each one was coming unto us,"
974,APPENDIX,"Full of beatitude the shade was seen,"
975,APPENDIX,By the effulgence clear that issued from it.
976,APPENDIX,
977,APPENDIX,"Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning"
978,APPENDIX,"No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have"
979,APPENDIX,An agonizing need of knowing more;
980,APPENDIX,
981,APPENDIX,And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these
982,APPENDIX,"Was in desire of hearing their conditions,"
983,APPENDIX,As they unto mine eyes were manifest.
984,APPENDIX,
985,APPENDIX,"“O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes"
986,APPENDIX,"To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,"
987,APPENDIX,Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned
988,APPENDIX,
989,APPENDIX,With light that through the whole of heaven is spread
990,APPENDIX,"Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest"
991,APPENDIX,"To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.”"
992,APPENDIX,
993,APPENDIX,Thus by some one among those holy spirits
994,APPENDIX,"Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak"
995,APPENDIX,"Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”"
996,APPENDIX,
997,APPENDIX,“Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself
998,APPENDIX,"In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,"
999,APPENDIX,"Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,"
1000,APPENDIX,
1001,APPENDIX,"But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,"

1004,APPENDIX,
1005,APPENDIX,This said I in direction of the light
1006,APPENDIX,Which first had spoken to me; whence it became
1007,APPENDIX,By far more lucent than it was before.
1008,APPENDIX,
1009,APPENDIX,"Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself"
1010,APPENDIX,"By too much light, when heat has worn away"
1011,APPENDIX,"The tempering influence of the vapours dense,"
1012,APPENDIX,
1013,APPENDIX,By greater rapture thus concealed itself
1014,APPENDIX,"In its own radiance the figure saintly,"

1027,APPENDIX,"Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,"
1028,APPENDIX,
1029,APPENDIX,Two hundred years and more the bird of God
1030,APPENDIX,"In the extreme of Europe held itself,"
1031,APPENDIX,Near to the mountains whence it issued first;
1032,APPENDIX,
1033,APPENDIX,And under shadow of the sacred plumes
1034,APPENDIX,"It governed there the world from hand to hand,"
1035,APPENDIX,"And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted."
1036,APPENDIX,
1037,APPENDIX,"Caesar I was, and am Justinian,"
1038,APPENDIX,"Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,"
1039,APPENDIX,Took from the laws the useless and redundant;

1041,APPENDIX,"And ere unto the work I was attent,"
1042,APPENDIX,"One nature to exist in Christ, not more,"
1043,APPENDIX,"Believed, and with such faith was I contented."
1044,APPENDIX,
1045,APPENDIX,"But blessed Agapetus, he who was"
1046,APPENDIX,"The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere"
1047,APPENDIX,Pointed me out the way by words of his.

1049,APPENDIX,"Him I believed, and what was his assertion"

1052,APPENDIX,
1053,APPENDIX,"As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,"
1054,APPENDIX,God in his grace it pleased with this high task
1055,APPENDIX,"To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,"
1056,APPENDIX,
1057,APPENDIX,And to my Belisarius I commended
1058,APPENDIX,"The arms, to which was heaven’s right hand so joined"
1059,APPENDIX,It was a signal that I should repose.
1060,APPENDIX,
1061,APPENDIX,Now here to the first question terminates
1062,APPENDIX,My answer; but the character thereof
1063,APPENDIX,"Constrains me to continue with a sequel,"

1066,APPENDIX,"Men move against the standard sacrosanct,"
1067,APPENDIX,Both who appropriate and who oppose it.
1068,APPENDIX,
1069,APPENDIX,Behold how great a power has made it worthy
1070,APPENDIX,"Of reverence, beginning from the hour"
1071,APPENDIX,When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.
1072,APPENDIX,
1073,APPENDIX,Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode
1074,APPENDIX,"Three hundred years and upward, till at last"
1075,APPENDIX,The three to three fought for it yet again.
1076,APPENDIX,
1077,APPENDIX,Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong

1081,APPENDIX,"Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans"

1085,APPENDIX,"Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks"

1092,APPENDIX,
1093,APPENDIX,Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young
1094,APPENDIX,"Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill"
1095,APPENDIX,Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;
1096,APPENDIX,
1097,APPENDIX,"Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed"
1098,APPENDIX,"To bring the whole world to its mood serene,"
1099,APPENDIX,Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.

1104,APPENDIX,
1105,APPENDIX,"What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,"

1107,APPENDIX,That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.
1108,APPENDIX,
1109,APPENDIX,Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then
1110,APPENDIX,"Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote"
1111,APPENDIX,That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.
1112,APPENDIX,
1113,APPENDIX,"Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,"
1114,APPENDIX,"It saw again, and there where Hector lies,"
1115,APPENDIX,And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.
1116,APPENDIX,
1117,APPENDIX,From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;
1118,APPENDIX,"Then wheeled itself again into your West,"
1119,APPENDIX,Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.
1120,APPENDIX,
1121,APPENDIX,From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer
1122,APPENDIX,"Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,"
1123,APPENDIX,And Modena and Perugia dolent were;
1124,APPENDIX,
1125,APPENDIX,Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep
1126,APPENDIX,"Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,"
1127,APPENDIX,Took from the adder sudden and black death.
1128,APPENDIX,
1129,APPENDIX,With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;
1130,APPENDIX,"With him it placed the world in so great peace,"
1131,APPENDIX,That unto Janus was his temple closed.
1132,APPENDIX,
1133,APPENDIX,But what the standard that has made me speak

1135,APPENDIX,"Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,"
1136,APPENDIX,
1137,APPENDIX,"Becometh in appearance mean and dim,"

1141,APPENDIX,Because the living Justice that inspires me
1142,APPENDIX,"Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,"
1143,APPENDIX,The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.
1144,APPENDIX,
1145,APPENDIX,Now here attend to what I answer thee;
1146,APPENDIX,Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance
1147,APPENDIX,Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.
1148,APPENDIX,
1149,APPENDIX,And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten
1150,APPENDIX,"The Holy Church, then underneath its wings"
1151,APPENDIX,Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.
1152,APPENDIX,
1153,APPENDIX,Now hast thou power to judge of such as those

1156,APPENDIX,
1157,APPENDIX,To the public standard one the yellow lilies

1165,APPENDIX,"And let not this new Charles e’er strike it down,"
1166,APPENDIX,"He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons"
1167,APPENDIX,That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.
1168,APPENDIX,
1169,APPENDIX,Already oftentimes the sons have wept
1170,APPENDIX,The father’s crime; and let him not believe
1171,APPENDIX,That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.
1172,APPENDIX,
1173,APPENDIX,This little planet doth adorn itself
1174,APPENDIX,"With the good spirits that have active been,"

1177,APPENDIX,"And whensoever the desires mount thither,"
1178,APPENDIX,"Thus deviating, must perforce the rays"
1179,APPENDIX,Of the true love less vividly mount upward.
1180,APPENDIX,
1181,APPENDIX,But in commensuration of our wages
1182,APPENDIX,"With our desert is portion of our joy,"
1183,APPENDIX,Because we see them neither less nor greater.
1184,APPENDIX,
1185,APPENDIX,Herein doth living Justice sweeten so

1188,APPENDIX,
1189,APPENDIX,Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;

1194,APPENDIX,"Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom"
1195,APPENDIX,The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.
1196,APPENDIX,
1197,APPENDIX,"But the Provencals who against him wrought,"

1206,APPENDIX,"To summon to a reckoning this just man,"
1207,APPENDIX,Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.
1208,APPENDIX,
1209,APPENDIX,"Then he departed poor and stricken in years,"

1229,APPENDIX,"And to their dance this and the others moved,"
1230,APPENDIX,And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks
1231,APPENDIX,Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.

1233,APPENDIX,"Doubting was I, and saying, “Tell her, tell her,”"

1248,APPENDIX,
1249,APPENDIX,But I will speedily thy mind unloose;
1250,APPENDIX,"And do thou listen, for these words of mine"
1251,APPENDIX,Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.
1252,APPENDIX,
1253,APPENDIX,By not enduring on the power that wills
1254,APPENDIX,"Curb for his good, that man who ne’er was born,"

1261,APPENDIX,"To where the nature, which from its own Maker"

1263,APPENDIX,By the sole act of his eternal love.
1264,APPENDIX,
1265,APPENDIX,Now unto what is said direct thy sight;
1266,APPENDIX,"This nature when united to its Maker,"
1267,APPENDIX,"Such as created, was sincere and good;"
1268,APPENDIX,
1269,APPENDIX,But by itself alone was banished forth
1270,APPENDIX,"From Paradise, because it turned aside"
1271,APPENDIX,Out of the way of truth and of its life.
1272,APPENDIX,
1273,APPENDIX,"Therefore the penalty the cross held out,"

1280,APPENDIX,
1281,APPENDIX,From one act therefore issued things diverse;
1282,APPENDIX,To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;
1283,APPENDIX,Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.
1284,APPENDIX,
1285,APPENDIX,It should no longer now seem difficult

1291,APPENDIX,With great desire it waits to free itself.
1292,APPENDIX,
1293,APPENDIX,"Thou sayest, ‘Well discern I what I hear;"

1315,APPENDIX,Unto the influences of novel things.
1316,APPENDIX,
1317,APPENDIX,"The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;"

1319,APPENDIX,In that most like itself is most vivacious.
1320,APPENDIX,
1321,APPENDIX,With all of these things has advantaged been
1322,APPENDIX,"The human creature; and if one be wanting,"
1323,APPENDIX,From his nobility he needs must fall.
1324,APPENDIX,
1325,APPENDIX,"’Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,"

1332,APPENDIX,
1333,APPENDIX,Your nature when it sinned so utterly
1334,APPENDIX,"In its own seed, out of these dignities"

1336,APPENDIX,
1337,APPENDIX,"Nor could itself recover, if thou notest"
1338,APPENDIX,"With nicest subtilty, by any way,"
1339,APPENDIX,Except by passing one of these two fords:
1340,APPENDIX,
1341,APPENDIX,Either that God through clemency alone
1342,APPENDIX,"Had pardon granted, or that man himself"
1343,APPENDIX,Had satisfaction for his folly made.
1344,APPENDIX,
1345,APPENDIX,Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss
1346,APPENDIX,"Of the eternal counsel, to my speech"
1347,APPENDIX,As far as may be fastened steadfastly!
1348,APPENDIX,
1349,APPENDIX,Man in his limitations had not power
1350,APPENDIX,"To satisfy, not having power to sink"
1351,APPENDIX,"In his humility obeying then,"
1352,APPENDIX,
1353,APPENDIX,Far as he disobeying thought to rise;
1354,APPENDIX,And for this reason man has been from power
1355,APPENDIX,Of satisfying by himself excluded.
1356,APPENDIX,
1357,APPENDIX,Therefore it God behoved in his own ways
1358,APPENDIX,"Man to restore unto his perfect life,"
1359,APPENDIX,"I say in one, or else in both of them."
1360,APPENDIX,
1361,APPENDIX,But since the action of the doer is
1362,APPENDIX,"So much more grateful, as it more presents"
1363,APPENDIX,"The goodness of the heart from which it issues,"
1364,APPENDIX,
1365,APPENDIX,"Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,"
1366,APPENDIX,Has been contented to proceed by each

1369,APPENDIX,Nor ’twixt the first day and the final night
1370,APPENDIX,Such high and such magnificent proceeding
1371,APPENDIX,By one or by the other was or shall be;
1372,APPENDIX,
1373,APPENDIX,For God more bounteous was himself to give
1374,APPENDIX,"To make man able to uplift himself,"
1375,APPENDIX,Than if he only of himself had pardoned;
1376,APPENDIX,
1377,APPENDIX,And all the other modes were insufficient
1378,APPENDIX,"For justice, were it not the Son of God"
1379,APPENDIX,Himself had humbled to become incarnate.
1380,APPENDIX,
1381,APPENDIX,"Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,"
1382,APPENDIX,"Return I to elucidate one place,"

1398,APPENDIX,"And all those things which out of them are made,"
1399,APPENDIX,By a created virtue are informed.
1400,APPENDIX,
1401,APPENDIX,Created was the matter which they have;
1402,APPENDIX,Created was the informing influence
1403,APPENDIX,Within these stars that round about them go.
1404,APPENDIX,
1405,APPENDIX,The soul of every brute and of the plants

1427,APPENDIX,"Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;"

1438,APPENDIX,Took the denomination of the star

1452,APPENDIX,
1453,APPENDIX,"From a cold cloud descended never winds,"

2453,APPENDIX,"There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,"
2454,APPENDIX,"But in the divine nature Persons three,"
2455,APPENDIX,And in one person the divine and human.
2456,APPENDIX,
2457,APPENDIX,"The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,"
2458,APPENDIX,"And unto us those holy lights gave need,"
2459,APPENDIX,Growing in happiness from care to care.
2460,APPENDIX,
2461,APPENDIX,Then broke the silence of those saints concordant
2462,APPENDIX,The light in which the admirable life
2463,APPENDIX,"Of God’s own mendicant was told to me,"
2464,APPENDIX,
2465,APPENDIX,And said: “Now that one straw is trodden out
2466,APPENDIX,"Now that its seed is garnered up already,"
2467,APPENDIX,Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.
2468,APPENDIX,
2469,APPENDIX,"Into that bosom, thou believest, whence"
2470,APPENDIX,Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek
2471,APPENDIX,"Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,"
2472,APPENDIX,
2473,APPENDIX,"And into that which, by the lance transfixed,"
2474,APPENDIX,"Before and since, such satisfaction made"
2475,APPENDIX,"That it weighs down the balance of all sin,"
2476,APPENDIX,
2477,APPENDIX,Whate’er of light it has to human nature
2478,APPENDIX,Been lawful to possess was all infused
2479,APPENDIX,By the same power that both of them created;
2480,APPENDIX,
2481,APPENDIX,"And hence at what I said above dost wonder,"
2482,APPENDIX,When I narrated that no second had
2483,APPENDIX,The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.
2484,APPENDIX,
2485,APPENDIX,"Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,"
2486,APPENDIX,And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse
2487,APPENDIX,Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.
2488,APPENDIX,
2489,APPENDIX,"That which can die, and that which dieth not,"
2490,APPENDIX,Are nothing but the splendour of the idea
2491,APPENDIX,Which by his love our Lord brings into being;
2492,APPENDIX,
2493,APPENDIX,"Because that living Light, which from its fount"
2494,APPENDIX,"Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not"
2495,APPENDIX,"From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,"
2496,APPENDIX,
2497,APPENDIX,Through its own goodness reunites its rays
2498,APPENDIX,"In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,"
2499,APPENDIX,Itself eternally remaining One.
2500,APPENDIX,
2501,APPENDIX,"Thence it descends to the last potencies,"
2502,APPENDIX,Downward from act to act becoming such
2503,APPENDIX,That only brief contingencies it makes;
2504,APPENDIX,
2505,APPENDIX,And these contingencies I hold to be
2506,APPENDIX,"Things generated, which the heaven produces"
2507,APPENDIX,"By its own motion, with seed and without."
2508,APPENDIX,
2509,APPENDIX,"Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,"
2510,APPENDIX,"Remains immutable, and hence beneath"
2511,APPENDIX,The ideal signet more and less shines through;
2512,APPENDIX,
2513,APPENDIX,"Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree"
2514,APPENDIX,"After its kind bears worse and better fruit,"
2515,APPENDIX,And ye are born with characters diverse.
2516,APPENDIX,
2517,APPENDIX,"If in perfection tempered were the wax,"
2518,APPENDIX,"And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,"
2519,APPENDIX,The brilliance of the seal would all appear;
2520,APPENDIX,
2521,APPENDIX,"But nature gives it evermore deficient,"
2522,APPENDIX,"In the like manner working as the artist,"
2523,APPENDIX,Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.
2524,APPENDIX,
2525,APPENDIX,"If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,"
2526,APPENDIX,"Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,"
2527,APPENDIX,Perfection absolute is there acquired.
2528,APPENDIX,
2529,APPENDIX,Thus was of old the earth created worthy
2530,APPENDIX,Of all and every animal perfection;
2531,APPENDIX,And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;
2532,APPENDIX,
2533,APPENDIX,"So that thine own opinion I commend,"
2534,APPENDIX,"That human nature never yet has been,"

2536,APPENDIX,
2537,APPENDIX,"Now if no farther forth I should proceed,"
2538,APPENDIX,‘Then in what way was he without a peer?’
2539,APPENDIX,Would be the first beginning of thy words.
2540,APPENDIX,
2541,APPENDIX,"But, that may well appear what now appears not,"
2542,APPENDIX,"Think who he was, and what occasion moved him"
2543,APPENDIX,"To make request, when it was told him, ‘Ask.’"
2544,APPENDIX,
2545,APPENDIX,I’ve not so spoken that thou canst not see
2546,APPENDIX,"Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,"
2547,APPENDIX,That he might be sufficiently a king;
2548,APPENDIX,
2549,APPENDIX,’Twas not to know the number in which are

2555,APPENDIX,Triangle so that it have no right angle.
2556,APPENDIX,
2557,APPENDIX,"Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,"
2558,APPENDIX,A regal prudence is that peerless seeing
2559,APPENDIX,In which the shaft of my intention strikes.
2560,APPENDIX,
2561,APPENDIX,"And if on ‘rose’ thou turnest thy clear eyes,"
2562,APPENDIX,Thou’lt see that it has reference alone
2563,APPENDIX,"To kings who’re many, and the good are rare."
2564,APPENDIX,
2565,APPENDIX,"With this distinction take thou what I said,"
2566,APPENDIX,And thus it can consist with thy belief
2567,APPENDIX,Of the first father and of our Delight.
2568,APPENDIX,
2569,APPENDIX,"And lead shall this be always to thy feet,"
2570,APPENDIX,"To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly"
2571,APPENDIX,Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;
2572,APPENDIX,
2573,APPENDIX,For very low among the fools is he
2574,APPENDIX,"Who affirms without distinction, or denies,"
2575,APPENDIX,As well in one as in the other case;
2576,APPENDIX,
2577,APPENDIX,Because it happens that full often bends
2578,APPENDIX,"Current opinion in the false direction,"
2579,APPENDIX,And then the feelings bind the intellect.
2580,APPENDIX,
2581,APPENDIX,"Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,"
2582,APPENDIX,"(Since he returneth not the same he went,)"
2583,APPENDIX,"Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;"
2584,APPENDIX,
2585,APPENDIX,And in the world proofs manifest thereof
2586,APPENDIX,"Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,"
2587,APPENDIX,And many who went on and knew not whither;
2588,APPENDIX,
2589,APPENDIX,"Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools"
2590,APPENDIX,Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures
2591,APPENDIX,In rendering distorted their straight faces.
2592,APPENDIX,
2593,APPENDIX,Nor yet shall people be too confident
2594,APPENDIX,"In judging, even as he is who doth count"
2595,APPENDIX,The corn in field or ever it be ripe.
2596,APPENDIX,
2597,APPENDIX,For I have seen all winter long the thorn
2598,APPENDIX,"First show itself intractable and fierce,"
2599,APPENDIX,And after bear the rose upon its top;
2600,APPENDIX,
2601,APPENDIX,And I have seen a ship direct and swift
2602,APPENDIX,"Run o’er the sea throughout its course entire,"
2603,APPENDIX,To perish at the harbour’s mouth at last.
2604,APPENDIX,
2605,APPENDIX,"Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,"

2622,APPENDIX,"What I am saying, at the moment when"
2623,APPENDIX,"Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,"
2624,APPENDIX,
2625,APPENDIX,Because of the resemblance that was born

2628,APPENDIX,
2629,APPENDIX,"“This man has need (and does not tell you so,"

2638,APPENDIX,"After ye are again made visible,"
2639,APPENDIX,It can be that it injure not your sight.”
2640,APPENDIX,
2641,APPENDIX,As by a greater gladness urged and drawn
2642,APPENDIX,They who are dancing in a ring sometimes
2643,APPENDIX,Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;
2644,APPENDIX,
2645,APPENDIX,"So, at that orison devout and prompt,"
2646,APPENDIX,The holy circles a new joy displayed
2647,APPENDIX,In their revolving and their wondrous song.
2648,APPENDIX,
2649,APPENDIX,Whoso lamenteth him that here we die

2658,APPENDIX,"Among those spirits, with such melody"
2659,APPENDIX,That for all merit it were just reward;
2660,APPENDIX,
2661,APPENDIX,"And, in the lustre most divine of all"
2662,APPENDIX,"The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,"
2663,APPENDIX,"Such as perhaps the Angel’s was to Mary,"
2664,APPENDIX,
2665,APPENDIX,Answer: “As long as the festivity

2667,APPENDIX,Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.
2668,APPENDIX,
2669,APPENDIX,"Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,"

2673,APPENDIX,"When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh"

2677,APPENDIX,For will increase whate’er bestows on us
2678,APPENDIX,"Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,"
2679,APPENDIX,Light which enables us to look on Him;
2680,APPENDIX,
2681,APPENDIX,"Therefore the vision must perforce increase,"

2685,APPENDIX,"But even as a coal that sends forth flame,"
2686,APPENDIX,And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it
2687,APPENDIX,"So that its own appearance it maintains,"
2688,APPENDIX,
2689,APPENDIX,Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now

2701,APPENDIX,"Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,"

2703,APPENDIX,Or ever they became eternal flames.
2704,APPENDIX,
2705,APPENDIX,And lo! all round about of equal brightness
2706,APPENDIX,"Arose a lustre over what was there,"
2707,APPENDIX,Like an horizon that is clearing up.
2708,APPENDIX,
2709,APPENDIX,And as at rise of early eve begin
2710,APPENDIX,"Along the welkin new appearances,"
2711,APPENDIX,"So that the sight seems real and unreal,"
2712,APPENDIX,
2713,APPENDIX,It seemed to me that new subsistences
2714,APPENDIX,"Began there to be seen, and make a circle"
2715,APPENDIX,Outside the other two circumferences.
2716,APPENDIX,
2717,APPENDIX,"O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,"
2718,APPENDIX,How sudden and incandescent it became
2719,APPENDIX,"Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!"
2720,APPENDIX,
2721,APPENDIX,But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling
2722,APPENDIX,"Appeared to me, that with the other sights"
2723,APPENDIX,That followed not my memory I must leave her.
2724,APPENDIX,
2725,APPENDIX,Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed
2726,APPENDIX,"The power, and I beheld myself translated"
2727,APPENDIX,To higher salvation with my Lady only.
2728,APPENDIX,
2729,APPENDIX,Well was I ware that I was more uplifted
2730,APPENDIX,"By the enkindled smiling of the star,"
2731,APPENDIX,That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.
2732,APPENDIX,
2733,APPENDIX,"With all my heart, and in that dialect"
2734,APPENDIX,"Which is the same in all, such holocaust"
2735,APPENDIX,To God I made as the new grace beseemed;
2736,APPENDIX,
2737,APPENDIX,And not yet from my bosom was exhausted
2738,APPENDIX,"The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew"
2739,APPENDIX,This offering was accepted and auspicious;
2740,APPENDIX,
2741,APPENDIX,For with so great a lustre and so red
2742,APPENDIX,"Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,"
2743,APPENDIX,I said: “O Helios who dost so adorn them!”
2744,APPENDIX,
2745,APPENDIX,Even as distinct with less and greater lights
2746,APPENDIX,Glimmers between the two poles of the world
2747,APPENDIX,"The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,"
2748,APPENDIX,
2749,APPENDIX,"Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,"
2750,APPENDIX,Those rays described the venerable sign
2751,APPENDIX,That quadrants joining in a circle make.
2752,APPENDIX,
2753,APPENDIX,Here doth my memory overcome my genius;
2754,APPENDIX,"For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,"
2755,APPENDIX,So that I cannot find ensample worthy;
2756,APPENDIX,
2757,APPENDIX,But he who takes his cross and follows Christ
2758,APPENDIX,"Again will pardon me what I omit,"
2759,APPENDIX,Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.
2760,APPENDIX,
2761,APPENDIX,"From horn to horn, and ’twixt the top and base,"
2762,APPENDIX,"Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating"
2763,APPENDIX,As they together met and passed each other;
2764,APPENDIX,
2765,APPENDIX,Thus level and aslant and swift and slow
2766,APPENDIX,"We here behold, renewing still the sight,"
2767,APPENDIX,"The particles of bodies long and short,"
2768,APPENDIX,
2769,APPENDIX,"Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed"
2770,APPENDIX,"Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence"
2771,APPENDIX,People with cunning and with art contrive.
2772,APPENDIX,
2773,APPENDIX,"And as a lute and harp, accordant strung"
2774,APPENDIX,"With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make"
2775,APPENDIX,"To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,"
2776,APPENDIX,
2777,APPENDIX,So from the lights that there to me appeared
2778,APPENDIX,"Upgathered through the cross a melody,"
2779,APPENDIX,"Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn."
2780,APPENDIX,
2781,APPENDIX,"Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,"
2782,APPENDIX,"Because there came to me, “Arise and conquer!”"
2783,APPENDIX,As unto him who hears and comprehends not.
2784,APPENDIX,
2785,APPENDIX,"So much enamoured I became therewith,"
2786,APPENDIX,That until then there was not anything
2787,APPENDIX,That e’er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.
2788,APPENDIX,
2789,APPENDIX,"Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,"
2790,APPENDIX,"Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,"
2791,APPENDIX,Into which gazing my desire has rest;
2792,APPENDIX,
2793,APPENDIX,But who bethinks him that the living seals
2794,APPENDIX,"Of every beauty grow in power ascending,"
2795,APPENDIX,"And that I there had not turned round to those,"
2796,APPENDIX,
2797,APPENDIX,"Can me excuse, if I myself accuse"
2798,APPENDIX,"To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:"
2799,APPENDIX,"For here the holy joy is not disclosed,"
2800,APPENDIX,
2801,APPENDIX,Because ascending it becomes more pure.

2811,APPENDIX,"As in the iniquitous, cupidity,"
2812,APPENDIX,
2813,APPENDIX,"Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,"
2814,APPENDIX,"And quieted the consecrated chords,"
2815,APPENDIX,That Heaven’s right hand doth tighten and relax.
2816,APPENDIX,
2817,APPENDIX,How unto just entreaties shall be deaf
2818,APPENDIX,"Those substances, which, to give me desire"
2819,APPENDIX,"Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?"
2820,APPENDIX,
2821,APPENDIX,"’Tis well that without end he should lament,"
2822,APPENDIX,Who for the love of thing that doth not last
2823,APPENDIX,Eternally despoils him of that love!
2824,APPENDIX,
2825,APPENDIX,As through the pure and tranquil evening air
2826,APPENDIX,"There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,"
2827,APPENDIX,"Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,"
2828,APPENDIX,
2829,APPENDIX,"And seems to be a star that changeth place,"
2830,APPENDIX,Except that in the part where it is kindled
2831,APPENDIX,"Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;"
2832,APPENDIX,
2833,APPENDIX,So from the horn that to the right extends
2834,APPENDIX,Unto that cross’s foot there ran a star
2835,APPENDIX,Out of the constellation shining there;
2836,APPENDIX,
2837,APPENDIX,"Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,"
2838,APPENDIX,"But down the radiant fillet ran along,"
2839,APPENDIX,So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.
2840,APPENDIX,
2841,APPENDIX,"Thus piteous did Anchises’ shade reach forward,"
2842,APPENDIX,"If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,"
2843,APPENDIX,When in Elysium he his son perceived.

2848,APPENDIX,
2849,APPENDIX,Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;
2850,APPENDIX,"Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,"
2851,APPENDIX,And on this side and that was stupefied;
2852,APPENDIX,
2853,APPENDIX,For in her eyes was burning such a smile
2854,APPENDIX,That with mine own methought I touched the bottom
2855,APPENDIX,Both of my grace and of my Paradise!
2856,APPENDIX,
2857,APPENDIX,"Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,"
2858,APPENDIX,The spirit joined to its beginning things
2859,APPENDIX,"I understood not, so profound it spake;"
2860,APPENDIX,
2861,APPENDIX,"Nor did it hide itself from me by choice,"
2862,APPENDIX,But by necessity; for its conception
2863,APPENDIX,Above the mark of mortals set itself.
2864,APPENDIX,
2865,APPENDIX,And when the bow of burning sympathy
2866,APPENDIX,"Was so far slackened, that its speech descended"
2867,APPENDIX,"Towards the mark of our intelligence,"
2868,APPENDIX,
2869,APPENDIX,The first thing that was understood by me
2870,APPENDIX,"Was “Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,"
2871,APPENDIX,Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!”
2872,APPENDIX,
2873,APPENDIX,"And it continued: “Hunger long and grateful,"
2874,APPENDIX,Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume
2875,APPENDIX,"Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,"
2876,APPENDIX,
2877,APPENDIX,"Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light"
2878,APPENDIX,"In which I speak to thee, by grace of her"
2879,APPENDIX,Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.
2880,APPENDIX,
2881,APPENDIX,Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass
2882,APPENDIX,"From Him who is the first, as from the unit,"
2883,APPENDIX,"If that be known, ray out the five and six;"
2884,APPENDIX,
2885,APPENDIX,"And therefore who I am thou askest not,"
2886,APPENDIX,And why I seem more joyous unto thee
2887,APPENDIX,Than any other of this gladsome crowd.
2888,APPENDIX,
2889,APPENDIX,Thou think’st the truth; because the small and great
2890,APPENDIX,Of this existence look into the mirror
2891,APPENDIX,"Wherein, before thou think’st, thy thought thou showest."
2892,APPENDIX,
2893,APPENDIX,"But that the sacred love, in which I watch"
2894,APPENDIX,"With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst"
2895,APPENDIX,"With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,"
2896,APPENDIX,
2897,APPENDIX,Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad
2898,APPENDIX,"Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,"
2899,APPENDIX,To which my answer is decreed already.”
2900,APPENDIX,
2901,APPENDIX,"To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard"
2902,APPENDIX,"Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,"
2903,APPENDIX,That made the wings of my desire increase;
2904,APPENDIX,
2905,APPENDIX,"Then in this wise began I: “Love and knowledge,"
2906,APPENDIX,"When on you dawned the first Equality,"
2907,APPENDIX,Of the same weight for each of you became;
2908,APPENDIX,
2909,APPENDIX,"For in the Sun, which lighted you and burned"
2910,APPENDIX,"With heat and radiance, they so equal are,"
2911,APPENDIX,That all similitudes are insufficient.
2912,APPENDIX,
2913,APPENDIX,"But among mortals will and argument,"
2914,APPENDIX,"For reason that to you is manifest,"
2915,APPENDIX,Diversely feathered in their pinions are.
2916,APPENDIX,
2917,APPENDIX,"Whence I, who mortal am, feel in myself"
2918,APPENDIX,"This inequality; so give not thanks,"
2919,APPENDIX,"Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome."
2920,APPENDIX,
2921,APPENDIX,"Truly do I entreat thee, living topaz!"
2922,APPENDIX,"Set in this precious jewel as a gem,"
2923,APPENDIX,That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name.”
2924,APPENDIX,
2925,APPENDIX,"“O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took"
2926,APPENDIX,"E’en while awaiting, I was thine own root!”"
2927,APPENDIX,Such a beginning he in answer made me.
2928,APPENDIX,
2929,APPENDIX,Then said to me: “That one from whom is named
2930,APPENDIX,"Thy race, and who a hundred years and more"
2931,APPENDIX,"Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,"

2944,APPENDIX,
2945,APPENDIX,Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear
2946,APPENDIX,"Into the father, for the time and dower"
2947,APPENDIX,Did not o’errun this side or that the measure.
2948,APPENDIX,
2949,APPENDIX,"No houses had she void of families,"

2965,APPENDIX,O fortunate women! and each one was certain

3041,APPENDIX,"Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral,"

3125,APPENDIX,Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing

3148,APPENDIX,
3149,APPENDIX,"Mighty already was the Column Vair,"

3153,APPENDIX,The stock from which were the Calfucci born
3154,APPENDIX,"Was great already, and already chosen"

3156,APPENDIX,
3157,APPENDIX,O how beheld I those who are undone
3158,APPENDIX,By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold
3159,APPENDIX,Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!
3160,APPENDIX,
3161,APPENDIX,So likewise did the ancestors of those

3208,APPENDIX,
3209,APPENDIX,"With all these families, and others with them,"

3213,APPENDIX,With all these families beheld so just

3236,APPENDIX,
3237,APPENDIX,Not that our knowledge may be greater made

3269,APPENDIX,But with clear words and unambiguous

3272,APPENDIX,
3273,APPENDIX,"“Contingency, that outside of the volume"

3289,APPENDIX,"Already this is willed, and this is sought for;"

3317,APPENDIX,Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn
3318,APPENDIX,"Shall be the mighty Lombard’s courtesy,"

3336,APPENDIX,
3337,APPENDIX,So recognized shall his magnificence

3348,APPENDIX,
3349,APPENDIX,"Then added: “Son, these are the commentaries"

3356,APPENDIX,
3357,APPENDIX,When by its silence showed that sainted soul
3358,APPENDIX,That it had finished putting in the woof
3359,APPENDIX,"Into that web which I had given it warped,"
3360,APPENDIX,
3361,APPENDIX,"Began I, even as he who yearneth after,"

3364,APPENDIX,
3365,APPENDIX,"“Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on"
3366,APPENDIX,The time towards me such a blow to deal me
3367,APPENDIX,As heaviest is to him who most gives way.
3368,APPENDIX,
3369,APPENDIX,"Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,"
3370,APPENDIX,"That, if the dearest place be taken from me,"
3371,APPENDIX,I may not lose the others by my songs.
3372,APPENDIX,
3373,APPENDIX,"Down through the world of infinite bitterness,"
3374,APPENDIX,"And o’er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit"
3375,APPENDIX,"The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,"
3376,APPENDIX,
3377,APPENDIX,"And afterward through heaven from light to light,"
3378,APPENDIX,"I have learned that which, if I tell again,"
3379,APPENDIX,Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.
3380,APPENDIX,
3381,APPENDIX,"And if I am a timid friend to truth,"
3382,APPENDIX,I fear lest I may lose my life with those
3383,APPENDIX,Who will hereafter call this time the olden.”
3384,APPENDIX,
3385,APPENDIX,The light in which was smiling my own treasure
3386,APPENDIX,"Which there I had discovered, flashed at first"
3387,APPENDIX,As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;
3388,APPENDIX,
3389,APPENDIX,Then made reply: “A conscience overcast

3392,APPENDIX,
3393,APPENDIX,"But ne’ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,"
3394,APPENDIX,"Make manifest thy vision utterly,"
3395,APPENDIX,And let them scratch wherever is the itch;

3397,APPENDIX,For if thine utterance shall offensive be

3400,APPENDIX,
3401,APPENDIX,"This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,"

3407,APPENDIX,Only the souls that unto fame are known;

3418,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto XVIII
3419,APPENDIX,
3420,APPENDIX,
3421,APPENDIX,Now was alone rejoicing in its word
3422,APPENDIX,"That soul beatified, and I was tasting"
3423,APPENDIX,"My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,"
3424,APPENDIX,
3425,APPENDIX,And the Lady who to God was leading me
3426,APPENDIX,Said: “Change thy thought; consider that I am
3427,APPENDIX,Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.”
3428,APPENDIX,
3429,APPENDIX,Unto the loving accents of my comfort
3430,APPENDIX,"I turned me round, and then what love I saw"
3431,APPENDIX,Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;
3432,APPENDIX,
3433,APPENDIX,"Not only that my language I distrust,"
3434,APPENDIX,But that my mind cannot return so far
3435,APPENDIX,"Above itself, unless another guide it."
3436,APPENDIX,
3437,APPENDIX,"Thus much upon that point can I repeat,"
3438,APPENDIX,"That, her again beholding, my affection"
3439,APPENDIX,From every other longing was released.
3440,APPENDIX,
3441,APPENDIX,"While the eternal pleasure, which direct"
3442,APPENDIX,"Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face"
3443,APPENDIX,"Contented me with its reflected aspect,"
3444,APPENDIX,
3445,APPENDIX,"Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,"
3446,APPENDIX,"She said to me, “Turn thee about and listen;"
3447,APPENDIX,Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.”
3448,APPENDIX,
3449,APPENDIX,Even as sometimes here do we behold
3450,APPENDIX,"The affection in the look, if it be such"
3451,APPENDIX,"That all the soul is wrapt away by it,"
3452,APPENDIX,
3453,APPENDIX,"So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy"
3454,APPENDIX,"To which I turned, I recognized therein"
3455,APPENDIX,The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.
3456,APPENDIX,
3457,APPENDIX,And it began: “In this fifth resting-place
3458,APPENDIX,"Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,"
3459,APPENDIX,"And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,"
3460,APPENDIX,
3461,APPENDIX,"Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet"
3462,APPENDIX,"They came to Heaven, were of such great renown"
3463,APPENDIX,That every Muse therewith would affluent be.
3464,APPENDIX,
3465,APPENDIX,Therefore look thou upon the cross’s horns;
3466,APPENDIX,He whom I now shall name will there enact
3467,APPENDIX,What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.”
3468,APPENDIX,
3469,APPENDIX,I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn
3470,APPENDIX,"By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)"
3471,APPENDIX,Nor noted I the word before the deed;
3472,APPENDIX,
3473,APPENDIX,And at the name of the great Maccabee
3474,APPENDIX,"I saw another move itself revolving,"
3475,APPENDIX,And gladness was the whip unto that top.
3476,APPENDIX,
3477,APPENDIX,"Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,"
3478,APPENDIX,Two of them my regard attentive followed
3479,APPENDIX,As followeth the eye its falcon flying.
3480,APPENDIX,
3481,APPENDIX,"William thereafterward, and Renouard,"
3482,APPENDIX,"And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight"
3483,APPENDIX,"Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard."
3484,APPENDIX,
3485,APPENDIX,"Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,"
3486,APPENDIX,The soul that had addressed me showed how great
3487,APPENDIX,An artist ’twas among the heavenly singers.
3488,APPENDIX,
3489,APPENDIX,"To my right side I turned myself around,"
3490,APPENDIX,My duty to behold in Beatrice
3491,APPENDIX,Either by words or gesture signified;
3492,APPENDIX,
3493,APPENDIX,"And so translucent I beheld her eyes,"
3494,APPENDIX,"So full of pleasure, that her countenance"
3495,APPENDIX,Surpassed its other and its latest wont.
3496,APPENDIX,
3497,APPENDIX,"And as, by feeling greater delectation,"
3498,APPENDIX,A man in doing good from day to day
3499,APPENDIX,"Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,"
3500,APPENDIX,
3501,APPENDIX,So I became aware that my gyration
3502,APPENDIX,"With heaven together had increased its arc,"
3503,APPENDIX,That miracle beholding more adorned.
3504,APPENDIX,
3505,APPENDIX,"And such as is the change, in little lapse"
3506,APPENDIX,"Of time, in a pale woman, when her face"
3507,APPENDIX,"Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,"
3508,APPENDIX,
3509,APPENDIX,"Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,"
3510,APPENDIX,"Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,"
3511,APPENDIX,"The sixth, which to itself had gathered me."
3512,APPENDIX,
3513,APPENDIX,Within that Jovial torch did I behold
3514,APPENDIX,The sparkling of the love which was therein
3515,APPENDIX,Delineate our language to mine eyes.
3516,APPENDIX,
3517,APPENDIX,"And even as birds uprisen from the shore,"
3518,APPENDIX,"As in congratulation o’er their food,"
3519,APPENDIX,"Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,"
3520,APPENDIX,
3521,APPENDIX,So from within those lights the holy creatures
3522,APPENDIX,"Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures"
3523,APPENDIX,"Made of themselves now D, now I, now L."
3524,APPENDIX,
3525,APPENDIX,First singing they to their own music moved;
3526,APPENDIX,"Then one becoming of these characters,"
3527,APPENDIX,A little while they rested and were silent.
3528,APPENDIX,
3529,APPENDIX,"O divine Pegasea, thou who genius"
3530,APPENDIX,"Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,"
3531,APPENDIX,"And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,"
3532,APPENDIX,
3533,APPENDIX,"Illume me with thyself, that I may bring"
3534,APPENDIX,Their figures out as I have them conceived!
3535,APPENDIX,Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!
3536,APPENDIX,
3537,APPENDIX,Themselves then they displayed in five times seven
3538,APPENDIX,Vowels and consonants; and I observed
3539,APPENDIX,The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.
3540,APPENDIX,
3541,APPENDIX,"‘Diligite justitiam,’ these were"
3542,APPENDIX,First verb and noun of all that was depicted;
3543,APPENDIX,‘Qui judicatis terram’ were the last.
3544,APPENDIX,
3545,APPENDIX,Thereafter in the M of the fifth word
3546,APPENDIX,"Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter"
3547,APPENDIX,Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.
3548,APPENDIX,
3549,APPENDIX,And other lights I saw descend where was
3550,APPENDIX,"The summit of the M, and pause there singing"
3551,APPENDIX,"The good, I think, that draws them to itself."
3552,APPENDIX,
3553,APPENDIX,"Then, as in striking upon burning logs"
3554,APPENDIX,"Upward there fly innumerable sparks,"
3555,APPENDIX,"Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,"
3556,APPENDIX,
3557,APPENDIX,"More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,"
3558,APPENDIX,"And to ascend, some more, and others less,"
3559,APPENDIX,Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;
3560,APPENDIX,
3561,APPENDIX,"And, each one being quiet in its place,"
3562,APPENDIX,The head and neck beheld I of an eagle
3563,APPENDIX,Delineated by that inlaid fire.
3564,APPENDIX,
3565,APPENDIX,He who there paints has none to be his guide;
3566,APPENDIX,But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered
3567,APPENDIX,That virtue which is form unto the nest.
3568,APPENDIX,
3569,APPENDIX,"The other beatitude, that contented seemed"
3570,APPENDIX,"At first to bloom a lily on the M,"
3571,APPENDIX,By a slight motion followed out the imprint.
3572,APPENDIX,
3573,APPENDIX,O gentle star! what and how many gems
3574,APPENDIX,"Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice"
3575,APPENDIX,Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!
3576,APPENDIX,
3577,APPENDIX,"Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin"
3578,APPENDIX,"Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard"
3579,APPENDIX,Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;
3580,APPENDIX,
3581,APPENDIX,So that a second time it now be wroth
3582,APPENDIX,With buying and with selling in the temple
3583,APPENDIX,Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!
3584,APPENDIX,
3585,APPENDIX,"O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,"
3586,APPENDIX,Implore for those who are upon the earth
3587,APPENDIX,All gone astray after the bad example!
3588,APPENDIX,
3589,APPENDIX,Once ’twas the custom to make war with swords;
3590,APPENDIX,But now ’tis made by taking here and there
3591,APPENDIX,The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.
3592,APPENDIX,
3593,APPENDIX,"Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think"
3594,APPENDIX,"That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard"
3595,APPENDIX,"Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!"
3596,APPENDIX,
3597,APPENDIX,Well canst thou say: “So steadfast my desire
3598,APPENDIX,"Is unto him who willed to live alone,"
3599,APPENDIX,"And for a dance was led to martyrdom,"
3600,APPENDIX,
3601,APPENDIX,That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.”

3603,APPENDIX,
3604,APPENDIX,
3605,APPENDIX,
3606,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto XIX
3607,APPENDIX,
3608,APPENDIX,
3609,APPENDIX,Appeared before me with its wings outspread
3610,APPENDIX,The beautiful image that in sweet fruition
3611,APPENDIX,Made jubilant the interwoven souls;
3612,APPENDIX,
3613,APPENDIX,"Appeared a little ruby each, wherein"
3614,APPENDIX,Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled
3615,APPENDIX,That each into mine eyes refracted it.
3616,APPENDIX,
3617,APPENDIX,And what it now behoves me to retrace
3618,APPENDIX,"Nor voice has e’er reported, nor ink written,"
3619,APPENDIX,Nor was by fantasy e’er comprehended;
3620,APPENDIX,
3621,APPENDIX,"For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,"
3622,APPENDIX,"And utter with its voice both ‘I’ and ‘My,’"
3623,APPENDIX,When in conception it was ‘We’ and ‘Our.’
3624,APPENDIX,
3625,APPENDIX,And it began: “Being just and merciful
3626,APPENDIX,Am I exalted here unto that glory
3627,APPENDIX,Which cannot be exceeded by desire;
3628,APPENDIX,
3629,APPENDIX,And upon earth I left my memory
3630,APPENDIX,"Such, that the evil-minded people there"
3631,APPENDIX,"Commend it, but continue not the story.”"
3632,APPENDIX,
3633,APPENDIX,So doth a single heat from many embers
3634,APPENDIX,"Make itself felt, even as from many loves"
3635,APPENDIX,Issued a single sound from out that image.
3636,APPENDIX,
3637,APPENDIX,Whence I thereafter: “O perpetual flowers
3638,APPENDIX,"Of the eternal joy, that only one"
3639,APPENDIX,"Make me perceive your odours manifold,"
3640,APPENDIX,
3641,APPENDIX,"Exhaling, break within me the great fast"
3642,APPENDIX,"Which a long season has in hunger held me,"
3643,APPENDIX,Not finding for it any food on earth.
3644,APPENDIX,
3645,APPENDIX,"Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror"
3646,APPENDIX,"Justice Divine another realm doth make,"
3647,APPENDIX,Yours apprehends it not through any veil.
3648,APPENDIX,
3649,APPENDIX,You know how I attentively address me
3650,APPENDIX,To listen; and you know what is the doubt
3651,APPENDIX,That is in me so very old a fast.”
3652,APPENDIX,
3653,APPENDIX,"Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,"
3654,APPENDIX,"Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,"
3655,APPENDIX,"Showing desire, and making himself fine,"
3656,APPENDIX,
3657,APPENDIX,"Saw I become that standard, which of lauds"
3658,APPENDIX,"Was interwoven of the grace divine,"
3659,APPENDIX,With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.
3660,APPENDIX,
3661,APPENDIX,Then it began: “He who a compass turned
3662,APPENDIX,"On the world’s outer verge, and who within it"
3663,APPENDIX,"Devised so much occult and manifest,"
3664,APPENDIX,
3665,APPENDIX,Could not the impress of his power so make
3666,APPENDIX,"On all the universe, as that his Word"
3667,APPENDIX,Should not remain in infinite excess.
3668,APPENDIX,
3669,APPENDIX,"And this makes certain that the first proud being,"
3670,APPENDIX,"Who was the paragon of every creature,"
3671,APPENDIX,By not awaiting light fell immature.
3672,APPENDIX,
3673,APPENDIX,"And hence appears it, that each minor nature"
3674,APPENDIX,Is scant receptacle unto that good
3675,APPENDIX,"Which has no end, and by itself is measured."
3676,APPENDIX,
3677,APPENDIX,"In consequence our vision, which perforce"
3678,APPENDIX,Must be some ray of that intelligence
3679,APPENDIX,"With which all things whatever are replete,"
3680,APPENDIX,
3681,APPENDIX,"Cannot in its own nature be so potent,"
3682,APPENDIX,That it shall not its origin discern
3683,APPENDIX,Far beyond that which is apparent to it.
3684,APPENDIX,
3685,APPENDIX,Therefore into the justice sempiternal
3686,APPENDIX,"The power of vision that your world receives,"
3687,APPENDIX,"As eye into the ocean, penetrates;"
3688,APPENDIX,
3689,APPENDIX,"Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,"
3690,APPENDIX,"Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet"
3691,APPENDIX,"’Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth."
3692,APPENDIX,
3693,APPENDIX,There is no light but comes from the serene
3694,APPENDIX,"That never is o’ercast, nay, it is darkness"
3695,APPENDIX,"Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison."
3696,APPENDIX,
3697,APPENDIX,Amply to thee is opened now the cavern
3698,APPENDIX,Which has concealed from thee the living justice
3699,APPENDIX,Of which thou mad’st such frequent questioning.
3700,APPENDIX,
3701,APPENDIX,For saidst thou: ‘Born a man is on the shore
3702,APPENDIX,"Of Indus, and is none who there can speak"
3703,APPENDIX,"Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;"
3704,APPENDIX,
3705,APPENDIX,And all his inclinations and his actions
3706,APPENDIX,"Are good, so far as human reason sees,"
3707,APPENDIX,Without a sin in life or in discourse:
3708,APPENDIX,
3709,APPENDIX,He dieth unbaptised and without faith;
3710,APPENDIX,Where is this justice that condemneth him?
3711,APPENDIX,"Where is his fault, if he do not believe?’"
3712,APPENDIX,
3713,APPENDIX,"Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit"
3714,APPENDIX,"In judgment at a thousand miles away,"
3715,APPENDIX,With the short vision of a single span?
3716,APPENDIX,
3717,APPENDIX,"Truly to him who with me subtilizes,"
3718,APPENDIX,"If so the Scripture were not over you,"
3719,APPENDIX,For doubting there were marvellous occasion.
3720,APPENDIX,
3721,APPENDIX,"O animals terrene, O stolid minds,"
3722,APPENDIX,"The primal will, that in itself is good,"
3723,APPENDIX,"Ne’er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved."
3724,APPENDIX,
3725,APPENDIX,So much is just as is accordant with it;
3726,APPENDIX,"No good created draws it to itself,"
3727,APPENDIX,"But it, by raying forth, occasions that.”"
3728,APPENDIX,
3729,APPENDIX,Even as above her nest goes circling round
3730,APPENDIX,"The stork when she has fed her little ones,"
3731,APPENDIX,"And he who has been fed looks up at her,"
3732,APPENDIX,
3733,APPENDIX,"So lifted I my brows, and even such"
3734,APPENDIX,"Became the blessed image, which its wings"
3735,APPENDIX,"Was moving, by so many counsels urged."
3736,APPENDIX,
3737,APPENDIX,"Circling around it sang, and said: “As are"
3738,APPENDIX,"My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,"
3739,APPENDIX,Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.”
3740,APPENDIX,
3741,APPENDIX,Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit
3742,APPENDIX,"Grew quiet then, but still within the standard"
3743,APPENDIX,That made the Romans reverend to the world.
3744,APPENDIX,
3745,APPENDIX,It recommenced: “Unto this kingdom never
3746,APPENDIX,"Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,"
3747,APPENDIX,Before or since he to the tree was nailed.
3748,APPENDIX,
3749,APPENDIX,"But look thou, many crying are, ‘Christ, Christ!’"
3750,APPENDIX,Who at the judgment shall be far less near
3751,APPENDIX,To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.
3752,APPENDIX,
3753,APPENDIX,"Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,"
3754,APPENDIX,"When the two companies shall be divided,"
3755,APPENDIX,"The one for ever rich, the other poor."
3756,APPENDIX,
3757,APPENDIX,"What to your kings may not the Persians say,"
3758,APPENDIX,When they that volume opened shall behold
3759,APPENDIX,In which are written down all their dispraises?
3760,APPENDIX,
3761,APPENDIX,"There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,"
3762,APPENDIX,"That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,"
3763,APPENDIX,For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.
3764,APPENDIX,
3765,APPENDIX,There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine
3766,APPENDIX,"He brings by falsifying of the coin,"
3767,APPENDIX,Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.
3768,APPENDIX,
3769,APPENDIX,"There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,"
3770,APPENDIX,Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad
3771,APPENDIX,That they within their boundaries cannot rest;
3772,APPENDIX,
3773,APPENDIX,Be seen the luxury and effeminate life
3774,APPENDIX,"Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,"
3775,APPENDIX,Who valour never knew and never wished;
3776,APPENDIX,
3777,APPENDIX,"Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,"
3778,APPENDIX,"His goodness represented by an I,"
3779,APPENDIX,While the reverse an M shall represent;
3780,APPENDIX,
3781,APPENDIX,Be seen the avarice and poltroonery
3782,APPENDIX,"Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,"
3783,APPENDIX,Wherein Anchises finished his long life;
3784,APPENDIX,
3785,APPENDIX,And to declare how pitiful he is
3786,APPENDIX,Shall be his record in contracted letters
3787,APPENDIX,Which shall make note of much in little space.
3788,APPENDIX,
3789,APPENDIX,And shall appear to each one the foul deeds
3790,APPENDIX,Of uncle and of brother who a nation
3791,APPENDIX,"So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns."
3792,APPENDIX,
3793,APPENDIX,And he of Portugal and he of Norway
3794,APPENDIX,"Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,"
3795,APPENDIX,Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.
3796,APPENDIX,
3797,APPENDIX,"O happy Hungary, if she let herself"
3798,APPENDIX,"Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,"
3799,APPENDIX,If with the hills that gird her she be armed!
3800,APPENDIX,
3801,APPENDIX,"And each one may believe that now, as hansel"

3815,APPENDIX,"That on all sides the daylight is consumed,"
3816,APPENDIX,
3817,APPENDIX,"The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,"
3818,APPENDIX,Doth suddenly reveal itself again

3824,APPENDIX,
3825,APPENDIX,"Because those living luminaries all,"

3835,APPENDIX,"Silence imposed on the angelic bells,"
3836,APPENDIX,
3837,APPENDIX,I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river
3838,APPENDIX,"That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,"
3839,APPENDIX,Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.
3840,APPENDIX,
3841,APPENDIX,And as the sound upon the cithern’s neck
3842,APPENDIX,"Taketh its form, and as upon the vent"
3843,APPENDIX,"Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,"
3844,APPENDIX,
3845,APPENDIX,"Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,"
3846,APPENDIX,That murmuring of the eagle mounted up
3847,APPENDIX,"Along its neck, as if it had been hollow."
3848,APPENDIX,
3849,APPENDIX,"There it became a voice, and issued thence"
3850,APPENDIX,"From out its beak, in such a form of words"

3876,APPENDIX,
3877,APPENDIX,He who comes next in the circumference

3916,APPENDIX,
3917,APPENDIX,And notwithstanding to my doubt I was
3918,APPENDIX,"As glass is to the colour that invests it,"

3920,APPENDIX,
3921,APPENDIX,"But forth from out my mouth, “What things are these?”"
3922,APPENDIX,Extorted with the force of its own weight;
3923,APPENDIX,Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.
3924,APPENDIX,
3925,APPENDIX,Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled
3926,APPENDIX,"The blessed standard made to me reply,"
3927,APPENDIX,To keep me not in wonderment suspended:
3928,APPENDIX,
3929,APPENDIX,“I see that thou believest in these things

3957,APPENDIX,"Of living hope, that placed its efficacy"

3961,APPENDIX,"The glorious soul concerning which I speak,"
3962,APPENDIX,"Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,"

3974,APPENDIX,Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose
3975,APPENDIX,"His eye to our redemption yet to be,"
3976,APPENDIX,
3977,APPENDIX,"Whence he believed therein, and suffered not"

3996,APPENDIX,
3997,APPENDIX,"After this manner by that shape divine,"
3998,APPENDIX,"To make clear in me my short-sightedness,"
3999,APPENDIX,Was given to me a pleasant medicine;

4060,APPENDIX,
4061,APPENDIX,And as accordant with their natural custom

4089,APPENDIX,Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed

4138,APPENDIX,"That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,"
4139,APPENDIX,Could this demand of thine not satisfy;
4140,APPENDIX,
4141,APPENDIX,Because so deeply sinks in the abyss
4142,APPENDIX,"Of the eternal statute what thou askest,"
4143,APPENDIX,From all created sight it is cut off.

4152,APPENDIX,
4153,APPENDIX,"Such limit did its words prescribe to me,"
4154,APPENDIX,"The question I relinquished, and restricted"

4172,APPENDIX,
4173,APPENDIX,That cloister used to render to these heavens
4174,APPENDIX,"Abundantly, and now is empty grown,"
4175,APPENDIX,So that perforce it soon must be revealed.
4176,APPENDIX,

4225,APPENDIX,After what wise the singing would have changed thee
4226,APPENDIX,"And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,"

4240,APPENDIX,
4241,APPENDIX,"As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,"

4305,APPENDIX,Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it
4306,APPENDIX,"Extending its supernal part, what time"

4344,APPENDIX,
4345,APPENDIX,The gentle Lady urged me on behind them
4346,APPENDIX,"Up o’er that stairway by a single sign,"
4347,APPENDIX,So did her virtue overcome my nature;
4348,APPENDIX,
4349,APPENDIX,"Nor here below, where one goes up and down"
4350,APPENDIX,"By natural law, was motion e’er so swift"
4351,APPENDIX,That it could be compared unto my wing.

4355,APPENDIX,"For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,—"
4356,APPENDIX,
4357,APPENDIX,Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire

4366,APPENDIX,"He who is father of all mortal life,"
4367,APPENDIX,When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;
4368,APPENDIX,
4369,APPENDIX,And then when grace was freely given to me
4370,APPENDIX,"To enter the high wheel which turns you round,"
4371,APPENDIX,Your region was allotted unto me.
4372,APPENDIX,
4373,APPENDIX,To you devoutly at this hour my soul
4374,APPENDIX,"Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire"
4375,APPENDIX,For the stern pass that draws it to itself.
4376,APPENDIX,
4377,APPENDIX,"“Thou art so near unto the last salvation,”"
4378,APPENDIX,"Thus Beatrice began, “thou oughtest now"
4379,APPENDIX,To have thine eves unclouded and acute;
4380,APPENDIX,
4381,APPENDIX,"And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,"
4382,APPENDIX,"Look down once more, and see how vast a world"
4383,APPENDIX,Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;
4384,APPENDIX,
4385,APPENDIX,"So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,"
4386,APPENDIX,Present itself to the triumphant throng
4387,APPENDIX,That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.”
4388,APPENDIX,
4389,APPENDIX,I with my sight returned through one and all
4390,APPENDIX,"The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe"
4391,APPENDIX,Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;
4392,APPENDIX,
4393,APPENDIX,And that opinion I approve as best
4394,APPENDIX,Which doth account it least; and he who thinks
4395,APPENDIX,Of something else may truly be called just.
4396,APPENDIX,
4397,APPENDIX,I saw the daughter of Latona shining
4398,APPENDIX,"Without that shadow, which to me was cause"
4399,APPENDIX,That once I had believed her rare and dense.
4400,APPENDIX,
4401,APPENDIX,"The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,"
4402,APPENDIX,"Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves"
4403,APPENDIX,Around and near him Maia and Dione.
4404,APPENDIX,
4405,APPENDIX,Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove
4406,APPENDIX,"’Twixt son and father, and to me was clear"
4407,APPENDIX,The change that of their whereabout they make;
4408,APPENDIX,
4409,APPENDIX,And all the seven made manifest to me
4410,APPENDIX,"How great they are, and eke how swift they are,"
4411,APPENDIX,And how they are in distant habitations.
4412,APPENDIX,
4413,APPENDIX,"The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,"
4414,APPENDIX,"To me revolving with the eternal Twins,"
4415,APPENDIX,Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!
4416,APPENDIX,
4417,APPENDIX,Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.

4421,APPENDIX,
4422,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto XXIII
4423,APPENDIX,
4424,APPENDIX,
4425,APPENDIX,"Even as a bird, ’mid the beloved leaves,"
4426,APPENDIX,Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood
4427,APPENDIX,"Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,"
4428,APPENDIX,
4429,APPENDIX,"Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks"
4430,APPENDIX,"And find the food wherewith to nourish them,"
4431,APPENDIX,"In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,"
4432,APPENDIX,
4433,APPENDIX,Anticipates the time on open spray
4434,APPENDIX,"And with an ardent longing waits the sun,"
4435,APPENDIX,Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:
4436,APPENDIX,
4437,APPENDIX,"Even thus my Lady standing was, erect"
4438,APPENDIX,"And vigilant, turned round towards the zone"
4439,APPENDIX,Underneath which the sun displays less haste;
4440,APPENDIX,
4441,APPENDIX,"So that beholding her distraught and wistful,"
4442,APPENDIX,Such I became as he is who desiring
4443,APPENDIX,"For something yearns, and hoping is appeased."
4444,APPENDIX,
4445,APPENDIX,But brief the space from one When to the other;
4446,APPENDIX,"Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing"
4447,APPENDIX,The welkin grow resplendent more and more.
4448,APPENDIX,
4449,APPENDIX,And Beatrice exclaimed: “Behold the hosts
4450,APPENDIX,"Of Christ’s triumphal march, and all the fruit"
4451,APPENDIX,Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!”
4452,APPENDIX,
4453,APPENDIX,It seemed to me her face was all aflame;
4454,APPENDIX,And eyes she had so full of ecstasy
4455,APPENDIX,That I must needs pass on without describing.
4456,APPENDIX,
4457,APPENDIX,As when in nights serene of the full moon
4458,APPENDIX,Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal
4459,APPENDIX,"Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,"
4460,APPENDIX,
4461,APPENDIX,"Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,"
4462,APPENDIX,"A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,"
4463,APPENDIX,"E’en as our own doth the supernal sights,"
4464,APPENDIX,
4465,APPENDIX,And through the living light transparent shone
4466,APPENDIX,The lucent substance so intensely clear
4467,APPENDIX,"Into my sight, that I sustained it not."
4468,APPENDIX,
4469,APPENDIX,"O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!"
4470,APPENDIX,To me she said: “What overmasters thee
4471,APPENDIX,A virtue is from which naught shields itself.
4472,APPENDIX,
4473,APPENDIX,There are the wisdom and the omnipotence
4474,APPENDIX,"That oped the thoroughfares ’twixt heaven and earth,"
4475,APPENDIX,For which there erst had been so long a yearning.”
4476,APPENDIX,
4477,APPENDIX,"As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,"
4478,APPENDIX,"Dilating so it finds not room therein,"
4479,APPENDIX,"And down, against its nature, falls to earth,"
4480,APPENDIX,
4481,APPENDIX,"So did my mind, among those aliments"
4482,APPENDIX,"Becoming larger, issue from itself,"
4483,APPENDIX,And that which it became cannot remember.
4484,APPENDIX,
4485,APPENDIX,"“Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:"
4486,APPENDIX,"Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough"
4487,APPENDIX,Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.”
4488,APPENDIX,
4489,APPENDIX,I was as one who still retains the feeling
4490,APPENDIX,"Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours"
4491,APPENDIX,"In vain to bring it back into his mind,"
4492,APPENDIX,
4493,APPENDIX,"When I this invitation heard, deserving"
4494,APPENDIX,"Of so much gratitude, it never fades"
4495,APPENDIX,Out of the book that chronicles the past.
4496,APPENDIX,
4497,APPENDIX,If at this moment sounded all the tongues
4498,APPENDIX,That Polyhymnia and her sisters made
4499,APPENDIX,"Most lubrical with their delicious milk,"
4500,APPENDIX,
4501,APPENDIX,"To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth"
4502,APPENDIX,"It would not reach, singing the holy smile"
4503,APPENDIX,And how the holy aspect it illumed.
4504,APPENDIX,
4505,APPENDIX,"And therefore, representing Paradise,"
4506,APPENDIX,"The sacred poem must perforce leap over,"
4507,APPENDIX,Even as a man who finds his way cut off;
4508,APPENDIX,
4509,APPENDIX,"But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,"
4510,APPENDIX,"And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,"
4511,APPENDIX,"Should blame it not, if under this it tremble."
4512,APPENDIX,
4513,APPENDIX,It is no passage for a little boat
4514,APPENDIX,"This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,"
4515,APPENDIX,Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.
4516,APPENDIX,
4517,APPENDIX,"“Why doth my face so much enamour thee,"
4518,APPENDIX,"That to the garden fair thou turnest not,"
4519,APPENDIX,Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?
4520,APPENDIX,
4521,APPENDIX,There is the Rose in which the Word Divine
4522,APPENDIX,Became incarnate; there the lilies are
4523,APPENDIX,By whose perfume the good way was discovered.”
4524,APPENDIX,
4525,APPENDIX,"Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels"
4526,APPENDIX,"Was wholly ready, once again betook me"
4527,APPENDIX,Unto the battle of the feeble brows.
4528,APPENDIX,
4529,APPENDIX,"As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams"
4530,APPENDIX,"Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers"
4531,APPENDIX,"Mine eyes with shadow covered o’er have seen,"
4532,APPENDIX,
4533,APPENDIX,So troops of splendours manifold I saw
4534,APPENDIX,"Illumined from above with burning rays,"
4535,APPENDIX,Beholding not the source of the effulgence.
4536,APPENDIX,
4537,APPENDIX,O power benignant that dost so imprint them!
4538,APPENDIX,Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope
4539,APPENDIX,"There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough."
4540,APPENDIX,
4541,APPENDIX,The name of that fair flower I e’er invoke
4542,APPENDIX,Morning and evening utterly enthralled
4543,APPENDIX,My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.
4544,APPENDIX,
4545,APPENDIX,And when in both mine eyes depicted were
4546,APPENDIX,The glory and greatness of the living star
4547,APPENDIX,"Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,"
4548,APPENDIX,
4549,APPENDIX,Athwart the heavens a little torch descended
4550,APPENDIX,"Formed in a circle like a coronal,"
4551,APPENDIX,"And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it."
4552,APPENDIX,
4553,APPENDIX,Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth
4554,APPENDIX,"On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,"
4555,APPENDIX,"Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,"
4556,APPENDIX,
4557,APPENDIX,Compared unto the sounding of that lyre
4558,APPENDIX,"Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,"
4559,APPENDIX,Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.
4560,APPENDIX,
4561,APPENDIX,"“I am Angelic Love, that circle round"
4562,APPENDIX,The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb
4563,APPENDIX,That was the hostelry of our Desire;
4564,APPENDIX,
4565,APPENDIX,"And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while"
4566,APPENDIX,"Thou followest thy Son, and mak’st diviner"
4567,APPENDIX,"The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.”"
4568,APPENDIX,
4569,APPENDIX,Thus did the circulated melody
4570,APPENDIX,Seal itself up; and all the other lights
4571,APPENDIX,Were making to resound the name of Mary.
4572,APPENDIX,
4573,APPENDIX,The regal mantle of the volumes all
4574,APPENDIX,"Of that world, which most fervid is and living"
4575,APPENDIX,"With breath of God and with his works and ways,"
4576,APPENDIX,
4577,APPENDIX,"Extended over us its inner border,"
4578,APPENDIX,"So very distant, that the semblance of it"
4579,APPENDIX,There where I was not yet appeared to me.
4580,APPENDIX,
4581,APPENDIX,Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power
4582,APPENDIX,"Of following the incoronated flame,"
4583,APPENDIX,Which mounted upward near to its own seed.
4584,APPENDIX,
4585,APPENDIX,"And as a little child, that towards its mother"
4586,APPENDIX,"Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,"
4587,APPENDIX,"Through impulse kindled into outward flame,"
4588,APPENDIX,
4589,APPENDIX,Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached
4590,APPENDIX,"So with its summit, that the deep affection"
4591,APPENDIX,They had for Mary was revealed to me.
4592,APPENDIX,
4593,APPENDIX,"Thereafter they remained there in my sight,"
4594,APPENDIX,"‘Regina coeli’ singing with such sweetness,"
4595,APPENDIX,That ne’er from me has the delight departed.
4596,APPENDIX,
4597,APPENDIX,"O, what exuberance is garnered up"
4598,APPENDIX,"Within those richest coffers, which had been"
4599,APPENDIX,Good husbandmen for sowing here below!
4600,APPENDIX,
4601,APPENDIX,There they enjoy and live upon the treasure
4602,APPENDIX,Which was acquired while weeping in the exile
4603,APPENDIX,"Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left."
4604,APPENDIX,
4605,APPENDIX,"There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son"
4606,APPENDIX,"Of God and Mary, in his victory,"
4607,APPENDIX,"Both with the ancient council and the new,"
4608,APPENDIX,
4609,APPENDIX,He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.

4626,APPENDIX,And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are
4627,APPENDIX,For ever at the fount whence comes his thought.”
4628,APPENDIX,
4629,APPENDIX,Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified
4630,APPENDIX,"Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,"
4631,APPENDIX,Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.
4632,APPENDIX,
4633,APPENDIX,And as the wheels in works of horologes

4635,APPENDIX,"Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,"

4637,APPENDIX,"So in like manner did those carols, dancing"

4640,APPENDIX,
4641,APPENDIX,From that one which I noted of most beauty
4642,APPENDIX,Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy
4643,APPENDIX,That none it left there of a greater brightness;
4644,APPENDIX,
4645,APPENDIX,And around Beatrice three several times
4646,APPENDIX,"It whirled itself with so divine a song,"
4647,APPENDIX,My fantasy repeats it not to me;
4648,APPENDIX,
4649,APPENDIX,"Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,"
4650,APPENDIX,"Since our imagination for such folds,"
4651,APPENDIX,"Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring."
4652,APPENDIX,
4653,APPENDIX,"“O holy sister mine, who us implorest"
4654,APPENDIX,"With such devotion, by thine ardent love"
4655,APPENDIX,Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!”
4656,APPENDIX,
4657,APPENDIX,"Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire"
4658,APPENDIX,"Unto my Lady did direct its breath,"
4659,APPENDIX,Which spake in fashion as I here have said.
4660,APPENDIX,
4661,APPENDIX,And she: “O light eterne of the great man
4662,APPENDIX,To whom our Lord delivered up the keys
4663,APPENDIX,"He carried down of this miraculous joy,"
4664,APPENDIX,
4665,APPENDIX,"This one examine on points light and grave,"

4667,APPENDIX,By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.
4668,APPENDIX,
4669,APPENDIX,"If he love well, and hope well, and believe,"
4670,APPENDIX,From thee ’tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight
4671,APPENDIX,There where depicted everything is seen.
4672,APPENDIX,
4673,APPENDIX,But since this kingdom has made citizens
4674,APPENDIX,"By means of the true Faith, to glorify it"
4675,APPENDIX,’Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.”
4676,APPENDIX,
4677,APPENDIX,"As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not"
4678,APPENDIX,"Until the master doth propose the question,"
4679,APPENDIX,"To argue it, and not to terminate it,"
4680,APPENDIX,
4681,APPENDIX,"So did I arm myself with every reason,"
4682,APPENDIX,"While she was speaking, that I might be ready"
4683,APPENDIX,For such a questioner and such profession.
4684,APPENDIX,
4685,APPENDIX,"“Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;"
4686,APPENDIX,What is the Faith?” Whereat I raised my brow
4687,APPENDIX,Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.
4688,APPENDIX,
4689,APPENDIX,"Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she"
4690,APPENDIX,Prompt signals made to me that I should pour
4691,APPENDIX,The water forth from my internal fountain.
4692,APPENDIX,
4693,APPENDIX,"“May grace, that suffers me to make confession,”"
4694,APPENDIX,"Began I, “to the great centurion,"

4700,APPENDIX,
4701,APPENDIX,"Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,"

4703,APPENDIX,And this appears to me its quiddity.”
4704,APPENDIX,
4705,APPENDIX,"Then heard I: “Very rightly thou perceivest,"
4706,APPENDIX,If well thou understandest why he placed it
4707,APPENDIX,With substances and then with evidences.”
4708,APPENDIX,
4709,APPENDIX,"And I thereafterward: “The things profound,"
4710,APPENDIX,"That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,"
4711,APPENDIX,"Unto all eyes below are so concealed,"
4712,APPENDIX,
4713,APPENDIX,"That they exist there only in belief,"
4714,APPENDIX,"Upon the which is founded the high hope,"
4715,APPENDIX,And hence it takes the nature of a substance.
4716,APPENDIX,
4717,APPENDIX,And it behoveth us from this belief
4718,APPENDIX,"To reason without having other sight,"
4719,APPENDIX,And hence it has the nature of evidence.”
4720,APPENDIX,
4721,APPENDIX,Then heard I: “If whatever is acquired
4722,APPENDIX,"Below by doctrine were thus understood,"
4723,APPENDIX,No sophist’s subtlety would there find place.”
4724,APPENDIX,
4725,APPENDIX,Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;
4726,APPENDIX,Then added: “Very well has been gone over
4727,APPENDIX,Already of this coin the alloy and weight;
4728,APPENDIX,
4729,APPENDIX,But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?”
4730,APPENDIX,"And I: “Yes, both so shining and so round"
4731,APPENDIX,That in its stamp there is no peradventure.”
4732,APPENDIX,
4733,APPENDIX,Thereafter issued from the light profound
4734,APPENDIX,"That there resplendent was: “This precious jewel,"
4735,APPENDIX,"Upon the which is every virtue founded,"
4736,APPENDIX,
4737,APPENDIX,Whence hadst thou it?” And I: “The large outpouring
4738,APPENDIX,"Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused"
4739,APPENDIX,"Upon the ancient parchments and the new,"
4740,APPENDIX,
4741,APPENDIX,"A syllogism is, which proved it to me"
4742,APPENDIX,"With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,"
4743,APPENDIX,All demonstration seems to me obtuse.”
4744,APPENDIX,
4745,APPENDIX,And then I heard: “The ancient and the new
4746,APPENDIX,"Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,"
4747,APPENDIX,Why dost thou take them for the word divine?”
4748,APPENDIX,
4749,APPENDIX,"And I: “The proofs, which show the truth to me,"
4750,APPENDIX,"Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature"
4751,APPENDIX,"Ne’er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.”"
4752,APPENDIX,
4753,APPENDIX,"’Twas answered me: “Say, who assureth thee"
4754,APPENDIX,That those works ever were? the thing itself
4755,APPENDIX,"That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.”"
4756,APPENDIX,
4757,APPENDIX,"“Were the world to Christianity converted,”"
4758,APPENDIX,"I said, “withouten miracles, this one"
4759,APPENDIX,"Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;"
4760,APPENDIX,
4761,APPENDIX,Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter
4762,APPENDIX,"Into the field to sow there the good plant,"
4763,APPENDIX,Which was a vine and has become a thorn!”
4764,APPENDIX,
4765,APPENDIX,"This being finished, the high, holy Court"
4766,APPENDIX,"Resounded through the spheres, “One God we praise!”"
4767,APPENDIX,In melody that there above is chanted.
4768,APPENDIX,
4769,APPENDIX,"And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,"
4770,APPENDIX,"Examining, had thus conducted me,"
4771,APPENDIX,"Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,"
4772,APPENDIX,
4773,APPENDIX,Again began: “The Grace that dallying
4774,APPENDIX,"Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,"
4775,APPENDIX,"Up to this point, as it should opened be,"
4776,APPENDIX,
4777,APPENDIX,So that I do approve what forth emerged;
4778,APPENDIX,"But now thou must express what thou believest,"
4779,APPENDIX,And whence to thy belief it was presented.”
4780,APPENDIX,
4781,APPENDIX,"“O holy father, spirit who beholdest"
4782,APPENDIX,"What thou believedst so that thou o’ercamest,"
4783,APPENDIX,"Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,”"

4787,APPENDIX,And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.
4788,APPENDIX,
4789,APPENDIX,"And I respond: In one God I believe,"
4790,APPENDIX,"Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens"
4791,APPENDIX,"With love and with desire, himself unmoved;"
4792,APPENDIX,
4793,APPENDIX,And of such faith not only have I proofs

4795,APPENDIX,Likewise the truth that from this place rains down
4796,APPENDIX,
4797,APPENDIX,"Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,"
4798,APPENDIX,"Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote"

4801,APPENDIX,"In Persons three eterne believe, and these"
4802,APPENDIX,"One essence I believe, so one and trine"

4804,APPENDIX,
4805,APPENDIX,With the profound condition and divine
4806,APPENDIX,"Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind"
4807,APPENDIX,Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.
4808,APPENDIX,
4809,APPENDIX,"This the beginning is, this is the spark"
4810,APPENDIX,"Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,"
4811,APPENDIX,"And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.”"
4812,APPENDIX,
4813,APPENDIX,Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him
4814,APPENDIX,"His servant straight embraces, gratulating"

4854,APPENDIX,"Near his companion, both of them pour forth,"
4855,APPENDIX,"Circling about and murmuring, their affection,"
4856,APPENDIX,
4857,APPENDIX,So one beheld I by the other grand
4858,APPENDIX,"Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,"
4859,APPENDIX,Lauding the food that there above is eaten.
4860,APPENDIX,
4861,APPENDIX,"But when their gratulations were complete,"
4862,APPENDIX,"Silently ‘coram me’ each one stood still,"
4863,APPENDIX,So incandescent it o’ercame my sight.
4864,APPENDIX,
4865,APPENDIX,"Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:"
4866,APPENDIX,"“Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions"
4867,APPENDIX,"Of our Basilica have been described,"
4868,APPENDIX,
4869,APPENDIX,Make Hope resound within this altitude;
4870,APPENDIX,Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it
4871,APPENDIX,As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.”—
4872,APPENDIX,
4873,APPENDIX,"“Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;"
4874,APPENDIX,For what comes hither from the mortal world
4875,APPENDIX,Must needs be ripened in our radiance.”
4876,APPENDIX,
4877,APPENDIX,This comfort came to me from the second fire;
4878,APPENDIX,"Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,"
4879,APPENDIX,Which bent them down before with too great weight.
4880,APPENDIX,
4881,APPENDIX,"“Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou"
4882,APPENDIX,"Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,"
4883,APPENDIX,"In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,"
4884,APPENDIX,
4885,APPENDIX,"So that, the truth beholden of this court,"
4886,APPENDIX,"Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,"
4887,APPENDIX,"Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,"
4888,APPENDIX,
4889,APPENDIX,"Say what it is, and how is flowering with it"
4890,APPENDIX,"Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.”"
4891,APPENDIX,Thus did the second light again continue.
4892,APPENDIX,
4893,APPENDIX,"And the Compassionate, who piloted"
4894,APPENDIX,"The plumage of my wings in such high flight,"
4895,APPENDIX,Did in reply anticipate me thus:
4896,APPENDIX,
4897,APPENDIX,“No child whatever the Church Militant
4898,APPENDIX,"Of greater hope possesses, as is written"
4899,APPENDIX,In that Sun which irradiates all our band;
4900,APPENDIX,
4901,APPENDIX,Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt
4902,APPENDIX,"To come into Jerusalem to see,"
4903,APPENDIX,Or ever yet his warfare be completed.
4904,APPENDIX,
4905,APPENDIX,"The two remaining points, that not for knowledge"
4906,APPENDIX,"Have been demanded, but that he report"
4907,APPENDIX,"How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,"
4908,APPENDIX,
4909,APPENDIX,"To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,"
4910,APPENDIX,Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;
4911,APPENDIX,And may the grace of God in this assist him!”
4912,APPENDIX,
4913,APPENDIX,"As a disciple, who his teacher follows,"
4914,APPENDIX,"Ready and willing, where he is expert,"
4915,APPENDIX,"That his proficiency may be displayed,"
4916,APPENDIX,
4917,APPENDIX,"“Hope,” said I, “is the certain expectation"
4918,APPENDIX,"Of future glory, which is the effect"
4919,APPENDIX,Of grace divine and merit precedent.
4920,APPENDIX,
4921,APPENDIX,From many stars this light comes unto me;
4922,APPENDIX,But he instilled it first into my heart
4923,APPENDIX,Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.
4924,APPENDIX,
4925,APPENDIX,"‘Sperent in te,’ in the high Theody"
4926,APPENDIX,"He sayeth, ‘those who know thy name;’ and who"
4927,APPENDIX,"Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?"
4928,APPENDIX,
4929,APPENDIX,"Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling"
4930,APPENDIX,"In the Epistle, so that I am full,"
4931,APPENDIX,And upon others rain again your rain.”
4932,APPENDIX,
4933,APPENDIX,"While I was speaking, in the living bosom"
4934,APPENDIX,"Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,"
4935,APPENDIX,"Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;"
4936,APPENDIX,
4937,APPENDIX,Then breathed: “The love wherewith I am inflamed
4938,APPENDIX,Towards the virtue still which followed me
4939,APPENDIX,"Unto the palm and issue of the field,"
4940,APPENDIX,
4941,APPENDIX,Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight
4942,APPENDIX,In her; and grateful to me is thy telling
4943,APPENDIX,Whatever things Hope promises to thee.”
4944,APPENDIX,
4945,APPENDIX,And I: “The ancient Scriptures and the new
4946,APPENDIX,"The mark establish, and this shows it me,"
4947,APPENDIX,Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.
4948,APPENDIX,
4949,APPENDIX,"Isaiah saith, that each one garmented"
4950,APPENDIX,"In his own land shall be with twofold garments,"
4951,APPENDIX,And his own land is this delightful life.
4952,APPENDIX,
4953,APPENDIX,"Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,"
4954,APPENDIX,"There where he treateth of the robes of white,"
4955,APPENDIX,This revelation manifests to us.”
4956,APPENDIX,
4957,APPENDIX,"And first, and near the ending of these words,"
4958,APPENDIX,"“Sperent in te” from over us was heard,"
4959,APPENDIX,To which responsive answered all the carols.
4960,APPENDIX,
4961,APPENDIX,"Thereafterward a light among them brightened,"
4962,APPENDIX,"So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,"
4963,APPENDIX,Winter would have a month of one sole day.
4964,APPENDIX,
4965,APPENDIX,"And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance"
4966,APPENDIX,"A winsome maiden, only to do honour"
4967,APPENDIX,"To the new bride, and not from any failing,"
4968,APPENDIX,
4969,APPENDIX,Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour
4970,APPENDIX,"Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved"
4971,APPENDIX,As was beseeming to their ardent love.
4972,APPENDIX,
4973,APPENDIX,Into the song and music there it entered;
4974,APPENDIX,"And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,"
4975,APPENDIX,Even as a bride silent and motionless.
4976,APPENDIX,
4977,APPENDIX,“This is the one who lay upon the breast
4978,APPENDIX,Of him our Pelican; and this is he
4979,APPENDIX,To the great office from the cross elected.”
4980,APPENDIX,
4981,APPENDIX,My Lady thus; but therefore none the more
4982,APPENDIX,Did move her sight from its attentive gaze
4983,APPENDIX,Before or afterward these words of hers.
4984,APPENDIX,
4985,APPENDIX,"Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours"
4986,APPENDIX,"To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,"
4987,APPENDIX,"And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,"
4988,APPENDIX,
4989,APPENDIX,"So I became before that latest fire,"
4990,APPENDIX,"While it was said, “Why dost thou daze thyself"
4991,APPENDIX,To see a thing which here hath no existence?
4992,APPENDIX,
4993,APPENDIX,"Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be"
4994,APPENDIX,"With all the others there, until our number"
4995,APPENDIX,With the eternal proposition tallies.
4996,APPENDIX,
4997,APPENDIX,With the two garments in the blessed cloister
4998,APPENDIX,Are the two lights alone that have ascended:
4999,APPENDIX,And this shalt thou take back into your world.”
5000,APPENDIX,
5001,APPENDIX,And at this utterance the flaming circle
5002,APPENDIX,"Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling"
5003,APPENDIX,"Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,"
5004,APPENDIX,
5005,APPENDIX,As to escape from danger or fatigue
5006,APPENDIX,The oars that erst were in the water beaten
5007,APPENDIX,Are all suspended at a whistle’s sound.
5008,APPENDIX,
5009,APPENDIX,"Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,"
5010,APPENDIX,"When I turned round to look on Beatrice,"
5011,APPENDIX,"That her I could not see, although I was"

5022,APPENDIX,Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it
5023,APPENDIX,"Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,"
5024,APPENDIX,
5025,APPENDIX,Saying: “While thou recoverest the sense

5037,APPENDIX,"I said: “As pleaseth her, or soon or late"

5040,APPENDIX,

5047,APPENDIX,To speak still farther put it in my thought;

5051,APPENDIX,To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.”
5052,APPENDIX,
5053,APPENDIX,"And I: “By philosophic arguments,"
5054,APPENDIX,"And by authority that hence descends,"
5055,APPENDIX,Such love must needs imprint itself in me;
5056,APPENDIX,
5057,APPENDIX,"For Good, so far as good, when comprehended"
5058,APPENDIX,"Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater"
5059,APPENDIX,As more of goodness in itself it holds;
5060,APPENDIX,
5061,APPENDIX,Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage
5062,APPENDIX,That every good which out of it is found
5063,APPENDIX,Is nothing but a ray of its own light)
5064,APPENDIX,
5065,APPENDIX,More than elsewhither must the mind be moved
5066,APPENDIX,"Of every one, in loving, who discerns"
5067,APPENDIX,The truth in which this evidence is founded.
5068,APPENDIX,
5069,APPENDIX,Such truth he to my intellect reveals
5070,APPENDIX,Who demonstrates to me the primal love
5071,APPENDIX,Of all the sempiternal substances.
5072,APPENDIX,
5073,APPENDIX,"The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,"
5074,APPENDIX,"Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,"
5075,APPENDIX,‘I will make all my goodness pass before thee.’
5076,APPENDIX,
5077,APPENDIX,"Thou too revealest it to me, beginning"
5078,APPENDIX,"The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret"
5079,APPENDIX,Of heaven to earth above all other edict.”
5080,APPENDIX,
5081,APPENDIX,And I heard say: “By human intellect

5083,APPENDIX,Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.
5084,APPENDIX,
5085,APPENDIX,"But say again if other cords thou feelest,"
5086,APPENDIX,"Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim"

5088,APPENDIX,
5089,APPENDIX,The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ
5090,APPENDIX,"Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived"
5091,APPENDIX,Whither he fain would my profession lead.
5092,APPENDIX,
5093,APPENDIX,Therefore I recommenced: “All of those bites

5108,APPENDIX,
5109,APPENDIX,"As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet"
5110,APPENDIX,"Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady"
5111,APPENDIX,"Said with the others, “Holy, holy, holy!”"
5112,APPENDIX,
5113,APPENDIX,And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep
5114,APPENDIX,By reason of the visual spirit that runs
5115,APPENDIX,"Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,"
5116,APPENDIX,
5117,APPENDIX,"And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,"
5118,APPENDIX,"So all unconscious is his sudden waking,"
5119,APPENDIX,"Until the judgment cometh to his aid,"
5120,APPENDIX,
5121,APPENDIX,So from before mine eyes did Beatrice
5122,APPENDIX,"Chase every mote with radiance of her own,"
5123,APPENDIX,That cast its light a thousand miles and more.
5124,APPENDIX,
5125,APPENDIX,"Whence better after than before I saw,"
5126,APPENDIX,And in a kind of wonderment I asked
5127,APPENDIX,About a fourth light that I saw with us.
5128,APPENDIX,
5129,APPENDIX,And said my Lady: “There within those rays
5130,APPENDIX,Gazes upon its Maker the first soul
5131,APPENDIX,That ever the first virtue did create.”
5132,APPENDIX,
5133,APPENDIX,Even as the bough that downward bends its top
5134,APPENDIX,"At transit of the wind, and then is lifted"
5135,APPENDIX,"By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,"
5136,APPENDIX,
5137,APPENDIX,"Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,"
5138,APPENDIX,"Being amazed, and then I was made bold"
5139,APPENDIX,By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.
5140,APPENDIX,
5141,APPENDIX,"And I began: “O apple, that mature"
5142,APPENDIX,"Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,"
5143,APPENDIX,"To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,"
5144,APPENDIX,
5145,APPENDIX,Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee
5146,APPENDIX,That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;
5147,APPENDIX,"And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.”"
5148,APPENDIX,
5149,APPENDIX,"Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles"
5150,APPENDIX,"So that his impulse needs must be apparent,"
5151,APPENDIX,By reason of the wrappage following it;
5152,APPENDIX,
5153,APPENDIX,And in like manner the primeval soul
5154,APPENDIX,Made clear to me athwart its covering
5155,APPENDIX,How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.
5156,APPENDIX,
5157,APPENDIX,"Then breathed: “Without thy uttering it to me,"
5158,APPENDIX,Thine inclination better I discern
5159,APPENDIX,Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;
5160,APPENDIX,
5161,APPENDIX,"For I behold it in the truthful mirror,"
5162,APPENDIX,"That of Himself all things parhelion makes,"
5163,APPENDIX,And none makes Him parhelion of itself.
5164,APPENDIX,
5165,APPENDIX,Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me
5166,APPENDIX,"Within the lofty garden, where this Lady"
5167,APPENDIX,Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.
5168,APPENDIX,
5169,APPENDIX,"And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,"
5170,APPENDIX,"And of the great disdain the proper cause,"
5171,APPENDIX,And the language that I used and that I made.
5172,APPENDIX,
5173,APPENDIX,"Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree"
5174,APPENDIX,"Not in itself was cause of so great exile,"
5175,APPENDIX,But solely the o’erstepping of the bounds.
5176,APPENDIX,
5177,APPENDIX,"There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,"
5178,APPENDIX,Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits
5179,APPENDIX,"Made by the sun, this Council I desired;"
5180,APPENDIX,
5181,APPENDIX,And him I saw return to all the lights
5182,APPENDIX,"Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,"
5183,APPENDIX,Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.
5184,APPENDIX,
5185,APPENDIX,The language that I spake was quite extinct

5197,APPENDIX,"Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,"

5345,APPENDIX,The virtue that her look endowed me with
5346,APPENDIX,"From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,"

5457,APPENDIX,"And this was by another circumcinct,"

5469,APPENDIX,And that one had its flame most crystalline

5472,APPENDIX,
5473,APPENDIX,"My Lady, who in my anxiety"

5475,APPENDIX,Dependent is the heaven and nature all.
5476,APPENDIX,
5477,APPENDIX,"Behold that circle most conjoined to it,"
5478,APPENDIX,"And know thou, that its motion is so swift"

5480,APPENDIX,
5481,APPENDIX,And I to her: “If the world were arranged
5482,APPENDIX,"In the order which I see in yonder wheels,"
5483,APPENDIX,What’s set before me would have satisfied me;
5484,APPENDIX,
5485,APPENDIX,But in the world of sense we can perceive
5486,APPENDIX,That evermore the circles are diviner
5487,APPENDIX,As they are from the centre more remote
5488,APPENDIX,
5489,APPENDIX,Wherefore if my desire is to be ended
5490,APPENDIX,"In this miraculous and angelic temple,"
5491,APPENDIX,"That has for confines only love and light,"
5492,APPENDIX,
5493,APPENDIX,To hear behoves me still how the example

5501,APPENDIX,My Lady thus; then said she: “Do thou take
5502,APPENDIX,"What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,"
5503,APPENDIX,And exercise on that thy subtlety.
5504,APPENDIX,
5505,APPENDIX,The circles corporal are wide and narrow

5507,APPENDIX,Which is distributed through all their parts.
5508,APPENDIX,
5509,APPENDIX,"The greater goodness works the greater weal,"
5510,APPENDIX,"The greater weal the greater body holds,"
5511,APPENDIX,If perfect equally are all its parts.
5512,APPENDIX,
5513,APPENDIX,Therefore this one which sweeps along with it
5514,APPENDIX,"The universe sublime, doth correspond"
5515,APPENDIX,Unto the circle which most loves and knows.
5516,APPENDIX,
5517,APPENDIX,"On which account, if thou unto the virtue"

5543,APPENDIX,More millions than the doubling of the chess.
5544,APPENDIX,
5545,APPENDIX,I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir
5546,APPENDIX,"To the fixed point which holds them at the ‘Ubi,’"

5556,APPENDIX,
5557,APPENDIX,"Those other Loves, that round about them go,"
5558,APPENDIX,"Thrones of the countenance divine are called,"
5559,APPENDIX,Because they terminate the primal Triad.
5560,APPENDIX,
5561,APPENDIX,And thou shouldst know that they all have delight
5562,APPENDIX,As much as their own vision penetrates
5563,APPENDIX,"The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest."
5564,APPENDIX,
5565,APPENDIX,From this it may be seen how blessedness
5566,APPENDIX,"Is founded in the faculty which sees,"
5567,APPENDIX,"And not in that which loves, and follows next;"
5568,APPENDIX,
5569,APPENDIX,"And of this seeing merit is the measure,"
5570,APPENDIX,"Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;"
5571,APPENDIX,Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.

5584,APPENDIX,

5587,APPENDIX,The last is wholly of angelic sports.
5588,APPENDIX,

5592,APPENDIX,

5816,APPENDIX,
5817,APPENDIX,When the mid-heaven begins to make itself
5818,APPENDIX,"So deep to us, that here and there a star"
5819,APPENDIX,"Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,"
5820,APPENDIX,
5821,APPENDIX,And as advances bright exceedingly
5822,APPENDIX,"The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed"
5823,APPENDIX,Light after light to the most beautiful;
5824,APPENDIX,
5825,APPENDIX,"Not otherwise the Triumph, which for ever"
5826,APPENDIX,"Plays round about the point that vanquished me,"
5827,APPENDIX,"Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,"
5828,APPENDIX,
5829,APPENDIX,Little by little from my vision faded;
5830,APPENDIX,Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice
5831,APPENDIX,My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.
5832,APPENDIX,
5833,APPENDIX,If what has hitherto been said of her
5834,APPENDIX,"Were all concluded in a single praise,"
5835,APPENDIX,Scant would it be to serve the present turn.
5836,APPENDIX,
5837,APPENDIX,Not only does the beauty I beheld
5838,APPENDIX,"Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe"
5839,APPENDIX,Its Maker only may enjoy it all.
5840,APPENDIX,
5841,APPENDIX,Vanquished do I confess me by this passage
5842,APPENDIX,More than by problem of his theme was ever
5843,APPENDIX,O’ercome the comic or the tragic poet;
5844,APPENDIX,
5845,APPENDIX,"For as the sun the sight that trembles most,"
5846,APPENDIX,Even so the memory of that sweet smile
5847,APPENDIX,My mind depriveth of its very self.
5848,APPENDIX,
5849,APPENDIX,From the first day that I beheld her face
5850,APPENDIX,"In this life, to the moment of this look,"
5851,APPENDIX,The sequence of my song has ne’er been severed;
5852,APPENDIX,
5853,APPENDIX,But now perforce this sequence must desist
5854,APPENDIX,"From following her beauty with my verse,"
5855,APPENDIX,As every artist at his uttermost.
5856,APPENDIX,
5857,APPENDIX,Such as I leave her to a greater fame
5858,APPENDIX,"Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing"
5859,APPENDIX,"Its arduous matter to a final close,"
5860,APPENDIX,
5861,APPENDIX,With voice and gesture of a perfect leader
5862,APPENDIX,She recommenced: “We from the greatest body
5863,APPENDIX,Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;
5864,APPENDIX,
5865,APPENDIX,"Light intellectual replete with love,"
5866,APPENDIX,"Love of true good replete with ecstasy,"
5867,APPENDIX,Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.
5868,APPENDIX,
5869,APPENDIX,Here shalt thou see the one host and the other
5870,APPENDIX,"Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects"
5871,APPENDIX,Which at the final judgment thou shalt see.”
5872,APPENDIX,
5873,APPENDIX,Even as a sudden lightning that disperses
5874,APPENDIX,"The visual spirits, so that it deprives"
5875,APPENDIX,"The eye of impress from the strongest objects,"
5876,APPENDIX,
5877,APPENDIX,"Thus round about me flashed a living light,"
5878,APPENDIX,And left me swathed around with such a veil
5879,APPENDIX,"Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw."
5880,APPENDIX,
5881,APPENDIX,“Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven
5882,APPENDIX,"Welcomes into itself with such salute,"
5883,APPENDIX,To make the candle ready for its flame.”
5884,APPENDIX,
5885,APPENDIX,No sooner had within me these brief words
5886,APPENDIX,"An entrance found, than I perceived myself"
5887,APPENDIX,"To be uplifted over my own power,"
5888,APPENDIX,
5889,APPENDIX,"And I with vision new rekindled me,"
5890,APPENDIX,Such that no light whatever is so pure
5891,APPENDIX,But that mine eyes were fortified against it.
5892,APPENDIX,
5893,APPENDIX,And light I saw in fashion of a river
5894,APPENDIX,"Fulvid with its effulgence, ’twixt two banks"
5895,APPENDIX,Depicted with an admirable Spring.
5896,APPENDIX,
5897,APPENDIX,"Out of this river issued living sparks,"
5898,APPENDIX,"And on all sides sank down into the flowers,"
5899,APPENDIX,Like unto rubies that are set in gold;
5900,APPENDIX,
5901,APPENDIX,"And then, as if inebriate with the odours,"
5902,APPENDIX,"They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,"
5903,APPENDIX,And as one entered issued forth another.
5904,APPENDIX,
5905,APPENDIX,"“The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee"
5906,APPENDIX,"To have intelligence of what thou seest,"
5907,APPENDIX,"Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells."
5908,APPENDIX,
5909,APPENDIX,But of this water it behoves thee drink
5910,APPENDIX,Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.”
5911,APPENDIX,Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;
5912,APPENDIX,
5913,APPENDIX,And added: “The river and the topazes
5914,APPENDIX,"Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,"
5915,APPENDIX,Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;
5916,APPENDIX,
5917,APPENDIX,"Not that these things are difficult in themselves,"
5918,APPENDIX,"But the deficiency is on thy side,"
5919,APPENDIX,For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.”
5920,APPENDIX,
5921,APPENDIX,There is no babe that leaps so suddenly
5922,APPENDIX,"With face towards the milk, if he awake"
5923,APPENDIX,"Much later than his usual custom is,"
5924,APPENDIX,
5925,APPENDIX,"As I did, that I might make better mirrors"
5926,APPENDIX,"Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave"
5927,APPENDIX,Which flows that we therein be better made.
5928,APPENDIX,
5929,APPENDIX,And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids
5930,APPENDIX,"Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me"
5931,APPENDIX,Out of its length to be transformed to round.
5932,APPENDIX,
5933,APPENDIX,Then as a folk who have been under masks
5934,APPENDIX,"Seem other than before, if they divest"
5935,APPENDIX,"The semblance not their own they disappeared in,"
5936,APPENDIX,
5937,APPENDIX,Thus into greater pomp were changed for me
5938,APPENDIX,"The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw"
5939,APPENDIX,Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.
5940,APPENDIX,
5941,APPENDIX,O splendour of God! by means of which I saw
5942,APPENDIX,"The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,"
5943,APPENDIX,Give me the power to say how it I saw!
5944,APPENDIX,
5945,APPENDIX,"There is a light above, which visible"
5946,APPENDIX,"Makes the Creator unto every creature,"
5947,APPENDIX,"Who only in beholding Him has peace,"
5948,APPENDIX,
5949,APPENDIX,And it expands itself in circular form
5950,APPENDIX,"To such extent, that its circumference"
5951,APPENDIX,Would be too large a girdle for the sun.
5952,APPENDIX,
5953,APPENDIX,The semblance of it is all made of rays
5954,APPENDIX,"Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,"
5955,APPENDIX,Which takes therefrom vitality and power.
5956,APPENDIX,
5957,APPENDIX,And as a hill in water at its base
5958,APPENDIX,"Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty"
5959,APPENDIX,"When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,"
5960,APPENDIX,
5961,APPENDIX,"So, ranged aloft all round about the light,"
5962,APPENDIX,Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand
5963,APPENDIX,All who above there have from us returned.
5964,APPENDIX,
5965,APPENDIX,And if the lowest row collect within it
5966,APPENDIX,"So great a light, how vast the amplitude"
5967,APPENDIX,Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!
5968,APPENDIX,
5969,APPENDIX,My vision in the vastness and the height
5970,APPENDIX,"Lost not itself, but comprehended all"
5971,APPENDIX,The quantity and quality of that gladness.
5972,APPENDIX,
5973,APPENDIX,There near and far nor add nor take away;
5974,APPENDIX,"For there where God immediately doth govern,"
5975,APPENDIX,The natural law in naught is relevant.
5976,APPENDIX,
5977,APPENDIX,Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal
5978,APPENDIX,"That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour"
5979,APPENDIX,"Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,"
5980,APPENDIX,
5981,APPENDIX,"As one who silent is and fain would speak,"
5982,APPENDIX,"Me Beatrice drew on, and said: “Behold"
5983,APPENDIX,Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!
5984,APPENDIX,
5985,APPENDIX,Behold how vast the circuit of our city!
5986,APPENDIX,"Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,"
5987,APPENDIX,That here henceforward are few people wanting!
5988,APPENDIX,
5989,APPENDIX,On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed
5990,APPENDIX,"For the crown’s sake already placed upon it,"
5991,APPENDIX,Before thou suppest at this wedding feast
5992,APPENDIX,
5993,APPENDIX,Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus
5994,APPENDIX,"On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come"
5995,APPENDIX,To redress Italy ere she be ready.
5996,APPENDIX,
5997,APPENDIX,"Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,"
5998,APPENDIX,"Has made you like unto the little child,"
5999,APPENDIX,Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.
6000,APPENDIX,
6001,APPENDIX,And in the sacred forum then shall be
6002,APPENDIX,"A Prefect such, that openly or covert"
6003,APPENDIX,On the same road he will not walk with him.
6004,APPENDIX,
6005,APPENDIX,But long of God he will not be endured
6006,APPENDIX,In holy office; he shall be thrust down
6007,APPENDIX,"Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,"
6008,APPENDIX,
6009,APPENDIX,And make him of Alagna lower go!”

6013,APPENDIX,
6014,APPENDIX,Paradiso: Canto XXXI
6015,APPENDIX,
6016,APPENDIX,
6017,APPENDIX,In fashion then as of a snow-white rose
6018,APPENDIX,"Displayed itself to me the saintly host,"
6019,APPENDIX,"Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,"
6020,APPENDIX,
6021,APPENDIX,"But the other host, that flying sees and sings"
6022,APPENDIX,"The glory of Him who doth enamour it,"
6023,APPENDIX,"And the goodness that created it so noble,"
6024,APPENDIX,
6025,APPENDIX,"Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers"
6026,APPENDIX,"One moment, and the next returns again"
6027,APPENDIX,"To where its labour is to sweetness turned,"
6028,APPENDIX,
6029,APPENDIX,"Sank into the great flower, that is adorned"
6030,APPENDIX,"With leaves so many, and thence reascended"
6031,APPENDIX,To where its love abideth evermore.
6032,APPENDIX,
6033,APPENDIX,"Their faces had they all of living flame,"
6034,APPENDIX,"And wings of gold, and all the rest so white"
6035,APPENDIX,No snow unto that limit doth attain.
6036,APPENDIX,
6037,APPENDIX,"From bench to bench, into the flower descending,"
6038,APPENDIX,They carried something of the peace and ardour
6039,APPENDIX,Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.
6040,APPENDIX,
6041,APPENDIX,Nor did the interposing ’twixt the flower
6042,APPENDIX,And what was o’er it of such plenitude
6043,APPENDIX,Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;
6044,APPENDIX,
6045,APPENDIX,Because the light divine so penetrates
6046,APPENDIX,"The universe, according to its merit,"
6047,APPENDIX,That naught can be an obstacle against it.
6048,APPENDIX,
6049,APPENDIX,"This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,"
6050,APPENDIX,"Crowded with ancient people and with modern,"
6051,APPENDIX,Unto one mark had all its look and love.
6052,APPENDIX,
6053,APPENDIX,"O Trinal Light, that in a single star"
6054,APPENDIX,"Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,"
6055,APPENDIX,Look down upon our tempest here below!
6056,APPENDIX,
6057,APPENDIX,"If the barbarians, coming from some region"
6058,APPENDIX,"That every day by Helice is covered,"
6059,APPENDIX,"Revolving with her son whom she delights in,"
6060,APPENDIX,
6061,APPENDIX,"Beholding Rome and all her noble works,"
6062,APPENDIX,"Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran"
6063,APPENDIX,"Above all mortal things was eminent,—"
6064,APPENDIX,
6065,APPENDIX,"I who to the divine had from the human,"
6066,APPENDIX,"From time unto eternity, had come,"
6067,APPENDIX,"From Florence to a people just and sane,"
6068,APPENDIX,
6069,APPENDIX,With what amazement must I have been filled!
6070,APPENDIX,"Truly between this and the joy, it was"
6071,APPENDIX,"My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute."
6072,APPENDIX,
6073,APPENDIX,And as a pilgrim who delighteth him
6074,APPENDIX,"In gazing round the temple of his vow,"
6075,APPENDIX,"And hopes some day to retell how it was,"
6076,APPENDIX,
6077,APPENDIX,So through the living light my way pursuing
6078,APPENDIX,"Directed I mine eyes o’er all the ranks,"
6079,APPENDIX,"Now up, now down, and now all round about."
6080,APPENDIX,
6081,APPENDIX,"Faces I saw of charity persuasive,"
6082,APPENDIX,"Embellished by His light and their own smile,"
6083,APPENDIX,And attitudes adorned with every grace.
6084,APPENDIX,
6085,APPENDIX,The general form of Paradise already
6086,APPENDIX,"My glance had comprehended as a whole,"
6087,APPENDIX,"In no part hitherto remaining fixed,"
6088,APPENDIX,
6089,APPENDIX,And round I turned me with rekindled wish
6090,APPENDIX,My Lady to interrogate of things
6091,APPENDIX,Concerning which my mind was in suspense.
6092,APPENDIX,
6093,APPENDIX,"One thing I meant, another answered me;"
6094,APPENDIX,"I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw"
6095,APPENDIX,An Old Man habited like the glorious people.
6096,APPENDIX,
6097,APPENDIX,O’erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks
6098,APPENDIX,"With joy benign, in attitude of pity"
6099,APPENDIX,As to a tender father is becoming.
6100,APPENDIX,
6101,APPENDIX,"And “She, where is she?” instantly I said;"
6102,APPENDIX,"Whence he: “To put an end to thy desire,"
6103,APPENDIX,Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.
6104,APPENDIX,
6105,APPENDIX,And if thou lookest up to the third round
6106,APPENDIX,"Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her"
6107,APPENDIX,Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.”
6108,APPENDIX,
6109,APPENDIX,"Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,"
6110,APPENDIX,"And saw her, as she made herself a crown"
6111,APPENDIX,Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.
6112,APPENDIX,
6113,APPENDIX,Not from that region which the highest thunders
6114,APPENDIX,"Is any mortal eye so far removed,"
6115,APPENDIX,"In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,"
6116,APPENDIX,
6117,APPENDIX,As there from Beatrice my sight; but this
6118,APPENDIX,Was nothing unto me; because her image
6119,APPENDIX,Descended not to me by medium blurred.
6120,APPENDIX,
6121,APPENDIX,"“O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,"
6122,APPENDIX,And who for my salvation didst endure
6123,APPENDIX,"In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,"
6124,APPENDIX,
6125,APPENDIX,"Of whatsoever things I have beheld,"
6126,APPENDIX,As coming from thy power and from thy goodness
6127,APPENDIX,I recognise the virtue and the grace.
6128,APPENDIX,
6129,APPENDIX,"Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,"
6130,APPENDIX,"By all those ways, by all the expedients,"
6131,APPENDIX,Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.
6132,APPENDIX,
6133,APPENDIX,"Preserve towards me thy magnificence,"
6134,APPENDIX,"So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,"
6135,APPENDIX,Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.”
6136,APPENDIX,
6137,APPENDIX,"Thus I implored; and she, so far away,"
6138,APPENDIX,"Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;"
6139,APPENDIX,Then unto the eternal fountain turned.
6140,APPENDIX,
6141,APPENDIX,And said the Old Man holy: “That thou mayst
6142,APPENDIX,"Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,"
6143,APPENDIX,"Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,"
6144,APPENDIX,
6145,APPENDIX,Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;
6146,APPENDIX,For seeing it will discipline thy sight
6147,APPENDIX,Farther to mount along the ray divine.
6148,APPENDIX,
6149,APPENDIX,"And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn"
6150,APPENDIX,"Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,"
6151,APPENDIX,Because that I her faithful Bernard am.”
6152,APPENDIX,
6153,APPENDIX,As he who peradventure from Croatia
6154,APPENDIX,"Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,"
6155,APPENDIX,"Who through its ancient fame is never sated,"
6156,APPENDIX,
6157,APPENDIX,"But says in thought, the while it is displayed,"
6158,APPENDIX,"“My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,"
6159,APPENDIX,Now was your semblance made like unto this?”
6160,APPENDIX,
6161,APPENDIX,Even such was I while gazing at the living
6162,APPENDIX,"Charity of the man, who in this world"
6163,APPENDIX,By contemplation tasted of that peace.
6164,APPENDIX,
6165,APPENDIX,"“Thou son of grace, this jocund life,” began he,"
6166,APPENDIX,“Will not be known to thee by keeping ever
6167,APPENDIX,Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;
6168,APPENDIX,
6169,APPENDIX,"But mark the circles to the most remote,"
6170,APPENDIX,Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen
6171,APPENDIX,To whom this realm is subject and devoted.”
6172,APPENDIX,
6173,APPENDIX,"I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn"
6174,APPENDIX,The oriental part of the horizon
6175,APPENDIX,"Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,"
6176,APPENDIX,
6177,APPENDIX,"Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale"
6178,APPENDIX,"To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness"
6179,APPENDIX,Surpass in splendour all the other front.
6180,APPENDIX,
6181,APPENDIX,And even as there where we await the pole
6182,APPENDIX,"That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more"
6183,APPENDIX,"The light, and is on either side diminished,"
6184,APPENDIX,
6185,APPENDIX,So likewise that pacific oriflamme
6186,APPENDIX,"Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side"
6187,APPENDIX,In equal measure did the flame abate.
6188,APPENDIX,
6189,APPENDIX,"And at that centre, with their wings expanded,"
6190,APPENDIX,"More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,"
6191,APPENDIX,Each differing in effulgence and in kind.
6192,APPENDIX,
6193,APPENDIX,I saw there at their sports and at their songs
6194,APPENDIX,"A beauty smiling, which the gladness was"
6195,APPENDIX,Within the eyes of all the other saints;
6196,APPENDIX,
6197,APPENDIX,And if I had in speaking as much wealth
6198,APPENDIX,"As in imagining, I should not dare"
6199,APPENDIX,To attempt the smallest part of its delight.
6200,APPENDIX,
6201,APPENDIX,"Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes"
6202,APPENDIX,"Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,"
6203,APPENDIX,His own with such affection turned to her
6204,APPENDIX,
6205,APPENDIX,That it made mine more ardent to behold.

6215,APPENDIX,And gave beginning to these holy words:
6216,APPENDIX,
6217,APPENDIX,"“The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,"
6218,APPENDIX,"She at her feet who is so beautiful,"
6219,APPENDIX,She is the one who opened it and pierced it.

6222,APPENDIX,"Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,"

6225,APPENDIX,"Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was"

6229,APPENDIX,Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending

6234,APPENDIX,"Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,"
6235,APPENDIX,Dividing all the tresses of the flower;
6236,APPENDIX,
6237,APPENDIX,"Because, according to the view which Faith"
6238,APPENDIX,"In Christ had taken, these are the partition"
6239,APPENDIX,By which the sacred stairways are divided.
6240,APPENDIX,
6241,APPENDIX,"Upon this side, where perfect is the flower"
6242,APPENDIX,"With each one of its petals, seated are"
6243,APPENDIX,Those who believed in Christ who was to come.
6244,APPENDIX,
6245,APPENDIX,"Upon the other side, where intersected"
6246,APPENDIX,"With vacant spaces are the semicircles,"
6247,APPENDIX,Are those who looked to Christ already come.

6251,APPENDIX,"Below it, such a great division make,"
6252,APPENDIX,
6253,APPENDIX,"So opposite doth that of the great John,"
6254,APPENDIX,"Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom"
6255,APPENDIX,"Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell."
6256,APPENDIX,
6257,APPENDIX,And under him thus to divide were chosen

6259,APPENDIX,And down to us the rest from round to round.
6260,APPENDIX,

6262,APPENDIX,For one and other aspect of the Faith
6263,APPENDIX,In equal measure shall this garden fill.

6267,APPENDIX,Not by their proper merit are they seated;
6268,APPENDIX,
6269,APPENDIX,But by another’s under fixed conditions;

6300,APPENDIX,
6301,APPENDIX,And this is clearly and expressly noted
6302,APPENDIX,"For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins"
6303,APPENDIX,Who in their mother had their anger roused.
6304,APPENDIX,
6305,APPENDIX,"According to the colour of the hair,"
6306,APPENDIX,"Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme"
6307,APPENDIX,Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.
6308,APPENDIX,
6309,APPENDIX,"Without, then, any merit of their deeds,"
6310,APPENDIX,"Stationed are they in different gradations,"
6311,APPENDIX,Differing only in their first acuteness.
6312,APPENDIX,
6313,APPENDIX,"’Tis true that in the early centuries,"
6314,APPENDIX,"With innocence, to work out their salvation"
6315,APPENDIX,Sufficient was the faith of parents only.
6316,APPENDIX,
6317,APPENDIX,"After the earlier ages were completed,"
6318,APPENDIX,Behoved it that the males by circumcision
6319,APPENDIX,Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;
6320,APPENDIX,
6321,APPENDIX,But after that the time of grace had come
6322,APPENDIX,"Without the baptism absolute of Christ,"
6323,APPENDIX,Such innocence below there was retained.
6324,APPENDIX,
6325,APPENDIX,Look now into the face that unto Christ
6326,APPENDIX,Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only
6327,APPENDIX,Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.”
6328,APPENDIX,
6329,APPENDIX,On her did I behold so great a gladness
6330,APPENDIX,"Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds"
6331,APPENDIX,"Created through that altitude to fly,"
6332,APPENDIX,
6333,APPENDIX,That whatsoever I had seen before
6334,APPENDIX,"Did not suspend me in such admiration,"
6335,APPENDIX,Nor show me such similitude of God.
6336,APPENDIX,
6337,APPENDIX,"And the same Love that first descended there,"
6338,APPENDIX,"“Ave Maria, gratia plena,” singing,"
6339,APPENDIX,In front of her his wings expanded wide.
6340,APPENDIX,
6341,APPENDIX,Unto the canticle divine responded
6342,APPENDIX,"From every part the court beatified,"
6343,APPENDIX,So that each sight became serener for it.
6344,APPENDIX,
6345,APPENDIX,"“O holy father, who for me endurest"
6346,APPENDIX,"To be below here, leaving the sweet place"
6347,APPENDIX,"In which thou sittest by eternal lot,"
6348,APPENDIX,
6349,APPENDIX,Who is the Angel that with so much joy
6350,APPENDIX,"Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,"
6351,APPENDIX,Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?”
6352,APPENDIX,
6353,APPENDIX,Thus I again recourse had to the teaching
6354,APPENDIX,Of that one who delighted him in Mary
6355,APPENDIX,As doth the star of morning in the sun.
6356,APPENDIX,
6357,APPENDIX,And he to me: “Such gallantry and grace
6358,APPENDIX,"As there can be in Angel and in soul,"
6359,APPENDIX,All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;
6360,APPENDIX,
6361,APPENDIX,Because he is the one who bore the palm
6362,APPENDIX,"Down unto Mary, when the Son of God"
6363,APPENDIX,To take our burden on himself decreed.
6364,APPENDIX,
6365,APPENDIX,"But now come onward with thine eyes, as I"
6366,APPENDIX,"Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians"
6367,APPENDIX,Of this most just and merciful of empires.
6368,APPENDIX,
6369,APPENDIX,Those two that sit above there most enrapture
6370,APPENDIX,"As being very near unto Augusta,"
6371,APPENDIX,Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.
6372,APPENDIX,
6373,APPENDIX,He who upon the left is near her placed
6374,APPENDIX,"The father is, by whose audacious taste"
6375,APPENDIX,The human species so much bitter tastes.
6376,APPENDIX,
6377,APPENDIX,Upon the right thou seest that ancient father
6378,APPENDIX,"Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ"
6379,APPENDIX,The keys committed of this lovely flower.
6380,APPENDIX,
6381,APPENDIX,"And he who all the evil days beheld,"

6383,APPENDIX,"Who with the spear and with the nails was won,"
6384,APPENDIX,
6385,APPENDIX,"Beside him sits, and by the other rests"
6386,APPENDIX,That leader under whom on manna lived
6387,APPENDIX,"The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked."
6388,APPENDIX,
6389,APPENDIX,"Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,"
6390,APPENDIX,"So well content to look upon her daughter,"
6391,APPENDIX,Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.
6392,APPENDIX,
6393,APPENDIX,And opposite the eldest household father
6394,APPENDIX,"Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved"
6395,APPENDIX,When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.
6396,APPENDIX,
6397,APPENDIX,"But since the moments of thy vision fly,"
6398,APPENDIX,"Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor"
6399,APPENDIX,"Who makes the gown according to his cloth,"
6400,APPENDIX,
6401,APPENDIX,"And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,"
6402,APPENDIX,That looking upon Him thou penetrate
6403,APPENDIX,As far as possible through his effulgence.
6404,APPENDIX,
6405,APPENDIX,"Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,"
6406,APPENDIX,"Moving thy wings believing to advance,"
6407,APPENDIX,By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;
6408,APPENDIX,
6409,APPENDIX,Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;
6410,APPENDIX,And thou shalt follow me with thy affection
6411,APPENDIX,That from my words thy heart turn not aside.”

6484,APPENDIX,
6485,APPENDIX,"Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,"
6486,APPENDIX,That I should upward look; but I already
6487,APPENDIX,Was of my own accord such as he wished;
6488,APPENDIX,
6489,APPENDIX,"Because my sight, becoming purified,"
6490,APPENDIX,Was entering more and more into the ray
6491,APPENDIX,Of the High Light which of itself is true.
6492,APPENDIX,
6493,APPENDIX,From that time forward what I saw was greater
6494,APPENDIX,"Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,"
6495,APPENDIX,And yields the memory unto such excess.
6496,APPENDIX,
6497,APPENDIX,"Even as he is who seeth in a dream,"

6516,APPENDIX,
6517,APPENDIX,"For by returning to my memory somewhat,"
6518,APPENDIX,"And by a little sounding in these verses,"
6519,APPENDIX,More of thy victory shall be conceived!
6520,APPENDIX,
6521,APPENDIX,I think the keenness of the living ray
6522,APPENDIX,"Which I endured would have bewildered me,"
6523,APPENDIX,If but mine eyes had been averted from it;
6524,APPENDIX,
6525,APPENDIX,And I remember that I was more bold

6528,APPENDIX,
6529,APPENDIX,"O grace abundant, by which I presumed"

6531,APPENDIX,So that the seeing I consumed therein!
6532,APPENDIX,
6533,APPENDIX,I saw that in its depth far down is lying
6534,APPENDIX,"Bound up with love together in one volume,"
6535,APPENDIX,What through the universe in leaves is scattered;
6536,APPENDIX,
6537,APPENDIX,"Substance, and accident, and their operations,"
6538,APPENDIX,All interfused together in such wise
6539,APPENDIX,That what I speak of is one simple light.
6540,APPENDIX,
6541,APPENDIX,The universal fashion of this knot
6542,APPENDIX,"Methinks I saw, since more abundantly"
6543,APPENDIX,In saying this I feel that I rejoice.
6544,APPENDIX,
6545,APPENDIX,"One moment is more lethargy to me,"
6546,APPENDIX,Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise
6547,APPENDIX,That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!
6548,APPENDIX,
6549,APPENDIX,"My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,"
6550,APPENDIX,"Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,"
6551,APPENDIX,And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.
6552,APPENDIX,
6553,APPENDIX,"In presence of that light one such becomes,"
6554,APPENDIX,That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect
6555,APPENDIX,It is impossible he e’er consent;
6556,APPENDIX,
6557,APPENDIX,"Because the good, which object is of will,"
6558,APPENDIX,"Is gathered all in this, and out of it"
6559,APPENDIX,That is defective which is perfect there.
6560,APPENDIX,
6561,APPENDIX,Shorter henceforward will my language fall
6562,APPENDIX,"Of what I yet remember, than an infant’s"
6563,APPENDIX,Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.
6564,APPENDIX,
6565,APPENDIX,Not because more than one unmingled semblance
6566,APPENDIX,"Was in the living light on which I looked,"
6567,APPENDIX,For it is always what it was before;
6568,APPENDIX,
6569,APPENDIX,"But through the sight, that fortified itself"
6570,APPENDIX,"In me by looking, one appearance only"
6571,APPENDIX,To me was ever changing as I changed.
6572,APPENDIX,
6573,APPENDIX,Within the deep and luminous subsistence
6574,APPENDIX,"Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,"
6575,APPENDIX,"Of threefold colour and of one dimension,"
6576,APPENDIX,
6577,APPENDIX,And by the second seemed the first reflected
6578,APPENDIX,"As Iris is by Iris, and the third"
6579,APPENDIX,Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.
6580,APPENDIX,
6581,APPENDIX,O how all speech is feeble and falls short
6582,APPENDIX,"Of my conceit, and this to what I saw"
6583,APPENDIX,"Is such, ’tis not enough to call it little!"
6584,APPENDIX,
6585,APPENDIX,"O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,"
6586,APPENDIX,"Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself"
6587,APPENDIX,"And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!"
6588,APPENDIX,
6589,APPENDIX,"That circulation, which being thus conceived"
6590,APPENDIX,"Appeared in thee as a reflected light,"
6591,APPENDIX,"When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,"
6592,APPENDIX,
6593,APPENDIX,"Within itself, of its own very colour"
6594,APPENDIX,"Seemed to me painted with our effigy,"
6595,APPENDIX,Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.
6596,APPENDIX,
6597,APPENDIX,"As the geometrician, who endeavours"
6598,APPENDIX,"To square the circle, and discovers not,"
6599,APPENDIX,"By taking thought, the principle he wants,"
6600,APPENDIX,
6601,APPENDIX,Even such was I at that new apparition;
6602,APPENDIX,I wished to see how the image to the circle
6603,APPENDIX,"Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;"
6604,APPENDIX,
6605,APPENDIX,"But my own wings were not enough for this,"
6606,APPENDIX,Had it not been that then my mind there smote
6607,APPENDIX,"A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish."
6608,APPENDIX,
6609,APPENDIX,Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:
6610,APPENDIX,"But now was turning my desire and will,"
6611,APPENDIX,"Even as a wheel that equally is moved,"

6613,APPENDIX,The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.
